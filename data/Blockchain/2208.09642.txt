ABSTRACT
Financial markets have evolved over centuries, and exchanges have
converged to rely on the order book mechanism for market making.
Latency on the blockchain, however, has prevented decentralized
exchanges (DEXes) from utilizing the order book mechanism and
instead gave rise to the development of market designs that are
better suited to a blockchain. Although the first widely popularized
DEX, Uniswap V2, stood out through its astonishing simplicity, a
recent design overhaul introduced with Uniswap V3 has introduced
increasing levels of complexity aiming to increase capital efficiency.
In this work, we empirically study the ability of Unsiwap V3 to
handle unexpected price shocks. Our analysis finds that the prices
on Uniswap V3 were inaccurate during the recent abrupt price
drops of two stablecoins: UST and USDT. We identify the lack of
agility required of Unsiwap V3 liquidity providers as the root cause
of these worrying price inaccuracies. Additionally, we outline that
there are too few incentives for liquidity providers to enter liquidity
pools, given the elevated volatility in such market conditions.

decentralized exchange, constant product market maker

1 INTRODUCTION
While the first stock markets date back at least to the 17th century
and have thus a long track record, their novel decentralized finance
(DeFi) counterpart: decentralized exchanges (DEXes) are still in their
teething phase. Most financial markets rely on an order book mech-
anism, where constant buy and sell orders determine the price in
an auction-like fashion. The price lies between the highest bid (buy
order) and lowest ask (sell order) and can adapt rapidly.

DEXes are built by smart contracts hosted on the blockchain,
mainly Ethereum [22], and the significant latency between subse-
quent blocks has generally prohibited the adoption of the order
book mechanism on the blockchain. Instead DEXes, generally func-
tion as constant function market makers (CFMMs). CFMMs rely on
a predetermined price curve for on-chain market making. Individ-
ual liquidity providers aggregate liquidity in what is referred to as
a liquidity pool for each tradeable cryptocurrency pair. Liquidity
providers are renumerated for their service through transaction
fees but bear the risk of high volatility.

The first widely popular CFMM was Uniswap V2 [9]. Uniswap
V2 functions as a constant product market maker (CPMM), where
liquidity providers supply liquidity on the entire price range. The
CPMM ensures that the product of the pool’s two reserved cryp-
tocurrencies remains constant. Thus, executed trades directly cause
price shifts in the market. Large price differences between mar-
kets give rise to arbitrage opportunities which arbitrage traders are
expected to exploit until the arbitrage opportunity vanishes.

Curve [1] later proposed a CFMM specialized in stablecoin (cryp-
tocurrencies designed to have stable prices) liquidity pools. Stable-
coins are often pegged to the US$ and should therefore trade at
an equal price. The CFMM proposed by Curve adapts the CPMM
to reduce price changes for a given trade size as long as stable-
coins are trading near their equal price. In a recent design overhaul,
Uniswap implemented an updated protocol V3 [10], where liquidity
providers have great freedom in selecting the price range for which
they wish to facilitate trading. This update was marketed, in part, to
be specially tailored for stablecoin pairs, as the more concentrated
liquidity distribution at the intended price should increase capital
efficiency.

For stablecoin pairs on Uniswap V3, the liquidity is highly con-
centrated around the equal price point of the two assets in the pool,
i.e., both assets trade at 1 US$. Thus, as soon as the price moves
outside an extremely narrow price range and the liquidity is not
adjusted accordingly, there is little to no liquidity left to support
trading. The concentrated liquidity CFMM introduced by Uniswap
V3 was tested in early May 2022. First, UST, a stablecoin with a
market capitalization of 18.7B US$ [6], lost its peg of 1 US$ on 7
May and plummeted to a couple of cents within days. USDT, the
largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of 83.2B US$, also
lost its peg of 1 US$ and temporarily traded at 94 cents on 11 May.
While USDT largely recovered from its price drop, UST did not.

In this work, we empirically analyze the ability of the concen-
trated liquidity CFMM utilized by Uniswap V3 to handle such un-
expected price shocks and find that Uniswap V3 markets were not
able to adjust to the dramatic price drops of UST and USDT in early
May 2022. We further conclude that the lack of sophistication and
agility of Uniswap V3 liquidity providers is largely responsible for
the market’s price inaccuracies. Additionally, we find that once the
supposedly stable price of a pair turns volatile, there is a lack of
incentives for liquidity providers to create positions that would
facilitate trading at the current price, given the significant risk.

2 RELATED WORK
Limit order books dominate market making in traditional markets.
Market making is largely in the hands of professional market mak-
ers, i.e., specialized firms. The professionals are tasked to ensure
the accuracy of the price, and their ability to do so determines their
own financial success. The high latency and transaction cost on the
blockchain explain why CFMMs, thanks to their simplicity, have
generally been used for market making. Yet, the recent introduc-
tion of concentrated liquidity CFMMs has brought market making
on the blockchain closer to traditional market making as liquidity
providers must select a price range. We study the price accuracy of
concentrated liquidity CFMMs when prices swing unexpectedly.

Angeris et al. [12] were the first to formally study CPMMs and
show that these markets must closely follow the price of the ref-

erence market. In subsequent work, Angeris et al. [11] extend the
analysis to more general CFMMs. In contrast to their work, we em-
pirically investigate the ability of Uniswap V3, an updated CFMM
protocol, to track the price of the reference market.

Chitra et al. [16] compare on-chain CFMMs to conventional limit
order books during periods of liveness loss. They find that both
order books and concentrated liquidity CFMMs perform worse than
unbounded CFMMs under loss of liveness. As opposed to studying
concentrated liquidity CFMMs under liveness loss, we analyze their
ability to track the price of the primary market during unexpected
stablecoin price shocks.

Berg et al. [14] study the presence of market inefficiencies on
Uniswap V2 by searching for and identifying cyclic arbitrage oppor-
tunities; indicative of price inaccuracies in the market. In our work,
we measure price inaccuracies of Uniswap V3 by comparing the
market’s price to that of the primary market. Our analysis focuses
on a time characterized by stablecoin price shocks.

Recently, several studies have emerged [18–21] that focus on
the novel CFMM design pioneered by Uniswap V3. These studies
generally focus on performance and strategies for Uniswap V3
liquidity providers. On the other hand, we present the first empirical
study on the ability of markets utilizing the concentrated liquidity
model to track the price of the primary market.

3 CONSTANT FUNCTION MARKET MAKER
In CFMMS, trades execute automatically, and a predefined invariant
controls the cryptocurrency prices. CFMMs aggregate the liquidity
from many individual liquidity providers in liquidity pools, that are,
smart contracts on the blockchain. Liquidity pools are created for
each tradeable group of cryptocurrencies. Some DEXes restrict the

(c) collection of Uniswap V3 liquidity positions
Figure 2: Visualization of liquidity allocation in (concen-
trated liquidity) CPMMs. While a liquidity position’s liquid-
ity is distributed uniformly on Uniswap V2 (cf. Figure 2a),
each Uniswap V3 liquidity position specifies a price inter-
val [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ] to distribute liquidity across (cf. Figure 2b). The
liquidity distribution of a collection of positions across the
price range on Uniswap V3 is non-uniform (cf. Figure 2c).

number of cryptocurrencies in a liquidity pool to two, while others
allow for liquidity pools with varying numbers of tokens.

3.1 Constant Product Market Maker
The most widely adopted subclass of the CFMM is the CPMM.
Uniswap V3, its predecessors Uniswap V1 and V2 [9] as well as
SushiSwap [5] functions as a CPMM. A CPMM ensures the product
between the pool’s reserves remains constant during trading. The
state of a liquidity pool with two cryptocurrencies, thus, moves
along the red price curve shown in Figure 1.

Consider a liquidity pool 𝑋 − 𝑌 for 𝑋 -tokens and 𝑌 -tokens that
holds 𝑥 𝑋 -tokens and 𝑦 𝑌 -tokens. The pool’s marginal price is then
√𝑥 · 𝑦 [9]. Note that
given by 𝑃 = 𝑦/𝑥 and the pool’s liquidity is 𝐿 =
in the original CPMM design, liquidity is unbounded, i.e., it supports
trading on the pool’s entire price range (0, ∞) (cf. Figure 2a).

Adams et al. [10] pioneered an overhauled CPMM design with
Uniswap V3: a concentrated liquidity CPMM. A liquidity provider
concentrates their liquidity in their chosen price range [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ], see
Figure 2b for a sample liquidity position. Importantly, each liquidity
position only facilitates trading in the specified price range [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ]
and the liquidity provider only collects fees if trading occurs within
this range. Therefore, liquidity providers intend to select their range
around a price they view as a realistic future market price. The
aggregation of the set of individual liquidity positions of the pool
then gives the liquidity distribution of the pool across the entire
price range (cf. Figure 2c).

To describe the pool’s behavior on a price interval [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ] with
constant liquidity, Uniswap V3 utilizes the concept of virtual re-
serves. Virtual reserves simulate trading on the price interval as if
the liquidity distribution on the entire price range (0, ∞) is constant
(cf. Figure 2a) and matches that of the interval [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ]. The virtual
reserves behave according to the constant product price curve, as
shown in Figure 1. Thus, the protocol ensures that the product of
the virtual reserves 𝑥 and 𝑦 stays constant, i.e., 𝑥 · 𝑦 = 𝐿2. Here, 𝐿 is

Exploring Price Accuracy on Uniswap V3 in Times of Distress

the liquidity reserved on the price interval [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ] and the pool’s
marginal price is given by 𝑃 = 𝑦/𝑥 [10]. The following relationship
then holds between virtual reserves, real reserves, and liquidity:
√
𝑃 − 𝐿√︁𝑃𝑙 .

𝑥real = 𝑥 −

We emphasize that the liquidity on the price interval [𝑃𝑙 , 𝑃𝑢 ] must
only support trading within its price boundaries. The real reserves
for the 𝑋 token are fully depleted at the upper price limit 𝑃𝑢 (cf.
Figure 2b). The same holds for 𝑌 -tokens at the lower price boundary.
Note that most CPMMs charge a percentage fee 𝑓 on the trade
input. While all Uniswap V2 pools have the same percentage fee
(0.3%), each Uniswap V3 pool has a predefined percentage fee from
the following set: {0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, 1%}.

3.2 Curve Constant Function Market Maker
Curve is a DEX that uses a unique CFMM that is supposed to be
better suited for stablecoin pairs as the price curve is flatter near
the peg but steeper further away compared to Uniswap V2 [17] (cf.
Figure 1). However, as with Uniswap V2, liquidity is distributed
across the entire price range, so we expect a qualitatively similar
behavior in the event of price turbulences.

4 DATA COLLECTION
We analyze price data between various stablecoin pairs between 7
May and 12 May 2022. In particular, our analysis focuses on two
stablecoins: UST and USDT. The price of the UST began to falter
on 7 May and fell to 30 cents by 11 May. UST never fully recovered
from the price drop and currently trades at a couple of cents. On 12
May, the price of USDT, the biggest stablecoin in terms of market
capitalization, also dramatically dropped and landed 6% below its 1
US$ peg. The price, however, recovered, and USDT has since been
trading only slightly below its peg.

To analyze the impact of these unexpected price drops on the
concentrated liquidity model introduced by Uniswap V3, we com-
pare the price curve of stablecoin pairs, including UST or USDT,
to that of Uniswap V2, Curve, and Binance. We analyze all stable-
coin pairs between UST, USDT, and USDC with significant liquidity.
USDC’s price was stable in mid-May and is, therefore, used as a
price reference for the other two stablecoins.

On Uniswap V3 we consider the following pools: USDT-USDC
(𝑓 = {0.01%, 0.05%}), UST-USDC (𝑓 = {0.01%, 0.05%}), and UST-
USDT (𝑓 = 0.05%). These include all pools between the three ana-
lyzed cryptocurrencies that had more than 30’000 US$ liquidity on 6
May 2022. We include a pair’s price from Uniswap V2 if a pool with
more than 30’000 US$ liquidity exists. Curve price data is inferred
from the 3pool liquidity pool, the biggest stablecoin pool on Curve
that trades USDC, USDT, and DAI, as well as the ust liquidity pool,
which trades UST, USDC, USDT, and DAI. For Binance, we collect
the price data for UST-USDT and USDC-USDT, from which we infer
UST-USDC price data. Binance is by far the leading cryptocurrency
market in terms of volume [7], and thus we will consider its price
the most reliable for the cryptocurrencies that are traded thereon.
We launch an Erigon [2] client to collect data from the Ethereum
blockchain between block 14’726’564 (first block of 7 May) and
block 14’764’083 (last block of 12 May). In particular, we filter event
logs for all events related to Uniswap V2 and V3 as well as Curve.

Price data from Binance is obtained from their market data API [3]
and downloading trade data for the relevant trading pairs.

5 ANALYSIS
We begin the analysis by studying the price of various stable-
coin pools on Uniswap V3 and comparing them with the price
on Binance, which we consider to be the most accurate, as well as
Uniswap V2 and Curve. In Figure 3, we plot these price curves for
four of the five Uniswap V3 pools we analyze. Note that we only
plot the price curve for the UST-USDC pool with the smaller fee
tier as the behavior of the other UST-USDC pool is very similar.

We immediately notice that the price between the pool’s two
assets is less likely to move for the analyzed Uniswap V3 pairs
than the price on Uniswap V2, Curve, or Binance. For instance, we
plot the price of UST in terms of USDC in Figure 3a and USDT
in Figure 3b. We observe that UST’s price on Uniswap V3 never
falls significantly below its peg of 1 US$. On Binance, however,
the price of UST dropped from its peg to around 0.30 cents in the
same time frame. The price on Curve (cf. Figure 3b) tracks the price
on Binance closely, as opposed to Uniswap V3’s price. It appears
that there was no significant liquidity available for the Uniswap V3
stablecoin pools that held UST as one of their assets to continue to
facilitate trading. Considering the very significant and unexpected
price drop of UST, it would not be uncommon for financial markets
to eventually stop trading the assets given such events. Binance, for
instance, stopped trading UST on 13 May as a consequence of the
dramatic price drop [4]. When looking at Uniswap V3, however, we
find that it could not even follow the initial smaller price fluctuations
on 9 May.

The picture becomes even more startling when we study the price
curves of the two Uniswap V3 pools trading USDT and USDC (cf.
Figures 3c and 3d). USDT experienced an abrupt but less significant
price drop than UST on 11 and 12 May, from which it has since
largely recovered. When analyzing Figures 3c and 3d, we observe
that while Uniswap V3 struggles significantly to follow these small
but unexpected price fluctuations, Curve and Uniswap V2 can easily
keep up. In the USDT-USDC (𝑓 = 0.01%) pool, the price of Uniswap
V3 appears to react only after 36 hours. By then, the price of USDT
had already recovered significantly. However, the price of USDT
in the Uniswap V3 pool still experienced a sudden and short price
drop on 12 May at 18:00. Two similar price drops occurred on
Binance a day earlier and in all three cases could be caused by low
liquidity levels. The USDT-USDC (𝑓 = 0.05%) pool reacted much
more quickly to the USDT price drop. However, the liquidity pool
appears to overreact, i.e., experience sudden price drops repeatedly.
The USDT price drops significantly below the price observed in the
other three markets a couple of dozen times.

To better understand the failure of Uniswap V3 to react to UST
and USDT price fluctuations, as well as sudden price drops, we
visualize the liquidity distribution over time in the four Uniswap
V3 pools (cf. Figure 4). We notice that, as expected, the vast majority
of the liquidity is distributed around the equal price of the pool’s
assets in our four pools. In the two liquidity pools that hold UST
as one of their assets (cf. Figures 4a and 4b), the relative liquidity
distribution changes only very slightly over time. On 12 May, when
the price of UST had not been near its peg for a couple of days, the

(c) USDT-USDC (f = 0.01%)

(d) USDT-USDC (f = 0.05%)

Figure 3: We plot the price between various stablecoin pairs on Uniswap V3, Uniswap V2 (where applicable), Curve, and Bi-
nance. Figures 3a and 3b show the price of UST in terms of USDC and UST, respectively, in the Uniswap V3 pools along with
the price curves from Curve and Binance. In Figures 3c and 3d we plot the price of USDT in terms of USDC for the Uniswap V3
pool with fees 0.01% and 0.05% respectively. The corresponding price curves for Uniswap V2, Curve, and Binance are included.

pool’s liquidity was still concentrated around the peg. In fact, by
the end of 12 May, more than 99% of liquidity was still on the price
interval [0.99, 1.01] in both of the UST liquidity pools shown. Thus,
it appears that liquidity providers are not adjusting their positions
quickly enough, which explains why the pool’s price did not track
the primary market’s price.

In Figures 4c and 4d, we visualize the liquidity distribution in
the two USDT-USDC Uniswap V3 pools and again notice that there
are little to no changes in the liquidity distribution despite the price
drop of USDT. Liquidity was not concentrated around the price but
around USDT’s intended peg. Thus, when the price moves outside
the small interval around the equal price of the two stablecoins,
there is little liquidity to support trading – illustrating why the
frequent sharp price drops in the Uniswap V3 pools were possible.
While the previous analysis outlined that the liquidity distribu-
tion across the price interval only saw very few adjustments in
the face of dramatic price drops, even after a few days, we analyze
whether and how quickly liquidity was removed from the Uniswap

V3 stablecoin pools that held UST as one of their assets in Figure 5.
In Figures 5a, 5b and 5c we visualize the liquidity levels in three
Uniswap V3 pools: UST-USDC (f =0.01%), UST-USDC (f =0.05%)
and UST-USDT (f =0.05%). Note that we plot both the value of the
liquidity when it was deposited (in green) and the current value of
the liquidity (in red) in US$ for each timestamp. The current value
of the liquidity accounts for UST’s price drop. In all three pools,
we observe that only a couple but significant liquidity providers
remove their position from the liquidity pools before UST plummets
below 0.95 cents on 9 May (cf. Figure 3). This is especially apparent
in the UST-USDC (f =0.05%) pool, which we show in Figure 5b.
Three large positions with an average value of 1M US$, accounting
for three-fourths of the pool’s liquidity, are removed from the pool
by midday on 9 May. From that point on, we see the difference be-
tween the value deposited and current begin to divide significantly,
i.e., the liquidity providers in the pool start to experience significant
losses. We further note that the liquidity providers were no longer
earning fees, as the pools had stopped trading (cf. Figure 3). Observe

(b) UST-USDT (f = 0.05%)

(c) USDT-USDC (f = 0.01%)

(d) USDT-USDC (f = 0.05%)

Figure 4: We visualize the liquidity distribution on the price interval over time and include the price curve of the primary
market (Binance) as a reference. The depth of liquidity in the price interval is visualized by the intensity of the shaded area;
darker price intervals hold more liquidity than lighter price intervals at the same time. Liquidity is represented relatively at
a point in time. Observe that the Binance price exits the price range for which trading is possible on Uniswap V3.

that even by the end of 12 May, by that time UST had not been
trading near its peg for several days, more than half of the pool’s
liquidity positions were still active (cf. Figure 5d). We conclude that
the small number of liquidity providers in the three pools did not
adapt to the changes in the price of the pool’s assets quickly enough
to ensure that trading could continue or even to remove their assets
from the pool in time to avoid significant financial losses.

6 DISCUSSION
Uniswap V3 does not appear equipped to handle volatile cryptocur-
rency markets. Its Achilles heel partially lies in its reliance on liq-
uidity providers to react to market changes. While market making
has long been handled by a few professional market makers in tra-
ditional finance, we observed that Uniswap V3 liquidity providers
as a whole currently lack the sophistication and agility required
for complex market making. The liquidity providers’ apparent in-
experience calls into question the suitability of the concentrated
liquidity CPMM for DeFi. Not only did we observe that Uniswap
V3 could not track the price of the primary market, but also saw
that both its predecessor and Curve were fit for the task. While
Uniswap V2 does not offer the same capital efficiency that Uniswap

V3 for stablecoin pairs that continuously trade at an equal price,
Curve’s price curve can also reach high levels of capital efficiency
around the equal price.

Providing liquidity bears the risk of seeing the value of the liq-
uidity position decrease compared to the initial assets deposited.
This phenomenon is known as impermanent loss and is particularly
pronounced for high price volatility [19]. Given the speed of such
an abrupt price drop and the general risk-off market sentiment that
prevails in such a crisis, liquidity providers may be reluctant to
open new liquidity positions.

Furthermore, note that pairs deemed to have a stable price,
namely stablecoin pairs, generally have all liquidity in pools with a
small percentage fee. Thus, once the price of a supposedly stable
cryptocurrency pair becomes volatile, there are too few incentives
for liquidity providers to create new liquidity positions. As a pool’s
fee cannot be adjusted, the meager fees liquidity providers expect
to receive in the pools do not compensate them for the risk they
face given the elevated volatility. Therefore, before supplying liq-
uidity, they might choose to create a new liquidity pool. In fact,
new pools that hold UST with high fees were launched after the
price drop, such as the UST-USDC (𝑓 = 1%) pool. However, the pool

(d) number of unique active liquidity positions

Figure 5: We visualize the liquidity levels over time in three Uniswap V3 pools: UST-USDC (f =0.01%) (cf. Figure 5a), UST-USDC
(f =0.05%) (cf. Figure 5b) and UST-USDT (f =0.05%) (cf. Figure 5c). We plot both the original and current US$ value of the liquidity
that remains in the pool. Note that a pool’s liquidity does not match the total value locked in the pool, as a consequence of the
collected fees not acting as liquidity. In Figure 5d we further plot the number of active liquidity positions in the three pools
over time. Notice that the number of unique liquidity positions is small and does not even half during UST price decline.

was only created on 12 May, days after UST had lost its peg and
never acquired the same levels of liquidity as the existing pools
with lower fees. Thus, liquidity was further diluted across several
pools, which reduces capital efficiency.

Given this unfavorable risk-reward ratio for liquidity providers
to deposit liquidity around the new price during times of market
distress, DEXes could compensate liquidity providers for taking
on this risk. In fact, liquidity providing on Uniswap V3 has been
shown to exhibit similarities with financial derivatives [19]. Thus,
just as option prices rise with volatility [15], protocols could adopt
a fee structure that would increase with volatility. Such behavior
also occurs in traditional financial markets. During times of mar-
ket upheaval the bid-ask spread increases as market makers, who
generate their profit from this spread, seek compensation for the
risks arising due to the rapid price changes [8].

Finally, we also want to emphasize that the relative importance
we should place on capital efficiency, in comparison to price ac-
curacy, is unclear. The security implications of price inaccuracies

and low levels of liquidity outside a small price interval around the
equal price could allow for an inexpensive attack geometric mean
time-weighted average price (TWAP) on Uniswap V3 [13]. During
such an attack, the attacker profits from manipulating Uniswap
V3’s spot price for the duration of a block. Not only do we already
observe repeated price drops in the USDT-USDC (f = 0.05%) pool,
but we also found that in the UST pool, very little liquidity was
outside the price interval [0.99,1.01] around the equal price at the
end of 12 May. To give an example, on May 12 a single transaction
exchanged 999’242 USDT for 995’221 USDC in the USDT-USDC
(f = 0.01%) pool. Thus, the trade executed at the price of 0.9959
(USDC/USDT). In the process, the trade moved the pool’s price
from 0.9993 to 0.4999. At the same time, the price on Binance was
0.9966, and we see that the trade almost executed at market price but
created a huge price inaccuracy as it entered regions on the price
interval with little liquidity. Thus, it was relatively inexpensive for
an attacker to move the price.

7 CONCLUSION
Our empirical analysis finds that the concentrated liquidity CPMM
pioneered by Uniswap V3 is currently not ready to handle un-
expected price drops. Not only did we observe significant price
inaccuracies and financial loss on the liquidity provider side, but
we also see the potential for TWAP attacks on Uniswap V3 oracles.
For the success of Uniswap V3, it is thus imperative that liquidity
providers will become more sophisticated and agile.
