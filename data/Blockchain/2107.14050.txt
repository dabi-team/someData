ABSTRACT 
Evidence destruction and tempering is a time-tested tactic to protect 
the  powerful  perpetrators,  criminals,  and  corrupt  officials.  Coun- 
tries where law enforcing institutions and judicial system can be 
comprised, and evidence destroyed or tampered, ordinary citizens 
feel disengaged with the investigation or prosecution process, and 
in some instances, intimidated due to the vulnerability to exposure 
and  retribution.  Using  Distributed  Ledger  Technologies  (DLT),  such 
as blockchain, as the underpinning technology, here we propose a 
conceptual model – ‘EvidenceChain’, through which citizens can 
anonymously  upload  digital  evidence,  having  assurance  that  the 
integrity of the evidence will be preserved in an immutable and inde- 
structible manner. Person uploading the evidence can anonymously 
share it with investigating authorities or openly  with public, if co- 
erced by the perpetrators or authorities. Transferring the ownership 
of  evidence  from  authority  to  ordinary  citizen,  and  custodianship  of 
evidence  from  susceptible  centralized  repository  to  an  immutable 
and  indestructible  distributed  repository,  can  cause  a  paradigm  shift 
of power that not only can minimize spoliation of evidence but 
human rights abuse too.  Here the conceptual  model  was  theoreti- 
cally  tested  against  some  high-profile  spoliation  of  evidence  cases 
from four South Asian developing countries that often rank high 
in global corruption index and low in human rights index.

1  INTRODUCTION 
Spoliation of evidence refers to altering, destruction, tampering, fab- 
ricating or withholding evidence relevant to a legal proceeding [1]. 
It is also known that spoliation of evidence is a common phenome- 
non across the globe to protect the perpetrators, corrupt officials 
and  politicians  [2-7]  For  many  developing  countries  spoliation  of 
evidence is purposefully done to cover up corruption or to protect 
powerful  individuals.  Since  the  judicial  system  in  these  countries 
is predominantly paper base, fire is usually used to destroy criti- 
cal evidence, along with wide range of techniques to tamper and 
fabricate documents [8]. Furthermore, bribery and intimidation are 
commonly used to withhold evidence [8]. Paper based evidence 
archived in a central repository under the custodianship of a central 
authority are thought to be the main vulnerable points of spoliation 
of evidence, since in most of the spoliation cases, these repositories 
or authorities were targeted. 

With growing accessibility of smart phones in developing coun- 
tries, ordinary citizens are becoming well versed to capture critical 
evidence. This is evident from the growing trend of using digital 
evidence (photos, emails, audio-video recordings etc.) in investi- 
gations and court proceedings. However, several outdated laws 
and regulations may consider these digital trails of events to be 
inadmissible in the court of law, i.e. laws requiring first-hand wit- 
ness to provide evidence [9]. It is not hard to imagine that with 
the growing number of trades, transactions, and communication 
in virtual world, paper-based evidence can soon be replaced by 
digital evidence. For example, a viral video on social media may 
be a reason for the authorities to take action and provision of jus- 
tice. However, despite this imminent and inevitable transformation, 
spoliation of evidence will continue or may increase with digital 
evidence  in  near  future  unless  the  central  aspect  of  archiving  and 
administration  is  changed.  Furthermore,  this  transformation  will 
require the legislative bodies to update the laws and make room 
for the new dimension of evidence collection and submission. 

Addressing this paradox, this paper proposes  EvidenceChain, 
a hybrid blockchain model to protect vital evidence from spoli- 
ation. Using Ethereum [10] blockchain network, which has over 
25K nodes across the globe and a peer-to-peer distributed file sys- 
tem, IPFS [11], this conceptual model aims to facilitate evidence 
collection from  general public  while preserving their  privacy,  and 
secure archiving of evidence in a distributed, synchronized and 
temper  evident  manner.  In  the  proposed  model,  ordinary  citizens 
can upload evidence without compromising their privacy, using 
anonymous  communication facilities  of  web services  like  Tor [12]. 
The submitted evidence is then protected from any malicious tem- 
pering  attempts  using  the  cryptographic  features  and  distributed

nature of blockchain technology. Bypassing authorities to produce 
evidence will facilitate confidence in public and enhance the us- 
ability of the system, which in the long run will encourage citizens 
to come forward with vital evidence, who otherwise would feel 
vulnerable.  Distributed  aspect  of  the  blockchain  which  made  it  inde- 
structible against single point of attack or compromise, will provide 
security, and immutability aspect will protect against tampering or 
fabrication. 

From the authorities perspective the model will use private- 
permissioned blockchain network [13] which can be accessed only 
by authorized personnel. This private blockchain will be linked 
with public blockchain as a tiered architecture model, allowing 
users  to  communicate  selectively.  Through  this  hybrid  blockchain 
interface, evidence related to the  investigation  will be  made  avail- 
able to the authorities for authenticity and relevancy assessment 
purpose. Upon validation, the evidence will be classified as authen- 
tic and preserved using decentralized storage system (IPFS) and 
the proof of integrity of the evidence will be preserved on the im- 
mutable  blockchain.  Consensus  based  vetting  in  the  private  tier  will 
safeguard against any kind of biasness from authority side while 
simultaneously facilitate to filter out false evidence submitted by 
the general public. 

In order to illustrate  why and  how such model can be  used 
in South Asian context, this paper outline the breadth and depth 
of spoliation of evidence in South Asian countries in section 2. 
Blockchain and smart contract technologies are described in section 
3, following with examples of related work in section 4 and the 
details of EvidenceChain in section 5. The proposed model is then 
evaluated  in  section  6  and  limitations  and  future  work  are  discussed 
in section 7 and 8, respectively. The paper  finally concludes in 
section 9. 

2  SPOLIATION  OF  EVIDENCE IN  SOUTH  ASIA 
In South Asian countries, where most of the evidences are still paper 
and  physical  witness  based,  different  types  of  spoliation  of  evidence 
occur. Examples of some high-profile spoliation of evidence are 
listed below under three major types of spoliation of evidence. 

2.1  Destruction  of  Evidence 
Fire is the most common form of evidence spoliation tactics in 
South Asian countries. In 2004, during the investigation of collu- 
sion  between  land  mafia  and  authorities,  fire  broke  out  at  Lahore 
Development Authority (LDA) and number of files associated to 
that case related plots of land went missing [14]. Similar incident 
also occurred during 2013 but this time eight lives were also lost, 
along  with  files  containing  information  worth  of  PKRs  1.5  trillion 
(approximately USD 9.27 billion) [15]. In 2018 fire broke out in In- 
come Tax Department office in Mumbai, India during the Rs 14,000 
crore banking fraud case, allegedly committed by absconding jew- 
eler Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi during 2011-2017 
period [16]. In 2019, Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution 
(BSTI), a government authority, itself destroyed all the evidence 
relating  to  the  prosecution  of  61  companies  accused  of  marketing 
73 uneatable packaged food items and deliberately framed innocent 
individuals [17]. 

2.2  Tampering/Fabrication  of  Evidence 
In a recent incident in Sri Lanka, phone call recordings of MP Ran- 
jan Ramanayake were leaked online [18] as an evidence of collusion 
between  Mr.  Ranjan  and  high  profile  government  officials  including 
high court judges with regard to alleged corruption cases. However, 
some of these conversations available on social media seems to be 
fabricated, which caused doubt about the previously leaked conver- 
sations among the general public [19]. The joint investigation team 
(JIT) probing the killing of four people by the Counter-Terrorism 
Department  (CTD)  personnel  in  an  alleged  encounter  in  Sahiwal, 
Pakistan,  in  2019,  found  evidence  of  tampering  within  the  digital 
records by the higher-ups authorities [20]. In another incident of ev- 
idence  tampering,  investigating  officials  for  the  assassination  case 
of former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, found that 
police personnel had tampered with the case records [21]. Authori- 
ties  of  Bangladesh  government  systematically  tamper  or  fabricate 
phone conversation and release it to social media with fake IDs, in 
order to frame or harass political opponents [22] 

2.3  Withholding  of  Evidence 
In  2016  governor  of  Bangladesh  Bank  (the  central  bank  of 
Bangladesh) concealed what happened to be the largest bank heist 
anywhere in the world. Hackers managed to get into the SWIFT 
terminal computers of Bangladesh Bank and transferred around 
$1 billion from Bangladesh Bank’s account with United States Fed- 
eral Reserve to private accounts  in Philippines  and Sri Lanka [23]. 
When reported to the governor Dr. Atiur Rahman, instead of in- 
forming it to the authority and public, withheld information about 
the incident for about a month, until news about the incident ap- 
peared in Philippines’ newspapers. Although external investigators 
(FBI, NSA) reported evidence of hackers from North Korea [24], 
internal report from Bangladesh government was never published 
because according to then finance minister of Bangladesh Abul 
Mal  Muhit  “influential names  are on the  report”  [24]. In Pakistan, 
the  JIT  investigating  Panama  papers  case  declared  that  important 
documents regarding the source of income and money trail were 
withheld  by  the  family  of  then  prime  minister,  Mian  Muhammad 
Nawaz  Shareef  [25].  The  Federal  Investigation  Authority  (FIA)  of 
Pakistan  reportedly  face  severe  pressure  to  withhold  information 
related to investigations against high profile cases [26]. Table 1 sum- 
marize few  of  these high profile cases  from  South  Asian  countries 
regarding evidence spoliation. 

3  BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACT 
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), commonly known as 
blockchain,  have  demonstrable  potential  to  prevent  spoliation  of 
evidence.  Introduced  just  after  the  2008  global  financial  crisis, 
blockchain  is  the  underpinning  technology  of  cryptocurrency  Bit- 
coin  [37].  Blockchain  basically  is  an  append-only,  temper-evident, 
globally distributed digital ledger or database system where up- 
dated copy of the ledger is  available to all stakeholders at all time 
and thereby provides transparency. Blockchain is also a “trustless” 
system where instead of trusted third party or intermediaries (e.g. 
banks, government organizations, corporations), trust on each trans- 
action  is  validated  by  general  consensus  of  the  stakeholders  through 
different consensus protocols [38]. Once validated, transaction is

recorded  on  the  ledger  in  an  immutable  fashion  and  the  updated 
copy of the ledger is available to all stakeholders. Distributed and 
real time storage of consensus derived validated data, not only 
safeguard data from hacking but also tampering. Cryptographic 
capability of blockchain ensures privacy of the data producer. 

Recent years also witnessed the advent of smart contracts which 
are basically agreements written in computer codes. Instead of de- 
pending on third parties like solicitors to execute an agreement, 
smart contract automatically executes the agreed actions (e.g. pay- 
ment) upon completion of a validated and recorded transaction on 
corresponding blockchain. Smart contract also enables data pro- 
ducer to take ownership of their data by implementing data sharing 
policies with data consumers [39]. For example, whom to share the 
data with, which part(s) of the data set and for how long. 

4  RELATED WORK 
Governments  and  academics  have  been  actively  exploring 
blockchain technology as a “source of truth” due to its intrinsic prop- 
erties of provenance, persistence, auditability, traceability, trans- 
parency and immutability [40]. The state of Vermont of USA has leg- 
islated the blockchain based evidence submission [41]. The supreme 

people’s  court  of  China  have  embraced  blockchain  technology  to 
tackle challenges in collection, preservation and authentication 
of  evidence  in  the  internet  courts  [42].  Her  Majesty  Court  and 
Tribunals (HMCTS) of UK have been investigating the feasibility 
of  using  DLTs for securing  digital evidence  and  evidence  sharing 
with other law enforcement agencies [43]. Spring [9] argued that 
blockchain  evidence  is  mostly  inadmissible  in  the  current  Federal 
Rules of Evidence (FRE), even though it should be admissible in 
most cases, therefore urges Congress to consider amendments in 
FRE so that the “extraordinarily reliable” blockchain evidence is 
admissible. 

Zhihong et al. [44] proposed a private blockchain system utiliz- 
ing multi-signature solution for evidence submission and retrieval. 
The  proposed  solution  named  “Block-DEF”  partially  satisfies  the 
traceability of evidence and treats evidence as a confidential docu- 
ment. However, since the system requires user to submit evidence 
to a private network, it does not guarantee the security or fairness 
of the system. Bonomi et al. [45] proposed a blockchain based chain 
of custody (BCOC) to ensure the traceability and integrity of the 
evidence and guaranteeing the state of evidence during the inves- 
tigation. BCOC for the integrity and tamper resistance of digital

forensics chain of custody has also been proposed by Lone and Mir 
[46], and Brotis et al.[47] propose a blockchain based solution for 
collection and preservation of forensic evidence in smart homes, 
using a permissioned blockchain. Jung et al. [48] proposed a frame- 
work for communication of Internet of Things (IoT) devices on 
public blockchain, in order to preserve the integrity of data and 
enhanced security, aiding transparent investigation [48]. 

Dimaz and Dony [49] highlighted a challenge in tax fraud inves- 
tigation which relies on two copies of a letter as a proof of digital 
forensic acquisition. Either of the parties (taxpayer or tax inves- 
tigator) can tamper with the letter, challenging the authenticity 
of the letter held by the counterparty. Case study conducted by 
Dimaz and Dony, demonstrates the usage of Bitcoin blockchain as 
a  solution to prevent evidence tampering that  may have  occurred 
during a tax fraud investigation. Bela et al. [50] propose the usage 
of blockchain technology as a solution to guarantee the integrity 
of dashboard video footage so that it can be utilized as an evi- 
dence in court. Mingda et al. [51] proposed recording the hash of 
the campus  surveillance  video  on to the “proof  of  stake”  protocol 
based ‘videochain’ blockchain to ensure the credibility of the video 
evidence. 

Most of the work done focuses on logging information on the 
blockchain for evidential purposes but to the best of our knowl- 
edge, no complete framework for evidence collection from whistle 
blowers/general public utilizing blockchain technology have yet 
been proposed. We explore not only the technical abilities of using 
a blockchain based solution for the protection of evidence spoilage 
but  also  give  considerable  attention  to  the  privacy  factor  for  both 
the evidence and evidence provider. 

5  EVIDENCECHAIN: A PUBLIC-PRIVATE 

HYBRID BLOCKCHAIN MODEL 

Any technical solution for preventing spoliation of  evidence must 
meet the following conditions: 

• 

• 

• 

Usability - Anyone should be able to come forward and 
provide evidence. 
Privacy - Evidence provider should be able to do so anony- 
mously, since it is not only the evidence, but the evidence 
provider who also must be protected. 
Security  –  Guarantee that the evidence  cannot be  modified 
maliciously  after  submission  and  one  could  prove  that  the 
evidence in question is same as the one submitted by the 
evidence provider. 

The proposed solution should permit members of public to pro- 
vide evidence of public interest securely and anonymously, whilst 
simultaneously  allowing  the  pertinent  public  authorities  to  utilize 
the system with escalated privileges. Therefore, we adopt a public- 
private hybrid blockchain model which allows to setup a consumer 
facing  public  blockchain  (allowing  everyone  to  participate)  and  a 
permissioned  distributed  ledger  for  legal  cooperation  and  investi- 
gation proceedings within the authorities. We propose utilizing (a) 
a  Tor  [52]  website  for  evidence  provider’s  privacy,  (b)  distributed 
storage to avoid creating data honeypots which can be tampered 
or destroyed easily, (c) a public blockchain network to guarantee 
the open access, immutability and auditability of the evidence and 

(d) a private distributed ledger for secure collaboration among au- 
thorities and vetting of evidence. Architecturally, the model can be 
divided into three layers, (L1)  application layer hosting the website, 
ensuring  end  user  privacy  and  sanction  resistant  access,  (L2)  stor- 
age layer storing large evidence files in a distributed fashion, and 
(L3) executive layer with a hybrid distributed ledger structure to 
guarantee  evidence  immutability  and  secure  data  sharing  within 
the investigating authorities. 

5.1  Protecting privacy of evidence provider 
Essentially, there can be two user groups within the system. 1) 
anonymous  whistle blowers  who would like to  bring  evidence to 
the light, 2) case workers and collaborators who wish to securely 
preserve the evidence. For user group 1, we take a privacy by default 
approach and propose using a Tor [52] website as the front-end 
for evidence submission in order to safeguard their identity and 
privacy. Tor is an anonymity network based on the onion routing 
introduced by Reed et al. [53]. It transmits data from source to 
destination using randomly selected route of nodes (a physical end 
device capable of receiving, sending, and forwarding information), 
utilizing  asymmetric  cryptography.  The  National  Security  Agency 
(NSA) termed Tor as “the King of highly secure, low latency Internet 
anonymity”  [54].  Tor  has  become  the  de-facto communication  soft- 
ware  of  choice  in  places  where  communication  is  monitored,  and 
free speech is prohibited [52]. Investigative newspapers like The 
Guardian  use  Tor  for  secure  drop  service  [55]  and  security  expert 
like Edward Snowden who along with The Guardian journalists 
exposed the US National Security Agency (NSA) about their illegal 
global surveillance activities, thinks “Tor is the most important 
privacy-enhancing technology project being used today” [56] 

Tor  interface  will  allow  evidence  providers  to  submit  evidence 
using  average  computers  but  leaving  no  digital  footprint,  having 
the  confidence  that  the  information  or  their  identity  cannot  be 
compromised, and they cannot be traced or identified. Recent devel- 
opments like Brave web browser have made access to Tor network 
very easy. With its 5 million daily active users, Brave can allow 
users to easily connect to Tor network without being isolated easily 
[57]. Privacy of the user can be further enhanced by using virtual 
private networks (VPN) or other anonymization techniques. How- 
ever, the usability of the solution compels us to allow the user to 
upload evidence with minimum efforts. 

In some cases, the evidence may contain privacy-sensitive infor- 
mation and the user may wish to not make it visible to public. The 
application layer would allow for the user to encrypt the evidence 
using the consortium’s public keys on client side, before uploading 
to IPFS. The challenge with evidence encryption is that whistle- 
blower is trusting the consortium to act in all fairness (similar to 
[44]). However, it still gives the whistle blower a  choice to release 
the evidence in public domain if they suspect collusion. 

Group 2 users are usually members of the authorities and there- 
fore can directly access the storage layer and communicate with 
the blockchain layer since they are privileged users who do not 
have  anonymity  concerns.  They  can  store  the  encrypted  evidence 
to the distributed storage, without having to mask their identity 
through Tor website. We recommend using attribute based [58] or

Figure 1: (a) The evidence provider uploads the digital evidence to the secure Tor website (solid lines) which is anonymized 
through Tor network (b). The content of the evidence is written to (c) private IPFS network of legal entities. Upon successful 
storage in IPFS, (d) the content-based hash from IPFS and metadata of the evidence is posted to Ethereum blockchain by 
invoking the evidence protection smart contract (e). Once the transaction has been accepted on the Ethereum blockchain (f) 
the metadata of the transaction/ evidence is posted back to the private distributed ledger, serving as an immutable record of 
the evidence. 

hierarchical [59] encryption schemes for evidence encryption so 
that the evidence is not lost in case of user losing their private keys. 

5.2  Tamper  evident  distributed  storage 
As discussed in the section II, majority of the evidence tampering, 
and destruction occurs while evidence is stored at a centralized 
physical or virtual location. These evidence honeypots become 
the target for attackers to destroy or tamper with the evidence at 
rest. We propose to store the evidence in a private configuration of 
decentralized storage, IPFS [11], for each node in the evidence-chain 
consortium. This makes the evidence destruction a near impossible 
task since the evidence is not hosted at a single server or provider, 
instead  it  is  replicated  and  distributed  among  several  geographically 
distributed,  decentralized  nodes.  Furthermore,  IPFS  addresses  the 
files by content instead of the location, i.e. the cryptographic hash 
of the content becomes the address of the content. This not only 
guarantees the integrity of the evidence, since the cryptographic 
hash of evidence will change if a malicious actor tampers with the 
evidence, it permits to destroy the evidence permanently at the end 
of its life cycle. However, since we are relying on a private IPFS 
network in order to preserve the data privacy and confidentiality, 
the chances of collective tempering are higher as compared to using 
a public IPFS network. 

5.3  Immutability  of  evidence 
Evidence stored in IPFS is mutable and it can be modified. Therefore, 
to preserve the integrity and proof of upload, the IPFS resource lo- 
cator (hash of content) along with its metadata is uploaded to a cen- 
sorship resistant public blockchain like Ethereum, once the content 
is stored in IPFS. Public blockchain will guarantee the immutability 
and integrity of the commitment of evidence for perpetuity. The 
timestamping will also serve as a proof of existence for the evidence. 
Even  though  transacting  on  the  public  blockchain  will  incur  extra 
costs, we believe that it is important for the trustworthiness and 
functioning of the system to be out of control of a single authority 
or a consortium of stakeholders with somewhat similar interests. 
For example, if the consortium collectively deletes or temper the 
evidence from all IPFS nodes, the hash on the Ethereum blockchain 
will point to nothing or will not match with the evidence, con- 
firming that the evidence has been tempered with. However, the 
evidence can still be deleted at the end of its lifecycle. The smart 
contract will require signatures from all parties, confirming that 
they have removed the evidence following the legal proceedings 
such as court orders. 

5.4  Collaboration  and  vetting  of  evidence 
The judicial system works better if everyone can  participate in 
evidence provision, especially if they have faith in the process.

Ali Shahaab et al. 

However, utilizing the evidence in an investigation and using it in 
the court of law requires certain privileges, i.e. everyone cannot 
participate in these procedures.  We propose a  private  consortium 
of authorities to vet the evidence and efficiently collaborate with 
each other on investigations. 

Upon acceptance of the transaction on the public blockchain, 
the metadata of the transaction  along with the metadata of the 
IPFS storage can be made available in the private distributed ledger 
network for verification by the relevant authorities. The authorities 
can collectively accept or reject the evidence on merit and admis- 
sibility. Humanitarian organizations and watchdogs can also be 
invited to the consortium, seeking fairness and transparency in the 
process. Fig. 1 shows a high-level view of the proposed model. 

Fake evidence can be created and submitted as an evidence in or- 
der to sabotage one’s reputation and can severely harm one’s social 
position. Keeping personal data off the blockchain and only posting 
the commitment provides partly address the challenge since it still 
allows  the  user  to  remove  the  underlaying  data.  We  also  recommend 
liking the outcome of the investigation back to the evidence, so 
that observers are aware of the credibility of the evidence (similar 
to deletion of evidence as an outcome of investigation).

Strength of blockchain lies with its unique immutability, trace- 
ability and distributed features. Once information is archived in 
blockchain, the  proof  of  evidence will  remain  for  perpetuity  in  an 
immutable manner. Similar to internet, blockchain network cannot 
be taken down by any authority, let alone powerful individuals. 
No authorities can destroy, obstruct or even edit the content (cryp- 
tographic  proofs  of  evidence)  archived  in  public  blockchain.  This 
censorship  resistant  capability  prevents  evidence  from  attempt  of 
spoliation,  especially  through  destruction  as  exemplified  in  South 
Asian countries context. 

Tampering of documents stored in distributed storage is also not 
possible because any change even a punctuation like semicolon, 
will break the hash that cryptographically represents the document 
on the blockchain. However, if tampered evidence were uploaded 
by member of public or authority itself, as in the cases of Sri Lanka, 
Pakistan  and  Bangladesh,  that  tampered  evidence  will  remain  on 
the network. In such scenario, member of the public or whistle 
blower within the authority in possession of the original/authentic 
evidence can anonymously publish it and make the visibility open 
to all. Depending on the public interest on the evidence, contra- 
dictory evidence  may trigger  public uproar in social  media  which 
may compel authorities to reinvestigate or even nullify the fake or 
tempered evidence, because of the existence of multiple versions of 
the evidence. 

Officials  authenticating fabricated  or tampered evidence  on the 
blockchain will have to think carefully. As the evidence authenti- 
cator, their names and signatures will be associated with the evi- 
dence and it can be retrieved easily using the traceability feature of 
blockchain and can be made publicly visible (like name and shame). 
Any future change of external or internal “power balance” or “mu- 
tual understanding” may jeopardize their career, entitlements, and 
social status, leading to potential prosecutions. However, since ordi- 
nary citizens can upload evidence anonymously, it is expected that 

in  this  model,  many  tampered/fabricated  evidences  will  be  made 
publicly available. Artificial Intelligence will play a  pivotal role in 
this perspective to filter out tampered evidence, but collective intel- 
ligence  and  surveillance  of  ordinary  citizen  will  ultimately  enable 
to filter the right one [60]. 

Timestamping ability of blockchain can resists withholding of 
evidence. In Bangladesh Bank example, when governor of the bank 
instructed his subordinate within the bank to maintain “strict se- 
crecy” just after the incident of heist was discovered, whistle blower 
within the bank could anonymously upload evidence on the Ev- 
idenceChain which would have been automatically timestamped. 
Whistle blower could subjectively give access of the evidence to 
public as when and how much required to demonstrate the level of 
evidence withheld. Evidence associated block timestamp would by 
default provide the length of withholding. 

7  LIMITATIONS 
The rising transaction fees and volatility are a major concern for 
the adaptation of blockchain technology and platforms like Ev- 
idenceChain  which  rely  on  the  utilization  of  public  blockchain. 
The average transaction fee (7 days simple moving average) on 
Ethereum network as of July 2020 is approximately USD 1.85, which 
is 10x increase from one year ago [61]. The transaction fees can 
also spike during the network congestion periods, as seen in the 
2017-2018  cryptocurrencies  boom  (average  transaction  fees  in  the 
range of USD 3 per transaction). Transaction fees have spiked more 
recently to as high as $40 per transaction. One key limitation of 
our proposed model is transaction fee cost, i.e. who incurs the cost 
of  evidence  provision?  A  decentralized  autonomous  organization 
(DAO) funded by the public authorities, NGOs or individuals can 
be setup so that evidence providers can upload evidence for free. 
However, this may lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by vested 
interest groups or funds being consumed by non-vital evidences 
submissions. Therefore, it is comparatively beneficial to have the 
evidence provider pay for the transaction. This will discourage the 
users of the system to submit fabricated or less useful transactions. 
The challenge can be somewhat addressed by linking the evidence 
to the user but we have carefully chosen anonymity over privacy. 
Even though the proposed model intensively focuses on the evi- 
dence provider’s privacy, security of the evidence provider cannot 
be fully guaranteed since the model is expected to be used by the 
public who are not always technology savvy. Onion routing service 
provided by Tor offers end to end encryption and robust security 
but since the domains are hashes of the public keys, they are dif- 
ficult to remember and prone to typing errors, etc. Although the 
model guarantees the integrity of evidence once it has received 
sufficient verifications on the public blockchain, a  malicious  actor 
may temper with the evidence before the upload. Trusting oracles 
for real world data provision is an active area of research [62], 
however, no fully robust alternatives have been conceptualized yet. 
Furthermore, the source can be potentially identified based from the 
access means of evidence or the evidence itself, for example, a video 
footage capturing the evidence provider recording the evidence, 
hence revealing their identity. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Preventing Spoliation of Evidence with Blockchain: A Perspective from South Asia 

ICBCT ’21, March 26–28, 2021, Shanghai, China 

xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" 

8  FUTURE  WORK 
Similar  to  the  vanity  onion  domains  of  Facebook  (<ext- 
link 
ext-link- 
type="facebook"  xlink:href="https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/ 
">facebookcorewwwi.onion</ext-link>)  or  New  York  Times 
(nytimes3xbfgragh.onion),  we  aim  to  generate  onion  addresses  as 
variations of keyword ‘evidence’ to improve on the accessibility of 
an onion websites for evidence protection and increase the identity 
protection for the evidence provider. We also plan to develop a 
working model of the proposed system so that the practical aspects 
can be evaluated. In future, we would revisit the proposed model to 
adapt  for  decentralized  blockchain  domains,  once  the  eco  system 
of decentralized web has evolved in the years to come. 

9  CONCLUSION 
Although the effectiveness of the model to prevent spoliation of 
evidence is  theoretically  and technically  achievable, the  success  of 
the model lies with usability, particularly how simple the experi- 
ence is for the general public to upload evidence to the platform 
anonymously. If users cannot access the platform easily, it will 
hinder the wider usage and effectiveness of the system. If the web 
interface is available via the open web, then it would compromise 
user’s  identity  and  authorities  could  also  monitor  the  platform  to 
target the users. Therefore, a Tor web service-based interface is 
proposed by this model which although has robust capability to 
maintain privacy but in terms of usability, non-technical users may 
find it difficult, especially in contrast to open web interface. Success 
of the model therefore lies  with finding the right balance between 
usability and privacy, a paradox faced by all digital applications 
[63]. 

Transforming  present  centralized,  tamper  and  attack  prone  ev- 
idence management system to a distributed, immutable and in- 
destructible system through EvidenceChain like model will have 
two societal impacts: First, empowering ordinary citizen and whis- 
tle blower with a new paradigm, where they will be able to exert 
their power to prevent spoliation of evidence as well as human 
rights  abuse  by  publishing  evidence  without  the  fear  of  exposure 
and retribution. Second, transforming the vetting process into a 
consensus-based approach will prevent any compromised actor 
within the authorities to manipulate the vetting process. Moreover, 
transparency,  especially  linking  vetted  evidence  with  signatories 
and  preserving  the  integrity  record  immutably  on  public  blockchain, 
will transfer the fear of retribution from ordinary citizen to author- 
ities. In South Asian and other developing countries context, this 
transfer of power from authority to public and fear of retribution 
other  way  round,  may  contribute  to  change  the  post-colonial  age 
mindset, which we believe in long run will not only minimize the 
spoliation of evidence but may maximize the potential to establish 
transparent and just societies.
