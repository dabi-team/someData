Abstract

Block-STM is a parallel execution engine for smart contracts,
built around the principles of Software Transactional Memory.
Transactions are grouped in blocks, and every execution of the block
must yield the same deterministic outcome. Block-STM further en-
forces that the outcome is consistent with executing transactions
according to a preset order, leveraging this order to dynamically
detect dependencies and avoid conflicts during speculative transac-
tion execution. At the core of Block-STM is a novel, low-overhead
collaborative scheduler of execution and validation tasks.

Block-STM is implemented on the main branch of the Diem
Blockchain code-base and runs in production at Aptos. Our evalua-
tion demonstrates that Block-STM is adaptive to workloads with
different conflict rates and utilizes the inherent parallelism therein.
Block-STM achieves up to 110𝑘 tps in the Diem benchmarks and
up to 170𝑘 tps in the Aptos Benchmarks, which is a 20x and 17x
improvement over the sequential baseline with 32 threads, respec-
tively. The throughput on a contended workload is up to 50𝑘 tps
and 80𝑘 tps in Diem and Aptos benchmarks, respectively.

1 Introduction
A central challenge facing emerging decentralized web3 plat-
forms and applications is improving the throughput of the
underlying Blockchain systems. At the core of a Blockchain
system is state machine replication, allowing a set of entities
to agree on and apply a sequence of blocks of transactions.
Each transaction contains smart contract code to be executed,
and every entity that executes the block of transactions must
arrive at the same final state. While there has been progress
on scaling parts of the system, Blockchains are still bottle-
necked by other components, such as transaction execution.
Our goal is to accelerate the in-memory execution of trans-
actions via parallelism. Transactions that access different
memory locations can always be executed in parallel. How-
ever, in a Blockchain system transactions can have significant
number of access conflicts. This may happen due to potential

performance attacks, accessing popular contracts or due to
economic opportunities (such as auctions and arbitrage [16]).
Conflicts are the main challenge for performance. An ap-
proach pioneered by Software Transactional Memory (STM)
libraries [29, 44] is to instrument memory accesses to de-
tect conflicts. STM libraries with optimistic concurrency
control [17] (OCC) record memory accesses, validate every
transaction post execution, and abort and re-execute transac-
tions when validation surfaces a conflict. The final outcome
is equivalent to executing transactions sequentially in some
order. This equivalent order is called serialization.

Prior works [5, 8, 18] have capitalized on the specifics
of the Blockchain use-case to improve on the STM perfor-
mance. Their approach is to pre-compute dependencies in
a form of a directed acyclic graph of transactions that can
be executed via a fork-join schedule. The resulting schedule
is dependency-aware, and avoids corresponding conflicts.
If entities are incentivized to record and share the depen-
dency graph, then some entities may be able to avoid the
pre-computation overhead.

In the context of deterministic databases, Bohm [21] demon-
strated a way to avoid pre-computing the dependency graph.
Bohm assumes that the write-sets of all transactions are
known prior to execution, and enforces a specific preset
serialization of transactions. As a result, each read is asso-
ciated with the last write preceding it in that order. Using
a multi-version data-structure [10], Bohm executes transac-
tions when their read dependencies are resolved, avoiding
corresponding conflicts.

Our contribution. We present Block-STM, an in-memory
smart contract parallel execution engine built around the
principles of optimistically controlled STM. Block-STM does
not require a priori knowledge of transaction write-sets,
avoids pre-computation, and accelerates transaction execu-
tion autonomously without requiring further communica-
tion. Similar to Bohm, Block-STM uses multi-version shared
data-structure and enforces a preset serialization. The final
outcome is equivalent to the sequential execution of transac-
tions in the preset order in which they appear in the block.

 
 
 
 
 
 
The key observation is that with OCC and a preset serial-
ization, when a transaction aborts, its write-set can be used
to efficiently detect future dependencies. This has two ad-
vantages with respect to pre-execution: (1) in the optimistic
case when there are few conflicts, most transactions are ex-
ecuted once, (2) otherwise, write-sets are likely to be more
accurate as they are based on a more up-to-date execution.
Anther advantage of the of the preset order is that it allows
as comprehensive correctness testing as we can compare to
a sequential execution output.

Two observations that contribute to the performance of
Block-STM in the Blockchain context are the following. First,
in blockchain systems, the state is updated per block. This
allows the Block-STM to avoid the synchronization cost
of committing transactions individually. Instead Block-STM
lazily commits all transactions in a block based on two atomic
counters and a double-collect technique [9]. Second, trans-
actions are specified in smart contract languages, such as
Move [11] and Solidity [51], and run in a virtual machine
that encapsulates their execution and ensures safe behavior.
Therefore, opacity [24] is not required, allowing Block-STM
to efficiently combine an optimistic concurrent control with
multi-version data structure, without additional mechanisms
to avoid reaching inconsistent states.

The main challenge in combining OCC and preset serial-
ization is that validations are no longer independent from
each other and must logically occur in a sequence. A failed
validation of a transaction implies that all higher transac-
tions can be committed only if they get successfully validated
afterwards. Block-STM handles this issue via a novel collabo-
rative scheduler that optimistically dispatches execution and
validation tasks, prioritizing tasks for transactions lower in
the preset order. While concurrent priority queues are noto-
riously hard to scale across threads [4, 40], Block-STM capi-
talizes on the preset serialization order and the boundedness
of transaction indices to implement a concurrent ordered set
abstraction using only a few shared atomic counters.

We provide comprehensive correctness proofs for both
Safety and Liveness, proving that no deadlock or livelock is
possible and the final state is always equivalent to the state
produced by executing the transactions sequentially.

A Rust implementation of Block-STM is merged on the
main branches of the Diem [47] and its successor Aptos [2]
open source blockchain code-bases [1, 3]. The experimental
evaluation demonstrates that Block-STM outperforms se-
quential execution by up to 20x on low-contention workloads
and by up to 9x on high-contention ones. Importantly, Block-
STM suffers from at most 30% overhead when the workload is
completely sequential. In addition, Block-STM significantly
outperforms a state-of-the-art deterministic STM [52] im-
plementation, and performances closely to Bohm which re-
quires perfect write-sets information prior to execution.

The rest of the paper is organized as following: Section 2
provides a high-level overview of Block-STM. Section 3 de-
scribes the full algorithm, while Section 4 describes Block-
STM implementation and evaluation. Section 5 discusses
related work and Section 6 concludes the paper. Appendix A
contains the comprehensive correctness proofs.

2 Overview
The input of Block-STM is a block of transactions, denoted
by BLOCK, containing 𝑛 transactions, which defines the pre-
set serialization order 𝑡𝑥1 < 𝑡𝑥2 < ... < 𝑡𝑥𝑛. The problem
definition is to execute the block and produce the final state
equivalent to the state produced by executing the transac-
tions in sequence 𝑡𝑥1, 𝑡𝑥2, . . .𝑡𝑥𝑛, each 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 executed to com-
pletion before 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+1 is started. The goal is to utilize available
threads to produce such final state as efficiently as possible.
Each transaction in Block-STM might be executed several
times and we refer to the 𝑖𝑡ℎ execution as incarnation 𝑖 of a
transaction. We say that an incarnation is aborted when the
system decides that a subsequent re-execution with an incre-
mented incarnation number is needed. A version is a pair of
a transaction index and an incarnation number. To support
reads and writes by transactions that may execute concur-
rently, Block-STM maintains an in-memory multi-version
data structure that separately stores for each memory loca-
tion the latest value written per transaction, along with the
associated transaction version. When transaction 𝑡𝑥 reads
a memory location, it obtains from the multi-version data-
structure the value written to this location by the highest
transaction that appears before 𝑡𝑥 in the preset serializa-
tion order, along with the associated version. For example,
transaction 𝑡𝑥5 can read a value written by transaction 𝑡𝑥3
even if transaction 𝑡𝑥6 has written to same location. If no
smaller transaction has written to a location, then the read
(e.g. all reads by 𝑡𝑥1) is resolved from storage based on the
state before the block execution.

For each incarnation, Block-STM maintains a write-set
and a read-set. The read-set contains the memory locations
that are read during the incarnation, and the corresponding
versions. The write-set describes the updates made by the
incarnation as (memory location, value) pairs. The write-set
of the incarnation is applied to shared memory (the multi-
version data-structure) at the end of execution. After an in-
carnation executes it needs to pass validation. The validation
re-reads the read-set and compares the observed versions.
Intuitively, a successful validation implies that writes ap-
plied by the incarnation are still up-to-date, while a failed
validation implies that the incarnation has to be aborted.

Dependency estimation. Block-STM does not pre-compute

dependencies. Instead, for each transaction, Block-STM treats
the write-set of an aborted incarnation as an estimation of
the write-set of the next one. Together with the multi-version
data structure and the preset order it allows reducing the

(a) Mark every value (in the multi-versioned data-structure) written by the incarnation (that failed validation) as an estimate.
(b) Create validation tasks for all transactions > 𝑡𝑥 that are not currently in 𝐸 or being executed and add them to 𝑉 .
(c) Create an execution task for transaction 𝑡𝑥 with an incremented incarnation number, and add it to 𝐸.

Figure 1. High level scheduling

Illustration of an example execution of the abstract Block-STM collaborative scheduler.
Initially, all transactions are in the ordered set 𝐸. In this example, transaction 𝑡𝑥4 depends on 𝑡𝑥2. In stage 1, since there are no validation tasks, the threads
execute transactions 𝑡𝑥1, 𝑡𝑥2, 𝑡𝑥3 in parallel. Then, in stage 2, the threads validate transactions 𝑡𝑥1, 𝑡𝑥2, 𝑡𝑥3 in parallel, the validation of 𝑡𝑥2 fails and the
validations of 𝑡𝑥1 and 𝑡𝑥3 succeed. The incarnation of 𝑡𝑥2 is aborted, each of its writes is marked as an estimate in the multi-version data-structure, the next
incarnation task is added to 𝐸, and a new validation task for 𝑡𝑥3 is added to 𝑉 . In stage 3, transaction 𝑡𝑥3 is validated and transactions 𝑡𝑥2 and 𝑡𝑥4 start
executing their respective incarnations. However, the execution of 𝑡𝑥4 reads a value marked as estimate, is aborted due to the dependency on 𝑡𝑥2 and the
thread executes the next transaction in 𝐸, which is 𝑡𝑥5. As explained above, 𝑡𝑥4 is recorded as a dependency of 𝑡𝑥2 and added back to 𝐸 when 𝑡𝑥2’s
incarnation finishes. After both 𝑡𝑥2 and 𝑡𝑥5 finish execution, the corresponding validation tasks are added to 𝑉 . In this example, the incarnation of 𝑡𝑥2 does
not write to a memory location to which its previous incarnation did not write. Therefore, another validation of 𝑡𝑥3 is not required. In stage 4, 𝑡𝑥2 and 𝑡𝑥5 are
successfully validated and 𝑡𝑥4 is executed. From this point on, 𝑡𝑥1, 𝑡𝑥2, and 𝑡𝑥3 will never be re-executed as there is no task associated with them in 𝑉 or 𝐸
(and no task associated with a higher transaction may lead to creating it). The execution of 𝑡𝑥4 writes to a new memory location, and thus 𝑡𝑥5 is added to 𝑉
for re-validation. In stage 5, transactions 𝑡𝑥4 and 𝑡𝑥5 are validated and transaction 𝑡𝑥6 is executed.

abort rate by efficiently detecting potential dependencies.
When an incarnation is aborted due to a validation failure,
the entries in the multi-version data-structure corresponding
to its write-set are replaced with a special estimate marker.
This signifies that the next incarnation is estimated to write
to the same memory location. In particular, an incarnation of
transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 stops and is immediately aborted whenever
it reads a value marked as an estimate that was written by
a lower transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 . This is an optimization to abort an
incarnation early when it is likely to be aborted in the future
due to a validation failure, which would happen if the next
incarnation of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 would indeed write to the same location
(the ESTIMATE markers that are not overwritten are removed
by the next incarnation).

Collaborative scheduler. Block-STM introduces a col-
laborative scheduler, which coordinates the validation and
execution tasks among threads. The preset serialization order
dictates that the transactions must be committed in order, so
a successful validation of an incarnation does not guarantee

that it can be committed. This is because an abort and re-
execution of an earlier transaction in the block might invali-
date the incarnation read-set and necessitate re-execution.
Thus, when a transaction aborts, all higher transactions are
scheduled for re-validation. The same incarnation may be
validated multiple times, by different threads, and potentially
in parallel, but Block-STM ensures that only the first abort
per version succeeds (the rest are ignored).

Since transactions must be committed in order, the Block-
STM scheduler prioritizes tasks (validation and execution) as-
sociated with lower-indexed transactions. Next, we overview
the high-level ideas behind the approach. The detailed logic
is described in Section 3 and formally proved in Appendix A.
Abstractly, the Block-STM collaborative scheduler tracks
an ordered set 𝑉 of pending validation tasks and an ordered
set 𝐸 of pending execution tasks. Initially, 𝑉 is empty and
𝐸 contains execution tasks for the initial incarnation of all
transactions in the block. A transaction 𝑡𝑥 ∉ 𝐸 is either
currently being executed or (its last incarnation) has com-
pleted. On a high level, each thread repeats the instructions
described in Figure 1.

When a transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 reads an ESTIMATE marker written
by 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 (with 𝑗 < 𝑘), we say that 𝑡𝑥𝑘 encounters a dependency.
We treat 𝑡𝑥𝑘 as 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s dependency because its read depends
on a value that 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is estimated to write. For the ease of
presentation, in the above description a transaction is added
back to 𝐸 immediately upon encountering a dependency.
However, as explained in Section 3, Block-STM implements
a slightly more involved mechanism. Transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 is first
recorded separately as a dependency of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , and only added
back to 𝐸 when the next incarnation of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 completes (i.e.
when the dependency is resolved).

The ordered sets, 𝑉 and 𝐸, are each implemented via a
single atomic counter coupled with a mechanism to track
the status of transactions, i.e. whether a given transaction
is ready for validation or execution, respectively. To pick a
task, threads increment the smaller of these counters until
they find a task that is ready to be performed. To add a
(validation or execution) task for transaction 𝑡𝑥, the thread
updates the status and reduces the corresponding counter
to 𝑡𝑥 (if it had a larger value). For presentation purposes,
the above description omits an optimization that the Block-
STM scheduler uses in cases 1(b) and 2(c), where instead of
reducing the counter value, the new task is returned.

Optimistic validation. An incarnation of transaction
might write to a memory location that was previously read
by an incarnation of a higher transaction according to the
preset serialization order. This is why in 1(a), when an incar-
nation finishes, new validation tasks are created for higher
transactions. Importantly, validation tasks are scheduled op-
timistically, e.g. it is possible to concurrently validate the
latest incarnations of transactions 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+1, 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+2 and 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+4.
Suppose transactions 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+1 and 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+4 are successfully
validated, while the validation of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+2 fails. When threads
are available, Block-STM capitalizes by performing these
validations in parallel, allowing it to detect the validation
failure of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+2 faster in the above example (at the expense of
a validation of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗+4 that needs to be redone). Identifying val-
idation failures and aborting incarnations as soon as possible
is crucial for the system performance, as any incarnation
that reads values written by a incarnation that aborts also
needs to be aborted, forming a cascade of aborts.

When an incarnation writes only to a subset of memory
locations written by the previously completed incarnation
of the same transaction, i.e. case 1(b), Block-STM schedules
validation just for the incarnation. This is sufficient due to
2(a), as the whole write-set of the previous incarnation is
marked as estimates during the abort. The abort leads to op-
timistically creating validation tasks for higher transactions
in 2(b). Threads that perform these tasks can already detect
validation failures due to the estimate markers on memory
locations, instead of waiting for a subsequent incarnation to
finish.

Commit rule. In [23], we derive a precise predicate for
when transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 can be considered committed (its roughly

4

when an incarnation is successfully validated after lower
transactions 0, . . . , 𝑗 − 1 have already been committed). It
would be possible to continuously track this predicate, but
to reduce the amount of work and synchronization involved,
the Block-STM scheduler only checks whether the entire
block of transactions can be committed. This is done by ob-
serving that there are no more tasks to perform and at the
same time, no threads that are performing any tasks.

3 Block-STM Detailed Description
In this section, we describe Block-STM. Upon spawning,
threads perform the run() procedure in Line 1. Our pseudo-
code is divided into several modules that the threads use.
The Scheduler module contains the shared variables and
logic used to dispatch execution and validation tasks. The
MVMemory module contains shared memory in a form of a
multi-version data-structure for values written and read by
different transactions in Block-STM. Finally, the VM module
describes how reads and writes are instrumented during
transaction execution.

Block-STM finishes when all threads join after returning
from the run() invocation. At this point, the output of Block-
STM can be obtained by calling the MVMemory.snapshot()
function that returns the final values for all affected memory
locations. This function can be easily parallelized and the
output can be persisted to main storage (abstracted as a
Storage module), but these aspects are out of the scope here.

3.1 High-Level Thread Logic
We start by the high-level logic described in Algorithm 1. The
run() procedure interfaces with the Scheduler module and
consists of a loop that lets the invoking thread continuously
perform available validation and execution tasks. The thread
looks for a new task in Line 9, and dispatches a proper han-
dler based on its kind, i.e. function try_execute in Line 5
for an EXECUTION_TASK and function needs_reexecution
in Line 7 for a VALIDATION_TASK (since, as discussed in Sec-
tion 2, a successful validation does not change state, while
failed validation implies that the transaction requires re-
execution). Both of this functions take a transaction version
(transaction index and incarnation number) as an input. A
try_execute function invocation may return a new vali-
dation task back to the caller, and a needs_reexecution
function invocation may return a new execution task.

3.1.1 Execution Tasks. An execution task is processed
using the try_execute procedure. First, a VM.execute func-
tion is invoked in Line 12. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, by the
VM design, this function reads from memory (MVMemory
data-structure and the main Storage), but never modifies
any state while being performed. Instead, a successful VM
execution returns a write-set, consisting of memory locations
and their updated values, which are applied to MVMemory
by the record function invocation in Line 18. In Block-STM,
VM.execute also captures and returns a read-set, containing
all memory locations read during the incarnation, each asso-
ciated with whether a value was read from MVMemory or
Storage, and in the former case, the version of the transac-
tion execution that previously wrote the value. The read-set
is also passed to the MVMemory.record call in Line 18 and
stored in MVMemory for later validation purposes.

Every MVMemory.record invocation returns an indica-
tor whether a write occurred to a memory location not writ-
ten to by the previous incarnation of the same transaction.
As discussed in Section 2, in Block-STM this indicator deter-
mines whether the higher transactions (than the transaction
that just finished execution, in the preset serialization order)
require further validation. Scheduler.finish_execution in
Line 19 schedules the required validation tasks. When a new
location is not written, wrote_new_location variable is set
to false and it suffices to only validate the transaction itself.

In this case, due to an internal performance optimization,
the Scheduler module sometimes returns this validation task
back to the caller from the finish_execution invocation.
The VM execution of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 may observe a read
dependency on a lower transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 in the preset order,
𝑘 < 𝑗. As discussed in Section 2, this happens when the last
incarnation of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 wrote to a memory location that 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 reads,
but when the incarnation of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 aborted before the read by
𝑡𝑥 𝑗 . In this case, the index 𝑘 of the blocking transaction is
returned as vm_result.blocking_txn_idx, a part of the output
in Line 12. In order to re-schedule the execution task for 𝑡𝑥 𝑗
for after the blocking transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 finishes its next incar-
nation, Scheduler.add_dependency is called in Line 14. This
function returns false if it encounters a race condition when
𝑡𝑥𝑘 gets re-executed before the dependency can be added.
The execution task is then retried immediately in Line 15.

3.1.2 Validation Tasks. A validate_read_set call in Line 22
obtains the last read-set recorded by an execution of txn_idx
and checks that re-reading each memory location in the
read-set still yields the same values. To be more precise, for
every value that was read, the read-set stores a read descrip-
tor. This descriptor contains the version of the transaction
(during the execution of which the value was written), or
⊥ if the value was read from storage (i.e. not written by a

comparing the corresponding descriptors.

failing validation per version may lead to a successful abort.

⊲ version is ⊥ when prior read returned NOT_FOUND

⊲ previously read entry from data, now ESTIMATE

⊲ previously read entry from data, now NOT_FOUND

⊲ read some entry, but not the same as before

Hence, if abort_validation returns false, then the incar-
nation was already aborted. If the abort was successful,
then convert_writes_to_estimates(txn_idx) in Line 25
is called, which replaces the write-set of the aborted version
in the shared memory data-structure with special ESTIMATE
markers. A successful abort leads to scheduling the trans-
action for re-execution and the higher transactions for valida-
tion during the Scheduler.finish_validation call in Line 26.

3.2 Multi-Version Memory
The MVMemory module (Algorithm 2) describes the shared
memory data-structure in Block-STM. It is called multi-
version because it stores multiple writes for each memory
location, along with a value and an associated version of a
corresponding transaction. In the pseudo-code, we represent
the main data-structure, called data, with an abstract map
interface, mapping (location, txn_idx) pairs to the correspond-
ing entries, which are (incarnation_number, value) pairs. In
order to support a read of memory location by transaction
𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , data provides an interface that returns an entry written
at location by the transaction with the highest index 𝑖 such
that 𝑖 < 𝑗 This functionality is used in Line 48 and Line 51.
For clarity of presentation, our pseudo-code focuses on the
abstract functionality of the map, while standard concurrent
data-structure design techniques can be used for an efficient
implementation (discussed in Section 4).

For every transaction, MVMemory stores a set of mem-
ory locations in the last_written_locations array and a set of
(location, version) pairs in the last_read_set array. We assume
that these sets are loaded and stored atomically, which can

7

be accomplished by storing a pointer to the set and accessing
the pointer atomically, i.e. via the read-copy-update [33].

Recording. The record function takes a transaction ver-
sion along with the read-set and the write-set (resulting
from the execution of the version). The write-set consists of
(memory location, value) pairs that are applied to the data
map by apply_write_set procedure invocation. The in-
vocation of rcu_update_written_locations that follows
in Line 40 updates last_written_locations and also removes
(in Line 33) from the data map all entries at memory loca-
tions that were not overwritten by the latest write-set of the
transaction (i.e. locations in the last_written_locations before,
but not after the update). This function also determines and
returns whether a new memory location was written (i.e.
in last_written_locations after, but not before the update).
This indicator is stored in wrote_new_location variable and
returned from the record function. Before returning, the
read-set of the transaction is stored in the last_read_set array
via an RCU pointer update.

The convert_writes_to_estimates procedure, called
during a transaction abort, iterates over last_written_locations
of the transaction, and replaces each stored (incarnation_number,
value) pair with a special ESTIMATE marker. It ensures that
validations fail for higher transactions if they have read the
data written by the aborted incarnation. While removing the
entries can also accomplish this, the ESTIMATE marker also
serves as a “write estimate" for the next incarnation of this

transaction. Any transaction that observes an ESTIMATE of
transaction 𝑡𝑥 when reading during a speculative execution,
waits for the dependency to resolve (𝑡𝑥 to be re-executed), as
opposed to ignoring the ESTIMATE and likely aborting if 𝑡𝑥’s
next incarnation again writes to the same memory location.
Reads. The MVMemory.read function takes a memory
location and a transaction index txn_idx as its input param-
eters. First, it looks for the highest transaction index, idx,
among transactions lower than txn_idx that have written to
this memory location (Line 48 and Line 51). Based on the
fixed serialization order of transactions in the block, this is
the best guess for reading speculatively (writes by transac-
tions lower than idx are overwritten by idx, and the specula-
tive premise is that the transactions between idx and txn_idx
do not write to the same memory location). The value writ-
ten by transaction idx is returned in Line 54, alongside with

the full version (i.e. idx and the incarnation number) and an
OK status. However, if the entry corresponding to transac-
tion idx is an ESTIMATE marker, then the read returns an
READ_ERROR status and idx as a blocking transaction index.
This is an indication for the caller to postpone the execu-
tion of transaction txn_idx until the next incarnation of the
blocking transaction idx completes. Essentially, at this point,
it is estimated that transaction idx will perform a write that
is relevant for the correct execution of transaction txn_idx.
When no lower transaction has written to the memory
location, a read returns a NOT_FOUND status, implying that
the value cannot be obtained from the previous transactions
in the block. As we will describe shortly, the caller can then
complete the speculative read by reading from storage.

The validate_read_set function loads (via RCU) the
most recently recorded read-set from the transaction’s ex-
ecution in Line 63. The function calls read for each loca-
tion and checks observed status and version against the
read-set (recall that version ⊥ in the read-set means that
the corresponding prior read returned NOT_FOUND status, i.e.
it read a value from Storage). As we saw in Section 3.1.2,
validate_read_set function is invoked during validation

in Line 22, at which point the incarnation that is being
validated is already executed and has recorded the read-
set. However, if the thread performing a validation task
for incarnation 𝑖 of a transaction is slow, it is possible that
validate_read_set function invocation observes a read-
set recorded by a later (i.e. > 𝑖) incarnation. In this case,
incarnation 𝑖 is guaranteed to be already aborted (else higher
incarnations would never start), and the validation task will

9

have no effect on the system regardless of the outcome (only
validations that successfully abort affect the state and each
incarnation can be aborted at most once).

The snapshot function is called after Block-STM finishes,
and returns the value written by the highest transaction for
every location that was written to by some transaction.

3.2.1 VM execution. In Algorithm 3 we describe how
reads and writes are handled in Block-STM by the VM.execute
function (invoked while performing an execution task, in Line 12).
This function tracks and returns the transaction’s read- and
write-sets, both initialized to empty. When a transaction at-
tempts to write a value to a location, the (location, value)
pair is added to the write-set, possibly replacing a pair with
a prior value (if it is not the first time the transaction wrote
to this location during the execution).

When a transaction attempts to read a location, if the loca-
tion is already in the write-set then the VM reads the corre-
sponding value (that the transaction itself wrote) in Line 85.
Otherwise, MVMemory.read is performed. If it returns
NOT_FOUND, then VM reads the value directly from storage
(abstracted as a Storage module that contains values pre-
ceding the block execution) and records (location, ⊥) in the
read-set. If MVMemory.read returns READ_ERROR, then VM
execution stops and returns the error and the blocking trans-
action index (for the dependency) to the caller. If it returns
OK, then VM reads the resulting value from MVMemory and
records the location and version pair in the read-set.

Note that for simplicity of presentation, if the transaction
reads the same location more than once, the pseudo-code
repeats the read and makes separate record in the read-set.
Even if reading the same location results in reading different
values, Block-STM algorithm maintains correctness because
all reads are eventually validated and the VM captures the
errors that may arise due to any opacity violations.

3.3 Scheduling
The Scheduler module contains the necessary state and syn-
chronization logic for managing the execution and valida-
tion tasks. For each transaction in a block, the txn_status
array contains the most up-to-date incarnation number (ini-
tially 0) and the status of this incarnation, which can be one
of READY_TO_EXECUTE (initial value), EXECUTING, EXECUTED
and ABORTING. The entries of the txn_status array are pro-
tected by a lock to provide atomicity.

Status transitions are illustrated in Figure 2. The thread
that changes the status from READY_TO_EXECUTE to EXECUTING
in Line 114 when incarnation number is 𝑖 performs incarna-
tion 𝑖 of the transaction. The status never becomes
READY_TO_EXECUTE(i) again, guaranteeing that no incarna-
tion is performed more than once. Afterwards, this thread
sets the status to EXECUTED(i) in Line 166. Similarly, only
the thread that changes the status from EXECUTED(i) to
ABORTING(i) returns true from try_validation_abort for
incarnation 𝑖. After performing the steps associated with a

10

successful abort, as discussed in Section 3.1.2, this thread
then updates the status to
READY_TO_EXECUTE(i + 1) in Line 158. This indicates that
an execution task for incarnation 𝑖 + 1 is ready to be created.
When incarnation 𝑖 of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 aborts because of a
read dependency on transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 (𝑗 < 𝑘 in the preset seri-
alization order), the status of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 is updated to ABORTING(i)
in Line 151. The corresponding add_dependency(k, j) in-
vocation returns true and Block-STM guarantees that some
thread will subsequently finish executing transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 and
resolve 𝑡𝑥𝑘 ’s dependency in Line 158 (called from Line 161)
by setting its status to READY_TO_EXECUTE(i + 1).

The txn_dependency array is used to track transaction
dependencies. In the above example, when transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘
reads an estimate of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 and calls add_dependency(k, j)
(that returns true), 𝑘 is added to txn_dependency[j] in Line 152.
Our pseudo-code explicitly describes lock-based synchro-
nization for the dependencies stored in the txn_dependency
array. This is to demonstrate the handling of a race between
the add_dependency function of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 and the finish_execution
procedure of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 (in particular, to guarantee that transaction
𝑡𝑥 𝑗 will always clear its dependencies in Line 167). The prob-
lematic scenario could arise if after 𝑡𝑥𝑘 observed the read
dependency, transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 raced to finish_execution
and cleared its dependencies. However, due to the check
in Line 149, dependency will not be added and the add_dependency
invocation will return false. Then, the status of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 would
remain EXECUTING and the caller would immediately re-
attempt the execution task of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 , incarnation 𝑖, in Line 15.
Managing Tasks. Block-STM scheduler maintains execu-
tion_idx and validation_idx atomic counters. Together, one
can view the status array and the validation (or execution)
index counter as a counting-based implementation of an or-
dered set abstraction for selecting lowest-indexed available
validation (or execution) task.

The validation_idx counter tracks the index of the next
transaction to be validated. A thread picks an index in Line 130
in the next_version_to_validate function by performing
the fetch_and_increment instruction on the validation_idx. It
then checks if the transaction with the corresponding index
is ready to be validated (i.e. the status is EXECUTED), and if it
is, determines the latest incarnation number. A similar execu-
tion_idx counter is used in combination with the status array
to manage execution tasks. In the next_version_to_execute
function, a thread picks an index by fetch_and_increment-
ing in Line 123, then invokes the try_incarnate function.
Only if the transaction is in a READY_TO_EXECUTE state, this
function will set the status to EXECUTING and return the
corresponding version for execution.

When transaction status is updated to READY_TO_EXECUTE,
Block-STM ensures that the corresponding execution task
eventually gets created. In the resume_dependencies pro-
cedure, the execution index is reduced by the call in Line 164

to be no higher than indices of all transactions that had a de-
pendency resolved. In finish_validation function after a
successful abort, however, there may be a single re-execution
task (unless the task was already claimed by another thread
after the status was set, something that is checked in Line 188).
As an optimization, instead of reducing execution_idx, the
execution task is sometimes returned to the caller in Line 189.
Similarly, if a validation of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 was successfully
aborted, then Block-STM ensures, in the finish_validation
function (in Line 185), that validation_idx ≤ 𝑘. In addition, in
the finish_execution function of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 , Block-
STM invokes decrease_validation_idx in Line 171 if a
new memory location was written by the associated incar-
nation. Otherwise, only a validation task for 𝑡𝑥𝑘 is created
that may be returned to the caller.

Finally, the next_task function decides whether to obtain
a version to execute or version to validate based on a simple
heuristic, by comparing the two indices in Line 138.

Detecting Completion. The Scheduler provides a mech-
anism for the threads to detect when all execution and valida-
tion tasks are completed. This is not trivial because individual
threads might obtain no available tasks from the next_task
function, but more execution and validation tasks could still
be created later, e.g. if a validation task that is being per-
formed by another thread fails.

Block-STM implements a check_done procedure that de-
termines when all work is completed and the threads can
safely return. In this case, a done_marker is set to true, pro-
viding a cheap way for all threads to exit their main loops
in Line 3. Threads invoke a check_done procedure in Line 120
and Line 127, when observing an execution or validation in-
dex that is already ≥ BLOCK.size(). In the following, we
explain the logic behind check_done.

A straw man approach would be to check that both ex-
ecution and validation indices are at least as large as the
BLOCK.size(). The first problem with this approach is that
it does not consider when the execution and validation tasks
actually finish. For example, the validation_idx may be in-
cremented in Line 130 and become BLOCK.size(), but it
would be incorrect for the threads to return, as the corre-
sponding validation task of transaction BLOCK.size() − 1
may still fail. To overcome this problem, Block-STM uti-
lizes the num_active_tasks atomic counter to track the num-
ber of ongoing execution and validation tasks. Then, in
addition to the indices, the scheduler also checks whether
num_active_tasks = 0 in Line 108.

The num_active_tasks counter is incremented in Line 122
and Line 129, right before execution_idx and validation_idx
are fetch-and-increment-ed, respectively. The num_active_tasks
is decremented if no task corresponding to the fetched in-
dex is created (Line 116 and Line 135), or after the tasks
finish (Line 174 and Line 190). As an optimization, when
finish_execution or finish_validation functions return

a new task to the caller, num_active_tasks is left unchanged
(instead of incrementing and decrementing that cancel out).
The second challenge is that validation_idx, execution_idx
and num_active_tasks are separate counters, e.g. it is possible
to read that validation_idx has value BLOCK.size(), then read
that num_active_tasks has value 0, without these variables
simultaneously holding the respective values. Block-STM
handles this by another counter, decrease_cnt, incremented
in decrease_execution_idx and
decrease_validation_idx procedures (Line 100, Line 105).
By reading decrease_cnt twice in check_done, it is possible
to detect if validation or execution index decreases from their
observed values when num_active_tasks is read to be 0.

4 Implementation and Evaluation
Our Block-STM implementation is in Rust, and is merged
on the main branch of the open source Diem and Aptos
projects [2, 47]. Both Blockchains run a virtual machine for
smart contracts in Move language [11]. The VM captures all
execution errors that could stem from inconsistent reads dur-
ing speculative transaction execution. The VM also caches
the reads from Storage. Importantly, the preset order allows
us to test correctness by comparing to sequential implemen-
tation outputs.

Diem VM does not support suspending transaction ex-
ecution at the exact point when a read dependency is en-
countered. Instead, when a transaction is aborted due to a
READ_ERROR, it is later (after the dependency is resolved)
restarted from scratch. Aptos VM supports this feature.

To mitigate the impact of restarting VM execution from
scratch, we check the read-set of the previous incarnation for
dependencies before the VM.execute invocation in Line 12.
Another related optimization implemented in Block-STM
occurs when the Scheduler.add_dependency invocation re-
turns false in Line 14. This indicates that the dependency
has been resolved. Instead of Line 15 (that would restart the
execution from scratch with the Diem VM), Block-STM calls
add_dependency from the VM itself, and can thus re-read
and continue execution when false is returned.

Block-STM implementation uses the standard cache padding
technique to mitigate false sharing. The logic for num_active_tasks
is implemented using the Resource Acquisition Is Initializa-
tion (RAII) design pattern. Finally, Block-STM implements
the data map in MVMemory as a concurrent hashmap over
access paths, with lock-protected search trees for efficient
txn_idx-based look-ups.

4.1 Experimental Results
We evaluated Block-STM on a Amazon Web Services c5a.16xlarge
instance (AMD EPYC CPU and 128GB memory) with Ubuntu
18.04 operating system. The experiments run on a single
socket with up to 32 physical cores without hyper-threading.

The evaluation benchmark executes the whole block, con-
sisting of peer-to-peer (p2p) transactions implemented in
Move. Each p2p transaction randomly chooses two different
accounts and performs a payment.

We first perform experiments with Diem p2p transactions 1
that perform 21 reads and 4 writes. For a Diem p2p trans-
action from account 𝐴 to account 𝐵, the 4 writes of the
transaction involve updating balances and sequence num-
bers of 𝐴 and 𝐵. The reason for 21 reads is that every Diem
transaction is verified against some on-chain information to
decide whether the transaction should be processed, some
of which is specific to p2p transactions. During this process,
information such as the correct block time and whether or
not the account is frozen is read.

We also perform experiments with Aptos p2p transac-
tions 2 that perform 8 reads and 5 writes each, where the
Aptos p2p transactions reduce many of the verification and
on-chain reads mentioned above. The VM execution over-
head of a single Diem p2p compared to a single Aptos p2p is
about 100%, as will be shown in Figure 3 and Figure 6, the
throughput of sequentially executing Diem and Aptos p2p
transaction is about 5𝑘 and 10𝑘, respectively. We experiment
with block sizes of 103 and 104 transactions and the number
of accounts of 2, 10, 100, 103 and 104. The number of accounts
determines the amount of conflicts, and in particular, with
just 2 accounts the load is inherently sequential (each trans-
action depends on the previous one). Each data point is an
average of 10 measurements.

This reported measurements include the cost of reading
all required values from storage, and computing the outputs
(i.e. all affected paths and the final values), but not persisting
the outputs to Storage. The outputs are computed accord-
ing to the MVMemory.snapshot logic, but parallelized (per
affected memory locations).

We compare Block-STM to Bohm [21] and LiTM [52].
Bohm is a deterministic database engine that enforces a
preset order by assuming transactions’ write-sets are known.
Bohm has a pre-execution phase in which it uses the write-
sets information to build a multi-version data-structure that

captures the dependencies with respect to the preset or-
der. Then, Bohm executes transactions in parallel, delays
any transaction that has unresolved read dependencies by
buffering it in a concurrent queue, and resumes the execu-
tion once the dependencies are resolved. Note that in the

Blockchain use-case the assumption of knowing all write-
sets in advance is not realistic, so to compare Block-STM
to Bohm we artificially provide Bohm with perfect write-
sets information. Note that our measurements of Bohm only
include parallel execution but not the write-sets analysis,
thus would be significantly better than the performance of
Bohm in practice when the write-sets analysis time is non-
negligible. LiTM [52], a recent deterministic STM library,
claims to outperform other deterministic STM approaches
on the Problem Based Benchmark Suite [45]. We describe
LiTM in more detail in Section 5. In order to have a uniform
setting for comparison, we implemented both a variant of
Bohm 3 and LiTM 4 in Rust in the Diem Blockchain.

The Block-STM comparison to Bohm, LiTM and sequential
baseline for Diem p2p transactions is shown in Figure 3. The
Block-STM comparison to sequential baseline for Aptos p2p
transactions is shown in Figure 6. We will open source all
our implementations and benchmarks to enable reproducible
results.

Comparison to Bohm [21]. The results show that Block-
STM has comparable throughput to Bohm in most cases, and
is significantly better with 32 threads and 103 block size.
Since Bohm relies on perfect write-sets information and thus
perfect dependencies among all transactions, it can delay
the execution of a transaction after all its dependencies have
been executed, avoiding the overhead of aborting and re-
execution. In contrast, Block-STM require no information
about write dependencies prior to execution and therefore
will incur aborts and re-execution. Still, the performance of
Block-STM is comparable to Bohm, implying the abort rates
of Block-STM is substantially small, thanks to the run-time
write-sets estimation and the low-overhead collaborative
scheduler. We also found the overhead of constructing the
multi-version data-structure of Bohm significant compared
to Block-STM, without which Bohm’s throughput will be
slightly better than Block-STM.

Comparison to LiTM [52]. With 104 accounts, Block-
STM has around 3-4x speedup over LiTM regardless of the
block size or transactions type (standard or simplified). With
103 accounts, the speedup is larger (up to 25x) over LiTM,
confirming that Block-STM is less sensitive to conflicts.

Comparison to sequential execution. For Diem and
Aptos benchmarks, Block-STM scales almost perfectly under
low contention, achieving up to 90𝑘 tps and 160𝑘 tps, which
is 18x and 16x over the sequential execution, respectively.

Comparison under highly contended workload. Fig-
ure 4 and Figure 7 reports Block-STM evaluation results with
highly contended workloads. With a completely sequential
workload (2 accounts) Block-STM has at most 30% overhead
vs the sequential execution in both Diem and Aptos bench-
marks. With 10 accounts Block-STM already outperforms
the sequential execution and with 100 accounts Block-STM
gets up to 8x speedup in both benchmarks. Note that with
100 accounts Block-STM does not scale beyond 16 threads,
suggesting that 16 threads already utilize the inherent paral-
lelism in such a highly contended workload.

Maximum throughput of Block-STM We also evalu-
ate Block-STM with increasing block sizes (up to 50𝑘) to
find the maximum throughput of Block-STM in Figure 5 and
Figure 8. For 32 threads, Block-STM achieves up to 110𝑘 tps
for Diem p2p (21x speedup over sequential) and 170𝑘 tps
for Aptos p2p (17x speedup over sequential). For 16 threads,
Block-STM achieves up to 67𝑘 tps for Diem p2p (13x speedup)
and 120𝑘 tps for Aptos p2p (12x speedup).

Conclusion. Our evaluation demonstrates that Block-
STM is adaptive to workload contention and utilizes the in-
herent parallelism therein. For Aptos benchmark, it achieves
over 160𝑘 tps on workloads with low contention, over 80𝑘 on
workloads with high contention, and at most 30% overhead
on workload that are completely sequential.

5 Related Work

The STM approach. The problem of atomically execut-
ing transactions in parallel in shared memory has been ex-
tensively studied in the literature in the past few decades in
the context of STM libraries (e.g., [17, 19, 22, 25, 28, 29, 44]).
These libraries instrument the concurrent memory accesses
associated with different transactions, detect and deal with
conflicts, and provide the final outcome equivalent to exe-
cuting transactions sequentially in some serialization order.
In the STM libraries based on optimistic concurrency con-
trol [17, 31], threads repeatedly speculatively execute and
validate transactions. A successful validation commits and
determines the transaction position in the serialization order.
By default, STM libraries do not guarantee the same out-
come when transactions are re-executed multiple times. This
is unsuitable for Blockchain systems, as validators need to
agree on the outcome of block execution. Deterministic STM
libraries [36, 38, 49] guarantee a unique final state.

14

Due to required conflict bookkeeping and aborts, general-
purpose STM libraries often suffer from performance limi-
tations compared to custom-tailed solutions and are rarely
deployed in production [14]. However, STM performance
can be dramatically improved by restricting it to specific
use-cases [20, 26, 30, 32, 46]. For the Blockchain use-case,
the granularity is a block of transactions. Thus, unlike the
general setting, Block-STM do not need to handle a long-
lived stream of transactions that arrive at arbitrary times
and commit them one by one. Moreover, thanks to the VM,
the Blockchain use-case does not require opacity [24].

Preset and deterministic order. There is prior work on
designing STM libraries constrained to the predefined se-
rialization order [34, 42, 50]. In [34, 50] each transaction is
committed by a designated thread and thus the predefined
order reduces resource utilization. This is because threads
have to stall until all previous transactions in the order are
committed before they can commit their own. Transactions
in [42] are also committed by designated threads, but they
limit the stalling periods to only the latency of the com-
mit via a complex forwarding locking mechanism and flat
combining [27] based validation.

Deterministic STM libraries [36, 38, 49, 52] consider a less
restricted case in which every execution of the same set of
transaction produces the same final state. The idea in the
state-of-the-art [52] is simple. All transactions are executed
from the initial state and the maximum independent set of
transaction (i.e., with no conflicts among them) is committed,
arriving to a new state. The remaining transaction are exe-
cuted from the new state, the maximum independent set is
committed, and so on. This approach thrives for low conflict
workloads, but otherwise suffers from high overhead.

To summarize, in the context of STM literature, the (de-
terministic or preset) ordering constraints have been viewed
as a “curse", i.e. an extra requirement that the system needs
to satisfy at the cost of added overhead. For the Block-STM
approach, on the other hand, the preset order is the “bless-
ing" that the whole algorithm is centered around. In fact,
the closest works to Block-STM in terms of how the preset
serialization order is used to deal with conflicts are from the
databases literature. Calvin [48] and Bohm [21] use batches
(akin to blocks) of transactions and their preset order to
execute transactions when their read dependencies are re-
solved. This is possible because, in the databases context,
the write-sets of transactions are assumed to be known in
advance. This assumption is not suitable for Blockchains as
smart contracts might encode an arbitrary logic. Therefore,
Block-STM does not require the write-set to be known and
learns dependencies on the fly.

Multi-version data-structures. Multi-version data struc-
tures are designed to avoid write conflicts [10]. They have a
history of applications in the STM context [13, 37], some of
which utilize optimistic concurrency control [12]. The multi-
version data-structure maps between memory locations and

Once this feature is available, Block-STM can restart execu-
tion from the read that caused suspension upon encountering
a dependency. A potential optimization to go along with this
feature is to validate the reads that happened during the
execution prefix (before transaction was suspended) upon
resumption. This could allow earlier detection of impending
aborts.

The current Block-STM implementation is not optimized
for NUMA architectures or hyperthreading. Exploring these
optimizations is another direction for future research. An-
other interesting direction is to explore nesting techniques [35]
for transactional smart contract design.

values that are indexed based on versions that are assigned
to transactions via global version clock [12, 17, 39].

Blockchain execution. The connection between STM
techniques and parallel smart contract execution was ex-
plored in the past [5, 7, 8, 18]. A miner-replay paradigm was
explored in [18], where miners parallelize block execution
using a white-box STM library application that extracts the
resulting serialization order as a “fork-join” schedule. This
schedule is sent alongside the new block proposal (via the
consensus component) from miners to validators. After the
block is proposed, validators utilize the fork-join schedule
to deterministically replay the block. ParBlockchain [5] in-
troduced an order-execute paradigm (OXII) for deterministic
parallelism. The ordering stage is similar to the schedule
preparation in [18], but the transaction dependency graph
is computed without executing the block. OXII relies on
read-write set being known in advance via static-analysis
or on speculative pre-execution to generate the dependency
graph among transactions. OptSmart [7, 8] makes two im-
provements. First, the dependency graph is compressed to
contain only transactions with dependencies; those that are
not included may execute in parallel. Second, execution uses
multi-versioned memory to mitigate write-write conflicts.
Hyperledger Fabric [6] and several related works [41, 43]
follow the execute-order-validate paradigm. As a result, the
execution phase can abort unserializable transactions before
ordering. Transactions in [15] are pre-executed off the critical
path to produce hints for final execution.

6 Summary
This paper presents Block-STM, a parallel execution engine
for the Blockchain use-case that achieves up to 170k tps
with 32 threads in our benchmarks. For a fully sequential
workload, it has a smaller than 30% overhead, mitigating any
potential performance attacks. Block-STM relies on the write-
sets of transactions’ last incarnations to estimate dependen-
cies and reduce wasted work. If write-set pre-estimation was
available, e.g., with a best effort static analysis, it could be
similarly used by the first incarnation of a transaction. More-
over, using static analysis to find the best preset order is an
interesting future direction.

Block-STM uses locking for synchronization in the Scheduler

module. It is possible to use standard multicore techniques
to avoid using locks, however, we did not see significant
performance difference in our experiments. Thus, we chose
the design with locks for the ease of presentation.

In Blockchain systems, there is usually an associated “gas”
cost to executing transactions. A single location for gas up-
dates, could make any block inherently sequential. However,
this issue is typically avoided by tracking gas natively, burn-
ing it or having specialized types or sharded implementation.
As discussed in the Section 4, Diem VM currently does
not support suspending and resuming transaction execution.

i.e. a time 𝑇 determines for each thread the operations that
it performed before 𝑇 .

A.1 Life of a Version
We say that validation of version 𝑣 = ( 𝑗, 𝑖) starts anytime
a validation task with version 𝑣 is returned to some thread
𝑡, either in Line 5 or in Line 9. We say execution of version
𝑣 starts immediately after Line 114 is performed that sets
the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 to EXECUTING(i). We say that
the execution of version 𝑣 aborts immediately after Line 151
is performed, and that the validation of version 𝑣 aborts
immediately after Line 179 is performed. In both cases, the
transaction status is set to ABORTING(i).

After thread 𝑡 starts the execution of version 𝑣, an exe-
cution task with 𝑣 is returned either in Line 7 or in Line 9.
Thread 𝑡 then invokes the try_execute function for the
execution task, which may invoke finish_execution pro-
cedure in Line 19. The finish_execution function is not
called only when the execution aborts, in which case we say
the execution finishes at the same time when it aborts. Simi-
larly, after a validation starts, 𝑡 invokes needs_reexecution
function for the validation task, which always invokes
finish_validation procedure in Line 26.

If Line 174 (for execution) or Line 190 (for validation)
is performed, then the corresponding validation or execu-
tion finishes immediately before. If these lines are not per-
formed in finish_execution and in finish_validation,
respectively, then the finish_execution invocation returns
a validation task and the finish_validation invocation
returns an execution task. We say that such an execution
finishes immediately before the try_execute invocation re-
turns in Line 5 (i.e. before validation starts for the version
in the returned task). Analogously, such a validation fin-
ishes immediately before a needs_reexecution invocation
returns in Line 7 (i.e. before execution starts for the version
in the returned task).

An update to a transaction status is always performed
by a thread while holding the corresponding lock. Figure 2
describes all possible status transitions. For example, once
txn_status[j] becomes EXECUTING(i), it can never be
READY_TO_EXECUTE(i) at a later time. By the code, illus-
trated in the allowable transitions in Figure 2, we have

Corollary 1. The following observations are true:
• The status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 must be set to

READY_TO_EXECUTE(i) in Line 158 before the execution
of the version 𝑣 = ( 𝑗, 𝑖) can start.

5Typically called executions in the literature, but we use the term run to
avoid a naming clash with transaction execution.

• Any version 𝑣 = ( 𝑗, 𝑖) can be executed at most once
(by a thread that updates the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 to
EXECUTING(i) from READY_TO_EXECUTE(i) to start the
execution of 𝑣). Only the executing thread may update
the status next, either to ABORTING(i) in Line 151 or to
EXECUTED(i) in Line 166.

• The status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 must be set to EXECUTED(i)
in Line 166 during the execution of version 𝑣 = ( 𝑗, 𝑖)
before any validation of 𝑣 can start. Once the status is set
to EXECUTED(i), it can only be updated to ABORTING(i)
in Line 179 during a validation of 𝑣.

• At most one execution or validation of version 𝑣 = ( 𝑗, 𝑖)
can abort, updating the status to ABORTING(i) either
in Line 151 from EXECUTING(i) or in Line 179 from
EXECUTED(i). The next update to the status of transac-
tion 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 must be to READY_TO_EXECUTE(i + 1) in Line 158.

A.2 Safety
We say that a pre-validation of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 starts any
time some thread 𝑡 performs a fetch_and_increment oper-
ation, returning 𝑗, in Line 130. The pre-validation finishes
immediately before 𝑡 performs Line 135, if this line is per-
formed. Otherwise, by code, a validation task for transaction
𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is returned from the
next_version_to_validate function invocation. In this
case, pre-validation finishes immediately before the valida-
tion task is returned in Line 9, i.e. before the corresponding
validation starts.

Definition 1 (Global Commit Index). The global commit
index at time 𝑇 is defined as the minimum among all the
following quantities at time 𝑇 :
• Scheduler.validation_idx
• all indices 𝑗, such that Scheduler.txn_status[j].status ≠

EXECUTED

• transaction indices with ongoing pre-validation
• transaction indices of versions with ongoing execution

or validation

We say that transactions 𝑡𝑥0, . . . , 𝑡𝑥𝑘 of the block are glob-
ally committed at time 𝑇 if the global commit index at time
𝑇 is strictly greater than 𝑘. Next, we prove the essential
properties of the commit definition.

Claim 1. If transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 is committed at time 𝑇 , then it is
also committed at all times 𝑇 ′ ≥ 𝑇 .
Proof. We prove this claim by a simple inductive reasoning
on time. Specifically, for every time 𝑇 ′ ≥ 𝑇 we prove that
𝑘 is strictly less than the global commit index at time 𝑇 ′.
The base case for time 𝑇 follows from the Claim assumption.
For the inductive step, we suppose the assumption holds at
time 𝑇 ′ and show that the Definition 1 still leads to a global
commit index > 𝑘 when the next event after 𝑇 ′ takes effect.
• The operation may change validation index from time
𝑇 ′ only in Line 104, which can be due to a call in Line 171

18

(during finish_execution) or in Line 185 (during
finish_validation). In the first case, if validation_idx
is reduced to value 𝑗, there must be an ongoing execu-
tion with transaction index 𝑗 at time 𝑇 ′. In the second
case, there must be an ongoing validation with transac-
tion index 𝑗 at time𝑇 ′. Thus, in both cases, by inductive
hypothesis, 𝑗 > 𝑘.

• The operation may change a status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗
from EXECUTED only in Line 179, in which case there
is an ongoing validation with transaction index 𝑗 at
time 𝑇 ′. Thus, by inductive hypothesis, 𝑗 > 𝑘.

• A fetch-and-increment operation in Line 130 may start
a pre-validation of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 . The validation_idx
must have been 𝑗 at time 𝑇 ′ and by inductive hypoth-
esis, 𝑗 > 𝑘.

• If validation of a version 𝑣 with transaction index 𝑗
starts immediately after 𝑇 ′, then there must have been
a pre-validation or an execution of version 𝑣 that ended
immediately before, hence, that was ongoing at time
𝑇 ′. Thus, by inductive hypothesis, 𝑗 > 𝑘.

• If an execution of a version 𝑣 with transaction index 𝑗
starts immediately after 𝑇 ′, then let us consider two
cases:
– if an execution task was returned in Line 7, then
there was a validation of a version with index 𝑗 (pre-
vious incarnation) that ended immediately before,
and hence, was ongoing at time 𝑇 ′. Thus, by induc-
tive hypothesis, 𝑗 > 𝑘.

– if an execution task was returned to some thread 𝑡
in Line 9, then, by the code, the status of transac-
tion 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 must have been previously set to EXECUTING
by 𝑡. By Corollary 1, the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗
may not change to EXECUTED until 𝑡 starts the exe-
cution. Thus, since the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is
not EXECUTED at time 𝑇 ′, by inductive hypothesis,
𝑗 > 𝑘.

Hence, the global commit index is monotonically non-
□

decreasing with time.

Next, we prove some auxiliary claims regarding the inter-
play between transaction status and shared (execution and
validation) indices.

Claim 2. Suppose all transactions are eventually committed,
and that at all times after 𝑇 the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is
EXECUTED. If no validation of a version of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 starts after 𝑇 ,
then the validation index must be > 𝑗 at all times after 𝑇 .

Proof. Let us assume for contradiction that validation_idx
is at most 𝑗 at some time 𝑇 ′ ≥ 𝑇 . Since all transactions
are eventually committed and due to Claim 1, validation_idx
must have value BLOCK.size() > 𝑗 at some time after 𝑇 ′. The
validation index is only incremented in Line 130, which is by
definition a start of pre-validation. Therefore, transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗
must start pre-validation after 𝑇 ′, and pre-validation must

19

finish due to Definition 1 since all transactions are eventually
committed. By the claim assumption, transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s status
is EXECUTED, so by code (due to Line 133), pre-validation
finish must lead to a start of a validation of a version of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ,
□
giving the desired contradiction.

Claim 3. Suppose all transactions are eventually committed,
and 𝑖 is the highest incarnation of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 such that
version 𝑣 = ( 𝑗, 𝑖) is executed. Then, 𝑣 must start validation
after Line 166 is performed in the execution of 𝑣.
Proof. The execution of version 𝑣 sets the status of trans-
action 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 to EXECUTED(i) in Line 166. The execution of
𝑣 eventually finishes due to Definition 1 and Claim 1, as
transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 eventually commits. If a validation task is
returned in Line 173, then a validation of version 𝑣 starts
immediately after execution finishes. Otherwise, by Corol-
lary 1, the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 will remain EXECUTED(i)
unless it is updated to ABORTING(i) by some validation of
𝑣, which also concludes the proof of the claim. If the status
remains EXECUTED(i) and a validation task is not returned,
then validation index has a value at most 𝑗 after the status up-
date in Line 166 due to Line 169 and Line 171. Then, Claim 2
implies that a validation must start after Line 166 is per-
□
formed.

Next, we establish the correctness invariant of the com-
mitted transactions. When we refer to a sequential run of
all transactions, we mean the execution of transaction 𝑡𝑥0,
followed by the execution of transaction 𝑡𝑥1, etc, for all trans-
actions in the block.
Lemma 1. After all transactions are committed, MVMemory
contains exactly the paths written in the sequential run of all
transactions. Moreover, a read of a path from MVMemory
with txn_idx = BLOCK.size() returns the same value as the
contents of the path after the sequential run.
Proof. Suppose all transactions are eventually committed.
Since initial status for each transaction is READY_TO_EXECUTE,
while Definition 1 requires status EXECUTED, by the code, for
each transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 the version ( 𝑗, 0) must start executing at
some point. Also, due to the commit definition and Claim 1,
all executions that start must finish (in order for the trans-
actions to eventually be committed). In fact, by Claim 1 the
total number of executions, validations and pre-validations
must be finite and they must all finish. For each transaction
index 𝑗, let 𝑚 𝑗 the the highest incarnation for which there
is an execution of version ( 𝑗, 𝑚 𝑗 ). By Corollary 1, among
the versions of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 that are executed, version
( 𝑗, 𝑚 𝑗 ) is executed last. We show by induction on 𝑗 that the
execution of version ( 𝑗, 𝑚 𝑗 ) reads the same paths and values
from MVMemory as the execution of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 would
during the sequential run. Thus, at the end of version ( 𝑗, 𝑚 𝑗 )
execution, all entries with transaction index 𝑗 in MVMemory
also correspond to the same paths and contain the same val-
ues as the write-set in the sequential run.

The base case holds because every read with txn_idx = 0
reads from storage. Next, suppose the inductive claim holds
for transactions 𝑡𝑥0, . . . , 𝑡𝑥𝑘 . By Claim 3, version 𝑣𝑘+1 =
(𝑘 + 1, 𝑚𝑘+1) is validated at least once after Line 166 is per-
formed during 𝑣𝑘+1’s (unique, by Corollary 1) execution. Any
validation of 𝑣𝑘+1 that starts also finishes in order for the
global commit index to reach values above 𝑘 + 1. Finally,
no validation of version 𝑣𝑘+1 may abort, as this would set
txn_status[k+1] to an ABORTING status and prevent global
commit index from reaching BLOCK.size() without another
incarnation of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘+1, contradicting the maximal-
ity of 𝑚𝑘+1. Therefore, we only need to show that a value read
at any access path during the validation of 𝑣𝑘+1 is the same
as in the sequential run of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘+1. Then, since the
validation must succeed, the execution of 𝑣𝑘+1 must have
read the same values, and produced a compatible output to
the sequential run, proving the inductive step.

Let 𝛼 be the validation of 𝑣𝑘+1 that starts last. Let 𝑝 be any
path read during 𝛼, and let 𝑣𝑝 be the corresponding version
observed during the validate_read_set invocation that
returned true (if the read returned a READ_ERROR in Line 67
then 𝛼 would fail). If 𝑣𝑝 = ⊥, then validation 𝛼, and the cor-
responding execution of version 𝑣𝑘+1 both read from storage.
If 𝑣𝑝 is a version of some transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , since MVMemory
only reads values from lower transactions, we have 𝑗 < 𝑘 + 1.
Version 𝑣𝑝 is written during a record call invoked in Line 18
during an execution that sets the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 to
an EXECUTED status before finishing. We show this must have
been the last execution of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 using a proof by contradiction.
Otherwise, by Corollary 1, a validation 𝛽 of the same version
of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 must follow and abort. Thus, by code, before finishing,
𝛽 marks path 𝑝 as an ESTIMATE, after it is read by 𝛼. The
validation_idx is then ensured to be at most 𝑗 in Line 185 in
𝛽, contradicting Claim 2 (Due to Claim 3 the status of trans-
action 𝑡𝑥𝑘+1 is set to EXECUTED(mk+1) in Line 166 during the
execution of 𝑣𝑘+1, before 𝛼 starts. Since no validation of 𝑣𝑘+1
aborts, by Corollary 1, txn_status[k+1] never changes from
EXECUTED).

Hence, if 𝑣𝑝 is a version of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , then the value read from
𝑝 is in fact the value written at path 𝑝 during the execution
of the last 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s version ( 𝑗, 𝑚 𝑗 ). By the induction hypothesis,
this is the same value that transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 writes at 𝑝 in
the fully sequential run. To finish the proof, suppose for
contradiction that in the sequential run transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘+1
reads a value written by transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ′ with 𝑗 ′ > 𝑗. The
validation 𝛼 did not observe any entry from 𝑗 ′ at path 𝑝,
not even an ESTIMATE. However, by induction hypothesis,
during the execution of version ( 𝑗 ′, 𝑚 𝑗 ′) the same value as in
the sequential run must be written to path 𝑝. Therefore, after
a read by 𝛼, there is an execution of a version of transaction
𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ′ that sets wrote_new_path to true due to 𝑝 and decreases
validation index by calling Line 171. This again contradicts
our assumption about 𝛼 and completes the proof, as the

20

argument when 𝑣𝑝 = ⊥ instead of 𝑣𝑝 = ( 𝑗, 𝑚 𝑗 ) is analogous.
□

A.2.1 Number of Active Tasks. What is left is to show
is the safety of the check_done mechanism for determin-
ing when the transactions are committed. The key is to un-
derstand the role of the num_active_tasks variable in the
Scheduler module. The num_active_tasks is initialized to 0
and incremented in Line 122 and Line 129. The increment
in Line 129 is accounting for the pre-validation that starts
with a fetch-and-increment in the following line (Line 130).
The num_active_tasks is decremented in Line 135 if no val-
idation task corresponding to the fetched index is created.
Otherwise, pre-validation leads to a the start of a validation,
and num_active_tasks is decremented immediately after the
validation finishes, in Line 190 (unless an execution task
is created for the caller). The logic for execution tasks is
analogous, with one difference that an execution can also
finish in Line 151, in which case num_active_tasks is decre-
mented shortly after, in Line 153. When finish_execution
or finish_validation functions return a new task to the
caller, num_active_tasks is left unchanged (instead of incre-
menting and decrementing that cancel out). It follows that
num_active_tasks is always non-negative. The following aux-
iliary claims establish useful properties of when the value
becomes 0.

Claim 4. Suppose the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 was set to
READY_TO_EXECUTE at time 𝑇 , and did not change until a later
time 𝑇 ′. If execution index was at most 𝑗 at some time between
𝑇 and 𝑇 ′, then either num_active_tasks > 0 or execution_idx
≤ 𝑗 at time 𝑇 ′.

Proof. Let as assume for contradiction that at time 𝑇 ′
num_active_tasks is 0 and execution_idx is strictly larger than
𝑗, but that at some time between 𝑇 and 𝑇 ′, the execution
index was at most 𝑗. Since execution index reaches a value
larger than 𝑗 by time 𝑇 ′, a fetch-and-increment operation
must have been performed in Line 123 between 𝑇 and 𝑇 ′,
returning 𝑗. The num_active_tasks counter is incremented
in the previous line, in Line 122 (this is very similar to the
increment to account for pre-validation, while here it is an
analogous pre-execution stage). Since the status is of transac-
tion 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 remains READY_TO_EXECUTE until 𝑇 ′, the only way
to reduce num_active_tasks to 0 at time 𝑇 ′ is to perform
the corresponding decrement, which by code, would occur
only after an execution of a version of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 (due
to Line 113). However, before an execution finishes (and then
num_active_tasks is decremented), it must perform Line 113
and since the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is READY_TO_EXECUTE,
it must update the status to EXECUTING in Line 114, giving
the desired contradiction with assumption in the claim. □

Lemma 2. Suppose execution_idx ≥ BLOCK.size(), valida-
tion_idx ≥ BLOCK.size() and num_active_tasks is 0 simul-
taneously at time 𝑇 . Then, all transactions are committed at
time 𝑇 .

Proof. As num_active_tasks is 0 at time 𝑇 , there may not be
an ongoing pre-validation, validation or execution at time 𝑇 .
This is because an increment corresponding of num_active_tasks
always occurs before the start, while the decrement always
occurs after the finish of the corresponding pre-validation,
validation or execution. Next, we will prove that for any
transaction index 𝑗, Scheduler.txn_status[j].status = EXECUTED
at time 𝑇 . Then, by Definition 1, the global commit index is
equal to the validation_index, which is at least BLOCK.size(),
meaning that all transactions are committed at time 𝑇 .

In the following, we prove by contradiction that all trans-
actions must have an EXECUTED status at time 𝑇 . Suppose 𝑗
is the smallest index of a transaction with a non-EXECUTED
status. Consider three cases:

• Scheduler.txn_status[j].status = READY_TO_EXECUTE.
We consider the time when the READY_TO_EXECUTE
status was last set for transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 in Line 113. This
is due to a call either in Line 161 or in Line 184.
– Call in Line 161: there is an ongoing execution, which
must finish in order for num_active_tasks to be 0 at
time 𝑇 . Before finishing,
the decrease_execution_idx invocation in Line 164
ensures that the execution index has a value at most
𝑗. Thus, by Claim 4, the execution index is at most 𝑗
at time 𝑇 . A contradiction.

– Call in Line 184: there is an ongoing validation which
must finish in order for num_active_tasks to be 0
at time 𝑇 . Before finishing, execution_idx must be
observed in Line 186 to be strictly higher than 𝑗, or
we would get a contradiction with Claim 4. But then,
try_incarnate must be called in Line 187, which
by code, would observe READY_TO_EXECUTE status
and update it to EXECUTING, contradicting the status
at time 𝑇 .

• Scheduler.txn_status[j].status = EXECUTING. By Corol-
lary 1 and the definition of execution, there must be an
ongoing execution at time 𝑇 (of a version of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 by the
thread that set the status), which we already showed
is impossible.

• Scheduler.txn_status[j].status = ABORTING. Let 𝑇 ′ be
the time when the ABORTING status was last set for
transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , which can be in Line 151 or in Line 179.
– call in Line 151 in an add_dependency invocation:
in this case, txn_idx must be 𝑗 and the thread must
be holding a lock on the status of a blocking_txn_idx,
which we will call 𝑗 ′. Because MVMemory only
reads entries, including an ESTIMATE, from lower
transactions, and reading an ESTIMATE is required
for calling the add_dependency function, we have

21

𝑗 ′ < 𝑗. Since Line 151 was performed, due to the
check in Line 149, the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ′ can-
not be EXECUTED, but by the minimality of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 it must
be EXECUTED at time 𝑇 . Therefore, an execution of a
version of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ′ must invoke Line 166 between times
𝑇 ′ and 𝑇 . This execution must finish in order for
num_active_tasks to be 0 at time 𝑇 , meaning that
resume_dependencies invocation in Line 168 must
be completed before 𝑇 . However, due to locks, 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is
now a dependency of 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ′, and this resume_dependencies
invocation must update the status of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗
to
READY_TO_EXECUTE due to the call in Line 161, con-
tradicting the status at time 𝑇 .

– call in Line 179: there is an ongoing validation which
must finish in order for num_active_tasks to be 0 at
time 𝑇 . Before finishing, the status must be updated
to READY_TO_EXECUTE due to the call in Line 184,
□
contradicting the status at time 𝑇 .

A.2.2 Safety Guarantees.

Lemma 3. Let time 𝑇 be right before the operation in Line 99
or operation in Line 104 by thread 𝑡 takes effect. Suppose
num_active_tasks is 0 at some time 𝑇 ′ ≥ 𝑇 . Then, thread 𝑡
must have incremented decrease_cnt (in Line 100 or in Line 105)
between times 𝑇 and 𝑇 ′.

Proof. Performing Line 99 as a part of
decrease_execution_idx reduces execution_idx to the min-
imum of execution_idx and target_idx, while performing Line 104
as a part of decrease_validation_idx is similar for the
validation_idx. The decrease_execution_idx procedure is
invoked only in Line 164 as a part of an ongoing execu-
tion, and accounting for this execution, num_active_task
must be at least 1 during the whole invocation. Hence, in
order for num_active_tasks to become 0, it must be decre-
mented after the execution completes. Thus, 𝑡 must first
complete decrease_execution_idx, which includes per-
forming Line 100.

The decrease_validation_idx procedure is invoked ei-
ther as a part of validation that aborts, or as a part of exe-
cution when wrote_new_path is true in finish_execution.
In both cases, num_active_tasks is at least 1 accounting for
the ongoing validation or execution, since both finish after
decrease_validation_idx invocation completes. Hence,
in order for num_active_tasks to become 0, by code, 𝑡 must
decrement it after it finishes execution of validation. How-
ever, before doing so, it must perform Line 105 and return
□
from the decrease_validation_idx invocation.

Theorem 1. If a thread joins after invoking the run procedure,
then all transactions are necessarily committed at that time.

Proof. The threads return from the run invocation when they
observe a done_marker = true in Line 102. The done_marker

is set to true in Line 109 after observing that validation_idx ≥
BLOCK_SIZE, execution_idx ≥ BLOCK_SIZE and num_active_tasks
is 0. These checks are not performed atomically, but instead
a double-collect mechanism is used on the decrease_count
variable, which is a monotonically non-decreasing counter.
In particular, check_done confirms that decrease_count did
not change (increase) while execution_idx, validation_index
and num_active_tasks were read.

Since a thread joined, decrease_count did not increase
while it first observed execution_idx to be at least BLOCK_SIZE
at time𝑇1, then observed validation_idx to be at least BLOCK_SIZE
at time 𝑇2 > 𝑇1, and finally observed num_active_tasks to be 0
at time𝑇3 > 𝑇2. We show by contradiction that num_active_tasks
was 0 and execution_idx and validation_idx were still at least
BLOCK.size() simultaneously at 𝑇3. Assume by contradic-
tion that 𝑇3 does not have this property. Thus, execution_idx
must be decreased between 𝑇1 and 𝑇3 or validation_idx must
be decreased between 𝑇2 and 𝑇3. In both cases, we can ap-
ply Lemma 3, implying that decrease_count must have been
incremented between 𝑇1 and 𝑇3, giving the desired contra-
diction.

Therefore, check_done only succeeds if the number of
active tasks is 0 while the execution index and the valida-
tion index are both at least BLOCK.size() at the same time.
By Lemma 2 and, all transactions must be committed at this
□
time.

The MVMemory.snapshot function internally calls read
with txn_id = BLOCK.size() for all affected paths. By The-
orem 1 all transactions are committed after a thread joins,
so Lemma 1 implies the following

Corollary 2. A call to MVMemory.snapshot() after a thread
joins returns the exact same values at exact same paths as
would be persisted at the end of a sequential run of all trans-
actions.

A.3 Liveness
We prove liveness under the assumption that every thread
keeps taking steps until it joins6 and that the VM.execute
is wait-free. We start by formally defining pre-execution in
an analogous fashion to pre-validation. A pre-execution of
a transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 starts any time some thread 𝑡 performs a
fetch_and_increment operation, returning 𝑗, in Line 123. The
pre-execution finishes immediately before 𝑡 performs Line 116,
if this line is performed. Otherwise, by code, an execution
task for transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 is returned from the
next_version_to_execute function invocation. In this case,
pre-execution finishes immediately before the execution task
is returned in Line 9, i.e. before the corresponding execution
starts.

6A standard assumption used to prove deadlock-freedom and starvation-
freedom of algorithms, which are equivalent in our, single-shot, setting.

Lemma 4. There are finitely many pre-executions, executions,
pre-validations and validations.

Proof. We prove the lemma by induction on transaction in-
dex, with a trivial base case (no pre-execution, execution, pre-
validation or validation occurs for transactions with indices
< 0). For the inductive step, show that for any transaction
index 𝑘 there are finitely many associated pre-executions,
pre-validations, executions or validations. For the inductive
hypothesis, we only assume that there are finitely many exe-
cutions and validations for versions of transactions indexed
< 𝑘. It implies that after some finite time 𝑇 :

(a) the execution index is never updated to a value ≤ 𝑘
in Line 99. The decrease_execution_idx procedure
is only called in Line 164 as a part of an ongoing exe-
cution of some transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 when execution index
is reduced to the minimum index of other transactions
that depend on 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 , all of which must have index > 𝑗
(as only higher-indexed transactions could have read
from MVMemory an ESTIMATE written during 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s
execution and become a dependency).

(b) the entries in MVMemory for transactions indexed
lower than 𝑘 never change. This holds because
MVMemory.record invocation in Line 18 that affects
entries with transaction index 𝑗, is, as defined, a part
of transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s execution.

Due to (a), only one pre-execution of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 may
start after time 𝑇 , so there are finitely many pre-executions
for 𝑡𝑥𝑘 in total. Next, we show that there is at most one vali-
dation of a version of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 that aborts after time 𝑇 . If such a
version exists, let (𝑘, 𝑖) be the first version that aborts after
𝑇 . Due to Corollary 1, version (𝑘, 𝑖) may not abort more than
once, and after it aborts, an execution of version (𝑘, 𝑖+1) must
complete before any validation of version (𝑘, 𝑖 +1) (or higher)
starts. However, no validation of version (𝑘, 𝑖 + 1) may abort,
since by (b), the entries associated with transaction indices
strictly smaller than 𝑘 no longer change in the multi-version
data-structure, i.e. MVMemory.validate_read_set for a
version whose execution started after 𝑇 necessarily returns
true in Line 22. Thus, after some finite time no execution of
a version of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 may start, as this only happens
either following a pre-execution or a validation that aborts.
Moreover, we can now show that similar to (a) for the exe-
cution index, after some finite time, the validation index can
never be reduced to a value ≤ 𝑘 in Line 104. This is because
the decrease_validation_idx procedure is either called
in Line 171, when the validation_idx may be reduced to 𝑗 as
a part of a transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s ongoing execution, or it is called
in Line 185, when the validation index may be reduced to
𝑗 + 1 as a part of a transaction 𝑡𝑥 𝑗 ’s ongoing validation.

Therefore, there are finitely many pre-validations of trans-
action 𝑡𝑥𝑘 and as a result, no validation of a version of 𝑡𝑥𝑘
may start after some finite time. This is because a validation
starts either following a pre-validation, or an execution of

by Claim 5, and by code there is no other potential wait-
ing involved in pre-execution, pre-validation, execution or
□
validation.

Theorem 2. If threads keep taking steps before they join and
VM.execute is wait-free, then all threads eventually join.
Proof. For contradiction, suppose some thread never joins.
By the theorem assumption, the thread keeps taking steps
and by Claim 5, it acquires all required locks within finitely
many steps. Moreover, since the VM.execute function is
wait-free, by Corollary 3, after some finite time there can
be no ongoing pre-execution, pre-validation, execution or
validation. By code, the thread in this case must keep repeat-
edly entering the loop in Line 3 and invoking next_task
in Line 9, while both the execution index and the validation
index are always ≥ BLOCK.size - otherwise, a pre-execution
or pre-validation would commence.

Since decrease_execution_idx and decrease_validation_idx

procedures are only invoked as a part of an ongoing execu-
tion or validation, respectively, after some finite time, this
counter remains unchanged. Finally, by the mechanism that
counts the active tasks, described in Section A.2.1, num_active_tasks
counts ongoing pre-executions, pre-validations, executions
and validations. By code and since all threads keep taking
steps before they join, the counter is always decremented
after these finish. Since by Lemma 4, all pre-executions, pre-
validations, executions and validations eventually finish, af-
ter some finite time the num_active_tasks counter must al-
ways be 0.

The thread that repeatedly invokes next_task must also
repeatedly call check_done procedure. However, by the above,
after some finite time it must set the done_marker to true
in Line 109. However, the next time the thread reaches Line 3,
it will not enter the loop and join, proving the theorem by
□
contradiction.

a version of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 . As there are finitely many threads, we ob-
tain that there are finitely many total pre-validations and
pre-executions of transaction 𝑡𝑥𝑘 , as well as executions and
□
validations versions of 𝑡𝑥𝑘 .

In Block-STM, locks are used to protect statuses and depen-
dencies for transactions. We now prove starvation-freedom
for these locks.

Claim 5. If threads keep taking steps before they join, then any
thread that keeps trying to acquire a lock eventually succeeds.

Proof. A lock on transaction dependencies is acquired in Line 148
or in Line 167, both of which, by definition, occur as a part of
some version’s execution. There are more cases of when
a lock on a transaction status may be acquired. The op-
erations in Line 112 and in Line 132 are a part of a pre-
execution of pre-validation of some transaction, respectively.
The lock may be acquired in Line 156 in order to set the
READY_TO_EXECUTE status as a part of an ongoing execution
(call to set_ready_status in Line 161) or validation (call
in Line 184). The operation in Line 166 sets the status to
EXECUTED as a part of an ongoing execution, and the op-
eration in Line 179 sets the status to ABORTING as a part
of an ongoing validation (that aborts). The remaining two
instances in Line 149 and in Line 151 occur as a part of a ver-
sion’s execution when a dependency is encountered, while
the thread is also holding a lock on dependencies. These are
the only instances when a thread may simultaneously hold
more than one lock, and also only the two operations within
any critical section that may involve waiting. Because the
acquisition order in these cases is unique (first the lock for
dependencies, then for status) and all threads keep taking
steps, a deadlock is therefore impossible.

Moreover, as described above, all acquisitions happen as a
part of an ongoing pre-execution, pre-validation, execution
or validation. By Lemma 4, there are finite number of these,
implying that in our setting, deadlock-freedom is equivalent
to starvation-freedom, i.e. as long as threads keep taking
steps, any thread that tries to acquire a lock in Block-STM
□
must eventually succeed.

Combining the above claims, we show

Corollary 3. Suppose all threads keep taking steps before they
join and VM.execute is wait-free. Then, after some finite time,
there may not be any ongoing pre-execution, pre-validation,
execution or validation.

Proof. By Lemma 4, there are finitely many pre-executions,
pre-validations, executions and validations. Since all threads
keep taking steps, to complete the proof we need to show
that they all finish within finitely many steps of the invok-
ing thread. This is true because VM.execute is assumed to
be wait-free, lock are acquired within finitely many steps
