ABSTRACT
This research contributes to the security design of an advanced smart drone
swarm  network  based  on  a  variant  of  the  Blockchain  Governance  Game
(BGG),  which  is  the  theoretical  game  model  to  predict  the  moments  of
security  actions  before  attacks,  and  the  Strategic  Alliance  for  Blockchain
Governance Game (SABGG), which is one of the BGG variants which has
been adapted to construct the best strategies to take preliminary actions based
on strategic alliance for protecting smart drones in a blockchain-based swarm
network.  Smart  drones  are  artificial  intelligence  (AI)-enabled  drones  which
are  capable  of  being  operated  autonomously  without  having  any  command
center. Analytically tractable solutions from the SABGG allow us to estimate
the  moments  of  taking  preliminary  actions  by  delivering  the  optimal
accountability  of  drones  for  preventing  attacks.  This  advanced  secured
swarm  network  within  AI-enabled  drones  is  designed  by  adapting  the
SABGG  model.  This  research  helps  users  to  develop  a  new  network-
architecture-level  security  of  a  smart  drone  swarm  which  is  based  on  a
decentralized network.

I. INTRODUCTION
Drones occupy an essential place in both military and civilian applications for various
roles  including  criminal  investigations,  public  safety  organizations,  transportation
management  facilities,  and  surveillance  forces  [1].  Because  of  dynamic  mobility,
quick  reaction  and  easy  deployment,  drones  offer  new  possibilities  for  different
applications  with  affordable  expense  [2].  A  drone  swarm  is  multiple  drones  being
used at once and drones in a swarm communicate and collaborate, making collective
decisions  of  collective  actions.  In  a  militarized  drone  swarm,  instead  of  10  or  100

1

distinct drones, the swarm forms a single, integrated weapon system guided by some
form of artificial intelligence [3]. The Blockchain Governance Game (BGG) has been
designed as a stochastic game model with the fluctuation and the mixed strategy game
for  analyzing  the  network  to  provide  the  decision  making  moment  for  taking
preliminary  security  actions  before  attacks.  The  model  is  targeted  to  prevent
blockchain  based  attacks  (i.e.,  the  51  percent  attack)  and  keeps  the  network
decentralized. Atypical case which an attacker tries to build an alternative blockchain
(blockchain forks) faster than regular miners [18].

The  proposed  ASDS  network  structure is  considered  and  the drones  in  a  swarm  are
connected  each  other  and  a  swarm  is  hooked  up  as  single  Blockchain  network  (see
Fig.  2).  Drones  in  a  swarm  are  fully  connected  but  these  may  not  connected  with  a
command center (or a control center). This drone swarm could execute thier command
artificially  and  independently  even  with  disconection  with  a  command  center.  Each
drone randomly generates unique data (e.g., GPS cordinates, motor RPM values) and
broadcase  these  data  to  other  drones  (which  is  equivalant  with  transaction  in  a
blockchain network). Each drone generates the value based on its mechanical action
and the generated values are sharing with all other drones in a swarm.

Fig 2. Adapting SA-BGG for the ASDS network architecture

To apply the SABGG into the ASDS network structure, the antagonistic game of two
players (called "A" and "H") are introduced to describe the Blockchain network in a
drone  swarm  as  a  defender  and  an  attacker.  The  joint  functional  of  the  Blockchain
network model with the strategic alliance is as follows:

Let us consider a two-person mixed strategy game, and player H (i.e., a drone swarm)
is  the  person  who  has  two  strategies  at  the  observation  moment,  one  step  before
attackers  complete  to  generate  alternative  chains  with  dishonest  transactions.  In  this
case, the cost will be not only all drones in a swarm but also the alliance costs. The
normal form of games is as follows:

A network security in an ASDS network is considered in this subsection. The strategy
for  protecting  the  ASDS  is  for  prierity  connection  with  neighbor  drones  to  give  the
less chance that an attacker catches blocks with false control requests. The example in
this  paper  is  targeting  20  drones  in  single  swarm  and  each  estimated  drone  value  is
around 1,500 USD in the swarm (see Table II).

IV. CONCLUSION
An advanced secure drone swarm network architecture protects a drone swarm from
an attacker by adapting a blockchain governance game variant. The~Strategic Alliance
for  Blockchain  Governance  Game  (SABGG)  which  is  an  analytically  proven  game
model  has  been  applied  as  a blockchain  governance  game  variant.  The SABGG has

5

       
         
been  adapted  for  a  decentralized  network  to  improve  drone  swarm  security.
The~special  SABGG  case  demonstrates  how  the  theoretical  model  is  actually
implemented for smart drone security. Although~this research is still theoretical and
there  are  several  steps  remaining  for  actual  implementation  into  real  drones,  the
practical case demonstrates how an SABGG network could be implemented for smart
drone securities and its feasibility. This paper is the first piece of research that applies
an  SABGG  model  into  a  swarm  network  architecture  security.  The~advanced  smart
drone  swarm  network  is  the  successor  of  blockchain-governance-game-based  IoT
security  applications,  particularly  in  the  intelligent  military  domain.  The  managerial
aspects and actual implementations of smart drone operations could be the next step.
Additionally,  expending  the  domains  for  applying  the  BGG  and  its  variants  could
definitely be another direction of future research.
