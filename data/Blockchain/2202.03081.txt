ABSTRACT 

The Sandbox metaverse LAND non-fungible token (NFT) prices increased 
by than 300 times (in USD) between December 2019 and January 2022, but 
when measured in  its  native utility  token (SAND), the increase is  only  3 
times. Depending on how prices are denominated, investment returns and 
effective transaction prices vary. We analyze more than 71,000 transactions 
and  find  that  users  are  willing  to  pay  3-4%  more  when  transactions  are 
settled  in  SAND,  and  30%  less  when  settled  in  wETH  (a  smart  contract 
version of ETH) when compared to ETH, so unit of account matters. Our 
results contribute to the discussions of blockchain-based, virtual economy 
management and the digitalization of money (Brunnermeier et al., 2019).

Introduction 

A  metaverse  is  a  digital  world  where  users’  avatars  can  interact  and  socialize  with  one 
another. What distinguishes this new-generation digital world from existing game platforms like 
Second Life, Roblox, or Minecraft is the fact that it is built on public blockchain. The assets in the 
metaverses are NFTs (non-fungible tokens – unique digital tokens that are not interchangeable) 
and can exist on blockchains even outside of the metaverses. In addition, blockchains allow the 
metaverses to have their own cryptocurrencies and thus their own financial ecosystems, providing 
a novel setting to test monetary theories. The word metaverse has recently caught public attention 
since  the  announcement  by  Facebook  (in  October  2021)  on  changing  its  name  to  Meta  and 
transforming into a metaverse company. 

The Sandbox was originally launched in 2012 as a game on iOS and Andriod. In 2018, The 
Sandbox was rebranded and rebuilt on the Ethereum blockchain. It became one of the most popular 
metaverses and users can purchase LAND and create ASSET to be used in the ecosystem. LAND 
is  an  NFT  representing  a  unique  digital  piece  of  real  estate  (identified  by  coordinates)  where 
166,464 LANDs (408x408) form a map of The Sandbox metaverse. Each LAND can be bought 
and sold separately or together as an ESTATE. The LAND/ESTATE presale events (i.e., primary 
market sales) were held in rounds by The Sandbox. Users may purchase LAND for two reasons: 
(i) hoping to generate revenue streams, or (ii) hoping to resell at a higher price. In the former case, 
users  can  build  games  and/or  interactive  experiences  on  LAND  hoping  to  earn  revenues  from 
visitors. In the latter case, they may choose to resell LAND in secondary markets such as OpenSea 
(a peer-to-peer  marketplace for NFTs).  Currently, various companies (e.g., Adidas, Atari, PwC 
Hong Kong, Binance, South China Morning Post) and celebrities (e.g., Snoop Dogg, Pranksy) are 
reported to have purchased LAND in The Sandbox. The most expensive sale was recorded at USD 
4.3  million.1 SAND  is  an  ERC-20  utility  token  used  as  the  native  currency  of  The  Sandbox 
metaverse. Users need SAND to transact within the ecosystem, including the primary LAND sales. 
However, for secondary sales, prices can be freely denominated in any other cryptocurrencies such 
as ETH, wETH, DAI, USDC, etc. 

In this paper, we focus on the returns to LAND investment using real estate analyses such 
as hedonic pricing regressions and price indices. By examining repeat sales (the exact same bundle 
of LAND/ESTATE bought or minted and then resold), we can more accurately assess whether 
purchasing and reselling LAND is a good investment in different denominations. Several papers 
have documented the economics and returns properties of metaverse real estate (e.g. Goldberg et 
al.,  2021;  Dowling,  2022)  but  base  their  analyses  on  USD.  Our  paper  takes  a  multi-currency 
approach  and  sheds  light  on  the  monetary  implications  of  a  virtual  economy  built  on  open 
blockchain.

Data and Methodology 

We obtain all LAND sale transactions from the Ethereum blockchain and supplement each 
LAND with data obtained from The Sandbox’s API, allowing us to track the contiguity of LAND

parcels  which  can  be  formed  into  bundles  or  ESTATEs. 2  Transactions  occurred  between 
December 5, 2019 and January 28, 2022, comprising both primary sales (minted directly from The 
Sandbox) and secondary sales (via OpenSea). Token price data is obtained from CoinGecko at 
daily frequency and used to convert transactions to a common denomination. We winsorize prices 
at  thresholds  of  0.1%  and  99.9%  to  limit  the  influence  of  outliers.  There  are  116,767  unique 
transactions when counted at parcel level, but when aggregated into bundles, the number of unique 
transactions is reduced to 71,205, with lot size ranging between 1 to 576 parcels. LAND age is 
computed as the difference in days between mint date and transaction date.  

Table 1 shows the distribution of tokens used for transactions and summary statistics. The 
time series of LAND transactions are plotted in Figure 1A, which shows that activity increased in 
late 2021, coinciding with Facebook’s announcement of name change. Prior to this announcement, 
ETH  and  LAND  prices  were  more  highly  correlated,  as  displayed  in  Figure  2.  When  SAND 
appreciated relative to ETH, the share of secondary transactions settled in SAND increased, as 
evident in Figure 1B. 

Table 1: Summary statistics 
Panel A reports the token denomination of sale by type. Primary sales are LAND minted directly from The Sandbox 
and secondary sales are auctioned/sold on OpenSea. ETH is the Ethereum blockchain’s native coin, which is also used 
to pay gas, wETH is an ERC-20 token (wrapped) version of ETH, SAND is The Sandbox’s ERC-20 utility token that 
is used to purchase in-game LAND and ASSET introduced in August 2020, and DAI and USDC are ERC-20 token 
with prices pegged to USD (stablecoins). Prior to SAND’s introduction, LAND was minted with DAI. Panel B reports 
summary statistics of LAND at sale. Repeat sales are defined as transactions involving the bundle of LAND (same lot 
size and coordinates), which are a subset of secondary sales. Prices are converted to USD using daily prices obtained 
from CoinGecko. Lot size is the number of LAND parcels that are combined into a bundle. Only transactions involving 
contiguous parcels are included in the sample. Age is the number of days between the transaction date and the LAND 
mint date.

Figure 1: LAND transactions 
Weekly  LAND  transactions  and  SAND  prices  are  reported  in  Panel  A.  Sales  include  both  primary  sales  (minted 
directly from The Sandbox) and secondary sales (on OpenSea). For repeat sales, the same bundle of LAND must have 
been  previously  bought  (or  minted)  and  then  sold.  SAND  is  The  Sandbox’s  ERC-20  utility  token  that  is  used  to 
purchase in-game LAND and ASSET, so primary sales of LAND are settled in SAND. Panel B reports the weekly 
share of secondary sales that are settled in SAND against an index of relative price between ETH and SAND. Higher 
index means SAND price has appreciated relative to ETH. The series in panel A begins at week 49 of 2019 but the 
series in panel B begins at week 33 of 2020 because SAND was introduced in August 2020.

To create all-sales price indices, we use the hedonic price index method (Fisher, Geltner 
and Webb, 1994; Hill, 2013) and regress log prices on controls and indicator variables 𝛿𝑡 for each 
week-year as specified in Equation 1. The exponents of 𝛿𝑡 are the index levels for each period. We 
compute the indices for three different denominations: USD, ETH and SAND, where ETH is the 
Ethereum blockchain’s native coin (which is also used to pay gas) and SAND is The Sandbox’s 
ERC-20 utility token that is used to purchase in-game LAND and ASSET introduced on 14 August

2020. Users are free to denominate the token of settlement for OpenSea auctions/sales, and the 
main tokens are ETH, wETH – an ERC-20 token (wrapped) version of ETH, DAI and USDC – 
ERC-20  tokens  with  prices  pegged  to  USD  (stablecoins),  and  SAND. 3 We  include  indicator 
variables  for  different  settlement  tokens  with  ETH  (43.1%  of  all  transactions)  as  the  omitted 
category.  Other  control  variables  include  the  natural  log  of  lot  size,  LAND  age  and  indicator 
variable for primary sale (99.4% occur in SAND). 

Δpit = ∑ 𝛿𝑡

To better measure investment returns, we identify repeat sales by requiring that lot size and 
coordinates of the LAND bundle are the same when purchase and resold. For example, a sale of a 
3x3 bundle that was combined from 9 parcels purchased separately is not a repeat sale, thus repeat 
sales are a subset of secondary transactions. By using same bundle, time-invariant unobservable 
characteristics are controlled for, reducing the concern of omitted variable bias. We use the Case 
and Shiller (1987) method to construct repeat sales indices which requires three steps.4 First, time 
indicators are regressed on price changes (Equation 2) to generate residuals. Second, the squared 
residuals are regressed on holding periods (in weeks) to generate predicted residuals. Third, the 
predicted residuals are used as weights to re-estimate Equation 2. 

3. 

Results 

First, we begin with hedonic regressions (Equation 1) in various denominations in Table 
2.5 The adjusted R-squared for USD and ETH prices are very high, suggesting that time trends 
play an important role in prices. Across all denominations, coefficients on lot size, LAND age and 
primary sale variables have the same directions and similar magnitudes. Primary sale prices are 
33.9% lower on average, reflecting early buyer advantage.  

In this paper, we are interested in the influence of denominations, so we turn our attention 
to the settlement variables. Compared to ETH, transactions settled in wETH and USDC are priced 
significantly lower (25-30%), while SAND settlements are priced higher (3-4%).6 On OpenSea, 
users who make unsolicited offers must use wETH by platform design, but wETH can also be used 
in auctions. We cannot distinguish between solicited and unsolicited sales, but the large discount 
is likely a mixture of unsolicited sales and the additional costs of obtaining wETH. Brunnermeier 

3 ETH and wETH are structurally different because ETH is a native coin which is part the Ethereum blockchain, while 
wETH is an ERC-20 token created from a wETH smart contract by depositing ETH in exchange for a “wrapped” 
version  wETH.  Consequently,  wETH  can  be  viewed  as  a  synthetic  ETH  pegged  1:1.  In  our  sample,  the  price 
correlation between ETH and wETH  is  0.99997.  Most  smart contract transactions  on blockchain  involve  ERC-20 
tokens, so developers often ask users to use wETH rather than ETH for coding simplicity. The cost of wrapping ETH 
into wETH is gas, which is not based on the nominal value, so it can be costly to obtain wETH in small amount. For 
The Sandbox’s LAND, users can use ETH, wETH, USDC, DAI, SAND and ATRI (AtariToken, a native coin of the 
Atari blockchain owned by Atari, a game developer that partners with The Sandbox). ATRI is hardly used on OpenSea 
so we exclude sales settled in ATRI in our analysis.  
4 The advantage of the Case-Shiller method is that it allows  for time-weighting of transactions, so we  choose this 
method. There are other approaches to constructing repeat sales price indices. Nagaraja, Brown and Wachter (2014) 
compare five methods and conclude that all indices are adequate.  
5 Because SAND was introduced in August 2020, transactions prior to SAND’s existence are excluded for  analyses 
denominated in SAND. 
6 DAI is primarily used to mint LAND, so there is little variation left for secondary transactions. 

5 

 
 
et al. (2019) surmise that “digital money” of the same denomination can be different if users do 
not view them as perfect substitute – a digital version of Gresham’s law.7 While ETH is pegged to 
wETH, the friction in obtaining wETH may reduce willingness to pay. 

The wedge between SAND and USDC can reflect the buyers’ frame of reference. When 
viewed in USDC (hence USD), LAND may be expensive; but viewed in SAND (which appreciated 
by almost 200x during the sample period), LAND is cheap. The unit of account effect can influence 
buyers’ willingness to pay, making the effective USDC prices lower and effective SAND prices 
higher when quoted as USD. 

Table 2: Hedonic regressions of LAND prices 
This table reports the results from the hedonic pricing regressions of the natural log of LAND prices (denominated in 
various units) on control variables: natural log of lot size, natural log of LAND age, indicator variable for primary sale 
(minted from The Sandbox) [omitted category is secondary sale], indicator variables for different tokens used to settle 
the sale [omitted category is ETH], and indicator variables for year-week of transaction. Standard errors are adjusted 
for heteroskedasticity and reported in parenthesis. Stars correspond to statistical significance level, with *, ** and *** 
representing 10%, 5% and 1% respectively.

We construct LAND all-sales price indices from 𝛿𝑡 and report them alongside SAND price 
in Figure 3. The correlation between the USD index and SAND is 0.9779, while the correlation to 
the SAND index is -0.0291. When viewed in USD, LAND prices reached the maximum of 302x, 
but only 11.6x in ETH and 3.0x in SAND. When the SAND price effect is purged from LAND 
index construction, price appreciation is much closer to traditional real estate. 

7 Gresham’s law refers to a situation where two types of money with fixed exchange ratio are not viewed as perfect 
substitute. The classic example is gold and silver coins, where gold coins (preferred, or “good” money) are hoarded 
and silver coins (“bad” money) spent, potentially leading to deviation from the fixed exchange rate.

Figure 3: LAND all-sales price indices 
Weekly LAND all-sales price indices are constructed using the hedonic price index method (Fisher, Geltner and Webb, 
1994;  Hill,  2013).  Both  primary  sales  (minted  directly  from  The  Sandbox)  and  secondary  sales  (on  OpenSea)  are 
included in the index construction. Transaction prices for the indices are denominated in USD (panel A), ETH (panel 
B) and SAND (panel C). ETH is the Ethereum blockchain’s native coin which is also used to pay gas, and SAND is 
The Sandbox’s ERC-20 utility token that is used to purchase in-game LAND and ASSET. Indices begin at week 49 
of 2019 for USD and ETH but at week 33 of 2020 for SAND because the token was introduced in August 2020. For 
each index, the correlation coefficient between the index level and SAND token price is reported.

All-sales indices are good for tracking general prices but do not directly assess investment 
returns, since weekly sales can involve new real estate with different (unobservable) attributes. We 
use repeat sales on the same parcel  and compute multiple on invested capital (MOIC) in USD, 
ETH and SAND, which are reported in Table 3. The distributions of MOICs are highly positively 
skewed,  especially  for  USD.  Figure  4  plots  the  histograms,  capping  MOIC  at  20x  for  ease  of 
comparability. The lower average returns in SAND are consistent with the moderated SAND index 
observed in Figure 3C. 

Table 3: Returns statistics of repeat sales 
Returns  on  repeat  sales  are  presented  as  multiple  on  invested  capital  (MOIC),  which  is  computed  as  the  current 
transaction price divided by the previous transaction price. Consequently, MOIC of 2x means 100% return on invested 
capital. Prices are converted to USD, ETH and SAND using daily prices obtained from CoinGecko.

Figure 4: Multiple on invested capital of LAND sales 
Multiple on invested capital (MOIC) is computed as the current transaction price divided by the previous transaction 
price. Displayed MOICs are capped at 20x for ease of comparability. Prices are converted to USD, ETH and SAND 
using daily prices obtained from CoinGecko. 

Figure 5: LAND price indices from repeat sales 
Weekly LAND price indices are constructed from repeat sales transactions using the Case and Shiller (1987) method. 
Only secondary sales (on OpenSea) that have identifiable previous transactions are included in the index construction. 
Transaction prices for the indices are denominated in USD (panel A), ETH (panel B) and SAND (panel C). ETH is 
the Ethereum blockchain’s native coin which is also used to pay gas, and SAND is The Sandbox’s ERC-20 utility 
token that is used to purchase in-game LAND and ASSET. Indices begin at week 33 of 2020 to allow for sufficient 
repeat sales in each week and to coincide with the introduction of SAND in August 2020. For each denomination, the 
correlation coefficient between the repeat sales index level and the all-sales index level are reported. For Panel B and 
C, the scales are the same for all-sales and repeat sales indices.

The Case-Shiller indices are reported in Figure 5 along with all-sales indices from Figure 
3. The levels for USD and ETH indices are much lower, with the maximum levels at 12.3x and 
6.9x respectively, suggesting that all-sales indices could be driven by composition change. The 
correlations between the two types of indices for each denomination are also high, at 0.7828 and 
0.8332. The fall in USD indices began in December 2021, coinciding with a fall in both ETH and 
SAND  prices.  For  SAND  indices,  the  trends  are  slightly  different,  and  the  correlation  is  much 
lower  at  0.1268.  From  these  pictures,  one  may  reach  different  conclusions  about  LAND’s 
performance under different denominations. 

Combined  with  earlier  results  where  willingness  to  pay  is  related  to  denomination,  our 
findings have important implications for management of open, virtual economy: unit of account 
matters. Viewed as The Sandbox’s native, LAND price did not appreciate that much and perhaps 
could  reflect  the  anticipated  productivity  of  LAND  denominated  in  SAND.  But  viewed  as  a 
“foreigner” (in USD or even ETH), LAND became much more costly by the end of 2021. Users 
who were able to obtain SAND at lower bases may behave differently, highlighting the behavioral 
influence of unit of account.

Metaverses are virtual economies whose ecosystems require careful management. Virtual 
world developers often carefully design and closely monitor the balance of the economy, and the 
introduction of unintended wealth such as real-money trading (the practice of purchasing in-game 
items with real-world monetary side agreements) can lead to price inflation and upset the economic 
incentives and users’ experiences, as discussed by Knowles and Castranova (2016). In this regard, 
The  Sandbox  can  be  considered  an  open  economy  with  no  capital  control  and  fully  flexible 
exchange rate, as the permissionless convertibility of blockchain tokens effectively allows perfect 
capital  mobility.  Under  the  Mundell-Fleming  view  of  the  “Impossible  Trinity”  (formalized  by 
Dornbusch, 1976), this virtual economy has no monetary sovereignty and has a fully liberalized 
financial  system,  which  can  be  hard  to  manage.  Also,  the  inability  to  meaningfully  restrict  the 
medium  of  exchange  for  secondary  transactions  means  virtual  economies’  own  currencies  can 
easily be supplanted (or “dollarized”), as illustrated by The Sandbox’s OpenSea auctions/sales.

Conclusion 

In  this  paper,  we  document  LAND  price  appreciation  in  The  Sandbox  metaverse  using 
methods employed for real estate analyses. We find that Case-Shiller repeat sales indices show 
more  moderated  appreciation  than  all-sales  indices,  and  show  even  less  appreciation  when 
denominated in SAND. For a virtual economy native who views activities in SAND, LAND price 
did not appreciate that much. We also find that transactions settled in different denominations can 
influence willingness to pay, with wETH-settled LAND priced 30% lower, while SAND-settled 
LAND priced 3-4% higher, highlighting the psychological effect of “native” unit of account. 

In the context of digitalization of money of Brunnermeier et al. (2019), the wETH-ETH 
wedge is an example of “digital Gresham’s law”, and the ability to freely form side transactions 
outside the ecosystem’s control in any denomination highlights the ease of “digital dollarization” 
in an open, permissionless world enabled by public blockchains. These findings are also relevant 
for real economies. Financial liberalization has its benefits but also comes with concerns such as 
instability (Stiglitz, 2000), and current academic evidence is mixed (Kose et al., 2009). We hope 
that our findings contribute to the discussions on the implications of a virtual economy and digital 
money built on public blockchains.
