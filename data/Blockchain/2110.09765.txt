Abstract. In a PoW-based blockchain network, mining pools (the solo
miner could be regarded as a mining pool containing one miner) compete
to successfully mine blocks to pursue rewards. Generally, the rewards in-
clude the ﬁxed block subsidies and time-varying transaction fees. The
transaction fees are oﬀered by the senders whose transactions are pack-
aged into blocks and is increasing with the block size. However, the larger
size of a block brings the longer latency, resulting in a smaller probability
of successfully mining. Therefore, ﬁnding the optimal block size to trade
oﬀ these two factors is a complex and crucial problem for the mining
pools. In this paper, we model a repeated mining competition dynamics
in blockchain system as an evolutionary game to study the interactions
among mining pools. In this game, each pool has two strategies: to follow
the default size ¯B, i.e., the upper bound of a block size, or not follow.
Because of the bounded rationality, each mining pool pursues its evolu-
tionary stable block size (ESS) according to the mining pools’ computing
power and other factors by continuous learning and adjustments during
the whole mining process. A study framework is built for the general
evolutionary game, based on which we then theoretically explore the ex-
istence and stability of the ESSs for a case of two mining pools. Numerical
experiments with real Bitcoin data are conducted to show the evolution-
ary decisions of mining pools and to demonstrate the theoretical ﬁndings
in this paper.

Introduction

Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system [10], based on a public transaction
ledger, which is called the blockchain. Generally, a block is composed of a block
header and a block body, which contains a certain amount of transactions. Each
transaction is composed of the digital signature of the sender, the transaction
data, such as the value of digital tokens, the addresses of the sender and the
receiver, as well as the corresponding transaction fee. With the bitcoin system
developing, the number of transactions in the whole network increases quickly,

while the block size currently is limited to 1 MB. Such a bounded block size
results in the congestion of the blockchain network. To alleviate this situation,
Segregated Witness (SegWit) [9] is brought up and applied to segregate the
witness (digital signatures) from the transactions. Then the witness is put into
the “extended block”, which has no impact on the original block size. By SegWit,
a block is able to contain more transactions, enhancing the transaction processing
eﬃciency. This eﬀect is equivalent to expanding the block size to 2 MB. Thus
the block size of a newly mining block may be more than 1 MB.

Proof-of-work (PoW) is the most popular consensus applied in bitcoin blockchain

system, which reaches a consensus based on miners’ computing power. Under
the PoW-based consensus protocol, the process of successfully mining a block
includes two steps, i.e., solving the PoW puzzle and propagating the block to
be veriﬁed. During the propagation, the block is likely to be discarded because
of long latency which depends on the size of the block. The larger size of block
brings the longer latency, leading to a higher chance that the block suﬀers or-
phaned [5]. So, besides raising income from transaction fees by packaging more
transactions in a block, miners need to consider a suitable total size of the block
that would not deeply increase the probability to be orphaned. With the in-
centive of transaction fees and the long latency resulting from large block size,
how to select transactions and decide the total block size for maximum payoﬀ is
critical for every miner.

Game theory has been widely applied in mining management, such as com-
putational power allocation, fork chain selection, block size setting and pool
selection. In terms of block size setting, [13] analyzed the quantity setting of
block space with the eﬀect of a transaction fee market, in which a block space
supply curve and a mempool demand curve were introduced to ﬁnd the optimal
block space for the maximum payoﬀ of miners. By proposing a Bitcoin-unlimited
scheme, [15] modeled a non-cooperative game to examine the interaction among
the miners, each of whom chooses its own upper bound of the block size while it
invalidates and discards the excessive block that is larger than its upper bound.
And the game was proved to exist an unique Nash equilibrium where all miners
choose the same upper bound. Given the limitation on the number of transac-
tions included in the block, the interaction on choosing transactions between the
miners and the users was modeled as a non-cooperative game by [1]. The unique
Nash equilibrium of this game can be obtained when satisfying certain condi-
tions, which is related to the number of miners, the hash rate, bitcoin value, the
transaction fees, the block subsidy and the cost of the mining. As for dynamic
evolutionary behaviors in blockchain, [8] respectively modeled the dynamics of
block mining selection among pools and pool selection among individual miners
as an evolutionary game in a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain network. It identi-
ﬁed the hash rate and the block propagation delay as two major factors resulting
in the mining competition outcome. Also, in [12], evolutionary game was applied
to examine the process dynamics of selecting super nodes for transaction veri-
ﬁcation in the Delegated proof of stake (DPoS) blockchain. The authors found
that the strategy of candidates has to do with how much reward they can ob-

tain from the blockchain platform. Inspired by [6], we adopt its novel expected
payoﬀ function diﬀerent with that of [8], to study the block size determination
of mining pools in a dynamic process.

In this work, we assume that the mining pools are bounded rational and can
adapt their strategy on diﬀerent block sizes according to the received rewards.
Note that the total computing power of each mining pool and the long latency
also aﬀect the choices of pools. Accordingly, we model the repeated mining com-
petition as an evolutionary game, where each pool controlling a certain amount
of computing power has to decide whether following the default size—2 MB or
not, for maximum payoﬀs. Evolutionary stable strategies are considered to be the
solutions of this game. Then we perform theoretical analysis on the existences
and corresponding conditions of the ESS for a special case of two mining pools.
Finally, simulations are performed to verify the proposed schemes. In addition,
we discuss the impact of the hash rate of pools, the unit transaction fee, the unit
propagation delay ,as well as the default block size on the strategy decision of
mining pools.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the system
model and the reward function of pools. In Section 3, we formulate an evolu-
tionary game model to study the block size selection problem, and particularly
analyze a case of two mining pools. Section 4 presents the numerical results and
some additional analysis on diﬀerent factors, and concludes our study.

2 System Model and and Mining Pool’s Expected

Reward

In this paper, we consider the PoW-based blockchain system where there are n
mining pools, denoted by N = {1, 2, · · · , n}, and each contains several miners.
All mining pools compete to mine blocks by costing an amount of computing
power, and thus to pursue the corresponding rewards. Similar to [3] and [4], we
assume the whole system is in a quasi-static state, meaning no miners join in or
leave the system. Under this assumption, each miner keeps its state unchanged,
including which mining pool it is in, and how much computing power it has.
This leads to the mining pools’ constant scale and their total computing power.
By the consensus protocol of PoW, a mining pool, who obtains the reward,
must satisfy the following two conditions: it is the ﬁrst one to solve a proof-of-
work puzzle by consuming an amount of computing power and it is also the ﬁrst
one to make its mined block reach the consensus. The expected average block
arriving interval is about of T = 600 seconds, by adjusting the diﬃculty of the
proof-of-work puzzle. The whole mining process in a blockchain system consists
of a series of one-shot competitions, in each of which one block is mined. A one-
shot competition can be viewed as a non-cooperative game, in which all mining
pools are the players and they shall make decisions on the mined blocks’ size to
maximize their own rewards.

Similar to the model in [6], we compute the expected reward of each mining
pool i by regarding its block ﬁnding time in one-shot competition as a random

4

variable, denoted by Xi, which follows the exponential distribution. To be spe-
ciﬁc, let Bi be the block size decided by pool i. Denote hi (0 ≤ hi ≤ 1) to be
the relative computing power of pool i, that is the ratio of pool i’s computing
power to the total computing power in blockchain system. The propagation time
of pool i’s block is linear with its size Bi, that is qi = ρBi. It is obvious that
pool i’s block cannot reach the consensus if the block ﬁnding time is less than
the propagation time qi. The mining rate of pool i is denoted by λi = hi
T , where
T = 600 secs is the average block arriving interval. By the deﬁnition of the
exponential distribution, the probability density function (PDF) of Xi is

fXi (t; Bi, λi) =

0, t < qi;
λie−λi(t−qi), t ≥ qi.

(cid:26)

(1)

and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Xi is

FXi (t; Bi, λi) = P r(Xi ≤ t) =

0, t < qi;
1 − e−λi(t−qi), t ≥ qi.

(cid:26)

So, the probability that block ﬁnding time of pool i is larger than t is

P r(Xi > t) = 1 − FXi (t; Bi, λi) =

1, t < qi;
e−λi(t−qi), t ≥ qi.

(cid:26)

Deﬁne X to be the block ﬁnding time among all mining pools. Then X =
mini∈N {Xi}, i.e. the ﬁrst time to ﬁnd a block, and hence

P r(X > t) = Πi=1,··· ,nP r(Xi > t) = Πi∈Active(t)P r(Xi > t)

= ePi∈Active(t) [−λi(t−qi)],

(2)

where Active(t) = {i|qi ≤ t} is the pool set, each pool i in which has the prop-
agation time less than time t. For convenience, we call each pool i in Active(t)
an active pool at time t.

From the probability function of (2), it is not hard to derive the CDF and

PDF of random variable X as the follows

FX (t; B, λ) = 1 − P r(X > t) = 1 − ePi∈Active(t) [−λi(t−qi)];

fX (t; B, λ) = (

λi)ePi∈Active(t) [−λi(t−qi)],

(3)

(4)

Xi∈Active(t)

where B = (B1, · · · , Bn) and λ = (λ1, · · · , λn).

As stated before, the reward of a mined block comes from two aspects: the
ﬁxed subsidies R (e.g., 6.25 BTC for one block currently), and a variable amount
of transaction fees. Particularly, the transaction fees are more dependent on the
size of a block, since a block with a larger size contains more transactions. For
the sake of simplicity, we assume the total transaction fee is linearly dependent
on the block size, i.e., αBi. This is similar to the suggested pricing standard of
transaction fee for users in some token wallets, such as 0.0005 BTC per KB [11].
So the total reward for a block mined by pool i is R + αBi. In addition, the
probability that a pool i solves the proof-of-work puzzle at time t is the ratio of

its computing power to all other active mining pools at time t. Then the reward
of mining pool i in expectation at time t is

3 Evolutionary Game Model for Decision on Block Size

In a PoW-based blockchain system, we suppose that there are n independent
mining pools, each pool i owning an amount of relative computing power hi.
The whole mining process is a series of one-shot competitions, and all mining
pools compete to mine a block to win the reward in each one-shot. In this
paper, we model the mining competition dynamics as an evolutionary game
to study the dynamic interactions among mining pools. In our evolutionary
game model, each pool has two kinds of strategies: to follow the default size
¯B, i.e., the upper bound of a block size, or to choose the block size less than
¯B. For simlicity, these two strategies is named as ”following” strategy and ”not
following” strategy, respectively. Because of the bounded rationality, each mining
pool pursues its evolutionary stable block size (ESS) through continuous learning
and adjustments.

In this section, we ﬁrst propose the analysis scheme for general case, and
then theoretically analyze the existence and stability of the ESS for a case of
two mining pools

3.1 Analysis Scheme

In our evolutionary game model, there is a crucial problem for each mining
pool i that is how to decide the optimal block size to maximize its payoﬀ in
expectation. Note that each pool i has two kinds of strategies: one is to ﬁx the
block to default size, e.g., ¯B = 2M B, and the other is to choose a block size
Bi < ¯B. So in the k-th shot, let us deﬁne two subsets,

N 1(k) = {i ∈ N |Bi(k) < ¯B} and N 2(k) = N − N 1(k) = {i ∈ N |Bi(k) = ¯B},

and call (N 1(k), N 2(k)) a subset proﬁle. Clearly, subset proﬁle (N 1(k), N 2(k))
is determined after all mining pools making decisions on their block sizes. There

6

are 2n subset proﬁles totally in each one-shot, and hence we denote the collection
of subset proﬁles in the k-th slot by N (k) = {(N 1(k), N 2(k))}.

Suppose that a subset proﬁle (N 1(k), N 2(k)) in the k-th shot is given. Each
pool i ∈ N 1(k) selects the ”not following” strategy. In addition, it continues to
decide the optimal block size B∗
i < ¯B by maximizing its expected payoﬀ under
a given subset proﬁle (N 1(k), N 2(k)).

During the evolutionary game, the mining pools keep learning to adjust their
low-income strategies to a higher-income one dynamically. Until n mining pools
reach a stable strategy proﬁle, at which no one would like to change its strategy,
1 , B∗
an equilibrium state of block size (B∗
n) is obtained. Though all the
mining competitions are carried out during a series of discrete slots, we can view
each block generating slot as a very small interval with respect to the whole
mining process, and hence deal with it as a continuous version. It allows us to
apply the standard technique to study the evolutionary process for the decisions
on block size.

Let xi(k), 0 ≤ xi(k) ≤ 1, represent the probability of mining pool i ∈ N
to choose the “not following” strategy at the k-th slot. Correspondingly, the
probability of pool i to choose the default size is 1 − xi(k). If the choice of pool
i is not to follow the default size, then its conditional expected payoﬀ is

By [2], the growth rate of a strategy selected by a participant is just equal to
the diﬀerence between the payoﬀ of this strategy and its average payoﬀ. Then
the replicator dynamic equations for all mining pools are as follows:

fi(x) = ˙xi(k) = xi(k)(E1

i (k) − ¯Ei(k)), ∀i ∈ N.

(12)

According to the replicator dynamics 12, a mining pool would like to choose
a smaller block size, when its conditional payoﬀ E1
i (k) is larger than the average
payoﬀ Ei(k). Otherwise, it will set its block size as ¯B. A state is stable if no min-
ing pool would like to change its strategy over time in the replicator dynamics,
and such a stable state is considered to be the evolutionary equilibrium [7]. The
strategies in this state are evolutionary stable, called ESS. Speciﬁcally speaking,
when the payoﬀ of “not following” strategy is equal to the average payoﬀ for
each pool, all mining pools reaches the ESS and no one has incentive to change
its current strategy. Therefore, the ESS can be obtained by solving ˙xi(k) = 0
for all i ∈ N , whose solution is called the ﬁxed equilibrium point of replicator
dynamics.

3.2 A Case Study of Two Mining Pools

P

Based on the analysis scheme for general case in previous subsection, we con-
tinue to study the case of two mining pools (n = 2) to exemplify the equilibrium
analysis for the decision on block size. We normalize the whole computing power
in system, thus mining pool i’s relative computing power is hi ∈ h = {h1, h2}
2
and
i=1 hi = 1. The whole mining process contains a series of one-shot com-
petitions, and pool 1 and pool 2 need to decide their block sizes B1 and B2 to
pursue the optimal payoﬀs in each one-shot competition. Without loss of gen-
erality, we concentrate on the case of 0 ≤ h1 ≤ 1
2 ≤ h2 ≤ 1. The analysis for
the case of h2 ≤ h1 ≤ is symmetric, and thus we omit the discussion. As stated
in [6], “ a miner with less mining power prefers a smaller block size in order to
optimize his payoﬀ”. Thus the case of 0 ≤ h1 ≤ h2 ≤ 1 leads to B1 ≤ B2 in
one-shot competition and then the propagation time q1 = ρB1 ≤ q2 = ρB2. In a
one-shot mining competition, if B1 ≤ B2 ≤ ¯B, then

U1 = λ1(R + αB1)

(14)

Since each mining pool has two kinds of strategies, i.e., to follow the default
size ¯B, and not to follow, in a one-shot competition, there are four strategy
proﬁles: (B1, B2), (B1, ¯B), ( ¯B, B2), and ( ¯B, ¯B). Note that ( ¯B, B2) either does

8

JM. Chen, YK. Cheng et al.

not exist, or equals to ( ¯B, ¯B) under the condition of B1 ≤ B2 ≤ ¯B. So we do
not discuss this strategy proﬁle any more.

Clearly, each pool would receive diﬀerent payoﬀs, under diﬀerent strategy
proﬁles. For the strategy proﬁle (B1, B2), meaning that both pools choose the
“not following” strategy, we deﬁne the payoﬀs of two pools π1
11 are
their optimal payoﬀs subject to the conditions of B1 < ¯B and B2 < ¯B. The
1 , B∗
corresponding optimal block sizes (B∗

2 ) can be obtained by solving

11 and π2

∂U2(B1, B2)

simultaneously. For the strategy proﬁle (B1, ¯B), showing that pool 1 would not
follow the default size and pool 2’s block size is ¯B, π1
12 are denoted to be
the payoﬀs of pool 1 and 2. To be speciﬁc, π1
12 is deﬁned to be the optimal payoﬀ
of pool 1 under the condition of B1 < ¯B and the corresponding optimal block
size B∗
= 0. For the strategy proﬁle
of ( ¯B, ¯B), both of two pools set their block sizes as ¯B, then their payoﬀs are
denoted by π1
22. We illustrate the payoﬀs of two pools under diﬀerent
strategy proﬁles in the following payoﬀ matrix (Table 1).

Recall that xi(k), i = 1, 2, is the probability of mining pool i to adopt
the “following” strategy in the k-th slot competition, and thus 1 − xi(k) is the
probability of mining pool i to follow the default size. The expected payoﬀs of
mining pool 1 in the k-th slot competition, when it chooses “not following” or
“follow” strategy, are

E1

1 (k) = x2(k)π1

11 + (1 − x2(k))π1

12; E2

1 (k) = (1 − x2(k))π1

22.

The average payoﬀ of mining pool 1 is

E1(k) = x1(k)E1

1 (k) + (1 − x1(k))E2

1 (k).

Similarly, we can derive the expected payoﬀs of mining pool 2 as follows,

E1

2 (k) = x1(k)π2

11; E2

2 (k) = x1(k)π2

12 + (1 − x1(k))π2

22.

The average payoﬀ of mining pool 2 is

E2(k) = x2(k)E1

2 (k) + (1 − x2(k))E2

2 (k).

Based on the analysis scheme (12) for the general case, the replicator dynamic
system of pool 1 and 2 for the case of two mining pools are:

f1(x) = ˙x1(k) = x1(1 − x1)(E1

1 − E1) = x1(1 − x1)

f2(x) = ˙x2(k) = x2(1 − x2)(E1

2 − E2) = x2(1 − x2)

By the results in [2], if a ﬁxed equilibrium point (x1, x2) is an ESS, then the

equivalent to determinant Det(J(x1, x2)) > 0 and trace T r(J(x1, x2)) < 0.

From the condition of

α < 0, we can see that the ﬁxed subsidy R is
quite high (> α
λ1ρ ). Under this condition, Theorem 3 states an possibility that
neither of pools would like to choose transactions into their blocks. It means
that the mining pools may give up the available transaction fees in hopes of
enhancing their chances to win the high ﬁxed subsidy. The detailed proof can
be found in Appendix D.

4 Numerical Experiments and Conclusions

4.1 Numerical Experiments

In this section, we would analyze the case of two mining pools for the decision
on block size. Based on the statistic data about Bitcoin blockchain on [14] , we
ﬁrstly consider the following setting to discuss the inﬂuence of default size on the
strategy selection of mining pools: the unit transaction fee α = 1×10−6 BTC , the
propagation speed ρ = 2.9 × 10−4 s/Byte, the block subsidy R = 6.25 BTC and
the average mining time T = 600 seconds, and three upper bounds of block size,
i.e., ¯B =1 MB, 2 MB and 3 MB, as well as the relative computing power of each
pool is hi ∈ (0, 1) and h1 + h2 = 1. Let us set h1 = 0.3 and h2 = 0.7 and take 0.2,
0.5 and 0.8 respectively as the initial values of xi, (i = 1, 2). Under the setting,
B∗
1 = −6.43 × 105, 6.95 ×
we get
103, 6.69 × 105 corresponding to ¯B = 1 × 106, 2 × 106, 3 × 106, respectively.

Fig.2(a), x1 converges to 1 in a relatively short time, while x2 takes much longer
time to converge to 1 shown in Fig.2(b). In addition, when x2(0) ≤ 0.5, pool
2 has a strong tendency to take B2 = ¯B initially, considering the small mining
rate of pool 1 and its own large winning probability. However, as time goes by,
pool 2 tends to realize the best response is just B∗

4.2 Conclusion

In this paper, the issue of selecting appropriate block sizes by mining pools in a
blockchain system is discussed. We model this block size determination problem
as an evolutionary game, in which each pool may follow the upper bound of
block size, i.e., the default size ¯B, or not. In addition, if a mining pool chooses
not to follow ¯B, then it shall continue to decide its optimal block size under
diﬀerent strategy proﬁle. In our evolutionary game model, all mining pools are
supposed to be bounded rational and each pool switches the low-payoﬀ strategy
to a higher one on and on by learning others’ better strategies, until the whole
network reaches an evolutionary stable state (ESS). The theoretical analysis has
been done, particularly for a case of two mining pools, we prove the existence of
diﬀerent ESS under diﬀerent conditions. In addition to verify the results in our
work, several numerical experiments by using real Bitcoin data are conducted
to show the evolutionary decisions of mining pools.

A. Proof of Lemma 2

Proof. Because g(B2) satisﬁes

we have

1 > g′(B2) =

α + λ1ρ(R + αg(B2))
2α + λ1ρ(R + αg(B2))

> 0.

(22)

So g(B2) is monotonically increasing with respect to B2. Moreover, when B2 =

d2U1(B1, 0)

dU1(B1, 0)

|B1=0 < 0.

It means that function U1(B1, 0) is strictly concave, and the maximal point g(0)
is less than 0. Let us deﬁne an auxiliary function G(B2) = g(B2) − B2. Since
g′(B2) < 1, G(B2) decreases on interval [0, ∞). Thus G(B2) ≤ G(0) < 0 for all

Let us consider the utility function of pool 1 U(B1, 0) when B2 = 0. Then

dU1(B1, 0)

= α − h2eλ1ρB1 [α + λ1ρ(R + αB1)] ≤ α[1 − h2eλ1ρB1 (2 + λ1ρB1)]

Recall that

where the ﬁrst inequality is true from the condition of
α ≤ 0, the second
one is correct due to 0 < λ1ρB1 < 1, and the last one is from the assumption
that 1/2 < h2 < 1. Therefore, U1(B1, 0) achieves its maximality at point (0, 0).
This result also veriﬁes that the conclusion that “ a miner with less mining power
prefers a smaller block size in order to optimize his payoﬀ” in [6].
