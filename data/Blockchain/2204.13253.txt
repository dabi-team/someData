Abstract—Due to the widespread use of smart contracts,
Ethereum has become the second-largest blockchain platform
after Bitcoin. Many diﬀerent types of Ethereum accounts (ICO,
Mining, Gambling, etc.) also have quite active trading activities
on Ethereum. Studying the transaction records of these speciﬁc
Ethereum accounts is very important for understanding their
particular transaction characteristics, and further labeling the
pseudonymous accounts. However, traditional methods are gen-
erally based on static and global transaction networks to conduct
research, ignoring useful information about dynamic changes.
Our work chooses six kinds of important account labels, and
builds ego networks for each kind of Ethereum account. We
focus on the interaction between the target node and neighbor
nodes with temporal analysis. Experiments show that there is a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between various types of accounts in terms
of several network features, helping us better understand their
transaction patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
work to analyze the dynamic characteristics of Ethereum labeled
accounts from the perspective of transaction ego networks.

I. INTRODUCTION

After the development of more than a decade, blockchain
technology has become a buzzword and brought world-shaking
innovations to human life. Generally speaking, blockchains are
append-only distributed ledgers originated from Bitcoin [1].
Transactions on blockchain platforms are publicly veriﬁable
based on open data architecture. Ethereum [2] is the largest
public blockchain enabling Turing-complete smart contracts,
which are computer programs that can automatically be ex-
ecuted in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Since the
outbreak of COVID-19, investors have found that Ethereum is
suitable as a short-term safe-haven [3].

Therefore, increasing research eﬀorts have been devoted to
the analysis of the publicly accessible Ethereum transaction
records. A considerable part of existing work modeled the
transaction data into networks, which are a general language
in describing interacting systems [4] [5] [6]. In the Ethereum
transaction network, an Ethereum account is regarded as a
node, and the edges between two nodes present the interactions
between the two accounts with attributes such as transaction
value, timestamp and so on.
[8]

[9] have analyzed the entire
Ethereum transaction network from a static perspective for
understanding the whole Ethereum ecosystem. They have built
several static networks using transaction data, and analyzed
network properties such as density and clustering coeﬃcients,

research [7]

Recent

comparing them with social networks and the Web. How-
ever, the daily new transaction volume of Ethereum is quite
large, and static analysis leads to the loss of insights from a
dynamic evolution perspective. Consequently, several recent
studies [10] [11] [12] provided insights into the temporal
and evolution properties of the entire Ethereum transaction
network. But there is few studies investigating the microscopic
structure of a kind of nodes in the Ethereum transaction
network, which can give explanations for the diﬀerent behav-
iors of accounts. Analyzing the Ethereum transaction network
from a perspective of various types of nodes can provide
us with a new understanding of their microscopic network
structure, which also helps to label the pseudonymous accounts
in Ethereum. In this paper, we are interested in studying the
temporal changes of multiple transaction characteristics based
on the ego network of each labeled account. The ego network
consists of the central node “EGO” and the nodes directly
connected to EGO (these are called “ALTER”), as well as
the connections between the EGO and ALTER nodes, ALTER
and ALTER nodes [13]. Ego network is widely used in social
network analysis and helps to ﬁnd many patterns [14] [15]. We
mainly select six typical Ethereum account labels, including
four normal labels (ICO, Mining, Gambling, Exchange) and
two illegal labels (Ponzi and Phish), which are collected from
Etherscan’s label word cloud1. A normal account has no illegal
activities such as deceiving users. While an illegal account
is the opposite. Then, we collect
the required transaction
records from a blockchain data platform and build multiple
ego networks. After analyzing how the transaction features
change over time for each type of node, we discover the
diﬀerent features between various types of accounts and better
understand their roles on Ethereum.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-
tion II introduces the process of collecting transaction data and
building the ego network of various accounts. The analysis of
network properties will be given in Section III. Finally, we
will give a brief conclusion in Section IV.

II. DATASET AND EXPERIMENT SETUP

In this part, we ﬁrstly introduce the source and processing
of data, and then explain the deﬁnition of ego network

constructed by using transaction data.

A. Data Collection

Etherscan is one of

recording lots of account

the most widely used Ethereum
browsers,
labels that are reli-
ably provided by multiple users. A lot of previous research
work on Ethereum also used the labeled accounts on Ether-
scan [16] [17]. We choose six types of the most common
and important accounts on Ethereum as the targets. Especially,
according to the crime report about cryptocurrency [18], ponzi
schemes and phish scams have defrauded millions of dollars.
Now we will introduce the deﬁnition of these accounts in
detail.

• ICO: The accounts used to receive crowdfunding for the

initial oﬀering of the tokens

• Mining: The accounts of miners who participate in block

mining

• Gambling: The accounts of the gambling platforms
• Exchange: The accounts of exchanges that allow users

to sell or buy cryptocurrencies

• Ponzi: The accounts related to the manipulator of ponzi

schemes

• Phish: The accounts related to the manipulator of phish

scams

In addition, we collect all target labeled accounts as well as
their complete Ether2 transaction records. In order to construct
the ego network, we also collect the transactions between their
ﬁrst-order neighbors. These transaction records are extracted
from the latest Ethereum dataset on XBlock3, which is a
blockchain data platform. Therefore, a total of 2584 accounts
and nearly 38 million transaction records are collected.

B. Construction of Ego Networks

Let G = (V, E) represents the ego network of an Ethereum
account, where V represents the set of nodes, and E is the set
of edges. V contains the central node “EGO” and its neighbor
nodes “ALTER”. The transactions between EGO and ALTER
nodes, ALTER and ALTER form the edge set E. Particularly,
an edge can be represented as e =< u, v, w, t >, indicating that
at time t, account u transfers Ether of amount w to account
v. Consequently, the ego network in our work is a weighted
directed network.

Fig. 1 shows an example of an ego network. Moreover, we
construct an ego network for each labeled account, classify the
ego networks of the same label into one category, and take the
average of various statistics as the ﬁnal feature value of the
label accounts. The details of each feature will be shown in
the next section.

III. THE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK PROPERTIES
First, we focus on the local clustering coeﬃcient of each
labeled account to determine whether the nodes in the network
are closely connected. Then we analyze several transaction

characteristics of labeled accounts. Finally, we obtain the
unique transaction features of each labeled account, which also
explain the role of the corresponding label in the Ethereum
ecosystem.

A. Local Clustering Coeﬃcient

.

(1)

τi =

The local clustering coeﬃcient is a measure of the degree
to which the neighbors of the central node in the graph tend
to cluster together. Let Gi = (V, E) represents the ego network
whose ego is node i. Here the edge of node u pointing to node
v is written as euv. Then Ni represents the neighbor nodes of
node i and ki = |Ni|. Hence the local clustering coeﬃcient of
node i is:

|{euv : u, v ∈ Ni, euv ∈ E}|
ki(ki − 1)
Then we calculate the average local clustering coeﬃcient
of each type of ego network, and the results are shown in
Table I. According to the table, the probability of transactions
occurring between the neighbors of ICO accounts is about
18%, followed by Mining accounts and Exchange accounts.
It tells us there is a higher probability that investors of ICO
accounts will have transactions with each other. The coeﬃcient
of Gambling accounts is the smallest, which means the users
participating in the gambling are generally not connected.
Besides, the local clustering coeﬃcient of Phish accounts is
larger than that of Ponzi accounts, indicating that the neighbors
of Phish accounts are also more likely to be connected.
We speculate that there are ﬁxed fraud partners in phishing
activities.

B. Ego’s Life Cycle and Time Window

For an Ethereum account u with M transactions, we deﬁne
its life cycle as Li f eu = tM − t1, where tM represents the time
when the last transaction occurred and t1 represents the time
when the ﬁrst transaction occurred. We count the life cycles
of each kind of account and record its median and maximum
values in Table II. It can be concluded that the life cycle of

illegal accounts is much shorter than that of normal accounts,
and their life cycle is less than 20 days. This is because the
criminals usually transfer the illegal gains out of the accounts
as soon as possible and no longer use the original accounts to
enhance anonymity.

Afterwards, in order to observe the ego network of each type
of label from a dynamic perspective, we refer to the previous
work [12] and consider two types of time windows, the sliding
window and the incremental window. Firstly, we take 1/5
of the life cycle of each type of labeled account as a ﬁxed
time span T , which is also the initial length of the two time
windows. The sliding distance of the sliding window is T each
time, while the size of the incremental window increases by
T . Next, we use diﬀerent time windows to extract transaction
details of the egos, and obtain diﬀerent characteristics in ﬁve
phases.

C. The number of transactions between EGOs and ALTERs
In order to study the transaction activities of diﬀerent types
of accounts, we compare the evolution in the number of
transactions between EGO and ALTER nodes during their
life cycles in the incremental window mode. It can be seen
from Fig. 2 that the number of transactions of illegal accounts
is less than that of the normal accounts. In addition,
the
number of transactions on Exchange, Mining and Gambling
accounts is relatively large. Because Exchange accounts are an
intermediary on Ethereum, they generate a lot of transactions
with users to buy and sell tokens. According to the description
on Etherscan, we can know that Mining accounts are mining
pools composed of many miners. So they usually return
bonuses to miners multiple times. Additionally, Gambling
accounts representing a kind of entertainment activity, also
attract lots of users. Signiﬁcantly, the curves of ICO accounts
and Ponzi accounts are relatively similar, which shows that
they have certain commonalities in the trading pattern. We
presume that it is one of the reasons why it’s diﬃcult for
users to distinguish whether the investment project is a scam
or not.

For the purpose of further exploring the roles of the labeled
accounts on Ethereum, the changes in the ratio of two kinds
of transactions (in/out) in the incremental window mode are
also recorded. An in-transaction is an interaction in which the
EGO receives Ether, and an out-transaction is an interaction
in which the EGO transfers Ether to another account.

The results in Table III show that only Mining, Ex-
change, and Ponzi accounts have a higher proportion of out-
transactions than in-transactions. We suppose that the reasons
for this phenomenon are as follows. Firstly,
the rewards
obtained from mining blocks will be distributed to users who

invest
in miners, which is a long-term stable mechanism.
Secondly, when an Exchange account is used as the initiator
of transactions, it means that users are buying Ether from
this platform. Generally speaking, investors will continue to
purchase Ether multiple times and then sell them all at the
highest price point. And thus Exchange accounts have more
in-transactions than out-transactions. Thirdly, a Ponzi account
intends to act like a normal project at ﬁrst to attract more
people. Then, a small part of the investment of latecomers will
also be used as bonuses to return to the initial users several
times.

Moreover, the in-transaction ratio of ICO accounts is rela-
tively large at the initial phase of token issuance, and the later
transaction volume gradually decreases. The other two kinds
of accounts with a higher proportion of in-transactions are
Gambling and Phish. A gambling activity is a game where the
dealer makes a proﬁt, so the number of users who win money
is less than the total number of participants. Phish accounts
are fraudulent, so they deceive multiple users to obtain Ether,
and then transfer out all the illegal gains at the ﬁnal phase.

D. The amount of transactions between EGO and ALTER

Besides the number of transactions, the transaction amount
is also an extremely important feature. Therefore, we observe
the transfer amount of Ethereum accounts at each phase in the

sliding window mode, and analyze the diﬀerence and essence.
It can be seen from Fig. 3 that ICO accounts initially receive
a large amount of investment and then gradually transfer it
to the token-related accounts. Interestingly, the total amount
transferred out from Mining accounts is always greater than
the total amount transferred in, because most of the balance
in the accounts comes from mining rewards. These rewards
are not be recorded in the transactions, but
they can be
queried through the Ethereum browser. In addition, when no
player participates in gambling games, Gambling accounts will
transfer the balance out, indicating that Gambling accounts are
essentially a proﬁtable entity. In general, only the transfer-in
and transfer-out amount at all phases of Exchange accounts are
basically the same, which also reﬂects the role of Exchange
accounts as an intermediary for the sale of tokens. Finally,
we ﬁnd that both types of illegal accounts have reaped
huge proﬁts, which means it’s urgent to identify and combat
fraudulent accounts on Ethereum. It is worth noting that Phish
accounts usually transfer out a large amount of Ether in the
ﬁnal phase. While Ponzi accounts transfer Ether out in batches,
and some Ether will be returned to investors.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

With the rapid development of Ethereum, a large number
of accounts on Ethereum have involved in various business
roles. For exploring the transaction behavior of these accounts
and obtaining a more comprehensive description of their roles
in the Ethereum ecosystem, we used transaction records to
construct multiple ego networks with transaction amount and

time information for each type of account. By analyzing the
dynamic changes of the interaction characteristics of EGO
(labeled accounts) and ALTER (ﬁrst-order neighbor accounts),
we found that the trading of Mining accounts and Exchange
accounts is more stable. In addition, the two illegal accounts,
Ponzi and Phish, also have obvious abnormalities in the ratio
of the amount of in/out transactions. The dynamic changes of
transaction characteristics also enabled us to label unknown
accounts. Most of all, we understood the evolutionary phases
of scams, which can provide some help in identifying fraud-
ulent activities on Ethereum.

In the future, we will continue to expand our research
by investigating more network properties in the dynamic
transaction network, such as transaction objects and network
motifs. We expect the corresponding results to tell us whether
there is a speciﬁc transaction rule and help us discover hidden
communities in the network. Furthermore, we will consider
more account labels, and more dynamic changes in complex
network characteristics.
