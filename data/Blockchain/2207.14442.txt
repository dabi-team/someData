Abstract:  Future  Generation  Computer  Systems  (FGCS),  published  by  Elsevier,  is  a 
prestigious peer reviewed journal that started in 1984. As on date of writing this article, the 
journal  is  in  its  137th  volume.  Owing  to  its  publication  quality  and  continued  academic 
standards, it has been indexed by major academic databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, 
DOAJ etc. It is now ranked among the top journals in the area of Computer Science (General). 
Motivated  by  the  long  history,  academic  reputation  and  prestige  of  the  journal,  the  present 
study attempts to do a bibliometric and text-based analysis of publications in the journal during 
the period of 1984-2020 (37 years). Bibliometric analysis helped to  identify publishing  and 
citation  patterns,  authorship  and  collaboration  structure,  funding  patterns  of  the  published 
research, open access and altmetric impact, gender distribution and SDG connections etc. The 
text-integrated  path  analysis  helped  in  identifying  the  thematic  structure  and  major  concept 
evolution  trajectories.  The  results  of  the  analysis  indicate  that  the  FGCS  journal  is  a  high-
quality  research  journal  that  has  grown  over  time  in  terms  of  publications,  citations  and 
rankings. It publishes articles in specified thematic areas, with cloud, grid, IoT, Blockchain etc. 
found as the major themes addressed. Knowledge extension from cloud computing to multi-
domain networks is witnessed and a divergence towards ‘service function chains’, ‘distributed 
machine  learning’  and  ‘edge  computing  systems’  is  visible.  The  article  thus  presents  very 
informative and useful insight about research publication trends in FGCS.

According to Scopus, it  is ranked in the 97th, 98th and 99th percentile in Computer Science- 
Software (10th rank out of 398), Computer Science- Computer Networks & Communication 
(5th out of 359) and Computer Science- Hardware & Architecture (2nd out of 167), respectively. 
It has a cite score of 18.7 and  a Scimago Journal Rank (SJR) of 2.233 (Q1) as in 2021. Its 
Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) is 2.699 in 2021. According to the latest Google 
Scholar Metrics of 2022, it is ranked 2nd in Computing Systems, a subcategory of Engineering 
and Computer Science journals, with an h5 index of 133 and h5 median of 197.  

Motivated  by  the  long  history,  academic  reputation  and  prestige  of  the  journal,  the  present 
study attempts to do a bibliometric and text-based analysis of publications in the journal during 
the period of 1984-2020 (37 years). To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has tried 
to analyse the publication patterns, authorship and citation trends, and thematic trajectories of 
publications  in  the  journal.  Therefore,  this  study  attempts  to  do  a  systematic  bibliometric 
analysis of the publications in the journal to understand the publication, citation, authorship, 
gender distribution, open access and social media visibility trends. In addition, it dives deep 
into the major evolutionary trajectories of the thematic focus of the publications in the journal, 
as captured by the ‘Text-integrated Path Analysis (TPA)’ method. The analysis is thus divided 
into two parts. The first part presents useful insights about bibliometric patterns and trends. 
The second part uncovers the thematic trajectories seen in the publications in the journal.  

The  bibliometric  exercise  presents  useful  analysis  and  insights  about  the  following  major 
aspects:   

•  Publication volume and annual trends and growth during 1984-2020, 
•  The citation impact of publications in the journal, 
•  Top contributing countries and institutions that contributed publications in FGCS, 
•  Authorship structure and international collaboration patterns in publications in FGCS, 
•  Gender distribution of publications in FGCS, 
•  Funded and Non-funded research published in FGCS, 
•  Open access availability of publications in FGCS, 
•  Social media visibility of publications in FGCS on different platforms, and 
•  Connect of FGCS publications with the Sustainable Development Goals. 

The Text-integrated Path Analysis performs a network and text-based analysis and provides 
insights about following major things: 

•  Key developmental trajectories within the body of knowledge represented by FGCS, 
•  Evolution  of  key  concepts  related  to  the  fields  that  are  associated  with  the  journal 

FGCS, 

•  Some  key  application  areas  in  which  the  specific  developments  (that  are  identified 
based  on  the  network  mining  exercise  through  path  analysis)  disseminated  through 
FGCS can make a difference, 

•  Technological  evolution  in  those  key  application  areas  associated  with  the  body  of 

knowledge represented by FGCS, 

•  Knowledge  and  technological  evolution  through  convergences  and  divergences 

between the core areas and application areas, and    

•  Technologies  that  can  bring  paradigm  shift  and  revolutionize  immediate  and 

indirect/more generic application areas of FGCS 

 
The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the Data and Methodology 
used  for  the  analytical  exercise.  Section  3  presents  results  about  different  aspects  of 
bibliometric analysis. Section 4 presents results of Text-integrated Path Analysis. The paper 
concludes in Section 5 with a summary of the work done and the key conclusions obtained.   

2. Data and Method 

The data for analysis corresponds to publications in the FGCS journal during 1984 to 2020 and 
was  obtained  from  the  Dimensions  database  through  a  subscription-based  api  access. 
Dimensions database is known to have many advantages for bibliometric analysis and has been 
found useful for bibliometric analysis, in various respects [1], [2]. A total of 5,754 publication 
records  were  retrieved.  The  complete  metadata  comprising  the  publication  records  was 
downloaded  and  processed.  The  major  fields  used  for  analysis  were  ‘doi’,  ‘year’,  ‘id’, 
‘authors_count’,  ‘authors’,  ‘research_orgs’,  ‘research_org_countries’,  ‘referenced_pubs’, 
‘open_access’, ‘category_for’, ‘category_sdg’, ‘concepts_scores’, ‘times_cited’, ‘funders’ etc. 
Out of these, the ‘open_access’ field provides evidence about open access availability of the 
article. The ‘category_for’ field provides the subject classification of the publication according 
to a predefined scheme. The ‘concept_scores’ field lists important concepts (with relevance 
score) of a publication extracted from its full-text using machine learning algorithms. Other 
metadata fields are the standard fields used in a bibliometric analysis.  

The data for social media activity around publications in  FGCS  was obtained from  popular 
Altmetric aggregator Altmetric.com. The subscription-based access of Altmetric.com API was 
used for the purpose. It crawls over different social media, news, and blog platforms to collect 
views,  mentions,  comments  etc.  around  a  scholarly  article.  The  Altmetric.com  provides  the 
mentions of publication DOIs on various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, 
Wikipedia,  Blogs  etc.  The  DOIs  of  the  publication  data  in  FGCS  journal  were  passed  to 
Altmetric  Explorer  and  the  data  corresponding  to  publications  was  obtained.  Out  of  5,754 
publication records that were passed to Altmetric.com, it returned data for 1,710 publications, 
indicating that altmetric data is available only for publications in the recent decade.  

2.1 Bibliometric, Altmetric and Gender Distribution Analysis 

The  present  study  uses  a  combination  of  standard  bibliometric  approach,  network  theoretic 
approach and text analysis-based approach for mapping the bibliometric patterns and thematic 
structure of the publications in FGCS. A bibliometric study of a journal is a popular approach 
for identifying the trends of the journal in terms of topics, contributing institutions, authorship 
structure  and  highly  cited  papers  etc.  Several  previous  studies  have  adopted  a  bibliometric 
analysis approach for understanding publication patterns and thematic structure of a journal 
[3], [4], [5], [6]. 

For performing bibliometric analysis, a set of standard procedures were implemented in Python 
programming language. Basic indicators and results such as publication counts, citation impact, 
authorship structure, collaboration trends, funding patterns, etc were computed. Additionally, 
results  such  as  top  contributing  countries  and  institutions,  open  access  visibility  and 
publications classified under Sustainable Development Goals were also computed. 

The  altmetric  analysis  for  publications  from  FGCS  was  carried  out  by  analysing  the  data 
obtained from Altmetric.com. This service provides 46 fields in the data, including DOI, Title, 
Twitter mentions, Facebook mentions, News mentions, Altmetric Attention Score, OA Status, 

 
  
 
Subjects  (FoR), Publication Date, URI, etc. Out  of this, mainly  data for Twitter, Facebook, 
News, Blog, Wikipedia and Mendeley platforms was analysed. The coverage percentage and 
average mentions per paper was identified.  

In  addition  to  standard  bibliometric  and  altmetric  patterns,  the  gender  distribution  in 
publications of FGCS was also identified. For this purpose, the service of gender-api was used. 
The  name  of  the  first  author  of  each  publication  along  with  affiliating  country  name  was 
extracted  from  publication data and passed to  gender-api.  The service  returns the identified 
gender of the author with an accuracy score. For this study, an accuracy value above 70% has 
been considered acceptable. The obtained gender information for the publications was used to 
plot the year-wise gender distribution of authors. 

A  diagrammatic  representation  of  the  complete  methodology  for  analysis,  comprising  of 
Bibliometric, Altmetric, Gender Distribution and Path Analysis steps of the FGCS publications 
is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 Text-integrated Path Analysis (TPA) 

Text-integrated path analysis is a methodology developed by combined usage of path analysis 
and text analysis. Firstly, the path analysis methodology is discussed in detail. 

Path Analysis 

Complex network analysis offers a multitude of methods and tools for addressing wide range 
of problems in real-world systems that can be modelled as networks. Networks are basically 
graphs (that consists of vertices that represent  entities and their relationships represented as 
interconnections/links)  and  information/attributes  related  to  both  the  vertices  and  links. 
Scientific  and  technological  (patent)  literature  is  two  such  systems  that  consists  of  several 
relationship between entities such as works (papers or patents), authors/inventors, institutional 
affiliations/assignees, etc.  One of the major relationships is citations, where for a pair of works, 
the latest work cites previous related work. This results in the formation of scientific citations 
network  or  citation  network  of  scholarly  publications/papers  [7],  [8]  and  patent  citation 
networks or citation networks of patents. Centrality analysis, path analysis and cluster analysis 
are three major kinds of analyses possible in network analysis that can be dubbed as the network 
analysis  trio.  Among  these,  path  analysis  helps  to  identify  the  important  evolutionary 
trajectories or connective threads of knowledge [9]. Path analysis has been used by many for 
determining important evolutionary paths that might have served as backbone of development 
of different fields. Few examples are evolutionary trajectory study for medical technologies 
[10], ‘Coronary  angioplasty’ [11], human resource development  [12] and  archaeology  [13], 
etc. Despite its  benefits,  when it comes to  methodical  development,  path  analysis remained 
underexplored among the network analysis trio. 

Citation  networks  are  by  default  unweighted.  Path  analysis  consists  of  two  major  steps-  (i) 
weight assignment or conversion of unweighted network into weighted network and (ii) search 
or  trace  through  the  weighted  network  to  retrieve  paths.  Original  Hummon  &  Dorain 
framework [9] used traversal as the basis of weight assignment of arcs (directed citation links) 
for the creation of weighted network. They introduced SPLC (Search Path Link Count) and 
SPNP (Search Path Node Pair) as two weight assignment methods. Regarding search schemes, 
Forward Search and Critical path method were used for retrieving important evolutionary paths 
in the network. After this, a break-through in path analysis literature was brought-in by [14] 
when  computationally  efficient  traversal-based  weight  assignment  method  namely  SPC 
(Search Path Count) method was introduced. Generally, the traversal-based weight assignment 
schemes  can  be  termed  together  as  SPX  schemes.  A  major  development  in  search  scheme 
happened  with  the  introduction  of  search  schemes  like  backward  search,  key-route  search, 
global search, etc., with a provision for tolerance. These schemes, especially multiple key-route 
search,  empowered  the  ability  of  path  analysis  to  retrieve  more  important  evolutionary 
trajectories in scientific literature. However, due to the dependency on SPX methods on the 
global structure of the network, in a connected component, highly (SPX) weighted arcs seem 
to clutter together, thereby limiting the effectiveness of multiple keyroute search to retrieve 
multiple paths. In order to address this limitation, [15] introduced a novel weight assignment 
method,  namely  the  Flow  Vergence  (FV)  gradient  method  for  weight  assignment  and  also 
upgrading  the  Liu-Lu  approach  [16].  with  state-of-the-art  integrated  framework  in  path 
analysis. With the framework of [15], if we use SPX and FV gradient as weight assignment 
methods, and existing search schemes, following paths can be retrieved: SPX-forward paths, 
SPX-backward  paths,  SPX-keyroute  paths,  SPX-critical  paths,  FV-forward  paths,  FV-
backward paths, FV-keyroute paths and FV-critical paths. In this work, we use SPC (among 
SPX)  weight  assignment  and  therefore  the  retrieved  paths  will  be  SPC-forward  path,  SPC-

backward path, SPC-keyroute path, SPC-critical path, FV-forward path,  FV-backward path, 
FV-keyroute path and FV-critical path. 

Brief description of SPC and FV gradient weight assignment and search schemes are given 
below: 

SPC method: A short revisit 

As mentioned earlier, SPC method is one of the weight assignment methods that belong to the 
SPX genre (traversal-based weight assignment methods) developed by [14] In SPC method, 
identification of all sources and sinks in the citation network is the first task. Then, for each arc 
in  the  network,  the  number  of  search  paths  (from  sources  to  sinks)  passing  through  it  is 
computed and such a count is assigned as weight of that arc. 

FV gradient method: A short revisit 

Scientific  citation  network,  a  kind  of  information  network  is  an  interconnected  structure  of 
scholarly publications which are linked through citation links or arc of citations.  These links 
can be treated as a representation of the flow of information from the cited work to the citing 
work. Most of the vertex measures if used independently fails to reflect one important property 
of a vertex (work) in a citation network that arises due to the flow of information through it, 
namely the flow vergence (FV). Flow of information through a paper invokes a dominance in 
terms of flow convergence or flow divergence, which can be termed as flow vergence by [17]. 
Flow vergence potential is the potential of a paper to contribute to the growth of a field via the 
attainment or improvement of flow divergence dominance. Thus, works which are presently in 
knowledge  flow  divergence  mode  can  be  surely  regarded  as  works  of  high  flow  vergence 
potential. Even though a work is not presently in flow divergence mode, certain works can be 
treated  as  of  high  FV  potential.  This  happens  only  if  that  work  succeeded  in  delivering 
knowledge to other works (that cites the concerned work) that are at certain level of quality 
which is reflected by eigenvector centrality ([18]). This concept was introduced by [17] and an 
index for reflecting the flow vergence potential was also developed. Flow Vergence index or 
FV index of a paper i can be computed as: 

                                                       𝑊𝐹𝑉𝑖   =  

𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑖−𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑖
𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑖+𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑖
where,  𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑖,  𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑖 and  𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑖 are  the  indegree  (the  number  of  citations  received),  the 
outdegree (number of citations made) and eigenvector centrality of paper i in the network [19]. 
Now, we move on to discuss the FV gradient method as the theoretical origin and rationale 
behind the formulation of the FV index is already covered by [15], [17], [20], [21], and [22].  

  +   𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑖                                       (1) 

Since a citing-cited pair is related by knowledge flow, existence of flow vergence potential for 
citing and cited work also implies the existence of flow vergence gradient or gradient in flow 
vergence potential between them.  The potential difference between works i and j connected 
by an arc of citation from j to i can be termed as FV gradient ([20]) and it can be computed as: 

                                                               ∆𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑗 =        𝑊𝐹𝑉𝑖 −  𝑊𝐹𝑉𝑗                                      (2) 

The  speciality  of  the  of  FV  gradient  or  the  FV  potential  difference  is  that,  usually,  the 
knowledge flow tends to appear as to have occurred from a work of high FV potential to a work 
of low FV potential. Thus, in most of the cases, ∆𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑗 takes a positive value. However, in some 
special cases, when newer works (citing works) tend to outperform the former ones (cited ones) 
due  to  its  intellectual  merit  or  innovative  appeal  to  the  scientific  community,  we  can  have 
∆𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑗   <  0,  making  knowledge  flow  to  occur  from  low  potential  paper  to  a  high  potential 
paper. This phenomenon was termed as Flow Vergence effect or FV effect and was used to 
detect [20] and predict [22] pivot papers of paradigm shift. Computation of FV gradients makes 

the network a signed weighted network and hence FV gradient method of weight assignment 
helps for the retrieval of paths that might not be highlighted through SPX methods. To ensure 
that the arcs with negative signs are not missed and given high priority when certain search 
schemes like key-route search are employed, the following transformation of eqn. (2) should 
be done. 

∆𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑗(𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚. ) =   1 +

𝑚𝑎𝑥.∆𝐹𝑉−∆𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑗 
𝑚𝑎𝑥.∆𝐹𝑉−𝑚𝑖𝑛.∆𝐹𝑉

                                      (3) 

Where, 𝑚𝑎𝑥. ∆𝐹𝑉 is the highest FV gradient weight in the network and 𝑚𝑖𝑛. ∆𝐹𝑉 is the lowest 
FV gradient weight in the network. 

Search Schemes 

Forward Search: In forward search, among all the arcs originating from all the sources (the 
papers that do not cite any other paper but get at least one citation), the ones with highest weight 
will be selected. The target node of that arc will be made the new source and the same procedure 
will be repeated in a greedy fashion till sink papers (the papers that do not get cited yet but has 
cited at least one paper) are found. When there are ties, both the arcs will be considered. 

Backward Search: In backward search, unlike the forward search, search originates from sink 
papers till source papers are obtained. Everything is same as that of forward search. This was 
introduced by [16]. 

Global search/Critical path method: In global search method, instead of selecting an initial 
arc and its subsequent arcs in a greedy or ‘local best’ fashion, for all the source-sink paths, the 
total weight of the path (which is equal to the sum of weights of all the arcs that forms that 
path) will be computed and the highest among that will be considered as the critical path.  

Key-route Search (Local): In key-route search (local), instead of initiating search from source 
or sink (which invokes the risk of missing the highest weighted arc in the network), search 
commences from the terminal nodes of key-route (the highest weighted arc). From cited work 
of the key-route, search proceeds as that in backward search till source is obtained and from 
citing work of the key-route, search proceeds in the manner of forward search till sink is found. 
This search scheme is the key innovation of Liu-Lu approach. This search can be conducted to 
retrieve  multiple  paths  with  the  selection  of  multiple  key-routes.  For  instance,  the  software 
package PAJEK () has set the option 1-10 as default choice, by which top 10 key-routes will 
be selected for the search. This choice can be changed by users accordingly. 

Key-route Search (global): In key-route (global), instead of tracing from both the terminal 
nodes  of  key-routes  till  sources  and  sinks  are  approached,  a  global  search  is  initiated  from 
terminal nodes of key-routes. That means, from all the paths reachable from citing paper and 
cited paper in the key-route, the ones with largest sum of weights will be chosen. 

Along  with  these  search  schemes,  a  provision  for  tolerance  is  also  proposed  by  [16]  and 
available in PAJEK for local search schemes such as forward, backward and key-route (local). 
If a tolerance of 10% (0.1 is the default value set in PAJEK) is selected, at each step, instead 
of choosing the largest weighted arc, all the arcs that falls with-in 90% of its weight will be 
selected.    

Text-integration for Path Analysis 

Once, important paths (which are subnetworks of citation network) in the concerned literature 
are  identified,  nodes  of  the  paths  (i.e.,  papers)  should  be  relabelled  or  current  vertex  labels 
should be replaced by terms or words that best represent the theme/contribution of that paper. 

 
In Dimensions, since each published article is associated with ‘concepts’ that represent certain 
keywords that represent the relation of work with the subfield/field in which the work belongs 
to,  the  relabelling  can  be  easily  achieved  by  mapping  the  work’s  label/id  with  the  concept. 
Also, since each concept are associated with a relevance score or score of relevance, selection 
of  the  best  representative  word  can  also  be  systematically  done  with  ease.  Thus,  the  paths 
obtained after TPA can be termed as ‘Concept Evolution Paths’. The methodology used for 
text-integrated path analysis (TPA) is given below: 

Procedure for extraction of Concept evolution Paths

Notes: TP - Total Publications in a Year; TC- Total Citations; CPP – TP/TC; Cited %- Publications having >0 
citations 

It is observed that during the given period (1984 to 2020), the number of publications grew by 
a factor of 45, starting from 18 publications in 1984 and reaching to 820 publications in 2020. 
The  growth  in  number  of  publications  during  the  first  decade  was,  however,  slower  as 
compared to later periods. A steady increase in publication counts was noticed for the recent 
decade (growing from 150 publications in 2010 to 820 publications in 2020). The AGR is found 

 
 
to vary from 27.78% during initial period to 152.23% in 2017-2018. High AGRs were observed 
during 1988-1989 (152.63%), 1991-1992 (294.44%) and 2017-2018 (152.23%). However, the 
number of publications also experienced a decline in few time periods. For example, a decrease 
of more than 40% in publication count was observed during the time periods of 1987-1988 (-
52.5%),  1990-1991  (-50%),  1992-1993  (-47.89%),  1995-1996  (-54.24%)  and  2014-2015  (-
43.46%).  However,  in  overall  terms,  the  publications  in  FGCS  have  grown  with  an  overall 
CAGR of 10.87%. 

Next, the citation patterns of publications in FGCS are analysed. In the scientific community, 
citations  are  an  important  indicator  of  the  impact  of  publications  produced  by  researchers, 
institutions  as  well  as  countries  [23].  They  account  for  the  scientific  impact  of  a  journal  in 
which the publications are published. An overview of citation impact of publications in FGCS 
can be seen in Table 1. Various indicators, namely TC (Total Citations), CPP (Citation per 
paper given by TC/TP), Cited% (percentage of publications having at-least 1 citation) and h-
index of the journal are computed and shown. It can be observed that during the initial phase 
of the journal, a steady increase in total citation count was recorded, growing from 56 in 1984 
to 256 in 1988. The CPP grew from 3.11 in 1984 to 13.47 in 1988. In the subsequent years, 
very low CPP values were observed, which ultimately spiked to 34.18 in 1997. Since it is a 
ratio of TC to TP, it will tend to decrease with fewer citations and more publications. Similarly, 
it will tend to increase with more citations and fewer publications, thus directly implicating the 
high  quality  and  importance  of  these  few  publications.  When  TC  and  TP  go  up  or  down 
together, it does not affect much change in CPP. CPP value of greater than 50 was observed 
for the years 2009 (60.92), 2012 (54.01) and 2013 (67.35). In these years, the publications were 
relatively less but  they obtained a good number of citations. The growing  popularity of the 
journal could also be noticed the fact that since 1996 more than 70% of the articles received at 
least one or more citations. The h-index of the journal computed for the whole period is 142, 
indicating that there are at least 142 papers, each of which attracted 142 or more citations.  

3.2 Top Contributing Countries and Institutions 

The bibliometric analysis is further continued to identify the major countries and institutions 
that  contributed  research  publications  to  FGCS.  Table  2  presents  the  top  ten  contributing 
countries  to  the  FGCS  journal  during  1984  to  2020.  China  accounts  for  majority  of  the 
publications  (1,434)  and  citations  (29,335)  in  the  journal.  United  States  is  at  2nd  place  in 
publications (1,068) and citations (26,944). Though China and United States accounted for the 
maximum  number  of  publications  and  citations  accrued,  the  highest  CPP  value  of  60.95  is 
observed  for  Australia  which  had  only  427  publications  in  FGCS.  India  which  stood  at  9th 
position in publications with 286 publications accounted for the 2nd highest CPP value of 33.02 
after Australia.  

Table 3 shows the list of top ten contributing institutions to FGCS journal. Out of these ten 
institutions, four belong to China. There are two institution each from Australia and Italy each. 
Out of the top ten institutions, the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (China), 
King Saud University (Saudi Arabia) and University of Amsterdam (Netherlands) have each 
contributed  more  than  100  papers.  The  Huazhong  University  of  Science  and  Technology 
(China) is at the 1st position among contributing institutions with 122 papers in FGCS. It can 
be observed that the University of Melbourne (Australia) has the highest number of citations 
accrued, with a very good CPP value of 227.24. University of Naples Federico II from Italy 
gathered the 2nd highest number of citations with just 52 publications.

3.3 Top Cited and Citing Sources  

The identification of top cited and top citing sources is the next step in bibliometric analysis. 
Table  4  presents  the  list  of  top  25  cited  sources  (journals)  and  the  top  25  citing  sources 
(journals)  for  FGCS.  It  can  be  observed  that  the  publications  in  FGCS  frequently  cite  the 
articles  published  in  Future  Generation  Computer  Systems,  Lecture  Notes  in  Computer 
Science, 
IEEE  Transactions  on  Parallel  and  Distributed  Systems,  IEEE  Access, 
Communications of the ACM, Concurrency Computation Practice and Experience and IEEE 
Communications Magazine etc. Similarly, the publications in FGCS are cited quite frequently 
by  the  papers  published  in  IEEE  Access,  Future  Generation  Computer  Systems,  Sensors, 
Concurrency and Computation Practice Experience, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Journal 
of Supercomputing, Multimedia Tools and Applications, Cluster Computing etc. It can be seen 
that the citing sources are a bit more diverse than the cited sources in terms of their thematic 
focus. Thus, the publications in FGCS may be seen as contributing to research in other areas 
too. The list of top cited and citing sources thus provides a good indication of the trends of 
citation outflow and inflow for FGCS.

3.4 Authorship Structure  

A global shift is seen from individualistic to team science [24], [25]. Further, the acceptance 
rate  of  publications  involving  collaborations  among  multiple  authors  has  been  found  to  be 
higher than single authored ones [26], [27]. Therefore, we tried to see the authorship structure 
of publications in FGCS over the years. Figure 2 presents the year-wise authorship structure 
of publications in FGCS. The plot reveals that while single authored publications have been 
dominant in the early years of the journal (with more than 70% papers being single authored), 
the number of single authored papers has decline to even less than 10% in the recent years. The 
papers with 2-5 authors are now seen to be the most popular type, accounting for over 70% 
papers in the year 2020. Similarly, papers with 6-10 authors and 10+ authors being negligible 
till about  1990, show a  rise in  volume. The papers with  6-10 authors  are about  20% in  the 
recent years. Publications with 10+ authors, however, remain very small, with less than 5% of 
the total publications. The authorship structure observed shows a clear pattern of shift from 
single  authored  to  multi-authored  papers  in  the  journal.  Interestingly,  the  papers  with  6-10 
authors now constitute over 20% of the publication volume in the FGCS journal.

3.5 Institutional and International Collaboration 

It is well-known that research involving collaboration, especially international collaboration, 
benefits both the researchers and organizations and leads to research with higher impact. [28], 
[29].  Keeping  this  in  mind,  we  have  tried  to  find  identify  what  proportion  of  FGCS  multi-
authored  publications  involve  collaboration  between  authors  from  the  same  institution 
(Domestic  -  Single  Institution),  authors  from  different  institutions  from  a  single  country 
(Domestic – Multi Institution) and authors from multiple institutions from different countries 
(Internationally  Collaborated  Papers  (ICP)).  The  research_org_countries  field  in  the 

 
 
 
publication data was analysed for this purpose. Figure 3 presents the proportion of Domestic- 
Single Institution, Domestic- Multi Institution and ICP papers in FGCS over the period of time 
from 1984 to 2020. It can be observed that during the initial years, majority of the publications 
(about  80%)  are  Domestic-  Single  Institution  type.    However,  after  the  year  2004,  the  ICP 
proportion  crossed  20%  mark  and  has  increased  continuously  thereafter.  During  the  years 
2015-2020,  ICP  proportion  has  reached  to  over  40%  level.  It  is  in  this  same  duration,  that 
maximum  number  of  citations  were  accrued  by  the  journal’s  publications.  This  could  be 
attributed to the increase in internationally collaborated papers during this time.  

A  look  at  the  papers  contributed  as  a  part  of  domestic  collaborations  i.e.  publications  from 
single and multiple institutions reveals that the single institution papers occupied a high volume 
during the initial years of the journal, however their proportion declined after 2004. On the 
other hand, a rise in papers published as a result of collaboration among institutions from the 
same country increased from 1994 onwards. However, this increase remained moderate and 
gradual  during  the  years.  In  the  most  recent  years,  about  over  20  papers  are  examples  of 
Domestic- Multi Institution type.

3.6 Funded Publications and Funding Agencies 

The publication metadata of publications in FGCS was analysed next to find out how many 
publications have associated funding, and which are the top funding agencies for such research. 
Table 5 presents a list of major funding sources along with number of funded publications. It 
can be seen that the Chinese funding agency- National Natural Science Foundation of China- 
have highest number of funded publications in FGCS. Out of top ten funding agencies, three 
are from China. The remaining agencies in the list are from United States, Spain, South Korea 
etc.  The  European  Commission,  Belgium  is  the  second  largest  contributor  of  funded 
publications.

3.7 Open access availability 

The institutions across countries have been increasingly participating in open access publishing 
[30]. The availability of open access publications enhances greater participation in science for 
various audiences such as authors, researchers, funders etc. [31]. More so it is beneficial for 
developing and under-developed countries whose research fraternity may not have sufficient 
resources to pay for journal subscription charges [32]. There are different routes to open access, 
such  as  Gold,  Green,  Bronze  etc.  [33].  Owing  to  importance  of  open  access  availability  of 
articles, several previous studies have tried to measure the extent and the type of open access 
publishing occurring at the level of a whole country too [34], [35]. Motivated by this, we have 
tried to analyzed the trend and pattern of open access availability of publications from FGCS. 
Figure 4 presents year-wise trend of openly available artciles from FGCS. In the initial years, 
very  few  publications  are  available  in  open  access.  However,  during  the  more  recent  time, 
about  20  to  30%  articles  are  found  to  be  available  in  some  form  of  open  access.  The 
publications for the year 2016 show the peak of about  30% of the publications  available in 
open access. Figure 5 presents the distribution of openly available publications under different 
types.  It can be observed that majority of the openly available publications (about 83%) are 
available in green form of open access. This is followed by 9% in bronze open access and 8% 
in hybrid open access form. Thus, there is an increase over the years in openly available articles 
from FGCS, which is now between 20 to 30% of the total articles published in FGCS.

3.8 Gender distribution of research publications 

The gender distribution in research publishing is now a very important aspect in quantitative 
studies of science. Several studies have tried to determine the gender distribution in research 
either at the level of a country [36], [37] or a discipline [38]. Motivated by this, we have also 

 
 
 
 
 
tried to understand the gender distribution pattern of research publications from FGCS.  The 
metadata for publication records, mainly the author names, have been analysed to find out what 
proportion of papers in FGCS are male first authored and what proportion of papers are female 
first authored. For this purpose, the service of gender-api was used, as described in the ‘Data 
and method’ section. The author names (along with country name) are passed to gender-api, 
which returns the determined gender for the author name with an accuracy score. The results 
for  which  a  70%  accuracy  value  is  obtained  are  accepted  as  valid  determination  of  author 
gender. This information is then used to plot the year-wise gender distribution of papers, as 
seen in Figure 6. It can be seen that during the initial years, male first authored publications 
were high with almost negligible percentage of female first authored publications. However, 
the proportion of female first authored publication has rose after that, more specifically since 
the year 2000. While the female first authored publications were only 14.04% in 2000, it grew 
to  a  level  of  up  to  20.09%  in  2020.  Thus,  there  is  a  growth  seen  in  female  first  authored 
publications in FGCS, more specifically during the recent years.

3.9 Social Media visibility of research publications 

During the recent years, altmetric has emerged as an alternative measure of impact of research 
publications [39], [40], [41]. It tries to measure the activity around research articles in social 
media and academic social networks etc. [42]. Altmetrics has gained popularity more during 
the last decade. We have tried to measure the altmetric activity around research publications in 
FGCS by obtaining the data from popular altmetric aggregator, Altmetric.com [43], [44]. Since 

 
 
 
the altmetric is a recent phenomenon, we have tried to measure the altmetric activity only for 
the recent period of 2011 to 2020. The publication DOI is passed on the Altmetric.com, which 
returns the tracked altmetric data from different platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, News 
Mediums,  Blog  Platforms,  Wikipedia  and  Mendeley  etc.  Table  5  presents  the  coverage 
percentage and average mentions per paper in different platforms for the FGCS publications.    

It was found that out of 3,862 publication records in FGCS during 2011-20, a total of 1,274 are 
found covered by Altmetric.com, which is 32.98% coverage. Table 6 presents the coverage 
and average mentions per paper for FGCS articles in different platforms. Mendeley has highest 
coverage (32.91%) and average mentions per paper value (91.69) among all platforms. Twitter 
platform has coverage of 550 articles (14,24% coverage) with average tweets per paper of 4.18. 
Facebook, News and Blog platforms have relatively lower values. The coverage and average 
mentions per paper values are, however, similar to those observed in studies for many other 
reputed journals in Computer Science.

3.10 SDG Connection of the publications 

The  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  also  referred  to  as  the  Global  Goals,  were 
adopted by the United Nations in 2015. There are a total of 17 goals along with 169 indicators 
which are targeted to be achieved by 2030. These goals are focussed on overall human well-
being (they address issues like affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, 
climate action, good health and well-being etc.). Achieving these goals require research and 
development and hence contribution of researchers across the world is very important [45]. It 
has been reported that the research publications related to SDGs have been increasing widely 
[46]. Studies like [47] and [48] have analysed the technology-oriented publications related to 
SDGs. FGCS is an important future oriented journal and hence is expected to be publishing 
research and technological advancements in the area of SDGs. Motivated by this, we have tried 
to identify what number of papers in FGCS are related to some SDG. Identifying whether a 
publication is related to a SDG is a challenge. Fortunately, the Dimensions database provides 

 
 
an  automated  classification  of  the  articles  in  different  SDG(s)  based  on  the  content  of  the 
research articles. Therefore, we used this information to map which publications from FGCS 
are related to one or more SDGs. Figure 7 presents a tree map of the publications from FGCS 
classified  under  different  SDGs.  It  can  be  observed  that  the  Goal  7  (Affordable  and  Clean 
Energy), Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and Goal 3 (Good health and well-
being) have maximum number of publications classified under them. These areas have 355, 64 
and  54  papers,  respectively.  The  results  indicate  that  FGCS  publishes  a  good  amount  of 
research  publications  on  research  and  technological  advancements  in  Affordable  and  Clean 
Energy,  Sustainable  Cities  and  Communities  and  Good  health  and  Well-being.  This  is  an 
indication of future alignment and forward-looking scope and agenda of the FGCS journal.

4. Text-integrated Path Analysis 

4.1 Evolution of Concepts: Insights from text-integrated Path Analysis  

The first step is creation of citation network of publications in FGCS. This network is found to 
be consisting of 4095 papers and 9233 links. It is shown in Figure 8. 

Here, colors of nodes represent different clusters. However, we are not attempting to discuss 
the cluster analysis in this work as our major focus is evolutionary trajectory analysis using 
concepts.  

As mentioned in methodology, the different paths obtained are SPC FW, SPC BW, SPC KR, 
SPC  CPM,  FV  FW,  FV  BW,  FV  KR,  FV  CPM  where  FW  indicates  forward  search,  BW 
indicates  backward  search,  KR  indicate  key-route  search,  CPM  indicates  and  critical  path 
method. In this work, as key-route (local) and key-route (global) provided same results, we 
used KR to represent both. Subsequently, Figure 9 shows SPC FW, SPC BW, SPC KR, SPC 
CPM paths while Figure 10 shows FV FW, FV BW, FV KR, FV CPM paths.

As mentioned in the procedure, before going for the creation of concept evolution paths, we 
have to select the paths that are having adequate uniqueness from others to avoid redundancy 
in analysis. For that uniqueness, indices with respect to every pair of paths is created and thus 
we get U-index matrix (Table 7), which is shown below:

The values indicate that apart for the pairs SPC BW- SPC KR and SPC KR- SPC CPM, all 
other values are satisfactorily high enough to indicate distinction. As U value of SPC-KR and 
SPC-BW is close to 0.5, on inspection it is found that most of the works in SPC-BW is found 
in SPC-KR and as SPC-KR has more works, so we can drop SPC BW from our analysis as 
analysis  of  SPC  KR  might  include  most  of  the  evolutionary  information  of  SPC  BW  too. 
Similar is the case of SPC KR and SPC CPM. Thus, inclusion of SPC KR in analysis might 
cover the evolutionary information of both SPC BW and SPC CPM. Now we can proceed for 
the creation of concept evolution paths and its analysis. 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2 Concept evolution path with respect to SPC FW 

From Figure 11, we can see the evolution of concepts. In this concept evolution path, ‘cloud 
computing’ occupies a special place. Firstly, a knowledge convergence from some other fields 
such  as  management  and  electrical  systems  that  might  be  treated  as  application  areas  of 
computer systems towards cloud computing is visible. Among the application fields, power 
grid system is a networked system. When it comes to computing, knowledge flow is witnessed 
from grid computing (in its earlier years) to cloud computing is also found as a part of the initial 
convergence.  Then,  Knowledge  flow  from  cloud  computing  to  advanced  cloud  computing 
systems  and  to  grid  computing  systems  and  then  a  recombination  with  grid  computing  is 
visible.  The  cycle  that  starts  from  cloud  computing  indicates  that  knowledge  advancement 
propagated from cloud computing led to the enhancement of cloud computing itself. After that 
knowledge flow extends towards application areas that again  deal  with  ‘network paradigm’ 
such as scheduling in ‘power grids’, heterogenous distributed systems and big data platform. 

Fig. 11: Concept evolution path with respect to SPC FW 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3 Concept evolution path with respect to SPC KR 

In  fig.  12,  though  no  concepts  are  exactly  phrased  as  ‘cloud  computing’  in  the  concept 
evolution  path  associated  with  SPC  KR  path,  most  of  the  concepts  are  related  to  cloud 
computing. Knowledge flow between cloud technologies and some application areas such as 
management, power grid and other networking aspects are profound in this concept evolution 
path. Knowledge exchange between advanced cloud computing systems and grid computing 
systems is found in this path also just like concept evolution path  with respect to SPC FW. 
Network management applications related to scheduling and resource allocation is also found 
in this path. Towards the end of this path, some important divergences to IoT services, network 
security and management, virtual machines and business processes are observed. These are the 
application areas in which major FGCS technologies especially the ones related to ‘networking 
paradigm’ can make a huge impact. 

Fig. 12: Concept evolution path with respect to SPC KR 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4 Concept evolution path with respect to FV FW  

Advancement  of  cloud  computing  systems  with  the  help  of  knowledge  flow  between  grid 
computing and cloud computing is witnessed in the case of FV FW path too. This evolution is 
characterized by the developments in grid management, architectural changes for data access 
and  management.  These  developments  led  to  ‘mobile  cloud  computing’,  which  is  a 
combination  of  mobile  computing  and  cloud  computing  for  bringing  rich  computational 
resources to mobile users, network operators, as well as cloud computing providers. This is a 
perfect example of technological cross over, which is disseminated by the FGCS journal. The 
evolution  is  recently  heading  towards  Open  Grid  Service  Architecture  Data  Access  and 
Integration (OGSA-DAI) technology that aims to providing interfaces to heterogeneous data 
sources  on  Grids  for  integration  them.  Profound  evolution  of  computing  systems  towards 
‘network paradigm’ is evident from this path too and the well-deserved emphasis on security 
is also observable from the presence of the concept ‘new encryption mechanism’. 

Fig. 13: Concept evolution path with respect to FV FW 

 
 
4.5 Concept evolution path with respect to FV BW  

This path is mainly related to the evolution of IoT systems. At first a knowledge flow from 
management to IoT, especially in terms of network techniques-based resource allocation and 
management is witnessed. Knowledge exchange between IoT and Cloud computing is visible 
in this concept evolution path. As seen in Figure 14, a self-loop in the term ‘Internet of Things’ 
is due to the citation of a paper with ‘Internet of Things’ as top relevant concept by another 
paper with the same phrase as top relevant concept. As IoT systems get more enhanced with 
advanced  cloud  computing  technologies,  some  interesting  divergences  that  are  useful  for 
‘networked  systems’  is  visible.  These  are  network  security  (indicated  by  the  concept  ‘new 
encryption  mechanism’),  blockchain  technology,  etc.  This  evolution  path  highlights  the 
importance of IoT technologies (aided with advanced computing technologies) to revolutionize 
many application areas including business management and banking. 

Fig. 14: Concept evolution path with respect to FV BW 

 
 
 
4.6 Concept evolution path with respect to FV KR  

The evolution  path  shown in  Figure 15 is  also  related to  IoT. Knowledge flow from  cloud 
computing is indicated by the presence of concept ‘integration of cloud’. Knowledge exchange 
from ‘data mining’ and resource management and its role in evolution of IoT is clear from this 
evolution path. Importance of networking aspect in IoT is so profound that major developments 
in it have an impact in distributed computing itself. Recent evolution in computing is found to 
be related to ‘Edge computing’ technology, a network-based distributed computing technology. 
This is another evidence on how well the journal of FGCS is capturing important developments 
in the themes that comes under its scope. 

Fig. 15: Concept evolution path with respect to FV KR 

 
 
 
 
 
4.7 Concept evolution path with respect to FV CPM  

The path shown in Figure 16 gives more information about the knowledge flow to and from 
‘cloud computing’ to various applications and technologies. The impact of developments in 
other fields such as virtual machines on cloud computing and vice versa is also observed.  It 
also  shows  the  extension  chain  of  knowledge  to  big  data  and  data  mining  applications.  
Applications of cloud computing and virtual reality paradigm in management applications is 
also evident from this somewhat more comprehensive concept evolution path. Especially, the 
divergence  from  virtual  machines  towards  different  service  level  applications  of  cloud 
computing is very interesting as well as useful for both academic and industrial practitioners. 
Knowledge  extension  from  cloud  computing  to  multi-domain  networks  is  witnessed  and  a 
divergence  towards  ‘service  function  chains’,  ‘distributed  machine  learning’  and  ‘edge 
computing  systems’  is  visible.  So,  this  concept  evolution  path  captured  the  important 
developments  in  ‘network  paradigm’,  ‘virtual  reality’  and  major  futuristic  computing 
technologies in revolutionizing the current state-of-the-art in their respective fields and also the 
application areas. 

Fig. 16: Concept evolution path with respect to FV CPM 

 
From all the concept evolution paths, a general observation is that cloud computing and also 
grid computing plays a pivotal role in many evolutionary trajectories, and it is very much vital 
for  FGCS.  Technologies  associated  with  ‘Network  paradigm’,  especially  ‘distributed 
computing’  such  as  edge  computing  is  found  to  be  highly  promising  one  that  could 
revolutionize  future  computer  systems  as  well  as  systems  of  generic  appeal  like  IoT  and 
business management systems. It will be an interesting endeavor to dig deeper into these areas 
specifically to capture the specific developments that can work wonders. 

Conclusion 

The article presented analytical results of publication and citation patterns, authorship structure, 
collaboration patterns, major funding sources, gender distribution, social- media visibility and 
UN SDG connections of papers published in FGCS etc. In addition, it traced the major concept 
evolution trajectories through application of a text-integrated path analysis method. It is found 
that  number  of  publications  in  FGCS  grew  by  a  factor  of  45  from  1984  to  2020,  with 
phenomenal growth observed in the 1988-89, 1991-92 and 2017-18. Citations to the journal 
also grew rapidly and the citations per paper has also improved significantly. The FGCS now 
has an h-index of 142. China, United States and United Kingdom are found to be the major 
contributors  to  FGCS  publications.  A  clear  pattern  of  shift  from  single  authored  to  multi-
authored papers is observed during 1984-2020. Similarly, papers from single institution have 
decreased  while  multi-institutional  and  internationally  collaborated  papers  have  increased 
significantly. The open  access  availability  of papers in  FGCS has  also  increased over time, 
reaching to about 20-30% in the recent time. In terms of gender distribution, the proportion of 
female first  authored papers have also  increased to  reach to  about  20% as in  2020. A good 
number  of  FGCS  publications  are  found  to  be  directly  connected  with  Sustainable 
Development Goals. Cloud, Grid, Big Data, IoT, Security, Distributed Systems are found to be 
the major conceptual themes discussed in FGCS publications. Knowledge flows from ‘cloud’ 
to  ‘grid’  and  ‘big  data’  are  visible  among  the  concept  evolution  trajectories.  Similarly, 
knowledge extension from ‘cloud computing’ to ‘multi-domain networks’ is witnessed and a 
divergence  towards  ‘service  function  chains’,  ‘distributed  machine  learning’  and  ‘edge 
computing systems’ is visible. Overall, cloud computing is found to play a pivotal role in many 
concept evolution trajectories. The article thus presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis 
and text-integrated path analysis of concept evolution trajectories of FGCS, which uncovers 
the publication patterns and conceptual structure of FGCS.
