Abstract—Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a decentralized proof
of ownership represent one of the main reasons why Ethereum is
a disruptive technology. This paper presents the ﬁrst systematic
study of the interactions occurring in a number of NFT ecosys-
tems. We illustrate how to retrieve transaction data available
on the blockchain and structure it as a graph-based model.
Thanks to this methodology, we are able to study for the ﬁrst
time the topological structure of NFT networks and show that
their properties (degree distribution and others) are similar to
those of interaction graphs in social networks. Time-dependent
analysis metrics, useful to characterize market inﬂuencers and
interactions between different wallets, are also introduced. Based
on those, we identify across a number of NFT networks the
widespread presence of both investors accumulating NFTs and
individuals who make large proﬁts.

I. INTRODUCTION

People often surround themselves with objects reminding
them of important moments in their lives and experiences.
As a result of the digital revolution, what is considered a
memory has changed dramatically over the last two decades.
For example, photographs that were once printed and stored
in albums or other physical media are now always available
on electronic devices, thanks to the advent of cloud services
and smartphones continuously connected to the Internet. The
extensive use of distributed storage raises numerous questions
about the ownership and conditions of use of digital objects.
The major problems arise because currently, according to
the rules governing intellectual property licensing and online
contracts originally designed for the Internet of the 2000s,
buyers of digital goods are simply users, not owners [1].

The disruptive element introduced by non-fungible tokens
(NFTs) is that NFTs are personal property, not contracts or
pure intellectual property licenses [1], [2]. NFTs allow to
demonstrate the ownership of a digital token in a decentralized
way (i.e., with no need for a central institution issuing and
recognizing a certiﬁcate) so that the token can be used in
various social spaces, today still typically linked to the digital
context. Digital art was one of the ﬁrst applications of NFTs

technology. The likely reason is because of the ease and ability
to showcase the item owned, and the possibility to proﬁt from
the increased value of a unique piece upon resale. This fact
has led an increasing number of artists, including famous ones,
to become interested in this new concept. However, the real
media limelight of NFTs has come through the use of this
technology in collectibles: as of this writing, in July 2021,
the overall market capitalization of the top 100 major NFTs
collections is around $14,492,390,000 [3]. In 2017 CryptoP-
unk and Crypto-Kitties made history in NFT technology – the
former because some of them were sold for the equivalent of
millions of dollars, the latter for making the Ethereum network
unusable for a few days due to the high number of transactions
originated by their exchange. Later NFT collections from
2021 are, for example, the HashMasks, Meebits, and Bored
Ape Yacht Clubs [4]. They are all composed of a limited
set of assets characterised by different levels of rarity. Each
collection is supported by a cohesive and generally large
community communicating on social media platforms such
as Twitter or Discord. Another possible use case for NFTs is
property. This concept is not yet fully implemented in the real
world but very successful in the metaverse, where video game
users can buy and trade parts of collectible virtual universes.
Even if NFTs might become in the next years a powerful
example of digital personal property recognized through a
decentralized entity,
in its infancy.
Newcomers may get lost in its frenetic evolution due to the
lack of systematic summaries and the abundance of hype
cycles. This sometimes obscures the properties of a very
interesting ecosystem whereby items can be exchanged for
very high prices, sometimes hundreds or thousands of ETH.
In addition, natural parallels can be drawn between NFT
transaction networks and graphs describing the interactions
between social media users. The study of the latter has led
to algorithms capable of ﬁnding authoritative sources on the
web or determining user preferences; similarly, exploring the
former might lead to analysis methods able to identify trusted
or inﬂuential users (wallets) and anticipate market evolution.
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst
to propose a systematic analysis of the dynamics governing
the evolution of NFT-related communities in terms of their
interaction graphs and associated properties. The main novel-
ties and ﬁndings that this paper presents are: (1) A systematic
methodology for the analysis of NFT communities; (2) The

the technology is still

 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis of such communities over time; (3) The identiﬁcation
of hub nodes (i.e., wallets) and super-nodes (i.e., wallets across
different NFT collections) that inﬂuence the market.

The paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the
state of the art
in the analysis of graphs related to web
networks, social networks and Ethereum ERC20 (fungible)
tokens. Section III summarizes what an Ethereum ERC-721
smart contract is. Section IV describes which NFT collections
have been analysed for this work and how the data has been
collated; crucially, it deﬁnes the structure of an NFT transac-
tion graph. Section V illustrates the topological and clustering
analysis of such transaction graphs. Section VI presents the
methodologies for estimating the value of a collection and
how to identify from the ﬂows between major wallets and
most successful investors. Finally, section VII concludes the
paper and provides some ideas for possible further analysis.

II. RELATED WORK

Some of the metrics most commonly used to identify trends
in the cryptocurrency market include technical analysis (i.e.,
studying price charts to identify opportunities), fundamental
analysis (i.e., studying the economic and technological factors
underlying a project), and metrics extracted from social media.
The latter can help an investor take the pulse of what the
general public is focusing on; analyzing the mentions a project
gets on Twitter or examining Google Trends data are other
examples of alternative ways traders monitor emerging trends
and industry cycles in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Analysis of web searches and how more relevance is given
to one web page than another is a ﬁeld with a ﬂourishing
literature. In general, each web page is modelled as a node
and the connections between them as graph links [5]. Analyses
of this kind are for instance at the heart of search engines
(e.g., Google, Baidu, Microsoft Bing). They are also used to
understand how to produce increasingly effective web content
and advertising campaigns, and to identify trends that are
emerging among users [6], [7].

i.e.

Similarly, data analysis of social networks generally in-
volves modelling the network(s) as a directed graph where
the nodes are the users and the connections are the iterations
between them. Seminal work on this type of analysis dates
back to 2007,
just after the foundation of Facebook
(2004) and Twitter (2006), with the work presented in [8].
In this work, which was the ﬁrst to propose a methodology to
examine multiple online social networks at scale and related
examples, roughly 11.3 million users and 328 million links
were analyzed. By measuring the topological properties of
these graphs, the groundwork was established to deﬁne key
concepts, for instance that inﬂuential and hub nodes can drive
the sentiment of a large number of network nodes [9]–[11].

Similar analysis techniques have been applied to blockchain
transactions. Speciﬁcally, much of the research has focused
on analyzing transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain to deﬁne
ﬂows and de-anonymize wallets. However, graph analysis
seems much better suited to account-based blockchains like
Ethereum rather than UTXO-based like Bitcoin [8], [12]–[14].

With respect to Ethereum, some current research has focused
on the analysis of ERC20 [15] (fungible) token transactions.
In [12] it has been shown how the entire (global) network
of ERC20 token transfers follows a power-law in its degree
distribution, but this cannot be stated for many individual token
networks. This is because many of the ERC20 token networks
follow either a star or a hub-and-spoke pattern. The heavy
tails in the degree distribution are not as pronounced as in
social networks: ERC20 token networks tend to contain less
and smaller hubs. Furthermore, the main use case of many
such tokens appears to be for trading and the number of
exchanges is limited, meaning that only a few agents succeed
in gaining the trust of the users. This leads to big hubs that
can potentially obscure the real impact on market dynamics
had by other smaller but more inﬂuential nodes.

III. ERC-721 NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN STANDARD

A NFT is used to uniquely identify something or someone.
For instance,
typical use cases are related to collectibles,
access keys, tickets, numbered seats for concerts and sport
events. ERC-721 (Ethereum Request for Comments 721,
see [16]) standardizes non-fungible tokens by deﬁning an
API interface to implement a smart contract on the Ethereum
blockchain and by mandating the functionality that such a
smart contract must provide. The functionality is mainly
related to the transfer of tokens from one account to another,
the retrieval of the current balance of a wallet, and the retrieval
of the ownership of a speciﬁc token. As an example of a
ERC-721 smart contract, the interested reader can refer to the
deployed source code of the HashMasks smart contract [17].

IV. COLLECTING AND REPRESENTING DATA

All

the analyses described below were performed on a
desktop computer equipped with a quad-core Intel i7 Kaby
Lake CPU and 16 GB of RAM, running MacOS Big Sur 11.4.
Each NFT transaction dataset ranged from 10 to 20 MB in size.

A. Selected NFT projects

In this work, 8 different NFT projects have been analyzed.
These are reported in Table I along with the Ethereum address
of their smart contracts. The choice of these 8 different projects
is motivated by the fact that these are, to the best of the
authors’ knowledge, the most signiﬁcant ones in terms of
both market capitalisation and popularity, across categories
such as proﬁle pictures, curated digital art and metaverse.

Table II reports the projects summary in terms of unique
assets (i.e., available tokens), net worth, number of different
owners (i.e., wallets), traded volume and ﬂoor price reported
the 15th July 2021. The net worth value has been retrieved
from [18], the CryptoPunks ﬂoor price from [19], while the
other values come from [4]. Furthermore, as with the rest
of the article, the value of 1 ETH has been normalized to
2000$ from the daily price retrieved from [20] so as to make
values comparable. Unfortunately, as illustrated by the table,
some values are unavailable even after aggregating data from
different websites. Despite the fact that market capitalization is
growing rapidly, the main reason why this crucial information
is missing is a generalized lack of services offering complete
and detailed analytics for all the existing NFT projects.

B. Data extraction

Blockchains store massive amounts of heterogeneous data
that grows over time. Focusing on the Ethereum network,
when searching for information on the blockchain it is neces-
sary to directly access records (blocks) using a unique identi-
ﬁer (e.g. block ID, transaction, wallet or contract address) [21].
As a result, effective techniques for data storage and extraction
must be adopted [22] in order to conduct analysis effectively
without having to sequentially walk through all the blockchain
data. The last few years have seen the creation of services,
some of them free and other ones commercial, capable of stor-
ing blockchain information daily and incrementally, in speciﬁc
infrastructures suited to the analysis of Big Data. These can
then be subsequently queried using traditional SQL syntax
(see [23], [24]). For the purpose of this work, the Google
BigQuery platform [25] has been used. Blockchain data was
extracted in an organized way that would facilitate subsequent
analysis. The results were stored in comma separated value

(CSV) ﬁles, accessible to the interested reader from [26]. The
ﬁelds include information such as the hash of the transaction,
the address of the NFT smart contract, the addresses of the
wallet(s) or smart contract(s) that sold and purchased the NFT
token, the Ethereum block time as milliseconds from the UNIX
epoch, the Ethereum block number, the value of ETH and/or
WETH (Wrapped ETH) transferred and the number of tokens
exchanged during the transaction (can be more than one). It
should be noted that a few transactions involve ETH/WETH
transfers to more than one address or transfers back to the
originating address, resulting in more than one record having
the same transaction hash. The simpliﬁcations made for the
queries were: when the seller goes through a proxy contract
(e.g., see [27]) the maximum amount of ETH and/or WETH
traded is considered as a cost; gas fees (i.e., transaction costs)
are excluded from the analysis; if the exchange currency is
neither ETH nor WETH the transaction is seen as a simple
transfer (seen that the vast majority of the transactions happen
in ETH or WETH, we evaluated that this assumption still
produces reasonable estimates of the exchange volumes while
signiﬁcantly reducing the complexity of the queries used).
Whenever more than one token is exchanged in the same
transaction, the individual price of each token is considered
the same, and computed by splitting the total amount of the
transaction into equal parts. For each NFT collection, data was
harvested from the date of their creation to July 15th, 2021.

C. Bulk statistics

As a ﬁrst analysis, we deﬁned and summarized two types of
account addresses and three different types of transactions. As
per general Ethereum terminology [28], there are two different
types of accounts:

• EoAs: externally owned accounts, controlled by private

keys (i.e., a general purpose personal wallet);

• CAs: contract accounts, controlled by their contract code.

We also categorized transactions into three different types:

• Buy/Sell: Indicates a transaction where the selling address
is different from the buying address and where the buying
address has exchanged the token for a non-zero amount
of ETH and/or WETH;

• Transfer: The selling address is the same as the buying
address, and/or the transaction has been made with a non-
zero amount of ETH and WETH;

• Mint: The selling address is 0x000000. Minting transac-
tions are special ones that are generally used to create an
initial distribution of tokens. This is done, for example,
by invoking a minting function in the smart contract until
all assets are distributed (see for instance the mintNFT()
function in the HashMasks contract [29]).

Statistics for the ﬁrst category are summarized in Table III.
For self-transactions (see e.g. [30]) the exchanged ETH and/or
WETH value does not contribute to the traded volume.

D. Transactions graph model

The collected transactions can be structured in a multi-
directed weighted graph M DG(V, E) with a set of nodes V
and edges E = {(vi, vj)k | vi ∈ V, vj ∈ V, k ∈ N+}. Each
node vi ∈ V represents a unique wallet, and each directed
edge ek
i,j ∈ E represents a single token transaction from vi
to vj. For each transaction, additional information is deﬁned
and stored as an edge parameter. Examples are the weight
w(vi, vj)k corresponding to the cost payed by the wallet vj to
the wallet vi to perform the transaction (i.e., to buy the token);
the ID of the transferred token, T (vi, vj)k; and the transaction
time τ (vi, vj)k.

V. TRANSACTION GRAPH ANALYSIS

In this section we present the main static properties of
the NFT transaction graphs derived from the data collected
in Section IV. In particular, properties such as distributions
of degree, density, component clustering coefﬁcients, and
assortativity, are all evaluated and discussed.

The power-law results described in Section V-B have been

obtained using the poweRlaw package in R [31].

A. Basic quantities

Only transactions between two EoA addresses have been
considered in this work. We did so because the main objective
of this work is to discover and analyze the behavior of
communities participating in the buying and selling of NFTs.
Thus, we attempted to eliminate at least some of the biases
by discarding all the transactions made by smart contracts
and not by generic wallets (the latter likely corresponding
to actual users). In addition, we eliminated the mint node:
every transaction between the mint node and a generic node
of the graph was saved as a parameter of the node itself. This
additional parameter, discussed in the next sections, allows to
calculate the distribution of node in-degrees and the ﬂows of
tokens within the network without disrupting connectivity and
clustering analysis.

Table IV summarizes measurements for each transaction
graph (in terms of number of nodes and edges, diameter
and mean distance) when each NFT project is considered
separately. It also shows the same quantities for the graph

larger a node, the more tokens it has accumulated from a given
collection). In Figure 1d the edges are coloured according to
the project the transferred token belongs to; one can see that
real, separated wallet communities do exist according to each
project, but also that wallets trading on more than one project
are frequent. Interestingly, the diameter (i.e. the length of the
longest path, measured as the number of edges) and the mean
distance (i.e. the average number of edges between any two
nodes in the network) are very similar to those identiﬁed in [8]
from the analysis of social network graphs (see Table VII).
That is true for individual and combined transaction graphs.

B. General topological properties

Fundamental properties of a directed graph are in- and
out-degree of nodes. The frequency distribution of degrees
in transaction graphs can provide insight into user behavior
when trading a particular collection of NFTs. Many real-
world graphs for social media and the Internet show highly
skewed, heavy-tailed degree distributions [5], [8], [12], [32].
This generally indicates that a signiﬁcant portion of the
information about node interactions needs to be extrapolated
from the analysis of their tails, and in general demonstrates
the existence of (several) high degree hubs. For example, in
Ethereum ERC20 token networks hubs are exchanges [12], in
social networks they are inﬂuencer nodes [8], [33], and in web
networks they are popular and high-ranked websites [32]. Sev-
eral kinds of networks have been conﬁrmed to follow power
laws in their degree distribution [5], [8], [12], [32]. Power
laws are distributions of the form p(x) = Cx−α, in which the
dependent variable, the probability for a node to have degree

k, varies as an inverse power of the independent variable,
the degree x. In other words, p(x) decreases monotonically,
but signiﬁcantly slower than the exponential decay of normal
distributions. While the non-negative constant C is ﬁxed by
normalization, the parameter α is called the coefﬁcient of the
power law. Typical values of α are is in the range 2 ≤ α ≤ 3.
Figure 2 shows the complementary cumulative distribution
function (CCDF) of in- and out-degree, and the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the in-degree to out-degree ratio
for each measured NFT network.

Fig. 2. Degree analysis for the different NFT collection graph: complementary
in- and out-degree probability distribution, and cumulative distribution of
the in- to out-degree ratio. Power-law parameters obtained from the degree
probability distribution are reported in Table V.

Table V shows the estimated power-law coefﬁcient for each
NFT network along with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-
of-ﬁt metric [34]. The best-ﬁt power-law coefﬁcients approx-
imate the distributions very well for all NFT collections
when they are considered separately except for the case of
Decentraland. Table V shows the values for graphs built for
web network [5], social network [8], and the global ERC20

As for social networks, the
values reported in the table represent the mathematical average
of the values reported for Flickr, Livejournal, and YouTube
(data for Orkut has been excluded because incomplete, as
also stated in [8]). It is worth mentioning that despite many
network graphs following a power-law distribution, the ones
for a number of ERC20 (fungible) tokens do not do so when
considered individually. In fact, in [12] it has been shown
that
individual networks for ERC20 (fungible) tokens are
frequently dominated by a single hub (generally an exchange)
and follow either a star or a hub-and-spoke pattern where the
heavy tails in the degree distribution are not as pronounced
as in social networks. However, this is not the behaviour that
we observe for ERC721 (non-fungible) tokens. Interestingly,
Figure 2 panels A and B shows that all
the power-law
coefﬁcients for the separate networks are similar, but the one
for the combined network is different. This is probably due to
the different proportion of hubs in the separate and combined
network.

Another interesting parameter to analyze is the relationship
between in- and out-degree of each node. In other words,
this indicates what is the ratio between purchases (i.e., ac-
cumulation) and sales for the various wallets that make up the
network. As an example, studies on the distribution of in- and
out-degree in web networks have consistently helped with the
identiﬁcation of better methods to ﬁnd relevant information on
the web. Generally speaking, in web networks the population
of pages that are active (i.e., that have a high out-degree)
is not the same as the population of pages that are popular
(i.e., that have a high in-degree). As pointed out in [32], web-
search techniques can be very effective when they are able
to separate a very small set of popular pages from a much
larger set of active pages. As shown in Figure 2 panel 3,
NFT transaction networks have a large number of active nodes
with low in- to out-degree ratio, (i.e., nodes selling NFTs),
and a much more limited number of nodes with high ratio
(i.e., nodes accumulating NFTs). We can then draw a natural
parallel between web inﬂuencers and accumulators of NFTs.

C. Connectivity and clustering properties

The assortativity coefﬁcient [35] measures the level of
homophyly of the graph (i.e., how nodes are connected with
respect to a given property) and its value range is [−1, 1].
According to [35], the graph is said to be strongly assor-
tative, weakly assortative, neutral, weakly disassortative, and
strongly disassortative, if the assortativity coefﬁcient falls into
the ranges [0.6, 1], [0.2, 0.6), (−0.2, 0.2), (−0.6, −0.2], and
[−1, −0.6], respectively. Table VI illustrates the assortativities
for NFT transaction graphs. It shows that most of them
are neutral associative, with the exception of Acclimated
Moon Cats that are strongly assortative, and ArtBlocks and
CryptoPunks that are weakly assortative. The transitivity co-
efﬁcient (also known as clustering coefﬁcient) measures the
probability for adjacent nodes of a network to be connected
if there is a link e(vi, vj) or e(vj, vi)
– in other words,
and a link e(vj, vk) or e(vk, vj), what is the probability of

there being a link e(vi, vk) or e(vk, vi). Table VI illustrates
the various levels of transitivity of the graphs: they all tend
towards 0, indicating that collaboration between wallets is
very rare. The reciprocity coefﬁcient measures the proportion
of mutual connections on a direct graph. In other words, it
estimates the probability that given an edge e(vi, vj), then its
reciprocal e(vj, vi) also exists. From Table VI it is possible
to see that reciprocity levels are close to zero, indicating
in fact that buy/sell trades are only made in one direction,
which is also the case when considering the global graph. In
other words, exchanges between wallets are still uncommon.
Figure 3 shows the CCDF of both pagerank and coreness
values for the NFT transaction network graphs considered.
First, the distribution of pageranks [36] in each graph was
analyzed. This metric is generally used in web network graphs
to estimate the importance of each node. The results show
the presence of nodes that are more important than others.
On the other hand, coreness is a measure used to identify
closely interconnected groups within a network. A k-core is
a (maximal) group of entities, all connected to at least k
other entities in the same group. As can be seen from the
ﬁgure, these networks have cores of degrees greater than 100,
albeit with very low probability. It must be noted that, as
demonstrated in [37], high coreness nodes are not always
inﬂuencers, although it is highly likely that inﬂuencer nodes
are high coreness nodes.

distributions. The colours are the same as those of the legend in Figure 2.

VI. TIME BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS

This section discusses some results obtained by analysing
NFT transaction graphs and taking into account the timestamps
at which transactions are made. In particular, a methodology is
deﬁned to: estimate how both the value of an entire collection
and of a single wallet vary with time; calculate the daily
volume exchanged to identify the major owners of tokens in
a collection; follow token accumulation and sale ﬂows.

A. Collection and wallets value

As with other types of assets such as cryptocurrencies or
stocks, one of the most relevant quantities when analyzing an
NFT project is how its value evolves over time. In the case of
ERC721 tokens, the valuation can be done on several levels:
(1) analyzing price evolution for each single token; (2) ana-
lyzing the evolution of the value of the whole collection. The
latter can be calculated as the sum of all the last transaction

price of the tokens in a collection. Self-transactions and zero-
cost transactions (previously also referred to as transfers) are
excluded from the calculation. Figure 4a illustrates the value
trend for selected projects from Table I (HashMasks, Bored
Apes, Meebits, MoonCats, and ArtBlocks). This analysis can
then be applied to the individual wallets that have at least one
token of a given collection: results are illustrated in Figure 4b.
They show the widespread presence across a number of NFT
networks of both investors accumulating NFTs and individuals
who make large proﬁts. Another important metric for a project
is the time evolution of the number of unique wallets holding
at least one token from the collection – for the NFT projects
under consideration, this is shown in Figure 4c. As for typical
successful projects, both this number and the overall value of
the network grow with time.

B. Exchanged volume and number of transactions

In order to understand how interesting a collection is,
especially during hype cycles, one of the fundamental values
that must be observed (in addition to the number of unique
owners) is the number of daily transactions together with the
daily volume traded. These values are calculated by summing
up the costs of transactions that have been executed on the
same day. For the collections examined, these two trends are
shown in Figure 4e and Figure 4f, respectively. By analysing
the links in the graph, it is also possible to estimate two
other parameters that indicate the evolution of the value of a
collection: the average price multiplier for a token with respect

to the cost of minting or exchanging it for the ﬁrst time,
and the average number of transactions (including minting)
for each token in the collection. The results are shown in
the earlier a
Figure 4g and Figure 4h. As can be seen,
purchase is made (i.e., during the mint or just after), the greater
the probability of making a proﬁt by reselling a token. The
results of the second analysis are summarized in Figure 4i:
in general, a large proportion of the tokens in each collection
were bought at minting time and have not been sold since.
This is certainly an indicator of how much NFT technology
is in its infancy. An alternative explanation is that NFTs
are seen as a store-of-value investment, both to be resold
only at some future time. Interestingly though, looking at the
example of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which have the
highest exchange probability, they are also characterized by
a substantial increase in the value of the collection in a very
short time frame (see Figure 4a).

C. Flows of major owners

One of the big differences between ERC-20 (fungible) and
ERC-721 (non-fungible) tokens is that the latter are an asset
generally made for display, as many of these collections have
very high entry prices (see e.g. the Cryptopunks ﬂoor price
from Table III). This is why even different NFTs are typically
to be displayed in
accumulated in the same wallet (e.g.,
online galleries and associated to a social media proﬁle). It
is therefore possible to identify for a given collection which
wallets have had the largest amount of tokens over time since

Figures 4j, 4k and 4l illustrate the evolution of the 5 top wallets
for the collections of HashMasks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and
Meebits respectively. HashmMask and Meebits have a very
similar trend, where the ﬁrst 3 wallets have consolidated their
position during the time; on the other hand, for the Bored Ape
Yacht Club the top wallet [38] has, after an initial dormant
phase, put all its tokens on the market, making the value of
the whole collection increase as a consequence (Figure 4a).
This wallet is one of a number of successful investors who
did succeed at extracting large proﬁts from NFT collections.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, the ﬁrst systematic analysis of transactions in
an NFT ecosystem based on the Ethereum blockchain has been
presented. Some of today’s best known NFT projects (such as
CryptoPunks, HashMasks and ArtBlocks) have been analysed.
By ﬁltering information publicly available on the blockchain,
and structuring it in a graph model, one can perform systematic
analysis and deﬁne metrics that help establishing how the
wallets participating in this ecosystem interact. It was shown
that these graphs follow a power-law in their nodes degree
distribution. Topological values such as graph diameter and
mean distance were then compared with state of art results
for graphs derived for web networks, social networks and
ERC20 token network. That led to the conclusion that the
structure of NFT networks is qualitatively very similar to the
one measured for interactions in social networks. Furthermore,
a methodology was provided to identify the major NFT owners
and follow their buying and selling ﬂows. In fact, this study
can help shed quantitative light on a market which might
otherwise be prone to hype and misleading information.

Further research may reﬁne our understanding of wallets
holding many NFTs. In this work we were able to identify
them, but further investigation is needed to identify how their
strategies (in terms of accumulation and subsequent selling)
on one or more collections affect the markets and the overall
value of the different NFTs. In addition, the analysis might
be reﬁned by considering the total costs of each transaction
(e.g., split payments when the transaction goes through a smart
contract, and Ethereum gas fees). However, doing so will not
change the main conclusions of this study.
