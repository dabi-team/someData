Abstract— Travel has been challenging recently
since different nations have implemented varied
immigration and travel policies. For the time
being, immigration officials want proof of each
person's immunity to the virus. A vaccine
passport serves as evidence that a person has
tested negative for or is immune to a particular
virus. In terms of COVID-19, those who hold a
vaccine passport will be permitted entry into
other nations as long as they can provide proof
that they have COVID-19 antibodies from prior
COVID-19
infections
immunizations. To reduce time and effort spent
managing data, the vaccination passport system
has been digitalized. The process of contact
tracing may be facilitated by digitization. The
"Blockchain technology" system, which is
currently in use, has demonstrated its security
and privacy in systems
for data exchange
among bitcoin users. The Digital Vaccination
Passport scheme can use Blockchain technology.
The end result would be a decentralized,
traceable,
auditable,
secure, and trustworthy solution based on the

authorization. The COVID-19 vaccines are widely
credited with helping to stop the disease's spread as
well as its severity and fatality rates. Many nations
adopted staggered distribution strategies that gave
priority to individuals who were most vulnerable to
problems, such the elderly, and to exposure and
transmission risks,
like healthcare personnel.
According to official statistics from national public
health organisations, 11.81 billion doses of the
COVID-19 vaccination have been given worldwide
as of May 26, 2022. By December 2020, more than
10 billion vaccine doses had been pre-ordered by
nations, with 14 percent of the world's population,
or roughly half of the doses, coming from high-
income nations.

Many governments are thinking about developing
contemporary, digital vaccine passports that are
more difficult
to fake, even though vaccination
cards like yellow cards are still in use and are still a
common means to track immunizations. Multiple
nations are investigating whether vaccine passports
and health permits could be used as proof of
COVID-19 vaccination in light of the public health
hazard posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This
would let individuals resume their regular activities
and restore confidence in international travel. With

IMPLEMENTATION

We have implemented the proposed framework
using the following technologies:

1.

ETHEREUM

created Ethereum in
known
often

A decentralised, open-source blockchain with smart
contract capabilities is called Ethereum. The site
uses Ether (ETH) as its native coin. Programmer
2013.
Vitalik Buterin
Ethereum 2.0,
is
currently[may be out of date as of March 2022]
under open-source development. The primary goal
of the update is to boost the network's transaction
throughput from its present pace of roughly 15
transactions per second[citation needed] to perhaps
as much as tens of thousands of transactions per
second.

as Eth2,

Ethereum is a permissionless, non-hierarchical
network of computers (nodes) that constructs and
reaches consensus on the blockchain, a continually
expanding collection of "blocks" or groups of
transactions. Each block has a unique identifier for
the chain that must come before it in order for it to
be regarded as genuine. The ETH balances and
other storage values of Ethereum accounts are
changed whenever a node adds a block to its chain

2

by carrying out the transactions in the block in the
order they are specified. The "state," or collection
of these balances and values, is kept on the node
independently of the blockchain in a Merkle tree.

2.

SOLIDITY

Smart contracts can be implemented using Solidity,
a high-level programming language that is contract-
oriented. C++, Python, and JavaScript have heavily
inspired the development of Solidity, which was
made with the Ethereum Virtual Machine in mind
(EVM).

The runtime environment for smart contracts in
Ethereum is the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or
EVM. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is focused on
ensuring security and enabling machines all across
the world to run untrusted code.

The EVM is specialised in thwarting denial-of-
service attacks and guarantees that applications
cannot access each other's state, allowing for
uninterrupted
communication. The Ethereum
Virtual Machine was created to operate as a
for Ethereum-based smart
runtime environment
contracts.

3. FIREBASE

User authentication is one of the most crucial
criteria for Android apps in the modern era. User
authentication is crucial, but if we have to create all
of this code by hand, it will be much more difficult.

With Firebase's assistance,
this is accomplished
relatively quickly. The FirebaseUI allows us to sign
people into our app. It manages the UI processes
for logging in using an email address and password,
phone numbers, and widely used providers, such as
Google Sign-In and Facebook Login. Also possible
are situations like account recovery. UI design is
not necessary because one is already available to us.
It implies that the activities need not be recorded.

Before we can login someone into our app, we need
their authentication credentials. The
to collect
user's email address and password can serve as
their credentials. An OAuth token from an identity
provider can be used as the credential. We then
provide the Firebase Authentication SDK with
these credentials. After confirming such credentials,
backend services will reply to the client.

4. FRONT END FRAMEWORKS
 HTML

Standard markup for documents intended to be
seen in a web browser
is called HTML, or
HyperText Markup Language. Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript are examples of
technologies that can help with this.

 CSS

A style sheet
language called Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) is used to describe how a document
produced in a markup language like HTML or
XML is presented (including XML dialects such as
SVG, MathML or XHTML). The World Wide
Web's
along with
technologies,
HTML and JavaScript, include CSS.

foundational

 JAVASCRIPT

the computer
Along with HTML and CSS,
language known as JavaScript, or JS, is one of the
foundational elements of the World Wide Web. By
2022, 98% of websites will employ JavaScript on
the client side to control how web pages behave,
frequently using third-party libraries. A dedicated
JavaScript engine is available in every major web
browser and is used to run the code on users'
devices.

III.METHODOLOGY

There are four important phases in the operation of
the proposed framework

1)Registration of healthcare authorities

2)Registration of immigration officer

3)Covid-19 certificate issuing

4)Covid-19 certificate verification

3

1. Registration of healthcare authorities:

In this phase to register himself,
the healthcare
provider provides his Email(registered with the
hospital) and password to the concerned healthcare
authorities. The healthcare authority will register
the healthcare provider using the information
provided, to the network through the UI provided.
Now the healthcare provider can log in to the
blockchain network through the login credentials
provided at the time of registration

2. Registration of immigration officers:

Immigration officers are the registered personnel
who are responsible for the verification of required
documents of the traveller who is travelling from
one place to the other. The immigration officer has
to be registered to the network in order to do the
aforementioned. The trusted authority collects the
credentials provided by the immigration officer in
order to register them to the network.

3. Covid-19 certificate issuing:

The healthcare provider will be updating the
following information onto the blockchain network:

2. Name as in registered ID

3. Vaccination information

The immigration officer verifies the vaccination
information of the traveller during the immigration
process. The immigration officer does so by using
the aadhar card number provided by the traveller.
The immigration officer feeds the aadhar card
number to the UI provided and searches for the
vaccination record associated with the aadhar card
number. Now the immigration officer can cross-
verify the vaccination information of the traveller.

Covid 19 certificates validates whether a particular
individual is vaccinated or not. Travel constraints
arises when covid 19 certificate is not submitted.
These Certificates are made mandatory in the field
like film theatres, hospitals, airports etc. which
makes this a necessary document to carry with. So

this
literature focus on the concept of digital vaccine
passport with the help of blockchain technology to
generate the covid 19 vaccination certificates which
are tamper-proof and cannot be faked. This takes
user privacy in to account as well as security of
documents. Since block chain is used with the use
of smart contracts we can generate new secure
block of data when new information is added.
Proposed system allows the healthcare officials to
register in the website and add the details of persons
who are vaccinated and generate the certificate.
Also, user can access the certificate using his
credentials. This proposed system provides good
security and privacy to user data by using
blockchain technology
