ABSTRACT
In this paper, we represent the problem of selecting miners within
a blockchain-based system as a subset selection problem. We for-
mulate the problem of minimising blockchain energy consumption
as an optimisation problem with two conflicting objectives: energy
consumption and trust. The proposed model is compared across
different algorithms to demonstrate its performance.

1 INTRODUCTION
Blockchain technology is a novel form of replicated database (‘dis-
tributed ledger’) that operates autonomously without a centralised
control. It has several key characteristics, such as auditability,
anonymity, persistence and decentralisation. Although this technol-
ogy holds much promise for the future, it also has some challenges.
A major issue is the energy consumption of the Proof of Work (PoW)
consensus algorithm. PoW consumes a large amount of energy and
will have significant environmental consequences if it is widely
employed. In November 2019, a transaction of the most common

blockchain-based system (Bitcoin [7]) required on average 431 kWh
of electricity which is enough energy to power 21 US homes for 24
hours [12].

Since PoW based blockchain-based systems employ considerable
computing resources (and thus have considerable energy consump-
tion), many researchers and organisations have proposed alterna-
tive consensus algorithms, in an effort to reduce its energy con-
sumption. However, minimising energy consumption has not been
formulated as an optimisation problem. In this work, we formulate
the problem of selecting miners for mining blocks in a blockchain-
based system as a subset selection problem.

The problem is represented as selecting a set of miners within a
blockchain network, where each miner demands a level of energy
and has a level of reputation. Given the conflicting goals of minimis-
ing energy and maximising trust, we use evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) to select miners that consume less energy and have high
reputation values. The fitness function considers energy versus
reputation.

2 OPTIMISATION PROBLEM FORMULATION
Blockchain-based systems are like many other real-world applica-
tions where there are trade-offs. In blockchain-based systems, the
many objectives show the advantages of compromise, which can
be considered one sort of optimisation problem. These objectives
include, among others, energy consumption, trust, decentralisation,
scalability, performance and security. We have summarised some
conflicting blockchain objectives that can be utilised to optimise
blockchain-based systems (See Table 1).

There have been several interesting and successful implemen-
tations of multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithms

(MOEAs) for finding optimum and near-optimum solutions for
different real-world application problems such as optimising the
energy use of software [2, 3]. However, MOEAs have not been used
to optimise for energy use and trust in blockchain-based systems.

2.1 Optimisation Model
In this work, we utilise MOEAs to improve the energy consump-
tion of blockchain-based systems. We formulate the problem of
minimising the energy consumption of a blockchain-based system
by selecting a subset of miners, which decreases the energy use
and maximises the trust level of the system; miners selection seeks
high reputation values.

2.1.1 Energy Consumption Objective. The focus of this work
is on saving energy expended by miners during computing pro-
cedures to boost the sustainability of blockchain-based systems.
The energy consumed during mining procedures accounts for a
large proportion of the energy consumed by blockchain-based sys-
tems. Reducing this energy consumption level is the optimisation
objective: the smaller the energy value, the fitter the solution. We
calculate the total energy of each miner based on the energy con-
sumption of the devices used during 24 hours.

2.1.2 Reputation Objective. Our model, which was inspired by
PoS and PoW, features a reduced number of miners, which means
we need to increase the blockchain-based systems’ trust levels to
aid the PoW consensus algorithm. The trustworthiness of miners
within a blockchain network is evaluated after each published block.
Thereafter, the reputation values are calculated using two features:
each miner’s stake and the number of blocks added by each miner
are collected and used to calculate the reputation values.

3 EVALUATION
To evaluate our proposal, we use a blockchain simulator (Bitcoin-
Simulator [5]) to collect miners’ data (the number of blocks produce
by each miner and the rewards and fees miners earn). The simulator
was set to simulate the behaviour of 160 miners for mining 4073
blocks. To run our experiments, we use the MOEA framework 1.
Since we address the optimisation of the energy consumption for
selecting miners as a new optimisation problem, we integrated our
proposed fitness functions into two EAs (SPEA2 and NSGAII). We
also use the Random Search (RS) algorithm as a baseline for our
comparisons. Each algorithm was run 100 times with an evaluation
budget of 40,000 per run. To approximate the Pareto front, we
combine each algorithm’s non-dominated set of solutions.

Figure 1 shows that SPEA2 and NSGA-II consistently find non-
dominated solutions from the Pareto front. For minimising the
energy use and maximising the reputation, we can clearly see that
the RS is the worst performing among the algorithms.

The results of the statistical test (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum
test [11]) and the effect size (Vargha and Delaney effect size [10]) for
the performance of each algorithm show that the hypervolume of
the Random Search algorithm is significantly lower than the other
algorithm hypervolume. Of all the algorithms, NSGAII performed

the best. The algorithm generated the most diverse, non-dominated
set, which covers most of the search space.

For future work, we plan to conduct further experiments and
investigations such as using different MOEAs and comparing their
performance, conducting sensitivity analysis on the algorithms
configurations. We will integrate our approach with the common
consensus algorithm PoW and their variants to report on the ef-
fectiveness of the integration on its energy efficiency with several
dimensions such as mining and energy source (e.g. renewable).
