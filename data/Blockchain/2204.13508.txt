Abstract—In accordance with the guidelines of the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF), Virtual Asset Service Providers
(VASPs) should comply with a ‘travel rule’, which requires them
to exchange originator’s and beneﬁciary’s personal information
when transferring virtual assets. In this paper, we propose a novel
blockchain-based travel rule compliance system that supports
fully-decentralized data exchange. The proposed system uses a
permissioned blockchain, and thereby eliminates the possibility
of leakage of personal information to third parties or even to
travel rule service providers, and ensures that travel rule data
can be managed securely.

I. INTRODUCTION

The use of virtual assets for illegal purposes has increased,
so, Financial Action Task Force (FATF) proposed guidelines
to prevent money laundering and ﬁnancing of terrorism [1–
3]. The guidelines include travel rule guidance that aims
to have virtual asset service providers (VASP) fulﬁll their
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terror-
ism (AML/CFT) obligations [4]. The travel rule guidance is
provided in Recommendation 16 and is intended to restrict
terrorists and criminals from moving funds freely by virtual
asset transfers [5]. To this end, the travel rule requires VASPs
to share identifying information regarding originator (sender
of virtual assets) and beneﬁciary (receiver of virtual assets).
FATF updated the travel rule guidelines in October 2021 [6]. In
response to FATF’s guidelines, each country is preparing laws
on virtual assets and VASP to comply with FATF regulations.
In this paper, we propose a novel travel rule compliance
system that uses blockchain to comply with the travel rule
[7]. In our proposed system, authentication and data exchange
between VASPs are performed in a peer-to-peer (P2P) way by
using blockchain, so that travel rule data can be exchanged
without third-party intermediaries and unnecessary data expo-
sure. Thus, our system is completely decentralized and secure.

II. RELATED WORK

Various companies around the world are developing travel
rule compliance systems to comply with the guidelines stipu-

lated by FATF (see Table I). These guidelines have no restric-
tions on the development of travel rule compliance systems.
Most systems [8–12] use a central server for authentication
or even data-exchange. This may cause a single point of
failure and a serious leakage of personal
information. To
overcome this, blockchain technology can be applied to travel
rule solutions. With the use of blockchain technology, it is
more efﬁcient than the use of traditional methods to exchange
information, and has advantages in various aspects such as
cost and storage place management.

OpenVASP [13] uses Ethereum and does not require au-
thentication processes by third parties. However, blockchain
is only used during the process of authenticating the identity;
the messaging protocol is used separately from the blockchain
i.e., OpenVASP only
in the actual data-exchange process,
partially uses blockchain.

III. DESIGN

Our blockchain-based travel rule compliance system has
some advantages. First, thanks to the principle of blockchain,
third-party intervention is not required. In some of the existing
solutions, the exchange of travel rule data between the VASPs
is brokered by a third party, such as the solution-provider’s
central server. In this case, the customer’s personal information
held by the exchange may be unnecessarily exposed, and each
exchange bears the risk of exposing such personal informa-
tion. However, by using blockchain, transaction parties can
exchange data in a P2P manner, and thereby prevent unwanted
exposure from irrelevant third parties.

Travel rule data can be directly exchanged between the two
VASPs, and the swapped data can be retained by each to follow
decentralization. However, in this case, if one party arbitrarily
modiﬁes or deletes data, a discrepancy occurs between the data
maintained by the two VASPs. This discrepancy complicates
the task of determining which data are genuine and which
are not. In contrast, in a blockchain, data cannot be modiﬁed
or deleted without the consent of the parties involved in the
transaction. Even if a VASP succeeds in maliciously modifying
the data, the deed cannot be hidden, because all records of
data changes remain transparent on the blockchain. Therefore,
the travel rule solution that uses blockchain enables secure
management of personal information.

The architecture of our travel rule compliance system (see
Fig. 1) takes the form of a permissioned blockchain network
to allow only authenticated VASPs to use the system to ex-
change personal information with counterpart VASPs. A VASP
authentication node veriﬁes the identity of the VASP that
wants to participate in the network and grants the authority.
Authenticated VASPs must operate a single individual node,
and must store the data generated in the process of exchanging
personal information to comply with the travel rule in its own
distributed ledger. Each VASP node retrieves travel rule related
data from the connected backend.

Fig. 1. Blockchain-based Travel Rule Compliance System Architecture

To satisfy the travel rule recently speciﬁed in Korean law
[14], the travel rule data exchange process is conducted in
two steps. When originator at VASP 1 is trying to send virtual
asset to beneﬁciary at VASP 2, the ﬁrst step is to provide
the essential personal information, which includes the name
and virtual asset address of originator and beneﬁciary. After
essential personal information is exchanged, virtual assets are
transferred, then the personal and transaction data are stored.
The second step is to provide additional information. If a
previously-executed transfer is determined to be suspicious,
VASP 2 can request the real name conﬁrmation information
of the originator. This information can be resident registration
number, passport number, or alien registration number.

A. Step 1 - Provision of Essential Information

When a customer of VASP 1 requests virtual asset transfer
with beneﬁciary’s virtual asset address, the VASP 1 backend
conﬁrms the customer’s request and delivers the origina-
tor’s and beneﬁciary’s virtual asset addresses to the VASP 1

blockchain node. VASP 1 delivers it to VASP 2, then VASP
2 checks whether the originator information is normal. If the
originator information does not contain abnormality, then the
VASP 2 node brings in the beneﬁciary’s personal information
from the backend and transmits it to VASP 1. When the
exchange of the originator’s and beneﬁciary’s personal infor-
mation is complete, VASP 1 executes virtual asset remittance
and sends transaction information including transaction ID
to VASP 2. After conﬁrming the transaction information,
VASP 2 informs VASP 1 whether the transaction is normal
or not, and if it is normal, conﬁrms the transfer. When a
response is received from the VASP 2 node, travel rule data
including personal information and transaction information of
the originator/beneﬁciary are recorded in the blockchain ledger
by the VASP 1 node.

B. Step 2 - Provision of Additional Information

The beneﬁciary VASP may ask the originator VASP to
provide the originator’s real name conﬁrmation information
when fulﬁlling obligations under the laws, such as Suspicious
Transaction Report (STR) [6]. When suspicious circumstances
are found in the transaction executed by Step 1, VASP 2
requests the originator’s additional information from VASP 1
by considering the information exchanged in the ﬁrst step.
VASP 1 retrieves the originator’s real name information from
the backend and delivers it to VASP 2.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we have presented the design of a blockchain-
based travel rule compliance system to comply with the
FATF’s guidance. This allows VASPs to exchange travel rule
data in a P2P manner for each transaction. Shared personal
information data can be stored and managed securely without
unneeded exposure. In future work, we plan to implement this
system using Corda enterprise distributed ledger system [15].
We also plan to link our system with existing [8–13] travel
rule compliance systems. They are diverse, and the travel rule
cannot be applied using a single protocol in the virtual-asset
market. This makes expanding our system by integrating with
other travel rule systems important.
