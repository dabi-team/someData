Satoshi Nakamoto and the Origins of Bitcoin – 
The Profile of a 1-in-a-Billion Genius 

Jens Ducrée, School of Physical Sciences, Dublin City University, Ireland, email: jens.ducree@dcu.ie 

Abstract 
The mystery about the ingenious creator of Bitcoin concealing behind the pseudonym Satoshi Naka-
moto has been fascinating the global public for more than a decade. Suddenly jumping out of the dark 
in 2008, this persona hurled the decentralized electronic cash system "Bitcoin", which has reached a 
peak market capitalization in the region of 1 trillion USD. In a purposely agnostic, and meticulous "lea-
ving  no  stone  unturned"  approach,  this  study  presents  new  hard  facts,  which  evidently  slipped 
through Satoshi Nakamoto's elaborate privacy shield, and derives meaningful pointers that are prima-
rily inferred from Bitcoin's whitepaper, its blockchain parameters, and data that were widely up to his 
discretion. 

This ample stack of established and novel evidence is systematically categorized, analyzed, and then 
connected to its related, real-world ambient, like relevant locations and happenings in the past, and 
at the time. Evidence compounds towards a substantial role of the Benelux cryptography ecosystem, 
with strong transatlantic links, in the creation of Bitcoin. A consistent biography, a psychogram, and 
gripping  story  of  an  ingenious,  multi-talented,  autodidactic,  reticent,  and  capricious  polymath 
transpire, which are absolutely unique from a history of science and technology perspective. A cohort 
of  previously  fielded  and  best  matches  emerging  from  the  investigations  are  probed  against  an 
unprecedently restrictive, multi-stage exclusion filter, which can, with maximum certainty, rule out 
most "Satoshi Nakamoto" candidates, while some of them remain to be confirmed. 
Short Abstract 
With this article, you will be able to decide who is not, or highly unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto, be 
equipped with an ample stack of systematically categorized evidence and efficient methodologies to 
find suitable candidates, and can possibly unveil the real identity of the creator of Bitcoin - if you want.

Introduction 
Unprecedented Mystery 
The now notorious pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto [1] stands for the remarkable inventor of one of the 
most  ground-breaking  innovations  of  the  ongoing  21st  century:  the  cryptocurrency  [2]  Bitcoin  [3] 
(ticker  symbol  [4]:  BTC)  with  its  underlying  blockchain  [5]  concept;  this  disruptive  technology  has 
enabled the “Web3” [6] by equipping the internet with an innate value layer. Yet, even up after more 
than a decade after its launch in 2008/2009, only little is known about this individual or group, who 
spent extraordinarily sophisticated efforts on hiding his/her/their true identity, biography, and where-
abouts. 

Under  his  alias,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  was  only  interacting  with  the  community  for  about  two  years 
between the second half of 2008 and end of 2010, followed by emails to peers in the following spring, 
before  completely  vanishing  end  of  April  2011  without  clear  farewell  or  guidance  message.  After-
wards, Satoshi Nakamoto appears to have only surfaced with brief statements, one in an attempt to 
stop  a  media-driven  manhunt  for  a  Japanese-American  sharing  his  “name”  [7],  to  dismiss  a  main-
stream  media  hype  [8],  and  to  intervene  in  a  self-destructive  civil  war  raging  within  the  Bitcoin 
community [9]; however, serious doubt has been cast on whether these postings truly originated from 
the elusive architect of Bitcoin [10]; and if not, why would the new owner have only used them so 
sparsely. 
Astonishingly,  the  mastermind  of  a  banking  revolution  has  (so  far)  never  touched  (any  significant 
share) of his rather abundantly filled coffers of digital assets, which are estimated to accrue of the 
order of 1 million Bitcoin (ticker: BTC), and which he is believed to have been hoarded in 2009 as the 
dominant miner on the nascent blockchain; assuming a trading pair of 20,000 US$ / BTC (at the time 
of writing), these holdings roughly correspond to a whopping 20 billion US$, ranking him amongst the 
richest people on the planet. Some pundits forecast a (volatile) growth towards 100,000 US$ / BTC, 
500,000 US$ / BTC, and even 1 million US$ / BTC, which would lift him, possibly before the end of the 
current decade, to the top of the Forbes list of billionaires [11]. 
This  is,  to  the  author’s  best  knowledge,  the  first  time  that  the  inventor  of  a  “unicorn”-like  [12] 
technology, that has reached, along quite a roller-coaster ride, a maximum total value on the range of 
1 trillion US$, has inapprehensibly departed, remained completely anonymous, and stayed abstinent 
from his massive fortune, fame and impact. This behavior utterly contrasts business celebrities like Bill 
Gates [13], Steve Jobs [14], Elon Musk [15], Mark Zuckerberg [16], Jeff Bezos [17], or Jack Dorsey [18] 
in  the  related  IT/Web2.0  [19]  space,  or  prominent  blockchain  pioneers  and  promoters  like  Vitalik 
Buterin [20, 21], Charles Hoskinson [22, 23], Gavin Wood [24, 25], Sam Bankman-Fried [26-28], Roger 
Ver [29], or Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) [30, 31]. 

Quite fascinatingly, and despite the fact that Bitcoin was published and launched, from a historic point 
of view, rather recently in 2008/2009, and still “lives” on the internet, the methodology for unravelling 
its origins tends to resemble more the reconstruction of a long-lost ancient culture, or a cold-case 
criminal investigation [32]; this is surprising in the age of information where data is ostensibly eter-
nalized, and usually leaves an indelible digital trace. The problem is that the search quasi exclusively 
relies on sterile electronic, rather than physical artefacts carrying telling ”dirt”. In this work, traces 
comparable  to  DNA,  fingerprints,  or  clothes  fibers  left  in  crime  scenes  are  retrieved;  and  most 
remarkably, this decisive evidence has been openly available in Bitcoin whitepaper’s and blockchain 
parameters that has been in the public domain from the very beginning of the story. 
Pool of Candidates 
Numerous initiatives aimed to unravel the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto [33-68]. There is a short list 
of credible candidates [69-72], possibly also [73, 74], who are, fairly consensually, considered by the 

crypto community to have been capable of assembling Bitcoin in 2008; all of them, whether still alive 
or prior to their demise, vehemently deny. A wider circle of “suspects” has, more or less seriously, 
been “nominated” [42, 46, 47, 58, 72-93]; however, most experts would severely challenge these their 
involvement in the creation of Bitcoin. Likewise, these contenders have overwhelmingly, and catego-
rically dismissed their involvement. 

Yet, from a group of otherwise quickly debunked self-nominations [94, 95], one Australian-born can-
didate shot up in December 2015; he stubbornly insists having been the main figure in orchestrating 
Bitcoin  [39,  57,  96-100],  and  even  filed  libel  cases  targeting  some  of  those  openly  challenging  his 
inventorship [101-108]. Over recent years, he also filed a large number of blockchain-relevant patents 
[109-111] through his employer [112]. 

A slew of further names has been dropped over the years [15, 58, 83, 85, 113-135], without sustained 
traction, or even consensus. At the end, and despite countless search efforts, we still do not know the 
person(s) behind the alias Satoshi Nakamoto; as a matter of fact, the crypto-community overwhel-
mingly agrees that this  mythical  genesis story bears great benefit for Bitcoin and  its offspring, i.e., 
second- and third-generation blockchains [21, 23, 25, 136-141]. In certain, susceptible communities, 
a (quite concerning) development resembling a quasi-monotheistic [142], sect-like “Church of Satoshi” 
cult, with a narrative alluding to a celestial origin of Bitcoin is observed. 
About the Author 
While having published in the field of blockchain in recent years [143-151], coming from a background 
[152, 153] in physics [154-158] and microsystems engineering [159-164], the author of this article was 
neither pertaining to the cryptographer nor the so-called cypherpunk scene [165-168] during the birth 
of Bitcoin, nor is he affiliated with, or intends to specifically promote any of the potential “Satoshi 
Nakamoto” candidates. However, along his endeavor, the author also had the opportunity to converse 
with select insiders, who tend to be very cagey and reclusive, asking for anonymity in the context of 
this work. 

Furthermore,  the  author’s  multi-decade  experience  with  scientific  publishing  and  the  research 
community  [169,  170],  as  well  as  his  close  interaction  with  the  corporate  sector  and  public 
organizations,  turned out  to  be  a  decisive enabler  for  detecting  the  stack  of new  quality  evidence 
presented here. This auspicious constellation offers the benefit of a rather neutral, as much as possible 
evidence-oriented approach to eventually draft an unbiased and soundly-reasoned Satoshi Nakamoto 
profile. 
Motivation and Methodology 
Solidity of Evidence 

A major part of this work results from turning every stone, some of them revealing exciting stories, 
others do not appear to be leading to anything substantial; still, while resulting in a long article, all 
avenues are documented, underpinned by a plethora of citations, also to empower subsequent re-
search, e.g., by data mining approaches. The length of this paper, and its high level or detail, is crucial 
for a proper scientific methodology; this is because any, at first glance, even miniscule evidence that 
irreconcilably  contradicts  a  given  “Satoshi  Nakamoto”  hypothesis  immediately  annihilates  such  a 
binary identity claim in its entirety. The particular selection and dismissal of Satoshi Nakamoto candi-
dates that will be examined in this work reflects this exclusion strategy. 

All evidence, such as metadata from postings with their timestamps [171], time zones [172], Internet 
Protocol (IP) [173] addresses [174], and their linked geographical locations, leave a certain chance of 
having been manipulated by the inventor of Bitcoin, especially when originating from the digital and 
online arena. Still, some fresh “analog” evidence has been carved out, which has obviously slipped 
past Satoshi Nakamoto’s highly refined privacy screen, and which has, quite startingly, been widely 

overlooked in previous investigations; these new snippets mostly concern the conspicuous collection 
of citations in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], and the circumstances of the Bitcoin genesis block [176, 
177], which are carefully examined and put into context in this investigation. 
Traces in Numbers? 

In addition, further contributions to the story presented here are derived from the name, and, as per 
the common crypto-motto “Vires in Numeris” (English: “strength in numbers”), numbers and dates 
set, with a significant extent of discretion, by Satoshi Nakamoto, and their connection to the creation 
of the Bitcoin blockchain and its contemporary and historical embedding. It may certainly be argued 
whether these are, on the one hand, overinterpretations of unintended coincidences, or, on the other 
hand,  deliberately  placed  breadcrumbs,  e.g.,  for  humoristic  purposes,  for  encouraging  a  (mostly 
virtual)  “Indiana  Jones”  [178]  or  “Da  Vinci  Code”  [179]  like  treasure  hunt  similar  to  cryptograms 
familiar from notorious pirate stories [180], or crime [181]. The relevance of such, at first ostensibly 
weak indirect evidence [182], tends to consolidate when occurring in multiple independent contexts. 
Benefits of Foundational Mystery 

The search for Satoshi Nakamoto also resembles the deciphering of cultural puzzles or understanding 
the objectives pursued, and techniques utilized by historic civilizations for constructing monuments, 
e.g., prehistoric Stonehenge [183], The Egyptian Pyramids [184, 185], Nabataean Petra [186, 187], and 
others [188-198], or the provenance of, or methods for forming, the relics like the Shroud of Turin 
[199], the Seamless robe of Jesus [200], or the Shrine of the Three Kings [201]. At times, the author is 
even  further  jinxed  by  his  fascination  for  the  origin  of  Bitcoin,  irresistibly  prompting  him  to  draw 
parallels to scouring for the historic root of old stories, such as the (fictional) island of Atlantis [202], 
the medieval saga of Rheingold [203], King Arthur [204], or the famed search for the Holy Grail [179, 
205-207]. People may spot further allegories [208] in Satoshi Nakamoto’s writings, and even venture 
to find parallels to the still perplexing, medieval-age prophecies by Nostradamus [209], and delve into 
their manifold options for their interpretation. But this, of course, stretching it extremely / too far. 

However, while the Bitcoin story unfolded in the present digital era, literally in front of our eyes, and 
Bitcoin technology is fully understood [210, 211], progressively advanced and increasingly utilized in 
the real world, the story of its beginnings, and the very peculiar mindset of its ingenious creator(s) 
may remain cloaked in eternal obscurity. 

It is highly doubtful whether this was part of his ploy, but, at the end of the day, and in addition to 
removing a single point of failure by pivotal decentralization, the foundational mystery has also suc-
ceeded as a priceless marketing strategy for Bitcoin itself, and its crypto-descendants; it also lifted 
Satoshi Nakamoto to the top celebrity amongst core internet technologists, making him even better 
recognized in the general public than, for instance, Tim Berners-Lee (“TimBL”) [212], the key figure 
behind the World Wide Web (WWW) [213]. 
Unique Methodology 

Alternative to most other investigations on the creator of Bitcoin, this study avoids starting out with a 
specific  candidate,  and  then  exclusively  presenting  evidence  supporting  their  hypothesis,  while 
putting a blind eye on inconsistencies. Instead, an outline of a Satoshi Nakamoto persona, including 
prerequisites and elimination criteria underpinned by best evidence, is agnostically developed, before 
screening this template against known and newly identified public figures. 
Note that due to the striking rarity of material in the form of vigorously peer-reviewed papers that are 
the best-practice in scientific publishing, the author decided to include (a subset of) the abundance of 
webpages  and  online  feeds  that  have  been  produced  over  time,  entirely  independently  from  this 
work; these sources can, unfortunately, seldomly be properly validated, and may even be susceptible 
to  manipulation,  e.g.,  by  Satoshi  Nakamoto  himself,  by  an  imposter,  his  promoters,  opponents, or 

investors. Furthermore, insiders or confidants are apparently not inclined to come out of the woods 
to tell the story, or not even to expose Faketoshis, because they may be happy to leave the public in 
the dark, and protect their own, and potentially also Satoshi Nakamoto's privacy. 
Hence, in absence of “smoking guns” or “caught in the acts” type of direct, eyewitness evidence, this 
article is poking in deep and muddy open waters for a treasure not meant to be found, so, unavoidably, 
numerous modifiers such as “likely”, “probably”, “possibly”, “presumably”, “apparently”, “supposed-
ly”, “seemingly”, “ostensibly”, “hypothetically”, “theoretically”, “maybe”, and “perhaps” are spread 
throughout the text. 

Even  though  some  circumstantial  evidence  presented  here  are  unlikely  to  have  been  intended  by 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  at  the  time,  they  are  an  essential  part  of  the  “every  stone  turned”  approach 
vigorously pursued in this investigation. Also, historic correlations to certain forgotten techniques and 
historic events may often seem to be farfetched at first sight, but the methodology for developing 
lines of argument, to rank alternative interpretations according to their likeliness in order to arrive at 
the most plausible hypothesis definitely applies to the quest for the origins of Bitcoin. 
Objectives 
This study is mainly motivated from a history of science and technology perspective, following the 
overall objective [214] “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Further-
more, the  idea  that  this  game-changing,  potential  “person of the  century” may  (hopefully)  still  be 
among us, like a “guy next door”, is definitely enthralling. A celebrity with a similar quest for anonymity 
is known in the scene of contemporary street art uses the pseudonym “Banksy” [215]. 
Real-World Impact 
From a practical point of view, Satoshi Nakamoto’s biography, personality, motivations, and concerns 
derived  here  may  substantially  contribute  to  a  sound  risk  analysis  on  the  future  of  Bitcoin  and 
cryptocurrencies,  e.g.,  regarding  the  flooding  of  the  market  with  early  mined  BTC  [216],  copyright 
[217]  and  other  intellectual  property  [218]  matters.  However,  more  than  a  decade  after  Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s  (online)  disappearance,  the  fields  of  blockchain  and  cryptocurrency  have  considerably 
moved  on,  and  thus  became  widely  autonomous,  and  technically  detached  from  its  enigmatic 
founding father. 
Number of References 

As the subject of Bitcoin and its origins is of highly interdisciplinary nature, the reader is referred to a 
rather  unusually  comprehensive,  at  first  glance,  excessive  collection  of  explanatory  webpages, 
primarily to (the English-language version of) Wikipedia [219]. It is fully understood that the resulting, 
vast number of citations that are decorating the text might slightly impair the reading experience; yet 
the author prefers to properly define topics. Furthermore, unraveling the enormous conundrum of 
the origin of Bitcoin is, and will be decisively boosted, by systematic collection of even the slightest 
cues,  and  aided  by  advanced  data  mining  [220]  the  comprehensive  repertoire  of  circumstantial 
evidence, e.g., in conjunction with (more advanced) semantic web [221] / knowledge graphs [222] 
technologies, machine learning [223], and artificial intelligence (AI) [224] services [225-229].  
Date and Time Format 
Note  that  unless  specified  otherwise,  the  (European)  date  format  DD/MM/YYYY  [230]  is  used 
 day, depending on the 
throughout the text and references; note that specified dates may vary by 
local time zone [231], and whether standard [232], or daylight savings time (DST) [233] are applied 
during summer in the respective global hemisphere [234, 235]. Consider that whether and when an 
entire country, or  its  individual  federal  states and regions, switch between  standard and “summer 
time” (DST) might vary, and their routine may have changed over the years [236, 237].  

±1

While the digital world utilizes coordinated universal time (UTC) [238], e.g., to avoid complications 
around  DST  [233],  considerations  of  events  in  local  time  zones  [231],  with  Greenwich  Mean  Time 
(GMT) [239] as default, are of outstanding importance to this study; at the end of the day, Satoshi 
Nakamoto  is  a  human  being  whose  chronobiology  [240],  i.e.,  biological  rhythm  (“clock”),  makes 
activity during daylight hours most natural. Note that the time zone specified on postings on curated 
newsgroups are typically imprinted by the corresponding clock setting of their (central) server, i.e., 
typically to the time zone of their own, and not the sender’s geolocation. Moreover, select time zones 
run split, e.g., 30- [241-246] or 45-minute [247-249], rather than integer-hour offsets with respect to 
UTC [238]. 
Structure or Article 
Evolution of Bitcoin 

This work starts with a survey of the evolution of Bitcoin over the period when Satoshi Nakamoto was 
actively involved in Bitcoin between 2007/2008 and 2010/2011. Furthermore, possible scientific and 
ideological backgrounds of Bitcoin in the cryptography research [250] and cypherpunk [165] commu-
nities are introduced. Afterwards, the financial, legal and personal that might have impacted Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s path to, and away from Bitcoin is outlined. 
Bitcoin Whitepaper 
As a pivotal element of this study, the Bitcoin whitepaper is carefully screened; as a result, novel, hard 
evidence  emerges,  in  particular  from  its,  at  second  look,  somewhat  bizarre  list  of  citations  and 
metadata.  The  various  cues  discovered  might  have  slipped  through  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  otherwise 
very efficient, cunningly designed shield of anonymity. 
Bitcoin Dates 

Next, the calendric dates of the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper and the start of the Bitcoin block-
chain with block 0 and 1 are examined for potential correlations and their respective interpretations 
in the context of the origins of Bitcoin. 
Personality and Bio 

Then, key fragments of Satoshi Nakamoto’s character, professional and private vita are plotted from 
a diverse pool of information. While incorporating numerous existing findings, this effort is substan-
tially supported by methodical analysis of the free parameters the creator of Bitcoin had available for 
his pseudonym, his self-defined date and place of birth, as well as his clever and wide-ranging strategy 
for privacy and anonymity. 
Blockchain Parameters 

In the following, the Bitcoin blockchain is scrutinized for the parameters Satoshi Nakamoto could deli-
berately choose across a rather wide range of potential values. Variation of the eventually hardcoded 
settings is tested to check whether the reasoning of the number is purely technically reasoned, or may 
contain  hidden  messages.  The  theoretically  less  interested  reader  may  fast-forward  through  the 
rather mathematical content to the last subsection delivering the take-home messages. 
Telling Numbers? 

The subsequent section, for the first time, makes a best effort to interpretate the previously gained 
cues within the framework of math, alphanumeric systems, geometry, symbolism, history, and the 
sciences. Especially the numbers 21, and also 42, appear to act as pointers, e.g., to pertinent locations 
and events. However, if not entirely incidental, these wittily “encrypted” pieces are undoubtedly not 
meant to disclose Satoshi Nakamoto’s formal identity; they rather seem to reflect his propensity for 
playing  droll  “brain  games”  and  riddles  with  his  audiences;  such  inclination  is  not  uncommon  for 

ingenious  minds,  and  reveal  facets  of  his  attitude  when  conceiving,  giving  birth,  nurturing,  and 
weaning off his baby Bitcoin. 
Final Sections 
Afterwards, the complex and multilayer stock of known and newly uncovered circumstantial evidence 
is thoroughly categorized. The most substantial parts of this assortment are wrapped around a scaffold 
to  assemble  a  likely  biography  and  psychogram  of  the  individual  concealing  behind  the  moniker 
Satoshi Nakamoto. Next, a multi-stage sieving method composed of “Satoshiness” criteria is devised, 
and ultimately applied to best, potentially surprising matches immediately arising from this work, and 
various already circulating nominations. 
Appendix 

An extended range of possibly relevant happenings in the context of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin 
regarding history, politics, economy, finance, money, society, art, science and sports during key years 
for Bitcoin is compiled in the Appendix. Its final section collects fun facts about the potential meanings 
of numbers highlighted in this investigation. 

The Birth and Infancy of Bitcoin 
Hitting the Surface 
In July / August 2008, and thus just a few weeks prior to its launch, a “Satoshi Nakamoto” lunged, 
seemingly out of nowhere, onto the cryptographer scene when ostensibly finishing up his now famous 
Bitcoin  whitepaper  [175];  he  used  email  addresses  from  highly  privacy-oriented  service  providers 
[251-256], and found a way to incognito register the domain bitcoin.org [60, 257, 258] on 18 August 
2008.  Yet,  interacting  under  a  pseudonym  was,  and  continues  to  be  quite  common  in  online  fora, 
especially amongst cryptographers. 
Whitepaper 

Around these days in July / August 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto contacted key stakeholders [60, 259-267] 
about prior art and their proper citation in the field of digital currencies [268-272], which he was, if 
not part of a crafty plot, not (fully) aware of at that time [272, 273]. He stated that “I actually did this 
kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every 
problem, then I wrote the paper” [274], that he contends to have been working on Bitcoin for about 
1.5 years, i.e., since 2007 [275]. He stated “Much more of the work was designing than coding.” [276] 
and ”Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate 
it to” [277, 278]. 
On Friday, 31 October 2008 [279] at 14:10:00 EDT [233, 280], i.e., on a weekend-spirited early evening 
hour in European [281] time zones [231, 239], the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] was publicly announced 
[282] on the “cryptography - The Cryptography and Cryptography Policy Mailing List” [283] maintained 
by metzdowd.com [284]. The posting featured a text-based abstract, with double-spacing after the 
period [285], and a download link [175] to the PDF [286] file deposited at bitcoin.org [257]. The two 
spaces  after  full  stop  routine  also  seems  to  have  been  implemented  throughout  the  Bitcoin 
whitepaper, even though the word processor would automatically adjust such gaps. 
Name Bitcoin 
It has been conjectured that due to their very concept and fabric the name Bitcoin might have been 
inspired by its (arguable) precursors “Bit Gold” [71, 262], or “BitTorrent” [287-289]. If this was the 
case, it is very remarkable that both are not cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper. 

Launch of Bitcoin 

The initial reception of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] on this cryptography list [283] in November 2008 
was overwhelmingly skeptical; only a handful of early adopters [70, 290-295] reacted during the first 
couple of weeks; even fewer programmers joined Satoshi Nakamoto in developing Bitcoin [70, 118, 
294, 296-300] in this nascent period, and often bowed out quite soon. The Bitcoin source code files 
were shared by Satoshi Nakamoto on 16/11/2008 [66, 301]. 

On Saturday, 03/01/2009 at 6:15 pm GMT [302], the Bitcoin blockchain was kicked off with the Genesis 
block 0 [177, 302], which included the headline “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second 
bailout for banks” [176] of the British newspaper “The Times” [303, 304]. Block 1 [305] was mined on, 
depending on the time zone [231], 08 or 09/01/2009 at 2:54 AM GMT [239], i.e., after a, so far, not 
conclusively explained, six-day hiatus. 

Bitcoin v0.1 was released on Thursday, 08/01/2009 [306-308] at 14:27:40 EST [280] (i.e., 19:27 GMT 
[239]), and on Wednesday, 11/02/2009 [309] (without time of the day) at P2P Foundation [310] for 
download  on  SourceForge [311]  and  bitcoin.org  [257], respectively; nowadays, the code resides at 
GitHub [312, 313]. Satoshi Nakamoto mentioned on the same day at bitcoin-list along the release of 
Bitcoin version 0.1.2 “… I wasn't able to test it in the wild until now” [314]. Note the telling “I” in this 
statement; if Bitcoin has been invented by a team, it would certainly have made great sense to resort 
to it as a multi-eyed testbed. 

On the 11/01/2009 at 03:33 am, cypherpunk and early contributor Hal Finney [70, 315, 316] deposited 
his now famous tweet “Running Bitcoin”  [317], making him the, most likely, the second miner after 
Satoshi Nakamoto. On 12/01/2009 at 03:30 (am?) [318], Finney received the first transaction of 10 
BTC (i.e., input 50 BTC, output: 10 BTC to Hal, change of 40 BTC to a new Bitcoin address generated by 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  in  the  UTXO  model)  from  Satoshi  Nakamoto,  mined  in  block  170  [319].  On 
21/01/2009 at 05:29 pm, Finney added “Looking at ways to add more anonymity to bitcoin” [320], 
and  on  27/01/2009  at  08:14  pm,  he  uttered,  very  presciently  [321-323],  “Thinking  about  how  to 
reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation” [324]. 
Bitcoin.org 

The  domain  was  originally  owned  by  Bitcoin's  first  two  developers,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  and  Martti 
Malmi [296]. After leaving the project, Satoshi Nakamoto transferred ownership of bitcoin.org to addi-
tional  people,  some  of  them  separate  from  the  Bitcoin  developers,  to  spread  responsibility  and 
prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control over the Bitcoin project [325]. 
From 2011 to 2013, the site was primarily used for releasing new versions of the software now called 
Bitcoin  Core.  In  2013,  the  site  was  redesigned,  adding  numerous  pages,  listing  additional  Bitcoin 
software, and creating the translation system [325]. 
To the author’s best knowledge, bitcoin.org was moved to “Louhi Net Oy” [326] in Finland [327] on 18 
May 2011 [328], then registered to “WhoisGuard” [329] in Panama [330] on 2016-12-26 [331-333], 
and on 2021-09-23 [334] to “namecheap” [335] to with a country tag from Iceland [336]. 
Bitcoin Community 

Satoshi  Nakamoto  continued  to  actively  participate  in  discussion  and  development,  e.g.,  on  the 
cryptography mailing list [283], BitcoinTalk.org [337], or the P2P Foundation [338, 339]. About a year 
after its birth, on 22 November 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto started the BitcoinTalk.org forum [337, 340]. 
The community helped with improvements and bug fixes of the code, e.g., the notorious “overflow 
bug” [341] that created more than 184 billion (!) BTC in block 74,638 of 10/08/2010 (before being 
corrected  only  5  hours  later  by  a  soft  fork).  Around  mid-2010,  he  successively  handed  over  the 
responsibility of the Bitcoin project. 

Departure 
On  12/12/2010  [342-346],  i.e.,  after  roughly  two  years,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  unexpectedly  and 
unglamorously disappeared from all online fora with a rather inconspicuous posting “There’s more 
work  to  do  on  DoS,  but  I’m  doing  a  quick  build  of  what  I  have  so  far  in  case  it’s  needed,  before 
venturing into  more  complex  ideas”  [343]. By then, Satoshi Nakamoto had transferred the control 
over the Bitcoin project, e.g., bitcoin.org [257, 258, 328], to his trusted peers, which indicates a longer, 
and well-planned, gradual exodus, rather than a spontaneous emotional decision, or personal acci-
dent. His last forum posting does also not (directly) hint to a clinical cut, Satoshi Nakamoto rather just 
wanted to fade away, probably to avoid turmoil or begging to stay by the budding Bitcoin community. 
Even though highly speculative, this plot somewhat insinuates ascension narratives [347] as a central 
pillar supporting the origin myths [348] of various religions [349]. In that sense (of humor?), will there 
be, one day, a Second Coming [350] of the founder of Bitcoin? 

Satoshi Nakamoto still continued sending emails [351, 352] for a short while to early contributors and 
trustees  like  Gavin  Andresen  [75],  Mike  Hearn  [351,  353-355]  and  Martti  Malmi  [296],  who  took 
charge of bitcoin.org [257, 258, 356]. Here are excerpts from of the final messages in April / May 2011. 
•  Mike Hearn to Satoshi Nakamoto on 20/04/2011 [351]: “Are you planning on rejoining the 
community at some point (e.g., for code reviews), or is your plan to permanently step back 
from the limelight?”, Satoshi Nakamoto: “I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands 
with Gavin and everyone.” 

•  Satoshi Nakamoto to Gavin Andersen in 26/04/2011 [357]: “I wish you wouldn’t keep talking 
about  me  as  a  mysterious  shadowy  figure,  the  press  just  turns  that  into  a  pirate  currency 
angle. Maybe instead make it about the open-source project and give more credit to your dev 
contributors; it helps motivate them.”  

•  Satoshi Nakamoto to Martti Malmi in early May 2011 [358]: “I’ve moved on to other things 

and probably won’t be around in the future.”  

From his follow-on email communication with select peers, it appears that Satoshi Nakamoto wanted 
to  mature  his  still  nascent  baby  “Bitcoin”  within  its  small  developer  community,  and  was  strongly 
opposed, and apparently even scared of enhanced public exposure; this attitude manifested when 
Bitcoin was eyed by Wikileaks [346, 358-362] as a potential vehicle for bypassing its financial blockage 
in early 2011: “It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked 
the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” He was also concerned when the CIA [363] 
invited an informative meeting on Bitcoin, where Gavin Andresen [75] presented in mid-2011. 
On Sunday, 26 April 2011 [357, 363, 364], Gavin Andresen informed fellow coders: “Satoshi did suggest 
this morning that I (we) should try to de-emphasize the whole ‘mysterious founder’ thing when talking 
publicly about bitcoin.” After this day, Satoshi Nakamoto stopped replying, even to personal emails of 
his inner circle. Bitcoin enthusiasts pondered somberly why Satoshi Nakamoto had departed.  

Yet,  by  then,  his  epic  invention  had  become  adolescent,  within  a  self-sovereign  group  of  active 
supporters. Part of Bitcoin’s long-term sustained success is often attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto’s 
conservative  strategy  of  deploying  rather  well-established  and  thoroughly  field-tested  methods 
developed in the 1970s-1990s [365], instead of resorting to highly advanced, but still experimental 
cryptographic techniques. 

A potential factor of Satoshi Nakamoto’s, at least from an outside perspective, incomprehensible exit 
might  have  also  been  that  mailing  lists  are tough  to cope with  for  the  faint  hearted;  for  instance, 
rudeness, lack of respect, and strong opinions without leaving room for compromise have led later to 
the notorious Bitcoin “civil war”, which drove out some early key stakeholders [75, 353], who both 
directly conversed (through text messages) with Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Gavin Andresen [75] described Satoshi Nakamoto as “a brilliant coder, but it was quirky” [366]. Others 
believed that Nakamoto might have been a group: Dan Kaminsky [367], a highly accomplished security 
researcher, who competently scrutinized the Bitcoin code, stated that Nakamoto could either be a 
"team of people", or must definitely have been a "genius"; a former Bitcoin core developer, Laszlo 
Hanyecz [368], also known for the first real-world purchase by Bitcoin [369, 370], uttered the feeling 
“Bitcoin  seems  awfully  well  designed  for  one  person  to  crank  out”  [364].  One  of  the  first  Bitcoin 
adopters, Hal Finney [70, 315], who emailed Satoshi Nakamoto and helped him early on with the code, 
is quoted: “I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and 
sincere.  I've  had  the  good  fortune  to  know  many  brilliant  people  over  the  course  of  my  life,  so  I 
recognize the signs” [52, 315]. 

There were some later messages [7-9, 371, 372] sent by Satoshi Nakamoto via email or postings on, 
but their genuineness remains seriously disputed, as his associated online accounts might have been 
compromised, or simply repossessed after certain idle periods [373]. Yet, it would be worth contem-
plating why potential hackers did not make even more use of their power to speak in the name of 
Satoshi Nakamoto for the sake of their own interests, e.g., to unite or seriously damage the Bitcoin 
project, or to manipulate cryptocurrency markets. 

The  talismanic  father  of  Bitcoin  is  assumed  to  have  been  a  dominant  miner  in  the  first  year  2009 
according  to  the  so-called  “Patoshi  patterns”  [216,  374,  375].  The  creator  of  Bitcoin  chose  not  to 
include further messages in the blocks he succeeded to mine, such as the headline of “The Times” 
[303,  304]  he  engraved  in  the  genesis  block  0  [177,  302],  or  in  transactions  issued  from  Bitcoin 
addresses attributed to him [374]; this alternative texting mechanism is enabled by his blockchain’s 
intrinsic scripting language, while preserving his pseudonymity. Most remarkably, Satoshi Nakamoto 
seems to have never moved any (significant number of) coins, at least not from his about 1 million 
BTC  he  is  firmly  believed  to  have mined  in  2009  [376]  (but  possibly  from  other  addresses  that  he 
generated afterwards). 
Ideology 
Cypherpunk Movement 
From his very motivation to engage into the monster effort of creating Bitcoin, as well as from his 
interactions  with  the  community,  it  can  be  inferred  that  Satoshi  Nakamoto  was  distinctively  con-
temptuous of the legacy financial system, as expressed with the release of the code [362], and by the 
citation in the genesis block. It is unknown whether he fully subscribed to the more extreme ideologies 
[377], which were a signature of the cypherpunk [165-168] movement: libertarianism [378], crypto 
anarchism [93, 166, 379], and Austrian economics [380]. 

His libertarian attitude shines through rather rarely, e.g., in postings like [381] “Yes, [we will not find 
a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and 
gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a 
centrally controlled network like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be 
holding their own.” on 07/11/2008 [382], and [383] “It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if 
we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though.” on 14/11/2008. His lead 
motive for developing Bitcoin appears to be his lack of trust in banks [310, 339]. 
However, an overly evangelistic approach is widely missing in his whitepaper and forum postings; they 
mainly feature a very rational and respectful, perhaps somewhat ideals-driven, and altruistic “techie”. 
Satoshi Nakamoto mostly engaged in factual expert discussion, rather than primarily acting as a com-
mercially  minded  entrepreneur,  or  hot-headed  preacher  for  the  cypherpunk  ideology.  Whether 
intuitively or tactically, Satoshi Nakamoto did not boast about his own, early miners’ future wealth 

when extrapolating the potential value curve of BTC; a merely financial, capitalist-spirited investor or 
businessman might not have been able to resist emphasizing this “selfish” aspect. 
Anguilla Meeting 
About 200 stakeholders of promoting of the new digital currency system e-Gold [384, 385] wanted to 
develop a strategy that could challenge central banks. They met in February 2000 [386, 387] at Anguilla 
[388], a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean [389]. E-Gold folded in 2007 after its founders were 
indicted [390] by the United States Justice Department [391]. In accordance with the recent analysis 
of  his  motivation,  skeptics  argue  that  Satoshi  Nakamoto  lacked  bias  in  implementing  his  new 
technology [53]. 
Mysterious “X” 

A number of libertarian-minded statements were posted on 9 & 10 December 2002 by an entity “X” 
under  the  topic  “Virtual  peer  to  peer  banking”  on  the  Usenet  [392]  groups  alt.internet.p2p  and 
uk.finance [393, 394]. Their later (re-)discovery in the context of the origins of Bitcoin sparked fiery 
speculation on Reddit [395] and Bitcointalk [396] whether these postings originated from the person 
later filing under the pseudonym “Satoshi” Nakamoto” [34]. 

Indeed, the text bits [397-399] “idea of a future with virtual peer to peer banking”, “fixed total amount 
of money”,” virtual coin”, “deflation would replace inflation”, “community can bypass the old powers 
(countries and governments)”, “new p2p system”, ”current monetary systems were mainly backed 
with gold”, “virtual peer to peer system could be other scarce resources, relatively easy to exchange 
via internet”, “computer processing power, bandwidth and data storage”, “virtual currency”, “replace 
the  system  operator  by  a  secure  peer  to  peer  system”,  “replace  the  underlying  currency  with 
something else, or slowly uncouple the underlying currency” exhibit many attitudes, objectives and 
technical features that entered Bitcoin a few years later in 2008/2009. Whether “X” was the individual 
later masquerading as “Satoshi Nakamoto” could (so far) not be verified. The posts of “X” were traced 
back [34] to IP addresses [174] in the Netherlands [400, 401], i.e., part of Benelux [401], and thus put 
the spotlight on some regional cryptographers [77, 113, 402, 403]. 

Privacy 
Highly gifted mathematical people, who are distinctly concerned about preserving their privacy, are 
often instinctively drawn into the fascinating field of cryptography [250]. Other than the general public 
who are mostly careless of how comprehensively data on their internet-connected devices and online 
activities  are  systematically  tracked,  analyzed,  and  monetized,  cryptographers  tend  to  be  highly 
competent  in  protecting  their  data,  and  to  efficiently  conceal  their  (online)  identity  [404-410]. 
Measures of cover up, such as the registration of web domains and email addresses by fake names 
and addresses, like in the case of Satoshi Nakamoto, as well as air-gaped data storage, are believed to 
be part of their basic technical skillset. 
Distrust in Banking System 
In his announcement of Bitcoin on the P2P Foundation [338], Satoshi Nakamoto clearly expressed his 
pronounced distrust in the traditional, central-bank issued money [339]: 
“The root problem with  conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make  it work.  The 
central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the background of fiat currencies [411] 
is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, 
but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them 
with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead 
costs make micropayments impossible.” 

It is important to consider that profound skepticism for the loose-handed monetary policies of central 
banks, the lax credit policies of lenders that fueled the immense subprime credit mortgage crisis, and 
the casino mentality of investment banking was not exclusive to libertarians and cypherpunks, but 
quite prevalent across societies at the time. 
Cryptography 
International Community 

Major stakeholders in the cryptographer community are from the USA [50, 73, 80, 81, 122, 412-426], 
Canada [427, 428], Europe [281, 429] with the Benelux [113, 430-435], UK [436-440], Switzerland [423, 
441, 442], Germany [122, 443-445], Denmark [446, 447]), and Israel [418, 436, 448-451], as well as, 
for instance, India [452], China [453] and Japan [454] in Asia [455, 456], and Australia [457, 458].  
Significant crypto-expertise may also be found outside the academically dominated habitat, e.g., in 
nation states and their secret service and (anti-)cybercrime [459] organizations [460, 461], computer 
hardware and software giants (e.g., IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, Oracle, SAP, Hitachi, 
NTT), or special-interest groups like cypherpunks [165] and hackers [462]. 
E-Cash 

While  the  topic  was  not  prevalent  in  the  cryptographer  community,  electronic  cash  systems  were 
sporadically published [417, 436, 463-484] in the cryptography community after its introduction [485] 
by David Chaum [73, 486] in the early 1980s. Interestingly, in the global mix of affiliations, a striking 
accumulation of authorships from Japan can be observed for the pre-Bitcoin period, most eminently 
from the team of Tatsuaki Okamoto [487-489] at NTT [490] in the neighborhood of the 1990s. 
CRYPTO Conference Series 
It has been said that the cohort of top cryptographers equipped with the competence to launch Bitcoin 
at the time was rather small, estimated to a few hundred people worldwide [425, 491]. They con-
ceivably belong to the network gathering at the annual “CRYPTO” flagship meeting that takes place at 
Santa Barbara [492], California [493], and its continental and more specialized offspring [429, 456] 
organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) [494]. Note, however, that 
papers  related  to  digital  cash /  cryptocurrencies  were  occasionally  presented  [463,  467,  469,  470, 
478], and probably discussed informally, but not a major session title on the official agenda of such 
conventions, particularly not those predating Bitcoin. 

Still, it is worth mentioning that IACR was founded, and CRYPTO conference series was inaugurated 
by  electronic  cash  pioneer  David  Chaum  [73,  486,  495]  in  1981  [486,  496,  497].  The  legendary 
cypherpunk Hal Finney [70] presented on Reusable Proof-of-Work (RPOW) [316] (his attempt towards 
a cryptocurrency [315]) at a 2004 “Rump” session” [498]. Finney mention in 2005 RPOW as “a sort of 
play-money form of digital cash, an implementation of Nick Szabo's [71] concept of bit gold [262]" 
[499]. 
Possibly relevant in the context of “Satoshi Nakamoto”, teams from academic and corporate Japan 
are have been presenting at the annual CRYPTO meetings [500-504], and occasionally collaborating 
with its Western stakeholders; as not uncommon in Japan [454], a good portion of their names contain 
fractions  /  syllables  like  “-(a)toshi”  and  “-(k)(a)moto”,  and  even  the  first  name  “Satoshi”  appears. 
While,  for  several  reasons,  the  individual  behind  Satoshi  Nakamoto  is  unlikely  to  have  Japanese 
nationality, his pseudonym might still have been inspired by such names to plausibly distract attention 
from his true place of residence. 
CRYPTO & Bitcoin 

A  vast  majority  of  the  (senior)  authors  cited  in  its  whitepaper  [124,  419,  425,  426],  of  those  who 
contributed essential cryptographic methods [70, 73] for enabling Bitcoin, or who play a certain role 
in  the  unfolding  story  of  this  article  [80,  442,  446,  450,  505,  506],  were  (pre-Bitcoin)  presenters, 

program committee or IACR [494] fellows [507] / board members / directors [508] / presidents, or 
accomplished veterans of the CRYPTO conference spectrum [74, 80, 81, 417, 420, 436, 441, 442, 448, 
450, 495, 509-519].  
Wider Context 
Satoshi Nakamoto’s personal state of mind during the inception, creation, release, and maturation of 
Bitcoin  along  the  years  2007-2010  might  have  been  affected  by  other  preceding  and  concurrent 
happenings in the domains of finance, law, and the personal ambient, that were, occasionally, less 
prominent in the mainstream media. For drafting his overall psychogram, also select, post-2010 events 
ought to be considered for Satoshi Nakamoto’s fairly abrupt, and still perplexing departure from the 
project. Note that the events mentioned in the following are primarily viewed from an angle coined 
by the Western / US-American / British / European culture. 
Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 
The harbingers of the global financial crisis [520] are ascribed to events that took place in August 2007 
in the world of banking [521], which may well have triggered Satoshi Nakamoto’s work on Bitcoin. This 
severe crisis further escalated during the year 2008 [522], peaking, in the public perception, with the 
filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection [523] by Lehmann Brothers [524], the fourth-largest invest-
ment bank in the United States [525], on 15 September 2008 [526]. 
Legal Cases 
Bernstein v. United States 

The  notorious  Bernstein  v.  United  States  series  of  court  cases  (1995-2003)  [527]  revolved  about 
publication, and resulting export of cryptography technology from the United States, and the right 
guaranteeing  freedom  of  speech  as  protected  by  the  First  Amendment  [528]  of  the  United  States 
Constitution [529]. The plaintiff, Daniel J. Bernstein [122], has already been a top-notch cryptographer 
in the 2000s, i.e. the years preceding Bitcoin. 

The court initially ruled that software source code was speech and that the governmental regulations 
preventing its publication were unconstitutional; then the case was reopened, and, on 15 October 
2003 [530], i.e., after almost nine years, the judge eventually dismissed the case; Bernstein, who then 
represented himself, was asked to return when the government posed a "concrete threat".  
Napster & Megaupload 

Satoshi Nakamoto also referred to Napster [531, 532] that was founded as an independent peer-to-
peer file sharing service in 1999. The legal challenges spearheaded by the music industry led to its 
shutdown in 2001. Similar court cases were emerging at the time [533]. Legally related centralization 
issues of Napster were referred to by Satoshi Nakamoto [381] only a week after the release of his 
Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. 
Currency & Securities 

Satoshi  Nakamoto  might  also  have  been  aware  that  the  issuance  of  a  cryptocurrency  might  bring 
about  certain  legal  matters,  for  instance,  with  the  (US)  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC) 
[534], and with Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 of the US Constitution on the “Coinage Power of Congress” 
[535], or their international equivalents. 
Wikileaks 

In 2006, the whistleblower website WikiLeaks [359] was started, presumedly by Julian Assange [360, 
536]. In 2007, the platform published the standard US army protocol at Guantanamo Bay [537]. There 
were further releases of classified papers in the pre-Bitcoin period 2006-2008 [538] and beyond, such 
as the disclosure of the 2010 "Iraq War Logs" [539] and "Afghan War Diary" [540] leading to imprison-

ment of  the whistleblower  Chelsea  Manning [541], who was assigned  as  intelligence analyst to an 
Army unit in Iraq in 2009. 

The financial blockade of WikiLeaks in 2010/2011 triggered a discussion, including whether the Bitcoin 
community should promote  BTC  as  alternative for funding in early 2011 (which  eventually  did not 
materialize).  The  ensuing  public  exposure  and  scrutiny  of  the  infant  Bitcoin  project  seriously  con-
cerned  by  Satoshi  Nakamoto  [362],  and  might  even  have  prompted  his  gradual  withdrawal, 
culminating with his final emails in April 2011 [357]. 
Silk Road 

In February 2011, and pertaining to the dark web [542], the online black market and the first modern 
darknet market website “Silk Road” [543] was started; operated as a Tor [408] hidden service, plat-
form attracted approximately 100,000 users. The FBI [544] shuttered the website in October 2014, 
and arrested its alleged founder Ross Ulbricht [119], alias "Dread Pirate Roberts". Satoshi Nakamoto 
occasionally pointed out that he did not want himself and Bitcoin to be associated with moral or eco-
nomic  “shadiness”.  These  happenings  might  well  have  deepened  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  choice  for 
silence and anonymity over the years to come until now. Notably, there were reports about an alleged 
ties between Satoshi Nakamoto and the founder of Silk Road [545].  
Keccak-SHA-3 Controversy 

In November 2007, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [422] launched a 
competition to develop a new hash function called SHA-3 to complement the older SHA-1 and SHA-2 
[546]. On October 2, 2012, NIST announced KECCAK [547] as the winning algorithm to be standardized 
as the new SHA-3 [548]. In the follow-up, a “weakening controversy” [549] emerged in the crypto-
grapher community, even including claims that a backdoor was introduced [550-552] in light of the 
documents leaked by the former NSA [460] employee and contractor Edward Snowden [121, 553] in 
2013. As already revealed in the discussion regarding the invited presentation of Bitcoin to the CIA 
[554] by Gavin Andresen [75] in summer 2011, Satoshi Nakamoto tended to be very cagey about the 
exposure of Bitcoin to institutional investigation, which might have influenced his resolute exit from 
the Bitcoin project. 
Bobby Fischer 
On 17 January 2008, the extravagant, world-champion (1972-1975) chess genius Bobby Fischer passed 
away [555] in Reykjavik (interestingly, but most likely coincidentally, bitcoin.org [257, 356] is currently 
registered to this capital of Iceland [356]). With a passion for games challenging the prodigy intellect 
in his childhood and teenage years, it may be speculated that Bobby Fischer [555] has been the much-
revered  idol  of  an  underage  superbrain  “Satoshi  Nakamoto”,  possibly  spending  his  spare  time  on 
rehearsing Fischer’s chess strategies from the 1950s to 1970s. 
The young Satoshi would then have intensively studied “The Game of the Century” [556] of 13-year-
old Bobby Fischer in 1956, and his first major titles in 1957 (which corresponds to the year of the last 
citation [557] in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]), and admired his “21-move brilliancy” [558] from 1963.  
Satoshi Nakamoto would certainly also have been aware of the abnormalities and tragedies within 
Bobby Fischer’s active days and post career, including his refusals to defend his lead in tournaments, 
his semi-retirements, forfeiture of title, sudden obscurity, detention, life as an émigré, eventually in 
Iceland. So, if this story holds, how could Satoshi not have been moved by the demise of his childhood 
hero Bobby Fischer in early 2008? 

Bitcoin Whitepaper 
Main Text 
In  his  paper  “Bitcoin:  A  Peer-to-Peer  Electronic  Cash  System”  that  was  released  [559]  to  the 
“Cryptography”  mailing  list  [283]  at  14:10:00  EDT  [233,  280]  on  31  October  2008  [279],  i.e.,  the 
evening of Halloween [560] in GMT [239] (or 01/11/2008 [561] in Japanese time zone [562]), Satoshi 
Nakamoto  outlines  all  key  technical  elements  of  his  invention  in  a  flawless  style  of  writing,  and  a 
logically well-arranged train of thought regarding the content and order of his sectioning; this obser-
vation displays the distinct signature of a genius who can compellingly explain the essential software 
components, and their astute interplay leading to his masterpiece. Nevertheless, Satoshi Nakamoto 
wrote on 14/11/2008 [383] “I'm better with code than with words though” – the author would say his 
talented straddled both terrains. 
Structure 

The document [175] is structured in a common way of scientific publishing, starting with a title, author 
name  (Satoshi  Nakamoto),  email  address  (satoshin@gmx.com),  and  affiliation  (www.bitcoin.org 
[257]), followed by an abstract, introduction, sections 2-11 on the technical ingredients, and winding 
up with conclusions and references; it appears Satoshi Nakamoto had some experience in, or exposure 
to common academic publishing practices, or he at least wanted to convey this impression. 
Writing Style 

Throughout the about 80,000 words making up Satoshi Nakamoto’s text releases in the whitepaper 
and  online  postings,  there  is  only  a  handful  of  minor  typos.  He  rather,  inconsistently,  intersperses 
British [563] / Commonwealth English [564-570] spelling and expressions, like the (mildly) expletive 
“bloody”, into his mainstay American English [571-574]. In the ASCII [575] format postings, he inserts 
a double-space after periods at the end of sentences. Very few typos are found in all his writings, so 
his texts were probably channeled through a spell checker which might have had a default setting, to 
British English, amended private dictionary containing American English terms, or vice versa. 
Terminology 
It  also  strikes  that  Satoshi  Nakamoto  did  not  use  certain  terms;  he  used  the  established  terms 
“electronic cash” [576], or short “e-cash”, which include traditional payments systems like credit cards 
with a magnetic strip for swipe-based readout, but not “cryptocurrency” [577]; Satoshi Nakamoto also 
frequently referred to “blocks” and “chains” in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], but did not introduce the 
phrase “blockchain”. It seems both expressions were coined and disseminated in the community post 
2008. 
Typesetting 

  Additional  metadata 

According to its PDF [286] version of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175, 257, 282] available to the author 
(dated 24 March 2009}, i.e., post its original release on 31 October 2008), the Advanced Metadata’ 
  PDF  Properties’  shows  ‘pdf:Producer: 
(‘Properties 
OpenOffice.org 2.4’), the Bitcoin whitepaper was authored with the ‘Writer’ [578] of the open-source 
office suite OpenOffice.org [579] (version 2.4), its rather primitive graphics probably generated by an 
external programme, and issued as a PDF [286] file (version 1.4). Further information has been tried 
to extract from the metadata [580], without conclusive outcome, e.g., on the original file path.

In 2001, the OpenOffice suite open-sourced as a competitor to other “What you see is what you get“ 
(“WYSIWYG” [581]) kits, like Microsoft Office [582] featuring Microsoft Word [583] clearly prevailing 
the market. Since 2006, OpenOffice chose PDF as the standard printing outlet. 

The metadata of the PDF file further lists (Properties 
(as 

 Fonts) the set of built-in TrueType [584] fonts 
‘Embedded  Subset’):  ArialMT,  CenturySchoolbook-Bold,  CourierNewPSMT,  OpenSymbol,

TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,  TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT,  TimesNewRomanPS;  Arial  was  used  in 
some figures, showing that these figures were not drawn with an external program; the main text 
used the Times New Roman [585] (amusingly in the context of the headline in the genesis block, the 
font commissioned by the British newspaper The Times [304] in 1931), which is also the default font 
of TEX [586] / LATEX [587].  
Hence, speculations circulated that the Bitcoin whitepaper was written in TEX / LATEX, the package 
for document preparation that is popular in academic publishing, particularly in engineering, math, 
natural sciences, computing, and thus also cryptography; however, they could not be substantiated 
[588]. It would have taken a cumbersome, laborious and time-intensive effort of an advanced expert 
for managing to mimic common OpenOffice outputs by TEX / LATEX.  
Given  that  instructions  for  conference  proceedings,  e.g.,  from  the  CRYPTO  series  [589],  warmly 
recommend document preparation by LATEX [590]; hence, a cryptographer using OpenOffice in this 
community  would  have  been  very  rare.  The  most  popular  WYSIWYG  alternative  to  LATEX would 
have been Microsoft Word [583], which had a dominant market share of about 95% in the later 2000s, 
especially on Microsoft Windows (XP) [591] operating system that Satoshi Nakamoto ran around 2008. 
Consequently, given that the usage of OpenOffice does not reflect a carefully arranged smokescreen, 
it represents a rather unique identifier for Satoshi Nakamoto. 

In  any  case,  it  might  be  worthwhile  screening  documents  of  “Satoshi  Nakamoto”  candidates  for 
similar, very unique setups of word processing software, fonts, and other metadata. 
Creation Date 

 Additional metadata 

 XMP Core Properties 
The ‘Advanced Metadata’ (Properties 
[592]) also reveal a creation time of 2009-03-24T11:33:15-06:00 (UTC [238]) [593]. In the United States 
[594], after 2007, daylight saving time (DST) [233] starts on the second Sunday in March, which was 
March  14  in  2009.  Consequently,  the  majority  of  the  federal  states  (or  regions)  in  North  America 
implementing DST would have already had forwarded their clock by one hour on 24 March 2009, and 
UTC-06:00 then corresponds to Mountain Time zones [595] (named after the Rocky Mountains [596]).

In the European Union [597] (back then still including pre-Brexit [598] UK [599]), the switch to DST 
[233] takes place in unison on the last Sunday of the same month since 1981 [600], i.e., on 28 March 
in 2009, so this ‘old-world’ continent was still on standard time at that very date of 2009-03-24 when 
the PDF was produced. 
Note that the main page of the PDF’s ‘Document properties’ specifies ‘Created: 24/03/2009 18:33:15’. 
On the one hand, it uses European date format DD/MM/YYYY; on the other hand, a 7-hour offset to 
UTC-06:00 is observed, corresponding to UTC+01:00 [601], which suggested Central European Time 
(CET) [602] when the PDF was generated. However, these metadata may have been dynamically ad-
justed according to the localization settings of the author’s own computer. 

Just to note that the author could neither verify the authenticity of the PDF version created on 24 
March 2009 examined in this section, nor was he able to retrieve Satoshi Nakamoto’s original PDF 
released on 31 October 2008. The identity of these two files, especially their metadata, thus remains 
unconfirmed. 
Mindset 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  also  distinctively  abstained  from  interweaving  technically  brilliant  parts  of  his 
Bitcoin whitepaper with (personal) ideology, such as the cypherpunk manifesto [165, 166], clear anti-
banking, or anti-government attitudes. Strong statements, or hate speech, are strikingly absent, also 
in  his  later  emails  and  postings,  which  complies  with  sound  practice  and  etiquette  of  scientific 
publishing. Note that  the moderator Perry E. Metzger [603] of the cryptography  mailing  list  [283], 
where the Satoshi Nakamoto published and discussed the Bitcoin whitepaper, intervened as early as 

07 November 2008 to abstain from pitching monetary politics on his forum [604]. Note also that the 
Bitcoin  whitepaper,  which  never  went  through  peer-review,  represents  the  only  publication-like 
document that can unambiguously be attributed to the person known as Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Linguistics 

The writing style of the Bitcoin whitepaper has been analyzed from a linguistic perspective [605, 606]. 
Amongst the candidates proposed at the time, it fits well with Nick Szabo [71], the inventor of Bit Gold 
[71, 262, 607-609]. Yet, the candidate sharply refutes, and also arguments that he was not a proficient 
coder and never implemented a cryptocurrency have been raised against this otherwise compelling 
hypothesis. His denial is further supported by secondary sources and reasoning [272], e.g., his forum 
postings on Bit Gold [262] when Bitcoin was already out in in late December 2008 [610]. 
Versions 
Noticeably, Satoshi Nakamoto seems to have sent out an earlier version of the Bitcoin whitepaper to 
peers [272], which contained a few edits with respect to the later (“final”) version published via the 
cryptography mailing list [175], such as another email address satoshi@vistomail.com, and, most con-
spicuously, a different title “Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party” [267]. Hence, instead of 
“Bitcoin”, Satoshi Nakamoto might have initially used the abbreviation “ecash” (as it appears in the 
filename  [272]),  which  may  indicate  that  he  was  unaware  of  David  Chaum’s  [73,  485,  486,  611] 
synonymous micropayment system [271, 611] that existed in the second half of the 1990s. 
Bibliography 
Somewhat  surprisingly,  the  bibliography  [269,  270,  557,  612-616]  turned  out  to  be  rather  brief, 
selective, incomplete and outdated from a traditional scientific publishing point-of-view. Its compo-
sition looks quite unusual, with only one reference to a publication in a peer-reviewed journal [613], 
four papers from proceedings of US and European conferences in 1980 [616] and the 1990s [612, 614, 
615], two web links [269, 270], and an archaic first edition of a standard textbook [557]. 
Formally, the bibliography numbered (followed by a period, instead of the more common brackets 
“[…]”) according to the order of occurrence in the main text; alternatively, Satoshi Nakamoto might 
have opted for common alphabetical sorting according to the first author’s (last) name. 

To avoid confusion with the numbering of the “regular” citations in this article, the eight citations 
listed in the Bitcoin whitepaper will be designated in the following by round parentheses as (1)…(8). 
The six references (1) [270], (3-5) [613-615], (7) [616], (8) [557] originate from authors affiliated with 
the USA [617], (2) [612] with Belgium [618], and (6) [269] with the UK [599].  
Electronic Cash Systems (1,6) 
The state of-the art is represented by technological precursors [269, 270]; anecdotally, these weblinks 
have  been  added,  post  scriptum,  when  Satoshi  Nakamoto  had  already  completed  the  draft  of  the 
Bitcoin whitepaper and contacted Adam Back [69] on hashcash [269], and then Wei Dai [72, 267] on 
b-money [270] for proper referencing in August 2008.  

It is observed that b-money (1) [72, 270] from 1998 just shows as a text-based webpage elaborating a 
concept without any references to prior work in the field; it has never been implemented. Citation (6) 
[269] on hashcash [69, 269, 619] dated 2002 features 19 references, amongst them two to his prior 
publications on hashcash, and another one to b-money (1) [72, 270]. 
Intriguingly, one citation in (6) [269] refers to a personal communication in March 2002 between two 
cypherpunks [69, 70] who have been frequently mentioned as potential creators of Bitcoin; another 
entry references SYN cookies [620] by Daniel Bernstein [122] (who will play a role later in this article). 
Other than in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], research on digital timestamping (2-5), or other work from 
the founding fathers of blockchain [425, 426], is completely absent in (6). 

Notably, the bibliography of the Bitcoin whitepaper misses out on other important pioneering projects 
leading to electronic cash [73, 271, 485, 621-623], and its presumably closest ancestor Bit Gold [262, 
607, 608], which a member or avid follower of the cypherpunk [165, 166] arena would probably have 
had on his radar at the time of conceiving Bitcoin. It appears that Satoshi Nakamoto only learnt about 
Nick  Szabo’s  [71]  Bit  Gold  [262]  by  Hal  Finney’s  [70]  post  on  the  cryptographer  mailing  list  on  07 
November 2008 [624], i.e., after the release of his Bitcoin whitepaper. 

The  citation  pattern  thus  suggests  that  Satoshi  Nakamoto  may  not  have  only  become  successively 
become  aware  of  prior  work  on  electronic  cash  systems  om  academia,  and  related  activities  the 
cypherpunk [165, 166] community by the time he immersed into developing Bitcoin, so he does not 
seem to have been an integral, seasoned member of this rather radical interest group. 
Benelux Symposium (2) 

Especially the second citation [124, 125, 612] in Bitcoin whitepaper would have surely raised eyebrows 
along the review process submission of a classical journal. On the one hand, it presents comparatively 
preliminary  work  with  respect  to  the  other  references  on  the  1997  project  “TIMESEC”  [625-627] 
sponsored by the federal government of Belgium [618]. Furthermore, according to its “Proceedings of 
the 20th symposium  in  information  theory in the Benelux” [628]issued  by the “Werkgemeenschap 
voor Informatie- en Communicatietheorie (WIC)” [628-630] (as part of the IEEE Benelux chapter on 
information theory [631]), this symposium series primarily attracts local researchers from the Benelux 
[401] region, i.e., the states  of  Belgium  [618], The  Netherlands  [400],  and Luxembourg  [632]; such 
meetings  tend  to  serve  networking  purposes,  with  most  attendees  overwhelmingly  affiliated  with 
local academia. 

Submissions are normally not vigorously peer-reviewed, and important findings are expected to be 
bundled and elaborated to full-fledged journal publications in the follow-up. Unusually, the table of 
contents [628] lists 29 contributions, all attributed to the same senior author, Peter Vanroose [633], 
who  is  also  one  of  the  editors  of  the  proceedings  (while  showing  up  differently  in  the  individual 
papers).  Note  that,  per  its  very  name,  the  focus  of  the  symposium  was  not  specifically  on  crypto-
graphy, and even less on electronic cash or cryptocurrencies. 
Remarkably, citation (2) [612] of the 1999 symposium lists references (3-5) of Bitcoin whitepaper [175] 
(with some miniscule edits). Owing to its very local nature of publication, reference (2) in the Bitcoin 
whitepaper  was  thus  rather  poorly  noticed,  and  hardly  traceable  and  retrievable  by  international 
researchers who were not involved in this comparatively tiny regional meeting. The editor [633] of the 
symposium  proceedings  stated  [634]  that  the  book  of  proceedings  “has  been  registered  at  the 
Koninklijke Bibliotheek Den Haag [635, 636] (The Netherlands) as ISBN 90-71048-14-4.  
As was usual at the time (1999), publication was issued as a printed book, only. The creation date in 
the  metadata  of  the  online  PDF  [286]  version  states  04  June  2020.  All  attendees  [628]  of  the 
symposium  received  a  copy  of  the  proceedings,  which  were  also  sent  to  several  libraries  (e.g., 
University libraries, and the mentioned Koninklijke Bibliotheek [635, 636]).” 

There are 46 contacts in the list of participants, primarily from local academic groups at KU Leuven 
(15) [430], two at UC Louvain [637], and others [433, 638] in Belgium [618], eight at TU Eindhoven 
[431]  and  others  [639-642]  in  the  Netherlands  [400].  Despite  their  contribution  to  several 
contributions, the senior authors of citation (2) [612], J.-J. Quisquater [124], and the head of COSIC 
[643], Bart Preneel [124], were not in attendance. However, Joos Vandewalle [511, 644, 645], a key 
figure at KU Leuven [430] / COSIC [643], and their other researcher like Bart van Rompay [646], Joris 
Claessens [647], and Jorge Nakahara [648-650] from this cryptography epicenter participated. 

Individual, non-regional academics joined from Universities of Essen [651, 652] and Mannheim [653, 
654] in Germany [655], and the IITP [656, 657] in Moscow [658], Russia [659]. There were also two 
researchers from TU Budapest [660] in Hungary [661]), who were visiting KU Leuven [430] at the time, 

but their research area was not cryptography. (Probably entirely coincidentally, a Satoshi Nakamoto 
statue has been unveiled in Budapest in 2021 [662, 663].) Remarkably, seven delegates were seconded 
from industry, exclusively various related departments and subsidiaries at Philips [664-667], six and 
one from their facilities in Eindhoven and Leuven, respectively.  

Attendees most likely deposited hardcopies of the symposium proceedings [628] in the libraries of 
their research groups or universities. Thus, for instance, The British Library [668] lists the proceedings 
as available in their reading rooms, but electronic copies do not appear to have been available online 
for convenient worldwide trackability and download before 2020, or at least prior to the release of 
the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] in 2008. 
Hence, it looks like Satoshi Nakamoto could not have just accidentally “stumbled across” citation (2) 
[612]; either himself, or at least someone close to him, must have personally attended this symposium 
that took place on 27-28 May 1999 in Haasrode [669], Belgium, a location within the strong research 
ecosystem of KU Leuven [430], UC Louvain [637], UCLL [670], COSIC [643] and IMEC [671]. Note that 
Leuven [672] is located in the Flemish Region of Belgium; its French name is Louvain [672]. 

The only alternative explanation of having attended the Benelux meeting is that the same authors 
from the Quisquater [124, 125] group presented a paper [673] with a similar content, and also referen-
cing  (2)  [612],  shortly  after  at  a  meeting  [674]  held  in  June  1999  in  Stanford  [413],  i.e.,  the  San 
Francisco Bay Area [675]. The main difference is that (5) [615] from the Bitcoin whitepaper, which was 
from  an  ACM  conference  in  1997,  is “substituted”  by  a  hard-to-retrieve Cryptobytes  paper  from  a 
meeting that took place in autumn 1995 [676]. 

Also note that while the Bitcoin whitepaper correctly cites (3) [613] with the last page as 111, while 
both, (2) [612] and [673], have it as 112. In addition, (4) [614] which was published at a 1991 confe-
rence, is cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper is referenced as 1993 (the year of publishing), while (2) [612] 
(and [676]) cite it with the year 1992, as quoted in the printed article [614]. These subtle deviations 
suggest that Satoshi Nakamoto must have taken a closer look at the Haber and Stornetta papers (3) 
[613] and (4) [614], and not just copy & pasted them to beef up his stack of references.  
Besides  citation  (2)  [612],  the  table  of  contents  of  the  Benelux  symposium  [628]  exhibits  other 
intriguing papers from the same group led the highly accomplished researchers Joos Vandewalle [511, 
644, 645] and Bart Preneel [365, 494, 505, 508, 677-679] at COSIC [643] / KU Leuven [430]. One is 
entitled  “Anonymity  controlled  electronic  payment  systems”  [680],  which  would  have  an  obvious 
connection to Bitcoin as an electronic payment network. 

Another contribution from the same senior researchers [681] was first authored by “Jorge Nakahara” 
[648-650], which would be a link to the Japanese last name Nakamoto. Note that his given name might 
indicate a relation to the Japanese minority across Latin America [682], e.g., Brazil [683, 684]. Still, the 
list of participants of the 1999 symposium neither recorded Bart Preneel, nor the senior author of (2) 
[612], Jean-Jacques Quisquater [124, 125], in personal attendance [685]. Overall, none of the com-
monly  quoted  big  shots  associated  with  Bitcoin  /  blockchain  /  electronic  cash  in  academia  or  the 
cypherpunk  [165]  scene  were  in  attendance  of  the  1999  symposium,  further  emphasizing  that  its 
global reach was very small. 
In a later section, we investigate whether the exceptionally gifted American cryptographer Leonard 
Harris  (“Len”)  Sassaman  [46,  47,  77,  686],  who  was  a  researcher  at  KU  Leuven’s  [430]  Computer 
Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) [643] group headed by Bart Preneel [505], could have 
gotten  interested  in  cryptocurrencies,  and  been  motivated  to  create  Bitcoin  after  having  read  the 
paper (2) [612] through the hardcopy of the symposium proceedings [628] that was probably available 
in the local library. Suspiciously, the co-supervisors of Sassaman’s PhD project were Bart Preneel [505] 
and  David  Chaum  [73,  486,  687,  688],  who  pioneered  blind  signatures  [485],  and  conceived  the 
anonymous cryptographic electronic money and electronic cash system “ecash” [271] back in 1983. 

Also the renowned cryptographers Hendrik Lenstra [113, 434], his former PhD student, Daniel Bern-
stein [122, 431], and the PGP [689] inventor Phil Zimmermann [74] held positions in, or entertained 
strong links to the Netherlands [400] or Belgium [401]. However, a direct link to the 1999 Benelux 
symposium [628] could not be established. However, even though neither attendant nor author in 
1999, Henk van Tilborg [402, 690], the founder of Ei/Psi [432] who retired from TU Eindhoven [431] in 
2011,  and  is  a  board  member  of  the  organizing  WIC  [630],  and  might  thus  well  had  access  to  the 
proceedings before 2008. 
Benelux Epicenter 

Due to the eminence of the citation (2) [612, 628] in the evolution of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] 
(Figure 1), we first investigate the Benelux [400, 401, 618, 632] environment. In addition to the UC 
Louvain [637] group of senior author Jean-Jacques Quisquater [124, 125], who was a major player in 
the scene at the time, Bart Preneel [505, 677-679] from the neighboring KU Leuven [430] as the head 
or COSIC [643], (still) one of the most prestigious research centers in cryptography on the planet. Both 
groups, as well as their partners and academic descendants, are key stakeholders in IACR [494], e.g., 
serving on their board of directors [508], and as session chairs and speakers. 

Well-renowned cryptography researchers like Joos Vandewalle [511, 644, 645], Frederik Vercauteren 
[691, 692], Yvo G. Desmedt [506, 693], and Joan Daemen [694] were / are affiliated with this Belgian 
cryptography beacon. COSIC members at the time (now mostly alumni) [688] also entertained vivid 
relations with industry, and collaborated with several academic and corporate groups internationally, 
including Japan [490, 650, 688, 695-700]. 

High-caliber cryptography activities  are /  were also conducted with other top  Benelux-based [401] 
institutions, for instance, at TU Eindhoven [122, 402, 431, 432, 690, 701, 702], Leiden University [113, 
434, 703], TU Delft [74, 639], and the University of Amsterdam [704, 705] in the Netherlands [400], 
and  the  Université  Libre  de  Bruxelles  [433,  706]  in  Belgium  [618].  It  is  hard  to  envision  a  Satoshi 
Nakamoto would not even have had, at minimum, secondary links to this world-class cryptography 
landscape, and its academic members, staff, students, partners, or affiliates in the Benelux [401]. 
Blockchain Pioneers (3-5) 

Out of the (only) eight citations in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], three (3-5) are directly from the team 
around the “fathers of blockchain” [425, 426, 613-615], and one (2) [612] is largely based on their 
work  on  timestamping  in  the  early  1990s,  which  is  foundational  for  Bitcoin’s  distributed  ledger 
technology (DLT) [707]. Astonishingly, none of these four references (2-5) appears in (6) on hashcash 
[269, 619]. Note also that Satoshi Nakamoto updated the number of the last page in (3) with respect 
to its (false) representation in (2), revealing again his diligent research approach.  

Remarkably,  the citations (3-5) in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] are listed in their entirety,  with (4) 
slightly deviating, but in a different order, than in (2), which would support a “(2)&(6)-first” hypothesis 
(Figure 1): while certainly a gifted cryptographer and programmer, Satoshi Nakamoto might have only 
become aware of digital timestamping (3-5), as an essential ingredient of blockchain technology, by 
somehow getting his fingers on the Benelux conference paper (2), and prior art on electronic cash 
systems, first through (6) and then (1). 

Figure 1 Evolution of references following the so-called (2)&(6)-first hypothesis, i.e., that Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin initiative 
was principally inspired by two sources: (2) - a paper from a Benelux symposium [673] which, in essence, provided (3-5), and, 
in turn, referenced (7), a foundational 1980-conference paper [616] by Ralph Merkle [419]; and, secondly, (6), a paper on 
“hashcash” [269] by cypherpunk Adam Back [69], which cited (1), an 1998-online article on b-money [270] by Wei Dai [72]. 
Anecdotally, Satoshi Nakamoto approached Adam Back by personal email in August 2008 [266, 708], who guided him to Wei 
Dai’s [267] work. Notably, in (6), Adam Back also listed a personal communication with another cypherpunk Hal Finney [70], 
who became an early adopter of Bitcoin, and Daniel Bernstein [122, 123, 527, 709, 710], a world-class cryptographer and 
freedom-of-speech advocate. The odd one out among the references in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] is (8), the first, 1957-
edition of a standard textbook on probability theory [557, 711] by William "Vilim" Feller [712] who passed away in 1970. Its 
age, i.e., more than half a century in 2008, indicates that the book was purchased by a person who might have been at least 
a college student in his twenties in 1957, i.e., likely pertaining from the parent / uncle or grandparent cohort of relatives of 
a  generation-X  [713]  Satoshi  Nakamoto.  The  vintage  book  or  his  author  probably  had  a  special  meaning  in  Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s  family  to  be  bequeathed  and  used  through  the  family.  Remarkably,  other  relevant  precursors,  such  as  Nick 
Szabo’s [71, 262] Bit Gold from 2005, and David Chaum’s [73] eCash [271] from the later 1990s, are missing. Interestingly, as 
referenced  in  [612],  citation  (2)  seems  to  have  arisen  from  a  collaborative  project  TIMESEC  [625,  626]  between  the 
Quisquater [124, 125] at UC Louvain [637] and the (nearby) Preneel [505, 677, 678] group at KU Leuven [430] in Belgium 
[618, 672]. 

Only then he identified their key shortcomings, such as exhibiting a single point of failure, and con-
ceived the missing element for their solution through decentralization by a distributed public ledger 
[707] file. This rather plausible “(2)&(6)-first” assumption would thus underpin Satoshi Nakamoto’s 
ingenuity, and that his Bitcoin project did not directly emerge from the highly intertwined cypherpunk 
movement [165, 166], possibly even nearly evolved “from scratch” in 2007 (Figure 1). 
Merkle Trees (7) 
Also the seventh citation [616], a contribution to a 1980 symposium held in Sunnyvale (San Francisco 
Bay Area [675], California, USA), would have been rarely included 28 years later by an author in the 
year 2008. This work on so-called “Merkle trees” [714] roots in a patent [715] that was filed in 1979 
and granted in 1982. The technology has presumably been outlined best in a 1987 book chapter [716], 
which may have been the most appropriate reference for the readership of the Bitcoin whitepaper 
[175]. 

The method is named after Ralph Merkle [419], who is one of the inventors of public-key cryptography 
[717],  and  the  architect  of  cryptographic  hashing  [718].  Note  that  the  very  1980-conference  sym-
posium citation (7) [616], which is rather hard to retrieve, was also referenced in (4) [614] and (5) 
[615], where it might have been spotted by Satoshi Nakamoto; this scenario would further support his 
discovery sequence (2)()

(7) according to the “(2)&(6)-first theory (Figure 1).

1957 Edition of Textbook (8) 

The  last  citation  [557]  in  (8)  pops  into  the  eye  as  it  refers  to  a  standard  (2-volume)  textbook  “An 
Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications”; the Bitcoin whitepaper remarkably cites its 
1st edition from 1957. In Satoshi Nakamoto’s (proposed) lifetime, the mid-20th century hardcopy must 
have been mostly available for purchase in antiquarian bookstores. If the content of this book was 
essential in assembling Bitcoin for Satoshi Nakamoto, who supposedly read this source not earlier than 
in  the  1990s,  he  would  have  normally  referenced  its  way more  recent  editions  from  around  1970 
[719], or even a newer, alternative source. In contrast to (3-5) and (7), citation (8) does not appear to 
be retrieved from another reference in the Bitcoin whitepaper. There are a few possible explanations 
for the peculiar choice of a 1957 edition. 

The simplest, and most plausible one points to the libraries of universities that were already founded 
before the second edition was issued in the mid-1960s. The author conducted exemplary searches 
through the catalogues of academic institutions that play a role in the later parts on this article. While 
the  title  is  still  ubiquitously  available  (as  print-only  version),  the  1957  edition  is  (nowadays)  only 
stocked at KU Leuven [77, 430, 436, 505, 645], UC Louvain [124, 637] in Belgium, and UC Berkeley [81, 
122, 412, 720] and Stanford [74, 413, 509, 721] in the Bay Area, as well as MIT [414] and Harvard [421] 
on the East Coast [722], but not at TU Eindhoven [122, 402, 431, 702], UI Chicago [122, 720], UC Santa 
Barbara [73]. However, the libraires that carried to 1957 book also had the newer editions in their 
portfolio, so it would be unusual that someone select the most ancient edition.

↦

Of course, there are usually photocopies 
 email, or even remote hardcopy loans 
 post, digital scans 
offered by such libraries; but it would be extremely unusual that a client would remotely request an 
outdated  copy  of  a  book  if  a  newer  edition  that  was  locally  available.  Also,  these  services  would 
normally only (manually) copy a few pages, but not an entire book. Overall, this likely scenario would 
mean Satoshi Nakamoto was, as a (postgraduate) student or academic (around 2007/2008), immersed 
in a university setting where he just went into the nearby library to collect (8) [557]. 
Less likely, the historic, 1957 standard textbook (8) [557] on probability theory might have been part 
of  a  personal  collection,  e.g.,  handed  as  an  heirloom  through  generations;  so  close,  elder  family 
members, like his parents and grand- or godparents, uncles or aunts, might have had studied, or been 
professionally involved in mathematics, to make (8) precious enough not to be discarded over several 
decades. Reference (8) might hence be attributed to a special relation, or gesture of respect of Satoshi 
Nakamoto himself (or his mentors) to the book author; William “Vilim” Feller [712] (1906-1970), a 
Croatian-born  professor  who  eventually  retired  from  Princeton  [723],  is  widely  remembered  for 
pioneering probability theory [711] as a branch of mathematical analysis. 
This peculiar age of citation (8), more than half a century in 2008, might also hint to the significance 
of the year 1957 [724], maybe referring to the beginning of the space age with the Soviet Sputnik [725] 
satellite, the start of the S&P 500 stock market index [726], or IBM releasing the first Fortran [727] 
compiler; or was the choice of the 1957 edition of the book (8) just a (hard to spot) hint to Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s year of “birth” 1975 by swapping of the last two digits to 
Dated References 
Overall, except  for two  citations  (1)  and (6) on digital currency  projects [269, 270, 619] that were, 
reportedly, added, post scriptum, to the draft of the whitepaper in late summer 2008, most references 
precede the Bitcoin whitepaper by more than 10 years, and literally none of them is younger than 6 
years; their average year of publication is situated before 1990, i.e., about 18 years prior to the release 
of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175].

? 

Such a short and antique mix of citations, and its diverse caliber, are unquestionably conspicuous, thus 
indicating that Satoshi Nakamoto tried to mimic scientific publishing, but did not possess an extended 

track record of active authoring in this arena; alternatively, he was simply not paying much attention 
to academic etiquette, and just dropped a brief, “quick-and-dirty” list; this impression resembles the 
footprint of a junior-level stint in academia, for instance, as a gifted postgraduate [728] or postdoctoral 
researcher [729]. 

Alternatively, Satoshi Nakamoto could have also opted to omit references. It is therefore more likely 
that the mastermind of Bitcoin came out of a relevant public agency or corporate background, where 
he routinely studied techno-scientific papers from the academic space, but had seldomly spearheaded 
authorship  of  publications  in  top-quartile  journals.  In  addition,  it  can  also  be  firmly  assumed  that 
Satoshi Nakamoto avoided self-citations (under his real name), as this would have quickly jolted him 
on the list of suspects for having created Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin Dates 
Satoshi Nakamoto could evidently not have rewritten factual history, so we should also consider the 
wider context of the constituents of his self-fabricated date of birth. 
Bitcoin Whitepaper on 31 October 2008 
Day 

 and 

The day Satoshi Nakamoto chose for the release the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] in 2008 was 31 October 
[279], i.e., Halloween [560] in many Western countries. This may indicate awareness of this ancient 
tradition, or superstition. Yet, depending on the time zone, the publication date is sometimes falls on, 
01/11/2008 [561] (a Christian holiday [730]), which is only composed of the binary numbers 
– the number set of digital math. While this might be coincidental, the 1st of November was a Saturday, 
1
which  resonated  with  “Satoshi”;  both  theories  hint  towards  a  work  schedule  peaking  towards  the 
weekend. 
Course of Year 2008 
In January 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto’s potential chess hero Bobby Fischer [555], who was famous for 
his “21-move brilliancy” [558], passed away, the movie “21” [731] and the Mystery-Jets [732] album 
“Twenty-One” [733, 734] were released in March, and the song “42” [735, 736] by Coldplay [737] in 
June. The global financial crisis [520, 738] had its first doomsday with the collapse of Lehman Brothers 
[524], one of the largest US investment banks [525], on the 15th of September [526] that same year, 
i.e., just a few weeks prior to the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. 
Genesis Block 0 on 03 January 2009 
The Times 
Headline 

0

These  dramatic  happenings  of  the  along  the  unfolding  global  financial  crisis  [520,  738]  must  have 
certainly  been  on  the  radar  of  Satoshi  Nakamoto,  as  impressively  recorded  by  the  message  he 
engraved into the genesis block 0 [177, 302] of the Bitcoin blockchain [177]; issued on Saturday, 03 
January 2009 [739], he included the (exact) headline of the London-based British daily newspaper “The 
Times” (of London) [303, 304]: “Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks” [176] of that very 
day. The inclusion of newspaper content remarkably resembles the timestamping methods [425, 426, 
612-615] developed in the 1990s, which are extensively referenced (2-5) in the Bitcoin whitepaper 
[175]. 
Editions 

Note  that  the  exact  wording  of  the  headline  referenced  in  the  genesis  block  0  [176,  177,  302] 
exclusively showed on the front page of the UK print version of “The Times” [303, 304], of which nearly 
half of its readers are  based  in London;  crucially for this investigation, the corresponding article in 

 
globally accessible online edition [740] was titled “Chancellor Alistair Darling on brink of second bail-
out for banks” [741-746]. Since its start in 1996 up to July 2010, i.e., before the minding of the genesis 
block, the website operated without a paywall [740]. 
In the international (print-only at the time) edition of “The Times”, in the (inner) section (on page 21) 
[747]  titled  “Britain”,  the  corresponding  punchline  also,  even  only  subtly,  but  decisively  for  the 
purpose of this study, deviated (in its ending) from the quote in Bitcoin’s genesis block: “Chancellor 
on brink of second bank bailout to boost lending” [747]. 
Since 2006, “The Times” [303, 304] has been issuing a designated US (print-only version) [748], which 
is primarily disseminated in the capitol area of Washington D.C. [749], and New York City [750]. This 
US edition is / was based on the international edition; it also did not display the headline cited in the 
Bitcoin genesis block [751] on its front page at all; the “bailout” story was identical to the international 
version  [752],  and  buried  on  an  inner  page,  i.e.,  invisible  when  briefly  glancing  the  papers,  while 
passing a newsstand. 

“The  Times”  is  ranking  high  among  the  English-language  newspapers  preferred  by  rather  well-
educated and internationally minded readers, chiefly in the UK [599] and the Commonwealth [565], 
and outside North America. This correlation obviously indicates Satoshi Nakamoto’s keen interest in 
the current affairs in Britain, which would be very uncommon for a non-British “techie” residing in 
countries outside the UK and Commonwealth [565].  

As, most likely, a digital native, it is surprising that Satoshi Nakamoto resorted to the UK print version. 
Since the headline was included in the genesis block [176, 177, 753], the print version must have been 
available to Satoshi Nakamoto on the same Saturday, 03 January 2009 [739], meaning that he must 
have  been  located  in  the  UK,  or  have  had  purchased,  or  walked  past  one  of  the  few  newsagents 
abroad, e.g., at international traffic hubs like airports, railway or bus stations, which would stock the 
latest UK issue of “The Times”. 
The latest print edition of this prestigious newspaper was most probably also well available in and 
around Brussels [706], the headquarter of the European Union [597], especially in pre-Brexit [598] 
2009 when British affairs where highly relevant for both, UK and EU politicians, commissioners, offers, 
and bureaucrats were in the capital of Belgium [643]. Note that the cryptographer epicenter Leuven / 
Louvain [430, 637, 643, 670, 672], e.g., the team around the second citation (2), is only 30 km away 
from Brussels [706], so some of their researchers might even live there. For timely quotation in the 
genesis block, Satoshi Nakamoto was unlikely to be travelling, but rather keeping his computer stably 
connected  to  the  internet  in  a  fixed  place  for  assuring  continuous  running  and  monitoring  the 
embryonic Bitcoin blockchain. 
Of course, also a colleague or friend based in the UK might have taken a screenshot and sent it to 
Satoshi Nakamoto, for instance, as he would have known about his interest in the bailout; yet, this 
came at the risk of another person being able to unmask his identity. 

Therefore,  in  addition  to  a  timestamp,  in  a  sense  that  the  genesis  block  cannot  have  been  mined 
before 03 January 2009,  the  citation  of the (literal) headline also provides a “geostamp” to places 
where the UK print version was available sufficiently early to be embossed in the genesis block. Not, 
however, that since Satoshi Nakamoto was the only person running a node / the nodes, he could of 
course have forged the timestamp, e.g., to just before block 1. 
Time of the Day 

Block 0 [302] was mined at 6:15 pm GMT [239], probably derived the time of the date, time of the 
day, and time zone [231] setting on his own computer (which he could have manipulated). This timing 
fits to Satoshi Nakamoto’s main posting hours [754] starting around 3 pm GMT, as further discussed 
later in this article. Such schedule may have allowed that Satoshi Nakamoto had gotten up on that 

very Saturday at some hour in the morning, saw or picked up a copy of “The Times” displayed at a 
local store while passing by on a walk, noticed the daunting headline, returned home, rushed to give 
the  code  some  final  touches,  and  then,  in  hindsight,  possibly  prematurely  kicked  off  the  Bitcoin 
blockchain in the late afternoon of the same day. 

The launch of the blockchain occurred around midday in continental American time zones [280, 595, 
755, 756]. However, newsagents only carried the printed US issue of “The Times” featuring the proper 
headline in on the US-East Coast [722]. So the genesis block would have been mined at 1:15 pm ET 
[280], thus leaving a rather short interval for Satoshi Nakamoto between picking up a printed “The 
Times” from an East-Coast international newsagent and initiating the Bitcoin blockchain. However, I 
this  putative  scenario,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  would  have  not  known,  and  thus  been  able  to  quote, 
verbatim, the exact headline of the UK print issue. 

This genesis-block timestamp corresponds to very early Sunday morning [757] in the Far East [758], 
e.g.,  about  3  am  in  Japan  [454,  757].  Factoring  in  non-uniform  DST  [233]  during  summer  on  the 
Southern  Hemisphere  [235]  in  Australia,  while  Britain  is  on  GMT  [239]  in  January,  6:15  pm  GMT 
spreads into the period of 2 am to 5 am in Australia [457, 759]. However, it would be unlikely that 
Satoshi Nakamoto got hold of a hardcopy of “The Times” during the late Saturday in these countries 
that are far ahead of GMT [239], and then started Bitcoin shortly after 3 am JST [562] in, for instance, 
Tokyo [562, 760], or 4 am in Brisbane [761] located in AEST [759]. 

This hybrid, analog-digital timestamp analysis makes it very likely that Satoshi Nakamoto resided in 
the UK, or a metropolitan area in Europe, on Saturday, 03 January 2009 [739]. As the, at the time, sole 
lifeline  of  Bitcoin,  he  would  probably  not  have  operated  his  freshly  initiated  blockchain  from  an 
intermittently connected computer, so he may have settled at the same place for a longer period of 
time. 
Historical Context 

On this very day in January 2009 [739], which was a Saturday, also Sir Alan Arthur Walters [762], a 
prominent British economist, passed away. He was best known as the Chief Economic Adviser to the 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher [763], and fought for Britain to maintain strict monetary targets, 
and that the money supply should not be manipulated for political reasons. These attitudes of rigorous 
fiscal  policies  might  have  appealed  to  Satoshi  Nakamoto.  However,  given  that  his  Alan  Walter’s 
activities in his political role dated as far back as the 1980s, it is less likely that this gentleman was on 
Satoshi Nakamoto’s agenda. 
Block 1 on 09 January 2009 
Technical Reason 

Upon seeing these events, Satoshi Nakamoto might have expedited issuing the genesis block [177, 
302], but it then took him more time to mine block 1 [305] after a six-day gap on Friday, 09/01/2009 
[764]  at  2:54  am  GMT.  Experts  believe  that  the  remarkable  mining  hiatus  may  have  simply  been 
caused by the instability of the frequently crashing Bitcoin v0.1 code. Again, the lack of independent 
nodes  on  the  P2P  network  of  neonate  Bitcoin made  timestamping  prone  to  manipulation,  e.g.,  to 
retrofit the headline in “The Times” on 03 January 2009. 
Symbolism 
The historical events on this day do not seem to have particular significance to Bitcoin, except that its 
cross sum 
 yields 21, a figure which assumes a central role in Bitcoin, 
most strikingly in the strictly limited total supply of BTC.  
Origin Myth 
This way, in addition to obfuscating his own identity, Satoshi Nakamoto might have wanted to enhance 
Bitcoin’s origin myth [765]. As for many world religions, their founders [766-769] were typically not 

0 + 9 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 9

particularly keen on depositing formal data of their lives; in absence, or extreme paucity of primary 
sources,  historians  can  often  not  even  agree  on  much  more  than  that  they  lived  within  a  loosely 
defined time span in a certain region. While it is highly doubtful whether Satoshi Nakamoto wanted 
to plant a reference to such religious context, he, at least intuitively, knew well about the power of an 
origin myth preserved by his pseudonymity (in addition to protecting his privacy, and to deflecting 
potential legal issues [496]). 

In a rather fancy, entirely speculative, but hopefully enjoyable theory (which is not at all meant to hurt 
religious feelings of any kind), Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to fog Bitcoin with an ex nihilo [770] (“out of 
nothing”) type of founding narrative; for this, in the context of major monotheistic [142], Abrahamic 
religions [771] believing in a single deity [772] (“Satoshi Nakamoto”), the mining gap ought to evoke 
the six-days of creation of the world [773] in the Book of Genesis (1:3–2:3) [774], which constitutes 
the  first  book  of  the  Hebrew  Bible  [775]  and  the  Christian  Old  Testament  [776].  Continuing  the 
alignment with biblical happenings, his later departure might refer to The Exodus [777] or Ascension 
[347], and prophets [778] will spread divine messages. 

In  Christianity  [779],  Jesus  sacrificed  himself  (“burning  Satoshi’s  BTC”)  [780],  so  humanity  was  no 
longer  bound  in  sin  (“dysfunctional  banking  system”).  There  are  equivalents  to  the  disciples  [781] 
(“early Bitcoin contributors” [70, 296, 353]), the (12) apostles / (“early messengers of Bitcoin story”) 
[29, 69, 782], Saint Peter (“Petrus”) [783] (aka “Gavin Andresen” [75]), the first pope [784] appointed 
by Jesus (“Satoshi Nakamoto”), the (4) evangelists [785] (“promotional story writers”), and present-
day missionaries [387, 786-793]. 
On the other hand, and the exegetes [794] critically analyzing story of Bitcoin, and impactful heretics 
[795, 796] [797, 798], derogatively termed “gerontrocacy” [799] by the believers, who emphatically 
deny the economic value of Bitcoin. First-century Christians (“present-day Bitcoiners”) believed Jesus 
would have a Second Coming [350] during their lifetime [800]. On doomsday [801, 802], only faithful 
Bitcoin “hodlers” [803] will pass the final judgement and ascend to heaven (“wealth”). 
Of course, the concrete biblical dimension in the story above may, most likely, be a fictional product 
exclusive to the author’s overactive imagination; however, from the striking parallels, it may still be 
inferred that Satoshi Nakamoto wanted  to plant a founding  myth [348] into Bitcoin, resorting to a 
similar plot, and ingredients that critically contributed to the success of various religions and dynasties. 

In the aftermath of the origin, a religion tends to split [804-806] into different churches, schools, bran-
ches, denominations, and faiths [807]. This pattern resembles the path of Bitcoin’s hardforks [808], 
and the emergence of new religions (“next-generation cryptocurrencies”), which still benefit, to some 
extent, from the origin myth and technological backbone (“blockchain”) of their common ancestor.  
There is a range of evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of the supreme authority endowed by 
a foundational legend, and deliberately deployed it for bolstering Bitcoin, and assure its sustainability. 
So  the  allegoric  [208]  saga  presented  here,  even  if  not  scoped  in  this  (specific)  way,  hopefully 
illustrates the abstract design, purpose, and power of a founding myth; Bitcoiners and neutral analysis 
as well as crypto-sceptics (“nocoiners”) can thus understand the major driver for Satoshi Nakamoto’s 
[214]  pseudonymity,  his  inconspicuous  departure,  his  ongoing  silence,  his  reasoning  /  self-
commitment to abstain from cashing out, and then draw their qualified conclusions for the future. 

Personality & Bio 
Pseudonym 
The inventor of Bitcoin was evidently free to mint his online name, which is broadly acknowledged to 
represent an alias; otherwise, the tremendous accompanying measures to mask his identity would not 
have made any sense at all. 

Name 

His given (male) name “Satoshi” [809], as well as his last name “Nakamoto” [810], are quite common, 
predominantly in Japan, and its emigrant subcultures abroad; (rather debatable) connection of this 
pseudonym have been fielded by Craig Wright [96, 811] to underpin his claimed inventorship of Bit-
coin: Wright claimed [812, 813] that the first name is connected to in a semi-fictional book “The House 
of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance” [814] published in 1990. 
In  the  story  “Satoshi  Sugiyama”,  was  adopted  by  an  American,  and  given  the  name  David  Phillips, 
possibly  alluding  to  his  junior  partner  Dave  Kleiman  [117];  the  last  name  is  declared  to  refer  to  a 
historical figure, “Tominaga Nakamoto”. However, these connections seem to be too far-fetched to 
be noticeable for any reader, even with some effort. To the author’s best knowledge, the pseudonym 
is  thus  not  inspired  by  a  renowned  historic  figure  or  fictional  character  in  the  Japanese  or  global 
culture. 

Satoshi Nakamoto selected a rather generic name and nationality having a vivid cryptographer scene, 
rather than just a fantasy, gender- and stateless internet handle; this specific choice might indicate his 
intent to tailor a message through this artificial character. Note that in the Japanese and other Asian 
cultures, the order of the two names is reversed, i.e., he would be called Nakamoto Satoshi, and his 
initials would read as “NS”. These first letters were part of a Bitcoin address [815] generated by Satoshi 
Nakamoto, which he highlighted in an email to Hal Finney [70] on 12/01/2009 [299] for its potential 
name matching. “NS” would evidently also go with Nick Szabo [71], the author of Bit Gold [608], as 
discussed later in this article. 
Group? 

The singular of the pseudonym suggests an individual, not a team; the immense effort to coordinate 
and eternally protect a cover among multiple conspirators also suggests the hypothesis of a single 
actor. Yet, it has been purported [816] that an agent from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
[817,  818]  interviewed  Satoshi  Nakamoto  in  the  context  of  Bitcoin  and  illicit  online  markets,  and 
reportedly met a group of four men in California [493]. 
The credibility of this second source cannot be verified, and also the names of the group members 
have  not  been  revealed  in  this  feed.  Some  speculation  spawned  around  the  Bay-Area  [675]  based 
team  around  Jed McCaleb  [130, 819, 820], David  Schwartz  [132],  Arthur  Britto  [821],  Ryan  Fugger 
[134], Brad Garlinghouse [822], and Chris Larsen [131] involved in setting up what later became as the 
payment protocol / cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) [133, 138, 823-828]. 
If Satoshi Nakamoto was indeed a moniker for a group, the durability of their bullet-proof collusion 
pact  must  have  been  fortified  by  a  vigorously  sanctioned  agreement  or  self-commitment,  e.g.,  to 
protect against the threat of prosecution by a federal agency, or to shield significant financial interests. 
Thus, for the sake of this paper, we continue considering Satoshi Nakamoto a single male (he/his), 
even though  it could  also be  part of  a “red  herring” [829] strategy to  mislead about  gender, or to 
conceal a party of contributors. Notably, to the author’s best knowledge, all candidates pitched as 
Satoshi Nakamoto (so far) are men. 
Translation & Interpretation 
The  pseudonym  also  leaves  room  an  interesting  aspect.  There  is  some  significant  scope  for  its 
translation  from  Japanese  into  English;  “Satoshi”  may  be  translated  as  intelligent  history  [830], 
knowledge, or  wisdom [831, 832]. The  initial syllable “Naka–” of his last name can be  rendered as 
“being within”, “between or in the middle of something” [833]. The final part “-moto” constitutes a 
common terminus of Japanese family names; “Nakamoto“ may stand for "the origin, the cause, the 
foundation, the basis" [834]. There is some, probably random, similarity to the Japanese computer 
scientists Satoshi Obana [835], who published at CRYPTO 2001 [836], and co-authored with Shizuo 

Sakamoto [837]. As a faint hint, reversal (and minor deletion / insertion) yields “Ottomakan”, possible 
hinting to the historic Ottoman Empire [838] (1299-1922), and thereby a connection to modern Turkey 
(Republic of Türkiye) [82, 839].  

Intelligence 
In absence of reference  to  a  known  figure, and in the  context of Bitcoin and ideological  spirit, the 
chosen pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto might thus reflect a self-description, which may be construed 
as “a genius  who  is  highly  focused  on  work to disrupt the foundations (of the established banking 
system)”. The entire stage name may also be creatively understood as “central intelligence”.  

Moreover, it is worth pointing out that in Chinese, Satoshi Nakamoto may be read as “the wise one of 
Chinese currency” [840, 841]. It is indeed reported that three-letter agencies like the CIA [554], DIA 
[461], NSA [460], or other entities pertaining to the United States Intelligence Community [842], the 
FBI [544], or their international equivalents [438, 843-850] and hybrids [851, 852], have, by the secre-
tive nature of their own service, the vital importance to military communication [853], or by eaves-
dropping  on  their  targets,  a  keen  interest  in  cryptography  [250],  and  are  (nowadays)  likely  to  be 
specifically involved, via various modes, in cryptocurrencies [854]. 

However,  it  is  widely  believed  to  be  unlikely  that  such  governmental  institutions  have  directly 
instigated Bitcoin [855], at least not as part of their remit as a public agency. Nevertheless, their former 
or present (renegade) staff, or their external service providers, might have gained sufficient know-
ledge  of  technologies  and  methods  to  pull  off  Bitcoin  in  a  self-driven  after-work  or  post-contract 
initiative. This hypothesis was also advocated by insiders the author communicated with under the 
condition of their anonymity. 

Overall, given these semantics and their fit to a personality required to realize Bitcoin, the choice of 
the stage name Satoshi Nakamoto does not seem to be pure coincidence; in fact, it made the author 
curious about further revelations that he might have encoded. Just to mention that the Bitcoin and 
cryptocurrency advocate Elon Musk [15], presumably as a good joke he adopted from a 2013 forum 
post [856], considered Satoshi Nakamoto as an acronym for large Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and US-
owned  companies  /  conglomerates  SAmsung  [857],  TOSHIba  [858],  NAKAm[in]ichi  [859],  and 
MOTOrola [860] – as a highly gifted individual, Musk certainly enjoys spotting contextual patterns. 
Date of Birth 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  populated  a  profile  on  his  personal  page  at  the  P2P  Foundation  [861,  862], 
intriguingly in 2012, i.e., after he disappeared under his online alias. Apart from claiming his Japanese 
nationality  or  residency,  he  provided  05  April  1975  [863]  as  his  date  of  birth.  The  real  Satoshi 
Nakamoto is unlikely to be born on this very day, as this would resemble publishing most digits of his 
passport number. The reason is that there are 365 options for the day of the year, and – say – 100 
cryptographers globally who could possibly have developed Bitcoin. So given that dates of birth are 
rather overt biodata which commonly reside in several unsafe online databases, especially considering 
that federal agencies possess a backdoor to public administration, it would most likely lead to only 
one match per year of birth. 
Furthermore,  as  Satoshi  Nakamoto  most  likely  wanted  to  convey  a  message  through  his  alias,  he 
probably also opted to put a meaning into his day of birth. It is observed that the cross sum 

  of  the  birth  date  in  its  short format DD/MM/YY  [230] result  in 21,  the most 
0 + 5 +
ubiquitous number in Bitcoin (see date of birth above, and in the following). Other than the arrival of 
+0 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 21
the  creator  of  Bitcoin  on  the  planet,  there  are  not  many  associated  happenings  that  caught  the 
attention of the global news on that very day [863], except that it was a Saturday in 1975, possible 
referring to his chosen given name.  

Still, there was a sequence of potentially relevant events in the two days prior to Satoshi Nakamoto’s 
birthday [864] (see also Appendix). 
Preceding Days 
On  03  April  1975,  the  chess  genius  Bobby  Fischer  [555]  very  unexpectedly  declined  to  resume 
competing for the World-Chess title [865] against Anatoly Karpov [866] in Manila [867] (Philippines 
[868]), thereby turning down a chance to clench a premium of more than USD 1.5 million. He thus 
became the first world chess champion [869] to willingly forfeit this most prestigious trophy. Bobby 
Fischer’s rather odd behavior shows amazing parallels to Satoshi Nakamoto’s sudden withdrawal in 
2010/2011, and his ongoing abstinence from reaping the future of his 1-million BTC fortune. 

On  04  April  1975,  Bill  Gates  [13] and Paul  Allen  [870] founded “Micro-Soft“  [871],  a  sea-change 
moment for the modern age of information. Notably, Satoshi Nakamoto used Microsoft’s Windows 
(XP) [591] operating system (but OpenOffice.org [579], instead of Microsoft Word [583], as text editor 
for typesetting the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], see above). 
Age 
This  self-claimed  birthday  features  two  constituents.  The  year  1975  tethers  him  to  the  so-called 
Generation X [713], and infers a “credible”, not too young or old age of 33 years around the time he 
was issuing the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] and the genesis block [177] in later 2008 and early 2009, 
respectively. A lot of great inventors were at the prime of their creativity in the 30-55 age envelope 
[872], and that at this stage in life people tend to have garnered sufficient personal life experiences 
and professional competences to form strong opinions, and to execute on effective solutions. 
Like Satoshi Nakamoto, also the English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee (“TimBL”) [212] was 33 
years old when he proposed an information management system in 1989 via the Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol  (HTTP)  [873].  His  invention  seeded  the  World  Wide  Web  (“WWW”,  “Web1.0”)  [213],  the 
technology boosted the “information age” [874], and has most drastically changed lives of people, 
societies and economies forever, which might have been on Satoshi Nakamoto’s agenda with Bitcoin 
heralding the “Internet of Value” [875]. 
Satoshi Nakamoto could have certainly shifted the (final one or two digits of) the year he claimed to 
have been born, so maybe somewhere between  the mid-1950s and  about  1990, but  probably not 
much farther. Combining his assumed age and his gradual, seemingly long-haul choreographed exodus 
from the Bitcoin community, it is unlikely that Satoshi Nakamoto was mentally incapacitated, or has 
deceased in 2011. 
Year 
The year 1975 [876] was marked by a few potentially related events (see also Appendix), such as the 
Watergate scandal [877], [877], which featured the abuse of government agencies the FBI [544], the 
CIA [554], and the IRS [878] as political weapons, and the end phase of the Vietnam war [879], both 
shattering the US government [880] in Washington DC [749]. Some less likely connections were that 
the Rockefeller Commission issued its report on CIA abuses [881], the signing of the Helsinki Accords 
[882], which officially recognize Europe's national borders and respect for human rights, the approval 
of the bailout of 6.9 billion total USD for New York City [876], and the coining of the term “fractal” 
[883]  by  the  Polish-born  French-American  mathematician  and  polymath  [884]  Benoit  Mandelbrot 
[885]. 

Also in 1975, the so-called Monty-Hall problem [886] was solved biostatistician Steve Selvin [887] from 
the University of California, Berkeley [412] (which will play a role in a subsequent section). Finally, the 
7  results  from  swapping  the  last  two  digits  on  the  publication  date  of  the  final 
number 1957195
citation (8) [557] in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175].

Day of the Month 

The situation  is much  different  for  the  particular day in the past  [888]. Blaise de Vigenère [889], a 
French cryptographer, diplomat, translator and alchemist was born on April 05 in 1523. Kurt Cobain 
[890], the enigmatic, anti-establishment artist, singer and angst-fueled songwriter of the American 
grunge rock band Nirvana [891] from the Seattle music scene [892], an iconic figurehead of Gene-
ration-X [713], committed suicide on 05 April 1994. 

Most  conspicuously  for  Bitcoin,  during  the  Great  Depression  [33,  893]  on  April  05  in  1933,  US-
President Franklin D. Roosevelt [894] signed the Executive Order 6102 [895, 896], which made it illegal 
for American citizens to privately own gold; this ban was not lifted for more than 40 years later by US-
President  Gerald  Ford  [897],  effective  on  31  December  1974.  By virtue of  his  (surmised)  ideology, 
Satoshi Nakamoto certainly had a keen interest in the evolution and practices around money [898] / 
currencies [899], and was concerned how individuals could preserve their personal wealth, and, as an 
avowed libertarian [378], keep it safe from state intervention [900]. His deliberate choice of April 05 
is likely to be related to this event. 
Sakura 
In Japanese, a cherry blossom, also known as Japanese cherry, translates to “Sakura” [901]. Bloom 
typically occurs between March and April in the Northern Hemisphere; the exact date depends on 
factors like the species, climate, weather and geographical location, but a date around April 05 is not 
uncommon. In Japanese Shinto-influenced mythology [902], cherry blossoms symbolize clouds due to 
their nature of blooming en masse, besides being an enduring metaphor for the ephemeral [903], or 
transitory nature of life. Satoshi Nakamoto might have reinforced his (adopted) attachment to the 
Japanese culture through his date of birth. 
First Contact Day 

In the Star Trek sequel [904], the first interactions between humans and Vulcans “took” place on 05 
April 2063 [905]. Sci-fi aficionados celebrate this “historic” event on this day of the year [906]. So is 
Satoshi Nakamoto a “Trekkie” [907]? 
Nationality & Country of Residence 
The  choice  of  his  pseudonym  would  initially  propose  a  Japanese  person.  People  from  other  Asian 
backgrounds, like Koreans or Chinese, owing to certain historic events, some deeply rooted animo-
sities, and clashes of culture, are less likely to voluntarily adopt a Japanese nationality. 
Britain and the Commonwealth 
Actually, there is a train of evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto possesses a Western, presumably a British 
/ Commonwealth or North-American nationality, or at least spent a good part of his formative years 
in these cultural habitats. 

In fact, virtually all (so far) seriously considered nominees originate from such countries where all or 
most people master the English language with native-level fluency, and might be more aware of the 
British culture and current affairs than other nationals. Registering “The Times” [303, 304] headline in 
the genesis block [176, 177, 302, 753] hints towards his state of mind and objective for Bitcoin, and 
possibly towards his cultural embedding within the realm of the United Kingdom of Great Britain [599], 
or the Commonwealth [565]. The expression “Chancellor” (of the Exchequer) [908], would be very 
uncommon in the USA, where the role is referred to as the “Secretary of the Treasury” [909]. 

This very pattern certainly matches Satoshi Nakamoto’s flawless mastering of the English language 
with a peculiar mélange of British [563] and American [571] (and possible Canadian [910]) spelling and 
idioms,  e.g.,  expressions  like  the  expletive  "bloody  (hard)"  [572-574],  terms  such  as  "flat"  (Am.: 
apartment), “mobile” (Am.: cell phone), “defence” (Am.: defense), and "maths" (Am.: math), and the 
spellings "grey"  and  "colour") in the  Bitcoin whitepaper  [175], code  base  [911], and  related online 

communication [912], and preference for the European date format [230] DD/MM/YYYY [913], and 
reference to the Euro currency [353], all very uncommon for US-natives. 

This ostentatious blend might be characteristic of an excellent non-native speaker, as typical for, e.g., 
Dutch [914] / Flemish (dialect) [915] speakers from the Benelux [401], or Scandinavians [916], who are 
widely exposed to a mixture of British and US language variants through un-dubbed, original-language 
broadcasts, such as movies and TV series, in their mainstream media. These nationals are often in-
distinguishable from native-speakers in writing, with some accent in speaking, and possibly flipping 
between American and British English. Alternatively, a native American English [571] speaker living for 
some formative period might have partially assimilated to a British English [563] influenced environ-
ment, e.g., as a postgraduate student or visiting scholar in Europe, or vice versa. 
Daily Schedule 

Yet, systematic timestamp and metadata analysis of his numerous online postings [66, 172, 364, 917] 
indicate that Satoshi Nakamoto did not post between the hours of 5 am and 11 am Greenwich Mean 
Time (GMT) [239] in the UK, which would translate to 2 pm and 8 pm Japanese Standard Time (JST) 
[562], making it unlikely that he resided in Japan, or another Far-East (Asian) [758] location, assuming 
rather normal (say midnight to 6 am) sleeping schedules (which is not necessarily applicable to coders 
and hackers having daytime college lectures, social activities, or jobs to pay their way). 
IP Address 
In the very early days of Bitcoin, IP addresses [174] were used in transferring BTC. On 10 January 2009, 
a systematic analysis of the two IP addresses [59, 918-921] (arguably [922]) of a debug log [923] sug-
gested that Satoshi Nakamoto was located in the Van Nuys  [924] neighborhood  in the central San 
Fernando Valley [925] region of Los Angeles [926], California [493]. 
Multi-Location 
Therefore, Satoshi Nakamoto was not residing in Japan, but moving across US (Eastern to Pacific) [172, 
280, 595, 755, 756] or British (most likely: London [742, 743]) time zones [231] during his post-2008 
interactions with the online fora. Alternatively, the messages might have originated from a geogra-
phically spread company of authors, each of them potentially with their own writing style and spelling 
patterns. 
Clock Settings 
Satoshi Nakamoto also appears to have (deliberately?) changed his onboard computer clock between 
different American and British / GMT / Far-East time zones, implying frequent intercontinental travel, 
or deliberate manipulation. We have already concluded from PDF metadata that that the author of 
the Bitcoin whitepaper was in Mountain Time zone in mid-March 2009. 
A post by Satoshi Nakamoto dated ‘February 15, 2010, 06:28:38 AM’ (UTC [238]) refers to an event 
that took place on 14th of February (presumably in his own time zone) as “yesterday” [927]. This means 
that, on that day [928], Satoshi Nakamoto could have not been farther West than UTC-06:00 [929], 
corresponding to (standard) Central Time (CT/CST) [756], e.g., the state of Illinois [720, 930]. 

In addition, some inconsistencies in sent and receive times in personal emails Satoshi Nakamoto ex-
changed with Hal Finney regarding early code development in January 2009 were pointed out [293]. 
Connectivity 
At 8:41 am (UTC [238]/ GMT? [239]) on Monday, 12/01/2009 [318],  Satoshi Nakamoto mentioned 
“Unfortunately,  I  can't  receive  incoming  connections  from  where  I  am”  [299],  directing  to  travel, 
(remote) rural areas, or government-restricted blockage of select internet services. 

Links to Japan 
Manga / Anime 

Still, if this is not a decoy, an evidently fabricated Japanese [454] identity might be rooted in a link to 
this unique, Far-East [758] country, like family, friends, or fondness of the rich, ancient, or modern 
East-Asian  culture;  for  instance,  Mark  Karpelès  [120],  the  CEO  of  the  notorious  Bitcoin  exchange 
Mt.Gox [120, 819, 820] in 2010, moved from his native country of France [931] to Japan [454], as he 
was fascinated by Manga [932] / Anime [933]. 

In this context,  a (faint)  link  might  be  constructed with the monthly manga magazine “Nakayoshi” 
[934] ("Good Friends"), and its popular title “Cardcaptor Sakura” [935]; however, the target readership 
for  Nakayoshi  is  teenage  girls.  Another magna  series  titled “Naruto”  [936, 937]  is  written and  illu-
strated by Masashi Kishimoto [938]. While some syllables may have inspired the pseudonym of the 
creator of Bitcoin, they are also quite common in the Japanese language, and this connection thus 
seems to be quite unspecific. 

Internet Service Provider 

There is actually another interesting pointer towards Japan, specifically to its capital city of Tokyo [61, 
760]. Satoshi Nakamoto frequently used, in addition to his account with the (German [655]) provider 
gmx.com [175, 251, 939], the email domains anonymousspeech.com [252, 253, 940] (shut down on 
30/09/2021) and vistomail.com [254-256, 941, 942] (defunct as per time of writing), for instance, on 
the “The Cryptography and Cryptography Policy Mailing List” [283] when announcing the release of 
Bitcoin v0.1 [943]. 

These providers offered highly privacy-preserving email services, and anonymousspeech.com tempo-
rarily accepted anonymous payment in e-Gold [384, 385, 944], and, anecdotally, later Bitcoin [61]. In 
a story published in 2014 [118], several links, e.g., via domain registration addresses for email pro-
viders, bitcoin.org  [257, 258, 328, 356], and a Swiss bank  account, were  construed via the elusive, 
(presumably)  by  the  elusive  Swiss  internet  entrepreneur  “Michael  Weber”  [941,  942,  945] 
(wwwmichi@gmx.ch),  notably  to  Sakura  House  [61,  941,  946,  947]  and  Lounge  [947].  (Note  that 
several  insiders  coherently  commented  that  “Micheal  Weber”  might  have  just  been  a  commonly 
known fake identify for covering up identifies.) 

Sakura House 

These places in Tokyo [760], which are obviously named after the Japanese cherry blossoming, offer 
apartments and facilities that are preferentially rented by foreigners. Interestingly, the Sakura House 
and Lounge are situated near in the Nakano-sakaue station [948] for the Tokyo districts of Nakano 
[949]  and  Shinjuku  [950],  which  are  notorious  amusement  quarters  that  are  well-known  as  gay 
hotspots (Shinjuku Ni-chōme [951]), and for sex-related establishments (Kabukichō [952]). There was 
also several branches of the American fast fashion retailer “Forever 21” at the time in Tokyo and other 
parts of Japan [953, 954]. 

Stint in Japan 

This intriguing plot constitutes one of the very few direct connections that could be quite convincingly 
established between Satoshi Nakamoto and Japan [454]. (Other than that one of the founding fathers 
of blockchain [5, 955], who co-authored 3/8 papers cited in the Bitcoin whitepaper, speaks Japanese.) 

In a conceivable scenario, Satoshi Nakamoto had a stint in Tokyo around the year 2006, staying at the 
Sakura  guest  house,  possibly  for  studies,  work,  fun,  or  a  combination  thereof;  during  this  period, 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  (re-)connected  to  the  owner  of  the  highly  privacy  focused  email  services 
anonymousspeech.com and vistomail.com who resided, or had his web portals registered to these 

facilities.  Having  enjoyed  his  time,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  got  inspired  by  the  locality,  i.e.,  specifically 
Sakura,  Nakano  and  Nakano-sakaue,  and  the  “Nakano  Sakaue  gang”  [118]  that  was  anecdotally 
reported to have been around in these locations the year 2006, to adopt his pseudonym from the first 
syllables of the local ambient. 
Matching Story 

With  all  these  cues  at  hand,  it  can  be  speculated  that  Satoshi  Nakamoto  likely  has  a  Western 
educational and cultural background, either British / European or North-American, possibly pertaining 
to an ethnic minority, such as Japanese-American. In the years immediately prior to developing Bitcoin 
in 2007/2008, Satoshi Nakamoto might have stayed for a certain period, or at least immersed with an 
expat  community  in  Tokyo  that  inspired  his  alias  (possibly  in  addition  to  its  “intelligence”  related 
interpretation, see above). 
Japanese Candidates 

Japanese  candidates  were  proposed  in  a  2017  presentation  [124-126].  The  senior  author,  who 
published  a  conference  contribution  [612,  673]  referenced  in  the  Bitcoin  whitepaper  (2)  [175], 
scrutinizes a 2001 publication entitled “The Security Evaluation of Time Stamping Schemes: The Pre-
sent  Situation  and  Studies”  [129,  956],  which  is authored  by  a  Japanese  person  affiliated  with  the 
Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies (IMES) [957] from the Bank of Japan [958]. 

The source finds stunning intersection between some core technological elements that later entered 
Bitcoin, as well as the references cited in their report and the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. Moreover, the 
personal  homepage  of  the  author  of  the  report  [956]  was  last  updated  09/02/2007,  i.e.,  roughly 
around  the  time  when  Satoshi  Nakamoto  must  have  started  conceiving  and  developing  Bitcoin. 
Another Japanese candidate was proposed to have created Bitcoin in a rather quirky YouTube video 
[127] in 2013 by the American computer scientist and co-inventor of hypertext [257, 258]. However, 
these leads never seemed to have received significant traction in the community.  
Privacy & Anonymity 
Highly Refined Armor 
As a mere fact that, even until today, i.e., nearly 1½ decades after the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper 
in fall 2008, and despite major efforts to track him, Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity has not been 
unraveled; this impressively proves that he was able to employ sophisticated methods to persistently 
protect his anonymity. Using a pseudonym was only one part of his cleverly and skillfully devised, and 
vigorously executed privacy  shield,  for which he effectuate(d) a very strict separation between his 
online and real personality. 
As Satoshi Nakamoto, he never communicated through analog channels like handwriting, voice, video, 
or personal meetings; instead, he exclusively messaged electronically via email, and postings to online 
newsgroups, essentially “sterilized” ASCII [575] text. Potential “eye-witnesses”, whether involved in 
Bitcoin, or just accidentally noticing related activities, do not exist, or are at least not willing “testify” 
(yet). 

Direct clues, for instance, to his bio, family, friends, socializing, cultural background, (inter-)nationality, 
political attitudes, physical appearance, (dis-)abilities, coining / traumatic experiences, hobbies, sense 
of humor, education, and professional vita, are widely missing. Even worse, the scant, and rather shaky 
hints  Satoshi  Nakamoto  left  in  his  messages  might  be  a  part  of  his  intelligently  and  diligently 
orchestrated cover-up. Thus, pretty much all digital evidence available from and about the father of 
Bitcoin has to be taken with caution.  

Moreover, Satoshi Nakamoto employed technologies like the Tor [407] (“The Onion Router” [408], a 
free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication) network [408, 959] and I2P 
[409] (“The Invisible Internet Project”), he somehow found a way to register bitcoin.org [257, 258, 

328, 960] incognito with a prepaid credit card [118, 960], established email accounts at highly privacy-
focused domains like vistomail.com [254-256] (defunct as per time of writing), anonymousspeech.com 
[252, 253, 940] (shut down on 30/09/2021), and gmx.com [251, 939, 961] for concealing his identity 
and location. These capabilities unambiguously display the signature of an experienced, very privacy-
conscious character versed in skills which are actually quite common among cryptographers, but very 
rare in beyond these small circles. 
Disciplined Character 
As  per  the  whole  setup  of  his  persona,  per  his  strict  adherence  to  online  communication  and  his 
avoidance  of  live,  in-person  interaction,  and  his  sudden  disappearance  from  the  community,  it  is 
obvious that Satoshi Nakamoto was extremely clear and consequent in his decision making, and very 
solitary; he carefully avoided the limelight by expressing that others, like fellow developers from the 
steadily growing Bitcoin community, should represent the emerging cryptocurrency project in public. 
It might also be inferred from the continuing success in maintaining his privacy and anonymity over 
long periods of time, and by his prolonged abstinence from reaping the fruits of his incredible wealth, 
fame and impact, that Bitcoin was unlikely to have been created by a group. 
Forgoing Pseudonymous Communication 
Note that, in principle, Satoshi Nakamoto could have, and of course still can, include short texts in 
transactions (through a 40 Byte metadata by the Bitcoin script command OP_RETURN [962]); if they 
are issued from Bitcoin addresses the community widely accepts to be owned by him [216, 374, 375], 
such messages would surely send some ripples to developers and markets. But Satoshi Nakamoto has 
(so far) not once tapped this pseudonymous communication channel, that is incorporated into his own 
Bitcoin (node) software. 
Techniques 

Yet,  it  might  well  be  argued  that,  as  an  undoubtedly  exceptionally  sophisticated  computer-  and 
internet-literate who is evidently proficient in deploying advanced privacy technology [404-410, 963], 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  might  have  easily  run  message  texts  past  spell  and  grammar  checkers  set  to 
(occasionally intersperse) British English, insert double-spacing after a full stop into ASCII ([964]) texts, 
tune computer clocks and time zone [231] settings of operating systems, and manipulate sent times 
and forge metadata in email headers. 

Institutional Cover-Up? 

While  there  are  serious  speculations,  e.g.,  by  virtue  of  the  interpretation  of  his  pseudonym  (see 
above),  that  an  intelligence  organization  might  conceived  and  implemented  Bitcoin.  Other  than 
certain “rogue states” [965], e.g., to circumvent internationally enforced economic sanctions [966], 
the author could not come up with a solid reasoning, and convincing plot. 

As also discussed in other sections of this article, it is known that the CIA [554] had an eye on Bitcoin, 
at latest when they invited Gavin Andresen [75] for a presentation that eventually took place in mid-
2011. Nowadays, they are even “deeply involved” in the cryptocurrency space [854, 855]. In addition, 
the DHS [817] seems to have arranged a meeting with “Satoshi Nakamoto” [816], 2022 #7071}. 

The author could only speculate that there might have been so government interest to stop, or at least 
control Bitcoin, but the genie may have already been out of the bottle at that stage due to decentra-
lization. So, the best they could do at that point was to put pressure on Satoshi Nakamoto, e.g., by 
threatening to report him/her/them for potential tax evasion to the IRS [878], issuing non-compliant 
issuing of a security to the SEC [534], or infringing with the “coinage power” of congress engraved in 
the US Constitution [535]. 

Under such serious intimidation, Satoshi Nakamoto might have budged and transferred his private 
keys, and possibly access to his online accounts, to a federal agency, e.g., to be able to wield some 
over Bitcoin in case it became a menace to national interest. In this entirely hypothetical constellation, 
the governmental organizations involved would surely not have any interest, neither in the disclosure 
of the deal, nor in unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto.  

Furnished  with  the  full  playbook  of  professionally  managed  and  organizationally  sanctioned 
techniques at hand, such as identity replacement technology [963], e.g., adopted from witness [967], 
whistleblower protection [968], or espionage [969] programs, Satoshi Nakamoto would evade most 
of the attribute mapping and exclusion filtering methods developed in this article; the investigation 
would then go way beyond the reach of the author of this article. 
Impersonation 

An  element  of  a  wide-ranging  identity  spoof  [963]  would  be  to  install  an  impersonator  [970]  to 
direction attention away from him/her/them. Among the many possible constellations, Satoshi Naka-
moto might have (even pseudonymously) contracted a sufficiently competent person with a suitable 
vita, and coordinated a reasonably plausible narrative with him/her. Equipped with a carefully scoped, 
bullet-proof story and tactical plan with Satoshi Nakamoto as advisor and insinuator in the backhand, 
this “bait” would step into the public to mislead his “chasers” onto the wrong trail, and thus keep 
them  busy,  and  leaving  them  discouraged.  However,  the  author  of  this  article  does  not  hold  any 
tangible evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto deployed such shrewd tactics. 
Work Pattern 
Day of the Week 
There is a markedly high frequency of Saturdays in the events that Satoshi Nakamoto had some room 
to maneuver with. These are his date of birth on Saturday, 05/04/1975 [863], and the Genesis block 0 
[302] mined on Saturday, 03/01/2009 [739]. In Japanese time zone, also the release of the seminal 
Bitcoin whitepaper  was  dated on  Saturday, 01/11/2008 [561]. Note that in GMT  / UTC or  US time 
zones, the announcement of Bitcoin v0.1 [306] was on Thursday, 08/01/2009 [308], and the mining of 
block  1  [305]  on  09/01/2009  [764],  as  well  as  the  publication  of  the  Bitcoin  whitepaper  [175]  on 
31/10/2008 [279] fell on Fridays. So, in general, a trend for the build-up of outcomes can be observed 
towards the end of the work week, and work day, when referenced to GMT [239]. 
However,  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  activities  on  Bitcoin-related online  fora 
discloses marked dips on Tuesdays and Saturdays [66]. 
Peak Activity Months 
Analysis  of  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  postings  to  newsgroups  and  commits  to  the  Bitcoin  subversion 
repository in the final months of 2009 and 2010 [172] reveals activity peaks, involving “night shifts”, 
in February, a noticeable gap between March and May, resuming intensive activity over the following 
summer months [66]. 
Activity and Time Zones 

In  the  GMT  [239]  time  zone  [231],  which  applies  to  the  United  Kingdom  [599]  (roughly)  between 
November and March. While activities start building up from 11 am, Satoshi Nakamoto mostly posted 
between 3 pm and 2 am, regardless of weekdays or weekends. Silence is recorded between 6 am and 
11 am, likely indicating his sleeping schedule. This would correspond to rather normal hours from 1 
am to 6 am in US-Eastern time zone (ET [280]), which is (for the most part of the year [236, 237]) 5 
hours behind GMT [239]. 

If he had resided in the US-Mountain (MT [595]) or Pacific time zone (PT [755]), Satoshi Nakamoto 
would have gone to sleep rather early, i.e., way before midnight, which would be atypical, especially 
for (younger) coders. Residence in Far-Eastern [758] time zones, e.g., Japanese Standard Time (JST) 

[562], may only apply to daylight sleepers, a highly unnatural schedule which would mainly apply to 
people on night-shift (labor) job rosters. 
Job Type 
This fluctuating pattern may correspond to work obligations that are not compatible with a regular 
office job, but more for a student or academic who is busy on campus during lecture months in college, 
or a contractor,  consultant  or  freelancer working  along tight project completion schedules; even a 
seasonal schedule of a farmer has been brought forward [971]. 

Due to the brevity of  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s online life,  and his likely capability to forge metadata to 
disguise  his  identity  and  whereabouts,  it  cannot  be  ultimately  concluded  whether  this  calendrical, 
work-hour and time-zone [172, 231] consistencies were just specific to the (post Bitcoin-whitepaper) 
period of observation, or recurrent over preceding and consecutive years. 
Professional Embedding 
Secret Service 
While there is some solid indication of Satoshi Nakamoto having participated in academic research, 
e.g., as a postgraduate student [728] or postdoctoral [729] scholar at a university, Satoshi Nakamoto 
might have (also) had a (possibly even brief) career in, or related to, cryptography in the corporate 
sector,  or  in  a  secret  service  institution.  These  organizations  regularly  recruit  top  (mathematical) 
talent, that they identify based on their educational scores, to their relevant departments. 

Before embarking him on a dedicated cryptography training, these three-letter intelligence agencies 
[460, 461, 544, 554, 842-849, 851, 852] would have rigorously committed Satoshi Nakamoto to strict 
confidentiality over extended periods of time, even extending way beyond the actual duration of his 
employment or contract [972]. 
Such  thoroughly  monitored  obligations  might  explain  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  apparent  fear  towards 
exposure of the nascent Bitcoin project to the CIA [554] in 2011. Personally, he might have even been 
scared to be in breach of grave commitments to his confidentiality, which actually would prevent him 
from coming out for a long time, if not forever. 
Freelancer or Contractor 
It is also known that highly capable cryptographers would have generously paid options as freelancers 
or contractors in industry, or even on the dark side, which would elucidate why Satoshi Nakamoto 
might have had sufficient money to be able to abstain from monetizing his BTC assets after his sudden 
disappearance; more  likely,  his  staunch  ideals  might  have  directed  him  towards  leaving  his  (early) 
mined coins (so far mostly) untouched, in order to bolster a catchy narrative of a mysterious origin, 
and intrinsically endowing innate decentralization; this approach indeed still deeply appreciated by 
“his” Bitcoin community. 
Computing Setup 
Computer Operating System 
Through his communication and digital fingerprint, it can be deduced that Satoshi Nakamoto initially 
ran a Microsoft Windows (XP) [591] operating system, only later he installed Linux [973], and asked 
others to port and test  Bitcoin on  Apple’s Mac OS  [974], which he evidently never ran on  his own 
machine. As already pointed out earlier, in the section of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], the (easy to 
massage)  metadata,  and  other  evidence,  indicate  that  it  was  produced  by  OpenOffice.org  [579], 
version 2.4, with PDF [286] version 1.4 formatted (print) output. 
Programming Language 

Bitcoin was coded in C++ [975], working with the “Feemium” [976], integrated development environ-
ment (IDE) [977] for multiple programming languages, Microsoft Visual Studio [978]. The C++ language 

is rather popular with elder programmers, typically born before the 1980s; younger coders might have 
opted for modern languages like JavaScript [979] or Ruby [980]. Experts opined that Satoshi Naka-
moto’s  C++  skills  revealed  in  the  Bitcoin  source  code  was  equivalent  to  5-10  years  of  specific 
programming experience. With these advanced capabilities at hand, it can be well contended that C++ 
offers more control than more modern languages towards specifically customizing the cryptographic 
security for the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Hardware 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  also  seemed  to  have  run  somewhat  mediocre  computer  hardware,  neither 
equipped with an Intel Core i5 [981] or AMD [982] processor, thus exhibiting rather mediocre hash 
rate. This comparatively inferior computing [983] power (CPUs [983] were sufficient for mining at the 
time) is uncharacteristic for a high-caliber programmer might rule out opulent financial resources of 
Satoshi Nakamoto around the birth and infancy of Bitcoin. 
The distinct blend of Microsoft Windows [591], Microsoft Visual Studio [978] for coding, OpenOffice 
[579]  for  publishing,  and  fair  CPU  performance  for  mining  would  be  uncommon  among  academic 
cryptographers  and  cypherpunks,  and  thus  represent  a  unique  recognition  feature  of  Satoshi 
Nakamoto (at the time). 
Interdisciplinary Skill Set 
Computing & Cryptography 

In addition to his unquestionably outstanding (C++ [975]) programming abilities [366, 367, 369], as 
exhibited in the first version of  the Bitcoin code [306], Satoshi Nakamoto must  have,  at least, had 
some advanced knowledge and passion for a strikingly rare combination of techno-scientific fields; 
this unusually wide interdisciplinary repertoire encompasses elements of cryptography [250], (digital) 
timestamping  [171]  (2-5)  [612-615]  as  the  precursor  of  blockchain  [5],  proof-of-work  (POW)  [316, 
984], computer science (e.g., distributed computing [985], peer-to-peer (P2P) networks [986], decen-
tralization [987, 988]), probability theory (8) [557], economics (e.g., game theory, financial systems, 
banking, money, market psychology), and law (e.g., financial regulation, freedom of speech). 
Electronic Cash 
Regarding  digital  currencies,  evidence  stays  inconclusive  to  which  extent  Satoshi  Nakamoto  was 
involved  (under  his  real  identity  or  another  alias)  in  the  cypherpunk  [165,  166]  movement  that 
spawned in the early 1990s from the Bay Area [675] in California [493]; his alleged (or mock) lack of 
awareness of (at least part of) related precursor projects [262, 268, 271, 272, 463, 465, 467, 468, 470, 
472-475, 478, 481, 611, 621, 989, 990], to some extent including (1) [269] (1) and (6) [270], might be 
owing  to  the  absence  of  a  specialized  scientific  community  and  publishing  scene  on  this  crypto-
currencies at the time, but also linked to his (young) age in the 1990s. Furthermore, this apparent 
unfamiliarity with  important  prior  art  reveals that intellectually,  Satoshi Nakamoto may have even 
independently developed, or re-invented, key pillars of Bitcoin, while he was cognizant of the foun-
dations of timestamping and blockchain [613-615, 955, 991, 992]. 
Main Inventory Step 

From a formal, intellectual property perspective, it is widely accepted [1] that Satoshi Nakamoto has 
authored the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] in 2008, and was part of Bitcoin’s original reference implement-
tation. In the course of this, Satoshi Nakamoto devised the first blockchain database, through which 
he was the first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currencies using a (decentralized) 
distributed ledger [707] via a peer-to-peer (DLT) [986] network. By combination with cryptographic 
proof-of-work (PoW) [316, 993], he eliminated a central point of failure, which constituted a decisive 
weakness in previous attempts. 

Genius 
According to the various statements [366, 367, 369] of independent, highly recognized experts, an 
ingenious intellectual virtuoso [609, 994] [994] must have cleverly designed and successfully delivered 
Bitcoin [491]. A genius stands out by undeniable talent, resolve, and success, but he often does not 
meet societally widely accepted behavioral schemes. Or in the words of the impactful, 19th century 
German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer [995]: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits 
a target no one else can see”. Satoshi Nakamoto’s uniqueness is impressively underpinned by his far-
ranging  spectrum  of,  in  parts  presumably  self-taught,  interdisciplinary  competences,  tremendous 
work ethic, and volatile biography. 
Common Traits 

While there is no “one-fits-all template” for a genius, their outstanding talent is normally confined to 
a select area; their major commonality is that they are atypical, their overall character and psychology 
[994] regularly falls out-of-the-norm. Many of such extraordinarily intelligent personalities clash with 
generic societal templates in terms of common behavioral traits, such as pronounced modesty, rather 
poor sociability, unusual sense of humor, and major volatility in their biographies. 
A genius tends to have a peculiar sense of humor which is mostly inapt for small-talk, he might be 
inclined  to  understate  (introvert)  or  oversell  (extrovert)  their  sophisticated  ideas,  he  shows  major 
discontinuities in  his private and professional  life, with departures from projects  that  he considers 
delivered earlier than others, and may resurface with new, disruptive or unexpected initiatives that 
are primarily motivated by his portfolio of ideals. 

Such erratically perceived decision making may reflect signs of abnormal psychological conditions, or 
even a degree of mental disorder [996-999]. These rare species can intensively work long hours with 
extreme focus and persistence on solving extremely challenging problems they feel passionate about. 
They usually do not retire in a classical sense, their brain needs to offload its energy, for instance, via 
in interest-, or ideals-driven activities in business or leisure. 
Cryptographers 

In particular highly gifted mathematicians in the field of cryptographers often detest races for fame 
and for showing off their fortune; instead, they frequently show a preference for privacy, and even 
complete reclusion. They may have an apathy against testosterone-driven power games and hierar-
chies, e.g., within federal agencies, or the corporate sector, and get easily frustrated when discovering 
that the main focus of initiatives they care about is not on the delivery of factual solutions, but on 
personal career objectives. 
Strategy Games 
Furthermore,  especially  math-affine  geniuses  [613-615]  are  frequently  bestowed  with  an 
extraordinary talent to quickly recognize patterns in arrangements of numbers, letters, or geometries, 
and they often enjoy tackling and creating puzzles. This particular type of intellectual high performers 
sometimes  tends  to  have  a  penchant  for  strategic  games  involving  statistics  and  memory,  e.g., 
involving card counting, pattern recognition, and complex strategies, such as the banking games Poker 
[1000, 1001], Blackjack [1002-1004], as well as the table and board games Backgammon [1005], and 
Chess [1006] (or its Japanese variant Shogi [1007]). 

For instance, as pointed out further above, the prodigy chess player Bobby Fischer [555], who blended 
genius in the game as, for instance, documented by his world-famous 21-move brilliancy [558], with a 
rather turbulent professional and private vita, might have been one of Satoshi Nakamoto’s childhood 
heroes. It is also known that a few such gambling-affine “superbrains” were banned at some stage 
from casinos  in  Atlantic  City  or  Las  Vegas,  e.g.,  the  notorious  “MIT  Blackjack  Team”  [1008], which 
operated successfully from about 1980 to the beginning of the 21st century. 

Celebrities 

There are numerous, historical and present-day ingenious celebrities, e.g., artists, actors, filmmakers, 
entrepreneurs,  and  scholars,  who  are  (sometimes  arguably)  reported  to  have  displayed  some 
(episodes  of)  mental  abnormalities  [999,  1009],  including  bipolar  disorder  [1010],  schizophrenia 
[1011],  Asperger  syndrome  [1012],  and  autism  [1013,  1014],  or  an  imposter  syndrome  [1015]. 
Amongst the  most  famous  personalities in science and technology are  Isaac  Newton  [1016, 1017], 
Charles  Darwin  [1018],  Ludwig  Boltzmann  [1019],  Albert  Einstein  [1020],  Paul  Dirac  [1021],  Nikola 
Tesla [1022], John Nash [90], Richard Feynman [1023], Grigori Perelman [1024], Steve Jobs [14], Terry 
A. Davis [1025], John McAfee [1026], and Elon Musk [15, 1027].  

Bitcoin Parameters 
On  their  journey  into  Bitcoin,  readers  usually  stumble  across  mysteries  that  they  cannot  make 
immediate sense of. These frequently concern the technical or practical reasoning for the choices of 
the (targetted) block time 
, the halving period of

 blocks, roughly corresponding to

The values of these parameters sculpturing Bitcoin are not fully explained in its whitepaper [175]; yet, 
email correspondence between Satoshi Nakamoto and early adopters [355, 1028, 1029] details some 
objectives.  The  following  considerations  are  unavoidably  quite  technical  and  mathematical,  so  the 
reader might fast-forward to the last subsection “Take-Home Messages” if not interested in the speci-
fics.

the nodes should not spend too much time on futile mining efforts when the next block has already 
been found [1030]. 
For  instance,  with  the

represent current internet and future internet speeds) assumed in Satoshi Nakamoto’s back-of-the-
envelope calculations, about 
 of the mining efforts would be deterministically ”wasted”

operate  (full)  Bitcoin  nodes,  and  consequently,  severely  undermine  Bitcoin’s  pivotal  concept  of 
decentralization through prolific and unrestricted network participation. 
Such de-facto marginalization of contributors to the distributed ledger is averted under the condition 
that  the  storage  space  of  commodity  hard  drives  grows  faster  than  the  write  speed  .  This  issue 
constituted one of the main disputes in the Bitcoin “civil war” in the mid-2010s, associated with the 
(eventually unsuccessful) Bitcoin XT [9] fork, and follow-ups like the controversial Bitcoin SV [1032]. 
At  the  time  of  writing  (mid  2022),  i.e.,  about  13  years  after  its  launch  in  2009,  the  full  size  of  the 
Bitcoin’s distributed ledger file ranges in the vicinity of 350 GB. 
Transaction Throughput 

𝑊𝑊

As  the  peer-to-peer  payment  system  alluded  to  in  the  very  title  of  its  whitepaper  [175],  speed, 
measured in transactions per second (TPS), is a common benchmark. While each block has a maximum 
size of 
, as engraved in the code, the storage space for each of its transactions varies, for 
instance,  as  they  can  contain  different  amounts  of  Bitcoin  addresses  and  script  commands,  called 
opcodes [1033]. Using an average size of

For comparison, the VISA network is capable of , which might be the reason why layer-2 solutions, 
such as the Lightening [1036] or Liquid [1037-1039] networks, are, or have already been, developed 
and implemented for Bitcoin as fast, consumer-level payment solutions headlined in its whitepaper 
[1040]. 
Halving 
Satoshi Nakamoto’s plot for Bitcoin was obviously to issue a finite supply of BTC. Mathematically, this 
somewhat clever and altruistic objective requires a special distribution function that converges to a 
fixed number over time. Amongst the many options for the BTC minting policy, he chose a stepwise 
adjustment which periodically halves the initial reward for the miner, called coinbase transaction.

𝑇𝑇H ≈ 4

The logic behind the halving interval 
 years is not immediately evident, other than its potential 
correspondence  to  the  leap  year  schedule,  or  typical  legislative  periods  of  democratically  elected 
governments. This peculiar choice might furthermore indicate Satoshi Nakamoto’s intent to maneuver

The fixed total supply 
[339]:

“In this sense, it's [Bitcoin is] more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep 
the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, 
the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the 
value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.” 

on 11/02/2009. 
Only  a  second  source  is  cited  in  an  email  [1028,  1029]  exchanged  in  January  2011  with  an  early 
adopter, who directly conversed with, and received BTC from Satoshi Nakamoto in spring 2009. It was 
surmised [353, 1028, 1029] that Satoshi Nakamoto’s choice of the 21 million of BTC was inferred from 
the  (global)  money  supply  [1043]  of  fiat  currencies 
,  which  (reportedly,  but  not  accurately) 
amounted to roughly 21 trillion USD at the time of releasing the Bitcoin whitepaper in fall 2008. M1 
money comprises of all the currencies and assets that can easily be converted into cash. 

𝑀𝑀1

Satoshi Nakamoto is  quoted [353]: “I wanted to pick  something that would make prices similar to 
existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in 
the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you 
imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million 
coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”

supply in the region or 21 million BTC would be favorable towards minimizing rounding errors when 
operating in the realm of a 64-bit floating-point arithmetic [1045]. The author of this work does not 
follow this argument.) 

However, in a different email [355], Satoshi Nakamoto disclosed to have played a bit with this number, 
initially considering 42: “I thought about

high.” The notion “seems high” does not make much sense, if 21 is eventually chosen. Also note that

Inflation Rate 
For multiple reasons, a classical inflation rate is hard to define. First, Bitcoin started without exclusive 
pre-launch mining (except the genesis block) by its creator, i.e., from an initial BTC amount of literally 
zero  in  January  2009.  Second,  the  BTC  supply  is  not  continuously  increased  by  a  government  to 
implement  certain  fiscal  policies  and  to  satisfy  consumer  psychology,  but  by  the  need  to  secure  a 
decentralized ledger on a blockchain. 

Furthermore, it is not clear how the transaction fees, which will likely rise in their fiat value over time, 
should be factored in. Finally, with increased minting of new BTC and halving cycles, the inflation rate 
decreases until it deterministically merges to zero (i.e., below BTC’s non-divisible subunit of 1 Sat). 

 
 
Note, however, that fading rewards for participating in the crucial proof-of-work [993] competition 
will have to be compensated, to some degree, by transaction fees to still incentivize miners in the 
PoW-secured [993] public ledger. 
Mathematically, we  can  define  an  (annual) inflation rate at block number

At the time of writing in 2022, the lion share of the reward originates from the coinbase transaction 
.  In  an  order  of  magnitude  calculation,  this 
equals to about 100,000 USD, and, for simplicity, we assume 2,000 transactions per block. This back-

of-the-envelope  calculation  essentially  suggests  that,  currently,  a  cost  per  transaction  of  about 
50 USD. 
As long as this amount is mainly covered by the coinbase reward, the actual transaction fees paid by 
the user remain much lower. However, this necessitates that the ratio of demand-to-supply for BTC

on  exchanges  stays  sufficiently  high;  a  dropping  USD-BTC  pair  also  lowers  the  hash  rate,  and  thus

Let’s consider two examples while neglecting inflation, which will most likely affect the BTC price and 
mining expenses in a similar manner. For

century, less than 0.05 BTC will be newly issued per block, meaning that one BTC would have to sell at 
about 2 million USD at exchanges in order to restrict transaction fees to present levels.

Therefore, and in addition to the limited transaction throughput, Bitcoin can only meet the economic 
requirements of a micropayment system if the number of transactions that can be crammed into a

The detailed scrutiny of Bitcoin’s design parameters underpins the following hypothesis: The target 
values for the block time 
 are prescribed by real-
world boundary conditions of a deliberately decentralized peer-to-peer [986] payment system relying 
on a distributed public ledger [1047] file. The evidence in this section suggests that Satoshi Nakamoto 
then needed to choose a proper finite total supply 
 of his new cryptocurrency, and a commonly 
accepted mechanism to deal out 
 for incentivizing widescale participation in Proof-of-Work [984]

A  fixed  total  supply

he also opted for the (generic) binary operation of halving. Satoshi Nakamoto then played around with 
the numbers and  found  that only a

“fairer” distribution of Bitcoin over several generations well into the next century.

In a similar way as shown in the preceding section, Satoshi Nakamoto probably experimented with a 
few alternative parameter sets, but was content to have found a sweet spot in the parameter space 
where the binary system for alluding to his new, computer-based digital currency, quantitatively “mat-
ches”  the  legacy  monetary  system.  As  we  will  see  in  the  following,  and  to  the  possible  delight  of 
Satoshi Nakamoto, the resulting, rather “weird” numbers 21 and 42 nicely lent themselves to further 
analogies;  these  figures  convey  messages  reflecting  historical  and  societal  happenings  as  well  as  a 
portion of “nerdy” fun relevant to both, the creator and the creation of Bitcoin. 
Features in Code 
The original 0.1.0 Bitcoin code also has some intriguing details [1048], such as an IRC [1049] client, a 
P2P [986] marketplace, and a virtual Poker [1000] game. Especially the latter feature might be picked

Digits & Numeral Systems – Vires in Numeris 
By  constructing  a  new  persona,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  had  a  broad  range  of  options  in  fabricating  his 
pseudonym, age, and nationality. It could be observed that such (widely) self-definable biodata and 
dates of Bitcoin, while protecting his privacy, may contain messages that fit very well with the psycho-
gram of a genius, the historic and current events at the time, and his socio-economic attitudes. It is 
also quite striking that the “odd” number 21 repeatedly occurs in the rather free design parameters 
within the setup of Bitcoin, often without conclusive technical reasoning. 
It can be conjectured that these digits, as well as further peculiarities excavated in the following, may 
convey  one,  or  potentially  more,  messages  conceived  by  the  elusive  mastermind  of  Bitcoin.  This 
section identifies and delivers potential interpretations of such “suspicious” numbers to eventually 
extract some information about Satoshi Nakamoto’s attitudes and sense of humor around Bitcoin. A 
plaque stating “I am … and live in …” is highly unlikely to have been deployed by Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Note that, to the best of the author’s knowledge, Satoshi Nakamoto did not suggest looking for any 
hidden stories; yet, they might have been a joke for his self-amusement, and not for the public, and 
thus  reflect  an  aspect  of  his  state-of-mind  at  the  time.  But  in  the  end,  there  is  a  non-negligible 
probability that (even all of) the following interpretations are unintended, possibly putting a bright 
smile on Satoshi Nakamoto’s face when reading them. Yet, there is also a chance they might form 
essential artefacts of the mysterious riddle he left for the world to untangle. Nevertheless, a proposed 
candidate passing all more vigorous exclusion criteria presented before, and then also meeting a few 
of the following criteria certainly reinforces his/her/their “Satoshiness”. 
Why 21? 
What strikes most Bitcoin enthusiasts is the choice of the often almost religiously deemed total supply 
 of 21 million BTC. Following the previous considerations (1), this BTC limit could have been freely 
selected, e.g., by adjusting the original coinbase transaction 
 accordingly; in fact, most would have 
𝑀𝑀tot
either expected a quantity in the decimal system, such as ten, a hundred, or multiples of 1,000, to 
arrive at convenient names like million, billion, trillion [1042], or in the binary system [1051], i.e., a 
power of 2, or even a byte-based [1052] amount, that can be expressed in the commonly used units 
kB, MB, GB or TB, in the quasi-decimal, octal domain.

We have already seen that 21 also pops up in other contexts, like the 
 blocks per halving 
, the first two digits of the year when the final coinbase transaction will be issued, 
interval 
and the cross sum of  the block 1’s (somewhat freely set) date of mining. Further occurrences  and 
potential meanings of 21 (and 42) will be unveiled in the next sections. 
As almost any clue derived in this article, each of them might, per se, be fully coincidental, unintended, 
and even outrageously overinterpreted. Moreover, it is also very likely that the author has blatantly

story. But for now, let us take it a step further before making a final judgement.

Decimals 
There is also some sprinkle of the decimal system in the block time and the subunits of BTC in the 
  tokens,  i.e.,  atomic 
setup,  specifically  in  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  choice  of  subdividing 
subunits of “Satoshis”, or merely “Sats”. Here,  a typical value linked  to signed or unsigned integer

Other Numeral and Binary-to-Text Systems 
The  author  could  not  scavenge  any  evidence  of  further  messages,  e.g.,  be  expressing  “Satoshi 
Nakamoto”  in  other  encoding  systems,  such  as  hexadecimal  [1053],  or  any  piece  yielding  Bitcoin 
addresses in its base-58 encoding [1054]. Also ASCII code [964], or Roman numerals [1055] did not 
yield any compelling outcomes. 
Bitcoin Keys and Addresses 
Maybe one  can  juggle  with  some  elements,  like  the  pseudonym  Nakamoto,  and  applying  Bitcoin’s 
Elliptic Curve Cryptography [1056] (“ECC”, specifically the secp256k standard) for generating public 
keys, and then hashing by SHA256 followed by RIPEMD160 algorithms may disclose some further cues, 
e.g., when stated in the common alphanumeric base-58 system [1054]. 

𝐶𝐶0

In an email to early adopter Hal Finney dated Monday, 12 January 2009 [1057] at 8:41 AM [299, 300, 
1058], Satoshi Nakamoto observed that the Bitcoin address 

 ‘1NSwywA5Dvuyw89sfs3oLPvLiDNGf48cPD’ [815] 
which he had (fortuitously) generated (but which received its first BTC transaction only on 31/08/2014 
[1059])  contained  his  initials  (in  the  reverse  Japanese  order  NS,  i.e.,  last  name  followed  by  given 
name),  and  elaborated  on  how  users  could  intentionally  generate  such  vanity  Bitcoin  addresses 
containing words or names through computational brute-force efforts. 

Note that the (Japanese ordered) initials N.S. would evidently fit well to a cryptocurrency pioneer, 
Nick  Szabo  [71],  who  conceived  Bit  Gold  [262]  in  the  2000s,  arguably  deemed  the  technologically 
closest precursor to Bitcoin. While this reclusive person is quite concordantly acknowledged by the 
expert community as one of the few candidates to have had the know-how to develop Bitcoin in 2008, 
he adamantly denies being Satoshi Nakamoto [65]. 

Alphabet 

Numbers can be associated with letters according to their ordering in the alphabet, and possibly also 
with other meanings in a mathematical context. A few connections may be construed, e.g., 
 0: 
  B:  Bitcoin, 
Neutral  element  of  addition,  1 
0 ↦
Blockchain, Binary, Bay Area, Berkeley, 4 
 D: Decentralization, Distributed Ledge Technology (DLT),

very weak.

 yields 21. For similar geometrical 
Counting the spots on the six faces of a dice 
reasoning, 21 is also referred to as a triangle number [1060]. Moreover, a common dice is arranged 
so that each pair of opposite sides adds up to 7, so offering the alternative calculation 
. 
These  geometrical  associations,  which  a  math  genius  recognizes  quasi  instantaneously,  allude  to 
3 × 7 = 21
“rolling the dice”, which is a common theme in the mathematical discipline of probability (calculus); 
this syntax may point to the topic of the 1957-textbook citation (8) [557] in the Bitcoin whitepaper 
[175], and further reference the popular table game of Craps [1061] in the realm of gambling. 

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6

Geometrically, the dice is shaped like a cube or block, which then evokes the notion of blockchain in 
the context of Bitcoin. Consequently, there exists a rather astonishing correspondence between the 
number 21, statistics, the distributed ledger technology (DLT) blockchain, and the casino mentality 
that is often affiliated with the (investment) banking system that was presumably scorned by Satoshi 
Nakamoto considering the message he embedded into the genesis block [177].

; for the case 

Even more, if we “left-shift” 21 in the binary space, we arrive at the number 
, which was 
Satoshi Nakamoto’s original pick for the first coinbase transaction 
. This number, at least 
for a math-driven mind, associates with a (simple) “magic cube” [1062, 1063]; all its lines parallel to 
the faces, and all four triagonals, sum up to 
, the formula results 
in 42. The potential relevance of this peculiar number to the topic of this article will be outlined in a 
3
later section. 
Geometrically, a cube can evidently be interpreted (again) as a block. As stated in a personal email 
[355], Satoshi Nakamoto originally considered setting a finite supply 
 (1) of 42 million BTC, but 
this “seemed high”, so he halved it. Note that, as already stated above, this context also highlights a 
contradiction, or another variation of the interpretation, to a secondary source [355], stating that the 
21 million BTC limit

(1) was pegged to the M1 global money supply measured in USD [1028].

By investigating Bitcoin parameters like the total supply of 21 million BTC, i.e.,

Hence, by interpreting 21 (and 42) as standing for “block” denoted by the symbol ■, and the many 
zeros as a chain-link (technically speaking, the inclusion of the previous block hash into the next block) 
by ○, we may, again, “depict” the number 
of smallest subunits of Bitcoin, as a block ■ chain ○○○○○…○○.

Writing Systems 

Such  (surely  notional)  symbolic  interpretations  may  relate  to  the  Japanese  writing  systems  [1065] 
composed  of  the  syllabic  [1066]  kana  [1067]  /  Hiragana  [1068],  and  the  logographic  [1069]  kanji 
[1070], which are logograms [1069] adopted from Chinese characters [1071]. Amongst their important 
types are pictograms [1072], which are highly stylized and simplified pictures of material objects, like 
人 for person, or 木 for tree / wood, and ideograms [1073], that attempt to visualize abstract concepts, 
such as 上 'up' and 下 'down'. (In Japanese, Satoshi Nakamoto is represented by サトシ・ナカモト 
[1074].)  Hence,  assuming  that  he  showed  signs  of  a  cultural  affinity  to  Japan,  Satoshi  Nakamoto 
probably knew at least the basics principles of kanji [1070], and possibly tried to introduce some (fun) 
symbolism not the fabric of Bitcoin. 
The methods  for  deciphering  his  (potential) messages  have  similarity to translating the writings of 
(temporarily)  forgotten,  ancient  cultures,  such  as  the  Egyptian  hieroglyphs  [1075]  which  were 
eventually decoded by the help of the famed Rosetta Stone [1076], or the manifold, often still not, or 
only  fractionally  understood,  Mesoamerican  writing  systems  [1077-1079],  some  of  them  featuring 
pictorial elements similar to the above case of “blockchain”.

21 (Film) 

On 28 March 2008, i.e., presumably during a decisive phase for Satoshi Nakamoto in creating Bitcoin, 
the Columbia Pictures heist drama film “21” was released [731]. This movie, as well as others [1080], 
are based on the book “Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took 
Vegas  for  Millions”  [1081].  Allegedly  spiced  with  some  dramatic  exaggerations,  this  Hollywood 
production  describes  the  story  the  MIT  Blackjack  Team  [1008,  1082],  which  was  believed  to  be 
founded around 1980. In the context of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, the following snippets might 
be of interest: MIT [414], Harvard [421], Las Vegas, financial (tuition) problems, scholarships, casinos, 
gambling, banking games, and Blackjack [1002], where the number 21 is of pivotal importance. 

The movie also features the so-called “Monty Hall Problem” [886], which is a brain teaser, in the form 
of  a  probability  puzzle,  loosely  based  on  the  American  television  game  show  “Let's  Make  a  Deal” 
[1083], and named after its original host [1084]. The underlying mathematical problem was originally 
posed (and solved) in a 1975 letter [1085], and an article [1086] submitted to the American Statistician 
[1087].  
Born in 1941, the author Steve Selvin [1088] is a professor emeritus of biostatistics at the University 
of California, Berkeley [412] in the San Francisco Bay Area [675], which is known as the birthplace and 
hotspot of the cypherpunk [165, 166] movement in the early 1990s. Note that these articles have been 
published in 1975 [876], i.e., the same year Satoshi Nakamoto claims to have been born on his P2P 
Foundation profile [861]. 

In  the  aftermath  of  its  box  office  success,  a  racial  “whitewashing”  controversy  emerged  over  the 
decision to star the majority of the characters by white [1089] (“Caucasian” [1090]) Americans, even 
though the main players in the book template were Asian-Americans [1091]; its only actor from this 
minority had one-note designations as the squad's kleptomaniac and a slot-playing loser. Moreover, 
intra-Asian  conflicts  arose  as  one  (former)  Chinese-American  [1092]  member  of  the  MIT  Blackjack 
team [1008] uttered "I would have been a lot more insulted if they had chosen someone who was 
Japanese [454] or Korean [1093], just to have an Asian playing me." 
A Beautiful Mind (Film) 

As  it  most  likely  attracted  a  very  similar  audience,  it  is  also  noteworthy  to  look  the  Universal  / 
Dreamworks movie “A Beautiful Mind that started screening (in US cinemas) on 21/12/2001 (note the 

?) [1094]. It is a 
exclusive composition of the date by the numbers 0,1,2,21, and 2001 
Hollywood adapted  biopic  of  John  Nash  [90] (1928–2015), an  American mathematician who made 
fundamental contributions to game theory [1095], which evidently plays a major role in Bitcoin. John 
Nash’s  work  shed  light  onto  the  factors  that  govern  chance  and  decision-making  inside  complex 
systems found in everyday life. 

 2001

In  1994,  Nash  was  co-awarded  the  Nobel  (Memorial)  Prize  in  Economic  Sciences  [1096]  "for  their 
pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games" [1097], and the prestigious 
Abel Prize [1098] in 2015. In 1959, Nash began showing clear signs of mental illness, and spent several 
years at psychiatric hospitals being treated for schizophrenia [1011]. After 1970, his condition slowly 
improved, allowing him to return to academic work by the mid-1980s. The case of John Nash may 
exhibit some (partial) overlap with Satoshi Nakamoto, e.g., around the buzz words genius [994], game 
theory [1095], encryption (ECC [1056]), mental disorder [1009], MIT [414], and Princeton [723]. 
Music Album 

“Twenty One” [418] is the second studio album by the English indie rock band Mystery Jets [419]. It 
was released in the UK on 24 March 2008, i.e., about half a year prior to the publication of the Bitcoin 
whitepaper [175]; it is explain [734]: “Twenty One is the perfect name for this album on more than 
one level. Identities are still being shaped during the first half of most people’s 20s.” Protecting his 
“identity” evidently also paramount for the staging the “mystery” of Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Note that the “21” [1099] by the British artist Adele [1100] was world's best-selling album of the year 
for  both  2011  and  2012,  but  obviously  released  after  the  start  of  Bitcoin.  The  title  refers  to  her 
(approximate) age at the time of composing and recording, so most likely no connection to Bitcoin’s 
choices for 21.

Due to the role of the binary operators that occurred already in the context of Bitcoin parameters for 
doubling and halving, we explore “left-shifting”, i.e., doubling 21, to obtain 
. There are a 
couple of intriguing correlations between Bitcoin and this number; the “Magic Cube” [1062, 1063] was 
already mentioned above in the context of geometries. It can be found in his  emails with an early 
adopter [355] that the number 21 emerged from halving Satoshi Nakamoto’s initial pitch of 42 million 
total supply 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 

42 = 2 × 21

 (1) of BTC.  

At  least  in  “nerdy”  academic  and  techie  circles  around  mathematicians,  physicists,  or  computer 
scientists, 42 is known as the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything” 
[1101]; this absurdly simple number to a complex philosophical question is calculated after 7.5 million 
years  by  the  humanoid  supercomputer  “Deep  Thought”  [1102]  in  “The  Hitchhiker's  Guide  to  the 
Galaxy” [1103]; this science-fiction comedy franchise was created by Douglas Adams [1104], who died 
in  2001  (  2001?).  Originally  a  1978  radio  broadcast  on  BBC  Radio  4,  it  was  later  adapted  to  other 
formats, including stage shows, novels, comic books, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 text-based computer 
game, and a 2005 feature film [1103]. 
Level 42  

The same “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything” [1101-1103] also 
inspired the name of the English jazz-funk band “Level 42” [1105]. Formed on the Isle of Wight [1106] 
in 1979, the band disbanded in 1994, and reformed in 2001; they had a number of UK and worldwide 
hits during the 1980s and 1990s. One of Level 42’s legendary songs is “Running in the Family” [1107] 
from their homonymous 1987-album [1108]. 

This  circumstance  (weakly)  implies  that  Bitcoin  might  have  been  developed  by  a  multigeneration 
group of “relatives” (in blood or mind); such a peculiar multi-author constellation would explain some 

conundrums regarding locations, time zones, spelling, typesetting, competences and historical em-
bedding.  Furthermore,  strong  family  bonds  offer  enhanced  cohesion  for  robust  and  sustained 
collusion compared to a team of fairly independent players which are merely forged by complemen-
tary competences and joined interests. But this aspect is very speculative. 
Coldplay Song 

"42" [735] is a song by the British rock band Coldplay [737] (released on 12 June 2008); it is called "42" 
after the favorite number of (some of) its composers [736]. Its lyrics go: 

Those who are dead are not dead 
They are just living in my head 
And since I fell for that spell 

I am living there as well, oh 
Time is so short 

And I'm sure 
There must be something more 

Whether this poetry was Satoshi Nakamoto’s mind cannot be verified. 
42 Laws of Cricket 

The beginnings of the of the sport of cricket [1109] date back to the beginning in the late 16th century 
in south-east England. Its rules are specified in a code called “The Laws of Cricket” which has a global 
remit [1110]. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The version of the code has been 
owned and maintained by its custodian, the London-based Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) since 1788. 
While  it  has  significantly  moved  on  by  now  as  an  open  international  sport  including  female 
competitions,  cricket  still  strongly  roots  in  a  deep  tradition  of  a  “Gentlemen”  sport, with  an  air  of 
upper class and elite education in its home country of England [1111]. 
Cricket  is  predominantly  popular  in  the  United  Kingdom  [599,  1111,  1112],  Australia  [457],  South 
Africa [1113], New Zealand [1114], Ireland [1115], India [452], Pakistan [1116], Sri Lanka [1117], West 
Indies  [1118],  Bangladesh  [1119],  Namibia  [1120],  and  Zimbabwe  [1121].  These  countries  are  /  or 
were, in some form, affiliated with the former British Empire [1122] and the Commonwealth [565], 
where English, with a preference for British spelling [563], is either the native language, or acts as a 
(quasi) lingua franca [1123]. 
Texas 42 

There is also a trick-taking domino game known as Texas 42 [1124]. It is played with a standard set of 
double six dominoes. 42 is often referred to as the "national game of Texas", where it was designated 
the official “State Domino Game”. 

Jackie Robinson 

The number 42 is tightly affiliated with the legendary baseball player Jackie Robinson (1919 – 1972) 
[1125], the first black athlete to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) during the modern era. Robinson 
played for the Brooklyn Dodgers [1126]. Since 1977, his famous jersey number 42 has been retired by 
his alma mater UCLA, and by all MLB teams since 1977; commencing in 2004, each MLB player wears 
No. 42 on "Jackie Robinson Day” [1127], which is celebrated on April 15 [1128]. 

Robinson’s outstanding role for sports and society is underpinned by the 2013 (i.e., after the 2008-
release of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]) American biographical film “42” [1129]. His story may give 
cues to racial discrimination, for instance, felt by Satoshi Nakamoto as member of a (possibly Japa-
nese-American  [1130]) minority,  and  to  locations  like  New  York  (Brooklyn)  and  Los  Angeles  (UCLA 
[1131]), the Dodgers this franchise was much controversially, moved to Los Angeles in 1957 [1126, 
1132]. This metropolitan area also was where the strong “Satoshi Nakamoto candidate” Hal Finney 

[70,  299,  300,  1058,  1133],  and  the  Japanese-American  [1130]  “Dorian  Nakamoto”  [1134],  who, 
presumably by sheer coincidence, shares the last (and middle) name with Satoshi Nakamoto [7, 371], 
resided at the time of the release of Bitcoin. 
Computer Science School 

As a direct reference to this science-fiction franchise, the private, non-profit and tuition-free computer 
science school “42” was opened in 2013 [1135], i.e., post-launch of Bitcoin. It was created and funded 
by  a  French  billionaire  [1136]  with  several  businesses  in  the  telecommunications  and  technology 
industry. This unconventional name was an explicit reference to “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” 
[1103]. 
Science Trivia 
Geography 
The  possible  meaning  of  the  numbers  21  and  42  might  also  be  scrutinized  from  a  geographical 
perspective. Yet, neither the 21st nor 42nd meridians east or west provided any locations that related 
to Bitcoin, nor did their corresponding latitudes on the Southern hemisphere. In the North, the 21st 
latitude  [1137]  crosses  Hawaii,  and  the  42nd  parallel  [1138] Massachusetts  [1139]  (Boston  [1140]), 
Connecticut [1141], New York (state) [1142], and Illinois [930] (Chicago [1143]) – nothing super com-
pelling overall, with the potential exception of Massachusetts hosting MIT [414] and Harvard [421], as 
related  to  the  film  “21”  [731],  and  the  University of  Illinois  Chicago  [122,  720],  and  the  New  York 
University [750, 1144] and state [1142] related to a Satoshi Nakamoto candidate [122]. At the 42nd 
parallel, the rotational speed of the earth approximately matches the speed of sound. 
Biology 

As one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans [1145], chromosome 21 is both the smallest human 
autosome and chromosome. Most people have two copies, while those with three copies of chromo-
some 21 have Down syndrome [1146], also called "trisomy 21". Chromosome 21 is associated with 
diseases,  disorders  and  conditions,  such  as  cancers,  intellectual  disability,  or  early  onset  familial 
Alzheimer's disease. A likely connection of chromosome 21 to Satoshi Nakamoto could not be recog-
nized. 

Sorting Circumstantial Evidence 
Numbers and Numeral Systems 
This section groups the pointers derived for various numbers in the context of Bitcoin. Note again that 
the interpretations are to be taken with a grain of salt, and only those that are surfacing in various 
reasonable, and tightly linked scenarios, might actually have been intentionally deposited by Satoshi 
Nakamoto; even if this was the case, the probably do not reveal his name tag and whereabouts, but 
would rather reflect his penchant for puns, or even red herrings [829]. 
21 

The most striking pointers gather around the number 21, which occurs in the rather free Bitcoin design 
parameters: the total BTC supply capped to 
 (1) each halving 
 blocks. Reportedly [353], this quantity, as ex-
period 
pressed in the  smallest  BTC  unit  (token)  of Sats, may have been derived  from the 2008 global  M1 
money supply, as expressed in USD cents.

On top of the this rather weak, anecdotal correlation, copious other contexts indicate that the choice

after his 6-day [773] mining gap to the genesis block [177, 302]. As a reference to “block” – possibly 
the most frequent, non-trivial word in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], 21 also corresponds to the sum 
over the faces of a dice, which geometrically resembles a cube or block. When expressing the supply 
limit 
 in the decimal space, the series of 0s cer-
tainly looks like a chain, thus potentially depicting a blockchain. 
Bitcoin was also launched in the 21st century, when his potential chess idol Bobby Fischer [555], who 
conceived the famous “21-move brilliancy” [558], passed away (on 17 January 2008). Several films 
[1147], music albums[1148], and songs [1149] were themed 21 (or Twenty One).

In March of 2008 [522], the film “21” [731, 1082], and the album “Twenty One” by the Mystery(!) Jets

which had a shop in Tokyo [953], and the “Twenty-One Demands” [1151] made during the World War 
I [1152] by the Empire of Japan [454] to the government of the Republic of China [453].

The decimal number 21 yields an alternating “I0I0I” in the binary space, which might be deemed as 
the elements (0) and links (I) constituting a (block-)chain. The 21 de composes into the digits 2 and 1 
of the base-2 system, which has the neutral element 0, and right- and left-shifting bits implementing 
division by 2 (i.e.,

Even  more,  the  42  constitites  the  “Answer  to  the  Ultimate  Question  of  Life,  the  Universe,  and 
Everything” [1101] as calculated and checked by the supercomputer “Deep Thought” [1102] according 
to the “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” [1153], an entertaining sci-fi comedy that is very popular 
amongst techies. Even the name of the British band “Level 42” [1105], and a French computer science 
school [1135] (established post 2008) were inspired by this multi-layered figure. 

The 42 is also a sacred number in the historic Laws of Cricket [1110], and the domino game Texas 42 
[1124,  1129].  Moreover,  42  is  associated  with  the  jersey  number  of  the  famous  baseballer  Jackie 
Robinson [1125, 1129], who broke the race boundaries in professional sport; the number 42 is retired 
to all Major League Baseball [1154] franchises, and all players wear the number 42 once per season 
on “Jackie Robinson day” [1127] (April 15 [1128]). The Northern latitude of 42 [1125] cuts through the 

US federal states, such as Massachusetts [414, 421, 1008, 1138], New York [122, 1142, 1155], and 
Illinois [122, 720, 930], which all pop up various parts of this article. 

While the occurrence of the number 42 is less prominent than 21 in the final version of the Bitcoin 
implementation, the sheer fact that a supply of 42 million was Satoshi Nakamoto’s initial choice for 
the total supply BTC [355] highlights that this number was definitely on Satoshi Nakamoto’s radar. 
Therefore, the numerous associations brought forward in this work on 42 ought to be considered for 
drafting his mindset. 
Pseudonym 
The choice of his pseudonym and the nationality in his (mock) birth certificate clearly articulate Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s  anchoring  to  Japan  [454].  While  this  attribution  is,  most  likely,  a  decoy,  his  particular 
choice of a rather common Japanese name without reference to a celebrity (discarding “Satoshi Sugi-
yama” [812-814], and “Tominaga Nakamoto” [96, 1156, 1157]), likely teaches that Satoshi Nakamoto 
wanted to convey a message. He might have been inspired by his connection to the Sakura House 
[946, 947], a popular residence for foreigners in Tokyo, the nearby Nakano district [949] and Nakano-
sakaue station [948], and the “Nakano Sakaue gang” [118]. 
The choice his first name [809] is often translated as “intelligent history”, possibly indicating a stint, 
e.g.,  as  employee  or  contractor,  in  a  national  intelligence  agency,  or  a  corporate  enterprise  in  the 
context of cryptography and cybersecurity. The syllables Naka- [833] and -moto [834] are widespread 
in Japanese last names, also in the academic and corporate cryptographer community [500-504, 650, 
688, 695-699], some of them are even similar to “Nakamoto”. The entirety of his pseudonym might 
be creatively interpreted as “a genius focused on a project”, or “the wise one of Chinese currency” in 
Chinese. The initials, in their Japanese ordering NS, were even highlighted by Satoshi Nakamoto in an 
email on 12/01/2009 [1057] to Hal Finney [70], one of the earliest Bitcoin adopters [299, 300, 815, 
1058]. 
Locations 
Pinning Satoshi Nakamoto to a fixed location has so far proven to be extremely difficult. While his self-
defined pseudonym and birth certificate point to Japan [454], few other evidence advocates Japanese 
nationality. Instead, a chain of evidence [118, 946-949, 1158, 1159], mainly gained from the similarity 
of (bits of) his name to various places in Tokyo [760, 946, 947] [118, 948, 949], and the registration of 
the privacy-focused email domains [252-256], signals that the alias Satoshi Nakamoto was selected as 
part of a well-orchestrated endeavor to conceal his true identity and whereabouts; yet, they might 
indicate that he might have had a spell of some duration in Tokyo, and an attraction to (facets of) the 
Japanese culture, in advance of creating Bitcoin.  
However, time zone analysis of his postings after the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper reveals some 
stays across various zones in the continental USA, which is supported by the role places like California 
with the greater Los Angeles [926, 1131, 1132] and the Bay Area [675] / Silicon Valley, the state of 
Massachusetts with the Boston area [414, 421], and Great Britain [599] / The Commonwealth [565] / 
Europe [281], which is further supported by Satoshi Nakamoto’s (occasional) spelling preference, and 
the citation of the UK print edition of the London-based “The Times” [303, 741, 747] newspaper in 
Bitcoin’s 2009-genesis block [176, 177]. The second citation (2) [612, 628] of the Bitcoin whitepaper 
[175], and the association of the postings of X [34] that were traced back to Dutch [400] IP addresses 
[174] suggest some liaison with the Benelux [401] countries. 
Sport & Games 
The  various  contexts  disclosed  some  relevance  of  strategic  games  that  are  known  to  appeal  to 
mathematically highly gifted “brainiacs” [1160], like Blackjack [1002, 1003], the Monty-Hall problem 
[886,  1083,  1084],  or  chess  [555,  558].  In  addition,  connections  to  the  bat-and-ball  games  [1161] 

Baseball  [1125]  and  Cricket  [1109,  1110]  are  shown  up,  which  enjoy  particular  (but  not  exclusive) 
popularity in Anglo-America [617, 1162, 1163], Great Britain [599], many former colonies and impact 
zones of the British Empire [1122], respectively. 
Ethnicity 
The  evidence  collected  so  far  also  points  at  minority  issues,  such  as  the  whitewashing  of  Asian-
Americans in the cast of the 2008-movie “21” [731], and the racial discrimination as epitomized by the 
case  of  the  African-American  baseball  legend  Jackie  Robinson  [1125,  1129]  and  his  iconic  jersey 
number 42 [1127]. The author would regard this evidence, without additional pointers, as weak. 
Exposure to Intelligence Organizations 
As a high-caliber cryptography expert, Satoshi Nakamoto was certainly also well aware of legal issues 
around cryptography, like the perpetually smoldering conflict between freedom-of-speech [527] for 
citizens on the one side, and crime-prevention, and national security interests on the other. Profes-
sionals  in  this  highly  demanding  field  are  eagerly  coveted  by  departments  in  federal  three-letter 
agencies [460, 461, 544, 554, 842-849, 851, 852], as well as the corporate (ICT [1164]) sector. It is also 
not  uncommon  that  accomplished  cryptographers  in  academia  are  approached  by  intelligence 
institutions.  

Satoshi Nakamoto’s unique portfolio of interdisciplinary skills might root from a designated training in 
such organizations, who would have committed him to long-term confidentiality on information, and 
refrained  him  from  utilizing  intelligence  techniques  acquired  through  them  in  external,  or  post-
departure projects. Cases like the WikiLeaks [359, 538-541, 1165] disclosures, Silk Road [119, 543] and 
the regulatory watchdog SEC [138, 534, 1166] challenging to the legitimacy of issuing cryptocurrencies 
before, during his brief online life, and even after his unexpected exit from the landscape of Bitcoin 
might have distinctly sharpened his very pronounced sensitivity for public exposure of himself, and his 
electronic cash masterpiece. 
Biographical Cues 
Competences and Work Ethic 
Without  doubt,  Satoshi  Nakamoto,  especially  if  assuming  an  individual  actor,  must  cover  an 
extraordinarily broad spectrum  of techno-scientific and economical competences. His  amazing C++ 
[975]  programming  skills  are  supplemented  by  a  deeper  understanding  of  distributed  computing 
[985], peer-to-peer (P2P) [986], privacy technologies [404, 407-409, 689, 1167], operating systems 
[1168], mathematics [1169], probability theory, game theory [1095], the money [898], banks [1170], 
law  [1171],  current  affairs  [121, 359,  362,  520,  538,  738, 741, 747],  federal  (intelligence)  agencies 
[554], and (likely) history [527, 710, 895, 1172, 1173]. Satoshi Nakamoto’s unusually large spectrum 
and composition of relevant knowledge was paired with his outstanding ingenuity, creativity, resolve, 
and dedication, probably rooting in a very pronounced libertarian [378] streak in his personal ideology. 

Such staunch determination may have grown out of a sympathy, if not a substantial immersion in the 
cypherpunk movement, and an irreconcilable personal aversion towards the legacy banking system; 
this characteristic would be untypical for a person much younger than – say – the age of 25-30, and 
would  thus  never  have  been  personally  exposed,  and  significantly  delusioned  by  real-world  pro-
fessional  environments  and  financial  matters.  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  work  on  Bitcoin  may  well  have 
commenced around August 2007 with the forerunners of the upcoming global financial crisis [521], 
which has motivated  him to  crack,  for the first time, the “double-spending” problem, and thereby 
achieving the much sought-after goal of “ultrasound digital money”. 
The  tremendous  intellectual  and  creative  effort  of  creating  Bitcoin  certainly  involved  unstinted 
commitment to long daily working hours without (project-related) technical or social communication 
to avoid compromising the veil over his identity; managing such a rather extreme social and psycho-

logical situation might imply a genius [994] with some (possibly mild) level of mental condition [999, 
1009]. Such an extravagant, exceptionally talented individual must definitely have left highly visible 
marks along his private life, as well as his educational and professional career. 
Education & Career 

With all this, Satoshi Nakamoto must still have had funds to sustain his everyday life and pay bills. 
Given his widely assumed, distinct despise for the banking establishment, it is unlikely that he was 
coming from a wealthy background in 2007/2008 that let him live from inherited assets and passive 
income. While there are examples of geniuses living a purposely austere lifestyle, e.g., by still living at 
advanced age and deliberately jobless with their parents [1024], such extreme modesty seems to clash 
with Satoshi Nakamoto’s evident interest in monetary systems [898]. 

The previously used analysis of the work hours (on Bitcoin) and time zones [231] when he submitted 
postings  and  committed  to  the  code  repository  in  2009/2010  [172,  917]  indicates some  interstate 
travel in the USA [617] or Canada [427, 1163], and some stints in the UK [599] / Europe [281], the 
latter is also corroborated by the preferred date format DD/MM/YYYY [913], and his (sporadic) British 
spelling and idioms [563]. Overall, it is likely that Satoshi Nakamoto was intercontinentally commuting 
between the North [1174] / Anglo [1162] America and Europe [281]. 

His  Bitcoin-related  activity  pattern  peaked  in  February,  followed  by  a  valley  until  resuming  again 
towards the summer, resuming around June. Such monthly schedules may suggest an alignment with 
typical college schedules, for instance, as a postgraduate student, postdoc, or as a member of aca-
demic staff; an experience in scientific publication is further backed by his use of (old-style) double-
spacing after the period at the end of sentences (in ASCII-format [575] postings), e.g., in his original 
announcements  (and  associated  threads)  of  the  Bitcoin  whitepaper  themed  “Bitcoin  P2P  e-cash 
paper” on 31/10/2008 [282], and the public release of the Bitcoin source code on 08/01/2009 [307] 
on the cryptography mailing list [283]. 

However, other facts, like the unusual brevity and composition of references in his Bitcoin whitepaper 
[175], or his first name meaning  “intelligent history”,  direct towards a  designated  training and job 
experience in a three-letter secret service agency [460, 461, 544, 554, 842-849, 851, 852], which must 
have  strictly  obliged  him  towards  high  levels  of  long-term  secrecy  on  classified  information  and 
methods acquired. This assumption was shared by insiders that anonymously advised (parts of) this 
work. 

A personal connection to the 2008-film “21” taking place within East-Coast [722] elite-college environ-
ments (MIT [414], Harvard [421]) also fits well into this framework. The activity peak at Saturdays / 
end-of-the-week revealed that in this work might not specifically underpin his academic embedding, 
as it is rather common in many professional environments, like external consultants who often work 
from their homebase on Fridays.  
Genius 

The invention of Bitcoin required deep interest and expert skills in an unusual combination of multi-
disciplinary  skills  extending  substantially  beyond  cryptography  and  programming.  In  particular  the 
bibliography in the Bitcoin whitepaper indicates that Satoshi Nakamoto may not have been a long-
term core member of the cypherpunk and electronic cash community, supporting the characteristics 
of a superfast learning, highly autodidactic genius. 
This document produced compounding evidence that, in addition to practical or logical explanations, 
Satoshi Nakamoto may have (deliberately) encoded a mixture of information and puns into a set of 
“free” variables, like select Bitcoin parameters, certain dates, and his alias. It is important to note that 
these messages do not (directly) interfere with his resolve for obfuscating his identity and locations; 

instead, these witty riddles reflect the signature of a genius who cannot resist putting his mind to work 
to produce jokes that, at least instantaneously, only resonate with similarly endowed superbrains. 

In a more creative  interpretation,  these messages tell about a genius who, while being capable of 
doing amazing things, also has a normal life, with plenty of personal frustrations, and possibly even 
suffering from social isolation, minority discrimination, and a (mild) form of mental disorder [1009], 
which has been reported for many other famous inventors and scientists. 

Biography and Psychogram – An Attempt 
After a deep dive the substantial amount of existing research, and a set of new circumstantial evidence 
exposed in this work, it exudes that Satoshi Nakamoto used his undoubted ingenuity, multidisciplinary 
competences, and unstinted resolve to pull off Bitcoin in 2008, and, likewise, to methodologically, and 
(so far) successfully, obscure his identity and whereabouts, i.e., for far more than a decade ago by 
now. The author agrees with the vast majority that the Bitcoin community that we should be very 
grateful  to  Satoshi  Nakamoto  for  his  priceless  gift  of  developing  the  first  practically  functional, 
decentralized and globally inclusive cryptocurrency based on a public, and distributed ledger to the 
world. 

Yet, from a history of science and technology perspective, as well as to anticipate and gauge possible 
fallout  for  the  future  of  Bitcoin,  it  is  worthwhile  elucidating  the  story,  character,  motivation,  and 
mentality of its enigmatic inventor. Satoshi Nakamoto’s pivotal masterwork was formed under the 
impact of happenings in the past prior to, and at the time of launching the whitepaper in 2008. Just 
only a few years after its birth, Bitcoin has swiftly turned into a seminal disruptor of the 21st-century 
technology, and has laid the groundwork for adding a native value layer to the present Web2.0 [1175].  

Despite that the creation of Bitcoin is undoubtedly not a felony [1176] at all, the search for Satoshi 
Nakamoto resembles offender profiling [1177] in a cold case [32], e.g., the infamous “Jack the Ripper” 
[1178],  and  others  [181,  1179,  1180]  in  the  recent  century;  such  criminal  investigation  involves 
drafting a person's mental, emotional, and personality characteristics based on things done or traces 
left.  Other  parallels  to  the  methodology  pursued  here  are  found  in  unraveling historical  mysteries 
[179, 202, 203, 205-207], in reconstructing forgotten techniques[175][176][177, 178][179-188][198-
201], and in deciphering the meaning of ancient writings left by ceased cultures [1075, 1077-1079]. 
Accordingly, the quest for Satoshi Nakamoto is largely anchored in an ever-evolving forensic collection 
of circumstantial evidence, which is, unavoidably, prone to notorious tunnel vision [1181], subjective 
conclusions, and blatant overinterpretations. Still, by filling the voids with the author’s hunch, a best 
attempt  is  implemented  on  how  the  available  pieces  of  the  unavoidably  incomplete  puzzle  might 
optimally assemble. 

Note that most likely, the real Satoshi Nakamoto, when put on the spot, would adamantly deny any 
interest or involvement in cryptocurrencies, possibly refusing any comments, and declining interviews. 
He would presumably even be happy if other nominations and self-claims were fielded, thus distrac-
ting investigators, and defocussing public attention. 
General Profile 
The author would consider Satoshi Nakamoto as a strongly ideals-driven, legally well versed, inter-
gifted,  multi-talented, 
continentally  engaged,  endurably 
interdisciplinary  polymath  [884],  and  productive  modern-age  cryptographer  [1182]  who  is  very 
confident in applying his highly advanced, hands-on (C++ [975]) coding skills; the still enduring success 
of  shielding  his  real-world  identity  reveals  a  cunningly  orchestrated,  and  wide-ranging  expertise  in 
online  privacy  technology  [404-410]  enabled  by  a  comprehensive,  long-term  sustainable  strategy, 
enforced  by  diligent,  highly  disciplined,  and  consistent  execution.  From  what  is  known,  Satoshi 

closemouthed,  extraordinarily 

50 ± 5

Nakamoto never met in person, at least not under his pseudonym, or left any form of analog traces, 
such as handwriting, voice, video or face-to-face talks with other members of the Bitcoin community, 
a practice that no uncommon in online interest groups.  
He is probably a male individual who was raised, or has spent formative years, in a British cultural 
background. He was physically located in early 2009 where the paper version of the London-based 
“The Times” was available, e.g., the UK, or metropolitan areas in Europe, like Brussels in Belgium. The 
peak hours of his post-whitepaper postings suggest that he either ran Bitcoin as an afterwork hobby, 
or mostly resided in or near the Eastern-US time zone. 

Satoshi Nakamoto very likely entertained some solid link into the Benelux cryptographer powerhouse 
around Leuven, and probably fostered a close relation to an elder person born well before 1940, e.g., 
a family member, friend or tutor, with a profound passion for math. He displayed a certain familiarity, 
or even fondness of (elements of) the Japanese culture, and the choice of his pseudonym was possibly 
inspired,  and  assembled,  by  similar-sounding  names  of  Japanese  cryptographers.  The  ingenious 
architect of Bitcoin himself most likely belongs to the (extended) Generation X [713], or was a (second-
half) “baby boomer” [1183]; so he might have been not much younger than 
 years of age, i.e., 
not a “Millennial” [1184], and not much older than 
 in the later 2000s, i.e., approximately born 
30 ± 5
in the mid-1950s to 1980 bracket.  

Satoshi Nakamoto must have had excellent formal or autodidactic, fast-tracked and award-decorated 
education in a rather extraordinary portfolio of disciplines, plus a creative mind for thinking outside 
the box, and an unsettled resolve for implementation. His CV must be unusual, a career of an early 
high achiever boasting outstanding accomplishments, and inexplicable discontinuities. This attributes 
perfectly converged for pulling off Bitcoin in 2007/2008, and fading out in 2010/2011. 
His interest in “sound money” may well have been accompanied, or sparked, by events around the 
turn of the millennium, such as the start of the Eurozone [1185] in 1999, or the burst of the dot-com 
bubble [1186] in the early 2000s, when Satoshi Nakamoto may have discovered cryptocurrencies as a 
means to implement his libertarian ideals; since then, he might have (possibly anonymously, or via 
another alias) followed, posted and interacted with the cypherpunk or cryptographer scenes, or been 
involved  in,  or  passively  following  the  conception,  development,  discussion,  or  implementation  of 
other electronic cash / micropayment systems [269-271, 608, 611, 619, 1187]. Yet, he might not have 
been a seasoned cypherpunk at the time. 
When writing the Bitcoin whitepaper and early mining, Satoshi Nakamoto ran Microsoft Windows (XP) 
on  comparatively  low-end  hardware,  and,  very  distinctively,  used  the  quite  uncommon  word  pro-
cessor OpenOffice. The format and writing style of his Bitcoin whitepaper also indicates some expo-
sure to academic publishing, either through just regular screening of scientific literature, or by active 
involvement at a rather early stage, like postgrad, postdoc or reader / lecturer level, but not carrying 
the signature of an internationally reputed, highly accomplished senior faculty member. 

Satoshi Nakamoto’s texts featured rather impeccable, native-level English with a notable mixture of 
American [571] and British English [563] spelling and expressions, which would be very uncommon for 
people culturally firmly anchored to the USA or UK, respectively. This linguistic signature might either 
indicate assimilation through a longer-term stay in an environment where the alternative version is 
dominant, e.g., a person from regions impacted by both spellings, e.g., Canada [910] or other (present 
or  former)  Commonwealth  [564]  countries.  Another  option  would  be  that  English  was  not  Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s mother tongue, but he perfected his skills acquired in school while exposed to diverse 
private, academic or professional communities, or through original language services, e.g., in journals, 
books, movies and interactive online media. 

Another conspicuous feature in Satoshi Nakamoto’s writing (in his ASCII text postings) is his pedantic 
double-spacing  after  a  full  stop  at  the  end  of  sentences  [285].  This  custom  has  been  abandoned 

decades ago, especially when mechanical typewriters were increasingly substituted by mechatronic 
systems, and  eventually computers with modern text processors and high-resolution printers.  This 
habit would thus be characteristic for a Baby Boomer [1183] who still learnt typing on a classical ma-
chine, e.g., in the 1980s. Overall, the evidence from his writings, i.e., blending English language vari-
ants and the two spaces before a full stop, turns out to be inconsistent, and it may well surmised that 
embodied a clever maneuver in his sophisticated, multi-level strategy for camouflaging his identity. 

Satoshi  Nakamoto  may  have  had  some  disappointing  experiences,  such  as  bullying  by  peers  or 
teachers as a prodigy child, for instance, as a (Commonwealth [565]) expatriate, or pertaining to an 
ethnic minority, e.g., as a Japanese American [1130]. Possibly treated as a maverick geek, he might 
have been ridiculed by envious fellow students who were sent by their wealthy family to elite colleges, 
and showed off with prestigious cars and high-fly lifestyle, while he was socially somewhat isolated, 
and just getting along on a rather tight scholarship budget. 

Satoshi Nakamoto might  have  found,  early on, consolation in  computer  and internet technologies, 
strategy (banking or board) games like Blackjack, Poker or Chess, following idols with similar mental 
and  social  issues  accompanying  their  ingenuity,  like  the  extravagant  world  chess  champion  Bobby 
Fischer [555], or the game theorist John Nash [90, 1094], whom he could intellectually and emotionally 
emphasize with. 

His exuberant motivation for working extended periods with immense emotional commitment on a 
cryptocurrency  must  have  been  rooted  from  a  deep  frustration,  e.g.,  with  the  traditional  banking 
system, paired with a distinct libertarian attitude, as prevalent throughout the cypherpunk movement. 
However, possibly due to his age, he might only have discovered, and immersed with this rather niche 
scene, and familiarized with predecessor electronic cash / cryptocurrency attempts at the time when 
he began pondering and working on Bitcoin in the second half of the 2000s. 
Around the year 2006, Satoshi Nakamoto may have had a longer stay in the Tokyo where he enjoyed 
the  local  culture,  and  socialized  with  a  similar-minded  community;  these  circles  may  have  been 
comprised of (possibly including  himself) Japanophiles, digital nomads, free-speech advocates, and 
highly privacy-oriented internet natives, which helped him to systematically cover his identity from an 
early stage, and, in parallel, to decisively enhance his interest in the politico-economically quite radical 
objectives similar to those promoted by the cypherpunk scene. 

Under the influence of this ambient, Satoshi Nakamoto gradually developed an increasing, eventually 
quasi-obsessive  passion  for  electronic  cash  systems  /  cryptocurrencies,  which  offered  a  path  to 
address  severe  issues  he  affiliated  with  the,  at  least from  his  point  of  view,  dysfunctional  banking 
system by leveraging his outstanding intellectual capabilities and exceptional work ethic towards what 
later materialized as Bitcoin. 
Though  the  interplay  of  these  experiences  and  awareness  of  this  own  remarkable  skills,  Satoshi 
Nakamoto  decided  to  devote  himself  to  the  Bitcoin  project  in  the  second  part  of  2007,  when 
forerunners  of  the  upcoming  financial  crisis  already  crystallized.  Considering  his  accelerated 
education,  a  dedicated  training  in  cryptography  or  cybersecurity,  e.g.,  in  academia,  the  corporate 
arena, or a three-letter agency [460, 461, 544, 554, 842-849, 851, 852], Satoshi Nakamoto entered his 
self-chosen solitude within a 1.5-year Bitcoin development tunnel, possibly as an intensive after-work, 
or late-night / weekend pastime. 

During  this  decisive  period,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  was  getting  progressively  motivated  by  the  con-
currently escalating financial crisis [520, 738]; his concerns about free speech that he was familiar with 
from the preceding or emerging cases, such as Phil Zimmermann’s PGP case [1173], Bernstein v. USA 
[527], Napster [531, 532], Megaupload [533], or Wikileaks [359, 360, 362, 538], were even amplified. 

While  online,  he  foremostly  conveyed  the  impression  of  a “tech-head”;  for  the  most  part,  Satoshi 
Nakamoto  remained  very  rational  on  explanations  of  techno-economical  aspects  of Bitcoin,  rather 

than  preemptively  celebrating  his  early-miner’s  opportunity  for  his  future  monetary  fortunes,  and 
economic impact; he also widely desisted from passionately advocating extreme ideological positions, 
e.g., those affiliated with the cypherpunk movement. 
With a fondness for pattern recognition, Satoshi Nakamoto might also have enjoyed multifold overlap 
of his Bitcoin parameters with fun and coincidental interpretations of the number 21 in relation to 
math, geometry, history, politics, media and sports, and the decentralized “chain of blocks” as a key-
stone  of  his  Bitcoin.  Similarly  enjoyable  correlations  also  hold  for  the  number  42,  like  the  “The 
Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” [1103], the “Magic Cube” [1062, 1063], the Laws of Cricket [1109, 
1110], and the legendary baseballer Jackie Robinson [1125, 1127]. 
Around August 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto had most of the Bitcoin package wrapped up; however, not 
having been a seasoned member of the cypherpunk and academic research community, he was some-
what unsure whether he properly accounted for prior art, which was very hard to pinpoint and retrieve 
with the traditional instruments commonplace in scientific publishing; in fact, he eventually left out 
some major work, and listed some rather “odd” citations to the references of the Bitcoin whitepaper, 
to an extent that his document would have likely been returned for major revision after peer review 
by a classical  journal; in  hindsight,  Satoshi Nakamoto might even have been flabbergasted  that  he 
(independently) reinvented major elements of Bitcoin’s various precursor components [485, 616, 676, 
714-716, 1188-1190] and currency systems [262, 268-270, 611, 619, 825, 989, 990, 1187, 1191, 1192] 
that displayed technical or motivational similarity. 

Satoshi Nakamoto seemed to be strong to endure the initial week of silence, and the ensuing, mostly 
critical  and  dismissive  echo  in  the  cryptography  mailing  list  [283]  following  the  publication  of  the 
whitepaper  on  31  October  2008  [279].  After  the  discussion  picked  up,  he  initiated  a  designated 
“bitcoin-list”  [340]  on  10  December  2008  [1193].  While  in  the  final  steps  of  honing  his  work  on 
Bitcoin’s code v0.1 with the help of a few early adopters (like Hal Finney [70] and Ray Dillinger [294]), 
Satoshi Nakamoto came across the now legendary headline on the frontpage of (the UK print issue of) 
“The Times” (of London) [176]; this unique opportunity to express his objectives and dislike of the 
legacy monetary / banking system prompted him to expedite the mining of the Genesis block 0 [177] 
on 03 January 2009 [739], even though he still wanted to perform some polishing before uploading 
the code to a public repository almost a week later. 
Over the next about  two years,  Satoshi Nakamoto interacted at fluctuating intensity with the con-
tinuously growing Bitcoin community. He seemed to have been quite appreciative of inputs, but also 
showed traits of a benevolent dictator; he seldomly merged contributions from others into the code, 
and had notable peaks of his postings and commitment over the course of the years. Overall, Satoshi 
Nakamoto  focused  mostly  on  technical  issues,  and  remained  overwhelmingly  silent  on  ideological 
aspects of Bitcoin occasionally raised by the community. His business or investment attitude towards 
Bitcoin, as well as his desire to assume formal roles, and to wield the power arising from them, appear 
to have ranked at astonishingly low priority. 

While nowadays many hardcore Bitcoiners tend to perceive him akin to a divine entity, the level of 
respect towards Satoshi Nakamoto in these early days in the online fora was occasionally appallingly 
small, and his natural authority even occasionally challenged. Towards the end of 2010, Satoshi Naka-
moto  might  have  gotten  increasingly  alienated  from  the  budding  early-adopter  community, 
discouraged about the  attitude  they  showed towards him, disillusioned about the feasibility of  his 
initial objectives. 

More likely, his rather odd departure might have actually been part of a long-term planned, gradual 
exit that he deliberately chose not to communicate in advance. Consequently, over the course of time, 
he  began  transferring  the  stewardship  of  Bitcoin  development  and  mailing  lists  to  trusted  stake-
holders. At some stage, Satoshi Nakamoto might just have considered his creative part in setting up 

Bitcoin essentially delivered, and after “mission accomplished” was reached, from his perspective, he 
went on to new challenges that his exceptionally gifted mind could play around with and solve. He 
might also have faced issues balancing his personal commitments between Bitcoin and his private life 
and job, which was needed to settle his bills, or to deal with situations in his family.  

Satoshi Nakamoto’s gradual exit from Bitcoin towards end of April 2011 was also spurred by the arrival 
of  Bitcoin  in  mainstream  media,  and  in  particular  through  discussions  about  Bitcoin  adoption  in 
circumventing the financial blockade of Wikileaks [359, 362, 538], and an upcoming meeting with the 
CIA [554, 816], 2022 #7071}. 

He definitely wanted to strictly maintain his own privacy and keep the nascent Bitcoin project out of 
the spotlight of the press, and potential legal prosecution. This hyper-cautious attitude might have 
resulted from professional commitments on strict, and long-term confidentiality he signed with three-
letter agencies or industry; their potential breach might lead to seriously sanctions, even reaching as 
far as longer-term imprisonment; Satoshi Nakamoto was certainly aware of related cases, e.g., from 
peers, colleagues, or via public media outlets.  

After his pseudonym became inactive in the community space, he did still not want to jeopardize his 
brainchild, and felt a deep ethical obligation to desist pushing certain buttons. Satoshi Nakamoto be-
lieved it would be unfair to move the BTC he rather easily and copiously mined in 2009, as a lion share 
of them would be attributed to him. Also, the fear of legal issues, e.g., enforced by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) [534] or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [1194], such as unauthorized 
issuance of Bitcoin as a security, or gigantic obligations in capital gains tax (CGT) [1195], might have 
led to a firm pledge to refrain from touching, or even to burn about 1 million BTC, e.g., by locking up, 
burning, or destructing (the physical medium storing) his private keys. (In principle, the private keys 
might have also been deleted or lost by mistake, but this is unlikely for an extraordinarily computer-
versed cryptographer.) Such potential institutionally  led investigations would have, most  probably, 
also compromised his personally highly valued anonymity. 

Conversion of BTC into fiat money [411] was also impractical before first exchanges emerged in 2010 
[819, 820]; after his departure from the community, cashing out his 2009-BTC assets without leaking 
his  real  name  would  have  been  extremely  difficult,  other  than  through  entering  rather  dubious 
technologies like cryptocurrency tumblers [1196] (also referred to as “mixers”), which were still to 
emerge in the early days of Bitcoin; such legally questionable action might have attracted the attention 
of federal prosecutors, who might have already blacklisted his Bitcoin addresses. A full extermination 
of all evidence, including his online accounts, connecting him to Bitcoin might also have been part of 
Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  advanced  strategy  to  strictly  protect  his  privacy,  and  to  eternally  obscure  the 
origins of his cryptocurrency project. 
Satoshi Nakamoto might still enjoy operating in an unnoticed “God-mode” in the Bitcoin community, 
or even staying involved under his real name, or another mock identity. After all, Satoshi Nakamoto 
just  retired  his  pseudonym,  possibly  with  a  self-imposed  pledge  to  only  resurface  in  emergency 
situations, such as in the resolution of the civil war about Bitcoin XT [1197], or for relieving a name-
alike Japanese-American “Dorian Nakamoto” from unwanted public exposure as the (wrong) person 
behind Bitcoin. 

Satoshi Nakamoto might nowadays be very wealthy, profiting from the Bitcoin he mined in a more 
competitive environment post 2009/2010, and lucrative follow-on businesses. While his focus might 
have shifted to other exciting, possibly even diametrically different projects, e.g., in the large spectrum 
of cryptography, Satoshi Nakamoto still may remain, like any parent, very proud of the breath-taking 
success of his now adolescent masterpiece Bitcoin. In public, Satoshi Nakamoto would surely emanate 
the aura of a genius, but otherwise be a normal human with his repertoire of strengths, weaknesses, 
concerns, flaws and vices in his character. 

Multi-Tier Filtering 
The previous section described a bottom-up approach. Following a top-down perspective pursued in 
this section, the potential cohort of candidates is progressively narrowed [66]. Some filters feature a 
restrictive conditio sine qua non, meaning that it is hard to imagine the real Satoshi Nakamoto would 
not pass them, or have a very convincing excuse why they do not apply. There are also more tolerant 
sieving steps, but their associated criteria are unlikely to hold in their entirety.

There are about 8 billion people living on our planet. But it is reasonable to assume [425, 491] that 
the mastermind of Bitcoin must have been an expert cryptographer pertaining to an elite crowd of 
similar size as the community involved in the annual CRYPTO meetings [429, 456, 492, 494, 589], or 
government and other entities involved in cryptography [460, 461, 544, 554, 842-849, 851, 852]. For 
the sake of a back-of-the envelope calculation, let’s assume about 1,000 researchers (
Only about one quarter of this selection might have had a keen interest in electronic cash / payment 
systems or cryptocurrencies, if considering that projects like Bitcoin are not necessarily received well 
in the traditional academic community of cryptographers, especially at the time (
Of  those,  maybe  half  belonged  to  the  Generation-X [713] or  (younger  range  of  the)  Baby  Boomer 
[1183]  age  group,  have  native-level  fluency  of  mixed  “American-British”  English,  and  a  cultural 
embedding in the USA, Britain, the Commonwealth or Europe ().  
Another filter is the rare combination of Microsoft Windows (XP) on a rather low-performance CPU 
(neither Intel Core i5 series nor AMD processors), OpenOffice rather than TEX [586] / LATEX [587], 
which is very widespread across the scientific community, or, for instance, common WYSIWYG [581] 
editors like Microsoft Word [582, 583], for typesetting. Using Open Office and double-spaces before 
periods (in ASCII texts), might have been part of his cover-up.  
In  addition  to  having  a  libertarian  mindset  and  sophisticated  capabilities  in  cryptography,  online 
privacy, (C++ [975]) programming, and probability theory (8) [557, 719], which might be commonplace 
amongst high-caliber cryptographers, Satoshi Nakamoto also exhibited an unusual portfolio of com-
plementary skills in distributed computing, financial systems / banking / money, economics / game 
theory, law / freedom-of-speech, and history, which further slashes the number of likely candidates 
offering this entire gamut (

Satoshi Nakamoto’s psychogram exhibited an introvert, “techie” streak, occasionally showing flippant 
decision making, possibly also an Asperger-like [1012] syndrome, or other mental condition, perhaps 
flanked by depressive episodes [1198]. Additionally, he must have had the time, determination, and 
financial  prerequisites  between  2007/2008,  and  up  to  2010,  to  deeply  delve  into  the  subject  of 
electronic cash while not necessarily having been a core member of the cypherpunk community. 
He must also have had the emotional persistence and social discipline to keep it for himself throughout 
conception, implementation, and even post departure and “eternity”. So, either the circumstances of 
his job permitted this tremendous time commitment, e.g., in academia, or Satoshi Nakamoto must 
have literally lived like a socially and professionally secluded “crypto-monk” when developing Bitcoin; 
this psychologically stressful situation might rule out that he was in a close (but occasionally fragile) 
personal relationship, or that he was surrounded by an intense family life, at least not at the time of 
concocting Bitcoin (
His Bitcoin whitepaper reveals a genius who displayed dazzling capability for brilliantly explaining the 
technical framework of  Bitcoin  without  much ideological overhead. While extrapolating the  future 
potential of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto assumes a project perspective, rather than boasting about his 
tightly  related  (potential)  own  entrepreneurial  and  financial  success  story.  Satoshi  Nakamoto  is  a 
person with great intellectual achievements, with a propensity to watch his accomplishments taking 
on a life of their own once they are firmly anchored in their community. Yet, while having left Bitcoin,

The  bibliography  of  the  whitepaper  discloses  a  stunning  paucity  of  knowledge  about  historic 
precursors [262, 271, 485, 608] at the time of writing the Bitcoin whitepaper; this may either indicate 
a  lack  of  interest  in  compliance  with  good  academic  practices,  a  disrespect  or  personal  aversion 
against certain pioneers, or a sheer unfamiliarity with the state of the art (
Often overlooked, but critical in the chain of evidence, the arguably most compelling “physical” evi-
dence of Satoshi Nakamoto are represented by the citations (2) [612] and (8) [557] that were only 
available as printed documents at the time of authoring the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. Reference (8) 
points to a 1957 edition of a textbook on probability theory [557, 711, 719], which would have hardly 
been the generic choice of a generation-X [713] or Baby Boomer [1183] cryptographer born after the 
mid-1950s.  
Even  more  intriguing,  the  second  citation  (2)  [612],  which  assumes  a  central  role  in  the  Bitcoin 
whitepaper [175] (Figure 1), was only available as part of the proceedings [628] of a local meeting 
symposium  on  information  theory  in  the  Benelux  [401].  According  to  its  editor  [634],  the  book  of 
proceedings was only available as a in printed form at the time of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], and it 
was  only  distributed  to  the  (registered)  attendees,  and  sent  out  to  select  libraries,  like  the  “Royal 
Library of the Netherlands” [635] in The Hague [636]. 
Satoshi Nakamoto also left a trace of locality as mined he quoted a headline from the frontpage of 
“The Times” (of London) in the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain on 03 January 2009. He probably 
overlooked  that  only  the  print  issue  was  exclusively  available  in  the  UK,  and  most  likely  in  certain 
metropolitan areas in continental Europe, like Brussels as the headquarter of the EU. In the interna-
tional print and online versions of the same article, the title slightly varied. 
The  chances  of  a  non-academic  without  tight  connections  into  the  cryptography  hot  spot  of  the 
Benelux [401], e.g., to the attendees of the 1999 symposium, the organizing WIC [629], or the IEEE 
Benelux Chapter on Information Theory [631], the KU Leuven [77, 430, 506, 643, 645, 677, 692, 693, 
1199], UC Leuven [124, 125, 637], TU Eindhoven [122, 431, 432, 701, 702, 1200], or the Leiden Uni-
versity [113, 434], possibly paired with tight links to the UC Berkeley and Californian cryptographer 
ecosystem [73, 113, 412, 415, 416], IACR [494, 508] organized in the CRYPTO conferences series [456, 
589,  1201],  and  the  cypherpunk  scene  [69-71,  74,  77,  165,  166,  168,  288,  360,  428,  1202],  which 
emanated from the San Francisco Bay Area [675], and its go-to mailing lists (e.g., cryptography [283], 
cypherpunks [167], coderpunks [1203, 1204], Bluesky [1205, 1206]), where digital money was a hot 
topic [266], appear to be negligible. Hence, Satoshi Nakamoto was / is most conceivably part of this 
cross-fertilizing biosphere. Note, however, that the intersection between the academic / traditional 
cryptographer community [1182], at least under their real-world identity, and cypherpunk scene [168] 
was rather scant [74, 77, 428, 721, 1207-1213] (2 
After this collection of rather hard facts, there is a heap of circumstantial evidence, which might be

coincidental on their own, but about half of them might apply to the real Satoshi Nakamoto. There 
are some penchants, namely: Japanese culture (Tokyo [118, 760, 947, 949, 953], Manga [932] / Anime 
[933]),  strategic  games  (e.g.,  Blackjack  [1002,  1008,  1082],  Poker  [1000],  Chess  [556,  558,  1050]),

).

In addition, there Satoshi Nakamoto might have employed his free design parameters (e.g., Bitcoin 
blockchain, pseudonym, date of birth, nationality) to point to various contexts that he cared about, or 
found amusing, e.g.,  political  (gold  ownership in the US [895-897]), political (“chancellor” message 
Bitcoin’s in genesis block [176, 177, 753]), societal (minority issues [1008, 1127]), celebrity geniuses 
(e.g., Bobby Fischer  [555], John Nash [89, 90], Steve Selvin [887], [712]), Sci-Fi (“Hitchhiker” [1101, 
1103], “Star Trek” [904, 905]), music [735-737, 1105, 1107], or sports (e.g., Jacky Robinson [1125], 
Cricket  [1110])  context.  In  addition,  there  are  hints  to  certain,  mostly  US-locations  where  Satoshi 
Nakamoto might have resided or transiently stayed, like the San Francisco Bay Area [675], or Greater

Los Angeles [926, 1131, 1132] in California [493], Chicago [1143], Illinois [720, 930], or New York [750, 
1142]. 

Finally, the real Satoshi Nakamoto must have had very compelling reasons for his, from an external 
perspective,  rather  unglamorous  and  unanticipated  parting  with  the  Bitcoin  community  (at  least 
under his pseudonym), his subsequent online silence, and for desisting to touch his crypto-wealth (so 
far). It can only be guessed that this exceptional behavior is related to voluntary, accidental, or forced 
destruction / loss of private keys / passwords for account access, pure altruism to endow a beneficial 
founding myth, legal or tax issues, family situations, or some medical or mental condition. 

By virtue of  his elaborate, cutting-edge masking of identity, and  by knowing that, most  likely, only 
himself could ultimately resolve the mystery, the real Satoshi Nakamoto would unsurprisingly dismiss 
his  involvement  in  the  creation  of  Bitcoin;  he  might  even  deny  any  past  or  present  interest  in 
cryptocurrencies, and be fully focused on other research or corporate adventures. 
Shortlist of Questions 
For the majority of Bitcoiners, a transaction from early mined BTC ascribed with high certainty to the 
creator of Bitcoin remains the most compelling, if not ultimate proof of his/her/their identity. for. As 
long as this is not demonstrated, a Satoshi Nakamoto claim would hinge upon plausible clarifications 
about key pieces of the conundrums, and the resolution of the (apparent) paradoxes he left behind.  
The preceding sections of this  article brought up a large number of issues that are relevant  to the 
origins of Bitcoin. In the following lists are sorted and prioritized into essential prerequisites Satoshi 
Nakamoto must know, may answer to strengthen support for “Satoshiness”, and more curiosity driven 
questions. 
Hard facts 

1.  How was it possible for you to engrave the headline of The Times UK print edition [176] into 

the genesis block [177] of the Bitcoin blockchain on 03 January 2009? 

2.  How did you rummage and retrieve the ostensibly pivotal citation (2) [612] from the print-

only version of a local meeting on information theory in the Benelux? 

3.  How did you get hold of citation (8) [557], a first, 1957-edition of a textbook?  
4.  Why  do  so  many  time  zones  [231]  occur  in  your  online  life,  seemingly  encompassing,  and 

hence suggesting stays all over the (continental) US, the UK, and Central Europe? 

5.  Why do your texts blend American-British-Commonwealth spelling and idioms [563, 564, 570, 

571], while you seemed to have implemented a spell checker? 

6.  Where  does  the  rather  outdated  double-spacing  [285]  after  full  stops  of  sentences  come 

from? 

7.  Why were there statistically sound gaps in your hour-of-the-day (between 3 am and 11 am 
GMT),  day-of-the-week  (Tuesdays  and  Saturdays),  and  month-of-the-year  (March  to  May) 
schedules of your Bitcoin activities? 

8.  Why did you use OpenOffice [578, 579] for authoring the Bitcoin whitepaper? 
9.  Why did you run Microsoft Windows XP [591] on a rather slow machine? 

Somewhat Important 

1.  Was citation (2) [612] the eye-opener following the (2)&(6)-first hypothesis (Figure 1) on your 

journey to Bitcoin? 

2.  What was the reasoning behind the 6-day mining gap between the blocks 0 [177, 302] and 1 

[305]? 

3.  Why did you cite (8) [557], the first, 1957 edition of a textbook, in the Bitcoin whitepaper? 
4.  What  happened  when  you  mentioned  in  an  email  [299]  to  Hal  Finney  [70]  that  “I  cannot 

receive incoming connections from where I am” on 12 January 2009? 

5.  Why  did  you  include  code  for  virtual  Poker  [1000],  IRC  [1049],  and P2P  [986] marketplace 

client in an early version of the Bitcoin code? 

Curiosity 

•  Did you conceive and implement Bitcoin completely autonomously prior to the Bitcoin white-

paper? 

•  Did you ever  tell  anybody that  you were about to develop a  “peer-to-peer electronic cash 

system” that later became Bitcoin? 

•  Did you ever tell anybody, post-launch, that you are, or part of, “Satoshi Nakamoto”? 
•  Are / were you a cypherpunk? 
•  Did you attend the meeting on e-Gold [384, 385] in February 2000 [386, 387] at Anguilla [388]? 
•  Were you the user “X”, or read his daunting postings [397-399] in 2001? 
•  When did you start developing Bitcoin? 
•  Why did you start developing Bitcoin?

•  How  did  you  acquire  the  extraordinarily  wide,  expert-level  skill  set  required  to  instigate 

Bitcoin? 

•  What did you learn through formal education, your professional environment, or your inte-

rests / hobbies? 

•  Are you still interested, or even involved in Bitcoin / blockchain?  
•  Was your gradual and inconspicuous fading as Satoshi Nakamoto long planned? 
•  Were the upcoming CIA presentation, the Wikileaks discussions regarding Bitcoin, and / or the 
dynamics  on  the  online  groups  a  decisive  factor  in  your  decision  to  disappear  as  Satoshi 
Nakamoto? 

•  Why  did  you  only  cite  the  two  cypherpunk  projects  (1)  [270]  and  (6)  [269],  but  not,  for 

instance, the work of David Chaum [73, 486], Hal Finney [70], or Nick Szabo [71]? 

•  Did citations (1) [270] and (6) [269] play a major role in scoping Bitcoin, or did you mostly learn 
about them in hindsight when you were approaching Adam Back [69] for prior art in summer 
2008? 

•  Why is the bibliography in the Bitcoin whitepaper so outdated and short? 
•  Were you “shocked” when Hal Finney [70] retrieved the debug.log [923] disclosing a / your 

Los-Angeles based IP address on 10 January 2009?

Saturdays? 

•  Did / do you have a link to, or a penchant for Japan [454], e.g., its culture or language? 
•  Did you just wanted to throw a red herring [829], or are there messages behind your Japanese

nationality, pseudonym, and date of birth? 
In addition to their mathematical reasoning, is there any magic implanted in numbers like 21 
(or 42)? 

The Usual Suspects: Finney, Back, Dai, Szabo 
These four individuals are often quoted as likely fathers of Bitcoin, as they meet many of the obvious, 
previously established canon of attributes associated with Satoshi Nakamoto, such as their unques-
tionable expertise in cryptography, cryptocurrency, or their participation in the cypherpunk commu-

nity. Needless to mention that all four adamantly denied having invented Bitcoin at some stage. An 
excellent analysis of this quadruple eventually leading to Nick Szabo has been published by [65]; in its 
section “Who is Satoshi Nakamoto”, this article focusses on criteria that shed major doubt on their 
identity with Satoshi Nakamoto.  

First, being based and embedded in the USA, it is unlikely that cypherpunk Hal Finney [70, 1214, 1215], 
Nick Szabo [71, 609, 1216, 1217], or Wei Dai [72, 261] would have gotten notice, and have been able 
to  retrieve  citation  (2)  [612]  of  the  Bitcoin  whitepaper  [175].  However,  a  similar  version  [673]  on 
timestamping (3-5) [613-615], and containing a similar reference list highlighting the work by Stuart 
Haber [425] and Scott Stornetta [426] (Figure 1), was also presented by the same Quisquater group in 
1999 at Stanford [413], though citing [676] “instead of” (5) [615] as in the Bitcoin whitepaper. 

If this paper (2) [612] played a central role in the road to Bitcoin (Figure 1), it must have been obtained 
by Satoshi Nakamoto as a hardcopy that was mainly available from colleagues or select libraries in 
Benelux / Europe. It is thus hard to believe, that Hal Finney [70], Wei Dai [72], or Nick Szabo [71] would 
have found, and then included (2) [612] in the Bitcoin whitepaper. 

Given their immersion in the US-American culture, occasional slippage to British spelling, and quoting 
the headline [176] of (the print version of) the London-based “The Times” [303] in the genesis block 
[177] mentioning “the chancellor”, also seems to disqualify Finney, Dai, and Szabo. 

Third,  for  not  compromising  the  shield  of  his  anonymity,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  would  have  probably 
avoided circulating his real name in citations, early messages and postings, which would mostly elimi-
nate Hal Finney [299, 300, 1058], who had a track record as a brilliant coder [289, 689], but would also 
have communicated with himself [299, 1058, 1133] on the cryptography mailing list [283], Wei Dai (1) 
[72, 270], and also UK-based Adam Back [69] with hashcash (6) [269, 619]. 
While Back used to insert double-space before full stop, his 2002 paper (6) [269] quotes a personal 
communication with the other cypherpunk Hal Finney (and Thomas Boschloo [1218]) [1219] on an 
“improvement suggestion 5 years into hashcash to simplify the verification cost”, references Wei Dai’s 
[72] b-money [270] (1), and also Daniel Bernstein’s [122, 123] SYN cookies [620], but completely omits 
any 1990s publications on timestamping (2-5) [612-614] by Haber [425] and Stornetta [426]. In addi-
tion to citing himself, and the lack of reasoning why he even mentioned having been personally con-
tacted through email by the creator of Bitcoin in summer 2008, this constellation makes it unlikely 
that Adam Back is Satoshi Nakamoto, despite his range of relevant competences, and long-term mem-
bership of the cypherpunk scene [1220, 1221]. 
Candidates 
Just to stress that this article does not want to, and simply cannot credibly dox a particular person (or 
group) as “Satoshi Nakamoto”, simply because the author simply does not know. (However, the article 
might empower ruling out certain nominations.) Instead, this section is mainly intended to demon-
strate how the rather comprehensive collection of initially unrelated sources compiled in this article 
can make sense in terms of being fit to a person in the real world. First, a shortlist of cryptographers 
is scrutinized who showed best overlap with the Satoshi Nakamoto profile elaborated in this work. 
The  author  still  believes  that  Satoshi  Nakamoto  could  well  be  a  person  “like  them”.  Then,  other 
possible candidates are investigated. 
Best Matches 
This section presents certain a range of candidates who do not show major inconsistencies with the 
exclusion filters. However, their passing of negative selection criteria might be reasoned in missing 
information available to the author. Note that while the following individuals show gripping match to 
the hypothetical Satoshi Nakamoto profile sketched in the previous section, their individual connec-

tions  to  the  origins  of  Bitcoin  are  all  unconfirmed,  and  will  possibly  even  remain  unconfirmable 
without their (unlikely) own input. 
Daniel Bernstein 

The polymath Daniel J. Bernstein [122, 123] (born 29 October 1971 in East Patchogue, New York, USA) 
has  very  rarely  been  associated  with  the  context  of  Bitcoin  [88,  710,  1222].  Bernstein’s  (publicly 
known) core research focus has not been on cryptocurrency [2], but he might have suddenly been 
drawn into a rabbit hole when, out of sheer curiosity, he was taking a glance at the state-of-the-art in 
the mid-2000s. So, while staying active in his main daytime job academia, he created Bitcoin as a tran-
sient, “hobbyist”-type excursion to challenge his brilliant intellect. Preferring to stay incognito, he filed 
under the stage name “Satoshi Nakamoto”. After his exodus, Bernstein successfully “moved on” to 
advance exciting new ideas revolving about his mainstay interests in cryptography [709]. 

Bernstein graduated from high school in Long Island [1142, 1223], and top-ranked in the highly presti-
gious Putnam competition [1224] in 1987. He completed a B.A. in mathematics at New York University 
[750,  1142,  1144]  in  1991.  Bernstein  received  his  PhD  in  1995  from  the  University  of  California, 
Berkeley [412], i.e., before turning 25, thus convincingly displaying the key attributes of a highly gifted 
genius. Curiously, Berkeley resides within the Bay Area [675], the birthplace of the cypherpunk [165, 
166] movement in the first half of the 1990s, and a lot of his prior academic vita in the USA took place 
near the 42nd parallel North [720, 1138, 1144, 1223].  
In  his  postgraduate  studies,  Bernstein  was  supervised  by  Hendrik  Lenstra  [246],  who,  principally, 
worked in computational number theory, and is well known as the discoverer of  the elliptic curve 
factorization method, later at Leiden University  [434] in the Netherlands  [400], i.e.,  Benelux  [401]. 
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) [1056] methods are used in Bitcoin, and Lenstra was even briefly 
suggested as “Satoshi Nakamoto” [34] based on the Dutch IP address [174] as the origin of the pre-
viously mentioned, mysterious  postings of “X” titled “Virtual peer to peer banking”  on the  Usenet 
[392]  groups  alt.internet.p2p  and  uk.finance  [393].  Could  “Satoshi  Nakamoto”  be  embodied  by  a 
junior-senior academic dream team? 
Bernstein is a research professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago [720], and a 
visiting professor at CASA (“Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries”) [445] of the Ruhr 
University Bochum [1225], Germany. He is also a professor in TU Eindhoven [431, 432, 690, 1200] in 
the Netherlands [400], and still closely collaborates with their department of mathematics and com-
puter science, especially with Tanja Lange [432, 701, 702, 1226], since 2007. 
The founder of another cryptography stronghold in the Benelux [401], Ei/Psi [432], was Henk van Til-
borg [402, 690], who retired in 2011. He is a board member of WIC [629, 1227], the organizer of the 
Benelux symposium published [628] where the central citation (2) [612] to the whitepaper (Figure 1) 
was published. Tilborg was the PhD advisor of Stefan Brands [403, 1228-1230] in 1999, who published 
on electronic cash systems [478], and also collaborated with David Chaum [479] as early as 1993. 

Lange posted on the Cryptography Mailing List [283] in November 2008 [1231], even though not on 
the topic of the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] released only days before. She was also an invited speaker 
at the ECC 2003 (The 7th Workshop on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) [1056] on 11-13 August 2003 
at Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) [1232] along J.J. Quisquater [124, 125], the senior author of the second 
citation (2) [612] from the 1999 Benelux symposium [628, 631] in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. 

Hence, there is a tangible link to the “odd” second citation (2) [612] from a “networking” meeting in 
Benelux [401] region (which seemed to have also been presented only days later at Stanford [413, 
673]). Bernstein’s  mid-1990s work  [1233] is also cited as (5) in  the sixth reference (6) [269] of the 
Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. For the last three decades, Bernstein has been giving talks all over the planet 
[1234], including in 2006 on “High-speed cryptographic functions” [1159] at Chuo [1235], a private 
flagship research  university  in  Tokyo  [760], Japan [454]. His densely packed  travel schedule [1236] 

might also explain Satoshi Nakamoto’s comment on his temporary loss of online connectivity [299], 
and access to the UK print version of “The Times”. 

Already a student at University of California, Berkeley [412], Bernstein wanted to publish a paper inclu-
ding the source code on his “Snuffle” [1237] encryption system. Starting in 1995, he ran a multi-year, 
multi-stage  series  of  court  cases  on  whether  software  source  code  was  protected  by  “freedom  of 
speech”  guaranteed  under  the  First  Amendment  of  the  US  Constitution  [528];  these  disputes  ad-
dressed whether that the government's regulations preventing his publication, and thus the export of 
cryptography from the United States, were unconstitutional [527]. Bernstein thus definitely had inten-
sive exposure to legal matters and intelligence organizations. 
His name also  appeared  in  the  framework of the  above-described Keccak-SHA-3 controversy [547-
551]. In its aftermath, an article on “Sakura tree coding” was published [1158], acknowledging him, 
and the NIST [422, 546] hash team, for ”useful discussions”. Note the astonishing relation of Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s day of birth [888] around the Japanese cherry blossom “Sakura” [901], the striking name 
matching  with  the  previously  occurring  “Sakura  House”  [946-948]  accommodation  and  its  Tokyo 
neighborhoods [949, 950], and the registration of the privacy web services [118, 252-256, 940] to the 
same facility. 
Remarkably, but probably coincidental, Bernstein’s Google Scholar profile [709] displays one 2012-
publication  [1238]  in  Japanese  kanji  [1070]  writing;  its  senior  author  is  the  accomplished  Kouichi 
Sakurai [1239], a professor of mathematical informatics at Kyushu University [1240] in Fukuoka [1241], 
Japan. Amazingly, the generation-X [713] cryptologist is not listed as an author, but only cited with his 
famous  2009  book  entitled  “Post  Quantum  Cryptography”  [1242,  1243].  This  may  underpin  his 
exceptional academic reputation, and possible links to Japan. 
One of the fathers of blockchain [425] commented in an early article on the origins of Bitcoin [491] 
that “the community of cryptographers is very small: about three hundred people a year attend the 
most  important  conference,  the  annual  gathering  in  Santa  Barbara  [492,  589].  In  all  likelihood, 
Nakamoto belonged to this insular world. If I wanted to find him, the Crypto 2011 [1244] conference 
would be the place to start.” 

Daniel  Bernstein  chaired  the  “Dinner  and  Rump”  sessions  [1245-1250]  at  IACR’s  [494]  CRYPTO 
conference  series  [589]  during  the  build-up  to the  Bitcoin whitepaper  in  the  early  and mid-2000s; 
among co-chairs and presenters were J.-J. Quisquater [124, 125, 612, 625, 627] (1), Stuart Haber [425, 
613-615,  676]  (2-4),  Ralph  Merkle  [419,  616,  714-716]  (7),  David  Chaum  [73,  485,  486,  611],  Bart 
Preneel  [505,  677, 678], Tanja  Lange  [701, 702,  1251],  Jan  Boneh,  [365,  626, 627, 680,  1252],  Phil 
Zimmermann [74, 689, 1253, 1254], Cynthia Dwork [420], and Moni Naor [450]. 
Bernstein himself presented on “Smaller Decoding Exponents: Ball-Collision Decoding” with two co-
authors [701, 702, 1255, 1256] from TU Eindhoven [431] in the Netherlands [400] (Benelux [401, 628]), 
at this very meeting on 18 August 2011, i.e., probably coincidentally, exactly three years after register-
ing bitcoin.org [257, 258, 356], and well after Satoshi Nakamoto finally retired from Bitcoin, uttering 
that he “moved on to other things” [351] in later April 2011. With some “tongue-in-cheek”, Daniel 
Bernstein’s initials provide “The Answer to the Ultimate Question of … Everything:

Len Sassaman 

Born in 1980, the American technologist and cypherpunk Leonard (“Len”) Sassaman [46, 47, 77, 686, 
1257-1259]  (aka  “Rabbi”,  <rabbi  at  quickie.net>)  graduated  from  a  Pennsylvania-based  boarding 
school [1260, 1261] in 1998. Already as a teenager, he was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder 
[1198]. Reportedly [47], he suffered from traumatic experiences at the hands of “borderline sadistic” 
psychiatric  practitioners,  experiences  which  presumably  left  him  distrustful of purported  authority 
figures. 

Sassaman was an amazing autodidact who taught himself in cryptography [250], and protocol deve-
lopment, which the mainstay of his career revolved about. While only at the age of 18, he joined the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [1262] overlooking the TCP/IP [1263-1265] protocol underlying 
the internet, and later the Bitcoin network. In 1999, Sassaman relocated to the Bay Area [675], and 
moved in with Bram Cohen [288, 1266], who is best known for the peer-to-peer (P2P) [986] BitTorrent 
[287] protocol released in 2001. There are even rumors that the creation of Bitcoin emerged from a 
Sassaman-Finney combo (potentially including Bram Cohen, if he is a good actor [289, 1267-1271]), as 
Finney superior coding would have nicely complemented Sassaman’s talent [289]. 

He became a frequent, often pseudonymous contributor to the cypherpunk [47, 165, 166, 1272] and 
the cryptographer mailing list [1273], where Satoshi Nakamoto eventually launched the Bitcoin white-
paper on 31 October 2008. Besides his extraordinary contributions to computing, Sassaman also had 
a keen interest in biohacking [1274], also known as human augmentation or human enhancement, a 
do-it-yourself biology aimed at improving performance, health, and wellbeing through strategic inter-
ventions. 

Based on his distinguished expertise, he founded a start-up with the open-source activist Bruce Perens 
[1275] in the field of public-key cryptography, which went belly-up in the wake of the implosion of the 
dot-com bubble [1276]. Sassaman co-developed the GNU Privacy Guard implementation of OpenPGP 
[1262]; he designed, with PGP [689] inventor Phil Zimmerman [74], the “Zimmermann–Sassaman key-
signing” protocol [1253]. At Network Associates (now McAfee) [1277], he worked together with the 
early Bitcoin adopter Hal Finney [70, 300, 1058, 1133], whom he also occasionally cited in his papers 
[1278]. 
Sassaman was the maintainer of the popular Mixmaster anonymous remailer code [1279, 1280], and 
operator of the Randseed Remailer [1281]. The remailer technology was suggested by David Chaum 
[73]  together  with  cryptocurrency;  such  remailers  are  specialized  servers  for  sending  information 
anonymously or pseudonymously. They were the engine behind the notorious cypherpunk mailing list 
[1272]. The author was advised that more cues underpinning for the direct link between the origin of 
Bitcoin and Sassaman can be spotted in the code of Mixmaster [1279, 1280], where it is clear that the 
knowledge of C++ [975], plus the understanding of the Win32 [1282] API [1283], were the basis for 
the first Bitcoin version [1284]. 

The  ancestors  of  modern  cryptocurrencies  were  already  discussed  as  important  constituents  of 
remailers in the 1980s and 1990s [1285, 1286], and decentralized nodes distributed fixed-sized blocks 
of encrypted  info  across  a  P2P  [986]  network on  remailers,  and  thus showed essential  features  of 
Bitcoin. Also the cypherpunk, Bitcoin entrepreneur [1037-1039], and hot Satoshi Nakamoto candidate 
Adam Back [69] ran a remailer [1287]. In a 2007 paper [1288] at Black Hat [1289, 1290] which showed 
striking parallels to elements of Bitcoin, Sassaman cited, along with papers from Hal Finney [70], Bram 
Cohen [288], David Chaum [73], and Tim May [93], a personal communication with Adam Back [69], 
and acknowledged him, and the cypherpunks mailing list [167]. This gives evidence how closely the 
cypherpunk community was interconnected at the time. 
Sassaman was an avid advocate of information privacy [1167]; at the age of 21, he co-organized the 
protests  against  government  surveillance  and  the  arrest  of  Russian  programmer  Dmitry  Sklyarov 

[1291]. Already in his early 20s, Sassaman set up and presented at technology conferences like DEF 
CON [1292]. He was the co-founder of CodeCon along with Bram Cohen [288], and the HotPETS sym-
posium [1293] (with Roger Dingledine [1294] of Tor [408] and Thomas Heydt-Benjamin [1295]). Sassa-
man was a member of the Shmoo Group [1296]. In a 2005 paper [1278], Sassaman cites, amongst 
many others such as David Chaum [73], Hal Finney [70], Wei Dai [72], and (again), Adam Back [69], 
who all contributed crucial components that eventually entered Bitcoin. 

Open-source software, P2P [986], avoidance of trust in third parties, e.g., administrators of centralized 
computer networks, privacy and freedom-of-speech (and its legal implications), pseudonymity, and 
strong encryption, e.g., as implemented in PGP, were major buzz words Satoshi Nakamoto highlighted 
in the context of his Bitcoin whitepaper. 

Never  having  attended  college,  Sassaman  started  his  “dream”  postgraduate  studies  at  KU  Leuven 
[430] in Belgium [618] (Benelux [401]) in 2004, which he completed with a MSc in 2008 [1297]. One 
of his academic supervisors was the digital-currency pioneer David Chaum [73, 271, 485], who was 
based at UC Berkeley [412, 675] and Los Angeles [926]; his other (presumably main) supervisor was 
Bart Preneel [505, 677, 678], the head of the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) 
center [643]. In 2008, Sassaman submitted his Masters’ thesis “Toward an Information-Theoretically 
Secure Anonymous Communication Service” [1297]. Noticeably, the author could not retrieve the PDF 
on the internet – are there some fingerprints Sassaman wanted to conceal? 

Preneel was one of the designers of “RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest” (RIPEMD) 
[1298], which, in conjunction with “Secure Hash Algorithms” (SHA) [547, 548, 551, 1299], constitute 
the methods used to make a Bitcoin address from a public key, specifically SHA256 and RIPEMD160 
[210].  During  Sassaman’s  postgraduate  period  in  the  2000s,  Preneel  presented  at  events  in  Japan 
[679], and (co-)supervised a PhD thesis by Kazuo Sakiyama [1300, 1301]. 
As pointed out previously in the context of the pivotal citation (2) [612] in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175] 
from  the  Quisquater  [124,  125]  group  from  UC  Louvain  [637]  (i.e.,  also  situated  at  Leuven  [672]), 
Preneel, and another top-notch researcher Joos Vandewalle [511, 644, 645], co-authored in the same 
proceedings  of  the  local  Benelux  symposium  [628]  on  “Anonymity  controlled  electronic  payment 
systems” [680], and had another contribution [681] that was first-authored by “Jorge Nakahara Jr” 
[648-650], presumably a researcher from the Japanese-Brazilian [684] minority. 

Even  though  Len  Sassaman  is  very  unlikely  to  have been  an  attendee of  the Benelux meeting,  for 
instance, due to his young age (~19), and his US-based residence in 1999, he might have gained access 
to the hardcopy [628] containing (2) [612] in his later postgraduate studies through Preneel’s personal 
book collection, or the local library at KU Leuven [430].  
Alternatively,  Sassaman  might  have  gotten  hold  of  the  proceedings  [628]  featuring  (2)  [612]  as  he 
joined the organizing WIC [629, 630, 686], and also published at the symposium with his wife Meredith 
Patterson  [1302]  in  2007  [1303]  on  “Subliminal  Channels  in  the  Private  Information  Retrieval  Pro-
tocols”, and  with his  local PhD  supervisor Bart  Preneel in 2008  [1252] on “The Byzantine Postman 
Problem”, which alludes to the “Byzantine Generals Problem” [1189] in Bitcoin. Sassaman attended 
[686] CRYPTO 2006 [1304] in Santa Barbara [492], where his supervisor Bart Preneel [505] chaired a 
session; talks in the program [1305], and conversations with other participants, might have further 
sparked his journey towards Bitcoin. 

Post  2008,  Sassaman  was  a  program  committee  member  of  the  13th  International  Conference  on 
Financial  Cryptography  and  Data  Security  [1306],  held  in  February  2009  at  the  island  country  of 
Barbados [1306], and joined the “International Financial Cryptography Association” (IFCA) [1307] in 
2010.  

Sassaman was characterized [47] as “always kind of the odd kid because he was smart” and people 
remembered  “intelligent  and  lighthearted,  chasing  down  a  squirrel  at  a  Cypherpunk  meeting  and 

speeding around in a sports car with a brazen ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card in case he was pulled over.” 
On  February  11,  2006,  at  the  5th  CodeCon,  Sassaman  proposed  to  returning  speaker  Meredith  L. 
Patterson [1302, 1303] during the Q&A after her presentation, and they then married [77]. His wife is 
a linguist by training who was also familiar with the crypto scene and computer science; Patterson was 
diagnosed with autism [1013] in her adulthood. 

Very poignantly, Sassaman decided to end his young life at the age of 31 on 03 July 2011, i.e., just 
weeks after Satoshi Nakamoto sent his last known email (of widely undisputed origin) on 26 April 2011 
[1308, 1309], and his final tweets regarding Bitcoin on 24 June 2011. 

Sassaman thus ticks a large number of the boxes, and would have certainly had the vita, intellect, skill 
set, psychogram and motivation  to  create Bitcoin. His studies at KU Leuven [430] in Belgium  [618] 
might also explain Satoshi Nakamoto’s occasional British spelling, the headline in “The Times” in the 
Bitcoin genesis block, the citation of the 1957 book (8) [557] which is / was available in the local library, 
the DD/MM/YYY date format [913], and reference to the Euro currency [353]. The Japanese last name 
of his pseudonym might have been inspired by Jorge Nakahara Jr. [648, 649], who was his colleague 
at the time in the research group around Bart Preneel [505, 677, 678] and Joos Vandewalle [511, 644, 
645] at KU Leuven [430], or other (former) COSIC members with Japanese-looking names, and inter-
national cryptographers [650, 688, 695-699, 1310]. 

Certain inconsistencies remain, e.g., his C++ [975] programming in a Win32 [1282] environment while 
being known as an Apple Macintosh  [1311] user, and evidently  the Satoshi  Nakamoto postings (of 
debatable genuineness) past his demise [8, 861]. Possible resolutions of these paradoxes have been 
suggested,  for  instance,  that  Bitcoin  had  a  group  of  creators,  e.g.,  Len  Sassaman  [77]  himself,  Hal 
Finney [70], and Bram Cohen [288], playing different roles [1269]. 
Nevertheless, Len Sassaman has been frequently nominated as Satoshi Nakamoto [1312, 1313], and 
a digital obituary has been embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain [46, 47, 1312-1319], and the matching 
with new evidence presented in this work support this hypothesis. Several open still questions, like 
the citation (8) of the 1957 edition of a book [557, 712] in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], the penchant 
for  mathematical  puns  and  historical  associations,  would  be  virtually  impossible  to  clarify  post-
humously. 
With this wealth of supporting circumstantial evidence, mostly carved out in an excellent 2021-article 
[47], it is disillusioning to read Len Sassaman’s tendentially very negative speech on Twitter [1320] 
(search: from:@lensassaman bitcoin), for instance, referring to Bitcoin as “overhyped”, and a “heist”. 
His wife even commented to one of them: “The trouble with bitcoin jokes is they're just not worth the 
time you put into them.” If not a deep fake, hack, bunk, part of his sophisticated disguise, or a sign of 
his severe depression, these dismissive, very negative sentiments bluntly reveal that Sassaman (and 
Patterson) did not like Bitcoin (anymore?). 

Intriguingly, Sassaman’s tweets on Bitcoin started on 07 December 2010, i.e., just around the time 
when Satoshi Nakamoto posted last on the Bitcoin forum, and stopped contributing to the code, and 
ended 24 June 2011, i.e., about a week before he sadly decided to take his own life on Sunday, 03 July 
2011 [1321]. 
It can be speculated that his severe depressive episode might have drastically escalated through his 
frustration about side effects, like Silk Road [543], and unforeseen shortcomings of his own brainchild; 
this perception might have utterly flipped his attitude towards Bitcoin, which he had hoped to develop 
in a different direction for the good of mankind and his ideals as a cypherpunk. Such sea change be-
havior towards their own masterpieces has been previously observed with geniuses affected by men-
tal disorders [1009]. 

It would be interesting to know whether Len Sassaman briefed his wife [1302] on his (alleged) involve-
ment  in  Bitcoin,  and  handed  over  private  keys  to  Bitcoin  addresses  and  passwords  to  his  online 

accounts.  In  her  reply  to  on  Twitter  (@maradydd)  [1322] to  rumors  about  her  late  husband  being 
Satoshi Nakamoto [47] in February 2021, Patterson denied: “It's a very well-researched and respectful 
article, but to the best of my knowledge, Len was not Satoshi.” 
His own, and his wife’s more recent, daunting comments substantially taint the hypothesis that Len 
Sassaman was the creator of Bitcoin. Still, Meredith Patterson tellingly tweeted almost at the same 
time as Satoshi Nakamoto entirely disappeared from newsgroups on 07 December 2010: “Bitcoin isn't 
ready for prime time yet, according to its creator. Interested people can help finish it, though!” [1323]. 
How would she have been able to “know” about the intention of Satoshi Nakamoto in these early days 
of Bitcoin? Was she referring to one of his online postings, or did she have personal insight? 
The author hypothesizes that, if he was Satoshi Nakamoto, and considering that he most probably had 
a well devised exit strategy at hand from the very outset, Len Sassaman must have undoubtedly antici-
pated that his profile will, sooner or later, become a prime suspect, so he needed to spread a glaring 
inconsistency. 
Phil Zimmermann 

Born in 1954, the US-American computer celebrity Philip “Phil” Zimmermann [74] obtained a B.S. in 
computer science at Florida Atlantic University [1324] in 1978. His interest in the political side of cryp-
tography grew out of his background in military policy issues. 

He was inducted into  the Internet  Hall of Fame [1325] in 2012 for having developed “Pretty Good 
Privacy”  (PGP)  [689]  (supported  by  Hal  Finney  [70]),  an  encryption  program  that  provides  crypto-
graphic privacy and authentication for data communication, e.g., email, in 1991. The PGP case against 
US government [1326] regarding infringement of US export regulations on cryptography [1173, 1326] 
was dropped in 1996 [1173].  
On the academic side, Zimmermann is an Associate Professor Emeritus of cybersecurity at Delft Uni-
versity  of  Technology  [639],  in  the  Netherlands  [400],  received  an  Honorary  Doctorate  from  the 
Université Libre de Bruxelles [433, 706] (Belgium [618]) in 2016, and is a fellow of the Center for Inter-
net and Society [1327] at Stanford [413]. He is the co-inventor Zimmermann–Sassaman key-signing 
protocol [1253] and was / is involved in “Voice over IP” (VoIP) [1328] and SilentCircle [1329]. 
Consequently, Phil Zimmermann ticks quasi all essential requirements for being Satoshi Nakamoto, 
e.g., his qualifications in cryptography, privacy technology and reticence, computer science (program-
ming, networking), his resilience, political attitude, pioneering spirit, extensive experience with the 
legal system [1326, 1330], his connection with the Benelux ecosystem (2) [612], and his track record 
in- and outside academia. 
His age (about 54 in 2008) might explain the rather ancient list of citations (1-8), culminating in the 
1957 book (8) [557], the double-spacing after the period, and the international, American-European 
projects and involvements might explain time zones, timestamps, and access to “The Times” as an 
English  speaker  outside  abroad,  e.g.,  in  Brussels  [706].  No  wonder  his  name  has,  even  though 
astonishingly rarely, been proposed as Satoshi Nakamoto [1331]. 
Intriguingly, Zimmermann opined “Anyone who claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin is lying” [1254]. 
This  -  only  superficially  -  simple  statement  intrinsically  necessitates  the  knowledge  of  a  single, 
exclusive  holder  of  the  secret  around  the  origin  of  Bitcoin,  with  the  distinct  exception  of  himself. 
Hence, his plain testimony might thus – at least at second thought, and with a grain of salt – be logically 
construed as either “I am Satoshi Nakamoto, but I will never come out”, or “I know the real identity 
behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, but I am absolutely certain he / she / they are never going 
to tell”. Otherwise, the man, who is most famous for the encryption program PGP [689], which pro-
vides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication, would act blatantly untruth-
ful. 

The author would personally question that anybody, other than Satoshi Nakamoto himself, whether 
an  individual  or  team,  would  know  about  his  /  her  /  their  real  identity.  Deliberately  sharing  such 
knowledge would require life-long trust, which is risky, and those who learnt about the secret without 
consent of the creator of Bitcoin would have probably been already too much tempted to leak. 

Anecdotally, Phil Zimmermann externally communicates a rather skeptical attitude towards Bitcoin, 
for instance, criticizing its energy consumption to sustain PoW. 
Bart Preneel 

Factoring in the deluge of evidence, it seems the elephant in the room is the head of COSIC [643] at 
KU Leuven [430], Bart Preneel [505, 677-679]. His name popped up in copious independent contexts 
of this article. Born on 15 October 1963 in Leuven [672], he received an electrical engineering degree 
in applied science in 1987, and completed his PhD entitled “Analysis and design of cryptographic hash 
function” in 1993, both at KU Leuven [430]; Preneel’s advisor was the internationally highly accom-
plished  Joos  Vandewalle  [511,  644,  645]  (with  René  Govaerts  [1332])  with  whom  he  co-authored 
numerous publications in the following years. He is a very active member, and acted as president of 
the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) [494] organizing the CRYPTO conference 
series [429, 456, 589] in 2008-2013. 

There is a long  list of  Preneel’s  significant contributions to cryptography. Most relevant to for  this 
article,  Preneel  is  one  of  the  authors  of  the  RIPEMD-160  [1298]  hash  function,  which  is  a  key 
component of Bitcoin. Along with Shoji Miyaguchi [1333], he independently invented the Miyaguchi–
Preneel scheme [1334]. He was also a co-inventor of the stream cipher MUGI [1335] which was among 
the cryptographic techniques recommended for Japanese government use by CRYPTREC in 2003. 

Through his role in KU Leuven [430], Preneel notably led the European FP7 [1336] projects ECRYPT 
[1337] (2004-2008) I [1338], and ECRYPT II (2008-2013) [1339]. Several players that have appeared in 
course  of  this  article  are  amongst  the  member  and  associated  institutions:  UC  Louvain  [637],  TU 
Eindhoven [431], EPFL [1340], Ruhr-Universität Bochum [1225], Aarhus University [447, 1341], Royal 
Holloway (University of London) [1342], Universität Duisburg-Essen [651], IBM Research [1343]. Tanja 
Lange [701, 702], Arjen Lenstra [442], and Nigel Smart [436] show up in the list of researchers. The 
ECRYPT [1337] projects referred to foundational work on GQ-scheme [1344], which was co-invented 
by J.J. Quisquater [124, 125] at UC Louvain [672]. 
Bart Preneel’s comprehensive list of publications [679] features several publications on electronic cash 
/ payment systems pre-dating Bitcoin [1345, 1346]. For instance, his postgraduate student Joris Claes-
sens  [647]  (co-promoter:  Joos  Vandewalle)  submitted  a  PhD  thesis  in  2002  entitled  “Analysis  and 
design of an advanced infrastructure for secure and anonymous electronic payment systems on the 
Internet” [1347]; J.J. Quisquater [124, 125] on the jury. 
Claessens thesis cites work from researchers that recurrently appeared in this study, especially in the 
context of e-cash / cryptocurrencies: Dan Boneh [80], , Stefan Brands [403, 1228], David Chaum [73], 
Jan Camenisch [514, 1348], Ivan Damgård [446], Ian Goldberg [428], Eiichiro Fujisaki [1349], Tatsuaki 
Okamoto [488, 489, 504], Kazuo Ohta [502], Ralph Merkle [419, 714] (7) [616] Silvio Micali [81], Ronald 
Rivest [509], Tomas Sander [1350], David Wagner [415], Bruce Schneier [721], Moti Yung [513], and 
his own group [1351], but not Quisquater (2) [612] pointing to Stuart and Haber (3-5) [613-615] on 
timestamping, or any e-cash systems from the cypherpunk scene, such as (1) [270] and (6) [269]. Along 
with Joos Vandewalle [511, 644, 645], Claessens attended the 1999 symposium [628] in the Benelux 
where (2) [612] was published, and presented on “Anonymity controlled electronic payment systems” 
[680]. 

In a 1996-chapter Preneel senior authored [1352], even the “antiquated” book on probability theory 
(8)  [557]  cited  in  the  Bitcoin  whitepaper  [175]  is  referenced  (even  though  in  its  slightly  “younger” 
edition  from  1968  [1353]).  He  also  co-authored  with  David  Chaum  since  the  early  1990s  [1354], 

collaborated various times with J.J. Quisquater [124], in particular on the TIMESEC project [626] that 
led to (2) [612], and communicated with [1355], and cited by Haber and Stornetta (3-5) [613-615]. As 
mentioned above, Preneel published many times with his graduate student Len Sassaman [77, 679, 
1259, 1297], e.g., in 2008 [1252] on “The Byzantine Postman Problem” [1189]. 

As a cryptographer, he was naturally well of Ralph Merkle’s [419, 714] foundational work (7) around 
1980 [616], e.g., by manifold citations in his own papers [1356, 1357]. Maybe Preneel collated the 
missing items that were available to him in the years to come prior to the Bitcoin whitepaper. Starting 
in 2016/2017, Preneel published also on Bitcoin [1358, 1359]. 

As a world-leading  pioneer, and  internationally highly networked researcher  in the  field of crypto-
graphy, Preneel would certainly have (had) the skill set to conceive Bitcoin. He worked near Brussels 
[706] where he might have been able to grab a copy of UK-print version of “The Times” [303, 304] on 
03 January 2009, and his connections into Japan might have inspired his pseudonym. Preneel most 
likely had a busy travel schedule, which might explain different time zones of his postings. Even J.-J. 
Quisquater [124] has only quite recently pointed to this option [1360]. From the first two letters of his 
given name, and with a sense of humor, it can be recognized 
, which 
plays a huge, and repeated role in the design of the Bitcoin blockchain. Hence, with some humoristic 
imagination, Bart Preneel might be half of the “Answer to everything” [1101]. 

(B ↦ 2, A ↦ 1) ⇒ 21 = 42/2

However, other “Satoshiness” attributes do not seem to match that well from an external perspective, 
e.g.,  his  mediocre  computer  hardware  and  usage  of  OpenOffice  while  presumably  well-versed  in 
LATEX.  As  the  head  of  a  large  research  institute,  Preneel  might  also  simple  not  have  had  the 
bandwidth to lead research and represent during daytime, and sneak into the backroom for pulling 
off  Bitcoin  afterhours.  It  would  be  up  to  Bart  Preneel  to  comment  on  his  nomination  as  “Satoshi 
Nakamoto”; the author’s hunch is that if he is not (part of) Satoshi Nakamoto, he would know the 
person, possibly not as the architect of Bitcoin, or at least have the most qualified punt on his real 
identity. 
Leuven-Eindhoven Ecosystem 

In any case, it “smells” like the Leuven / Eindhoven ecosystem, that Preneel is / was so evidently an 
integral part of, and its international collaborators (e.g., US, Canada, Japan), has something to do with 
the creation of Bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin was created by all, or a subset of colluding researchers like Bart 
Preneel, his postgraduate student Len Sassaman [77] with his co-supervisor David Chaum [73], Joos 
Vandewalle [645], Nigel Smart [436], and J.-J. Quisquater [124] from Leuven [672], plus Daniel Bern-
stein [122], Tanja Lange [702], and Henk van Tilborg [402] affiliated with TU Eindhoven [431], or Philips 
[664-667], and Phil Zimmermann [74]. These experts may have played different roles, such as active 
drivers, or nescient facilitators. 

In addition to the already referenced collaboration and co-publishing, there are further links, for in-
stance, that the Grand Opening of Ei/Psi [1361] at TU Eindhoven on 21 April 2008 was hosted / atten-
ded by Henk van Tilborg [402], Tanja Lange [702], Daniel Bernstein [122], and Bart Preneel [505], plus 
cypherpunk Bruce Schneier [721] from Harvard [421] in the Bay Area [675]. David Chaum’s [73] name 
popped  up  in  connection  with  Bart  Preneel  [505],  e.g.,  co-authored  publications  and  conference 
organization, and the co-supervision of Len Sassaman [77] at KU Leuven. The author deems the odds 
that the Benelux cryptography ecosystem and its immediate international periphery, especially in the 
UK [69, 599] (cf. next subsection) and USA [165, 166, 168, 412, 413, 421, 493, 617, 675, 720, 750, 926, 
1142, 1144, 1362], did not play a key enabling role in the creation of Bitcoin as very slim. 
Great Britain 
Regarding the native-level British English in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], and the headline in the print-
only UK version “The Times” [304] headquartered in London which was engraved in the genesis block 
[176, 177], activities in the top-notch cryptography arena in the UK [599, 1363] might be of relevance. 

Other than the high-ranking Satoshi Nakamoto suspect Adam Back [69] discuss further above, these 
researchers have not been in the spotlight, and are primarily brought up here as possible links to solve 
the conundrum; there is no compelling evidence supporting their direct involvement in the creation 
of Bitcoin. 
Malcolm J. Williamson 

Historically, the accomplished cryptographer Malcolm J. Williamson [423, 424], worked at GCHQ [438] 
in early 1970s to 1982, then moved to the IDA’s [1364] Center for Communications Research [424] in 
La Jolla [1365] near San Diego [1366] (Southern California [493], USA), presumably on classified pro-
jects. He was born in 1950, and passed away in 2015, i.e., around the time when Satoshi Nakamoto 
eventually went silent (so far). Therefore, Williamson’s profile offers a few explanations for the mix of 
British and American English, his intelligence background, his anonymity, and possibly the time zone 
data. 
As Baby Boomer [1183], his advanced age of about 58 years in 2008 can well explain a double-spacing 
habit, the rather dated reference list in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], and he might even have naturally 
come  across the 1957-book  (8)  [557]  during his advanced studies. Whether Williamson was a pro-
ficient C++ coder, used OpenOffice [579], had access to citation (2) [612] (Figure 1) and the UK print 
version of “The Times” (probably if he resided in his country of birth on 03/01/2009), and met other 
“Satoshiness” filters could not be verified. 
Ross J. Anderson 

The well-known British cryptographer Ross J. Anderson [437] is a professor in security engineering at 
the University Cambridge [1363]; He boasts a track record as an industry consultant, and is an out-
spoken defender of academic freedoms, intellectual property and other matters of university politics. 
He has published on the bigger picture of Bitcoin, e.g., in a 2018 paper titled “Making Bitcoin legal” 
[1367]. 
Sean Murphy 

Having received a PhD from University of Bath in 1989, the British cryptographer Sean Murphy [439] 
worked on international projects with project with Bart Preneel [505, 677] from COSIC [643] in the 
early 2000s. He is now faculty at Royal Holloway, University of London [1342]. His publication activity 
shows a slight dip around the years 2007 and 2008. 
Aggelos Kiayias 

The Greek [1368] cryptographer and computer scientist Aggelos Kiayias [1369] is a professor at the 
University of Edinburgh [1370] in Scotland [1112], and the Chief Science Officer (CSO) at the company 
behind the cryptocurrency Cardano [23]. His PhD in 2002 was supervised by Moti Yung [513] at the 
City  University  of  New  York  [1362].  Note  that  Moti  Yung  took  on  the  same  role,  also  in  2002,  for 
Jonathan Katz [417, 1371] at Columbia University [1372] in New York City [750]. 
Further Examples 

A large number of other Satoshi Nakamoto candidates have been tabled in various media. The follow-
ing subsection highlights several profiles which meet a good portion of the criteria attributed to the 
still unidentified father of Bitcoin, while they also feature crucial contradictions. There are also some 
dark horses, e.g., formerly or actively affiliated with three-letter intelligence organizations [460, 461, 
544, 554, 842-849, 851, 852] at the time, or the huge talent pools, e.g., pertaining (at some career 
stage) to the computer science programs [73, 80, 122, 412, 413, 415, 428, 1373, 1374], and the quite 
interwoven cypherpunk [165] initiative that spawned from the San Francisco Bay Area [675]. 
Elon Musk 

The South-African born business magnate Elon Musk [15] (born on 28 June 1971) has been occasion-
ally affiliated with the invention of Bitcoin [1375]. He publicly denied [1376], even saying that he would 

tell in public if he had been the person behind Satoshi Nakamoto [59, 918, 1376]. While his skill set, 
e.g., in software, internet, and artificial intelligence (Zip2 [1377], OpenAI [1378]), payment systems 
(PayPal [1379]), and advanced technology [1380-1382], as well as his dazzling intelligence of a true 
genius,  his  autodidactic  skills,  highly  multi-disciplinary  “thinking  outside  the  box”  attitude,  his  un-
paralleled entrepreneurial resolve, his rare openness of taking huge risks against all odds, and even 
his Asperger condition, would have likely enabled him to invent Bitcoin. Musk is assumed to be profi-
cient in C++ [975], and, being from South Africa [1113], some British / Commonwealth [565] influence 
in his writing may be explained. 

However, it needs to be considered that just his involvement in the pioneering electric car company 
Tesla [1383] since 2004 might have been, even for him, far too demanding to silently develop Bitcoin 
as a side activity in the years before 2008, when the company was in the final, highly stressful stages 
of launching its first automotive product, and Musk eventually assumed the role of CEO. 

Moreover,  Musk’s  common,  long-term  investment  approach  to  business  would  contrast  Satoshi 
Nakamoto’s sudden departure from Bitcoin in 2010/2011, and his distinct psychogram as a very out-
spoken, constantly tweeting, “rock-star” entrepreneur starkly clashes with the more introvert, tech-
nically minded Satoshi Nakamoto who clearly avoided any public exposure. It is also hard to construe 
how  Elon  Musk  would  have  gotten  hold  of  the  hardcopy  of  citation  (2)  [612],  and  his  academic-
research style of writing in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175]. 
Paul Le Roux 

↦

 Satoshi?) Calder Le Roux. 

In  a  2019  article  in  Wired and  some  follow-ups  [42, 58,  76,  1384,  1385],  the  programmer,  former 
criminal cartel boss, and informant to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) [1386] Paul Le 
Roux  [1387] was posited as Satoshi Nakamoto. Born on 24 December 1972  in South Africa  [1113], 
most information about him is only known from secondary sources. Le Roux is reported to possess a 
diplomatic passport of the Democratic Republic of Congo [1388], issued on 05/08/2008 to the name 
Paul Salotshi (
After  dropping  out  of  school  at  the  age  of  16  and  embarking  on  a  programmer  career,  Le  Roux 
developed  the  open-source  disk  encryption  program  for  Microsoft  Windows  E4M  [1389],  and, 
arguably, open-source TrueCrypt [1390]. 
Le Roux was arrested on 26 September 2012 for conspiracy to import narcotics into the United States. 
He subsequently conceded to planning or partaking in several murders to set up a wide-ranging illegal 
business organization; Le Roux was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment in June 2020 [1387]. 
His astonishing catalogue of presumably self-taught competences, intelligence, and fit with a number 
of aspects that are attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto, it is hard to envision how the two psychograms 
would match. Besides, the invention and implementation Bitcoin could hardly have been a side project 
while building up an illicit empire involving the assassination of people. 

Furthermore, the pseudo-academic style of the very technically, and excellently written Bitcoin white-
paper [175], particularly the inclusion of a paper from a local symposium that was mostly available, at 
the  time,  as  a  hardcopy  in  the  Benelux  (2)  [612],  and  the  lack  of  overlap  with  many  other  points 
outlined in this article most likely exclude Le Roux a Satoshi Nakamoto candidate. 
Craig Wright 

Upon  the  release  of  the  preprint  of  my  document,  the  author  was  communicating  with  Dr.  Craig 
Wright [37, 57, 99, 812, 1391-1400] who is, according to the author’s best knowledge at the time of 
writing, the most prominent person who (at least seriously and repeatedly) claims to be the inventor 
of Bitcoin (in public). Wright’s statement is fiercely contested by an apparently solid majority of the 
Bitcoin and crypto communities [8, 57, 1395, 1401-1413]. 

However,  since  his  highly  publicized,  apparently  not  entirely  voluntary  coming  out  in  2015/2016, 
Wright has underpinned his position in courts, whether as defendant or plaintiff of libel cases [103-
108,  1414]  against  major  stakeholders  in  the  crypto  industry  and  journalism.  Nowadays,  Wright 
complains that his original idea of Bitcoin has been substantially altered, especially through the SegWit 
[1415] and Taproot [1416] updates, to an extent that he became an activist against Bitcoin’s present 
implementation, while promoting another electronic payment system [1032]. 

From the author’s neutral position,  Wright makes a lot of statements about his unique, amazingly 
broad portfolio of competences, formal qualifications, and diverse entrepreneurial and employment 
record that, if confirmed, would indeed make him a strong candidate for Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Yet, for instance, given the psychogram transpiring from the Bitcoin whitepaper, it can be assumed 
that Satoshi  Nakamoto  would  have certainly anticipated  the public  expectation of  a clear proof of 
identity, primarily through using the private keys for moving coins residing at Bitcoin addresses that 
are attributed to him [374, 375]. 

He could also send a message from email accounts he used during his online life as Satoshi Nakamoto. 
(However, such evidence would still need to factor in that a hoaxer could have gotten control of such 
digital  fingerprints  through  alternative  means.)  Wright  stubbornly  continues  to  contend  that  such 
evidence  was  unsuitable  for  proving  the  real-world  identity  of  Satoshi  Nakamoto,  a  point  which  is 
ferociously challenged by major fractions of the community. 

Instead, Wright tends to repeatedly produce rather soft evidence, like his exceptionally broad set of 
Bitcoin-relevant  skills,  his  staggering  number  of  patent  filings,  and  his  relevant  professional  track 
record and private life. His explanations for the citations of the 1999 Benelux symposium (2) [612], 
and the 1957-edition of the textbook (8) [557] remained vague. Would he have had access to the UK 
(print-only) version of “The Times” [747], run Windows XP on a rather low-end hardware around 2008, 
and used OpenOffice for authoring the Bitcoin whitepaper? 
Wright also ran into  ostensible contradictions, e.g., by asserting “I had to know what I was coding 
before a coded.”, while Satoshi Nakamoto posted “I had to write all the code before I could convince 
myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.” Surprisingly, and in addition to Adam 
Back’s [69] “hashcash” [269] as cited as (6) in the Bitcoin whitepaper [175], Wright attributed inspira-
tion for Bitcoin to a Finnish group around Tuomas Aura [1417, 1418] at Helsinki University of Techno-
logy [1419] (since 2011: Aalto University [1420]) who published on “how the robustness of authenti-
cation protocols against denial of service attacks can be improved by asking the client to commit its 
computational resources to the protocol run before the server allocates its memory and processing 
time” [1421]. 
Playing devil’s advocate, the very scarce information Satoshi Nakamoto revealed about himself left 
the world with an open canvas of his biography; it can be contended that essentially anybody from a 
credible  age  group  who  understands  the  Bitcoin  technology  platform  through the  whitepaper  and 
related  books,  and  had  studied  Satoshi  Nakamoto’s  public  postings,  could  have  wrapped  a  rather 
plausible, but fictional story around this skeleton. This makes it also difficult to formally disprove a 
claim on being Satoshi Nakamoto. 
In a final attempt, the author just accepted that Wright would, for some reason, have lost possession 
of the widely demanded, Bitcoin-blockchain based proof of identity. Wright could have then still made 
his case at least more credible if he was to provide evidence dating prior to August 2008 when he first 
used his pseudonym, or the release of the whitepaper on 31 October 2008; the author suggested that 
Wright ought to provide authentic documentation, witness, or a detailed description of key “Eureka” 
moments while conceiving Bitcoin, e.g., when he came up with the unprecedented solution for the 
notorious double-spending or single-point-of-failure issues through (a clever combination of) concepts 
like a distributed ledger, proof-of-work (“mining”), and a hash-linked chain of timestamped blocks. 

Overall, Wright became increasingly fluffy when approaching hard proof, which, he argued, will be 
produced at some stage in courtrooms by “people”. His exit strategy was that he is actually not in-
terested in confirming his statements on being Satoshi Nakamoto, and rather quickly transformed into 
an activist against the present form of Bitcoin, while promoting his new, competing system [1032], 
and other project(s). 

In  the  extended  interaction  with  the  author  of  this  article,  Wright  produced  an  unnecessarily 
emotionalized atmosphere, with a hot-tempered rhetoric spiced with many hot-headed swearwords 
and rather despicable language, and his serial filing of libel and defamation cases including personal 
intimidation and threats (against the author) are in stark contrast to the characteristics and mindset 
of  Satoshi  Nakamoto  that  the  author  sensed  when  reading  his  Bitcoin  whitepaper  and  2009/2010 
online postings. 

His multi-day chat with Wright left the author quite perplexed: In general, tabling a claim for the iden-
tity of an(other) individual, as per definition of this very word, can only have a binary outcome: Either 
Wright is indeed the creator of Bitcoin, meaning the genius who already changed the age of informa-
tion, or he is an imposter with a confusing strategy and objectives. What is his benefit of filing libel 
cases if he is not willing to prove his identity according to widely acceptable standards? 
Why would Wright impose the stress upon himself of coming out or assuming another identity for the 
rest of his life, knowing that he will never be able to substantiate his claim to the satisfaction of the 
community? If he was a pretender, why is Wright not afraid that the real “Satoshi Nakamoto” would 
appear – does he know about his fate of never being willing or able to ever appear on stage, or does 
he  even  collude  with  him?  In  fairness,  if  Wright  is  not  able  or  willing  to  produce more  compelling 
evidence, the overwhelming fraction of the crypto community will most likely remain in serious doubt. 

A more recently launched, rather adventurous hypothesis [67] interweaves the assumed involvement 
of Paul Le Roux in the creation of Bitcoin with the double-team of Craig Wright [96] and Dave Kleiman 
[117], and their, presumably jointly owned, company “W&K Information Defense Research LLC”. A 
notorious court case of in Florida [1422, 1423] dealt with the rights to more than 5 billion USD worth 
of Bitcoin, claiming that Wright defrauded Kleiman of bitcoins and intellectual property rights. Leaked 
official documents spurred rumors that Wright might have played a role in the arrest of Le Roux. It is 
surmised that Craig Wright (and possibly Kleiman) had somehow been able to take possession of Paul 
Le Roux’s encrypted hard drives that store the private keys for controlling the alleged, about 1 million 
BTC believed to reside in Bitcoin addresses controlled by Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Due to Le Roux’s long-term imprisonment, and after Kleiman’s death, Craig Wright reckoned that, with 
the  huge  calculation  power  provided  by  a  sufficiently  large  computer  farm,  he  could  crack  the 
encrypted  media  within  a  long-haul,  multi-year,  or  even  decade-lasting  effort.  In  case  of  success, 
Wright would still have to move the BTC, which would immediately and broadly be noticed by the 
community,  and  federal  agencies.  For  cashing  out  in  fiat  money,  especially  in  view  of  Satoshi’s 
mindboggling assets, would require KYC / AML registered bank accounts, and thus unavoidably reveal 
his  identity.  If  this  bold,  and  completely  unproven  story  was  true,  Craig  Wright  must  thus  have 
pondered that putting a claim on being Satoshi Nakamoto gave him a chance to liquidate “his” (~1 
million) BTC. A similar plot would apply to the Kleiman case; it has been said that Wright may somehow 
have acquired Kleiman’s encrypted drive holding the private keys to (half of) the BTC mined by Satoshi 
Nakamoto.  Evidently  this  latter  narrative  would  require  that  Wright  and  /  or  Kleiman  (or  their 
company W&K)  were  the team  behind, or involved in the creation of Bitcoin, or at least early-day 
miners. The author of this article is neither able to confirm nor dismiss the validity of this purported 
plot. 
The author leaves it up to the esteemed reader to map the narratives dispensed by Craig Wright [812, 
1391, 1392] on the profile and (hard) exclusion filters produced in this article. 

Why is the Craig Wright example relevant to cryptocurrency community and industry, in addition to 
the curiosity-driven search for the origins of Bitcoin? Apart from referring to himself as Satoshi Naka-
moto, Wright sues major crypto-stakeholders in court for calling him a fraud [103-108, 1414]. Maybe 
of significantly more practical relevance than the increasingly academic debate on his inventorship of 
Bitcoin after the blockchain community has transitioned into a life of its own, Wright has filed, and 
been issued,  numerous  intellectual  property rights for  potentially  important components  of block-
chain technology [109-111], which might hamper progress or jeopardize current and future projects 
in the field. 

Summary & Outlook 
This paper has discovered so far mostly overlooked, circumstantial “material” evidence around the 
origins of Bitcoin. The first revolves about the citation of a 1999 article published in the book of pro-
ceedings of a very local (networking) symposium in the Benelux, that was only available, at least before 
2008, as a hardcopy to attendees and a small number of libraries. Furthermore, the headline cited by 
Satoshi  Nakamoto  in  the  Bitcoin  genesis  block  was  only  available  in  the  UK-print  edition  of  “The 
Times”, but was phrased differently in its online, print-only international / US versions. Moreover, the 
citation  of  a  first,  1957-edition  of  a  standard  textbook  on  probability  theory  (8)  [711]  might  carry 
further cues about Satoshi Nakamoto, e.g., about a family tradition in mathematics, or a passion for 
historic associations. 

Just by the sheer capability of inventing and implementing Bitcoin in a code-first approach, Satoshi 
Nakamoto must have been an expert-level (C++) programmer versed in cryptography, electronic cash, 
decentralized peer-to-peer networks, cybersecurity, money, banking, law, a skill set possibly acquired 
in a prodigiously self-taught mode. Even preceding the very first appearance of his persona, Satoshi 
Nakamoto cunningly scoped and impressively delivered on a well-equipped, long-haul strategy, resort-
ing to privacy-focused internet providers and technologies, combined with strict, long-term sustained 
reticence, for constructing a (so far) impenetrable citadel for shielding his real identity. 
In addition to the suspicious citations (2) and (8) of the Bitcoin whitepaper, several somewhat free 
parameters that concern: the design of the Bitcoin blockchain, his stage name, nationality, his choice 
of English orthography and idioms, and certain dates that were (broadly) left to his discretion. Even 
more, his computing setup looks like he was (initially) running Microsoft Windows (XP) on rather low-
end hardware with the rarely used word processor OpenOffice (instead of LATEX), a somewhat odd 
package for a computer wizard, unless this was owing to a lack of financial means at the time, or a 
decoy. Satoshi Nakamoto was also not passionate, or capable, of generating eye-catching graphics. 

Deeper analysis, also considering time zones, linguistics, and IP addresses, remains somewhat incon-
clusive, indicating a person having British / Commonwealth provenance, substantial academic links to 
the Benelux, but also residence or stints across in the entire continental USA. Even beyond the pick of 
his  online  name,  a  noticeable  personal  connection  to,  or  passion  for  the  Japanese  culture  gleams 
through, possibly inspired by peers from Japan. Also traces of a penchant for history, strategic games, 
like Chess or Poker, and fun with geometries may be inferred from a coherent collection of evidence. 
Even though Satoshi Nakamoto never seems to have deposited directions to search for puzzles, such 
intention may actually be inferred from his enigmatic character, and the baffling twists and turns of 
his online life. Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto was an undercover entertainer? Hence, such compounding 
of cues indicates that at least  some hidden messages were  deliberately  arranged by Satoshi Naka-
moto. 

While each piece of the puzzle and its “exegesis” [794] might justifiably be challenged on an individual 
level, the striking accumulation of evidence around his pseudonym, the numbers 21 and 42, the binary 
system, and symbolism match well with a likely personality, as well as locations, dates and happenings 

that unfolded in politics, the economy, history, geography, culture, society, media, and sports related 
to Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin; this large stack of diverse findings unveils a very privacy conscious, 
reclusive, quite omniscient, multi-talented, autodidactic, charismatic, creative, idealistic, sometimes 
flippant,  “nerdy”,  slightly  unsociable,  and  rather  factually  oriented,  than  ideologically  evangelizing 
tech genius who might suffer from a (possibly faint) mental condition. 

Dovetailing these discoveries with the slew of preceding research on Satoshi Nakamoto amalgamates 
to a still hypothetical, but overwhelmingly consistent partial biography and psychogram of an intel-
lectually abundantly endowed, altruistic, sensitive and, at least in the eyes of the general public, erratic 
person with exceptional work ethic towards his libertarian-, possibly cypherpunk- minded ideals who 
is, by embodying this highly unique spectrum of traits, unprecedented in the history of science and 
technology. 

Even though not pursued in this work, the opulent diversity and (partial) inconsistency of certain infor-
mation might also be attributed to a confined group, e.g., with a shared track record in a federal or 
corporate cryptography department, or even an academic, entrepreneurial or family combo that con-
spired  for  the  development  of  Bitcoin,  possibly  coordinated  by  a  designated, de-facto  leader.  This 
assumption of an expert squad might also explain the unusual blend of primarily US-American, British, 
European and Far-Eastern artefacts attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto. However, a reference to a group, 
such  as  an  accidental  “we”  or  “us”,  has  never  (accidentally)  slipped  through  in  his  communication 
related to the creation of Bitcoin. 

From its outset, this work was not driven by pitching new or supporting existing names, or from infrin-
ging with the privacy of the real person(s) that has (so far) successfully perched behind the pseudonym 
Satoshi Nakamoto. Unsurprisingly, as the evidence discovered in the fabric of Bitcoin were deployed 
by  himself,  Satoshi  Nakamoto  would  hardly  have  deliberately  included  anything  that  unwraps  his 
shrewdly refined disguise of identity. His encrypted messages were mostly providing a peek into im-
portant happenings, his witty humor, and possibly exposing certain sentiments. In the final section, 
the compiled evidence was probed against a list of past nominations, and the cohort of candidates 
could be narrowed down significantly; however, as expected, contradictions remained, and a final call 
could thus not be made. 
This may be owing to the fact that the real Satoshi Nakamoto has not been screened, yet, as a candi-
date,  and  further,  dark-horse  candidates  may  surface;  the  real  Satoshi  Nakamoto  is  very  likely  to 
match the profile that unfolded in this article, resolve the apparent contradictions, and dismiss certain 
overinterpretations. Even in a dearth of such a “perfect fit”, the developed vita and psychogram can 
be employed to debunk false nominations, and also self-appointed “Faketoshis”; while the story draf-
ted here will certainly not hold in all its detail, possibly also because even simple explanations have 
fatally  been  overlooked,  good  arguments  would  have  to  be offered  for  deviations,  and  convincing 
alternatives would have to be presented in order to support any “Satoshi” hypothesis. 

The motivation and psychology of an identity-stealing Satoshi Nakamoto imposter, if not, for instance, 
a prank, cover-up alibi, or part of a con scheme, forms a complex topic of its own, presenting inter-
esting  facets,  like  a  gradually  increasing  believe  in  self-fabricated  story,  and  growing  identification 
through adoption of an alter ego [1424], resembling known cases [1425], e.g., in art [1426-1428] and 
history  [1429,  1430], most  prominently  around  the  Grand  Duchess  Anastasia  Nikolaevna  of  Russia 
(“Anastasia”) [1431]. A telediagnosis of a candidate is deemed impossible, but in psychology, there 
are dispositions [1432] referred to as fantasy prone personality (FPP) [1433], or dissociative identity 
disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder (MPD) [1434]. 

For now, the choice to apply the catalogue of characteristics excavated in this article to “Satoshi Naka-
moto” candidates is up to vexed readers. Rather than being driven by selling names, matches to the 
“1-in-a-billion” profile proposed here, with rather moderate and reclusive characters, should be con-

sidered. When coming under scrutiny, it is to be anticipated that the real Satoshi Nakamoto would 
bluntly refute his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, even deny their interest in electronic cash / 
cryptocurrencies, or just not even respond at all, and likely rebuke researchers for having fielded their 
name. 

Moreover, given his highly rational, unflustered, technical approach, it is unlikely that, if at all, Satoshi 
Nakamoto would step into the public without being able of producing compelling evidence for con-
vincingly  identifying  him  as  the  inventor  of  Bitcoin.  It  is  also  improbable  that  he  would  move  his 
(“Patoshi” [216, 374, 375]) BTC assets for conversion into fiat money [411] to a centralized exchange, 
and then transfer them to a regular, and thus know-your-customer (KYC) [1435] and anti-money laun-
dering (AML) [1436] monitored, and official proof-of-identity requiring bank account. 

After all, there seems to be no panacea or silver bullet for reaching finality on Satoshi Nakamoto’s real 
identity and aliveness, given that his private keys may have been, whether intentionally, accidentally, 
or forcefully, burned, physically destroyed, shared, or transferred within a cohort of creators, their 
families, entourage, or to externals. If Satoshi Nakamoto was not to step out, or in case he was inca-
pacitated, or even deceased, the paradox he left may never be resolved; in this, not so unlikely, case, 
the foundational mystery of Bitcoin may become an eternal conundrum akin to its historical prece-
dents, but in the digital age of information [874]. 

Unless it delivers inputs directly obtained from the true Satoshi Nakamoto, the author would perso-
nally stay highly skeptical whether brief articles can uncover Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity coup; they 
might still be very captivating, providing captivating entertainment, or a boiler room for candidates 
motivated by a wide range of possible objectives. 
The author believes that the ingenious mastermind of Bitcoin would nowadays be more than happy 
to chime in with the motto “We are all Satoshi!” For those who are desperately curious to uncover 
this very fascinating foundational mystery: “There’s more work to do …” [260].

Numerology 

Possibly just for the fun of it, Satoshi Nakamoto might also resorted to numerology [1465], which is 
the pseudoscientific belief in a divine or mystical relationship between a number, and one or more 
attributes.  It  is  also  the  study  of  the  numerical  value  of  the  letters  in  words,  names,  and  ideas. 
Numerology  is  often  associated  with  the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar to divinatory 
arts. 
While this connection is highly speculative, it is still interesting, or at least entertaining, to look at a 
rather abstruse article in advance of 11th anniversary of the registration of bitcoin.org on 18/08/2008 
[1466].  This  publication  establishes  a  relationship  between  Bitcoin  and  the  (undocumented) 
numerology  [1467]  of  the  Chaldean  or  Neo-Babylonian  Empire  [1468]:  “The  compound  number  of 
21/3 means that one wants to crack the code into gaining ultimate success that will be ever ongoing 
throughout one’s entire life. However, if it is unbalanced, one will have the feeling of often being close 
to the total success, but the success seems further away than initially anticipated. Therefore, if it’s 
unbalanced, one’s life might feel like walking through a tunnel of a constant learning process.”
