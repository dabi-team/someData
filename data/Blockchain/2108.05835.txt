Sharding-Based Proof-of-Stake Blockchain
Protocols: Security Analysis

Abdelatif Haﬁd, Abdelhakim Senhaji Haﬁd, Adil Senhaji,

Abstract—Blockchain technology has been gaining great interest from a variety of sectors, including healthcare, supply chain and
cryptocurrencies. However, Blockchain suffers from its limited ability to scale (i.e. low throughput and high latency). Several solutions
have been appeared to tackle this issue. In particular, sharding proved that it is one of the most promising solutions to Blockchain
scalability. Sharding can be divided into two major categories: (1) Sharding-based Proof-of-Work (PoW) Blockchain protocols, and (2)
Sharding-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Blockchain protocols. The two categories achieve a good performances (i.e. good throughput
with a reasonable latency), but raise security issues. This article attends that analyze the security of the second category. More
speciﬁcally, we compute the probability of committing a faulty block and measure the security by computing the number of years to fail.
Finally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct a numerical analysis and evaluate the results obtained.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the raise of Bitcoin [1], Blockchain has attracted sig-
niﬁcant attention and extensive research. More speciﬁcally,
it has been adopted by numerous and several applications,
such as healthcare [2], supply chain [3], and Internet-of-
Things [4]. However, Blockchain’s capacity to scale is very
limited [5]. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies,
Bitcoin [1] handles between 3-7 transactions per second
(tps), which is very limited compared to traditional payment
systems (e.g. PayPal [6]). To deal with this issues, many
solutions appeared [5]. In particular, sharding is emerged as
a promising solution [5]. Sharding consists of partitioning
the network into shanks, called shards; all shards work
in parallel to enhance the performance of the network
and then mitigate the scalability issues. More speciﬁcally,
each shard handles a sub-set of transactions instead of the
entire network handles all the transactions. However, the
security of sharding-based blockchain protocols is emerging
as a challenging issue. More speciﬁcally, in sharding-based
blockchain environment, it is easy for a malicious user to
conquer and attack a single shard compared to the whole
network. This attack is well-known as a shard takeovers
attack [7].

Malicious nodes (e.g. Sybil nodes) are increasingly ap-
pear with the growing and the spread of Blockchain technol-
ogy. In contract, several consensus mechanisms appeared to
deal with these Byzantine nodes, including, PoW, PoS, , and
practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT).

pBFT is an algorithm that tolerates Byzantine fault [8];
this algorithm belongs to the BFT class. Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (BFT) is the feature of a distributed network to
reach consensus (agreement on the same value) even when

some of nodes in the network fail to respond or respond
with incorrect information. Leslie Lamport [9] proved that
if we have 3m +1 correctly working processors, a consensus
(agreement on same value) can be reached if at most m
processors are faulty, which means strictly more than two-
thirds of the total number of processors should be honest.

PoS is an alternative consensus mechanism of PoW. It
consists of selecting validators in proportion to their number
of coins. Validators are responsible of adding new blocks to
Blockchain.

By going through the literature [5], [10], we can clas-
sify sharding-based Blockchain protocols into two major
categories: sharding-based PoW and sharding-based PoS
Blockchain protocols.

Recently, Haﬁd et al. [7], [11], [12] proposed many ap-
proaches and models to analyze the security of the ﬁrst cat-
egory. However, there is a lack of methods in the literature
to analyze the second category. In this paper, we focus on
the second category. Precisely, we provide a probabilistic
model to analyze the security of this kind of sharding-
based Blockchain protocols by computing the probability
of committing a faulty block. Furthermore, based on these
probabilities, we calculate the number of years to fail for the
purpose of quantifying and measuring the security of the
network.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section
2 presents an overview of sharding-based PoS Blockchain
protocols and presents the proposed probabilistic model.
Section 3 presents numerical results and evaluates the pro-
posed model. In the end, we conclude this paper in Section
4.

2 MATHEMATICAL MODEL

The objective of this section is to propose a probabilis-
tic model to analyze the security of sharding-based PoS
Blockchain protocols.

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Shard’s committee). Shard’s committee is
a subset of validators selected randomly from the set of
validators that are decided to stake for the shard chains.

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Beacon’s committee). Beacon’s committee
is a subset of validators selected randomly from the set of
validators that are decided to stake for the beacon chain.

2.2 Probabilistic Model

In this section, we present the proposed probabilistic model.
Figure 1 shows a network of sharding-based PoS Blockchain
protocol. The network contains a single beacon chain and ζ
shard chains. Shard chains forge/produce blocks in parallel.
All shard chains are synchronized by beacon chain. More
speciﬁcally, each shard has its own committee, which is
randomly assigned by the beacon chain. And each shard
committee processes transactions belonging to it. When a
shard block is created, the beacon committee verify the
block, if valid, it adds the block header to the beacon chain.
Otherwise, it drops it and sends the proof to other shards
to vote for the purpose of slashing the misbehaving shard
committee. Furthermore, in each epoch (a period of time),
beacon chain shufﬂes committees to ensure the security. For
Incognito [13], when a new random number is generated,
the beacon chain shufﬂes committees; this means that, one
epoch for Incognito is corresponding to generating a new
random number. This number is generated periodically in a
round-robin fashion [13], [14].

Lemma 2.2. The probability of at least 2
committing a faulty block (P

(cid:48)

) can be computed as follows:

Proof. The minimum of all shards’ committees to commit
a faulty block is 2ζ
3 , where ζ is the number of shards.
The probability of exactly 2ζ
3 all shards’ committees con-
ﬁrm/agree to add a faulty block can be summarized and
expressed as follows:

P 2ζ

(cid:18)

P (X ≥

(3)

And the probability to commit a faulty block by exactly
2ζ
3 + 1 of all shards’ committees can be described as follows.

P 2ζ

3 +1 =

(cid:18)

P (X ≥

2n

)

(cid:19) 2ζ

3 +1

(4)

Similarly, the probability of exactly ζ of all shards’ com-
mittees (the entire number of shards in this case) agree to
add a faulty block can be expressed as follows:

(cid:18)

Pζ =

P (X ≥

(cid:19)ζ

2n
3

)

(5)

A faulty block can be committed if 2ζ

3 + 2
or, · · · , or ζ of all shards’ committees agree to add this block.
This can be mathematically computed by the sum over all
these probabilities and can be expressed and summarized as
follows:

3 + 1 or 2ζ

3 or 2ζ

(cid:48)

P

= P 2ζ

+ P 2ζ

3 +1 + · · · + Pζ

Lemma 2.3. The probability of the beacon’s committee members
committing a faulty block (P

) can be expressed as follows:

Proofs of Lemma 2.1 and 2.2 are a direct results from the

cumulative hypergeometric distribution [7], [12].

committing a faulty block for a given shard can be expressed as

3 of all shards’ committees. This can
be identiﬁed mathematically by the product over the three
probabilities (the calculated probabilities in Lemmas 2.1, 2.2,
and 2.3).

3 RESULTS & EVALUATION
In Figures 2, 4, and 3, we assume a network with N = 2000
users/nodes, V = 200, V’= 400, r = 0.333, R = 0.1, R = 0.2, and
R = 0.3. The remaining parameters will be shown in Figures.
Figure 2 shows the probability of a shard to commit a
faulty block versus the size of the committee in a network
of 2000 nodes. We observe that the probability P decreases
when the size of the committee increases. More speciﬁcally,
we observe that the probability corresponding to R = 0.1
(i.e. 10% of malicious nodes in each shards) decreases
rapidly compared to those of R = 0.15 and R = 0.2; this can
be explained by the small percentage of malicious nodes.
In other words, as the percentage of malicious nodes gets
smaller the probability decreases and vice versa.

Figure 4 shows the probability of all shards committing
a faulty block versus the size of the committee. We observe
that the probability P
decreases when the size of the
committee increases.

Figure 3 shows the probability of the beacon chain to
commit a faulty block versus the size of the committee. We
observe that the probability P
decreases when the size

of the committee increases. More speciﬁcally, we observe
that the probability corresponding to R = 0.1 (i.e. 10% of
malicious nodes in each shards) decreases sharply compared
to those of R = 0.15 and R = 0.2.

In Figure 2, we assume two scenarios to show the effec-

shard as well as in the beacon chain. This achieves a good
security, which is about 1.74E + 17 years to fail.

To sum up, we conclude that by adjusting the size of the
shard’s committee as well as the size of the beacon’s com-
mittee, we could support/protect the sharded Blockchain
systems against malicious nodes (e.g. Sybil nodes).

4 CONCLUSION

This article addresses the security of sharding-based
blockchain protocols that are based on PoS and pBFT con-
sensuses. In particular, it provides a probabilistic model to
compute the probability of committing a faulty block. Based
on this probability, we compute the number of years to fail.
Furthermore, this article depicts that we can control the
number of years to fail by adjusting the size of the shard’s
committee as well as the size of the beacon’s committee.
Future works focus on computing the failure probability
across-shard transaction.

tiveness and the feasibility of the proposed model: Scenario
1 proposes a network with N = 2000, ζ = 8, V = 200,
V (cid:48) = 400, and r = r(cid:48) = 0.333 whereas Scenario 2 proposes
a network with N = 4000, ζ = 8, V = 400, V (cid:48) = 800, and
r = r(cid:48) = 0.333. It is noteworthy that the proposed model
can be adopted to any scenario.

Table 2 shows the probability of conquering the chain
(i.e. the probability of committing a faulty block; it is cal-
culated based on Theorem 2.1) for different percentage of
malicious nodes in the shards as well as in the beacon
chain. Moreover, Table 2 shows the number of years to fail
corresponding to these probabilities. More speciﬁcally, we
observe that as the percentage of malicious nodes increases
the number of years to fail decreases.

We observe that the probability of conquering the chain
is extremely low even with 20% of malicious nodes in each
