transportation  systems.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a result of 
the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicular 
Ad-Hoc  Networks (VANETs). IoV offers  ubiquitous  access 
to information to drivers and passengers while on the move 
[1]. IoV has many promising applications such as intelligent 
traffic optimization [2], sensor-based accident prediction [3], 
entertainment  content  delivery  [4],  and  electric  vehicle 
charging  scheduling  [5].  However,  with  the  fast-growing 
number of connected vehicles, IoV requirements are difficult 
to satisfy, e.g. secure, scalable, robust, seamless information 
exchange among vehicles, users, and roadside infrastructures. 
Blockchain [6], a distributed and immutable tamper-resistant 
ledger, manages persistence records of data at different nodes 
and has the potential to deal with the data security and privacy 
challenges  in  IoV  networks.    As  shown  in  Figure  1,  the 
application of Blockchain to IoV can be roughly divided into 
four  classes,  namely  security,  privacy,  trust  computing  and 
incentive  mechanisms.  For  security,  Blockchain  can  be 
leveraged  to  solve  the  problems  of  traditional  vehicular 
network  security  issues,  such  as  Public  key  infrastructure 
(PKI)-based  solutions  and  ID-based  solutions.  Similarly, 
Blockchain-enabled  privacy  schemes  for  IoV  ensure  the 
identification of the privacy of the participating vehicles and 
their  locations.  Blockchain  can  also  serve  as  a  distributed 
reputation  system  that  stores  vehicles’  trust  scores  or  store 
vehicle  generated  content.  Finally,  Blockchain  can  also  be 
used to manage traffic-related cryptocurrencies for rewarding 
vehicles  that  helped  the  system.    In  this  paper,  we  review 
recent  literature  on  blockchain  applications  in  IoV  and 
intelligent transportation systems in general.

II.   BLOCKCHAIN FOR IOV TRUST MANAGEMENT 

Trust management refers to the methods that estimate the 
trustworthiness of other entities in the system. Based on the 
likelihood  of  trustworthiness  assigned  to  a  given  entity,  the 
system decides whether to interact with that arbitrary entity or 
not. The concept of trust is paramount in systems security, and 
it  is  discussed  extensively  in  the  network  security  literature 
[7].  In  the  context  of  vehicular  networks,  when  the  vehicle 
receives a message, the trust system must check the legitimacy 
and trustworthiness of the sender (node trust), as well as the 
trustworthiness  of  the  received  data  or  information  (content 
trust).  Considering  the  nature  of  vehicular  networks,  trust 
management plays a vital role in preventing network attacks 
that may cause serious consequences. For instance, in a safety 
related  VANET  application  of  emergency  warning,  the 
application decides to operate the emergency brakes in case of 
a  nearby  accident  or  road  obstacle.  When  the  emergency 
application receives a warning message from other nodes, it is 
up to the trust management system to evaluate the trust level 
of information, as well as the legitimacy and trustworthiness 
of the sender. In such a delay-sensitive application, the trust 
management system should immediately decide  whether the 

 
 
 
 
warning  message  is coming  from  a  legitimate  node and the 
information is correct, or from a malicious vehicle for selfish 
purposes.    Following  the  concluded  decision,  the  trust 
management system announces the decision to the emergency 
application, the latter either operates the brake if the message 
was trusted or ignores the message and reports the sender to 
the  trust  authority  in  case  of  fake  content.  Since  the 
conventional  security  mechanisms,  such  as  cryptography, 
access  control  and  authentication,  cannot  be  used  to  detect 
dishonest nodes or fake messages, a trust management system 
is necessary to guarantee the security of the network and it is 
supposed  to  complement  the  other  security  measures  of 
vehicular networks.  

There are many trust management methods that guarantee 
the  trustworthiness  of  network  nodes  in  MANET  [8]. 
However,  due  to  the  special  characteristics  of  VANET,  the 
MANET  trust  management  schemes  cannot  be  adopted  for 
VANET,  which  need  more  efficient  and  scalable  methods. 
Due  to  the  high  mobility  of  the  VANET  nodes,  and  the 
frequent  changing  of  the  network  topology,  it  is  difficult  to 
maintain  the  same  set  of  neighbours  for  a  long  time.  This 
requires  the  trust  management  system  to  estimate  the  trust 
level of a giving node immediately after their short encounter, 
rather  than  maintaining  a  trust  index  of  long-lasting  cluster 
trust 
the 
neighbours  and  updating 
management in MANET. Vehicular nodes are more likely to 
meet  with  other  nodes  that  they  have  never  encountered 
before, and cannot wait until they meet these nodes again to 
update their trust level, therefore trust bootstrapping is crucial 
in VANET [9]. Vehicular nodes need to cooperate to maintain 
a  global  trust  management  system,  and  depend  on  other 
sources, such as social networks, to estimate the trust level. 

index, 

trust 

like 

in  vehicular  networks. 

Blockchain-based  trust  management  system  leverages 
blockchain  properties  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  trust 
management 
  The  blockchain 
decentralization property ensures that all the vehicular nodes 
participate in the computation and storage of the global trust 
records. This eliminates the need for a central trust authority 
that stores and updates trust records. The availability property 
ensures  that  the  trust  management  system  could  still  work 
even  in  the  presence  of  failure  of  any  vehicle.  The 
immutability  property  guarantees  that  stored  trust  levels  are 
not  changeable  unless  the  vehicular  community  agrees  to 
update  some  of  them  by  adding  new  transactions,  hence 
malicious vehicles cannot tamper with their trust value on the 
blockchain.    The  transparency  property  gives  the  chance  to 
any  vehicle  the  ability  to  fetch  any  trust  record  if  needed. 
Zhang  et  al.  [10]  introduced  a  blockchain-based  trust 
management framework for IoV, the proposed system uses a 
reputation-based rating scheme to evaluate the trustworthiness 
of the vehicles and RSU. The vehicles rate the correctness of 
the  received  message  and  upload  their  rating  to  the  RSU 
community,  the  latter  computes  the  reputation  value  of  the 
nodes  who  declare  this  event  and  update  their  reputation 
values in the blockchain. In case of a false message, the system 
decreases the reputation value of the malicious node, which 
weakens  its  influence  in  future  decisions.  A  PoW  and  PoS 
hybrid consensus algorithm is used to guarantee that the high-
reputed  vehicles  have  the  priority  to  update  the  blockchain, 
and smart contracts are used to ensure that the RSU computes 
the reputation scores according to the transparent rules. It is 
worth noting that the blockchain is stored only on the RSU, 
not  on  the  vehicles.    Similarly,  Yang  et  al  [11]  proposed  a 
blockchain-based  distributed  trust  management  system  that 

leverages Bayesian Inference Model to evaluate the upcoming 
messages from the neighbouring nodes. The RSU community 
aggregates  the  ratings  from  vehicles  and  collaboratively 
compute the trust value offsets; these trust values are grouped 
into  blocks  and  stored  in  the  blockchain.  This  also  uses  a 
hybrid  PoW  and  PoS  consensus  algorithm,  where  the  more 
total  value  of  the  trust  offsets  (PoS),  the  easier  RSU  can 
compute the nonce of the hash function (PoW).  

In the same vein, Liu et al [12] used a conditional privacy-
preserving  announcement  method  to  propose  a  blockchain-
based  trust  management  system,  called  (BTCPS).  BTCPS 
leverages  identity-based  group  signature  schemes  to  ensure 
conditional  privacy,  in  case  of  fake  message  dissemination, 
the trusted authority can unveil the identity of the malicious 
vehicle through anonymous announcements of the designated 
public  address.  RSUs  cooperate  to  maintain  a  distributed 
ledger that contains the trust value of each vehicle. When an 
event  is  detected,  the  source  vehicle  calls  nearby  nodes  as 
witnesses  to  confirm  the  event.  In  case  of  approval,  the 
witnesses  reply  with  a  response  message  that  contains  the 
signatures of these vehicles, the initiator sends the aggregated 
signatures  package  to  the  nearest  RSU  for  verification.  The 
RSU uses logistic regression to compute the trust values of the 
initiator and verify the message. After updating the trust value 
of the initiator (increase it in case of a true message or decrease 
it in case of a fake message), the elected minor RSU packs the 
new  values  into  a  block  and  tries  to  add  the  new  block  by 
providing the block ID, RSU ID, block generation timestamp, 
previous block’s hash and the nonce. Some authorized RSUs 
are responsible to perform the consensus using a hybrid PoW 
and PBFT algorithm. Wang et al [13]  proposed a blockchain-
based  trustworthiness  computing  system  named  (B-TSCA), 
where the RSUs validate the trustworthiness of the vehicles 
through consensus, B-TSCA uses Merkle hash tree (MHT) to 
implement real-time audit of vehicle attributes, such as trust 
level.  Javaid  et  al  [14]  presented  a  blockchain-based  trust 
management system that uses a physical unclonable function 
(PUF) to assign unique identifiers to each vehicular node and 
smart contract along with  a dynamic proof-of-work (dPoW) 
consensus  algorithm  to  store  the  nodes’  trust  scores  in  the 
blockchain.  Kouicem  et  el.  [15]  introduced  BC-Trust,  a 
blockchain-based trust management system for highly mobile 
devices,  where  the  network  nodes  disseminate  trust  ratings 
about service providers to the blockchain. Hence, all the nodes 
can access trust information about any service provider. Singh 
et  al  [16]  presented  a  blockchain-based  distributed  trust 
management system using smart contracts. They leverage the 
concept  of  blockchain  sharding  to  decrease  the  computing 
overhead  on  the  blockchain  and  increase  the  transaction 
throughput.  The  proposed  system  uses  an 
incentive 
mechanism to encourage vehicles to report fake messages, the 
reward  points  could  be  spent  to  benefit  from  vehicular 
services,  such  as  insurance  and  maintenance.  Dhelim  et  al. 
[17]–[22] discussed trust computing in the context of IoP and 
its applications in recommendation systems and user interest 
mining.  Similarly,  Ning  et  al.  [23]–[26]  studied  trust 
computing in cyber-physical mapping systems.

III.  BLOCKCHAIN FOR IOV PRIVACY 

     Privacy  is  one  of  the  main  requirements  of  IoV,  the 
privacy of the vehicles or the information exchanged among 
vehicles  should  be  preserved  and  revealed  only  to  the 
the  security  measures  can 
authorized  entities.  While 
guarantee  authorized  access  to  the  vehicle's  identity  and 
exchanged  messages,  the  challenge  of  privacy-preserving 
schemes is to maintain a balance between security level and 
accessibility.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  in  the  context  of 
VANET,  there  are  three  main  types  of  privacy-preserving 
schemes:  a)  identification  privacy  methods  refer  to  the 
techniques  used  to  prevent  unauthorized  entities  from 
knowing  the  identity  of  the  vehicle  itself  or  its  driver.  b) 
location privacy methods aim to hide the location information 
of the vehicles from unauthorized entities, including the GPS 
coordinates  of  the  current  location,  as  well  as  the  travelled 
path. c) content privacy methods aim to hide the metadata and 
properties  of  exchange  messages,  such  as  bacon  messages. 
Many  authentication  schemes  have  been  proposed  for 
VANET.  To  preserve  the  identity  of  the  vehicles,  these 
schemes leverage public key infrastructure, group signature, 
cryptography,  identity-based  signature,  or  certificate-less 
signature,  to  name  a  few.  These  schemes  depend  on  a 
centralized TA that initiates pre-set trust connection with the 
vehicles.  The  trust relationship is no longer  valid  when the 
vehicle drives to another region. To solve this issue, previous 
the  deployment  of  cross-domain 
research  suggested 
authentication  [32],  which  requires  various  communication 
between  vehicles,  RSUs  and  TA,  which  could  cause 

communication delays. Not to mention the additional work of 
protecting the centralized TA from attacks such as DoS and 
DDoS. The blockchain is a distributed technology that offers 
the possibility for decentralized privacy-preserving solutions.  
Shen  et  al  [33]  introduced  a  blockchain  privacy-preserving 
LBS  protocol  for  vehicular  social  networks  (VSN).  They 
designed  a  lightweight  threshold  certification  scheme,  in 
which the proxy signing keys are issued by a set of CAs that 
act  as  authorized  consortium  blockchain  nodes.  Without 
any CA intervention, any vehicle can authenticate its identity 
by  its  blockchain  address.  Lu  et  al  [34]  used  a  blockchain-
based  solution  to  attain  conditional  privacy,  where  the 
vehicular nodes apply multiple certificates. The link between 
the real identity of the vehicle and the certificates is encrypted 
and securely stored in the blockchain and it can be revealed 
only  by  the  law  enforcement  authority  (LEA)  in  case  of  a 
dispute. Feng et al [35] introduced a blockchain-based trusted 
cloaking  area  construction  (TCAC)  method  based  on  trust 
management  to  preserve  the  location  privacy  of  vehicular 
nodes. The trust values are managed by combining vehicular 
regions  partition,  aiming  to  rapidly  evaluate  trust  ratings 
during  the  cloaking  area  construction.    George  et  al  [36] 
presented  a  blockchain-based  identity  privacy  framework, 
where the authentication parties (AP) maintain and update the 
blockchain.  The  AP  generates  the  public  and  private  keys 
along  with  a  pseudo-ID  for  the  vehicle  and  insert  the 
transaction into the shared blockchain. Makhdoom et al. [37] 
proposed  a  content  privacy  solution  based  on  blockchain, 
where  the  blockchain  network  is  divided  into  multiple 
channels,  and  each  channel  contains  a  limited  number  of 
authorized  entities  that  operate  special  sector.  The  access 
control rules to the data are defined by smart contracts stored 
in the blockchain.

IV.  BLOCKCHAIN FOR IOV SECURITY 

for  V2I  communication 

Traditional  vehicular  network  security  scheme  depends 
highly  on  centralized  server  architecture.  Public  key 
infrastructure  (PKI)-based  solutions  need  a  certificate 
verification  centralized  authority,  similarly, 
ID-based 
solutions required a key generation server. The former has the 
drawback  of  complicated  certificate  management,  which  is 
not suitable for IoV network. While the latter is prone to key 
escrow problems. Combining the two methods may mitigate 
the problem, but it is difficult to scale up hybrid solutions in 
practice.  Blockchain  was  proposed  as  a  solution  to  this 
problem. Ali et al [56] introduced Certificateless Public Key 
Signature (CL-PKS) which aims to reduce the computational 
overhead  of  signature  verification  and  generation.  CL-PKS 
leverages  a  bilinear  pairing  to  offer  conditional  privacy-
preserving  authentication 
in 
VANETs.  CL-PKS  scheme  also  offers  batch  signature 
management and gathering signature verification functions to 
scale  up  the  signature  generation  and  verification  process. 
Blockchain  is  used  to  execute  revocation  transparency  of 
pseudo-identities  prior  to  signature  verifying.    Li  et  al  [57] 
combined  ciphertext-based  attribute  encryption  (CP-ABE) 
and block to proposed FADB, an access control scheme for 
VANET data based on blockchain. Specifically, they utilized 
user attributes to define access rights  for VANET services, 
which improved the performance of CP-ABE. Furthermore, 
the lightweight vehicle attached devices can outsource heavy 
encryption  and  decryption  tasks  to  powerful  RSUs  and 
further enhance the efficiency of the data access mechanism.

the  vehicles  establish  trust

Vehicles send trust values to the RSUs, which execute PBFT

Li et al [58] proposed a consortium blockchain-based secure 
authentication  and  key  management  method  for  VANET.

Blockchain applications in IoV are not limited only 
to  security  and  privacy.  Blockchain  can  be  used  as  an 
incentive  system  to  reward  vehicles  in  exchange  for  their 
participation in a given task, such as reporting traffic events, 
taking  longer  paths  or  choosing  a  non-congested  electric 
charging station. Sankar et al  [59] proposed CreditCoin, an 
incentive  coin  for  VANET  vehicles,  which  leverages  a 
stimulus portion based on the Blockchain. Where drivers gain 
or  invest  coins  when  driving  powers,  they  track  legendary 
focuses.  Furthermore,  CreditCoin  does  jam  protection  and 
keeps  the  network  safe  by  using  vehicles’  computational 
power  to  prevent  malicious  attacks.    Under  the  same  name 
(CreditCoin)  Li  et  al 
incentive 
announcement network based on Blockchain that aggregates 
vehicular  announcements.  CreditCoin  enables  different 
drivers  to  create  the  signatures  and  to  send  announcements 
anonymously  in  a  non-trusted  environment.  Furthermore, 
CreditCoin  motivates  drivers  with  incentives  to  share  the 
traffic  information,  which  makes  transactions  and  drivers’ 
information 
that 
CreditCoin  can  fulfil  conditional  privacy  requirements  and 
motivate  users  to  forward  announcements  reliably  and 
anonymously.  Vishwakarma  and  Das  proposed  SmartCoin 
[60],  a  consortium  blockchain-based  incentive  mechanism, 
where vehicles rate message source vehicles according to the 
validity  and  importance  of  the  message.  To  reward  useful 
messages, gained SmartCoins are transferred to the vehicle's 
account  in  the  blockchain.  The  SmartCoins  can  be  spent 
either  at  an  electric  charge  station  for  electric  vehicles  and 
vehicle service stations, or a fuel station. Similarly, Khalid et 
al [61] introduced an incentive scheme that offers monetary 
incentives  for  vehicles  that  report  traffic-related  events.  In 
their  proposed  system,  RSUs  verify  and  aggregate  packets 
sent by vehicular nodes, and store the information related to 
traffic events in Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The first 
vehicle that initiates an event and reports gets rewarded after 
signature verification by RSUs. Aung et al [62] proposed T-
Coin, an incentive currency used to reward drivers that opt to 
take longer paths to mitigate traffic congestion.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

In  this  paper,  we  have  reviewed  recent  literature  on 
blockchain  applications  in  the  IoV.  Blockchain  can  be 
leveraged  to  solve  security  challenges  in  IoV  and  ensure 
identification  privacy  as  well  as  location  privacy  of  the 
participating vehicles. Furthermore, Blockchain can also be 
used to manage traffic-related cryptocurrencies for rewarding 
vehicles  that  help  the  system.  However,  Blockchain-based 
solutions  still  face  several  challenges,  such  as  high  energy 
consumption  in  case  of  PoW  consensus,  block  transitions 
limit, and block management overhead.
