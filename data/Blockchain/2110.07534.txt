ABSTRACT
The continuing expansion of the blockchain ecosystems has
attracted much attention from the research community. How-
ever, although a large number of research studies have been
proposed to understand the diverse characteristics of indi-
vidual blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum), lit-
tle is known at a comprehensive level on the evolution of
blockchain ecosystems at scale, longitudinally, and across
multiple blockchains. We argue that understanding the dy-
namics of blockchain ecosystems could provide unique in-
sights that cannot be achieved through studying a single
static snapshot or a single blockchain network alone. Based
on billions of transaction records collected from three repre-
sentative and popular blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum
and EOSIO) over 10 years, we conduct the first study on the
evolution of multiple blockchain ecosystems from different
perspectives. Our exploration suggests that, although the
overall blockchain ecosystem shows promising growth over
the last decade, a number of worrying ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù exist that
have disrupted its evolution.

1 INTRODUCTION
It has been over 12 years since blockchain was invented to
serve as the public transaction ledger of Bitcoin [1]. Since,
blockchain technologies have evolved significantly. This in-
cludes hundreds of public blockchain platforms, thousands
of cryptocurrencies [11], tens of thousands of decentralized
applications (DApps) and blockchain-based services [36],

1

millions of smart contracts [39], hundreds of millions of user
accounts [21], and billions of transactions [35]. These tech-
nologies and entities have formed a symbiotic relationship,
which we refer to as the blockchain ecosystem.

The global blockchain economy is estimated to be worth
1.8 trillion USD at the end of May 2021 [11]. As a result, its
continuing evolution has increased its complexity, which
itself needs considerable effort to understand: particularly its
characteristics, operations, trends and security issues.

Due to this, the blockchain ecosystem has attracted a lot
of attention from the research community. A large number
of studies have focused on exploring the characteristics of
blockchain networks [25, 42, 60], detecting attacks and vul-
nerabilities [24, 45, 56], deanonymizing users and tracking
money-flow [19, 48, 49, 58], and so on. However, little is
known (at a comprehensive level) on the evolution of the
overall blockchain ecosystem. Although several prior studies
have performed measurement studies on transactions and
smart contracts, they characterize activities based on either
a static snapshot [25], or based on a single platform [24, 42].
For example, Chen et al. [24] and Huang et al. [42] character-
ized Ethereum and EOSIO, respectively, based on large-scale
transaction analysis. To the best of our knowledge, no ex-
isting studies have characterized the evolution of blockchain
ecosystems comprehensively at scale, longitudinally and across
multiple representative platforms.

This Work. To fill this gap, we perform a multi-dimensional

and large-scale study covering all of the transactions on three

 
 
 
 
 
 
of the most representative blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum
and EOSIO. Bitcoin is the first distributed blockchain imple-
mentation. Ethereum is the second largest blockchain system
after Bitcoin, and the first second-generation blockchain plat-
form that supports smart contract functionality [22]. EOSIO
claims to be the third-generation blockchain, and adopts Del-
egate Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus, which significantly
improves throughput and enables new applications [29, 54].
We first collect the largest ever dataset across these three
platforms (see ¬ß3), with over 35 billion traces in total. We use
this dataset to provide a high-level characterization and tem-
poral analysis of the three platforms (¬ß4), including assess-
ing the behavior of money transfers (¬ß5), account creation
(¬ß6) and contract invocation (¬ß7). Following this, we explore
‚Äúoutliers‚Äù across the evolution of the three blockchains. We
identify these as either misbehavior by attackers or highly
popular ‚Äúkiller‚Äù DApps that trigger major fluctuations in ac-
tivity (¬ß8). Among many interesting results, the following
are the most prominent:

‚Ä¢ The overall blockchain ecosystem has shown significant
growth over the last decade. Ethereum and EOSIO are on
their way to becoming key decentralized systems, fea-
turing powerful and popular DApps. Bitcoin has shown
a steady upward trend, with the number of transac-
tions rising 15K times over 12 years. The number of
transactions in Ethereum and EOSIO rose 7.6K times
and 2.2K times, respectively. However, along with this
growth in the number of transactions, the proportion
of money transferred has dropped to 16.5% and 15.1%
for Ethereum and EOSIO till Nov. 2019, while the pro-
portion of smart contract invocation has reached over
80%. Smart contracts and DApps are therefore becom-
ing increasingly popular.

‚Ä¢ Many activities in the blockchain ecosystem follow the
Pareto principle across their evolution, and we are wit-
nessing increasing centralization. For all three types of
activities, i.e., money transfer, account creation, and
contract invocation, the Pareto principle is followed
(across all blockchains). This applies to every month
we analyze, indicating that a small group of accounts
are increasingly controlling the entire network.

‚Ä¢ Interactions among smart contracts are increasingly pop-
ular. During the development of Ethereum and EOSIO,
the emergence of ‚Äúkiller‚Äù DApps has led to geater in-
teractions between smart contracts. In other words,
contract invocation transactions are more likely to be
initiated by another smart contract than by a human.
However, Ethereum and EOSIO show quite different
behaviors regarding to the DApp evolution. For ex-
ample, in Ethereum, the explosion of Decentralized
Finance (DeFi) DApps accounts for over 1/3 of contract

invocations since Mar. 2020. In contrast, nearly half of
(49.04%) EOSIO contract invocation transactions were
related to gambling DApps.

‚Ä¢ 87 ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù are identified from our time-series analysis.
These have a significant impact that either facilitates or
impedes the progress of the blockchain ecosystem. 48 of
these are due to emerging DApps, while 39 of them
are introduced by attacks or scams.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudi-
nal and large-scale study across these three-generations of
blockchain. Our results motivate the need for further re-
search efforts. Particularly, we argue it is necessary to mea-
sure and mitigate the widely unexplored trends and misbe-
haviors of these blockchain technologies.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Blockchain and its Evolution
Blockchain has a history spanning 12 years. Bitcoin, as the
first platform that utilized blockchain, is widely called Blockchain
1.0. Following the growth of cryptocurrencies, users started
to explore the possibility of decentralized applications (DApps).
This led to the development of Ethereum. As a representa-
tive system of Blockchain 2.0, Ethereum is widely adopted by
developers. In fact, millions of smart contracts have already
been deployed on Ethereum. However, the performance of
Ethereum is limited by its consensus protocol (Proof-of-
Work, PoW). As a result, in 2018, EOSIO came online, which
adopts Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus. This has
been termed Blockchain 3.0, improving transaction through-
put significantly. To boost performance, Ethereum 2.0 (Phase
0 test) has also adopted Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in
Dec. 2020. Although many kinds of other blockchain sys-
tems have emerged, we believe these three blockchains are the
most representative and popular ones, making them ideal for
studying the evolution of the overall blockchain ecosystem.

2.2 Bitcoin, Ethereum and EOSIO
We next briefly compare the working mechanisms of Bitcoin,
Ethereum and EOSIO, as summarized in Table 1.

2.2.1 Record-Keeping Models. Two types of record-keeping
models are adopted in existing blockchain networks. The
first method is called the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Out-
put) Model [37], and the second one is the Account/Balance
Model [57]. Bitcoin is the only one that adopts the UTXO
model, which is illustrated in Fig. 17a in the Appendix ¬ßA.
Specifically, each transaction is composed of a set of inputs
and outputs, which all correspond to a certain amount of
Bitcoin. The UTXO model ensures that the sum of amount
represented by inputs is equal to the outputs. Moreover, each
output is locked by a scriptPubKey. Only the one with the

corresponding public key can unlock the output and spend
the money by an input. Therefore, in this paper, we refer to
each of the inputs and outputs as ùëùùë¢ùëèùëòùëíùë¶.

However, Bitcoin suffers from several drawbacks: 1) the
script in Bitcoin is not Turing-complete [6], which means
it cannot perform more sophisticated functions (e.g., smart
contracts); 2) due to its consensus algorithm, the transactions
per second (TPS) is low; and 3) UTXOs are stateless and
can be executed in parallel, which is not well suited for
many applications. Therefore, Ethereum and EOSIO adopt
the Account/Balance model. It works similarly to a debit card
transaction: the bank, equivalent to a consensus algorithm,
tracks the balance of each debit card to make sure enough
money exists before approving the transaction.

2.2.2 Accounts and Smart Contracts. In Ethereum, there are
two types of accounts: External Owned Accounts (EOA) and
smart contracts. Smart contracts contain immutable and exe-
cutable bytecode, while an EOA does not and is controlled
directly by a private key. A smart contract can be created
by either EOA or another smart contract. In contrast, the
smart contract in EOSIO is updatable. That is because an
executable smart contract‚Äôs bytecode in EOSIO is equivalent
to an attribute of an account, like one‚Äôs balance. Therefore, in
EOSIO, one can easily update the smart contract in accounts
he/she owns after paying the required cost.

2.2.3 Transactions. Accounts in Ethereum and EOSIO can
interact with each other by invoking transactions, including
money transfers, invoking contracts, or creating an account.
In Ethereum, the transactions initiated by EOA and smart
contracts are termed external transaction and internal trans-
action, respectively. In EOSIO, a transaction consists of one
or more action(s) and an action can be invoked by an account.
To better illustrate the working mechanisms, we depict the
process of transferring tokens between accounts in Ethereum
and EOSIO in Fig. 18 (see Appendix ¬ßA). Specifically, when
ùëéùëêùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë°ùëé transfers 1 Ether to ùëéùëêùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë°ùëè, it initiates a trans-
action with an empty input field and 1 Ether filled in the
value field. Specifically, the data in the input field can be
parsed by the recipient as a function signature with the cor-
responding parameters, and the value indicates the attached
Ether. The situation in EOSIO is more complicated. An offi-
cial smart contract, named eosio.token, issues EOS tokens

3

and maintains a balance table for all holders. If ùëéùëêùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë°ùëé
intends to transfer EOS to ùëéùëêùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë°ùëè, it has to request the
eosio.token to update the corresponding rows. After up-
dating, the eosio.token would immediately notify both of
them that the transfer request is handled properly. Once
ùëéùëêùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë°ùëè received the notification, it would perform the fol-
lowing movements, e.g., initiating another action to others.
Note that, when someone intends to create an account, they
need to request another official account (called eosio) to per-
form the action, instead of transferring an arbitrary amount
of EOS to a non-existent address like in Ethereum.

2.2.4 Consensus Protocol & Resource Model. The main dif-
ference between EOSIO and the other two platforms is the
consensus protocol and the resource model. PoW requires
miners to calculate a string of meaningless hash values which
must be preceded by a certain number of zero. Therefore, the
longer the prefix of zeros, the more calculation is required,
which leads to higher delays and resource-consumption. In
contrast, the DPoS is more resource‚Äìconservative and ef-
ficient. Compared to PoW, the theoretic TPS in EOSIO is
hundreds-fold, reaching up to 1000+.

Bitcoin and Ethereum adopt a similar resource model,
i.e., transaction fees and gas. Both are used to incentivize
miners to pack the transactions with the highest transaction
fee or gas. In EOSIO, the resources are named as CPU and
NET, which represent the allowed time to execute an action,
and the space can be occupied within a single transaction.
However, these two types of resource do not charge anything
from initiators. They can mortgage a certain amount of EOS
in exchange for CPU and NET, which can be reused in each
transaction. Note that, the price of CPU fluctuates according
to the total value of mortgaged EOS for CPU, and NET can be
freely used if some is available. In other words, the resource
price in EOSIO is nearly free in normal conditions.

3 DATA COLLECTION
3.1 Methodology
To obtain all transactions across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EO-
SIO, we deploy their official clients to synchronize data, i.e.,
Bitcoin Core [20], OpenEthereum [50], and nodeos [33]. To
conduct a fine-grained analysis, we also collect all traces,
i.e., internal transactions in Ethereum and actions in EOSIO

(see ¬ß2.2.3). As the traces are too large to crawl directly from
mainstream browsers (like etherscan [34]), we collect them by
replaying each transactions. Specifically, trace_transaction in
the trace module of OpenEthereum takes a transaction as an
input, and replays it to collect all internal transactions that
result from the given transaction. For obtaining actions in
EOSIO, we take advantage of the approach proposed by [42]
to customize the core service daemon (nodeos) to accelerate
the data collection process.

To facilitate our analysis of major events across the blockchains

(see ¬ß8), we further crawl the available information (i.e, name,
category, and corresponding addresses or accounts) of all
DApps from three well-known platforms: DAppTotal [32],
DappRadar [30], and DappReview [31].

3.2 Dataset Overview
3.2.1 Dataset. In total, we have collected over 35 Billion
traces. Table 2 summarizes the dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the largest ever dataset studied in the
research community. The trace is the basic unit of transaction
in each blockchain. For Bitcoin, a trace is an input or an
output; for Ethereum, traces are composed of all the external
transactions, as well as the internal ones; for EOSIO, a trace
corresponds to an action.

Obviously, although EOSIO has the latest launch time, the
numbers of traces and blocks are much higher than the other
two blockchains. As Bitcoin adopted UTXO model, which
does not have the concept of account, the number of Bitcoin
accounts indicates the distinct pubkeys of inputs and outputs.
In Bitcoin, an entity may have multiple pubkeys to avoid
reuse (to protect anonymity). Thus, the number of accounts
in Bitcoin is tens of Ethereum‚Äôs and hundreds of EOSIO‚Äôs.
Moreover, we can observe a significant distinction in the
number of accounts and smart contracts between Ethereum
and EOSIO. As explained in ¬ß2.2.2, this is because: 1) creating
an account in EOSIO charges not only transaction fee; and
2) EOSIO smart contract is updatable. Both of them impede
the explosion of the number of accounts in EOSIO.

Figure 1: The evolution of traces on a monthly basis.

3.2.2 General Trends. Fig. 1 shows the number of traces
collected on a monthly basis, and the corresponding Trans-
action per Second (TPS). The numbers of traces in all three
platforms have an upward trend. Interestingly, it only took
EOSIO three months to catch up and overtake the other two
platforms. However, it took Ethereum almost three years to
surpass Bitcoin. Compared to the relatively steady growth of
Bitcoin, Ethereum and EOSIO experience sudden increases.
For example, in Oct. 2016, the TPS of Ethereum reached up
to 73.0, around 15.9 times higher than the previous month.
Interestingly, this explosive growth was actually due to a
DoS [44] attack, which far exceeded the theoretical TPS it
could handle. As for EOSIO, the TPS reached over 1,240 in
Nov. 2019, and finally reached over 3,080. This resulted from
the launch of a spam DApp, which will be detailed in ¬ß8.4.1.

4 GRAPH-BASED EVOLUTION ANALYSIS
4.1 Method
We seek to characterize the evolution of the blockchain
ecosystems by investigating three representative behaviors:
money transfers, account creation, and contract invocation,
corresponding to the types of interactions between accounts
(see ¬ß2.2.3). To this end, we represent these activities in three
graph structures: the Money Transfer Graph (MTG), Account
Creation Graph (ACG), and Contract Invocation Graph (CIG).
For each blockchain platform, we will denote each graph
using its first three lowercase letters in subscript, e.g., ùê∂ùêºùê∫ùëèùë°ùëê
for Bitcoin. We build these three types of graphs on a monthly
basis and specify the month (formatted as ùë¶ùë¶ùë¶ùë¶ ‚àí ùëÄùëÄ) in
superscript, e.g., ùê∂ùêºùê∫ 2019‚àí10
. Overall, we have created 372
graphs (135 for Bitcoin, 171 for Ethereum and 66 for EOSIO).

ùëèùë°ùëê

4.2 Metrics and Notations
Following previous studies [24, 42], we measure the graphs
using the following four metrics. For each graph, we later
inspect each of these metrics in-turn. Table 3 summarizes
the key notations used in this paper.

4.2.1 The number of traces. We used simplified notations
ùëáùëö, ùëáùëé and ùëáùëê to refer to the money transfer traces, account
creation traces and contract invocation traces, respectively.
This metric reflects the popularity of a certain type of activity
along the timeline. For example, a popular gambling DApp
will introduce large number of ùëáùëê (as the player invokes the

contracts of the gambling DApp) and ùëáùëö (as the player sends
and receives money from the gambling DApp). Moreover,
for each kind of trace, we tag the role of invokers, i.e., from
a smart contract or a user account. The trends can reflect
whether the corresponding blockchain is mainly used as a
payment network or a decentralized system with emerging
and powerful applications (i.e., smart contracts).

4.2.2 Distribution of node degree. The indegree and outde-
gree of a node represent how many edges are directed to,
or pointed from that node. The degree of a node is the sum
of its indegree and outdegree. The node degrees distribution
reflects the centralization of the blockchain in terms of certain
activities. To measure this in our later analysis, we plot the
degree/indegree/outdegree distribution for each graph, in
which the y-axis is the proportion of nodes and x-axis is
the size of degree/indegree/outdegree. On the basis of these
plots, we take the logarithm of both axes, and perform a fit
with function ùë¶ ‚àº ùë•ùõº . The the lower the ùõº, the shorter the tail,
and the less centralized the corresponding traces. We illustrate
a concrete example of degree distribution in ¬ß5.3.

4.2.3 Pearson Correlation Coefficient (ùëÖ). On top of the in-
degree and outdegree of different nodes, we further measure
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient [4] (denoted as ùëÖ in the
following) between them. ùëÖ reflects whether the distribution
of outdegree and indegree have a linear relationship. It is
between 1 and ‚àí1 to indicate strong positive or negative cor-
relation. For example, a popular DApp interacts frequently
with users, leading to both high indegree and outdegree for
all participants. To this end, the ùëÖ would be close to 1, in-
dicating strong positive correlation. Thus, ùëÖ indicates the
consistency of indegree and outdegree of nodes within a graph.

4.2.4 Weakly connected component (WCC) & Strongly con-
nected component (SCC). In graph theory, if there exists a
path between ùë£ùëñ to ùë£ ùëó in a directed graph, there exists a set
of edges end-to-end whose starting and ending points are
ùë£ùëñ and ùë£ ùëó , respectively. In WCC, there exists a path between
two arbitrary nodes but without differentiating the starting
point and the end point. In SCC, however, it requires that
there exists a bi-directional path between any two nodes.

5

To this end, if the number of WCCs drops, it means there
exists a node with extensive coverage; and if the number
increases, it means such a node disappears. Furthermore,
the number of SCCs examines the possibility of two-way
interaction of that node. Consequently, the number of WCCs
and SCCs reflects the connectivity between nodes in terms of
one-way and two-way interaction, respectively. For example, a
spammer would initiate a large amount of ùëáùëö or ùëáùëê to deliver
its message, but few accounts would reply. Thus, the number
of WCCs and SCCs would respectively drop and rise due to
many one-way edges emerging.

5 EVOLUTION OF MONEY TRANSFERS
5.1 Graph Construction
To build ùëÄùëáùê∫, we first define the money transfer trace, i.e.,
ùëáùëö in Bitcoin, Ethereum and EOSIO. Specifically, in Ethereum,
a transaction with a certain amount of Ether and a blank
input field is regarded as a ùëáùëö. The payer and payee can
be identified easily by their addresses. In EOSIO, we further
parse the following notifications initiated from eosio.token
after transfer requests. Hence, we can extract the real partici-
pants and construct a ùëáùëö directly between them. For Bitcoin,
a transaction may have multiple inputs and outputs, which
are regarded as two sets: payers and payees. Therefore, we
follow previous work [17] and insert an additional node and
label it by the corresponding transaction id, ùë°ùë•ùëñùëë.

As defined in Table 3, each ùëáùëö can be formally repre-
sented as (ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó, ùë§, ùë°), indicating at time ùë°, ùë£ùëñ transferred
ùë§ tokens to ùë£ ùëó . Then, by converting the timestamp ùë° to
date ùëë (formatted as ùë¶ùë¶ùë¶ùë¶ ‚àí ùëÄùëÄ) and adding ùë§ up as ùë§ ‚àó,
we can group ùëáùëös with the same payer and payee on a
monthly basis for each platform. This can be formalized
as {(ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó, ùë§ ‚àó, ùëë)|ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó ‚àà ùëâ , ùë§ ‚àó ‚àà R+}. Consequently, ùëÄùëáùê∫s
can be defined as a weighted directed graph: ùëÄùëáùê∫ = (ùëâ , ùê∏),
where ùê∏ is the above mentioned set and ùëâ is a set of nodes
represented as: (ùëñùëë, ùëôùëéùëèùëíùëô). Specifically, ùëñùëë is the identifier
to distinguish nodes within a platform; and the ùëôùëéùëèùëíùëô is the
category of DApps to which the ùëñùëë belongs, according to the
off-chain information we collected. Consequently, we have
created 214 MFGs, 135 for Bitcoin, 57 for Ethereum and 22

for EOSIO. We spend the rest of this section inspecting ùëÄùëáùê∫
using the four metrics defined in ¬ß4.

5.2 Number of Traces
5.2.1 Overall evolution. The number of ùëáùëö over time across
three platforms is shown in Fig. 2. The number of ùëáùëö in
Bitcoin has always been greater than Ethereum‚Äôs. Since Oct.
2018, the number of ùëáùëö in EOSIO has surpassed the other
two platforms. Though there was a decline from late 2018,
its number has reached 2.1 billion in ùëÄùëáùê∫ 2019‚àí11
, which is
more than an order of magnitude higher than Bitcoin and
Ethereum at the same time.

ùëíùëúùë†

We further show the proportion of ùëáùëö out of all traces by
a dashed line in Fig. 2. Note that we omit the percentage of
Bitcoin, as it is always 100% (the Bitcoin network is solely
composed of ùëáùëö). For Ethereum, we observe three troughs
in late-2015, Oct. 2016 and Nov. 2017. These were caused by
Dwarfpool [8], a DoS attack [44], and a DApp called Cryp-
toKitties [2], respectively. To be specific, the mining pool
and the DoS attack both invoked a huge number of ùëáùëê (see
¬ß7). The DoS attack took advantage of the flawed design
of the price of gas (see ¬ß2.2.4). CryptoKitties is a collectible
game where players can trade and exchange kitties. However,
kitties are represented by alternative tokens, whose transfer
is regarded as ùëáùëê in our paper. Except for these three troughs,
the overall share of ùëáùëö in Ethereum has been gradually de-
creasing, which we believe is due to the emergence of DeFi
since May 2017. According to our data, in just six months,
the number of DeFi related ùëáùëê had risen by a remarkable
486.3% and another 7,420.4% for the next half year.

In contrast, the amount of ùëáùëö in EOSIO surged in late-
2018, which was due to the popularity of gambling DApps.
This type of DApps requires frequent and abundant money
transferred between players and contracts. Our collected
data indicates there were 237 million ùëáùëö related to gambling
DApps in EOSIO in Nov. 2018 (equivalent to 23.4 times of all
ùëáùëö in Ethereum in the same month). After this, the share of
ùëáùëö also started to go down until Nov. 2019. The emergence

of EIDOS1 [12] forced the percentage of ùëáùëö to around 66%
(i.e. two-thirds) of all traces in each month (see ¬ß8.4.1).

5.2.2 The role of initiators. Fig. 3 shows the percentage
of the role of initiators, from whom the ùëáùëö is initiated, in
Ethereum and EOSIO. An obvious trough existed in Oct. 2016
from Fig. 3a. This is because the DoS attack requires frequent
invocations of ùëáùëö, which can be easily achieved by smart
contracts instead of regular accounts (i.e., human). Except for
that, we observe that users in Ethereum prefer transferring
money on their own, though the ratio was still gradually
going down. According to our data, along with the increase
of the absolute number of ùëáùëö (see Fig. 2), since 2018, the num-
ber of ùëáùëö initiated by EOA has dropped by 67.6%. Moreover,
in EOSIO, we see a surge of ùëáùëö initiated from smart contracts
in late-2018, as the contracts of gambling DApps needed to
invoke ùëáùëö to return money to their winners. Our data illus-
trates that among these 237M pieces of gambling related ùëáùëö,
78.38% of them were initiated by gambling DApps.

Insight: The activity of the blockchain ecosystems has
shown continuous growth in terms of transferring native tokens,
in-part incentivized by killer DApps. The proportion of transfer
transactions reveals that both Ethereum and EOSIO has been
experiencing a decline, due to them departing from pure value-
transfer networks.

1This accepts a user‚Äôs transfer of EOS and returns it back immediately. In the
meanwhile, it initiates another transaction with a certain amount of EIDOS
tokens, issued by themselves but can be traded in exchanges. Therefore, the
ratio of ùëáùëö to ùëáùëê related to EIDOS is around 2 to 1.

5.3 Degree
As explained in ¬ß4.2, we use ùõº to measure the degree distribu-
tion. We first illustrate its meaning using a concrete example.
Fig. 4 illustrates the ùõº of indegree and outdegree distribution
in ùëÄùëáùê∫ 2019‚àí10
. Each dot in Fig. 4 shows that
there is ùë¶ percent of nodes with the degree/indegree/outdegree
valued as ùë• (in the corresponding month and platform).
The distribution of node degree is quite different across the
blockchains. Note, the larger the ùõº, the more obvious the
long-tail distribution, indicating less variabilty in the nodes‚Äô
degree. More importantly, a high ùõº means greater centraliza-
tion. For example, we identify a family of accounts in EOSIO
that invoke spam advertisements in Oct. 2019 (more details
in ¬ß8.4.2). Due to this, Fig. 4a has points in the top left corner.
These are nodes with a small indegree, representing victims
of this spam attack. In contrast, we see a set of points located
in the bottom right corner of Fig. 4b, i.e., the spammers.

5.3.1 Overall evolution. To study this centralization, we fur-
ther calculate the ùõº of the degree/indegree/outdegree dis-
tribution for each platform on a monthly basis. The trend
of the ùõºs are shown in Fig. 5. The general trend shows that,
in Bitcoin, except for the infant stage (prior to 2012), the
ùõº of indegree and outdegree distributions were quite sta-
ble and changed almost simultaneously. Moreover, the ùõº of
Ethereum‚Äôs indegree distribution shows an overall gradual
upward trend, while that of outdegree was gradually stabiliz-
ing. This signals growing centralization of indegree distribu-
tion. In EOSIO, the ùõº metrics fluctuate significantly though.

Compared to Ethereum, the indegree was less centralized
but the outdegree was exactly in the opposite position.

of blockchain platforms over time in terms of ùëÄùëáùê∫.

5.3.2 Per-chain analysis. When we look in detail on the per-
chain basis, subtle differences arise. As we see from Fig. 5a,
prior to 2012, Bitcoin was still in its infancy and the number
of ùëáùëö per month was so small that a few transactions could
cause a large shift in the ùõº. From Fig. 5b, we see that prior
to mid-2018, the ùõº of outdegree distribution went higher
than that of the indegree distribution. Combining with the
historical prices of Ether [28], we see that the price was go-
ing up and reached a local maximum from mid-2017. This
would motivate frequent buy and sell transactions through
exchanges, who typically have multiple entries used to col-
lect deposit requests from users. Hence, this has resulted
in more centralized indegree distribution than outdegree.
According to our data, the exchange related ùëáùëö during late
2017 accounted for 15.7% ‚Äî 48.18% of the total DApp-related
ùëáùëö. For EOSIO, except for Oct. 2019, we see the trend of ùõº
was similar with the Ethereum‚Äôs (see Fig. 5c,). Also, if we
combine the historical price of EOS [27], we see that there
were some price peaks, especially before Dec. 2018 and Jun.
2019. However, the existence of exchanges in EOSIO can-
not drive the ùõº so dramatically. Other driving forces include
the growth of gambling DApps in Sep. 2018, i.e., around 6.9
million transactions were initiated from gambling DApps.
The top 1% accounted for 98.1% of them, which explains the
greater centralization of outdegree.

Insight: Compared to the relative stable degree distribution
in Bitcoin, the degree distribution in Ethereum and EOSIO
has been significantly affected by the price of tokens. This
has resulted in greater centralization (with some dominant
accounts) that are reflected in the fluctuation of ùõº.

Figure 6: Pearson‚Äôs correlation between indegree and
outdegree of blockchain platforms over time.

The correlation (ùëÖ) between indegree and outdegree of
nodes for these platforms are depicted in Fig. 6. After the
infant stage of Bitcoin, its ùëÖ was relatively high, reflecting a
strong positive correlation of indegree and outdegree. How-
ever, this may be due to the topology of ùëÄùëáùê∫ùëèùë°ùëê , i.e., the
node must have one indegree (the referring output is directed
from its ùë°ùë•ùëñùëë) and zero/one outdegree (depending on if it is
(un)spent). In Ethereum, after the DoS attack, there were two
peaks that indicate a strong correlation: Mar. 2017 (0.521) and
Dec. 2017 (0.607). These are caused by ShapeShift [15] and
Cryptokitties, respectively. The former is an exchange which
allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies. Though Cryp-
tokitties led to frequent token exchanges, it still required a
huge amount of Ether transfer to perform game logic, like
trading and breeding kitties. In terms of ùëáùëö, the core contract
of Cryptokitties accounted for 469K and 458K outdegree and
indegree, respectively. However, this has been gradually de-
creasing since 2018, due to the emergence of DeFi, which is
more likely to initiate ùëáùëê instead of ùëáùëö (see ¬ß7).

As for EOSIO, the overall tendency of ùëÖ shows there was
nearly no correlation between indegree and outdegree, ex-
cept for two months: Apr. 2019 and Nov. 2019. One previous
work [42] analyzed the EOS Global event that happened in
Apr. 2019. This was a bot-like account that sent and received
a huge number of EOS to fake an exaggerated trading volume.
This resulted in huge outdegree and indegree. The peak in
Nov. 2019 resulted from EIDOS, a spam airdrop event, whose
contract received a lot of EOS from investors and returned
them back immediately (detailed in ¬ß8.4.1).

Insight: Bitcoin has a relatively high ùëÖ, but Ethereum‚Äôs
ùëÖ has been gradually decreasing. This may be related to the
emergence of popoular DeFi DApps. In contrast, EOSIO has
maintained a relatively low level of ùëÖ in transferring money,
except for the peaks imported by exchanges and spams.

5.5 Connected Components
Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the numbers of WCC and SCC.
Generally, these numbers reflect the (dis)apperance of nodes
who could import huge amounts of (bi-)directional edges (see

8

Figure 7: The number of WCC and SCC in different
blockchain platforms over time.

¬ß4.2.4). Note that, due to the impossibility of constructing bi-
directional edges in ùëÄùëáùê∫ùëèùë°ùëê for the Bitcoin network, we only
measure its number of WCC. Until Apr. 2018, the number
of WCCs for Ethereum and Bitcoin have been almost equal
(48,529 for Ethereum and 55,387 for Bitcoin). In contrast, the
number of WCC for EOSIO was only 230 at most (in Apr.
2019). There are two possible reasons: 1) a relatively lower
number of accounts and smart contracts in EOSIO compared
to Ethereum and Bitcoin (see Table 2); and 2)ùëáùëö is more likely
to be invoked in EOSIO (see Fig. 2). In Oct. 2019, the number
of WCC in EOSIO dropped to 3. This was caused by an
enormous amount of spam advertisements (detailed in ¬ß8.4.2)
that carry tiny EOS but cover many accounts. Astonishingly,
this pushes the size of WCC as 579,964, covering more than
99.9% of nodes in ùëÄùëáùê∫ 2019‚àí10
.
As to SCC, the difference between EOSIO and Ethereum
has reduced, which suggests that one-way directed edges
in ùëáùëö still dominate. In EOSIO, we also see a sudden drop
in Nov. 2019 (the number of SCC is 55,452), as the EIDOS
enforces the bi-directional ùëáùëö.

ùëíùëúùë†

Insight: The number of WCC was relatively low in EOSIO
compared to other two platforms, suggesting that accounts in
EOSIO have stronger connections than those in Bitcoin and
Ethereum. That said, violent fluctuations were introduced by
certain misbehaviors. Moreover, the numbers of WCCs and
SCCs have an upward trend, meaning that the platforms are
constantly flooded with new users. However, our results show
that the existing contracts do not perform many money trans-
fers with them.

6 EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNT CREATION
6.1 Graph Construction
Though we uniformly defined accounts in all three platforms
(see ¬ß3.2), the concept of an ‚Äòaccounts‚Äô in Bitcoin is still vague.
Therefore, we only discuss ùëáùëé, account creation transactions,
in Ethereum and EOSIO. In Ethereum, we focus on the smart
contract, which can be created by an internal transaction
whose type is create (see ¬ß2.2.3). As for EOSIO, we parse the
notifications followed by function newaccount in theofficial
account eosio to parse the actual creator and the created
account (explained in ¬ß2.2.3).

Similar to the definition of ùëáùëö (see ¬ß5.1 and Table 3), ùëáùëé
is also defined as (ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó, ùë§, ùë°). However, as each ùë£ ùëó can only
be created once, the ùë§ is always 1 here. Therefore, we can
group ùëáùëés by only converting ùë° as ùëë: {(ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó, ùëë)|ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó ‚àà ùëâ }.
Eventually, we obtain an unweighted directed graph ùê¥ùê∂ùê∫ for
each month: ùê¥ùê∂ùê∫ = (ùëâ , ùê∏), where ùê∏ is the above set and ùëâ
is the set composed of nodes as introduced in ¬ß5.1. In total,
we have created 79 ACGs: 57 for Ethereum and 22 for EOSIO.
We spend the rest of this section inspecting ùê¥ùê∂ùê∫ using three
of the metrics defined in ¬ß4.

(a) Ethereum

(b) EOSIO

Figure 9: The distribution of initiators of ùëáùëé.

6.2 Number of Traces
The number of ùëáùëé and its corresponding proportion to the
number of all traces in the corresponding month are shown
in Fig. 8. Taking the number of ùëáùëé in Ethereum as a whole,
we can observe a conspicuous upwards trend. Contrary to
Ethereum, the number of newly created accounts in EOSIO
has remained at a relatively low but stable level. The ex-
ception is during Apr. 2019, where the EOS Global contract
created more than 241K bot-accounts. Moreover, in EOSIO,
except for the first month, the ratio of ùëáùëé was almost negligi-
ble (0.17% in Aug. 2018 was the maximum ratio). Contrary,
there was always a certain percentage of ùëáùëé in Ethereum for
each month (around 1% ‚Äì 2.5%), though the percentage was

much lower than ùëáùëö‚Äôs (see Fig. 2). The main reason is that
creating an account in Ethereum is almost free compared
to EOSIO2, which may make users more reluctant to reuse
existing accounts for different purposes.

Fig. 9 further shows the role of the initiator who invokes
ùëáùëés. Especially in Mar. 2020, the ratio of Ethereum accounts
created by smart contracts is 33.7 times higher than that of
EOAs. Such an astonishing ratio shows a dramatic contrast to
the ratio in ùëÄùëáùê∫ (see Fig. 3a). After manual investigation, we
find that this is due to a contract named GasToken [9], which
helps users to spend less gas to complete the transaction ‚Äî
this created a huge amount of accounts since 2019. The ùëáùëé it
initiated accounted for 62% of all ùëáùëé in Mar. 2020. Moreover,
we find that the ratio of ùëáùëé initiated from contracts has little
correlation with the prosperity of DApps. Overall, the DApp
related account creation transactions has never accounted
for higher than 15% in each month.

Insight: In Ethereum and EOSIO, the absolute number and
ratio of account creation transactions are relative low compared
to transfer transactions. Creating accounts is less necessary
in Ethereum, and EOSIO charges expensive fees. Moreover,
accounts are more likely to be created by contracts, indicating
the tendency for more relationships between smart contract.

6.3 Degree
As each node can only be created once, this leads to a con-
stant indegree value for each node. Hence, we only measure
the distribution of outdegree and degree, and the evolution
of the corresponding metrics ùõº, as shown in Fig. 10.

For Ethereum, prior to mid-2017, the values of ùõº show
volatility, which we believe is caused by the relatively small
number of ùëáùëé during this period (see Fig. 8). From then on,
both platforms exhibit an upwards trend for the ùõº of the out-
degree distribution, especially in EOSIO. In other words, the
account creation behavior has become increasingly central-
ized. For example, account genialwombat which belongs to
Wombat Wallet [16], offers a free account creation service for
its users. This wallet has created more than 32.2K accounts.
Furthermore, the top 1% of accounts in EOSIO have created
97.3% of all accounts in Mar. 2020. Interestingly, we can ob-
serve two sudden decreases in both sub-graphs: Aug. 2018 in
Ethereum and Apr. 2019 in EOSIO. Combining the off-chain
information we collected, we conclude that these two outliers
were caused by an attack against a Fomo3D-like game called
Last Winner [18] and the EOS Global event, respectively. The
former took advantage of lots of newly created accounts to
attack the DApp. This account creation process followed a
multi-level structure [18] leading to invoking enormous ùëáùëé.

2Creating an EOSIO account will cost 5.39 USD [43], while it takes less than
0.01 USD in Ethereum on that day.

Insight: Except for the early stage of Ethereum, the ùõº of
the outdegree distributions show an upward trend for both
platforms. The exceptions are two troughs, which resulted from
attacks against Last Winner and EOS Global, respectively. Es-
pecially in EOSIO, the upwards ùõº indicates the emergence of
large account creation providers which made the invocations
of account creation transactions more centralized.

6.4 Connected Components
Fig. 11 shows the number of WCCs in Ethereum and EOSIO.
Ethereum shows an upward trend followed by a decline in
terms of the number of WCC. In EOSIO, it was also gradu-
ally decreasing (due to the emergence of account creation
services). Moreover, we observe an obvious trough during
Oct. 2016 in Ethereum, which had 294 WCCs. We believe this
is related to the DoS attack, which created a large number
of accounts and prevented others from creating accounts
properly. Besides, the strange 1 WCC in EOSIO in Jun. 2018
was because the account creation tree composed of invoked
ùëáùëé has a common root node: official account eosio.

Insight: The account creation process has become more
centralized, causing the number of WCC to go down contin-
uously. This further reflects the tighter relationship between
smart contracts in terms of account creation behavior.

eosio.token and the account creation action to eosio. All
the other actions are treated as ùëáùëê . Consequently, we collect
all the ùëáùëê as (ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó, ùë§, ùë°). Identical to the process introduced
in ¬ß5.1, the ùê∂ùêºùê∫ is defined as a weighted directed graph: ùê∂ùêºùê∫ =
(ùëâ , ùê∏), where ùê∏ = {(ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó, ùë§ ‚àó, ùëë)|ùë£ùëñ, ùë£ ùëó ‚àà ùëâ , ùë§ ‚àó ‚àà R+} and ùëâ
is the set of nodes. In total, we have created 79 CIGs, 57 for
Ethereum and 22 for EOSIO.

7.2 Number of Traces
Fig. 12 depicts the number of ùëáùëê and its corresponding ra-
tio across time. All these four lines fluctuate wildly. For
Ethereum, except for the spike in Oct. 2016 caused by the DoS
attack which led to the number of ùëáùëê exceeding 189 million,
its absolute number shows a gradual upward trend. More-
over, the growth of the ratio is dramatic: from the launch of
Ethereum to Mar. 2020, the ratio grew from 9.60% to 84.69%,
thereby starting to dominate Ethereum‚Äôs network.

As for EOSIO, its absolute number was also rising and was
about an order of magnitude more than that of Ethereum,
reaching almost two orders of magnitude after Nov. 2019.
However, the trends between its ratio and absolute numbers
are inconsistent. To be specific, we can see an obvious spike
on Jul. 2018 that resulted from two accounts: blocktwitter
and chaintwitter, which imported more than 64.9M and
21.0M ùëáùëê . Then, during late-2018, a gambling DApp led to
frequent invocations between accounts, thereby resulting
in a trough during this period. Since then, the ratio was
continuously rising till Nov. 2019, since when the EIDOS‚Äôs
mechanism almost fixes the ratio to 33.3%.

The role of invokers who initiated ùëáùëê is also interesting,
as shown in Fig. 13. The DoS attack in Ethereum (Oct. 2016)
is mainly initiated by smart contracts. Since then, smart
contracts increasingly invoke other smart contracts. But in
EOSIO, a different tendency is observed: users in EOSIO pre-
ferred to invoke smart contracts from their own accounts. In
May 2019, 41.42% of ùëáùëê was initiated by regular accounts. The
reason is unclear, however, from Nov. 2019, EIDOS started
to dominate the ecosystem, resulting in the percentage of
smart-contract-invoking invocations rising to 98.27%.

Insight: The number of smart contract invocations has been
increasing across both platforms, confirming their growing
use. However, the number and the corresponding ratio were
inconsistent in EOSIO, as they were significantly affected by
gambling DApps and EIDOS.

7.3 Degree
Fig. 14 illustrates the degree distribution. Interestingly, the ùõº
of outdegree distribution of EOSIO is overall higher than that
of Ethereum. The ùõº of the indegree distribution, however,
is on the opposite position. It indicates that, most accounts
in Ethereum invoke fewer contracts than accounts in EOSIO,
but there exist some super nodes that accept most of the ùëáùëê in
Ethereum. Moreover, in EOSIO, the ùõº of the outdegree distri-
bution is almost higher than the indegree‚Äôs all the time. This
illustrates the existence of some killer DApps that invokes
many ùëáùëê . The significant upward trend in 2020 in Fig. 14b
reflects that the initiation of ùëáùëê became more centralized.
Recall the mechanism of EIDOS we briefly introduced in
¬ß5.2, which initiates lots of EIDOS token transfers to ben-
efit users. Alone, it accounted for 92.2% of ùëáùëê in Nov. 2019,
which indicates the tendency towards centralization in EO-
SIO. Additionally, in Ethereum, for the ùõº of the outdegree
distribution, the trough during the whole 2018 in Fig. 14a is
highly conspicuous. The reason is the emergence of some
popular DeFi DApps who attract users to invoke them; this
finally makes the distribution of outdegree less centralized.

11

Insight: The ùõº of the outdegree/indegree distributions in
EOSIO and Ethereum follow opposite trends. This reflects the
centralization of the outdegree in EOSIO, caused by popular
gambling DApps and mis-behaviors; and the centralization of
the indegree in Ethereum due to the emergence of DeFi DApps.

7.4 Pearson Coefficient (ùëÖ)
Fig. 15 gives the ùëÖ between indegree and outdegree in terms
of contract invocation. We see there was little correlation be-
tween the indegree and outdegree in the ùê∂ùêºùê∫ùëíùë°‚Ñé and ùê∂ùêºùê∫ùëíùëúùë† ,
and there never existed a negative correlation. That said, in
some months, the value of ùëÖ rises sharply. This is caused by
popular DApps or malicious behaviors; these have such a
large indegree and outdegree that they are able to affect the
entire network. For example, in Aug. 2018, a gambling game
called Last Winner launched in Ethereum; and in Aug. 2019, a
popular DApp pornhashbaby appeared in EOSIO. The former
resulted in 876K indegree and 311K outdegree, accounting
for more than 45% gambling related ùëáùëê in ùê∂ùêºùê∫ 2018‚àí08

.

ùëíùë°‚Ñé

Insight: The indegree and outdegree of nodes in both plat-
forms had little correlation in terms of contract invocation.
However, this metric can be severely impacted by misbehaviors
or popular DApps.

7.5 Connected Components
Fig. 16 shows the number of WCCs and SCCs in Ethereum
and EOSIO in ùê∂ùêºùê∫s. These have been gradually increasing.
The peak on Jan. 2018 in Ethereum‚Äôs WCC is obvious, caused
by the sudden decrease of users in Bittrex due to a hack
event [51]. Moreover, the number of WCCs in EOSIO is
nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than Ethereum‚Äôs.
Combining Fig. 12 and Fig. 14b, we conclude that users on
EOSIO were calling contracts more frequently.

Besides, some accounts initiated a large number of ùëáùëê ,
which covered numerous contracts and kept the number
of WCC at a low level. The maximum WCC has covered at
least 99.24% of nodes in the corresponding months. However,
for SCC, we can conclude that the callback from the smart
contract is unusual. This may be due to two reasons: 1) the
initiating account is a regular account, thus it is unable to
callback by a ùëáùëê ; and 2) the callback trace just sends some

with the highest degree (named the supernode) in the cor-
responding graph will be identified; (2) for ùõº of the degree
distribution, there are two cases: trough or peak, correspond-
ing to dispersion and centralization, respectively. Therefore,
for the former, the strategy tries to identify the node(s) who
import many nodes with a small degree; for the latter, the
supernode with the highest degree/indegree/outdegree will
be labeled; (3) based on our extensive manual investigation,
a node with high indegree and outdegree simultaneously is
likely to push the ùëÖ higher. Therefore, the strategy focuses
on the node with the highest product of indegree and outde-
gree; (4) the significant change in the number of connected
components is always related to the (dis)appearance of nodes
that are directly connected to lots of nodes in the network.
To this end, the nodes with the most one-way or two-way
edges with the others will be identified.

After the node(s) are identified according to the above
strategy, it and its connected edges in the corresponding
graph will be removed. We then recalculate the correspond-
ing metric to see if the absolute value of z-score drops lower
than a threshold. If not, the above process is repeated until
the outlier disappears. To guarantee accuracy, we manually
recheck all removed nodes to confirm they are the actual
responsible ones. In other words, for each outlier, our method
can extract a set of responsible nodes that are related to at-
tack/spam events or killer DApps.

We classify the outliers into two major groups: Killer
DApps and Misbehaviors, as shown in Table 4. The Killer
DApp category indicates the outlier is due to the activity
of a popular DApp. The misbehavior category is divided
into three sub-categories: Attack, Resource Manipulation, and
Spam. An attack means the outlier has been caused by a
well-known attack, like the DAO reentrancy attack [26]. Re-
source manipulation indicates the outlier is caused by an
exploitation on the resource model, like EIDOS (see ¬ß2.2.4).
The spam sub-category covers spam advertisements and bot
accounts. Note that the z-score algorithm also flags some
outliers in the infant stage of the blockchains. We omit these,
as a few transactions can lead to a volatile swing on the value
of a metric.

and EOSIO over time in terms of ùê∂ùêºùê∫

native tokens, which is classified as a ùëáùëö. Note that there is a
missing point of #SCC in Nov. 2016. This is because Ethereum
officially deployed a sweeper contract3 that initiated more
than 16 million one-way ùëáùëê to remove all the redundant and
meaningless contracts created by the DoS attack in October.
This resulted in a large number of SCCs (>16M).

Insight: The growing number of accounts, indicate smart

contracts are gaining increasing popularity.

8 CHARACTERIZING OUTLIERS
8.1 Definition of Outlier
Our previous exploration suggests that some events (e.g.,
DoS attacks) and influential accounts have a large impact
on ecosystems. In this section, we explore such events and
addresses. Note our outlier analysis is not intended to iden-
tify attacks, as many attack events may not cause noticeable
changes to the overall ecosystems. Instead, our purpose is to
pinpoint what kinds of events/DApps can facilitate or im-
pede the development of the blockchain ecosystems. For all
metrics considered, some data points deviate significantly
from the average [59]. We refer to these points as outliers.

8.2 Detecting and Labelling Outliers
8.2.1 Detecting Outliers. We use a simple but efficient algo-
rithm, z-score [7], to flag outliers in each time series. Z-scores
quantify the unusualness of an observation. Z-scores are the
number of standard deviations above and below the mean
that each value falls. Specifically, if the value of a metric for
ùë•‚àíùúá
a month is ùë•, the z-score would be: ùëß =
ùúé , where ùúá is the
average of ùë• and corresponding values before and after three
months (7 values in total), and ùúé is the standard deviation
for these 7 values. Therefore, the absolute value of the z-
score represents the distance between the ùë• and its adjacent
elements mean in units standard deviation.

Labelling Outlier. We propose a semi-automated method

8.2.2
to label outliers. Our idea is that outliers result from suddenly
popular DApps or misbehaviors. Thus, removing the respon-
sible node(s) can make the absolute value of z-score smaller
than a threshold. For each metric, we have different strategies
to identify the responsible node(s).

8.3 Results
Table 4 shows the overall results (see Table 5 to Table 7 in
Appendix for details), 87 outliers are identified in total: 13
for Bitcoin, 49 for Ethereum, and 25 for EOSIO. As concluded
before, Bitcoin is the most stable platform. Though EOSIO
fluctuates in several plots, due to its relative short history,
its number of outliers is below Ethereum‚Äôs.

Among the 87 outliers, 45% (39) belongs to the misbehavior
category. Moreover, most of them are in the resource ma-
nipulation and spam sub-categories. Ethereum suffers more
from malicious exploitation on resources. The main reason
is the DoS attack, which was so powerful that it significantly
altered many metrics in Oct. 2016. Due to the resource model
in EOSIO (see ¬ß2.2.4), it is more likely to suffer from spam.
This is partly due to the EOS Global event, which created
many useless accounts and transferred EOS between them.
The spam advertisements in EOSIO also played an important
role (detailed in ¬ß8.4.2). Moreover, we observe that, compared
to EOSIO, Ethereum is impacted more by killer DApps. These
apps are evenly distributed across categories. This likely in-
dicates that Ethereum is still preferred by DApp developers.
The only killer app in EOSIO is the pornhashbaby, which
brought significant traffic until it was shutdown.

8.4 Case Studies
We next briefly introduce two case studies, while the details
can be found in Appendix ¬ßC.

8.4.1 EIDOS Event. From Fig. 1 we observe that, in Nov.
2019, the number of traces in EOSIO jumped by 1,009.82%
compared to the preceding month (reaching 3.21 billion
pieces). Surprisingly, over 99% of the transactions are re-
lated to the EIDOS contract. However, only a few hundred
accounts interacted with the contract. This suggests that
billions of transactions were introduced by a small number
of addresses. We further calculate the total volume of money
transferred to the EIDOS contract, and the average EOS per
ùëáùëö. After a slightly increase in Dec. 2019, both of these two
metrics dropped significantly. In Mar. 2020, only 1.43 million
EOS were transferred to EIDOS (around 6.53% of the peak).
Meanwhile, the average EOS per ùëáùëö decreased to 6 √ó 10‚àí4,
while 1 √ó 10‚àí4 is the minimum allowed transfer amount in
EOSIO. We conclude that players were becoming rational and
centralized, and a number of services have emerged [14, 55]
that allow participants to maximize benefits at minimal cost.
EIDOS also overtook other DApps, e.g., previously popular
gambling DApps, and has had a significant negative impact
on the entire ecosystem.

13

Spam Advertisement. During the analysis of Fig. 5c,
8.4.2
we have observed two strange spikes in the ùõº of the out-
degree distribution (Mar. and Oct. 2019). We discover that
these two outliers are due to spam advertisement. Spammers
have taken advantage of the resource model in EOSIO, which
allows users to initialize spam advertisements to cover huge
amounts of accounts; specifically, in the memo field [13] of
transactions, users can write use this to free-text. We see
that spammer write things like bait-and-switch advertise-
ments. Using ùëÄùëáùê∫ and ùê∂ùêºùê∫, we further propose an auto-
mated method to identify spammers (see Appendix ¬ßC.2
for details). The key idea is that within a given time frame,
the spammer would initiate spam advertisements carrying
identical spam content by the lowest cost to cover as many
accounts as possible. Thus, we can group together small
transactions with identical content to flag spam candidates.
Through this, we identify 206 distinct spam accounts in EO-
SIO, and we identify two account family: peostoken and
defind.io, who are responsible for the spikes located in
Mar. 2019 and Oct. 2019.

9 DISCUSSION
9.1 Cross-chain Comparison
Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a value-transfer network, and does not
support features like smart contracts. Moreover, its simple
but effective transaction fee mechanism guarantees that it is
hard to be abused. To this end, Bitcoin has been in a steady
growth and has been hard to be manipulate according to its
number of transfer transactions and degree distribution.
Ethereum. Ethereum is still evolving, especially in terms of
contract invocation. Prior to 2018, the most dominant trans-
action in Ethereum is the Ether transfer. The price of Ether
would always incentivize a more frequent and centralized
Ether transfer between users and exchanges. Since then, the
emergence of DeFi has increased the number of interactions
between smart contracts. Along with the growing number
of transactions, the relatively stable ratio of newly created
smart contracts also implies the liveness in Ethereum.
EOSIO. Via DPoS, EOSIO is able to carry out hundreds of
times the traces than Bitcoin and Ethereum (who adopt PoW).
Prior to Nov. 2019, though there was a slight decline in the

number of transfers and contract invocations, the popular-
ity of gambling DApps has attracted many users. However,
the appearance of EIDOS almost collapsed the entire net-
work: The TPS was pushed to its limit, and all other normal
transactions suffered high congestion.

9.2 Threats to Validity and Future Work
This study carries several limitations. First, we primarily
study the evolution of the ecosystems based on graph analy-
sis and, by definition, the metrics used are limited. Although
we have considered the most widely used metrics, more met-
rics (e.g., global clustering coefficient [3], page rank [10],
reciprocity [5]) could be adopted to gain further understand-
ing of ecosystems. Second, in several cases, we have relied
on heuristics and manual validation due to the paucity of
ground-truth data. For example, during the outlier analy-
sis, we have manually confirmed the underlying reasons for
several cases. We agree that automated approaches (e.g., via
machine learning) could be used to facilitate the process.
Third, our study relies solely on transaction analysis. We be-
lieve additional code analysis (of the smart contracts) could
help us to gain a better understanding of ecosystems. Finally,
although some highly influential attacks and unreported
scams (e.g., the scam advertisements in EOSIO) have been
discovered by us, we do not consider a number of known
attacks in the community (as they did not have a noticeable
impact on the overall ecosystem). For future work, we plan
to address the above limitations.

10 RELATED WORK
Blockchain Transaction Analysis. Some previous works
have focused on blockchain transaction analysis for a single
blockchain platform, e.g., Bitcoin [19, 41, 49, 53], Ethereum [24,
25, 46, 47, 60, 62], EOSIO [42, 52] and Monero [48]. Ober et
al. [49] and Awan et al. [19] both analyzed the topology and
dynamics of the Bitcoin transaction graph. Chen et al. [24]
used graph analysis to explore the characteristics of trans-
actions in Ethereum. Similarly, Chen et al. [25] and Huang
et al. [42] also adopted graph analysis, but they focused on
the behaviors of ERC20 tokens and fraudulent activities in
EOSIO, respectively.
Smart Contract & DApp Analysis. There are some works
[58, 61] dedicated to exploring the ecosystem of DApps. For
example, Wu et al. [61] defined the popularity of DApps
by some metrics across different categories. They measured
the reuse of DApps, and the transformation of a traditional
application to a DApp. Wang et al. [58] classify DApps and
users behaviors according to the patterns extracted from
transactions. Moreover, some works [23, 39, 40, 45, 56] have
focused on the security issue of DApps across platforms. For
example, Chen et al. [23] conducted a detailed survey about

14

vulnerabilities and defenses related to smart contracts in
DApps. Su et al. [56] and He et al. [39] measured the attack
instances and clone behaviors against DApps, respectively.

11 CONCLUSION
This paper has presented a longitudinal comparative study
of three representative blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum and
EOSIO. We utilized billions of transaction records to offer
a unique insight into the overall ecosystems. These have
revealed complementary trends amongst the three platforms,
highlighting their differing evolutions. Although our findings
have revealed some promising trends for these technologies,
a number of ‚Äúoutliers‚Äù have also been identified and analyzed,
e.g., abuse by spammers. We believe that our research efforts
contribute positively to inform best operational practices and
will benefit the wider research community and regulators.

The detected outliers and their corresponding sub-category
(category is omitted, details in Table 4), as well as the reason,
are shown in Table 5 to Table 7.

C EIDOS & SPAM ADVERTISEMENTS
In ¬ß8.4, we have briefly introduced the conclusion after we
studied the EIDOS project and spam advertisements behavior
in EOSIO. Here, we will provide the full details for them.

C.1 EIDOS Event
As we briefly explained in ¬ß2.1, EIDOS attracts users to trans-
fer EOS to it inexhaustibly. The mechanism of EIDOS is
illustrated in Fig. 19.

We can see from Fig. 19, once the user transfers arbitrary
amount of EOS by ùëáùëö to its main contract: eidosonecoin
(see steps 1 to 3), the EOS would be immediately returned by
another ùëáùëö (see steps 4 to 6). Then, EIDOS would initiate a ùëáùëê
that invokes the transfer function in its owned smart con-
tract (see steps 9 and 10). In the transfer function, EIDOS
would increase the user‚Äôs balance of EIDOS token whose
value is not related to the amount of EOS in the previous
ùëáùëö. Users can spend these EIDOS tokens in exchanges or
other contracts that accept EIDOS token. Note that the EI-
DOS token is issued by the issue function and part of them
will be transferred to its official team: eidosoneteam (see
steps 7 and 8). Therefore, there also exists an another two ùëáùëê s
which invoke issue and transfer. However, the issuance
of EIDOS is not executed each time, thus the ratio of ùëáùëö to
ùëáùëê is roughly two to one, which were illustrated by the ‚Äòtrace
ratio‚Äô in Fig. 2 and Fig. 12.

According to our statistics, in November 2019, the number
of traces in EOSIO has jumped by 1009.82% over the preced-
ing month, reaching up to 3.21 billion pieces. Therefore, we
further extract all the traces related to EIDOS, and calculate
several related metrics as shown in Fig. 20.

We see that the number of users decreased dramatically
in Mar. 2020: the number has dropped to 643 (around 95.13%
compared to Nov. 2019). In the meanwhile, the number of
related ùëáùëö has increased by 150.43%. These two opposite
changes indicate that the players of EIDOS tend to be spe-
cialized. In other words, some accounts started to a provide
service, which allows users to invest their owned resources
and get dividends back. Actually, there indeed existed some
service providers [14, 55]. These can also be observed from
the ùõº of outdegree distribution during the corresponding
time period (see Fig. 5c).

Moreover, these players were becoming rational. As we
have explained in ¬ß8.4.1, the amount of the returned EIDOS
token has nothing to do with the amount of invested EOS.
Thus, as we can see from Fig. 20c and Fig. 20d, after an
ephemeral increase in the volume of invested EOS and the
amount of EOS per invested traces, the two curves start to go
down sharply. In Mar. 2020, the average EOS per trace was
as low as 6 √ó 10‚àí4, while 1 √ó 10‚àí4 is the minimum allowed
transferred amount in EOSIO and the most rational choice.

following rules:

(1) The average amount of transferred EOS to each user

initiated from ùëÅ is no more than ùë•;

(2) ùëÅ invokes up to ùë¶ pieces of ùëáùëö to each user within a

(b) Amount of ùëáùëö.

(c) Transferred volume in

(d) Average transferred EOS

Figure 20: The statistics of EIDOS project.

Actually, according to our data, in Nov. 2019, 99.80% of ùëáùëö
were valued below 1 EOS. But in Oct. 2019, this percentage
was up to 74.81%. Therefore, we conclude that EIDOS has
captured the whole EOSIO ecosystem via meaningless ùëáùëö
and ùëáùëê transactions, thereby slowing the TPS of other users.

C.2 Spam Advertisement
During the analysis of Fig. 5c, we have observed two strange
spikes, located in Mar. 2019 and Oct. 2019, in the ùõº of outde-
gree distribution. After the analysis of our method mentioned
in ¬ß8.2 and manual verification, we figured out these two
outliers resulted from spam advertisements.

To be specific, taking the advantage of memo field in EO-
SIO transactions [13] where the initiator can freely write
anything, an account or a smart contract is able to initiate
lots of ùëáùëö carrying with 1 √ó 10‚àí4 EOS and bait-and-switch
advertisement to cover as many users as possible.

Based on our investigation, we proposed a detection method-

ology. Specifically, our methodology traverses the ùëÄùëáùê∫ and

18

single month;

(3) More than ùëß users who received ùëáùëö from ùëÅ did not in

turn initiates ùëáùëö or ùëáùëê to ùëÅ ;

(4) The memo should carry the leading content, typically

is an exaggerated statement and a URL.

The ùë•, ùë¶ and ùëß are heuristically set as 0.001, 30, and 500,
which are relative conservative and may lead to false posi-
tives. Thus we further conduct a manual verification focusing
on the memo content and the patterns of behavior. We dis-
cover 206 distinct accounts in total that have initiated spam
advertisements at least for one month. The distribution of
the first appearance time for these 206 accounts is shown
in Fig. 21. We can see the obvious two spikes correspond to
the outliers located in Mar. 2019 and Oct. 2019, respectively.
However, except for these two spikes and the peak in the
late-2018 (caused by gambling DApps), the advertisement
accounts are not so active, especially after EIDOS.

After investigation, we figure out these two spikes are
caused by two clusters of advertisement accounts: peostoken
family and defind.io family. Therefore, we have built a fam-
ily tree to explore the creation relationship, taking advantage
of our ùê¥ùê∂ùê∫, which is shown in Fig. 22. We observe that there
are clusterings (framed by red boxes in the figure) in which
the proportion of advertisements nodes are relatively high.
We have marked the peostoken family and defind.io fam-
ily in Fig. 22, which were the reasons behind the two outliers.
These two clusters are composed of accounts with multi-level
creation relationships.

In addition, we have observed some interesting character-

istics for spam advertisement accounts:

‚Ä¢ The language in memo content is mainly in English
and Chinese, as well as a small percentage of Korean
and Japanese.

‚Ä¢ It is possible for the same account to send out memos
with different content under different time periods,
and even change the language used in the memo.

‚Ä¢ Most of the advertisements are promoting their own
gambling games, and some are promoting their own
tokens or services (e.g., airdrop services). Moreover,
advertisements promoting DeFi-related DApps have
been appearing since Sep. 2019.

‚Ä¢ eostribalert and eostribealrt are a pair of ac-
counts that launch advertisements. The memo in the
latter one contains a URL and convinces users to apply
for TLOS token. Immediately after the former one also
starts sending out a large number of ùëáùëö containing a
memo stating that the URL is fraudulent information.
However, the difference of number of ùëáùëö they sent is
very large, 5.3K and 101K times, respectively.

We conclude that spam advertisement behavior was pop-
ular in EOSIO. They mainly target users who speak English
and Chinese. Moreover, those advertisement accounts usu-
ally have relationships in terms of account creation behavior.

lated accounts, where the red nodes are advertisement
nodes.
