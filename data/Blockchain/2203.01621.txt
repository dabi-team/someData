Abstract—This paper investigates an endogenous security ar-
chitecture for computation ofﬂoading in the Internet of Things
(IoT), where the blockchain technology enables the traceability
of malicious behaviors, and the task data uploading link from
sensors to small base station (SBS) is protected by intelligent
reﬂecting surface (IRS)-assisted physical layer security (PLS).

resources to help sensors perform the task. The existing compu-
tation ofﬂoading schemes usually focus on network performance
improvement, such as energy consumption minimization, and
neglect the Gas fee paid by sensors, resulting in the discontent
of high Gas payers. Here, we design a Gas-oriented computation
ofﬂoading scheme that guarantees the degree of satisfaction of
sensors, while aiming to reduce energy consumption. Also, we
deduce the ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-assisted PLS transmission
that can represent the global secrecy performance to allocate
computational resources. The simulations show that the proposed
scheme ensures that the node paying higher Gas gets stronger
computational resources, and just raises 4% energy consumption
in comparison with energy consumption minimization schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION

With the rapid popularization of the Internet of Things
(IoT) technologies in industrial manufacture, business, etc.,
the endogenous security issues of heterogeneous devices and
infrastructures have raised many concerns. The endogenous
security issues of IoT networks focus on passive eavesdrop-
ping attacks and unknown malicious behaviors of nodes [1].
Nowadays, physical layer security and blockchain technologies
are regarded as promising endogenous security technologies to
achieve the traceability of malicious behaviors and conﬁden-
tiality of IoT networks, respectively [2]–[6].

One of the typical applications in IoT is the computation
ofﬂoading of sensor nodes, where the endogenous security
architecture is established to secure the ofﬂoading process [5],
[6]. Especially, smart contracts record the ofﬂoading process
participated by sensor nodes and mobile edge computing
(MEC) servers in the blockchain to ensure that transactions
cannot be denied and malicious computing result providers
will also be traced. IRS-assisted PLS can control the direction
of the electromagnetic wave to improve the secrecy capacity
between sensors and MEC servers. However,
the existing
computational resource allocation schemes are not suitable

in the architecture. Firstly, existing schemes usually focus on
the optimization of system performance, such as latency and
energy consumption minimization [7]–[10]. The Gas1 factor
just affects the block generation speed and is not considered
in computational resource allocation, leading to the dissatis-
faction of sensors because better resources are not allocated to
those sensors even if they pay high Gas. In addition, existing
investigation on IRS-assisted PLS neglects the expression
of ergodic secrecy rates [11], resulting in an inappropriate
resource allocation in time-varying wireless channels.

To address these problems mentioned above, we present
Gas-oriented computational resource allocation to guarantee
that the node paying higher Gas has more opportunities to
get a stronger computational resource. Also, the expression of
ergodic secrecy rate is deduced for the allocation process. The
main contributions of this work are summarized as follows.

• We formulate an endogenous security architecture for
computation ofﬂoading in IoT, where IRS-assisted PLS
and blockchain achieve the link security and traceability
of malicious behaviors, respectively.

• We deduce the expression of ergodic secrecy rate of IRS-
assisted PLS channels, which provides a global metric
of secrecy performance for the computational resource
allocation process.

• We design a Gas-based computational resource allocation
algorithm where sensors are divided into different groups
based on Gas payments, and the group with higher Gas
is prioritized with better computational resources.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the system model. The computation ofﬂoading
scheme is proposed in Section III. We show simulation results
in Section IV, and conclude this paper in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

This article considers a blockchain-empowered IoT net-
work, as shown in Fig. 1, which includes NI sensor nodes,
denoted by {U1, U2, ..., UNI }. Each sensor is equipped with
one antenna. A set of NK MEC servers, denoted by
{M1, M2, ..., MNK }, are associated with a single-antenna SBS

1Gas refers to the cost necessary to perform transactions on the Ethereum

blockchain

 
 
 
 
 
 
via wired links, and NK ≥ NI . All sensors and MEC
servers are registered in a public Ethereum network and follow
the rules of the Ethereum network. Due to the transmission
power constraints and the large-scale fading effect of sensor
communications, an IRS device is deployed to enhance the
quality of the uplink channel from sensors to the SBS.

Fig. 1: Joint physical layer security and blockchain-assisted compu-
tation ofﬂoading in IoT networks

As the computational resources of sensors are scarce, these
NI sensors ofﬂoad their computational
tasks, denoted by
{Z1, Z2, ..., ZNI }, to MEC servers via the wireless channels
between sensors and the SBS. After receiving tasks,
the
SBS allocates virtual machines provided by MEC servers to
execute these tasks. To record these tasks, sensors store the
indices of publishing tasks on the Ethereum via a contract
function, i.e., task publish contract(·), and the SBS stores the
indices of results on the Ethereum via the contract function
result record contract(·). Once the blocks of these contracts
are deployed on the Ethereum, no one can repudiate the debts
of transactions, and the results given by MEC servers are
recorded to avoid the attacks of malicious MEC servers. The
computation ofﬂoading process in the blockchain-empowered
IoT network is described as follows.

1) Transmitting tasks to the SBS: Ui sends the task data to
the SBS via IRS-assisted PLS schemes to resist eaves-
dropping attacks. To avoid the interference, sensors use
the time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology
during transmission processes.

2) Creating contracts of publishing tasks: At the same time
of task transmission, by following the contract format
of Ethereum, the sensor Ui launches a contract, i.e.,
#1 = task publish contract(Zi), which includes the
hash message corresponding to the ofﬂoaded task Zi
and the signature of Ui. Also,
the contract has the
address information of the transaction parties, Gas for
this transaction deﬁned by Vi, Gas price, etc. Then, the
contract #1 is broadcast in Ethereum.

3) Computing tasks in MEC server: After receiving tasks,
the SBS allocates computational resources of MEC
servers to perform these tasks. It is assumed that a task
uses one MEC server to compute results and an MEC
server can be allocated to only one task. At last, the
results are uploaded to the SBS for subsequent services.
4) Generating blocks of contracts of publishing tasks:
All nodes in Ethereum synchronize the transaction of
task publish contract(Zi), and check its format and

signature. If passing, nodes compete with each other to
win the right of charging the account of the transaction,
then the block is generated in Ethereum by winners.
All members registered in Ethereum desiring to get
payments can take part in the competition of account-
charging rights.

5) Creating contracts of recording results: Without
the task of Ui,

loss
i.e,
of generality, we assume that
is ofﬂoaded to the MEC server Mk. After
Zi,
completing the task, Mk launches a contract,
i.e.,
result record contract(Zi), which includes the hash
the signature of Mk,
message of recording results,
allocated computational resources, address information,
Gas for this transaction, Gas price, etc.

6) Generating blocks of contracts of recording results:
Similar to the block generation of contracts of publishing
tasks, all members registered in Ethereum can take
part in this competition of account-charging right. The
winner can obtain Gas as a payment.

In this system, the IoT service acquirer should pay sensors
and MEC servers because the original data is from sensors
and data process is done by MEC servers.

A. Communication Model

The article considers an IRS-assisted uplink communication
model with a passive single-antenna eavesdropper (Eve). The
IRS is equipped with N programmable phase shifter elements.
All channels are assumed to obey Rayleigh fading. The chan-
nel from Ui to Eve is deﬁned as gi ∼ CN (0, 1), the channel
from IRS to Eve is deﬁned as zH
i ∼ CN 1,N (0, IN ), the direct
link from Ui to SBS is deﬁned as li ∼ CN (0, 1), the channel
from Ui to IRS is deﬁned as hi ∼ CN N,1(0, IN ), and the
channel from IRS to SBS is deﬁned as aH
i ∼ CN 1,N (0, IN ).
The instantaneous CSIs of legitimate devices, including li,
hi, and aH
i , can be obtained via channel estimation perfectly,
whereas the instantaneous Eve’s CSIs gi and zH
i are unknown.
In this scenario, the TDMA technology is used, so inter-user
interference is not existed.

For the security purpose, IRS controls programmable phase
shifter elements via a phase shifter matrix, where the phase
shifter matrix for the transmission period of Ui is deﬁned as
an N × N matrix Φi, i.e.,

Φi = diag[exp(jθi,1), ..., exp(jθi,n), ..., exp(jθi,N )],

(1)

and θi,n ∈ [0, 2π) is the phase introduced by the nth phase
shifter element of IRS at the i-th period. With the phase shifter
matrix Φi, the received signals at the BS and Eve can be
expressed as

y = αi(li + aH
ye,i = αe,i(gi + zH

i Φihi)xi + ni,

i Φihi)xi + ne,i,

(2)

(3)

where diag(x) is the diagonal matrix of x, αi is the path
loss between the SBS and Ui, αe,i is the path loss between
the SBS and Eve, xi is the conﬁdential information-bearing
signal from Ui with E(|x|2) = Pi, and Pi is the transmission

(AWGN) obeying CN (0, σ2

i ) and CN (0, σ2

e,i), respectively.

B. Energy Consumption Model

The sensor Ui has the computation task Zi with Di-bits
data that should be uploaded to SBS. After receiving the task
data, the SBS will select an MEC server, such as Mk, to
perform the task of Ui. In this model, when Di-bits data are
calculated in Mk, the computing period is ckDi/fk, where ck
(CCN/bit) is the CPU cycle number (CCN) per bit processing
at Mk, and fk (CCN/s) is the CCN per second of Mk. The
energy consumption per second of Mk is ηkf 3
k (Joule/s),
where ηk is the computation energy efﬁciency coefﬁcient of
CPU chips in Mk. The transmission delay of uploading can
be expressed as Di/(RiB), where Ri (bit/s) is the ergodic
secrecy rate of uplink channels, and B is the bandwidth. The
energy consumption of Zi with the assistance of Mk can be
formulated as

MEC server is only assigned to one sensor. Eq. (10) is the
passive phase shifter constraint.

It is obvious that Φi, ∀i and W are independent variables
in optimization, and P1 is non-convex mixed-integer problem.
To tackle the problem, we transform P1 into two sub-problem,
i.e., phase shift optimization and computational resource allo-
cation, then solve them step-by-step.

III. COMPUTATION OFFLOADING SCHEME WITH
ASSISTANCE OF IRS AND MEC SERVER

A. Phase Shift Optimization

From Eq. (4), we can ﬁnd that the energy consumption Qi,k
decreases with the increasing ergodic secrecy rate Ri for all
sensors. Firstly, we should ﬁnd the optimal Φi to maximize
Ri, where Ri is given as follows [12],

Ri = [E(Cm,i) − E(Cw,i)]+
≤ E[(Cm,i − Cw,i)+)],

Qi,k = ηkDickf 2

where

(cid:18)

The computing modules of Ethereum are worldwide distribu-
tion, and are independent of the computation ofﬂoading sys-
tem, so the energy consumption of Ethereum is not considered
here.

C. Problem Formulation

Sensors paying higher Gas desire to get better computational
resources. Hence, we deﬁne the unsatisfactory degree of Ui
allocated Mk as follows,

Oi = Wi,k

(cid:20)
r(vi) − r

(cid:19)(cid:21)

(cid:18) fk

(5)

where Wi,k is the i-th row and k-th column of W. Wi,k is
a binary variable taking 1 when Mk is assigned to Ui, and
0 otherwise. r(vi) is the index of the descending order of
{v1, ..., vNI }, and r(fk/ck) is the index of the descending
order of {fk/ck, ..., fNI /cNI }. Here, NK − NI weaker com-
putational resources are abandoned.

The problem of the computation ofﬂoading focuses on the
energy consumption minimization with constraints of degrees
of satisfaction as follows.

and B is the bandwidth. {=} in Eq. (12) holds if and only if
the instantaneous secrecy rate {Cm,i − Cw,i} is nonnegative
in all channel state. Due to Eve’s CSI gi and z are unknown,
is hard to determine whether an instantaneous secrecy
it
rate is nonnegative or not, so we use the lower bound of
real ergodic secrecy rate as the performance metric for the
optimization process. The objective is to ﬁnd the optimal Φi
to achieve R∗
i for
the following computational resource allocation. However, it is
hard to maximize Ri as gi and z are unknown, so the objective
is transformed to maximize the channel capacity between Ui
and the SBS as follows,

i = maxΦ Ri and get the expression of R∗

From the investigation in [13], the optimal Φi of P2, i.e., Φ∗

can be found as follows,
i,n = θi − arg(aH
θ∗
i,n is the n-th diagonal element in Φ∗

where θ∗

expression of optimal ergodic secrecy rate of Ui with Φ∗

where Eq. (7) requires that the unsatisfactory degree of Ui
should be small than a threshold (cid:15), and (cid:15) ∈ [0, 1, ..., NI − 1]
that can be adjusted manually. Eq. (8) is the binary constraint
representing the allocation factor. Eq. (9) reveals that each
sensor can be allocated with only one MEC server, and each

Proof. The similar proof of Eqs. (18) and (21) can be found
in [14, Eq. (21)] and [14, Eq. (20)], respectively. Substituting
Eqs. (18) and (21) into Eq. (13), we can obtain the expression
(cid:4)
of optimal ergodic secrecy rate.

B. Gas-Oriented Computational Resource Allocation

The optimal computational resource allocation is found by

grouping and matching algorithms.

In order to meet

1) Grouping process:

the satisfactory
degree of each sensor, i.e., constraint (7), the sensors are sort as
} where their Gas obey V1(cid:48) ≥ V2(cid:48) ≥ ... ≥
{U1(cid:48), U2(cid:48), ..., UN (cid:48)
(cid:15)+1 (cid:101) groups. Each group
VN (cid:48)
includes (cid:15) + 1 members as follows,

, and are grouped into T = (cid:100) NI

the last sensor group has {NI − (T − 1)((cid:15) +

the MEC servers are sort as

I

(cid:123)
} .

...,

(24)

The last MEC group has {NI − (T − 1)((cid:15) + 1)} members.
The MEC server in the t-th MEC group is only allocated to
the t-th sensor group, and the sensor in the t-th sensor group
can only uses computational resources in the t-th MEC group.
From Eq. (5), we can ﬁnd that r(vi) − r(fk/ck) ≤ (cid:15) for any
sensor and MEC server pair, so the constraint (7) is satisﬁed.
2) Matching process: Without loss of generality, we deﬁne
St = {[(t − 1)(cid:15) + t](cid:48), ..., t((cid:15) + 1)(cid:48)} and Mt = {[(t −
1)(cid:15) + t](cid:48)(cid:48), ..., t((cid:15) + 1)(cid:48)(cid:48)} as the indices of the members in
the t-th sensor group and the t-th MEC group. Then, we
use Theorem 1 to calculate optimal ergodic secrecy rates
i , ∀i ∈ St. With the parameters
of all sensors,
{ηk, ck, fk, Di, Pi, R∗
i }, ∀i ∈ St, ∀k ∈ Mt, we can calculate
Qi,k via Eq. (4) for each given sensor and MEC server pair,
and generate a matrix Q to record Qi,k, ∀i ∈ St, ∀k ∈ Mt.

where Wt,i,k is the i-th row and k-th column of Wt. Wt,i,k
is a binary variable taking 1 when Mk in t-th MEC group is
assigned to Ui in the t-th sensor group, and 0 otherwise. Eq.
(27) reveals that each sensor can be allocated with only one
MEC server, and each MEC server is only assigned to one
sensor. P3 is convex and the optimal Wt can be solved by
the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm [15]. Even if the number
of dimensional in the last group is different from the formers,
computational resource allocation in all T sensor and MEC
groups, including the last group, can be optimized via the KM
algorithm.

C. Computational Complexity Analysis

In the phase optimization process, Since Eq. (16) requires
2N iterations, the computational complexity to get Φ∗
i , ∀i
is O(2N NI ). The computational resource allocation requires
} and
two bubble sort algorithms to get {U1(cid:48), U2(cid:48), ..., UN (cid:48)
{M1(cid:48)(cid:48) , M2(cid:48)(cid:48) , ..., MN (cid:48)(cid:48)
I iterations.
The KM algorithm needs ((cid:15)+1)4 iterations in each group pair
[15]. In total, the computational complexity of the ofﬂoading
process is O[2N NI + 2N 2

}, each of which needs N 2

I + T ((cid:15) + 1)4].

IV. SIMULATIONS

The global simulation parameters are described as follows.
c
The path loss parameter αi is calculated by αi =
,
2πfcdi
where c is the speed of light, fc is work spectrum that is
set to 2.4 GHz, di is the distance between the SBS and Ui
is set to be uniform distribution over [30 m, 50 m]. The
i and σ2
AWGN ﬂoor parameters σ2
e,i are -53 dBm [16]. The
transmission power Pi, ∀i is 10 dBm. The computation energy
efﬁciency coefﬁcient ηk, ∀k is set to be 10−27. The CCN per
bit processing ck, ∀k is set to be 10 CCN/bit. Note that all
simulation results are average values from 105 independent
runs.

Here, we examine Theorem 1 in terms of the number
of IRS elements in Fig. 2. These ﬁgures show the good
agreements between theoretical results (Theo.) of Eq. (17)
and Monte Carlo (MC.) simulation results of Eq. (13) from
105 independent runs. From this ﬁgure, we can ﬁnd that the
optimal ergodic secrecy rate increases with the increasing
number of IRS elements. Also, a comparison is taken between
IRS-assisted PLS and the secure beamforming scheme that
uses Nt = N + 1 antennas [12]. From the comparison
simulations, we ﬁnd that the IRS-assisted PLS outperforms

terms of the number of IRS elements.

sors in terms of the length of bandwidth.

the secure beamforming scheme because channel gain by IRS
is larger than that of the beamforming scheme [14].

Fig. 3 shows the bandwidth effect on the sum energy
consumption of 40 sensors, where (cid:15) = 9. fk, Di, and Vi
are uniform distributions over [40 GHz, 80 GHz], [610 KB
1.8 MB], and [1.5 × 106, 2 × 106] . It is demonstrated that
the sum energy consumption decreases with the increasing
bandwidth, because data transmission time is reduced with
more bandwidth. Also, the proposed scheme outperforms the
bidding scheme (the highest bidder obtains), but has worse
performance than energy consumption minimization (ECM)
schemes [7], [8]. From the red and blue lines, we can ﬁnd
the proposed scheme just raises 4% enough consumption
compared to ECM. Fig. 4 with the simulation parameters of
Fig. 3 is used to check whether sensors are satisﬁed. We
can ﬁnd the probabilities of the satisfaction of the proposed
scheme and bidding scheme is equal to one, meaning that
sensors are satisﬁed. However, the provided Gas has no rela-
tionship with computational resource allocation in the ECM
schemes, so the probability of Oi ≤ (cid:15) is equal to 1/T , where
T = NI /((cid:15) + 1) = 10 in this simulation.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we propose an endogenous security archi-
tecture for computation ofﬂoading in IoT, which not only
provides the ability to trace unknown malicious behaviors of
nodes by blockchain technology, but also uses PLS to protect
the uplink channel from sensors to MEC servers against
passive eavesdropping attacks. The feature of the proposed
scheme is that the group with higher Gas is prioritized with
better computational resources. The simulations demonstrate
that the proposed scheme guarantees that the node paying
higher Gas has more opportunities to get a stronger com-
putational resource, and just raises 4% energy consumption
in comparison with ECM schemes. In future works, we will
integrate multiple antenna technologies into this system as it
is a promising method to improve security performance.
