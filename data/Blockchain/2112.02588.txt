in Bitcoin and Ethereum

Abstract—Bitcoin and Ethereum are the top two blockchain-based cryptocurrencies whether from cryptocurrency market cap or popularity. 
However, they are vulnerable to selfish mining and stubborn mining due to that both of them adopt Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. In 
this paper, we develop a novel Markov model, which can study selfish mining and seven kinds of stubborn mining in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
The formulas are derived to calculate several key metrics, including relative revenue of miners, blockchain performance in terms of stale block 
ratio  and  transactions  per  second,  and  blockchain  security  in  terms  of  resistance  against  double-spending  attacks.  Numerical  analysis  is 
conducted to investigate the quantitative relationship between the relative-revenue-optimal mining strategy for malicious miners and two miner 
features in Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. The quantitative analysis results can assist honest miners in detecting whether there is any 
malicious miner in the system and setting the threshold of mining node’s hash power in order to prevent malicious miners from making profit 
through selfish and stubborn mining.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Bitcoin and Ethereum are now the two largest and most popular 
blockchain-based  cryptocurrencies  in  the  world  [1][2].  They 
both  employ  the  most  widely  used  consensus  mechanism, 
Proof-of-Work  (PoW).  In  a  PoW  blockchain  system,  a  large 
number of miners mine blocks by trying to solve a math puzzle 
and the miner who first solves the puzzle wins the right to add 
the next block to the blockchain. The power of miners solving 
puzzles is denoted as hash power. The miner who produces a 
regular block (a block which is in the main chain) is rewarded 
with  a  pre-defined  number  of  tokens  which  are  known  as  a 
mining reward. To increase the chance of producing a block and 
then getting a reward, several miners can form a mining pool 
and conduct cooperative mining. In a PoW system, the difficulty 
of mining a block is usually adjusted to alleviate the impact of 
the varying hash power and other factors on the regular block 
generation time (10 min in Bitcoin and 13 sec in Ethereum [3]). 
This adjustment mechanism is denoted as difficulty adjustment. 
PoW blockchain faces many security threats, such as double-
spending attack [4], eclipses attack [5] and selfish mining attack 
[6]. Pow Blockchain security incidents have been reported over 
the  past  few  years.  In  2016,  attackers  managed  to  attack  ‘The 
DAO’  and  stolen  over  50  million  USD  of  Ethers  (the  native 
cryptocurrency  of  Ethereum)  [7].  Bitfinex,  a  cryptocurrency 
exchange,  lost  about  120,000  Bitcoins  in  2016  [8].  In  2018,  five 
blockchain-based cryptocurrencies lost 5 million  USD because 
of  51%  attack  [9].  Ethereum  Classic  suffered  selfish  mining  in 
2019 [10].  

This paper focuses on two types of malicious mining, namely, 
selfish and stubborn mining which are detailed in Sec. 3.1. There 
are  two  types  of  miners,  honest  and  malicious  miners.  The 
former  type  always  adopts  the  honest  mining  strategy  to 
conduct honest mining, namely, always mining in the longest 
branch  and  publishing  a  block  immediately  after  being 
produced.  The  latter  type  forms  a  Malicious  Pool  (MP)  to  get 
more undeserved mining revenue (the total reward for a mining 
node, which is an individual miner or a mining pool). Different 

from  honest  miners,  the  malicious  pool  can  conduct  honest 
mining by adopting the honest mining strategy or can conduct 
malicious mining by a malicious mining strategy, depending on 
their hash power and other factors. If a block is produced by the 
MP, it can be published strategically instead of being published 
immediately.  

Fig. 1 Two examples of the differences between the honest mining strategy 
and  a  malicious  mining  strategy  .  The  numbers  next  to  the  blocks 
denote the order of the blocks produced.  

Malicious  mining  can  lead  to  hash  power  waste  and  then 
honest  miners  getting  less  mining  revenue.  Fig.  1  gives  two 
examples  to  illustrate  the  block  chains  when  the  MP  employs 
malicious and honest mining strategies in Bitcoin, respectively. 
In  Example  1  (shown  in  Fig.  1-a  and  Fig.  1-c),  five  blocks  are 
produced  in  numerical  order.  Fig.  1-a  indicates  that  under  a 
malicious strategy, the branch with three blocks all produced by 
the MP is the main chain. Since only blocks on the main chain 
can bring reward and the reward of each regular block is same, 
the relative revenue of the MP is 100%. Here, relative revenue 
[6] of a mining node represents the share of this node in the total 
mining  revenue  of  all  nodes.  The  blocks  generated  by  honest 
miners  are  both  stale  blocks  (the  blocks  which  are  not  in  the 
main chain), which means that the hash power of honest miners 
is wasted. Fig. 1-c illustrates the situation that the MP employs 
the honest mining strategy. We can see that the relative revenue 
of the MP is 60%. Thus, the MP can get more relative revenue

(100%,  as  opposed  to  60%  for  honest  mining)  by  using  a 
malicious mining strategy.  

However, a malicious mining strategy does not always bring 
more  relative  revenue  to  the  MP  than  the  honest  mining 
strategy. See Example 2 (shown in Fig. 1-b and Fig. 1-d). In this 
example,  the  MP  fails  to  create  a  main  chain  and  its  relative 
revenue is 0%. That is, in Example 2, the MP using a malicious 
strategy gains lower revenue than the honest mining strategy. 
From Fig. 1, we make two conclusions about malicious mining: 
① The MP cannot produce more regular blocks when it adopts 
a  malicious  mining  strategy  than  using  the  honest  mining 
strategy.  Hence,  malicious  mining  can  increase  the  relative 
revenue of the MP. ② When the MP adopts a malicious strategy, 
the growth rate of the main chain is much lower than using the 
honest  mining  strategy.  Namely,  malicious  mining  causes  an 
increase in the regular block generation time.  

In  this  paper,  we  aim  to  understand  and  quantitatively 
analyze  the  above  two  conclusions.  We  evaluate  mining 
revenue  from  the  perspective  of  relative  revenue.  Malicious 
mining not only depresses the revenue of honest miners but also 
creates  several  stale  blocks,  which  degrades  the  overall 
performance and security of the system.  

Stochastic modeling is an effective quantitative approach [12]. 
Researchers  have  conducted  model-based  analyses  of  selfish 
and  stubborn  mining  attacks  against  blockchain  systems.  But 
they  only  considered  attacks  in  Bitcoin  ([6][13][14][15][18]),  or 
only  studied  relative  revenue  of  malicious  miners  ([3][6][16]-
[20]), or ignored the impact of malicious mining on blockchain 
performance and security ([6][13]-[15][17]-[20]). In our work, we 
propose a Markov model to quantitatively evaluate the impact 
of selfish and stubborn mining not only on mining revenue of 
miners  but  also  on  the  system  performance  and  security  in 
Bitcoin and Ethereum.  

The  main  contributions  of  this  work  are  summarized  as 

follows. 

1)  We develop a novel Markov model, which can be applied 
to investigate eight kinds of malicious mining in Bitcoin 
and  Ethereum.  Malicious  miners  can  employ  either  the 
honest  mining  strategy  or  a  malicious  mining  strategy, 
which is the selfish mining strategy or one of the seven 
kinds of stubborn mining strategies. These strategies are 
detailed in Sec. 3. To the best of our knowledge, ours is 
the  first  model  which  can  analyze  eight  kinds  of 
malicious mining strategies in Bitcoin and Ethereum. 
2)  We derive the formulas to calculate relative revenue for 
honest  miners  and  malicious  miners  in  Bitcoin  and 
Ethereum,  respectively.  Ethereum  mining  revenue 
comprises  three  kinds  of  rewards,  but  Bitcoin  mining 
revenue comprises only one kind reward. The analysis of 
relative  revenue  has  three  major  benefits:  ①   Provide 
quantitative  relationship  between  the  relative-revenue-

optimal  mining  strategy  for  malicious  miners  and  two 
miner  features,  including  the  ratio  of  honest  miners 
mining  in  the  private  branch  when  two  blocks  are 
published simultaneously and hash power of malicious 
miners in Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. ② Provide 
guidelines to honest miners about setting the threshold 
of  mining  node’s  hash  power  to  prevent  malicious 
miners from profiting by selfish and stubborn mining. ③ 
Help honest miners design a reward mechanism to resist 
malicious mining. 
the 

formulas 

3)  We  derive 

for  calculating  system 
performance  and  security  metrics,  including  the  stale 
block  ratio,  transactions  per  second,  and  the  resistance 
against double-spending attacks. With these metrics, we 
can  evaluate  the  impact  of  malicious  mining  on  the 
blockchain  system  and  help  honest  miners  detect 
whether  there  are  any  malicious  miners  in  the  system. 
Our  investigation  of  the  public  literature  indicates  that 
we are the first to evaluate the impact of stubborn mining 
on Bitcoin and Ethereum performance and security. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 presents 
related  works.  We  describe  the  system  and  the  developed 
model  and  metric  formulas  in  Sec.  3.  Sec.  4  shows  the 
experiment  results.  Conclusions  and  future  work  are  given  in 
Sec. 5.  

2. RELATED WORK 
Since selfish mining was proposed by Eyal et al. [6], a number 
of  researches  were  proposed  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  selfish 
mining on blockchain. Göbel et al. [13] analyzed the probability 
that honest miners mine blocks in the branch of selfish miners. 
Bai et al. [14] proposed a Markov model to evaluate the mining 
revenue  for  a  selfish  pool  when  there  are  two  selfish  pools  in 
Bitcoin. Davidson et al. [15] conducted simulations to study the 
effect  of  selfish  mining  under  different  difficulty  adjustment 
algorithms. Ritz et al. [16] also applied simulation to investigate 
the selfish mining in Ethereum. Feng et al. [17] proposed a two-
dimensional Markov model which can describe selfish mining 
in  Ethereum  and  they  considered  the  Ethereum  reward 
mechanism.  Yang  et  al.  [3]  analyzed  selfish  mining  in  an 
imperfect  Ethereum  network  and  evaluated  the  impact  of 
selfish  mining  on  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum  system  performance 
and  security.  In  this  paper,  when  we  analyze  the  impact  of 
malicious mining on blockchain security, we consider a scenario 
that is different from [3]. Our scenario gets more accurate results, 
and the details are given in Sec. 3.3. All the above works only 
considered  selfish  mining.  In  this  paper,  we  analyze  not  only 
selfish mining but also stubborn mining.  

Stubborn mining is another kind of malicious mining, which 
can  outperform  selfish  mining  in  some  situations  from  the 
aspect of relative revenue of the MP. Stubborn mining has been 
studied  by  researchers.  Nayak  et  al.  [18]  proposed  a  group  of 
attacks, including three kinds of basic stubborn mining and four 
kinds  of  hybrid  stubborn  mining,  which  are  analyzed  in  our 

 
paper.  Wang  et  al.  [19]  analyzed  the  selfish  mining  and  two 
kinds  of  stubborn  mining  in  Ethereum.  Liu  et  al.  [20]  applied 
Monte  Carlo  simulation 
to  evaluate  stubborn  miners' 
profitability in Ethereum. In this paper, besides mining revenue, 
we  analyze  the  impact  of  malicious  mining  on  blockchain 
performance and security by modeling approach.  

The fast development of blockchain technology exposes it to 
a  range  of  security  threats,  and  many  researchers  have  been 
committed  to  building  a  healthy  blockchain.  Li  et  al.  [21] 
surveyed  the  security  risks  of  blockchain  system  and  divided 
the risks into nine categories. Chen et al. [22] divided Ethereum 
system into four layers and draw insights into the vulnerability, 
attack,  and  defense  of  the  four-layer  architecture  Ethereum. 
Ghosh et al. [23] reported various aspects related to blockchain, 
including  taxonomy,  application  scenarios,  vulnerabilities, 
attacks, and defensive methodologies. Different from them, we 
aim to quantitatively study malicious mining.  

In  the  past  years,  except  for  selfish  and  stubborn  mining 
attacks  proposed  in  [6]  and  [18],  researchers  have  explored 
other  attacks  against  the  PoW  blockchain  system,  such  as 
combined  double-spending  with  Sybil  attack  [24],  balance 
attack [25], block withholding attack [26], fork after withholding 
attack  [27],  and  intermittent  block  withholding  attack  [11].  In 
addition, variants of selfish and stubborn mining attacks were 
developed [28]-[31]. We leave the quantitative analysis of these 
attacks for future work.  

3. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND MODEL 
This  section  first  presents  the  PoW  system  to  be  studied  and 
then  the  analytic  model  and  the  formulas  are  given.  The 
definitions of the notations to be used are given in TABLE 1.  

3.1 System Description 

In the system, there are a large number of miners mining blocks. 
We assume that the total hash power of all miners is constant. 
The height of a block (block height) is defined as the number of 
regular  blocks  preceding  this  block  in  the  blockchain.  In  the 
system,  the  MP  can  withhold  a  block  until  honest  miners 
publish a block. For example, at a point, all miners are mining 
on  the  block  with  height 
.  The  MP  produces  a  block  at 
 firstly  but  withholds  it.  Shortly  after  that,  honest 
height 
miners  generate  a  block  at  height 
 too  and  then  the  MP 
publishes their block. At this time, two blocks are at the same 
height 
,  and  then  a  fork  occurs,  which  consists  of  a  public 
branch (created by honest miners) and a private branch (created 
by the MP). 

Consensus block denotes the last block which is validated by 
all  miners.  The  length  of  the  public  (private)  branch  is  the 
number of blocks in the public (private) branch. Let 
 denote 
the length difference between the public branch and the private 
 to  denote 
branch.  Here

honest  miners  can  mine  blocks  on  either  of  them.  Fig.  2  gives

mining  (F-s),  and  trail  stubborn  mining  (T-s)  strategy.  The 
following  details  the  actions  of  the  MP  under  the  three  basic 
stubborn mining strategies.  

• L-s  strategy:  If 

and  honest  miners  produce  a  block, 
the  MP  only  publishes  the  first  unpublished  block  (L-s 
strategy)  instead  of  publishing  the  whole  private  branch 
(selfish mining strategy) (Fig. 4-a).  

• F-s  strategy:  If 

 and  the  MP  generates  a  block,  it 
keeps  the  new  block  secret  (F-s  strategy)  instead  of 
publishing the block (selfish mining strategy) (Fig. 4-b).  

• T-s strategy: If 

 and honest miners create a block in 
the public branch, the MP continues mining in the private 
branch (T-s strategy) instead of mining on the new block 
(selfish mining strategy) (Fig. 4-c). When the MP employs 
T-s  strategy,  it  is  possible  that 
 and  the 
MP generates a block, the lengths of the two branches are 
equal. However, at this time, all honest miners mine blocks 
in the public branch, because they receive the block in the

public branch first, and we use 

.  If 

Before presenting the behaviors of honest miners and the MP, 
we first give the definitions of uncle blocks and nephew blocks, 
both of which are used in Ethereum. If a stale block (B0) is the 
direct child of a regular block and it is referenced by a regular 
block  (B1),  the  block  (B0)  is  called  an  uncle  block.  The  regular 
block (B1) is called the nephew block. Namely, nephew block is 
a kind of regular block, and uncle block is a kind of stale block. 
In  Ethereum,  an  uncle  block  can  only  be  referenced  by  one 
regular block, and a regular block can reference up to two uncle 
blocks.  

1)  Honest miner behaviors  

Usually, the number of honest miners is very large, and honest 
miners  control  the  majority  of  hash  power  in  a  blockchain 
system. Honest miners adopt the honest mining strategy: ① An 
honest  miner  always  mines  blocks  in  the  longest  chain  which 
he/she  can  see;  ②  they  always  publish  a  block  as  soon  as  the 
block is produced; and ③ in Ethereum, honest miners reference 
uncle blocks as many as they can (no more than two). Therefore, 
if there are two blocks (denoted as BA and BB) that are published 
almost at the same time, a part of honest miners receive BA first 
and mine on it, and the rest honest miners mine blocks on block 
BB.  

2)  The malicious pool behaviors 

The  MP  can  adopt  the  honest  mining  strategy  or  a  malicious 
mining strategy (the selfish mining strategy or stubborn mining 
strategies). Stubborn mining is a variant of selfish mining. The 
selfish mining strategy was given in [3][6].  

Fig. 3 An example that using a stubborn mining strategy outperforms using 

the selfish mining strategy.  

Fig. 4 The  differences  between  each  of  three  basic  stubborn  mining 

strategies and the selfish mining strategy.  

When the MP employs the selfish mining strategy, the MP can 
gain  an  advantage  at  some  time,  which  means  the  private 
branch  is  longer  than  the  public  branch.  If  the  MP  adopts  the 
selfish  mining  strategy,  the  MP  gives  up  its  advantage  (by 
publishing  its  unpublished  blocks)  or  gives  up  the  private 
branch (by accepting the public branch) in three cases: ①
and honest miners produce a block, ②
a  block,  and  ③
public branch.  

and the MP creates 
 and  honest  miners  create  a  block  in  the 

It is possible that the MP can get more relative revenue under 
some  circumstances  if  it  does  not  give  up  its  advantage  or  its 
private branch. For example, in Fig. 3, five blocks are produced 
in  numerical  order.  If  the  MP  continues  mining  on  the  block 
marked ‘1’ when the block marked ‘5’ is produced, it gets more 
relative  revenue  (100%),  as  opposed  to  50%  in  Bitcoin  (and 
about  59%  in  Ethereum)  for  selfish  mining  strategy.  Thus, 
stubborn  mining  is  proposed.  There  are  three  basic  stubborn 
strategies,  Lead-stubborn  mining  (L-s),  equal  fork-stubborn 

Fig. 4 illustrates the difference between each basic stubborn 
mining  strategy  and  the  selfish  mining  strategy.  The  basic 
stubborn mining strategies are not mutually exclusive, and four 
hybrid  stubborn  mining  strategies  are  generated  by  combing 
them. That is LF-s, LT-s, FT-s and LFT-s strategy. However, in 
[18],  the  hybrid  strategies  were  not  introduced  in  detail.  For 
example, when the MP adopts FT-s strategy, 
 and the MP 
produces  a  block,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  new  block  will  be 
published.  According  to  [19],  we  define  that the  block  will  be 
published in this case. In the remainder of this paper, we specify 
multiple strategies using wildcard characters. For example, L*-
s denotes L-s, LF-s, LT-s and LFT-s. In Ethereum, the MP does 
not reference any uncle blocks to decrease the revenue of honest 
miners and increases the relative revenue of the MP.

1)  Relative revenue of the malicious pool 

In  a  PoW  blockchain,  miners  can  get  rewards  when  they 
produce  a  block.  In  Bitcoin  system,  there  is  only  one  kind 
mining reward, namely, static block reward. However, miners 
can get three kinds of mining rewards in Ethereum, including 
static  block  reward,  uncle  reward,  and  nephew  reward.  If  the 
MP adopts the honest mining strategy, the relative revenue is 
equal to the proportion of miners’ hash power of the total hash 
power.  The  mining  rewards  when  the  MP  employs  malicious 
mining strategy are given as follows. Without loss of generality, 
we normalize a static block reward as 1. 

First, we calculate the static block reward for the MP, and the 

formula is given in Eq. (1).

respectively.

Next, we compute the static block reward for honest miners 

(denoted as 

).  

(6) 

Based  on  Eq.  (1)  and  Eq.  (6),  we  can  obtain  the  relative 
revenues  for  honest  miners  and  the  MP  in  Bitcoin.  They  are 
given in Eq. (7) and Eq. (8), respectively.

 , where 

(13) 

(14) 

However, in Ethereum, uncle reward and nephew reward are 
ineligible. Eq. (9) gives the uncle reward function, where 
is an 
integer and denotes the difference in block height between the 
uncle block and nephew block (reference distance).  

The uncle reward for the MP is given in Eq. (10).  

The uncle reward for honest miners is given in Eq. (11). 

(9) 

(10) 

(11) 

where 

In  Eq.  (11), 

.  The  detailed  proofs  of 

the correctness of Eq. (1), Eq. (6), Eq. (10), and Eq. (11) are given 
in  proposition  1–  4  in  Appendix  B  of  the  supplementary  file, 
respectively.  

The  uncle  reward  is  equal  to  the  product  of  the  number  of 
uncle  blocks  and  the  corresponding  uncle  reward  function  in 
, the uncle reward 
each case. Thus, if 

 for

is equal to the expected number of uncle blocks. Namely, 

 is 

expressed as in Eq. (12) when 

 for 

.  

(12) 

The creator of the nephew block can get an additional reward, 
which is the nephew reward. As mentioned above, the MP does 

not reference uncle blocks and therefore 

. Thus, all uncle 

blocks are referenced by the blocks which are created by honest 
miners. A nephew reward is awarded for referencing an uncle 
block. Thus, the nephew reward for honest miners is given  in 
Eq. (14).  

With the formulas for calculating three kinds of rewards for 
honest miners (Eq. (6), Eq. (11), and Eq. (14)) and those for the 
MP (Eq. (1), Eq. (10), and Eq. (13)) in Ethereum, we can obtain 
the relative revenue for honest miners (in Eq. (15)) and the MP 
(in Eq. (16)) in Ethereum, respectively.  

(15) 

(16) 

2)  Stale block ratio 

Stale blocks have a significant impact on blockchain difficulty 
adjustment, system performance and security, and therefore the 
stale block ratio is a key metric. The regular block creator can 
get static block rewards, so the regular block number is equal to 
the static block rewards. Assume that the expected number of 
blocks being produced in a block generation time is 1. Then, the 
mean  number  of  regular  blocks  being  producing  in  a  block 

generation time is 

. Thus, we obtain the stale block ratio, 

given in Eq. (17). 

3)  Transactions per second 

(17) 

Malicious  mining  also  has  an  impact  on  system  performance. 
Ethereum  and  Bitcoin  can  both  be  payment  systems,  and 
transactions  per  second  (TPS)  is  a  key  metric  that  is  used  to 
denote  the  system  throughput.  In  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum,  only 
the transactions in the regular blocks can be accounted, and the 
transactions in stale blocks are sent back to the transaction pool. 
 denote the number of transactions in a block 
Let 

 and 

and the block generation time, respectively. Then, we obtain the 
formula for calculating TPS for the system is given in Eq. (18).   
(18) 

4)  Resistance against double-spending attack 

In the PoW blockchain, a large number of miners and massive 
hash  power  can  protect  the  blockchain  system  against  several 
attacks,  such  as  double-spending  attack,  which  is  regarded  as 
the  largest  security  challenge  of  the  blockchain  system. 
However,  malicious  mining  can  reduce  system  security 
resistance capability by causing more stale blocks in the system, 
which wastes a lot of resources.  

We consider a scenario that besides honest miners and the MP 
in the system that there is a pool (DS pool) launching double-
spending attack, and this scenario is abbreviated as ‘SDS’. There 
are two groups of miners in SDS. Group 1 (G1) consists of honest 
miners and the MP, and group 2 (G2) consists of the DS pool. 
The DS pool mines blocks secretly unless it attacks successfully, 
so  G1  is  not  aware  of  G2,  and  G1  can  be  regarded  as  an 
, 
independent system. Namely, the total hash power of G1 is

4. ANALYSIS RESULTS 
This section shows the analysis results. First, we use numerical 
analysis to study mining revenue in Sec. 4.1, the stale block ratio 
in Sec. 4.2, and the impacts of malicious mining on performance 
and security in Sec. 4.3 and Sec. 4.4. In this section, we normalize 
)  in  the  system  as  1.  The  numerical 
the  total  hash  power  (

Comparing  with  mining  honestly,  the  MP  can  get  more 
relative revenue by malicious mining when the hash power of 
the MP is larger than a threshold. To avoid the MP to get unfair 
revenue by malicious mining, honest miners can set a threshold 
to  limit  the  hash  power  of  the  MP.  Thus,  it  is  important  to 
determine  the  hash  power  threshold.  Fig.  6  shows  the  hash

threshold of selfish mining is 0.25, which is lower than that of 
the  left  malicious  strategies.  The  hash  power  threshold  of 
Ethereum is lower than that in Bitcoin, which means that selfish 
. In addition, 
mining is easier to get unfair revenue when 
when 
,  the  threshold  in  Bitcoin  is  larger  than  that  in 
Ethereum no matter what the strategy is used by the MP. This 
is  because  the  Ethereum  reward  mechanism  compensates  the 
miners who produce stale blocks, which make the MP easier to 
attack Ethereum than attack Bitcoin by malicious mining.  

4.2 Stale Block Analysis 

In a PoW blockchain system, the more the total hash power, the 
more secure and dependable the system. In our system, the stale 
blocks  ratio  is  0  when  there  are  no  malicious  miners  in  the 
system.  If  the  MP  starts  to  attack  the  blockchain  system  by 
malicious  mining,  stale  blocks  are  created.  In  Fig.  7,  we  show 
the stale block ratio when the hash power of the MP is 0.3, and 
the  network  capacity  is  0.5  over  different  malicious  mining 
strategies. As shown in Fig. 7, stubborn mining can cause more 
stale  blocks  than  selfish  mining.  Namely,  stubborn  mining 
strategies have more impact on the system than selfish mining. 
This  is  because  stubborn  miners  do  not  give  up  their  private 
 and 
branch when selfish miners  may  give up. When 

,  the  MP  adopting  stubborn  mining  strategies  get  less 
relative  revenue  than  adopting  the  selfish  mining  strategy. 
Therefore,  the  MP  should  not  employ  stubborn  mining 
strategies in this situation, because it is harmful to both honest 
and malicious miners.

4.3 Blockchain Performance Analysis 

Malicious  miners  not  only  get  undeserved  revenue,  but  also 
have a marked impact on blockchain system performance when 
they attack the system. If there is not malicious miner in Bitcoin

 and  adopts  the  selfish  mining  strategy  when 

 and

than  the  selfish  mining  due  to  the  high  stale  block  ratio.  The 
formulas  for  calculating  TPS  of  Bitcoin  is  the  same  as  that  of

Fig. 10  Resistance  to  double-spending  attack  in  Ethereum  when  the  MP 

adopts LFT-s strategy. 

Malicious  mining  also  degrades  the  overall  security  of 
blockchain system.  Due to the limited space, we do not show 
the impact of all malicious mining strategies on system security. 
We evaluate the impact of LF-s mining on Bitcoin security as an 
example (Fig. 9) and the impact of LFT-s mining on Ethereum 
security is shown in Fig. 10. The number of confirmation blocks 
in Bitcoin is 6, and that in Ethereum is 12 [3]. Both in Fig. 9 and 
Fig. 10, when we fix the hash power ratio of G2, the probability 
of  double-spending  success  increases,  which  means  that 

malicious mining greatly reduces the security of blockchain and 
makes  the  blockchain  system  more  susceptible  to  double-
spending attack.  

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
This  paper  quantitatively  analyzes  several  kinds  of  malicious 
mining strategies in Bitcoin and Ethereum systems by building 
a  Markov  model.  In  Bitcoin,  miners  can  get  one  kind  mining 
reward (namely, static block reward), but miners in  Ethereum 
can  earn  three  kinds  of  mining  rewards  (namely,  static  block 
reward,  uncle  reward,  and  nephew  reward).  We  derive 
formulas of these rewards, based on which we derive formulas 
of computing mining relative revenue for honest and malicious 
miners, respectively. Moreover, the impact of malicious mining 
on performance and security is studied in Bitcoin and Ethereum.  
The  past  years  witnessed  more  than  one  hundred  kinds  of 
PoW  blockchain  based  cryptocurrencies  developed,  including 
several  cryptocurrencies  forked  from  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum 
(such  as  Bitcoin  Cash,  Bitcoin  Gold,  Ethereum  Classic)  and 
altcoins (such as Litecoin and DASH). There are fewer miners in 
these  cryptocurrencies,  which  causes  that  they  are  more 
susceptible  to  malicious  mining.  One  of  our  future  work 
direction  is  to  apply  our  model  and  formulas  to  study  the 
cryptocurrencies forked from Bitcoin and Ethereum. In addition, 
this paper ignores forks which are created by honest miners due 
to block propagation delay. However, in a realistic blockchain 
system,  the  block  propagation  delay  does  exist  [33][34], 
especially in Ethereum network. We plan to extend our model 
and formulas to imperfect networks and evaluate the impact of 
block propagation delay on malicious mining. As mentioned in 
Sec.  2,  besides  selfish  and  stubborn  mining,  there  are  other 
attacks  against  block  mining  in  PoW  blockchain  systems.  The 
quantitative analysis of those attacks is also a direction of our 
future work.
