Abstract. Propagating information to more people through their friends
is becoming an increasingly important technology used in domains such
as blockchain, advertising, and social media. To incentivize people to
broadcast the information, the designer may use a monetary rewarding
scheme, which speciﬁes who gets how much, to compensate for the prop-
agation. Several properties are desirable for the rewarding scheme, such
as budget feasible, individually rational, incentive compatible and Sybil-
proof. In this work, we design a free market with lotteries, where every
participant can decide by herself how much of the reward she wants to
withhold before propagating to others. We show that in the free mar-
ket, the participants have a strong incentive to maximally propagate the
information and all the above properties are satisﬁed automatically.

Introduction

Propagating information to more people through their friends is becoming an
increasingly important technique used in many ﬁelds including advertising, so-
cial media [12] and blockchain [3,14]. To incentivize people to broadcast the
information, the information holder, i.e., the mechanism designer, may use a
monetary rewarding scheme r = (r1, · · · , rn) to compensate people, where ri is
the reward assigned to player i. The rewarding scheme is expected to satisfy
several properties, such as being incentive compatible, (strongly) budget feasible,
individual rational, and Sybil-proof. Informally, incentive compatibility requires
that each player does not decrease her utility by propagating the information,
budget feasibility requires (cid:80)
i ri ≤ B when the mechanism designer has a budget
of B, strong budget feasibility requires (cid:80)
i ri = B, individual rationality requires

ri ≥ 0 for all i, and Sybil-proofness requires the players do not beneﬁt by mak-
ing fake copies in the information propagation process. Accordingly, designing
a rewarding scheme to satisfy all or some of the above properties establishes
a large research agenda. For example, maximal information propagation with
budgets is studied in [26], where a rewarding scheme that is incentive compati-
ble, strongly budget feasible and individual rational is proposed. But the scheme
is not Sybil-proof. A Sybil-proof rewarding scheme is designed in [6], but it is
not strongly budget feasible, where a small portion of the claimed reward is
distributed among the players. In this work, instead of designing a centralized
rewarding scheme, we propose a free market with lotteries where everyone can
decide how much of the reward she wants to withhold before propagating to oth-
ers. We show that in such a market, the players have strong incentives to fully
propagate the information and all above properties are satisﬁed automatically.
To illustrate our design, let us ﬁrst consider a toy game. Initially, a seller
sends her promotion information to a small number of players she is able to
reach, denoted by N and n = |N | who are called aware players. The information
is associated with a lottery such that one winner among aware players will be
uniformly and randomly selected to get a reward normalized to $1. When nobody
propagates the information, everyone’s expected reward is 1/n. For player i ∈ N ,
she has a set of friends Fi such that fi = |Fi| ≥ 1 and N ∩ Fi = ∅. If i signs
an agreement with Fi such that if anyone in Fi is selected to be the winner, the
reward is given i, then by propagating the information to Fi, player i’s reward,
which equals to the probability that the winner is selected from Fi ∪ {i}, is
1 + fi
n + fi

.

That is i can increase her reward by propagating the information to her friends,
and thus no propagation for N is not a Nash equilibrium. Actually, since In-
equality 1 holds for any n ≥ 2, everyone’s dominate strategy is to propagate the
formation to their friends. But to what extent will they propagate?

Assuming all players in N except i inform the information to their friends and
withhold the complete reward, let us see what i will do. If i does not withhold
the complete reward but shares a small amount, say 0 < c < 1, with Fi, i
can again improve her utility. For j ∈ Fi, let Fj be j’s friends who are not in
the game. Supposing all j ∈ Fj adopts the same strategy with N \ {i}, i.e.,
fully propagating the information to their friends and withholding the complete
reward c, we compare two cases for player i: (1) i does not leave any reward to
j, and (2) i leaves c to j. To ease the notation, suppose there are n(cid:48) players who
are in the game except j’s friends Fj for every j ∈ Fi. It is not hard to see that
for case (1), player i’s reward is (1 + fi)/n(cid:48) and for case (2), her reward is

as long as for all j ∈ Fi,

(cid:80)

j∈Fi

1 + (1 − c) · (cid:80)

→ 1 if c → 0.

Thus we conclude that withholding the complete reward from propagation is not
a Nash equilibrium, and every player wants to leave partial reward to her friends
for incentivizing them to further propagate the information.

We note that the initial n aware players are in the Prisoner’s dilemma. If
they do not propagate the information, each of them has expected utility of 1/n.
However, it is dominant for each of them to refer their friends by sacriﬁcing
partial reward, resulting the expected utility strictly smaller than 1/n. This
dilemma actually motivates the information propagation in the free market.

A more practical example for the above scenario is the mining game of Bit-
coin [23]. In Bitcoin, when a user makes a transaction (the information sender),
she wants the transaction to be broadcasted (with other necessary information
such as account information, transfer amount, crypto signature and etc) in the
network so that the miners can authorize the validity of the transaction and as-
semble newly veriﬁed transactions into blocks. The miners compete to propose
their blocks to the public chain by solving a computationally hard puzzle, and
the winning probability is proportional to the share of each miner’s computation
power in the system. Accordingly, the transaction maker can reward the winning
miner who authorizes her transaction a ﬁxed amount of Bitcoins. At ﬁrst glance,
it seems that the miners may not want to broadcast the transaction since only
the miners who know the transaction can be rewarded. A centralized reward-
ing scheme is proposed in [3] which not only rewards the winner but also other
miners who helped broadcast the transaction. By carefully designing who gets
much, their scheme is Sybil-proof in tree networks. However, as we will show in
this work, the design of free market with lotteries automatically incentivizes the
miners to propagate the transaction and satisﬁes all other desired properties as
well. Thus the take-home message of this work is that

the mechanism designer does not need to specify each player’s reward,
the market itself already provides incentives for maximal propagation.

1.1 Our Contribution

We model the problem, and the Bitcoin example, as an information propagation
game in a free market, where a sender has a single piece of information to
be broadcasted. For simplicity, we ﬁrst assume the players are connected by a
complete d-ary tree with d ≥ 3, and all players’ winning probabilities are the
same. If there is an edge between two players, they are friends and one can be
informed the information by the other. A strategy proﬁle is called full propagation
if every player withholds a minimum charge and leaves the remaining reward to
all her friends, so that a maximum number of people could be aware of the
information. We show that full propagation forms a Nash equilibrium which
satisﬁes extra properties and thus is more stable than an arbitrary one.

First, full propagation is robust to collective deviations of friends, i.e., con-
nected coalition-proof [4]. In the seminal work by Myerson [22], the communi-
cation game is proposed where the network on players represents the possible
communication between them. Originally, it is associated with cooperative games

4

J. Chen and B. Li.

and only coalitions formed by players who can communicate with each other (i.e.,
connected subgraphs in the network) are concerned. We adapt this principle to
our problem and show that any deviation of a connected coalition of players
from full propagation makes at least one of them worse oﬀ.

Second, full propagation survives in any order of iterative elimination of dom-
inated strategies, and uniquely survives in a particular one. This result coincides
with and generalizes the result of [3], where a centralized rewarding scheme is
designed. In a centralized rewarding scheme, a player can only misbehave by
withholding the information and claiming Sybil copies, while in a free market
a player can arbitrarily claim how much of the reward she wants to deduct be-
fore propagating to others. We formally discuss the diﬀerence between our work
and [3] at the end of Section 3. Recall that strategy s (weakly) dominating s(cid:48),
denoted by s (cid:22) s(cid:48), means choosing s always gives at least as good an outcome
as choosing s(cid:48), no matter what the other players do, and there is at least one
proﬁle of opponents’ actions for which s gives a strictly better outcome than s(cid:48).
We prove that full propagation is the unique strategy proﬁle that survives in
an interval-based monotone elimination of dominated strategies, coinciding with
the players’ reasoning process as illustrated in the introduction.

Our main results can be summarized as follows.

Main Result 1. (Theorems 1 and 2) In the tree-structured free market with lot-
teries, full propagation achieves maximal propagation and satisﬁes the following:

1. Full propagation is a Nash equilibrium;
2. Any deviation of a coalition of friends hurts at least one of them;
3. Full propagation survives in any order of iterative elimination of dominated

strategies;

4. There is an order of iterative elimination of dominated strategies such that

full propagation is the unique surviving strategy.

We then extend the above results to non-tree networks. For arbitrary net-
works, we introduce stronger relationships than friends, good friends and best
friends, using shortest paths from the information sender to players. Although
properties 3 and 4 in Main Result 1 do not hold, we show that if every player has
at least three good friends, full propagation is a Nash equilibrium that is also
connected coalition-proof on the induced good-friendship subgraph. It is noted
that d-ary tree with d ≥ 3 is a special case satisfying this condition.

Main Result 2. (Theorem 3) If every player has at least 3 good friends, then
full propagation is a Nash equilibrium that is connected coalition-proof on the
good-friendship subgraph.

In conclusion, if the network is well structured, the free market with lotteries
is incentive compatible where players are willing to fully propagate the infor-
mation. It is not hard to check that our scheme also satisﬁes other properties
mentioned in the introduction. It is strongly budget feasible and individual ra-
tional, as the full reward will be given to the players and none of them needs
to pay. Our scheme is also Sybil-proof, as in our game, the players are required

to provide certiﬁcates on how many people they have referred to. For example,
in Bitcoin each miner needs to contribute their computing power on authorizing
the transaction; and in sales promotion, only people who physically appear in
the market can be selected as the winner. Therefore, as everyone in our game can
arbitrarily decide how much reward she wants to get back from friends, making
Sybil identities is the same as withholding a higher fraction of the reward.

Finally, it is an interesting future direction to generalize our results to random
networks. We believe full propagation brings players high utility in a broader
class of networks. To shed more light in this direction, we conduct experiments
in Section 5 for our scheme under general random networks. In all experiments,
full propagation brings a player the maximum utility. Moreover, the utility gap
between full propagation and other strategies is actually large.

1.2 Related Works

Our work is partially motivated by the extensive study of incentivizing relays in
a blockchain network to propagate transactions. While this has been studied in
the literature, most of them focus on centralized algorithms where each relay’s
reward is ﬁxed and decided by the algorithm. With these algorithms, to gain
higher utility, a strategic relay may claim fake copies, i.e., Sybil attack [11].
Accordingly, in works such as [3,15], Sybil-proof algorithms are studied. Since
in our free market each relay is able to arbitrarily decide how much reward she
is willing to withhold, it is superﬂuous for them to make fake copies, and thus,
our results directly imply Sybil-proofness. The free market ideas have also been
discussed independently in [1] and [7] without a systematic analysis.

Our work also aligns with the fundamental study of what the optimal way
is to reward miners for their work on authorizing transactions. Currently, the
most popular rewarding scheme, as adopted by Bitcoin, is to reward miners
proportionally to their share of the total contributed computational power. As
shown in [9], the proportional allocation rule is the unique rule that is simulta-
neously non-negative, budget-balanced, symmetric, Sybil-proof, and collusion-
proof. In reality, however, to earn steady rewards, miners pool themselves to-
gether, and the pools are vulnerable to security attacks, such as selﬁsh mining
attack [16,18,20,10], block withholding attack [24,25], and denial of service at-
tack [17]. Cooperative games are used in [21] to show that under high transaction
loads, it is hard for managers to distribute rewards in a stable way.

Outside the scope of blockchain, information propagation has also been stud-
ied in multi-level marketing [13,12] and query incentive networks [19,2,6,5,8].
There are major diﬀerences between the transaction propagation in a blockchain
network and the query retrieval in peer-to-peer network. The players in a query
incentive network do not compete with the ones who forwarded the message
to them, and cannot generate an answer that they do not have. Whereas in a
blockchain network, every aware player is a potential authorizer with probability
proportional to their stakes or computational powers.

2 Game Theoretic Model and Preliminaries

For technical simplicity, we ﬁrst assume all players are connected by a tree
G = (V, E). Let s be the root of G who is the sender of the information. Note that
s is not a player in our game. Suppose s has f children and thus excluding s from
G, there are f subtrees denoted by {T1, · · · , Tf }. When there is no confusion, we
also use each Ti to denote the set of nodes in it. Assume all these subtrees are
complete d-ary and f ≥ d ≥ 3. Call N = V \ {s} the set of players and denote by
n = |N |. To make the players distinguishable from the sender, we stop calling s
the root and only call her sender. Instead, we call the roots of these subtrees roots
on depth 0, who are the initial players of the game, as shown in the following
ﬁgure. In a similar fashion, the children of these subtree roots are viewed to be
on depth 1 and so on. For each node i ∈ V , let N Bi be the set of her children
in G, and thus N Bs contains all initial players.

We next deﬁne the propagation game Γ = (N, S, u) on G. Without loss
of generality, we assume the initial reward set by the sender is 1. Denote by
Si the strategy space of each player i ∈ N . Let S = S1 × · · · × Sn be the
strategy proﬁles. Any strategy si ∈ Si is a mapping from R+ to (R+ ∪{⊥})|N Bi|,
where R+ = [0, +∞). That is, upon receiving the information with remaining
reward xi, player i decides how much reward si(xi)j to leave to her child j
by sending the information to j or not to inform j if si(xi)j = ⊥. Denote by
si(xi) = (si(xi)1, · · · , si(xi)|N Bi|). A feasible strategy is that for all j ∈ N Bi,
if xi ≥ xmin, 0 ≤ si(xi)j ≤ xi − xmin or si(xi)j = ⊥; otherwise, si(xi)j ≡ ⊥.
Here xmin > 0 is a suﬃciently small number preﬁxed by the system. Denote by
s = s1 × · · · × sn a strategy proﬁle. For any strategy proﬁle s ∈ S and an initial
reward, there is a ﬁxed set of players who can be informed the information,
called aware players and denoted by N ∗(s). When s is clear in the context,
we simply write N ∗. To avoid cumbersome calculations, all aware players will
1
get the reward with equal probability of
|N ∗| , and the winner needs to share the
reward with her ancestors from her to the sender as committed. Thus, a player i’s
(expected) utility consists of two parts: authorizing utility and referring utility,

where nij is the number of aware players following j and including j.

Next we formulate the intuition in Inequality 1 by the following lemma, which

shows it is always (strictly) better for a player to propagate the information.

Lemma 1. For any player i, let s−i be −i’s strategy proﬁle such that the re-
maining reward xi to i is at least xmin. Let si(xi) = (z1, · · · , zj, · · · , z|N Bi|) be
a strategy with zj = ⊥ for some j and s(cid:48)
j, · · · , z|N Bi|) be a new
strategy by changing j’s action from ⊥ to 0. Then ui(si, s−i) < ui(s(cid:48)

i(xi) = (z1, · · · , z(cid:48)

i, s−i).

We prove Lemma 1 in the appendix. By Lemma 1, every aware player does not
get hurt by propagating the information to all her neighbours, and thus in what
follows, we assume without loss of generality si(xi)j ≥ 0 for any xi ≥ xmin and
j ∈ N Bi. Moreover, in the following sections, we will see that the aware players
actually want to maximally propagate the information. A feasible strategy si
is called full propagation (FP for short) if si(xi)j = (k − 1)xmin for all j and
kxmin ≤ xi < (k + 1)xmin with k ≥ 1. That is in an FP strategy, a player wants
to inform all her neighbours by leaving the maximal reward to them. A feasible
strategy proﬁle s = (si)i∈N is called FP if every si is FP. Denote by s∗ = (s∗
i )i∈N
the FP strategy proﬁle.

3 Main Results

To ease formulas, we deﬁne the following notations. For each subtree T , let

G(k) =

k
(cid:88)

j=1

dj−1 =

dk − 1
d − 1

be the number of nodes from depth 0 to depth k − 1. Note that when d ≥ 3 and
k ≥ 1, G(k) ≥ 2k − 1. Moreover, for any k ≥ 1,

(f − 1)G(k + 1) ≥ dk+1 − 1 > d(dk − 1) ≥

d + 1
d − 1

(dk − 1)

= (d + 1)G(k) ≥ dG(k) + 2k − 1.

(2)

Denote by H · xmin = 1 the sender’s initial reward, where H > 1 is an integer.
Then H is the maximal depth that the information can reach. For any player i
in depth j ≥ 0, no matter what i’s previous players do, i is not able to receive
the information with remaining reward more than (H − j) · xmin since each of i’s
ancestors needs to withhold at least xmin. Moreover, all the users in and below
depth H are not considered as strategic players. Finally, under FP strategies,
the number of aware players is f · G(H + 1).

3.1 Technical Lemmas

We next introduce two technical lemmas which are crucial to prove the main
results. For a subtree T , let π0(T ) be the number of players outside of T who are
aware of the information. If T is clear from the context, we write π0 for short.

8

J. Chen and B. Li.

Lemma 2. Consider the sub-game induced on a single subtree T , where r is the
root player and g is one of r’s descendants. Assume r receives the information
with reward xr and k · xmin ≤ xr < (k + 1) · xmin for some k ≥ 1. If d ≥ 3 and
π0 ≥ d · G(k) + 2k − 1, r’s utility is maximized when g plays FP strategy, taking
the actions of the others as given.

Proof. Note that if xr < 2xmin or the information cannot reach g, r’s utility does
not depend on g’s action, thus the statement is trivially true. In the following
we assume xr ≥ 2xmin.

Taking the actions of the players (including r) except g as given, let ∆j be
the total number of r’s referred players from r’s child j and ∆ = (cid:80)
∆j.
Let g(cid:48) be g’s ancestor who is r’s direct child or g(cid:48) = g when g is r’s child. Thus g’s
strategy can only change ∆g(cid:48), which is the single variable of r’s utility. Formally,
r’s utility can be written as (assuming π0 includes r to simplify notions)

Claim 1 For d ≥ 3 and 0 ≤ yj < k, ¯fj(yj) = (k + 1 − yj) · dyj −1
increases with respect to yj.
To prove the above claim, it suﬃces to calculate the derivative of ¯fj(yj), and we
omit the details. By Claim 1, fj(yj) ≤ ¯fj(yj) ≤ G(k) for any 0 ≤ yj < k. Thus,

The last inequality is because π0 ≥ dG(k) + 2k − 1 and k ≥ 2.

In conclusion, if g receives the information with remaining reward at least
r(∆g(cid:48)) > 0, which means r’s utility is maximized when g plays FP strat-
(cid:117)(cid:116)

xmin, u(cid:48)
egy, which ﬁnishes the proof.

Lemma 2 implies that, if the information is known to a suﬃciently large num-
ber of players, for an arbitrary player, her utility is maximized when all her de-
scendants play FP strategies. Next we show that the other direction of Lemma 2
also holds: for an arbitrary player, if the information is aware to a suﬃciently
large number of players and all her descendants play FP strategies, her utility
is maximized when she plays FP strategy.

Fixing a tree T , let i be some player in depth j of T . Assume the remaining
reward i has received is kxmin ≤ xi < (k + 1)xmin for some 0 ≤ k ≤ H − j − 1,
and all her descendants play FP strategies. Given any strategy si(xi), deﬁne

s(cid:48)
i(xi) =

si(xi)1
xmin

(cid:99) · xmin, · · · , (cid:98)

si(xi)d

(cid:19)

(cid:99) · xmin

.

Note that given her descendants playing FP strategies, s(cid:48)
i(xi) brings i utility at
least as much as si(xi) does. The set of all possible s(cid:48)
i(xi) is called reasonable
strategies. Thus given all i’s descendants playing FP strategies, to study i’s best
response, it suﬃces to consider reasonable strategies. For convenience, we use
(d0, d1, · · · , dk) to represent a reasonable strategy, where dl ∈ [d] means i selects
dl children to propagate to next l depths by leaving (l − 1)xmin to these children,
and d0 means i selects d0 children to not propagate. Thus (cid:80)k
l=0 dl = d. Note
that it does not matter which dl children are selected since all i’s children are
symmetric. In the following, we use ui((d0, d1, · · · , dk); xi) to denote i’s utility
when she receives reward xi and her action is (d0, d1, · · · , dk), given all other
players adopting FP strategies.

Lemma 3. Consider the sub-game on a single subtree T , where r is the root
player. Assume r receives the information with reward xr and k · xmin ≤ xr <
(k + 1) · xmin for some k ≥ 1. If d ≥ 3, π0 ≥ d · G(k) + 2k − 1, and all r’s
descendants adopting FP strategies, for any reasonable strategy (d0, d1, · · · , dk),
r’s utility increases by moving a unit from 0 ≤ l < k to l + 1. Formally, if for
some 0 ≤ l < k such that dl > 0, then

ur((d0, · · · , dl, · · · , dk); xr) < ur((d0, · · · , dl − 1, dl+1 + 1, · · · , dk); xr).

Proof. To simplify our notions, we ignore the index r for the root player, and
let x be the propagation reward that the root receives. When kxmin ≤ x <
(k + 1)xmin and k ≥ 1, the root is able to leave a proper reward to the players
in depth 1 so that the information can be reached to at most depth k. When
it is convenient, we write x = (k + (cid:15))xmin and 0 ≤ (cid:15) < 1. Given any strategy
(d0, · · · , dk) such that (cid:80)k
j=0 dj = d and di > 0 for some 0 ≤ i < k, we compare
u((d0, · · · , dl, · · · , dk); x) and u((d0, · · · , dl − 1, dl+1 + 1, · · · , dk); x).

If l = 0, Lemma 3 degenerates to Lemma 1 restricted to trees, which is

trivially true. Thus in the following, we assume l ≥ 1.

If xmin ≤ x < 2xmin, the remaining reward a player in depth 1 receives is
always smaller than xmin; that is there is no way the information can reach depth
2. Let 1 < d0 ≤ d and d1 = d − d0. It is not hard to check that by notifying one
more player,

u((d0, d1); x) =

(cid:117)(cid:116)

Lemma 3 is essentially a generalization of Lemma 1 to tree structures, which
means if the information is already known to a suﬃciently large number of
players, it is always beneﬁcial for a player to make the information reach players
in one deeper level. By induction, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 1. Consider the sub-game on a single subtree T , where r is the root
player. Assume r receives the information with reward xr and k · xmin ≤ xr <
(k+1)·xmin for some k ≥ 1. If d ≥ 3, π0 ≥ dG(k)+2k−1, and all r’s descendants
adopt FP strategies, r’s (unique) best strategy is ((k −1)·xmin, · · · , (k −1)·xmin).

Note that Lemmas 2, 3 and Corollary 1 do not only hold for the root players,

but also for any player in a subtree T .

3.2 Main Results

Given Lemma 2 and Corollary 1, it is not hard to verify that FP strategy proﬁle
s∗ is a Nash equilibrium, as for each ﬁxed tree, the information is known to the
other f − 1 trees, and thus the number of aware players is at least

(f − 1)G(H + 1) ≥ (d − 1)G(H + 1) ≥ (d + 1)G(H).

12

J. Chen and B. Li.

However, s∗ is not the unique Nash equilibrium. Consider the following strategy
proﬁle. Denote by 0 the root player of an arbitrary subtree T and by 1, · · · , d
her children. Consider the strategy proﬁle s(cid:48): for all x ≥ xmin, s0(x) = (0, · · · , 0)
and si(x) = (⊥, · · · , ⊥) for all i ∈ {1, · · · , d}; all the other players in T and
all players not in T play arbitrary strategies. That is by notifying the players
in depth 1, the root 0 withholds the complete reward no matter how much the
initial reward is, and the players in depth 1 do not propagate the information at
all no matter how much reward the root player leaves for them. Next, we claim
strategy proﬁle s(cid:48) is a Nash equilibrium and for simplicity, we assume d ≥ 4.
First, for each player not in tree T , as there are at least f − 2 other trees play
FP, π0 ≥ (f − 2)G(H + 1) > dG(k) + 2k − 1 for any k ≥ 0. By Corollary 1,
the best response of them is FP, thus all these players will not deviate. Second,
the root player 0 does not deviate, as all her children do not propagate the
information and her best strategy is to withhold all the reward; Finally, no
player in {1, · · · , d} deviates, as the remaining reward for the information is 0.
We can observe that in s(cid:48), all {0, 1, · · · , d} played “bad” strategies. By deviating
to FP strategies simultaneously, all of them can improve their utilities, which
means s∗ is more stable equilibrium than s(cid:48).

We next deﬁne connected coalition-proof Nash equilibria on graphs, which are
stronger than an arbitrary Nash equilibrium. Let Γ = (N, S, u) be any game with
n players, and for any C ⊆ N , denote SC = ×i∈CSi. Let G = (N, E) be a graph
deﬁned on players with (i, j) ∈ E meaning players i and j can communicate with
each other directly. A Nash equilibrium s ∈ S is called connected coalition-proof
on G if there is no coalition C ⊆ N with the induced subgraph of C on G being
C, ui(s(cid:48)
connected such that by deviating to s(cid:48)
C, sN \C) ≥ ui(s) for any i ∈ C
and there is one j ∈ C such that uj(s(cid:48)
C, sN \C) > uj(s). It is easy to see that
any strong Nash equilibrium is connected coalition-proof on a complete graph
and any Nash equilibrium is connected coalition-proof on an empty graph. As
pointed out by Myerson in [22], the requirement of connected coalition-proof is
practical as the players in any deviating coalition should be able to communicate.

Theorem 1. For f ≥ d ≥ 3, full propagation strategy proﬁle s∗ is a connected
coalition-proof Nash equilibrium on G.

Proof. For any coalition C ⊆ N , denote by G(C) the induced subgraph of C in
G. We ﬁrst observe that G(C) being connected implies G(C) being a subtree in
some T . Then to prove the theorem, it suﬃces to show for any deviation s(cid:48)
C from
s∗
C, there is at least one player whose utility is smaller than the case when all of
them play FP. Let r be the root of G(C). Without loss of generality, we reorder
the players in C \ {r} by {1, 2, · · · , c} where c = |C \ {r}|.

Given the other players not in T play FP strategies, the information will be

known to at least π0 players, and when d ≥ 3, by Equation 2,

π0 ≥ (f − 1)G(H + 1) > dG(H) + 2H − 1.

If r is in depth H − 1, all players in C \ {r} are dummy, whose actions do not
C will strictly decreases

aﬀect r’s utility. Thus by Lemma 1, any deviation from s∗
r’s utility. In the following, we assume r is above depth H − 1.

Maximal Information Propagation via Lotteries

Since π0 ≥ dG(H) + 2H − 1, by Lemma 2,

ur(s(cid:48)

C, s∗

N \C) ≤ ur(s(cid:48)

C\{1}, s∗

{1}∪(N \C)).

That is by changing player 1’s strategy to FP, r’s utility can only increase. We
continue this procedure for player i = 2, · · · , c by changing her strategy from si
to s∗

i , and we have

ur(s(cid:48)

{r,i,··· ,c}, s∗

{1,··· ,i−1}∪N \C) ≤ ur(s(cid:48)

{r,i+1,··· ,c}, s∗

{1,··· ,i}∪N \C).

Eventually, we obtain

ur(s(cid:48)

C, s∗

N \C) ≤ ur(s(cid:48)

r, s∗

N \{r}).

By Corollary 1, when all i’s descendants play FP strategies,

ur(s(cid:48)

r, s∗

N \{r}) < ur(s∗).

Thus, ur(s(cid:48)

C, s∗

N \C) < ur(s∗), which ﬁnishes the proof.

(cid:117)(cid:116)

By Theorem 1, we have shown that s∗ is more stable than an ordinary Nash
equilibrium. But s∗ is not a strong Nash equilibrium, because all the f root
players can form a deviating coalition such that none of them propagates the
information, which brings each root player utility 1
f . However, as we have seen
in the introduction, no propagation of these f players is not an equilibrium.

Next we show that s∗ survives in any possible order of elimination of dom-
inated strategies, and uniquely survives in an almost monotonic order of elim-
ination of dominated strategies, which surpasses the result in [3]. We call an
elimination order monotonic if for any player i and any two eliminated strate-
i, minj si(x∗

s(cid:48)

i )j < minj s(cid:48)

i )j∗ < s(cid:48)

i(x∗

Theorem 2. For f > d ≥ 3, s∗ survives in any possible order of elimination
of dominated strategies. Moreover, s∗ is the unique Nash equilibrium survives in
an almost monotonic order of elimination of dominated strategies.

Theorem 2 is proved in the appendix. Note that all our results in this section
hold as long as each player has at least d children, where d ≥ 3. Actually, similar
results also hold for the case of d = 1, 2, but the players may withhold multiples
of xmin.

Remark. Theorem 2 is similar to the result in [3]. They designed a hybrid reward-
ing scheme, which combines two nearly-uniform algorithms, that is Sybil-proof.
Each player in a nearly-uniform algorithm A nearly-uniform algorithm speciﬁes
a maximal length H of rewarding path and rewards winning player in a chain
of length h a reward of 1 + β · (H − h + 1). All the players between the sender

and the winner are rewarded β. Though β plays a similar role with our xmin,
there are several diﬀerences. One of the main diﬀerences is that, by the design of
the free market, the players can arbitrarily decide her own charge as long as the
charge is at least of xmin, which is not restricted to be integer multiples of xmin
(i.e., Sybil copies). A second diﬀerence is that we do not combine two diﬀerent
schemes. The advantage of the free market design is that the system does not
need to (carefully) specify who gets how much, and the players themselves are
already motivated to maximally propagate the information, which is also the
main take-home message of the current paper.

4 A Class of Non-tree Networks

In this section, we investigate the extent to which our results for trees can be
extended to general networks. In a non-tree network, a player may get the in-
formation from multiple neighbours and she will claim the one who leaves the
highest reward to her, where tie is broken arbitrarily but consistently. Again let
G = (V, E) be an arbitrary network and s ∈ V be the initial sender. We ﬁrst
introduce the notions of good friends and best friends. For two players i and j, i
is j’s best friend if (1) i and j are connected, and (2) every shortest path from
sender s to j passes i. If i is j’s best friend, then j is called i’s good friend. Note
that each player can have at most one best friend but multiple good friends. For
example, in Fig 2(a), a, b, and d are the best friends of c, e, and g, respectively.
However, d and f do not have any best friend as each of them has two disjoint
shortest paths to s. Let T = (V, E(cid:48)) be the subgraph of G, where E(cid:48) ⊆ E and
(i, j) ∈ E(cid:48) if i is j’s good or best friend. Note that T is a spanning forest of G,
and the root of each tree is either s or a player who does not have best friend.
As an example, the solid lines in Fig 2(a) form a good-friendship graph.

(a) Good-Friendship Graph T .

(b) Information Propagation Tree T ∗.

Fig. 2. Illustration of Good-Friendship Graph and Information Propagation Tree.

Next we prove that if every player has at least three good friends, then
full propagation is a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, this equilibrium is robust to

sacfgebdsacfgebdMaximal Information Propagation via Lotteries

15

collective deviations of good friends. Note that the case of d-ary tree with d ≥ 3
in Section 3 is a special case of this situation where G = T .

Theorem 3. If every player has at least 3 good friends, then FP strategies s∗
is a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, it is connected coalition-proof on T .

Proof. If every player has at least 3 good friends, then every node in T has
at least 3 children in its corresponding tree. Let T ∗ be the corresponding in-
formation propagation tree under s∗, where i is connected to j if j claims i as
the ancestor. Essentially, T ∗ connects all the trees in T as shown in Fig 2(b).
We ﬁrst prove s∗ is a Nash equilibrium. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction,
some player i wants to deviate from s∗. We partition i’s neighbours into two
sets S1 and S2, where S1 contains the players whose distance to s is at most
i’s distance to s, and S2 contains the players whose distance to s is longer than
i’s distance to s. Note that player i’s action does not aﬀect players in S1 and
their descendants in T ∗. We further partition S2 into S21 and S22, where S21
contains all i’s good friends and S22 = S2 \ S21. If i does not fully propagate
to players in S22, i loses all the referring utility from S22 because they can still
be informed via other paths, which decreases i’s utility. By the condition of the
lemma, |S21| ≥ 3, and only players in S21 are connected with i in T . Moreover,
under s∗, i will be claimed as the ancestor with higher priority by all her descen-
dants in T . Then our problem degenerates to the case of trees in the previous
section, and by Lemma 3, i’s utility is maximized by FP, which means s∗ is a
Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the reason why s∗ is connected coalition-proof on
T is in the same with Theorem 1: Any connected subgraph in T forms a subtree
with a root player i, whose utility decreases by deviating from s∗.
(cid:117)(cid:116)

Here we note that s∗ may not be connected coalition-proof on the original
network G. To see this, if all senders’ direct neighbours are connected with each
other, they can form a connected coalition and do not propagate the information
to others, which brings each of them higher utility than full propagation.

5 Experiments

Finally, we conduct experiments to conﬁrm the validity of the free market design
in random networks. We ﬁrst introduce the parameters in our experiments. Given
a parameter d, there are n players and each player is randomly connected to d
2
other players, so that the expected degree of each player is d. We study the utility
of a ﬁxed player and the sender is randomly selected from the other players. Fix
all other players’ strategies to be full propagation. Set the initial reward to 1
and xmin = 1
H . In each experiment, we randomly generate K networks. For
simplicity, we only consider the strategies that withhold integral multiples of
xmin, and calculate the expected utility of the studied player for each strategy.
In Fig 3, we set n = 1000 and H = 6. For each d = 6/10/14, we randomly
construct K = 100 networks. We observe that full propagation (by withholding
xmin) brings a signiﬁcantly higher utility on average than the other strategies

16

J. Chen and B. Li.

Fig. 3. When all players have the same expected degree.

(by withholding kxmin for k > 1). Then we revise the experiments by making the
studied player more powerful or less powerful than the others, where a powerful
player has higher degree than the others and a powerless player has lower degree
than the others. In Fig 4, the degree for the powerful player is set to 2d and for
the powerless player it is set to be d
2 . Similarly, we observe that in both cases,
full propagation brings signiﬁcantly higher utility than the other strategies.

Fig. 4. When the player is powerful or powerless.

Note that full propagation is not always optimal. If a player i exclusively
controls some players (i.e., the sender’s information can only be reached to them
via i) and these players form a complete graph, the optimal local strategy for
i is to leave 0 to all of them instead of full propagation. Thus, if the network

Maximal Information Propagation via Lotteries

17

structure is known to players, the players can compute their optimal propagating
strategies, which may not be full propagation. However, such “bad” networks
barely happen in random networks and never happen in reality. To further avoid
security threats, such as in a blockchain protocol, the players can be randomly
re-connected periodically so that it is not beneﬁcial for players to spend eﬀort
on learning network structures any more.

6 Conclusion and Future Directions

In this work, we design a free market with lotteries to incentivize players to
maximally propagate information to their friends. For trees and a large class of
non-tree networks, we prove that full propagation is robust against connected
coalitions of players. Particularly, full propagation in tree networks uniquely sur-
vives in an interval-based monotone iterative elimination of dominated strategies.
For future directions, from a theoretical perspective, it is intriguing to analyze
players’ behaviours in the free market within arbitrary or random networks and
consider non-uniform lotteries. For example, if the property of every node hav-
ing 3 good friends holds for certain random graphs, then Theorem 3 holds for
such graphs as well. In addition, in the current market only the ﬁnal winner
and the players on the propagation path reaching her get rewarded. It would be
interesting to see if there is a way to select and reward more than one winners
and corresponding propagation paths. In a blockchain, this could correspond to
multiple block proposers whose blocks are not eventually ﬁnalized, and may help
reducing the players’ risk, so as to encourage more to participate in a risk-avert
model. Moreover, it is interesting and challenging to design new reward schemes
to incentivize information propagation in more complex networks. Finally, from
a practical perspective, experiments on synthetic and real-world data for com-
plex networks may reveal important insights on the behavior of a free market in
such networks, further enabling market design for them.

Appendix

A Missing Proofs

A.1 Proof of Lemma 1

Lemma 1 (restated). For any player i, let s−i be −i’s strategy proﬁle such that
the remaining reward xi to i is at least xmin. Let si(xi) = (z1, · · · , zj, · · · , z|N Bi|)
be a strategy with zj = ⊥ for some j and s(cid:48)
j, · · · , z|N Bi|) be a
new strategy by changing j’s action from ⊥ to 0. Then ui(si, s−i) < ui(s(cid:48)
i, s−i).

i(xi) = (z1, · · · , z(cid:48)

Proof. We ﬁrst consider player i’s utility under strategy proﬁle (si, s−i). For
l ∈ [|N Bi|], let ∆l ≥ 0 be the number of players i successfully refers through

18

J. Chen and B. Li.

neighbour l and π0 be the total number of players who are aware of the infor-
mation. Then i’s utility is

ui(si, s−i) =

xi + (cid:80)

zl(cid:54)=⊥(xi − zl)∆l

π0

.

Now consider i’s utility under strategy proﬁle (s(cid:48)

i, s−i). By changing zj = ⊥
to zj = 0, j may or may not claim i as her ancestor. If not, it means that j
is already aware of the information, but someone else leaves a higher utility for
her, thus i’s utility does not change, i.e., ui(s(cid:48)

i, s−i) = ui(si, s−i).

If j claims i as her ancestor, there are two cases: (1) j is already aware of the
information, but i is on the shortest path or the tie breaking rule is in favour
of j, thus s(cid:48)
i does not increase π0; (2) j is not aware of the information, thus s(cid:48)
i
increase π0 by 1. In any case, i’s utility is at least

ui(s(cid:48)

i, s−i) =

2xi + (cid:80)

zl(cid:54)=⊥(xi − zl)∆l

To show ui(s(cid:48)

(z1, · · · , zd). If xi < xmin, it is not possible for i to propagate the informa-
tion, and the unique action is si(xi) = (⊥, · · · , ⊥), thus we assume xi ≥ xmin. In
the following, we explicitly give the elimination order of dominated strategies.

Let π0 be the number of players who are aware of the information. As all

root players know the information, by default, π0 ≥ d + 1.

Round 1. For any xi ≥ xmin,

si(xi) = (z1, · · · , 0 < zj < xmin, · · · , zd) (cid:22) s(cid:48)

i(xi) = (z1, · · · , 0, · · · , zd).

Note that leaving less than xmin to j, j is not able to propagate the informa-
tion. That is for any s−i, under both strategy proﬁles (si, s−i) and (s(cid:48)
i, s−i), the
numbers of aware players are the same. As s(cid:48)
i potentially brings higher refer-
ring utility, ui(si, s−i) ≤ ui(s(cid:48)
i, s−i). Particularly, if s−i is the one that i receives
exactly xi from her parent4, ui(si, s−i) < ui(s(cid:48)
i(xi). Elim-
inate all such dominated strategies for all players.

i, s−i). Thus si(xi) (cid:22) s(cid:48)

4 If i is in depth 0, we consider xi as the initial reward from the sender.

If xmin ≤ xi < 2xmin, as 0 ≤ zj ≤ xi −xmin < xmin for all j, for any remaining
strategy si, si(xi) = (0, · · · , 0). That is when the remaining reward to a player
is less than 2xmin, she will fully propagate the information.

As all root players are aware of the information and all of them will notify
the players in depth 1, after this round, for all possible strategy proﬁles, π0 ≥
f G(2) ≥ (d + 1)G(2).

Round 2. First, for any xi ≥ 2xmin,

si(xi) = (z1, · · · , zj = 0, · · · , zd) (cid:22) s(cid:48)

i(xi) = (z1, · · · , xmin, · · · , zd).

This is because after the ﬁrst round, all players who receives xmin will propagate
the information to the next level, i.e. full propagation. By Corollary 1 and the
fact that π0 ≥ (d + 1)G(2) > G(2) + 3, si(xi) (cid:22) s(cid:48)
i(xi). Eliminate all such
dominated strategies for all players.

By induction, we have the following.

Round l > 2. First, for any xi ≥ lxmin and g ∈ {0, 1, · · · , l − 2},

si(xi) = (z1, · · · , zj = gxmin, · · · , zd) (cid:22) s(cid:48)

i(xi) = (z1, · · · , (l − 1)xmin, · · · , zd).

To see why, note that after the ﬁrst l − 1 rounds, π0 ≥ f G(l) ≥ (d + 1)G(l) >
dG(l)+2l−1 and if j receives (l−1)xmin, she and her descendants fully propagate
the information. By Corollary 1, si(xi) (cid:22) s(cid:48)
i(xi). Eliminate all such dominated
strategies for all players.

Second, for any xi ≥ lxmin,

si(xi) = (z1, · · · , zj, · · · , zd) (cid:22) s(cid:48)

i(xi) = (z1, · · · , (l − 1)xmin, · · · , zd),

where (l − 1)xmin < zj < lxmin. This is because after round l − 1, if (l −
1)xmin ≤ zj < lxmin, by induction, child j’s only possible action is sj(zj) =
((l − 2)xmin, · · · , (l − 2)xmin). Then leaving zj to child j, j will not notify more
nodes than leaving (l − 1)xmin to him. That is for any s−i, under both strategy
proﬁles (si, s−i) and (s(cid:48)
i, s−i), the numbers of aware players are the same. As
s(cid:48)
i potentially brings higher referring utility, ui(si, s−i) ≤ ui(s(cid:48)
i, s−i). Moreover,
if s−i is the one such that i receives exactly xi from her parent, ui(si, s−i) <
ui(s(cid:48)
i(xi). Eliminate all such dominated strategies for all
players.

i, s−i). Thus si(xi) (cid:22) s(cid:48)

Note that if lxmin ≤ xi < (l + 1)xmin, as 0 ≤ zj ≤ xi − xmin < lxmin
for any j, for any remaining strategy si after the ﬁrst l rounds, si(xi) = ((l −
1)xmin, · · · , (l − 1)xmin). Combining with previous rounds, when the remaining
reward to a player is less than (l+1)xmin, she will fully propagate the information.
Moreover, after this round, all the players in depth l + 1 are also aware of

the information, π0 ≥ f G(l + 1) ≥ (d + 1)G(l + 1) ≥ dG(l + 1) + 2(l + 1) − 1.

From above analysis, we observe that for kxmin ≤ xi < (k + 1)xmin, the
only remaining strategy is si(xi) = ((k − 1)xmin, · · · , (k + −1)xmin), i.e., full
propagation. Moreover, the elimination order of dominated strategies is almost
(cid:117)(cid:116)
monotonic.
