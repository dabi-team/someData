ABSTRACT
Since the birth of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrencies have emerged
to become a global phenomenon and an important decentralized
financial asset. Due to this decentralization, the value of these dig-
ital currencies against fiat currencies is highly volatile over time.
Therefore, forecasting the crypto-fiat currency exchange rate is
an extremely challenging task. For reliable forecasting, this paper
proposes a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble approach that
employs all modalities which derive price fluctuation such as social
media sentiments, search volumes, blockchain information, and
trading data. To better support investment decision making, the
approach forecasts also the fluctuation distribution. The conducted
extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of relying on
multimodalities instead of only trading data. Further experiments
demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed approach com-
pared to existing tools and methods with a 19.29% improvement.

1 INTRODUCTION
Since the first Bitcoin was mined in 2009, cryptocurrencies have
changed the concept of financial assets, where most of the promi-
nent ones are measured to have a combined value of almost $1
trillion in terms of market capitalization by January 2022 1. The
global cryptocurrency market grows at a compound annual growth
rate (CAGR) of 30% from 2019 to 20262. This growth represents
a profitable investment and trading opportunity which in return
affects the growth of the cryptocurrency market yielding a virtuous
circle. Unlike FIAT currencies which are controlled by central au-
thorities and banks, cryptocurrencies are completely decentralized
and their transactions are validated and processed through a cryp-
tographical network of nodes and recorded in a digital ledger of
transactions (i.e. Blockchain) [7]. All these characteristics and oth-
ers make the forecasting of the fiat-crypto currency exchange rate

(or simply cryptocurrency price forecasting) extremely challenging
and often inaccurate [2]. Therefore, financial and AI experts are
constantly analysing the market to better understand the trends of
price fluctuations [1, 2, 5, 6, 13, 16, 17].

Most of the recent studies on forecasting the price of cryptocur-
rencies [17, 19, 23, 25, 32] employed neural networks due to their
remarkable performance on similar tasks. Consequently, these ap-
proaches could achieve better results than traditional machine learn-
ing and statistical approaches [17, 31]. However, most of the existing
approaches consider only a few factors that influence the cryp-
tocurrency market. The problem is usually formalized as inferring a
forecast function based on the available training sets and then eval-
uating the obtained functions by how well it generalizes assuming
that price series often exhibit a homogeneous nonstationary [25].
In reality, unlike foreign exchange rates, many factors contribute
to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, such as the hash rate
of the cryptocurrency mining process and public awareness[16].
For instance, it has been found that the price of cryptocurrencies
is sensitive to public opinion sentiments [1, 18]. Yang, et al[31]
assume that social media sentiment is an important indicator of
future bitcoin price volatility.

To improve the forecasting results, this paper proposes to exploit
all accessible factors influencing cryptocurrency prices. Specifically,
we propose, for better investment decision-making, an ensemble of
multimodal cryptocurrency price prediction LSTM models that em-
ploy the trading data, sentiments from social media, the blockchain
data (i.e. hash rate, network difficulty, etc.) and search volumes
from search engines. The cryptocurrency use case is Bitcoin (B)
because of its significant market domination and popularity among
the other 7812 existing cryptocurrencies and because of the ex-
tensive data availability needed in this research. In summary, we
aim to support the investor decision making process with reliable
forecasting of price and fluctuation distribution by answering the
following research questions:

• RQ1: Which of the data modality combinations has a direct

impact on the cryptocurrency price?

• RQ2: Is ensemble learning on multimodal data effective in cryp-

tocurrency price forecasting?

• RQ3: How to interpret price forecasting with fluctuation distri-

bution?

To this end, the main contributions of this paper can be summa-

rized as follows:

• We exploit all accessible factors that drive the cryptocurrency
market, such as trading data, social media sentiments, blockchain
data, and search volumes.

 
 
 
 
 
 
• The proposed approach outperforms existing models and provide
reliable help for decision-making to investors by proposing an
AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble-learning architecture.

• In addition to the predicted price, our model outputs a fluctuation
distribution to help the investor understand the certainty of the
model’s forecasting.

• We conducted extensive experiments and analyses to validate

the effectiveness of the approach.

• For further improvements, we provide an open-source implemen-

tation.
Following this section, Section 2 provides an overview of the
existing related works. Section 3 presents the proposed approach
and the model’s proposed architecture. Next, all experiments details
and results are provided in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes
this paper and discusses possible future work improvements.

2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the related works divided into three
categories:

2.1 Traditional Market Price Forecasting
The task of forecasting stock price has been addressed for decades
by scholars in finance, statistics [9] and data science in order to
support investors in maximizing their profits and minimizing their
losses. One of the earliest solutions is adopting a statistical model.
Haviluddin et al. [4] conducted an in-depth comparison between sta-
tistical and machine learning techniques in near future forecasting
from time-series data. The comparison mainly covers the statistical
method ARIMA, Neural Networks, and genetic algorithms. The
obtained results show that Neural Networks are more efficient and
reliable in forecasting short-term time series.

In the last decade, with all the improvements that deep neural
networks proved on different applications, they became a primary
focus for financial and economic forecasting and time-series pre-
dictions [10, 14, 24, 27]. Deep learning approaches demonstrated
their capability to significantly outperform other methods due to
their ability to learn hidden features of time-series and historical
market trends. Traditional markets have relatively well-known fac-
tors and rules that directly influence the price trends, including the
number of asks, bids, the number of transactions, and more. This
makes it easier for a deep learning model to learn the patterns from
historical data and have a much more reliable forecasting, which is
reflected in the high accuracy and low error of the forecasting by
just applying prices, asks, and bids time series [24, 27].

Several studies tried to apply the same state-of-the-art deep
learning approaches used in traditional markets to forecast cryp-
tocurrency prices[20]. However, their results were not satisfactory
due to the different characteristics of the cryptocurrency market.

2.2 Machine Learning for Cryptocurrency

Price Forecasting

Due to the specific characteristics and high volatility of the cryp-
tocurrency market, specific approaches have been proposed to
forecast their prices. Yiying and Yaze [32] proposed various LSTM
and classical ANN architectures that take the price, ask, and bids
time series as input to forecast long and short-term price, focusing

Boukhers, et al.

on the price non-stationary dynamics of three cryptocurrencies
(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple). The obtained results demonstrate that
applying the correct ANN architecture can learn long-term pat-
terns, while LSTM tends to rely more on the short-term dynamics
of time series.

Similarly, McNally, et al. [21] compared two deep learning mod-
els, namely Bayesian-optimized Recurrent Neural Network and an
LSTM on long and short-term Bitcoin price forecasting. Both models
are fed with trading data (prices, asks, bids, and the number of trans-
actions) to outputs a binary price trend classification (price goes
up or down). In their results, LSTMs achieved a higher accuracy of
52% that marginally outperforms the Bayesian-optimized Recurrent
Neural Network and the classical statistical method ARIMA. How-
ever, the results are still cannot still be helpful for the investors due
to the high volatility and variance of cryptocurrency time series
over time, which make the line between overfitting and underfitting
very fine [21].

Kumar and Rath [17] also proposed to use only historical trading
data to forecast the trends of Ethereum prices using machine learn-
ing and deep learning models. The conducted experiments showed
that LSTM marginally outperforms the MLP in short-term predic-
tions. Pintelas et al. [25] conducted extensive experiments using
LSTM-based and CNN -based models and their analysis conducted
that both models follow an almost random walk process. To over-
come this, they suggest that new approaches and new validation
metrics should be explored to capture the hidden patterns.

Recently, Chevallier et al. [6] proposed a novel approach for cryp-
tocurrency forecasting that improved the performance significantly
while keeping the approach simple, which is an AdaBoost that uses
multiple decision trees weak learners. Surprisingly, the results have
demonstrated that AdaBoost outperforms all ANNs, LSTMs, KNN,
and SVMs by an average RMSE of $23.42 per 1 Bitcoin. In addition
to the promising results, the simplicity of the approach allows for
more generalizability and good interpretability of the outcome.

2.3 Sentiment Analysis for Cryptocurrency

Price Forecasting

Given the fact that the cryptocurrency market is influenced by
more factors than traditional markets, Krisoufek [16] studied the
price fluctuations to determine the driving factors of the prices
for multiple cryptocurrencies. Consequently, it has been found
that the cryptocurrencies market is affected by multiple factors,
mainly: the correlation between the number of asks, bids to the
rate exchange, The hash rate and other blockchain information and
public awareness. According to Krisoufek [16] , all these factors
contribute equally to the price fluctuations, but public awareness
has proven a much stronger correlation. Due to the complexity
of capturing public awareness, people sentiments can be a good
alternative. These sentiments are supposed to partially influence the
cryptocurrency price trend, especially sudden short-term changes.
For instance, In 2021, when news, social media influencers, and
governments were promoting against cryptocurrencies due to the
hashing consumption of electricity and the harm that is caused to
the environment [26], Bitcoin prices experienced a 41% drop in just
15 days. The negative sentiment generated for such announcements

Ensemble and Multimodal Approach for Forecasting Cryptocurrency Price

resulted in much fear within the market and, therefore, a further
collapse of the prices.

Young, et al. [15] has first introduced the hypothesis that cryp-
tocurrency forums’ sentiments influence Bitcoin prices. To validate
this hypothesis, they proposed a model that is fed with the senti-
ment data only. Using the VADER sentiment analysis tool, the study
analyzes user comments from the three most popular cryptocur-
rency forums that are first tagged with a sentiment score from 0
being very negative and 1 being very positive. The experimental
results validated the existence of a correlation between the price
trends and sentiments on the most popular cryptocurrency forums,
suggesting that fluctuations within the forum’s sentiments are an
early indication of near-future price fluctuations.

Inspired by these findings, several approaches [2, 11, 23] pro-
posed to employ sentiment analysis along with LSTM models to
predict the prices on the next trading day. Commonly, social media
and forum posts that contain keywords related to cryptocurrencies
(Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple) are first crawled. Subsequently,
each post is assigned a score from 0 to 1 depending on its sentiment
using the VADER tool. Next, all the sentiment scores are com-
bined with the prices, asks, and bids time series into a single vector
which serves as input to the LSTM architecture. The experiments
of these approaches demonstrated that applying sentiment analysis
marginally improves the forecasting results over other previous
deep learning models that rely purely on trading data. For a better
understanding of these improvements, Huang, et al. [11] compared
their approach and an autoregressive that use only trading data
on binary forecasting of cryptocurrency prices. The experiments
demonstrated that embedding sentiments into the input increase
the accuracy by 18.5% and the recall by 18.5% compared to the
autoregressive model. However, despite these improvements being
non-negligible, they are not enough to achieve reliable results that
can be used and helpful for financial decision-making, as concluded
by the study.

The main limitation of these previously mentioned studies [2,
6, 11, 17, 23, 25] is that all tweets and posts are equally treated
without considering the level of interactions (likes, comments, and
shares) that can significantly influence the impact of a particular
post on the overall sentiments. Another limitation is the focus on
only online communities and social media posts as a fluctuation
factor despite the fact that other factors are proven to be as crucial
as sentiments to the fluctuation changes [16].

3 APPROACH
Inspired by the work of Chevallier et al. [6] and Sun et al. [29], this
paper proposes to forecast cryptocurrency price in the next day
using taking advantage of all indicating factors (RQ1). To tackle
RQ2, we propose an ensemble learning approach that adopts adap-
tive boosting and LSTM architectures. This is because LSTMs are
known for their capability to learn hidden features and trends
within sequential data, especially for short-term goals [25]. Figure 1
illustrates an overview of our system, which consists of multiple
LSTM weak learners (i.e. forecasters) that together combine a cryp-
tocurrency price forecasting model. Each of these LSTM models in
trained on a sampled dataset from the original one, and then gets

ture for Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

assigned a weighted score according to its performance to be used
in the inference phase. Here, all LSTM outputs are multiplied with
their weights and divided by the total number of LSTM models
to calculate the predicted final price. Specifically, our system goes
through six main steps:
(1) Initialize the sampling weights 𝑠𝑁
such that 𝑠𝑖 = 1
𝑁 .

𝑖=1 for the 𝑁 training samples,

(2) The LSTM forecaster 𝑀𝑗 is trained on the training samples

sampled using the sampling weights 𝑠𝑁

(3) Calculate the errors 𝑒 ( 𝑗)
(4) Calculate the forecaster’s weight 𝑤 𝑗 as follows:

𝑤 𝑗 =

.

(2)

(6) Go to (1) and repeat the steps until all the LSTM forecasters are

trained.
Once, all the LSTM forecasters are trained, we can compute
the final price prediction ˆ𝑦 (𝑓 )
at time 𝑡 by combining the LSTMs’
outputs with their weights to obtain a final prediction as follows:

𝑡

ˆ𝑦 (𝑓 )

where 𝐽 denotes the total number of LSTM forecasters, ˆ𝑦 ( 𝑗)
denotes
the price prediction of the LSTM model 𝑗, and 𝑤 𝑗 denotes the weight
of the 𝑗th LSTM forecaster.

𝑡

Each of the LSTM forecasters outputs a price forecast of 1 Bitcoin
(B) for the next day (𝑡 + 1) in US dollars ($). For this, the forecaster
is fed with features of the last seven days {x}𝑡
𝑡 −7, where x𝑡 is
the normalized feature vector of length 18 for the date 𝑡, and is
the concatenation of four feature representations denoting four

modalities, namely trading data, sentiments, blockchain data and
search volumes. In the following, we discuss the modalities:

3.1 Input modalities
Although there exists a lot of cryptocurrencies, B is the most domi-
nant one and its related data is easily accessible. Therefore, Bitcoin
is the cryptocurrency use case considered in this paper, where we
collected data from 2012 until the end of 2020, consisting of:

3.1.1 Trading data: Trading data is a sequential set of attributes
that characterize the Bitcoin market. A time stamp 𝑡 represents a
single day where the open price is at 00:00 and the close price is at
23:59. At each 𝑡, the market is characterized with:
• Open ($): the price of one B at the start of 𝑡.
• High ($): the highest price of one B within 𝑡.
• Low ($): the lowest price of one B within 𝑡.
• Close ($): the price of one B at the end of 𝑡.
• Volume (B): the volume of B transacted during the interval

of 𝑡.

• Volume ($): the volume of B transacted during the time win-

dow of 𝑡.

• Weighted ($): the ratio of the value of B traded during the

time window of 𝑡.

• Average ($): the average fees charged for transactions in the

top 20 trading and exchange platforms and services.

• Transactions: the total number of transactions performed

during the time window of 𝑡.

Sentiment: According to the official statistics collected from
3.1.2
all social media platforms, 4.48 billion people are actively using
social media daily, roughly 57.7% of the world’s population3. There-
fore, we consider posts/tweets as an essential indicator of the price
trend and associate it with a sentiment score ([-1, +1]) and class
(from extremely negative to extremely positive).

Clearly, the cryptocurrency-related tweets do not reflect the
market equally, where the main indicator is the engagement (i.e.
the tweet’s reach and the number of interactions) with these tweets.
According to a recent statistic about Twitter Engagements 4, the
median number of likes and comments is 0, which means that a large
number of tweets receive little to no engagement at all. Therefore,
an equal sentiment weighting for all the tweets will not reflect
the actual scenario. Consequently, we propose the assign a weight
to each tweet, such that important tweets are highly weighted
compared to those with little engagement. Since it is complex to
assess which of the engagement factors is more important, the
weight is computed simply as the harmonic mean of the number of
likes, comments, retweets and quotes. Afterwards, the weights of
all tweets are normalized using min-max normalization. To form a
daily-interval sequence of sentiment scores, all weighted sentiments
of the published tweets for the date 𝑡 are averaged to form a single
value that represents the overall Twitter’s public sentiments on the
date 𝑡.

3.1.3 Blockchain details: According to the financial study con-
ducted by Krisoufek [16], Blockchain plays an important role in

strategy/new-global-social-media-research/
4https://mention.com/en/reports/twitter/engagement/2

Boukhers, et al.

affecting the price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies, especially B.
Therefore, we aim to embed multiple blockchain data that finan-
cial studies have proved to affect the market [16]. Using several
blockchain sources, we consider the following details for a given
day:
• Hash rate: the estimated hash rate that the B network is perform-

ing.

• Block size: the size of a complete B block.
• Block time: the time required to mine and produce a new B block.
• Network difficulty: the difficulty level of mining B blocks through

the network.

• Active Addresses: the total number of active addresses.
• Mining profitability: The estimated average mining profitability

for a single B block.
All the beforementioned blockchain attributes are sequential

with a one-day interval between each data point.

Search volumes. People’s curiosity is generally reflected through

3.1.4
various actions and nowadays, it is easier than ever to search on-
line, which makes it possible to understand public opinion through
search statistics. To this end, we consider the search volumes such
that any search containing either the word “Bitcoin” or the word
“BTC” is collected (see Appendix 6.3).

3.2 Fluctuation Analysis
As the main goal of this paper is to support investors’ decision-
making, only price forecasting is not sufficient because the cryp-
tocurrency market’s volatility is not uniform over time. Precisely,
if the fluctuation level is low, the model’s prediction is supposed
to be close to the actual one. In contrast, if the fluctuation level
is very high, the predicted price can be off from the actual value.
However, this fluctuation level is latent and up to our knowledge,
no existing approach proposes to capture it. Since the strength of
our approach is the combination of different modalities, we assume
that each of these modalities correlates independently to the price.
Intuitively, the fluctuation is low when all modalities conform and
high otherwise. Therefore, we aim to tackle RQ3 by analysing the
fluctuation with multiple varieties of the model to make multiple
predictions, such that each model is trained with different modali-
ties and dropout rate.

Input varieties: Given the AdaBoosting model described above
3.2.1
and fed with the Trading data, Twitter sentiments, Blockchain data,
and Online search volumes, several of its varieties are trained with
different modality combinations, where each of the model varieties
forecasts a slightly different price. Note that only the length of the
input layer is different between the architectures of these varieties:
• Trading data: The main component of any market, including
cryptocurrencies, is the historical trading data. Therefore, it is the
minimal data that can be used in cryptocurrency price forecasting.
The trading data consists of the 8 features mentioned earlier:
["Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume BTC", "Volume Currency",
"Weighted Price", "Average Fees"].

• Twitter sentiments: As discussed earlier, multiple research
works proposed that social media sentiments and public aware-
ness play a huge role in affecting the price fluctuation levels.
Abraham, et al. [2] proposed a B price prediction by applying

Ensemble and Multimodal Approach for Forecasting Cryptocurrency Price

only Twitter sentiments without any external data. The results
demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between social
media sentiments and price. Therefore, we consider a model vari-
ety that is fed with only twitter sentiment, which is represented
by ["The weighted twitter sentiments", "Tweet volumes"].

• Trading data with blockchain data: Blockchain data greatly
influences cryptocurrency prices, especially the hash rate, be-
cause it is their backbone, after all. This model’s variant takes as
input the concatenation of trading data feature and blockchain
details, namely ["Hash Rate", "Block Size", "Block Time", "Network
Difficulty", "Number of Active Addresses", "Mining Profitability"]
• Trading data with search volumes: Because the online search
volumes consist of only a single feature, it is nearly impossible
to make an accurate price prediction for a highly volatile market.
Therefore, it is advised to apply online search volumes along with
the trading data. Therefore, this model variant is fed with the
trading data concatenated with ["Online Search Volumes (Google
searches)"]

3.2.2 Model dropouts: We applied different dropout rates to differ-
ent layers of the final trained model. In addition to helping overcome
overfitting, we regularize the model with dropout rates to obtain
multiple variant outputs. With this, we aim at estimating an output
distribution given the outputs of six models with different dropout
rates:
• Model V_1, V_2 and V_3: A dropout with rates = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.35

at the LSTM’s last hidden layer.

• Model V_4, V_5 and V_6: A dropout with rates = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.35

at at the fc1’s output.

3.2.3 Predicted Price Distribution: We presume that fluctuation
distributions are great clues that a decision-maker can use to accu-
mulate information about the best possible actions to take. Together
with the price forecast, they provide the uncertainty levels of the
forecasting. To this end, we used Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(MLA) to estimate the parameters (i.e. Mean and Variance) of the
distribution given the sample of outputs. Given the the outputs
of the ten model varieties 𝑂 = {𝑜1, 𝑜2, . . . , 𝑜10}, the goal is to esti-
mate the set of parameters ˆ𝜃 = {𝜇, 𝜎2} that maximizes the function
𝑖=1 N (𝑜𝑖 ; 𝜃 ) such that ˆ𝜃 = arg max 𝐿(𝜃 ; 𝑂).
𝐿(𝜃 ; 𝑂) = (cid:206)10

4 EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-
proach from different aspects and against several baseline approaches.
All the implementations are publicly available and accessible on
GitHub5. The experimental setup are discussed in Appendix 6.2.

4.1 Datasets
Although there exists a lot of cryptocurrencies, B is the most dom-
inant one and its related data is easily accessible. Therefore, B is
the cryptocurrency use case considered in this paper, where we
collected data from the beginning of 2016 until the end of 2020. ,
resulting in a total of 1825 data points (days) split into 70% training,
15% validation, 15% testing, respectively as demonstrated in Figure
2.

Figure 2: The training, testing, validation data split (75%
training, 15% validation, 15% testing)

More details about the data can be found in Appendix 6.1.1

4.2 Baselines
To compare the performance of the proposed approach against
existing ones, we selected six methods, which are widely popular
and recent. Each of them has a different architecture and/or deals
with different data types to forecast the price of Bitcoin, namely:
• ARIMA19 [3]: This method is an ARIMA-based approach that
uses only the trading data of B to forecast the prices on the next
coming day.

• BNN17 [13]: A Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) implementation
to forecast B price on the near future using trading data collected
from 2011 until 2017.

• LSTM20A [30]: This method employs a multivariate LSTM for

cryptocurrency price forecasting from 2007 until 2017.

• LSTM20B [22]: Similarly, this method uses an LSTM architecture

to make forecasting on the data from 2016 until 2019.

• GRU20 [8]: This method uses Gated Recurrent Unit on a data

interval from 2010 until 2019.

• GRU21 [5]: This method also uses Gated Recurrent Unit but on a

data interval from 2017 until 2020.

• AdaBoost21 [6]: This method uses traditional AdaBoost algo-
rithm that takes advantage of multiple decision trees weak learn-
ers for price forecasting. Despite the simplicity of approach, it
could prove significant improvements over other sophisticated
approaches. This method covers covers the period from 2018
until 2020.

A primary limitation of comparing our approach against the
above-mentioned baseline approaches is that their implementations
are not publicly available. Consequently, we re-implemented these
approaches from scratch and reproduce their results. In addition,
because the baselines were developed and tested on a certain time
interval using specific datasets, all the approaches and the proposed
approach were applied on the same time interval and using the
exact dataset to ensure fairness.

4.3 Results and Discussion
In order to answer RQ1, we compared AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble
learning against LSTM on different modality combinations, where
both models are trained for 200 epochs and using the experimental

setup discussed in Appendix 6.2. Note that LSTM has the same
architecture as a single weak learner of AdaBoost-LSTM but trained
on the entire dataset. Table 1 illustrates the obtained results of
both models on (a) trading data only, (b) sentiments only and (c) the
combination of trading and sentiments. As clearly shown, AdaBoost-
LSTM ensemble learning significantly outperforms LSTM in the
three experiments. In (a) and (c), it can be observed that the overall
validation error of LSTM is lower, which can be explained by the
non-uniformity of the price trend and volatility over time. Since
LSTM tends to forecast smoothly compared to the weak learners
of AdaBoost-LSTM, it achieves a lower error when the volatility is
high. As shown in Figure 2, the period from 2012 until 2017 and
from the end of 2018 until 2019 experienced minor fluctuations
compared to other periods.

Figures 3 illustrate qualitative results of AdaBoost-LSTM and
LSTM on randomly sampled testing interval of 100 days. Here, the
blue curve represents the real price, the red curve represents the
LSTM price forecast and the green curve represents the forecasting
of AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning model. The Figures clearly
show that AdaBoost-LSTM follows better the price trend compared
to LSTM in all experiments.

Although the results of (a) validate the effectiveness of AdaBoost-
LSTM, they are still far from being reliable and support the state-
of-the-art finding that indicates the trading data cannot be enough
alone to reliably forecast cryptocurrency prices.

The results of (b) show an impressive discovery supporting the
hypothesis that social media sentiments correlate well with cryp-
tocurrency prices. However, the forecasting error is very high com-
pared to the results of trading data only, but it is important to note
that despite both models are fed with only a single input per day (i.e.
Twitter sentiments), they were able to capture the relation between
the prices and sentiments and make a meaningful price forecast.
The price forecast example shown in Figure 3b demonstrates that
AdaBoost-LSTM can follow the price trend using only sentiments.
In contrast, LSTM model struggles at learning any patterns within
the given input and appears to give a relatively constant forecasts
over time.

The results of (c) prove that the combination of trading data with
Twitter sentiments achieve the best results. This suggests that social
media sentiments can capture the cryptocurrency price fluctuation
and help the model make accurate price forecasts. Specifically, in-
corporating sentiment analysis to both models improved the results
by 15% compared to using only trading data.

Furthermore, we conducted additional experiments using LSTM,
AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning on trading data with the in-
clusion of different other modalities; (d) the hash rate, (e) search
volume and (f) blockchain data (i.e. all six attributes). Table 2 repre-
sents the obtained evaluation results of both models. Although the
error of (d) is slightly higher for AdaBoost-LSTM, which might be
caused by the boosting process, the low error obtained by LSTM
when including the hash rate indicates that it is a good factor to
accurately forecast the price.

The results of (e) show that search volumes did not rally affect
the performance of both LSTM and AdaBoost-LSTM when merged
with trading data. However, search volumes can be hypothesized
to perform better when merged with other attributes such as social
media sentiments because both represent “public awareness”.

The results of (f) for both models demonstrate that applying
blockchain information and trading data significantly improves
the forecasting performance compared to applying only the hash
rate. However, AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble learning testing errors are
considerably higher than those of LSTM. When using the blockchain
data as a single input to both models as illustrated in Figure 4,
AdaBoost-LSTM did not forecast the price accurately but could
follow the price trend. These results demonstrate the existence of
a correlation between blockchain data and cryptocurrency prices
to the extent that they can help models forecast the prices. Other
qualitative results are shown in Appendix 6.4.

To answer RQ2, we applied both LSTM and the AdaBoost-LSTM
ensemble learning model using the concatenation of all attributes.
Table 3 presents the obtained results, demonstrating that embedding

search volumes, and blockchain data) contribute to obtaining sig-
nificantly better results as there is an improvement of $75.312 in
MAE, resulting in a 36.32% improvement in the price forecasting
performance. The qualitative results on a 100-days interval for both
models are shown in Figure 5, where it is evident that obtained
forecasts are close to the actual price.

To further understand the performance of the model, an MAE
distribution for the whole testing set was calculated and visualized
in Figure 6. As can be seen that 68% of the times the price forecast
varies by +/−500$ of the price of 1 B , making the whole model’s
forecast extremely close to what the actual price is considering the
average price of B in the testing set is 16553.59.

To tackle RQ3, we propose to provide the investor with the price
forecast together with the fluctuation distribution. As it is very chal-
lenging to evaluate this quantitatively, we show in Figure 7 a few
results obtained by this technique for 6 random days. It is noticeable
that the price forecast certainty can differ from one day to another,
where if there is a massive volatility level on that particular day,
the price distribution is closer to be flat and has a high standard
deviation, which indicates that the price is highly likely to fluctuate
from the single model’s prediction. In contrast, when the model
gives a prediction with a high certainty level, it is apparent that
the price distribution has a high peak and low standard deviation.
All these prediction distributions are an excellent source for an
investor for decision-making as it provides a clear interpretation of
how confident the model is for a given prediction on a particular
day.

Boukhers, et al.

lected days

4.4 Long-term forecasting
Due to the good results of the proposed approach, we found it
interesting to push this approach to its limits and test to what extent
it can make predictions and what is its performance in making long-
term predictions. To this end, the model predicts the price of the
next 24th hour, and then the prediction is appended to the original
input to make another prediction for the second day, and repeat
this process for the next days until the 30th day. Please note that
for this experiments only price history is used as the other data
are assumed to by in the future. This automatically means that the
performance will drop given the fact that less data is used to infer
the next day’s price. Figure 8 illustrates the obtained results, where
the red curve represents the average MAE of each time-window
prediction, and the maximum and minimum MAE are shown by
the higher and lower boundaries of the blue area respectively. As
expected, the prediction is at its best in the first day and drops for
long-term predictions.

5 CONCLUSION
This paper presents a novel cryptocurrency price forecasting ap-
proach to support the investor decision-making process by pro-
viding reliable short-term price forecasts derived from all sources
proved to correlate with the price (RQ1). The proposed approach is
based on ensemble learning of multiple weak LSTM learners (RQ2),
which proved its outperformance over existing approaches. In addi-
tion to forecasting the price, the approach supports investors with

Ensemble and Multimodal Approach for Forecasting Cryptocurrency Price

Figure 8: Bitcoin price prediction absolute testing errors
over different time windows

fluctuation distributions that give a wider overview of the market
and how reliable is the price forecast (RQ3).

For future work, we aim to generate trading data with extremely
high volatility to be used in the training process. With this, we
assume that the model can be well prepared for unexpected market
volatility in the future that were never seen in the training process.
Our motivation is drawn from the fact that cryptocurrency markets
have been surprising us since their existence. In addition, we aim
to analyse the sentiments deeply because they have shown a great
support to the forecasting model.

6.1 Data details
6.1.1 Trading Data: There are several sources that provide this
sequential data. However, we noticed that it is likely that the data
of one source contain missing values and some days are simply
skipped. To overcome this, we collected the data from several
sources and combined them all together such that each one com-
plete the other, taking into consideration that the values might be
slightly different due to the fee differences. Our data is collected
from the following sources:
• Kaggle: an open-source dataset containing a 1-minute interval
data of B prices, collected from January 1, 2012 March 1, 2021.
• Binance: a large cryptocurrency exchange, whose data is pub-
licly available. Since no API is provided, the data was crawled
from the website using a custom python script to translate the
data from a visual format to a suitable csv format.

• Coinbase: a large cryptocurrency exchange, whose data is pub-
licly available. In contrast to Binance, Coinbase provides APIs to
collect the trading data, which is widely used (e.g. by Google)

Sentiments: Twitter is one of the top 5 social media platforms
6.1.2
in 2021 according to the number of active users with almost 202
million daily users and over 500 million tweets a day6. Therefore,
we consider Twitter as a source to analyze the public’s sentiments,
where the tweets are collected using Twitter Academic Research API
and TweetScraper.

A tweet is collected only if it belongs to the results of the query:
“q = ’Bitcoin’ or ‘BTC’ or #Bitcoin or #BTC”, which results in more
than 120 million tweets in the time window [Jan 2012, Dec 2021].
As per any social media data, the tweets contain a good portion of
spam tweets (Tweets that use hashtags to gain a more extensive
audience). Therefore, we removed every tweet that contains the
word Bitcoin as a hashtag and not as text. Furthermore, all the
emojis used are kept in their Unicode format to be used later with
a fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis.

As the goal of collecting these tweets is to analyse their senti-
ments, which is a separate subdiscipline by itself, we use in this
paper, two popular pretrained and publicly available sentiment
analysis tools, namely Vader [12] and Deeply Moving [28].

Vader [12] is a rule-based model for social media sentiment anal-
ysis. According to several recent evaluations, Vader outperforms
multiple state-of-the-art approaches that use rule-based or machine
learning. Also, Vader is supposed to generalize better across con-
texts than other approaches. The model outputs a sentiment score
ranging between [−1, 1], which reflects the sentiment of a given
post/tweet. The higher the sentiment score (i.e. up to +1), the more
the sentiment is positive, while 0 stands for neutral. Using this
score, the tweet is classified into one of the nine sentiment classes
(i.e. from extremely negative to extremely positive).

Deeply Moving[28] is another tool that analyses the text as a
whole entity to preserve the correlation between words. Mainly, this
approach is proposed to analyze movies’ reviews sentiments, mean-
ing that the text is formally represented, which is different from
the structure used in Twitter’s tweets (i.e. use of emojis, hashtags,
and abbreviations). Fine-tuning the model on tweets sentiments

6https://www.omnicoreagency.com/twitter-statistics/

Boukhers, et al.

is challenging due to the lack of labelled data. Therefore, we aim
to use both models to get the best of both worlds (a model that is
explicitly trained on tweets and a model that can understand the
sentiments of a whole sentence). Similarly to Vader, the Deeply
Moving model outputs a sentiment score in the range of [−1, 1],
where +1 indicates positive sentiment. Also, the sentiment score is
used to classify the tweet into one of the nine classes mentioned
previously.

Both sentiment analysis models (Vader, Deeply Moving) are
applied to all the tweets that were previously collected, where the
final sentiment score is computed as the average of both models’
scores.

6.1.3 Blockchain data: We collected the blockchain data from the
following source:

• Blockchain.com 7.
• Ycharts 8.

• Bitinfocharts 9.
• Nasdaq Data Link 10.

Search volumes: Google is the largest search engine with
6.1.4
over 52% of the world’s population using it every day11. Therefore,
it is one of the most excellent sources for collecting search statistics
because the results will cover a large portion of the total searches
made online. Therefore, we used Google API to collect this data.

6.2 Experimental Setup
All conducted experiments have multiple common setups outlined
as follows:

• Using the MSE as the training loss function.
• Using the Adam optimizer for all the experiments training as
an optimization algorithm for the convergence of the model.

• An initial learning rate of 0.0003.
• Training for 200 epochs.
• The dataset was normalized using the technique proposed

on the dataset subsection.

• The training was done on a GPU server with the following
specs: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor,
128GiB System memory, and NVIDIA GV100.

• All experiments use the MAE as a validation loss for every

ten epochs.
