ABSTRACT
Blockchain-based federated learning has gained significant interest
over the last few years with the increasing concern for data privacy,
advances in machine learning, and blockchain innovation. How-
ever, gaps in security and scalability hinder the development of
real-world applications. In this study, we propose ScaleSFL, which
is a scalable blockchain-based sharding solution for federated learn-
ing. ScaleSFL supports interoperability by separating the off-chain
federated learning component in order to verify model updates
instead of controlling the entire federated learning flow. We imple-
mented ScaleSFL as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hy-
perledger Fabric to demonstrate the feasibility of the solution. We
present a performance evaluation of results collected through Hy-
perledger Caliper benchmarking tools conducted on model creation.
Our evaluation results show that sharding can improve validation
performance linearly while remaining efficient and secure.

1 INTRODUCTION
With the increasing concern for data privacy and security of per-
sonal data, the demand for creating trusted methods of privacy-
preserving communication is rapidly increasing. Recent advances in

machine learning have also spurred interest in a variety of privacy-
sensitive domains such as healthcare informatics [1] and coron-
avirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnoses [2]. However, the privacy
of personal data used to train these models has been called into ques-
tion. Traditional methods of training require data to be centrally
located. However, this is challenging or impossible with privacy
regulations.

Federated learning (FL) [3] is a proposed solution allowing sensi-
tive data to remain distributed among edge devices. This framework
will enable devices to train models locally on-device and then up-
load their local model updates to a trusted central server to be
aggregated, resulting in a global model that is then distributed. This
process is repeated until the desired objective is reached, such as
the convergence of model accuracy.

Additional improvements have been made to the aggregation
strategies involved in traditional FL, notably in reducing the com-
munication overhead to the central aggregation server. Solutions
such as HierFavg [4] introducing a hierarchical scaling solution,
where model updates are instead sent to local edge servers perform-
ing partial model aggregation. This combines the benefits of both
centralized cloud and edge computing, resulting in both reduced
latency and communication overhead.

While the traditional FL framework has demonstrated its viabil-
ity in real-world applications, it has several notable issues. First,
model updates can indirectly leak the local data used to train them.
Specifically, users can be de-anonymized through data reconstruc-
tion via statistical analysis and data mining. An example of this
was with the Netflix Prize Dataset [5] where data was correlated
to users using an auxiliary IMDb dataset. The second issue is the
centralized nature of aggregating the model updates, which creates
a single point of failure and relies on trusted authorities.

Differential privacy [6, 7], a mathematical framework for evalu-
ating dataset privacy of a given model, can be employed to solve
the first issue, for example, by adding a certain noise to the model
update. A solution to the second issue is to utilize blockchain tech-
nologies to decentralize the task of aggregating the local model
updates. However, using a decentralized system incurs several more
issues by removing the presence of a centrally trusted entity which

 
 
 
 
 
 
gives rise to, for example, the problem of detecting malicious clients
sending false model updates.

Additionally, because local datasets do not necessarily repre-
sent the global distribution, as they are non-IID (independent and
identically distributed), two honest clients could submit opposing
model updates. This problem can be addressed by validating each
transaction. One possible solution is to allow each node to execute
validation procedures in a smart contract, as described in BAFFLE
[8]. However, delegating this task to every node of the network is
computationally expensive considering the high overhead, local
model training, and the consensus task [9]. Another solution is to
select a committee of nodes each round to perform this validation
task [9].

We can define the current number of clients training each round
as C, and the number of committee nodes (endorsing peers) as P𝐸 .
In each round, a total of C × P𝐸 computations must be completed
to validate all transactions.

Here, we propose a sharding mechanism extending the com-
mittee consensus method. As the network expands, clients will be
assigned to different shards within the network, and a committee
will be elected for each shard. After every phase, each shard’s com-
mittee will publish a local shard-aggregated model, which will then
be globally aggregated and redistributed to all clients. If we have
S many shards, this would reduce the global computations from
C × P𝐸 to C×P𝐸
S2

for each shard, or C×P𝐸

globally.

To preserve the security of the system across shards, we propose
a flexible protocol allowing for a pluggable poisoning mitigation,
and detection strategies [10–13]. This allows proposed models to
adopt suitable strategies, while allowing the system evolves with
recent advances.

Our key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

• a sharding framework called ScaleSFL, which supports a
sharding solution for blockchain-based federated learning.
We formally discuss the design of our algorithm for the
sharding mechanism based on two consensus levels: shard-
level consensus and mainchain consensus.

• an implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system
using Hyperledger Fabric [14] to run local experiments and
evaluate the solution effectiveness.

• benchmarks that we demonstrate the performance of our
implementation by using Hyperledger Caliper benchmark-
ing tools [15], showing our framework scales linearly with
the number of shards.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next sec-
tion provides background and related works. Our ScaleSFL frame-
work, a sharding solution for blockchain-based federated learning,
is introduced in Section 3. Evaluation and discussion are presented
in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, we conclude our work,
and describe future works in Section 6.

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS
Our current work integrates the ideas of federated learning and
differential privacy, as well as blockchain-based federated learning.
In this section, we introduce individual topics and corresponding
hybrid solutions to provide background.

2.1 Federated Learning and Differential

Privacy

Privacy-preserving machine learning combines the use of feder-
ated learning with differential privacy [16–18]. Federated learning
allows sensitive data from edge devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets,
IoT devices) to remain on-device while training is done locally
(distributed training on edge devices) [3]. In the original FL envi-
ronment, a centralized server manages the training process. The
server broadcasts the current model during each round to a sub-
set of participating nodes to activate local training (requesting a
model update). After all model update submission responses are
received, the server aggregates the local models into a global model
and prepares for the next round [3, 9]. While FL offers many pri-
vacy benefits, differential privacy in conjunction provides stronger
privacy guarantees [3] by mitigating data reconstruct-ability via
random model update noise.

McMahan et al. [3] proposed the Federated Averaging algorithm
(FedAvg). Their algorithm is a generalization of federated stochastic
gradient descent (FedSGD) [17] allowing each node to perform
multiple batch updates while exchanging the models’ parameters,
with which we based our FL model training approach. Experiments
demonstrate that FL can be used for training a variety of high-
quality machine learning models at reasonable communication
cost, exemplifying high practicality [3]. Therefore, we choose to
apply differential privacy and use an adapted version of FedAvg for
our current work.

Liu et al. [4] introduced HierFavg, a hierarchical scaling solution
introducing multiple edge servers, each performing partial model
aggregation, combining the benefits of both centralized cloud and
edge computing. While centralized servers benefit from the vast
reach of data collection, the communication overhead and latency
of downloading and evaluating such updates limit this approach.
Instead, model updates are sent to local edge servers to benefit
from fast and efficient model updates, reducing the number of local
iterations and total runtime. These local updates are then sent to a
cloud server allowing for a sampling of the global data distribution
to be considered and outperforming the local edge server perfor-
mance. Combining these approaches is nontrivial, and the authors
performed convergence analysis describing qualitative guidelines
in applying their approach. While our approach is primarily moti-
vated by increasing the throughput of model update metadata to
blockchain ledgers, the composition of shards can benefit from the
strategies found in hierarchical solutions.

2.2 Blockchain-Based Federated Learning
Blockchain technology can be utilized to decentralize the aforemen-
tioned centralized server in federated learning. The aggregation
and facilitation logic previously done by the central server can be
replaced by implementing smart contracts [9].

In addition to Ramanan and Nakayama’s blockchain-based aggre-
gator free federated learning (BAFFLE) [8] and Li et al.’s blockchain-
based federated learning framework with committee consensus [9]
referenced earlier, numerous strategies for integrating blockchain
technology with federated learning to achieve decentralization have
been considered [19]. However, the approaches proposed by previ-
ous works do not directly focus on the performance of their chosen

underlying consensus mechanism with which their proposed frame-
works are built upon.

2.2.1 Blockchain Integration. Kim et al.’s blockchain-based feder-
ated learning (BlockFL) [20] was implemented using the proof-of-
work consensus mechanism and focused on analyzing the end-to-
end latency of their system. Ma et al.’s proposed blockchain-assisted
decentralized FL (BLADE-FL) [21] was able to address the single
point of failure issue while analyzing the learning performance.
Liu et al.’s proposed federated learning with asynchronous con-
vergence (FedAC) method [22] seeks to improve communication
performance through integrating asynchronous global aggregation.
While these works focus on the performance of various system
components, they do not consider the scalability requirements for
large numbers of participants and the impact on the consensus
mechanism’s throughput.

Additionally, many blockchain-based federated learning applica-
tions with domain-specific frameworks have also been proposed.
For example, healthcare [23], IoT [24] and 6G networks [25]. Simi-
larly, these works focus on cutting-edge implementation plausibility
rather than scalability or details regarding the performance of their
consensus mechanisms.

Gai et al. [26] proposed a model that utilizes a blockchain-based
solution to develop a privacy-preserving environment for task al-
locations in a cloud/edge system. Employing blockchain enhances
trustworthiness in edge nodes and security in communications.
Utilizing smart contracts also contributes toward reaching optimal
task allocations. The model applies a differential privacy algorithm
(Laplace distribution mechanism [6]) to process energy cost data in
edge nodes.

Li et al. [9] proposed a blockchain-based FL framework with com-
mittee consensus in response to consensus mechanism efficiency
and framework scalability. The committee consensus mechanism
works as follows: A subset of nodes constitutes a committee re-
sponsible for validating model updates and new block generation.
Meanwhile, the other nodes only execute their local model training
and send their updates to the committee nodes. This committee is
re-elected every round based on scores from the previous round,
or alternatively, re-election is randomized for implementation sim-
plicity. Li et al. demonstrated that committee consensus is more
efficient and scalable while remaining secure.

Sharding Solutions. Sharding allows for scalability by split-
2.2.2
ting the network into smaller subgroups. This reduces storage and
communication requirements while increasing throughput as the
number of shards increases.

Yuan et al. [27] proposed ChainFL, a two-layered blockchain-
driven FL system that splits an IoT network into multiple shards.
Also using Hyperledger Fabric [14], ChainFL adopts a direct acyclic
graph (DAG)-based mainchain to achieve parallel (and asynchro-
nous) cross-shard validation. While their approach is DAG-based,
we focus on a hierarchical FL solution, and are able to use existing
off-chain FL frameworks to increase interoperability.

2.3 Model Update Poisoning
A notable issue when aggregating model updates from untrusted
and potentially adversarial clients are model poisoning attacks. In

order to disrupt or bias the training process, and adversary may
submit biased, or corrupted model updates. Because model updates
must be verified prior to being accepted to the ledger, we consider
each defence mechanism applied to each endorsing peer rather than
a single centralized server. One possibility to make the training
more robust is to apply norm constraints to each model update,
such as clipping model updates and applying random noise to the
aggregated model to prevent overfitting [28]. However, further
mechanisms are required to counter adversarial examples and back-
doors [29]. A subset of model poisoning is data poisoning attacks.
These occur when the clients’ dataset has been altered, such as
a targeted attack by adversarial manipulation of edge devices, or
untargeted such as a faulty data collection process, resulting in
corrupted samples (e.g., incorrect labels). Here, we focus on readily
applicable works related to the general detection of poisoned model
updates.

Barreno et al. [10] proposed a technique to determine which
samples from a training set are malicious. To do so, they present the
reject on negative influence (RONI) defence. This method measures
the effect each training sample has on the accuracy of the model.
This defence strategy is appropriately modified to suit the needs
of a FL setting. Instead, we measure the influence of each model
update on the accuracy of the global model. This can be done by
utilizing a held-out testing set, potentially unique to each endorsing
peer. This defence is not suitable for general FL applications due to
the nature of client data being non-IID and incorrectly rejected due
to misrepresentation by the test set. Additionally, malicious updates
may go unnoticed due depending on the threshold of acceptance.
Blanchard et al. [11] introduced a method designed to counter ad-
versarial updates in a FL setting. Multi-Krum is a byzantine-resilient
defence strategy that selects 𝑛 vectors furthest from the calculated
mean, removing them from the aggregated gradient update. These
distances are calculated based on the euclidean distance between
gradient vectors. This strategy is effective for attacks with up to 33%
compromised/adversarial clients. However, the calculated mean can
be influenced by the Sybil updates and may fail for an attacker with
more significant influence over the network.

Fung et al. [12] proposed a novel defence strategy to discriminate
between honest clients and Sybils based on the diversity of their
respective gradient updates. The intuition behind this defence is to
identify Sybils based on a shared objective, and thus their models’
updates are likely to have low variance. This works by using a cosine
similarity, looking for similarity in terms of indicative features
(i.e., those that contribute to the correctness of the update). This
approach can be further augmented with other defence methods
such as Multi-Krum to determine the poisoned updates.

Wan and Chen [13] introduced an attack-adaptive defence uti-
lizing an attention-based neural network to learn plausible attacks.
Instead of using similarity-based mechanisms, this introduces tai-
lored defence strategies to prevent backdoor attacks.

Ma et al. [30] explored differential privacy as a data poisoning
defence based on creating a robust learning algorithm. While this
defence is ideal for systems already using differential privacy, it
enforces the use of noise in the learning algorithm, hurting per-
formance. Additionally, this assumes a small subset of malicious
clients, failing to defend against larger coordinated attacks.

Figure 1: Global overview of our FL sharding approach

Related attacks, such as model update plagiarism [21], may addi-
tionally occur, leading to a misleading distribution of data amongst
clients. A malicious user may attempt to submit the same model
update multiple times through several clients, known as lazy clients.
They may then attempt to reap the rewards of contribution for each
of these submissions. These can be detected by using a PN-sequence
[21, 31], whereby the initial model update is submitted with random
noise applied to the update and is then further verified by other
clients using their own PN-sequence, checking for correlation.

3 OUR SHARDING SOLUTION
This section describes our approach and outlines the architecture
for our proposed sharding solution. An outline of the workflow can
be seen in Figure 1. We can break this into two primary components,
the mainchain, which coordinates aggregated models from shards,
and the individual shard chains.

Our framework follows a few core principles. Our solution is
modular such that (a) the policies that govern model acceptance
are abstracted, for example, model update poisoning, and miti-
gation strategies (Section 2.3), are supported to determine model
acceptance. Our framework additionally (b) supports external FL
coordination, such that new paradigms such as data-centric FL are
supported. This means the source of models updates is agnostic.

With these principles, our solution acts as an additional compo-
nent to existing FL workflows such that it handles model prove-
nance, the evolution of security and poisoning defences, scalability
through sharding, and the possibility of reward distribution for
future works. Therefore, we solve the initial problem of FL systems
being dependent on a central service to aggregate updates, provid-
ing a trusted system to pin verified model updates. We will further
discuss the components of this system below.

3.1 FL Algorithm
The underlying problem of federated learning is to produce a
global model from client updates trained on local privacy-sensitive
datasets. We can define each client C𝑘 to have their own set of
data 𝐷𝑘 ⊆ 𝐷, ∀𝑘, 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝐾. Using this, we can define the global
objective to optimize as a modification of the FedAvg algorithm [3]
as

𝑓 (𝑤)

𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑤 ∈𝑅𝑑

and 𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑤 ∈𝑅𝑑

𝐹𝑘 (𝑤)

for each client

(1)

where the batch loss for each client is defined as

𝑓𝑏𝑘,𝑖 (𝑤) =

1
|𝑏𝑘 |

∑︁

𝑥𝑖 ∈𝑏𝑘,𝑖

𝑙 (𝑥𝑖, 𝑤𝑘 )

(2)

and 𝑏𝑘,𝑖 being a random subset from 𝐷𝑘 . Each client updates their
local objective with respect to their dataset 𝐷𝑘 by

𝑤𝑘 ← 𝑤𝑘 − 𝜂𝑘 ∇𝑓𝑏𝑘,𝑖 (𝑤𝑘 )
where 𝜂𝑘 is the clients learning rate. The clients objective then
becomes

(3)

𝐹𝑘 (𝑤) =

1
|𝐷𝑖 |

∑︁

𝑏𝑘,𝑖 ∈𝐷𝑖

𝑓𝑏𝑘 (𝑤)

and so the shards objective will become

𝐺𝑠 (𝑤) =

𝐾
∑︁

𝑘

|𝐷𝑘 |
𝐷

𝐹𝑘 (𝑤)

This can be defined as weight updates by

𝑤𝑠 ← 𝑤𝑠 +

𝐾
∑︁

𝑘

|𝐷𝑘 |Δ𝑤𝑘
𝐷

(4)

(5)

(6)

noted that while these plugins are applied at a task level to main-
tain the network’s security, they can be upgraded with the smart
contract that they are governing.

Another quality to consider is the detection of lazy clients. De-
tection of these clients may use a PN-sequence, which is applied
to the model updates. This technique could then be applied within
the shard level consensus to verify the clients’ PN-sequence.

Because each shard contains a subset of the total participants for
each task, the algorithmic complexity of consensus is significantly
reduced to C×P𝐸
. As a result, the network overhead needed to
S2
communicate model updates is also significantly reduced, which is
the primary bottleneck in peer-to-peer federated learning.

3.3 Mainchain Consensus
The mainchain is responsible for coordinating all verified aggre-
gated model updates from each shard. This chain contains all par-
ticipants across all shards; however, the activity on this chain is
limited to shard level aggregation results and task proposals. The
consensus for this follows the same pluggable consensus policy
as the Shard level consensus (Section 3.2); however, the submit-
ting peers are limited only to the subset of endorsing peers on the
shard chains. In this way, we limit the endorsing peers to those
in possession of an aggregated model and are able to verify its
authenticity.

All accepted model updates to the mainchain will have been
endorsed by each shard endorsing peers, which can safely be dis-
tributed and aggregated. If multiple models from a single shard
have been accepted by disagreements between a shards endorsing

This happens in parallel across all shards, where the global objective
will become the sum of the results produced across all shards

𝑓 (𝑤) =

𝑆
∑︁

𝑠

|𝐷𝑠 |
𝐷

𝐺𝑠 (𝑤)

(7)

We should note that this described approach follows the original
FedAvg algorithm and can be modified in terms of fairness [32]
among other averaging strategies.

3.2 Shard Level Consensus
Each task deployed on the network can run an independent con-
sensus mechanism. This allows for various task-related workloads
to be accommodated by adapting the consensus algorithm. For ex-
ample, when training large models where the performance of a
single node may be limited, mechanisms such as PBFT [33] can be
used. However, in shards with a fewer number of clients, we can
make use of Raft consensus [34]. This may benefit settings where
model complexity is lower, and so a peer may be able to handle
the throughput bottleneck of Raft consensus, determined by node
performance.

Within the chosen consensus mechanism, we apply a pluggable
policy to determine the acceptance of model writes. This policy can
be substituted to handle alternative schemes (Section 2.3). These
schemes handle the identification of malicious clients by finding
poisoned model updates or detecting Sybil attacks. It should be

Figure 2: Aggregation of sharded models

peers, the model with more endorsements will win. So, if the en-
dorsing peers submit the same model (model hashes are identical),
the endorsing peers can safely evaluate the model update once.
Figure 2 shows this process. The final step here is to post the final
global model of the mainchain. This model represents the result
after a single round of FL, and each of the shards will start the next
round with these parameters.

We note that a new round may begin earlier within a shard
by assuming the model aggregated by a shard endorsing peers is
valid before it is accepted to the mainchain. If this model is not
accepted, then the round within that shard must be restarted. This
should only happen if the majority of endorsing peers within a
shard are compromised, and as such, the disruption will only affect
the compromised shard.

3.4 Workflow
This section discusses the entire workflow of our proposed frame-
work, discussing the steps required to produce a trained model.

Firstly, we define the participants’ category in our system. We
can break this into three categories: clients, peers, and endorsing
peers, and described as follows.

(1) Clients: In a traditional FL setting, all participants are con-
sidered to be clients, where they are comprised of typical
IoT devices such as smartphones, laptops, appliances, and
vehicles, among others. Clients hold the private datasets that
will be used for training models and are they are respon-
sible for producing model updates. We consider the same
assumption here, where clients do not validate models but
rely on more powerful devices to ensure the system’s se-
curity. This is the lightest class of participants in terms of
resource consumption.

(2) Peers: Peers are responsible for holding copies of the ledger.
From this pool of peers, a committee can be elected to re-
duce the evaluation overhead. This helps take the load off of
endorsing peers and allows peers to offer API services for
clients.

(3) Endorsing peers: Members of the committee are respon-
sible for evaluating model updates during consensus. They
hold their own private dataset to endorse other model up-
dates and can submit their own model updates, although they
are not required to do so. Furthermore, the policy for evalua-
tion of model weights can be modified, and these peers addi-
tionally must check for valid authentication of the write-set.
Finally, committee members must participate in the main-
chain consensus to determine which shard level updates will
be accepted.

These participants will then participate in one or more tasks, as
managed by the mainchain smart contract. Starting from a fresh
network, we will describe the following process.

3.4.1 Task Proposal. The procedure begins with a task proposal
on the application layer. It will be proposed on the mainchain in
the form of a smart contract, and it outlines the requirements and
task description. We leave the details of this specification open, as
we may not know the complete set of features or optimization level
objectives as such in a vertical FL (VFL) scenario [35]. Once this
proposal has garnered enough interest in client registration, a new

shard will be provisioned, and shard-related smart contracts will
be deployed to the newly created shard(s). These processes can be
thought of as an open request for participants to collaborate on a
specific task.

3.4.2 Client Training. Within a specific shard, an off-chain coor-
dination network will be formed as defined by the proposal. This
could utilize existing FL frameworks and best practices, and new
paradigms. As such, the fraction of clients fit within a specific
round will be determined off-chain by this process and exclude,
for example, currently unavailable clients due to battery or net-
work coverage issues. These selected clients are then responsible
for producing a model update to the global model weights 𝑤. Each
required client will then compute their local updates as seen in
Eq. (4). We can see this as Step 1 in Figure 3.

3.4.3 Off-Chain Model Storage. A client will then optionally up-
load a model to an off-chain cache such as InterPlanetary File
System (IPFS) [36]. At this stage, the model can be downloaded
publicly; however, it has not yet been verified nor recorded on the
ledger yet. This step is used to record historical models or take the
network load off of serving local model updates to peers. We can
see this as Step 2 in Figure 3.

3.4.4 Model Submission. Once the model has been uploaded and is
available for download, the client will submit the update metadata
by invocation of the shard level smart contract. This update should
include information such as the model’s hash value and a link from
which the model can be downloaded. This can be seen in Step 3 in
Figure 3.

3.4.5 Peer Endorsement. The peers on the shard must endorse this
model update according to the shard level consensus mechanism
(Section 3.2). This work could be offloaded to the peers’ local work-
ers, where additional computing resources may be present. This
can be seen in Steps 4 and 5 in Figure 3.

3.4.6 Model Evaluation. The peers’ local workers request the model
weight update from the link specified in the model update. The
downloaded model will then be verified against the submitted hash
to ensure integrity. Once the model is verified, it can be evaluated
by various techniques; for example, the peer may test the model
against its local dataset and reject the update on sufficient degra-
dation in performance, such as in the RONI defence. This would
be ideal in cases where the data distribution is known to be IID.
Alternative solutions such as the FoolsGold scheme may be used
for non-IID data, which could be used to identify poisoning attacks
from Sybils. The results of this will be returned from the worker
back to the peer. Here, we have summarized Steps 6-8 in Figure 3.

Shard Aggregation. Endorsed model updates are written to
3.4.7
the ledger according to the consensus quorum. The off-chain FL
process can continue by aggregating the models from the current
round if they have been accepted into the ledger. These models will
then be downloaded and aggregated by the coordinating servers
according to Eq. (7). These aggregated models will then be published
to the mainchain. Similarly, these aggregated shard updates are
only be accepted if the committee of endorsing peers reaches a
consensus on the update governed by the mainchains consensus
mechanism (Section 3.3).

Figure 3: Transaction flow for shard level model submission

3.4.8 Global Aggregation. Finally, all accepted shard level model
updates accepted to the mainchain will be downloaded and aggre-
gated by the shard level servers. The peers can easily verify these
models by checking the hash of the new distributed global model
against the posted hash from the mainchain for the finalized FL
round.

4 EXPERIMENTS
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed sharding solution,
we evaluate the performance in a Proof of Concept (PoC) implemen-
tation1. The purpose of experimentation here is first to measure
the throughput of a FL workload scale with respect to the number
of shards. Secondly, we measure the sharding impact on model
performance in both IID and non-IID scenarios. It is important to
ensure the quality of models and keep the rate of convergence low
when a potential subset of peers are malicious.

To run these experiments, we use Hyperledger Fabric [14], a per-
missioned distributed ledger platform. This platform offers a mod-
ular architecture allowing for plug-n-play consensus and member-
ship services. Hyperledger Fabric offers an execute-order-validate
architecture for transactions, allowing each peer to evaluate mod-
els in parallel within each shard. This is opposed to most public
blockchain platforms that first order transactions and execute them
sequentially. Fabric additionally offers modular endorsement and

1https://github.com/blockchain-systems/ScaleSFL

validation policies which we will use to implement custom consen-
sus logic within an endorsement plugin. We will read in a proposal
response payload, sending the given transaction read-write set to
the peers’ worker for validation. This read-write set contains the
necessary information to endorse or reject the proposed model
update. This will be built directly into the Fabric peers.

Our solution workflow may be adapted to alternative permis-
sioned platforms such as Quorum [37], or public platforms such as
Ethereum [38], which may allow for additional reward allocation
schemes. Implementations on these platforms may consider the
use of child chains utilizing existing layer-2 scaling solutions. We
choose Hyperledger Fabric for our PoC primarily for the flexibility
of consensus and membership services during development.

Tests here are run locally on a single machine simulating a Fabric
test-network with a single orderer running Raft [34], and eight
peers, each with their own organization, along with a certificate
authority. Each peer worker runs on a single thread, allowing each
peer to act independently. The experimental configuration can be
seen in Table 1.

We implement two smart contracts to implement both the main-
chain consensus and shard level consensus mechanisms. Smart con-
tracts, otherwise known as chaincode in Fabric, will be deployed
to a specific channel within Fabric. We use channels to simulate
shards, where each channel operates independently with the ability

level smart contract we term the “models" chaincode to each chan-
nel. Each participant operating within a shard will be assigned to a
shard by our managing contract. We deploy the mainchain consen-
sus on its own channel, in which every peer from every shard will
join. We term this the catalyst contract, where it is responsible for
aggregating a global model from each of the shards. As mentioned
previously, model updates are stored off-chain. In this implemen-
tation, each peers worker hosts the models locally with a gRPC
server.

We coordinate the FL processes off-chain while pinning updates
back to each shard’s ledger. This coordination is abstracted from the
approach discussed previously; in this case, we use the Flower [39]
an open-source extensible FL framework. In this implementation,
during aggregation, submitted models are verified to have been
endorsed, which can be checked by querying the peers’ local ledger
to reduce a round of communication. This is conducted by creating
a custom strategy within the Flower server and modifying the
aggregated fit to filter out any updates which are not present on-
chain, by querying the models’ smart contract. We additionally
implement differential privacy using Opacus [40], applied during
client training. We use an (𝜖, 𝛿) target of (5, 1e−5), a noise multiplier
of 0.4, and a max gradient norm of 1.2.

4.1 Evaluation
For evaluation, we employ Hyperledger Caliper [15], an open source
benchmarking tool allowing for various workloads to be conducted
for our system under test (SUT). These tests are performed by
an independent process that generates transactions to be sent to
the SUT by a specified configuration, monitoring for responses to
determine metrics such as latency, throughput and success rate.
We conduct tests with varying numbers of workers, transactions
counts, and transactions per second (TPS) to evaluate the limits of
the system.

We run several workloads to test the effects of sharding on
transaction throughput and model performance. The benchmark
tasks include:

• Update creation throughput: We first run an experiment
to test the throughput of model creation. To do this, we
generate a number of models updates, make the parameters
available locally, and have the endorsing peers evaluate them
during consensus. In this way, we can measure how sharding
affects the performance of the consensus mechanism by
parallelizing the workload among shards. We aim to verify
our initial claim that the global computations required with
become P×C
S .

• Model performance: We evaluate the performance of the
models across two scales: (1) the global number of epochs
computed and (2) the number of gradients, which provide

more accurate measures of performance for decentralized
training [27]. While we are primarily concerned with the
performance of integrating existing FL solutions into the
blockchain, sharding should allow a larger fraction of clients
to be fit, allowing for model performance to be increased.

4.2 Datasets
For experimentation, we use three datasets, namely the MNIST
dataset [41] consisting of 60,000 28x28 images of handwritten digits,
and the CIFAR-10 dataset [42] which consists of a dataset of 60,000
32×32 images separated into 10 classes with 6,000 images per class.
We use these to represent IID data, where these classes of data are
split evenly between clients.

For non-IID scenarios, we use the LEAF dataset [43] which can
be used to test model performance by partitioning the data between
peers in a reproducible way. In this setting, the classes of data
may not be evenly split. For example, in the case of the Federated
Extended MNIST (FEMNIST) dataset, characters were split by the
writer of the digit or character. This can be a strong benchmark to
model real-world distributions of data.

These datasets are used as a common baseline for comparison and
evaluation against previous solutions [3, 22, 27], showing the addi-
tion of a sharding solution maintains competitive results on model
performance. While a non-IID assignment of data across shards
may influence the generated global model during the global aggre-
gation stage, the selection of mainchain defence mechanisms plays
the largest role in model convergence. Thus, the results generated
by the chosen datasets demonstrate the applicability of sharding
solutions to existing Blockchain-based methods.

4.3 Results
We created multiple workloads for the Update Creation Throughput
benchmark to explore the effectiveness of our sharding solution.
These workloads are conducted without malicious updates using the
MNIST [41] dataset to evaluate the performance of model creation
transactions. We set the timeout period for each transaction to 30
seconds, allowing us to consider the number of failed transactions
as stale (i.e., not malicious). In this experiment, each of the clients
evaluated the update against their entire local dataset, in which we
have used the entire test split of the MNIST dataset for each client.
We first measure the throughput with respect to the number
of shards, as seen in Figure 4. This workload uses two Caliper
workers, evaluated over 200 transactions, where we can see the
throughput for each independently operating shard which allows
the global throughput to scale linearly. This directly reflects the
time for the evaluation of a model that is the primary bottleneck.
We note here that the sent TPS for each number of shards is set
just above its throughput in order to saturate the system for the

Figure 4: #shards vs. system throughput (TPS)

Figure 6: Transaction count sent vs. average response la-
tency & failure count

To test the maximum throughput achieved by our system, we
measure the sent TPS against the system throughput and average
latency. See Figure 5. This workload is run with 2 caliper workers
over 200 transactions. As we increase the sent TPS, the system
will reach a point where it becomes saturated and is unable to
handle a higher TPS. We can see this by looking at the point where
the average latency begins to increase in the figure, where the
throughput is maximized. We conduct this workload by measuring
sent TPS in increments of 3, starting from 3 TPS. We can see each
additional shard increases the overall system throughput similarly
in Figure 4 while demonstrating the maximum throughput limit.

To explore the limits of a usage surge, we measure the number
of transactions sent by system throughput, average latency, and
failure rate. In this benchmark, we are interested in the system’s
behaviour under a workload with a higher sent TPS than through-
put. This workload is run with 2 caliper workers and a sent TPS
just above the maximum throughput as seen in the previous work-
load. See Figure 6. When the system cannot handle the number
of transactions currently queued, the average latency will spike,
and the number of failed requests will increase because the sys-
tem begins timing out requests. The system will then go through
a “flush" period where many long-running requests begin to fail,
so the average latency of successful requests will drop. We note

Figure 5: Sent TPS vs. system throughput (TPS) & average
response latency

evaluation. In this workload, we used the same number of sent
transactions for consistency; however, higher numbers of shards
have shown improvements in throughput for increased transactions
sent, while a lower number of shards may begin to fail earlier.

Figure 7: Transaction count sent vs. System throughput
(TPS)

here that the average latency peaks at around 16 seconds due to
the average between the maximum latency (the timeout limit) and
the minimum latency, which corresponds to the time it takes to
evaluate a model fully.

Figure 7 shows the throughput over this workload, where the
throughput of the system decreases when it is no longer able to
handle the number of incoming requests, as the overhead to process
these additional requests limits the number of successful requests
processed. The decrease in throughput corresponds to the increase
in average latency previously observed.

We finally test how the system handles concurrent requests. To
do so, we run multiple workloads, varying the number of caliper
workers, and measuring the system throughput and average latency.
This workload configuration sends 200 transactions, with the sent
TPS equal to the previously-mentioned maximum throughput. This
can be in Figure 8. We observe that the throughput of the system
with respect to the number of workers is quite noisy, however, there
is a general downward trend in the system throughput. Increasing
the number of caliper workers here allows us to scale the workload
generation, however since the endorsement workers evaluating
the model operate sequentially in these experiments (limited to a
single thread), The throughput is limited. Similarly, we can see an
upward trend in average latency caused by each transaction’s time
waiting for execution in the queue. We can see that the number of
shards plays the largest factor here as workloads with more than 2
shards are tightly grouped with respect to average latency due to
these workloads being able to operate in parallel across shards.

To measure model performance, we measure the effect of various
training parameters. We use minibatch sizes of 𝐵 ∈ {10, 20}, and
local epoch sizes of 𝐸 ∈ {1, 5, 15}. We present results here from
the non-IID MNIST dataset, however similar results hold for both
CIFAR-10, and LEAF benchmarks. The effects of both minibatch
size and local epoch sizes can be seen in Figure 9, and Table 2, where
we compare our ScaleSFL solution and the traditional FedAvg al-
gorithm. This comparison is performed under the assumption all
clients are honest, and thus we are simply comparing the effect of

Figure 8: Caliper workers vs. system throughput (TPS) & av-
erage response latency

on the MNIST dataset

sharding. Both training loss and accuracy are considered, and work-
flows are run for 15 global epochs, where the number of ScaleSFL

shards is set to 8, with each shard sampling eight clients each round,
making for a total of 64 clients. The FedAvg algorithm is compara-
bly run with 64 clients, with both methods using a client learning
rate of 𝜂𝑘 = 1𝑒 − 2.

In Figure 9, we observe the convergence rate of ScaleSFL is faster
than the FedAvg algorithm, generally reaching an accuracy of 0.98
within the 15 global epochs considered. This is due to the paral-
lelized nature of ScaleSFL, where each shard can simultaneously
filter and produce viable updates with reasonable client sampling
rates, combining them to produce a stronger global model at each
step.

5 DISCUSSION

Hierarchical Sharding. Since each shard operates indepen-
dently, several additional improvements over a traditional FL work-
flow can be achieved. For example, a typical device selection step
is usually performed, sampling a subset of the available devices for
each round. However, since the population of each shard is much
smaller than the global population, each shard’s ability to update
and maintain active devices becomes more efficient, and during
aggregation, a much larger sampling of devices can be used from
the global population.

Additional optimizations could be achieved by placement of
clients based on region [4]. Since each client may submit their
model to an off-chain cache such as IPFS, shards with a population
based within the same region could reduce overhead latency. In this
way, the overhead only occurs during the global aggregation phase.
The possibility of single-shard takeover attacks may be introduced
by not using a random sampling scheme. However, as noted before,
this disruption will only affect the compromised shard since all
endorsing peers from all shards must agree on which shard level
updates are aggregated. This may allow for region based sampling
algorithms to be used for the assignment of participants. These
strategies should be chosen depending on the underlying task,
potentially chosen by the task submitter, or consensus among task
participants prior to shard creation.

Alternative participant sampling can be considered in the case of
cross-silo or consortium based settings such as medical or financial
organizations. For example, it may be beneficial to allow clients of
a particular organization to be grouped under a single shard [27].
Fine-grained control oversampling and permissions are delegated
independently within each shard.

Model Provenance. By pinning model information back to the
mainchain, we provide an open model hub for sharing and distribut-
ing trained models in a decentralized fashion. Model submission
to IPFS additionally allows for transparent model check-pointing
and disaster recovery. In the case that a bug has been introduced
at some point in the FL process, either intentionally through ma-
licious attack, or by data bias or incompatibility, previous model
checkpoints may be restored, and a new task may be initiated using
this saved model checkpoint.

Rewards Allocation. While our implementation of ScaleSFL
uses Hyperledger Fabric, alternative implementations may consider
platforms such as Ethereum [38] for implementation of reward
mechanisms. Since training models in a permissionless fashion
may result in decreased contributions, due to the availability of
models through a model hub, and without expending computing
resources, rewards become an integral part of the workflow. While
access to the models should remain free, contributing computing
resources should be rewarded by distributing rewards to the con-
tributing clients. Additional incentives could be provided by task
contributors or interested clients, to “sweeten the pot", encouraging
community contributions. Additionally, with the incorporation of a
native cryptocurrency, submitting models transactions could incur
a small gas fee. This would prevent attempted Denial of Service
(DOS) attacks against the system since the rewards for model con-
tributions are only realized for non-malicious updates. However,
common DOS attacks may generate random model updates or send
updates with dead cache links.

Alternative Attacks. Up to this point, we have discussed mali-
cious clients as clients which send poisoned model updates. How-
ever, malicious clients may attempt various alternate types of at-
tacks, such as uploading a different model than specified in the
task request or making the model update very large, attempting to
perform a DOS attack on a shard. These attacks may be prevented
by checking the size of the model uploaded to the cache prior to
download. However, a more clever client may attempt to submit a
legitimate model many times, attempting to either reap the rewards
for training, or to perform a DOS attack against the system. These
clients are known as lazy nodes [21]. They additionally attempt
to copy another client’s model update during a gossip phase. This
problem has severe negative effects on global model performance,
so updates from these lazy nodes should be discarded. One way
to recognize these lazy nodes is to publish model updates with a
pseudo-noise (PN) sequence, and then subsequently publish the
PN sequence after each client has published their model update.
Lazy nodes will be spotted by checking the correlation between
the model updates and the published PN sequence [21]. Gas fees
should deter spotted clients, and Sybils from attempting to submit
further model updates. Incorporating the defence into our workflow
would modify the off-chain model storage step, ensuring all models
submitted during model submission have a valid PN signature.

6 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a sharding solution for blockchain based
federated learning. We described a modular workflow, allowing for
pluggable defence mechanisms and poisoning mitigations strategies.

This workflow supports off-chain FL frameworks to be used, while
pinning verified model updates to the blockchain. We additionally
implement a proof-of-concept of ScaleSFL using Hyperledger fabric.
Our experimental results demonstrated that ScaleSFL improves
validation performance linearly with the addition of shards. This
helps address the prevalent scalability issue related to blockchain
consensus by demonstrating the impact of sharding.

As ongoing and future work, we further explore the details of
a sharded solution applied to the blockchain. Specifically, we aim
to simulate malicious attacks on the system via model poisoning
updates. This would show the effectiveness of a blockchain solu-
tion to provide security against bad actors. Additionally, we will
explore the application of a reward mechanism for participating
in the model training process for our current system. This could
be explored on other chains such as Ethereum [38], where the use
of native tokens is well-supported. Finally, we would like to imple-
ment a more full-featured implementation of this PoC, including
dynamic shard creation and allowing model proposition through
our catalyst contract.
