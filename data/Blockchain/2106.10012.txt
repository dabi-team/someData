XRP is a modern crypto-asset (crypto-currency) developed by Ripple Labs, which has been increas-
ing its ﬁnancial presence. We study its transaction history available as ledger data. An analysis of
its basic statistics, correlations, and network properties are presented. Motivated by the behavior of
some nodes with histories of large transactions, we propose a new index: the “Flow Index.” The
Flow Index is a pair of indices suitable for characterizing transaction frequencies as a source and
destination of a node. Using this Flow Index, we study the global structure of the XRP network and
construct bow-tie/walnut structure.

Presented at the“Blockchainin Kyoto”(February17–18,2021),and will appear in the JPS Confer-
enceProceedings.

Introduction

The world of crypto-assets is dynamic and complex (we use the term “crypto-asset” instead of
“crypto-currency” throughout this paper. See [1]). Its presence in the ﬁnancial market has steadily
increased since its inception in early 2013. Understanding the nature of this world is important.

Ever since its inception, all transaction data (except for a few, which we will elaborate in the next
section) are stored and available through various media, providing researchers with ample opportunity
to study the intriguing properties, similar to Bitcoin. [2–4].

Traditional monetary transactions through ﬁnancial institutions, such as banks, are crucial for
analyzing and understanding inter-ﬁrm and ﬁrm-household relationships. However, the availability
of such data is quite limited because of privacy concerns, except for a few rare cases [5].

In this study, we present a basic analysis of the XRP world observed through ledger data, which
is the transaction record comprising the amount of XRP, source account, destination account, and
the day and time (in coordinated universal time (UTC)) of transactions. (For a reasonable and read-
able introduction to XRP, see [6].) Accounts are just 33 letter-long codes such as “rfceigRxmgA-
jWR6LH1L7YsooWKMqM5Pr6,” and no other information on the owner (name, address, etc.) are
available. Although this makes interpreting the results of analysis rather diﬃcult, because of its im-
portance and data availability, it remains a worthwhile endeavor.

In Section 2, we describe our ledger data and its basic properties, including the distribution of
the number of transactions, properties of the time series with the day-of-the-week analysis, and cor-
relations. Section 3 is devoted to analyzing the XRP network of the transactions, wherein nodes are
accounts and edges are transactions. Section 4 describes the new proposal of the Modiﬁed Inverse
Herﬁndahl-Hirschman Index and Flow Index. Section 5 is devoted to studying the global structure of
the XRP network, similar to bow-tie/walnut decomposition, using the Flow Index. Section 6 oﬀers

discussion and conclusion.

2. Data and its Basic Statistics

The ledger data we analyze are for 2,463 days of 1/2/2013–9/30/2019. The ﬁrst 32,570 ledgers

were lost because of “a mishap in 2012” [7].

2.1 Data Selection

From this data set, we extract data with the following criteria.

(1) The ledger contains transactions between 1,525 currencies and crypto-assets. Most of these are
from XRP to XRP; however, some of them are from XRP to others, others to XRP, and others
to others. We provide a yearly breakdown for those with XRP–XRP, and the rest is provided in
Fig.1. We use XRP–XRP transactions only.

(2) The data set contains “partial payments” [8], wherein the actual transferred amount is diﬀerent
from the transaction amount because of the payment of transfer fees. In reality, they are rare:
0.018% of all of the XRP–XRP transactions, with the minimum of 0% in 2013 and a maximum
of 0.041% in 2019. The distribution of “Amount” and “Delivered amount” and the delivered
amount is provided in Fig. 2, wherein we observe some patterns of quantization of the delivered
amount and the proportionality between the amount and the delivered amount. We drop these
“partial payment” transactions from the following analysis.

After ﬁltering, we arrive at the data of the sizes listed in Table II.

2.2 Data Distributions

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the annual XRP transaction is plotted in Fig. 3,
1. The data for XRP > 105 ﬁt are appropriate to
wherein the dashed straight line has a gradient of =
this line, except for the ﬁrst year of 2013. This means that the XRP distribution has a power-decaying
2 in the Probability Distribution Function (eps). The absolute value
fat tail, XRP−
of this exponent of CDF tail is called the “Pareto index.”. The current Pareto index 1 is known to be a
phase transition point between an “Oligopoly” phase and a “Pseudo Equality” phase [9, 10]: In case
the fat tail is thinner and the Pareto index is larger than 1, the share of those with higher ranks (top,
largest, second largest, and so forth) have zero shares when an inﬁnite number of entries are present.

Fig. 2. Distribution of “Amount” and “Delivered amount” of the XRP–XRP transactions whose “Amount”
is not equal to “Delivered Amount.” The dashed diagonal has a gradient equal to one wherein the amount is
equal to the delivered amount.

In contrast, the top-ranking ones have ﬁnite shares, even when an inﬁnite number of entries exists.

The top 10 transactions (in amount) are listed in Table III. As shown in Table II, the total traded
1012 XRP. Therefore, the top two transactions in this table occupy 17% of all

45 million transactions, which is indeed a large share.

This criticality of the Pareto index being equal to one is most easily understood when referring to
the case of the size of ﬁrms in a country. Empirical analysis of ﬁrms in developed countries (such as
Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) showed that the ﬁrm size (number of employees,
amount of sales, or income) distribution has a Pareto index very close to one through many years. This
is in contrast to the distribution of personal income whose Pareto index varies around 2 (say, 1.5–2.5),
depending on the economic situation of the year. For ﬁrms, business competition drives the Pareto
index downward (fatter tail), as big ﬁrms attempt to dominate the market. In contrast, various political
pressures and measures by the central bank and the ministries against monopoly and oligopoly are
active. The current author argued that the balancing critical point is at a Pareto index equal to one [9].
However, a big diﬀerence between this argument on ﬁrm size and the current XRP transaction exists.

The former is “stock,” while the latter (the transaction amount we analyze) is “ﬂow.” Moreover, the
XRP world is free from central governing organization and there is no measure against monopoly and
oligopoly. Thus, the reason behind the current ﬁnding remains a mystery for the moment.

2.3 Time Series

Fig. 4 shows the daily amount of transactions. Fig. 5 shows the daily number of users (blue,
orange, and green lines show number of sources, destinations, and either sources or destinations,
respectively). We observe that both the amount and number of users are highly volatile and that most
users trade both as a source and destination.

The left panel of Fig. 6 shows the details of the daily number of transactions in 2018, wherein
Sundays (in UTC) are shown with a vertical dashed line. The reduction of transactions on Saturdays
and Sundays is visible to the naked eye. This indicates that most of the nodes are operated by humans.
(Although the time is in UTC and the data cover the entire world, the Saturdays and Sundays in UTC

are approximately weekends in most economically active regions, as the Paciﬁc Standard time (PST)
in the United States is UTC-7, and Japan Standard Time (JST) is UTC+9.) It is clear that the absolute
values of the Fourier components in the right panel present a clear peak at a period of seven days.
The daily number of users also shows reduction on weekends. However, the daily total amount of
transactions does not show a clear periodicity. This may be because of its high volatility. This weekly
periodicity is weaker in other years. A similar behavior was found in the analysis of the volume and

2.4 Correlation

There is a correlation that obeys an interesting phenomenological law. Fig. 7 shows the correlation
between daily number of users and daily total amount of transactions, in which diﬀerent colors show
diﬀerent years. The dashed line has gradient = 1.5, which means that

[Amount]

∝

[Number of users]1.5.

(1)

We observe yearly development toward large numbers of users and a larger amount of transactions
roughly along this line. A close examination of the annual data reveals that the distribution split into
a group above and another below this line in 2013 and 2014, respectively; however, this converges in
later years. This power law is curious, calling for the modeling of agents in this XRP world: Since
Eq.(1) means

[Amount per user]

[Number of users]0.5,

∝

(2)

This means an interesting characteristic of the herding behavior in XRP trade: in a day of high activity
with a number of users larger than usual, the amount of average transactions increases. For example,
if the number of users becomes 10 times as much, the amount of average transactions becomes √10
3.2 times as much.

≃

Other correlations between the number of destinations, number of sources, and number of trans-
actions show no such behavior. All three correlations follow linear proportionality (power exponents
are close to one).

3. XRP Network

Let us examine the network(s) they form, where nodes are accounts, and edges are transactions.
The CDFs of in-degree and out-degree are plotted in Fig. 8. We observe that, except for 2015–
2017, it also has a fat tail with Pareto index 1. Again, this is an interesting ﬁnding, awaiting deeper
insight and/or modelling.

3.1 Nodes with Large Transaction History

As noted above, the transactions cover a vast range of 10−

1011
XRP (Fig. 3). As dealing with them all is unproductive, we introduce a threshold for their biggest

once during the entire period (2013–2019). The network sizes they form are listed in Table IV, and
the corresponding networks are visualized in Fig. 9. In denoting the node, we use the set of 1,136

XRP as “huge nodes.”) For example, “bn0001” is the ﬁrst node in a set of big nodes.

3.2 Some Notable Big Nodes

Some of the nodes that made these huge transactions have a rather notable transaction history,

some of which are listed below.
Pair Nodes This is a pair of nodes, among which a large amount of XRP was transferred, with
no other notable activity. An example of this type of node is (bn0347, bn0864) at the top two in
1011 XRP was transferred from the former to the latter. The former

had no other activity, while the latter had numerous transactions considered to be negligible
amounts compared to these transactions. Their transaction histories are provided in Fig. 10,
where blue dots present the day and amount of transactions as destination (receival of XRP),
red dots show those of transactions as source, and green lines show balance, assuming it is zero
initially.

×

Bridge Nodes This node receives a large amount of XRP and sends it to another node, with no
other notable activity. The node bn530, the third in Table III, is an example of this case, whose
transaction history is plotted in Fig. 11.
In characterizing these nodes considering the amount and frequency of transactions, noting that
some nodes make these huge transactions and many transactions of small amounts is important. A
good example is the node bn0846 in Fig. 10: This node made several transactions of small amounts
as both a destination and source. However, they are negligible compared to the two large transactions
1011 XRP, which are the only signiﬁcant transactions in characterizing
on the same day, totaling 2.0
the transaction behavior of this node. As made clear from this example, a simple count of the number
of transactions (as a source or destination) or total number of transactions cannot be considered a
good measure of its activity. What counts is the number of “signiﬁcant” (in the amount) transactions

number of transactions in each of the directions.

4. Flow Index

4.1 Herﬁndahl-Hirschman Index

The Herﬁndahl-Hirschman Index [11] (hereafter abbreviated to “HH Index,””) is used in several
data analysis areas to quantify how numbers are distributed to components in a list. Consider a list ℓ
of N non-negative numbers, whose total number is equal to 1:

(3)

(One might think of this list as a list of shares: For example, the ﬁrst entry ℓ1 is the share of the 1st
ﬁrm in the sales of a certain good, ℓ2 share of the second ﬁrm, and so on.) Its HH Index H(ℓ) is

(6)

As presented here, the HH Index H(ℓ) is a measure of the concentration of the values in ℓ: If it is
concentrated to just one component, H(ℓ) = 1. If it is less concentrated, the smaller H(ℓ) is.

The inverse HH Index, 1/H(ℓ), may be used as a measure of the eﬀective number of entries, as
1/H(ℓ) = m in the latter case (6). However, it has one undesirable property. In the next subsection,
we describe the method and propose a modiﬁcation for overcoming it.

4.2 Modiﬁed Inverse Herﬁndahl-Hirschman Index

Let us examine the behavior of the inverse HH Index for a generalization of (6).

(8)

The inverse is plotted in Fig. 12 as a function of m + r (
x). As shown here,1/H(ℓ(r)) = m at integer
values of x = m (r = 0), as noted above. However, it ﬂattens as r
1, and the derivative with
respect to x is discontinuous at x = m. Essentially, the inverse HH Index is much less sensitive to
the reduction in the distribution of numbers (r decreases starting at r = 1 for ﬁxed m
1) than its
expansion (r increases starting at r = 0 for a ﬁxed m). It also deviates in certain ways from the dashed
diagonal line f (x) = x, while having a measure closer to this line is desirable.

Because of this property, one may choose n to be a large number for analysis. In the following, we
use n = 20 because the diﬀerence observed in the right panel of Fig. 13 is at most

1.4%.

to bottom (green). Right: Mn(ℓ(r))/x.

4.3 Flow Index

The modiﬁed inverse HH Index deﬁned above is useful for quantifying a node’s transaction his-
tory. Let us denote the time series of the daily outﬂow by fout and the daily inﬂow by fin for this
discussion. All the components of fout and fin are positive. Their “normalized” (in the sense that the
total of all components is equal to 1, as in Eq.(3)) versions are denoted ¯fout and ¯fin. In a case with no
ﬂow, for example, fout =

(an empty set), we deﬁne ¯fout =

and Mn( ¯fout) = 0, and so on.

Here we are dealing with the ﬂows aggregated daily. Alternatively, one may deal with tick data
of the ﬂows. The diﬀerence is that if a node makes several large transactions within a short period
of time, treating them as one transaction is most appropriate. Daily aggregation takes care of them

{}

{}

11

unless several transactions are made in a time window that includes 0:00 UTC. For this reason, the
daily aggregation is chosen in this study.

Take the node bn0864 shown in the right panel of Fig. 10. This node ﬁts the case discussed above:
1011 XRP each within 50 s of time were made. Daily aggregation treats them
two transactions of 1.0
1011 XRP transaction. It also included lots of small income over 17 days. Therefore, its
as one 2.0
eﬀective inﬂow history is best summarized to be on “(very close to) just one occasion.” Its modiﬁed
inverse HH Index is, in fact, M20( ¯fin) = 1.00005, quantifying this fact.

×

×

This is not the end of the story. This node had payment over two days (two red dots in the right
panel of Fig. 10) and its modiﬁed inverse HH Index for the outﬂow is M20( ¯fout) = 1.20427. However,
the amount of outﬂow was negligible compared to the inﬂow. We need to discount the outﬂow relative
to the inﬂow for this node.

To do so for all nodes, we introduce the following quantity, the Flow Index:

A =

M20( ¯fin)

Max( fin)
Max( fin, fout)

, M20( ¯fout)

Max( fout)
Max( fin, fout) !

.

(13)

Max( fin) is the maximum of the components of the outﬂow, and Max( fin, fout) denotes the maximum
of the components of the joined set of inﬂows and outﬂows.

For node bn0864, we obtain

A = (1.0005, 5.8955

10−

10),

×

(14)

a very satisfactory result.

One may think of modifying the above by using the total volume of ﬂows instead of maximum

values. However, that does not work. This can be further explored by our readers.

5. Global Structure of the XRP Network

The left panel of Fig. 14 is a scatter plot of 1,136 big nodes (green, threshold = 107 XRP) and
1,176 huge nodes (blue, above threshold = 109 XRP) (see Table IV) on the Flow Index plane. We
observe that the nodes are distributed somewhat widely on the lower-left part of the Flow Index
plane. This implies a tendency of nodes with a small number of eﬀective transactions (as counted
by the Flow Index) tend to trade as destination and as origin unevenly. In contrast, those with a
higher number of transactions are located close to the diagonal, meaning that they tend to trade as
destinations and origins evenly. This tendency is true for both big nodes and huge nodes.

The right panel of Fig. 14 shows the details of the left panel. We observe the existence of nodes
that mostly participate in one mode. Motivated by this type of distribution, we classify the nodes
0.5 (red rectangle) as “OUT” components, as they are mostly on the destination side. This
with A1 ≤
means they are at the ﬁnal goal of XRP when viewed as part of the whole network. We found 193
0.5 (purple rectangle) as “IN” components; there
nodes. Similarly, we classify the nodes with A2 ≤
are 52 of them.

Using this criteria, we can draw bow-tie/walnut-like structures [12], as shown in Fig. 15.
This characterizes the global structure of the XRP network, which forms the basis for understand-

ing the dynamics and development of this complex structure.

6. Concluding Remarks

In this study, we presented an analysis of XRP transaction records from ledger data.
These data are huge and complex: In addition to the number of transactions, The distribution
of traded amount, frequency of transactions, and so on cover huge ranges, some of which cover 18
6 to 1011 XRP). A notable empirical ﬁnding includes the power distribution
orders of magnitude (10−
of several quantities with a Pareto exponent close to one, and a power-law correlation between the
daily number of transactions and the daily amount of transactions. The former remains a puzzle:
While Pareto index equal to one is known to be the beginning of the monopoly/oligopoly phase, we
have a reasonable explanation behind it only for stock quantities like number of employees at ﬁrms.
The current transaction amount between nodes is a ﬂow.. The latter, the power-law correlation, may
be explained in terms of “herding behavior.” Proper modelling with the use of deeper analysis of
the current data should lead to the explanation of this correlation. These subjects are worth more
extensive exploration in the future.

The XRP network, a directive network with nodes as transaction accounts and edges as transac-
tions, is another main subject of this research. To concentrate on the central structure of this network,
we placed a threshold for the maximum amount of each node. We selected nodes that made trans-
107 XRP at least once and called them big nodes. To examine transaction
actions of more than
frequency while considering the huge range of transaction amount each nodes make, we deﬁned a
new index called “Flow Index,” borrowing and extending the idea of the Herﬁndahl-Hirschman In-
dex. We further introduced classiﬁcation of nodes using the Flow Index and arrived at a view of the
entire network as a bowtie/walnut-like.

We believe this work establishes a foundation for not only the XRP network but also other dy-
namic networks of transactions. Further research on this network should reveal details of the activities
and clariﬁcation of each node’s characteristics on the structure of the bow-tie/walnut-like decompo-
sitions.
Noteadded inproof:

Toward the end of writing this manuscript, the author learned of a new paper by Fujiwara and
Islam [13], where they examined the Bitcoin network formed by “regular users.” This approach is
complementary to our current analysis. While the latter chooses to select users based on the number
of transactions, the former analyzes the frequency of transactions. The current author believes that a
new approach based on both ways of thinking and picking up good features from both is waiting for
us in the near future.
