Abstract 

Automated  Market  Makers  (‚ÄúAMMs‚Äù)  are  autonomous  smart  contracts  deployed  on  a 

blockchain that make markets between different assets that live on that chain. In this paper 

we  are  examining  a  specific  class  of  AMMs  called  Constant  Function  Market  Makers 

(‚ÄúCFMMs‚Äù) whose trading profile (ignoring fees) is determined by their bonding curve, eg 

ùëò = ùë• ‚àó ùë¶. This class of AMM suffers from what is commonly referred to as Impermanent 

Loss  (‚ÄúIL‚Äù),  which  we  have  previously  identified  as  the  Gamma  component  of  the 

associated  self-financing trading  strategy and  which  is the risk that  LP  providers  wager 

against potential fee earnings. 

The recent Uniswap v3 release has popularized the concept of leveraged liquidity provision 

- wherein the trading range in which liquidity is provided is reduced and achieves a higher 

degree  of  capital  efficiency  through  elimination  of  unused  collateral.  This  leverage 

increases  the  fees  earned,  but  it  also  increases  the  risk  taken,  ie  the  IL.  Fee  levels  on 

Uniswap v3 are well publicized so, in this paper, we focus on calculating the IL. 

We found that for the 17 pools we analyzed ‚Äì covering 43% of TVL and chosen by size, 

composite tokens and data availability ‚Äì total fees earned since inception until the cut-off 

date was $199.3m. We also found that the total IL suffered by LPs during this period was 

$260.1m, meaning that in aggregate those LPs would have been better off by $60.8m had 

they simply HODLd. 

We  then  try  to  identify  which  class  of  users,  if  any,  does  better  than  others.  Our  first 

hypothesis  was  that  active  users  who  adjust  their  positions  more  frequently  would 

outperform those that don‚Äôt, but we could find no statistically meaningful evidence for that. 

We then looked at the time frame during which the position was active. We found that, 

with the exception of flash LPs who provided liquidity intra-block, all time segments lost. 

We did however note a trend that longer term LPs, whilst not making money after IL, did 

better than short term LPs: the IL for LP positions >1 month was 1.1x fees whilst, this for 

up to a day was 1.8x fees.We identified a number of areas for further research, notably, 

understanding whether there are medium-term LP strategies that consistently outperform 

HODLing, or whether the best performing strategy is simply related to ‚Äútime in the market 

as opposed to timing the market‚Äù as the proverb goes.

Introduction 

Uniswap released its version 3 in March 2021, which popularized and industrialized the 

concept of leveraged or concentrated liquidity. Uniswap V3 is a clever reengineering of the 

leveraged liquidity concept, but it is not the seminal example; its predecessors include the 

stableswap invariant introduced by Curve Finance v1 and the amplified liquidity of Bancor 

v2.0. Impermanent loss (‚ÄúIL‚Äù) in a concentrated liquidity framework is complex as it must 

contend with the leverage introduced, while also accounting for the IL outside of the range, 

which does not exist for traditional AMMs. 

In this paper we extend the definition of IL to leveraged market makers, introducing the 

concepts  of  minimal  IL  and  actual  IL,  and  derive  the  relevant  formulas  for  their 

computation. We then apply those concepts and formulas to Uniswap V3 where we analyze 

pools with uncorrelated pairs (eg stable coin pairs have been excluded) and a TVL greater 

than USD 10m, which at the time of this study accounted for roughly 43% of all TVL on 

Uniswap  V3.  The  pools  were  chosen  based  first  on  TVL  size  and  then  excluded  if  the 

required external price data was unavailable. 

Our core finding is that overall, and for almost all pools, both the minimal and actual IL 

surpass the fees earned during this period. In other words, the average liquidity provider 

(‚ÄúLP‚Äù)  in  the  Uniswap  v3  ecosystem  has  been  financially  harmed  by  their  choice  of 

activities and would have been more profitable simply holding their assets ("HODLing‚Äù). 

Importantly, this conclusion appears broadly applicable; we have collected evidence that 

suggests  both  inexperienced  retail  users  and  sophisticated  professionals  experience  a 

comparable struggle to turn a profit under this model, with the exception of ‚Äúflash LPs‚Äù 

(aka just-in-time or ‚ÄúJIT‚Äù liquidity providers) who provide liquidity for a single block, to 

absorb  fees  from  upcoming  trades,  then  instantly  remove  their  position.  This  cohort 

generated a modest $1.27m in fees while incurring zero IL. 

Automated  market  makers  (‚ÄúAMMs‚Äù)  ‚Äì  specifically  constant-product  AMMs  have 

experienced exceptional growth in total value locked (‚ÄúTVL‚Äù) and fee income since their 

introduction.  The  major  issue  with  providing  liquidity  in  AMMs  is  exposure  to 

Impermanent Loss, which we will discuss in more detail in the next section. Several new 

AMM  designs  have  appeared  to  address  this  critical  pain  point;  Balancer1  attempts  to 

curtail IL with multi-asset pools and variable weights, Curve2 has augmented the constant 

product  function  and  primarily  focusses  its  activities  on  stable  assets  to  restrict  IL, 

Thorchain3 uses a variable fee structure, and Bancor v2.14,5 provides IL insurance at the 

protocol level.

Uniswap v2 was the most successful of all AMMs as far as volume and fees are concerned. 

Uniswap v3 was introduced with  the publication6 of its whitepaper in March  2021, and 

launched in May 2021 with a strong focus on ‚Äúleveraged‚Äù or ‚Äúconcentrated‚Äù liquidity. The 

new  model  has  attracted  significant  attention  from  both  retail  and  professional  users. 

Notably,  Uniswap  v3  has  provided  fertile  ground  for  the  creation  of  secondary  DeFi 

protocols that seek to establish a reliable source of revenue generation from new strategies 

inspired by the leveraged liquidity paradigm. 

Uniswap  v3‚Äôs  performance  has  been  impressive  since  launch.  Across  analyzed  pools,  

Uniswap generated over $108.5b in trading volume and a total of $199.3m in fee income 

from May 5th 2021 to September 20th 2021. However, what is often forgotten is that AMM 

fees do not come for free ‚Äì they are a compensation for the risk, in particular the IL risk ‚Äì 

that liquidity providers (‚ÄúLPs‚Äù) are taking. While Uniswap V3 generated $199.3m in fees, 

during the same period the analyzed pools  incurred, according to  our calculations,  over 

$260.1m in impermanent loss, leaving half (49.5 %) of liquidity providers with negative 

returns. To the best of our knowledge there has, to date, been no systematic study of the IL 

suffered by Uniswap v3 LPs, which is the focus of our work here. 

This paper is divided into the following sections.  

After this introduction we review the concept of AMMs and CFMMs, with a special focus 

on IL.    We  then  extend  the theoretical  framework to  the type  of  levered  /  concentrated 

AMM that Uniswap v3 represents. In Section IV,  we provide some descriptive global and 

pool level statistics, allowing us to better understand the shape of the system. 

Sections V and VI are the core sections of this paper: we first analyze the IL across the 

pools and compare it with the fee levels the pools offer to understand whether LPs derive 

economic benefit from their activity. In the last section (VI), we look at ROIs and other 

performance results including the percentage of LPs making  vs. losing money and their 

mean returns.

Review and Methodology 

Automated market makers 

In May 2021, Uniswap launched their latest protocol version, Uniswap v3 which heavily 

emphasizes  the  concept  of  concentrated  liquidity.  Concentrated  liquidity  itself  is  not 

entirely new, but Uniswap v3 pushed the envelope a little further. In Uniswap v3, for each 

of  the  pools,  the  trading  area  is  segmented  into  specific  price  buckets  and  liquidity 

providers can freely choose the range of buckets within which they want their liquidity to 

be active. Therefore, Uniswap v3 can achieve significantly lower slippage at the same level 

of liquidity provided and, on the not unreasonable assumption that trading volume follows 

slippage, also achieve a significant higher level of fees per unit of liquidity provided. 

Those  higher  fees  however  do  not  come  for  free,  and  this  is  often  ignored:  leveraging 

liquidity not only amplifies the returns, but also the risks associated with those returns. In 

this case, the trade-off is that for increased fee levels, the liquidity providers must also be 

exposed to increased levels of IL. The purpose of this work is to dive into this subject and 

to analyze the IL that liquidity providers on Uv3 suffer. 

Impermanent Loss in a traditional AMM 

Before we dive into the analysis of IL, we need to point out that this terminology is very 

unfortunate:  the  so-called  ‚Äúimpermanent‚Äù  loss  is  often  anything  but  impermanent, 

especially in relation to coins that rapidly increase in value (‚Äúmoon‚Äù, using the common 

vernacular). An investment that would have appreciated 50x if held outside of an AMM is 

handicapped to a mere 10x if the coins are used for liquidity provision at an AMM. The 

fact that this IL would be reversed if ever the coin in question returns to its original value 

is of little comfort to the ‚Äúunlucky‚Äù liquidity provider who was probably also a believer in 

that coin. 

This is a convenient segue into our definition of IL, which we want to formally define as: 

Impermanent Loss is the difference between the value of the current fee adjusted 

liquidity position  in an  AMM,  and  the  HODL  value  of  the  position that  was 

originally contributed. 

The reason the current position needs to be adjusted is that AMM positions suffer gas costs 

and earn fees, and the impact of those needs to be excluded if we are to discriminate the 

IL. Also, we want to point out at this stage that this definition becomes more involved in 

Uv3 as  the reference  HODL  position is not easy to  identify in the  presence  of multiple 

liquidity transactions. 

5 

We have discussed the topic of IL, and its relation to option pricing, in a previous paper5, 

and we refer the reader to this paper for a more in-depth discussion. Here we only want to 

recall the key results. 

A traditional AMM ‚Äì also referred to as constant product AMM ‚Äì relies on the following 

characteristic curve 

ùëò = ùëö ‚ãÖ ùëõ 

where ùëò is the pool constant, and n and ùëö are the pool constituents, measured in their own 

numeraire. In other word, if a pool contains 2 ETH and $2,000 then the constant is ùëò = 2 ‚àó

2,000 = 4,000. The AMM then offers any  trade  that  maintains the pool  constant,  well, 

constant; in other words, and ignoring fees, the AMM is indifferent holding 2 ETH and 

$2,000 USD, or 1 ETH and $4,000, or 8 ETH and $500 and will engage into any trade that 

leaves it in one of those end states. It is worth mentioning that if k is constant so is any 

function ùëì(ùëò). Often it is preferred using ùëò = ‚àöùëö ‚ãÖ ùëõ instead of the above, but as far as the 

AMM is concerned those two are the same. 

Arguably the most important insight with respect to traditional AMMs is the following. 

In  a  traditional  AMM,  the aggregate  dollar  value  of  the  two  assets in  a fully 

arbitraged AMM is always equal. 

We are referring to the dollar value in the statement above, but of course if the value in 

dollar is equal so is the value in Euro, in ETH or in any other numeraire chosen. A key 

corollary to this ‚Äì and the ultimate source of the IL ‚Äì is the following statement: 

An AMM always sells the outperforming asset and buys the underperforming 

asset. 

It is easy to see that this leads to a loss against HODL: the initial pool contribution was 

equal in value. Then the pool keeps selling the outperforming asset as it goes up. In other 

words, during a rally, instead of HODLing, the pool sells the outperforming asset into the 

rally, meaning it can no longer profit from subsequent price increases. That, in a nutshell, 

is the source of IL. 

If  you  are  familiar  with  option  pricing  you  might  recognize  this  as  a  positive  Gamma 

strategy. In a range trading market this strategy allows you to make money by buying low 

(you buy when an asset underperforms) and selling high (you sell when it outperforms), 

and you should therefore earn the option premium ‚ÄúTheta‚Äù on your ‚ÄúGamma‚Äù. It turns out 

however that here this is not the case, and the reason is that AMMs are not active traders 

6 

but instead rely on arbitrageurs. Ignoring fees, a standard AMM offers an arbitrageur to 

execute the trade at the mid-point (geometric average) of the pool-implied price before and 

after the trade. 

It is worth playing this through to understand the nature of IL: we assume that the pool-

implied price is currently at 100, and the price moves to 110. In this case the pool offers to 

trade at ‚àö100 √ó 110 ‚àº 104.8, leaving a profit of 5.2 for the arbitrageur. If market then 

goes back to 100, the pool again allows to trade at ‚àö110 √ó 100 ‚àº 104.8, but this time in 

the  other  direction.  In  other  words:  the  pool  has  traded  twice  at  104.8,  in  opposite 

directions, and is therefore exactly where it started. This is the reason why this is referred 

to  as  ‚Äúimpermanent‚Äù  loss  ‚Äì  it  disappears  when  markets  return  to  their  initial  levels. 

However, the pool leaked significant value: it sold at 104.8 when it could have sold at 110, 

and it bought at 104.8 when it could have bought at 100. Overall, the pool could have made 

10 from this move but, ignoring fees, it paid those 10 to the arbitrageur.  

In order to calculate IL, it is easiest to place ourselves in the numeraire on one of the assets 

‚Äì say USDX for an ETHUSDX pool. We define ùë•(cid:3047) as the exchange ratio of the two assets, 

ie the ratio between the two prices. In the case of ETHUSDX and USDX as numeraire is 

simply the ETH price expressed in USDX. We also normalize it to ùë•(cid:2868) = 1, so technically 

our ùë•(cid:3047) is the change in the price ratio if we are being precise. In this case the value of the 

HODL portfolio that invests 1 unit of the numeraire into each of the assets is 

ùêªùëÇùê∑ùêø(ùë•) = 1 + ùë• 

Again, to be precise, we should point out that those numbers are dimensionless and need 

to be multiplied with the initial portfolio notional for scale. It is a well-known result5 that 

the value of the AMM portfolio in the above case is 

ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(ùë•) = 2‚àöùë• 

For the IL this gives us 

ùêºùêø(cid:3047) =

ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(cid:3047) ‚àí ùêªùëÇùê∑ùêø(cid:3047)
ùêªùëÇùê∑ùêø(cid:2868)

=

1
2

(cid:3435)2(cid:3493)ùë•(cid:3047) ‚àí ùë•(cid:3047) ‚àí 1(cid:3439) 

As discussed above, this number is dimensionless ‚Äì it is simply a percentage applied to the 

original portfolio notional. 

7 

The IL on the upside is unlimited whilst on the downside it seems limited, but this is a 

consequence of choosing a numeraire. This is easiest to see with an example: if the pool is 

ETHUSD and ETH appreciates 100√ó, then in USD terms the pool goes 10x while HODL 

goes  50√ó  (only  1/2  the  HODL  funds  are  in  ETH).  The  IL  is  therefore  40√ó  the  initial 

investment,  and  we  see  that  ultimately  IL  measured  in  USD  is  not  limited  in  the  ETH 

upside. On the ETH downside however, we will never be able to lose more than the initial 

investment,  so  the  maximum  IL  on  the  ETH  downside,  measured  in  USDX  is  100%. 

However, measured in ETH this loss is substantial as ETH goes to zero. We can just flip 

around that if we measure everything in ETH then the ETH downside (aka ‚ÄúUSD mooning‚Äù) 

has unlimited IL if measured in ETH. 

Impermanent loss in Uniswap v3 

Introduction 

The Uniswap v3 formulas are somewhat complex. We have made an effort to organize the 

theory in such a way as to demonstrate that, in fact, the underlying principle is relatively 

familiar. 

The key insight by the Uniswap developers is  that we  can limit  the trading range of  an 

AMM by introducing a hard stop. Suppose the initial exchange ratio ùë• was 100, and we 

simply force the AMM to stop trading if x is outside the range 80 ‚Ä¶ 120. We know that at 

80 (20% down) the IL is 

(cid:2869)
(cid:2870)

(1 + 0.8 ‚àí ‚àö0.8) ‚àº 0.56%, and on the upside the IL is 

(cid:2869)
(cid:2870)

(1 +

1.2 ‚àí ‚àö1.2) ‚àº 0.46%. We also know that anywhere in the range, and therefore also at the 

8 

 
boundaries, the dollar value in each of the constituent assets is the same. So, on the lower 

end, there are 80 units of the risk asset for each unit of numeraire, and at the upper end 

there are 120. We also know that below 80 and above 120 the AMM simply stops trading, 

so from this point onwards the portfolio composition (but not its value!) remains the same 

regardless of price changes. 

Looking at this from a traditional AMM lens this limits our IL to about 0.5%. We however 

now have a positional mismatch, and as we will see below this is the single biggest problem 

to define a meaningful and intuitive IL measure for range-80 ‚Ä¶ 120 AMMs. The issue is 

simple: we have seen that between 80‚Ä¶120 our IL was well inside 0.6%. So far so good, 

but what about outside this range? Our initial portfolio had 100 units of the numeraire asset 

for each unit of the risk asset. Below the lower bound the portfolio is static, but it is static 

at 80 units of numeraire per risk asset. In other words: the AMM is more exposed to the 

risk  asset  than  our  HODL  portfolio  (the  AMM  buys  low,  sells  high)  and  therefore  will 

suffer more if the risk asset falls further. 

This directional loss is a real loss, but it is structurally different from the IL we‚Äôre used to 

looking at so we are making an important distinction here: 

Minimum IL. The minimum IL is the IL that is incurred while the asset was in range; 

this is not avoidable even by the most sophisticated traders ‚Äì as long as they want to earn 

fees, that is the risk they are facing. 

Out-of-range IL. The out-of-range IL is the IL incurred when the asset was outside the 

range; it is simply the difference in performance between the initial HODL position, and 

the frozen position at the end  of  the range  that  is  overweight in the  underperforming 

asset. Out of range IL can be avoided without fee loss by withdrawing the position after 

it goes out of range and rebalancing the portfolio into the initial HODL composition ‚Äì or 

into any directional position that the LP prefers at this stage 

Actual IL. The actual IL is the sum of the minimum IL and the out-of-range IL 

We considered the actual IL as the most important IL in our analysis because we wanted 

to look at how real LPs fare on Uniswap v3. This means we need to include all incurred 

losses, even if they would have been avoidable by a more sophisticated investor who has 

the wherewithal to rebalance their position if it ever goes out of range.  

9 

So far, we have used the restriction of the trading range to 80‚Ä¶120 to derisk our traditional 

AMM. However, there is a second angle to this: because we limited the trading range there 

is a limit to how far the amount of constituent assets in the pool can fall. On the downside 

the AMM buys the risk asset and sells the numeraire asset, therefore the absolute minimum 

holdings of numeraire asset are in our case at an exchange ratio of 80. We know the value 

of the portfolio at 80, it is 200‚àö0.8, and we know that 50% of this is in the numeraire. In 

other words, the minimum numeraire holdings in the 80‚Ä¶120 AMM are 100‚àö0.8 ‚àº 89. 

Instead of contributing $100 worth of the numeraire we can contribute $11 because this is 

the maximum we can ever lose. 

This is the basic principle behind a levered AMM: we contributed only 11 units 

of the numeraire asset, but our AMM behaves as if it had 100 units worth  of 

liquidity. The fact that we start at 80 gives us about 9x leverage on the amount 

of numeraire asset contributed. 

On the upside the calculation is similar, we just have to take into account that we now have 

numeraire effects. The value of the AMM portfolio at 120 is 200‚àö1.2 and again half of it 

is in the numeraire, so we have 100‚àö1.2 ‚àº 109.5 units of numeraire invested in the risk 

asset. We also know that, at the boundary, 1 unit of the risk asset is worth 120, so in units 

of the risk asset our holding are  

(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2877).(cid:2873)
(cid:2869)(cid:2870)(cid:2868)

= 0.91. In other words, instead of starting with 1 unit 

of the risk asset we can start with 0.09 units of the risk asset, yielding 11x leverage. 

Note that the upside and downside leverage numbers are not the same, and also the value 

of the assets contributed is no longer the same either: we need 11 units of the numeraire, 

and 0.09 assets of the risk asset which, at 100, corresponds to a value of 9. This is because 

our range is asymmetric when looked at it through a multiplicative lens. We can see this 

effect even more if we'd used a clearly asymmetric range like say 80‚Ä¶140. In this case 

what happens at the lower limit remains unchanged, but at the upper limit we have 

(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2868)‚àö(cid:2869).(cid:2872)
(cid:2869)(cid:2872)(cid:2868)

‚àº

0.85. In this case we still need 11 units of the numeraire but, because of the wider range at 

the upside, we need 15 numeraire units worth of the risk asset at the outset. Contrary, if we 

restrict our upside to 110 we get 

(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2868)‚àö(cid:2869).(cid:2869)
(cid:2869)(cid:2869)(cid:2868)

‚àº 0.95, so we only need to use 5 units worth of 

the risk asset. 

Now the fact that we need to use less collateral is advantageous from one point of view. If 

we assumed that there is a limit to the amount of collateral we can contribute, a levered 

AMM allows us to run a bigger virtual pool with lower slippage, and therefore hopefully 

attract  more  trading  and  therefore  earn  more  fees.  The  downside  however  is  that  this 

10 

magnification also magnifies the IL. To give rough numbers for the 80 ‚Ä¶ 120 range, the 

initial IL was 0.5% of the unlevered pool notional. Our maximum leverage in this range is 

about 10√ó, and this means our max IL suddenly increases by the same factor, to 5%. For 

more pronounced asymmetric ranges we need to distinguish between upside and downside 

IL. 

Uniswap v3 portfolio value and composition 

The value of a Uniswap v3 AMM portfolio is more complex, and for example Lambert7 

has a good overview of how to arrive at it. Using a slightly different notation to Lambert 

we find that the portfolio value ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(ùë•) of a Uniswap v3 position is 

ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(ùë•) = ùëõ(cid:2868) ‚ãÖ ùë•  ‚àÄùë• < ùë•(cid:2868) 

ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(ùë•) = ùëõ(cid:2868) ‚ãÖ (cid:4678)(cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)ùë•(cid:2869) ‚ãÖ

‚àöùë• ‚àí (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)
‚àöùë•(cid:2869) ‚àí (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)

+ (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)ùë• ‚ãÖ

‚àöùë•(cid:2869) ‚àí ‚àöùë•
‚àöùë•(cid:2869) ‚àí (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)

(cid:4679)    ‚àÄùë•(cid:2868) < ùë• < ùë•(cid:2869) 

ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(ùë•) = ùëõ(cid:2868) ‚ãÖ (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)ùë•(cid:2869)   ‚àÄùë• > ùë•(cid:2869) 

Here ùë• is as usual the price ratio of the two assets in the pool, ùë•(cid:2868) and ùë•(cid:2869) are the lower and 

upper  bounds  of  the  range  where  liquidity  is  provided,  and  ùëõ(cid:2868)  is  an  overall  portfolio 

notional factor. We have plotted this function for 3 different ranges below, with the lower 

bound of the range being x=70, 80, 90 respectively, and the upper bound chosen so that the 

range is symmetric around x=100 in multiplicative terms. 

11 

Value Uniswap v3 portfolio at different ranges 

We see that for ùë• < ùë•(cid:2868) the chart is linear in ùë•, meaning that the position is entirely vested 

in the risk asset as we would expect it to be at the risk-asset downside. For ùë• > ùë•(cid:2869) the curve 

is constant, meaning that the position  is  entirely  vested in  the numeraire  asset, again as 

we‚Äôd expect at the risk-asset upside. 

The normalization of the value function is such that at the risk-asset downside, exactly 1 

unit of the risk asset is held. On the upside this will be converted into the numeraire at the 

(geometric) average price of the range which is ùë•‚Äæ = (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)ùë•(cid:2869). That conversion ratio is to be 

expected: we know that when a traditional AMM adjusts from ùë• = ùë•(cid:2868) to ùë• = ùë•(cid:2869) then it 

does so at an exchange ratio of  ùë•‚Äæ = (cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868)ùë•(cid:2869), and Uniswap v3 behaves between ùë•(cid:2868) ‚Ä¶ ùë•(cid:2869), 

like a traditional AMM, so its behavior has to be consistent with that. 

Note  that  we  can  find  the  ùê¥ùëÄùëÄ(ùë•) = 2‚àöùë•  of  a traditional  AMM  by  first  setting  ùëõ(cid:2868) =

1/(cid:3493)ùë•(cid:2868).  This  is  just  a  portfolio-notional  consideration  because  the  portfolio  size 

normalization inherent at ùëõ(cid:2868) = ùëêùëúùëõùë†ùë° does not make sense at the limit ùë•(cid:2868) ‚Üí 0. Then we 

can set ùë•(cid:2868) = 0., and finally we can take the limit ùë•(cid:2869) ‚Üí ‚àû.

where ùëõ(cid:2868) is an overall portfolio notional factor. 

As a reference, here is the comparison between the value of a Uniswap v3 vs a Uniswap v2 

liquidity portfolio 

Value Uniswap v2 vs v3 portfolio 

We see that while Uniswap v2 offers some participation in the upside of the risk asset (the 

LP portfolio value grows like ‚àöùë• when the risk asset grows like ùë•), the upside of Uniswap 

13 

 
v3 is flat over and beyond the upper end of the range. Likewise on the downside, the value 

of the Uniswap v3 portfolio descends significantly  quicker than that  of the Uniswap v2 

portfolio (‚àöùë• for v2 vs ùë• for v3), even though ultimately, at ùë• = 0, they coincide at a zero 

value. 

Uniswap v3 Impermanent Loss 

Impermanent  Loss  is  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  HODL  performance  of  the 

contributed  assets,  and  the  performance  of  the  corresponding  AMM  portfolio.  In  a 

traditional AMM assets are always contributed in equal value, therefore the HODL value 

of a portfolio in terms of the numeraire asset is proportional to 1 + ùë•, where the 1 represents 

one unit of the numeraire asset and x represents one unit of the risk asset, and the exchange 

ratio x is normalised to ùë•(ùë° = 0) = 1. 

For Uniswap v3 we need to modify this formula in that our reference portfolio now consists 

of ùëÅ(cid:3041)(ùë•) units of the numeraire asset, and ùëÅ(cid:3045)(ùë•) units of the risk asset, with a suitable 

normalization choice for ùëõ(cid:2868). This of course is straight forward. 

We also need to take into account that liquidity providers can add or remove liquidity over 

time, and that this will generally happen at ùë•(ùë°) ‚â† ùë•(0) and therefore at a different asset 

composition. The way we have dealt with this issue in that we consider that every time 

liquidity is added or removed, we consider that this as a novation of the position. In other 

words, we assume that at every change in liquidity the entire position is closed, and a new 

position corresponding the post-liquidity holdings is opened. Moreover, for IL calculation 

purposes we assumed that all open positions are closed out at the point of calculation. 

To calculate the IL of one of those imputed positions we place ourselves in the numeraire 

of one of the participating tokens. It is easy to verify that for calculating the percentage IL 

the choice of numeraire does not matter as long as the numeraire is one of the two tokens 

involved or a linear combination thereof. However, it is also easy to see that in general the 

choice of numeraire does matter. As an example, we consider an ETH BTC pool where 

ETH  appreciates  by  20%  against  the  USD  and  BTC  appreciates  by  10%.  Whilst  this 

position has a (small) IL when considered in either BTC or ETH, in a USD numeraire the 

IL becomes a gain instead of a loss because the effect of the average price rise outweighs 

the impact of the price divergence. 

Once  we  have  the  percentage  IL  number,  we  convert  this  into  a  USD  number  by 

multiplying with the spot exchange rate at the time the imputed position was closed for 

further aggregation. We note that the choice of numeraire here is not an innocent choice in 

that it does influence outcome in a non-trivial manner when exchange rates and asset prices 

14 

are changing significantly. However, it does guarantee that IL is always a loss and never a 

gain,  an  outcome  that  naive  IL  aggregation  methods  cannot  guarantee,  and  we  have 

convinced ourselves that the variation introduced by the choice of numeraire does in this 

case not alter our findings substantially. 

15 

 
 
Descriptive Pool Level Statistics 

In this section we focus on a number of statistics to set the scene, and to lay the groundwork 

for what we will discuss later. These numbers are by and large well known, and typically 

accessible either via the Uniswap v3 user interface, or via data services like Dune Analytics. 

Introduction and methodology 

Our entire analysis is based on a dataset pulled on September 20th, 2021. It should be mostly 

self-consistent. However, as the process of pulling the data takes a number of hours some 

inconsistencies cannot be avoided. Also, we often translate numbers into USD. In order to 

do this, we use hourly dollar rates from querying Dune Analytics‚Äô prices.usd and we match 

all events to the closest hourly data. 

Uniswap v3 has 3 types of pools that differ in fee levels and tick spacing. The idea is that 

high fee pools serve highly volatile pairs, and therefore a bigger grid spacing is appropriate, 

and  vice  versa.  However,  there  is  no  requirement  to  choose  any  specific  pool  for  any 

specific pair, and for many of the pairs there are multiple pools available competing with 

each other for liquidity and trading. 

When naming a pool, we follow Uniswap conventions by starting with the two constituent 

assets and then to appended to the name of the pool is the fee level of that pool. The fee 

level can only have three distinct values:  10000 for a 1% fee pool, 3000 for a 0.3% fee 

pool, and 500 for a 0.05% pool. 

For example, the USDCWETH3000 pool is the pool trading USDC against wrapped ETH, 

at a fee level of 30bp. Contrary to ISO currency descriptions, within the Uniswap UI there 

is no consistency between the way  the pool exchange ratios are quoted and  the order in 

which they appear in the pool name. We generally follow the convention that if one of the 

constituents is a stable coin, we use it as numeraire. Otherwise, we prefer exchange ratios 

>1 to those <1.  

As already  alluded to above, the  perennial problem  when aggregating  data across  many 

different assets that are highly volatile against each other is that the choice of numeraire is 

not an innocent choice. This can even affect numbers as straightforward as aggregate trade 

volume and fee levels. 

To give an example, we assume two trading periods with 100m worth of TKN trades each, 

and associated fees of 3000 TKN in each period. Furthermore, we assume that TKN was at 

1,000 USD in period 1, and at 2,000 USD in period 2. Converting volume and fees into 

USD in the respective periods yields 100b USD of trading in period 1 and 200b USD in 

16 

period 2, with the corresponding fee income of 3m and 6m USD respectively, and a total 

volume of 300b USD and 9m USD in fees. Converting all numbers at the end however 

yields 400b USD in volume and 12m USD in fees. There is no single right answer to the 

above question. We often prefer to convert numbers into USD when they accrue as opposed 

to at the end, as the change due to changes in the exchange rate can lead to perplexing 

results. However, this also depends on the specific analysis undertaken, and there is no hard 

and fast rule. 

TVL Statistics 

In this section here we look at the Total Value Locked in the different pools, both at the 

last day of the analysis, and averaged over time, with exchange rate conversion at the end 

date. 

Latest TVL per pool 

17 

 
Average TVL per pool 

We firstly notice that the choice ‚Äúaverage vs latest  numbers‚Äù does make a difference in 

some  cases,  but  substantially  the  charts  are  very  similar.  Our  key  takeaway  from  those 

charts is that Uniswap v3 is very much geared to the biggest pools ‚Äì the biggest pool alone 

(USDCWETH3000) has 25-30% of all TVL, and the two biggest ones together are close 

to 50%. Moreover over 75% of the TVL is in pools that trade ETH or BTC against a USD 

stable coin or against each other. The biggest pool that does not fit into this category is 

UNIWETH with 6-7% of all TVL, depending on the measure, and from there the pool size 

descends quickly. 

Fee and trade volume statistics 

Having looked at TVL ‚Äì the key driver of Impermanent Loss ‚Äì we now look at the other 

side of the equation, the trade volume, and more importantly the associated fees. Optically 

the fees pie chart looks very similar to the TVL pie charts, with the notable observation 

that  WETHUSDT3000  and  WBTCWETH3000  switch  places  ‚Äì  the  share  of  fees  of  the 

stable coin pools is substantially  higher than its  TVL share when compared  to the ETH 

WBTC pool. 

18 

 
Aggregate fees per pool (from trade volume) 

The other notable observation here is that fees in the 5bp USDCWETH500 pool are only 

about 25% of those in its 30bp brethren, despite the 5bp TVL being only about 1/3 of the 

30bp TVL, and the fee level being only 1/6. 

Trade volume per pool 

19 

 
 
Positions and address statistics 

We  will  now look  at  unique positions, and  at  unique  addresses.  It  should be noted  that 

positions can be modified over time and as we‚Äôve discussed above in the IL calculation, we 

consider every modification its own imputed position. This however is not the case here ‚Äì 

positions in this analysis are simply Uniswap v3 NFTs, regardless of the number of times 

they are modified. 

Unique addresses are consolidated on a per-pool but not on a cross-pool basis. We have not 

correlated different addresses operated by a single owner, so it is likely to be bigger than 

the number of LPs, and the biggest / most active addresses may not necessarily correspond 

to be biggest / most active LPs. 

Unique addresses 

20 

 
Positions 

Positions and addresses 

In  the  chart  above  we  show  the  number  of  addresses  and  positions  for  specific  pools, 

normalized  to  the  number of  positions  =  100%.  We see  that  depending  on  the  pool the 

number of addresses is 20% - 80% of the number of positions, so in average each address 

runs 1.25-4 positions, depending on the pool. 

Pools Analyzed 

The charts below show the average and current TVL of the pools that we have already seen 

in the pie chart above, as well as the fees earned. 

21 

 
 
Average TVL 

Total Fees 

The chart below finally shows the ROI of those different pools. This is a percentage number 

and is not annualized. The ETH USDT pools start at about 30% ROI, with the 5bp ETH 

USDT pool still remarkably at over 30% ROI because of its very high trading volumes. 

After that the ROI numbers decrease quickly, and in the tail the average ROI is under 10%. 

Percentage ROI before IL (not annualized) 

22 

 
 
 
Our key question is now: how much of a dent will IL make into those returns? The 

short answer is: a lot, to the extent that on a global level, IL wipes out all fees earned 

by Uniswap v3 liquidity providers. In other words, as a group they would have been 

better off HODLing than providing liquidity on Uniswap v3.  That is what we will 

discuss in what follows. 

23 

 
 
Impermanent Loss Analysis 

Fees vs Impermanent Loss 

We have seen in the descriptive statistics section that Uniswap v3 LPs earned a substantial 

amount of fees both in absolute terms as well as in terms of ROI. However ‚Äì we know that 

LPs  also  suffer  from  Impermanent  Loss  (much  of  which  is  often  permanent).  A  quick 

reminder: we define Impermanent Loss as the loss against HODL, and we are using the 

‚Äúnovation‚Äù methodology discussed above as a means of aggregating IL across pools and 

time.  Also  as  discussed  above,  we  look  at  two types  of  IL  in  the  Uniswap  system:  the 

minimum  IL  which is  the minimum possible  IL  a  sophisticated  investor  can  achieve by 

meticulously managing their position and removing liquidity when it goes out of range, and 

the actual IL that Uniswap LPs have actually suffered.  

Herein, we calculate the fees from the actual transaction data, where we convert into USD 

whenever a user decides to withdraw their fees; not-withdrawn fees are converted at the 

latest available exchange rate. This method is benchmarked and validated against the fees 

inferred  by  the  published  trading  volume  converted  to  USD  at  the  transaction  time.  As 

discussed  above,  for  the  Impermanent  Loss  we  use  imputed  positions  that  effectively 

novate a position every time it is adjusted. This however only gives us percentage IL, and 

to aggregate it we need to convert it into USD. We perform the conversion at every novation 

date  when  an  imputed  position  is  closed,  and  at  the  last  available  exchange  rate  where 

positions are still open. 

Aggregate fees per pool 

This is to be compared with the actual IL incurred that we plot in the chart below. 

24 

 
Actual Impermanent Loss 

Below we put the two charts together into one. The second of the charts is the same as the 

first one, except with a different scale to allow for examination of the smaller pools. 

Fees vs Actual IL (whole cohort) 

25 

 
 
Fees vs Actual IL (whole cohort, rescaled) 

The  way  to  read  the above  charts  is  as  follows:  the  left-most  pool  (USDCWETH3000) 

earned a little more than $80m since inception. However, during the same time, the IL in 

the  pool  is  over  $90m,  meaning  that  if  Uniswap  LPs  had  just  HODLd  their  initial  LP 

positions in the same composition as they contributed it, they would have, in aggregate, 

made $90m. So, after fees the LPs in Uniswap‚Äôs biggest pool are still $10m+ worse off 

than had they just HODLd. 

This experience is not unique to the USDCWETH3000 pool. In aggregate over all the pools 

above, the fees earned were $199m whilst the IL was $260m or 130% of the fees earned ‚Äì 

so Uniswap LPs in those pools would have been $61m better off had they HODLd. 

Out of all the pools above, only two of them have fees higher than IL ‚Äì AXSWETH3000 

fees are $4m, and IL is $3.75m leaving a modest profit of $0.25m  for  all LPs together, 

when compared to the fees accrued. Similarly, FMTWETH10000 where the fees are $1.6m 

and the IL is $1.1m yielding a profit of $0.5m. 

Minimum vs actual IL 

Above we discussed minimum vs actual IL. As a reminder ‚Äì minimum IL is the IL incurred 

whilst the position is in range, so this is the IL that is unavoidable to incur when wanting 

to earn fees. The actual IL is the IL that the positions in fact suffered, and that includes the 

IL that has been incurred outside of the range where no fees have been earned and where a 

rational LP would have cut the position. In other words ‚Äì the minimum IL is the minimum 

IL that an investor who monitors their positions 24/7 would be able to achieve, on positions 

26 

 
that are sizeable enough so that the gas costs of the necessary adjustments do not matter. 

In the charts below the minimum IL is marked by the white line. 

We should also point out there is a sweet spot here in terms of adjustment: if the position 

is too small, the gas costs will be too high to make rebalancing worthwhile. If the position 

is  too  big  however  then  rebalancing  it  back  into  the  initial  HODL  position  may  incur 

substantial price slippage. The reason for this is that the position will, by construction of 

Uniswap v3, be 100% in the recently underperforming asset that has just breached the lower 

bounds of that range. Rebalancing means selling this asset against the asset against which 

it  just  has  underperformed.  In  other  words:  rebalancing  may  mean  to  sell  into a  falling 

market, the additional costs of which can be substantial. 

Fees vs Actual and Minimal IL (whole cohort) 

27 

 
Fees vs Actual and Minimal IL (whole cohort, rescaled) 

Another  thing  we  would like  to  allude  to  here  ‚Äì  but  which  is  the  topic  of  forthcoming 

research ‚Äì is that rebalancing positions locks in IL, meaning at this stage it is definitely no 

longer impermanent. This is very similar to delta hedging an  option:  whenever the spot 

moves the trader has to decide whether to rebalance the delta ‚Äì which incurs transaction 

costs and locks in the Gamma bleed ‚Äì or hope that the spot returns to its initial value at 

which stage the position is again perfectly hedged. 

The situation is similar here: whenever the spot price leaves the range, a certain IL has been 

incurred by the LP who then has two options: 

1.  Do  nothing,  sit outside  the  range,  earn no fees,  and  hope  the  spot  returns to its 

initial value. 

2.  Cut the position, crystallize the IL (typically 3-10%) and either leave the game, or 

place at the current range to have another throw of the dice. 

We  are  working  on  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  and  some  theoretical  analysis  to  better 

understand the effects of this phenomenon, and this will be subject of forthcoming research. 

Segmentation by duration of the position 

After finding that on average Uniswap v3 users do not perform better than HODL we then 

tried  to  understand  whether  some  groups  consistently  do  better  than  others,  further 

increasing the losses of the underperforming groups.  

Our first analysis was to look at what we called active and passive users, where the latter 

were defined as those who contributed liquidity exactly once, and who either still held that 

28 

 
position  without  any  modifications,  or  who  had  closed  it  out  in  a  single  withdrawal 

transaction. When we ran this analysis, we found no statistically meaningful differences 

between those two groups. This meant that either sophisticated users of Uniswap v3 did 

not manage to capture profits from their less sophisticated peers, or we did not have the 

right segmentation to analyze this hypothesis. We realized that our passive group consisted 

of two very different segments: 

ÔÇ∑ 

Inactive users who ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù their LP positions until they eventually 

withdraw, not necessarily at the optimal point in time, and 

ÔÇ∑  Highly sophisticated users who, for reasons of privacy or others, quickly add 

and withdraw their positions frequently but do not reuse LP tokens, and maybe 

not even addresses. 

So, in the second state of this analysis, we also looked at the tenure or lifetime of a position, 

on  the  assumption  that,  on  average,  those  who  go  into  the  market  and  leave  it  shortly 

thereafter are more sophisticated, or at least more active, than those who stay longer.   

Cumulative percentage of active positions vs position lifetime 

To start with an overview, the above chart shows the cumulative number of positions as a 

function of their duration. The way to read this chart is that about 5% of all positions are 

flash positions (they only exist for a single block), another about 5% exists for at most an 

hour. 20% of positions exist more than an hour but less than a day, another 25% more than 

a day but less than a week, another 20% in the month, and finally another 30% are longer 

than a month.  

29 

 
Cumulative percentage of fees captured vs position lifetime 

The above chart is the same as the one before it, expect that we are looking at percentage 

of fees instead of percentage of positions. What is interesting is that the smaller numbers 

are not as small as one may expect them to be. For example, the ‚Äúwithin one week‚Äù segment 

went from ca 55% of total positions to ca 40% of total fees. Given that ‚Äúwithin one month‚Äù 

group remained constant, one would expect a division of the total fee share in the "within 

one week" segment by 4 (number of weeks in a month, rounded to the nearest integer) to 

about 15% of the total fees rather than the 40%. 

On first sight we may expected this to translate into a better risk-adjusted performance of 

short-term  LPs  when  compared  to  long-term  LPs.  However,  when  looking  at  the  chart 

below this does not seem to be the case: 

30 

 
 
 
Fees vs IL by time active (whole cohort) 

In the chart above we see the fees and IL for each of the segments and we see that out of 

the major fee earning segments, the >1m segment does perform best ‚Äì but only in relative 

terms as even for them the IL outpaces the fees. 

The only group that we could identify that consistently made money when compared to 

simply  HODLing  was  flash  LPs  who  only  provided  liquidity  during  one  block.  This 

behavior has been coined Just-In-Time (JIT) liquidity. The liquidity was  provided intra-

block and it did not cause any meaningful IL. All other segments have an IL/fees ratio that 

is greater than 1. 

31 

 
 
 
Ratio IL vs fees (whole cohort) 

The chart above illustrates this: it plots IL / fees for the various time slices. IL is in a way 

the  cost  of running a  position,  therefore  the above chart  plots  something  like  the  cost / 

income ratio popular in analyzing traditional financial institutions. Cost / income ratios > 

1 mean the institution loses money, and here this is similar: in the 1h-1d slice the ratio went 

close to 1.8, meaning they lost (compared to HODL) $180 for every $100 in fees, leaving 

a net loss (against HODL) of $80 for every $100 in fees. 

32 

 
 
 
Risk adjusted returns (fees/IL ‚Äì 1) 

The above chart is a slight reshuffle of the previous one for those who prefer return-style 

numbers to cost/income ratios. Here we calculate fees / IL (note that the previous chart was 

the inverse) and then subtract 1. If we consider IL a risk measure rather than a cost, then 

this  is  a  risk-adjusted  return  number,  or  a  RORAC  (return  on  risk-adjusted  capital).  A 

number > 0 means the positions made money (against HODL), and a number < 0 means 

they‚Äôve lost. We see above that all positions lost, except the flash slice where IL = 0 means 

this measure diverges towards positive infinity. 

33 

 
 
 
 
Positive vs. Negative Returns 

In this section we are aggregating the positions by wallets  and are segmenting them by 

whether the overall returns of the wallet were positive (green), or whether they lost money 

(red). Positions with less than less than $1 of liquidity were removed from this analysis. 

Percentage of wallets with pos/neg returns 

Above  we  show  the  percentage  of  wallets  per  pool  with  positive  vs.  negative  returns. 

Looking across the different pools, the percentage of users incurring negative returns is 

generally between 40-60% per pool. On the low end, in the FTM/ETH pool, roughly 34% 

of users have negative returns, while on the high end, in the MKR/ETH pool, roughly 74% 

of users have negative returns. 

Mean USD returns per wallet in positive and negative segments 

34 

 
 
The above chart is a bit more complex so we describe it in pieces. The key information is 

on the left side of the chart where we look at the mean return (in USD) by wallet and pool, 

separated  by  wallets  that  lost  money  (red)  and  wallets  that  made  money  (green).  The 

number of wallets (‚Äún‚Äù) in each group is also shown. The chart on the right side gives the 

percentage of wallets that made or lost money per pool.  For example, we can see in the 

USDCWETH500 pool that 1,057 LP wallets or 62% of LPs in the pool have lost money, 

with  a  mean  return  of  -$18,245,  whereas  648  LP  wallets  or  38%  of  LPs  in  the 

USDCWETH500 pool earned money, with a mean return of $2,251. 

The first thing to take away is that the red bars tend to be longer than the green bars, so the 

average loss is bigger than the average gain which is consistent with the average LP losing 

money. The WBTCUSDC3000 and FTMWETH10000 pools are outliers here, where not 

only the average gain was higher than the average loss but also where the number of wallets 

making money is higher than those losing money. That is of course consistent with these 

pools being some of the few pools that make money for the average LP. It should also be 

noted that these pools are relatively small (1-6% TVL) when compared with the other pools 

analyzed. 

Here we look at the percentage of wallets with positive vs. negative returns by the amount 

of capital contributed. Within each group, the percentage of wallets with negative returns 

is larger, and the percentage of wallets with negative returns  grows with the size  of  the 

capital contributed, suggesting that larger LPs are suffering higher IL. We attribute this to 

larger LPs spreading their positions across wider ranges and therefore collecting fewer fees. 

35 

 
ROIs 

In this section we are looking at average ROIs. 

We have seen a similar chart above where we looked at the average USD returns. Here we 

are instead looking at the average ROIs [(Fees - IL) /  time-weighted average  liquidity]. 

These ROIs are not annualized. We again see that the red bars ‚Äì the average ROI for the 

segment  of  users  with  negative  returns  ‚Äì  tend  to  be  bigger  than  the  green  bars,  which 

represent the average ROI for the segment of users with positive returns. Also, the numbers 

are generally relatively small: on the positive returns side, the best average return per pool 

is  around  2.6%,  for  FTMWETH10000.  That  is  a  nice  return  for  a  quarter,  but  not 

overwhelming  in  the  grand  scheme  of  things.  We  then  have  five  pools  who  return  an 

average above 1%, and the remainder of pools are below 1%, all the way down to 0.1-0.2%. 

In the red segment, the median is about -1.8%, and the range is from -0.6% to -3.5%.

Conclusion 

In this paper we have looked at the economic performance of the leveraged AMM design 

pattern, as implemented by Uniswap v3. The economic performance of every AMM has 

three components:  

Fee income  

1. 
2.  Gas cost  
3. 

Impermanent loss  

The first component, fee income, has been well studied as it is commonly available on the 

Uniswap UI and aggregated in various public dashboards. We found that, while gas costs 

appear high, in practice they have little effect on the outcome of the cases we have studied. 

It is likely that this is a case of self-selection. Gas costs are a highly transparent and upfront 

‚Äúcash‚Äù cost, so potential LPs self-select and will simply not engage in a transaction should 

the gas costs be prohibitively high. However, it was found that Impermanent Loss (or ‚ÄúIL‚Äù) 

is the dominant factor in determining the financial impact of liquidity provision on Uniswap 

v3.  Importantly,  the  primary  revenue  generation  -  the  fee  income  ‚Äì  is  all  but  entirely 

eclipsed in aggregate by the IL; all fees earned by Uniswap v3 participants are rendered 

inconsequential, on average, in the face of the IL to which they are exposed. To the best of 

our knowledge, this publication is the first to explore these data in detail. 

The  findings  reported  here  go  against  the  widely  held  belief  that  leveraged  liquidity 

provision  offers  a  reliable  means  to  mitigate  IL.  We have made  a  deliberate  attempt  to 

identify  sub-groups  that  consistently  outperform  others  on  Uniswap  v3  and  have  been 

unsuccessful. Therefore, we were unable to confirm our hypothesis that ‚Äúactive‚Äù LPs (those 

who  are  dynamically  managing  their  position)  are  more  successful  than  ‚Äúinactive‚Äù  LPs 

(roughly  defined  as  those  who  interact  with  their  position  infrequently,  regardless  of 

whether their liquidity is in range). Within a reasonable margin of error, the performance 

of  both  groups  is  indistinguishable.  It  could  be  that  our  inactive  cohort  is  in  fact  an 

amalgamation of two distinct types of players: those that withdraw their position quickly 

and  open  a  new  one  (possibly  from  another  address)  and  those  who  stay  in  their  static 

positions for a long time. By that same token, we cannot be certain that all interactions with 

a liquidity position are motivated by a desire to optimize its performance. 

In short, the user who decides to not provide liquidity can expect to grow the value of their 

portfolio at a faster rate than one who is actively managing a liquidity position on Uniswap 

v3. In fact, only 3 of the 17 pools analyzed earned fees that exceeded the IL, and only by a 

small margin. Those 3 pools were mid-sized pools of about $2m, $4m, and $8m fee income, 

and the outperformance was de minimis ($2m in aggregate profits with aggregate fees of 

37 

about $14m, and aggregate IL of about $12m). It must be said that the newly born industry 

of  liquidity  optimizers  are facing  an  apparently  insurmountable  problem.  Certainly,  our 

findings suggest that a winning strategy could be formulated (although it seems that no one 

has  yet),  and  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  one  among  the  plethora  of  new  projects 

claiming to have the proverbial secret sauce may actually achieve it. However, the expected 

returns may be comparable to the annual rates offered by mainstream consumer banking 

products.  

The  time  that  a  position  has  remained  open,  and  its  correlation  with  fee  revenue  as  a 

proportion  of  IL  is  worth  further  comment.  The  only  group  that  we  could  identify  that 

consistently made money when compared to simply HODLing was  flash LPs who only 

provided  liquidity  during  one  block.  This  behavior  has  since  been  coined  Just-In-Time 

(JIT) liquidity. In this group there was no meaningful IL. In the other groups the IL / fees 

ratio was always >100%, meaning they lost out. In fact, it went as high as almost 180%, 

meaning a loss of $180 for every $100 earned in fees, leaving a net loss of $80.  

JIT  liquidity  notwithstanding,  shorter  positions  seemed  to  be  more  profitable  when 

examining fees earned per unit of time; however, the fees on such short timeframes were 

overshadowed  by  their  IL.  The  shortest-lived  positions  (of  those  longer  than  one  hour) 

generally and consistently had the worst fee-over-IL (akin to risk-adjusted returns) ratios, 

and the longest positions (over 1 month) had the most forgiving fee-over-IL ratios, although 

both groups lost money. To explain this effect, we refer to our earlier economic analyses 

of the AMM model, and specifically the fact that IL grows in square root time while fees 

accumulate linearly in time. While compelling, this explanation is still incomplete, and the 

time-dependence of the fee-to-IL ratios will require further examination.  

The  most  fertile  area  for  further  research  that  we  have  identified  is  to  refine  our  LP 

segmentation, and to explicitly identify the users that that have positive returns after IL, ie 

those  that  outperform  the  HODL  strategy.  This  is  particularly  interesting  because  the 

protocol on average does worse than HODL, so every marginal dollar won by a fortunate 

Uniswap LP is a marginal dollar lost by a less fortunate one.

APPENDIX 

IL calculation in Uniswap v3 

To value a user‚Äôs activities on Uniswap V3, the number of each token associated with their 

liquidity position must be interrogated. This in non-trivial, as their quantities at any point 

in time are under the influence of variables that are not recorded to the blockchain. For 

example,  the  tick  number,  and  therefore the  effective  price  at  the  same  moment  a  user 

adjusts  their  position  is  not  readable.  This  is  problematic  as  it  is  implicitly  required  to 

calculate the user‚Äôs remaining balances. However, these values can be deduced using data 

that is available from the blockchain.  

During  an  adjustment  to  a  user‚Äôs  liquidity  position  ‚Äì  whether  it  be  a  withdrawal,  or 

contribution of additional liquidity ‚Äì the relative quantity of both tokens associated with 

the  change  must  be  equal  to  the  relative  quantity  of  tokens  present  inside  the  position 

before, and after the change is made. For example, it may be observed that a user added 

additional tokens to their Uv3 position, where 1√óTKN0 and 2√óTKN1 were transferred into 

an existing position. The ratio of TKN0 relative to the total token count, 1/(1 + 2), denoted 

here as r, is identical to their ratio inside the existing position. Combined with the variables 

that are available from the blockchain (tick ranges and the liquidity constant), the precise 

balance of TKN0 can be calculated from the ratio of the two assets (r), and the prices at the 

corresponding tick boundaries (ùëÉ(cid:3029) and ùëÉ(cid:3029)): 

ùêø (cid:4678)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)(ùëü ‚àí 1) ‚àí ùëü + (cid:3495)ùëÉ(cid:3028)ùëÉ(cid:3029)(ùëü ‚àí 1)(cid:2870) + ùëü(cid:2870) + (2ùëü ‚àí 2)(cid:3435)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùëü ‚àí 2ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùëü(cid:3439)(cid:4679)

ùë• =

2ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùëü

With the quantity x in hand, the quantity of TKN1 (y) can be calculated directly from x via 

the Uv3 swap function:  

ùë¶ =

ùêø(cid:3435)‚àíùêø(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028) + ùêø(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029) ‚àí (cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùë•(cid:3439)
ùêø + (cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùë•

Uv3‚Äôs internal price (Pi) can also be calculated directly from x:  

ùëÉ(cid:3036) =

ùêø(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)
ùêø + (cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùë•

+

ùêø(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)(cid:3435)‚àíùêø(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028) + ùêø(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029) ‚àí (cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3028)(cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùë•(cid:3439)

(cid:3435)ùêø + (cid:3493)ùëÉ(cid:3029)ùë•(cid:3439)

(cid:2870)

And the tick (ùëá(cid:3036)) can be calculated directly from the price (ùëÉ(cid:3036)): 

ùëá(cid:3036) =

log(ùëÉ(cid:3036))
log(1.0001)

To compute the impermanent loss, we use a novation method that simulates the complete 

withdrawal  of  all  liquidity  from  the  position,  followed  by  a  simulated  redeposit,  thus 

allowing  the  partial  IL  to  be  realized  over  an arbitrary  number  of  add/remove  liquidity 

interactions via the Uv3 contracts. To achieve this, the above equations are solved at two 

different time points to determine x and y, using the appropriate r value as observed on the 

blockchain, and the same liquidity constant, L, for each. The initial and final quantities of 

TKN0 and TKN1 are denoted as x0 and x1, and y0 and y1, respectively. Of course, only the 

price  associated  with  the  final  time  point,  P1,  is  required  to  determine  the  IL  over  this 

period:  

ùêºùêø =

ùëÉ(cid:2869)ùë•(cid:2869) + ùë¶(cid:2869)
ùëÉ(cid:2869)ùë•(cid:2868) + ùë¶(cid:2868)

Technical Considerations 

Overall, this analysis was extremely interesting, but also surprisingly complex. Firstly, the 

concept of IL is not easy to define. In particular, the numeraire dependence can never be 

avoided when handling data that includes funds being contributed or withdrawn over time. 

While  IL  can  be  expressed  as  a  dimensionless  percentage  number,  this  number  is  not 

invariant  under  numeraire  transformations.  This  is  inconvenient,  and  annoying,  but 

ultimately unavoidable. It should be noted that while the numbers are not invariant, the 

variance does not affect the result substantially when considering numeraires that have been 

evolving largely in line. It becomes important only when the different numeraires diverge 

dramatically (say by a factor of 3x or more) because in this case it impacts how past IL is 

carried forward in time. So, while our numbers are not invariant under numeraire change, 

the  main  finding  ‚Äì  Impermanent  Loss  exceeds  fees  earned  and  therefore  the  average 

Uniswap v3 LP would have been better off HODLing ‚Äì remains robust. 

Secondly, the technical complexity of the analysis was surprisingly high. This was partially 

driven by having to deal with many different pools, many different assets, and therefore 

many different exchange rates that need to be kept track of in a consistent manner. Also, 

the data that can be obtained is optimized for gas efficiency, and not for ease of access and 

there are some interesting tricks used within the Uniswap v3 code, eg, unsigned integers 

representing  negative  numbers  in  2s  complement  meaning  that  the  formulas  must  be 

evaluated mod at every step when running in Python that does not allow for fixed length 

integers.  For  transparency,  we  offer  our  methodology  and  dataset  from  whence  this 

conclusion was derived, to the DeFi community for review and scrutinization.
