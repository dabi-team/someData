ABSTRACT

Industry 4.0 in health care has evolved drastically over the past century. In fact, it is evolving every
day, with new tools and strategies being developed by physicians and researchers alike. Health care
and technology have been intertwined together with the advancement of cloud computing and big
data. This study aims to analyze the impact of industry 4.0 in health care systems. To do so, a
systematic literature review was carried out considering peer-reviewed articles extracted from the two
popular databases: Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). PRISMA statement 2015 was used to include
and exclude that data. At ﬁrst, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using 346 articles considering
the following factors: publication by year, journal, authors, countries, institutions, authors’ keywords,
and citations. Finally, qualitative analysis was carried out based on selected 32 articles considering the
following factors: a conceptual framework, schedule problems, security, COVID-19, digital supply
chain, and blockchain technology. Study ﬁnding suggests that during the onset of COVID-19, health
care and industry 4.0 has been merged and evolved jointly, considering various crisis such as data
security, resource allocation, and data transparency. Industry 4.0 enables many technologies such as
the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, big data, cloud computing, machine learning, deep learning,
information, and communication technologies (ICT) to track patients’ records and helps reduce social
transmission COVID-19 and so on. The study ﬁndings will give future researchers and practitioners
some insights regarding the integration of health care and Industry 4.0.

Introduction

Industry 4.0, is the fourth industrial revolution [1] since the introduction of electricity to factories in the 19th century
and Internet technology to business in the 90s. The digitization of business processes and the Internet of Things
(IoT) have already started transforming the world of manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management [2];
however, health care has been lagging behind in terms of digitalization and innovation [3]. Thanks to the proliferation
of mobile devices and medical instruments, healthcare technologies can now connect and exchange data with each
other on an unprecedented scale [4]. The health care industry has made several major transformations over the past
few decades, from introducing vaccines and antibiotics to creating patient-centered care and now to next-generation
genomic medicine [5]. At each stage in this evolution, we have seen an explosion of innovation that changed how
patients and providers interact with one another.
As the establishment of tools grows, health care systems experience radical modiﬁcations and technical speciﬁcations
concerning industry 4.0 [6]. Industrial revolution 4.0 or, in short, IR 4.0 emerges signiﬁcantly during the onset of
COVID-19. Factors such as social distancing and lockdown in various nations signiﬁcantly affected almost every
country’s economy and industrial domain [7, 8]. As a result, a compulsory merger of IR 4.0 was observed more during
the onset of COVID-19 years compared to previous decades. The deadly COVID-19 brings forth many healthcare
lackings worldwide, and many countries like Bangladesh, India, the USA, and the UK failed to facilitate health care

systems appropriately [9, 10, 11].
However, technological advancement plays a vital role during this pandemic. In order to keep up with the demands
of their patients, many healthcare professionals are turning to new technologies, including mobile apps and remote
monitoring, to improve the quality of patient care they provide. For example, telemedicine allows nurses and physicians
to reach patients in rural or isolated areas who might otherwise have trouble ﬁnding adequate medical care, while
wearable technology helps to monitor cardiac conditions [12] and other ailments over time. These new tools allow for
more efﬁcient services that can provide medical services for distant residents and reduce the loads on the hospitals and
emergency rooms [13].
The advent of COVID-19 and the adoption of IR 4.0 in health care generates various directions. Therefore, there is a
need to integrate all those directions in a nutshell. Considering this opportunity into account, this study aims to conduct
a systematic review of recently published literature that concentrated on two key factors: health care and Industry 4.0.
The literature on Industry 4.0 in health care (IHC) is expanding at an exponential rate (see Fig. 2), highlighting the
need to transmit new insights and directions based on the most current advances in the existing research. Thus, 346
publications were analyzed bibliometrically to answer the following study questions: who are the notable authors?
What is the current trend in publishing? What are the most inﬂuential journals? Which countries, institutions, and topics
make the most contributions? Furthermore, from which essential concepts may the extant IHC literature be classiﬁed?
Furthermore, in order to provide some insight into IHC, the study intended to answer the following questions using 32
referenced literature:

1. What are the most important applications of Industry 4.0 in health care?

2. What are the current Industry 4.0 challenges and constraints in health care?

3. What are the potential future applications of Industry 4.0 in health care?

It should be noted that all 32 references were retrieved using the inclusion criteria as outlined in Section 2.The remainder
of the section is organized as follows: Section 3 describes the bibliometric study based on the relevant literature, and
Section 4 presents the IHC ﬁndings. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the general ﬁndings and offers some suggestions for
future study and practice areas for researchers and practitioners.

2 Methodology

PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [14] is a prominent and extensively
used approach for presenting a systematic review [15]. This study reported on a PRISMA-based systematic literature
review (SLR). Paper searching, screening, and selection were carried out in accordance with the PRISMA 2015
guidelines, as indicated in Figure 1. The ﬁrst search was conducted using two major datasets: Scopus and Web of
Science (WOS). Many scholars and practitioners rely on Scopus and WOS databases for locating quality articles and
SLR [16, 13, 17, 18]. To keep the study aim more focused and key oriented, we used the Boolean operator with "health
care" and "Industry 4.0" during the initial search, yielding 869 articles from Scopus and 378 articles from WOS. When
the article is restricted to journal papers, peer review, and English, the whole article after title, keyword, and abstract
analysis reached to 346.
One researcher (Z.S.) imported data from 346 journal articles into Excel CSV ﬁles in preparation for a more in-depth
investigation. Using Excel’s duplication tools, duplicates were discovered and eliminated [17]. Two independent
reviewers evaluated the titles and abstracts of 346 articles (M.A. and Z.S.). To eliminate bias, disputes about article
selection were settled by discussion and agreement. Based on the inclusion-exclusion criteria indicated in Fig. 1, a total
of 32 papers were identiﬁed for qualitative synthesis.

3 Bibliometric analysis

The following section describes the bibliometric analysis of selected 346 articles. The bibliometric analysis was carried
out using Excel data analysis, R-Studio software, and VoSviewer software. The bibliometric analysis includes the
analysis of the articles based on the article’s publication by year, discipline, journals, citations, authors, countries,
institutions, keywords, and co-authorship analysis.

3.1 Publication by year

Fig. 2 depicts the large increase in research article publications over the previous seven years, demonstrating a higher
degree of interest in the academic community in Industry 4.0 in healthcare (IHC). The statistic shows that the published
literature was nearly non-existent between 2005 to 2015. The number of published publications in 2021 is expected to

2

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 19, 2022

Figure 1: Flow diagram of article selection procedure used in this study using PRISMA 2015 [15]

be over 90, while in 2015 it was only 2. We anticipate that the exponential rise in IHC publication will continue in 2022
and later years.

3.2 Publication by discipline

Fig. 3 depicts the IHC literature in a range of subject areas. IHC research is dominated by engineering and computer
science, which account for 24.5 percent and 19.8 percent of total publications, respectively. Furthermore, interest in
IHC has increased in other disciplines such as material science, mathematics, and so on.

3.3 Publication by journals

We examined the most productive articles in the IHC domains. Fig. 4 illustrates the top ten journals and the overall
number of articles published during the preceding decades. According to referenced literature, the three most productive
journals are IEEE Access (21 publications), Sensors (14 articles), and Sustainability (12 papers). Surprisingly, just 13.5
percent of all cited content was published in the top three publications.

3.4 Publications by citations

The study evaluates the overall amount of citations while collecting data and thoughts on IHC’s renowned authors.
Table 1 displays the ten most frequently referenced publications according to the Scopus and WOS databases. Table 1
shows that each of the authors obtained citations between 44 and 184. Because various databases utilize different
indexing techniques and time periods, the total number of citations may differ from Google Scholar and other database
citations. According to the Table, the paper published by Del et al. (2019) obtained the most citations (184), with 46
citations each year, followed by the article published by Mittal et al. (2019), which earned 154 citations in total (38.5
citations per year). All of the articles in Table 1 are likely to be among the most prominent articles in the IHC.

3.7 Publication by institutions

According to our investigation of the top ten academic institutions, the Technical University of Kosice (Slovakia) is
the most productive, with 12 (approximately 3.46 percent) papers published, as shown in Fig. 5, followed by Brno
University of Technology (Czechia) with 7 (2.02 percent) published articles.

3.8 Common words in keywords

The most commonly used terms by researchers in the keywords section were also analyzed because they typically
express the study’s core topics. R-studio software was used to conduct the analysis. Fig. 6 illustrates the most frequently
used terms in the keyword sections of 346 referenced literature. "Industry 4.0," "COVID-19," "artiﬁcial intelligence,"
and "machine learning" are among the most often used phrases, as evidenced by their high and strong font visibility.
The equivalent analysis and clustering dendrogram for keywords is shown in Fig. 7. In this case, the height indicates the
space between the words and the space indicates how each concept differs from the others.

3.9 Co-authorship of countries

For the co-authorship of countries analysis, the minimum number of publications for a nation was set to 5, demonstrating
the collaboration of authors from diverse geographical locations. As a result, 19 of the 63 countries satisﬁed the
requirement. Figure 2 demonstrates that nations that are geographically close to one another have a strong afﬁnity.
Based on the co-authorship analysis, we discovered that the United States has the most connections with other countries,
with 10 linkages and a total link strength (TLS) of 20, as well as 26 published articles and 2855 citations. India (10
connections, 18 TLS, 23 documents, and 875 citations) and China were next ( Links: 9, TLS: 17, documents: 24 and
citations: 290). Table 4 contains a list of all 19 nations, as well as their relationship strength, number of documents, and
total citations, while Figure 6 depicts a snapshot from the VOSviewer demonstrating how the countries are connected.
Scientiﬁc collaboration is seen as a critical component in improving the quality and impact of research [29]. Expanding
international collaboration may be accomplished through a variety of methods, including increasing the number of
visiting researchers, forming diverse collaborations, and investing substantial funds in research. To enhance international
ties, a comprehensive and adaptable research policy is required [30].

3.10 Co-authorship (authors)

For the research of author co-authorship, a network of co-authors is discovered, and authors who collaborated are
identiﬁed. Co-authorship analysis [31] is the most often used method for analyzing research collaboration (RC) [32].
Researchers’ total co-authorship ties are shown in the links. A researcher’s co-authorship connection with other
researchers [33] is shown using total link strengths (TLS). The minimum number of documents and citations for one
author was set to two and ten, respectively, for the purposes of author co-authorship analysis. Only 49 out of the 773
authors met the criteria. As a result of the close connections among the 49 authors, different distinct groups emerged
(as displayed in Fig. 9). This group of six authors has a wide range of expertise and a long history of working together.
Table 5 displays the links, TLS, documents, and citations for top ten authors. Lee J. has four published articles and
2478 citations and has the highest total link strength (TLS=7), followed by Gosine R. (TLS=6, documents=2, and
citations=19), and James L. (TLS=6, documents=2, and citations=19).

Figure 10: Co-occurence of author keywords networks developed by VOSviewer

3.11 Co-occurrence author keywords

The author’s keyword sections convey information in a unique way. "Co-occurrence" refers to the frequency with which
words appear in speciﬁc publications [32, 34]. The total length of a word’s strength indicates the number of times it
appears in a document. The node size represents the frequency of the words; for example, the larger the node size, the
more common the phrase. A thicker line connecting two or more words shows that they are close to a cluster. Scopus
data were imported into the VOSviewer application for author keyword co-occurrence analysis. With a minimum of
ﬁve keyword occurrences, 385 of 4230 keywords were found. Each of the 385 keywords was classiﬁed into one of ﬁve
clusters. Vosviewer’s co-occurrence networks are depicted in Fig. 10. For instance, Keywords in Cluster 1 include big
data, deep learning, machine learning, prognostics, and health management.

3.12 Bibliographic coupling (documents)

The R-Studio application was used to conduct the bibliographical coupling analysis. The linking of studies that reference
each other is an essential aspect of bibliographic coupling. Our unit of analysis had been determined, and our counting
technique had been meticulously followed. The minimum number of units for this study is 25, the minimum clustering
frequency is 5, and the number of labels per cluster is 5. The wider the circle in Fig. 11, the stronger the bibliographic
connection appears to be. The most prominent cluster was discovered in articles addressing keywords such as future
internet, clean manufacturing, and sensor, with a total frequency of 11 and a centrality of 3.91.

3.13 Thematic evaluation

Based on the distribution of publications each year, we divided our collection into three time periods: 2005-2018,
2019-2019, and 2020-2022. Fig. 12 illustrates a thematic assessment of the authors’ concept based on title analysis.
Topics such as industry, system, and industrial began as specialized themes, and by 2019-2019, a different topic such

11

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 19, 2022

Figure 11: The bibliometric map representing documents coupling

as technology, healthcare, care, and the framework merge with those topics. Manufacturing, smart, and production
become signiﬁcant ideas in IHC between 2020 and 2022, as seen in Fig. 12.

3.14 Historiographic mapping

Fig. 13 depicts a historiographic mapping based on the document titles. Each node in the graph indicates a document
from the examined dataset that has been mentioned by another document. In addition, each title is represented by a
distinct edge. For example, Chute & French (2019), published a paper in 2019 that was cited in one publication in 2020
and three articles in 2021.

Insights of IHC

In this section, industry 4.0 and health care (IHC) have been analyzed in detail based on the selected 32 articles. The
following section presents the papers’ classiﬁcation according to six major categories in IHC. The literature has been
classiﬁed as (i) conceptual framework health care 4.0, (ii) schedule problems, (iii) security issues, (iv) COVID-19, (v)
digital supply chain, and (vi) blockchain technology. Fig. 14 summarizes the overall classiﬁcation of IHC based on the
referenced literature.

4.1 Conceptual framework health care 4.0

Health care has been around since the beginning of civilization, but in the last few decades, it has evolved dramatically.
Health care 1.0 was largely limited to providing physical health services, such as checking vital signs and delivering
babies via natural means. Then, with the advent of modern medicine, health care 2.0 added mechanical services like
surgery and medical machines to its repertoire. Health care 3.0 patient-centric, and health care 4.0 deals with cloud
computing, fog computing, and IoT. With growing population and technological facilities, it is becoming pertinent to
facilitate the health care service with better facility and ﬂexible manner. According to Jayaraman et al. (2019) Healthcare
4.0, is a relatively new phrase developed from Industry 4.0 [35]. In healthcare 4.0, data-driven digital health technologies
include innovative health, online health, mHealth, mobile health, wiﬁ health, eHealth, telehealth/telemedicine, medical

12

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 19, 2022

Figure 12: Thematic assessment of the authors’ notion based on title analysis

information technology digital medicine, health informatics, ubiquitous health, and health information systems [35].
The emerging COVID-19 demonstrated why it is critical to consider IHC when developing various approaches that may
serve both patients and practitioners while providing security, accountability, and system efﬁciency—digital technology
aids in the establishment of a safe working environment for healthcare professionals [36]. A few studies that have
been mentioned provide a conceptual underpinning for more effective and efﬁcient health-care systems. Dobi et al.
(2019), for example, provide a novel technique that is appropriate for use in the health care business, speciﬁcally for
monitoring a patient’s health features. The framework is built using Markov chain-based techniques. The Markov
chain’s stationary distribution may be used to estimate the average cost of the procedure, which is determined by the
time between samplings and the control limit.
Benis et al. (2021) presented One Digital Health, a cohesive framework for long term health environments . The
conceptual framework for One Digital Health is based on two core concepts (One Health and digital Health), three
perspectives (individual health and well-being, people and community, and environment), and independent variables
(citizen engagement, education, environment, human and veterinary health care, and Healthcare Industry 4.0). One
Digital Health’s goal is to digitalize long-term health settings through the adoption of a systematic life and health
sciences approach that considers multiple digital technology views on public health, animal health, and environmental
management. Other issues, such as the exchange of electronic health information, are, however, unresolved within the
jurisdiction of primary health care systems [37].

4.2 Schedule problems

Scheduling problems entail determining the ideal schedule given various objectives, system conditions, and job
characteristics. While manufacturing plant, garments industry extensively faces schedule problems, during the last
decades, health care systems have also considered schedule problems one of the key factors that cause the bottleneck
of the smart health care systems. Several studies identiﬁed schedule problems in health care sectors and proposed a
new scheme to solve those challenges. Dootio et al. (2022) developed the lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) for
the IIoHT mechanism. The study dealt with schedule problems and scheduled all healthcare workloads under their
deadlines. The study uses linear integer programming that helps to reduce the schedule delay up to 50% compared to

13

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 19, 2022

Figure 13: Historiographic mapping

Figure 14: Outcomes of IHC based on referenced literature

14

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 19, 2022

the existing RPC [38].
Chauhan et al. (2021) established and studied seven principles linked to smart healthcare waste disposal systems with
circular economy characteristics to retrieve value of disposables using a decision making trial and evaluation laboratory
(DEMATEL) technique. A causal diagram was used to select the criteria based on their relevance and net cause and
effect connection [39].
Most of the smart health services are hospital-oriented. Additionally, patients’ data are not organized and application-
dependent, causing attention delays in many cases. To overcome such scenarios, Bedon et al. (2020) developed a
home-based smart health model considering the Internet of things (IoT), Internet of medical things, and smart health
applications. The proposed health service reduced the attention delays compared to existing health care facilities [40].
Ajayi et al. (2019) aim to solve the scheduling problem in Africa by developing interconnected medical facilities across
the nations. A cooperative and competitive collaboration model was developed considering two allocation schemes
such Genetic Algorithm-based VM Allocation (GAVA) and Stable Roommate Allocation (SRA) [41]. However, one of
the limitations of that study is that the study result was based on the simulation model. Therefore, the question was
raised regarding the performance of the proposed model in real-world scenarios.

4.3 Security issues

Patient data privacy is one of the most urgent issues in the health-care sector. According to a 2020 study published in
Cybe-rcrime magazine, 93 percent of U.S. healthcare organizations have experienced a severe security breach that
resulted in data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, malware, or other cyber-intrusions. It is impossible to determine
how frequently individuals’ EHR (electronic health record) systems have been hacked without doing an audit of their
EHR (electronic health record) system [42]. Cloud settings have become one of the most enticing areas for hackers
since the bulk of health care systems store patient data on the cloud. In view of the security difﬁculties in IHC, multiple
studies suggested several protective techniques to secure cloud-based medical data.
As a result, the health-care business is working to develop a cloud server that requires a higher level of security and
authenticity. Signcryption, a mix of signature and encryption, for example, has demonstrated promising outcomes in
cloud-based access systems. The bulk of them, however, are better suited to homogeneous rather than heterogeneous
situations. Ullah et al. (2022) developed an access control mechanism for IoT settings that leverages heterogeneous
signcryption to overcome these issues. According to the authors, their proposed technique might survive a range of
risks such as secrecy, integrity, and so on [43]. Khan et al. carried out a similar research (2022). Furthermore, the
author created an efﬁcient signcryption technique for IoT. The Internet of Things makes use of the Internet as a key
channel of communication for single documents as well as multi-digital communications. The author investigated the
following security characteristics in terms of processing cost and transmission bandwidth: anonymity, untraceability,
conﬁdentiality, and unforgeability. The author developed a lightweight and secure proxy blind signcryption for
multi-digital communications using a hyperelliptic curve (HEC), which is less computationally costly and provides
higher transmission capacity [44].

Care 4.0, an integrated care paradigm presented by Chute et al. (2019), aims to provide patients the maximum control
over their medical information. Care 4.0’s overarching objective is to build trustworthy and connected networks that
are linked with digital health and care services. The planned care 4.0 networks and technology may assist individuals
in managing and utilizing their assets, both inside their local care circle and throughout the larger community [45].
In addition to Chute et al., Pace et al. (2019) proposed an efﬁcient application for healthcare industry 4.0. A simple
client module that supports multi-radio and multi-technology is constructed to collect local data. One of the potential
advantages of their proposed architecture is that the capabilities are accessible via both private and public cloud
platforms, providing for better ﬂexibility and resilience. In real-time testing, the proposed design beat competing
devices in terms of data transmission and processing time [21].
Rather than that, Alvarado et al. (2020) deﬁnes Healthcare 4.0 as the adoption of three key paradigms: the Internet
of Things, Big Data, and Cloud Computing, all of which are changing eHealth and its whole ecosystem in the same
manner as Industry 4.0 is modernizing manufacturing [46].

4.4 COVID-19

Over 800 million people have been left without basic health care as a result of the present COVID-19 crisis, which has
resulted in a worldwide epidemic of life-threatening illnesses. While the death toll is believed to exceed 55,000,00,
with an additional 2 million hospitalized each week, this problem is not going away anytime soon [47, 11, 10]. Mobile
applications, robots, Wi-Fi cameras, scanners, and drones are being utilized to combat virus propagation. Industry 4.0
has had an impact on the important contribution of digital technology to pandemic control [48].
The world was in the grip of an unprecedented health-care crisis at the height of COVID-19. As a result, academics
and practitioners develop a wide range of tools and techniques to digitalizing systems in order to minimize disease

15

transmission and increase the number of health care facilities. Majeed (2021), for example, developed a person-speciﬁc
data collection strategy to decrease COVID-19 dissemination. One of their research’s potential contributions is to use
high-computing technologies to provide people with COVID-19-related knowledge in order to promote awareness. The
recommended technique takes security into account when constructing prototype systems for users [49].
Abdel et al. (2021) created an intelligent framework for COVID-19 analysis using disruptive technologies. The
suggested approach, according to the authors, will help in the prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks, preserve the safety of
healthcare staff, and protect patients’ physical and psychological well-being. In response to the medical team’s lack of
personal protective equipment (PPE), the framework was created [26].
According to Sust et al. (2020), disruptive technologies lessen the load on health personnel during the COVID-19
epidemic [50]. Individuals infected with COVID-19 can be monitored utilizing cutting-edge monitoring technologies.
In the instance of COVID-19, public health advocates argue that disruptive technology is essential for public health [51].
However, as the world is struggling to deal with COVID-19, it is assumed that the existing IHC systems are not enough
to handle the situation. As of January 2022, the current COVID-19 infected cases is 307,685,974 [47], ultimately
developing an extended crisis in health care. Thus, researchers and scholars should develop new solutions that might be
more impactful in the current scenario in the health care sector.

4.5 Digital supply chain

The digital supply chain enables the timely and cost-effective delivery of the right product to the right patient [52].
The digital supply chain adds another layer to healthcare systems by lowering costs, reducing needless deviations, and
increasing patient care and involvement. Dau et al. (2019), for example, offer a circular economy transition paradigm to
investigate the healthcare sustainable supply chain 4.0. The proposed paradigm for health-care systems emphasized
social responsibility [53].
During the SARS-COV-2 outbreak, Zahedi et al. (2021) established an IoT-based supply chain network. The proposed
approaches shorten the response time of the ambulance. In addition, the proposed model minimizes the overall crucial
reaction time. In Iran, the proposed supply chain model was tested in real-world scenarios. Over three weeks, the
experimental ﬁndings show that the recommended methods reduced the COVID-19 case by up to 35.54 percent [54].
Fathollahi-fard et al. (2019) develop a bi-objective location-allocation-routing model for a Green Home Health Care
Supply Chain (GHHCSC). The authors introduced ﬁve newly adopted annealing techniques using simulation approaches.
Their ﬁnal result demonstrates satisfactory results regarding the total cost of the system and environmental pollutions.
However, as the proposed approach may not function as expected in recent times due to the ongoing crisis of COVID-19,
yet required to modify the proposed scheme considering additional barriers (i.e., lockdown, transportation delay, route
schedule) [55].
In addition, supply chain-related issues such as inaccurate inventory data, delayed supply allocations, slow repurposing
of manufacturing facilities, and lack of innovations are ongoing challenges that need to be addressed in health care
systems to develop dynamics IHC [56, 57].

4.6 Blockchain technology

Blockchain has various applications in health care. For example, blockchain technology, has the potential to merge
patients’ medical information and prescription data from several locations into a single set of updated records [58, 59].
For example, Rupa et al. (2021) developed an Industry 5.0-based blockchain application to keep medical credentials on
the Remix Ethereum blockchain [60]. Liu et al. (2017) suggested a new blockchain-based approach for a dependable
and efﬁcient medical record exchange system. One of the possible beneﬁts of the suggested model is that it is a
cost-effective technique that allows the user to immediately access the information without compromising security.
However, o ne potential disadvantage is that the research does not address how existing e-health records would be
integrated with the proposed architecture [61].
Christo et al. (2019) advocated blockchain technology as a distributed solution to providing security while accessing
medical reports. The proposed scheme contains authentication, encryption, and data retrieval. The authors claimed that
the proposed framework protects the patients’ records compared to other existing techniques [62].
Kumar et al. (2020) demonstrated a wearable kidney system based on healthcare 4.0 protocols and utilizing blockchain
technology. The author used game theory to design resource-constrained renal systems. The proposed system, according
to the authors, would be an example of the shift away from specialist or departmental-centric methods and toward data
and patient-centric approaches, bringing more transparency, trust, and good practices to the healthcare business [63].

5 Conclusions and remarks

Healthcare professionals have traditionally relied on technology to assist them give the best care to their patients, but
signiﬁcant advances in the previous decade have improved treatment quality and patient outcomes. Health care is
always changing, but one constant remains: the necessity for a secure health care system free of data breaches. Today,
health data may be found in electronic medical records (EMR), personal health records/digital health records, clinical
data repositories (CDR), and health information exchanges (HIE). These archives hold essential information that must
be protected, yet hackers routinely target it. Because hackers are starting to target hospitals, healthcare organizations are
ﬁnding that ensuring their IT infrastructure is intact and working is no longer enough. The fourth industrial revolution
(IR) is the next generation of intelligent healthcare technologies that enable physicians and other professionals to more
effectively manage disease transmission, protect their patients from dangerous illnesses, and receive real-time assistance
when they are most needed. This study included a bibliometric examination of 346 publications on Industry 4.0 and
health care (IHC). According to the conclusions of the survey, Italy is the most prominent country in terms of using
Industry 4.0 in health care, followed by the United Kingdom and China. The three most productive journals in IHC in
terms of total number of articles are IEEE Access, Sensors, and Sustainability. Kumar Satish has been regarded as the
most productive author, with Khan, Li, Park, and Zalud following closely behind. The Technical University of Kosice is
the most proliﬁc institute, followed by the Brno University of Technology and the Chalmers University of Technology,
which are placed second and third, respectively.
Finally, 32 papers were extensively reviewed to provide insights on IHC. IR 4.0 applications include scheduling
difﬁculties, security, COVID-19, digital supply chain, and blockchain technology. However, some unresolved issues,
such as reducing the carbon footprint, improving health care for aging populations, and securing long-term supplies
during the pandemic, need prompt action. Data security, identity, and authenticity are still signiﬁcant concerns in IHC,
according to the referenced research. Researchers and practitioners may consider the limits identiﬁed in this paper
as the area of future research. Future work might include, but is not limited to, explainable machine learning-based
patient records, procedures and ethics for sharing patient data in cloud systems, and efﬁcient machine learning and deep
learning-based resource allocation in health care systems.
