Abstract 

In blockchain, bribery is an inevitable problem since users with various goals can bribe miners by transferring 
cryptoassets. To alleviate the negative effects of such collusion, Ethereum blockchain implemented new 
transaction fee mechanism in the London Fork, which was deployed on August 5th, 2021. In this paper, we first 
filter potential bribery by scanning Ethereum transactions, and the potential bribers and bribees are centralized 
in a small group. Then we construct bribing proxies to measure the active level of bribery and then investigate 
the effects of bribery. Consequently, bribery can influence both Ethereum and other mainstream blockchains, in 
aspects of underlying cryptocurrency, transaction statistics, and network adoption. Moreover, the London Fork 
shows complicated effects on relationship between bribery and blockchain factors. Besides, bribery in Ethereum 
relates to stock markets, e.g., S&P 500 and Nasdaq, implying implicit interlinks between blockchain and 
traditional finance.

1. Introduction 

Blockchain, as a distributed ledger, can execute transactions and update status without a trusted third party. This 
novel property, i.e., decentralization, is regarded as a disruption to centralized power. Benefiting from 
decentralization, many public blockchains have emerged and experienced rapid growth of adoption. In this 
paper, we focus on decentralization in a leading public blockchain, i.e., Ethereum.  

In Ethereum, transactions are validated by miners. Currently, Ethereum applies Proof-of-Work (PoW) 
mechanism to generate consensus (Wood, 2021). In PoW blockchains, to add new blocks, miners need to solve 
complicated mathematical problems, i.e., PoW puzzles, and this process is usually called mining. As a result, 
miners with significant computational power are more likely to be winners of mining, and the powerful miners 
control over validation of most transactions. Then two questions naturally exist in PoW blockchains: is 
blockchain decentralized? What will happen if malicious users collude with dominant miners? 

Centralization in blockchain is undeniable. Theoretically, Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, proposes 
blockchain trilemma, claiming that decentralization, security and scalability cannot coexist in blockchain. 
Empirically, mining centralization exists (Gervais et al., 2014), and powerful miners can launch various attacks 
(Nakamoto, 2008; Teutsch, Jain, and Saxena, 2016; Eyal and Sirer, 2014). Furthermore, miners can exploit their 
power by receiving bribes (Bonneau, 2016), and bribery can be considered as collusion between bribers and 
miners. According to various goals of bribers, bribery can fall into several categories. Adversaries can bribe 
miners to revise the transaction history by forking the blockchain (Liao and Katz, 2017; Daian et al., 2020), and 
such attacks can widely affect users who have executed a series of transactions. Anti-blockchain bribers may 
even attempt to mine consecutive empty blocks (Bonneau, 2016) so they can devalue the blockchain. For bribers 
who focus more on their own interests, their aims include execution of certain transactions (McCorry, Hicks and 
Meiklejohn, 2018) and ignorance of others’ transactions (Nadahalli, Khabbazian and Wattenhofer, 2021). Other 
possible bribery activities are discussed by Winzer, Herd and Faust (2019) and Judmayer et al. (2021a and 
2021b). 

Since collusion between miners and bribers can undermine health of blockchain, Ethereum proposed a new 
transaction fee mechanism in an improvement proposal, namely EIP-1559. The new mechanism aims to refrain 
collusion between miners and users (Roughgarden, 2020), and it was deployed to Ethereum on August 5 th, 2021. 
Usually, the upgrade of Ethereum is called the London Fork, which is regarded as the most significant change to 
Ethereum so far. Leonardos et al. (2021) and Liu et al. (2022) discuss the influence of the London Fork, 
including fee, efficiency and security, however, no empirical analysis of collusion, especially bribery, has been 
presented. To fill the gap between bribery possibility and empirical evidence, this paper detects potential bribery 
in Ethereum, and the varying active level of bribery activities can help to examine practical effects of the 
London Fork. 

To achieve that, we propose innovative methods to detect potential bribes to miners. In practice, it is difficult to 
detect if cryptoassets sent to miners are bribes. So, we filter all transactions that transfer Ether (ETH) to miners, 
since ETH is underlying cryptocurrency in Ethereum. To exact more information, we adopt one-step backward 
tracing to illustrate the circulation of ETH bribes. To summarize, by tracing the transaction history, we can 
extract transactions that include potential bribes to miners. Then, we establish proxies to measure the active 
level of bribery activities. The bribing proxies reflect on both motivations of bribers and efficiency of miners. 
For a briber, they may be more likely to collude with a miner when a certain goal is profitable enough. When a 
goal leads to more profits, a higher bribe will be worthy of attempt. If a briber’s transaction is involved in a 
bribee’s block, the signal of collusion is much stronger. It implies that the transferred ETH might be for 
execution of the certain transaction. On the other hand, the efficiency of bribable miners matters. In our bribing 
proxies, miners’ efficiency is measured by the distance between bribery transaction and a new block validated 
by the bribee. A short distance means that the bribed miner can add a new block quickly after receiving bribes. 
Therefore, for potential bribers, a miner with centralized mining power will be an ideal choice. 

We collect Ethereum data from January 1, 2019 to March 1, 2022. 982,116 transactions and 19,601 blocks are 
filtered, and 150 miners and 829 potential bribers are involved. The maximum of potential bribes is 7,620 ETH, 

 
and the maximum transferred value (in USD) is more than $12.5 million. Comparing to the rapidly growing 
blockchain users, the potential bribers and miners who receive transferred ETH are centralized in a small group, 
while the significant transferred value make these transactions more suspicious. Given the datasets for potential 
bribery, we construct bribing proxies, where varying active level of bribery activities is observed. In some 
blocks, the possibility of bribing is dramatically high, implying that bribery probably exists on these days. 
Moreover, by comparing bribing proxies before and after the London Fork, the active level of bribery 
dramatically decreases after the fork, implying that the new fee mechanism can refrain potentially malicious 
activities. 

To investigate effects of bribery in blockchain, we choose some new categorized factors to capture the status of 
blockchain. Though some studies point several common factors of cryptocurrency (Liu and Tsyvinski, 2020; 
Liu, Tsyvinski and Wu, 2022), these factors are more related to risks and returns. So, our factor selection, e.g., 
network adoption and transaction statistics, can be reference for further research. The empirical framework 
brings forward some interesting findings. First, potential bribes can affect Ethereum and its underlying 
cryptocurrency, i.e., Ether (ETH). For example, higher active level of bribery can lower ETH price and market 
cap, but the transaction volume and the number of active users will be higher. Therefore, the influences of 
bribery can be complex. More interestingly, such complicated influences can be detected in other mainstream 
blockchains. For example, more bribery in Ethereum will lead to more transactions in Bitcoin, and more new 
users will be attracted. However, bribery in Ethereum can negatively affect Bitcoin price and market cap as 
well. These cross-chain effects point that blockchains should not be evaluated as independent markets, and 
beside short-term influences caused by price and volume, user flows among different blockchains may 
undermine the health of blockchains that are affected by vicious activities. Besides, potential bribes show 
interlinks with stock markets. Prices of S&P 500 and Nasdaq will decrease when potential bribes are more 
active, implying opaque but existing interlinks between blockchain and stocks. Previously, Liu and Tsyvinski 
(2020) find that the risk-return tradeoff of cryptocurrencies may not be correlated with stock markets. However, 
more implicit interactions may exist between cryptocurrency market and traditional financial market. 

The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces background, including how Ethereum 
blockchain works and bribery in blockchain. In Chapter 3, we describe how to detect potential bribery and 
construct bribing proxies. The empirical results are presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 gives robustness checks, 
before Chapter 6 concludes. 

2. Background 

2.1 How mining in Ethereum works? 

Ethereum is one of the most influential public blockchains, and the validation of transactions on Ethereum relies 
on a decentralized consensus mechanism, namely Proof-of-Work (PoW). In PoW blockchain, mining is the 
process of adding a new block to the existing blockchain, and the participants are usually called miners. Mining 
resembles competition of computing power. To add new blocks, miners will compete in solving difficult 
cryptographic problems, i.e., PoW puzzles (Atzei, Bartoletti and Cimoli, 2017). Usually, miners with more 
computing power will be more likely to win the mining process, and only the winning miner will be able to add 
the next block and be rewarded. For each block, the rewards include a block reward and transaction fees paid by 
the transaction senders (Liao and Katz, 2017). Table 1 introduces more key variables and jargons in Ethereum. 

PoW mechanism leads to intense competition, and a most widely noticed problem is mining concentration. 
Currently, the most blocks were added by a small group of miners (Gervais et al., 2014). To compete with 
powerful large miners, other individual miners can arrange themselves into “pools”, i.e., mining pools. The 
integrated mining power contributes to a higher possibility of wining the mining process, and once a mining 
pool succeeds to add a new block, the rewards will be proportionally distributed among members. Yet, the 
emergence of mining pools further accelerates mining concentration (Gencer et al., 2018). 

[Table 1 here] 

 
2.2 Transactions on Ethereum 

All actions on Ethereum are executed in the form of transactions. Figure 1 illustrates transaction execution on 
Ethereum. A transaction should be first broadcast to the mempool, which is like waiting area in blockchain. 
Then, miners will group waiting transactions in their blocks. Usually, the decision, including the transactions 
and their order, relies on the attached transaction fee (McCorry, Hicks and Meiklejohn, 2018). The chosen 
transactions will be executed once the block is appended to the existing blockchain. The decision power may 
result in involvement and exclusion of certain transactions, and miners could re-order transactions for their own 
profits (Daian et al., 2020). 

2.3 Bribery in blockchain 

[Figure 1 here] 

As transaction validation is in charge of several most dominant miners, bribery, as a cheaper way to utilize 
mining power, logically exists in blockchain. Given different goals, bribery activities can fall into several 
categories. First, bribers can attempt to fork the current chain for their own interests. For example, in history 
revision bribery, bribers aim to rewrite blockchain history to steal a sizable sum of cryptocurrencies (Daian et 
al., 2020). Second, bribers are willing to pay bribes for transactions that can bring excessive gains (McCorry, 
Hicks and Meiklejohn, 2018). Third, bribers may attempt ignore attacks to exclude some transactions 
(Nadahalli, Khabbazian and Wattenhofer, 2021). Furthermore, the adversary can devalue the blockchain, e.g., 
mining consecutive empty blocks (Bonneau, 2016), by paying enough to miners. There are also other 
possibilities of bribery (Winzer, Herd and Faust, 2019; Judmayer et al., 2021a), and we refer readers to 
Judmayer et al. (2021b) for more details. 

Beside attaching high transaction fees, bribery provides another way to get certain transactions validated. Given 
the limited block size, a natural question is: will be bribery lead to higher transaction fees? Theoretically, 
blockchain is a transaction-processing system, and Huberman, Leshno and Moallemi (2021) argue that miners 
cannot profitably affect fees. Kroll et al. (2013) claim that transaction fees are not even a crucial role in the 
long-run development of blockchain. On the other hand, Easley, O’Hara and Basu (2019) point out that 
transaction fees will be higher since users battle to get their own transactions included. Moreover, after the 
emergence of large mining pools, higher fees will be charged (Cong, He and Li, 2021). Though these papers do 
not address existing bribery, the demand of bribers will make users battle more intense. Therefore, we expect to 
see higher transaction fees when detecting more bribing activities. 

From users’ perspective, blockchain is a queuing system in which users submit transactions and wait for 
validation. Rational users will react to varying waiting time and transaction fees (Hassin, 1995; Kittsteiner and 
Moldovanu, 2005). If bribery exists in a queuing system with decentralized decision making, the system wants 
to get as many bribers as possible, and the higher fee will discourage non-bribers (Lui, 1985). If bribers get 
some priority, then both higher waiting costs and losses caused by bribery can negatively affect honest 
blockchain users. Even though bribers have different goals, the trust of blockchain community will decrease if 
users believe the health of blockchain is undermined (Böhme et al., 2015). So, we conjecture that bribery has 
negative effects on both network adoption of blockchain and transaction demand. Intuitively, users can reduce 
usage of the risky blockchain, and some of them may choose alternative blockchains. So, we expect to observe 
less transaction counts and lower transaction volumes when bribery is more active. Besides, if Ethereum users 
detect malicious bribery activities, they may choose other mainstream blockchains, e.g., Bitcoin. 

Cryptocurrency markets can be probably affected by bribery activities. Recently, risk factors of cryptocurrencies 
attract much attention, and the discussion mainly focus on price- and market-related return predictors (Liu, 
Tsyvinski and Wu, 2022). In this paper, we investigate if certain users, i.e., bribers, can manipulate 
cryptocurrency performance, e.g., price, return, and volume. If such relationship exists, malicious user activities 
can expand characteristics used in investment models of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, interlinks between 
cryptocurrencies and stock markets are also controversial. Liu and Tsyvinski (2020) argue that no direct 
relationship exists between cryptocurrency and stock markets. Since they apply standard textbook tools, on-
chain activities, e.g., bribery, are not used to capture characteristics of cryptocurrencies. If bribery activities in 
blockchain show influence on stock markets, cryptocurrency markets are not isolated but a part of financial 
ecosystem. 

To refrain problems caused by mining concertation and potential collusion related to transaction fees, Ethereum 
proposed the new transaction fee mechanism in a proposal named EIP-1559. Before EIP-1559, the fee 
mechanism is a first-price auction: transaction initiators propose a bid, and miners will get bids of executed 
transactions. In the new transaction fee mechanism, transaction fee will be divided into two parts, including base 
fee and a tip for miner. Once a transaction is validated, the base fee will be burnt, and the miner will only get the 
attached tip. Simply, since users can attach a tip, bribery should be less common under the new mechanism. 
More economic analysis is given by Roughgarden (2020). EIP-1559 was deployed on August 5th, 2021, and the 
upgrade is usually called the London Fork. Empirical studies show that user experience is improved after the 
London Fork since waiting time decreases and estimating fee is easier (Liu et al., 2022). Given the positive 
effects of the London Fork, we expect that bribery is less active after the London Fork, though the effects of 
bribery are unpredictable. 

3. Potential bribes to miners 

3.1 Detection of potential bribes 

Figure 2 illustrates the detection process of potential bribes to miners. Given a 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖 and a step length 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝, 
we examine some blocks prior to 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖. In these blocks, transactions are filtered if their recipient is 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑖. 
Senders of these transactions transfer an amount of value to a miner. Theoretically, any cryptocurrencies can be 
used in bribery (Judmayer et al., 2021b). In this paper, we only consider Ether (ETH), which is the underlying 
cryptocurrency of Ethereum. The attached value of ETH might be bribes, and the senders will be defined as 
potential bribers. In Figure 2, the bribers are 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚1, … , 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑛. 

Next, transactions in 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖 are checked. If potential bribers initiate a transaction in this block, the previously 
sent value is more likely to be bribes. Because the connected transactions imply that a briber first sends some 
value to 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑖, then the briber’s transactions will be involved in 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖.  

The pseduo-code (See Algorithm 1) has three input parameters, i.e., 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘, 𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘, and 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝. The first 
two parameters set up the time interval of Ethereum dataset. 𝑆𝑡𝑒𝑝 defines the number of scanned blocks prior to 
𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖. The output is datasets 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑡𝑜_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖, where 𝑖 ∈ (𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘, 𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘), and the datasets 
include transactions detected as potential bribing. 

[Figure 2 here] 

[Algorithm 1 here] 

3.2 One-step backward tracing 

To better trace potential bribes, we apply on-step backward tracing algorithm. Figure 3 illustrates the general 
idea. Assuming that in 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖 , 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 includes potential bribes, blocks from 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖−1 to 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖−𝑑   will 
be checked. In these blocks, transactions sent to the sender of 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 are selected. More clearly, the 
′ , which illustrates the circulation of 
pattern of connected transactions is ′𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑖 ← 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝐴 ← 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝐵
bribes in form of ETH.  

Here, 𝑑, like the length of scanning window, is the number of checked previous blocks. By setting a short 
scanning window, the traced transactions are more likely related to potential bribing, i.e., transactions in dataset 
𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑡𝑜_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖. Finally, a dataset 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖 will be generated for every 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑡𝑜_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖, where 
𝑖 ∈ [𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘, 𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘]. 

[Figure 3 here] 

3.3. Proxies of active level of potential bribes to miners 

In this section, we measure the active level of potential bribes to miners (referred to as ‘bribing proxy’) on 
Ethereum. We construct proxy benchmark based on transactions that include potential bribes, and proxies A and 
B are calculated by applying one-step backward tracing algorithm. 

 
3.3.1 Proxy benchmark 

Proxy benchmark measures the active level of potential bribes to miners (see Algorithm 2), using output of 
Algorithm 1. The numerator, i.e., 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, reflects on the amount of bribes. Intuitively, higher values to miners 
are more likely to be bribes, and bribing attacks are related to transaction value (Judmayer et al., 2021; 
Somplinsky and Zohar, 2016). 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 also helps to exclude some legal activities. For example, a transaction will 
be automatically generated when a user joins a mining pool. This kind of transactions will not have an attached 
value, i.e., 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 0. Therefore, these transactions will not increase our proxy benchmark.  

The denominator refers to the distance between potential bribes and the block validated by the bribee. With a 
longer distance, the correlation between value transfer and mining is weaker. In other words, the transferred 
value is less likely to be bribes. On the other hand, if the distance is short, the miner can be regarded as a 
‘efficient’ bribee. Once the ‘efficient’ miner receives the bribes, bribers can expect their goal to be quickly 
achieved. 

In the proxy, 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 can reveal a briber’s real purpose to some extent. 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑖 sums up the value of 
transactions initiated by potential bribers in 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖. When a briber executes a transaction in the bribee’s block, 
the possibility of collusion should be different from the basic situation, i.e., no following transactions are 
involved in 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖. The value of transactions in 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖 reflects on the urgency of a user to execute a certain 
transaction. If a user is more urgent, he is more likely to bribe a miner.  

Taken together, a block-level timeseries  𝑝_𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑖 is established, where 𝑖 ∈ [𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘, 𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘]. 
Furthermore, a daily bribing proxy, i.e., 𝑝_𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑡, can be calculated by summing up  𝑝_𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑖 
within a day 𝑡 (see Algorithm 3). 

[Algorithm 2 here] 

[Algorithm 3 here] 

3.3.2 Validation of bribing proxy: one-step backward tracing 

Proxy benchmark is improved by one-step backward tracing. In some cases, potential bribers tend to use a 
private smart contract to collude with miners, instead of directly sending bribes to mining pools (Judmayer et 
al., 2017). To validate the proxy, legitimate transactions should be excluded (See Algorithm 4). 

Combining 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖 with proxy benchmark, Algorithm 5 updates bribing proxies, and a new weight is introduced. 
The new weight can reflect on the relationship between 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑡𝑜_𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖 and 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑖, and it is composed 
of two parts. One is ‘distance’, referring to the difference of block numbers between potential collusion and the 
connected earlier transaction. When two transactions are closer, the transactions are more likely to work for the 
same goal, and the goal of the group of transactions is more suspected.  

The other part of new weight is about transferred value in connected transactions. When the value of a backward 
traced transaction is closer to potential bribes to the miner, the previous one is possible to be related to the 
potential bribing. By tracing prepositive transactions, we can partly conceal the real identity of the briber. The 
structure of our bribing proxies is given in Figure 4. 

[Algorithm 4 here] 

[Algorithm 5 here] 

[Figure 4 here] 

4. Empirical analysis of bribing proxies 

This section summarizes the empirical results of this study. First, we describe the datasets for potential bribes on 
Ethereum and present descriptive statistics of bribing proxies. Then, we perform to investigate the effects of 
potential bribes in Ethereum. We consider both Ethereum and other three mainstream blockchains, including 
Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. For each blockchain, its underlying cryptocurrency, transaction statistics, and 

factors related to network adoption are studied. Besides, interlinks between potential bribes and stock markets 
are also considered. The description of factors is given in Appendix 1. 

4.1 Data sources 

On Blockchair.com, all on-chain transactions in Ethereum are publicly available. Cryptocurrency price, volume 
and market cap data are obtained from Coingecko.com, which aggregates financial data of most 
cryptocurrencies. Besides, IntotheBlock.com and Etherscan.io provide various statistics of mainstream 
blockchains, e.g., statistics of network adoption and transaction volumes. We extract Ethereum data from 
January 1, 2019 to March 1, 2021, including transactions from block 6988615 to block 14303536. 

On August 5, 2021, the London Fork was deployed to Ethereum, meaning that transaction fee mechanism 
significantly changed (Roughgarden, 2020). The new transaction fee mechanism was proposed to alleviate 
collusion between miners and users. Currently, users can pay ‘tips’ to miners, therefore, users can get their 
transactions easily included by setting more ‘tips’. The latest research focus on both theoretical models 
(Leonardos et al., 2021) and basic empirical analysis (Liu et al., 2022), but these findings ignore that users can 
bribe miners by simply transferring cryptocurrencies, which is hard to be refrained by mechanism design. So, in 
each theme of empirical analysis, we will examine the effects of new transaction fee mechanism. 

4.2 Descriptive statistics of bribes to miners 

In our analysis, 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 is 1000, 𝑑 is 6000, and 𝑐 equals to 1. A small 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 is taken in consideration of mining 
concentration. Currently, most blocks are added by a small group of miners, and most of them are mining pools. 
A smaller 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 contributes to excluding some legitimate transactions, for example, a transaction sent to a 
mining pool when a user joins the pool. We select a relatively small 𝑑, meaning that the traced transactions will 
be more likely to relate to potential bribes. 

From January 1, 2019 to March 1, 2022, 982,116 transactions and 19,601 blocks are filtered. The maximum of 
transferred Ether (ETH) is 7620, and the maximum transferred value (in USD) is approximately $12.5 million 
(See Table 2). Since most mining pool does not require a membership fee, these large transferred value is 
noteworthy and abnormal. After applying one-step backward tracing algorithm, we filter 11,352,816 
transactions connected with potential bribes. 

In potential bribing transactions, the participants are concentrated, including 150 miners and 829 potential 
bribers. Table 3 lists 20 most frequently involved miners. Beside leading mining pools, anonymous miners are 
also recognised as potential bribees. Table 4 highlights 20 potential bribers with the highest frequency, including 
mining pools, a smart contract of a crypto exchange, and anonymous users. 

Then, we establish the proxies to measure the active level of potential bribes. Figure 5 shows that the active 
level of potential bribes is usually not very high, while spikes exist on some days, implying that suspicious 
activities may be implemented. By comparing descriptive statistics before and after the London Fork, we find 
that bribery activities are less active after the London Fork, which is preliminary evidence of effects of new fee 
mechanism.  

[Table 2 - 5 here] 

[Figure 5 here] 

4.3 Underlying cryptocurrencies of blockchains 

Ether (ETH) is the underlying cryptocurrency of Ethereum, so the financial factors of ETH may directly relate 
to bribes to miners. To capture the cryptocurrency performance, we consider price, daily return, volume (in 
native units) and market cap (in USD). If ETH is affected by bribery, transactions of other cryptocurrencies 
cannot be immune since ETH is the base payment in Ethereum.  We also consider three underlying 
cryptocurrencies of other blockchains, including Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC). 
Theoretically, some bribing attacks will be implemented using several blockchains (Judmayer et al., 2021a), so 
potential bribes may have cross-chain influence. We estimate the following regressions: 

𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡(10) 

Where: 

𝑖 = {𝐸𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑚, 𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛, 𝐷𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛, 𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛} 

• 
•  𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 = {𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘, 𝐴, 𝐵} 
• 
𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛 = {𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒, 𝑅, 𝑉𝑜𝑙, 𝑀𝑘𝑡𝑐} 
• 
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 = {𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝐶𝑛𝑡, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒, 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑈𝑠𝑑} 

•  𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 = {

0, 𝑡 < 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021
1, 𝑡 ≥ 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021

In our regression models, we choose four control variables, including the number of active addresses, block 
count per day, the average time interval between blocks, and average transaction fee (in USD). The number of 
active addresses is a measurement of network adoption, contributing to cryptocurrency evaluation (Cong, Li and 
Wang, 2021; Sockin and Xiong, 2020). Since scalability of Ethereum might be influential on users’ and miners’ 
decision (Daian et al, 2020), we choose the number of blocks per day as a measurement. Average transaction fee 
(in USD) describes transaction costs. On the other hand, in traditional bribing attacks, bribers can collude with 
users by paying extremely high fees (Liao and Katz, 2017). As for the average time interval between blocks, it 
can reflect on waiting time of users. Theoretically, confirmation time of transactions can be related to bribing 
attacks (Judmayer et al., 2021a; Somplinsky and Zohar, 2016). But it is technically hard to get confirmation time 
for all on-chain transactions. Hence, we choose time interval between blocks to measure how frequent a dozen 
of transactions will be executed in Ethereum. Since both waiting time and transaction fee are publicly 
observable, these two measurements can influence users’ decision. For example, given a certain blockchain, if 
the fee is too expensive, or waiting time is too long, rational users may discard the blockchain. 

Table 6 brings forward some findings for the effects of bribery for ETH and BTC. Overall, all three bribing 
proxies can decrease ETH price and market cap, implying that valuation of underlying cryptocurrency in 
Ethereum will be negatively affected. A possible explanation is that some bribing attacks aim to devalue 
blockchains (McCorry, Hicks and Meiklejohn, 2018), so bribers will manipulate ETH price and market cap to 
weaken the reliability of blockchain. As a result, ETH holders may sell their crypto assets, and potential new 
users will be less likely to join the market. Since bribery seems to undermine health of Ethereum, we are curious 
if the London Fork can alleviate the negative effects of bribery. Surprisingly, though bribery exists under the 
new fee mechanism, the bribing proxies are positively related to ETH price and market price. It is hard to 
explain how bribery increases ETH price and market cap, and our conjecture is that bribers’ aims may change 
after the new fee mechanism. In other words, by implementing unknown on-chain activities, bribers can benefit 
from higher ETH price or market cap. So, the London Fork is not uninfluential, though we need more time to 
observe its long-term effects. Besides, daily return of ETH will be higher when bribery is more active, and the 
effects still hold after the London Fork. This finding makes the bribers’ goals opaquer. 

For the case of BTC, we observe very similar results, showing that BTC price and market cap are affected by 
bribery on Ethereum. The findings are normal that blockchain users may initiate transactions on multiple 
blockchains, so Bitcoin and Ethereum, as two most widely adopted public blockchains, will be common choices 
for investors. The effects of the London Fork on BTC are also consistent with results for ETH, which can be 
further evidence of interlinks between Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

[Table 7 here] 

4.4 Transaction statistics of blockchains 

All on-chain activities are implemented in the form of transactions, and transaction statistics are signals of 
adoption and growth of blockchains.  So, we estimate the following regressions: 

𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡(11) 

   
 
 
Where: 

𝑖 = {𝐸𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑚, 𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛, 𝐷𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛, 𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛} 

• 
•  𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 = {𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘, 𝐴, 𝐵} 
• 
• 

𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛 = {𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑉𝑜𝑙, 𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑈𝑠𝑑, 𝑇𝑥𝑛𝐶𝑛𝑡} 
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 = {𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝐶𝑛𝑡, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒, 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑈𝑠𝑑} 

•  𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 = {

0, 𝑡 < 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021
1, 𝑡 ≥ 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021

Here we consider three transaction-specific statistics, including transaction volume in native units, transaction 
volume in USD, and the number of transactions per day. These three transaction statistics can illustrate both 
scalability and prosperity of blockchain. Hypothetically, if bribery exists in Ethereum and has negative effects, 
users could choose other blockchains, and we will observe varying transaction statistics. To capture such cross-
chain effect, we consider Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. On the other hand, transaction fees are proposed by 
users, though only miners can decide which transactions will be validated. So, if bribers can get their 
transactions executed more easily, transaction fees in blockchain may be affected as well.  

Table 7 shows that transaction volume (in ETH) will increase when potential bribery is more active, but 
transaction count on Ethereum is not affected, implying that normal users do not discard Ethereum because of 
bribery. The finding is not surprising since bribing activities are hard to be detected (Nadahalli, Khabbazian and 
Wattenhofer, 2021). In other words, most blockchain users may not even realized the existence of bribery, 
unless they experience losses caused by bribery. So the transaction volume and transaction count will not be 
negatively influenced. Moreover, the London Fork does not affect positive relationship between bribery and 
transaction volume (in ETH).  

For the case of Bitcoin, the results are different. First, bribing proxies show positive relationship with the 
number of Bitcoin transactions (See Table 8). It is to say, more bribery activities on Ethereum will lead to more 
transactions in Bitcoin. To some extent, Ethereum and Bitcoin are substitutes for each other. If users suspect 
they will suffer from bribery on Ethereum, they will choose to trade on their preferred blockchain. The results of 
Dogecoin are similar (in Online Appendix 2), which validates our conjecture of cross-chain influence of bribery. 
Moreover, the London Fork may not help to refrain the cross-chain effects. For example, we do not observe how 
the fork will weaken the relationship between bribery in Ethereum and Bitcoin transactions. 

[Table 7 – 8 here] 

4.5 Network adoption 

Network adoption is crucial for blockchain, e.g., network effects can influence valuation of cryptocurrencies 
(Sockin and Xiong, 2020). In blockchain, everyone can freely have addresses, which resembles bank accounts 
in traditional finance. One can have as many addresses as they require, and no third party will require any files, 
e.g., identification. If one plan to leave a blockchain, they can simply sell cryptoassets in their addresses and 
stop transactions. Therefore, network factors of blockchain may be highly sensitive to status of blockchain. To 
investigate how bribery relates to network adoption, we estimate the following regressions: 

𝑁𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡(12) 

Where: 

𝑖 = {𝐸𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑚, 𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛, 𝐷𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛, 𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑛} 

• 
•  𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 = {𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘, 𝐴, 𝐵} 
•  𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘 = {𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑒, 𝑁𝑒𝑤, 𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒, 𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒. 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜} 
• 

𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 = { 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒, 𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑉𝑜𝑙, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝐶𝑛𝑡, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒, 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑈𝑠𝑑} 

   
 
 
 
•  𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 = {

0, 𝑡 < 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021
1, 𝑡 ≥ 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021

Here, we consider four network factors, including the number of unique addresses, new addresses, active 
addresses, and the proportion of active addresses to unique addresses. For each blockchain, we consider two 
new control variables, i.e., price of the underlying cryptocurrency and transaction volume (in native units). 
Intuitively, price and volume are signals of performance of blockchain, and users may react to different status of 
blockchain based on their beliefs and preference. For example, users may leave a blockchain when the price of 
its underlying cryptocurrency keep decreasing, or the transaction volume is extremely low. 

For Ethereum, bribing proxies are positively related to active addresses and active ratio, and we give two 
possible explanations. First, since bribes are attached in transactions, the potential bribers will be counted as 
active addresses. On the other hand, other users may implement transactions to defend own profits. For 
example, as explain in Chapter 4.3, potential bribes are related to price and return of underlying 
cryptocurrencies. As a result, rational users will execute different strategies by initiating transactions, though 
they may not realize existence of bribers. After the London Fork, bribery activities show negative effects on 
active addresses in Ethereum, while the relationship between active ratio and bribery is not influenced. If more 
active addresses can be a good signal for blockchain adoption, bribery has more negative influence after the 
London Fork. 

Then, we observe user ‘flows’ among difference blockchains. For the case of Bitcoin, we will observe more new 
users and more active users when bribery is more active in Ethereum. Dogecoin may benefit from bribery in 
Ethereum as well, since active ratio of Dogecoin will be higher with more bribery activites in Ethereum (See 
Online Appendix 3). It is normal again that rational users will tend to use other blockchains, assuming that 
potential bribes may cause losses of normal users. So, malicious activities in one blockchain may have positive 
influence, e.g., better network adoption, on other blockchains. But not all blockchains will benefit from such 
cross-chain effects in all dimensions. For example, when bribery in Ethereum is more common, the unique 
addresses of Dogecoin and Litecoin will decrease. Currently, cross-chain transactions are easier via latest 
technical tools, e.g., Bridge (Ethereum, 2022). It is to say, users can more easily transfer their crypto-assets to 
other blockchains, further enhancing substitutability of blockchains. So, users may have different evaluation of 
co-exising blockchains, and they will join or leave blockchains when Ethereum is not reliable enough. 

4.6 Global stock markets 

[Table 9 – 10 here] 

The interlinks between blockchain and stock markets are not well investigated. Previously, Liu and Tsyvinski 
(2020) argue that risks and returns of cryptocurrency markets are independent on traditional financial market. 
However, in consideration of complexity of blockchain activities, we examine if suspicious activities in 
Ethereum can be related to stock markets. Here, we select four stock indices, including Standard and Poor's 500 
(S&P 500), Nasdaq (NASDAQ), Nikkei 225 (N225), and The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE). We estimate the 
following regression model: 

𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡(13) 

Where: 

𝑖 = {𝑆&𝑃500, 𝑁𝐴𝑆𝐷𝐴𝑄, 𝑁225, 𝑆𝑆𝐸} 

• 
•  𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 = {𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘, 𝐴, 𝐵} 
• 
𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 = {𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒, 𝑉𝑜𝑙, 𝑅} 
• 
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 = {𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒, 𝑇𝑥𝑛𝑉𝑜𝑙, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝐶𝑛𝑡, 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒, 𝐴𝑣𝑔𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑈𝑠𝑑} 

•  𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 = {

0, 𝑡 < 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021
1, 𝑡 ≥ 𝐴𝑢𝑔 5, 2021

   
 
 
   
In regression (13), we use several Ethereum-specific factors as control variables. Ether (ETH) price and 
transaction volume are fundamental signals of blockchain performance. Block count per time and the average 
time between blocks can reflect on the scalability and efficiency of blockchain. Furthermore, the average time 
between blocks and average transaction fees can show the costs, i.e., waiting time and fee, faced by blockchain 
users. Intuitively, agents face a trade-off between stock markets and blockchain. If potential bribes undermine 
profits of non-bribers, these non-bribers may go back to stock markets, or at least execute certain transactions in 
stock markets.  

Table 11 shows that more active bribery is related to lower price of S&P 500 and NASDAQ, while no 
significant results relationship exists in N225 and SSE. After the London Fork, such negative relationship does 
not disappear. Our findings imply that more implicit interlinks exist between Ethereum and stock markets, 
which are different from arguments by Liu and Tsyvinski (2020). However, it is hard to explain why bribery 
activities in Ethereum will lead to lower price of stock indices, implying opaque interactions between 
blockchain and traditional markets. 

5. Robustness checks 

[Table 11 here] 

To bribe a miner, the value of transferred ETH is crucial. Intuitively, a low value of ETH is less likely to be a 
bribe. For that reason, in the datasets of potential bribes, transactions with low value are excluded, and the 
thresholds are 0.1 and 1. We construct proxies again, and the descriptive statistics are given in Table 12. Then, 
we estimate regression models with control variables in Chapter 4, and the results are presented in Online 
Appendix 4. After excluding low-value transactions, most results are consistent with our findings. 

6. Conclusion 

[Table 12 here] 

Given the existing mining concentration, decentralization seems to be impossible in blockchain. Previously, 
both theoretical discussion (Abadi & Brunnermeier, 2018) and empirical evidence (Gervais et al., 2014) show 
that complete decentralization is illusion, and several dominant miners can account for validation of most 
transactions in Ethereum. In this paper, we further investigate another ignored way to exploit centralized mining 
power, i.e., bribery. After scanning Ethereum transaction history, we detect that the susceptive interactions 
between miners and bribers exist, and the circulation of bribes can be more precisely illustrated by tracing 
previous transactions connected with bribery. Since the participants of potential bribery are centralized in a 
small group, the significant amount of transferred cryptocurrency is even more suspicious, which might be 
signals of cooperation between miners and bribers. 

To better illustrate the active level of bribery in Ethereum, we first construct bribing proxies and observe spikes, 
implying bribery is not common but may affect blockchain in certain blocks validated on certain days. Then, we 
investigate the influence of potential bribery in Ethereum, and categorized factor analysis is presented. First, 
ETH, as the underlying cryptocurrency of Ethereum, will have lower price and market cap when bribery is 
active, and such negative influence can be observed in BTC as well, which is a signal of cross-chain effects. 
However, in some aspects, other mainstream blockchains can benefit from bribery in Ethereum. For example, 
more bribery can lead to more Bitcoin transactions and active Bitcoin users. All these cross-chain effects satisfy 
theoretical arguments (Judmayer et al., 2021b), and we argue that blockchains can substitute for each other, 
especially when some malicious activities can undermine health of some blockchains. 

Beside multiple blockchains, users can also invest in traditional finance. We investigate the interlinks between 
potential bribes and four stock indices, while the relationship is complex and opaque. For example, more bribery 
is negatively related to lower prices of S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Though Liu and Tsyvinski (2020) find that the 
returns of cryptocurrencies may not be correlated with stock markets, blockchain can interact with stock markets 
in a more implicit way. Besides, such interlinks may only exist in certain regions. 

 
Our results should be interpreted with their limitations in mind. First, we do not consider transactions that 
transfer other tradable cryptocurrencies on Ethereum. Consequently, a proportion of bribing transaction is 
ignored. Although the detected potential bribes might be less, we do not involve other cryptocurrencies for the 
reason of precise valuation. The exchange rates of cryptocurrencies are rapid-varying, and the rates are not 
completely consistent on different Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes). Technically, it is almost impossible to 
assess the real-time value of cryptocurrencies. 

Second, we (partly) ignore smart contracts specifically written for bribing. A dozen of papers (McCorry, Hicks 
and Meiklejohn, 2018; Judmayer et al., 2021a) propose smart contracts that help bribers to collude with miners 
more conveniently and fairly. It is to say, bribers may not directly transfer ETH to a miner but implement a 
bribe by creating a specific and anonymous smart contract. However, with the bursting growth of smart 
contracts, it is hard to analyse all of them and judge the real purpose of the issuers. So, in this paper, we may 
only capture the crucial part in bribery, i.e., the transaction where miners receive bribes. 

Thirdly, the incentives of bribers and miners are not clear. Some miners may be involved in collusion without 
realizing the briber’s real attention. Since verifying will consume computation power, miners will group 
transactions without verification (Luu et al., 2015). As for incentives of bribers, it is hard to measure their gains 
from a single transaction. Traditionally, bribers attempted to double spend their cryptocurrencies (Bonneau, 
2016), but the intended impact of bribery, such as, transaction ordering, may be more complicated (Judmayer et 
al., 2021b). Furthermore, some of them will only pay bribes after some time (Nadahalli, Khabbazian and 
Wattenhofer, 2021), which makes it more difficult to understand their gains. 

Finally, the long-term influence of potential bribes on Ethereum is still unclear. Though we investigate the 
effects of bribery after the London Fork, bribery may not be eliminated, and new problems may show up. So, 
how to refrain bribery, along with better mechanism design, is worthy of further discussion.

Figure 1. Ethereum blockchain 

Figure 2. Detection of potential collusion in Ethereum 

Note: This figure illustrates the detection of potential collusion. For a given block, e.g., block i, we will examine 
some previous blocks. Transactions sent to miner i, i.e., the miner of block i, will be filtered. The senders of 
these transactions will be regarded as potential bribers. Then, we will check transactions in block i. If potential 
bribers initiate transactions in block i, these transactions will be detected as a part of collusion as well. 

 
 
 
 
Figure 3. The idea of backward transaction tracing 

Note: This figure shows the one-step backward tracing algorithm. Given a transaction detected as potential 
collusion, i.e., a transaction in block i, we will check blocks 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖−1 to 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖−𝑑. Assuming that address A is 
the potential briber, we will filter transactions sent to address A in the corresponding previous blocks. 

Figure 4. The structure of proxies of collusion possibility 

Note: This figure shows the structure of collusion proxies. We have proxy benchmark, proxy A and proxy B. 
Proxy A is developed after applying one-step backward tracing algorithm, and it could reveal more information, 
comparing to proxy benchmark. To calculate proxy B, we delete records without any traced previous 
transactions. 

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Proxies of potential bribes (January 1, 2019 – March 1, 2022) 

 
 
 
Note: This figure illustrates bribing proxies daily (January 1, 2019 – March 1, 2022). In Panel A, we present 
proxy benchmark, while proxy A and B are given in Panel B and C, respectively. Usually, the active level of 
potential bribes is not very high, while spikes exist on certain dates.

Introduction 
Like a part of ledger, a block records some transactions pertaining to the blockchain. 
The ordinal number of a block. For 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖, its block number is 𝑖. 
The participant of mining process. The first one to solve a PoW puzzle can successfully 
add a new block. 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑖, refers to the validator of 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖. 
The start block in our data sample. 
The end block in our data sample. 
Accounts controlled by entities in Ethereum. Each account has a fixed address as the 
identity of the Ethereum account. 
The name of an address. If an address has a public name, it is usually a smart contract of 
a DeFi or mining pool. 
A message with ETH and data from one account to another. 
The sender’s address of a transaction. 
The recipient’s address of a transaction. 
Transferred ETH of a transaction. 
The computational cost of executing a transaction in Ethereum. 
The units of gas actually used in a transaction. 
The amount of ETH the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas. GasPrice is specified by 
the sender.

the transactions detected as potential bribery, we investigate value (in ETH and USD) and transaction fee (in 
Wei and USD). 1 𝐸𝑇𝐻  = 1018 𝑊𝑒𝑖. For the traced transactions that are connected with potential bribery, we 
consider value (in ETH and USD) of transactions.

Note: This table reports regression results. In Columns (1) - (3) of each panel, we run the regression model: 𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 +
𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, using proxy benchmark, A and B, respectively. In Columns (4) – (6), we consider 
control variables in the regression model: 𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, and the 
independent variable 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 is proxy benchmark, A and B, respectively. T-statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and

Note: This table reports regression results. In Columns (1) - (3) of each panel, we run the univariate regression model: 
𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, using proxy benchmark, A and B, respectively. In Columns 
(4) – (6), we consider control variables in the regression model: 𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑖,𝑡 +
𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, and the independent variable 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔 is proxy benchmark, A and B, respectively. T-statistics are 
reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance levels at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels based on the standard t-
statistics.

Note: In this table, we run the regression model: 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝛽2𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽3𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 × 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡. 
In Columns (1) – (3), the dependent variable is price of the stock indice, and we use proxy benchmark, A and B, 
respectively. In Columns (4) – (6), the dependent variable is volume of the stock indice, and we use proxy benchmark, A and 
B, respectively. In Columns (7) – (9), the dependent variable is trading volume of the stock indice, and we use proxy 
benchmark, A and B, respectively. T-statistics are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance levels at the 
10%, 5%, and 1% levels based on the standard t-statistics.

Note: This table reports the descriptive statistics of proxies of the active level of potential bribes. For 
transactions detected as potential bribes, we have two thresholds of value: 0.1 and 1. Then, bribing proxies will 
be calculated after deleting low-value transactions. For example, column ‘benchmark1’ is about proxy 
benchmark after deleting transaction with a value lower than 0.1.
