ABSTRACT
We present a systematic literature review of cryptocurrency and
blockchain research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) pub-
lished between 2014 and 2021. We aim to provide an overview of
the ￿eld, consolidate existing knowledge, and chart paths for future
research. Our analysis of 99 articles identi￿es six major themes: (1)
the role of trust, (2) understanding motivation, risk, and percep-
tion of cryptocurrencies, (3) cryptocurrency wallets, (4) engaging
users with blockchain, (5) using blockchain for application-speci￿c
use cases, and (6) support tools for blockchain. We discuss the fo-
cus of the existing research body and juxtapose it to the changing
landscape of emerging blockchain technologies to highlight future
research avenues for HCI and interaction design. With this review,
we identify key aspects where interaction design is critical for the
adoption of blockchain systems. Doing so, we provide a starting
point for new scholars and designers and help them position future
contributions.

1 INTRODUCTION
First introduced in 2008 as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
[97], blockchain technology has since drawn broad attention from
research and industry alike. A growing body of literature envi-
sions how its decentralized approach can disrupt current business
models, ￿nancial systems, organizations, and civic governance
[33, 34, 68, 121]. Arguably, the most visible evidence of growth
is the combined market capitalization of over USD 1.7 trillion cryp-
tocurrencies have accumulated by January 2022 [23]. Furthermore,
developer activity has been steadily growing over the last decade
[29], multiple projects have been started to improve over the origi-
nal design (e.g. [15, 69, 138, 140]), and blockchain technology has
been explored for a wide range of di￿erent applications and domains
[35]. Through technical innovations, blockchains have advanced
towards performance soon comparable to existing distributed sys-
tems – e.g. the Solana blockchain aims for a throughput of up to
710,000 transactions per second [140].

Despite these improvements, more than a decade after the launch
of the Bitcoin network, blockchain technology seems to be far away
from its envisioned omnipresence. In spite of avid calls from Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI) scholars to engage with blockchain
[35, 45], immature interaction concepts appear to hold back users
with less technological a￿nity and present a barrier for wider adop-
tion: Blockchain applications are hard to get started with [49, 52],
confront both beginners and experienced users with misconcep-
tions [87, 133], and are largely di￿cult to use [132]. While there
have been systematic reviews of blockchain research in adjacent
￿elds – e.g. security and privacy [144], current theories and mod-
els [58], and decentralized ￿nance (DeFi) [92] – there is not yet a
complete overview of HCI research pertaining to blockchain. To
date, Elsden et al. arguably provide the most complete overview,
yet without following a systematic approach and including only lit-
erature up to 2018 [35]. In a ￿eld characterized by rapid innovation,
we thus see the need for a systematic review to understand the past,
present, and future of HCI research on blockchain technology.

The objective of this paper is to develop an overview that can
serve as a starting point when researching and designing with

blockchain technology by showing how the ￿eld developed, map-
ping addressed questions and open challenges. To this end we ask
the following research questions:

•

•

•

How has HCI research on blockchain and cryptocurrency devel-
oped since the inception of Bitcoin?
What themes, challenges, and design knowledge are discussed
in the current research body?
What are gaps that o￿er promising avenues for blockchain re-
search in human computer interaction?

To address these questions, we conducted a systematic review of
articles at the intersection of HCI and blockchain technology. We
identi￿ed 99 relevant articles published between 2014 and 2021.
While the majority has been published at SIGCHI conferences,
there is a long tail of research published elsewhere. We organize the
existing research body into six overarching themes and contrast
them to the evolving blockchain ecosystem. Doing so, we highlight
research opportunities for HCI and argue that interaction design re-
search should boldly adopt modern blockchains as design materials
to explore the creation of interactive decentralized applications.

Contribution Statement: With this systematic review, we make
the following contributions: First, we present a descriptive overview
of current blockchain and cryptocurrency research through an anal-
ysis of publication year, publishing databases, contribution types,
and methodologies. Second, we analyze the existing research body
and consolidate the produced knowledge into six major themes.
Third, we conclude the paper by discussing salient gaps within the
existing body of literature and draw up future research avenues for
HCI and interaction design.

2 METHOD
The focus of this review is to summarize HCI related literature
concerning cryptocurrency and blockchain. We structured the lit-
erature review in four overarching steps, following the PRISMA
systematic review protocol [93]. An overview of our search results
is depicted in Figure 1.

2.1 Step 1: Keyword Search
We selected the ACM Digital Library1, IEEE Xplore2, and Springer
Link3 as initial databases for this review. As a ￿rst step, we con-
ducted a keyword search across all databases. We de￿ned two sets
of search terms: one related to the technology – i.e. blockchain
– and one related to our research ￿eld – i.e. interaction design.
The keywords were chosen by reviewing salient literature pub-
lished at HCI venues (e.g. CHI, DIS, ToCHI) and iteratively re￿n-
ing them. Technology keywords4 included for example "bitcoin",
"cryptocurrency", and "blockchain". Quali￿er keywords5 included

4Technology Keywords: "bitcoin", "cryptocurrency", "crypto currency", "blockchain",
"block chain", "distributed ledger", "dlt", "dapp", "crypto assets". (At the time of our
search "web3" and "nft" did not return any relevant academic results and were therefore
excluded. Given the recent rise of both concepts, future literature reviews may consider
adding them.)
5Quali￿er Keywords: "ui", "user interface", "interaction design", "ixd", "interaction",
"user study", "usability", "ux", "user experience", "prototype", "interface" "interview
study", "user-centered", "user-focused", "focus group", "HCI", "behavior", "end-user",
"design implication", "design recommendation"

for example "user interface", "usability", and "design implication".
We then computed query strings with pairwise combinations of
technology and quali￿er keywords and ran them against each of
the databases. A publication would be included in our keyword
search if either of the ￿elds "title", "abstract", or "author keywords"
matched against the pairwise combination. An abstract example of
a query string would looks as follows: "(title: keyword1 OR abstract:
keyword1 OR author_keywords: keyword1) AND (title: keyword2 OR
abstract:keyword2 OR author_keywords:keyword2)". We conducted
the search in July 2021 and did not restrict the search to a speci￿c
timeframe. We included all papers published before July 31, 2021
— the date of our search. The keyword search resulted in a total
of 1,362 papers. Additionally, we iteratively conducted a forward
search with Google Scholar6 for all publications included in the
review resulting in an additional 51 papers.

2.2 Step 2: Screening Relevant Publications
In the second step, we screened the title and abstract of all 1,362
publications to identify those relevant for the review. We eliminated
papers based on the following exclusion criteria:

Publications with no blockchain or cryptocurrency focus
Publications with no HCI focus (e.g. technical prototypes)
Publications written in a language other than English
Duplicates

•

•
•
A particularly high fraction of excluded publications can be at-
tributed to keyword matches against "prototype" or "blockchain",
resulting in technical prototypes without consideration of user
interaction. In some situations, it was not apparent whether the
exclusion criteria were met solely by looking at the title and ab-
stract. In these situations, we included the publication for a full-text
review in the next step to not miss relevant literature. In total 156
publications were reviewed – initially 105 to which 51 were added
throughout the forward search process. All selected publications
were downloaded for analysis in the next step.

Publication Type columns, and means for the Metrics columns. Citations numbers were retrieved from Google Scholar on December
20, 2021.

2.3 Step 3: Identifying Eligible Publications
In a ￿nal step, we reviewed the full text of the remaining publica-
tions. The eligible papers underwent more rigorous scrutiny based
on the same exclusion criteria mentioned above, resulting in a ￿nal
set of 99 papers.

average paper length (from 5.0 pages in 2014 to 12.1 pages in 2021)
and the average number of authors contributing to a paper (from
4.0 authors in 2014 to 4.6 pages in 2021). The average paper has
been cited 25.1 times. Not surprisingly, earlier publications show
higher numbers of citations.

2.4 Step 4: Qualitative Analysis
The 99 publications included in the review were read in full. In
several iterations, the papers were analyzed and assigned codes.
This information was entered into a database for further analysis.
Throughout the process, publications were primarily coded by the
main author and discussed for validation among the co-authors.
Following a thematic analysis approach [12] the coded data was
organized along initial emerging themes. In multiple rounds, these
themes were revised, and the papers were re-coded until saturation
was reached.

3 OVERVIEW
We included 99 publications in our review. Table 5 – located in the
appendix – provides an overview of all included publications. For
better accessibility, a spreadsheet of the table is included in the
supplementary material. Table 1 provides an overview aggregated
by publication year, library, publication type, and descriptive metrics
of the papers. This review covers in total 8 years: The ￿rst included
publication dates back to 2014, 6 years after the original Bitcoin
whitepaper [97] was published. From then the number of publi-
cations increased year over year, peaking at 28 in 2019, slightly
decreasing to 26 in 2020. These increases in scienti￿c publications
seem to be aligned with the crypto-hype-cycle peaks in 2013 and
2017, drawing in not only capital, startup activity, and developer
activity [29], but as it appears also research interest.
The ACM Digital Library is the most relevant source with 52 (53%)
publications, followed by IEEE and Springer. In total, eleven publi-
cations were identi￿ed from other databases (e.g. USENIX, Elsevier)
using forward search. Only three venues have more than ￿ve pub-
lications attributed to them: CHI (21), DIS (7), and PACMHCI (5).
A long-tail of 42 venues shows only one publication, indicating a
fragmented ￿eld. Most work is published at conferences (78%), with
journal publications only emerging over the past four years. The
maturing of the ￿eld is also re￿ected by the steady increase of the

3.1 Two Perspectives: Blockchain or

Cryptocurrency

We noticed that publications in our sample adopted one of two per-
spectives. Either they framed their research investigating blockchain
technology (59, 60%) or cryptocurrency (40, 40%). Cryptocurrency
publications mainly revolve around understanding users’ moti-
vation, perceived risks, and overall perception as well as users’
interaction with wallets. Articles about blockchain focus on the
design and development of blockchain-based systems for speci￿c
use-cases and their subsequent e￿ects on users and society. The
majority of empirical studies dealing with people evolve around
cryptocurrency, whereas contributions about blockchain frequently
contribute artifacts or system evaluations.

Among the 40 publications discussing cryptocurrencies in our
corpus, 32 addressed Bitcoin, in eight cases the currency was not
speci￿ed. This was, for example, the case when researchers explored
the usability of di￿erent currency exchanges (e.g. [49, 64]). Among
the 58 publications discussing blockchain, 13 addressed Bitcoin [97],
19 Ethereum [15], and six other blockchains such as IOTA [106]. 27
did not state a speci￿c cryptocurrency. This was, for example, the
case for publications surrounding interface prototypes (e.g. [11]) or
design workshops (e.g. [32]).

3.2 Contribution Types
We coded all publications with regards to the contributions they
were making, using the classi￿cation proposed by Wobbrock and
Kientz [137] (see Figure 2). The majority of contributions are of
empirical nature. In total 73 (74%) publications contribute either
an empirical study that tells us about how people use a system (44
publications) or an empirical study that tells us about people (29
publications). 39 publications (38%) contribute an artifact or system.
We included functional systems (e.g. [124, 129]) and interface or in-
teraction prototypes (e.g. [9, 48]) under this category and excluded
physical design kits (e.g. [72, 111]). Only few publications make

methodological (2, 2%), theoretical (4, 4%), dataset (1, 1%), or system-
atic literature review (3, 3%) contributions. Eight publications (8%)
contribute an essay or argument.

Figure 2: Contributions types made by publications in our
sample.

3.3 Used Methods
We analyzed the research methods used across the included pa-
pers (see Figure 3). Several publications combined methods in their
studies. We grouped the used data collection methods into six cate-
gories:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Quantitative data analysis includes the analysis of secondary
data such as log data (e.g. [41]), content analysis of forums and
websites (e.g. [77]), or app reviews (e.g. [133]).
Interviews include interview studies as primary source of data
collection (e.g. [50, 51, 70, 115]) as well as interviews comple-
menting evaluations of systems (e.g. [38, 79, 123]).
Questionnaires include data collection through questionnaires
as primary source of data collection (e.g. [2, 79]) as well as com-
plementing other forms (e.g. [11, 143]).
Lab studies include studies conducted in a lab environment
in which rich data (e.g. screen-, video-, audio-recordings) could
be collected. For example, usability studies (e.g. [8, 48, 104]) or
heuristic evaluations through experts (e.g. [65]).
Field studies, in contrast, include studies that are conducted
in the natural environment of users. For example, ethnographic
studies (e.g. [61, 62]) and deployed mobile applications (e.g. [11])
or systems (e.g. [40, 122]).
Workshops include design research methods engaging groups
of people in an e￿ort to elicit design knowledge about people,
speci￿c systems, or speculative imaginaries (e.g. [37, 68, 111]).

Figure 3: Method types used by publications in our sample.

The most used methods for data collection are interviews (25, 25%),
lab studies (24, 24%), and questionnaires (18, 18%.) 51 publications
report use of a single data collection method whereas 24 publica-
tions made use of method triangulation [105] by combining two
or more types. For example, Tallyn et al. combined the analysis of
log data and interviews during a ￿eld study deployment of an au-
tonomous co￿ee machine [122]; Bidwell et al. used questionnaires
and log data in a longitudinal ￿eld study to evaluate automated
conditional giving [11]; Jabbar et al. used interviews and ethno-
graphic observation to understand blockchain assemblages [62].
Looking at generative methods, there are several e￿orts to elicit
design knowledge about blockchain systems in workshops, many
of which make use of novel design kits [72, 88, 90, 111]. Most pub-
lications contributing artifacts – either in the form of interface pro-
totypes or functional systems – present systems using blockchain
to implement application-speci￿c use cases (22 publications, e.g.
conditional giving [129], energy trading [116], or last mile delivery
[123]) or support tools (nine publications, e.g. visual smart contract
construction [125], or tools for transaction analysis [75]).

4 MAJOR THEMES
After providing an overview of blockchain research in the HCI
community, we present and discuss salient themes that emerged as
we reviewed the papers. We identi￿ed 6 major themes: (1) the role
of trust, (2) understanding motivation, risk, and overall perception
of cryptocurrencies, (3) explorations surrounding the usability of
cryptocurrency wallets, (4) engaging users with blockchain, (5) us-
ing blockchain for the implementation of speci￿c use-cases, and (6)
designing support tools for blockchain systems. Figure 4 visualizes
the included publications over time per theme.

4.1 Trust in a Trustless System
A central feature of blockchain systems are their trustlessness – i.e.
the fact that decentralized actors can agree on a common valid state
of the systems without the need to trust a central entity or each in-
dividual actor within the system. Several HCI publications address
trust and the trustworthiness of blockchain and cryptocurrency sys-
tems. This strand of research particularly challenges the assumption
that blockchains are trustless and argues to adopt a sociotechnical
perspective [25, 26, 53, 76, 82, 84, 116] as trust in algorithms cannot
entirely substitute trust in humans [85]. Investigating the role of
trust and how to design trustworthy systems is viewed as partic-
ularly important to understand the adoption or non-adoption by
users [26, 131]. Figure 5 provides a visual overview.

4.1.1
Factors Influencing Trust in Blockchain Systems. Sas and
Khairuddin were the ￿rst to integrate trust and blockchain in the
context of HCI [70, 114, 115]. Drawing from established models
of trust, they discuss the roles of technological trust, social trust,
and institutional trust and conclude that established models fail to
adequately address decentralized systems. They propose a research
framework for HCI to explore trust along three layers and highlight
users, merchants, miners, exchanges, and governments as relevant
stakeholder groups for Bitcoin [114]. In the context of Bitcoin they
de￿ne technological trust as people’s trust in Bitcoin technology ex-

each other, and institutional trust as the trust of governmental in-
stitutions in Bitcoin technology ([114], p. 340). In subsequent work
they explore both users’ [115] and miners’ trust perceptions [70]
through qualitative interviews. The remaining papers subsumed
under this theme primarily address end-users as stakeholder group.
An exemption is the work by Voskobojnikov et al. who surveyed
204 non-users to investigate factors in￿uencing the adoption of
cryptocurrencies. Their results show that trust is a critical factor
a￿ecting adoption intention [131].

While Sas and Khairuddin’s framework has found limited adop-
tion among the sampled papers, we use it in the following to or-
ganize the trust building factors identi￿ed by research. Looking at
factors that can be attributed to technological trust, we ￿nd several
publications. Using a quantitative research design, Wallenbach et al.
￿nd that immutability and the traceability of information positively
in￿uence the trust in the technology. In contrast, the anonymity of
a blockchain has a negative in￿uence [134]. These results con￿rm
the tension arising from having an open and decentralized, yet
anonymous system, reported by Sas and Khairuddin [114]. Ooi et
al. identify technical protections, transaction procedures, and secu-
rity statements as determinants of perceived trust for Bitcoin [102].
Looking at social trust, Heidt identify trust in code, in data, in a
project’s vision, and systemic trust in the interplay between these
factors to be relevant for design [53]. Craggs et al. emphasize the
role of interpersonal trust in cryptocurrency communities, particu-
larly interpersonal trust in other users and interpersonal trust in the
maintainer of the network [26]. Additionally, several papers report
the negative e￿ect of illicit activities [115, 131] on trust in cryp-
tocurrency systems. We did not identify any publications focusing
on the trust relationship governmental institutions have towards
cryptocurrencies or other blockchains. However, we noticed that

a lack of trust in established institutions is a common theme men-
tioned by cryptocurrency users when asked why they are drawn
to the space (e.g. [50, 71, 76, 79, 115]). Also dubbed "the paradox of
unregulation", there are qualitative accounts arguing both for and
against regulation of cryptocurrenies as a means to foster trust in
cryptocurrencies [51, 70, 115, 132].

4.1.2 Trust Challenges. Grounded in the multifaceted factors iden-
ti￿ed to in￿uence trust, scholars highlight di￿erent challenges.
Between merchants and buyers, users face the risk of dishonest
traders [115] as only one side of the transaction is recorded on
the blockchain. The pseudonymous nature of transaction poses a
challenge to establish trust over time. To mitigate this challenge
social strategies are suggested (trade with authorized exchanges,
socially authorized traders, reputable traders, or de-anonymized
traders) and researchers call for technical advancements (e.g. to
support two-way transactions and reversible transactions) [115].
We found that across several publications a lack of knowledge
and experience of blockchain technology by most users is men-
tioned as reason for missing trust [20, 76, 82, 142]. Users with
limited understanding have di￿culties establishing (technological)
trust [82]. For the adoption of centralized payment systems the
reputation of the provider plays an important role (see e.g. [44]
for Apple Pay). In the case of cryptocurrencies there is no central
authority to trust. Because of that social elements gain importance,
elevating, for example, the role of communities [116]. Knittel et
al. report at the example of the Reddit r/bitcoin forum that the
ideology within the community reduces interpretive complexity
and supports collective imaginaries of a positive Bitcoin future [76].
On the technological side of the spectrum, trust in data remains
an unsolved challenge. While data on the blockchain is immutable,

the correctness of the data written on the blockchain cannot be
veri￿ed easily (also known as oracle problem) [20]. Trust in rep-
utable intermediaries to connect the real-world with the blockchain
is thus necessary [20].

Finally, Bitcoin miners face additional trust challenges, speci￿-
cally related to the fair distribution of mining rewards when con-
tributing their mining power to a mining pool [70]. Beyond this we
did not ￿nd other research addressing miners or validators.

4.1.3 Designing Trustworthy Systems. Several publications imple-
ment interfaces or functional systems to facilitate trust in blockchain
systems. Lee et al. explore how a chatbot is used both as an ob-
ject and mediator of trust and highlight the arising sociotechnical
trust gap. At the example of the chatbot they argue that trust in a
known technology (i.e. a chatbot interface) can mediate trust in an
unknown technology (i.e. cryptocurrency) [82].

Drawing on the results of their quantitative study, Voskobojnikov
et al. recommend to focus designing for situational normality to
establish trust: Crypto-assets providers should mimic established
payment systems users are already familiar with and provide stable-
coins (cryptocurrencies that track the value of existing ￿at cur-
rency) to lower the entry barrier [131]. Some scholars recommend
the use of trust-supporting design elements in interfaces, such as
trust-labels issued by known institutions such as exchanges [131],
governments [142], or blockchain consortia [142].

4.2 Cryptocurrency: Motivation, Risk, and

Perception

The second salient theme surrounds the exploration of the experi-
ences and perceptions of cryptocurrency users. It is noticeable that
publications in this cluster overwhelmingly focused on cryptocur-
rency users, not blockchain users. The large majority of publications
focuses on Bitcoin and generalizes to cryptocurrencies. Figure 6
provides a visual overview.

4.2.1 Motivation. Several studies investigate the underlying mo-
tivation of why people are interested to engage with cryptocur-
rencies. While there is no established taxonomy, similar themes
have been reported across studies. Froehlich et al. group users’
motivation into ￿nancial interest, ideological interest and technical
interest [50]. Abramova et al. present quantitative results separated

by user groups, with ￿nancial gain and interest in the technology
being the most important self-reported motives across all groups
[2]. Similar motives are reported by Sas and Khairuddin [71, 115]:
the oncoming monetary revolution, empowerment associated with
the use of a decentralized cryptocurrency, perceived material value,
and an economic rationale. Krombholz et al. report curiosity and the
decentralized nature as motivators [79]. Voskobojnikov et al. take a
di￿erent approach and investigate motivations and reasons against
cryptocurrency adoption [131]. Contrary to qualitative reports by
Gao et al. [51], they only ￿nd an indirect negative e￿ect of self-
e￿cacy on adoption intention. Among non-users, association with
illicit activities, a lack of regulation, and the belief that Bitcoin’s
value has peaked were also reported to hold them back [132].

4.2.2 Behavior and Perception. Several studies attempt to increase
knowledge on how cryptocurrency users are behaving and how
their perception in turn in￿uences behavior. There are multiple qual-
itative and quantitative studies reported. Common methods include
questionnaires (e.g. [2, 79]), interview studies (e.g. [50, 51, 115]),
and content analysis of forums and other data sources (e.g. [41, 76]).
Quantitative studies provide insight into the demographic compo-
sition of cryptocurrency user base. Table 2 provides and overview.
There are samples from di￿erent continents available. While the
speci￿c ratio shifts between studies, there are substantially more
male participants than female ones. This skew is acknowledged by
most authors, but we were not able to ￿nd any attempt explaining
why women are less prevalent. The reliability of these demographic
variables should be taken with a grain of salt as all studies adopt a
targeted sampling procedure.

quantitative empirical studies.

Figure 6: Overview of publications assigned to the Cryptocurrency: Motivation, Risk, and Perception theme.

Several studies report general usage behavior related to cryptocur-
rencies. Most do not distinguish between di￿erent cryptocurrencies
or types of tokens; those that do limit their focus almost exclusively
on Bitcoin. Users typically own more than one cryptocurrency
[2, 79] and use di￿erent types of wallets in parallel [50] – a recent
analysis of Abramova et al. shows that 80% have more than one
type of wallet to manage their cryptocurrency [2]. Krombholz et al.
provide additional insight into backup behavior [79]. With a mixed
methods approach Busse et al. examine payment cultures in four
countries (US, Germany, Iran, China), ￿nding higher penetration
of cryptocurrencies in western countries [14].

While Bitcoin is titled a currency, researchers have raised the
question whether it is actually being used like one [89]. While Sas
and Khairrudin report that most participants use Bitcoin primarily
as store of value [115], Gao et al. ￿nd support for both investment
and currency [51]. Froehlich et al. distinguish between use as money
(i.e. as medium of transaction) and use as asset (i.e. as store of value
or investment) and argue for designers to focus on either one use
case to build more usable applications [50] .

Knittel et al. provide a deep qualitative analysis of the r/bitcoin
community on Reddit7 [76, 77]. They ￿nd that forum users sub-
scribe to a "True Bitcoiner" ideology, consisting of three core beliefs:
(1) viewing Bitcoin’s technology as more trustworthy than its people,
(2) rejecting ‘corrupt’ social hierarchies related to money, and (3) the
importance of accumulating or "HODLing" quantities of Bitcoin as a
strategy to create an ideal future ([76], p. 1). With a similar approach
Jahani et al. try to disentangle processes of collective sense making
related to emerging cryptocurrencies in forums [63]. Most Bitcoin
users are not mining Bitcoin themselves [51, 79]. Khairuddin and
Sas provide qualitative insights into the practices of Bitcoin min-
ers, considering individual and collective approaches (solo-miners,
collaborative mining pools, data-centers) [70].

Kra￿t et al. investigate how peer-in￿uences a￿ect user behavior
on cryptocurrency exchanges. With a novel experimental approach
they ￿nd that already low-value transactions a￿ect buying behavior.
They hypothesize about the role of user interface design elements
(e.g. price history, tickers charts, price direction indicators) on col-
lective behavior [78]. Being one of the few studies focusing on

7https://reddit.com/r/bitcoin (last-accessed 2022-02-18)

Ethereum, Faqir et al. analyze the e￿ect of gas price surges on user
activity in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). De-
spite major surges in transaction fee costs in the analyzed time
frame, they ￿nd only a minor in￿uence on user activity [41].

4.2.3 Risks, Security, and Privacy. Connected to the overall per-
ception of cryptocurrencies are the questions which risks users
are exposed to, how they perceive them, and how they ultimately
deal with them. These questions are particularly interesting in the
context of blockchain systems, as many security-related tasks are
shifted to the end user.

The most recent and arguably the most rigorous work surround-
ing risk perceptions and security behaviors of cryptocurrency users
is presented by Abramova, Voskobojnikov, Beznosov, and Böhme
[2, 131, 132]. Particularly, their CHI 2021 publication [2] is worth
mentioning for three reasons. First, they connect to and synthesize
15 prior empirical studies o￿ering an excellent starting point for
new scholars in this ￿eld. Second, they thoroughly ground their
study in theoretic underpinnings (the Protection Motivation The-
ory [112], the Theory of Planned Behavior [4], and the Technology
Acceptance Model [27, 83]). And third, they combine a broad and
deep sampling strategy to collect their data. Based on their survey
results, they identify three distinct clusters of crypto-asset users –
cypherpunks, hodlers, and rookies.

Risks. Engaging with cryptocurrencies requires users to deal
with di￿erent risks. Abramova et al. surveyed cryptocurrency users
about their perceived risk of being extorted, theft of private keys,
loss through own mistakes, vulnerabilities of wallets, and vulnera-
bilities of exchanges [2]. Sas and Khairuddin highlight users’ risks
surrounding lost passwords, malicious attacks, dishonest trading
partners, and failure to recover from human error or malice [115].
Building on their work, Froehlich et al. synthesize three essential
risk categories: (1) the risk of human error, (2) the risk of betrayal,
and (3) the risk of malicious attacks [50]. Across studies self-induced
human errors are frequently reported (e.g. [2, 47, 50, 79, 87, 132]).
Examples include forgotten passwords [115], forgotten storage loca-
tions, lost private keys, wrongly sent transactions [50], or ill invest-
ment decisions [2]. Risks of betrayal result from users misplacing
trust in a third party [50], such as exchanges that fail to adequately

To appear in DIS ’22, June 13-June 17, 2022, Virtual Event, USA

Froehlich et al.

protect their customers cryptocurrency. Examples for malicious be-
havior are also well documented: dishonest traders [115], extortion
[2], theft [2, 79], and vulnerable wallets or exchanges [2].

Interestingly, Voskobojnikov et al. ￿nd no signi￿cant e￿ect of
perceived risk on adoption intention. They reason that both users
and non-users are most-likely aware of the most common risks
[132]. Mai et al. ￿nd that while users are indeed able to explain a
broad spectrum of risks, they often have incomplete or inaccurate
mental models of how cryptocurrencies work [87]. Frequent miscon-
ceptions concern key management (who generates a key, how are
transactions signed, that private keys should not be exposed) [87],
what cryptocurrency addresses are [49, 87], transactions and fees
(particularly how fees and transaction speed relate) [49, 50, 87, 133],
and anonymity as well as security aspects [79, 87].

Security and Privacy Personas. Risk and security perceptions
likely di￿er between individuals and it is reasonable to assume
that cryptocurrency users are not a homogeneous group [2]. While
studies try to distinguish between non-users [51, 131], beginners
[48, 49], and cryptocurrency users [79, 102, 115], Abramova et al. are
the ￿rst to de￿ne a typology of cryptocurrency users using an em-
pirical approach [2]. They build on the concept of privacy personas
[31, 80], a model distinguishing users based on their motivation
and knowledge about security and privacy into ￿ve personas [31].
Froehlich et al. ￿rst connected privacy personas with user behavior
in the cryptocurrency domain, suggesting that both knowledge
and motivation about secure behavior would in￿uence their risk
perception. For example, fundamentalists (high knowledge, high
motivation) would perceive a low risk of human error and value
self-managed wallets over custodial ones. At the opposite side of
the spectrum, the marginally concerned (low knowledge, low mo-
tivation) would prefer custodial wallets as they would perceive a
higher risk of human error [50]. Abramova et al. applied hierarchi-
cal clustering on a sample of 395 participants and identi￿ed three
robust clusters of users – cypherpunks, hodlers, and rookies. These
personas di￿er in their security and privacy behavior. For example,
cypherpunks rather opt for self-managed systems, whereas hodlers
and rookies need to decide between custodial or self-managed
wallets [2]. Their work may provide a valuable starting point for
researchers who want to obtain a deeper understanding of user
groups in cryptocurrency. Along with their analysis they also pub-
lished the survey instrument they used to collect their data.

4.3 Cryptocurrency: Wallets
Wallets are the entrypoint to engage with blockchain applications
and the cryptoeconomy at large.

We identi￿ed 16 publications which deal with the user experience
or usability of wallets. Most publications present empirical results
generated by evaluating one or several existing cryptocurrency
wallets or exchanges [5, 8, 49, 64–67, 94, 109], or collected data
through questionnaires [2, 79] and interview studies [50]. While
most publications highlight challenges, usability issues, and pro-
vide recommendations to address them, hardly any implement
and evaluate the proposed improvements. Surprisingly, only three
publications contribute generative design artifacts: Froehlich et al.
develop and evaluate onboarding ￿ows to improve two wallets for
beginners [48], Chen et al. present a prototype of an augmented

reality cryptocurrency wallet [18], and Dlamini present a wallet for
low cost mobile phones [30]. Beyond cryptocurrency wallets, we
were surprised to ￿nd only one article focusing on decentralized
applications (dApps) on the web [81]. Figure 7 provides a visual
overview.

4.3.1 Wallet Usability. Several publications attempt to categorize
wallets. Krombholz et al. initially present ￿ve categories related to
key management and introduce the term "Coin Management Tool
(CMT)" as synonym for wallet [79]. Froehlich et al. follow suit and
distinguish between two categories: Custodial wallets, where a third
party takes care of key management for users and self-managed
wallets (also called non-custodial wallets [133]), where the user is
in full control of and has full responsibility over key management
[50]. Moniruzzaman et al. distinguish between mobile, hardware,
paper, and web wallets [94]. In a similar fashion Voskobojnikov
et al. distinguish software, mobile, hardware, paper, cloud, multi-
signature, and brain wallets as well as exchanges [133]. Empirical
studies reveal that most users have several types of wallets [2, 50,
79]. Custodial wallets are generally believed to be less secure, but
more convenient to use for beginners [50, 133]. Scholars recommend
the use of software wallets which are connected to the internet for
use cases with frequent interactions, and more secure self-managed
wallets for the long term storage of larger amounts [39, 50, 79].
Studies in our sample address custodial wallets [48, 49, 67, 109],
self-managed wallets [5, 50, 133], decentralized exchange [64–66],
or do not explicitly distinguish between them [2].

Wallets on desktop devices [5, 67, 109] and on mobile phones
[18, 30, 48, 64–66] are looked at. Two studies address both desktop
and mobile devices [49, 94]. One study looks into the usability and
security of a hardware wallet [5]. There are several studies which
focus explicitly on beginners or new users [8, 48, 49, 67]. Addi-
tionally, some studies engage with participants without any prior
experience [64–66]. Surprisingly, we have not found any studies
that evaluate the usability of wallets longitudinally. Table 3 pro-
vides and overview of typical tasks used to evaluate cryptocurrency
wallets in lab studies.

While cryptocurrency wallets at large have not been attested great
usability [5, 8, 49, 59, 64, 67, 94, 133], there are also a few examples
suggesting that it is not impossible to develop usable cryptocur-
rency wallets: The best performing wallet in the heuristic evalua-
tion of Moniruzzaman et al. has a task success rate of 97.3% [94].
Froehlich et al. report a SUS score [13] of 70 for one evaluated
custodial wallet [49] and are able to improve the perceived usability
of another wallet by designing an onboarding process [48].

4.3.2 Generalizable Design Insights. Most publications present us-
ability evaluations speci￿c to the wallets they analyze [5, 18, 30, 64–
67, 94, 109]. Only few publications aim at producing generalizable
design insights about cryptocurrency wallets [2, 8, 48–50, 133]. For
scholars new to the ￿eld, the most complete overview of usability
challenges of cryptocurrency wallets is probably found in the works
of Froehlich et al. [49] and Voskobojnikov et al. [133].

Froehlich et al. present the results of a qualitative user study with
34 novice users who engaged with custodial wallets for the ￿rst
time. Using three di￿erent wallets, they identify several challenges
that new users face when ￿rst interacting with cryptocurrencies
and group them into three categories: user interface challenges,
￿nance challenges, and cryptocurrency challenges [49]. The work by
Voskobojnikov et al. complements these ￿ndings. They analyze app
store reviews of self-managed wallets, identifying 6,859 reviews
relating to user experience issues. Their thematic analysis suggests
that both new and experienced users struggle with a range of issues:
Con￿rming results from a similar analysis of ￿nance apps [59],
mobile cryptocurrency apps at large still su￿er many shortcomings
related to user experience [133]. Voskobojnikov et al. distinguish
in their analysis between General UX Issues and Domain Speci￿c
UX Issues that are closer related to cryptocurrencies. We adopt this
perspective to collate the design challenges and recommendations
across the reviewed papers in the following.

4.3.3 General User Experience Issues. Across the analyzed papers
there are many issues and shortcomings that are not unique to cryp-
tocurrency wallets. While not unique, they become more severe
given the direct involvement of money and the irreversible nature
of cryptocurrency transactions [49, 133]. For example, Voskobo-
jnikov et al. report a case where poor interface design resulted in
direct monetary loss when a user sent a transaction multiple times
[133]. Performance issues, freezes, crashes, outdated protocol imple-
mentations, and blocking user interfaces are being reported by app
reviewers [132]. Di￿erent issues related to the structure and func-
tionality of user interfaces are being reported across publications:
Poor layout and structure of the interface [5, 49], ambiguous system
status or inaccurate information [49, 133], and a general lack of
guidance [49, 87, 133]. Additionally, issues pertaining to technical
jargon [87, 94], confusing iconography and naming [49, 64, 133],

typos [133], color schemes [133], and ill-designed error messages
[49] are common. Another issue reported by Froehlich et al. in
the context of custodial wallets concerns the extended sign-up or
veri￿cation process, often required by regulation [49, 133]. They re-
port that anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer
(KYC) procedures often feel invasive for users, are error prone, dis-
rupt the user experience through context and device switches, and
sometimes lead to confusion about the legitimacy of an app [49].
The prevalence of these issues suggests that the below average
usability of cryptocurrency apps (e.g. reported by [49, 59]) might
only partly related to technical aspects of cryptocurrencies. This
consequently means that many of these issues can be addressed by
following established design guidelines [49, 133].

Voskobojnikov et al. emphasize the importance of error recovery
[98, 133] and advise practitioners to design for situational normality
by mimicking existing online banking or payment systems users are
already familiar with [133]. Other scholars draw similar examples to
existing ￿nance applications [49, 64]. Additional recommendations
include designing for transparency and control [87, 116], focusing
on the promotion of cryptocurrenies’ bene￿ts [67], supporting
users’ learning experience [49, 116] and designing for fun use [51].

4.3.4 Domain Specific User Experience Issues. The second cate-
gory of issues directly relates to the cryptocurrency domain. Issues
under this category result either from the user interface and appli-
cation design or from misconceptions of users. While the former
can be addressed through better design, misconceptions can only
be addressed by ￿nding ways to educate users. Unfortunately, mis-
conceptions about cryptocurrencies appear to be quite frequent
[87, 133]. Studies with non-users and beginners have shown that
cryptocurrencies are di￿cult to get started with [8, 49], also re-
ferred to as the onboarding problem [52]. Scholars attribute the
steep learning curve, to the technology’s embedded complexity
[116] and complicated metaphors that often do not match users’
expectations [49, 50, 132]. For example, several publications report
confusion about the term "wallet" – drawing from their experience
with physical wallets user expect di￿erent functionality [49, 50, 79]
or they connect the term to other concepts such as the native iOS
wallet app [49].

Froehlich et al.

Addresses. Cryptocurrency addresses are another frequent cause
for confusion among new users. Beginners regularly associate the
term with e-mail addresses [49, 133]. Given that they are in essence
long alphanumerical strings, it is not surprising that users ￿nd
them di￿cult to handle [49] and hard to remember [64]. Almutari
et al. show that this makes them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks as they are di￿cult to compare [5].

Cryptocurrency Valuation. Several issues relate directly to cryp-
tocurrencies’ valuation. The high price volatility is reported to be
problematic for everyday use [51, 115], particularly when making
transaction and di￿erent platforms use di￿erent exchange rates
[49, 133]. The often high exchange rates of cryptocurrencies (i.e.
one Bitcoin being worth tens of thousands of US dollars) make them
di￿cult to deal with. Users think in ￿at currency when transacting
[49], making it necessary to convert prices back and forth. When
making purchases at everyday price points, the corresponding cryp-
tocurrency value is a small sub-comma amount (i.e. 50 EUR would
be 0.00089 BTC) that is hard to deal with [49]. Interestingly, all of
these issues are being addressed on a technical level by so-called
stable coins. To our knowledge, there is no published work that
looks into the usability of stable coins.

Transactions. Being central to cryptocurrency wallets, many is-
sues are reported relating to transactions. Interfaces that do not
immediately show transactions after being sent, leave users in con-
fusion about the state of the transaction [49, 64]. The status of pend-
ing transactions if often misunderstood [49, 133]. Resulting from an
inaccurate mental model of how blockchains work [87], users often
expect transactions to be reversible [115, 133]. With the majority
of studies being conducted with Bitcoin, participants frequently
report that they perceive transactions to be slow [49, 64, 115].

Fees. Fees emerged as another problematic and widely reported
area: Many users have an incomplete or inaccurate understanding
of fees [49, 87]. The relation between fees and transaction speed
is unclear [87, 133], users often do not expect that they have to
pay fees [49], and they are perceived as too high [133]. Wallet op-
erators may charge additional platform fees making it even more
complicated to understand fee structures [49, 64, 133]. Con￿guring
transactions with too low fees can cause transactions to be stuck
and not processed by miners and most interfaces do not o￿er the
option to overwrite stuck transactions [133]. While some scholars
recommend to simplify fee selection interfaces by providing expres-
sive categories (i.e. "slow – low fees", "default", "fast – high fees"
[87]), app reviews also show that some users take issue if they can-
not con￿gure fees themselves [133]. Fees calculated automatically
based on heuristics were reported to be unexpectedly expensive if
sent at unfortunate points of time [49].

Ecosystem Integration. Frequent tasks in the evaluation of cryp-
tocurrency wallets involves the purchase of goods [8, 49]. While
users would like to use them as a means of payment [50, 51], there
is still a lack of mainstream adoption, making it di￿cult to ￿nd
merchants [51]. Payment integrations that exist are perceived as
problematic [49]. Froehlich et al. highlight the di￿culties of using
Bitcoin for online purchases when on a mobile device: While many
wallets o￿er features to scan addresses displayed as QR code, this
feature becomes useless when the QR code is displayed within

the browser on the mobile device itself. Paired with missing short-
cuts and broken links this makes it necessary to manually copy
addresses and values back and forth [49]. They consequently argue
for the necessity of better ecosystem integration to create a seam-
less checkout process [49], mimicking payment systems users are
already familiar with [49, 133].

Key Management. Self-managed wallets largely expose the un-
derlying technology and many users perceive dealing with key
management as a burden and bad usability [50]. Some wallets gen-
erate key pairs without the knowledge of the user. While this can
be perceived positively by users who do not want to deal with key
management, it might be a restriction for others [94]. Given the of-
ten inaccurate understanding about key management [87], it might
be negative in the long run to shield users of self-managed wallets
from this. For example, many beginners do not know about the
importance of their backup phrases [87] and users often struggle
with recovery mechanisms of self-managed mobile wallets [133].
Given that irrecoverable keys are a frequent reason for cryptocur-
rency loss [79], scholars suggest di￿erent approaches. Mai et al.
suggest to force users to input parts of their backup phrase to prove
that they saved it [87]. Abramova et al. emphasize the importance
of wallets to transparently communicate about key management,
particularly about storage practices such as encryption [2].

User Groups. Across publications it is apparent that many wal-
lets try to provide one-size-￿ts-all solutions [2, 50, 133]. How-
ever, both qualitative [49, 50, 133] and quantitative [2] studies pro-
vide evidence that cryptocurrency users are not a homogeneous
group, but di￿er in their behavior and their needs. Scholars recom-
mend to build wallets tailored to the needs of speci￿c user groups
[2, 49, 50, 133] and for di￿erent use cases [50]. Relevant dimen-
sions for segmenting users have been identi￿ed in their security
and privacy behavior and their a￿nity towards key management
[2, 50]. To ￿atten the learning curve and enable beginners to get
started, wallets should guide users through their cryptocurrency
journey and create Aha! moments early on [48]. By allowing them
to personalize their experience through user pro￿les [2], they can
gradually progress from simple to more complex topics. The im-
portance of educating users throughout this process is emphasized
by many scholars [48, 49, 67, 116, 133], particularly to resolve mis-
conceptions. This way, users might start with custodial wallets
[50], learn about key management, and graduate to self-managed
wallets [50, 133]

4.4 Blockchain: Engaging Users
Several papers in our review focus on engaging participants in
workshops and design activities surrounding blockchain applica-
tions. These speculative formats make use of physical design kits
or participatory design activities to either facilitate understand-
ing about blockchain or elicit user-centered requirements for the
development of systems. Figure 8 provides a visual overview.

4.4.1 Engaging with Blockchain. With blockchain being perceived
as "black box technology" [88], we found several publications report-
ing workshops and methods to engage a broader audience in the
exploration of the technology. Khairuddin et al. presented BlocKit,
a teaching kit based on materials such as clay, paper and padlocks

in order to demonstrate usage and materialize virtual concepts via
physical objects [72]. Other researchers have used LEGO blocks
and role-playing games featuring pizza-shaped learning materials
to educate about blockchain-based systems [90, 111]. Reporting
results from three workshops, Manohar and Briggs demonstrate
how creative methods are useful to enable critical re￿ection and
knowledge exchange about blackbox technologies. They argue that
design workshops o￿er a useful bridge between disciplines and are
a valuable resource to inform future oriented design implications
[88]. Nissen et al. present GeoCoin, a functional location-based
application for learning and speculative ideation with smart con-
tracts, through which users explore urban debit and credit zones.
Building on this experience, they invited participants to engage
in the exploration and design of further use cases in a subsequent
workshop format [100]. Finally, Kera et al. present a design ￿ction:
They use "anticipatory prototyping" to explore autonomous gover-
nance and combine a technical prototype with the artistic design
￿ction of Lithopia, a village governed by smart contracts. In this
￿ctional village drones execute smart contracts based on the visual
detection of certain actions among villagers by drones and satellites.
The ultimately goal of the project was to explore and challenge
promise of automated smart blockchain governance of participants
and "onlookers" [68].

4.4.2 Participatory Design Activities. We also identi￿ed multiple
publications reporting participatory design activities with users.
In contrast to the research summarized above, these papers aim at
ideating speci￿c use cases or eliciting design requirements from
participants and less at helping participants better understand
blockchain technology. Elsden et al. asked participants about their
experiences with donating money and collected ideas and opinions
on conditional donations [38]. Together with Oxfam they addressed
a similar question from the perspective of charitable organizations,
and explored potential use-cases with employees [37]. Others have,
together with rural and urban agricultural communities, explored
blockchain use cases to level environmental and social inequalities
in food supply chains [55, 107]. Beyond these examples, partici-
patory design approaches were used for exploring local energy
trading systems [32], location-based blockchain applications [100],
and smart-contract governed delivery scenarios [124].

4.5 Blockchain: Speci￿c Application Use Cases
We identi￿ed 39 articles in our systematic review that propose
or evaluate speci￿c blockchain applications or use cases. Figure 9
provides a visual overview. We categorize these articles according
to the topology of blockchain applications by Elsden et al. [35].
Articles with overlaps across the categories were assigned based on
the article’s main focus. An overview of our results can be found
in table 4.

Notes. Articles with overlaps across the categories proposed by Elsden et
al. [35] were assigned based on the article’s main contribution. Elsden et
al.’s paper [35] proposing the typology is not assigned as it discusses all
categories equally.

4.5.1 Underlying Infrastructure. With blockchain protocols and
decentralized ecosystems being the focus of more systems and cryp-
tography oriented research, it is little surprise that this review found
only a small number of articles focusing on underlying infrastruc-
ture technologies across research conducted in HCI. We identi￿ed
work that uses blockchain technology as enabling, underlying soft-
ware platform to create novel applications e.g. [1, 20, 38, 42, 129] and
autonomous or semi-autonomous systems in the context of a net-
worked internet of things [16, 17, 122]. While it may be argued that
these examples ￿t into the taxonomy of underlying infrastructure,
most of the work went beyond the mere technical implementation
by exploring ￿nancial models, socio-economic phenomena and
civic engagement and governance.

4.5.2 Currency. Originally invented as a "peer-to-peer electronic
cash systems" [97], digital currencies are still the most prevalent
use case for blocking technology. In addition, cryptocurrencies and
custom utility tokens not only ￿nd widespread use to facilitate
the exchange of value in the majority of use-cases we revived (e.g.
[1, 16, 17, 20, 38, 42, 42, 122, 129]), but form the underlying incen-
tives for many to participate in the development and upkeep of
the decentralized blockchain networks [97]. Sections 4.2 and 4.3
have covered work on motivations, risks and perceptions of digital
cryptocurrencies and wallets, hence these are not taken into consid-
eration in this section. Speci￿c applications for currencies included
an early point-of-sale (POS) system for a co￿ee shop to accept
Bitcoin by Eskandari et al. [40], a browser plugin for tipping for
educational resources [56], a prototype for mining cryptocurrency
on mobile devices [60], and GeoCoin, an experimental platform
enabling participants to interact with location-based smart con-
tracts [100].

Financial services. A large body of HCI work focusing on ￿-
4.5.3
nancial services using on blockchain technologies developed around
charitable donations. Research conducted by Elsden et al., Trotter
et al., and Bidwell et al. [11, 128, 129] explored the use of blockchain
technologies and smart contracts to increase trust and transparency
through higher levels of agency and control. The "Smart Donations"
system enables donors to attach rules to their charitable gift and
triggers pre-speci￿ed pay-outs in response to real-world events that
are validated through trusted third-party oracles [38, 128]. Trotter
et al. outline domain considerations and challenges alongside a com-
prehensive reference implementation using smart contracts on the
Ethereum blockchain. Notably, the authors decided to build a mobile
application and custom user interface to abstract the underlying
complexity of the Ethereum blockchain and highlighted challenges
in the management and exchange of crypto-assets [129]. Their im-
plementation was later evaluated by Bidwell et al. in an in-the-wild
study with 93 donors over 8-weeks. The study provides insights
into the temporal qualities that emerge from smart contracts that
preserved and enforced ￿nancial intentions from donors. The au-
thors suggest that sensitivity for time, when designing interactions
with blockchains, could facilitate profound temporal orientations
and meaningful user experiences [11]. Similarly, work by Chiang
et al. demonstrate the potential of smart contracts as an automatic,

impartial mediator to increase levels of trust among stakeholders in
￿nancial transactions. The authors ￿nd that for Mexican migrants
living in the US, greater transparency and control around ￿nancial
transactions and the ￿ow of funds to their rural home communities
facilitated by smart contracts can increase trust and cooperation
between individuals and government institutions [20].

4.5.4 Proof-as-a-service. The use of blockchain technologies as a
trusted digital data storage o￿ers a plethora of possible use-cases
and applications. While many applications make use of trusted dig-
ital storage on the ledger, often to facilitate higher degrees of trust
[1, 20, 42, 107, 129], this section speci￿c work developed around
the theme of proof-as-a-service. Our review identi￿ed applications
for provenance in supply and distribution chains, as a trustworthy,
immutable digital notary for both, digital and physical artifacts and
as immutable, trusted data registers.

We found many examples that investigated the application of
blockchain technologies in supply and distribution chains. While
some work has an emphasis on governance e.g. in agri-food [45,
107] and energy markets [32, 91, 116], Jabbar et al. provide de-
tailed insight into the implementation of blockchain technology in
the shipping industry [61]. Other work developed and evaluated
a local courier service system based on smart contracts [123, 124].
Tharatipyakul and Pongnumkul [126] provide a comprehensive sur-
vey on user interfaces in blockchain-based agri-food provenance
tracking applications. Their work categorizes means to collect
(forms, scanning, and sensors) and visualize (text, tables, timelines,
graphs, and maps) provenance data. Their work reveals usability
challenges and emphasizes the need to consider interface design to
widen blockchain adoption in the future [126].

Examples for blockchain in digital notaries include a reference
architecture for an academic certi￿cates registry [3] while [113]
highlighted con￿icts deploying such a system within a higher ed-
ucation institution. Using the example of a system that collects
and stores the history of cars over their life cycle, Zavolokina et al.
discuss trust-enhancing design elements that interaction and user
interface designers can use to increase trust in blockchain-based
proof-as-a-service applications [142]. Wenceslao and Estuar pro-
pose a hybrid system using hashed links between o￿-chain and
on-chain storage to support secure, tamper-proof storage and access
control of (audio) recordings of medical consultations [136].

4.5.5 Property and Ownership. With immutable and trustless dig-
ital ledgers, combined with enforceable rules governed by smart
contracts, blockchains support applications that aim to proof, man-
age and enforce rights related to author- and ownership of all types
of digital and physical assets [9, 35, 42]. Despite its signi￿cant
potential, so far, only little research has been conducted in this
space8. Baytas and Fjeld provide a design provocation challenging
the notions of permanence and disposability of digital and physical
artifacts, exploring how the traditional concept of passed-along-
generations heirlooms can be transferred into the digital realm
using blockchain technologies [9]. Chen and Ko suggest to use aug-
mented reality do materialize digital pets owned on the blockchain
[18]. OLeary et al. address the problem of social loa￿ng in the
workplace through a secure, transparent, immutable and veri￿able
system that captures ownership of an employees individuals intel-
lectual property [101]. Fedosov et al. explore distributed ledgers
in digital sharing economy services through a blockchain-enabled
peer-to-peer lending system. Their "Just Share It" system enables
individuals to share equipment (e.g. tools, sports gear, toys), aiming
to disintermediate interactions, increase trust among peers and
mediate claim management if borrowed items were damaged [42].

4.5.6
Identity Management. Self-sovereign identity management
(SSI) is a well-known and widely researched use case that gained
signi￿cant attention across academia [43, 96, 119], industry9 and
governments10. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity
recently released a comprehensive review of SSI [99] and pilot test
of SSI technologies are currently being carried out in Germany11.
Amid this cross-sector interest in self-sovereign identity manage-
ment, our review has not yielded relevant research conducted in
HCI to address interaction design challenges for identity manage-
ment. The roleplay game, PizzaBlock, by Rankin et al. [111] touches
on decentralized identity management for charity volunteers, al-
beit with a focus on educating non-technical users. Our ￿ndings
highlight a research gap that should be actively addressed by the
HCI and interaction design community in the future.

4.5.7 Governance. Elsden et al. highlight smart contracts’ abil-
ity to facilitate distributed decision making and governance [35].
This section builds on their de￿nition and provides an overview of
HCI research that explores disintermediated control mechanisms,
including semi-autonomous and autonomous systems and decen-
tralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Themes that emerged
in our qualitative analysis of prior work included socio-technical
challenges around autonomous human-machine interactions, new
forms of organizational governance and community engagement.
Lustig discusses visions of decentralized autonomous systems
and identi￿es three possible frames through which to interpret
imagineries about autonomous systems: (1) as physical objects, (2)

8We are aware of recent research in the HCI community around the use of non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) e.g. [46]. However, this research was conducted outside the time frame
of this systematic review (see section 2) and has hence not been included in this review.
We expect and encourage more work around the category of ownership and possession
in the near future.

as mathematical rules, or (3) as arti￿cial mangers [84]. Tallyn et. al
are the ￿rst to report the design of a blockchain-enabled system
with the autonomously acting co￿ee machine BitBarista, which
besides selling co￿ee was also capable of rewarding users for main-
tenance tasks such as replenishing beans or emptying co￿ee grinds
[122] using Bitcoins. This idea was developed further by Cardenas
and Kim which explored the design choices and social implications
for ￿nancial robot-human agreements. Initial work presented roBU,
a prototype robot that was able to provide ￿nancial incentives to hu-
mans helping the robot to archive targets (e.g. attending university
classes and traveling around the world [16]. Later work included
interactions with virtual robotic agents and more sophisticated
con￿gurations, e.g. an autonomous ride-sharing service [17].

Use-cases around organizational governance cover a broad scope.
Several studies have discussed the use of decentralized smart con-
tracts in the context of energy markets. Scuri et al. conducted
human-centered research into self-governing, decentralized energy
trading which provides insights into peoples perceptions, needs,
motivations and proposes design guidelines for P2P energy trading
platforms [116]. Doebelt and Kreußlein base their qualitative re-
search on a similar use case exploring the needs and expectations of
both consumers and considering gami￿cation to facilitate engage-
ment across the community. Notably, they conclude that energy
supply through peer-to-peer communities should be considered as
an additional rather than an alternative to the existing grid sup-
ply [32]. Early work by Meeuw et al. presents ￿rst results of user
interface evaluations for autonomous peer-to-peer micro-grids [91].
Work by Rooksby and Dimitrov highlights the friction of de-
ploying new forms of decentralized governance in established or-
ganizational structures by deploying a DAO within their university
[113], while Abadi et al. aim to improve student engagement and
participation through a decentralized student peer-trading platform
with reputation system [1]. Other work explores the potential for
socio-economic development and governance of rural communities
through smart contracts. Pschetz et al. explore the use of decen-
tralized governance in the context of smallholder farmers in the
Caribbean. The authors highlight that the challenge is not in the
actual money and commodity transactions but in the design of the
terms and enforcement mechanisms implemented in smart con-
tracts. [107]. This is developed further by Heitlinger et al., who
discuss the possibilities of dehumanizing food systems through an
algorithmic management on the blockchain.

4.6 Blockchain: Support Tools
We identi￿ed multiple publications which present support tools.
While publications in the previous section used blockchain as de-
sign material to build systems, the ones presented here are aux-
iliary tools for blockchain [35]. The majority of publications in
this category is not published in ACM, but in IEEE and Springer.
Salient subtopics concern interactive tools to analyze and make
sense of blockchain transaction data, as well as development sup-
port tools for smart contracts. Other prototypes include StockSense,
a wrist-worn vibrotactile display that signals its users cryptocur-
rency market movements [104] and Brokerbot, a multiplatform
cryptocurrency chatbot [82]. Figure 10 provides a visual overview.

4.6.1 Transaction Analytics and Visualization. Transactions on most
blockchain-based networks are public. However, due to the sheer
number of transactions and their pseudonymous design it is hard
for novices and experts alike to make sense of the data in front
of them, which is usually only provided in the form of text [141].
Transaction analytics tools aim to transform this data into a more
human-friendly format. Yue et al.’s BitExTract enables its users to
gain a better understanding of transactions between large Bitcoin
exchanges. Several researchers focus on systems to better visualize
connections between Bitcoin addresses. By o￿ering advanced ￿lters
and analytics they aim to support law enforcement or make inter-
actions simpler for users [120, 141, 145]. Tovanovich et al. present
an extensive review about visualization of blockchain data by sur-
veying existing applications and academic literature [127], which
o￿ers an excellent overview of state-of-the-art approaches.

4.6.2 Development Support Tools. Another set of publications is
dedicated to the improvement of smart contracts development –
particularly, to lower the entry bar for developers with less technical
expertise through low-code tools. Tan et al. present a prototype
for a visual smart contract construction system that allows non-
programmers to develop smart contracts [125].

Pursuing a similar objective, Weingärtner et al. aim to make
smart contract development more accessible for non-computer ex-
perts. They present a graphical programming language for the de-
velopment of legal smart contracts and, in a brief evaluation, collect
indicative evidence that people without programming knowledge
can use it [135]. Hossain et al. develop a graphical user interface
for the Multichain, a cross-chain router protocol, to make it acces-
sible for people from non-technical backgrounds. Their evaluation
showed higher e￿ciency, better user satisfaction, and an increased
overall usability when compared to the original command line
interface [57].

5 DISCUSSION
Our systematic literature review provides an overview of HCI re-
search on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. We aim to synthesize
academic work that has evolved around the experiences, socio-
technical challenges, and the design knowledge about blockchain
applications. In the following, we draw on recent developments

within the wider cryptocurrency and blockchain space to discuss
overlaps and di￿erences of the progress observed between research
and practice.

5.1 Recent Developments in the Blockchain

Ecosystem

The blockchain ecosystem has experienced fast-paced growth over
the last decade [29]. While until recently, Ethereum was the only
widely used permissionless blockchain platform supporting decen-
tralized applications, today, several new blockchains for decen-
tralized applications have reached maturity [118]. Ethereum and
Bitcoin remain the largest ecosystems, yet newcomers like Solana,
Polkadot, and Cosmos boast vibrant developer communities with
more than 500 monthly active contributors. Many of these emerging
blockchains (e.g. Solana, Polkadot, Terra) even exhibit faster ecosys-
tem growth than Ethereum [118]. What distinguishes many of these
new blockchains from Ethereum is a host of di￿erent technical inno-
vations aimed at overcoming current limitations, particularly speed,
transaction throughput, and expensive fees. Much of the challenge
of improving the transaction throughput of a blockchain is related
to the so-called blockchain scalability trilemmma. In essence, it is as-
sumed that for any particular blockchain its scalability, security, and
decentralization are dependent features. An improvement to either
one of these properties will negatively a￿ect at least one of the oth-
ers [95]. While Ethereum, with its sizeable decentralized ecosystem,
seems to struggle to deploy the required infrastructural changes
to overcome its current limitations, the upcoming challengers act
more agile. The ongoing emergence of several blockchain systems
in parallel can thus be traced back to an opportune moment to
challenge the Ethereum ecosystem and to diverging approaches to
balance the scalability trilemma in doing so.

Many believe that this new generation of blockchains, now pro-
viding transactions at instantaneous speed and low transaction
costs, will herald the third stage of the web. Web 1.0 allowed users
on the internet the possibility to read content. Web 2.0 introduced
the option to write, and thus enabled rich interactive internet ap-
plications. Powered by blockchain, web3 now adds the possibility
to own, create, and distribute digital assets. Many practitioners
believe this read-write-own paradigm will enable a new class of

Blockchain in HCI: A Systematic Review

internet applications with a signi￿cant potential for innovation
[10]. First indications of this paradigm shift are the emergence
of decentralized ￿nance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs),
which by now account for over two-thirds of transactions on the
Ethereum blockchain [130] and are a driver for user adoption of
Ethereum [24].

Juxtaposing the development of the blockchain and cryptocur-
rency ecosystem with the available research analyzed in this review
reveals several gaps. While many of the issues identi￿ed by past HCI
research are now being addressed through emerging blockchain
platforms and technological improvements, formal validation is
outstanding. For example, stablecoins address price volatility, and
new application blockchains, enabled by novel consensus algo-
rithms, provide high transaction throughput with low-cost fees.
The Ethereum Name Service12 (ENS) maps alphanumerical wallet
addresses to human-readable names, allowing users to easily share
their wallets. Emerging gateway services like Infura13 bridge the
gap between blockchains and the web for developers. However,
until now, HCI research has overwhelmingly focused on only two
large blockchain platforms, Bitcoin and Ethereum. This leaves a
gap in understanding the full potential of these new technologies,
particularly how we can build interactive, usable, secure, and user-
centered blockchain applications.

While some work designed and discussed dedicated mobile ap-
plications (e.g. [9, 100, 107, 129]), the majority of decentralized
applications (dApps) runs in the web browser. Being the de-facto
gateway to web3, browser-based wallets such as Metamask14 fa-
cilitate the interaction with dApps. However, we have not found a
single study looking into browser-based wallets, leaving a critical
gap in understanding their role for interaction with decentralized
applications. This is particularly relevant as the emergence of web3
is accompanied by phenomena challenging human interaction and
collaboration on the internet. DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized au-
tonomous organizations (DAOs) are the most widespread examples
that have driven recent user adoption. To date, only little research
has been conducted around DeFi and NFTs. While research started
exploring speci￿c use cases for DAOs from a technical perspective,
we have only identi￿ed a single paper that examined the speci￿c im-
pact of infrastructural limitations (i.e. fees) on user participation in
DAOs. We know little about how people within these decentralized
organizations manage the socio-technical challenges arising from
the tension between pseudonymity and the need to collaborate and
trust each other.

Arguably, it is time for HCI to move beyond Bitcoin, chart into
new waters, and explore the increasingly diverse ecosystem of cryp-
tocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies15 as a whole. The
technical advances in the ￿eld o￿er a plethora of opportunities to
use blockchain as a design material to experiment with novel forms
of interaction design and craft rich and interactive experiences.

5.2 Future Research Agenda
This discussion and its preceding literature review highlight the
importance of HCI in the ongoing development of blockchain ap-
plications. Over the past 8 years, a diverse research body has been
established through the works of many scholars. To conclude this
paper, we present ￿ve research avenues the HCI and interaction
design community may address in the future.

5.2.1 A be￿er understanding of Blockchain Users. Existing research
shows that blockchain and cryptocurrency users are an increasingly
heterogeneous group with di￿erent motivations, needs, skills, and
experiences. With ￿rst works untangling the user base of cryptocur-
rency existing [2], there remains more work to better understand
and segment users. Particularly, the recent emergence of web3,
most prominently through DeFi and NFTs, has likely drawn in new
users with di￿erent motivations and expectations than the early
Bitcoin adopters. For example, "Twitter NFT" has emerged as a
subculture with its own language (e.g. "gm", "probably nothing",
"WAGMI") [108]. Likely the ideology connecting people within this
group is quite di￿erent from the "True Bitcoiner" ideology reported
by Knittel et al. [76, 77] and HCI should continue to aim for a better
understanding of the economic context under which people become
involved with web3. Contesting borders between the digital and
physical world, we have seen examples of virtual groups of people
organizing themselves into DAOs to achieve common goals. For
example, Constitution DAOs attracted more than 19,000 members
in an e￿ort to buy a rare copy of the US constitution [110]. Build-
ing on the existing research body about trust, future scholars may
explore how these decentralized pseudonymous groups organize
themselves, build trust, and maintain it over time.

With diversity and inclusion being longstanding values within
the HCI community, another topic to address is the question of why
there is such a gender imbalance in the blockchain space. Multi-
ple authors recognize this imbalance in the demographics of their
papers, yet none of them attempted to ￿nd an explanation. With or-
ganizations like Global Women in Blockchain16 aiming to empower
women to engage with the technology, change is happening, and
numbers are slowly growing [86]. Being champions of diversity, we
urge the HCI community to take an active role in identifying the
reasons that hold women back from engaging with the technology
and make an e￿ort to change that.

5.2.2 Generative Interaction Design for Wallets. Our review shows
that existing research has investigated the perception and usability
of various cryptocurrency wallets in both qualitative and quan-
titative studies. Many scholars highlight challenges and propose
implications for design – however, these remain largely untested.
We identi￿ed only three publications [18, 30, 48] implementing
wallets or prototyping interfaces. Given that wallets are essential to
interact with cryptocurrencies and dApps, future interaction design
research is challenged to ￿ll this gap. The ultimate outcome of this
strand of research could be a set of validated design heuristics and
guidelines speci￿c to cryptocurrencies, as suggested by Voskobo-
jnikov et al. [133]. Against the backdrop of an increasingly diverse
blockchain ecosystem, it is likely necessary to explore wallets for

Froehlich et al.

di￿erent use cases and on di￿erent devices to develop these heuris-
tics: Hardware wallets for secure long term storage, exchanges and
online wallets for quick access and trading, mobile wallets for pay-
ments, and browser-based wallets for interaction with dApps on
both desktop and mobile devices.

Assuming a growing integration of blockchain into the web,
more and more information will be tied to a speci￿c address. It will
be important to design and evaluate educational concepts helping
users to update their mental models and overcome misconceptions
that otherwise could lead to costly mistakes. To make use of the
full bene￿ts promised by blockchain technology, users need to
manage their keys on their own. While certainly not desired by
all users, exploring ways to safely transition from custodial to
self-managed wallets will be important to reduce losses for users
who want to. Even though some papers mentioned the positive
innovation cryptocurrency has brought to key management (e.g.
mnemonics, private keys encoded in 12-word phrases) there was
no study in our sample that actively explored this design space.
Interaction design can take an active role in developing concepts
for key management that nudge users towards secure behavior and
provide usable security.

5.2.3 Moving beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin has laid the foundation for
cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption, so it is not surprising
that the majority of existing research focuses on the use of Bitcoin.
However, the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is diversifying
with new generations of blockchain platforms, which are being
increasingly adopted by users, developers, and the market [118].
This can also be seen in the gradual decline of Bitcoin’s dominance
[28]. We argue that future research should be con￿dent to move
beyond Bitcoin and adopt state-of-the-art blockchains both as a
research subject and platform for new designs and innovation.
Doing so two directions will be particularly interesting.

First, we suggest to evaluate whether emerging technologies
are able to ful￿ll their promise to overcome the performance and
scalability issues identi￿ed by literature across the domain. Due
to the current focus on technology that was introduced some 6-
10 years ago, some of the issues pertaining to cryptocurrencies
might be less prevalent or even solved through advancements in
the technology today. In particular, the challenges around scalability
and fees could be revisited to update the sector’s understanding.

The second direction is to explore and prototype with the in-
creasingly specialized set of blockchains as design material: De-
centralized application platforms – e.g. layer-1 platforms such as
Polkadot, Solana and Cosmos and layer-2 blockchains like Polygon,
Avalanche, Terra, or Bitcoin Lightning – o￿er novel opportunities
for interaction design. Development tools for smart contract devel-
opment have matured over the past years, making it easier to design
and build smart contracts and decentralized applications. With their
promise for faster transaction speeds at lower costs researchers and
designers can chart the design space for truly interactive blockchain
applications.

5.2.4 Engaging with Web3 and Decentralized Applications (dApps).
An increasing number of decentralized applications is being adopted
by users [24]. This large variety of new applications o￿ers vast op-
portunities for HCI to research fundamental socio-technical mecha-
nisms connected to blockchain technology. With new technical and

mental models being developed, it is a promising space for service
and interaction designers.

Measured by the gas fee burn rates, today around two-thirds of
transactions on the Ethereum blockchain can be attributed to either
NFTs or DeFi, having superseded the mere monetary transfers
[130]. While these application areas have been exhibiting increased
adoption by users in recent years, this trend has not been re￿ected
in the amount of research being carried out within HCI. In the case
of DeFi, the design of interfaces and support tools could have a
substantial in￿uence on user behavior (c.f. [78]). More dynamic,
intelligent interfaces could, for example, guide users to make better
decisions on complex transactions within decentralized exchanges
to avoid transactions being delayed or even intercepted. Elsden
et al. [35] envisaged the opportunities of digital ownership on
blockchain. With the emergence of NFTs this became a reality.
NFTs o￿er an opportunity to further explore the meaning of digital
ownership and could revolutionize how digital content creators
design, create, trade, and own digital assets. At the same time, NFTs
sparked discussion about the value and uniqueness of digital items
that can be easily copied. Nevertheless, more and more people are
willing to pay for them and thus derive some bene￿t from owning
them.

With the majority of decentralized applications being consumed
through the web browser, there is a need to better understand
the role of gateway services. Decentralized applications on web3
frequently do not connect to the blockchain directly but through
centralized services like Infura. The role of reintermediation of a
disintermediated system raises questions about how to maintain
power balances, privacy, and the integrity of data visualized in
the actual user interfaces that have so far not been addressed by
research.

5.2.5
Identity on the ledger. Despite the large public interest, our
￿ndings highlighted a signi￿cant research gap in HCI around self-
sovereign identity management (SSI). SSI has the potential to man-
age identities in a simple, uncomplicated, trustworthy, and self-
reliant way. We would like to encourage the HCI and interaction
design community to explore research avenues in this direction.
Comparable to an identity document like a passport, web3 opens
up opportunities to create virtual identities and reputation that
counter-balance the trust challenges [114, 115] in an otherwise
pseudonymous system. Aimed at overcoming the need for isolated
accounts on every web platform, Sign-In-With-Ethereum17 allows
developers to use the wallet address of a user to authenticate them.
While bene￿cial from the standpoint of privacy and security from
a user’s standpoint – gone is the need to share e-mail addresses
or enter passwords – this arguably raises questions for website
operators on how to deal with the loss of information that today is
often at the core of internet business models.

Blockchain-based identity extends beyond technical aspects and
opens up fundamental questions about how human identity can
be expressed in an increasingly digital world. The Ethereum Name
Service is the most widely used tool that allows users to connect
their wallet address to a human-readable name, comparable to how
domain name services (DNS) map names and IP addresses. This

seemingly super￿cial abstraction allows users to establish a share-
able and permanent identity to which they can link their online
personas. By doing so, they can build a reputation through trans-
actions connected to their addresses that is public to see and easy
to verify by others. This phenomenon can already be seen in the
context of web3: People are starting to use NFTs as a form of hu-
man expression and self-identity on social media. They present
themselves through online personas disconnected from their real
identities, set NFTs as pro￿le pictures, use them as avatars in video
calls (see e.g. huddle01.com18), or use the transaction history con-
nected to their wallets as source of reputation (see e.g. POAPs19). It
remains to be seen in how far self-sovereign identity can prevail
against the centralized services that govern the internet today. For
HCI, there is an opportunity to chart the designed space of digital
identity, connecting the underlying technological constraints with
the fundamental human need for the expression of one’s identity.

6 CONCLUSION
This paper presents a systematic literature review of blockchain and
cryptocurrency research in HCI. Our analysis includes 99 relevant
papers published between 2014 and 2021. We identify six salient
themes: 1) the role of trust, (2) understanding motivation, risk, and
perception of cryptocurrencies, (3) the usability of cryptocurrency
wallets, (4) engaging users with blockchain, (5) using blockchain
for application-speci￿c use-cases, and (6) designing support tools
for blockchain. We summarize the generated design knowledge,
discuss open challenges, and juxtapose the current research body
with the changing landscape of emerging blockchain technologies
to chart the space for future HCI research. We encourage HCI
researcher to better understand blockchain users, take an active
approach to designing wallets, adopt new blockchains as design
material, engage with web3 and decentralized applications, and
explore digital identity. We hope that this paper provides a valuable
overview of the current state of blockchain and cryptocurrency
research in HCI and that it can act as road map for researchers and
practitioners moving forward.
