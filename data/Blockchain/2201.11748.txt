REDUCING COVID-19 CASES AND DEATHS BY APPLYING BLOCKCHAIN IN VACCINATION ROLLOUT MAN-
AGEMENT

ABSTRACT

Goal: Because a fast vaccination rollout against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical
to restore daily life and avoid virus mutations, it is tempting to have a relaxed vaccination-
administration management system. However, a robust management system can support the
enforcement of preventive measures, and in turn, reduce incidence and deaths. Here, we model a
trustable and reliable management system based on blockchain for vaccine distribution by extending
the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model. The model includes prevention measures
such as mask-wearing, social distance, vaccination rate, and vaccination efﬁciency. It also considers
negative social behavior, such as violations of social distance and attempts of using illegitimate
vaccination proofs. By evaluating the model, we show that the proposed system can reduce up to 2.5
million cases and half a million deaths in the most demanding scenarios.

Impact Statement: The use of blockchain technology on the system managing vaccination distribution
enables a reliable exercise of infection prevention measures and a reduction of COVID-19 incidence
and the number of deaths during and after vaccination rollout.

Introduction

With the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the world has been waiting for vaccines against the
disease to counter its negative health and economic impacts that have affected everyone. COVID-19 is caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is highly contagious and has been fatal for
millions of people [1–5]. COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets of saliva that are expelled when a person coughs,
heavily breaths, talks, or even normally breathes. Detection of saliva is difﬁcult as multiple of its components may
need to be detected. Therefore, face-covering is considered a pivotal prevention measure as it provides a high degree of
protection to both the wearer and the surrounding people. However, it is not 100% protective. Therefore, there is hope
that vaccinations will mitigate or even stop the spreading of this disease [6].

Recently, the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, while exercising social distancing and wearing face masks, is giving
hope to the global population of restoring normal life. As more of the world population is now getting vaccinated,
the management of the rollout and veriﬁcation of vaccination records require not only accurate bookkeeping but
also ubiquitous and secure access while maintaining user privacy. Accurate and accessible vaccination records are
critical to provide an effective vaccination rollout and to support the execution of preventive measures, such as social
distance [2, 7].

COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers are being administered to the world population [8–10] aiming to
vaccinate people rapidly and thus to leverage restoring normalcy, minimize health and economic damage, and reduce
virus mutation opportunity [11]. The speedy distribution has to be carefully managed to avoid suboptimal beneﬁts.

Reducing COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Applying Blockchain in Vaccination Rollout Management

However, the desirable synchronization and coordination of electronic vaccination records may be difﬁcult to achieve in
such a large vaccine distribution as it requires compatibility and administrative agreements among vaccination sites and
upper administrators. Furthermore, the lack of secure processes to record vaccination events may make it difﬁcult to
enforce prevention measures at the rollout time and in the future. Vaccine veriﬁcation could help to quickly restore
daily social activities and traveling, as it may allow us to identify the susceptible and the potential source of infection.
This veriﬁcation requires reliable vaccination records that are secure, private, and accessible.

Blockchain has been proposed as a technology that can satisfy the security and reliability of vaccination records [12–16].
Beyond the technological advantages, a management system leveraged by blockchain may encourage people to get
vaccinated and ultimately reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. In such approach, electronic immunization
records are tied to veriﬁable blockchain transactions. Despite many recent proposals of blockchain-based vaccination
certiﬁcation approaches to store veriﬁable vaccination records, their impact on limiting or stopping the incidence of
COVID-19 is still unknown.

To address this issue, we model the incidence and vaccination rollout by extending two Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-
Recovered (SEIR) models. The SEIR-Vaccination (SEIR-V) model includes a vaccinated compartment using a
conventional vaccination rollout campaign, and the SEIR-Vaccination-Blockchain (SEIR-VB) model uses blockchain to
perform vaccination veriﬁcation. With SEIR-VB, a policy of social distance can be encouraged by enabling vaccination
veriﬁcation as a passport to activities that may require reduced social distance. This paper shows that blockchain not
only facilitates the management of vaccinations but also decreases the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths as
compared to a system without blockchain.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Developed as a secure ledger in digital cryptocurrencies [17], blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger technology
that records veriﬁable transactional data [18]. Its immutability feature makes it applicable to a variety of healthcare
systems [19–21]. A blockchain ledger consists of a cryptographically secured chain of chronologically ordered blocks
of transactions. This ledger is distributed across multiple peers to ensure data availability and resiliency against failures
and attacks [22].

Bansal et al. [14] proposed to use blockchain as a repository of test results and vaccination records as veriﬁable
immunization certiﬁcates. Hasan et at. [16] proposed a blockchain-based solution to securely store digital medical
passports with immunity certiﬁcates for COVID-19. Eisenstadt et al. [15] developed a prototype of a decentralized
blockchain-based mobile application to store portable COVID-19 vaccination certiﬁcates. Such certiﬁcates may be used
to verify the susceptibility of a person to contract COVID-19 and of being a source of infection.

Blockchain can also be used as a decentralized tracking information system. For example, Marbouh et at. [23] proposed
a blockchain that leverages smart contracts to transparently and reliably consolidate statistical data on COVID-19
incidence. Nguyen et at. [24] presented a conceptual architecture that combines blockchain and artiﬁcial intelligence to
monitor and track the COVID-19 outbreak in real-time.

But Blockchain can ﬁnd its main application in detecting events that actually occurred, such as a vaccination, vaccine
production, or social distance neglects. Tseng et al. [25] and Yong et al. [26] proposed a blockchain system to verify
the legitimacy of drugs and vaccines, respectively. Blockchain has been also proposed to monitor the efﬁcacy of
administered vaccines and dosages and to detect possible secondary effects [24]. However, these works have not
addressed the question that justiﬁes its adoption during the COVID-19 vaccination rollout, as how helpful blockchain
would be in such a campaign by preventing cases and deaths. We address this question in this paper through the
following models.

2.1 Extended SEIR Models

The SEIR model is used to evaluate the spreading of an infectious disease over time [27]. It categorizes individuals of a
population into different compartments. The susceptible compartment is the group of individuals without immunity
to the infection. The exposed compartment is the group of individuals who have been in close contact with infected
individuals, and the recovered compartment is the group of the individuals who have recovered from the disease and
developed immunity.

The prevention measures that reduce the number of COVID-19 cases considered in the extended SEIR models are mask
wearing and social distancing. Vaccination against COVID-19 is a measure considered in the model to reduce cases and
to convert a susceptible individual into an immune individual. This conversion depends on the vaccine efﬁcacy, the
vaccination rate, and the time for individuals to develop immunity. The willingness of individuals to get vaccinated also

2

Reducing COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Applying Blockchain in Vaccination Rollout Management

affects the immunity rate. Particularly, the models consider symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 infections. The
models also consider individuals’ behaviors that affect the efﬁcacy of these measures, such as neglecting social distance
and falsely claiming wellness and vaccination.

The daily rate of change in the number of susceptible individuals, given by (1), is the sum of unvaccinated individuals
that get exposed to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals, based on the contagious rate (β); the
susceptible individuals that get vaccinated based on both the vaccination rate (vr), and the likelihood of vaccine
willingness (lv); and the vaccinated individuals that remain susceptible based on the vaccine efﬁcacy (ve). The
contagious rate β is deﬁned as the ratio between the basic reproduction number (R0), which is deﬁned by the average
number of secondary cases that an infected individual infects, and the infection period [28].

Both SEIR-V and SEIR-VB models are described by (1) to (7), which determine the daily number of individuals in the
respective compartments. Table 1 describes the variables used in the models. Sk and Ik represent the susceptible and
infected individuals in the SEIR-V (k=w) and SEIR-VB (k=b) models, respectively (8). The daily number of exposed
individuals, given in (2), accounts for the newly exposed individuals; the exposed and unvaccinated individuals who
may start to develop symptoms after the incubation period (1/δ days); and the fraction of the total exposed individuals
that are vaccinated and recover as determined by the vaccine efﬁcacy. The daily number of infected individuals includes
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and both having a similar viral load [29]. A case-fatality rate (α) is deﬁned as
the ratio of the number of deaths to the total number of cases.

The daily number of infected symptomatic individuals in (3) accounts for the exposed and unvaccinated individuals who
get COVID-19 with a probability of symptomatic infection pis; the cases that recover after the infection period of 1/γ
days; the asymptomatic individuals that develop COVID-19 with probability pip after 1/λ days; and the critical cases
that unfortunately become deaths after the critical infection period of 1/α days. The daily number of asymptomatic
individuals in (4) accounts for the portion of exposed and unvaccinated individuals who become asymptomatic; the
cases that develop infection; and the cases that remain asymptomatic and develop immunity with or without vaccination
after 1/vi days and 1/µ days, respectively.

The daily number of recovered individuals, determined by (5), is the accumulated number of the recovered cases and
the vaccinated individuals per day. A portion of the vaccinated individuals develop immunity. The portion is deﬁned by
the vaccine efﬁciency. The daily number of immune individuals in (6) is a function of both the recently vaccinated
individuals and the vaccinated individuals that develop immunity. The daily number of deaths in (7) is the accumulated
number of critical cases that result in deaths.

Then, the Sk and Ik for the SEIR-V and SEIR-VB models are:

Sw = (1 − pmme)[ pf v + psn(1 − pf v) ]

The different compartments of the SEIR-V and SEIR-VB models follow the tree diagram shown in Fig. 1. False
vaccination claims might occur with probability pf v. Infected individuals are aware of infection with probability pa
and may conceal the infection with probability pci. The percentage of the mask-wearing population and the protection
efﬁcacy of mask wearing are denoted by pm and me, respectively.

sequence of states of an individual used in the proposed SEIR extended models. The diagram shows the considered
states in this paper.

Individuals with an active immunization proof (i.e., a proof showing the period that immunization is active) are
allowed to socialize and participate in regular activities. Individuals without the proof may be allowed to socialize with
restrictions with probability psn. Table 1 lists the notations used in this paper. Sk and Ik for an immunization system
without blockchain are denoted as Sw as in (9) and Iw as in (10), and for a system with blockchain, as Sb as in (11) and
Ib as in (12), respectively. See the code of these models in [30].

3 RESULTS

The numerical evaluations of SEIR-V and SEIR-VB show the difference in the number of cases and deaths for a period
of 120 days using parameters as reported in the literature (Table 1 also shows the default values). Both SEIR-V and
SEIR-VB are applied to a population of 330 million individuals (e.g., USA population), as an example. As initial
conditions, the population considers 2% infected cases [31], which includes symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and
the rest as susceptible. These models were developed during 2020 and 2021.

The evaluation considers the following parameters: A reproduction number of 2.5 [32]; a case fatality rate of 2/100 [33];
an average infection, incubation, and critical infection periods of 9, 5, and 18 days, respectively [34–37]; a probability
of infection awareness of 2/100 [38]; a vaccine efﬁcacy of 95% [39, 40]; the start of the vaccination rollout on day 1; a
daily vaccination rate of 5/1000 [41]; a vaccine willingness of 80% [42, 43]; and an immunity period of 14 days after
vaccination [44, 45].

The models assume that individuals with a vaccination proof socialize without restrictions, while those without a proof
may socialize with a 10% restriction. Immunity may be claimed arbitrarily by any individual. Infected individuals
may conceal the infection with 30/100 probability [46], and neglect prevention rules. The probability of asymptomatic

infection is set to 60/100, from which 30/100 may become symptomatic after 14 days [47–49]. Both the daily and total
reduced number of cases and deaths are analyzed considering different percentages of the population that wear masks.
The mask-wearing efﬁcacy is set to 80% [50, 51]. Table 1 shows the default parameters used in the evaluation of the
SEIR-V and SEIR-VB models.

3.1 Reduced Cases and Deaths by Blockchain

Fig. 2 shows the reduced number of cases and deaths by using the blockchain management system. Fig. 2(a) shows the
reduced prevalence of COVID-19 cases through enforcing prevention measures, such as managing access to places that
require a reduced social distance by veriﬁcation of vaccination certiﬁcates. Fig. 2(b) shows the reduced total number of
deaths. The ﬁgures show that during the ﬁrst 20 days of the vaccination rollout, the blockchain management system
would decrease the number of cases by more than 2.5 million with 50% of the population wearing masks and about
500,000 cases with 90% of the population wearing masks. Fig. 2(b) shows that the blockchain system can reduce the
number of deaths by about 46,000 with 50% of the population wearing masks and about 4,200 deaths with 90% of the
population wearing masks.

3.2

Impact by People Behavior and Vaccine Features

We classify the variables into two groups: prevention measures that decrease the incidence, such as vaccination efﬁcacy,
vaccination rate, and social distancing, and negative social behavior that increases the incidence, such as infected
individuals who are aware or unaware of their infections and unvaccinated individuals claiming being vaccinated, all
ignoring social distancing.

Fig. 2(c) shows that the number of deaths decreases as individuals become aware of their infection and quarantine
themselves. These results show that the adoption of blockchain could reduce more than 30,000 deaths for 70% of
infection awareness with 50% of the population wearing masks. The difference in the number of deaths increases as the
percentage of the wearing-mask population decreases because blockchain enables the detection of high-risk individuals
as more individuals are exposed. The blockchain system may reduce about 3,000 deaths with 90% of the population
wearing masks and 100% of infection awareness.

3.3

Impact of Individual’s Behavior

Fig. 2(d) shows that the blockchain system may reduce about 27,000 deaths with 10% of the infected individuals
concealing their infection and 50% of the population wearing masks. On the other hand, this system may decrease
about 3,000 deaths with 90% of the population wearing masks. The blockchain system also shows beneﬁts against
false vaccination claims. Fig. 2(e) shows that the blockchain system may reduce about 70,000 deaths for a 90% false
vaccination claim rate with 50% of the population wearing masks and about 6,700 deaths with 90% of the population
wearing masks. Its smallest impact is a reduction of about 2,700 deaths for a 10% rate of false vaccination claims with
90% of the population wearing masks.

The blockchain management system also reduces the number of cases and deaths when individuals neglect social
distancing. It reduces about 60,000 deaths when each individual practices unsafe social distancing with 50% of the
population wearing masks, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The smallest impact can be seen by a reduction of about 5,000 deaths
with 90% of the population wearing masks.

3.4

Impact of Vaccine Features

Fig. 2(g) shows that a 100% effective vaccine alone would be insufﬁcient to avoid as many deaths as the combination
of vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing would. The blockchain system combined with a 100% effective
vaccine would reduce more than 40,000 deaths with 50% of the population wearing masks and about 4,000 deaths
with 90% of the population wearing masks. A lower efﬁcacy vaccine may increase the number of deaths and that may
increase the role importance of the blockchain system.

Fig. 2(h) shows that at a daily vaccination rate of 1% of the population, the blockchain system would reduce 3,700
and 35,000 deaths with 90 and 50% of the population wearing masks, respectively. Table 2 shows that the blockchain
system can reduce the number of cases as the contagion level increases. For example, the proposed system may reduce
15 and 47 million cases under no social distance but with 50% of the population wearing masks and a low vaccination

rate of 0.1%, for virus reproduction numbers of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. Also, the blockchain system could reduce 1.3
and 1.9 million cases for a high vaccination rate of 0.5%, with 50% of the population wearing masks, and individuals
socializing with 90% restrictions with reproduction numbers of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively.

With the vaccination rollout, the number of individuals wearing masks may decrease but that could increase the number
of cases and deaths. Table 2 shows that with a low daily vaccination rate of 0.1%, with 50% of the population wearing
masks and no individuals keeping social distance, the system could reduce more than 80,000 deaths for a (virus)
reproduction number of 2.5 and more than 230,000 deaths for a reproduction number of 3.5. On the other hand, at a
daily vaccination rate of 0.5%, 90% of the population wearing masks, and individuals socializing with 90% restrictions,
the system could still reduce 1,300 and 1,850 deaths for reproduction numbers of 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. Even though
these numbers of deaths are small in comparison with the initial population, decreasing incidence and mortality is
deemed signiﬁcant.

4 DISCUSSION

Modeling and forecasting the incidence of infectious diseases such a COVID-19 is challenging because of the dynamics
of the many involved parameters [52]. The parameters used in our evaluations are time invariant. However, as more
people become vaccinated, mask wearing rates may decrease and evaluations of such scenario would be needed.

Using blockchain to track vaccinated individuals would support the enforcing of prevention measures. These evaluations
consider a uniform enforcement of preventive rules across the whole population in the SEIR-VB model, but non-
uniformity may be more realistic in a country and that may need to be considered. Enforcing the prevention measures in
the world has been challenging. Therefore, the use of blockchain may face some resistance and a ﬂexible approach may
need to be developed. Also, the current rollout may target fast vaccination of the population to provide a fast health and
economic relief. Such a case may include variable vaccination rates that may need be analyzed in similar performance
terms as done in this paper.

5 CONCLUSION

Blockchain provides a means to reliably record vaccinations and issue time-dependent certiﬁcates that can be used to
enforce vaccination veriﬁcation in a pandemic. We modeled and evaluated a vaccine distribution management system
that reliably veriﬁes whether an individual is vaccinated so that such individual can be allowed to participate in social
activities of normal daily life, including reduced social distancing, traveling, or group gatherings.

The performance of the proposed blockchain system was evaluated by the reduced number of cases and deaths between
the blockchain management system and a conventional system that uses no blockchain. The results indicate that the
adoption of blockchain as an immunization control system could reduce the number of cases and deaths, as an important
effect of performing preventive measures.

Reducing COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Applying Blockchain in Vaccination Rollout Management

Figure 2: Reduced (a) prevalence; (b) cumulative reduced number of deaths; and total reduced number of deaths
using a blockchain-based immunization system for a period of 120 days, as a function of (c) probability of infection
awareness; (d) probability of concealing infection; (e) probability of unsafe socializing; (f) vaccine efﬁcacy; and (g)
daily vaccination rates. Prevalence and number of deaths are more effectively reduced as conditions worsens. It is in
such cases that blockchain is more impactful.
