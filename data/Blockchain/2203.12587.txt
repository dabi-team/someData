Abstract—Our study empirically predicts the bubble of
non-fungible tokens (NFTs): transferable and unique digital
assets on public blockchains. This topic is important because,
despite their strong market growth in 2021, NFTs on a
project basis have not been investigated in terms of bubble
prediction. Specifically, we applied the logarithmic periodic
power law (LPPL) model to time-series price data associated
with four major NFT projects. The results indicate that, as
of December 20, 2021, (i) NFTs, in general, are in a small
bubble (a price decline is predicted), (ii) the Decentraland
project is in a medium bubble (a price decline is predicted),
and (iii) the Ethereum Name Service and ArtBlocks projects are
in a small negative bubble (a price increase is predicted). A
future work will involve a prediction refinement considering
the heterogeneity of NFTs, comparison with other methods,
and the use of more enriched data.

I. Introduction
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are “transferable and unique
digital assets on public blockchains” [1]1 developed as an ex-
tension to cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin; BTC [6]), enabling
decentralized consensus-building on transaction records. Un-
like fungible (homogeneous) cryptocurrencies2, NFTs can be
unique digital assets (e.g., arts, games, collectibles, etc.), once
they are associated with unique metadata or images [5], [10].
In practice, NFTs are often minted on a project basis as a
group of similar images. For example, CryptoPunks—one of
the earliest NFT projects—minted 10,000 NFTs, each with
a human face drawn on a 24 × 24 pixel image (Fig. 1).
According to coinmarketcap.com, there are currently at least
1,056 such projects on Ethereum (ETH) [2], [3]3.

One of the most notable features of NFTs (at the time
of writing this paper) is their strong market growth. Fig. 2

1Other definitions may not limit NFTs to those used in the public
blockchain, or conversely, may limit NFTs to those used in the Ethereum
[2], [3] public blockchain. For example, “An NFT is a unit of data stored
on a blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not
interchangeable” [4], “Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a type of cryptocurrency
that is derived by the smart contracts of Ethereum” [5].

2Note that several studies (e.g., [7]–[9]) have pointed out that cryptocur-
rencies, where all transaction records are public, are non-fungible because
their values can vary between those that went through a particular address
and those that did not.

3If other blockchains (e.g., Binance Smart Chain and Solana) are included,

the number of projects increases to 1,998.

Fig. 1: Several NFTs Minted by CryptoPunks

presents the monthly volume of NFTs traded in the world’s
largest NFT marketplace OpenSea. We can clearly observe a
huge market growth trend since 2021, especially in August.
The same trend has also been observed in luxury NFTs traded
outside the OpenSea. Table I shows the ranking of the most
expensive NFTs traded on seven marketplaces (SuperRare,
Nifty Gateway, Foundation, hic et nunc, MakersPlace, KnownO-
rigin, and Async Art), where the prices of the top five NFTs
were all recorded in 2021. These trends of strong market
growth naturally lead people to question whether the current
NFT market is a bubble [11], [12] or what the future price
movements will be [13], [14].

To answer these questions, this study attempts a bubble
prediction of NFTs, especially for each project. Specifically,
we applied the logarithmic periodic power law (LPPL) model
[15]–[17]—a standard method for bubble prediction—to time-
series price data associated with four major NFT projects.
These data were retrieved from nonfungible.com (see Section
III for details). The results imply that, as of December 20,
2021, (i) NFTs, in general, are in a small bubble (a price
decline is predicted), (ii) the Decentraland project is in a
medium bubble (a price decline is predicted), and (iii) the
Ethereum Name Service and ArtBlocks projects are in a small
negative bubble (a price increase is predicted). The analysis

projects and that in emerging projects4. Moreover, Ante [18]
and Dowling [19], [20] investigated the spillover between
NFTs and cryptocurrecies. The former author found Granger
causalities from BTC price to NFT sales, from ETH price to
the number of active NFT wallets, and from BTC price to
ETH price. On the other hand, the latter author pointed out
that there is little causality between NFTs and cryptocurrecies
with respect to price volatilities.

Regarding this research topic, our study has an academic
significance in terms of covering the bubble prediction, while
focusing on NFT markets.

B. Bubble Prediction on Cryptocurrencies

Bubble prediction on cryptocurrencies, especially BTC, has
been a popular topic since we can directly apply preceding
techniques used in the traditional financial markets.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, Macdonell [21]
presented the first study on this topic and applied the
LPPL model to weekly moving-average BTC prices (from
July 2010 to August 2013), thereby predicting the bubble
crash in December 2013. Subsequent studies have extended
this approach in various ways, such as applying the LPPL
model to other cryptocurrencies [22], [23], adding new terms
into the model [24], [25], and modifying the model itself
to accommodate highly-volatile BTC price data [26]. The
LPPL model is the standard, but not the only method for
bubble prediction. Preceding studies have also adopted other
methods, including the augmented Dickey-Fuller test [24],
[27], [28], sentiment analysis [29]–[31], and machine learning
[32]–[34]5.

Regarding this research topic, our study has an academic
significance in terms of covering NFT markets, while focusing
on the bubble prediction.

C. Bubble Prediction on DeFi and NFTs

In parallel with our study, the scope of bubble prediction
is being extended from cryptocurrencies to decentralized
finance (DeFi) [36] and NFTs.

Maouchi et al. [37] presented the first study on this
topic and pointed out fundamental properties of DeFi and

4Ante [1] found that the decreasing number of active wallets in emerging
projects causes an increase in the number of active wallets in established
projects and vice versa.

5For more information, see Kyriazis et al. [35], a survey paper that covers
not only predictions, but the entire phenomenon of cryptocurrency bubbles.

presented here is relatively intuitive and, to the best of
the authors’ knowledge, is the first empirical investigation
focusing on the bubble prediction of NFT projects.

This paper consists of six sections, including the intro-
duction. Section II covers the related research work; Section
III details the retrieved time-series price data; Section IV
describes the LPPL model for the bubble prediction; Section
V shows the results and their implications; finally, Section VI
concludes this study and outlines future research directions.

II. Related Research Work

A. Empirical Study on NFT Markets

Thanks to the transparency of transaction records, empiri-
cal studies on NFT markets, using richer data (both in quality
and quantity), are now emerging.

Nadini, et al. [4] presented the first empirical study on
NFTs. In this study, massive transaction data (6.1 million
NFT trades between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021)
were comprehensively analyzed using a variety of methods,
including network analysis for community detection, neu-
ral networks for image classification, and linear regression
for price estimation. Ante [1] specifically focused on the
spillover effect among NFT projects and found a Granger
causality between the number of active wallets in established

NFT bubbles (e.g., they overlap with cryptocurrency bubbles
with the exception of summer 2020; they are less recurrent
but larger than cryptocurrency bubbles). Wang et al. [38]
elaborated this extension by using the augmented Dickey-
Fuller test and (supplementally) the LPPL model.

Regarding this research topic, our study has an academic
significance in terms of providing bubble prediction for each
project, while focusing on the NFT market.

III. Data
The time-series data used in this analysis are the weekly
moving-average prices of NFTs, which were retrieved from
nonfungible.com and displayed on a daily basis in US dollars.
The moving-average prices were extracted not only from
all available NFTs6
(from 2017-06-23 to 2021-12-20), but
also from each of the four major projects with different
time-scales and categories: Decentraland (from 2018-03-19 to
2021-12-20), CryptoPunks (from 2018-05-17 to 2021-12-20),
Ethereum Name Service (from 2019-05-04 to 2021-12-20), and
ArtBlocks (from 2020-11-27 to 2021-12-20)7. Fig. 3 plots the
retrieved data using log-scale values on the vertical axis. Our
analysis applies the LPPL model to each of these 1 + 4 time-
series price data.

The following simplifications are considered: (i) weekly
moving-average price data are used (instead of daily moving-
average data) to facilitate the application of the LPPL model
to the highly-volatile NFT market8; (ii) price data associated
with projects (or all available NFTs) are used (instead of those
associated with each NFT) to facilitate the application of
the LPPL model to the NFT market where each one has a
unique price9. In other words, it implicitly assumes that all
NFTs are homogeneous for each project. Relaxing these two
simplifications (which undermine the original characteristics
of the NFT market) is one of our future research directions.

IV. Methods

A. LPPL Model

The LPPL model

is designed to predict bubbles using
only time-series price data. Specifically,
it approximates
ln [p(t)]—the log-price of data at a given period t—as follows:

ln [p(t)] ≈ A + B(tc − t)m + C(tc − t)m
· cos[ω ln (tc − t) − φ],

(1)

where the right-hand side contains three linear parameters
(A, B, and C) and four nonlinear parameters (tc, m, ω, and
φ).

tc denotes the critical time at which the previous bubble
ends and a transition to another regime occurs10; A denotes

6According to nonfungible.com, over 8 million sales records from more

than 200 NFT projects have been tracked.

7All data are available from the Github repository.
8Macdonell [21] used weekly moving-average BTC price data, whereas

daily moving-average values were used in subsequent studies [22]–[26].

the log-price when t reaches tc; B denotes the magnitude
of the power law acceleration11; C denotes the magnitude of
the log-periodic oscillations (|C| < 1); m denotes the degree
of the power law acceleration; ω denotes the frequency of
oscillations during the bubble; φ denotes the time scale of
oscillations.

Namely, the LPPL model defines a bubble as the faster-
than-exponential (upward or downward) acceleration of p(t).

B. Calibration

The LPPL model can be calibrated using the ordinary least
squares method to provide estimations for all parameters
(A, B, C, tc, m, ω, and φ) in a given time window [t1, t2]. We
here employed an existing Python module for this calibration
and visualization.

To reduce the computational complexity, the calibration
initially uses the Filimonov and Sornette [40] method, which
eliminates the nonlinear parameter φ by expanding Equation
1 as follows:

ln [p(t)] ≈ A + (tc − t)m{B + C1 cos [ω ln (tc − t)]
+C2 sin [ω ln (tc − t)]},

(2)

where C1 = C cos φ and C2 = C sin φ12.

For the remaining nonlinear parameters tc, m, and ω, we
set the following conditions, which are derived from the
empirical evidence of previous bubbles and are commonly
adopted as the stylized features of the LPPL model [41]–[43]:

(cid:26)

2 < ω < 15.
The calibration for a given time window [t1, t2] ends if the
estimated parameters satisfy all the above stylized features13.
Then, bubble prediction can be made for each data period
by letting this calibration iterate for the shrinking time
window [t1, t2]. Here [t1, t2] is in daily units, according to
the daily basis data (Section III); t2 denotes a fictitious today
corresponding to t, and t1 denotes an earlier day. For a given
t2, the iterative calibration sets the initial range of the time
window to 120 days and the shrinking interval of t1 to 5
days. Thus, the parameters need to be estimated 24 times for
each t2 (e.g., [1, 120], [5, 120], · · · , [115, 120] for t2 = 120;
, [116, 121] for t2 = 121)14. It should

11Note that the power law acceleration works toward increasing prices if
B < 0 and toward decreasing prices if B > 0. The former case is denoted
as a positive bubble, whereas the latter case is denoted as a negative bubble
[39].

12Since |C| < 1, condition C2
13Accordingly, this calibration is stochastic rather than deterministic (i.e.,

market high volatility.

10The critical time is also called singularity. This is the reason the LPPL

model is also abbreviated as LPPLS model.

14Thus, this analysis exhibits a lag for approximately four months; the
results for all available NFTs (from 2017-06-23 to 2021-12-20) range from
2017-10-20 to 2021-12-20.

Fig. 3: The Time-Series Price Data Used in Our Analysis

be emphasized that this process (as a prediction) uses only
historical data as input data. The outcome of t2 depends only
on data from t2 to the last 120 days.

C. Bubble Indicator for Visualization

The LPPL model visualizes its own predictions as the
bubble indicator (or confidence indicator) [43]. For a given
t2 with 24 outcomes, the bubble indicator first counts the
number of B < 0 and B > 0 cases; the former implies
that the price increases faster than exponential (i.e., positive
bubble), whereas the latter implies that the price decreases
faster than exponential (i.e., negative bubble [39]). These
numbers are denoted as [B < 0]count and [B > 0]count for
convenience.

Next, the 24 outcomes are classified into B < 0 and B > 0
groups and filtered to obtain a higher degree of confidence
(thereby preventing the type I error). This process specifically
sets the following filter conditions for the nonlinear parame-
ters tc, m, and ω:

conditions in the B < 0 and B > 0 groups are denoted as
[B < 0]∗

and [B > 0]∗

, respectively.

Finally, the bubble indicators (for a given t2) can be

computed as follows:

where bubbleindicator(pos) indicates the percentage of a
positive bubble of the price at t2 in the [0, 1] range, which
quantifies the possibility of a price decline in the near
future. On the other hand, bubbleindicator(neg) indicates
the percentage of a negative bubble of the price at t2 in
the [0, 1] range, which quantifies the possibility of a price
increase in the near future15.

The LPPL model derives these positive and negative bubble
indicators for all t2, thereby visualizing its own predictions.

V. Results

The prediction results are summarized in Fig. 4. Figs. 4a-
4e correspond to the aforementioned 1 + 4 time-series price
data, where bubbleindicator(pos) is depicted in red and
bubbleindicator(neg) in green.

Overall, the LPPL model appears to predict the trend of
both positive and negative bubbles in NFT markets. The
results obtained considering all the available NFTs (Fig. 4a)
show that the LPPL model is generally successful in predict-
ing the direction of price changes, although prices rise further
after bubbleindicator(pos) reaches its highest value in late
August 2020. This is true for individual projects as well;
bubbleindicator(neg) successfully predicts the shift to an up-
ward price trend after July 2021, which is common across the
Decentraland (Fig. 4b), CryptoPunks (Fig. 4c), and Ethereum
Name Service (Fig. 4d), although bubbleindicator(pos) fails
to predict the continuous price increase of the CryptoPunks
(Fig. 4c) from around October 2020 to March 2021.

After confirming the accuracy of the LPPL model, let us
focus on the latest indicators. Near December 20, 2021, the
bubble indicators provide signals in four cases, except for
CryptoPunks (Fig. 4c); bubbleindicator(pos) ≈ 0.2 in all
available NFTs (Fig. 4a), bubbleindicator(pos) ≈ 0.4 in the

15Here, the bubble indicator is regarded as zero if the denominator ([B <

0]count or [B > 0]count) is zero.

Decentraland (Fig. 4b), and bubbleindicator(neg) ≈ 0.1 in
the Ethereum Name Service (Fig. 4d) and ArtBlocks (Fig. 4e).
These results imply that, as of December 20, 2021, (i) NFTs,
in general, are in a small bubble (a price decline is predicted),
(ii) the Decentraland project is in a medium bubble (a price
decline is predicted), and (iii) the Ethereum Name Service and
ArtBlocks projects are in a small negative bubble (a price
increase is predicted).

VI. Conclusion

In this paper, we empirically predicted the bubble of
NFTs, by applying the LPPL model to the time-series price
data associated with four major NFT projects. The results
indicated that, as of December 20, 2021, (i) NFTs, in general,
are in a small bubble (a price decline was predicted), (ii)
the Decentraland project is in a medium bubble (a price
decline was predicted), and (iii) the Ethereum Name Service
and ArtBlocks projects are in a small negative bubble (a
price increase was predicted). To the best of the authors’
knowledge, this is the first empirical investigation focusing
on the bubble prediction of NFT projects.

On the other hand, this study, as a first step of the pre-
diction, needs further investigation to obtain more accurate
results. The following three potential research directions are
outlined:

A. Consideration of the NFTs Heterogeneity

We assumed that, to facilitate the application of the LPPL
model, all NFTs are homogeneous for each project (Section
III). However, NFTs are inherently unique and heterogeneous,
and this is exactly what differentiates NFTs from cryptocur-
rencies (and legal tender). Therefore, it is worth addressing
to develop a new prediction method which will take into
account the heterogeneity of NFTs.

B. Comparison with Other Methods

The LPPL model is only one of the available methods for
bubble prediction. Other methods, such as the augmented
Dickey-Fuller test, the sentiment analysis, and machine learn-
ing (Section II), can also be used. Using these methods and
comparing their results would be another future research
direction. Moreover, we need to find the best mix of the
preceding methods to achieve the best accuracy of NFT
bubble prediction. In this case, a variety of data (other than
time-series price) would be required as input data.

C. Use of More Enriched Data

Our prediction deals with only four major NFT projects,
although it uses the weekly moving-average prices of all
available NFTs (Section III). More enriched data obtained
from other projects would refine the analysis. In addition,
although weekly moving-average prices (to address the high
volatility) were used, it would be important to develop new
methods that can make use of daily or hourly time-series
price data as input data.
