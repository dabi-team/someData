Abstract 

As known, blockchains are traditionally blind to the real world. This implies the reliance on third parties called oracles 
when  extrinsic  data  is  needed  for  smart  contracts.  However,  reintroducing  trust  and  single  point  of  failure,  oracles 
implementation is still controversial and debated.  The blindness to the real world makes blockchains also unable to 
communicate with each other preventing any form of interoperability. An early approach to the interoperability issue is 
constituted by “wrapped tokens,” representing blockchain native tokens issued on a non-native blockchain. Similar to 
how oracles reintroduce trust, and single point of failure, the issuance of wrapped tokens involves third parties whose 
characteristics  need  to  be  considered  when  evaluating  the  advantages  of  “crossing-chains”.  This  paper  provides  an 
overview  of  the  wrapped  tokens  and  the  main  technologies  implemented  in  their  issuance.  Advantages,  as  well  as 
limitations, are also listed and discussed.

1.  Introduction 

“Bitcoin can’t speak the language of Ethereum and vice versa……we can’t spend bitcoin on the Ethereum network, nor 
can we make use of Ethereum’s smart contracts on the Bitcoin network” [1]. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for 
blockchains, and each distinct ecosystem offers differences in scalability, security, programmability, and privacy. The 
different  needs  of  their  users  then  justbiify  the  heterogeneity  of  coexisting  separate  platforms,  but  from  a  financial 
perspective, their inability to communicate means that the related capital is not completely exploitable for DeFi purposes 
[2]. As a matter of fact, interoperability across chains wasn’t integrated into the original idea of blockchain protocols; 
however,  as  technology  grew,  the  need  for  cross-chain  solutions  arose  [3].  Interoperability  would  grant  users 
accessibility,  speed,  and  fees  reduction.  Having  BTC,  the  most  hyped  crypto  asset  on  the  Ethereum  network,  for 
example,  and  including  it  in  smart  contracts  was  quite  a  fascinating  idea,  and  it  has  been  possible  thanks  to  the 
introduction  of  wrapped  tokens  [4][5].  Wrapped  tokens  were  proposed  as  a  means  to  overcome  the  absence  of 
communication  between  different  blockchains  [6].  According  to  the  DeFi  Pulse  website,  one  of  the  most  reliable 
resources for statistic analysis on DeFI, it emerges that more than 270,000 BTC (September 2021) are actually being 
used in DeFi as Wrapped Tokens [7]. The same website also shows that 80% of wrapped bitcoins are WBTC, while the 
remaining  part  is  provided  by  other  or  emerging  companies/platforms.  It  is  a  huge  amount,  considering  how  much 
bitcoin is worth, but since the total circulation of bitcoin is over 18M, those used as wrapped tokens are still less than 
2%. Lately, the offer of wrapped tokens is increasing, and many companies such as Tron, Binance, Klever, Solana, and 
Tezos are offering their cross-chain proposal [6], [8], [9]. Although all of these are based on the implementation of 
wrapped tokens, the bridging process slightly differs. With the technology available today, bridging an asset to another 
blockchain means locking the original asset on its own blockchain and minting a copy on another that is not naturally 
compatible [10]. 

This paper aims to explain the idea behind the creation of wrapped tokens, outlining their role, use, and drawbacks. The 
first known examples, such as WETH, WBTC renBTC will be discussed to understand the differences among the entities 
involved  in  their  management  [11]–[13].  Other  approaches  such  as  Synths  and  Layer2  solutions  will  be  discussed, 

analyzing the case of Synthetix and Secret network [14], [15]. The scope of this paper is to give a broad overview of 
the concept of wrapped tokens to facilitate further theoretical and empirical studies on this subject. In the absence of 
academic resources on the subject, only grey literature could be reviewed. From the analyzed examples, it emerges that 
a real bridge between blockchains still doesen’t exist, but wrapped tokens constitute an effective workaround till this 
feature is developed. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section outlines the history of wrapped tokens and their 
predecessors. Section three outlines some of the most promising solutions in the field, while section four discusses their 
characteristics, analyzing strengths  and  weaknesses. Section five concludes the  paper  by  providing  hints for  further 
research.  

2.  Understanding wrapped tokens 

To better understand the concept of wrapped tokens, it may be helpful to introduce the concept of wrapped “asset” first. 
The wrapped asset is a token that represents a real-world or crypto asset, and it is backed by the represented asset or 
assets of equal value [16]. The backing asset is put in a vault called a “wrapper” (hence wrapped asset) [10]. It is issued 
on a blockchain, and it is supposed to keep the same value as the represented asset. Tokenizing an asset means converting 
its structure to a blockchain-compliant one so that smart contracts can manage it. The underlying idea of a wrapped 
asset is that since it is impossible to physically move an asset to the blockchain or make it blockchain compliant, a token 
representing the asset is created instead. Of course, to avoid double-spending, the real-world assets should be locked till 
it’s “avatar” is used on the blockchain. Examples of wrapped assets are the so-called stablecoins [17]. The stablecoins 
are tokens that represent stable assets and are particularly useful in DeFi, given the usual volatility of cryptocurrencies. 
In blockchain-based financial applications, fiat currencies were considered useful to hedge against the risk of volatility. 
Unfortunately,  those  could  not  be  directly  imported  into  smart  contracts  for  being  in  the  real  world  and  having  no 
blockchain-compliant characteristics. Therefore, in order to have those stable assets on the blockchain, a representation 
of  these  had  to  be  created  with  blockchain-compliant  characteristics.  USD-T  and  USD-C  are  two  stablecoins, 
respectively, issued by Tether Foundation and Centre organization [18], [19]. The issuing organizations are in charge 
of  guaranteeing  the  peg  of  those  cryptocurrencies  to  the  US  dollar.  In  principle,  in  order  to  mint  stablecoins,  an 
equivalent  amount  of  dollars  or  financial  assets  should  have  been  “held”  by  trusted  entities  chosen  by  the  issuing 
companies. The centralization of control of those currencies and the absence of a transparent proof of assets makes 
communities reluctant to consider those as properly wrapped assets [20]. Stablecoins that are more widely recognized 
as wrapped assets are synthetic or decentralized ones such as sUSD, DAI, USD-J [21], [22]. The sUSD is a stablecoin 
issued by Synthetix when staking SNX native token and has a collateralized ratio of 400%. It means that to mint 10 
sUSD, at least 40$ of SNX needs to be locked. DAI and USD-J, are decentralized projects issued by MakerDAO and 
JUST-GOV, respectively. Those allow the issuance of stablecoins by collateralizing assets into a smart contract with at 
least  150%  ratio.  The main  difference  between  the  first  group  of  stablecoins (USD-T,  USD-C)  and  the  second  one 
(sUSD, DAI, USD-J) is that; while the first involves a centralized authority and does not offer a transparent proof of 
asset, the second is fully managed by smart contracts and the proof of asset is available on-chain.  

Wrapped tokens are a particular category of wrapped assets that is not intended to create a crypto representation of real-
world assets such as gold, stock, or fiat currencies but of other crypto assets instead (e.g., Bitcoin, BNB, Ether) [23]. 
The reason for their existence is because, as blockchains are entirely isolated from the external world, they are also 
isolated from each other. Therefore, as there is no way to bring dollars on Ethereum blockchain and stablecoins are used 
instead, there is also no means to bring bitcoin to Ethereum, and wrapped tokens must be used instead [24]. Although 
hypothesized and desirable, the communication and interoperability between blockchain are impossible with the actual 
technologies, and cryptocurrencies cannot “jump” from one chain to another. The limitation of interoperability is then 
addressed  with  the  same  solution  as  bringing  real-world  assets  to  the  blockchain,  creating  a  “crypto-copy”  of  the 
required asset. So, the solution to use bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain was creating an asset on Ethereum with ERC-
20 standard (Ethereum Request for Comments 20) and “pretend” that it is bitcoin. There are several reasons to aim and 
promote  interoperability  between  the  two  chains  and  of  blockchains,  in  general  [25].  First,  despite  the  interest  of 

investors in Ethereum and altcoins, the highest portion of liquidity is still retained by bitcoin [26]. Therefore, while in 
centralized exchanges, almost all the trading pairs are with bitcoin, in decentralized exchanges, the trading pairs are 
with Eth, Sol, Trx, Waves, and so on, reaching together a much lower volume of trade than bitcoin alone [27]. This 
creates a lack of liquidity for decentralized exchanges with respect to centralized exchanges. Second, blockchains such 
as bitcoin are characterized by low scalability and high transaction fees during congestion time. Therefore, it is not 
suitable for a constant large volume of transactions or microtransactions [28]. Actually is already unprofitable to move 
an amount lower than 100$ on the bitcoin network. Lastly, crypto  belonging to different ecosystems (e.g., Polkadot, 
Ethereum, Tron) does not adhere to the same standards. Therefore, they are not suitable for being managed by the same 
smart contract. Furthermore, even in the same ecosystem, tokens may belong to different standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-
223, TRC-10, TRC-20, BEP2), resulting in the same lack of interoperability.  

Bridging separate blockchain and especially bridging bitcoin to other blockchains would solve the problem of liquidity 
that decentralized finance is experiencing. The capital hold in bitcoin could also be finally used to obtain an interest 
over its simple appreciation. Bridging blockchains would also  decrease latency and the cost of transactions. Bitcoin 
network has slow block time and high fees (1/10 block/minute, and around 30$/transaction), while using bitcoin on the 
Tron network, for example, would mean moving them almost for free with a block time of roughly three seconds [29], 
[30]. In the end, the bitcoin standard only allows basic scripts and not smart contracts, making it impossible to operate 
on the Bitcoin network the same kind of DeFi contracts available on Ethereum. Although the use of wrapped tokens is 
still  debated  in  online  forums  [31],  their  use  is  perceived  useful  to  address  the  above-mentioned  issues  while  an 
appropriate cross-chain solution is ever developed.  

Minting copies of bitcoin (or other crypto assets) on a non-native blockchain such as Ethereum is not a difficult task. 
The troublesome and difficult part is to ensure the peg of the minted token to the wrapped asset and that this peg is 
maintained over time. At the moment, three are the means through which the peg is enforced. 

Centralized: This method relies on one or more trusted organizations to maintain the wrapped token's value. The third 
parties are in charge of providing the so-called Proof of Asset (PoA). The PoA proves that the locked assets are safely 
stored and not used in any other applications. The auditability must be kept over time without any access restriction, 
and the companies have to ensure that the wrapped assets can be redeemed for the corresponding assets at any time [3], 
[10]. 

Trustless:  Wrapped tokens can be issued by fully decentralized entities such as smart contracts. They automatically 
manage the request, minting, burning, and custody of tokens. Being smart contracts, they are naturally trustless and 
ensures on-chain proof of assets [6], [32].  

Hybrid: This method uses both a centralized entity and a smart contract to issue wrapped tokens. The presence of a 
centralized entity is usually required to perform necessary tasks that smart contracts are still unable to do (e.g., KYC).  

Synthetic: This method slightly differs from the previous one as it does not require the lock of the original asset in a 
trusted vault or a smart contract. In order to mint a synthetic wrapped token, the user needs to lock an amount of assets 
of  the  equivalent  value  or  more.  Intuitively,  when  the  user  wishes  to  burn  the  wrapped  token,  will  not  receive  the 
represented token back but the provided assets instead [5]. 

Those are the known methods for issuing wrapped tokens and ensuring the peg to the original asset. However, there are 
drawbacks to every method that should not be underestimated. Centralized issuance of tokens means that users are fully 
dependent on the intermediary to keep their assets. Therefore, a considerable degree of trust is required to rely on those 
institutions and contracts. Trustless alternatives are so-called in the sense that there is not a centralized entity to trust. 
Users are ensured that no other player can run away with their money or defy the contract. However, as already happened 
in  the  past  for  other  smart  contracts,  those  can  be  bugged  or  experience  malfunction.  In  that  case,  although  not 
determined by a central authority, the loss of funds is definitely possible. Hybrid solutions reduce but do not prevent 

both drawbacks. The presence of a central authority can ensure assistance in case of contract malfunction, and on the 
other  hand,  the  automation  of  contracts  can  ensure  a  higher  level  of  operation  transparency.  Again  the  problem  of 
centralization or bugs still remains. Synthetic wrapped tokens are quite controversial and will be discussed in a dedicated 
paragraph. The next section analyzes practical cases of wrapped tokens to distinguish the main typologies better.  

3.  Projects of wrapped tokens 

3.1 Wrapped Ether (WETH)  

Although counterintuitive, on the Ethereum network, it also exists a wrapped version of Ethereum itself called WETH. 
It  is  actually  the  first  wrapped  token  ever  created  and  became  live  in  January  2018.  Since  decentralized  platforms 
running  on  Ethereum uses smart  contracts  to  facilitate  trades,  every asset should  conform to  the  same  standardized 
format. This format is recognized as ERC-20. Since Ether was built before the ERC-20 format, it is not suitable for 
DeFi  smart  contracts, and for this  reason, a  tokenized  version  of  ETH  (WETH)  was  perceived  necessary [11].  The 
wrapping of Ether is quite easy and intuitive when compared to other coins because Ether and WETH belong to the 
same ecosystem. Unlike the wrapping of other assets and cryptocurrencies, no interoperability issues arise since  no 
cross-chain transaction is needed. The need to wrap Ether, in this case, is given by the necessity of changing its standard. 
As shown in figure 1, the process is a simple swap between Ether and WETH which is made at 1:1 plus gas fees paid 
in eth. On the other hand, WETH as an ERC-20 token can no longer be used to pay gas fees. The swapped Ether is then 
held in the smart contract, which is publicly auditable [33]. The process is completely decentralized and, unlike other 
wrappings, does not involve third-party trusted custodial services. Although WETH, is widely used, as stated on the 
WETH website, “Hopefully, there is no future for WETH” [11]. There is the intention, in fact, to make Ether compatible 
with ERC-20 standards. However, other standards such as ERC-223 are also arising.  

Finally, It is important to point out that today the acronym WETH is also used for Ether, used on other blockchains. 
Therefore, WETH standard is actually heterogeneous (e.g., TRC-20, BEP-20).  

Figure 1. WETH minting 

         3.2 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)  

Although WETH was the first wrapped token by chronological order, the concept of wrapped tokens is associated with 
the announcement in late 2018 of a partnership between Kyber Network, BitGo, and Republic Protocol [34] to launch 

 
a wrapped version of bitcoin. Kyber Network is a decentralized liquidity aggregator proposing the best exchange rates 
from the supported Dexes, such as Skyscanner proposes the best prices for flights scanning all the supported flight 
companies  [35].  BitGo,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  company  specialized  in  custodial  services  for  cryptocurrencies  and 
enabling institutional investments in the crypto space [36]. The Republic Protocol is finally a company specialized in 
the transaction and swap between bitcoin and token of the Ethereum network. It is focused on the handling of a large 
quantity of capital offering OTC services [37]. The three companies finally launched the WBTC project in January 
2019, when the DeFi sector was still immature but managed to attract 1$ Billion of collateralized assets at his launch 
and even 7$ Billion by May 2021 [29]. The idea promoted by those companies was to create a stablecoin pegged 1:1 at 
the value of a crypto asset that could be utilized on a non-native blockchain. The proposed ecosystem to handle WBTC 
was composed of the following entities: 

Custodian. In this case, BitGo, has the task of hold and monitor the token delivered as collateral. It is a specialized 
company that is meant to offer the highest security standards. It has to provide all the necessary transparency to perform 
auditing procedures on the collateralized assets. The custodians actually perform the “wrapping and unwrapping” part 
of the whole process [29]. It can either be a centralized company or also a smart contract, such as in the case of WETH 
[23]. 

Merchant.  It  is  the  intermediary  between  the  custodian  and  the  user  (figure  2).  For  WBTC  this  role  was  initially 
managed  by  Kyber  and  Republic  Protocol.  It  receives  the  request  from  the  user  and  delivers  the  collateral  to  the 
custodian. When the minting process is completed, it also delivers the wrapped token to the users. The merchant is also 
involved in the reverse process when receives the burning request from the user. In that case, it handles the wrapped 
token to the custodian returning the unwrapped token to the user [24]. In the case of WBTC, the custodian is also the 
entity in charge of executing KYC procedures. 

User. is the entity in need of a wrapped token. It can be a private user or an institution. Given the characteristics of a 
wrapped token, the scope of the conversion is mainly speculative as the token loses all the original features in exchange 
for interoperability. The user initiates the request to the merchant that in turn involves the custodian. Basically, to receive 
the wrapped token, the user has to entrust his tokens to the merchant and pay the fees to both merchant and custodian. 
In case the user wishes to receive his token back, it has to initiate the burning request and pay the fees again.  

Governance In the specific case of WBTC the governance of the contract is managed by an “M of N” multi-signature 
wallet whose key owners are the member of the so-called “WBTC DAO”. The governance is in charge of handling the 
contract  and  the  addition  and  removal  of  custodians  and  merchants.  All  custodians  and  merchants  will  be  DAO 
members, but other institutions can also be included without a custodian or merchant role. In “M of N” wallets, M is 
the required  number  of  signatures, and  N is the total number  of members.  The values  of  M and  N  will be  decided 
mutually between members keeping in mind security as well as the ease of adding/removing members [30]. 

Figure 2. WBTC minting process 

          3.3 Ren Project 

source: https://wbtc.network/  

The  Republic  Protocol  (one  of  the  WBTC  DAO  members)  has  launched  the  Ren  Project  to  promote  cross-chain 
interoperability [38]. Whilst Republic Protocol is also involved in the minting process of WBTC, the bitcoin created 
within the RenVM application are named renBTC. The difference between the minting process of WBTC and renBTC 
is that it is completely automated, and users can directly bridge their crypto to a different blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, 
BinanceSmartChain), without performing KYC procedures. Assets are sent to the custodian's address, and the smart 
contract handles all the processes as well as the fees. The minted wrapped assets are then delivered at the user address 
corresponding to the destination ecosystem. The RenVM  smart contract automates the role of the merchant and the 
custodian. Moreover, suppose a user wishes to transfer a renBTC from one ecosystem to another(e.g., from Ethereum 
to  Solana).  In  that  case,  the  protocol  just  burns  the issued tokens  and mints  the same  quantity (-fees)  on the  newly 
requested one. At the moment, the project supports few assets and ecosystems, but the developer teams declared the 
intention to add more [39]. It is important to note that although WBTC and renBTC, are representations of the same 
token (BTC) which in principle is fungible, the difference in the name with respect to WBTC plays a crucial role. By 
the time the user has his assets wrapped on the designed network acquires the right to invest them and to trade those for 
other tokens. However, selling a WBTC does not have the same meaning as selling BTC. What a holder of WBTC 
transfers by selling the token is the right to redeem the locked token for the same amount of owned wrapped tokens. We 
recall that the ability to redeem the locked asset is the reason why the wrapped token maintains the exact peg. Therefore 
since the locked token may be in “custody” of a different entity, it is vital to distinguish those by naming them differently 
to ensure their non-fungibility. WBTC, for example, cannot be redeemed through the RenVM, since they do not have 
the corresponding tokens in their custody.  

Following the ren Project, other companies such as Binance launched its Project Token Canal to facilitate the issue and 
binding of more token assets on Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain, and guarantee the conversion from and to the 

 
original tokens. The Binance bridge, for example, works very similarly to the RenVM, pointing, however, to different 
ecosystems (BinanceSmartChain, Ethereum, Tron) [20]. Above their decentralized bridge, however, users can receive 
wrapped tokens directly from the Binance exchange, withdrawing crypto to a non-native platform supported by Binance. 
However, there are two consequences to keep in mind when using this feature from a centralized exchange. Being KYC 
mandatory on  centralized exchanges, wrapped tokens will not be acquired privately.  Second, if  wrapped tokens are 
obtained from an exchange, the existence of a corresponding locked asset is also not guaranteed. However, as declared, 
by  binance,  all  the  funds  and  issued  tokens  are  covered  and  insured  by  the  so-called  SAFU  fund,  which  should 
correspond to 10% of all the deposits [40]. 

          3.4 Synthetic Tokens and sBTC 

A synthetic token is conceptually different from a wrapped token, although it may have the same standard (ERC-20) 
and probably the same price. The synthetic Bitcoin, is, for example, a derivative of the original token; therefore, its only 
function is to speculate on its price. We recall that a derivative is an asset that derives its value from an underlying asset 
or index [41]. Unlike the wrapped token, a synthetic token cannot be redeemed for the original token since no original 
token was locked in order to mint the synthetic version. However, the mechanism to issue a synthetic token such as 
sBTC is similar to the wrapped token. On the Synthetix platform, for example (figure 3), in order to mint sBTC, 800% 
of the minted asset has to be deposited in SNX token as collateral [4]. An oracle service is queried in order to obtain the 
BTC/USD exchange rate, which in the case of Synthetix is Chainlink. The collateral is then returned when the user 
returns  the  sBTC,  which  is  consequently  burnt.  It  is  also  possible  to  acquire  a  short  position  on  sBTC  depositing 
collateral in sUSD. In that case, however, the fluctuation on the sBTC price will affect the collateral deposited depending 
on  the  BTC  price.  Therefore,  the  quantity  of  sUSD  redeemed  will  differ  from  the  provided  amount  (-fees).  The 
advantage of utilizing a synthetic token is that the process is completely trustless and automated. Unlike the minting 
process of WBTC and renBTC, the issuance of sBTC does not involve a custodian that locks the crypto on a different 
chain.  The  process  is  automated  by  the  smart  contract  and  involves  already  interoperable  assets.  In  this  sense,  the 
issuance of sBTC is more similar to the issuance of WETH. However, the fact that the original token is not locked to 
mint the synthetic assets makes those tokens not as accepted as the wrapped versions [14]. It must be said that the 
synthetic token in its structure is not different from the wrapped token and actually has the same functionalities. What 
differs is its source and its acceptance.

           3.5 Secret Network 

Since the  creation  of  bitcoin,  the  cryptocurrency  world  has  had  the  task  of  balancing  privacy  and  transparency.  As 
blockchains are mostly public, we are witnessing the rise of firms specializing in auditing blockchain transactions. Their 
aim is to discover the owner of addresses and the motives of transactions.  Due to that increasing lack of privacy, in 
2014, the Enigma project was founded with the aim of providing privacy to smart contracts on Ethereum. In 2020 the 
enigma launched its own main-net with the name of Secret Network [42]. The secret network is based on Cosmos SDK, 
so it has the same consensus mechanism (delegated proof of stake) and the same block-time (6-7 seconds). Similarly, 
to  the  Binance chain,  it  consists  of  two parallel  ecosystems, of  which  one  is  public,  and one is  private. The  public 
ecosystem is mainly used to transfer and stake SCRT native tokens. Instead, the private ecosystem is used for privacy-
preserving applications developed on their protocol and to transact secret tokens. The most innovative part of the secret 
network is the implementation of a bridge that is very similar to the RenVM to enable interoperability between different 
ecosystems [43]. Instead of just wrapping tokens to be usable in another ecosystem, the secret network empowers a 
dedicated layer two ecosystem where all the wrapped tokens can interact (figure 4). Unlike RenVM, the secret bridge 
directly connects wallets supporting separate ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum and Secret). The users select the token and 
quantity that he wishes to bridge, and once the process is done, a snip-20 version (native token standard) of the locked 
token is minted on the secret network. The original token is locked in a smart contract on its platform, and the bridge 
should ensure its safety and auditability. Although the various tokens can interact together and be inserted in liquidity 
pools, those, just like WBTC and renBTC are non-fungible. It means that although with the same standard and on the 
same platform, tokens coming, for example, from the Ethereum platform cannot be redeemed on the Binance Chain. 
Therefore, a holder with two equal tokens coming from different ecosystems cannot merge them in his secret wallet. As 
explained for the Ren Project, this feature is crucial to ensure that the wrapped tokens are redeemed for the corresponding 
locked asset [15].

4.  Discussion 

The need for wrapped tokens is justified by the inability of blockchains to directly communicate with each other to 
overcome the lack of interoperability [1]. As described, the mean of minting wrapped tokens is very similar to that of 
minting stablecoins. Unlike custodial stablecoins, however, the minting is initiated by the users and not by institutions. 
On  the  other  hand,  they  cant  be  considered  similar  to  non-custodial  stablecoins  due  to  the  centralized  nature  of 
custodians [17]. The utilization of custodians is a very debated concept in the crypto space. As a matter of fact, the 
whole idea of decentralization and DeFi, should involve the ability of users  to have complete control of their assets 
without involving trusted third parties and without KYC requirements [44]. Due to AML reasons, custodians of crypto 
assets  are  obliged  to  request  KYC  from  users  depositing  collaterals.  Therefore,  the  process  of  minting  most  of  the 
wrapped tokens cannot be initiated without a KYC. As centralized entities, custodians activity is subject to regulation 
and may also be ceased or censored [10], [30], [45]. 

Users also have the choice of acquiring wrapped tokens privately on a decentralized exchange without submitting KYC 
procedures. However, as explained, the intrinsic value of the wrapped token lies in the right to redeem the corresponding 
locked asset. Therefore, although the token may have been acquired privately, KYC procedures cannot be avoided at 
the moment of token redemption. If in order to redeem WBTC the user has to undertake KYC procedure, the benefits 
of privacy given by the blockchain technology are forfeited. Projects such as Binance Bridge and RenVM, instead, do 
not require KYC when redeeming tokens [20]. However, as RenVM terms and conditions stated, regulations may always 
change procedures or even delete some [45]. This condition means that although the contract is apparently trustless and 
decentralized, the company managing the protocol may be ceased or be obliged to change some function at any time 
due  to  regulatory  hurdles.  Among  those  discussed  in  the  present  article,  the  only  wrapped  tokens  characterized  by 
privacy and trustless minting process appear to be synthetic tokens and those issued on Secret Network [14], [43].  

As already explained, the issuance of synthetic tokens is very similar to wrapped tokens. However, they are often non 
considered as such. Wrapped tokens ensure that the circulation of a specific token remains the same regardless of the 
chain on which it is operating. It means that if a WBTC is being lended on Ethereum, a BTC is contextually being frozen 
on the Bitcoin blockchain. This ensures that the supply remains the same and the price of both assets is safeguarded. 
For synthetic assets, however, this condition does not hold. As an example, synthetic bitcoin operating on Ethereum, 
does not have a counterparty locked on the Bitcoin network, de facto altering the total supply of BTC. This may be a 
reason why wrapped tokens still have a wider acceptance in DeFi platforms such as Compound and MakerDAO, with 
respect to synthetic tokens. Another important aspect to consider, which is rarely discussed, is the smart contract reliance 
on external oracle services [46]. Since the locked token is not the same as the synthetic token, an oracle service has to 
be  queried  to  obtain  the  token's  exchange  rates.  As  discussed in  many  papers,  those  oracle  services  are  centralized 
entities  prone  to  malfunction  and  manipulation  [47],  [48].  Therefore,  even  if  the  synthetic  contract  is  trustless  and 
automated, the reliance on a third-party service constitutes a single point of failure.  

Finally,  the  approach  implemented  by  Secret  Network  is  lately  being  seen  in  other  ecosystems  such  as  Tron  and 
BitTorrent [8]. Their idea is basically to create a layer two environment in which all the tokens have the same standard 
and can interact together. If this approach enables interoperability, on the one hand, it has considerable limitations on 
the other. First, as a stand-alone environment, it is not compatible with all the most prominent applications in the DeFi 
space based on Ethereum. The company is, in fact, developing its own applications, which at the moment counts less 
than 0.07% of the total capital invested in DeFi [7]. Convincing investors to switch from their trusted platform to a 
newly built one may not be an easy task. Second, the availability of wrapped assets is subject to the development of 
bridges. Bitcoin bridge, for example, is still not available; therefore, it is not possible to directly interact with bitcoin on 
the secret network. However, it is possible to bridge WBTC and renBTC from the Ethereum network. This option would 
mean wrapping the original token (bitcoin) actually two times. Third, as stated in the secret network F.A.Q., using a 
layer two network is not free of risks. Being a smaller network compared to Ethereum and bitcoin is more subject to 

attacks or unavailability of nodes. In case of network failures, there is the chance to lose all the tokens locked in the 
bridge [49].   

In the end, it is arguable that unlike bitcoin or dash, which can be considered decentralized currencies, a wrapped token 
is mainly issued and managed by organizations that “guarantee” their value and reconvertibility to the former token. 
The trust to put in the token issuer and the token itself is strictly related to the specific mechanism undertaken to mint 
the token, which varies according to the issuing company/authority.

5.  Conclusion 

The scope of this paper was to undertake a study on wrapped tokens. Wrapped tokens are a practical solution for cross-
chain communication and interoperability [50]. They also enable faster and more accessible alternatives for transactions 

 
 
 
when  a  particular  blockchain  is  experiencing  delays  or  high  fees.  Allowing  the  use  of  tokens  over  a  non-native 
blockchain can constitute an effective solution to bring liquidity for developing DeFi space [4]. Reducing transaction 
costs and speed can enable the microtransactions that were initially doable at the birth of blockchain and became soon 
unmanageable due to congestions and transaction fees. However, there are drawbacks to consider when interacting with 
those tokens that mainly concern the entities involved in their creation. Custodians, whose role is essential to keep the 
tokens  locked,  are  centralized  entities  subject  to  audits  and  regulations.  If,  on  the  one  hand,  this  guarantees  their 
trustworthiness, on the other hand, the pressure of regulation may alter the proposed service or even censor transactions. 
Other wrapped tokens may work without a custodian. Its role is de facto, replaced by a smart contract or virtual machine. 
Their use, although decentralized, is not risk-free since smart contracts are not exempt from errors and bugs [51]. 

Although the promise of wrapped tokens is to reduce fees, the truth is that this is not guaranteed. Wrapping bitcoin to 
Ethereum would result first in high minting costs, and then transactions would be subject to Ethereum fees that are not 
always lower than the bitcoin one [10]. Therefore, switching chain every time to reduce transaction costs seems not a 
convenient  option.  Nevertheless,  a  wrapped  version  of  a  coin  is  not  that  coin.  It’s  another  cryptocurrency  entirely. 
Therefore, most of their functionalities are forfeited. For example, some passive income platforms don’t take wrapped 
tokens, and neither do some exchanges and wallets. As explained, although counterintuitive, it is not possible to pay gas 
fees with WETH on the Ethereum network even if it is a wrapped token of Ether [50].  

As for the currently available technology, wrapped tokens can’t be used for true cross-chain transactions [32]. Just as in 
the case of oracles, the first approach to the problem is to reintroduce centralization in order to overcome the encountered 
issues.  The  examples  discussed  in  this  paper  show  that  the  offered  proposals  constitute  a  mere  workaround  to  the 
problem and not a definitive solution. In every case, there are some features to give up in exchange for interoperability. 
While WBTC needs trust over custodians, renBTC is eventually subject to smart contracts and regulatory pressures. 
Synthetic solutions are often debated for their minting process and their impact on the market. On the other hand, layer 
two solutions such as Necret Network require trust in a different network with different security and applications.  

The shared opinion is that the use of the wrapped token is temporary, and it will probably be abandoned when a true 
cross-chain solution is discovered [52]. Since it is not sure when and if full interoperability between blockchain may be 
reached, further studies over the security of interoperability tokens could be useful to understand their development and 
potential better.
