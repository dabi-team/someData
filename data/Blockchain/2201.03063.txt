Abstract—Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems undergo
a period of rapid development driven by the ever-increasing
user demands, reduced costs, and technological progress. Since
there is a paucity of literature on the security issues of LEO
Satellite Communication Systems (SCSs), we aim for ﬁlling this
knowledge gap. Speciﬁcally, we critically appraise the inherent
characteristics of LEO SCSs and summarize their unique security
vulnerabilities. In light of this, we further discuss their security
vulnerabilities, including the issues of passive and active eaves-
dropping attacks, interference scenarios, single event upsets, and
space debris. Subsequently, we discuss the corresponding active
and passive security countermeasures, followed by unveiling a
range of trade-offs, security vulnerabilities and their countermea-
sures. Furthermore, we shed light on several promising future
research directions for enhancing the security of LEO SCSs, such
as secure quantum communications, three-dimensional virtual
arrays, artiﬁcial
intelligence-based security measures, space-
based blockchain, and intelligent reﬂecting surface enabled secure
transmission. Finally, the take-away messages of this paper are
crystallized in our concluding design guidelines.

Index Terms—Active eavesdropping, interference, LEO SCS,
passive eavesdropping, security countermeasures, security vul-
nerabilities, single event upsets, space debris.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Brief review

Since the early 1980s, there has been a boom in launching
small satellites across the globe. Explicitly, by the end of
2021, more than 4700 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have
been successfully launched, accounting for nearly 86% of the
total launch volume of all types of satellites [1]. During these
years, LEO Satellite Communication Systems (SCSs) have
found a plethora of applications, including media broadcasting,

backhauling, mobile communication, and broadband Internet
[2]–[5]. In fact, LEO SCSs are capable of ﬁlling the coverage
holes of terrestrial systems and at the time of writing, they tend
to evolve towards a converged system, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1: Development process of LEO SCSs.

From the 1980s to 2000, some companies conceived satellite
constellation plans. Speciﬁcally, Iridium [6], GlobalStar [7],
and Orbcomm [8] aspired to build a global LEO constella-
tion for low-speed communication and to sell their satellite
communication terminals, so as to attract more users in their
competition with terrestrial systems. However, they failed to
construct a viable business case owing to their excessive initial
investment and a limited number of users [9].

Nevertheless, from 2000 to 2014, Iridium Next [10], Glob-
alStar, and Orbcomm provided uninterrupted mobile commu-
nication services for high-end users roaming in extreme desert,
open sea, and aviation scenarios that were not covered by
terrestrial systems. Nevertheless, the limited revenues affected
their wide-spread development [11].

However, as a beneﬁt of the ever-increasing demands [12],
reduced costs [13], and technological progress [14], LEO
mega-constellations, such as OneWeb, Starlink, Lightspeed,

are making a renewed effort for providing service for ‘the other
3 Billion’ who do not as yet have access to the Internet. They
are also capable of eminently suitable for providing backhaul
for terrestrial systems. These mega-constellations consist of a
large number of LEO satellites supporting communications up
to Gbps rates as well as a low delay of tens of milliseconds
(ms) [15]. Hence, integrating LEO satellites and terrestrial
systems is one of connectivity’s new frontiers [16]. The basic
features of a range of mega LEO SCSs are summarized in
Table I.

B. Serious Security Challenges

Although the development of LEO SCSs is in full swing,
mitigating their security vulnerabilities is set to increase in
importance. One of the most signiﬁcant weaknesses that are
common to all SCSs is the use of long-range telemetry for their
communication with gateways. Hence SCSs are vulnerable
to both eavesdropping and malicious jamming, as it was
demonstrated by eavesdropping on the Iridium network via a
Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR) device in [26]. A spokesman
of the Saudi satellite network said that its Egyptian subsidiary
was deliberately jammed when playing a comedy. The satellite
operator identiﬁed small satellite transmitters in a pair of
locations in Cairo as the source of this jamming [27].

Satellites are usually regarded as high-value Internet of
Things (IoT) devices, hence they are also vulnerable to hi-
jacking. For a few hundred dollars, hackers can set up a
sophisticated high-powered antenna to target and hijack a
satellite. Hackers were reported to have controlled SkyNet
satellites to extort ransom [28]. Russian hackers previously
hijacked commercial satellites to siphon sensitive data from
diplomatic and military agencies both in the United States
and in Europe [29]. If these compromised satellites are shut
down by hackers or even attack other expensive satellites, this
might lead to colossal political and ﬁnancial loss [30].

The space environment is also harsh and each space mission
is fraught with challenges. Many aircraft have failed before
accomplishing their missions. Cosmic radiation can heavily
affect electronic devices [31]. One of the most common effects
is the so-called Single Event Upsets (SEUs), which refers to
the response of a integrated circuit to a single radiation spin
that may cause a temporary failure or a change of state for
the IC.

However, the inherent characteristics make LEO SCSs suf-
fer from even more serious security challenges, as shown in
Fig. 2.

their orbit

Given the ongoing deployment of dense LEO mega-
is becoming increasingly over-
constellations,
crowded. At the same time, more and more spacecraft have
become abandoned as well, which poses threats for LEO
satellites in-orbit [32]. Additionally,
the dramatic increase
in the number of spacecraft will undoubtedly increase the
probability of collisions.

commercial viability of the system. The spectrum crunch
problem due to the scarcity of radio resources results in
inevitable spectrum coexistence between SCSs and terrestrial
systems. Moreover, the speciﬁc location of LEO satellites
may also lead to interference with Geostationary Earth Orbit
(GEO) SCSs. Typically, a large number of LEO satellites are
usually deployed at orbital altitudes of 160 to 2000 kilometers
(km), sandwiched between terrestrial systems and GEO SCSs.
Severe Co-channel Interference (CCI) may arise whenever
LEO satellites pass through the Line of Sight (LoS) path of
a GEO satellite in spectral coexistence scenarios. The CCI
between LEO satellites and terrestrial systems should also be
dealt with in Space-air-ground Integrated Network (SAGIN)
[33]. In addition, frequent launch activities have caused a surge
in LEO space debris, which poses severe challenges for the
operation of LEO satellites.

In contrast to GEO satellites, LEO satellites move at a high
speed relative to the Earth. The high mobility of LEO satellites
leads to frequent handovers among beams and satellites, which
makes the security issues more complex. Frequent handovers
require frequent authentication and security key handovers.
Illegal users may imitate legitimate users with criminal intent
[34], [35].

Again, the high mobility leads to severe Doppler effects,
which may signiﬁcantly deteriorate the system performance.
Hence the authors of [36] derived speciﬁc expressions for
characterizing the Doppler frequency shift, which may be ben-
eﬁcially exploited by sophisticated compensation techniques
for maintaining reliable communication.

The weight of LEO satellites usually does not exceed
1000 kilogram (kg) [37]. Hence LEO satellites have limited
computing power and storage, which precludes the use of com-
plex security algorithms designed for conventional terrestrial
systems. Traditional encryption-based authentication cannot
be directly applied to space-borne payloads. As a result, the
LEO satellite’s space-borne payload typically relies on low-
complexity security measures operated at the physical-layer.
With the continuous deployment of mega-constellations, the
number of LEO satellites has surged, hence it is a challenge
to manage a large number of high-speed ﬂying ‘base stations’.
With more satellites than ever in space, there are more attack
opportunities for hackers to compromise the nodes and to
threaten normally operating LEO satellites.

As a further potential

issue, a large number of

low-
speciﬁcation components used for LEO satellites are supplied
by civilian manufacturers both for cost savings, and for
reducing the production cycle. For instance, OneWeb is known
as another pioneer in the mass-production of satellites, whose
satellite factory is in Florida and will produce two satellites
per day [13]. However, loopholes in production methods and
inadequate testing may lead to potential defects in satellites.

C. Related Contributions

Spectrum is important for SCSs, because the bandwidth
and the propagation properties of the spectrum made available
as well as the usage conditions determine both the capac-
ity and the coverage quality, hence ultimately affecting the

Given the pivotal signiﬁcance of the security, there is a
plethora of technical papers aiming for tackling the afore-
mentioned security vulnerabilities. The timeline evolving from
2019 is seen in Fig. 3.

Fig. 2: The comparison of existing SCSs.

1) Eavesdropping: Lin et al. [38] proposed a robust secure
Beamforming (BF) scheme for maximizing the achievable
secrecy rate under the constraint of the total transmit power,
which is a challenging non-convex optimization problem. A
sequential convex approximation method was then employed
for transforming it into a linear problem associated with a
series of linear matrix inequalities and second-order cone
constraints. Then the optimal BF weight vectors were obtained
through an iterative algorithm. A low-complexity threshold-
based scheduling scheme was proposed by Guo et al. [39]
for enhancing the secrecy performance of multiuser SCSs.
Closed-form expressions were derived for the Secrecy Outage
Probability (SOP) and Average Secrecy Capacity (ASC) of the
system. Asymptotic expressions have also been obtained for
the SOP and ASC to get deeper insights at high Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR). Xu et al. [40] discussed the secure transmission
optimization of Intelligent Reﬂecting Surface (IRS)-assisted
satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. Speciﬁcally, an IRS
was employed for signal enhancement at the terrestrial network
user, for interference suppression at the satellite user, and for
degrading the reception at the eavesdropper.

2) Hijacking: There have been numerous contributions on
dealing with the issues of hijacking [41]–[43]. Yi et al.
[41] studied the vulnerability of intelligent early warning
technology in the context of IoT networks. Vieira et al. [42]
conceived an architecture for automated intrusion detection
based on Big Data, with a special emphasis on the classiﬁca-
tion, understanding, and prediction of behavioral irregularities
in distributed computing environments. He et al. [43] pro-
posed a novel blockchain-based technique, which eliminated
the security risks of a public key infrastructure. Hence it
was robust against preﬁx hijacking attacks. A sophisticated
amalgam of the credence value, collective signing, sharding,
and of a penalty mechanism was conceived for safeguarding
the consistency, scalability, and security of the system.

3) Node Compromise: A secure shortest path routing
scheme relying on a reliable risk control algorithm was pro-
posed by Wang et al. [44] for guarding against attacks by
compromised nodes, which may be identiﬁed by deploying
reputation-based systems. Chen et al. [45] considered the
potential of blockchain-aided solutions designed for protecting
the integrity of IoT networks. A stochastic blockchain-based
data checking scheme was used for replacing the existing
centralized approaches potentially leading to a single point of
failure and network congestion. Pacheco et al. [46] employed
artiﬁcial neural networks for intrusion detection in the context
of IoT fog nodes. Their simulation results showed that this
is a low-complexity scheme, imposing short execution time.
Mohammad et al. [47] conceived a resilient password manager
relying on physical unclonable functions, which harnessed
redundancy in the proposed prototype, for avoiding password
compromising events.

4) Interference: Su et al.

[48] proposed a coverage-
expansion method for LEO satellites supporting hybrid wide-
spot beam coverage for avoiding any interference with GEO
satellites. A heuristics-based Radio Resource Management
(RRM) algorithm was designed for mitigating the interference
between LEO and GEO satellites by Emiliano et al. [49],
which was tested in a software simulator. A novel spectrum
usage between GEO and LEO satellites was proposed by
Wang et al. [50], which struck an attractive trade-off between
the design complexity and the spectrum awareness accuracy.
Ge et al. [51] proposed a Non-orthogonal Multiple Access
(NOMA)-based GEO and LEO satellite network and employed
Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) for mitigating the
interference.

5) Jamming: Liao et al. [52] designed a robust BF algo-
rithm based on adaptive space-time processing for guarding
against malicious jamming, which reduced the sidelobe level at
a low complexity. A scheme based on classic Deep Reinforce-

ment Learning (DRL) and Stackelberg game-assisted spatial
anti-jamming was proposed by Han et al. [53] for the Internet
of Satellites. The communication countermeasures protecting
satellite users against jammers were modeled as a Stackelberg
anti-jamming routing game. Again, DRL techniques were used
to deal with the interaction between the satellites and the
jammers. Yang et al. [54] proposed a novel anti-jamming
model based on IRSs. Jointly optimizing the power allocation
and the IRS-based BF was formulated for enhancing the anti-
jamming performance. Weerackody et al. [55] proposed the
employment of satellite diversity for jamming mitigation in
LEO mega-constellations.

6) Single Event Upsets: Rigo et al.

[56] designed a
radiation-hardened reconﬁgurable hardware platform, which
has the ability to change the hardware conﬁguration of the
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) employed by relying
on the uplink control for mitigating the effect of SEUs. Mon-
real et al. [57] demonstrated that the periodic reconﬁguration
of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components have the
potential of mitigating the probability of SEUs. Gkiokas et al.
[58] proposed a fault-tolerant processor for SEU mitigation by
employing Triple Module Redundancy (TMR) voting applied
to the read/write operation along with memory scrubbing. Gao

et al. [59], [60] studied the fault tolerance of an SRAM-FPGA-
based Viterbi decoder and Turbo decoder.

7) Space Debris: Saito et al. [61] viewed orbit debris as
a kind of debt owed by the human race of existing gener-
ations to future generations. The debris removal ‘currency’
had the effect of transferring the corresponding credit to the
present day. Hence the authors proposed to utilize a new
digital currency associated with planned depreciation to build a
sustainable economic model of debris removal. Wei et al. [62]
proposed a multi-sensor space debris tracking scheme based on
generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli ﬁltering, which mitigated
the detection uncertainty, data association uncertainty, and
clutter in debris tracking. A reinforcement
learning-based
framework was conceived by Yang et al. [63] for solving the
debris removal mission planning problem. Cataldo et al. [64]
advocated the concept of multi-static radar for debris tracking.
Its cost was low because already existing instruments such as
illuminators and radio-telescopes were harnessed as receivers.
Against this backdrop, the objective of our paper is to
provide a comprehensive survey of the security of LEO SCSs.
Explicitly, the inherent characteristics, security vulnerabilities,
security countermeasures, and the associated future perspec-
tives are presented.

follows:

• We brieﬂy review the evolution of LEO SCSs and their
state-of-the-art, which is summarized in Table I at a
glance. Furthermore, we discuss their inherent charac-
teristics and outline their unique security challenges, as
well as the deleterious effects of interference and that of
space debris;

• Relying on recent research results we classify their secu-
rity vulnerabilities into ﬁve categories, including passive
and active eavesdropping attacks, as well as the impact
of interference, SEUs, and space debris. Furthermore, the
characteristics and impact of these security vulnerabilities
are analyzed and summarized in Table IV at a glance;
• As a remedy, we review a rich suite of security coun-
termeasures and classify them into active and passive
security countermeasures, depending on whether they can
proactively mitigate these security vulnerabilities.

• We illustrate the root causes of security vulnerabilities
and the implementation of security countermeasures by
carefully considering the trade-offs among numerous fac-
tors, such as the security, integrity, latency, complexity,
etc. Bearing these trade-offs in mind, we infer tangible
design guidelines;

• Finally, by analyzing the recent research results and
the above-mentioned vulnerabilities, we highlight several
promising future research directions,
including secure
three-dimensional (3D) vir-
quantum communications,
tual arrays, artiﬁcial intelligence-based security measures,
space-based blockchain, and intelligent reﬂecting surface
enabled secure transmission.

Indeed, there have been other security surveys and tuto-
rials published in [65]–[72]. However, i) to the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst survey that provides a compre-
hensive security overview of LEO SCSs, and ii) our paper
offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis ranging from information
security to space-borne payload protection. Our contributions
are boldly and explicitly contrasted to the other surveys in
Table II for explicitly identifying the gaps in the literature.

D. Paper Organization

The organization of this paper is illustrated in Fig. 4. In
Section II, the security vulnerabilities encountered by LEO
SCSs are categorized. Section III introduces the family of
active and passive security countermeasures conceived for
safeguarding LEO SCSs. In Section IV, some open problems
and research ideas concerning the security of LEO SCSs
are provided. Finally, our concluding remarks and design
guidelines for LEO SCSs are provided in Section V. The
acronyms used in this paper can be found in the Table IX
for convenience.

II. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

LEO SCSs support more and more civilian and military
applications, thus it is of paramount importance to eliminate
their security threats. In this section, we focus our discus-
sions on the security vulnerabilities of LEO SCSs shown in

Fig. 5 at a glance, which may be divided into the following
ﬁve categories: passive eavesdropping, active eavesdropping,
interference, SEU, and space debris. The ﬁrst three categories
also have their subclasses. These vulnerabilities will be further
detailed below.

A. Passive Eavesdropping

Passive eavesdropping aims for illegally obtaining conﬁden-
tial information during transmission. Hence their presence is
hard to detect. Passive eavesdropping is divided into overhear-
ing and transponder stealing, which will be introduced in more
detail below.

1) Overhearing: Again, the open nature of wireless prop-
agation makes legitimate transmissions vulnerable to eaves-
dropping, as seen in Fig. 6. The source transmits its sig-
nal to D, while E is capable of overhearing the legitimate
transmissions,
is located in the coverage area of S.
This indicates a clear trade-off between the security and the
integrity. Speciﬁcally, to improve the security of S, the con-
ventional approach is to reduce the transmit power. However,
the system’s integrity will also be reduced simultaneously.

Trade-offs

Fig. 5: Classiﬁcation of security vulnerabilities.

Conversely,
increasing the transmit power to improve the
desired link’s integrity, the probability of eavesdropping will
also be inevitably increased [73].

Typically, cryptography techniques are adopted to prevent
E from intercepting legitimate transmission between S and D.
However, owing to the limited signal processing capability
and power resources on-board of LEO satellites in the face
of the potentially high computing power of the adversary,
traditional cryptography is no longer a high-security solution.
As a remedy, the family of information-theoretic security mea-
sures has been conceived, which exploits the random physical
characteristics of wireless channels under the terminology
of physical-layer security, which has been recommended for
satellite-to-earth links, for example in [74]–[76].

2) Transponder Stealing: Transponder stealing constitutes
another passive eavesdropping technique seen in Fig. 7, under

which the eavesdropper adopts legitimate satellite transponders
information. If the compromised satellites do
to transmit
not perform any signal processing, they are only harnessed
for transparent forwarding [77]. Hence it is not possible to
determine whether the received data is from a legitimate
user. When attackers send their illegal signals, the satellite
will still forward the signals [78]. For example, the K3H
transponder of the Asian No.7 satellite suffered unknown
signal interference, some have suspected that hackers privately
exploited the satellite transponder for their transmission [79].
Moreover, it is a challenge for legitimate users to detect,
thus an eavesdropper, when it employs Direct Sequence Spread
Spectrum (DSSS) techniques at a low Power Spectral Density
(PSD) under the noise ﬂoor of the transponder’s receiver. The
authors of [80] proposed a sophisticated technique for tackling
this problem.

compromise attacks. These attacks are difﬁcult to detect and
mitigate, because they use hit-and-run tactics that originate
from numerous IoT vectors distributed around the world.
Furthermore, these compromised nodes may also trick other
legitimate nodes into compromised nodes [83]. It is chal-
lenging to detect compromised nodes, because the behaviour
of these compromised nodes and legitimate nodes is hard
to distinguish. Using code patches is a common method of
mitigating the probabilities of these events [65].

2) Hijacking: LEO SCSs provide a powerful platform for
military applications, which are hence prime targets for hostile
attacks. Their facilities on the ground are responsible for all
interactions with other terrestrial networks, and these facilities
create opportunities for hackers [28]. Additionally, low-cost
COTS components may also open the door for hackers. Some
satellite manufacturers, especially CubeSat, employ off-the-
shelf technology to reduce costs, and the widespread avail-
ability of these low-cost COTS components also reduces the
costs for hackers.

Furthermore, hackers can turn off satellites in batches by
taking over the telemetry, tracking, and control link of LEO
satellites, hence causing global service interruptions. They
thereby
may also block or spoof signals from satellites,
causing damage to critical infrastructures, such as power grids,
water supply networks, and transportation systems connected
to the Internet of satellites. Hackers could control satellites to
achieve self-destruction by malicious commands, or they can
use special tools to trick satellites and ultimately use them
to attack other satellites or space assets. Fortunately, there are
potent security countermeasures against hijacking attacks [84].

C. Interference

Interference can be roughly divided into two types: un-
intentional interference and intentional interference, both of
which degrade the quality of legitimate communications. To
elaborate, unintentional interference is caused by the deﬁcient
design of legitimate systems or inappropriate frequency man-
agement among systems, hence inﬂicting both intra-system
interference and inter-system interference. Intentional interfer-
ence known as jamming represents the radio signal transmitted
by the adversary, which falls into two categories: spooﬁng
jamming and energy-based jamming. Next, we will introduce
these four types of interference sources in more detail.

1) Intra-system Interference: Spread Spectrum (SS) tech-
niques are eminently suitable for LEO SCSs in military
applications, which are immune to most types of interference
to a certain extent. However, it is difﬁcult to avoid the near-
far effect caused by Multiple Access Interference (MAI) [85],
where a CCI degrades the designed signal. Power control and
multi-user detection are common methods of mitigating these
near-far effects [7]. Additionally, the careful choice of SS
codes may mitigate the near-far effects. Orthogonal comple-
mentary codes have been chosen to substantially mitigate MAI
[86]–[88]. However, these orthogonal codes are sensitive to
frequency shifts, which must be mitigated by future research.
Multi-beam satellites reuse the available frequencies within
their coverage to increase capacity. However, frequency reuse

in the presence of an eavesdropper (uplink).

B. Active Eavesdropping

Active eavesdropping aims for disrupting the operation of
legitimate systems by compromising or hijacking a node.
This is typically achieved by imitating legitimate users for
malicious access and communication [65]. Hijacking refers to
the case when attackers hack into ground facilities in order to
control satellites.

1) Node Compromise: In this scenario, a legitimate node
is attacked by an adversary under the control of malicious
algorithms, programs, or software, potentially threatening the
entire network. Attackers may harness these compromised
nodes for sending incessant requests, hence inducing network
congestion [81]. More speciﬁcally, for satellite-IoT applica-
tions supported by LEO SCSs, the power-limited terminals
operating without advanced security protection algorithms may
suffer from a high risk of being captured by an adversary. The
threat may be exacerbated by potential attacks from numerous
geographically dispersed adversaries.

The IoT botnet in which malware source code was leaked
in early 2015 is a typical paradigm of node compromise
attacks [82]. IoT botnets, created as hackers, infect numerous
them to launch large-scale node
IoT devices and recruit

some beams rely on the same frequency [89], especially in
adjacent beams using the same frequency. The angular side-
lobes of the beam radiation patterns create interference leakage
seen in Fig. 8. The interference level is typically quantiﬁed
in terms of the Carrier to Interference Ratio (CIR). Clearly,
the interference limits the attainable capacity. To improve the
capacity, the conventional approach is to increase the distance
between the positions using the same frequency. As a remedy,
Transmit Precoding (TPC) techniques relying on transmitter
side channel state information can be applied for mitigating
the interference. A potent scheme based on hybrid wide-spot
beams was designed for alleviating this source of interference
in [48]. The main philosophy of this scheme is that
the
space-borne payload generates several ﬁxed wide beams for
providing wide-range coverage, so as to increase the frequency
reuse distance. On this basis, the space-borne payload also
adopts some high-gain spot beams for enhancing the capacity
in tele-trafﬁc hot spots.

2) Inter-system Interference: An increasing number of LEO
satellites has been deployed over the last few years, but
the available radio spectrum remains limited. So LEO satel-
lites require high spectral efﬁciency to address the spectrum
scarcity problem. Furthermore, GEO SCSs have to coexist
within the same spectrum in order to achieve this objective.
Consequently, having high inter-system interference between
LEO and GEO SCSs is unavoidable. When LEO satellites [90]
approach the equator, they tend to inﬂict increased interference
upon GEO satellites operating within the same frequency
band, as shown in Fig. 9. According to current International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulations, it is mandating
to consider the spectrum sharing between GEO and LEO
SCSs. LEO SCSs shall not impose unacceptable interference
on GEO SCSs. In other words, GEO SCSs are regarded as
the Primary User (PU), while LEO SCSs are regarded as
the Secondary User (SU). Thus interference coordination is
imperative for mitigating the interference.

On the other hand, the next-generation networks will pro-

restrial systems, LEO SCSs, and GEO SCSs [91]. However,
the coexistence with LEO and GEO SCSs has to be carefully
planned. Adding terrestrial systems to the mix makes an
already complicated picture more complex.

is known [92]. Similar to GPS,

3) Spooﬁng Jamming: Spooﬁng jamming is a form of
electronic attack where the attacker tricks a receiver into
believing in the genuine nature of a malicious signal produced
by the attacker. For example, spooﬁng jamming often occurs
in the civilian Global Position System (GPS). It
is easy
for the adversary to release spoof GPS signals to provide
false information, because the format of the civilian GPS
signal
there is usually a
dedicated downlink pilot channel for broadcasting channel
status, user management information, call information, etc. as
exempliﬁed by Iridium [6]. Attackers can imitate the dedicated
pilot channel
to broadcast false information to legitimate
users, causing network paralysis. Fortunately, there are some
common methods to alleviate spooﬁng jamming, such as
energy detection, multiple antennas [93], and authentication.
However, energy detection and multiple antennas increase
the terminal complexity. Hence the most effective approach
is to apply authentication for LEO SCSs. The authors of
[94] proposed an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [95], [96]-
assisted authentication method to tackle spooﬁng jamming.

4) Energy-based Jamming: Energy-based jamming is also
a form of electronic attack that interferes with Radio Fre-
quency (RF) communications by generating noise in the same
frequency band and within the ﬁeld of view of the antenna
at the targeted receiver. For example, most of the on-orbit
satellites adopt the so-called bent-pipe1 transponder without

ampliﬁcation and a shift from uplink to downlink frequency, like a bent pipe.

digital signal processing, so it is easy to encounter signal
energy-based jamming attack. Attackers may easily perturb
the satellite’s operation by transmitting high-power jamming
signals [97]. There are many types of jamming signals and
classiﬁcation methods. Zou et al. [66] classiﬁed jamming
based on the grade of difﬁculty generating them and compared
the different types of jamming schemes in terms of their energy
efﬁciency, how disruptive their interference is their complexity,
and the prior knowledge.

Due to the long open wireless link between LEO satellites
and the Earth, the adversary may contaminate it by jamming
at different locations, which can be divided into the types
illustrated in Fig. 10.

Space-based Jamming: The space-based jamming is
mainly released by spacecraft. This type of jamming has a
large range over which it may disrupt the downlink transmis-
sion, but it has limited jamming time and power owing to
having limited time above the horizon.

Air-based Jamming: The adversary may generate air-based
electronic jamming from aircraft or airships. As the electronic-
jamming aircraft and airships have more ﬂexibility than their
space-based counterparts, they are suitable for releasing burst-
type jamming. Compared to space-based jamming, the power
of air-based jamming is typically higher. Because airships are
generally located between the ground users and LEO satellites,
they can interfere with the desired communication during both
uplink and downlink transmissions.

Ground-based Jamming: The power of ground-based jam-
ming is typically high and the jamming style is diverse,
because the ground-based jamming is maliciously released
by large-scale ﬁxed, vehicle-mounted, or ship-borne jamming
stations having abundant resources and power. Ground-based
jamming mainly affects the uplink transmissions. There are
many types of ground-based jamming, but the distance is not a
dominant factor. Ground-based jamming is usually of blocking
nature, which directly blocks the satellite transponder. These
three types of energy-based jamming techniques are compared
in Table III.

The family of SS modulations constitutes efﬁcient tech-
niques resisting jamming. Additionally, some non-SS anti-
jamming techniques including, temporal domain adaptive ﬁl-
tering [98] and transform domain adaptive ﬁltering [99], can

The particles existing in cosmic radiation generate a large
number of electrons and holes in the incident path by ion-
ization. Electronic devices like FPGAs collect these charges,
which may cause transient faults. If the charge exceeds the
maximum level that the device can withstand without SEU, the
logic state of the circuit will be inverted. However, the circuit
can be restored to its original working state by rewriting or
resetting. Hence SEUs constitute reversible soft errors [100].
The nature of SEUs is hardware-dependent. Compared
to FPGAs, Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
exhibit better resistance to SEU, but
they lack ﬂexibility.
Therefore, FPGAs are widely used in LEO satellites as a
beneﬁt of their high performance and ﬂexibility. In order to
ensure the reliable operation of FPGA in-orbit, it is necessary
to employ SEU mitigation measures, such as TMRs and
periodical refreshing.

E. Space Debris

In recent years, the launch activities have been increasing
for LEO, Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), GEO satellites. The
different orbital regions are unevenly populated. It is seen from
Fig. 11 that the LEO orbits between 800 and 1400 km con-
stitute the most crowded space fuelled by the miniaturization
of satellites and the deployment of mega-constellations.

However, frequent launch activities in LEOs greatly in-
creases the risk of collisions, which inevitably generate further
debris. As a matter of fact, in 2009, the Iridium 33 satellite
collided with the scrapped Russian Cosmos over Siberia,
producing at least thousands of debris [102]. These space
debris was ﬁxed only a few months later, distributed between
500 km and 1300 km. As a remedy, the collision avoidance
control has to be carried out for reducing the risk of collisions
with LEO satellites. On Sep. 2, 2019, European Space Agency
(ESA) made an emergency steering of the Aeolus satellite,
successfully avoiding a space ‘car accident’ with Starlink-44
[103]. As reported by United Nation Ofﬁce for Outer Space
Affairs, the China Space Station has successfully conducted
two evasive manoeuvres to avoid potential collisions with the
Starlink-1095 satellite on Jul. 1, 2021 and the Starlink-2305
satellite on Oct. 21, 2021, respectively [104].

Again, such frequent deployment activities have also led
to a surge in space debris. Most orbital debris is human-
generated objects, such as pieces of spacecraft, tiny ﬂecks of
paint from a spacecraft, parts of rockets, and decayed satellites.
According to the ESA, there are approximately 1036500 debris
objects larger than 1 cm estimated by statistical models to
be in orbit [105]. There are close to 6000 tons of materials
in LEO. Most ‘space debris’ moves fast, reaching speeds of
18000 miles per hour, almost seven times that of bullets.
They expose LEO satellites to the Kessler phenomenon2.

2The Kessler phenomenon, proposed by National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, is a chain reaction
in which the resulting space debris would destroy other satellites and so on,
with the result that LEO would become unusable [106].

11

Fig. 10: Sources of interference contaminating LEO SCSs.

ESA has showcased the solar cells retrieved from the Hubble
Space Telescope, which have been damaged by various col-
lisions with space debris. In 2007, orbital debris completely
penetrated one of the radiator panels of the shuttle Endeavour.
On August 23rd, 2015, ESA engineers have discovered that a
solar panel on the Sentinel-1A satellite was hit by a millimeter-
sized debris according to space-borne cameras. Fortunately,
this satellite still remained capable of operating normally.
Fig. 12(d) shows the location of a space debris strike on the
International Space Station’s Canadarm2 robot arm, which was
spotted on May 12th, 2021.

Because of these incidents, it is routine for operators of
satellites in dense orbits to spend time on tracking the collision
risk. When the probability of collision exceeds a certain limit,
debris avoidance maneuvers have to be planned. For example,
the International Space Station has carried out as many as 29
debris avoidance maneuvers since 1999 [111]. However, due
to its excessive fuel consumption, the technical solutions in
[111] are not suitable for low-cost LEO satellites with limited
energy. Indeed, active debris removal is the best method of
reducing the probability of collision, which will be described
in detail in Section III.

In Table IV, we summarize, classify, and compare the
security vulnerabilities encountered by LEO SCSs in terms
of their types, attack location, degree of damage, reversibility,
awareness, and collateral damage.

III. SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES

In this section, a series of security countermeasures are
presented as solutions for the aforementioned security vul-

Fig. 11: Launch of satellites in different orbits during Sep.
2010 and Sep. 2021 [101].

Speciﬁcally,
the density of space debris in LEO is high
enough to cause cascade collisions, which adversely affects
space exploration. With the advent of standardized production,
the satellite development cycle and constellation deployment
cycle have been substantially shortened, but there are also
satellite failures, potentially requiring replacements during the
deployment. Hence Kessler’s hypothesis is becoming a reality.
As a matter of fact, collisions with debris at LEO orbits have
already occurred [107]–[110], as shown in Fig. 12. Explicitly,

nerabilities. These countermeasures are mainly divided into
active and passive security countermeasures. By deﬁnition,
active security countermeasures are capable of avoiding, hin-
dering, and even suppressing eavesdropping and interference.
By contrast, passive security countermeasures must directly
face these security threats and reduce or even eliminate the
impact of eavesdropping and interference. Additionally, some
security countermeasures such as debris removal and SEU
mitigation measures aim for solving the problem of excessive
space debris and SEU, respectively. The relationships between
security vulnerabilities and countermeasures are demonstrated
in Fig. 13.

A. Active Security Countermeasures

Advanced security countermeasures proactively aim for
avoiding security vulnerabilities. Among them, advanced
security-oriented antennas strive for enhancing the perfor-
mance of legitimate users (desired signals), while mitigating
the deleterious effects of both eavesdropping and interference.
Interference cooperation is capable of preventatively tilting the
beam in LEO SCSs before the occurrence of CCI between
GEO and LEO SCSs. Additionally, space debris removal is
capable of cleaning up space debris, thereby reducing the
probability of collision. These active security countermeasures
will be further detailed below.

1) Advanced Security-Oriented Antennas: There are recent
studies on advanced security-oriented antennas for secure
transmissions, since they are capable of reinforcing the radia-
tion pattern in the direction of the desired receiver while sup-
pressing the pattern in most of the other directions. However,
an eavesdropper equipped with a sensitive receiver may still
be capable of intercepting the communication link via a side-
lobe. To tackle this problem, side-lobe randomization [112]
may be used for alleviating side-lobe information leakage. The
advanced security-oriented antennas employ BF and Artiﬁcial
Noise (AN) [113] in the downlink to transmit AN in the direc-
tion of eavesdroppers for actively suppressing eavesdropping
[114], [115].

However, as shown in Fig. 14, eavesdroppers may be able
to penetrate the main-lobe direction anywhere between the
satellite and the Earth. In this scenario, the aforementioned
secure techniques no longer work, as their beams are only
angle-dependent. The Frequency Diverse Array (FDA) [116]
can be employed to address this problem. The authors of [117]
introduced a Linear Frequency Diverse Array (LFDA) that
can generate a beam pattern depending on both the angle
and the distance by linearly shifting the carrier frequencies
across different antennas. However, the distance and direction
of the beam pattern generated are coupled, hence it may still
be possible for the eavesdropper to incept the message of

14

the legitimate user at certain positions. Recently, the Radom
Frequency Diverse Array (RFDA) concept was conceived
[118], whose array elements were randomly assigned different
frequencies for decoupling the correlation between direction
and distance. Nevertheless, there are several drawbacks of the
RFDA. Due to the randomness in the frequency of each array
element, the implementation complexity of the terminal is
increased. Although a FDA is capable of providing additional
security in the distance dimension, its beam pattern is time-
variant, which limits its ﬁeld of application [119].

Fig. 14: Eve is aligned with Bob in the main-lobe’s direction.

Relay cooperation constitutes a potential solution to the
above problems [120], [121]. Each relay could send its down-
link trafﬁc information in the desired direction and AN in
other directions to meddle with the eavesdropper’s signal
reception [122]. Additionally, relay cooperation also supports
secure non-line-of-sight transmissions. However, the topology
changes frequently due to the high mobility of LEO SCSs.
Hence both the location and power of each node should be
optimized for maximizing security performance.

Additionally, the NOMA-based TPC scheme is capable of
improving the security, regardless of the speciﬁc location of
E. Explicitly, recall from Fig. 6 that S can deliver both the
legitimate signal as well as the interference used for confusing
E, because similar to the concept of power-domain NOMA,
the speciﬁcally conditioned interference may be superimposed
on the legitimate signal. Successive interference cancellation
(SIC) may be invoked by D for ﬁrst detecting the higher-power
speciﬁcally conditioned interference designed for confusing E,
which then leaves the clean desired signal behind.

However, there is a trade-off between the power assigned to
the speciﬁcally conditioned interference designed for confus-
ing E and the secrecy capacity improvement attainted. The
maximum transmit power at S is written as P , while Ps
given by 0 < Ps < P indicates the transmit power of the
legitimate signal. Both the small-scale fading and the path
loss are incorporated into the ordered channel gain. Based on
the aforementioned assumptions, the instantaneous SNR of E
and D can be written as

Aggressive frequency reuse results in high probability of
CCI. The family of advanced security-oriented antennas [123]
strikes a trade-off between the maximization of the signal
power at the desired receiver and the minimization of the
interference leaked to non-intended receivers. For this reason,
sophisticated TPC techniques relying on advanced security-
oriented antennas are required for mitigating the interfer-
ence in order to facilitate adaptive coverage provision and
dynamic trafﬁc optimization [124]. The authors of [125]
focused their attention on massive Multiple Input Multiple
Output (MIMO) transmission for LEO SCSs by relying on
sophisticated Doppler and delay compensations at the terminal.

15

In this way, the maximization of both the Average Signal to
Leakage Plus Noise Ratio (ASLNR) and of the Average Signal
to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (ASINR) was achieved.

The authors of [126] conceived a NOMA-based multi-beam
LEO satellite-based IoT solution for mitigating the MAI of
traditional orthogonal multiple access schemes. A robust BF
design was formulated for minimizing the total transmit power
of both non-critical and critical IoT applications.

The advanced security-oriented antennas also allow the
beam pattern to be adjusted in response to time-variant jam-
ming conditions. Explicitly, the beam pattern can be adjusted
in azimuth to minimize the interference impinging from the
left or right of an antenna or in elevation [127]–[129]. How-
ever, angular-domain anti-jamming schemes fail to suppress
the jamming, when the legitimate user and the jamming are
aligned in the same direction. The combination of temporal
domain, transform domain, and spatial domain suppression
[130], [131] represents a low-complexity solution in the case
when the legitimate user and interference are aligned in the
same direction. If there is still some residual interference in
the signal after spatial domain jamming suppression, either
temporal domain or transform domain adaptive ﬁltering can
be employed for further reducing the interference. The salient
research advances in the ﬁeld of advanced security-oriented
antennas are summarized in Table V.

2) Interference Coordination: Interference coordination is
a promising technique of mitigating the inter-system interfer-
ence caused by the spectrum crunch in SAGINs. It typically
mitigates the interference by power control, beam drifting,
cognitive radio techniques, etc. while improving the spectral
efﬁciency and meeting the ever-increasing capacity demands.
The ITU speciﬁes that GEO SCSs have priority over LEO
SCSs with regard to frequency usage. Consequently, accurate
power control is required in LEO SCSs for satisfying the
interference constraints imposed by GEO SCSs. However, the
power control also directly affects the throughput of LEO
SCSs [132], [133]. As a remedy, the authors of [134] modeled
this power control problem as an optimization problem aiming
for maximizing the sum rate of the LEO SCSs. Then, the
popular fractional programming technique was employed for
transforming this nonconvex problem into a tractable form.
By contrast, the authors of [135] conceived a joint multi-
beam power control algorithm for optimizing the transmit
power of LEO and GEO satellite beams. On the premise
of ensuring the signal quality of GEO SCSs. This algorithm
judiciously reduced the transmission power of GEO beams,
thereby maximizing the throughput of LEO SCSs.

Some schemes rely on so-called beam drifting in LEO
SCSs, which force the LEO satellite users into the adjacent
beam even before interference actually occurs [48], [136]–
[138]. The authors of [136] conceived a sophisticated strat-
egy for reducing the downlink interference inﬂicted by LEO
satellites on GEO satellite users. The authors of [137] mit-
igated the interference between LEO and GEO satellites by
appropriately tilting the transmission direction of the phased
array based antennas of LEO satellites by solving a nonlinear
programming problem used for ﬁnding the optimal direction.
OneWeb adopted the method of [138] for LEO SCSs to avoid

the risk of interference with GEO SCSs operating at the same
frequency. Speciﬁcally, when an interference event occurs,
some of the beams are brieﬂy turned off as they cross the
equator. Subsequently, when the LEO SCSs exit the GEO
SCSs exclusion zone, the speciﬁc beams which were turned
off are turned back on again. In the context of a hybrid beam
based coverage scheme3, the authors of [48] also proposed a
so-called coverage-extension method for beam drifting, which
relies on expanding the wide beam to cover the serving areas
of adjacent satellites. When the coverage area of a LEO
satellite is overlapped by that of the adjacent satellites, one
of them can be turned off to avoid the potential interference.
Given the ever-increasing deployment density of LEO mega-
constellations, a spectrum crunch is imminent. Cognitive radio
[139]–[141] techniques are capable of mitigating this problem.
In cognitive radio networks, PUs have higher priority or legacy
rights on the usage of a speciﬁc spectrum. SUs, which have
a lower priority, should not cause interference to PUs. Hence
SUs must have cognitive radio capabilities for adapting their
communications channel access to the dynamic environments
in which they operate. Explicitly, cognitive radio devices
can sense, detect, and monitor the surrounding opportunities
including spectrum, time, geographical space, code, as well
as angle [142] and reconﬁgure the operating characteristics to
best match those opportunities.

3There is a wide beam providing coverage for the whole service area and
several spot beams for tracking users in each LEO satellite. The gain of a
spot beam is designed to be much higher than that of the wide beam, hence
the spot beam is provided for supporting data transmission, while the wide
beam is ﬁxed and it is suitable for control signals.

Cognitive radios are capable of making autonomous real-
time decisions for mitigating the spectrum scarcity problem in
SAGINs. The authors of [143] proposed a spectrum sensing
scheme for LEO SCSs capable of mitigating the inter-system
interference between GEO and LEO SCSs. Upon identifying
the speciﬁc power level utilized by the GEO SCSs after
differentiating the GEO signal from the interfering LEO signal
and noise, the authors of [144] conceived a cognitive radio
technique for improving the throughput of LEO SCSs, while
guaranteeing that the signal quality of GEO SCSs can be
satisﬁed. By applying sophisticated relaxation and approxima-
tion schemes, they signiﬁcantly reduced the complexity of the
related optimization problem. The authors of [145] proposed a
cognitive satellite-terrestrial network relying on a distributed
cooperative spectrum sensing technique by striking a trade-
off between the average throughput and the average energy
consumption under speciﬁc interference constraints.

Additionally, the authors of [146] conceived a two-stage
spectrum-sharing framework by combining the advantages of
cognitive radio and power control techniques. This framework
jointly optimizes the spectrum sensing time and the LEO SCSs
transmit power with the objective of enhancing the spectral
efﬁciency and seamless coexistence. The authors of [147]
proposed a joint beam hopping and power control scheme for
maximizing the throughput of LEO SCSs, while preserving the
signal quality of GEO SCSs. A deep learning aided spectrum
prediction method was proposed in [148] for mitigating the
inter-system interference. A sophisticated combination of a
convolutional neural network and of a carefully dimensioned
bespoke memory was harnessed for data mining from the

historical spectrum usage of the GEO SCSs. This technique
was used for predicting the future spectral occupancy. As
a further advance, a joint user pairing and power allocation
scheme was designed for NOMA-based GEO and LEO SCSs
in [51], where the sum rate was maximized. Furthermore, an
adaptive modulation and coding method was adopted in [149]
for interference mitigation. Speciﬁcally, this method adopted
the angle between LEO and GEO satellites for controlling the
speciﬁc choice of modulation and coding scheme, with the
objective of improving the spectral efﬁciency of LEO SCS,
while limiting the interference inﬂicted upon the GEO SCSs
to the maximum tolerable limit.

The main results on both interference coordination are

summarized in Table VI at glance.

3) Debris Removal:

In practice, the LEO orbits are the
most densely contaminated by space debris among all orbits,
therefore LEO satellites are at the greatest risk of being hit by
debris. As Wyler, the founder of OneWeb, said: “My epitaph
should say ‘Connect the World’ instead of ‘Making Orbital
Garbage’.” In order to exploit the space debris and effec-
tively exploit the LEO for future exploration, we must make
concerted, collaborative efforts to both prevent the generation
of future debris and eliminate existing space debris. Pushing
the failing or inoperative spacecraft into Earth’s atmosphere
and burning them down is an effective means of mitigating
the generation of space debris. Researchers in Japan are even
experimenting with wooden spacecraft to minimize the amount
of space debris [150]. At the time of writing, many institutes
are contributing to the clean-up of space debris.

Nets and Harpoons: The most famous initiative is that of
European research institutions employing dedicated spacecraft
to snare debris by ﬁring harpoons and nets at them [151].
These space ﬁshing nets are thousands of meters in diameter
and are made of extremely ﬁne wires that are woven together
and strong enough to withstand the impact of space debris.
The mesh is launched aboard a satellite to be deployed into
space, and then it travels along Earth’s orbit to sweep up space
debris as it passes. Due to the gravitation of the Earth, it ﬁnally
falls into the atmosphere and burns up. On September 16th,
2018, the RemoveDEBRIS satellite captured a nearby target
probe that the vehicle had released a few seconds earlier, which
veriﬁed the feasibility of this method [152].

Another alternative is to use space harpoons for ‘hunting’
satellites. Speciﬁcally, such hunting satellites employ a lidar-
based guidance system to locate space debris, and a pneumatic
device is designed to control
the harpoon while catching
moving targets. The hunting satellites could also carry tiny
sub-satellites that would push the debris into the atmosphere
to burn it up.

Laser ‘Scavenger’: A new way to deal with space debris
has been proposed by Australian scientists based on adopting
ﬁring lasers from the Earth to break up space debris [153].
There are two main ways of using lasers to clean up space
debris. For tiny debris, high-power laser light can be used to
melt and vaporize it. Larger pieces of debris can be hit at a
point, generating a backlash like a rocket jet. Thus, its course
changes accordingly, and then it will drop into the Earth’s
atmosphere and burn up.

Robotic Arm: Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency has
also developed a robotic ‘cleaner’ that can use a robotic arm to
ﬁrmly grasp large pieces of space debris, e.g., dead satellites,
and collect them for hurling into the atmosphere to burn them
up. The robot, which weighs about 140 kg, has a robotic
arm equipped with powerful magnets that can be used for
slowing down space debris orbiting the Earth. However, the
characteristics of most space debris are not precisely known
beforehand, which results in measurement errors concerning
the relative motion between the robotic arm and space debris.
This makes capturing space debris complicated [154].

Giant Balloons: It is generally possible for a satellite to ﬁre
up its engines at the end of its life and head towards the Earth
to burn up in the atmosphere, which would require extra fuel
and eventually increase the cost of launch. The new cheaper
solution is to carry a folding balloon from launch ﬁlled with
helium or other gases. Once the satellite exhausted its lifespan,
it could blow helium bubbles for increasing its drag through
the atmosphere [155]. It takes only a year for a 37-meter-
diameter balloon to drag a 1200 kg satellite out of its initial
830 km orbit and to crash it into the Earth’s atmosphere to
burn it up.

‘Suicide’ Satellite: The aforementioned methods of remov-
ing space debris,
like using nets, harpoons, robotic arms,
or lasers, are costly. Scientists in the UK developed a low-
cost device called Cubic Sail to clean up space debris [156].
CubeSail is a ‘suicide’ micro-satellite, weighing just 3 kg,
that can be launched into space. Once locked on to its target,
it would deploy its kite-like solar sail, attach itself to space
debris and slow its ﬂight. Eventually, they will perish.

Table VII compares the advantages and disadvantages of
these solutions
these debris removal
are currently in the design or experimental phase, and more
engineering efforts are required to put these ideas into practice.

techniques. However,

B. Passive Security Countermeasures

In contrast to advanced security countermeasures, passive
security countermeasures must ﬁrst directly face security
threats and then they are spurred into action to mitigate their
impact as much as possible. Passive security countermeasures
tend to rely on traditional mathematics-based encryption, SS
techniques, Terahertz (THz) and space-based laser communi-
cations, and SEU mitigation measures, which will be detailed
below.

1) Traditional Mathematics-based Encryption: At the time
of writing, the traditional encryption techniques relying on
excessive-complexity mathematical operations are widely used
in the ground facilities of SCSs for improving the security.
The ﬁve-layer transmission control protocol/Internet protocol
model of SCSs is comprised of the application layer, transport
layer, network layer, media access control layer, and physical-
layer [157]. The above-mentioned traditional mathematics-
based encryption techniques are mainly employed in the
upper four layers above the physical-layer for maintaining
conﬁdential and secure transmissions. Naturally, they have to
satisfy the demanding authentication, integrity, and freshness
speciﬁcations of the system to cope with spooﬁng jamming,

node compromise, and hijacking, as illustrated in Fig. 16. The
associated aspects are further detailed below.

Fig. 16: The relationship between security vulnerabilities and
requirements.

Authentication: Authentication refers to distinguishing le-
gitimate users from illegal users. Because of the shared wire-
less communication link, each user has to reveal its identity.
Authentication must be completed prior to communication,
hence it can protect the system against hijacking and spooﬁng
jamming [83], [92].

Maintaining Integrity: Integrity means that the information
remains accurate and reliable during the transmission process,
and has not been tampered with or modiﬁed by eavesdroppers
[66]. In other words, the information received must be the
same as the transmitted information. It is difﬁcult for the
adversary to accurately forge the original information. Hence
including integrity detection mechanisms is capable of allevi-
ating spooﬁng jamming [158].

Freshness Testing: A compromised node is capable of
successful authentication because it has the secret keys of a
legitimate node [92]. A compromised node running malicious
software has all the distinctive characteristics of a legitimate
node [66]. Freshness testing employs code patches for dis-
tinguishing compromised nodes from legitimate nodes [65].
Dynamic secret key generation based on freshness testing is

capable of preventing hijacking attacks [159].

2) SS Techniques: SS techniques have been routinely
adopted as one of the secure techniques in military commu-
nications for more than 70 years [160], where the transmitted
signal is spread to a much wide bandwidth than the informa-
tion bandwidth. The common SS techniques include DSSS,
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), and Multi-
Carrier Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (MC-DSSS). Unless
the eavesdropper steals the random Frequency Hopping (FH)
pattern or spreading code, it fails to detect the conﬁdential
information [161].

Again, DSSS has been widely used in satellite communi-
cations [162]. Whenever interference contaminates the desired
signal, the receiver correlator spreads the interference to the
entire bandwidth after despreading, because the interference
and the local pseudo-noise code are uncorrelated. By contrast,
the desired signal is despread back to its original narrower
bandwidth. The SNR of the baseband data increases after de-
spreading by a factor of the Processing Gain (PG). By contrast,
the PSD of interference remains low in the baseband. Hence,
the anti-interference ability also depends on the PG. However,
the payload rate is given by the ratio of the bandwidth and the
spreading factor, which explicitly indicates a throughput versus
interference level trade-off in LEO SCSs. More speciﬁcally,
when the interference is strong, the DSSS sequence length
should be increased to improve the anti-interference capability
controlled by its PG, hence leading to throughput reduction
and vice versa.

to DSSS,

Furthermore, FHSS constitutes another popular anti-
interference technique.
the FHSS
In contrast
transceiver continuously jumps from one sub-carrier frequency
to another during transmission according to the SS code.
Hence the FHSS signal bandwidth may be composed of
discontinuous frequency bands, and it is often combined with
cognitive radio techniques to avoid interference at locations
to severe interference, whilst relying on adaptive
subject
frequency hopping.

Some security vulnerabilities eliminated by traditional mathematics-based encryptionMaintaining integrityAuthenticationFreshness testingSpoofing jammingNode compromiseHijackingHopping across multiple frequencies within a single symbol
leads to the concept of Fast Frequency Hopping Spread
Spectrum (FFHSS). More explicitly, the dwell time of each
hop is shorter than the symbol duration and multiple frequency
hops are completed within a single symbol duration, leading
to strong anti-interference capability. FFHSS may rely on low-
complexity non-coherent dehopping and demodulation meth-
ods, but this results in a substantial loss of SNR [163], [164].
By contrast, the coherent reception of FFHSS exhibits better
performance [165], at a substantially increased complexity.

Compared to DSSS, the bandwidth of MC-DSSS systems
[166] is wider due to the use of multiple carriers, when
SS having the same length is adopted. More explicitly, the
bandwidth is expanded proportionately by the number of sub-
carriers. Additionally, this waveform could also be combined
with spectrum sensing for further improving the level of
security. The results of spectrum sensing may be beneﬁcially
combined with adaptive sub-carrier activation schemes, and
interference suppression arrangements in a ﬂexible manner,
as shown in Fig. 17. Hence there is a trade-off between
the security and the integrity. Explicitly, the transmitter is
capable of intelligently adjusting the center frequency as well
as the transmit power of its sub-carriers for mitigating the
interference, which improves the system’s integrity. However,
these sub-carriers remain more vulnerable to eavesdropping.
Conversely, these sub-carriers of the transmit waveform could
also be actively hidden in some of the existing interference
for improving the security, which however makes the system
more vulnerable to these interferences.

To further illustrate this trade-off, the dependence of the
Bit Error Rate (BER) on the speciﬁc fraction of the total
frequency band buried in the interference is plotted in Fig. 18.
As shown in Fig. 18, the BER degrades as the fraction of the
total frequency band concealed in the interference increases
from 10 % to 40 %.

3) Non-SS Interference Suppression Techniques: When the
interference power exceeds the maximum tolerance level of the
SS receiver, the SS system has to resort to employing dedicated
interference suppression algorithms, such as temporal domain
adaptive ﬁltering [98] and transform domain adaptive ﬁltering
[99].

Temporal domain adaptive ﬁltering algorithms are suitable
for narrowband interference suppression. The Least Mean
Square (LMS) [98], [167] algorithm is a popular design
option due to its low complexity. The basic idea behind LMS
algorithm is to mimic a causal Wiener ﬁlter by updating the
ﬁlter weights until the least mean square of the error signal
is approached. It
is a stochastic gradient descent method,
which means that the ﬁlter weights are only adapted based
on the error at the current symbol instant. For a standard
LMS algorithm, the convergence speed is determined by the
step size parameter (µ), which may be gradually reduced upon
approaching convergence to the minimum.

On one hand, the higher the value of µ, the faster the
weights converge. Hence we can promptly track and mitigate
the ﬂuctuating interference. On the other hand, the higher
µ,
the higher the variance of the weights will be, which
affects the performance of interference mitigation. Therefore,

20

the realization of the LMS algorithm requires a trade-off, as
illustrated in Fig. 19.

By contrast, transform domain adaptive ﬁltering is capable
of promptly tracking the ﬂuctuation of narrowband interfer-
ence without an iterative process [168]. Transform domain
adaptive ﬁltering processes the received signal in the frequency
domain. Brieﬂy, it identiﬁes the interference and carries out
the band-pass ﬁltering, before transforming the signal back to
the temporal domain.

4) THz and Space-based Laser Communications: The fre-
quency allocations of several commercial LEO satellite con-
stellations are shown in Fig. 20. Observe that many LEO
satellites operate in the decimeter wave and centimeter wave
bands, such as Iridium and Globalstar. As the time of writing,
the Millimeter Wave (mmWave) band is attracting research
attention as a beneﬁt of its rich spectral resources [169].
Many LEO satellite manufacturers such as Boeing, Starlink,
and OneWeb sought permission to launch satellites operating
in the 50.2-52.4 Gigahertz (GHz) bands [12], [15], [170].
However, these frequency resources are becoming congested.
A potential solution is to increase the operating frequency to
the THz or even optical bands. Thanks to the development of
device and communication technology, these emerging bands
are gradually entering commercialization [171], [172].

THz communications: The THz band has a vast amount
of available bandwidth, which has to be further explored. The
radio frequencies above 100 GHz are largely untapped for
speciﬁc applications by the ITU, hence they might become
available for SCSs. Fig. 21 shows the application scenarios
of THz communications in LEO SCSs, including THz-based
Inter-satellite Links (ISLs), THz-based smart wearable de-
vices, and THz-based secure short-distance transmissions.

Although the high path loss of the THz band only facili-
tates short-range RF communications, this has the beneﬁt of
limiting the eavesdropping opportunities in secure communica-
tions. Additionally, the energy of THz photons is low, hence
mitigating the biological effects. This suggests that sensors
operating in the THz band can be embedded in the human body
to transmit medical information to smart wearable terminals
[173], [174].

Satellites are subject to atmospheric interference that pre-
vents the use of microwave bands. The employments of THz
communications for ISLs [175], which operate above the
Earth’s atmosphere, could be an attractive alternative. Accord-
ing to [176], THz transmitters and receivers could be designed
for circumventing the disadvantages of the microwave bands.
Although the attenuation of the THz band is high, this may
potentially be compensated by large-scale antennas used for
BF on a space-borne payload. The beamwidth of the large-
scale antennas in the THz band is narrower than that of
common microwave ISLs, which enhances their ability to
resist eavesdropping.

A summary of the state of the art of successful wireless
data transmissions, in terms of data rate versus link distance, is
presented in Fig. 22. Observe that the longest communication
distance was 21 km at 140 GHz [177], which is insufﬁcient for
ISLs. Therefore, a large antenna array and high-power devices
operating in the THz band should be developed to overcome

the extremely high propagation loss and power limitations of
the space-borne transceivers in harsh operating environments.

Space-based laser communications:
The laser band is far above the electromagnetic spectrum,
thus it has a strong anti-interference capability. Laser com-
munications cannot be detected by spectrum analyzers or RF
meters, since the laser beam is highly directional, which makes
it a strong candidate for ISLs and cross-layer links [192].
Additionally, laser offers several advantages over microwave
communications in terms of size, weight, and power dissipa-
tion compared to the mmWave band under the same data rate
conditions [193], [194].

Many research institutions across the world have conducted
numerous experiments, which are summarized in Table VIII at
glance. Additionally, Starlink tested ‘space lasers’ between two

satellites, relaying hundreds of Gbytes of data in Sep. 2020. At
the time of writing, Starlink is engaged in rolling out further
laser cross-links amongst their satellites for minimizing the
number of ground facilities and for extending the coverage to
remote areas [195], [196].

Although space-based laser communications are not affected
by the atmosphere and weather, the high velocity and the
jitter of the space-borne payload [214] make the alignment
and focus of the beam a challenge. Furthermore, signiﬁcant
Doppler frequency shifts may be observed by the space-
borne laser terminals in the ‘reverse seam’, as illustrated in

of the space-borne payload in harsh space environments. The
formulation of SEU mitigation measures usually obeys the
process shown in Fig. 24. The time-invariant functions should
be implemented by ASICs, while the programs that have to
be upgraded or iterated should be implemented using FPGAs
because of their ﬂexibility.

For the program implemented in FPGA, usually TMR is
adopted for preventing the impact of SEU [216]. Brieﬂy, TMR
is a fault-masking scheme based on feeding the outputs of
three identical copies of the original program module to a
majority voter. If the output of the three modules is the same,
the system will be regarded to operate normally. If any faults
occur in one of the modules, the other modules can mask the
fault. Thus, TMR can efﬁciently prevent single faults from
propagating to the output.

However, there is a trade-off between resource consumption
and reliability. The resource consumption of TMR is three
times that of the original program module. Hence, designers
usually apply the TMR philosophy only to the key part of the
program, such as the control part.

The parts operating without TMR require the periodical
refreshing technique of [217] to correct errors by refreshing the
program without interrupting its execution as detailed in [218].
However, the block Random Access Memory (RAM) used
in FPGAs will be initialized during the periodical refreshing
operation, when its real-time state is lost. Hence the block
RAM should also adopt TMR for mitigating the impact of
SEU [219]. In a nutshell, the combination of partial TMR and
periodical refreshing should be adopted for ensuring reliable

ferent forms of redundancy for ensuring the reliable operation

and stable operation.

IV. FUTURE TRENDS

Given the rapid developments of quantum technology, Ar-
tiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), IRS, and blockchain, they have great
potential to cope with the security vulnerabilities of LEO
SCSs. This section will address the new opportunities in the
security of LEO SCSs and highlight potent research topics for
stimulating future research.

A. Secure Quantum Communications

The conceptually simplest encryption method relies on
generating a pseudo-random secret key and then taking the
modulo-two function of the key and the information to be
encrypted, which is termed as plain text. Naturally, the key
has to be as long as the data sequence to be transmitted, which
implies imposing an overhead of 100%.

Then the resultant so-called ciphertext may be transmitted
from the source to the destination over a public channel. Given
the knowledge of the secret key, the receiver can recover the
original plaintext using the secret key. Since the key must
remain conﬁdential for the communications of the two parties,
it must be shared between them over a secure channel.

The family of legacy cryptography schemes was conceived
under the assumption that
it would require an excessive
amount of time even upon using the most powerful computers
by the eavesdropper to infer the key. However, given the threat
of powerful quantum computers, it is no longer safe to rely
on the above-mentioned antiquated assumption.

quantum channel as well as on an insecure public channel
plus an authenticated public channel. The family of satellite-
based QKD systems was richly characterized in [220], along
with diverse satellite channels using detailed examples, hence
here we dispence with elaborating on them further. We note
however that a detailed list of future research ideas on QKD
was also provided. Before concluding our discussions of
QKD we note that in 2016 the so-called MICIUS experiment
demonstrated the feeasibility of QKD over a satellite link,
bridging a distance of 1200 km using free-space optical links
[221]. However, as the terminology suggests, QKD remains
a key-negotiation and distribution protocol used by classical
systems.

By contrast, quantum secure direct

communications
(QSDC) [222] is a fully-ﬂedged quantum communication
protocol, which has hence enjoyed a rapid evolution, as
documented in [223]–[230].

B. 3D Virtual Arrays

Due to the physical constraints on the weight, size, and
energy consumption of LEO SCSs, only a limited number
of space-borne antennas can be used on each satellite, which
limits the array gain and interference suppression capability.
For example, it is difﬁcult to suppress interference, when the
legitimate user and the interference are in the same direction.
A potential solution is to improve the performance through the
collaboration of multiple satellites. Given the proliferation of
LEO mega-constellations, these LEO satellites are capable of
forming a 3D virtual array.

Similarly simple principles may be used in Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) systems for the encryption/decryption
the negotiation of the secret key relies on a
process, but

To elaborate brieﬂy, 3D virtual arrays can be formed by
sharing antennas among all cooperating satellites in the orbits
for better interference mitigation and information transmission.

as delays pose a serious challenge in terms of carrying out the
aforementioned weighted combining at multiple satellites.

C. AI-based Security Measures

AI [231] will facilitate the ﬂexible intelligent interference
suppression [232]. The ability to learn is of pivotal importance,
since there are large discrepancies in satellite coverage quality
across the globe. Hence the prevalent trafﬁc ﬂow, service type,
and CIR in the coverage area have to be recorded, learned,
and analyzed. As a beneﬁt, the communications resources can
be adjusted in real time according to the predicted service
distribution within the satellite’s coverage area in real time.
Consequently, more resources are allocated in areas with heavy
trafﬁc and vice versa.

However, given the limited resources of space-borne pay-
loads, most of the AI algorithms tend to rely on the abundant
computing resources of the ground facility, which inevitably
the real-time performance of the system. Hence there is a
pressing need for the concept of low-complexity space-based
AI algorithms, which are capable of operating in the face of
uncertainty.

D. Space-based Blockchain

At the time of writing, both the satellites of LEO mega-
constellations and the terminals are centrally managed by
the ground facility, which poses a serious security chal-
lenge. Blockchain [233] has the beneﬁts of both decentralized
tamper-resistance and anonymity. Hence it has been proposed
for next-generation networks [234], [235]. The blockchain
philosophy relies on a decentralized database that is jointly
maintained by multiple parties and uses sophisticated encryp-
tion.

Fig. 24: A ﬂow chart of SEU mitigation measures.

Even when the legitimate user and the interference are in
the same direction within the coverage of a satellite, other
satellites in the virtual array can still perform interference
transmission nulls. By
suppression by creating 3D virtual
combining satellites in the array, there is a great potential to
achieve performance gains.

Again, the 3D virtual arrays are capable of substantially
improving the received SNR with the aid of the weighted
combining of the signals transmitted by a speciﬁc terminal
in the uplink, provided that the frequency and phase shifts as
well as delays amongst the satellites are accurately estimated

satellites, the time-variant frequency and phase shifts as well

ational awareness, which helps avoid space debris in LEO.
By using blockchain, Surdi et al. [236] investigated a self-
organized decentralized ground facilities and satellites with
the objective of avoiding deﬁciencies of the current satellite
and debris tracking systems.

On the other hand, user data can be stored, relayed, securely
registered, and updated in each LEO satellite node, which
substantially enhances the data security [237]. Thanks to the
associated distributed secure management, illegal nodes that
drop packets can be reliably detected. Additionally, the authors
of [238] revealed that sharing location information in the
blockchain can prevent spooﬁng jamming. However, the data
stored in the blockchain is public, thus illegal users may be
able to breach privacy through data mining. Therefore, how to
improve the privacy protectional ability of blockchain remains
an open issue.

E. IRS-Aided Secure Transmission

Again, there is a high path loss between the LEO satellites
and the ground terminals owing to the long transmission
distance. Additionally, when the elevation angle4 of the ground
terminal is low, tall buildings and other structures often block
the wireless signals. To circumvent this problem, IRSs con-
stitute promising range expansion techniques, which impose
carefully optimized phase shifts on their incident signal, as
detailed in [239]–[241].

To expound a little further, the authors of [242] conceived
a beneﬁcial scheme for improving the received SNR at the
ground terminals receiving at a low elevation angle by de-
ploying IRSs on another satellite having a higher elevation
angle wrt the ground terminal considered. Furthermore, the
joint optimization of the active transmit beamformer and
of the passive reﬂection-based beamforming was proposed
for maximizing the received SNR. As a further evolution,
by exploiting the predictable mobility of LEO satellites, the
authors of [243] developed a continuous time model and
optimized the conﬁguration of IRSs with respect to the time-
variant received SNR, Doppler frequency shifts, and delay.

However, numerous new opportunities are provided by
the IRSs in terms of safeguarding the security of wireless
communication systems [240]. Brieﬂy, the IRs and transmitter
cooperation based BFs are capable of enhancing the signal
at
the legitimate users and degrading the signal received
by the eavesdroppers [244]. Yu et al. [245] conceived an
AN-assisted beamforming scheme for sum-rate maximization,
while limiting the maximum information leakage.

However, there is a paucity of literature on the security of
LEO SCSs relying on IRSs. Hence, how to exploit the unique
advantages of IRSs for enhancing the security of LEO SCSs
and what beneﬁts they will provide for the LEO SCSs’ security
requires substantial further research in the face of their time-
variant received SNR, Doppler frequency shifts, and delay.

4The elevation angle represents the angle between the satellite and the

horizontal tangetial line touching the earth’ surface.

V. SUMMARY AND DESIGN GUIDELINES

In this section, we provide some general design guidelines
for secure LEO SCSs based on the associated trade-offs and
summarize the main points’ take-away messages.

A. Summary

LEO SCSs have attracted increasing attention as a beneﬁt
of their seamless global coverage with low latency. However,
there are many open issues in the course of exploiting the
full potential of LEO SCSs, including their security issues.
Due to inherent characteristics such as special location, high
mobility, and so on, LEO SCSs suffer several severe security
challenges. In this paper, We mainly discussed their security
vulnerabilities and corresponding security countermeasures.

We analyzed the security vulnerabilities of LEO SCSs
based on their inherent characteristics, which include passive
eavesdropping, active eavesdropping, interference contamina-
tion, SEU, and space debris. For mitigating these security
vulnerabilities, we then introduced and summarized some
corresponding security countermeasures, which can be divided
into active and passive security countermeasures. Finally, we
highlighted secure quantum communications, 3D virtual ar-
rays, AI-based security measures, space-based blockchain, and
IRS enabled secure transmission as security countermeasures
for employment in future LEO SCSs, which require substantial
future research.

B. Design Trade-Offs in Secure LEO SCSs

By identifying the speciﬁc cause of security vulnerabilities
in LEO SCSs, they can potentially be mitigated. Speciﬁcally,
recall from Fig. 6 that we highlighted the security versus
integrity trade-off encountered in LEO SCSs without using any
secrecy coding, since increasing the transmit power improves
the integrity but inevitably increases also the eavesdropping
probability. Increasing the frequency reuse factor for improv-
ing the capacity will also inevitably increase the probability of
CCI, thereby increasing the BER, ie. degrading the integrity.
A series of security countermeasures were presented, but
most of them are subject to design trade-offs, as intimated in

the stylized Fig. 25. Below we brieﬂy touch upon the most
inﬂuential design factors:

• It is of vital importance to determine the speciﬁc choice of
security countermeasures employed by the different sub-
systems of LEO SCSs according to the speciﬁc trade-
off between the security improvement attained and its
cost in terms of the overhead imposed. Explicitly, tradi-
tional mathematics-based encryption relying on excessive
computational complexity is not suitable for the power-
limited space-borne payloads, but it is routinely used at
the ground facilities for improving the security level;
• Advanced security-oriented antennas are capable of sub-
stantially mitigating the eavesdropping probability. How-
ever, the family of NOMA-based TPC techniques has to
strike a trade-off between the capacity and the security
level attained;

• Interference coordination techniques - including power
control, cognitive radio, and so on - are routinely adopted
for mitigating the CCI between terrestrial systems and
GEO SCSs. These techniques have to be jointly optimized
in conjunction with GEO SCSs or terrestrial systems;
• SS techniques exhibit natural anti-eavesdropping and
anti-jamming capabilities. Hence they constitute the pre-
ferred choice of waveforms for safeguarding the secu-

• Some countermeasures

rity of LEO SCSs. However, they reduce the effective
throughput by a factor commensurate with the spreading
factor. Additionally, there is also a trade-off between the
integrity and the security of MC-DSSS systems, as seen
in Fig. 18. A fraction of the sub-carriers may be hidden
in the interference, which improves the conﬁdentiality of
the transmitted signal, but potentially degrades the BER;
such as advanced security-
oriented antennas, as well as both transform and temporal
domain adaptive ﬁltering, can also be used for improved
jamming mitigation. Among them, the low complexity
LMS algorithm - which is a popular design option of
temporal domain adaptive ﬁltering technique - is emi-
nently suitable for space-borne payloads. However, the
selection of µ affects the trade-off between the security
and the latency as shown in Fig. 19;

• There is no doubt that TMR mitigates the impact of
SEU, but at the cost of a certain additional resource
consumption. Periodical refreshing is another protection
measure, which may be beneﬁcially combined with the
TMR technique for improving the FPGAs’ reliability.
