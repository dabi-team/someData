Abstract—This paper examines the determinants of the volatility of
futures prices and basis for three commodities: gold, oil and bitcoin –
often dubbed solid, liquid and digital gold – by using contract-by-contract
analysis which has been previously applied to crude oil futures volatility
investigations. By extracting the spot and futures daily prices as well as
the maturity, trading volume and open interest data for the three assets
from 18th December 2017 to 30th November 2021, we ﬁnd a positive and
signiﬁcant role for trading volume and a possible negative inﬂuence of
open interest, when signiﬁcant, in shaping the volatility in all three assets,
supporting earlier ﬁndings in the context of oil futures. Additionally,
we ﬁnd maturity has a relatively positive signiﬁcance for bitcoin and
oil futures price volatility. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that
maturity affects the basis of bitcoin and gold positively – conﬁrming the
general theory that the basis converges to zero as maturity nears for
bitcoin and gold – while oil is affected in both directions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent increase in speculative trading activity within commodity
futures, including Bitcoin futures, which is derived from the rise in
ﬁnancialisation of commodity markets, has affected the dynamics of
these markets. These changes include the impact that open interest has
in predicting commodity volatility [24] or returns [15], and changes
in the relation between futures prices across contract maturities [6].

Numerous studies have been undertaken on the determinants of
futures price volatility. The earliest research in this domain, Samuel-
son [26], demonstrated that futures prices become more volatile as
contract maturity nears. However, it has since been shown that the
trading activity of the futures contracts also affects the price volatility
of futures contracts. Therefore, an investigation of not only the effect
of maturity on futures commodities [2], [20], but also the role of
trading volume and open interest is warranted. The former has been
shown to positively affect futures volatility, while the latter provides
a negative inﬂuence [3], [14], [24].

Despite the great deal of discussion on the determinants of futures
volatility, little quantitative analysis has been carried out on the
volatility of Bitcoin futures. Furthermore, there are few papers which
attempt to explain basis using trading volume or open interest, in
addition to maturity. Cryptocurrency research has developed since
the genesis of Bitcoin [22], however no consensus has been reached
on its pricing efﬁciencies [28], [18], [9] and the possible similarities
with other assets [10].

as was previously applied to crude oil futures volatility analysis [24].
We then extend this methodology to examine the determinants of
basis for the same three asset classes. The choice of gold and crude
oil as assets to contrast with Bitcoin is due to similarities shared
between the assets. Gold is chosen as Bitcoin is often considered to be
an evolution of gold, especially as a store of value, being referred to
as “digital/new gold” [11]. Crude oil is chosen as Bitcoin is also often
referred to as a commodity [4]. Moreover, Bitcoin shares common
features with gold and crude oil, namely a well-deﬁned circulating
supply and a ﬁxed total supply [13].

We compare several models with all possible combinations of ob-
jective variables in explaining the dependent variables, volatility and
basis. By employing contract-by-contract analysis for the three assets
data from 18th December 2017 to date, we ﬁnd futures volatility to be
positively related to trading volume and negatively related to open
interest in all three assets, supporting earlier results in the context
of oil futures [24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate the positive and
relatively signiﬁcant role maturity plays for Bitcoin and oil futures
price volatility. Our analysis also sheds light on role played by
maturity in the determination of basis, affecting Bitcoin and gold
futures positively – supporting the general

not for oil.

II. PRELIMINARIES

This section presents an overview of the key concepts of bitcoin
futures, volatility and futures basis, relevant to this paper.

A. Bitcoin futures

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) offered the ﬁrst
bitcoin futures on 10th December 2017, followed by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME) on 18th December. Since the CBOE’s
decision to delist bitcoin futures on 14th March 2019, the CME has
been the largest bitcoin futures trading venue, with contract unit 5
bitcoin and tick size $5 per bitcoin, yielding $25 per contract [8].
On 3rd May 2021, the CME additionally started offering Micro
Bitcoin futures, which are 1/10 the size of a standard bitcoin [7],
and options on Bitcoin futures. Furthermore, ProShares began trading
of the ﬁrst Bitcoin ETF on 19th October 2021, taking another step
toward legitimising cryptoassets [5].

In light of these considerations, this study sets out to investigate the
determinants of the futures price volatility for three commodities:
Bitcoin, gold and oil. We use futures volatility as the objective
variable, while taking maturity, trading volume and open interest as
explanatory variables, with the intent of identifying the explanatory
variables with the most predictive power for contract-by-contract data,

Widely considered to be a notable milestone in the evolution of an
asset as an investment product, the launch of Bitcoin futures helped
elevate Bitcoin’s status to a station comparable to other ﬁnancial
assets [1]. The CME offers monthly contracts for cash settlement,
meaning that an investor takes cash instead of bitcoin physical
delivery upon settlement of the contract.

III. DATA AND METHODOLOGY

1) Time to maturity:
In terms of the major determinants of the
volatility of futures prices, the concept of maturity effect was ﬁrstly
demonstrated by Samuelson [26]. The hypothesis states that
the
volatility of futures prices should increase closer to the contract
maturity date, when the ﬁnal payment is due on a ﬁnancial instrument.
This is based on the assumption that the futures market is more
sensitive to the information regarding the underlying assets,
the
fundamentals.

2) Trading volume: Trading volume is the number of completed
trades in a speciﬁc security in a given time period. This is one of
the important indices for measuring the trading activity of futures
contracts.

3) Open interest: Open interest refers to the total number of out-
standing futures contracts that have not yet been settled. It grows from
zero when a contract is ﬁrst listed, theoretically slumping back to zero
upon contract maturity and typically peaking around the midpoint
of the contract’s lifetime [23]. A rise in open interest coupled with
a growth in price suggests an upward trend, while an increase or
decrease in price while open interest remains ﬂat or declines may
implies a possible trend reversal [21]. Fig. 1 charts the evolution of
bitcoin open interest for a subset of individual contracts, as well as
the cumulative open interest across all active contracts. We can see
that open interest approximately goes as a negative parabolic function
of time-to-maturity for each contract.

Fig. 1: The evolution of open interest over the life of Bitcoin
futures contracts and of the cumulative open interest across all active
contracts from 1st January 2020 - 30th November 2021.

We investigate the determinants of the futures price volatility of
Bitcoin, gold and oil. Using futures volatility as the objective vari-
able and maturity, trading volume and open interest as explanatory
variables, we can reduce this to ﬁnding the signiﬁcant explanatory
variables for contract-by-contract data, as was previously applied to
crude oil futures [24]. We then extend this methodology to evaluate
the determinants of spot-futures basis for the same three asset classes.
Based on the results, we aim to ﬁnd the features unique to Bitcoin
futures.

A. Methodology

As discussed in [24], we employ a contract-by-contract analysis,
which investigates individual contracts and decides the most mean-
ingful set of data for a contract of each futures commodity. One
empirical way to test this is to estimate the following regression:

dvi,c,t = β0 + β1mi,c,t + β2vi,c,t + β3oi,c,t + (cid:15)i,c,t

(1)

where dvi,c,t is either the futures volatility or basis on the day t
for contract c of asset i. The volatility is calculated as (ln(H) −
ln(L))2/4 ln 2, where H and L represent the high and low price
for the day respectively. The basis is calculated as the percentage
difference between the spot and the futures prices, namely (st −
ft)/ft ∗ 100). m denotes the maturity, which is a decreasing counter,
v is the trading volume, o represents open interest and (cid:15) is the residual
regression term. For scaling purposes, dv is multiplied by a factor of
10,000 and, only for gold and oil, v and o are measured in units of
10,000 contracts. The variables are not transformed into logarithms,
following Hebert [14] and Ripple [24].

We ﬁrst run Eq. (1) with recent crude oil futures price data (i.e.
i = oil) to investigate the effects the three explanatory variables
have on volatility, to back-test the Ripple’s work [24]. We then
extend the method to Bitcoin and gold to test whether there are
any difference in the determinants of futures volatility between asset
classes. Furthermore, we change the dependent variable, dv, to basis
to explore if there is a similar trend in the determinants of basis,
especially for Bitcoin.

C. Basis in the futures market

B. Data

In futures markets, basis refers to the difference between the spot
price of an asset and the corresponding futures price of that com-
modity. There have been a number of previous studies conducted on
the basis since 1980s [19], [17] and its relation to trading costs.

The basis is a critically important concept for portfolio managers, but
the behaviour of the gap is not easily explainable until it converges
to zero at the expiry of the nearest contract. The theoretical price of
a futures contract at time t is denoted as Ft = Ste(r+u−y)∗T , where
St is the spot price of underlying asset, r is the risk-free interest rate,
u is the storage cost per annum as a perecentage of the commodity
price, y denotes the convenience yield and T is the time to maturity
[16]. This suggests an important role for maturity – however, it is
known that the basis mean-reverts, especially when the market is
more liquid [25].

Using this gap, traders constantly search for basis trade opportunities,
which involves buying a commodity at spot (taking a long position)
and concurrently establishing a short position through derivatives.

The spot and futures contract series from 18th December 2017 to
30th November 2021 for Bitcoin, gold, crude oil were collected from
Bloomberg. We took daily data for spot price and futures series (price,
trading volume and open interest) for each asset at closing time,
resulting in 47 contracts, whose maturity dates are the last Friday of
each month. We employ the last two months of observations for each
of the 47 contracts in order to include observations that reﬂect the
focus of market activity [27], [14], [24].

Table I shows descriptive statistics of the data for the variables
used for Bitcoin, gold and oil spot and futures markets in the
investigation. Looking at the mean, we can see the oil achieves the
highest trading volume (0.38 million contracts) and open interest
(0.31 million contracts), followed by gold and Bitcoin. Furthermore,
key differences are observed in the standard deviation, skewness and
kurtosis of the three assets. The standard deviation for Bitcoin spot
and futures prices is larger than those of gold and oil, indicating its
volatile nature. While oil spot and futures prices exhibit negative skew

to the left. The distribution of open interest is also asymmetric, with
a slight left-skew for oil, while it is right-skewed for the other assets.
Regarding kurtosis, the spot price of oil is leptokurtic when compared
to the normal distribution1 (with heavier tails), while gold’s spot price
is platykurtic. In terms of open interest, gold series have heavier tails,
while oil series have lighter tails. Fig. 2 displays the basis between
January 2020 and November 2021 for the three commodities.

Fig. 2: Comparison of basis for Bitcoin, gold and oil

The standard deviations for Bitcoin, gold and oil basis are 1.075,
0.409, 0.386, respectively. The basis is nearly zero-revert, suggesting
the overall efﬁciency [12] for all assets, while it is relatively weak
for Bitcoin, as implied by the larger volatility in Bitcoin basis.

IV. RESULTS

We tested all possible combinations of maturity (m), trading volume
(v) and open interest (o) in explaining the dependent variables,
volatility and basis, to estimate Eq. (1). We chose the mvo model
for the volatility of all three assets, as it achieved the highest average
adjusted R2 ( ¯R2), consistent with the model investigated in [24]. In
explaining basis, we chose the mv model for Bitcoin and gold, while
the mvo model ﬁts well for oil. Table II contains a comparison of
the some of the models we tested. Table III shows the coefﬁcients for
the mvo model to explain the volatility of selected contracts (March,
June, September and December) for the three assets, however the
analysis was conducted on all 47 contracts.

A. Volatility

The mvo model was chosen to explain volatility upon examining
Table II. Aside from having the highest average ¯R2, m and v are

generally signiﬁcant for all three assets in this model. As for o,
while not signiﬁcant for more than 20% of the contracts for Bitcoin
and gold, it is relatively signiﬁcant (38.3% of contracts) for oil and
always has a negative coefﬁcient when signiﬁcant for all three assets -
indicating underlying structure. The importance of v is emphasised in
the mv model which always has v as the most signiﬁcant explanatory
variable. v is always positive, indicating that volatility increases with
the daily trades, as expected.

As o always has a negative effect on all 3 assets, it appears to offset
the positive inﬂuence of v on volatility, consistent with [24]. One
explanation for this is that higher o denotes that more contracts are
available to be traded - representing increased market depth, implying
greater liquidity. However, it is interesting to note that increased v
traditionally also implies greater liquidity, yet o and v have opposite
effects on volatility. This could be because o represents the number
of contracts that have not yet been exercised, implying the increase
in the market depth [24] and so have the effect of stabilising price.
Meanwhile, v represents completed trades whose effect on volatility
has already been priced in. Unlike [24], our results do not show that
o only offsets half of the positive effect of v on average.

m is positive for the majority of contracts across the 3 assets, negative
for at most 4.3% of contracts. We propose two possible explanations
for this, the ﬁrst being that there is less volume, v, far from maturity
which leads to higher volatility as the contract is being traded less.
Alternatively, we can use o as a measure of market participation and
note that o starts at 0 and grows slowly far from maturity, as seen in
Fig. 1, implying that the market is more prone to manipulation due
to low market participation, resulting in increased volatility.

B. Basis

Upon examining Table II, the mvo model was chosen to explain
basis for oil as it yields the highest average ¯R2 of 0.554 and aside
from v, all explanatory variables appear to be signiﬁcant. The mv
model also yields a high average ¯R2 of 0.502, with a more signiﬁcant
role played by v, suggesting that the model could be fruitful for
future research, however previous research [24] suggests that o is an
important explanatory variable for oil. The mv model was chosen for
Bitcoin and gold as it yields a similar ¯R2 to the mvo model, however
o is not signiﬁcant for more than 6 contracts for these assets and it
is favourable to use the minimum number of explanatory variables
required to describe the basis.

In contrast with volatility, when signiﬁcant, o has a generally positive
impact on basis, at a minimum of 66.7% of contracts for Bitcoin and
a maximum of 83.3% of contracts for gold. A possible explanation
for this is that a large o represents a large number of unsettled futures
contracts whose impact on the futures price has not yet been priced in.

***, **, * : statistically signiﬁcant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively. P-values are displayed in parentheses.

Meanwhile, such an effect does not exist in the spot market, allowing
a gap between the prices of the two markets to open as this manifests
as a lag between them.

v generally has a negative effect on basis at 100% and 75.0% of
signiﬁcant contracts for oil and gold respectively. This is unsurprising
as spot trading volume is expected to be correlated to futures trading
volume, so we expect the volatility of both markets to decrease with
increasing v, rendering it easier for the spot and futures prices to
track each other. However, v is only negative for 25% of signiﬁcant
contracts for Bitcoin, suggesting that there is less correlation between
spot and futures trading volume for the asset. This could be because
the market for Bitcoin is less mature than the other two markets,
despite recent development in the market for Bitcoin [1], and perhaps
because most market participants predominantly trade spot Bitcoin.

m is mostly positive when signiﬁcant for Bitcoin and is always
positive for gold in the mv model, indicating that far from maturity,
there is a larger discrepancy between spot and futures prices due to
low market participation in the futures contract. This is consistent
with the largely positive impact of o in the mvo model for these
assets, as o starts from 0 far from maturity, as previously noted.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we applied contract-by-contract analysis, as previously
employed in crude oil futures volatility investigations, for spot and
futures daily prices. We used maturity, trading volume and open
interest data to investigate the determinants of the volatility of futures
prices for three commodities: gold, oil and Bitcoin. This methodology
was then extended to investigate the determinants of basis. By using
data from 18th December 2017 to 30th November 2021, we found
that maturity affects volatility positively for Bitcoin and oil, indicating
that less market participation when far from maturity is one of the
main causes of the volatility for these two assets. We also certiﬁed
a positive and signiﬁcant role for trading volume in determining
the volatility for all three assets, indicating that volatility rises as
the number of daily trades increases, as expected. Furthermore,
we found a possible negative inﬂuence (when signiﬁcant) of open
interest in shaping the volatility in these three assets. Additionally, we
veriﬁed that maturity affects the basis of Bitcoin and gold positively
- conﬁrming the general theory that the basis converges to zero at
maturity, but not for oil.
