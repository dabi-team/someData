Blockchain empowers a decentralized economy by enabling distributed trust in a peer-to-peer network.
However, surprisingly, a widely accepted definition or measurement of decentralization is still lacking. We
explore a systematization of knowledge (SoK) on blockchain decentralization by comprehensively analyzing
existing studies in various aspects. First, we establish a taxonomy for analyzing blockchain decentralization
in the five facets of consensus, network, governance, wealth, and transaction. We find a lack of research
on the transaction aspects that closely characterize user behavior. Second, we apply Shannon entropy in
information theory to propose a decentralization index for blockchain transactions. We show that our index
intuitively measures levels of decentralization in peer-to-peer transactions by simulating blockchain token
transfers. Third, we apply our index to empirically analyze the dynamics of DeFi token transfers by three
methods of description, prediction, and causal inference. In the descriptive analysis, we observe that levels of
decentralization converge inter-temporally, regardless of the initial levels. A comparative study across DeFi
applications shows that exchange and lending are more decentralized than payment and derivatives across
DeFi applications. Second, in the predictive analysis, we also discover that a greater return of Ether, the native
coin of the Ethereum blockchain, predicts a greater transaction decentralization in stablecoin that include
Ether as collateral. Third, in an event study of causal inference, we find the change of Ethereum Transaction
Fee Mechanism to EIP-1559 significantly changes the decentralization level of DeFi transactions. Finally,
we identify future research directions: 1) to explore the interactions between different facets of blockchain
decentralization, 2) to design blockchain mechanisms that achieve sustainable decentralization, and 3) to
study the interplay of decentralization levels and economic factors. We also raise challenges in addressing the
controversies in blockchain decentralization.

1 INTRODUCTION
Blockchain empowers finance by enabling an economy of decentralization [Harvey et al., 2021].
Decentralization is a core property of blockchain that enables system security and the promise of a
distributed peer-to-peer network [Budish, 2022, Puthal et al., 2018, Weyl et al., 2022]. Blockchain
and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on blockchain promise to be non-custodial and openly
auditable [Gomber et al., 2017, Sch√§r, 2020, Werner et al., 2021]. However, the actual level of
decentralization varies greatly in blockchain applications [Campajola et al., 2022, Cong et al., 2022,
De Collibus et al., 2021, Gencer et al., 2018, Lin et al., 2021, Oliva et al., 2020]. Ao et al. [2022] even
identify a core-periphery structure in DeFi token transactions rather than a distributed network
that blockchain promises to provide. Moreover, a widely accepted definition or measurement of
decentralization is still lacking. In this paper, we explore a systematization of knowledge (SoK) [jsy,
[n. d.], sys, [n. d.]] on blockchain decentralization by answering the following three questions:

‚Ä¢ RQ1 (establish the taxonomy of blockchain decentralization). What are the facets of

blockchain decentralization and can we measure the levels of decentralization?

‚Ä¢ RQ2 (propose an explainable decentralization index). Can we propose a new index that
intuitively characterizes the decentralization level of blockchain transactions which is closely
connected to user behavior?

‚Ä¢ RQ3 (apply the decentralization index to empirical research). How does the decentral-
ization of DeFi token transfers distribute and change, and interact with economic factors?

We first review the literature that investigates various aspects of decentralization in terms of the
blockchain layer impact and the method of measurement. By means of the comprehensive review,
we aim to establish a taxonomy of blockchain decentralization. Then, we seek to further expand
the understanding of decentralization to on-chain transactions that characterize user behavior. Are
transactions made by a few users in large amounts, or are they distributed across many users in
small amounts? Transaction decentralization also describes the usage of a blockchain network or
application. Is the blockchain used by many parties, or is usage concentrated? Moreover, how can we
measure the actual level of usage decentralization? Entropy [Shannon, 1948] in information theory
quantifies the amount of information carried by events and is used to determine the unevenness
of a probability distribution.1 By adapting entropy to measure the degree of randomness in the
distribution of transactions, we propose a new decentralized index as the entropy of transactions.
We test the explainability of the index via comparative statics [Dixit, 1986], which compares the
simulated decentralization index of various transaction distributions. Third, we apply our newly
proposed index to study the dynamics of the decentralization of DeFi token transfers. By analyzing
data from the Ethereum blockchain by three methods of description, prediction, and causal inference,
we explore how the decentralization level evolves intertemporally, differs across applications, and
interacts with economic factors.

We have three major findings (F) that answer the RQs.

1Entropy has been adapted to various fields to measure the uncertainty of a random process in signal processing [Galar and
Kumar, 2017], data mining [McClean, 2003, Prieto-Guerrero and Espinosa-Paredes, 2019], image detection [Singh and Singh,
2008, Wu et al., 2013], market volatility in finance [Sheraz et al., 2015, Zhou et al., 2013], and the diversity or inequality in
an economic system [Haynes et al., 2021, Lim and Min, 2020, Mishra and Ayyub, 2019, Pourmohammadi et al., 2018, Teza
et al., 2021]. Entropy has also been used to examine consensus decentralization in blockchains [Gomber et al., 2017, Kwon
et al., 2019, Srinivasan, 2017].

(1) F1. We establish a comprehensive taxonomy for analyzing blockchain decentralization in
the five facets of consensus, network, governance, wealth, and transaction in terms of the
blockchain layer impacted. Both theoretical models of game theory and empirical measure-
ments, such as the Gini coefficient and Shannon entropy, have been applied to study the first
four facets of decentralization: consensus [Gochhayat et al., 2020], network [Gencer et al.,
2018], governance [Pelt et al., 2020], and wealth [Gupta and Gupta, 2018]. However, we find
a lack of research in the transaction aspects that closely characterize user behavior.

(2) F2. We propose a new index that intuitively characterizes the level of decentralization by
transforming Shannon entropy. Our index increases when the number of transactions in-
creases and when the distribution of transactions is more evenly distributed, intuitively
reflecting greater levels of decentralization.

(3) F3. By applying our proposed index to empirical research on top DeFi applications, we find
that the level of transaction decentralization varies greatly across different DeFi applica-
tions and within an application temporally in the descriptive analysis. First, decentralized
exchanges (DEXs) and lending applications appear slightly more decentralized overall than
payment and derivative applications. This is likely due to a greater demand for exchanging
and borrowing, leading to a greater number and more even distributions of transactions.
Intuitively, applications that become more popular and are utilized more tend to become more
decentralized over time, while applications that are utilized less become less decentralized
over time. Second, there appears to be a convergence in the level of intertemporal decentral-
ization overall. In the predictive analysis, we document interactions between the levels of
decentralization and economic factors. We discover that a greater return of ether, the native
coin of the Ethereum blockchain, predicts a greater decentralization level in stablecoins trans-
fers that includes ether as collateral. Lastly, we study how the change in economic mechanism
affects the level of decentralization. We discover a significant increase in decentralization in
response to Ethereum Improvement Protocol 1559 (EIP-1559), an essential modification to
the Ethereum blockchain‚Äôs transaction fee mechanism.

1.1 Related Literature
Our research contributes to three strands of the literature: research evaluating blockchain ecosys-
tems, especially the blockchain trilemma [Bakos et al., 2019, Gomber et al., 2017, Sch√§r, 2020, Werner
et al., 2021] and the measurement of blockchain decentralization [Abdulhakeem and Hu, 2021,
Cong et al., 2020, Gochhayat et al., 2020, Gupta and Gupta, 2018, Lin et al., 2021, Srinivasan, 2017,
Wu et al., 2019], blockchain-related SoK or surveys, and the market analysis of DeFi [Angeris et al.,
2021, Chen et al., 2020, Harvey et al., 2021, Lehar and Parlour, 2021] (see Figure 1).

1.1.1 The Blockchain Trilemma. Decentralization, along with scalability [Joshi et al., 2018, Li et al.,
2017] and security [Herrera-Joancomart√≠ and P√©rez-Sol√†, 2016, Zhou et al., 2020], are desirable
properties of a blockchain ecosystem. However, Vitalik Butterin [Hafid et al., 2020] first described
a blockchain trilemma where trade-offs among the three desirable properties are inevitable. The
impossible trinity is now widely known in the blockchain community [Conti et al., 2019, Hafid
et al., 2020, Team, 2019] and in crypto-economics [Auer et al., 2021, Halaburda et al., 2020, Schilling
et al., 2020]. Thus, when making blockchain design choices, it is critical to measure the level of
each desirable property and understand its effect on the ecosystem. We contribute to the literature
from the aspect of decentralization and analyze the specific SoK topics.

1.1.2 Blockchain-Related SoK and Surveys. The literature establishes SoK on various blockchain-
related topics. We categorize current blockchain SoK and survey literature into three main aspects:
security, efficiency, and applicability and summarized them in Table 1.

This figure summarizes the related literature in the realm of blockchain decentralization, market analysis, and the
blockchain ecosystem, and our contribution is shown in red.

Fig. 1. Related Literature

‚Ä¢ Security: Privacy [Almashaqbeh and Solomon, 2021, Bonneau et al., 2015] is a fundamental
component of blockchain technology manifested in aspects such as the confidentiality and
anonymity of payments. Consensus [Bonneau et al., 2015, Wang, 2021b] is a core mecha-
nism of blockchain that maintains the distributed ledger and the security of blockchains.
Accountability [Chatzigiannis et al., 2021] often describes the auditability of blockchain
networks and the preservation of privacy. Front-running [Eskandari et al., 2019] occurs when
certain market participants have privileged access to information and have become an issue
on blockchains due to their decentralized and transparent nature. There have been novel
cryptographic concepts proposed to mitigate such attacks [Baum et al., 2021]. Cryptogra-
phy [Raikwar et al., 2019] underpins the security of blockchain systems. Beyond attacks on
the blockchain itself, DeFi applications have also become the target of an increasing number
of attacks [Zhou et al., 2022]. Recently, approaches have surfaced to mitigate transaction
reordering attacks [Heimbach et al., 2022].

‚Ä¢ Efficiency: Governance [Kiayias and Lazos, 2022] of blockchains is critical to the realization
of decentralization and the efficient development of blockchain systems. Scalability [Mccorry
et al., 2021] is a major challenge in blockchain efficiency, forming a trilemma along with
security and decentralization. Sharding [Wang et al., 2019] divides blockchain transaction

processing into smaller node groups and has emerged as a potential method to overcome
scalability challenges. Communication [Zamyatin et al., 2021] across blockchains has become
an important component of efforts to scale and foster interaction between blockchains.
Wang [2021a] summarizes challenges and potential improvements to the interoperability of
blockchain systems.

‚Ä¢ Applicability: DeFi [Bartoletti et al., 2020, Werner et al., 2021, Xu et al., 2021] is one of the
fastest growing use cases of blockchain, fostering a revolution in financial technology. Layer-2
protocols [Gudgeon et al., 2020] are protocols built on top of blockchains that complete off-
chain transactions while using the blockchain only as recourse for disputes. Shi et al. [2021]
surveys auction mechanisms facilitated by blockchains and the application of auction models
in the blockchain incentive architecture. Abuidris et al. [2019] surveys blockchain-based
electronic voting systems and their security and privacy challenges. Gadekallu et al. [2022]
reviews the role of blockchain in the metaverse. Hassan et al. [2019] and Ruoti et al. [2019]
discuss other blockchain use cases and the future of blockchain systems.

Our paper fills the gap in blockchain decentralization among a vast pool of blockchain SoK and
surveys.

1.1.3 Market Analysis of DeFi. Arising from the special nature of crypto assets, a diverse pool of
literature describes cryptocurrency pricing and valuation along with mechanisms and patterns
in crypto market returns, as shown in Table 2 [Franz and Valentin, 2020, Griffin and Shams,
2020, Liu and Tsyvinski, 2021, Liu et al., 2019, Liu and Zhang, 2022, Makarov and Schoar, 2019].
Our paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of what factors influence crypto market
valuation and returns, especially in the realm of blockchain transactions and network effects. Liu
et al. [2019] propose a three-factor model of cryptocurrency pricing by investigating the effect
of the cryptocurrency market, size, and momentum factors on asset returns. Liu and Tsyvinski
[2021] further analyze the effect of cryptocurrency production, network, and computing factors on

crypto-asset returns and conclude that network factors (wallet user growth, active address growth,
transaction count growth, and payment count growth) are strongly associated with returns. Liu and
Zhang [2022] propose a new market-to-fundamental ratio based on classic monetary theory and the
unique UTXO-based blockchain accounting [Liu et al., 2022b], the price to utility (PU) ratio, and use
unsupervised and supervised machine learning models to predict the investment returns of bitcoin
using different market-to-fundamental ratios. Franz and Valentin [2020] examine covered interest
rate parity (CIP) between fiat and cryptocurrency markets using liquidity, volatility, and bid-ask
spreads and concluded that high-frequency trading improves crypto market efficiency, decreasing
CIP deviations. Makarov and Schoar [2019] investigate arbitrage opportunities across different
cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and countries by price deviations and decompose bitcoin returns into
common and idiosyncratic components. Griffin and Shams [2020] further discover that purchases
of Tether, a digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar, increase significantly following market
downturns and sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Our research contributes to the discussion on
cryptocurrency valuation and returns by further examining efficiency in transaction and network
factors, focusing on the effects of decentralization, a previously unrecognized component. We also
investigate the impacts of cryptocurrency returns on the decentralization of stablecoins.

Note: This table categorizes the current literature on blockchain decentralization by the facets of decentralization examined
and describes their measurement along with the assets studied.

We establish a taxonomy of blockchain decentralization after conducting an in-depth literature
review by categorizing the facets of decentralization on the corresponding layers of the blockchain
system.

2.1 The Taxonomy of Blockchain Decentralization
The current literature on blockchain decentralization examines the impacts of decentralization
on various blockchain layers. We propose a taxonomy of 5 facets: consensus, network, wealth,
governance, and transaction. Table 3 summarizes the previous blockchain decentralization literature
by taxonomy while table 4 summarizes the recent literature by taxonomy.

The decentralization of a blockchain is manifested within many dimensions due to the layered
nature of blockchains. Beyond the core cryptographic infrastructure, the architecture of a blockchain
consists of both the underpinning hardware and applications built on top of the blockchain itself. A
variety of blockchain architecture definitions are adopted in the literature to study different aspects

of the blockchain ecosystem. A common definition to analyze blockchain models and security
consists of data, network, consensus, incentive, contract, and application layers [Yuan and Wang,
2018, Zhang et al., 2019]. In the analysis of DeFi on blockchains, Werner et al. [2021] categorizes
the blockchain into the base layer and the contract layer, while Sch√§r [2020] proposes settlement,
asset, aggregation, protocol, application, and aggregation layers. In light of the existing blockchain
decentralization literature and to comprehensively analyze the decentralization of blockchain
systems, we further elaborate on the three layers of infrastructure, incentive, and application that
consolidate the layers used in the blockchain modeling and security literature. The infrastructure
layer consists of data, network, and consensus layers that include the collection of data into blocks,
the communication model (distributed networking, data forwarding, and verification), and the
consensus mechanism (e.g., PoW, DPoS). The incentive layer consists of economic rewards to the
blockchain system, including incentive mechanisms of the block creation process and token/asset
distribution. The application layer consists of contract and application layers that include smart
contracts, algorithms, and mechanisms used to facilitate high-level applications built on top of the
blockchain system and all blockchain use cases, such as DeFi.

We contribute to the literature by further incorporating the aspects of blockchain decentraliza-
tion into the layered architecture. Consensus and network decentralization are connected to the
infrastructure layer, wealth decentralization is connected to the incentive layer, and governance
and transaction decentralization is connected to the application layer.

2.1.1 Consensus Decentralization. Consensus [Bach et al., 2018, Cachin and Vukoliƒá, 2017, Smith,
2021, Zhang and Lee, 2019] is defined as a state where all the entities or nodes of a blockchain system
maintain the same distributed ledger. Consensus acts as the fundamental mechanism to maintain a
blockchain system and information stored within a blockchain [Du et al., 2017, Halaburda et al.,
2021, Saleh, 2020]. Eyal [2015] shows that the decentralization of consensus is crucial to the security
of a blockchain system. Cong et al. [2020] and Wu et al. [2019] define consensus decentralization
as the ‚Äúevenness‚Äù in the distribution of ‚Äúmining power‚Äù in proof of work (PoW) permissionless

SoK: Blockchain Decentralization

blockchains. Liu et al. [2022c] and Li and Palanisamy [2020] describe consensus decentralization as
the distribution in voting delegation power (the power to delegate creators of blocks) for delegated
proof of stake (DPoS) blockchains.

Consensus decentralization thus characterizes the decentralization in the participation of con-
sensus processes, such as mining in PoW protocols and staking or voting in proof of stake (PoS)
protocols. Cong et al. [2022], Gencer et al. [2018], Gochhayat et al. [2020], Kwon et al. [2019],
Li and Palanisamy [2020], Lin et al. [2021], Srinivasan [2017] and Wu et al. [2019] empirically
measure consensus decentralization using metrics such as the Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy,
and the Nakamoto coefficient. Arnosti and Weinberg [2022], Capponi et al. [2021], Chu and Wang
[2018], Cong et al. [2020], Eyal and Sirer [2018] and Gervais et al. [2014] theoretically examine the
decentralization of consensus protocols using methods such as game theory to model consensus
participation and equilibrium.
2.1.2 Network Decentralization. Gencer et al. [2018] describe network decentralization as the
fragmentation of control over the network, manifested in the security and fairness of a network
system. Network decentralization thus depicts decentralization in the underlying blockchain peer-
to-peer network infrastructure, such as how users communicate with the network and how nodes
communicate with each other. Gencer et al. [2018] examines network decentralization using prior
internet measurement techniques along with the geographical distribution of nodes. Lee et al.
[2021] also studies network decentralization through the geographical distribution of nodes.

2.1.3 Wealth Decentralization. Wealth decentralization is commonly defined as the evenness in
the distribution of wealth in the blockchain literature [Gupta and Gupta, 2018, Wu et al., 2019].
Wealth decentralization thus captures the decentralization of monetary assets in tokens and native
cryptocurrencies distributed across blockchain users. Gupta and Gupta [2018], Srinivasan [2017]
and Wu et al. [2019] analyze the wealth decentralization of native currencies on the Bitcoin and
Ethereum blockchains using metrics such as the Gini coefficient. [Cong et al., 2022] utilizes the
Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index (HHI) to describe the wealth decentralization of Ethereum.

2.1.4 Governance Decentralization. Governance [Pelt et al., 2020, Reijers et al., 2016] is often defined
as the processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether
over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms,
power or language. Blockchain governance [Gu et al., 2020, Lee et al., 2020, Markus, 2007, Pelt
et al., 2020] is often defined as the means of achieving the direction, control, and coordination of
stakeholders within the context of a given blockchain project to which they jointly contribute.
Governance decentralization is often defined as the extent to which control over the blockchain
is shared between platform owners and participants [Brummer, 2019, Chen et al., 2020, Faguet,
2014]. Ostrom [1990] describes a fully decentralized governance structure where platform users
collectively have full governance control and can represent their perspectives.

Governance decentralization thus specifies the decentralization of ownership and decision-
making power on blockchain platforms and how they are shared between owners and partici-
pants. Pelt et al. [2020] define a framework to examine blockchain governance and aspects of
governance decentralization. Chen et al. [2020] and Srinivasan [2017] quantitatively measure the
decentralization of governance using various proxies, while Gervais et al. [2014] and Gu et al. [2020]
qualitatively analyze the governance decentralization of blockchain and blockchain applications.

2.1.5 Transaction Decentralization. The measurement of transaction decentralization is largely
absent in the current blockchain literature. In traditional financial markets, trades are executed in
a single market clearing usually controlled by a centralized market maker. Malamud and Rostek
[2017] describe transactions as "decentralized" when all financial assets in a given market are traded

10

Luyao Zhang*, Xinshi Ma, and Yulin Liu*

in multiple coexisting and interconnected trading venues. Chu and Wang [2018], Cong et al. [2022]
characterize transaction decentralization as the proportion of transactions conducted by the top
nodes in value transacted. Similarly, we define transaction decentralization as the evenness in
the distribution of transactions across users of a blockchain. This definition further describes the
extent of distributed usage among different parties. Transaction decentralization thus describes
the decentralization of peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain, especially examining the
distribution of usage. Cong et al. [2022] further explore transaction decentralization of blockchain
networks using utilization and congestion metrics in combination with the network structure
analysis. De Collibus et al. [2021] examine the concentration of blockchain transaction networks as
growth occurs through super-linear preferential attachment, a phenomenon where new nodes of a
network have a higher probability of linking with more well-connected nodes, causing a few nodes
to become hubs quickly.

2.2 A Review of the Literature on Decentralization
The current blockchain decentralization literature largely studies three aspects of decentralization:
governance, consensus, and wealth. Although by design, blockchains do not restrict who can utilize
the blockchain and validate transactions, the consensus and governance of the blockchain, such
as voting power in validation and upgrades, might be far from decentralized [Wust and Gervais,
2018]. Although blockchain is, by nature, a system with many decentralized entities, the control
and usage of blockchain may not be distributed across many parties. In reality, most blockchain
projects have a ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù or community of developers that have disproportionate levels of
influence on decision-making and governing [Pelt et al., 2020]. Bakos et al. [2019] further argues
that blockchains are often subject to a few parties who operate the system. Chen et al. [2020]
assign platforms a ‚Äúdecentralization score‚Äù based on data collected from CoinCheckup.com and
find that market capitalization often has a U-shaped relationship with governance decentralization,
where the best market performance is associated with a middle level of decentralization. The
decentralization score is assigned according to the state of governance on CoinCheckup.com, with
1 denoting Centralized-Hierarchical, 2 denoting Centralized-Flat, 3 denoting Semi-Centralized, and
4 denoting Decentralized.

Gencer et al. [2018] and Wang et al. [2020] analyze decentralization in Ethereum and Bitcoin
in terms of mining power and bandwidth. Lin et al. [2021] and Srinivasan [2017] instead apply
the Nakamoto coefficient to measure the level of network and consensus decentralization. The
Nakamoto coefficient [Srinivasan, 2017] is defined as the number of entities in a given subsystem
required to reach 51% of the total capacity. Unlike the Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 to 1,
the Nakamoto coefficient defines a single threshold often considered the number of nodes needed
to compromise a blockchain system. Gochhayat et al. [2020], Kwon et al. [2019] and Wu et al.
[2019] further apply entropy to measure consensus security. Wu et al. [2019] discover that Bitcoin
is 12% more decentralized than Ethereum in terms of mining power and 9% more decentralized
in terms of wealth. Measuring centrality in Bitcoin and Ethereum networks based on consensus
(mining) power, Gochhayat et al. [2020] note that both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have a
few mining pools that govern the whole network and therefore tend to behave like centralized
systems. Xu et al. [2019] theoretically examines the decentralization of DPoS-based blockchains and
their vulnerabilities. Berman [2018] and Xu et al. [2019] discuss the prevalence of voting collusion
on DPoS-based blockchains that lead to centralization.

Srinivasan [2017] defines wealth decentralization as how evenly assets are distributed on the
native blockchain or application layer. Gochhayat et al. [2020], Gupta and Gupta [2018] and Lin et al.
[2021] apply the Gini coefficient [Gini, 1909] to quantify wealth and consensus decentralization

SoK: Blockchain Decentralization

levels. They discover that Bitcoin [Gupta and Gupta, 2018] and Ethereum [Lin et al., 2021] have
very high levels of wealth concentration.

Governance, consensus, and wealth are all important facets of blockchain decentralization.
However, those aspects can only indirectly evaluate blockchain‚Äôs role as a peer-to-peer electronic
payment system [Mohanta et al., 2018, Nguyen, 2016, Tasatanattakool and Techapanupreeda,
2018]. Our taxonomy identifies that a direct measurement of transaction decentralization is still
lacking. Next, our research applies entropy to quantify transaction decentralization, an aspect of
decentralization missing in the literature.

3 DECENTRALIZATION INDEX: DEFINITION, PROPERTIES, AND SIMULATIONS
To fill the gap in the literature on the decentralization of transactions, we propose a new index
based on Shannon entropy, which is often used to measure decentralization in areas such as
consensus decentralization. The index is adapted from Shannon entropy to measure the degree of
randomness in the distribution of transactions with, a higher value indicating more disorder in the
distribution and more decentralization and a lower value of entropy indicating less disorder and
more centralization. With a base 2 exponential transformation, index values range from 1 to ùëÅ ,
where ùëÅ is the total number of transactions.

3.1 Definition
We define our decentralization index ùêª (ùëâ ) as:

or equivalently

ùêª (ùëâ ) = 2‚àí (cid:205)ùëÅ

ùëñ=1 ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ )ùëôùëúùëî2 [ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ ) ]

ùëÅ
(cid:214)

ùêª (ùëâ ) =

ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ )‚àíùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ )

(1)

(2)

ùëñ=1
where ùë£ùëñ is the value of each transaction and ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ ) is the weight of each transaction with respect to
the total transaction value.

ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ ) =

ùë£ùëñ
(cid:205)ùëÅ
ùëñ=1 ùë£ùëñ

(3)

3.2 Properties and Lemmas
In this section, we explore the properties and lemmas of our decentralization index. They are
derived from the properties of Shannon entropy; see the Appendix A. For simplicity and clarity, we
use ùëùùëñ to denote ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ ) and denote ùêªùëõ (ùëù1, ..., ùëùùëõ) as ùêª (ùëâ ).

3.2.1 Properties.

(1) Property 1 Continuity: H should be continuous, such that arbitrarily small changes in the

index should be achievable through sufficiently small changes in transaction value.

(2) Property 2 Symmetry: ùêª should be unchanged if the outcomes ùë•ùëñ are reordered. That is,

ùêªùëõ (ùëù1, ùëù2, ..., ùëùùëõ) = ùêªùëõ (ùëùùëñ1, ùëùùëñ2, ..., ùëùùëñùëõ ) for any permutation ùëñ1, ..., ùëñùëõ ‚àà {1, ..., ùëõ}.

(3) Property 3 Maximal at Uniform Distribution: ùêªùëõ should be maximal if all the outcomes
ùëõ , ..., 1
ùëõ )

are equally likely. ùêªùëõ (ùëù1, ùëù2, ..., ùëùùëõ) ‚â§ ùêªùëõ ( 1

12

Luyao Zhang*, Xinshi Ma, and Yulin Liu*

(4) Property 4 Increasing with Number of Transactions: For equivalued transactions, the

index should increase with the number of transactions. ùêªùëõ (

(cid:124)

)

(5) Property 5 Multiplicity: The index of independent transactions is the product of the index

of each event. ùêª (ùëù1, ùëù2, ..., ùëùùëõ) = ùêª (ùëù1) √ó ùêª (ùëù2) √ó ... √ó ùêª (ùëùùëõ).

3.2.2 Lemmas. Thus, we have the following lemmas based on the stated properties and the prop-
erties of Shannon entropy (see the appendix for the properties of Shannon entropy):

(1) Lemma 1: The index is greater than or equal to 1 for any number of transactions, i.e., ùêª (ùëâ ) ‚â• 1.
(2) Lemma 2: For a single transaction, the index is equal to 1, i.e., ùêª (1) = 1.
(3) Lemma 3: The maximal value of the index is ùëÅ , where ùëÅ is the total number of transactions,

i.e., ùêª (ùëâ ) ‚â§ ùëÅ .

3.3 Simulations
To better elucidate how variation in the number and distribution of transactions affects the decen-
tralization index, we designed the following simulations. Assume there are ùëÅ total transactions:
1, 2, ..., ùëõ, ..., ùëÅ and each transaction has a value ùë£ùëõ = ùëíùëõùúÜ, where ùúÜ is a constant greater than or
equal to 0. Therefore, the weight of each transaction is:

ùëÉ (ùë£ùëõ) =

ùëíùëõùúÜ
ùëõ=1 ùëíùëõùúÜ

(cid:205)ùëÅ

As explained in Levin and Zhang [2020], the distribution function ùëù (ùë£ùëõ) is derived from a specific
instance of quantal response equilibrium (QRE), i.e., logit equilibrium (LQRE), which is commonly
used in behavioral economics to classify decision making [Anderson et al., 2002] and is adapted
from mixture-of-types models Stahl and Wilson [1995]. Notably, the function is also used in softmax
action selection in reinforcement learning [Gao and Pavel, 2018, Jang et al., 2017].

The comparative statics in Figure 2 compare the decentralization index of different numbers
or distributions of transactions, ceteris paribus. We observe two intuitive patterns. First, given ùúÜ,
as ùëÅ increases, the value of the index increases. This shows that, as the number of transactions
increases, the index increases, indicating greater decentralization. Second, given ùëÅ , as ùúÜ increases,
the value of the index decreases. Intuitively, when ùúÜ equals 0, the distribution is uniform, indicating
the greatest level of decentralization. When ùúÜ equals infinity, the weight of the ùëõth transaction is 1,
indicating total centralization.

4 DATA AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
Data and Code Availability. We made the data and code open-source, available on GitHub. 2

To show the explainability and applicability of our decentralization index, we conduct descriptive
data analysis, event studies, and econometric analysis on major DeFi applications. We also conduct
causal inference on EIP-1559 to better understand the impact of economic events on decentralization
and user behavior. We integrate economic theory with an explainable AI approach [Adadi and
Berrada, 2018] to ensure that our predictions are intuitive and explainable. Although DeFi has be-
come an important application of blockchain technology, the actual level of decentralization in DeFi
is largely unknown [Oliva et al., 2020]. Our decentralization index shows that the decentralization
of different DeFi applications varies significantly in practice.

The top graph shows how the decentralization index changes as ùëÅ increases from 0 to 10000 with ùúÜ fixed at 0, 5000, or
10000. The bottom graph shows how the decentralization index changes as ùúÜ increases from 0 to 10000 with ùëÅ fixed at
100, 10000, 50000, or 100000.

4.1 Data Description
We queried data from three sources: Google BigQuery, CoinMetrics, and the DeFi Pulse API. We
acquired all on-chain transaction data from the traces table in the Google BigQuery Ethereum
dataset (see Appendix B for metadata). We queried all token transactions from each token‚Äôs genesis

Note: This table summarizes key attributes of all the top DeFi tokens ranked (across all DeFi protocols) according to total value
locked and indicates whether they are included in our analysis. Token type refers to the conventional industry categorization of
tokens according to CoinGecko [CoinGecko, 2021]. Token category refers to the economic usage of tokens described by the
Palgrave Handbook of FinTech and Blockchain [Cong et al., 2022]. Units for Market Cap and TVL are in millions of US dollars.

to July 31, 2021 (the figures include data from genesis to July 21, 2022). We acquired the ranking
and category of DeFi applications ranked in terms of total value locked (TVL) from DeFi Pulse
and acquired the market capitalization from Coingecko on July 31, 2021. TVL is the total value of
assets stored within a DeFi protocol and is a common "size" measure of DeFi applications. Beyond
the many traditional financial metrics, TVL [Harvey et al., 2021, Werner et al., 2021] is often used
to measure the popularity and success of DeFi applications [Lehar and Parlour, 2021]. To explore
the level of decentralization for different DeFi applications and application categories ranked
by TVL, we acquired the top 5 decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending, and asset applications
along with the top 4 derivative and payment applications. Some applications have more than one
ERC-20 token used for different purposes. A plethora of DeFi projects with distinct functions
exists within the DeFi ecosystem. Lending, DEX, assets, payment, and derivatives is a common
categorization of protocols [Harvey et al., 2021, Lehar and Parlour, 2021, Werner et al., 2021].
In Table 5, we acquired and categorized the top DeFi tokens in each category. We applied our
decentralization to the top applications in each category. To better contrast the decentralization
of different DeFi applications, we further categorized the corresponding token type of each DeFi
application into governance, stablecoin, liquidity, dividend, yield farming, and yield aggregator
according to Coingecko [CoinGecko, 2021]. Werner et al. [2021] define governance tokens as tokens
developers create to allow token holders to influence governance decisions in a blockchain system,
usually representing voting power in a DeFi protocol. They also often have other features along with
governance: access to a network, receiving dividends, etc. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed
to have a stable price, typically by pegging its price to a commodity or currency or by regulating
its supply using algorithms. According to CoinMarketCap, liquidity tokens or liquidity provider
tokens (LPs) are tokens issued to liquidity providers on a DEX that run on an automated market

maker (AMM) protocol. A dividend token is a token that pays out a portion of platform revenue to
holders. According to CoinMarketCap, yield farming is staking or lending crypto assets to generate
returns in the form of additional cryptocurrency rewards [Vermaak, 2020]. Yield farming tokens
are dealt out by yield farming protocols to incentivize liquidity providers. Yield aggregators are
DeFi protocols that automatically help users allocate assets to maximize yield farming returns by
searching for the best opportunities and adjusting for factors such as gas prices. A yield aggregator
token acts as a claim for the deposit for a yield aggregator protocol.

We also categorize each token by its economic usage into general payment tokens, platform
tokens, product tokens, and cash-flow-based tokens according to the Palgrave Handbook of FinTech
and Blockchain [Cong and Xiao, 2021]. 3

4.2 Descriptive Analysis: Decentralization Index in DeFi
To compare the level of decentralization across different tokens and DeFi applications, we create
boxplots, histograms, and time-series diagrams. Each instance represents the decentralization index
value with a window period of 24 hours. The boxplots show the relative levels of decentralization
for different applications and application categories. The histograms elaborate on the distribution
of daily decentralization levels within categories. The time-series diagram shows the changes in
decentralization values over time, capturing trends and fluctuations due to market dynamics, and
aims to illustrate how decentralization is affected by real-world events.

Figure 3 shows that in general, DEX and lending applications have greater decentralization
than payment and derivative applications. This is, in part, due to the number of transactions. DEX
and lending applications have, by and large, more daily transactions because the market has a
higher demand for exchanging and borrowing than other motives. Figure 4 shows that the level of
decentralization of tokens within each category varies greatly: tokens with a higher TVL ranking
tend to be more decentralized. This again shows that tokens with greater market demand and
utilization tend to be more decentralized.

In Figure 5, we note that Uniswap and Sushiswap have different starting points than Balancer
and Bancor because the former two projects airdropped their native tokens to loads of early users.
Despite the very decentralized start, these projects tend to revert to being more centralized and
attain a similar level of decentralization over time. Notably, Campajola et al. [2022] document
a similar shift towards greater centralization of transactions measured by the average number
of addresses per entity, with a few entities participating in a large number of transactions. Ao
et al. [2022] also note an intertemporal trend of centralization using social network analysis on
the DeFi token of AAVE, where transactions have become more centralized over time despite an
initial decentralized structure. One potential explanation is that most of those who obtained the
airdropped tokens will eventually sell their tokens, and tokens will be accumulated by the whale
holders. That is, regardless of the initial allocation, the token distribution will converge to a similar
level. This phenomenon holds for lending applications as well (see Figure 6). Cong et al. [2022]
corroborates with our results, observing that there is a shift from peer-to-peer interactions to more
transactions by large players. The mechanism behind is interesting to explore further; we leave it
for future research.

4.3 Predictive Analysis: Market Movements

3As a medium of exchange, general payment tokens are substitutes for fiat money or other liquid instruments, such as
treasury bills. Platform tokens are local instruments for payments on platforms that provide certain services or functions.
Product tokens empower a holder to redeem a pre-determined quantity of product or service from the issuer or a service
provider. Cash-flow-based tokens give the holder rights to future cash flows from a business.

2017. The first version accepts only ether as collateral. On 18 November 2019, the multi-collateral
version of Dai was launched, and the original single-collateral version was renamed Sai. Sai was
slowly phased out after the launch of Dai, so the special transitory nature of this coin makes it
an ideal candidate to investigate the changes in levels of decentralization as user dynamics vary,

that is, how decentralization changes as users of Sai transition to Dai. Furthermore, stablecoins
are often used as a medium of exchange in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. As an
integral component of the DeFi ecosystem, stablecoins are actively involved in day-to-day trading.
We seek to quantitatively analyze the impact of cryptocurrency market dynamics on transaction
decentralization through the lens of Sai/Dai.

The impact of user dynamics on decentralization is clearly illustrated in the decline of Sai and
the rise of Dai. Figure 7 shows that the decentralization index of Sai has been decreasing since the
genesis of the Dai token, which is the upgraded version of Sai. Sai token holders could irreversibly
convert their Sai tokens to Dai tokens, which resulted in fewer Sai transactions and more Dai
transactions. Such a trend led to a lower decentralization index for Sai but a higher one for Dai.

Furthermore, we look at the impact of specific governance and market events on decentralization
(see Table 6 for event details). We note that events related to governance do not change the
decentralization index substantially as token holders are less sensitive to governance incentives
than to economic incentives, such as the reintroduction of stability fees. We make two important
observations about events.

‚Ä¢ The decentralization index is largely affected by crypto market movement. For example, in
March 2020, the cryptocurrency market underwent a large correction. Many token holders
flooded into exchanges to trade their tokens. This caused a spike in the decentralization

index of both Dai and Sai. This motivates our econometric analysis to quantify the impact of
market movement on decentralization.

‚Ä¢ As the market becomes more volatile, the abrupt price adjustment could trigger the liquidation
of collateralized positions in DeFi applications, such as Maker and Liquity. To prevent such
an occurrence, there are, in general, more transactions, such as lowering debt position and
topping up the margin, during periods of market turmoil.

On the one hand, the decentralization index increases due to the increasing number of transac-
tions. On the other hand, there are more activities from whale token holders, which lowers the
decentralization index. We perform an econometric analysis in the next section to test which effect
dominates.

4.3.2 Econometric Analysis. As noted in our event analysis, the market movement appears to have
a substantial effect on decentralization. The cryptocurrency market includes both native coins of
blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ether, and tokens that exist on blockchains, such as Dai. Bitcoin and
Ether are two of the assets with the highest market capitalization and are strong representatives
of the cryptocurrency market. Sai/Dai is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and mostly
accepts Ethereum-based assets as collateral, with Sai accepting only ether. Thus, we focus our
analysis on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Sai/Dai. To examine the relationship between cryptocurrency
market movement and our decentralization index, we conducted an econometric analysis on Ether
and Bitcoin returns and volatility in association with Sai/Dai stablecoin‚Äôs decentralization. The
dependent variable is our decentralization index value, and the independent variables are Ether and
Bitcoin returns for different time spans, the first principal component (PC) of all returns, and 30-day
volatility. All the variables in our analysis have a daily frequency (see data dictionary: Table 11 in
Appendix B).

To ensure the stationary of our time series predictor and response variables used for regression
analysis, we conducted an augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity at the 95% confidence
level [Dickey and Fuller, 1979]. The null hypothesis states that there is a unit root in our time-series
variable, and the alternative hypothesis states that there is no unit root, indicating stationarity [El-
liott et al., 1996]. All the variables used in our analysis are stationary at the ùõº = 5% level of
significance. We have also applied the Newy-West Estimator for standard errors given the high
autocorrelation in our dependent variable (see Figure 11 in Appendix C). Table 12 shows that our
decentralization index has high single-period autocorrelation.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) returns are highly correlated across all time periods, so we only
show the regression results of Ether in this section (see Figure 10 in Appendix C, see Appendix
D for additional statistical results). Given the colinearity of return variables ùúå > 0.5 of different
timespans and the first principal component (PC) of all return variables, we regressed each variable
on the decentralization index of Sai and Dai.

Column (1) of Table 8 shows the relationship between returns/volatility and transaction decen-
tralization of Sai. Column (2) of Table 8 shows the relationship between returns/volatility and
transaction decentralization of Dai. ETH returns have a strong positive relationship with the decen-
tralization of Sai, especially for longer periods. This result suggests that with higher returns, there
are higher levels of utilization and trading in Sai and more decentralized market participation. Cam-
pajola et al. [2022] also found that user behavior measured by the average number of addresses per
entity is closely related to market returns. Moreover, ETH 30-day volatility of returns has a strong
negative relationship with the decentralization of Sai. Intuitively, with higher volatility of return,
more whale token holders move their assets, decreasing the value of the decentralization index.
However, these significant results for Sai do not hold for Dai in the short term, likely due to the
nature of Dai, which accepts a wide range of assets as collateral, in contrast to Sai, which accepts

only Ether. Despite correlations between crypto assets and a diverse pool of assets, ETH returns do
not impact the decentralization of Dai to the same extent. Our econometric results confirm that the
level of decentralization is closely associated with market returns, especially in the mid to long

term. Higher returns are typically related to greater transaction decentralization. This suggests
greater market participation overall. The results further answer the question proposed in the Sai/Dai
event analysis section: what are the relative magnitudes of influence on the decentralization index
between the increase in transactions and the existence of whale holders in turbulent markets? The
impact of whale holders and large transactions outweighs the rise in the number of transactions.

Implications. Our study adapts Shannon entropy from information theory to propose a
4.3.3
decentralization index for token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Our index is explainable,
measurable, and informative in characterizing the dynamics of decentralization. Moreover, our index
differs from traditional market transaction measures, such as transaction volume and transaction
count. Figure 12 shows the correlation between transaction volume, transaction count, and our
index together with the Pearson test results. Although associated with transaction count and
volume, our index further characterizes the distribution of transactions not captured by volume or
number of transactions. Furthermore, our index captures variations in transaction decentralization
associated with market dynamics. We observe that transaction decentralization is greatly affected
by market returns and volatility but not by nonmarket forces such as governance events. Our index
thus brings new insights to the study of token economics on blockchains.

4.4 Causal Inference: EIP-1559
EIP-1559 is a major overhaul of the transaction fee mechanism (TFM) for the Ethereum blockchain [Bu-
terin et al., 2019]. EIP-1559 makes Ethereum the first major blockchain to move away from the
classic first-price auction mechanism in coordinating the demand and supply of transactions. On
August 5th, 2021, Ethereum activated the London Hard-fork, bringing major changes to the TFM
by adding a base fee parameter and how users specify the bids for transaction fees. 4 Users can now
bid the maximum priority charge per gas and the maximum fee per gas in their transactions. Users
tip miners to prioritize their transactions using priority fees per gas unit. The maximum fee per gas
parameter acts as a cap on both the base and priority fees. Liu et al. [2022a] evidence the positive
impacts of EIP-1559 on user experience by simplifying the fee estimation process, reducing the
difference in gas price paid between blocks, and decreasing waiting times. These changes smoothen
the transaction process, making peer-to-peer transactions easier and swifter. In this section, we
seek the causal impacts of EIP-1559 on transaction decentralization. Our study further connects
economic factors to transaction decentralization in cases of mechanism changes.

4.4.1 Methodology. One of the most difficult challenges in determining the causal effect of EIP-1559
on blockchain decentralization is distinguishing the effect of EIP-1559 from confounding factors
such as price, volatility, market movement, and time trend. We adopt Regression Discontinuity
Design (RDD) [Athey and Imbens, 2017, Imbens and Lemieux, 2008, Lee and Lemieux, 2010]
to analyse the effects of EIP-1559 on transaction decentralization. RDD is a quasi-experimental
evaluation frequently used in economics, political science, epidemiology, and related fields. We
use the London Hardfork, the days from the EIP-1559 London Hardfork, and their interaction as
the independent variables in the RDD framework to estimate the immediate effects of the London
Hardfork and the average treatment effects of EIP-1559 adoption. Liu et al. [2022a] adopted a similar
framework to analyze the impact of EIP-1559 on various transaction-related economic factors,
including waiting times and gas prices, while [Cong et al., 2022] also uses RDD to analyze the
impact of EIP-1559 on mining reward distribution and transaction volume.

4The base fee adjusts dynamically to reflect the minimum gas price users must pay in each block, responding to the block
gas used in the previous block.

the London Hardfork on August 5, 2021.

4.4.2 Results and Discussion. EIP-1559 has a significant positive impact on decentralization, in-
creasing both immediately after the London Hardfork and gradually as a trend in the days after
the London Hardfork for stablecoins Dai and USDt. However, EIP-1559 has a significant negative
impact on decentralization both immediately and as a trend for lending applications Compound
and Aave. Nonetheless, this shows transaction decentralization‚Äôs strong sensitivity to changes in
economic incentive mechanisms and confirms our conclusion on market movements‚Äô strong effect

with ùõº = 0.1 of our decentralization index an alternate dependent variable, yielding consistent
results (Table 12 Appendix D). We analyzed 4 assets, including 2 stablecoins: Dai and USDt, and 2
lending protocols: Aave and Comp (see Appendix D). The stablecoins produced consistent results
showing EIP-1559‚Äôs positive impact on decentralization while the lending protocols produced
consistent results showing EIP-1559‚Äôs negative impact on decentralization.

Figure 8 shows an immediate and gradual increase in decentralization after the London Hard-
fork as discussed in the regression results. Notably, this temporary alteration in decentralization
caused by EIP-1559 does not reverse the trend of overall convergence towards centralization
intertemporally.

5 DISCUSSION
Blockchain creates a system of decentralized trust that relies on economic incentives to secure
the system by ensuring the benefits of dishonesty are outweighed by the costs [Budish, 2018].
Decentralization plays a key role in balancing the economic incentives that secure a blockchain
from majority attacks. Weyl et al. [2022] envisions a decentralized society where commitments,
credentials, and affiliations are encoded through non-transferable ‚Äúsoul-bound‚Äù tokens (SBTs)
maintained on blockchain that creates a trusted network of the real economy. Decentralization lies
at the core of what blockchain promises.

We make three major contributions to blockchain decentralization. First, our study systematically
reviews various aspects of blockchain decentralization and constructs a taxonomy. We categorize
current studies by aspects of decentralization measured and summarize the methods of measure-
ment. This approach lays a foundation for future research and facilitates the design of blockchain
mechanisms that enable decentralization. For example, it is unclear how the different dimensions
of decentralization impact each other in a blockchain system. The mechanics and incentives that
motivate decentralized usage are largely unknown.

Second, we contribute to the literature gap by proposing a new index that intuitively characterizes
transaction decentralization. Transaction decentralization is an essential aspect of blockchain
decentralization. On the one hand, the decentralized transaction intuitively characterizes the usage
of blockchain systems in the spirit of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks with financial inclusions. On the
other hand, a blockchain with centralized transactions is highly manipulable by a small number
of prominent players who effectively control the market force and heavily influence prices. For
instance, the Ampleforth stablecoin adjusts supplies, responding to price deviations from the target
price [Zhang and Liu, 2021]. Thus, transaction decentralization is also critical to the security of the
blockchain ecosystem that hosts smart contracts. Through empirical data analysis, we establish
that our decentralization index is a new technical indicator of market dynamics that incorporates
information beyond traditional measures, such as transaction volume. Additionally, we show that
our decentralization index is associated with economic factors. We pave the way for further analysis
on the interactions of decentralization and economic factors.

Last, our study contributes to the design of blockchain mechanisms. Although blockchains are
decentralized P2P systems by design, the realized level of decentralization varies substantially
in reality. We observe that the level of decentralization might converge despite the difference in
initial allocations of assets and technique designs. The convergence, unexplained by the literature,
might be driven by economic incentives and market forces. Our results thus also shed light on
a new direction of blockchain mechanism design that investigates both the origin and the long-
term equilibrium of the level of decentralization. For instance, Figure 9 represents the time series
of the decentralization index comparing the fiat-backed stablecoin USDt and the crypto-backed
stablecoin Sai and dai. USDt is much more centralized for consensus. But ironically, USDt is much
more decentralized at the transaction layer. What causes the discrepancy in decentralization levels
between consensus and transaction? We leave the question for future research.

A PROPERTIES OF SHANNON ENTROPY
Shannon entropy is defined as:

ùëÅ
‚àëÔ∏Å

ùêª (ùëã ) = ‚àí

ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ )ùëôùëúùëî2 [ùëÉ (ùë£ùëñ )]

ùëñ=1
We denote ùëùùëñ = ùëÉùëü (ùëã = ùë•ùëñ ) and ùêªùëö (ùëù1, ..., ùëùùëö) = ùêª (ùëã ). There are m independent events.

(1) ùêª (ùëù) is monotonically decreasing in ùëù: an increase in the probability of an event decreases

the information from an observed event, and vice versa.

(2) ùêª (ùëù) is monotonically decreasing in p: an increase in the probability of an event decreases

the information from an observed event, and vice versa.

(3) ùêª (ùëù) ‚â• 0 : information is a non-negative quantity.
(4) ùêª (1) = 0 : events that always occur do not communicate information.
(5) ùêª (ùëù1, ùëù2) = ùêª (ùëù1) + ùêª (ùëù2) : the information learned from independent events is the sum of

the information learned from each event.

(6) The Shannon entropyùêª (ùëã ) is a continuous function of ùëùùëñ . If all ùëùùëñ are equal, ùëùùëñ = 1

ùëö , then H

is maximal.

Shannon Entropy also follows the following rules:
(1) Gibbs inequality: ùêª (ùëã ) ‚â§ ùëôùëúùëî(ùëö), with equality if and only if ùëùùëñ = 1
(2) ùêª is monotonically increasing with ùëö:

ùëö , ùëñ = 1, 2, ..., ùëö

ùêªùëö (ùëù1, ùëù2, ..., ùëùùëö) ‚â§ ùêªùëö ( 1

ùëö+1 )

(a) Sai

(b) Dai

This figure visualizes the partial autocorrelation of our dependent variable: the decentralization index value for Sai
and Dai. The points in this figure show the magnitude of partial autocorrelation for 0 to 50 days, and the shaded area
indicates the 95% confidence interval. The autocorrelation of Sai for lag period 1 has a magnitude of 0.6815, a standard
deviation of 0.039, and a p-value < 0.000. The autocorrelation of Dai for lag period 1 has a magnitude of 0.4897, a
standard deviation of 0.042, and a p-value < 0.000.

Fig. 11. Partial Autocorrelation of the Decentralization Index for Sai and Dai

The figure shows the correlation between our decentralization index and transaction variables and the Pearson test
results. TxTfrValAdjUSD is the adjusted transaction volume in USD, TxTfrCnt is the transaction count and val is the
value of our decentralization index. The null hypothesis for the Pearson test is correlation ùúå = 0, and the alternate
hypothesis is correlation ùúå ‚â† 0. There are 589 observations (number of days) for Dai and 667 observations for Sai. The
correlation between the decentralization index and transaction volume is -0.07 (p value 0.087) for Dai and 0.84 (p-value
0.843) for Sai. The correlation between the decentralization index and transaction count is 0.32 (p value <0.001) for Dai
and 0.79 (p value 0.792) for Sai. BF-10 is the Bayesian factor for the alternate hypothesis. Power is the achieved power
of the test with an alpha of 0.05.
