Abstract Signiﬁcant attention in the ﬁnancial industry has paved the way for
blockchain technology to spread across other industries, resulting in a plethora
of literature on the subject. This study approaches the subject through bib-
liometrics and network analysis of 6790 records extracted from the Web of
Science from 2014-2020 based on blockchain. This study asserts (i) the impact
of open access publication on the growth and visibility of literature, (ii) the
collaboration patterns and impact of team size on collaboration, (iii) the rank-
ing of countries based on their national and international collaboration, and
(iv) the major themes in the literature through thematic analysis. Based on
the signiﬁcant momentum gained by the blockchain, the trend of open access
publications has increased 1.5 times than no open access in 2020. This analysis
articulates the numerous potentials of blockchain literature and its adoption
by various countries and their authors. China and the USA are the top leaders
in the ﬁeld and applied blockchain more with smart contracts, supply chain,
and internet of things. Also, results show that blockchain has attracted the
attention of less than 1% of authors who have contributed to multiple works
on the blockchain and authors also preferred to work in teams smaller in size.

1 Introduction

K.Sharma et al.

Blockchain (Kube, 2018) deployment since its initial perception was largely
experimental. Various authors have strongly introduced the promising non-
ﬁnance applications which have raised the special attention towards blockchain
across the globe (White, 2017). Blockchain has been seen as a disruptive com-
bustion engine with the potential to transform organizations in the current
digital economy (Prybila, Schulte, Hochreiner, and Weber, 2020) with fea-
tures like validation of transactions, safeguarding of entries (Ølnes, Ubacht,
and Janssen, 2017), preservation of records, immutability, decentralization,
consensus, and faster settlement. The idea of Satoshi Nakamoto (as an indi-
vidual or a group) to send online payments directly from one party to an-
other (Nakamoto, 2008), without any interference from ﬁnancial institutions,
started the hype of blockchain in 2008. His solution described the ﬁrst realiza-
tion of the concept as a Bitcoin (B¨ohme, Christin, Edelman, and Moore, 2015),
which was intrinsically tied with blockchain technology (Crosby, Pattanayak,
Verma, Kalyanaraman et al., 2016).

Since then the authors have demonstrated great interest in the blockchain
literature based on features, principles, applications, adoption challenges, and
opportunities to inﬂuence the potential of blockchain technology (Yli-Huumo,
Ko, Choi, Park, and Smolander, 2016). Various literature hoping for new indus-
try driven solutions and promising signiﬁcant business beneﬁts (L´opez-Robles,
Otegi-Olaso, Gamboa-Rosales, Rosales, and Cobo, 2018) from blockchain tech-
nology have also emerged. Such literature have also highlighted innovations,
emerging trends and corporate conﬁdence integrated into the adoption of
blockchain technology (Hoﬀman, Ib´a˜nez, and Simperl, 2019). Diﬀerent authors
have also analyzed blockchain as a consortium producing a greater momentum
and speciﬁc problem solver for emerging economies in various countries (Zeng,
Ni, Yuan, and Wang, 2018; Firdaus, Ab Razak, Feizollah, Hashem, Hazim,
and Anuar, 2019).

Despite various literature available on blockchain (Dabbagh, Sookhak, and
Safa, 2019; Yalcin and Daim, 2021; Guo, Huang, Guo, Guo, Li, Liu, Ezzeddine,
and Nkeli, 2021; Tandon, Kaur, M¨antym¨aki, and Dhir, 2021), this study ﬁgured
out the gaps in the existing study and presented the bibliometric and network
analysis of literature to show the trends in open access publications and the-
matic analysis (Velez-Estevez, Garc´ıa-S´anchez, Moral-Mu˜noz, and Cobo, 2020)
of technology across countries. The impact of collaboration strength (Sharma
and Khurana, 2021) and team size is analyzed from the author’s collaboration
network. Further, the share of national and international collaborations (Lee
and Bozeman, 2005) is analyzed from country collaboration networks and a
country ranking is being built based on the national and international collab-
oration. The objectives of our study are outlined as:
1. Bibliometric analysis of the publications to present a comprehensive overview

of the blockchain literature from 2014-2020.

2. To investigate the impact of open access publication on the growth and

visibility of blockchain.

3. To investigate the impact of author’s collaboration and team size from

author’s collaboration network.

4. To identify top countries based on their national and international collab-

oration from country collaboration network.

5. To build a country ranking based on their national and international col-

laboration.

6. To perform thematic analysis to demonstrate the usage of major themes

in top countries.

Further, the study is organized as follows: Section 2 is on data descrip-
tion and feature extraction. Section 3 presents the view on the growth and
impact of blockchain, highlighting the temporal distribution of publications
along with publication categories and citations analysis. Section 4 presents
the author‘s collaboration network analysis highlighting the author’s contri-
bution, strength, and team size. Section 5 is on the country collaboration net-
work analysis highlighting the country-wise authors and leader, their national
and international collaboration, countries ranking based on their national and
international collaboration, and thematic analysis of technology across coun-
tries. Finally, Section 6 concludes the study.

2 Methodology

The methodology section covers two main stages (i) data collection, and (ii)
feature extraction to perform a structured review.

2.1 Data collection

Data is collected from Web of Science powered by Clarivate Analytics (https:
//webofknowledge.com/). The choice of the database is arbitrary. This study
preferred the WoS database because its authenticity and reliability (Gor-
raiz, Melero-Fuentes, Gumpenberger, and Valderrama-Zuri´an, 2016; Mart´ın-
Mart´ın, Orduna-Malea, Thelwall, and Delgado-L´opez-C´ozar, 2019). The pro-
cess started with the search of the keyword “Blockchain” in the whole WoS
database as (KP=(blockchain) OR AK =(blockchain)). The query returned
the 6790 records from 2014-2020. The data is extracted on Feb 2021. The
metadata contains the information of publication year, authors, aﬃliation,
journal, publisher, citations, downloads, research category, open access cate-
gory, publication language, reprint address, etc. The metadata is prepared on
articles, reviews, letters, editorial materials, and proceedings.

2.2 Feature extraction

Before starting with the bibliometric analysis, we performed feature extraction
on the data as follows:

4

K.Sharma et al.

– To ﬁnd the trend of publications, all 6790 documents were arranged as per

the year of publication.

– To identify the open access designations of each paper, the papers with
Gold, Bronze and Green categories are ﬁltered. This process returned 1597
(23.5%) as Gold, 237 (3.5%) as Bronze, and 193 (2.8%) as Green publi-
cations. 4763 (70.2%) publications belong to the no open access category
(NOA).

– To ﬁnd the publications distribution as per the language of publication, a

publication count of each language is prepared.

– To measure the impact of publications, the citations received and usage

count of each article is observed.

– The number of publications corresponding to authors and country was
not available directly, hence the information is extracted from the author’s
aﬃliation. A total of 17686 unique authors and 106 countries were extracted
from the data. Similarly, the national and international contribution is also
ﬁltered from the aﬃliations.

– To extract country-wise total publications and authors, we gave equal
credit to multi- authored and aﬃliated publications. Hence, we came up
with 9550 publications.

– Countries information of corresponding authors is extracted from the reprint
address. Also. country collaboration information is collected from the pub-
lication address.

– Themes corresponding to the top 10 countries are extracted from every

individual paper manually.

3 Growth and impact of blockchain

The results are presented in three phases. The ﬁrst phase is on the growth
and impact of blockchain which is discussed through the bibliometric analysis.
This phase mainly highlights (a) the temporal distribution of the number of
publications along with the categorization of the open-access documents; (b)
the dominant publication language; (c) the documents category along with the
number of publications in that category and citations received; and (d) the
impact of the publications.

3.1 Temporal distribution of publications

Literature growth of the blockchain has been studied by many researchers in
the past (Miau and Yang, 2018); however, the relation of such growth with
open access has not been analyzed earlier. Here, we analyzed the publication
trend and its association with the open access publication. Fig. 1 shows the
number of papers published from 2014-2020 [%]. In 2016, the growth measured
as 4.26% as compared to the past performances, and it has gone up by three
times in 2017 (13.73%). Hence, a rise in the number of publications can be

Blockchain bibliometrics

seen from 2017 onward. A sharp rise of publication count of 18.42% can be
seen in 2019; however, a fall of 0.57% is observed in 2020. The temporal trend
also shows that studies on the blockchain have gained momentum in 2018.

There are numerous advantages of publishing open access (Antelman, 2004;
Mart´ın-Mart´ın, Costas, van Leeuwen, and L´opez-C´ozar, 2018). In Fig. 1 the
pies on top of each bar represent the distribution of publications in terms of the
open access (OA) category. There are three main open access categories- Gold
(colored in gold), Bronze (colored in brown), and Green (colored in green),
and fourth belongs to no open access (NOA colored in grey). The open-access
publications lead to the visibility of the research work and the acceptance
towards this can be seen here.

The contribution of Gold OA publications has risen as 20.8% in 2016;
however, in 2017, the share was 11.3%. In 2020 (34.6%) this contribution
hyped 1.5 times as compared to 2019 (20%). We also observed that with the
rise in Gold OA publications, the NOA submission has gone down by 1.2 times
in 2020 (59.3%) as compared to 2019 (73.2%). Overall, the average number
of publications by Gold OA is 23.5% with average citations of 8.4, Bronze
OA is 3.5% with average citations of 6.6, and Green OA is 2.8% with average
citations of 14.1. On the other hand, NOA has a higher number of publications
(70.2%) with average citations of 6.4 (see Table.1).

Fig. 1 The bar plot represents the temporal trend of the number of papers published [%]
during 2014-2020. The pie plot on each bar represents the distribution of the open-access
publications. Three categories of open access publications are Gold (colored in yellow),
Bronze (colored in brown), and Green (colored in green). The fourth category belongs to
No Open Access (NOA) (colored in grey).

3.2 Measure publication impact through citations, usage count and open
access

The quality and visibility of English publications are far better than any other
language. Further, publications in English do not require any translation at
the international level. Hence, even the countries where English is not the ﬁrst
language, authors do prefer to publish in English. This gives an opportunity to
authors to present their work at international platform (Meneghini and Packer,
2007). Papers on Blockchain are published in 17 languages but 98.2% of them
are published in the English language as shown in Fig. 2. There are 34 papers
published in Spanish, 32 in Russian, 17 in Portuguese, and 11 in Turkish. In
total 1.8% (122) papers are published in languages other than English and the
majority are the articles.

Fig. 2 Pie plot shows the language-wise distribution. Papers got published in 17 languages;
however, the major publication is in the English language followed by Spanish and Russian.

A box plot of documents category in Fig.3 (a) shows the number of publica-
tions and corresponding citations. 49.7% of publications have been submitted
as articles, 44% as conference proceedings, and 4.4% as reviews. The average
number of citations received by articles is 9.1, proceedings as 3.9 and reviews as
16.9. Although the contribution as proceedings is nearly equivalent to articles,
however, the average citations of proceeding articles is very low as compared
to articles. On the other hand, the review has the lowest count but the highest
average citations among the three. So, this raises a question that is the pub-
lication category of proceedings is NOA? So we have analyzed that only 7.7%
proceedings are published as OA. Hence, the visibility is low and so are the
citations. On the other hand, 47% of articles are published as OA and 54%
reviews as OA which means the visibility is higher so are the citations. Hence,
the impact of this distribution is clearly reﬂected in the citations.

The visibility, inﬂuence and the impact of the publications can be directly
measured through the citations, usage count, and open access (Wang, Fang,
and Sun, 2016; Larivi`ere and Sugimoto, 2018). Fig.3 (b) shows the relation-
ship between the number of citations and the paper’s inﬂuence. The paper’s
inﬂuence is measure through the usage count provided by WoS. It provides
insight into how much interest a publication has generated among users of the
platform. The visibility of the publication is twice the actual citations, i.e., the

Blockchain bibliometrics

average number of citations received by blockchain-based publications is 7.1
and the average number of downloads received by blockchain-based publica-
tions is 16.3. Overall only 2.9% of publications are highly cited that received
more than 50 citations which are mainly as articles and reviews. Mainly, the
highly cited papers have been viewed 2.5 times than it received citations.

During 2017-18, OA count has decreased but during 2019-20 it has gained
the momentum (see Fig. 1). In 2019, the share of OA publications was 26.8%
and 40.7% in 2020. Base on this, in 2016 the average number of citations
received by NOA publications is 54.7 and OA is 45.3. As we can see that
25% of OA publications have on an average 45.3 citations which itself reveals
the impact of OA. Similarly in 2019, 26.8% of OA publications received on
an average 41.6 citations. Further, we analyzed that 43.7% of publications
are published by IEEE, followed by 9.9% by Springer, 9.7% by Elsevier. The
broader categorization of disciplines highlights that the major contribution
of the blockchain is in the ﬁeld of Engineering & Technology followed by the
second highest in Social Sciences (see Table. 1).

4 Author’s collaboration network analysis

The contribution of the individual author can be analyzed through the au-
thor’s collaboration network (Sharma and Khurana, 2021). Here, the author’s
contribution analysis phase highlights (a) the author’s collaboration network;
(b) statistical analysis of collaboration network; and (c) authors contribution
in several publications, author pair and the publications, and the number of
publications in teams.

4.1 Author collaboration network

An undirected network of the author’s collaboration is shown in Fig.4 (a). Out
from 17686 authors, only 14748 authors shared at least one collaboration. So,
the network consists of 14748 nodes and 45919 edges. The nodes in the net-
work represent the authors and the edges represent the possible collaborations
between two authors. A link appears between two nodes when two authors
have a joint publication. The size of the node reﬂects the number of connec-
tions an author has with others (degree) and the width of the edge reﬂects
the number of times the same two authors collaborate (strength). The overall
network comprises 1947 weakly connected components (subgraphs colored in
light grey) and out of these the giant component (the biggest connected sub-
graph) consists of 46.3% of nodes (colored in light sky blue). The number of
nodes in the giant component is highlighted in a red circle in Fig.4 (b). The
distribution shows that one component/subgraph has nearly 104 nodes and
a couple of components are in the range of 102 and the rest are below that.
The degree of the network represents the number of connections an individual
node has in the network as shown in Fig.4 (c). The degree distribution follows
the power law with exponent −2.45 and R2 = 0.88. 10% of nodes have degrees
greater than 10 and a couple of nodes have degrees higher than 102.

Fig. 4 (a) An undirected author’s collaboration network consists of 14748 nodes and 45919
edges. The nodes in the network are authors and edges are the collaboration link among two
authors. The nodes in the network are colored in grey and light sky blue. The nodes colored
in light sky blue corresponds to a giant component of the network and the grey nodes are
other weakly connected components. The network is constructed with open-source software
Gephi. (b) The distribution of 1947 weakly connected components with the giant component
marked in the red circle. The giant component consists of 46.3% of network nodes. (c) The
degree distribution of nodes obeys the power law with exponent −2.45 and R2 = 0.88.

bution of all authors has been measured in terms of the number of publications
and collaboration is presented in Fig. 5 (a). The distribution of author’s contri-
bution follows the power law with exponent −2.65 and R2 = 0.99. The analysis
reﬂects that 73.7% authors have published a single paper on blockchain till
now, and 14% published two papers whereas more than 10 papers have been
published by < 1% of authors. Also, the most active collaboration is being
highlighted in Fig. 5 (b). Here, the relationship between the author pair and
the collaboration strength follows the power law with exponent −2.64 and
R2 = 0.99. The analysis shows that 73.5% of author pair has published a
single paper, 14% of author pair has published two papers, 5.7% published
three, and 0.5% has published more than 10 papers together. This highlights
that only a few authors are frequently doing the research on blockchain. Fur-
ther, the team size contribution reﬂects the collaborative patterns in Fig. 5
(c). 38.7% papers are written by the individual author, 28.9% are written by
the team of two authors, 16.5% are written by the team of three authors, and
3.5% papers are written by the team of more than 5 authors.

5 Country collaboration and thematic analysis

The progress of an individual country in terms of publications, collaboration,
etc. can be beautifully analyzed through the country’s collaboration network.
Here, the country contribution analysis phase highlights (a) the country col-

laboration network; (b) country-wise the number of authors and publications;
(c) ranking of countries based on national and international collaboration; and
(d) thematic analysis of technology across countries.

5.1 Country collaboration network

An undirected network of country collaboration in Fig.6 (a) shows that how
diﬀerent countries have come together to explore the potential of blockchain
in diﬀerent research areas as well as technologies. The network consists of 106
nodes and 4009 edges. The nodes in the network represent the countries and
the edges represent the possible collaborations between two countries. A link
appears between two nodes when the two countries have a joint publication.
The size of the node reﬂects the number of connections a country has with
others (degree) and so as the label of the node. The width of the edge reﬂects
the number of times the same two countries collaborate (strength). Among
all, GBR collaborated with a large number of countries (degree=69) followed
by the USA (68), China (65), Australia (56), India (52), and so on. 10.9%
countries collaborated with a single country, and 58.1% countries collaborated
with more than 10 countries.

106 countries across the globe have contributed to the research on blockchain.

Fig.6 (b) shows the contribution of top 20 countries in terms of (i) number
of publications (sorted), (ii) the number of authors, (iii) the proportion (in
%) of lead authors (corresponding author), and (iv & v) the proportion (in
%) of authors lead the national collaboration and international collaboration.
After giving equal credit to multi-aﬃliated publications, the total number of
publications become 9550. The total number of lead authors is 7709 and 23.9%
of lead authors are only from China. Publication contribution of top countries
includes China (18.2%), USA (13%), GBR (5.8%), India (5.4%), South Korea
(4%), Australia (3.8%), Canada (3.4%), Germany and Italy (3.3%), Spain and
Russia (2.3%), and others ¡2%. The proportion of authors and lead authors
(corresponding authors) of top countries include China (22.8%, 23.9%), USA
(11.6%, 11.2%), GBR (4.5%, 4.2%), India (6.4%, 5.6%), South Korea (3.9%,
4.9%), Australia (2.8%, 3.6%), and so on.

In Fig.6 (b), we also looked into the the distribution of authors within the
country. Out of 4016 authors from China, 45.8% authors acted as lead authors
(both nationally and internationally) and 35.1% has lead the international
collaboration. Similarly, in USA out of 2066 authors, 41.7% of authors acted
as lead authors and 25.2% lead the international collaboration. In case of GBR,
out of 799 authors, 45.4% of authors acted as lead authors and 45.2% lead the
international collaboration, which is highest among to three.

Fig. 6 A demonstration of the country collaboration network with 106 nodes and 4009
edges. The nodes in the undirected weighted network represent the country and edges rep-
resent the collaboration. The size of the nodes is dependent on the node degree and the width
of the edges represents the strength of collaboration. The highest collaboration is shared by
the USA and UK followed by China, India, Australia, etc. The network is constructed with
open source software Gephi.

5.2 Ranking based on national and international collaboration

Porter et al. (Porter, Cohen, David Roessner, and Perreault, 2007) proposed a
way to measure research interdisciplinarity based on the relation between the
subject categories. Here, we analyzed the national and international collabora-
tion of the top 20 countries based on the number of publications produced by

12

K.Sharma et al.

all individual countries. We calculated the national and international ranking
of countries based on the share of national and international collaborations
paired in the total publications of the individual country. China, India, South
Korea, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, and Japan have collaborated more na-
tionally whereas GBR, Australia, Canada, France, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,
and Singapore share more international collaboration based on collaboration
share in the number of publications produced by them (see Fig. 7). The plot is
sorted in ascending order based on the number of international collaborations.
Singapore published a total of 121 publications and out of this, the share of
international collaboration is 83.6%, i.e., Singapore shared more international
collaboration out of its total publications. The second highest is Saudi Arabia
with 75.9% of international collaboration out of a total of 160 publications. The
third highest is GBR with 69.5% of international collaboration out of a total of
562 publications. On the other hand, the USA retained the balance between
national and international collaboration. In terms of national collaboration,
Russia published 222 publications with a national share of 79.3%. The second
highest is South Korea with 71.4% of national collaboration out of a total
of 390 publications, and the third-highest in India with 63.9% of national
collaboration out of a total of 515 publications.

Fig.7 (b) shows the ranking of the top 20 countries based on national and
international collaboration. The rank is calculated based on the share of na-
tional and international collaboration out of the total number of publications
by 20 countries. China is higher in the number of publications, authors, and
lead authors, so it ranked 1st both nationally and internationally. While main-
taining the balance between national and international collaboration, USA
ranked 2nd both nationally and internationally. GBR ranked 7th in national
and 3rd in international collaboration. India secured ranked 3rd nationally and
6th internationally. On the other hand, Russia ranked last in international and
SGP ranked last in national collaboration.

Fig. 7 (a) Bar plot represents the country-wise proportion of international and national
collaboration [in%] (top 20 in number of publications). The data is sorted based on the inter-
national contribution. (b) Ranking of top 20 countries based on national and international

5.3 Thematic analysis: Mapping of countries and keywords

Identifying the main features of the theme (Velez-Estevez et al., 2020) and
the ﬂow of the themes within applications can be understood well through
thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006; Vaismoradi, Turunen, and Bon-
das, 2013). The thematic analysis identiﬁes, analyzes, and reports the theme
(patterns) within the data (Chen, Song, Yuan, and Zhang, 2008). Author key-
words are the common units of analysis, reﬂectors, and research evidence of
the studies. The broader sense of the research topic and the area of study can
be identiﬁed through the author’s keywords. Fig.8 shows the thematic analysis
of such keywords in the form of the word cloud and alluvial diagram. After
excluding the keyword “Blockchain” which is our main keyword of search, a
word cloud of the rest of the author’s keywords is shown in Fig.8 (a). The size
of each word reﬂects the frequent use (count) of that particular keyword. The
highlighted keywords in the study except blockchain are Smart Contracts, Bit-
coin, Internet of Things (IoT), Security, and Distributed Ledger Technology
(DLT).

Further, the keywords used in the top 10 countries with the highest number
of publications are extracted. We have identiﬁed that keywords like supply
chain, smart contract, security, DLT, and IoT are used frequently with other
keywords like industry 4.0, healthcare, cyber, data privacy, cryptocurrency,
consensus, etc. Hence, a relationship between the top 10 countries and ﬁve
major themes along with the further level of keywords usage is shown in Fig.8
(b). The choice of the top 10 countries here is just to show the implementation
of ﬁve major themes along with other keywords in diﬀerent countries and
these countries have a large number of publications as mentioned in 5.1. Also,
an interesting fact of blockchain publication is that the number of authors
have explored the potential of this technology with recent trends like AI, IoT,
5G, and cyber security, etc. (Ante, 2020b; Fosso Wamba, Kala Kamdjoug,
Epie Bawack, and Keogh, 2020).

6 Discussion and conclusion

The present study presents the bibliometrics analysis on the blockchain that
covers many gaps in the literature. This paper provides insight and meaningful
implications regarding the popularity of blockchain across the globe from 2014-
2020 with diﬀerent perspectives (i) impact of open access publications on the
growth and popularity of blockchain; (ii) to investigate the patterns of author’s
contribution, collaboration strength, and team size; (iii) to identify the ranking
of countries based on the national and international collaboration; and (iv) to
perform thematic analysis on the literature to investigate the major themes.
As blockchains become more mature, this study also introduces its real-
world scenario in a comprehensive way. Most of the reviewed publications
agree on the promising advantages of introducing blockchain in diﬀerent sec-
tors (Ante, 2020a). Combining blockchain with current application trends can
certainly improve the eﬃciency of existing systems (Yu and Sheng, 2020). By
identifying and analyzing the most related papers, the key ﬁndings of the work
can be summarized as follows:
1. The bibliometric analysis on 6790 publications on blockchain from 2014-
2020 is performed. In the temporal distribution of the publications, the
continuous growth has been observed since 2014. The trend shoes the rise
of 4.26% in 2016 and gone up ﬁve times in 2017. In 2020, a minor decay of
0.5% is being observed in the publication count. In 2016, 25% publications
were open accessed in nature and its impact can be observed in the number
of citations later in 2020. The average citations received by OA publications
is 1.5 times more than the NOA. During 2017-18, OA count has decreased
but during 2019-20 it has gained the momentum. In 2019, the share of OA
publications observed is 26.8% and 40.7% in 2020. Base on this, in 2016
the average number of citations received by NOA publications is 54.7 and
OA is 45.3. As we can see that 25% of OA publications has on average 45.3
citations which itself reveals the impact of OA. Similarly in 2019, 26.8% of
OA publications received on average 41.6 citations.

2. Papers on blockchain were published in 17 languages worldwide; however,
the major publications are in the English language followed by Spanish and
Russian. The broader publication categories are (i) articles (49.7%), (ii)
conference proceedings (44%), and (iii) review (4.4%). The average num-
ber of citations received by articles is 9.1, proceedings as 3.9 and reviews
as 16.9. Although the contribution as proceedings is nearly equivalent to
articles, however, the average citations of proceeding articles is very low as
compared to articles. On the other hand, the review has the lowest count
but the highest average citations among the three.

3. The paper’s inﬂuence is measure through the usage count and citations
provided by WoS. It provides insight into how much interest a publication
has generated among users of the platform. The results shows that the
visibility of the publication is twice of the actual citations, i.e. the average
number of citations received by blockchain-based publications is 7.1 and the
average number of downloads received by blockchain-based publications is

16.3. Overall only 2.9% of publications are highly cited that received more
than 50 citations which are mainly as articles and reviews. Mainly, the
highly cited papers have been viewed 2.5 times than received citations.
4. The contribution of total of 14748 authors has been analyzed in author’s
collaboration network. The analysis reﬂects that 73.7% authors have pub-
lished a single paper on blockchain till now, and 14% published two papers
whereas more than 10 papers have been published by < 1% of authors. The
analysis of collaboration strength reﬂects that 73.5% of author pair are such
that have published a single paper, 14% of author pair has published two
papers, and 0.5% has published more than 10 papers together. This shows
that a long and strong collaboration in the ﬁled is almost negligible. Fur-
ther the patterns of team size highlights that the 38.7% of publications
are written by single author, and 28.9% are written by a team of two au-
thors. Only 3.5% of publications are produced by the team of more than 5
authors. This show that people prefer to work in small groups.

5. Further the contribution of 106 countries in the ﬁeld was analyzed through
country collaboration network. The results highlight that 10.9% of coun-
tries have collaborated with a single country, and 58.1% countries have
collaborated with more than 10 countries. Among all, GBR collaborated
with a large number of countries followed by the USA, China, Australia,
and India. Overall, Chain is leading in the number of publications followed
by the USA (13%), GBR, India, and so on. Similarly, the number of au-
thors are also lead by China (22.8%) followed by the USA India, GBR, and
so on.

6. The national and international collaboration of countries is analyzed by
the number of publications produced by every individual country. China
is higher in the number of publications, authors, and lead authors, so it
ranked 1st both nationally and internationally. While maintaining the bal-
ance between national and international collaboration, USA ranked 2nd
both nationally and internationally. GBR ranked 7th in national and 3rd
in international collaboration. India secured ranked 3rd in nationally and
6th internationally. On the other hand, Russia ranked last in international
and SGP ranked last in national collaboration.

7. At last, a thematic analysis is performed on the literature to investigate
the major themes. A thematic analysis observed ﬁve major themes as sup-
ply chain, smart contract, security, DLT, and IoT. we further observed
that the ﬁve major themes are used quite often with other keywords like
industry 4.0, healthcare, cyber, data privacy, cryptocurrency, consensus,
etc. Hence., the mapping of these observed themes has been analyzed in
top 10 countries. An interesting fact of blockchain research is the fact that
a number of authors have explored the potential of this technology with
recent trends like AI, IoT, 5G, and cyber security, etc.

6.1 Limitations and future work

The limitations and further expansion of the above study can be discussed as:

– The choice of the dataset (Mart´ın-Mart´ın et al., 2019): We have collected
the data from WoS for the study whereas the number of records varies
among the diﬀerent datasets, hence the study can be extended with the
data from Google Scholar, Scopus, Dimension, etc.

– Author collaborations: The present study analyzes the author collabora-
tion with the help of network analysis but it does not explore the gender
disparity to analyze the contribution and collaboration gender-wise. Hence,
the study can be extended gender-wise to analyze the role of women in the
development of blockchain technology.

– Application development: The study analyzed the literature based on types
of publications but lacks the in-depth analysis of the ideas introduced by
the authors. For example, whether the publication is on applications of
blockchain or it’s on consensus algorithms etc. Hence, the study can be
extended based on the kind of idea an author has presented and citations
received by the idea.

Authors contribution: Both the authors conceived and designed the

analysis, collected the data, performed the analysis and wrote the draft.
