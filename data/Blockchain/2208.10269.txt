Abstract

We study the competition between blockchains in a multi-chain environment, where a
dominant EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) co-exists with an alternative EVM-
compatible (e.g., Avalanche) and an EVM-incompatible (e.g., Algorand) blockchain. While
EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over
to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the ﬁrms to build more loyal and
“sticky” user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to be EVM-
compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also an important strategic decision.
In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and
ﬁnd that at equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain.
To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly subsidize
the new entrant ﬁrms or (2) oﬀer better features, which in practice can take form in lower
transaction costs, faster ﬁnality, or larger network eﬀects. We ﬁnd that it is easier for EVM-
compatible blockchains to attract users through direct subsidy, while it is more eﬃcient for
EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users through oﬀering better features/products.

1 Introduction

A commonly held belief in the web3 and blockchain community is that the future is multi-chain.
In particular, although Ethereum has so far been the dominant blockchain platform in terms of
developer and user adoption, there are a number of other layer-1 projects that are gaining signiﬁcant
market shares. Some of them are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, which makes
them relatively easy for both Ethereum developers and users to adopt, since they share the same
peripheral tools and applications (e.g. programming languages, wallet software, chrome-plugins,
block-explorers). Examples of these include Avalanche, NEAR-Aurora, and Polkadot-Moonbeam.
There are also blockchains that are not EVM compatible. Examples of such layer-1s include
Solana and Algorand. There is often signiﬁcant friction in users who have already adopted EVM
compatible chains adopting non-EVM compatible chains, and vice-versa. There are many sources
for such friction. First, EVM incompatibility generally means that both users and developers have
to use a diﬀerent set of tools to access, and develop applications for that blockchain. This means
that there is a steep learning curve for users already familiar with the EVM ecosystem to adopt
another. Additionally, many cross-chain solutions (i.e. bridges) launch on EVM-compatible chains
ﬁrst, making it harder for users to move their assets across incompatible chains. As such, for both
blockchains and developers, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not just a technological decision,
but also an important strategic choice. On the one hand, EVM compatibility makes it easier to
attract existing Ethereum users. Large existing user bases also generate positive network eﬀects.
On the other hand, being incompatible with EVM creates a “lock-in” eﬀect, which makes users
more “sticky” in the future, which allows developers to capture more surplus. In this paper, we
aim to answer two related questions:

1. What types of blockchain platforms will developers and users adopt? Will they choose
Ethereum or other EVM-compatible blockchains? or will they adopt EVM-incompatible
blockchains?

2. What strategies can blockchain platforms deploy in order to attract the adoption of developers

and users?

We develop a two stage Bertrand competition game to examine the incentives of ﬁrms and users in a
multi-chain setting. We show that at equilibrium, the new entrant ﬁrms/developers will adopt the
dominant blockchain with the most existing adoption, regardless of whether or not the alternative
blockchain is EVM compatible.

All else being equal, the incentives for a new entrant to build on the dominant blockchain
instead of an EVM-compatible alternative chain is intuitive. The dominant blockchain oﬀers the
largest existing user base and the largest positive network eﬀect. When the new entrant builds on
the same chain as the incumbent, they share the positive network between all of their users. As
such, they will not compete as ﬁercely on price to attract users.

If the new entrant instead develops on the alternative EVM-compatible blockchain, it will no
longer share the network eﬀect with the incumbent ﬁrm, and will need to engage in intense price
competition with the ﬁrm on the dominant chain to attract users. Since the alternative blockchain
has a smaller existing user base and network eﬀect, the ﬁrm must be very aggressive in its’ pricing
strategy in order to attract users, resulting in smaller proﬁts.

What about when the ﬁrm builds on an EVM-incompatible blockchain? Since incompatibility
makes it harder for users to switch products, ﬁrms might be able to extract more surplus from users
if they are built on diﬀerent incompatible blockchains. Surprisingly, in this case, ﬁrms earn even
less than the case when they are built on the EVM-compatible alternative chain. The intuition is
that even though the ﬁrm can now extract more rent from users that it has captured (due to higher
user stickiness), it needs to engage in more ﬁerce price competition in the beginning to capture
these users in the ﬁrst place. In fact, the competitive dynamic in the ﬁrst round of our two stage
game is so strong that ﬁrms might even oﬀer negative price. This lowers the aggregate payoﬀs of
the ﬁrm adopting the EVM-incompatible blockchain.

To avoid this “winner takes all” equilibrium and attract the adoption of ﬁrms and users, alter-
native blockchain platforms have to either (1) directly subsidize the new ﬁrm, or (2) oﬀer better
features (e.g. faster ﬁnality, and lower transaction costs).

We show that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users via direct subsidy,
while it is more eﬃcient for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users by oﬀering better fea-
tures. More precisely, compared to EVM-incompatible blockchains, EVM-compatible blockchains
can attract the new entrant ﬁrm with smaller subsidies. This is because, at equilibrium, when the
new ﬁrm is built on an EVM-compatible blockchain, the incumbent ﬁrm adopts a less aggressive
pricing scheme to attract users, which leads to a larger proﬁt margin for both ﬁrms.

A less direct way to attract ﬁrms to the alternative blockchain is through oﬀering better user
experience and better features at the blockchain level. As mentioned above, this can be in the form
of lower transaction fees and better security, but it can also be achieved through more peripheral
applications, and other complementary services. When two ﬁrms oﬀer a comparable service at the
product level, the one that is built on the better blockchain will be able to attract more users.
This in turn implies that the ﬁrm that is built a superior blockchain will be able to charge a higher
price, and thus earn more proﬁts. As a result, the new entrant ﬁrm will choose this alternative
blockchain. We show that in our model, EVM-incompatible blockchains are able to more eﬃciently
attract more users using this approach, meaning that for each unit of increase in blockchain quality,
the EVM-incompatible chain is able to attract more users than a EVM-compatible chain.

Literature review The study of network eﬀects [4] and switching costs was an active research
area from the 1980s to the early 2000s, motivated by the then nascent industries of telecommuni-
cation and software development platforms. A series of papers focused on the eﬀect of switching
cost on competition [6, 5, 1]. These papers showed that under diﬀerent modeling assumptions, the
presence of switching cost tend to increase competition between the ﬁrms in earlier periods. This
is because switching cost increases the ﬁrms ability to extract more surplus from their existing
adopters, which motivates the ﬁrms to compete more ﬁercely earlier on to capture more new cus-
tomers. Building upon these insights, more recent papers [7, 9] model switching cost as a strategic
decision by the platform, and analyze the diﬀerent settings when ﬁrms might want to adopt a
lock-in strategy by intentionally creating incompatibility and thus switching costs. For a more
comprehensive survey of these topics, see also [2, 8, 3]. Our paper presents a model that combines
a few diﬀerent elements from the existing literature, and presents an analysis of the network eﬀect
and switching cost in the context of blockchain applications.

2 Model Description

Let there be three blockchain platforms: two EVM-compatible blockchains, P1 and P2, and one
EVM-incompatible blockchain, P3. There are two ﬁrms, an incumbent A on P1, and a new entrant
B.

Blockchain Platforms. Blockchains P1 ,P2, and P3 have existing user bases N1 ,N2, and N3
respectively. A larger user base leads to a larger positive network eﬀect for users, and ﬁrms
account for this eﬀect when choosing platforms. We assume that N1 > N2 = N3. That is, the
EVM-compatible blockchain P1 has the largest existing user base. Readers can think of P1 as the
Ethereum blockchain which has seen the widest adoption amongst users and developers. P2 and P3
are two newer, alternative layer-1 blockchains that compete with Ethereum. P2 is EVM-compatible
(e.g. Binance Smart Chain), and P3 is not (e.g. Algorand).

Firms. Firms A and B build similar applications on blockchain, such as a decentralized exchange
(DEX) or a lending service. We assume that the product oﬀered by the ﬁrms are inter-operable,
meaning that if they are built on the same blockchain, they both beneﬁt from the network eﬀect
of each other’s users. An example of this would be DEXes on the same chain: with the rise of
DEX aggregators, the liquidity found on multiple DEXes on the same blockchain can often be
atomically accessed by users at the same time. This would not be true if they were built on two
diﬀerent blockchains. We assume that ﬁrm A is already built on the largest blockchain P1 at the
start of the game. Firm B is a new entrant who will choose a blockchain to launch its application
in period t = 0. The game will then proceed as a two-stage Bertrand competition, where in each of
the two periods t = 1, 2, the two ﬁrms set prices for their services, denoted as pAt, pBt respectively,
to maximize their aggregate payoﬀ. We assume that their discount factor is equal to 1 and that
the marginal cost of production for both ﬁrms is 0.

Blockchain users. There is a continuum of users indexed by x on the unit interval [0, 1] according
to increase personal preference for ﬁrm B. All users can gain a beneﬁt of k > 0 from using the
service oﬀered by either ﬁrm. Users choose their platform myopically in each period to maximize
their payoﬀ. We denote the endogenously determined number of users who choose ﬁrms A and B
in period t, t = 1, 2, as nAt, nBt respectively. The one-period payoﬀ of a user of type x in period
t, t = 1, 2, is given by:

Ut(x) =

α(N1 + nAt + nBt) − pAt − sx + k,
α(N1 + nAt + nBt) − pBt − s(1 − x) + k,
α(N1 + nAt) − pAt − sx + k,
α(Ni + nBt) − pBt − s(1 − x) + k,
0,

chooses A, A and B on P1
chooses B, A and B on P1
chooses A, B on Pi, i 6= 1
chooses B, B on Pi, i 6= 1
chooses neither .

The parameter α measures the network eﬀect, and the parameter s > 0 measures the degree of
dispersion of consumers’ preferences. As can be seen from users’ payoﬀs, with prices held constant,
users beneﬁt the most from the network eﬀect when the two ﬁrms are built on the same blockchain.
We impose the following technical assumption to avoid several trivial corner cases, including
the case where network eﬀects are so strong (α is too large) that only one ﬁrm would have users
in equilibrium, and the case where the beneﬁt of users from using products is so low (k is too low)
that most users will drop out of the blockchain platforms.

Assumption 1. The following relationships hold:

1. s > α(2N1 + 1)

2. k > 4s + 4α(1 + N1 + N2)

Blockchain incompatibility and user stickiness
If a user adopts a product in the ﬁrst period,
then we assume that he faces an additional switching cost if he wishes to use a diﬀerent product
in the second period. We assume that this switching cost is zero if both ﬁrms are built on an
EVM-compatible blockchain. More speciﬁcally, if ﬁrm B chooses to build on either P1 or P2, users
will have a switching cost of 0 in the second period. However, if the two ﬁrms are built on two
incompatible blockchains (i.e. B is built on P3), then users face a non-zero switching cost in the
second period. For simplicity, we assume that the switching cost is +∞ in this case. This creates
“stickiness” amongst the adopters of each ﬁrm. Intuitively, ﬁrms A and B may take advantage of
user stickiness in the second period to extract as much rent as possible.

Timeline. The timeline of the model is given as below:

• Period 0: Firm B picks a blockchain to oﬀer its product on.

• Period 1: Firms A and B set prices for their products, and users then make their purchase

decision.

• Period 2: Firms A and B may adjust the prices for their products, and users then make their

purchase decision.

Deﬁnition 1 (Equilibrium). An equilibrium consists of

1. Firm B’s platform adoption strategy in period 0 and pricing strategy in periods 1 and 2,

dB = (a, pB1, pB2), and

2. ﬁrm A’s pricing strategy in periods 1 and 2 dA = (pA1, pA2).

We say that (dA, dB) is an equilibrium if it constitutes a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.

3 Equilibrium analysis and implications

In this section, we will ﬁrst focus on the subgame in period 1 and 2, and examine the equilibrium
behavior of both the users and the ﬁrms under diﬀerent compatibility settings. Using this, we will
derive B’s platform adoption decision in period 0. After that, we extend our model to discuss how
blockchain platforms can incentivize ﬁrms, especially new entrants, to adopt their blockchains

3.1 Compatible blockchains

Suppose ﬁrm B also adopts an EVM-compatible blockchain, i.e. either P1 or P2. Recall that
switching cost is assumed to be zero in this case. As such, users’ decisions in period 2 do not
depend on their decisions in period 1. From the point of view of ﬁrms A and B, they are playing
an identical game of Bertrand competition in each of the two periods. If there exists a unique
Nash equilibrium for the one-stage Bertrand competition, denoted as (pA, pB), then there exists a
unique subgame perfect equilibrium where in each period, ﬁrms A and B set the prices as (pA, pB).
We will analyze the case when B chooses P1 vs P2 separately, and solve for the equilibrium

prices and payoﬀs in both cases.

Same blockchain Because two ﬁrms are built on the same blockchain, the positive network
eﬀects for the two ﬁrms are identical, so the adoption decision of users are only based on the prices
and their individual preferences. Consider the user xS who is indiﬀerent between the two ﬁrms:

α(N1 + nAt + nBt) − pAt − sxS + k = α(N1 + nAt + nBt) − pBt − s(1 − xS) + k.

Solving the above equation for xS gives us:

xS =

1
2

+

pBt − pAt
2s

.

If the marginal user xS has non-negative surplus, then all users with type x < xS would choose
A and all others will choose B. Suppose this is true for now, we now consider the Bertrand

4

competition between two ﬁrms. Firms maximize their one-stage proﬁts:

πAt = pAtxS = pAt(

1
2

+

pBt − pAt
2s

)

πBt = pBt(1 − xS) = pBt(

1
2

+

pAt − pBt
2s

)

This will give us a system of ﬁrst order conditions which we can solve to pin down the equilibrium
prices:

pS
At = pS
It is easy to verify that all users have non-negative payoﬀ when the prices are set at (pS
Bt).
Therefore the ﬁrms one-period payoﬀs at equilibrium when they are built on the same blockchain
are given by

Bt = s

At, pS

The total proﬁts of the ﬁrms over two periods are then

Compatible but diﬀerent blockchains Recall that this is when ﬁrm A is built on P1 and ﬁrm
B is built on P2. Unlike the previous case, ﬁrms A and B no longer share the same platform, nor
do they share the same positive network eﬀect. Instead, they have to maintain the network eﬀects
through attracting enough users to their platforms.

We again ﬁrst solve for user who is indiﬀerent between the two platforms:

α(N1 + nAt) − pAt − sxC + k = α(N2 + nBt) − pBt − s(1 − xC ) + k,

Again, if the marginal user xC has non-negative payoﬀ, then everyone with type x < xC would
adopt ﬁrm A and everyone else would adopt ﬁrm B. This means that nAt = xC , nBt = 1 − xC .
Solving for xC gives us

xC =

αN1 − αN2 + (s − α) − pAt + pBt
2(s − α)
Note that the expression depends not only on prices but also on the existing user bases. In
particular, the larger the existing network eﬀect there is on a ﬁrm’s blockchain, the more customers
that ﬁrm is able to capture. Following the same procedure as in the previous case, we can solve
for the equilibrium prices of ﬁrms as well as their equilibrium payoﬀs:

It is also easy to verify that all users have positive payoﬀ when the prices are set at (pC

The total proﬁts over the two periods are simply twice the above amount:

The following proposition summarizes the equilibrium results when ﬁrms choose compatible

blockchains:

Proposition 1. Suppose ﬁrm B chooses an EVM-compatible blockchains (i.e. either P1 or P2).
The following holds in equilibrium for the subgame starting in period 1:

1. (Same Chain) If ﬁrm B chooses P1 in period 0, then the prices set by ﬁrms A and B are
B = s. Users with x < 1

Bt = s,for both t = 1, 2. Their aggregate payoﬀs are πS

2. (Diﬀerent Chain) If ﬁrm B chooses P2 in period 0, then the prices set by ﬁrms A and B are
for both t = 1, 2,. Their aggregate payoﬀs are

Implications of Proposition 1 When ﬁrms are built on the same blockchain, users see no
diﬀerence between the two ﬁrms, and the two ﬁrms oﬀer the same price and capture the same
fraction of the market. When ﬁrms are built on two compatible blockchains however, the ﬁrm
with bigger network eﬀect is at a signiﬁcant advantage: not only does A capture more of the
new market, it is also able to charge more per customer. The following corollary is an immediate
consequence from comparing the payoﬀ of ﬁrms:

Corollary 2. The following results hold:

1. πC

B < πC
diﬀerent blockchains. The gap of payoﬀs |πC

B, i.e., the payoﬀ of ﬁrm B is lower when choosing diﬀerent blockchain relative to the

3. If the diﬀerence between existing user bases of two blockchains is small, i.e., N1 − N2 ≤ 3,
then πC
At, that is, the payoﬀ of ﬁrm A and the prices set by ﬁrm A are lower
when ﬁrms choose diﬀerent blockchain, relative to the case when both ﬁrms are on the same
blockchain.

At < pS

A < πS

A, pC

Implications of Corollary 2.
(1) The ﬁrst result is intuitive. To compensate for its’ smaller
existing user base, ﬁrm B needs to set a lower price, relative to ﬁrm A, to attract users. As a
result, its proﬁt is also lower than that of ﬁrm A in equilibrium. In particular, the stronger the
network eﬀect (i.e., α), the larger the price gap and proﬁt gap are. (2) Firm B’s proﬁt is lower
when the B builds on P2 instead of P1. The reasons are two-folds. First, since N2 < N1, ﬁrm B
starts with a smaller existing user base relative to ﬁrm A. Second, by building on a diﬀerent chain,
ﬁrm B no longer shares the network eﬀects from the users of ﬁrm A. This means that ﬁrm B has
to deploy a more aggressive pricing strategy (which means lower price) to attract users. (3) When
the gap between existing user bases are not too big, relative to the case where ﬁrms are on the
same blockchain, ﬁrm A and B need to compete more aggressively when they build on diﬀerent
blockchains. This erodes the proﬁt of ﬁrm A because A now needs to charge a low price.

3.2

Incompatible blockchains

We now switch our attention to the case when ﬁrm B oﬀers its product on the EVM-incompatible
blockchain P3.
In this case, both ﬁrms will have high user stickiness in period 2 due to high
switching costs between incompatible blockchains. Intuitively, this will allows the ﬁrms to avoid
price competition and extract more surplus from users.

To analyze this formally, we ﬁrst derive the equilibrium behavior of ﬁrms and users in period
2. Since we assume that switching cost is +∞ when chains are incompatible, users cannot switch
ﬁrms. Suppose user x chooses ﬁrm A in the ﬁrst period, his best strategy in the second period is
to stay with ﬁrm A if the price pA2 is low enough for him have non-negative payoﬀ: α(N1 + nA2) −
pA2 − sx + k ≥ 0. Otherwise, he buys nothing. We can then write the demand function for ﬁrm
A as follows:

min{ k+αN1−pA2
0,

s−a

, nA1},

if k ≥ pA2 − αN1
otherwise.

nA2 =

(

Given nA1, ﬁrm A wants to maximize pA2nA2 in period 2. Recall k > 4s + 4α(1 + N1 + N2)

from Assumption 1. One can check that the equilibrium price and adoption are given by

p∗
A2 = k + αN1 + (α − s)nA1
n∗
A2 = nA1

(9)

(10)

That is, ﬁrm A would oﬀer the maximum price such that all adopters of A from the ﬁrst period
would weakly prefer to stay with ﬁrm A than leaving the system. We can use the same steps to
show that given nB1, the optimal price and adoption for ﬁrm B in period 2 are given by

p∗
B2 = k + αN2 + (α − s)nB1
n∗
B2 = nB1

(11)
(12)

6

Given the equilibrium behavior of the users and the ﬁrms in the second period, we can now derive
how ﬁrms would price their products in the ﬁrst period. Since users are myopic, we can use the
same procedure as in Section 3.1 to derive that, for a given pA1, pB1, the market shares for A and
B at equilibrium are:

nA1 = xI
nB1 = 1 − xI

xI =

αN1 − αN2 + (s − α) − pA1 + pB1
2(s − α)

(13)

(14)

(15)

where all users with type x < xI would adopt A and everyone else would adopt B. Now, when
setting the price in period 1, both ﬁrms try to maximize their aggregate payoﬀs:

πB = pB1nB1 + p∗

The following proposition characterize the equilibrium results when ﬁrm B adopts an incom-

patible blockchain:

Proposition 3. Suppose that ﬁrm B adopts platform P3 in period 0. In the subgame that starts
in period 1, the following holds:

1. In both periods, users with type x < 5(s−α)+2α(N1−N2)

Implications of Proposition 3. We can see that the equilibrium price of ﬁrm i ∈ {A, B} in
period 1 is decreasing in users’ stand-alone value for the product, k, as well as the existing user
base on its blockchain Ni. This might seem counter intuitive, as bigger user base correspond to
higher price in the compatible case. The relationship here is reversed due to the fact that the
higher the k and Ni, the more the ﬁrms can extract from users in period 2. As a result, ﬁrms are
willing lower their prices in period 1 to attract users. We can also see that when users’ willingness
to pay is suﬃciently large in period 2 (k, Ni are suﬃciently large), the ﬁrms are even willing to
oﬀer negative prices in the ﬁrst period! This can be realized in the form of subsidized trading
fees, and other liquidity mining incentives. Moreover, the expressions of aggregate payoﬀs do not
contain k. This is because all the surplus extracted from users in period 2 are competed away in
period 1 in the Bertrand competition.

We are now ready to compare the payoﬀs of ﬁrms in the two cases and characterize the full

equilibrium. The following results can be inferred immediately by comparing π∗

are lower compared with their payoﬀs in the diﬀerent but compatible blockchains case. When
blockchains are incompatible, users switching cost allows both ﬁrms to attract rent from users in
period 2. As a result, the competition between the ﬁrms to attract users in period 1 is more intense,
and they need to adopt very aggressive pricing strategies, which lead to a lower overall payoﬀ for
both ﬁrms. (2) Since πS
B, all else being equal, the new entrant ﬁrm B would prefer
to build on P1. Intuitively, this is due to the fact that when ﬁrms build on the same blockchain,
they share the network eﬀect, and thus do not need to compete as ﬁercely for market share. When
ﬁrms adopt diﬀerent but compatible blockchains, they need to compete more ﬁercely for market
shares because there is no shared mutual beneﬁts between the ﬁrms. When they adopt diﬀerent
and incompatible blockchains, the need to compete for market share is even stronger (in the ﬁrst
period). This is because ﬁrms are essentially monopolies over their adopters in the second period,
and so they have strong incentive to capture as much of the market in the ﬁrst period as possible.

3.3 How to attract ﬁrm adoption

In the previous section, we established that all else being equal (security, scalability, time to
ﬁnality, etc), the new entrant ﬁrm B will be likely to build on the most popular platform P1 on
which ﬁrm A is also built. Viewed from the perspective of a blockchain platforms, our results
suggest that alternative layer-1’s that have not captured as much adopters as Ethereum will need
to oﬀer additional incentives for developers to build on their platform.

There are two natural ways for blockchain platforms P2, P3 to attract the adoption of new en-
trants: (1) directly subsidizing the new entrant ﬁrm, (2) improving user experience (e.g., providing
higher throughput and thus lower transaction fees, and providing faster settlement time). In this
section, we will extend our model and analyze both options.

Directly subsidizing new ﬁrms
Subsidizing developers is a common tactic observed empiri-
cally: many alternative layer-1’s have signiﬁcant ecosystem funds for supporting developers12. In
contrast, Ethereum blockchain currently provides less direct subsidization to developers. To under-
stand the eﬀect of subsidization more formally, we extend our baseline model to allow blockchain
platforms P2, P3 to subsidize new ﬁrms by oﬀering a one time payment of c if the ﬁrm builds on
their platform.

Proposition 5. The following results hold:

Suﬃciently large subsidy induces new entrant to adopt P2 or P3. Since π∗

costly for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract adoption because of more intense competition.
If both P2 and P3 can oﬀer subsidies, and c1 and c2 are their subsidy amount respectively, then

B < πC

ﬁrm B would want to choose P2 if and only if

B + c2 ≥ max{πS

On the other hand, B would want to choose P3 if and only if

(23)

Since the ﬁrm’s decision depends on both c2 and c3, P2 and P3 have to strategically set their subsi-
dization policies in order attract the ﬁrm. However, we will not be providing a formal equilibrium
analysis for the subsidy strategy in this paper.

Improving user experience Platforms can also attract adoption by improving users’ stand-
alone value of the product (k in our model). Note that the user’s experience with a product is a
function of both the product itself, as well as the blockchain that the product is built upon. This
means that if a blockchain is fundamentally better, users are more likely to pick products that are
built on the better blockchain. This would increase the payoﬀs of the ﬁrms built on the better
blockchain. As mentioned before, such improvement take diﬀerent forms, including: faster ﬁnality
time, more secure transactions, and lower gas fees. We extend our model to include an additional
factor d, which represents the extra utility that the user gets from using platform P2 (or P3). Using
the same procedure as in our baseline model, we can arrive at the following characterization of the
equilibrium results:

Proposition 6. Suppose that users earn an additional beneﬁt d from using platform P2. Firm B
will choose P2 if d > d∗
+ N1 − N2. In such a case, the equilibrium prices
in period 1 and 2 are

Users with type x < xC =

would choose ﬁrm A, and the rest choose ﬁrm B.

Implication of Proposition 6 When blockchain P2 is signiﬁcantly better than blockchain P1
(d is suﬃciently large) , the new entrant will use blockchain P2. This is because with higher extra
beneﬁt d, more users will choose platform P2, which makes building on P2 more proﬁtable for the
ﬁrm. The large the d, the higher the price pC
Bt ﬁrm B can charge to users on platform P2, and the
higher the payoﬀ of ﬁrm B from building on platform P2. This result implies that EVM-compatible
blockchains with much lower transaction costs and faster settlement time may have a chance to
out-compete the incumbent Ethereum blockchain. In the following Proposition we will state the
analogous result for the non EVM-compatible chain:

Proposition 7. Suppose that users earn an additional beneﬁt d from using platform P3. Firm B
chooses P3 if d > d∗

Implication of Proposition 7. EVM-incompatible blockchains with better user experience can
also attract new entrant ﬁrm. Moreover, one unit increase in d increases users adoption (1 − X I )
by 1
5 . Comparing this with the case for EVM-compatible blockchain in Proposition 6, we see that
this number is lower at 1
6 . This suggests that it is comparatively more eﬀective for incompatible
blockchains to attract users and developers via oﬀering a fundamentally better blockchain.

Increasing network eﬀects. Another way that platforms can make themselves more attractive
to users/ﬁrms is through acquiring bigger user bases and thus larger positive network eﬀect (i.e.
N2 or N3). Mathematically, this has the same eﬀect as improving user experience, since increasing
N2 or N3 is equivalent to increasing the beneﬁt of users on that blockchain, k. Therefore we can
draw the same conclusions as above for ﬁrms’ ability to attract users per unit increase of existing
network eﬀect.

4 Conclusion

Our analysis shows that, absent of external incentives, developers tend to “tip” to one domi-
nant chain due to the network eﬀect. Our analysis also highlights interesting strategic diﬀerences
between EVM-compatible and incompatible blockchains. Compared to incompatible alternative
layer-1s, compatible layer-1s can attract ﬁrms from the dominant blockchain with less direct sub-
sidy. On the other hand, for every unit increase in the “quality” or the existing user base of
blockchain, incompatible chains gain more user adoption. One key dynamic that we do not capture
in our model is negative network eﬀect (i.e. congestion). We leave it to future work for incorpo-
rating negative network eﬀect to better predict adoption patterns between diﬀerent blockchains.
