Abstract—Cybersecurity is an inherent characteristic that
should be addressed before the large deployment of smart
city applications. Recently, Blockchain appears as a promising
technology to provide several cybersecurity aspects of smart city
applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the
existing blockchain-based solutions for the cybersecurity of the
main smart city applications, namely smart healthcare, smart
transportation, smart agriculture, supply chain management,
smart grid, and smart homes. We describe the existing solutions
and we discuss their merits and limits. Moreover, we deﬁne the
security requirements of each smart city application and we give a
mapping of the studied solutions to these deﬁned requirements.
Additionally, future directions are given. We believe that the
present survey is a good starting point for every researcher in
the ﬁelds of cybersecurity, blockchain, and smart cities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that permits the tracking
and exchange of
resources and assets in a secure and
transparent manner [282]. Assets are anything having a value
and can be tangible (such as houses, cars, moneys) or
intangible (patient vital signs, copyright, digital documents)
[225].

inherent

characteristics, Blockchain
technology has gained a lot of attention world wide. The
number of scientiﬁc papers and industrial projects dealing
with blockchain is signiﬁcantly increasing [85]. According to

2

Gartner report, Blockchain will support the global movement
and tracking of 2 trillion of goods and services annually by
2023 [85]. Moreover, Blockchain technology will continue its
evolution and integration in industrial and business projects
and it will reach its maturity by 2030 [85].

Although there are several works dealing with blockchain,
there is no single survey that gives an overview about the use
of blockchain in smart cities applications and the mapping of
these solutions to the requirements of these applications. The
present survey tries to ﬁll this gap by presenting an exhaustive
survey about the use of blockchain for the cybersecurity of
smart cities applications and present future directions and open
issues that need to be addressed by the industrial and scientiﬁc
communities. We believe that this survey is a good starting
point for researcher working around the cybersecurity, smart
cities, and blockchain ﬁelds.

A. Review of Related Surveys

including privacy,

As an emerging technology, blockchain has gained a lot
of attention from researchers and, therefore, several surveys
have been proposed. Some surveys are related to the use
of blockchain in IoT such as [19, 223, 80, 79, 114]. For
instance, authors in [19] presented a comprehensive survey
about applications of blockchain in IoT. They ﬁrst presented
blockchain fundamentals and the consensus algorithms. Then,
they presented the motivation for integrating blockchain with
IoT. Moreover, they reviewed the proposed solutions to achieve
security in IoT,
identity management,
trust, and main security goals. The paper [223] analysed
unique features of blockchain technology and outlined various
ways of integrating IoT and blockchain. For this purpose,
the authors discussed the challenges, beneﬁts and open
issues of
they
reviewed existing IoT-blockchain platforms and applications.
Similarly, [80] surveyed existing blockchain protocols for IoT
networks and provided a classiﬁcation of threat models. The
authors in [79] described the use of blockchain in IoT-based
applications including sensing, smart
living applications,
intelligent transportation systems, wearable devices, supply
chain management, mobile crowd sensing, etc.

the IoT-blockchain integration. Moreover,

The survey [225] studied the security services provided
by blockchain technology independently from smart cities
applications. They focused on the use of blockchain
technology to ensure secure network services and outlined
associated challenges with the proposed blockchain-based
approaches.

Some surveys on blockchain focused on a single application
of smart cities such as smart home [186], smart healthcare
[53, 231, 76], and smart transportation [107]. Note that, these
surveys will be cited in their corresponding section in this
paper.

The widespread adoption of blockchain technology in smart
cities applications has led to the appearance of several surveys
papers. The most related ones to our work are presented in
Table I.

The authors in [182] reviewed the technical implementation
of Blockchain technology in different academic and industrial

this survey enriches this state of

Differently from previous surveys that have either addressed
the security of smart cities independently from blockchain
technology or those that have focused on a single smart
cities application,

art by discussing the blockchain based solutions for the
cybersecurity of multiple smart cities applications, namely:
transportation, smart agriculture,
smart healthcare, smart
supply chain management, smart grid, and smart homes
(Figure 1). Table II highlights the key differences between the
present survey and the most recent related surveys. It is clear
from this table that some features such as Blockchain beneﬁts,
requirements, and the citation of existing surveys for each ﬁeld
of smart cities are missing in previous surveys. Moreover,
the mapping of smart cities requirements with the reviewed
solutions is slightly studied by only paper [245]. In Table
II, we also indicated the number of papers reviewed in each
survey for each smart cities applications. It is worth noting
that the number of papers discussed in the present survey
is signiﬁcantly bigger than the one of the previous surveys.
Moreover, some applications such as agriculture and smart
homes are not addressed in previous surveys.

C. Structure of the Paper

The roadmap of this paper is as follows. First we start
by presenting an overview of the blockchain technology
(Section 2). Then we review the blockchain solutions for
each smart city application in a separate section. The studied

smart city applications are smart healthcare (Section 3),
smart transportation (Section 4), smart agriculture (Section 5),
supplychain management (Section 6), smart grid (Section 7),
and smart homes (Section 8). For each smart city applications,
we start by presenting the existing surveys, then we discuss
the beneﬁts of using the blockchain technology,
then the
application requirements,
then we give a mapping of the
reviewed solutions with these deﬁned requirements, and ﬁnally
we discuss future directions. Figure 1 presents the studied
smart city applications with their use cases.

II. BLOCKCHAIN OVERVIEW

Blockchain can be considered as a distributed ledger that
transactions. The key characteristic of

keeps track of all

blockchain is that it is an append only database, in other words
we can add a new transaction but we cannot update or delete
an existing one. These transactions are bundled into a block,
and blocks are linked together through a cryptographic hash
to form the blockchain. Moreover, the distributed ledger is
generally replicated at every node in the blockchain network.
These characteristics make blockchain a trustworthy and
immutable record keeping service.

A. Blockchain Structure

As shown in Figure 3, Blockchain is a chain of blocks.
A block consists of a block header and a block body, as
illustrated in Figure 2. The block header includes metadata
such as the block version, nonce, timestamp (the block time
creation), height (the block position in the chain), Merkle tree
root hash (computed over all transactions), parent block hash,
and current block hash. The block body contains a set of
transactions and the transaction counter.

The hash is computed for each block and inserted in the
subsequent block, which permits to cryptographically link
blocks together and make the blockchain immutable. As shown
in Figure 3, if an attacker tries to modify the value of a
transaction in block i, the hash of this block will be invalid
and therefore all subsequent blocks will be also invalid as
they contain (or use) this hash. The Merkle tree root permits
the fast searching of a transaction. The nonce is a random
number resolved by the block miner (the node that creates the
new block) and which must produce a hash below a speciﬁc
target.

B. Blockchain Characteristics

Blockchain technology has received a lot of attention
from both industry and academia due to its distributed,
decentralized, immutability, and transparency properties.

• Distributed: In blockchain, the storage of data is done
in a distributed manner. A distributed ledger is stored in
different nodes in the blockchain network. Moreover, the
decision to add new data (new block) is taken through
consensus protocol and not by a central entity.

• Decentralization: The blockchain system does not
require a centralized third party to operate in a P2P
manner. Transactions are endorsed in a decentralized
manner by the peer-to-peer network and without
the
intervention of a central entity.

• Immutability: The distributed ledger in Blockchain is
composed of a set of blocks linked together through a
cryptographic hash as shown in Figure 3. Alteration of
block data is impossible as it will make the modiﬁed
block invalid and all subsequent blocks. This makes
blockchain immutable and secure. Moreover, transactions
are signed with the help of digital signatures (Figure 3).
ledger,
transactions are validated by participant nodes. Therefore,
participants can track and view the changes on the
blockchain.

• Transparent: Before being added to the

C. Blockchain Types

Blockchain systems can be broadly classiﬁed into three

types as illustrated in Figure 4.

1) Public: A public or permissionless blockchain is a
decentralized open source platform that
facilitates every
individual to join and perform mining. There is no access
restriction and every participating node is able to write, read,
validate and mine blocks. Generally, a set of transactions are
bundled into a new block and participants compete to found
the right nonce (the mining process) in order to earn the
reward. The most well-known public blockchain is bitcoin and
Ethereum.

2) Private: A private or permissioned blockchain is a
decentralized network that allows private data sharing amongst
a speciﬁed group of people or within an organization. The
access to a private blockchain is controlled and generally
restricted to a speciﬁc group of people with the same afﬁliation
or ﬁeld.

Private blockchain also controls who can participate in
the consensus protocol. Although a private blockchain is
restricted and controlled by an authority it still beneﬁts from
other blockchain properties such as transparency, distributed
ledger, and consensus. The most known private blockchains
are Hyperledger, MultiChain [88], and Ripple.

3) Consortium: A consortium blockchain is a hybrid
version of private and public blockchain in which a group
of organisations control the access to the blockchain, and
the consensus and block validation decisions. As examples
of consortium blockchain platforms, we can cite Hyperledger
Fabric [27], Quorum [170] and Corda [46], that can be used
to deploy either consortium or private blockchains [156].

D. Consensus Mechanisms

The consensus mechanism in the blockchain is an important
component for the operation of the blockchain system as
it decides whether a block will be added or not. The ﬁrst
consensus mechanism which was proposed with the bitcoin
system is PoW. Due to the inefﬁciency of the PoW consensus
as it requires a lot of computation and energy power, several
new consensus methods were proposed.

1) Proof-of-Work (PoW): In this consensus algorithm the
miner nodes compete to ﬁnd the right nonce that gives a
hash value lower than a speciﬁed threshold. Therefore, the
node with more computational power will have more chance
to ﬁnd the appropriate nonce ﬁrst. Upon ﬁnding the valid
nonce, miners broadcast the block to all other network nodes
to verify it. If all the miners approve the block, it will be
appended to the existing chain. The ﬁrst miner who ﬁnds the
valid nonce will be rewarded and its block will be added to the
chain. The problem with this consensus algorithm is that high
computational power is wasted in solving the mathematical
puzzle.

2) Proof of stake (PoS): In this consensus mechanism the
nodes with more resources (more wealthy: having good stake)
have more chances to add a block to the network. Chances
of doing a block validation depends on the wealth of the
participating node i.e, its stake in the system. However, this

7

Fig. 3: Blocks are cryptographically linked, which makes them immutable

approach favours the wealthier nodes as they will receive
more block validation opportunities, and as a consequence
they become more dominant in the network which results in

centralization or unfair distribution.

3) Delegated proof of stake (DPoS): To overcome the

algorithm, the delegated PoS was proposed, which can be
considered the democratic version of PoS. DPoS is an elective
consensus scheme in which every node with a stake in the
network can vote for validator nodes. The validator nodes
called also witnesses will in turn valid new blocks.

4) Proof of Space: PoSpace is similar to PoW except that
the puzzle requires a storage space instead of computation
power. A miner proves its ability to create a new block
by allocating the required storage space to perform the
mining process. In other words, instead of having a high
computational capability, the mining node needs to show a
high storage capability.

5) Practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT): PBFT is a
consensus algorithm used where members are partially trusted.
PBFT tries to reach an agreement between participants even
the number of
in presence of malicious nodes. However,
malicious nodes must not exceed one-third of the total number
of participants. PBFT consists of three stages, which are
pre-prepare, prepare and commit. In all these three stages,
a node would move to the next stage only if it receives
the same reply from two-thirds of all
the nodes in the
network. This enables the PBFT consensus mechanism to
run effectively even under the presence of some malicious
byzantine replicas. PBFT suffers from scalability problems
due to the exponentially increasing messages with new nodes

addition.

6) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET): In the PoET consensus
algorithm, each node generates a random number and waits for
that random number. The ﬁrst node that completes its waiting
time has the opportunity to generate the new block.

7) Proof of authority (PoA): The proof of authority is based
on the identity of validators instead of their stakes. In other
words, the node with the well-reputed identity will be selected
to validate the new blocks.

III. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SMART HEALTHCARE

The integration of emerging IT technologies into healthcare
4.0 has raised the security concern. In this section, we
identiﬁed the main security requirements for next generation
healthcare applications and then we reviewed existing
blockchain based solutions and highlight how they can achieve
these security requirements. Finally, we give some open issues
that need to be addressed as future directions. First of all,
we start by presenting the state of the art of existing surveys
dealing with blockchain for healthcare.

A. Existing surveys Blockchain for healthcare

Although there are several surveys related to the use of
blockchain in healthcare applications [212, 171, 76, 231, 53],
[98, 6], [67], [295], [69] , [131], [96], [102], all of them do
not address the security aspects of the reviewed solutions,
except the paper [231] who has partly addressed the security
aspects, however, this paper was limited to only one use case
of blockchain in healthcare, which is the EHR management.
We summarised in Table V existing surveys focusing on the
application of blockchain for healthcare.

B. Beneﬁts of Blockchain to healthcare applications

The blockchain is a promising technology that will play
a vital role in empowering and developing next generation
healthcare applications. The various beneﬁts of the blockchain
to the smart healthcare applications can be summarised as
follows:

• Decentralization: healthcare applications are generally
distributed over several stakeholders, which requires a
distributed management system. Blockchain can provide
this decentralized management, where all participants and
stakeholders can control access to patients’ data, without
the need for a central authority.

• Improved data security and privacy: Blockchain
technology is immutable and therefore helps protect the
patients’ data from alteration or corruption. Moreover,
the real identity of patients are hid through the use of
cryptographic keys, which help to protect the privacy of
patients.

• Health data ownership: Through smart contracts,

applications, where the patient can control the access to
his health data. Thanks to well-deﬁned smart contracts,
the user can decide to which medical staff he/she will

• Availability and robustness: The data is stored on the
blockchain in a distributed manner and is replicated on
multiple nodes. This permits to guarantee the availability
of the data and increases the system robustness.

• Transparency and trust: By nature, the blockchain is
an open and transparent system, which increases trust
between the different participants and stakeholders.

C. Healthcare Applications Requirements

Based on the previously cited surveys (mainly [231]) and a
new security-based survey for healthcare 4.0 [97] , we have
identiﬁed the following requirements for a next generation
healthcare application (RH for Requirements for Healthcare
application):

• RH1: Authentication. Authentication is the ﬁrst

line
of defense for any healthcare application. Indeed,
to
be secure a healthcare application needs to carefully
authenticate every participant
in the system including
patients, doctors, care givers, etc.

• RH2: Access Control. Access control methods permit
to specify who can access the healthcare data and
the privilege level (read only, read and write, etc.).
In classical healthcare applications, patient data was
managed centrally by the hospital. Thanks to blockchain,
the patient can manage his data with a ﬁne grained access
control method.

• RH3: Privacy. The privacy of patients’ data needs to
be preserved. This can be done through cryptographic
techniques such as homomorphic encryption. Privacy
deﬁnes in which situation patient data might be accessed,
utilized, and disclosed to a third party.

• RH4: Integrity. Patient stored data needs to be protected
against any unauthorized modiﬁcation. Moreover, any
modiﬁcations or alteration of data need to be detected.
• RH5: Traceability. Also known as auditability or
accountability, tracks and audits who accesses the patient
data, with what aim, and the time-stamping of any
operation in the entire life cycle.

• RH6: Availability: we mean here ubiquitous availability
of data. More precisely, patient data can be accessed from
anywhere and distant access is possible.

• RH7: Interoperability. This requirement guarantee that
patient data issued by different organisations and with
different formats can be understood by each other. This
facilitates data sharing for
research and educational
purpose.

• RH8: Patient-Centric access control. This requirement
indicates that
to own his
the patient has the right
healthcare data and to control it. More precisely, the
patient will control which data is accessible to whom.
• RH9: Scalability. Healthcare applications generally
involve big data such as X-ray images, clinical data, etc.
Therefore, healthcare solutions designers need to take into
consideration the large volume of data generated.

D. Blockchain for Smart Healthcare Use Cases

Additionally, based on the previous surveys we have
identiﬁed four use cases of the applications of blockchain

Moreover, recommendations to different stakeholders

The authors have classiﬁed reviewed papers to six

in healthcare including secure EHR management, secure
health data sharing, secure remote patient monitoring, and
Pharmaceutical supply chain management.

1) Secure EHR management : Patient health data are
generally saved into an Electronic Health Record (EHR). One

of the popular applications of blockchain in healthcare is the
security of this EHR. In literature, the term EHR was used
interchangeably with Electronic Medical Record (EMR), and
Personal Health Record (PHR). The security of the EHR needs

to be achieved during its creation, storage, management, and
sharing. The main blockchain based EHR secure systems are
presented in Table XXIX and are discussed as follows.

An early conception of the use of blockchain to provide
conﬁdentiality, authentication, and accountability of EHRs was
described in [31], where the authors suggested using the
blockchain for medical data access control and permission
management.

The authors in [178] proposed an identity and access
management
system to provide EHR authorisation and
authentication. The proposed system was implemented using
Hyperledger Fabric Framework. [253] designed BHEEM, a
blockchain-based framework to securely store and maintain
EHRs.

[238] proposed a decentralized attribute-based signature
scheme for privacy-preserving of user identity during signature
veriﬁcation. The proposed scheme was deployed for the
security of EHR in healthcare. The decentralised EHR storage
system based on blockchain guarantees integrity, auditability,
and availability.

volume of healthcare data, some solutions proposed to store

The authors in [56] proposed Ancile, which is built on
the Ethereum blockchain platform and utilizes smart contracts
to achieve access control, data privacy and interoperability
of electronic medical records. The QuorumChain Consensus
algorithm [214] was adopted to determine the next block to be
added to the chain. Additionally, the authors used the concept
of proxy-encryption to store keys and small encrypted records
directly on the blockchain. Moreover, Ancile deﬁned different
smart contracts for each function of the system.

The work in [130] discussed and implemented different
medical workﬂows using Ethereum smart contract system for
secure EHR management. These healthcare workﬂows involve
complex medical procedures.

The authors in [243] used Hyperledger Fabric to evaluate the
performance of blockchain-based EHR systems. The authors
have also developed the algorithm for access control and
patient, clinician and lab interaction with the blockchain
network.

is OrbitDb with IPFS. They have adopted two channels:
the devices channel and the consultation channel. In fact,
the concept of channels enhances data privacy. Moreover,
they have adopted a patient-centric access control through
the execution of smart contracts to allow or deny access
to the patient’s health data. Therefore, data conﬁdentiality
is preserved. Note that only the hash of data stored in
OrbitDB with IPFS is saved in the blockchain to ensure data
integrity and auditability. Besides, the adopted approach is
fully decentralized providing no single point of failure which
ensure data availability.

2) Secure health data sharing: The authors in [263] [264]
proposed MedShare to securely share medical data stored on
the cloud. The proposed system implements smart contracts
and an access control mechanism to provide traceability and
permissions on data.

The authors in [75] proposed MedBlock to share healthcare
data for clinical and research purposes. MedBlock combines
access control protocols with symmetric encryption to provide
high-level security. One limitation of MedBlock is that
it
focuses only on hospital medical records of patients collected
from medical examinations and does not store the vital signs
of patients.

To transcend this drawback, Shen et al. [230], proposed
MedChain: a blockchain based healthcare data sharing system.
In addition to the EHRs of patients, MedChain shares also their
vital signs collected from the IoMT devices.

FHIRChain [288] was proposed to meet

the Ofﬁce of
the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
[195]
requirements for secure and scalable clinical data
sharing. These requirements include user identiﬁability, user
authentication, controlled data access, secure data exchange,
consistent data formats, and system modularity. In FHIRChain
each participant possesses a public/private key pair. The public
key will serve for user identity and the private key for
user authentication. To address the scalability requirements,
FHIRChain suggests keeping protected data off-chain and only
pointers of it are stored on the blockchain.

In [106],

the authors proposed a blockchain based
framework method called BiiMED. It permits to manage
and share Electronic Health Records (EHR) stored on the
cloud between different medical organisations. Additionally,
a Trusted Third Party Auditor (TTPA) based on blockchain
technologies was introduced. TTPA permits to validate the
exchanged data and ensures data interoperability and integrity.
3) Secure remote patient monitoring: To secure the remote
patient monitoring systems Griggs et al.[90], proposed to use
a consortium blockchain based on Hyperledger. The proposed
RPM system Gateway implements a smart contract to analyse
collected data (from sensors) and sends notiﬁcation to the
medical staff. The action of data read or doctors commands are
considered as transactions, which are stored in the blockchain.
One challenge of this solution is how to perfectly choose the
transmission time of the aggregated data to the blockchain
network.

The authors in [250] proposed a two-tier architecture; the
ﬁrst one ensures vital sign streaming and storage, whereas the
second one is responsible for key management. The lower tier

includes a patient centric agent (PCA), which is connected
to a blockchain network and a cloud system. The PCA is a
software that needs to be executed on a computer or server
and ensures three functionalities: medical Data Management
Module(DMM)
responsible for storage management and
compression, Security Service Module(SSM) responsible for
key management, and Miner Management Module(MMM) is
responsible for miner selection and blockchain interaction.
The proposed system used a modiﬁed version of the PoW
consensus algorithm, where only one miner is selected based
on its characteristics to add a new block to the network.
Moreover, the authentication of the different components of
the system was proposed and which is mainly based on XOR
operation and hash functions.

To provide anonymity and authenticity,[68] proposed to
use a lightweight privacy-preserving ring signature scheme
[167]. In ring signature, the signature is mixed with other
groups (named ring), to keep the identity of the signer private.
Moreover, the authors introduced the concept of clustering
the blockchain network to provide scalability. More precisely,
nodes are organized into clusters and in each cluster the cluster
head is responsible for the addition of new blocks. However,
the authors did not precise how clusters are formed and did
not evaluate their work.

The authors in [110] proposed an IoT-based blockchain
platform for
the secure remote monitoring of patients
physiological parameters. One limit of this solution is that
it stores the high volume of data generated by the medical
sensors into the blockchain nodes. This design choice requires
nodes with big storage space and leads to scalability problems.

Attia et al. [30], proposed to use two separate blockchains
to secure the remote monitoring of patients. One blockchain
manages the medical wearable devices and stores their
collected data, and the other blockchain manages
the
consultations and contains all the history of patients records.
moreover,
the NDN paradigm [22] was used to retrieve
data from the patient wearable devices. A prototype of the
proposed architecture was implemented using Hyperledger
Fabric Framework.

Recently, the authors of [283] proposed a new architecture
for a remote patient monitoring (RPM)
system based
on blockchain technology. The overall architecture of the
proposed RPM system is composed of a perception layer,
a network layer and an application layer deployed in the
cloud. In the application layer, the authors used Hyperledger
fabric integrated with Hyperledger Composer to implement
the business model of the RPM system in the blockchain
network. Note that the ledgers and transactions are deployed

Moreover, the wearable health devices and the IoT gateway
are considered assets of the blockchain network which ensure
data integrity and auditability. Besides, the participants which
are patients and doctors must be registered and enrolled in
the blockchain network to beneﬁt from RPM services. This
fact ensures data conﬁdentiality. Finally, the proposed system
is fully decentralized with no single point of failure which
ensures data availability.

been proposed for the supplychain management in the context
of healthcare.

Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems. They discussed

The authors in [109] proposed a blockchain based SCM
to check the drug integrity. The proposed system enables the
medical staff, patients, and pharmacists to manage, control
access, and share personal medical records and the complete
patient drug life cycle in a secure and transparent way. The
system was implemented using Hyperledger fabric and tested
using Hyperledger composer [55].

The authors

in [1] proposed a drug supply chain
management and recommendation system. The authors used
blockchain to track the drug delivery and detect the counterfeit
drugs. Moreover, a machine learning module was proposed to
recommend the best medicines. The authors used Hyperledger
Fabric as a blockchain framework and the N-gram, LightGBM
models as the machine learning method.

The authors in [235] proposed an SCM for drugs that

takes into consideration the temperature of the drug during
transit and storage. The solutions necessitate the presence of
a sensor in the drug box. Moreover, a QR code was used
to store drug information. To address the scalability issue
the bloXroute [135] servers are introduced. bloXroute are a
scalable blockchain distributed network. Moreover, the authors
suggested to use the Raft consensus protocol. The authors
made a security analysis. However, the solution requires the
presence of several pieces of hardware which can be difﬁcult
to provide such as smart transportation box, sensor nodes, and
dynamic QR code in each packet.

E. Mapping of existing solutions to Security requirements and
Future Directions

to the blockchain technology. However,

Table X shows the mapping of the previously reviewed
solutions to the speciﬁed healthcare requirements described
in subsection III-C. It is worth noting from this table that
some requirements such as authentication, access control,
integrity, and auditability are well fulﬁlled by the proposed
solutions. This might be explained that these security services
the
are inherent
interoperability requirement is rarely fulﬁlled by the existing
solutions. This is due mainly to the different formats of data
used in healthcare. Moreover, proposed healthcare solutions
use generally private blockchain, which fails to scale to
very high number of participants. Therefore, scalability is
another issue that needs to be resolved in healthcare solutions.
Additionally, the majority of healthcare solutions store the
patient data either on the blockchain or in the cloud. However,
blockchain cannot ﬁt the large volume of patient data. This
explains why some solutions opted for the cloud storage
solutions. However, storing data in the cloud might reveal
the privacy of the patient and expose the system to several
attacks. Finding a storage solution that overcomes these limits
is another future research direction.

The following open issues still need research focus for the

large deployment of blockchain based healthcare systems.

• Storage: Healthcare systems generate a large volume of
data that current blockchain systems fail to store directly
in the distributed ledger due to block size constraint.
Some solutions opted to store data in the cloud. However,
cloud based solutions might breach the privacy of patients
as some cloud systems might eavesdrop on patient data
for some business organisations. Another alternative was
to store data in the distributed InterPlanetary File System
(IPFS) and to store the hash produced by the IPFS system
in the blockchain. This is a hybrid off-chain/on-chain
solution, where patient data is stored off-chain and its
metadata (pointers and references to data) is stored
on-chain. Although, these solutions can partially solve the
storage problem of blockchain based ERHs management
they remain inefﬁcient, especially for RPM
systems,
systems that are composed of IoMT devices that generate
huge volumes of data at high speed. Some pioneer
proposals for storage efﬁciency need to be explored for
next generation healthcare systems [206, 57, 270].

• Scalability:

In addition to the storage limit, current
blockchain based healthcare systems did not scale to
the large community due to the inefﬁciency of existing
consensus algorithms. For example, the PoW consensus
algorithm consumes a lot of energy and has a low
throughput. The PBFT presents an O(n2) messages and
therefore cannot scale to a large number of nodes.
Moreover, existing blockchain based healthcare systems
are tested for few number of nodes and therefore, more
effort must be put to ﬁt these solutions to a large scale.
The following surveys can be a good starting point to
address the scalability problem [52, 292].

• Type of blockchain: although there are solutions for
types of blockchain (public, private, and

different

consortium). The consortium blockchain seems to be
the right choice for healthcare system. Indeed, public
blockchain breaches the privacy of patients as it allows
every participant
to read data. Private blockchain is
generally limited to one organisation and does not
support medical data sharing. However, consortium
blockchain can be established between different medical
organizations and hospitals and can impose access control
rules on the shared data.

• Interoperability: one problem of the healthcare systems
is that they use different formats for the medical data
recommended by different standards such as the Health
Level Seven International (HL7), Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and European
Committee for Standardisation (CEN). This characteristic
obstacle the data sharing between different stakeholders.
Indeed, data stored in blockchain need to have the same
format to be used by different stakeholders. More on
blockchain interoperability can be found here [40, 116].
• Standards and regulations: To improve compliance and
interoperability between developed blockchain based
healthcare systems standards and regulations must be
set up. Moreover, regulations must encourage blockchain
adoption between stakeholders. One objective of these
standards is to unify the EHR structure of the patient to
facilitate data storage and search when manipulated by
different entities.

• Privacy: Privacy is a major challenge in healthcare
industries. Patients cannot share their medical data if they
feel there is a risk of data leakage. Therefore, healthcare
systems need to preserve the privacy of their users. Due to
the transparency characteristic of blockchain, exchanged
transactions can be read and analysed by participants
in the blockchain network. If these transactions carry
sensitive healthcare data, this will lead to patients’ privacy
breaching. Some mechanisms have been put in place to
defeat the privacy problem such as ring signature, blind
signature, and other techniques that are discussed in the
following survey[78].

IV. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SMART TRANSPORTATION

identify the beneﬁts of

Connecting vehicles securely and dependably is essential
to the employment of modern Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) applications in smart cities. With the incessantly
emerging security risks, vehicles could be subjected to
a range of malicious attacks that could jeopardize the
safety of passengers, services, and information.
In this
the blockchain
section, we ﬁrst
model
to the ITS applications. Next, we describe the
major security necessities for ITS services. The main part
of this section will comprise an analysis of the systems
to integrate the blockchain
that were proposed so far
into the ITS. These systems will be divided into six use
cases: security and privacy of communications, autonomous
vehicles, smart parking, ridesharing and ride-hailing, security
and management of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and
the
miscellaneous applications. Lastly, we will discuss

16

challenges and future research directions of the blockchain
in smart city ITS (BITS). However, we will start by brieﬂy
outlining the existing surveys on BITS and the signiﬁcance of
our study as compared to them.

A. Existing BITS surveys

Table XI provides a summary of the most important papers
in the literature that provided comprehensive overviews of
the blockchain implementation and utilization in smart city
ITS. Wang et al. [254] studied the implementation of the
blockchain in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and analyzed it
from seven aspects, which are architecture, privacy, security,
trust management, data management, certiﬁcate management,
and data monetization. Xie et al. [265] focused on analyzing
three sides of the implementation of the blockchain in smart
city ITS, which are decentralized architecture, management of
vehicles’ communications, and charging of electric vehicles.
Sharma and Kaushik [229] identiﬁed 27 different kinds of
attacks on the ITS and discussed various security solutions,
including blockchain mechanisms, that were implemented to
defend and thwart these attacks.

incentive,

communication,

Peng et al. [205] categorized the blockchain systems in
the literature based on their positions in the IoV networking
layers, which are the Perception Layer; Networking Layer;
and Application Layer. For each layer, the authors classiﬁed
the blockchain mechanisms based on their purposes, such
security and privacy, or
as decentralization,
audit. The authors of [177] discuss the various blockchain
types, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts applicability,
computation,
and storage overhead in
blockchain-based vehicular communications. Mollah et al.
[185] identiﬁed eight main applications of the blockchain in
the IoV, which are Data Protection, Data Trading, Resource
Sharing, Vehicle Management, Ride Sharing, Content
Broadcasting, Trafﬁc Control, and Forensics. However, the
authors missed some very important blockchain applications,
such as those related to autonomous vehicles, Internet of
Drones (IoD), and smart parking. In this paper, we identiﬁed
the ﬁve main categories of blockchain applications in the
ITS. Each of these categories includes a large number (more
than 10) of systems that have been proposed so far for
utilizing the blockchain as part of the application. Various
other applications (on which a limited number of systems
have been proposed) will be discussed in the miscellaneous
category.

B. Blockchain Beneﬁts to ITS

The blockchain is expected to play a vital

role in
empowering and developing the ITS applications. Several
previous works identiﬁed various beneﬁts of the blockchain to
the smart city ITS. We summarize these beneﬁts as follows:
• Security and Safety: one of the most important factors
in the success of
ITS applications is securing the
data, execution, and communications of the applications;
and the safety of the application users (drivers and
passengers). With its decentralized validation and
immutable data, the blockchain can safeguard the ITS

important.
Several blockchain mechanisms have been proposed
that focus on establishing a trust-based environment
between the vehicular network members [175, 274,
160]. Implementing an efﬁcient trust-based distributed
blockchain mechanism that applies cryptography and
hashing operations will assist in keeping private data out
of the reach of attackers.

• Decentralized mechanism removes single point of
failure (SPoF) problem: most centralized management
and storage systems suffer from the SPoF problem. In the
blockchain, each node stores a copy of the ledger, and

all the nodes cooperate in taking the blockchain-related
decisions, which eliminates the SPoF issue.

• Automatization: the blockchain can be used for life-time
management and surveillance of ITS devices, which
assists in establishing a self-organized, self-adaptive, and
decentralized autonomous ITS ecosystem [280].

• Providing strong trust

for ITS users: since the
blockchain is transparent and all the network exchanges
are clearly expressed as immutable transactions within
the blockchain blocks, ITS users trust the blockchain data
that are utilized by the ITS applications.

• Providing incentives to various transportation nodes
(RSUs, vehicles, drones, etc.) to participate in the
ITS applications: many ITS applications require the
network nodes to perform operations that serve the

whole network, such as routing other nodes’ packets,
sending road trafﬁc-related data, performing part of the
application computations, etc[174]. Transportation nodes
may be reluctant
to execute these operations without
an incentive. The blockchain solves this problem by
providing the required incentive via the blockchain’s
built-in cryptocurrency system.

• Faster cloud services: several literature works proposed
utilizing edge nodes, such as the RSU network,
to
provide cloud services (such as money exchange) to ITS
users. Integrating the blockchain into such system enables
the ITS users to consume these services securely with
reduced delay, as compared to similar online services.
• Scalability: ITS networks can grow to include a huge
number of nodes. Several
research works proposed
scalability solutions for the blockchain based on efﬁcient
approaches, such as partitioning, sharding, and directed

acyclic graphs (DAGs) [125, 92]. Implementing similar
solutions enables the blockchain-based ITS application to
scale to a high degree in order to satisfy the transportation
network requirements.

• Connecting heterogeneous entities:

the blockchain
enables various types of nodes to join the blockchain
network and take part in the blockchain operations, such
as transaction management, consensus, and storage. As
long as a node commits to the blockchain protocols, it can
act as a blockchain node regardless of its type, structure,
and capabilities.

• Democracy: the correct implementation of blockchain
protocols ensures that each blockchain node has the same
rights as other nodes that have the same role. In general,
democracy is a very important feature that is desirable
by all smart city applications, not only the ITS.

C. ITS requirements

D. BITS Use Cases

19

The extensive review that we made on a large number of
ITS-related papers helped us to identify the main features that
are required by most ITS applications. These Requirements
for Transportation applications (RTs) can be summarized as
follows:

• RT1: Authentication: It guarantees that vehicles that
engage in network communications are trustworthy.
Without

behalf.

legitimate node

authentication,

• RT2: Conﬁdentiality: It certiﬁes that secrecy is granted
to sensitive information such that only rightful users can
access it. This requirement is vital for almost all ITS
applications.

• RT3: Availability: Information must be obtainable by
legitimate users in a timely manner. In many applications,
a certain delay would make the information lose its
signiﬁcant value.

• RT4: Data integrity: This feature means that the content
of data must not be changed, whether purposefully or
unintentionally, since the time it is generated. Several
ITS applications, especially those that are safety-critical,
demand that
the content of the exchanged messages
remains intact.

• RT5: Privacy: ITS applications generate and process a
large amount of information that is related to the privacy
of the ITS users. For example, drivers may not want to
disclose where they are going or with whom. Hence, ITS
applications should keep such information secret to their
owners.

• RT6: Access control: This security feature states that
each node should perform its various actions and
functions based on the privileges and limits that it is
assigned. In order to ensure access control, each node
should be given the correct roles and rights to access and
use the ITS application.
• RT7: Non-repudiation:

is the inability to refute
responsibility. This feature relates to the process that the
receiver of a message obtains a proof of the identity of
the sender, and that the sender is provided with a proof
that the information has been delivered to the receiver. In
ITS applications, compromised nodes can be detected by
non-repudiation.

It

• RT8: Latency guarantees: most ITS applications are
time-sensitive and some of
them are real-time. For
example, accident avoidance applications fail if the data
analysis results are not produced very quickly in order to
be able to alert the driver and avoid the accident. These
applications require that time constraints that are speciﬁed
by the application are strictly met.

• RT9: Scalability: Vehicular networks are characterized
by their large number of users, high mobility of vehicles,
and dynamic topology of
the network. With such
attributes, the vehicular network should be scalable in
order to enable the ITS applications to execute without
disruptions.

A large number of blockchain systems and models have
been proposed for
the smart city transportation system.
These systems span a wide range of applications that
belong to many ﬁelds/areas. In general, the ITS intersects
with different ﬁelds that we discuss in other sections of
this paper, such as healthcare, smart grid, and supply
chain. In this section, we focus on blockchain systems that
target ITS-dedicated applications related to driving, vehicular
communications, parking, passenger-support, etc. We assign a
separate subsection for each use case in which a large number
of blockchain systems and frameworks have been proposed.
We combine the use cases for which few systems have been
previously proposed per use case together in the Miscellaneous
sub-section.

1) Blockchain for General Vehicular Communications:

A blockchain-assisted ITS (Ba-ITS)
that grants privacy
protection to users combined with an incentive model that
prompts vehicles to provide data to the ITS was proposed by
Li et al. [150]. The system utilizes a hierarchical blockchain
structure that guarantees the interoperability among different
levels of blockchains. In addition, the authors propose several
methods that exploit smart contracts to offer ITS services
[160] propose a privacy-preserving
to users. Liu et al.
announcement scheme (BTCPS)
in which roadside units
(RSUs) calculate the reliability of each packet based on the
vehicles’ reputation values that are stored in the blockchain.
BTCPS utilizes the identity-based group signature method in
order to attain conditional privacy. The system exploits logistic
regression to boost
the sensitivity of reputation values of
malicious vehicles. Furthermore, a blended consensus protocol
is used to reduce the blockchain overhead. Although the
authors claim that their scheme provides privacy, this is not
true as the identity of vehicles can be revealed from the
public address used in the blockchain. Wang et al. [258]
propose TrafﬁcChain that utilizes the blockchain for trafﬁc
information collection. TrafﬁcChain is characterized by a
two-layer blockchain architecture which comprises a local
chain for each road segment and a global chain for the whole
network. The system makes use of edge/fog routers that act
as local miners of the local chains. Each block on the global
chain comprises the comprehensive information of the trafﬁc
status of each of the road segments. The authors utilize the
Long Short-Term Memory model to defend against Byzantine
and Sybil attacks.

Instead of the traditional Proof of Work (PoW), Haouari
et al. [94] propose the Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) as
a consensus mechanism for transportation systems. PoUW
requires the miner to solve an NP-hard optimization problem
whose results beneﬁt the supply chain by optimizing emission
levels and operational costs. Oham et al. [198] utilize a
permissioned blockchain to manage the access to restricted
elements of the vehicular ecosystem. The proposed B-FERL
protocol uses a challenge–response mechanism between the
vehicles and RSUs to observe the internal status of each
vehicle and detect cases of vehicle compromise. Lei et
al. [142] propose the blockchain as a means to simplify

the distributed key management in heterogeneous vehicular
networks. The blockchain enhances the key transfer handshake
procedure and helps to reduce the key transfer time during a
vehicle’s handover.

IoT services

the vehicular

The authors in [266] discuss a blockchain framework
to support
in SDN-enabled
5G-VANET. Here, a vehicle broadcasts trafﬁc information and
the near vehicles rate the packet. The RSU computes the
trust value of the packet based on the distance between the
scoring vehicle and the sending vehicle, and stores the trust
value into blocks. Javed et al. [112] propose a blockchain
model for reliable data sharing between resource constrained
vehicles and edge service providers. The proposed blockchain
uses the Proof of Authority (PoA) protocol
to validate
transactions. In addition, the system provides incentives to
edge nodes via the blockchain. The authors discuss a caching
model at the edge servers that can improve the blockchain
performance. Another system that aims at providing incentives
to vehicles to forward announcements was explained in
[146]. The authors propose an announcement network called
CreditCoin and a protocol called Echo-Announcement that
uses authentication and privacy thresholds to guarantee that
anonymous announcements are reliable. Users earn coins by
replying to the announcement request of others, and spend
coins to make an announcement.

Mershad et al. [175] proposed the Proof of Accumulated
Trust (PoAT) consensus protocol that aims at selecting the
blockchain miners among RSUs that accumulate enough trust
points to become trusted nodes (TNs). The blockchain blocks
are mined by one of the TNs who is called the current
miner (CM). The CM receives the transactions from the TNs,
mines the block, and broadcasts it to the TNs to achieve
consensus. The authors in [143] leverage the characteristics of
edge computing and blockchain to propose a blockchain-based
GPS positioning error evolution sharing scheme for the IoV.
The proposed scheme ensures the security of cooperated
vehicles and improves the localization accuracy. The scheme
uses smart contracts to automate the recording of positioning
errors and improve the positioning accuracy. Moreover, mobile
edge computing (MEC) nodes are used as miners to maintain
the blockchain and achieve the consensus. The authors in
[145] combine the blockchain and ciphertext-based attribute
encryption (CP-ABE) to create an access control scheme
for VANETs (FADB). The system uses Ethereum and the
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for distributed storage and
access control of data.

A joint
(NDN)-based
framework
was proposed in [219]. The framework maintains users’
privacy by using non-private information such as the plate
number of the vehicle in order to ensure the integrity and
accountability of the V2X communications. Bao et al. [36]
propose a blockchain system for pseudonym management
in the IoV. Within the blockchain, a pseudonym certiﬁcate
shufﬂing mechanism is applied in order to reuse existing
pseudonyms by assigning them to new vehicles. The system
utilizes asymmetric cryptography when sending blockchain
transactions in order to guard the pseudonym shufﬂe path.

Wang and Zhang [255] utilize the blockchain for secure data
sharing in vehicular networks. In the proposed scheme, the
vehicle sends the encrypted message to the RSUs, and the
latter invoke the veriﬁcation nodes to verify the encrypted
message via the Ripple consensus.
In addition, service
providers apply smart contracts to offer multi-dimensional
services to vehicles. The latter utilize the attribute-based proxy
re-encryption algorithm to search within the blockchain.

Tables XII and XIII summarize the papers that were
discussed in this section, while Table XIV maps each paper
to the BITS security requirements that were stated in Section
IV-C.

2) Blockchain for Autonomous Vehicles: An important
element of the next-generation ITS is the network of connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). CAVs are artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI)-empowered and computer- operated driverless vehicles
that can collaborate to monitor the nearby surroundings via
sophisticated sensor modules and take instantaneous and
appropriate decisions without human involvement. CAVs are
susceptible to a large number of safety and security problems.
Khoshavi et al. [132] highlight the advantages of utilizing
the blockchain in CAVs and demonstrate how the blockchain
can be effectively applied to the CAV technology. The
authors in [91] propose a blockchain-based architecture to
mitigate security and privacy issues in CAVs. The proposed
system is divided into four layers which are the data layer,
Ethereum layer, edge layer, and cloud layer. The CAVs send
their raw and encrypted data to the RSUs. The latter save
the transactions into the blockchain and execute the smart
contracts to select certain information and send it
to the
edge servers, while the latter cache the blockchain data that
passes between the RSUs and the cloud users. Rathee et al.
[218] discuss a blockchain model for autonomous cabs. The
blockchain is used to store the reading of the cab sensors
in order to protect the autonomous cab from attackers. The
IoT devices register on the Blockchain Network by sending
a subscription request to the peer manager. During the travel
of a user from one location to another, the vehicle’s number,
location, and current and previous vehicle ratings are captured
by the IoT devices and stored in the blockchain.

The fruit ﬂy optimization algorithm (FOA) was utilized
by Sharma et al. [228] to distribute the blockchain mining
fairly between various miner pools in a CAV. In the proposed
algorithm, miners are classiﬁed based on their previous
contributions to the blockchain. The algorithm selects the best
miner nodes that should handle each transaction request when
creating a new block. A sensing and tracking architecture for
CAVs was presented in [221]. The proposed system ensures
the secure sensing and tracking of any object of interest
via the blockchain. Wang et al. [261] present a blockchain
model to safeguard content delivery in autonomous vehicular
social networks (AVSNs). The proposed blockchain utilizes a
reputation assessment model to ensure the legitimate behavior
of CAVs and improve the content reliability. In addition,
the system proposes a proof of reputation (PoR) consensus
protocol
implements the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS)
that
multi-signature method.

mechanism for autonomous vehicles. In the proposed system,
a consortium blockchain is created by the manufacturers of the
AVs. Each manufacturer writes a smart contract that manages
the operations that update its AV ﬁrmware. In addition,
the blockchain is used to incentivize AVs to contribute to
the dissemination of new ﬁrmware updates from one AV
to another. The proposed model applies an attribute-based
encryption (ABE) technique to enable manufacturers to apply
to download and use
a policy about who has the right
an update. Pedrosa and Pau [203] utilize the blockchain to
securely record and handle the charging of electrical AVs. The
charging stations use the blockchain to publish their charging
rules and prices. The AV opens a channel to negotiate with
the station and commits to the negotiation parameters by

publishing them in the blockchain, which locks a number of
tokens for the AV during a timestamped period.

Table XV summarizes the papers that were discussed in
this section, while Table XVI maps each paper to the BITS
security requirements that were stated in Section IV-C.

3) Blockchain for Ride-Sharing and Ride-Hailing:
Ride-sharing is an ITS-based service that allows drivers to
share the road with other people, which provides many beneﬁts
such as joint travel cost and lessening trafﬁc congestion. On
the other hand, ride-hailing is a similar service in which the
rider speciﬁes to the driver the exact time and place of the ride.
Several recent papers proposed a variety of blockchain models
for these two services. Baza et al. [38] proposed B-Ride, a
decentralized ride-sharing system based on public Blockchain.

B-Ride enables the rider to post a cloaked pick-up and drop-off
location and time to the blockchain. The driver uses a matching
technique to examine if the demand falls on his course and
then sends the exact trip information encrypted with the rider’s
public key. To defend against malicious riders who send fake
requests and do not commit to them, the system implements
a time-locked deposit mechanism by utilizing smart contracts

and zero-knowledge set membership proof. Both the driver and
rider must demonstrate their good intentions by transferring a
deposit to the blockchain. After the ride, the smart contract
settles the balances based on the ride results. In addition, the
proposed blockchain applies a reputation model to rate drivers
and riders based on their previous behavior which incentivizes
them to abide by the system rules.

A multilayered blockchain architecture for ride-sharing
services was proposed in [226]. In the proposed system, the
client sends a Request message to a service node. The message
includes a nonce that uses the HMAC algorithm to avoid
leaking the identity and details of the client. The service
node broadcasts the request in the peer-to-peer network. When
a driver accepts to offer the ride,
it sends an encrypted
acknowledgement to the service node. The latter saves the
transaction in the blockchain and connects the driver to the
rider. After the ride, the transaction data are validated by
the service node and a new transaction that contains the
ride result is added. The authors in [49] use the Summary
Contract (SC), which is a dedicated blockchain smart contract,
to store the main information that identiﬁes each user based
on his/her sharing criteria. The blockchain uses the details
in the user’s request to ﬁlter the candidate drivers based on
the matching attributes within the passenger smart contract
(PSC) and driver smart contract (DSC). Li et al. [147]
make use of the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) method and
a permissioned blockchain for preserving the identity of
passengers and drivers. The system includes a permission
issuer node that issues prover keys to drivers and veriﬁer keys
to peer nodes. The latter store the blocks and smart contracts
of the permissioned blockchain and acts as the data veriﬁer
that validate drivers’ and riders’ identities.

GreenRide, a blockchain-based ridesharing application
was presented by Khanji
in [129]. The
proposed application emphasizes environment preservation
by promoting carbon emission reduction and enhancing air

and Assaf

quality. In order to incentivizing drivers to share rides with
passengers, the application rewards the driver with blockchain
tokens. A token is given to the driver for every kg of
CO2 reduced via sharing rides. A similar application called
BlockWheels was proposed by Joseph et al. in [118]. The
proposed application uses Drizzle to connect the application to
the blockchain using smart contracts in Trufﬂe. In addition, the
greedy mechanism is used to match riders with drivers, which
enables drivers to acquire passengers who are close to them.
A Practical Ethereum Blockchain based Efﬁcient Ride Hailing
Service (PEBERS) was proposed in [138]. PEBERS utilizes
RSUs as fog nodes that mine the blocks of a consortium
blockchain and match passengers with drivers. The blockchain
model uses the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus
algorithm in which validator nodes cooperate in order to
the blockchain does not fork at any time. A
ensure that
similar approach was proposed by Zhang et al. [290]. Here,
the Hash-oriented Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
based consensus algorithm was used by the authors to avoid
the double-spending and Sybil attacks.

this section, while Table XVIII maps each paper to the BITS

5G, ITS, and others to manage and execute the parking
operations in an efﬁcient manner. However, smart parking has
many challenges, such as communication bandwidth, energy
efﬁciency, integrity, security, privacy, and centralization [236].
A blockchain-enabled framework for Energy-Efﬁcient Smart
Parking in smart cities was proposed in [236]. The proposed
framework uses Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) for data

authentication and veriﬁcation of all smart parking zones
and drivers. In addition, a deep Learning LSTM network
is utilized at the analysis layer to process cloud data and
propose the best parking locations to the driver based on
his/her preferences, such as distance, price, and delay. A
collaborative blockchain solution with gamiﬁcation for parking
was proposed in [81]. In this approach, drivers who want to

park collaborate in order to ﬁnd which parking spots are empty
and satisfy each driver’s requirements. Each driver is rewarded
with blockchain points for each successful parking in which
the driver assists. The points are used by the driver to achieve
reduced parking fees or free parking time. The system utilizes
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to reduce the uncertainty
of the route optimization algorithm, allowing the system to ﬁnd
optimal paths to the desired parking place.

BSFP, a blockchain-based smart parking system with
Fairness and Privacy was proposed in [285]. The system
utilizes group signatures to achieve anonymous authentication
for drivers and parking owners, while granting the traceability
of malicious users. In addition, bloom ﬁlters are used to
preserve the location-privacy of range queries. On the other
hand, vector-based encryption is applied to restrict access
to blockchain transactions to authorized drivers and owners.
A crowdsensing framework that is used to assist the smart
parking system was proposed in [134]. The authors describe
a multi-blockchain structure that includes a public chain and
a private chain. The public chain utilizes the sensing data
from several contributors to allow any user to discover the
available parking locations and options. On the other hand, the
service providers and drivers process the data from the public
blockchain to generate parking transactions that are stored in
the private chain. A bridge node joins both blockchains and
creates channels to link and exchange information between the
two blockchains.

Jennath et al. [113] describe Parkchain, a system in which
parking pools are created to allow drivers to rent out their
unused land for a speciﬁed amount of time. The system
employs blockchain-based parking tokens to create digital
assets that are equivalent
to unused land. Smart contracts
are used to enforce the terms and conditions between the
parking spot owner and the driver, along with the tenure of
the hired property and the pricing options to be applied during
the lease period. In order to ensure fair parking rates, the
system in [32] uses a commitment technique that is applied
during the submission of the offers to the driver. In addition, a
short randomizable signature is utilized to authenticate drivers
during the reservation process while keeping the driver’s

ID anonymous. A consortium blockchain is used by the
drivers to store rating transactions that anonymously rate
the parking service and contribute to the reputation of the
parking service provider. Ahmed et al. [12] describe the details
of Parking-as-a-Service, which provides distinct application
interfaces for each type of participants, such as parking owner,
driver, and blockchain node. Multiple service providers can
utilize Parking-as-a-Service to offer their parking services to
drivers. Each service provider has a smart contract to generate
the parking offer transaction. When a driver consumes an offer,
the resulting transaction is validated by the blockchain nodes
to ensure that the transaction matches the details in the service
provider offer transaction.

this section, while Table XX maps each paper to the BITS
security requirements that were stated in Section IV-C.

5) Blockchain for Aerial Networks: A large number of
research papers proposed different mechanisms for integrating
the BC into the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) network,
which has been recently labeled the Internet of Drones
(IoD). Some of these systems employ the BC as a means
of safeguarding the data produced by the drones. Other
frameworks utilize the BC as a tool for overseeing the IoD
processes and keeping the history of the missions executed
by the UAVs for future searching. A third type of systems
makes use of the BC to provide UAV services to cloud users
by implementing smart contracts and ensuring the security of
the users-drones communications.

Barka et al. [37] discuss a model in which each UAV that
forwards a packet adds a trust value to it. The BC miners
should choose whether to add a new transaction to the next
block or not according to the trust values added by the UAVs.
Another system by Xu et al. [269] utilizes the UAVs to support
the MEC servers. The authors propose a method for permitting
resources trading between the Edge servers and UAVs. In
this system, the UAVs consume the server resources and the
latter is compensated with a certain incentive such as digital
currency. The Edge servers act as the BC miners that execute
Proof of Work (PoW). A similar system by Luo et al. [163]
utilizes the drones to cache data from IoT devices and forward

by each user or group on the block transactions. The system
classiﬁes the drones’ users into groups, where each group has
its own BC. The nodes of each group select a forger node to
produce the BC blocks. The selection is managed by a set of
master controllers based on game theory. The BC is stored
within the user layer only.

Several research works present BC-based systems for 5G-
or 6G- UAV networks. Aloqaily et al. [21] propose a cloud
service, named Drones-as-a-Service, in which UAVs are used
on-demand to deliver a high QoS connection to users in
areas where cellular base stations cannot offer the required
QoS. A user who desires to utilize the services of a certain
drone is given access to the drone keys in order for the user
and drone to communicate securely. A model for anonymous
authorization in IoD was proposed in [24]. The model conceals
the identities of UAVs inside the network packets and permits
only the receiver to deduce the ID of the sender. In this
system, UAVs are lightweight BC nodes that save only the
header part of the BC blocks. A zone-based architecture that
utilizes a tailored consensus algorithm, named the Drone-based
Delegated Proof of Stake (DDPOS), was presented in [275].
In this framework, the smart city is partitioned into zones
where each zone can include several drones and a single drone
controller (DC). The BC is saved and supervised by the drone
controllers. Each DC certiﬁes the transactions within its zone
and authorizes the drones’ tasks during their missions in the
smart city.

Nguyen et al. [192] present a system in which drones are
grouped into clusters where each cluster contains a drone
leader. The latter is selected as one of the powerful drones in
the cluster. Drones in each cluster communicate with the leader
only, and the leaders collaborate with each other and with
the edge servers. Leaders gather, manage, and send important
information to the edge servers, and the latter use the RAFT
consensus algorithm to organize and store the BC. Unlike
the system in [192], Tan et al. [242] propose a model that
makes use of the cluster heads (CH) as BC miners. The cluster
drones save only the BC state, which includes the list of cluster
members. The system uses a lightweight election mechanism
to select the CH that produces each BC block. Singh et al.

[234] propose ODOB, a model in which an Aviation Authority
(AA) outlines the access rights of each node and makes
security-related resolutions. The authors propose that the BC
data should be decoupled from the BC. When producing the
hash of the previous block, only the block header is utilized
in the process. This technique makes the BC block modiﬁable
and permits adding new transactions to it when required. The
authors of [86] present two major changes to the IoD BC: ﬁrst,
they implement the Keccak lightweight cryptography hashing
to sign transactions and produce the Merkle hash. Second,
they insert into the block two new elements: the Policy List
and Reputation Tree, which specify the access rights and the
reputation of each drone.

The authors in [215] propose a ﬂight compliance system for
Drone Service Providers with two key goals: 1) predeﬁning the
ﬂight path of each drone according to the drone’s mission,
storing the path within the drone’s BC, and ensuring that
the path does not contain restricted or private areas, and 2)
monitoring each drone to ensure that it follows its ﬂight path
in order to avert accidents. A similar method is proposed
in [202]. Here, drone owners register their drones with a
UAV central authority. The latter provides UAV-as-a-Service to
customers through virtualization. The central authority outlines
the description of each service, generates a smart contract for
the consumer, and stores it in the BC. Liao et al. [152] present
the Proof-of-Security-Guarantee (PoSG) consensus algorithm,
which assigns a higher mining probability to drones with
superior security guarantees. In PoSG, a speciﬁed amount of
resources should be provided by a drone, and each resource
must satisfy a minimum threshold for the drone to join the
BC network.

Tables XXI and XXII summarize the papers that were
discussed in this section, while Table XXIII maps each paper
to the BITS security requirements that were stated in Section
IV-C.

6) Blockchain for Miscellaneous ITS Applications:
In
addition to the ﬁve main use cases that were discussed in
the previous subsections, several authors proposed BC-based
systems for speciﬁc applications. In this section, we discuss
the most important miscellaneous applications of the BC in

transportation. Li et al. [143] propose a GPS positioning
error evolution sharing framework that utilizes the BC to
store and distribute the evolution of positioning errors. The
system enhances the vehicle positioning accuracy and ensures
the security and credibility of positioning data. The system
makes use of the edge servers that execute a deep neural
network (DNN) prediction algorithm to obtain the positioning
error evolution. The authors in [33] present the concept of
tradable mobility permit (TMP) to reduce trafﬁc congestion.
trafﬁc authorities utilize the blockchain to
In this model,

issue a limited number of mobility credits that are distributed
equally among the users. The latter can exchange and trade the
mobility permits based on their travel needs. Users can also use
the TMPs for transport-related payments such as toll payments,
parking fees, public transport tickets, etc. The authors utilize
Ethereum smart contracts to test the trading of TMPs in the
conducted simulations.

the authors propose a mixture

to achieve the optimization of signal
light management. Yang et al. [273] propose a trafﬁc event
validation scheme based on blockchain. The authors introduce

Proof-of-Event as a new consensus mechanism to conﬁrm the
event occurrences and detect false warning messages. The
trafﬁc data are collected by the RSUs, and each passing vehicle
validates the correctness of the trafﬁc data at the RSU when it
receives the event notiﬁcation. Moreover, the BC transactions
are divided into two consecutive stages, ﬁrst synchronizing the
local blockchain then the global blockchain. This enables the
delivery of warning messages in the correct region and time.

Deng and Gao [64] propose two electronic payment
schemes based on the BC. The members involved in a
transaction could be a vehicle and a single RSU (V-R
transaction); such as in the park toll management system,
or a vehicle and multiple RSUs (V-Rs transaction); such
as in electronic toll collection. The authors in [50] adopt

two main types of participants: 1)

The BC is used to implement Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS)
by the authors in [193]. The blockchain-based MaaS consists
of
the transportation
providers who act as BC miners and manage and maintain the
BC, and 2) travelers or clients who receive routes’ information
from the providers to create their own route as a smart
contract (based on their travel preferences). Once receiving
the smart contract of a client, providers collaborate to verify
and conﬁrm the smart contract before adding it to the next
block. A model for enhancing road safety by integrating
the IoT and BC was proposed in [209]. The system utilizes
the hashgraph technology to create communication networks
between the various types of vehicles in the network and other
relevant nodes such as the RSUs and cellular base stations.
The proposed system has the ﬂexibility of selecting the order
and speed of the transactions, postponing them, or stopping

them from reaching the block. A timestamp consensus is used
in hashgraph to prevent nodes from changing the order of
transactions, which is a major issue faced by the IoT and
blockchain. The authors describe various consensus models
that can be used with hashgraph, such as the Gossip protocol,
virtual voting, and round creation.

From our study of a large number of BC-based systems
transportation, we observe
for
the important
the BC plays in securing the
data, communications, and operations of the ITS. The BC
has been utilized in a large number of ITS applications,
including vehicles’ and drones’ network security, ride-sharing
and ride-hailing, smart parking, trafﬁc light system, electric
vehicles’ charging, etc. However, several challenges still exist
in the BC integration into ITS. We describe the important ones
below, highlighting the future research possibilities stemming
from these challenges:

• Data availability: among the large number of studied
papers, very few took data availability into consideration,
and fewer papers proposed reliable solutions to ensure
that ITS data in the BC will be sufﬁciently available
to all
ITS participants. With the highly demanding
computations and cryptographic operations of the BC, it
becomes quite a challenge to satisfy the time demands
of ITS participants related to storing, retrieving, and
analysing the BC data.

• Computational overhead: The BC operations demand
heavy processing and communications
to validate
and reach
the BC blocks,
transactions, generate
consensus. In a highly dynamic environment such as
that of the ITS, it becomes a challenge to ensure that
mobile nodes with limited resources can perform the BC
operations reliably and efﬁciently. This is true taking
into consideration the ITS characteristics, such as high
mobility, intermittent connectivity, and limited resources.
A wide-scale real testing of the BC within the vehicular
and UAV networks is still missing in order to study these
issues.

• Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Several research works attempted
integrating the BC with A.I. models to improve the ITS
applications’ performance and reliability. An example
of such integration is federated learning that focuses
on mobile nodes’ collaboration while implementing the
machine learning algorithm. However, much of
this
domain hasn’t been explored yet, and a lot of promising
progress in the ITS can be expected from future systems
that exploit the beneﬁts of the BC and A.I. together.
• Scalability: Similar to data availability, very few systems
attempted testing the BC in ITS while scaling the network

to a realistic level
networks in urban environments. It is still questionable
how the BC will perform in a real city scenario where
tens of thousands of vehicles communicate with hundreds
of RSUs and cloud nodes to execute the ITS applications.

that resembles real

These indicators urge us to develop a new vision for the
agriculture summarized as the agriculture 4.0. Agriculture
4.0 focuses on the precision agriculture while using new
technologies like the internet of things (IoT), the big data as
well as blockchain to bring greater business efﬁciencies to face
the rising populations and climate change [199].

A. Existing Surveys about Blockchain for Smart Agriculture

Table XXVI reviews some recent surveys dealing with the

use of blockchain technology in the agriculture ﬁeld.

B. Beneﬁts of Blockchain Technology in Smart Agriculture

Blockchain technology has many beneﬁts with respect to its

application in the agricultural sector:

1) Trusted data availability: as a trusted means of
storing data, it facilitates the exploitation of data-driven
technologies to make farming activities smarter. It even
promotes the agricultural research which relies on big
part on the data sharing between researchers.

2) Fraud prevention: as it allows the tracking of the
provenance of food and crops, blockchain technology
builds trust between producers and consumers and
avoids counterfeiting.

3) Financial

transactions efﬁciency and security:

it
facilitates ﬁnancial transactions between stakeholders by
means of smart contracts that can be triggered upon the
update of the data appearing in the ledger.

V. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SMART AGRICULTURE

The report called ”Agriculture 4.0 – The Future Of Farming
launched by the World Government
Technology” [169],
Summit, claims the urgency to modernize the agriculture
activity. The report states that, by 2050 we will need to
produce 70% more food, an ambitious number which is
very far from the current state. Indeed, 8% of the world
population will still suffer from undernourishment by 2030.

4) Cost and time reduction: it reduces costs and saves
time. The most
representative example here is the
insurance industry where checking claims (e.g damage)
is time and effort consuming. However, smart contracts
provide an automatic way that avoids
the heavy
administrative procedures.

5) Data security: blockchain technology is able to increase
the decentralized public
data security. For example,
ledger stores time-stamped transactions relative to lands

C. Agriculture Applications Requirements

We

identify

the

following

requirements

for

smart

agriculture.

1) Auditability/Traceability of products is essential for

tracking crops provenance for instance.

2) Availability: sharing data in a permanent way is a
requirement for some agriculture applications like land
ownership validation.

3) Securing data: stored data are more or less sensitive.
For sensitive data, it is necessary to protect them from
malicious access.

4) Integrity: must be guaranteed to prevent and detect
malicious modiﬁcations of data. To achieve this integrity,
users must be authenticated,
their access must be
controlled, and their privacy must be protected.

5) Trust is necessary when we speak about e-commerce

for agriculture products for instance.

From these different
requirements, we deduce that old
management methods and technologies are not always relevant
to make smart agricultural services. In the next section, we
argue about the role of the blockchain technology in this
evolution.

D. Blockchain for Smart Agriculture Use Cases

From our study, we can synthesise the state of the art
solutions and classify them into the following four categories
as illustrated in Figure 5:

1) Supervision and management including the food supply
chain, data sharing (for traceability or research) and
supervising the workers contracts.
2) E-commerce for agricultural products.
3) Resource management and environment awareness like

managing water resources and collecting wastes.

4) Land registration and agricultural insurance.
In the following we detail these categories.
1) Supervision and Management: By providing secure data,
blockchain technology is able to strengthen the supervision

of agricultural products quality and facilitate the cooperative
agricultural work. First of all, as previously highlighted in
Section VI, food supply chain can be efﬁciently supervised
through blockchain [108, 281, 176]. Blockchain enables both
consumers and farmers to track agricultural crops, livestock
and machinery. This will
increase consumers’ as well as
stakeholders’ trust in the agricultural products. This ensures
food safety and reduces food fraud. There are many projects
along with platforms that are based on the use of
the
blockchain technology like Provenance [211], Agridigital [10,
268], IBM Blockchain [105] and Carrefour [4].

research beneﬁts

Agricultural

Blockchain is a means of protecting agriculture workers by
supervising their contracts or temporary agreements. It is the
aim of [26] which proposed a model for assisting employers
in the contract processing, and for ensuring the respect of
the contracts (fair and legal remuneration). Many companies
have already started to apply this strategy like CoCaCola and
Unilever [43].

2) E-commerce for Agricultural Products: In this category,
blockchain technology is a means of securing ﬁnancial
transactions by means of solid key-based authentication
mechanisms. It also constitutes a digital payment solution
without rates. Furthermore, cryptocurrency based transactions
will reduce costs more substantially, increase transparency and
gain easier access to global markets.

As examples, we can cite the Spanish platform OlivaCoin
which is a platform for the trade of olive oil [20]. Similarly, the
platform [10] ensures the transfer of ﬁnancial transactions and
virtual currency between consumers and farmers. FTSCON
[66] is a food trade system with a consortium Ethereum
blockchain. It includes 300 agri-food enterprises in Shandong
(China). Foodcoin [83] is a new blockchain ecosystem for
creating a food and agricultural products global marketplace.
It
is based on the use of Ethereum smart contracts. The
food deals are triggered by smart contracts, while transactions
employ a proper cryptocurrency named FoodCoin.

3) Resources Management and Environment Awareness:
The proper management and use of agricultural ﬁelds, water

resources and soils is very crucial. Blockchain is useful
in this regard as it allows tracing this information for the
public. For instance, the automatic rationale is that watering is
necessary for areas that are known for their severe hot weather.
Additionally, common people do not have much knowledge on
how to grow plants in an appropriate way [187]. Following
this direction, [157, 71] focus on the use of the blockchain
in smart irrigation systems. In particular, [157], a blockchain
model is proposed for monitoring water distribution for a
set of smart farms. Mainly,
the blockchain technology is
used to store and share, in efﬁcient ways, data like water
quality, energy used, weather conditions, etc. [71] focuses on
smart irrigation system using photovoltaic energy generation
systems. Blockchain technology and smart contracts are
used to manage the energy trading using the SolarCoin
cryptocurrency. The paper presents a prototype to showcase
the proposed architecture. [44] addresses water scarcity and
water distribution transparency issues in rural areas. For
this, the authors propose blockchain technologies to provide
trust among community members and to coordinate the use
of water. Smart contracts are exploited to enable irrigation
execution. This paper provides a ﬁrst implementation of the
proposed architecture based on Ethereum and some sensing
devices (soil and water monitoring, etc). [187] proposes a
Smart Watering System (SWS) for smart water consumption
in small and medium-scale gardens and ﬁelds. SWS is based
on: i) sensors to provide real-time measures about plants and
environmental conditions like soil moisture and temperature,
ii) fuzzy logic to take decisions about watering schedule based
on sensors information, iii) blockchain to provide security by
allowing only the trusted IoT devices to access and manage
the proposed SWS. Also, a mobile application is developed to
enable humans to monitor the watering process.

Blockchain has also been used as a backbone infrastructure
for waste management. In [124], Plastic Bank employs a
blockchain based token to enable the collection and recycling
of plastic waste to clean up agricultural lands. [286] proposes
a blockchain based-model for collecting agricultural waste.
This waste is then converted to clean energy and agricultural
by-products like fertilizer, and animal feedstock. The waste
trade is based on a digital coupon or cryptocurrency. As
examples of commercial solutions for waste management, we

can cite: Recereum [220] and Swachhcoin [240].

4) Land Registration

and Agricultural

Insurance:

impact

Blockchain could also help for securing farmers against
weather conditions or natural disasters that
their
crops. Blockchain is then used in the insurance programs
especially via employing the smart contracts which are able
to automate insurance policies and thus reduce administrative
management [16]. Indeed, in insurance companies, processing
and verifying claims is known to be a long process. This
does not encourage farmers to establish insurance contracts.
Meanwhile, the removal of risk through insurance can increase
smallholder investment and income. The project ARBOL [29]
is an example that allows farmers to receive payments in case
of droughts, ﬂoods, etc.

Blockchain technology has also been used as a means
of
land registration and ownership management. Current
classical systems do not track the whole chain. Information
is fragmented in multiple ofﬁces of the government. These
ofﬁces are not sufﬁciently synchronized and corrupted people
can modify legal documents. About (70–80%) of worldwide
land transactions are not formally registered in any national
platform [247]. Also,
in many countries, hundreds of
thousands of civil cases take place every year concerning
is why blockchain technology has
land ownership. That
been adopted to create a trust atmosphere where property
information is shared in a transparent and secure way. Many
countries start using blockchain in land registration like
Sweden [51], Bangladesh [15] (a prototype system using
Ethereum and smart contracts) and Ghana [210].

E. Future Directions

From our study, we can conclude that there are many efforts
on applying the blockchain in the agriculture ﬁeld (e.g various
applications, commercial solutions). However, we believe that
there are still many things to do.

• Infrastructure

issues: The use of

the blockchain
technology in smart agriculture requires that rural areas
be equipped with networking infrastructure like for
instance 4G/5G stations. This is also required for
applications that integrate IoT devices or for agricultural
e-commerce applications in under development areas.

• Technical challenges: Scalability is a real

issue in
blockchain networks. The size of the blockchain grows
in proportion to the number of nodes and thus the
number of transactions. For an agriculture application,
transactions could be generated continuously, the ledger
size tends to grow rapidly. This limits the performance of
the platform in terms of transaction download time and
mining memory space as conﬁrmed by [247]. Consensus
algorithms complexity is also a limiting feature for real
implementations as it requires many energy resources and
processing time. Applying them for low capacity peers
like IoT devices is very challenging. For instance, the
Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus approach does not ﬁt
the IoT environment as it requires both computing power
and electric energy to a great extent.

• Incentives and regulations: We believe that

research is

required on the incentives

further
that could

be provided to the involved entities to integrate a
blockchain ecosystem. Working on policies, governance
to attract more
and regulation rules are fundamental
stakeholders and even small
farmers [120]. Also, a
concrete involvement of stakeholders is required to
promote commercial solutions.

VI. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

A. What Does Supply Chain Management (SCM) Mean?

(SCM)

in the literature [239, 213]. Some
common keywords found in the literature are: planning,
logistics, manufacturing operations, network,
activities,
collaboration,
suppliers,
intermediaries, raw material, costumer, etc. The reader
can refer, for instance, to the deﬁnition of the Council of
Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) [239].

coordination,

integration,

For us, based on the above cited references, we can

synthesize the following deﬁnition:

A supply chain is a network of individuals, organizations,
businesses, resources as well as technologies that combine
together and perform activities related to the manufacturing
of a product or service. The management of the ﬂow of goods,
services, and information involving the storage and movement
of raw materials, building products as well as ﬁnished goods
from one point
to another is referred to as supply chain
management. It implies processes coordination and activities
that involve services such as marketing, sales, design, ﬁnance
and information technology.

B. Existing Surveys about Blockchain for Supply Chain
Management

This section sheds some light on existing surveys dealing
in Table

with SCM. Readers can refer to these surveys,
XXVIII, for more detailed information on the topic.

C. Beneﬁts of Blockchain in SCM

Let us recall the most distinctive features of blockchain that

make it highly applicable for the SCM security:

requirement

is a major

to secure
supply chains, especially for sensitive products like
medicines and drugs. Traditional tracking methods range
from wireless sensors, Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation
Devices (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC),
Barcode readers, secure tags, ﬁrm speciﬁc traceability
mechanisms, etc (see for instance [246, 60]). However,
barcodes can be damaged or unreadable because of
environmental factors like moisture and temperature
variations. Also, though RFID is small and compatible
with many products,
it may be very expensive for
stakeholders [222]. Data provided by such means are
either tracked manually, or digitally stored in databases
prone to failures and security threats. Besides, tracing
some information when needed may take a long time.
Surely, tracking devices should continue to be used in
the SCs to identify products, machines, etc., but the

the authentication procedures required for ledger access,
the blockchain technology provides a means to store and
share data securely.

2) SCM time and cost reduction: monitoring supply
chains is complex and costly as it involves many entities
and hugely depends on the type of industry itself. When
a distributed system is used, costly transactions are
avoided by eliminating the need for intermediaries. Also,
a blockchain can make faster and simpler tracking items
and transactions in the supply chain by an estimated 85%
when used in conjunction with IoT technology, cutting
administrative and logistic timelines in shipping [23].

the origin, whether the food is organic or non-GMO

E. Blockchain for SCM Use Cases

1) SCM in Food Industry: One of

targeted
applications of blockchain regarding the SCM is the food
industry. This is due to the following features:

the most

1) Food products have more sensitive and vulnerable
supply chains compared to other
industries [115].
Indeed, food has changing quality that could be highly
impacted by outer conditions such as temperature and
transport.

2) Food security is fundamental, and requires a high degree
of accuracy and efﬁciency. Indeed, in case of supply
chain problems, consequences are very dangerous [190]:
products failure or counterfeit,
food poisoning and
disease, low quality food, or mislabelling and undeclared
ingredients after production.

3) Consumers are more and more requiring awareness
of what they eat (origin, ingredients, and so on). It
is necessary for stakeholders to present food quality
guarantees for their consumers to drive out competitors.
Blockchain is able to secure the food supply chains by
transparently tacking food. People will have equal chances to
access food data. Indeed, authorities and food companies tend
to share only selective data with the public (e.g Halal food
[168]). Information credibility might be questionable due to
marketing purposes, or when companies want to escape from
taking the responsibility in case of problems [176]. Besides,
solutions integrating blockchain with IoT devices allow real
time information updates which enables the involved entities
to monitor the supply chain efﬁciently (act immediately in case
shipping conditions are not respected). Finally, blockchain can
reduce food waste. Indeed, by having accurate and immutable
information about food consumption, stakeholders can forecast
the market needs and manage the production efﬁciently.

As previously cited, blockchain and IoT ﬁt well for food
SCM applications. It is the case for instance in [108, 281,
176] which integrates IoT with blockchain in order to track
the food chain. In particular, [108] focuses on monitoring
the temperature of ﬁsh using IoT devices interacting with an
Ethereum-based blockchain. In the proposed architecture, each
IoT device has its own gateway device and can communicate
with a close RPC server which allows it to interact with
the blockchain via its Web3 Ethereum API. Like that, IoT
devices can for instance access the information stored in the
chain or launch smart contracts. The gateway has a network
identiﬁcation and signs the transaction, using its private-key,
in order to prevent
to the RPC server,
before sending it
transaction tampering. For the use case presented, an IoT
device is installed into a refrigerator, connected to the Internet
through a mobile network connection, and monitors the fridge
temperature and truck position using a temperature sensor and
a GPS module, respectively. Moreover, the simulation has been
carried out using the Quadrans blockchain [61].

fuzzy food quality evaluation module (to evaluate the
food quality based on collected data), and the blockchain
management module. For consensus, the authors propose the
PoSCS algorithm that is developed to select validators who
are the stakeholders (instead of miners) in a probabilistic way.
This algorithm considers transit time, stakeholder analysis,
instead of
and shipment volume in the supply chains,
computational power and wealth. A case study was conducted
in a retail e-commerce company. However, the architecture
relies on a cloud server, which makes the system a bit
centralized and prevents data from being authenticated inside
the cloud.

Authors in [176] present AgriBlockIoT, a decentralized
traceability system for the Agri-Food SCM. AgriBlockIoT
is organized in layers and provides a REST API interface
for authorized users. Unlike [108], this paper relies on full
blockchain nodes which results in scalability issues. The data
storage relies on the cloud. The authors present a practical
farm-to-fork use case where the information provided ranges
from raw material to consuming details. The development
supports both Ethereum and Hyperledger Sawtooth. However,
the use of IoT devices was not practically implemented; it is
only simulated.

The paper [127] focuses on soybean SC and proposes
a solution based on Ethereum smart contracts. The authors
present a description of the smart contracts to perform business
transactions and to restrict access to some users when needed.
All transactions are stored in the blockchain ledger with links
to a decentralized ﬁle system (IPFS).

Many papers discuss the potential of blockchain in the
food industry using different methodologies. For instance, the
references [291, 276] base their evaluation on an analytical
model and by systematic review consolidated by companies’
interviews respectively. Among its ﬁnding, the paper [291]
conﬁrms that when the traceability awareness of consumers

is high,

[276] witnesses the suitability of
blockchain technology in the era of food supply chain in
industry 4.0.

the supply chain should adopt

Both [222, 281] consider that the challenge for the food
industry is to provide consumers with high quality food to
have a superior business advantage. For this, they propose a
blockchain based prototype for food quality indicator (FQI)
based on fuzzy logic and a developed model respectively.
In particular, [222] targets the pork restaurants and bases
the FQI computation on three major quality parameters:
Refrigeration/storage time, product shelf life and nutritional
value. This computation takes into account standard storage
and handling regulations speciﬁed by food safety authorities.
The authors ﬁnd that the storage conditions of pork meat are
the major element for its quality indicator. In this paper, a
particular package is traced by using unique identiﬁers like
barcode, RFID transmitter or QR code. The paper assumes
that such data is available and base their model validation on
it.

[281] proposes a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability
system (BIFTS) which is based on three modules architecture:
IoT monitoring module (devices, connectivity, application),

[62] proposes a solution for the agricultural products’
traceability in India. The solution is developed based on
Ethereum smart contracts. Like in [127], all of the transactions

are recorded and stored in a centralized interplanetary ﬁle
system database (IPFS). The proposed solution shows a
throughput of 161 transactions per second with a convergence
time of 4.82 seconds.

Although the blockchain technology is relatively young,
there are serious industrial efforts in the food market
to
produce real applications [276]. We can cite for instance the
project in [180] which focused on tuna ﬁsh tracking using
QR codes or RFID tags. IBM is investigating in this sector
with others partners. [111] is based on a big consortium
(IBM, Walmart, Nestle and Unilever) where food security is
the major challenge. With Maersk, IBM has also a project
to use Blockchain in order to make digital trade workﬂows
and end-to-end shipments [103, 194]. Carrefour also has a
famous application launched in 2018 [4, 47] to monitor some
products through the whole supply chain. Initially the solution
was tested with chickens, then deployed with other products
like milk, tomatoes and eggs. And, for this big company, the
objective is to apply this technology to all food products by
2022.

2) SCM in Other Industries: Blockchain technology has
also been applied to monitor the SC in other domains [101,
233] like drugs [1], textile [155], energy trading [151], wood
[82], etc. Table XXX highlights some of recent solutions in
these different domains.

Li et al. [151] proposed a consortium blockchain-based
secure energy trading system for Industrial IoT (IIoT). In the
proposed architecture, the electricity traded is computed by
a smart meter. Energy nodes form the network (e.g smart
building) while energy aggregators work as brokers to facilitate
transactions they receive from the server. Furthermore, each
node has a smart wallet to store its coins.

Because medicines are very sensitive products and are prone
to counterfeiting, blockchain technology has been used to
secure the drug or vaccine supply chain like in [1]. Section
III-D4 from the Healthcare part of this paper focuses on the
medical supply chain as it is a form of applying blockchain
in the medical sector.

The textile domain has been a focus of many works.
the supply chain in the textile and clothing
Indeed,
industries is complex and fragmented [155], and it involves
numerous actors from very different sources and operations.
Also,
there is not a standard path for garments: e.g:
clothes went through different processes each can be in a
different country. Usually papers divide the textile related
activities/information that need to be tracked into primary
and secondary [139, 155]. The primary one is related
to logistics (operations, sales, receiving, collecting, storing,
disseminating products), while the secondary one includes
human resource management,
technological development,
accounting, planning, etc. References [245, 155, 166] discuss
the advantages of blockchain technology focusing mainly
on the textile traceability. The chapter [245] consolidates
its discussion with a case study dealing with cotton ﬁber.
The paper [155] proposes a framework for ready-to-wear
clothing SCM. Considering a women’s shirt company use case,
the authors describe different components of the blockchain
solution: structure of blocks, how blocks are hashed together,

40

how data is retrieved by participants (RFID, NFC, QR
code, etc), etc. However, the paper does not provide a real
development of the proposal, the authors only focus on the
distributed ledger and how it could answer the challenges.

In [166], the authors propose a blockchain-based framework
to detect defective batches. The objective is to mainly
transporters,
enhance transparency. Actors include farms,
factories, retailers and consumers. The transactions identify the
processes and machinery used and manufacturers record the
purchase of a certain batch of material. Also, manufacturing
machines are equipped with sensors that communicate the
measurements to the blockchain and ensure remote control.
Like that,
the framework allows the machine to use the
information shared in order to automatically stop processing
the material and require human intervention. Authors focus
on products quality, and show how shared information can
enable real time detection of defective products. Also, using
simulations, they measure the quality impact (as a function
of blockchain information and all available information) and
show that missing information leads to quality degradation.
However, the paper only provides a very vague description,
no practical details about blocks structure, nor cryptographic
procedures are given.

Blockchain technology has also been proposed as a solution
to secure the aircraft supply chain in [54, 248, 165]. In
the IATA (The International Air Transport Association) study
”Future of
the Airline Industry 2035” [104], blockchain
technology has been identiﬁed as a technology that may have
a great impact on the future of aviation. Many recent projects
have already adopted this technology in their aviation services.
For instance, the Hainan Airlines (HNA) group implemented a
blockchain-enabled E-commerce platform[278]. Other projects
are also described in [217]. [54] uses the blockchain to build a
”digital twin” for the metal additive manufacturing of aircrafts
(manufacturing processes starting from a 3D model). A digital
twin of an aircraft can be deﬁned as a collection of digital
data representing this physical aircraft. The advantages are:
the traceability of the process, compliance with standards
regulations, control of the authenticity and quality, as well
as safety conditions of the components installed on every
airplane. The paper explains conceptually, how blockchain can
be applied during the different steps of the manufacturing
process. This conceptual explanation was strengthened via a
case study showing design information, block creation and
hash veriﬁcation.

[248] approaches the aircraft industry from another angle.
The authors address the risk analysis of the global supply
chain using the mean-variance method. They consider that
the blockchain is able to facilitate the use of information
for enhanced air logistics operations (e.g forecasting for
demand and supply, enhanced revenue management) and better
assessment of risk sensitivity by examining previous decisions
and transactions.

In [165], the authors focus on the aviation industry and
highlight
the beneﬁts of blockchain. They illustrate their
thoughts by sketching the process of acquiring and assembling
parts for air-crafts using a blockchain.

Blockchain-based framework for the aviation industry based
on smart contracts. Also, the paper presents ﬁve case studies
using the blockchain in the aviation industry.

Although there are few works focusing on the application of
blockchain in engineering management, there are some works
that discuss the potential of this technology to revolutionize the
supply chain of this sector [119, 58, 249, 252]. This discussion
is either conceptual like in [252], or via case more scientiﬁc
approaches. For instance, [58] applies a case study and reveals
a potential cost reduction from blockchain deployment at
8.3%. Also, [252] gives some keys to using a maturity model
approach to evaluate the blockchain role.

F. Future Directions

The state of the art in food supply chain management is
abundant. It
includes conceptual/theoretical papers as well
as papers with development, Proof of Concepts (PoC) or
prototypes. A large number of these papers end by discussing
the future challenges of the blockchain technology. We believe
that some challenges need to be addressed like:

• Performance enhancement: The current research effort
on blockchain for the supply chain is not yet on the

performance evaluation of the proposals. It is rather put
on the potential business use cases. However, blockchain
adoption in supply chain management implies technical
challenges like scalability, consensus complexity, and the
ledger size [247]. We need to observe and evaluate real
performance under real conditions in big supply chains.
• Interoperability and integration with other systems: The
supply chains, mainly the food supply chains, are
complex and involve many stakeholders. Each one of
these involved entities uses its own tools for traceability.
Thus, blockchain platforms need to integrate into these
existing systems such as warehousing management and
manufacturing execution systems, and enterprise resource
planning [267]. For instance,
the food supply chain
can be distributed through large geographical areas,
even in different continents. This fact implies signiﬁcant
interoperability and deployment obstacles [63].

that

• Privacy: The reference [247] mentions many privacy
attacks
the blockchain technology can suffer
from, especially in the supply chain management ﬁeld.
The privacy issue is more challenging for sensitive
information like big companies commercial data. Thus, to
take advantage of the technology, special attention should
be given to security and in particular privacy issues.
• Standardization and regulation: There is a need to deploy
regulations, incentives and rules to attract more parties to

the supply chain management [120]. For instance, there is
a fundamental need to govern existing platforms. Another
issue that is limiting a more massive blockchain adoption
is the lack of standardization. Standards are required for
any technology to have a scalable adoption across the
globe [172].

In [89],

the authors provide a survey of blockchain
applications in microgrids. The authors focus on the projects
and different start-up approaches for microgrids. The authors
compare these approaches in terms of blockchain type,
consensus mechanism, hardware development, and open
source. In addition, technical background and concepts related
to the blockchain, and future directions are also discussed.

VII. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SMART GRID

Blockchain has been applied in many smart grid
applications due to its beneﬁts such as decentralization, trust,
and improved security and privacy. Particularly, participants of
a smart grid can directly carry on a business trade (e.g., energy
trading) without the need of a third party or a centralized
organization such as an energy supplier. The blockchain-based
approaches for smart grid applications have been investigated
and presented in several surveys. Some of the most recent
surveys are presented as follows.

A. Existing Blockchain Surveys for Smart grid

In [185], the authors present a comprehensive survey of
blockchain for a smart grid. In the survey, the authors discuss
the security challenges of smart grid scenarios which can
be overcome by applying blockchain. The authors show
and analyze different related projects that apply blockchain
for smart grid applications. Finally,
the authors discuss
research questions, challenges, and future directions of
utilizing blockchain for solving security issues in smart grid
applications.

In [189], the authors present a survey of blockchain-based
smart grids. The authors discuss the advantages, challenges,
and approaches of applying blockchain to the smart grid. In
addition, the authors unveil how blockchain can be utilized
as the cyber-physical layer of the smart grid. Last but not
least, the authors provide industrial blockchain-based smart
grid applications and present the directions for future works.
In [35], the authors perform a survey of blockchain-based
approaches for energy sectors such as decentralized storage
and control in a power grid, peer-to-peer trading in smart grid,
and electrical vehicles. The authors discuss the requirements
of distributed energy systems (e.g., in a smart grid), which
are decentralization, anonymity, transparency, democracy, and
security. Finally, the potential applications of blockchain for
the energy sector and smart grids are also discussed.

In [294],

the authors perform a survey of blockchain
for cybersecurity in a smart grid. The survey covers
architecture
related to
and implementation techniques
blockchain applications that help deal with cybersecurity in
the smart grid. Finally, the survey discusses the potential future
research directions.

In [257], the authors present a survey of electrical power
systems utilizing blockchain for energy trading. The survey
classiﬁed the existing blockchain-based approaches for energy
trading into three categories based on their primary focus
including system optimization, consensus mechanism, and
energy transaction. The survey also presents the challenges
and unsolved problems in the existing approaches, and future
directions.

In these surveys,

issues of blockchain and
blockchain applications for the smart grid are mainly focused
whilst some of the requirements of smart grids such as
availability and autonomy are not considered. Although the
blockchain has many advantages that help improve the
quality of smart grid services, blockchain cannot overcome
all

the existing challenges and problems. Therefore,
survey analyzes the security requirements and other important
requirements of the smart grid. In addition, this section shows
the mapping between the blockchain technology/applications
and the requirements of the smart grid. Furthermore,

applying blockchain technologies. This helps to develop a

B. Security requirements of Smartgrid applications using
blockchain

Based on the previously cited surveys and requirements of
smart grid in the context of industry 4.0, we have identiﬁed
the requirements for a next generation smart grid application.
These requirements are presented as follows:

• R1: Conﬁdentiality:

including money transfer needs

Information such as business
transactions
to be
maintained conﬁdentially. Only partners who are involved
in the business transactions are eligible to access the
information. To deal with this, symmetric or asymmetric
cryptographic algorithms such as Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) or Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) can
be applied before inserting the data into the blockchain
as transactions.

• R2: Integrity: All of the records in the smart grid must
be original and not manipulated by any partner. Some
of the widely used methods for ensuring the integrity of
the records in a smart grid are applying time-stamps and
hash-function.

• R3: Authentication: is required in all the smart grid
applications. Authentication is the process of verifying
the credentials of a user or a participant. Some of the
authentication factors that are often used to verify the
user’s credentials are knowledge, possession, inherence,
location, and time factors [224]. The knowledge factors
are ”something you know” such as username, password,
and PIN. The possession factors are ”something you
have” such as a one-time-use token,
the one-time
password generated by a mobile app, or a smartcard.
Inherence factors are ”something you are” such as face
recognition, ﬁngerprints or other biometric identiﬁcation
forms.

• R4: Auditability: Public records and information related
to a smart grid are in the public domain which can be
publicly available and audited by any user or participant.
• R5: Authorization and Access Control: Only authorized
users can have permission to access speciﬁc resources.
Energy seller has full control of the energy generated by
their renewable systems.

• R6: Privacy: Customer or smart grid participant’s privacy
must be protected. Information of a customer or a smart
grid participant cannot be revealed without the concern
or acceptance of the person.

• R7: Trust: In the conventional systems, trust has been
built between energy sellers/buyers and the centralized
system. When selling energy to a centralized energy
company, energy sellers trust that the correct amount of
money will be transferred to their account. In the smart
grid, trust is not placed in the centralized system but is
distributed among the smart grid’s participants.

• R8: Transparency: In a smart grid, transactions, records,
events, and logs need to be transparent. Participants
should be able to track and check public information and

44

all the information related to the works or sections in
which they are involved.

• R9: Availability: Connections between the smart grid’s
participants must be ensured. Participants
such as
individual energy sellers should be able to connect to
both energy companies and also other individual users
such as speciﬁc energy buyers.

• R10: Automaticity: Business transactions between an
energy seller and an energy buyer should be done
automatically. For example, when an individual house
generates a particular amount of energy that exceeds the
energy usage, the surplus energy will be automatically
transferred to an energy company and the selling money
will be sent to the seller’s account.

C. Security
blockchain

solutions of Smartgrid applications using

The blockchain technology has found its way to many
smart grid applications. In most of these applications, energy
storage, energy distribution, and peer-to-peer energy trading
are focused. These factors are discussed as follows:

• Energy trading: Currently, centralized energy systems
have many disadvantages such as low level of fault
tolerance, lack of transparency, and energy inefﬁciency
caused by energy loss in long-distance transmission
and distribution [144]. Correspondingly, it can increase
these centralized energy
the energy cost. In addition,
systems may act as a single point of failure [191].
For instance, when the system has a problem in terms
of security, all consumer data can be leaked. Some
researchers proposed blockchain-based energy trading
approaches for overcoming some of the existing problems
of the centralized energy systems [287, 204, 140]. In
the proposed decentralized approaches, renewable energy
can be generated from wind or solar panels and is
locally stored in each participant’s house. When a
participant has more energy than needed, he/she can
sell it to other consumers. Each consumer can proceed
with peer-to-peer energy transactions without the need
for a centralized management system such as an energy
controller and supplier [191]. The approaches support
distributed transaction ledgers which are tracked and
managed by each consumer. Therefore, transparency and
privacy are provided. In these approaches, a user’s request
of dynamic pricing and energy requirements is validated
by a miner node [191]. In other words, the miner node
will add a transaction with a smart contract
into a
blockchain. When the predeﬁned conditions are met, the
smart contract will be automatically executed.

resources

• Renewable Energy: plays an essential role in energy
production. By utilizing natural
such as
sunlight; wind; and ocean waves, renewable energy can
be generated. Nowadays, renewable energy is generated
not only by large centralized factories but also by local
and individual houses. Particularly, a solar panel system
can be equipped at home for collecting energy from
sunlight. Depending on the location, an amount of the

collected energy can exceed the need of each house.
The surplus energy can be sold to a centralized energy
company or other houses. This causes the renewable
energy distribution networks to become more complex
[277]. Correspondingly,
the conventional centralized
energy distribution and control may not be suitable for
many cases. Therefore, a new type of energy distribution
grid that can deal with the complex renewable energy
distribution networks is required. The blockchain offers
distributed control and management which makes it a
suitable candidate for solving the existing problems of
conventional systems.

the development of a smart grid. A
component of
microgrid can be deﬁned as a small-scale power/energy
system with distributed energy resources
[227]. A
microgrid can be in one of four conditions which are

is in the island mode when the energy is
locally transferred between loads, decentralized energy
resources, and energy storage systems. The conventional
centralized system is not suitable for
these modes.
Therefore, Blockchain with distributed management and
control has been widely applied for the microgrid. Some
of the state-of-the-art approaches are shown as follows.

In [262], the authors presented an approach that utilizes
the blockchain for dealing with security issues in
peer-to-peer energy trading. The authors mentioned that
although the blockchain helps in solving some of the
existing problems of peer-to-peer energy trading,
the
blockchain trilemma still has some uncertainty such as
scalability, maintaining decentralization with an off-chain
transaction, and security aspects (such as the aspects
that blockchain handling overwhelms the network and
applying suitable protocols on the side-chain). Therefore,
the proposed approach utilizes both the blockchain and
second-layer solutions to enhance the quality of services
of peer-to-peer energy trading. The second layer
is
another blockchain which is an intermediary between a
decentralized app and the main chain. The second layer is
lightweight and can produce faster responses with lower
costs. Transactions are carried out on the second layer
instead of the main chain. When all the transactions are
successfully done on the side chain, the side chain and the
main chain are synchronized. One of the reasons causing
the side chain to have fast responses is that it has fewer
nodes. The proposed approach has been modeled by using
data captured from a trial case study. The result shows
that the proposed approach helps improve the scalability
without a negative impact on security.
In [72],
the authors present a decentralized platform
using blockchain for peer-to-peer energy trading. The

authors mentioned that
provide automation, a high level of
security, and
real-time settlements via the advantages of smart contract
implementation. The platform function was simulated
with several operations such as energy trading, market
clearing, smart contract operations, and blockchain-based
settlements.
In [121], a blockchain-based energy trading platform for
smart homes in a microgrid is introduced. The microgrid
platform based on a private blockchain network was
implemented by using Ethereum and smart contracts.
Each node of
the network is a smart home and
can be categorized into consumer and producer. Each
smart home has an energy storage system that can
store harvested energy and energy received from other
smart homes. The platform is secured, automated, and
decentralized. The authors implemented two nodes of
consumer and producer by using a client distributed by
Ethereum while a smart contract was implemented by
using solidity language.
In [201],
authors presented an auction-based
mechanism for peer-to-peer energy trading in a smart
grid. Particularly, the authors propose an optimized model
together with a sealed-bid auction that aims to achieve the
maximized proﬁt for peer-to-peer energy trading. Several
aspects such as transmission costs, buyers bid offering,
and operating costs had been considered in the model.
Two scenarios including peak time and non-peak time
trading were used to evaluate the proposed model. The
results show that the proposed model helps sellers achieve
maximized proﬁt while satisfying buyers.

Transactions of energy are safely stored in the blockchain
to avoid replication or tampering by other parties. The
proposed architecture includes a feature to mitigate
cyberattacks that target vulnerabilities of smart meters.
Although the proposed architecture has many beneﬁts,
the authors do not provide the necessary information to
build and implement it. In [100], the authors present a
method for efﬁcient energy trading via the utilization of
smart contracts. In the method, encourage-real-quotation
rules are applied to determine the trading parties
and energy price. The method guarantees that
the
trading information is secured, transparent and fair. The
proposed method is useful for small-scale transactions
in the energy trading market.
In [279], the authors present a strategy based on smart
contracts for reliable energy trading. The authors aim
to reduce the energy cost by shifting the demand of
users. Particularly, end users can buy energy from other
residential users via a blockchain network. The authors
present and deploy a demand response model to prove the
validity of the blockchain-based energy trading strategy.

for automatic trading when requirements are fulﬁlled. A

on the IBM platform using Hyperledger Composer. In
addition, the authors discuss the challenges in utilizing

Table XXXIII shows the mapping of

the previously
reviewed solutions to the speciﬁed smart grid requirements
described in subsection VII-B. It is noted that the complete
the
end-to-end application is analyzed. When a part of
application does not fulﬁll a speciﬁc requirement such as
privacy or conﬁdentiality, the whole application is considered
as a non-support of the requirement. In addition, when a
requirement is not mentioned in the discussed application,
the application is also considered as a non-support of the
requirement.

Currently, most public blockchain applications

lack
conﬁdentiality, data privacy, and data availability. To deal
with these problems, symmetric and asymmetric encryption
should be used whenever necessary. For example, energy data
should be encrypted before inserting into the blockchain. A
secret key for encryption and decryption can be distributed
off-chain during an initial key exchange. The secret key or
information needed to generate the key must not be shared on
the blockchain. Only participants who have the secret key can
access the information retrieved from the transactions. This
solution protects conﬁdentiality but it has some drawbacks.
For example, when using encryption, a key needs to be
shared off-chain. If the key management
is not properly
maintained, a private or secret key is disclosed and the
encryption mechanism completely fails. In addition, smart
contracts cannot interpret data without a secret key. This limits
the utility of smart contracts. Therefore, it is required that an
advanced approach for key sharing and management should
be developed to maintain a high level of security. It is noted
that the latency and energy consumption of each encryption
mechanism (e.g., AES256) are really small when compared
with the latency and energy consumption of data transmission.
Therefore, a decision of using an encrypted mechanism will
not mainly depend on these parameters. The decision relies
on the particular application in which some of the aspects can
have higher priorities.

(4)

The future smart grid needs to support

the following
aspects (1) allowing user categorization in which only
authorized users can access the information, (2) ensuring
integrity, (3) having fault-tolerant approaches that ensure data
availability and overcome network problems, (3) supporting
ﬂexible scalability,
supporting automaticity e.g., by
using smart contracts and other similar technologies, (5)
ensuring transparency and democracy among participants, (6)
supporting a hybrid approach that allows using encryption
when needed, (7) support advanced authentication approaches
to verify the users, (8) promoting trust between participants,
(9) supporting data privacy,
(10) having more efﬁcient
monitoring solutions, and (11) promoting ﬂexibility of feature
support. However, it is difﬁcult to support all the mentioned
features. Therefore, it is recommended that some requirements
should be categorized with a higher priority than others.
The solutions focus on the requirements with the highest
priorities ﬁrst. Then, requirements with lower priority can be
implemented as long as they do not conﬂict with the higher

VIII. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SMART HOMES

A. Smart Homes

Various research studies have attempted to outline a
deﬁnition of what a smart home is. Indeed, a smart home is an
ensemble of IoT devices interconnected via a network [200] to
manage home appliances while improving security and energy
consumption. IoT refers to the various connected devices
and physical objects including sensors, microcontrollers and
software components that allow their connections [74]. Daily
life is becoming basically dependent on these connected
devices which can be controlled remotely. The interconnection
between devices and real objects makes life easier and
those
helps in saving time and costs greatly. Moreover,
IoT devices might serve different purposes and uses at the
home, such as: Smart door lock system, Security home
system, Smart air conditioning, Lighting control system,
Energy management system, Appliance control system, Smart
thermostat, Smart bathroom appliance, Garage door opener,
Patient monitoring. The smart home is composed of different
modular functionalities that can be removed, or added upon
new options. It offers the advantage of creating different
scenarios depending on the equipment. All those applications
tend to make life at home comfortable and convenient. Thus,
many research studies are proposed for improving these
applications while preserving the security and privacy aspects.
Thus, designing a smart home requires usually the following
components[159]:
• Sensors:
the sensor nodes are used to monitor the
to change such as:
the parameters subject
state of
temperature, pressure,
..etc. These environmental or
physical parameters are meant to be perceived, collected
and processed with the network coverage by the
coordinates of each node.

• Sensors network: consists of multiple wired and wireless
networks. Its conﬁguration depends on the nodes. It
involves sensors, embedded computing, and wireless
communication.

• Wireless

technology:

communication

many
technologies can be used in this context. Each wireless
communication has some speciﬁc features related to the
parameters of this technology. Among these parameters
transmission
are network scalability, battery life,
rate, band,
integration and
reliability, and cost. Examples of those technologies are
Zigbee, WIFI, and mobile communication.

terminal equipment costs,

• Power line communication: the power lines used for

data and information transmission.

Furthermore, the modern production of home appliances
equips them with devices that enable their monitoring and their
control, which can be done remotely through dedicated control
systems. As a result, these devices become smart in a sense
of having the self-management capability to make decisions
on how to deal with different variations of the parameters
(for example, based on the temperature degree, setting the
air conditioner at a certain temperature and certain mode).

B. Smart Homes and Blockchain

Since the creation of the Bitcoin virtual currency,
the
blockchain (BC) technology has gained wide attention. This
technology has gained much interest and development because
of the ambitious security features that it offers. Many surveys
in the literature have studied the advantages of using BC
technology in smart city applications in general, and in smart
homes more speciﬁcally. The integration of BC in a smart
environment such as smart homes requires certain adaptations
[137], which leads to the necessity of highlighting some rules
that will be used as detailed in the list below:

• Transactions: are the communication of the different
interconnected devices
smart home. This
communication refers to various types such as storing,
monitoring, and accessing.

in the

• Local blockchain:

the local BC is used mainly to
track the transactions explained in the previous point.
Generally, the local BC is private, which allows the owner
of the home to set control policies. This latter through
a policy header manages the incoming and outgoing
transactions. The immutability of BC is preserved by
hashing the previous block in the block header, which
results in having two headers in each block: policy
header and block header. Finally,
linking the devices
transactions’ is made through the use of an immutable
ledger in BC.

• Home miner: a miner in the smart home context is the
device responsible for allowing and blocking incoming
and outgoing transactions to the home and from the home.
Thus, it authenticates, authorises and audits transactions.

Fig. 6: Smart home’s main components

This aspect of making decisions allows in many cases to
considerably reduces cost and save energy [99].

In addition, smart homes devices generate an immense
amount of data. This data is related to the home owner’s
sensitive information that must be well protected to prevent
cyber threats. Indeed, these threats in a digital environment
such as the smart home have been studied in many research
studies, such as denial of service, ransomware, identity theft,
information leakage, as pointed out and classiﬁed in [244],
[126], [18], [28], [70], [179]. These threats lead us to consider
the security of smart homes and how it should be ensured as
pointed out in [232], [153]. Thus, many approaches have been
proposed to ensure the security in smart homes, and among
these approaches is the blockchain.

It can be used as a stand-alone device or it can integrate
with the home’s internet gateway. The miner is the entity
responsible for handling all communications related to
the home.

• Local storage: the storage is necessary to complete the
miner work or to store data locally using a backup device
called local storage.

In the case of a smart home using BC technology, the scenario
goes as follows: ﬁrst, the initiation starts by adding devices.
In this case, the owner should update the latest blocks policy
header because the main objective of the policy header is
authorising devices. This authorisation is possible through the
miner which uses the policy header in the latest block in the

be realised by using direct communication between devices,
or by using external entities. Direct communication is ensured
using a shared key that needs to be allocated by the miner.

considering Blockchain technology to secure the smart home
environment [45]: the IoT devices connected to the smart
home are subject to a connection and disconnection, thus their
numbers might change. The necessity to tolerate and mitigate
cyberattacks on the smart home network. The IoT devices are
limited in terms of computing power and energy consumption.
Hence, there is a need for high performance while preserving
the privacy and security.

C. Blockchain for Smart Homes Existing Surveys

Many surveys dealing with blockchain-based smart home
solutions can be found in the literature. In the table XXXIV,
we summarised the most recent surveys, by mentioning their
advantages and their disadvantages.

The Authors in [200] have worked on a systematic literature
review. Their review dealt mainly with the blockchain as a
technology for IoT integration. In the so doing, they have
presented different applications areas. Then, they organised the
available literature review as per the selected areas. After that,
two main usage patterns were presented: device manipulation
and data management.

In [186], the authors have surveyed the latest trends in
using the blockchain technology in smart homes systems.
By discussing the various smart homes based blockchain
solutions. In this context, two case studies that show how
blockchain may empower smart homes transactions related to
are presented.

also explored the impact of integrating blockchain technology
with other new technologies such as machine learning. Also,
they proposed a framework of IoT security and privacy
requirements via blockchain.

the necessity of considering security challenges when dealing
with blockchain-based applications for smart homes. Besides,
the essential implementation requirements of blockchain in the
IoTs have been presented. Finally, a state-of-the-art framework
of IoT while adopting security features and decentralised
storage requirements of the blockchain.

Authors in [93] presented a comprehensive survey of
Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications. This
survey
focused mainly on potential application design, security and
privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on
Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. Also,
an in-depth analysis and a classiﬁcation of security and
privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance
the advancement of security features have been presented.
Furthermore, challenges of integrating BC into industrial
applications
that help design secure Blockchain-based
applications as future directions are presented.

D. Security Requirements of Smart Home Applications

Many requirements have been identiﬁed for ensuring a
secure smart home-based application, as pointed out in [3],
[141]. We identify such requirements as follows (RSSH
for requirements for secure smart home applications). As
discussed earlier in this part, a smart home is made up
mainly from the communication of multiple connected devices
that are controlled and monitored through a gateway. Such
communication is always exposed to many cyber threats
related to data leakage and privacy breaches.

Due to the heterogeneity of the connected devices in the
smart home, many difﬁculties are faced, especially in the
absence of security standards. For this reason, users of the
smart home cannot beneﬁt from different services. Thus,
security is one of the main concerns to be considered. The
following describes the security requirements for gateways in
smart homes:

• RSSH1: Authentication:

authentication

about
preventing an attacker from acting maliciously within a
normal network from outside the smart home network.
Thus, BC is used to ensure constantly that the network
is a valid member in order to enable necessary corrective
actions.

is

• RSSH2: Accessibility. this item refers to the ability of
granting access to only legible users of the smart home.
• RSSH3: Privacy and conﬁdentiality. these two aspects
deal with maintaining the conﬁdentiality of the data
generated within the smart home network. It is known that
the data generated is sensitive, thus the access to it should
be only by authorised entities. The use of symmetric key
encryption between different nodes to verify transactions
is one of the mechanisms used to ensure those aspects.
• RSSH4: Integrity: this item deal with preserving the
transmitted data sent or received within the smart home
network from any alteration or falsiﬁcation. . The hash
function is used to ensure this item, and it allows the
tracking and checking of precisely what data is recorded.

E. Requirements of Smart Home Applications to Adopt
Blockchain Technology

• Solution building and testing. This is related to the
software and hardware requirements. First, a suitable BC
platform has to be carefully chosen, (e.g., permissioned)
and its consensus algorithm. The best choice is usually
the private blockchain platform with its computationally
less expensive consensus protocol. Secondly, hardware
requirements have to be determined properly, in order to
be able to implement the prototype in the real smart home
environment. A performance matrix and Acceptance

Test Procedure (ATP) may assist to achieve the desired
blockchain platform.

• Rollout and integration. This is due to the necessity of
keeping both traditional systems and new BC systems.
The integration of both systems might
lead to a
non-suitable adaptation.

• Usability. ensuring a good user

interface and user
experience (UX UI) and a web-based dashboard to
facilitate the interaction between the system and the user.

F. Summary of Blockchain for Secure smart home solutions

In this section, we detail the most trending solutions related
to the use of blockchain in smart home environments for
security purposes. The categorisation of the solutions will be
according to: their main contribution to the blockchain, the
BC type used in the proposed solution, the consensus, the
storage, the validation tools, and the limits if available. In

TABLE XXXV: Beneﬁts of blockchain to Smart home Applications

Decentralization

Using blockchain technology IoT can move and promote from centralization to decentralization which
means a peer-to-peer distributed network structure that eliminates the exclusive of powerful company
controls over IoT data processing and storing. Furthermore, decentralization enables IoT scalability to
be improved [128], [188], [34], [154].

In blockchain technology, each participant (peer) can identify any other devices or participants (peers)
included in the distributed network of IoT, with immutable and unique identiﬁers for each peer. This
means that blockchain technology can provide IoT with high authentication and authorization distributed
peers for its applications [128].

Blockchain technology opens opportunities for shifting to the next generation features of IoT applications,
which will beneﬁt the participants of IoT applications [154].

Which is the feature that the blockchain can bring to the IoT that enables each peer to authenticate data
each time to detect if it is tampered with. In addition, it enables the traceability and accountability of
sensor data. [128].

Blockchain increases the security of the IoT through the validation of all transactions (data exchange)
by smart contracts, which will be optimised by the current IoT protocol [136].

of

Through the beneﬁts, that blockchain brings to IoT, the IoT services varieties and coverage will be
expanded rapidly in services and data economic ﬁelds, as well as decreasing the cost of centralization
model installation and maintenance [133].

use of decentralized, using gateway and Private/ Consortium
and Ethereum and Encryption method(Hash values and a
veriﬁcation process) and Cloud storage and Solidity and Smart
contracts and additional computational complexity by the BC
operations.

The work in [59] is about a suggested method that ensures
data privacy in a smart home using BC technology, called
smart home based on the IoT-Blockchain (SHIB). To validate
this proposed method, an experimental scenario was used
which includes Ganache, Remix, and web3.js has been built
among the user, service provider, and smart home to evaluate
the performance of the smart contract in the SHIB. One main
limitation of this work is that the additional computational
complexity of the blockchain operation is not studied.

Authors in [293] proposed an IoT architecture for the smart
home based BC and smart contract to improve efﬁciency,
storage and energy cost. The architecture is entailed over three
tiers: smart contract triggered by the IoT device in the smart
home if certain conditions are met, private BC in each smart
home, and public BC that connects various houses. In [271]
Private Blockchain-Based Secure Access Control for Smart
Home Systems Private (PBAC) has been proposed. Security
analysis and performance evaluation have been studied as well.
The authors in [183] focused their proposed work mainly
on energy consumption for the smart home. They suggested
an efﬁcient
integrated BC (ELIB) model for
IoT security and privacy. The proposed BC system is a
public one that was implemented using Hyperledger Fabric,
PBFT consensus, Cloud storage, and Hyperledger composer.
However,
the storage of patients data in the blockchain
network is heavy.

lightweight

In the same context of energy consumption, authors in [5]

proposed a BC enabled distributed demand side management
in a community energy system with smart homes public.
The proposed method has been developed using Hyperledger
this
Fabric PBFT and cloud storage. One limitation of
approach is that the storage of patients’ data in the blockchain
network is heavy.

is that

From the above table, we observe that most of the solutions
proposed for smart home applications use private BC instead
the public
of public BC. The reason behind that
BC presents many challenges related to high latency, full
openness, low usability, low throughput, and low scalability.
While private and consortium BCs have a trust-based model,
low decentralization, and fewer security issues. This issue may
hamper the adoption of BC in smart home. However, as the
new consensus algorithms and privacy-preserving techniques
are emerging, blockchain is expected to provide different levels
of decentralization with divergent access policies in a scalable
fashion to offer more reliable and secure smart environments.
Moreover, smart contracts can provide intelligence to the
BC for anomaly detection or execution of business logic for
enabling safe and reliable smart environment services.

G. Mapping of existing solutions to Security requirements and
Future Directions

In Table XXXVII, we present a mapping between the
solutions presented in Section VIII-F and the requirements
presented in VIII-D. This mapping aims at highlighting the
solutions presented as per the security requirements. One main
ﬁnding of this section is that integrity is not always veriﬁed
or checked in the presented works. This is a point to say that
adopting BC for smart homes cannot guarantee full security.
Integrating BC technology into the smart home enabled
solutions is motivated by many beneﬁts, among which security
is the top one. Yet, many challenges related to smart home

BC enabled were captured and studied. The author in [251]
has discussed the design challenges related to developing BC
capabilities for a smart home were studied in an experimental
setup. One of the main ﬁndings of this work pointed out
that the design practices of the BC systems still have a low

maturity level. Mainly because it is still lacking standards,
governance models and means for quantitative analyses. One
of the open issues related to the smart homes BC based
is the security challenges. Networks conﬁgured in smart
homes, collect and store multiple data, including sensitive

information from residents. The miner in the smart home
case is the entity responsible for handling all communications
related to the home. The authors in [186] have pointed out
that the impersonation attacks are one of the most critical
attacks for smart homes that need a lot of attention. Since
the efﬁciency and the speed of making sure that the nodes
involved in potential
of the smart home network are not
impersonation attacks. This is usually checked by consensus
among all mining nodes in the BC network. However, this
requires enormous computational power and hence we need
research on efﬁcient consensus algorithms that not only reduce
the computational power but also enhance the speed. Also, we
need to consider the overhead on the resources-constrained
IoT devices that are known to be lightweight devices that need
time to verify the transmitted data. The use of BC requires
transactions’ validation and insertion block time, which results
in responses delays. Thus, the traditional BC mechanism is not
suitable for time-sensitive smart home IoT applications, where
a minimum delay results in severe consequences. Besides,
there is the issue of interoperability that is due to the different
formats of data collected from various types of IoT devices.
This heterogeneity makes implementing the system quite
challenging. For example, the different consensus algorithms
adopted by BC systems have a huge impact on implementing
an interoperability protocol.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

This survey explores the use of blockchain in smart cities.
First, we start by reviewing existing surveys and we explain
the distinction and therefore the motivation of this survey.
Then we give an overview of blockchain. After that, we
reviewed blockchain based solutions for the main smart city
applications, namely smart healthcare, smart transportation,
smart agriculture, supply chain management, smart grid, and
smart homes. For each smart city application we ﬁrst reviewed
then we discussed the
the existing surveys of that area,
requirements and the beneﬁts of blockchain to this area. Then,
we discussed the blockchain based solutions and we conclude
by a mapping of the reviewed solutions to the speciﬁed
requirements and giving possible future directions. Although
several solutions have been developed around blockchain for
smart city applications, several challenges still need to be
resolved before the real deployment of such solutions. Storage,
throughput, scalability, and interoperability are some of the
main challenges facing blockchain-enabled solutions. These
challenges need to be carefully considered when proposing a
blockchain-based solution.
