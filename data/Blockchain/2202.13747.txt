Abstract: - One of the most important tasks in scientific publishing is the articles’ evaluation via the editorial 
board and the reviewers’ community. Additionally, in scientific publishing great concern exists regarding the 
peer-review process and how it can be further optimised to decrease the time from submission to the first decision, 
as well as increase the objectivity of the reviewers’ remarks ensuring that no bias or human error exists in the 
reviewing process. In order to address this issue, our article suggests a novice cloud framework for manuscript 
submission based on blockchain technology that further enhances the anonymity between authors and reviewers 
alike. Our method covers the whole spectrum of current submission systems capabilities, but it also provides a 
decentralised solution using open-source tools such as Java Spring that enhance the anonymity of the reviewing 
process.

1  Introduction 
In order to publish a scientific article, regardless of 
the  field,  the  typical  process  consists  of  either 
contacting 
journal  or  simply 
submitting  a  manuscript  via  a  web  platform. 
Afterward, the editorial board checks the submitted 
article  to  address  whether  it  is  within  the  scope 
following  author  guidelines.  Specifically,  the  board 
first validates that the content is original and that its 
subject is appropriate for publication in the submitted 
article. Second, it checks that the submitted document 
(usually in word or latex format) complies with the 
described  specifications  of  the  journal  in  terms  of 
font size, spacing, paragraphs/equations/figures, and 
numbering etc. Then, upon the editorial approval, the 
article is sent to a pool of available reviewers based 
on  its  content  and  their  expertise.  Last,  reviewers 
send a detailed report to the assigned editor with their 
comments and suggestions regarding the acceptance 
or rejection of the article. This report usually consists 
of  a  detailed  list  of  the  necessary  article  revisions 
from spotted typos, to sections that need to be 

rewritten for clarification, to general remarks on the 
logical flow of the text. 

The aforementioned process is the current status 
quo  in  academia  as  it  provides  an  independent  and 
fast way to assess an article, i.e. author submissions. 
Unfortunately, one of the problems with this method 
is that it does little to address what is referred to as 
“publication bias” [1]. Analytically, this term refers 
to the human factor in academic publishing, i.e. the 
reviewers who are tasked to act as referees and argue 
whether  an  article  shows  merit  or  else  provide  a 
detailed response of possible ways to ameliorate the 
articles’  current  form.  There  are  many  causes  for 
dissatisfaction 
from  over 
criticising  the  results  of  a  specific  section,  over 
addressing  issues  to  delay  a  competitive  research 
group, or simply the reviewers undergoing a stressful 
period and not providing valuable remarks. 

in  peer-reviewing 

Regardless of the reason, in   order  to  eliminate 
human bias, publishing companies have made great 
efforts  to  introduce  anonymity  when  an  article  is 
reviewed. More specifically, the authors  rarely know 
what  the reviewers’  names  are  and typically,

the  same  applies  to  the  reviewers.  In  the  next 
sections,  we  will  represent  the  types  of  peer- 
reviewing, however, the key point in peer-review is 
that in the last years emphasis has been given to total 
anonymity for both sides alike.

2  Aims and Objectives 
This article aims to introduce a scientific manuscript 
submission  platform,  similarly  with  [2],  [3],  [4] 
focusing on anonymity. Specifically, this article aims 
to 
cloud-based  privacy-focused 
decentralised  submissions  system  that  leverages 
blockchain  technology.  First,  we  provide  a  brief 
literature review on manuscript submission  solutions 
focusing on blockchain decentralised applications in 
education  and  academia.  Second,  we  explain  the 
different  types  of  peer-review  processes,  their  key 
differences,  and  the  problems  associated  with  the 
current  evaluation  criteria  in  scientific  publication. 
Third,  we  consider  how  blockchain  technology  is 
used in  a  number  of  real-case scenario  applications 
and  provide  key  points  regarding  its  architecture. 
Fourth,  we  present  a  novel  cloud-based  framework 
implementing  blockchain  architecture  for  academic 
article and conference proceedings for a cloud-based 
submission  system.  Last,  we  draw  conclusions  on 
how  to  change  the  current  status  quo  in  order  to 
increase the quality of peer-reviewing and reduce the 
reviewing time from submission to a final decision. 

The  objective  of  this  work  is  to  showcase  the 
software  design  architecture  of  our  middleware 
layers  and  present  in  detail  our  benchmark  results 
regarding  the  blockchain  implementation  of  our 
system.  Our  proposed  system  harnesses 
the 
advantages  of  blockchain  architecture  to  provide  a 
fast,  reliable,  and  anonymous  academic  submission 
system that further enhances the double-blind review 
process as well as provide more accurate reviewers’ 
suggestions. 

3  Related Work 
In recent years, manuscript submission systems  have 
been intensely studied in various scientific fields to 
explain  and  understand  different  existing  processes 
and publication procedures [5]. Specifically, current 
research trends focus on explaining the properties of 
the  used  platforms  as  well  as  providing  all  the 
necessary  author/article  affiliation 
information 
during  an  article  submission  [6].  In  this  study,  we 
have  examined  a  recent  bibliography  regarding  the 
pros and cons of the 

peer-review part of a system and its limitations  [7], 
[8].  Although  peer-review  is  considered  highly 
important  in  article  assessment  [9],  many  problems 
occur in terms of biases from reviewers and editors 
alike [10], [11], [12]. Researchers argue that a great 
deal  must  change  in  order  to  enhance  current 
procedures  as  mentioned  in  [13],  [14].  Moreover, 
emphasis  is  given  on  technical  aspects  of  peer- 
review  [15]  such  as  policymaking  processes  [16], 
enhancing  anonymity  over  transparency  [17],  and 
reliability and quality of peer-review [18]. 

One of the most interesting aspects in manuscript 
submission systems is arguably the human factor and 
how human assessment can be subjective and prone 
to  bias  [19].  The  latest  research  trends  have 
recommended new ways to eliminate human bias via 
the  use  of  AI  [20],  Big  Data  analysis  [21],  game 
theory  analysis  [22],  statistics  [23],  new  evaluation 
models  [24],  strategies  [25],  and  algorithms  [26]. 
Analytically, one of the most promising technologies 
regarding eliminating biases, promoting objectivity, 
and  anonymisation  in  peer-review  is  blockchain 
technology  [27],  [28].  This  technology  is  used  for 
various  reasons  such  as  detecting  plagiarism  [29], 
shared  governance  in  publishing  [30],  fairness 
evaluation  via  permission  checks  [31],  and  web-
based file-sharing systems [32]. 

Finally, it is noted that since blockchain promotes 
decentralised 
frameworks 
applications,  many 
leveraging  its  properties  in  academic  services  exist 
with  high  security  features  due  to  its  anonymous 
nature [33], [34], [35], [36]. Specifically, similarly to 
the  framework  presented  in  this  publication,  this 
paper  is  influenced  by  the    following  studies 
regarding “all batteries included” software solutions 
in  scientific  publication  submission  systems  [37], 
[38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. 

4  Background and System Properties 
Current  scholarly  publishing  consists  of 
the 
following stages [43], [44]: 

•  Registration: providing an official timestamp 

of submitted scientific results. 

•  Certification: peer-reviewing to access and 

validate scientific discoveries. 

•  Dissemination: distribution of discoveries to 

the academic community. 

•  Preservation: digital/physical storage of a 

publication or data(set). 

In this article, we provide a tool regarding the 
second stage of publishing, i.e. the certification.

This process consists of peer-reviewing. It is the only 
universally  accepted  method  for  validating  and 
accessing  the  quality  of  articles  and  conference 
proceedings. 

4.1  Peer-Review Process 
Peer-reviewing  of  academic  works  dates  back  to 
1731  by  the  Royal  Society  of  Edinburgh,  which 
adopted  an  editorial  procedure  for  a  collection  of 
peer-reviewed  medical  articles  and  subsequently 
became a norm after World War II [45]. “Reviewers” 
are  the  cornerstone  of  academic  evaluation  in 
communities as they act as experts in a field to -pro-
bono-  read,  understand,  access,  and  validate  the 
findings  of  their  peers.  Their  work  consists  of 
examining  a  publication  and  providing  valuable 
insights  to  an  editorial  board  that,  based  on  their 
opinion, decides to accept or reject a manuscript as 
well as provide suggestions to enhance the content. 

The  overall  peer-review  process  starts  when  an 
author submits an article to a journal or a conference 
for  publication.  The  editorial  board then assigns an 
editor who performs the initial screening of the text 
to  assess  whether  it  is  within  the  scope  of  the 
journal’s subjects, aims, and objectives. Later, if the 
editor  does  not  decide  that  the  publication  has 
scientific  value,  he/she  rejects  it  (desk  reject),  or 
otherwise,  he/she  contacts  reviewers  (typically  3-6 
persons)  to  provide  their  remarks  on  the  submitted 
publication. After that, when all the reviewers answer 
and provide their insights as well as suggestions for 
publication (accept/reject etc.), the editor takes all of 
their reports under consideration and provides them 
to the author(s). This is the final round of reviewing 
and it usually consists of communication between the 
author(s) and the reviewers where all their comments 
are addressed and the article is resubmitted, reread, 
and re- evaluated. 

Last, if reviewers state that no further actions are 
requested by the authors, the article is accepted and it 
is considered for publication. This process is briefly 
presented in Figure 1 [46]: 

Fig. 1: Diagram of Peer-Review process 

4.2  Peer-Review Types 
In  this  section,  we  explain  what  the  types  of  peer- 
reviewing  are  and  their  unique  characteristics. 
Analytically, peer-reviewing can be categorised into 
the following: 

•  Single-Blind: where the reviewer(s) identity is 

hidden from the author(s). 

•  Double-Blind:  where  both  the  author(s)  and 

the reviewer(s) identity remain hidden. 

•  Open:  where  both  the  author(s)  and  the 
reviewer(s) identity are known to all available 
parties. 

•  Transparent:  where  the  review(s)  are  posted 
alongside an article but the reviewer(s) retain 
the right to hide their identity. 

The cloud-based application and the algorithm we 
propose in the following sections focus on expanding 
the double-blind review category.

undoubtedly  blockchain  technology.  Blockchain  is 
simply a public ledger that keeps all the transactions 
of  its  users  in  a  validated  and  permanent  manner, 
without  the  need  for  a  centralised  authority  or 
intermediaries.  Blockchain  is  similar  to  databases. 
However, what makes blockchain different is the fact 
that the validation is a job of existing nodes and not 
of a central authority. 

Keywords of this DLT are nodes, miners, blocks, 
and cryptography, and in the following each one will 
be  explained  while  describing  the  procedure  of 
blockchain [47].

4.4  Blockchain Key Points 
Blockchain is a public ledger because all the nodes 
existing  in  it  are  always  of  equal  value  and 
importance  (p2p).  As  obvious  from  its  name, 
blockchain consists of x blocks in a chain. Each block 
consists of inputs (e.g. transactions) and when a block 
has  stored  the  required  amount  of  data  it  is  added 
automatically  to  the  chain  of  blocks.  From  the 
moment that a block is added to the chain, there is no 
chance  of  changing  the  data,  since  all  the  data  has 
been  distributed  to  all  the  nodes  [48].  This  makes 
blockchain technology decentralised and distributed 
meaning that this ledger is kept at the same time in 
the  same  way  by  all  its  nodes.  The  distribution  of 
every  new  input  to  the  ledger  and  the  addition  of 
every  new  input to  a  block  -  after  a  first  validation 
(checking the legitimacy of the inputs) - is the work 
of what are called miners. Miners are individuals who 
use advanced computing programs. Specifically, they 
are  rewarded  for  every  block  they  form  for  their 
services (i.e. computational processes) [49]. 

This ledger must be credible and trustworthy. It 
is clear that allowing certain individuals, meaning the 
miners, to add blocks to the ledger and get paid for 
every  block  they  add,  creates  conflict  of  interests. 
This is because every miner is motivated to execute 
the job in a fast and not so responsible way. Imagine 
the case where two miners find the same transaction 
and at the same time add to their own block the very 
same transaction. The danger of double-written and 
stored inputs means that the user, who is the debtor, 
would see that he/she has a debt double the size of the 
one agreed to be paid. 

the 

For  this  reason,  it  is  certainly  necessary  for  a 
consensus  protocol  that  clarifies  the  way  that  all 
proofs are validated and the way that every block is 
created  and  stored  in  the  system.  Analytically,  a 
consensus mechanism -which consists of a complex 
algorithmic process - is a set of rules that decides on 
the  contributions  by  various  participants  of  the 
two  most  common 
blockchain.  Moreover, 
algorithms  are  proof  of  work  (PoW)  and  proof  of 
stake (PoS). PoW requires participant miners that the 
work  that  was  done  and  was  submitted  by  them 
qualifies  them  to  receive  the  right  to  add  a  new 
transaction to the chain. PoS involves the allocation 
of  responsibility  in  maintaining  the  ledger  to  a 
participant  miner  in  proportion  to  the  number  of 
virtual currency tokens held by it [50]. 
least,  anonymity 

is  another 
characteristic of blockchain as all inputs are delivered 
through  the  use  of  code  names  (a  unique  digital 
signature). 

Last  but  not 

5  Proposed System 
In  this  section,  we provide  a  top-down  approach  to 
our  system.  First,  we  present  our  middleware 
architecture, emphasising the layers we have chosen 
to  develop  in  order  to  achieve  optimal  execution. 
Second, we present the algorithm of our application 
and  provide  a  step-by-step  explanation  of 
its 
rationale.  Third,  we  briefly  present  our  blockchain 
implementation.  Fourth,  we  illustrate  in  detail  the 
entities  of  our  application  and  present  the  system 
properties where this application was executed.  Last, 
we showcase our results and discuss our findings for 
low  to  mid-size  application  sizes  (based  on  the 
blockchain prefix value i.e. complexity). 

5.1 Middleware Proposed 
Our  middleware  has  a  four-tier  architecture  as  it 
consists of the following layers: 

layer: 

•  Infrastructure 

consisting  of  our 
Raspberry Pi devices and a high-end computer. 
•  Network  layer:  consisting  of  the  network 
properties responsible for generating, storing, 
and maintaining our blockchain architecture. 

layer: 

•  Common  Services 

implementing 
services  to  create  and  update  our  system  and 
via  the  search  and  validation  process  to 
propose reviewers. 
•  Application  Services 

the 
reviewers’ list after successfully executing our 
the  email 
proposed  algorithm, 
invitations,  and 
reviewers’ 
logging 
responses and time frames for submitting their 
reviews. 

sending 
the 

layer:  parsing 

Moreover,  regarding  the  application  services 
layer,  we  have  expanded  on  the  work  of  [51]  to 
ensure that each computing device could act both as 
a server and a client. Analytically, we emphasise this 
attribute as it provides a system without a single point 
of  failure  as  well  as  presenting  a  cloud-based 
application  where  each  computer  can  switch  roles 
between  server-client.  This  would  thus  ensure 
“continuity  of  operation”.  Last,  we  notice  that  the 
common  services  layer  encapsulates  the  business 
logic  of  our  application  whereas  the  application 
services  layer  acts  as  a  level  of  abstraction  for  our 
application default APIs execution. 

As evident from the above, these two layers are 
closely connected as there is not a clear separation of 
concerns.  However,  we  have  chosen  to  split  the 
application’s stage into two layers in order to address 
future  issues  regarding  scalability  and  the  system 
complexity rapidly increases.

5.2  Algorithm Proposed 
In this section, we present the proposed algorithm of 
this  article  used  to  develop  our  database  for 
proposing  reviewers  and  facilitating  a  submission 
process. Specifically, we aim to develop a system that 
would be characterised by a high fairness index for 
both authors and reviewers alike. Analytically, one of 
the  most  common  issues  in  peer-review  that  slows 
down the review process and first-time decisions is 
undoubtedly selecting inappropriate reviewers. This 
is usually achieved either by sending an invitation to 
review  to  people  with  a  "conflict  of  interest"  or 
constantly  providing  an 
invitation  for  specific 
publications to the same reviewers' target group. In 
order to avoid that, we have developed an algorithm 
that took into consideration these issues and focused 
on providing an optimal solution. 

their  metadata 

More  specifically,  we  have  developed  a  Java- 
based system that comprises of 3 stages to optimally 
search  and  propose  the  names  of  possible  review 
candidates.  First,  we  used several  "filterReviewers" 
functions  that  mapped  the  most  suitable  candidates 
for review into a list. Analytically, this was achieved 
by indexing, storing, and searching a preset dataset of 
keywords  in  a  database.  This  constructed  DB 
accumulated  information  from  all  the  submitted 
(titles,  keywords, 
articles  and 
abstracts) as well as other general information (other 
articles, research interests, etc) which were provided 
by their profiles on academic social networking sites 
such  as  ResearchGate,  Academia.edu,  and  other 
academic  open-source  services  such  as  Publons  as 
well as ORCID profiles. Last, after gathering all the 
necessary data, we generated a hash and stored them 
using blockchain technology to ensure anonymity as 
well  as  continuity  of  operations  while  monitoring, 
notifying, activating, and deploying all the necessary 
processes regarding authors-reviewers. 

Second, after filtering and mapping the necessary 
information  to  our  DB,  we  monitored  our  output 
result to ensure that the reviewer was not a past co-
author  and  that  added  a  lower  priority  index  for 
reviewers  who  have  answered  or  declined  our 
previous requests in an effort to further decrease the 
duration  of  the  process.  This stage ensured that the 
submission  system  did  not  waste  time  proposing 
reviewers  who  had  declined  to  review  as  well  as 
categorise  lower  in  the  list  of  our  proposal  the 
reviewers  who  had  already  reviewed  (and  rejected) 
an article. 

Last,  in  the  final  stage  of  our  algorithm,  the 
system sends email invitations over a time frame of 1 
week for the candidates to express their interest and 
respond  positively  or  negatively  (no  answer  is 
considered  as  declined).  Initially,  we  sent  6  email 
invitations  as  we  consider  a  minimum  of  3  and  a 
maximum  of  6  reviews  adequate  to  evaluate  a 
manuscript.  In  the  case  of  a  positive  answer,  the 
system  awaits  the  reviewers'  remarks  for  4  weeks. 
The outline of our algorithm is described in Table 1.

5.3  Blockchain  Application  Implementation 
A blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that is 
duplicated and distributed across an entire network. 
It consists of several different blocks each containing 
a timestamp, the cryptographic hash of the previous 
block,  and  the  transaction  data  of  our  choice. 
Analytically,  the  timestamp  property  assists  the
the 
computation  length  to  adjust  the  mining  difficulty. 
The difficulty is measured by the total time duration 
to  create  a  block  while,  simultaneously,  containing 
the  previous  block  hash  information.  As  a  result,  a 
blockchain that is resistant to modification is created 
where it will be invalid if only one block is altered.

it  allows  all  the  parties  inside  this  p2p  network  to

emphasise that the architectural design principles 

regarding  a  private  blockchain  architecture  dictate 
that only specific organisations and authorised users 
can ensure the immutability, anonymity, and security 
of a blockchain.

A  flow  chart  representing  the  entities  of  the 
proposed  architecture  is  presented  in  Figure  2. 
Analytically, in this class diagram we showcase the 
roles  of  the  user  who  can  act  as  a  reviewer,  a 
publisher,  or  both.  Moreover,  we  emphasise  the 
article  entity  which  illustrates  what  information  is 
crawled and indexed for a document such as its status 
(published,  rejected)  and  the  date/time  it  was 
submitted,  etc.  Furthermore,  as  evident  from  our 
class diagram, a user has a direct relationship with the 
article entity based on their common properties. First, 
a  many-to-many  relationship  exists  between  the 
articles a  user  has  written and  the  opposite,  i.e.  the 
users  who  are  the  authors  of  an  article.  Second, 
between review and user entity occurs as a user may 
review none or many articles (a fact that we are not 
able  to  detect  through  this  relationship).  Last,  the 
review  entity  stores  all  the  information  regarding 
validations, proposing and selecting the most suitable 
reviewers,  as  well  as  several  parameters  for 
safekeeping the review procedure integrity. 

5.5  Application Results 

This section focuses on presenting the results of 
our  benchmarks  regarding  our  simulation  and 
specifically,  the  prefix  value  of  our  blockchain 
architecture. Analytically, increasing the zeroes value 
of the prefix to the required block hash makes it more 
difficult to generate it. 

Specifically,  this  problem  occurs  because  not 
only does it consume more memory but, as evident 
from our tests, the execution time rapidly increases. 
In Figure 3 and Figure 4 we have graphed the mean 
creation time and the mean request number (tries) for 
a  prefix  value  up  to  6.  As  evident,  the  hash  value 
increases  exponentially  for  prefix  numbers  greater 
than  5  where  the  trade-off  between  generating 
encrypted data points and execution time / available 
computer resources is inadvisable. 

Moreover, in Figure 5 we illustrate the results of 
Table 2 in which we notice that CPU usage does not 
fluctuate.  Specifically,  this  occurred  during  all  our 
tests  for  various  prefix  values  whereas,  during  our 
high-end  computer 
the  hash 
consumed on average 7% of the total CPU power on 
an 8 core – 16 threads CPU device using only 1 thread 
to generate the hashes.  

tests,  generating 

Last, with regard to memory usage, from our tests 
we  concluded  that  it  is  tightly  connected  with  the 
prefix value as it gradually increases its value  

to enable the JVM to efficiently take advantage of 
the  available  system  process  for  generating  block 
hashes.

6  Conclusion 
In  this  article,  we  have  developed  a  cloud-based 
application that cold counts, tracks, and monitors an 
academic reviewing system process. Specifically, the 
results of our study for a set of random generated data 
parsed  from  internet  bots  (web  crawlers)  were 
promising, which is why we propose expanding this 
application to real word case scenarios. This means 
that  it  could  be  used  as  a  submission  system  for  a 
medium 
international  conference 
submission system. Furthermore, as evident from our 
benchmarks, this application can be implemented in 
Raspberry Pi computers i.e. into several portable low-
power  and  low-cost  computing  devices  capable  of 
supporting  our  system  without  a  “single  point  of 
failure”. This occurs as all available computers can 
act both as a server and a client, thus providing the 
necessary information and statuses to the blockchain. 
As  for  future  works,  our  system’s  architecture 
should  be  expanded  to  a  multithread  application 
the  hash 
which  would  substantially 
generation uptimes for all the available devices in our 
computer  network.  Moreover,  we  are  planning  to 
open-source  our  APIs  for  other  online  submission 
systems to be able to obtain information on our DB 
of  reviews.  Last,  since  most  of 
the  existing 
submission systems are written in PHP and not Java, 
we plan on expanding our APIs implementation and 
packages to other computer programming languages.
