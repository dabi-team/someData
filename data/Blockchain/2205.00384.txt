Abstract: Blockchain has recently drawn wide attention in the research community. Since its emer- 
gence,  the  world  has  seen  the  expansion  of  this  new  technology,  which  was  initially  developed 
as a digital currency more than a decade ago. A self-administering ledger that ensures extensive 
data  immutability  over  a  peer-to-peer  network  has  made  it  attractive  for  cybersecurity  applications, 
including sensor-enabled Internet  of  Things (IoT) systems.  Brand new  challenges  and questions 
now demand solutions, as IoT devices are now online in a distributed fashion to simplify our ev- 
eryday lives. Motivated by those challenges, the work here has detailed issues from which an IoT 
infrastructure  can  suffer  if  the  wrong  blockchain  technology  is  chosen.    Unlike  a  typical  review, 
this paper focuses on security challenges of the blockchain-IoT eco-system through critical findings 
and  applicable  use  cases.  The  contribution  directs  Blockchain architects,  designers,  and  researchers 
in the domain to select an unblemished combination of Blockchain-powered IoT applications. In 
addition, the paper provides insight into the state-of-the-art Blockchain platforms, namely Ethereum, 
Hyperledger, and IOTA, to exhibit their respective challenges, their constraints, and their prospects 
in terms of performance and scalability.

1. Introduction 

The integration of blockchain (BC) with IoT has shown immense effectiveness and 
potential for future improvements in scalability and productivity. Therefore, how these 
emerging technologies can be deployed together to secure end-to-end and sensor-embedded 
automated solutions while ensuring their scalability and productivity has become a key 
priority.  The  world  has  benefited  from  the  adaptations  of  different  heterogeneous  IoT 
solutions, ranging from healthcare to transportation systems [61]. The existing central- 
ized edge and fog-based IoT infrastructure/applications may not be secure, scalable, and 
efficient enough to address larger enterprise challenges. Most existing IoT solutions are 
concerned with the network of sensor-enabled smart appliances, which permits physical de- 
vice services on the cloud [61]. An immutable timestamp ledger is used for distributed data, 
including payment, contract, personal data storing, data sharing, and healthcare systems, 
due to its salient features such as immutability, a distributed structure, consensus-driven 
behavior, and transparency [62]. 

There  are  various  reasons  why  BC  technology  may  be  highly  promising  for  assuring 
the efficiency, scalability, and security of the heterogeneous IoT setup. The issues related to 
the  emerging IoT networks  and several BC  roles can be solved as follows. Firstly, approxi- 
mately 50 billion devices will be connected by 2022 [63]. Several efforts have been made to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reveal the associated challenges [64].  In response to the adaptability of trillions of  devices 
in the near future, it should not be difficult to handle using decentralized BC technology. 
As BC requires  no centralized database and addresses  are directly addressable, one device 
can directly send information to another [65]. This means that this technology has limitless 
and scalable registration capability. The second issue is how to control a large number of 
devices on a distributed and decentralized platform. In response, BC technology provides 
open peer-to-peer connectivity for intra-device communication between physical or virtual 
appliances [63]. The third one is how it provides compliance and legitimate governance 
for all autonomous systems involved. In response, BC technology has a smart contract- 
based immutable open ledger system. Therefore, transparency is a characteristic of this 
technology that  ensures  more comprehensive autonomy and trustworthy  governance [66]. 
The last concern is how BC technology can address the security complexities of the new 
heterogeneous IoT ecosystem that is rapidly emerging and evolving. Since 2008, Bitcoin has 
been adapting to ongoing Internet challenges [62]. Apart from financial transactions, it has 
shown immense potential in the field of IoT, incorporating features such as an elliptic curve 
digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) [67], the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) [68], message 
signing, differential privacy [65], cryptographic message verification, and others. 

The  goal  of  this  research  is  to  identify  the  trade-offs  that  the  heterogeneous  IoT 
ecosystem  typically  faces  due  to  the  wrong  choice  of  BC  technology.  Unlike  a  survey 
or review, the findings of this research are aimed at solving particular performance and 
scalability issues in a BC-enabled IoT architecture. The contribution directs developers 
and  academics in  this  field to  select the  best  BC-enabled  IoT  applications.  The  claimed 
contributions are justified through the respective sections of the paper. We discuss the 
suitability of BC to eliminate the problems that emerge from BC and IoT integration [69]. 
We  also  explain  how  existing  solutions,  namely,  the  Microsoft  (MS)-Azure  IoT  workbench 
and the IBM IoT architecture, adopt different BC platforms such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum 
(ETH),  Hyperledger  (HLF),  and  Kovan.    The  following  section  illustrates  BC’s  potential 
for specific IoT issues. The challenges come to light through a use case analysis, where a 
sensor-enabled system finds appropriate devices, manages access control, and supports 
the compliance of smart contracts. In addition, this research supports the use of smart 
contracts in IoT systems and points out possible flaws in data integrity, scalability, and 
confidentiality. 

The research paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the related work in this 
field. Section 3 discusses the internal design of BC technology and the specialized categories 
within which it can be applied. The suitability of BC technology for IoT applications with 
comparative analysis and contemporary technologies, including HLF, IOTA, and the MS- 
Azure IoT architecture is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes with a brief table 
and graphs showing the  challenges and proposed solutions at  a glance  as well  as  their 
applicability concerning throughput, latency, and execution time.  Section 6  discusses  a set 
of use cases where BC technology is an inevitable peer of the IoT discussed herein. Finally, 
Section 7 and 8 include a discussion and summary and provide feasible future directions 
and theoretical and practical implications, respectively. 

2. Related Work 

Apart  from  the  financial  domain,  BC  technology  has  been  showing  its  far-reaching 
prospects  in  different  application  areas  since  its  first  emergence  in  2008  [70].  Since  what 
is  written  cannot  be  modified,  the  nature  of  the  BC  ledger,  in  addition  to  the  pseudo- 
anonymous,  traceable  peers  over  the  transparent  distributed  network,  makes  BC  an  indis- 
pensible tool in IoT [71]. The field includes smart areas, grids, vehicles, industry, the supply 
chain,  food  and  drug  safety,  the  e-commerce  of  agricultural  products,  medical  technology, 
and industrial predictive maintenance [72]. Significant research activity has also been done 
in  digital  data  copyright  protection  of,  ID  verification,  real  state  land  ownership  transfer, 
smart-taxation immigration, electronic voting, and privacy-principle compliance [73].  Even 

 
in an IT sector such as Blockstack [74], BigchainDB [75] utilizes the BC smart-contract and 
consensus mechanism. 

Namecoin  incorporates  a  distributed  hash  table  (DHT)  that  communicates  with  the 
virtual  chain  after  separating  BC  dApps,  operations,  and  off-chain  storage  entities  [76]. 
It  hashes  the  name  data  tuples,  state  transitions,  and  records  in  an  on-chain  BC  ledger, 
and  the  DHT  stores  the  payload,  digital  data,  and  associated  signatures.  However,  some 
researchers  have  employed  the  immense  benefits  of  IPFS  for  storing  access  control  and 
compliance  data  [77].  They  proposed  customizing  attribute-based  encryption  after  replac- 
ing  the  centralized  cloud-dependency  by  leveraging  the  public  chain,  namely  Ethereum.  In 
line  with  that,  BigchainDB  employs  a  Tendermint-distributed  database  based  on  the  weak 
synchronization  of  the  BC  engine  deployed  on  the  Byzantine  consensus  (BFT)  [78].  This 
promising data and execution project enables large-scale and real-time data protection and 
management for industrial IoT security and privacy. 

The rapid growth of employing IoT sensors encounters several challenges, such as 
data protection, analytical management, and storing voluminous real-time data [79,80]. 
NoSQL, or the Hadoop repository, initially attracted researchers in the IoT domain but 
was not convincing because of its centralized structure, its single point of failure (SPOF) 
nature, and its security issues [81]. Based on this, the authors proposed an approach after 
attaching  multiple  cloud-centric  database  models  that  were  promising  [80].  However, 
various  dependencies  lead  to  SPOF,  trust,  and  security  intricacies.  Several  comprehensive 
works  have  proposed  an  Edge  solution  to  address  such  challenges,  which  enormously 
motivated the idea we introduce here on BC technology. However, besides miners’ high- 
energy  incentive  disputes,  the  Blockchain  network  encounters  scalability  issues  that  some 
works [82,83] have concentrated on and aimed at solving through plausible remedies [84]. 
Some of the demonstrations, including channel-driven communication between the data 
owner and requester using shared secret keys [85], as well as BC for trusted computing, 
utilized the underlying public Blockchain (i.e., BTC and  ETH) to provide a miner’s network 
that emulates a trusted server. However, apart from the potential threat of leaking secure, 
shared secrets, establishing a secure channel without consortium BC (i.e., HLF and Corda) 
seems untrustworthy. 

In August 2018, focusing on security and privacy, a group of authors proposed apply- 
ing multi-signatures and BC for decentralized energy trading [84,86]. Following the same 
motivation of multi-signature and consortium BC, the authors improved their P2P vehicle 
trading mechanism to the IIoT energy trading system in September 2018. 

The certificate-less cryptography was initially introduced to abolish the key IBE escrow 
issues  in  the  early  years  of  this  century;  however,  several  works  in  the  following  years 
worked toward its efficient improvement [87,88]. From an IoT perspective, multi-signature 
based certificate-less authentication reduces computational costs and signing latency, espe- 
cially  for  a  network  involving  light-weight  sensors  [89].  Considering  the  key  dissipation 
hardship, costs, and latency, one of the latest works portrays a convincing resolution upon 
aggregating  the  Edge  and  DHT.  The  works  claimed  to  be  suitable  for  industrial  IoT  but 
lack details on how it overcomes the public BC network deployment and delay in the trans- 
action  (TX)  generation,  verification,  and  broadcasting  [90].  Moreover,  the  adaption  and 
construction of a key distribution center (KDC) attempted to extenuate system performance 
toward  a  centralized  architecture  [91,92].  Table  1  concludes  the  overview  of  the  selected 
recent literature reviews on BC and BC-based IoT applications.

3. Preliminaries of BC Technology 

The  BC’s main task is  to replace traditional  and trust-created intermediaries  with 
distributed systems to solve common trust issues [65]. It also helps in forming a permanent 
and transparent record of the exchange of processing and avoids the need for an interme- 
diary.  Instant  value  exchange,  decentralized  value  exchange,  and  pseudonymous  value 
transfer are all terms used to describe BC technology [102]. It also makes sure that the 
ledger building preserves a set of transactions shared among all participating nodes, which 
needs to be necessarily verified and validated by others [65,103]. Joining brand new trans- 
actions is commonly referred to as "mining" and requires the solution of a sophisticated 
and large computational problem, which in nature is complex but is easy to authenticate 
using a selected consensus algorithm in a network of untrusted and anonymous nodes. The 
consensus algorithm requires a significant amount of resources in order to ensure that only 
authorized blocks may join  the  network. In addition, the communication  between  nodes is 
encrypted using changeable public keys (PKs) to avoid monitoring, which has attracted 
attention in non-monetary  applications [66]. Moreover, the hash of the  previous  block, the 
timestamp, the transaction root, and the nonce generated by the miner are also seen in a 
sample chain of blocks, which makes the BC more secure [104]. Figure 1 shows an overview 

 
 
 
 
 
of different blocks with timestamp, hash, nonce, and transaction data.  Therefore, using 
BC-enabled applications has become much more transparent because of  this development.

Using high-security smart devices and smart technologies for authentication to ensure 
seamless  communication,  decentralized  data  processing,  or  even  autonomous  systems  for 
data  purchase  and  others  may  demonstrate 
in  this  field  [105]. 
Consequently, the  IoT  devices  might  be  equipped  with  the  Internet  to  make  every  part  of 
human life more convenient and less tedious [106,107].

3.1. Category of BC Technology 

In this section, we have covered three different approaches to BC technology: public 
ledger-based, private ledger-based, and protected ledger-based. A comparative catego- 
rization of BC ledgers is shown in Figure  2 based on the accessibility of the considered 
ledger. 

3.1.1. Public Ledger-Based BC 

In  public  ledger-based  BC  technology,  anyone  can  transmit,  verify,  and  read  transac- 
tions on the network, as well as obtain and run the scripts necessary to participate in the BC 
mining  process  using  several  consensus  methods,  making  it  known  as  a  "permission-less" 
BC  technology  [102].  Even  though  any  anonymous  user  may  transmit,  view,  and  authenti- 
cate an incognito transaction, it offers the highest level of anonymity and transparency [108]. 
ETH [109] and BTC are two of the most common examples of public BC technology.

3.1.2. Private Ledger-Based BC 

Private ledger-based BC does not require a consensus mechanism or mining to provide 
anonymity  because  it  restricts  read  and  modification  rights  to  a  certain  organization.  The 
read authority is sometimes restricted to an arbitrary level, but most of the time, transaction 
editing  is  rigorously  permissioned  [110].  Private-typed  BC  approaches  might  be  stated 
to  be  used  in  the  ledger-building  process  for  coins  controlled  by  Eris  and  Monax  or  the 
Multichain [103]. To cite an example, a permissioned-based BC technology like Quorum is 
now available on ETH, though ETH itself is a public ledger-based BC technology. 

3.1.3. Protected Ledger-Based BC 

The protected ledger-based BC is also known as a consortium/federated, hybrid, or 
public-permissioned BC, which is run and maintained by a group of owners or users [108]. 
Protected ledger-based BCs include HLF by the Linux Foundation [61] and IBM and R3 
with Corda or the Energy Web Foundation [110]. Moreover, if the authority is restricted 
within a validated group, then protected ledger-based BC seems to be more suitable than a 
public or private ledger-based BC system [111]. 

Moreover, Figure 2 shows that, if the system has a centralized or single ledger system, 
no category of the BC is needed there. Additionally, we discussed the performance compar- 
ison between IOTA and the other BC technologies. According to the IOTA team, its ledger 
is a public permission-less backbone for IoT applications [107]. This means it will enable 
transactions between connected devices, and anyone on the network can access its ledger. 

4. Suitability of BC Technology for IoT Applications 

Although BC technology is capable of solving all IoT-related issues, there are a few 
situations  where  a  centralized  database  is  preferable.  BC-based  use  cases  need  to  be 
explored before being implemented in this area. 

4.1. Comparison of Several Consensus Protocols 

Table  2  describes  the  comparison  among  different  popularly  used  consensus  mech- 
anisms  for  BC  technology.  It  shows  that  Proof-of-Work  (PoW)  and  Proof-of-Stake  (PoS) 
need  more  computational  resources  in  contrast  to  Byzantine  fault  tolerance  (BFT)  and 
proof-of-authority  (PoA),  which  outperform  their  peers.  However,  BFT  and  PoA  are  both 
difficult  to  adjust  [112].  Even  though  they  have  dependencies,  they  seem  to  work  for  IoT 
nodes.  For  scalability  and  overhead,  blocks  needed  to  be  verified  by  all  nodes  available 
in  the  network,  with  a  quadratic  increase  in  traffic  and  a  disobedient  overhead  of  data 
processing  power,  which  requires  many  expandable  IoT  devices  (e.g.,  LORA)  with  limited 
bandwidth [105].  IoT  devices  tend  to fail  with  higher  delays,  but BTC  takes  nearly  30  min 
to finalize a transaction. It also has security overhead, making it inapplicable for IoT [113]. 
Because  of  the  interaction  between  IoT  nodes,  the  throughput  of  BTC  (7/transaction)  will 
push  it  over  the  limit.  As  a  result,  many  people  have  switched  from  BTC  to  BFT-based 
HLF or non-consensus-driven systems such as IOTA [61,102]. The applicability of different 
BC-based  systems  depends  on  whether  consensus  and  non-consensus  approaches  are 
discussed.

4.2. Comparative Analysis of ETH, HLF, and IOTA Technology 

ETH  technology,  launched  with  the  intention  of  competing  with  BTC,  is  a  flexible 
BC platform  with  a required  smart-contract  and  PoW consensus  mechanism  known  as 
Ethash, which generates the probabilistic hash using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) [66]. 
It greatly helps with extensive IoT applications and some of its efficiency trade-offs. ETH 
needs almost 20 s to open a new block after mining, as  Ethash works based on the PoW 
mechanism [102]. 

HLF is an authenticated and encrypted type of BC technology. It applies authentication 
widely, along  with chain-code-based smart contracts and consensus with  existing  practical 
Byzantine  fault  tolerance  (PBFT)  [67].  Anchors  of  trust  are  added  to  the  asymmetric 
cryptographic  technique  and  the  digital  signature  qualities  with  SHA3  or  ECDSA  as  an 
additional feature of the system [102]. A self-execution capacity such as asset or resource 
transfer across  network peers  is required for its implementation  of  smart contracts. It 
has low latency with respect to other comparative distributed ledger implementations. 
Furthermore, according to IBM’s Bluemix-Watson IoT design, which is shown in the next 
section, Fabric was selected as the BC medium. 

IOTA is an unique distributed ledger that does not use an explicit BC at all; rather, 
it  implements  a  DAG  of  transactions.  In  place  of  multi-block  transactions,  individual 
transactions are approved and two other transactions are implied [102]. IOTA tangles have 
the  potential  to be effectively integrated  with  the  IoT  in order  to provide  security and 
privacy. 

Figure 3 shows a comparative analysis of ETH, HLF, and IoTA technology in terms  of 

performance and scalability.

Figure 4 shows the Azure IoT framework, which, depending on the smart contract, 
streamlines client-side based applications for both web and mobile. It is used to validate, 
retrieve, and test programs or to consider novel use cases. A user interface is introduced for 
the end users to interact with it in different ways. Authenticated users can interact with the 
admin console, allowing them to use many functionalities, e.g., upload and deploy smart 
contacts depending on appropriate roles.

Figure 4. Azure IoT reference architecture that has been integrated with BC for securing IoT devices. 

Figure 4 illustrates the REST API-based gateway service API used to replicate and 
send messages to an event broker, where the expansion of data into the BC technology 
is attempted. When data are requested, quarries are submitted to an off-chain database. 
Replicas  of  all  chained  meta-data  and  bulk-data  that  issue  relevant  configurations  for 
smart-contract support are contained in the SQL database. Thus, developers can directly 
access the gateway servicing API to develop BC technology. Direct data submission to the 
service bus is an option for users who want their messages to be sent widely throughout 
the  Azure  infrastructure.  As  an  example,  this  API  may  be  used  to  build  sensor-based 
tools or federated systems. In addition, there are several events hosted over the life of 
the application [102]. The gateway API or even the ledger’s alerting trigger downstream 
code can accomplish this dependence on previous events. There are two types of event 
consumers that the MS-Azure consortium may locate [61]. The first one, enabled by the 
events,  remains  on  the  BC  to  access  the  off-chain  SQL  database.  As  a  final  response,  it 
collects  meta-data  from  API  events  related  to  document  upload  and  storage.  Figure  4 
shows how the MS Azure IoT workbench becomes familiar with different BC frameworks. 
The MS Azure architecture may also be used to support HLF Fabric, Corda R3, and IOTA. 
The IoT Hub is connected to the IoT sensors through a bus, and the Transaction Builder is 
connected to this bus. Finally, in order to create a scalable and secure IoT device, an existing 
IoT workbench may be integrated with MS Azure. 

4.4. IBM BC-Integrated IoT Architecture. 

The IBM BC architecture for IoT solutions has three principal tiers, each with different 
roles [61]. Figure 5 shows a high-level IoT architecture that includes HLF Fabric as a BC 
service, Watson as an IoT Platform, and Bluemix as a cloud environment [68]. It can be 
divided into several components, as shown in Figure 5, showing its three layers, a service 
execution method, and the challenges it confronts. It also shows how IBM Blumix works. 
When executed, data gathered by smart devices and intelligent sensors are introduced to 
Watson using the ISO standard Message-Queuing-Telemetry-Transport (MQTT) protocol. 
Depending on the settlement, certain BC proxies are used to send data from Watson to the 
chain code of the HLF Fabric and are executed in the cloud.

Figure 5. IBM Watson and Bluemix have been integrated with the IoT-BC service. Using Bluemix’s 
BC network, Watson can communicate with IoT devices via Github’s smart contact repository. 

Furthermore, the HLF Fabric uses, instead of smart contracts, chain code written in 
Go. The desired business logic is elaborated by it and gives shape to the core distributed 
ledger  solutions.  Each  transaction  is  preserved  and  prevailed,  which  is  needed  for  BC 
transactions. Fabric contracts being chain-coded need certain APIs to run. As such, the 
chain code is in need of registration with services using any predefined APIs. Software 
development kits (SDKs) help developers to make Node.js applications that can maintain 
communication with BC networks. APIs are used to register and submit applications. The 
IBM BC-integrated IoT architecture on Bluemix provides many benefits to the distributed 
network, such as trust, autonomy, scalability, and security. There are many issues to be 
resolved. One of the important issues is hardware resources [66], since IoT devices are 
mostly low-powered devices and have less computation power. Therefore, encryption and 
transaction verification may use considerable electricity, which will increase both energy 
consumption and costs. 

5. Challenges and Solutions for BC-Based IoT Applications. 

Despite the many appealing features of BC for IoT applications, there are several chal- 
lenges that must be addressed before successful adoption. The storage capacity, throughput, 
latency, execution time, privacy and security, and scalability of the BC-based IoT appli- 
cations are addressed in this section. Following that, we have also thoroughly explained 
some inevitable challenges and their possible solutions. Figure 6 shows the challenges in 
BC-based IoT applications.

5.1. Challenges in Storage Capacity 

As  previously  discussed,  ETH  and  BTC  have  storage  issues.  Figure  7  shows  how  the 
storage  capacity  has  been  increasing  day  by  day  from  2015  to  the  first  quarter  of  August 
2021. The storage-intensive BC infrastructure is less suitable for heterogeneous IoT systems 
[114].  The  massive  amount  of  data  generated  by  IoT  devices  raises  the  likelihood  of  a 
system  crash  due  to  the  additional  storage  overhead  [115].  In  real-time  heterogeneous 
IoT  systems,  ETH  appears  to  be  better  suited  for  storage  capacity  than  BTC,  as  shown  in 
Figure  7.  However,  the  storage  capacity  of  a  BC  is  not  the  only  aspect  that  determines 
whether it is suited for heterogeneous IoT systems.

5.2. Challenges in Throughput 

Furthermore,  we  have  considered  the  throughput  of  several  BC  technologies.  Fig- 
ure  8  compares  the  throughput  of  ETH,  ETH  Parity,  and  HLF  Fabric  in  terms  of  the 
number of transactions per second, where HLF has the highest throughput for the Yahoo- 
Cloud-Serving-Benchmark (YCSB) and the Smallbank database. The datasets were found 
from [102], where they used the Blockbench framework to collect data. ETH Parity, on 
the other hand, has the lowest throughput compared to the others, implying that it is less 
appropriate for real-time heterogeneous BC-based IoT infrastructures.

5.3. Challenges in Latency and Execution Time 

We have also considered the latency and execution time of several BC technologies. 
Figure 9 compares the latency and execution time of ETH, ETH Parity, and HLF Fabric, 
where HLF has the lowest latency and execution time for both databases. One of the ETH 
implementations,  ETH  Parity,  is  an  alternative  BC  solution  for  IoT  applications.  Therefore, 
we considered both the ETH and ETH Parity to calculate latency and execution time. In 
addition, the Linux Foundation hosts the HLF, an open-source collaborative program aimed 
at improving cross-industry BC technology [107].

5.4. Challenges in Privacy and Security 

BC technology works as a public ledger that secures and authenticates transactions 
and data through cryptography, which is more complex. With the rise and widespread 
adoption of BC technology, data breaches have become frequent. User information and 
data  are  often  stored,  mishandled,  and  misused,  posing  a  threat  to  personal  security 
and privacy.  In  terms  of  security,  the  data  need  to  be  tamper-proof,  as  some  of  the 
nodes

may  act  maliciously or  be  compromised. As  a result,  proper security  must  be  ensured 
before integration with the IoT infrastructure. Moreover, in terms of privacy, the data or 
transactions belong to various nodes in BC technology. Therefore, privacy needs to be 
ensured before integration with the IoT infrastructure. 

5.5. Challenges in Scalability 

Finally, we consider the scalability of several BC technologies. The scalability of BC 
technology is composed of node scalability and performance scalability. Node scalability in 
BC networks refers to the extent to which the network can add more participants without a 
loss in performance. Performance scalability refers to the number of transactions processed 
per  second,  impacted  by  the  latency  between  transactions  and  each  block  size.  A  BC 
technology is considered scalable if it can add thousands of globally distributed nodes 
while still processing thousands of transactions per second. Currently, none of the existing 
BCs are appreciably scalable. Figure 10 shows a comparison of scalability, some of which 
are currently in use and some of which are in development.

Figure 10. Scalability comparison between ETH, BTC, HLF, and other technologies still in develop- 
ment. 

Public  BCs  such  as  BTC  and  ETH,  by  using  PoW  consensus  mechanisms,  have  high 
node scalability and low performance scalability. On the contrary, HLF Fabric has low node 
scalability  but  high  performance  scalability.  For  heterogeneous  IoT  infrastructures  of  less 
than 20 nodes, this technology might be a viable solution. However, if we need more nodes, 
the amount of messaging that takes place between the nodes in PBFT can lower transaction 
throughput  significantly.  Therefore,  a  large-scale  IoT  system  will  be  unable  to  successfully 
integrate with BC technology unless these challenges are appropriately solved. 

5.6. Prominent Challenges and Solutions 

There is a wide variety of IoT systems, from simple to complex cyber-physical systems, 
making it impossible to place all of the challenges and possible solutions in one table.  Table 
3  summarizes  some  challenges,  important  characteristics,  and  their  possible  solutions, 
respectively  [68].  We  have  identified  seven  potential  challenges  and  their  respective  BC 
solutions  with  key  attributes  that  may  be  addressed  before  they  are  deployed  to  an  IoT 
infrastructure [116].

Challenges 

Important Characteristics 

Possible Solutions 

Transaction 
Throughput 

The  real-time  IoT  data  may  be  lost  if  the  transaction 
confirmation time of public ledgers spans from 100 to 
2000 TPS (Transactions Per Second). 

Ripple  claims  to  consume  less  time 
each  transaction  compared  to  BTC, 
ETH, Corda, and Quorum. 

Consumption of 
Energy 

In order to run cryptographic algorithms, IoT systems 
must be light-weight and have enough power. 

Adaptation  may  be  possible  if  man- 
ufacturing  processes  are  planned  to 
utilize energy. 

Confidential 
Private-Key 
Features 

To protect against eavesdropping, DTL frequently em- 
ploys an asymmetric encryption strategy that takes ad- 
vantage of the IoT’s public key infrastructure. 

Distributed IoT ledgers may be struc- 
tured so that the entire ledger does not 
need to be replicated either. 

Availability of the 
Data  Transmis- 
sion Space 

A block size of 1 MB takes 10 min, which means that the 
data rate might be close to 150 MB per day. Consider- 
able bandwidth would be required for this, and tiny IoT 
WANs such as Sigfox or LoRA do not have that. 

Distributed IoT ledgers may be struc- 
tured so that the entire ledger does not 
need to be replicated. 

Congestion of the 
Transactions 

A  transaction  may  occur  if  the  transaction  exceeds  the 
ledger’s  maximum  throughput  limit,  which  may  result 
in increased user costs. Even with the limit provided  by 
ripple or ETH, the real-time requirement is still not met. 

The non-mining tangle-based IOTA’s 
zero-fee transaction technique might 
be used. 

The 
of 
Cost 
Mining  and  the 
Volatility  of  the 
Price 

Storage  and  Scala- 
bility  of  the  Data 
Chain 

IoT devices that are sensitive to power consumption may 
not be able to use public BCs because they require high- 
priced hardware that  relies  on high-power computing. 

Low-power  consensus,  private  BCs, 
and non-mining DTL are all viable so- 
lutions. 

In  January  2019,  BTC,  ETH,  and  IOTA  had  each  sur- 
passed  200  GB,  125  GB,  and  25  GB  in  size,  indicating 
that  the  volume  of  data  that  would  need  to  be  stored 
to support 75 billion intelligent devices will become in- 
creasingly difficult to handle. 

Distributed ledgers and big-data han- 
dling solutions might help to alleviate 
the problem. 

6. Use Case Analysis 

The emerging application of distributed ledgers for BC technology can be divided into 
three categories: areas with common IoT controls, areas where IoT is suitable, and areas with 
efficient IoT solutions, according to the research on BC and distributed ledgers conducted by 
GSMA in collaboration with several mobile operators [117].  Figure 11 shows a comparison 
of different application areas, where six application areas (e.g., support compliance, device 
identity, data sharing, access control, micro-payments, and the supply chain) are considered 
for BC-based IoT use cases following assessments made by 10 operators, each with different 
priorities.  The  priority  of  interest  of  the  operators  were  divided  into  three  categories: 
minimum, medium, and maximum. For data-sharing applications, three different operators 
stated  that  it  should  be  a  minimum  or  medium  priority,  while  five  operators  stated  that  it 
should be the highest priority, as shown in Figure 11. On the other hand, all operators stated 
that the access control application was a minimum priority. Furthermore, not all operators 
stated  that  micro-payment  applications  were  a  medium  priority.  Rather,  five  operators 
stated  either  a  maximum  or  the  minimum  priority.  For  support  compliance  and  device 
identity applications, five operators stated that it as a medium priority. According to GSMA, 
the  dataset  was  generated  by  sincerely  exploring  all  operators,  but  more  investigation  is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needed  before  it  can  be  used  for  technical  and  industrial  purposes.  Apart  from  these 
applications, Blockchain is also used for software-defined IoT infrastructures [118]. Similar 
work can be found in [119]. The next sections address most important four use cases that 
are closely related to performance, security, and scalability.

Areas of Application 

Figure 11.  Application  areas  of  six  considered  BC-based  IoT  use  cases  following  assessments  made 
by 10 operators with different priorities. 

6.1. Use Case: Finding Appropriate IoT Devices 

Device credential retrieval and tracking has been an important aspect in IoT enabling. 

Examples of intelligent IoT devices may be found in the following cases. 

•  Case 1: For authentication reasons, the original data and the current state of the device 
are stored. For example, it is important to verify the serial numbers supplied to ensure 
that  the  manufacturing  firm  or  party  is  accredited  by  a  third-party  quality  assurance 
body. 

•  Case 2: The ledger’s metadata are used to verify the authenticity of software upgrades 

from trusted sources. 

•  Case 3: Personal data such as hardware configurations, software versions, and boot 

code installations should be preserved to maintain privacy. 

6.2. Use Case: Managing IoT Access Control 

In order to retain access control data for physical and virtual resources, an IoT network 
monitoring  and  recording  system  is  unavoidable.  The  following  are  some  examples  of 
possible applications. 

•  Case 1:  The  ledger  is  used  by  a  virtual  file  sharing  server  to  protect  the  identity  of 
persons and apps by encrypting access privileges for printing, saving, and editing. For 
example,  for  clients  purchasing  something  online  while  away  from  home  and  cannot 
receive it, adopting a distributed ledger rather than a key, address, or other potentially 
abused code can be an advantage. 

•  Case 2: The ledger’s metadata are used to verify the authenticity of software upgrades 

from trusted sources.

Table 4. Key advantages and BC applicability for the IoT finding use case. 

Use Case 

Finding Appropriate IoT Devices 

Key Advantages        Ensuring consistent device identification information is important 
for preventing vulnerabilities to unexpected third-party surveil- 
lance  attacks.  It  can  also  help  to  keep  track  while  adding  new 
devices to the ledger. Any company or entity with an interest and 
with legitimate rights can obtain the necessary information before 
making a deal. 

BC Applicability     Both public and protected BC technologies could be resilient as 
an application in response to the cases mentioned. Sovrin with 
a zero knowledge proof allows users to assert their own identity 
information without disclosing data directly through the ledger. 

Table 5.  Key advantages and BC applicability for the IoT access control use case. 

Use Case 

Managing IoT Access Control 

Key Advantages        Limiting resource  access for  a  specific time using  a  generalized 
API solution using smart contract rules. Access could be moni- 
tored and stored or temporarily locked by using immutable trace- 
ability to ward off illegitimate requests and to keep information 
for  later  use.  Better  availability  and  attack  resilience  could  be 
achieved by copying the permission among participating nodes. 

BC  Applicability  Public  BCs  supporting  smart  contracts  such  as  Ethereum  and 
crypto projects such as Sovrin are able to build access manage- 
ment and privacy. HLF Fabric supports smart contracts such as 
chain-code approaches that can easily solve access control scenar- 
ios as discussed. 

6.3. Use Case: Supporting the Compliance of Smart Contracts 

There are several situations involving various organizations in which it is crucial to 
determine whether or not all of them are being effectively complied with. Thus, BC smart 
contracts may be used to quickly and effectively enforce compliance. The following are 
some cases of possible applications. 

Case 1: Distributed ledgers can be used by individuals who share personal data with 
their healthcare provider to ensure that only authorized medical personnel have access 
to that information. Ideally, the pharmacy and the general practitioner in a multiparty 
system should only communicate the patient’s blood pressure readings in order to 
facilitate the dispensing of recommended medications. 
Case 2: If a flight is delayed by 30 min, an individual may have to pay an additional $2 
for  airport  cab  service.  Upon  arrival,  the  smart  contract  may  detect  whether  the  addi- 
tional premium has been  paid in full or  not  in the event of  micro-insurance premiums, 
e.g., due to a reduced cost feature of the service delivery in the smart contract. For all of 
the problems raised in the use cases, BC technology may be an effective solution. 
Case 3:  There must be verification of one’s driving credentials, such as a valid driver’s 
licence  and  a  clean  criminal  history  record,  before  one  may  drive  a  linked  automobile. 
Even the automobile itself may submit trip data, service history, and even self-reported 
defects. One of the most efficient  ways to gather data in a situation  where hundreds of 
thousands of people are involved is to use a smart contract and BC technology. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 of 23 

Table 6. Key advantages and BC applicability for the supporting smart contract compliance use case. 

Use Case 

Supporting the Compliance of Smart Contracts 

Key  Advantages  Smart  contract  data  is  immutable,  so  tricky  mileage  changes  could 
easily be prevented  with  necessary transparency. For  example, the 
journey transaction will only be added to the ledger if the odometer 
reading at the end is greater than the initial record. 

BC  Applicability  Public  BCs  such  as  Ethereum  or  open  source  projects  such  as  HLF 
could  be  applied.  Given  that  the  ledger  is  not  competing  with 
the  resource,  permissioning  administration,  and  transaction  fee 
exemption, IBM HLF Fabric is better suited for this type of scenario. 
Ripple seems to be scaling in the Visa payment system. However, 
applying IOTA could be more useful in a micro-payment case such 
as  Case  1,  as  it  is  designed  to  suit  the  necessarily  required  IoT 
scalability. 

6.4. Use Case: Maintaining Data Integrity and Confidentiality 

In  a  distributed  ledger  paradigm,  it  is  frequently  hoped  that  data  exchange  while 
maintaining sufficient confidentiality is conceivable [120]. The ability to retain the sequence 
of  digital  signatures  and  data  hashes  provided  by  BC  may  be  used  to  assert  data  integrity 
and IoT-related data effectively.  The following are some examples of possible applications. 

•  Case 1: The manufacturing company’s servers are expected to receive data from IoT 
devices. For instance, an intelligent thermostat linked to cloud services can provide 
data to the firm concerning component wear when it chooses when to turn on and 
off  based  on  the  current  weather  situation.  This  problem  can  be  addressed  using 
existing solutions, such as public key infrastructure (PKI)-driven approaches, but BC 
appears to be more efficient in preventing the need to reinvent procedures with regard 
to integrity and privacy. 

•  Case 2: An alarm system for a home or workplace may be managed by a variety of 
people with varying levels of access credentials. If intruders obtain access to it, law 
enforcement  officials may  need  to use remote  access to investigate. A distributed 
ledger might be particularly beneficial in this situation, which involves millions of 
devices being interconnected [107]. 

•  Case 3:  An individual may want their health care data to be shared with a researcher 
or  medical  staff  through  a  personal  fitness  tracker.  As  a  result,  an  individual  may  be 
ready  to  pay  a  micro  premium  for  services  provided  by  a  manufacturer.  When  smart 
houses  feature  weather  station/air  monitoring  IoT  products  that  are  shared  by  many 
parties, users similarly may consent to this kind of information sharing. A  distributed 
ledger may be the only option for a network of machine manufacturers, practitioners, 
and researchers that appears to be unmanageably vast. 

•  Case 4:  As a micro-generator, e.g., in a wind turbine, BC may be integrated into smart 
power grids to record the entire quantity of energy generated and then be used to 
calculate net supplier payments. Using a distributed ledger and a smart contract, it 
is possible to ensure that payments are made on time and in accordance with the 
agreed-upon rate.

Table 7.  Key advantages  and BC  applicability for  the  data  integrity  and  confidentiality  use case. 

Use Case 

Maintaining Data Integrity and Confidentiality 

Key  Advantages  In  contrast  with  mobile  or  web  applications  based  on  relational 
databases, which demand operation and development efforts, dis- 
tributed ledgers can easily maintain ledgers with multiple parties. 
There is no need for them to develop their own bespoke API either. 
The common API and functions of the distributed ledger save time 
and effort, and no extra scalability is required to ensure data in- 
tegrity, security, and privacy. 

BC  Applicability  Though  public  BCs  such  as  BTC  and  ETH  show  inefficiency,  the 
directed acyclic graph-based IOTA is able to meet the challenges 
considering scalability required for a micro-payment system and 
for data sharing with integrity. Linux’s open source project, namely 
HLF Fabric, is also able to ensure data sharing and integrity. 

7. Discussion 

Disruptive  innovations  always  elicit  a  tremendous  deal  of  discussion  and  debate. 
Despite the fact that there are many opponents of virtual currencies, it appears unassailable 
that  the  technology  that  underpins  them  represents  a  major  step  forward  in  technical 
development. BC is a technology that is here to stay. However, there are hazards, such as 
updating the technology without fully insuring its operation or applying it to scenarios 
where the cost of the improvement does not outweigh the cost of its modification. As a 
result, the advantages of using BC technology with IoT applications should be thoroughly 
considered and approached with prudence. For the purpose of achieving a successful col- 
laboration between BC technology and IoT applications, this study gives an overview of the 
major hurdles  that  both  technologies must  overcome.  We  have identified  the  critical areas 
in which BC technology may assist in the improvement of IoT applications. In addition, 
an evaluation has been presented to demonstrate the viability of using BC nodes on IoT 
devices. For the purpose of completing the study, existing platforms and applications were 
also analyzed, providing a comprehensive picture of the interplay between BC technology 
and  the IoT  paradigm.  It  is expected that BC technology  will revolutionize  IoT devices. 
The integration of these two technologies should be addressed, taking into account the 
challenges identified in this paper.  The adoption of regulations is key to the inclusion of 
BC  technology  and  IoT  devices.  This  adoption  could  speed  up  the  upcoming  fourth 
industrial revolution. Consensus will also play a key role in the inclusion of the IoT as part 
of the mining processes and in distributing more BC technology. Nevertheless, a dualism 
between data confidence and the facilitation of the inclusion of embedded devices could 
arise. Lastly, beyond throughput, scalability, latency, and storage capacity, which affect 
both technologies, research efforts should also be made to ensure the security and privacy 
of these critical technologies. 

8. Conclusions 

The usage of BC technology is an emerging area of research, aimed at the development 
of efficient and scalable solutions for heterogeneous IoT applications. There is considerable 
concern about how efficiently BC technology can be integrated with common IoT devices 
while maintaining maximum throughput and privacy. In this manuscript, we have intro- 
duced different existing BC platforms and the key challenges involved in integrating them 
with IoT applications. In addition, this paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of 
how  different  BC  platforms (e.g., BTC, ETH,  and  IOTA) can  be used in IoT  applications. 
Finally, we discuss some  relevant use cases regarding the IoT’s leading BC technology that 
could be helpful. It is concluded that all of the technologies discussed have great potential 
as a development platform aimed at enabling the efficient and real-time deployment of 
heterogeneous  smart  devices  on  a  distributed  network.  In  all,  the IOTA  technology  is 

 
 
 
 
 
18 of 23 

an open-source distributed ledger and cryptocurrency designed for IoT devices, which is 
more efficient in solving transaction latency and mining reward issues by saving costs and 
increasing performance. Furthermore, as public, private, and protected BCs each have their 
own set of benefits and limitations in various situations, further studies may be  conducted 
to precisely pinpoint the pitfalls. If the challenges that arise, e.g., real-time automation and 
secure data processing, can be minimized, BC could be a driving force for a future driven 
by secured technology, 

8.1. Theoretical Implications 

Through  insights  on BC and its applicability to IoT, BC  researchers and developers in 
the industry can make informed decisions about its integration into other systems. This 
research shows that whether a system needs BC. For a centralized solution, BC will not 
add any value. In addition, different consensus mechanisms are discussed to understand 
what sort of consensus seems applicable to a given problem.  The comparison appears 
to provide conclusive evidence that private and consortium BCs are better suited for IoT 
security  applications.  In  addition,  various  types  of  applications,  such  as  IBM’s  Watson 
and Microsoft Azure, are discussed so that researchers can gain practical knowledge in 
the domain. Furthermore, apart from BC, IOTA, which is a BC-like solution but not BC in 
nature, is also discussed. IOTA acts as an alternative means of IoT security and seems to 
have higher performance because of its DAG ledger structure. Finally, industry standard 
use cases with specific  problems are presented to  provide insight into how BC integration 
can cause several problems. It has many advantages and can be used in many different 
ways, which should help researchers and developers in the field. 

8.2. Practical Implications 

In  terms  of  the  practical  implications  of  our  findings,  future  researchers  in  this  field 
can use  the findings of this  study to develop new BC-based IoT applications. Furthermore, 
researchers  should  be  aware  of  the  privacy  and  security  issues  that  can  result  from  the 
failed integration of these technologies or their misuse. In addition, companies can use our 
results to  better understand users’ appreciation of the security of BC-based IoT connected 
devices,  improve  their  products,  or  help  users  thoroughly  understand  the  risks  of  the 
excessive use of such devices. 

8.3. Limitations and Future Research 

There  are  three  major  limitations  to  this  study  that  could  be  addressed  in  future 
research. First, the study focuses on only six performance parameters of BC-enabled IoT 
applications (e.g., storage capacity, throughput, latency, privacy and security, scalability, 
and execution time). In the future, we will consider more performance metrics related to 
these heterogeneous applications. The second limitation is related to the BC technology. 
In this paper, we consider only ETH, BTC, and HLF. In the future, we will also consider 
some of the latest BC technologies, some of which are in the development phase. Finally, 
we  consider  only  two  existing  workbenches  for  BC-enabled  IoT  applications  (e.g.,  the 
MS-Azure IoT workbench and the IBM BC-integrated IoT workbench). In the future, we 
will look into more workbench techniques for these heterogeneous applications. 

Furthermore, in further research, it is necessary to focus on improving the analysis 
processes used in this study as well as identify new issues related to the safety of BC-enabled 
IoT devices and user privacy in smart living environments.
