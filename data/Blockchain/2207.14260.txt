Abstract

Decentralization is a widespread concept across disciplines such as Economics, Political Science

and Computer Science, which use it in distinct but overlapping ways. Here, we investigate the

scholarly history of the term by analysing 425k academic publications mentioning (de)centralization.

We reveal that the fraction of papers on the topic has been exponentially increasing since the 1950s,

with 1 author in 154 contributing to a paper on (de)centralization in 2021. We then cluster papers

using both semantic and citation information and show that the topic has independently emerged in

diﬀerent ﬁelds, while cross-disciplinary contamination started only more recently. Finally, focusing

on the two most prominent clusters by number of papers and inﬂuence, we show how Blockchain has

become the most inﬂuential ﬁeld about 10 years ago, while Governance dominated before the 1990s,

and we characterize their interactions with other ﬁelds. Our results add a quantitative dimension

to the history of a key yet elusive concept. Furthermore, the introduced framework is general and

our publicly released pipeline may be used to run similar analyses on other concepts in the academic

literature.

Introduction

“For students of recent domestic aﬀairs it is becoming increasingly evident that ‘decentralization’ is a

magic word”. With these words in 1975 Herbert London opens his article “The meaning of decentraliza-

tion” [1]. Almost 50 years later, Schneider states that decentralization “is called for far more than it is

theorized or consistently deﬁned” [2]. (De)centralization (i.e., either Decentralization or its counterpart

Centralization) has indeed become almost a buzzword, permeating not only the academic literature,

but also the public discussion. The debate between centralized and decentralized contact tracing at the

beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example [3]. However, one of the major drivers of its

growth has certainly been the rise of blockchain based technologies such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs and

the metaverse. [4, 5, 6, 7].

However, (de)centralization is not a new concept, and has diﬀerent connotations across ﬁelds.

In

political science, it usually refers to the delegation of power to local communities with respect to a cen-

tral government [8]. The concept has similar connotations when referring to educational [9], ﬁscal [10]

and more generally governance systems. Other domains where the term is widely used include public

health [11], internet protocols [12], robot swarms [13] and social network analysis [14] among others, with

the last one providing one of the few quantitative deﬁnitions available thanks to Freeman in 1978 [15].

Given this background, some questions naturally arise: have these diﬀerent disciplines independently

developed the concept of (de)centralization, maybe even with diﬀerent meanings (i.e., a case of poly-

semy)? Have they inﬂuenced each other? Which ﬁelds have been most inﬂuential to the evolution of

this concept?

Here, we address these questions by studying a corpus of scientiﬁc literature indexed by the Semantic
Scholar open database [16]. First, we observe an exponentially growing interest in the topic, with an

author in 154 contributing to a paper mentioning (de)centralization in 2021. Then, we map the litera-

ture on (de)centralization by focusing on the subset of relevant articles and clustering them according to

semantic and citation information. In this way, we discover that diﬀerent academic ﬁelds have separately

contributed to this topic. We hence study how the diﬀerent clusters have inﬂuenced each other, showing

how more transfer of knowledge between diﬀerent academic areas is happening in recent years. Inter-

estingly, our analysis reveals that STEM and social sciences did not inﬂuence each other. Finally, we

focus on two paradigmatic examples: Governance, interpreted generally as “the way that organizations or

countries are managed at the highest level, and the systems for doing this” [17], and Blockchain, including

all blockchain based technologies, from cryptocurrencies to NFTs and the metaverse. We show, indeed,

how Governance is the ﬁrst cluster to extensively make use of the term (de)centralization, containing the

most or second most number of papers each year since its appearance in the 1950s, and playing a leading

role in the transfer of knowledge to other ﬁelds until the 1990s. Blockchain instead has become both

the most inﬂuential cluster and the most productive cluster in the past 10 years, showing three diﬀerent

phases in its recent history characterized by diﬀerent interactions with other ﬁelds. Overall, our results

shed light on the history and evolution of the concept of (de)centralization. Furthermore, we publicly

release the code of the pipeline developed in this study, so that it may be used to study and understand

the evolution of other concepts through the lenses of the academic literature.

The pipeline

In this section, we brieﬂy describe the pipeline we have set up and publicly released1 to select the data
and perform the research described in this study. The pipeline is conceptually divided into three steps:

(1) data collection, (2) clustering of the dataset using a multilayer hierarchical stochastic block model,

and (3) analysis of the inﬂuence between clusters over time using the methodology of knowledge ﬂows.

Step 1: Data Collection

The ﬁrst step consists in collecting the academic publications data related to the concept of (de)centralization,

or potentially to other concepts. To perform a large scale analysis of the academic literature, we exploit

the possibility to access the publicly available Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG, pronounced

1See https://github.com/alberto-bracci/decentralization.

“stag”), providing monthly snapshots of research papers published in all ﬁelds [16]. Launched in 2015

by the Allen Institute for Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI2), Semantic Scholar provides this corpus as an open

access database with the speciﬁc scope of facilitating scientiﬁc analysis of academic publications.
It
contains about 203.6M papers (1st Jan. 2022 snapshot), 76.4M authors, and 2B citations. Moreover,
this database recently incorporated the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) [18], which was shut down

at the end of 2021 [19].

From this corpus we extracted the data about papers that contain the root string “centraliz” or

“centralis” in words of the title or abstract, to capture possibly all variations of words related to the

concepts of Centralization and Decentralization (nouns, adjectives etc.). In this way, we also incidentally

captured articles written in diﬀerent languages, mainly Portuguese, French and Spanish, and also a

minority of unrelated articles (e.g., biology articles involving plant species including “centralis” in their
name). The resulting dataset has 425k papers characterized by a series of attributes. Among these, of

particular interest to us there is the title, the abstract, the authors, all in- and out-citations (respectively

citations and references), the year of publication, and the ﬁelds of study, which were determined based

on machine learning ﬁeld classiﬁers leveraging on the existing MAG taxonomy and classiﬁcation [20].

See Table S1 in the Supplementary information (SI) for details on how many papers have each of these

attributes.

Step 2: Hierarchical clustering

In the Semantic Scholar corpus almost each paper is associated to a list of ﬁelds of study. However,

these are high-level, as there are in fact only 19 ﬁelds of very heterogeneous sizes (see Table S2 in the

SI for details on how many papers are classiﬁed in each ﬁeld of study). Moreover, sometimes the ﬁelds

are not correctly assigned. In the second step of the pipeline, we hence use a multilayer hierarchical

stochastic block model (hSBM) [21, 22], developed to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant clusters at multiple

hierarchical levels for the analysis of text data with multiple data types. Here, in fact, we consider
two layers. The document layer —where links represent citations between papers— and the text layer

—a bipartite network between documents and the words present in their titles. The method naturally

produces clusters of documents and topics (word clusters), incorporating the information from both

layers in the process. Furthermore, as the name suggests, the model produces a hierarchical clustering,

providing a richer structure of both article clusters and topics, which captures both small clusters and

topics and how they are related to each other in a higher level structure. To make sure results are robust,

the algorithm is run 10 times and the consensus partition between the 10 runs is computed. Each cluster

is then assigned keywords to roughly represent the content and themes of the articles within it (for more

details see Fig. S2, Fig. S3 and Table S3, with related section). Keywords are assigned by looking at the

most frequent words in the cluster, the most signiﬁcant topics for the cluster according to the normalized

mixture proportion [22], as well as the ﬁrst 5 papers in the cluster according to diﬀerent measures (see

SI Section 2.1 for more details). In the rest of this article, we will mainly refer to a cluster through the

representative keyword at hierarchical level 3 (capitalized).

We consider only the papers in our dataset that have a non-empty title and contain at least one

citation or reference to another paper in the dataset (42.7% of the initial dataset), as we are interested

in how the concept of (de)centralization evolved in the academic literature, and citations are the most

natural proxy for how knowledge is transferred. We use title texts, instead of abstracts, for various

reasons: ﬁrstly, because the title is more frequently available than the abstract (see Table S1 in the SI);

3

secondly, because the title has the advantage of being more distilled compared to abstracts [23]; lastly,

because titles contain a signiﬁcantly smaller number of words than abstracts, allowing us to obtain a text

layer similar to the document layer in terms of number of edges by simply cutting out words present in

less than 5 documents. It is indeed well known that the hSBM performs optimally when both layers have

roughly the same size, otherwise the smaller layer is eﬀectively ignored by the algorithm [22]. This results

in a hierarchically clustered multilayer network, consisting of 181,605 documents and 15,381 diﬀerent

words, summing up to 590,215 citation links between documents and 1,396,830 document-to-word links.

Step 3: Knowledge ﬂows

In the third step of the pipeline, we want to better understand how the diﬀerent groups of documents

identiﬁed by the hSBM have inﬂuenced each other throughout history. To do so, we evaluate the

knowledge ﬂows between these groups, using article citations as proxy [24]. The goal is to compute
the ﬂow of knowledge from one cluster a in one year Ya to another cluster b in a future year Yb. The
computation takes into account the fraction of citations from papers in b published in the year Yb towards
papers in a of the year Ya with respect to all citations towards a in Ya from papers published in Yb, as
well as the overall fraction of papers of a in Ya. The citation network suﬀers indeed from a series of
inherent biases: ﬁeld size, typical number of citations in a ﬁeld or a journal, typical number of references,

age of the ﬁelds etc. This method de facto considers the number of citations with respect to a null model,

resulting in a link weight which is eﬀectively a z-score.

Mathematically, if a collection of papers is divided in a partition P of clusters such that diﬀerent

clusters do not overlap and altogether form the collection of papers, then we can deﬁne the knowledge
ﬂow units from papers in cluster a published in year Ya to papers in cluster b in a future year Yb by
counting how many citations have occurred from b to a in the two years, that is:

Ca→b(Ya, Yb) = |{(x, y) : x ∈ a, Yx = Ya, y ∈ b, Yy = Yb s.t. y cites x}|.

(1)

As said before, we need to normalize this number with respect to a null model, so as to keep into account

diﬀerent sizes of clusters and diﬀerent norms in citation practices. Hence, a normalized knowledge ﬂow
Ka→b(Ya, Yb) from a in year Ya to b in year Yb can be computed in the following way:

Ka→b(Ya, Yb) =




1 if

Ca→b(Ya, Yb)
c∈P Cc→b(Ya, Yb)

(cid:80)


0

otherwise

(cid:30) |x ∈ a : Yx = Ya|

(cid:80)

c∈P |x ∈ c : Yx = Ya|

≥ 1

,

(2)

After these normalizations, knowledge ﬂows can be treated as z-scores. Hence, we consider a knowledge

ﬂow as signiﬁcant (i.e., a binary value of 1) if higher than the threshold 1, and as not signiﬁcant (i.e., 0)

otherwise. Therefore, we obtain a binary value for each pair of clusters and each pair of years.

The collection of (knowledge ﬂow) links between all pairs of clusters and years, generates a temporal

network of clusters, which we aggregate in diﬀerent ways to facilitate the analysis. In particular, we
consider the average knowledge ﬂow Ka→b(Ya) from a cluster a to another b from a speciﬁc year Ya as
the average of the binary knowledge ﬂows from cluster a to b from year Ya to all years Yb > Ya, taking
into account only years Yb where there is at least one publication in b. Formally, this reads:

Ka→b(Ya) = Ka→b(Ya, •) = (cid:104)Ka→b(Ya, Yb)(cid:105){Yb > Ya : ∃x ∈ b s.t. Yx = Yb} .

(3)

4

This value represents, on a scale from 0 to 1, how much publications in cluster a in year Ya have inﬂuenced
the future of cluster b. Analogously, we deﬁne the average knowledge ﬂow from cluster a to cluster b

from a period of time T to the future, by averaging over all years Y in T in which there is at least one
publication in a as Ka→b(T ) = (cid:104)Ka→b(Y )(cid:105)Y ∈T , that is

Ka→b(T ) = (cid:104)Ka→b(Ya)(cid:105){Ya ∈ T : ∃x ∈ a s.t. Yx = Ya} .

(4)

We can also measure the average inﬂuence in terms of knowledge ﬂows from a cluster to all other

clusters and vice-versa, as well as the average knowledge ﬂow among all clusters, respectively as follows:

Ka→•(Y ) = (cid:104)Ka→b(Y )(cid:105)b , K•→a(Y ) = (cid:104)Kb→a(Y )(cid:105)b , K•→•(Y ) = (cid:104)Ka→b(Y )(cid:105)a,b .

(5)

Here, Ka→•(Y ) refers to the average inﬂuence from papers in cluster a published in year Y towards all
clusters in the future. On the opposite, K•→a(Y ) refers to the average inﬂuence of the papers in all
clusters in the year Y towards the future of cluster a. Finally, K•→•(Y ) refers to the average inﬂuence
(towards the future) of all papers published in year Y .

Results

The decentralized evolution of (de)centralization

We start by analysing the number of papers mentioning (see The pipeline section for more details)

(de)centralization over the years, comparing it to the total number of academic outputs (papers, books

etc.) produced in time, which is known to be exponentially increasing [25]. As shown in Fig. 1(a),

the fraction of papers mentioning (de)centralization has been exponentially increasing in time since the

1950s, rising to around 1 paper every 315 in 2021. The growing interest in this topic is also reﬂected by

the increasing number of authors involved in such academic research. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the

fraction of authors producing such research has risen exponentially by more than one order of magnitude,

with almost one academic every 154 writing a paper mentioning the topic in 2021. This growth is also

seen in terms of raw number of publications and authors, as shown in Fig. S1 in SI, where we compare

these numbers for the S2AG corpus and the (de)centralization dataset and ﬁnd a stronger exponential

rise for the latter. Notice that for both papers and authors there are some periods with a higher or lower

increase in the fraction, showing spikes of interest at particular times. For example, in Fig. 1(a,b) we

can see that between the 1960s and 1980s the growth rate was faster than the overall exponential ﬁt.

In order to understand what has characterized the origins and evolution of the topic, we set to identify
topics and clusters of papers in the dataset by using the hSBM algorithm previously described [21, 22].

In the following analysis, we focus our attention only to years after 1950. Before this date there are

only around 100 papers in our dataset. The very ﬁrst is a political science one from 1851 on local self-

government versus centralized government [26]. Among the others in this period, there are around 50

papers that relate to (de)centralization in governments, organizations and states. Other 30 papers are

actually false positives of the selection process. The small number of papers before 1950 is probably due

to issues of digitalization. The reliability and coverage of the ﬁrst 99 years of the data are unclear and

we opted to exclude them from the analysis.

As shown in Fig. 1(c) the hSBM identiﬁed 7 hierarchical levels of clusters of documents. On the left,

5

we draw the hierarchy until the 3rd level (starting from the common root at level 0) for visualization
clarity. We also show the heatmap of the number of papers in time for each cluster at the 3rd level, for
a total of 16 diﬀerent clusters. The keywords shown in the heatmap have been manually assigned to

roughly characterize each cluster. The keywords between parentheses have been chosen amongst the most
frequent and most signiﬁcant in the clusters at the 4th level, while the most representative keyword at
the 3rd level has been chosen and printed in bold. For details on how they were assigned see The pipeline
section and the Sec. S2 in the SI. In the following, we refer to a cluster at the 3rd level by its representative
keyword. As shown by the hierarchy and by the horizontal red lines in the heatmap, clusters are divided

in three main branches. Looking at the two biggest branches, we can see a clear division between

more STEM oriented documents (top branch) and those in Political science, Social science, as well as

Medicine (bottom branch). Notably, a third smaller branch, including papers mostly about Wireless

technologies technologies and applications, appears isolated with documents at the intersection of the

other two. Going into more details, in the STEM branch we notice how Cybersecurity, Control theory
and Telecommunication (clusters 1, 6, and 10 respectively) are the ones producing most publications,

with Blockchain (cluster 3) becoming the most relevant in the last 5 years in terms of number of papers

published per year. On the other branch, the Governance cluster (cluster 12) is the most relevant.

It includes works in Political science, Education and Fiscal federalism, while the Environment, Social

network analysis and Health literature clusters (clusters 13, 14, and 15 respectively) have produced a
smaller number of papers. See Fig. S4 and Fig. S5 in the SI respectively for a similar plot done at the 4th
level and for a bipartite hierarchical network showing how clusters are represented in the various topics.

In Fig. 1(c) we show how the number of papers in each of these clusters has evolved over time. The ﬁrst

papers adopting the term have all been in the Social sciences branch, most importantly the Governance

cluster, followed by the Social network analysis and Health domains. In the 1950s, indeed, there are

58 papers in Governance, which represents the ﬁrst cluster to adopt the term and use it extensively.

Some of these articles refer, among other things, to democracy as a form of centralized decision-making

system [27]. Other clusters with more than 10 papers refer to social network analysis and health, as seen

for example in Kaufman’s ”Toward an interactional conception of community” [28]. Here, centralization

is depicted as a force gradually destroying the concept of community as a social unit. Notably, most

of these papers have no citations from other articles in the full corpus, with only some citations within

the cluster of governance. In the 1960s, the largest growth is found again in the Governance and Health

clusters, both reaching around 150 papers each in the decade. An important example of the former

is that of Bachrach et al. [29], where they highlight how diﬀerent disciplines (i.e., social and political

science) reach completely opposite conclusions about the (de)centralization of power. (De)centralization

also appears in other relevant clusters, namely social network analysis (50 papers) and investments (29

papers) that show signiﬁcant citations in both directions between the two coming from papers in the same

decade. The term is picked up from the STEM branch only later in the 1970s, especially through works

in Control theory and Optimization [30], coming signiﬁcantly to a popular domain as Cybersecurity only

in the 1980s.

We have seen how diﬀerent domains have picked up the concept of (de)centralization at diﬀerent times.

It is therefore natural to ask whether they developed such uses separately, or they inﬂuenced each other

in some way. The hierarchical clustering partially answers this question, as it gives a degree of separation

between domains based on citation and semantic information. However, signiﬁcant information is still

present in the citations between papers of diﬀerent clusters. We exploit this by using the methodology

of knowledge ﬂows [24], whose aim is to quantify the ﬂow of knowledge given by the citations between

groups of papers through a comparison with a null model (for more details see The pipeline Section).
Here, we use the average knowledge ﬂow Ka→b(T ) from papers in a cluster a in a period of time T to
future publications in another cluster b, represented by a number between 0 and 1 showing how signiﬁcant

this inﬂuence has been.

In Fig. 2, we use the average knowledge ﬂow to study how the clusters, at level 3 of the hierarchy,

have inﬂuenced each other in three diﬀerent periods of time: 1970-1989, 1990-2007 and 2008-2021. In

the ﬁgure, all clusters are ordered as in Fig. 1(c), with the representative keywords shown in the legend

below. The color of the cell of row i and column j of the heatmap refers to the average knowledge ﬂow

from papers in cluster i in that period of time to future papers in cluster j, according to the colormap

shown below. As seen in Fig. 2(a), between 1970 and 1989 clusters have little to no inﬂuence on the

future of the other ones. We previously saw how in these years the use of (de)centralization started to

rise across some domains, mostly being Governance, Control theory, Social network analysis, Health,

Cybersecurity, and Investments. However, apart from Governance and Control theory (clusters 12 and

6), these clusters have low knowledge ﬂow even to themselves, meaning that the use of (de)centralization

was only relegated to sporadic and not so inﬂuential papers in the literature. This also shows how the

keyword for each cluster is reported on the bottom right part of the ﬁgure. White lines denote clusters
belonging to the same 2nd level cluster, whereas red lines mark diﬀerent branches at the 1st level. In the
ﬁrst period, little to no communication is happening between diﬀerent clusters. In recent years, more
communication happens inside the same 2nd level cluster, and towards the middle branch (cluster 11).
However, little communication happens between the two other branches, roughly representing the STEM
and social sciences communities respectively.

topic has appeared independently at this early stage. In Fig. 2(b) instead, we can see how much more

transfer of knowledge has occurred between clusters from 1990 and 2007. As shown in Fig. 2(c), this trend

is even more pronounced in recent years which notably coincide with the creation and rise of blockchain

technologies. Interestingly, these transfers reﬂect the structure of the hierarchy and denote signiﬁcant

diﬀerence between high-level domains. The STEM branch shows clear communication between clusters
belonging to the same group both at the 2nd and 1st level, whereas the other right bottom branch
shows almost no communication with the other domains, especially after 2008. The only signiﬁcant

knowledge ﬂow from this branch in the middle period goes from Environment (number 13 in the ﬁgure)

to Optimization (5), while in the last period this is only relegated between Environment and Smart grids

(2). The middle branch instead shows clear inﬂuence from the other two, and little inﬂuence towards
them, especially in the last period. Moreover, notice how the highest knowledge ﬂows between diﬀerent

clusters in Fig. 2(b) are from those that, in the ﬁrst period, were starting to be more inﬂuential while,

in the last period, it is relegated mostly to just STEM clusters. Put together, the heatmaps show a

clear decentralized birth of the concept of (de)centralization, born in diﬀerent ﬁelds and domains with

little communication between each other. Instead, in recent years, we ﬁnd a more coordinated evolution,

even though still sectorial in some cases, and mainly lead by STEM related clusters, in particular those

related to Blockchain (the ﬁrst 5 clusters in the ﬁgure).

The case of Governance and Blockchain

Having analyzed the concept of (de)centralization in the general academic landscape, we now focus on

two of the most important clusters in the history of this topic: Governance and Blockchain. As shown

8

in Fig. 1(c) and in Fig. S6(b) in the SI, these two clusters are among the biggest across time in terms

of number of papers. The Governance cluster has always been ﬁrst or second with respect to the other
clusters at the 3rd level, while Blockchain was barely present before 2008, the year of the bitcoin white
paper [4]. After that, Blockchain gradually increased in size and had an exponential explosion after 2015,

coincidentally with the increasing hype around the technology and its applications such as bitcoin and

ethereum [31, 32, 33]. It become the most productive cluster since 2019, surpassing governance.

To better understand their role in the evolution of the literature on (de)centralizations, we consider
the average knowledge ﬂows between clusters for each year, that is looking at Ka→•(Y ), K•→a(Y ), and
K•→•(Y ), deﬁned in Eq. (5). In Fig. 3 we rank clusters year by year using Ka→•(Y ) in (a) and K•→a(Y )
in (b). From these plots we can see how, on the one hand, Governance has been in the top ranks until

the late 1980s, both as a source and target of knowledge ﬂows. However, in the early 1990s it started to

decrease in importance, reaching the bottom ranks in the 2000s, despite being the ﬁrst cluster in terms
of number of papers in all this time. On the other hand, in Fig. 3(a) we notice that the rise of Blockchain

started only in 2010, being almost always outside of the (de)centralization literature discussion until

this point. Then, very sharply, the cluster of Blockchain becomes the ﬁrst to inﬂuence other clusters in

2013, maintaining its position in the following years. Hence, the literature on Blockchain has been key

in the development of the (de)centralization discussion in the most recent years. Moreover, looking at

Blockchain in Fig. 3(b), papers of other clusters before early 2000s have had almost no impact on the

scientiﬁc future of Blockchain. Interestingly, it has a received a lot of inﬂuence from publications between

2006 and 2012, that is when the blockchain and bitcoin originated [4], as well as after 2017, mostly due

to the increasing amount of applications using blockchain in the most diverse contexts in recent years.

Finally, notice the loss of inﬂuence on Blockchain from papers between 2013 and 2016.

These results are corroborated by the time evolution of the average knowledge ﬂow compared to the
overall average K•→•(Ya). Indeed in Fig. S7 we show how Governance has been increasingly important in
inﬂuencing other clusters until the 1980s, while since the 1990s it has had a lower average knowledge ﬂow

recent literature on (de)centralization, supplanting the governance cluster, highlighted in red.

Similarly to what shown by the ranks, after 2013 the Blockchain

starts to have a much higher inﬂuence towards the other clusters compared to the average.

We have seen how inﬂuential Governance has been in the early literature about (de)centralization,

and how Blockchain has risen in recent years as the most important inﬂuential cluster, contributing

in terms of knowledge ﬂow towards other branches of literature. It is therefore a natural next step to

investigate in more details which were the main clusters inﬂuenced by Governance ﬁrst and Blockchain

then, both as a source and as a target of knowledge ﬂow, and see how these these interactions changed

over time. We start this analysis from the more recent case of Blockchain. This cluster started to appear

only around 2008 with the bitcoin whitepaper [4]. Moreover, we notice a decrease in the inﬂuence on

this cluster in mid 2010s. We therefore divide the 2008–2021 time span in three parts, following the

blockchain history: 2008–2014, representing the origin of blockchain applications before the advent of
ethereum; 2015–2018, when the ﬁeld got more recognition thanks to ethereum and bitcoin; and the

ﬁnal 2019–2021 period, in which we have seen the explosion of academic literature production and the

widespread success of multiple applications such as DeFi, NFTs and the metaverse.

In Fig. 4 we plot, in a decreasing order, which clusters have been most inﬂuenced by (a) and have

most inﬂuenced (b) Blockchain during the three periods. To this end, we use a Sankey diagram, showing

how the overall picture has changed in the three diﬀerent phases. The plot is done using the average
knowledge ﬂows Ka→b(T ), where T is the selected period, while a and b are respectively ﬁxed to the
blockchain in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b). As we can see important diﬀerences across the three periods. First,

as shown by Fig. 4(a), the early literature of Blockchain has had a big impact on most of the clusters.

Indeed, there are few cases where the average knowledge ﬂow from the blockchain cluster a to a cluster
b is Ka→b(T ) = 0, shown by a circle in the respective node b. We also notice that Cybersecurity, Smart
grids, Edge-computing, Wireless technologies, and Federated learning had a very signiﬁcant average
knowledge ﬂow from Blockchain, i.e., Ka→b(T ) > 0.1, shown by the double stars. Notice how Blockchain
has continued to have a big impact on these last topics, which is not the case for the other clusters. In

particular, papers in the last 3 years in Blockchain have had an impact on the future only of Smart grids

and Wireless technologies, and a little to Cybersecurity as well, while no signiﬁcant knowledge ﬂow to

the other clusters, which is peculiar if we consider that Federated learning and Edge-computing received

a very signiﬁcant knowledge ﬂow in the previous years. We argue that the decrease in knowledge ﬂow

from Blockchain to other clusters in this period is mostly due to the time needed for a paper to attract

citations, especially outside its own cluster. Looking at all three periods, notice also how Cybersecurity

and Edge-computing lost some knowledge ﬂow from Blockchain over time, while Smart grids and Wireless

technologies became more reliant on Blockchain with respect to the other clusters. Moreover, we ﬁnd that

some clusters, such as Health, Electricity, Control theory and Governance, have received no signiﬁcant

inﬂuence from Blockchain, even if, Governance, for example, has been second only to Blockchain in

terms of number of papers. When looking at Fig. 4(b), we can see how over the years, more and more

clusters have had a strong and signiﬁcant impact on the future Blockchain literature.

In particular,

Cybersecurity, which has been one of the clusters that grew the most among all STEM clusters from the
1980s to the 2010s, has been stably the most inﬂuential cluster on Blockchain. The other top positions

have instead changed from the ﬁrst period considered, with Smart grids, which did not even have any

inﬂuence on Blockchain at ﬁrst, and Social network analysis becoming the next most important clusters.

Notice also how Robot swarms and Investments have experienced an increase in knowledge ﬂow towards

Blockchain, while the opposite has happened for Telecommunication, Optimization, Governance and

Health. Comparing the two plots, we ﬁnd that some top inﬂuenced clusters have not been as much

ﬂows Ka→b(T ), where T is the selected period, and a is ﬁxed to be Blockchain. (b) Change in the ranking

inﬂuential for Blockchain. Apart from the Cybersecurity example, the cluster of Social network analysis,

third in position since 2015 to inﬂuence Blockchain, has not been inﬂuenced by it, which is also the

case of Robot swarms. A similar situation is found for Wireless technologies, that has been strongly

inﬂuenced by Blockchain over time, but only in recent years it has had a small impact on it.

We have conducted a similar analysis on the Governance cluster in Fig. S8 in SI. In this case, we
consider three diﬀerent periods of times: 1950–1980, that is the early stage when it was the most

important cluster; 1981-1990, when the amount of knowledge ﬂow from Governance stopped to increase,

still remaining among the top in terms of ranking; and 1991–2000, in which its role diminished and

got surpassed by almost all other clusters by the end of the period. We do not ﬁnd many noticeable

diﬀerences between the ﬁrst two periods, and most clusters have no signiﬁcant knowledge ﬂow from

and to Governance, showing how (de)centralization developed independently in this cluster at ﬁrst.

Diﬀerently from Blockchain, the top clusters to have interactions with governance are Environment,

Social network analysis and Investments. Wireless technologies, Blockchain and Robot swarms have also

been inﬂuenced by Governance, but not vice-versa, apart from the sporadic case of Wireless technologies

in the middle period. We can see that the inﬂuence from Governance has increased over time on clusters

like Blockchain, Optimization and Robot swarms, showing how the last years of the last century have

been important milestones for the future of these clusters.

Discussion

In this paper we have analysed how diﬀerent topics have risen in the (de)centralization literature and have

inﬂuenced it. By exploiting the S2AG corpus, we have shown that the literature on (de)centralization has

exponentially increased in the past 70 years, with an author in 154 contributing to articles on the topic

in 2021. Through the analysis of the evolution of knowledge ﬂows between clusters, we have revealed

that initially the diﬀerent ﬁelds have had only little communication with one another to increase cross-

pollinations over time, especially within STEM. Finally, we have shown how Governance has lost its

leading role in favour of Blockchain, which has been the most inﬂuential clusters in the last ten years of

the (de)centralization literature and has recently become the most productive one.

Importantly, the framework we have developed for our analysis is general and may be used to analyse

the history of any concept in the academic literature. Our pipeline relies on two key methods, the

hierarchical stochastic block model [22] and knowledge ﬂows [24]. On the one hand, we employ the

ﬁrst one to cluster documents and words in the dataset to identify diﬀerent themes and topics, using

information of both citations between documents and of the words used in each document. On the other

hand, knowledge ﬂows allow us to identify signiﬁcant inﬂuences between clusters over time. With the

present paper, we publicly release the pipeline code to allow other researchers to perform similar analyses
on other concepts.

Our study presents some limitations which also represent directions for future work. First, we only

consider academic papers that directly mention the word (de)centralization or one of its variants (e.g.

“centralised”, “centralizing”, etc.). A broadened analysis could include also all articles cited by these

papers, in order to further understand the roots of this topic in the diﬀerent ﬁelds. Moreover, we have

limited the semantic information to the document titles. Future studies could build on state of the art

large scale language models and Natural Language Processing techniques to extract more information

from the articles text (i.e., abstract and/or full text) and oﬀer more detailed insights of their content.

Finally, our methodology is able to identify direct ﬂows of knowledge between two ﬁelds but misses less

straightforward chains of interaction (e.g., ﬁeld a inﬂuencing ﬁeld b, which in turn inﬂuences ﬁeld c, hence

providing an indirect impact of a to c). The inclusion of temporally and causally compatible higher order

interactions (i.e., more than pairwise) is therefore an obvious route to improve on the current work.

Overall, our work provides new insights in the origin and evolution of the ubiquitous concept of

(de)centralization, sheds light on the academic roots and inﬂuence of the blockchain technology, and

oﬀers a pipeline to analyse quantitatively any other concept in the academic literature. We therefore

anticipate that our results will be of interest to researchers working in a vast array of disciplines.

S1 Dataset

In this section we report additional information on the S2AG corpus and the (de)centralization dataset

to complement the description in the article.

In Table S1 we report the number of publications in

our dataset containing information about each attribute.

In Table S2 we report information on the

publications’ ﬁelds of study, as originally reported in the S2AG metadata. Each item can be classiﬁed

in one or more ﬁelds. In the left table, we report all single ﬁelds or pairs that have more than 1000

documents in our dataset (papers can be classiﬁed in more than two ﬁelds, but the ﬁelds after the second

are here discarded). In the right table we instead see how many papers have each of the 19 ﬁelds as

ﬁrst ﬁeld in their classiﬁcation, showing the predominance of Computer Science, and STEM subjects in

general, in our dataset. Finally, in Fig. S1 we show the raw number of papers and authors for the full

S2AG corpus, compared with the (de)centralization dataset, showing how (de)centralization has a faster

exponential growth than the general academic literature as indexed by semantic scholar, as the diﬀerent

exponent of the ﬁtted exponential functions clearly show.

S2 Hierarchical clustering

S2.1 Keywords annotation

As detailed in the main text, the hSBM algorithm produces a hierarchical clustering of both articles and

words (i.e. topics). Here we give more details on the procedure we used to manually assign keywords to

represent the diﬀerent document clusters. First, for each cluster at level 4, we manually inspect the most

frequent words in the publications’ titles. We then look at the most signiﬁcant topics represented in the

articles, as quantiﬁed by the normalized mixture proportion [22]. For instance, as we can see depicted

in Fig. S2(b) for the blockchain cluster, or in Fig. S3(b) for the governance cluster, we can visualize

the hierarchical tree of topics, highlighting the top 10 most signiﬁcant ones. We have also reported in

the tree the signiﬁcance level (> 1) with the * symbol. Moreover, for each of these topic, the top 20

most signiﬁcant words are printed. Then, we also look at the ﬁelds of study represented in each cluster

in time, as shown in Fig. S2(a) for the blockchain cluster, or in Fig. S3(a) for the governance cluster.

Finally, we look at the most important articles in the cluster, as represented by diﬀerent metrics: overall

number of citations, number of citations within the (de)centralization dataset, highest knowledge ﬂows

towards other clusters, and most central publications according to diﬀerent network centrality measures

(degree, pagerank, betweenness, closeness, katz).

For clarity, we have then chosen one representative keyword for each cluster at the 3rd level.
Table S3, we show the results of the keyword annotation procedure. Starting from the leftmost column,

In

we show each cluster at level 3 with its representative keyword and the number of publications in the

cluster, to then show the annotated keywords in each cluster at level 4 (and the number of publications)

present in its hierarchical branch in separate rows.

S2.2 Results of the hSBM

In this section we report some additional visualizations of the results of the hSBM algorithm on the

(de)centralization dataset. In Fig. S4 we show the number of papers in each cluster at hierarchical level

4, together with the hierarchical tree and the manually annotated keywords. In Fig. S5 we show the

bipartite network of documents and words, together with the results of the hSBM algorithm and the

manual annotation procedure. This ﬁgure shows how the various clusters are represented in terms of

topic frequency. Nodes on the left represent documents, while those on the right title words. Links are

colored based on the doc cluster they start from. On top of the bipartite network between docs and

words, we show a tree where squares represent clusters/topics at various hierarchical levels as a result of

the hSBM, starting from the common root to level 3.

they start from. Multiple instances of the same word is considered, one for each document it is in. Word
nodes within a topic at level 3 are ordered as the document clusters for visualization purposes. On top
of the bipartite network, the hierarchy of topics and document clusters are represented on the word and
document side respectively, shown as a network of square gray nodes. On the bottom of the ﬁgure, the
legend of topic words is also shown for clarity with the 10 most frequent words of the topic.

of (de)centralization

In this section we report some additional and complementary plots to show the importance of the

blockchain and governance clusters in the academic literature on (de)centralization. In Fig. S6(a) we

show the number of papers in time for three groups of documents: the blockchain cluster, the governance

cluster and the whole dataset. Similarly, in Fig. S6(b) we plot the rank of each cluster in terms of yearly

number of papers, highlighting the blockchain and governance clusters. Both ﬁgures clearly show how

governance has been the most productive cluster in the literature for a long time, only to be replaced by

blockchain in recent years.

In Fig. S7 we look instead at knowledge ﬂows, plotting their value instead of their rank (as done
in Fig. 3 in the main text). We plot the time evolution of Ka→•(Ya), where a is the governance or
the blockchain cluster, in comparison to K•→•(Ya) in Fig. S7(a). This shows the average inﬂuence that
the cluster in a certain year has towards the other clusters in the future. We similarly compare the
average inﬂuence of all other clusters on these two clusters looking at K•→a(Ya) in Fig. S7(b). We can
see from these ﬁgures how governance has been increasingly important in inﬂuencing other clusters until

the 1980s, while since after the 1990s it has had a lower average knowledge ﬂow than the average among
all clusters, despite being the ﬁrst cluster in terms of number of papers in all this time. The case of

blockchain is opposite: after 2013 it starts to have a much higher inﬂuence towards the other clusters

compared to the average one over all clusters, while the other clusters after 2004 have had an average

knowledge ﬂow towards it.

Figure S6: Blockchain and Governance are the most productive clusters. (a) Number of papers
in time for the blockchain cluster, governance cluster and the full dataset. (b) Rank by number or papers
in time for diﬀerent clusters, highlighting the blockchain and governance clusters. Both plots show the
central role of both clusters in the literature on (de)centralization, and how they have exchanged roles
with blockchain becoming the most productive ﬁeld in recent years.

Inﬂuence of governance from and on other clusters

Here we report an additional plot looking at the role of the governance cluster with respect to the

other clusters.

In particular, we replicate Fig. 4 in the main text for the governance cluster instead

of the blockchain one. Given the results on the predominant role of governance as an inﬂuence on

other clusters before the year 2000, we look at the following three periods of time: from 1950 to 1980,

from 1981 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2000, highlighting diﬀerent interactions with other clusters both in

terms of source and destination of knowledge ﬂows. For instance, the blockchain cluster is the second

most inﬂuenced cluster by governance in the 1990s, highlighting its role in the foundations of the ﬁeld.

However, the rankings are generally more stable than what observed in Fig. 4 in the main text for the

case of the blockchain cluster.

(a) Change of the ranking of the clusters most inﬂuenced by the
governance literature between its early period (1950-1980), its middle period (1981-1990), and its late
period (1991-2000), calculate using the average knowledge ﬂows Ka→b(T ), where T is the selected period,
and a is ﬁxed to governance. (b) Change of the ranking of the most inﬂuential clusters on the gover-
nance literature between its early period (1950-1980), its middle period (1981-1990), and its late period
(1991-2000), calculate using the average knowledge ﬂows Ka→b(T ), where T is the selected period, and b
is ﬁxed to governance. In both cases, if Ka→b(T ) = 0, we print a circle in the corresponding gray node.
Moreover, we print a star when Ka→b(T ) > 0.01, and two stars when Ka→b(T ) > 0.1.
