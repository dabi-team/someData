Abstract—This paper considers an Internet of Thing (IoT)
blockchain network consisting of a leader node and various
follower nodes which together implement the RAFT consensus
protocol to verify a blockchain transaction, as requested by a
blockchain client. Further, two kinds of active attacks, i.e., jam-
ming and impersonation, are considered on the IoT blockchain
network due to the presence of multiple active malicious nodes in
the close vicinity. When the IoT network is under the jamming
attack, we utilize the stochastic geometry tool to derive the closed-
form expressions for the coverage probabilities for both uplink
and downlink IoT transmissions. On the other hand, when the
IoT network is under the impersonation attack, we propose a
novel method that enables a receive IoT node to exploit the
pathloss of a transmit IoT node as its ﬁngerprint to implement
a binary hypothesis test for transmit node identiﬁcation. To this
end, we also provide the closed-form expressions for the prob-
abilities of false alarm, missed detection and miss-classiﬁcation.
Finally, we present detailed simulation results that indicate the
following: i) the coverage probability improves as the jammers’
locations move away from the IoT network, ii) the three error
probabilities decrease as a function of the link quality.

I. INTRODUCTION

The next generation wireless networks are supposed to
have support for processing at
the edge, automation and
distributed trust, which can be accomplished using blockchain
enabled wireless networks [1]. Blockchain technology has
great capability in wireless networks (speciﬁcally, Internet of
thing (IoT) devices) for developing trust and consensus proce-
dures without the intervention of central party [2]. Recently,
some prominent works are reported in the literature studying
blockchain based wireless networks. For the ﬁrst time, Y.Sun
in [3] study the wirelessly connected blockcahin system where
he provides optimal nodes deployment, and a relation of com-
munication and transaction throughput. Further, the work [4]
studies the security aspects of RAFT based wireless networks
with the presence of single jammer and derive the probability
of achieving successful blockchain transactions via exploiting
probability theory. Next, authors in [5] maximize the transac-
tion uploading and revenue of miners using Stackelberg game
approach in blockchain based wireless networks. Following
[4], authors in [6] provide theoretical calculation of required

throughput and transmission successful probability to support
the system. Further Hao in his perspective article [7] discusses
the potentials of blockchain for resource management
in
6G. Particularly, he discusses device to device, IoT, network
slicing applications of 6G for resource management. More
recently, [8] answer the question that how much resources are
needed to run a wireless blockchain networks. Particularly,
the impact of provision of resources is studied on the perfor-
mance of blockchain. Dynamic spectrum sharing is studied
in [9], where reinforcement learning is utilized to analyze
the resource sharing structure and spectrum sharing process
in blockchain system combined with 6G hybrid cloud. Next,
the authors in [10] study the block propagation in blochchain
based vehicular ad-hoc networks. They study the dynamic
of block propagation and provide a closed-form expression
for block propagation time. The work [11] minimize the
latency in storing data by intelligent transaction migration
policy by exploiting Markov process and deep deterministic
policy gradient. The authors in [12] focus blochchain based
wireless local area network and provide a new medium access
control protocol known as block access control. Speciﬁcally,
its design is studied with, modeling and analyses. Finally, the
authors in [13] propose Blockchain Enabled Radio Access
Network (BE-RAN). They provide a security framework for
mutual authentication based on digital signatures/secret keys.
They also provide design guidelines for switching, routing and
quality of service management.

The ground basis of blockchain is the consensus techniques
that establish trust and update the ledger’s states which can be
broadly classiﬁed into two classes [14]. The ﬁrst class, which
is based on pure computation, solve the mathematical puzzle
by joining nodes of the blockchain network to prove that they
are eligible for mining work, e.g., Proof-of-Work (PoW) [15]
and Proof of Stacks (PoS) [16]. The second class relies on the
pure communications between joining nodes. The successful
voting of majority nodes through the communication channel
leads to the achievement of consensus, i.e. Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (BFT) [17], Paxos [18], and RAFT [19]. Private
blockchains use second class due to its low complex nature,
high throughput and small conﬁrmation delay [20]. Low
complex consensus techniques might be used in wirelessly
connected IoT devices to develop the distributed system with
the presence of unreliable nodes. In such network, blockchain

 
 
 
 
 
 
synchronization will fail if honest nodes did not cast their
votes due to communication failure or dishonest votes cast by
malicious actors [4].

Primary implementations of consensus in the private
blockchain were based on Paxos over the last decade. Un-
fortunately, it is not easy to understand due to its intricate ar-
chitecture, and aloof nature for practical systems. Therefore, a
new consensus protocol (so-called RAFT) was developed that
has a concise deﬁnition and comparable performance. RAFT
reduces the degree of non-determinism by decomposing the
nodes into two types of roles, one leader and the others are
followers. RAFT implements the consensus by ﬁrst electing
a leader that receives log entries/transaction details from the
client. The leader has the responsibility to manage the new log
entries and replicate them on the servers. In contrast, followers
are passive nodes that only respond to the request of the leader.
The leader can only be replicate the logs on servers when the
majority of followers successfully vote back to the leader [19].
Blockchain technology serves as securing different IoT
applications, but it also vulnerable to different attacks [21].
These attacks of the blockchain systems lead to the failure of
the consensus process responsible for verifying the transac-
tions in the blockchain.
This work studies two types of active malicious attacks:
jamming attacks and impersonation attacks in a RAFT based
blockchain system. The coverage probability is derived in
order to assess the impact of jamming in uplink and downlink
transmissions.
On the other hand, physical layer authentication to counter
impersonation attacks is an emerging domain in the ﬁeld of
information security [22]. Recently, to counter the imperson-
ation attacks at the physical layer, [23] and [24] propose
distance, angle of arrival and position, [25] and [26] propose
channel impulse response, and [27] exploits the lack of hard-
ware reciprocity as features or device ﬁngerprints to carried
out authentication. We in this work encountered impersonation
attacks by exploiting the pathloss of the transmitter nodes.

Contributions. This work considers a RAFT-based IoT
blockchain network that comprises a leader node and many
follower nodes which together verify a blockchain transaction
upon request from a blockchain client. To the best of authors’
knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst that considers two most
prominent kinds of active attacks (jamming and imperson-
ation) on the IoT blockchain networks. Speciﬁcally, two main
contributions of this paper are as follows:

● When the IoT blockchain network is under jamming
attack, we utilize the stochastic geometry tool to derive
the coverage probabilities for both uplink and downlink
IoT transmissions, as a function of important system pa-
rameters, e.g., transmit power of legitimate and jamming
nodes, intensity and relative geometry of the jamming
nodes, etc.

● When the IoT blockchain network is under impersonation
attack, we propose a novel counter-method that enables
a receive IoT node to exploit the pathloss of a transmit
IoT node as its ﬁngerprint to construct a two-step testing

approach (i.e. Maximum Likelihood test followed by
the binary hypothesis test). Furthermore, we provide
closed-form expressions for the three error probabilities
of interest, i.e., false alarm, missed detection and miss-
classiﬁcation.

Outline. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II provides a detailed description of the considered
system model. Section III considers the scenario of a jamming
attack on the IoT blockchain network, and derives the cover-
age probability for both uplink and downlink IoT transmis-
sions. Section IV considers the scenario of an impersonation
attack on the IoT blockchain network, and presents a novel
countermeasure that enables a receive IoT node to exploit
pathloss as ﬁngerprint of a transmit IoT node to implement
a hypothesis testing test for transmitter identiﬁcation. Section
V provides simulation results. Finally, Section VI concludes
the paper.

II. SYSTEM MODEL & BACKGROUND

A. System Model

The IoT blockchain network based on the RAFT consensus
algorithm comprises two parts, wireless consensus network
and IoT clients, as shown in Fig. 1. The two parts may or
may not be geographically isolated. The ﬁgure illustrates the
communication network topology and the IoT nodes’ roles
interchangeably in different business models. Any IoT node in
the network can play a client’s role that sends out transaction-
requests or a leader/follower in the consensus process. The
followers and malicious nodes locations in a 2-Dimensional

free space are modeled as Poisson Point Process (PPP) and
leader (full node) is ﬁxed at geo-center of consensus network.
We consider that malicious nodes are active malicious nodes
who are capable of launching jamming and impersonation at-
tacks. We assume that malicious nodes either launch jamming
attacks or impersonation attacks in a given time.

B. RAFT Consensus Protocol

RAFT consensus algorithm begins by ﬁrst electing a leader
who receives log entries/transaction-details from the client.
The leader has high capabilities such as better performance
and reliability to manage the new log entries and replicate
them into the blockchain. In contrast, followers are passive
nodes that only respond to the request of the leader. The leader
the transaction-details into the blockchain
can only insert
when most followers successfully vote back to the leader.
The RAFT consensus mechanism is triggered as follows.
Firstly, the leader receives the transaction information from
clients and performs some necessary actions to form a block.
Secondly, a leader will communicate with follower nodes via
a downlink (DL) broadcasting channel to approve the block.
When followers successfully received a DL message, they
verifying and send the voting message on the multi-access
uplink (UL) channel for conﬁrmation. Lastly, a leader will
count the vote to achieve consensus; if the leader gains the
majority more than 50% from the followers (voters).

This paper focuses on communication inside the consensus

network, on both DL and UL.

III. JAMMING ATTACK ON IOT BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK
In the RAFT consensus algorithm, a client

transmits
transaction-requests to the leader node to make a consent
with the followers by considering that all follower nodes are
honest. Therefore, the threat of failure among the nodes is
due to communication faults. Communication failure is due
to the opposing jammers that can exist in the network due
to the openness of the wireless channel. The leader would
lose the vote(follower) if communication links (DL or UL)
failed due to opposing jammers and channel fading. This
section ﬁnds success/coverage probability deﬁned as receiving
to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) is greater
Signal
than its predeﬁned threshold between a leader and associated
follower. All followers operate in the same frequency band, so
they cause increased interference that ultimately degrades the
received SINR and lowers the success probability. Different
protocols were employed in the private blockchain networks
to avoid interference and collision among the follower nodes,
such as centralized radio resource allocation and Carrier Sense
Multiple Access (CSMA) or transmission interval made large
enough so that collision is negligible.

A. Coverage Probability for IoT Transmissions on the Down-
link

When the leader transmits, then a typical follower receives

the following baseband signal:

√

y =

P Hs + ∑
j∈φJ

√

PjHjs + n,

(1)

√

√Rα

where P (Pj) is the transmit power of the leader (j-th
Rα
jammer) node, s is the transmitted symbol, H = h/
(Hj = hj/
j ) represents the wireless propagation from
leader (jammer) to the follower, and R (Rj) is the ran-
dom distance between the leader (jammer) and the follower
node. Further, for the leader-follower link, R−α is the large-
scale fading/pathloss component, α is the pathloss exponent,
h ∼ CN (0, 1) is the small-scale fading component. Moreover,
√
PjHjs is the aggregate interference amplitude
due to multiple jammers where φJ indicates that the jammers
are distributed in a 2-dimensional free-space as PPP. Finally,
n ∼ CN (0, σ2
) is the additive white Gaussian noise with
power σ2.

IJ = ∑j∈φJ

√

We consider an interference-limited scenario (i.e., the in-
terference is much larger than the noise). This allows us to
consider the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) as the perfor-
mance metric. The SIR of a typical follower associated with
the leader node is given as:

SIRDL

=

2R−α
P ∣h∣
IJ

,

(2)

−α is the aggregate interference
where IJ = ∑j∈φJ Pj∣hj∣
power, hj ∼ CN (0, 1) is the small-scale fading component on
the jammer-follower channel, and Xj is the random location
of j-th jammer or Poisson point (note that ∥Xj∥ = Rj).

∥Xj∥

The IoT transmission from the leader to any given follower
node on the DL will be considered successful only when the
received SIR is greater than a pre-speciﬁed threshold βD [28].
Thus, the transmission success probability, or, the coverage
probability for the DL (P

) is deﬁned as follows:

DL
c

DL
c

(α, βD) = P[SIRDL

P

(3)
Now, we assume that a typical follower is at distance r from
the leader, then the coverage probability can be expressed as:

DL

(α, βD) = ER[P[SIRDL

where fR(r) is the probability density function (PDF) of R,
and is given as [29] 1:

fR(r) = 2πρT r exp(−ρT πr2

),

(5)

where ρT is the intensity/density of the IoT nodes. At this
stage, ﬁrst we need to compute P[SIRDL

can be expressed as:

B. Coverage Probability for IoT Transmissions on the Uplink

To achieve the consensus, followers send the voting mes-
sage on the multi-access UL channel for conﬁrmation after
receiving a DL message. Consensus will be achieved if
more than 50% from the followers successfully verify the
transaction on the UL channel. So, we need to compute the
success probability on the UL channel. We assume that CSMA
is the medium access technique adopted by the followers and
transmissions on UL is available all the time (i.e., no idle
channel). Then the coverage probability for a typical follower
node on the UL is given as [28]:

Rα

(α, βU ) = P[SIRU L

where βU is a predeﬁned threshold for UL, hU is the channel
gain and RU is the distance from a typical follower to
the leader on UL, PF is the transmit power of a typical
follower, and I U
J is the aggregated interference to the leader.
CSMA makes sure no interference from the other follower
nodes on the UL and hence the interference/jamming is due
to the jammers only. This makes the coverage probability
formulation the same as we do for DL. We compute UL
success probability using the same procedure as above, we
get:

where ρJ is the intensity of jammer nodes and γU

Consensus is achieved when followers successfully receive
the leader’s request to verify the transaction-detail over the DL
channel and respond to the leader over the UL channel. So,
we derive the joint coverage probability in an IoT blockchain
network as follows [30]:

Pc = P[SIRU L

(11)

IV. IMPERSONATION ATTACK ON IOT BLOCKCHAIN
NETWORK

in this work exploit

In the RAFT consensus algorithm, due to broadcast nature
of wireless communication, the consensus algorithm may be
failed due to the impersonation attacks launched by nearby
malicious/illegitimate node(s) (so called Eve(s)). In the im-
personation attacks, malicious nodes try to claim themselves
as legitimate nodes/followers by utilizing a forged character
in order to destroy the consensus mechanism.
layer authentication
In this work, we provide a physical
mechanism to counter the impersonation by illegitimate nodes.
We,
the pathloss of the transmitter
node as device ﬁngerprint to counter the impersonation. We
assume a realization2 of PPP , speciﬁcally, M follower (le-
M
gitimate) nodes {Fi}
i=1 and N Eve (malicious/illegitimate)
N
nodes {Ej}
j=1 are considered in a 2-Dimensional space, and
a leader is placed at the center of the considered region.
We assume that the transmitter nodes transmit with a ﬁxed
transmit power so that the leader can compute the pathloss.
We also assume that the malicious nodes are transmitting with
the same transmit power in order to stay stealth in the region
3. The pathloss Ψ in dB of a transmitter at the distance d from
receiver is given as:

Ψ[dB] = 10α log10(d),

(12)

where α is the pathloss exponent.

A. The Proposed Authentication Method

We assume that CSMA is the approach used by the fol-
lowers and malicious nodes to cast their votes. We assume
that malicious node Ej could cast a vote, pretending to be
a legitimate follower node when the channel is completely
idle by the followers and hence, no collision. The leader
is supposed to authenticate each received casting vote and
correctly achieved the consensus. Furthermore, we assume that
the leader already have the ground truths of legitimate nodes
which he gets via prior training on a secure channel. The
T .
ground truth vector can be denoted by Ψ = {Ψ1, ..., ΨM }
As discussed earlier, we will authenticate the transmitter based

2Typically, in physical layer authentication, one needs to know the exact
number of transmitting nodes in order to evaluate its performance. Therefore,
in this part, we take a single realization of PPP in order to ﬁx the total number
of nodes (both, malicious and legitimate).

3High power transmission will easily identify the transmitter as malicious
node. To get success in impersonating the legitimated nodes, malicious nodes
transmit with same power as legitimate nodes do

on the pathloss feature. So the noisy measurement of pathloss
z = Ψ + n at a given time-slot is obtained by using the pulse-
based method, where Ψ is the pathloss and n ∼ N (0, σ2
) is
the noise/estimation error. To counter the impersonation by
malicious nodes, we ﬁrst do Maximum Likelihood (ML) test
as follows:

i∗

= max
i

f (z ∣ Ψi),

(13)

where f (z ∣ Ψi) is the likelihood function or conditional PDF.
Equivalently, we can write 13 as:

(T S∗, i∗

) = min

∣z − Ψi∣,

(14)

i
where T S∗ is the minimum value of test statistics amd
i∗ returns the index of transmitter node which is decided
through ML. Next, we decide for impersonation through
binary hypothesis testing as follow:

H0(no impersonation) ∶ T S∗
⎧⎪⎪⎪
⎨
T S∗
H1(impersonation) ∶
⎪⎪⎪⎩
where (cid:15) is a small test threshold and is a design parameter that
decides a vote from the node is accepted or not. Equivalently,
we have:

∣z(t) − Ψi∣ < (cid:15)
∣z(t) − Ψi∣ > (cid:15)

= min
i
= min

, (15)

T S∗

(cid:15).

(16)

H1
H0
The hypothesis H0 inferred that the legitimate node trans-
mits the vote. Alternatively, the hypothesis H1 implies that a
illegitimate node transmits a vote. Further, we present closed
form expressions for the error probabilities. We have three
types of errors resulted from the above tests. These errors
are: false alarm, missed detection and miss-classiﬁcation. The
probability of false alarm is the probability that a legitimate
follower casts a vote, but the leader notices it as illegitimate,
denoted as Pf a. The Probability of missed detection is the
probability that a impersonate node cast a vote, but the leader
considered it as a legitimate vote, denoted as Pmd. Last, the
probability of miss-calssiﬁcation is, when no impersonation is
detected but a wrong transmitter node is decided.

We, in this work follow the Neyman-Pearson lemma [31]
where (cid:15) test
threshold for a pre-deﬁned false alarm Pf a
can be chosen such that missed detection probability Pmd
the error probabilities for the above
is minimized. Thus,
hypothesis tests are:

Where π(i) is the prior probability of of legal node Fi

(20)

where we have assumed that the unknown pathloss Ψj ∼

Now, we investigate the authentication of the casted vote by
identifying transmitter identity using the ML based approach.
The error probability of miss-classiﬁed node Pmc resulting
from Eq. 14 is given as:

Pmc =

(21)

where Pmc∣i is the probability that leader notice that the vote
is casted by follower Fj but the vote is actualy casted by
follower Fi where i ≠ j. For the hypothesis test of (16), Pmc∣i
is given as:

Pmc∣i = 1 − (Q(

{
vector in an increasing order. For the boundary cases, e.g.,
i = 1, i = M , ˜Ψl,1 = Ψmin, ˜Ψl,M = Ψmax respectively.
Note that the proposed mechanism will be executed at the
leader node, which becomes uplink transmission according to
the discussion of Section III. For the downlink, the mechanism
will be executed at followers having a single ground truth
of the leader node. In this case, we will have two error
probabilities (i.e., false alarm and missed detection) with a
kind of similar error expressions given above (i.e., except
summation for N legitimate nodes). We omit the discussion
of it for the sake of brevity.

IMPORTANT SIMULATION PARAMETERS

A. Coverage probability performance of the IoT blockchain
network under jamming attack

Under jamming attack, both legitimate and malicious nodes
are deployed according to the PPP with ρT intensity for le-
gitimate nodes, and ρJ intensity for jammer/malicious nodes.
The leader is placed at the origin.

Fig. 2 presents the joint coverage probability for the differ-
ent SIR threshold values of β (in dB) and intensity of jammers
ρJ . We observe that the transaction success rate (i.e., Pc)
declines as the SIR threshold increases. Fig. 2 also reveals
that increasing the jammer intensity severely degrades the
transaction success rate.

Followers are deployed in π(500m)
jamming distance from the origin produces low DL coverage
probability as jammers are getting closed to followers. On the
other hand, joint coverage probability ﬁrst enhances and then
goes down. Note that we need coverage probabilities greater
than the 0.5 to achieve the consensus.

Fig. 3 demonstrates the behaviour of joint coverage prob-
ability against different radius values (i.e., effective area) of
distributed jammers. Speciﬁcally, we set ρT = ρJ , z1 = 0 and
vary z2 from 0 to 300 by step of 20. We observe that the
increase in the effective jamming area of jammers causes low
SIR values that lowers the transaction success rate. We can
also see the degradation in the performance of success rate
with increase in intensity of jammers ρJ .

Fig. 4 presents the three computed coverage probabilities:
UL, DL, and joints coverage probabilities against the jamming
distance (i.e., z1) from the origin or leader. We vary z1 from
0m to 300m and keep z2 = z1 + 50m. In the upper two plots,
the β vary from −30 dB to −20 dB from left to right, and
from −10 dB to 0 dB in the lower two plots. We notice that
the effective jamming area (or can be thought as jammers)

B. Authentication performance of the IoT blockchain network
under impersonation attack

We choose a realization of PPP for malicious and legitimate
nodes where we have M = N = 5 number of malicious
and legitimate nodes. We set the link quality as LQ = 1/σ2,
which means that more the uncertainty in the estimation/noise
implies poor link quality and vice versa. We plot the error
probabilities (false alarm, missed detection and miss classi-
ﬁcation) as functions of LQ (in dB) in Fig. 5. We observe
from this ﬁgure that pathloss can be exploited to counter
the impersonation attacks in wireless blockchains networks.
A designed parameter (cid:15) can be set for the desired level of
security. We observe that we can not minimize both errors for
a given link quality simultaneously. In other words, increasing
(cid:15) improves false alarm but degrades the missed detection. The
lower plot of Fig. 5 shows the miss classiﬁcation error against
link quality and it demonstrates that it is not a function of (cid:15),
and that’s why a single curve for all the three given choices
of (cid:15).

Figure 6 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curves comprises two error probabilities (Pd and Pf a).
where Pd = 1 − Pmd is the detection probability deﬁned as the

gerprint to construct a binary hypothesis test for transmit
node identiﬁcation. To this end, closed-form expressions were
provided for the probabilities of false alarm, missed detection
and miss classiﬁcation. Simulation results showed that for the
jamming attack, an increase in the threshold value reduces the
coverage probability and high intensity of jammers produces
low coverage probability, while for the impersonation attack,
pathloss can be used as device ﬁngerprint and above 95% of
detection probability can be achieved with minimum of 0.1
false alarm for a 10 dB link quality.

COMPUTATION OF LIJ (s) FOR IOT TRANSMISSION ON THE

The Laplace transform of the cumulative interference IJ is

deﬁned as:

LIJ (s) = EIJ [exp(−sIJ )],

Next, we use the property of exponential function that sum
of exponential powers is the product of exponentials and put
the value of s back in above expression to get:

LIJ (s) = Eφj ,{∣hj ∣2}[ ∏

Pf a from zero to one, and ﬁnd Pmd for different values of

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper studied active (jamming and impersonation)
attacks on a RAFT-based IoT blockchain network. The impact
of the jamming attack on the IoT blockchain network was
evaluated via coverage probability analysis for both uplink
and downlink IoT transmissions. On the other hand,
the
impersonation attack on the IoT blockchain network was
countered by means of a novel, physical-layer method that

LIJ (s) =

where ρJ is the intensity of jammer nodes, A is the effective
2D area where jammers signals are prominent or can affect
the transmissions. Now, converting x into polar form as x =
(rj, θ) (j subscript is used in order to differentiate it from the
earlier used r (distance of follower)), we have,
