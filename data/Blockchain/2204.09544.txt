Abstract-  Since  the  emergence  of  blockchain  technology,  its 
application in the financial market has always been an area of 
focus and exploration by all parties. With the characteristics of 
anonymity, trust, tamper-proof, etc., blockchain technology can 
effectively solve some problems faced by the financial market, 
such  as  trust  issues  and  information  asymmetry  issues.  To 
deeply understand the application scenarios of blockchain in the 
financial market, the issue of securities issuance and trading in 
the primary market is a problem that must be studied clearly. 
We  conducted  an  empirical  study  to  investigate  the  main 
difficulties  faced  by  primary  market  participants  in  their 
business practices and the potential challenges of the deepening 
application of blockchain technology in the primary market. We 
adopted  a  hybrid  method  combining  interviews  (qualitative 
methods)  and  surveys  (quantitative  methods)  to  conduct  this 
research in two stages. In the first stage, we interview 15 major 
primary  market  participants  with  different  backgrounds  and 
expertise.  In  the  second  phase,  we  conducted  a  verification 
survey  of  54  primary  market  practitioners  to  confirm  various 
insights  from  the  interviews,  including  challenges  and  desired 
improvements.  Our  interviews  and  survey  results  revealed 
several significant challenges facing blockchain applications in 
the  primary  market:  complex  due  diligence,  mismatch,  and 
difficult  monitoring.  On  this  basis,  we  believe  that  our  future 
research can focus on some aspects of these challenges.

INTRODUCTION  

The financial market can divide into primary market and 
secondary market [1]. The primary market is a market where 
companies conduct transactions before IPO. Stock and bonds 
have  not  undergone  a  standardized  review  process  before

* The correspondent author: jliu3872@uni.sydney.edu.au 

going to the public. Thus, there are many issues such as trust, 
authenticity, privacy,  and etc.  in  the  market.  The secondary 
market  is  a  market  for  stock/bond  trading  transactions  that 
have been standardized and reviewed by regulation. There are 
four  parts  in  the  transaction  chain  of  the  primary  market: 
raising funds, investing assets, asset monitor, and existence. 
There are financing  ƒappcompanies, investment institutions, 
brokers,  valuation  firms,  law  firms,  accounting  firms,  etc., 
participating  in  the  primary  market.  Each  participant  has  a 
unique purpose and role. These participants help the market to 
maintain stability. 

The primary financial market is enormous. The 'McKinsey 
Global  Private  Markets  Review  2020'  [2]  shows  that  total 
global private equity market transactions in 2019 plateaued at 
1.47  trillion  USD  versus  1.49  trillion  USD  in  2018. Before 
2019, the amount of global private equity market transactions 
has grown 12% annually from 2013 to 2018. 

As the primary market lacks standardization, information 
asymmetry, fraud, and high cost on due diligence have led to 
seriously fragmented ecosystems. Industry and academia have 
tried to change this status quo, but there is no noticeable effect. 
The  infrastructure  of  the  primary  financial  market  is  not so 
easy to optimize without solving the challenges listed. 

Since  Bitcoin  was  invented,  the  blockchain  technology 
which supports it has quickly entered people's eyes [3]. One 
of the essential purposes of the invention of blockchain was to 
develop the financial industry [4]. The decentralized idea and 
unique features of blockchain, such as decentralization, highly 
transparent,  enhanced 
immutability  of 
information,  make  blockchain  be  the  most  appropriated 
technology to along with the logic of financial markets [5]. 

security,  and 

To  help  advance  research  in  primary  financial  market 
infrastructure development, we conducted an empirical study 

 
 
 
 
 
 
to investigate the work practice and potential challenges faced 
by primary market involvers. We followed a blended strategy 
approach that combines interviews (qualitative method) and 
surveys (quantitative method). In particular, we interviewed a 
total  of  15  primary  financial 
involvers  with  various 
backgrounds and expertise. We asked participants about their 
everyday  work  and  relevant  challenges  faced  during  their 
responsibilities  in  the  primary  financial  market  during  the 
interviews. Next, we adopted open card sorting [6] to analyze 
the  interview  results.  The  following categories  produced by 
open  card  sorting  were  grouped  into  three  groups,  i.e., 
complex  due  diligence,  mismatching,  and  difficult 
monitoring. After that, we performed a validation survey with 
54  participants 
the 
interviews,  including  challenges,  best practices,  and  desired 
improvements based on the interviews. 

to  confirm  various 

insights  from 

According to the interview and survey, we realized that the 
primary market participants cared a lot about due diligence but 
did  not  effectively  avoid  the complex  process. Besides,  the 
asymmetric  information  and  lack  of  trust  among  the 
participants make it hard to settle. Also, it is hard to discover 
each  other,  which  makes  the  market  lack  liquidity.  The 
limitations influenced their day-by-day work, particularly for 
large companies. 

The  significant  contributions  of  our  research  are  as 

follows: 

•  As  far  as  we  know,  this  is  the  first  in-depth  research 
investigating  primary  market  participants'  insights  on  the 
current status of the primary financial market and blockchain 
technology through interviews and surveys.  

•  We  analyze  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  and 
highlight  potential  opportunities  and 
that 
investors,  financiers,  brokers,  and  other  financial  market 
participants can use to improve their daily work under a new 
infrastructure in the future.  

implications 

The following sections are organized as below: In the next 
section, we provide background materials on primary market 
and  blockchain.  In  section  3,  we  present  our  2-parts' 
methodology, both quantitative and qualitative. The findings 
of  our  study  are  discussed  in  Section  4.  There  are  some 
potential  research  directions  according  to  our  findings  in 
Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss the threats to the validity 
of our research. Section 7 is the related work. The final section 
gives conclusions and future work. 

Because  of  the  unique  characteristics  of  the  primary 
financial  market,  it  seems  impossible  to  have  a  unified 
exchange system in the world [7]. In practice, the following 
process  shown  in  Fig.  1  is  how  to  conduct  simple  private 
equity transactions in primary market:

the 
introduction  of  a  broker,  sometimes  through  a  friend's 
introduction,  but  most  transactions  are  reached  through  a 
broker,  which  is  usually  called  an  FA  (Financial  Advisor). 
After the buyer and seller contact, if the buyer and seller intend 
to  continue  the  transaction,  they  will  sign  a  non-disclosure 
agreement  (NDA).  After  signing  the  NDA,  the seller  sends 
some of its basic information to the buyer, and the buyer will 
need  to  hire  third-party  service  companies  to  validate  the 
authenticity.  

After the buyer reconfirms that this firm or project is the 
target it is interested in, the buyer will forward to the next step, 
an  on-site  interview.  After  the  interview,  the  DD  (Due 
Diligence) process will be launched, and if both the interview 
and DD  meet  the  buyer's  requirements,  they  will  sign a TS 
(Term  Sheet),  which  can  be  regarded  as  a  promised 
investment agreement. TS is a letter of intent to invest and is 
not subject to legal restrictions. Finally, the buyer and seller 
will sign SPA (Share Purchase Agreement) and other relevant 
agreements to confirm the investment contract, which is the 
final  step  of 
investment  activity.  Other  relevant 
agreements normally include SHA (Shareholders Agreement) 
and PPAA (Predict Profit Allocation Agreement).

II.  BACKGROUND 

B.  Blockchain 

A.  Primary Financial Market 

Since 

the  1970s, 

the  development  of 

information 
technology  has  vigorously  promoted  the  popularization  and 
application  of  the  electronic  and  networked  transaction 
settlement system in the financial market, realizing the rapid 
development  of  the  multi-level  securities  market  and  the 
informatization  of  market  participants.  The  most  prominent 
feature of securities trading is a centralized third-party credit 
or  information  intermediary  agency  as  a  guarantee,  which 
realizes  value  transfer  by  reducing  information  asymmetry 
and  relying  on  traditional  institutions  to  establish  a  trust 
mechanism, no matter in the primary or secondary market. 

Blockchain  technology  is  another  disruptive  technology 
after cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and big data. 
Blockchain can improve the efficiency of digital collaboration 
in  the  actual  business  process  and  provide  a  value-based 
interconnection  infrastructure  for  the  financial  industry  and 
trading methods inside the financial market. According to its 
unique characteristics of "decentralization" and "trust," proper 
application of blockchain technology can ensure that trust is 
established  between  multiple  parties  while  protecting  data 
privacy  and  is  expected  to  become  an  essential  part  of  the 
financial market infrastructure. 

An essential purpose of blockchain technology innovation 
is  to  provide  services  for  financial  transactions.  It  is  a 
distributed ledger for transactions with an append-only feature. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Blockchain was first proposed by Bitcoin [24]. It was initially 
a  decentralized  electronic  instalment  framework,  thereby 
eliminating  any  external  requirements  related  to  instalment 
activities. The first Bitcoin blockchain combined information 
into  a  chain,  coordinated  by  square  hash  values  named 
"blockchain." As stated by [24], Bitcoin is the first form to use 
blockchain as the overall framework of a distributed system. 

III.  METHODOLOGY 

Figure  2  illustrates  the  overview  of  our  methodology 
design,  which combines  the  interview  part and survey  part. 
Interview part: 15 experts from the primary financial market 
are interviewed to get insights into the primary market. Survey 
part: it is used to validate the findings from the interviews. We 
present  how  we  design  and  implement  our  interview  and 
survey in the following. 

Fig. 2.  Methodology design. 

A.  Interview 

In  our  research,  we  adopted  semi-structured  interviews 
[25]. We first exchanged our introductory information, such 
as respective institutions and positions, with the interviewees 
and then introduced our research and purpose. Next, we asked 
some basic qualitative questions to the interviewees. Then, we 
used some open questions to guide the interviewee with our 
directions  (Questions  are  listed  in  Table  1).  These  open 
questions probed the interviewees about their perspectives on 
the primary financial market and applying blockchain in the 
primary  market.  Since 
the  design  of  semi-structured 
interviews, we arranged subsequent questions to delve further 
into our interview participant’s perspectives at a later stage. In 
the end,  we  asked  that  the  interviewee could  give  whatever 
other  significant  data  that  we  may  have  missed  during  the 
interviews. 

1.  What  is  your  role  in  the  primary  market?  Please  describe 

your main duty and goal. 

2.  What are the 3 most common pain points/difficulties in your 

business? 

3.  Let us discuss these pain points one by one: 

1) Regarding pain point 1, please describe in detail, can 

you explain what you think is causing it? 

2) Regarding pain point 2, please describe in detail, can 

you explain what you think is causing it? 

3)  Regarding  pain  point  3,  please  describe  it  in  detail. 

Can you explain what you think is causing it? 

4) Optional: If the respondent does not list any cost, trust 
or  efficiency issues,  we  will  need  the  following  questions. 
What do you think of these issues in the industry? 

4. 

In  view  of  the  above  pain  points,  which  one  do you  think 
needs to be solved urgently? Do you know or understand any 
innovations/solutions to these problems? 

5.  Have you  heard  of  blockchain?  (If  not,  please skip;  if  yes, 
please continue to ask). Do you think that applying it in the 
industry can solve the above problems? 

6. 

If  a  product/technology  can  solve  the  above  problems  in 
some way, will your industry group be willing to use it?  

7.  Do  you  think  you  have  any  relevant  supplements  in  our 
interview today? For example, you think it is important, but 
we forgot to ask. 

Table1. 

Problems  in  primary  financial  market  and  solutions  from 

blockchain 

In  this  interview,  a  total  of  15  interviewees  were 
interviewed. Among them, 5 are at or above the partner level 
of  equity  investment  institutions,  4  are  from  third-party 
service  agencies,  4  are  corporate  financing  directors  or 
directors  of  the  financing  department,  and  2  are  from 
investment  banks  with  solid  experience.  The  interviewees 
covered the prominent participants in the primary market. 

We  have  a  total  of  21  candidates  this  time,  but  due  to 
uncontrollable reasons, such as covid-19 and timing, only 15 
of  them  were  interviewed  by  us  in  the  end.  During  the 
interviews, we followed the procedure utilized in [26] and [27] 
to  choose  when  to stop  the  meeting, i.e.,  halting interviews 
when  there  is enough saturation  of  findings.  Saturation  is a 
methodology that is widely used in qualitative research [28], 
[29], [30]. 

To  ensure  that  our  interviews  are  of  broad-spectrum 
significance, our interviewees covered most types of primary 
market participants, such as investment institutions, financing 
companies, law firms, accounting firms, etc. 

We  made  sure  to  interview  interviewees  from  various 
backgrounds  (as  demonstrated  in  Table  2)  before  deciding 
whether saturation had been reached. In every interview, we 
cooperated to pose questions and take notes. After completing 
each interview, we would contrast their notes with past ones 
to check whether there are any new insights from the interview. 

Because  of  the  Covid-19,  all  interviews  were  conducted 
remotely  via  Zoom  and  WeChat,  and  the  interviewers  took 
notes.  The  average  and  standard  deviation  of  the  interview 
time were 35 and 30 minutes, respectively. Table 2 illustrates 
the basic demographics of the interviewees. According to the

Interviewee’s background.   

1.  Participant Recruitment 

  Two of the authors used to work in the primary financial 
market, and they used their connections to contact an initial 
group  10  candidates.  We  utilized  a  snowball  process  to 
generate another group with another 11 candidates [31], i.e., 
current  participants  refer  the  interview  to  their  target 
participants. There are a total 21 experts agreed to take part in 
the interview. 

2.  Data Analysis 

We used card sorting [6] to recognize the classifications 
from  each  interview.  It  is  a  particular  procedure  to  get 
classifications from data [32], [33]. There are three different 
types: closed card sorting with predefined categories for data, 
open card sorting with no predefined categories, and hybrid 
card  sorting,  which  combines  the  previous  two  types  [34]. 
Considering our research is exploratory with categories (i.e., 
challenges of the primary market) being unknown in advance, 
we chose to conduct an open card sorting process to analyze 
these data. 

In particular, after a card was made for each textual unit in 
the card sorting, the cards were then bunched into influential 
groups with a theme or topic meanings: these groups, i.e., low-
level, mid-level, and high-level categories. The consequences 
of a remarkably open card sorting would allow us to acquire 
various hierarchical designs of categories. Two authors were 
involved in the card sorting process. Every card was identified 
and  analyzed  by  them.  We  identified  three  high-level 

B.  Survey 

1.  Design 

Our questionnaire includes three demographic questions, 
7  primary  financial  market  questions,  and  2  blockchain-
related  questions.  The  demographic  questions  are  single 
choice  and  designed  to  understand  the  background  and 
experience  of  participants.  The  primary  financial  market 
questions are designed to validate insights that we have found 
from  our  interview  part.  The  participants  who  have  been 
interviewed are not asked to respond to the survey. There are 
both  single  choices  and  2  choices  questions  included.  We 
regard  the  2  choices  questions  as  sorting  to  analyze  more 
than  plan  sorting  method.  The 
straightforward  rather 
blockchain-related  questions  are  mainly  designed 
for 
validating our idea that blockchain technology will improve 
the  infrastructure  of  the  primary  financial  market.  The 
complete  list  of  our  survey  questions  can  be  found  in 
Appendix 1. 

2.  Survey Respondent Recruitment and Statistics 

Our potential survey participants are professional experts 
involved in the primary financial market, their primary role 
including investment, financing, brokerage, audit, etc. Since 
the  main  participants  are  from  China  and  some  are  from 
Australia and the United States, we have made Chinese and 
English versions of the questionnaire. This survey is released 
through 
the  application  of  Questionnaire  Star.  The 
respondents  can  use  any  mobile  phone/computer/pad  to 
respond to the survey by scanning the code. 

When  selecting  respondents,  we  pay  more  attention  to 
their  work  experience  in  the  primary  market,  preferably 
compound  working  experience,  to  make  a  more  efficient 
result.  We  do  not  use  other  factors  such  as  academic 
qualifications  to  limit  the selection  of  respondents.  Because 
most of the participants in the primary financial market have 
higher  academic  qualifications,  and  all  the  participants  we 
selected have master or doctoral degrees. To eliminate similar 
ideas from the same company or the same period of work, we 
control that at most two of our respondents are from the same 
company. 

We finally selected 54 respondents. From the perspective 
of the participants' roles, 40.7% of them are from investment 
institutions,  24.07%  from  financing  parties,  20.37%  from 
third-party service intermediaries, and 14.81% from brokers. 
For general working experience, 70.37% of people have more 
than 4 years of work experience, and only 29.63% have less 
than 3 years of work experience. For primary financial market 
working experience, 55.56% of people have more than 4 years 
of  primary  market  experience,  and  only  44.44%  of  people 
have less than 3 years of relevant work experience. Pie charts 
of  broad  working  experience  and  primary  financial  market 
working  experience  are  shown  in  fig.  3.  It  is  a  relatively 
convincing work background structure. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
IV.  FINDINGS 

In  this  part,  firstly,  we  present  our  findings  for  each 
category  (totally  three  categories)  that  were  identified  by 
utilizing  open  card sorting on  the  interview  data. There  are 
subcategories  for  each category, and  we  select  some  of  the 
most effective content and analyze some statistics according 
to  our  survey  feedback  to  highlight  the  generality  of  these 
findings.  Next,  we  introduced  the  voting  results  of  each 
population  group  in  response  to  these  challenges  and  the 
potential  solutions  mentioned  by  the  interviewees  and  the 
related significance tests of these results. Finally, we briefly 
conclude our interview and survey results. 

A.  Complex Due Diligence 

transparency, 

The due diligence process of primary market transactions 
is  mainly  carried  out  through  written  review,  on-site 
inspections,  public  channel  searches, 
interviews,  and 
entrusted third-party investment. As investors continue to pay 
more  attention  to  issues such as  consistency of  interest  and 
information 
their 
the 
preliminary  due  diligence  process  has  also  increased. 
Although  detailed  and  meticulous  due  diligence  meets 
investors' specific due diligence requirements for companies 
to  some  extent,  it  often  takes  too  long,  reduces  transaction 
efficiency, and increases transaction costs. On the other hand, 
due to the lack of a standardized due diligence checklist, some 
investors do not know the extent of their due diligence on the 
company. 

level  of  detail 

in 

B.  Mismatching 

The  primary  market  is  dominated  by  "over-the-counter 
transactions". The two parties may negotiate between the two 
parties  or  through  the  "matching"  of  third-party  service 
agencies to complete the transaction. In this process, there is 
asymmetric  and  redundant  information  in  the  transaction, 
making  it difficult  for both  parties  to  match  the  transaction 
accurately, and the transaction time is lengthened indefinitely. 
At the same time, some trading platforms lack the guarantee 
of credibility, and the ability to label information is weak. It is 
not easy to form a mature trading loop in the primary market. 
This also leads to low matching efficiency between the two 
parties  in  the  primary  market, and  it  is  not  easy  to  achieve 
transactions quickly. 

C.  Difficult Monitoring 

Post-investment monitoring means that investors need to 
understand  the  company's  trends  in  time,  understand  the 
direction  of  capital  use,  identify  problems  in  the company's 
development process, help companies carry out standardized 
management,  and  to  a  certain  extent  restrict  and  deter  the 
company.  It  is  necessary  to  grasp  the  appropriate  degree, 
which can meet your own needs and do not make the invested 
company  feel 
the 
monitoring step. At present, a considerable part of the post-
investment work in the primary market is in a state of groping. 
Post-investment work is relatively casual, lacks standardized 
procedures, and lacks assessment standards. The most direct 

troublesome  and  controlled

market experience in percentage. 

3.  Data Analysis 

After  we  terminated  the  questionnaire  collection,  we 
analyzed  the  closed-ended  questions  by  adopting  different 
analysis methods. We calculated the number of votes for each 
answer option. Next, we counted its percentage rate for each 
answer option by dividing the number of votes for the option 
by 54 (total respondents' number).  

To  better  understand  respondents'  perspectives  of  the 
primary  financial  market's  challenges,  we  divided  the 
participants  into several demographic  groups  and  compared 
their  voting  results  with  each  other's.  Based  on  previous 
studies  [52]  and  [53],  we  constructed 
the  following 
demographic groups: 

• Respondents from the investment field (Inv) 

• Respondents from the financing field (Fin) 

• Respondents from third parties (Thi) 

• Respondents from brokerage (Bro) 

•  Respondents  with  high  general  working  experience 

(>=10 years) (GExpH) 

• Respondents with low general working experience (<=3 

years) (GExpL) 

• Respondents with medium general working experience 

(>3, and <10 years) (GExpM) 

• Respondents with high primary financial market related 

working experience (>=7 years) (FExpH) 

• Respondents with low primary financial market related 

working experience (<=3 years) (FExpL) 

• Respondents with low primary financial market related 

working experience (>3, and <7 years) (FExpM) 

and 

challenges 

financial  market 

We calculated the percentage ratios of their answers to the 
desired 
primary 
improvements  collected  from  the  interview  separately  for 
each  demographic  group.  According  to  [54],  we  applied 
Fisher's exact test [55] with Bonferroni correction [56] to these 
numbers to make sure if one group tended to vote differently 
with  others.  Fisher's  exact  test  reveals  the  frequency 
distribution of the variables (e.g., each option votes from each 
group in our research) in the analysis of contingency tables. It 
can  determine  if  the  observed  difference  between  two 
proportions (i.e., the ratio of votes) is statistically significant. 
The  family-wise  error  could  be  controlled  by  Bonferroni 
correction while making multiple comparisons. Section 4.4.2 
shares the analysis results in detail. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consequence  is  that  post-investment  personnel  do  not  know 
what  to  do  and  cause  laxity.  Investors  seem  to  have  paid 
human  resources  and  financial  resources,  but  the  actual 
monitoring effect is unsatisfactory.

run through all the links of "funding, investment, monitor and 
withdrawal". Funding is to raise funds. People who need to 
maintain  or  increase  their  assets  will  invest  the  money  in 
investment institutions for management. Investment is to find 
a  good  company  or  project  to  invest in equity  or  debt. The 
monitoring  is  to  track  and  manage  invested  projects  and 
conduct  follow-up  reviews.  Withdrawal  is  the  process  of 
finally selling the investment product and cashing out. 

Among  the  15  respondents,  14  respondents  (93.3%) 
believed  that  the  current  due  diligence  procedures  for 
securities issuance are too complicated, time-consuming, and 
costly, and they are on the premise of ensuring the quality of 
issuance. The issuance efficiency will be affected to a certain 
extent under complex due diligence. 10 respondents (66.67%) 
believe  that  it  is  difficult  to  match  the  needs  of  investment 
institutions  with  the  needs  of  invested  companies.  For  the 
investment process of equity investment, 7 (46.67%) believe 
that the drawer agreement is difficult to implement. Regarding 
investment,  11 
the  follow-up  management  of  equity 
respondents (73.3%) believe that the effective implementation 
of post-investment management is facing specific difficulties 
and that there are challenges in fully obtaining various types 
of information on invested companies. At the same time, due 
to  the  imperfect  exit  mechanism,  lack  of  professional 
intermediaries, and insufficient attention to exit management 
in the primary market, it is difficult for the primary market to 
exit equity. 

b)  Causes of the issues in primary market 
All  respondents  agreed  that  the  above-mentioned  pain 
points and difficulties in the current primary market are rooted 
in two aspects: lack of trust (100%) and difficulty in ensuring 
the authenticity of data (100%). 

c)  Issues that need to be solved in primary market 
Faced with the current pain points and difficulties in the 
primary  market,  respondents  believe  that  the  complexity  of 
the  due  diligence  process  (93.3%)  and  post-investment 
management  and  exit  (66.67%)  should  be  resolved  first.  In 
addition,  58.65%  of  the  respondents  believe  that  improving 
the  matching  of  the  needs  of  investment  institutions  and 
invested companies is also an urgent problem that needs to be 
resolved. 

d)  Can the blockchain be used to solve the pain points 

and difficult issues of the primary market? 

the pain points and difficulties of the primary market. 86.67% 
of  the  respondents  have  a  positive  attitude  towards  the 
application of blockchain technology, believing that based on 
the advantages  of  blockchain  technology,  the  application  of 
this  technology  can  solve  some  of  the  pain  points  and 
difficulties. Furthermore, for the specific application scenarios 
of  blockchain  technology  in  the  primary  market,  the  vast 
majority of interviewees did not have a deeper understanding 
and  knowledge,  and  only  one  person  was  familiar  with  the 
application scenarios of blockchain technology and believed 
that  part of  the  trust and  process problems could be solved 
through the characteristics of the blockchain. 

e)  The acceptance of blockchain products in the primary 

market 

100% of the interviewees believe that, on the premise that 
the  transaction  cost  has  not  increased  significantly  if  the 
products based on blockchain technology can better solve the 
pain points and difficulties of the primary market, they will 
choose to use related products.

illustrates the number of respondents in each group. The rows C1 to I27 
represent the percentages (%) of respondents from each group. 

From  Table  4,  we  could  observe  that  the  voting  results 
varied  from  demographic  groups.  For  example,  for  C17, 
FexpH  and  FExpL  were  80%  and75%,  while  the  ratio  was 
only 53.33% for group FExpM. Another example, for I22, the 
ratios  of  GexpH,  GexpL,  and  GExpM  were  50%，18.75%, 
and  26.92%,  respectively.  To  check  whether  the  observed 
ratio  differences  are  statistically  significant,  for  each 
challenge/desired improvement, we applied Fisher’s exact test 
with  Bonferroni  correction  on  three  sets  of  demographic 
groups,  i.e.,  groups  with  different  roles  (Inv  vs.  Fin  vs. Thi 
vs.Bro),  groups  with  different  general  working  experience 
(GExpH vs. GExpL vs. GExpM), and groups with different

From the analysis of the interview and survey, we could 

find the following: 

It is urgent to solve problems with complex due diligence 
processes,  mismatching,

and 
Traditional  solutions  are  challenging  to  eliminate  the  cost 
increase and efficiency loss caused by these problems. In the 
future,  you  can  consider  choosing  emerging  technologies, 
such as  blockchain,  to  solve  these  problems  in  the  primary 
market.  The  current  traditional  solution  is  to  reduce  the 
friction  of  information/trust  issues  by  introducing  financial 
agency, proving lack of efficiency. 

V.  FUTURE DIRECTIONS 

Blockchain  technology  has  the  potential  to  bring  the 
infrastructure  of  the  primary  financial  market  into  the  next 
generation. 

The blockchain has an available feature. Except that the 
private  information  of  each  transaction  party  is  encrypted, 
market  participants  can  query  and  obtain  data  on  the 
the 
blockchain 

interface.  Therefore, 

through  a  public 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information  transparency  of  the  entire  system  is  extremely 
high, and it is more convenient for transaction parties to obtain 
information, which is conducive to reducing the information 
asymmetry  of  both  parties  in  the  market,  improving  the 
matching efficiency of both parties, and faster settlement. 

The use of blockchain technology can reduce the reduction 
in  transaction efficiency and  the  increased  transaction  costs 
caused by the excessively long due diligence process. Using 
the  consensus  of  blockchain  technology,  tamper-proof, 
traceable  features,  and  the  automaticity of  timely  update  of 
node information, all aspects of information involved in the 
transaction  can  be  recorded  on  the  blockchain.  Therefore, 
investors can clearly understand and view the investment and, 
based  on  ensuring  the  credibility  of  assets,  minimize  the 
complicated process involved in the due diligence process. 

The block-based intelligent contract technology can help 
non-standard  off-site  contracts  be  presented  in  executable 
code form, making it easier to realize automated transactions 
of non-standardized contracts. Each market participant in the 
blockchain  has  a  complete  transaction  record,  and  the 
transaction  assets  are  anchored  on  the  blockchain.  The 
conclusion  of  the  contract  becomes  flat  and  automatically 
executed,  which  improves  the  ability  of  both  parties  to 
perform the contract and reduces the transaction counterparty 
risk. 

For  post-transaction events,  like  derivatives  transactions 
and clearing, etc., rely on blockchain technology to manage 
the  DLT  network,  monitor  related  assets,  and  redesign  and 
optimize  related  processes,  improving  market  transparency 
and  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  derivatives  transaction 
management and reduce transaction costs. Benben. 

The peer-to-peer transaction method based on blockchain 
decentralization technology, under the action of the consensus 
mechanism, makes consensus and mutual trust automatically 
reached when both parties of the transaction exchange data, 
which  not  only  ensures  information  security  but  also 
effectively improves efficiency and reduces transaction cost. 

information,  it  can  be  added  voluntarily.  Based  on  [35], 
confidentiality  and  anonymity  might  help  to  obtain  honest 
answers from interviewees. 

In addition, based on the following suggestion [36], that is 
to  provide  services  to  prospective  respondents  in  an 
appropriate  language.  Besides  the  English  version  of  the 
survey,  we  also  translated  the  survey  into  Chinese.  The 
Chinese version of the survey can help Chinese respondents 
more easily understand the questions from our questionnaire. 
Again, we may also draw wrong analysis based on the answers 
of  the  survey.  To  avoid  this  threat,  we  chose  to  read  their 
answers as carefully as possible. 

B.  External Validity 

According  to  our  interview  strategy  [37,  38],  we  only 
interviewed  15  interviewees  because  we  believe  that  the 
saturation  has  reached.  We  admit  that  our  number  of 
interviews is not very large, and the strategy is saturated and 
cannot fully represent all situations, but our interviewees have 
been reset to cover all essential primary market roles. 

Considering that some interviewers will have some ideas 
or opinions that we might miss or have new and meaningful 
ideas after being interviewed by us, all our interviewees are 
experienced.  Their  rich  work  experience  will  increase  the 
completeness of the answers to open questions. 

To validate the results of our interview, we surveyed 54 
participants. Since most of the survey respondents are from 
China, Australia, and the United States, we cannot guarantee 
that our survey results apply to the world. It is anonymous and 
does not require identity verification, so there is no guarantee 
that  the  interviewees  we  are  looking  for  including  all 
participants in the entire primary financial market. To further 
improve  the  generalizability  of  the  research  results,  we 
encourage other scholars to replicate our research with a more 
extensive group of participants in the future. 

VI.  THREATS TO VALIDITY 

VII.  RELATED WORK 

A.  Internal Validity 

In this research, our survey questions are designed based 
on  the  conclusion  of  the  interview.  However,  we  may 
sometimes  misunderstand  or  fail  to  fully  understand  the 
intention of the interviewees. In order to eliminate this threat, 
we slowed down as much as possible during the interview and 
confirmed the content once we did not understand clearly at 
any  time.  The  card  sort  step  is  handled  by  two  authors 
together, so there is the possibility of mistakes, but we have 
tried our best to avoid making mistakes. 

Interviews  and  surveys  also  have  the  possibility  of 
interviewees providing dishonest answers for any reason. To 
reduce  this  bias, we  have  made the  following efforts in  the 
survey: 1) In the letter of invitation, we stated that we would 
not  publish  and  try  our  best  to  avoid  leaking  personal 
information (if provided) and it is entirely confidential; 2) Our 
survey  is  anonymous,  and  it  is  guaranteed  that  we  will  not 
track the participants by answering the questionnaire content. 
If the interviewee wants to provide contact or other personal 

This  section  highlights  related  work  on  applying 
blockchain  technology  into  the  primary  financial  market, 
including  proposed systems  to  help  the  primary  ecosystem, 
core  technologies  of  blockchain,  and  core  advantages  and 
applications of blockchain. 

A.  Proposed Primary Financial Market Systems 

Blockchain  is  continuously  innovated  and  expanded  on 
top of Bitcoin's infrastructure. At present, blockchain can be 
divided into the public chain, alliance chain, and private chain 
according to the access mechanism of nodes and the degree of 
decentralization. Blockchain technology has gone through the 
Bitcoin  era  of  blockchain  1.0  and  the  blockchain  2.0  era 
represented  by  the  alliance  chain.  At  present,  blockchain 
technology  has  transitioned  to  the  blockchain  3.0  era 
represented  by  EOS.  In  terms  of  technical  application, 
according to different actual application scenarios and design 
concepts,  current  blockchain  projects  are  heterogeneous 
blockchains developed using different technical frameworks. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
At present, there are relatively few articles talking about 
the  application  of  blockchain  technology  in  the  primary 
financial  market  in  practice  compared  with  the  secondary 
market.  However,  the  relevant  issues  still  attracted  a  small 
group of scholars' attentions. 

In  terms  of  securities  issuance,  [40]  points  out  that 
replacing the securitization third party in the primary market 
with  a  blockchain-based  system  can  more  accurately  track 
process details, reduce costs, increase issuance speed, increase 
transparency and liquidity. [41] believes that the fraud issues 
of  information  asymmetry  in  the  primary  market  can  be 
reduced  by  adopting blockchain  technology  in  the  financial 
market infrastructure. It proposes a Linked Data-based model, 
which  provides  both  data  verification  and  tamper-proof 
functions to prevent collusion and increase trust in financial 
markets effectively. 

Fig. 4.  Public and private access for accounting information system [42]. 

Authorized  participants  may  get  all  information  on  the 
blockchain immediately, and the information accessed by all 
parties  is  consistent,  which  saves  a  lot  of  due  diligence 
expenses  and  probable  errors  in  the  copying  process, 
according to [42]. It proposed a prototype in Figure 4 for an 
accounting information system with public and private access 
to  record  the  entity's  data  of  access  or  update  for  the 
information.  It  will  improve  the  accuracy  of  financial 
reporting  information  provided  to  shareholders  and  other 
approved persons. [43] demonstrates that due diligence data is 
on-chain,  open,  and  transparent,  significantly  increasing 
information  transparency,  reducing  information  asymmetry, 
and  lowering  fraud  risks.  It  presented  the  ORM  model  in 
Figure 5, which includes a copy of the data before entering the 
database and a blockchain-verified mirror file. The blockchain 
will genuinely update the verified data given to the database 
after relaying it back to the database, preventing the original 
information from being tampered with. 

Fig. 5.  ORM model [43]. 

Scholars  are  also  debating  how  blockchain  technology 
may help save expenses and increase efficiency. [44] claims 
that  using  blockchain  to  promote corporate  governance  and 
legal  frameworks  may  promote  corporate  transparency  and 
efficiency when the record is established, and that blockchain 
technology has enhanced automation. [45] shown that when 
pre-set  criteria  are  satisfied,  equity  transactions  may  be 
automatically completed by putting smart contract terms into 
an  automated  programming  language.  More  specifically,  it 
employs machine learning to assess the desire and ability of 
borrowers,  and  it  leverages  a  blockchain-based  system  to 
predict the borrower's future willingness instantaneously. 

Fig. 6.  Interlinked Blockchain Ecosystems [49]. 

Furthermore,  several  publications  are  based  on  a 
governance standpoint, believing that apps aid departmental 
monitoring.  [46]  outlines  why  blockchain  technology  can 
replace  finance  agencies  and  discusses  the  history  of 
employing blockchain in the primary market at an early level. 
[47] describes how the supervision department identifies the 
nodes on the chain and acquires the public key to monitor the 
fundamental data in real-time. At the same time, owing to the 
blockchain's  infallibility,  the  information's  validity  and 
traceability  are  ensured.  [48]  show  that  auditing  and 
supervision might no longer be limited to sampling but will 
collect and process all data via a blockchain network that is 
maintained and shared. In contrast to the previous architecture 
(Fig. 6), the auditor can evaluate the data inside before going 
outside  [49]. After  the  report  is  completed,  the auditor will 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
place  it  in  the  external  ecosystem  to  prevent  external 
institutions and customers from altering the data regularly. It 
eliminates data transmission manipulation and leakage while 
increasing data authenticity. 

[50] proposed a paradigm for considering modifications to 
an existing Blockchain, which is depicted in Figure 7. When 
someone  changes  to  financial  or  commercial  data,  the 
information is sent to all blockchain participants. The operator 
will  have  a  tough  time  removing  the signs  of  their  change. 
Data exchange assists the system inefficiently in preventing 
property fraud. 

Fig. 7.  Considerations for Changes to an Existing Blockchain [50]. 

Although  the  deployment  of  blockchain  in  the  primary 
market is technically viable, the present progress in practice is 
modest. It is mainly owing to regulatory constraints, and no 
consistent  norm  exists  [51].  Some  current  regulatory 
prohibitions  will  be  lifted  because  of  the  government's 
acknowledgment of blockchain and the technological progress 
of distributed systems in the future. 

VIII.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

Based  on  our  research  of  combining  qualitative  and 
quantitative methods, we concluded that the most concerning 
issues  in  the  primary  financial  market  are  complex  due 
diligence,  mismatch,  and  difficult  monitoring.  When  the 
current  challenges  are  combined  with  the  advantages  of 
blockchain  technology,  we  find  that  blockchain  may  be  a 
suitable  technology  that  can  solve  the  above  challenges  in 
primary financial markets. In the future, we will focus on our 
findings,  along  with  blockchain  and  other  technologies,  to 
build  a  better  infrastructure  for  primary  financial  market 
participants. 

resorting 

Incentives,  governance,  and  consensus  created  by 
mathematical  laws,  making  it  possible  to  realize  asset 
transactions  without 
financial 
intermediaries.  This  is  having  an  impact  on  the  underlying 
financial  infrastructure.  With  the  support  of  blockchain 
technology, securities investors and issuers can realize direct 
securities  transactions  and  realize  cross-time  allocation 
without financial intermediary credit endorsement.
