Abstract

It has been proposed in the literature that the volume of Einstein–Rosen bridge

is equal to complexity of state preparation (”Complexity=Volume” conjecture). Tak-

ing this statement outside the horizon, one might be tempted to propose ”Complex-

ity=Time” correspondence.

In this Essay1 we argue that in a blockchain protocol,

which is the foundation of all modern cryptocurrencies, time is emergent and it is

deﬁned according to a version of ”Complexity=Time”.

Introduction

Black hole interior is a mysterious place. Celebrated Einstein–Rosen(ER) bridge solution

has two universes connected via a two-sided black hole interior - Figure 1 (Left). The volume

of this interior, evaluated on certain Cauchy slices, grows linearly with time. It is expected

that this growth can continue until the volume becomes of order eS0, where S0 is the black

hole entropy deﬁned as the quarter of its horizon area.

Figure 1: Left: ER bridge and its growth. Right: quantum circuit.

If we believe that S0 characterizes the number of black hole degrees of freedom, the volume

can become exponentially big in this number. However, all usual thermodynamic quantities

scale linearly with the number of degrees of freedom, not exponentially. It prompted the

authors of [1, 2, 3] to argue that the volume of the ER bridge is equal to the (quantum)

complexity of state preparation:

Complexity=Volume.

(1)

This complexity is deﬁned as a minimum number of “basis” quantum gates required to

prepare a state starting from some ﬁxed simple one - Figure 1 (Right). This quantity can

be as big as enumber of qubits, but cannot be bigger. Recently it was explicitly demonstrated

[4] in a model of 2d gravity that ER-bridge length indeed saturates at eS0. We refer to [5, 6,

7, 8] regarding the recent challenges to this conjecture.

“Complexity=Volume” operates with the volume inside a black hole interior. Colloqui-

ally, when go outside a black hole interior we trade a space coordinate to a time coordinate.

Hence more generally, without any black holes, we can expect that

Complexity=Time.

(2)

It would be very interesting to ﬁnd explicit physical examples of such correspondence. The

trivial time evolution in energy eigenstates manifests in non-trivial conditional expectation

values of local operators 2.

It has been proposed before that spacetime could arise from

entanglement [10, 11, 12, 13]. However, standard quantum entanglement is a feature 3 of a

given state(i.e. Cauchy slice). We propose that time dynamics comes from complexity.

In absence of “conventional” physical examples, in the rest of this Essay we would like to

argue that “Complexity=Time” is the underlying principle of a blockchain protocol, which is

the foundation of all modern cryptocurrencies. We will see a few familiar physical phenomena

in blockchains:

• Lorenzian time-like geodesics maximize the proper distance. Correspondingly, the

“current time” in blockchains is deﬁned by ﬁnding the maximal complexity slice.

• Non-traversability of ER-bride can be attributed to its length growth: the length grows

too fast for an observer to cross the horizon.

In blockchain, a single observer(with

limited computational resources) cannot “change history”(i.e. time travel) exactly for

the same reason: the blockchain grows too fast.

• As a bonus point, blockchain has a version of error correction: communication errors

between individual observers do not cause the system to break down as a whole.

• It was proposed by Hayden and Preskill [18], that once a black hole has radiated away

half of its entropy, an observer who has access to the radiation can actually retrieve

information from the interior. In blockchain 4 , an observer who has (50 + (cid:15))% of the

total computational power can in fact change the entire history of blockchain. We

can interpret this as an ability to actually cross the horizon to get information about

the interior despite interior growing very fast. However, rewriting blockchain history

2To put it diﬀerently, an expectation value of an operator can serve as a clock.
3There are certain notions of ”entanglement in time”[14, 15, 16]. It has been proposed to use it in order

to create a quantum analogue of blockchain [17]. In this Essay we concentrate on classical blockchain.

4I am grateful to Ying Zhao for reminding me about Hayden–Preskill protocol.

will still require a lot of computational time. This agrees with results of Harlow and

Hayden [19].

Although a reader should keep in mind that the discussion in the next Section is purely

classical. Whenever we refer to ”complexity” in blockchain it is (appropriately deﬁned)

classical complexity of performing arithmetic operations.

2 Essentials of blockchain

In this Section we describe the essential properties of blockchain using physics language. The

presentation here includes only the most basic features. For example, we will omit public

key signatures.

In physics terms, blockchain solves the problem of emergent (decentralized) time:

• Suppose we have N observers who constantly produce and send each other classical

messages about events happened to them. How can they agree on a global time? By

”time” here we mean arranging the messages they sent/received in a linear order.

Moreover, most of the observers should end up with the same sequence of messages. Syn-

chronizing clocks and then time–stamping messages is not a good solution: clocks can easily

be desynchronized (either randomly or at will) and observers would not be able to resolve

disputes. If Alice and Bob have messages in diﬀerent orders they would not be able decide

between themselves who is right. Moreover, one observer may send diﬀerent versions of the

same message to diﬀerent people. This way diﬀerent observers may record diﬀerent history

and there is no consensus between them. In computer science language one may call this

“attack” or “malignant intent”, but in physics language we can attribute this to a statistical

ﬂuctuation.

Let us illustrate this point. Suppose we have three observes: Alice, Bob and Carol. Carol

wants to divide the inheritance between Alice and Bob. A problem might arise if she sends

4

“Alice gets everything” to Bob and “Bob gets everything” to Alice:

How do Alice and Bob decide which version is right?

Another problem may arise if Carol initially declares that Alice should inherit everything,

but then changes her mind and sends a message to everyone that Bob gets everything:

(3)

(4)

This is equivalent to travelling back in time to change the will.

Blockchain [20] solves both of these problems under a number of reasonable assumptions.

We have to assume that observers have comparable computational resources and that there

is a bound on how long it takes to send a message between the observers (we refer to [21]

for a discussion on this point). It can be arbitrary big, but it has to be bounded.

One may wonder what does it mean to have “comparable computational resources” and

“how long it takes to send a message” if we do not have a global time. Is it not the point of

this paper to use the computational complexity to deﬁne “time”? The most important thing

here is that we have multiple observers. For a single observer who, by whatever reason, is

capable of producing messages by doing mathematical operations there is no problem at the

ﬁrst place: the sequence of their messages can deﬁne time for them. The problem arises when

we have multiple observers. If we bring them together they can compare the rates at which

they can do computations. They can do it in terms of “how many ”standard“ computations

a similar way. As a bonus point, we will allow these two quantities to have ﬁnitely-bounded

ﬂuctuations. From General Relativity we know that we cannot synchronize clocks in this

case to deﬁne a truly global time. This is why this whole construction will be probabilistic.

First of all, blockchain forces a one-dimension structure on the sequence of messages. We

want to arrange messages in a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain:

Block N-2

Block N-1

(5)

We need appropriate functions to create new blocks (local step) and we need to somehow

compare diﬀerent chains (global step). The ﬁrst involves the so-called proof-of-work [22].

We introduce two functions: Create, which creates a valid new block given the previous one

and some message we want to store:

Block N = Create(Block N-1, new message),

and Verify, which veriﬁes the validity of block N given the previous block:

Verify(block N|block N-1) = True or False.

(6)

(7)

The important distinction between these two functions is the computational complexity:

creating(mining) a new block must be very computationally expensive, whereas verifying

the validity of a block must be very easy 5.

5The way it is achieved in Bitcoin is the following. A single block has the following structure:

new block:

Scramble(the whole of previous block)
new message
nonce

(8)

Each message is, of course, the amount of money one user sent to another. In this sense any cryptocurrency
is just a public ledger. Function Scramble is a highly-scrambling function. It is easy to apply it, but very
hard to invert. It would be convenient to assume that it produces a number. In computer science they are

6

Now we know how to create chains of blocks. How do we compare diﬀerent chains?

Satoshi Nakamoto in their paper on Bitcoin proposed the following criteria [20]:

T he longest (valid) chain is the correct one.

(9)

Here the word “longest” can be substituted by “the most complex”, as each block has

approximately the same complexity. So if an observer wants to append a block, they should

ﬁnd the longest (valid) chain and append their block there. This way blockchain constantly

grows.

One important exception is when we have two chains of equal length (a fork). Let us

return to the example of Carol sending diﬀerent messages to Alice and Bob. Now that the

sequence of messages is one dimensional, she will have to create a fork where in one branch

Alice gets everything and Bob gets everything in the other:

(10)

In this case a third-party observer who sees these two chains can pick up any branch they

want to continue attaching messages. Other users will do that too and after a few more

blocks the tie will be broken and one of the branches will dominate. This is illustrated by

often referred to as one-way functions. For example, Bitcoin uses SHA256 as a one-way function. It can
map anything to a 256-bit number. Examples of its outputs(using 16-base numbers) are:
SHA256(”Hello World”)=64ec88ca00b268e5ba1a35678a1b5316d212f4f366b2477232534a8aeca37f3c
SHA256(”Hello, World”)=4ae7c3b6ac0beﬀ671efa8cf57386151c06e58ca53a78d83f36107316cec125f
“Nonce” is just an extra “junk” number which must be added to satisfy the following validity criteria(we
are still simplifying a few things):

Number Scramble(whole new block) starts with 8 zeros.

In general, there are no good ways to produce the correct nonce except bruteforce trial and error. An attempt
to change a message inside the block number N − 1 will lead to a diﬀerent Scramble(block N-1) and hence
one will have to ﬁnd a new nonce for the block number N .

7

Alice gets everythingBob gets everythingthe following ﬁgure:

(11)

It is in this sense that blockchain has error correction: possible error on Carol’s side does

not lead to loss of consensus among other observers.

However, one must be aware that it introduces a probabilistic aspect in a history de-

ﬁned by blockchain: a newly created block(blue) might not stay in the (dominant branch

of) blockchain, as it might not reach other observers before they extend the blockchain

diﬀerently(green), rendering the original block to be an outcast:

So the resulting structure resembles a tree rather than a chain: there are many blocks(red)

(12)

8

Alice gets everythingBob gets everythingit seems that the blue block is successfully added:However newly addedgreen blocks make it an outcast:which do not belong to the maximal complexity slice:

(13)

The maximal complexity slice determines which events actually happend and in what order

they happened. Given a block, the more blocks there are after it the more likely it will stay

on the maximal slice6. The block number along the maximal complexity slice is what one

might call “emergent time”. This is similar to time-like geodesics in Lorenzian signature, as

they too are supposed to have maximal length.

Let us see show blockchain prohibits time travel. Suppose Carol wants to go back in

time to change her will. She will have to change the corresponding block in the far past

(in blockchain time), as at present Alice owns everything. She cannot just modify a single

block in the past, as it will render the subsequent blocks invalid: remember that Verify

function depends on a block and its parent. “Time-traveller” will have to create a new

branch and redo the whole sequence of blocks after the modiﬁed one. The newly created

branch will be rejected by other observers, as it has low complexity. With time the disparity

will only grow, assuming that more than a half of observers work on the main branch. It

is very computationally expensive to produce new blocks and the main branch will grow

much faster. This is illustrated by the following ﬁgure (red blocks represent the alternative

6In Bitcoin, after adding a new block it is standard to wait for an extra 3-4 new blocks to make sure your

block will stick.

history):

(14)

This is reminiscent of ER-bridge: it is non-traversable because its length grows too fast for

an observer to cross it. Of course, if more than a half of the users decide on a diﬀerent

history, it can become the actual history, as (50 + (cid:15))% of the observers(or a single observer

who has (50 + (cid:15))% of all the computational power) are in principle capable of producing a

brand new branch and make it long. However, it will not be easy for them as they will have

to remake all old blocks and then catch up with the main branch, which is constantly being

extended by the rest (50 − (cid:15))%.

3 Discussion

In the previous Section we reviewed the proof-of-work-based blockchain protocol and argued

that it has many similarities to the recent proposals about complexity in quantum gravity.

We proposed “Complexity=Time” relation and used (classical) blockchain to illustrate how

it already works in practice.

It would be interesting to make these observations more quantitative. For example, in

blockchain a single observer who has more than 50% of the total computational power can

actually “time travel”. An analogue to this would be the possibility of (potentially one-sided)

10

Block NBlock 2++Block 1Block 2'Block N++Block 1Block 2'Block 3'BlockN+100500(after a few new blocks...)observer crossing the ER bridge provided that they have enough computational power. It

would be interesting to also relate this to Hayden–Preskill protocol.

One important distinction between modern cryptocurrency protocols and gravity com-

plexity proposals is that the former one is purely classical whereas the later is quantum.

Quantum complexity, unlike the classical one, is bounded and exhibits Poincare recurrency.

It would be interesting to see if there is a room for a switchback eﬀect [23] in classical

blockchain. A more drastic distinction concerns observability: blockchain exploits the fact

that complexity can be easily observed: just count the number of blocks. Whereas it has

been argued [24] that quantum complexity is very hard to determine and relating it to a

rather simple observable in the bulk(volume) have serious consequences for computer science

and AdS/CFT dictionary in general.

Obviously it would be extremely interesting to quantize blockchain. There is exten-

sive literature on ”quantum blockchain”, but most of it discusses how to make classical

blockchain resilient to quantum attacks. We refer to [17] for a description of a ”truly

quantum” blockchain.

In the context of black holes, it has been proposed that a series

of shockwaves can be used to store information in a secure way [24].

Finally, it is worth noting that there are many other alternatives to proof-of-work, such

as proof-of-space[25] and proof-of-stake [26, 27]. All of them try to exploit the same idea:

there is a distributed commodity(such as computational power or hard–drive space) which is

used to secure the blockchain. As long as no one has more than a half of the commodity, the

protocol is secure. The main disadvantage of proof-of-work is that all observers compete 7

with each other to produce(mine) blocks. This results in a huge energy consumption. Other

protocols try to alleviate this by sometimes allowing certain users to create blocks “for

free”(in terms of resources required). The main problem with this is the so-called “nothing-

at-stake” attack: the selected observers will then try to add blocks to diﬀerent branches as

much as possible, making sure they will get a reward. One has to add extra rules to penalize

7In the actual cryptocurrency protocols this is encouraged by giving money for each created block.
