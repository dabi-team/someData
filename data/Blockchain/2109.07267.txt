JUBILEE: Secure Debt Relief and Forgiveness

David Cerezo Sánchez
david@calctopia.com

Yom Kippur
10th of Tishrei, 5782
Shmitah and Yovel ∗

Abstract

JUBILEE is a securely computed mechanism for debt relief and for-
giveness in a frictionless manner without involving trusted third parties,
leading to more harmonious debt settlements by incentivising the parties
to truthfully reveal their private information. JUBILEE improves over all
previous methods:

- individually rational, incentive-compatible, truthful/strategy-proof,
ex-post eﬃcient, optimal mechanism for debt relief and forgiveness with
private information

- by the novel introduction of secure computation techniques to debt
relief, the “blessing of the debtor ” is hereby granted for the ﬁrst time: debt
settlements with higher expected proﬁts and a higher probability of success
than without using secure computation

A simple and practical implementation is included for “The Secure

Spreadsheet”.

Another implementation is realised using Raziel smart contracts on a

blockchain with Pravuil consensus.

Keywords: secure computation, mechanism design, debt forgiveness

Introduction

As it is written in the Torah, the Jubilee is the remission year at the end of
seven cycles of seven years when slaves and prisoners are freed, properties are
returned to their original owners and debts are forgiven 1 to prevent proﬁting

∗According to Chatam Sofer’s way of calculating the Yovel, 118*49=5782 (caveat: others

may dispute the exact year, e.g., 5782+1).

from the poor 2. The ﬁrst Jubilee was celebrated in AM 2553, starting the
count 14 years after entering Eretz Yisrael 3, as it was previously commandeth
4: Jubilees were announced with a shofar 5, an instrument made from a ram’s
horn (i.e., a yobhel or yoveil, from which the term Jubilee is derived 6) and they
provided a regulated and periodical “clean state” for debt forgiveness.

By setting debt forgiveness on a ﬁxed and periodical calendar, the Jubilee
resolved the age-old social problem of debt relief: modernly, governments enforce
an intricate system of debt collectors, courts and legal procedures. In these cases,
third parties are involved to handle conﬂicts of interests between distrusting
parties:

• debtors request too much debt forgiveness

• creditors grant debt settlements as small as possible, trying to take as
many assets as possible from debtors: in some instances, the true amount
of debt relief needed is less than the expected revenue from the debtor
to fulﬁl their debt obligations, but the stated debt recovery values from
creditors exceed said expected revenue and/or continuation value of the
debtor, making it ﬁnancially impossible for the debtor to compensate the
creditors. As a result, future projects from debtors will not be undertaken,
even if socially desirable, sacriﬁced to satisfy the overstated demands from
creditors.

For the ﬁrst time, by combining mechanism design and secure computation we
manage to reconcile the demands of debtors and creditors in to create a new debt
relief mechanism in which the best course of action is the truthful revelation of
their private information: removing most of the conﬂict from the situation, third
parties are no longer needed and frictionless debt settlements can be reached.

1.1 Contributions

In summary, we make the following contributions:

• an individually rational, incentive-compatible, truthful/strategy-proof, ex-
post eﬃcient, optimal mechanism for debt relief and forgiveness with
private information is introduced

• further, an implementation using secure computation is presented

In a nutshell, we contribute a new methodology for debt relief and forgiveness in a
frictionless and strifeless way without resorting to third parties (i.e., courts, debt
collectors), revamping an age-old problem with modern cryptographic techniques
such that truthful revelation of private information is the best strategy for all
parties involved.

In section 2, we discuss related literature and prior work. In section 3, we
ﬁrst introduce our model, then proceed to describe a direct mechanism for
debt settlements, and ﬁnally describe the optimal mechanism. In section 4, we
describe our implementations of the optimal mechanism and then we conclude
in section 5.

2 Related Literature

The literature on the combination of secure computation and mechanism design is
surprisingly scarce: it mostly focuses on the problems of secure computation with
rational actors [ADGH06, IML05, HT04, GK06, OPRV08], and the combination
of secure computation with the incentive-compatible Vickrey auction or its
generalisation as the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism [EL03, NPS99, BS05].
Truthfulness is absolutely necessary for secure computation to gain acceptance
in the real world: although any truthful mechanism can be securely computed
[Xia11], the converse does not hold. Thus, further research is needed to devise
securely computed mechanisms that encourage participants to report their
information truthfully.

2.1 Prior Work in Cryptography

Previous literature considered the use of secure computation technologies for
credit origination and rating [BP20, DDN+15, AKL12, HFT21, FAZ05], but not
for debt relief.

This paper also shows that the moral character of cryptographic work [Rog15]
goes way beyond preventing “mass surveillance”, as it’s currently customary in
the ﬁeld of cryptography.

2.2 Prior Work in Game Theory

Some seminal papers [O’N81, AM85] started the game-theoretic study of bankruptcy
problems in the Talmud: see [HV01, Tho13] for surveys of the extensive literature
that followed, including alternative derivations of the Mishnah of the Talmud
rule 7 using cooperative bargaining [DV93] and the strategic Nash cooperative
solution [MTY20]. Note that the Talmud rule is so inﬂuential that it was adopted
as law (halakha) in other contexts 8 and it became a source of great discussion9
as Talmud scholars were trying to unravel and interpret it.

Ha’Ohel, vol. 1 page 2b

!ה"!ב

This paper fundamentally departs from this line of work found in the game-

theoretic literature:

1. it focuses on debt relief via debt settlements, it’s not restricted to equitable

partitions between creditors

2. creditors are allowed to have private information (i.e., all information is

not public)

3. it uses cryptography as a primary tool to achieve its goals

4. it performs better than the Talmud rule in neutralising creditor’s conﬂict

of interests

The ultimate reason for this innovation is “mi-p’nei tikkun ha-olam” (i.e., for the
bettering of the world, and for repairing the world, as modernly interpreted): as
participation is individually rational for creditors (see next condition 3.3), it is
economically rational to participate even with the institution of the prozbul 10,
a legal subterfuge to circumvent the commandeth forgiveness of loans even after
the Shmitah and the Yovel.

3 Model and Design

This paper is primarily concerned with a setting of distrusting parties, a debtor
entity and multiple creditors, holding asymmetric information used as input in a
process to settle non-marketable debt (i.e., creditors are assumed not to trade
between themselves). The debtor entity is an intentional generalisation in order
to abstract away the more speciﬁc cases of a private party, a corporation or an
indebted sovereign state: note that each of these speciﬁc cases may need further
reﬁnements to this general model. The results of this section are themselves
based on these works: [Mye81].

3.1 Model Setup

A highly indebted entity with total outstanding debt D and no cash in hand
needs funds from external sources for an investment of I (i.e., for debt service
and to ﬁnance another project) that will generate future cash ﬂows given by
the Discounted Cash Flow of the current Asset continuation value plus the
Investment value, A + I: if the entity ﬁles for bankruptcy, the opportunity of
the investment in the other project will be lost. It is assumed that the entity is
prohibited by existing covenants from issuing new higher priority debt senior
to the existing outstanding debt: in other words, the entity can only undertake
the investment if it settles the outstanding debt after successful negotiations
with n risk-neutral creditors to fully or partially write down the principal of the
debt since creditors would be the main beneﬁciaries of the investment I, thus
avoiding bankruptcy and ensuring the continuation of the debtor entity.

10Gittin 4:3; Mishnah Sheviit 10

!ה"!ב

To ease exposition, we assume that the risk-free interest rate is zero and that
each creditor has an identical share of the total outstanding debt, d = (D/n),
each with equal priority. The willingness to cancel some of the debt depends on
two factors:

1. The estimated percentage of debt cancellation from other creditors.

2. The expected recovery value θi for each creditor i in case of bankruptcy if
the entity does not receive any investments and/or debt cancellation, and
we assume that θi represents the expected recovery value if the creditor
owned claims to his proportional part n of the total entire value of the
entity.

The creditor type θi is private information and everyone holds identical expecta-
tions about the possible value of θi, captured by the random variable

Θi : (cid:2)θ, θ(cid:3) → [0, 1]

with distribution F (θi), density φ (θi), and θ ≤ D. With each creditor acting as
Bayesian decision-maker [Har67], creditor types are identically and independently
distributed, its list denoted by the vector θ = (θ1, . . . , θn) and the set of all
possible types of s = 1, 2, . . . , n creditors arise from their diﬀerent preferences,
given by

Is = (cid:8)θ | θ ≤ θj ≤ θ for j = 1, 2, . . . , s(cid:9)
Remark 1. We assume that each creditor θi are the only private knowledge, that
is, the vector θ = (θ1, . . . , θn) .

We further assume that F (θi), D, A, and I are common knowledge. There
would be no uncertainty about how much debt forgiveness should be granted if
the vector θ was publicly known.

Additionally, we deﬁne

φ (θ) =

n
(cid:89)

j=1

φ (θj)

θ−i = (θ1, . . . , θi−1, θi+1, . . . , θn)

φ (θ−i) =

φ (θj)

(cid:89)

j(cid:54)=i

Creditor i may also know the expected recovery by other creditors (i.e., us-
ing secure computation), in that case, the revised expected recovery value in
bankruptcy would be given by the following liquidation value

li (θi, θi−1) = θi +

(cid:88)

j(cid:54)=i

ei (θj)

with non-decreasing revised estimation function ei : (cid:2)θ, θ(cid:3) → R deﬁning how the
creditor would revise his estimate if he knew the estimate of creditor j , and

satisfying

(cid:90) θ

θ

ei (θj) φ (θj) dθj = 0, such that ∀j (cid:54)= i,

(3.1)

implying that θi would still be the expected recovery value of θi because

(cid:90)

In−1

li (θi, θ−i) φ (θ−i) dθ−i = θi.

As it is evident, the expected recovery value of θi cannot exceed the full value of
the debt,

li (θi, θ−i) ≤ d such that ∀θi ∈ (cid:2)θ, θ(cid:3) , θ−i ∈ In−1.

In this paper we use the following deﬁnition of eﬃciency:

Deﬁnition 2. (Ex-post eﬃciency). We consider a debt relief process by debt
settlement to be ex-post eﬃcient if and only if the entity remains solvent after
the new investment is undertaken with probability one when

A ≥

n
(cid:88)

i=1

li (θi, θ−i) ,

and if the investment is undertaken with probability zero, the entity goes
bankrupt. Debt settlement can only be eﬃcient if there is a surplus in the
diﬀerence between the value of an entity in solvency and the value of the entity
in bankruptcy,

Finally, note that the problem of debt settlement is a problem of asymmetric
information: if the debtor entity knew the true value of θi for every creditor, it
would be individually rational to propose a settlement arrangement giving each
creditor i his expected recovery value if and only if the settlement arrangement
is ex-post eﬃcient (i.e., continuation would be Pareto-eﬃcient) and all creditors
would accept. Thus, asymmetric information is a key feature of debt settlements
and θi is assumed to be private information: hence the use of secure computation,
to enable the privacy-preserving computation of said private information between
the distrusting parties.

3.2 A Direct Mechanism for Debt Settlement

In this sub-section, we obtain an ex-post eﬃcient revelation mechanism to settle
the outstanding debt, by making use of the Revelation Principle:

Deﬁnition 3. (Revelation Principle [Mye81]). Every equilibrium outcome of
any arbitrary mechanism can be implemented as an outcome in a truth-telling
equilibrium of an incentive-compatible direct revelation mechanism.

For each creditor, it’s the best response to report his true type in a truth-
telling Bayesian equilibrium point of the revelation game, thus creditors and the
debtor entity would follow the instructions of the following protocol:

Functionality FY OV EL

1. Each creditor privately reports their private information θi to a trusted
party, at the same time.
2. Using the private reports, a trusted party calculates and instructs:

• the debtor entity to invest with probability k, or go bankrupt with
probability 1 − k. In case of continuing solvent, the entity must make
payments to the creditors as deﬁned by the vector

t = (t1, . . . , tn)

• each creditor i must forgive an amount of debt equal to d − ti if the

debtor is not declared bankrupt.

The vector of reported types is deﬁned by

the ideal model or a Secure Multi-Party Computation program in the real model,
then tj
is the investment
probability when creditor i reports ˆθi and all the creditors announce their true
types. Note that for the mechanism to be truthful equilibrium, it must be
individually rational for all players to participate and an equilibrium for each
creditor to report their true θi.

fully outside of bankruptcy, deﬁning the individually rational (IR) participation
constraint: in other words, no party is forced to participate in the mechanism,
and each creditor is granted veto power over the debt settlement via their joint
control of the probability k () thus eﬀectively imposing negative externalities on
each other (note that extensions to this model introducing majority voting rules
are also possible).

On the other hand, the expected utility of the debtor entity from the mecha-

nism Γ = (t, k) in a truth-telling equilibrium is

(3.5)

An additional incentive-compatibility constraint (IC) for the mechanism
Γ = (t, k) must be satisﬁed for truthful reporting to be an equilibrium, which
in conjunction with the individually rational (IR) participation constraint 3.3
deﬁne the mechanism as a feasible mechanism:

(IC) U

(cid:16)

θi, ˆθi, ti, k

(cid:17)

≥ U (θi, θj, ti, k) , such that ∀θi, θj ∈ (cid:2)θ, θ(cid:3) , ∀i, j.

(3.6)

To obtain incentive-compatibility [Mye81], it’s a ﬁrst necessary and suﬃcient

condition that

K (θi) =

(cid:90)

In−1

k (θi, θi−1) φ (θ−i) dθ−i

must be decreasing in θi for all θi ∈ (cid:2)θ, θ(cid:3).
In other words, the higher the
expected recovery value of a creditor the smaller the probability that the entity
will remain solvent as expected by that same creditor. The other second necessary
and suﬃcient condition derived from [Mye81] is that ∀θi,

U (θi, θi, ti, k) = U (cid:0)¯θ, ¯θ, ti, k(cid:1) +

!ה"!ב

granting, for the highest type θ, the expected change in utility to each creditor i
plus a positive mark-up: the new rightmost term of the right-hand side is an
economic incentive given to creditors of type θi < ¯θ by the mechanism to induce
them to reveal that they are the creditors more inclined to grant debt forgiveness
(i.e., an “informational rent”). To derive the equation 3.7, we start denoting by
ˆU (θi,θi,, k, t) as the maximum utility of creditor i from the mechanism (k, t):
then, by the envelope theorem[Sam47, Mil04, MS02],

d ˆU
dθi

(cid:90)

= −

In−1

k (θi, θ−i) φ (θ−i) dθ−i ≤ 0

Therefore, by reintegration we obtain the previous equation 3.7

Now let’s look at the incentive-compatible mechanism most favourable to the

Proof. Note that by the debtor’s participation constraint 3.5 (EXABB),

V (θ, k, t) ≥ 0

and that 3.10 is derived from the debtor’s expected utility 3.4, then it trivially
follows that 3.11 must also be positive.

Deﬁnition 5. (Blessing of the debtor ). The willingness of creditors to grant debt
forgiveness is higher when using secure computation for their private information.
This paradoxical situation is the opposite of the “winner’s curse” from auction
theory [BBM19]: given that an agreement on debt forgiveness among creditors
must be unanimous 3.3 , then debt forgiveness could only happen if all creditors
are willing to grant forgiveness because their expected recovery value from
bankruptcy is low, thus the willingness of each creditor gets reinforced from the
private information obtained from other creditors.

Theorem 6. The expected proﬁts of the debtor are higher when there are dif-
ferences in private information, and not just diﬀerences in preferences, for any
incentive-compatible k (θ).

Proof. A creditor is more willing to grant debt forgiveness when there are
diﬀerences in private information (i.e., the blessing of the debtor 5) because the
expected recovery value conditional on a successful settlement is smaller than the
unconditional expected recovery value, given that all creditors consider that debt

10

!ה"!ב

settlements will only prosper when other debtholders expect a low recovery value.
This allows the debtor entity to extract more debt forgiveness from creditors
under private information.

Debtor’s expected proﬁts are given by 3.8 if the investment rule k (θ) is
incentive-compatible. When there are only diﬀerences in preferences, the revision
functions are ei (θj) = 0 for all values of i, j, and θj, thus we only need to show
that

Since ei (θi) is increasing and by deﬁnition (cid:82) θ

A recent impossibility result [JM00] further limits mechanisms’ ability to
implement eﬃcient allocations when creditors’ private values aren’t private
information (i.e., with secure computation as used here).

Theorem 7. (Jehiel-Moldovanu Impossibility Theorem [JM00, Mil04]). Let Γ(θ)
be a mechanism where the liquidation value li (θi, θi−1) depends on the valuations
of other creditors but without private information, and suppose that the function
E (cid:0)θi(cid:1) ≡ E (cid:2)Γi (θ) |θi(cid:3) depends non-trivially on θi
−i. Then, no mechanism exists
that implements Γ at any Bayes-Nash equilibrium.

Corollary 8. The use of secure computation techniques enables debt settlements
with higher expected proﬁts, thus attaining the “blessing of the debtor” 5 with
eﬃcient allocations for creditors.

Proof. Follows from previous Theorem 6, since secure computation enables com-
putation on private information between multiple distrusting parties. Addition-
ally, eﬃcient allocations for creditors are only possible with private information
by Theorem 7.

Additionally Theorem 6 implies that condition 3.11 of Theorem 4 will be
satisﬁed with higher probability when there are diﬀerences in private information,
making debt settlements more eﬃcient.

3.3 An Optimal Revelation Mechanism

We start choosing the investment rule k (θ) to maximise the debtor’s expected
utility given by 3.10,

ˆk (θ) =

(cid:40)

1 if A ≥ (cid:80)n
0 otherwise

i=1

(cid:104)

li (θi, θ−i) + F (θi)
φ(θi)

(cid:105)

In other words, the entity will remain solvent if the continuation value is higher
than the sum of the expected recovery values in bankruptcy, plus the terms
(F (xi) /φ (θi)): this investment rule ˆk (θ) and the condition that U (cid:0)¯θ, ¯θ, t, k(cid:1) = 0
would set debtor’s expected proﬁts. But we also need an explicit solution for
t (θ), thus the investment rule ˆk (θ) is rewritten as

ˆk (θ) =

(cid:40)

1 if C ≥ B (θi) + Q (θ−i)
0 otherwise

B (θi) = θi +

F (θi)
φ (θi)

+

(cid:88)

j(cid:54)=i

ej (θi)

where

and

Q (θ−i) =

n
(cid:88)

(cid:88)

ej (θk) +

(cid:88)

(cid:20)
θj +

(cid:21)

F (θj)
φ (θj)

k(cid:54)=j,i
We make the following assumption so B (xi) is strictly increasing.

j(cid:54)=i

j=1

Assumption 1. F (θi) /φ (θi) is strictly increasing (i.e., monotonically non-
decreasing) for all θi ∈ (cid:2)θ, θ(cid:3) and all i = 1, . . . , N .

This assumption is satisﬁed by any uniform distribution on the interval

0 ≤ θ < θ < ∞, the Pareto, exponential, and positive normal distributions.

Thus, there exists a unique value of θi denoted by ˜θ = ˜θ (θ−i) for each vector

θ−i that solves

A = B (θi) + Q (θ−i)

12

!ה"!ב

The pivotal type ˜θ (θ−i) that creditor i can report without forcing bankruptcy
according to investment rule ˆk (θ) is large when low types θ−i are being reported
by the other creditors: it measures the magnitude of the opportunities for holding
out. It’s deﬁned by

(cid:40)

˜θ (θ−i) =

min θi|A =

n
(cid:88)

(cid:20)
θi + e (θ−i) +

i=1

(cid:21)(cid:41)

F (θi)
φ (θi)

Theorem 9. The payment to creditor i is calculated according to

ˆti (θi, θ−i) = ˆti (θ−i) = ˜θ (θ−i) + ei (θ−i)

in the optimal mechanism.

Proof. The investment rule ˆk (θ) can be rewritten by the deﬁnition of ˜θ (θ−i) as

k (θ) =

(cid:40)

1 for θi ≤ ˜θ (θ−i)
0 otherwise

Thus, the change in utility to creditor i from the optimal mechanism by constraint
3.6 is

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:105)

(3.13)

From the previous equation 3.13 and the change in the expected utility from

the non-optimal mechanism 3.2,

(cid:90)

In−1
(cid:90)

=

ˆk (θi, θ−i) ti (θi, θ−i) φ (θ−i) dθ−i

(cid:16)

(cid:104)˜θ (θ−i) − θi, 0

(cid:105)(cid:17)

φ (θ−i) dθ−i

(3.14)

(3.15)

In−1

Finally, we arrive to the solution to equation 3.15,

ˆti (θi, θ−i) = ˆti (θ−i) = ˜θ (θ−i) + ei (θ−i)

since ˜θ (θ−i) − θi < 0 when ˆk (θi, θ−i) = 0, and ˜θ (θ−i) − θi > 0 when ˆk (θi, θ−i) =
1.

In the optimal mechanism 9, a payment is received by creditor i which is
independent of the reported type, but it will depend on the types declared by
other creditors as explained in the following:

• the function ˜θ (θ−i) is decreasing in each component of θ−i .

13

!ה"!ב

• the function ei (θ−i) is increasing in each component of θ−i :

if other
creditors report high expected recovery values, then creditor i would
increase his own expected recovery value.

If the holding out from ˜θ (θ−i) dominates the revision of expectations from
ei (θ−i), then transfers are decreasing in each component of θ−i when using the
optimal mechanism.

4 Practical Implementation

To ease exposition, we consider the simplest case: consider an example with
n = 2 creditors and their private expected recovery value from bankruptcy θi be
uniformly distributed on [0, 1].

Assume that the revision function 3.1 is deﬁned by

(cid:18)

ei (θi) = α

θi −

(cid:19)

1
2

such that when the constant α > 1 creditors give more weight to the estimate of
other creditors, and vice versa.

The optimal continuation value is given by

(cid:40)

ˆk (θ) =

1 if A ≥ (θ1 + θ2) (1 + α) − α
0 otherwise

(4.1)

thus

˜θ (θ2) =

(cid:18) 4

(cid:19) (cid:16)

2 + α

A −

(cid:17)

α
2

− 2θ1

the payment to creditor 1 is

ˆt1 (θ2) = ˜θ (θ2) + e (θ2) =

and the payment to creditor 2 is

ˆt2 (θ1) = ˜θ (θ1) + e (θ1) =

(cid:19)

(cid:18) 4A − α2
2α + 4

(cid:19)

(cid:18) 4A − α2
2α + 4

− θ2 (1 − α)

(4.2)

− θ1 (1 − α)

(4.3)

Finally, the amount of debt forgiveness by each creditor i is given by d − θi.

4.1

Implementation on “The Secure Spreadsheet”

Figure 4.1: Screenshots from “The Secure Spreadsheet”. Top is creditor #1,
bottom is creditor #2.

The previously derived closed-form formulae for the probability of the debtor to
receive debt relief and continue being solvent 4.1, the payment to creditor #1
4.2 and to creditor #2 4.3 can be securely computed very easily on “The Secure
Spreadsheet” (USPTO Patent 10,423,806[Cer14]), available online for download
[Cer21b]: ﬁrst precognised in the article “The G-d Protocols” [Sza97] from 1997,
“The Secure Spreadsheet” is the ﬁrst and only user program for general-purpose
secure computation. For maximum performance at an aﬀordable cost, the
preferred secure computation protocol used by the “The Secure Spreadsheet” is
the dual-execution protocol[MF06]:

Theorem 10. (Dual-Execution protocol[HKE12]). If the garbled circuit con-
struction is secure against semi-honest adversaries and the hash function M is
modelled as a random oracle, then the Dual-Execution protocol securely computes
f implementing the ideal functionality FY OV EL 3.1 if for every non-uniform
probabilistic polynomial-time adversary A in the real model, there exists a non-
uniform probabilistic polynomial-time adversary S in the ideal model such that

(cid:110)

IDEALf,S(aux) (x, y, n)x,y,aux∈{0,1}∗

(cid:111) c

≡ (cid:8)REAL(cid:81),A(aux) (x, y, n)(cid:9)

x,y,aux∈{0,1}n

15

!ה"!ב

As pictured above on the captured screenshots 4.1, the public values for the
debt D, the continuation value C and the weight α to the estimate to the other
creditors must be the same on both spreadsheets for creditors 1 and 2. On the
top spreadsheet for creditor 1, the only private that is taken into account is
the one inputted by creditor 1 (et vice versa for the bottom spreadsheet for
creditor 2). The ﬁnal values computed using secure computation appear on the
right-hand side of the captured screenshots, under the column “SECCOMP”.

4.2

Implementation on a blockchain

The previous implementation on spreadsheets 4.1 is also realised on a blockchain
using Raziel [Cer17] smart contracts and Pravuil [Cer21a] consensus: identical
secure computations as the ones carried out on “The Secure Spreadsheet” are
executed among creditors and debtors interfacing the blockchain with a mobile
app.

Figure 4.2: Two secure computation groups forgiving debts on a blockchain

Note the special suitability of Pravuil [Cer21a] consensus integrating real-
world identity on this blockchain: debt management requires real-world identities,
otherwise Sybil attacks could create unlimited fake debts. Due to this reason,
this is the only valid blockchain consensus protocol [Cer21a] for the purpose of
debt management.

5 Conclusion

The present paper has tackled and successfully solved the problem of debt relief
and forgiveness by securely computing optimal debt settlements. The mathe-
matical proofs hereby provided demonstrate that participation in the proposed
mechanism is within the economically rational interests of all the involved par-
ties by truthfully providing their private information, thus removing the need
for third parties. Additionally, the provided implementations demonstrate the
practicality of the securely computed mechanism.
