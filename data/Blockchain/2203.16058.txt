ABSTRACT
Proof of work cryptocurrencies began with the promise of a more
egalitarian future with a decentralized monetary system with no
powerful entities in charge. While this vision is far from realized,
these cryptocurrencies are still touted to be much more decentral-
ized than traditional centralized systems. While it is well under-
stood that cryptocurrencies are centralized, it is still unclear what
the underlying causes are. This work aims to address this gap and
examines some of the forces behind mining centralization.

The internals of cryptocurrency mining are very opaque and dif-
ficult to study since it traditionally requires forming relationships
with miners, who are typically reticent to share internal information
about their competitive advantages. This work takes a different ap-
proach by combining large scale statistical techniques with publicly
available blockchain data in order to answer previously intractable
questions. The crux of our analysis technique is based on the simple
observation that some miners can utilize their hashpower more
efficiently due to their position in the network. By teasing out that
effect, we de-bias the mining power distribution to get a more accu-
rate estimate. Using that de-biased mining power distribution, we
can answer questions about the network position of miners in each
cryptocurrency network. Finally, during the course of this study,
we observed some unusual mining behaviors which we highlight.

1 INTRODUCTION
Proof of work cryptocurrencies are touted to be a trustless, censorship-
resistant form of money. The key value proposition is that there
is no individual or small group of entities that have control over
the entire currency. In particular, there must necessarily be many,
non-colluding miners that are processing transactions in order to
prevent any small group of them to enact policies that may break
censorship resistance. If there are only a few miners, then these
systems would be no different from an inefficient version of a cen-
tralized database.

The degree of mining centralization has been previously stud-
ied [1, 13, 34], and some of its underlying causes are understood.
For example, individual miners form mining pools and share re-
sources to reduce the variance of their block rewards. Another
source of mining centralization is the efforts miners spend to be
well positioned in the mining network, including making man-
ual connections to many nodes, multiple points of presence, and
even peering relationships between large miners to relay newly
mined blocks more quickly between them. While these behaviors
are well-known, the degree to which these behaviors affect mining
centralization is not well understood.

Understanding the effect of these behaviors requires making in-
ferences about the mining network. However, direct measurements
on mining networks are extremely difficult to conduct since miners

are privacy oriented. Indirect measurements to infer network prop-
erties is also often difficult and expensive [23]. This paper takes a
different approach using large scale statistical techniques on read-
ily available blockchain data to extract insights about the mining
network. Blockchain data has the benefits of direct measurement,
as the fields of a block are filled by the miner of that block, without
the difficulty of deploying a measurement probe and convincing
miners to run it.

The crux of our approach rests on the following simple, but
powerful, observation. Per the Nakamoto consensus rules, a miner
will transmit their newly mined block to all other miners in the
network. However, the transmission of their freshly mined block
takes time, dependent on their position in the network. Thus, the
miner of a newly mined blocks gains an advantage over all other
miners since it receives its own block first, an advantage we call
the previous block advantage. Thus, by looking at the blocks that
were mined immediately after a particular miner, we can infer how
well connected that miner is to all other miners in the network. A
particular advantage to this approach is that it relies on publicly
available blockchain data which makes it feasible for us to study
and compare six different cryptocurrency networks, the largest
such study to date.

We proceed with our measurement study in three distinct phases.
The first phase is the preliminary measurements and inferences.
We confirm that the hypothesized previous block advantage indeed
exists in the publicly available blockchain data. Once confirmed,
we note that the mining power distribution is biased due to the
previous block advantage, and we present a more unbiased mining
power estimate. An accurate mining power distribution is useful
for the community at large to detect when a miner is amassing a
large amount of hashpower and for miners to see how much they
are underutilizing their hashpower.

Then, our study moves on to answering detailed questions about
the mining network and its block propagation characteristics. Un-
derstanding block propagation is key to developers so they can
spend their energy optimizing the correct bottlenecks and make in-
formed decisions about key protocol parameters such as the block
size. Such decisions are very difficult as some cryptocurrencies,
such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have much faster net-
works than others that have larger block size limits, such as Bitcoin
Cash (BCH) or Bitcoin SV (BSV). The block size debate is extremely
contentious and is one of the reasons behind multiple chain splits.
Previous studies [7, 13] have proposed setting the blocksize by
measuring the bandwidth of the entire peer to peer network.

Our work takes an alternate approach to the block size question
by looking at the previous block advantage. Larger blocks propa-
gate through the network more slowly, so the position of a miner
in the network confers more of an advantage compared to smaller

blocks. However, depending on the network capacity, the thresh-
old for how large a block has to be to confer such an advantage
changes. This threshold is called the safe envelope of a cryptocur-
rency, which is formally defined as the maximum block size that
gives the same previous block advantage as an empty block. We
estimate this threshold for all cryptocurrencies and present a com-
parative analysis to show the effect of Ethereum network upgrades
in December 2019, which have helped decrease the previous block
advantage.

Finally, we examine some unusual miner behaviors in the min-
ing network, namely the formation of mining cartels and active
chain switching. We search and find examples of miner carteliza-
tion in ZCash and Litecoin, where mining pools are only nominally
separated into separate entities and functionally act as a single
larger mining pool. Cartels are dangerous as they provide the il-
lusion of decentralization rather than true decentralization. We
also examine one case of active chain switching, a behavior by
miners to switch between chains frequently in order to generate
the maximum returns on their mining power. Due to space con-
straints, we summarize the high level takeaways for the unusual
miner behaviors and defer detailed discussion to the appendix.

Our work illustrates how much data there is contained in the
blockchain itself and how we can leverage that data to answer
otherwise intractable questions about the mining network. Such
techniques have a significant advantage over conventional measure-
ment techniques since they do not require extensive, custom-built
measurement probes which allow for larger-scale studies. Through
these techniques, this work was able to extract a more accurate
estimate of the mining power distribution, provide guidance to
developers on how to measure the effects of an upgrade and set im-
portant protocol parameters, and find examples of unusual mining
behavior.

2 BACKGROUND
While cryptocurrencies today have drastically different designs [15,
29, 33], our study focuses on the subset that uses proof-of-work
based Nakamoto consensus [5, 12, 22, 24]. In this section, we cover
some of the more pertinent aspects of these cryptocurrencies to
our study.

2.1 Proof of Work Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies sequence transactions so that all honest partic-
ipants can agree on the history of transactions. This agreement
is reached in the presence of Byzantine actors in the network, as

long as the Byzantine actors are sufficiently weak. In particular,
Nakamoto consensus assumes that Byzantine actors are limited
to using at most a quarter of the total compute resources in the
network [11].

Transactions are sequenced in batches, called blocks. These blocks
are ordered by miners who append each batch to the tail of the
blockchain so that all blocks are consistently ordered. To append
a block, miners must first decide on its contents and then solve a
crypto puzzle in order to prove that they have spent a large amount
of computing resources. Our study relies on two pieces of informa-
tion that are attached to each block: the identity of the miner and
the timestamp. Miner identities are self-reported by the miners and
are not enforced by the protocol. Miners gain influence the more
blocks they mine, so, like prior work [13, 26, 41], we assume that
miner identity information is accurate.

Occasionally, miners attempt to insert a block into the same
location on the blockchain. Such events, called forks, occur when
one miner fails to hear of a recent block and has mined a block on
top of a stale blockchain. Some forks are inevitable in Nakamoto
consensus and most cryptocurrencies resolve forks through the
longest chain rule, where the longest chain of blocks is considered
valid. Most cryptocurrencies drop forked blocks as they are no
longer part of the agreed-upon history of events. Ethereum, on the
other hand, saves these forked blocks and rewards miners of forked
blocks using the GHOST [37] protocol, though the reward for a
forked block is significantly smaller. How often forks occur depends
on how long blocks take to propagate and the block interval, which
is how often blocks are mined. Table 1 presents summary statis-
tics on how large each system’s blocks are and the corresponding
effective throughput of the chain.

2.2 Miner Behaviors
Miners are rewarded when their blocks are incorporated into the
blockchain. As a result, miners innovate to find novel ways to trans-
mit blocks to and from all other miners. Miners, especially large
miners, often connect directly to each other to transmit block infor-
mation and optimistically start mining on top of a newly received
block without fully validating its contents. These relationships are
not necessarily symmetric as well, as a small miner may be willing
to optimistically mine a block from a larger miner while the reverse
may not be true. These relationships are typically forged directly
between miners and not openly accessible, which makes inferring

properties about the structure of the mining network extremely dif-
ficult. This makes answering questions about mining centralization
hard.

Miner behavior also becomes more complex when considering
the modern cryptocurrency ecosystem. When Bitcoin [24] was
first released, it was the only proof of work cryptocurrency in
existence, and miners consisted of home users mining on their
laptops. Modern miners use specialized hardware to mine most
large cryptocurrencies and have a choice in which cryptocurrency
to mine. Some coins, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH),
and Bitcoin SV (BSV), share the same crypto puzzle so specialized
hardware built for one coin can be redirected fairly easily to another
coin. Thus, miners may choose to switch between coins every so
often depending on how profitable it is to mine each one.

3 MEASUREMENT DATA
Our analysis relies on readily available blockchain data and uses
large scale statistical analysis to extract insights. In a given cryp-
tocurrency, we extract the following data from each block: (1) the
block height, which is determined by counting the number of blocks
preceding it in the blockchain, (2) the block size, which is the num-
ber of bytes in a block, (3) the block timestamp, which is the time
that the block was mined, and (4) the identity of the miner who
mined this block. This information is readily available on any block
explorer for a cryptocurrency. We collected data on Bitcoin (BTC),
Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Ethereum (ETH) and Lite-
coin (LTC) from BlockChair [39]. ZCash (ZEC) data was obtained
from the ZChain [40] block explorer. Summary statistics about the
block data used in our study are presented in Table 2.

Our target measurement period is August 2018 for most coins
and August 2019 for BSV, as BSV did not exist in 2018. As our
statistical techniques require larger amounts of data, we extend our
measurement period slightly before and after that time. We choose
the smallest time period as we assume that the mining hashpower is
relatively stable so that the differences we observe can be attributed
to the network.

Two of the fields we extract from the blockchain have potential
inaccuracies: the miner identities and the block timestamps, which
are both set by the miner of the block. Similar to prior work, we
believe the miner identities are accurate as large miners are able to
negotiate preferable peering relationships and otherwise influence
the network, so it in their best interest to claim their own blocks [13,
26, 41]. We validated the block timestamp data by checking whether

the timestamp field matched the time that the block was received
by the block explorer and ensuring that they were similar. As an
additional validation step, we ran a full node on some networks
such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and verified that the
block was received at a time similar to its timestamp.

To sanitize our data, we drop certain types of blocks. Smaller
miners, which we define as having mined less than 1% of the total
number of blocks in our sample, need to be dropped as our analysis
requires a large amount of data and small miners just have not pro-
duced very many blocks. Additionally, some blocks are unclaimed
and they also get dropped. These blocks are typically mined by
smaller miners, so we do not expect that ignoring unclaimed blocks
will affect the soundness of our analysis. We use all blocks in one
analysis where we are comparing the relative decentralization of
all cryptocurrencies in Section 4.1. The number of blocks dropped
in each cryptocurrency during sanitization is noted in Table 2. Note
that dropping blocks does not present an error in our measure-
ment, as our inferences are on the miners that were included in our
sample.

4 THE PREVIOUS BLOCK ADVANTAGE
When a miner mines a block, it receives the most recent copy of
the blockchain first and obtains an advantage in the race to mine
the next block, a phenomenon we call the previous block advantage.
The previous block advantage encourages mining centralization as
miners may choose to coalesce into larger miners or form peering
relationships in order to gain a more advantageous position in
the network. Thus, it is crucial to understand and quantify the
mechanics of the previous block advantage.

To understand the previous block advantage and its effect on
decentralization, we first need to quantify what we mean by decen-
tralization. We use a metric based on the Shannon entropy [19] to
compare how decentralized the mining power is between differ-
ent cryptocurrencies. Then, we verify whether or not the previous
block advantage exists in our dataset and introduce a metric to
quantify how prevalent it is across cryptocurrencies. Finally, we
eliminate the effect of the previous block advantage on the mining
power distribution in order to get a more accurate estimate of the
miner’s true hashpower. This allows us to examine the state of the
mining network more carefully in subsequent sections.

Table 3: The number of equally powered miners that would
have the same entropy as that cryptocurrency’s mining
power distribution.

4.1 Mining Power Distribution
The mining power distribution of each coin is the proportion of hash-
power owned by each miner on that coin. A miner with enough
hashpower can gain control of the cryptocurrency, censor trans-
actions, and ruin the value proposition of the cryptocurrency. To
measure decentralization, we compare the randomness present in
the mining power distribution with uniform distribution with 𝑛
miners. The larger 𝑛 is, the more decentralized the mining power
distribution is. To compute 𝑛, we take two to the power of the
Shannon entropy [19] in a manner similar to how the effective
anonymity set size is computed in anonymous communication
systems [36].

Blocks that were not claimed by any miner introduce a layer
of uncertainty in this computation. To handle these cases, we first
assume that unclaimed blocks do not belong to miners that have
claimed other blocks as their own. Then, the pessimistic case is
that the unclaimed blocks were all mined by a single miner, which
gives us a lower bound on 𝑛. Similarly, to get an upper bound on 𝑛,
we treat all unclaimed blocks to be mined by distinct miners. We
present the lower and upper bound of 𝑛 for all coins in our study
in Table 3.

Results. Similar to previous studies [13], we observe that none
of these coins are very decentralized. A consensus protocol with
fourteen equally powerful, independent members would be more
decentralized than the most decentralized cryptocurrency, ZEC.
However, even among this small range, there are fairly substantial
differences in decentralization across cryptocurrencies. The most
centralized coins, LTC and BSV, have the equivalent of four to five
equally powerful miners controlling their cryptocurrency. This is
two to three times more centralized than the most decentralized
coin, ZEC, which has about twelve to fourteen such miners.

4.2 Existence of Previous Block Advantage
We now ask the question of whether the hypothesized previous
block advantage exists in our dataset. To do this, we compute the
hashpower of a miner 𝑀 in two different ways. First, we use the
proportion of blocks that were mined by 𝑀 in the entire sample
period. Then, we use the proportion of blocks that were mined by
𝑀, but only when we look at blocks that were mined immediately
after 𝑀 mines a block. If the previous block advantage does not
exist, then both sample proportions should be equal, which is our
null hypothesis. We run a two proportion z-test to see if this is
indeed the case for each of the miners in the six cryptocurrencies
we studied. Note that the two samples are independent because the

miner of any particular block on the chain is chosen independently
at random from the set of all miners.

Table 4 shows the p-values from the two proportion z test with
statistically significant results shaded. As our data is fairly noisy,
we are more likely to make a type two error so we use a significance
level of 5%. Note that a Bonferroni correction [42] is not required
as each of our proportions are drawn from an independent set of
blocks so the result of one of our z tests has no effect on the result
of other tests.

Results. The previous block advantage is present across many
small and large miners, with 49% of miners across all cryptocurren-
cies obtaining a statistically significant advantage. If we consider
just the largest four miners in each cryptocurrency, 62.5% have
the previous block advantage, which shows the prevalence of this
advantage amongst larger miners.

Some cryptocurrencies have a stronger previous block advantage
than others. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) and ZCash (ZEC) have
very few advantaged miners, which may have to do with the design
of the corresponding network layers. Bitcoin has multiple relay
networks [6, 13] that help blocks propagate faster and alleviate
the previous block advantage. ZCash’s mining distribution is the
most decentralized out of any cryptocurrency, which is a potential
reason for ZEC’s low previous block advantage. In contrast, we see
that Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), and Ethereum (ETH)
has most, if not all, of the top miners benefitting from a statistically
significant previous block advantage.

The previous block advantage in ETH seems to extend to almost
every miner including smaller miners. This supports the existence
of centralization pressure in ETH due to the previous block advan-
tage. The likely explanation behind the prevalence of the previous
block advantage in ETH is due to the comparatively smaller block
interval in ETH. This makes it easier for our statistical tests to
detect the existence of the previous block advantage. The failure to
detect this in other cryptocurrencies is likely due to the larger block
interval causing a smaller sample size. All other metrics measuring
the prevalence of the previous block advantage do not show that
Ethereum is particularly facing this centralization pressure. As a
result, we believe that the previous block advantage is inherent to
proof of work mining.

Note that some standard mining practices, such as spy mining,
which occurs when a mining pool adds some of their mining power
to another pool to obtain block headers more quickly, will not
increase the previous block advantage. These practices are a way
for miners to reduce the block transmission time to the network,
which reduces the previous block advantage.

Caveats. Our data, especially among smaller miners, is fairly
noisy since they have mined comparatively few blocks. Thus, mak-
ing statistical inferences is more difficult as the previous block
advantage obtained by them would have to be quite large. However,
our results strongly suggest that the previous block advantage is
real and present in our dataset.

Succession Matrix. Since we know that the previous block
advantage exists, we systematically study these network effects
using the succession matrix of a cryptocurrency. To build the suc-
cession matrix, index each known miner in the cryptocurrency
as 𝑀1, 𝑀2, . . . 𝑀𝑛 where 𝑀𝑖 has more hashpower than 𝑀𝑗 if 𝑖 > 𝑗
based on the estimate from the full blockchain. 𝑆𝑖 𝑗 is computed

as the proportion of blocks that 𝑀𝑗 has mined when considering
only the blocks immediately following blocks mined by miner 𝑀𝑖 .
This matrix allows us to look at the previous block advantage that
miners obtain when mining after each other as well as themselves.
We include the succession matrices for all studied cryptocurrencies
in Figure 6 located in Appendix B.

4.3 Measuring the Previous Block Advantage
A metric to quantify the prevalence of the previous block advantage
is important as it allows us to compare how prevalent the advantage
is across cryptocurrencies as well as across the same cryptocurrency
over time. To reason about how to construct such a metric, we start
with the succession matrix. If miner 𝑀𝑗 gets a large previous block
advantage when some miner 𝑀𝑖 mines the previous block, then we
would expect the entry 𝑆𝑖 𝑗 to be large relative to the mining power
of 𝑀𝑗 . Thus, our first step to construct this metric is to normalize
the succession matrix to highlight how large the previous block
advantage is.

The normalized succession matrix 𝑁 is the matrix where 𝑁𝑖 𝑗 =
𝑆𝑖 𝑗
𝑚 𝑗 , where 𝑚 𝑗 is the mining power of miner 𝑀𝑗 . If 𝑁𝑖 𝑗 is larger
than one, then 𝑀𝑗 has a slight advantage when mining after 𝑀𝑖
mines a block and if 𝑁𝑖 𝑗 is smaller than one, 𝑀𝑗 is at a disadvan-
tage. We include the normalized succession matrix for all studied
cryptocurrencies in Figure 7 located in Appendix B.

A first attempt at such a metric might simply be to compare 𝑁𝑖𝑖
to 1 and add them up across all miners, i.e. (cid:205)𝑛
𝑖=1 (𝑁𝑖𝑖 − 1) where
𝑛 is the number of miners. However, that metric treats small and
large miners equally, which inaccurately describes the prevalence
of the previous block advantage. A miner gets the previous block
advantage every time they mine a block, so the more hashpower a
miner has, the more heavily they should be weighted. With that
intuition, if we let 𝑃𝑖 be the fraction of hashpower that 𝑀𝑖 controls,
our final distance metric is 𝐷 = (cid:205)𝑛
𝑖=1 (𝑁𝑖𝑖 − 1)𝑃𝑖 . A system with no
net previous block advantage will have 𝐷 ≤ 0.

Table 5: These are the metrics that describe how prevalent
the previous block advantage is in each cryptocurrency. The
first column uses the mining power distribution implied by
looking at the blockchain and the second column uses a de-
biased mining power distribution which we discuss in more
detail in Section 4.4.

Results. Table 5 shows the resulting distance metrics for all
cryptocurrencies in our study. BTC miners have a very small previ-
ous block advantage compared to other cryptocurrencies, which
is likely due to the small block size and the presence of multiple
fast relay networks that improve block propagation. Interestingly,
ETH has a fairly low previous block advantage metric even though
most ETH miners have a statistically significant previous block ad-
vantage. This lends credence to the theory that the previous block
advantage was more easily detectable in ETH due to the smaller
block interval. Finally, we see that outliers have a large effect on
these metrics. While many BCH miners do not obtain a significant
previous block advantage, our metric is large for BCH due to the
large previous block advantage obtained by BTC.TOP, which is one
of BCH’s largest miners.

On further investigation, the reason for this outlier is that BTC.TOP

does active chain switching between BCH and BTC. Thus, BTC.TOP
gets a previous block disadvantage of sorts: when BTC.TOP has not
mined the previous block, it is less likely to be mining on BCH and
is consequently less likely to mine the next block. This behavior

5

violates our assumption that the hashpower of each miner remains
constant throughout the measurement period. BTC.TOP is not as
influential of a miner in BTC compared to BCH and consequently
does not skew the conclusions we make for BTC as much. We
provide further evidence for BTC.TOP’s behavior in Section A.2.

4.4 Correcting for Previous Block Advantage
The proportion of blocks belonging to a miner on the main chain is
typically used to estimate their hashpower [13, 38]. However, the
previous block advantage skews these estimates as larger miners
have a larger advantage. Understanding the hashpower distribution
of each cryptocurrency is critical as miners who get too powerful
can be put under pressure to scale back their operations, such as
when a miner obtained 51% of the hashpower in Bitcoin in July
2014 [20]. In this section, we show how to correct for this effect in
order to more accurately estimate the mining power distribution.
Denote the 𝑛 miners of a cryptocurrency as 𝑀1, 𝑀2, · · · , 𝑀𝑛 and
the true, unbiased proportion of the mining power owned by miner
𝑀𝑖 is 𝑂𝑖 . Note that (cid:205)𝑛
𝑂𝑖 = 1, and that 𝑂𝑖 is the probability that
𝑖=1
𝑀𝑖 has mined a randomly selected block in the blockchain.

Let 𝛼𝑖 be the relative amount that 𝑀𝑖 ’s hashpower is increased
due to its previous block advantage. Thus, 𝑀𝑖 has a relative prob-
ability of 𝑂𝑖 + 𝛼𝑖 of mining the next block when it as mined the
previous block. Any other miner, 𝑀𝑗 , just has a relative probability
of 𝑂 𝑗 of mining the next block. To get the absolute probability that
any miner has mined a block, we renormalize the probabilities by
dividing by 1 + 𝛼𝑖 . Thus, we see that the probability that 𝑀𝑖 mines
a block immediately after mining the previous block is
. This
is also the diagonal entry 𝑆𝑖𝑖 in the successor matrix.

𝑂𝑖 +𝛼𝑖
1+𝛼𝑖

We now find an expression for the fraction of blocks mined
by 𝑀𝑖 on the main chain using 𝑂𝑖 and 𝛼𝑖 . Since 𝑀𝑖 has 𝑂𝑖 of the
hashpower, 𝑀𝑖 has a probability of 𝑂𝑖 to mine a particular block.
However, 𝑂𝑖 of the time, 𝑀𝑖 gets an additional 𝛼𝑖 probability to
mine the next block. Thus, we see that the relative probability of 𝑀𝑖
mining any block on the main chain is 𝑂𝑖 (1 + 𝛼𝑖 ). To renormalize,
we divide the relative probability by (cid:205)𝑛
𝑂𝑖 (1 + 𝛼 𝑗 ). Thus, the
proportion of blocks mined by 𝑀𝑖 on the main chain is

.
𝑂 𝑗 𝛼 𝑗
This is the proportion of blocks that were mined by 𝑀𝑖 on the
blockchain or the biased mining power estimate. We can solve
the resulting set of 2𝑛 linear equations in order to solve for 𝑂𝑖 , as
desired.

𝑂𝑖 (1+𝛼𝑖 )
𝑗 =1

1+(cid:205)𝑛

𝑗=1

Results. Table 6 shows the biased and corrected estimates for
the mining power distribution. As we expect, since large miners
have a bigger previous block advantage, their mining power was
overestimated when using solely the proportion of blocks on the
chain. Using the modified mining power distribution, we recompute
the normalized succession matrix. Figure 1 shows all normalized
succession matrices and the distance metrics introduced in Sec-
tion 4.3 are shown in Table 5. The recomputed values indicate that
there is a larger previous block advantage than we initially believed.
Small discrepancies in the mining power distribution matter im-
mensely to individual miners and underutilizing their hashpower
by even a tiny amount might equate to tens of thousands of dollars
lost. An accurate estimate of a miner’s hashpower and how advan-
taged they are in the network allows miners to understand how to
improve their mining operations.

Validation. As forked blocks are discarded and forgotten in
most cryptocurencies, this corrected mining power distribution
is not possible to validate. However, Ethereum’s forked blocks,
called uncle blocks, are stored and rewarded in accordance with the
GHOST [37] protocol. Uncle blocks can be stored on the chain much
later than when they are mined, which eliminates the previous
block advantage as the propagation of uncle blocks can be much
slower than regular blocks. Therefore, including uncle blocks when
computing the mining power distribution will also eliminate the
previous block advantage. We include a detailed comparison of
these two distributions in Table 8 in Appendix B. The high level
takeaway is that our technique provides a more accurate estimate of
the mining power distribution than simply using blocks on the main
chain, with discrepancies between the estimates being attributable
to noise.

5 BLOCK PROPAGATION
Understanding block propagation is key to resolving many core
debates in cryptocurrencies, from setting parameters like the block
size to deciding which parts of the codebase need to be optimized
for maximum impact. Using our techniques, we can provide in-
sights on how blocks propagate through the network and help
cryptocurrencies make data-driven decisions.

In this section, we first estimate the latency of block propagation
in each network using the succession matrix. Then, we introduce
and discuss the safe envelope of a cryptocurrency in order to show
how the previous block advantage changes with respect to block
size and how to evaluate changes to the network. The decision,
such as a network upgrade, actually achieved the desired effect.

5.1 Latency of Block Propagation
Block propagation speed affects many aspects of decentralization,
such as the prevalence of the previous block advantage and how
often forks occur. We can use the succession matrix to estimate
how long blocks take to travel from one miner to all other miners
in each cryptocurrency.

We can use a simplified model of block propagation to compute
the average latency, where miner 𝑀𝑖 mines a block that takes 𝐿
minutes to propagate to all other miners. If the average block in-
terval is 𝑡, then the miner 𝑀𝑖 effectively increases its proportion
𝐿
of the mining power by a factor of
𝑡 every time it mines. This
increase can also be computed from the succession matrix, 𝑆, as
well. If 𝑀𝑖 mines after itself 𝑆𝑖𝑖 of the time and has 𝑂𝑖 fraction of
the hashpower, its advantage is
. To find the average latency,
¯𝐿, we take the average advantage over all 𝑛 miners:

𝑆𝑖𝑖 −𝑂𝑖
𝑂𝑖

𝑛
∑︁

=

¯𝐿
𝑡

𝑆𝑖𝑖 − 𝑂𝑖

𝑂𝑖 =

𝑆𝑖𝑖 − 1

𝑖
Thus, the average latency is ¯𝐿 = (((cid:205)𝑛
𝑖 𝑆𝑖𝑖 ) − 1)𝑡.
Results. Table 7 presents the latency of each cryptocurrency
in minutes and the 95% confidence interval. The average latency
of BTC is particularly small, with the midpoint of the confidence
interval being slightly negative. Most other coins have a block
latency that is about 10 to 30 percent of their average block interval
time. Thus, it would be useful for many coins to focus on improving

Figure 1: These are the normalized succession matrices for all cryptocurrencies when using the debiased mining power distri-
bution to normalize the succession matrix.

Figure 2: This graph shows the prevalence of the previous block advantage of three coins compared to block size. A point
in this graph represents the interval of sizes from that point up to the next one. For example, the point at 0 in BTC’s line
consists of all blocks from 0 to 204800 bytes. The dotted line is used to estimate which interval the safe envelope for each
cryptocurrency lies.

their block propagation characteristics. BCH’s latency estimate is
also unnaturally high, and we discuss the reasons why below.

interval for the orphan rate is between 4% and 15%, also in line with
prior measurements.

Sanity Check. To check our latency results, we use the orphan
rate, which can be approximated as 1 − 𝑒 −𝜏
𝑇 , where 𝜏 is the average
latency between miners and 𝑇 is the block interval time [32]. From
prior measurement work in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)
networks, we see that the orphan rate for Bitcoin is extremely
small and Ethereum’s fluctuates between 6-10% [13]. From our
table above, we see that the orphan rate in BTC is very close to
zero which is in line with prior work. In ETH, the 95% confidence

Caveats. The largest caveat for our measurement comes from
the accuracy of the timestamp data that was collected from each
block. Since those are set by the miner, they are subject to manipu-
lation either due to benign reasons, such as clock skew, or malicious
actions by miners. To validate the timestamp data, we compared
them with the receive time in the block explorers and checked
the timestamps of some blocks on our full nodes for Bitcoin and
Ethereum.

tively, the average time between blocks, the latency to trans-
mit blocks, and the 95% confidence interval of that latency.

Our latency measurement is sensitive to outliers, which is why
BCH’s latency number is quite high at 2.68 minutes. The outlier in
the BCH data is the inflated previous block advantage that BTC.TOP
has due to its unusual mining behavior.

5.2 Safe Envelopes
Understanding how the block size affects decentralization has been
a critical debate in cryptocurrencies, is the root cause behind some
chain splits. To get at this question, we use the previous block
advantage metric from Section 4.3 and compute it on blocks after
grouping them by size.

We expect to see that the previous block advantage is small for
small blocks since small blocks take less time to propagate. However,
as the block size increases, the previous block advantage would get

Figure 3: This graph compares the prevalence of the previ-
ous block advantage across two snapshots of Ethereum that
are separated by a client upgrade improving block propaga-
tion.

larger. We define the safe envelope of a cryptocurrency as the last
block size range that does not have a significantly higher previous
block advantage relative to a block with no payload. Beyond the

8

safe envelope, increasing the block size directly encourages miners
to centralize as there is an increased previous block advantage.

Results. Figure 2 presents the previous block advantage for dif-
ferent block sizes. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval
for each block size. From the figure, we see that Bitcoin (BTC),
Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) have a safe envelope that
is beyond the block sizes that we have observed. In Bitcoin (BTC),
the range is likely due to a maximum block size that is too small
for the network. However, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash blocks are
not yet at their maximum block size, so the lack of a defined safe
envelope stems from underutilization not the block size limit. This
means that BTC can safely increase its block size, while LTC and
BCH users are free to utilize the chain more without risking mining
centralization.

On the other hand, we see that ZCash, Ethereum, and Bitcoin SV
all have a defined safe envelope. This means that they all operate at
a throughput that encourages some mining centralization. ZCash
has a safe envelope that ends somewhere between 10 KB and 50 KB
while Ethereum’s safe envelope ends somewhere between 32 KB
and 40 KB. Bitcoin SV’s safe envelope ends somewhere after 10 KB.
These are extremely coarse-grained estimates, which are limited
by the number of blocks in our sample.

Using the safe envelope, we can analyze the effects of significant
events through a concrete example. In December 2018, Ethereum
released a new client that improved the block propagation time on
the Ethereum network.

Figure 3 compares two different Ethereum snapshots: one from
just before the deployment and one from after the deployment when
most users had upgraded. Interestingly, we see that improving the
network layer does not always improve the safe envelope. Indeed,
the safe envelope in 2018 was between 24 KB and 32 KB while the
safe envelope in 2019 actually decreased to somewhere between 16
KB and 24 KB. However, if we look at the magnitude of our distance
metric, it has decreased for almost all block sizes. We therefore
conclude that the network upgrade improved decentralization in
the system as a whole even though the safe envelope has decreased.

6 UNUSUAL MINER BEHAVIORS
Using our analysis techniques, we have observed some miner cartels
in ZEC, BSV and LTC. Additionally, we have observed BTC.TOP
switching between BCH and BTC. We discuss how we reached those
conclusions and the methodology behind them in Appendix A.

7 RELATED WORK
Cryptocurrency measurement has been an active research area for
many years, starting with the work by Decker et al [8], which con-
nected to many peers in the Bitcoin network and measured block
propagation characteristics. Since then, traditional cryptocurrency
measurement studies have typically chosen a few questions to ask,
built a corresponding probe and then inferred properties of the peer
to peer network based on measurements made by their probe. Ad-
dressProbe [23] discovered peer-to-peer links in Bitcoin to analyze
the topology of the entire network, find connected components, and
find high degree nodes. The Falcon Relay Network and BMS [13]
was a blockchain measurement system to measure the network
properties of the nodes in the Bitcoin and Ethereum peer to peer

networks. TxProbe [9] cleverly used orphaned transactions in order
to take snapshots of Bitcoin’s testnet. NodeFinder [17] measured
the Ethereum network propagation characteristics in the peer to
peer network. Still, other measurement studies primarily focused
on Bitcoin [2, 14, 28] or Ethereum [16] through direct measurement.
However, while these techniques are very powerful in their own
right, they do have a few limitations. Prior techniques rely on a
snapshot of the network during a particular time period- it is impos-
sible to go back in time and answer historical queries. It is also very
difficult to effectively capture the effects of significant events, such
as an Ethereum network upgrade, since the measurement probe
must be running during the time of the event. Additionally, mea-
surement probes require significant manpower to build, run, and
maintain. Finally, measurement probes are fundamentally limited in
what types of questions they can answer as they can only be run on
nodes that are controlled by the researcher. Thus, gaining insights,
such as the structure of the mining network, is very difficult to do
with a traditional measurement probe.

Our large scale statistical analysis relies on infrastructure that
has already been built and maintained: the codebase of the cryp-
tocurrency itself. Leveraging this data is very powerful and sidesteps
all of the problems present in building custom measurement probes.
The codebase is always running and is running on every single node
in the network, which allows us to collect information from the
entire network at all times. However, our technique does require
a significant amount of data to make meaningful conclusions and
the estimates are more coarse-grained than they would be with a
measurement probe.

Prior work also verifies our conclusions as well. For example,
we are not the first paper to note the centralization of the mining
distribution [13]. Other works [2, 14] show recent events in Bitcoin
are showing the limits of its decentralized nature and how Bitcoin
is slowly becoming centralized. Our analysis on block propagation
also suggests that the Bitcoin is underutilizing its bandwidth and
that the network can use more bandwidth without compromis-
ing decentralization, a conclusion that has been made using prior
measurement probes as well [7, 13].

While many measurement studies have focused on the largest
cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, there has been some prior
work looking at properties of other cryptocurrencies as well. For
example, some work has done a comparative financial and statisti-
cal analysis between Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and Ethereum [35].
Additionally, others have compared Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple
on their architecture, scripting language and other crucial prop-
erties [21]. There have also been in-depth studies on comparing
the different consensus mechanisms [3, 4]. However, to our knowl-
edge, we are the first known measurement study incorporating six
different cryptocurrencies.

In our work, we looked at the safe envelope in order to deduce
whether or not it was safe to increase the block size in each cryp-
tocurrency. However, other, more effective ways of scaling cryp-
tocurrencies have been proposed as well which optimize all parts
of the cryptocurrency stack. Starting at the bottom, the peer to peer
network has many suggested optimizations that make the block
and transaction propagation more efficient [25, 27]. In the consen-
sus layer, many consensus protocol changes have been proposed
for Bitcoin that keep the same security guarantees as Nakamoto

9

consensus while increasing the throughput of the system [10, 18].
Finally, other proposals look at removing transactions from the
blockchain altogether and only use the blockchain as a conflict
resolution mechanism [30, 31]. In all of these proposals, however,
measuring the safe envelope is critically important so that there
is empirical evidence whether or not the new technology actually
made a meaningful change to the underlying system.

8 CONCLUSION
This paper rests on a single, crucial observation: mining a block
gives the corresponding miner a slight, but measurable advantage
when mining the next block. Leveraging this insight is extremely
powerful and allows us to answer difficult to answer questions
about the internals of the network that connects miners. This, in
turn, allows us to provide actionable intelligence to miners and
developers to see where they should spend their efforts in order
to achieve their objectives. With these techniques, we were able
to compute a more accurate mining power distribution, answer
questions about block propagation including how block size affects
the previous block advantage, and observe some interesting miner
behaviors like miner cartelization and active chain switching.

A UNUSUAL MINER BEHAVIORS
We now present two interesting miner behaviors present in our
dataset. First, we discuss miner cartelization when two miners are
interconnected and essentially function as a single miner. Next, we
discuss the behavior of BTC.TOP and active chain switching.

A.1 Miner Cartelization
Miner cartels are groups of miners that are nominally separate, but
act like a single entity separate from the rest of the mining network.
Such miners would preferentially send their blocks to each other
and may have dedicated links between each other. When such
behavior happens, miners in the cartel receive blocks from each

on BTC when BTC.TOP was mining BCH and vice versa. However,
this does not fully explain BTC.TOP’s large gaps when we look at
its mining behavior on BCH as we do not see a large previous block
advantage for BTC.TOP in BTC. In general, strategic mining behav-
ior that affects when their blocks appear will be detrimental to our
analysis and is a limitation of our techniques. However, we see that
this kind of behavior is not very common in the cryptocurrencies
we have studied.

B FIGURES AND TABLES
In this section, we include more detailed figures and tables to sup-
port the claims made in the main body of the paper.

other before everyone else. Miner cartels are dangerous because
they make the cryptocurrency appear more decentralized than it
actually is. Detecting cartels allows the community to understand,
and perhaps take action, if the cryptocurrency is becoming too
centralized.

Miners in a cartel receive a previous block advantage anytime
another miner in the same cartel mines a block. Thus, we would
expect to see very high values for miners in a cartel in the normal-
ized succession matrix. To highlight cartel miners more clearly, we
modify the normalized succession matrix, 𝑁 , as follows.

Suppose we have two miners, 𝑀𝑖 and 𝑀𝑗 , that belong to the
same cartel. That means that 𝑀𝑖 gets an advantage whenever 𝑀𝑗
mines a block, and vice versa. Consequently, 𝑁𝑖 𝑗 and 𝑁 𝑗𝑖 must both
be much larger than one, so we can analyze pairs of miners in the
− 1. High positive values imply
same cartel by computing
that 𝑀𝑖 and 𝑀𝑗 may be in the same cartel. We present this in a pairs
𝑁𝑖 𝑗 +𝑁 𝑗𝑖
matrix, 𝑃, where 𝑃𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑃 𝑗𝑖 =
− 1. If there were no miner
2
cartels, then we would expect 𝑃 to contain solely elements very
close to 0.

Results Figure 4 shows the pairs matrix only for cryptocurren-
cies that are noteworthy in some way. In ZEC, we see that miner0
and miner5 are likely part of the same cartel. Additionally, all BSV
miners are getting some previous block advantage, but no explicit
cartels have formed. In LTC, there seems to be another likely cartel
between LTC.TOP and litecoinpool.org, but this is not as extreme
as the one in ZEC.

Miner centralization, while a problem, is possible to detect and
base decisions on, such as users selling off tokens if a coin is too
centralized. However, miner cartels are more insidious as they give
the illusion of decentralization while hiding a system that is much
more centralized in nature. Our techniques make it easy to detect
cartels so that it is possible to detect and base decisions on.

A.2 Active Chain Switching
In Nakamoto consensus, miners are rewarded every time they mine
a block in the cryptocurrency they are mining. To remain profitable,
miners use specialized hardware that is optimized for the proof
of work function for their target cryptocurrency. For example, in
our study, a Bitcoin (BTC) miner can easily switch to Bitcoin Cash
(BCH) or Bitcion SV (BSV) as they all share the same proof of
work function. Thus, miners are incentivized to switch between
cryptocurrencies depending on the prices at the time.

Our analysis assumes that the network hashrate is relatively
consistent across our measurement period, so if miners frequently
actively chain switch, that would violate our assumption. In par-
ticular, we assume that taking the sample of blocks on the chain
immediately succeeding a miner’s blocks would give us a represen-
tative subsample of all blocks on the chain. When a miner is actively
chain switching, they are more likely to mine after themselves since
the fact that a block of theirs appears on the chain implies that they
are currently mining on this cryptocurrency. This makes it more
likely that they mine the next block, which will show up in our
dataset as an exceedingly large previous block advantage.

A potential example of such a miner is BTC.TOP in BCH, who
may be active chain switching between BTC and BCH. If we look at
BTC.TOP’s blocks in Figure 5, we see that few blocks were mined

Table 8: To validate our debiasing technique to estimate the real mining power, we look at the estimated mining power distribu-
tion on Ethereum by including uncle blocks. The rows in this table contain, respectively, the identity of the miner, the miner’s
estimated hashpower using just blocks on the blockchain, the de-biased hashpower using our technique, and the estimated
hashpower using both blocks and uncles.

Figure 5: We see that BTC.TOP is likely chain switching between BTC and BCH by looking at the timestamps of when BTC.TOP
blocks were mined in BTC and BCH.
