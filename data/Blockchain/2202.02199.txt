Abstract. The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is viewed as one of the im-
portant applications of blockchain technology. Currently NFT has a large
market scale and multiple practical standards, however several limita-
tions of the existing mechanism in NFT markets still exist. This work pro-
poses a novel securitization and repurchase scheme for NFT to overcome
these limitations. We ﬁrst provide an Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)
solution to settle the limitations of non-fungibility of NFT. Our securiti-
zation design aims to enhance the liquidity of NFTs and enable Oracles
and Automatic Market Makers (AMMs) for NFTs. Then we propose a
novel repurchase protocol for a participant owing a portion of NFT to
repurchase other shares to obtain the complete ownership. As the partic-
ipants may strategically bid during the acquisition process, we formulate
the repurchase process as a Stackelberg game to explore the equilibrium
prices. We also provide solutions to handle diﬃculties at market such as
budget constraints and lazy bidders.

Introduction

Ever since the birth of the ﬁrst piece of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) [10] [22],
the world has witnessed an extraordinarily fast growth of its popularity. NFT
markets, especially Opensea5, have prospered with glamorous statistics of a total
of over 80 million pieces of NFTs on the platform and a total transaction volume
of over 10 billion US dollars.6

NFT is a type of cryptocurrency that each token is non-fungible. The ﬁrst
standard of NFT, ERC-721 [9], gives support to a type of tokens that each has
a unique identiﬁer. The feature of uniqueness makes NFTs usually be tied to
speciﬁc assets, such as digital artwork and electronic pets. Some researches also
explore the application of NFT in patent, copyright and physical assets [5] [19].
The technology of NFT has also advanced rapidly. Besides ERC-721, ERC-
1155 [8] is also a popular standard of NFT. ERC-1155 is a ﬂexible standard
that supports multiple series of tokens, each series is a type of NFT or Fungible
Token (FT). NFT protocols are usually derived by smart contracts in a per-
missionless blockchain, but there are now some NFT designs for permissioned
blockchains [11].

Although NFT has a large market scale and multiple practical standards,
there still exist several limitations in NFT market, one of which is the poor
liquidity.

The issue of liquidity is crucial in both De-ﬁ and traditional ﬁnance. Usu-
ally, if assets have higher liquidity, they would have higher trading volume, and
further have higher prices [2]. Particularly, in blockchain, the liquidity of Fun-
gible Tokens, such as wBTC and ETH, has been enhanced by Oracles [16] and
Automated Market Makers (AMMs) [3] like Uniswap and Sushiswap. However,
the non-fungibility property of NFT leads to poor liquidity. For this reason, the
existing NFT marketplace usually uses the English Auction or Dutch Auction
to trade NFTs [13].

– Firstly, Non-Fungibility means indivisible.

As the NFT series with the highest market value, CryptoPunks has an av-
erage trading price of 189 Eth7, which is worth more than 790, 000 U.S.
dollars8. If bitcoins are expensive, we can trade 0.01 bitcoins, but we can’t
trade 0.01 CryptoPunks. As a result, the liquidity of CryptoPunks is signif-
icantly lower than other NFT series. Therefore, the liquidity for NFTs with
high values is limited.

– Secondly, shared ownership is not allowed because of Non-Fungibility. There-
fore, it’s diﬃcult to reduce risk and enhance the liquidity of NFTs through
portfolios. What’s more, Some NFT assets such as patents need ﬁnancial
support to foster the process of development. They would require a means
to attract ﬁnance. The above two limitations also exist in traditional settings.
– Thirdly, the feature of non-fungible makes NFT unable to be directly ap-
plied in Oracles [16] and Automated Market Makers (AMMs) [3], which are
important methods of pricing in the blockchain. This is because fungibility
is the basis of Oracles and AMMs.

1.1 Main Contributions

We present ABSNFT, a securitization and repurchase scheme for NFT, which
overcomes the above-mentioned limitations from the following three aspects.

– Firstly, we propose an Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) [4] solution to settle
the limitations of non-fungibility of NFT. We design a smart contract includ-
ing three parts: NFT Securitization Process, NFT Repurchase Process, and
NFT Restruction Process. In our smart contract, a complete NFT can be se-
curitized into fungible securities, and fungible securities can be reconstructed
into a complete NFT.
The securitization process manages to resolve the majority of issues the
current NFT application is confronted with: the securities of NFT have lower
values compared to the complete one before securitization, which increases
market liquidity; securities could act as fungible tokens that can be applied
in Oracles and AMMs; the investment risk is being reduced dramatically;
ﬁnancing is possible since securities can belong to diﬀerent owners.

– Secondly, we design a novel repurchase process based on Stackelberg game [20],
which provides a mechanism to repurchase NFT securities at a fair price.
The NFT Repurchase Process can be triggered by the participant who owns
more than half of the securities of the NFT. We analyze the Stackelberg
Equilibrium (SE) in three diﬀerent settings and get good theoretical results.
– Thirdly, we propose solutions to the budget constraints and lazy bidders,
which make good use of the decentralization of blockchain. We propose a
protocol that allows participants to accept ﬁnancial support in the repur-
chase game to reduce the inﬂuence of budget constraints. We also propose
two solutions for players that might not bid in the game, which prevent the
game process from being blocked and protect the utility of lazy bidders.

1.2 Related Works

In ﬁnancial research, there are two well-studied repurchase scenarios, repurchase
agreement and stock repurchase.

Repurchase agreement is a short-term transaction between two parties in
which one party borrows cash from the other by pledging a ﬁnancial security
as collateral [1]. The former party is called the security issuer, and the latter
party is called the investors. To avoid the failure of liquidation, the security
issuer needs to mortgage assets or credit. An instance of such work from the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York Quarterly Review introduces and analyzes
a repurchase agreement for federal funds [15]. The Quarterly Review describes
the repurchase agreement as “involving little risk”, as either parties’ interests
are been safeguarded.

Studies of repurchase agreement cannot be directly applied to our topic. The
key point is that the problem we are studying is not to mortgage NFTs to obtain
cash ﬂow, but to securitize NFTs to overcome the restrictions of non-fungibility.
What’s more, the repurchase prices are usually derived from the market model.

4

Hongyin Chen et al.

But the NFT market is not as mature as the ﬁnancial market, which makes it
hard to calculate a fair price through the market model.

Stock repurchase refers to the behavior that listed companies repurchase
stocks from the stockholders at a certain price [7]. Usually, stock repurchase is
adopted to release positive signals to the stock market and doesn’t aim to repur-
chase all stocks. However, NFTs usually need to be complete without securities
in cross-chain scenarios.

Oxygen [17] is a decentralized platform that supports repurchase agreement
based on digital assets. In Oxygen, users can borrow cash ﬂow or assets with
good liquidity by pledging assets with poor liquidity. The repurchase prices and
the evaluations of assets are provided by a decentralized exchange, Serum [18].
However, such pricing method is dangerous because decentralized exchanges are
very vulnerable to attacks like ﬂash loans [21].

ABSNFT is distinguished among all these works because it adapts well to

the particularities of NFT market and blockchain.

– First, the securities in ABSNFT represent property rights rather than cred-
itor’s rights. Investors do not need to worry that the cash ﬂow or the mort-
gaged assets of the securities issuer may not cover the liquidation, which may
be risky in a repurchase agreement. What’s more, any investor can trigger a
repurchase process as long as he owns more than half of the shares.

– Second, the repurchase process of ABSNFT doesn’t depend on market mod-
els or exchanges. The repurchase price is decided by the bids given by partic-
ipants, and every participant won’t get negative utility if he bids truthfully.
– Third, ABSNFT has well utilized the beneﬁts of blockchain technology. The
tradings of securities are driven by the smart contract. The operations of
ABSNFT don’t rely on centralized third-party and are available 24 × 7 for
participants.

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces the NFT
securitization process. In Section 3 and Section 4, we study the two-player repur-
chase game in a single round and the repeated setting. In Section 5, we analyze
the repurchase game with multiple leaders and one follower. In section 6, we
discuss the solution to the issues with budget constraints and lazy bidders in
the blockchain setting. In the last section, we give a summary of ABSNFT and
propose some future works.

2 NFT Securitization and Repurchase Scheme

In this section, we would like to introduce the general framework of the smart
contract, denoted by CN F T , which includes the securitization process, the trad-
ing process, repurchase process and restruction process for a given NFT.

2.1 Basic Setting of NFT Smart Contract

There are two kinds of NFTs discussed in this paper.

– Complete NFT. Complete NFTs are conventional non-fungible tokens,
which appear in blockchain systems as a whole. Each complete NFT has
a unique token ID. We use CN F T (id) to denote one complete NFT with
token ID of id.

– Securitized NFT. Securitized NFTs are the Asset Based Securities of
complete NFTs. A complete NFT may be securitized into an amount of secu-
ritized units. All units of securitized NFTs from a complete NFT CN F T (id)
have the same ID, associated with the ID of CN F T (id). Thus we denote the
securitized NFT by SN F T (id). In our smart contract, all securitized NFTs
can be freely traded.

In our setting, all complete NFTs and securitized NFTs belong to one smart
contract, denoted by CN F T . Although the securitized NFTs are similar to the
fungible tokens in ERC-1155 standard [8], our smart contract CN F T is actually
quite diﬀerent from ERC-1155 standard. That is because all securitized NFTs
in CN F T , associated to one complete NFT, have the same ID, while diﬀerent
NFTs and diﬀerent fungible tokens generally have diﬀerent token IDs in ERC-
1155 standard. Therefore, our CN F T is based on ERC-721 standard [9], and the
complete NFTs are just the NFTs deﬁned in ERC-721. Table 1 lists all functions
in CN F T .

Hongyin Chen et al.

The task of smart contract CN F T includes securitizing complete NFTs, trad-
ing the securitized NFTs among participants, and restructing complete NFT
after repurchasing all securitized NFTs with the same ID. Bescause the trans-
actions of securitized NFTs are similar to those of fungible tokens, we omit the
trading process here and introduce NFT securitization process, NFT repurchse
process and NFT restruction process in the subsequent three subsections respec-
tively.

2.2 NFT Securitization Process

This subsection focuses on the issue of Asset-Backed Securities for Complete
NFTs. We propose Algorithm 1 to demonstrate the NFT securitization process.
To be speciﬁc, once CN F T securitization(addr, id, amount) is triggered by the
owner of CN F T (id), the amount units of securitized NFTs are generated and
transferred to address addr in Line 2-4; then the ownership of CN F T (id) would
be transferred to a ﬁxed address F rozenAddr in Line 5.

It is worth to note that if Repurchase(id) has not been triggered, securitized

NFTs can be freely traded in blockchain system.

(cid:46) Freeze CN F T (id)

2.3 NFT Repurchase Process

After the securitization process, a complete NFT CN F T (id) is securitized into
M units of SN F T (id). Suppose that there are k+1 participants, N = {N0, · · · , Nk},
each owning mi units of SN F T (id). Thus (cid:80)k
i=0 mi = M . If there is one par-
ticipant, denoted by N0, owing more than half of SN F T (id) (i.e. m0 > 1
2 M ),
then he can trigger the repurchase process by trading with each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k.
Majority is a natural requirement for a participant to trigger a repurchase mech-
anism, and thus our repurchase mechanism sets the threshold as 1
2 . In addition,
if the trigger condition is satisﬁed (i.e., someone holds more than half of shares),
then there must be exactly one participant who can trigger the repurchase mech-
anism. This makes our mechanism easy to implement. Our mechanism also works
well if the threshold is larger than 1
2 .

Let vi be Ni’s value estimate for one unit of SN F T (id) and pi be the bid
provided by Ni, i = 0, · · · , k, in a deal. Specially, our smart contract CN F T
requires each value vi ∈ {1, · · · } and bid pi ∈ {0, 1, · · · } to discretize our analysis.

ABSNFT

7

We assume that the estimation of vi is private information of Ni, not known to
others. The main reason is that most of NFT objects, such as digital art pieces,
would be appreciated diﬀerently in diﬀerent eyes.

Participants may have diﬀerent opinions about a same NFT, which makes
each of them has a private value vi. Without loss of generality, we assume that
Ni’s private value on the complete NFT is M · vi.

Mechanism 1 (Repurchase Mechanism) Suppose participant N0 owes more
than half of SN F T (id) and triggers the repurchase mechanism. For the repur-
chase between N0 and Ni, i = 1, · · · , k,

– if p0 ≥ pi, then N0 successfully repurchases mi units of SN F T (id) from Ni

at the unit price of p0+pi

;

2

– if p0 ≤ pi − 1, then N0 fails to repurchase, and then he shall sell mi units
, and N0 obtains a

of SN F T (id) to Ni. The unit price that Ni pays is p0+pi
discounted revenue p0+pi−1
for each unit of SN F T (id).

2

2

Mechanism 1 requires that the repurchase process only happens between N0
and Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. If p0 ≥ pi, then N0 successfully repurchases mi units of
SN F T (id) from Ni, and the utilities of N0 and Ni are

U i

0(p0, pi) = mi(v0 −

p0 + pi
2

), Ui(p0, pi) = mi(

p0 + pi
2

− vi), if p0 ≥ pi. (1)

If p0 < pi, then N0 fails to repurchase from Ni, and the utilities of N0 and Ni
are

U i

0(p0, pi) = mi(

p0 + pi − 1
2

− v0), Ui(p0, pi) = mi(vi −

p0 + pi
2

), if p0 ≤ pi − 1.(2)

All participants must propose their bids rationally under Mechanism 1. If
the bid p0 is too low, N0 would face the risk of repurchase failure. Thus, the
securities of N0 would be purchased by other participants at a low price, and
N0’s utility may be negative. Similarly, if bid pi of Ni, i = 1, · · · , k, is too high,
Ni would purchase securities with an extra high price and get negative utility.
However, if a participant bids truthfully, he always obtains non-negative utility.
During the repurchase process, the key issue for each participant is how to bid
pi, i = 0, · · · , k, based on its own value estimation. To solve this issue, we would
model the repurchase process as a stackelberg game to explore the equilibrium
pricing solution in the following Section 3 to 5.

2.4 NFT Restruction Process

Once one participant successfully repurchases all securitized NFTs, he has the
right to trigger CN F T restruction(addr, id), shown in Algorithm 2, to burn
these securitized NFTs in Line 3 to 4 and unfreeze CN F T (id), such that the
ownership of CN F T (id) would be transferred from address F rozenAddr to this
participant’s address addr in Line 5.

After NFT restruction, all SN F T (id) are burnt, and CN F T (id) is unfrozen.

The owner of CN F T (id) has the right to securitize it or trade it as a whole.

3 Two-Player Repurchase Stackelberg Game

This section discusses the repurchase process for a two-player scenario. To be spe-
ciﬁc, in the two-player scenario, when a player owns more than half of SN F T (id),
denoted by N0, he will trigger the repurchase process with another player N1. To
explore the optimal bidding strategy for both players, we model the repurchase
process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which N1 acts as the leader to set
its bid p1 in Stage I, and N0, as the follower, decides its bid p0 in Stage II. Recall
that all bids and all values are in {0, 1, · · · }.

(1) N0’s bidding strategy in Stage II: Given the bid of p1, set by N1 in Stage I,

N0 decides its bid to maximize its utility, which is given as:

(cid:40)

U0(p0, p1) =

m1(v0 − p0+p1
2
m1( p0+p1−1

)
− v0)

2

if p0 ≥ p1;
if p0 ≤ p1 − 1.

(3)

(2) N1’s bidding strategy in Stage I: Once obtain the optimal bid p∗

0(p1) of N0
in Stage II, which is dependent on p1, N1 goes to compute the optimal bid
p∗
1 by maximizing his utility function maxp1 U1(p∗

0(p1), p1), where

U1(p0, p1) =

(cid:40)

m1( p0+p1
2 − v1)
m1(v1 − p0+p1
)

2

if p1 ≤ p0;
if p1 ≥ p0 + 1.

(4)

3.1 Analysis under Complete Information

(1) Best response of N0 in Stage II. Given the bid p1 provided by N1, in
Stage II, N0 shall determine the best response p∗

0(p1) to maximize his utility.

Lemma 1. In the two-stage Stackelberg game for repurchase process, if the bid
p1 is given in Stage I, the best response of N0 in Stage II is

(cid:40)

p∗
0(p1) =

p1 − 1
p1

if p1 ≥ v0 + 1
if p1 ≤ v0

(5)

Proof. According to (3), U0 is monotonically increasing when p0 ≤ p1 − 1 and
monotonically decreasing when p0 ≥ p1. So p∗
0(p1) ∈ {p1 − 1, p1}. In addition,
when p1 ≥ v0 + 1, we have

U0(p0 = p1, p1) = m1(v0 − p1) < 0 ≤ m1(p1 − 1 − v0) = U0(p0 = p1 − 1, p1).

ABSNFT

9

It implies that the best response of N0 is p∗
p1 ≤ v0, we have

0(p1) = p1 − 1 if p1 ≥ v0 + 1. When

U0(p0 = p1, p1) = m1(v0 − p1) ≥ 0 > m1(p1 − 1 − v0) = U0(p0 = p1 − 1, p1).

So under the situation of p0 ≤ v0, the best response of N0 is p∗

0(p1) = p1.

(cid:117)(cid:116)

(2) The optimal strategy of N1 in Stage I. The leader N1 would like to
optimize his bidding strategy to maximize his utility shown in (4).

Lemma 2. In the two-stage Stackelberg game for repurchase process, the opti-
mal bidding strategy for the leader N1 is

p∗
1 =

(cid:40)

v0
v0 + 1

if v1 ≤ v0
if v1 ≥ v0 + 1.

(6)

Proof. Based on Lemma 1, we have

U1(p∗

0(p1), p1) =

(cid:40)

m1(p1 − v1)
m1(v1 − p1 + 1
2 )

if p1 ≤ v0;
if p1 ≥ v0 + 1.

Thus U1 is monotonically increasing when p1 ≤ v0 and monotonically decreasing
when p1 ≥ v0 + 1, indicating the optimal bidding strategy p∗
1 ∈ {v0, v0 + 1}. In
addition, for the case of v0 ≥ v1, if p1 = v0, then p∗
0(p1) = p1 = v0 by Lemma
1 and U1(v0, v0) = m1(v0 − v1) ≥ 0. On the other hand, if p1 = v0 + 1, then
0(p1) = p1 − 1 = v0 by Lemma 1 and U1(v0, v0 + 1) = m1(v1 − v0 − 1
p∗
2 ) < 0.
Therefore, U1(v0, v0) > U1(v0, v0 + 1), showing the optimal bidding strategy of
N1 is p∗
1 = v0 when v0 ≥ v1. Similarly, for the case of v0 ≤ v1 − 1, we can
conclude that p∗
(cid:117)(cid:116)

1 = v0 + 1. This lemma holds.

Combining Lemma 1 and 2, the following theorem can be derived directly.

Theorem 1. When v0 ≥ v1, there is exactly one Stackelberg equilibrium where
p∗
1 = p∗
0 = v0. And when v0 ≤ v1 − 1, there is exactly one Stackelberg equilibrium
where p∗
0 = v0, p∗

1 = v0 + 1.

Furthermore, the following theorem demonstrates the relation between Stack-

elberg equilibrium and Nash equilibrium.

Theorem 2. Each Stackelberg equilibrium in Theorem 1 is also a Nash equilib-
rium.

The proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Appendix A.

3.2 Analysis of Bayesian Stackelberg Equilibrium

In the previous subsection, the Stackelberg equilibrium is deduced based on the
complete information about the value estimate v0 and v1. However, the value
estimates may be private in practice, which motivates us to study the Bayesian

10

Hongyin Chen et al.

Stackelberg game with incomplete information. In this proposed game, although
the value estimate vi is not known to others, except for itself Ni, i = 0, 1, the
probability distribution of each Vi is public to all. Here we use Vi to denote
the random variable of value estimate. Based on the assumption that all Vi
are integers, we continue to assume that each Ni’s value estimate Vi has ﬁnite
integer states, denoted by v1
i , and its discrete probability distribution
is P ro(Vi = vl
(1) Best response of N0 in Stage II. Because v0 is deterministic to N0, and
p1 is given by N1 in Stage I, Lemma 1 still holds, so

if p1 ≤ v0;
if p1 ≥ v0 + 1.

Based on the probability distribution of V0, the expected utility of U1 is:

4 Repeated Two-Player Stackelberg Game

This section would extend the study of the one-round Stackelberg game in the
previous section to the repeated Stackelberg game. Before our discussion, we con-
struct the basic model of a repeated two-player Stackelberg game by introducing
the necessary notations.

Deﬁnition 1. Repeated two-player Stackelberg repurchase game is given by a
tuple Gr = (M, N, V, S, L, P, U ), where:

– N = {N0, N1} is the set of two participants. The role of being a leader or a

follower may change in the whole repeated process.

– M is the total amount of SN F T (id). W.l.o.g., we assume that M is odd,

such that one of {N0, N1} must have more than half of SN F T (id).

– V = {v0, v1} is the set of participants’ value estimates. Let vi ∈ {1, 2, 3, · · · }

be an integer.

The detailed expressions of Ui will be proposed later.

In practice, vi, i = 0, 1, may not be common information. However, we can
extract them from the historical interaction data of the repeated game by on-
line learning [23] or reinforcement learning [14] methods. Therefore, we mainly
discuss the case with complete information in this section.
Repeated Stackelberg Game Procedure Repeated game Gr consists of sev-
eral rounds, and each round contains two stages. In the j-th round,

Proof. For the j-th round, let Ni = lj be the leader and thus N1−i is the follower.
Since there are only two players, all SN F T (id) will belong to one player, if the
follower can successfully repurchase SN F T (id) from the leader, and then the
repeated game stops. It means that in the j-th round, mj
i units of SN F T (id) is
bought by N1−i from Ni and the game stops at the terminal state z1−i. So if the

Combining Lemma 3 and Lemma 4, we have the following conclusion.

Lemma 5. If there is a Stackelberg equilibrium in the two-player repeated Stack-
elberg game, then U0 + U1 ≥ 0 in this Stackelberg equilibrium.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that U0 +U1 < 0 in this Stackelberg equilibrium,
then there must exist i ∈ {0, 1}, such that Ui < 0. However, by Lemma 3, we
know that if each player sets its price as pj
i ≥ 0. Hence
Ni can obtain more utility by setting pj
i = vi, which is a contradiction that Ni

doesn’t give the best response in this Stackelberg equilibrium.

Lemma 6. If there is a Stackelberg equilibrium in the two-player repeated Stack-

The following theorem states that once a Stackelberg equilibrium exists and

vi > v1−i, then this player Ni must buy all SN F T (id) at last.

Theorem 4. If vi > v1−i, i = 0, 1, and a Stackelberg equilibrium exists, then

Based on Theorem 4, we go to prove the existence of the Stackelberg equi-

librium by proposing an equilibrium strategy in the following theorem.

5 Multi-Player Repurchase Stackelberg Game

This section goes to extend the discussion for the multi-player scenario, in which
N0 has more than half of SN F T (id), and {N1, · · · , Nk} are repurchased par-
ticipants. N0 triggers the repurchase process, and asks all other repurchased
participants to report their bids pi at ﬁrst, and N0 decides his bid p0 later. We
also model the repurchase process of the multi-player scenario as a two-stage
Stackelberg game, where {N1, · · · , Nk} are the leaders to determine their bids
in Stage I, and N0 acts as the followers to decide his bid p0 in Stage II. Diﬀerent
from the two-player scenario, N0 shall trade with each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. Then
each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k, has his utility Ui(p0, pi) as (1) and (2). But the utility of
N0 is the total utility from the trading with all Ni. That is

U0(p0, p1, · · · , pk) =

k
(cid:88)

i=1

U i

where U i

0(p0, p1) is deﬁned as (1) and (2).

5.1 Analysis of Stackelberg Equilibrium

In the Stackelberg repurchase game for multi-player scenario, N0 shall trade with
each Ni, i = 1, · · · , k. Inspired by the Stackelberg equilibrium in the two-player
Stackelberg game, we ﬁrst discuss the best response of N0, if each Ni reports his
bid as

(cid:40)

p∗
i =

v0
v0 + 1

if vi ≤ v0;
if vi ≥ v0 + 1.

(12)

Then we study the collusion from a group of repurchased players. Our task is
to prove that once a group of repurchased participants deviate from the bidding
strategy (12), then their total utility must be decreased. This guarantees that
each participant would like to follow the bidding strategy (12).

Lemma 7. In the Stackelberg repurchase game for the multi-player scenario, if
all leaders set their bids {p∗
i } as (12) in Stage I, then the best response of the
0(p∗

To study the collusion of repurchased participants, we partition the set of
{N1, · · · , Nk} into two disjoint subsets A and B, such that each Ni ∈ A fol-
lows the bidding strategy (12), while each Ni ∈ B does not. Thus given all bids
provided by players, the bid proﬁle p = (p0, {p∗
i }Ni∈A, {pi}Ni∈B) can be equiv-
alently expressed as p = (p0, p∗
A, pB). Here we are interested in the total utility

In the case of incomplete information, the analysis of the Bayesian Stackel-
berg equilibrium becomes extremely complicated. As discussed in Section 3.2, in
the case of the two-player Stackelberg game, the leader only needs to optimize
the utility based on incomplete information. However, when there are multiple
leaders, the strategies of leaders should reach a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which
is much more diﬃcult to calculate. So we regard it as our future work to analyze
the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium of the multi-player repurchase Stackelberg
game.

6 Discussion

6.1 A Blockchain Solution to Budget Constraints

In the previous settings, we do not consider the budget constraints. However,
this is a common problem for many newly proposed mechanisms. Therefore, we
propose a solution scheme by blockchain for the setting with budget constraints.
Suppose N0 owes more than half of SN F T (id) and triggers the repurchase
process. Our mechanism consists of two stages. All participants except for N0
report their bids in Stage I, and N0 gives his bid p0 in Stage II. We assume N0’s
budget is larger than (M −m0)p0, so that he can repurchase all other shares at his
bid p0. For Ni, i (cid:54)= 0, if pi > p0, Ni should pay p0+pi
2 mi. However, the payment
of p0+pi
2 mi may exceed his budget, such that Ni has not enough money to buy
mi units of SN F T (id). Under this situation, we provide a blockchain solution
for Ni to solve the problem of budget shortage. That is, we allow Ni to sell his
option of buying mi units of SN F T (id) to anyone in the blockchain system. If
nobody would like to buy Ni’s repurchase option, then N0 can repurchase Ni’s
shares at a lower price. Therefore, after reporting bids, additional four steps are
needed to ﬁnish the payment procedure.
– Step 1. N0 pays (cid:80)

– Step 2. For all i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , k} that pi > p0, Ni shall pay p0+pi

(cid:80)
{1, 2, · · · , k}, he gets the revenue of p0+pi

2 mi. After the payment, N0 gets
mi pieces of SN F T (id). For each Ni with pi ≤ p0, i ∈
·mi and loses mi units of SN F T (id).
· mi to buy
mi units of SN F T (id) from N0. Once mi units of SN F T (id) of N0 is sold
to Ni, N0 obtains a discounted revenue p0+pi−1
If Ni would not like to repurchase SN F T (id), then he can sell his repurchase
option to others at a price of (cid:101)pi ∈ Z. The price of repurchase option (cid:101)pi could
be negative, meaning that Ni shall pay (cid:101)pi to another who accepts his chance.
If Ni does nothing, we regard that Ni proposes (cid:101)pi = 0.

i∈{1,2,··· ,k},pi≤p0

i∈{1,2,··· ,k},pi≤p0

– Step 3. If a participant in the blockchain system accepts the price of (cid:101)pi, then
he would propose a transaction to buy mi units of SN F T (id) from N0. The
total cost of this participant is (cid:101)pi + p0+pi
· mi, in which (cid:101)pi is paid to Ni and
N0 obtains a discounted revenue of p0+pi−1
· mi. And mi units of SN F T (id)
are transferred from N0 to the participant who buys the repurchase option.
At the end of this step, let C be the participant set, in which each partici-
pant’s repurchase option hasn’t been sold yet.

– Step 4. For each participant Ni ∈ C, N0 repurchases mi units of SN F T (id)
from Ni at a lower price of 2p0 −pi(< p0). At the end of this step, N0 obtains
mi units of SN F T (id), and Ni obtains a revenue of (2p0 − pi) · mi.

6.2 A Blockchain Solution to Lazy Bidders

Under some circumstances, an SN F T (id) holder might not bid in the repur-
chase process, who is named as a lazy bidder. This lazy behavior may block the
repurchase process. To solve the problem caused by lazy bidders, we propose the
following two schemes.

ABSNFT

17

– Custody Bidding. NFT’s smart contract supports the feature for the
SN F T (id) holders to assign administrators to report a bid when the holder
is idle or fails to make a bid.

– Value Predetermination. Whenever a participant obtains any units of
SN F T (id), this participant is required to predetermine the value at which
he is willing to bid, and this information is stored in the smart contract. At
the beginning of the repurchase process, if a participant fails to make a bid
within a certain amount of time, the smart contract automatically reports
this participant’s predetermined bid. This does not mean, however, that the
participant has to bid at the predetermined price if he decides to make an
active bid.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a novel securitization and repurchase scheme for NFT
to overcome the restrictions in existing NFT markets. We model the NFT repur-
chase process as a Stackelberg game and analyze the Stackelberg equilibria under
several scenarios. To be speciﬁc, in the setting of the two-player one-round game,
we prove that in a Stackelberg equilibrium, N0, the participant who triggers the
repurchase process, shall give the bid equally to his own value estimate. In the
two-player repeated game, all securities shall be ﬁnally owned by the participant
who has a higher value estimate. In the setting of multiple players, cooperation
among participants cannot bring higher utilities to them. What’s more, each
participant can get non-negative utility if he bids truthfully in our repurchase
process.

How to securitize and repurchase NFT eﬃciently is a popular topic in the
ﬁeld of blockchain. Our work proposes a sound solution for this problem. In the
future, we continue to reﬁne our theoretical analysis. First, for the multi-player
repurchase Stackelberg game, we will consider the case with incomplete infor-
mation and explore the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium. Second, a model of
blockchain economics will be constructed to analyze the payment procedure in
Section 6.1. Furthermore, there exist some other interesting problems, including
how to securitize and repurchase a common-valued NFT [12], how to host Com-
plete NFTs or Securitized NFTs in decentralized custody protocols [6], whether
ABSNFT can serve as a price Oracle, and so on.

Appendix

A. Proof of Theorem 2

Proof. From Theorem 1 we know that the best response of N0 is always p∗
0 = v0.
Next, we shall discuss the best response of N1 under the condition that N0’s
bidding strategy is p0 = v0. By (4), we have

U1(v0, p1) =

(cid:40)

m1( v0+p1
2 − v1)
m1(v1 − v0+p1
)

2

if p1 ≤ v0;
if p1 ≥ v0 + 1.

So U1 monotonically increases when p1 ≤ v0 and monotonically decreases when
p1 ≥ v0 + 1, implying p∗

1 ∈ {v0, v0 + 1}. Particularly, when v0 ≥ v1, we have

U1(v0, v0) = m1(v0 − v1) ≥ 0 > m1(v1 − v0 −

) = U1(v0, v0 + 1),

showing the best response of N1 is p∗

1 = v0. On the other hand, when v0 ≤ v1 −1,

U1(v0, v0) = m1(v0 − v1) < 0 < m1(v1 − v0 −

1
2

) = U1(v0, v0 + 1),

showing the best response of N1 is p∗

1 = v0 + 1. This result holds.

If pd

C. Proof of Lemma 8

Proof. By Lemma 2, if follower N0 sets its price as p0 = v0 in Stage II, then the
optimal price is pi = p∗
i by leader Ni is Stage I. It means that 0 ≤ Ui(v0, pi) <
Ui(v0, p∗

i ), implying

Let us simplify the best response BR(p1, · · · , pk) of N0 as BR. From Lemma 1
we have
