Abstract 
Healthcare systems are increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence into their systems, but it is not a solution 
for all difficulties. AI's extraordinary potential is being held back by challenges such as a lack of medical datasets 
for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a lack of trust  due to its black box working style. We explored 
how blockchain technology can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This paper has 
conducted a Systematic Literature Review to explore the state-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare 
applications developed with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This systematic literature review 
proceeds  with  three  different  paths as  natural  language  processing-based  healthcare  systems,  computer  vision-
based  healthcare  systems and  acoustic  AI-based  healthcare systems.  We  found  that  1)  Defence  techniques  for 
adversarial  attacks  on  AI  are  available  for  specific  kind  of  attacks  and  even  adversarial  training  is  AI  based 
technique which in further prone to  different attacks. 2) Blockchain can address security and privacy issues in 
healthcare  fraternity.  3)  Medical  data  verification  and  user  provenance  can  be  enabled  with  Blockchain.  4) 
Blockchain  can  protect  distributed  learning  on  heterogeneous  medical  data.  5)  The  issues  like  single  point  of 
failure,  non-transparency  in  healthcare  systems  can  be  resolved  with  Blockchain.  Nevertheless,  it  has  been 
identified  that  research  is  at  the  initial  stage.  As  a  result,  we  have  synthesized  a  conceptual  framework  using 
Blockchain Technology for  AI-based healthcare  applications  that  considers the  needs  of each  NLP, Computer 
Vision, and Acoustic AI application. A global solution for all sort of adversarial attacks on AI based healthcare. 
However, this technique has significant limits and challenges that need to be addressed in future studies.

Introduction 

From infectious diseases, cancer to radiology, the healthcare sector is in a desperate need of transformation. There 
are almost countless ways towards using technologies to provide more accurate, reliable, and effective treatments. 
These treatments  can  be precise at the  right time in  a clinical  decision.  Artificial  intelligence  uses a  computer 
program with precise commands to execute functions that usually require a human intelligence. Algorithms are 
coded programming rules. Machine learning is a method of constantly improving an algorithm. The improvement 
process utilizes vast volumes of data and is performed dynamically, enabling the algorithm to adjust to improve 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  accuracy  of  said  artificial  intelligence.  AI  can  understand  and  interpret  language,  identify  objects,  detect 
sounds, and learn patterns to execute problem-solving operations.  

In this review, as shown in Figure 1 we provide insight into three perspectives of Artificial Intelligence 
and their specific challenges in healthcare: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Acoustic 
AI. Natural language processing's primary objective is for computers to comprehend texts and languages the same 
way as humans do. Computer systems will interpret, deduce, summarize, translate, and synthesize exact text and 
language once accomplished.  As mentioned in Figure 1’s text section, in healthcare systems, a vast amount of 
textual data is generated in the form of clinical reports, lab reports, handwritten notes, and other documents like 
admission, and discharge notes, and many more. To handle this enormous data and analyze it manually would be 
overweighing tasks for clinical experts. The primary tasks that can be driven through NLP are extracting important 
facts from text, classification of information, and opinion mining. NLP helps by analyzing these growing data and 
convert  them  to  a  manageable  computer  format.  It  can  also  help  to  assist  clinical  decisions,  identify  critical 
patients, and classify diseases and disorders.  

Nowadays, computer vision is also being used in the healthcare industry. The rapidly growing area of 
computer vision is concerned with training computers to mimic human vision and understand the items in front 
of  them.  Computer  vision  does  this  by  leveraging  artificial  intelligence  algorithms  which  analyze  images.  As 
shown in Figure 1’s image section, X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound images and videos proved to be the most vital 
elements in a patient’s diagnosis. Through different tasks like object detection, classification, localization, and 
analysis from images or videos, computer vision can promote remote patient monitoring, automated diagnosis, 
and  automated  lab  reports.  It  can  promote  the  emergence  of  numerous  applications  that  can  be  lifesaving  for 
patients in Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Dermatology, and Fundoscopy.  

Along  with  text  and  images  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1’s  audio  section,  certain  sounds  like  coughing, 
breathing,  heartbeats,  crying,  etc.,  play  a  major  role  in  diagnosing  respiratory  diseases,  pulmonary  diseases, 
cardiac diseases, and pain in neonates. AI assists in automating these diagnoses by detecting sounds, performing 
classification, and analyzing them through the audio spectrum. Various state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms 
are available for audio signal processing, which can be helpful in the healthcare industry. It assists in automatic 
diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, diagnosis of cardiac diseases, measuring pain in neonates and 
detecting depression in human beings. 

There  are certain  common general  challenges  faced  by  AI models as mentioned  in  Figure  1  for  their 
wider adoption in the healthcare industry. First, AI models can work precisely when trained on sufficiently large 
datasets. Hence the availability of vast, accurate, and trusted datasets for training is one of the major challenges. 
Second, it can be possible if we decide to aggregate data from different resources. As organizations continue to 
collect, store, and transport individuals' health sensitive data, it should be protected from privacy violation and 
security breaches. Third, AI models are black box in nature; hence, it is difficult to identify biased models. There 
must be the provenance of prediction or classification resulting in specific healthcare input to overcome lack of 
trust on learned model. Human lives are at stake if the wrong treatment is followed based on the AI results. Fourth, 
to overcome the threat of rogue devices, there should be secure resource sharing. Fifth, knowledge sharing among 
researchers  and  clinical  expertise  has  information  privacy  issues.  Hence,  there  must  be  a  proven  strategy  to 
overcome these challenges to see the healthcare industry dominated by AI in the coming years.

Background/Rationale 

Blockchain  technology  can  address  the  challenges  faced  by  AI  as  mentioned  in  Figure  1  in  several  ways.  A 
blockchain  is  a  distributed ledger  with  transactions that are  replicated throughout  the  blockchain’s ecosystem. 
Security and privacy feature of blockchain are enriched with the cryptographic linkage of information in chronicle 
order, consensus protocol  within  the  network, and  smart contracts.  Moreover, it  builds  strong  trust  among  the 
users. Hence it can also establish trust, organize data, allow sharing resources in AI-based healthcare. This study 
mainly targets the applicability of  blockchain in AI-based healthcare systems considering security and privacy 
issues in three vertical aspects of it as natural language processing, computer vision and acoustic AI. 

Blockchain technology is featured with distributed ledger in the peer-to-peer network. Distributed ledger 
maintains  transactional  records  securely.  This  feature  promotes  the  secure  distributed  learning  or  federated 
learning on heterogeneous data by recording local gradients on blockchain. Moreover, a smart contract automates 
the  transaction  execution  in  the  distributed  network  without  any  third-party  or  centralized  authority.  Smart 
contract is an executable code available at every node which gets triggered on transaction initialization. Smart 
contracts validate the transaction. Through smart contracts access control rules can be imposed for data access. 
User  provenance  is  possible  with  smart  contract.  For  transactional  data,  a  block  is  generated.  Miners  are 
responsible for committing the block in the blockchain using a consensus algorithm. Consensus algorithms mine 
the block. It makes miners solve difficult cryptographic puzzles and share their results with a group of miners. 
The miner who first solves the puzzle gets a chance to mine a block of the transactions into the existing chain of 
blocks and replicate the new chain at every node. For collective decision making on diagnosis and treatment in 
AI-based healthcare systems consensus algorithms can be the proven technique. Blocks are linked with each other 
cryptographically, which makes them immutable and auditable. The same copy of the ledger is replicated at all 
nodes  in the  network,  henceforth achieving  the  highest  degree  of availability  and  transparency.  Cryptographic 
linkage can  validate  the medical  data  and  support  tamperproof copy  of  it. There are three types  of  blockchain 
available as public blockchain, private blockchain, and consortium blockchain. In public blockchain, anyone can 
enter the network and participate in the transaction process. In contrast, private blockchain restricts entry without 
proper  authentication  and  verification.  Consortium  blockchain  combines  the  features  of  public  and  private 
blockchain. Figure 2 depicts the flow of activities in the blockchain network.

Significance of Study: 

In AI-based health care, data-driven learning and exploration will improve awareness and productivity in terms 
of precise diagnosis and treatment ahead. While giving rise to certain challenges like anonymity, data control, and 
the revenue generation from patient’s sensitive information. It would be critical to establish a strong trust in the 
data used to boost machine learning tools. To ensure that the resulting treatment quality is high and that patients 
receive  the  assistance  they  need  to  treat  chronic  diseases  or  acute  illnesses  in  a  timely  manner.  Artificial 
intelligence  and  machine  learning  in  medicine  have  enormous  potential  to  improve  healthcare,  but  different 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adversarial attacks on NLP, computer vision, and acoustic AI are possible which limit their real time adoption. 
These attacks cannot be tolerated in sensitive application areas like in healthcare.  

Blockchain  will  protect  against  adversarial  attacks  considering  the  security requirements  of  NLP, 
computer  vision,  and  acoustic  AI,  respectively.  When  it  comes  to  security  and  privacy,  the  convergence  of 
blockchain  and  AI-based  healthcare  has  the  potential  to  be  transformative.  This  study  uncovers  existing 
blockchain integrated AI-based healthcare applications. This study maps the blockchain solution to the adversarial 
attacks in NLP, computer vision, and acoustic AI to bring robustness to AI-based healthcare systems. A conceptual 
framework  is  synthesized  for  the  same.  This  contribution  will  help  to  further  academic  knowledge  in  the 
blockchain for AI envisioned healthcare applications. 

Terms and Terminology: 

•  Blockchain: A blockchain is a growing collection of data known as blocks that are connected via encryption. 
Blockchains  are  generally  administered  via  a  peer-to-peer  network  for  a  publicly  distributed  ledger,  with 
nodes communicating and validating new blocks using a protocol. 

•  Encryption: Encryption is the process of translating data or information into the code, particularly to restrict 

data leakage. 

•  Nodes: The computers in a blockchain network are known as blockchain nodes, and they are responsible to 
maintain a replica of the distributed ledger and operating as communication channels for different network 
activities. 

•  Block: Blocks are used to store batches of valid transactions that have been hashed. Each block contains the 
cryptographic hash of the previous block on the blockchain. Next, a chain is formed by the connected blocks. 
This recursive procedure validates the preceding block's integrity to the first block, the genesis block. 
•  Transaction: An exchange or transfer of assets that occurs within two or more individuals and generates a 

contractual relationship is referred to as a transaction. 

•  Cryptographic  hash:  Cryptographic  hash  is  fixed  size  of  value  generated  from  arbitrary  size  of  data  by 

applying cryptographic functions. 

•  Genesis block: The Genesis Block can be called as Block 0 as it is the very first block in a blockchain, on 

which the subsequent blocks are built. 

•  Smart  Contract:  A  smart  contract  is  a  computer  program, or  a  transaction  protocol  designed  to  execute, 
control, or document contractually important events and acts under the conditions of a contractual agreement. 
•  Consensus  Algorithm:  A  consensus  algorithm  is  a  computer  program that  allows  distributed  processes  or 

systems to agree on a single data value. 

•  Natural  Language  Processing:  Natural  language  processing  (NLP)  is  a  field  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI) 
focused on providing computers with the potential to interpret text and spoken languages in much the same 
way as humans can. 

•  Computer Vision: Computer vision is an artificial intelligence area that teaches computers to interpret and 
comprehend  the  visual  environment.  Machines  can  effectively  detect  and  categorize  items  using  digital 
pictures from cameras and movies and deep learning models — and then respond to what computers perceive. 
•  Acoustic AI: Acoustic AI uses artificial intelligence to build sophisticated audio signal processing algorithms 

that understand sounds in the environment on an immense scale. 

•  Adversarial  Attack:  An  adversarial  attack  is  a  strategy  for  locating  a  perturbation  that  alters  a  machine 

learning model's prediction. The disturbance may be extremely tiny and invisible to human sight. 

•  Federated Learning: Federated learning is a machine learning approach in which an algorithm is trained across 

several decentralized edge devices or servers, keeping local data samples without being exchanged. 

•  Explainable AI: Explainable AI is a collection of tools and frameworks designed to assist in understanding 

and interpreting predictions generated by machine learning models. 

Evolution of Blockchain in Healthcare 4.0 and Start of Healthcare 5.0:  
Healthcare 4.0 has underlined global healthcare with real-time monitoring and involves AI and data analytics. In 
2016, blockchain was suggested first time in the healthcare system to liberate inefficient assets, address critical 
organizational  issues,  and  manage  electronic  transfers  and  the  exchange  of  healthcare  records.  Drug 
manufacturing  systems  can  also  be  monitored[1].  MedRec framework  based  on  blockchain  technologies  was 
proposed to manage EMRs (Electronic Medical Records)[2]. Blockchain provided trusted data marketplaces [3]. 
Later  considering  the  privacy  issues  in  public  networks,  the  privacy-preserved  healthcare  data  management 
system MediBchain was proposed [4]. From 2018, the new approach of integrating Blockchain with AI and IoT 
(Internet  of  Things)  brought  a  revolutionary  change  in  healthcare  system.  This  integration  has  offered  more 
efficient  EHR  (Electronic  Health  Record)  management,  remote  patient  monitoring,  autonomous  diagnosis, 
distributed parallel computing for precise medicine  [5]–[9]. In 2019, A prototype of a telemedicine framework 
using blockchain was developed for securing the remote delivery of healthcare services to rural and remote area 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in  Bangladesh and  protecting  patient’s  health  related  sensitive  data[10].  A revolutionary  blockchain-based fog 
monitoring framework was proposed in 2019 for human activity identification. It is an extension to e-Healthcare 
facilities, based on creating clustered based feature vectors. Remote patient monitoring system is featured with 
big data analytics [11], [12]. Later in 2020, the convergence of blockchain has extended to  federated learning, 
explainable  AI,  5G  and  6G  network  [13],  [14].  Protection  and  privacy  are  important  during  the  collection, 
management,  and  distribution  of  EHR  data  [15].  Synthesis  of  AI  and  blockchain provide  a  blueprint  for  a 
blockchain-assisted  open  bionetwork  of  private  healthcare  records  to  accelerate  emerging  methodologies  for 
medication development and preventative healthcare [16]. The start of the Healthcare 5.0 era has been announced 
with  the  Intelligent  Telesurgery  technology  with  6G-enabled  Tactile  Internet  (TI)  built  on  the  blockchain  to 
provide  real-time  and  intelligent  ultra-responsive  healthcare  facilities  virtually  with  high  effectiveness  and 
productivity [17]. In early 2021, research in secured image processing and sharing is uplifted with blockchain[18]. 
For the  IoMT  (Internet  of  Medical  Things)  environment,  deep  learning  (DL)  with  blockchain-assisted  secured 
image transmission and diagnostic model is invented [19]. Again, to provide adequate protection against all cyber-
attacks in the healthcare industry, the Hyperledger Fabric technology has proved effective [20]. Figure 3 highlights 
the milestones in Healthcare 4.0 and the start of Healthcare 5.0 with blockchain technology.

Prior Research 

There are some relevant literature reviews in the Blockchain and Healthcare space. The review [21] looked at the 
handling  of  patient  data  and  identity.  The  focus  was  on  Electronic  Health  Records  (EHR)  and  Patient  Health 
Records (PHR) and how blockchain grants patients’ power for their data and self-sovereign identity. The study 
[22]  highlighted  the blockchain-enabled  healthcare  applications.  In  that  review,  blockchain  adaptability  in 
healthcare was also investigated and validated. The study [23] focus on Smart contracts for EHR access control 
in healthcare considering permissioned and permissionless Blockchain. The reviews  [24]–[26] have investigated 
various  blockchain  implementations  in  the  healthcare  domain  and  proposed  potential  research  directions  and 
trends in healthcare as precise diagnosis, cybercrime protection and enhance patient care in case of emergencies 
and remote patient monitoring.  Using blockchain technologies in the healthcare sector could enhance information 
security by allowing healthcare data to be processed and shared while maintaining data privacy and security was 
concluded by the study [27]. After a thorough examination of the existing major issues in the healthcare field, 
[28]  this  review  examined the  capacity  of  blockchain technologies  to  improve the  protection,  anonymity, and 
interoperability of healthcare data. This study suggested few innovative blockchain applications in the health care 
sector,  such  as  blockchain  collaboration,  smart  contract-based  health  care  intelligent  claim  processing, 
authorization, and wearable fitness device integration and health tracking. The studies [29], [30] identified the 
effectiveness  of  blockchain  for healthcare  and  opportunities and  challenges,  emphasizing  Telemedicine, 
Telehealth, and E-Health. The scope of the review [31] is restricted to information on blockchain for clinical trials 
and challenges. [32] Focused on blockchain applications exclusively for EHR. Table 1 depicts the comparison of 
existing reviews on blockchain in healthcare.

We note few shortcomings in the previous studies, which can be summarized as follows: 

•  Previous  studies  mainly  focused  on  EHR  and  some  specific  specialized  healthcare  services,  e.g., 

Telemedicine.  

•  Existing literature is not concentrated on blockchain for AI-enabled healthcare. Henceforth, it does not 
go into depth about blockchain to mitigate adversarial attacks or cyber threats in AI-enabled healthcare.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Furthermore,  none  of  the  surveys  mentioned  using  blockchain  technology  to  incorporate  robustness 
in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI domains for automated and precise 
healthcare services.  
It is not the first review in blockchain for healthcare, but it is significantly distinct from existing surveys. 
Our  SLR  is  comprehensive  in  highlighting  innovation,  strategies,  and  threats  related  to  state-of-the-art 
blockchain-envisioned artificial  intelligent  healthcare  applications  targeting  Natural  Language  Processing, 
Computer  Vision,  and  Acoustic  AI  domains  by  considering  the potential  of  AI  in  healthcare  along  with 
the adversarial  attacks  they  may  face.  In  addition,  our  SLR  emphasizes  the  research  gaps  to  highlight 
prospective research pathways. 

Motivation: 

Human intelligence and their physical abilities are restricted with certain boundaries, which leads to automation 
in  healthcare.  The  Healthcare  sector  is  receiving  overwhelming  breakthroughs  in  digital  transformation  with 
artificial intelligence. Researchers are coming up with innovative  AI solutions in healthcare system to provide 
better clinical diagnosis and treatment. As shown in Figure 4, over the last five years, research articles in AI-based 
healthcare are rapidly increasing in the Scopus database (Limited to English articles only). In 2021, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) has issued ethics and governance standards for implementing artificial intelligence 
in healthcare [135]. This initiative aims to confirm that these innovations are in line with the objectives of fostering 
inclusive  and  fair  global  health,  adhering  to  health  and  safety  standards,  and  assisting  to  achieve  sustainable 
development  in  Healthcare.  The  overall  investment  towards  healthcare  AI  by the  public  and  private  sectors is 
astounding. Accenture estimates that by 2026, the edge AI applications will save $150 billion annually [136]. 

Figure 4. Year-wise publication trend for AI in Healthcare (2016-2021) Source: www.scopus.com (Accessed 15/11/2021). 

However, it is unclear how often patients will trust AI resources and be inclined to obey an AI diagnosis 
or adopt the treatment by AI. Users must trust that the algorithm is based on sound clinical guidelines. The data 
that strengthens these tools is precise, relevant, transparent, and reliable for AI to survive in healthcare. Although 
artificial intelligence tools are inherently complex, healthcare developers must provide trust and transparency to 
the fullest in diagnosis and treatment. This study targets blockchain technology as a solution to the shortcomings 
mentioned earlier. In a pandemic, a large medical workforce is required; however, Intelligent AI-based healthcare 
automation will alleviate the strain on the healthcare workforce. The adoption of AI-based healthcare may indeed 
be aided by blockchain technology. However, the work done in blockchain to improve healthcare AI processes is 
not  comprehensive.  This  study  details  the  advances  in  AI-based  healthcare  made  possible  by  blockchain 
technology and potential directions that will encourage researchers to investigate blockchain technology for AI-
based healthcare systems with a new perspective of breaking down the domain into three as NLP, computer vision 
and acoustic AI. 

Research Goal: 

This  study  highlights  privacy  and  security  aspects  of  artificial  intelligence-based  healthcare  systems  and  risk 
mitigation with blockchain technology. For this study, healthcare applications from three domains like NLP-based

Contribution of the Work: 

In  this  work,  we  concentrated  on  NLP,  computer  vision,  and  acoustic  AI-based  healthcare.  We  have 
listed various healthcare applications in an individual domain like NLP-based Healthcare, computer vision-based 
healthcare, acoustic AI-based healthcare, and their challenges. We have touched on adversarial attacks on NLP, 
computer vision,  and acoustic  AI,  which threaten the  use  of  AI in  healthcare. To address  security and  privacy 
concerns  in  AI, authors  have  reviewed existing  blockchain research  for  AI-based  healthcare.  Furthermore,  we

Literature Review 

Blockchain for AI-based Healthcare 

In  analysis  of  images,  deep  models  have  been  extensively  utilized  to  tackle  several  difficulties  in  medical 
treatments.  When deep learning is trained on a massive quantity of data, it may work more efficiently. Hospitals, 
diagnostic laboratories, research institutions, and patients may exchange valuable findings and work together to 
improve the AI model.  However, they face challenges in sharing important data with third parties due to privacy 
and  security  concerns.  Hence,  secure  data  sharing  becomes  an  obstacle  in  improving  the  quality  of  AI-based 
healthcare  systems.  Kumar  et  al.  [33]  have  proposed  a  strategy  that involves  sharing  local  models  via  the 
blockchain  network,  leveraged  to  collectively  develop  a global model  for  improved  prediction  of  lung  cancer 
using  CT  scan  images.  As  a  result,  the  collectively  updated  model  aids  in  accurately  identifying  the  patients' 
disease,  resulting  in  improved  therapy.  This  will  avoid  actual  sharing  of  data  and  hence  maintains  privacy. 
Through smart contracts, organizations will upload their data over IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and share 
local gradients. Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm is used to train the global model. The trust in data 
is built over a smart contract, and the hash of the local gradient is maintained in the blockchain. Kim et al. [34] 
have presented a blockchain algorithm that checks the data that has been refined. The agreement algorithm on the 
blockchain  is  HyperPOR.  The  HyperPOR  algorithm  functions  by  confirming  the  business  partner's  identity. 
Then the  generation  block  validates  and  accomplishes  distributed  computing,  adds  sharding  technology  for 
protecting PHR(Patient Health Records). Nguyen et al. [35] have proposed an intrusion detection system to protect 
data transmission in the cyber-physical system of healthcare. 

Most of the time, patients have little control over who has access to their medical records and are ignorant 
of the full worth of the information they possess. Mamoshina et al. [7] have presented AI and Blockchain solutions 
to speed up biomedical research. Moreover, provide patients with new technologies for controlling and profiting 
with  their  personal  information  and  incentives  to  undertake  periodic  health checkups.  They  have  proposed 
Exonum as a permissioned Blockchain framework, wherein patients can sell their health records using tokens. 
However, this framework does not have control over data once it has been sold to regulators. Jennath et al. [36] 
proposed  a  trustworthy  Artificial  Intelligence  model  over  Blockchain  for  e-health.  An  immutable  distributed 

 
 
 
 
 
 
ledger is used to record the provenance of individual permission and the authenticity of data sources to create and 
train the AI model. 

Rahman et al. [37] have used blockchain and off-chain to safeguard from manipulation and illegal access, 
bringing confidence to the provenance of a dataset and distributed models to protect the privacy and security of 
the  Internet  of  Health Things (IoHT)  data.  The  insecure  central  gradient aggregator  is  replaced  with a  secure, 
tamper-proof gradient mining and distributed consensus-based aggregator in the blockchain. The edge training, 
trust management, and authentication of participating federated nodes, the dissemination of globally or locally 
trained models, and the identity of edge nodes and their contributed datasets or models are managed by smart 
contracts. This system provides the complete encryption of both a dataset and  a trained model. Puri et al. [38] 
implemented  a  decentralized  healthcare  framework  powered  by  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  that  accesses  and 
authenticates Internet of Things (IoT) devices while also instilling confidence and transparency in patient’s health 
records (PHR). The technique is based on AI-enabled smart contracts and the development of a public blockchain 
network. In addition, the framework detects potentially dangerous IoT nodes in the network. Gupta et al. [39] 
offer BITS, a unique intelligent TS system based on blockchain. They provide thorough insights into the cloud-
based  and  blockchain-based  smart  TS  frameworks,  emphasizing  the  challenges  of  security,  dependability, 
confidentiality, and  data  management.  In  the case  of  federated  learning, if  rogue  devices  start communicating 
erroneous local model updates, the global model's accuracy will be skewed. Here blockchain can assure that the 
local updates in federated learning come from trusted devices. Also, local updates available in blockchain help 
further verify the accuracy of the learned model. Polap et al. [40] have presented a federated learning methodology 
that  combines  decentralized  learning  with  blockchain-based  security  and  a  solution  for  developing  intelligent 
systems with decentralized and locally stored data for the security and privacy of the Internet of Medical Things. 
This  solution  can  mitigate  the  model  poisoning  attacks.  Also,  [41]stated  a  way  for  training  a  global  model 
cooperatively utilizing blockchain technology and federated learning while maintaining anonymity in detecting 
covid-19 patients using CT images. 

Technological advances, such as distributed learning, provide a road ahead, but they are plagued by a 
lack of openness, reducing trust in the data utilized for analysis. To solve these challenges, Zerka et al.[42] has 
projected  that  Chained  Distributed  Machine  Learning  C-DistriM,  a  novel  distributed  learning  that  blends 
sequential  distributed  learning  with  a  blockchain-based  framework,  would  be  developed  in  medical  imaging. 
Blockchain  is  used  to  record  the  immutable  history  of  computation  and  protect  from  model  poisoning.  After 
training, it encrypted the local models and uploaded them on the cloud simultaneously, removing all local copies 
of the model. Access to the cloud is then restricted through the smart contract for unauthorized users. Kuo et al. 
[43] have proposed the ExplorerChain framework, which combines two important technologies, online machine 
learning  and  a  blockchain  without  a  centralized  authority,  to  learn  a  predictive  model  across  institutions  in  a 
distributed architecture, i.e., without the need for patient-level data sharing or a central coordinating node. 

Many  published  deep  learning  systems  lack  clarity  about  model  validation  and  testing  outcomes. 
Blockchain technology might be a viable answer to these challenges, operating as a decentralized, secure, and 
trustworthy  shared  ledger  for  data  management  and  offering  tracking  and  accountability  for  testing  results 
reporting. Schmetterer et al. [44] deployed a blockchain-based AI platform to establish data transmission, model 
transfer, and model testing in the real world across three sites in Singapore and China as a proof of concept. Using 
retinal images taken from distinct multiethnic populations from different countries, researchers set out to create 
and test deep learning algorithms to identify myopic macular degeneration and extreme myopia. They leveraged a 
blockchain-enabled AI infrastructure that helps secure, persistent, and verifiable data transmission, model transfer, 
and transparency in the diagnostic performance of deep learning algorithms. However, it does not maintain the 
privacy of data.  

Khan et  al.  [45]  explored a  wireless capsule  endoscopy  frame-based  automated  method  for  detecting 
stomach infections. A blockchain-based technique is used in a convolutional neural network model to secure the 
network  for  precise  identification  of  stomach  ailments  such  as  ulcers  and  bleeding.  Each  layer  comprises  an 
additional block that keeps certain information to resist any tempering and modification attacks. Pilozzi et al. [46] 
states that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly natural language processing (NLP), have shown to 
be  an  effective  tool  for  classifying  the  emotion  and  tonality  of  texts,  like  those  of  social  media  posts.  These 
approaches could be used to investigate the public perception of Alzheimer's disease. Incorporating secure and 
decentralized data transfer and storage methods like blockchain will give patients greater control over their data. 
It will help relieve most of the insecurities of unknowingly disclosing personal information to an entity that may 
discriminate against the patient.  

The following Figure 7 gives an overview of existing work done in blockchain for AI-based healthcare. 
It represents the type of blockchain used for the different modalities of data. There are three types of blockchain 
i.e.  Public,  Private,  and  Consortium  Blockchain.  Ethereum  is  mostly  preferred  for  public  blockchain  and 
hyperledger  fabric,  hyperledger  sawtooth  for  private  blockchain.  We  have  focused  on  text,  image,  and  audio 
modality of data in healthcare. It has been identified that no specific work done in blockchain for acoustic AI.

The Attack Surface of Artificial Intelligence 

Machine  learning  is  a  data  processing  technique  that  automates  the  development  of  analytical  models.  It  is  a 
subfield of artificial intelligence focused on the principle that computers can learn from data, recognize patterns, 
and  make  decisions  with  little  to  no  human  involvement.  These  tasks  required  obtaining  validated  data  using 
which classifiers are trained, and after successful training, the model is deployed. It might proceed with retraining 
and  feedback loops  for  performance  improvement.  Figure  8  puts the  light  on different  phases  involved  in  the 
successful deployment of the AI model. It starts with collecting data and prepare it for training by looking for bias 
or label it. Then, based on the requirement of application classifier is either developed or selected from the existing 
one.  A  classifier  is  trained  for the  acquired  dataset and  can  be  further improved by  adjusting parameters. The 
trained model is deployed at the end, which will proceed with retraining for future enhancement. 

Figure 8. Phases Involved in Deploying AI Model. 

An attack on a device or an information system is any action to reveal, change, disable, damage, capture, 
or  collect  information  by  exploiting  the  vulnerabilities  available  in  the  system.  Maintaining  the  privacy  of 
sensitive data or process, i.e., confidentiality, making data or process available without tampering, i.e., integrity 
and allowing data or process to be available to an intended user at any time, i.e., availability is the basic security 
requirement for any system. Henceforth this CIA triad applies to the phases mentioned above for deploying the 
ML model  securely.  In addition, three  vitals  need to  be protected  to  prevent the malfunctioning  of  the  trained 
model. Following Figure 9 focuses on the attack surface of artificial intelligence. Data, classifier/ algorithm, and 
learned model are the targeted areas for imposing attacks in AI-based systems by any adversary. 

 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Attack Surface of AI. 

Data 

The most critical component of artificial intelligence is data. Any model cannot be trained without data, and all 
current technological development will be for naught. There is a big investment of money only to collect as much 
specific  data  as  possible. Targeting  data  for  the attack  has a  drastic  impact  on  AI-based  systems.  Data  can  be 
compromised either at the training phase or testing phase by harnessing the extreme sensitivity of AI models to 
small changes in the input, which exploit abnormal behavior of the model, known as poisoning and evasion attack, 
respectively.  Spoofing  [47]  can  promote  these  attacks.  It  is  a  cyber-attack  wherein  an  adversary attempts  to 
mislead  other  computer  networks  by  impersonating  a  genuine  entity  using  a  computer,  device,  or  network. 
Malicious opponents frequently lack access to the training phase of the model. They create adversarial input to 
deceive a classifier or elude detection from a neural network during the testing phase. These can be either physical 
or digital kind of attacks. We are focusing on digital kinds of attacks for this study. A digital approach imparts 
tiny perturbation in the input directly. Here the attacker can exploit the targeted system without being detected by 
the intrusion detection system. Evasion attacks can also lead to concept drift [48]. Potential attackers can also gain 
access to the dataset used for training and contaminate the dataset with adversarial samples, known as poisoning 
attacks.  Adversarial  attacks  in  AI-based  healthcare  have  the  potential  to  harm  human  beings,  as  discussed  in 
further sections. 

Classifier/ Algorithm 
Trojan/Backdoor Attack 

1. 

A trojan attack compromises the genuine model by inserting a backdoor into the neural network, activated with a 
specific pattern in the testing sample. A trojan attack targets the origin of vulnerabilities in a neural network like 
data, algorithm, and program or hardware. It will modify the network with a compromised dataset [49]. At the 
time of the training phase, neural trojans are injected into the network  [50]. Trojan attacks are different that of 
adversarial attacks, although both take place at the training phase only. In the case of an adversarial attack, it does 
not force the neural network to modify itself; rather, it only affects the result. However, in a trojan attack, poisoned 
input samples make the network modify itself to work accurately for benign input samples, and it will malfunction 
only when triggered by a trojan. It is difficult for a user to identify the trojan attack [51]. A Stealthy Poisoning 
Attack (SPA) is depending on a Generalized Adversary Network (GAN), which can lead to a trojan attack  [52]. 
Badnet [53] is also an example of a neural trojan attack. The following Figure 10 depicts the scenario of a trojan 
attack. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Trojan Attack. 

Model 
Timing Side-Channel Attack 

1. 

The characteristics of neural networks for having different times for execution based on the depth of the network 
makes it vulnerable to attacks like timing side channel. By observing the time required for generating output by 
the  model,  an  adversary  can  conclude  with  the  number  of  layers,  i.e.,  the  depth  of  the  neural  network.  This 
adversary uses a regressor trained using different execution times along with the respective number of layers in 
the network. This information is then utilized to mimic substitute models with similar functionalities to the original 
network [54]. With the help of memory and timing side-channel attacks, information of the CNN model can be 
leaked using reverse engineering of structure and weights. The memory access patterns explode the vital features 
of a neural network like the total number of layers, size of the layer, and their dependencies [55]. 

  Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

NLP Techniques 
Named Entity Recognition 

1. 

The most fundamental method in NLP is retrieving entities from text. It emphasizes the key topics and connections 
in the text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) extracts entities from text such as persons, places, organizations, 
dates, etc. Grammar rules and supervised models are commonly used. 

2. 

Sentiment Analysis 

Sentiment analysis is the most used approach in NLP. Sentiment analysis is particularly effective when individuals 
express their thoughts and feedback, such as customer surveys, reviews, and social media comments. The most 
basic result of sentiment analysis is a three-point scale: positive/negative/neutral. The result can be a numerical 
score grouped into as many categories as the user desires in more sophisticated instances. 

3. 

Text Summarization 

This NLP method aids in the summarization of lengthy passages of text. Text summarization is commonly utilized 
in situations such as news articles and research papers. Extraction and abstraction are two major techniques  for 
text  summarization.  Extraction  methods  generate  a  summary  by  extracting  pieces  of  writing.  Abstraction 
approaches provide a summary by producing new text that expresses the essence of the original material. 

4. 

Aspect Mining 

Aspect mining identifies the various perspectives in a text. It retrieves entire information from the text that can be 
used in combination with sentiment analysis. Part-of-speech tagging is one of the simplest ways of aspect mining. 
When aspect mining and sentiment analysis are applied to a text, the outcome reveals the whole intention of the 
text. 

5. 

Topic Modeling 

One of the more difficult approaches for identifying natural concepts in the text is topic modeling. The fact that 
topic  modeling  is  an  unsupervised  approach  is  a  significant  benefit.  There  is  no  need  for  model  training  or  a 
labeled training dataset. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
NLP Applications in Healthcare 

There  are many  inputs  to Clinical  Decision  Support  Systems  (CDDS)  like  semi-structured data,  such as  XML 
documents  or  two-column  laboratory  results, structured  data such  as  Electronic  Health  Records  (EHR) 
and narrative text, patients' clinical findings, radiology records, and operative notes are examples of unstructured 
data. Several solutions have been proposed that use  NLP techniques with unstructured data as input to support 
clinical  decisions,  especially  to  compute  and  automate  diagnoses  or  treatments.  NLP  provides  adequate 
mechanisms for automated extraction of important facts from free text, which CDSS uses to generate the results 
and recommendations provided to healthcare professionals to assist them in making the best decisions [56]–[58]. 
The clinical notes, including the patients' health history, are crucial assets for resolving sensitive clinical problems 
difficult to access from other EHR components, like lab results. NLP makes it easy to retrieve meaningful features 
from clinical notes that can be used to build machine learning models. Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 
resources and clinical notes become effective and valuable tools with NLP for predicting mortality in diabetic 
patients in the critical care environment. However, we will need more research databases and patient cohorts to 
test  the  model  [59].  To  determine  sentiment  in  a  repository  of  narrative  hospital  admission  and  discharge 
statements, a sentiment scoring algorithm, also known as opinion mining, has been used [60]. Radiology reports 
are also in unstructured form. NLP makes it possible to identify and extract important features from those reports 
and  convert  them  into  manageable  computer  formats  [61].  Based  solely  on  the  content  of  clinical  notes,  the 
supervised machine learning-based NLP approach to identify the medical subdomain of a clinical note can assist 
clinicians in directing patients' unresolved problems to appropriate health professionals and experts promptly [62]. 
NLP  can  be  used  to  investigate  viral  transmission,  ocular  manifestation,  and  course  of  treatment  for 
ophthalmology patient care by analyzing COVID-19 ophthalmology-related articles [63]. NLP has the potential 
to revolutionize procedure-heavy sub-disciplines like gastroenterology by analyzing a tremendous amount of free-
text narrative medical reports [64]. To identify pediatric emergency department patients with a high suspicion of 
Kawasaki isease (KD), KD-NLP made significant improvements to clinician manual chart analysis [65]. Adverse 
drug  effects  (ADE)  and  medication-related  knowledge  can  be  extracted  using  a  well-designed  hybrid  NLP 
framework,  used  in  real-world  applications  to  facilitate  ADE-related  scientific  and  drug  decisions  [66].  The 
chatbot system will be fed with information about different diseases, and it will be able to understand the user 
question and respond appropriately using NLP [67]. There is evidence for wide acceptance of deep learning for 
clinical NLP due to the increasing volume of medical data [68]. NLP has been used in recent research to classify 
diseases and disorders that are hard to diagnose using only clinical gestalt. Information Retrieval (IR) takes less 
time and effort when NLP-based solutions are used, which ultimately foster the treatment [69], [70]. 

Adversarial Attacks on NLP and Defense 

Figure 11. Taxonomy of Adversarial Attack on Text. 

Adversarial text is a perturbation in the text regarding semantics, syntax, and visual similarity, which 
will mislead NLP. The Figure 11 depicts the methods for generating adversarial text. Adversarial examples in text 
can be a tiny attempt to modify minimum characters and create genuine typing errors comparable to those made 
by humans to affect the model’s prediction. This attack keeps the sequence of appearance of text very close to the 
original one. The attacks like DeepWordBug [71], hotflip [72], and textbugger [73] come under this approach of 
attack. Another approach to generating adversarial text depends on paraphrasing the original text. This attack will 
generate the semantical equivalence of the original text, but the model output will be different for the original and 
paraphrased text.  Alzantot [74], bae [75], Bert-attack [76], IGA [77], PWWS [78], textbugger [73], textfooler 
[79] are some attacks which generates adversarial text under mentioned approach. Textbugger is the combination 
of both approaches for targeting adversarial attacks on NLP.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Figure 12 illustrates the toxic effect of an adversarial attack on NLP-based Healthcare applications. 
Just replacing the words with their synonym while maintaining the semantic of the text can fool the  NLP. The 
wrong prediction of the severity of the disease ultimately leads to wrong treatment and puts lives at risk. Table 7 
gives overview of adversarial attacks on text.

The following Table 8 depicts the defense techniques for adversarial attacks on the NLP model, along 
with their limitations. It has been observed that adversarial training is the most robust defense technique for  a

  Computer Vision 

Computer Vision Techniques 
Image Classification 

1. 

A collection of images labeled with a specific category is available, and then to forecast these categories for a new 
set  of  test  images  and  assess  the  accuracy  of  those  predictions.  This  job  has  several  difficulties,  including 
perspective variation, size variation, intra-class variance, image distortion, image occlusion, lighting conditions, 
and backdrop clutter. 

2. 

Object Detection 

Defining objects inside pictures often entails producing bounding boxes and labels for each item. This procedure 
varies  from  the  classification/localization  job  in  that  classification  and  localization  are  applied  to  many  items 
rather than simply a single dominating object. There are only two types of object classification: object bounding 
boxes and non-object bounding boxes. 

3. 

Object Tracking 

The practice of following a particular object of interest, or several objects in each scene, is referred to as object 
tracking. Historically, it has been used in video and real-world interfaces where inspections are performed after 
an initial object identification. 

4. 

Semantic Segmentation 

The technique of segmentation, which splits whole pictures into pixel groupings that may subsequently be labeled 
and categorized, is essential to  computer vision. Semantic segmentation attempts to grasp the semantic role of 
each pixel in a picture. We must also define the bounds of each item. As a result, unlike categorization, we require 
detailed pixel-by-pixel predictions from our models. 

5. 

Instance Segmentation 

Instance segmentation goes beyond semantic segmentation by segmenting various instances of classes. There is 
usually  a picture  with  a  single item in  the center  in classification,  and  the  objective  is  to  identify  that  image. 
However,  to  segment  instances,  we  must  do  considerably  more  complicated  activities.  We  observe  complex 
scenes with many overlapping items and diverse backgrounds, and it not just classify these things but recognizes 
their borders, distinctions, and relationships to each other. 

Computer Vision Applications in Healthcare 

Intelligent intervention using a brain-like structure aids in the understanding and analysis of different forms of 
dynamic data by using cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and computer vision [80]. Computer vision 
is a scientific form of deep learning, where it detects objects from captured series of videos and images. Deep 
learning  algorithms  known  as  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  are  designed  to  process  image  data  and 
assign  importance  to  various  aspects  to  distinguish  one  image.  CNNs  have  a  structural  architecture  like  the 
connectivity  pattern of  neurons  in  the  brain.  In  object-classification  activities,  state-of-the-art computer  vision 
accuracy outperformed as compared to human accuracy. The National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening 
Trial (NLST) found that lung cancer screening with low dose computed tomography (CT) has reduced mortality 
by 20% [81]. The ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) brought together a large group 
of deep learning researchers who competed and collaborated to develop strategies for a variety of computer vision 
tasks  [82].  Computer  vision  has  a  longstanding  experience  of  allowing  computers  to  interpret  visual  imagery 
meaningfully. Identifying the type of an object in an image, the position of present objects, and both type and 
location  simultaneously  are  referred  to  as  object  classification,  localization,  and  detection,  respectively  [83]. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Advances  in  computer  vision  and  deep  learning  have  improved  the  effectiveness  of  smart  monitoring.  An 
innovative computer vision-aided deep learning derived posture monitoring system is introduced for predicting 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) oriented physical abnormalities in a person from their workplace [84]. At 
the same time, patient mobilization occurs early and often reduces the risk of post-intensive care syndrome and 
long-term  cognitive  dysfunction.  In  an  adult  ICU,  computer  vision  algorithms  identify  patient  mobilization 
activities like moving the patient into and out of bed and into and out of a chair [85]. Deep convolutional neural 
networks  provide  a  significant  opportunity  as  a  diagnostic  tool  for  otologic  prognosis  based  on  otoscopic  ear 
images [86]. Researchers combined computer vision approaches with deep learning neural network techniques to 
create  a  comprehensive  image  processing  model  to  predict  human  embryo  viability  [87].  Automated herbal 
medications based on tongue images are possible with deep learning to investigate the relevance of tongue with 
herbal medication [88]. Using a deep learning based automated platform to test Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from 
color fundus images may offer an alternative approach for reducing medication errors. A DL-based automated 
tool has significant advantages in cutting down screening rates, increasing healthcare coverage, and ensuring early 
treatment [89], [90]. The confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model, considered a feature extractor, an 
anomaly detection module, and a confidence predictor module for detecting viral pneumonia from chest X-rays, 
may be of considerable use for large-scale screening and infection control [91]. To detect hip fractures from pelvic 
x-ray  is  also  possible  with  a  computer vision  algorithm  [92].  The  revolutionary  CNN  method  for  detecting 
esophageal cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, will analyze recorded endoscopic 
images quickly and accurately [93]. The automatic identification of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) and its forms 
from non-contrast head CT scan scans is possible by deep learning algorithms [94]. A diagnosis from chest CT 
images is feasible, resulting in a deep learning algorithm in a fast and automated diagnostic method [95]. A novel 
visual SLAM algorithm can also track and locate robots in dynamic situations to reduce the chance of doctor-
patient cross-infection and prevents the growth of the COVID-19 [96]. 

Adversarial Attacks on Computer Vision and Defense 

Figure 13. Taxonomy for Adversarial Attack on Image. 

Adversarial  images  are  those  wherein  pixels  are  intentionally  perturbed  to  confound  and  fool  models; 
simultaneously, they seem innocuous and benign to human eyes. Adversarial images mislead DNN as a minute 
perturbation in the input makes DNN vulnerable. The Figure 13 represents the approaches for an adversarial attack 
on an image. Some approaches for attack depend on first order derivative by computing the derivative of the loss 
concerning input for targeting an increase in the loss, e.g., FGSM [97], BIM [98], R+FGSM [99]. Other attacks 
depend on an incremental optimization procedure on multiple goal objective functions, allowing an attacker to 
include additional hostile criteria into the targeted function, e.g., L-BFGS [100], C&W [101], ATN [102],  stAdv 
[103], Deepfool, Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP). An adversary may benefit from the transferability 
property of adversarial samples to attack a blackbox model by targeting a substitute model trained using a labeled 
dataset of the black-box model, e.g., substitute black box attack [104]. Another black-box approach is based on 
crawling closer to the decision boundary within adversarial input and non-adversarial input, e.g., boundary attack 
[105].  

Following Figure 14 reflects the adversarial effect of adding some perturbation in the original hand  x-
ray image. Perturb image is identical to the original image from human perception, but the AI model interprets 
the  wrong  result  after  processing.  For  example,  the  adversarial  attack  changes  the  prediction  from  a  hairline 
fracture to normal. Table 9 gives details of adversarial attacks on image.

The following Table 10 highlights the advantages and disadvantages of defense techniques designed to 
mitigate a different adversarial attack on computer vision models. It has been identified that the defense technique 
can  handle  only  a  particular  kind  of  attack  with  adversarial  training  and  other  techniques  also  have  certain 
limitations. Hence to frame a global solution to mitigate all kinds of adversarial attacks is a challenging task.

Selective Noise Cancelling

Artificial intelligence noise canceling technology improves headset microphones by removing background noise, 
resulting in crystal-clear online audio conversation. A processor with AI-enhanced profiles eliminates more than 
50 million different forms of background noise while maintaining speech harmonics. 

2. 

HI-Fi Audio Reconstruction 

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in utilizing deep neural networks to perform this up sampling on raw 
audio  waveforms.  To  train  neural  networks  to  infer  additional  time-domain  samples  from  an  audio  signal, 
equivalent to the picture super-resolution issue in which individual audio samples are analogous to pixels. It is 
possible to train a network to generate realistic audio by teaching how a normal recording sound. 

3. 

Analog Audio Emulation 

It involves calculating the complicated interactions of non-linear analog audio components. It investigates how a 
deep neural network (DNN) can learn the lengthy temporal dependencies that define these effect units with the 
possibility of matching nonlinearities within the audio effects using convolutional, recurrent, and fully connected 
layers.  It  investigates  linear  and  nonlinear  time-varying  emulation  as  a  content-based  transformation  without 
explicitly finding the time-variant solution. 

4. 

Speech Processing 

The computer receives input data of sound vibrations in speech recognition. This is accomplished by employing 
an  analog  to  digital  converter,  which  transforms  the  sound  waves  into  a  digital  format  that  the  computer 
understands. Advanced speech recognition in AI also includes AI voice recognition, in which the computer can 
recognize the voice of a specific speaker. 

5. 

Improved Spatial Simulation 

Improved spatial simulation is used for binaural processing and reverb. Binaural processing in hearing 
equipment typically employs device communication to recognize and improve the loudest speech signal in the 
environment. Reverb is caused by sound reflecting and echoing off walls, floors, ceilings, or other surfaces. 

Acoustic AI Applications in Healthcare 

The  “Firefly”  app  is  an application  framework  and  underlying  software  development  kit  (SDK),  which  uses 
advanced digital signal processing (DSP) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to detect thorough 
sleep cycles, respiration rate, snoring, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patterns, which can be used to measure 
the  precise  respiratory  rate  of  a  human  in  bed  via  smartphones.  This  application  combines  active  sonar  with 
passive acoustic analysis [109]. The spectral analysis of acoustic signals is used to measure feature vectors and 
validated a series of machine learning methods to provide the most efficient identification of cardiac valve defects 
based  on heart  sounds.  The  convolutional  neural  network  has  shown to be  an  effective  method  for  increasing 
efficiency  [110].  A  new  method  of  automated  sound  processing  based  on  neural  networks  (NNs)  has  been 
introduced in a framework that captures respiratory sounds using an electronic stethoscope. It can recognize four 
types  of  auscultatory  sounds:  wheezes,  rhonchi,  fine  and  coarse  crackles  which  lead  to  a  reduction  in  human 
errors,  while auscultation  sound  perception  [111].  Using  a  deep  CNN-RNN  model  that  classifies  respiratory 
sounds  based  on mel-spectrograms, classification models  and techniques  were  developed to  classify  breathing 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sound anomalies (wheeze, crackle) for automatic diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases proved to be 
an  efficient methodology[112], [113].  Also,  researchers have  used the audio  characteristics  of  coughs  to build 
classifiers that can differentiate various respiratory disorders in adults. 

Furthermore,  they  have used recent  developments  in  generative  adversarial  networks  to  balance  and 
expand a dataset by adding brilliantly constructed synthetic cough samples for each type of serious respiratory 
disease. CoughGAN creates simulated coughs that reflect significant pulmonary symptoms to aid physicians and 
predictive  algorithms  in  detecting  the  early  stages  of  lung  disease.  Thus,  clinicians  will  establish  the  right 
preventative  treatment  plans  and  reduce  morbidity  by  detecting  advanced  respiratory  conditions  like  chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease early and accurately [114]. Most of the research has been conducted in AI-based 
classification of respiratory sound with the use of Noise Masking Recurrent Neural Network (NMRNN) [115], 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) for pediatric breath sound classification [116], back-propagation neural network 
model[117], convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent [118] The 
use of a novel CNN architecture (N-CNN) in conjunction with other CNN architectures (VGG16 and ResNet50) 
to measure pain in newborns from crying sounds. The findings of the experiments show that using innovative N-
CNN  for  measuring  pain  in  neonates  has  much  therapeutic  significance  and  is  a  good  alternative  to  the 
conventional evaluation method [119]. 

Adversarial Attacks on Acoustic AI and Defense 

Figure 15. Taxonomy for Adversarial Attack on Audio. 

Adversarial audio is the sound with perceptible noise, i.e., adversarial perturbations, which can deceive a range 
of sound classification systems. The Figure 15 represents the taxonomy for an adversarial attack on audio signals. 
Some attacks target generating an adversarial audio sample that seems very similar to the original one, but the 
learned model would result in the wrong classification. These attacks come under speech-to-label kind of attacks. 
The attacker can demonstrate genetic algorithms free from gradients to generate adversarial audio samples just by 
accepting original audio and desired output label. It adds random noise but keeps it away from human perception 
[120]. Deceiving the cutting-edge learning systems with undetectable perturbation in audio is made possible by 
Houdini using a probabilistic loss function [121].  An adversary can also try to force desired output in acoustic 
processing while converting speech into text. These attacks are known as speech-to-text attacks. Mel Frequency 
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) parameters of input audio signal can be modified, and then it will be reconstructed 
with reverse MFCC applied to the genuine extracted features [122]. Changing the audio spectrum into the desired 
transcript can be changed by merely adding a small distortion using optimization-based attacks [123].  

The following Figure 16 shows that after processing the audio signal of cough sound, which is perturbed 
by adding frequency, it has changed the prediction from normal cough to bronchitis. These adversarial attacks 
spoil the integrity of AI models. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 16. Adversarial Attack on Acoustic-based Healthcare Application. 

Unfortunately, there are very few studies in the literature on protecting against adversarial audio attacks. 
Constructing a general and strong defensive mechanism to address this issue is still a work in progress. [123] has 
developed a proactive defensive system to restore the original input's structure and eliminate the perturbations. 
General protection against voice recognition systems, which includes code modulation and audio compression. 
Code modulation combines the G.729 narrow-band vocoder-based audio data compression method with PCM to 
modify and convert the audio waveform. By utilizing MP3 compression, audio compression eliminates unwanted 
audio information that surpasses human hearing. [125] has discovered that frame offsets with a blank clip inserted 
at the beginning of audio can deteriorate adversarial perturbations to normal noise by examining the features of 
the automatic speech recognition system. Even though this technique can identify and protect the audio adversarial 
scenario, the perturbations remain as noise, affecting the system's identification accuracy. [126] has deployed two 
adversarial training designs to protect against adversarial attacks: vanilla and unique similarity-based adversarial 
training contribution. Adversarial training intends to train on both actual and fictitious data. However, it needs 
vast adversarial data to train the detector. 

Blockchain Solution for AI-based Healthcare 

AI  can  enhance care  delivery, productivity, and efficiency, allowing healthcare organizations to  get more  and 
better  treatment to  many more  patients.  In addition,  AI  can  help  healthcare  professionals better experience  by 
concentrating on acute care and decreasing stress. According to the literature we studied, NLP, Computer Vision, 
and  Acoustic  AI  are  three  champions  in  processing health  data  that  includes  text,  picture,  and  audio 
simultaneously and assisting medical professionals in diagnosing and treating patients. Though there are far more 
benefits  of  adopting  AI  in  the  healthcare  industry,  certain  threats  still  slow  down  its  acceptance  in  critical 
applications of healthcare. Data, classifier/algorithm, and model are the attack surface of AI. We have studied 
various adversarial attacks independently on text, image, and audio. We came across certain comparative findings 
for adversarial attacks on NLP, computer vision, and acoustic AI, as mentioned in Table 11.

Considering  the adverse  effect  of  such attacks  on  healthcare  applications,  authors have  gone  through 
different defense techniques for adversarial attacks. However, each of the defense techniques has its advantages 
and disadvantages, as discussed in earlier sections. Furthermore, many of the defense techniques are themselves 
AI-based and very specific to kind of adversarial attack. So yet, no defense strategy has been capable of managing 
all sorts of adversarial attacks. Hence, we are proposing a blockchain solution to mitigate those attacks. 

NLP-based Healthcare 

Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP)  is  an innovative  technique  for  improving  information  extraction methods 
where  data  is  discrete.  NLP  algorithms can  be  protected  with  immutable,  tamperproof,  and  trusted  blockchain 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
technology by carrying critical data extracted after NLP algorithms, fulfilling the requirement of data provenance 
and 100% uptime for the system with its distributed nature. As discussed in the above section, NLP suffers from 
various  kinds  of adversarial attacks.  However,  the  complexity  of those  attacks is moderate,  and  in the case of 
textual data, adversarial attacks are easily perceivable by human eyes. Hence, we can conclude that the probability 
of such attacks might be moderate. We have framed blockchain solutions for addressing attack surfaces like data, 
classifier, and model in NLP. 

Synthesized Framework: 

1. 

Dataset Building: 

In NLP, data can reside on local machines of data owners like doctors, hospitals, laboratories, etc. They can build 
a peer-to-peer network of blockchain within distributed owners to resolve the need for sufficiently large data for 
training AI models and at the same time maintain the privacy of data by allowing data owners to not share data 
directly to the third party. This framework supports off-chain storage of data. This peer-to-peer network offers a 
direct exchange of services through a proper authentication mechanism. Thousands of machines can be connected 
without  any centralized  server. The node in  the  P2P  blockchain  network  can  act  as either  requester or  service 
provider. Through smart contracts, access control rules can be implied to have authorized and trusted sharing of 
data.  A  hash  value  is  generated  at  each  data  station  and  maintained  in  blockchain  to  check  distributed  data 
integrity. A hash will be recalculated and validated through blockchain at the time of data utilization for training 
purposes. The following Figure 17 illustrates the dataset building with blockchain for NLP. 

Figure 17. Dataset Building with Blockchain in NLP-based Healthcare Applications. 

Participants in the blockchain network can be various hospitals, diagnosis laboratories, research centers, 
etc., with a database of textual data like clinical reports and notes. There will be peer-to-peer connections within 
each participant, and blockchain will govern their communication. For example, suppose the research center needs 
access to the  dataset  from the  hospital,  then  it  will  initiate a  request  for  data access through a  smart contract. 
Hospitals can respond with an agreement for participation in dataset building, mentioning rules or restrictions for 
data sharing and usage for training AI-model. At each participant, copy of the distributed ledger is available. The 
hash value can be generated and stored in the blockchain as its signature for future integrity checks of data for 
data at each station. In this way, many data stations can contribute to trusted dataset building with blockchain. 

2. 

Training Phase: 

Federated learning comes into the picture to train a learning algorithm using the distributed dataset. Federated 
learning  faces  challenges  like  a  malfunctioned  node,  trust  in  local  gradients,  and  global  gradient  aggregation. 
Leveraging blockchain in federated learning helps solve those challenges and protect the model from poisoning 
attacks. Training can be initiated through a  smart contract so that it can check on the participant’s legitimacy. 

 
 
 
 
Local gradients at federated nodes will then be communicated through block. It will lock local gradients in the 
blockchain to avoid tampering and be used in the future for verification. Miners in the blockchain network will 
validate and generate global gradients using a consensus algorithm. This is how blockchain can bring authenticity 
to  the  federated  network.  Each  node  embeds  extracted  features  in  vector  space,  and  those  will  be  saved  in 
distributed ledger for further use. Word embeddings are a kind of word representation that meaningfully connects 
a human's grasp of knowledge to a machine's understanding. For example, a set of real numbers can be used as a 
depiction  (a  vector). Word embeddings are a  dispersed  representation  of a  text  in an  n-dimensional  space that 
attempts to capture the meanings of the words. The following Figure 18 illustrates the blockchain solution for 
protecting classifier/ algorithm in NLP. 

Figure 18. Blockchain Solution to Protect Training Phase of NLP. 

3. 

Post Training Phase: 

The output of the trained model depends on how genuine the input is in the post-training phase. For adversarial 
text  input,  we  might  expect  malfunctioning  of  the  NLP  model.  By  leveraging  the  blockchain  in  NLP-based 
Healthcare, we can try to mitigate certain adversarial attacks. The blockchain version of extracted features  from 
a dataset used for model training plays an important role in discriminating adversarial text. For the given input, 
word embeddings will be generated through a smart contract. It will look for a similar corpus of word embeddings 
in the distributed ledger based on synonyms. The resultant extracts are further distributed among miners in the 
blockchain network. Instead of proof of work, miners will compute the result for assigned features using a trained 
model. Then results will be shared among miners, and based on a majority of votes, the result will be recorded in 
the blockchain consensually. This framework will defend the model from the synonym-based adversarial attack 
on text as described in Figure 19.

Computer Vision-based Healthcare 

Computers must "understand" an image and comprehend its features to take full advantage of images. Computer 
vision enriches computers with the capabilities to unlock the image data. Computer  visions play a vital role in 
healthcare,  as  discussed  before  but  at  the  same  time  it  also  prone  to  malfunction  due  to  potential  adversarial 
attacks. AI-based healthcare applications cannot survive in such an adversarial environment. After studying the 
adversarial attacks on computer vision, we found that the complexity of adversarial attacks on images is less and 
also  those  are  non-perceivable.  Hence  more  focus  should  be  on  designing  preventive  measures.  Here  we  are 
proposing a systematic strategy to handle the adversarial environment in computer vision with blockchain. 

Synthesized Framework: 

1. 

Dataset Building: 

Images are more prone to adversarial attacks, so we frame solutions focusing on preventive measures, as shown 
in  Figure  20.  Images  will  be  uploaded  to  IPFS  with  the  help  of  blockchain technology.  IPFS is  a  file-sharing 
technology that may be used to store and distribute big files more effectively. It is based on cryptographic hashes, 
which can be effortlessly preserved on a blockchain. Cryptographic hashes are used to validate the integrity of 
images. First, data owners like different hospitals, diagnostic centers request for uploading medical images on 
IPFS.  Smart  contracts  validate  the  data  owner  and  upload  data  on  IPFS.  For  an  uploaded  set  of  images,  a 
cryptographic hash is generated at IPFS, which is further stored in blockchain. The research centers which need 
medical  image  datasets  to  train  an  AI  model  can  request  blockchain  to  access  image  datasets.  Smart  contract 
authenticates the user and provides hash value stored in blockchain for data available in IPFS. Users will approach 
IPFS with hash value and get access to the image dataset. It will be easy to detect adversarial images with hash 
values as small changes in images will drastically change in hash generated. This is how the dataset will be secure 
at IPFS with blockchain.

Training Phase: 

For  visual  inputs,  computer  vision  provides  real-time  data.  Therefore,  we  must  train  our  model  with  image 
datasets, informing the model of what each input shows. This training phase can be protected with blockchain, as 
shown in Figure 21. Research centers must initiate the learning process through smart contracts only after proper 
authentication. Once the model is trained, the extracted features will be stored in blockchain for further reference 
in feature vector x = (x1, x2, x3, …, xn) T, where n gives the number of features extracted and T represents transpose 
operation along with metadata. This framework will protect the training entire training environment for computer 
vision. Thus, we will have a tamper-proof record of features extracted by the learning process.

Post Training Phase: 

In the post-training phase of computer vision-based healthcare, the result generated for given image input should 
be self-explanatory, describing justification for output. Access to the trained model is restricted through  smart 
contracts. Only authorized doctors, researchers can access the model. It will check with stored feature vector in 
distributed  ledger  for  validating  the  integrity  of  model  run.  Here  we  are  introducing  explainable  AI  to  make 
healthcare applications more trustworthy and transparent. Explainable AI (XAI) is a novel concept in machine 
learning that explains how AI systems make black box choices. XAI examines and attempts to clarify the stages 
and models making decisions. XAI prepares the description for output generated for the given input image. The 
metadata of those descriptions is stored in the blockchain for further verification and validation. This is how we 
will  get  a  tamper-proof  and  accurate  comprehensive  diagnosis  with  explanation  in  a  secure  blockchain 
environment as illustrated in Figure 22.

Acoustic AI-based Healthcare 

Most  recent  advancements  and  transformational  possibilities  of  machine  learning  (ML),  particularly  deep 
learning,  in  acoustics.  ML  is  data-driven  in  comparison  to  traditional  acoustics  and  signal  processing.  Thus, 
acoustic  AI can  have  profound  potential in analyzing  acoustic  signals  in  healthcare  applications.  However,  as 
discussed in the above section, healthcare applications have the biggest threat of adversarial attacks, which  are 
harmful in the healthcare domain. Adversarial attacks on acoustic signals are complex and have a moderate level 
of perceivability. Therefore, we can keep acoustic medical data on local machines and impose federated learning 
with blockchain technology to protect acoustic AI-based healthcare applications from adversarial attacks. 

Synthesized Framework: 

1. 

Dataset Building: 

In acoustic AI, data can reside on local machines of data owners like doctors, hospitals, laboratories, etc., as we 
have  framed  blockchain  solution  for  NLP-based  healthcare.  The  following  Figure  23  illustrates  the  dataset 
building with blockchain for acoustic AI-based healthcare. Various IoMT devices can threaten security at each 
data  owner as  rogue devices  can enter  the  IoMT  network, affecting the  data  generation process.  Hence  rogue 
device mitigation strategy based on blockchain can be introduced in dataset building. Through smart contracts, 
access  control  rules  will  be  implied  on  acoustic  data  storage,  and  IoMT  devices  must  go  through  proper 
registration and authentication procedure to contribute to dataset building. Data sharing for dataset building in 
acoustic AI-based healthcare is like the NLP-based healthcare dataset building framework described earlier. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13. Dataset Building in Acoustic AI-based Healthcare with Blockchain. 

2. 

Training Phase: 

As  we  are  keeping  acoustic  data  in  distributed  form,  a  federated  learning  approach  is  adopted  in  our  secure 
framework of training acoustic AI model. Each data owner acts as a node in the network running the local acoustic 
AI  model.  The  extracted  features  from  audio  samples  will  be  kept  secure  in  distributed  ledgers  for  further 
validation and reference. Extracted features of audio samples can be any form based on the learning  approach. 
Suppose we are using a traditional machine learning approach. In that case, it can be Amplitude Envelope, Zero-
Crossing  Rate  (ZCR),  Root  Mean  Square  (RMS)  Energy,  Spectral Centroid,  Band  Energy Ratio,  and  Spectral 
Bandwidth.  For  the  deep  learning  approach,  it  can  be  spectrograms,  Mel-spectrograms,  and  Mel-Frequency 
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Each local gradient is stored in blockchain, and consensus algorithms drive the 
global model  generation task. The learned  global model  is then  available  in  the  distributed  ledger,  preventing 
unauthorized  access  to  the  model.  This  is  how  acoustic  AI  classifier/algorithm  and  model  is  protected  with 
blockchain technology as described in Figure 24. 

Figure 14. Protecting Training Phase of Acoustic AI-based Healthcare with Blockchain.

Post Training Phase: 

In the post-training phase of acoustic AI-based healthcare application, using blockchain adversarial input to the 
model will be identified and keeping secure learned model by restricting access through smart contracts as shown 
in  Figure  25.  Temporal  dependency  is  an  important  characteristic  of  audio  signals.  We  are  using  these 
characteristics and a consensus algorithm to detect whether the input to the model is genuine or adversarial. The 

 
 
 
 
following  Figure  demonstrates  the  blockchain  framework  designed  for  protecting  the  post-training  phase  of 
acoustic AI-based healthcare. Firstly, a smart contract initiates access to the model and gets the result for audio 
input provided by the user. Then original input is passed to the consensus algorithm in blockchain network. It will 
split the input in N number of segments and assign each segment to each miner available in the miner pool. Miners 
will again execute the model for segments, and at the end, all miners consensually combine the result generated 
for each segment. Due to temporal dependency, if that input was adversarial, then aggregated results will not make 
any sense and will be different from the generated output at the first step. This strategy will help detect adversarial 
input to the model and increase trust in the model.

Discussion 

 Blockchain technology gathers real-time data, stores it on several servers to keep it hack resistant, limits access 
to only approved individuals, and maintains an updated version of the file every time it is visited. 

The Survey Outcome: 

This survey aids in comprehending the significance of blockchain in AI-based healthcare applications. According 
to  a  literature  review,  blockchain  technology  offers  more  promising  security,  privacy,  and  trust  in  AI-based 
healthcare  applications.  To  help  improve  the  wide  acceptance  and  making  more  robust  AI  applications  in 
healthcare, authors have synthesized a blockchain framework that can mitigate adversarial attacks considering the 
need  for  individual  Natural  Language  Processing,  Computer  Vision,  and  Acoustic  AI  domains.  Furthermore, 
authors have applied knowledge of blockchain features and properties to protect datasets, classifier/algorithm, and 
AI model from adversarial attacks. Following Figure 26 provides detailed applicability of blockchain properties 
from protecting and validating datasets, protecting classifiers/algorithms protecting the post-training environment 
in AI.

Challenges in the Healthcare Industry to Adopt Blockchain Technology in India 

Due  to  healthcare’s  highly  regulated  environment  and  low-risk  appetite,  the  healthcare  industry  often  adopts 
digital technology late.  

1. 

Lack of Computational Environment 

Blockchain  requires  much  computational  power  to  keep  transaction  information  encrypted.  The  blockchain 
solution uses much electricity and generates heat. India has an electric supply shortage, and the country's typical 
temperature  is  warm.  India  may  consider  decreasing  the  number  of  servers  or  employing  a  single  server  to 

 
 
 
 
conserve power. Blockchain storage facilities should be built in cooler areas with internet access. Most healthcare 
facilities  lack  computers,  patient  data  are  handwritten,  and  internet  access  is  inconsistent.  The  expense  of 
operating  such  a  system must  be  shared equally among  the  government,  healthcare  providers,  pharmaceutical 
companies, insurance companies, and other stakeholders. 

2. 

Lack of Uniform IT System and Interoperability   

There is currently no unified IT system for healthcare in India. Interoperability difficulties arise because of several 
digital  solutions.  Interoperability is  particularly  difficult to establish  since  various  healthcare  facilities  employ 
different  models  and  have  their  own  set  of  codes.  When  patients  switch  service  providers  for  unanticipated 
reasons,  the  problem  becomes  much  worse.  Patients  are  compelled  to  repeat  diagnostic  tests and  treatment 
procedures, increasing overhead expenses and patient dissatisfaction. 
Advancements in Blockchain 
Quantum Blockchain 

1. 

The term "quantum blockchain" can be considered a decentralized, encrypted, and distributed database reliant on 
quantum computing and quantum information theory. The key features of quantum blockchain are security and 
efficiency.  Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) or quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used to 
ensure  communication  security  between  nodes.  As  a  result,  the  characteristics  of  quantum  physics  provide 
network  authentication.  Traditional  encryption  techniques used  in  digital  signatures,  such  as  RSA,  might  be 
deceptive in the face of quantum computer attacks. The quantum digital signature technique can be employed in 
quantum blockchain to overcome this problem. As a result, the quantum blockchain possesses quantum security 
properties. As a result, quantum computers might not be able to attack the quantum blockchain. The blockchain 
with quantum technology also can execute transactions quickly [127]–[129]. 

2. 

Hyperledger  

Hyperledger  is specifically  a  blockchain-based  platform  that  is  being  utilized  to  incorporate  healthcare  data 
management  developments.  Healthcare  applications  built  on  Hyperledger  Fabric  have  emerged  as  a  popular 
blockchain deployment. The linux foundation hosts an open-source community called Hyperledger, seeking to 
offer suitable foundations, rules, libraries, and tools for creating global business blockchain projects. Hyperledger 
is  ideally  suited  for  healthcare  applications.  It  also  provides  complete  control  over  smart  contracts  written  in 
several  computer  languages,  including  Node.js  and  JavaScript.  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum,  on  the  other  hand,  can 
execute seven and fifteen transactions per second, respectively. With transaction speeds of up to 3000 transactions 
per second, Hyperledger beats this competition. Another benefit is that it has a high transaction throughput and 
low transaction cost. Compared to other blockchain frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric is the most sophisticated 
blockchain framework available[130]. 

3. 

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) 

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has been used as one of the most effective methods for meeting transaction secrecy 
requirements.  The  purpose  of ZKP's  functionality  is to  allow  a  prover  to  persuade  a  verifier  of  a certain  truth 
without  exposing  the  real  information.  Interactive  zero-knowledge  proof  and  non-interactive  zero-knowledge 
proof are the two most significant forms of ZKPs. Interactive ZKPs require the prover to execute a sequence of 
activities to convince the verifier of a certain truth. The sequence of activities in interactive ZKPs is linked to 
mathematical  probability  principles.  Non-interactive  ZKPs,  on  the  other  hand,  do  not  include  any  interactive 
elements.  As  in non-interactive ZKPs,  the  prover  may  generate all  challenges  simultaneously,  and  the  verifier 
could reply afterwards. Zero-knowledge- Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs), are 
another significant type of ZKPs that has recently developed. Among the zero-knowledge proof alternatives, zk-
SNARK is the most popular [131]. It can assist in the definition of a quadratic equation that uses public, private, 
and input data to generate evidence. 

4. 

Homomorphic Encryption 

Among  the  most  secure  privacy  enhancing  techniques  for  conducting  operations  on  encrypted  data  is 
homomorphic encryption. The operations on encrypted data would provide the same outcomes as if they were 
done  on  unencrypted  data.  As  a  result,  organizations  may  employ  homomorphic  encryption  for  data  analysis 
without  sacrificing  data  anonymity  or  privacy.  For  privacy-preserving  outsourced  storage  and  computing, 
homomorphic encryption can be leveraged.  Homomorphic encryption makes it possible to encrypt data before 
sending it to commercial cloud environments for processing. Homomorphic encryption may be thought of as an 
evolution  of  asymmetric-key  or  public-key  cryptography.  The  encryption  and  decryption  functions  may  be 
thought of as homomorphisms between plaintext and ciphertext spaces, like homomorphisms in algebra [132], 
[133] 

5. 

Other Distributed Ledger Technologies 

Systemic inadequacies and scalability issues drove researchers to seek solutions outside of the blockchain. As a 
result, there have been innovative and creative inventions such as hashgraph, directed acyclic graph (DAG), and 
holochain  [134],  [135].  In  general,  the  goal  is  to  maintain  blockchain's  original  purpose  alive  in  the  context 
of different challenges. 

 
 
 
 
a) 

Hashgraph 

Hashgraph  is  a  form  of  distributed  ledger  technology  based  on  consensus  building.  The  distributed  ledger 
technology (DLT) especially depends on consensus timestamping to ensure that network transactions agree with 
every node in the network. The consensus algorithm highlights the network's stability and excellence in distributed 
ledger technology. This sort of DLT network, unlike typically distributed ledger technology networks, achieves 
transaction  success  exclusively  by  consensus.  Nodes  on  the  hashgraph  DLT  can  encounter  fairness  thanks  to 
virtual  voting  and  gossip  about  gossip  methods.  Consensus  timestamping  prevents  blockchain  issues  such  as 
transaction cancellation or inclusion on future blocks. Since there is no requirement for proof of work on this DLT 
network, there may be thousands of TPS. 
DAG 

b) 

DAG is a distributed ledger technology that uses consensus methods. Consensus algorithms function in such a 
fashion  that  transactions  that  succeed  just  require  the  network's  majority  support.  There  is  considerably  more 
collaboration and teamwork in such a network, and nodes possess equal opportunities. The primary goal of a DLT 
was  to  democratize  the  internet  economy.  A  private  blockchain  network,  for  example,  is  led  by  a  centralized 
authority, which removes democracy from the DLT. On the other hand, this distributed ledger technology offers 
equal weight to every node in the network. As a result, each node is not required to refer to each other. IOTA's 
Tangle is one of the most famous "current generation" networks that use the DAG data structure.  In this case, 
miners/nodes  can  undertake  dual  functions  that  nodes  in  the  blockchain  do  independently.  This  means  that  a 
Tangle miner can originate and approve a transaction at the same time. 

c) 

Holochain 

Holochain  aspires  to  build  a  distributed  network  that  will  serve  as  the  foundation  for  the  “next-generation 
internet.” Holochain is a hybrid of blockchain, BitTorrent, and Github. This is a DLT that distributes data across 
nodes to limit centralized control over data flow. This distributed platform essentially means that each node will 
run on its chain. This means that nodes or miners are free to operate individually. In addition, users can store data 
using specific keys in what the holochain team refers to as a distributed hash table (DHT). This data, however, 
remains in physical places "distributed” throughout the world. 
Following Table 13 provides a comparison within these Distributed Ledger Technologies.

  Conclusion 

The objective of this SLR is to review the work done in blockchain for robust AI-based healthcare. It has been 
found that very little literature is available in this area. In this study, authors have also presented literature from 
various categories as Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI in healthcare. Further, we 
reviewed articles on the healthcare applications and adversarial attacks they might go through for each category. 
The  potential  for  blockchain  to  change  the  healthcare  business  is  undeniable.  Without  sacrificing  security, 
blockchain may be utilized to protect patients' access to complete medical treatment and as a fantastic method to 
keep  the  healthcare  system's  whole  supply  chain  functioning  smoothly.  The  numerous  characteristics  of  the 
blockchain technology point to one undeniable reality of the potential to balance the conflict between data sharing 
and privacy, especially in AI-based healthcare. Future research directions have been presented in a synthesized 
blockchain framework for NLP, Computer Vision, and Acoustic AI, which was created by combining insights 
from existing applications, adversarial attacks, and threats in existing technology outlined throughout this review 
for AI-based healthcare.
