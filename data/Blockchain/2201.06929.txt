Abstract:  The  distributed  consensus  mechanism  is  the  backbone  of  the  rapidly  developing 

blockchain network. Blockchain platforms consume vast amounts of electricity based on the current 

consensus  mechanism  of  Proof-of-Work  (PoW).  Here,  we  point  out  an  advanced  consensus 

mechanism named Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that can eliminate the extensive energy consumption of 

the current PoW-based blockchain. We comprehensively elucidate the current and projected energy 

consumption and carbon footprint of the PoW and PoS-based Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain 

platforms. The model of energy consumption of PoS-based Ethereum blockchain can lead the way 

towards  the  prediction  of  other  PoS-based  blockchain  technologies  in  the  future.  With  the 

widespread  adoption  of  blockchain  technology,  if  the  current  PoW  mechanism  continues  to  be 

1 

 
 
employed, the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum  can push the global temperature above 

1.5 ℃ in this century. However, a PoS-based blockchain can reduce the carbon footprint by 99% 

compared  to  the  PoW  mechanism.  The  small  amount  of  carbon  footprint  from  PoS-based 

blockchain could make blockchain an attractive technology in a climate friendly future. The study 

sheds light on the urgency and effectiveness of developing the PoS mechanism to solve the current 

sustainability problem of blockchain.  

Main: 

Over  the  last  few  years,  blockchain  technology  has  been  proclaimed  by  many  as  the  most 

significant  technological breakthrough  with the potential to  transform  most  industries1, such as 

finance,  health  care,  Internet-of-Things  networks,  video  games,  and  others2,3.  With  the  help  of 

cryptographic hash functions, digital signatures, and distributed consensus mechanisms, the record 

in  the  distributed  database  can  remove  the  middlemen  and  establish  trust  between  unknown 

parties4.  For  example,  blockchain-based smart  contracts  can  be  partially  or  fully  executed  or 

enforced  without  human  interaction  when  certain  conditions  are  met.  Blockchain-based  digital 

currencies, another famous blockchain application allowing payment accessible to anyone in the 

world, had a total global market capitalization over $2.5 trillion at its peak.  

For all its benefits and forward-facing applications, blockchain uses the energy-intensive method 

of  the  Proof-of-Work  (PoW)  consensus  mechanism  to  verify  and  validate  transactions.  The 

validation of ownerships and transactions is based on network participants adding valid blocks to 

the  chain  through  solving  puzzles  involving  hash  functions5.  Adding  a  block  requires  network 

participants to deploy computational resources to evaluate hash functions that requires a certain 

amount  of  work.  Because  many  active  computational  nodes  are  solving  the  same  hash 

2 

 
simultaneously, total energy consumption is large, resulting in a large carbon footprint that has an 

enormous  impact  on  the  environment6.  Mora  et  al.7  claim  Bitcoin  emissions  alone  could  push 

global warming above 2℃ within less than three decades. Masanet et al.8 have pointed out that the 

scenarios  used  by  Mora  et  al.  are  fundamentally  flawed,  and  provided  their  three  corrected 

scenarios that show the Bitcoin could push global warming exceeds 2℃ by 2100.  

The  accumulation  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  in  the  atmosphere  is  the  primary  driver  of  global 

warming9. Human  forcing  of  climate  change  is  increasing  the  probability  of  severe  ecological 

impacts10 and possibly the crossing of tipping points11,12. According to scenario RCP 8.5 reported 

in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), without intervention, CO2 emissions will 

rise  from  the  current  49 GtCO2eq/yr  to  between  85  and  136  GtCO2eq/yr  by  205013.  The  rising 

CO2 concentration  could  cause  a  global  mean  temperature  change  from  the  pre-industrial  level 

(1880-1900)  to  2100  of  3.8  to  6.0 °C.  The  global  annual  carbon  emission  from  Bitcoin  and 

Ethereum mining is 43.9 Megaton CO2 (MtCO2) in 201714. The energy consumption of blockchain 

is expected to grow by several orders of magnitude in the future8. Such growth has been observed 

based  on  the  experience  with  other  technologies,  e.g.,  in  the  case  of  debit  cards,  stoves,  and 

automobiles. 

Proposed  solutions  to  the  carbon-intensive  problem  in  blockchain  include  developing  efficient 

hardware, reducing the difficulty required to resolve puzzles, or utilizing renewable energy. Each 

method has its own limitations; eg., the saved energy from the more efficient hardware may be 

employed to solve more puzzles for additional reward. The additional reward further incentivizes 

the purchase of more hardware to increase mining hashrate and the chances of higher rewards. 

This situation may also cause other miners to follow the trend to purchase more hardware. The 

vicious circle also limits the motivation for the innovation of more efficient equipment; reducing 

3 

 
the  puzzle  difficulty  may  attract  more  computing  power  onto  the  network;  the  production  of 

renewable  energy  is  subject  to  seasonality  and  may  not  meet  the  consistent  power  demand  of 

blockchain. Here, we evaluate the current energy consumption and carbon footprint of PoW-based 

blockchain  platforms,  and  estimate  the  projected  carbon  footprint  based  on  a  new  consensus 

mechanism, i.e., Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The PoS mechanism eliminates solving puzzles and thus 

dramatically reduces electric power consumption. Instead, in the PoS mechanism, the participants 

are selected by an algorithm for the right to validate blocks. With PoS, the probability of validating 

a block depends on the amount of stake a blockchain participant holds. The results of our model 

of  energy  consumption  and  carbon  footprint  from  PoS-based  blockchain  demonstrate  that  PoS 

mechanism  can  reduce  carbon  emissions  by  two  orders  of  magnitude  compared  to  PoW 

mechanism. The migration from PoW to PoS may fundamentally solve the urgent energy-intensity 

problem in the blockchain system. 

Proof-of-Work Consensus Mechanism 

PoW-based  blockchain,  like  Bitcoin,  uses  enormous  amounts  of  energy  to  secure  its  network. 

Validation of blockchain by the Proof-of-Work consensus is computationally intensive. The PoW 

mechanism was first introduced in 1993 to combat spam emails15 and was formally called “Proof-

of-Work” in 199916. This technology was not widely used until Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin 

in  20094.  This  mechanism  could  be  employed  to  reach  consensus  between  many  nodes  on  a 

network  and  thereby  secure  the  Bitcoin  blockchain.  However,  the  PoW  mechanism  works  by 

employing many nodes to solve a cryptographic puzzle. The miner who first finds the solution 

receives a mining reward in the form of Bitcoin. The PoW consensus process is shown in Fig. 1a.  

based on previous studies5,17,18. The main drivers of the energy consumption of Bitcoin were found 

to be the geographical distribution of miners and the efficiency of the mining equipment19. de Vries 

4 

 
proposed a market dynamics approach to evaluate the current methods for obtaining the Bitcoin 

consumes  87.1  TWh  of  electrical  energy  annually  per  September  30,  201920.  The  energy 

consumption of Bitcoin is enough to power 9 million households in the US or the entire country 

of Belgium or Chile21. de Vries22 also claimed the total network of Bitcoin could consume up to 

184 TWh per year with 60% of miner’s income going to pay for electricity at a price of $0.05 per 

kWh  if  the  price  of  BTC  is  $42,000.  For  comparison,  the  current  total  annual  electricity 

consumption is about 26,000 TWh in the world. 

The Migration from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism  

Eliminating  the  high  energy  consumption  of  blockchain  is  critical  to  its  survival.  Aiming  to 

overcome  the  issues  of  energy  consumption  and  low  transaction  speed,  moving  to  the  PoS 

mechanism is an effective path for the sustainable development of Bitcoin and other PoW-based 

blockchain platforms. There are various difficulties in migrating the PoW mechanism to the PoS 

mechanism on Bitcoin, such as a conflict of interest of miners. However, Bitcoin can be built on 

the PoS mechanism in theory; a potential way to do this could be to leverage the pre-existing full 

and  light  node  network to  implement  a  PoS  style  solution.  Once  the  PoS  mechanism  on  other 

blockchain platforms is proven, that Bitcoin can adapt to it.23 

Ethereum24 pioneers a plan for transition from the current energy-intensive and low-throughput 

PoW mechanism to a more robust, efficient and energy-saving PoS mechanism. The upgrade of 

Ethereum from 1.0 (PoW mechanism) to 2.0 (PoS mechanism) includes three phases: Phase 0 - 

Beacon Chain, Phase 1 - Shard Chains, and Phase 2 - State Execution25. The mainnet of Phase 0 – 

Beacon Chain has been launched in Dec. 2020, and more than 140000 validator clients have joined 

the  mainnet.  The  migration  process  of  Ethereum  has  been  introduced  in  the  Supplementary 

Materials. The success migration on Ethereum can be used as a reference for Bitcoin. Therefore, 

5 

 
this study analyzes the architecture of the PoS mechanism on Ethereum and calculates the energy 

consumption and carbon footprint of both PoW and PoS mechanisms. This study will provide the 

basis for Ethereum to deliver an accurate carbon footprint of its PoS mechanism. The mathematical 

model of energy consumption of PoS-based Ethereum blockchain can lead the way towards the 

prediction of energy consumptions of other PoS-based blockchain technologies in the future.  

Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism 

The  first  Proof-of-Stake  cryptocurrency,  Peercoin26,  was  developed  by  Sunny  King  and  Scott 

Nadal in 2012. The stake in the Peercoin network is coin age, i.e., network tokens times holding 

period. However, participants in the Peercoin network still need to solve a cryptographic puzzle, 

whose difficulty decreases with a higher coin age. Thus, the Proof-of-Stake consensus of Peercoin 

is a hybrid PoS/PoW. In the state-of-the-art PoS networks, the coin age is replaced by the number 

of network tokens  a participant  holds, and the PoW puzzle is  completely removed.  Miners  are 

replaced by stakers who lock up network tokens as stakes in the ecosystem. The proposers of the 

new block (who can receive the block reward) are selected based on their stakes in PoS networks, 

instead of their computational power in PoW networks. Fig. 1b shows the working process of the 

PoS mechanism.  

6 

 
Fig.  1.  Comparison  of  (a) Proof-of-Work  and  (b)  Proof-of-Stake  mechanisms.  With  Proof-of-work  (a), 

miners own computing power to compete against each other to complete transactions on the network and 

get  rewarded.  The  hashrate  share  represents  the  share  of  the  computing  power  owned  by  one  miner 

occupying the total computing power of the whole network. If a miner manages to solve the puzzle, the 

new “Block n” is considered confirmed and connected to the previous block. Quantum computer is able to 

break the mathematical difficulty underlying most of currently used cryptography. The only solution in this 

case is to transit to a new type of cryptography, which is considered to be inherently resistant to quantum 

attacks27. Proof-of-Stake (b) is a proposed alternative to PoW. With Proof-of-Stake, the resource that is 

compared is the amount of share a staker holds. For example, someone holding 1% of the Bitcoin (share) 

can  own  1%  of  the  probability  to  validate  the  next  block.  Different  PoS-based  platforms  have  some 

differences in their algorithms. For example, PoS of Ethereum is the underlying mechanism that activates 

7 

 
 
validators upon receipt of enough stake. Users will need to stake 32 ETH (Ethereum Tokens) to become a 

validator. Validators are chosen randomly to create blocks and are responsible for checking and confirming 

blocks they do not create. A user's stake is also used as a way to incentivize good validator behavior28. 

Another example is Algorand that was launched in 2019 by Dr. Silvio Micali29 and his team from MIT. 

Algorand uses a unique variation of Proof of Stake called Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS). PPoS is a highly 

democratized PoS consensus mechanism with a low minimum staking requirement for participating in and 

securing the network — only 1 ALGO coin is required to participate29. A PoS-based blockchain has more 

validators means a more secure and decentralized system. 

The Advantages and Disadvantages of Proof-of-Stake Mechanism 

The Proof-of-Stake mechanism has advantages over Proof-of-Work mechanism: 

1.  PoS is fairer compared to PoW. A staker must deposit an amount of coins into the network 

as a stake in PoS. The size of the stake determines the chances of a staker to be chosen to 

forge the next block which is a linear correlation. With PoW, rich participants can take 

advantage of the power of economies at scale. The more mining equipment they buy, the 

lower prices of per mining equipment they can obtain.  

2.  PoS  is  less  expensive  because  PoS-based  blockchain  does  not  require  costly  mining 

equipment  and  extensive  electricity  for  mining,  but  only  requires  hosting  a  node.  This 

change encourages more participants to set up a node. The barriers to entry are lower and 

should remain at a constant level.   

3.  PoS  makes  the  network  more  decentralized  and  secure.  Staking  is  more  decentralized 

thanks to the lower barrier to entry. PoW has mining pools where participants are teaming 

up to mine. These pools now control 80% mining power of the bitcoin blockchain.  If a 

group of miners can obtain 51% of the hashing power, they can effectively manage the 

blockchain and start approving fraudulent transactions.  

8 

 
4.  PoS is a more energy-efficient mechanism. PoS does not allow everyone to mine for new 

blocks  by  solving  puzzles  simultaneously  and  therefore  uses  considerably  less  energy. 

Validators on PoS are chosen at random to create blocks and are responsible for checking 

and confirming blocks they do not create, that allows PoS to handle higher scalability and 

larger throughput. The transaction verification time on PoW can be reduced by reducing 

its  difficulty,  or  reducing  the  data  size  of  transactions.  These  ways  may  increase  the 

transaction throughput to a limited extent. However, the possibility of forks and vicious 

attacks cannot be ignored. PoS intends to provide scalability that is orders of magnitude 

greater than what is currently available PoW. For example, a jump from roughly 10 TPS 

on PoW-based Ethereum to potentially 100,000 TPS on PoS-based Ethereum. 

PoS also has its concerns: 

1.  PoS  has  to  carefully  select  the  next  block  proposers.  Developers  need  to  design  a  fair 

algorithm. A fair algorithm factors in the size of the stake and progressively disfavors the 

holders  of  large  numbers  of  stakes,  i.e.,  adopt  an  “under-proportional”  policy,  select 

proposer  =  constant  ×  log  (stakes).  Additionally,  sharding  design  ensures  that  someone 

staking more tokens needs to validate more blocks without more rewards. 

2.  PoS has a weak subjectivity issue in which a client needs to log on at least a few times a 

year, or else validators who has already withdrew their deposits can attack that client at no 

cost.  This  issue  is  impossible  to  avoid  entirely,  but  features  like  the  withdrawal  queue, 

allows  the  period  the  client  can  safely  go  between  logging  in  without making  validator 

withdrawals take too long in the normal case. 

3.  PoS is more complex to implement compared to PoW. There are many risks during the 

implementation of PoS, and serious flaws of code may be fatal. This is the main trade-off 

9 

 
of PoS. PoW entrusts complexity to the power consumption of mining, so it can enhance 

security  by  using  external  resources.  The  security  of  PoS  has  to  be  solved  by 

extremely careful designs and might still fail eventually. The threat of a 51% attack still 

exists in proof-of-stake, but it is riskier for the attackers. For example, if Bitcoin is running 

on PoS, attackers need to control 51% of the staked BTC execute an attack. Not only is the 

staked BTC worth hundreds of billions of dollars, but it would probably cause BTC's value 

to drop. There is very little incentive to destroy the value of a currency attackers have a 

majority stake in. 

The Energy Consumption and Carbon Footprint of PoW-based Ethereum and Bitcoin 

Here, we present a techno-economic model for determining the electricity consumption and carbon 

footprint  of  PoW  based  Ethereum  and  Bitcoin.  Our  analysis  is  based  on  mining  revenue  and 

hardware data for estimating energy consumption and carbon emission. Determining an accurate 

level of electricity consumption by Ethereum is unrealistic because of the great variety of Graphics 

Processing Units (GPUs) used for mining30. Instead, we bracket the solution range with an upper 

and a lower limit. The upper limit is set as the break-even point of mining revenues and electricity 

costs. Rational behavior would lead miners to disconnect their hardware from the network as soon 

as their costs exceed their revenues from mining and validation. For example, the price drop of 

ETH  token  drove  miners  to  stop  mining  in  2019,  reducing  the  upper  limit  of  electricity 

consumption on Ethereum. The lower limit is defined by a scenario in which all miners use the 

most  efficient  hardware  in  each  year31,  as  reported  in  Data  Sheet  1.1.  The  efficiency  of  the 

hardware is an essential parameter in determining energy consumption. The calculation details are 

introduced in the Supplementary Materials. Based on the geographical footprint of Ethereum nodes 

and the household electricity prices of the countries where nodes are located, we can calculate the 

10 

 
weighted average of the electricity price and carbon emission factor of nodes running on the PoW-

based  Ethereum.  The  calculation  is  expressed  in  detail  in  Supplementary  Materials  and  data  is 

listed in Data Sheet 2.2-2.3. Fig. 2 shows the location of the nodes that are identified based on 

device  IPs.  The  weighted  average  of  the  electricity  price  and  carbon  emission  factor  of  nodes 

running on Bitcoin has been reported in Data Sheet 2.4-2.5. 

Fig. 2. The geographical footprint of Ethereum 1.0 full nodes as reported in Data Sheet 2.1. This geographic 

footprint allows for an accurate estimation of energy consumption and carbon emissions as reported in Data 

Sheet 2.6.  

Fig. 3 shows annual electricity consumption and carbon footprint of Ethereum and Bitcoin. The 

figure  shows  that  the  annual  electricity  consumption/carbon  footprint  of  the  upper  limit  of 

Ethereum has increased from 0.67 TWh/0.32 MtCO2 in 2016 to 11.91 TWh/5.15 MtCO2 in 2020. 

The electricity consumption/carbon footprint of the lower limit follows the same trend as the upper 

limit, increasing from 0.27 TWh/0.13 MtCO2 to 2.22 TWh/0.96 MtCO2 from 2016 to 2020. The 

11 

 
  
upper limit  of Bitcoin has increased from  5.60  TWh/4.04 MtCO2 in  2016 to  56.42 TWh/38.61 

MtCO2 in 2020. The lower limit of Bitcoin has increased from 1.31 TWh/0.63 MtCO2 in 2016 to 

31.50 TWh/13.61 MtCO2 in 2020. Although the decrease in market price resulted in a reduction 

of electricity consumption in 2019 because of higher price decreases in the crypto market, the one 

order  of  magnitude  increase  of  energy  consumption  since  2016  has  raised  concerns  about  the 

sustainability of blockchain technology due to its rapidly growing carbon footprint. 

Fig. 3. Annual electricity consumption and carbon footprint estimates of the PoW-based Ethereum on its 

lower limit (a) and upper limit (b), and Bitcoin on its lower limit (c) and upper limit (d). Note that the 

weighted average emission factor electricity price, internet price, and energy intensity of each country and 

each  year  from  2016-2010  were  used  to  calculate  the  electricity  and  carbon  emission  of  Ethereum  and 

Bitcoin blockchain. These numbers are reported in Data: Sheet 2.2 – 2.6.

The Energy Consumption and Carbon Footprint of PoS-based Ethereum 

A pseudo agent-based model of a blockchain system with PoS has been used to calculate the energy 

consumption32. Here, we build a realistic model based on Ethereum’s PoS mechanism.  

A typical staker setup on Ethereum 2.0 consists of one Beacon node program and multiple validator 

client programs running on a computer with Internet connection. Each validator client program 

requires a minimum stake of 32 ETH. On Ethereum 2.0, the computing cost of running the Beacon 

node  program  is  identical  to  that  of  a  full  node  program  (e.g.,  Geth)  on  Ethereum  1.033.  The 

validator  client  program  on  Ethereum  2.0  plays  a  similar  role  as  the  miner  on  Ethereum  1.0. 

However, unlike miners on PoW-based Ethereum 1.0, the validator client program is resource-

efficient, and its energy consumption is significantly less than that of the Beacon node program. 

As  a  result,  the  energy  consumption  of  running  validator  client  programs  is  assumed  to  be 

negligible.  

The lower limit of the carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 is defined by a scenario in which all stakers 

use  the  energy-efficient  Jetson  TX2  module  (5W)  to  run  Beacon  node  programs  and  validator 

client  programs.  This  lower  limit  of  annual  energy  consumption  and  its  carbon  footprint  for 

Ethereum  2.0  comes  out  at  0.0396  TWh  and  0.0171  MtCO2,  respectively.  In  this  scenario,  the 

calculated total number of Beacon nodes running on Ethereum 2.0 is 903569 (See the calculation 

details in Supplementary Materials).  

The upper limit of the carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 is defined by a scenario in which all stakers 

use the Intel Xeon server34 to run Beacon node programs and validator client programs resulting 

in 0.3119 TWh and 0.1348 MtCO2, respectively. In this scenario, the total number of Beacon nodes 

running on Ethereum 2.0 is 439507. Given that the total number of full nodes on Ethereum 1.0 is 

13 

 
less than 7000, the PoS-based Ethereum 2.0 is expected to be capable of achieving a significantly 

higher level of decentralization with a much lower carbon footprint than PoW-based Ethereum 1.0.  

Projected Carbon Footprints of PoW and PoS-based Blockchain Platforms 

The future usage of blockchain is a topic of considerable discussion because it is a promising and 

revolutionary technology. Wide usage of blockchain would result in a large carbon footprint. The 

energy consumption of Ethereum and Bitcoin exceeds 88% of the energy consumption of the entire 

blockchain space14; therefore, we mainly consider Ethereum and Bitcoin in this section.  

Blockchain usage has experienced accelerated growth (Supplementary Fig. 1), which is a typical 

pattern during the early adoption of broadly used technologies. Fig. 4a shows trends in the adoption 

of  broadly  used  technologies  over  time.  To  develop  a  scenario  for  blockchain  we  used  the 

incorporation rate of 36 different techniques for which data are readily available, such as debit 

cards, stoves, automobiles, water closets, and so on (See details in Data Sheet: 3.1-3.2). The inset 

figure in Fig. 4a shows the historical adoption rate of ETH and BTC in the past 5 and 11 years, 

respectively.  If  PoW-based  Ethereum  were  to  follow  the  median  growth  trend  observed  in  the 

adoption of these 36 technologies, the cumulative CO2 emissions of this blockchain alone could 

warm the planet 0.26 to 0.43 °C by 2120, shown in Fig. 4b. We conduct an uncertainty analysis 

on  the  impact  of  carbon  emissions  on  global  temperature.  The  correlation  coefficient  between 

carbon emissions and global temperature is from the temperature projections of 42 Earth system 

models developed for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Purple right Y 

axis shows lower bound of uncertainty by carbon emission on temperature change, orange right Y 

axis shows the average value on temperature change, and green right Y axis shows the upper bound 

on temperature change. Fig. 4d shows the total cumulative CO2 emissions of PoW-based Ethereum 

and PoW-based Bitcoin could warm the planet 6.23 to 10.16 °C by 2120. Another logistic growth 

14 

 
model and its accuracy to predict the carbon footprint of blockchain have been proposed in the 

Supplementary  Materials.  The  development  of  Ethereum  and  Bitcoin  is  highly  dynamic  and 

sensitive. The two projection models existing reasonable assumptions provide a baseline of Life 

Cycle  Analysis  to  show  PoW-based  blockchain  consumes  extensive  energy  nowadays  and  its 

energy cost will be more outrageous in the near future.

Fig. 4 Projected Carbon Footprints of PoW and PoS-based Blockchain based on the adoption model. Fig 

4a shows trends in the adoption of broadly used technologies documented in Data: Sheet 3.1. The  blue 

shaded area indicates the margins of the upper 75% and lower 25% quantiles, and the thick black line is the 

median  tendency  across  technologies  (see  Data:  Sheet  3.1).  Grey  lines  indicate  trends  for  each  of  the 

technologies (see Data: Sheet 3.2). The inset figure shows the adoption rate of ETH and BTC of its own 

development in the past 5 and 11 years, respectively. Fig 4b and 4c show the projected cumulative CO2 

emissions and the resulting temperature rise from PoW-based Ethereum 1.0 and PoS-based Ethereum 2.0, 

respectively, if they were to follow the average growth rate of broadly adopted technologies. Fig 4d and 4e 

show the projected cumulative CO2 emissions and the resulting temperature rise from PoW-based Ethereum 

1.0 plus PoW-based Bitcoin, and PoS-based Ethereum 2.0 plus PoS-based Bitcoin, respectively, under the 

average  growth  rate  of  technologies  shown  in  Fig.  4a.  We  conduct  an  uncertainty  analysis  on  the 

relationship between carbon emissions and the increase in global temperature. Purple right Y axis shows 

lower  bound  of  uncertainty  by  carbon  emission  on  temperature  change,  orange  right  Y  axis  shows  the 

average value on temperature change, and green right Y axis shows the upper bound on temperature change. 

The Data is shown in Data: Sheets 3.1–3.8. 

The utilization of renewable energy can reduce carbon emissions to some extent.  One estimate 

claims 39% energy consumption of Bitcoin mining is from renewable energy35. However, this will 

not solve the sustainability problem of blockchain36, which is not limited to Ethereum and Bitcoin 

but  shared  by  the  whole  blockchain  industry.  Given  the  decentralized  nature  of  blockchain,  its 

computing  verification  process  of  the  overall  system  must  migrate  to  the  PoS  mechanism  that 

could  help  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  Ethereum  by  99%.  Fig.  4c  shows  in  100  years,  the 

cumulative carbon emission from PoS-based Ethereum is 17 GtCO2 pushing the temperature to 

increase less than 3% of the carbon emission from PoW-based Ethereum shown in Fig. 4b. We 

can estimate the energy consumption of PoS-based Bitcoin in accordance with the mathematical 

17 

 
model of PoS-based Ethereum established in the study. Fig. 4d shows the carbon emission from 

PoS-based Ethereum and Bitcoin. The temperature increase from PoS-based Ethereum and Bitcoin 

can  be  reduced  to  0.16  ℃  to  0.27  ℃  compared  to  6.23  ℃  to  10.16  ℃  caused  by  PoW-based 

Ethereum and Bitcoin in 100 years at the case of the average value of temperature change. The 

energy  consumption  of  different  PoS-based  blockchain  platforms,  such  as  Algorand29  or 

Avalanche37, are different due to their altered algorithms, but the energy consumption of all PoS-

based  blockchain  platforms  can  reduce  significantly  in  comparison  to  PoW-based  blockchain. 

There are other potential ways  could  be deployed on blockchain  for sustainable outcomes. For 

example, Delegated proof of stake (DPoS) and the ‘delegated Byzantine fault tolerance’ (DBFT) 

models use negligible amounts of energy to grant validating power to stake-holding nodes38. 

The study suggests that if the adoption rate of PoW-based blockchain follows other broadly used 

technologies or logistic growth model, it could create an electricity demand capable of producing 

enough CO2 emissions to exceed 1.5 °C of global warming in decades. The analysis of electricity 

consumption and carbon emission elucidate that any further development of  blockchain should 

shift towards to PoS mechanism to reduce the electricity demand if the consequences of 1.5 °C of 

global warming is aiming to be avoided. The change of the migration from PoW to PoS mechanism 

will profoundly affect the energy consumption and the sustainable development of blockchain.

The Calculation of Energy Consumptions and Carbon Footprints of PoW Based ETH  

The lower limit is defined by a scenario in which all miners use the most efficient hardware in 

each  year.  We  calculate  the  lower  limit  of  the  range  by  multiplying  the  required  computing 

power—indicated by the hash rate—by the energy efficiency of the most efficient hardware: 

Lower Limit 

𝐸𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟

𝑃𝑜𝑊   = 𝐻 ∗ 𝑒𝑒𝑓 ∗ 10−3 ∗ 24  

(1) 

with 

𝑃𝑜𝑊 = power consumption of lower limit [MWh] 

𝐸𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟

𝐻 = hash rate [GH/s] 

𝑒𝑒𝑓 = energy efficiency of most efficient hardware [J/MH] 

The  upper  limit  is  defined  by  the  break-even  point  of  revenues  and  electricity  cost.  Rational 

behavior would lead miners to disconnect their hardware from the network as soon as their costs 

exceed their revenues from mining and validation: 

Upper Limit 

with 

𝑃𝑜𝑊   =

𝐸𝑈𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟

(𝑅𝐵 + 𝑅𝑇 + 𝑅𝑈 + 𝑅𝑈𝐼) ∗ 𝑀
𝑝𝑁

∗

1000

(2)

𝑃𝑜𝑊 = average daily power consumption of upper limit [MWh] 

𝐸𝑈𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟

𝑅𝐵 = block reward [ETH] 

𝑅𝑇 = transaction fees [ETH] 

𝑅𝑈 = uncle reward [ETH] 

𝑅𝑈𝐼 = uncle including reward [ETH] 

𝑀 = market price [USD/ETH] 

𝑝𝑁 = electricity price [USD/kWh] 

Based on the geographical footprint of Ethereum nodes and the household electricity prices of the 

countries where nodes are located, we can calculate the weighted average of the electricity price 

and carbon emission factor of nodes running on the Ethereum 1.0 network. The weighted carbon 

factor  n  is  0.4592  kg  CO2eq/kWh.  The  lower  limit  and  upper  limit  of  carbon  footprint  is 

𝐸𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟

𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛   =   𝐸𝐿𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟

𝑃𝑜𝑊 ∗ 𝑛 and 𝐸𝑈𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟

𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛   =   𝐸𝑈𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟

𝑃𝑜𝑊 ∗ 𝑛, respectively. 

The Migration of Ethereum from PoW Consensus Mechanism to PoS Consensus Mechanism   

The upgrade of Ethereum from 1.0 (PoW consensus mechanism) to 2.0 (PoS consensus mechanism) 

includes 3 phases: Phase 0 - Beacon Chain, Phase 1 - Shard Chains, and Phase 2 - State Execution1.  

Phase 0 will launch the PoS Beacon Chain. It is the most crucial step of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade 

since  it  introduces  Casper2,  a  PoS  consensus  mechanism  to  the  network  for  the  first  time.  The 

Beacon  Chain  is  the  core  system-level  blockchain  of  Ethereum  2.0,  and  it  manages  the  PoS 

protocol for itself in Phase 0. In Phase 1, the Beacon chain will also manage all of the shard chains. 

Specifically, the functions of Beacon Chain will include (1) managing stakers and their stakes; (2) 

3 

 
randomly selecting block proposers based on stakes; (3) applying rewards and penalties to stakers; 

(4) facilitating cross-shard transactions (in phase 1 and onwards).  

In  Phase  1,  the  introduction  of  shard  chains  will  further  increase  transactions  throughput  of 

Ethereum  2.0  by  dividing  the  network  across  multiple  shards,  achieving  parallel  processing  of 

transactions. Sometime after phase 1, the existing Ethereum 1.0 PoW chain will be shut down, and 

its accounts, states, as well as its applications will be moved to the Ethereum 2.0 PoS chain. 

In  Phase  2,  Ethereum  flavored  WebAssembly  (eWASM)  that  supports  PoS  and  sharding  will 

replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts and accounts will be migrated from 

the  PoW-based  Ethereum  1.0  network  to  PoS-based  Ethereum  2.0  network.  After  phase  2, 

Ethereum  team  plans  to  work  on  optimizations  using  cryptography  primarily,  for  example 

polynomial commitments, snarks, to make the blockchain safer and cheaper to verify. 

On Ethereum 1.0, a full  node is a computer connected to the Ethereum network that stores the 

entire blockchain and enforces the consensus rules of Ethereum. Miners on Ethereum 1.0 need to 

connect  to  a  full  node  to  validate  the  new  blocks  by  solving  the  PoW  puzzle.  The  energy 

consumption of Ethereum 1.0 is primarily attributed to the process of solving PoW puzzles. Loghin 

et al3 reported that the energy-efficient Jetson TX2 module can run an Ethereum full node with 

5W power consumption, which could serve as the lower bound for the energy consumption of an 

Ethereum full node. The power consumption of a high-performance Intel Xeon server running an 

Ethereum full node is 81W3, which could serve as the upper bound for the energy consumption of 

an Ethereum full node.  

The mainnet of Phase 0 – Beacon Chain has been launched in Dec. 20204, and more than 140000 

validator  clients  have  joined  the  mainnet.  Note  that  the  specifications  of  the  Shard  Chains  and 

4 

 
eWASM are not finalized and are still under extensive research and development. Meanwhile, the 

Beacon Chain, which manages all the Shard Chains and applies the consensus rules, accounts for 

the dominant part of the energy consumption of the Ethereum 2.0 network. In the following, we 

predict the carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 network based on the specifications of the Beacon 

Chain.  

The Calculation of Energy Consumptions and Carbon Footprints of PoS Based ETH 

Note that staking more than 32 ETH on a validator client program does not generate more reward 

than staking exactly 32 ETH. Thus, we assume that all the validator client programs on Ethereum 

2.0 network stake 32 ETH. So the total number of validator client programs on Ethereum 2.0, 𝑁𝑣𝑎𝑙, 

is  

𝑁𝑣𝑎𝑙 = 𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒/32 

(3) 

where 𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 is the total ETH stake on Ethereum 2.0. Assuming zero downtime for all validator 

client programs, the annual return of running a single validator client program, 𝑔𝑣𝑎𝑙, is5 

𝑔𝑣𝑎𝑙 =

5792.6176 ∗ 𝑝𝐸𝑇𝐻
√𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒

(4) 

where 𝑝𝐸𝑇𝐻 is  the  average  price  of  ETH  in  a  year  (in  US  dollar  per  ETH  [USD/ETH]).  In  the 

following, we will use the average price of ETH in 2020 to calculate the projected carbon footprint 

of Ethereum 2.0.  

𝑝𝐸𝑇𝐻 = 307.5429 [USD/ETH]  

(5) 

Based on the geographical footprint of nodes and the household electricity prices of the countries 

where nodes are located, we can calculate the weighted average of the electricity price of nodes 

running on Ethereum 2.0 network, 𝑝̅𝑒𝑙𝑒 (see Data Sheet 2.3: Electricity_Internet): 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
𝑝̅𝑒𝑙𝑒 = 0.1783 [USD/kWh] 

(6) 

Similarly, we can obtain the weighted average of the internet price of nodes running on Ethereum 

2.0 network, 𝑝̅𝑖𝑛𝑡 (see Data Sheet 2.3: Electricity_Internet): 

𝑝̅𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 39.5777 [USD/month]  

(7) 

The weighted average of the emission factor of nodes running on Ethereum 2.0 network, 𝑒̅𝑒𝑓 (see 

Data sheet 2.2: Emission factors, we apply emission factors from the IEA6): 

𝑒̅𝑒𝑓   = 0.4323 [kgCO2eq/kWh]  

(8) 

The staker cost consists of computer cost, electricity cost and Internet cost. The depreciation period 

for computer is commonly 3 years. Thus, the expression of annual cost of a staker on Ethereum 

2.0, 𝑐𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒, is 

𝑐𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 =

𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚
3

+

365 ∗ 24 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑒𝑙𝑒
1000

+ 12 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑖𝑛𝑡 

(9) 

with 

𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚 = computer price [USD] 

𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 = energy consumption of a computer running a Beacon node program [W] 

We  assume  that  all  stakers  use  the  typical  staker  setup  mentioned  above,  and  the  ratio  of  the 

validator client programs to Beacon node programs running on a computer, 𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙, is defined by the 

break-even point of staking rewards and staker cost. The expression of 𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 is  

𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 = 𝑐𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒/𝑔𝑣𝑎𝑙 

(10) 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Because it is assumed that all validators adopt the typical setup mentioned above. The total number 

of Beacon nodes, 𝑁𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒, is 

𝑁𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 = 𝑁𝑣𝑎𝑙/𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 

Combining equation (3,4,10,11), we derive: 

𝑁𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 =

√𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒/32 ∗ 5792.6176 ∗ 𝑝𝐸𝑇𝐻 
𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚/3 + 365 ∗ 24/1000 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑒𝑙𝑒 + 12 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑖𝑛𝑡

The projected annual energy consumption of Ethereum 2.0 network, 𝐸 [TWh], is 

𝐸 =

365 ∗ 24 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ 𝑁𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒
1012

Combining equation (12-13), we derive: 

(11) 

(12) 

(13) 

𝐸 =

365 ∗ 24 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ √𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒/32 ∗ 5792.6176 ∗ 𝑝𝐸𝑇𝐻 
1012 ∗ (𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚/3 + 365 ∗ 24/1000 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑒𝑙𝑒 + 12 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑖𝑛𝑡)

(14) 

The projected annual carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 network, 𝐶 [MtCO2], is 

𝐶 = 𝐸 ∗ 𝑒̅𝑒𝑓  

(15) 

Combining equation (14,15), we derive: 

𝐶 =

365 ∗ 24 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ √𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒/32 ∗ 5792.6176 ∗ 𝑝𝐸𝑇𝐻   ∗ 𝑒̅𝑒𝑓
1012 ∗ (𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚/3 + 365 ∗ 24/1000 ∗ 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑒𝑙𝑒 + 12 ∗ 𝑝̅𝑖𝑛𝑡)

(16) 

According  to  equation  (16), 𝐶 increases  as 𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒 increases.  On  March  10th,  2020,  the  total 

supply of Ethereum is 110030966 ETH. In the following discussion, we assume: 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
    
 
   
 
 
  
 
𝐸𝑇𝐻𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒   = 110030966 [ETH]  

(17) 

That is, we assume that 100% ETH on Ethereum network is staked.  

The lower limit of the carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 is defined by a scenario in which all stakers 

use  the  energy-efficient  Jetson  TX2  module  to  run  Beacon  node  programs  and  validator  client 

programs.  The  price  of  Jetson  TX2  module  is  490.64  USD7,  so  𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚 = 490.64 USD .  As 

mentioned  above,  Jetson  TX2  is  expected  to  run  a  Beacon  node  program  at   𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 = 5 W.  By 

substituting 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚 and 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 of Jetson TX2 and equation (5,6,7,8,17) into equation (14) and (16), 

we obtain the lower limit of energy consumption and carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 are 0.0396 

TWh and 0.0171 MtCO2, respectively. In this scenario, the total number of Beacon nodes running 

on Ethereum 2.0 is 903569.  

The upper limit of the carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 is defined by a scenario in which all stakers 

use the high-performance Intel Xeon server3 to run Beacon node programs and validator client 

programs. The Dell hardware customization service is utilized to calculate the price of the Intel 

Xeon server. The CPU of Intel Xeon server is Intel® Xeon® E5-1650 v3, which is discontinued. 

We  use  the  currently  available  Intel®  Xeon®  E-2246G  (of  similar  performance  with  Intel® 

Xeon® E5-1650 v3) to replace the discontinued Intel® Xeon® E5-1650 v3 in evaluating the price 

of the server. The price of the server is 2181.72 USD, so 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚 = 2181.72 USD. As mentioned 

above,  the  Intel  Xeon  server  is  expected  to  run  a  Beacon  node  program  at   𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 = 81 W.  By 

substituting 𝑝𝑐𝑜𝑚 and 𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑚 of the Intel Xeon server and equation (5,6,7,8,17) into equation (14) 

and (16), we obtain the upper limit of energy consumption and carbon footprint of Ethereum 2.0 

are 0.3119 TWh and 0.1348 MtCO2, respectively. In this scenario, the total number of Beacon 

nodes running on Ethereum 2.0 is 439507. Given the total number of full nodes on Ethereum 1.0 

8 

 
 
is less than 7000, the PoS-based Ethereum 2.0 is expected to be capable of achieving significantly 

higher  level  of  decentralization  with  a  much  lower  carbon  footprint,  comparing  to  PoW-based 

Ethereum 1.0.  

Projected Carbon Footprint of Blockchain Based on Logistic Model 

Predicting  the  carbon  footprint  of  blockchain  is  particularly  difficult  as  it  involves  order-of-

magnitude changes, and includes many assumptions. Here, we propose another method of logistic 

model, as  a supplement  to  the historic  adoption  model in  the Main  Text, to  predict  the carbon 

emissions from blockchain in the future. 

𝑃 =

𝐾 × 𝑃0
𝑃0 + (𝐾 − 𝑃0) × exp (−𝑟0 × 𝑡)

We try to estimate how many blockchain transactions would the world see today, if all financial 

transactions 𝐾 were covered by blockchain. The worldwide cashless transactions were 𝐾 = 779.1 

Billion times in  2020.  The transactions  on Bitcoin  were 112,559,843 times in  2020, which has 

increased from 31,332 times in 2009. We used the data of Bitcoin transactions in 2009 to 2020 to 

fit the logistic curve to obtain the initial growth rate 𝑟0 =  0.219 and the initial Bitcoin transaction 

number 𝑃0 = 9,714,478. The Bitcoin transaction number 𝑃 of year 𝑡 can be derived by Eq. 18. 

Note that the data source has been listed in the Data Sheet 4.1. It is perfectly plausible that all 

cashless transactions could become supported by blockchain technology, and the carbon emission 

under this condition  could  be assumed as an upper limit  from  blockchain.  We  assume that  the 

blockchain validation cost is proportional to the volume going through the system. 

If Bitcoin and Ethereum follow the growth by a logistic curve, the projected carbon emission is 

shown in Fig. S2 (See details in Data: Sheet 4.1-4.6). If PoW-based Ethereum were to follow the

logistic  growth  trend,  the  cumulative  CO2  emissions  of  this  blockchain  alone  could  warm  the 

planet  0.29  to  0.47  °C  by  2120,  shown  in  Fig. S2b.  Fig.  S2d  shows  the  total  cumulative  CO2 

emissions of PoW-based Ethereum and PoW-based Bitcoin crossing the 1.5 °C threshold within 

50  years.  Fig.  S2e  shows  the  carbon  emission  from  PoS-based  Ethereum  and  Bitcoin.  The 

temperature increase from PoS-based Ethereum and Bitcoin can be reduced to 0.18 ℃ to 0.29 ℃ 

in comparison to the 6.86 ℃ to 11.18℃ caused by PoW-based Ethereum and Bitcoin in 100 years. 

The logistic model predicts a very early adoption of blockchain technology. The adoption is larger 

than 95% in 50 years. Whereas the method of historically based adoption in the Main Text is only 

at  about  60%  in  50  years.  The  difference  is  because  blockchain  has  been  experiencing  a  fast 

exponential  growth  at  its  early  stage  shown  as  Fig  S1b,  and  the  rapid  growth  rate  will  be 

constrained by the limitations on resources shortly based on the logistic model when 𝑃0 = 𝐾. The 

exponential  growth  rate  of  blockchain  in  the  early  years  is  faster  than  the  median  curve  of  36 

widely adopted technology. 

The logistic model provides another way to predict the carbon emission from blockchain compared 

to the model of adoption of broadly used technologies. However, accurately predicting the future 

carbon emission of blockchain is a challenge. The energy consumption of blockchain is not limited 

to financial transfer, such as digital assets that might have to be recorded and preserved in a ledger 

on  blockchain.  Furthermore,  the  energy  consumption  of  blockchain  is  based  on  block  mining 

difficulty, but future block mining difficulty is hard to predict. In addition, the carbon emission 

from per unit of electricity might decrease with the wide adoption of renewable energy in the future. 

Our  model  also  does  not  consider  this  factor.  Our  study  concentrates  on  the  proposed  PoS 

mechanism that could reduce carbon emissions of blockchain by more than 97%.

Fig. S2 Projected Carbon Footprints of PoW and PoS-based Blockchain based on the logistic model. Fig. 

S2a shows trends in the adoption of blockchain technology based on the logistic model documented in Data: 

Sheet 4.1. b and c show the projected cumulative CO2 emissions and the resulting temperature rise from 

PoW-based Ethereum 1.0 and PoS-based Ethereum 2.0, respectively, if they were to follow the growth rate 

of the logistic model in a. We conduct an uncertainty analysis on the relationship between carbon emissions 

and the increase in global temperature. Purple right Y axis shows lower bound of uncertainty by carbon 

emission on temperature change, orange right Y axis shows the average value on temperature change, and 

green right Y axis shows the upper bound on temperature change. d and e show the projected cumulative 

CO2 emissions and the resulting temperature rise from PoW-based Ethereum 1.0 plus PoW-based Bitcoin, 

and PoS-based Ethereum 2.0 plus PoS-based Bitcoin, respectively, under the growth rate of the logistic 

model in a.  The Data is shown in Data: Sheets 4.1–4.6. 

Current trend of Ethereum and Bitcoin usage. 

Fig. S1. Current trend of a Ethereum and b Bitcoin usage. The use of Ethereum blockchain for 

decentralized finance, health care, Internet-of-Things (IOT) networks, video games and so on has 

a fast growth since its introduction in 2015, that is currently best described with an exponential 

model. Bitcoin also follows an exponential growth. The Data is shown in Data sheet: 5.1
