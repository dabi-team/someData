Abstract:  The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world and limited work/personal life activities.  Besides 
the loss of human lives and agony faced by humankind, the pandemic has badly hit differ before departure 
and on arrival,  and  voluntary quarantine,  were  enforced  to  limit  the  risk  of  trans-  mission.  However,  the 
hope for returning to a normal (pre-COVID) routine relies on the success of the current COVID vaccination 
drives  administered  by  different  countries.  To  open  for  tourism  and  other  necessary  travel,  a  need  is 
realized  for  a  universally  accessible  proof  of  COVID  vaccination,  allowing  travelers  to  cross  the  borders 
without any hindrance. This paper presents an architectural framework for a GDPR-compliant blockchain-
based COVID vaccination passport (VacciFi), whilst considering the relevant developments, especially in the 
European Union region.

1. Introduction 

Humankind is facing the challenges and agonies posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-
19) pandemic for more than a year [1].  Since its beginning, more than 130 million people have 
contracted this disease worldwide, and the number continues to grow daily [2].  The number  of 
people affected  by COVID-19, whether in the form of losing their loved ones, losing their jobs, 
abandoning  their  businesses,  is  far  greater  than  130  million  [3].  Among  the  many  industries 
affected by COVID-19, the travel and tourism industry got the biggest hit. Due to the pandemic 
nature of the disease, affected countries had to impose lockdown procedures to stop the spread 
of the virus [4]. Work has mostly shifted to remote means wherever possible, and the only ray of 
hope towards returning to normal life lies in the success of the vaccination drives. However, the 
vaccination of every individual in the world is going to take time [5,6]. 

To open the regions and to partially allow various sectors to revive, a need for vac- cination 
passports was realized. It is worthwhile to mention what we mean by a vaccine passport; it is a 
printed  or  digital  certificate  that  can  certify  that  a  person  is  unlikely  to  either  catch  or  spread 
disease. From the COVID-19 perspective, the proposed passport would certify that the holder has 
been vaccinated. However, such an implementation could also be used for certifying vaccination 
against other diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, measles, etc. 

Considering  the  COVID-19  perspective,  the  passport  could  allow  governments  to  relax 
restrictions, allowing vaccinated people to travel in planes, attend concerts and sports events, go 
to work, or dine  out, etc. Several governments in the world including  in Asia,  Europe, and the 
Middle East have plans of issuing such passports to vaccinated people to allow them to travel if 
desired without having to go through COVID-19 related traveling protocols. Specifically, in the EU 
region, the need for vaccine passports was realized from tourism-dependent southern countries. 
The EU commission has plans of having one such passport before the summer of 2021 to partially 
open the region for tourism [7,8].

When considering the development of such a passport, the requirements such as  integrity, 
verifiability,  traceability,  and  trust  by  design  are  considered  as  essentials.  With  such 
requirements,  there  are  two  technologies  as  candidates  for  consideration,  (1)  public  key 
infrastructure (PKI), and (2) blockchain. Each of these has its advantages and limitations. Using 
PKI would have meant that each health authority issues a vaccination certificate signed with the 
private  key  and  verifiable  using  a  public  key  at  the  border  controls.  The  limitations  of  such  a 
solution  include  (1)  issuance  of  a  new  certificate  after  administering  every  dose,  (2)  lack  of 
traceability by design, and (3) issuance of a new certificate in case of loss/deletion. Moreover, with 
PKI, a separate mechanism for the storage of the vaccination records by health authorities would 
be required, as the digital signatures hold good for authenticity and integrity purposes, and do 
not promise the ability to have tamper-proof records and transactions. However, blockchain aims 
to deliver these aspects by addressing trust issues while also enabling data integrity, availability, 
and  verifiability  [9].  Blockchain  uses  the  concept  of  decentralized  architecture  to  build  an 
interlinked chain of blocks. The block data is tamper-proof and can only be deleted by destroying 
the whole chain. Data inserted in the block is verified by the blockchain network’s participating 
authorities  using  specific  consensus  algorithms  [10].  The  use  of  blockchain  has  been  also 
suggested  for  solving  a  variety  of  issues  involving  the  healthcare  sector  [11],  therefore,  we 
considered  blockchain  for  the  development  of  COVID  vaccination  passports.  With  blockchain, 
issues such as the issuance of a new certificate after administering each dose, losing the certificate 
are  not  applicable  since  the  data  held  on  the  chain  itself  is  updated  and  therefore,  can  be 
verified.  Moreover, the  use  of  blockchain  also  enables  a  single  mechanism  for  verification  and 
storage  of  the  vaccination  record.  Furthermore,  blockchain  technology  is  used  in  different 
sectors  including,  identity  management  [12],  smart  homes  [13],  agriculture  [14],  power 
management [15], access control [16], and others. 

A  smart  contract  is  another  important  element  that  can  be  applied  with  blockchain  for 
verifiability, traceability, authentication, and ensuring trust. Smart contracts enable the automatic 
execution of instruction based on the fulfillment of certain conditions [17]. In this work, we are 
going  to  leverage  both  blockchain  and  smart  contracts  for  presenting  an  architectural 
framework for COVID vaccination passports. This vaccination passport will enable the concerned 
authority to verify the vaccination information of an individual anytime and anywhere. From the 
EU’s perspective, recommendations from General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) have been 
taken  into  consideration  while  formulating  the  architectural  framework  for  the  COVID 
vaccination passport.  We also referred to the existing literature and conducted interviews with 
the personnel from Finland’s blockchain industry for identification of the relevant protocols and 
mechanisms for the design of GDPR-compliant blockchain solutions [18,19]. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section2presents the background about 

blockchain technology, smart contracts, and GDPR; Section3outlines methodology for 
formulation of the proposed architectural framework; Section4presents the architec- tural 
framework for COVID vaccination passport and summarizes how it tackles the GDPR compliance 
issues related to the proposed architecture; Section5presents the research contributions and 
limitations, and Section6concludes the paper. 

2. Background 

In this section, we discuss some of the aspects related to blockchain technology imperative 
to be discussed before presenting the proposal for a vaccine passport. As stated earlier, we utilize 
smart contracts for the architectural framework. Therefore, we also discuss some details about 
smart contracts. 

2.1. Blockchain 

Blockchain  is  very  similar  to  a  database  or  ledger.  However,  it  is  more  advanced  and 
inherits the elements of security due to its cryptographic nature [20]. A decentralized network  is 
a  collection  of  many  centralized  networks  interconnected  in  a  distributed 

 
 
 
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6132 

3 of 14 

manner.  All  the  nodes  of  the  network  share  their  data  and  make  a  copy  of  the  whole  ledger. 
Blockchain  is  an  ever-growing,  interlinked  chain  of  blocks  that  stores  the  records  of  all  the 
transactions committed. Each block is linked to the next with the help of a cryptographic  hash 
value of the previous block. Besides hash value, the blocks also contain transaction data such as 
the timestamp. Blockchain makes it possible to  make transactions without any  intermediaries, 
thus  making  it  indeed  a  decentralized  technology.  It  also  uses  public-  key  or  asymmetric 
cryptography  and  consensus  algorithms  to  ensure  user  security  and  immutability  [21].  In 
Blockchain,  all  the  nodes  act  as  peers  and  they  are  treated  equally.  The nodes can share  data 
directly and do not need any centralized server to be able to send or receive. 

Blockchain is a reliable space to store and share data in a transparent manner. The path of 
the transaction can be checked or verified by the other nodes in the network. If any of the nodes 
think a transaction is risky, the node can cancel the transaction instantly [22]. There are mainly 
three types of blockchain, (1) permissionless blockchain, (2) private or permissioned blockchain, 
and (3) consortium blockchain. It is relevant to state that the architectural framework presented 
in this paper utilizes permissioned blockchain. 

(1)  Public Blockchain: A public blockchain is a non-restrictive, permission-less distributed ledger-
based system. Anybody having access to the Internet can register and sign in to the 
blockchain platform. Each member can check the transaction and verify it. Also, anyone can 
participate in the process of getting consensus. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the relevant 
examples [6]. A public blockchain also demands a significant amount of computing capacity, 
because maintaining a distributed ledger on a wide scale takes a significant amount of 
processing power. Each node in the network needs to solve a complicated cryptographic 
puzzle to verify that all nodes in the blockchain have coordinated to reach a consensus [7]. 

(3) 

(2)  Private Blockchain: It is restrictive in nature and requires permission, which limits it to work 
only for private networks. It has strict authorization management for accessing data. Only 
the selected participant has access to the system within an enterprise. Security, 
authorization, and accessibility are controlled by enterprises unlike public blockchain [9]. 
Private blockchains are easier to scale up, cut down costs, and feature greater transactions. 
This approach can enable the organization to have more control over the network and 
establish integrity by removing anonymity. 
Consortium  Blockchain:   This  is another type of  permissioned blockchain,   which    is also 
referred  to  as  a  semi-decentralized  blockchain.  In  this  type  of  blockchain,  predefined 
approved  parties  (nodes)  participate  in  the  block  validation  process.    If    a  group  of 
enterprises  wants  to  implement  a  blockchain  network  and  requires  only  a  few  approved 
parties  to  participate  in  the  process,  this  type  of  blockchain  plat-  form  can  be 
implemented.  Consortium  blockchain  allows 
implementation  of  customized 
organizational policies. In addition to these characteristics, depending on the requirements 
of  customers  (organizations),  services  of  the  blockchain  (i.e., 
inquiries  about  the 
information in the blockchain) can be open to the public or other authorities who are not 
part  of  the  blockchain.  The  proposed  architecture  is  based  on  elements  of  consortium 
blockchain  enabling  the  concerned  authorities  to  perform  the  needful  tasks  and  inquire 
about  any  information  residing  on  the  blockchain.  More-  over, the network can be easily 
expanded and if required, the participating authorities can be added  [23–25].  The factors 
which further motivate our choice of consortium blockchain are as follows: 
• 

It is a permissioned blockchain, therefore, only authorized nodes can validate the 
blocks. 
It is highly scalable allowing any party to get involved. 
Though it is a permissioned blockchain, its services can be seen by the public by using 
customized APIs. 
It allows spreading across a specific area or geographical region, allowing control over 
data transfer and processing.

• 

Potential data breaches can also be investigated easily since the participating 
authorities are fixed and finite. 

2.2. Smart Contracts 

A smart contract is an instruction set that automatically executes once certain user- defined 
conditions are  fulfilled.  Smart contracts have the benefit of allowing two distrusting  parties  to 
proceed with a transaction, without the need for a trusted third party such as  a lawyer or bank 
[26].  Fundamentally,  the  smart  contract  is  a  programmed  protocol  that  executes  based  on 
contract conditions and agreements.   If a smart contract is used in       a blockchain, it becomes 
immutable. For this reason, blockchain and smart contracts could be the right combination for 
ensuring trustworthiness and transparency since the use of blockchain can make smart contracts 
immutable as well as visible to the relevant stakeholders. In addition, the concept also preserves 
the  logical  connections  between  contractual  clauses  through  the  logical  flows  in  the  program. 
Smart  contract’s  life  cycles  can  be  separated  into  four  parts–creation,  deployment,  execution, 
and  completion.  This  cycle  continues  consecutively.  Smart  contracts  can  guarantee  proper 
access  control  and  contract  enforcement.  The  intended  statement  will  automatically  execute 
only when any condition of the smart contract is satisfied. An automatic penalty system might 
also be there if anyone breaches the contract [27,28]. 

The  proposed  architecture  is  based  on  smart  contracts  along  with  the  consortium 
blockchain.  A  smart  contract  can  also  be  used  for  consent  collection  [10].  Since  the  proposed 
architecture uses the hash of the personal data, the same can be used in the smart contract for 
consent collection purposes. The identifiable data is stored in the off-chain (traditional storage) 
so  that  there  will  be  no  issues  in  deleting  that  data  on  request.  No  personally  identifiable 
information will be stored on the blockchain. Instead, a hash of some  identifiers will be stored, 
which does not reveal any information about the data subject. 

Apart  from  the  above-mentioned  aspects,  the  smart  contract  provides  the  follow-  ing 

benefits.

• 

A  smart  contract  promotes  traceability  when  it  is  used  to  collect  the  status  of  the 
information on the blockchain. The transaction log of the smart contract can also be used 
as a travel log to trace and limit potential COVID exposures and infections. 
The  smart  contracts  execute  automatically  and  the  traveler  will  not  have  to  provide  any 
extra details for that. 
Verification with the help of a smart contract is faster than manual verification since it does 
not require human intervention. Moreover, there are no intermediaries involved. 

2.3. GDPR 

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is designed to protect the rights and freedom 
of European Union (EU) citizens. GDPR enables the protection and privacy of the personal data 
associated with EU  citizens.  The regulation  requires all the concerned parties  dealing  with  the 
personal data of EU citizens to comply with the GDPR [29].  The primary policy of GDPR is, the 
companies  must  inform  the  data  subjects  in  an  understandable  manner  about  the  data 
collection and usage procedures. The data subject possesses the ultimate power to give consent 
about  the  data  collection  and  deletion.  However  in  certain  circumstances  (falling  under  the 
purview  of  Article  6.1.e)  the  right  to  deletion  does  not  rest  with  the  data  subject,  but  the 
authority lies with the data controller 

The rapid growth of information and communication technologies is giving rise to the volume 
of personal data day by day. Healthcare, educational institutions, supply chain industry, and the 
agricultural  sectors  are  becoming  digitalized  with  time  and  hence  data  protection  and  privacy 
issues are going to be a critical concern [30,31]. 

The  proposed  vaccination  passport  is  intended  for  the  EU  region,  therefore,  GDPR 
compliance  issues  are  imperative  to  be  considered  [32,33].  Among  all  the  compliance  issues, 
data  deletion,  modification,  defining  the  controller  and  processor  are  the  most  crucial  ones. 
Moreover, we also analyzed existing literature that closely relates to the GDPR 

 
 
 
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6132 

5 of 14 

compliance  issues;  to  mention,  Al-Zaben  et  al.  [34]  proposed  an  off-chain  mechanism    for 
storing original data instead of storing it in the blockchain. Tatar  et al. [35] and  Bayle et al. [36] 
recommended  a  similar  approach  for  storing  personal  data  off-chain        for  compliance  with 
GDPR. 

Moreover,  with  blockchain  being  a  decentralized  network,  identification  of  the  data 
processor and controller is a crucial problem. GDPR explicitly identifies the data controller  and 
processor  because  it  creates  transparency.  Buocz  et  al.  [37]  recommend  miners  as  a  data 
controller,  but only the miners with significant financial leverage over the  network can be the 
controller.  The  financial  leverage  can  help  with  enforcing  policies  if  needed  throughout  the 
network.  Additionally,  Dutta  et  al.  [38]  and  Kondova  et  al.  [39]  proposed  the  use  of  a  joint 
controller. Dutta et al. [38] also proposed using miners as data processors in case of permissioned 
blockchain. Both the recommendations closely align with the proposed scheme. 

3. Methodology 
3.1. Identification of Design Requirements 

To formulate the architectural framework for the COVID vaccination passport, the first step 
was  to  identify  the  aspects  that  could  have  an  impact  on  the  design  of  COVID  vaccination 
passports.  To  identify  the  design  requirements,  we  collected  the  requirements  from  different 
sources and activities. 

(1) We  analyzed  the  two  existing  blockchain  solutions  deployed  for  verification  and 
integrity  checks  using  the  case  study  research  method  [40].  We  collected  technical  and 
marketing documentation of these blockchain solutions. One of the solutions is based on multi-
tenant  blockchain-based  proof  of  content  integrity  by  X  Group.  The  salient  feature  of  the 
proposed  solution  is  trust,  and  it  focuses  on  how  to  prove  the  stored  information,  or  its 
metadata  has  not  been  modified.  The  solution  is  based  on  storing  proof  of  integrity  onto  the 
blockchain. The solution is very much relevant to the context considered in this paper. However, 
the other solution which was analyzed is a  blockchain-based platform  for exchanging business 
documents in a machine-readable format. All transactions are validated to ensure high quality of 
data.  In  a  broader  perspective,  the  solution  assists  in  managing  the  supply  chain  while 
maintaining interoperability between different parties. The aspect of GDPR compliance was very 
important and how these issues have been tackled in the solution was of prime significance. 

(2)  We  collected  and  analyzed  data  from  expert  interviews  working  in  six  leading 
blockchain  companies  operating  in  Finland.  The  data  were  collected  using  semi-structured 
interviews.  The  average  length  of  the  interviews  was  approximately  1  h.  To    identify    how 
practitioners tackle the GDPR challenges in their use cases, the data from interviews was content 
analyzed utilizing qualitative coding [41]. Coding is a technique employed in qualitative research 
for analyzing data items to identify concepts and find a relation between the data items. There 
are different approaches to qualitative coding, however, the one used in this case is data-driven 
coding or open coding. 

(3) We have analyzed the data collected from 5 incoming travelers in Finland during this 
pandemic time.  The travelers are from outside the European Union.  They explained their 
experiences at the Helsinki Vantaa Airport and immigration. One of the travelers mentioned: “When I 
arrived at Helsinki Airport, I had to show my COVID negative certificate to 
the health authority at the airport in the arrival section. They were stationed with desks and chairs 
and tables. The health checking and verification is maintained by Finnish Institute for Health and 
Welfare.  The  booth  was  located  was  before  the  immigration  departure.  I  had  to  show  my 
identity documents as well as my COVID test report. After verifying my report with the QR code 
attached in my COVID report, I was instructed to do another COVID test after 72 h. If the result 
came negative, I could end my quarantine. After this station, there was no other verification at 
the immigration departure”. 

Another traveler who arrived a week later also experienced a similar situation. In addition, 

there is also COVID test-taking facilities at the airport, where one can get tested 

 
 
 
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6132

for COVID before entering Finland.  One of the  interviewed travelers did the COVID test at  the 
airport  since  her COVID  report  was  a  little  over  72  h.  The  Finnish  health  services inform  each 
traveler  that  if  anyone  does  not  want  to  get  tested  for  COVID  (second  time)  after  entering 
Finland, a 14-day quarantine is mandatory. If there is no sign of COVID infection, the quarantine 
can  end.  Interview  data  analysis  (using  open/inducting  coding)  epitomizes  a  few  common 
requirements,  for  example,  having  a  COVID  certificate  or  previous  COVID  history,  timestamp 
needed for the time of test along with a verification mechanism such as QR code embedded in the 
report. 

(4)  We  studied  and  identified  the  relevant  GDPR  articles  that  have  an  impact  on 

blockchain-based digital services. 

(5) We  have  also  analyzed  publicly  available  records  as  part  of  the  qualitative  research 
methodology for identifying the design requirements [42]. The sources of public records are the 
border  control  of  Finland  [43,44],  Sweden  [45],  and  Norway  [46].  In  addition,  we  studied the 
updates  on  COVID-specific  travel  requirements  on  the  EU  Commission’s  and  International  Air 
Transport Association (IATA) [47] and FinnAir [48] websites. More than one source was used to 
remove any kind of bias that might affect the requirements. We extracted the key requirements 
for  travel  guidelines  from  these  sources  and  considered  those  for  designing  the  proposed 
architecture. 

The  key  design  requirements  considered  while  formulating  the  architectural  frame-  work 

(identified after analyzing the data) are summarized as follows: 
1.The citizens must be registered with local health authorities to get vaccinated. 2.The 
vaccinations are administered in specific hospitals under specific protocols. 3.Timestamps 
would be required to record the date of vaccination to ensure validity.

3.2. GDPR Requirements 

For the system to be used for collecting and processing data of EU citizens, it needs to be 
GDPR-compliant.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  the  GDPR  and  blockchain,  the  articles  that  are 
discussed widely for compliance issues in terms of blockchain-based solutions are presented in 
Table1[ 49]. We identified the following three design principles for GDPR compliance. 

1. Access to data should be traced. 
2. Data subjects’ consent should be collected using a smart contract. 
3.Blockchain data needs to be deleted or modified upon request. 
4.Data controllers and processors must be identified. 

Next, we describe our proposed vaccination passport architecture that utilizes these 

identified design principles.

Table 1. Relevant General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) articles for blockchain-based solutions. 

Article No. 

Article 5 

Article 7 

Article 9 

Description 

This article states the “Principles relating to processing of personal data”. Some of the 

principles are “lawfulness, fairness and transparency”, “purpose limitation”, “data minimization”, 
“accuracy”, “ integrity and confidentiality” etc. 

The article demonstrates the data subjects’ consent collection and management related to data 
processing behaviour and techniques. The beginning of the article in the regulation is stated as “Where 
processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has 
consented to processing of his or her personal data.” 

The article demonstrates “processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political 
opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic 
data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health 
or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall 
be prohibited” 

Article 16 

“The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the 
rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her” 
In addition, the data subject’s right includes providing supplementary resources if it is needed based on 
the processing purpose. 

Article 17 

“The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data 
concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase 
personal data without undue delay” 
Data deletion causes can be consent withdrawal, no legitimate grounds for data retention, data storage 
not needed. Moreover, the data controller also has to make sure of the appropriate technical 
measures for deleting the personal data before displaying it. 

Article 18 

“The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing” under a 
few scenarios, for example, unlawful and illegitimate data processing, data storing is no longer 
required, etc. 

Article 24 

Article 25 

“Taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the risks of 
varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall 
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and to be able to 
demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall 
be reviewed and updated where necessary.” 

Data protection mechanisms should be embedded during the design stages of a system. A stated in the 
regulation “implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as pseudonymization, 
which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimization, in an effective 
manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements 
of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects” 
In addition to that, the controller must ensure the protection of personal data (collected and 
analyzed) by default. 

Article 26 

This article talks about the joint controller if needed in a system. The regulation says “Where two or 
more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint 
controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for 
compliance with the obligations under this Regulation,” 

Article 28 

This article specifies the data processor’s responsibility. The processor needs to perform the task 
lawfully and legitimately with appropriate measures. One of the sections of Article 28-GDPR 
states “Where the processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the 
controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate 
technical and organizational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements 
of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject” 
In addition, there are other regulations exists regarding the processing behavior and techniques of 
the processor 

4. Architectural Framework for COVID Vaccination Passport 
4.1. Architectural Framework (VacciFi) 

This section presents a proposal for a vaccination passport that is based on blockchain 

technology and inherits integrity by design. We have named the framework ‘VacciFi’. Such a 
passport aims to allow the regional authorities to verify the vaccination status of  a traveler. 
While considering the design requirements discussed earlier, the architectural framework 
presented in Figure1was formulated. The building blocks of the architectural framework include 
permissioned blockchain to allow certain actions to be performed only by certain identifiable 
actors. It also involves the use of smart contracts whenever some immigration authorities want 
to verify the vaccination details.

Figure 1. An architectural framework for VacciFi. 

Briefly,  the  framework  is  based  on  the  need  that  each  citizen  who  intends  to  have  a 
vaccination passport for traveling purposes has to register for the vaccine with their local health 
authority. Once the vaccine is administered, necessary details are recorded in the database (off-
chain). Each potential traveler is given a QR code stamped on the passport and electronically via 
registered email for verification purposes. Whenever required, the QR code can be scanned for 
verifying  vaccination  details  and  validity.    The  process  has      3  main  steps  discussed  in  the 
subsequent sub-sections. 

Furthermore,  one  important aspect to discuss when it comes to data storage on the off-
chain  systems  is  access  control  management.  For  the  VacciFi  framework,  we  propose  the 
following four operations for managing the access control: 
• 
Create: refers to the right for the creation of a new record in the off-chain 
• 
Read: refers to the right to read/view the record 
•  Update: refers to the right to update the existing record 
•  Delete: refers to deletion of the record 

Based on these operations, different authorities will have different access privileges, which 

are detailed in Table2.

As shown in the Table, the immigration authority has the right to read the existing records, 
however, the vaccination authority will have the ability to create, read and delete the records. 
The deletion capability is for off-chain storage, whenever such an operation is executed,  it will 
perform logical deletion of the data stored on the blockchain as well.  We discuss more details 
about this in Section4.2. 

4.1.1. Registration 

To save precious lives, different countries have  devised a vaccination policy consid- ering 
citizens more vulnerable to COVID. This policy mainly includes elder age groups, and vulnerable 
professionals such as healthcare workers and other frontline workers to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6132

be prioritized for vaccination. To get vaccinated the citizens have to be registered with the local 
health authority. This is the first step in the case of the proposed architectural framework. The 
registration can be done via different means, for example, online, using text messages, etc. After 
getting registered, the vaccination authority issues a vaccination ID, which has to be shared with 
the  hospital  staff  to  get  vaccinated.  When  the  user  receives  the  vaccination  ID,  the  consent 
conditions  shall  be  included  and  encoded  in  a  smart  con-  tract.  The  smart  contract  can  also 
include other  regulations, for example, the data  retention  period.  The vaccination data can be 
kept as long as required by the local health authorities. The retention time needs to be included in 
the smart contract. 

4.1.2. Vaccination 

While visiting the healthcare facility, the citizens are required to carry identity docu- ments 
such as a passport and vaccination ID. The front desk would record all the necessary information 
about the person getting vaccinated. For GDPR compliance purposes,  iden- tifiable information 
such as the traveler’s name, passport  number, contact details, etc. is stored off-chain. This will 
be supplemented by necessary access control mechanisms to ensure security. However, the data 
controller at the hospital stores two types of information onto the blockchain (1) the generated 
hash of the vaccination ID and passport number (2) the date of administering vaccination dose. 
As a result, a QR code is generated and pasted onto the passport and shared electronically with 
the traveler via email. 

4.1.3. Verification 

While traveling, the traveler presents the QR code to the immigration personnel. Scanning 
the  QR  code  would  retrieve  all  the  relevant  vaccination  details  along  with  the  hash  code 
generated during the vaccination phase from the local off-chain storage. The hash is then verified 
via smart contract by comparing with the one stored onto the permissioned blockchain. If there is 
a match, the blockchain returns dates of vaccination along with the  validity. The details  of the 
verification procedure are presented in Figure2. 

Figure 2. Description of the verification procedure. 

4.2. Compliance with GDPR 

The  proposed  architecture  uses  smart  contracts  for  accessing  vaccine  information.  The 

immigration authority and other concerned authorities will be able to retrieve the data 

 
 
 
 
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6132 

10 of 14 

by  invoking  smart  contracts.  From  the  GDPR  compliance  perspective,  both  the  user  and  the 
hospital authorities will be informed about this event, which shall give compliance to Article 5 of 
GDPR. It is to note that the same process has also been recommended in prior literature [33]. 

GDPR specifically emphasizes the data subject’s consent collection and its relationship with 
data analysis. This is crucial for the data controllers and processors. For compliance with GDPR, 
the  use  of  smart  contracts  can  be  useful.  The  proposed  architecture  includes  the  consent 
conditions that will be designed and encoded into smart contracts. When the vaccine receiver 
registers with the vaccination authority the consent will be collected. This technique shall make 
our proposed system compliant with article 7 of GDPR [50,51]. 

Furthermore, the data deletion and modification procedure that is “Right to be for- gotten” 
and  “Right  to  rectification”  of  GDPR  Articles  17  and  16,  respectively  have  to  be  considered. 
Whenever  the  vaccine  receiver  wants,  he  or  she  should  be  able  to  request    the  controller  for 
data deletion as well as data correction in case any wrong information is entered. This problem 
can  be  solved  by  using  off-chain  storage  for  original  data  and  on-chain  storage  for  proof  of 
existence  [35–37,41].  A  link  will  be  established  between  the  off-chain  and  on-chain  storage. 
Whenever user requests for data deletion, this connection link will be destroyed causing logical 
deletion. It is worthwhile to mention that in the case of the proposed architecture, the off-chain 
data  will  also  be  deleted  after  logical  deletion.  So,  there  will  be  no  personally  identifiable 
information  available  on  the  off-chain.  Besides,  blockchain  stores  the  hash  only  which  is 
irreversible and is not understandable at all. So, it is impossible to retrieve or understand personal 
information only by looking at the hash. 

Data  controller  and  processor  identification  (Articles  24,  26,  and  28)  is  another  vital 
requirement  for  blockchain-based  architectures.  There  are  several  recommendations  for  this 
purpose, for example, each node can act as a controller [37,38]. However, in some cases, miners 
with maximum financial stake can also act as controllers. If a smart contract is used in a system, 
smart contract developers can be also used as processors [39]. Since in the proposed architecture 
the permissioned blockchain is used, joint controllers (Article 26) could be used here. The miners 
who  will  be  validating  the  blocks  can  be  the  processors  (Article  28)  [39,52,53].  Therefore,  the 
proposed architecture is compliant with articles 26 and 28 of GDPR. 

Some characteristics of blockchain are inherently compliant with the GDPR. For exam- ple, 
blockchain complies with the GDPRs privacy by design since it uses a cryptographic approach by 
default  [54,55].  In  addition,  private  blockchain  helps  implement  security  measures  for  cross-
border data transmission. 

5. Discussion 
5.1. Research Contributions 

This paper represents an architectural framework of GDPR-compliant vaccination passport 
that can be designed on a consortium blockchain. This architecture promotes a trustworthy and 
seamless process for vaccination status verification at border control or in  any  other  required 
places. 

Scalability  is  another  crucial  advantage  of  the  proposed  architecture.  Since  the  ar- 
chitecture uses consortium blockchain, required authorities can be easily added to the network. 
The authorities can validate blocks using the Proof of Authority (POA) consen- sus algorithm. 

Consortium blockchain consumes less computing power since the nodes are prede- fined. 
Moreover,  the  proposed  solution  uses  POA,  which  also  does  not  need  a  large  amount  of 
computational  power.  Hence,  implementing  the  architecture  will  be  economical  in  terms  of 
computing power and installation cost. Besides other performance-related advantages, the POA 
consensus algorithm has advantages against 51% attack and distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attacks. In POA consensus, the 51% attack requires the attacker to gain control over 51% of the 
network’s nodes in contrast to others like proof of work consensus which requires control over 
51% of the computation power. It is worth noting that obtaining 

 
 
 
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 6132 

11 of 14 

control of the nodes in a permissioned blockchain network is much harder. The POA con- sensus 
algorithm  defends  against  DDoS  attacks  since  network  nodes  are  pre-authenticated  and  block 
generation  rights  can  be  granted  only  to  nodes  having  the  ability  to  withstand  the  denial-of-
service (DoS) attacks. In addition, in case of DoS attacks, the unavailable node can be removed 
from  the  network  so  that,  it  cannot  take  part  in  the  validation  process.  Furthermore,  the 
consortium blockchain helps alleviate anonymity. If there is any potential inside breach it can be 
detected very easily. 

The architecture can implement customized data privacy policies as well as organi- zational 
policies if needed. The participating nodes can decide among themselves how the network will 
operate, and the validation process will be done. Furthermore, the train- ing process for using 
the  network  and  validation  takes  less  time  since  the  number  of  stakeholders  actively 
participating in the process is limited. 

5.2. Limitations 

This  architecture  is  entirely  a  conceptual  framework  that  can  be  developed  with 
appropriate  technical  measures.  Considering  the  stakeholder  requirements 
in  various 
organizations, the components inside the architecture and interaction among them can change. 
Moreover,  real-time  testing  was  not  done,  and  the  development  phase  is  yet  to  be 
implemented. 

One  limitation  of  the  proposed  architecture  is  that  it  provides  a  mechanism  for  storing 
vaccination data, however, in line with the EU recommendations COVID passports should also be 
able to store negative COVID test results and recovery information from COVID in  case  of  the 
previous infection. 

Though the consortium blockchain uses pre-defined nodes for block validation, an in- sider 
attack  is  a  possibility.  If  any  node  acts  dishonestly  it  can  hamper  the  validation  process.  One 
probable  solution  can  be  removing  the  dishonest  nodes  immediately  upon  finding  out  the 
malicious activity. Identifying the attacker is relatively easy in this architecture since the level of 
anonymity is much lower. 

Another  limitation  is  related  to  the  GDPR’s  right  to  be  forgotten  policy.  This  is  an  issue 
related to the blockchain characteristics. Blockchain can act as an enabler of GDPR compliance, 
but  there  remains  an  argument  that,  as  the  data  cannot  be  deleted  from  blockchain,  it 
contradicts  Article  17.  We have  addressed  this  issue  here  by  storing  only  the hash of personal 
data  onto  the  blockchain.  Moreover,  the  architecture  performs  logical  deletion  and  the 
transactions  remaining  on  the  blockchain  cannot  identify  a  data  subject.  In  addition,  after  the 
logical deletion, original data is also deleted from the off-chain. 

6. Conclusions 

The  paper  presents  a  proposed  architecture  for  a  GDPR-compliant  COVID  vaccination 
passport (VacciFi). The architecture is scalable since the off-chain architecture is used for original 
data  storage.  The  system  shall  provide  availability,  traceability,  and  integrity  of  vaccination 
information.  VacciFi  uses  permissioned  blockchain,  which  will  enable  a  more  controlled 
environment for the participating authorities. The data controller and processors are identifiable, 
so the data subjects can trust the system. To summarize, the proposed architecture can facilitate 
a  secure,  verifiable,  and  trustworthy  environment  that  can  be  acclimatized  with  the  current 
pandemic  situation  for  ensuring  safe  travel  and  business  across  the  border.  Considering  the 
limitations in the architecture, future work intends to (1) develop a proof of concept based on the 
proposed  architecture;  for  this  purpose  we  intend  to  collaborate  with  partner  companies  for 
development and testing as such; and (2) to scale up VacciFi for recording other COVID-specific 
details, as identified above and also for recording other vaccinations such as for polio, measles, 
etc.  Such  an  implementation  could  be  very  helpful  in  tracking  and  verifying  vaccinations 
worldwide post-pandemic.
