Abstract—Blockchain is one of the most discussed and highly 
accepted  technologies,  primarily  due  to  its  application  in  almost 
every  field  where  third  parties  are  needed  for  trust.  Blockchain 
technology  relies  on  distributed  consensus  for  trust,  which  is 
accomplished using hash functions and public-key cryptography. 
Most of the cryptographic algorithms in use today are vulnerable 
to  quantum  attacks.  In  this work,  a  systematic literature review 
is  done  so  that  it  can  be  repeated,  starting  with  identifying  the 
research  questions.  Focusing  on  these  research  questions, 
literature is analysed to find the answers to these questions. The 
survey  is  completed  by  answering  the  research  questions  and 
identification  of  the  research  gaps.  It  is  found  in  the  literature 
that  30%  of  the  research  solutions  are  applicable  for  the  data 
layer,  24%  for  the  application  and  presentation  layer,  23%  for 
the network layer, 16% for the consensus layer and only 1% for 
hardware and infrastructure layer. We also found that 6% of the 
solutions  are  not  blockchain-based  but  present  different 
distributed ledger technology. 

Keywords—Blockchain; quantum computers; distributed ledger 
technology; security; systematic literature review; quantum attacks 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Quantum  computing  is  one  of  the  latest  technologies  that 
has  exploded  in  popularity  in  recent  years.  While  the 
foundation  of  quantum  mechanics  has  been  more  theoretical 
than  practical  for  over  100  years,  now  the  time  has  arrived 
when practically all firms are delving into it. In the late 1970s 
and  early  1980s,  research  defining  the  fundamentals  of 
quantum  computing  surfaced.  Paul  Benioff,  an  Argonne 
National Labs scientist, wrote a paper in 1979 that showed the 
theoretical  foundation  for  quantum  computing  [1]  and 
suggested  that  a  quantum  computer  might  be  developed. 
to  be  developing  quantum 
Numerous  businesses  claim 
computers,  such  as  IBM,  which  is  currently  providing  its 
clients with the first solutions in the form of a Quantum Gate 
Model.  Google,  Microsoft  and  many  other  companies  are 
exploring similar machines. 

Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the decentralised transfer and 
maintenance  of  digital  assets  that  cannot  be  duplicated  [2]. 
Distributed  ledger  technology  (DLT)  was  initially  used  in 
finance,  but  it  was  subsequently  discovered  that  it  could  be 
used  whenever  we  desire  to  eradicate  centralisation  or 
intermediaries.  The  most  widely  used  DLT  is  blockchain. 
There  are  other  types  of  DLTs  like  IOTA  [3],  Hashgraph  [4] 
etc., which are based on Directed Acyclic Graphs. Radix is also 
a DLT that uses a distributed database to store transactions [5]. 
Blockchain may be conceived as a sequence of interconnected 
blocks containing transactions. Every block stores the hash of 
the previous block, which results in a chain that is very difficult 

to  modify  since  modifying  every  transaction  necessitates 
modifying  the  block,  and  modifying  the  block  necessitates 
modifying  the  entire  chain.  Blockchain  is  the  foundation  of 
cryptocurrencies  such  as  Bitcoin  [2],  Ethereum  [6],  Litecoin, 
etc. 

Quantum  computers  cannot  solve  optimisation  issues  in  a 
substantially  scalable  manner.  In  a  universal  infrastructure, 
there will be classical computers and quantum computers, with 
the  quantum  computer  having  a  significant  edge  in  terms  of 
optimisation.  Several  quantum  algorithms,  such  as  Grover's 
algorithm [7], Shor's algorithm [8], and others, can solve some 
problems  far  quicker  than  conventional  algorithms.  Problems 
that  have  previously  been  almost  insolvable  will  now  be 
resolved in a reasonable period. In this regard, advancement in 
the quantum computing sector has piqued the curiosity of many 
researchers in both academia and industry. 

Blockchain technology started to proliferate because of its 
nature to provide unbreakable data security, but once practical 
quantum  computers  are  developed,  they  cannot  provide  such 
security  [9].  Smart  contracts  can  be  hampered,  and  the  whole 
technology  will  go  down.  The  security  of  the  blockchain  is 
built  on  mathematical  challenges  that  are  extremely  difficult 
for even the most powerful conventional computers to solve. 

Public  key  cryptography  protects  cryptocurrencies.  To 
breach  public  key  encryption,  quantum  computers  might 
possibly  threaten  the  crypto  industry,  where  some  currencies 
are  worth  trillion  of  dollars.  Encryption  can  be  bypassed, 
allowing attackers to mimic legal owners of digital assets. All 
security assurances will be meaningless if quantum computing 
gets  strong  enough.  To  decrypt  data,  quantum  computers  will 
need  thousands  of  qubits,  compared  to  today's  hundreds. 
Machines  will  also  require  persistent  qubits  that  can  do 
calculations for much longer than currently achievable. 

NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) has 
already  started  finding,  evaluating,  and  standardising  public-
key  cryptography  algorithms  that  are  quantum-resistant  [10]. 
However,  it  is  necessary  for  the  research  community  to 
primarily  focus  on  blockchain  technology.  A  lot  of  work  is 
going  on 
to  create  a  quantum  secure  blockchain.  To 
systematically  analyse  them  following  research  questions  are 
set: 

RQ1: What challenges and security issues could occur due 

to the rise of quantum computers in blockchain technology? 

RQ2: What are the various strategies and approaches used 

by researchers to make blockchain quantum resistant?

Vol. 13, No. 1, 2022 

To answer these research questions, a systematic literature 
review has been undertaken. In Section 2, the research method 
is  discussed  in  detail.  Section  3  explores  the  basics  of 
blockchain and quantum computing and the related challenges 
and  solutions  associated  with  these  technologies.  The  survey 
results  and  answers  to  the  research  questions  are  discussed  in 
Section  4,  and  the  work  is  then  concluded  in  Section  5  with 
future directions. 

II.  RESEARCH METHOD 
This  research  utilised  the  SLR  (Systematic  Literature 
Review) method, as it helps to conduct the secondary research 
using  a  well-defined  method.  This  approach  gives  us  a 
framework to follow in order to discover, analyse, and evaluate 
relevant literature to find unbiased and reproducible answers to 
our  research  questions  [11].  The  parts  of  the  process  include 
planning,  conducting  and  reporting  on  the  review.  Section  1 
deals  with  the  planning  phase.  Reporting  is  handled  in 
Sections 3  and  4.  This  section  goes  through  the  phases  of  the 
review process, which includes: 

A.  Research Identification 

This  preliminary  search  aims 

to  discover  existing 
systematic  reviews  and  determine  the  volume  of  studies  that 
would be appropriate. A single search string is utilised instead 
of many search strings. Only databases related to the issue and 
widely accepted in the scholarly community are included. For 
this  study,  only  IEEE  Xplore,  Elsevier,  ACM  Digital  library, 
Springer Nature and Taylor & Francis is used. 

The  search  string  is  formed  to  search  throughout  the 
metadata  using  the  Boolean  operator  "AND,"  and  the  simple 
search term is ("Blockchain" AND "Quantum"). 

B.  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 

Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  should  be  based  on  the 
research questions to guarantee that the research questions can 
be  effectively  interpreted  and  that  the  studies  are  properly 
classified.  Because  the  wide  usage  of  blockchain  grew  in 
prominence  after  2015,  we  chose  all  papers  published  after 
January  2016.  We  also  limited  the  results  to  journal  and 
conference  articles,  excluding  online  material,  books,  and 
magazines. If duplicate articles or corrections are found in any 
of  these  articles,  they  were  removed.  Finally,  only  articles 
written entirely in the English language are chosen. 

C.  Study Selection Process 

We found 126 items in IEEE Xplore, 395 in Elsevier, 187 
in the ACM digital library, 272 in Springer Nature, and 96 in 
Taylor  &  Francis  Online  using  the  specified  search  term  and 
inclusion-exclusion  criteria.  A  three-stage  selection  technique 
was  implemented  to  guarantee  that  only  relevant  research 
articles  were  evaluated.  Following  the  search,  the  results  are 
extracted  using  keywords  and  titles.  Following  that,  the 
abstracts  of  the  papers  were  read,  and  the  number  of  articles 
was  decreased.  Only  high-quality  studies  that  answered  the 
research questions were picked in the last step, which involved 
reading whole articles and ranking them based on content. For 
efficient monitoring and control during the selection process, a 
separate  folder  was  created  for  each  evaluation  stage,  along 
with a new Excel sheet. The research is entirely transparent and 

traceable  as  a  result  of  this.  Table  I  shows  the  step-by-step 
selection  criteria,  and  Fig.  1  shows  the  count  of  publications 
that were included.

the  data  from 
depending  on  the  research  questions.  The  problems  are  not 
clearly  defined  but  presented  as  an  overall  solution  to 
blockchain  problems  with  quantum  computing.  In  order  to 
categorise them properly, the solutions provided are split based 
on  different  layers  of  blockchain.  Every  layer  has  different 
security  requirements,  so  based  on  these  layers,  research 
articles are grouped. Also, some solutions are working of more 
than  one  layer,  so  these  solutions  are  identified  separately  for 
each  layer.  First,  we  explain  the  problems  in  each  layer  and 
then different types of solutions studied in the literature. 

A.  Challenges and Issues 

After  the  analysis,  it  is  decided  to  represent  blockchain  in 
layers  as  shown  in  Fig.  2  and  then  understand  the  issues 
according  to  each  layer.  Dividing  into  layers  make  it  easy  to 
understand where research is still required. These layers, along 
with problems, are explained below: 

1)  Hardware  and  infrastructure  layer:  Internet  users 
(peers)  can  now  connect  with  other  peers  and  share  data  as 
distributed systems are becoming more prevalent. This layer is 
responsible  for  creating  virtual  resources  such  as  storage, 
networks,  and  servers.  Nodes  are  the  essential  part  of  this 
layer because nodes are hardware devices that connect to the 
the  blockchain. 
network  and  help  make  consensus 
Infrastructure  security  frequently  necessitates  either  limiting 
or prohibiting access to the node. So, improvement is needed 
at  the  infrastructure  level  to  implement  quantum  blockchain 
properly. 

in 

2)  Data  layer:  Data  stored  in  blockchain  depends  on  the 
type of blockchain-like Hyperledger Fabric [12] that contains 
channel  information,  whereas  a  Bitcoin  blockchain  needs  to 
store  the  information about  the  sender,  receiver,  and  amount. 
Blockchain  network  data  is  added  only  when  consensus  is 
reached  among  the  nodes.  Hash  functions  help  in  the  easy 
identification of blocks and the detection of any changes made 
to the blocks. To ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the 
data stored on the blockchain, transactions are digitally signed. 
Blockchain  uses  asymmetric  cryptography 
secure 
information  about  the  block,  transactions,  and  transacting 
parties, among other things. 

to 

To  sign  a  transaction,  private  keys  are  used,  and  anyone 
with the public key is used, and anyone with the public key can 
verify  the  signer.  Because  the  encrypted  data  is  also  signed, 
digital  signatures  ensure  data  integrity.  Every  transaction  in  a 
block is hashed and organised in the form of a Merkle tree. In 
the Merkle tree hash of transactions are organised in the form 
of a binary tree. If any transaction is changed, then the whole 
Merkle tree is changed, which changes the whole block as the 
block contains the hash of the Merkle tree.

third  party  is  missing  to  validate  transactions  in  case  of 
conflict. The consensus layer is the most significant layer for 
any  blockchain.  Consensus  protocols  provide  a  set  of 
irrefutable agreements between nodes in a distributed peer-to-
peer  network.  Consensus  keeps  all  of  the  nodes  in  sync. 
Consensus  is  in  charge  of  validating  the  blocks,  ordering 
them,  and  guaranteeing  that  everyone  agrees.  It  is  easy  to 
attack  this  layer  with  the  help  of  quantum  computers. 
Attackers can search hash collisions, which can subsequently 
be used to change blocks in a network without impacting the 
integrity of the blockchain. Also, for mining, it is required to 
search  a  nonce,  and  with  quantum  computers,  it  will  be  very 
fast.  This  can  enable  an  attacker  to  reconstruct  the  whole 
blockchain without getting detected by the network. 

5)  Application layer: The application layer includes smart 
contracts[16], chaincode[12], and decentralised apps (dApps). 
Smart  contracts  are  digital  contracts  built  on  the  blockchain 
that is automatically executed when particular events occur, or 
any  external  criterion  are  met.  Chaincode  is  a  collection  of 
related smart contracts used to do a certain purpose. dApps are 
software  applications  that  run  on  a  blockchain  network  of 
computers  rather  than  on  a  single  device.  Because  they  are 
decentralised,  decentralised  apps  are  free  of  the  control  and 
influence of a single authority. 

independence  and 

dApps provide several advantages, including user privacy, 
developer 
lack  of  censorship.  The 
application  layer  comprises  two  layers:  the  application  layer 
and  the  execution  layer.  The  application  layer  is  where  end-
users  interact  with  the  blockchain  network,  including  scripts, 
APIs, user interfaces, and frameworks. 

The  execution  layer,  which  includes  smart  contracts, 
underlying  rules,  and  chaincode,  is  a  sublayer.  This  sublayer 
contains  the  code  and  rules  that  are  actually  executed.  A 
transaction is propagated from the application to the execution 
layer,  but  it  is  validated  and  executed  by  the  semantic  layer. 
The  execution  layer  processes  transactions  and  preserves  the 
blockchain's deterministic nature. It receives instructions from 
the  application  layer.  A  smart  contract  code  should  not  be 
pulled down or changed after being deployed on a blockchain, 
but  it  may  be  possible  with  quantum  computers.  Similarly, 
instead of making the smart contract more complex within the 
same  technology,  it  is  necessary  that  from  now  on,  those 
researchers  should  start  moving  towards  quantum-resistant 
smart contracts. 

B.  Solutions 

First,  the  basic  concepts  of  quantum  computing  and  some 
of  the  properties  are  discussed  in  this  section.  After  that,  the 
explanation of the solutions and methods that are found in the 
literature are discussed. 

Quantum  computing  focuses  on  developing computer 
systems using  quantum  theory  and  quantum  bits,  or  qubits. 
Quantum computers use subatomic particles' ability to exist in 
many  states,  i.e.,  it  can  be  0  or  1  simultaneously.  Algorithms 
work  by  manipulating  bits  with  gates,  which  change  their 
states.  The  NAND  gate  is  a  universal  gate,  but  the  NAND 
gate's behaviour is not reversible because it accepts two inputs 

Fig. 2.  Different Layers of the Blockchain. 

As  a  result,  any  manipulation  will  render  the  signature 
invalid.  Most  blockchain  systems  depend  significantly  on  a 
digital signature to improve security. These signatures rely on 
the  difficulty  of  solving  a  mathematical  problem,  such  as 
determining  the  factors  of  large  integers.  The  data  layer  is 
highly  dependent  on  these  algorithms,  and  once  practical 
quantum  computers  are  developed,  breaking  these  algorithms 
will  be  easy.  As  a  result,  this  layer  is  too  much vulnerable  to 
quantum attacks. 

3)  Network layer: The network layer is in charge of inter-
node  communication  and  handles  block  propagation, 
transactions,  and  discovery.  It  is  also  called  the  propagation 
layer  or  peer  to  peer  layer.  In  a  peer-to-peer  network,  nodes 
share the workload to achieve a common goal in a distributed 
network.  This  layer  ensures  that  nodes  can  discover  other 
nodes  in  the  network  to  interact,  propagate,  and  synchronise 
information  with  other  nodes.  This  layer  also  handles  the 
propagation of the world state. A node can be a light node or a 
full  node.  Light  nodes  can  merely  retain  the  blockchain's 
header  and  send  transactions.  Full  nodes  are  responsible  for 
transaction verification and validation, mining, and consensus 
rule enforcement. They are in charge of ensuring the network's 
trustworthiness.  So,  it  is  needed  that  this  layer  uses  quantum 
network in the future. 

The term "Quantum Internet" [13]–[15] refers to the entire 
system,  which  comprises  both  quantum  and  classical  packet 
switching networks. A traditional network in which hosts and 
routers  can  handle  quantum  information  in the  network graph 
structure  is  known  as  a  quantum  network.  Between  these 
nodes, there are classical channel for transferring classical data 
and  quantum  channel  connections  for  transmitting  quantum 
data. 

4)  Consensus layer: The rules that nodes follow to ensure 
that  transactions  are  validated  within  those  rules,  and  that 
blocks  respect  those  rules  is  known  as  consensus.  There  is  a 
consensus  algorithm  behind  every  blockchain  as  the  trusted

and returns outputs that are not unique. In quantum computing, 
working  with  reversible  gates  is  typically  convenient  since 
every  reversible  gate  may  be  implemented  on  a  quantum 
computer. The Toffoli gate is a reversible gate that takes three

a 
mathematical  object  that  offers  a  probability  distribution  for 
each potential measurement of a system's outcomes. When we 
combine  quantum  states,  we  get  another  quantum  state.  Pure 
quantum  states  cannot  be  expressed  as  a  mixture  of  other 
states,  whereas  mixed  quantum  states  can  be  described  as  a 
combination  of  other  states.  Quantum  computing  performs 
computations  by  utilising  the  collective  characteristics  of 
quantum  states,  such  as  superposition,  collapse,  and 
entanglement.

be characterised. When two qubits become entangled, a one-of-

demonstrated by measurements, which may produce a value of 
0 or 1 for individual qubits where the measurement of both the 
qubits will be the same.  Even if the particles are separated by a

information. Quantum channels are trace-preserving mappings 
between  spaces  of  fully  positive  operators.  In  other  words,  a 
quantum  channel  is  just  a  quantum  operation  considered  as  a 
pipeline  meant  to  transmit  quantum  information  rather  than 
simply  the  reduced  dynamics  of  a  system.  Some  solutions,  as 
discussed in [18], [65] are based on quantum channels. 

The  idea  of  quantum  key  distribution  (QKD)  was  initially 
presented  in  the  1970s,  but  it  was  not  fully  realised  until  the 
1980s.  QKD  allows  to  sharing  and  distribute  secret  keys  for 
cryptographic  protocols.  The  essential  thing  is  to  keep  them 
private,  just  between  the  communicating  parties.  Quantum 
superpositions  or  quantum  entanglement  and  conveying 
information  in  quantum  states  may  be  used  to  develop  a 
communication system that detects eavesdropping. If the extent 
of  eavesdropping  is  less  than  a  certain  threshold,  only  then  a 

secure  key  can  be  generated  otherwise,  the  communication  is 
terminated.  This 
the  general  concept  of  Quantum 
cryptography that is why it is added as a property. Authors in 
[18], [19], [21], [26], [31], [41], [46], [70] discussed the usage 
of QKD for quantum blockchain.

signature 

2)  Hash-based  signature:  The  hash-based  signature  is 
used to utilise the cryptographic safe hash function properties. 
These  properties  include  pre-image  resistance,  one-wayness 
and  collision  resistance.  Hash-based  signature  systems  rely 
entirely  on  the  underlying  safe  cryptographic  hash  function, 
limiting  the  attack  surface  and  cryptanalysis  possibilities.  By 
removing  the  need  for  several  security  components,  hash-
based 
minimise 
implementation complexity. Any hash function that meets the 
security  criteria  of  cryptographic  hash  functions  can  be 
employed  to  build  hash-based  signature  algorithms.  Because 
of  this  inherent  flexibility,  several  underlying  hash  functions 
may  be  used  to  meet  the  required  performance  requirements 
based  on  the  application-specific  environment.  Any  difficult-
to-invert  function  may  be  converted  into  a  secure  public-key 
signature  system  using  hash-based  cryptography.  As  a  result, 
this  might  be  a  solution  for  post-quantum  blockchains  as 
discussed in [24], [32], [50], [71].

3)  Code-based 

cryptography:  All 

cryptosystems, 
symmetric or asymmetric, whose security is based, in part or 
entirely,  on  the  difficulties  of  decoding  a  linear  error-
correcting code, perhaps chosen with some particular structure 
or  in  a  particular  family  (for  instance,  quasi-cyclic  codes,  or 
Goppa codes) is code-based cryptography [72]. The ciphertext 
is  a  codeword  with  flaws  that  can  only  be  corrected  by  the 
owner's private key (the Goppa code). Grover's algorithm does 
not  significantly  outperform  earlier  code-based  cryptosystem 
attacks in terms of speed.

that the cryptographic framework is free of fundamental flaws.

5)  Multivariate cryptography: A set of (usually) quadratic 
polynomials  over  a  finite  field  is  a  public  map  for  a 
multivariate  public-key  cryptosystem  (MPKC)  [74].  In 
general,  finding  a  solution  to  such  structures  is  an  NP-
complete/-hard  problem  [75].  One  of  the  intriguing  instances 
is Patarin's Secret Fields [76], which generalises a suggestion 
by  Matsumoto  and  Imai  [77].  The  NP-hardness  of  solving

influential  families  of  PKCs  (public-key  cryptography),  as  it 
can withstand even the most powerful quantum computers in 
the  future.  The  MQPKC,  unlike  many  other  forms  of  PKC, 
cannot  be  solved  quickly  using  Shor's  algorithm  with  a 
conventional computer because it does not rely on any of the 
difficulties that Shor's algorithms can resolve. 

is  an  alternative 

6)  Directed  acyclic  graph:  A  distributed 

ledger 
technology,  a  DAG  [66], 
to  regular 
blockchain that seeks to solve blockchain technology's speed, 
scalability, and cost concerns. DAG is also a system that uses 
a  digital  ledger  to  keep  track  of  transactions.  DAG  (Directed 
Acyclic  Graph)  is  a  more  expressive  outline  than  an  entirely 
linear  model.  A  DAG  is  a  data  or  information  structure  that 
may  be  used  to  show  a  variety  of  difficulties.  It  is  a 
topologically  ordered  acyclic  graph.  The  node  follows  a 
specific  sequence  for  each  directed  edge.  Every  DAG  begins 
with a node with no parents and ends without children. There 
are no cyclic graphs on this page. A DAG is made up of nodes 
and  arrows  that  connect  them.  By  allowing  many  chains  to 
exist on the system simultaneously, DAG can solve the single-
chain problem of blockchain. IOTA is a DAG currency that is 
quite  well-known.  DAG  Tangle  is  what  they  call  it.  It 
eliminates  the  need  for  miners  in  the  verification  process 
entirely.  The  white  paper  published  by  IOTA  claims  that 
Tangle is quantum-proof [3]. 

7)  Quantum blind signature: A blind signature is a digital 
signature  that  blinds  the  message  before  it  is  signed.  As  a 
result,  the  message  will  go  undetected  by  the  signer.  After 
that,  the  signed  message  will  be  unblinded.  It  functions  as  a 
standard  digital  signature  and  can  be  publicly  verified.  Blind 
signatures that can survive quantum attacks are referred to as 
"post-quantum  blind  signatures."  Blind  signatures  have  been 
widely used in the applications like the creation of e-cash and 
voting  agreements.  As  a  result,  new  quantum  blind  signature 
technologies  will  be  necessary  for  the  future.  This  solution 
works  with  other  solutions  like  lattice-based  or  multivariate 
cryptography in order to provide quantum-resistant blockchain 
[18], [19], [39], [42], [54], [55]. 

8)  Quantum walks: A random walk is a random process in 
mathematical space that defines a path consisting of a series of 
random  steps,  as  defined  by  Pearson  in  1905  [78].  Random 
walks are essential in solving practical issues since they can be 
used  to  evaluate  and  mimic  the  unpredictability  of  items  and 
determine the correlation between them. Quantum walks were 
introduced  in  1993  [79].  The  polar  opposite  of  traditional 
random  walks is  quantum  walks. Quantum  walks  differ  from 
regular  random  walks  in  that  they  do  not  converge  to  any 
limiting distributions and are much faster because of Quantum 
interference[79]–[81].  Quantum  walks  can  outperform  any 
traditional algorithm by order of magnitude. The two types of 
quantum  walk-based  algorithms  are  continuous  time-based 
and discrete time-based algorithms [82]. 

9)  Hardware  and  software  based  blockchain:  As  shown, 
blockchain  implementation  may  be  implemented  into  many 
different technology stack layers. So, hardware-based security 
is  also  essential. It  may  involve  hardware-based  secure  key 
storage  or  hardware  replacement  for  quantum  channels. 
Hardware-based  key  storage  is  already  being  developed  as 
cold wallets, but it must also be quantum secure. The authors 
in [48] develop a quantum computing device as a multi-input 
multi-output quantum channel. 

10) Quantum  cloud  computing:  In  a  cloud  computing 
environment,  a  cloud  quantum  computer  is  a  computer  that 
can be accessed over the internet. Users may now make use of 
a  variety  of  cloud  quantum  computing  services  to  solve 
complicated issues that demand a lot of computational power. 
The  design  and  performance  of  different  cloud  quantum 
computing  systems  vary.  Solutions  discussed  in  [17],  [48] 
used quantum cloud computing. 

11) Post-quantum threshold signature: Threshold signature 
[83] is a unique digital signature that can be used to identify a 
group  of users.  It  is generated by  an  authorised  subset  of the 
private keys. The public keys are already generated with these 
private keys. It is very easy to verify these signatures as only a 
single public key and a single signature is enough. If at least n 
users  out  of  m  users  efficiently  sign  the  message,  then  the 
system is known as (n, m) threshold. The solution discussed in 
[29]  is  based  on  solving  quadratic  equations  in  a  finite  field, 
an  NP-hard  problem.  This  system  is  a  threshold  signature 
system  and  is  considered  safe  even  after  developing  a 
powerful quantum computer. 

In  a 

12) Quantum  random  oracle  model: 

random 
oracle[84],  anyone  may  give  it  an  input  and  output  of  fixed 
length. If someone has already requested the input, the oracle 
will provide the identical result. If the oracle receives an input 
that  it  has  not  seen  before,  it  generates  a  random  output.  To 
make the whole system secure, it is needed to replace all the 
hash  functions  used  in  the  system  with  random  oracles. 
Traditional  oracle  models  can  be  easily  attacked  by  using 
quantum superposition. This may result in the failure of many 
classical security  proofs  and  must  be  rewritten.  Quantum 
random oracle along with lattice-based solutions are discussed 
in [43]. 

13) One  way  function:  A  one-way  function  is  easy  to 
compute  on  all  inputs  but  complex  to  invert  given  the  image 
of  a  random  input.  In  many  cryptographic  systems,  one-way 
functions  have  proven  useful  primitive.  Extensive  work  on 
one-way  quantum  functions  has  also  been  done  in  the  post-
quantum  period.  These  one-way  functions  accept  outputs  of 
the  quantum  states  by  taking  classical  bit  strings  as  input. 
Many 
information-theoretically  secured  digital  signature 
techniques  rely  on  the  one-wayness  characteristic  of  these 
functions [85], [86] have been proposed. To authenticate both 
classical  bit  strings  and  quantum  states,  these  one-way 
functions  should  be  both  quantum-classical  and  classical-
quantum  in  design.  As  a  result,  [60]  developed  quantum

money systems based exclusively on the security of one-way 
functions that are resistant to quantum attacks. 

14) Zero-knowledge proof: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) 
enable  data  to  be  validated  without  disclosing  the  data  itself. 
As a result, they have the potential to transform the way data 
is gathered, used, and transacted. Each transaction is assigned 
a  'verifier'  and  a  'prover'.  In  a  ZKPs  transaction,  the  prover 
tries  to  prove  something  to  the  verifier  without  revealing 
anything about it. The authors of [47] suggest employing two 
indistinguishable 
with 
ZKPs protocols to ensure security against quantum attacks.

IV.  RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
Blockchain  is  an  up-and-coming  technology,  and  it  is 
assumed  that  it  is  the  foundation  of  web  3.0.  Quantum 
computing is not just theoretical now, as can be seen with the 
development  of  quantum  computers  by  google  (72  qubits), 
Xanadu  (24  qubits),  IBM  (127  qubits),  Intel  (49  qubits)  etc. 
Quantum Computers are real threats to blockchain technology, 
as  discussed  in  the  article.  Our  literature  review  found  that  to 
make  blockchain  stable  even  with  quantum  computers,  work 
must be done at all the layers of blockchain, not just one layer. 
By 
that,  we  can  genuinely  make  a  quantum-resistant 
blockchain. 

The  focus  was  mainly  on  the  research  questions  in  the 
survey,  and  both  the  research  questions  were  answered.  The 
security  threats  on  the  blockchain  are  divided  based  on  the 
layers  of  the  blockchain  and  based  on  that  we  analysed  the 
papers. As shown in Fig 3, most of the work (i.e., 30%) mainly 
focused on the data layer, which seems likely because mainly 
encryption and transactions are handled in this layer. The next 
area  of  focus  was  the  application  and  presentation  layer,  with 
24% of articles has shown the work on that. This layer includes 
applications  based  on  blockchain,  which  may  include  smart 
contracts or chain codes. Therefore, the security of this layer is 
essential;  however,  the  focus  of  the  articles  found  concerning 
specific  applications,  so  the  focus  should  be  on  general 
solutions as well. For the network layer, it is found that 23% of 
papers  work  to  find  secure  quantum  networking  and  16%  of 
the  articles  found  work  on  either  changing  the  consensus 
algorithm or proposing the new algorithm in itself. Only 1% of 
articles  discussed  infrastructure  and  6%  about  working  with 
distributed  ledger  other  than  blockchain  like  IOTA,  which  is 
based on the directed acyclic graph. 

Next,  we  aimed  to  categorise  solutions  based  on  four 
categories  only, 
i.e.  Hash-based  signatures,  Code-based 
cryptography,  lattice-based  cryptography  and  Multivariate 
cryptography  as  discussed 
for  post-quantum 
cryptography  .  However,  instead  of  sticking  to  these  four, we 
decided to make it more transparent and focus on the essential 
solutions.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4,  around  25% of  papers  focused 
on lattice-based cryptography. 

[87] 

in 

Consensus is necessary for blockchain for the settlement of 
the transaction. 14% of the papers proposed a new or modified 
consensus  algorithm  using  either  a  new  hash  function,  digital 
signature, or quantum properties. As hash functions and digital 
signatures  are  the  backbones  of  blockchain  technology,  it  is 
necessary to create new or modified signature schemes, and it 
has been found that 11% of research papers focused on hash-
based  signatures  and  11%  of  the  paper  focused  on  quantum 
blind  signatures.  So  these  are  the  key  areas  where  research  is 
going on. Analysing the problems and solutions, it is clear that 
some  layers  still  need  some  work,  like  the  infrastructure  and 
consensus  layers.  These  layers  are  also  necessary.  Findings 
also suggest that some authors give a solution for one layer and 
claim  that  the  blockchain  will  be  posted  quantum  blockchain 
To make blockchain safe from quantum attacks, it is necessary 
to create the solution keeping in mind all the layers and find a 
solution that covers the problems of each layer. 

This  paper  mainly  focused  on  the  research  found  in  the 
literature  to  increase  blockchain  security  in  the  post-quantum 
era.  Some  literature  having  reviews  based  on  different  focus 
areas  are  also  found,  like  authors  in  [95]  focused  on  proof  of 
stake  only,  authors  in  [91]  discuss  the  survival  of  DLTs  after 
quantum  computing.  However,  it  was  not  thorough,  focus  on 
bridging  quantum,  and  classical  computing  is  done  in  [9], 
authors  in  [10]  has  done  a  good  survey  on  post-quantum 
blockchain  and  compared  the  significant  features  of  the  post-
quantum encryption cryptosystems that advanced to the second 
round  of  NIST  call.  This  study  is  restricted  for  database  and 
year  selection to  make  the  review  process repeatable  and free 
from any bias. 

Even after that, many articles are obtained, evaluated, read, 
classified,  and  summarised,  and  answers  to  the  research 
questions are presented. The findings suggest that it is needed 
to  see  blockchain  systems  in layers,  and researchers  should 
provide solutions to the quantum attacks based on these layers.

V.  CONCLUSION 
This  study  starts  with  the  development  of  the  research 
questions.  To  appropriately  answer  these  questions,  the 
systematic  literature  review  is  done,  and  the  process  is 
explained  in-depth,  including  the  database  selection,  search 
process, 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criterion,  creating  and 
extraction  of  fields  and  summarising  the  results.  During  this 
process,  we  found  and  classified  threats  based  on  blockchain 
layers. Some of the threats were spread over different layers, so 
these 
for  a  proper 
explanation. Many different solutions are also found regarding 
these threats. The mapping between these threats and solutions 
has been presented, keeping in mind the full proof solution of 
post-quantum blockchain. 

threats  are  discussed 

individually 

We discovered that blockchain could operate after quantum 
computers,  but  it  must  work on  every  layer  of  the blockchain 
network,  or  the  solution  will  not  be  feasible.  Even  after 
developing solutions, they must be thoroughly tested in the real 
world.  If  a  new  application,  whether  decentralised  or  not,  is 
being  created  on  the  blockchain,  quantum  attacks  should  be 
considered from the planning phase. It has been discovered that 
blockchain  in  its  current  form  is  unsuitable  and  must  be 
modified. In the future, researchers will need to create similar 
solutions  and  test  them  for  all  such  issues  that  have  yet  to  be 
solved or discussed.
