ABSTRACT

Companies are rushing to deliver their services and solutions
through the cloud. The scheduling process is very critical in
reducing delays. Scheduling also has a role in accessing re-
sources without excessive waiting time. All
this in context
of modern advances in infrastructure and the emergence of
Blockchain-as-a-service. What if integration is done between a
hybrid scheduling algorithm and blockchain technology via the
cloud. This integration aims to enhance and provide the ser-
vice uninterruptedly. This method is distinguished, compared to
other scheduling algorithms such as shortest-job-ﬁrst and pri-
ority scheduling, that it does not suffer from starvation and it
has a balanced load on resources. Based on analytical perfor-
mance, the proposed hybrid scheduling has the markable result.

INTRODUCTION

Cloud Computing (CC) provides services through a set of servers
that are hosted on the Internet to keep and manipulate data, rather
than a on a local server. CC relies heavily on scheduling. Optimal
cloud resource allocation is needed to ensure users’ satisfaction [1].
Scheduling is the way in which work is assigned to resources that
achieve work. Scheduling also has a role in accessing resources
without excessive waiting time. There are many types of sched-
ulers [2], such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-
First (SJF), priority, and many more as surveyed in Section 2.
Blockchain technology lies at the epicenter of an anticipated tech-
nological and social shock wave – and it has already started [3].
Major technology companies are racing to provide solutions in this
arena by providing Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) over the cloud.

As demand for this service increases, it is expected that there will
be an urgent need to schedule requests.
this pa-
To enhance and provide the service uninterruptedly,
per seeks an integration among blockchain, cloud, and a hybrid
scheduling algorithm.
This paper overviews common scheduling algorithms for the cloud
(Section 2). Then it proposes the use of a hybrid scheduling algo-
rithm with BaaS (Section 3). It also provides an extensive analysis
of the performance of the proposed method (Section 4).

2. RELATED WORKS

Agent-based scheduling is proposed to achieve scalability and pri-
ority in real-time operation [4]. Vacation queuing theory is adopted
in scheduling tasks while saving energy effectively[5]. Multi-
databank scheduling is proposed based on load Divisibility [6].
Scheduling based on meta-and hyper-heuristic is the best for reduc-
ing the tasks make span[7]. Evolutionary optimization is applied
to minimize tasks make span and cost [8]. Elastic scheduling with
fault-tolerance is proposed [9]. A gaming cloud is proposed in [10],
that balances gaming-responsiveness and costs. While another pa-
per proposed temporal load balancing [11]. It succeeded to achieve
cost reduction of energy too.
Finally, Blind Online Scheduling Algorithm (BOSA) reduces de-
lays and energy consumption [12]. BOSA parameters are schedule
operating time, user-waiting time, and performance improvement
time.
Blockchain has become of great vogue in many ﬁelds [13]. For
instance, it can be used as a safeguard for both security and privacy
[14].

3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

This paper supposes that the data is delivered in blockchain format.
This accomplishes transparency. Suppose that there are m users .
Each of them (Ui, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m) asks for service from the
cloud. The scheduler receives requests, It coordinates with the BaaS
to assign a virtual machine (VM) and blockchain to each user. The
scheduler does not work once and stops, rather it continues to work

ology.

Fig. 1. Proposed Methodology

International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 - 8887)
Volume * - No.*, ——– 2021

Parameters of Virtaul Machines (VMs) are: size = 10000, RAM =
512, MIPS(Millions Instructions Per Second) = 250, bandwidth =
1000, and number of CPUs (pesNumber) = 1
Setting the total number of users is done to be 1000000.
Simulation steps are as follows:

(1) Initialization of CloudSim package
(2) Generating Datacenters
(3) Generating Broker
(4) Generating VMs
(5) Generating Starting the simulation
(6) Printing results

Results are shown in Fig 3

Fig. 2. Components of Proposed Methodology

Fig 2 sketches proposed methodology components. Proposed
methodology operates as the following steps:

(1) Tasks (cloudlets) access the broker.
(2) The broker requests the data center(DC)
(3) DC is hosting virtual machines.
(4) DC registers in Cloud Info Service(CIS).
(5) CIS prepares the virtual blockchains.
(6) CIS sends back the DC characteristics to the broker.

Components of proposed methodology is similar to those of
cloudSim toolkit [15] which is used to model and simulate cloud
environments [16]. Proposed methodology, however, has two extra
components, namely, the BaaS layer (hosted in DC) and the sched-
uler (juxtaposed in CIS) .

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, the
eclipse program was downloaded (Version:Neon.3 Release:4.6.3).
The cloudsim emulator was downloaded too and the settings were
adjusted.
Cloudlet parameters are: length = 40000, ﬁleSize = 300, outputSize
= 300, and pesNumber = 1.

Fig. 3. Comparison among scheduling algorithms

First-Come-First-Served is the worst. The best scheduler is the hy-
brid of Shortest-Job-First and priority. The proposed solution does
not suffer from collision or starvation.

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Scheduling is an urgent problem. It is also linked to cloud comput-
ing. Every service seeker needs it. But the criterion is to provide
the service in less time.
This paper proposes the use of a hybrid scheduler with BaaS. It also
provides an analysis of the performance of the proposed method.
Future directions may consider deploying the proposed methodol-
ogy on any cloud service providers.
