Abstract‚ÄîThe emergence of Intelligent Connected Vehicles
(ICVs) shows great potential for future intelligent trafÔ¨Åc systems,
enhancing both trafÔ¨Åc safety and road efÔ¨Åciency. However, the
ICVs relying on data driven perception and driving models face
many challenges, including the lack of comprehensive knowledge
to deal with complicated driving context. In this paper, we
are motivated to investigate cooperative knowledge sharing for
ICVs. We propose a secure and efÔ¨Åcient directed acyclic graph
(DAG) blockchain based knowledge sharing framework, aiming
to cater for the micro-transaction based vehicular networks. The
framework can realize both local and cross-regional knowledge
sharing. Then, the framework is applied to autonomous driving
applications, wherein machine learning based models for au-
tonomous driving control can be shared. A lightweight tip selec-
tion algorithm (TSA) is proposed for the DAG based knowledge
sharing framework to achieve consensus and identity veriÔ¨Åcation
for cross-regional vehicles. To enhance model accuracy as well as
minimizing bandwidth consumption, an adaptive asynchronous
distributed learning (ADL) based scheme is proposed for model
uploading and downloading. Experiment results show that the
blockchain based knowledge sharing is secure, and it can resist
attacks from malicious users. In addition, the proposed adaptive
ADL scheme can enhance driving safety related performance
compared to several existing algorithms.

I. INTRODUCTION

W ITH the development of vehicular communications

and artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, intelligent connected Vehi-
cles (ICVs) is receiving increasing interest as a promising
technology for tackling the challenges faced by the intelligent
transportation systems [1], [2].
intelligent connected vehi-
cles (ICVs) is the combination of Connected Vehicles (CVs)
and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Served by the ubiquitous
Vehicle to Everything (V2X) technologies, CVs is capable
of sharing sensing data and driving information with other
vehicles and trafÔ¨Åc infrastructures to improve the trafÔ¨Åc safety
and efÔ¨Åciency. Meanwhile, equipped with sensors and intel-
ligent on-board modules, AVs can support intelligent vehic-
ular applications and various levels of driving automation,
such as Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) and
self-driving. Several advanced driving use cases (including
extended sensors and cooperative driving) have been spec-
iÔ¨Åed in the Ô¨Åfth generation (5G) standards. By integrating
the advantages of CVs and AVs, the ICVs is an important

component of future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).
However, the perception and driving models behind the ICVs
are mainly data driven (e.g., trained by huge sensing and
driving data). They are lack of knowledge to deal with unseen
and complex driving scenarios, and security and privacy needs
to be protected in dynamic vehicular network environment. To
address these problems, we are motivated to extend the sharing
of raw sensing data to the sharing of knowledge for ICVs.

Knowledge sharing is deÔ¨Åned as the activities of transferring
or disseminating knowledge among a group of people or orga-
nizations [3]. Semantic webs and knowledge graphs have been
widely used for knowledge sharing in many applications, such
as Question and Answer (Q&A) systems, recommendation
and webpage searching systems. With the aid of emerging
Distributed Learning (DL) technology, knowledge sharing for
ICVs can provide great beneÔ¨Åts to enhance road safety and
driving experiences. ICVs can train their own sensing or
driving data by the on-board computing devices, and obtain
corresponding parameters (ùëí.ùëî. models/policies) as reÔ¨Åned
knowledge. Various levels of knowledge (such as trafÔ¨Åc statis-
tics, trafÔ¨Åc control, driving rules, sensing and driving models,
and crowd sourced maps) can be shared among the ICVs and
the roadside infrastructures. In this case, DL based knowledge
sharing enhances the perception and comprehension of the
driving environment, and support driving decision making [4].
Despite the great potentials held by knowledge sharing of
issues remains to be addressed. On
ICVs, several critical
the one hand, in the DL based knowledge sharing process,
attackers could manipulate the shared knowledge or spread
misleading knowledge. While central entities such as roadside
units (RSUs) could be employed to manage knowledge shar-
ing, they are subjected to various attacks such as single point
of failure. On the other hand, existing DL based knowledge
sharing shows weakness in sharing efÔ¨Åciency. There is a lack
of efÔ¨Åcient management and cooperation of the distributed
knowledge that shared by ICVs. For example, conventional
federated learning enforce workers to train and share their
models in a synchronous manner, resulting in a long delay
due to the intermittent links among ICVs.

To address the above problems, we resort to the emerging
DAG blockchain and asynchronous distributed learning (ADL)
technologies, aiming to achieve secure and efÔ¨Åcient knowledge
sharing in highly dynamic vehicular networks. Compared
to the existing blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum,
utilizing block mining process with Proof-of-work and Proof-
of-Stake that can incur huge computation and communica-
tion loads, there is no concept of blocks in DAG, and the
fundamental unit of DAG is called site that includes a micro-
transaction. The new site can be directly appended on the DAG

without the mining process, thus realizing the lightweight and
resource-saving. Besides, the consensus of DAG is based on
a tip selection algorithm (TSA), which utilize the subsequent
new sites to verify old sites. The more sites are issued, the
faster veriÔ¨Åcations are implemented, thus it is highly desirable
for micro-transaction based mobile and distributed vehicular
networks.

Built on the top of secure context by DAG,

the ADL
shows great potential for enhancing the correlation of shared
knowledge cached in the DAG ledger. By utilizing particular
updating schemes, the ADL servers aggregate the distributed
local knowledge and obtain a comprehensive model to enhance
the accuracy of knowledge. Compared with conventional syn-
chronous distributed learning [5], the ADL supports ICVs to
upload their models in an asynchronous way, and the ICVs can
obtain the on-the-Ô¨Çy updated model without waiting for others,
which is suitable for the high dynamic vehicular networks.

Therefore, we propose a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
blockchain based knowledge sharing framework. The frame-
work exploits a consortium blockchain architecture, wherein
ICVs share their trained local models as knowledge, and issue
the models as sites to the DAG blockchain. RSUs act as
the DAG nodes to maintain the ledger, as well as being the
tamper-proof, attack-resistance ADL servers to aggregate the
distributed knowledge from the DAG ledger. It is noted the
framework is general for different ICV applications, thereby
different DAG and ADL related schemes can be designed to
cater for the quality of service (QoS) of different applications.
In order to show the potential of the proposed framework,
a speciÔ¨Åc application to autonomous driving is investigated,
wherein driving control related models can be shared by ICVs.
The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:

‚Ä¢ We propose a secure and efÔ¨Åcient knowledge sharing
framework for ICVs based on DAG blockchain, wherein
both local and cross-regional knowledge sharing are in-
tegrated. The DAG blockchain can guarantee the security
and tamper-proof of the shared knowledge that is impor-
tant for ICV safety and driving applications. The RSUs
act as both DAG nodes and ADL servers, so that it can
aggregate and manage the distributed knowledge from the
DAG ledger to enhance the knowledge sharing efÔ¨Åciency.
‚Ä¢ Built on the top of the framework, we develop a DAG
blockchain for autonomous driving application. A re-
versed two hop tip selection algorithm is proposed to
achieve lightweight consensus that takes driving style of
ICVs into consideration during tip approval process. A
classiÔ¨Åed DAG ledger is designed to record the shared
knowledge of ICVs, aiming to enhance the correlation
of the knowledge. Based on the proposed algorithm,
an identity veriÔ¨Åcation scheme for cross-region ICVs is
proposed without introducing additional storage costs.
The convergence of the ledgers in the DAG blockchain
system is proved with mathematic analysis.

‚Ä¢ In order to minimize bandwidth consumption as well
as improving model accuracy, an adaptive asynchronous
distributed learning scheme is proposed for the uploading
and aggregating processes of shared knowledge. The
convergence of the proposed ADL is proved, and the
optimal model weight and ICV driving style are analyzed

based on the optimal convergence point.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
present related works of knowledge sharing, blockchain and
distributed learning in Section II. The overview of the pro-
posed DAG based knowledge sharing framework is presented
in Section III. In Section IV,
the blockchain knowledge
sharing is applied for autonomous driving application. The
system components are presented and the convergence of the
blockchain ledger is proved. The design and convergence anal-
ysis of the ADL algorithm is presented in Section V. In Section
VI, experiment and simulation results for the blockchain
knowledge sharing and ADL algorithm are presented and
discussed. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VII.

II. RELATED WORK
Knowledge sharing in internet of vehicles (IoV) has been
studied recently. By utilizing the information of vehicular
trajectories, a clustering scheme was proposed based on the
semi-Markov process [6]. Rula ùëíùë°.ùëéùëô proposed a data fusion
algorithm to realize vehicular context awareness [7]. A joint
rate control and resource allocation scheme was developed
with the information of channel states and delay constraints
[8]. During the information sharing process, it is crucial to
guarantee the security and reliability, which has not been ad-
dressed in these works. Tampered or malicious knowledge can
cause severe safety issues and degrade system performance. In
this case, the emerging blockchain technology shows strong
resistance to malicious attacks, and it has attracted increasing
attention.

In literature [9], a user-centric blockchain (UCB) framework
was proposed to preserve the reliability of edge data,
in
which a lightweight consensus mechanism was developed.
To maintain the traceability of data, Lin ùëíùë° ùëéùëô. presented
a consortium blockchain [10]. For ICVs, a service-oriented
public blockchain was proposed for ride-sharing that aims to
guarantee trust and fair payment during the sharing process
[11]. Cui ùëíùë° ùëéùëô. proposed a blockchain-enabled payment
paradigm in which the data is encrypted and outsourced
decryption is payable [12]. However, most existing works
utilized ‚Äùùëèùëôùëúùëêùëò‚Äù data structures to store data in blockchains,
which introduces additional packing expenditure and mining
consumption. Moreover, the ‚Äùùëê‚Ñéùëéùëñùëõ‚Äù structure leads to a time-
consuming consensus process and a slow data recording,
which is not suitable for large-scale ICV networks. Therefore,
the existing blockchain frameworks are not readily applicable
to the ICV network.

To further enhance the efÔ¨Åciency of knowledge sharing, DL
has been studied for vehicular networks. A DL framework
was developed to maintain the communication efÔ¨Åciency of
IoV, and packet loss probability and throughput were analyzed
under the framework [13]. Zhang ùëíùë° ùëéùëô. proposed a two time
scales DL algorithm to implement mode selection and resource
allocation for vehicular networks [14]. Although the above
studies have made great efforts on knowledge sharing, they are
either insecure or not efÔ¨Åcient for dynamic ICV networks. And
they have not consider the ICV driving safety applications.

III. DESIGN OF THE KNOWLEDGE SHARING FRAMEWORK
We aim to design an efÔ¨Åcient and secure knowledge sharing
framework for ICVs, in which ICVs extract knowledge from

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

raw data and share the knowledge with others. In order to
ensure the security of knowledge sharing, we propose a DAG
blockchain-based approach to encapsulate sharing knowledge.
The knowledge sharing framework is shown in Fig. 1. The
whole ICV network is divided into multiple trafÔ¨Åc regions.
In each region, there is a consortium-based DAG blockchain,
where RSUs act as DAG nodes to cache the DAG ledger.
Vehicles within one region will continuously collect data
and extract the knowledge from environment. They share the
knowledge as ùë†ùëñùë°ùëís that are sent to the RSUs for consensus.
The basic workÔ¨Çow of the knowledge sharing process can

be described by the following four steps.

(1). Knowledge Extracting and Site Generation: By uti-
lizing sensors and computing devices, ICVs extract valuable
knowledge ùêæ ùë† from the original raw data, such as trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çow
trend and driving conÔ¨Åguration parameters. The term ùë† is the
impact scope of knowledge, which is regarded as the criterion
for the judgement of cross-region knowledge sharing. After
completing a simple proof-of-work calculation ùëê, the vehicle
encapsulates the shared knowledge ùêæ ùë† together with ùëê into a
site. The site includes the signature of the vehicle ùëÜùëñùëî that is
generated by its private key, and the hash value ùêª of the site.
The typical format of a site ùëÜùë£ is as follows,
ùëÜ = {ùêª, ùêæ ùë†
ùë£ , ùëì , ùëêùë£ , w, ùëÜùëñùëîùë£ }

(1)

where w is the vector of its own weight and cumulative
weight of one site.
is the feature term of the shared
knowledge, which contains different features according to
different applications.

ùëì

(2). Knowledge Verifying and Appending: The encapsulated
site is then broadcast to vehicular network and append to the
DAG ledger. The issuing ICV will choose and verify two
existing tips on the DAG ledger according to the tip selection
algorithm. The veriÔ¨Åcation method varies depending on the
application scenario.

(3). Local Knowledge Sharing: Within each trafÔ¨Åc region,
a consortium based DAG architecture is adopted. RSUs act
as the blockchain nodes to cache and synchronize the local
DAG ledger. At the same time, the RSUs can aggregate the
knowledge that is cached in the DAG ledger, and act as the
ADL servers to update the distributed knowledge to obtain
a comprehensive knowledge. ICVs can check the aggregated
knowledge that
their surrounding RSUs, and
exploit the comprehensive knowledge to make decisions.

is stored at

(4). Cross-Region Knowledge Sharing: For an ICV driving
across the regions, the RSUs will decide whether to deliver
the cross-region knowledge to the vehicle for cross-regional
sharing. The impact scope ùë† of the knowledge is used for the
delivery decision. The idea is that the knowledge with a small
impact range does not need to be transmitted to nearby regions.
It is noted that the RSUs will transmit to cross-regional ICVs
not the total ledger, but the cross-region knowledge that is
encapsulated as sites.

There are two characteristics of the proposed framework:
(a) for local sharing, the RSUs have two identities at the same
time: the DAG ledger maintainers and the ADL servers. The
RSUs can load the knowledge cached in the ledger, and imple-
ment corresponding updating schemes according to different
applications, which strengthen the cooperation between the

independent, distributed knowledge in DAG ledger. Compared
with conventional ADL updating schemes, the comprehensive
knowledge obtained by RSU is updated with the tamper-proof
distributed knowledge that is cached in the ledger, which is
essentially reliable and traceable. This can prevent the single
point of failure and malicious ADL servers, since other RSUs
or ICVs can check the tamper-proof ledger to verify the com-
prehensive knowledge. (b) for cross-region sharing, existing
blockchain based systems utilize global consensus mechanism
to realize the cross-region sharing that will introduce heavy
communication cost. The proposed framework enables cross-
regional ICVs to carry the knowledge, and issue the knowledge
as a new site in other regions. Since there is no block packing
and mining process in the DAG based framework, the new
site with cross-region knowledge can be directly appended of
other regions‚Äô ledger, which realize fast sharing of cross-region
knowledge.

IV. DAG BASED KNOWLEDGE SHARING FOR
AUTONOMOUS DRIVING APPLICATION

In order to show the potentials of the framework, we inves-
tigate an application of the proposed DAG based knowledge
sharing for autonomous driving, in which ICVs share their
driving-control related knowledge via trained models with
others, and other ICVs can exploit the shared knowledge to
make better self-driving decision.

The driving-control knowledge is related to control of
multiple factors such as longitudinal motion, yaw dynamic
and driving route. We will base our investigation on the open
source autonomous driving environment, Airsim, which was
developed by Microsoft AI & Research team [15]. In the
Airsim environment, driving control is characterized with three
parameters: vehicular throttle ùëé, wheel steering ùëè and braking
ùëê. According to the Airsim project, we deÔ¨Åne a driving style
indicator (denoted by ùëö) to quantify the driving style, which
is computed as

ùëö =

ùëé(1 ‚àí ùëê) + ùëè2
2

,

(2)

The driving style indicator can reÔ¨Çect the following facts:
whether throttle ùëé = 0 or braking ùëê = 1, the ICVs will remain

4

stationary, and either a large ùëé or a sharply steering of ùëè will
give a large value of driving style indicator ùëö.

A. WorkÔ¨Çow of the DAG based Knowledge Sharing For Au-
tonomous Driving

For

the blockchain knowledge sharing supported au-

tonomous driving, the following workÔ¨Çow is designed.

1) Local Training of an autonomous driving model (adM):
Each ICV utilizes its on-board sensing and computing
resources to train adM. In our speciÔ¨Åc scenario, a
convolutional neural network is utilized as the adM, with
collected context images and its driving style indicator
ùëö as input, and driving control values as output.

2) Site Packaging and Issuing: As

indicated in Se-
cion III. (1), the knowledge is encapsulated as ùëÜ =
{ùêª, Œ¶, ùëö, ùëê, w, ùëÜùëñùëîùë£ }, where Œ¶ is the driving-control
model adM. Then, the site is directly append on the
DAG ledger that is cached by RSUs.

3) TSA-based Site VeriÔ¨Åcation: As indicated in Section
III.(2), the issuing ICV chooses two existing tips on
the DAG ledger according to TSA, and utilizes its test
dataset to verify the adMs encapsulated in the two tips.
We utilize the testing accuracy ùëô to quantify the per-
formance of the trained adMs [16]. In the autonomous
driving application, the testing accuracy can be denoted
by the control gap between the real control parameters
of testing data and the predict parameters, which can be
measured by absolute error (denoted by ùëí) as

ùëí =

ùëõ

ùëÅ
‚àëÔ∏Å

ùëñ=1

|ùë¶ùëñ ‚àí ùëì (ùë•ùëñ)|,

(3)

where ùëì (ùë•ùëñ) is the predict control parameter of the
trained adM, and ùë¶ùëñ is the actual control of the testing
data. If the testing performance gap is smaller than a
certain value, ùëñ.ùëí. ùëí ‚â§ ùúñ, the veriÔ¨Åcation process is
deemed as valid, and the ICV can append the new site
on the DAG ledger.

4) Knowledge Sharing and Application to Autonomous
Driving: After the veriÔ¨Åcation process, other ICVs can
check and download the shared adM that is recorded in
the DAG ledgers, then they can input their own image
and driving style indicator to the updated adM model to
produce control output for autonomous driving.

B. Reversed Two-hop Tip Selection and Driving-style Classi-
Ô¨Åed Ledger

While the DAG blockchain system has good security perfor-
mance against malicious attacks, it has weakness in the appli-
cation to autonomous driving control. In the existing top DAG
blockchains such as Hashgraph, IOTA utilizes random-walk
based TSA, which uses an approach of randomly verifying the
tips for new sites. In the autonomous driving scenarios where
the driving models are related to driving style, the "random
veriÔ¨Åcation" manner will degrade the veriÔ¨Åcation rate and the
successful rate of new sites being recorded to the chain, thus
degrade the knowledge sharing efÔ¨Åciency.

In order to solve the above problem, we design a new
TSA for the autonomous driving application, which is called

Fig. 2: Illustration of RTH-TSA Algorithm and DC-Ledger

reversed two-hop tip selection algorithm (RTH-TSA). The
RTH-TSA algorithm enables the new sites to verify the tips
with similar driving style.

RTH-TSA: SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we reverse the tracing order of
site to develop fast tip selection. Traditional DAG utilizes
the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to reach
consensus, in which the vehicles is required to trace and verify
the previous ùëä sites (parameter ùëä is called particle deep and
its value is large [17]). In tour proposed RTH-TSA, when a
new site chooses tips to append, it does not have to trace from
particle deep. Conversely, it directly chooses two existing tips
from its side to connect. Accordingly, the selection probability
from site ùë• to ùë¶ can be shown as:
ùë¶ + ùê∂ùëä 2

ùë¶) ‚àí ùõΩ(ùëö ùë• ‚àí ùëö ùë¶)2}

ùëÉùë• ùë¶ =

ùëíùë• ùëù{‚àíùõº(ùê∂ùëä 1

ùëß + ùê∂ùëä 2

ùëß ) ‚àí ùõΩ(ùëö ùë• ‚àí ùëöùëß)2}

,

(4)

where T represents the set of current tips of the DAG ledger
and ùõº, ùõΩ are both positive weight parameters. ùê∂ùëä 1
ùë¶ and ùê∂ùëä 2
ùë¶
are cumulative weights of two sites that are approved by tip ùë¶.
The cumulative weight adopted in Eq. (3) aims to prevent ùëôùëéùëßùë¶
sites from choosing two old sites instead of two tips. If the
lazy sites are appended to the existing old sites, the probability
of the lazy sites being appended will be largely reduced and
they will eventually become the "orphan" sites.

DC-Ledger: Since the tip selection algorithm deÔ¨Ånes how
a new site connects to the DAG ledger, ùëñ.ùëí., how the site is
veriÔ¨Åed by others. The TSA will determine the ledger structure
and how the sites are appended on the DAG. In this case,
the proposed RTH-TSA enforces the new sites to verify and
append behind those tips with similar driving styles. The total
DAG ledger will eventually evolve to multiple sub-ledger,each
of which records the sites with similar driving styles. This
realizes the driving-pattern classiÔ¨Åcation of the ledger (DC-
ledger). According to the veriÔ¨Åcation process described in
subsection-A, the veriÔ¨Åcation rate can be enhanced. The design
of the RTH-TSA and DC-Ledger is illustrated in Fig. 2.

C. Knowledge Sharing among Multiple Regions

In the proposed framework, we utilize moving ICVs to
exchange the knowledge among different trafÔ¨Åc regions, rather
than using global consensus. Note that there is no need to

DAG and does not need extra storage space, which realizes
lightweight process.

D. The Ledger Convergence

To tackle the problems in the existing TSA of DAG, we
exploited the architecture of DC ledger with multiple sub-
ledgers. However, to ensure the feasibility and effectiveness of
the DAG system, the ledger must remain convergent, which
means that the total number of tips of the DC ledger cannot
escape to inÔ¨Ånity. In this subsection, the convergence of the
ledgers will be analyzed.

Assume that the ICVs issue new sites independently with
the distribution ùêºùëõ. Let us denote ùëáùëõ as the number of tips in
the proposed DAG at the ùëõ-th approval round. In this case, the
total number of tips in the network can be expressed as

ùëõ
ùê∏ [ùëá ùëÄùëò
ùëõ

ùëáùëõ = ùëáùëõ‚àí1 + ùêºùëõ ‚àí ùê¥ùëõ,
where ùê¥ùëõ is the number of approved tips by ùêºùëõ. Assume that
the driving style indicator range is divided into ùêæ discrete in-
tervals M = {ùëÄ1, ..., ùëÄùëò , ...ùëÄùêæ }, and the mobility distribution
of vehicles is ùëö(ùë°) with respect to time ùë°. For one speciÔ¨Åc
sub-ledger ùëò that locates on the mobility interval ùëÄùëò ‚àà M, the
expectation of ùëá ùëÄùëò

In order to obtain the value of ùê∏ [ùëá ùëÄùëò
], the distribution
ùëõ
of ùêº ùëÄùëò
should be speciÔ¨Åed. The incoming tips can
ùëõ
follow the poisson, uniform and gamma distributions, ùëíùë°ùëê. In
this section, we only select one ordinary poisson distribution
with a incoming rate ùúÜ and prove the convergence under the
distribution. More distribution examples will be investigated
in the simulation part. Hence, the Eq. (7) can be expressed as
ùê∏ [ùëá ùëÄùëò

indicator ùëÄùëò , there must be a total of (cid:205)ùêæ

transmit all the knowledge to other regions. The knowledge
with a small impact range will not be transmitted to other
regions, as the knowledge does not affect other regions. The
RSUs only have to transmit those important adM knowledge
to the adjacent regions to the cross-regional ICVs.

To ensure trust and reliability of the shared knowledge for
the autonomous driving application, cross-regional knowledge
needs to be carried by authenticated ICVs. Therefore, it is
crucial to design an identity veriÔ¨Åcation scheme for those
cross-regional ICVs. Existing schemes utilize identity tokens
for the veriÔ¨Åcation process [18], which will introduce extra
storage consumption and communication cost for knowledge
sharing. Therefore, we design an efÔ¨Åcient identity veriÔ¨Åcation
scheme for cross-regional ICVs that does not use identity
tokens.

Fast Identity Authentication Scheme: There are two special
sites during the authentication process: one is cross-regional
site ùëÜùëê
ùëü , and the other is IdentityStone ùëÜùëñùë†. As illustrated in
Fig. 3, considering a cross-regional scenario that ICV ùë¶ leaves
region ùê¥ to region ùêµ. If RSUs of region ùê¥ decide to share the
knowledge with ùêµ, they send to ùë¶ the cross-regional site ùëÜùëê
ùëü ,
containing the knowledge and the current scope ùë†. Meanwhile,
RSUs of region ùêµ will issue a IdentityStone ùëÜùëñùë†, which is
signed with its private key ùëÜùëñùëîùëü . The formats of the two special
sites are expressed as
ùëü = {ùêª, ùêæ ùë†, w = 0, ùëÜùëñùëîùëü }
ùëÜùëê
ùëÜùëñùë† = {ùêª, w = 0, ùëÜùëñùëîùëü }

(5)

To make the scheme lightweight, we remove some unnec-
essary elements in IdentityStone such as knowledge ùêæ and
address. The reason for setting the cumulative weight and own
weight to 0 is to avoid affecting the current weight of the DAG
ledger, which is inspired by the Project ùëá ùëéùëõùëîùëôùëí [17].

When a vehicle ùë¶ issues the Ô¨Årst site in the new region ùêµ,
it must approve the two speciÔ¨Åc sites ùëÜùëñùë† and ùëÜùëê
ùëü . After that, ùë¶
is deemed to have completed identity veriÔ¨Åcation. Noting that
the cumulative weight of both sites is 0, the newly coming
sites of other ICVs in region ùêµ will Ô¨Årst verify the site of the
cross-regional vehicle ùë¶ according to Eq.(3), which completes
the fast authentication of vehicle ùë¶.

As ùë¶ will approve ùëÜùëê

ùëü from its original region ùê¥ when it
joins a new region, vehicle ùë¶ is traceable if it is malicious. The
scheme utilizes the process of site approval that is inherent in

and is independent of the other tip approval events. Hence,
the conditional probability is a multinomial distribution with
parameters ùëÉùëÄ1, ùëÉùëÄ2 ..., ùëÉùëÄùêæ , and the joint probability can be
expressed as

ùëÉ{ ùê¥ùëÄ1ùëõ (‚Ñé) = ùëõ1, ùê¥ùëÄ2ùëõ (‚Ñé) = ùëõ2..., ùê¥ùëÄùêæ

Consequently, during each approval round, the total number
of tips of all sub-ledgers is the same as that of the previous
round. Although the number of tips of each sub-ledger in each
round may be different, the total number of their tips remains
constant, which proves the convergence of the ledger.

V. ASYNCHRONOUS DISTRIBUTED LEARNING ENHANCED
DAG FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
Although the proposed DAG based knowledge sharing can
provide reliability and security for autonomous driving appli-
cation, there could still be accuracy and communication related
issues: (a). As the adMs cached in the DAG ledger are only
the local models that are trained independently, they could
be far away from the optimal one obtained by joint training;
(b). For the large-scale autonomous driving scenarios,
the
ICVs continuously broadcasting their adMs could signiÔ¨Åcantly
increase the communication load of the ICV networks.

To tackle the above issues, we exploit asynchronous dis-
tributed learning (ADL) to enhance the DAG based knowledge
sharing system, in which the RSUs will be responsible for the
processing as well as maintaining the adMs in the DAG ledger.

A. Adaptive Asynchronous Distributed Learning Enhanced
DAG Knowledge Sharing

The design objectives of the ADL algorithm is to exploit
the correlation among different adMs in the DAG ledger, and
obtain a comprehensive global model to enhance the accuracy
of the autonomous driving related model. Compared with
conventional synchronous distributed learning, the ADL can
support ICVs to upload their local models in an asynchronous
way, and they can obtain the on-the-Ô¨Çy updated model without
waiting for other ICVs, which is suitable for the high dynamic

autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, considering the
difference of the ICV training ability, there is no need to
enforce all the ICVs to upload their local adMs. Some local
adMs with lower learning performance may even degrade the
accuracy of global model. Therefore, we propose an adaptive
scheme for the ADL, aiming to enhancing the accuracy of
Ô¨Ånal global model and reduce the communication cost among
ICVs.

The speciÔ¨Åc workÔ¨Çow of the adaptive ADL enhanced DAG

knowledge sharing process is described as follows.

1) Initialization: The RSUs cache a global adM (GadM)
in advance with model version ùëâùê∫ = 1, and the initial
GadM can be obtained by ofÔ¨Çine learning methods. Each
RSU caches an identical and periodically updated test
dataset.

2) GadM Broadcasting: The RSUs periodically broadcast
the reference gap ùëíùê∫ of current GadM that is evaluated
by RSUs‚Äô test dataset as indicated in Section IV-A-
(3), current model version ùëâùê∫, together with its digital
signature ùëÜùëñùëîùëü to surrounding ICVs.

3) Judging the Reliability of GadM: Upon receiving the
multiple information from RSUs, ICVs check the re-
ceived versions and signatures of GadM, which can
prevent the single point failure of RSUs. The ICVs will
choose the version sent by most RSUs as the credible
GadM version.

4) Adaptive adM Site Issuing: After verify the reliability
of the GadM, the ICV will compare the test gap ùëíùë£ of
its own local adM with reference gap ùëíùê∫. If ùëíùë£ ‚â§ ùëíùê∫,
the ICV can believe that its local adM outperform the
current GadM, and it will encapsulate its model and its
driving styles indicator ùëö into new site ùëÜ, as indicated in
Section IV-A. If ùëíùë£ > ùëíùê∫, the ICV will not issue a new
site to the DAG, and will download the current GadM
from RSUs as its model.

5) Asynchronous Updating GadM: By receiving the new
adM from the ICV, the RSUs will Ô¨Årst utilize its test
dataset to evaluate the received adM. If the test gap
ùëíùëü ‚â§ ùúñ (ùëíùëü is the test gap of the received adM tested
by RSUs), the adM is deemed as valid and can be
appended by other new sites. Then, the RSUs update
the current version ùëâ = ùëâ + 1, and update the GadM in
an asynchronous way by referring to the driving style
based updating scheme, which will be discussed in the
next subsection. If ùëíùëü > ùúñ, the RSUs will send a fail
signaling back to the ICV, and back to step (2).

Noting that the adaptive site issuing process utilizes the
same metric, which is the test performance gap ùëí deÔ¨Åned
in Eq.(3), to measure the model quality. The metric is used
to facilitate the system implementation and management in
practice. With the adaptive scheme, those adMs with a low
accuracy will not be appended on the DAG ledger, which will
enhance the quality of global model GadM. Furthermore, with
less uploaded models the communication loads between the
ICVs and the RSUs can be signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced.

B. Driving Style based Asynchronous Updating Scheme

Next, we will elaborate the process of Asynchronous Up-
dating GadM in Step 5) of the adaptive ADL presented in

the last subsection. Taking into account the variety in the
driving styles of ICVs, there are also differences in accuracy
between adMs of ICVs. It is inappropriate to aggregate the
adMs regardless of their driving styles. Therefore, we propose
a driving style based updating scheme for the ADL algorithm,
which combines both driving styles of ICVs and the freshness
of adMs.

Considering the ADL process that ùëÅ ICVs succeed in
issuing adMs within ùëá time, each ICV utilizes stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to implement local training
ùúÉùëô (ùë°) = ùúÉùëô (ùë° ‚àí 1) ‚àí ùõæ(cid:79)ùêπùëô (ùë°), where ùúÉùëô represents the adM and
ùêπùëô is the local optimization function. Then, the global model
GadM ùëù‚Ñéùëñ at time ùë° can be expressed as

(13)

Œ¶(ùë°) = (1 ‚àí ùõºùë° ùëìùë° )Œ¶(ùë°‚àí) + ùõºùë° ùëìùë° ùúÉùëô
ùë°
where ùë°‚àí is deÔ¨Ånes as the time index of last asynchronous
updating, and ùëìùë° is the function of computing the freshness
of local models that is utilized to describe the decay of old
weights over time. The freshness (denoted by ùëìùë° ) is computed
as

ùëìùë° = ùëí1‚àí ùë°
ùëá ,
and the ùõºùë° in Eq.(14) represents the driving-related weight.

(14)

Driving style is a reÔ¨Çection of the interaction between ICVs
and the external environment, which contains the knowledge
of context and driving control. For example, on the same
road segment, ICVs with different driving velocities will have
diverse safe braking distance. Therefore, it is inappropriate to
aggregate all adMs together in one global model regardless of
the impact of driving styles. In this case, we deÔ¨Åne ùõºùë° as
ùëöùë°
ùõºùë° = 1 ‚àí (cid:102)

(15)

ùëöùë° is the relative driving style indicator of ICV
where term (cid:102)
at time ùë°, that is described as (cid:102)
ùëöùë° = |ùëöùë° ‚àí ùëÄùë° |, and ùëÄùë° is the
average driving style indicator, ùëöùë° is the driving style indicator
deÔ¨Åned in Eq.(2).

The driving style based updating process is illustrated by
Algorithm 1. The computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm is mainly determined by the process from Line 2 to
Line 13. According to [20], the time complexity of sampling
and updating from Line 7 to Line 9 is ùëÇ (ùëôùëúùëîùëÅùë°ùëü ùëíùëí), where
ùëÅùë°ùëü ùëíùëí is the number of nodes in the sum-tree used to compute
the priority probability. As the time complexity of model
aggregation scheme in Line 11 to Line 13 is ùëÇ (1), the total
time complexity is ùëÇ (ùëÅùëôùëúùëîùëÅùë°ùëü ùëíùëí).

It can be found that the proposed updating scheme differs
from the traditional DL process. The global model is updated
with an adjustable weight ùõºùë° ùëìùë° , which is related to the fresh-
ness of adMs and driving style indicator of ICVs. Next, we will
analyze the optimal weight and driving style of ICVs under
the proposed updating scheme. Simulations also demonstrated
the proposed scheme outperformed existing DL algorithms in
the autonomous driving scenarios.

C. Analysis of Optimal Model Weight and ICV Driving Style

Since we adopt a driving style based updating scheme, it is
essential to discuss the impact of the weight on the training
accuracy. The convergence bound of distributed learning is
utilized, which characterizes the gap between the optimal

with the pioneer work [22]. For the sake of limited space, we
will not present the proof but directly give the convergence
bound of the proposed ADL.

optimal ùõº‚àó will increase with learning time ùëá. Since ùõº can
be expressed as ùõº = 1
(1 ‚àí |ùëöùë° ‚àí ùëÄùë° |),
ùëÅùëá
we can decrease the number of those ICVs with ùëöùë° that are
far away from the average ùëÄùë° , so that the value of ùõº will not
decrease. The remark can be explained by the fact that the local
models trained by those ICVs with a deviated driving style
cannot reÔ¨Çect the accurate global context, and we can reduce
the use of models from those ICVs to reduce the uploading
communications while maintaining the global training quality.

Obviously ùëã2 = ùëã3 < 0, since ùõº is the expectation value of

ùëã1 into the second derivation of P (ùë•), and P (cid:48)(cid:48)(ùëã1) > 0.

Based on Proposition 1, we have two remarks with respect

to model weight ùõº and driving style indicator ùëö.

optimal weight ùõº‚àó that is associate with learning time ùëá. With

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the proposed DAG based knowl-
edge sharing framework and ADL algorithm by simulation
experiments. The performance of the DAG based framework is
Ô¨Årst investigated, followed by simulation tests of the proposed
ADL scheme.

(24)

A. Simulation Setup

We evaluate the DAG based knowledge sharing framework
in Matlab, in which the sites contains both driving style indi-
cator ùëö and shared knowledge (ùëñ.ùëí. the adM). New sites are
generated following three distributions: uniform distribution
within (400, 500), poisson distribution with ùúÜ = 700 and
gamma distribution with ùõº = 200, ùõΩ = 1. The tip selection
probability is based on Eq. (4). We further control ICVs by
Logitech G29 Driving Force Steering Wheel and Pedal to sim-
ulate real driving style of ICVs. Three types of driving styles
are adopted: ùëö1-type for ICVs has a large throttle ùëé = 0.9,
a small steering ùëè ‚àà [‚àí0.2, 0.2], braking ùëê = 0, and the
corresponding driving style indicator ùëö1 ‚àà [0.45, 0.47]; ùëö2-
type has ùëé = 0.5, large steering ùëè ‚àà [0.6, 0.9], [‚àí0.6, ‚àí0.9],
ùëê = 0, and ùëö2 ‚àà [0.43, 0.65]; ùëö3-type has ùëé = 0.9, ùëè = 0.1,
high braking pattern ùëê ‚àà [0.5, 0.8], and ùëö3 ‚àà [0.095, 0.23].
The tip veriÔ¨Åcation process is simulated with setting ùëö2-type
ICVs to train a target adM, and enforcing the three types of
ICVs to respectively test the target adM in terms of test gap,
as described in Section IV.A.(3).

Then the ADL is investigated with the open-source project
Airsim, which provides a platform for AI research for au-
tonomous vehicles. We focus on the city scenario of Airsim,

in which 35 vehicles are utilized for evaluation of ADL.
The vehicles are controlled by Logitech G29 to drive around
their surrounding images to build a
the city and collect
dataset. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model is
adopted as our local model. The driving style indicator ùëö
and the collected images are chosen as the input of the CNN
model, and the output is the steering value of vehicles. The
performance of ADL is evaluated in terms of loss function,
test gap and violation rate. Here the violation rate is deÔ¨Åned
as the the percentage of bad behaviours of new vehicles
autonomous driving with the trained CNN models in Airsim,
such as retrograde motion or driving to pedestrian lanes. Three
existing algorithms are chosen as the comparison groups: the
standard federated learning (FedAve) [24] that aggregates the
local models from all vehicles synchronously and ignores the
driving style, an autonomous driving algorithm (cook-AD)
proposed by Project Road Runner at Microsoft Garage [25]
that only exploit the local view of vehicles without referring
to other vehicles, and the centralized CNN that trains on the
whole centralized dataset.

The simulation environment is illustrated in Fig. 4 and the
main parameters used in the simulations are summarized in
Table I.

B. Numerical Results and Discussion

The proposed driving style aware DAG framework is eval-
uated Ô¨Årst. The convergence results of the proposed DC-
Ledger are shown in Fig. 5. Three tip-arrival distributions are
considered, as indicated in Section. VI. A. Two initial number

of sites are set, ùëñ.ùëí. high genesis sites=1000 and low genesis
sites=10. It can be found that no matter what the genesis
number is, the Ô¨Ånal tip number will become stable, which
shows the convergence of the proposed DAG ledger.

Fig. 6 presents the changes of DC-DAG ledger with dif-
ferent driving style for the genesis sites. The ùë¶-coordinate of
the point in the Ô¨Ågure represents the value of the driving style
indicator. The driving style indicator value of the bottom point
is close to 0, and the indicator value of the top point is close
to 1. We set the value of the driving style indicators of genesis
sites (ùëñ.ùëí. points in the leftmost column) in a descending
order, then we input incoming sites with different driving
style indicators in each transaction round, which choose tips
according to RTH-TSA in Eq. (4). It can be obtained that
with the transaction rounds, the total DAG ledger is logically
divided into multiple sub-ledgers. This can be explained by
the designed RTH-TSA: According to Eq. (4), the new tips
will Ô¨Årstly be appended behind the sites with similar driving
styles. With the tip selection algorithm processing, the ledger
will eventually evolve to multiple driving style classiÔ¨Åed sub-
ledgers, each of which contains the sites with similar driving
styles. The DC-ledger veriÔ¨Åes the effectiveness of the proposed
RTH-TSA, and it is beneÔ¨Åcial for the site veriÔ¨Åcation process.
Based on the DC DAG ledger, we evaluated the knowledge
sharing efÔ¨Åciency in terms of veriÔ¨Åcation loss and test gap.
The veriÔ¨Åcation loss is the loss function value produced by the
veriÔ¨Åcation of a pre-trained model over veriÔ¨Åcation data. We
let the three driving style types ùëö1, ùëö2, ùëö3 of ICVs to verify
the adM that is trained by ùëö2-type ICVs. The testing results are
presented in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. In Fig. 7, it can be found that the
ICVs with ùëö2-type have the minimal veriÔ¨Åcation loss value.
This indicates the veriÔ¨Åcation loss can reach the optimal if the
driving style indicator of ICVs matches that of the adM. Note
that the proposed RTH-TSA will enforce the sites to verify

be reduced. As shown in the Ô¨Ågure, the adaptive ADL with
ùëíùê∫=0.0156 can achieve a more than 30 % reduction towards
the non-adaptive scheme. By reducing the communication
cost, the Ô¨Ånal leaning quality of the GadM does not degrade,
which proves that the proposed scheme is suitable for the
large-scale ICV networks.

Then, we investigate the impact of freshness on the model
learning loss. The results are presented in Fig. 10. The per-
formance of the CNN model trained in a centralized approach
is adopted here as the optimal training result. It can be seen
that the proposed ADL has a loss very close to the optimal
one, while that of FedAve is much higher. Therefore, from the
perspective of global model training process, the subsequent
local model tends to have a greater inÔ¨Çuence than previous
models, as expressed in Remark 1. The freshness ensures that
the weight of subsequent models is higher than the earlier
ones.

The results on the impact of driving style indicator on the
model quality are shown in Fig. 11. The participant ICVs have
test gap ùëíùë£ ‚â§ ùëíùê∫, which are capable of uploading their adMs.
Here the total 35 vehicles are divided into three types ùëö1, ùëö2
and ùëö3, as shown in Table 1. The speciÔ¨Åc numbers of the ICVs
with these three types are set as ùëÅùëö1+ùëö2 = 20, ùëÅùëö3 = 15. And
we set the average ùëÄ = 0.5. Since the driving style indicator of
ùëö3-type is [0.095, 0.23], the ùëö3-type vehicles can be regraded
as those ICVs with indicators far away from the average ùëÄ.
As shown in Fig. 11, the loss values of both 12 ICVs
with ùëö3-type and 7 ICVs with ùëö3-type are very close to that
of full participants scenario. By reduce the number of those
"deviated" ICVs, we can reduce the communication cost of
model updating,meanwhile ensuring the learning quality of
global model, which veriÔ¨Åes the claim in Remark 2. Moreover,
if we keep decrease the number of ICVs to the 0 ùëö3-type
scenario in the Ô¨Ågure, the learning loss will increase. This can
be explained that although the deviated ICVs have little impact
on the global model, their models do contain some information
that other ICVs don‚Äôt have. In order to obtain an accurate
model, the Ô¨Ånal comprehensive model should aggregate some
adMs from those deviated ICVs.

The violation rate results are presented in Fig. 12. With
the iteration process, the proposed ADL algorithm achieves
a 20% reduction in violation rate over the cook-AD and
FedAve algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm. It can also be found that both the
proposed ADL and the FedAve algorithms converge faster
than the cook-AD. It can be explained by that utilizing the
updating schemes, the distributed learning-based algorithms
can collect local models from multiple distributed ICVs. The
distributed learning algorithm can accelerate the learning of
the global context. Although the cook-AD algorithm utilizes
a preprocessing method of Ô¨Çipping images that enlarges the
training set, it will increase the complexity of training data
and reduce the convergent speed.

At last the security of the proposed knowledge sharing
framework is investigated with results shown in Fig. 13. Two
scenarios with different proportions of attackers are considered
with 0.2 and 0.4 attackers, respectively. The attackers attempt
to share malicious knowledge with biased driving style indica-
tors, and affect the Ô¨Ånal learned model. It can be found from

Fig. 8: Test Gap of the Shared Knowledge

those sites with similar driving styles, and the veriÔ¨Åcation
loss value can be reduced. That is revealed by the test gap
in Fig. 8, where the three types of ICVs input their testing
images and driving style indicators to the adM, and obtain
the corresponding output control. As illustrated in the Ô¨Ågure,
the gaps of ICVs with ùëö2-type are less than ICVs with other
types, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
DAG based knowledge sharing framework. It also shows the
potentials for future autonomous driving applications, where
ICVs can exploit the model stored in the DC DAG to produce
accurate autonomous driving control.

Next, the proposed ADL is evaluated. We Ô¨Årst investigate
the proposed adaptive ADL scheme. The results of the adaptive
ADL scheme are presented in Fig, 9 in terms of loss function,
test gap and bandwidth consumption. We choose three dif-
ferent reference gaps ùëíùê∫ = 0.0156, 0.0160 and 0.0168. As
can be seen in Fig. 9 (a), all the three adaptive ADL schemes
outperform the non-adaptive ADL ones. This is due to that the
reference gap ùëíùê∫ Ô¨Ålters some ICVs with poor local models.
Only those ICVs with a local test gap ùëíùë£ > ùëíùê∫ are allowed to
upload their adMs to the RSUs, which will improve the quality
of global model. Besides, with the decrease of f ùëíùê∫, the global
loss value will be further reduced: a lower ùëíùê∫ means that the
RSUs have a better global model GadM. Thus, in order to
upload local adMs, the ICVs should also train a better CNN
model, which will promote the entire network to evolve in a
better direction. It is also noted that when the reference gap ùëíùê∫
is updated to a sufÔ¨Åciently small value, there may be no more
ICVs to upload their adMs. In this case, the global model can
be deemed as converged and optimal. In terms of test gap in
Fig. 9 (b), there is a similar trend to (a): compared to non-
adaptive scheme that enforces all ICVs to upload their adMs,
the adaptive based schemes have a smaller gap. As the output
of our CNN model is the steering value of ICVs, which is one
of the crucial parameters for autonomous driving, by utilizing
the adaptive based ADL, the RSUs can obtain a more accurate
global model to implement autonomous driving.

The results of communication cost measured by the band-
width consumption are presented in Fig. 9 (c), in which the
bandwidth consumption refers to the volume of uploading
is provided by the Mathematica
adMs. The CNN model
platform, which is consisted of two convolution layers, two
pooling layers, one linear layer, one Ô¨Çatten layer and three
ramp layer. The total network size is 120.9 MB. Since the
adaptive ADL scheme utilizes the reference gap ùëíùê∫ to control
the number of updated adMs, the consumed bandwidth will

the Ô¨Ågure that the proposed framework achieves a lower loss
value than that of the original knowledge sharing system. The
proposed one reduces the loss function value by an average
of 30%, which is mainly due to the use of DAG blockchain.
The proposed DAG blockchain system utilizes the veriÔ¨Åcation
process ùëí ‚â§ ùúñ to judge if the knowledge is legal, which can
prevent the malicious data of attackers from being appended
to the ledger.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we proposed a DAG based knowledge sharing
framework for ICVs to provide security and reliability under
dynamic and mobile vehicle networks. Built on the top of
the framework, a speciÔ¨Åc application of knowledge sharing to
autonomous driving control was investigated, wherein driving
control related models were jointly trained and shared by
ICVs. A RTH-TSA was proposed for tip selection in DAG to
achieve lightweight consensus and fast cross-region identity
authentication. Furthermore, we proposed an adaptive ADL
scheme to enhance quality of shared knowledge as well as

reducing communication cost during the learning process.
Experiment results demonstrated the efÔ¨Åciency and stability
of the proposed knowledge sharing framework. The proposed
DAG based framework reduced a 30% loss value against
malicious attacks. And the proposed adaptive ADL algorithm
is effective and efÔ¨Åcient, with more than 20% reduction in
terms of driving violation rate compared with the investigated
existing algorithms.
