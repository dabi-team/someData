example a coin can be substituted to another. In opposition to
cryptocurrencies, NFTs are uniquely identiﬁed by an id and a
set of properties, and cannot be interchangeable or divisible.
A NFT is thus the perfect way to represent anything unique
on blockchains. They can be used for several purposes, but
are often considered as digital art due to their properties.
As art, most collectors acquire NFTs for aesthetic reasons,
acquiring a social status or as a mean of investment [4].

Abstract—We are witnessing the emergence of a new digital
art market, the art market 3.0. Blockchain technology has taken
on a new sector which is still not well known, Non-Fungible
tokens (NFT). In this paper we propose a new methodology to
build a NFT Price Index that represents this new market on the
whole. In addition, this index will allow us to have a look on the
dynamics and performances of NFT markets, and to diagnose
them.

I. INTRODUCTION

the democratization
Last year has been the year of
of NFTs. The number of owners
(ﬁgure 1) and the
number of transactions (ﬁgure 2) on Ethereum have been
exponentially increasing since January 2021. Moreover,
the increasing interest of famous brand names for them
also suggests that
their adoption keeps growing. Online
marketplaces like Opensea (https://opensea.io) or LooksRare
(https://looksrare.org) have become focal points for trading
these new assets.

ETH ERC-721 or ERC-1155 NFT [1].

NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens are transferable assets
secured by a blockchain. A blockchain is an ordered list of
blocks that are linked together using cryptography. Blocks
contain data about transactions, and are validated and added
to the chain through a consensus protocol. Blockchain are
used as public transaction ledgers of most cryptocurrencies.
instance bitcoin or ethereum respectively with the
For
network Bitcoin [2] or Ethereum [3]. The need for consensus
of blockchain solves the double-spending problem using a
cryptographic proof instead of a trusted central authority.

Designed as a medium of exchange, cryptocurrencies are
transferable assets as well. Because they are deﬁned by
their value, cryptocurrencies are perfectly fungible assets, for

NFTs are created or minted by the execution of a smart
contract setting in stone the creation of tokens. Several
NFTs can be minted from the same contract, a collection is
deﬁned as a set of tokens minted from the same contract.
Tokens minted from the same contract collect remain however
perfectly identiﬁable and may differ from each others by
their id and their properties or traits. To illustrate this, we
represent ﬁgures 3 and 4 respectively the tokens CryptoPunk
#1463 and CryptoPunk #1466 of the Ethereum collection
CryptoPunk.

Besides exceptional

trade volumes, sales of NFTs have
reached record prices, sometimes up to several tens of mil-
lions of dollars [5, 6]. Record breaking sales thus suggest
a price explosion, but
the dynamics of NFT markets are
more complex. Indeed, if some top collections are steadily
becoming more and more popular and expensive, e.g. the
Ethereum CyberPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, prices of
most collections vary widely. For this reason, it is difﬁcult
to have a global vision of the NFT market. In this work,
we undertake the hedonic model to build a price index from

 
 
 
 
 
 
A. Deﬁnitions

An asset a is deﬁned by a collection C a, a token id ia
and a dictionary of traits P a. P a is a set of (trait, value)
characterizing a within its collection. P a is usually used to
quantify the scarcity of a w.r.t. other assets of C a, and,
then, to price a. Intuitively the scarcer an asset is, the more
expensive it should be. It is therefore straightforward to deal
with frequencies of traits within a collection when it comes to
build a pricing model. Given an asset a, a couple (p, v) ∈ P a,
the frequency of the value v for the trait p is deﬁned as follows:

f a
(p,v)

(cid:44) 1
|C a|

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

a(cid:48)∈Ca

(p(cid:48),v(cid:48))∈P a(cid:48)

1p(cid:48)=p1v(cid:48)=v

(1)

Since the number of traits may differ from an asset to
another, even within the same collection, we construct three
aggregate quantities: the minimum frequency f a
min (equation
2), the average frequency f a
avg (equation 3), and the maximum
frequency f a
max (equation 4). All these quantities are set equal
to 1 if P a is empty.

B. Pricing model

The pricing model that we develop in this section is the

result of three empiric observations:

• as mentioned in the introduction, the price of an asset is
impacted by the popularity and hype around its collection,
• assets within the same collection may differ from each
others by their traits, the scarcer the traits of an asset are,
the more appreciated it is in its collection,

• the NFT market seems to experience periods during
which prices of NFT are globally impacted positively or
negatively.

We ﬁnally come up with the multiplicative pricing model

of equation (5).

t = P × f (C a) × g(a) × h(t) × (cid:15)(a, t)
P a

(5)

where:

• P ∈ R+∗ deﬁnes a scale price,
• f : C → R+∗ impacts the price of an asset according to

its collection,

• g : A → R+∗ impacts the price of an asset according to

the scarcity of its traits within its collection,

• h : {0, 1, ..., T } → R+∗ impacts the prices according to

the global state of the NFT market,

thousands of NFT transaction records. Subsequent applications
presented in this study include:

• the detection of price explosion periods through statistical

tests

• the computation of the correlation matrix between the
NFT returns with the return of the cryptocurrencies
market

• the detection of undervalued and overvalued assets

The hedonic regression framework is a well known model in
Economics. Hedonic models decompose an item into its core
characteristics and study the contribution of each of them to
its value. These models are commonly used in Real Estate
Economics [7, 8]. A hedonic index is an index computed
from a ﬁtted hedonic regression model, Triplett reviews in
[9] the different methodologies that can be used. Hedonic
indices are often used as proxies of price indices, such as
consumer price indices (CPI). A price index represents the
aggregate price of a basket of items, and tracks how the
prices of these items, taken as a whole, change over time.
The hedonic methodology is particularly appraised because
it can be applied to illiquid markets. Moreover, it can even
handle the removal, replacement and addition of items over
time. For all
these reasons, several previous studies have
applied it to diagnose art markets [4, 10, 11]. Some works
also used the hedonic model to price NFTs, but focused on
a single collection: CryptoKitties [12], CryptoPunks [13] or
Decentraland [14]. To the best of our knowledge, our article
is the ﬁrst proposal of a global NFT price index.

II. METHODS

We will use the following notations:

• C is the set of collections
• A is the set of assets
• {0, 1, ..., T } is the set of sale dates
• I(a, b) (cid:44) {a, a + 1, ..., b − 1, b}
• I(b) (cid:44) I(0, b)

• (cid:15) : {0, 1, ..., T } × A → R+∗ is a noise term explaining

price ﬂuctuations.

D. Bubble Detection

The model of equation (10) is also known as the time dummy
variable version of the hedonic regression model [9]. Hedonic
coefﬁcients P , α and β are inferred only once using all dates
{0, 1, ..., T }, this approach is called the multi-period pooled
regression [9].

C. Price Index Construction

Since we used the time dummy variable method to train our
pricing model, the hedonic index I is deﬁned as follows [9]:

A bubble is often deﬁned as a period of explosive or mildly
explosive behavior in the price dynamic [15]. In particular,
autoregressive dynamics can be observed during speculative
bubbles. For this reason, unit root tests are useful for making
a market diagnosis, e.g. for detecting market excesses or
mispricing. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests are usually
used to determine whether a series y is stationary or not, but
they can also be used to detect explosive behaviors. Under
the null hypothesis H0, the process is autoregressive and has
an unit root. Under the alternative hypothesis H1, the process
has an explosive root. Hypothesis H0 is wide and must be
speciﬁed in order to derive an asymptotic distribution and the
critical values useful for the ADF test. To this end, Phillips
et al. assume that the process y is a random walk with an unit
root and an asymptotically negligible drift [16], i.e.:

y(t + 1) = d(T + 1)−η + θy(t) + (cid:15)(t)

(17)

where θ = 1, η > 1/2 and (cid:15)(t) i.i.d.∼ Normal(0, σ2).

The ADF testing procedure is applied to the regression

model of equation (18).

= A exp(γt − γ0)

Thus, the return of I between t and t + 1 is

∆y(t) = µ + νy(t − 1) +

k
(cid:88)

i=1

ψi∆y(t − i) + (cid:15)(t)

(18)

The construction of I can be justiﬁed as follows, if I is
proportional to the geometric mean of prices over all assets of
A, then:

where ∆y(t) = y(t) − y(t − 1), k ∈ N is a lag order
and (cid:15) i.i.d.∼ Normal(0, σ2). The ADF statistic is deﬁned as
the t-statistic of the coefﬁcient ν of the regression model.

Under the null hypothesis (equation 17), the process y has an
unit root, thus ν = 0. Under the alternative hypothesis of an
explosive root, ν > 0. For this reason, we use the right-sided
version of the ADF test, i.e. if ADF exceeds the critical value
: H0 is rejected and H1 accepted, else : H0 is accepted and
H1 rejected

In order to detect local bubbles and not to be fooled by
pseudo-stationary behaviors, the ADF test can be performed
on continuous sub-sample of y. We denote by ADFt1→t2 the
ADF statistic computed on {yt1, yt1+1, ..., yt2}. Phillips et al.
develop in [16] a methodology to detect multiple bubbles. For
this purpose, they derive the BSADF statistic from the ADF
statistic (equation 19).

BSDAF (t) =

sup
t(cid:48) ∈I(0,t−w)

ADFt(cid:48) →t

(19)

where w is a hyper-parameter deﬁning the minimum window
size on which ADF tests can be performed. The beginning
and the end of a bubble, denoted respectively by tb and te,
are detected as follows:

tb (cid:44) inf{t ∈ I(w, T ), BSDAF (t) > vc
te (cid:44) inf{t ∈ I(tb + δ, T ), BSDAF (t) < vc

w(t)}

w(t)}

(20)

(21)

where δ is the minimum duration of a bubble and vc
w(t)
is a critical value deﬁned as the (1 − c) quantile of the
distribution of the statistic supt(cid:48) ∈{w,...,t} ADF0→t(cid:48) . Critical
values vc
w(t) can be estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations.

III. DATA
Several blockchains support NFTs including Ethereum,
Solana, Flow, Tezos or Polygon. However, most of the NFT
trade volume is concentrated on Ethereum (ﬁgure 5). For
this reason, we decide to focus our work on Ethereum NFT
collections, more precisely on NFTs satisfying the standard
ERC-721.

We use the ofﬁcial Opensea API (https://docs.opensea.io)
to download the properties of all
tokens in the selected
collections, as well as all sale transactions concerning these
collections from the 1st June 2021 to the 15th January 2022.
Our dataset totals up 597198 transactions.

IV. MATERIALS AND APPLICATIONS

In order to train the model of equation (18) we use the
Huber Regressor, a linear regression model that is robust to
outliers. We train two models: a model with all collected
collections in order to build the NFT price index, and another
model with only metaverse-related collections to build the
metaverse price index. Collections used for both indices can
be found in the appendix (section VII-B). The ﬁrst value of
our indices, i.e. the hyper-parameter A, is set equal to 100.
We report on table I the inferred parameters β of g, the asset
rarity impact function, for the NFT price index.

We plot in ﬁgures 6 and 7 the 7-day moving averages of
the NFT and Metaverse Index respectively. Raw indices can be
found in the appendix (section VII-A). We also plot in ﬁgures 6
and 7 the Google Trends (GT) signals for the queries ”nft” and
”metaverse” between the 1st June 2021 and the 16th January
2022 [18, 19]. Since the GT signals for q is proportional to
the Google search volume for q, both GT signals will be used
to chart the fad for NFTs and the metaverse.

equal to 40. We use the methodology of Phillips et al. pre-
sented in section II-D to detect the start and the end of bubbles.

w(t) of supt(cid:48) ∈I(w,t) ADF0→t(cid:48) are estimated
using Monte-Carlo simulations of NM C = 5000 random walks

set η = σ = d = 1. vc
w(t) are estimated for t ∈ I(w, T ). We
report in particular the 90%, 95% and 99% critical values
when t = T = 230 in table IV. We plot on ﬁgures 8 and 9 the
t → BSADF (t) signals (equation (19)) computed for both
indices. We have also plotted the 95% and 99% critical value
signal for the statistics t → supt(cid:48) ∈I(w,t) ADF0→t(cid:48) . We recall
that an explosive behavior is detected in the price dynamic if
the BSADF statistic exceeds the 99% critical value signal.

C. Undervalued and Overvalued Assets

Once the parameters P , α, β, γ and σ of equation (10) are
inferred after a training phase, any asset a can be priced at
time t ∈ {0, ..., T } if at least one asset of the same collection
has been used during the training phase. According to the
model of equation (10), the log-price of a at time t follows the
distribution Normal(log ¯P a
is computed as
follows:

t , σ2) where log ¯P a

t

• pover + punder = 1,
t = ¯P a
• at P a
• punder

t , pover(P a

t ) = punder(P a

t ) = 1
2 ,

is strictly increasing,

lim0+ punder = 1 and

lim∞ punder = 0.

The simplest investment strategy could consist in investing
at time t in an asset a for which the listing price P a
t gives a
high undersold probability punder(P a
t ) below 1/2, and listing
it at ¯P a
t . One problem, however, is that equation (22) assumes
to have estimated γt, i.e. the market impact coefﬁcient of
today. To deal with it, γt can be estimated using earlier in
the day transactions, or it can be approximated by a moving
average of the market impact coefﬁcients over recent previous
days.

V. DISCUSSION

From ﬁgures 6 and 7, we detect a strong upward trend
for both price indices indicating a global price rise. This
increase in prices appears to follow the rising interest for
both themes. The NFT price index seems to have experienced
several brief explosive periods, while the metaverse price
index experienced an unique explosive period beginning in
November 2021. This comes a short time after the renaming
of Facebook’s parent company to Meta reveiling their interest
for the metaverse.

As shown in table I,

the parameters of g are all non
positive. As a consequence, g, and then the price, is strictly

decreasing with the quantities fmin, favg and fmax.
It
statistically conﬁrms our intuition that scarcer assets are more
expensive.

VI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We would like to thank Opensea for providing us an API

key to collect all the necessary data to conduct this study.

According to table II, returns of both indices are positively
correlated with the returns of the top-tier cryptocurrencies
BTC, ETH and SOL, but correlation coefﬁcients remain
relatively small compared to the ones between BTC, ETH
and SOL. From table III, we observe that
the selected
collections have, on the whole, dramatically outperformed
these cryptocurrencies. Putting these results together suggests
that blue ship NFTs have, taken as a whole, offered both-
crypto-and-NFT investors high returns while diversifying
their risk.

According to ﬁgure 8, only a brief bubble has been detected
by the presented methodology. Thus, the NFT price index
has globally never experienced any explosive price dynamic,
but it doesn’t mean that some collections have not. Indeed,
as shown in ﬁgure 8, a bubble has been detected in the
metaverse index between the 2. November 2021 and the 2.
December 2021 following the renaming of Facebook.

Concerning our methodology, two weaknesses have been
identiﬁed. First, the selection of collections is highly subjective
and includes a look-ahead bias. Secondly, hedonic coefﬁcients
α and β are hold ﬁxed over time, thus, our model can not
take into account the time varying popularity of collections
to explain price dynamics. Both of these problems could
be solved by implementing a quantitative rule to update the
collection set on a regular basis, and, by using the adjacent
dummy variable method [9], an alternative training procedure
for the time dummy variable hedonic model. It could also be
interesting in a future work to consider the temporal depen-
dence of the trends according to the collections, or to detect
NFT market regimes. Finally, it would also be appropriate to
test and compare other bubble detection models.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have proposed a methodology to construct
price indices for the NFT markets. In contrary to previous
works, our indices aggregate transactions from varied collec-
tions, this allows us to better represent this new art market 3.0.
These indices have allowed us to analyse the dynamics and
performances of NFT markets, and to perform diagnostic tests.
In particular, we have used statistical tests to detect speculative
bubbles. Finally, we have demonstrated that simple intuitive
investment strategies could be derived from the pricing model
used for the contruction of our indices.
