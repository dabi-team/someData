This paper presents an analysis of the role of social media, speci￿cally Twitter, in the context of non-fungible tokens, better known as

NFTs. Such emerging technology framing the creation and exchange of digital object, started years ago with early projects such as

"CryptoPunks" and since early 2021, has received an increasing interest by a community of people creating, buying, selling NFTs

and by the media reporting to the general public. In this work it is shown how the landscape of one class of projects, speci￿cally

those used as social media pro￿le pictures, has become mainstream with leading projects such as "Bored Ape Yacht Club", "Cool

Cats" and "Doodles". This work illustrates how heterogeneous data was collected from the Ethereum blockchain and Twitter and then

analysed using algorithms and state-of-art metrics related to graphs. The initial results show that from a social network perspective,

the collections of most popular NFTs can be considered as a single community around NFTs. Thus, while each project has its own

value and volume of exchange, on a social level all of them are primarily in￿uenced by the evolution of values and trades of "Bored

Ape Yacht Club" collection.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a booming technology, with a trading volume that - in just one year - has increased

from $150 million to over $5 billion (recorded in January 2022 by considering only the transactions that took place on

the Ethereum blockchain [2] through the main exchange platform OpenSea) [19]. Public attention towards NFTs has

exploded since the beginning of 2021, when the NFT market experienced record sales and exchange volumes, up to

the present day where individual pieces for some projects have reached prices of millions of dollars and have been

purchased by a number of celebrities. However, little is known about the overall structure and evolution of the NFT

ecosystem, or how this phenomenon has also grown thanks to the communities that have formed in social networks,

such as Twitter. In a simplistic way, we can de￿ne an NFT as a unique digital asset whose information (such as features,

traits and ownership) is certi￿ed and managed using blockchain technology. In other words, we can think of a NFT

project as a set of football player cards. Each card of the set is di￿erent from the others because of some speci￿c traits

(e.g., a player can be more or less wanted), the circulation of each card is ￿xed, and the owner of each card is known

and traceable. The set of cards is managed on the blockchain by means of a smart contract, while each card represents

an indivisible token. More speci￿cally, NFTs are an example of a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) application that

renders trustworthy intermediaries such as banks and notary ￿rms obsolete [24]. In fact, cryptographic tokens based

on DLTs, through guaranteed enforcement of encoded obligations (e.g., through smart contracts), can combine both

concepts of (i) access rights to an underlying economic value (property) [5, 13], and (ii) a permission to access someone

else’s property or services or a collective good. NFTs and their technology are already being used in a number of varied

￿elds. Some examples include: the certi￿cation of digital generative artworks, the representation and management of

land and objects ownership in the metaverse, and the certi￿cation of ownership of a pro￿le image in social networks,

such as Twitter. It is this latter use case of pro￿le picture images (PFPs) that has been one of the largest contributors to

the popularity of NFT technology during the past year. There have been digital ￿gurine projects whose cards were

previously trading for a few hundred dollars in early 2021 and whose average price today is in the hundreds of thousands

of dollars. Leaving aside the purely economic aspect, this phenomenon of using NFTs as pro￿le pictures has both

social and technological interest that, in our opinion, are worth researching deeper. In fact, the use of pro￿le pictures

belonging to a digital collection with a limited circulation (typically 10,000 di￿erent ￿gurines) and whose ownership

is certi￿ed by a distributed ledger, introduces some entirely new and disruptive concepts. First of all, those who use

a pro￿le picture, with no apparent relation to their own photo, seek to eliminate stereotypes and preconceptions by

hiding themselves in a sort of anonymity typical of the crypto world; moreover, it allows the user the ability to create

a digital persona (that may or may not have any relation to their real identity from which their subconscious may

wish to escape) [26]. Second, the fact of having a limited number of cards (a limit forced by construction by the smart

contract written on blockchain) provides the possession of some of them (such as the CryptoPunks and Bored Ape

Yacht Club) with real digital status symbols that allow the owner to highlight the fact that she or he has been a person

in the crypto world for a long time or economically successful. Third, the owner of a ￿gurine in a particular project can

sometimes enjoy digital or real bene￿ts: such as being able to access restricted discussion rooms in social networks like

Discord, or take part real world or metaverse special events and parties. This allows a union of real and digital worlds

where the concept of ownership is easily transportable and usable, without requiring going through intermediaries.

From the personal experience of the authors of this work, Twitter and Discord represent the two most representative

and used social networks for people interested in NFTs of the PFPs type, where real communities have been created.

This work, the ￿rst of its kind, aims to analyze the activity of the most PFPs in the Twitter ecosystem: which turns

out to be both the main communication channel of these communities and the one most easily analyzed thanks to its

content query API. In this paper we wanted to apply state of art social network analysis (SNA) techniques to analyze

these communities and verify how they interact and drive the NFTs market and how they are interconnected. SNA

techniques are in fact widely used in application areas such as community and topic detection [6]. In this paper we

took 18 most signi￿cant NFT pro￿le pictures projects and collected all their blockhain transactions and all their related

tweets starting from the date of creation to April 15th, 2022. Next, we analyzed the data obtained from Twitter by

creating two di￿erent kind of graphs: one related to tweets with commonalities between each project pair and a second

related to tweets having common hashtags. We then analyzed which communities are the most in￿uential in this

ecosystem and how they interact with each other. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of

SNA techniques available in literature. Next, Section 3 discusses which projects have been selected for this work, the

rationale for choosing them among others and how the data were collected from Twitter and the Ethereum blockchain.

Next, Section 4 presents which SNA analyses have been conducted and the results obtained. Finally, Section Section 5

concludes this paper by providing future research insights.

2 STATE OF ART

Over the past decades, social media data have been studied to understand people [1, 3] and exploited to develop

strategies for promotion, prediction and engagement in di￿erent ￿elds [8, 11, 25]. A growing body of existing research

has analysed the dissemination of information online, investigating how buying products or joining communities

is a￿ected by the mechanics of social networks [20]. A considerable amount of work in this area has been done on

sentiment analysis and opinion mining using Twitter. This is due to the fact that Twitter data is mostly composed of

text, i.e. tweets. Twitter is largely popular for its institutional role of showing news and reports, but also renowned

as the medium where users freely share their true feelings, write what they are doing and discuss a wide range of

topics, which include places, people and products [11]. The purpose of sentiment analysis, thus, is to understand a

user’s opinions and attitudes about di￿erent topics through the texts they have written [15]. Even if generally the

understanding of communities in social network is performed through sentiment analysis and text mining [15], in

this work we will focus on Social Network Analysis (SNA). In social networks, di￿erent mechanisms generate various

structures such as friendship networks, mention networks, hashtag networks, etc. Generally, Twitter users use hashtags

to add context and metadata to tweets making twitter more expressive [20]. Hashtags, indeed, provide a way to search

for any kind of content posted by any kind of user, e.g. personal feelings, public criticism, nonsense messages, important

updates [11]. Based on these, it is possible to create hashtag networks in Twitter by converting the co-occurrences of

these tags in a single tweet into links. In several cases, these types of networks exhibit the same universal properties

as real networks, such as the small-world property, clustering and power-law distributions [11, 21]. The majority of

research in this context focuses on the dissemination of information and the analysis of the networks of interactions

formed among users around di￿erent topics, such as popular television broadcasts [11], health care [14], COVID-19

pandemics [10]. This kind of study relates to the SNA that govern the relationships between NFTs, their creators and

their collectors as described in [23] where the auction dynamics of NFTs, links between artists and collectors and

co-bidding networks were studied, concluding strong evidence of ￿rst-mover advantage. Other studies were conducted

using data obtained from DLT or marketplaces. In the context of NFTs transacions, the study of how di￿erent wallets

interact was performed in [7] In this study, an attempt was made to identify the wallets that most in￿uence trades

using graph-based analysis techniques. Preliminary studies between the relationship between the average price of

tokens in an NFT collection and twitter trends was analysed in [17] and [18]. Both works applied learning techniques

to predict the future price of assets. Although the datasets considered are in both cases limited and restricted to speci￿c

NFT collections, it is possible to conclude that social activity may be a very important feature to predict over time the

collection price.

3 PROJECTS SELECTION AND DATA COLLECTION

For this study, we selected 18 di￿erent pro￿le picture NFTs projects that, following our experience in the ￿eld, we found

to be signi￿cant each one for a speci￿c reason. These projects are illustrated in Table 1 where reported for each one are:

the publishing date of the smart contract on the blockchain (also called deployment date), the Ethereum address of

the smart contract, the o￿cial Twitter account, and the list of hashtags that we identi￿ed as the ones most used by

the respective Twitter community. CryptoPunks (Figure 1a) are commonly regarded as the originators of PFP projects:

they were launched in June 2017 and consist of 10,000 punks that are all di￿erent and pixelized. The community is
3

ACM GoodIT ’22, September 07–09, 2022, Cyprus

Casale-Brunet, et al.

predominantly composed of people who have been in the crypto scene for a long time (referred to in the crypto slang as

OGs). We included The HashMasks (Figure 1b), while considered more ￿ne-art than PFP, because they are a prototypical

collection launched just before the so-called NFT bull run of 2021-2022. This collection introduced the centrality of

the concept of traits and rarity in each image. This concept was then the basis for all the projects we analyzed in this

paper. We considered projects that became very famous such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (Figure 1c), further referred

as BAYC that are now considered as a status symbol, projects that were born in the same period such as the Crypto

Hodlers (Figure 1f) that struggled to expand their social community, projects like the mfers (Figure 1p), created by a

long-time crypto investor and Twitter in￿uencer Sartoshi, that has been the forerunner of the usage of the CC0 licence

and meme culture. In general, we tried to enclose in this selection all those projects that introduced speci￿c innovations

or because their overall volume of tweets and transactions is representative for the study. It is important to point out

that this list does not represent any kind of ￿nancial advice in any way.

3.1 Blockchain data

The data saved on blockchain, which are public and accessible to all by construction of the Ethereum blockchain, are

e￿ciently accessed when structured in formats such as SQL [4]. For this reason, for the analysis presented in this

paper we made use of Google BigQuery which structures this data in an SQL database and provides a very e￿cient

access API [16]. This method of analysis has already been presented in [7] and will be referred to for more technical

details about the data extraction techniques used. Brie￿y, for each transaction we stored the hash of the transaction, the

address of the NFT smart contract, the addresses of the wallet(s) or smart contract(s) that sold and purchased an NFT

token, the Ethereum block time as milliseconds from the UNIX epoch, the Ethereum block number, the value of ETH

and/or WETH (Wrapped ETH) transferred and the number of tokens exchanged during the transaction (can be more

than one). Gas fees (i.e., transaction costs) were excluded from the analysis; if the exchange currency is neither ETH

nor WETH the transaction was seen as a simple transfer (seen that the vast majority of the transactions happen in

ETH or WETH, we concluded that this assumption still produces reasonable estimates of the exchange volumes while

signi￿cantly reducing the complexity of the queries used). Whenever more than one token was exchanged in the same

transaction, the individual price of each token was considered the same, and computed by splitting the total amount of

the transaction into equal parts. For each NFT collection, data was extracted from the date of their creation to April 15th,

2022. It must be noted that unlike what was done in [7] where only transactions involving Externally-owed-Accounts

(EoAs) were considered, for this work also transactions involving Contract Accounts (CAs) have been considered.

In order to eliminate suspicious transactions (e.g., attributable to money laundering activities), for each project we

eliminated transactions above the 95th percentile and those where the buyer and seller address are exactly the same.

Moreover, only for the Meebits collection we decided to neglect all the transactions made on the LooksRare marketplace

because we judged the majority of transactions made within this platform as suspicious: as an example, in mid-January

2021 there were sales of some tokens for millions of dollars each, when the average value traded in the days before

was in the tens of thousands of dollars [12]. In Table 2 one can ￿nd for each project the number of both Ethereum

transactions analysed from each project smart contract deployment date, till April 15th, 2022. The value in USD was

calculated using the close spot price value relative to the day of the transaction, and the price provided by [9] has been

used. The total number of transactions acquired and analysed in this work is 393,210.

3.2 Twi￿er data

The method that we used to collect tweets from Twitter has been going through the o￿cial Search Tweets API [22]. For

research purposes, this API allows to programmatically access public tweets from the complete archive dating back to

the ￿rst Tweet in March 2006, using speci￿c search queries. For each tweet we stored the tweet time as milliseconds

from the UNIX epoch, the unique tweet identi￿er generated by Twitter, the tweet text, the number of replies, likes

and retweet count at the time of the query, the list of hashtags used on the tweet, and the unique Twitter username of

the author of the tweet. For each project, we queried the API by providing as search points the project o￿cial twitter

account and speci￿c hashtags used by the project social community (see Table 1). For the scope of this work, only

English-language tweets have been collected. In Table 2 one can ￿nd for each project the number of tweets from the

￿rst tweet found by the query till April 15th, 2022. The total number of tweets acquired and analysed in this work is

7,747,078.

4 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

4.1 Ethereum wallets and Twi￿er users

The NFT market has seen exponential growth from January 2021 to the present both in terms of volumes traded and

users who have purchased at least one NFT [2]. As the ￿rst analysis, we analysed the growth that occurred on this

ecosystem in terms of number of transactions and tweets, and in terms of number of unique Twitter users and Ethereum

wallets who participated in the various project communities. The data reported in Table 2, and summarized in Figure 2,

shows how in one year the PFP interest on Twitter went from 50 daily tweets in the beginning of January 2021 to more

than 50,000 daily tweets in mid April 2022 by considering only the 18 selected projects. In the same period the number

of daily unique Twitter users passed from 50 to more than 20,000 with a peak of 60,000, onboarding during the whole

period more than 1 million unique active users. Interestingly, from Figure 2 (c) and (d) both the new and cumulative

Twitter users and Ethereum wallets follow the same trend: this means that owning one of these NFTs implies therefore

also participating in social activity on Twitter.

4.2 The communities

In order to identify the interactions and connections that were formed across the communities of each project, we

performed as a ￿rst analysis one that aimed to identify common Twitter users and Etehereum wallets. For each collection

we de￿ned: (i) the list of Twitter users who have posted at least one tweet attributable to a collection (i.e., mentioning

the o￿cial account, or using one of the hashtags de￿ned in Table 1), (ii) the list of Ethereum wallets that have purchased

at least one of the tokens in the collection. Figure 3a depicts a matrix showing for each cell

the number of common

Twitter users between the project shown in the i-row and the one shown in the j-column. The matrix can be read

8, 9

(

)

row by row: for each row i, the total number of users is given by the cell on the diagonal (i,i), the cells on the i-th

row are then normalized to this. Similarly, it can be read column by column. The same considerations can be made

when considering the Ethereum wallets that are illustrated in Figure 3b. From both of these ￿gures we can see that

the projects that dominate in terms of Twitter users and Ethereum wallets are the CryptoPunks, BAYC, Cool Cats,

Gutter Cat, World of Women, and Doodles. A second type of analysis that we performed was to analyze the tweets in

common between pairs of projects and represent this information as an undirected weighted graph. The graph was

constructed by de￿ning a node for each project and de￿ning a weighted arc between projects where the weight. As the

weight of each node was assigned the number of tweets and as the weight of each arc the number of common tweets

(i.e., counting the number of tweets that concern the two projects at the same time). The resulting graph is shown in

Figure 4a, while the structural statistics of the graph are summarized in Table 3a. The graph consists of 18 nodes (the

number of projects), and 153 arcs in a single connected component. All the nodes are connected with the remaining

17 (see average degree, transitivity and edge density): this indicates how the social community, although polarized

toward a few projects, is highly connected (i.e. average clustering equal to 1). For this reason, modularity is equal to 0,

i.e. having a single cluster there is no di￿erence among edges within groups and edges expected on the basis of chance

[11]. We successively performed a pagerank analysis to identify which nodes were the most in￿uential: results are

reported in Figure 5b and we can see that the most in￿uential ones are BAYC, CryptoPunks, Cool Cats, Gutter Cat,

World of Women, and Doodles. These are the same ones that were identi￿ed in the previous analysis and, as can also

be seen from Figure 6a, also the ones with the highest number of associated tweets. For each project we then tried to

identify commonality with the others by going to identify the heaviest graph arcs. In other words, for each project we

identi￿ed the three most related by going for the ones with the most tweets in common. Table 3b summarises these

results: you can see that the BAYC are most often present and most connected with the other projects.

As a further point of analysis, we focused on hashtags and how they are used in tweets. The hashtags - that are
words preceded by the # symbol such as #NFT - are in fact the most common method used by Twitter users to create

speci￿c groups and streams of communication. We identi￿ed 60,060 di￿erent hashtags and thus constructed a weighted

undirected graph where: each node represents a hashtag and each connection between two nodes represents the

presence of a tweet in which both corresponding hashtags were used. As the weight of each node was assigned the

number of tweets in which the corresponding hashtag was present, and as the weights of each connection the number

of tweets having the two corresponding hashtags in common. Figure 6a illustrates in descending order which are the
20 most used hashtags: NFT, cryptopunks, and BAYC are the most signi￿cant ones. Beyond the 20th, namely art, the
weights are much lower. Overall, the properties of the graph thus formed are shown in Table 3a: the graph consists

of 762,950 connections, with an average weight of about 29,634 common tweets. The average clustering coe￿cient

and the relatively signi￿cant number of connected components (that is 439) suggest the presence of highly specialized

communities within this content graph. However, edge density is extremely low in this case, being hashtags mainly

connected with some central hashtags (see below). Most likely for this reason, modularity has a low value. While

Figure 6b illustrates in descending order which are the 20 hashtags with highest pagerank. Again, the values beyond
the 20-th (famorie, related to the CryptoMories) the weight is much lower. Figure 4b illustrates the graph taking into
account only these 20 hashtags, where the size of the nodes is proportional to the pagerank: again, as can be observed,
the hashtags NFT, cryptopunks and BAYC are the most in￿uential. We also performed a commonality analysis for the
hashtags: this was summarized in Table 3c. As can be observed, the NFT hashtag is the one that is most common to all.

Casale-Brunet, et al.

The hashtags nftart, nftartist, and nftcollection are neither close to cryptopunks nor BAYC: this indicates how for more

generic topics, and not only related to PFP, the discourses are less polarized on cryptopunks and BAYC.

4.4 The role of the social network community

Figure 7 shows trends in volume, average price, tweets, and users (wallets and Twitter accounts) for a number of very

di￿erent projects from the date of creation until April 14, 2022. BAYC, CryptoHodlers, Mekaverse, and mfers were

considered. As can be seen, the BAYC built up a continuous engagement on Twitter where within a year the number of

unique users talking about them grew exponentially, as did the average price, which went from 0.08ETH to more than

100ETH in less than a year. There are projects, such as CryptoHodlers, on the other hand, where although the creators

try to build an ecosystem around their project by distributing comics or developing a new reserved NFT, the community

has not grown, impacting the average price and liquidity (in terms of daily trades) of this project. Mekaverse and mfers,

summarize these concepts: for the former we see how a high number of tweets in the early stages of the project resulted

in an initial high exchange value where the ￿gurines traded for a minimum price of 8ETH, then went to 10 times less

as the number of tweets dropped. For the latter, on the other hand, we see that engagement in terms of daily tweets

coincides with an increase in average price, and this occurs gradually and constantly after their release.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The NFT phenomenon is a topic that became mainstream during 2021 and has continued to receive increasing attention

from early 2022 to the present. This blockchain-based technology has also come to the forefront thanks to projects such

as BAYCs whose images have been purchased by celebrities and traded at very high prices as reported by several media.

In this paper, we analyzed the phenomenon of NFTs, focusing on the class related to PFPs. We chose 18 projects based

on our knowledge in the ￿eld and based on their importance in terms of volumes traded, users, and social activity. It

was illustrated through analysis of social activity how the concept of social community is essential to ensure liquidity

and value of PFP projects, i.e., used as social icons. The centrality and in￿uence of the community related to BAYCs was

demonstrated, that despite being second to CryptoPunks in terms of volumes traded, social activity is much higher and

central to every other project in the industry. This work aimed to lay the groundwork for more in-depth future studies

on understanding whether patterns and causality conditions may exist between elements such as the number of tweets,

average price of a collection, Twitter users, and Ethereum wallet.
