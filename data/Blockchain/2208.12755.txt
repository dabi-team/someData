Abstract. The number of internet-connected devices has been exponen-
tially growing with the massive volume of heterogeneous data generated
from various devices, resulting in a highly intertwined cyber-physical sys-
tem. Currently, the Edge Intelligence System (EIS) concept that lever-
ages the merits of edge computing and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is uti-
lized to provide smart cloud services with powerful computational pro-
cessing and reduce decision-making delays. Thus, EIS oﬀers a possible
solution to realizing future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), es-
pecially in a vehicular network framework. However, since the central
aggregator server is responsible for supervising the entire system orches-
tration, the existing EIS framework faces several challenges and is still
potentially susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. Hence, to solve the
issues mentioned earlier, this paper presents the notion of secure edge in-
telligence, merging the beneﬁts of Federated Learning (FL), blockchain,
and Local Diﬀerential Privacy (LDP). The blockchain-assisted FL ap-
proach is used to eﬃciently improve traﬃc prediction accuracy and en-
hance user privacy and security by recording transactions in immutable
distributed ledger networks as well as providing a decentralized reward
mechanism system. Furthermore, LDP is empowered to strengthen the
conﬁdentiality of data sharing transactions, especially in protecting the
user’s private data from various attacks. The proposed framework has
been implemented in two scenarios, i.e., blockchain-based FL to eﬃ-
ciently develop the decentralized traﬃc management for vehicular net-
works and LDP-based FL to produce the randomized privacy protection
using the IBM Library for diﬀerential privacy.

Introduction

Recently, the number of internet-connected devices has been exponentially grow-
ing with great potential utilization in myriad applications, such as Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) [29], smart grids [25], smart healthcare [22], and
smart industry [2]. It is followed by the massive volume of heterogeneous data
generated from various devices, resulting in a highly intertwined cyber-physical
system. In terms of ITS, the concept of edge intelligence [28] system (EIS),
which leverages the merits of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and artiﬁcial in-
telligence (AI) technology, has been widely deployed to form the next generation
of vehicular networks (VNs). MEC oﬀers real-time communications with high
bandwidth and low latency by locating the computing and processing infrastruc-
ture close to the end-user in the edge network. On the other hand, AI provides
smart cloud services with high performance and reduces decision-making delays
[5]. Thus, EIS is designed to manage intelligent resource orchestration, enable
self-aggregating communication systems, oﬀer powerful computational process-
ing, and reduce decision-making delay by leveraging edge resources on local edge
networks [30].

Nevertheless, the traditional AI technique, such as machine learning, suf-
fers from severe privacy leakage risk by centralizing and aggregating the user’s
training data containing private information on a centralized server. Federated
learning (FL) as a decentralized machine learning paradigm has lately developed
to address the privacy challenges by allowing mobile devices (e.g., vehicles) to
collaboratively perform AI training without giving raw data containing the user’s
private information to the central aggregator [11]. The FL approach allows the
users to perform a local training model that never leaves their own devices. In
this sense, the user’s raw data is only used to train and update a current global
model and send an updated model to the central aggregator in each iteration.
Then, the central aggregator generates a new global model by aggregating these
updated and trained models gathered from the participated users to be used in
the next iteration. This process is repeated in multiple iterations until the global
model achieves a particular accuracy [1].

Although FL brings several advantages for edge intelligence systems, the ex-
isting FL framework still potentially experiences various adversarial attacks, such
as membership inference and poisoning attacks [20]. Here, in the membership
inference attack, attackers might perform reverse engineering to gather user’s
private data by leveraging the updated model training, whereas a poisoning at-
tack aims to aﬀect the global model by sending the malicious updated models
during the collaborative training phase. Furthermore, the central aggregator that
is responsible for managing the whole system orchestration has trouble address-
ing crucial challenges associated with a Single Point of Failure (SPoF) issue,
which may result in the whole FL system failure and lead to the risk of exposing

private data. As a result, the users might be hesitant to participate in improving
FL-based edge intelligence systems for VNs.

In order to address the above challenges, this paper presents the notion
of secure edge intelligence, merging the beneﬁts of Federated Learning (FL),
blockchain, and Local Diﬀerential Privacy (LDP). The blockchain-assisted FL
approach is used to enhance user privacy and security by recording transactions
in immutable distributed ledger networks as well as improving an eﬃcient traf-
ﬁc prediction accuracy in a decentralized manner. Moreover, blockchain can be
deployed as an incentive mechanism to motivate the users to enhance the global
model using their local data collaboratively. We also consider empowering the
LDP technique to guarantee the conﬁdentiality of the local training model by
shielding the user’s data from malicious attackers. Thus, LDP supports height-
ening the edge intelligence’s data sharing transactions protection in VNs.

The structure of this paper is arranged as follows: we explain the back-
ground knowledge related to edge intelligence technology components in Section
2. Then, section 3 explains the related works. Next, Section 4 presents our pro-
posed model, a secure edge intelligence on VNs. We discuss numerical results in
Section 5. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.

2 Background

2.1 Distributed Ledger Technology

Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto [18], blockchain
has lately been earning attention from industry researchers and academia to de-
velop decentralized and secure systems for various use cases. Blockchain can be
utilized to address the bottleneck of a centralized server. It is an open database
that supports anonymous and trustworthy transactions in ensuring data security
without requiring any intermediaries. Here, all transactions are marked with a

timestamp and recorded into a decentralized ledger where no single authority
can endorse events secretly. Blockchain-enabled implementations generally take
advantage of the SPoF feature with various consensuses mechanisms that vali-
date and store veriﬁed transactions. Figure 1 shows the illustration of blockchain
structure, Figure 1 shows the illustration of blockchain structure. The block is
fundamentally composed of two parts, i.e., the block header, which contains
information such as block number, previous hash block, Merkle tree root [21],
timestamp, etc., and the block body includes the number of user’s transactions
in the blockchain network.

2.2 Federated Learning

The standard machine learning techniques utilize the training data to train the
models by centralizing and aggregating the user’s training data containing pri-
vate information on a centralized server. Nevertheless, these approaches suﬀer
from severe privacy risks, such as the potential of sensitive data leakage, the risk
of SPoF, and enormous overhead in collecting and storing the training data. In
order to address these issues, Google introduced federated learning as a promis-
ing method that permits distributed mobile devices to collaboratively train the
models without centralizing the training data and keeps the local data stored
on mobile devices. As the user participants, each mobile device downloads the
global model from a model provider (i.e., the central server), generates the model
update by training the current global model using their local data, and then up-
loads them to the aggregator server. Then, as an aggregator server, the central
server gathers and aggregates all the model updates from the user participants
to produces a new global model for the next iteration. Thus, FL signiﬁcantly
enhances mobile device privacy by blocking some attacks for straightforward ac-
cess to the local training data [30]. Further, in the context of VNs, the federated
learning method can be utilized to train prediction models without straightfor-
ward access to the private data on the vehicles, which protects the data privacy
of vehicles and improves traﬃc prediction accuracy [14].

Basically, FL aims to facilitate the training model collaboration among par-
ticipants without conveying their private data; thus, the private or conﬁdential
data is kept and never leaves their devices [9]. The FL strives to optimize a global
loss function F (w) through an FL optimization objective that can be calculated
using the empirical risk minimization approach in Equation 1,

where w, m, pk, and Fk(w), is notation for model parameters, number of
devices, number of data points of device k compared to total number of data
points, and loss function of device k, respectively.

2.3 Diﬀerential Privacy

Diﬀerential privacy (DP) [6] has received much attention as a solution to the
privacy-preserving challenges in machine learning [19]. By including random
noise, such as Gaussian or Laplacian noise distribution, DP oﬀers a signiﬁcant
standard for data privacy protection. The participants manage the degree of pri-
vacy budget ((cid:15)) that deﬁnes the number of noises added. Below is a description
of the formal deﬁnition of DP [6].
“A randomized mechanism M provides ((cid:15), δ)- diﬀerential privacy if for any two
neighboring database D1 and D2 that diﬀer in only a single entry, ∀S ⊆ Range(M ),

P r(M (D1) ∈ S) ≤ e(cid:15)P r(M (D2) ∈ S) + δ

(2)

if δ = 0, M is said to achieve (cid:15)-diﬀerential privacy.
In order to permit a slight possibility of failure, the term δ is denoted. The
less value of (cid:15) (i.e., more additional noise) yields a better level of privacy, while
the increased value of (cid:15) generates a lower level of privacy, according to equation
2.

3 Related Work

An edge computing (EC) network extends the notion of cloud computing con-
cept to perform its capability to the network’s edge. The main aims of EC are
almost similar to cloudlets or fog computing in other references. Moreover, EC
oﬀers data storage, and computational processing is locally performed in the
edge infrastructure to be closer to the data provider or user. As a result, edge
computing oﬀers real-time services, location-aware, and low-latency communica-
tion. Further, it also reduces delay and saves the bandwidth of transferring data
for the remote node in the vehicular network system. Moreover, current eﬀorts
utilized FL to improve the usability of MEC in reaching edge intelligence systems
for wireless networks. In [23], the authors explored an FL model over wireless
networks to improve FL’s activities utilizing a control algorithm approach by
respecting energy consumption as well as communication and computation la-
tency. The authors in [3] focus on improving system performance and solving
the FL loss function problem during the training phase by optimizing resource
allocation and user selection mechanisms. Further, the authors in [17] deployed
FL to form collaborative edge intelligence in mitigation situations of vehicular
cyber-physical systems for detecting data leakage and protecting user’s privacy
information.

Blockchain as a distributed ledger technology is suggested to address the
weakness of a traditional data management system in VNs. In the FL-based EIS,
blockchain can be used to provide a decentralized incentive mechanism, verify the
trustworthiness of the updated model training, and support a fair global model’s
aggregation. Lately, some research has oﬀered to merge FL and blockchain to
strengthen privacy. In [16], the authors suggested a privacy-preserving data shar-
ing mechanism in industrial IoT for a distributed multi-parties scenario. They

6

M. Firdaus and K.H. Rhee

integrate the consensus mechanism of permissioned blockchain with FL. Mean-
while, the work from [15] designed the framework to refuse dishonest users from
the FL system by automatically enforcing smart contracts to defy model or data
poisoning attacks. Furthermore, the authors in [27] proposed the DeepChain pro-
tocol that employs a blockchain-based incentive mechanism to provide a secure,
auditable, fair, and distributed deep learning system. Here, the incentive is uti-
lized to force participants to act rightly and substitute a centralized approach’s
drawbacks.

In order to guarantee the conﬁdentiality of the local training model from ma-
licious attackers, some study concentrates on employing diﬀerential privacy for
users’ data privacy protection. In [24], the authors proposed a hybrid approach to
tackle the problem of inference attacks and provide privacy-preserving federated
learning using diﬀerential privacy and secure multi-party computation (SMPC).
This approach aims to address the FL challenges, such as inference attacks and
lack of accuracy, as well as recede the enlargement of noise injection when the
number of users rises in diverse use cases and applications. Further, the study
in [26] proposed the NbAFL framework to evade data leakage using a diﬀeren-
tial privacy technique by adding noise before FL model aggregation. This study
focuses on solving the information leakage in the distributed stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) based FL and develops a theoretical convergence bound for the
trained FL model’s loss function.

4 Towards Secure Edge Intelligence

As illustrated in Figure 2, we propose the joint framework by leveraging the
advantages of FL, LDP, and blockchain technology to form a secure edge intel-
ligence in VNs. We use the blockchain to enhance the privacy and security of
model parameters in the edge resource of federated learning by encrypting the
data with a particular cryptography technique. Moreover, blockchain as a dis-
tributed ledger technology eﬀectively overcame a centralized server’s drawbacks
and handled the uploaded parameters of updated models transparently. Fur-
thermore, LDP is empowered to strengthen the conﬁdentiality of transactions,
primarily in defending the sensitive or private user’s data on the trained local
model uploading process.

In this architecture, vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) are the primary
nodes, act as the user’s participants and aggregator server, respectively. They
communicate with each other by forming vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-
to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. These two types of communications refer
to dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) standards that facilitate single
or multi-hop communication among VNs entities [12]. Here, we consider vehicles
as distributed edge users and utilize their local data to train FL models. Also,
they are equipped with simple communication and computation capabilities sup-
ported by onboard units (OBUs), consisting of various sensing devices. On the
other hand, RSUs are equipped with edge computing servers and designed as
the distributed edge servers stationed along the road, providing wireless commu-
nications from roadside infrastructure to vehicles. Further, RSUs are considered

as intelligent edge servers, providing and aggregating global models from dis-
tributed edge users in VNs.

Our proposed design architecture comprises three parts: the local data train-
ing executed by vehicles, model parameter validation and protection by em-
powering LDP-based blockchain, and global aggregation in the distributed edge
aggregator server. First, the system is started with the initial learning model
process, where initial model parameters of the global model W 0 are uploaded
to the blockchain-empowered distributed RSUs. Then, the edge users (i.e., vehi-
cles, donated by k) in iteration t retrieve global parameters W t from blockchain
and execute local training to generate the updated models wt
k using their lo-
cal dataset dk based on equation 1. Then, the LDP mechanism is conducted
by adding random noise (cid:15) to the updated models wt
k to strengthen the privacy
during uploading the trained local model and defend against linkability attacks,
such as membership inference attacks. In this case, k adds noise (cid:15)k to achive
(cid:15)-diﬀerential privacy based on equation 2 using Gaussian mechanism, which is
deﬁned by:

f (D) + N (0, S2

f σ2)

where N (0, S2
Sf σ [7].

f σ2) is the normal distribution with mean 0, and standard deviation

After that, k uploads wt

k with (cid:15) to the blockchain over distributed RSUs.
In short, through this phase, vehicles train their dataset locally and upload the
trained model updates collaboratively. Later, a particular consensus mechanism

legitimate for performing the global aggregation process to generate a new global
model in the VNs.

5 Numerical Results and Discussion

networks and LDP-based FL to produce the randomized privacy protection using
the IBM Library for diﬀerential privacy. The vehicular network prototype was
designed using a discrete event simulator with an optimized link-state routing
protocol to analyze network performance; the detailed prototype can be seen in
our previous work [8]. Figure 3 shows the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) against
MAC/PHY overhead during a simulation time of 100 seconds. As seen in the

10

ﬁgure, after 17s of simulation time, the overhead is practically consistent within
the range of 0.2 to 0.25, and it even gradually decreases. The lower the vehicle
overhead, the greater the performance of the system, and vice versa. Our pro-
posed protocol is relatively eﬃcient based on the preceding results because it
does not incur a signiﬁcant amount of overhead.

In order to form a decentralized FL system based on blockchain technol-
ogy, we use the consortium setting [3] that leverages blockchain to realize the
decentralized FL transaction, transparently evaluate the participants’ contribu-
tions to the global model, and develop a decentralized incentive system. In this
experiment, MNIST [13] datasets are used as a standard image classiﬁcation
with 10.000 images for the testing examples and 60.000 images for the training
examples. Each example is a 28 × 28 size gray-level image. Figure 4 shows the ini-
tial migration and deploying smart contracts using the Ethereum platform. The
ﬁgure shows that we need 164391 (0.00328782 ETH), 263330 (0.0052666 ETH),
and 1018839 (0.02037678 ETH) units of gas for initial migration, federated smart
contract, and deploying participants’ contribution implementation, respectively.
After deploying smart contracts, we can customize the number of participants
involved for local model training and calculate their contribution fairly based
on blockchain. Then, to implement the FL with DP model, we use a python-
based open-source library that IBM developed for the experimentation, simula-
tion, and deployment of diﬀerential privacy tools and applications [10]. Figure
5 shows DP-based FL experiment using diﬀerent privacy budget degrees, i.e.,
(cid:15) = 4.03, (cid:15) = 1.18 and (cid:15) = 0.522, in 15 epochs. According to simulation results,
Figure 5a with privacy budget (cid:15) = 4.03 achieves 95.80000024915344 model accu-
racy. In contrast, Figure 5b and 5c with privacy budget (cid:15) = 1.18 and (cid:15) = 0.522,
generates a model accuracy of 93.77999901771545 and 89.31000232696533, re-
spectively. Thus, the smaller value of (cid:15) (i.e., more noise added) generates higher
privacy (i.e., based on the gap between accuracy and validation) but lower ac-
curacy, and vice versa.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we presented the notion of secure edge intelligence for the VNs
by leveraging the merits of FL, blockchain, and LDP. We use the blockchain to
overcome a centralized server’s drawbacks. Moreover, blockchain can be used to
form a decentralized incentive system to encourage participants to share their
trained model. Furthermore, we use LDP to strengthen the conﬁdentiality of
data sharing transactions, especially in protecting the user’s private data from
various attacks. However, even though the FL approach is a promising method
to implement in a decentralized system, there are some signiﬁcant challenges,
especially in user selection issues for the model training process as well as sys-
tem and statistical heterogeneity. Further, we need to consider the eﬀect of the
privacy budget (cid:15) on the accuracy in future work, where the smaller value of (cid:15)
(i.e., more noise added) generates higher privacy but lower accuracy. Thus, it is
essential to consider these challenges for future research direction.
