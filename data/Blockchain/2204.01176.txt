Analyzing Voting Power in Decentralized Governance:
Who controls DAOs?

Abstract

We empirically study the state of three prominent DAO governance systems on the
Ethereum blockchain: Compound, Uniswap and ENS. In particular, we examine how
the voting power is distributed in these systems. Using a comprehensive dataset of all
governance token holders, delegates, proposals and votes, we analyze who holds the voting
rights and how they are used to inﬂuence governance decisions.

Keywords: DAO governance, liquid democracy

1 Introduction

Individuals with conﬂicting interests need to make joint decisions frequently in many parts of
society: in political elections, at party conventions, or at shareholder meetings. How can such
communities govern themselves and reach joint decisions in the most eﬀective and inclusive
way? Research on this question goes back centuries: In 1884, Charles Dodgson (better known
as Lewis Carroll, and author of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland) suggested a transitive voting
system in which candidates can transfer received votes to other candidates [4, 5]. Today, this
concept is commonly referred to as liquid democracy, and can be seen as a hybrid between
direct and representative democracy.
It has lately been applied in practice by Germany’s
Pirate Party who used it for internal voting [22, 11]. Recently, a lot of experimentation and
development in this area has been undertaken by communities around popular blockchain-based
projects. More and more such communities and stakeholder groups have formed so-called DAOs
(decentralized autonomous organizations) in order to govern their projects in a decentralized
manner. Many of them have set up governance systems to make decisions about the future of
their project. Such decisions could concern changes to a protocol or the use of the treasury
funds of a project. With DAOs becoming more and more inﬂuential, so do their governance
systems: Some DAOs already manage massive treasuries, the largest of them being Uniswap’s
$4 billion treasury.1 And their governance decision can be highly consequential: Uniswap’s
governance, for example, somewhat controversially decided to create a lobbying group called
the “DeFi Education Fund” and allocate $20 million of treasury funds to it in July 2021.2 The
novel designs of DAO governance systems and the large amount of power they hold make it
compelling and relevant to study how these systems work and how decisions are reached. Who
holds the voting power in these systems and how do the actors inﬂuence the decisions?

The usage of applications built on top of blockchains has risen dramatically in the past years.
Among the most popular are decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) applications such as decentralized
exchanges and lending protocols, as well as NFT projects. In this paper, we study three of the
most prominent governance systems on the Ethereum blockchain: The ﬁrst is Compound, a
decentralized lending protocol [14]. It was one of the ﬁrst protocols to introduce a governance
system and has been a role model for many other projects [13]. For instance, Uniswap, the
second governance we examine, has adapted Compound’s governance contracts. Uniswap is
a decentralized exchange and currently the largest decentralized ﬁnance project by market
capitalization and treasury value. Finally, we study ENS, the Ethereum Name Service, which
is a vital part of Ethereum infrastructure with a large community that recently formed a
governance.
Most DAO governance processes,
including the
three we study, involve multiple steps, only the
last of which takes place on the blockchain. For
example, the Uniswap governance process ﬁrst re-
quires a temperature check and a consensus check,
both of which are oﬀ-chain and require a cer-
tain threshold of yes-votes. Only when these two
thresholds are reached is a proposal put to a vote
on-chain. In this paper, we concentrate on the ﬁ-
nal on-chain votes where the actual decisions are
made.
In order to facilitate voting in a decentralized and
pseudonymous setting, DAOs issue governance
tokens and distribute them among stakeholders.
These tokens can initially be distributed in diﬀer-
ent ways: Uniswap for instance distributed their
UNI tokens among the team, early investors and
early users via an airdrop [12]. Later, the tokens
are freely tradable, making it possible to buy to-
kens and thereby voting power. In this sense, gov-
ernance tokens have similarities with shares in a
company that come with voting rights at share-
holder meetings.
The governance tokens can be used to vote on governance proposals: Each token counts as
one vote. For the voting, a simple form of liquid democracy [17] is used: To be able to vote,
a token holder must delegate their tokens to a delegate. Delegates can then vote on proposals
with the amount of tokens delegated to them. A visualization of the network of delegations
for Compound is shown in Figure 1. Note that both holders and delegates are addresses on
the blockchain.
In particular, multiple addresses can be controlled by the same person or
organization.
In this paper, we analyze how voting power is distributed and used in the governance systems.
In the process, we evaluate how decentralized these systems actually are (since this is a major
goal of blockchain-based applications). Furthermore, we examine the structure of the delegation
networks and study the voting behavior of diﬀerent types of delegates. Finally, we discuss why
it is not always possible to determine the exact distribution of power since multiple addresses
on the blockchain can be controlled by the same entity.

2 Related Work

A ﬁrst attempt at creating a DAO was made with “The DAO” in the early days of the Ethereum
blockchain in the year 2016 [7]. However, due to a hack, The DAO never actually operated
as intended. One of the ﬁrst governance systems around a blockchain-based application was
introduced by the stablecoin protocol MakerDAO in 2018 [15]. A case study of MakerDAOs
governance can be found in [21]. Since Compound set up its governance system in early 2020
[13], many other projects have followed suit. Some early analyses of the systems, mainly
focussing on the ownership distribution of governance tokens of decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi)
protocols, has been carried out in [20, 16, 10]. (For an overview of DeFi see [23, 2].) In a recent,
more detailed study, Barbereau et al. consider the governance systems of nine DeFi protocols:
Uniswap, Aave, MakerDAO, Compound, SushiSwap, Synthetix, Yearn Finance, 0x, and UMA
[3]. In their work, they focus mainly on token distribution and voter turnout. The analysis in
our paper goes deeper; we also examine voting behavior and delegation network structure.
Voting systems similar to those currently used by many DAOs have been studied for a long
time. They are often referred to as delegative democracy [6] or liquid democracy [4, 17].
The governance systems we study use slightly simpler versions of these concepts with a main
diﬀerence being that they only allow for voting rights to be delegated once from a token holder
to a delegate. In liquid democracy, it is often possible for a delegate to further (recursively)
delegate the tokens they received to another delegate. The use of liquid democracy in practice
has been studied in a case study of the German Pirate Party’s internal voting system [22, 11].

3 Overview of the Dataset

We collect data on the token holders, delegates and proposals for the Compound, Uniswap and
ENS governance systems from the Ethereum blockchain. Table 1 shows an overview of the
state of the governance systems on 1 March 2022. We consider the time period between blocks
9.000.000 (25 November 2019) and 14.300.000 (1 March 2022). The data was gathered using
the indexing protocol The Graph3 to query data from the Ethereum blockchain.

Table 1: Governance systems.

The delegation networks of the governance systems are visualized in Figures 1 and 2 using the
Python library NetworkX [9]. An edge between a holder (blue node) and a delegate (red node)
indicates a delegation. The sizes of the nodes are proportional to the amount of tokens held or
represented (with a minimum size for small holders and delegates).
We already see a clear diﬀerence between Compound and Uniswap on the one side and ENS
on the other side: For ENS, delegates tend to have a large number of holders of similar size
delegating to them. For Compound and Uniswap on the other hand, many delegates receive

most of their voting power from a single large token holder delegating to them. Note that
in such cases it is possible that the holder and delegate addresses are both controlled by the
same entity (and the delegate address was set up for voting purposes only). We investigate the
diﬀerence between the governance systems in more detail in Section 5.

4 Distribution of Voting Power

In the following, we study who holds the power in the governance systems. We examine this in
three steps: 1) How are the voting rights distributed? 2) How frequently are the voting rights
executed? 3) How much do the executed votes inﬂuence the ﬁnal governance decision?

4.1 Distribution of Voting Rights

As a ﬁrst step, we examine how voting rights are distributed in the three governance systems.
The distributions of delegated tokens among delegates are shown in Figure 3. From the visual-
ization, we already see that the voting rights are concentrated among a relatively small number
of delegates. To quantify this, we consider two inequality measures: the Gini coeﬃcient and
the Nakamoto coeﬃcient.
The Gini coeﬃcient [8] is the most commonly used index to measure inequality and ranges
from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality).
It measures area between the Lorenz
curve of a given distribution and the curve of perfect equality [8]. The Lorenz curves of the
distributions of tokens among delegates are shown in Figure 4. For all of this section, we
consider the distributions of tokens at block 14.300.000 which occurred on 1 March 2022. We
clearly see that ENS’ token distribution is less unequal that the other two. The precise values of
the Gini coeﬃcient can be found in Table 2. They show that the inequality in the distribution
of voting rights is very high in all three cases, the most extreme being Compound and Uniswap

with Ginis around 0.99. In particular, the inequality in the general distribution of wealth in
the world is a lot lower: The Gini coeﬃcient of the wealth distribution in 2020 is estimated to
be 0.850 in the US, 0.814 in Europe and 0.704 in China [18].

(b) Uniswap

(c) ENS

Figure 4: Lorenz curves of the token distributions among delegates.

We also see that the distribution of tokens among delegates is slightly more equal than the
distribution among token holders. Furthermore, considering only delegates who voted at least
once gives a slightly more equal distribution once again.
The Nakamoto coeﬃcient [19] is a measure of how decentralized a system is. Applied to our
setting, it counts the minimum number of delegates that together hold more than 50% of
the voting power. The Nakamoto coeﬃcients (see Table 2) reveal an extreme centralization
in all three governance systems: In the case of Compound, only 8 delegates can dictate any
governance action using their majority. For Uniswap this number is 11, for ENS it is 18.

and delegates who voted at least once. All numbers are rounded to 3 digits after the comma.

When we look at the Gini and Nakamoto coeﬃcients over time (see Figure 5), we see that the
extreme inequality in the voting power distributions has persisted for a long time and even

seems to be rising. On the other hand, the rising Nakamoto coeﬃcients also indicate that the
systems are becoming more decentralized over time.

4.2 Governance Participation

A second crucial aspect in analyzing voting power is considering how often delegates participate
in voting, i.e. how often delegates use their voting power.
The upper plots in Figure 6 show the fraction of the total supply of governance tokens which
is delegated (the total supply is 10 million for Compound and 1 billion for Uniswap). Since
delegating is a prerequisite of voting, this is the maximum amount of tokens that could have
participated in governance at that time. Furthermore, the ﬁgures show how many of these
tokens were actually used to vote for each proposal (each dot represents a proposal).
Note that only about two thirds of the total supply of COMP and UNI tokens are actually
circulating at the end of our observation period according to CoinMarketCap5. The remaining
amounts will come into circulation in the future. Since only circulating tokens are available
for delegating, a delegation rate of about 20% for Uniswap translates to 30% of all circulating
tokens. As a consequence, 15% of circulating governance tokens can currently take control of
Uniswap’s governance. Note that circulating supply has increased over time which could in
part explain the increase in delegated tokens.
The ﬁgures show that, on average, in both governance systems less than 10% of total tokens (or
15% of circulating tokens) participate in votes on proposals. Hence, already 7.5% of circulating
tokens would have suﬃced to win an average vote in the past.
To give a comparison, participation in voting at shareholder meetings of traditional companies
(which arguably share some similarities at least with Uniswap and Compound governance) is
a lot higher: According to [24], the participation rate among shareholders of US companies is
about 70%.
The lower plots in Figure 6 show the number of delegates in total and how many of them par-
ticipated in each vote. We ﬁnd that only a very small number of delegates actually participates
in voting (note the logarithmic y-axis). This again shows how the centralized these governance
systems are. For Compound the number has been falling and the average is currently around
20 while it has lately been below 100 for Uniswap.

Figure 7: Delegate governance participation.

Lastly, we take a look at how the participation rate of delegates depends on the number of
tokens delegated to them. Figure 7 plots how often delegates vote against the number of
delegated tokens. Each dot represents a delegate, and the dashed line shows the regression line.
We observe that delegates with more tokens delegated to them tend to vote more often. A
notable exception is the second largest Uniswap delegate, who has been delegated almost 12.8
million UNI tokens (from a single address) worth more than $13 million on 1 March 2022 but
has never voted in a governance decision.

4.3 Potential and Exercised Voting Power

As the ﬁnal step, we examine how the votes that are cast actually inﬂuence the outcome of
the governance decisions. It is one thing to have the potential to change a vote and another
to actually do it. We measure this using the following two metrics based on Kling et al. [11]
which are designed to quantify the potential and exercised voting power of delegates.

Deﬁnition 4.1 (Potential Voting Power). We measure the potential voting power of a dele-
gate by counting how often the delegate could have changed the outcome of a proposal vote
by changing their own vote. Formally, the potential power ppot ∈ {0, 1} of a delegate who
participated in a proposal vote is deﬁned as

ppot
d =

(cid:40)
1
0

if vd > 1
2
else

(cid:0)V (y) + V (n)(cid:1) − V (y) + δdvd > 0

where V (y) and V (n) are the number of Yes- and No-votes on the proposal, respectively. Fur-
thermore, vd denotes delegate d’s number of votes and δd ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether delegate d
voted Yes (1) or No (0) on the proposal.
The overall potential power of a delegate is then deﬁned as the mean of ppot

over all proposals.

d

Deﬁnition 4.2 (Exercised Voting Power). The exercised voting power measures how often the
vote of a delegate actually changed the outcome of a proposal vote, i.e. how often the result
would have been diﬀerent without the delegate’s votes. It is deﬁned as

pex
d =

(cid:40)
1

if

(cid:16) V (y)−δdvd

V (y)+V (n)−vd

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(cid:54)=

> 1
2

0

else.

V (y)

V (y)+V (n) > 1

2

(cid:17)

Again, the overall exercised power is then deﬁned as the mean over all pex
d .

Figure 8(a) shows the potential and exercised voting power of delegates in Compound gover-
nance system. We see that most of the potential voting power is shared among four of the
largest delegates. One of them could have changed the outcome of 5 of the 9 proposals they
voted one. This is again evidence of how much power lies in the hands of very few individuals.
However, we also see that these individuals do not exercise their power a lot: Their exercised
voting is far smaller than their potential power.
The same is true for Uniswap (see Figure 8(b)): Large delegates only exercise their voting
power very rarely. We look into this in more detail in Section 5.2 when we compare how large
and small delegates vote and ﬁnd that large delegates often vote in line with small delegates.
Note that most potential and exercised voting power of small delegates that can be seen in the
ﬁgures stems from two proposals with very close outcomes (which means that they could have
been inﬂuenced by many delegates): Proposal 16 for Compound6 and Proposal 7 for Uniswap7.

5 Delegate Classiﬁcation and Voting Behavior

In this section, we investigate the voting behavior of diﬀerent types of delegates. We have seen
in Section 3 that ENS seems to have a diﬀerent structure in its delegation network. In the
following, we will quantify these diﬀerences. To that end, we separate the delegates into two
groups: If a delegate receives at least 50% of their voting power from a single holder we classify
them as a single holder delegate. The remaining delegates are classiﬁed as community delegates.

5.1 Single Holder vs. Community Delegates

Figure 9 shows the share of delegated tokens that is controlled by community delegates. The
diﬀerence becomes clear right away: For ENS, about 60% of voting rights are in the hands
of community delegates while it is less than 10% for Compound and Uniswap. While the
fraction of voting rights held by community delegates has always been low for Compound, the
community delegates actually had more inﬂuence in the early stages of Uniswap governance.
This observation shows that delegations are currently not being used to a great extent in
Compound and Uniswap governance. Most voting power lies in the hands of delegates who
receive most of their voting power from a single token holder. It is possible that in many such
cases, the two addresses are controlled by the same entity.
In this regard, Compound and
Uniswap governance show similarities to shareholder meetings where large investors represent
their interests. ENS on the other hand, shows more similarities to a decentralized community.
Next we compare the voting behavior of community delegates and single holder delegates. We
ﬁnd that both groups vote similarly: They only voted diﬀerently on 3 Compound proposals
and a single Uniswap proposal.

5.2 Large vs. Small Delegates

We compare the voting behavior of large and small delegates. The biggest delegates that
together hold at least 90% of voting rights at the time of a proposal are classiﬁed as large
delegates. The remaining delegates are small delegates.
It is clear that large delegates, deﬁned in this way, hold all power in the governance system and
can decide any vote in their favor. But how often do they actually force against the minority
of small delegates.

9

Figure 9: Share of delegated tokens controlled by community delegates (i.e. delegates who
receive less than 50% of their votes from a single address).

We ﬁnd that this only rarely happens: In Compound governance, large delegates only voted
diﬀerently from small ones on 6 out of the 84 proposals. For Uniswap the picture is similar:
Here large and small delegates only disagreed on a single proposal, and that only very narrowly:
On proposal 7, large delegates were 50.5% in favor, while small delegates opposed it (34.5%
were in favor).

6 Address Clustering

In general, multiple addresses (holder as well as delegate addresses) can be controlled by the
same entity. This makes it diﬃcult to determine who actually holds the power and can make
the governance systems seem more decentralized than they actually are.
Moreover, the situations of a single entity controlling multiple addresses is actually favored by
the design of the delegation rules of the governance systems: It is only possible for a token
holder to delegate all of their tokens to a single address. If a token holder would like to delegate
to multiple delegates, they need to transfer their tokens to multiple addresses and delegate from
there.
An example of an entity requiring multiple addresses, could be a delegation program of a large
token holder, such as that of the venture capital ﬁrm a16z [1].
We try to detect such situations by considering transfers of governance tokens between ad-
dresses: If tokens are sent from one address to another, it is likely that the two addresses are
controlled by the same entity. Examining these transfers, creates a network of addresses with
links between them. In this network, we look for connected components. During the process,
we exclude special addresses such as exchange addresses. Using this method, we ﬁnd a number
of groups of addresses of Compound and Uniswap token holders which are potentially controlled
by a single entity.
Figure 10 shows two examples of such groups. Possibly these addresses are part of a16z’s
delegation program [1]. Of course, this method is not bullet-proof and we do not claim that the
addresses shown in the ﬁgure are for certain controlled by the same entity. With these examples,
we would like to demonstrate that blockchain-based governance systems are not always fully
transparent, and power in them can be more centralized than it seems.

7 Conclusion

Our analysis shows that the power in the governance systems of the DeFi protocols Compound
and Uniswap is extremely centralized and controlled by a very small number of addresses. Their
governance systems show similarities with shareholder meetings, where a small number of large
investors represent their interests. (ENS governance, on the other hand, more resembles of a
decentralized community.) However, we also see that large delegates do not often use their
power and mostly decide in the same way as the larger community, i.e. smaller delegates. We
state these observations without judgement. Nonetheless, they do illustrate the challenges of
building a truly decentralized governance systems.
As the importance of DAOs grows over time, it will become increasingly interesting to continue
researching along the lines of this paper. It will be possible to study a larger number of DAO
governance systems and more proposal votes in the future.
