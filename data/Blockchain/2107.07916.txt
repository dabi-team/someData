Abstract—Blockchain has become a key technology in a
plethora of application domains owing to its decentralized public
nature. The cyber-physical systems (CPS) is one of the prominent
application domains that leverage blockchain for myriad oper-
ations, where the Internet of Things (IoT) is utilized for data
collection. Although some of the CPS problems can be solved
by simply adopting blockchain for its secure and distributed
nature, others require complex considerations for overcoming
blockchain-imposed limitations while maintaining the core aspect
of CPS. Even though a number of studies focus on either the
utilization of blockchains for different CPS applications or the
blockchain-enabled security of CPS, there is no comprehensive
survey including both perspectives together. To ﬁll this gap, we
present a comprehensive overview of contemporary advancement
in using blockchain for enhancing different CPS operations as
well as improving CPS security. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst paper that presents an in-depth review of research
on blockchain-enabled CPS operation and security.

rity, Internet of Things

I. INTRODUCTION
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have become essential for
critical infrastructure worldwide, including water, energy, gas,
healthcare, transportation, and smart grid systems. These sys-
tems include Internet of Things (IoT) devices that generate a
massive volume of data, which they communicate to a central-
ized system. However, these devices have resource constraints
for data storage, processing, and security measures, which
pose signiﬁcant challenges for the security and efﬁciency of
CPS. As attackers are increasingly carrying out more directed
attacks, CPS have become important targets to achieve max-
imum impact. A recent example of the far-reaching impacts
of an attack on CPS is the recent Colonial Pipeline malware
attack [1]. This heightens the global importance of effective
CPS security solutions. As the number of these interconnected
devices continues to grow, with an estimated 29.3 billion
networked devices by 2023 [2], blockchain has emerged as
in restructuring CPS systems for
a signiﬁcant component
increased security and efﬁciency, as shown in Fig. 1.

Blockchain is regarded as one of the most important tech-
nologies that will bring about the next society transformation
into the future [3]. Decentralization, immutability, distributed
trust,
increased security, smart contracts, digital currency,
faster settlements, and minting are all properties of blockchain
that can be utilized to address different challenges of CPS. To

include in shared transactions with tamper-proof records, IoT
devices/CPSs will be able to transfer the data to blockchain
that is private in nature. Owing to the blockchain’s distributed
replication, diverse CPS data users can supply data from IoT
sources without the requirement for core management and
control systems. Each transaction may be veriﬁed by all the
stakeholders belonging to the ecosystem of the CPS, avoiding
disagreements and guaranteeing that each user is accountable
for his particular parts in the entire transaction. Although
solutions provided by blockchain are being adopted widely
in the contemporary CPS domains, because of the different
capabilities discussed, there are a lot of challenges in meeting
the diverse requirements of different CPS applications.

From the literature,

is observed that a lot of

the
blockchain-based security and operation surveys have been
conducted in the CPS domain. However, the review focus was
limited to speciﬁc considerations for either the operation or
the security of CPS achieved through leveraging blockchain.
In this work, we provide a detailed review of the research
works conducted in the blockchain-enabled CPS domain from
both the perspectives, and to the best of our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst paper with this level of exhaustive overview of
blockchain-enabled CPS.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We provide
sufﬁcient preliminary information in Section II. The related
works are discussed in Section III. We discuss the literature
related to Blockchain-enabled CPS in Section IV. We present

conclude the paper in Section VI.

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide some introductory information

regarding both CPSs and blockchain.

A. Cyber-Physical Systems

The concept of CPS is based on systems that incorporate
both cyber and physical systems to exchange data in real
time. A CPS is a network of embedded systems consisting of
sensors, aggregators, and actuators that are capable of mon-
itoring and controlling real IoT-related processes and objects
[4]. CPS consists of the integration of sensing, networking,
communication, control, and computation.

B. Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed method of
recording and tracking digital interactions [5]. Zhao [6] de-
scribes how blockchain utilizes a chain-like data structure,
which operates on a peer-to-peer network without a centralized
trusted authority, and uses cryptography such as cryptographic
hash and public-key cryptography. Each block contains various
transactions, and blocks are chained together and have great
redundancy. Therefore, if any blocks are altered or removed,
this can easily be identiﬁed, and this also makes it very dif-
ﬁcult to damage information on the blockchain. Furthermore,
blockchain uses the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which
is used to validate transactions and create new blocks on the
chain through solving a complex mathematical puzzle [6].

III. RELATED WORKS
A vast number of review articles on blockchain-enabled
CPS have been published, each covering a distinct component
of this research methodology. Many of these surveys focus on
CPS security, like Taylor et al. identiﬁed peer-reviewed litera-
ture regarding cyber security through blockchain by exploring
various adopted blockchain security applications in [7]. They
highlighted the potentials of different research studies in the
cybersecurity domain, even excluding the IoT, by blockchain
applications. Gupta et al. offered a survey in [8] that
is
primarily concerned with the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of
smart contracts in blockchain enabled CPS applications, where
software code can be easily hacked by the adversarial users.
They found that even complex designs of smart contracts fail
to mitigate the security issues and accordingly they investi-
gated Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) techniques for smart contract
privacy protection. Keshk et al. [9] provide a survey of current
privacy-preserving techniques that are used to protect CPS
systems and their data from cyber-attacks. They classify and
explain privacy protection techniques, including blockchain.

Others focus on control and operation of blockchain-based
CPS. Zhao et al. dissected various blockchain-enabled CPS
in terms of the operations and features utilized, and classiﬁed
them according to the sensitivity and throughput in [6]. Kan-
here addressed in [10] that, although a decentralized approach
realizes the true potential of CPS taking the unique features
into account, the application of blockchain for diverse CPS

domains has its own complex challenges. Braeken et al.
shed light into the technical and societal challenges, solutions
and opportunities in various application domains combining
the beneﬁts of blockchain and cyberphysical system [11].
In [12], Bodkhe et al. explored the state-of-the-art consensus
mechanisms, highlighting their strengths as well as weaknesses
in decentralized CPS applications, through a comprehensive
analysis. They further present the gaps in existing surveys
and propose a solution taxonomy of decentralized consensus
mechanisms for various CPS applications. A holistic sur-
vey of different CPS application domains including smart
grids, health-care systems, and industrial production processes
leveraging blockchain for robustness and reliability, has been
presented in [13]. They additionally provide a mathematical
model for determining if a certain application may beneﬁt from
the blockchain. Finally, Dedeoglu et al. addressed in [14] that
high latency, low scalability and throughput, and computation-
ally expensive consensus mechanisms greatly hinder the mass
adoption of blockchain in the CPS application domain.

Each of these studies sheds light on important considera-
tions for the usage of blockchain in CPS. However, none of
the existing studies provides a focus on the research trends in
using blockchain for enhancing CPS in different operations as
well as improving security of CPS.

IV. RESEARCH STUDIES

In the following section, we classify recent studies by their
focus. All the studies are certainly interrelated, and many could
apply to several of the categories. However, in classifying
the studies, we highlight the key objectives identiﬁed by the
authors in order to gain a better perspective on the principal
points of interest in recent research trends.

A. Cyber-physical System Security

Several studies place particular focus on CPS security. To
ensure data sources are authentic and reliable, in 2018, Fu et al.
proposed using blockchain in CPS for an information security
risk evaluation system in [15]. Later, in 2020, Wang et al.
analyzed the CPS data storage’s security risks and proposed
to utilize an improved blockchain mechanism for securing
the data in [16]. As the traditional Merkle hash tree fails
to batch add/delete, they proposed to use the combination of
accumulator and Merkle hash tree for non-membership proof.
Rathore et al. proposed a secure deep learning (DL) method
in [17] with blockchain for ensuring the cybersecurity of next-
generation IoT CPS where decentralized, secure DL operations
are performed at the edge nodes. This method contributed
for big data analysis of contemporary CPS by deploying DL
operation at edge layer and conﬁguring distributed DL in
a blockchain environment to ensure secure decentralization.
Lastly, Maloney et al. designed a security automation sys-
tem in [18] to deal with the operational security tasks and
managing the security of CPS without repetitive duty through
the integration of blockchain. The authors claim that
this
system, built on an Ethereum network, effectively increases
the security of the CPS devices ﬂeet and reduces complexity.

B. Cyber-physical System Control

Control is an essential factor in CPS, which can be tuned up
through blockchain. Tan et al. proposed a blockchain-based ac-
cess control scheme for Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS)
in [19], where a node’s account address in the blockchain is
utilized as the identiﬁcation number for accessing the CPSS
big data. For redeﬁning and storing the access control permis-
sion of CPSS big data, blockchain is utilized, which secures
the processes of authorization, access control, authorization
revocation, and audit. Garamvolgyi et al. [20] focused on
the control of CPS with the use of smart contracts. They
proposed an approach in which smart contracts are produced
from behavioral models, namely Uniﬁed Modeling Language
(UML) statecharts, to coordinate the use of CPS elements.
While the approach can be extended to other platforms,
they presented a proof of concept using Ethereum smart
contracts. Afanasev et al. [21] considered the advantages and
disadvantages of blockchain and smart contract for control,
workﬂow event logging, and monitoring in a Cyber-Physical
Production System network. They proposed a blockchain-
based architecture and provided relevant use cases.

C. Cyberphysical System Trust

Given the importance of blockchain for establishing trust
in CPS through decentralization and eliminating the middle
man, it is no surprise that this research direction has been
very active in the last few years.

In 2018, Machado and Frohlich [22] presented a split
blockchain-based architecture for increasing trust and decen-
tralization for IoT data in CPS by using three levels to develop
a chain of trust and using semi-trusted remote storage. Yang
et al. [23] presented a method of decentralized private data
acquisition blockchain using an on-demand data transmission
routing algorithm and M/M/1/k queuing model to meet the
trust and time consumption demands of CPPS. Afanasev et al.
[24] proposed the use of a blockchain network as a platform
for a distributed decentralized network through the use of
smart contracts for trustful communication between the nodes.
While the authors identiﬁed several improvements that can be
made, they presented the Ethereum blockchain as a positive
alternative to current CPPS network alternatives. Also, Gries et
al. [25] discussed the idea of using blockchain technology for
scalable and decentralized trustful information ﬂow tracking
for CPS, using Information Flow Monitor (IFM) to visualize
data without storing it.

Later, in 2019, Kandah et al. [26] presented a hardware-
software co-design approach that includes RF-DNA ﬁnger-
printing for devices to have unique identities, behavioral trust
management, a multi-layer decentralized database to manage
trust information, and construction of a dynamic trust through
RF-DNA ﬁngerprinting, and trust algorithms. Liu et al. [27]
presented a blockchain-based technique to allow secure routing
for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in mesh networks. The
proposed strategy establishes trust through encryption and then
uses blockchain to collect and redistribute routing information.
One critical issue which their strategy addresses is that it

enables source routing without revealing the mesh network’s
topology. In addition, LV et al. [28] proposed a blockchain-
based publish/subscribe model for privacy in communication
between sensing devices and interested nodes in the network.
The proposed model sought to solve the trust problem, the
issue of single-point failure, and uses public-key encryption
with equality test. The authors noted that the use of ElGamal
public-key cryptosystem with IND-CPA security ensures the
conﬁdentiality of the communications, while the use of the
Ethereum ensures anonymity for publishers and subscribers.
Then in 2020, Mohanta et al. proposed a signature storage
solution for a diverse set of blockchain-based CPS applications
for ensuring trust among the participating nodes in [29].
The solution, built with Docker tools and Ethereum network,
guarantees not only security properties but also reduces storage
space and cost. Beckmann et al. proposed to use blockchain as
the trust-enabling system component for Cyber-Physical Trust
Systems (CPTS), which is a CPS with IoT enriched with trust
as a system component in [30]. Milne et al. further elaborated
the CPTS driven by blockchain in [31] by providing formal
proofs of properties like integrity, identiﬁcation, authentica-
tion, and non-repudiation using the Tamarin Prover tool.

D. Cyberphysical System Performance and/or Storage

Studies have also been carried out with a focus on solving
the performance and storage issues caused by the exponen-
tially growing number of devices and data for CPS systems.
In 2018, Koumidis et al. [32] considered the integrity of
CPS record logs for accountability and proposed a blockchain-
based approach for computing block resource optimization in
the PoW mechanism, including computational cost.

In 2019, Li et al. [33] proposed a blockchain dividing
strategy using the community structure clustering method to
decrease communication load, storage of dispensable data,
and synchronization time. The proposed system also seeks
to improve the concurrency of the system, as well as the
efﬁciency of communication and data processing. Koumidis et
al. [34] developed a blockchain technique for securing event
logs in CPS, which bundles event data into blocks and delivers
them to the system components that monitor and control the
CPS in order to minimize the computational resources. Also,
in [35], and [36], Masood et al. presented a framework for a
blockchain-based distributed management system for closed-
loop CPS in order to address issues caused by computational
constraints, centralized control, and network dependency.

Then in 2020, Bouachir et al. [37] presented an analysis of a
fog-computing-based ecosystem integrated with blockchain for
IIoT in order to manage and enhance the data storage, quality
of service, and security requirements. In [38], for license-
free spectrum resource management in Cyber-Physical-Social
Systems (CPSSs), Fan et al. proposed a standard framework
using blockchain and smart contracts that can be used for
the edge computation of non-real-time data. For improving
the overall transaction speed, they proposed a blockchain-KM
protocol that effectively avoids losing typical attributes of a
general blockchain. Also, Isaja et al. reported on FAR-EDGE

experimentation of Smart Contracts and Blockchain, which
proposed a reference architecture based on edge computing
concentrating on efﬁcient distributed computing power and
network bandwidth usage, in [39].

Most recently, in 2021, Wang et al. [40] focused on the
storage and computing challenges caused by IoT devices used
with CPS cloud/edge computing. They proposed a Blockchain
Software-Deﬁned CPS (SD-CPS) framework that applies dis-
tributed resource management using cloud and edge computing
to reduce system delay.

E. Multiple Focus

A few studies from 2021 emphasize a combination of
objectives, including security, control, performance, data stor-
age, and privacy. Neelam and Shinray [41] presented an IoT-
enabled CPS model using a fully programmable recursive in-
ternetworking architecture (RINA) with secure authentication
using RINA password authentication for improving SDN and
blockchain-enabled security. Rathore and Park [42] addressed
the challenges of centralized control, privacy, and security in
deep learning (DL) for CPS. They proposed DeepBlockIoT-
Net, a DL approach for use in IoT CPS networks that uses
blockchain for DL operations applied at the edge layer for
decentralized and secure operations.

F. Cyberphysical System Applications

Finally, other studies focus on a variety of particular applica-
tions for blockchain in CPS, including shared manufacturing,
intelligent robots, and Smart
smart grid, energy systems,
Controlled Business Environments (SCBE).

In 2018, Zhao et al. [43] addressed the issues of security
and reliability of data distribution services. They proposed a
secure pub-sub (SPS) architecture for blockchain-based fair
payments with reputation, implemented with smart contracts
and Ethereum network, which effectively eliminated the need
for a reliable third party while maintaining conﬁdentiality,
the anonymity of the subscriber, and fairness. Wagner and
McMillin [44] considered security for VANETs, and presented
a blockchain architecture with physically veriﬁed transactions,
as well as a protocol for VANET security that does not require

assistance from roadside units (RSUs). Teslya and Smirnov
[45] proposed a cyber-physical framework for the creation
of intelligent robots that are considered separate entities,
interacting with each other. This framework can also unite in a
coalition to solve a common, complex problem with the help
of blockchain technology with smart contracts. Lastly, Dong et
al. [46] considered the opportunities and challenges presented
by blockchain in uses for developments in energy systems and
presented a prototype for future grids, which includes IoT,
cloud, and blockchain.

Then, in 2019, Patsonakis et al. [47] also focused on energy
systems, proposing a Demand Response (DR) energy system
design that uses blockchains and smart contracts for decen-
tralization to ensure security, privacy, reliability, audibility, and
resistance to tampering. Gu et al. [48] presented a blockchain-
based CPS security and safety protection framework for intel-
ligent manufacturing CPS. They proposed that blockchain’s
distributed architecture can be used to optimize CPS layout
and carry out data traceability while meeting the CPS safety
requirements and even improving CPS safety through imple-
menting the characteristics of data deposit and smart contract
into CPS. Ahmadi-Assalemi et al. [49] presented a framework
using federated Blockchain (BC) model with a digital Chain-
of-Custody (CoC) and a collaborative environment for the
CPSs to serve as Digital Witnesses (DW) for investigations
when an incident occurs. The framework facilitates object
behavior tracking in Smart Controlled Business Environments
(SCBE) and allows for proactive detection of insider threats.
In 2020, Kim et al. presented a comprehensive overview
of
the bat-
tery management system (BMS) from potential cyber-attacks
in [50].In [51], Barenji et al. addressed the security, scalability,
and big-data problems for small and medium manufacturing
enterprises (SMEs) by proposing a blockchain-based platform
as a trustable network. This platform is built on a consortium
blockchain which improves the consensus and communication
protocols based on blockchain-enabled CPS. Yu et al. also
addressed manufacturing and proposed a Blockchain-based
Shared Manufacturing (BSM) framework for CPS based appli-

through a Resource Operation Blockchain (ROB), carrying
out the basis of a consensus mechanism as well as a Smart
Contract Network. In [53], Moore et al. presented the design
and prototype of a blockchain implementation with CPS that
consisted of a cluster of microcomputers forming a smart
grid. These microcomputers, acting as nodes, are controlled
by the smart contracts of a private blockchain. Also, Shu et
al. presented a two-layer model for Medical CPSs (MCPS)
in [54], where medical records are stored off-blockchain and
shared on-blockchain. They also proposed a certiﬁcate-less
aggregate signature based on a multi-trapdoor hash function
for MCPS. They claimed that because of avoiding exponen-
tial operations and bilinear maps, the proposed method is
highly computationally efﬁcient. They further discussed the
defense strategies leveraging blockchain technology in BMS,
which can be used as the cybersecurity baseline reference.
Also related to healthcare, in 2021, Rachakonda et al. [55]
proposed Smart-Yoga Pillow, a Healthcare CPS edge device
that analyzes sleeping habits and physiological changes that
occur during sleep, with a focus on the security of data
transfer using RSA encryption, Ethereum blockchain, and
access policy smart contracts.

V. DISCUSSION

This section provides a statistical analysis of the papers
published from the year 2018 to 2021 in blockchain-enabled
CPS security and operation domains. Fig. 2 represents the
statistical ﬁndings of the related publications, speciﬁcally
Fig. 2(a) illustrates the pie chart of publications according to
the major contribution of the paper, and Fig. 2(b) represents
the papers according to the publication year. From the pie
chart, it is observed the largest group of the publications are
application-oriented, which holds 24% of the publications,
followed closely by CPS Trust systems. This research illus-
trates the wide variety of blockchain applications for CPS,
as well as the importance of blockchain in facilitating trust
in CPS. The CPS security papers are holding close to one-
tenth of the publications in these years. From the stacked
bar chart, it is seen that while there was a continuation of
CPS security concentrated papers till 2020, as the amount
of CPS blockchain research grew signiﬁcantly, the trend was
shifting from the CPS security concentrated papers to the
CPS operation focused papers. Also, there is a rising number
of papers in the blockchain-enabled domains other than CPS
security and operations. While the number of published papers
is currently much lower in 2021 than in recent years, it is
important to note that this survey only takes into account
papers published through the beginning of June 2021.

We also found some interesting trends from reviewing the
literature. Among the research studies that propose blockchain-
based models for CPS, 24 papers utilized smart contracts,
which are a set of agreed-upon rules or terms that run on
the blockchain to automate the execution of the terms without
the need for a third party [35]. Of these 24 works, 16
used Ethereum as the open-source ledger platform for smart

contracts. Also, 8 of the proposed models use edge networking,
and 11 of the models leveraged encryption-based methods
specifying the type. A detailed list of related reference papers
is presented in Table. I. Another insight is, for efﬁciency
purposes, PoW like consensus mechanisms are too complex
for CPS/IoT-based applications, leading to high delays and low
throughput [11]. A topic worth considering in future studies
on CPS-based usage of blockchain is the inclusion of greater
mining incentives [11].

VI. CONCLUSION
The intrinsic combination of distributed data storage, con-
sensus methods, and secure protocol
implementations in
blockchain efﬁciently solves diverse CPS performance and
security issues. In this paper, we review current research on
blockchain-enabled CPSs from both the security and opera-
tional viewpoints. In addition, we present some graphical rep-
resentations of research works that summarize existing studies
in an organized manner, which will aid future researchers in
focusing on less explored areas.
