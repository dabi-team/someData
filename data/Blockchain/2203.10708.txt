A Comprehensive Review on Blockchains for
Internet of Vehicles: Challenges and Directions

Brian Hildebrand, Mohamed Baza, Tara Salman, Fathi Amsaad, Abdul Razaqu and Abdullah Alourani

Abstract—Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) consist of smart vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as well as roadside units (RSUs) that
communicate wirelessly to provide enhanced transportation services such as improved trafﬁc efﬁciency and reduced trafﬁc congestion
and accidents. IoVs, however, suffer from issues of security, privacy and trust. Blockchain technology has been emerged as a
decentralized approach for enhanced security without depending on trusted third parties to run services. Blockchain offers the beneﬁts
of trustworthiness, immutability, and mitigates the problem of single point of failure and other attacks. In this work, we present the
state-of-the-art of Blockchain-enabled IoVs (BIoV) with a particular focus on their applications such as crowdsourcing-based
applications, energy trading, trafﬁc congestion reduction, collision and accident avoidance and infotainment and content cashing. We
also present in-depth applications federated learning (FL) applications for BIoVs. The key challenges resulted from the integration of
Blockchain with IoV is investigated in several domains such as edge computing, ML, and FL. Lastly, a number of open issues and
challenges as well as future opportunities in the area of AI-enabled BIoV, hardware-assisted security for BIoV and quantum computing
attacks on BIoV.

1 INTRODUCTION

O VER, the last two decades, Internet of Vehicles (IoV)

have been emerging as enabling cornerstone to the
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) [1]. Internet of
Vehicles (IoV) comprise of smart vehicles and roadside units
(RSUs) that communicate wirelessly to provide enhanced
transportation services and capabilities such as trafﬁc con-
gestion reduction, accident avoidance and infotainment [2].
This service are provided because vehicles contribute with
data to an trafﬁc management center and with each other to
build a spatio-temporal view of the trafﬁc state [3], [4].

Vehicles in IoV exchanges essential security messages
to allow many novel applications such as crash avoid-
ance, changing trafﬁc routes, dynamic route selection, crisis
cautioning, trafﬁc data, entertainment and content cashing,
etc [5]–[7]. RSUs are set adjacent to the streets. They can pro-
vide street safety, routing, and administration to the other
vehicles. However, traditional IoV follows the traditional
centralized model. In this model, vehicles as well RSUs
need to communicate directly with a central server to run
the services mentioned earlier. This model is susceptible
to single point of failure attacks. Also, raw data could be
intercepted and modiﬁed by adversary during transmission.
Moreover, the central server can be compromised by many
cyberattacks including DOS attacks [8], [9].

Blockchain is a decentralized technology that has re-
cently emerged to enable secure and trusted operations

in cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) and ﬁnancial applications.
Blockchain has several beneﬁcial properties such as im-
mutability, transparency, and high efﬁciency which could
be harnessed to enhance the security and preserve the pri-
vacy, integrity, and conﬁdentiality of IoV applications [10],
[11]. Due to its ﬂexible and decentralized data structure,
blockchain is not prone to a SPOF and is protected against
centralized attacks. Other features of blockchain include im-
mutability, transparency, and high efﬁciency. Immutability
allows the blockchain participating parties to establish mu-
tual trust between communicating nodes in a decentralized
blockchain network. Further, blockchain frameworks have
evolved beyond cryptocurrencies to support smart con-
tracts. Smart contracts are self-executing and self-enforcing
programs that run on the blockchain without being adminis-
tered by a trusted authority. Smart contracts provide a good
avenue for implementing needed self-executing actions like
managing blockchain updates for data exchange between
vehicles and across the network [12].

The greater efﬁciency afforded by blockchain will also
beneﬁt IoVs since real-world transportation scenarios re-
quire decisions or actions to be made in real time. Failure in
this could result in vehicular accidents or deaths. Therefore,
this survey aims to present the state of the art of IoVs that
employ blockchain for various applications. We also discuss
AI and machine learning applications for BIoVs. The Main
contributions of this survey are summarized as follows.

Related Surveys. There exist several surveys that focus
on Blockchain-based IoVs. Table 2 summarizes these sur-
veys and the main differences between them. The work by
[13] covers articles over a three year period beginning in
2017 and covers most of the Blockchain-based IoV applica-
tions such as energy trading, ride sharing, smart parking
and vehicle platooning. The survey by Dibaei et al. [14]
focuses primarily on securing communication technologies
in IoVs, including using ML and Blockchain defense mech-
anisms. Zuhair et al. [15] provides an overview of architec-
tures, characteristics and applications in IoV and provides
a taxonomy for IoV attacks and possible countermeasures.
The authors suggest that Blockchain can be used to enhance
the security and privacy of IoV. However, they do not go
too much into detail about Blockchain-based applications in
IoV, providing reviews of a few articles on smart parking
and vehicle platooning. Karger et al. [16] provides a system-
atic literature review of Blockchain’s role in mobility and
transportation in smart cities. The survey by Khoshavi et al.
[17] focuses primarily on operation and security improve-
ment aspects that Blockchain could provide for connected
and autonomous vehicle (CAV) transportation systems. The
authors discuss in detail Blockchain IoVs applications for
energy trading, ride sharing, smart parking, vehicle platoon-
ing and collision avoidance. They also cover some aspects
of AVs and ML. There also exist surveys on blockchain
applications in smart cities [19], the energy sector [20] and
privacy management in social IoVs [21]. Lastly, Baldini et al.
[22] provides a survey of the use of distributed ledgers in
transportation.

In summary, many of the preexisting surveys cover some
of the Blockchain-based applications in IoV. Our survey
provides detailed review to recent achievements on using
Blockchain to secure IoV as well as focusing on incor-
porating ML and FL for Blockchain-based IoV. A related
survey to us [14] that discusses ML and FL applications for
Blockchain-based IoVs but does not go depth as our work
and also our work provides recent published works till 2022
. To ﬁll in the gaps in the research, our survey presents
more details on Blockchain-based applications in IoV and
discusses detailed Blockchain implementations of artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) or federated learning (FL) applications in
IoV.

Organization of Paper. The rest of this paper is or-
ganized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of

Blockchain implementations for IoV, including an overview
of relevant Blockchain consensus algorithms. Section 3
presents an overview of Blockchain-based applications in
IoV such as energy trading, ride sharing, vehicular cloud
computing, and vehicular edge computing. Section 4 pro-
vides an overview of federated learning (FL) followed by
Blockchain enhanced implementations of FL. Section 5 out-
lines challenges and future directions for Blockchain-based
IoVs and this is followed by a conclusion in section 7.

In this section we provide an overview of IoV including the
IoV architecture and IoV applications and the advantages of
IoV. We also provide an overview of Blockchain technolo-
gies, including consensus algorithms relevant to IoVs.

2.1 IoV Architecture and Overview

Fig. 1. Typical IoV Infrastructure

IoV is a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) that has been
connected to the Internet [23]. VANETs are a type of mobile
ad hoc network (MANET) comprised of smart vehicles and
roadside units (RSUs) that communicate wirelessly, sharing
information such as vehicle speeds and positions [24]. IoVs
can also be supplemented with AI and ML technologies to
create an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Figure 1
illustrates a typical IoV infrastructure where vehicles com-
municate with other vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communication and communicate with RSUs using vehicle-
to-RSU (V2R) communication. IoV is a vehicle-speciﬁc im-
plementation of IoT that focuses primarily on connecting
vehicles to the network infrastructure, other devices and the
Internet. IoT refers to the networking of everyday objects
such as home appliances equipped with sensors and com-
puting capabilities with the goal of embedding technology
into the background of everyday life.

By sharing important trafﬁc information such as road
conditions and trafﬁc congestion between vehicles on the
network, IoVs are capable of improving trafﬁc efﬁciency
and reducing trafﬁc congestion and accidents [25]–[28]. In
addition to safety-related applications, IoVs may also be
designed to support other applications such as autonomous
driving, infotainment, payment services, and vehicle usage
tracking for calculating insurance rates [24], [29].

The primary advantages of IoV include improved trafﬁc
and ﬂeet management, improved road safety, and better
allocation of resources such as energy and fuel consumption.
Implementing an IoV infrastructure would also increase the

effectiveness and efﬁciency of autonomous driving appli-
cations. These advantages would also provide tangential
beneﬁts such as the reduced cost of goods and services
that depend on our transportation system. For example,
greater efﬁciency and better energy or fuel savings have
the potential to lower the costs of food and products sold
in stores since the price of such products takes into account
delivery costs.

2.2 Overview of Blockchain Technology

A typical Blockchain system can be expressed as a collab-
oration of devices or nodes. However, the nodes do not
necessarily trust one another. Together, the nodes maintain
a set of shared global states and perform transactions that
may modify the states. Blockchain is a special type of data
structure that is capable of storing historical states and
transactions. All nodes in the system agree on the trans-
actions and their order. Blockchain has been evolved to sup-
port smart-contracts which are considered an autonomous
computer programs that can run on a Blockchain network
and its terms can be pre-programmed with abilities such

as self-enforcement without the interference from trusted
authorities.

2.2.1 Security Services of Blockchain

Figure 2 depicts a Blockchain data structure. Each block
in this structure is linked to its predecessor by way of a
cryptographic pointer. The ﬁrst block in the structure is
called the genesis block. Due to this design, Blockchain is
characterized as being a distributed ledger. Each block in
Blockchain contains a roothash or Merkle root that contains
the hashes of all transactions [30]. The transaction lifecycle
is depicted in Fig. 2 To add a block to Blockchain, a miner
must successfully solve the computationally difﬁcult puzzle
of ﬁnding the right nonce for a block header. Blockchain
offers several key features such as:

• Decentralized data management. Every peer in the system
has the authority to add data to the ledger, which
is referred to as making a transaction. In this way,
no one peer owns the Blockchain system more than
another. IoVs would beneﬁt from decentralization since
it would remove obvious problems related to reliance

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDAPLE AND SECURE COMPUTING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, NOVEMBER 2018

4

on a central authority such as the potential for a single
point of failure.

• Data security, tamper-proofness, anti-forgeability and data
integrity. Blockchain is designed to store data in an im-
mutable and tamper-proof fashion. The decentralized
nature of Blockchain makes it is inordinately challeng-
ing for attackers to modify the ledger. Immutability
would beneﬁt IoVs in many ways such as providing
immutable proof of vehicle transactions related to en-
ergy trading, ride sharing, smart parking and payment
for leading a platoon.

• Transparency. A shared public list of transactions or
exchanges of data provides every peer in the network
access to every transaction ever made on the system.
Therefore, the system is transparent. IoVs would partic-
ularly beneﬁt from the transparency of exchanges in the
context providing all parties and insurance companies
transparent access to shared vehicular accident data.

• No central point of

failure. The lack of a centralized
storage system eliminates the possibility of losing data
stored on the system by an attack of one node. This
feature is particularly important in the context of IoV
since failure of the system could result in accidents, loss
of human life and economic losses.

• High efﬁciency. Checking balances and completing trans-
actions in a Blockchain system can, in theory, be instan-
taneous. High efﬁciency is particularly important in the
context of IoV due to the dynamic and fast changing
nature of vehicles on the road.

2.2.2 Consensus Algorithms

The content of Blockchain’s distributed ledger consists of
historical and current states. Any updates made to the
ledger must be agreed upon by all parties. This agreement
is referred to consensus. Several consensus algorithms exist
for Blockchain. These algorithms can be characterized as
computation-based or communication-based. Computation-
based algorithms use proof of computation to randomly
select a node and that node decides the next operation. In
communication-based algorithms, each node has an equal
vote and it takes multiple communication rounds to reach
consensus. Bitcoin utilizes the Proof-of-Work (PoW) con-
sensus algorithm, which is a purely computation-based.
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is an example
of a purely communication-based consensus algorithm [31].
Other consensus algorithms such as Proof of Elapsed Time
(PoET), Proof of Authority (PoA) fall somewhere between
computation-based and communication-based. Table 2 pro-
vides an overview of the primary consensus algorithms
relevant to IoVs.

In PoW [32], the miner that expends the most amount of
work or effort solving the hash puzzle is chosen to propose
the new block. Therefore, in Blockchain systems that utilize
PoW, miners that have greater computation power have a
greater chance of being selected to propose a new block.
Proof of Stake (PoS) was ﬁrst introduced by Sunny King
and Scott Nadel [33] in 2012 as a more scalable and energy
efﬁcient alternative to Bitcoin’s PoW. In PoS, the ability to
validate blocks is based on how many coins or network
tokens the user has. PoS helps protect the Blockchain system
from malicious users who wish to take over the majority

of validation by requiring the malicious user to acquire a
large amount of tokens in order to launch an attack on
the system. Proof of Authority (PoA) [34] is a modiﬁed
version of PoS that uses the validator’s identity in lieu of
a user’s stake. In PoA, transactions and blocks are validated
by approved accounts known as validators. Under PoA,
individuals must earn the right to become a validator based
on their reputation. Individuals are motivated to support
the transaction process to retain their reputation and sta-
tus as a validator. Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) [35] was
designed to be more efﬁcient and use less resources and
energy than conventional PoW. PoET also makes use of
a fair lottery system to ensure efﬁcient consensus process.
The lottery system provides every participant a chance of
being selected by spreading this chance equally amongst
participants. Dan Larimer [36] ﬁrst proposed Delegated
Proof of Stake (DPoS) in 2014 as a faster and more energy ef-
ﬁcient replacement for Bitcoin’s PoW consensus algorithm.
DPoS protects Blockchain better than PoW by employing
an election process that ensures transactions receive better
representation within the system. Users vote for delegates or
witnesses who are responsible for generating and validating
blocks. The primary difference between PoS and DPoS is
that in PoS, users vote on the validity of blocks, while in
DPoS, users elect delegates to validate the blocks.

Another notable Blockchain consensus algorithm is
RAFT [37], which stands for "Reliable, Replicated, Redun-
dant And Fault-Tolerant." RAFT is based on the Paxos [38],
[39] and was developed with the primary goal of increasing
understandability and providing a better foundation for
building practical systems. To make Blockchain consensus
more understandable, RAFT separates the key elements
of consensus such as leader selection, log replication and
safety. RAFT also enforces a stronger degree of coherency
in order to reduce the number of states that must be con-
sidered. In addition, RAFT affords enhanced safety using
a mechanism for changing cluster membership to overlap
majorities.

Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus Algorithms.
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) refers to the ability of a
system to resist failures resulting from the Byzantine Gen-
erals’ Problem [40]. The Byzantine Generals’ problem is a
logical dilemma ﬁrst conceived of in 1982 where a number
of generals must come to a consensus with the decision to
retreat or attack. Communications between generals can be
delayed, lost or destroyed or a general may act maliciously
by sending fraudulent messages to bemuse other generals.
With respect to Blockchain, generals refer to the different
nodes or participants on Blockchain which may send false
information or their communications may be delayed, lost
or destroyed. A number of BFT-based algorithms have been
proposed for Blockchain consensus such as Practical BFT
(PBFT) [31], Redundant BFT (RBFT) [41], Delegated BFT
(dBFT) [42] and BFT Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS)
[43].

Castro and Liskov [31] designed Practical Byzantine
Fault Tolerance (PBFT) for asynchronous systems to pre-
serve liveness and safety while providing increased per-
formance. Liveness means that clients receive replies to
their requests while safety means that the replicated service
satisﬁes linearizability [44], [45]. Concurrent operations are

considered linearizable if they perform in a way that is
equivalent to sequential operation. PBFT operates under the
assumption that the maximum number of malicious nodes
is no greater than or equal to one-third of all nodes on
the system. Thus, as the number of nodes on the system
increases, the system becomes more secure. Aublin et al.
[41] designed Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RBFT).
RBFT achieves better performance during occasions where
faults occur achieve this, RBFT executes multiple instances
of BFT in parallel. RBFT is similar to PBFT but has an added
procedure for transaction veriﬁcation called "PROPAGATE".
Another consensus is called Byzantine Fault Tolerant
Delegated Proof of Stake (BFT-DPoS) which is a combination
of BFT and DPoS [43]. Like DPoS, BFT-DPoS participants
that hold tokens vote on block producers. The algorithm
supplements traditional DPoS with BFT by allowing all
producers to sign all blocks as long as no producer signs
two blocks using the same timestamp or same block height.
In addition to cryptocurrency, BFT-DPoS has been employed
by authors such as [46], [47] for Blockchain-based vehicular
networks, which are discussed in Section 3.5 below.

Finally, Table 2 provides a summary of the most promi-
nent consensus algorithms employed in Blockchain. Over-
all, PoW provides good scalability but worse performance
while BFT-based procotols such as PBFT offer good perfor-
mance and limited scalability [48]. PoS requires less energy
than PoW and therefore is more beﬁtting for large-scale
Blockchain applications like IoT and IoV [49]. Permission-
less Blockchains that use PoW, PoS and DPoS offer high
scalability but have low throughput and high conﬁrmation
times. On the other hand, permissioned Blockchains that
use PBFT and RAFT offer little scalability but have high
throughput and low conﬁrmation time. The basic distinction
between permissionless and permissioned Blockchains is
that permissionless Blockchain allows anyone to participate
in the Blockchain while permissioned Blockchain requires
prior approval to participate.

3 BLOCKCHAIN-BASED IOV APPLICATIONS

In this section, we review the primary applications of
Blockchain-based IoVs. Figure 4 summarizes the current
achievements in BIoV applications.

3.1 Energy Trading

With the advancement and increase in the number of electric
vehicles (EVs), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks have been
developed that are capable of providing a two-way ﬂow of
electrical energy between EVs and charging stations within
smart grids [50]. Energy trading is the mechanism used
by V2Gs that permits charging and discharging of EVs
and other entities and serves to manage energy demand
[81]. In an V2G network, EVs can act as either energy
consumers by charging their batteries at charging stations
or energy producers by discharging surplus electricity back
into the system. In this way, energy trading in V2G networks
can serve to enhance overall energy efﬁciency and greater
sustainability [51], [82].

Traditional V2Gs, however, rely on a central server,
which is susceptible to SPOF. Therefore, a number of

researchers have proposed implementing V2Gs using
Blockchain [50]–[52]. In addition to solving the centraliza-
tion problem, Blockchain can be utilized to enhance security
and privacy of EVs as well as offering the Blockchain ben-
eﬁts of decentralization, security, immutability and trans-
parency. However, there are several Challenges to integrate
Blockchain in V2G networks for energy trading (See Table
3) that include securing the identity and location privacy of
EVs during energy trading while at the same time ensuring
the efﬁcient distribution of energy amongst V2G entities.
Another challenge to integrate Blockchain in V2G networks
used for energy trading is ensuring the scalability of the
V2G network to support the dynamic nature of EVs over the
network, including the increasing number of transactions on
the network.

To solve the problem of identity privacy, the authors in
[50] proposed a Blockchain-based efﬁcient authentication
scheme for V2G networks designed to preserve the iden-
tity of EVs. Merkle Root Hash (MRH) is used to verify
and validate transactions before adding new blocks to the
Blockchains. The scheme also provides for a reward mecha-
nism for EVs for participating in the regulatory and manag-
ing process. A major drawback with this scheme is that it is
not fully decentralized as it requires utility company to act
as the third party to maintain the Blockchain and validate
transactions. In another works [83], [96], the authors have
proposed using pseudonyms to preserve privacy, however
because EVs are anonymous, a dishonest EV may abuse
such anonymity by pretending as multiple non-exiting EVs
to submit multiple reservations/offers without committing
to them. To address this problem and a common preﬁx link-
able anonymous authentication scheme have been used so
that if an EV submits multiple reservations/offers at the spe-
ciﬁc timeslot, the Blockchain nodes can identify and reject

such submissions. In another works [84]–[86], Blockchain
has been used to enable Dynamic wireless charging of EVS
to enable the exchange of power between a mobile EV and
the electricity grid via a set of charging pads (CPs) deployed
along the road. To ensure EVs anonymity and data unlink-
ability, group signature technique is used to enable EVs to
send charging requests anonymously. However, there is no
implementation to measure the scalabilty and performance
issues of using Blockchain technology in the case of dynamic
wireless charging of EVS.

To address location privacy, techniques employed in the
research include obfuscation [87], [97], differential privacy
[88]–[90], [98], [99], K-anonymity [51], [91], [92], [100], [101]
and pseudonym exchanges [93]–[95] and combination of all
these techniques [102]. For example, K-anonymity is a mea-
sure of anonymity of entities within a dataset where meth-
ods such as suppression or generalization of data within
that dataset are used to ensure the individuals or entities
within that dataset cannot be reidentiﬁed [103]. Such rei-
dentiﬁcation can be either directly or indirectly by inference
by comparing the individual’s data to data within another
dataset [103]. It is referred to as K-anonymity because there
must be at least k other entities that share the same set
of identiﬁable attributes for the entity to be considered k-
anonymous. Methods for increasing K-anonymity include
removing, hiding or encrypting identiﬁable attributes for
the entity within the dataset. The authors in [51] suggest that
K-anonymity best serves vehicle identity privacy in the con-
text of Blockchain-based V2G networks. In this work, the au-
thors propose a P2P EV energy trading scheme that makes
use of consortium Blockchain and K-anonymity based on an
undirected graph to protect the location privacy of EVs. EVs
within the network can be visualized as nodes or vertices
and the connections between the EVs as edges. In this work,
not all EVs share connections with all other EVs. When an
EV makes an energy trading request, it collects the locations
and identities of all other EVs on the network and sends the
locations and identities of all these EVs in the request along
with its own. By including all EVs within each request, an
adversary would have a difﬁcult time identifying which EV
made the actual request.

Scalability of the V2G network is another challenge to
integrating Blockchain in V2G network for energy trading.
To address the scalability challenge, the authors in [52]
proposed using a lightweight Blockchain-based protocol
called directed acyclic graph that uses an IOTA ledger

with a tangle data structure to record transactions securely
and in a scalable manner. The authors uses IOTA ledger
as is more suitable for recording and processing a large
number of micro-transactions. Also, IOTA networks are less
susceptible to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
since no single node retains the unique privilege to create
or maintain the data structure. The work developed a tip
selection algorithm that allows the addition of new trans-
actions without the need of miners, thereby decreasing the
amount of computation power needed. Here, a tip refers to
a transaction that has yet to be approved. Game theory is
used to allow EVs negotiate with the grid for the best price
and match EVs with the most optimal grid.

In energy trading one of the concerns is to select an EV
with the best bid price. Authors in [53], has used smart
contract to select the most appropriate bid price dynamically
among all the charging station where Blockchain is used
to maintain information about the EV route, car battery

status and the preference of driver. After getting updated
information from Blockchain, charging stations broadcast
their desired price to the EV network from where EV selects
the best one though the underlying payment system is still
one of the limitations of their proposed scheme. In [54], a
hidden commitment is sent to the Blockchain by the EV for
reserving a place in the charging station with the best price
though management of this system is not good as the charg-
ing station does not aware about the reservation until the EV
reaches the deﬁnite charging station. Also, authors do not
mention about the payment system along with the privacy
protection of the EVs as well as this proposed scheme is
prone to Sybil attacks and denial of service (DoS) attack.
Optimization for the electricity consumed and its price is
also a concern issue in energy trading which is mentioned
in [56] where authors have proposed a decentralized elec-
tricity trading system based on consortium Blockchain by
using iterative double auction optimization method or V2V

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDAPLE AND SECURE COMPUTING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, NOVEMBER 2018

charging. In energy trading it is also needed to maximize the
operator's proﬁt while to give the EV best service price. To
make the operator's beneﬁt maximum, authors in [55], has
proposed a contract theory with integration of Byzantine
fault tolerance consensus algorithm to reach the consensus
in the permissioned energy Blockchain. Another scenario to
maximize user's beneﬁt along with the minimizing the cost
has been proposed in [57], where authors have utilized a
double- objective optimization model for constructing this
optimal charging scheduling algorithm that considers both
V2V and CS2V.

Wu et al. [79] discuss how to keep a P2P energy trading
secure and reliable as new roles and players such as EVs
are injected into energy systems. They also discuss how
to improve the cooperation between regulated energy sys-
tem players such as utility companies and non-traditional
players such as EVs. The authors suggest that blockchain
and multi-scale ﬂexibility services can serve as an key en-
ablers for solving issues of security, reliability and trust and
better coordination between traditional and non-traditional
energy-trading roles. Smart contracts can be employed as
self-regulating and self-executing mechanisms for matching
energy producers with consumers for energy trading. Smart
contracts can also be implemented to automate ﬂexibility
including the clariﬁcation of energy trading
processing,
roles (providers and suppliers) and responsibilities. One
drawback to their proposal is that it is not completely decen-
tralized as they suggest professional players and decision
makers should play the role of regulating the energy system.
As mentioned, EVs can sell energy in exchange for
rewards or payment. However, a malicious server may
attempt to develop behavior proﬁle for an EV, which poses
a privacy issue. To solve this issue, one could apply a
private data sharing scheme similar to the one proposed
by [80]. Although this proposal focuses on securing private
data on IoT devices in general, a similar scheme could be
applied to EV private data concerning energy trading. The
authors proposed a blockchain-based privacy preserving
and rewarding private data sharing scheme for IoT. The
authors make use of deniable ring signature and Monero to
implement behavior proﬁle building prevention with non-
frameability. The proposal also uses licensing technology
executed by smart contracts to ensure ﬂexible access control
for multi-sharing.

3.2 Crowdsourcing-based applications

Crowdsourcing is a novel model in which customers as
well as organizations obtain goods or services. Examples
of Crowdsourcing includes ride sharing and smart parking
systems. During ride sharing one of the major concerns
is to protect the privacy for both riders and drivers and
riders as for accessing this service they need to share their
personal information such as location. To solve this problem,
the work in [58] has proposed a Blockchain-based zero-
knowledge proof protocol by which a rider can his service
from a veriﬁed driver that will be done by the peer nodes
in the Blockchain. Tough this problem does not address the
problem associated with the attacker disguised as the rider
and also due to presence of a central authority for issuing
the keys, this model is not fully decentralized.

Computational overhead is a common drawback in BIoV
during ridesharing. To solve this issue, in [59], authors have
proposed consortium Blockchain which uses attribute-based
proxy re-encryption algorithm for guaranteeing the security
and privacy of the shared data. The DPoS (Delegated Proof
of Stake) is used here for storing the block and verifying it
for traceability if needed. On the other hand, fog computing
is used in [61], to match drivers with the passengers locally
which can lessen the computational overhead. Authors here
used a private proximity test with location information
for generating a unique secret key which is used between
passenger and driver. A private Blockchain has also been
introduced for keeping the record of ridesharing. Here, hash
value is stored in Blockchain whereas encrypted data is
stored in cloud.

To address security and privacy issues in ride sharing,
In [60], Baza et. al have proposed a privacy-preserving
ride sharing scheme using the permissionsless Blockchain.
The main idea of the proposed scheme is to that riders
hide their exact pick-up and drop-off location information
by cloaking their location information. The authors also
addressed the problem of malicious behaviour of drivers
and riders using the open and permissionsless Blockchain.
The main idea is that dishonest drivers and riders are
published by paying an initial deposit before the beginning
of the trip. Then, using zero-knowledge proof, drivers have
to prove to the Blockchain their good willing by submitting
the pick-up location. The Blockchain can verify that the
driver lies in a set of predeﬁned pick-up locations without
knowing the exact pick-up location to preserve privacy. The
proposed techniques use the IoV infrastructure so RSUs
verify the driver’s pick up location before submitting it
to the Blockchain. In another work by [9], and instead of
the cloaking technique, the authors proposed to represent
the ride sharing area into overlapping grids so nearby rid-
ers/drivers can share rides. Then, for privacy-preservation,
drivers/riders should encrypt their requests/offers using a
lightweight cryptosystem, and then the Blockchain matches
the encrypted offers and requests to ﬁnd the best nearby
driver/rider.

Another sourcing models including smart parking sys-
tem to enable individuals to share available parking slots to
drivers. Because the number of vehicles in the IoV is increas-
ing exponentially which leads to a fast-growing problem of
ﬁnding vacant parking slots. Latest parking system have
several privacy and security vulnerabilities such as they are
centralized which cause single point of failure. They also
do not consider the privacy issue of the drivers [104]–[107].
It is also needed to share the location information for this
smart parking, and it is a big concern to provide location
privacy during trafﬁc data sharing or ridesharing [108]–
[111]. Blockchain is key to solve these problems regarding
security and privacy. Authors in [62], [112], proposed a
Blockchain based smart parking system which can preserve
the driverâ ˘A ´Zs location by using the private information
retrieval (PIR) technique. A short randomize signature is
used to allow the drivers to put parking reservation re-
quest anonymously without exposing their real identities.
Payment system here utilizes time locked criteria anony-
mously by exploiting smart contract and Blockchain be-
tween drivers and parking station.

3.3 Vehicle Platooning

The ever-increasing number of vehicles on the road has
led to increased pollution [113] and trafﬁc congestion [114],
[115]. One potential solution to these problems is to utilize
vehicle platooning. In a vehicle platoon system, a leader ve-
hicle transmits its velocity and acceleration to other vehicles
that follow it in the platoon. Based on the information trans-
mitted from the platoon leader, the follower vehicles will,
in turn, adjust their velocity and maintain a safe distance
between themselves [116]–[119]. Figure 5 illustrates a typical
vehicle platoon system. In essence, the vehicles act similar to
a train where the leader can be likened to a locomotive and
the followers to the cars it pulls. Advantages of vehicle pla-
tooning include improved trafﬁc capacity, trafﬁc congestion
reduction, reduced energy consumption and improved driv-
ing experience for platoon followers [65], [120], [121]. For the
platoon to successfully function, reliable and low-latency
V2V communications between the vehicles are required.
However, V2V communications can suffer from security and
privacy issues. The security and privacy features offered
by Blockchain could be used to solve such issues. Issues
regarding implementing Blockchain in a vehicle platooning
system include encouraging vehicles to serve as platoon
leader, ensuring platoon leaders are paid for leading, and
the handling the dynamic nature of vehicles entering and
leaving platoons during their journey.

Proposals for integrating Blockchain into vehicle pla-
tooning systems exist as early as 2018. Wagner and McMillin
[63] were the ﬁrst to discuss Blockchain’s potential role in
vehicle platooning. The article’s main focus is on securing
IoVss using Blockchain but they discuss vehicle platooning
as a use case and they provide a novel proposal for validat-
ing integrity of vehicles participating in the platoon. Ying et
al. [64] proposed a Blockchain-based platoon management
system for autonomous vehicles. To increase the overall
safety of the system, their proposal limits communication
outside of the platoon to the platoon leader. The proposal
also makes use of smart contracts for paying the platoon
leader. The authors in [65] proposed a vehicle platooning
system that employs both smart contract and Blockchain for
secure payment of platoon followers to the platoon leader.
The authors’ proposed system is designed to handle the
dynamic nature of vehicles entering and leaving platoons
throughout their journey. Their proposal utilizes path in-
formation to match the vehicles and elects platoon leaders
based on their recorded reputation. The authors in [66]
proposed a truck platooning system with a location-aware
and privacy-preserving veriﬁcation protocol based on zero-
knowledge proof and permissioned Blockchain. Their pro-
posed system provides lower latency and communication
overhead by performing the veriﬁcation process within a
spatially-local area deﬁned by the platoon.

3.4 Trafﬁc Congestion Reduction

IoV implementations of IoVs can serve to reduce trafﬁc
congestion on roads and highways. Information regarding
trafﬁc congestion can be shared between vehicles [122],
[123]. Vehicles who have yet to approach the congested area
can use this information to alter their routes and avoid the
congestion. This, in turn, will help reduce the congested

eration to follower vehicles so that they can match the leader vehicle and
maintain a safe distance between themselves

area. However, the trading of road congestion information
raises security and privacy concerns especially in terms of
revealing the location information of vehicles. Features of
Blockchain could be utilized to solve these security and
privacy concerns [124], [125].

Li et al. [68] proposed a trust management protocol
called CreditCoin which makes use of an incentive mech-
anism to encourage vehicles to share trafﬁc information.
Under authors’ proposal, RSUs and ofﬁcial public vehicles
make use of authors’ proposed BFT-based consensus mech-
anism, which repeats a voting process until an agreement
is reached. Advantages of authors’ proposal include low
computation time and the ability to defend against Sybil
attacks. Drawbacks to authors’ proposal include limited
scalability and privacy leakage concerns. Although BFT-
based consensus provides overall good performance, it only
provides limited scalability [48]. Privacy leakage concerns
exist in authors’ proposal because the system combines
credits with transactions and transactions are accessible by
everyone. Liu et al. [26] proposed a Blockchain-based trust
management model with a conditional privacy-preserving
announcement scheme for IoVs. The system uses an anony-
mous aggregate announcement protocol to allow vehicles to
send messages such as trafﬁc information anonymously and
thereby guarantee the privacy of the vehicles in an untrusted
IoVs. Similarly, Yang et al. [25] proposed a decentralized
trust management system for IoVs using Blockchain where
vehicles can validate messages containing information such
as trafﬁc information from other vehicles using a Bayesian
Inference Model. Vehicles rate each vehicle using this model
and upload their ratings to RSUs, which are responsible for
calculating the trust value for each vehicle and packaging
such values into a block in Blockchain. Their system makes
use of a combination of PoS and PoW consensus algorithms.
One drawbacks to this work includes the potential for
privacy leakage related to the fact that authors’ proposal
uses vehicle identity number and a malicious entity could
use this information to discover the identity of the vehicle.
The authors suggest a future work could make use of public
key encryption to solve this problem.

Though our current trafﬁc can be turned into decentral-
ized by adding Blockchain, then this system will face a new
challenge associated with data integrity and data privacy
during the incorporation of connected vehicle data into
real trafﬁc system because of the transparency advantage
in Blockchain. In [126], authors propose a location aware
trafﬁc management with addition of non-interactive zero
knowledge range proof protocol (ZKRP) and permissioned

V2VIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDAPLE AND SECURE COMPUTING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, NOVEMBER 2018

modular Blockchain which is based on Hyperledger fab-
ric platform and Hyperledger Ursa cryptographic library.
This data management which has also a gateway that
authenticates each incoming vehicle. Instead of providing
the incoming vehicleâ ˘A ´Zs identity, it will send a ZKRP
encrypted message to the gateway for validation where
the gateway acts as the veriﬁer and the incoming vehicle
acts as the prover. This model can stand against spooﬁng
attack, eavesdropping attack and tampering but it requires
high running time required as Hyperledger Ursa does not
compute in parallel and this model doesn’t provide any
scenario if the gateway encounters more than one request
at a time in multiple region scenario.

Kumar et al. [78], employ Blockchain along with deep
learning to address security and privacy vulnerabilities
in a cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS).
The proposed framework addresses security issues using
Blockchain and deep learning modules. The Blockchain
module is used to securely transmit data between AVs,
RSUs and trafﬁc command centers. The module uses a
smart contract-based enhanced PoW (ePoW), a consensus
algorithm ﬁrst proposed by Keshk et al. [127], which is more
energy-efﬁcient alternative to PoW and PoS and is designed
to authenticate data records and prevent data poisoning.
ePoW estimates its proof based on the number of records in
the dataset. Lastly, the proposal by Kumar et al.’s [78] has a
deep learning module that uses a Long-Short Term Memory-
AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) to encode C-ITS data to prevent
inference attacks. The authors propose an Attention-based
RNN (A-RNN) to analyze the encoded data and detect
intrusive events on the C-ITS.

3.5 Collision and Accident Avoidance

AVs use non-linear controllers in order to maneuver through
the dynamic and ever-changing nature of vehicles on the
road [128]. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication can
be harnessed to share information gleaned from on-board
sensors with other vehicles and alert them of objects or
persons on the road and other hazardous road and en-
vironment conditions so that vehicles can take appropri-
ate actions to avoid collisions with objects or persons
or accidents [129]. The increased connectivity and relia-
bility provided by IoV can further improve this feature.
V2X refers to communications between vehicle and things
within its environment such as trafﬁc lights, pedestrians and
other vehicles. As such, V2X is also an all-encompassing
term that includes other communications such as vehicle-
to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-RSU (V2R), vehicle-to-
onboard-sensors (V2S) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) com-
munications. The increased connectivity and reliability pro-
vided by IoV can provide faster and more efﬁcient delivery
of V2I communications regarding the road environment to
vehicles which, in turn, can serve to enhance vehicle local-
ization. Localization refers to the method by which an IoV
determines the accurate location of a vehicle. However, with
such increased localization also arise concerns of security
and privacy of vehicle location. One should also consider
the security and privacy of other entities participating over
IoV. The security and privacy features of Blockchain could
be harnessed to solve such issues.

Robin Westerlund [69]

proposed an Ethereum
Blockchain-based system where AVs use smart contracts
to reserve and exchange road spaces for travel. According
to author, this system could be used to ensure AVs do not
try to occupy the same spaces and maintain a safe distance
from one another so as to prevent accidents and collisions.
Through a simulation, the author demonstrated that the
proposed system provides a high level of security and
reliability.

Another approach is to apply the concept of swarm
robotics to the cooperation of AVs within the context of
IoVss and IoV. Under swarm robotics, robots communicate
and share information with the goal of coordinating actions
for a common goal. Based on this concept, Singh et al. [70]
proposed a Blockchain-based framework using PoA as an
efﬁcient consensus mechanism for swarm robotics. A similar
swarm technique could be explored in the context of AVs
within a IoVs or IoV. Swarm coordination of AVs secured
by Blockchain could be used to coordinate the movement of
vehicles on the road to prevent collisions and, in particular,
the coordination between AVs crossing through an intersec-
tion.

IoV can also be harnessed to reduce collisions resulting
from improper lane changing decisions and those caused
by failure to identify vehicles, particularly smaller vehi-
cles such as motorcycles, approaching a vehicle from its
blind spot. The authors in [47] proposed a Blockchain-
based collective learning (BCL) framework for the secure
and efﬁcient lane changing of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs). BCL adopts federated learning (FL). Using
FL in lieu of a central server solves the problem of reliance
on a central server and single-point-of-failure (SPOF) attacks
and allows vehicles to take advantage of the collective
intelligence of all vehicles on the network. Using consortium
Blockchain to store the collective learning regarding lane-
changing behavior further secures the learning process and
helps prevent false information sharing.

Buzachis et al. [71] proposed an autonomous intersection
management system that uses Hyperledger Fabric permis-
sioned Blockchain and smart contracts to securely manage
AVs as they cross through intersections. AVs use V2I com-
munication to relay information such as vehicle identity,
speed and position to an intersection management agent.
To ensure only valid AVs make crossing requests with the
intersection management agent, AVs are required to send
their requests using digitally signed messages using public
key encryption. The intersection management agent deploys
a smart contract with the AV how to safely cross the intersec-
tion and records each crossing in Blockchain. In the case of
multiple requests from different AVs to cross an intersection,
the system uses a ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-serve (FCFS) algorithm to
determine the order of intersection crossings. One drawback
for authors’ proposal is that it is not completely decentral-
ized as intersection management agents are assumed to be
under the auspices of public trafﬁc authorities.

In a later work, Buzachis et al. [130] propose a similar
intersection management system based on the agreement
between AVs through V2V communication rather than re-
lying on an intersection management agent. Similar to [71],
the system makes use of Hyperledger Fabric permissioned
Blockchain and the ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-serve algorithm. How-

ever, in this proposal, AVs host the Blockchain ledgers and
conduct smart contracts. Based on simulations, however, the
authors concluded that the relay of information between
AVs was too slow to provide reliable real-time intersection
passing decisions. Future research can be done to decrease
communication latency and make the system more scalable
with a larger amount of AVs requesting passage.

3.6 Infotainment and Content Cashing

Implementing a IoVs using IoV improves better Internet
connectivity for vehicles and this increased connectivity can
serve to improve the delivery of in-vehicle infotainment to
vehicles such as music and video content for passengers.
Such content will enhance the experience and enjoyment of
drivers and passengers. However, this connectivity raises
concerns regarding the security and privacy of the content
delivered to vehicles. The increased security and privacy
provided by Blockchain could be used to solve these con-
cerns. Kim and Ryu [67] proposed a system called autoCoin
designed to encourage smart vehicles to exchange info-
tainment securely. Their system makes use of a scalable
Blockchain architecture and smart contracts to exchange
infotainment contents in a peer-to-peer fashion rather than
rely on a third-party to deliver infotainment content. In
addition, autoCoin makes use of a variant of PoS called
Proof-of-Stake Deposit (PoSD) as a consensus mechanism
and includes a reward mechanism to encourage vehicles to
share content.

Some propositions for IoV utilize a cognitive engine to
perceive content requirements of users and match them
with content providers and thereby improve the content
caching hit rate. Figure 6 illustrates a traditional cognitive
IoV (CIoV) infrastructure. A CIoV infrastructure consists
of three layers: (1) vehicular layer, (2) edge layer, and (3)
remote-cloud-based content providers and cognitive engine
layer. In the vehicular layer, vehicles collect data using
onboard sensors and send them to the cloud for data
analysis by the cognitive engine. Vehicles in this layer also
communicate with each other using V2V communication.
In the edge layer, vehicles communicate with RSUs using
vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) communication. In the remote-cloud-
based content provides and content cognitive engine layer, a
cognitive engine percieves the needs of vehicles using deep
learning and ML.

3.6.1 CIoV Challenges and Solutions

There are several issues with CIoV [131]–[133]. Table 4 sum-
marizes the various challenges to implementing an effective
CIoV infrastructure. First, the process used by a CIoV intro-
duces privacy and security issues. Contents requesters may
submit data such as points of interest or other private data
that could be leaked. Also requesters may receive data from
untrusted parties. Other problems with traditional CIoV
include limited transaction time for obtaining contents, the
cognitive engine cannot accurately determine true content
requirements, the content stored on nearby RSUs may not
meet the needs of a requester, and the constant broadcast of
content

In response to these problems, the authors in [73] pro-
posed a Blockchain-based privacy-aware content caching

proposed scheme. The work aims to improve the cache
hit ratio by designing the cognitive engine to perceive the
content requirements of requesters using ML or deep learn-
ing and sending such perceived content requirements to
RSUs ahead of time. Vehicles receive content by download-
ing it when RSUs and vehicles broadcast it. Since content
requester vehicles just receive the broadcast, rather than
sending an individual request that contains the requested
content, the requested content is private. A cognitive engine
is responsible for detecting when content requesters connect
to providers by V2R or V2V communication and record the
transaction. Providers in authors’ scheme need to collabo-
rate together to provide content because transient vehicle
requesters may not always be in range of any one provider.
When a provider provides content, it receives a reward and
after the transaction is complete, the cognitive engine will
record it in Blockchain.

3.7 Summary Remarks

In this section, several BIoV applications have been dis-
cussed in details. Blockchain is a promising solution to
solving many of the problems security of V2V communi-
cations in energy trading, crowdsourcing, trafﬁc congestion
and collision avoidance, vehicle platooning and infotain-
ment applications. Trust management systems that utilize
Blockchain are a promising solution to solving issues related
to the security and privacy of vehicles when sharing trafﬁc-
congestion information. The reputation of vehicles sending
accurate trafﬁc information can be stored in Blockchain and
used to limit the possibility of vehicles sending false trafﬁc
information and such systems can be supplemented with
incentive mechanisms to encourage the sharing of trafﬁc
information. Future work needs to be done to solve the
issues of privacy leakage and selecting the most efﬁcient
consensus mechanism that is both capable of handling the
dynamic nature of the road and ensuring scalability of the
IoVs.

Using Blockchain and smart contracts can be utilized
to aid vehicles to securely coordinate their positions and
share information about road hazards. ML and AI tech-
nologies can be harnessed to supplement the system, giving
vehicles access to collective learning of all vehicles to help
them make more intelligent decisions with regard to lane
changing decisions. One of the main issues is scalability
and performance issues of using Blockchain technology
in the case of dynamic wireless charging of EVS. As we
discussed, dynamic wireless of EVs enables the exchange
of power between a mobile EV and the electricity grid
via a set of charging pads (CPs) deployed along the road.
Using Blockchain can be used to provide secure dynamic
wireless charging of EVs, however because of scalability and
performance issues of current Blockchains, there is more
research is required to provide scalable and fast charging
using Blockchain.

4 FEDERATED LEARNING FOR BIOV

Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning
(DML) approach that has garnered recent increased interest
due to ability to learn from data without sharing the data.
However, some challenges for FL include defending against
poisoning and member inference attacks and centralization
and loyalty issues. In response to these challenges, there
have been a number of proposals to enhance traditional FL
with Blockchain.

In this section, we ﬁrst distributed learning followed
by an an overview of FL. Then, we discuss challenges
with existing FL approaches, how blockchains can resolve
these challenges, and existing blockchain-based FL for IoV
applications. Finally, we summarize of the applications of
Blockchain in FL for vehicular networks and some of the
existing challenges in these approaches.

4.1 Overview of Distributed Learning & Federated
Learning

In traditional ML, a single computer or central server trains
using locally stored data [134]–[140]. This approach lacks
scalability, consumes more time and is not feasible for

Fig. 7. Blockchain-based Privacy-Aware Content Caching Architecture.
There are four phases: (1) cognitive engine data analysis in which the
cognitive engine sends recommended content sets to vehicles. The
cognitive engine uses data analysis and AI techniques to update the
content caching and improve the content caching hit ratio. (2) Vehicle
registration phase in which each vehicle chooses a role as either content
requester or content provider. A provider can also change its role to
requester when it wants to request content (3) content broadcasting
and acquisition in which a provider broadcasts content and the required
download time for the content. and (4) content transaction in which
each completed content sharing transaction is recorded by the RSU and
stored in the Blockchain.

AI and ML technologies can also be employed to en-
hance and optimize the delivery of infotainment to ve-
hicles for Blockchain-enabled IoVs. For example cognitive
engines can be employed to intelligently perceive content
requirements of users, match them with content providers
and cache them at RSUs. Qian et al. [73] proposed a
Blockchain-based privacy-aware content caching architec-
ture that records content sharing transactions in Blockchain.
They also designed a cognitive engine for their proposal that
utilizes ML to perceive content requirements and store them
in RSUs ahead of time. Similarly, Dai et al. [72] proposed
a Blockchain-empowered distributed caching framework
where content is cached in participating vehicles. Base sta-
tions serve to pair caching requesters to caching providers
and use AI to predict V2V transmission ranges and connec-
tion duration between content requesters and providers.

big and distributed data applications that require real-time
decisions [135], [141]. Scalability is the ability to manage
increases in computation load or in the number of users
[137]. If the ML training data gets too large, it may exceed
the memory and computational resources of the central
server [141]. A good training model requires a great deal
of training data. Failure to obtain a sufﬁcient amount of
training data could result in an inaccurate global model.

In response to these limitations, DML was developed,
where learning models can be trained on subsets of data
distributed across several nodes [136], [141]. The primary
motivation behind DML arises from the need to share re-
sources, such as the computing abilities of multiple comput-
ers [137] and the distributed nature on current networking
applications. The advantages for training across multiple
nodes include greater scalability and efﬁciency. Parallel
execution of learning tasks across multiple nodes leads to
reduced training time. DML provides a higher degree of
availability, which is the measure of the proportion of time
a system is available for use [137]. The distributed nature
of the nodes solves problems associated with running out
of computing, storage and memory resources on a central
server.

Despite the many advantages DML provides, it still
suffers from issues in heterogeneity, security, and failure
handling and it needs improvements to its scalability [137].
DML suffers from heterogeneity: A DML may ﬁnd it dif-
ﬁcult to train across multiple diverse nodes each with
differing memory, storage and computation abilities and
resources [137]. Security and privacy issues arise when
vehicles transmit raw data collected from their sensors [142].
For example, raw data may contain private information
such as the location or destination of a vehicle. DML also
suffers from failure handling, requiring measures to manage
situations when one node fails [137].

In response to above concerns, researchers at Google Inc.
[143] proposed and developed FL as a new approach to
DML. FL involves training distributed local models on local
devices or vehicles (referred to as clients or participants) in a
federated fashion [143]. FL consists of three primary phases:
initialization, aggregation, and update. Based on general
descriptions in the literature, we created an illustration
of traditional FL framework shown in Figure 8. During
initialization, FL participants download a global model from
a central aggregator. Each participant uses this global model
as the basis for training their own new local model using
locally collected data. When ﬁnished training their local
model, the participants upload a local model update to the
central aggregator which is responsible for aggregating the
local models of all participants to form a new global model.
Only the local model update are transmitted. The training
data itself remains with the participant. After aggregation,
the participants download and begin training on the new
model. This process repeats for multiple iterations until the
global model reaches a preset accuracy or optimal conver-
gence.

The primary difference between FL and DML is that
DML focuses on harnessing parallel computation while
FL concerns training models locally on each client [144].
DML assumes that datasets are distributed in identical sizes
across all nodes. In FL, however, the size of the datasets for

Fig. 8. Traditional Federated Learning Framework

each node can be heterogeneous or of differing sizes [145].
FL offers greater privacy than the traditional ML on a central
server. Participants train locally using their own collected
data. FL provides greater privacy by only requiring par-
ticipants share local model updates with the central server
rather than raw data [142]. Due to the advanced privacy
offered by the FL approach, many researchers have adopted
FL for applications such as healthcare data [146], [147],
medicine [148], smart city sensing [149], smartphone next-
word prediction [150], and improving Google keyboard
suggestions [151].

4.2 Challenges for Traditional Federated Learning

Despite the privacy enhancements FL offers, FL suffers from
challenges such as centralization, loyalty, vulnerability to
single-point-of-failure (SPOF), poisoning and membership
inference attacks, and communication efﬁciency [152]–[162].
Table 5 provides a summary of these challenges and dis-
cussed in details as follows.

• Centralization Issues. This problem exists because FL
relies on a central server to aggregate local model, i.e.,
the aggregator [152]. If the aggregator malfunctions or
is compromised e.g., by a SPOF attack, the entire FL
system could fail. A single-point-of-failure attack is
an attack designed to take down any network element,
such as a central server in FL, that would cause the
entire network to fail.

• Lack of loyalty mechanism. Traditional FL also lacks
a loyalty mechanism for encouraging participants to
share their local learning models. Some works, such as
[153], have suggested using a contract theory approach
to design an incentive mechanism to encourage par-
ticipants to participate in FL. Also, the authors of [154]
utilize a trading market process to stimulate the sharing
of learning models.

• Poisoning Attack. This attack occurs when a partici-
pant submits false or low-quality model updates that

resources such as bandwidth, energy, and
power can slow down communication

"poison" the FL model, which can result in a less accu-
rate global model or cause the global model to outright
fail [155].

• Membership inference attack. This attack occurs when
an adversary utilizes reverse engineering techniques to
gain access to a participant’s local model updates from
the central server and uses this information to steal the
local dataset of the participant [155], [156].

• Communication efﬁciency. Communication remains a
critical bottleneck in FL networks [158]. The vast num-
ber of devices or vehicles on an FL network combined
with their limited resources such as bandwidth, energy,
and power can slow down communication across the
FL network. For example, vehicles with greater com-
putation resources would still have to wait on those
with less resources. To address this challenge, many
researchers have focused on reducing the number of
communication rounds [143], [163] or decreasing the
transmission payload size [162], [164]–[166]. According
to [161], these approaches assume a noise-free commu-
nication scenario and focus primarily on ML design
that trades off computation and communication. More
recent works focus on communication system design
in lieu of ML design [159]–[161]. For example, Wei and
Shen [161] investigated how to improve communication
performance when communication occurs over noisy
channels or those that contain communication errors.

4.3 Federated Learning in IoV Enhanced by Blockchain

Blockchain’s distributed and decentralized features have the
potential to solve the challenges of traditional FL. For exam-
ple, replacing traditional FL’s central server with Blockchain
solves the centralization problem and protects against SPOF
attacks. Veriﬁcation Procedures can be implemented into
Blockchain aggregation to help protect against data poison-
ing attacks. To solve problems with loyalty, procedures can
be implemented into Blockchain such as providing rewards
for vehicles or miners for supplying good model updates.

Figure 9 illustrates a general

implementation of
Blockchain in FL for vehicular networks. A task publisher
supplies a FL task, an initial global model, and a test-
ing dataset to the blockchain system. Participant vehicles

download the global model from the blockchain system and
use it as a basis for training a local model using its own
local dataset. After training its local model, a participant
vehicle adds its local model update to the blockchain. Some
frameworks such as [152] also utilize miners to collect local
model updates and add them to Blockchain. Then either
using a central aggregator that is a blockchain node or
within the blockchain process, a node retrieves the local
model update and aggregates all local models to form a new
global model. After aggregation, the vehicle participants
download the new global model and the process repeats for
multiple iterations until the global model reaches a preset
accuracy or optimal convergence.

4.3.1 Blockchain-Based FL for Autonomous Vehicles

In [152], authors propose a Blockchain-based FL system
for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The framework is com-
posed of miners and AVs. Miners could be nodes on the
network edges such as cellular base stations or AVs with
high computing capabilities for the mining process. The
authors use Blockchain in lieu of a central server to solve the
centralization problem and develop a loyalty mechanism to
reward AVs for providing good learning model updates.
The reward amount is based on the usefulness of the data
sample sizes. The framework also rewards miners who win
the mining race. The mining reward is based in the miner’s
mining power, which is calculated by the number of useful
data samples they collect from AVs.

Under the authors framework, AV’s obtain latest global
model from Blockchain. Based on this model, AVs per-
form local learning and send a local model updates to a
nearby miner. Since each AV maintains their best ML model,
they are capable of making intelligent decisions even when
they lose connectivity. All miners verify the local model
updates, execute proof-of-work (PoW) and then generate
a block to record the validated local model updates. The
aggregation of the local models is added to this block as
a new transaction. To address the additional delays associ-
ated with Blockchain management, the authors conducted
an accumulated end-to-end delay analysis that took into
consideration PoW, communication delays and computation
delays. Authors used this analysis to minimize the overall
delay of the system by dynamically adjusting block arrival
rate.

4.3.2 Blockchain-Based FL for Vehicular Networks En-
hanced by Model Update Veriﬁcation & Local Differential
Policy

In [156], the authors proposed a secure FL framework that
takes advantage of the capabilities of Blockchain smart
contracts to protect a 5G Network FL framework from
poisoning attacks. The authors supplement their framework
with local differential privacy (LDP) technologies that add
Gaussian noise to a participants local model updates to
protect a participant from membership inference attacks
[167] [168]. The authors in [155] borrowed this approach
to implement a privacy-preserving Blockchain-based FL for
trafﬁc ﬂow prediction.

To develop their privacy-preserving Blockchain-based
FL for trafﬁc ﬂow prediction, the authors in [155] utilized
consortium Blockchain in lieu of a central server in FL to

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDAPLE AND SECURE COMPUTING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, NOVEMBER 2018

Fig. 9. Typical Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Framework for Vehicular Networks

protect against SPOF attacks. They also utilized a modiﬁed
version of dBFT as a consensus algorithm. The dBFT con-
sensus algorithm is similar to PBFT except that it allows
for the ﬂexible changing of miners rather than requiring
a ﬁxed miner group. The authors supplemented dBFT
with mechanisms to protect against security attacks. For
example, they added model update veriﬁcation to ensure
only qualiﬁed model updates from participant vehicles are
aggregated by the aggregator. In model update veriﬁcation,
each miner RSU uses a testing dataset provided by the task
publisher to judge whether a local model update is qualiﬁed
for aggregation. Only qualiﬁed local updates with than a
given threshold (set by the task publisher) are presented for
aggregation. This process helps the system defend against
poisoning attacks that would taint the global model during
aggregation. Inspired by [156], the authors in [155] also use
LDP to protect the vehicle participants from membership in-
ference attacks. When a participant vehicle uploads a model
update, Gaussian noise is added to disturb the location
information of the participant.

4.3.3 Blockchain-Based Galaxy Federated Learning for Ve-
hicular Networks

In [169], the authors propose a Blockchain-based FL frame-
work called Galaxy Federated Learning (GFL). GFL’s stor-
age system is composed of
(1) Ethereum
Blockchain and (2)
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
Ethereum is a decentralized open source Blockchain ﬁrst
conceived by Vitalik Buterin [170] with built-in smart con-
tract capabilities [171]. IPFS is a decentralized P2P ﬁle stor-
age system based on Blockchain [172].

two parts:

GFL utilizes an innovative algorithm designed by the
authors called Ring decentralized FL algorithm (RDFL)
[169]. RDFL uses Ring-allreduce algorithm in distributed
ML, consistent hash algorithm, and knowledge distillation.

When training across multiple nodes, each node would
normally have to wait for all other nodes to ﬁnish their
training during each training iteration. The Ring-allreduce
algorithm solves this communication efﬁciency problem by
arranging all nodes in a circle or ring where each node
receives data from its left neighbor and transmits data to its
right neighbor [173]. During the scatter-reduce step, nodes
exchange data so that every node on the ring receives a
chunk of the ﬁnal result. During the allgather step, the
nodes exchange those chunks so that all nodes receive
the ﬁnal result. GFL’s RDFL uses a customized version
of this algorithm, which is described in more detail be-
low. Knowledge distillation involves compressing a large
model into a smaller, distilled model [174]. Distilling the
dataset greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to
be transmitted, improving overall communication efﬁciency
and reducing communication pressure. GFL also uses an
encryption mechanism to improve transmission efﬁciency
and ensure the security of the transmitted information. GFL
uses both asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption
to encrypt every piece of information in Blockchain.

RDFL makes full use of a networks bandwidth and
improves GFL’s security and robustness under malicious
node attacks. Under RDFL, after each node completes local
training, each untrusted node, according to the consistent
hash algorithm, sends its model parameters to the ﬁrst
trusted node in a clockwise fashion. By using the consis-
tent hash algorithm, RDFL transfers model parameters of
untrusted nodes to different trusted nodes, which reduces
communication pressure. Also, each trusted node uses Ring-
allreduce algorithm (modiﬁed for RDFL) to pass model
parameters to the next trusted node in a clockwise fashion.
This process repeats until eventually all nodes have the
model parameters of all nodes and all nodes reaches a stable
state. Ring-allreduce helps maximize bandwidth utilization

for model parameters between nodes. After all nodes reach
a stable state, RDFL uses knowledge distillation to transfer
knowledge (contained in the model parameters) to its locally
trained model parameters.

Using IPFS also helps GFL reduce communication pres-
sure since IPFS transmits a 46-byte IPFS hash of the model
parameters in lieu of sending the actual model parame-
ters. RDFL uses model parameter synchronization, which
reduces communication congestion. RDFL also provides
better bandwidth, which helps solve the communication
efﬁciency problem. To solve the model security problem,
RDFL reduces the inﬂuence of malicious nodes by not
allowing untrusted nodes to access model parameters from
other nodes. In addition, RDFL encrypts IPFS hash of model
parameters to avoid exposure on Blockchain and protect
information security. Lastly, GFL solves the aggregation
performance problem by using knowledge distillation and
dynamic polarization ratio to improve generalization of
model while ensuring safety of the model. According to the
authors, knowledge distillation has greater accuracy than
FedAvg as an aggregation method for non-IID data.

4.3.4 Hybrid Blockchain Framework with Asynchronous FL
for Vehicular Networks

In [175], authors propose a hybrid Blockchain framework
with asynchronous FL that addresses challenges such as the
computing efﬁciency, shared data reliability, delays associ-
ated with FL, and heterogeneity. Due to the heterogeneous
communication and computing capabilities of vehicles par-
ticipating in FL, there may be different learning rates for
each and this slows down the learning iteration to the
speed of the slowest participant vehicle. By making the
system asynchronous, authorsâ ˘A ´Z framework resolves this
heterogeneity problem by not requiring the system to wait
on the slowest participant.

To enhance data security, training efﬁciency, and accu-
racy, the authors design a hybrid Blockchain mechanism
called PermiDAG. PermiDAG is composed of two hybrid
components: (1) Main permissioned Blockchain and (2) local
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). DAG is a directed graph
data structure that uses topological order and has been
used to improve the efﬁciency and scalability of traditional
Blockchain such as in IoT [176] and 5G beyond networks
[177]. DAG also uses a more efﬁcient cumulative PoW in
lieu of traditional PoW.

In PermiDAG, RSUs maintain main permissioned
Blockchain while vehicles share data using DAG. Main
permissioned Blockchain is responsible for global aggrega-
tion while local DAG is responsible for asynchronous local
training. Under PermiDAG, vehicles train their local models
based on the global model retrieved from main Blockchain.
They also retrieve veriﬁed local models from other vehi-
cles from local DAG. They execute local aggregation to
improve their own local model and then add that model
to local DAG. After several iterations of local training and
aggregation, delegate RSUs collect the current local models
from local DAG and perform global aggregation. The global
model is then broadcasted to all delegates. All global models
are collected into a block by a rotating delegate leader
and the candidate block is appended to the permissioned
Blockchain after veriﬁcation.

4.3.5 Hierarchical Blockchain-Enabled FL for Knowledge
Sharing in IoV

In [154], authors propose a hierarchical Blockchain frame-
work for IoV which utilizes their proposed hierarchical FL
algorithm for knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing [178]
involves vehicles learning environmental data through ML
methods and sharing that learned knowledge with each
other [154]. The authors design their framework to be hi-
erarchical by performing consensus at Ground Chains and
a Top Chain level. For each region, RSUs perform consensus
for vehicle learning models. At the Top Chain level, base
stations perform consensus for the models from each region.
According to the authors, this multi-model approach is more
feasible for knowledge sharing in large scale vehicular net-
works. Using a hierarchical approach, authors’ framework
can more easily manage vehicular networks composed of
multiple regions and where each region has its own varying
local characteristics.

The authors’ work is primarily focused on addressing
the two primary problems of implementing knowledge
sharing in vehicular networks: (1) ensuring the security
and reliability of knowledge shared during the sharing pro-
cess (i.e., prevent poisoning attacks) and (2) privacy issues
involved in storing aggregated knowledge in the central
server (i.e., centralization issue and SPOF attacks). Authors
framework also addresses loyalty challenge by utilizing
a trading market process that stimulates the sharing of
learning models.

To address security and reliability in knowledge sharing,
the authors enhance FL with Blockchain. They propose
a Proof-of-Knowledge (PoK) consensus mechanism that is
light-weight and more efﬁcient than traditional PoW. PoK
combines machine learning (ML) with Blockchain consensus
by replacing the hash puzzle of PoW with a ML process. Un-
like PoW, which selects the fastest solver of the hash puzzle
to propose a new block, PoK is designed to select the best
solver that achieved the most accurate ML result. During
Ground Chain consensus, RSUs verify the training accuracy
of vehicles using a test set. To address the centralization
issue and protect against SPOF attacks, the authors replace
the central server of FL with Blockchain.

4.4 Summary Remarks

This section discussed a new line of work that com-
bines AI and blockchain for IoV. Speciﬁcally, we discussed
blockchain-based FL for IoV. We ﬁrst presented an overview
of FL, their challenges, and how blockchain can be used to
solve these challenges. Then, we discussed recent studies
that had build FL for BIoV, along with thier approaches and
major differences. Table 6 outlines the various approaches
to enhancing traditional FL for vehicular networks with
Blockchain and how such approaches address issues such
as poisoning, membership inference and SPOF attacks. It
describes how each approach addresses issues related to
loyalty and communication efﬁciency.

It should be noted that Blockchain-based FL for IoV is a
recent trend that has gone out in the last two years. Thus,
there exist several challenges with these techniques and
several associated future direction. We will discuss those
brieﬂy in section 5.2

5 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES IN
BIOV

In this section, we discuss the challenges and future op-
portunities in BIoV. In Section 5.1, key issues in BIoV are
highlighted. In Section 5.2, we review challenges and op-
portunities in integrating FL for BIoV.

5.1 BIoV-speciﬁc Challenges and Opportunities

BIoV offers security and mitigates data manipulations due
to data immutability brought by Blockchain. However, due
to openness nature of the Blockchain, it cannot directly
guarantee several issues such as security, trust, and privacy
explained as follows.

Ensuring Trust among entities in IoVs. Trust and pri-
vacy is major issue in IoV as it is hard to believe any entity
in IoVs due to the possibility of malicious behavior as well
as to keep oneâ ˘A ´Zs private identity during communicat-
ing with other vehicles. The limitations of the centralized
trust management system can be solved through distributed
approach using Blockchain but there still major concerns
regarding the trust, privacy and scalability in operation

among the participants in our vehicular network system.
Authors in [26] propose a conditional privacy preserving
announcement scheme integrated with Blockchain to solve
these problems where proof of work and PBFT are used
to make the consensus to reduce the cost. Another work
by [25], that proposes to check the validity of the messages
using Bayesian Interference model and each vehicle with the
source message is given a rating by the message receiver.
Based on the rating provided by vehicles, RSU calculate
trust and make a block using those data and then RSUs
add their blocks in the Blockchain where both PoW and
PoS are used. However, privacy is not well addressed which
mitigates vehicles from sharing their information.

Security and Privacy in BIoV. All the vehicles connected
in IoV, share enormous amount of data for communication
and making decision. For this, it is really important to
provide security and privacy to these shared data which
can be achieved through Blockchain. Due to openness of
public Blockchain, it is hard to achieve this privacy. Ve-
hicular social network (VSN) [179] is also a part of IoV

for reducing communication overhead [180] as well as intro-
duce better consensus algorithm for consortium Blockchain
[181]. Privacy can also be compromised when any of the
transaction made though BTC, link certain identities to their
pseudonyms that is known as linking problem. To solve the
problems related to bitcoin another kind of cryptocurrency
Altcoin is introduced. It can provide ﬁrm privacy with its
advanced security features that need to be focused in future
[182]. Recently, Intel software guard extension (SGX) has
been integrated with the Blockchain based IoV to solve
the existing limitations related to security and privacy. But
the consensus algorithm used in SGX such as PoET [35]
suffer from stale of chip problem which eventually creates
centralization of rights that need to be solved for better
performance [183].

Edge Computing for BIoV challenges and Opportuni-
ties. Fog/edge computing is also required for computing
the data in IoV where it is required to keep the data
integrity which can be improved by a proper combination of
Blockchain, AI and ML [184]–[186]. In IoV, dynamic access
control is required in decentralized system, but it costs high
energy consumption as well as at the same time it is needed
to provide a secured and trusted environment. For solving
this problem, authors [187], propose to leverage Fog/Edge
computing to ensure scalability with energy efﬁciency and
use the edge nodes (RSU) as the mediator between the
sensor nodes (vehicles or end devices) and edge computing.
In this system, ledger entity (RSU) hosts the Blockchain and
with the help of trusted node it will update the trust value
for the to be trusted node (TBTN). This model has only
focused on the trust for the entities not the messages they
share as well as it also suffers from privacy problem and
prone to false praise attacks.

5.2 FL for BIoV Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the many beneﬁts provided by Blockchain-enabled
FL implementations for IoV, these implementations still
suffer from several challenges [188]. Table 7 summarizes
these challenges and it is discussed as follows.

Forking. Forking happens because of network delays,
a vehicle may not always have the most recent block and
consequently create a different chain that branches or "forks"
from the main one [152]. Forking reduces throughput since
only a single chain survives. Forking creates a situation
where some vehicles may utilize wrong global update in
the next iteration of local model update. The work on [152]
analyzed forking issues and its impact on FL on BIoV. Based
on the analysis results, the forking depends on two factors;
block arrival rate and block propagation delay. The work
also developed a mathematical model have been developed
to to capture the FL parameters such as the retransmission
limit, block arrival rate, block size and the frame sizes so as
to capture their impact on the system-level performance.

Aggregation node selection. The process of uploading
and downloading model updates to FL could take a lot
of time especially in complex models with many model
parameters. Thus, the selection of the node responsible
for aggregation and impact of that selection should been
discussed. The work in [169] uses the amount of data as
the indicator for the selection of aggregation nodes in FL.

Description
Vehicle fails to receive most recent block
due to network delay and consequently
creates a different chain that "forks"
from the main one.
Insufﬁcient factors used for selecting
nodes for aggregation.

Vehicles use an uncooperative training
strategy.

Using iterative optimization techniques,
which require many rounds of commu-
nication between local devices (e.g., ve-
hicles) and the central serve.r
Vehicles are reluctant to share models
results because of cyberattacks such as
eavesdropping and spooﬁng attacks.

However, other factors such as the number of computing
resources of the data provider, current power, network
conditions and other factors could also be used to improve
the selection of aggregation nodes. Future research work
could use methods such as model quantization and model
distillation to compress model parameters to improve FL
speed and efﬁciency.

Uncooperative Vehicle Training. This challenge hap-
pens because of some vehicles are not willing to cooperate
in the training phases in the FL. Vehicles need to cooperate
to build a high-quality global model and at the same time
take into consideration communication resource allocation.
The authors in [189] address this issue in the realm of
mobile devices and MEC. They propose a cooperative FL
framework for the MEC system which they call CFLMEC,
where devices transmit local models in a relay fashion
with the goal of maximizing the admission of data at the
edge server or nearby device. A similar framework could
be incorporated into a Blockchain-based FL framework
in vehicular networks to solve the uncooperative training
strategy challenge. Another approach is exploring reputa-
tion and incentives systems to motivate all vehicles to to
cooperate in the training phases in the FL. However, using
reputation systems requires real identity of vehicles and
this leads to another serious problem because vehicles will
be reluctant to cooperate in the training phases because of
private information may be revealed because of adversarial
attacks such as model inversion attacks [190], [191] and
membership inference attacks [192], [193].

Communication and computation Efﬁciency. Current
FL methods involve training models using iterative opti-
mization techniques, which require many rounds of com-
munication between local devices (e.g., vehicles) and the
central server. This tends to lead to bottleneck issues and
increased communication costs. To address this issue, the
authors in [194] proposed a one-shot FL approach, where the
initial global model can be learned from data on the network
in only one round of communication between devices and
the central server. Zhou et al. [195] proposed distilled one-
shot FL (DOSFL), which combines the ideas behind data
distillation [196] and one-shot FL. Data distillation involves
compressing a large dataset with thousands of images into

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDAPLE AND SECURE COMPUTING, VOL. XX, NO. XX, NOVEMBER 2018

19

a few synthetic training images [196]. Realizing that using
this compression method could help reduce communication
cost in FL, Zhou et al. [195] apply distillation to one-shot
FL. Under DOSFL, Each device distills their private dataset
and uploads synthetic data to the central server instead of
sending bulky ML gradients or weights. The central server
then interweaves the distilled data together and uses it to
train the global model. A similar approach could also be
applied to Blockchain-based FL for vehicular networks.

Security and Privacy of FL for BIoV. Vehicles needs to
exchange information during the FL training. Sharing this
data shall be secure against different types of security and
privacy-leakage attacks. The work in [195] designed their FL
to be secure against eavesdropping attacks since an eaves-
dropper cannot reproduce the global model with leaked
distilled data without knowing the exact initial weights
distributed by the server. However, there may still exist
security risks from other attacks such as data poisoning
attacks. Future work could explore the potential attacks
resulted from using Blockchain to secure FL frameworks
against such attacks. Privacy techniques have been pro-
posed to aggregate the model updates, however, an un-
trusted aggregator can maliciously modify the aggregated
result to produce a biased FL model.

5.3 Performance Issues

Performance is major issue when using Blockchain to secure
IoV. Performance can be due to several issues explained as
follows.

Scalability. Blockchain solves the limitations existed in
centralized IoV system though it lags behind due to its poor
performance when the number of vehicles and Blockchain
nodes increases signiﬁcantly [104], [105]. Factors that affect
scalability includes but not limited to block size, number
of transactions, total amount of connected nodes and con-
sensus protocols used [106]. Blocks with huge data packets
cost much storage which leads a poor scalable system [107].
Due to high volume of data, it also results processing delay
and communication delay which eventually degrade the
performance of BIoV as most of the devices connected are
resource constrained [109]. In BIoV, vehicles have to make
transactions which need to be veriﬁed and synchronized
such as in Ethereum it is required to validate each transac-
tion part by part which causes slow speed and scalability
challenges in the whole system [62], [110], [111]. Some
works have discussed using zero-knowledge proves (ZKP)
to solve security and privacy issues in BIoV. However, zero-
knowledge proof (ZKP) can lead to computation intensity
and Scalability issues due to its multiple round veriﬁcation
and limited throughput [9], [197], [198]. With the increas-
ing of number connected vehicles in BIoV, latency is also
incremented because of more computational requirement
and affects throughput in BIoV [199], [200]. Thus, there are
few recent protocols to address Scalability issues in BIoV
but it lead to an increase in latency at the expense of high
scalability [201].

Developing efﬁcient consensus algorithms tailored for
BIoV is an open issue that can lead to improved Scalability.
Delegated byzantine fault tolerance (dBFT) [42] was ﬁrst
proposed by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang for use in their

NEO Blockchain cryptocurrency framework. The dBFT de-
termines validators based on real-time Blockchain voting.
This arrangement provides enhanced efﬁciency such as
faster block time and transaction conﬁrmation. Participant
holders of a NEO token vote on a bookkeeper. The elected
bookkeepers utilize BFT to reach consensus and generate
new blocks. dBFT has been employed by authors such as
[155] for Blockchain-based vehicular networks. Based on
the discussion it is tangible that throughput and latency
ate the two major factors that put a signiﬁcant impact on
the quality of experience (QoE) in BIoV that should be
improved in future research [202], [203]. The work in [204]
uses the shard Blockchain to reduce work loads in main
Blockchain and smart contracts to make it more feasible.
The main idea is that RSUs are responsible for maintaining
and updating the trust of vehicles where proof of work
consensus mechanism is used. Both permissioned and per-
mission less Blockchain is integrated in this model for the
main and shard Blockchain respectively. Though this model
can improve scalability, it is not fully decentralized as some
operations are controlled by Trafﬁc Authority.

Computations Overheads. Performance of any BIoV
depends on computation required. Encryption, decryption,
and signatures that are required for the security purposes
also require mining nodes with high computation. To utilize
the vacant resources outside of Blockchain network such as
cloud/fog computing by the evolutionary miners (E-miner)
who are promoted from traditional miners (T-miner) with
additional abilities for providing extra computing services.
During mining, each vehicle or RSU gets reward but in
PoW based Blockchain networks sometimes miner acts as
malicious node in incentive mechanism step which cause a
waste of distributed computing resources. Zero-determinant
strategy (ZD strategy) [205] is used to solve this challenge to
encourage cooperative mining [206]. Though it doesnâ ˘A ´Zt
take the trust value of the nodes into consideration which
need to be solved in future for secured performance.

Communication Overhead. In IoT a lot of devices are
connected, and they require frequent changes in the prove-
nance data which causes enormous energy consumption
that leads to computation loads, delays, and bandwidth
overhead. With the increasing of the vehicles connected in
IoV, energy needs are limited [207]. That is why Blockchain
network fails to provide good performance due to more
energy consumption, execution time and communication
overhead that need to be improved.

A selective compression scheme has been proposed
to reduce communication overheads using a checkpoint-
chain that can prevent the accumulation of compression.
Enormous number of blocks can be veriﬁed with only a
few updated checkpoints and nodes with limited resources
can reduce the storage volume for the Blockchain ledger
and achieve high veriﬁcation capabilities [208]. A message
passing technology called HPBC has been implemented in
a high performance Blockchain consensus algorithm with
byzantine nodes to solve the resource overhead and long
block conﬁrmation delay [209] but it does not consider pri-
vacy for the nodes as well as the malicious activities inside
the nodes which should be studied to make its performance
better.

Designing Lightweight BIoV Protocols. Security pro-

tocols include but not limited to user authentication, key
management, access control/user access control, and intru-
sion prevention/detection. All these BIoV Protocols uses
several cryptosystems that uses heavy algorithms with
high communications, computations and storage overheads.
Some of the devices in BIoV such as sensors are resource-
constrained and lacks high communications computation,
and storage capabilities [210], [211]. Also, using Blockchain
leads to extra overheads when it requires such capabilities.
Thus, using lightweight cryptosystems can be helpful and
more research is needed to provide lightweight BIoV Pro-
tocols. Another issue is to develop efﬁcient cryptosystems
such as certiﬁcateless signcryption [212] which can achieve
data conﬁdentiality and authentication without relying on a
trusted third party to generate certiﬁcates. However, these
cryptosystems comes with extra commutation and commu-
nication overheads and thus more research is needed to
build lightweight schemes suitable for BIoV environments.

6 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN BIOV
This section focuses on a number of future research direc-
tions in integrating Blockchain in AI, hardware security and
Quantum computing.

6.1 AI

One future direction in the combination of AI and
Blockchains is in the ﬁeld of explainable and responsible
AI. A current challenge in AI systems that hinder their
adaptation in practice is that the decision made by these
systems are untraceable and not explainable to humans. One
solution to resolve this issue is to track the development of
data ﬂow and complex behaviors generated by the system.
An example in IoV is the explaining why a model has stated
that the trafﬁc is congested. Such explanation can come from
tracking data coming sequentially from different roads in
the system. However, providing a traceable and transparent
system that can provide such tracking without breaking user
privacy is challenging. Blockchains can be used to perform
such tasks by tracking every turn in the data-processing or
decision-making chain. Such tracking can understand and
increase conﬁdence in AI decisions. Furthermore, tracking
can be used by humans to trace back the decision process
and justify decisions based on prior history or development.
Lastly, tracking can provide insights into tuning AI systems
to balance models'accuracy with their explainabilities. Of
course, data and model privacy concerns would rise here,
and so we do expect this direction to be directed toward
applications that require only user privacy.

Another direction is to use AI to design lightweight BIoV
protocols. As discussed in Section. 5.3, performance issues
in BIoV is a major issue that need to be addressed to develop
scalable and efﬁcient BIoV. The intelligence from AI can help
resolve these challenges by optimizing communication and
computation overhead and providing the required scalable
and efﬁcient BIoV .

In addition, while the integration of AI and Blockchains
has many promises, it comes with many challenges and
open issues that have been discussed in section 5.2. Solving
these challenges is a future direction to guarantee the suc-
cess of Blockchain-based AI solutions. First and foremost,

as Blockchains support transparency, the data stored in
Blockchains is open and can be accessed by other nodes.
This enforces AI data or model privacy concerns, especially
if the data or model contain sensitive information. Note that
the challenge here is data privacy, or model privacy in the
case of FL, rather than user privacy. As discussed before,
user privacy can be solved with the use of Blockchains. Solu-
tions to data or model privacy can use private Blockchains to
resolve this challenge. However, these solutions come with
the limitations of providing heterogeneous environments,
sometimes necessary for IoV. While the work in [156] and
[155] have proposed privacy-preserving Blockchain solu-
tions, these solutions are still insufﬁcient and at an early
stage. Thus, a future direction should focus on Blockchain
and AI integration while keeping the AI data or model
private.

Another active research direction is the use of AI for
Blockchains,
i.e., building intelligent self-generated con-
tracts, designing better AI-based mining techniques, and
detecting malicious behavior and threats in Blockchains
using AI techniques. This speciﬁc direction is a more general
blockchain systems future direction and not speciﬁc to BIoV.
However, we believe that such direction will revolutionize
Blockchains and so it is important to be mentioned as a
future direction.

6.2 Hardware Security

The IoV relies on embedded hardware, real-time sensors,
ECUs, and printed circuit board (PCB), etc. to communi-
cate critical information using the internet efﬁciently. The
modern supply chain allows for the IoV embedded hard-
ware to be designed, fabricated, assembled, and tested at
different locations across the globe involving multiple un-
trusted parties, making the designed intellectual propriety
(IP) inherently insecure. When the intellectual property (IP)
of the IoV embedded hardware is not entirely secure and
trusted, no security solution at a higher level of abstraction
can protect the entire system. In that case, an attacker may
utilize a chip level venerability to access the and retrieve
critical information, i.e., the owner’s personal information,
vehicle data, route map, etc., or harm/steal this information.
Therefore, the protection of the IoV embedded hardware
against the evolving hardware attacks is becoming crucial.

At the hardware level, our future direction aims to cover
novel security approaches that integrate Physical Unalien-
able Functions (PUFs) and the state of the art topic in
hardware-based security with the Blockchain technology
for secure, trusted, and reliable BIoV embedded hardware.
For example, recent research proposes Hardware-Assisted
Blockchain (PUFchain) for sustainable simultaneous device
and data security in the internet of everything (IoE) [213].
The framework can be deployed in connected vehicles and
autonomous networks to employee PUF-based hardware
security with multiple roles in the BIoV, including enhanced
low-cost authentication, lower latency, and lightweight low
energy consumption. Further, the integration of hardware-
based security will enable trust in IoV application at the
hardware level and countermeasure against physical and
embedded systems attacks, reverse engineering, hardware
obfuscation, and hardware counterfeit detection and pre-
vention.

21

At the communication level, our future directions aim to
integrate novel hardware security solutions and Blockchain
technology to strengthen IoV Controller Area Network
(CAN) security. Such secure solutions will ensure the au-
thenticity and reliability of the messages sent over the
IoV network and processes by CAN-based bus architec-
ture [214], [215]. In this regard, hardware-based security
is helpful for key generation and message authentication,
including obtaining a robust, unique, and reliable hardware-
based shared key between ECUs, allowing all message paths
to be securely encrypted. Additionally, hardware security
enable obtaining true random number generation (TRNGs)
used for robust a hash-based message authentication code
(HMAC) system with a counter to help protect the BIoV sys-
tem against replay attacks and message tampering attempts.
A hardware-assisted security technique proposed as a
delay-based plug-in-monitor for intrusion detection in IoV
controller area network (CAN) topology [216]. The pro-
posed intrusion detection method prototype can be im-
plemented efﬁciently on re-conﬁgurable platforms, Filed
Programmable gate Arrays (FPGAs), and embedded micro-
controllers that are part of the CAN bus shields. Such a
hardware-based BIoV scheme protects the integrity of the
messages on CAN buses leading to a further improve the
security and safety of autonomous vehicles. This future
direction will address the delay-based hardware-assisted
security techniques against malicious hardware modiﬁca-
tions, including remote hardware Trojan (RATs) and fault
injection attacks, stressing the need to protect BIoV against
such emerging hardware attacks.

6.3 Quantum Computing Attacks

Quantum computing is a ﬁeld that is based on quantum
theory which explains the nature and behavior of energy
and matter on the quantum (atomic and subatomic) level.
Quantum computers get their unique power through the
ability for bits to be in multiple states at one time, where
tasks can be performed using a combination of 1’s, 0’s and
both a 1 and 0 simultaneously [217]. The work in [218],
[219] discussed how quantum computers may attack proof-
of-stake blockchains. The work has showed that PoW is
safer than proof of stake because hash functions are less
vulnerable quantum computers. The work has showed also
attacks on PoS blockchains using both Grover's algorithm
[220] and Shor's algorithm [221]. The authors demonstrated
that quantum computing algorithms are capable of solving
speciﬁc problems more efﬁciently than traditional com-
puting algorithms. The work has recommended quantum
resilient signature schemes to mitigate them. On the other
hand, Blockchain uses one-way cryptographic hashing to
secure transactions. However, quantum computing algo-
rithms may one day be able to break blockchain’s one-way
cryptography. Thus, Quantum attacks has gained recently
active attention from researcher [222], [223], but BIoV net-
work shall be well designed and be quantum-resistant to be
secure against 51% and byzantine attacks.
