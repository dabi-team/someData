Abstract 
Decentralized  Autonomous  Organization  (DAO)  is  very  popular  in  Decentralized  Finance  (DeFi) 
applications  as  it  provides  a  decentralized  governance  solution  through  blockchain. We  analyze  the 
governance characteristics in the relevant Maker protocol and its stablecoin Dai (DAI) and governance 
token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. 
Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related 
to MKR, DAI and Ethereum, such as financial, transaction, exchange, network and twitter sentiment 
indicators.  Our  results  show  that  governance  centralization  influences  both  Maker  protocol  and 
Ethereum blockchain. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO 
very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between efficiency and decentralization. This 
further contribute in the contemporary debate on whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.

1.  Introduction 

As Bitcoin was proposed in 2008 (Nakamoto, 2008), blockchain has deeply changed financial markets. 
The main disruption lies in the disintermediation of financial institutions from their centralized role. 
The  absence  of  centralized  third  parties,  e.g.,  central  banks,  in  the  blockchain  universe  and 
circumventing  traditional  barriers  of  financial  markets’  participation  are  the  major  attributes  of  this 
market revolution. Decentralization, therefore, is logically regarded as the core value proposition of 
blockchain (Harvey et al., 2021).  

Decentralized  Finance  (DeFi)  is  blockchain-based  financial  applications  which  are  designed  to 
replicate most financial activities, e.g., lending and borrowing, in the traditional markets. Theoretically, 
governance  in  DeFi  is  decentralized  since  all  members  are  decision  makers.  In  traditional  finance, 
governance is inevitably centralized, which can be the origin of several problems. The most intractable 
issue is probably agency problem, where the owners and managers of an organization have different 
interests (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Managers  can pursue their own profits in the expense of the 
owners’  benefits.  Therefore,  the  most  challenging  objective  of  governance  is  to  align  the  interests 
between owners and managers (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Within the DeFi context, though, owners and 
managers are theoretically identical, which creates an opportunity to investigate the premises of this 
theory once again.  

Stemming  from  this  background,  the  most  contemporary  debate  on  DeFi,  interestingly,  remains 
whether decentralization is realistic or an illusion (Aramonte et al., 2021). DeFi platforms showcase 
elements of centralization, usually in the form of ‘governance tokens’ and power concentration to large 
coin-holders.  This  phenomenon  can  lead  to  collusion  among  core  decision  makers  during  the 
governance  process.  It  is  obvious,  then,  that  governance  becomes  a  very  critical  dimension  of  the 
success of true decentralization in blockchain. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is one 
popular  solution  to  decentralized  governance  and  decision  making  (Jentzch,  2017).  In  a  DAO,  all 
members are the owners of the organization and they have decision-making power to the development 
of it. Usually, the suggested changes will be written in the form of an Improvement Proposal, which 
then  is  voted  through  an  established  poll,  where  all  members  can  make  public  their  option.  DAO 
members choose their option through governance tokens.  Usually, these governance tokens are also 
tradable cryptocurrencies. The votes are weighted by the amount of governance token held by voters. 
In  other  words,  governance  in  DAO  is tokenized.  Currently,  DAO is the most  common governance 
mechanism adopted by DeFi. 

The literature of governance in blockchain is voluminous. Usually, when it comes to blockchain, the 
debate evolves around the trade-off between decentralization and efficiency. Decentralization will result 
in lower speed of decision-making process, implying that the network becomes inefficiency (Hsieh et 
al.,  2017).  Yermack  (2017)  argued  that  in  practice,  blockchain  governance  is  not  completely 
decentralized.  In  some  extreme  cases,  the  final  decision  is  taken  by  only  the  core  developers.  For 
example, Bitcoin core developers once decided to lower the transaction fees without discussing with 
community  (Gervais  et  al.,  2014).  Cong  et  al.  (2021)  discuss  the  issue  from  the  perspective  of 
centralized  mining  and  suggest  that  centralized  pools  designed  for  risk  sharing  could  act  as 
centralization force in the Bitcoin blockchain. Though several papers provide both theoretical models 
and empirical evidence of governance centralization in blockchain, the literature surprisingly remains 
silent when it comes to centralization in DeFi. 

Positioning the centralized governance debate in the DeFi universe at the forefront of the literature is 
the  main  motivation  of  this  paper. We  focus  on  the  DeFi  platform,  Maker  protocol,  developed  and 
managed by MakerDAO, as a case study. The rational behind this choice is simple. MakerDAO is one 
of the most influential DAOs. Since 2017, when the DeFi universe expanded exponentially, the Maker 
protocol has emerged as the leading lending protocol, which conceptually replicates the operation of a 
bank in cryptocurrency markets. In the Maker protocol, Maker (MKR) is the governance token. In terms 

2 

 
of its value, one token equals to one vote in the proposed polls. Except from this tokenized value, Maker 
protocol issues the DAI, which is a stablecoin soft-pegged to US Dollar (Maker, 2021). Currently, DAI 
is one of the most traded stablecoins1. Although the Maker protocol seems to be a big success of DAO, 
the way it is governed in practice has not been rigidly examined. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first paper that focuses on providing empirical evidence of centralized governance in DeFi.  

To achieve that, we collect information for the Maker protocol governance, including all voters, their 
choice, and votes in Maker governance polls from 5th August  2019 to 22nd October 2021. Our empirical 
analysis  follows  two  stages. The  first  stage  is  to  examine  governance  polls  by  defining  three  novel 
measurements of centralized governance, namely voting participation, centralized voting power, and 
voting  efficiency.  In  the  second  stage,  we  investigate  effect  of  centralized  governance  to  the 
development  of  the  Maker  protocol.  To  achieve  this,  we  expose  MKR  and  DAI  to  several  Maker-
specific factors. These factors can be divided into several categories, including financial, transaction, 
exchange, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Such an empirical setup is consistent with similar 
studies in the field, such as Liu and Tsyvinski (2021). Beside well-investigated factors, e.g., network 
factors, we also consider transaction demand, which is a theoretical determinant of token price (Cong, 
Li  and  Wang,  2021).  Intuitively,  transaction  factors  may  relate  to  governance  in  DeFi.  Besides, 
exchange  factors  help  to  illustrate  how  Ethereum,  as  an  underlying  blockchain,  interacts  with 
cryptocurrency exchanges, where various cryptocurrencies are traded. Finally, since the Maker protocol 
is on Ethereum blockchain, governance centralization may also have influence on the blockchain. For 
that reason, we also investigate the correlation between centralized governance proxies and equivalent 
Ether (ETH) statistics, which is the underlying cryptocurrency of Ethereum.  

The empirical framework brings forward some very interesting findings. By examining governance 
polls in the Maker protocol, we observe signals of centralized Maker governance. Comparing with the 
rapidly increasing number of users, voters are centralized in a small group of members, and the most 
dominant  voters  are  heterogeneous  in  characteristics  in  different  criteria.  The  unevenly  distributed 
voting  power,  as  a  preliminary  signal  of  governance  centralization,  leads  to  our  measurements  of 
governance  centralization  in  Maker  protocol.  By  applying  factor  analysis,  we  find  that  effects  of 
centralized  governance  are  complex,  and  most  empirical results are  around  voting  participation and 
efficiency  of  decision  making.  Intuitively,  more  voters  and  total  votes  are  signals  of  larger  voting 
participation, implying more decentralized governance. The second stage results are found consistent 
with this conjecture. First, voting participation can directly affect financial factors of MKR and DAI. 
For  example,  the  MKR  price  increases  with  more  voters  and  total  votes  in  governance  polls.  More 
numbers of voters can result in higher volatility of DAI.  This suggests that the stablecoin can be affected 
from the participation in the polls and that decentralized governance could reduce its reliability. Second, 
after expanding our work on other indicators, we find centralized governance can lower the adoption of 
Maker Protocol. When users discard centralized MakerDAO, the long-term growth of Maker protocol 
will not be optimistic. Our findings may apply to other DAO-governed DeFi platforms as well. Finally, 
voting efficiency appears to play a significant role towards the boost of the Maker Protocol development, 
and better efficiency, e.g., shorter time of decision-making process, may bring more users, transactions, 
and  positive  discussion.  Overall,  we  find  that  both  the  degree  of  centralized  governance  and  its 
efficiency, posing a relevant trade-off among DeFi investors. 

The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the governance 
process  in  MakerDAO.  The  dataset  and  the  measurements  of  centralized  governance  in  the  Maker 
protocol are defined in section 3. The main empirical results are presented in section 4, while robustness 
checks are provided in section 5. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks. Finally, the appendix 
provides a description of the utilized factors, the ETH related analysis and robustness checks using an 
instrumental variable.

is more than 10 thousand.

2. Governance in the Maker protocol 

2.1 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), MakerDAO and Maker protocol 

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a novel mechanism of organizational governance 
and decision-making. The DAO white paper is first given by Jentzsch (2017). Technically, DAO can be 
deployed  on  blockchain,  and  currently,  most  DAOs  rely  on  Ethereum,  which  is  a  programmable 
blockchain. Ethereum yellow paper is introduced by Wood (2021), and Ethereum users can write smart 
contracts  in Turing-complete  programming  language,  e.g.,  Solidity.  By  writing  and  executing  smart 
contracts, users can actualize various interactions and functions, e.g., transactions, on Ethereum (Atzei, 
Bartoletti and Cimoli, 2017). The programmable character enables the implementation of DAO. It is to 
say, the core of DAO governance is based on standard smart contract code instead of human actors. In 
DAO,  the  governance  is  tokenized.  In  practice,  DAO-based  protocols  usually  have  their  own 
governance token, and governance token holders can vote on changes to the protocols.  

MakerDAO is created in 2014, and it has grown up to one of the most influential DAOs. The Maker 
protocol  is  multi-collateral  lending  system,  and  the  protocol  is  governed  by  MakerDAO  teams, 
including individuals and service providers (Maker, 2021). Based on the functions of Maker protocol, 
the  protocol  is  usually  categorized  as  a  lending  protocol  (LP),  resembling  banks  in  cryptocurrency 
markets (Gudgeon et al., 2020). Simply, users can lend their tokens to LPs for economic incentives, e.g., 
interests. On the other hand, users can borrow tokens, and LPs usually require collateralization. The 
economic  mechanism,  mathematical  models  and  the  roles  of  LPs  are  well  discussed  by  Bartoletti, 
Chiang and Lluch-Lafuente (2020). Maker protocol issues Dai (DAI), and the protocol is de facto a 
Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) system. Dai is probably the most notable stablecoin, which is soft-pegged 
to  the  US  dollar  (Maker,  2021).  Generally,  stablecoins  are  cryptoassets  that  aim  for  price  stability 
(Werner et al., 2021). Usually, stablecoins are pegged to a currency, e.g., US dollar. Multi-Collateral 
Dai was launched in Nov 2019. In Maker, a user can lock any supportive collateral, e.g., Ether (ETH), 
and a corresponding amount of Dai will be generated as debt. More details of DAI debt in Maker are 
given by Qin et al. (2021). As of Nov, 2021, the market cap of Dai has been more than $6.4 million.  

Issued by Maker protocol, Maker (MKR) is known as the governance token. In practice, MKR plays 
two roles. First, MKR is the governance token of Maker protocol, and MKR holders can vote on changes 
to  the  protocol.  On  the  other  hand,  MKR  contributes  to  the  recapitalization  of  the  system.  MKR  is 
created or destroyed through the automated auction mechanism of Maker protocol. When the debt of 
protocol is outstanding, MKR is created and sold for Dai. By contrast, the protocol sells Dai for MKR, 
and the surplus MKR will be destroyed. At the inception of MakerDAO, 1 million MKR were issued. 
The protocol sets a threshold of minimum and maximum of MKR, and the total circulated MKR will 
fluctuate between the thresholds. 

2.2 Maker governance structure and voting process 

An innovative selling point of the Maker protocol is decentralized governance. In the Maker protocol, 
governance can be divided into two parts: on-chain governance and off-chain governance. In on-chain 
governance, there are two types of votes, namely the Governance Polls and Executive Votes. Any MKR 
holders can vote using the Maker Protocol’s on-chain governance system. Governance polls, which are 
about  non-technical  changes,  measure  the  sentiment  of  MKR  holders.  Executive  votes  “execute” 
technical  changes  to  the  protocol.  The  voting  results  are  documented  on  blockchain.  Off-chain 
governance is mainly about informal discussion, e.g., discussion on the MakerDAO forum. Both MKR 
holders and the larger community can express their opinions. Voting power is weighted by the amount 
of MKR that a voter owns and represents. One MKR equals to one vote. Finally, the option with the 
largest votes wins. In the Maker protocol,  Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) are structured and 

4 

 
formalized for a voting event, and key issues and changes to the system are rigidly defined in MIPs. 
Usually, the Maker Foundation will draft the initial MIPs, and any community members can propose 
competing MIPs. Then, the final decisions will be made by MKR voters through the current Maker 
governance process. The above information is illustrated in the following figure. 

[Figure 1] 
MKR holders can be voters and directly choose their options on Maker Governance Portal. On the 
other  hand,  they  can  choose  a  Vote  Delegate  to  be  their  representatives  (Maker,  2021). As  a  result, 
delegates gain voting power from MKR holders, and these MKR holders can indirectly vote. One MKR 
equals to one vote. The voters can express their preference of MIPs by voting, and they do not have to 
participate in voting if they do not agree to any MIPs in a poll. The voting results are weighted by the 
amount  of  MKR  voted  for  a  proposal.  Noticeably,  Vote  Delegates  were  not  introduced  in  the  very 
beginning. On July 30th 2021, the guidance to Vote Delegates was first introduced in the Maker forum, 
while on 10th November 2021, there are 16 Delegates and 65989.65 MKR are delegated. Currently, 
there are three types of voting in Maker governance, i.e., Forum Signal Threads, Governance Polls and 
Executive Votes. These are summarized on the following table. 

[Table 1] 
Table  1  highlights  the  functions  of  the  three  types  of  votes.  Forum  Signal  Threads  are  the  least 
consequential, and the threads are a part of off-chain governance. Governance Polls and Executive Votes 
occur  on-chain,  and  they  can  be  accessed  through  the  Maker  Foundation’s  Voting  portal.  Simply, 
Governance  Polls  determine  processes  outside  the  technical  layer,  while  Executive Votes  are  about 
technical changes to the protocol. Executive Votes use 'Continuous Approval Voting' model to make the 
system more secure. The voting models means that new proposals need to surpass the voting weight of 
the last successful proposal (Maker, 2021). 

2.3 Governance centralization 

Centralization in the governance layer of blockchain has caused attention of academic audience, and 
the discussion mainly focuses on two problems, namely owner control and improvement protocol (Sai 
et al., 2021). In Bitcoin, Gervais et al. (2014) argue that the author Satoshi Nakamoto may accumulate 
significant Bitcoin since Nakamoto participated in activities at the early stage of Bitcoin blockchain. 
Similar evidence of owner control exists in Ethereum as well (Bai et al, 2020). The large proportion of 
wealth may result in economic manipulation in blockchain. As for improvement protocol, this problem 
derives from the process of moderation in blockchain. Usually, blockchain and DeFi adopt improvement 
proposal system in decision making process. By analyzing the authors and contributors of improvement 
proposals, Azouvi et al. (2018) found that core developers are the main contributors to the development 
of Bitcoin and Ethereum. In other words, these core developers have more decision-making power in 
the decision-making process.  

Beside the two problems described above, DAO, as a new organizational form to automate governance, 
may bring both opportunities and challenges. Benefiting from blockchain technology, the ownership is 
more transparent and voting can be more accurate (Yermack, 2017). On the other hand, centralization 
seems to be still inevitable in DAO. Gu et al. (2021) found that Maker Governance Polls do not attract 
much participation and MKR held by the dominant voters may theoretically lead to collusion in some 
poll. Yet, they only use two polls as examples. This is not enough to showcase robustly the existence of 
centralized governance in MakerDAO. The quest to obtain information from more polls is achieved in 
this study as the following data collection section shows.

3. Data collection and identification 

3.1 Data Collection 

In Maker Governance Portal2, the details of governance polls, e.g., the number of voters and results, 
are  publicly  available. To  get  the  voters’  addresses,  we  query  the  voting  history  from  MCD  Voting 
Tracker3. We investigate governance polls from Poll 16 (deployed on  15th August 2019) to Poll 663 
(deployed on 22nd October 2021). The dates when the polls are deployed are used which correspond to 
when the transactions are added to Ethereum blockchain. Though the dates might be earlier than the 
start dates when voters can choose options, the contents of polls are already publicly accessible once 
the polls are sent to the blockchain. Poll 16 is the first governance poll that MKR holders can participate 
in. Some polls failed4, so they are not documented in Maker Governance Portal. Hence, the dataset 
consists of a total of 638 successful governance polls, and the voters’ public names can be found by 
searching for their addresses on Etherscan.io and Maker Governance Portal. To study the effects of 
centralization in Maker governance, we consider two influential crypto assets issued by Maker protocol, 
namely MKR and DAI. The statistics of these two crypto assets can be obtained on IntoTheBlock.  

3.2 Measurements of centralized voting power in Maker governance polls 

This section  introduces the novel measurements of centralized voting power in Maker governance 
polls. For each measurement, we first calculate the value at the poll level. Then, daily measurements 
can  be  generated.  Here,  measurements  can  fall  into  three  categories,  i.e.,  voting  participation, 
centralized voting power, and voting efficiency. 

3.2.1 Voting participation 

To proxy voting participation, we use two measurements. One is total votes of Maker governance 
polls on a given date. The other is the number of total voters on a given date. Intuitively, when these 
two measurements are higher, there are more voters and votes in governance polls. 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 polls on a date 𝑑, we have 

and 

𝑛
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑑 =   ∑ 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖,𝑑
𝑖=1

  (1) 

𝑛
𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑑 =   ∑ 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖,𝑑
𝑖=1

 (2) 

3.2.2 Centralized voting power 

In order to capture centralized voting power, we utilize two measures. The first is the Gini coefficient 

which is traditionally used to measure inequality (Dorfman, 1979). 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 voters in a governance poll, we have 

2 https://vote.makerdao.com/ 
3 https://beta.mcdgov.info/ 
4 Poll 28, 39, 47, 69, 78, 183, 282, 284, 286, and 500 failed.

𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 =  

𝑛
𝑖=1

𝑛
𝑗=1

∑ ∑ |𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖 − 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑗|
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
2𝑛2𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠

(3) 

Where 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑖 is the votes of voter 𝑖, and  𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠

̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ is the average votes in a governance poll. 

After computing the gini coefficient for each poll, we can calculate a daily measurement by calculating 

average. 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 polls on a date 𝑑, we will calculate daily gini coefficient, i.e., 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑑, via 

maximum likelihood estimation, and the detailed method is given by Taleb (2015). 

The second proxy for centralized voting power is the largest voter’s power in Maker governance polls. 
This can be approximated by either the 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 or the 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑛. In that way, 
we can reflect also on the relative voting power of the largest voter. For each poll, 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 refers to the 
voting order of the largest voter. When 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 is smaller, the largest voter will choose their option earlier. 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 polls on a date 𝑑, we have 

𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 =  

𝑛
𝑖=1

∑ 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖,𝑑
𝑛

(5) 

For each poll, we define a variable to measure whether the largest voter wins. 

𝑖𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛 =   {

1, 𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑎𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑙
0, 𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑎 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑙

Then, 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 and 𝑖𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛 can be combined to measure the voting power of the largest 

voters when they win. 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 polls on a date 𝑑, we have 

𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖,𝑑 = 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑖,𝑑 × 𝑖𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖,𝑑(6) 

And 

𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 =  

𝑛
𝑖=1

∑ 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖,𝑑
𝑛

(7) 

Finally,  the  voting  sequence  can  actually  play  a  role  as  this  can  be  documented  in  several  voting 
systems (see amongst others, Börgers (2010), Brams (2008), and Brams and Fishburn (2002)). Simply, 
voters have different strategies, and their preference of voting order will vary with their goals. For each 
poll, we define a variable 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 to measure the decision speed of the largest voter. Here, the order of 
the largest voter refers to the order in the whole history. It is to say, the largest voters may change their 
choice later. Assuming that there are 𝑛 records in the voting history of a governance poll, we have 

𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 =  

𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑣𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟
 𝑛

(8) 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 polls on a date 𝑑, we have 

𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑑 =  

𝑛
𝑖=1

∑ 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖,𝑑
𝑛

(9) 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When 𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 is smaller, the largest voter chooses an option earlier than other voters. All voters can 

see the existing choices on the website. 

3.2.3 Voting Efficiency  

The last measurement of centralized governance is the voting efficiency, which proxies the efficiency 
of decision-making process. Here, for each poll, we calculate the total time that all voters need to make 
decisions.  By  summing  up,  we  will  get  the  measurement 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 .  When 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑  is  higher,  decision-
making process is more efficient. 

For voter 𝑖 in a poll 𝑗 deployed on date 𝑑, the voter’s speed is defined as 

𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑖,𝑗,𝑑 =  𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑖,𝑗,𝑑 − 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑗,𝑑(10) 

Where  𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑖,𝑗,𝑑  is  the  time  point  when  voter  𝑖  gives  their  final  choice  for  poll  𝑗 ,  and 

𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑗,𝑑 is the timestamp when poll 𝑗 is deployed on the blockchain. 

Assuming that there are 𝑛 voters in poll 𝑗, we have 

𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑗,𝑑 =

1
𝑛

𝑛
∑ 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑖,𝑗,𝑑
𝑖=1

(11) 

Assuming there are 𝑚 polls on date 𝑑, the daily measurement of speed is 

𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑 =

1
𝑚

𝑚
∑ 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑗,𝑑
𝑗=1

(12) 

4. Empirical results 

This  section  summarizes  the  empirical  results  of  this  study.  The  first  sub-section  presents  the 
descriptive statistics  of both  polls  and  voters. Then,  the  centralization  in Maker  governance  polls  is 
described by the calculations of the measurements of centralized governance defined in the previous 
sections. The second sub-section summarizes the factor analysis we perform to investigate the effects 
of centralized governance on the Maker protocol (MKR and DAI).  

4.1 First stage: Governance polls in the Maker protocol 

The collected information from the 638 governance polls is crucial for understanding centralization 

in Maker protocol. Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics of these polls. 

[Table 2] 
The  votes  are  calculated  in  MKR  tokens  and  for  each  governance  poll,  breakdown  ratio  is  the 
proportion of breakdown votes to total votes. Beside the votes and vote share of the largest voter, the 
order of voting is considered. We also present the daily number of governance polls and voters in figure 
2. 

[Figures 2] 
From the figures we can easily see that within a day, the number of deployed polls is usually less than 
25. Usually, no more than 700 voters will express their choices on the same day. For some polls, no 
more than ten voters will participate in decision making process. The finding implies that not all polls 
can have large voting participation. Compared to the rapidly growth of Maker users, voters are a small 
group. Our analysis extracts a total of 1250 unique voters in our dataset. For each voter, the number of 
polls that they participate in can be surprisingly different. To show case this we present the following 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
descriptive statistics. 

[Table 3] 
By examining the total votes and the highest votes that a voter has in a single poll, it is implied that 
the  voting  power  is  not  equally  distributed  across  voters.  This  could  be  an  early  sign  of  voting 
centralization. However, to make this claim clearer, we need to delve deeper in the composition of the 
voters and their characteristics. To that end, we identify the voters whose identity is publicly available, 
the top ten voters that participate in most polls, the top ten voters that largest total votes and the top ten 
voters that have the largest single vote. This information is summarized in the following tables. 

[Tables 4-7] 
These  tables  present  some  interesting  findings  towards  identifying  centralized  governance  in  the 
Maker protocol. Table 4 shows that except a16z5, the known voters are delegates in Maker governance 
and their identity is publicly available on Maker governance portal. Table 4 gives more details of these 
known voters in governance polls. The mechanism of voting delegates was introduced in July 2021, 
therefore, most delegates participated in their poll in August 2021. Noticeably, the total votes and the 
highest votes in a single poll are different among these known voters. Field Technologies, Inc. is the 
known  voter  that  has  the  largest  total  votes  (as  of  November  1st,  2021).  In  terms  of  voters  that  are 
participating in most polls, it is obvious that their characteristics are different, while none of them has 
a public name, i.e., their identity is unknown. Voters with the largest total votes are again heterogeneous 
in characteristics, while only two from the top ten are found to be delegates (Field Technologies, Inc. 
and  a  shadow  delegate). When  accounting  the  voters  with  the  largest  single  votes,  we  find  again  a 
different composition. We identify delegates such as Field Technologies, Inc., Flip Flop Flap Delegate 
LLC, a shadow delegate and a16z being dominant, while the remaining voters appear with unknown 
identities. Taking a wholistic look at these findings, we notice that some voters may participate in many 
polls  and  have  large  total  votes at  the  same  time,  namely  voters  with  the  addresses  0x4f…3f30  and 
0x6a…ab40. In other cases, some voters might not participate in many polls, but when they do they 
have significantly large votes in certain polls. For example, a16z only votes for three polls, but their 
single votes are more than 30,000. These characteristics of the dominant voters suggested that on-chain 
developments on the protocol are driven by dominant voters and that decentralization does not seem to 
hold. Voting power appears to be distributed unevenly across different known or unknown small groups 
of voters, especially when total votes and large votes in a single poll are considered. 

In order to further show this, we focus now on the notion of centralized voting power in the Maker 
polls. We compare the largest vote for each poll with the total votes and we find that the largest voter 
can account for a significant share of the total votes in most polls. Practically, the largest voter is the 
pivotal figure in implementing protocol changes, as they tend to account for around  one third of the 
voting share. In terms of the known voters (namely delegates and  a16z), the trend is similar. These 
known voters are identified after the delegate regulation change in Maker protocol (after Poll 600) and 
their dominant power is evident. However, it is hard to say if they were able to play an important role 
in previous polls. All this information is illustrated in the following figure.  

[Figure 3] 
To support the above, we also illustrate the total votes over the breakdown votes and their respective 
voters, the breakdown ratio, the voting share of the largest voter and average voting share of the largest 
voter  daily. The  results  show  that  winning  polls  are  driven  by  most  votes,  largest  voters  contribute 
significant votes to the winning options, while largest voters consistently concentrate at least 30% of 
the average daily voting share. These voting patterns are presented in the online Appendix OA.1. The 
key message remains that centralized voting power, hence, exists.  

Although the above could be though descriptive information extracted from our unique dataset, we 
take further steps to quantitatively establish centralized governance on the Maker protocol. Firstly, we

capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which is the most influential venture capital in DeFi markets.

measure the centralized voting power in Maker governance at a poll level and across days by utilizing 
the gini coefficient estimations. The results are summarized in the table and figure that follows.  

[Table 8] [Figure 4]  
At a poll level, we find that the gini coefficient is always more than 50% and exhibits a maximum of 
98.05%.  Given  that  the  gini  coefficient  estimation  is  higher  than  0.60  for  most  of  the  polls,  highly 
centralized voting power in the Maker governance is established. We also calculate and illustrate the 
daily  gini  coefficient.  The  expected  daily  average  gini  coefficient  should  be  around  zero,  if  no 
centralized voting occurs. However, we observe that there are days that the value is higher than 0.75, 
implying again strong centralization of voting power in particular days within our period under study. 
We  further  highlight  the  evidence  of  vote  centralization  by  estimating  the  Lorenz  curve  of  the 
cumulative total votes for particular polls. The results support the above findings and are presented also 
in the online Appendix.  

Finally, the other measurements of governance centralization are established based on the definitions 

given in Section 3. Their descriptive statistics are provided in the following table.  

[Table 9] 

4.2 Second stage: Factor analysis 

In this section, we will apply a series of univariate regressions, with MKR and DAI used as dependent 
variables  and  the  measurements  of  centralized  governance  as  independent  variables.  We  consider 
financial, transaction, network, exchange, and Twitter sentiment factors. In other words, we estimate 
the following regressions: 

𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑡 + 𝜀𝑡(13) 

Where: 
• 
•  𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑡 = {𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑡, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡, 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑡, 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑡, 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑡, 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑡, 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡} 

𝑖 = {𝑀𝐾𝑅, 𝐷𝐴𝐼} 

Given 𝑖, factors can be defined as a set: 

 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = {𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑖,𝑗,𝑡, 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖,𝑘,𝑡, 𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖,𝑙,𝑡, 𝑒𝑥𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑚,𝑡, 𝑇𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖,𝑛,𝑡} 

Where 𝑗 = 1, …, 11, 𝑘 = 1, … , 9, 𝑙 = 1, … , 4, 𝑚 = 1, … ,10, and 𝑛 = 1, … ,3. 

The detailed description of the above set of factors is presented in detail in the Appendix A.1. 

4.2.1 Financial factors 

Maker governance polls are directly related to non-technical changes, e.g., adding a new collateral, to 
Maker  protocol.  These  changes  will  add  more  financial  functions  or  revise  the  parameters  of 
transactions on the protocol. Therefore, it is crucial to examine whether MKR and DAI factors, such as 
daily prices, returns and volatilities are going to be affected by centralized governance, in the form of 
the metrics discussed in section 3. The univariate regression findings for these factors are summarized 
in the following table. 

[Table 10]  

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  two  panels  of  the  table  bring  forward  some  interesting  findings  for  the  effects  of  centralized 
governance measures for MKR and DAI. We observe that 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠, and 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 haved a 
significant positive effect in the MKR price, while 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 and 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 the opposite. 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 tends 
to  positively  affect  long-term  volatility,  while  higher 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 has  a  negative  effect  in  short-term  and 
long-term volatility. This conceptually means that, when governance polls attract more voters, the price 
will be higher. However, decentralized voting power may result in  higher volatility. This could be a 
finding towards the claimed value proposition of MakerDAO, i.e., decentralized governance. However, 
the higher speed of voters is found to be a significant booster for the MKR price, which is a signal of 
centralization of power. The quicker the vote, the higher the voting efficiency in terms of implementing 
change. This  is  evidence  of  centralized  governance.  Here  it  should  be  noted  that  more  voters  are  a 
symbol of decentralized governance, and the associated volatility increase could be attributed to the fact 
that voters hold different opinions on the polls and react unpredictable if the polls’ outcomes do or do 
not meet their expectations. However, the voting order can mitigate this issue for MKR. That is because 
the largest voters tend to vote after observing other voters’ choice and therefore the uncertainty of a 
poll’s results is not high. When the uncertainty of a poll that aims to implement change on the protocol 
is low, then this should be reflected in the short-term and long-term volatility of MKR’s price. We also 
observe that as the daily gini coefficient has a significant negative effect to the MKR price.  

For the case of DAI, we continue to observe significant effects of centralized governance. 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 and 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠 lead to a significant decrease of the DAI price. Here, the effect is opposite compared to 
MKR, which could be attributed to the fact that DAI is the stablecoin counterpart of MKR and it can 
attract more attention from DAO. Additionally, higher Order also lowers DAI volatility. It is normal 
again that after observing other voters’ choices, the largest voters are more certain about the winning 
option, the quicker the Maker community can account for the future changes in the Maker Protocol. As 
DAI  is  issued  by  Maker,  DAI’s  volatility  is  expected  to  decrease  as  well. All  the  above  show  that 
centralized  governance  is  significantly  evident  for  the  financial  factors  relevant  to  MKR  and  DAI. 
Especially, in the case of MKR all centralized measures appear to affect at least one financial factor 
significantly. Although the financial characteristics of coins are quite important, the literature has shown 
that the researcher needs to expand on other indicators integral to the technical structure of coins, tokens 
and protocols in order to capture their potential fundamental value (Kraaijeveld and De Smedt, 2020; 
Nadler and Guo, 2020; Liu and Tsyvinski, 2021; Nakagawa and Sakemoto, 2021). For that reason, we 
next expand in other MKR and DAI related factors that are non-financial in nature to further establish 
that that centralized governance exists in the Maker protocol. 

4.2.2 Transaction and exchange factors  

Centralized governance should exhibit should manifest also in the activities of MKR and DAI traders. 
These  activities  are  captured  by  transaction  factors,  such  as  the  average  balance  of  the  addresses, 
average  transaction  size,  the  number  of  transactions,  transaction  volume,  the  number  of  large 
transactions,  and  large  transaction  volume.  As  we  did  with  the  financial  factors,  we  present  the 
univariate regression findings for these transaction indicators in the following table. 

[Table 11]  

The  regression  findings  are  again  showing  the  significant  effects  of  centralized  governance  in  the 
trader  activities  across  MKR  and  DAI  investors.  For  example,  we  observe  that 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠  has  a 
significant positive effect on the average transaction size (both in MKR and USD), volume of large 
transactions  and  the  number  of  transactions  in  MKR.  𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  can  lead  to  a  higher  number  of 
transactions,  but 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 will lower  both the  number  and  volume  of  transactions. 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 and 

11 

 
 
 
 
𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑊𝑖𝑛 exhibit a negative effect on the average transaction size (in USD), while 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 
can increase the average transaction size (in USD). A higher 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖 leads to an increase of the average 
balance  of  addresses  (in  USD).    Finally,  the  speed  of  voters  has  a  positive  effect  on  the  average 
transaction value, while the order of voting appears to decrease the volume and number of transactions. 
In  the  case  of  DAI,  the  results  are  similar  for  the  case  of 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠  and 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠 .  The  daily  gini 
coefficient  and  the  order  of  voting  does  not  seem  to  play  a  role.  However, 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑  appears  to  be  a 
prominent measure of centralized governance to affect positively all transaction factors in DAI. Unlike 
MKR,  in  DAI  the 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 and 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑊𝑖𝑛 can  decrease  the  average  balance  of  DAI 
addresses.  The  main  message  of  these  findings  is  that  there  is  substantial  evidence  of  centralized 
governance effects in multi-faceted aspects of trading activities and balances of MKR and DAI traders. 
Conceptually, it appears that more voters and total votes infuse transaction numbers and volume. The 
prominent significance of 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 is an example of how increased voting efficiency can pool together 
investors willing to execute more transactions, especially transactions with a larger size. 

Given that we established the significant effects of centralized measures in the transaction factors in 
the previous section, it is essential to examine whether similar effects are established also in exchange-
related  factors  of  MKR  and  DAI.  These  factors  capture  the  interflows  between  token  holders  and 
exchanges and can illustrate the token holder’s behavior when the Maker protocol is more centralized. 
These exchange factors include deposit and withdrawal amounts in MKR and DAI wallets across all 
supported exchanges, net increases/decreases in exchanges’ holdings over time and respective inflow 
and outflow number of transactions. As in previous sections, univariate regressions are presented in the 
following table. 

[Table 12] 

The results of the table bring forward the importance of centralized governance in the exchange factors, 
especially for the case of MKR. In MKR, 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 and 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠 can lead to more inflow and outflow 
transactions, while the outflow volume and total flow are also positively affected by those measures. 
However, the effect is negative when it comes to net flow (in MKR and USD). 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 appears to pose 
significant negative effect when it comes to volume of inflow and outflow. Conceptually, the interlinks 
between Maker protocol and exchanges will be more active when there are more voters and total votes, 
and finally the net flow will be lower. Interestingly, total flow will also be lower when the largest voters 
choose  to  express  their  choice  later. A  lower  total  flow  implies  that  there  are  less  transactions  on 
exchanges. In other words, more MKR will be held in users’ accounts. This is reasonable, as more voters 
and total votes can lead to more withdrawn MKR. Here it should be noted that MKR is the governance 
token, which means that voters will have to exchange MKR if they need to participate in polls. Similarly, 
the demand for MKR is expected to be higher if total votes are larger. For the case of DAI, the stablecoin 
of MakerDAO, the effects are not as significant, except for the case of speed of voting that appears to 
have a significant effect in the number of outflow transactions and a negative effect for netflow (in DAI 
and USD). The difference in the centralized effects between MKR and DAI could be attributed to the 
fact that exchange factors might be driven more from inflows and outflows of MKR tokens used for 
voting in on-chain governance. However, the findings still promote the key message of this study. That 
voting power is centralized and it affects the decentralization value proposition of the Maker protocol. 

4.2.3 Network and Twitter sentiment factors 

Finally, we focus on factors capturing network characteristics and social media sentiment. Firstly, as 
decentralized governance is the main selling point of Maker protocol, network statistics, such as total 
addresses,  new  addresses,  active  addresses,  and  their  active  ratio,  may  be  differentially  affected  by 
centralized governance measurements. This is examined by the univariate regressions presented in the 
following table. 

12 

 
 
[Table 13] 
The  picture  here  is  quite  robust.  It  is  clear  that  centralized  voting  is  affecting  the  MKR  and  DAI 
network factors consistently. For MKR, 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠, and 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑  exhibit significant positive 
effects on the total addresses with MKR balance, while 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒, 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑊𝑖𝑛, 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖, and 
𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 have the opposite effect. Increases in 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 and 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠 can bring more new addresses 
and active addresses. 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 can also increase the number of active addresses, while 𝑂𝑟𝑑𝑒𝑟 leads to 
less active addresses. Similar findings are observed for the case of DAI except for the gini coefficient 
and the order of voting. Overall, the results suggest that more users hold MKR and DAI once more 
voters and votes are identified. Holding MKR and DAI means lower polling participation, which means 
that centralized voting power is found to significantly drive away users of Maker protocol. This is a 
strong signal of centralization in the DeFi platform. 

In terms of social media sentiment, we focus on Twitter. Currently, Twitter is the main social media 
platform, where DeFi investors express their opinions. The community can discuss and communicate 
with each other, while the Maker protocol also has official accounts on Twitter. Focusing on Twitter 
sentiment factors, we are able to investigate if centralization in governance affects the sentiment tone 
of users. These results are presented in the following table. 

[Table 14] 
As in previous factors, significant effects are identified for both cases. For MKR, 𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 and 
𝐿𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑊𝑖𝑛  have  a  negative  effect  towards  neutral  tweets,  suggesting  that  large  voting 
concentration  discourages  neutral  sentiment,  which  would  be  the  default  position  for  a  truly 
decentralized platform. Voting speed appears to increase the number of positive and neutral speed in 
MKR. For DAI, 𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠, 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑠, and 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑 can increase the number of positive tweets.  Large 
voting concentration surprisingly does not appear to provide any kind of sentiment attention. Finally, 
higher 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑  leads  to  increased  sentiment  around  DAI,  which  is  found  to  be  more  significant  to 
negative tone than the other two. In other words, voting efficiency, as a form of centralized governance, 
could  lead  to  more  negative  tweets  than  neutral  or  positive  ones.  The  above  effects  of  centralized 
measures in social media sentiment are another signal that decentralization in MakerDAO is not ensured. 
Overall,  our  two-stage  analysis  is  providing  substantial  empirical  evidence  towards  centralized 
governance  in  MakerDAO,  as  several  significant  univariate  relationships  are  established  across 
different  classes  of  factors6.  However,  the  next  section  is  providing  some  further  robustness  checks 
towards that end. 

5. Robustness checks  

5.1 The case of Ethereum 

The Maker protocol is an Ethereum-based protocol. For that reason, it makes sense that for robustness 
we should investigate ETH factors in a similar set-up, as we do with MKR and DAI. For that reason, 
we  replicate  all  the  univariate  regressions  of  section  4  for  the  equivalent  ETH  indicators.  Here,  we 
present only the summary of the significant relationships identified in the following table. 

[Table 15]7 

As in the main empirical results, we observe that measurements of centralized Maker governance also 
affect  significantly  several  factors  across  all  classes.  For  example,  Voters,  TotalVotes,  and  Speed 
(LargestShare and LargestShareWin) are positively (negatively) affecting the ETH price. Order has a 
negative effect to Ether volatility. Extending to non-financial factors, such as transaction and exchange 

6 Given the extent of factors and univariate regressions examined, we also present summary of the relationships 
in Online Appendix OA.2. 
7 For the sake of space, all the regression outputs are presented in the Online Appendix OA.3. 

13 

 
 
 
 
indicators, we see that measurements of voting participation and efficiency have positive effects, but 
higher  degree  of  centralization  in  the  Maker  governance  will  negatively  affect  the  prosperity  of 
transactions.  Results  are  similar  when  it  comes  to  network  factors.  Larger  voting  participation  and 
higher efficiency can increase the number of total users and active users. More Voters can attract more 
new  users  as  well.    In  terms  of  social  media  sentiment,  LargestShare,  LargestShareWin  and  Order 
decrease  the  number  of  positive  and  negative  tweets.  Speed  shows  a  positive  effect  with  Twitter 
sentiment note, implying that higher efficiency of decision-making in DeFi can attract people’s attention.  
TotalVotes has a positive effect to the number of positive tweets. This finding could be explained by the 
potential  differences  of  preferences  among  the  DeFi  and  Ethereum  community.  For  example,  when 
DeFi  governance  appears  more  centralized,  positive  sentiment  can  be  created  because  of  potential 
improved efficiency, while negative note could also be generated due to the unilateral decision power 
potential of some large voters. Overall, the ETH analysis implies that polling activities on DeFi will 
influence Ethereum, while the relationship between governance centralization in DeFi and the Ethereum 
community might not be completely negative. Of course, the complicated interactions between DeFi 
and ETH lead to diversified discussion on social media, implying that investors might have different 
expectations and vested interests. 

5.2 Addressing endogeneity: Off-chain governance as an instrumental variable (MKR) 

The empirical results presented in section 4 could face criticism due to potential endogeneity concerns. 
To alleviate this issue, we use the instrumental variable approach and estimate two-stage least squares 
(2SLS) regressions. We construct an instrumental variable (IV) using datasets for forum signal threads, 
that  are  a  part  of  the  off-chain  governance  in  the  Maker  protocol.  Anyone  can  participate  in  the 
discussion  and  voting  in  the  threads.  That  means  that,  unlike  the  on-chain  governance  investigated 
previously, off-chain governance does not require MKR in one’s account. Even people who do not use 
blockchain  can  share  their  opinions  and  click  an  option  in  the  thread.  For  some  signal  threads,  the 
informal discussion will finally turn to MIP, where voters will choose their options.  

The results of signal threads could be thought are related with on-chain governance. On the other hand, 
as  a  non-custodial  stablecoin,  the  price  of  DAI  is  independent  of  Maker  protocol  but  depends  on 
exogenous collateral (Klages-Mundt et al., 2020). So, the direct relationship between DAI and off-chain 
governance is not well understood. Similarly, off-chain governance may not be an endogenous variable 
to other factors of Maker protocol. Theoretically, Maker governors aim for maximizing their revenue 
(Klages-Mundt and Minca, 2021). In other words, the factors, e.g., transaction factors, are outcomes of 
decisions jointly made by voters in Maker governance. For each thread, we document the first post date 
and the number of voters. In some threads, there will be several voting polls, and we will only count 
unique voters within a thread. Then, the number of off-chain voters daily can be calculated. This is a 
valid instrument for our setup as explained in the Appendix A.2. Based on the above we report the first 
and the second stage regressions in the following tables for the case of MKR8. 

[Tables 16-20] 
Before using an instrument, we first test if our instrument suffers from weak instruments concerns. 
Except  for  Column  (1)  in  Panel  B  and  Panel  C  of  Table  17,  our  instrument  can  be  used  in  2SLS 
regressions. Then, we are curious that if measurements of centralized governance are endogenous to 
factors for MKR and DAI. To test the endogeneity, we apply Durbin’s test and Wu-Hausman test. Since 
the null hypothesis is that endogeneity does not exist, usually, we do not observe endogeneity between 
our measurements and factors for MKR and DAI, meaning that the corresponding OLS regressions in 
section 4 are reliable. For results where endogeneity is observed (e.g., Column (5), Panel B of Table 
16), we compare results of 2SLS regressions and results in section 4, and the findings are consistent. 
Therefore, the measurements of centralized governance are generally not found endogenous to MKR 

8 For the sake of space, the equivalent 2SLS results for DAI are provided in the Online Appendix OA.4

and DAI factors. 

6. Conclusion 

Decentralization  is  crucial  innovation  of  blockchain,  and  the  rapid  growth  of  DeFi  relies  on 
decentralization. Complete decentralization is theoretically impossible (Abadi and Brunnermeier, 2018), 
and empirical evidence of centralization is detected in different layers of blockchain (Sai et al., 2021). 
In this paper, we focus on governance in DeFi and particularly on the Maker protocol, which is governed 
by MakerDAO. Decentralized governance is a crucial domain for DeFi, and Maker protocol is an ideal 
case  since  its  voting  history  is  transparent  and  precise  (Beck,  Müller-Bloch  and  King,  2020). 
Furthermore, in emerging DeFi ecosystem, MakerDAO is regarded as the most influential DAO.  

By examining Maker governance polls, we find that voters are centralized in a small group, and voting 
power is unequally distributed among these voters. In most voting activities, the largest voters could 
account for a significant proportion of votes. Previously, Azouvi, Maller and Meikeljohn (2018) and 
Gervais  et  al.  (2014)  argue  that  a  few  key  developers  have  unilateral  decision-making  power  in 
blockchain governance. This problem might derive from the requirement of programming skills. Our 
results expand the discussion to DeFi. Any MKR holder can easily participate in governance by clicking 
an  option  on  the  website,  which  would  indicate  that  governance  would  be  more  decentralized. 
Interestingly, our results show that governance in Maker protocol is highly centralized.   
  Measurements  of  centralized  governance  are  established  in  three  categories,  namely  voting 
participation, centralized voting power, and efficiency of decision-making process. By investigating the 
relationships  between  Maker-specific  factors,  we  find  that  larger  voting  participation  and  better 
efficiency usually have positive influence on the Maker protocol. For example, transaction volume will 
be higher, and more users will be attracted. On the other hand, the high degree of centralized governance 
will refrain the protocol growth. For example, when voting power is highly centralized, the number of 
total  users  and  new  users  will  decrease.  Therefore,  investors  may  give  up  DeFi  that  are  highly 
centralized in terms of governance. In the case of DAI, the effects of larger voting participation may 
not be ideal. For example, more voters will cause higher volatility of DAI. Given that DAI is a stablecoin, 
high volatility reduces it reliability. Ethereum shows interlinks with centralized governance in DeFi as 
well. This is interesting as most mainstream DeFi protocols are based on Ethereum blockchain. For 
example, larger voting participation has positive effects on ETH price. This is another contribution, as 
most previous studies focus on the interlinks in DeFi (Tolmach et al., 2021; von Wachter, Jensen and 
Ross, 2021) or the token systems on Ethereum (Fröwis, Fuchs and Böhme, 2019; Chen et al., 2020), 
while  our  findings  suggest  that  DeFi  can  influence  its  underlying  blockchain.  Currently,  the  best 
governance structure for stablecoins is an open question. If governance is extremely centralized, several 
agents can easily manipulate the stablecoin systems (Klages-Muldt et al., 2020). This paper implies that 
centralized  governance  to  some  extent  may  contribute  to  the  stability  of  stablecoins.  Overall,  DeFi 
protocol  benefits  from  decentralization  and  efficiency,  and  the  findings  are  consistent  with  the 
arguments of Abadi and Brunnermeier (2018) and Hsieh, Vergne and Wang (2017). With our findings, 
we make a compelling case in favor of the argument that decentralization in DeFi platforms is an illusion 
and that the trade-off between efficiency and decentralization is the rather true value proposition offered 
to investors in DeFi applications. 

However, our findings appear conceptually and empirically robust, they should be interpreted with 
their  limitations  in  mind.  First,  the  identity  of  dominant  voters  is  unknown. Anonymity  is  another 
character  of  blockchain  and  DeFi,  and  we  may  not  know  voters’  identity  until  they  are  willing  to 
announce (Qin et al., 2021). Second, we do not illustrate the accumulation of significant voting power. 
After checking these dominant voters’ transaction history, we find that most of them do not have many 
transactions of MKR. Few of them have transactions of other cryptocurrencies. In blockchain, any agent 

15 

 
 
 
 
can  have  endless  addresses,  i.e.,  accounts.  Therefore,  these  voters  may  have  specific  accounts  for 
participating in Maker governance. Finally, we do not know whether the authors of MIPs are dominant 
voters. If a dominant voter proposes changes to the Maker protocol, the aim of such MIPs might be tied 
to the own vested interests. With their large voting power, this could lead to further centralization of 
power  and  potential  collusion  during  the  development  of  Maker  protocol.  Currently,  writing  MIPs 
requires both programming skills and understanding of technical structure of DeFi. Assuming that not 
many voters have such competence, at least key developers can guide voters by proposing specific MIPs, 
implying the centralized power of core developers exists in DeFi. For this, the developers should explain 
their  proposals  with  more  details,  and  the  aims  of  codes,  along  with  possible  outcomes,  should  be 
described in a more understandable way. Besides, though there is no clear solution now, for better public 
inspection,  Maker  protocol  could  provide  the  MIP  authors’  addresses,  thereby  users  will  be  able  to 
detect suspicious activities of developers.

Appendix 

A.1 Description of utilized factors 

The following tables summarize the factors used in our univariate regressions. 

[Tables A.1 – A.5] 

A.2 Off-chain governance as an instrumental variable 

Table  A.6  presents  the  correlation  between  off-chain  voters  and  measurements  of  centralized 

governance in Maker protocol and the respective descriptive statistics.

Figures 
Figure 1. Governance in Maker Protocol 

Note:  Panel A  shows  the  governance  structure  of  Maker  Protocol.  It  is  divided  into  two parts,  the  on-chain governance  and off-chain 
governance. Panel B illustrates the voting process of Maker governance polls. MKR holders can participate in polls as voters, or they can 
choose delegates as their representatives.  

Figure 2. The number of polls and voters in Maker governance (Aug 5, 2019 – Oct 22, 2021) 

Note: This figure presents daily number of polls and voters in Maker governance. Panel A shows the daily number of Maker 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
governance polls, while Panel B presents the number of voters daily in Maker governance polls. 

Figure 3. Total votes, votes of the largest voter and votes of the known voters in Maker governance polls 
(Poll #16 – Poll #663) 

Note: Panel A presents total votes and votes of largest voters in Maker governance polls (Poll #16 – Poll #663). In most polls, 
the largest voter can take account for a significant proportion of voting power. Panel B shows the votes from the known voters 
in Maker governance polls (Poll #16 – Poll #663). The known voters include voting delegates and a16z and show strong voting 
power after Poll #600.

Figure 4. Gini coefficient 

Note: This figure shows gini coefficient in Maker governance. Panel A reports gini coefficient at the poll level (Poll #16 – Poll 
#663). Panel B reports gini coefficient daily in Maker governance polls (Aug 5, 2019 – Oct 22, 2021).

Type of votes 
Forum signal threads 

Governance polls 

Executive votes 

Functions 
(1) Determine consensus that something needs to be done in response to a perceived issue, 
(2) determine consensus for a concrete action to be taken in response to a perceived issue. 
(1)Determine  governance  and  DAO  processes  outside  the  technical  layer  of  the  Maker 
Protocol,  (2)  form  consensus  on  important  community  goals  and  targets,  (3)  measure 
sentiment on potential Executive Vote proposals, (4) ratify governance proposals originating 
from  the  MakerDAO  forum  signal  threads,  (5)  determine  which  values  certain  system 
parameters should be set to before those values are then confirmed in an executive vote, (6) 
ratify risk parameters for new collateral types as presented by Risk Teams. 
(1)  Add  or  remove  collateral  types,  add  or  remove  Vault  types,  adjust  global  system 
parameters, adjust Vault-specific parameters, (2) replace modular smart contracts. 

Note: This table describes three types of votes in Maker protocol. Forum signal threads are a part of off-chain governance, and 
all community can participate in the discussion on the Maker forum. Governance polls and executive votes are on-chain.

Note: This table reports the descriptive statistics of voters of Maker governance polls. For each voter, we calculate the number of polls that 
they participate in, their total votes, and the highest votes in a single poll. Here, votes are calculated in Maker (MKR), which is the governance 
token of the Maker Protocol. Besides, the first poll that a voter participated in is presented. A lower number means that the voter started to 
participate in Maker governance polls earlier.

Note: This table reports the ten voters that have the largest single votes in Maker governance polls. For each voter, the number of involved 
polls, total votes, and the highest votes in a single poll are presented. Votes are calculated in MKR tokens. The table highlights the first poll 
that a voter participated in, and the corresponding date is shown in the column ‘Since’.

Note: This table reports gini coefficient in Maker governance polls. In the first column, we calculate the gini coefficient for 
each poll. In the second column, we first integrate a voter’s votes within a day, then we compute the daily gini coefficient via 
a maximum likelihood estimation.

Note:  This  table  reports  measurement  of  governance  centralization  in  Maker  governance  polls.  We  first  calculate  these 
measurements for each poll. Then, we sum up to the get the number of voters, total votes and votes from the largest voters 
daily. The other four measurements are the average of the values in polls that start on the same day. For example, the column 
LargestShare equals to the average share of the largest voter in polls started on the same day.
