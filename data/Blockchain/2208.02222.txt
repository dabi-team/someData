  ABSTRACT  

  Hypoglycemia is an unpleasant phenomenon caused by low blood glucose. 
The  disease  can  lead  a  person  to  death  or  a  high  level  of  body  damage.  
To  avoid  significant  damage,  patients  need  sugar.  The  research  aims  at 
implementing  an  automatic  system  to  detect  hypoglycemia  and  perform 
automatic  sugar  injections  to  save  a  life.  Receiving  the  benefits  of  the 
internet of things (IoT), the sensor’s data was transferred using the hypertext 
transfer  protocol  (HTTP)  protocol.  To  ensure  the  safety  of  health-related 
data,  blockchain 
technology  was  utilized.  The  glucose  sensor  and 
smartwatch  data  were  processed  via  Fog  and  sent  to  the  cloud.  A  Random 
Forest algorithm was proposed and utilized to decide hypoglycemic events. 
When the hypoglycemic event was detected, the system sent a notification to 
the mobile application and auto-injection device to push the condensed sugar 
into the victim’s body. XGBoost, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector 
machine  (SVM),  and  decision  tree  were  implemented  to  compare  the 
proposed  model's  performance.  The  random  forest  performed  0.942  testing 
accuracy,  better  than  other  models  in  detecting  hypoglycemic  events.  The 
system’s  performance  was  measured  in  several  conditions,  and  satisfactory 
results  were  achieved.  The  system  can  benefit  hypoglycemia  patients  to 
survive this disease.

INTRODUCTION  

Hypoglycemia  is  a  condition  that  shows  symptoms  of  sweating,  heart  rate  fluctuations,  shaking, 
dizziness, and so on when blood glucose level goes under 70 mg/dl. The worst scenario can be seen when a 
patient  gets  senseless  and  sometimes  dies  [1].  This  condition  is  often  observed  in  diabetic  patients  who 
depend on insulin. So, when the patients get a hypoglycemic attack, they cannot get any kind of hint. They only 
realize when they feel weak or have any hypoglycemic symptoms, but they can't be sure without measuring the 
hypoglycemia. Here a third party is needed to measure the blood glucose level and give the patient some sugar 
[2]. In recent years, machine learning and IoT-based technologies have shown promising results in health [3]-
[5], agriculture [6], [7], and other sectors [8] in making automated decisions and treatments. 

IoT advanced technologies enable us to measure blood glucose levels and send those data over the 
network  through  the  applications.  A-state-of-art  is  that  different  auto  injections  have  been  devised  to 
complete  the  insertion  process  automatically  [9].  These  auto  injections  are  connected  over  a  network  to

servers and can be instructed as needed. Again, these servers need to be protected. These servers hold health-
related data which are valuable. While health-related data is transferred from the sensor to the fog and then 
sent  to  the  cloud,  blockchain  adds  security  such  as  immutability,  traceability,  decentralization,  and 
transparency, which gains the trust of any system user. 

Previous  research  shows  that  hypoglycemia  has  a  relation  to  blood  glucose,  blood  pressure,  heart 
rate, shivering, and sweating [10].  But researchers have ignored those parameters. Some have worked with 
only  blood  glucose,  and  others  have  worked  with  blood  pressure.  Smartwatches  [11]  and  blood  glucose 
sensors [12] provide these real-time parameters data. Adding fog, real-time data transmission latency can be 
reduced  [13].  Different  machine  learning  algorithms  and  modular  approaches  have  been  utilized  to  detect 
hypoglycemic events [14]. But a complete integrated system cannot be found or has not been proposed for 
hypoglycemia detection dedicatedly. So, this research attempts to detect hypoglycemia in real-time with all 
the previously ignored parameters. After detection, the auto-injection device injects the condensed sugar [15], 
[16] to save the patient from the hypoglycemic consequences. As these are health-related confidential data, 
providing security with blockchain technology is necessary [17]. Combining these technologies in real-time 
hypoglycemia detection with the features transmitted from sensors to the cloud makes a complete system that 
gains the user’s trust and impacts the user's life. This research paves the way for an industrialized business. 

The  whole  summary  of  this  research  is  mentioned  in  the  abstract.  A  general  discussion  about  the 
topics is mentioned in the introduction. In section 2, the research gaps have been covered. In section 3, the 
proposed  system  is  discussed  briefly.  Implementation  and  results  are  explained  in  section  4.  Then  the 
research is concluded with a conclusion. 

2.  RELATED WORKS 

Plenty  of  research  focuses  on  detecting  hypoglycemic  events  using  machine  learning  and  IoT.  
Chow et al. [18] found a clear relationship between heart rate and hypoglycemia. Billard et al. [19] observed 
a relationship with the blood pressure in a hypoglycemic state. Their experiments detected hypoglycemia, but 
their system was manual for data collecting and detecting. 

Maritsch et al. [20] collected data with a smartwatch and tried to establish a relationship with heart 
rate. Heart rate data were collected with an empatica E4 smartwatch, and glucose data was collected from a 
CGM. They achieved the best performance using gradient boosting decision tree. 

Sudharsan  et  al.  [21]  researched  hypoglycemia  and  their  dataset  contained  self-monitored  glucose 
values.  Random  forest,  KNN,  SVM,  and  Naïve  Bayes  were  applied  to  locate  exceptional  accuracy.  Those 
algorithms performed like human experts and predicted hypoglycemic events correctly. 

Gia et al. [10] developed an IoT-based glucose monitoring system that uses real-time data received 
via networks. This technology effectively communicated with data and issued a push notice when abnormal 
blood  glucose  levels.  This  study  paved  the  way  for  developing  an  Internet  of  Things-based  glucose 
monitoring system with real-time data transfer and alerting capabilities. 

Ruan  et  al.  [22]  used  machine  learning  for  hypoglycemia  detection.  Medical  data  were  collected, 
and the analysis was performed using  gradient boosting. The model performed well, giving 0.96 (AUROC) 
accuracy on clinically significant hypoglycemia. 

Anawar  et  al.  [13]  found  a  solution  to  the  time  delay  issue  in  data  transportation  with  fog 
computing.  They  concluded  that  time  delay  issues  arise  when  real-time  data  is  preprocessed  and  sent  to 
devices  through  cloud  computing.  They  suggested  for  more  rapid  data  transport  infrastructure  where 
information is swiftly stored and processed closer to data sources on local fog nodes. 

Tanwar et al. [23] found blockchain technology is the most secure approach to keeping datasets safe 
in healthcare. It can alter health interactions, access to patient information, and device tracking, among other 
things. Its authentication technique confirms validity without knowing the user's identity, and only legitimate 
users can decrypt the information saved. 

Previous  research  has  ignored  several  essential  parameters  that  directly  influence  hypoglycemic 
events.  Those  drawbacks  paved  the  way  for  us  to  work  on  this  research.  In  this  study,  we  have  tried  to 
overcome previous issues by prioritizing essential parameters and boosting the accuracy of previous machine 
learning approaches in case of detecting hypoglycemia.  

3.  METHODS 
3.1.  Proposed system 

Figure 1 represents  the block diagram of the automatic  hypoglycemia detection  system  associated 
with  an  intelligent  medicine  injecting  device.  Blockchain  has  been  used  to  impart  security  to  the  user's 
confidential  health  information.  In  this  system,  the  users  will  be  notified  of  any  hypoglycemic  attack.  The

injecting  device  will  automatically  push  the  appropriate  quantity  of  medicine,  adjusted  by  the  computer-
based dosing controller using AP and ADS technology. 

Figure 1. Proposed system block diagram 

This  system  has  two  types  of  users.  One  is  the  patients  who  use  this  system,  and  another  is  the 
doctors  who  can  only  discern  patients'  data.  Users  need  to  be  registered  by  transmitting  a  request  to  the 
registration  center  (RC).  At  the  time  of  registration,  a  user  needs  to  determine  the  user  type,  and  the  RC 
procures the relevant information by assigning an id and a public key. The Id and key are forwarded to the 
administration unit (AU) for further verification. The AU scrutinizes the user's authentication by the key and 
Id whenever they desire to interact with the system. Any unauthorized interaction blocks the user from all the 
activities  of  the  system.  Whenever  any  hypoglycemic  attack  occurs  on  any  authorized  user,  the  dosing 
controller optimizes the dose of that patient using AP and ADS and injects it into the user's body. A notification 
is sent to the user to apprise them about their health condition. All the health information of a particular user is 
stored through blockchain technology. The components of the system are described in detail. 

The RC is used to register the users and computes the id and key of the users in this system. The RC 
procures information from the users and safely stores it in the database. It procures the name, date of birth, 
contact  details  (email,  phone  no,  and  address)  from  the  patient  and  procures  name,  date  of  birth,  contact 
details (email, phone no, and address), qualification, job details, and patient key and id from the doctors. It 
computes a unique id and public key for each user.  

The  IoT  sensors  and  devices  accumulate  the  patient’s  health  information.  The  patients  wear  the 
sensors  and  devices,  which  are  accumulated  health  information  from  the  patient's  body.  The  machine 
learning  model  uses  health  information  to  detect  the  hypoglycemic  attack  of  the  patients.  In  this  system, 
patients need to wear a continuous glucose monitoring sensor to accumulate the glucose data of the patient's 
blood and a smartwatch to accumulate heart-rate data, systolic blood pressure, sweating, and shivering data 
from the patient body.  

The health information unit (HIU) manages all the patient’s health information. All the health data 
accumulated from a patient's body is placed in the blockchain through this unit. The patient's health data is 
proceeded to this unit along with the public key and id of that patient. This unit verifies the authenticity of the 
patient through the id and key with the aid of the AU. If the patient is authentic, the HIU proceeds the data 
accumulated from that patient to the blockchain. To place the data on the blockchain, the unit writes a smart

contract for each transaction. If any patients or doctors desire to retrieve data from the blockchain, they must 
dispatch a request to the health information unit. The unit verifies the authenticity with the aid of the AU. If 
the  requester  acquires  permission  from  the  system,  the  HIU  writes  a  smart  contract  for  the  transaction  to 
communicate  with  the  blockchain  server.  The  requester  acquires  the  requested  data  from  the  blockchain 
through the health information unit. 

The  AU  governs  all  over  the  system  and  scrutinizes  the  user's  authentication.  At  the  time  of 
registration, this unit investigates a user based on the id and public key that the registration center forwards. 
Moreover, it scrutinizes the authenticity of a  user whenever the health information unit receives any health 
data from the patient, and any user desires to retrieve any data from the blockchain. The administration unit 
scrutinizes  the  authenticity  based  on  the  id  and  key  of  the  user.  It  writes  an  intelligent  contract  to 
communicate  with  the  policy  list  of  the  system.  Following  the  strict  policy  list,  the  administration  unit 
scrutinizes any user.  

Fog  computing  makes  the  whole  process  of  the  system  faster  and  securer.  It  processes  the  health 
data  gathered  from  the  patient's  body  using  sensors  and  devices.  The  health  data  is  moved  to  the  Fog  for 
being  processed  from  the  health  information  unit.  Fog  processed  the  data  and  forwarded  them  to  the 
blockchain  after  processing.  This  system  has  used  the  cloud  to  operate  the  machine  learning  model  of  the 
system.  After  the  machine  learning  model  execution,  the  data  the  system  receives  is  again  placed  on  the 
blockchain from the cloud server.  

The  smart contract  is the  computer program  written to  control health data  exchange in the system 
rightfully. The administration unit writes the intelligent contract to communicate with the policy list and the 
health  information  unit  to  exchange  the  health  data.  The  hash  table  place  the  computed  hashes  of  the 
transactions  prepared  to  be  placed  on  the  blockchain.  When  the  patient  and  the  miners  approve  any 
transaction, it is considered to append to the blockchain network. The approved transaction hashes are stored 
in the hash table in this system. The transaction pool is where all the transactions are gathered, prepared to add 
to the blockchain, and retrieved from the blockchain. The health data and the detection result of a patient are 
gathered here to be appended to the blockchain. The requested data of a user is gathered here to be retrieved.  

The  machine  learning  model  detects  the  hypoglycemic  attack  of  the  patients  in  this  system.  
A patient’s health data is retrieved from the blockchain in the cloud server. The trained model of the system 
is  executed  to  detect  the  hypoglycemic  attack  using  the  retrieved  data.  The  detection  result  is  sent  to  the 
mobile system application to alert the user if an attack occurs. Five machine learning algorithms have been 
implemented for this system and compare the performance based on the accuracy. The implemented machine 
learning algorithms are KNN,  gradient boosting classifier, random forest classification  algorithm, SVM for 
kernel-linear, and SVM for kernel- RBF. 

3.2.  Proposed machine learning algorithm and training 

Depending  on  the  dataset’s  structural  quality  and  the  amount  of  data,  an  algorithm  is  required  to 
perform better on an imbalanced dataset where overfitting issues can be observed. Besides, it also needs to 
handle  null  values  or  missing  values  so  that  those  values  cannot  affect  the  outcome.  Keeping  those 
requirements  in  mind,  the  random  forest  classification  algorithm  was  proposed  and  utilized  for  generating 
decisions about hypoglycemic events. The working dataset was split into test and train sets by a 20:80 ratio. 
K (K=5) fold cross-validation was addressed for splitting the dataset. Here sklearn ensembled random forest 
classifier was used. As the working dataset size  was an average one, the number of trees was taken to 100, 
where  each  tree  was  given  a  max  depth  of  4  with  42  random  states.  After  fitting  into  the  model  with 
hyperparameters tuning, it gave hypoglycemia detection decisions by averaging the tree's results. It reduced the 
number of false positives and increased the true positive results, which was the primary aim of this research.  

3.3.  Data accumulation and processing 

Data were collected from several diabetic patients. 16,969 data was accumulated by the sensors and 
IoT devices from 16,969 diabetic patients. It took around 28 days to measure the data  manually for 16,969 
people.  Total  of  seven  features:  glucose,  diastolic  blood  pressure,  systolic  blood  pressure,  heart  rate,  body 
temperature,  sweating,  and  shivering  data  are  collected  from  each  patient.  The  glucose  data  was  gathered 
using  a  continuous  glucose  monitoring  sensor  named  Dexcom  CGM  g6.  The  heart  rate,  diastolic  blood 
pressure, systolic blood pressure, body temperature, and sweating data  were accumulated by a smartwatch. 
The shivering data was collected manually. From these seven features, glucose, systolic blood pressure, heart 
rate,  sweating,  and  shivering,  these  five  features  are  related  to  hypoglycemic  consequences.  All  the 
accumulated data was metamorphosed into float64 data types. The invalid data was replaced and handled by 
the mean value of the parameter. 

The heart rate data was taken as a beat per second (bps) unit and metamorphosed into milliseconds 
(ms). The data processing time took around five days. After successful accumulation of data, according to the

doctor's suggestion,  hypoglycemia positive and  negative data  were classified. The  working procedure of data 
preprocessing was done in a well-suited machine learning environment, google collaborator. A computer with a 
64-bit Windows 10 operating system with an Intel Core i5 CPU was used to preprocess the data. For formalism 
and processing purposes, the python library was used. Table 1 represents a description of the sample dataset.

3.4.  Smartphone application 

A  mobile application  was implemented  for the system to  notify  users about  hypoglycemic attacks 
and medicine injections. The application can be installed by the users (patients and doctors). It instructs the 
medicine pump to inject medicine into the patient's body when a hypoglycemic attack occurs. The patients 
can  view  their  hypoglycemic  attack  histories  and  current  health  data  from  the  application.  Moreover,  the 
patient  can  view  the  quantity  of  medicine  left  in  their  medicine  pump.  It  alerts  the  patients  to  refill  the 
medicine before the last five doses. 

3.5.  Auto injection and liquid sugar 

An  automatic  injection  device  is  attached  to  the  patient's  body.  Continuous  subcutaneous  insulin 
infusion (CSII) is used as a medicine pump for this system. The pump is connected to the system application. 
When any hypoglycemic attack occurs, the system application receives a notification from the cloud server. 
The mobile application sets the basal pump rate using ADS and AP. Then the application instructs the pump 
to insert the glucose dose (0.2 ml of glucose for adults and 0.1 ml of glucose for children) into the patient's 
body.  After successfully inserting  medicine, the  pump sends a signal to the  mobile app  using Wi-Fi.  After 
getting the signal, inform the user about the hypoglycemic attack and the current health information, quantity 
of pushed medicine, and the rest of the medicine. Then, if the notified person cannot reach the patient within 
15 minutes, and after 15 minutes of the first dose of glucose, if the glucose level is still below 70mg/dl, it will 
again notify through the mobile application. The application instructs the pump to insert the glucose dose (0.2 
ml of glucose for adults and 0.1 ml of glucose for children) into the patient's body. After giving the second 
dose of glucose, the pump again sends a signal to the mobile app using Wi-Fi. After getting the signal, it will 
again  notify the user about the hypoglycemic attack and the  current health information, quantity of pushed 
medicine, and rest of the medicine. Figure 2 represents the medicine pump. 

The liquid-stable glucagon by Xeris pharmaceuticals is a pre-mixable solution so that it doesn't need 
manual mixing. The temperature will be 25 °C or 68 °F to 77 °F. The medicine’s expiry date is 24 months 
after manufacture [24]. The auto-injector will be available in two pre-measured doses: a 0.5 mg/0.1 mL dose 
for  pediatric  administration  and  a  one  mg/0.2  mL  dose  for  adolescent  and  adult  administration  [1],  [2].  The 
liquid medicine must wrap in foil paper under the container as it needs to maintain 25 °C room temperature [25].

3.6.  Blockchain implementation 

       ISSN: 2502-4752 

The  blockchain  was  used  to  place  health-related  data  securely.  The  data  accumulated  from  the 
patient's  body  using  the  sensors  and  IoT  devices  is  stored  in  the  blockchain  to  keep  it  secure  from 
unauthorized and third-party interaction. The detection result of the system's machine learning model is also 
appended to the blockchain with the approval of the miners. In this system, the patient, patient's doctor, and 
patient’s  relatives  are  considered  miners.  The  authorized  user  can  retrieve  the  health  information  or/and 
detection  results  from  the  blockchain  with  the  approval  of  miners.  Miner's  approvals  make  the  whole 
retrieving and appending procedure more secure and legitimate. In our system, when any health information 
is necessary to add to the blockchain, the miners are agreed upon to append the transaction to the blockchain 
and dispatch an agreement, including their signatures. The block’s calculated hash is stored in the hash table. 
From  the  hash  table,  the  transaction  is  assembled  to  the  transaction  pool  and  prepared  to  append  to  the 
blockchain. To more efficiently encrypt the blockchain data, the binary hash tree has been used where each 
leaf node is docketed with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is docketed with 
the cryptographic hash of its child nodes' dockets. Figure 3 represents the block structure of a block in the 
blockchain in this system. Some of the parameters are used to hash a block. The used parameters are- hash of 
the previous block, nonce, timestamp, Merkle tree, signatures of the miners, and the version of the block. In 
this research, the user id, hash, previous hash, index of the block, and root are set to 32bytes, and nonce and 
timestamp  are  set  to  4bytes  according  to  the  privacy-preserving  scheme  of  blockchain  [23].  The  Ethereum 
platform has been used to implement the blockchain network in this system. The SHA256 hash method has 
been used for hash computation that encrypts the data to a 256-bit signature.

4.  RESULT AND ANALYSIS 
4.1.  Performance comparison through machine learning 

Five  machine  learning  classification  algorithms  were  used  to  detect  hypoglycemic  events  and 
compare  accuracy  with  the  proposed  method.  The  performances  were  examined  based  on  the  training  and 
testing accuracy acquired by the implemented models. The machine learning classification algorithms were 
KNN, XGBoost, random forest, SVM (kernel-‘RBF'), SVM ( kernel-‘linear'), and decision tree. The models 
were  implemented  using  the  python  library.  Implementation  and  training  of  those  models  were  performed 
using the google Colab environment. A 64-bit Windows 10 operating system with an Intel Core i5 CPU was 
used for writing code and uploading it to Google Colab. 

Figure  4  represents  the  training  and  testing  accuracies  acquired  from  several  classification 
algorithms.  The  random  forest  (RF)  classification  algorithm  acquires  0.957  training  and  0.942  testing 
accuracy. The random forest classifier algorithm was tuned with the hyperparameters’ value of ‘bootstrap’: 
[True],  ‘max_depth’:  [3,  6,  10],  ‘max_features’:  [2,  3,  5,  7,  9],  ‘min_samples_leaf’:  [3,  4,  5,  9,  12], 
‘min_samples_split’: [8, 10, 12] and ‘n_estimators’: [100, 200, 300, 500]. The gradient boosting algorithm 
was trained with 'max_depth': [3,6,10], 'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1], 'n_estimators': [100, 500, 1000] and 
'colsample_bytree': [0.3, 0.7] hyperparameters’  value  and acquired 0.949 of training accuracy and 0.938 of 
testing accuracy. The KNN algorithm was implemented for seven different neighbors' values. For K= 9 and 
11,  the  maximum  accuracies  were  achieved.  SVM  algorithm  was  implemented  for  kernel  values  of  'linear'

and 'RBF.’ For both instances, the hyperparameters 'C' and 'gamma' were set to 1.0. For SVM kernel='RBF,' 
the acquired accuracy was 0.945 for training and 0.932 for testing. And for the kernel= 'linear' acquired 0.733 
of  accuracy  for  training  and  0.721  for  testing.  The  decision  tree  (DT)  algorithm  was  implemented  and 
obtained 0.948 training accuracy and 0.935 testing accuracy.  

Figure 4. The accuracy comparison 

Comparing the acquired accuracy of the implemented model, we found that the random forest (RF) 
algorithm  provided  supreme  training  accuracy.  It  performed  excellently  based  on  training  and  testing 
accuracy.  The  gradient  boosting  algorithm  also  imparted  better  accuracies  close  to  RF,  and  the  XGBoost 
occupied  the  second  leading  position.  The  DT  algorithms  occupied  the  third  position.  It  acquired  better 
testing  accuracy  than  KNN,  SVM-RBF,  and  SVM-linear.  With  0.948  of  training  and  0.933  of  testing 
accuracy,  KNN  (k=11)  algorithm  occupied  the  fourth  position.  The  SVM-RBF  classification  algorithm 
occupied the fifth position. The SVM (kernel-‘linear’) algorithm achieved the lattermost position.  

Figure 5 illustrates  the ROC  curve  of the  implemented  machine learning  models. The  ROC curve 
demonstrates the performance of a particular  model. It is a  false positive rate  vs. a true  positive rate  curve 
illustrating the performance of a model according to the actual positive and false-positive rates for multiple 
threshold  values.  The  higher  the  ROC  curve  is,  the  better  the  model  performs.  The  ROC  curve  of  the  RF 
model  is  higher  than  the  other  models.  Hence  the  RF  performance  is  more  standard  and  satisfactory  than 
other models.

5.  CONCLUSION 

       ISSN: 2502-4752 

Hypoglycemia  is  dangerous  that  can  lead  a  person  to  death  without  providing  any  noticeable 
symptoms. In this research, we  have tried to offer an automatic device to care for a person infected by the 
disease.  A  successful  data  transfer  from  the  sensors  to  mobile  applications  was  done,  and  the  blockchain 
ensured  data  security.  Different  machine  learning  models  were  implemented  for  analyzing  and  detecting 
hypoglycemic  events  where  the  random  forest  algorithm  beat  the  other  four  models  in  terms  of  accuracy. 
Finding the accurate  model  for the dataset  was a  tricky task.  Adjusting auto-injection  was challenging, but 
the  device  performed  well  in  several  test  cases.  It  can  be  concluded  that  the  device  can  take  care  of  a 
hypoglycemia-infected person. We plan to improve the hypoglycemia detecting algorithm for faster and more 
accurate performance in the future.
