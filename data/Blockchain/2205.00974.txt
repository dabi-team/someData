Abstract. Blockchain ﬁnance has become a part of the world ﬁnancial
system, most typically manifested in the attention to the price of Bit-
coin. However, a great deal of work is still limited to using technical
indicators to capture Bitcoin price ﬂuctuation, with little consideration
of historical relationships and interactions between related cryptocur-
rencies. In this work, we propose a generic Cross-Cryptocurrency Rela-
tionship Mining module, named C 2RM, which can eﬀectively capture
the synchronous and asynchronous impact factors between Bitcoin and
related Altcoins. Speciﬁcally, we utilize the Dynamic Time Warping al-
gorithm to extract the lead-lag relationship, yielding Lead-lag Variance
Kernel, which will be used for aggregating the information of Altcoins
to form relational impact factors. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our C 2RM can help existing price prediction methods
achieve signiﬁcant performance improvement, suggesting the eﬀective-
ness of Cross-Cryptocurrency interactions on beneﬁtting Bitcoin price
prediction.

Introduction

Bitcoin is the ﬁrst cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology [1] and is
characterized by high price ﬂuctuation [2,3]. Since its launch in 2009, the price
of Bitcoin has been in a trend of short-term ﬂuctuation and long-term upward,
and rose to nearly $20,000 in December 2017, which consolidated its position
in the mainstream market, catching the attention of investors and governments.
Meanwhile, new progress has been made in key technologies such as distributed
storage, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts and encryption algorithms, lay-
ing the foundation for blockchain ﬁnance and promoting its integration into the
international ﬁnancial system. In such phenomenon, more and more researchers

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

P. Li et al.

are devoted to analyzing the trend of Bitcoin price, yielding Bitcoin price pre-
diction, which can help investors better deal with the changing cryptocurrency
market [4,5,6].

Due to the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, researchers consider
using transaction information such as overall trends and cyclical changes to pre-
dict cryptocurrency prices. The most common practices [7,8] are to use time
series data of Bitcoin for price prediction, which predicts future prices using his-
torical price information. Meanwhile, other work [9,10] considers incorporating
external information such as relevant policy news and Google Trends into pre-
diction models. In addition, several work [11] considers Bitcoin price prediction
as a classiﬁcation problem to reduce the task diﬃculty, i.e., transforming the re-
gression problem of predicting speciﬁc price values into a classiﬁcation problem
of predicting price ﬂuctuation. However, existing price prediction methods suf-
fer from several shortcomings and challenges. First, historical price information
is usually misleading in short-term forecasts, e.g. even a well-designed LSTM
model with minimal error may not beat the naive strategy — predicting that
the price of the next day is equal to the previous day. Second, external infor-
mation is complex, and the impact on price ﬂuctuation is diﬃcult to quantify.
Third, existing price prediction models have a poor scalability or generalization,
failing in transferring to new data or scenarios.

In blockchain ﬁnance market, the price ﬂuctuation of cryptocurrencies de-
pend not only on their historical records, but also on other economic factors
and external events [12]. In other words, the signals contained in the price ﬂuc-
tuation can reﬂect the inﬂuence of internal and external factors. The signals
are embedded in the price ﬂuctuation of each cryptocurrency, which inspires us
to use the price information of various cryptocurrencies and their interaction
relationship to predict the price of another cryptocurrency. Such practices are
already present in stock price prediction. Li et al. [13] considered that compa-
nies of diﬀerent scales have diﬀerent reaction speeds to market information, and
simulates the asynchronous lead-lag relationship between stocks to predict stock
trends. Similarly, there is also a lead-lag relationship between mainstream cryp-
tocurrencies and Altcoins [14]. Most Altcoins are modeled after Bitcoin, they
are based on the same consensus mechanism as it, and even completely copy
its code. Compared with Altcoins, mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
will be more diﬃcult to reach Nash equilibrium due to the constraints of many
parties, so the price will be reﬂected later.

In this paper, we consider improving the performance of traditional time se-
ries prediction models for Bitcoin price prediction and propose C 2RM, a generic
Cross-Cryptocurrency Relationship Mining method that can be regarded as
an auxiliary module to enhance price prediction. C 2RM can extract the syn-
chronous and asynchronous relationship between Bitcoin and related Altcoins.
Speciﬁcally, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to extract the
lead-lag relationship between Bitcoin and related Altcoins, yielding Lead-lag
Variance Kernel (LVK), which will further be used for aggregating the informa-
tion of Altcoins to form relational impact factors. The relational impact factors

will replace the original price series as the input of the downstream models. Our
proposed module allows for improving the performance of existing time series
prediction methods for Bitcoin price prediction through cross cryptocurrency
relationship extraction without adjusting them.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

• To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to utilize the price infor-
mation of various cryptocurrencies and their synchronous and asynchronous
relationship to predict the price of Bitcoin.

• We propose a generic cross-cryptocurrency relationship mining module, called
C 2RM, which allows for extracting and aggregating the synchronous and
asynchronous relationship features between Bitcoin and related Altcoins,
further improving the performance of existing time series prediction meth-
ods for Bitcoin price prediction.

• Experimental results show the eﬀectiveness of C 2RM module on improving
the performance of existing time series prediction methods for Bitcoin price
prediction. We study the advancement of Altcoins over Bitcoin in response
to external information when Nash equilibrium is reached. We also ﬁnd that
using short- and medium-term time series data (24 time series intervals)
to predict short-term time series data (3 time series intervals) can achieve
optimal investment beneﬁts.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we discuss
related work. In Sec. 3, we describe the details of how our C 2RM module works.
In Sec. 4, we introduce the dataset and experimental settings, and discuss the
experimental results. In Sec. 5, we conclude this work and present future research.

2 Related Work

Recently, the popularity of Bitcoin in the ﬁnancial market has spawned a lot
of research on blockchain cryptocurrencies, especially for Bitcoin price predic-
tion, of which the related work mainly concentrates on external factors, machine
learning methods and graph analytics.

2.1 External Factors

The earliest studies [15] of Bitcoin aimed to trace transactions to locate the cir-
culation of Bitcoin used for illegal activities such as money laundering and ex-
tortion. Ladislav [16] studied the relationship between Bitcoin and search terms
on Google Trends and Wikipedia, and conﬁrmed that the ﬂuctuation of Bitcoin
prices is almost positively correlated with the number of search terms. Bin et
al. [17] also studied the comments on Twitter and found that comments, espe-
cially positive ones, have a very large impact on the Bitcoin price. Karalevicius
et al. [18] collected and studied the database of Bitcoin-related news and blogs,
and the results show that there is an interaction between media sentiment and
Bitcoin price. Gurrib [19] used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and sentiment

4

P. Li et al.

analysis to predict the trend of Bitcoin price ﬂuctuation, and the results show
that the LDA (SVM) model that considers both news sentiment and Bitcoin
price information as input features achieves relatively good results. These stud-
ies have shown that external information is an important factor aﬀecting the
prediction of Bitcoin price.

2.2 Machine Learning Methods

For Bitcoin price prediction, early work attempted to use time series data for
trend prediction. Azari [7] used the autoregressive moving average (ARIMA)
model for Bitcoin price prediction, and proved that the traditional ARIMA per-
forms better on short-term time series data than long-term ones. Sean et al. [8]
used Bayesian optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) network to predict Bitcoin price, proving that nonlin-
ear deep learning methods outperform ARIMA. Stefano [20] proposed a Bitcoin
trend prediction method based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network
and introduced a new trading strategy, and experimental results show that the
method and its strategy can more accurately predict Bitcoin trends when com-
pared with the traditional LSTM model.

2.3 Graph Analytics

Akcora et al. [21] studied the impact of local topology on Bitcoin price ﬂuctu-
ation, and combined the “chain” of Bitcoin transaction network with statistical
models to predict Bitcoin price. Abay et al. [4] found that the graph-related
topological features show high utility in predicting Bitcoin price ﬂuctuation.
Crowcroft et al. [22] considered the concept of a trusted transaction graph and
proposed a set of features at a single-day time granularity. They applied the prin-
ciple of autoregressive distribution lags linear regression to evaluate the intensity
and duration of the changes in the features to aﬀect the exchange rate.

3 Methodology

This section outlines our data processing approach based on the DTW algorithm
for extracting information from short-term price ﬂuctuation of seven Altcoins, as
well as the overall framework for Bitcoin price prediction. Our task is to use the
historical prices of multiple Altcoins, and the ﬂuctuation diﬀerences relative to
Bitcoin within the time window, to predict the price of Bitcoin over the next few
days. To reveal information about ﬂuctuation in Altcoins prices, we propose two
methods for computing time series, in a synchronous and asynchronous manner,
respectively. Both methods are based on the DTW algorithm, and Figure 1
illustrates the synchronous method used to adjust the input sequence weights
and Figure 2 explains the method of extracting asynchronous information and
aggregating the input sequences.

3.1 Data Preprocessing

Normalization The prices of these Altcoins diﬀer by orders of magnitude from
each other, according to the market’s assessment of their value. In order to
preserve their absolute impact on Bitcoin, instead of normalizing the prices of
these Altcoins individually, we perform min-max normalization on them. We
observe that the lower the price base, the greater the relative ﬂuctuation, so
lower-priced Altcoins will gain a greater DTW distance from Bitcoin over the
entire time span.

Time Series Segmentation Let A = {a1, a2, · · · , am} represent the set of
Altcoins considered in this paper, and b represent the Bitcoin. We represent the
normalized prices of Altcoin a at timestep ti as pa
i . In this paper, we make one
timestep equal to 4 hours, and take the price sequences of the past 24 timesteps
(96 hours) as input, and the future 3 timesteps as the label to be predicted. For
an input time window Tw = [t1, t2, · · · , t24], the price sequences of Altcoin a and
Bitcoin b can be represented as

Pb

Tw

24],
24].

(1)

The input time window size (here 24 timesteps) and the output time window
size (here 3 timesteps) are a pair of hyperparameters that can be tuned. The
input time window is slid by 24 timesteps each time, that is, the input data will
not be repeated. Using more timesteps in input time window can generate LVKs
with more elements, which can characterize more complex interaction relation-
ships. Using more timesteps in output time window means a more diﬃcult price
prediction task.

3.2 Lead-lag Variance Kernel

DTW Distance Measure DTW is a method for determining the similarity of
two time series that vary in diﬀerent speed. For two price curves, similar ﬂuctu-
ation results in a shorter DTW distance, even if there is a time shift between the
two curves. The DTW algorithm ﬁrst calculates the Euclidean distance between
arbitrary two timesteps on two sequences and forms a matrix. Then it uses a
dynamic programming algorithm to ﬁnd the shortest path from the bottom right
corner of the matrix to the top left corner, whose length is the sum of the matrix
elements it contains.

Inﬂuenced by the entire cryptocurrency market, the prices of diﬀerent curren-
cies often ﬂuctuate in concert. Our method will capture the ﬂuctuation variance
directly through DTW distance calculation.

Synchronous Method Our synchronization method start from the DTW dis-
tance calculation between Altcoins price sequence in speciﬁc time window and

Asynchronous Method Unlike the synchronous method, asynchronous method
captures the asynchronous impact of leading-lag relationship between Altcoin
and Bitcoin, yielding Lead-lag Variance Kernel (LVK). Speciﬁcally, for two in-
put price sequences of Bitcoin and one Altcoin, the input time windows are ﬁrst
divided into n subwindows which contain 24

n timesteps:

Tw = [t1

sw, t2

sw, · · · , tn

sw].

(4)

We then calculate the DTW distance between arbitrary two subwindows between
the two sequences. Due to time causality, only the earlier subwindow will aﬀect
the later ones, the ﬁnal distance of Bitcoin to a certain Altcoin form the lower
triangular matrix.

process of aggregating Altcoin information to generate asynchronous relational impact
factors.

In summary, we weight and aggregate the input price sequence with element-
wise multiplication on the synchronous method and matrix multiplication on
the asynchronous method respectively. The generated relational impact factor
sequences will be fed into downstream models for price prediction.

3.3 Deep Learning Models

As mentioned in Sec. 1, deep learning models are widely used in time-dependent
data analysis. The most popular models are RNN and its variants of LSTM
and GRU. Compared with the typical RNN, LSTM overcomes the vanishing
gradient problem[23]. GRU [24] is similar to LSTM, but it combines the forget
gate and input gate into one update gate. GRU has a less complex architecture
than LSTM so it can be trained faster than standard RNN or LSTM. It has
been used to forecast Bitcoin prices in the past, and is as eﬀective as LSTM [25],
even better [26].

Since our task is to predict sequences by sequences, a Seq2Seq model is
necessary. Since we directly take the last three 1 × 1 vectors of the hidden layer
output as the result, the losses cannot be backward propagated to each RNNcell
during the training process, which drives us to use bidirectional models, namely
BiRNN, BiLSTM and BiGRU. In the following, we denote the input at timestep
t as xt, which is actually the relational impact factor. We denote the hidden
state transmitted between cells as ht, and the output after the fully connected

4 Experiments

In this section, we ﬁrst describe the datasets, and then present the experimental
parameter settings, ﬁnally present the results and analysis.

4.1 Dataset

We collect the information of eight cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and seven other
Altcoins), namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin (LTC), EOS, IOTA, Ripple (XRP),
Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) on the blockchain from Binance 1. For each
cryptocurrency, we intercept the price from June 1, 2018 to May 1, 2020, and
use 4 hours as a timestep. Since the results of time-dependent data analysis are
strongly inﬂuenced by the size of the dataset, we divided the dataset into three
proportions, i.e. the ratio of the training set to the test set are 7 : 3, 8 : 2 and
9 : 1, respectively.

4.2 Baselines

To illustrate the eﬀectiveness of our C 2RM module, we combine it with three
RNN-based models, and compare with machine learning model and MLPs. The
parameter settings are summarized in Table 2.

GBRT The basic settings and hyperparameters of the baselines remain the same
as in our proposed approach, except for the machine learning method. GBRT is a
non-parametric statistical learning technique for regression prediction. Since [27]
argued that GBRT is no worse than DNN for time series prediction problems,
we apply it to our task as well.

RNNs We employ three of the most common time series prediction models,
namely standard RNN, LSTM and GRU, all involving a bi-directional struc-
ture. ReLU is employed as the activation function in the cells of standard RNN.
To control the variables, we use a uniform hyperparameter settings for a fair
comparison.

MLPs We ﬁrst present a SmartMLP method, in which we directly input
“Input window × Number of Coin Types” into fully connected layers and
output a vector with length equal to output window. We also take the same
input and output a scalar, and broadcast it to a vector with length equal to
output window, which is the NaiveMLP method.

4.4 Results and Analysis

This section analyses the results of our experiments, including a comparison with
baselines, a comparison of synchronous and asynchronous methods, and addi-
tional experiments to illustrate the generalization of the asynchronous method.

Enhancement for Bitcoin Price Prediction Table 3 reports the results of
performance comparison between raw methods and their enhanced version (with
C 2RM ) with diﬀerent data split schemes, from which we observe that there is
a signiﬁcant boost in prediction performance across all RNN-based methods,
suggesting the eﬀectiveness of our C 2RM module on helping existing price pre-
diction methods achieve performance improvement.

Speciﬁcally, the machine learning method (GBRT) obtains relative lower
performance rankings, indicating the limited expressiveness of the shallow fea-
tures learnt by GBRT model. The MLP-based methods signiﬁcantly outperform
GBRT in most cases, and gain 23.88% and 31.85% average relative improve-
ments, suggesting that the simple deep models and naive prediction strategies
can provide certain price prediction guidance. The RNN-based methods achieve
the best prediction performance across all baselines, indicating that such time

of 24 points.

series prediction models can eﬀectively capture the time dependence of price
ﬂuctuation. Finally, these RNN-based methods (BiRNN, BiLSTM and BiGRU)
combined with the proposed C 2RM module obtain higher prediction perfor-
mance, yielding 45.15%, 57.85% and 46.91% average relative improvements re-
spectively in terms of synchronous method, and 61.43%, 72.30% and 65.42%
average relative improvements respectively in terms of asynchronous method,
when compared with these RNN-based methods that accept raw price sequence
input. Such phenomenon demonstrates that our C 2RM module can eﬀectively
extract the impact factors of related Altcoins on Bitcoin, further helping to pre-
dict the price of Bitcoin more accurately. Furthermore, we also observe that
asynC 2RM totally beat synC 2RM, indicating that the lead-lag relationship be-
tween Altcoins and Bitcoin beneﬁts more than the synchronous relationship.

Overall Trend Prediction We further analyze the performance of diﬀerent
methods in overall trend prediction, as illustrated in Fig. 3, from which we
observe that all methods are able to predict the overall trend of Bitcoin price
while BiGRU-asynC 2RM represented by the hollow solid line performs best.
Speciﬁcally, the price curve predicted by BiGRU-asynC 2RM is closest to the
ground truth, and BiGRU-synC 2RM is the second closest. Such phenomenon
suggests that our C 2RM module can eﬀectively capture the price ﬂuctuation
and the asynchronous lead-lag relationship beneﬁts more.

Furthermore, as mentioned in Sec. 1, even for the task of predicting one point
in the future, RNNs simply repeat the last day of the input window in a highly
weighted way so that they cannot beat NAIVE methods that repeat the last
point exactly. Therefore, it makes more sense to focus on the last two points in

a three-point prediction, or the trend in a single point prediction, because the
values of the last two points are not inferred from the ﬁrst point. In the three-
point prediction framed by the dashed rectangle, our C 2RM also demonstrates
its ability to predict three-point trends while other methods fail. In this output
window, the actual price shows a trend of ﬁrst rising and then falling, which is
diﬃcult to predict. Our asynC 2RM captures such pattern while other methods
unsurprisingly employ the naive strategy of repeating the previous trend, i.e.
maintaining two consecutive up or down trends.

Impact of LVK Size We further investigate the impact of the most impor-
tant hyperparameter — the size of LVK (n × n) in the asynC 2RM method.
Speciﬁcally, we vary the number of subwindows n in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and ﬁx other
hyperparameters. We present the evaluation results in Fig. 4, from which we ob-
serve that larger LVK (with more subsections in input sequence) beneﬁts price
prediction more. But when the size arrives at a certain level, improvements be-
come slighter. We speculate that larger LVK can extract more complex and
detailed leading-lag relationship between Bitcoin and related Altcoins, yielding
more powerful generalization.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose two generic modules for Bitcoin price prediction, in-
cluding synC 2RM for extracting synchronous relationship and asynC 2RM for

fectiveness of our methods in enhancing the existing Bitcoin price prediction
methods. We believe that the Lead-lag Variance Kernel in asynC 2RM suc-
cessfully extracts the diﬀerence in short-term ﬂuctuation between the historical
prices of Altcoins and Bitcoin and the impact on future price ﬂuctuation. More-
over, we also investigate the generalization and eﬀectiveness of LVK in terms of
size variation.
