Publications’ analysis

A large number of survey papers are being published in blockchain since the ﬁrst survey appeared
in 2017. A person entering into the ﬁeld of blockchain is faced with the issue of which blockchain
surveys to read and why? Who is publishing these surveys and what is the nature of these surveys?
Which of the publishers are publishing more such surveys and what are the lengths of the published
surveys? Which kind of survey is getting more citations? Which of the authors is collaborating on such
surveys? etc. All these questions motivated us to analyze the trends in publishing blockchain surveys.
In this paper, we have performed a bibliometric analysis on 801 surveys or review papers published in
the ﬁeld of blockchain in the last approximately ﬁve years. We have analyzed the papers with respect
to the publication type, publishers and venue, references, citations, paper length, diﬀerent categories,
year, countries, authors, and their collaborations and found interesting insights. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst of its kind and hope to provide better understanding of the ﬁeld.

1. Introduction

Blockchain, ﬁrst coined in 2008 by Nakamoto [1], has
evolved as an emerging technology in the ﬁeld of com-
puter science. It is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network,
in which nodes communicate with each other in a trust-
less environment. The main structure of blockchain consists
of blocks that are made up of transactions. The blocks are
created through a process called mining in which a miner
node collects, veriﬁes, and adds new transactions into a
block. The blocks are linked together in a chain-like structure
through hashing. It has unique characteristics like making
data tamper-proof and distributed ledger with no single
point of failure. With such characteristics, it can be used
in variety of applications, ranging from data security [2],
data sharing [3, 4], communications and networking [5], and
secure authentication [6] in various domains. Blockchain is
also applied in other domains like the internet of things (IoT)
[7, 8], healthcare [9, 10], fog and cloud computing [11],
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) [12, 13] or access control [14, 15],
etc.

A survey or review paper covers the state-of-the-art re-
search techniques, challenges, opportunities, or future work
in the speciﬁc area of knowledge. It also provides taxonomy
or categorization of the literature and gives useful insights in
the form of future work and challenges faced by the research
community. To the best of our knowledge almost 9 years
after the blockchain was ﬁrst introduced, the ﬁrst survey
paper was published in 2017 and then in just about 5 years
(till September 2021) 801 survey papers were published
covering diﬀerent domain areas. This is about 14 survey
papers in every month. This is about 5 times higher than
another ﬁeld “ad-hoc networks” in which approximately 160
survey papers were published in the same period of 2017 to
2021. With this high number of surveys, a person entering

into the ﬁeld of blockchain is faced with the issue of which
blockchain surveys to read and why? Who is publishing
these surveys and what is the nature of these surveys? Which
of the publishers are publishing more such surveys and what
are the lengths of the published surveys? Which kind of
survey is getting more citations? Which of the authors is
collaborating on such surveys? etc. With all these questions
in mind, a natural inquiry and motivation into the trends of
publishing in blockchain survey emerged.

In this paper, we have tried to answer above stated ques-
tions through a bibliometric analysis. A bibliometric analysis
is a quantitative research evaluation approach that assesses
the previous relevant scientiﬁc works based on quantitative
indicators. It is performed to analyze and visualize the de-
velopment of a scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this work, we performed
bibliometric analysis on 801 surveys or review papers pub-
lished in the ﬁeld of blockchain in the last approximately ﬁve
years. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst of
its kind.

Organization of the Paper: The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. We provide a brief overview of related
work in Section 2 and then describe data collection and
preprocessing methods in Section 3. We present bibliometric
analysis in Section 4 and ﬁnally we conclude our paper in
Section 5.

2. Related Work

Firdaus et al. [16] used the term “blockchain” for collect-
ing blockchain-related articles. They extracted 1119 articles
published during the period 2013 to 2018 from the Scopus
[17] and found that (i) the future trend will be of solving
IoT security issues, (ii) blockchain will be mostly used in
healthcare, (iii) USA, China, and Germany have the most
number of publications in blockchain, (iv) Singapore and
Switzerland have fewer publications and many citations, (v)
higher research collaborations means higher the publica-
tions except for Canada, India and, Brazil (vi) the keyword

Trends in Publishing Blockchain Surveys: A Bibliometric Perspective

Müßigmann et al. [28] analyzed the articles from 2016
to January 2020 on the domain of logistics and supplychain
management (LSCM) along with blockchain technology
(BCT). The dataset was collected from 10 databases in-
cluding Scopus, Google Scholar (GS) and WoS, then ap-
plied reﬁned data collection process which made the articles
count to 613. Authors then performed statistical analysis on
the aﬃliations and collaborations between diﬀerent authors,
highlighted the keywords, and also performed a citation and
a co-citation network analysis that helped to divide the exist-
ing work into ﬁve classes as (i) theoretical sense-making of
BCT in LSCM, (ii) testing and conceptualizing blockchain
applications, (iii) digital supplychain management, (iv) tech-
nical design of BCT applications for real-world LSCM ap-
plications, and (v) framing BCT in supplychains. Moosavi
et al. [29] performed bibliometric analysis on the articles
and book chapters collected from Scopus for application of
blockchain in supplychain to ﬁnd out the important studies
that let them deﬁne the supplychain areas and additional
integrated technologies, main research groups, institutions,
and countries. Tandon et al. [30] selected 586 articles from
Scopus covering the domain of management in blockchain
and included 72 countries, 273 journals, 1016 organizations,
and 1284 authors. Their ﬁndings are based on blockchain
applications in particular managerial areas, e.g., ﬁnance
and supplychain management. In their research work, they
recognized four sub-categories of research as (i) policy and
management, (ii) enablement of blockchain in management,
(iii) multi-domain deployment, and (iv) incompetence of
bitcoin.

For blockchain in the IoT domain, Kamran et al. [31]
conducted a bibliometric study on the dataset containing 151
articles extracted from [19]. The authors analyzed the yearly
trends of publications, keyword analysis, the highest average
citations per year, and the top listed venues. Anjum et al.
[32] identiﬁed useful insights by performing a bibliometric
study on blockchain and the healthcare domain. They iden-
tiﬁed yearly trends of publications, highest publications by
authors, institutes, countries, and publishers from all over
the world where the data was collected from Scopus from
January 2020 to March 2020.

All of the above related works mainly focus on the
blockchain-based articles and do not discuss the speciﬁc
trends in publishing blockchain surveys. In this work, we
are only interested in looking into the trends in publishing
surveys and reviews papers in blockchain.

3. Data Collection and Pre-processing

Our methodology comprises of four major steps: (i)
search the keywords from the database, (ii) collect the doc-
ument, (iii) extract attributes from the preprocessed doc-
uments, and (iv) perform bibliometric analysis on the ex-
tracted attribute data. These steps are summarized in Figure
1.

To collect our dataset, we scrapped the data from Google
Scholar (GS). For this purpose, we used Google Scholar’s

Figure 1: Methodological steps

analysis showed that blockchain is used in various ﬁelds of
research. Similarly, Guo et al.

[18] has obtained 3826 articles for blockchain published
during 2013 − 2020 from Web of Science (WoS) [19], and
used CiteSpace [20] and VOSviewer [21] to extract publi-
cation trends, top-cited authors, highly cited journals, most-
cited references, authors’ network, top-productive countries
and institutions, and emerging trends of blockchain. Zeng et
al. [22] selected Ei Compendex [23] and China knowledge
infrastructure [24] for blockchain-related literature to extract
literature between January 2011 and September 2017. From
both the sources, they analyzed the most productive authors
and institutes, collaboration patterns among authors and
institutes, and the emerging topics.

Ante [25] searched the term “smart contract” from WoS
for analyzing 468 articles having 20, 188 references with
15, 714 unique papers referenced. Smart contracts (SC) are
simple programs that are stored on a blockchain and exe-
cute only when predetermined requirements are met. They
automate the execution of a contract so that all members
can instantly be sure of the outcome. This work has applied
exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis to recog-
nize six groups of research that are (i) blockchain networks
development, (ii) blockchain and smart contracts for IoT,
(iii) smart contract security, standardization, and veriﬁca-
tion, (iv) smart contracts and blockchain for the disruption
of industries, (v) challenges of smart contracts, (vi) smart
contracts and law. The work [26] claimed to be the ﬁrst
general bibliometric study of bitcoin literature that collected
1162 papers during 2012 to 2019 from WoS and have found
the leading authors, main research areas, countries with
most publications, most productive authors, research clus-
ters, and leading authors. Ante et al. in another publication
[27] analyzed 166 articles from WoS on the energy sector
with blockchain, used exploratory factor analysis to ﬁnd
six research streams that are (i) energy market reform and
change, (ii) blockchain for security and data sharing, (iii)
energy management in scalable systems and smart grids, (iv)
information sending across networks and its applications, (v)
peer-to-peer energy micro-grids and (vi) blockchain tech-
nology potential. Social network analysis is applied to these
streams to ﬁnd the relationships and dependencies among
them. The results showed that there was more than 71.6% of
variance among the above mentioned streams.

4.1. Publication Type

Publication type is used to classify the kind of paper
that is published in a venue. The classes of publication type
include journals, magazines, book chapters, conferences,
letters, etc. We have considered only conferences, journals,
and not published articles. Not published are those articles
that have not gone through the formal process of peer review
and publication and are available online on preprint servers,
arXiv, TechRxiv and ResearchGate. Yearly statistics are
shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that there is an increase
in the number of papers (survey and review) from 2017
to 2021. Usually a survey is written when a ﬁeld of study
has progressed suﬃciently. Increase in number of surveys in
blockchain means the ﬁeld is quite dynamic and growing in a
wider domain of applications. We also see from Figure 2 that
there are more number of journal papers (510) than the other
two classes, i.e., conference (242) and not published (49).
Note that the numbers in brackets are the cumulative sum of
a particular publication type over the span mentioned above.
Furthermore, the results in Figure 2 shows that number of
journal and conference papers remain almost same till 2019
and then the journal publications increased substantially as
compared with that of conference publications. The recent
trends in publishing blockchain surveys more in journals, is
generally consistent with the publishing of surveys in other
ﬁelds of computer science.

4.2. Publishers and venues

A publisher is an organization that takes responsibility
for a research paper’s availability. In computer science, there
are famous publishers like IEEE, Elsevier, ACM, etc. in
which most of the researchers submit and publish their
articles. We see that only 6.36% papers are not published
and are available online in pre-print form. The distribution of
overall published papers with diﬀerent publishers is shown
in Figure 3. It is interesting to note that the maximum number
of blockchain survey papers are published by IEEE (25.71%)
and the least by ACM (2.25%). Springer, Elsevier, MDPI, not
published (including ArXiv, TechRxiv, and ResearchGate)
have 13.10%, 12.23%, 6.61%, and 6.36% respectively. In the
“others” category, which form 33.82%, we combine all those
publishers which have less than 5 published papers.

advanced search option and queried the phrase which con-
sists of the word “𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝐴𝑁𝐷 𝑆𝑢𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑦 𝑂𝑅 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑐ℎ-
𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝐴𝑁𝐷 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑒𝑤”. The purpose of choosing GS is because
we can get a higher percentage of publications and citations
over all the ﬁelds which are far greater than Scopus and
WoS. In the ﬁeld of computer science, GS has almost all
the citations of Scopus and WoS, which makes it suitable
over other databases [33]. Moreover, GS is freely and easily
accessible. We selected those papers which are published
from January 2017 to September 2021. After applying our
query, we downloaded papers (801) and collected diﬀerent
attributes of each paper, as shown in Table 1. These at-
tributes include paper title, publisher which has accepted
the paper for publication, type of paper (conference, journal,
or not published but available on arXiv), year in which the
paper was published, count of citations a paper received
till September 2021, count of references (number of papers
cited in particular survey or review paper), all authors, their
country and institute names and, paper size (number of
pages). After cleaning the data, we only consider 801 survey
papers.

4. Bibliometric Analysis

We now explore the attributes that we have mentioned
above. For each attribute, we present the quantitative analy-
sis and draw useful insights from them.

Figure 5: Frequency distribution of number of citations

Furthermore, we have seen in the data that there are 206
out of 801 papers published by IEEE, among which 108
are conference and 98 papers are journal papers, Springer
has published 58 in conferences and 47 in journals, ACM
has also published 18 survey papers, out of which 7 are
conference and 11 are journals. Elsevier and MDPI both have
published blockchain survey papers in journals only, with the
count of 98 and 53, respectively. Statistics in terms of top
number of publications in journals for diﬀerent publishers
and their venues is given in Table 2. It is interesting to note
that the journal IEEE Access has published the most number
of surveys (57), whereas survey focused journals, ACM
Computing Surveys (CSUR) and IEEE Communications
Surveys & Tutorial (ComST) has both published 7 survey
papers.

4.3. Number of references

References are those papers that are cited in a particular
paper. Usually, the higher number of references in a survey
paper shows an exhaustive literature review. Results for the
number of references in blockchain surveys are shown in
Figure 4, where 𝑥−𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑠 represents the number of references
used i.e., the count of papers cited in a survey and 𝑦 − 𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑠
shows the frequency i.e., number of papers which have used

Figure 6: Yearly trend in low, medium, and high number of
citations

those references. From the plot in Figure 4 we see that gener-
ally there is a large number of papers with fewer references
and fewer papers with a higher number of references. The
subplot shows the cumulative distribution function(CDF) of
the data.

Interestingly, half of the papers (402 out of 801) have
references up to 52. There is only one paper [34] that
has a maximum of 464 references. Moreover, the average
reference count is approximately 71.

Figure 7: Frequency distribution of length of survey papers

4.4. Number of citations

A paper gets cited when other authors refer to it in their
papers. Results for citations are shown in Figure 5 where
𝑥 − 𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑠 shows the number of citations received by a paper
and 𝑦 − 𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑠 represents frequency of that citation. There are
240 out of 801 papers that are not cited at all by any paper.
We see a very less number of highly cited papers (shown
by red in the plot). There is only one paper [35] that has a
maximum of 1835 citations. The average number of citations
is 31.57. The area pointed by an arrow shows frequency of
citations that lies within the range of 0 to 100. The CDF
plot within Figure 5, interestingly, shows that 83.89% of the
papers have citations up to 40. We have divided the total
number of papers into three classes based on the number
of citations they received. We assume paper less cited when
they received 0 to 10 citations, medium cited when received
11 to 40 citations, and highly cited when received greater
than 40 citations. The results for these classes are shown in
Figure 6. Generally, the recent survey papers are expected
to get more citations as they contain a more recent literature
review. This fact can be seen in blockchain surveys in years
2017, 2018, and 2019 but this does not seem to be evident
in the latest years. Interestingly all of the blockchain papers
published in 2017 are got citations.

From Table 2, we see that the number of citations for
diﬀerent venues. IEEE access has the highest number of ci-
tations (4287), whereas IEEE ComST has the second highest
number of citations (1422). The citations per paper in 2 years
i.e., the total citations received by the journal divided by the
total number of publications over the span of two years is
deﬁned as the impact factor 1 of a journal. From Table 2
we see that the number of citations of blockchain surveys
per year of a journal is always quite larger than the impact
factor of that journal. For example, in IEEE access this ratio
is approximately 75 which is much larger than its current
impact factor of 3.367 2. This interesting fact can be due to
the reason that the blockchain survey papers are getting a
higher number of citations as compared to the other papers,
including technical and survey both, published in the same

venue in our period of study. We plan to study this fact more,
including more factors, in our future work.

4.5. Length of surveys

Size of a paper is deﬁned as its length in terms of number
of pages. The larger size of a survey paper shows that authors
have performed an extensive literature review. Statistical
analysis for the size of each paper published is presented in
Figure 7. Generally, papers are published in two styles, i.e.,
in a single column or double column. For these results, we
normalized the data by dividing the length of single column
papers with the factor of 2 and keeping the length of two
column papers as it is. Generally, we consider papers as
short survey papers that have size up to 6 pages. We see
in Figure 7 that a maximum of 99 papers have a size of 6
pages. Interestingly, we see in the data that there are 139
survey papers having paper sizes less than 6. The CDF plot in
Figure 7 shows that 29.71% papers have a size up to 6 pages.
Any paper having 7 ≤ number of pages ≤ 15 is considered
as medium-sized paper. We see in the data that 43.57% are
medium-sized papers. Almost 86.39% papers have a size up
to 20 pages. Moreover, the average paper size is 12 pages.

4.6. Categorization of the surveys

Blockchain has been applied in many domains due to its
vast applicability in healthcare, IoT, and smart cities, etc.
Also, there are many papers to cover diﬀerent features of
blockchain, like smart contracts (SC), blockchain security,
consensus or scalability, etc. Blockchain is also integrated

with other domains like fog/mobile/quantum/cloud (FMQC)
computing, or machine learning/artiﬁcial intelligence (AI),
etc. We have classiﬁed the surveys into two main categories,
(i) applications, (ii) features, based on their title strings. For
this purpose, we removed stop words like is, of, to, on, for,
etc. from the title strings and kept the keywords. For the sake
of simplicity, we also removed the words like blockchain,
survey, and review, from the title string just because they
were present in each title string. Further, we converted each
word of a string into lowercase and also applied stemming
(a process in natural language processing for obtaining the
stem word, also called root word). The results are shown in
Figure 8.

The results for the ﬁrst category (features) are shown in
Figure 8(a). It can be seen that IoT has the most number of
papers (130). The ﬁeld of IoT has also been applied in in-
dustries, healthcare, and supplychain domain. Most diverse
sub-domains are also found in IoT as shown in the legend
of Figure 8(a). Also, we identiﬁed that in 2017, there was
only one survey paper on using blockchain in IoT, and from
2018 to 2021, almost 160 such survey papers were published,
which comes out to be 3 papers a month. The second highest
number of survey papers are published in the healthcare
domain (79). Although blockchain is mainly used for data
integrity and security, interestingly we found that there are
more survey papers with the title of IoT security (30) than
healthcare security (7). The third most number of surveys are
found for the Supplychain (30), and there are no survey pa-
pers that cover the security aspect of supplychain. Also, there
are more survey papers on supplychain management (20)
than IoT and healthcare management with the count of 3 for
both. There are very few papers on blockchain applications
in government, economics, engineering, and education. The
term Smart X (shown in legend of Figure 8(a)) covers smart
homes, smart grids, and smart cities, and all of them count
to 20. Similarly, particular industries(shown in legend of
Figure 8(a)) include pharmaceutical, shipping, construction,
tourism, and vehicular industry.

The results for the second category (features) are shown
in Figure 8(b). In this category, we have further classiﬁed the
keywords representing components of blockchain. Compo-
nent can be consensus algorithm or scalability of blockchain,
etc. Interestingly, it can be seen that the ﬁrst, second, and
third most number the papers are on the “security/privacy”,
“scalability”, and “consensus” in blockchain, respectively.
Consensus in blockchain is a method for maintaining a
uniﬁed state of the ledger in a decentralized system. The
most diverse surveys (covering more sub-domains of a par-
ticular domain) are conducted in the ﬁeld of “Smart contracts
(SCs)”. There are less number of surveys on “bibliometrics”,
“performance” and “development platforms” which can be
considered as future work for writing surveys.

4.7. Countries, Authors, and their Collaborations
Authors belonging to diﬀerent countries collaborate with
each other in writing survey papers. In this section ﬁrst
we provide the statistics on the contributions of diﬀerent

and their collaborations.

4.7.1. Statistics on country-wise publications

The results for country-wise publications are shown in
Figure 9. Most number of papers are published by India and
China, having count of 158 and 111, respectively. On the
contrary, USA, Canada, and some of the European countries
have published much lesser papers. We can say that most
of the survey papers are published by Asian countries than
Europe or USA. We do not show the number of publications
of every country to make the diagram simple and only show
the survey counts of those countries whose count is greater
than 10. Interestingly, it can be seen from Figure 9 that most
of the countries have published less than 10 surveys. It is also

4.7.2. Authors’ Collaborations

We have identiﬁed the collaboration between diﬀerent
authors. To ﬁnd the collaboration between authors, we have

As a standard practice, all papers must have mentioned the
name of the ﬁrst author. Then, we collected the names of
other authors as well. We then combined all ﬁrst authors and
second authors into a set and gave them a unique identiﬁer.
We then found the pair wise authors’ collaboration using
their identiﬁers. The overall statistics on the number of
authors and the number of collaborations between them are
provided in Table 3. It can be seen in Table 3 that there are

authors, other authors, and number of pairs for collaboration
can also be seen from the Table 3.

To create an author collaboration network, we used
Gephi [44], which is open-source software for visualizing
diﬀerent kinds of networks. Gephi uses two separate ﬁles,
i.e., node ﬁle and link ﬁle, for generating the network. The

node ﬁle contains name of an author along with unique
identiﬁer is written. In link ﬁle, a link in the form of pair
(source, target) of authors is written. These pairs must have
those identiﬁers that are written in node ﬁle against the name
of an author. The results for the author’s collaboration are
shown in Figure 10(a). Note that node size is proportional to
the total number of papers in which the author participated
as the ﬁrst author or in any order like the second, third
author, etc. It can be seen from Figure 10(a) that most
of the authors have collaborated with each other only in
one paper, i.e., 95.18% of the total links are single paper
collaboration links (as shown in light pink color). There
are 4.34% links showing the author’s collaboration in two
papers (black color), 0.37% in three papers (green color),
0.09% links are showing collaboration in 4 papers (cyan
color) and 0.02% links are showing collaboration in 5 papers
(red color), respectively. The highlighted links between all
proportions of collaborations are shown in Figure 10(b). It
can be seen from Figure 10(b) that the author named Khaled
Salah has collaborated with diﬀerent authors multiple times.
For instance, author Khaled Salah has collaborated with: (i)
Raja Jayaraman in ﬁve survey papers, (ii) Samar Ellahham
in four survey papers, (iii) Ibrar Yaqoob and Ilhaam a. Omar
in three survey papers, (iv) Muhammad Umar in two survey
papers, (v) Muhammad Habib ur Rehman, Muhammad Al-
Breiki and Davor Sretinovic, etc. one time. Author Neeraj
Kumar has published a maximum of 7 research papers.
Overall, the author Khaled Salah contributed in 8 diﬀerent
survey papers. Similar patterns shown in Figure 10(b) can
also be found in Figure 10(a) where the authors with more
survey papers are more likely to collaborate with each other.

4.8. Domains of highly cited papers

We have reported the statistics on top 10 most cited
papers, their domain, and the number of citations received
till September 2021. The results are shown in Table 4. It can
be seen that a highly cited paper is on the topic covering the
“challenges and opportunities” of the blockchain domain. In-
terestingly, the second most number of citations are received
by a paper which was on the topic of IoT security. Also,
survey paper published in 2020 on the topic of Blockchain
security got the attention of the community and is placed on
third rank with 927 citations.

Figure 11: All key words occurred in all years (January 2017
to September 2021).

4.9. Topic Keywords

We extracted the keywords from the title string of all
papers to identify the key domains or topics. We have re-
moved all possible stop words like on, to, for, etc. to collect
possible keywords in all papers. Also, we have combined the
words which belong to the same domain, e..g, internet-of-
things and all of its variants to “IoT”. Similarly, the keywords
like patient, medical, electronic medical records are replaced
with “healthcare”. The word cloud representation is shown
in Figure 11. A word cloud is a pictorial representation of
showing the frequency of a speciﬁc word. In a word cloud,
the size of a word represents word frequency, i.e., the larger
the word font size, the higher the frequency. It can be from
Figure 11 that “IoT” is most prominent. In fact we see from
data that it occurs 164 times. Similarly, “security” occurred
104 times in the topic strings.

4.10. Domains and Institutes

We have identiﬁed those institutes which have worked in
more than one domain and published their survey papers. To
ﬁnd this pattern, we concatenated the topic keywords with
their respective institutes and counted the contribution of
an institute against each keyword. Note that we consider the
institutes of ﬁrst author only. We have seen in the data that
most of the institutes have worked in only one domain and
published only one paper in that domain. So, just to keep
the diagram simple, we selected only those institutes which
have published more than two papers. The results are shown
in Figure 12. Note that the width of the link is proportional
to the number of surveys published by an institute and the
node width is proportional to the number of papers in a
particular domain. It can be seen from Figure 12 that Beijing
University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) have
published an overall 6 survey papers, and its 3 survey papers
are published in the IoT domain. It can also be seen that most
of the institutes have written surveys in IoT domain. We see
in the data that there are 7 institutes and each of them has
published 10 survey papers. Most of the institutes are in the
Asian region and more speciﬁcally most institutes are from
China and India. There is only one institute in the USA which
have published 4 survey papers in 3 domains. Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) and the University of New
South Wales (UNSW) both have worked in the domain of the
smart grid. University of Electronic Science and Technology
of China have worked in the domain of FMQC, eVote, and
digital currency, respectively. Nirma University in India has
published survey papers in the most diverse domains by
publishing 6 survey papers each in IoT, supplychain, smart
city, industry, industrial IoT, and FMQC.

5. Conclusion

We have conducted a bibliometric analysis, processed,
and examined 801 survey papers on the topic of blockchain
from January 2017 to September 2021. We have identi-
ﬁed the publications with respect to the publication type,
publishers and venue, references, citations, paper length,
diﬀerent categories, year, countries, authors, and their col-
laborations.

We have found that there are more journal survey papers
(510) than conference (242) and not published papers (49).
IEEE has the major percentage (25.71%) of publications
among the other famous publishers like Springer, Elsevier,
MDPI, and ACM, which have the percentage of 13.10%,
12.23%, 6.61%, and 2.25%, respectively. Interestingly, there
are more IEEE conference survey papers (108) than journal
papers (98). Also, almost 55% of the survey papers published
in Springer are conference papers. Almost 61% of the papers
contain more than 40 references and 72% of the papers have
referenced the papers in the range of 10 to 100. Almost
30% of survey papers have no citations. There are 238, 349
and, 214 short sized, medium-sized and large-sized papers,
respectively. Statistics on countries show that 74 countries
have published the survey papers and 27% of the countries

Figure 12: Aﬃliation of domains and institutes

have only published one research paper. Most survey papers
are published by India (158) and China (111), both are Asian
countries and the most populated countries of the world.
We also found out that there are 2556 total authors and
almost 95.18% of the authors have only one survey paper.
Most collaborations are found to be 5 in between author
Khaled Salah and Raja Jayaraman. The most diverse and
maximum number of survey papers are published with the
topic keyword of “IoT” and “IoT security”. Also, the second
most prominent keyword was healthcare. After classifying
the domains from the topic keywords, we have found that
most of the institutes have worked only in one domain once.
A maximum of 7 institutes has published 10 survey papers.
There is only one institute in USA, University of Florida, has
published 4 survey papers.
