Abstract—The integration of air and ground smart vehicles
is becoming a new paradigm of future transportation. A decent
number of smart unmanned vehicles or UAS will be sharing the
national airspace for various purposes, such as express delivery,
surveillance, etc. However, the proliferation of UAS also brings
challenges considering the safe integration of them into the cur-
rent Air Trafﬁc Management (ATM) systems. Especially when the
current Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcasting (ADS-
B) systems do not have message authentication mechanisms, it
can not distinguish whether an authorized UAS is using the
corresponding airspace. In this paper, we aim to address these
practical challenges in two folds. We ﬁrst use blockchain to
provide a secure authentication platform for ﬂight plan approval
and sharing between the existing ATM facilities. We then use the
fountain code to encode the authentication payloads and adapt
them into the de facto communication protocol of ATM. This
maintains backward compatibility and ensures the veriﬁcation
success rate under the noisy broadcasting channel. We simulate
the realistic wireless communication scenarios and theoretically
prove that our proposed authentication framework is with low
latency and highly compatible with existing ATM communication
protocols.

I. INTRODUCTION

The emerging Unmanned Aircraft System stimulates the
development of a new paradigm of transportation, the integra-
tion of different modes of autonomous and smart vehicles to
facilitate the agile mobility of people and cargo between places
[1]–[3]. In this context, Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) aims
to develop air transportation systems that move people and
cargo between places previously not served or underserved by
aviation using revolutionary new aircraft, such as smart UAS
[4], [5]. The principal requirement for AAM is the coexist of
UAS and regular aircraft within the national airspace under
a uniﬁed and coordinated management framework [6]–[8].
However, this requirement brings challenges to the current
Air Trafﬁc Management (ATM) systems. Currently, several
obstacles impede the integration of UAS into the national
airspace, and the most difﬁcult ones are real-time veriﬁcation
and airspace usage authentication [9]–[11]. These criteria
require the UAS to broadcast its identity to ATM facilities
in a veriﬁable and trustworthy way.

In regular scenarios, each operational aircraft uses an ADS-
B transponder at 1090MHz to broadcast its ID, and other
critical ﬂight information to the ATC facilities [12], [13] while
a Remote ID Broadcast Module [14], [15] is required for UAS.
In these solutions, all communication entities within the cur-
rent solution broadcast the critical information using plain text
without cryptographic features. Consequently, ATM systems
are still vulnerable to cyber attacks. For example, a malicious
adversary can deliberately broadcast a high volume of fake
data packets to mislead and interrupt the normal operations of
ATC. In addition, the ADS-B protocol has become a de facto
standard with corresponding transponders installed on nearly
every aircraft. It is impossible to upgrade them in a short
time for secure authentication features. System upgrades in
the aviation industry need to be taken with sufﬁcient backward
compatibility.

Non-cryptographic solutions have been proposed to facili-
tate the existing ATM systems with identity veriﬁcation capa-
bility [16]–[18]. The key idea of these approaches is to derive
the protocol-agnostic physical layer features from the raw sig-
nals for pattern recognition, and transmitter identiﬁcation [19]–
[21]. However, on the one hand, the physical layer features of
raw signals can change drastically under different conditions
(e.g., interference, weather, or antenna characteristics), making
to get a widely acceptable wireless transmitter
it difﬁcult
identiﬁcation model. On the other hand, although crypto-
graphic identity veriﬁcation approaches are more reliable, the
communication channel bandwidth between UAS and ATM
facilities is limited. Therefore, special mechanisms are needed
to ensure the successful delivery of authentication information
while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing
ATM infrastructures.

In this paper, we propose a secure framework for the safe
integration of UAS into the national airspace. We ﬁrst propose
a blockchain enabled framework for the authentication of
ﬂight plans and exchanging secret keys between UAS and
ATM infrastructures. We then provide an enhanced ADS-
B protocol using fountain code [22], [23] for the reliable
transmission of authentication information in capacity-limited
wireless channels. Our contributions are as follows:

 
 
 
 
 
 
• We provide a blockchain based framework for the review
and authentication of ﬂight plans between UAS and
existing ATM infrastructure, which is reliable and robust
to single-point failure under cyber attacks.

• We provide a backward compatible and enhanced ADS-
B protocol for aviation communication. The protocol
increases the trustworthiness and reliability of commu-
nication between UAS and ATM.

• We theoretically prove that our proposed authentication
framework is highly compatible with the de facto ATM
communication protocol.
Our
research offers a solution for cyber defense in air
and ground smart vehicle networks. This solution maintains
the best backward compatibility with the existing air trafﬁc
the
management facilities and can be extended to protect
communication channel of manned aircraft. The remainder
of this paper is organized as follows: A literature review of
related works is presented in Section II. The methodology in
Section III. Performance evaluation is presented in Section IV
with conclusions in Section V.

II. RELATED WORK

A. Blockchain in Cyber Physical Systems

Blockchain is a speciﬁc kind of decentralized and dis-
tributed database that utilizes cryptography algorithms and
consensus mechanisms to prevent
information from being
modiﬁed maliciously [24], [25]. The most elegant feature of
the blockchain is information integrity, in which no one can
modify the data without controlling greater than 50% of com-
putational resources among all peers [26], [27]. Blockchain
has been adapted to many Cyber-Physical Systems for secure
data storage [28]. For example, in [29], a scalable frame-
work is proposed to manage the accessibility of computa-
tional resources using Blockchain. Their approach introduces
a Private Blockchain Network in the Cloud as well as one
Management Hub. In [30], a Blockchain-enabled hierarchical
Cloud architecture for CPS is proposed, and the Blockchain is
deployed as a secure information exchange media within the
service provider and consumers. Blockchain can also be used
as a secure middleware for network routing and authentication
[31]–[33].

B. Non-cryptographic Identity Veriﬁcation in Air Trafﬁc
Surveillance Systems

ATM systems are becoming a crucial

infrastructure for
VANETs and UAS. In this domain, the non-cryptographic
identity veriﬁcation of UAS and manned aircraft is attract-
ing attentions. Authors in [34] used the instantaneous phase
varying pattern of signals as a distinctive feature for aircraft
identiﬁcation. Phase patterns can be applied to low-cost equip-
ment, as in [35] and [36], the authors extract the phase patterns
in each ADS-B message and use a Deep Neural Network
(DNN) model to identify the genius ones. However, a common
problem of these research is that the identiﬁcation model is not
robust to the varying wireless channels and RF front-ends. This

motivates us to provide a more robust solution using proactive
ﬁngerprint embeddeding with backward compatibility.

III. METHODOLOGY

This section will provide an overview of the system model,
followed by the blockchain infrastructure and procedures for
secure authentication of UAS with the existing ATM facilities.
We will then introduce our modiﬁcation of the enhanced ADS-
B protocol for the identity veriﬁcation of UAS in real-time.

A. System Model

The system diagram of our proposed solution is in Figure 1.
As depicted, we suppose that all ATM facilities (including
ATC facilities and weather observation stations) are con-
nected as nodes in a private blockchain network. In this
ATM blockchain network, vital information such as airspace
availability, weather, ﬂight plans, etc., can be shared and stored
securely. We also deﬁne that UAS users are supposed to submit
their ﬂight plans via regular civilian communication media,
such as cellular networks. The submitted ﬂight plans are
assessed and authorized by smart contracts. Once a ﬂight plan
is approved, the en-route authentication credentials (tokens)
will be delivered to the UAS and are utilized to generate the
enhanced ADS-B packets.

Fig. 1. Blockchain authentication framework for UAS

B. Blockchain for Secure Flight Plan Assessment

We utilize blockchain and smart contracts to make ﬂight
plan assessment transparent and secure. In other words, the
malicious needs to compromise at least 51% of the nodes in
the blockchain network to malfunction the assessment process.
The procedures of ﬂight plan submission and assessment
procedure of ﬂight plans are as follows:
Step 1: UAS users submit ﬂight plans with digital signatures
to the ATC blockchain network via ground control
stations. Flight plans will be broadcast to all nodes
in the ATM blockchain network. In general, a ﬂight
plan contains waypoints, estimated times of arrival,
and the UAS registration number.

Step 2: Once a ﬂight plan is broadcast, the smart contract will
assess it with the newest regulations and information.

If the smart contract approves a ﬂight plan, an appro-
priate node in the ATM blockchain will be selected
to generate an authentication credential for this ﬂight
plan. We ﬁrst generate a list of the top ten candidates
using the metric as:

s =

1
D + L + 1

(1)

where L is the averaged latency of authentication
credentials generation within the past 24 hrs, and D
is the distance between the take-off point and the
related nodes within the air space. We then randomly
select one out of ten to generate the authentication
credential.

Step 3: The authentication credential of a ﬂight plan is com-
posed of: i) a temporal symmetric key (SKp). ii) a
hash digest for the ﬂight plan (IDf p) generated by the
smart contract. iii) a challenge string. iv) the digital
certiﬁcate of the ﬂight plan signed by the issuance
facility (IDif ). iv) The LT Code message generation
matrix MLT [37]:

MLT =



K×N

(2)

where MLT is the message generation matrix of LT
code, a practical implementation of fountain code.
The message generation matrix contains only zeros
and ones, MLT needs to have full rank. It actually
represents the Tanner Graph of the LT code encoder.
LT code is the practical implementation of fountain
code.

Step 4: The authentication credential of a ﬂight plan is ﬁrst
broadcast within the ATM blockchain network. Then
it’s encrypted by the public key (P ubKU ) of the UAS
user and sent back to the ground control station of
UAS.

Given these steps, a UAS user can verify that a trustworthy
entity formally approves the ﬂight plan. Meanwhile, a UAS
will be able to generate its authentication information during
its ﬂight. In this work, we assume that the UAS can always
maintain a reliable Internet connection in the preﬂight stage.
We believe that temporal symmetric encryption is more ap-
propriate to secure the en-route communication between UAS
and ATC facilities with low overhead.

C. Enhanced ADS-B Protocol for Reliable Broadcast Authen-
tication

ADS-B is the standard for ATC and ATM. In a Mode S
transponder with Extended Squitter, a standard data packet
contains only 112 bits and does not contain any authentica-
tion payload [12]. Therefore, some modiﬁcations are needed.
Speciﬁcally, we propose a new message category termed as
authentication message. According to the data blocks of ADS-
B message in Figure 2, we can have 51 bits available in the
periodically broadcast 1090ES squitter message. Therefore,
the size of the encoded symbols for LT code needs to be
less than 51 bits because we also need to reserve bits to
indicate how we generate the symbol. These hints are termed
as encoding hints in Figure 2. Given that
the length of
the raw authentication payload is M , we need to divide
the raw authentication message into K equal-sized symbols
(C1, · · · , CK), and the size of each symbol (LC) has to satisfy:

LC < 51 − Lh

(3)

where Lh is the size of the encoding hints. In our solution,
an encoding hint indicates the column vector in MLT that is
used to generate an encoded symbol. We also deﬁne that the
number of column in MLT needs to satisfy:

N > r0 ·

M
LC

(4)

where r0(r0 > 1) is the redundancy coefﬁcient and M is the
size of the authentication payload before encoding. It means
that during the transmission of a complete authentication
payload, every symbol is generated using a different sub graph.
To avoid reusing columns in the message generation matrix,

we have the following constraint:

51 − (cid:6)Log2

(cid:2)N (cid:3)(cid:7) ≥ LC
(5)
where (cid:6)Log2
(cid:2)N (cid:3)(cid:7) is the length of the encoding hints, M is
the size of authentication payload, LC is the size of encoded
symbols. Therefore, the conﬁguration of parameters can be
categorized into a constrained optimization problem.

Fig. 2. Data block of ADS-B message and our modiﬁcation

Fig. 3. En-route authentication

Once a UAS takes off, it is supposed to broadcast the au-
thentication payload using LT Code periodically. The authen-
tication payload contains the certiﬁcate of the current ﬂight
plan (IDf p) plus a response to the cryptographic challenge.
The authentication procedure is depicted in Figure 3, also as
follows:

Step 1: If the LT Code message generation matrix is with
K rows and N columns as in (2). The message
generation procedure resembles matrix multiplication,
but we use binary XOR to replace the binary addition
during calculation:

[E1, · · · , EN ] = [C1, · · · , CK] × MLT

(6)

Preﬂight

where C1, · · · , CK are segments of the raw mes-
sage (the authentication payload). E1, · · · , EN are
encoded authentication messages to broadcast. In the
context of fountain code, E1, · · · , EN are termed as
droplets.

Step 2: Once a ATC facility intercepts NL(M/LC) authen-
then try to decode and
it will

tication messages,
reconstruct the authentication payload:

[C1, · · · , CK] = [E1, · · · , EN ] × M −1
LT

(7)

where M −1
LT is the inverse of MLT . We can also use
Belief Propagation algorithm to reconstruct the pay-
load [37]. The reconstructed authentication payload
will be broadcast and sent to the smart contract.

Step 3: The smart contract can broadcast the authentication
result and periodically change the challenge string via
ADS-B interrogation protocol [38].

For UAS with higher computational capabilities, we can
further require the UAS to digitally sign its response to
the challenge string. In which it will be computationally
impossible to generate fake authentication credentials.

IV. EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we will discuss the attack surface of the
framework and evaluate the performance of the en-route
authentication payload encoding scheme.

A. Security Analysis

We discuss the possible attacks in two stages: preﬂight
and en-route, as in Table I. The malicious attackers need
to get access to the ATM blockchain or gain the private
keys of UAS and its owners to compromise the security
mechanism. There are many ways we can prevent malicious
attackers from accessing the ATM blockchain, such as multi-
factor authentication. Therefore, we believe this authentication
framework is sufﬁciently secure.

B. Performance Evaluation of the Encoding scheme

For ADS-B systems, the worst-case Packet Loss Rate (PLR)

with distance has been proposed in [39] as:

y = 65.366 + 0.020319 × distance[km]

(8)

Therefore, we only need to set the range of PLR from 65%
(less than 1 km) to 95% (1485 km). We initially set the size
of symbols to be 16 bits and compare the average number of
data packets needed to reconstruct the authentication payload
under different PLR is given in Figure 4. The number of
encoded packets increases with two factors: i) the size of
the raw authentication payload. ii) the packet loss rate of the

under different P LR in Figure 4. The minimal value is deﬁned
as:

r∗

N0

(9)

where NP LR is the average number of non-repeated encoded
packets needed to reconstruct the authentication payload prop-
erly. N0 is the minimal number of encoded packets needed to
reconstruct the payload where P LR = 0. As in Figure 4, r∗
0
grows exponentially with the increase of PLR and does not
seem to be affected by the size of raw payloads.

payloads with symbol size being 16 bits.

If we limit the range of UAS operation to 100 km, the
maximum PLR becomes 68%. Then we can simulate the
performance of the authentication encoding scenario. We focus

that this authentication payload encoding algorithm is fully
compatible with the de facto ADS-B protocol in air trafﬁc
control facilities.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose a secure framework for the safe
integration of UAS into the national airspace. We ﬁrst propose
a blockchain enabled framework for the authentication of ﬂight
plans and exchanging authentication secrecy between UAS
and ATM infrastructures in the preﬂight stage where reliable
Internet connection is available to the UAS. We then provide
a fountain code enhanced ADS-B protocol for the en-route
authentication of UAS, and this protocol is seamlessly com-
patible with the de facto ADS-B ecosystem for ATC and ATM.
More importantly, we theoretically prove the compatibility of
this protocol in the de facto ADS-B systems.

on the minimal redundancy and the average number of packets
we need to transmit
to deliver the authentication payload
properly. As depicted in Figure 6 and 7, large authentication
payloads require more data packets to deliver properly, but the
average transmission redundancy maintains relatively stable.
In the meantime, we can reduce the packets needed to deliver
the payload. The redundancy of transmission is relatively
stable.

C. Practical Conﬁguration and Adaptation

Suppose that we want to deploy this authentication frame-
work into the real ADS-B transponders for UAS and regular
aircraft. We can conﬁgure the size of the authentication
payload to be 1024 bits and the symbol size to be 32
bits. In this way, authentication messages can be delivered
and reconstructed within 120 ADS-B packets (less than one
minute). As in Figure 7,
the redundancy for transmission
needs to be around 3.25. Therefore, we should provide
(cid:100)log2(1024 × 3.25)/32(cid:101) = 7 bits to store the encoding hints
Lh. As we have 51 bits > 32 + 7 = 39(bits). Consequently,
the de-facto ADS-B protocol is capable of carrying on the pro-
posed authentication framework. Even if we use a 2048-bit au-
thentication payload, we only need (cid:100)log2(2048 × 3.25)/32(cid:101) =
