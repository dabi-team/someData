Abstract:  The  spirit  of  “blockchain  technology”  is  a  distributed  database  in  which  saved  data  is  transparent, 
accountable,  public, immutable,  and traceable.  This  base-level  disruptive technology  can  boost the security  and 
privacy-related  efficiency  of  various  domains.  As  Bangladesh  is  currently  aiming  for  sustainable  development, 
blockchain  technology  adoption  by  the  local  researchers  is  growing  robustly.  However,  in  Bangladesh,  the 
blockchain Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is not yet well structured which is also limiting the perspective 
of  local  developers  and  researchers.  Therefore,  sectors  like  governance,  healthcare,  security,  privacy,  farming, 
information  authentication,  cryptocurrencies,  internet  architecture,  data,  and  so  on  are  unable  to  utilize  the  full 
potential of this technology. In this research, the authors conduct an in-depth review of such types of blockchain 
technology-related research articles that have been published recently and are also solely focused on Bangladesh. 
From 5 publishers (IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, and SpringerLink) this study analyses 70 
articles published during the year 2016-2020. The study results find the top 13 sectors where Bangladeshi researchers 
are  currently  focusing  on.  Those  studies  identify  that  the  rigid  policy  by  the  government,  scarcity  of  expert 
researchers,  and  lack  of  resources  are  the  main  reasons  why  Bangladesh  is  still  struggling  to  accommodate 
blockchain  extensively.  In  addition,  published  papers  are  mostly  based  on  theoretical  concepts  without  an 
appropriate  implementation.  Finally,  this  study  will  be  a  great  resource  to  the  developers,  entrepreneurs,  and 
technology enthusiasts to determine the strategic plan for adopting blockchain technology in Bangladesh or even to 
any other developing country.

1. Introduction 

Satoshi  Nakamoto  initially  introduced  both  Blockchain  Technology  and  Bitcoin  in  2008,  where  he 
defined  how  a  cryptology-based  decentralized  and  distributed  public  ledger  can  be  accumulated  into  a 
digital  application  [1]-[2].  In  the  current  policy,  currency  dealings  between  two  persons  or  firms  are 
centralized and measured by a third-party unit such as a bank [3]. In addition, to perform that transaction, 
a fee is also charged. To solve this aforesaid issue, blockchain technology has developed. But the concept of 
blockchain technology  is not  limited  to digital  exchange  and  finance  anymore.  It  has  regularly  stretched 
into  healthcare, management  of  supply  chain, marketplace monitoring,  intelligent  energy, personal data 
privacy, and so on [4]–[7]. Different kinds of domains are going up with the importance of blockchain. As 
a  developing country, blockchain  will  have  a  significant  influence  on  it.  If  Bangladesh  is allowed  to  use 
cryptocurrency,  the  corruption  rate  will  be  decreased  dramatically  [8].  In  Bangladesh,  there  is  limited

progress  in blockchain  technology  due  to the  lack  of  structures and  directions.  The current policy  of  the 
Bangladesh  Bank,  which deliberates bitcoin and  additional cryptocurrencies to be  illegitimate  under  the 
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) of 1947 and the Money Laundering Prevention Act (MLPA) of 
2012, is the most severe question1. In some other domains like Supply Chain, Healthcare, Business, Privacy, 
IoT, Data Management Areas, Proposed National Blockchain Strategies, Blockchain technology can also be 
executed [9].  In this document, there are some approaches that the authors tried to prescribe a pathway to 
become a blockchain-enabled nation. However, to achieve that, we need a team of Blockchain Experts, some 
Technologists  who  understand  blockchain  technology,  academicians,  government  officials,  and  other 
collaborators with a better policy that supports blockchain-based technology. Our neighbour country India 
has progressed in many sectors in blockchain technology. Many countries have also accepted blockchain 
technology sectors earlier and now leading the entire world, such as China, Australia, Japan, UAE, Malta, 
Switzerland, USA, Estonia, U.K., Singapore2. 

In  this  study,  we  outline  a  systematic  literature  review  on  blockchain  technology  development, 
especially in Bangladesh. A systematic literature review defines, chooses, and objectively appraises a study 
to  answer  an  articulated  question  [10].  It  is  essential  to  give  a  country  the  direction  towards  future 
researches, broadens the knowledge on the research topics, and also to detect which domains of research 
are inescapable that need to perform. Health systematic literature review [11], procedures for performing 
systematic reviews [12], software engineering [13], cloud computing service composition [14], microcredit 
industry [15], enhancing security through software-defined networking-IoT enabled architecture [16], are 
some good examples of systematic literature reviews that previously helped us while adopting with those 
sectors. 

The main theme of this paper is based on the collection of some Statistical Data and Analysis Results 
which are mainly being focused on adopting blockchain technology within Bangladesh. We have collected 
data from five publishers like IEEE Xplore, ACM, Springer, Taylor & Francis, and ScienceDirect. We also 
have devised Blockchain-related journals and their distribution by discipline. Consequently, a total of 70 
journal papers could be possible to find out by us that have prescribed mainly based on Bangladesh. To the 
best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review would be the first where a detailed analysis is done 
exclusively on the blockchain-related articles formed in Bangladesh. 

1.1. Key Research Contributions 

•  To find out the progress of blockchain technology in Bangladesh. 
•  To ponder about the policy on blockchain technology in Bangladesh, policy-makers, educational 

institutions, and responsible technical persons. 

•  To unleash possible technical sectors of Bangladesh where we can use blockchain technology. 
•  Expressing all the barriers in Bangladeshi society during the adoption of blockchain technology. 
• 

Searching those types of people who are working on executing blockchain technology in 
Bangladesh precisely. 

•  Finding out the papers and the domains that are being practiced on Blockchain Technology in 

Bangladesh. 

2. Proposed Method 

A detailed description of the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of blockchain technology adoption in 
Bangladesh  has  illustrated  in  this  section.  An  SLR  is  a  formal  procedure  where  researchers  design  and 
develop  the  research  questions based  on  evidence  [17]. This  section provides  insight  on  how blockchain 
technology is being evolved here in Bangladesh with adequate scientific evidence. It also delivers detailed 
information  on  the  ongoing  research  domains,  challenges,  and  a  preamble  place  for  future  blockchain 
technology-related  research  scope  in  Bangladesh.  Overall,  the  study  critically  examined  blockchain 
technology-related  research  articles.  The  detailed  SLR  procedure  has  been  adopted  to  Kitchenham’s

procedure  that  includes  sections  like  research  questions,  article  selections,  manual  selections,  attributes 
framework, and articles assessment (Figure-1) [18]–[20].  Besides, this article also accommodates guidance 
to make systematic literature from another study as well [21]. 

Figure 1.  Overview of the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Protocol. 

Initially, this section provided a brief idea about the specified four sections demonstrated in Figure-1: 
a) Overview: In the overview part, this study searches for the precised research directions and motives. 
Once the direction and motive selection is done, the study does decide to focus on the SLR of the blockchain 
technology adoption in Bangladesh. Finally, in this section, research questions based on the selected topics 
are done. 

b) Article Selection: After a thorough analysis of the research questions, the study covers the initial 
searches  for  all  the  Blockchain  Technology-related  papers  which  address  Bangladesh  (adopted  by  the 
Bangladeshi authors or published in the Bangladeshi venues as well). Once the initial article selection has 
been done, a manual selection for inclusion and exclusion of articles has been completed to choose the final 
set of articles for further study. 

c) Attribute framework: The attribute identification from the finally selected articles is evaluated by 
the pilot experiment. By performing this pilot experiment, this study has outlined the justified attributes. 
Finally, the framework tries to finalize the attribute and creates a database from the selective digital libraries 
for articles. 

d) Article assessment: Article assessment is the final part of the SLR protocol. This part tries to finalize 
the pilot assignment by writing the query based on those selected databases. After writing all the queries, 
the  study  categorizes  and  examines  each  article  manually  to  identify  the  domain.  Then  the  research 
questions have been explained by this work exponentially and the work also has been summarized to reach 
our goal consecutively. 

2.1. Goal and Research Questions 

It  has  almost  been  a  decade  since  Nakamoto  introduced  blockchain  technology  [22].  Afterward, 
countries  all  over  the  world  are  adopting  this  ground-breaking  technology  for  multiple  purposes. 
Depending  on  the  applications,  technological  strengths,  and  research  implications,  every  country  has 
managed blockchain differently. Similarly, being a developing country, Bangladesh has also accommodated

this blockchain technology with enormous opportunities for scientific and technological growth. Therefore, 
this  study  critically  analyses  Bangladesh-related  blockchain  technology  articles  to  provide  a  concrete 
research direction and upcoming adoption challenges aiming especially all the policymakers, researchers, 
and government. For this, this study formulates three research questions (Table-1).

 RQ1  What  are  the  application  divisions  in  which  blockchain  adoptions  are 

being utilized or developed in Bangladesh? 

RQ2  What are the impediments and encounters of blockchain technology 

RQ3 

adoption in Bangladesh? 
How Policymakers  should approach to  adopt the blockchain technology 
for sustainable development in Bangladesh? 

2.2. Article Selection 

In  this  article  selection  section,  this  study  finalizes  the  articles  taken  into  consideration  for  this 
systematic  literature  review  (SLR).  Five major millstones  are  shown  in the  review protocol  (Figure-1) to 
complete  this  whole  article  selection  procedure.  In  addition,  this  study  also  searches  for  some  relevant 
publication  venues  followed  by  the  identification  of  duplicate  articles.  Search  results  from  several 
publishers were analysed based on their titles. Besides, a summary of the chosen articles was also created 
for future use through this study. Based on that initial article selection, this study focuses on the authors' 
nationality.  Then,  the  articles  are  excluded  or  included  after  checking  references  before  finalizing  the 
ultimate article selection. 

2.3. Inclusion Criteria (IC) 

All  the research  questions  and the  domain  of  those researches that have been created based  on  the 
blockchain technology adoption in Bangladesh are mainly focused on this Inclusion Criteria. By following 
these inclusion criteria (IC), this study identifies the article selection condition that allows us to identify the 
research directions and challenges of blockchain use-case. (Table-2) illustrates the IC of this SLR.

The  selected  papers  must  have  strong  relevance  with  blockchain  technology  which  is  adopted  in 
Bangladesh, it should be verified from the title, abstract, and keywords from the article selection. 
Those articles that are already published in journals and conferences in Bangladesh should be 
selected for review. 
Those published articles written by Bangladeshi authors and those should be written in English. 
Should have collected the articles that have been published “between” 2016 to 2020. 
The selected papers must be blockchain technology-related but they can be accepted from various 
domains. 
Manual analysis is imperative for picking up the conceivable significant papers accurately concerning 
this subject with the assistance of title, keywords, and abstract. 

2.4. Publishers’ Library Selection 

This study uses five libraries for searching the relevant research topics. From these publishers’ libraries, 
this work selects some chapters of books, journal articles, conference articles that are relevant to the study 
topics  which  are  involved  in  a  systematic  literature  review  of  blockchain  technology  adoption  in 
Bangladesh.  By  using  the  search  options  of  each  publication  library,  this  study  critically  scrutinizes  to 
include the articles related to our study objective. To be more specific, the searching factors are confined to 
Title, Abstract, and keywords. All the five publishers’ libraries are listed in (Table-3).

4.1. RQ1: What are the application divisions in which blockchain adoptions are being utilized or 
developed in Bangladesh? 

Based  on  our  analysed  literature,  this  study  outlined 13  application  sub-domains  where blockchain 
technology is being used. From 4.1.1 to 4.1.13, this study will describe those sub-domains extensively and 
also justifies them with respect to Bangladesh. 

4.1.1. Governance 

Almost one-fourth (23) of the total articles considered (70) in this study are governance-related (Table-

11). These articles include supply chain, e-voting, land registration, management system.  

This article is about Driving License Supervision and Driver’s Repute System for our country [23]. In 
that article the author tried to make a highlight on blockchain and smart contracts that created an improved 
driving license administration, driver’s reputation framework, and computerized a few repetitive steps for 
a proficient system. 

Another article  is  about  E-voting by  using blockchain technology  [33].  In that  kind  of  article  an  IoT 
based framework is planned to exchange information from e-voting gadgets to the nodes and the approach 
uses a conveyed ledger technology where information is shared and conveyed into a network. 

Bangladesh is a country where corruption and mismanagement are major issues against development. 
Every year corruption and bad governance cost lots of money in Bangladesh3 . If more research and a real 
implementation  of  blockchain  technology  can  be  done  in  Bangladesh,  the  country  will  be  able  to  save 
millions.   

4.1.2. Healthcare 

   From (70) articles there are only (6) articles regarding healthcare (Table-11). These articles are about 
secure  data  sharing  about  healthcare,  Prediction  of  Dengue  Infected  Areas,  Electronic  Medical  Records 
(EMR). 

   This  article  is  regarding  the  Prediction  of  Dengue  Infected  Areas  using  the  technology  of  the 
Crowdsourcing  Framework  [57].  By  using  this  technology,  we  can  search  for  the  crowdsourcing  and 
Dengue that can be easily spread to some kind of places and take the patients far from that place and use 
Ethereum-blockchain to recover the sanctuary of the background and avoid fake area information. 

  Another  group  of  articles  regarding  blockchain-Based  Information  EMR  in  a  Health  care 
Communication Scheme here presents a blockchain-based show for securing EMR [76]. Utilized SHA256 
protected  hash  calculation  for  creating  a  special  and  alike  256-bit  or  32-byte  hash  rate  for  a  specific 
therapeutic result. 

The  situation  of  the  health  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  not  much  good.  There  are  corruption  and 
mismanagement which reduce the hope of the patient to get proper treatments [93]. If it is probable to assure 
proper usage of blockchain technology it will beneficial for all. Possible implementation domains could be 
Covid-19  vaccine  supply,  medicine  supply,  specialist  doctor  information,  data  security  of  medical 
organizations. 

4.1.3. Security 

After  Governance,  the  articles  are  mostly  found  which  are  related  to  security  (Table-11).  From  (70) 
articles  we  find  out  (18)  security-related  articles.  These  articles  are  about  Security  management,  Attack 
Detection, Examining Usability Issues, Data security, Secure Data Transaction. 

First article is regarding the improvement of data security through blockchain, Like data access from 
cloud data storing by unapproved clients [34]. This exertion employs thumbprint as a biometric method 
and progressed encoding usual as a reliable encoding framework. 

Another group of article is blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Wallets [77]. This article investigates the 
common convenience topics with computer and cell or phone-based cases and the consequences uncover 
that mutual wallet need great convenience in executing the basic assignments which are going to be better

In  Bangladesh, blockchain-security  related  articles  are  quite  familiar  and  that  kind  of technology  is 
being used in different kinds of technological sectors also. For that reason, different kinds of crime are being 
prevented. Possible implementation domains could be secure mobile banking, data transfer. 

4.1.4. Privacy 

From (70) articles there are only (7) articles regarding Privacy in (Table-11). These articles are about 

Implementation for Smart Cities, Smart National Identity Card, Privacy-friendly platform for healthcare. 

This  article  is  related  to  blockchain-built  SDN-IoT  constructional  security  with  NFV  Execution  for 
Canny Cities where planning for smart cities has been planned [27]. The architecture safeguards metadata 
within individual coating in addition to load the process. 

Another  article  is  about  the  Protected  Smart  National  Identity  Card  Management  proposal  using 
blockchain  [43].  Here  in  this  article,  most  recent  improvements  in  the  field  of  NID  card  framework  by 
implementing blockchain as a model where moreover talk about the working process of blockchain besides 
the contests confronted and upcoming points of view are also elaborated. 

Bangladesh is a country where privacy can be unlocked very easily and the security system is not up 
to the mark4. The data is being stolen very easily by any person or any organization. We need to work on it. 

4.1.5. Survey 

 We find out only (4) articles regarding surveys using blockchain technology (Table-11). These articles 
are about the challenges and needs of blockchain software, File System and Securely Manageable (EMR), 
Feedback on Blockchain Technology. 

An  article  is  related  to  a  feedback  system  using  blockchain  technology  [39].  In  that  article  digital 
feedback system will be utilized where input will be guaranteed with the namelessness of the users and 
also make sure the belief of users is being stalled when feedback is given. Moreover, it'll grant a thought of 
how the people of an organization think about certain themes. 

Another  article  is  about  software  expansion  applies  of  blockchain  schemes  [82],  which  is  also  an 
inspection-based  article  which  investigates  the  program-building  practices  of  these  ventures.  Computer 
program building strategies counting challenging and sanctuary best hones got to be adjusted with reality 
to discourse the exceptional features of blockchain. 

Bangladesh is a developing country and needs to make more surveys about blockchain technology. 
“The survey articles are not very much available in our country”, stated according to an official statement 
by the Bangladesh National Bank. From these survey-type articles, we can understand which technology 
is easy to be executed by exact end-user and which is beneficial for all. We need to work more on this. 

4.1.6. Review 

Regarding the review of sub-domains, there are only (2) articles to found in (Table-11). Those articles 

are about Healthcare applications and SDN and blockchain-based IoT Countermeasures. 

The  first review  article  is  about  developing blockchain technology  in  Health care Applications  [75]. 
This considers methodically looks all-important explore articles about blockchain in the healthcare system 
in  three  available  catalogues.  They  think  about  utilizing  the  characterized  catchphrases  'blockchain', 
‘electronic health archives’, ‘health care and their varieties’. 

Another article talks about approximately SDN and blockchain built IoT Countermeasures [50]. Here, 
watching  the  IoT  arranged  highlights,  security  details,  and  contests  conjointly  profound  inquire  about 
approximately SDN and blockchain-grounded which are tended for IoT to organize and also sanctuary with 
the scenario. 

There  is  a  lack of research  into the  use  of blockchain  technology.  Researchers  should  focus  on  sub-
domains  such  as  medical  and  healthcare  applications,  Agricultural  applications,  Banking  sector,  etc. 
Students need to come forward to find new inventions regarding this technology. 

4.1.7. Data 

There  are  only  (3)  articles  found  in  (Table-11),  regarding  data.  Those  articles  are  about  Data 

Distribution, Data Sharing, and Remote Database Access. 

4 https://www.thedailystar.net/law-our-rights/urge-enact-privacy-and-data-protection-law-1527220 

www.aetic.theiaer.org 

                                                             
AETiC 2022, Vol. 6, No. 1 

20 

So, the first article is about blockchain Networks Using Lapping Information Delivery [90], and it will 
be reducing storage requirements. In this article, a strategy to separate the entire blockchain of contacts and 
a variety of duplicates has been proposed. At that point, these shards are distributed consistently over the 
nodes within the organization. 

Another  article  is  about  the  Addition  of  blockchain  and  Further  Records  to  Get  to  the  Protocol-
Grounded  Record  [80].  This  article  recommends  utilizing  blockchain  for  fortifying  small  tries  against 
hacking  by  disturbing  the  organization  at  any  point  of  completing  any  changes  to  all  the  data  without 
utilizing the official channels. It will be completed by the blockchain technology’s innate hash repetition 
and withdrawal calculation. 

The next article is regarding data security but data analysis articles are not sufficient in Bangladesh. 
Data is not much secure in our country. So, it is needed to research data analysis and statistics to make the 
data  more  secure  and  more  useful.  So  possible  implementation  domains  could  be  data  analysis,  data 
transfer security, and so on. 

4.1.8. Storage 

Only (1) article is being found by us regarding storage (Table-11). The only article is about Increasing 

Throughput and Reducing Storage. 

So, this article is about Growing Quantity and Tumbling Storage Bloating Problem by IPFS and Dual-
blockchain Method [31]. This Paper is persuaded due to the need for versatility on the prevailing blockchain 
innovations. A conveyed capacity  framework  IPFS  is utilized to  avoid putting absent  obligations  and to 
expand output. 

There are very few articles and papers that are published in the storage sub-domain. In Bangladesh, 
storage-related  papers  and  articles  are  not  popular  because  the  capability  to  maintain  the  storage  and 
usability of data storage is not sufficient. Most of the web domains are being outsourced because storage is 
not sufficient. So, storage-related research and articles are not justified for our country. If the government 
take  proper  steps,  storage-based  domain-related  work  can  be  made  a  huge  opportunity  for  blockchain 
technology. 

4.1.9. Architecture 

Like review, there are only (2) articles regarding architecture that we found in (Table-11). Those articles 
are about ASIC-resistant for blockchain systems and another one is Efficient blockchain Segmented Work. 
So,  the  first  article  is  about  ASIC-resistant  Proof-of-Work  for  blockchain  systems  [45].  This  article 
proposed  a  Filtered  Proof-of-Work  (FPoW)  and  its’  ASIC-resistivity  is  assessed  to  create  an  upcoming-
resistant ASIC-resistant agreement convention. 

Another article  is  about Efficient  blockchain  systems based  on  Proof of  Segmented  Work  [32]. This 
system  is  attempted  to  decrease  energy  utilization  by  restricting  the  interest  of  all  the  hubs  within  the 
network by putting a parcel of emphasis on the concept of fair reward distribution which isn't considered 
in most cryptocurrencies. 

Blockchain Architectural articles can improve the architectural situation of our country’s data security. 
Every  year  lots  of  websites  and  data  are  being  hacked  and  stolen  by  hackers.  If  the  research  regarding 
architecture is performed well the security will be increased enormously. For that, the Bangladeshi author 
should focus on blockchain architecture significantly. Thus, some possible implementation domains could 
be Hierarchical Blockchain, Edge Computing, and so on.  

4.1.10. Information Verification 

Like storage, there are only (1) article regarding Information Verification that we found in (Table-11). 

This article is about Fake News Detection. 

The  article  is  about  Fake  News  Detection  in  communal  media  exploitation  of  blockchain  [54].  This 
article  is  studied  based  on  Fake  news,  which  is  more  appealing  than  the  genuine  one.  In  this  way, 
individuals  got  to  be  confused.  Utilizing  the  preferences  of  blockchains  peer-to-peer  arranged  concepts 
identify fake news in social media. 

In  our  country  Rumours  is  a  common  incidence.  People  take  action  without  judging  the  right 
information. For that reason, there  is a lot of harm and damage that has been done in our country. It’s a 
political, or even become an economic issue sometimes. It will be justified, if Information verification-related 

www.aetic.theiaer.org 

AETiC 2022, Vol. 6, No. 1 

21 

blockchain  papers  and  research-related  works  are  focused  properly  in  Bangladesh.  So,  possible 
implementation domains could be Facebook post verification, stock exchange news verification, etc.  

4.1.11. Farming 

Like storage and Information Verification, there are only (1) article regarding farming that had been 

found in (Table-11). This article is about the Unconventional Method of Farming without Mediators. 

The  only  farming  sub-domain  related  article  is  “An  Unconventional  Means  of  Farming  Without 
Mediators through blockchain” [55]. This article is projected on a dispersed agricultural stage, named KHET 
to resolution the specified problems and establishes belief and regionalization between agronomic partners 
such as agronomists, supply corporations, and marketplaces. 

Bangladesh is an agricultural country. 80 percent of the people of our country are directly connected 
and about 90-95 percent of people are indirectly connected with agriculture and farming. So, in this sector 
blockchain  technology  should  grow  up  the  research  for  our  farmers  and  the  interpreters.  By  using  the 
technology, the production and the supply system of farming and agricultural product will be easy and the 
waste of products will get to be decreased. The possible implementation domain could be Farm Product 
Supply in this case. 

4.1.12. Cryptocurrencies 

Like  storage  and  Information  Verification  and  farming,  there  is  only  (1)  article  regarding 

Cryptocurrencies (Table-11).  

This article is about Trustworthy Electronic voting by Familiar blockchain [64]. Electronic voting is a 
productive strategy that seems to offer assistance to individuals who seem not to vote for a restricted period. 
It too solves the issue of long voting time due to numerous voters or more complicated voting steps. So, 
proposing cryptanalysis on a dependable electronic voting plot with blockchain and discovers out that there 
are some issues in the main proposed plot. 

A  cryptocurrency  is  a  digital  medium  of  exchange  such  as  the  US  Dollar.  Cryptocurrency  is  not  a 
regular thing in Bangladesh. Very little amount of paperwork has been done about “Cryptocurrency” in 
Bangladesh. So, more research is needed to execute this technology for Bangladesh.  

4.1.13. Internet 

Like storage and Information Verification and farming, there are also only (1) article found regarding 

Internet (Table-11). This article is about “Secured blockchain-Based Decentralised Internet”. 

 This article proposed a new decentralized internet-based article. This article attempts to depict with 
blockchain technology  into the decentralization  of the  web  [66]. A  decentralized  arrangement  assures to 
empower the web to function from the smart-phone or tablet of anyone rather than centralized servers. 

 In Bangladesh Internet is quite available now. Most of the person knows and uses it for a different 
purpose.  But  the  internet  service  is  not  secure  in  our  country.  Most  of  the  people  got  harassed  on  the 
platform of the internet. Females are mostly the victim of harassment. Blockchain technology can prevent 
such  problems.  So,  we  need  to  work  and  study  internet  based  blockchain  technology.  One  possible 
implementation domain could be Safe Internet Blockchain Security. 

4.2. RQ2: What are the impediments and encounters of blockchain technology adoption in Bangladesh? 

After a thorough analysis of several blockchain technology-related research articles as well as existing 
policies prevailing  in  Bangladesh, this  study  identifies  major challenges  and obstacles  of  this  technology 
adoption in Bangladesh.  

4.2.1. Technical Challenges 

As an underdeveloped country where a limited amount of money is being dedicated to the research 
and development sector, Bangladesh faces several technical limitations. Although blockchain technology 
experience some common technical issues5, how those limitations are affected here are mentioned herewith.  
Immaturity: Blockchain is still immature because it is evolving and this is one of the major limitations 
of blockchain. For immaturity, blockchain cannot be used in a wide range of adoption. However, there are 
few domains in blockchain that are matured to be used in the production environment.

www.aetic.theiaer.org 

                                                             
AETiC 2022, Vol. 6, No. 1 

22 

 Lack  of  Standardization  programming  language:  To  adopt  blockchain,  lack  of  standardization 
programming  language  is  another  problem.  According  to  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC), 
undergraduates’ advice for making a typical Syllabus that is limited to C, C++, Java, C#, PHP, and python 
might not be enough to develop blockchain6. 

Scalability: As previously said, the scalability of major public blockchain schemes is inadequate. The 
private blockchain networks seem to provide greater scalability in principle. However, since their scalability 
is not well known, there is no definitive evidence of it. For any large-scale adoption, this is a long way away. 
Energy  Scarcity:  In  developing  countries  like  Bangladesh,  the  energy  crisis  is  a  major  problem. 
Consensus algorithms (such as Proof of Work) that are used in big public blockchain networks use a lot of 
power. According to the Bitcoin network's current energy usage is about 113.47 TWH, which is equal to 
Netherland's energy consumption [94]. Because of the simplicity of the consensus algorithm used in Bitcoin, 
the rate of energy use rises as Bitcoin's popularity expands. As a result, many people are unsure if this is 
likely to continue in the future. So, energy scarcity is a big problem to adopt blockchain in Bangladesh. 

Internet Scarcity: Internet Scarcity is another major problem in Bangladesh. Rendering the Bangladesh 
Telecommunication Regulatory Commission's (BTRC) figures, the country's net customers totalled 108.188 
million in August 2020, up from 54.120 million after December 2015 [95]. Customers have increased rapidly 
but our capacity is not. Bangladesh is in the 98th position out of 175 nations (speed). 

Security and Vulnerability in Internet Infrastructure: According to Bangladesh Telecommunication 
Regulatory Commission, active internet users were 116.14 million in March 20217. Many national and global 
corporations are facilitating online shopping, banking, communication, and a variety of other e-commerce 
services.  But  the  matter  of  concern  is  that  most  of  the  software  used  in  our  country  is  pirated.  Taking 
advantage of this, criminals infiltrate digital networks and engage in illegal activities like phishing, hacking, 
and stealing personal data and institutional information. 

High Implementation Cost: Implementation of blockchain costs a lot. Because blockchain is a feature-
dependent  technology,  the  ultimate  pricing  will  vary  contingent  on  the  scheme  stipulations.  We  must 
mention that the charge of emerging a blockchain application starts from $5,000 to $200,000 that is too much 
for Bangladesh. It is also one of the obstacles of developing blockchain technology. 

Compatibility  with  already  established  systems:  There  are  many  obstacles  to  adopt  blockchain 
technology  in  Bangladesh  and  one  of  the  causes  is  compatibility  with  the  existing  system.  To  apply 
blockchain  we  are  in  lack  of  expertise,  advanced  technology,  and  so  on.  Moreover,  all  the  people  in 
Bangladesh are still not aware of blockchain technology. They don’t know what is it, how to use it. It feels 
like “an already established system is much easier than blockchain.” For that, it is necessary to adjust to an 
already established system. 

Less opportunity for using paid software: As a developing country, Bangladesh is not technologically 
advanced enough. The implementation cost of blockchain is much higher in our country.  The rate of piracy 
in our county is 92%8. Using paid software cost a lot because generally, we have to buy the software from 
abroad since we are yet not much developed in software industries. In addition, weak law  enforcement, 
and the lacking income, moral degradation, and the lack of awareness of lawbreaking is also the cause. 

4.2.2. Organizational Challenge 

Lack of awareness: Many companies are unaware of the benefits that private blockchain technologies 
will  provide  to  their  operations.  Many  people  believe  in  cryptocurrency  to  be  the  only  usage  case  for 
blockchain, so they treat the two words interchangeably. We can see from the result and analysis only (75) 
articles on (13) sectors in Bangladesh used blockchain technology. 

Lack of regulatory mechanism: Adopters gain hope from a regulatory framework covering any novel 
technology. The lack of such a structure, on the other hand, confuses. From our analysis, Bangladesh has no 
such  regulatory  strategy.  In this paper  [96],  we  find  that  the  law  and  regulatory  policy  because  it could 
impact how far and how fast the technology could develop. This also balances the system risk. 

Legal Concerns about Policy: The Administration of the People's Republic of Bangladesh released the 
National blockchain  Strategy:  “Pathway  to become  a blockchain-enabled  Nation  in 2020.”  But  like  a few

23 

other countries, Bangladesh also banned any sort of cryptocurrencies in 2017. It can be said hostile view 
towards  cryptocurrencies.  Another  sector  except  financial  blockchain  growth  is  slow.  So,  Bangladesh 
government need to change their policy towards blockchain and make a policy that benefits everyone. 

Governance:  Every  blockchain  system's  governance  is  a  key  problem  that  is commonly  ignored.  In 
several cases,  the  governance  of  a blockchain determines  its success  and  adoption.  Surprisingly, various 
facets  of  blockchain  governance  are  analogous  to  how  a  company,  consortium,  or  group  of  companies 
distributes  responsibility  within  themselves.  Before  deciding  to  use  blockchain  for  their  solutions,  each 
company must consider this. This necessitates a modern governance paradigm, which may be difficult for 
any  organization  to  implement.  Many  organizations  will  benefit  greatly  from  a  controlled  blockchain 
network  (managed  by  the  government  or  any  private  organization)  since  they  would  not  have  to  think 
about governance issues [97]. 

4.2.3. Human Resource Challenges 

As  a new  technology,  there  is  a  lack  of  human  resources  such  as a  team  of  blockchain  experts  and 
technologists.  Our universities and college academicians are very few who are researching on blockchain 
and published their work on blockchain. To overcome this, we need government support. 

Lack of technological expertise: Any new technology faces a skills gap, particularly during its early 
stages of development. Blockchain technology is no exception; blockchain professionals are in short supply 
all over the world. This is especially true in Bangladesh as a developing country in South Asia. Furthermore, 
there is a lack of understanding of Blockchain and its benefits among the general public. 

4.3. RQ3: How Policymakers should approach to adopt the blockchain technology for sustainable 

development in Bangladesh? 

Finally, this study could find some strategies that must be taken by the government, researchers, and 

educationists for sustainable development of Bangladesh. 

4.3.1. Government and Policy-Makers 

Firstly, create research funds for researchers and educational institutes to build infrastructure. 
Secondly, organize national and international seminars and workshops. 
Thirdly, remove policy-oriented barriers in the path to expand blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and Non-

Fungible Token (NFT). 

Fourthly, involve more researchers, teachers, and stakeholders to form strategies with politicians. 

4.3.2. Researchers 

Firstly, researchers must collaborate with international peers, government, and educational institutes 

to form local research institutes that could be solely focused on blockchain technology. 

Secondly, researchers must focus on local priorities (i.e., farming, corruption, education, etc.) precisely 

while developing blockchain-assisted systems.     

4.3.3. Educational Institutes 

Firstly, all the educational institutes must arrange more and more seminars on blockchain technology. 
In  addition, basic blockchain  technology  and cryptocurrency can also be  incorporated  in  undergraduate 
and graduate-level studies [98], which perhaps are hardly practicing in any of Bangladeshi Universities in 
current time [99]. 

Secondly,  the  educational  institutions may  arrange blockchain  and cryptocurrency-related  in-house 

competitions, so that the students are encouraged about executing blockchain in their day-to-day life.  

5. Conclusion:  

This study successfully outlined those Blockchain technology-related articles which are published by 
the Bangladeshi authors in the five most prestigious databases such as IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, 
Taylor  &  Francis,  and  SpringerLink.  By  doing  the  manual  evaluation  of  these  articles  from  those  five 
databases, we separated them into three major domains and  thirteen sub-domains. By doing the manual 
evaluation, we unleashed 70 articles which are Blockchain technology-related articles and also published 
by  the  Bangladeshi  authors.  Moreover,  we  found  out  the  key  concepts  for  each  of  those  articles.

24 

Furthermore, by doing that, we found out that most published articles that are based on the application on 
governance,  security,  and  privacy-related  articles.  It  also  helped  us  to  find  out  those  sectors  that  are 
currently being worked on Blockchain Technology and also needs more future scopes to use the technology 
for the betterment irrespective of the health, data, and architecture of the Bangladeshi people. These kinds 
of  articles  are not sufficient  in  numbers.  So  Future  Bangladeshi researchers  have  lots of  opportunities  to 
work  on  these  sectors.    Besides  that,  this  study  also  outlined  the  future  challenges,  directions,  and 
recommendation-strategies for local government, educational institutions, and researchers. In the end, this 
study concludes that more investment  and hands-on experience from the private and public sectors will 
surely be increased through the real-world deployment of blockchain technology in Bangladesh.
