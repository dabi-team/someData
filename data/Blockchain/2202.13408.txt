ABSTRACT
Byzantine consensus is a critical component in many permissioned
Blockchains and distributed ledgers. We propose a new paradigm
for designing BFT protocols called DQBFT that addresses three
major performance and scalability challenges that plague past pro-
tocols: (i) high communication costs to reach geo-distributed agree-
ment, (ii) uneven resource utilization hampering performance, and
(iii) performance degradation under varying node and network con-
ditions and high-contention workloads. Specifically, DQBFT divides
consensus into two parts: 1) durable command replication without a
global order, and 2) consistent global ordering of commands across
all replicas. DQBFT achieves this by decentralizing the heavy task
of replicating commands while centralizing the ordering process.
Under the new paradigm, we develop a new protocol, Destiny
that uses a combination of three techniques to achieve high per-
formance and scalability: using a trusted subsystem to decrease
consensus’s quorum size, using threshold signatures to attain linear
communication costs, reducing client communication. Our evalua-
tions on 300-replica geo-distributed deployment reveal that DQBFT
protocols achieve significant performance gains over prior art: ≈3x
better throughput and ≈50% better latency.

1 INTRODUCTION
Byzantine consensus protocols are a perfect fit for solving the
agreement problem in consortium Blockchain platforms [8] due
to their ability to shield the system from known but potentially
mistrustful participants while reaching consensus efficiently, as
opposed to Proof-of-Work-based [48] techniques. The fundamental
requirement of any Blockchain platform is scalability to hundreds
of nodes deployed around the world. Traditional Byzantine Fault-
Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols [18, 19, 24, 36, 37] suffer from
intrinsic design issues that inhibit their scalability in geographically
distributed (geo-distributed) deployments.

Most deterministic BFT consensus protocols [18, 24, 26, 36] adopt
the primary-backup approach, where a designated primary replica
is responsible for ordering and replicating the client-submitted
commands among the replicas. Relying on a dedicated replica to
perform both these operations is detrimental to performance, es-
pecially at scale. In particular, such an approach causes a) load
imbalance among primary and backup replicas, because the pri-
mary sends larger messages containing client commands, while
backups send small state messages; b) under utilization of resources
at backup replicas, because the primary saturates its network re-
sources before the replicas, diminishing their individual potential;
c) remote clients to pay high WAN latencies by sending requests to
the primary than clients that are local to the primary; and d) poor
tolerance to primary failures [30]. Client commands in Blockchain
applications (e.g. smart contracts) are typically large in the order of
kilobytes [2, 8] limiting the number of commands that can be sent
by primary using its bandwidth to all replicas.

Existing BFT solutions that overcome these downsides of the
primary-backup approach have drawbacks. Specifically, the rotat-
ing primary [53, 54, 58] and multi-primary [30, 50] approaches do
not take into account many aspects of modern geographically dis-
tributed systems including variations in node hardware, network
bandwidth, and available resources. In such settings, a slow node
can quickly degrade the overall performance. Some decentralized
approaches [9, 29] exploit the commutativity of client commands
and track dependencies to order conflicting commands. This re-
quires additional coordination to process concurrent conflicting
commands degrading performance.

Towards Partial Decentralization. To overcome these drawbacks, we
present DQBFT (for Divide and conQuer BFT), a paradigm for de-
signing highly scalable consensus protocols by partially decentral-
izing the core consensus process into two distinct and concurrent
steps that may be handled at potentially different replicas. Rather
than adopting a completely decentralized approach where individ-
ual replicas replicate commands and also coordinate to find a total
order, DQBFT divides the task of consensus into two: 1) durable
replication of client commands without a global order at correct
replicas, and 2) ordering of the commands to guarantee a total order.
Durable replication is carried out by each individual replica for the
commands it receives from clients, while ordering is performed by
a dedicated sequencer. Ordering involves assigning a global order
to a replica that has proposed a command. Thus, unlike the rotating
primary and other multi-primary techniques [30, 50, 53, 58], our ap-
proach can seamlessly accommodate variations in node hardware,
network bandwidth, and available resources.

The DQBFT approach is unique in that it allows for concurrent
progression of the two stages in the absence of failures. DQBFT uses
separate instances of consensus protocols at individual replicas to
carry out replication providing load balancing of client commands
among the replicas, while another consensus protocol is responsible
for assigning the global order to individual replicas. This simulta-
neous replication and ordering allows DQBFT to avoid the latency
penalties due to the additional communication steps. However, to
limit the impact of Byzantine replicas in certain situations, DQBFT
requires that replication precede global ordering on a per-replica
basis. Decoupling replication from ordering has been proposed in
the crash-fault model [39, 47, 60], but, these protocols do not scale
to hundreds of geo-distributed Byzantine replicas, require special
network hardware, and/or are not oblivious to conflicts.

Towards Highly Scalable Consensus. While the DQBFT paradigm
can be adopted into existing BFT protocols, we show, analytically
in Figure 3 and empirically in Section 5, that such instantiations do
not scale their performance to hundreds of replicas. Therefore, we
present Destiny, the flagship instantiation of the DQBFT paradigm
with three enhancements each of which contribute to achieve high
performance while scaling to hundreds of replicas. Briefly, the

 
 
 
 
 
 
techniques include: (1) using a hardware-assisted trusted subsystem
to increase fault-tolerance and decrease quorum sizes; (2) linear
communication for scalability; and (3) using threshold cryptography
for optimal linear communication.

BFT protocols require 3𝑓 + 1 replicas and three communication
steps among two-thirds of replicas to reach agreement. In contrast,
Hybrid consensus protocols [14, 55] use trusted subsystems to re-
quire only 2𝑓 + 1 replicas and two communication steps among
majority replicas to reach agreement. We show that such efficiency
combined with the reduction in the number of messages exchanged
per commit via linear communication patterns is key in leveraging
the benefits of the DQBFT paradigm at scale (see Figures 2 and 3).
With this insight, we adopt and linearize the common-case com-
munication of a recent Hybrid protocol, Hybster [14], producing
Linear Hybster. Both the replication and ordering steps of Destiny
use instances of Linear Hybster.

The ability of Hybrid protocols to tolerate more faults and use
smaller size quorums enable scalability in geo-distributed environ-
ments. Further, trusted execution environments are now available
at commodity-scale (e.g., Intel SGX [23], ARM’s TrustZone [40]),
making Hybrid protocols more feasible. Regardless, the DQBFT
paradigm is generally applicable to any BFT protocol and does
not require Hybrid fault assumptions. Destiny leverages DQBFT
and the Hybrid model to improve performance. Many Blockchain
solutions already depend on trusted execution environments for
privacy-focused computations [5, 59], and thus, can easily take
advantage of the added performance provided by Hybrid protocols.

Contributions. In Section 2, we discuss the differences between BFT
and Hybrid protocols and the challenges existing in the landscape.
In Section 3, we propose DQBFT, a paradigm for designing scal-
able BFT protocols by partially decentralizing the replication and
ordering concerns. The technique can be applied to most primary-
backup protocols to achieve high performance and scalability. In
Section 4, we propose Destiny, a Hybrid protocol under the DQBFT
paradigm that scales to hundreds of geo-distributed replicas. In
Section 5, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-
the-art protocols and four DQBFT protocols, including Destiny, in
a geo-distributed deployment with various system sizes ranging
from 19 up to 301 replicas, withstanding between 𝑓 = 6 and 150
Byzantine failures. Our evaluations reveal that the DQBFT variants
of PBFT [18], SBFT [26], and Hybster [14] – DQPBFT, DQSBFT,
and DQHybster – outperform their vanilla counterparts with up
to an order of magnitude better performance. Furthermore, these
protocols tolerate lagging replicas better than other multi-primary
protocols with at least 20% better throughput. Destiny provides 40%
better throughput than DQSBFT and up to 70% lower latency than
any other state-of-the-art protocol.

2 BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide the necessary background for under-
standing the rest of the paper.

2.1 Byzantine Consensus
A Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol consists of a
collection of replicas that agree on the order of client-issued com-
mands and execute them in the agreed order. The protocol functions

Balaji Arun and Binoy Ravindran

in a series of views, where in each view, a primary replica proposes
and sequences commands, which are executed by all non-faulty
replicas in the prescribed order. Before executing the commands,
correct replicas must ensure that (i) the commands are replicated
at enough correct replicas and (ii) enough correct replicas observe
the same sequence of commands from the primary. This function is
carried out by the Agreement algorithm, by exchanging command
and state information between replicas. Some BFT agreement algo-
rithms (e.g., PBFT [18]) commit in three phases and require consent
from a supermajority (i.e., 67%) of replicas, while some others (e.g.,
SBFT [26]) require consent from all replicas and commit in two
phases during non-faulty periods.

When the primary ceases to make timely progress or misbehaves
by sending different sequence of commands to different replicas,
the View Change algorithm is invoked by non-faulty replicas to
replace the faulty primary. The primary of the new view, determined
by the view number, collects the replica-local states of enough
replicas, computes the initial state of the new view, and proceeds
with the agreement algorithm in new view. If a view change does
not complete in time, another one is triggered for the next primary.
Replicas use the Checkpoint algorithm to limit their memory
requirements by garbage collecting the states for those commands
that have been executed by enough correct replicas. Replicas ex-
change information to produce the checkpoint state. When some
replicas fall behind the rest of the system, the checkpoint state is
used to bring them up to date via the state transfer algorithm.

2.2 Consensus with Trusted Subsystems
Replicas in the BFT model may fail to send one or more messages
specified by the protocol or even send messages not specified by the
protocol. These replicas can also equivocate, i.e., make conflicting
statements to compromise consistency, without being detected. To
tolerate such behaviors, BFT protocols require at least supermajor-
ity quorums — the subset of replicas that is used to make decisions
at different phases of consensus — in asynchronous systems.

On the other hand, in the hybrid fault model, a trusted subsys-
tem is employed to prevent replicas from equivocating [20, 38]. A
trusted subsystem is a local service that exists at every replica, and
certifies the messages sent by the replicas to ensure that malicious
replicas cannot cause different correct replicas to execute different
sequences of operations. The trusted subsystem, typically, consists
of a monotonically increasing counter that is paired with an at-
testation mechanism (signatures/message authentication codes).
The trusted subsystem assigns a unique counter to a message and
generates a cryptographic attestation over the pair. Thus, each out-
bound message is bound to a unique counter value. When correct
replicas receive the message pairs, they process them in increasing
counter value order. Thus, when a faulty replica sends two different
messages to two different correct replicas, only one will process
the message, while the other will wait for the message with the
missing counter value, eventually detecting equivocation.

Since equivocation is prevented using the trusted subsystem, 𝑓
additional correct replicas that were required for traditional BFT
protocols to balance the impact of 𝑓 malicious replicas are no longer
required in the hybrid fault model. The result is smaller quorums.

(b) Hybster, hybrid protocol

Figure 1: Agreement protocol steps: PBFT and Hybster.

The system size (𝑁 ) of traditional BFT protocols is 3𝑓 + 1; hybrid
protocols improve this to 2𝑓 + 1.

Example 2.1. BFT vs Hybrids. To illustrate the fundamental design
differences between BFT and hybrid protocols, we compare PBFT (a
BFT protocol) and Hybster [14] (a hybrid protocol). The agreement
algorithm of PBFT and Hybster operates in three and two phases,
respectively, as illustrated in Figure 1. Note that we describe the
two protocols hand-in-hand and only highlight their differences.
1 For each protocol, the execution starts when the client sends
a command to the primary replica. The client signs its command to
ensure that a malicious replica cannot tamper the command without
detection. 2 The primary receives the command and proposes it
to all replicas with a sequence number by broadcasting a Prepare
message. The sequence number defines the global execution order
with respect to other commands. The message is certified using
a message authentication code (MAC). Hybster uses the trusted
subsystem to produce the MAC. The counter value of Hybster
maps to the sequence number assigned to the command. Thus, two
different commands are never assigned the same sequence number
in Hybster. Also, note that in the example, Hybster requires three
nodes, while PBFT requires four.

The replicas receive the proposal from the leader. 3 Hybster
replicas acknowledge the proposal to each other. Replicas wait for
a majority of responses to commit and execute the command. 3a
PBFT replicas exchange the proposal with each other to ensure that
they received the same proposal from the primary (i.e., to ensure no
equivocation). Note that Hybster avoids this step using the trusted
subsystem. The proposal is validated if a supermajority of nodes
respond with the same proposal from the primary. 3b PBFT repli-
cas exchange commit messages. They execute the command upon
collecting a majority quorum of these messages and reply to the
client. At the end of this step, in both the protocols, a correct replica
is able to recover the command, even if 𝑓 replicas fail including the
primary. 4 Clients wait until they receive identical replies from at
least 𝑓 + 1 replicas. This is because, waiting for only one potentially
malicious replica may yield an incorrect result.

2.3 Decentralizing Consensus
A major problem with quorum-based BFT consensus protocols
(e.g., PBFT [18], SBFT [26], Hotstuff [58]) that underpin numerous
Blockchain infrastructures [15] is their reliance on a designated

replica, called the primary, to order client commands. The maxi-
mum theoretical throughput at which a primary can replicate client
commands is 𝑇𝑝 = 𝐵/((𝑁 − 1)𝑝𝑚), where 𝐵 is the primary’s net-
work bandwidth and 𝑝𝑚 is the size of payload message and 𝑁 is
the number of replicas [30]. However, to ensure safety, the pri-
mary/replicas exchange state messages with each other and these
messages must be taken into account. Figure 2 presents the the-
oretical throughput equations for protocols including PBFT and
Hybster and Figure 3 plots it for two payload sizes. Note that this
throughput is based on replica bandwidth only; in practice, the
throughput is also affected by available computation and mem-
ory resources. The primary sends (𝑁 − 1)𝑝𝑚 bytes, while other
replicas only receive roughly 𝑝𝑚 bytes each, leading to load im-
balance and underutilization of replica resources. By distributing
the primary’s responsibility and allowing all replicas to replicate
the command payloads concurrently, one can achieve maximum
throughput 𝑇𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥 = (𝑁 𝐹 ·𝐵)/((𝑁 − 1)𝑝𝑚 + (𝑁 𝐹 − 1)𝑝𝑚), where
𝑁 𝐹 is the minimum number of non-faulty replicas (𝑁 − 𝑓 ) and is
different for BFT and Hybrid protocols. The literature presents two
main methodologies to accomplish this.

In the first approach, referred to as static ordering, the sequence
numbers used to order the commands are statically partitioned
among replicas. Replicas use their allocated set of sequence numbers
to propose and commit commands, either in parallel [30] or in
round-robin fashion [58]. To ensure linearizability [33], replicas
must execute commands in the order of their sequence numbers.
Such an approach cannot adapt to variations in node hardware
and network bandwidth. A slow replica can throttle the system
performance as commands must be effectively executed at the speed
at which the slowest replica can propose and commit commands.
Examples of protocols that adopt variants of this approach include
Hotstuff [58], RCC [30], MirBFT [50], and Dispel [57].

In the second approach, referred to as dependency-based ordering,
replicas commit commands by exchanging dependency metadata,
and execute those commands after deterministically ordering them
using the agreed-upon dependency information. The order of exe-
cution of the commands depends on the nature of the operations in
those commands. Commands with conflicting operations are totally
ordered while others are partially ordered [25]. Such dynamic order-
ing minimizes the overhead of ordering non-conflicting commands,
because their reordering does not cause inconsistent system state.
Such protocols [10, 46] incur higher overhead when the number of
conflicting commands is high, degrading performance.

3 THE DIVIDE AND CONQUER PARADIGM
We propose DQBFT, a paradigm for building high-performance
BFT protocols that overcomes the aforementioned challenges in
existing protocols. To do so, DQBFT decentralizes the responsibility
of the primary based on the two important actions performed by a
consensus protocol: i) request dissemination with partial ordering
and ii) global ordering. Request dissemination is a decentralized
operation and does not require replicas to coordinate, but only
acknowledge receipt. In contrast, global ordering requires replicas
to coordinate to ensure that the system has a single view of the
sequence of operations. To simplify this process, a replica is elected
to propose the global ordering for the commands.

Under the DQBFT paradigm, clients can send commands to any
replica. Replicas can individually disseminate and order client com-
mands using multiple instances of a consensus protocol. While this
ensures that the commands are disseminated to the correct replicas,
the order produced is local to the replica, i.e. a partial order, and
not global. The primary replica produces a global order among the
partial orders produced by the individual replicas.

Such a partially-decentralized approach has the following bene-
fits. First, the decentralized process of dissemination distributes load
evenly across replicas and enables clients to connect to the nearest
replica in geo-distributed deployments. Second, for ordering, the
global view of all commands enables the sequencer to order them
optimally, i.e., each newly proposed command can be dynamically
assigned to the first unused global sequence number. Unlike other
multi-primary [30, 50] and rotating-leader [53, 54, 58] protocols
whose performances suffer due to slow replicas, our technique al-
lows replicas to execute commands at their own pace without being
bottle-necked by slower replicas. Moreover, such an approach is
oblivious to conflicts (unlike, for e.g., ezBFT [9], Aliph [29]).

3.1 Design
At a high level, the DQBFT paradigm is composed of two sub-
protocols: the dissemination protocol and the global ordering pro-
tocol. The dissemination protocol employs multiple instances of
consensus, called D-instances, to enable every replica to dissemi-
nate and partially order its client commands. Meanwhile, the global
ordering protocol uses a single instance of consensus, called the
O-instance, that agrees on the global order among the partial orders
produced by the D-instances. There are as many D-instances as
there are replicas, and every replica is the coordinator of at least
one D-instance. A replica proposes commands in a series of se-
quence numbers belonging to its own D-instance to produce its
partial order. The primary proposes D-instance sequence numbers
in O-instance’s sequence number space to effectively produce a
global order from the replica-specific partial orders.

To tolerate Byzantine faults, both dissemination and ordering
should be based on a BFT consensus protocol. Primary-based proto-
cols with the following properties [55] can be used for instantiating
protocols under the DQBFT paradigm.

(P1) If a correct replica executes a command 𝛼 at sequence num-
ber S in view 𝑣, no correct replica will execute 𝛼 ′ ≠ 𝛼 with
sequence number S.

(P2) If a correct replica executed a command 𝛼 at sequence num-
ber S in view 𝑣, no correct replica will execute 𝛼 with se-
quence number S′ > S in any view 𝑣 ′ > 𝑣.

(P3) During a stable view where the communication between
correct replicas is synchronous, a proposed client command
is committed by a correct replica.

(P4) A view 𝑣 will eventually transition to a new view 𝑣 ′ > 𝑣 if

enough correct replicas request for it.

Many primary-based BFT and Hybrid protocols provide these
properties and can be instantiated under the DQBFT paradigm [14,
19, 26, 36]. In Section 5, we evaluate four such instantiations.

In DQBFT, the O-instance primary replica performs a fixed
amount of work. Since the task of disseminating the client com-
mands is offloaded to other replicas, the primary is only responsible
for total-ordering. Furthermore, the use of consensus protocols
for both D-instances and the O-instances allows the dissemination
and the global ordering steps to proceed simultaneously. While
dissemination is in progress, the ordering protocol optimistically
proposes a global ordering for the command. This allows for the
communication steps of both protocols to overlap, and thereby ef-
fectively reduces the overall number of communication steps. Note
that such concurrent processing does not strain the communication
channels. Since the ordering protocol is only ordering the sequence
numbers, the message sizes are constant and are only a few bytes.
The dissemination protocol carries a larger and variable payload
containing the client commands. See Figure 2 for a comparison of
DQBFT protocols and Figure 3 for theoretical throughput analysis.

3.2 DQBFT
In this section, we describe the inner workings of the DQBFT para-
digm and show how it accomplishes its goal of decentralizing the
dissemination and global ordering steps, while preventing slow
replicas from bottle-necking the system performance. For the sake
of exposition, we describe DQBFT by applying it to PBFT. Figure 4
illustrates DQBFT’s separation of dissemination and ordering steps.

3.2.1 Agreement Protocol. Figure 5 presents the agreement proto-
col. We assume that a primary for the O-instance is elected before-
hand. At a high level, a replica 𝑅𝑛 that receives the client command,
say 𝛼, becomes the command’s initial coordinator. We say initial,
because when the coordinator fails, it will be replaced using the
View Change procedure. The coordinator is responsible for partial
ordering 𝛼 with respect to the commands previously coordinated

by it. The coordinator uses its D-instance protocol and assigns a
sequence number S𝑛𝑖 and runs the consensus protocol to dissemi-
nate the command to other replicas. Concurrently, the O-instance
primary optimistically globally orders the D-instance sequence
number S𝑛𝑖 . The O-instance primary uses the PrePrepare message
sent by the D-instance primary as the request for finding the global
order for S𝑛𝑖 . Note that the O-instance protocol only orders the
D-instance sequence numbers, only and not the commands. The
O-instance primary 𝑅𝑝 assigns a sequence number S𝑝𝑘 to the D-
instance number S𝑝𝑘 and sends protocol messages to replicas to
produce a global order for 𝛼.

3.2.2 Execution. A command 𝛼 proposed by replica 𝑅𝑛 is decided at
a replica when it has been committed under a D-instance sequence
number S𝑛𝑖 , and S𝑛𝑖 has been committed under a O-instance se-
quence number S𝑝𝑘 . However, the command cannot be executed
yet. The command is considered ready for execution only after all
the corresponding commands mapped to the O-instance sequence
numbers up to S𝑝𝑘 have been committed and executed. Replicas
execute the command and respond to the client.

3.2.3 Checkpoint and State-transfer Protocols. As described previ-
ously, consensus protocols use the checkpoint mechanism to reduce
the memory footprint at the replicas by garbage collecting logs for
previously executed commands. This procedure also aids in bring-
ing any lagging replicas to the latest state, by allowing up-to-date
replicas to exchange the checkpoint data and recent logs via the
state-transfer protocol. Note that replicas can be lagging as a result
of the primary’s intentions. This has implications for DQBFT.

Example 3.1. Consider a DQBFT instantiation of PBFT with
𝑁 = 4 (𝑓 = 1) replicas. Let 𝑅0 be the O-instance primary and
be Byzantine. Let 𝑅1 and 𝑅2 use their D-instances to commit two
commands, say, 𝛼 and 𝛽, by sending them only to quorum replicas
𝑅0, 𝑅1, and 𝑅2. Let 𝑅0, the O-instance primary, order the D-instances
using quorum replicas 𝑅0, 𝑅1, and 𝑅3. Now, 𝑅1 is the only correct
replica that can execute both the commands and respond to the
client. Neither 𝑅2 nor 𝑅3 have all the necessary O-instance and
D-instance messages, respectively, to execute the commands. Thus,
these replicas must transfer up-to-date state from other correct
replicas before execution.

We now discuss measures to prevent malicious replicas from

stalling the progress of other replicas.

3.2.4 Controlling Byzantine Behavior. Although the optimistic or-
dering mechanism reduces the number of effective communication
steps, Byzantine replicas can still prolong the latency by refusing
to send messages (see Example 3.1), thereby negatively affecting

performance. A common technique to prevent this behavior is by
flooding the D-PrePrepare messages [6]. When a correct replica
receives a D-PrePrepare message, it will multicast the message to
all other replicas. This will ensure that the D-PrePrepare message
will be received by other replicas in one communication step after
it is initially received by a correct replica. In larger systems, we
observed that using a random subset of few replicas was equally
effective while reducing the additional bandwidth requirements.

Despite such techniques, a coordinator can still collude with the
primary and cause a global ordering slot to be committed without
disseminating the command. This will eventually cause a view
change (described below), which when frequent can reduce the
overall performance of the system. To prevent this behavior, we
fall back to a more pessimistic approach on a per D-instance basis.
After a view change, the D-instance will be placed under pro-
bation, during which the O-instance primary will assign sequence
numbers only pessimistically after its commands are disseminated.
If the D-instance appears to behave for a certain period, the op-
timistic mode is restored. The period is denoted using sequence
numbers that exponentially increases with each view change. If cor-
rect replicas identify that the O-instance primary assigns sequence
numbers optimistically for a D-instance on probation period even
after some grace period, the O-instance primary will be replaced via
a view change. During this time, correct replicas will only respond
after the respective command becomes disseminated.

3.2.5 View Change Protocol. There are cases where the coordinator
or the primary does not make progress, either deliberately or due
to other non-Byzantine causes (e.g., network disruptions). The view
change protocol is used to reinstate progress whenever D-instance
coordinator or the O-instance primary fails to do so. One of the
important characteristics of DQBFT is that it adds no additional
complexity to the existing view change procedure of the underlying
consensus protocols. We assume an eventually synchronous [16]
communication between replicas where messages can be lost, be
arbitrarily delayed, or arrive in any order, so it is impossible to
distinguish a Byzantine primary or coordinator that does not send
any messages from a network fault. Thus, such protocols can only
provide progress in periods during which the system is synchronous
and messages arrive in bounded time.

Since, in DQBFT, replicas can serve multiple roles (e.g., primary,
coordinator, backup) at the same time, it is possible that a replica
makes progress on a subset of roles while ceasing progress on other
roles. By using the view change procedures of the respective D-
instances and the O-instance, we ensure that only those primary and
coordinator roles that do not make progress are replaced, without
affecting the other roles. The view change can cause a replica to co-
ordinate multiple D-instances including its own, however a replica
is allowed to propose new commands using only its D-instance.

Case 1: D-instance fails but O-instance is active. A client
sends its command to its assigned coordinator. If it does not receive
𝑓 + 1 responses for its command in time, it forwards the command
to all replicas periodically. If timeouts happen often, a correct client
can adapt by sending future commands to 𝑓 or more replicas. Repli-
cas will respond to the client if they have a reply. Correct replicas
that have not yet seen the D-instance sequence number assigned for
the command will forward the command to the target coordinator

𝑁 instances of the PBFT protocol are used for dissemination. Each replica “owns” one instance and replicates its client commands with
that instance. The prefix "D-" and the replica identifier embedded in the messages helps to identify the protocol instance.
(1) D-PrePrepare. A replica 𝑅𝑛 receives a client command 𝛼 and sends a ⟨D-PrePrepare, 𝑣𝑛, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖, 𝛼⟩ message to all replicas. 𝑣𝑛 is

the view number and S𝑛𝑖 is the lowest available sequence number.

(2) D-Prepare. A replica 𝑅𝑚 that receives a PrePrepare message ⟨D-PrePrepare, 𝑣𝑛, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖, 𝛼⟩ ensures the validity of the view and

sequence numbers. Consequently, 𝑅𝑚 sends a ⟨D-Prepare, 𝑣𝑛, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖, 𝐻𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝛼)⟩ message to all the replicas.

(3) D-Commit. A replica that collects 2𝑓 + 1 valid D-Prepare messages, sends the ⟨D-Commit, 𝑣𝑛, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖, 𝐻𝑎𝑠ℎ(𝛼)⟩ message. A replica

that receives 2𝑓 + 1 valid Commit messages marks the operation as disseminated.

Global Ordering Protocol
(1) O-PrePrepare. Case (i): If 𝑅𝑛 is in optimistic mode, then the primary 𝑅𝑝 of the global ordering protocol assigns a global ordering
number S𝑝𝑘 as soon as it receives the ⟨D-PrePrepare, 𝑣𝑛, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖, 𝛼⟩ message from 𝑅𝑛. Case (ii): If 𝑅𝑛 is in pessimistic mode, then
𝑅𝑝 assigns S𝑝𝑘 only after the operation corresponding to sequence number S𝑛𝑖 is marked as disseminated. Once assigned, Primary
𝑅𝑝 sends the ⟨O-PrePrepare, 𝑣𝑝, 𝑅𝑝, S𝑝𝑘, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖 ⟩ message to all replicas.

(2) O-Prepare. A replica 𝑅𝑞 that receives the ⟨O-PrePrepare, 𝑣𝑝, 𝑅𝑝, S𝑝𝑘, 𝑅𝑛, S𝑛𝑖 ⟩ message ensures the validity of the view and
sequence numbers. 𝑅𝑞 also ensures that there exists a corresponding D-PrePrepare message, waiting if necessary. It then sends a
⟨O-Prepare, 𝑣𝑝, 𝑅𝑝, S𝑝𝑘 ⟩ message to all the replicas.

(3) O-Commit. A replica collects 2𝑓 + 1 valid O-Prepare messages, and sends the ⟨O-Commit, 𝑣𝑝, 𝑅𝑝, S𝑝𝑘 ⟩ message. A replica that
receives 2𝑓 + 1 valid Commit messages commits its sequence number S𝑝𝑘 to map to 𝑅𝑛’s sequence number S𝑛𝑖 and starts the
execution procedure.

and wait for the coordinator to assign a sequence number under its
D-instance and send the initial message. If the timers expire before
receiving the message, correct replicas will invoke the view-change
procedure for that D-instance. The failure of a D-instance does not
affect the O-instance progress, but can affect the execution phase.
With the optimistic mode, it is possible that the O-instance primary
globally orders the D-instance sequence number, but the sequence
number did not commit before the view change, and no correct
replica is aware of the command in that sequence number. Thus,
total ordering of command and execution must wait until a new
coordinator is chosen for the D-instance, and it disseminates either
a command or a special no-op command. The no-op is proposed for
all for sequence numbers that do not have a command associated
but were committed in the O-instance

Case 2: O-instance fails but D-instances are active. When
the O-instance primary fails, D-instances will continue dissemi-
nating commands, but they will not be globally ordered. After the
O-instance undergoes a view change, D-instances must send their
request to the new O-instance primary. The respective D-instance
coordinator and a subset of correct replicas (see Section 3.2.4) will
periodically send the D-PrePrepare to the new primary until the O-
PrePrepare is received. A client can also time out if the O-instance
primary fails to make timely progress. Correct replicas monitor the
O-instance primary to ensure that it assigns corresponding global
sequence numbers for those commands that have been disseminated
in time. A view-change is triggered if the timer expires.

Case 3: Both O-instance and D-instance fail simultaneously.

The failure of the O-instance primary or a D-instance coordina-
tor does not affect other active D-instances from disseminating
commands. We run the view change protocols for the failed in-
stances individually. If the D-instance finishes view change before
O-instance does, it can continue disseminating new commands

(same as Case 2). If the O-instance finishes view change before
D-instance does, the O-instance will receive and order the sequence
numbers for active D-instances (same as Case 1). If the new pri-
mary or coordinator fails to make progress, the respective instance
undergoes another view change.

When a previously failed replica restarts, the view-change proto-
col is used to reinstate the replica’s D-instance, i.e. make the original
replica the coordinator of its D-instance. After the replica restarts,
other replicas will trigger a view change, skipping views if neces-
sary, to reinstate the replica immediately. Note that 𝑓 + 1 replicas
must agree to skipping views, so Byzantine replicas alone cannot
reinstate. A correct replica will ensure that a recovered replica is
participating in the protocol as a health check before agreeing to
the view-change. Once reinstated, the replica must face probation.

3.2.6 Client. A client command contains an operation and a mono-
tonically increasing timestamp. Every replica caches the last exe-
cuted timestamp and the reply for each client. This is used to ensure
that the replicas do not execute duplicate operations and to provide
a reply to the client when required. Similar to other multi-primary
protocols, each client is assigned to a replica to prevent request
duplication attacks, where faulty clients can send duplicate com-
mands to multiple replicas simultaneously. Even though replicas
deduplicate commands during execution preserving safety, it can
nullify the throughput improvements achieved by using multiple
primaries. In DQBFT, this assignment is carried out by running
consensus on a special ASSIGN message via the O-instance.

3.3 Correctness
DQBFT guarantees the following properties of a consensus protocol:
- Safety. Any two correct replicas will execute the same sequence

of client requests.

Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance via Partial Decentralization

- Liveness. A client request proposed by a replica will eventually

be executed by every correct replica.

Theorem 3.7. A command sent by a correct client is eventually

executed by correct replicas.

Lemma 3.2. If a correct replica executes a command 𝛼 whose D-
instance sequence number S𝑛𝑖 is mapped to O-instance sequence
number S𝑝𝑘 in view 𝑣, no correct replica will execute 𝛽 ≠ 𝛼 at O-
instance sequence number S𝑝𝑘 in view 𝑣.

Proof. The D-instance and O-instance protocols satisfy Prop-
erty P1 (Section 3). Consequently, 𝛼 is committed by replica 𝑅𝑛’s D-
instance at sequence number S𝑛𝑖 by correct replicas. Furthermore,
S𝑛𝑖 is the value committed at O-instance number S𝑝𝑘 . Assume
that a correct replica 𝑅𝑚 executes 𝛽 at S𝑝𝑘 . This would entail that
either (i) 𝛽 was committed at S𝑛𝑖 by correct replicas, or (ii) some
S𝑛 𝑗 assigned to 𝛽 was committed at O-instance S𝑝𝑘 instead of S𝑛𝑖 .
□
This contradicts Property P1.

Lemma 3.3. If a correct replica executes a command 𝛼 whose D-
instance sequence number S𝑛𝑖 is mapped to O-instance sequence
number S𝑝𝑘 in view 𝑣, no correct replica will execute 𝛽 ≠ 𝛼 at O-
instance sequence number S𝑝𝑘 in any view 𝑣 ′ > 𝑣.

Proof. The individual consensus instances satisfy Property P2.
The property ensures that if a command is chosen at a sequence
number, it will remain chosen at that sequence number at all higher
views. Thus, 𝛼 remains chosen at S𝑛𝑖 at all higher views. Similarly,
S𝑛𝑖 is mapped to S𝑝𝑘 at all higher views. Suppose a correct replica
executes 𝛽 at view 𝑣 ′ > 𝑣. Then either (i) 𝛽 is assigned to S𝑛𝑖 by
correct replicas, or (ii) some S𝑛 𝑗 assigned to 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎 was committed
at O-instance S𝑝𝑘 instead of S𝑛𝑖 . Both the conditions contradict
□
Property P2.

Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 satisfy the following theorem for safety:

Theorem 3.4. Any two correct replicas commit the same sequence

of operations.

Lemma 3.5. During a stable view of the O-instance and the D-
instance, a proposed client command is executed by a correct replica.

Proof. In a stable view, the correct primary will propose client
requests in a timely fashion to the replicas (Property P3). Thus, the
D-instance primary will ensure dissemination of the client requests.
Since there are at most 𝑓 faulty replicas, there will remain 𝑁 − 𝑓
correct ones that will respond to the primary’s messages. Thus,
the client commands will be committed during the view by correct
replicas after receiving from a correct D-instance primary. The O-
instance primary, being one of the correct replicas, will receive the
D-instance primary’s PrePrepare with the client command and
sequence number. The correct O-instance primary will send the
D-instance sequence number as its command to correct replicas,
and it will be committed in the view. Thus, the client command
will be assigned a global order by correct replicas mapping the
D-instance sequence number to the corresponding O-instance. □

Lemma 3.6. A view 𝑣 will eventually transition to a new view

𝑣 ′ > 𝑣 if at least 𝑁 − 𝑓 replicas request for it.

Proof. The proof follows directly from Property P4 applied to
□

both the D-instances and the O-instance.

Proof. During a stable view, Lemma 3.5 shows that the proposed
command is learned by the correct replicas. When the view is
unstable and the replica timers expire properly, 𝑓 +1 correct replicas
will request a view change. By Lemma 3.6, a new view 𝑣 ′ will be
installed. However, if less than 𝑓 + 1 replicas request the view
change, then the remaining replicas that do not request the view
change will follow the protocol properly. Thus, the system will stay
in view 𝑣 and the replicas will continue to commit commands in
the view. When proposals are not committed in time or when more
than 𝑓 replicas request a view change, then all correct replicas will
request a view change, and it will be processed as in Lemma 3.5.

Even after a view change, the new view 𝑣 ′ may not necessarily
be stable. If the new primary deviates from the algorithm or does
not make timely progress, correct replicas will request another view
change and move to the next view. Since there can only be at most
𝑓 faulty replicas, after at most 𝑓 + 1 view changes, a stable view
will be installed. Furthermore, if the faulty primary follows the
algorithm enough such that a view change cannot be triggered, by
□
Lemma 3.5, replicas will continue to commit the commands.

The individual consensus protocols satisfy linearizability [19].
The following theorem states that a command executed after com-
mitting via a D-instance and an O-instance satisfy linearizability.

Theorem 3.8. Linearizability: If 𝛼 and 𝛽 are commands, and the
request for 𝛽 arrives after 𝛼 is ready, then 𝛼 will be executed before 𝛽.

Proof. When 𝛼 is ready, there must be at least 𝑖 O-instance
sequence numbers belonging to 𝑅𝑛. We prove this by contradiction.
Assume there are less than 𝑖 sequence numbers for 𝑅𝑛, but 𝛼 is
ready. This can happen only because there is a view change, and
correct replicas observe less than 𝑖 sequence numbers. However,
since 𝛼 was ready for execution before the view change, there is at
least one correct replica that will ensure that the primary of the new
view enforces no less than 𝑖 instances, which is a contradiction.

When 𝛽 is received after 𝛼 is ready, there should be at least 𝑖
O-instance sequence numbers committed belonging to 𝑅𝑛. There
exists two cases. Case (i): If the O-instance primary is non-faulty,
it will only assign sequence numbers in monotonically increasing
order, so there will be no empty slots. Case (ii): After a O-instance
view change, correct replicas will observe at least 𝑖 sequence num-
bers belonging to 𝑅𝑛 since 𝛼 is ready, and they will ensure that the
□
new primary enforces the 𝑖 sequence numbers for 𝑅𝑛.

4 DESTINY
Although DQBFT is a general paradigm that can benefit any primary-
based BFT protocol, our performance evaluation (in Section 5) re-
veals that not all protocols equally benefit from this approach. In
this section, we present Destiny, an instantiation of DQBFT that is
custom designed for scaling to hundreds of replicas, and achieve
consistently high throughput and low latency even under high
loads. Destiny is able to take advantage of DQBFT and achieve
higher performance than state-of-the-art techniques [30, 50] at the
scale of tens to hundreds of replicas.

Destiny assumes the Hybrid fault model in order to tolerate
more faults than BFT protocols for the same system size and also
benefit from smaller quorums (𝑓 + 1 instead of 2𝑓 + 1). Destiny
leverages a custom variant of Hybster [14], called Linear Hybster,
to achieve its goal of higher performance and greater scalability.
Linear Hybster improves Hybster’s normal-case communication
complexity from quadratic to linear using threshold signatures and
specialized collector roles. The collector aggregates messages from
replicas and re-broadcasts them to all replicas. Since the messages
are cryptographically signed, threshold signatures [17, 49, 51] are
used to reduce the number of outgoing collector messages from
linear to constant. The same mechanism is employed for responding
to the client. Clients wait for a single aggregated reply from a
collector replica, instead of waiting for replies from 𝑓 + 1 replicas.
The collector replica collects the signatures from 𝑓 + 1 replicas and
sends a single response and signature to the client.

4.1 Fault Assumptions and Cryptography
Destiny assumes the Hybrid fault model – the BFT model aug-
mented with trusted hardware – in which replicas can behave
arbitrarily, except the trusted subsystem, which can only fail by
crashing. Every replica, however, is capable of producing crypto-
graphic signatures [34] that faulty replicas cannot break. We also
assume a computationally bounded adversary that cannot do bet-
ter than known attacks. The communication between replicas and
clients is authenticated using public key infrastructures (PKI) such
as TLS. Being a hybrid protocol, Destiny only requires 𝑁 = 2𝑓 + 1
replicas to tolerate 𝑓 arbitrary failures.

We consider an adversary that controls all the system software
including the operating system. However, the adversary cannot
read or modify the trusted subsystem’s memory at run-time or
decipher the secrets held inside it. Furthermore, the trusted sub-
system is capable of generating cryptographic operations that the
adversary cannot break. We also assume that the adversary cannot
compromise the trusted subsystem’s protections on participating
nodes (e.g., via physical attacks). Preventing rollback attacks require
replicating the subsystem state [44], which hybrid protocols per-
form during agreement implicitly. Any compromise of the trusted
component leads to safety violation of the protocol. Addressing
this limitation is left as future work.

Destiny uses threshold signatures to aggregate signatures at the
collector. The threshold signature with a threshold parameter 𝑡
allows any subset 𝑡 from a total of 𝑛 signers to produce a valid
signature on any message. It also ensures that no subset less than
size 𝑡 can produce a valid signature. For this purpose, each signer
holds a distinct private signing key that can be used to generate the
corresponding signature share. The signature shares of a signed
message can be combined into a single signature that can be verified
using a single public key. We use a threshold signature scheme based
on Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures [43]. We use the BLS12-
381 [13] signature scheme that produces 192-byte signature shares.
The aggregate signatures are also 192 bytes long.

4.2 The ThreshSign Subsystem
The ThreshSign subsystem is a local service that exists on every
replica. It allows for creating and verifying different types of thresh-
old signatures for a message 𝑚 using a specified counter 𝑡𝑐 and
a corresponding counter value 𝑡𝑣. By hosting part of ThreshSign
in a trusted subsystem, ThreshSign guarantees a set of properties
(described later) even if the replica is malicious.
ThreshSign provides the following functions:

• Independent Counter Signature Shares with input (𝑚, 𝑡𝑐,
𝑡𝑣 ′). ThreshSign generates such a signature for a message 𝑚 if the
provided new value 𝑡𝑣 ′ for counter 𝑡𝑐 is greater than its current
value 𝑡𝑣. It updates the counter 𝑡𝑐’s value to 𝑡𝑣 ′ and computes a
signature share using the subsystem’s instance ID, counter 𝑡𝑐’s
ID, its new value 𝑡𝑣 ′, current value 𝑡𝑣, and the message 𝑚.

• Aggregate Signature Shares. It returns a single signature by

aggregating at least 𝑡 valid threshold signatures.

• Verify Signature. It verifies the aggregated signature 𝑠𝑖𝑔 using
the public key and indicates whether message 𝑚 was signed by 𝑡
replicas with counter value 𝑡𝑣 of counter 𝑡𝑐.

• Continuing Counter Certificates with input (𝑚, 𝑡𝑐, 𝑡𝑣, 𝑡𝑣 ′).
ThreshSign generates a message authentication code (MAC) cer-
tificate for a message 𝑚 if the submitted new value 𝑡𝑣 ′ for counter
𝑡𝑐 is greater than or equal to its current value 𝑡𝑣. It updates the
counter 𝑡𝑐’s value to 𝑡𝑣 ′ and computes a signature share using
its private key share, the subsystem’s instance ID, counter 𝑡𝑐’s
ID, its new value 𝑡𝑣 ′, current value 𝑡𝑣, and the message 𝑚.
• Verify Certificate with input (𝑚, 𝑚𝑎𝑐, 𝑡𝑐, 𝑡𝑣, 𝑡𝑣 ′). It verifies the
MAC certificate 𝑚𝑎𝑐 using the secret key and returns true if
message 𝑚 is assigned a continuing certificate that transitions
the counter 𝑡𝑐 from 𝑡𝑣 to 𝑡𝑣 ′.
ThreshSign also provides the capabilities of TrInX [14, 38], the
original Hybster’s trusted component to aid the view change and
state transfer mechanisms. We implement the ability to instantiate
ThreshSign’s multiple instances within a single trusted subsystem.
Every instance can host a variable number of counters as needed
by the protocol. For instance, Hybster requires certificates using
at least three different counters for different protocol phases (e.g.,
checkpoints, view changes). Furthermore, the signing and the certi-
fying functions must be hosted securely along with the private keys
inside the trusted subsystem, while the signature aggregation and
verification functions may be hosted outside as they only deal with
public keys. We rely on attestation services provided by hardware
vendors to verify that the secure code is running inside the enclave
and perform any initialization steps.

4.3 Linear Hybster
We now discuss the modifications to Hybster [14], to achieve linear
communication in the common case to create Linear Hybster.

Figure 6a shows Linear Hybster’s execution steps in the normal
case. Hybster commits a command in two steps and requires clients
to wait for 𝑓 + 1 replies. A quadratic number of Commit messages
are exchanged by replicas in an all-to-all communication, which
bottlenecks throughput. We use a collector and an additional com-
munication step to reduce this quadratic communication to linear.
In Linear Hybster, replicas send the Commit messages to a collector
(up to 𝑓 + 1 can be used for fault-tolerance), which aggregates at

Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance via Partial Decentralization

least 𝑓 + 1 messages and sends them to other replicas. Hybster
uses TrInX, a trusted MAC provider which requires any pair of
replicas to use unique secret keys to exchange messages between
them. We replace TrInX with ThreshSign subsystem. ThreshSign is
configured with a threshold of 𝑓 + 1 out of 𝑁 = 2𝑓 + 1 total replicas.

(a) Linear Hybster

Figure 6: Linear Hybster and Destiny Agreement Protocol.

(b) Destiny

Hybster (and most BFT protocols) require that the clients wait
for equivalent replies from at least 𝑓 + 1 replicas to defend against
incorrect responses from malicious replicas. Linear Hybster, in con-
trast, reduces this 𝑓 + 1 communication to one single message using
threshold signatures. For this purpose, Linear Hybster uses another
instance of threshold signatures, 𝜋, with threshold 𝑓 + 1. Now, once
the client command is executed at each replica, the result of execu-
tion is signed using 𝜋 and sent to the collector in a ExecSig message.
The collector collects and aggregates signature shares from 𝑓 + 1
valid ExecSig messages and generates an ExecProof message. This
message is sent to the replicas as well as the client along with the
result of execution. The client validates the aggregated signature,
accepts the result, and returns.

View Change. A replica triggers a view change if it does not
receive timely messages from the leader, or if it receives a proof that
the leader is faulty (either via a publicly verifiable contradiction
from the client or when 𝑓 + 1 replicas complain).

Replica 𝑅𝑚 supports a new primary 𝑅′

𝑝 of a view 𝑣 + 1 by sending
a ViewChange message with the Prepares for all order numbers
in its current ordering window in view 𝑣. A continuing counter
certificate is attached to the message to ensure that even if replica
𝑅𝑖 is faulty, it includes all the Prepares it is aware of up to the
current order number. After sending the ViewChange message for
𝑣 + 1, replica 𝑅𝑚 is prohibited from participating in view 𝑣. Due
to the use of continuing counter certificates, a new leader 𝑅′
𝑝 can
determine all the proposals of the former primary 𝑅𝑝 by collecting
only a quorum of ViewChange messages.

Once a correct leader 𝑅′

𝑝 collects at least 𝑓 + 1 ViewChange
messages, it begins constructing the new view. It is possible that the
new leader is lagging behind the current ordering window, in which
case the new leader invokes the state-transfer protocol to request
the checkpoint messages and the service state from an up-to-date
replica. A replica cannot establish as a new leader until its ordering

window matches with the ViewChange messages. Since only 𝑓
replicas can be faulty at most, there is at least one correct replica
that contains the adequate information to help the new primary
move to the new ordering window.

Unlike the agreement protocol, the view change mechanism uses
continuing counter certificates provided by ThreshSign. For a view
change, replicas individually must announce their current view and
their intended view, unlike normal case execution where replicas
jointly accept a proposed command. Continuing counter certificates
serve this purpose well, allowing replicas to individually prove their
log state to other replicas and the new primary.

4.4 Protocol
Destiny is obtained by instantiating DQBFT using the Linear Hyb-
ster protocol presented in Section 4.3. Destiny uses 7𝑁 messages
and five phases in the optimistic case (seven in the pessimistic
case) to execute each command (see Figure 2). Due to linear com-
munication, Destiny’s theoretical throughput closely matches the
maximum concurrent throughput (Figure 3). For brevity, we provide
an overview of Destiny, leveraging the description in Section 3.

4.4.1 Agreement Protocol. Destiny commits both D-instances and
O-instances strictly using the Linear Hybster protocol after being
accepted by a majority, requiring a total of four communication
steps. Note that the O-instance starts after the first communication
step of the D-instance. Verification of execution results takes an
additional two communication steps. The messages in the normal
phase protocol are signed by invoking the Independent Counter
Signature Shares function of the corresponding ThreshSign instance.
This ensures the following properties: (i) Uniqueness: the same
counter value is not assigned to two different messages, and (ii)
Monotonicity: the counter value assigned to a message will always
be greater than the previous counter value.

4.4.2 Execution and Acknowledgement. Replicas execute commands
as they become ready for execution. After execution, as in Linear
Hybster, replicas forward the signed result to a collector, which
then aggregates 𝑓 + 1 signatures. The collector sends this signature
back to the replicas and to the client, indicating that the client’s
command was executed. Note that this step does not require the
use of the trusted subsystem.

4.4.3 Checkpoint, State-transfer and View change Protocols. Des-
tiny uses the respective checkpoint, state-transfer, and view change
algorithms of the underlying Linear Hybster protocol.

Example 4.1. Figure 6b illustrates with an example of how Des-
tiny commits a command using the D- and O-instance protocols.
Assume that 𝑅1 serves the primary role in the O-instance pro-
tocol. A client submits command 𝛼 to replica 𝑅0. 𝑅0 becomes the
initial coordinator of 𝛼. We call it initial because if it fails, some
other replica will take over. We also assume that 𝑅0 and 𝑅1 will play
the collector roles for the D-instance and O-instance, respectively.
A replica playing the collector role is responsible for collecting
signature shares, aggregating them, and multicasting the combined
signature. 𝑅0 selects the lowest unused sequence number in its
D-instance space, assigns it to 𝛼, and disseminates the command
by multicasting a D-Prepare message.

R0R1R2PrepareCommitSigCommitRequestExecSig⍺ReplyC0R0R1R2R0PrepareCommitSigCommitRequestExecSig⍺ReplyC0R1R2𝒟𝒪PrepareCommitSigCommit𝑅1 receives the D-Prepare message and triggers the O-instance
protocol for replica 𝑅0. 𝑅1 proposes 𝑅0’s ID and 𝛼’s sequence num-
ber to the next available O-instance sequence number (say 𝑗) and
sends a O-Prepare message. Replicas accept either Prepare mes-
sages and send the corresponding D-CommitSig and O-CommitSig
messages, respectively, to the commit collectors, 𝑅0 and 𝑅1. The
D-CommitSig and the O-CommitSig messages are signed by the 𝜎0
and 𝜏 ThreshSign instances, respectively. The respective commit
collectors wait for at least 𝑓 + 1 valid D-CommitSig (respectively
O-CommitSig) messages and invoke the ThreshSign subsystem to
aggregate the signature shares in the commit messages into a single
signature. The aggregated signatures are sent via the corresponding
D-Commit and O-Commit messages.

Replicas receive the valid O-Commit and D-Commit messages,
commit the command, and mark it for execution. After executing
the command at the global order number j, each replica signs the
resulting state and sends a signed ExecSig message to the execution
collector. The execution messages are signed using a ThreshSign
instance that is different from the ones used during commit. This
ThreshSign instance does not require trust and is kept outside of the
trusted subsystem. The execution collector 𝑅0 collects at least 𝑓 + 1
valid ExecSig messages, aggregates the signatures into a single
ExecProof message, and sends the message to all the replicas. It also
sends this message to the client along with the result of execution.
The client verifies the signature, accepts the result, and returns.

5 EVALUATION
We implemented multiple protocols under DQBFT and evaluated
them against state-of-the-art single-primary and multi-primary
protocols. Our evaluation answers the following questions:

(1) What is the impact of batching on protocol performance?
(2) How well do the protocols scale their performance when
increasing the system size from 10s to 100s of replicas in a
geo-distributed deployment?

(3) What is performance impact under replica failures?
(4) How do the DQBFT protocols compare to other multi-primary

protocols?

5.1 Protocols under test
Our evaluation includes the following state-of-the-art protocols.

Single-primary protocols. We evaluate PBFT [19], Hybster [14], and
SBFT [26]. We use the variant of PBFT that uses MACs that are
computationally cheaper than signatures. SBFT uses linear commu-
nication and 3𝑓 +𝑐 +1 fast-path quorum with 3𝑓 +2𝑐 +1 replicas. We
set 𝑐 to zero, because increasing 𝑐 does not improve fault tolerance.
Chained Hotstuff [58] is a rotating-primary protocol.

Multi-primary protocols. Prime [6] allows individual replicas to
disseminate commands using Reliable Broadcast, and a primary
provides an ordering for the disseminated commands periodically.
Dispel [57] uses Reliable Broadcast to disseminate commands, and
uses multiple instances of leaderless binary consensus to order the
commands. MirBFT [50] allows multiple replicas to act as primaries
concurrently by distributing sequence numbers evenly. It uses the
notion of an epoch to define which replicas can be primaries during

Balaji Arun and Binoy Ravindran

a certain period. RCC [30] allows multiple replicas to act as pri-
maries and uses the notion of rounds to facilitate a global execution
order. In each round, one command is committed by each of the
primaries and a deterministic execution order is decided.

DQBFT protocols. DQPBFT, DQSBFT, and DQHybster are DQBFT
instantiations of the original protocols PBFT, SBFT, and Hybster,
respectively. We also evaluated Linear Hybster and Destiny.

We implemented all the protocols in a common framework in
Golang. The framework uses gRPC [3] for communication and
protobuf [28] for message serialization. The ECDSA [34] algo-
rithms were used for authenticating the messages exchanged by
the clients and the replicas. We favored our own implementations
over the author versions for a fair and consistent evaluation. For
instance, the authors’ version of Hotstuff only disseminates com-
mand hashes [50], but all our implementations disseminate actual
payloads. In addition, the source code for RCC and Hybster were
not publicly available. The trusted components were implemented
in C++ using the Intel SGX SDK [23]. Our implementations of BFT
protocols perform out-of-order processing of commands, except
Hotstuff, which does not support out-of-order processing because
it rotates the primary’s role regularly. For Hybrid protocols, out-of-
order processing is limited due to the use of counter-based trusted
components. Creation of signatures using the trusted components
happen in order, whereas all other message processing happens
out-of-order.

5.2 Experimental Setup
We used SGX-enabled virtual machines (VMs) available on Mi-
crosoft’s Azure [45] platform. We obtained VMs from ten different
datacenter regions: six in North America, three in Europe, and one
in South East Asia. The protocols were deployed in each of these
regions leveraging multiple VMs. The number of VMs depends on
the experiment. Each VM consists of 8 vCPUs and 32GB of memory
(best available at the time of experiments). The VMs were part of a
Kubernetes [27] cluster and the protocol replicas and clients were
deployed as pods. We placed one replica pod per VM and placed
the clients on different VMs. We designated a replica in Eastern US
to serve the primary’s role. The network latencies between regions
are in [1]. The bandwidth between replicas ranged from 400 Mb/s
(between US and Asia) and 6 Gb/s (within same region).

We carried out experiments for five different values of 𝑁 (the
number of replicas): 19, 49, 97, 193, 301 tolerating 6, 16, 32, 64,
100 BFT and 9, 24, 48, 96, 150 Hybrid failures, respectively. For
each experiment, replicas were evenly spread among the ten re-
gions. Clients send requests in a closed-loop, meaning they wait
for the result of the previous request before sending the next one.
Unless otherwise stated, clients are evenly spread across all the
region and send commands to their local replicas for multi-primary
protocols and to the primary for single-primary protocols. Our per-
formance numbers account for both the consensus and execution
time. We use Prometheus [56] timeseries database to collect metrics
from the replicas periodically and report our results. The state is a

5.3 Experiments
5.3.1 Batching Experiment. First, we measured the impact of batch-
ing commands on protocol performance. Increasing the batch size
increases the size of the initial phase message multicasted by the
primary (or the coordinator in the case of DQBFT). For this experi-
ment, we deployed 𝑁 = 97 replicas, increased the batch size from
10 to 1200 commands per batch, and measured the performance.
Figure 7 shows the results. The single-primary protocols reach their
maximum throughput at batch size of 100, as their primaries’ are
saturated. Hybster’s performance is limited because it performs
in-order attestation of messages including those with command
payloads by copying them into the trusted component hosted inside
the enclave. In contrast, linear communication complexity and the
use of threshold signatures in Linear Hybster pays off as only the
command hash is copied to the enclave enabling it to perform at par
with PBFT that uses cheaper message authentication codes (MAC).
Moreover, threshold signatures also help SBFT and Linear Hyb-
ster scale better at large batch sizes than MAC. Chained Hotstuff’s
throughput is significantly limited because it rotates the primary for
each command that disallows out-of-order processing of multiple
batches simultaneously. Thus, its latency is higher because each
replica must wait for 96 other replicas to propose before its turn.

The multi-primary protocols show multifold increase in through-
put compared to single-primary protocols by virtue of allowing
multiple replicas to propose simultaneously. RCC, MirBFT, and
DQPBFT perform similarly because under non-faulty scenarios
their effective behaviors are the same. Note that RCC is also a BFT
paradigm and can also be instantiated with SBFT; we observed that

Destiny’s performance exceeds all other protocols
with 35% better throughput than the next best protocol DQSBFT
and 40% lower latency than other multi-primary protocols. Destiny
performs better because aggregating 𝑓 + 1 signature shares is com-
putationally cheaper than aggregating 3𝑓 + 1 shares [52], and the
𝑓 + 1 quorum gives 𝑓 additional replicas to provide redundancy
from slow nodes and staggering network, unlike SBFT. Note that
this experiment also serves to demonstrate the impact of increasing
the command size because the execution overheads are small for
our key-value store. For instance, a command payload of 1024 bytes
and 200 batch size will have similar performance to a command
payload of 512 bytes and 400 batch size.

Scalability Experiment. Second, we measured the perfor-
5.3.2
mances of the protocols while increasing the system size, i.e., the
number of replicas, from 19 to 301 replicas. Figure 8 shows the
results. Similar to the previous experiment, the performance of
single-primary protocols is limited by their primaries’ bandwidth.
Thus, their performances decrease with increasing 𝑁 since the pri-
maries must send the initial payload (≈ 100𝑘𝐵) to all the replicas.
On the other hand, multi-primary protocols have a higher peak
throughput than single-primary protocols by virtue of enabling
multiple replicas to send the initial payload that distributes the
bandwidth requirements among all replicas. As with the batching
experiment, the performance trends for RCC, MirBFT, and DQPBFT
are similar. Destiny’s throughput scales better than all other proto-
cols. At 301 replicas, Destiny’s provides 40% better throughput and
70% lower latency than the next best protocol DQSBFT.

We also analyzed the CPU utilization and network traffic at
𝑁 = 97. For single-primary protocols, the primaries reached peak
traffic of 6Gbps at CPU usage between 50%-65%, while the repli-
cas bandwidth was ≈115Mbps with 10%-20% CPU utilization. For
DQBFT protocols, the average replica traffic was ≈1.5Gbps and CPU
usage was 65%. Destiny reached peak CPU usage of 95% indicating
that the other DQBFT protocols were limited by their bandwidth
(inline with Figure 3).

Scalability under Failures. Third, we measured the proto-
5.3.3
col performance under failures. For this purpose, we repeated the
scalability experiment with 𝑓 failed replicas. Failed replicas are
equally spread between the ten regions similar to the deployment
spread. Figure 9 shows the results. Note that SBFT, DQSBFT, and
Destiny are more negatively impacted by the failure of 𝑓 replicas
than 𝐷𝑄𝑃𝐵𝐹𝑇 , RCC, and MirBFT. Both SBFT and 𝐷𝑄𝑆𝐵𝐹𝑇 must
fallback to the slow path by default since they lack the fast quorum,
which is equal to the system size. This adds additional communica-
tion steps to the SBFT protocols. Thus, the performance of DQSBFT
is poor and not any better than DQPBFT. On the other hand, Des-
tiny must wait for replies from all the regions instead of only from a
majority of regions, because the majority of regions do not have the
majority quorum due to failures. Yet, Destiny performs better than
others at 193 and 301 replicas because its linear communication
pays off at that scale.

Note that due to the reduction in the number of replicas that
participate in a given round, Dispel’s latency under failures is sub-
stantially lower than that during the failure-free case. Similarly,
for other multi-primary protocols, we observe lower latencies than

with failure-free experiments. We attribute this to the reduction in
number of messages that are sent and processed by each replica.

Single Replica Failure Experiments. Although the previous
5.3.4
experiments show that Destiny performs better than state-of-the-
art multi-primary protocols such as RCC, the DQBFT protocols
(DQSBFT and DQPBFT) perform only at par with the RCC paradigm
protocols. In the previous experiments, we balanced the clients
equally on all the regions and ensured that the replicas receive
requests from the clients at the same rate. However, in practice,
it may not be feasible to ensure a uniform request rate among
replicas, because certain regions may have more load than others,
e.g., due to geographical characteristics such as different time zones,
or even Byzantine behaviors. Therefore, we devised an experiment
to compare the performance of DQPBFT with other multi-primary
protocols, RCC and MirBFT, when different replicas receive requests
at different rates.

For this experiment, we deployed 97 replicas that are spread
among the ten regions, and increased the number of clients non-
uniformly over time. Figure 10 shows the results. Initially, at 𝑡 = 0,
clients are spread evenly among the replicas, during which all three
protocols, namely, RCC, DQPBFT, and MirBFT, perform similarly
as their behavior is effectively the same under these conditions.
At 𝑡 = 50, we double the number of clients in all regions except
in one region, namely South East Asia. Following the increase, at
𝑡 = 60, as the replicas are overwhelmed by the sudden increase in
requests from the new clients, they lose throughput slightly for
some time before bouncing back. As the system stabilizes, it can be
observed that DQPBFT’s throughput increases by 25% while that
of RCC and MirBFT remain the same as before. The O-instance of
the DQBFT paradigm enables each replica to deliver commands at
its own pace without depending on other replicas’ deliveries. In
contrast, the round-robin approach to delivery used by MirBFT and
RCC throttles all the replicas to deliver commands at the rate of
the slowest replica.

When a replica becomes faulty, all three protocols cease to deliver
client requests because the undelivered commands from the faulty
replica must be delivered. Figure 10 shows this effect at 𝑡 = 140,
when one replica is killed. All three protocols cease to deliver com-
mands as they begin their view change procedures for the failed
replica. Once the view change completes, throughput is restored.

6 RELATED WORK
Numerous performance-oriented single-primary BFT protocols [11,
19, 26, 36, 55] have been proposed in literature. In Section 2.3, we
discussed the limitations of primary-based, the rotating-leader [53,
54, 58] and dependency-based ordering [9, 29] approaches.

Request dissemination [6, 21, 22, 32] has been proposed as a
means to relieve primary’s workload. These solutions use Reliable
Broadcast that increases the overall latency since replication must
always precede ordering due to lack of Agreement property and
incurs quadratic communication.

The idea of separating replication and global ordering has been
explored in the crash fault model [12, 39, 60]. SDPaxos [60] sepa-
rates replication from ordering, and uses a consensus protocol for
both the tasks. DQBFT’s separation technique can be viewed as
the BFT counterpart, but our design is optimized for scalability to
hundreds of replicas, while SDPaxos focuses on minimizing latency
in up to five-replica deployments. Furthermore, distributed log
protocols (e.g. Corfu [12]) use a benign sequencing node to dictate
global order. To prevent malicious sequencers from violating consis-
tency, the O-instance in DQBFT must assign sequence numbers by
reaching BFT consensus. Moreover, the interaction between D- and
O- instances must ensure that none of the instances compromise
the safety/liveness properties of each other. NoPaxos [39] requires
special network devices, thus is suitable only within a datacenter.
Various trusted component designs have been proposed previ-
ously for Hybrid protocols [14, 20, 35, 55]. The trusted counter de-
sign is simple and memory-efficient compared to log-based designs.
Among the known Hybrid protocols, we chose Hybster because the
protocol’s is designed specifically for commodity processors with
trusted subsystems such as Intel SGX. Threshold secret shares can
be used in place of threshold signatures [41], but requires creating
a set of secret key shares for each command and exposing it when
committing each command. This requires additional computational
and network resources. PoET [4] uses the trusted component to
dictate the minimum time period between block proposals, thus
adopting the synchrony timing model.

Alternate (e.g. XFT [42]) and mixed fault models (e.g. Hierar-
chical [7, 31]) have been proposed to improve performance in geo-
distributed systems. XFT assumes synchronous communication
among majority replicas for safety, while the Hybrid protocols as-
sumes the trusted component for safety. Unlike mixed fault models,
it tolerates 𝑓 global failures and has no limits on regional failures.

7 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we show that DQBFT is an effective paradigm for
designing highly scalable BFT protocols. Furthermore, with Destiny,
we show that linear communication and smaller quorums elevate
the performance of DQBFT protocols.
