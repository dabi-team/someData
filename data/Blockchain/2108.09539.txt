SAI-BA-IoMT: Secure AI-Based Blockchain-Assisted 
Internet of Medical Things Tool to Moderate the Outbreak 
of COVID-19 Crisis 

Mahender Kumar1, Ruby Rani2 

Abstract: Recently, an infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been reported in Wuhan, China, and subsequently 
spread worldwide within a couple of months. On May 16, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected several countries in the world.  In this 
article, we present how the amalgamation of blockchain, cryptography, internet of medical things  (IoMT), and artificial  intelligence (AI) 
technologies can address such an issue in the event of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we propose a secure AI-based blockchain-assisted 
IoMT (SAI-BA-IoMT) model for the healthcare system in the COVID-19 crisis.  The paper also examines the post-corona crisis that the 
world could be experienced after the pandemic. Additionally, we  exhibit the potential applications of the proposed model to resolve the 
difficulties originated from coronavirus.

Introduction 

1 
Nowadays,  the  entire  world  is  confronting  a  critical  health 
crisis  due  to  a  biological  attack,  COrono  VIrus  Disease 
(COVID-19)  [1].  It  is  a  kind  of  respiratory  disease  whose 
impact  will  seemingly  be  more  distinguishable  than  that  of 
the existing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), held 
in  2003.  Several  countries  are  extrapolating  the  infected-
control and public-health measures to control the pandemic. 
A  large  number  of  potentially  infected  people  have  been 
isolated (quarantined), and countries have been locked down 
to  overcome  the  unexpected  outbreak  of  coronavirus 
diseases.  Although  these  approaches  are  partially  practical 
since lockdown has affected the economy of many countries. 
Besides, it is well-known that the outbreak of COVID-19 in 
many countries such as  Italy, the  USA, and Span, has been 
brutally  affected  their  medical  instructions  also,  where  the 
case of infected patients overwhelmed the hospitals  [2].   

Due to COVID-19, the world is currently suffering from 
severe problems such as the shortage of hospitals and medical 
staff, global economic loss, post-corona disease, and security 
and privacy of patient information. To tackle the problems as 
mentioned above,  we are exploring  four emerging potential 
technologies:  blockchain  [3],  Internet  of  Medical  Things 
(IoMT)  [4], Artificial  intelligence  [5],  [6],  and  lightweight 
cryptosystem  [7].  Our  focus  is  to  employ  such  digital

and 

technologies, help the people in moderating the outbreak of 
pandemics.  Amalgamating  blockchain 
artificial 
intelligence  (AI)  with  healthcare  covers  a  diverse  area  of 
healthcare  services,  in  which  wireless  body  area  network 
(WBAN)  is  an  essential  part  of  the  perspective  of  IoT 
application.  Recently,  Chang  et  al.  [7]  discussed  some 
security attacks associated with COVID-19, such as a record 
of  infected  people,  donation  transparency,  spreading  false 
information,  and  social  distancing,  where  blockchain  can 
solve to address such security  attacks.  Here,  we observed a 
smart monitoring system that can help peoples to reduce the 
outbreak  of  COVID-19  pandemic.  Inspired  by  this  idea,  in 
this  paper,  we  present  a  smart  mounting  system  that 
integrates the blockchain, AI, lightweight cryptosystem, and 
Internet  of  Medical  things  to  addresses  the  problem 
associated with COVID-19. 

In the following, the background, including the brief of 
novel emerging technologies, will be discussed in Section 2. 
We  will  analyze  the  COVID-19  crisis  and  discuss  the 
problems  that  currently  world  has  been  facing  due  to  the 
COVID-19 
the 
amalgamated  technology  that  we  have  been  proposed.  The 
recent  impact  technologies  in  the  current  crisis  and  their 
solutions are explained in Section 5. The paper concludes in 
Section 6.

2  Background 

Here,  we  discuss  the  recent  emerging  technologies  that  we 
are  focusing  in  order  to  address  the  issue  associated  to  the 
COVID-19 

 
 
 
Internet  of  Medical  Things.  The  IoMT,  in  healthcare, 
connects several wearable or implanted sensors (have limited 
computational power and storage data) on the patient’s body 
that continuously senses and sends data to the personal server 
(smartphone) [8]. The personal server collects data from each 
sensor  and  helps  the  WBAN  for  transmitting  data  to  the 
medical  server  via  the  internet.  After  receiving  data,  the 
medical  server  processes  and  stores  it  and  suggests  an 
appropriate  physician  based  on  the  severity  of  the  patient. 
The medical server is a central database that may inevitably 
result in more significant damage if the system is exposed to 
a hacking attack. To address this issue, we adopt blockchain 
(a  public  ledger  of  transactions),  provides  a  decentralized 
database of records, and share data among each participate. 

Blockchain.  Blockchain  is  a  chain  of  blocks  linked  to  the 
previous  one  using  cryptographic  hash  and  has  a  set  of 
immutable  transactions  [9].  Each  transaction  is  verified  by 
the consensus protocol (Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake 
(PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)) of a 
majority of the participants in the network. Once the data is 
stored,  it  can  never  be  modified/deleted,  and  so  easily 
tracked.  One  of  the  most  famous  examples  in  practice  that 
uses  blockchain 
the  cryptocurrency,  Bitcoin  [10]. 
Blockchain has a wide range of applications in several areas, 
including  peer-to-peer  insurance,  online  voting,  smart 
contracts, and its adoption in the health care system is also 
being  discussed.  Since  the  sensor  and  medical  server  have 
different  computational  power  and  storage  space,  it  is  also 
challenging to ensure the security and privacy of data in such 
a lightweight environment.

key 

private 

Public key cryptosystem. Public key cryptosystem holds two 
public 
(decryption/signature) 
keys: 
(encryption/verification) key. A private key is kept secret to 
the  user,  and  publically  key  is  publically  broadcast  to  the 
available receipt in the system. Both keys are mathematically 
linked  in  such  a  way  that  it  is  negligible  to  compute  the 
private  key  on  the  given  public.  In  such  a  cryptosystem,  a 
private  key  is  responsible  for  ensuring  authenticity,  non-
repudiation, and authorization, while the public key ensures 
the confidentiality and integrity of data. There have discussed 
several examples of public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA, 
ElGamal,  and  identity-based  crypto  stem  (IBC)  that  are 
implemented  on  the  distinct  mathematical  tool,  such  as 
modular  exponentiation,  elliptic  curve,  and  bilinear  pairing 
[11].  In  the  proposed  technology,  we  are  adopting  IBC 
implemented on the elliptic curve as a cryptosystem to secure 
transactions  during  communication.  It  is  considered  as  the 
lightweight cryptosystem for IoT [12].   

Artificial  Intelligence.  Besides,  we  believed  that  detecting 
diseases at an early stage can enable us to overcome and treat 

them  appropriately.  In  this  direction,  we  introduced  a 
Diagnosis Expert System (DES) instead of a medical server 
[13], [5]. In the proposed work, the diagnosis expert system 
is an artificial intelligence-based computer system that has a 
decision-making ability as similar to a human expert, which 
fetches  the  data  from  the  blockchain  and  identifies  the 
treatment  accurately  depends  on  the  method  that  is  used  in 
diagnosing the diseases. 

We  are  amalgamating  these  emerging  technologies  to 
present  a  state-of-the-art  smart,  automated  monitoring 
healthcare  system,  in  which  IoMT  is  responsible  for 
providing  a network to collect patient data from the patient 
and  recommending  a  prescription  suggested  by  diagnosis 
expert system. We  will adopt a lightweight cryptosystem to 
ensure  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  and  authenticity  of 
medical data during each transaction. 

3  Outbreak of COVID-19: Analysis 

In  late  2019,  the  first  case  of  the  corona  has  been  seen  in 
Wuhan, China. It had been circulating within the population 
since January and has been spread globally at an exponential 
rate.  On  March  11,  2020,  COVID-19  had  affected  around 
118,000 people in 114 countries, and 4291 people have lost 
their lives. Accordingly, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a 
pandemic [14]. After China, Italy became the second hotspot 
of  most  significant  infected  cases  COVID-19,  with  a  very 
high fatality rate of 7.2% (1625 deaths/22512 cases), which 
was  substantially  higher  on  comparing  in  China  (2.3%)  on 
March 17, 2020 [15].  
On  March  27,  2020,  the  USA  was  the  first  to  reach  the 
100,000 cases, which is double in the next five days and reach 
1 million with a 5.8% fatality rate in the next 31 days  [16]. 
As of May 16, 2020, coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), 
has  been  infected  to  around  4.3  million  people  worldwide, 
carrying a fatality rate of around 7.04%, as shown in Table 1 
and  Fig.  1.  Currently,  the  US  has  the  highest  number  of 
infected  cases  (1,522,149),  which  is  31.85%  of  total  cases 
worldwide, with a 5.96% fatality rate, shown in Fig. 2.  

Fig. 3 and Table 1 show that the period from March 12-
April  3,  2020,  was  the  transition  period  where  the  newly 
infected cases were linearly increasing. There can be seen a 
constant  growth  of  newly  infected  cases  (around  800,000) 
from April 13, 2020. The fatality rate has been increased from 
1.67%  to  7.18%  since  April  27,  2020.  There  is  a  0.24% 
decline of fatality rate from April 27, 2020, to May 16, 2020, 
as  illustrated  in  Table  1.  Fig.  4  and  Table  1  show  that  the 
recovered patients' cured rate, where we can see that graph is 
fortunately linearly increasing.

Over four  months into 2020, the world is encountering 
an  extremely  health  crisis:  the  outbreak  of  a  respiratory 
disease-coronavirus (COVID-19). The impact of COVID-19 
will  probably  be  higher  than  that  of  the  severe  acute 
respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  in  2003.  Many  countries 
tackled this new kind of crisis by extrapolating the traditional 
infected-control  and  public-health  measures  to  control  the 
COVID-19  pandemic.  It  ranges  from  extreme  quarantine 
measure (e.g., in China and India) to painstakingly detailed 
contact tracing with thousands of contact tracers (e.g., South 
Korea  and  Singapore)  [1].  Currently,  a  large  number  of 
potentially infected people need to be isolated (quarantined) 
in order to overcome the unexpected outbreak of coronavirus 
diseases  [2].  Such  approaches  could  not  be  practical  to 
moderate  the  COVID-19  outbreak  while  the  economy  of 
many countries has been affected due to lockdown. Could a 
new digital technology be helped the system for COVID-19? 
There should be an urgent need for an effective way. In this 
direction,  we  explore  four  potential  applications  of  digital 
technologies  in  order  to  augment  a  strategy  for  tackling 
COVID-19:  blockchain,  AI,  public-key  cryptosystem,  and 
the  Internet  of  Medical  Things.  Now,  we  present  some 
problems related to the COVID-19 crisis. 
1.  Post-corona  diseases.  Recently, 

researchers  have 
uncovered the post-corona situation that will be worst for 
the patient who has been once infected from viruses. The 
people  who  recovered  from 
the  virus  are  more 
susceptible  to  diseases,  like  Heart  attack,  High  BP, 
respiratory disease, and diabetes.  

2.  Lack  of  medical  resources.  Secondly,  many  countries 
have been lacking in medical equipment, hospitals, and 
medical staff due to the outbreak of COVID-19.  

3.  Destructed  global  economic.  However,  they  locked 
down  the  whole  country  to  overcome  this  difficult 
situation, but it came  with the countries' financial loss. 

Thus,  the  third  issue  associated  with  COVID-19  is  the 
destruction of the global economy.  

4.  Privacy  of  Patient’  information.  Each  participant, 
including  patient  and  hospital,  is  concerned  about  the 
privacy of patient information, including identity, health 
data, suggested physician, type of treatment. 

4  Proposed model for COVID-19 crisis 
Here, we present the architecture of the proposed secure AI-
based Blockchain-assisted IoMT (SAI-BA-IoMT) model for 
health  care  system  in  COVID-19,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.  It 
consists of six entities: user, sensor, personal digital assistant 
(PDA), blockchain, permissioned agent, medical server, and 
diagnose the expert system.  
A user can  be  a  patient  who  is  suffering  from  a  virus  or  a 
person who has recovered from a virus. He implants or wears 
the set of sensors in his body in order to collect the medical 
data.  Along  with  this,  the  user  also  has  a personal  digital  
assistant (PDA),  such  as  a  smartphone  that  collects  the 
medical data from each sensor and stores in its storage. User 
can visually monitor his health status from PDA, encrypts it 
and periodically uploads it in blockchain in the form of block 
via the internet. Here, we consider each communication as a 
transaction  that  includes  the  medical  data,  timestamp,  and 
information of the previous block.  

There are two kinds of permissioned agents: validating 
agent  and  recording  agent.  The validating  agents (VA)  are 
the group of nodes responsible for validating the transaction. 
The  only  transaction  validated  through  the  majority  of 
validating agents is eligible to store in the blockchain. After 
validating, the recording agents store the data in the form of 
block and allows only those participating in the network to 
access who has permission. 

 
Figure 5. Architecture of proposed secure AI-based blockchain-enabled-IoMT model 

In  the  proposed  model,  each  participant,  including 
medical  staff,  hospital,  diagnosis  expert  system,  manage  a 
ledger  for  each  block  in  the  network.  A diagnosis  expert 
system is  an  AI-based  computer  system  with  a  decision-
making ability similar to a human  expert.  The DES fetches 
the data from the blockchain, decrypts it, and processes it to 
identify the type of diseases. It also suggests the prescription 
to a patient, physician if necessary, or command the sensors 
on  the  patient’s  body  remotely,  if  the  patient  is  in  severe 
condition. This completes the brief of our proposed model. 

5  Advantages of proposed SAI-BA-IoMT 

model in COVID-19 

Lack of medical resources  

Here, we discuss how our proposed model can assist people, 
medical  institution  and  country  to  handle  the  event  of 
COVID-19 crisis.  
5.1 
Many countries have been brutally affected by the COVID-
19 outbreak. Due to a lack of hospitals, medical equipment, 
and  medical  professionals.  They  have  unable  to  diagnose 
every infected patient in their country, so many people have 
died  due  to  a  lack  of  hospitals  and  doctors.  The  proposed 
model can resolve such a crisis by monitoring and diagnosing 
hundreds  and  thousands  of  patients  simultaneously.  IoMT 
technology is responsibility is to collect data between patients 
and  hospitals.  Blockchain  manages  the  patient’s  medical 
record  and  provides  a  distributed  database.  The  public  key 
cryptosystem  ensures  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  and 
authenticity of data. AI is responsible for suggesting the type 
of physician, predicting kind of disease, and recommending 
the prescription based on the patient’s medical record. 

5.2  Decentralized database 
The  proposed  SAI-BA-IoMT  model  adopts  blockchain 
technology to eliminate the central database.  In the existing 
medical system, the medical report needs to be going through 
many  levels  to  reach  the  hospital,  which  takes  a  couple  of 
days to verify and treatment. On the other side, the proposed 
model's  database  is  distributed  and  accessible  to  those 
authorized participants who have permission to  manage the 
ledger.  There  is  no  need  for  such  a  level  of  validation,  and 
hence,  the  response  time  to  diagnose  a  patient  became 
significantly  efficient.  Secondly,  since  the  database  is 
distributed, there is less risk of data loss due to a single point 
failure attack. Third, since each participant has ledger in its 
storage,  the  proposed  model  does  not  require  a  central 
database to be online all time. 

Privacy of Patient information 

5.3 
lightweight  public-key 
The  proposed  model  uses  a 
cryptosystem,  especially  an  identity-based  cryptosystem 
implemented on the elliptic curve cryptosystem, to preserve 
the privacy of patient information. The IBC does not require 
to  verify  the  recipient’s  public  key.  The  ECC-based 
arithmetical operations are around 20 times faster, in terms of 
computational overhead than  modular exponentiation. Also, 
the 128-bit ECC key has the same security level as a 1024-bit 
RSA key. The integration of unique features of IBC and ECC 
makes them suitable for IoT applications. 

Share economy 

5.4 
According to the department of economic and social affairs, 
the UN, the global supply chain, and international trade have 
been disrupted. The World Bank and credit- rating agencies 
have  downgraded.  As  per  the  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF),  the  global  economy  is  expected  to  down  by  over  3 

 
percent  in  2020.  Due  to  COVID-19,  the  global  economy 
could  lose  worth  up  to  $8.8  trillion.  In  this  respect,  our 
proposed  SAI-BA-IoMT  model  can  be  exploited  to  create 
decentralized,  shared  economy  application  that  enables 
people  to  monetize  their  product  (service)  to  create  more 
wealth [17]. To address such problem, IoMT will acts as IoT 
to  connect  various  products,  blockchain  managed  the  data, 
and AI-based medical expert system acts as an expert system.

the patient's health situation regularly who have infected from 
viruses previously. If needed, the proposed system diagnose 
them.   

6  Conclusion 
This  paper  analyzed  the  impact  of  new  infectious  disease, 
COVID-19,  on  the  entire  world.  We  observed  that  many 
countries,  such  as  the  USA,  Italy,  and  China,  have  been 
brutally  affected  through  such  pandemic.  In  this  paper,  we 
have  addressed  the  four  major  problems  associated  with 
COVID-19:  the  deficiency  of  medical  hospitals  and  staff, 
post-corona  disorders,  global  economy,  and  privacy  of 
the 
patient 
amalgamation  of  blockchain, 
artificial 
intelligence  technologies  can  address  such  an  issue  in  the 
event of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we show how the 
suggested  technology  can  defeat  the  problems  associated 
with the disease.
