ABSTRACT 

Non-fungible  tokens  or  NFTs  are  the  digital  assets  on  a 
blockchain.  NFTs  are  unique  and  they  cannot  be  divided  like 
cryptocurrencies.  NFTs  could  store  digital  ownership  of 
artwork or collections or can be fan tokens or tickets for clubs. 
NFTs are based on a smart contract on a blockchain network 
which supports them such as Ethereum, Cardano, or Polkadot. 
Most  of  the  NFTs  are  now  minted  on  Ethereum  (ERC-20) 
network but it has some main issues like high transaction fees 
and  low  speed.  There  are  lots  of  domains  which  can  be 
benefited  from  NFT  technology  such  as  art,  music,  gaming, 
sport, and wildlife conservation. NFTs could also be bought or 
sold  on  many  NFT  marketplaces  such  as  Opensea  and  Chiliz. 
The  trend  is  in  huge  hype  because  the  market  cap  and 
popularity of NFTs are growing significantly.

1    Introduction 
NFTs are now one of the important parts of a blockchain and 
decentralized  technology  that  are  trending  in  many  different 
industries in the world. NFTs are implemented on blockchain 
networks.  
NFT  was  firstly  proposed  in  Ethereum  blockchain  (EIP-721) 
and it is derived by  smart contracts of Ethereum. NFTs differ 
from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. NFTs are non-fungible and 
unique  tokens  that  cannot  be  divided  like  digital  coins.  NFTs 
represent  the  existence  and  ownership  of  digital  assets  such 
as videos, images, tickets, artworks, etc [23]. 
The first idea of NFTs originated from “Colored Coins” in 2012 
by  Yoni  Assia.  Colored  Coins  or  Bitcoin  2.x  are  unique  and 
identifiable  units  of  a  Bitcoin  that  can  be  small  as  a  single 
Satoshi  (0.00000001  BTC).  Colored  Coins’  transactions  are 
identifiable  from  regular  bitcoin  transactions  and  they  can 
represent  a  multitude  of  assets  and  have  multiple  use  cases 
[29]. 
There  are  lots  of  different  blockchain  networks  but  which  of 
them are suitable for implementing the NFTs? 
The  most  used  blockchain  network  that  now  supports  many 
NFT  projects  is  Ethereum.  Ethereum  can  also  provide  smart 
contracts  which  are  required  to  mint  NFTs.  But  Ethereum  is 

not the best in all aspects and it has several significant issues. 
We  analyze  the  challenges  and  issues  like  high  transaction 
fees  and  low  speed  that  are  the  main  problems  of  Ethereum 
blockchain.  This  leads  to  using  other  blockchain  networks  or 
the need to upgrade its protocols. But which other alternative 
blockchains are available and can be used for NFTs instead of 
Ethereum? 
There  are  several  alternative  blockchain  networks  which 
support  the  architecture  of  NFTs  like  Cardano,  Polkadot,  or 
Ethereum  2.0.  These  networks  could  solve  the  problems  of 
Ethereum  blockchain  and  they  can  be  new  alternative 
networks  or  competitors  for  Ethereum  in  the  future.  We 
compare them in several aspects like speed and fees. 
NFTs  have  useful  applications  in  technology  and  numerous 
domains  such  as  art,  sport,  music,  video  games,  or  even  wild 
conservation. Therefore, NFTs are being very popular amount 
people from outside of the technology like artists, gamers, DJs 
or  football  fans  could  make  a  great  future  and  huge  market 
cap for NFTs. 
In  this  paper,  we  first  introduce  basic  concepts  about 
blockchain  technology  and  the  general  definition  of  NFT. 
Then,  several  different  blockchain  networks  which  support 
NFTs  and  their  standards,  differences,  advantages,  and 
disadvantages  will  be  compared  and  introduced  in  detail. 
Next,  we  survey  briefly  the  smart  contracts  and  solidity 
important 
programming 
requirements  of  NFT’s  implementation.  Then,  we  answer  the 
question  “What  are  the  use  cases  of  NFTs?”.  In  addition, 
several  projects  for  each  domain  of  NFTs  are  introduced.  In 
the challenges part, we analyze the main issues and challenges 
of  the  NFTs  and  give  potential  solutions  to  tackle  the 
problems.  Finally,  we  discover  the  story  of  the  NFTs  market 
and  changes  in  the  last  few  years  and  whether  there  is  a 
correlation  between  the  market  price  of  cryptocurrencies 
such as Bitcoin and NFTs’ price.

2  Background 

Satoshi  Nakamoto  introduced  the  first  decentralized  peer-to-
peer electronic cash system and blockchain network [1]. Then, 
the  world  of  blockchain  and  decentralized  technologies  rose 
and  lots  of  other  new-generation  blockchain  networks  were 
implemented  with  new  technologies  in  speed,  consensus 
algorithm, and smart contract implementations. A blockchain 
is  the  heart  of  NFTs  technology  because  the  main  target  of 

 
NFTs  and  blockchain  technologies  is  to  implement  and  use  a 
decentralized  network  instead  of  traditional  basic  central 
ecosystems.

2.1 

 What is a blockchain 

cross-platform 

Blockchain  is  a  decentralized  network  that  is  initiated  by 
nodes that create a new “block” of data. A blockchain node is 
an  open-source, 
that  allows 
developers to create various services [28]. Blockchain uses an 
encryption  method  called  cryptography.  All  the  new  blocks 
are  broadcasted  to  every  party  over  the  network  in  an 
encrypted  form  and  they  are  signed  with  a  digital  signature 
called private key [10].

2.2 

 NFTs vs. fungible Tokens 

There are several main differences between NFT and fungible 
tokens.  Fungible  tokens  like  Bitcoin  and  fiat  currencies  are 
identical  or  uniform  and  can  be  interchanged  with  other 
fungible tokens of the same type without any issues. 

NFTs  have  two  major  differences  from  fungible  tokens.  NFTs 
cannot be divided or merged and they are unique. NFT stands 
for  representing  the  digital  ownership  of  digital  collections, 
artworks, or any other digital certification of ownership of any 
digital  asset  in  a  blockchain  network  [8].  The  first  NFT  was 
introduced  on  the  Ethereum  ERC-721  blockchain  in  2017.  In 
comparison  to  fungible  tokens,  NFTs  have  several  new  use 
cases such as representing game collectible items, fan tokens, 
and digital artworks [2]. 

3.1  Ethereum 

The  Ethereum  blockchain  is  the  second  biggest  blockchain 
network  and  also  supports  the  implementation  of  NFT. 
Ethereum  was  proposed  by  Vitalik  Buterin  in  2013  [5], 
because of the lack of smart contracts in Bitcoin’s blockchain 
network.  This  decentralized  programmable  blockchain 
provides  smart  contracts  which  are  used  by  lots  of  NFT 
projects. 

3.1.1  ERC standards 
Several  standards  are  accepted  on  the  Ethereum  blockchain 
for  different  use  cases.  The  tokens  are  implemented  in  the 
solidity programming language. 
ERC-20:  A  general  standard  for  tokens  which  is  mostly  used 
on  the  Ethereum  blockchain  with  basic  functionality  to 
transfer tokens through a smart contract. 
ERC-721: A common non-fungible standard that each token is 
a  unique  distinguishable  asset.  With  this  standard,  each  NFT 
has its ownership in a smart contract [3]. 
ERC-821:  Through  this  standard,  anyone  can  check  the 
address of the contract and find which features are supported. 
There are also  other standards for  NFTs on  blockchains such 
as NEO and EOS [4]. 
ERC-1155:  A  new  standard  that  supports  the  features  of 
fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC-721). It also 
supports converting and minting new tokens [21]. 

the  Ethereum  network 

3.1.2  Ethereum 2.0 
Ethereum  2.0  is  the  second  official  version  of  the  Ethereum 
network  which  solves  the  main  issues  of  current  Ethereum 
blockchain problems in several phases. 
The most important issue of the current Ethereum network is 
scalability.  There  are  a  high  number  of  decentralized 
that  process 
applications  of 
approximately  up to  20  transactions per second. It  leads  to  a 
lower  speed  and  higher  costs  in  the  Ethereum  network. 
Ethereum  2.0  will  allow  performing  a  thousand  transactions 
per second, to solve the scalability problem [17]. 
This network upgrade will also change the current consensus 
protocol.  It  transmits  the  current  proof-of-work  model  to 
proof-of-stake  which  makes  the  Ethereum  network  more 
energy 
environmentally 
consumption  [17].  Ethereum  2.0  is  already  launched  on  1 
December 2020 and the last phase will be launched probably 
in 2021.

3.2  Cardano 
Cardano  is  one  of  the  popular  developing  third-generation 
blockchain platforms which was started by Charles Hoskinson, 
the  former  co-founder  of  Ethereum  [9]  after  he  left  the 
Ethereum project in 2014. 
Cardano  is  open-source  and  has  several  advantages  against 
Ethereum  and  Bitcoin  such  as  higher  speed  and  lower 
transaction  fees.  It  supports  decentralized  applications  (so-
called “Dapps”) and smart contracts  that provide minting the 
NFTs.  Another  interesting  feature  of  the  Cardano  project  is 
that  it  is  one  of  the  first  blockchain  projects  which  is 
developed  and  designed  by  a  scientific  team  of  academics 
[10]. 
IOHK  company  was  one  of  the  important  developers  of  the 
Cardano project. IOHK has a team of  engineers and  scientists 
that builds cryptocurrencies and blockchains for corporations 
and academic institutions [14]. 
Cardano  uses  the  proof-of-stake  [PoS]  protocol  which  has 
several  advantages  over  the  proof-of-work  [PoW]  protocol 
used  by  blockchains  such  as  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum.  The 
advantages of PoS are security, more decentralization, energy, 
and cost efficiency [11]. 
Cardano  is  the  most  staked  network  in  the  world  with  about 
73%  of  all  the  network  coins  [12].  It  means  that  Cardano, 
Polkadot,  and  Ethereum  2.0  blockchains  have  the  most 
potential  capacities  to  become  the  future  of  blockchain 
technology as the staked values. 

3.3  Polkadot 
Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol that  unites 
and  connects  parachains,  a  network  of  heterogeneous 
blockchain shards through the Polkadot Relay Chain [16]. 
Polkadot is also  capable  of  supporting NFTs in its ecosystem. 
Polkadot  has  several advantages  over  the  Ethereum  network 
such  as  lower  transaction  fees  and  higher  speed.  Therefore, 
Polkadot  can  be  an  alternative  ecosystem  for  NFTs.  Polkadot 
has a wide range of partners and chains which are adopted to 
its technology [16].

4  Smart Contracts 
To  mint  or  trade  a  NFT on a  blockchain,  it  is  required  to  use 
smart  contracts.  As  a  technical  view,  “smart  contracts  are 
digital 
the 
decentralized  consensus  that  is  tamper-proof  and  typically 
self-enforcing through automated execution” [13].  
A smart contract includes several lines of code and it is a self-
executing  digital  contract  with  terms  of  the  agreement  that 
are stored in the blockchain.

 Solidity programming language 
4.1 
To implement smart contracts in blockchain, we should often 
use  Solidity  programming  language.  Solidity  is  a  high-level 
JavaScript-like  programming  language  that  is  mostly  used  to 
write  smart  contracts  on  many  blockchains  like  Ethereum.

The  Ethereum  platform  and  Solidity  are  evolving  rapidly  to 
avoid  bugs  and  security  risks  and  the  developers  should 
consider these developments. For example, the code compiled 
today may not be compiled a few months later [19]. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5  Use cases of NFTs 
There are several main domains of NFTs that have the biggest 
share  of  the  NFTs’  market.  The  most-traded  NFTs  are  in  the 
categories of art, collectible objects, and games collectibles by 
about 85% of total traded volume.  
There  are  also  new  trending  use  cases  of  NFTs  in  sports  like 
fan  tokens  that  are  being  popular  among  football  clubs  or  in 
other sports.   

5.2  Music 
Like art, the music industry is affected by NFT and blockchain 
technology. Every piece of music can be converted to a unique 
NFT. Singers or DJs can sell limited copies of any music which 
they produced. This use case of NFTs has several benefits for 
both  artists  and  their  fans.  The  NFTs  could  also  be  traded 
between  the  fans  and  they  can  become  financially  the 
stakeholders of the music industry.  

A. Parham et al. 

Figure 3: Composition of the NFT market. (a) Share of volume 
traded by category. (b) Share of transactions by category [18]. 

5.1  Artworks 
One  of  the  first  and  biggest  domains  of  NFTs  is  Artworks. 
Artists can create an NFT from their artworks and sell it as a 
digital asset or digital ownership on a blockchain network. As 
figure 3,  art is now the biggest share of the NFTs market cap 
and has an important role in the NFTs world.   
Art  NFTs  could  include  different  types  of  files  such  as  digital 
images,  gifs,  video  files,  or  other  intellectual  properties.  The 
artists  had  lots  of  challenges  to  display  their  works  and  get 
attention. They had to invest lots of money in advertisements 
or pay fees by traditional platforms.  Therefore, artists cannot 
sell their artworks as their real value of them. With the idea of 
NFTs,  the  artists  do  not  need  any  agents  to  certify  the 
ownership of any assets [23]. 
There  are  several  secure  NFT  marketplace  platforms  that 
artists can represent their artworks or sell them to any other 
person with a low fee. 

 Opensea 

5.1.2 
Opensea1 is  a  decentralized  marketplace  for  buying,  selling, 
and  trading  through  smart  contracts  on  the  Ethereum 
blockchain. The users store their items in their chosen wallet 
like  Metamask  wallet.  Opensea  allows  the  users  to  trade  not 
only  artworks  but  also  game  collections,  sport  NFTs,  domain 
names,  and  digital  collectibles by  only  a  2.5%  purchasing  fee 
that making it one of the most affordable platforms for NFTs. 

5.2.1  Audius 
Audius2 is a vast developing NFT project in the music industry 
and  it  is  known  as  Spotify  killer.  With  the  decentralized 
technology, the artists can earn more money from their works 
in  comparison  with  traditional  ways.  For  example,  only  12% 
of  the  whole  revenue  generated  in  the  music  industry  is 
earned  by  the  artists  in  2017.  The  main  aims  of  the  Audius 
project  are  transparency,  lack  of  laws,  and  in-time  payments 
to artists. It allows high-quality audio streaming for everyone 
in  a  decentralized  network.  The  Audius  protocol  is  based  on 
its token called $AUDIUS and is implemented on the Ethereum 
ecosystem [24]. 

Figure 4: Audius content lifecycle [24] 

Audius is well known as a rival against Spotify or Apple music 
streaming services. The decentralized technology of Audius is 
the  main  feature  that  could  compete  with  Spotify  and  Apple 
music in the future. 

 Game collections 

5.3 
The  game  industry  is  another  important  use  case  of  NFTs. 
There are a lot of game networks that have a pool of players. 
Players are directly connected and send data through a pool of 
proxies  regarding  their  states  in  the  game.  The  rules  of  the 
game are stored in the smart contracts based on the ERC-1155

Non-fungible tokens: Promise or Peril? 

smart  contract  by  the  creators  of  the  game.  Players  could 
receive  objects  in  the  game  and  these  objects  or  game 
collections  can  be  added  to  the  Ethereum  wallets  of  the 
players. These tokens can also be traded or attached to other 
tokens  based  on  the  ERC-1155  standard.  ERC-115  enables 
game  objects  and  multiple  tokens  to  be  included  in  a  single 
smart  contract.  All  of  the  transactions  of  the  players  are 
recorded on  the blockchain network. Gaming networks could 
be attacked or cheated, but a fail-proof monitoring mechanism 
can protect the network [21]. 

5.4  Fan Tokens 
One of the new interesting use cases of tokens in sport is fan 
tokens offering. Any fan of a sports club can buy a fan token of 
a certain club in an exchange by paying real money. Fan token 
is like a stock of a club and any fan can hold a small share of it. 
The  price  of  the  token  is  dependent  on  such  factors  as  the 
value,  profit,  or  the  popularity  of  a  club  which  changes  over 
time with any failure or success in that club [20]. 
The fans could also more get in touch with the club with their 
tokens.  For  instance,  any  token  owner  has  the  right  to  vote 
regarding  some  decisions  about  the  club.  This  leads  to  a 
deeper  connection  between  fans  and  the  clubs  because  the 
clubs  can  better  understand  the  taste  of  their  fans.  The  fan 
token offering is a win-win game for both of the fans and clubs 
and both can benefit from it [20]. 

from  high-ranked 

5.4.1  Chiliz 
The  Socios3 app  with  its  cryptocurrency  called  Chiliz4 ($CHZ) 
is the biggest platform based on fan tokens. Chiliz has a lot of 
partners 
football  clubs  such  as  FC 
Barcelona,  Juventus,  Paris  Saint-Germain,  and  Atletico  de 
Madrid.  Several other famous football clubs will  join it in the 
future.  The  Chiliz  market  is  growing  rapidly  and  fan  tokens 
are  more  popular  in  Asia,  where  crypto  technology  is  more 
popular and fan bases are growing [20]. 

5.5  Wildlife conservation 
NFTs have such interesting positive effects such as conserving 
wildlife. NFTs could store digital collection assets from lots of 
endangered animals and avoid extinction of wildlife and clone 
animals  for  tourism  by  implementing  the  crypto-wildlife.  For 
example, Cryptokitties5 is a blockchain-based collectible game 
through  the  idea  of  the  extensibility  of  NFTs.  Extensibility  is 
one of the special features of NFTs which make it possible that 

NFTs  could  be  combined  to  create  another  unique  NFT.  The 
extensibility  feature  of  NFTs  allows  making  revenue  to 
conserve the wildlife by  running campaigns  on the platforms 
such as Cryptokitties and Panda Earth [4].

 Challenges of NFTs 

6.1   Gas fee 
There  is  a  dynamic  fee  for  making  any  transactions  on  the 
Ethereum network called “gas fee”. 
The  gas  fee  is  received  by  the  miners  who  validate  the 
transactions on the blockchain. It is sent by the sender to  the 
address  of  the  miner  as  the  price  of  the  transaction.  It  is  a 
common method on many blockchains called “proof of work”. 
The Gas fee is measured by “gwei”. One gwei  is 0.000000001 
ETH  [6].  Gas  fee  prices  are  dynamic  and  it  depends  on  the 
congestion  of  the  network  and  the  price  of  Ethereum.  The 
lowest  gas  fee  price  is  usually  on  Weekends  when  the  gas 
prices are the lowest as the figure below shows.

5 https://www.cryptokitties.co/ 

Figure 5: Gas Price by Time of Day [7] 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ethereum dynamic gas fee price is an important challenge for 
NFTs  because  most  of  the  NFTs  are  minted on  the  Ethereum 
blockchain. This could be a big issue especially for cheap NFTs 
because  this  high  gas fee  price  is  not  affordable  for  them.  To 
tackle  this  problem  the  Cardano  or  Polkadot  blockchains  or 
Ethereum 2.0 version in the future would be a good choice for 
minting the NFTs. 

future, with rising new technologies for NFTs and blockchains 
like Cardano and Polkadot, it can be more important than now 
[23]. 
Blockchain  networks  have  usually  several  soft  forks  (minor 
modifications  that  are  compatible  forwards)  or  hard  forks 
(significant  modifications  that  may  conflict  with  previous 
protocols) updates during their developments and it can cause 
conflicts for NFTs [23]. 

A. Parham et al. 

6.2   51% attack 
One of the main risks of any blockchain network is that it can 
be attacked by attackers. 51% attack occurs when a group of 
miners controls more than 50% of the network’s mining hash 
rate  or  computing  power.    The  new  transactions  could  be 
prevented from confirmations or halted by the attackers [15]. 
More  powerful  blockchains  like  Bitcoin  does  not  likely  to  be 
suffering  from  51%  attack,  because  it  has  by  far  the  most 
decentralized nodes and a very high hash rate. Therefore, it is 
almost impossible  to  be attacked, because the attacker needs 
lots of resources and computing power to perform it.  
The  more  decentralized  a  blockchain  network  is,  the  lower 
chance  have  attackers  to  attack  it.  In  conclusion,  for  those 
blockchain  networks  like  Ethereum,  the  chance  of  being 
attacked is very low. 

 The market of NFTs 

7 
The NFTs’ market started with rapid growth in late 2017. The 
majority  of  the  market  was  dominated  by  the  art  category 
until  the  end  of  2018,  especially,  by  the  Cryptokitties 
collection. From January 2019, other categories started to gain 
popularity.  Then  it  remained  stable  until  mid-2020,  but  from 
July 2020, the market experienced a dramatic growth to about 
10 million US dollars daily volume in March 2021. It is about 
150 times more than 8 months before [18]. 
The  price  of  NFTs  has  almost  no  correlation  to  the 
cryptocurrency prices like Bitcoin because NFT markets might 
contain  multiple  asset  classes.  There  is  also  little  spillover 
between  different  NFT  markets  and 
is  unlike  the 
cryptocurrencies and stock market which have high spillover 
among each other as the research done by [26]. 

it 

Figure 6: a 51% attack example [27] 

In  figure  6,  the  corrupt  (red)  miner  has  a  higher  hashing 
power, therefore it can add new blocks to its private chain and 
can  broadcast  its  chain  to  the  rest  of  the  network  once  it  is 
longer (heavier) than the original chain [27]. 

6.3   Extensibility issues 
The  extensibility  feature  is  one  of  the  main  features  of  NFTs 
which  means  that  NFTs  can  be  combined  to  create  another 
unique NFT. 
The extensibility feature of NFTs is both an advantage and an 
issue.  The  extensibility  problem  is  dedicated  to  two  aspects, 
NFT interoperability, and updatable NFTs.  
Interoperability  or  cross-chain  means  that  the  existing  NFT 
ecosystems  are  isolated  from  each  other  and  NFTs  in  an 
ecosystem  can  only  trade  within  the  same  ecosystem  or 
network.  It  is  just  done  by  cross-chain  communications  from 
external  parties.  Now,  most  of  the  NFTs  are  implemented  on 
the  Ethereum  blockchain  and  there  are  no  challenges 
regarding  the  extensibility  for  most  of  the  NFTs.  But  in  the

 Conclusion 

8 
In this survey, we analyzed all the aspects of the NFTs such as 
architecture,  domains,  projects,  and  market  in  detail.  The 
main motivation of this paper was the huge hype of NFTs and 
blockchain technology which has interesting functions in lots 
of domains in the world.  
Most  of  the  NFT  projects  are  now  using  the  Ethereum 
ecosystem, but it can  change in  the  future because of its  lack
