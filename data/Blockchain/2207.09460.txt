The authors may own small numbers of the various tokens referenced in the text for
experimentation and/or investment purposes. At this time that is only sufﬁcient Ethereum
to operate a Web3 wallet, and Bitcoin locked on the Lightning network. No NFTs are
owned at this time. There are no ﬁnancial stakes in the development of any of these
ecosystems.

1. Introduction

1.1 Overview

Money is a social construct, like trust. Both are very important and ephemeral things, and
are being tested in a global digital world. We are a long way from the village structures in
which we evolved. We are now expected to casually adapt to the efﬁciencies promised by
teams working in global mixed reality. This chaotic and intangible mix of value, trust, and
socialisation is not well understood.

We wanted to explore exciting new developments in the transmission of value, and
trust, in ‘digital society’. The problem is that each of these topics alone are enormously
complex, and the intersections seem to be more so. We have been researching the current
state-of-the-art, and the emerging consensus narrative, to try to ﬁgure out how the collision
of these technologies might serve our virtual production workﬂows (Figure 1.1).

If at this stage you want to skip straight to the TL;DR for the whole book then

click this bold text.

Cybersecurity is top of the list of concerns in the EU digital society strategy, just ahead
of digital inclusion, so we started out with security best practices in mind, and we tried to
end the investigation with inclusion. We aim to support small and especially developing
companies in our sector, giving them a foot in the door on a global stage, without their
costs spiralling?

Fortunately, we discovered a wealth of carefully crafted open source tools which can
support this. We have tried to assemble them cogently, to deliver an open source kit
for experimentation, to curious technically minded SMEs, and we have applied our own
security knowledge on top of an already top class set of tools. It’s certainly not production
ready, but it’s good enough to commit small amounts of money into.

Whilst researching, it seemed that every door we opened was full of interesting and
useful treats. What was supposed to be a short technical paper quickly became a 200-
page book, and a deployable virtual machine stack, with a dozen different open source
components in it.

This book supports the software stack, which supports anyone who thinks this material
might be useful. Below is a précis of the chapters of the book, which will hopefully give
an insight into what “this stuff” is. The reader can decide to download the book and the

system “How To” guide. All of it is open source, all of it can be contributed to on GitHub,
all of it will be developed forward, and none of it is really ﬁnished yet.

Chapter 1 starts with an introduction to the book which is about value transmission,

with distributed trust, in global digital society and mixed reality systems.

Next is a summary of Web3, as it stands right now. Web3 is a complex term that is
cropping up far more in the technical press, so we wanted explain what it might mean.
Honestly, it’s still pretty confusing. There are a bunch of legacy explanations which are
Web3.0 (note the ‘0’ there), but these are withering on the vine. Then there’s the new VC
funded, super hyped, and potentially useless Web3 incarnations, which again cover a slew
of intersecting technologies. Note they dropped the zero to reboot the brand! This doesn’t
mean there’s nothing to see here. The astonishing amount of money and developer talent,
and the clear market hunger for things like NFTs (non-fungible tokens) suggest that there’s
a future for Web3, it’s just really unclear if this is inherently valuable or just hype.

In the next chapter we took a look at blockchain, which is very intersectional with

Web3. Even on its own this is a complex emergent set of disciplines.

The blockchain chapter was especially interesting to research. It turns out there’s a lot
of ways to get this technology wrong. Even very appealing options on paper, turn out to
have very shaky foundations. There are valuable things here, but given the complexity and
scope, we decided to focus on the most promising of the technology stacks; the Bitcoin
network.

Even Bitcoin isn’t just Bitcoin any more. It’s a swarm of open source tools which
can (in theory) accomplish a great many things. These newer, ancillary elements to
Bitcoin, are emergent right now. Some of them won’t be around until next year, and it’s
questionable whether they will even work out. With that said we aren’t convinced by the
value proposition of of Ethereum, and there’s enough Bitcoin tooling for us to cherry pick
useful components. We map those forward into our metaverse product.

The next chapter is about Money. In expanding our research on Bitcoin, we found that
it’s impossible to think about the tech without opening up a whole line of questions about
money itself. This is ﬁne because we set out to look at global value transfer for business.
It’s not a trivial subject though, and this section tries to overview why value and Bitcoin
are so enmeshed, then what other options there might be in the end (because Bitcoin has
kicked off a whole slew of global adoption outside of itself).

The distributed identity management, and trust chapter follows. Identity management
is important for digital society and potentially crucial to metaverse applications which
have a value transaction layer. It’s not an easy section to write about, because there’s a
lot of research, it’s not our ﬁeld, and ﬁnding the value to SMEs has actually been very
difﬁcult. It’s by no means clear that blockchain is the right tool for this component, and
newer cryptographic products are emerging.

In chapter 7 we take another look at NFTs. It’s impossible to ignore this stuff now.
It’s fundamentally a bit broken, but there are probably use cases, and the money and
development attention it’s getting are incredible. We try to navigate our hypothetical
virtual production partners through this as best we can.

We’re actually pretty excited about future versions of ‘digital assets’, based around
Bitcoin, because that allows us to keep just one software stack, minimising the threat
surface. We’ve mapped that forward into the open source tools that we recommend.

Chapter 8 is a big one for us as it’s our research area prior to opening up the Bitcoin
box(es). Metaverse, or at least one of the current deﬁnitions of metaverse, is just social

1.1 Overview

interaction in mixed reality (VR/AR/XR). We’ve been studying that for decades, so this
section is more academic and tried to boil down what we think is most important. The
choices we made here guided us toward the selection of free and open source metaverse
software.

We also take a look at the other deﬁnitions of ‘metaverse’ which are doing the rounds
on the web, try to unpick which is which, and what they are for, and attempt to weave
back together the best of both. This ends up looking a bit like the Venn in Figure 1.2,
where we have transmission of provable identity, non-fungible tokens bearing value or
data, distributed ﬁles, actual money (including micropayments) and a social layer based on
our best knowledge about mixed reality. In the end we abandon the word metaverse and
settle on ‘digital society’ as our preferred term.

It’s exceptionally fortunate timing for this book that the UK government has signalled
enthusiasm for so called ‘stablecoins’ at the same time that the Bitcoin network is being
upgraded to transmit these GBP equivalent tokens around. This gives us a very good idea
what it is we can build into our application stack.

Past this stage in the book we get into the murky and half developed tail end, where
we’re interfacing with our design choices, and the stack which can be deployed into the
cloud.

This book is a high level view of technologies and their potential within the developing
digital society narrative, focusing around the transmission of value within and across
immersive global networks, with a further focus on the Bitcoin monetary network.

As adoption of these technologies increases it will be necessary for people, and AI
actors, to pass economic value between themselves. These ‘goods and services’ interac-
tions, within the digital and virtual social spaces should be underpinned by a trust system,
which scales globally and presents low friction. Current secure international payment rails
are poorly suited to such interactions; indeed it is likely with legacy systems, that parties
would be forced to leave the metaverse application, and instead navigate their banking
applications to exchange value with overseas entities in a secure fashion. This might
conceivably take several days.

Fortunately, the whole landscape of money and value transfer is changing. Huge
global ﬁnancial players are entering the space. HSBC have just bought metaverse ‘land’
in The Sandbox, JP Morgan have opened a ‘lounge’ in another. The worlds largest hedge
fund Bridgewater is stepping into acquisition of digital assets, and the world’s largest
pension fund manager Blackrock partnered with Coinbase and is adding these asset to
their management engine (which manages tens of trillions of dollars). Nasdaq are offering
service to institutional clients, and Fidelity asset management are about to add Bitcoin to
their pension plans. Fidelity are also offering a dedicated metaverse tradable fund, and
considering more direct product offerings through their retail investment engine. Citigroup
have a minisite dedicated to “Metaverse and Money”. The front page of Goldman Sachs
recently says it all (Figure 1.3).

Figure 1.3: The landing page of globalﬁnancial giant Goldman Sachs shows the hype.

In Gartners 2022 hype cycle report one of their three “trend themes” says: “The future
of digital experience is immersive. A collection of emerging technologies supports such
experiences through dynamic virtual representations, environments and ecosystems of
customers and people, as well as new modes of user engagement. With these technologies,
individuals can control their own identities and data and experience virtual ecosystems
that can be integrated with digital currencies. These technologies help reach customers
in new ways to strengthen or open new revenue streams. The technologies to watch that
deliver evolving and expanding immersive experiences are metaverse, non-fungible tokens
(NFTs), super apps and Web3, decentralized identity, digital humans, digital twin of the
customer and internal talent marketplaces.”

1.2 Introduction

Of their recent investments KPMG global said: “We’ve invested in a strong cryptoassets
practice and we will continue to enhance and build on our capabilities across Decentralized
Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse, to name a few”. This is
not to say that all fund managers are so positive. PGIM who manage over a trillion pounds
globally have come out very strongly against the technology, with a slew of reports to warn
off investors (Figure 1.4).

Figure 1.4: PGIM cite ‘digiconomist’, a prominent critic.

It’s possible that for such huge organisations it makes better business sense to take a
punt on hype bubbles like this, than to do a proper due diligence with a team of internal
staff who understand their business. These endorsements should be taken with a large pinch
of salt. As Alex Johnson says: “At some point in the future, it’s possible that the digital
worlds being built today will have aggregated sufﬁcient user attention and engagement
that ﬁnancial services companies will need to invest in the metaverse as an acquisition
and customer service channel. But we’re not there yet. Until the metaverse is a little less
empty, resist the temptation to colonize it with branches and billboards.”

Meanwhile, Meta (ex Facebook) are launching their own META Web3 and metaverse
token (after abandoning Libre, their global cryptocurrency), and Google have recently
blogged: “Web3 also opens up new opportunities for creators. We believe new technologies
like blockchain and NFTs can allow creators to build deeper relationships with their fans.
Together, they’ll be able to collaborate on new projects and make money in ways not
previously possible. For example, giving a veriﬁable way for fans to own unique videos,
photos, art, and even experiences from their favourite creators could be a compelling
prospect for creators and their audiences. There’s a lot to consider in making sure we
approach these new technologies responsibly, but we think there’s incredible potential
as well. Finally, we couldn’t have a piece about innovation without touching on the
metaverse! We’re thinking big about how to make viewing more immersive. ”

It’s already the case that the recent bubble of hype is dwindling, but the enormous
investment into teams and startups will potentially bear fruit in the next couple of years,
and this perhaps has implications for small and medium-sized enterprises.

In the UK the government has stated it’s ambition to be a global cryptoasset technology
hub, and announced plans for the Royal Mint to issue a (novelty) NFT. Fuller, Economic
Secretary to the Treasury said in a speech: “We want to become the country of choice for
those looking to create, innovate and build in the crypto space [...] By making this country
a hospitable place for crypto technologies, we can attract investment, generate new jobs,
beneﬁt from tax revenues, create a wave of ground breaking new products and services,
and bridge the current position of UK ﬁnancial services into a new era.”

Like the assertion by major global businesses it is too early to tell how ‘sticky’ these

1.2 Introduction

20

claims are, but the UK legal system is clear in it’s view that all crypto assets are ‘property’.
A Law Commission consultation on “digital assets” has proposed a new third category

of property:

• it is composed of data represented in an electronic medium, including in the form of

computer code, electronic, digital or analogue signals;

• it exists independently of persons and exists independently of the legal system;
• it is rivalrous such that use by one prejudices the ability of others;
Consensus seems to be that this is a thorough paper, and demonstrates strong knowledge

of digital assets by the authors.

Gartner’s hype cycle 2022 features Web3, distributed identity, NFTs, and Metaverse

and can be seen in Figure 1.5.

Figure 1.5: The Gartners Hype Cycle for 2022.

With all this attention it seems timely to explore the potential of recent technologies,
which can address metaverse interactions in business to business (B2B), business to
customer (B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; creator to consumer, customer to
customer, consumer to consumer[1]).

This book seeks to overview and explain the available open source technologies. It
supports an open source github repository which enables SMEs to access these emergent
platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build toward a minimum viable product for trust
minimised transfer of value within a social immersive space, but also across all internet
connected devices.

Referencing is in two styles; academic works and books are numeric, while opinion
pieces, gray statistics, and pertinent news articles are hyperlinked from the text. This
hybrid style yields about twice the citation density of a normal PhD thesis, which is a
lot. For this reason the normal blue hyperlink colour was eschewed in favour of a more
aesthetic “gray”.

2. Decentralisation & Web3

When this chapter was ﬁrst started in early 2022 ‘Web3’ was at the peak of it’s hype. Web3
is still a rapidly evolving set of technologies and speciﬁcations, which are drifting further
from their origin. Decentralised web is perhaps a more useful name.

2.1 Semantic web

The “semantic web” deﬁnition of Web3.0 has been somewhat overhauled by other inno-
vations in decentralised internet technologies, now evolving toward the slightly different
Web3 moniker. Tim Berners Lee (of WWW fame) ﬁrst mentioned the semantic web in
1999 [2].

“I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the
data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A
"Semantic Web", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-
to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines
talking to machines. The "intelligent agents" people have touted for ages will ﬁnally
materialize.”

Attention developed around three core themes, ubiquitous availability and searchability
of data, intelligent search assistants, and highly available end points such as phones, and
‘internet of things’ devices. This is certainly manifesting in home devices, but few people
think of this as a Web3 revolution. Since ratiﬁcation of the standards by the World Wide
Web (W3C) consortium it seems that their imperative toward decentralisation has become
lost. Instead, it can be seen that Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple have a harmful
oligopoly on users data [3]. This is at odds with Berners-Lee’s vision, and he has recently
spoken out about this discrepancy.

It is worth taking a look at his software implementation called Solid, which is far more

mindful of the sovereignty of user data.

“Solid is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the
World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web
applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. Solid
(derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building
decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and

extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.”

Excitement around this kind of differentiated trust model, hinted at in ubiquitous
availability of data (and implemented explicitly in Solid), has led to exploration of different
paths by cryptographers, and this will be described later. For instance, one of the main
developers of Solid, Melvin Carvelho, is now a lead developer at Nostr, another very
interesting option which will be described later. This technology space is proliﬁc, but still
comparatively young and small.

2.2 Spatial web

“The Spatial Web”, a blurring of the boundaries between digital and geospatial physical
objects, seems to have developed from the strands in the original W3C scope around
devices in the real world. It has been concentrating around AR and VR but is being
marketed and ampliﬁed with the same references to availability of data (See Figure 2.1
from a Deloitte accounting report). This too is ﬁnding little traction in practice, though
obviously the component technologies continue to enjoy rapid development. Nonetheless,
this interpretation of Web3 becomes valuable when examining Metaverse later.

2.3 Web3

24

Figure 2.2: Edelman 2020 trust barometer [rights requested]

2.3 Web3

More recently Web3 is being touted as a way to connect content creators directly to content
consumers, without centralised companies acting as gatekeepers of the data. It implies that
all users have a cryptographic key management system, to which they attach metadata, that
they make requirements of peers with whom they communicate, and that they maintain
trust ‘scores’ with peers.

It seems likely that this new model is less driven by a market need, and more by the
high availability of tools which allow this to happen (the ecosystems described later). Add
to this a social response to the collapse in trust of companies such as Facebook and other
social media platforms (Figure 2.2). There is perhaps a wish by consumers to pass more of
the economic incentive to content creators, without the ‘rent seeking’ layer afforded by
businesses, and a healthy dose of mania driven market speculation.

2.3.1 Emerging consensus

The current hype cycle is ignoring the legacy deﬁnitions described above and instead
focusing almost exclusively on Ethereum based peer-to-peer projects. It can be seen that
the description is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.

It’s possible to frame this Ethereum Web3 as a hugely complex and inefﬁcient digital

2.3 Web3

25

rights management system (DRM). DRM is something that users of the internet are
increasingly familiar and comfortable with. It’s somewhat debatable whether decentralising
this is worthwhile. The thesis of the developers of the technology seems to be that without
it, control of ‘value’ will accrete over time, to one or more hegemonic controlling entities.
It’s a strong argument, but there is a substantial counter argument emerging that users
just don’t want this stuff. The nervousness of legislators in the USA to the attempt by
Facebook/Meta to enter this peer-to-peer value transmission space is telling in terms of the
perception of who is driving Web3.

Throughout 2022 there has been much furore on the internet over what Web3 might
be, and who it ‘serves’. Enthusiasts feel that products such as Sign-In with Ethereum
(EIP-4361) will give users choice over their data sovereignty, and a meme to this effect
is seen in Figure 2.3. In practice though users are expecting to use badly written, buggy,
economically vulnerable ‘crypto’ wallets to log into websites. The quality of this wallet
software is improving of late with the so called “wallet wars” seeing commerce grade
offerings from Coinbase and shares platform ‘Robinhood’. These two companies alone
have over 100 million users. It’s likely that these wallets will evolve to offer the full
spectrum of Web3 functionality. With that said it doesn’t seem to make much sense yet on
the face of it. There are in fact examples of the technology completely failing at censorship
resistance. Popular ‘Web3’ browser extension Metamask and NFT platform Opensea have
both recently banned countries in response to global sanction pressure. This failure to
meaningfully decentralise will be explored further in the distributed identity section.

This new hyped push for Web3 is being driven by enormous venture capital investment.
A16Z are a major player in this new landscape and have released their ten principles for
emergent Web3.

• Establish a clear vision to foster decentralized digital infrastructure
• Embrace multi-stakeholder approaches to governance and regulation
• Create targeted, risk-calibrated oversight regimes for different web3 activities
• Foster innovation with composability, open source code, and the power of open

2.3 Web3

communities

26

• Broaden access to the economic beneﬁts of the innovation economy
• Unlock the potential of DAOs
• Deploy web3 to further sustainability goals
• Embrace the role of well-regulated stablecoins in ﬁnancial inclusion and innovation
• Collaborate with other nations to harmonize standards and regulatory frameworks
• Provide clear, fair tax rules for the reporting of digital assets, and leverage technical

solutions for tax compliance

This list seems targeted toward the coming regulatory landscape, and could be considered
at odds with the original tenants of an organically emergent, decentralised internet. Indeed
principles such as ‘furthering sustainability goals’ seem downright incongruous. The
community they claim to wish to support here are openly critical of these major institutional
players and their motives, with even more pointed criticisms coming from outside of the
Web3. This book and lab steer well clear of these companies and their applications.

Dante Disparte, chief strategy ofﬁcer of ‘Circle’ venture capital, said in testimony to a
US senate hearing; that Web 1 was ‘read’, Web 2 was ‘read write’, and that Web 3 will
‘read write own’. The important takeaway here is not so much this oft quoted elevator pitch
for Web3, but the fact that legislative bodies now consider this technology a force which
they need to be aware of and potentially contend with.

Jeremy Allaire, again of Circle’, talks about the recent legislative order in the USA as
follows: “this is a watershed moment for crypto, digital assets, and Web 3, akin to the
1996/1997 whole of government wakeup to the commercial internet. The U.S. seems to be
taking on the reality that digital assets represent one of the most signiﬁcant technologies
and infrastructures for the 21st century; it’s rewarding to see this from the WH after so
many of us have been making the case for 9+ years.”

We will see in the following chapters that participation in this new Web3 is contingent
on owning cryptocurrencies. It’s estimated that about 6% of people in the UK own some
cryptocurrency, with skews to both younger demographics, and smaller holdings. The
legislative landscape in the UK is comparatively strict with questionable “know your
customer / anti money laundering” (KYC/AML) data collection mandated in law. Users of
UK exchanges must provide a great deal of personal ﬁnancial information, and undertake
to prove that the wallets they are withdrawing to are their own. From the perspective
of the UK SME it seems this seriously limits the potential audience for new products.
Europe meanwhile has recently voted through even more restrictive regulation, applying
the “transfer of funds regulation” to all transactions coming out of exchanges, enforcing
a database of all addresses between companies, and reporting transactions above 1000
Euros to authorities. They have narrowly avoided enforcing KYC on all transfers to private
wallets. The “Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation is an onerous overhead that
will likely make it impossible for smaller businesses in the sector to operate within the
EU. This is still short of the ban that they have discussed in private. It seems that this EU
position has prompted the UK government to seize the potential competitive advantage
offered, and there will be more on this later.

It’s a complex evolving narrative, and clearly contradictions are common. Right now
there seems little appeal for stepping into Web3. Into the confusion, this book advances
a narrow take, and toolset, which might extract some value from the technologies, while
maintaining a low barrier to entry.

2.4 The common thread

27

2.4 The common thread

One feature which persists throughout all of these interpretations of Web3 is the need
for decentralised trust. According to Nathaniel Whittemore, a journalist for Coindesk,
“The Web3 moniker positions this industry in opposition to big tech”. Alternatively the
many detractors of the technology think it simply provides avenues for incumbents to
experiment with new models of control and monetisation, increasing systemic risk at no
cost to themselves.

Overall then, perhaps the space is hype, and is certainly rife with scams. The degree to
which it even accomplishes decentralised trust is highly debatable, and meanwhile the lim-
ited numbers of Web3 and supporting crypto companies display lamentable cyber security
practice themselves, creating honeypots of personal data from users of the ecosystem.

With that said the component parts necessary to deliver on the promise do exist. If
there is to be no central controlling party(s) as in the Web 2 model then nothing can happen
without a cryptographically secure underpinning, allowing digital data to be passed around
without a prior arrangement.

The following chapter will describe how much has been done by computer scientists
over the past decades to support that. From this base layer we also get the potential
for secure and trust minimised identity management. This nascent ﬁeld of distributed
identity management is explained later. From distributed trust models we can see ‘trustless’
transmission of economic value. The ability to send value from one person to another
person or service without a third party.

This whole area is ‘crypto’, which is increasingly seeping into the human consciousness,
and saw an astonishing $30B of capital investment in 2021 alone. At time of writing the
industry is an over 1 trillion dollar market.

Of their 2022 ‘Big Ideas’ report, ARK investment LLC (who manage a $50B tech
investment) said the following (Figure 2.4), which connects some of the dots already
mentioned, and leads us into the next section which is Blockchain and Bitcoin:

“While many (with heavily vested interests) want to deﬁne all things blockchain as
web3 we believe that web3 is best understood as just 1 of 3 revolutions that the innovation
of bitcoin has catalyzed.

• The Money Revolution
• The Financial Revolution
• The Internet Revolution”
All the new crypto technologies circling the Web3 narrative are bound tightly together,

but there is currently very little meaningful value to be seen.

The rest of this book will focus on the trust and value transfer elements of this shift in
internet technologies, and attempt to build a case for it’s use in decentralised, open source,
metaverse applications.

3. DLT, Blockchain, and Bitcoin

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a data structure distributed across multiple manag-
ing stakeholders. A subset of DLT is blockchain, which is a less efﬁcient, immutable data
structure with a slightly different trust model. Rauchs et al. of the Cambridge Centre for
Alternative Finance provide a detailed taxonomy and conceptual framework [4]. It can be
seen in their paper that the deﬁnitions are somewhat unclear in literature.

DLT, and especially blockchain, are rapidly gaining ground in the public imagination,

within ﬁnancial technology companies (FinTech), and in the broader corporate world.

The technology and the global legislative response are somewhat immature, and

misapplications of both technologies are commonplace.

Distributed trust models emerged from cryptography research in the 1970s when
Merkle, Difﬁe, and Hellman at Stanford worked out how to send messages online without
a trusted third party [5, 6].

Soon after the 1980s saw the emergence of the cypherpunk activist movement, as
a reaction to the emerging surveillance state [7, 8]. These early computer scientists in
the USA saw the intersectionality between information, computation, economics, and
personal freedom [9]. Online discussion in the early nineties foresaw the emergence of
trans-national digital markets, what would become the WWW [10, 11]. The issues of
privacy and the exchange of digital value (digital / ecash) were of foremost importance
within these discussions and while privacy was within reach thanks to “public/private key
pairs”, ecash proved to be a more difﬁcult problem.

Adam Back’s 1997 ‘hashcash’ [12] paved the way for later work by implementing
the concept of what would become ‘proof of work’ [13, 14]. This was built upon by Dai
[15], Szabo [16], Finney [17], and Nakamoto amongst others. In all it took 16 years of
collaboration on the mailing lists (and dozens of failed attempts) to attack the problem of
trust-minimised, distributed, digital cash. The culmination of these attempts was Bitcoin
[18]. This is illustrated by Dan Held in Figure 3.1. This is now a wider ecosystem of
technologies and societal challenges 3.2.

There is enormous complexity and scope, as seen in Figure 3.3, and yet genuinely
useful products are elusive. It is surprisingly hard to pin down a simple explanation for the
features which deﬁne a blockchain. These “key takeaway” from Investopedia are a neat
summary however.

• Blockchain is a speciﬁc type of database.
• It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store

data in blocks that are then chained together.

• As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is ﬁlled with
data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in
chronological order.

• Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common

use so far has been as a ledger for transactions.

• In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person

or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.

• Decentralized blockchains are “append only”. In effect this means that the data
entered becomes irreversible over time. For Bitcoin, this means that simple economic
transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.

In principle blockchains provide a differentiated trust model. With a properly dis-
tributed system a blockchain can be considered “trust-minimised”, though certainly not risk
minimised. This is important for some, but not all people. There is not much emboldening
of text within this book. If you start to question the whole reason for this ‘global technology
revolution’ then it always comes back to those three words.

It can in fact be argued that the whole concept of distributed cryptographic blockchains
is somewhat strained, as the vast majority of the technology offerings are not distributed,
and worse, meaningful distribution may indeed be practically impossible without a trusted

3.1 What’s this for sorry?

third party [19]. “There are many scenarios where traditional databases should be used
instead”[20].

3.1 What’s this for sorry?

The proponents of blockchains argue, that in an era when data breaches and corporate
ﬁnancial insolvency intersect with a collapse in trust of institutions, it is perhaps useful to
have an alternative model for storage of data, and value. That seems like a lot of effort for
a questionable gain. It’s far more likely it’s simply speculation.

While writing this book the questions of ‘what is this really for and how can it possibly
be worth it’, came up again and again. In truth it’s a very difﬁcult question, without a
clear enough answer. It’s beyond the scope of this book to ﬁgure this out properly, but
references to advantages and disadvantages will be made throughout.

It seems that the engineers who created Bitcoin wanted very much to solve a technical
problem they saw with money (from their understanding of it), and the transmission of
money digitally. As the scale and scope have increased so has the narrative evolved as seen
in Figure 3.4, but it’s never really kept pace with the level of the questions posed.

Figure 3.4: The narrative use of Bitcoin has evolved, by Nic Carter and Hasuﬂy.

A cost beneﬁt analysis that excludes speculative gains seems to fail for pretty much
all of blockchain/DLT. Bitcoin is more subtle as it possibly can circumvent the legacy
ﬁnancial systems. This still leaves huge questions. To quote others in the space, is Bitcoin
now the iceberg or the life raft?

For the most cogent defence of the technology as it stands in this moment, Gladstein
(and others) offer a vision for the asset class, in the 87% of the world he says don’t
have access to the beneﬁts enjoyed by the developed west [21]. He points to Block and
Wakeﬁeld Research’s report which ﬁnds those living under ﬁnancially oppressive regimes
are the most optimistic about the technology as in Figure 3.5. This argument is suggestive
of huge and untapped markets for services which may be accessible to developed nations
through telepresence/metaverse interfaces.

Gladstein’s is a carefully developed and well researched book, but is written from the
perspective of (just) Bitcoin ‘being the raft’. Later in this book we will consider if it might
be the iceberg, but this is not the domain expertise we offer in this book.

To further contextualise this Mike Novogratz claims the adoption ﬁgures at the top of
the page. Raoul Pal of RealVision says: Crypto adoption is now massively outperforming
the internet. It’s been growing at about 165% a year versus 85% for the internet for the
same period of time now.

Thanks to a natural ﬁt with strong encryption, and innate resistance to censorship by
external parties, these systems do lend themselves well to ‘borderless’ applications, and are
somewhat resistant to global regulation (for good or ill). Given the rates of adoption seen
above it seems that this stuff is coming regardless of their somewhat marginal usefulness.
This provides us an excellent use case to explore for metaverse applications, and this will
be the focus.

3.2 Bitcoin

The ﬁrst blockchain was the Bitcoin network [18], some two decades after Haber et al.
ﬁrst described the idea [22]. Prior to Bitcoin these structures were called ‘timechains’
[23]. It can be considered a triple entry book keeping system [24, 25], the ﬁrst of it’s kind,

3.2 Bitcoin

34

integrating a ‘provable’ timestamp with a transaction ledger, solving the “double spend
problem” [26, 27, 28]. Some see this as the ﬁrst major innovation in ledger technology
since double entry was codiﬁed in Venice in fourteen seventy ﬁve[29].

It was created pseudonomously by an individual or group calling themselves ‘Satoshi
Nakamoto’ in 2009, as a direct response to the perceived mishandling of the 2008 global
ﬁnancial crisis [23], with the stated aim of challenging the status quo, with an uncensorable
technology, to create a money which could not be debased by inﬂation policy, and outside
of the politically captured ﬁntech incumbents. It’s interesting to note that the narrative
around the use case for Bitcoin has shifted over it’s lifetime.

The “genesis block” which was hard coded at the beginning of the ‘chain’ contains text

from The Times newpaper detailing the second bank bailout.

There will only ever be (just short of) 21 million bitcoins issued, of which around 19
million have already been minted, and around 4 million lost forever. This ‘hard money’
absolute scarcity is a strong component of the Bitcoin meme landscape. These are basically
arbitrary ﬁgures though; a combination of the issuance schedule, and an ‘educated guess’
by Nakamoto: [23]

”My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It
was a difﬁcult choice, because once the network is going it’s locked in and we’re stuck with
it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but
without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle.
If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you
imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be
21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”

In theory there is no barrier to access, and equality of opportunity to accumulate and
save over long periods. This is not true of chains and tokens since, which lock up some
of their value for seed investors to cash out later. None of the blockchains since are
decentralised in the same way [30]. Bitcoin was probably a singular event.

Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis (sats), so anyone buying into
Bitcoin can buy a thousandth of a pound, assuming they can ﬁnd someone willing to
transact that with them.

Satoshi Nakamoto (the name of the publishing entity) disappeared from the forums
forever in 2010. Bitcoin has the marks of cypherpunks and anarcho capitalism. The IMF
has recently conceded that the Bitcoin poses a risk to the traditional ﬁnancial systems, so it
could be argued that it is succeeding in this original aim.

Although there were some earlier experiments (hashcash, b-money etc), Bitcoin is
the ﬁrst viably decentralised ‘cryptocurrency’; the network is used to store economic
value because it is judged to be secure and trusted. It is a singular event in that it became
established at scale, such that it could be seen to be a fully distributed system, without a
controlling entity. This is the differentiated trust model previously mentioned. This relative
security is the speciﬁc unique selling point of the network. It is many times more secure
than all the networks which came after based on a like for like comparison of transaction
‘conﬁrmations’. This network effect of Bitcoin is a compounding feature, attracting value
through the security of the system. It is deliberately more conservative and feature poor,
preferring instead to add to it’s feature set slowly, preserving the integrity of the value
invested in it over the last decade. At time of writing it is a top quartile largest global
currency and has settled over $13 trillion Dollars in 2021, though Makarov et al. contest
this, citing network overheads, and speculation [31]. Institution grade ‘exchange tradable

funds’ which allow investment in Bitcoin are available throughout the world, and the native
asset can be bought by the public easily through apps in all but a handful of countries as
seen in Figure 3.6.

Only around 7 transactions per second can be settled on Bitcoin. The native protocol
does not scale well, and this is an inherent trade-off as described by Croman et al. in
their positioning paper on public blockchains [32]. Over time, competition for the limited
transaction bandwidth drives up the price to use the network. This effectively prices out
small transactions, even locking up some value below what is a termed the ’dust limit’ of
unspent transactions too small to ever move again [33].

Bitcoin has developed quickly, with a faster adoption than even the internet itself. It is
already a mature ecosystem, with enterprise grade software stacks, and is seeing adoption
as a corporate treasury asset.

Adoption by civil authorities is increasing, and legislators the world over are being
forced to adopt a position. California has an explicitly Web 3 and blockchain executive
order to invetigate and support opportunities. Many city treasuries have added it to their
balance sheet. Honduras has launched “Bitcoin Valley” as a tourist initiative, and the
Swiss city of Lugano is launching a huge initiative alongside Tether. It is already legal
tender in the country of El Salvador[34] and the Central African Republic, and will be
soon in Madeira and Roatán island. This means it must be accepted as a means of payment.
CAR are also launching their own Bitcoin sidechain (like Liquid described later) as a pan
African initiative. In places such as Panama it simply has legal status and can be accepted
without double taxation.

Global asset manager “Fidelity” wrote the following in their 2021 trends report. “We

3.2 Bitcoin

36

also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if Bitcoin adoption
increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than
their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or
adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other
words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger
cost years in the future. We therefore wouldn’t be surprised to see other sovereign nation
states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.”

3.2.1 The Bitcoin Network Software

There isn’t a single GitHub which can be considered the ﬁnal arbiter of the development
direction, because it is a distributed community effort with some 500 developers out of
a wider ‘crypto’ pool of around 9000 contributors (the vast majority are spread across
disparate Ethereum and some Solana projects). Development and innovation continues but
there is an emphasis on careful iteration to avoid damage to the network. Visualisation of
code commitments to the various open source software repositories can be seen at Bitpaint
youtube channel and in Figure 3.7.

Figure 3.7: Bitpaint: Contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Reused with permission.

Bitcoin core is the main historical effort (with around a dozen major contributors
guiding the direction), but there are alternatives (LibBitcoin in C++, BTCD in Go, and
BitcoinJ in Java), and as innovation on layer one slows, attention is shifting to codebases
which interact with the base layer asset. Much more on these later.

3.2.2 Mining and Energy concerns

3.2.2.1 Mining process overview

Bitcoin mining is the process of adding public transactions into the ledger, in return for two
economic rewards, paid in Bitcoin. These are the mining fee, and the block reward. The
transactions which are added into the next ‘block’ of the chain are selected preferentially
based on the fee they offer, which is up to the user trying to get their transaction into the
chain. This can be within the next 10 minutes (next block), or a gamble out toward ’never’
depending how competitive the network is at any time. Miners try to ﬁnd a sufﬁciently
low result from a cryptographic hash function [35](a random process), and upon ﬁnding
it, they can take their pre-prepared ‘block’ of transactions sourced from their local queue
(mempool), and add it into the chain, for conﬁrmation by other miners. In return they take
all the fees within that mined block, and whatever the block reward is at the time. When the
network started the block reward was 50 Bitcoin, but has halved repeatedly every 210,000
blocks (four years) and now stands at 6.25 BTC. The rate of mining is kept roughly at
one block every 10 minutes, by a difﬁculty adjustment every 2016 blocks (2 weeks). This

3.2 Bitcoin

37

in a complex interdependent mechanism and is explained very well in this article. These
components are explained in slightly more detail later.

3.2.2.2 Energy & policy response

Bitcoin uses a staggering amount of energy to secure the blockchain (Figure 3.8), and
this has climate repercussions. A simple back of the envelope use of the IEA total energy
supply, and the Cambridge Bitcoin energy use estimate puts the network at around 0.1%
of global energy use.

Figure 3.8: Bitcoin network vs TOP500 supercomputers

It is an industrial scale global business with ‘mining companies’ investing hundreds of
millions of pounds at a time in specialist ASIC mining hardware and facilities. The latest
purpose designed Intel chip touts both Web3 and metaverse applications. This is “proof
of work”, and is essential to the technology, and is still thought by some to be the best
available option. The Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index monitors this energy
usage. Their 2022 report sees American mining leading globally.

Such businesses can mine a Bitcoin for around $5k-$10k per coin, so the proﬁt margins
are considerable (based on 30-40 Joule/terahash and power rate less than 5 cents/kilowatt
hour and excluding hardware costs). This is not to say that all mining is, or should be,
so concentrated. Anyone running the hashing algorithm can get lucky and claim the
block reward. PoW ties the value of the ‘money’ component of Bitcoin directly to energy
production. This is not a new idea. Henry Ford proposed an intimate tie between energy
and money to create a separation of powers from government, as can be seen in Figure 3.9.
The potential ecological footprint of the network has always been a concern; Hal Finney
himself was thinking about this issue with a mature Bitcoin network as early as 2009,
and a debate on the Bitcoin mailing lists called the mining process “thermodynamically
perverse”. The most cited negative analysis on the matter by Mora et al sees Bitcoin mining
alone warming the planet above 2 degrees [36].

3.2 Bitcoin

38

Figure 3.9: Intimate tie between energy and money, Henry Ford

Proponents of the technology say that the balance shifted dramatically in 2021 with
China outright banning the technology; this has forced the bulk of the energy use toward
the USA, and away from ‘dirty coal’ as seen in Figure 3.10. Some adherents have proposed
mitigations [37]. As a worked example of Cross and Bailey’s proposal a retail investor
owning 1 BTC would have to buy around 700 shares of ‘CleanSpark’ mining company
(CLSK) to make their holding completely neutral. Some more strident voices suggest that
‘ending ﬁnancialisation’ through use of Bitcoin may be net positive for the environment
at a macro level [38]. Indeed it may provide a route to support electrifying everything
through deployment of ﬂexible demand load. This enables a kind of ‘ﬁnancial battery’
that can soak up excess capacity from overbuilt renewables (something which needs to be
done). Local subsidy initiatives may begin to drive this kind of adoption as seems to be
happening in Texas[39, 40]. Brad Jones, interim CEO of the Texas grid said:

“As we get more renewable generation, in particular wind [which] is operating at
night ... we have to ﬁnd a home for it, otherwise we have to turn the wind down. It’s such a
great resource we shouldn’t turn it down. Bitcoin mining or what some call crypto has
found a way to come into our markets and take some of that wind in off-peak periods. Then
when we get to peak period times they are very quick to remove themselves from the market
as prices increases The fact that we can turn down whenever we need the power for other
customers is fantastic. We can use that crypto currency to soak up that excess generation
when there’s a lot of that, and ﬁnd a home for more solar and more wind to come to our
grid. Then they reduce consumption when we need that power for other customers. So
it’s a great balancing act. Most other datacenters [such as] Microsoft or Amazon have
other customers to serve every other day, so they can’t just turn off. But these crypto
customers can. If the cost of energy gets too high they can remove themselves from the
market. They are also helpful if we lose a generator. They can quickly respond to that
frequency disruption and allow us to balance our grid.”
This “global energy market revolution” is explained by Tabatabai of Modo Energy.

There is growing interest and adoption of so called “stranded energy mining” which
cannot be effectively transmitted to consumers, and is thereby sold at a huge discount
while also developing power capacity, without the usual constraints [41], re-purposing
historic infrastructure, and/or reducing the carbon (or more interestingly the methane) of
existing infrastructure. Adam Wright of Vespene Energy says: “You could either mine
Bitcoin on one small landﬁll for a year, or you could plant 5 million trees and let them
grow for 10 years - both of those are going to have the same environmental impact.”

Cheikosman, a policy analyst for the World Economic Forum (somewhat surprisingly)
wrote “Crypto is becoming an essential part of developing a carbon-neutral energy grid
and has made it economically viable to invest in, develop and build renewable energy power
generation.” The market economics of this are far from simple, but are well explained by
Connell in a podcast.

The most cited example of building capacity before grid connection is El Salvador’s
‘volcano mining’ proposal, which is supporting their national power infrastructure plans.
Uzbekistan seems to be promoting a similar model with zero tax provided the Bitcoin
mining companies build out their own solar infrastructure. A more poignant example is the
Mechanicville hydro plant in the USA. The refurbishment of this 123 year old power plant
is being funded by Bitcoin mining. This is the “buyer of last resort” model ﬁrst advanced
by Square Inc.

Conversely it might be that vertical integration of Bitcoin mining within legacy fossil
fuel stations gives them a new lease of life. New York State has dealt with this kind of
threat by imposing a moratorium on new, fossil fuel powered mining activity. On a global
stage something as portable and industrial as Bitcoin mining will have unintended impacts

3.2 Bitcoin

Figure 3.11: Climate tech investor Daniel Batten asserts that methane capture could highly
impactful

on fragile energy systems, as has happened in South Ossetia and Kazakhstan. Undeniably
the consensus position is that it’s overall very negative, (with some caveats) and this will
probably persist. Perhaps though if it’s happening anyway, then ﬁnding utility of the asset
might mitigate the net harm.

More pragmatically, Baur and Oll found that “Bitcoin investments can be less carbon
intensive than standard equity investments and thus reduce the total carbon footprint of a
portfolio.”[42]. Perhaps of note for the near future is that KPMG whose investment was
mentioned in the introduction also matched their position in the space with equivalent
carbon offsets. This may provide an investment and growth model for others.

The power commitment to the network is variously projected to increase, or level off
over time, but certainly not decrease. The industry now argues that economic pressures
mean that most of the ‘hashrate’ is generated by renewable energy[43]. As a recent example
of this trend Telsa (Elon Musk), Block (Twitters Jack Dorsey), and Blockstream (Adam
Back) are teaming up to mine with solar energy in Texas.

The debate whether this consumption is ‘worth’ it is complex and rapidly evolving.

Useful examples of this are:

• the online pushback to an academic article by PhD candidate de Vries et al. [44]
• the assertion that the widely cited Mora er al. paper in Nature [36] was based on an
undergraduate class discussion, and has had an outsized effect on global policy.

• a paper from the Bitcoin Policy Institute,
• and the industry open letter to the EPA.
• this well considered Twitter thread by climate scientist Margot Paez.

It is somewhat confusing that positive views are coming only from diverse and non-
specialist voices in the community, and never the academic community, but the shortcom-

3.2 Bitcoin

41

ings they point out in the supposedly considered articles such as Mora et al [36] are easily
veriﬁed. Academia seems poorly positioned to pivot to this subject, as an ethical bar has
to be established before research can commence, and the ﬁeld is too new to make this an
affordable task. This stuff is existentially important to the whole technology. Is a trillion
dollar asset which potentially replaces the money utility of gold, but doesn’t need to be
stored under guard in vaults (Figure 3.12), worth the equivalent power consumption of
clothes dryers in North America? Probably not with the current level of adoption, but this
is an experiment in replacing global money. If that were to happen then Bitcoin would be
around 50 times more efﬁcient than the current system according to Khazzaka [45]. To
be clear it’s not the position of this book that replacing Fiat money is a good idea, but the
experiment is being run regardless. This is explored in it’s own chapter later.
It seems possible that three value propositions are therefore emerging:
• Bitcoin the speculative asset (or greater fool bubble [46]). Nations such as the
USA, who own 30% of the asset have bid up the price of the tokens during a period
of very cheap money, and this has led to a high valuation for the tokens, with a
commensurately high network security through the hash rate (mining). This could
be a speculative bubble, with the asset shifting to one of the other valuations below.
• Bitcoin the monetary network, and ‘emerging market’ value transfer mechanism.
There is no sense of the “value” of this network at this time, but it’s the aspect
we need for our metaverse application. For this use the price must simply be high
enough to ensure that mining viably secures the network. This security ﬂoor is
unfortunately a ‘known unknown’. If a global Bitcoin monetary axis evolves (as
in the Money chapter later) the network would certainly require a higher rate than
currently, suggestive of a higher price of token to ensure mining.

• Bitcoin as a ﬂexible load in power distribution systems, and methane mitigation
‘asset’. Again there is no price against this, but we can perhaps grossly estimate it at
around half the current hash rate if 50% of the network is currently green energy.
This would imply a price for the asset roughly where it is now (ie, not orders of
magnitude higher or lower).

Legislators globally, are starting to codify their positions on proof of work as a technology
(including Bitcoin). The USA is variously supporting or constricting the technology,
according to state legislatures. Notably New York has banned new carbon intensive mining
facilities for 2 years, while rust and farm belt states with energy build-out problems are
providing incentives. At the federal level the recent “Climate and energy implications”
report is parts positive and parts negative about proof of work, and leaves the door open to a
legislative clampdown. It does seems to admit that there is a knowledge gap, and essentially
suggests more research. Perhaps most interestingly it notes the potential of methane
mitigation as mentioned earlier. I is conceivable that methane mitigation alone could
provide a route forward for the technology. The report says: “The crypto-asset industry
can potentially use stranded methane gas, which is the principal component of natural gas,
to generate electricity for mining. Methane gas is produced during natural gas drilling
and transmission, and by oil wells, landﬁlls, sewage treatment, and agricultural processes.
Methane is a potent GHG that can result in 27 to 30 times the global warming potential of
CO2 over a 100-year time frame, and is about 80 times as powerful as CO2 over a 20-year
timeframe. Reducing methane emissions can slow near-term climate warming, which
is why the Biden-Harris Administration released the U.S. methane emissions reduction
action plan in 2021. Venting and ﬂaring methane at oil and natural gas wells wastes 4% of

3.2 Bitcoin

42

Figure 3.12: Goldman suggest growth opportunity and potential demonetisation of gold?

3.2 Bitcoin

43

global methane production. In 2021, venting and ﬂaring methane emitted the equivalent of
400 million metric tons of CO2, representing about 0.7% of global GHG emissions. This
methane is vented or ﬂared, because of the high cost of constructing permanent pipelines
or electricity transmission that could transport the methane or its potential electricity
generation from remote oil and gas operations to end-users, or because of the high cost of
installing equipment on older landﬁlls. Crypto-asset companies are now exploring ways
to use electricity generation from vented and ﬂared methane at oil and gas wells and at
landﬁlls. While the EPA and the Department of the Interior have proposed new rules to
reduce methane for oil and natural gas operations, crypto-asset mining operations that
capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate,
by converting the potent methane to CO2 during combustion. Mining operations that
replace existing methane ﬂares would not likely affect CO2 emissions, since this methane
would otherwise be ﬂared and converted to CO2. Mining operations, though, could
potentially be more reliable and more efﬁcient at converting methane to CO2. While such
operations can reduce wasted methane, another option is low-cost recovery of methane
using existing vapor capture technologies at oil and gas wells, which can reduce global
methane emissions up to 50% by 2030.”

The EU has just voted to add the whole of ‘crypto’, including PoW, to the EU taxonomy
for sustainable activities. This EU wide classiﬁcation system provides investors with
guidance as to the sustainability of a given technology, and can have a meaningful impact
on the ﬂows of investment. With that said the report and addition of PoW is not slated
until 2025, and it is by no means clear what the analysis will be by that point. Meanwhile
they’re tightening controls of transactions, on which there will be more detail later. For
it’s part the European Central Bank has come out in favour of strong constraints on crypto
mining. They use the widely discredited “digiconimist” estimates to assert that mining
operations are disproportionately damaging to the environment.

We have seen that China has cracked down hard on the technology, banning mining
and pressuring holders of the assets. They have unwound this somewhat, and based on past
experience it seems that they will continue to nuance their position as they seek adoption
of their own digital currency. As much as 20% of all mining activity is now suspected to
take place within China.

In India there has been confusion for years as more “local” law vies with confusing
central government signalling. It has variously been banned and unbanned, and is now
subject to punitive tax. The central bank of India is strongly in favour of a complete ban.
Ajay Seth, secretary of the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs recently
said “We have gone through a deep dive consulting with not just the domestic and insti-
tutional stakeholders but also organizations like IMF and World Bank.... Simultaneously
we are also beginning our work for some sort of a global regulation (to determine) what
role India can play... Whatever we do, even if we go to the extreme form, the countries that
have chosen to prohibit, they can’t succeed unless there is a global consensus”

It feels like a global political response is just around the corner, but reputable voices in
the community suggest that it always feels this way. There is more detail on this in Money
chapter later in the book.

3.2.3 Technical overview

This section could be far more detailed, but this is pretty complex stuff. Instead, there’s
plenty of books and websites that do a more thorough job, if the reader is interested. Each

3.2 Bitcoin

44

subsection will include a good external link where more depth can be found. This whistle
stop tour of the main components of the protocol should provide enough grounding, but
it’s not essential reading for non technical readers.

3.2.3.1 ECDSA / SHA256 / secp256k1

These technologies tend to use the same underpinning elliptic curve cryptography, and it
makes sense to unpack this here just once, only in the context of Bitcoin, as this will be the
main focus of our attention.

Public keys are a huge number used in conjunction with an algorithm to encrypt data.
This allows a remote party to interact with an actor on the network whose private keys can
decrypt that same data.

In Bitcoin the ECDSA algorithm is used on the secp256k1 elliptic function to create a
trapdoor. This (essentially) one way mathematical operation was originally the “discrete
log problem” and part of the research in cryptography by Difﬁe and Hellman [5]. This is
what binds the public and private keys in a key pair (the foundation of the whole space).
In their mathematical construct a modulus operator creates an inﬁnite number of
possible variations on operations which multiply enormous exponential numbers together,
in different orders, to create key pairs. In order to reverse back through the ‘trapdoor’ a
probably impossible number of guesses would have to be applied.

Latterly, elliptic curves such as the secp256k1 curve used in Bitcoin have substantially
simpliﬁed the computation problems. Rather than exponentials used by Difﬁe Helmman
instead a repeated operation is applied to an elliptic curve function, and this itself creates a
discrete log problem trapdoor in maths, far more efﬁciently. Figure 3.13 suggests how this
works.

This makes it easier, faster, and cheaper to provide secure key pairs on basic com-
putational resources. Elliptic curve solutions are not ‘provably’ secure in the same way
as the Difﬁe-Hellman approach, and the security of this system is very sensitive to the
randomness which is applied to the operation. Aﬁcionados of Bitcoin use dice rolls or
even more exotic means to add entropy (randomness) when creating keys. This really isn’t
necessary, the software does this well enough.

ECDSA has already been replaced by the more efﬁcient Schnorr signature method [47]
which uses the same mathematical curve so is backward compatible. This will take some
time for organic adoption, and ECDSA will never be deprecated.

3.2.3.2 Addresses & UTXOs

Ethereum has addresses which transactions ﬂow in and out of. This is synonymous to a
bank account number and so makes intuitive sense to users of banks. This is not the case
in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a UTXO model blockchain. UTXO stands for unspent transaction output,
and these are ‘portions’ of Bitcoin created and destroyed as value changes hands (through
the action of cryptographic keys). They are the basis of the evolving ledger. This process
is described well by Rajarshi Maitra in this post.

“Every Transaction input consists of a pointer and an unlocking key. The pointer points
back to a previous transaction output. And the key is used to unlock the previous output it
points to. Every time an output is successfully unlocked by an input, it is marked inside
the blockchain database as ‘spent’. Thus you can think of a transaction as an abstract
“action” that deﬁnes unlocking some previous outputs, and creating new outputs.
These new outputs can again be referred by a new transaction input. A UTXO or ‘Unspent

3.2 Bitcoin

45

Figure 3.13: Given a start point on the curve and a number of reﬂection operations it’s
trivial to ﬁnd a number at the end point, but impossible to ﬁnd the number of hops from
the two end points alone. (CC Mastering Bitcoin second edition)

3.2 Bitcoin

46

Transaction Output’ is simply all those outputs, which are yet to be unlocked by an input.
Once an output is unlocked, imagine they are removed from circulating supply and new
outputs take their place. Thus the sum of the value of unlocked outputs will be always
equal to the sum of values of newly created outputs (ignoring transaction fees for now)
and the total circulating supply of bitcoins remains constant.”

Fresh UTXOs are created as coinbase transactions, rewarded to miners who successfully
mine a block. These can be spent to multiple output as normal. This is how the supply
increases over time.

3.2.3.3 Bitcoin script

A Bitcoin script is a short chunk of code written into each transaction which gives condi-
tions for the next UTXO transfer (spend). The limited scripting language and the features
built into wallets on top, allow for some clever additional options beside receiving and
spending. In fact, some of the more innovative features such as discrete log contracts
(detailed later) are quite powerful, and can interact with the outside world. Scripts allow
spends to be contingent on multiple sets of authorising keys, time locks into the future, or
both.

3.2.3.4 Halving

As mentioned eariler, roughly every four year the ‘block reward’ given to miners halves.
This gives the issuances schedule of Bitcoin; it’s monetary inﬂation. This ‘controlled
supply’ feature was added to emulate the growth of physical asset stocks through mining.
It’s exhaustively explained elsewhere and is somewhat immaterial to our transactional use
case in metaverse applications.

3.2.3.5 Difﬁculty adjustment

The difﬁcult adjustment (also mentioned earlier) shifts the difﬁculty of the mining algorithm
globally to re-target one new block every 10 minutes. This means that adding a glut of
new mining equipment will increase the issuance of Bitcoins, in favour of the new mining
entity, for up to 2 weeks, at which point the difﬁculty increases, the schedule resets, and the
advantage to the new miner is diffused. Equally this protects the network against signiﬁcant
loss of global mining hashrate, as happened when China comprehensively banned mining.
Again, this is explained in more detail elsewhere.

3.2.3.6 Bitcoin nodes

The Bitcoin network can be considered a triumvirate of economic actors, each with different
incentives. These are:

• Holders and users of the tokens, including exchanges and market makers, who
make money speculating, arbitraging, and providing liquidity into the network.
Increasingly this is also real ‘money’ users of BTC, earning and spending in pools
of circular economic activity. Perversely Bitcoin as a money is the fringe use case at
this time.

• Miners, who proﬁt from creation of new UTXOs, and receive payments for adding
transactions to the chain. In return they secure the network by validating the other
miners blocks according the rules enforced by the node operators.

• Node operators, who enforce the consensus rule-set, which the miners must abide
by in order to propagate new transaction into the network. In return node operators
optimise their trust minimisation, and help protect the network from changes which

3.2 Bitcoin

47

might undermine their speculation and use of the tokens [48].

There are currently around 15,000 Bitcoin nodes distributed across the world. Since IT
engineer Stadicus released his Raspibolt guide in 2017 there has been an explosion of
small scale Bitcoin and Lightning node operators. Around thirty thousand Raspberry Pi
Lightning nodes (which are also by deﬁnition Bitcoin nodes) run one of a big selection of
open source distributions. We will build toward our own throughout the book.

3.2.3.7 Wallets, seeds, keys and BIP39

In all the cryptographic systems described in this book everything is derived from a private
key. This is an enormous number, and the input to the trapdoor function described earlier.
As usual, it’s beyond the scope of this book to ‘rehash’ the detail. Prof Bill Buchanan OBE
has a great post on the basic version of this process.

In modern wallets, private keys (and so too their public keys), and addresses, are
generated hierarchically. This is all part of BIP-0032. It starts with a single monstrously
large number of up to 512 bits. From this are crafted Hierarchical Deterministic (HD)
wallets, which use ‘derivation paths’ to make a tree of public/private key pairs, all seeded
from this ﬁrst number. This means that knowing the initial number, and the derivation path
applied to it (just another number), wallets can search down the tree of derivations and
ﬁnd all the possible addresses. In this way a whole group of active addresses belonging
to an entity can be held conveniently in one huge number (a concatenation of the input
and path). This is the seed. Seeds are even more conveniently abstracted into a mnemonic
called a seed phrase. Anyone interacting with these systems will see a 12 word (128 bits of
entropy which is considered to be ‘enough’) or 24 word (256 bit) seed phrase. That phrase
accesses the whole of the assets stored by that entity in the blockchain under it. A master
key. These seeds can be generated by hand with dice, remember it’s just a huge number
and the onward cryptography at play here.

An address in Bitcoin is derived from the public/private key pair. Again this is a one
way hash function. The public/private keys can’t be found from the address. Addresses
are really only a thing in wallets. They contain the element necessary to interact with
the UTXOs. Many UTXOs can reside under an address, in that they just share the same
keys. Wallets and nodes can monitor the blockchain to see transactions that ‘belong’ to
addresses owned by the wallet, then they can perform unlocking of those funds to move
them, through operations on the UTXOs via keys.

3.2.3.8 Custody

The topic of ‘custody’ of Bitcoin (addresses,UTXOs) can be confusing at ﬁrst. This is
another area where there’s a lot of detail available, but not all of it is appropriate because
increased complexity increases risk. Broadly though it’s important to remember that
ownership of a UTXO is passed around using signing keys, which are functions of wallets.
Wallets themselves don’t contain Bitcoin, they contain keys. The simplest approach is
a software wallet. This is an application on a device, which stores the private keys, and
manages signing of transactions which go onto the blockchain. It’s beyond the scope of
this book to review or suggest software in detail, but Bluewallet on mobile devices, and
Sparrow Wallet on desktop devices provide rich basic functionality if a reader wishes to
get started immediately. Note that these software wallets send your extended public key
(the path of those keys) to the wallet providers server, for the monitoring of the blockchain
to happen on it’s behalf. They’re updated by the software vendor, not the blockchain direct.
To get this to ‘privacy best practice’ commensurate with the aim of this book it’s necessary

3.3 Lightning (Layer 2)

48

Figure 3.14: Seedsigner is an inexpensive open source project which scans the master seed
in from a QR code to enable signing. One device can run a quorum based wallet (multisig).

to run a full node as detailed above, and connect the wallet software to that on a secure or
local connection.

So called Hardware wallets like Coldcard should perhaps be termed signing devices.
Rather than store Bitcoin they store the private key in a more secure way, in a device which
interacts with a computer or phone, or else they scan in the seed each time themselves as is
the case with opensource “seedsigner” (Figure 3.14).

For higher security it’s possible to combine hardware and software wallets (signing
devices) to provide a quorum of signatures required to move funds. More exotic still are
proposals like “Fedimint” which allows groups such as families or villages to leverage
their personal trust to co-manage Bitcoin. What is not/rarely secure is leaving Bitcoin with
a custodian such as an exchange as they simply issue you with an IOU and may abscond.
In building toward a proposal for a product in this book it would be simple for us to build
a metaverse which users simply paid to use. This is the norm up to now. Representative
money would ﬂow around in the metaverse and be changed back like game money at
some point. This is not what we wish to promote, so everything will be a variation on
“self-custody”, minimising third party trust for users.

3.3 Lightning (Layer 2)

Lightning was a 2016 proposal by Poon and Dryja [49], and is a method for networks of
channels of Bitcoin between parties, which can transfer value. The main public network
is a community driven liquidity pool which enables scaling and speed improvements for
the Bitcoin network. It makes Bitcoin more like money [50]. As with Bitcoin base chain

3.3 Lightning (Layer 2)

49

there are multiple standards and approaches, but within Lightning these are not necessarily
cross compatible with one another, resulting in several Lightning networks. This is to our
advantage as innovation is possible within these smaller networks. It is mainly ‘powered’
by thousands of volunteers who invest in hardware and lock up their Bitcoin in their nodes,
to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions. Zebka et al. found that although the network is
“fairly decentralised” it is more recently skewing to larger more established nodes [51].
Though this is a grassroots technology the nature of the design means it can likely be
trusted for small scale commercial applications.

The following text is from John Cantrell, an engineer who works on Lightning.
“The Lightning Network is a p2p network of payment channels. A payment channel is
a contract between two people where they commit funds using a single onchain tx. Once
the funds are committed they can make an unlimited amount of instant & free payments
over the channel. You can think of it as a tab where each person tracks how much money
they are owed. Each time a payment is made over the channel both parties update their
record of how much money each person has. These updates all happen off-chain and only
the parties involved know about them. When it‘s time to settle up the two parties can take
the ﬁnal balances of the channel and create a channel closing transaction that will be
broadcast on chain. This closing transaction sends each party the ﬁnal amounts they are
owed. This means for the cost of two on-chain transactions (the opening and closing of
the channel) two parties can transact an unlimited number of times and the overall cost of
each transaction approaches zero with every additional transaction they make over the
channel. Payment channels are a great solution for two parties to transact quickly and
cheaply but what if we want to be able to send money to anyone in the world quickly and
cheaply? This is where the Lightning Network comes into play, it‘s a p2p network of these
payment channels. This means if Alice has a payment channel with Bob and Bob has a
channel with Charlie that Alice can send a payment to Charlie with Bob‘s help. This idea
can be extended such that you can route a payment over an arbitrary number of channels
until you can reach the entire world. Routing a payment over multiple channels uses a
speciﬁc contract called a Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC). It introduces the ability for
Bob and any other nodes you route through to charge a small fee. These fees are typically
orders of magnitude smaller than onchain fees. This all sounds great but what if someone
tries to cheat? I thought the whole point of Bitcoin was that we no longer had to trust
anyone and it sure sounds like there must be some trust in our channel partners to use
the Lightning Network? The contracts used in Lightning are built to prevent fraud while
requiring no trust. There is a built-in penalty mechanism where if someone tries to cheat
and is caught then they lose all of their money. This does mean you need to be monitoring
the chain for fraud attempts.”

Lightning is a key scaling innovation in the bitcoin network at this time. It is seeing
rapid development and adoption (Figure 3.15). The popular payment app “Cash App”
integrates the technology, and ‘Lightning Strike’ services the USA, El Salvador, and
Argentina with zero exchange and transmission fees. It allows for unbound scaling of
transactions (millions of transations per second compared for instance to around 45,000
TPS in the VISA settlement network). Transaction costs are incredibly low, and the
transaction speed virtually instantaneous.

The most popular lightning software is LND from Lightning Labs or C-Lightning
from Blockstream. The software can be run on top of any Bitcoin full node, in a browser
extension with a limited node, in a mobile app as a client or a server, or a hybrid such as

the Greenlight server used by Breez wallet. Different trust implications ﬂow from these
choices.

3.3.1 Micropayments

Possibly the most important affordance of the Lightning network is the concept of micro-
payments, and streaming micropayments. It is very simple to transfer even one satoshi on
Lightning, which is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin, and a small fraction of a penny.
This can be a single payment, for a very small goods or service, or a recurring payment
on any cadence. This enables streaming payments for any service, or for remittance,
or remuneration. These use cases likely have enormous consequences which are just
beginning to be explored. Integration of this capability into metaverse applications will be
explored later.

3.3.2 BOLT12 and recurring payments

BOLT12 is a new and developing ’standard’ which simpliﬁes and extends the capability of
the network for recurring payments, but can negotiate single payments too. The example
keyring QR code seen in Figure 3.16 can be scanned to send single or recurring payments
securely and anonymously to the holder.

3.3.3 Fedimint and Fedi app

From the blog post on the Fedi App website; Fedimint is:

• a form of community Bitcoin custody,
• utilising federations (a byzantine fault tolerant multi-sig wallet technology similar to

3.3 Lightning (Layer 2)

52

Blockstream’s Liquid network),

• run collectively by groups of trusted community members we call “guardians”,
• for and on behalf of their communities,
• with privacy through Chaumian e-cash,
• and with close integration with the Lightning Network

Obi Nwosu sees Fedimint as the third vital pillar of the Bitcoin ecosystem. If Bitcoin
is secure decentralised money, and Lightning is decentralised payments, then he says
Fedimint is decentralised custody of the Bitcoin asset. The excitement in the community is
such that this protocol is included in our metaverse stack later. With Fediment a clade of
users within the metaverse would have near perfect transactional privacy within their group
inside the metaverse [8]. This could be a potentially huge group of users, and could include
AI actors in the scene. Transactions with the outside world could be through lightning as
already planned.

3.3.4 LNURL-auth

What is LNURL-auth? “LNURL-auth is a generic authentication protocol. It authenticates
the user using digital signatures, which means that the user needs to have a public-private
key pair. Thanks to the rising popularity of lightning wallets, more and more users are in
possession of and have easy access to such keys. Consequently, users are identiﬁed by their
public keys, nothing else. The protocol does not require any other identifying information
such as passwords, emails, usernames, or similar.”

LNURL-auth may be able to service all of our user management via LNBits.

3.3.5 LNBits

LNBits is an open source, extensible, Lightning ‘source’ management suite. It is self
hosted, and can connect to a variety of Lightning wallets, further abstracting the liquidity
to provide additional functionality to network users. Remember that all of these tools run
without a third party, on a £200 setup, hosted at home or within a business. The best way
to explore this is to describe some of the plugins.

• “Accounts System; Create multiple accounts/wallets. Run for yourself, friends/family,

or the whole world!”

• Events plugin allows QR code tickets to be created for an event, and for payments to

be taken for the tickets.

• Jukebox creates a Spotify based jukebox which can be deployed online or in physical

locations.

• Livestream provides an interface for online live DJ sets to receive real-time Lightning

tips, which can be split automatically in real-time with the music producer.

• TPoS, LNURLPoS & OfﬂineShop support online and ofﬂine point of sale (Figure

3.17).

• Paywall creates web access control for content.
• LightningTipBot is a custodial Lightning wallet and tip handling bot within the

popular on Telegram instant messenger service.

Together these plugins are incredibly useful primitives which are likely to be translatable
to a multi party metaverse application. A proposal for building a more speciﬁc plugin
along these lines is detailed later.

actor, with a key which is compatible with Nostr. This makes it the best choice and
it will likely form the core of the proposed metaverse stack.

3.4 Liquid federation (layer 2)

Liquid is an implementation on Blockstream Elements, and is itself part of the open source
development contribution of Blockstream, the company started by Adam Back (of hashcash
fame) and nearly a dozen other early cypherpunks and luminaries.

The Liquid side chain network, and it’s own attendant Lightning layer 2, is a fork of
Bitcoin with different network parameters. In liquid the user of the network ‘pegs’ into the
Bitcoin network, swapping tokens out from BTC to L-BTC (this can of course mean very
small subunits of 1 Bitcoin). Once tokens have been ‘locked’ and swapped to Liquid the
different network parameters used in the fork allow a different trust/performance trade-off.
Liquid is fast on the L1 chain, cheaper to use at this time, and more private. The consensus
achieved on this side chain network is faster because it is a far smaller group of node
operators. The next block to be written to the side chain is chosen by a node operated
by a member of a federation of dozens of major contributors to the Bitcoin technology
space. These ‘trusted’ nodes all check one another’s security and network operations,
meaning that the network is as secure as the aggregate of the trust placed in half of the
membership at any one time. There are still dozens of major companies, development
teams, and individual actors, with signiﬁcant reputational investment.

“Federation members contribute to the Liquid Network’s security, gain voting rights in
the board election and membership process, and provide valuable input on the development
of new features. Members also beneﬁt from the ability to perform a peg-out without a third
party, allowing their users to convert between L-BTC and BTC seamlessly within their
platform.”

Crucially for our purposes here Liquid allows tokenised asset transfer. Anyone can
issue an asset on Liquid. Such transfers of assets may be orders of magnitude cheaper than
on chain Bitcoin transactions, but still potentially orders of magnitude more expensive
than a simple Lightning transaction of value on the Bitcoin network.

Blockstream plan to add arbitrary (user generated) token support to their ‘Core Light-
ning’ implementation at some point. This would be a very strong choice for speciﬁc use
cases within an economically enabled metaverse application. When participants wish to
‘cash out’ of the Liquid network they must do this through one of the federation members
who activate the other side of the ‘two-way peg’, dispensing the equivalent amount of
Bitcoin. This is transparently handled through Blockstream’s “green wallet”.

All of this has the advantage of a far lower energy footprint compared to the main

chain, but it’s not quite ready with a full suite of affordances.

The Liquid network is being used as the underlying asset for a novel new global
ﬁnancial product. El Salvador are working with Blockstream to issue a nation state backed
bond.

3.5 Bitcoin Layer 3

Increasingly important features of modern blockchain implementations are programma-
bility through smart contracts, and issuance of arbitrary tokens. Assigning a transaction
to represent another thing like an economic unit, energy unit, or real world object, and

3.5 Bitcoin Layer 3

55

operating on those abstractions within the chain logic. Chief among these use cases are sta-
blecoins such as Tether, which are pegged to national currencies and described in the next
section. Bitcoin has always supported very limited contracts called scripts, and stablecoin
issuance has existed in Bitcoin since Omni Layer. Omni was the ﬁrst issuer of Tether, but
more recently these important features have passed to other layer one chains. This year is
likely to see the resurgence of this capability on Bitcoin, which of course beneﬁts from a
better security model. Once again, there is a stong assertion by some that this isn’t even
possible. The debate is complex and unresolved.

In order to properly understand the use of Bitcoin based technologies in metaverse

applications it is necessary to examine what these newer ‘layer 3’ ideas might bring.

3.5.1 LNP/BP and RGB

LNP/BP is a non proﬁt standards organisation in Switzerland which contributes to open
source development of Bitcoin layer 3 solutions into the Lightning protocol, and Bitcoin
protocol (LNP/BP). One of the core product developments within their work is the ‘RGB’
protocol, which is somewhat of a meaningless name, evolved from “coloured coins” which
were an early tokenised asset system on the Bitcoin network. RGB represents red, green,
and blue. The proposal is built upon research by Todd and Zucco. RGB is regarded as
arcane Bitcoin technology, even within the already rareﬁed Bitcoin developer communities.
Zucco provides the following explanation:

“When I want to send you a bitcoin, I will sign the transaction, I will give the transaction
only to you, you will be the only one verifying, and then we’ll take a commitment to this
transaction and that I will give only the commitment to miners. Miners will basically build
a blockchain of commitments, but without the actual validation part. That will be only
left to you. And when you want to send the assets to somebody else, you will pass your
signature, plus my signature, plus the previous signature, and so on.”

This is non-intuitive explanation of Todds ‘single-use-seals’, applied to Bitcoin, with
the purpose of underpinning arbitrary asset transfer secured by the Bitcoin network. In this
model the transacting parties are the exclusive holders of the information about what the
object they are transferring actually represents. This primitive can (and has) been expanded
by the LNP/BP group into a concept called ‘client side validation’. It’s appropriate to
explain this concept several times from different perspectives, because this is potentially a
profoundly useful technology for metaverse applications.

• A promise is made to spend a multi output transaction in the future. This establishes

the RGB relationships between the parties.

• One of the pubkeys to be spent to is known by both parties.
• The second output is unknown and is a combination of the hash of the state, and

schema, from the operation which has been performed.

• When the UTXO is spent the second spends pubkey can be processed against the
shared data blob to validate the shared state in a two party consensus (sort this out,
it’s nonsense).

• This is now tethered to the main chain. Some tokens from the issuance have gone to
the recipiant, and the remainder have gone back to the issuer. More tokens can be
issued in the same way from this pool.

• A token schema in the blob will show the agreed issuance and the history back to

the genesis for the token holder.

• The data blob contains the schema which is the key to RGB functions and the bulk

3.5 Bitcoin Layer 3

of the work and innovation.

56

• Each issuance must be veriﬁed on chain by the receiving party.

This leverages the single-use-seal concept to add in smart contracts, and more advanced
concepts to Bitcoin. Crucially, this is not conceptually the same as the highly expressive
‘layer one’ chains which offer this functionality within their chain logic. In those systems
there is a globally available shared consensus of ‘state’. In the LNP/BP technologies the
state data is owned, controlled, and stored by the transacting parties. Bitcoin provides the
crytographic external proof of a state change in the event of a proof being required. This is
an elegant solution in that it takes up virtually no space on the blockchain, is private by
design, and is extensible to layer 2 protocols like Lightning.

This expanding ecosystem of client side veriﬁed proposals is as follows:
• RGB smart contracts
• RGB assets are fungible tokens on Bitcoin L1 and L2, and non fungible Bitcoin L1

(and somewhat on L2).

• Bifrost is an extension to the Lightning protocol, with it’s own Rust based node
implementation, and backwards compatibility with other nodes in the network. This
means it can transparently participate in normal Lightning routing behaviour with
other peers. Crucially however it can also negotiate passing the additional data for
token transfer between two or more contiguous Bifrost enabled parties. This can
be considered an additional network liquidity problem on top of Lightning, and
is the essence of the “Layer 3” moniker associated with LNP/BP. It will require a
great number of such nodes to successfully launch token transfer on Lightning. As a
byproduct of it’s more ‘protocol’ minded design decisions Bifrost can also act as
a generic peer-to-peer data network, enabling features like Storm ﬁle storage and
Prometheus.

• AluVM is a RISC based virtual machine (programmable strictly in assembly) which
can execute Turing complete complex logic, but only outputs a boolean result which
is compliant with the rest of the client side validation system. In this way a true or
false can be returned into Bitcoin based logic, but be arbitrarily complex within the
execution by the contract parties.

• Contractum is the proposed smart contract language which will compile the RGB20
contracts within AluVM (or other client side VMs) to provide accessible layer 3
smart contracts on Bitcoin. It is a very early proposal at this stage.

• Internet2: “Tor/noise-protocol Internet apps based on Lightning secure messaging
• Storm is a lightly speciﬁed escrow-based bitcoin data storage layer compliant with

Lightning through Bifrost.

• Prometheus is a lightly speciﬁed multiparty high-load computing framework.
Really, any compute problem can be considered applicable to client side validation. In
simplest terms a conventional computational problem is solved, and the cryptographically
veriﬁable proof of this action, is made available to the stakeholders, on the Bitcoin ledger.
Less prosaically, at this stage of the project the more imminent proposed affordances
of LNP/BP are described in ‘schema’ on the project github. The most interesting to the
technically minded layperson are:

• RGB20 fungible assets. This could be stablecoins like dollar or pounds representa-
tion. This is a huge application area for Bitcoin, and similar to Omni, which will
also be covered next.

• RGB21 for nonfungible tokens and ownership rights. In principle BiFrost allows

3.5 Bitcoin Layer 3

57

these to be transferred over a the Lightning network, signiﬁcantly lowering the
barrier to entry for this whole technology. DIBA have this technology working on
testnet.

• RGB22 may provide a route to identity proofs. This is covered in detail later.
Federico Tenga is CEO of ‘Chainside’ and an educator and consultant in the space. He has
written an up-to-date “primer”, which is still extremely complex for the uninitiated, but
does capture how the RGB token transfer system works. That medium article also touches
on Taro, which is next.

3.5.2 Taro

Taro is an very new initiative by Lightning Labs to allow assets to transmit on the Lightning
network. It is more similar to RGB above than Omnibolt below. They say: “Taro enables
bitcoin to serve as a protocol of value by allowing app developers to integrate assets
alongside BTC in apps both on-chain and over Lightning. This expands the reach of
Lightning Network as a whole, bringing more users to the network who will drive more
volume and liquidity in bitcoin, and allowing people to easily transfer ﬁat for bitcoin in
their apps. More network volume means more routing fees for node operators, who will see
the beneﬁts of a multi-asset Lightning Network without needing to support any additional
assets.”

The project has clearly been under development by the lead developer at Lightning Labs
for some years and seems both capable and mature, though they are obviously following
the model of ‘co-opting’ open source ideas (from RGB) to garner venture capital funding.
They credit RGB in the github. More will doubtless be added to this section and it seems a
contender for our metaverse purposes, being less broadly ambitious than RGB upon which
it’s based, but perhaps more focused and implemented. The key feature of Taro seems to
be that only the ﬁrst and last hop in a multi-hop lightning transaction need to support Taro,
because of external data validation databases called “universes”. This is an advance on the
RGB proposal. The technical specs are now on the lightning labs web pages, and code has
been released.

3.5.3 Spacechains

Spacechains is a proposal by Ruben Somsen. It is a way to provide the functionality of any
conceivable blockchain, by making it a sidechain to Bitcoin.

Like RGB described earlier it’s a single use seal, but which can be closed by the highest

bidder.

In a spacechain the Bitcoin tokens are destroyed in order to provably create the new
spacechains tokens at a 1:1 value. These new tokens only have worth moving forward
within the new chain ecosystem they represent, as they cannot be changed back. They
nontheless have the same security guarantees as the bticoin main chain, though with a
radically reduced ecological footprint (x1000?), and higher performance. Each ‘block’ in
the new chain is a single bitcoin transaction. The high level features are:

• Outsource mining to BTC with only a single tx per block on the main chain.
• One way peg, Bitcoin is burnt to create spacechain tokens.
• Allows permissionless chain creation, without a speculative asset.
• Fee bidding BMM is space efﬁcient and incentive compatible. Miners just take the

highest fees as normal.

3.6 Risks and mitigations

58

• Paul Sztorc raised the idea
• It’s best with a soft fork but possible without

The concept is explained fully in a recent presentation at Advancing Bitcoin conference.

3.5.4 Statechains, drivechain, softchains

There are many proposals for layer 2 scaling solutions for the bitcoin network. Ruben
Somsen describes Softchains, Stateschains, and Spacechains, while Drivechain is described
by the author Paul Sztorc on the project web pages and is split across BIP-0300 for
drivechain and BIP-0301 for a “blind merge mining”, a soft fork which it’s unlikely to get.
They are all hypothetical with the exception of sidechains.

3.6 Risks and mitigations

Looking across the whole sector, this paragraph from the Bank of International Settlement
(BIS) sums everything up:

“...it is now becoming clear that crypto and DeFi have deeper structural limitations
that prevent them from achieving the levels of efﬁciency, stability or integrity required for an
adequate monetary system. In particular, the crypto universe lacks a nominal anchor, which
it tries to import, imperfectly, through stablecoins. It is also prone to fragmentation, and
its applications cannot scale without compromising security, as shown by their congestion
and exorbitant fees. Activity in this parallel system is, instead, sustained by the inﬂux of
speculative coin holders. Finally, there are serious concerns about the role of unregulated
intermediaries in the system. As they are deep-seated, these structural shortcomings are
unlikely to be amenable to technical ﬁxes alone. This is because they reﬂect the inherent
limitations of a decentralised system built on permissionless blockchains.”

This might seem like reason enough to stop here and wait for proper digital currency
(expanded later), but Bitcoin is here now, is likely unstoppable in, and with mitigations in
place might have uses if developed properly. Perhaps surprising the same BIS is allowing
up to 1% of bank reserves to be held in crypto assets, including Bitcoin, according to their
June 2022 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision report.

Lightning is still considered to be experimental and not completely battle tested. There
have been various attacks and a major double spend attack may be possible [52], but there
have been no major problems in the years it’s been running with careful design choices
and cybersecurity best practice it it likely a production ready component of our planning.

3.6.1 Digital assets

For digital assets more generally it is useful to look at the recent “whole government
executive order” signed by President Biden early in 2022. It was mainly framed in terms of
“responsible innovation, and leadership” in the new space. The resulting, “Comprehensive
Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets” is a product of multi agency
collaboration and can be seen as 9 reports and a summary document, and has been long
anticipated. The summary itself is neither particularly comprehensive nor a framework,
and mainly serves to identiﬁes high level risks, aspirations, and challenges, and strongly
hints toward eventual development of a “digital dollar” (CBDC, expanded later).

The risks section of the original executive order shows how legislators are framing this,

so it’s useful to break down here.

3.6 Risks and mitigations

59

• Consumer and business protections. This is likely to pertain to custodians and is

much needed. Misselling is rife. Security presents a challenge.

• Systemic risk, and market integrity are a concern. The legislators clearly worry

about contagion risks from the sector.

• Illicit ﬁnance (criminality and sanction busting etc) are a concern, but not particularly
front and centre[53]. Criminality in 2021 was a mere 0.15% of transactions according
to Chainalysis, but this number varies year to year. There are claims that Iran have
begun ofﬁcial overseas buying with cryptocurrencies, but again, the numbers are
small. One of the better sections of the work is the US treasury department’s recently
published ‘National Risk Assessments for Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing,
and Proliferation Financing’. This is a comprehensive report and speaks to careful
research across the space. It is broken into three parts. Perhaps surprisingly, while
they do see activity in these areas, they do not rate the risk as very signiﬁcant. Cash
remains the main problem for illicit funding. There is some talk that the nature of
public blockchain analysis allows greater oversight of these tools and that this is to
the advantage of government and civil enforcement agencies.

• Highlighting the need for international coordination suggests they are mindful of
jurisdictional arbitrage. The partial regulatory capture of these technologies, where
activity ﬂows to globally more lenient legislative regimes, continues to be a concern.
Many of the centralised exchanges for instance are located in tax havens such as
Malta. As the world catches up with these products it is likely that this will be
smoothed out.

• Climate goals, diversity, equality and inclusion are mentioned. It seems that the
“environment” aspect of ESG is more important then “social” and “governance” at
this time.

• Privacy and human rights are mentioned.
• Energy policy is highlighted, including grid management and reliability, energy

efﬁciency incentives and standards, and sources of energy supply.

The latest summary report resulting from the above guidance actually adds little tangible
meat to the bones. This possibly reﬂects the complexity of these issues. The recom-
mendations seem to be broadly as follows, and are really a copy/paste of the executive
order.

• Carry on doing research into central bank digital currencies, but there’s no particular

rush.

• Support development of better instant payment methods both at home and globally.
• Ensure consumer and systemic protections.
• More monitoring, civil and criminal prosecutions.
• Issue more rules and clarity in response to risks (this is actually likely net positive as

rules are currently unclear).

• Improve global reporting on users (KYC/AML).

The government rhetoric to date in the USA can be seen to be converging on an under-
standing of the technology, at different rates in different parts of government. One thing
that seems to shine through is their own perception of their global leadership on legislation
on these matters. They seems to assume that what they decide will guide the world, and
this may be true through their KYC/AML pressures.

A recent proposed bi-partisan bill in the USA will likely lead global law in digital
assets if it is passed in the next year or two. It encourages the use of Bitcoin as a medium

3.6 Risks and mitigations

60

of exchange by applying a tax exemption on transactions of less than $200. The issue
of whether an asset is a commodity (a raw material thing) or a security (a promise) is
left to a couple of major government agencies to unpick, with corresponding reporting
requirements. Crucially for this book these nascent bills all regard both Bitcoin and
Ethereum as sufﬁciently decentralised to qualify as commodities, meaning they would
enjoy more lenient oversight. In this line of policy, exchanges will be required to do far
more reporting, and would be penalised for trading against their customers. DOAs and
DeFi are the big potential losers. In a maddening twist the Ofﬁce of Government Ethics in
the USA has banned anyone who owns digital assets from working on the legislation. This
is an exceptional move and likely to result in poorly crafted laws in the ﬁrst instance.

The most recent and troubling example is the US ban on any Ethereum assets which
have been through a “mixer service” that obfuscates history. This is a huge constraint
on the code and smart contract itself, not just sanctions against individuals. It has ‘free
speech’ and constitutional implications [54]. More such actions and arrests of developers
are feared. It has led to Circle (who issue the USDC stablecoin) blacklisting every address
sanctioned by the US government. Centrally issued digital assets are obviously neither
uncensorable nor permissionless. This intersects (again) with the whole question of what
decentralisation means and how effective it can be in it’s stated goal of circumventing
global policies.

3.6.2 Bitcoin speciﬁcally

In addition it’s useful for this document to focus more on the technical challenges to the
Bitcoin network.

• The block reward is reduced every 4 years (epochs). This means a portion of the
mining reward is trending to zero, and nobody knows what effect this will have on
the incentives for securing the network through proof of work [55]. It is increasingly
being discussed as the major eventual problem for the network.

• Stablecoins are a vital transitional technology (described later) but do not meaning-

fully exist yet on the Bitcoin network. This may change.

• Bitcoin lacks privacy by design. All transactions are publicly viewable. This is a
major drag to the concept of BTC as a money. Upgrade of the network is possible,
and has indeed been achieved for a Bitcoin fork called Litecoin [56].

• The Lightning network (described later) has terrible UX design at this time.
• The basic ‘usability’ of the network is still poor in the main. Any problems which
users experience demand a steep learning curve and risk loss of funds. There is
obviously no technical support number people can call.

• Only around one billion unspent transactions can be generated a year on the network.
This means that it might become impossible for everyone on the planet to have their
own Bitcoin address (with it’s associated underpinning UTXO).

• Chip manufacture is concentrated in only a few companies and countries, as identiﬁed

by Matthew Pines.

• Potential constraints on monetary policy ﬂexibility.
• Future protocol changes.
• Unanticipated effects on the domestic and international energy system.
• Vulnerability to adversary attacks are widely studied[57, 58, 59], and still pretty
much completely speculative because of the complex nature of the attack surface.
• Mining tends toward economy of scale concentration. Many are already on their

3.6 Risks and mitigations

61

own specialised network to connect to one another.

• Future hard forks. There will doubtless be pressure to fork the code to add inﬂation,
or ESG mitigations, or to ﬁx the UNIX clock issue in 2106. Each fork is a risk.

• Other unknown, unanticipated risks given Bitcoin’s limited 13-year history.

4. Money in the real world

It is necessary here to brieﬂy examine what money actually is in the world outside of
metaverses, so we can understand it in the context of a virtual global space. In the previous
section Bitcoin can be viewed in a couple of different lights. As a self custody digital
bearer asset it can be viewed as ‘property’, like gold, i.e. not a liability on someone else’s
asset sheet. Indeed this has long been one of the assertions of the community and it ﬁnds
favour in law, possible most ironically in China which of course banned mining. ‘Money’
though is a far more slippery concept to grasp. It seems very likely that Bitcoin is evolving
as a “base money”, and it’s important to deﬁne that, but there are many other kinds of
money within the online world which can potentially transfer value within virtual social
spaces.

4.1 Deﬁning money

Money is an economic good, that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange. This sim-
ple and speciﬁc description doesn’t do justice to the complexity of everything that humans
consider to be money. Even the Encyclopaedia Britannica strays from this immediately in
their deﬁnition:

“money, a commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange.
It is the medium in which prices and values are expressed; as currency, it circulates
anonymously from person to person and country to country, thus facilitating trade, and it
is the principal measure of wealth.”.
In which it can be seen that the principle measure of wealth might not be money at all, but
rather property, credit, etc. So are these things money? Is a promise on a ledger money?
The assertion at the top of this section is challenged by different schools of economic
thinking. Global debt is around an order of magnitude larger than base money, and most
wealth is stored in illiquid land/built environment (some $300T), and yet the system seems
to work ﬁne. The debt theory of money offered by anthropologist David Graeber suggests
that money is an abstraction of barter, and thereby ‘credit’, but credit clearly pre-dates
money, and needs no barter, commodity, intermediary nor underlying asset [60]. This
suggests that money is something slightly different.

Money seems to have evolved for two principle purposes; trade outside of a village

4.1 Deﬁning money

63

context, and inheritance [61]. In doing this it somewhat replaced and augmenting ‘credit’,
which as said above, was a promise between parties based on future actions, and likely as
old as rudimentary language itself.

Money can be divided into two categories, which are fungible (interchangeable) from
the point of view of the users. Base money is ‘commodity’ money which is backed by
assets, or tangible physical (or digital) goods through the actions of a central bank ledger,
and is around $30-$40T. Everything else is ‘ﬁduciary media’ [62].

All ﬁduciary money is credit but not all credit is ﬁduciary money. Nobody knows the
extent of the global supply of ﬁduciary media. It encapsulates all the new digital money
platforms like PayPal, gift cards, offshore accounts and all manner of other vehicles, and is
thought to be many tens of trillions of pounds. This somewhat muddies the waters since
money that is backed by ‘something’ blends away into money which cannot reasonably
be assayed. This in turn undermines the assertion that money is backed. It seems that
a combination of available raw materials and labour, central banks and their associated
political structures [63], and global markets drive the value of money up and down relative
to “stuff” in the shops. This manifests as ‘inﬂation’, which is ‘possibly’ the effect of not
pegging money to an asset such as silver, or gold as in the past [64]. While the gross
drivers of inﬂation seems to be accepted and understood, nobody seems very sure how
the various aspects interact.It may be that central banks actually have no decent response
to global monetary pressures and are overdue a paradigm shift, as explained by Daniela
Gabor (Professor of economics and macroﬁnance at UWE Bristol):
“...last stage of a central banking paradigm, when it implodes under the contradictions of
its class politics? Under the ﬁnancial capitalism supercycle of the past decades, inﬂation-
targeting central banks have been outposts of (ﬁnancial) capital in the state, guardians of
a distributional status-quo that destroyed workers’ collective power while building safety
nets for shadow banking.
The limits of this institutional arrangement that concentrates (pricing) power and proﬁt in
(a few) corporate hands are now plain to see. If the climate and geopolitical of 2022 are
omens of Isabel Schnabel’s Great Volatility that most central banks and pundits expect for
the near future, then macro-ﬁnancial stability requires new framework for co-ordination
between central banks and Treasuries that can support a state more willing to, and capable
of, disciplining capital.
But such a framework would threaten the privileged position that central banks have had
in the macro-ﬁnancial architecture and in our macroeconomic models. The history of
central banking teaches us that policy paradigms die when they cannot offer a useful
framework for stabilising macroeconomic conditions, but never at the hands of central
bankers themselves.”

All this makes it hard to ﬁnd a universally accepted and explicable deﬁnition of money.
The best approach may be to look at the properties of a thing which is asserted to be a
money. In his book ‘A history of money’, Glyn Davies identiﬁes “cognisability, utility,
portability, divisibility, indestructibility, stability of value, and homogeneity” [65].

Stroukal examines Bitcoins’ likely value as a money from an Austrian economics
perspective and identiﬁes “portability, storability, divisibility, recognizability, homogeneity
and scarcity” [66].

A helpfully brief and useful web page by Desjardins from 2015 describes some proper-

ties and explains them in layman’s terms below:

• Divisible: Can be divided into smaller units of value.

4.1 Deﬁning money

64

• Fungible: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
• Portable: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
• Durable: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
• Acceptable: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
• Uniform: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing

power.

• Limited in Supply: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain

relatively constant.

4.1.1 Global currency interactions

The legacy moniker “third world” came from a division of the world along economic lines
[67]. At the time this was the petrodollar / neo-institutional hegemony [68, 69], vs the
economic superpower of the soviet block, and then ‘the rest’; unaligned economic powers.
This old framework has fallen away with the associated terminology, but it’s useful to
look at what money ‘is’ from a global viewpoint, because all money is effectively trust in
the liability held by some deﬁned counter party.

Right now the dollar system is still predominant, but it seems likely that there are new
axes forming, especially around the Chinese Yuan. It’s clear that central banks have been
aware of this potential transition away from a global dollar / energy system. The Dollar
has potentially suffered from the radical expansion of the money supply over the last 70
years or so under the private “Eurodollar” system [70]. Some policy makers have been
looking back to the great economist John Maynard Keynes’ ideas for a neutral basket of
assets as a global synthetic hedgemonic currency [71, 72] which would almost certainly
consist partly of gold [73].

Use of the dollar system has recently been shown more and more to be contingent on
adherence to US deﬁned political principles. This is evidenced most starkly by the seizure
of Russian central bank foreign reserves, a new and untried projection of monetary power.
The Chinese Yuan/Renminbi is potentially stepping in where the petrodollar is now
waning [74]. The effects of this expansion of economic inﬂuence by China, through a
potential petro-Yuan, and the belt and road initiative [75], are not yet felt, but the lines are
fairly clearly deﬁned. The Euro system is potentially more stable, and less ‘weaponised’ but
comes with it’s own restrictions for use, especially through the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). It is notable for instance that the IMF have included a clause in their negotiations
with Argentina to ‘discourage’ the use of crypto based money, leading to a complete ban
on banks offering the products only days after they began. This is likely a response to the
adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador, something with which the IMF is very uncomfortable.
They are also wary of the ability of nation states to monetise their energy reserves without
the need for export markets. They do however concede that CBDCs and ‘some’ crypto
assets may be more energy efﬁcient than traditional systems. It seems to industry insiders
that they are learning in public.

The new ‘third world’ who are excluded from the Dollar and/or Yuan poles of the global
economy might drift toward the ‘basket of assets’ discussed by Keynes and Carney above.
As mentioned this will certainly have a component of gold, and likely other commodity
assets such as rare metals. For our purposes here it’s also possible that there would be
a small ‘hedge’ allocation of Bitcoin or even a global axis of ‘unaligned’ nations using
the asset [76]. Block and Wakeﬁeld research found that in developed nations Bitcoin is
treated as in investment, while in less wealthy demographics there is interest in the utility.

4.2 International money transfer networks

65

This is evidenced in the early nation state adoption seen and described to date, and the
game theory incentive explained by Fidelity in the introduction. It’s too early to tell if this
‘unaligned money’ could constitute a global economic pole, but it’s interesting that some
commentators are now even discussing this, and that carbon neutrality research is being
undertaken speciﬁcally for this application.

4.2 International money transfer networks

Transferring money from one ﬁnancial jurisdiction to another is itself a global marketplace
which has accreted over the entire course of human history. It’s far less useful here to
discuss the mythos of salt and seashells as a mechanisms of international remittance
and taxation [77, 78]. Sufﬁce it to say that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of cross
border payment companies who make their business from taking a percentage cut of an
international money transfer. There are also hundreds if not thousands of banks who offer
this service as part of their core business portfolio. This section looks at some of the major
players, and their mechanism, to contextualise the more recent shifts brought about by
technology.

4.2.1 Swift, ISO 20022, and correspondence banking

Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communiactions (SWIFT) was initially formed
in 1973 between 239 banks across 15 countries. They needed a way to improve handling
of cross border payments. It is now the global standard for ﬁnancial message exchange in
over 200 countries, and has recently found itself under a fresh spotlight, during the invasion
of Ukraine. The system handles around 40 million short, secure, code transmissions a
day, which represent crucial data about a transaction and the parties involved. It is used
by both banks and major ﬁnancial institutions to speed up settlement between themselves,
on behalf of the clients and customers. It replaced the Telex (wire transfer) system. The
new proposed and incoming standard to replace SWIFT is ISO20022 which is a complex
and data rich arrangement. To be clear the SWIFT consortium are promoting this new
standard to their 11,000 plus global user base, and there is signiﬁcant investment and hype
from major ﬁnancial players, but it seems unclear what the actual take-up will or even
should be. A group of ‘crytocurrencies’ are heavily involved in the ISO20022 standard,
and there’s been experimentation with private permissioned distributed ledger technologies.
It’s actually somewhat unclear what value they bring, and possible that the relationship
of these public ledgers to international bank to bank messaging is a marketing distraction.
Note that SWIFT, ISO20022, and the associated tokens within crypto are all themselves
products which have a business model. They are all intermediaries which will demand a
mediating fee somewhere. All of this proposed functionality could be replaced by central
bank digital currencies, which will be discussed later in the section.

4.2.4 Digital disruptive ﬁntech

It seems that the neobank providers of digital banking apps are likely to converge with
native digital asset “wallets”. This is also the thesis advanced by the Ark intestments Big
Ideas paper.

CNN have a useful primer of the most prevalent mobile digital payment methods. This
can be seen in Figure 4.1. This comparison makes it pretty clear that Bitcoin is not ready
as a personal mobile payment system. That’s not to say that there isn’t a place for the
underlying technology in global payment processing. The most interesting example of this
is Strike, a product in the international ﬁntech arena. It is a ‘global’ money transmitter
which uses bank connections in local currencies, but a private version of the Lightning
network with settlement on the Bitcoin main chain. In practice users connect the app to
their bank and can send money to the bank connected Strike app of another user instantly,
and without a fee. This is a far better product than those previously available. In principle
it’s open API allows many more applications to be integrated into the Strike back end.
Twitter already uses this for international tipping (and remittance). It seems that this is
a perfect contender for supporting transactions in open metaverse applications, and that
may be true, but Strike is currently only available in three countries (USA, El Salvador,
Argentina).

4.2.5 Stablecoins

Stablecoins are ‘crypto like’ instruments which are ‘pegged’ at a 1:1 ratio with nationally
issued Fiat currencies. In fact they usually correspond to units of privately issued debt
underwritten by a variety of different assets. This is (depending on the issuing company’s
model) a far more risky unit of money than the nominal currency that they represent,
but they offer signiﬁcant utility. They allow the user to self custody the cryptographic
bearer instrument representing the money themselves, as with blockchain. This may afford
the user less friction in that they can transmit the instrument through the newer ﬁnancial
rails which are emerging. Once again, this is likely a product most useful to emerging
markets, those living under oppressive regimes, currencies suffering from high inﬂation,
and countries who rely on the dollar as their currency, and within digitally native metaverse
applications. These are enormous global uses though. The use in the west is prominently
for ‘traders’ on exchanges at this time. /par The caveat of such products is that such ‘units’
of money can be frozen by the issuer, and they are subject to the third party risk of the
issuer defaulting on the underlying instrument, instantly wiping out the value.

Klages-Mundt et al. wrote a paper in 2020, which explains the details of the different

mechanisms and risks.

The following text paraphrases Spencer noon of on-chain analytics company “Our-
Network”, who provides an useful summary of the paper. There are two major classes of
stablecoins:

• Custodial: entrusted by off-chain collateral assets like ﬁat dollars that sit in a bank.

Requires trust in third party.

• Non-custodial (aka decentralized): fully on-chain and backed by smart contracts &

economics. No trusted parties.

In custodial stablecoins, custodians hold a combination of assets (currencies, bonds,
commodities, etc.) off-chain, allowing issuers (possibly the same entity) to offer digital

4.2 International money transfer networks

67

Figure 4.1: Comparison of mobile based payment systems

4.2 International money transfer networks

68

tokens of an reserve asset. The top 2 custodial stablecoins today are USDT and USDC.
There are 3 types of custodial stablecoins.

• Reserve Fund: 100% reserve ratio. Each stablecoin is backed by a unit of the reserve
asset held by the custodian. A useful example of this the USDF banking consortium.
• Fractional Reserve Fund: The stablecoin is backed by a mix of both reserve assets

and other capital assets.

• Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): A digital form of central bank money that
is widely available to the general public. CBDCs are in their nascency as today only
9 countries/territories have launched them, many of them small.

Custodial stablecoins have three major risks:

• Counterparty Risk (fraud, theft, govt seizure, etc.)
• Censorship Risk (operations blocked by regulators, etc.)
• Economic Risk (off-chain assets go down in value)

Each can result in the stablecoin value going to zero.

It’s worth taking a look at these tokens individually, to get a feel for the trade-offs,
and ﬁgure out how they might be useful for us in our proposed metaverse applications.
It’s important to know that these tokenised dollars and/or other currencies are issued on
top of the public blockchains we have been detailing throughout. Which tokens are on
what blockchains is constantly evolving, so it’s not really worth enumerating speciﬁcs.
In a metaverse application it would be necessary to manage both the underlying public
blockchain and the stablecoin issued on top of it, making the interaction with the global
ﬁnancial system perversely more not less complex. In the following list of a few of the
major coins, the ﬁrst hyperlink is the whitepaper if it’s available.

• Tether is the largest of the stablecoins, with some $70B in circulation, and the third
largest ‘crypto’. This has been a meteoric rise, attracting the ire and scrutiny of
regulators and investigators. There is considerable doubt that Tether has sufﬁcient
assets backing their synthetic dollars, but the market seems not to mind. It’s resilience
against ‘bank runs’ was tested in May 2022 when $9B was redeemed directly for
dollars in a few days following the UST crash (more on this later), and they have
been shoring up their position since by reducing exposure and size. It might be that
the market comes to see this event as a validation of the asset. They are shortly to
launch a GBP version for the UK. It’s an important technology for this metaverse
conversation because of intersections with Bitcoin through the Lightning network.
Tether might actually provide everything needed. It’s only as safe as the trust invested
in the central issuer though.

• Binance USD is the dollar equivalent token from global crypto exchange behemoth
Binance. It’s released in partnership with Paxos, who have a strong record for
compliance, and transparency. Paxos also offer USDP. Both these stablecoins claim
to be 100% backed by dollars, or US treasuries. They are regulated under the more
restrictive New York state ﬁnancial services and have a monthly attestation report.
• MakerDAO Dai is an Ethereum based stablecoin and one of the older offerings.
It’s been ‘governed’ by a DAO since 2014. ‘Excess collateral’, above the value of
the dai-dollars to be minted, is voted upon before being committed to the systems’
cryptographic ‘vaults’ as a backing for the currency. These dai can then be used
across the Ethereum network. Despite the problems with DAOs, and the problems
with Ethereum, DAI is well liked by its community of users and has a healthy billion
dollars of issuance. They may be dangerously exposed to the new crackdown in the

4.2 International money transfer networks

69

USA, and there is internal talk of pro-actively abandoning DAI altogether.

• TrueUSD claims to be fully backed by US dollars, held in escrow. It runs on the
Ethereum blockchain. They have attestation reports available on demand and claim
fully insured deposits. It’s not quite that simple in that a portion of the backing is
‘cash equivalents’.

• Gemini GUSD claim reserves are “held and maintained at State Street Bank and
Trust Company and within a money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, invested only in U.S. Treasury obligations.” which seems pretty clear.
• TerraUSD (UST) was a newer and more experimental stablecoin, and one of a
set of currency representations within the network. It worked in concert with the
LUNA token on the Cosmos blockchain in order to keep it’s dollar stability. It was
not backed in the same way as the other tokens, instead relying on an arbitrage
mechanism using LUNA. In essence the protocol paid users to destroy LUNA and
mint UST when the price was above one dollar, and vice versa. This theoretically
maintained the dollar peg. There was much concern that this model of ‘algorithmic
stable coin’ is unstable [79]. The developers of the Terra tried to address this concern
by buying enormous amounts of Bitcoin, which they quickly had to employ to address
UST drifting downward from $1. This failed to address the ‘great depegging’, with
LUNA crashing to essentially zero, destroying some $50B of capital. It will now
likely act as a cautionary tale to other institutions considering Bitcoin as a ‘reserve
asset’. An earlier version of this book highlighted the speciﬁc variation of the risk
which quickly manifested.

• USDC is a dollar backed coin issued by a consortium of major players in the space,
most notably Circle, and Coinbase. It’s has a better transparency record than tether
but is still not backed 1:1 by actual dollars in reserve. It may or may not be a fractional
reserve asset. It’s well positioned to take advantage of regulatory changes in the
USA, and seems to be quietly lobbying to be the choice of a government endorsed
digital dollar, at least a signiﬁcant part of a central bank digital currency initiative.
It’s too early to tell how this will work out, but it has substantial ‘legacy ﬁnance
backing’. It is the only stablecoin to increase slightly in value (depegging upward)
in the wake of the UST implosion. This ‘ﬂight to quality’ shows the advantage of
the work that CENTRE put into regulatory compliance. If our metaverse were to
pick a stablecoin to work with it would be USDC. It runs on Ethereum, Algorand,
Solana, Stellar, Tron, Hedera, Avalanche and Flow blockchains. At this time USDC
may be under speculative attack by Chinese exchange Binance, in favour of their
own offering BUSD.

.

4.2.5.1 The evolving US position

In most regards the legislative front line is happening in the USA. Treasury Secretary
Yellen responded to the collapse of Terra/UST saying that: “A comprehensive regulatory
framework for US dollar stablecoins is needed”. She also said that the stablecoin market
is too small to pose systemic risk at this time. This is clearly an evolving situation, but
the incredible consumer exposure to these risky products is likely to elicit a swift and
signiﬁcant response, and the timing seems right for intervention. The markets suggest that
USDC will be the eventual winner.

Koning meanwhile has looked into the different regulatory approaches used by various

4.2 International money transfer networks

70

stablecoins.

• The highly regulated New York state ﬁnancial framework (Paxos, Gemini)
• Piggyback off of a (Nevada) state-chartered trust [TrueUSD, HUSD]
• Get dozens of money transmitter licenses [USDC]
• Stay offshore [Tether]
New legislation speciﬁc to the concept of stablecoins is now entering the system under
Sen Toomey. There are many provisions in the bill, mostly pertaining to convertibility and
the ever present problem of attestation of the ‘backing’ of these products. Mention has
already been made of the major bill advanced by Sen. Lummis and Gillibrand. This bill
also includes signiﬁcant provision around stablecoins. Lummis said “Stablecoins will have
to be either FDIC insured or more than 100% backed by hard assets.”. This is good news
for this section of the digital asssets space.

Crucially there is also more clarity on privacy. This is a huge threat from digital money

systems, and the USA is likely to lead. Remember though that none of this is yet law.

Valkenburg, the lead researcher of a US think tank in digital assets says the following:
“Stablecoin TRUST Act, is a discussion draft mostly about stablecoins, but it also has
important privacy protections for crypto users broadly: it puts real limits on warrantless
surveillance by narrowing what info can be collected from third parties. Last summer we
fought a provision in the infrastructure bill that damaged the privacy of crypto users by
expanding the broker deﬁnition (who needs to report information about transactions to
the IRS) & crypto 6050I reporting (reports on business transactions over $10,000). The
winter before we fought and successfully delayed a rushed proposal from the outgoing
Trump administration to mandate that exchanges collect information about persons who
are not their customers, who hold crypto at addresses in wallets they control directly.
the Stablecoin TRUST Act would stop these encroachments, constrain the treasury from
collecting any nonpublic information unless they get a search warrant or collect only
information voluntarily provided to an exchange by a customer and for a legitimate
business purpose. If “voluntarily provided for a legitimate business purpose” sounds
familiar to you, that’s b/c it’s the constitutional standard articulated by the Court in
Carpenter describing LIMITED circumstances where warrantless searches of customer
data are ok.It’s the standard we’ve advocated must also limit warrantless data collection
at crypto exchanges. If exchanges must collect information about non-customers, that
information is, by deﬁnition, not voluntarily provided for a legitimate business purpose.”

4.2.5.2 The evolving UK position

As mentioned brieﬂy in the introduction the UK has recently signalled an enthusiasm for
stablecoins as “means of payment”. This is a stark reversal of their previous legislative
momentum is possibly a response to the tightening of rhetoric in Europe around such
assets. The Financial Services and Markets Bill. became law in July 2022. An excerpt
pertaining to stablecoins can be seen in Figure 4.2.

The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, outlined the
FCA’s regulatory goals at the Peterson Institute for International Economics: “The U.S.
and U.K. will deepen ties on crypto-asset regulation and market developments — including
in relation to stablecoins and the exploration of central bank digital currencies.”

The timing seems right to explore the use of stablecoins in metaverse applications up

the list of choices.

4.3 Central bank digital currencies

71

Figure 4.2: The UK signs into law regulation of digital representatives of value

4.2.5.3 Stables in metaverse applications

It makes a lot of sense to consider stablecoin transfer as the money in metaverses. USDC
is furthest along this possible adoption curve. Their partnership with global payment
provider Stripe has enabled global dollar transfer within Twitter for users of their ‘Connect’
platform. This leverages the Polygon chain (mentioned in the blockchain chapter). Many
digital wallets can be connected from the user end, with Metamask potentially being the
easiest to integrate. This has also been mentioned in the book. The downside of this for
our open platform is that none of these elements are particularly open, or distributed, and
the users of the platform will still need to use an exchange to get the USDC to spend.
This approach makes it easier for the vendors and product providers in the metaverse
applications to accept USDC, but everything else is actually harder.

4.3 Central bank digital currencies

If 2021 was the year of the stablecoin then 2022 is likely to be the year of the central
bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDCs would likely not exist without the 2019 catalyst
of Facebook Libre crypto currency project, which is now cancelled and defunct, pressure
exerted on central banks by the concept of Bitcoin, and the stablecoins which emerged
from the technology.

It now seems plausible that the world is moving toward a plurality of national and
private digital currencies. Figure 4.3 from the Bank for International Settlement, shows the
growing acceptance within central banks. Their 2022 annual economic report dedicates a
42 page chapter to the subject. Hyun Song Shin, head of research at BIS said “Our broad
conclusion is captured in the motto, ‘Anything that crypto can do, CBDCs can do better.“
This text from the thinktank VoxEU highlights the pressure on not to be ‘left behind’:
“Given the rapid pace of innovations in payments technology and the proliferation of virtual

4.3 Central bank digital currencies

72

Figure 4.3: More than half of central banks surveyed by the BIS said they saw issuance of
a CBDC as possible.

currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum, it might not be prudent for central banks to be
passive in their approach to CBDC. If the central bank does not produce any form of
digital currency, there is a risk that it loses monetary control, with greater potential for
severe economic downturns. With this in mind, central banks are moving expeditiously
when they consider the adoption of CBDC.”

CBDCs are wholly digital representations of national currencies, and as such are
centralised database entries, endorsed and potentially issued by national governments.
The USA’s whitepaper shows the approach. Curiously only The Bahamas seem to have a
successful implementation, but it is a rapidly evolving space, and many nations are now
scrambling to catch up.

The following text is taken from the March 2021 Biden government “executive order”

on digital assets, and deﬁnes the current global legislative position well.
“Sec. 4. Policy and Actions Related to United States Central Bank Digital Currencies. (a)
The policy of my Administration on a United States CBDC is as follows:
(i) Sovereign money is at the core of a well-functioning ﬁnancial system, macroeconomic
stabilization policies, and economic growth. My Administration places the highest urgency
on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options
of a United States CBDC. These efforts should include assessments of possible beneﬁts
and risks for consumers, investors, and businesses; ﬁnancial stability and systemic risk;
payment systems; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; ﬁnancial inclusion
and equity; and the actions required to launch a United States CBDC if doing so is deemed
to be in the national interest.
(ii) My Administration sees merit in showcasing United States leadership and participation
in international fora related to CBDCs and in multi-country conversations and pilot
projects involving CBDCs. Any future dollar payment system should be designed in a
way that is consistent with United States priorities (as outlined in section 4(a)(i) of this
order) and democratic values, including privacy protections, and that ensures the global

4.3 Central bank digital currencies

73

ﬁnancial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture
interoperability or transferability, as appropriate.
(iii) A United States CBDC may have the potential to support efﬁcient and low-cost
transactions, particularly for cross-border funds transfers and payments, and to foster
greater access to the ﬁnancial system, with fewer of the risks posed by private sector-
administered digital assets. A United States CBDC that is interoperable with CBDCs issued
by other monetary authorities could facilitate faster and lower-cost cross-border payments
and potentially boost economic growth, support the continued centrality of the United
States within the international ﬁnancial system, and help to protect the unique role that
the dollar plays in global ﬁnance. There are also, however, potential risks and downsides
to consider. We should prioritize timely assessments of potential beneﬁts and risks under
various designs to ensure that the United States remains a leader in the international
ﬁnancial system.”

In traditional nation state currencies the central banks control the amount of currency
in circulation by issuing debt to private banks, which is then loaned out to individuals
[80]. The debt is ‘destroyed’ on the balance sheet to remove currency through the reverse
mechanism. They also facilitate government debt [81], and work (theoretically) outside of
political control to adjust interest rates, in order to manage growth and ﬂows of money.

It is somewhat surprising that Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve has recently
said “Rapid changes are taking place in the global monetary system that may affect the
international role of the dollar. A US central bank digital currency is being examined to
help the US dollar’s international standing.”. This is a rapid evolution of the narrative,
with implications. It seems unlikely that the world would sacriﬁce the traditional banking
system in favour of centrally controlled money, but many things which cannot be done with
traditional nation state money systems are possible with CBDCs, because they remove the
middleman of private banking between the end user and the policy makers.

• Negative interest rates are possible, such that all of the money can lose purchasing
power over time, and at a rate dictated by policy. This “removal of the lower bound”
has been discussed by economists over the last couple of decades as interest rate
mechanisms have waned in efﬁcacy. It is not possible in the current system, and
instead money must be added through quantitative easing, which disproportionately
beneﬁts some though Cantillon effects [82, 83].

• Ubiquitous basic income is possible in that money can be issued directly from
government to all approved citizens, transferring spending power directly from the
government to the people. This also implies efﬁciency savings for social support
mechanisms.

• Asset freezing and conﬁscation are trivial if CBDCs can replace paper cash money
completely, as a bearer asset. Criminals and global ‘bad actors’ could have their as-
sets temporarily or permanently removed, centrally, by suspending the transferability
of the digital tokens.

• Targeted bailouts for vital institutions and industries are possible directly from
central government policy makers. Currently private banks must be incentivised to
make cheap loans available to sectors which require targeted assistance.

• Financial surveillance of every user is possible. In this way a ‘panopticon of money’
can be enacted, and spending rulesets can be applied. For instance, social support
money might only be spendable on food, and child support only on goods and
services to support childcare. This is a very dystopian set of ideas. Eswar Prasad

4.3 Central bank digital currencies

74

says “In authoritarian societies, central bank money in digital form could become
an additional instrument of government control over citizens rather than just a
convenient, safe, and stable medium of exchange.” [84]

• It’s a virtually cost free medium of exchange, since there is no physical instrument

which must be shipped, guarded, counted, assayed, and securely destroyed.

• The counterfeiting risk is signiﬁcantly reduced because of secure cryptographic

underpinnings rather than paper or plastic anti counterfeiting technologies.

• Global reach and control is instantly possible for the issuer. This is a big problem
especially for a reserve currency such as the dollar. Two thirds of $100 bills are
thought to reside outside of the USA.

• System level quantitative easing and credit subsidies are made far simpler and less

wasteful when centrally dictated.

• Transfer of liability and risk to the holder globally reduces the management costs for

global deposits of a currency.

• It may be possible to automate the stability of a currency through continuous adjust-

ment of the ‘peg’ through algorithms or AI.

The UK has signalled that it is not interested in developing a CBDC at this time. It is
viewed as a solution in search of a problem, with the Lords economic affairs committee
saying:“The introduction of a UK CBDC would have far-reaching consequences for
households, businesses, and the monetary system for decades to come and may pose
signiﬁcant risks depending on how it is designed. These risks include state surveillance of
people’s spending choices, ﬁnancial instability as people convert bank deposits to CBDC
during periods of economic stress, an increase in central bank power without sufﬁcient
scrutiny, and the creation of a centralised point of failure that would be a target for hostile
nation state or criminal actors.”

Meanwhile in Europe, ECB President Christine Legarde said: “On your question
concerning CBDC, you know my views on CBDC and you know that I have pushed
that project. Fabio Panetta is working hard on that together with members in the entire
Eurosystem with the high-level taskforce that is working really hard on moving forward.
But in a way, I am really pleased that attention is now focussed on the role that cryptos can
play and the role that Central Bank Digital Currency can have when they are implemented.
We have a schedule, as you know. The Governing Council decided back in October ’21
to launch a two-year investigation phase, and it is at the end of that investigation phase
that the decision will deﬁnitely be made to launch the CBDCs and to make it a reality. We
can’t go wrong with that project. I am conﬁdent that we will move ahead, but that’s going
to be a decision of the Governing Council. I think it’s an imperative to respond to what
the Europeans expect, and I think we have to be a little bit ahead of the curve if we can
on that front. If we can accelerate the work, I hope we can accelerate the work. I will
certainly support that and I was delighted to see that in the United States there was an
executive order by President Biden to actually expect similar effort and focus and progress
on CBDC, cryptos. I think that it will take all the goodwill of those who want to support
sovereignty, who want to make sure that monetary policy can be transmitted properly using
our currency, will endeavour.”

In the USA this text from Congressman Tom Emmer shows how complex and interest-
ing this debate is becoming.“Today, I introduced a bill prohibiting the Fed from issuing
a central bank digital currency directly to individuals. Here’s why it matters: As other
countries, like China, develop CBDCs that fundamentally omit the beneﬁts and protections

4.4 Bitcoin as a money

75

of cash, it is more important than ever to ensure the United States’ digital currency policy
protects ﬁnancial privacy, maintains the dollar’s dominance, and cultivates innovation.
CBDCs that fail to adhere to these three basic principles could enable an entity like
the Federal Reserve to mobilize itself into a retail bank, collect personally identiﬁable
information on users, and track their transactions indeﬁnitely.
Not only does this CBDC model raise “single point of failure” issues, leaving Americans’
ﬁnancial information vulnerable to attack, but it could be used as a surveillance tool that
Americans should never be forced to tolerate from their own government.
Requiring users to open an account at the Fed to access a United States CBDC would put
the Fed on an insidious path akin to China’s digital authoritarianism.
Any CBDC implemented by the Fed must be open, permissionless, and private. This means
that any digital dollar must be accessible to all, transact on a blockchain that is transparent
to all, and maintain the privacy elements of cash.
In order to maintain the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency in a digital age, it
is important that the United States lead with a posture that prioritizes innovation and does
not aim to compete with the private sector.
Simply put, we must prioritize blockchain technology with American characteristics, rather
than mimic China’s digital authoritarianism out of fear.”

Most analysts now seem to think that there is little appetite to replace all of a given
currency with a CBDC. Most signiﬁcantly such products would need the support of retail
banks, and it is not in their interest to service such a product. Their business model relies on
using retail deposits for providing loans, and it is these deposits, not cash itself that would
be the most addressable market for a CDBC. Banks don’t want people to self custody
money. In addition it exposes the whole banking system to a higher risk of bank runs. Such
a self custody, interest bearing, central government backed asset would have signiﬁcantly
less counterparty risk than even bank deposits, and at times of high systemic stress it seems
likely that money would ﬂow to where it’s thought safest, exposing the retail banks to runs.
All of the proposed solutions to these problems such as caps and negative interest penalties
seem poorly thought through.

It is far more likely that a blend of stablecoins, private bank issued digital currency
(with a yield incentive) and perhaps some limited CBDC, alongside the new contender
Bitcoin, will present a new landscape of user choice. Different models of trust, insurance,
yields, acceptability, and potentially privacy, will emerge.

Clearly a global, stable, wholly digital bearer asset in a native currency would be the
ideal integration for money in a metaverse application, but it is likely that a transition to
such a technology would be complex and painful. It is certainly not ready for consideration
now.

4.4 Bitcoin as a money

Nwosu, cofounder of Coinﬂoor exchange in the UK, and cofounder of the aforementioned
Fedimint and says that a digital money needs the following four characteristics:

• that it be technically mature.
• it should have strong community support and network effect. We have seen that this

is more simply a feature of money itself.

• that there should be regulatory clarity around the asset, a feature which even Bitcoin

currently struggles with.

4.4 Bitcoin as a money

76

• it should demonstrate a core use case of ‘store of value’ which sounds simple enough,

but again is contestable because of the volatility of Bitcoin.

4.4.1 Spending it

Since this book seeks to examine transfer of value within a purely digital environment it is
necessary to ask the question of whether Bitcoin is money. This short ‘story’, purportedly
written by Nakamoto, is a fabulous look at the money values of the technology, irrespective
if it’s provenance. In it is the following text: “Here, for once, was this idea that you could
generate your own form of money. That’s the primary and sole reason, is because it was
related to this thing called money. It wasn’t about the proﬁciency of the code or the novelty,
it was because it had to do with money. It centered around money. That is something
people cared about. After all, plenty of projects on Sourceforge at the time were just as
well coded, well maintained, if not better, by teams, and even if someone else had created
the blockchain before me, had it been used for something else beyond currency, it probably
would not have had much of an outcome.

Again, irrespective of the author here, this point seems to ring true. The memetic power
of Bitcoin is in it’s proximity to ‘money’, and the potential of the separation of money
from the state.

It is beyond argument that the Bitcoin network is a rugged message passing protocol
which achieves a high degree of consensus about the entries on it’s distributed database.
Ascribing monetary value to those database entries is a social consensus problem, and
this itself is a contested topic. The most useful ‘hot take’ here is that Bitcoin behaves most
like a ‘property’, while it’s network behaves far more like a monetary network which is
created and supported by the value of the Bitcoin tokens.

Jack Mallers, of Strike presentation to the IMF identiﬁed the following challenges

which he claims are solved by the bitcoin monetary network.

• Speed
• Limited transparency and dependability
• High cost
• Lack of interoperability
• Limited Coverage
• Limited accessibility

He further identiﬁes the attributes of the ideal global money.

• Uncensorable
• Unfreezable
• Permissionless
• Borderless
• Liquid
• Digital

Mallers has recently announced USA focused partnerships which leverage his Strike
product to enable spending Bitcoin, through Lightning, as Dollars in much of the point
of sale infrastructure in the USA. This is a huge advance as it immediately enables the
vendors both online and at physical locations to either save 3% costs for card processors,
or else pass this on as a discount. Crucially for ‘Bitcoin as a money’ it also allows the
vendors to receive the payment as Bitcoin, not Dollars. A possible further and highly
signiﬁcant feature is that it might now be possible to divest of Bitcoin in the USA, buying
goods, without a capital gains tax implication. Mallers claims to have legislative backing

4.4 Bitcoin as a money

77

for this product, but the devil will likely be in the detail. The likely mechanism for this
product is that the EPOS partner sends a Lighting request to Strike, which liquidates some
of their Bitcoin holding to a dollar denominated stablecoin, but in a tax free jurisdiction
such as El Salvador. This stablecoin will then be sent to the EPOS handing partner such
as NCR. Stablecoin to Dollar transactions in the USA are much murkier and likely don’t
cost anything for these companies. This agent will then authorise the Dollar denominated
sale to the American digital till. Crucially nobody has a US capital gains tax exposure in
this chain, and all of the settlements were near free, and instantaneous, with ‘cash ﬁnality’
for everyone except the EPOS company. They are likely actually exposed to a small risk
here because uptake will be very low level. The novelty opportunity will likely cover any
potential exposure to stablecoin collapse. This is a radical upgrade on the normal ﬂow of
divesting Bitcoin for American users.

Using this open product to spend Bitcoin as Bitcoin to vendors might be available
through Shopify globally. Again, it’s too new to be sure. Promisingly a Deloitte study has
found that 93% of businesses accepting Bitcoin have seen revenue and brand perception
improve, and 75% of USA sales execs plan to accept digital assets at some point in the
next 2 years. This ambition in the US markets is likely to beneﬁt from the proposed $200
tax exempt law for purchasing goods and services with Bitcoin.

Of these recent developments in Lightning Lyn Alden says: Some people naturally
dismiss [strike] because they don’t want to spend their BTC; they want to save it. However,
the more places that accepted BTC at point of sale (on-chain or Lightning or otherwise),
the more permissionless the whole network is. This is because, if all you can do with
BTC is convert it back into ﬁat on a major exchange, then it’s easy to isolate it, effectively
blacklist addresses, etc. But if you can directly spend it on goods and services across
companies and jurisdictions, it’s harder to isolate. There are now plenty of vendors that
make this easy for merchants to implement, and the merchant can still receive dollars
if they want (rather than BTC), or can decide their % split. Since it’s an open network,
anyone can build on it, globally. And then when you add ﬁat-to-BTC-to-ﬁat payments over
Lightning, it gets even more interesting because it doesn’t necessarily need to be a taxable
event. Lightning wallets with a BTC balance and a USD/stablecoin balance. Lower fees
than Visa and others.

4.4.1.1 Bitcoin based FIAT

More interestingly for metaverse applications Mallers has opened this section of the
company to interact with the public Lightning network, allowing people with a self hosted
wallet or node to pay directly for goods across America, settling immediately in Dollars,
using their Bitcoin, at zero cost. This opens the possibility to buy from US based
(Dollar denominated) metaverse stores, using the capabilities of the stack assembled
at the end of the book. The implications globally are unclear at this time.

Stablesats is another approach which uses exclusively lightning bitcoin but makes the
value stable against the US dollar using an algorithm. This is a very interesting option and
will be explored in detail at some point.

4.4.2 Saving with it

The Bitcoin community believes that Bitcoin is the ultimate money, a ‘store of value’,
chance to separate money from state, increase equality of opportunity and ubiquity of
access, while others view it as ‘rat poison’, or a fraudulent Ponzi scheme [85]. A notable

4.4 Bitcoin as a money

78

Figure 4.4: Potential market exposure to Bitcoin as a money

exclusion from the negative rhetoric is Fidelity, the global investment manager, who have
always been positive and have recently said: “Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary
good, and one of the primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in
an increasingly digital world.”

The following paraphrases Eric Yakes, author of ‘The 7th Property’. Again, this is an
Austrian economics perspective, and like much economic theory the underlying premise is
contested[86]: “Paper became money because it was superior to gold in terms of divisibil-
ity and portability BUT it lacked scarcity. People reasoned that we could beneﬁt from the
greater divisibility/portability of paper money as long as it was redeemable in a form of
money that was scarce. This is when money needed to be “backed” by something.
Since we changed money to paper money that wasn’t scarce, it needed to be backed by
something that was. Since the repeal of the gold standard, politicians have retarded the
meaning of the word because our money is no longer backed by something scarce.
So, what is bitcoin backed by? Nothing.
Sound money, like gold, isn’t “backed”. Only money that lacks inherent monetary proper-
ties must be backed by another money that maintains those properties. The idea that our
base layer money needs to be backed by something is thinking from the era of paper money.
Bitcoin does not require backing, it has inherent monetary properties superior to any other
form of money that has ever existed.”

The 2022 ARK Big Ideas report again provides some useful market insight. They posit
that demand for the money features of Bitcoin could drive the price of the capped supply
tokens to around 1M pounds per Bitcoin as in Figure 4.4. Take this with the usual pinch
of salt, as Ark have been performing notably badly lately with their predictions. Perhaps
more than any of these takes, it is worth considering the current public perception of the
technology as a money and store of value. This twitter thread from professional sportsman
Saquon Barkley, to his half million followers on the platform, captures the mood. He is
one of a handful of athletes now being paid directly in Bitcoin.

“I want my career earnings to last generations. The average NFL career is 3 years and

4.4 Bitcoin as a money

79

inﬂation is real. Saving and preserving money over time is hard, no matter who you are. In
today’s world: How do we save? This is why I believe in bitcoin. Almost all professional
athletes make the majority of their career earnings in their 20s. With a lack of education,
inaccessible tools, and inﬂation, a sad yet common reality is many enter bankruptcy later
on. We can do better. We need to improve ﬁnancial literacy. Bitcoin is a proven, safe,
global, and open system that allows anyone to save money. It is the most accessible asset
we’ve ever seen.”

This ubiquity of access is what probably most distinguishes Bitcoin. Previously it could
be argued that only the most wealthy could access the ‘means’ to store their labour without
loss of value over time (through inﬂation). To be clear, inﬂation is an important part of
the money system, somewhat within the control of the central banks, and approximate
to taxation. It applies equally to all holders of the money supply. Asserting that money
should be replaced by a ‘hard asset’ such as Bitcoin, in the place of the more controllable
utility of money, is likely both a fantasy, and wrong minded. This conﬂation of money
and property is a confusion caused by Bitcoin’s proximity to money, and it’s ‘money like’
network, and is extremely commonplace.

These narrative takes are all rooted in the popular idea that Bitcoin is a ‘hedge against
inﬂation’; an increasingly fragile take, as the price plummets with global markets. The
Bitcoin community seems somewhat confused about the nature of money, which is pre-
dictable because we can see in these sections that money is pretty confusing. Money
is the ﬂuid thin ‘working’ layer on top of historical human production, which provides
transaction convenience, and tools for credit. Value is effectively swapped in and out of
this layer through the actions of central banks, controlling inﬂation into acceptable margins.
Simplistically this is done through manipulation of interest rates (the easiness of credit),
quantitative easing (buying of assets) and quantitative tightening (selling of assets). It is
primarily not a long term store of value, as Austrian economists perhaps believe it should
be. This function is left to assets.

Fundamentally, Bitcoin isn’t money (in the traditional sense) because it’s not an IOU,
which money certainly is. It’s a bearer instrument, novel asset class, with money like
properties, as identiﬁed above. As said again and again it functions most like a ‘property’
which can be invested in by anyone, with all the attendant risks of that property class to
the holder. Lyn Alden says it sits somewhere between a saving tool, and an investment,
acting as “programmable commodity money”.

Andrew M. Bailey says “in an ideal world where governments honour the rights of
citizens, they don’t spy, they don’t prohibit transactions, they manage a sound money
supply, and they make sound decisions, the value of bitcoin is very low; we’re just not in
an ideal world”

Another potentially important differentiating affordance is censorship resistance. There’s
really nothing else like it for that one feature. With that said Bitcoin is only a viable ‘money
like thing’ when viewed in the layers described in this book, and elsewhere[87]. The base
chain layer is an apex secure store of value. Whatever layer 2 ultimately emerges is the
transactional layer which could replace day to day cash money, while the hypothetical layer
3 might be useful for complex ﬁnancial mechanisms and contracts operating automatically,
and also provides the opportunity for using the security model of the chain to support other
digital assets, including government currencies through stablecoins. All these things have
a natural home in borderless social spaces.

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

Special thanks to economist Tim Millar for help with this section.

4.5.1 Risks to Bitcoin the money

4.5.1.1 Geopolitics

It can be seen that following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, that sanctions of various
kinds were applied to the Russian economy. One of these was the previously dicussed Swift
international settlement network. Another whole catagory was the removal of support
by private businesses domiciled outside of Russia and Ukraine, and pertinent here is that
VISA, Mastercard, Paypal, and Western Union all removed support for their product rails.
This means that while some cards and services still work, and will likely work again
through Chinese proxies in the coming months, considerable disruption will be felt by
Russian companies and individuals. This is not to say that this disruption is necessarily
wrong, but it is clear now that all of these global ﬁnancial transfer products and services
are contingent on political factors. The same might be true of CBDC products if they gain
traction globally. There is certainly no reason why all money within a physically delineated
border could not be blocked or cancelled. This is not as true for Bitcoin at this time.

However, with enough political will it is technically plausible to incentivise miners
with additional payments to exclude transactions from geolocated wallets. This would be
mitigated by Tor, and in a global anonymous network it is very likely that a miner could be
found at a higher price for inclusion in the next block.

We have already seen much negative political positioning related to the energy concerns
in an earlier chapter. There are similar noises coming from policy makers with regard
to the money utility of the technology. The United Nations have made the following
recommendations: “Developing countries may have less room to manoeuvre, yet the
regulation of cryptocurrencies is possible. The following policies, among others, have the
potential to curb the further spread of the risks of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins:
• Ensuring comprehensive ﬁnancial regulation, through the following actions:

– Require the mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets
and make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, for example by charging
entry fees for crypto-exchanges and digital wallets and/or imposing ﬁnancial
transaction taxes on cryptocurrency trading;

– Ban regulated ﬁnancial institutions from holding stablecoins and cryptocurren-

cies or offering related products to clients;

– Regulate decentralized ﬁnance (such ﬁnance may, in fact, not be fully decen-
tralized, given its central management and ownership, which form an entry
point for regulation);

• Restricting or prohibiting the advertisement of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets
in public spaces and on social media. This new type of virtual, and often disguised,
advertisement requires policymakers to expand the scope of regulation beyond
traditional media. This is an urgent need in terms of consumer protection in countries
with low levels of ﬁnancial literacy, as even limited exposure to cryptocurrencies
may lead to signiﬁcant losses;

• Creating a public payment system to serve as a public good, such as a central bank
digital currency. In the light of the regulatory and technological complexity of central
bank digital currencies and the urgent need to provide safe, reliable and affordable

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

81

Figure 4.5: Nassim Taleb’s Turkey Problem

payment systems, authorities could also examine other possibilities, including fast
retail payment systems.

This is tough talk. We have seen that the IMF is willing to make their loans contingent
on such regulation. This global response to the technology is a signiﬁcant headwind, but
like the internet itself, it’s very hard to actually stop these products being used.

4.5.1.2 Liquidity Lottery

Because holders of BTC are disincentived to sell the asset (assuming future gains) it is
likely vulnerable to something Kao called the ‘liquidity lottery’. This is a supply/demand
mismatch which he thinks could spell the end of the asset class in time.

4.5.1.3 Manipulation of price or the network

Bitcoin is still young and illiquid enough to be highly manipulable. Imagine for instance if
a major organisation or nation state wished to accumulate a signiﬁcant amount of the asset,
but would prefer a lower price.

There is an unknown level of exposure to risk from centralised mining. If a few of the
major mining pools were simultaneously inﬁltrated by a nation state actor then it might
be possible to engineer a ‘deep re-org’ of a large transaction. This would be dealt with
quickly and almost certainly be a transient attack, but the damage to the narrative might
be substantial. A similar vulnerability exists in the centralisation at the level of internet
service providers [58]. This or some other ﬂaw might lead to a selling cascade. Nobody
knows just how vulnerable to selling cascades Bitcoin might be against a really serious
challenge by an empowered actor, but it’s already high volatility is suggestive of risk.

4.5.1.4 Rehypothecation

It’s vulnerable to rehypothecation (paper bitcoin managed by centralised entities running a
fractional reserve). It seems that Figure 4.5 by Nassim Taleb is a cautionary tale [88].

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

82

Figure 4.6: Cycle theory revisited blog post [Image used with permission]

4.5.1.5 Scale

Scalability is always going to be a problem for Bitcoin, for all the reasons discussed in
the blockchain chapter. There is no “ready to go” solution (except perhaps federations)
that could onboard the whole world at this time because of the limited number of available
UTXOs.

Finally, a lack of fungibility, and privacy by default in Bitcoin, trends towards blacklists

and over time this could seriously compromise the use of the asset.

4.5.1.6 Centralisation of the money over time

In a medium term future it’s possible to imagine a smart enough autonomous AI or
ML actor managing to accrue Bitcoin through fast and smart ‘decisions’. This could
unreasonably centralise the asset, and it would be impossible to claw this situation back.
These constructs would last for the lifetime of the chain unless constrained by timelock
multisigs for instance.

4.5.2 Bitcoin externalities

This section is the risks that Bitcoin poses to external money systems, but it’s worth
pointing out that a risk to wider society is clearly also a risk to Bitcoin itself.

4.5.2.1 Inherent volatility

One of the better public analysts of the asset, sees the price eventually ﬂuctuating some-
where between $700k and $300k. Figure 4.6. This is not how a money is supposed to
work.

Neither though is it the endless “number go up” that speculators have been promised.
The aims of the project have a cognitive dissonance right at the core. The volatility trends
toward:

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

83

Figure 4.7: Bitcoin distribution is skewed to s few early holders, but it likely is fair. [Image
used with permission]

4.5.2.2 Unfair distribution

By design the distribution of Bitcoin is likely ‘fair‘, in that everyone has been able to
access and secure the asset long term without prejudice. Figure 4.7 from Twitter user
@Geertjancap shows the distribution in 2021. Whether this is judged to be fair if the asset
jumps to 10 times it’s current value, minting a new class of hyper rich holders, is another
matter. This pressure to emulate the early winners leads to:

4.5.2.3 Endless HODL

It’s possible that there’s a problem with people not wanting to sell the asset, because they
are predisposed to a particular fervour promoted within the community. This can be seen
in the glassnode data, where the black line in Figure 4.8 shows that the asset held for more
than a year (illiquid) has increased over the years. There’s real recalcitrance about using
the asset as a money, which leads to:

4.5.2.4 Reduction of funding source / liquidity in legacy ﬁnance

In the current ﬁnancial system remuneration for labour performed in the workforce is
loaned into the money system, where it’s put to work providing liquidity for creation of
more opportunity. This system actually works pretty well. The more of this deferred
labour that’s taken out of the legacy system, the less work can be done with what remains.
This isn’t to say that Bitcoin will cause a liquidity crisis, but there is possibly a cost if the
current trend continues. This isn’t as bad as:

4.5.2.5 Bitcoin collapse system shock

In the event of an existential collapse of the Bitcoin network the erasure of so much capital
would certainly have a contagion effect on the whole global ﬁnancial system. It’s hard to
imagine what such an event could be, this being the nature of “black swans”. One cited
example is the unravelling of cryptography by quantum computing. Some conspiracy
theorists in the past have even speculated that Bitcoin is itself a canary in the coal mine,

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

84

Figure 4.8: Supply of bitcoin that hasn’t moved for over 1 year

engineered by the NSA to warn about emergent quantum computing somewhere in the
world. It’s all pretty silly because without cryptography Bitcoin would be the least of
humanities problems. The risk of ‘something’ does exist though. The same anti-fragile
feature can’t be said about the technologies around Bitcoin, which gives us:

4.5.2.6 Stablecoin collapse system shock

This is much more likely. Stablecoins are under regulated, centralised, under collateralised,
ponzo like structures, which could quite clearly fall apart at any point. The contagion
effects of this are unclear as they’re not yet too signiﬁcant. They’re a risk nontheless, and
may be an indicator of:

4.5.2.7 Tech for techs sake yielding unexpected outcomes

The whole question of what Bitcoin addresses, whether it’s been properly thought about,
what the end goals are, and what the risks are is signiﬁcant. It’s a computer science and
engineering solutions gone completely wild. It’s clearly got beneﬁts and there’s clearly
human appetite for this technology, but it’s probably running ahead of the knowledge base
around it. This is most exempliﬁed in:

4.5.2.8 No agreed measurable end goal

Bitcoin is a game theoretic juggernaut, where success of the network breeds more success
for the network. The was obviously a great design choice for the computer scientists
trying to solve the problem of a secure, and scalable, electronic cash, which couldn’t be
conﬁscated. Ironically for a global consensus mechanism it seems that nobody wants to
discuss what constitutes a successful end point to this, and especially not what ‘successful’
endpoints for the game theory which have calamitous negative repercussions for wider
society look like. This might have implications for:

4.5.2.9 National security / actual warfare

There’s some national security implications for Bitcoin which are discussed both in the
fringes and the sector media. Essentially, the industrial mining complexes which are more
commonplace now, are easily identiﬁable targets, and provide nations with both some

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

85

leverage over the global network, and a considerable source of income. The IMF correctly
identiﬁes these facilities as a way for nation states to monetise their energy reserves without
the need for foreign markets, opening the door to sanction avoidance. In the case of smaller
and developing nation states who are perhaps subject to ﬁnancial penalties on the global
stage for whatever reason, these facilities start to look like legitimate targets for cyber and
conventional warfare. This ‘weaponisation’ of a neutral technology is already manifest in:

4.5.2.10 Bitcoin as a culture war foil

Bitcoin’s online community skews very hard toward right wing libertarianism. This isn’t
to say there are no other voices, but they are certainly outnumbered. This imbalance is
almost certainly a product of the ESG concerns around the technology. There has been
a notable increase in diversity of thought since the evolution of the energy narrative, but
it persists. This leads to a paucity of voices in policy making circles, and in the USA
a strong delineation between policy makers along party lines. This kind of thing tends
to be self reinforcing, and it seems very possible that the global liberal left will swing
mainly against the technology, while the neoliberal right will be attracted more to it. As
tensions increase so it seems does the online rhetoric. Even scientists now seem to agree
that Bitcoin investors are calculating psychopaths [89]. This leads to:

4.5.2.11 Self reinforcing monocultures

There are some powerful ‘pockets’ of fringe thinking within the vocal, online, Bitcoin
communities. The most palatable of these are ﬁgures like Michael Saylor, Elon Musk and
Jack Dorsey, but there’s whole subcultural intersections around antivax, anti-woke, anti
cancel culture, and fad diets. It might seem that this isn’t terribly important, but Bitcoin
viewed though the lens of these of these communities looks pretty strange to the newcomer.
The early adopters are just using their wealth to leave the battleﬁeld behind using:

4.5.2.12 Jurisdictional / legislative arbitrage

The reach of Bitcoin and it’s ability to undercut the global money systems, delivering
savings for those with a ﬁrst mover advantage, and the current paucity of agreed legislation
has set up an interesting and rare condition. Bitcoin encourages something called juris-
dictional arbitrage; the race to take advantage of the variance in national approaches to
the asset class. This section could perhaps be explored as a list of opportunities, but from
the viewpoint of our SME business use case it’s far more likely that these destabilising
‘features’ are risks:

• Difference in ‘crypto’ proﬁt models. Countries and jurisdictions can apply differ-
ent charges for use of trading platforms and capital gains tax enjoys huge variance.
Some countries are now competing to offer zero tax as a way to attract valuable tech
mind share.

• Income tax is harder to monitor in a truly international context. This is variously
pitched around the world. It’s hard to monitor this stuff and tax at source like with
company employees wages, because it’s basically designed to be hard to monitor.
This results in:

• Passport perks. Countries are already selling residence and company rights against
Bitcoin marketing. There’s a lot of new ways to buy passports and citizenship based
on ‘inclusion’ in this community now. It’s a terrible look. The early adopters can
live international jetsetter lifestyles and ca beneﬁt from:

• Business subsidies such as those appearing in Switzerland, Hondoras, El Salvador,

4.5 Risks (money, not technical)

86

Africa etc. This means a new divide is emerging since some countries are in instead
applying:

• KYC/AML rules which make onboarding into this technology harder. Currently
there’s a trend toward globally capturing information about people buying these
assets, but it’s effectively tech warfare now with engineers, rapidly producing tools
to circumvent slow and varied legislation. The best example of this remains El
Salvador, where Bitcoin is legal tender, and has perhaps kickstarted:

• Bond issuances. El Salvador are having a faltering start to their promised bond

issuance. It might be that all of this is a harbinger of the rise of:

• The Network State is a proposal by Srinivasan [90]. His is a transhumanist thesis
which he describes: “The fundamental concept behind the network state is to
assemble a digital community and organize it to crowdfund physical territory. But
that territory is not in one place — it’s spread around the world, fully decentralized,
hooked together by the internet for a common cause, much like Google’s ofﬁces
or Bitcoin’s miners. And because every citizen has opted in, it’s a model for
100% democracy rather than the minimum threshold of consent modeled by 51%
democracies.”

4.5.2.13 Hyperbitcoinization

All of the above starts to look like convergence on something the crypto community
regularly describes to itself within it’s internal media. Hyperbitcoinization is a term coined
in 2014 by Daniel Krawisz [91]. It is the hypothetical rise of Bitcoin to become the global
reserve currency, and the demonetisation of all other store of value assets. This seems
unlikely but is hinted at in a game theoretic analysis of both Bitcoin and current macro
economics. Again, Bitcoin is a likely very poor replacement for money. The ability to
monetise assets through banks, backed by law and contracts (the debt based system), is
a highly reﬁned human concept, while Bitcoin is a fusion of Austrian economics, and a
computer science project. The hyperbitcoinization idea ﬁnds it’s ultimate expression in
Svalholm’s “Everything Divided by 21 Million”, a hypothetical re-accounting of all human
production into the Bitcoin ledger [92].

Nobody is sure what a regular deﬂationary cycle might do to global supply chains.
Malherbe et al. point out the inherent unsuitability of a deﬂationary asset such as Bitcoin
as the global reserve currency [93] and feel that perhaps other cryptocurrencies might
be more suitable for adoption by governments. Interestingly this is the only paper to
reference ‘Duality’ (the only thing purportedly written by Satoshi Nakamoto after they left
the project).

Writer and activist Cory Doctorow is not a fan of Bitcoin. He provides an excellent
summary of what he sees as the basic societal mistake of the libertarian ideals around strong
property rights and hard money. In a hyperbitcoinised world where debt law would be
enforced by distributed code, it might be far harder to prevent the “fall of Rome” scenario
he describes.

Fulgur Ventures (a venture capital ﬁrm) provide a blog post series about the route this
might take. It’s important to note that Budish suggested that the usefulness of Bitcoin (and
blockchain) cannot exceed the cost to attack it. The is highly suggestive that hyperbitcoini-
sation is impossible [94]. It’s beyond the scope of this book to look at the implications of
all this.

4.6 Does DeFi matter to SMEs

4.6 Does DeFi matter to SMEs

DeFi is decentralised ﬁnance, and might only exist because of partial regulatory capture of
Bitcoin. If peer-to-peer Bitcoin secured yield and loans etc were allowed then it seems
unlikely that the less secure and more convoluted DeFi products would have found a
footing. DeFi has been commonplace over the last couple years, growing from essentially
zero to $100B over the last two or three. It enables trading of value, loans, and interest
(yield) without onerous KYC. If Bitcoin’s ethos is to develop at a slow and well checked
rate, and Ethereum’s ethos is to move fast and break things, then DeFi could best be
described as throwing mud and hoping some sticks. A counter to this comes from Ross
Stevens, head of NYDig who says “The concept of decentralized ﬁnance is powerful, noble,
and worthy of a lifetime of focused effort.”. This may be true in principle, but certainly
isn’t the case as things stand.

According to a recent JPMorgan industry insider report, around 40% of the locked
value on the Ethereum network is DeFi products. It is characterised by rapid innovation,
huge yields for early adopters, incredibly high risk, and a culture of speculation which
leads to products being discarded and/or forked into something else in the pursuit of returns.
Ethereum also allows miners of the blockchain to cheat the system [95].

Much of the space is now using arcane gamiﬁcation of traditional ﬁnancial tools,
combined with memes, to promote what are essentially pyramid schemes. Scams are very
commonplace. Loss of funds though code errors are perhaps even more prevalent.

The Bank for International Settlements have the stated aim of supporting central banks
monetary and ﬁnancial stability. Their 2021 report on DeFi noted the following key
problems.

• ..a “decentralisation illusion” in DeFi due to the inescapable need for centralised
governance and the tendency of blockchain consensus mechanisms to concentrate
power. DeFi‘s inherent governance structures are the natural entry points for public
policy.

• DeFi’s vulnerabilities are severe because of high leverage, liquidity mismatches,

built-in interconnectedness and the lack of shock-absorbing capacity.

These are two excellent and likely true points. European Parliament Vice President Eva
Kaili made this same point at the World Economic Forum, so clearly regulators are aware of
the lack of meaningful distribution in DeFi. In addition access to DeFi is ‘usually’ through
Web2.0 centralised portals (websites) which are just as vulnerable to legal takedown orders
as any other centralised technology. Given who the major investment players seem to be in
this ‘new’ ﬁnancial landscape it seems very likely that regulatory capture is coming. The
seemingly unironic trend towards CeDeFi (centralised decentralised ﬁnance) illustrates
this; it’s is all likely a fad.

There are more recent DeFi on Bitcoin contenders, but these are vulnerable to the same

attacks and problems in the main.

There is likely no use for this technology for small and medium sized companies on
the international stage. It is far more likely that reputation would be damaged. The ‘best’
of the portfolio of DeFi offerings is perhaps high yield stablecoin accounts, where dollars
equivalent tokens are locked up providing very high return rates of up to 20 percent. It’s
also possible to get loans (by extension business loans) out of such systems at relatively low
risks. The best ‘distributed’ example of this is probably Lend, at HODLHODL, which is a
peer-to-peer loan marketplace. Atomic Finance leverages discrete log contracts amongst

4.6 Does DeFi matter to SMEs

88

other more edge uses of Bitcoin, to provide ﬁnancial services without custody of the
users’ Bitcoin. It is possible to make the argument that between hodlhodl loans, taro asset
issuance, boltz exchange, and lightning escrow that all of the “classes” of DeFi smart
contract can be serviced already by Bitcoin alone.

Many more custodial options exist for loans (CASA, BlockFi, Nexo, Ledn, Abra etc).
These might not really ﬁt the deﬁnition of DeFi at all. Many of these centralised DeFi
companies (CeDeFi) have imploded in the wake of the Terra/Luna collapse since they were
generating yield from one another and ultimately Terra. The maxim seems to be that if
you don’t know how the system is monetised then you are likely the product. DeFi itself
weathered the recent market turmoil comparatively well and it’s possible that as these
products evolve they may be useful to companies who have Bitcoin and stablecoins on
their balance sheet long term. Dan Held maintains an online spreadsheet which compares
these products.

5. Distributed Identity & Trust

For distributed Web3, and by extension metaverse applications to ﬂourish it is necessary to
solve the identiﬁcation problem [96]. Without a solution to this bots, scammers, and AI
actors will reduce usefulness and usability of and already quite arcane user experience.

This chapter is an oddity because most of traditional DID/SSI isn’t really ﬁt for purpose.
Distributed self sovereign identity has a great elevator pitch though. Individuals should
be empowered through technology to manage their own data, without manipulation or
exploitation by centralised corporate behemoths. In practice it’s a staggeringly complex
proposition which increases risk to the individual, decreases convenience, and despite
much work, does not even make much sense in it’s own terms. Webs of trust are viable so
this means Nostr, Marking, or Slashtags which will be discussed, but are early products.
Thanks to Melvin Carvalho for advice with this section.

5.1 Applications of DID/SSI

Some of the likely, and discussed applications for DID/SSI are the more inherently private
and personally valuable sets of data an individual might generate throughout their life.
The theory is that subsets of such data could then be digitally revealed by the individual
when required, and that cryptographic veriﬁcation built into the system would guarantee
the veracity of the data to the receiving party. It is also possible to make use of “zero-
knowledge proof” such that assertions can be made about about the contents of the data
without revealing the data itself. A good example of this an age veriﬁcation challenge,
where a threshold age could be asserted without necessarily revealing the date of birth.
Other keystone uses of the technology are:

• health documents history
• qualiﬁcations and certiﬁcations
• ﬁnancial record and relationships with those of others
• contacts, connections to other people and their appropriate data, including things

like shared and personal calendars

It’s also possible to extend this key management ethos to all login credentials, and all data
currently stored on centralised servers. This is the tension discussed in the chapter about
Web3. Proponents think that using something like a DID/SSI stack to manage encryption,

5.2 Classic DID/SSI

90

Figure 5.1: Part of the DID SSI specs

decryption and access to data within cloud services gives the user the best of all worlds.
They see simply logging in with a cryptographic wallet, and using that same public/private
key pair to manage the data beyond as some kind of panacea. This is very complex stuff
though, and it seems very likely they just haven’t thought this through enough.

5.2 Classic DID/SSI

Distributed identity / self sovereign identity has been extensively researched for decades,
with hundreds of peer reviewed papers, and extensive support from the world wide web
consortium. The academic ﬁeld now seems quite ossiﬁed and has settled on a couple of
hundred ‘schema’ which they feel underpin the next layer of development. It is a complex
ﬁeld, and the language and diagrams are arcane and self referential as seen in Figure 5.1.
. Moreover the minimal implementation of such proposed systems hints at a federated
model of centralised ‘truth’ to enable persistence of identiﬁers over time.
The major failing of the DID/SSI work to date is a lack of meaningful use cases with
incentives for adoption. This is clearly explained by Lockwood [97] who proposes that the
pathway to adoption of ‘classic’ DID/SSI requires an incentive over and above the current
identity management on the web. Being distributed is not enough. Especially in the light
of questionable assurances of this even being true.
Perhaps most concerning is this recent exchange on the mailing lists. Here, two long
standing developers of DID say the following:
“Not a single entity I know that’s doing production deployments has actually vetted did:ion
and found it to be production capable. This goes for every DLT-based DID Method out
there - even the one we’re working on. I am highly sceptical of anyone that says that any

5.3 Newer Technologies

91

DID Method is ready for production usage at present.
Agreed — as one of the proponents of DLTs (in particular permissionless public ones)
none are mature enough yet for production.”. It seems then that we can rule out use of
these technologies?

5.2.0.1 DID principles

The core principles of distributed identity are that there should be persistent identiﬁers,
like real world documents which assert identity, but with extended use cases. These should
be permanent, and resolvable everywhere, forever. Underpinning this is cryptographically
veriﬁable and decentralised data, managed by the user, or their trusted proxy. As primitives
this makes them lifetime digital assets, that are portable, and unconﬁscatable, with no
required reliance on a trusted third party. By this stage in the book you should be familiar
with these concepts, but application of this fundamental mindset to all personal data and
digital interactions is a bigger reach even than money and value.

5.2.0.2 What’s in a DID document?

All classic DID is underpinned by a DID document what bootstrap the services it’s

use of services such as timestamps, cryptographic signatures, proofs, delegations, and
authorisations. They should contain the minimum amount of information to accomplish
the speciﬁc task required of them.

5.3 Newer Technologies

5.3.1 Lightning

It is possible to log into a website using only Lighting, as in Stacker News.

5.3.2 Slashtags

Slashtags is a new distributed identity open method being developed by Bitﬁnex and Tether
under the Synonym suite. It uses Bitcoin keys for authentication, but communicates a
schema through a metadata exchange.

5.3.3 Web5 & Microsoft ION

Promisingly Jack Dorsey’s company TBD is working on a project called “Web5”. Details
are scant but the promise is decentralised and/or self hosted data and identity running on
Bitcoin, without recourse to a new token. “Components include decentralized identiﬁers
(DIDs), decentralized web node (DWNs), self-sovereign identity service (SSIS) and a
self-sovereign identity software development kit (ssi-sdk)”.

Web5 leverages the ION identity stack. All this looks to be exactly what our metaverse
system requires, but the complexity is likely to be quite high as it is to be built on existing
DID/SSI research which is pretty complex and perhaps has problems.

5.3.3.1 ION

While working at Microsoft on ION Daniel Buchner (now working at Square) or Henry
Tsai said the following, which is worth quoting verbatim:

“While ledger-based consensus systems, on the surface, would seem to provide the
same general features as one another, there are a few key differences that make some more

5.3 Newer Technologies

92

suitable for critical applications, like the decentralized identiﬁers of human beings. Some
of these considerations and features are:

• The system must be open and permissionless, not a cabal of authorities who can

exclude and remove participants.

• The system must be well-tested, and proven secure against attack over a long enough

duration to be conﬁdent in.

• The system must produce a singular, independently veriﬁable record that is as
immutable as possible, so that reversing the record the system produces is infeasible.
• The system must be widely deployed, with nodes that span the globe, to ensure the

record is persisted.

• The system must be self-incentivized, so that nodes continue to operate, process, and
secure the record over time. The value from operation must come from the system
directly, because outside incentive reliance is itself a vector for attack.

• The cost to attack the system through any game theoretically available means must
be high enough that it is infeasible to attempt, and even if an ultra-capitalized attacker
did, it would require a weaponized mobilization of force and resources that would
be obvious, with options for mitigation.
The outcome:

• Number 1 eliminates private and permissioned ledgers
• Number 2 eliminates just about all other ledgers and blockchains, simply because

they are inadequately tested

• For the metrics detailed in 3-6, Bitcoin is so far beyond all other options, it isn’t

even close - Bitcoin is the most secure option by an absurdly large margin.”

On the surface then it might seem that the choice is Bitcoin again, and indeed that the
open source Microsoft ION stack is a natural choice, but it’s complex to run, the interactions
with the blockchain have a cost implication which can’t be surmounted without every user
owning some Bitcoin, and as we have seen, there is no formal validation of this system. In
addition (in the current implementation) an identity proof does not need to be published
to be valid, just timestamped. In this way an identity can be stolen and used years later
to claim later chains of proof. It seems that it might be somewhat useful ‘at scale’ and is
worth additional monitoring and investigation, especially given it’s integration into TBD -
Web5.

5.3.4 Nostr

Nostr is “The simplest open protocol that is able to create a censorship-resistant global
"social" network once and for all.” according to it’s github page. More than that it’s a
client side validated proof of who a user is interacting with, hence being in this identity
section. To be clear, it’s not a completely peer to peer system in that it uses relay servers,
but this gives it some of the best characteristics of both paradigms. This has the following
advantages for our metaverse application;

• it’s lightweight, with minimal network overhead and complexity
• it’s real-time using websockets
• anyone can run a relay server, so one can be run in the deployment in the ﬁnal section

of the book.

• Each of the client peers connecting to the metaverse can be a relay and able to pass
messages and proofs to the other clients without the metaverse server seeing the data
or being online

5.4 Federated social media trust

93

• it’s opensource
• there are multiple usable libraries and tools
• it’s under active development with an excellent team. The lead, ‘Fiatjaf’ is one of

the most proliﬁc developers in the lightning space.

• it’s based on the same underlying cryptographic technology we are using elsewhere,

indeed with it’s use of Bitcoin keys the identity system is global

• it provides the identity proof that we need to validate users and objects into a virtual

space

• it enables message passing
• it scales to be a social network as required
• it need not rely on anything outside of a relay hosted on the metaverse server
• it can likely be scaled to provide one to many bulletin board style applications within

the metaverse

• it can easily operate outside of the walled garden of the metaverse, extending the

reach of the messages

Nostr is incredibly promising, and integrating these relays in the metaverse servers and
clients of the proposed technology stack in this book might allow us globally provable
identity, with privacy by design. It can provide message passing. If all entities in the
metaverse scenegraphs are also Nostr key pairs then schema can be applied consistently
with the economic layer using the same key system as Bitcoin. A curated list of projects
and libraries is available on github.

5.3.4.1 Anigma

Anigma is a Nostr based clone of popular messenger client Telegram. This provides a
web2 interface into the metaverse providing:
• simple cryptographic identity assurance
• private peer to peer chat
• group chats and channels
• email to private message relay
• links into media on web2 hosts

The proposed integration of Nostr, LnBit, Vircadia, and Bitcoin is the core value proposition
of this book, with Anigma the ﬁnal component.

5.4 Federated social media trust

Keybase provides a model of importing proofs from various social media sites. This allows
importing of reputation into new ecosystems.

5.5 Micropayment based web

It seems the war against disinformation is now being lost. Much is written in the media
about Deepfake technology creating plausible fake videos, but probably more pernicious
is the use of toolkits to create entire plausible fake news sites using natural language AI
such as GPT3. This makes it cheap to publish potentially market moving news which is
then rehypothecated by online news vendors who are hungry for clicks. As these pipelines
become more mature it will be difﬁcult to keep fake news for ﬁnancial or political gain out
of the system. One interesting way to do this that isn’t webs of trust or true cryptographic
identity is to charge micropayments for “one to many” publication models. This would

5.6 Are DAOs useful for us?

94

Figure 5.2: Comparison of distributed ﬁle stores

imply a tiny instant payment for clicks, especially on social media sites such as twitter.
This kind of model has been discussed but is only possible in the context of systems such
as Lightning where instant micropayment can be realised. It seems possible that this would
price out speculative ‘noise’ spam from the information space. It’s interesting and ironic
that the origin of proof of work was to underpin just such a spam defeating system [13],
and that Nakamoto mentioned this application for Bitcoin back in 2009. There is now
much chatter about the integration of Bitcoin with Twitter in light of Musks buyout of the
social network. .

5.6 Are DAOs useful for us?

A distributed autonomous organisation, or DAO is a governance structure which is built
in distributed code on a blockchain smart contract system. Token holders have voting
rights proportional to their holding. The ﬁrst decentalised autonomous organisation was
simply called “The DAO” and was launched on the Ethereum network in 2016 after raising
around $100M. It quickly succumbed to a hack and the money was drained. This event

5.7 Risks & Challenges?

95

was an important moment in the development of Ethereum and resulted in a code fork
which preserves two separate versions of the network to this day, though one is falling into
obsolescence. Again, this is covered in Shin’s book on the period in extreme detail, but it
seems this stuff is falling into dusty history now, leaving only a somewhat tarnished and
technically shaky legacy [98].
In practice DAOs have very few committed ‘stakeholders’ and the same names seem to
crop up across multiple projects. Some crucial community decisions within large projects
only poll a couple of dozen eligible participants. Its might be that the experiment of
distributed governance is failing at this stage.

Perhaps more interesting is the use of the DAO concept to crowd fund global projects,
currently especially for the acquisition of important art or cultural items. DAOs are also
emerging as a way to fund promising technology projects, though this is reminiscent of the
2017 ICO craze which ended badly and is likely to fall foul of regulations.

Within the NFT and digital art space PleaserDAO has quickly established a strong
following. “PleasrDAO is a collective of DeFi leaders, early NFT collectors and digital
artists who have built a formidable yet benevolent reputation for acquiring culturally
signiﬁcant pieces with a charitable twist.

Opensea wrangle between IPO and governance token.
ConstitutionDAO, Once upon a time in Shaolin etc

5.6.1 Bisq DAO

One of the better designed DAOs is Bisq DAO. It’s slightly different design trys to address
the issue of overly rigid software intersecting with more intangible and ﬂuid human
governance needs. From their website:

“Revenue distribution and decision-making cannot be decentralized with traditional
organization structures—they require legal entities, jurisdictions, bank accounts, and
more—all of which are central points of failure. The Bisq DAO replaces such legacy
infrastructure with cryptographic infrastructure to handle project decision-making and
revenue distribution without such central points of failure.”

5.6.2 Risks

The most interesting thing about DAOs is that they belong more in this money chapter than
they do in blockchain. As we have seen they’re ﬁnding most success as loosely regulated
crowd funding platforms. If a small company did ﬁnd itself wishing to explore this fringe
mechanism for raising capital, then we would certainly recommend keeping a global eye
on evolving regulation and the onward legal exposure of the company.

5.7 Risks & Challenges?

Classic DID/SSI risks fragmentations. In all DID applications, scaling to a world where the
user is managing potentially thousands of these critical cryptographic data ﬁles is daunting.
Abstracting the guts of this away to make the use simple, and only mindful of thet right
level of information, turns out to be huge problem that nobody has solved It’s not clear
that users want this. In the case of web of trust like Slashtags it’s a big piece of work for
the users to rate all of their digital interactions with a trust metric.

6. Digital Objects & NFTs

Nonfungible tokens are a whole ‘class’ of digital token, separate and distinct from every-
thing discussed to this point. They are generally recognised in law as property in their
own right [99, 100]. In the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and project tokens detailed earlier,
and limiting this description to the Ethereum network for now, a project launching an
ERC-20 token commits contract code to the blockchain, and this contract then mediates
the issuance and management of millions or billions of tokens associated with that project,
and it’s use case. ERC-20 is a fungible token issuance. Each of the projects’ tokens is
interchangeable with any other token. They’re all the same from the point of view of the
user.

Rather than the ERC-20 contract type used for fungible token issuance NTFs predomi-
nantly use ERC-721 protocol on Ethereum (just different instructions). It’s the case that
most NFTs in the 2021/2 hype bubble are algorithmically generated sets of themed art
(so called PFP-NFT). Tens of thousands of distinct tokens are ‘minted’, each one being a
complex transaction commitment to the Ethereum blockchain, along with it’s associated
gas fee. These minting events were much hyped social occasions (before the 2022 market
crash), and happened very quickly, with users clamouring to create art with randomly
allocated features from the art schema associated with the project. Lucky winners could
ﬁnd themselves with an NFT art piece with more than an average number of ‘rare’ features.
If the overall mint becomes more popular, then the secondary market for all of those mints
goes up, and because of the liquidity premium they can go up a lot. The perceived rarer
mints go up a lot more. This whole process is very energy intensive on the chain, and
the vast majority of these project simply trend to zero value. In response to this appalling
cost beneﬁt analysis the Ethereum foundation have proposed EIP-2309 to make minting
NFTs more efﬁcient. They say “This standard lets you mint as many as you like in one
transaction!”

The Ethereum foundation give their somewhat constrained view of NFTs on their
website and it’s a useful primer. On that page they detail some of the use cases, as listed
below, with a critique added:

• Digital content; this is the dominant use case right now. Much more on this later.
• Gaming items; again more on this later, it’s an obvious enough use case but complex
politics in the intersection of games and crypto have stalled the adoption curve.

97

• Domain names; this is just starting to reach for applications now, why not a database

with the ISP/host?

• Physical items; seemed like a clear over-reach as transfer of the NFT does not imply

transfer of the object, but this is emerging as the growth use case.

• Investments and collateral; while this was an emergent option in the space, it’s likely
been a bubble, as owners of the tokens cast around for additional liquidity, and loan
businesses chased yield with higher risk. The recent implosion of lenders and funds
in the crypto space was partly a function of supposedly world class risk managers
accepting jpegs as collateral.

Moving away from Ethereum, NFTs can be minted on most of the other level one chains.
Solana is a great newcomer example. Sol is a terrible chain with regards to decentralisation,
but thanks to that it’s far cheaper and faster to mint NFTs on it, and it’s become a troubling
competitor for Eth (Figure 6.1).

Figure 6.1: Solana NFT markets are enjoying growth compared to Opensea on Ethereum,
even in the downturn.

The same might be true for Cardano’s ADA, though ADA is struggling to hold onto it’s
market position despite some technical advances. It’s worth reiterating here that the nature
of these digital tools likely makes for a ‘winner take all’ market dynamic over time. With
fees being central to this generative NFT use case it’s possible to see that highly centralised,
fast, and cheap chains will capture and eventually dominate the space. Remember that
this likely (game theoretic) outcome might as well be a database running without the stark

6.1 NFT key use cases

98

inefﬁciencies of blockchain. The whole NFT space is a gamble on consumer enthusiasm
for spending money continuing to outpace logic.

Astonishingly, according to a JPMorgan insider market report (reported on in a podcast),
only around 2 million people have ever actually interacted with NFTs. One analysis
suggests that a single entity accounts for 3 of the top 4 holders, having made 32,000
ETH from the NFT boom. This suggests heavy market manipulation and is far from the
egalitarian landscape claimed in the hype. Tellingly it’s thought around 10% of the trading
volume on market leading platform ‘Super Rare’ was by the now bankrupt venture capital
ﬁrm ‘Three Arrows’.

With that said NFTs have clearly allowed digital and new media artists to connect with
audiences without gatekeepers. Established mediators and curators of art have been caught
totally wrongfooted, and NFTs seem to give a way for them to be cut out completely. There
are suggestions of applications beyond this initial digital art scope. This is a compounding,
and disrupting paradigm change.

6.1 NFT key use cases

6.1.1 Art

The recent surge of interest in NFT’s during early 2021 has largely been driven by digital
art NFT’s, despite the origins of digital art NFT’s started much earlier in 2014. New
York artist Kevin McCoy’s Quantum is widely recognised as the ﬁrst piece of art created
as an NFT. However it was during early 2021 that art NFT’s started to gain signiﬁcant
attention; by the end of 2021, nearly £31b had been spent on NFT purchases, a considerable
and exponential growth given 2020 sales of ~£71m High proﬁle digital artists such as
Beeple whose recent recording break sale of his NFT “The ﬁrst 5000 days” (Figure 6.2) at
Christies (a long established British auction house, specialising in high proﬁle precious
work of art) for £52.9m helped bring NFT’s into the public spotlight and wider give them
global attention.

Art as NFT’s offer the following advantages:

6.1.1.1 Immutable Nominal Authenticity

Art fraud such as false representation, forgeries, plagiarism have been a reoccurring blight
since art has existed; artists and works of art have been open to abuse by forgers, black
market proﬁteers and even fellow artists laying claim to works of art of others. Unless a
work of art is sold, exhibited or listed, documenting when and who created it, the nominal
authenticity, which Dutton states as the “correct identiﬁcation of the origins, authorship,
or provenance of an object” [101] can be increasingly mutable over a period of time,
dependent on a multitude of factors, including; the artists existing proﬁle, how widely
and where the work of art is exhibited, if the work of art is commissioned by a patron,
if it’s sold, and proﬁle of the buyer/collector. At its most basic level, once a work of art
is ‘minted’ as an NFT (publishing the art work as a unique token on the blockchain) this
functions as an immutable publicly accessible proof of ownership and by extension proof
of creation. The act of minting is not purely limited to digital art; all an artist requires
is a digital representation of any physical art (sculpture, physical painting, installation
etc..) which can be used as a proxy allowing artists to record the date of creation/origin
of a physical piece of art on the blockchain, a buyer purchasing the NFT can be provided
the actual physical artwork as part of the NFT. Nominal authenticity becomes secure and

6.1 NFT key use cases

99

Figure 6.2: Beeple: First 5000 days, taken from the Christies website, assumed fair use.

immutable for the lifetime of the blockchain (by no means assured).

6.1.1.2 Secure Digital Provenance

Provenance (or the chain of custody) is an important aspect in works of art, antiques
and antiquities. Provenance not only helps assign work to an artist but also documents
ownership history. Digital provenance, an inherent feature of NFT’s means provenance
now no longer becomes what has historically sometime been a contentious detective’s
game at the best of times; one that is open to fraud, misinterpretation and entirely reliant
on good record keeping.

Since provenance can contribute to the value of a piece of art (beneﬁting both the
creator and collector) the use of the blockchain as an open, secure ledger is a far more
trustworthy system than traditional methods of artistic provenance that were cobbled
together; often consisting of a mix of physical and digital documents spanning private &
public sale receipts, art/museum gallery exhibitions and private record keeping). Digital
provenance provided when an artist ‘mints’ a piece of art into an NFT allows artists and

6.1 NFT key use cases

100

collectors to record a secure, permanent unalterable history of transactions for a speciﬁc
piece of art, providing future collector complete trust in the origin and custody of a piece
of art.

6.1.1.3 Decentralised automated royalty payments

Traditionally if a piece of art is sold, the ﬁrst sale may (but not always) beneﬁt the artist
ﬁnancially, however secondary and any subsequent sales would only ever ﬁnancially
beneﬁt the buyer/collector; the original artist would rarely beneﬁt. However If a work
of art is minted into an NFT, royalty payments can be predetermined and automated in
perpetuity directly by the use of a ‘smart contract’. Smart contracts are small, automated
scripts/programs that run automatically and independently of a buyer/seller; pre-determined
conditions are set by the buyer; these trigger when certain conditions are met i.e

6.1.1.4 On sale transfer

20% of total sale amount into digital wallet of the creator. 80% of total sale amount into
digital wallet of the seller.

Once the royalty payment rate is set by the artist/creator, future royalties of all sales
can be paid directly to the artist/creator account (via a digital wallet) without the need of a
third party (traditionally a gallery/agent etc..).

Smart contract driven NFT’s means that even if piece of art is resold 5, 10 or even
a 100,000 times moving through 5, 10 or even a 100,000 different collectors; a pre-
determined royalty payment rate set by the creator would still guarantee the artist/creator
is paid directly from each and every future sale.

Historically provenance for works of art may span across generations, for instance
Gabriël Metsu’s oil on canvas painting The Lace Maker’s provenance, ﬁrst recorded in
1722, now spans 300 years of ownership, including from a British Baron in the 19th century
to an American philanthropist in the 20th century.) Metsu died young at the age of 38,
leaving a widow; neither his/her relatives/descendants beneﬁt from his original work, 300
years later this would be near impossible to facilitate with traditional systems, as even legal
contracts are open and prone to the ravages of time.

NFT smart contracts hold an incredibly potential; an artists descendants ﬁnancially
beneﬁting directly from the resale of a piece of work long after the artist/museum’s/gallery
or even state have turned to dust as long as the original creator’s digital wallet is accessible,
the blockhain becomes an everlasting digital patron ensuring

NFT art currently suffers from the same failure of decentralisation already discussed in
the Ethererum technology stack, but this is compounded by the normalisation of intermedi-
ate art brokers continuing to custody the NFTs even after sale. They are usually selling
a pointer to their own servers. The market is nascent and evolving, but it’s currently not
delivering on it’s core promise.

Proof of ownership is intuitively a pretty obvious application for the technology, but
again it’s hard to justify the expense when the beneﬁts are so slim. Bulldogs on the
blockchain is a clear gimmick, and might even incentivise poor behaviours as there are
two products here which are not necessarily aligned. Much has been written over the years
about deeds to property being passed through blockchains, cutting out the middle man, but
in the event that a house deed NFT was hacked and stolen it’s obviously not the case that
the property would then pass to the hacker.

One of the most interesting companies is Yuga Labs, who launched the incredibly
popular Bored Ape Yacht club set of 10,000 algorithmically generated NFTs. These

6.1 NFT key use cases

101

Ethereum based NFTs were based loosely on the ‘Crypto Punks’ model of PFP-NFT
(variously proﬁle picture project, picture for proof, and picture for proﬁle - no deﬁnition
remains uncontested for long). Yuga launched with a better commercialisation model for
the holders, and a strong marketing drive into celebrity circles. They now regularly change
hands for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Even this ‘blue chip’ NFT is not without
serious criticism: “I’d put it at 99.99% the project is in fact a deliberate troll, intentionally
replete with Nazi symbols and esoteric racist dog whistles”

Yuga recently bought the artistic rights to the commercial reuse of similarly popular
(and preceding) Punks set. This is interesting because they have again handed the com-
mercial re-use rights to the owners of the individual NFTs. This raises the same confusing
problem with attaching commercial rights to an easily stolen token as NFTs for real estate
does. This has been demonstrated recently when Seth Green had a Bored Ape stolen after
creating an animated show around it’s IP. Many more contradictions and ambiguities in
NFT licenses are emerging. Galaxy Digital have surveyed the landscape: “Contrary to
the ethos of Web3, NFTs today convey exactly zero ownership rights for the underlying
artwork to their token holders. Instead, the arrangements between NFT issuers and token
holders resemble a distinctly Web2 maze of opaque, misleading, complex, and restrictive
licensing agreements, and popular secondary markets like OpenSea provide no material
disclosures regarding these arrangements to purchasers. Something more is required,
and that ‘something’ is a legal agreement between the owner of the image—known as
the ‘copyright holder’ and the NFT holder specifying what rights the NFT holder has
with respect to the image. To the extent an NFT purchaser has any rights to the image
associated with his or her NFT at all, those rights ﬂow not from his or her ownership of
the token, but from the terms and conditions contained in the license issued by the NFT
Project governing the NFT holder’s purchase and use of the image. Accordingly, for the
vast majority of NFT projects, owning the NFT does not mean you own the corresponding
digital content that is displayed when you sync your wallet to OpenSea. That content,
as it turns out, is owned and retained by the owner of the copyright associated with that
digital content, typically the NFT project. After reviewing the most used license agreements
for NFT projects, it becomes apparent that NFT standards and smart contracts do not
recognize off-chain law.” There may already be a response from the industry to this in the
shape of a16z’s “can’t be evil” license proposal.

Even so, the community around these collections is incredibly strong, mixing develop-
ers, artists, the rich and famous, and the fortunate and early, into a cohesive community
who communicate online. The developer ‘good will’ is enormous, and it seems possible
that this will lead to faster and broader innovation around the collections, and out into
metaverse applications. The brand is strong, and the individual NFT items both beneﬁt
from, and reinforce that brand, while adding personal narratives and human interest.

As a gauge of how frothy this market still is it’s interesting to look at the APE token
which Yuga just launched. They airdropped 10,000 of the tokens free to each of the 10,000
NFT holders. This instantly created a multi-billion dollar market cap, and a top 50 ‘crypto’
out of thin air, based purely on their brand. It’s clear that there is both brand, and a market
here.

A recent report from "Base Layer" tries to capture the community ‘feature’ of big
brand NFTs. “Crypto culture decoded” explains that is is these online communities which
are the attraction not necessarily the art. This is a powerful ‘in group’ argument, though
speculation remains the most likely underpinning.

6.1 NFT key use cases

102

While it is likely that this is currently a speculative bubble, that is waning already

(Figure 6.3), it seems certain that the technology is here to stay in some form.

Figure 6.3: The bubble bursts on Yuga Bored Apes for now.

6.1.2 Computer & Video Games

Computer & Video games are a huge global business, exponential global growth over the
last 30 years has seen this grow to a point where it has eclipsed both the global movie and
North American sports industries combined.

A global industry with revenues over £120b, with ~half the people on the planet playing

some form of games in 2021.

As the games industry has evolved and matured over the last 40 years, secondary
markets have emerged, most notably the ‘second hand’ games resale market. The rise
of ‘retro’ gaming, has demonstrated the second hand market is a lucrative one for private
resellers, an unopened copy of Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo Entertainment System
recently selling for £1.5M to the extent the market has seen speculators looking to cash in
on the huge global interest in retro/second hand games.

Despite publishers and developers increasingly moving to non-physical digital only’

games, the demand for used games remains incredibly high.

6.1 NFT key use cases

103

Whilst some retailers have adapted their business models to include reselling of
retro/second hand games, the vast majority of publisher/developers/retailers aren’t able to
directly beneﬁt from the emerging retro/second hand games market. The potential of video
games as NFT’s presents a huge opportunity for publishers, developers and players alike,
offering the following advantages:

6.1.2.1 Royalty Sales on Pre-owned Games

; A predetermined proportion of any resale of a used game can automated in perpetuity
via smart contracts; once these are set by the publisher, future royalties of all sales can be
paid directly to the publishers/developers wallets (a digital account) without the need of a
third party (traditionally a retail entity). Traditionally only the initial ﬁrst sale of a game
would ﬁnancially beneﬁt the publisher/developer/retailer, secondary and subsequent sales
would only ever ﬁnancially beneﬁt the purchaser, with many developers/publishers arguing
this is hurting the wider industry through the loss of signiﬁcant income generated by the
secondary and subsequent sales, sometimes over the course of decades. However the use
of NFT’s smart contracts means that if a game is sold/resold through 10,000 collectors; a
pre-determined royalty payment rate set by the publisher would still guarantee the publisher
(and or developer/retailer) takes a proportion of any future sales.

6.1.2.2 Monetisation of User Generated Content:

Games as a NFT’s offer ability to monetise UGC: User generated content. Video games
such as Nintendo’s Pokemon Go (166 million players), Bungie’s Destiny 2 (38 million
players) or miHoYo’s Genshin Impact (9 million players ) all have large, established and
signiﬁcant player bases. What is noteworthy, the games are designed to encourage players
may spend hundreds, or in some cases thousands of hours on one game alone; according
to Destinytracker.com, the top players have amassed total play times over 20,000 hours,
close to 1,000 days or ~ 3 years, which is incredible feat given Destiny 2 only launched 5
years ago in 2017.

Destiny/Pokemon Go and Genshin Impact revolve around a central key game mechanic;
players investing signiﬁcant amounts of time collecting in game digital assets; charac-
ters/weapons/items, often classed as ‘rare’ or ‘exotic’ or ‘5 Star’. These collectibles usually
found by a combination of the accrual of in-game time, completing quests, purchasing
additional in-game items/boosters, and luck (‘RNG’). Players are often encouraged to
share their collections of rare characters/weapons/ objects through in-game achievements,
triumphs, scores acting as a mark of distinction/status symbol.

Traditionally there has been nothing that went beyond sharing the digital badge (i.e
triumph/achievement/accomplishment) on a on social media/gamer’s platform proﬁle.
However NFT’s offer the ideal system for developers/publishers and even players to
monetise user generated/customised data (such as a players unique save game data),
simultaneously allowing: a) creation of an additional monetised ecosystem to meet player
demands i.e. some players who are willing to monetise and ‘sell’ their invested time
in a particular product/service to other players with little time but willing to pay other
players for ‘grinding’ (progressing laborious in game tasks) and a more advanced in-game
progression point. The potential to provide publishers/developers with an additional long-
term income stream, providing a better ROI on computer & video game development,
which in many instances can cost hundreds of millions in development costs spanning 5/10
years, is undeniable.

6.1.2.3 Play to earn revenue models

This is morally dicey at this time and early startups like Axie Inﬁnity are in serious trouble.
A (long) video by Dan Olsen highlights the structural problems with both play to earn and
NFTs. On chain analysis suggested that 40% of accounts in 200 current Web3 games are
bots.

6.1.2.4 Monetizing In game collectibles

customisable in game assets (vanity items such as cosmetic character skins/clothing or
collectible items that offer player advantages(new weapons/vehicles/mods etc,..)

Traditional gamers have pushed back on the seemingly useful idea of integrating NTFs
with traditional games. This may be in part because Ethereum mining has kept graphics
card prices high for a decade.
HBAR partnerships
Critique from Marc Petit of Epic and Unreal.
The following text is from Justin Kan, co-founder of twitch: “NFTs are a better
business model for games. Many gamers seem to be raging hard against game studios
selling NFTs. But NFTs are also better for players. Here’s why I think blockchain games
will be the predominant business model in gaming in ten years. NFTs are a better business
model for funding games . Example: recently I invested in a new web3 game SynCityHQ.
They are building a maﬁa metaverse and raised $3M in their initial NFT drop.
NFTs give studios access to a new capital market for raising capital from the crowd.NFTs
can be a better ongoing model for games. Web3 games will open economies, and by
building the games on open and programmable assets (tokens + NFTs) they will create
far more economic value than they could from any one game. Imagine Fortnite, but other
developers can build experiences on top of the V-Bucks and skins. Epic would get a
royalty every time any transaction happens. As big as Fortnite is today, Open Fortnite
could be much bigger, because it will be a true platform. NFTs are better for gamers
Allowing gamers to have ownership of the assets they buy and earn in game allows them
to participate in the potential growth of a game. It lets gamers preserve some economic
value when they switch to playing something new. But what about the criticisms of NFTs?
Here are my thoughts on the common FUDs: "It’s just a money grab on the part of the
studios!"
Game studios already switched over to the model of selling in-game items, cosmetics, etc
to players long ago. But currently the digital stuff players are buying isn’t re-sellable.
NFT ownership is strictly better for players. "The games aren’t real games." This reminds
me of the criticism of free-to-play in 2008, when the games were Maﬁa Wars / FarmVille.
We haven’t had time for great developers to create incredible experiences yet. Everyone
investing in games knows there are great teams building. "Game NFTs aren’t really
decentralized because they rely on models / assets inside centralized game clients." Crypto
is as much a movement as it is a technology. Putting items on a blockchain is what gives
people trust that they have participatory ownership...which make people willing to buy in
to the game. These assets are “backed” by blockchain. The fact that these item collections
are NFTs will make other people willing to build on top of them. "NFTs are bad for the
environment." Solana and L2s solve this. NFT games are better for players and for game
developers. Like the free-to-play revolution changed gaming, so will blockchain. The
games of the future will be fully robust, with open and programmable economies.”

6.2 Broader and metaverse uses

6.2 Broader and metaverse uses

So far according to a16z NFTs break down into:

• Proﬁle pictures: These were discussed at the start of the chapter and have felt
ubiquitous on Twitter over the last couple of years. The major projects will likely
hold value, but the hype cycle will likely lead to all proﬁle NFTs going in and out of
fashion. There’s potentially a fresh wave of this same kind of low key identity hype
possible in the metaverse, and indeed the two plausible both intersect and converge.
• Art and Music: Art has also been discussed above. Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture
capitalist who founded PayPal has invested in expanded NTF use cases. The ﬁrst
is ‘Royal’ which is experimentally selling limited NFT tokens which contractually
entitle the holder to a portion of music artist royalties. Spotify are experimenting
with music NFTs (and of course in the metaverse). This is an early adopter area, and
again likely converges with our planned uses cases.

• Gaming: As discussed there’s pushback from the gaming community, but huge

investment from the likes of Lego, Blizzard, Epic, Ubisoft etc.

• Gig tickets: Not only the straightforward use of transferable tickets for events as
NFTs on a blockchain (which is impossible due to the cost right now) but also
onward monetisation of ticket stubs as memorabilia. The NBA is already looking at
this.
“The team sells the ticket for face value many many years ago, but when that stub is
being sold now for much more many times over, the team gets none of that money,”
York explained. “But with an NFT stub that changes. Let’s say a new rookie enters
the NBA next season and he turns out to be the next LeBron James. That ticket stub
from his ﬁrst game, as an NFT, the team can put a commission on it — 20 percent or
however much, the NBA decides that. In 10 years when it’s worth a lot of money, I
or whoever owns that NFT, can sell it for say $100,000. The NBA can still collect 20
percent of that sale, because it’s all on a smart contract.”
It seems so obvious that this will extend to the virtual events space in the metaverse.
• Utility: These are broadly ‘membership’ style tokens, and this seems like a sensible
ﬁt. Peter Thiel (again) for instance launches a political funding NFT from Blake
Masters to support his senate ambitions. To be clear, Thiel is a fundamentalist
libertarian, and at the very least highly eccentric. This is not necessarily a positive
for the technology.

• Virtual worlds are a huge application for NFTs, and this seems like it would be a
natural ﬁt for out metaverse application. In reality the $2B of sold so far is mostly
‘allocations’ in nascent ecosystems, being sold as highly speculative assets, without
even a metaverse to use. The majority of that amount is the hyped ‘Otherland’ plots
sold under the Bored Apes brand.

• “Full stack” luxury brands. Nic Carter describes a mating of physical and virtual
luxury goods. His is a useful article on the future direction, and he has also provided
a primer on NFTs. There are many such examples already, such as Tiffanys ‘NFTiff’
- cryptopunks collaboration which will automatically generate royalties for Tiffanys
and parent company Louis Vitton in perpetuity. Such products prove provenance,
create new aftermarket opportunities, and unlock metaverse applications.

It is completely reasonable to assert that these use cases could be accomplished without
the use of NFT technology, and is part of the hype bubble.

Twitter user Cantino.Eth offers an exhaustive roundup of what they think future uses
might be. It’s a thread full of industry insider jargon but it’s indicative of a shift in
focus from speculation to ‘building’ as the market conditions change. Some of the more
interesting (less arcane) use cases identiﬁed in the thread are summarised very brieﬂy
below, again with comments as to how this might pertain to our metaverse applications.
• Hobby tokens, demonstrating interest in an activity. This is potentially a metaverse
adaptation of badges on a blazer in the real world, and might serve to drive commu-
nities in a metaverse. The same is true for activism and political alighnment. It’s a
great idea and worth developing.

• Professional Networks and qualiﬁcation badges, like a LinkedIn qualiﬁcation panel,
but in the metaverse. A cisco NFT in the metaverse for a CCNA qualiﬁcation makes
intuitive sense.

• Badges to indicate membership of distributed projects within a metaverse. This

allows users to identify avatars with shared goals in the metaverse.

• Retail incentives, like brand loyalty stamps or rewards for participation in marketing,
or early access programmes. This is a true in a metaverse marketplace as it is in a
real world coffee shop.

• Multiplayer communities with incentives to hit collective milestones. “Collecting as
a team sport”. This again seems like a great and intuitive opportunity, but is perhaps
less suitable for our more business focussed space. User content submission and
automatic monetisation when reused by brands, bonded to an NFT contract.

• Customer Cohort NFTs: early adopters of successful brands would be able to prove
the provenance of their enthusiasm for a new product, and this might unlock brand
loyalty bonuses. It seems this wouldn’t be a transferable NFT, and is more like the
“soulbound” idea advanced by Meta.

• Education and Customer Support, think an NFT of a great score on reddit community
support forums. A trusted community member badge, but visible in the metaverse.
This is somewhat like the web of trust model advanced earlier in the book.

• NFTs as contracts is far more likely in the metaverse than it has proved to be in real
life. This is how ‘digital land’ and objects will be transferred anyway, but with the
addition of contractual conditionals with external inputs more subtle products may
appear.

6.3 Objects in our metaverse

NFTs seem to be judged crucial to metaverse applications. Meta (ex Facebook) are hanging
their monetisation of their whole rebrand on taking a huge cut from NFT content creators
on their platform.

We have a path to assets and NFTs within the layer 3 elements of our choices (RGB),
but they’re not yet ﬁt for purpose. There are compromise options already available, as
below.

6.3.1 Liquid tokens

We have seen that Liquid from Blockstream is a comparatively mature and battle tested
sidechain framework, based upon Bitcoin. It is possible to issue tokens on Liquid, and these
have their own hardware wallet available. This makes the technology a strong contender
for our uses.

6.3 Objects in our metaverse

107

6.3.2 Sovryn and RSK

It’s slightly unclear when RSK will support assets at this level. This needs to be revisited.

6.3.3 Stacks and STX

There’s another possible option is Stacks, without the network effect of Ethereum, but
closer to the other design choices made so far. “Stacks is an open-source network of
decentralized apps and smart contracts built on Bitcoin.”
This novel approach saw the launch of a layer 1 blockchain token called STX, which is
used in a similar way to gas in Ethereum. but claims settlement on the Bitcoin network.
This is achieved through a novel bridging approach which they call Proof of Transfer
(PoX).
Stacks users say this hybrid approach is a pragmatic solution which enables dApps, smart
contracts, DeFi, NFTs etc without compromising security. In practice the speculative
component of the STX tokens which underpin these operations clouds the issue somewhat.
It is a potentially useful middle ground solution with a great deal of developer attention.

6.3.4 Ethereum

While it’s been discounted elsewhere it’s hard to ignore the network effect of Eth NFTs. If
the aspiration is to attract the bulk of the ‘legacy’ creator/consumer markets then it will
be necessary to support integration of Metamask into any FOSS stack. This isn’t a huge
technical challenge, nor is it particularly of interest to our use cases at this stage, but it
remains a possibility. The main problems remain the slow speed and high expense of the
system.

6.3.5 Solana

Solana is both cheap and fast, because it’s very highly centralised. It seems unlikely that
it’s worth this level of compromise.

6.3.6 Satoshi Ordinals

Satoshi ordinals allow tracking of Sats across transactions, enabling NFT like assignment
tracking. This is a hugely exciting development but extremely early.

6.3.7 Peerswap

It may be possible to use “Peerswap” to execute rebalancing and submarine swaps into
and out of Liquid assets on the sidechain in a single tx. This is anunder explored area at
this time.

6.3.8 FROST on Bitcoin

It might be possible to transfer ownership of a UTXO on the Bitcoin base chain using
FROST [102]. In this Schnorr & Taproot based threshold signature system it’s possible to
add and remove signatories and thresholds of signing without touching the UTXO itself.
In principle (though not yet in practice) this might allow transfer of UTXO ownership.

6.3 Objects in our metaverse

108

6.3.9 Spacechains

It feels like spacechains are almost ready, so this is worth keeping an eye on. It’s the
‘cleanest’ way to issue assets using Bitcoin because there’s no additional speculative chain.
As brieﬂy explained in the earlier section Bitcoin is destroyed to create a new chain which
then inherits the security of Bitcoin through onward mining. This new asset or chain is
able to accrue value and trade independently based purely on it’s value to the buyer, not as
a function of a wider speculative bubble attached to a token with multiple use cases.

7. Metaverses

7.1 Toward an open metaverse

For years various companies have attempted to build closed ecosystems which look now
like attempts at digital society, but are more like isolated metaverse systems, or more
usefully isolated digital ecosystems. This is still happening. There’s every chance that
when Apple make their augmented reality play this year or next they will keep their system
closed off as this tends to be their business model. Theo Priestly, CEO at Metanomics
points out that Chinese Giant Tencent are doing similar, and he cited Figure 7.1; building
a closed but tightly linked suite of businesses into something that looks like a metaverse.
The levels of investment which are being hung under the metaverse moniker are mind
blowing, but that is not what we want to discuss as an end point for this book. For our
purposes in this product design the interface between the previous chapter (NFTs) and this
metaverse chapter is crucial. Punk6529 is a pseudonymous twitter account and thought
leader in the “crypto” space. The text below encapsulates much of the reasoning that led to
this book and product exploration, and is paraphrased from this thread for our purposes.
Bit by bit, the visualization layer of the internet will get better until it is unrecognisably
better (+/- 10 years). As the visualization layer of the internet gets better, digital objects
will become more useful and more important. Avatars (2D and 3D), art, schoolwork,
work work, 3D virtual spaces and hundreds of other things. Not only will the objects
themselves become more important, they will lead to different emergent behaviours. We see
this already with avatars and mixed eponymous/pseudonymous/anonymous communities.
Yes, it is the internet plumbing underneath, but just like social media changed human
behaviour on the internet, metaverse type experiences will further change it. NFT Twitter
+ Discord + various virtual worlds is a form of early metaverse. I feel like I am entering a
different world here, not just some websites. The most important question for the health of
the internet/metaverse/human society in the 2030s will be decided now. And that question
is: "who stores the deﬁnitive ownership records of those digital objects". There are
two answers: a company’s database OR a blockchain. If we end up with "a company’s
database" we will end up with all the web2 dysfunctions, but worse. SMTP is an open
protocol that anyone can use so we don’t have societal level ﬁghts on "who is allowed to
use email". Short messaging online ended up becoming Twitter. So we end up having the

7.1 Toward an open metaverse

110

Figure 7.1: McCormick attempts to guess the Tencent metaverse

most absurd, surreal discussions on the topic of "who is allowed to use short-messaging"
being dependant on "who is the CEO of Twitter". There is no way this is the correct
architecture for our progressively more digital economy.... If this is your ﬁrst time around
here, we are ﬁghting for an open metaverse.”

It seems that industry shares much of this opinion regarding an open metaverse. The
proposal of a persistent interactive digital universe online is so vast that major players
recognise that they will not be able to monopolise this space, though Facebook/Meta are
clearly attempting to. The Metaverse Standards Forum is clearly an attempt by the other
industry players to catch up and then get out ahead of Meta in this regard. It’s also possible
to view this as just another land grab, but through the vehicle of a standards body. Time
will tell. They say:

“Announced today, The Metaverse Standards Forum brings together leading standards
organizations and companies for industry-wide cooperation on interoperability standards
needed to build the open metaverse. The Forum will explore where the lack of interoper-
ability is holding back metaverse deployment and how the work of Standards Developing
Organizations (SDOs) deﬁning and evolving needed standards may be coordinated and
accelerated. Open to any organization at no cost, the Forum will focus on pragmatic,
action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and
open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of metaverse standards, while
also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines.”

This looks like it will be a useful project and community for the purposes outlined in
this book, but the technology is young enough (in that it doesn’t really exist) for multiple
approaches to be trailed.

7.1 Toward an open metaverse

111

Europe is making metaverse a priority with The Virtual and Augmented Reality Indus-
trial Coalition. President von der Leyen’s State of the Union letter of intent says: “We will
continue looking at new digital opportunities and trends, such as the metaverse.”

7.1.1 Primitives

OpenAI identiﬁed the following 5 points about metaverse, in response to the query “What
are 5 key points I should know when studying metaverse?”

• Metaverse is a virtual reality platform that allows users to interact with each other

and with digital objects in a virtual space.

• Metaverse is a decentralized platform, meaning that there is no central authority or

server that controls the platform.

• Metaverse is an open platform, meaning that anyone can develop applications for

the platform.

• Metaverse is a secure platform, meaning that all data and transactions are encrypted

and secure.

• Metaverse is a scalable platform, meaning that it can support a large number of users

and a large number of transactions.

This is an unexpectedly great answer, probably the cleanest we have found. The Metaverse
Standard Forum highlights the following, which reads like the output from a brainstorm
between academia and industry stakeholders.

• collaborative spatial computing
• interactive 3D graphics
• augmented and virtual reality
• photorealistic content authoring
• geospatial systems
• end-user content tooling
• digital twins
• real-time collaboration
• physical simulation
• online economies
• multi-user gaming
• new levels of scale and immersiveness.

– Interoperable
– Open
– Hardware agnostic
– Network
• Technologies

– Virtual reality
– Augmented reality
– Mixed reality

• Affordances

– Immersive
– Embodiment

It’s not a useless list by any means, but it lacks the kind of product focus we need for
detailed exploration of value and trust transfer.
Mystakidis identiﬁes the following [103]:
• Principles

7.1 Toward an open metaverse

112

– Presence
– Identity construction

• Challenges

– Physical well-being
– Psychology
– Ethics
– Privacy

This is quite an academic list. A lot of these words will be explored in the next section
which is more of an academic literature review.

Nevelsteen attempted to identify key elements for a ‘virtual work’ in 2018 and these

are relevant now, and described rigorously in the appendix of his paper [104]:

• Shared Temporality, meaning that the distributed users of the virtual world share the

same frame of time.

• Real time which he deﬁnes as “not turn based”.
• Shared Spatiality, which he says can include an ‘allegory’ of a space, as in text
adventures. It seems this might extend to a spoken interface to a mixed reality
metaverse.

• ONE Shard is a description of the WLAN network architecture, and conforms to

servers in a connected open metaverse.

• Many human agents simply means that more than one person can be represented in

the virtual world and corresponds to ‘social’ in our description.

• Many Software Agents corresponds to AI actors in our descriptions. Non playing

characters would be the gaming equivalent.

• Virtual Interaction pertains to any ability of a user to interact actively with the

persistent virtual scene, and is pretty much a given these days.
• Nonpausable isn’t even a word, but is pretty self explanatory.
• Persistence means that if human participants leave then the data of the virtual world
continues. This applies to the scenes, the data representing actions, and objects and
actors in the worlds.

• Avatar is interesting as it might seem that having avatar representations of connected
human participants is a given. In fact the shared spaces employed by Nvidia for
digital engineering do not.

Turning to industry; John Riccitiello, CEO of Unity Technologies says that metaverse is
“The next generation of the internet that is:

• always real-time
• mostly 3D
• mostly interactive
• mostly social
• mostly persistent”
Expanding this slightly we will us the following primitives of what we think are

important for a metaverse:

• Fusing of digital and real life
• Social ﬁrst
• Real time interactive 3d graphics ﬁrst
• Persistent
• Supports ownership
• Supports user generated content [105]

7.2 History

113

• Open and extensible
• Low friction economic actors and actions
• Trusted / secure
• Convergence of ﬁlm and games
• Blurring of IP boundaries
• Blurring of narrative ﬂow
• Multimodal and hardware agnostic
• Mobile ﬁrst experiences
• Safeguarding, and governance

There is a lot of work for the creative and technical industries to do to integrate human
narrative creativity this nascent metaverse, and it’s not even completely clear that this is
possible, or even what people want.

7.2 History

The word metaverse was coined by the author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snowcrash.
It started popping up soon after in news articles and research papers [106], but in the last
ﬁve years it has been ﬁnding a new life within a silicon valley narrative. Perhaps in re-
sponse to this Stephenson is now working with a company called Lamina1 which actually
looks a lot like the rest of this book, so perhaps we have been on the right track.

There were clear precursors to modern social VR, such as VRML in the 1990’s which

laid much of the groundwork for 3D content over networked computers.

It might seem that there would be a clear path from there to now, in terms of a metaverse
increasingly meaning connected social virtual spaces, but this has not happened. Instead
interest in metaverse as a concept waned, MMORG (described later) ﬁlled in the utility,
and then recently an entirely new deﬁnition emerged. Park and Kim surveyed dozens of
different historical interpretations of the word, and the generational reboot they describe
makes it even less clear [107]. The concept of the Metaverse is extremely plastic at this
time (Figure 7.2).

It’s arguable that what will be expanding in this chapter is more appropriately ‘Cy-
berspace’ as described by William Gibson in Neuromancer [108] “A global domain within
the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information
systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer
systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”

Park and Kim identify the generational inﬂection point which has led to the resurgence
of the concept of Metaverse [107]: “Unlike previous studies on the Metaverse based on
Second Life, the current Metaverse is based on the social value of Generation Z that online
and ofﬁne selves are not different.”

Brett Leonard, writer director of Lawnmower Man talks about the pressing need to get
out in front of moral questions in the development of metaverse applications. He stressed
that wellbeing will be a crucial underpinning of the technology because of the inherent
intimacy of immersion in virtual spaces. He suggests that emotional engagement with
storied characters is needed to satisfy the human need for narrative, and that this should
be utopian by design to stave off the worst of dystopian emergent characteristics of the
technology.

The book will aim to build toward an understanding of metaverse as a useful social
mixed reality, that allows low friction communication and economic activity, within groups,

biggest shareholder, and has been vocal about Web2 censorship on the platform.

at a global scale. Cryptography and distributed software can assist us with globally ‘true’
persistence of digital data, so we will look to integrate this with our social XR. This focus
on persistence, value, and trust means it’s most appropriate to focus on business uses as
there is more opportunity for value creation which will be important to bootstrap this
technology.

This chapter will ﬁrst attempt to frame the context for telepresence (the academic
term for communicating through technology), and then explain the increasingly polarised
options for metaverse. It’s useful to precisely identify the primitives of the product we
would like to see here, so this chapter is far more a review of academic literature in the
ﬁeld, culminating in a proposed framework.

7.3 Video conferencing, the status quo

Video-conferencing has become more popular as technology improves, as it gets better
integrated with ubiquitous cloud business support suites, and as a function of the global
pandemic and changing work patterns. There is obviously increasing demands for real-time
communication across greater distances.

The full effects of video-conferencing on human communication are still being ex-
plored, as seen in the experimental “Together Mode” within Microsoft Teams. Video-
conferencing is presumed to be a somewhat richer form of communication than email and
telephone, but not quite as informative as face-to-face communication.

In this section we look at the inﬂuence of eye contact on communication and how
video-conferencing mediates both verbal and non-verbal interactions. Facilitation of eye
contact is a challenge that must be addressed so that video-conferencing can approach the
rich interactions of face-to-face communication. This is an even bigger problem in the
emerging metaverse systems, so it’s important that we examine the history and trajectory.
There is a tension emerging for companies who do not necessarily need to employ
remote meeting technology, but also cannot afford to ignore the competitive advantages
that such systems bring. In an experiment preformed well before the 2020 global pandemic
at CTrip, Bloom et al describe how home working led to a 13% performance increase, of
which about 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick-days)

7.3 Video conferencing, the status quo

115

and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter working environment) [109].
Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover, but
their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. This speaks to a lack of management
capability with such systemic change. It’s clearly a complex and still barely understood
change within business and management.

Due to the success of the experiment, CTrip rolled-out the option to work from home
to the whole company, and allowed the experimental employees to re-select between the
home or ofﬁce. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains almost
doubling to 22%. This highlights the beneﬁts of learning and selection effects when
adopting modern management practices like working from home. Increasingly this is
becoming a choice issue for prospective employees, and an advantage for hiring managers
to be able to offer it.

More recent research by Barrero, Bloom and Davies found that working from home is

likely to be “sticky” [110]. They found:

• better-than-expected WFH experiences,
• new investments in physical and human capital that enable WFH,
• greatly diminished stigma associated with WFH,
• lingering concerns about crowds and contagion risks,
• a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH.

More recently Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS) provide rich document manage-
ment, sharing, and collaboration functionality across an organisation. The enterprise ECS
system may integrate collaborative video [111]. This is for instance the case with Microsoft
Teams / Sharepoint. This integration of ECS should be considered when thinking about
social VR systems which wish to support business, value, and trust. It is very much the
case that large technology providers are attempting to integrate their ‘business back end’
systems into their emerging metaverse systems. Open source equivalents are currently
lacking.

7.3.1 Pandemic drives adoption

The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic is changing how people work, toward a new
global ‘normal’. Some ways of working are overdue transformation, and will be naturally
disrupted. In the UK at least it seems that there may be real appetite to shift away from old
practises. This upheaval will inevitably present both challenges and opportunities.

Highly technical workforces, especially, can operate from anywhere. The post pan-
demic world seems to have stronger national border controls, with a resultant shortage of
highly technical staff. This has forced the hand of global business toward internationally
distributed teams.

If only a small percentage of companies allow the option of remote working, then
they gain a structural advantage, enjoying beneﬁts of reduced travel, lower workplace
infection risk across all disease, and global agility for the personnel. Building and estate
costs will certainly be reduced. More diversity may be possible. Issues such as sexual
harassment and bullying may be reduced. With reduced overheads product quality may
increase. If customers are happier with their services, then over time this ‘push’ may mean
an enormous shift away from centralised working practises toward distributed working.

Technologies which support this working style were still in their infancy at the begin-
ning of the pandemic. The rush to ‘Zoom’, a previously relatively unknown and insecure
[112] web meeting product, shows how naive businesses were in this space.

7.3 Video conferencing, the status quo

116

Connection of multiple users is now far better supported, with Zoom and Mircosoft
Teams alone supporting hundreds of millions of chats a day. This is a 20x increase on
market leader Skype’s 2013 ﬁgure of 280 million connections per month. Such technologies
extend traditional telephony to provide important multi sensory cues. However, these
technologies demonstrate shortfalls compared to a live face-to-face meeting, which is
generally agreed to be optimal for human-human interaction [113].

While the research community and business are learning how to adapt working prac-
tises to web based telepresence [114], there remains little technology support for ad-hoc
serendipitous meetings between small groups. It’s possible that Metaverse applications
can help to ﬁll this gap, by gamiﬁcation of social spaces, but the under discussed problems
with video conferencing are likely to be even worse in such systems.

Chris Herd of “FirstBase” (who admittedly have a bias) provides some fascinating

speculations:

“I’ve spoken to 2,000+ companies with 40M+ employees about remote work in the

last 12 months A few predictions of what will happen before 2030:

• Rural Living: World-class people will move to smaller cities, have a lower cost of

living & higher quality of life.

7.3.2 Point to Point Video Conferencing

O’Malley et al. showed that face-to-face and video mediated employed visual cues for
mutual understanding, and that addition of video to the audio channel aided conﬁdence
and mutual understanding. However, video mediated did not provide the clear cues of
being co-located [115].

Dourish et al. make a case for not using face-to-face as a baseline for comparison, but
rather that analysis of the efﬁcacy of remote tele-collaboration tools should be made in
a wider context of connected multimedia tools and ‘emergent communicative practises’
[116]. While this is an interesting viewpoint it does not necessarily map well to a recreation
of the ad-hoc meeting.

There is established literature on human sensitivity to eye contact in both 2D and 3D
VC [117, 118], with an accepted minimum of 5-10 degrees before observers can reliably
sense they are not being looked at [119]. Roberts et al. suggested that at the limit of social
gaze distance ( 4m) the maximum angular separation between people standing shoulder to
shoulder in the real world would be around 4 degrees[120].

Sellen found limited impact on turn passing when adding a visual channel to audio
between two people when using Hydra, an early system which provided multiple video
conference displays in an intuitive spatial distribution[121]. She did however, ﬁnd that the
design of the video system affected the ability to hold multi-party conversations [122].

Monk and Gale describe in detail experiments which they used for examining gaze
awareness in communication which is mediated and unmediated by technology. They
found that gaze awareness increased message understanding [123].

Both Kuster et al. and Gemmel et al. have successfuly demonstrated software systems
which can adjust eye gaze to correct for off axis capture in real time video systems[124,
125].

Shahid et al. conducted a study on pairs of children playing games with and without
video mediation and concluded that the availability of mutual gaze affordance enriched
social presence and fun, while its absence dramatically affects the quality of the interaction.
They used the ‘Networked Minds’, a social presence questionnaire.

7.3.3 Triadic and Small Group

Early enthusiasm in the 1970’s for video conferencing, as a medium for small group
interaction quickly turned to disillusionment. It was agreed after a ﬂurry of initial research
that the systems at the time offered no particular advantage over audio only communication,
and at considerable cost [126].

Something in the breakdown of normal visual cues seems to impact the ability of the

7.3 Video conferencing, the status quo

118

technology to support ﬂowing group interaction. Nonetheless, some non-verbal communi-
cation is supported in VC with limited success.

Additional screens and cameras can partially overcome the limitation of no multi-party
support (that of addressing a room full of people on a single screen) by making available
more bidirectional channels. For instance, every remote user can be a head on a screen
with a corresponding camera. The positioning of the screens must then necessarily match
the physical organization of the remote room.

Egido provides an early review of the failure of VC for group activity, with the
“misrepresentation of the technology as a substitute for face-to-face" still being valid today
[127].

Commercial systems such as Cisco Telepresence Rooms cluster their cameras above the
centre screen of three for meetings using their telecollaboration product, while admitting
that this only works well for the central seat of the three screens. They also group multiple
people on a single screen in what Workhoven et al. dub a “non-isotropic" conﬁguration
[128]. They maintain that this is a suitable trade off as the focus of the meeting is more
generally toward the important contributor in the central seat. This does not necessarily
follow for less formal meeting paradigms.

In small groups, it is more difﬁcult to align non-verbal cues between all parties,
and at the same time, it is more important because the hand-offs between parties are
more numerous and important in groups. A breakdown in conversational ﬂow in such
circumstances is harder to solve. A perception of the next person to talk must be resolved
for all parties and agreed upon to some extent.

However, most of the conventional single camera, and expensive multi camera VC
systems, suffer a fundamental limitation in that the offset between the camera sight lines
and the lines of actual sight introduce incongruities that the brain must compensate for
[113].

7.3.4 Other Systems to Support Business

There have been many attempts to support group working and rich data sharing between
dispersed groups in a business setting. So called ’smart spaces’ allow interaction with
different displays for different activities and add in some ability to communicate with
remote or even mobile collaborators on shared documents [129], with additional challenges
for multi-disciplinary groups who are perhaps less familiar with one or more of the
technology barriers involved [130].

Early systems like clearboard [131] demonstrated the potential for smart whiteboards
with a webcam component for peer-to-peer collaborative working. Indeed it is possible to
support this modality with Skype and a smartboard system (and up to deployments such as
Accessgrid). They remain relatively unpopular however.

7.3.5 Mona Lisa Type Effects

Almost all traditional group video meeting tools suffer from the so-called Mona Lisa effect
which describes the phenomenon where the apparent gaze of a portrait or 2 dimensional
image always appears to look at the observer regardless of the observer’s position [132,
133, 134]. This situation manifests when the painted or imaged subject is looking into the
camera or at the eyes of the painter [135, 136].

Single user-to-user systems based around bidirectional video implicitly align the user’s

7.4 What’s important for human communication

119

gaze by constraining the camera to roughly the same location as the display. When viewed
away from this ideal axis, it creates the feeling of being looked at regardless of where this
observer is [137, 132, 133, 134], or the “collapsed view effect” [138] where perception of
gaze transmitted from a 2 dimensional image or video is dependent on the incidence of
originating gaze to the transmission medium.

Multiple individuals using one such channel can feel as if they are being looked at
simultaneously, leading to a breakdown in the normal non-verbal communication which
mediates turn passing [139]. There is research investigating this sensitivity when the
gaze is mediated by a technology, ﬁnding that “disparity between the optical axis of the
camera and the looking direction of a looker should be at most 1.2 degrees in the horizontal
direction, and 1.7 degrees in vertical direction to support eye contact" [118, 140]. It seems
that humans assume that they are being looked at unless they are sure that they are not
[119].

To be clear, there are technological solutions to this problem, but it’s useful in the
context of discussing metaverse to know that this problem exists. It’s known that there
are cognitive dissonances around panes of video conference images, but it seems that the
effect is truely limited to 2D surfaces. A 3D projection surface (a physical model of a
human) designed to address this problem completely removed the Mona Lisa effect [137].
Metaverse then perhaps offers the promise of solving this, making more natural inter-
action possible, but it’s clearly a long way from delivering on those promises right now.
We need to understand what’s important and try to map these into a metaverse product.

7.4 What’s important for human communication

7.4.1 Vocal

The ubiquitous technology to mediate conversation is, of course, the telephone. The 2021
Ericsson mobility report states that there are around 8 billion mobile subscriptions globally.
More people have access to mobile phones than to working toilets according to UNICEF.
Joupii and Pan designed a system which focused attention on spatially correct high
deﬁnition audio. They found “signiﬁcant improvement over traditional audio conferencing
technology, primarily due to the increased dynamic range and directionality. [141]. Aoki
et al. also describe an audio only system with support for spatial cues [142].

In the following sections we will attempt to rigorously identify just what is important
for our proposed application of business centric communication, supportive of trust, and
thereby value transfer.

In his book ‘Bodily Communication’ [143] Michael Argyle divides vocal signals into

the following categories:

1. Verbal
2. Non-Verbal Vocalisations

a. Linked to Speech
i. Prosodic
ii. Synchronising
iii. Speech Disturbances

b. Independent of Speech
i. Emotional Noises
ii. Paralinguistic (emotion and interpersonal attitudes)
iii. Personal voice and quality of accent

7.4 What’s important for human communication

120

Additional to the semantic content of verbal communication there is a rich layer of meaning
in pauses, gaps, and overlaps [144] which help to mediate who is speaking and who is
listening in multi-party conversation. This mediation of turn passing, to facilitate ﬂow, is by
no means a given and is highly dependent on context and other factors [145]. Interruptions
are also a major factor in turn passing.

This extra-verbal content [146] extends into physical cues, so-called ‘nonverbal’ cues,
and there are utterances which link the verbal and non-verbal [147]. This will be discussed
later, but to an extent, it is impossible to discuss verbal communication without regard to
the implicit support which exists around the words themselves.

In the context of all technology-mediated conversation the extra-verbal is easily com-
promised if technology used to support communication over a distance does not convey
the information, or conveys it badly. This can introduce additional complexity [147].

These support structures are pretty much lacking in metaverse XR systems. The goal
then here perhaps is to examine the state-of-the-art, and remove as many of the known
barriers as possible. Such a process might better support trust, which might better support
the kind of economic and activity we seek to engineer.

When examining just verbal / audio communication technology it can be assumed
that the physical non-verbal cues are lost, though not necessarily unused. In the absence
of non-verbal cues it falls to timely vocal signals to take up the slack when framing and
organising the turn passing. For the synchronising of vocal signals between the parties to
be effective the systemic delays must remain small. System latency, the inherent delays
added by the communication technology, can allow slips or a complete breakdown of
’ﬂow’ [148]. This problem can be felt in current social VR platforms, though people don’t
necessarily identify the cause of the breakdown correctly. In the main they feel to the users
like a bad “audio-only” teleconference.

With that said, the transmission of verbal / audio remains the most critical element
for interpersonal communication as the most essential meaning is encoded semantically.
There is a debate about ratios of how much information is conveyed through the various
human channels [149], but it is reasonable to infer from its ubiquity that support for audio
is essential for meaningful communication over a distance. We have seen that it must be
timely, to prevent a breakdown of framing, and preferably have sufﬁcient ﬁdelity to convey
sub-vocal utterances.

For social immersive VR for business users, a real-time network such as websockets,
RTP, or UDP seems essential, much better microphones are important, and the system
should support both angular spatialisation, and respond to distance between interlocutors.

7.4.2 Nonverbal

We have already seen that verbal exchanges take place in a wider context of sub vocal
and physical cues. In addition, the spatial relationship between the parties, their focus of
attention, their gestures and actions, and the wider context of their environment all play a
part in communication [150]. These are identiﬁed as follows by Gillies and Slater [151] in
their paper on virtual agents.
• Posture and gesture
• Facial expression
• Gaze
• Proxemics
• Head position and orientation

7.4 What’s important for human communication

121

• Interactional synchrony
This is clearly important for our proposed metaverse application. Below we will

examine these six areas by looking across the wider available research.

7.4.2.1 Gaze

Of particular importance is judgement of eye gaze which is normally fast, accurate and
automatic, operating at multiple levels of cognition through multiple cues [143, 152, 153,
152, 154, 155, 123].

Gaze in particular aids smooth turn passing [156] [157] and lack of support for eye

gaze has been found to decrease the efﬁciency of turn passing by 25% [158].

There are clear patterns to eye gaze in groups, with the person talking, or being talked
to, probably also being looked at [159] [160]. To facilitate this groups will tend to position
themselves to maximally enable observation of the gaze of the other parties [155]. This
intersects with proxemics which will be discussed shortly. In general people look most
when they are listening, with short glances of 3-10 seconds [153]. Colburn et al. suggest
that gaze direction and the perception of the gaze of others directly impacts social cognition
[161] and this has been supported in a follow up study [162].

The importance of gaze is clearly so signiﬁcant in evolutionary terms that human acuity
for eye direction is considered high at 30 sec arc [163] with straight binocular gaze judged
more accurately than straight monocular gaze [164], when using stereo vision.

Regarding the judgement of the gaze of others, Symons et al. suggested that “people
are remarkably sensitive to shifts in a person’s eye gaze” in triadic conversation [163].
This perception of the gaze of others operates at a low level and is automatic. Langton
et al. cite research stating that the gaze of others is “able to trigger reﬂexive shifts of an
observer’s visual attention” and further discuss the deep biological underpinnings of gaze
processing [160].

When discussing technology-mediated systems, Vertegaal & Ding suggested that
understanding the effects of gaze on triadic conversation is “crucial for the design of
teleconferencing systems and collaborative virtual environments” [139], and further found
correlation between the amount of gaze, and amount of speech. Vertegaal & Slagter
suggest that “gaze function(s) as an indicator of conversational attention in multiparty
conversations” [159]. It seems like is we are to have useful markets within social immersive
environments then support for natural gaze effects should be a priority.

Wilson et al. found that subjects can “discriminate gaze focused on adjacent faces up to
[3.5m]” [165]. This perhaps gives us a testable benchmark within a metaverse application
which is eye gaze enabled. In this regard Schrammel et al. investigated to what extent
embodied agents can elicit the same responses in eye gaze detection [166].

Vertegaal et al. found that task performace was 46% better when gaze was synchronised
in their telepresence scenario. As they point out, gaze synchonisation (temporal and spatial)
is ‘commendable’ in all such group situations, but the precise utility will depend upon the
task [139].

There has been some success in the automatic detection of the focus of attention of
participants in multi party meetings [167, 168]. More recently, eye tracking technologies
allow the recording and replaying of accurate eye gaze information [169] alongside
information about pupil dilation toward determination of honesty and social presence [170].
It seems there are trust and honesty issues conﬂated with how collaborants in a virtual
space are represented.

7.4 What’s important for human communication

122

In summary, gaze awareness does not just mediate verbal communication but rather is
a complex channel of communication in its own right. Importantly, gaze has a controlling
impact on those who are involved in the communication at any one time, including and
excluding even beyond the current participants. Perhaps the systems we propose in this
book need to demand eye gaze support, but it is clear that it should be recommended, and
that the software selected should support the technology integration in principle.

7.4.2.2 Mutual Gaze

Aygyle and Cook established early work around gaze and mutual gaze, with their seminal
book of the same title [152], additionally detailing confounding factors around limitations
and inaccuracies in observance of gaze and how this varies with distance [154, 143, 171].
Mutual gaze is considered to be the most sophisticated form of gaze awareness with
signiﬁcant impact on dyadic conversation especially [171, 145, 172]. The effects seem
more profound than just helping to mediate ﬂow and attention, with mutual eye gaze aiding
in memory recall and the formation of impressions [173].

While reconnection of mutual eye gaze through a technology boundary does not
seem completely necessary it is potentially important, with impact on subtle elements
of one-to-one communication, and therefore discrimination of eye gaze direction should
be bi-directional if possible, and if possible have sufﬁcient accuracy to judge direct eye
contact. In their review Bohannon et al. said that the issue of rejoining eye contact must be
addressed in order to fully realise the richness of simulating face-to-face encounters [173].
Mutual gaze is a challenging affordance as bi-directional connection of gaze is not a
trivial problem. It’s perhaps best to view this as at the ‘edge’ of our requirements for a
metaverse.

7.4.2.3 Mutual Gaze in Telepresence

We have seen that transmission of attention can broadly impact communication in subtle
ways, impacting empathy, trust, cognition, and co-working patterns. Mutual gaze (look-
ing into one another’s eyes), is currently the high water mark for technology-mediated
conversation.

Many attempts have been made to re-unite mutual eye gaze when using tele-conferencing
systems. In their 2015 review of approaches Regenbrecht and Langlotz found that none of
the methods they examined were completely ideal [174]. They found most promise in 2D
and 3D interpolation techniques, which will be discussed in detail later, but they opined
that such systems were very much ongoing research and lacked sufﬁcient optimisation.

A popular approach uses the so called ’Peppers Ghost’ phenomenon [175], where a
semi silvered mirror presents an image to the eye of the observer, but allows a camera
to view through from behind the angled mirror surface. The earliest example of this is
Rosental’s two way television system in 1947 [176], though Buxton et al. ‘Reciprocal
Video Tunnel’ from 1992 is more often cited [177]. This optical characteristic isn’t
supported by retroreﬂective projection technology, and besides requires careful control of
light levels either side of the semi-silvered surface.

The early GAZE-2 system (which makes use of Pepper’s ghost) is novel in that it
uses an eye tracker to select the correct camera from several trained on the remote user.
This ensures that the correct returned gaze (within the ability of the system) is returned
to the correct user on the other end of the network [178]. Mutual gaze capability is later
highlighted as an affordance supported or unsupported by key research and commercial
systems.

7.4 What’s important for human communication

123

7.4.2.4 Head Orientation

Orientation of the head (judged by the breaking of bilateral symmetry and alignment of
nose) is a key factor when judging attention. Perception of head orientation can be judged
to within a couple of degrees [165].

It has been established that head gaze can be detected all the way out to the extremis
of peripheral vision, with accurate eye gaze assessment only achievable in central vision
[135]. This is less of use for our metaverses at this time, because user ﬁeld of view is
almost always restricted in such systems. More usefully, features of illumination can alter
the apparent orientation of the head [179].

Head motion over head orientation is a more nuanced propostion and can be considered
a micro gesture [180]. Head tracking systems within head mounted displays can certainly
detect these tiny movements, but it’s clear that not all of this resolution is passed into
shared virtual settings through avatars. It would be beneﬁcial to be able to ﬁne tune this
feature within any software selected.

It is possible that 3D displays are better suited to perception of head gaze since it is

suggested that they are more suitable for “shape understanding tasks” [181]

Bailenson, Baell, and Blascovich found that giving avatars rendered head movements
in a shared virtual environment decreased the amount of talking, possibly as the extra
channel of head gaze was opened up. They also reported that subjectively, communication
was enhanced [182].

Clearly head orientation is an important indicator of the direction of attention of
members of a group and can be discerned even in peripheral vision. This allows the focus
of several parties to be followed simultaneously and is an important affordance to replicate
on any multi-party communication system.

7.4.2.5 Combined Head and Eye Gaze

Rienks et al. found that head orientation alone does not provide a reliable cue for identiﬁ-
cation of the speaker in a multiparty setting [183]. Stiefelhagen & Zhu found “that head
orientation contributes 68.9% to the overall gaze direction on average” [168], though head
and eye gaze seem to be judged interdependently [164]. Langton noted that head and eye
gaze are “mutually inﬂuential in the analysis of social attention” [160], and it is clear that
transmission of ‘head gaze’ by any mediating system, enhances rather than replaces timely
detection of subtle cues. Combined head and eye gaze give the best of both worlds and
extend the lateral ﬁeld of view in which attention can be reliably conveyed to others [135].

7.4.2.6 Other Upper Body: Overview

While it is well evidenced that there are advantages to accurate connection of the gaze
between conversational partners [154, 145], there is also a body of evidence that physical
communication channels extend beyond the face [145, 184] and include both micro (shrugs,
hands and arms), and macro movement of the upper body [185]. Goldin-Meadow suggests
that gesturing aids conversational ﬂow by resolving mismatches and aiding cognition
[186].

In their technology-mediated experiment which compared face to upper body and face
on a ﬂat screen, Nguyen and Canny found that “upper-body framing improves empathy
measures and gives results not signiﬁcantly different from face-to-face under several
empathy measures” [184].

The upper body can be broken up as follows:

7.4 What’s important for human communication

124

Facial

Much emotional context can be described by facial expression (display) alone [185, 187],
with smooth transition between expressions seemingly important [188]. This suggests
that mediating technologies should support high temporal resolution, or at least that there
is a minimum resolution between which transitions between expressions become too
’categorical’. Some aspects of conversational ﬂow appear to be mediated in part by facial
expression [189]. There are gender differences in the perception of facial affect [190].

Gesturing

(such as pointing at objects) paves the way for more complex channels of human commu-
nication and is a basic and ubiquitous channel [191]. Conversational hand gestures provide
a powerful additional augmentation to verbal content [192].

Posture

Some emotions can be conveyed through upper body conﬁgurations alone. Argyle details
some of these [143] and makes reference to the posture of the body and the arrangement of
the arms (i.e. folded across the chest). These are clearly important cues. Kleinsmith and
Bianchi-Berthouze assert that "some affective expressions may be better communicated by
the body than the face" [193].

Body Torque

In multi-party conversation, body torque, that is the rotation of the trunk from front facing,
can convey aspects of attention and focus [194].

In summary, visual cues which manifest on the upper body and face can convey

meaning, mediate conversation, direct attention, and augment verbal utterances.

7.4.2.7 Effect of Shared Objects on Gaze

Ou et al. detail shared task eye gaze behaviour “in which helpers seek visual evidence for
workers’ understanding when they lack conﬁdence of that understanding, either from a
shared, or common vocabulary” [195].

Murray et al. found that in virtual environments, eye gaze is crucial for discerning

what a subject is looking at [196]. This work is shown in Figure 7.3.

It is established that conversation around a shared object or task, especially a complex
one, mitigates gaze between parties [152] and this suggests that in some situations around
shared tasks in metaverses it may be appropriate to reduce ﬁdelity of representation of the
avatars.

7.4.2.8 Tabletop and Shared Task

In early telepresence research Buxton and William argued through examples that “effective
telepresence depends on quality sharing of both person and task space [177].

In their triadic shared virtual workspace Tang et al. found difﬁculty in reading shared
text using a ‘round the table’ conﬁguration, a marked preference for working collaboratively
on the same side of the table. They also found additional confusion as to the identity of
remote participants [197]. Tse et al. found that pairs can work well over a shared digital
tabletop, successfully overcoming a single user interface to interleave tasks [198].

Tang et al. demonstrate that collaborators engage and disengage around a group activity
through several distinct, recognizable mechanisms with unique characteristics [199]. They
state that tabletop interfaces should offer a variety of tools to facilitate this ﬂuidity.

Camblend is a shared workspace with panoramic high resolution video. It maintains
some spatial cues between locations by keeping a shared object in the video feeds [200,
201]. Participants successfully resolved co-orientation within the system.

7.5 Psychology of Technology-Mediated Interaction

125

Figure 7.3: Eye tracked eye gaze awareness in VR. Murray et al. used immersive and semi
immersive systems alongside eye trackers to examine the ability of two avatars to detect
the gaze awareness of a similarly immersed collaborator.

The t-room system implemented by Luff et al. surrounds co-located participants stand-
ing at a shared digital table with life sized body and head video representations of remote
collaborators [202] but found that there were incongruities in the spatial and temporal
matching between the collaborators which broke the ﬂow of conversation. Tuddenham et al.
found that co-located collaborators naturally devolved ’territory’ of working when sharing
a task space, and that this did not happen the same way with a tele-present collaborator
[203]. Instead remote collaboration adapted to use a patchwork of ownership of a shared
task. It seems obvious to say that task ownership is a function of working space, but it
is interesting that the research found no measurable difference in performance when the
patchwork coping strategy was employed.

The nature of a shared collaborative task and/or interface directly impacts the style
of interaction between collaborators. This will have a bearing on the choice of task for
experimentation [204, 205].

7.5 Psychology of Technology-Mediated Interaction

7.5.1 Proxemics

Proxemics is the formal study of the regions of interpersonal space begun in the late 50’s
by Hall and Sommers and building toward The Hidden Dimension [206], which details
bands of space (Figure 7.4) that are implicitly and instinctively created by humans and
which have a direct bearing on communication. Distance between conversational partners,
and afﬁliation, also have a bearing on the level of eye contact [153] with a natural distance
equilibrium being established and developed throughout, through both eye contact and a

7.5 Psychology of Technology-Mediated Interaction

126

variety of subtle factors. Argyle & Ingham provide levels of expected gaze and mutual
gaze against distance [154]. These boundaries are altered by ethnicity [207, 143] and
somewhat by gender [208], and age [209, 190].

Even with signiﬁcant abstraction by communication systems (such as SecondLife)
social norms around personal space persist [210, 211, 212]. Bailenson & Blascovich
found that even in Immersive Collaborative Virtual Environments (ICVE’s) “participants
respected personal space of the humanoid representation”[211] implying that this is a
deeply held ’low-level’ psychophysical reaction [213]. The degree to which this applies to
non-humanoid avatars seems under explored.

Maeda et al. [214] found that seating position impacts the level of engagement in
teleconferencing. Taken together with the potential for reconﬁguration within the group as
well as perhaps signalling for the attention of participants outside of the conﬁnes of the
group in an open business metaverse setting.

When considering the attention of engaging with people outside the conﬁnes of a

7.5 Psychology of Technology-Mediated Interaction

127

meeting Hager et al. found that gross expressions can be resolved by humans over long
distances [215, 143]. It seems that social interaction begins around 7.5m in the so-called
‘public space’ [206]. Recreating this affordance in a metaverse would be a function of the
display resolution, and seems another ‘stretch goal’ rather than a core requirement.

7.5.2 Attention

The study of attention is a discrete branch of psychology. It is the study of cognitive
selection toward a subjective or objective sub focus, to the relative exclusion of other
stimulae. It has been deﬁned as “a range of neural operations that selectively enhance
processing of information” [216]. In the context of interpersonal communication it can
be reﬁned to apply to selectively favouring a conversational agent or object or task above
other stimuli in the contextual frame.

Humans can readily determine the focus of attention of others in their space [167] and
preservation of the spatial cues which support this are important for technology-mediated
communication [121] [168].

The interplay between conversational partners, especially the reciprocal perception of

attention, is dubbed the perceptual crossing [217, 218].

This is a complex ﬁeld of study with gender, age, and ethnicity all impacting the
behaviour of interpersonal attention [219, 209, 143, 190, 220]. Vertegaal has done a
great deal of work on awareness and attention in technology-mediated situations and the
work of his group is cited throughout this chapter [221]. As an example it is still such
a challenge to “get” attention through mediated channels of communication, that some
research [222, 121] and many commercial systems such as ‘blackboard collaborate’, Zoom,
and Teams use tell tale signals (such as a microphone icon) to indicate when a participant
is actively contributing. Some are automatic, but many are still manual, requiring that a
user effectively hold up a virtual hand to signal their wish to communicate.

Langton et al. cite research stating that the gaze of others is “able to trigger reﬂexive

shifts of an observer’s visual attention”.

Regarding the attention of others, Fagal et el demonstrated that eye visibility impacts
collaborative task performance when considering a shared task [172]. Novick et al.
performed analysis on task hand-off gaze patterns which is useful for extension into shared
task product design [157].

7.5.3 Behaviour

Hedge et al. suggested that gaze interactions between strangers and friends may be different
which could have an impact on the kinds of interactions a metaverse might best support
[156]. Voida et al. elaborate that prior relationships can cause “internal fault lines” in
group working [223]. When new relationships are formed the “primary concern is one of
uncertainty reduction or increasing predictability about the behaviour of both themselves
and others in the interaction” [224]. This concept of smoothness in the conversation is a
recurring theme, with better engineered systems introducing less extraneous artefacts into
the communication, and so disturbing the ﬂow less. Immersive metaverse are rife with
artefacts.

In a similar vein the actor-observer effect describes the mismatch between expectations
which can creep into conversation. Conversations mediated by technology can be especially
prone to diverging perceptions of the causes of behaviour [225]. Basically this means

7.5 Psychology of Technology-Mediated Interaction

128

misunderstandings happen, and are harder to resolve with more mediating technology.

Interacting subjects progress conversation through so-called ‘perception-action’ loops
which are open to predictive modelling through discrete hidden Markov models [226].
This might allow product OKR testing of the effectiveness of engineered systems [227].
It may be that the perception-behaviour link where unconscious mirroring of posture
bolsters empathy between conversational partners, especially when working collaboratively
[228], and the extent to which posture is represented through a communication medium
may be important.

Landsberger posited the Hawthorne effect [229]. Put simply this is a short term
increase in productivity that may occur as a result of being watched or appreciated. The
impression of being watched changes gaze patterns during experimentation, with even
implied observation through an eye tracker modifying behaviour [230].

There are also some fascinating ﬁndings around the neural correlates of gratitude,
which turn out not to be linked to gratitude felt by a participant, but rather the observation
of gratitude received within a social context [231]. These ﬁndings have potentially useful
implications for the behaviours of AI actors and avatars within an immersive social scene.
There is much historic work describing “the anatomy of cooperation" [232], and
this might better inform how educational or instructional tasks are built in metaverse
applications.

Cuddihy and Walters deﬁned an early model for assessing desktop interaction mecha-

nisms for social virtual environments [233].

7.5.3.1 Perception Of Honesty

Hancock et al. state that we are most likely to lie, and to be lied to, on the telephone [234].
Technology used for communication impacts interpersonal honesty. It seems that at some
level humans know this; lack of eye contact leads to feelings of deception, impacting trust
[235]. This has a major impact on immersive social XR, which often does not support
mutual gaze. Trust is crucial for business interactions.

Further there are universal expressions, micro-expressions, and blink rate which can
betray hidden emotions [236], though the effects are subtle and there is a general lack of
awareness by humans of their abilities in this regard [235]. Absence of support for such
instinctive cues inhibits trust [237]. Support for these rapid and transient facial features
demands high resolution reproduction in both resolution and time domains. There is
detectable difference in a participant’s ability to detect deception when between video
conference mediated communication and that mediated by avatars [170]. Systems should
aim for maximally faithful reproduction.

7.5.4 Presence, Co-presence, and Social Presence

Presence is a heavily cited historic indicator of engagement in virtual reality, though the
precise meaning has been interpreted differently by different specialisms [238, 239]. It is
generally agreed to be the ’sense of being’ in a virtual environment [240]. Slater extends
this to include the “extent to which the VE becomes dominant".

Beck et al. reviewed 108 articles and synthesised an ontology of presence [238] which

at its simplest is as follows:
1. Sentient presence

a. Physical interaction
b. Mental interaction

7.5 Psychology of Technology-Mediated Interaction

129

2. Non-sentient

a. Physical immersion
b. Mental immersion = psychological state

When presence is applied to interaction it may be split into Telepresence, and Co/Social
presence [241, 242]. Co-presence and/or social presence is the sense of “being there with
another", and describes the automatic responses to complex social cues [243, 244]. Social
presence (and co-presence) refers in this research context to social presence which is
mediated by technology (even extending to text based chat [245]), and has its foundations
in psychological mechanisms which engender mutualism in the ‘real’. This is analysed in
depth by Nowak [246]. An examination of telepresence, co-presence and social presence
necessarily revisits some of the knowledge already elaborated.

The boundaries between the three are blurred in research with conﬂicting results
presented [247]. Biocca et al. attempted to enumerate the different levels and interpretations
surrounding these vague words [248], and to distill them into a more robust theory which
better lends itself to measurement. They suggest a solid understanding of the surrounding
psychological requirements which need support in a mediated setting, and then a scope
that is detailed and limited to the mediated situation.

Since ‘social presence’ has been subject to varied deﬁnitions [248] it is useful here
to consider a single deﬁnition from the literature which deﬁnes it as “the ability of par-
ticipants in the community of inquiry to project their personal characteristics into the
community, thereby presenting themselves to the other participants as real people.” [249,
238]. Similarly to speciﬁcally deﬁne co-presence for this research it is taken to be the
degree to which participants in a virtual environment are “accesible, available, and subject
to one another" [248].

Social presence has received much attention and there are established questionnaires
used in the ﬁeld for measurement of the levels of perceived social presence yet the
deﬁnitions here also remain broad, with some confusion about what is being measured
[248].

Telepresence meanwhile is interaction with a different (usually remote) environment
which may or may not be virtual, and may or may not contain a separate social/co-presence
component.

Even in simple videoconferencing Bondareva and Bouwhuis stated (as part of an
experimental design) that the following determinants are important to create social presence
[250, 141].

1. Direct eye contact is preserved
2. Wide visual ﬁeld
3. Both remote participants appear life size
4. Possibility for participants to see the upper body of the interlocutor
5. High quality image and correct colour reproduction
6. Audio with high S/N ratio
7. Directional sound ﬁeld
8. Minimization of the video and audio signal asynchrony
9. Availability of a shared working space.
Bondareva et al. went on to describe a person-to-person telepresence system with a
semi-silvered mirror to reconnect eye gaze, which they claimed increased social presence
indicators. Interestingly they chose a checklist of interpersonal interactions which they
used against recordings of conversations through the system [250].

7.6 Other Systems to Support Business

130

The idea of social presence as an indicator of the efﬁcacy of the system, suggests the
use of social presence questionnaires in the evaluation of the system [248]. Subjective
questionnaires are however troublesome in measuring effectiveness of virtual agents and
embodiments, with even nonsensical questions producing seemingly valid results [251].
Usoh et al. found that ’the real’ produced only marginally higher presence results than the
virtual [252]. It would be difﬁcult to test products this way.

Nowak states that “A satisfactory level of co-presence with another mind can be
achieved with conscious awareness that the interaction is mediated" and asserts that while
the mediation may inﬂuence the degree of co-presence it is not a prohibiting factor [246].
Baren and IJsselsteijn [253, 254] list 20 useful presence questionnaires in 2004 of which
“Networked Minds" seemed most appropriate for the research. Hauber et al. employed the
“Networked Minds" Social Presence questionnaire experimentally and found that while
the measure could successfully discriminate between triadic conversation that is mediated
or unmediated by technology, it could not ﬁnd a difference between 2D and 3D mediated
interfaces [255, 245].

In summary, social presence and co-presence are important historic measures of the
efﬁcacy of a communication system. Use of the term in literature peaked between 1999
and 2006 according to Google’s ngram viewer and has been slowly falling off since.
The questionnaire methodology has been challenged in recent research and while more
objective measurement may be appropriate, the networked minds questions seem to be
able to differentiate real from virtual interactions [254].

7.6 Other Systems to Support Business

There have been many attempts to support group working and rich data sharing between
dispersed groups in a business setting. So called ’smart spaces’ allow interaction with
different displays for different activities and add in some ability to communicate with
remote or even mobile collaborators on shared documents [129], with additional challenges
for multi-disciplinary groups who are perhaps less familiar with one or more of the
technology barriers involved [130].

Early systems like clearboard [131] demonstrated the potential for smart whiteboards
with a webcam component for peer to peer collaborative working. Indeed it is possible to
support this modality with Skype and a smartboard system (and up to deployments such as
Accessgrid). They remain relatively unpopular however.

Displays need not be limited to 2 dimensional screens and can be enhanced in various

ways.

Stereoscopy allows an illusion of depth to be added to a 2D image by exploiting
the stereo depth processing characteristics of the human vision system. This technical
approach is not perfect as it does not fully recreate the convergence and focus expected by
the eyes and brain.

There are multiple approaches to separating the left and right eye images, these pri-
marily being active (where a signal selectively blanks the input to left then right eyes in
synchronicity with the display), passive, where either selective spectrum or selective polar-
isation of light allow different portions of a display access to different eyes, or physical
arrangements which present different displays (or slices of light as in lenticular systems)
to different eyes.

These barrier stereoscopy / lenticular displays use vertical light barriers built into the

7.6 Other Systems to Support Business

131

display to create multiple discrete channels of display which are accessed by moving
horizontally with respect to the display. In this way it is possible to generate either a
left/right eye image pair for ’autostereoscopic’ viewing, or with the addition of head
tracking and small motors. With these techniques multiple viewpoint or an adaptive
realtime viewpoint update can be presented without the glasses required for active or
passive stereoscopic systems.

7.6.1 Spatially Faithful Group

Hauber et al. combined videoconferencing, tabletop, and social presence analysis and
tested the addition of 3D. They found a nuanced response when comparing 2D and 3D
approaches to spatiality: 3D showed improved presence over 2D (chieﬂy through gaze
support), while 2D demonstrated improved task performance because of task focus [256].
I3DVC reconstructs participants from multiple cameras and places them isotropically
(spatially faithful) [257, 258]. The system uses a large projection screen, a custom table,
and carefully deﬁned seating positions. They discussed an “extended perception space"
which used identical equipment in the remote spaces in a tightly coupled collaborative
It employed head tracking and multi camera reconstruction alongside large
‘booth’.
screens built into the booth. This system exempliﬁed the physical restrictions which are
required to limit the problems of looking into another space through the screen. Fuchs
et al. demonstrated a similar system over a wide area network but achieved only limited
resolution and frame rate with the technology of the day [259].

University of Southern California used a technically demanding real-time set-up with
3D face scanning and an autostereoscopic 3D display to generate multiple ‘face tracked’
viewpoints [260]. This had the disadvantage of displaying a disembodied head.

MAJIC is an early comparable system to support small groups with life size spatially
correct video, but without multiple viewpoints onto the remote collaborators it was a one
to ’some’ system rather than ’some’ to one. Additionally users were rooted to deﬁned
locations [261, 262].

There seems to be less interest recently in large display screens for spatially correct
viewpoints between groups. The hardware is technically demanding and there may have
been sufﬁcient research done to limit investment in research questions. This doesn’t mean
that there is no future for metaverse applications. Imagine one of the new XR studio walls
such as that used to ﬁlm the Mandalorian. With application of telepresence research it
would be possible to bring external metaverse participants into the ‘backstage’ virtual
scene. These avatars would be able to explore the scene invisible to the actors, but could
be given access to visual feeds from the stage side. This is a hybrid virtual/real metaverse
with a well researched and understood boundary interface. It would be possible to give
different access privileges to different levels of paying ‘ﬁlm studio tourist’ or investor, with
VIPs perhaps commanding a view onto the live ﬁlming. At the nadir of this it may be
possible to bring producers and directors directly into the virtual studio as avatars on the
screen boundary, with a spatially faithful view onto the set. For the purposes of this book
it’s also worth noting that NFTs of the experience and corresponding virtual objects from
the scene could be monetised and sold within the metaverse.

7.6.1.1 Multiview

In order to reconnect directional cues of all kinds it is necessary for each party in the
group to have a spatially correct view of the remote user which is particular for them. This

7.6 Other Systems to Support Business

132

requires a multi-view display, which has applications beyond telepresence but are used
extensively in research which attempts to address these issues.

Nguyen and Canny demonstrated the ‘Multiview’ system [138]. Multiview is a spatially
segmented system, that is, it presents different views to people standing in different
locations simultaneously. They found similar task performance in trust tasks to face-to-
face meetings, while a similar approach without spatial segmentation was seen to negatively
impact performance.

In addition to spatial segmentation of viewpoints [263] it is possible to isolate view-
points in the time domain. Different tracked users can be presented with their individual
view of a virtual scene for a few milliseconds per eye, before another viewpoint is shown
to another user. Up to six such viewpoints are supported in the c1x6 system [264] Sim-
ilarly MM+Space offered 4 Degree-Of-Freedom Kinetic Display to recreate Multiparty
Conversation Spaces [265]

7.6.2 Holography and Volumetric

Blanche et al. have done a great deal of research into holographic and volumetric displays
using lasers, rotating surfaces, and light ﬁeld technology [266, 267]. They are actively
seeking to use their technologies for telepresence and their work is very interesting.

Similarly Jones et al. “HeadSPIN" is a one-to-many 3D video teleconferencing system
[260] which uses a rotating display to render the holographic head of a remote party. They
achieve transmissible and usable framerate using structured light scanning of a remote
collaborator as they view a 2D screen which they say shows a spatially correct view of the
onlooking parties.

Eldes et al. used a rotating display to present multi-view autostereoscopic projected

images to users [268].

Seelinder is an interesting system which uses parallax barriers to render a head which
an onlooking viewer can walk around. The system uses 360 high resolution still images
which means a new spatially segmented view of the head every 1 degreesof arc. They
claim the system is capable of playback of video and this head in a jar multi-view system
clearly has merit but is comparatively small, and as yet untested for telepresence [269].

These systems do not satisfy the requirement to render upper body for the viewers and

are not situated (as described soon).

There’s a future possible where real-time scanned avatar representation in persistent
shared metaverse environments will be able to support business, but the camera rigs which
currently generate such models are too bulky and involved for a good costs beneﬁt analysis.
It is more likely that recent advances in LIDAR phone scanning show the way. The allow
realistic avatars to be quickly created for animation within metaverse scenes [270].

7.6.3 Simulated Humans

7.6.3.1 Uncanniness

When employing simulation representations of humans it may be the case that there is an
element of weirdness to some of these systems, especially those that currently represent a
head without a body. Mori has demonstrated The Uncanny Valley [271] effect in which
imperfect representations of humans elicit revulsion in certain observers. This provides a
toolkit for inspecting potentially ‘weird’ representations, especially if they are ‘eerie’ and
is testable through Mori’s GODSPEED questionnaire.

7.6 Other Systems to Support Business

133

With an improved analysis of the shape of the likeability curve estimated later show-
ing a more nuanced response from respondents where anthropomorphism of characters
demonstrated increased likeability even against a human baseline [272, 273].

A mismatch in the human realism of face and voice also produces an Uncanny Valley

response [274].

However, there is a possibility that Mori’s hypothesis may be too simplistic for practical
everyday use in CG and robotics research since anthropomorphism can be ascribed to
many and interdependent features such as movement and content of interaction [273].

Bartneck et al. also performed tests which suggest that the original Uncanny Valley
assertions may be incorrect, and that it may be inappropriate to map human responses to
human simulacrum to such a simplistic scale. They suggest that the measure has been a
convenient ‘escape route’ for researchers [273]. Their suggestion that the measure should
not hold back the development of more realistic robots holds less bearing for the main
thrust of this telepresence research which seeks to capture issues with imperfect video
representation rather than test the validity of an approximation.

Interestingly Ho et al. performed tests on a variety of facial representations using
images. They found that facial performance is a ‘double edged sword’ with realism being
important to robotic representations, but there also being a signiﬁcant Uncanny Valley
effect around ‘eerie, creepy, and strange’ which can be avoided by good design [275].

More humanlike representations exhibiting higher realism produce more positive social
interactions when subjective measures are used [210] but not when objective measures are
used. This suggests that questionnaires may be more important when assessing potential
uncanniness.

A far more objective method would be to measure user responses to humans, robots,
and representations with functional near-infrared spectroscopy and while this has been
attempted it is early exploratory research [276], an emotional response to ‘eerie’ was
discovered.

7.6.3.2 Embodiment through robots

Virtuality human representation extends beyond simple displays into robotic embodiments
(which need not be humanoid [277]), shape mapped projection dubbed “shader lamps",
and hybridisations of the two.

Robots which carry a videoconference style screen showing a head can add mobility
and this extends the available cues [278, 279, 280, 281, 282]. Interestingly Desai and Uhlik
maintain that the overriding modality should be high quality audio [283].

Tsui et al. asked 96 participants to rate how personal and interactive they found
interfaces to be. Interestingly they rated videoconferencing as both more personal and
more interactive than telepresence robots, suggesting that there is a problem with the
overall representation or embodiment [284].

Kristoffersson et al. applied the Networked Minds questionnaire to judge presence
of a telepresence robot for participants with little or no experience of videoconferencing.
Their results were encouraging, though they identiﬁed that the acuity of the audio channel
needing improvement [285].

There are a very few lifelike robots which can be used for telepresence, and even
these are judged to be uncanny [286]. This is only an issue for a human likeness since
anthropomorphic proxies such as robots and toys perform well [271].

7.6 Other Systems to Support Business

134

7.6.3.3 Physical & Hybrid embodiment

Embodiment through hybridisation of real-time video and physical animatronic man-
nequins has been investigated as a way to bring the remote person into the space in a more
convincing way [287, 288, 289]. These include telepresence robots [279, 286, 280], head
in a jar implementations such as SphereAvatar [290, 291, 292] and BiReality [293], UCL’s
Gaze Preserving Situated Multi-View Telepresence System [291], or screen on a stick style
representations [282].

Nagendran et al. present a 3D continuum of these systems into which they suggest all
such systems can be rated from artiﬁcial to real on the three axes, shape, intelligence, and
appearance [294].

Itoh et al. describe a ’face robot’ to convey captured human emotion over a distance.
It uses an ‘average face’ and actuators to manipulate feature points [295]. It seems that
this is an outlier method for communication of facial affect but demonstrates that there are
many development paths to a more tangible human display.

It seems increasingly likely that machine learning models which manipulate images in
real time can simulate humans into metaverse applications with very little input data. One
such example is Samsung’s Megaportraits which can product a realistic human face from a
single input stream such as a webcam [296].

7.6.3.4 Shader lamps

Projection mapping is a computational augmented projection technique where considera-
tion of the relative positions and angles of complex surfaces allows the projection from
single or multiple sources to augment the physical shapes onto which they appear. It was
ﬁrst considered by the Disney corporation in 1969 and was given prominence by Raskar
and Fuchs with “ofﬁce of the future" [297] and later by Raskar and other researchers [289].
It has since gained considerable commercial popularity in live entertainment.

Shader lamps [289] is the more formal academic designation for projection mapping.
It is possible to use the technique alongside reconstruction to project onto a white facial
mannequin. Researchers have attempted to use the technology for remote patient diagnostic,
projecting onto styrofoam heads [298].

Bandyopadhyay et al. demonstrated [299] that it is possible to track objects and
projection map [300] onto them in real time. This is beyond the scope of the proposed
projection onto furniture since we wish to keep the system as simple as possible, but could
be useful for shared tasks in the future work.

Lincoln et al. employed animatronic avatars which they projected with shader lamps.
This combination recreated facial expression and head movement though they were limited
in speed and range of control of the remote head [288].

While shader lamps are an important and useful technology, there are limitations
imposed by its use. In particular if a realtime video feed or reconstruction of a subject is
used then that scanned subject must either remain still enough to be correctly mapped onto
geometry on the remote side (useful for some virtual patients for instance [301], or else
there must be a computational adjustment made for their changing position to make them
appear static, or the projection surface must move to match their movement as in Lincoln
et al.

7.7 Theoretical Framework toward metaverse

135

7.6.3.5 Metaverse

In supporting business it’s not clear that performance is improved or even maintained by
the use of a metaverse. Xi et al. found a signiﬁcant negative impact to productivity within
metaverse applications [302]. It lowers productivity, and may increase anxiety, nausea,
VR sickness and even migraines [303]. Ir seems at this stage that if we are determined to
explore metaverse for business then we should mitigate the problems as much as possible
using the understanding we have gained so far.

7.7 Theoretical Framework toward metaverse

7.7.1 Problem Statement

It seems that metaverse is not the most useful way to conduct business. It is furthermore
clear that there are multiple factors which contribute to successful human-human commu-
nication. These factors remain important in telecommunication supported by technology,
and are variously supported, unsupported, or modiﬁed by particular technologies.

Of particular importance is interpersonal gaze [171, 145, 172]. Non-verbal cues are also
important across multiple modalities of sight, sound [147], and position of interlocutors
[155], extending to the whole body [145, 184].

While formal meeting paradigms are pretty well supported by commercially deployed
systems, such ICT can be expensive, may need to be professionally managed, and high end
equipment in board rooms are generally booked well in advance. These meetings seem
to demand many smaller supporting meetings between parties or groups of parties. The
pressure here is clearly toward the now ubiquitous Teams and Zoom style formats, and
these offer very poor support for social cues, and incur additional fatigue.

The ‘problem’ is a supporting technology for small less formal groups, or ad-hoc
groups meeting to add clarity or context to formal meetings. Metaverse allows this
kind of interaction, while not seeming to replace formal meeting utility. Metaverse also
may connect home and work spaces without bringing in those backgrouds, creating a
level playing ﬁeld. A more advanced metaverse interface could also allow dynamism
and movement, connection of natural non vocal cues, without too much encumbering
technology overhead.

7.7.2 Core Assumptions

Figure 7.5 shows the interlocking relationships between baseline communication where
the participants are present, and technology which attempts to support across distance.

Of most interest to this research is the centre of the Venn where meeting styles which
are less formal, and perhaps dynamic, may occur. Looking at these items one by one gives
us our core assumptions.

1. Gaze

Gaze is broadly agreed to be highly important for mediating ﬂow. Mutual gaze is
a rich emotional channel. The research must consider gaze. All of the researchers
listed around the Venn have at some point engaged with this topic.

2. Attention

The non-verbal communication channel employed in ‘attention’ is assumed based
upon the literature to be critical to smoothly leaving and entering a fast ﬂowing
conversation where concentration around a deﬁned problem may be high (gesturing

7.7 Theoretical Framework toward metaverse

136

Figure 7.5: The Venn diagram shows areas of research which have been identiﬁed in blue.
These interlock and overlap as shown. The most relevant identiﬁed researchers from the
literature are shown in black close to the ﬁelds of study which they represent. This diagram
is a view of the core assumptions for the research, with the most important ﬁelds at the
centre.

to a chair for instance). Again, all of the listed researchers have made reference to
attention in their work.

3. Spatial (immersive)

Support for spatiality is important in a group setting so that directional non-verbal
cues can ﬁnd their target. The topic of spatial relationships between interlocutors
cuts across all of the researchers, but this is not true of immersion. Immersion in
a shared virtuality can certainly support the underlying requirements spatial, but
the technical infrastructure required is out of scope (so this is struck through on the
diagram). Roberts and Steed are the main expertise referenced even though this
element is not expanded in the research.

4. Situated

Situated displays are those which are appropriate for their surrounding context, in
this case the informal meeting. Roberts, Pan, Steed and Steptoe seem the most
relevant researchers in these technology spaces.

5. Informal

7.8 Post ‘Meta’ metaverse

137

Based on the literature proxemics is believed to be relevant in a meeting where
subgroups can be instantiated and destroyed as the meeting evolves, and those where
people can be invited in from outside the physical bounds of the meeting (informal
spaces). Hall is the best source for this work. If it is assumed that people may come
and go, and subgroups may be convened then Sermon and Benford are the best
references through their work blending real and virtual spaces. This may be more
consistent with less organised meetings such as those convened on demand (ad-hoc).

7.7.3 Peripheral Assumptions

Surrounding the centre of the Venn are additional relevant topics from social science
branches of theory

From verbal communication
It is assumed that the directionality of sound is important [142], and this will be
engineered into the experimental design. It is assumed that movement of the lips is an
indicator and this is tied to latency and frame rate in the vision system.

From non-verbal communication
It is assumed that eye gaze is of high importance, and that this information channel is
supported by head gaze and body torque to a high degree. It is further assumed that mutual
eye gaze is of less relevance in a multi party meeting where there is a common focus for
attention but can be signiﬁcant for turn passing. It is assumed that upper body framing and
support for transmission of micro and macro gesturing is important for signaling attention
in the broader group, and for message passing in subgroups.

Now that we have an idea what’s important for business social communication

we can look at the available software to ﬁnd a best ﬁt.

7.8 Post ‘Meta’ metaverse

The current media around “metaverse” has been seeded by Mark Zuckerberg’s rebranding
of his Facebook company to ‘Meta’, and his planned investment in the technology. Kraus
et al suggest that this seems more a marketing and communication drive than a true shift
in the company business model [304], but despite this Park and Kim identify dozens of
recent papers of metaverse research emerging from Meta labs [107].

In Stephenson’s ‘Snow Crash’ the Hero Protagonist (drolly called Hiro Protagonist)
spends much of the novel in a dystopian virtual environment called the metaverse. It is
unclear if Facebook is deliberately embracing the irony of aping such a dystopian image,
but certainly their known predisposition for corporate surveillance, alongside their attempt
at a global digital money is ringing alarm bells, as is their current plan for monetisation.
The second order hype is likely a speculative play by major companies on the future of
the internet. Grayscale investment published a report which views Metaverse as a potential
trillion dollar global industry. Such industry reports are given to hyperbole, but it seems
the technology is becoming the focus of technology investment narratives. Some notable
exerts from a 2021 report by American bank JPMorgan show how the legacy ﬁnancial
institutions see this opportunity:

• In the view of the report “The metaverse is a seamless convergence of our physical
and digital lives, creating a uniﬁed, virtual community where we can work, play,
relax, transact, and socialize.” - this isn’t the worst deﬁnition, and very much plays
into both the value and mixed reality themes explored in this book.

7.9 Market analysis

138

• They agree with the industry that monetisation of assets in metaverse applications
is called “Metanomics”. It’s worth seeing this word once, as it’s clearly gaining
traction, but it won’t be used in this book.

• They make a point which is at the core of this book, that value transaction within
metaverses may remove effective border controls for working globally. Be this
teleoperation of robots, education, or shop fronts in a completely immersive VR
world. They say: “One of the great possibilities of the metaverse is that it will
massively expand access to the marketplace for consumers from emerging and
frontier economies. The internet has already unlocked access to goods and services
that were previously out of reach. Now, workers in low-income countries, for example,
may be able to get jobs in western companies without having to emigrate.”

• There is a passage which foreshadows some of the choices made in this book: “Ex-
panded data analytics and reporting for virtual spaces. These will be speciﬁcally
designated for commercial and marketing usage and will track business key perfor-
mance indicators (this already exists in some worlds, such as Cryptovoxels)”. More
on this later.

• The report attempts to explore the web3 & cryptocurrency angles of metaverse.
That’s also the aim of this book, but they have taken a much more constrained
approach, ignoring the possibilities within Bitcoin.

• They assert that strong regulatory capture, identiﬁcation, KYC/AML etc should
underpin their vision of the metaverse. This is far from the community driven and
organically emergent narratives that underpin Web3. This is their corporate view-
point, something they have to say. On the back of this they pitch their consultancy
services in these areas.

There has been a reactive pushback against commercialisation and corporateisation by
the wider tech community, who are concerned about the aforementioned monetisation of
biometrics. Observers do not trust these ‘Web2’ players with such a potentially powerful
social medium. It is very plausible that this is all just a marketing play that goes nowhere
and ﬁzzles out. It is by no means clear that people want to spend time socialising globally
in virtual and mixed reality. These major companies are making an asymmetric bet that if
there is a move into virtual worlds, then they need to be stakeholders in the gatekeeping
capabilities of those worlds.

7.9 Market analysis

The Drum is a market awareness website and compiled the following statistics, which have
been linked back to their source and annotated for our needs.

• 89.4 million Americans are expected to use virtual reality (VR) in 2022, according
to insiderintelligence. That number, according to the same source, is expected to
climb to 110.3 million in 2025. As a counter to this only around 16M VR headsets
were sold in 2022

• 51% of gen Z and 48% of millennials envision doing some of their work in the
metaverse in the next two years, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index 2022.
• 38% of respondents said they would “try extreme sports like skydiving, bungee jump-
ing, or paragliding” in the metaverse according to a recent Statista survey called
‘What things would you do in the metaverse but never in real life?’ Unsettlingly, 18%
of respondents said they would “conduct unethical experiments on virtual humans”

7.9 Market analysis

139

• 87% of Americans between the ages of 13-56 would be interested in engaging with
a virtual experience in the metaverse “that is built around a celebrity they love,”
according to new research from UTA and Vox Media

• $678bn is forecasted to be the total market valuation of the metaverse by 2030, per
Grand View Research. According to the report, that market value was just shy of
• $39bn in 2021, giving it a predicted compounded annual growth rate over a 10-year

period of around 39

• 46% of all people across age groups say that the ability to visualize a virtual product
in an IRL context – “such as seeing a digital painting in their home using augmented
reality (AR) glasses” – is the primary factor that would motivate them to make a
purchase in the metaverse, per a Productsup survey

• 24% of US adult internet users say “that lower-priced VR headsets were a very
important factor when deciding whether to try using the metaverse,” per a recent
Statista survey. On the other hand, 54% say that their workplace using the metaverse
would “not [be] important at all” in their decision to give the metaverse a try
• 15% of gen Zs’ “fun budget” is spent in the metaverse, per a report from Razorﬁsh
and Vice Media Group. In ﬁve years that number is projected to climb to 20%
• Nearly 77% believe that the metaverse “can cause serious harm to modern society,”
per a recent survey from customer service platform Tidio. The survey, which received
feedback from 1,000 participants, identiﬁed three major causes of anxiety related to
the metaverse and its potentially negative social impacts: “addiction to a simulated
reality” was the number one concern, followed by “privacy issues” and “mental
health issues,” which were tied for second

• By 2026, about 2 billion people worldwide “will spend at least one hour a day in the
metaverse to work, shop, attend school, socialize or consume entertainment,” per
McCann Worldgroup. By that same year, the total value of the virtual goods market
in the metaverse could be as high as $200bn

• NFTs Over $37bn has been spent in NFT marketplaces as of May 2022, per data
from Chainalysis. At their current rate, this year’s NFT sales could potentially
surpass last year’s, which had a total valuation of around $40bn, according to the
data

• $91.8m was the sale price of ‘The Merge,’ the most valuable NFT to date. Created

by the artist Pak, it sold for its record-breaking value in December 2021

• 64% of sports fans are open to the idea of learning more about NFTs and would
consider purchasing one in the future, according to the National Research Group.
The report also found that 46% of sports fans “would be more likely to attend live
sporting events if they were rewarded with a commemorative NFT – for example, if
their ticket turned into a digital collectible after the game”

• Only 9% of people aged 16-44 own a NFT, and less than half (44%) have purchased
or invested in crypto, per a new survey from agency SCS. On the other hand, among
the survey’s 600 respondents, 64% were “aware” of the metaverse, and 65% of
that subgroup say they are “interested in exploring it further for everything from
traveling to new places and playing games to making money and shopping”

Polling company IPSOS have conducted a global survey for the World Economic

Forum. Some highlights are:

• “Excitement about extended reality is signiﬁcantly higher in emerging countries
than it is in most high-income countries. In China, India, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and

7.10 NFT and crypto as metaverse

140

Colombia, more than two-thirds say they have positive feelings about the possibility
of engaging with it.”

• “Familiarity and favorability toward the new technologies are also signiﬁcantly
higher among younger adults, those with a higher level of education, and men than
they are among older adults, those without a college-level education, and women.”
Excitingly for our exploration of the topic it can be seen in Figure 7.6 that education
within metaverse spaces is the most anticipated application, and we have seen that the
emerging globals markets are the most optimistic about the technology overall. This is
highly suggestive of an opportunity.

Figure 7.6: IPSOS poll predicted applications

7.10 NFT and crypto as metaverse

Within the NFT, Web3 and crypto community it is normalised to refer to ownership of
digital tokens as participation in a metaverse. This is reﬂected in the market analysis
above. This fusing of narratives is reviewed in detail by Gadekallu et al in their excellent
recent paper on Metaverse and Blockchain [305]. They conclude that much remains to be
done here. This CNBC article highlights the confusion, as this major news outlet refers to
Walmart prepares to offer NFTs” as an entry “into the metaverse”.

7.11 Immersive and third person XR

In considering the needs of business to business and business to client social VR is it
useful to compare software platforms. We have seen that a global connected multiverse is
a marketing proposition only, and may be a decade or more away. Contenders currently
look more like one of three catagories; games, limited massively multiplayer worlds, or
meeting support software. These will converge.

7.11.1 More like a digital twin

One of the most intuitive ways to view a metaverse is as a virtual landscape. This is how
metaverse was portrayed in the original Neal Stephenson use of the word. ‘Digital twin’ is
another much abused industry term which trends toward a 3D representation of real world
spaces and objects. Sometimes these virtual objects are connected to the real by telemetry,
allowing industrial monitoring applications. Much is made of such systems in simulation
brochures, and on the web, but it’s surprisingly hard to ﬁnd real world applications of
the idea outside of complex large scale systems engineering (aerospace). The costs of
maintenance are simply too high. The US army owns the digital twin which could be called
closest to “The Metaverse” (note the intentional capitalisation). Their global simulation
environment mirrors real world locations for their training needs.

7.11.1.1 Geolocated AR

Overlaying geospeciﬁc data into augmented reality (think Pokemon Go) is probably the
ultimate utility of digital twin datasets. It’s such a compelling application space that we
will have more on this later.

7.11.2 More like a metaverse

7.11.2.1 Second Life

Notable because it’s the original and has a decently mature marketplace. Some $80M was
paid to creators in Second Life in 2021 in a wider economic ecosystem of around $650M.
It’s possible to write a whole book on Second life, and indeed many have. It’s longevity
means that there’s more study of business uses of such systems than in any other platform.

7.11.2.2 Mozilla Hubs

Hubs is a great option for this proposal, and might be worth integrating later. It runs well
in a browser and on VR hardware.

• Open source, bigger scale, more complex
• Choose avatars, or import your own
• Environments are provided, or can be designed
• Useful for larger conferences with hundreds or thousands of members but is com-

mensurately more complex

• Quest and PC
• Larger scenes within scenes

7.11.2.3 Counter social realms

A relatively new platform linked to a new model of social media which excludes countries
which habitually spam. It uses Mozilla Hubs for it’s engine.

7.11.2.4 Roblox

If anything can currently claim to be the metaverse it’s probably Roblox. Around 60 billion
messages are sent daily in Roblox. Investment in the metaverse ‘angle’ of the platform is
stepping up with recent announcements such as “Spotify Island”. It’s very notable that it
still hasn’t become a proﬁtable business. It is important to note that Roblox has banned
NFTs. Nike have garnered signiﬁcant attention for their metaverse store, front with their
Roblox based metaverse. As Theo Priestley points out this is likely just another expensive
experiment, with a ﬁnite lifespan.

Minecraft has also banned NFTs

7.11.2.6 Surreal

7.11.2.7 Sansar

7.11.2.8 Cornerstone

7.11.2.9 AltSpace

• Microsoft social meeting platform
• Very good custom avatar design
• Great world building editor in the engine
• Doesn’t really support business integration so it’s a bit out of scope
• Huge numbers (many thousands) possible so it’s great for global events
• Mac support

7.11.2.10 VRChat

This text is from wikipedia and will be updated when we have a chance to try VRChat
properly. It’s much loved already by the Bitcoin community.

“VRChat’s gameplay is similar to that of games such as Second Life and Habbo Hotel.
Players can create their own instanced worlds in which they can interact with each other
through virtual avatars. A software development kit for Unity released alongside the game
gives players the ability to create or import character models to be used in the platform, as
well as build their own worlds.

Player models are capable of supporting "audio lip sync, eye tracking and blinking,

and complete range of motion.

VRChat is also capable of running in "desktop mode" without a VR headset, which is
controlled using either a mouse and keyboard, or a gamepad. Some content has limitations
in desktop mode, such as the inability to freely move an avatar’s limbs, or perform
interactions that require more than one hand.

In 2020, a new visual programming language was introduced known as "Udon", which
uses a node graph system. While still considered alpha software, it became usable on
publicly-accessible worlds beginning in April 2020. A third-party compiler known as
"UdonSharp" was developed to allow world scripts to be written in C sharp.”

7.11.2.11 Meta Horizon Worlds & Workrooms

Horizon Worlds is the Meta (Facebook) meteverse, and Workrooms it’s business offering
and a subset of the “Worlds” global system. It is currently a walled garden without
connection to the outside digital world, and arguably not therefore a metaverse.

The Financial Times took a look at their patent applications and noted that the travel is

toward increased user behaviour tracking, and targeted advertising.

Facebook actually have a poor history on innovation and diversiﬁcation of their business
model. This model has previously been tracking users to target ads on their platform, while
increasing and maintaining attention using machine learning algorithms.

It makes complete sense then to analyse the move by Meta into 3D social spaces as
an attempt to front run the technology using their huge investment capacity. Facebook
have recently taken a huge hit to their share price. Nothing seems to have changed in
the underling business except Zuckerberg’s well publicised shift to supporting a money
losing gamble on the Metaverse. It is by no means clear that users want this, that Meta will

7.11 Immersive and third person XR

143

be able to better target ads on this new platform, or that the markets are willing to trust
Zuckerburg on this proactive move.

With all this said the investment and management capacity and capability at Meta
cannot be dismissed. It is very likely that Meta will be able to rapidly deploy a 3D social
space, and that it’s development will continue to be strong for years. The main interface
for Horizon Worlds is through the Meta owned and developer Oculus headset, which is
excellent and reasonably affordable. It has been quite poorly received by reviewers but
will likely improve, especially if users are encouraged to innovate.

7.11.2.12 Webaverse

Webaverse are an open collective using open source tools to create interoperable meta-
verses.

7.11.2.13 Vircadia

The applications and platforms detailed above have their beneﬁts, but for the application
stack in the next section of the book Vircadia has been chosen. The following text is from
their website, and is a placeholder which gives some idea. This section will be written out
completely to reﬂect our use of the product.

Vircadia is open-source software which enables you to create and share virtual worlds
as virtual reality (VR) and desktop experiences. You can create and host your own virtual
world, explore other worlds, meet and connect with other users, attend or host live VR
events, and much more.

The Vircadia metaverse provides built-in social features, including avatar interactions,
spatialized audio, and interactive physics. Additionally, you have the ability to import any
3D object into your virtual environment. No matter where you go in Vircadia, you will
always be able to interact with your environment, engage with your friends, and listen to
conversations just like you would in real life.

What can I do? You have the power to shape your VR experience in Vircadia.
• EXPLORE by hopping between domains in the metaverse, attend events, and check

out what others are up to!

• CREATE personal experiences by building avatars, domains, tablet apps, and more

for you and others to enjoy.

• SCRIPT and express your creativity by applying advanced scripting concepts to

entities and avatars in the metaverse.

• HOST and make immersive experiences to educate, entertain, and connect with your

audience.

• CONTRIBUTE to the project’s endeavor.
• DEVELOP the project and tailor it to your needs, or just to help out.
• SECURITY information about the project and its components.

7.11.3 More like crypto NFT virtual land

This next three are a placeholder taking text from the linked site and will be swapped out:
The digital land narrative is fading.

7.11.3.1 Decentraland

Decentraland is the ﬁrst-ever blockchain-powered place in the metaverse. It is a virtual
reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, experience,

7.11 Immersive and third person XR

144

and monetize content and applications.

7.11.3.2 Sandbox

The Sandbox is a virtual Metaverse where players can play, build, own, and monetize their
virtual experiences. The Sandbox blockchain gaming platform consists of three integrated
products that together provide a comprehensive experience for user-generated content.

7.11.3.3 Space Somnium

Somnium Space is a metaverse with a different objective. It allows users to join in either
through a downloadable VR client or a browser-based version to function like any other
web app.

7.11.4 More like industrial application

As the word metaverse has gained in use, so have some traditional users and researchers
in mixed reality switched to use of the term. Siyaev and Jo describe an aircraft training
metaverse which incorporates ML based speech recognition [306]. This class of mixed
reality trainer traditionally ﬁnds positive results, but is highly task speciﬁc.

7.11.4.1 Global enterprise perspective

Microsoft have just bought Activision / Blizzard for around seventy billion dollars. This
has been communicated by Microsoft executives as a “Metaverse play”, leveraging their
internal game item markets, and their massive multiplayer game worlds to build toward
a closed metaverse experience like the one Meta is planning. This builds on the success
of early experiments like the Fornite based music concerts, which attracted millions of
concurrent users to live events.

There are three emerging focuses, the social metaverses for pleasure, and business
metaverses for larger group meetings and training [307, 308], and a Nvidia’s evolving
collaborative creation metaverse for digital engineers and creatives. They’re all pretty
different ‘classes’ of problem. The social metaverse angle where Facebook is concentrating
most effort is of less interest to us here, though obviously markets will exist in such systems
for business to customer. The next section will explore some of the software tools available
to connect people. Everything looks pretty basic right now in all the available systems, but
that will likely change over the next couple of years.

7.11.5 More like meeting support

7.11.5.1 Spatial

Spatial is worth a quick look because it’s a business ﬁrst meeting tool, and comparatively
well received by industry for that purpose.
• Very compelling. Wins at wow.
• Great avatars, user generated
• AR ﬁrst design
• Limited scenes
• Smaller groups (12?)
• Limited headset support
• Intuitive meeting support tools
• No back end integration

7.11 Immersive and third person XR

7.11.5.2 MeetinVR

• Good enough graphics, pretty mature system
• OK indicative avatars, user selected
• VR ﬁrst design
• Limited scenes
• Smaller groups (12?)
• Quest and PC
• Writing and gestures supported
• Some basic enterprise tools integration
• Bring in 3D objects
• Need to apply for a license?

7.11.5.3 Glue

• Better enterprise security integration
• Larger environments, potential for breakouts in the same space. Workshop capable
• 3D object support, screen sharing, some collaborative tools
• Apply for a license
• Fairly basic graphics
• Basic avatars
• Quest and PC
• Writing and gestures supported
• Mac support

7.11.5.4 FramesVR

• Really simple to join
• Basic avatars
• Bit buggy
• 3D object support, screen sharing, some collaborative tools
• Quest and PC
• Larger scenes within scenes
• Runs in the browser

7.11.5.5 Engage

• Great polished graphics
• Fully customisable avatars
• Limited scenes
• Presentation to groups for education and learning
• PC ﬁrst, quest is side loadable but that’s a technical issue
• BigScreen VR
• Seated in observation points in a deﬁned shared theatre
• Screen sharing virtual communal screen watching, aimed at gamers, ﬁlm watching
• up to 12 user

7.11.5.6 Gather

Gather is an oddball meeting space based around fully customisable 2D rooms with a game
feel. It’s really a spatialised twist on video conferencing but interesting.

7.12 Unreal & Virtual Production

Matthew Ball is an expert on Metaverse. He explained his vision and concerns with regard
to metaverse in an adaptation of his book[309] featured on Time Magazine (Figure 7.7).
He talks about Epic’s Unreal engine and identiﬁes what he calls the Epic Flywheel for

games manufacture seen in Figure 7.8.

Epic is a behemoth and has made better business development decisions, and have a
better technology than their main competitor Unity3D. Unity didn’t make the cut for this
book, though their technology is great. Their recent merger with a malware manufacturer
and a history of poor data privacy have removed them from consideration at this time.

7.12.1 Virtual Production

7.13 Different modalities

7.13.1 Mixed reality as a metaverse

Spatial anchors allow digital objects to be overlaid persistently in the real world. With
a global ‘shared truth’ of such objects a different kind of metaverse can arise. One such
example is the forthcoming AVVYLAND.

7.13.2 Augmented reality

Marc Petit, general manager of Epic Games envisages a 2 watt pair of glasses, connected
to a 10 watt phone, connected to a 100 watt computer on the edge. This is a device cascade
problem which has not yet been solved, and is at the edge of achievable thermodynamics
and latency.

The closest technology at this time seems to be Lumus’ waveguide projectors which

are light, bright and high resolution.

7.13.3 Ubiquitous displays

This includes laser retinal displays, and smart screens which are context and user aware.

7.14 Risks

Metaverse is fraught with risks, partly because it’s new, and partly because of the pace
of adoption. Regulation is well behind the technology, to the alarm of some academic
observers [310].

• Abuse; because of the real-time and spatio-temporal abuse happens less like in the
current web 2 social media, and more like in the real world, but with less opportunity
for repercussions. It might be that natural language processing and machine learning
can help with this, but it’s a tough problem. One idea might be to record the speech to
text of interactions between participants, and ﬂag to them if a “bullying, harassment,
predation threshold” is met. This could be encrypted with the public keys of the

7.14 Risks

participants and a notice sent to them that if they wished to follow up with authorities
then they have the necessary attestations and proofs. This is minimally invasive and
privacy preserving, and acts as a strong disincentive to repeat offence. It can also
feed into a global “web of trust” reputation system in a ‘zero knowledge’ way. Users
who ﬂag abuse to the reputation system can leverage the machine learning opinion
without revealing what happened (though they would have the data). This would
also act as a disincentive without the social stigma issues of reporting.
Reporting could be achieved without machine learning identiﬁcation of potential
problems, but there would have to be a social cost to reporting (like gossiping
incessantly about others) which would erode the social score of the reporting entity.
This would mitigate bot based reputation harm.

• Miscommunication; which as we have seen in the early section of the metaverse

chapter is both complex and hard to mitigate

• Lost information
• Distraction
• Jitter, judder, jagginess, and interruption of ﬂow; because the network overhead is
higher than other communication media it’s much more exposed to latency effects

• Physical harms, especially to developing brains and ocular systems

8. AI and ML features

8.1 Augmented intelligence and ML

8.1.1 Novel VP render pipeline

Putting the ML image generation on the end of a real-time tracked camera render pipeline
might remove the need for detail in set building. To describe how this might work, the set
designer, DP, director, etc will be able to ideate in a headset based metaverse of the set
design, dropping very basic chairs, windows, light sources whatever. There is -no need-
then to create a scene in detail. If the interframe consistency (img2img) can deliver then
the output on the VP screen can simply inherit the artistic style from the text prompts,
and render production quality from the basic building blocks. Everyone in the set (or just
DP/director) could then switch in headset to the ﬁnal output and ideate (verbally) to create
the look and feel (lens, bokeh, light, artistic style etc). This isn’t ready yet as the frames
need to generate much faster (100x), but it’s very likely coming in months not years. This
“next level pre-vis” is being trailed in the Vircadia collaborative environment described in
this book.

This can be done now through the use of camera robots. A scene can be built in basic
outline, the camera tracks can be encoded into the robot, and the scene can be rapidly post
rendered by Stability with high inter frame consistency.

This chapter identiﬁes an intersectional space across the described technologies, and
proposes a valuable and novel software stack, which can enable exploration and product
development. It is useful to brieﬂy look at some of the potential applications which might
beneﬁt from value and trust exchange within an global shared social space.

9.1 Summary TL;DR

The points below are the tl;dr for the whole book. They do not currently correspond
to the order in the book, but will do at some point. Work in progress.

• There may be an inﬂection point in the organisational topology of the internet
because of trust abuses by the incumbent providers. This is calling itself Web3,
but the moniker is fraught with problems and somewhat meaningless. The
drivers are real.

• ‘The Metaverse’ is coming, in some form, at some point. Everyone is position-

ing in case it’s “soon”.

• It’s not at all clear what it is, or if people want it, but the best emergent nar-
rative seems to be “digital society” and that obviously should not be dismissed
lightly.

• From a business perspective metaverse is the worst of the remote collaboration

tool-kits, and undermines ﬂow, productivity, and interpersonal trust.

• Metaverse is probably technology for technologies sake at this time, but it’s a
strong attempt, and the investment is real. Digital society is more tangible but
less hyped.

• Excluding Facebook/Meta a lot of the investment is coming from the recent
Web3 speculative bubble, who has a parallel and intersectional metaverse nar-
rative.

• Industry has noted the risk, and failures of Meta in this domain, and have

latched onto "open metaverse" as a narrative, to de-risk their interest.

• The current open metaverse is muddy and confused.
• Anything from a multi-million pound XR studio screen, to a speech audio sys-
tem, can be a metaverse interface. AI is further blurring these boundaries.

9.1 Summary TL;DR

152

• Trust, accessibility, governance, and safeguarding, are hard problems, and

made more complex by unrecorded social ﬂow in immersive social VR.

• Industry seem to be missing the point; that open metaverse should mean open
source metaverse. There are some options, but they are under developed. This
is an opportunity.

• There’s a bunch of start-ups and options, interesting research, and some adop-
tion, but scaling is very hard in the face of tepid consumer interest. We need
to be driven by use cases.

• There is genuine, undeniable interest in digital scarcity. The ownership of dig-
ital goods seems natural to younger, digitally native users. This is serviced
already by various (gaming) platforms, but they are all isolated ecosystems.
• Uniting these attempts, with portable (transferable) “goods” across digital so-
ciety likely requires a global digital ledger (blockchain), indeed this is the basis
of the competing Web3 interpretation. Crypto is igniting imagination on this
topic, and is seeing adoption both inside out outside of the metaverse contexts.
• Crypto is a nightmare; rife with scams, poor technology choices, limited life,
and incorrect assumptions. The only thing blockchain/crypto can do well is
“money like networks”, which is a cornerstone of human interaction, and the
killer application.

• Representations of dollars and pounds etc money can ride securely on top of
such networks as stablecoins, and this is getting easier to integrate, though
there are risks.

• It’s unclear which technology will win, if any, but since the tools exist now they

can be integrated now.

• Legislative and cultural headwinds are signiﬁcant. There might be no oppor-
tunity here in the end, though “rough game theory” supports the attempt.
• Money, identity, and thereby trust, can already be mediated by the Bitcoin

network, even without using Bitcoin the asset. This is an opportunity.

• Digital ownership is nearly possible at scale, low cost, and minimal environ-

mental impact, with the Bitcoin network. This is an opportunity.

• A topologically ﬂat, inclusive, permissionless, open metaverse, with econom-
ically empowered ML and AI actors, which can mediate governance issues,
transparently, according to well constructed custom schemas, between crypto-
graphically veriﬁable economic users (human or AI) is an opportunity.

• New open source machine learning tooling potentially removes many of the
problems with accessibility, creativity, language barriers, safeguarding, and
governance. This is a huge opportunity.

• Using new image generation ML it may be possible to build a new kind of
collaborative global teams for virtual production, ideating in simplistic immer-
sive spaces while instantly creating demonstrable in camera scenes which can
be stylised using verbal commands in real-time.

• Such teams would could be far more ad-hoc by leveraging the designs outlines

in this book.

9.3 Virtual production & telepresence

Designing open federated metaverse from a 25 year research foundation There are serious
and under discussed natural social constraints on group behaviours, and these translate
into social VR. For instance the ideal meeting size is 6, and this is naturally established
in work settings. This has not translated into a metaverse setting where dozens of people
routinely crash across one another. In the context of supporting a creative “backstage”
world where set planning, production shots, etc can be discussed we believe we have
solutions which will get the best out of distributed teams of ﬁlm-makers. Leveraging
the world’s most powerful decentralised computing network to create scale and security
without high cost The Bitcoin network is more than just a speculative money like asset,
it is the most secure distributed computing system ever built. We can jump on the back
of this at almost no cost to enable scale for transfer of value, trust, and digital assets of
provenance. Cryptographically assured end points With the cryptography tools provided
through integration of the Bitcoin network we can also use non-blockchain based secure

messaging, and identity proofs. Micro transactions in collaborative spaces New tooling
the space allows fractions of a pound or dollar to be exchanged between parties across
the world. This means that work can be paid “by the second” both inside and outside
of the metaverse. This radically improves creative microtask workﬂows. World leading
open source machine learning and bot architectures By integrating Stablity AI tools for
image generation, video processing, natural language, and speech to text / text to speech
we hope to reduce friction within the backstage worlds. Creating a narrative arrow from a
remote director/producer/DP, through a VP screen into a shoot, and back into a persistent
metaverse shared with the public By linking across these new systems with world class
telepresence research we hope to use a single digital context to support senior stakeholders,
creatives, technical teams, and the wider public. New paths to monetisation and digital
ownership This uniﬁed digital back end is optimised for ﬂows of money, trust, and digital
objects. This is a new area for VP. Current workstreams:

• Storyboarding with text2img and dreambooth to add talent and costume ideas before

meeting up, as demonstrated in this document [311].

• Collaborative, self hosted, high speed, low detail, economically and cryptograph-
ically enabled set design spaces, with near instant language translation (speech to
text an speech to speech). Micropayment for cheap international labour. Technology

allowing high value stakeholders to be ‘present‘ on set as virtual collaborants with
spatial descrimination allowing directional queues. This involved real time human
capture like moveAI or the expensive rigs with DSLRs.

starting to see from the video projects [315].

• Text to model pipeline for interactively building key elements with senior stakehold-
ers, pushed from post ideation the the pre-shoot Unreal content creation [316].
• All assets switch over to Unreal metaverse and become consistent (optimised) digital
set which can be visited by stakeholders, funders, VIPs etc. Public can visit later for
a fee? Digital assets can be bought from the set.

9.4.1 ML actors and blockchain based bots

Stablity AI is an open source imitative to bring ML/AL capabilities to the world. This is a
hugely exciting emergent area and much more will be developed here.

9.4.2 AI economic actors in mixed reality

AI actors can now be trusted visually [317]. We have some thinking on this which
links the external web to our proposed metaverse using tooling developed by Melvin
Carvelho. He is working on economically empowered bots which leverage Nostr and
RGB to perform functions within our metaverse, and outside in the WWW, as well as
interacting economically through trusted cryptography with other bots, anywhere, and
human participants, anywhere. This is incredibly powerful and is assured by the Bitcoin
security model. Imagine being able to interact with a bot ﬂower seller representing all
the real world ﬂorists it had found. In the metaverse you could handle the ﬂowers and
take advice and guidance from the bot agent, then it would be able to take your money
to buy you ﬂowers to send to a real world address, and later ﬁnd you to tell you when
it’s delivered. These possibilities are endless. The AI chat element, the AI translation of
images on websites to 3D assets in the Metaverse are difﬁcult but possible challenges, but
the secure movement of money from the local context in the metaverse to the real world is
within reach using these bots, and they are completely autonomous and distributed.

9.5 Our socialisation best practice

9.5.0.1 Identity

We will base our identity and object management on Nostr public/private key pairs. The
public key of these will generate LNBits economic wallets which will interact with RGB
and Lightning globally.

9.5.0.2 Webs of trust

Webs of trust will be built within worlds using economically costly (but private) social
rating systems, between any actor, human or AI. It should be too costly to attack an
individual aggressively. This implies an increased weighting for scores issued in short time
periods. Poorly behaving AI’s will eventually be excluded through lack of funds.

9.6 Security evaluation

9.5.0.3 Integration of ’good’ actor AI entities

Gratitude practice should be encouraged between AI actors to foster trust and wellbeing
in human observers. “It’s nice to be nice” should be incentivised between all parties”.
This could include tipping and trust nudging through the social rating system. Great AI
behaviour would result in economically powerful entities.

9.5.1 Emulation of important social cues

Classroom layout

9.5.1.1 Behaviour incentives, arbitration, and penalties

Collapses of trust and abuse will trigger ﬂags from ML based oversight, which will create
situational records and payloads of involved parties to unlock with their nostr private keys.
ML red ﬂagged actors will be ﬁnacially penalised but have access to human arbitration
using their copy of the data blob. Nothing will be stored except by the end users.

9.5.2 Federations of webs of trust and economics

Web2/3 enabled ‘Bitbots’ by Melvin Carvalho, with their own money supply, should
be able to carry data payloads between virtual worlds across all networks. This is an
RGB/Nostr/Melbot problem space and requires more investigation.

9.6 Security evaluation

As part of developing our stack we will penetration test the deployment as detailed using
Hexway

• Art / NFT galleries with instant sales
This application allows artists and content creator communities to display and sell NFT

and fungible art to global consumer audiences, instantly.

• Large scale conference center

In a hypothetical virtual conference centre a true marketplace of ideas could be enacted,
with participants being paid directly by their audience based on the proximity to the
presentation.

9.7.1 Global cybersec course delivery

Isolating and building out one example here:

• Elements for the infrastructure: Economic layer, asset layer, content interface, user
management, data storage, microsites loaded in Wolvin and webm, accessibility
schema, network security, backups, secure messaging. Deployable framework
with high modularity. Some more ossiﬁed elements for surity, some less so for
malleability and open opportunity. Figure 9.4.

• Course delivery in XR, how to we develop a platform, marketplace, framework for

open contribution.

• WebXR, Vircadia, any snap in metaverse middleware that is free and open source

(action to compare the two).

• Deﬁne an interface schema for bolting in any commercial or FOSS metaverse engine.
• VR marketplace (outside the scope of the VR engine) without a trusted third party.
• Cryptographically managed learning deliverables (coursework as NFT).
• Secure messaging and group messaging using cryptographic keys. Check this stuff

with the distributed computing science people in the group (action on John)

• work toward an exemplar MVP which is then "in the wild"
• Platform for educators
• Deﬁne scheme, documentation, best practice, interfaces, functional objects, peda-

gogy, accessibility, multi-language.

• Deﬁne user management system for educators and client learners.
• Identify the pain points which current FOSS elements which need development

• separate the UI/engine from the graphical assets, and the educational / pedagogical

components, accessibility, and the value and asset transfer layers.

• Desktop systems are the primary target (low end system)
• deﬁne schema for accessibility. Colour, subtitles, immersion concerns which can be

applied to metaverse rooms through API?

• Start to deﬁne the hybrid presentation model we favour. Avatars? Micro sites? A
combination of the two? Balance of guided vs unguided experience. Do we need to
test the correct way to do delivery? Is there prior art we can draw on? I feel I should
know. Is this part of the research that’s being done here?

• Big work package on schema vs key and user management to enforce rules in spaces.
Only participants who have provably paid should have access to learning material,
the ability to input into the assessment system, and the tokenised learning outcome
‘NFT’ or proof.

• Proof that XR system improve learning outcomes. Also that the proposed systems
for micro-transactions and user and schema management give additional headroom
for teaching.

Notes on build-out The world database in the shared rooms in the metaverse is the
global object master, educational materials, videos, audio content and branded objects are
fungible tokens authentically proved by rgb client side validation between parties, only
validated ones will be persisted in shared rooms like conferences and classes according
to the room schema. That allows educators to monetise their content. That can work on
lightning. NFT objects between parties like content crafted by participants (coursework,
homework) are not on lightning and will attract main chain fees but are rarer. User
authentication and communication will be through nostr.

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

9.8.1 Overview

This how-to document details the process of creating the system detailed in the accompa-
nying book. It is intended to be complete. It is a how to guide.

9.8.1.1 Summary of software

Summarise the software and functionality

9.8.2 Prerequisites

Ensure that the BIOS / ﬁrmware / etc of the hardware you intend to use is up to date.

9.8.3 Network details

In the example setup provided here there are currently two networks:
1. The virtual server resides in a LAN with the following details:
192.168.x.0/24
Replace x with an integer between 0 and 254
This LAN has a gateway to the Internet and DNS server conﬁgured. Of course, it could
be replaced with a direct connection to the Internet, though for research and development
purposes it is often better to work within a clean LAN and manage access to the Internet
as required.

2. There is a virtual network conﬁgured on the virtual machine host upon which virtual

machines can reside:

This virtual network is not conﬁgured to bridge with the physical network adapter
rather a virtual machine is conﬁgured as a gateway to route IP trafﬁc through. This provides
a level of isolation. More on this later (@todo).

9.8.4 Server conﬁguration

9.8.4.1 Server hardware details

@todo

9.8.4.2 Disk conﬁguration details

@todo

9.8.5 Proxmox VE

9.8.5.1 Installation and conﬁguration

Version used: 7.1

Keep in mind that this setup uses the Proxmox VE installer (https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-

ve/get-started) which, as noted on the site, is a bare-metal installer and will erase all data
on at least one disk. There are alternative methods to install Proxmox VE but these are not
covered here.

A brief summary of the steps taken using Proxmox VE 7.1:
Dialogue 1 Choose the target harddisk (/dev/sda in this case).
Dialogue 2 Select country, time zone, keyboard layout.

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

162

Dialogue 3 Set a password (this is the root password, see proxmox hardening section),
and email address.
Dialogue 4 Select a Network Interface Card (NIC) on which the management interface
will be available and provide a hostname, IP address, gateway and DNS server.

In this example the following settings were used:
Hostname: proxmoximus.local IP address: 192.168.x.220 / 24 Gateway: 192.168.x.254

DNS server: 192.168.x.254

Either replace x with the integer used earlier and update the last octet of the gateway
and server with that that corresponds to your setup (assuming the setup is local and has a
local dns server or forwarder) or conﬁgure the values according to your intended setup.

Once the install has completed and the system has rebooted it is time to begin conﬁgur-
ing. This is done (almost entirely) via the web interface, in this case, available at https://
proxmoximus | 192.168.x.220 : 8006

It is also possible to login to a shell via the local terminal and SSH (which is enabled

by default @todo: in hardening, add keys and remove ability to login with password).

9.8.5.2 Software updates

If you are in a testing and non-production environment then it is possible access updates
without a subscription as detailed here: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_Repositories.
Update /etc/apt/sources.list as detailed under the Proxmox VE No-Subscription
Repository. This can be achieved via the local terminal, SSH or web interface (via Shell
option).

For example, edit the ﬁle:
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Add the following:

# PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription

To the existing:

deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib

deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org bullseye-security main contrib

Resulting in:

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib

# PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

The Proxmox VE system will now retrieve updates for both itself and the base Debian

system.

Then from a shell run:

$ apt update
$ apt upgrade

@todo: determine if system needs a reboot

Adding users
Add SSH keys and remove ability to login with password

9.8.6 Setup an internal only network in Proxmox VE

From the Web GUI navigate to Datacenter - > your server -> Network

From the menu select Create then Linux Bridge
Input the desired IPv4/CIDR in this case 192.168.y.0/24 and add a comment if desired
(“Internal network” was used here). Note that y must not be the same as x previously used.

9.8.7 Install and conﬁgure Internet gateway server virtual machine

VyOS was selected (https://vyos.io/)

9.8.7.1 Create an ISO of the stable version (as of writing 1.3.0)

@todo: the built version seemed to be a nightly release, is it possible to add a tag to get a
stable build?

Follow the build instructions:
https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/build-vyos.html
This document does not list this version (goes up to 10 “buster”) but Debian 11

“bullseye” was successfully used in this setup.

Run the following commands:

$ apt install git
$ apt install build-essential

Follow the instructions here https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/ to install

Docker

Run the following commands:

$ git clone -b equuleus --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

$ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:equuleus bash

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

164

Then in the Docker terminal run the following commands:

./configure --architecture amd64

sudo make iso

9.8.7.2 Upload the ISO image to the Proxmox VE server

1. Via the web GUI navigate to Datacenter -> your server -> local.
2. In the right hand pane select ISO Images and then upload.
3. Upload the ISO image
Tip: you can also pass the checksum to the Proxmox VE upload tool

9.8.7.3 Create VyOS virtual machine

1. From the top right of the web GUI select Create VM
2. In the appearing dialogue type a Name “VyOS” and optionally select advanced and

Start at boot

3. On the next tab select the target ISO image
4. On the System tab leave everything as default
5. n the Disk tab leave the defaults (this exceeds requirements https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/installation/install.html)
6. On the CPU tab:

Sockets: 1, Cores: 2
7. On the Memory tab
Memory: 4096MiB
8. On the Network tab

Choose the bridge with the internet vmbr0 (it is possible to add the second later) and
leave the defaults including ﬁrewall
Conﬁrm all the settings on the next tab but do not select start after created
Navigate to the newly created VM on the left-hand pane then selected Hardware
from the menu that is presented on the right. Choose Add and then Network Device.
In the dialogue that appears select the Internal network bridge (vmbr1 in this case)
that was created earlier and leave all other options as is.
So, the VM will have the following Network Devices:
net0: Internet
net1: Internal only

9. Start the VM and connect the console (top right)

10. Login with vyos and vyos

Run the command:

$ install image

11. Follow the instructions
12. Set the CD/DVD to none in Web GUI
13. Reboot

9.8.7.4 Conﬁgure VyOS

Open a noVNC window to the host
Login with vyos and vyos
Switch to conﬁgure mode:

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

165

vyos@vyos$ configure
vyos@vyos#

Then conﬁgure as desired. Below is conﬁguration used in the setup here (if you use for
inspiration do take care to replace the x and y octet values correctly with previously chosen
values. The z octet value should be something unused in the outside LAN for which the
host is physically connected):

set interfaces ethernet eth0 address ’192.168.x.z/24’
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description ’OUTSIDE’
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.x.254 distance 1
set service dns forwarding system
set service dns forwarding name-server 192.168.x.254
set service dns forwarding listen-address 192.168.y.1
set service dns forwarding allow-from 192.168.y.0/24
set system name -server 192.168.x.254

set interfaces ethernet eth1 address ’192.168.y.1/24’
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description ’INSIDE’

set nat source rule 100 outbound-interface eth0
set nat source rule 100 source address 192.168.y.0/24
set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade

set service ssh listen-address 0.0.0.0

Once done remember to commit the conﬁg (correcting any misconﬁguration) and save.

Inspiration for the above was taken from: https://bertvv.github.io/cheat-sheets/VyOS.html
@todo: hardening, IDS, IPS

9.8.8 Install and conﬁgure a Debian virtual machine

This VM can be used for various tasks such as software compilation and testing of the
networks. In this setup the Debian VM was used to test connectivity to the VyOS gateway
and the Internet. It is also used in the subsequent stages to deploy a nix-bitcoin node.

In Proxmox VE create a new virtual machine and conﬁgure the network device to use

the bridge ‘vmbr1’.

Then install Debian and conﬁgure the network adapter within the VM with the follow-

ing settings:

IP address: 192.168.y.2 Gateway: 192.168.y.1 DNS: 192.168.y.1
Test that the VM has Internet connectivity.

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

166

9.8.9 Deploying the nix-bitcoin node
This deployment follows the documentation:

https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/#get-started
Take note of the hardware requirements:
https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/blob/master/docs/hardware.md
In the main, the install guide (https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/blob/master/docs/install.md)

is followed verbatim and notes with a reference to particular sections are added where
appropriate.

Optional - a small exception in regards to this setup is that a separate virtual disk
(located on a different physical drive mirror (RAID 1)) was used to store the bitcoin
database - this is optional and details are provided on how to achieve it. Also detailed is
how to conﬁgure the network when using the minimal image.

9.8.9.1 Acquiring NixOS

Following section 1.1 make sure the latest NixOS is obtained i.e. do not just copy the
whole wget command outright and make sure to verify the hash against trusted sources
before using the image.

Download the minimal ISO image (https://nixos.org/download.html)
Verify the hash
Upload the ISO to Proxmox VE server

9.8.9.2 Create a new VM

Name: NixOS

Follow the setup and leave everything as default until the CPU page. The following

conﬁguration was used, which should exceed the minimum requirements:

Cores: 4
Memory: 4096MiB = 4.2GB
Network: vmbr1 (Internal Network)
Do NOT check the select the start the VM checkbox
Next, an additional drive will be conﬁgured in Proxmox VE. This will then be used to

store the bitcoin database within the NixOS VM.

Select Datacenter -> server name and then from the right pane Disks -> LVM-Thin.

Then select Create: Thinpool

From the dialogue select the disk and type a name “data” was used in this setup. This

provisions a vg with the name data and a name data @todo: review

Navigate back to the VM created and choose Hardware and then Add -> Hard Disk
Choose “data” from Storage and then set the size to 560 GiB which equates to about

600GB

Now, continue from section 1.3 in the install instructions
Start the VM and connect a console
sudo -i
With the SeaBios that was used in this setup the ﬁle does not exist and Legacy Boot

(MBR) should be followed (option 2)

Note: no consideration is currently given for encrypted partitions within the Proxmox

VE setup

Enable the OpenSSH daemon

services.openssh.permitRootLogin = "yes";

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

167

Conﬁgure the network conﬁg in conﬁguration.nix (remember to replace y with the

chosen value)

networking.useDHCP = false;
networking.interfaces.ens18.useDHCP = false;

networking.interfaces.ens18.ipv4.addresses = [ {

address= "192.168.y.3";
prefixLength = 24;

} ];
networking.defaultGateway = "192.168.y.1";
networking.nameservers = ["192.168.y.1"];
networking.hostName = "nixicon";

Although the IP above will be assigned once the nix-bitcoin is deployed the installation

cannot continue without a connection to the Internet so that needs to be conﬁgured:

$ ifconfig ens18 192.168.y.3
$ ifconfig ens18 255.255.255.0
$ ip route add 192.168.y.0/24 dev ens18 scope link src 192.168.y.3

Then add the nameserver:

nano /etc/resolv.conf

Add:

nameserver 192.168.y.1

Once the above is complete and successful networking is veriﬁed
Run the following command:
nixos-install
Set the root password and then reboot.

9.8.9.3 Conﬁgure the additional drive (optional)

As the additional drive was not conﬁgured at the time of the install then the parted utility
will need to be available. To achieve this, edit the conﬁguration.nix ﬁle

nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
and add the following:

environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [

parted

];

Then issue the following command:
nixos-rebuild switch
Determine the desired drive, fdisk can assist:
fdisk -l
Note: in this sytem the desired drive is /dev/sdb with 560GiB capacity but sdx is used

in the following examples:

Then partition:
parted /dev/sdx

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

168

(parted) mklabel msdos
(parted) mkpart primary
File system type? ext4
Start? 0%
End? 100%
quit

(note: it is possible to combine the above as a single line command)
Then create the ﬁle system:
mkfs.ext4 -L data /dev/sdx1
Make a note of the UUID as this will be used in the next steps to mount the volume

9.8.9.4 Create port forwarding rules for SSH (optional)

Providing SSH access to the VMs from outside the private network makes it easier to
conﬁgure them (ability to copy and paste UUIDs etc.)

This involve updates to VyOS conﬁguration and can be temporary.
Login to the vyos, you should be able do this from your local machine now as apposed

to the console

ssh vyos@192.168.x.z

Debian 192.168. y .2

The following commands were issued to the VyOS router (obiously replacing y with

the value chosen earlier)

configure

set nat destination rule 12 description ’Port Forward: 2222 to 22 SSH on 192.168.y.2’
set nat destination rule 12 destination port ’2222’
set nat destination rule 12 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 12 protocol ’tcp’
set nat destination rule 12 translation address ’192.168.y.2’
set nat destination rule 12 translation port ’22’

commit

Now test
Note: for the Debian VM the user account may need to be added to the SSH user group
Note: you could SSH from Debian to all other hosts

NixOS 192.168. y .3

Assuming access to the Debian VM via SSH is working then from the same VyOs

conﬁgure session issue the following:

set nat destination rule 13 description ’Port Forward: 2223 to 22 SSH on 192.168.y.3’
set nat destination rule 13 destination port ’2223’
set nat destination rule 13 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 13 protocol ’tcp’
set nat destination rule 13 translation address ’192.168.y.3’
set nat destination rule 13 translation port ’22’

commit

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

169

Test and if all is well, save the VyOS conﬁguration:

save

Credit: https://support.vyos.io/en/kb/articles/nat-principles
Having SSH access to both the Debian and NixOS VMs will make the next stages of

the process a little easier

@todo hardening (SSH e.g. add keys, remove plain text or remove SSH access entirely)

9.8.9.5 Prepare nix-bitcoin NixOS package

This section continues to follow the guide from Nix Installation.

Note: this part of the guide will be executed on the Debian VM that was installed

earlier

The next steps will follow section 2.
You may need to add your user to the sudoers if it is not a member already
In Debian this can be achieved with the following commands
Switch to root
su
Then
sudo usermod -a -G sudo username
Exit both the root and user session and then log back in as the user
Important: ensure that when downloading the multi-user NixOS that the latest is
obtained (listed at https://nixos.org/download.html). I.e. dont just copy and paste verbatim.

Note: It is possible to determine the latest version by navigating to: https://nixos.org/nix/install

and this will redirect to for example: https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.6.0/install at the
time of writing. From here you could quickly santiy check the redirect by heading to:
https://releases.nixos.org/?preﬁx=nix/

You could (as in the example on the NixOS website) use curl with a -L option which

will ignore the redirect

Enter a directory to receive the ﬁles. ~/Downloads was chosen for this setup
For completeness the following commands were issued:
curl -o install-nix-2.6.0 https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.6.0/install
with the -o option writing the contents to a ﬁle rather than displaying on screen
then
curl -o install-nix-2.6.0.asc https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.6.0/install.asc
then
gpg2 --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys B541D55301270E0BCF15CA5D8170B4726D7198DE

gpg2 --verify ./install-nix-2.6.0.asc

Which are similarly detailed here: https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-verify-installation
Note: it is not required to run the script as sudo. It will prompt for permission.
In this setup the:

substitute = false

was added to /etc/nix/nix.conf as detailed.
Run the script.
Exit the terminal and login in again as per the message:

9.8 Lab - virtualisation, networking, Bitcoin

170

Try it! Open a new terminal, and type:

$ nix-shell -p nix-info --run "nix-info -m"

The next part continues with setting up the deployment directory
Stood in the home directory or one just off it, follow the instructions provided.
Once the above is complete continue with the deploy with krops section.
Follow the instructions and edit the SSH conﬁg. You will need a public/private key

pair for this and this article could be useful.

The conﬁg ﬁle used in this setup is shown below:

Host nixicon

# FIXME
Hostname 192.168.y.3
User root
PubkeyAuthentication yes
# FIXME
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

}

In subsection 3 the guide shows how to optionally disallow substitutes. This was set to

true in this setup.

In subsection 4 the guide details copying hardware-conﬁguration.nix ﬁle to the deploy-
ment directory and then in subsection 5 making edits to the conﬁguration.nix ﬁle to turn
on desired modules. There are some important notes relevant to this setup to make here:

Additional hard drive conﬁguration No edits were made to hardware-conﬁguration.nix
as per the warning at the top of the ﬁle. For reference here is the ﬁle from this setup:

# Do not modify this file!
# and may be overwritten by future invocations. Please make changes
# to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix instead.
{ config, lib, pkgs, modulesPath, ... }:

It was generated by ‘nixos-generate-config’

{

imports =

[ (modulesPath + "/profiles/qemu-guest.nix")
];

boot.initrd.availableKernelModules = [ "ata_piix" "uhci_hcd" "virtio_pci" "virtio_scsi" "sd_mod" "sr_mod" ];
boot.initrd.kernelModules = [ ];
boot.kernelModules = [ ];
boot.extraModulePackages = [ ];
boot.loader.grub.device = "/dev/sda";

fileSystems."/" =

{ device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID_1";

fsType = "ext4";

};

swapDevices =

[ { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID_2"; }
];

hardware.cpu.intel.updateMicrocode = lib.mkDefault config.hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware;

}

Rather, the additional hard drive was conﬁgured in the conﬁguration.nix as shown here:

fileSystems."/var/lib" =
{ device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID_3";

fsType = "ext4";

};

This mounts /var/lib (which contains the bitcoin database etc.) to the additional drive.

Static IP conﬁguration To conﬁgure the static IP add the following:

networking.useDHCP = false;
networking.interfaces.ens18.useDHCP = false;

networking.interfaces.ens18.ipv4.addresses = [ {

address= "192.168.y.3";
prefixLength = 24;

} ];

9.9 Lab - Vircadia

172

networking.defaultGateway = "192.168.y.1";
networking.nameservers = ["192.168.y.1"];
networking.hostName = "nixicon";

SSH conﬁguration Below is the snipet of conﬁguration. Note: paste the contents of
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub where the # FIXME: Replace this with your SSH pubkey
appears

services.openssh = {

enable = true;
passwordAuthentication = false;

};
users.users.root = {

openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [

# FIXME: Replace this with your SSH pubkey
"ssh-ed25519 LONG_KEY user@debian"

];

};

Services conﬁguration Last but not least, the following services are enabled in this
setup:

services.clightning.enable = true;
services.rtl.enable = true;
services.rtl.nodes.clightning = true;
services.electrs.enable = true;
services.backups.enable = true;

Once the conﬁguration.nix ﬁle has been updated continue from subsection 6.
The how-to continues with a guide to setting up a Vircadia domain server and metaverse

server

9.9 Lab - Vircadia

9.9.1 Overview

This part of the how-to serves as a guide to setting up a Vircadia domain server and
metaverse server within the Proxmox VE environment.

To familiarise with the technology stack the Vircadia architecture overview document

is a good place to start and the GitHub contains documentation and source.

9.9.2 Deploy a Vircadia domain server

There are few different options to deploy a server. This guide will use the Linux compile
from source method.

Various Linux distributions are supported and in this setup, Ubuntu 20.04 was selected.

9.9 Lab - Vircadia

173

Figure 9.5: Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Settings

9.9.2.1 Prepare a virtual instance of Ubuntu 20.04 in the Proxmox Virtual Environ-

ment

First, obtain the Ubuntu 20.04 desktop image.

Then deploy a virtual machine in Proxmox VE as was done with VyOS and Debian in

the previous sections. The following values were selected for this setup:

Disk drive: 64GiB
CPU: 2 sockets 2 cores
RAM: 8192GiB
Network adapter: vmbr1 (internal)
Name: vircadia-server

When prompted by the installer to choose the packages to install choose ‘minimal’.
Remember to remove the media.
Once booted, head to settings:
Then conﬁgure the network connection with the manual method:
With the following:
IP address: 192.168.y.4

Gateway: 192.168.y.1
DNS: 192.168.y.1
Mask 255.255.255.0

Run the software updater.
Restart and run the software updater again.
Once the Operating System is up to date open a terminal and install git:
sudo apt install git
Follow the Vircadia build instructions along side this how-to guide.
Stood in your home directory or similar run the following:

git clone https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-builder.git
cd vircadia-builder
chmod +x vircadia-builder

9.9 Lab - Vircadia

174

Figure 9.6: Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Settings - Network

As this setup requires both the domain server and the ICE server, run the following:
./vircadia-builder –build=server,ice-server
It is also possible to add a ‘client’ option but this was not opted for in this setup as the

client was Windows based.

Follow the prompts (defaults were accepted in this setup). The installation process will

begin as shown below:

The ﬁrst stage of the installer will install dependency packages, follow the instruction

and then if prompted run the build command again.

Note: if you have followed the guide then Qt will not be installed on the target system,

however, the installer will build the correct version - see below:

Once complete (which could take several hours for the Qt step) a text output similar to

the following should be presented:

Cleaning up install directory...done
Copied : 4626
Skipped: 3208
Deleted: 0
Creating script for assignment-client...done.

Navigate up one from the build directory and into the Vircadia folder. In here there
should be a build folder with the built binaries and accompanying scripts - these are the
scripts that will be run later (@todo: section link: ### Conﬁgure the Vircadia server) once
port forwarding is conﬁgured.

9.9.2.2 Conﬁgure port forwarding for Vircadia services

The following ports are required:

40100 (+0): (tcp) administrative http connection
40101 (+1): (tcp) administrative https (encrypted) connection
40102 (+2): (udp) main connection from clients
40103 (+3): (udp) main connection from clients (encrypted)
Note: in this setup non TLS versions are currently used for testing.
Important: for a production version of the system it would be prudent to enable TLS

and completely disallow non TLS trafﬁc (i.e. remove the port forwarding rules)

set nat destination rule 15 description ’Port Forward: 40100 (+0): (tcp) administrative http connection on 192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 15 destination port ’40100’
set nat destination rule 15 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 15 protocol ’tcp’
set nat destination rule 15 translation address ’192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 15 translation port ’40100’

set nat destination rule 16 description ’Port Forward: 40101 (+1): (tcp) administrative https (encrypted) connection on 192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 16 destination port ’40101’
set nat destination rule 16 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 16 protocol ’tcp’
set nat destination rule 16 translation address ’192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 16 translation port ’40101’

set nat destination rule 17 description ’Port Forward: 40102 (+2): (udp) main connection from clients on 192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 17 destination port ’40102’
set nat destination rule 17 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 17 protocol ’tcp’

9.9.2.4 Conﬁgure the Vircadia server

As per the information message:

“Connect a web browser to the server at port 40100. (If you are on the machine that
the server is running on, this would be http://localhost:40100) Complete the initial setup
wizard and you should have a functioning domain.”

With the port forwarding in place it should be possible to access the web interface on:

192.168.x.z:40100

Start the conﬁguration:
Select skip on the import settings and/or content page:
Select skip on the connect to metaverse account page:

Conﬁgure security settings for your domain:
Create an admin user for the web panel:
Choose if you would like to turn performance mode on (in the setup described here

performance mode was turned on):
Complete the installation.

9.9.3 Deploy a Vircadia metaverse server

Installation and conﬁguration here follows the Vircadia metaverse build guide and Iamus:
Notes On Development.

It is possible to install and run the Vircadia metaverse server on the same server as the

domain server, however, in this setup another VM was used (separation of concerns).

Note: make sure to put VM disk on the ﬁrst local-lvm partition and not the Bitcoin

speciﬁc one.

Create another VM as in the previous steps with the following conﬁguration:
Disk drive: 64GiB
CPU: 2 sockets 2 cores
RAM: 8192GiB
Network adapter: vmbr1 (internal)
Name: vircadia-metaverse-server

Perform a minimal install of Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop and conﬁgure the network as

follows:

IP address: 192.168.y.5

9.9 Lab - Vircadia

179

Figure 9.11: Vircadia server conﬁguration import page

Gateway: 192.168.y.1
DNS: 192.168.y.1
Mask 255.255.255.0

Run the software updater.
Restart and run the software updater again.

9.9.3.1 Install Node.js and NPM

Following the building and conﬁguration guide:

Note: as of writing the Node and NPM versions in the package manager are too
low (node > 14 and npm > 6 are required) so do not use those. Instead navigate to:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and get the latest LTS (version: 16.14.2 (includes npm
8.5.0) as of writing).

The following is taken from the Node installation guide:

sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/nodejs
sudo tar -xJvf node-v16.14.2-linux-x64.tar.xz -C /usr/local/lib/nodejs/

nano ~/.profile

Add:

export PATH=/usr/local/lib/nodejs/node-v16.14.2-linux-x64/bin:$PATH

and refresh (@todo) and check

9.9.3.3 Conﬁgure the Mongo DB for the metaverse server

Note: the Mongo DB could run on a separate VM (further separation of concerns).

The Vircadia metaverse build guide is shown using version 4.4 so this guide will use
the same (though it maybe possible to use a later version (@todo: a comment in Discord
mentions success with 5.0.2):

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
Follow the installation instructions for Ubuntu 20.04 (assuming that this is the distribu-

tion that has been chosen to install the metaverse server on).

Once the Mongo DB is complete it can be veriﬁed as below:

Enable MongoDB’s free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

9.9.3.6 Conﬁguring NAT reﬂection on the VyOS router (testing)

Many routers will automatically conﬁgure NAT reﬂection for open ports and VyOS can be
conﬁgured to perform NAT reﬂection. This requires a few updates to the existing rules
that have been conﬁgured. NAT reﬂection would be useful for internal only debugging,
however, in testing the ICE server from the build would only bind to the external internet
routable IP thus hindering the ability to use internally. As using ICE for internal only is
an edge case this is actually as expected although future work could look into updating
the ICE server and conﬁguring split DNS (feel free to update with suggestions). With
this in mind the setup described here, at present, does not require NAT reﬂection but the
following updates should enable it if desired:

set nat destination rule 16 destination address 192.168.x.z
set nat destination rule 17 destination address 192.168.x.z
set nat destination rule 18 destination address 192.168.x.z
set nat destination rule 20 destination address 192.168.x.z
set nat destination rule 21 destination address 192.168.x.z

set nat destination rule 16 inbound-interface any
set nat destination rule 17 inbound-interface any
set nat destination rule 18 inbound-interface any
set nat destination rule 20 inbound-interface any
set nat destination rule 21 inbound-interface any

9.9.3.7 Enabling external access

Important note: in a development and testing environment (such as the one detailed here)
the VyOS router should not be permanently connected to the internet and access should
only be allowed whilst tests are being performed and if possible tied down to speciﬁc
source addresses. To allow testing the external ﬁrewall requires port forwarding. The port
forwarding rules can be turned on and off as desired.
The following port forwarding rules are required:

9.9.3.8 Start the services

The process of starting the services is as follows (see: Building and Running Ice-Server
and Domain-Server
Metaverse server service On the metaverse server open a terminal and run:

cd vircadia-metaverse

node/dist/index.ts

ICE server Start ice-server.

On the vircadia server open a terminal and run:

cd Vircadia/vircadiaBuildDir
export HIFI_METAVERSE_URL=http://a.b.c.d:9400
./run_ice-server

Domain server services Start domain-server.

Open another terminal and run:

cd Vircadia/vircadiaBuildDir
export HIFI_METAVERSE_URL=http://a.b.c.d:9400
export ICE_SERVER=a.b.c.d:7337
./run_domain-server -i ${ICE_SERVER}

Start assignment client.
Open another terminal and run:

cd Vircadia/vircadiaBuildDir
./run_assignment-client

Client interface For testing the client application the Windows OS was opted for and
Vircadia 2022.1.1 was used.

9.9.3.9 Connecting the Metaverse server and conﬁguring a test Metaverse ac-

count

Navigate to:

http://192.168.x.y:40100/settings/#metaverse_group (or use the external IP a.b.c.d)
Then click ‘Connect Metaverse Account’
A new page should open (http://a.b.c.d:9400/static/DomainTokenLogin.html) with the
option to ‘create account’. Do this and then enter the username and password on the
‘Get Token’. Copy this token and then go back to the previous page and paste it in the
open dialogue and click connect. The Networking / Metaverse section should now display
‘Metaverse Account Connected’.

Note: at this point you could create a few more accounts for testing.

9.9.3.10 Connecting a client

If you are testing locally then you will probably need to use a VPN so that your connection
is routed from outside your local network. This is due to the ICE server and how it will
create open ports. The NAT reﬂection required will probably not work on the external
router for non static port forwarding rules.

From tests it appears that the best way to run the client is to start it from the command
line with the IP for the domain server (at least for the initial run and then it seems to work
ﬁne then in).

For the initial run the following was actioned:
Open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows in this case), navigate to the folder containing

the Vircadia executable and run:

.\interface.exe --url 84.92.193.1

Then in the interface navigate to File -> Metaverse: Login / Sign Up
Enter the details as follows:
Display name: XYZ Username: usernameCreatedInPreviousStep Password: password-

CreatedInPreviousStep URL: http://a.b.c.d:9400

Then click ‘Log in to metaverse’

9.9.3.11 Conﬁgure SSH access for domain and metaverse servers (optional)

For potentially easier debugging, enable SSH on the servers.

Open a terminal and type:
sudo apt install openssh-server
Then conﬁgure the following rules on the VyOS router:

Domain server Then set up port forwarding on the VyOS router. . . @todo add $VyOS

configure

set nat destination rule 14 description ’Port Forward: 2224 to 22 SSH on 192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 14 destination port ’2224’
set nat destination rule 14 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 14 protocol ’tcp’
set nat destination rule 14 translation address ’192.168.y.4’
set nat destination rule 14 translation port ’22’

commit

9.9 Lab - Vircadia

Test the SSH access and if all works well:

save

Metaverse server Conﬁgure SSH access and port forwarding on the VyOS if desired:

configure

set nat destination rule 19 description ’Port Forward: 2225 to 22 SSH on 192.168.y.5’
set nat destination rule 19 destination port ’2225’
set nat destination rule 19 inbound-interface ’eth0’
set nat destination rule 19 protocol ’tcp’
set nat destination rule 19 translation address ’192.168.y.5’
set nat destination rule 19 translation port ’22’
