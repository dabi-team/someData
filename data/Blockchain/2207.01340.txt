Abstract—Rapidly growing distributed ledger technologies
(DLTs) have recently received attention among researchers in
both industry and academia. While a lot of existing analysis
(mainly) of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks is available,
the lack of measurements for other crypto projects is observed.
This article addresses questions about tokenomics and wealth
distributions in cryptocurrencies. We analyze the time-dependent
statistical properties of top cryptocurrency holders for 14 dif-
ferent distributed ledger projects. The provided metrics include
approximated Zipf coefﬁcient, Shannon entropy, Gini coefﬁcient,
and Nakamoto coefﬁcient. We show that there are quantitative
differences between the coins (cryptocurrencies operating on
their own independent network) and tokens (which operate on top
of a smart contract platform). Presented results show that coins
and tokens have different values of approximated Zipf coefﬁcient
and centralization levels. This work is relevant for DLTs as
it might be useful in modeling and improving the committee
selection process, especially in decentralized autonomous organi-
zations (DAOs) and delegated proof of stake (DPoS) blockchains.

I. INTRODUCTION

in distributed systems throughout

The advent of Bitcoin [13] has given rise to an increasing
the 2010s. The
interest
newly created space of cryptocurrencies has attracted many
scientists, programmers, and business investors. Due to the
complexity of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), their
development requires expertise in many ﬁelds of science,
including applied mathematics, cryptography, game theory,
economics, peer-to-peer (p2p) networks, and coding theory.
In the ﬁrst years of DLTs, questions of technological nature
received the most attention as the problems like consensus
mechanism and peer-to-peer layer are at
the core of any
such technology. Unfortunately, questions about economics,
cryptocurrencies distributions and tokenomics took a back seat
in academic research of cryptocurrencies and have not been
sufﬁciently addressed (with a few notable exceptions).

This is unfortunate as the Bitcoin pseudo-anonymous ac-
count model allows for transaction transparency unprecedented
in traditional ﬁnancial systems, where almost all payments
are private and highly sensitive. Furthermore, Bitcoin enabled
new monetary models and deployed them on a global scale.
Notably, the amount of Bitcoin currency units is capped at 21

million. However, due to some Bitcoin wallets being lost, as a
result of negligence or human error, Bitcoin’s monetary policy
is effectively deﬂationary. The monetary policy is not the only
important factor cryptocurrency distribution. Even technology
solutions like consensus mechanisms might inﬂuence cryp-
tocurrency distribution. In this context, a comparison of Proof-
of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mecha-
nisms is very informative. In PoW, newly created units of
currency are rewarded to the specialized users, called miners,
who have access to efﬁcient Application-Speciﬁc Integrated
Circuit (ASIC). PoW miners might hold a large number of
cryptocurrency units; however, a large portion of mined re-
wards must be sold to cover expenses like electricity bills, rent,
and amortization costs of ASIC machines. In PoS systems,
however, new tokens are rewarded to stakers who hold a large
number of cryptocurrency units. Unlike PoW miners, PoS
stakers do not experience high costs and are incentivized not
to sell their rewards as doing so increases their revenue in the
future. This illustrates that even supposedly monetary-agnostic
technology solutions might inﬂuence tokenomics.

This paper partially addresses the questions of cryptocur-
rency tokenomics. We analyze the distribution of the top
richest accounts in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum,
and selected ERC20 tokens. Our analysis involves in the data
sets snapshotted at different dates with a given time interval.
We use such data sets to measure different statistical metrics
and analyze their evolution over time. Previous studies [6],
[7], [10] showed that
the distributions of the top richest
balances might be modeled with Zipf’s law. We expand on
these results and study the time evolution of Zipf’s law
coefﬁcient associated with such distributions. Notably, we
analyze cryptocurrencies that, to our best knowledge, have
never been analyzed before using similar methods. Next, we
proceed with a thorough analysis of a series of centralization
metrics like Shannon entropy, Gini
index, and Nakamoto
coefﬁcient. These metrics are used to answer the main question
addressed in this paper, which is formulated as follows:
Are there any quantitative differences between top account
balances in cryptocurrency “coins” and “tokens”? Therefore,
the novelty of this work comprises the following two aspects:
(i) studying quantitative differences between coins and tokens

 
 
 
 
 
 
and (ii) examining cryptocurrencies whose analysis is missed
in the literature.

A distinction between cryptocurrency coins and tokens was
made in [22], where authors deﬁne coins as operating on their
own independent ledger/network and tokens as operating on
top of a coin network (typically smart contract platforms as
Ethereum or Cardano). For the purposes of this paper, we use
the same deﬁnitions.

This research might be particularly interesting for DLTs,
where a group of top cryptocurrency holders fulﬁlls a special
role. Examples include Decentralized Autonomous Organiza-
tions (DAOs) in which a committee of top token holders is re-
sponsible for DAO governance or treasury management. Other
examples are Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains,
where a relatively small committee of block validators issues
ledger updates or distributed random number generators based
on the threshold signature scheme. Since our research is
focused on a relatively small group of top token holders, it can
be directly applied to modeling the aforementioned examples.
This is also reasonable as the typical size of the threshold
signature committee is limited by the message complexity
(up to 50—100 nodes). Our research might help to improve
the committee selection process as we provide a range of
parameters of Zipf’s law coefﬁcient, which might be used as
a model of cryptocurrency distribution.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section,
we discuss related work and introduce the methods and tools
used in this paper. Section III is devoted to the presentation
and analysis of the results. In the last section, we conclude
our ﬁndings and discuss future research.

II. RELATED WORK AND METHODOLOGY

One of the ﬁrst works analyzing Bitcoin using network
characteristics over time (as well as the wealth statistics and
the temporal patterns of transactions) is presented in [6].
The authors showed that the wealth of top Bitcoin holders
grows faster than the wealth of low balance accounts—this
phenomenon is well known as preferential attachment, and it
plays an essential role in the formation of the wealth distri-
bution. Additionally, the Gini coefﬁcients were also computed
to measure wealth inequality. Analysis of the Bitcoin network
from a perspective of mining pools can be found in [20],
in which the authors studied how characteristics of mining
pools such as computing power, hash rate, mining revenue,
the
transaction collection strategies, and block size affect
security of the network, transaction delays, and fees. Their
measurement results showed that more than 50% of the blocks
were created by the top 5 mining pools, which may raise
security and centralization concerns for the Bitcoin network.
The results of similar research to our work were presented
in [11]. Speciﬁcally, the authors provided their analysis using
three different metrics (Gini coefﬁcient, Shannon entropy,
and Nakamoto coefﬁcient) and their evolution over time. It
was found that the degree of decentralization in Bitcoin is
higher and more volatile, while the degree of decentralization
in Ethereum is smaller and more stable. Jensen et al. [4]

analyzed decentralization of governance token distribution in
four decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) applications on the Ethereum
blockchain using Gini and Nakamoto coefﬁcients. Their re-
sults indicated that the token distributions for all four DeFi
applications are characterized by high Gini coefﬁcients. Sim-
ilar methods were used in [10], where PoW and PoS-based
cryptocurrencies were compared. The authors analyzed the
decentralization of Bitcoin and Steem using Shannon entropy.
However, their analysis was limited to only two cryptocurren-
cies and did not account for time changes in the distribution.
The authors of [22] constructed a growth model for a market
capitalization of cryptocurrencies using Gibrat’s law. They
also pointed out that crypto coins (which operate on their
own independent DLT network) and crypto tokens (which
operate on top of another coin platform) follow Zipf’s law
for their capitalization. Although, the parameter of Zipf’s law
is quantitatively different for coins and tokens.

A large part of research in such literature has been devoted
to the analysis of the properties of cryptocurrencies networks
from a graph perspective where each transaction is represented
by a link in a graph of addresses [2], [9]–[11], [15], [16], [19].
For example, Lehnberg [9] aimed to determine whether the
relationships between the users of ERC20 token networks and
their valuations follow Metcalfe’s law. It was found that only
two tokens of 50 seem to obey Metcalfe’s law, while the rest
follow a linear or sub-linear law.

A. Data collection and cryptocurrency wallets

Many blockchain networks do not store balances associated
with addresses; however, balances can be calculated from the
sum of sent and received assets (i.e., coins or tokens) for
each address. In this work, we use public blockchain datasets
available on Google BigQuery1. Starting from the genesis
block of a particular blockchain, we collected historical trans-
action/transfer data until January 16, 2022, inclusive. In the
case of some ERC20 tokens, the ﬁrst few weeks of the data
had been skipped before the analysis due to the insufﬁcient
number of transactions. This early period could have been
devoted to testing or marketing. Including these data could
bring artifacts2

It is important to note that the data presented in this paper
does not represent the wealth of individual cryptocurrency
owners but rather the wealth distribution among the cryptocur-
rency wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets are not unique to a user,
and one user can be in possession of multiple such wallets.
The true identity of addresses owners is hard to establish and
might be problematic even for entities that have access to the
cryptocurrency exchanges’ data. Aware of these limits, we ﬁnd
the distribution of wealth in the richest cryptocurrency wallets
to be still interesting as the basis of identity systems in PoS
systems and DAOs are wallets (see section II-B).

2For example, there were no token transfers for the ﬁrst few weeks after

the inception of the Tether (USDT) smart contract.

B. Sample size N

In this paper, we analyze the properties of the empirical
distribution function for the top N richest accounts. Such
empirical distributions are discrete, and the value of the i-
th entry is the ratio of the i-th richest account balance to the
sum of N richest account balances. We focus on a relatively
small sample size N between 30—100. These numbers might
seem arbitrary and small, especially in the face of thousands
and tens of thousands of cryptocurrency users. However, this
interval is interesting for applications in DPoS DLTs based
on Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) [1], [12], [17] consensus
mechanisms.

In the most standard versions of BFT consensus mecha-
nisms, the number of consensus participants is ﬁxed, and their
identities are known. Such systems are permissioned and not
suitable for direct use in fully permissionless DLTs. However,
an interesting modiﬁcation to BFT design is used by a series
of DPoS blockchains. These projects use an intermediary
step between open and permissionless networks. Any user is
allowed to set up a node and collect tokens, but only the most
reliable nodes with the most stake contribute to the consensus
directly. An illustration of the procedure of establishing con-
sensus based on the ﬁxed-size closed committee in open and
permissionless systems is depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1: Process of ﬁnding ﬁxed-size closed committee in open
permissionless systems with stake delegation.

An example of a DPoS protocol is EOS3, in which blocks
are produced by a committee of 21 validators who collec-
tively sign the new blocks using an asynchronous version
of the BFT consensus mechanism [8]. Committee members
are selected and periodically rotated based on the amount of
stake which was delegated to them by other network users.
Other examples include Lisk4, which uses 101 nodes, and
Internet Computer (ICP)5 with the 101 nodes in the Neural

3https://eos.io/
4https://lisk.com/
5https://dﬁnity.org/

Nervous System (ICP’s main blockchain). In theory, the size
of block producing committee can be unbounded. However,
in practice, the procedure of signing new blocks is limited by
the bandwidth—the number of messages exchanged among
the committee members grows like a square of its size. In
the most practical applications, the block-producing committee
has from 10 to 50 committee members. Some of the multi-
blockchain protocols might afford to use up to 100 nodes in
some parts of their protocol; however, in these cases, the block
production time suffers. These limits explain our interest in a
relatively small interval of the sample size of N , namely 30—
100, which might be used to model the token distribution
among block validators or improve the committee selection
process.

C. Zipf’s law

The Zipf’s distribution is a discrete distribution commonly
found in physics and social sciences. It was empirically
conﬁrmed that the Zipf’s law describes a variety of effects
in quantitative linguistics [23], the study of country and city
population [3], and web sites references and other effects.
Perhaps the most relevant for this paper are applications of
the Zipf’s law in modeling the wealth in societies [5], and the
distribution of token holders in various cryptocurrencies [6],
[7], [10].

Zipf’s distribution f (k; N, s) is indexed by two parameters:
(i) an integer number N , which is the number of elements,
and (ii) a real-valued parameter s—the exponent of the distri-
bution. The value of the k-th element satisﬁes

f (k; N, s) = H(s, N )−1k−s,

(1)

where H(s, N ) = (cid:80)N

i=1 i−s is the normalization factor.

D. Centralization metrics

In this paper, we discuss multiple centralization metrics
like Gini and Nakamoto coefﬁcient. We want to stress again
that analyzed sample size N is relatively small and can
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence values of these metrics due to the
normalization factor H(s, N ) in Eq. (1).

Analyzed metrics are denoted using variables labeled by
an integer index i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N . The percentage of
assets (i.e., coins or tokens) held by the i-th user is denoted
by xi such that xi are ordered and normalized to one, i.e.,
x1 ≥ x2 ≥ ... ≥ xN and (cid:80)N

i=1 xi = 1.
1) Entropy: Entropy (Shannon entropy) is a centralization
metric commonly used in physics, especially in quantum
information theory (Von Neumann entropy), thermodynamics,
and statistical physics. Entropy S is deﬁned as

S = −

N
(cid:88)

i=1

xi log(xi).

(2)

In the general case, the values of entropy are unbounded.
However, when the number of available states N is ﬁxed, then
the entropy takes values from an interval [0, log(N )]. Maximal
centralization corresponds to the entropy equal to zero, and
decentralization grows with entropy.

of cryptocurrencies. It is deﬁned as

III. RESULTS

A series of plots that show the evolution of statistical
metrics for the top accounts are given in Figs. 2-5. We present
the data for two sample sizes N = 30 and N = 100.
Cryptocurrencies are divided into two groups. The ﬁrst group
consists of coins, which include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum
(ETH), Litecoin (LTC), DASH, Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin
Cash (BCH), and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The second group
includes ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum chain: Chainlink
(LINK), DAI, Uniswap (UNI), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC),
Polygon (MATIC), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC).
Note that BCH and ETC are “forks” of BTC and ETH,
respectively. This means that BCH and BTC (ETC and ETH)
share ledger values before the fork6. To avoid data duplication,
we present the data for forked coins only after the split date.
Each ﬁgure contains four subplots with (1) approximated
Zipf’s law coefﬁcient, (2) Shannon entropy, (3) Gini coef-
ﬁcient, and (4) Nakamoto coefﬁcient. The Zipf’s law coef-
ﬁcients were obtained using linear regression on the double
logarithmic scale, while the remaining metrics are computed
using deﬁnitions from Section II-D. Plots of time evolution
were supplemented with the tables of average values of four
analyzed quantities (see Tables I-IV).

A cursory analysis of the time-dependent data reveals that,
in an initial period (just after inception), cryptocurrencies
experience a volatile evolution, with rapid changes in analyzed
quantities. The length of this initial period varies and can take
from a couple of months to a couple of years in the case of
the oldest coins. After the initial period ends, metrics evolve
less dynamically, and their evolution resembles a random walk
around an average value. A great example of this behavior
is the data for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s metrics show the greatest
volatility in a period of approximately two years after the
genesis block (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). Curiously, the extreme
values of analyzed quantities coincide with the date of the

famous “Bitcoin pizza transaction” (May 22, 2010)7. The
“Bitcoin pizza transaction” might be interpreted as Bitcoin
leaving its “infancy”, experimental stage, and slowly being
adopted as a payment method. Before May 2010, Bitcoin was
rarely exchanged among users and was not used as payment
for commodities.

The data for ERC20 tokens were collected for a signiﬁcantly
shorter time period than coins (4 years vs. 12 years). This is
expected since ERC20 tokens are relatively new cryptocur-
rencies deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, due
to the more speculative nature, ERC20 have typically much
smaller market capitalization and less active addresses than
coins.

6The ledgers of BCH and BTC split on August 1, 2017. The split date for

ETC and ETH is July 20, 2016.

7The “Bitcoin pizza transaction” is a Bitcoin transfer made by Laszlo
Hanyecz who spent 10,000 Bitcoins at a local pizza restaurant to buy two
pizzas.

The biggest outlier in the group of ERC20 tokens is
Chainlink (LINK). The Chainlink token distribution is very
concentrated on the whole time interval—with the Gini coefﬁ-
cient around 0.8 and a surprisingly small Nakamoto coefﬁcient
of 2. This is a result of an extreme number of tokens in the

richest address dubbed “Chainlink: Node Operators” (even up
to 35% of the whole token supply)8. Furthermore, two next
richest addresses, which both belong to the team who develops
the Chainlink token, have approximately 5% of the total

Other tokens also experienced extremely high centralization
(Tether, USD Coin), however, only Chainlink’s distribution is
so concentrated on the whole analyzed interval.

Let us now focus on the main question of this paper, which
is what the differences are between the statistical metrics

of cryptocurrency coins and ERC20 tokens. We note that
a similar, although not
the same problem, was examined
in [22], where the authors analyzed the market capitalization
of cryptocurrencies. The authors found that capitalization of
both coins and tokens follows qualitatively the same power
law. However, there are quantitative differences; namely, the

TABLE IV: Average Nakamoto coefﬁcient of the token distri-
bution for the top 30, 50, and 100 token holders in selected
cryptocurrencies.

estimated Zipf’s law coefﬁcient for coins is between 0.5—0.7
and for tokens, this value is closer to 1.0—1.3.

In this paper, we address the question of quantitative differ-
ences in the token distributions of coins and tokens. Tables I-
IV show that the analyzed statistical quantities for tokens and
coins take different values. For example, the Zipf’s law coef-
ﬁcient of different coins, is for the most part, conﬁned within
the range of 0.4—1.25, while for ERC20 tokens, this range
is 0.7—2.25 (see the top panel in Figs. 2-5). Furthermore,
coins are typically less concentrated—the Gini coefﬁcient is
in the range 0.1—0.7, and the Nakamoto coefﬁcient varies
within 10—25 (for sample size N = 100). For tokens, the Gini
coefﬁcient is around 0.5—0.9, and the Nakamoto coefﬁcient
varies within 2-8 (N = 100). Nevertheless, it is worth stressing
that the Gini coefﬁcient for the ERC20 tokens has a declining
tendency, and it might reach levels similar to coins at the same

maturity level. One illustration of a tendency for the decreasing
centralization are stablecoins9 Tether and USD Coin. Both
tokens start with extremely centralized token distribution as
indicated by the Gini coefﬁcient close to 1, but, as time passes,
centralization signiﬁcantly decreases.

Very low values of the Nakamoto coefﬁcients of ERC20
tokens need to be taken into account while designing tech-
nological solutions. Especially if a given ERC20 token is an
underlying Sybil protection mechanism of a DAO. Some parts
of DAOs with a small Nakamoto coefﬁcient could be paralyzed
or even hijacked by attacking only a tiny number of nodes.
To give a practical example: one popular feature in DAOs is a
distributed Random Number Generator (dRNG). Some of the
dRNG designs [18] are based on threshold signatures, where
a random number is produced by the committee of nodes.
If the collective signature is composed of partial signatures,
weighted by the amount of held tokens, then a small Nakamoto
coefﬁcient might threaten the liveness of the dRNG. To address
such a problem, DAO should adapt dRNG schemes where
all of the partial signatures have the same weight or use a
completely different dRNG scheme. For example, based on
Veriﬁable Delay Functions (VDFs)10.

IV. SUMMARY
In this article, we analyzed the wealth distribution of the
richest addresses in various cryptocurrencies. This included
the time evolution of statistical metrics like the approximated
Zipf’s law coefﬁcient, Shannon entropy, Gini coefﬁcient, and
Nakamoto coefﬁcient, along with their average values. It
was shown that coins and ERC20 tokens have quantitatively
different distributions of wealth. In particular, the values of
approximated Zipf’s law coefﬁcient for coins are 0.4—1.25
and 0.7—2.25 for ERC20 tokens. Differences between the
two groups were also apparent during the study of wealth
centralization. It was observed that tokens are, in general,
much more centralized than coins with higher Gini coefﬁcients
and smaller Nakamoto coefﬁcients.

This research might be of particular interest

to DAOs
and DPoS-based blockchains which rely on some form of
a committee of the richest token holders. Presented values
of statistical metrics like approximated Zipf coefﬁcient or
Nakamoto coefﬁcient might help to model a committee selec-
tion process and make it more secure. Future work will evolve
in two directions. Firstly, we are working on incorporating
more metrics, analyzing more tokens, and considering more
different sample size values. Secondly, the main ﬁndings of
this work will be used to model a committee selection process.
