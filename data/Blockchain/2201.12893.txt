ABSTRACT
Currently, there are no convincing proxies for the fundamentals of
cryptocurrency assets. We propose a new market-to-fundamental
ratio, the price-to-utility (PU) ratio, utilizing unique blockchain ac-
counting methods. We then proxy various fundamental-to-market
ratios by Bitcoin historical data and find they have little predictive
power for short-term bitcoin returns. However, PU ratio effectively
predicts long-term bitcoin returns. We verify PU ratio valuation
by unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The valuation
method informs investment returns and predicts bull markets effec-
tively. Finally, we present an automated trading strategy advised by
the PU ratio that outperforms the conventional buy-and-hold and
market-timing strategies. We distribute the trading algorithms as
open-source software via Python Package Index for future research.

1 INTRODUCTION
The market cap of cryptocurrency or crypto tokens 1 has steadily in-
creased from nearly zero to more than $1 trillion 2 in the last decade
[36–39]. In addition, institutional and private investors are adding
cryptocurrency to their portfolios, and retailers are increasingly
accepting cryptocurrency for payment. As most cryptocurrencies
have very volatile prices, it would be intriguing to investigate the
fundamentals of a cryptocurrency to determine an optimal indicator
that reflects its market valuation relative to its fundamentals—that
is, is the cryptocurrency overvalued or undervalued? Currently, the
existing literature is far from identifying a reliable proxy for token
fundamentals.

Drawing on classic monetary theory, we first propose a new
market-to-fundamental ratio, which we call the price-to-utility
(PU) ratio, utilizing factors specific to cryptocurrency markets. As
cryptocurrency is one type of digital currency, we refer to the canon-
ical monetary economics as a theoretical foundation to pin down

the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies. More specifically, we con-
struct fundamental proxies considering three major currency func-
tions: medium-of-exchange, store-of-value, and unit-of-account for
cryptocurrencies. Innovatively, we proxy store-of-value by staking
ratios, available for the sake of the unique unspent transaction
outputs (UTXO) accounting on the Bitcoin Blockchain [46]. Then,
we construct proxies for a variety of fundamental-to-market ratios
using bitcoin (BTC) historical data. We find that, different from
the stock market, the fundamental-to-market ratios have little pre-
dictive power on short-term BTC returns, consistent with existing
literature. However, PU ratio, together with several other ratios
approximating user adoption to fundamentals [17], effectively pre-
dicts long-term BTC returns.

Effective valuation ratio can thus inform investment strategies: to
buy (sell) when the asset is undervalued (overvalued). Theoretically,
when the market-to-fundamentals ratio is high (low), the asset is
overvalued (undervalued). We use unsupervised and supervised
machine learning to verify that the PU ratio has explainability
for future returns. We found that buying low and selling high
based on PU ratio valuation are associated with higher investment
returns than other strategies. Moreover, when PU ratio falls below
an identifiable threshold, it effectively predicts bull markets ahead.
Finally, we propose an automated trading strategy guided by PU
ratio and find that it outperforms conventional buy-and-hold and
market-timing strategies.

1.1 Related Literature
Figure 1 illustrates how our approach contributes to the literature.
Our research adds to the literature on finding BTC price predictors.
Some of the literature provides partial evidence for the validity
of our indicators by relating BTC prices to a proxy for one of
the monetary functions. For instance, Biais et al. (2018) [9] pro-
vide an overlapping generation equilibrium model and emphasize
BTC’s role as a medium of exchange. By using a dynamic asset
pricing model, Cong, Li, and Wang (2021) [17] derive the value of
platform tokens by aggregating heterogeneous users’ demand for
cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. Alabi (2017, 2020) [2, 3]
and Wheatley et al. (2019) [63] use Metcalfe’s law [51] to measure
the fundamental value of Bitcoin. Metcalfe’s law stipulates that the
value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its
active users. While this law captures the value of a given token as a
medium of exchange by measuring the number of its active users, it
ignores the relatively inactive users who hold cryptocurrencies as
a store of value. Athey et al. (2016) [8] document how trading vol-
ume, another proxy for the medium of exchange, affects the token
price. Their results also provide evidence that BTC is mostly used
as a store of value, which underscores the necessity of considering

 
 
 
 
 
 
stores of value in BTC valuations. Additionally, current literature
has found other predictors of BTC prices, such as attractiveness
and popularity on social media,3 which are not directly related to
the fundamentals considered in our research.4

Our research also contributes to the emerging literature that ap-
plies machine learning to economics in a variety of fields to improve
prediction and inform decisions (e.g., Athey 2017, 2019 [4, 5]; Athey
and Imbens 2017, 2019 [6, 7]; Mullainathan and Spiess 2017 [53]).
Machine learning techniques are shown to constitute a powerful
analytical tool for big data and are effective in modeling complex
relationships (see Varian 2014 [62]). Among these techniques, the
most relevant to our research are those that can be applied to return
predictions in the stock market. For instance, Gu, Kelly, and Xiu
(2020) [33] report evidence on significant returns to investments
using machine learning predictions that in some cases offer twice
the performance of leading regression-based strategies. Gu, Kelly,
and Xiu (2021) [34] developed an autoencoder asset pricing model
that first applies advanced unsupervised machine learning methods
in finance and delivers much lower out-of-sample pricing errors
than traditional factor models. Our research differs from the pre-
ceding studies by applying machine learning to the valuation of
cryptocurrency; that is, the previous research uses machine learn-
ing to advance asset pricing in the stock markets, while ours uses
machine learning to pioneer asset pricing in the cryptocurrency
market. Moreover, existing literature in general uses supervised
machine learning methods in asset pricing, while ours shows how
unsupervised machine learning can also inform economics.

Furthermore, by integrating economic theory into machine learn-
ing, our research joins the emerging literature in explainable artifi-
cial intelligence (XAI) (e.g., Gunning 2019 [35]; Adadi and Berrada
2018) [1].5 XAI critiqued the application of machine learning to
predictions and decision-making and described it as a black box
that is not understandable by human experts and not perceived as
trustworthy by stakeholders. Our study provides three solutions.
First, we check the consistency in the economic intuition and algo-
rithm results. For instance, we verify that the function of our simple
indicator to inform a “buy-low and sell-high” strategy is, in theory,
aligned with the unsupervised machine learning analysis of the
BTC data. Second, using one supervised machine learning method
with high explainability, we show that the simple indicator alone is
efficient in predicting bull markets. Third, we propose an efficient
automated trading strategy with high interpretability based on the

3In exploring the impact of social media on bitcoin price, Mai et al. (2018) [48] and
Georgoula et al. (2015) [29] find that bullish forum sentiment is positively correlated
with the price of bitcoin futures, while Polasik et al. (2015) [55] find in an empirical
study of Bitcoin’s payment and investment functions that bitcoin price is mainly driven
by its popularity on social media. Ciaian, Rajcaniova, and Kancs (2015) [16] find that
the main drivers of the bitcoin price are the market forces of the bitcoin supply and
demand and the attractiveness of Bitcoin for investors and users. Liu and Tsyvinski
(2021) [46] show that high investor attention, as indicated by factors such as increased
Google searches, predicts high future returns over 1- to 2-week horizons for BTC.
Borri (2019) [11] finds that cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with each other, but
poorly correlated with other global assets, including gold. Blau (2017) [10] identifies
that speculative trading does not contribute to the unprecedented rise and subsequent
crash in BTC prices.
4Fantazzini et al. (2016) [24], Fry and Cheah (2016) [26], Corbet, Lucey, and Yarovaya
(2018) [21], Fry (2018) [25], and references therein used methods developed for stock
markets to test bubbles in the cryptocurrency market. The fundamentals used are a
function of historical prices, which differs from our monetary theory approach.

management in finance.

simple indicator alone for further applications of automation in the
industry.

Finally, our study also contributes to the literature in finance
in comparing the passive investment strategy of buy-and-hold6
and the active investment strategy of market-timing7 (e.g., Malkiel
2003 [49]; Shilling 1992 [61]; Sharpe 1975 [58]). Existing literature
shows that a long-term buy-and-hold strategy tends to outperform
the market-timing strategy. Since much of the market’s greatest
returns or declines are concentrated in a short time frame, the
market-timing strategy often makes use of high-frequency trading
technology with tens of thousands of trades per second. However,
trading directly on the Bitcoin network is very slow. Depending on
the network congestion, the finality time usually lasts one hour or
longer. Trading on exchanges involves high trading fees (e.g., the
largest crypto exchange Binance charges 0.1% trading fee) and third-
party risk (e.g., deposit hacking, exchange bankruptcy, and internal
manipulation by the insiders). Our automated trading strategy in-
volves as few trades as possible, while achieving higher returns than
the conventional buy-and-hold strategy. Moreover, other underly-
ing disadvantages of market-timing strategies such as maintenance,
labor cost, and the opportunity cost of daily attention are also less
of a concern in our trading strategy. To elaborate further, since
our approach is an automated trading strategy, it can be delegated
to decentralized exchanges (DEXs).8 A DEX is publicly verifiable
and transparent computer code that executes orders automatically
when conditions are satisfied. Therefore, users could connect their
wallets to a DEX and set their trading strategies in advance.

6Buy-and-hold is an investment strategy in which the investor may use an active
strategy to select securities or funds but then lock them in to hold them for a long
term.
7Market-timing is an investment strategy in which a market participant attempts to
beat the market by predicting its movements and buying and selling accordingly.
8DEX is a smart contract. Smart contracts are computer codes that can be automatically
executed when certain conditions are fulfilled. A smart contract does not need a
centralized entity to maintain its functions. Once deployed, it can run timely and
objectively, as long as the underlying platform, such as Ethereum, is secure and
decentralized.

1.2 The Data and Basic Characteristics
Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency9 and has the largest market
share.10 Thus, in this article, we construct and evaluate valuation
proxies using bitcoin historical data.11 The data are sampled daily
and downloaded from three open source platforms: CoinMetrics
(CM),12 the Coin MarketCap (CMC),13 and Google Bigquery.14 We
include the historical data on CM from January 3, 2009, to December
31, 2020, and on CMC from April 29, 2013, to December 31, 2020,
since April 29, 2013, is the first date that BTC has the off-chain
transactions recorded by CMC. The data from Bigquery are from
January 3, 2009, to August 31, 2020. The total volume we used in this
research is the sum of the on-chain exchange volume collected from
CM and the off-chain exchange volume from CMC. See Appendix
B for an introduction to the on-chain and off-chain transactions.
See Appendix A for the detailed Meta-Data information.

We now document the main statistical properties of the time
series for the BTC returns. Figure 2 shows the return distributions
of BTC at daily, weekly, and 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 360-day
frequencies. Table 1 shows the statistics of the BTC returns com-
parable to Table 1 in Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) [45]. Panel A shows
the mean, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and kurtosis of BTC
return at various frequencies and the percentage of positive returns.
The skewness is positive at all frequencies except for daily returns.
Panel B shows that the BTC market is highly volatile. The probabil-
ity of a 5% drop in a day is more than 7% and 2% for a 10% daily
loss. However, the probability of a positive movement is larger than
a negative movement of the same level.

2 CRYPTOCURRENCY VALUATION RATIOS
In Section 2.1 we present the existing cryptocurrency valuation
ratios in both academic literature and industry practice. Section 2.2
introduces the PU ratio and its implications. Section 2.3 assesses
the predictive power of various fundamental-to-market ratios on
future BTC returns.

2.1 Industry Cryptocurrency Valuation Ratios
An optimal valuation ratio should reflect the position of the market
valuation of the cryptocurrency relative to its fundamentals. When
the fundamental-to-market value is high/low, then the asset is un-
dervalued/overvalued. The market valuation of a cryptocurrency
can be precisely measured by its market cap. However, the funda-
mentals are difficult to determine. Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) [45]

Block Rewards

construct proxies for the fundamental-to-market ratio in the cryp-
tocurrency market. Among these proxies, the (negative) past 100-
week cumulative return (Past100) is based on a strong correlation
between the fundamental-to-market value and the negative of the
cumulative past returns [22, 22, 23, 52]. The other set of measures,
including the user-to-market ratio (UMR), the address-to-market ra-
tio (AMR), the transaction-to-market ratio (TMR), and the payment-
to-market ratio (PMR), are inspired by the dynamic cryptocurrency
asset pricing model developed in Cong, Li, and Wang (2021) [17]
and proxy fundamentals by user adoptions. Below, we review other
cryptocurrency valuation ratios adopted in industry practice in-
cluding price-to-earning (PE) ratio, network-value-to-transactions
(NVT) ratio, and price to Metcalfe’s (PM) ratio, and discuss their
pros and cons.15

2.1.1 Price-to-Earning (PE) ratio. Earnings per share is a widely
used proxy for the fundamentals of a company’s stock by financial
practitioners. Dividing the stock price by its earnings per share
yields the well-known PE ratio (Shiller 2000) [60]. Usually, a high PE
ratio indicates overvaluation of the stock, and a low ratio indicates
undervaluation. Similarly, one could use miners’ earnings as the
proxy of the token fundamentals. Miners’ earnings consist of the
block rewards and transaction fees paid by users as presented in Fig-
ure 3. However, using transaction fees and block rewards to proxy
for fundamentals is misleading because these fees are earned by
block makers (i.e., miners) and not by token holders. Furthermore,
using transaction fees could lead to ludicrous results. For example,
a low P/E ratio, resulting from a hike of transaction fees, implies
an undervaluation of the token. However, in contrast, it is intuitive
that high transaction fees usually impede a more universal adoption
of cryptocurrencies and indicate an overvaluation of tokens instead.
Figure 4 shows that the BTC PE ratio does not inform either BTC
valuation or price movement. The BTC price moves up and down,

15Note that those are market-to-fundamental ratios and the inverse of those are
fundamental-to-market ratios.

while the PE ratio increases quasi-linearly with three abrupt jumps.
The PE ratio is not a good indicator for assessing BTC valuation.16

2.1.2 Network-Value-to-Transactions (NVT) ratio. NVT ratio was in-
troduced by Willy Woo, an industry pioneer of on-chain analysis.17
It is defined as the ratio of the market value to token transaction
volume in USD over the past 24 hours. That is, the fundamental
value of a token derives from how frequently it is used for trans-
actions (i.e., from its function as a medium of exchange). A high
NVT ratio indicates that the market cap of the token outpaces the
transacted value on its blockchain, indicating speculation. A low
NVT ratio caused by an increasing transaction volume indicates a
relatively high usage of the token, which, in turn, serves as a signal
to buy the undervalued token. The limitation of the NVT ratio lies
in the assumption that the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency
derives only from its function as a medium of exchange. The usage
of cryptocurrencies as a store of value is completely overlooked
in this model. To illustrate the point, an increase of the NVT ratio
due to a reduction of the transaction volume does not necessarily
imply an overvaluation of the token. It could also be the result of
an increasing number of long-term holders hoarding more tokens,
thus causing a decline in transaction volume. In other words, the
NVT ratio offers a glimpse of what is happening, but it is not com-
pletely informative regarding buying and selling decisions. This
explains why the NVT ratio only captures short-term noises and
is not indicative of the general pattern of BTC price movement
(Figure 5).

2.1.3 Price to Metcalfe’s (PM) ratio: In the 1980s, Robert Metcalfe,
the inventor of Ethernet, proposed that the value of a network is
proportional to the square of the number of its users [57]. The
underlying logic of this proposal is that the number of connections
of a network with n nodes is 𝑛 (𝑛−1)
, which is asymptotically pro-
2
portional to 𝑛2. Since its inception, Metcalfe’s law has become an
influential tool for studying network effects. Figure 6 represents the

16BTC supply increases steadily while the block rewards are halved every four years,
which explains the quasi-linear growth of the BTC P/E ratio and the three jumps on
the halving dates.

PM ratio counting the number of active addresses as n. Compared
with PE ratio and NVT ratio, PM ratio has a better potential as a
valuation indicator for cryptocurrencies. However, it treats users
with different amounts of tokens indifferently and overlooks the
inactive users who hoard cryptocurrencies as a store of value.

2.2 Price-to-Utility Ratio
A comprehensive assessment of the fundamentals of a cryptocur-
rency should incorporate all the utilities it provides as a currency,
namely, medium of exchange, store of value,18 and unit of account.
In this section, we propose the price-to-utility (PU) ratio that con-
sists of proxies for all three utilities. We define Token Utility (TU)
and their proxies as in Equation (1):

𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 × 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜
𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 × 𝑑𝑖𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒

(1)

18In this article, “store of value” refers to the function of a token to keep or increase
its purchasing power over time.

5

Figure 8: The Percentage of Staked BTC at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10
Years

Figure 7 presents the mapping between proxies and BTC utilities.
Token velocity serves as the proxy for the medium of exchange. It
measures the percentage of tokens transacted over the past 24 hours
relative to the total token supply. A large token velocity signifies
frequent usage of and demand for the token.

The Staking ratio is a proxy for the store of value and it is defined
as the percentage of tokens that are older than one year in age. As
shown in Figure 8, a substantial amount of BTC tokens are inactive
for more than a year. These tokens serve as a store of value and
can be referred to as “staked tokens.” A high staking ratio implies
that more users are placing long-term faith in the Bitcoin system.
Figure 8 shows the BTC staking ratio has been steadily increasing
with periodic booms and busts.

In a nutshell, token velocity represents the utility of the token in
its role as a medium of exchange that is demanded by daily active
users; while the staking ratio represents the utility of the token
as a store of value, demanded by long-term holders. The inverse
of the dilution rate is another proxy for the store of value. The
dilution rate measures the annual growth rate of the token supply.
The new BTC comes from the block rewards. Ceteris paribus, a
high dilution rate makes the token less attractive as a store of value,

Yulin Liu and Luyao Zhang

Figure 9: Annualized BTC Dilution Rate

Figure 11: The BTC Price in USD (Blue Line) and Token Util-
ity (Green Line)

driven by the steady growth of the token staking ratio (see Figure
8) and token velocity. The BTC price growth can be justified by the
increase of its fundamentals (i.e., its token utility). Nevertheless,
there are periods of deviations in the BTC price from its token utility,
which typically indicates either overvaluation or undervaluation.
Dividing BTC price by its utility yields the PU ratio of BTC
(Figure 12). Bitcoin’s first halving event in November 2012 broke
the BTC supply-demand equilibrium and led to a price hike from
around $10 to $100 in the first half of 2013. The BTC price soared
from around $100 in September 2013 to $1,100 within a couple of
months. Such a sharp price spike lured the long-term holders to
sell their staked BTC (see the drop of BTC staking ratio in Figure
8). Correspondingly, the BTC token utility also plunged. The price
hysteria, together with the significant drop of the token utility,
drove the PU ratio to unsustainably high levels at the end of 2013,
indicating overvaluation of the BTC. Figure 12 shows that the BTC
price experienced a whole year drop from above $1,000 to around
$200 in 2014. From the beginning of 2015 to the mid-2016, the BTC
price steadily increased from $200 to around $500 along with a firm
growth of the BTC token utility (Figure 11), rendering a relatively
stable PU ratio in the undervaluation range. The BTC price hike in
this period can be justified by the increase of its fundamentals—a
moderate increase of BTC velocity and staking ratio.

After the second halving event in July 2016, the BTC dilution
rate dropped to around 4%. The formation of the new BTC supply-
demand equilibrium led to the instability of the PU ratio between
mid-2016 and mid-2017. The BTC price reached a historically high
$3,000 in June 2017. Long-term holders started to sell their BTC,
leading to a drop in the BTC staking ratio in the second half of
2017. Meanwhile, the BTC velocity experienced a moderate drop.
These two factors led to the drop of token utility. However, the BTC
price rapidly grew to $20,000. The drop in BTC token utility and
skyrocketing BTC price resulted in the sharp spike of the Bitcoin
PU ratio at the end of 2017. It took a whole year for the price
to consolidate at around $6,000 in 2018. The price even plunged
to $3,100 in early 2019, which was dubbed “crypto winter.” Since

Figure 10: The BTC Volatility at 30, 60, 90, and 180 Days

thus leading to a lower token utility. Figure 9 demonstrates that
the dilution rate of BTC has significantly decreased over the last
decade.19 The inverse of price volatility20 is the proxy for the unit of
account. Figure 10 shows the volatility of BTC at 30, 60, 90, and 180
days. Note that due to the high volatility of the token price, most
cryptocurrencies, except for stable coins (see Senner and Sornette
2018) or coins with high stabilities [30],21 are limited in their utility
as a unit of account. For simplicity, we will keep the price volatility
mute in the following illustration of PU ratio; however, we include
it in the robustness check in the machine learning session.22

Figure 11 illustrates the BTC token utility has been increasing in
tandem with the BTC price. The growth of the BTC utility is mainly

Note: Red zone (PU >100) indicates overvaluation, yellow
zone (60 < PU < 100) indicates a normal range, and green zone
(PU <60) indicates undervaluation.

March 2019, an increase in token utility resulted from the rise of
the token velocity and the staking ratio, along with the decrease
of the dilution rate. Increasing demand boosted the BTC price to
around $15,000 in the summer of 2019, which signifies the end of
the bearish crypto winter. The BTC price hovered around $10,000
over the next year and achieved a new all-time high of $30,000 at
the end of 2020. The PU ratio once again poked into the yellow
zone, which indicates a slight overvaluation of the BTC price.

PREDICTIVE POWER ON FUTURE
RETURNS

In this section we document the predictive regressions of BTC
future 1-week, 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 360-day returns on
proxies for BTC fundamental-to-market ratio. The proxies for the
BTC valuation ratio include the inverse of the PE ratio (EPR), the
inverse of the NVT ratio (TVN), the inverse of the P/M ratio (MPR),
and the inverse of the PU ratio (UPR). To make a comparison with
the results reported by Liu and Tsyvinski (2021), we also include the
(negative) past 100−week cumulative BTC returns (Past100), the
AMR,23 the TMR,24 PMR,25 and the first principal component of the
previous eight proxies (FPC). In Panel A of Table 2, we report the
correlations across the different valuation ratios at daily frequency
in the cryptocurrency market. The measures are not necessarily
highly correlated with one another, with correlations ranging from
−0.65 to 0.98.

We regress the BTC returns on the lagged cryptocurrency funda-
mental to market ratios, and the results are reported in Panel B of
Table 2. Our regression differs from Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) [45] in

23The number of active addresses to market cap.
24The number of transaction counts to market cap.
25The number of payments (transfers) to market cap.

three aspects. First, we add four more fundamental-to-market ratios:
EPR, TVN, MPR, and UPR. Second, we test the predictive power
on long-horizon returns up to 360 days while Liu and Tsyvinski
(2021) [45] only test for up to 8 weeks. Third, our ratios are at
daily frequencies while theirs are at weekly frequencies. We have
new findings aside from those consistent with existing literature.
First of all, none of these ratios has enough predictive power on
future BTC returns in the short run (i.e., 1-week and 30-day return
on investment (ROI)26 ), which supports the finding in Liu and
Tsyvinski (2021) [45]. Second, AMR, PMR, TMP, and UPR together
provide a good prediction of future BTC returns at a longer scale
and the predictive power increases with longer horizons. Third,
UPR best predicts long-term returns at 90-day, 180-day, and 360-
day horizons. The latter two new findings lead to a supplementary
conclusion from Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) [45]. We can conclude
that there is a strong relationship between the future BTC returns
and several fundamental-to-value ratios, especially the reverse of
the PU ratio, at a longer horizon.

4 CRYPTOCURRENCY VALUATION:

EXPLAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING

An asset is overvalued (undervalued) when the ratio of the mar-
ket cap to its fundamentals is high (low). The ratio is then useful
in informing investors to follow the golden rule—“buy low and
sell high.” In this section, we design machine learning methods to
further assess the explainability of the PU ratio in asset valuation.
We utilize K-means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning
method in Section 3.1, and Decision Tree Classifier, a supervised
machine learning method in Section 3.2.

26In Table 2 Panel B, we can see that the R squared values in the first two columns are
all below 6%.

Notes: This table reports the predictive regressions of BTC
future 1-day, 1-week, 30-day, 90-day, 180-day, and 360-day re-
turns on proxies for BTC fundamental-to-market ratio. The
proxies for BTC valuation ratio include the (negative) past
100-week cumulative BTC returns, the address-to-market
ratio, the transaction-to-market ratio, payment-to-market
ratio, the inverse of PE ratio (EPR), the inverse of NVT ratio
(TVN), the inverse of PM ratio (MPR), the inverse of PU ratio
(UPR), and the first principal component (FPC) of the previ-
ous eight proxies. The Newey-West adjusted t-statistics with
𝑛 −1 lags are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote sig-
nificance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels. The data frequency is
daily.

4.1 Unsupervised Machine Learning
In this section, we use K-means Clustering [47], an unsupervised
machine learning method to test the explainability of the PU ratio
and alternative indicators. We identify a pattern: A high ROI is
associated with a strategy of buying when the PU ratio is low and
selling when the PU ratio is high, which is consistent with the
theoretical implication of the PU ratio. We fail to identify similar
patterns for the NVT and PM ratios.

4.1.1 K-means Clustering. K-means clustering aims to partition n
observations to k clusters in which each observation belongs to
the cluster with the nearest cluster centroid. Specifically, given a
data set 𝑥 (1), 𝑥 (2), ..., 𝑥 (𝑚) , our goal is to predict 𝑘 centroids and a
label 𝑐 (𝑖) for each data point, such that each cluster centroid’s 𝜇𝑘
is the closest to all data points with label 𝑐 (𝑖) = 𝑘. The algorithm
proceeds as in Algorithm 1.

The algorithm finally finds the best centroids and labels by al-
ternating between (1) labeling data points in clusters based on
the current centroids and (2) choosing centroids based on current
cluster labels.

Yulin Liu and Luyao Zhang

ALGORITHM 1: K-means Clustering
Initialize cluster centroids 𝜇1,𝜇2,...,𝜇𝑘 ∈ 𝑅𝑛 randomly;
while not converge do

for every 𝑖, set 𝑐 (𝑖) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑗 ||𝑥 (𝑖) − 𝜇 𝑗 ||2;
(cid:205)𝑚
for every 𝑗, set 𝜇 𝑗 =
𝑖=1
(cid:205)𝑚
𝑖=1

𝐼 [𝑐 (𝑖 ) =𝑗 ]𝑥 (𝑖 )
𝐼 [𝑐 (𝑖 ) =𝑗 ]

.

end

4.1.2 Method and Result. We represent each N-day investment by
its PU ratios at buy-in and sell-out date:

𝑥 (𝑖) = (𝑃𝑈 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑏𝑢𝑦−𝑖𝑛 − 𝑃𝑈 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑙−𝑜𝑢𝑡 )
Then we label the data in four clusters. The indicator’s theoretical
implication is deemed consistent with empirical data if the following
two criteria are satisfied:

(2)

(1) There exists a cluster 𝑘∗ such that the PU ratio at the buy-in
date is low and the PU ratio at the sell-out date is high; that
is, for the centroid 𝜇𝑘 ∗ of cluster 𝑘∗, the map of 𝜇𝑘 ∗ on the
x-axis is larger than that on the y-axis: 𝜇𝑘 ∗ |𝑥 < 𝜇𝑘 ∗ |𝑦.
(2) The investments in cluster 𝑘∗ have a higher ROI than invest-

ments in other clusters.

Our results show that only the PU ratio satisfies the two cri-
teria. We elaborate the analyses for 90-day investment and show
robustness in Appendix C.2 and C.3 for investments with shorter
or longer durations and when considering volatility.

Figure 13 displays the result of K-Means Clustering for the PU
Ratio. The x-axis represents the PU ratio on the buy-in date and
the y-axis represents the PU ratio on the sell-out date. Figure 14
shows the ROI by labeled clusters. Cluster 1 in green manifests
a pattern of buy-low (highest PU ratio on buy date: 117.39) and
sell-high (lowest PU ratio after 90 days: 257.47) and the mean of its
ROI dominates the three other clusters.

Figures 15 and 16 show the results for the NVT ratio. However,
no pattern such as that seen in Figures 13 and 14 can be found.
The cluster in green with the highest ROI has, in general, a higher
NVT ratio on both the buy-in and the sell-out days. Figures 17
and 18 show the results for the PM ratio. No explainable pattern
can be found in these figures either. There is not even a category
generating significantly higher ROI.

4.2 Supervised Machine Learning
In this section, we use Decision Tree Classifier [12], a supervised
machine learning model with high explainability [35] to further
explore the explainability of the PU ratio. A PU ratio below an
identifiable threshold effectively predicts a bull market. The finding
is consistent with the theoretical implication that a low PU ratio
implies an undervaluation, which predicts future market rebounds.

4.2.1 Decision Tree Classifier. Decision Tree Classifier aims to re-
cursively split the dataset into targeting labeled classes according
to relevant features such that the observed labels are as pure as pos-
sible (majority to be only 1 or 0) for the resulting sub-datasets after
splits. Each split is represented by a node and the splitting criteria
are denoted along a branch of the tree. The algorithm proceeds as
in Algorithm 2.

Entropy and Gini are two criteria for calculating information
gains. A sub-dataset with multiple observed labels is impure, whereas
the one with only one label is pure. Let 𝑝 (𝑐𝑖 )denote the percent-
age/probability of observed label 𝑐𝑖 in a (sub) dataset, and the for-
mulas for Entropy and Gini are:

Figure 16: 90-Day ROI by Clustering Categories (NVT Ratio)

ALGORITHM 2: Decision Tree Classifier
1. Pick a criterion to evaluate information gain, e.g. 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦

or 𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖;
2. Pick targeting labels and relevant features;

while not converge do

a. find a descriptive feature such that the optimal split
along this feature achieves the highest information
gain;

b. split the dataset along the descriptive feature using

the optimal split.

end

Information gain for each split is the difference in Entropy (Gini)
before and after the split. The Entropy (Gini) after each split is the

weighted Entropies (Ginis) of resulting sub-datasets, where weights
are the percentage of observations.

Investments (Criterion=Entropy, Maximum Depth = 1)

Note: Each note in the figure includes: (1) the criteria for
splitting; (2) entropy for the sub-datasets; (3) sample size; (4)
the sample size for the bull market or not; and (5) the class
label. For example, in the root note, the criterion for split-
ting is whether the PU ratio at the buy-in date is smaller
than 36.434. The training dataset has 2663 observations with
1,877 bull market labels.

thus promising to generate high returns. More specifically, the result
suggests a cutoff strategy of buying when the PU ratio is smaller
than 36.434, which will very likely generate a return of over 20% in
180 days. The result is robust when we change the criterion for the
quality of splits to Gini and the duration of investments. However,
the precision of the prediction decreases for shorter periods of
investments, indicating that the PU ratio is an indicator that serves
long-term investments better (See Appendix C.4).

5 AUTOMATED TRADING STRATEGIES
In this section, we propose an automated trading strategy based
on the PU ratio and compare its performance to a conventional
buy-and-hold strategy and a moving average (MA) crossover rule
in finance29. We find that the strategy based on the PU ratio out-
performs the other two conventional strategies.

5.1 Method
Our strategy generates a buy (sell) signal when the PU ratio is equal
to or lower (higher) than its 0.1 (0.9) quantiles of the past records.
The MA crossover rule generates a buy (sell) signal when the short-
window MA of BTC price crosses up (down) its long-window MA.
Finally, the buy-and-hold strategy buys at the start date and holds
until the end date of the investment period.

29The moving average rules (Gartley 1935 [27]) give a buy (sell) signal when the
short-window moving average of the current price indicator moves above (below)
its long-window moving average. Literature in finance (e.g., Brown and Jennings
1989 [14]; Brock, Lakonishok, and Lebaron 1992 [13], Neely et al. 2014 [54]) show
evidence that investors benefit more by following the moving average rules than
the buy-and-hold strategies. The intuition is that the moving average rules predict a
short-term positive fluctuation in price when its short-term indicator moves above
(below) its long-term indicator.

Figure 17: PM Ratio Clustering (90-Day ROI)

Figure 18: 90-Day ROI by Clustering Categories (PM Ratio)

4.2.2 Method and Result. To further test the consistency of the PU
ratio, we predict the bull market with the PU ratio at the buy-in
date: 𝐼 [𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡] ∼ 𝑓 (𝑃𝑈 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜). We adopt the most common
definition of a bull market: when the ROI for investment is larger
than 20%27. We split the earlier 75% data to train the model and
use the rest for testing. Figure 19 represents a model achieving an
accuracy of 0.96 when controlling for a maximum depth of 2 and
using entropy as the criterion for information gain28. The result
shows a significant bull market prediction when the PU ratio is
smaller than 36.434. The results are consistent with the economic
intuition: When the PU ratio is low, the asset is undervalued and

28The results are robust across different random states and the current random state
is zero. We restrict the maximum depth for illustration simplicity.

5.2 Result
We evaluate the performance of the three strategies with an initial
capital of 100,000 USD, a 0.1% transaction fee, and a transaction
limit of 100 BTC at each buy or sell signal.30 We consider the
timeframe from the first date of the BTC off-chain transaction on
December 27, 2013, to December 31, 2020. Figures 20-22 show the
buy and sell points for the three strategies. Figures 23-25 show the
value of cash, (BTC) holdings, and total asset time series in USD for
each strategy. At the end of the trading day, the automated trading
strategy based on the PU ratio generates a gross ROI of 6,245.83%
and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.65, which is higher than both
the market timing strategy based on the MA crossover rule (gross
ROI: 2,670.37%; annualized Sharpe ratio: 3.29) and the buy-and-hold
strategy (gross ROI: 3,920.09%; annualized Sharpe ratio: 2.87). The
result is robust in a variety of parameter settings and even better
when we do not set a transaction limit. (see Appendix C.5). Figures
26-28 further represent the gross ROI and annualized Sharpe ratio
time series.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Our results imply that considering features unique to the crypto
market could contribute significantly to cryptocurrency valuation.
For instance, in this study, we take advantage of Blockchain UTXO

Yulin Liu and Luyao Zhang

Like all other asset prices, cryptocurrency prices are also affected
by macroeconomics development, which is beyond the scope of this
paper. For example, on March 12, 2020, the cryptocurrency market
crashed with the stock market and gold market due to the panic
sale caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin prices plunged
more than 60%, almost twice as much as the stock market (e.g., Dow
Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index). However, one and half
months after the market collapse, the BTC price quickly recovered
to its pre-crisis level while the stock market still stagnated at around
80% of its pre-crisis level. It would be interesting to study what
unique attributes of the cryptocurrency market led to the different
market trajectories and what the implications are for investment
strategies.

In the current paper, the indicators that we develop for cryp-
tocurrency valuation are based on macro variables and functions
of currency in monetary theory. However, every macro phenom-
enon is a manifestation of micro behavior in an aggregate form,
which in general is derived from two micro facets: the choices
of each individual based respectively on rationality or heuristic
bias contingent on the state of the world. For the first, to model
rational choices, each individual must envision at least all hypo-
thetical scenarios in Decision under Ambiguity [43] and also form
subjective probabilities for all possible scenarios in Decision un-
der Uncertainty [32]. However, since crypto economics is rapidly
evolving, both requirements are difficult if not far-fetched for the
majority, which makes the problems more similar to decision under
ignorance [31, 42, 44, 50], a vastly uncultivated field even at the
foundations of microeconomic theory. For the second, little litera-
ture seeks to understand behavioral patterns of bounded rationality.
For instance, Gemayel and Preda (2021) [28] find evidence of heuris-
tic bias including disposition effect [59], self-attribution bias [41],
and the gambler’s fallacy [15] among cryptocurrency traders. We
envision the two directions as representing promising directions
and the next frontiers for future research.

Hey (2009) [40] envisions the fourth paradigm shift in scien-
tific discoveries to be data driven. Our study shows that interdisci-
plinary research in machine learning could verify the explainability
of valuation ratios by establishing consistency for its theoretical
implications in empirical results. To facilitate this future research,
we distribute the trading algorithms as open-source software via
Python Package Index [1] (PyPI).39

accounting methods to construct a proxy for store-of-value. This ap-
proach could be seamlessly applied to other UTXO blockchains such
as Bitcoin Cash,31 Dash,32 Dogecoin,33 Litecoin,34 and Zcash.35
Moreover, our approach can adapt to the updates of blockchain
mechanisms and generate further research findings. In recent years,
cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work have been criticized as
a waste of energy. Most of the electricity consumed by miners is
converted into hashing power to compute cryptographic puzzles
instead of routing and executing transactions. To address this issue,
proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain projects, such as EOS,36 Tezos,37
and Cosmos,38 have gained momentum in recent years. In the PoS
protocol, a certain fraction of native tokens is staked in the system
by validators (i.e., miners, see Saleh 2020 [56]) . Validators do not
need to solve the cryptographic puzzles to win the block rewards.
The more tokens staked by a validator, the higher the chance that
the validator becomes a block maker and earns the block rewards.
Moreover, PoS projects have a flexible token dilution rate. For exam-
ple, the dilution rate is dynamically adjusted by the Cosmos system
to achieve a 66.7% staking ratio. When the staking ratio drops be-
low the target, the block rewards automatically increase to attract
more tokens staked in the system and vice versa. In such a case,
the staking ratio and the dilution rate as proxies for store-of-value
would be interdependent. It would be interesting to explore further
in this direction.
