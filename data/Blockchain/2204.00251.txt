Abstract:  Decentralized  Finance  (DeFi)  is  a  nascent  set  of  financial  services,  using  tokens,  smart  contracts,  and 
blockchain  technology as financial instruments. We investigate four  possible drivers of DeFi returns: exposure to 
cryptocurrency market, the network effect, the investor's attention, and the valuation ratio. As DeFi tokens are distinct 
from classical cryptocurrencies, we design a new dedicated market index, denoted DeFiX. First, we show that DeFi 
tokens returns are driven by the investor's attention on technical terms such as "decentralized finance" or "DeFi", 
and are exposed to their own network variables and cryptocurrency market. We construct a valuation ratio for the 
DeFi market by dividing the Total Value Locked (TVL) by the Market Capitalization (MC). Our findings do not support 
the TVL/MC predictive power assumption. Overall, our empirical study shows that the impact of the cryptocurrency 
market on DeFi returns is stronger than any other considered driver and provides superior explanatory power.

I.Introduction 
1.1. Context 
Blockchain  was  the  first  tool  to  bring  a  decentralized  alternative  to  the  existing  payment  instruments.  From  that 
moment on, Fintech and Blockchain technology spread over the whole finance industry and other areas by bringing 
more automation and innovative solutions. Decentralized finance (DeFi) brings the latest Blockchain-based distributed 
solutions  aiming to provide financial services  on a large scale,  without intermediaries, using automated protocols. 
DeFi  is  a  fast-growing  sub-sector  of  the  crypto-financial  market  (Corbet  et  al.,  2021;  Ramos  &  Zanko,  2021).  Its 
solutions  cover  most  functions  of  the  traditional  financial  system,  from  funds  transfer  to  margin  trading,  interest-
earning, and market-making. A more detailed description of the DeFi market is provided in appendix section A. 

1.2. Literature review 
Compared to the vast literature on cryptocurrencies, DeFi-related research is scarcer. Gudgeon et al. (2020) assess the 
interest rates, liquidity, and market efficiency of nowadays main DeFi projects. They find that DeFi tokens (abr. DeFis)  
are relatively inefficient, while the market is liquid mostly at times of high (platform) utilization. Zetzsche et al. (2020) 
analyze DeFi platforms’ potential, put in the context of the traditional financial  economy, and find that DeFis can 
erode the effectiveness of existing financial regulation. Maouchi et al. (2021) study the bubbles present in the NFT 
and DeFi markets and discover that COVID-19 and trading volume aggravate the bubble occurrences. They observe 
that DeFi prices’ dynamics are different from pure cryptocurrencies, which distinguishes them from the latter asset 
class. Moreover, they explain that the total value locked (abr. TVL1) should be used as a monitoring tool for the DeFi 
market (growth), as it indicates the fundamental value of DeFi protocols (Maouchi et al., 2021). Similarly, Corbet et 
al. (2021) tested for the existence of bubbles and found that DeFi bubbles are  mainly  self-generated and partially 
accelerated by ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC). At the same time, they test for a possible co-movement between DeFi 

1 TVL stands for Total Value Locked and refers to the amount of funds attached to a DeFi project.

tokens  and  cryptocurrencies,  which  revealed  that  DeFi  tokens  represent  a  separate  asset  class  with  some  links  to 
conventional cryptocurrencies. In another study, (Harwick & Caton, 2020) argue that while cryptocurrencies have the 
potential  to  perform  monetary  and  financial  functions  superior  to  those  of  national  currencies,  pure  decentralized 
autonomous finance remains an illusory idea as long as it will not integrate real-world identity. Karim et al.(2022) are 
the first to investigate the risk transmission among non-fungible tokens (NFTs), DeFis, and cryptocurrencies. They 
show that despite significant risk spillovers in the blockchain markets, namely among DeFis and cryptos, NFTs could 
greatly serve as an ‘investment shield’. A growing literature debates one of the main drawbacks of the DeFi market, 
which is a lack of regulation and legal compliance (Anker-Sørensen & Zetzsche, 2021; Aramonte et al., 2021; Chen 
& Bellavitis, 2019, 2020; Johnson, 2021; Popescu, 2020; Stepanova & Eriņš, 2021; Wronka, 2021).  

1.2. Motivation and research issue 
DeFi represents a sub-sector of the crypto-financial market (Corbet et al., 2021; Ramos & Zanko, 2021).  Motivated 
by (Corbet et al., 2021; Maouchi et al., 2021; Schär, 2021; Yousaf et al., 2022), who show that DeFi tokens are a 
distinct asset class compared to conventional cryptocurrencies, our goal is to offer a first analysis of the DeFi market 
and answer to the following research question: ‘What drives the DeFi returns?’. In their paper, Liu & Tsyvinski (2021) 
showed that the cryptocurrency market is exposed to the network effect (capturing the user adoption), the momentum 
effect,  and  the  investor  attention  but  is  not  impacted  by  the  cryptocurrencies’  production  factors,  macroeconomic 
factors, or other asset classes (e.g., commodities or stocks). Following their study, we thus investigate four possible 
drivers  of  DeFi  returns:  (1)  taking  into  account  that  both  cryptocurrencies  and  DeFi  tokens  run  on  Blockchain 
technology and belong to the crypto-market, we assess the cryptocurrencies’ return impact on DeFi returns; (2) the 
exposure to network variables to see if the DeFi market is as well exposed to the same factors as cryptocurrencies (Liu 
& Tsyvinski, 2021); (3) the investor’s attention plays an important role in asset pricing in both cryptocurrency and the 
stock  market,  therefore  it  seems  important  to  assess  its  impact  on  the  DeFi  market  as  well;  and  (4)  motivated  by 
relevant studies (Ball et al., 2020; Cong et al., 2021; Liu & Tsyvinski,  2021; Pontiff & Schall, 1998) tackling the 
valuation ratio importance in predicting future returns, we want to investigate if DeFi returns can be predicted by a 
ratio similar to the ‘book-to-market’. 

1.3. Main findings 
Being an asset class separate from conventional cryptocurrencies (Corbet et al., 2021; Maouchi et al., 2021), we cannot 
use the CRIX index as a proxy for the DeFi Market. Up to now2, the whole DeFi market has never been analyzed. 
Therefore, we contribute to this area of research and design a market index that will enable us to assess the performance 
of this new asset class and the market as a whole. We compute “DeFiX”, a value-weighted market index of all the 
DeFi  tokens.  We  use  the  CRIX’s  index  methodology  (‘an  index  for  Blockchain-based  currencies’)  (Trimborn  & 
Härdle,  2018)  and  a  version  of  its  original  code  to  construct  DeFiX,  a  novel  market  benchmark  for  decentralized 
finance.  

In  line  with  Corbet  et  al.  (2021)  and  Yousaf  &  Yarovaya  (2021),  our  empirical  analysis  confirms  that  the 
cryptocurrency market strongly influences DeFi returns. DeFi tokens appear to be exposed to their network variables, 
a  result  similar  to  (Liu  &  Tsyvinski,  2021)  for  the  cryptocurrency  market.  Our  findings  reveal  that  the  investor's 
attention drives DeFi returns on technical terms as "decentralized finance" or "DeFi". Furthermore, we investigated if 
DeFi returns can be predicted by their corresponding ‘book-to-market’ ratio. As there is no standard ‘book’ value for 
DeFi tokens, we construct a ratio by dividing the Total Value Locked (TVL) by the Market Capitalization (MC). Our 
findings do not support the TVL/MC predictive power assumption. Out of all the considered drivers, our empirical 
study shows that the impact of the cryptocurrency market on DeFi returns is the strongest. 

The  structure  of  this  paper  is  as  follows.  The  next  section  exposes  the  data  description  and  collection.  Section  3 
introduces the methodology used and data analysis performed, alongside the obtained results. Section 4 comprises the 
discussion and conclusion.

II.Data description and sources 

2.1. Financial data 
We access Coinmarketcap.com and spglobal.com platforms to collect financial data for our DeFi tokens as well as for 
bitcoin, ether coin, and CRIX index. We download the CRIX index prices from spglobal.com, for which the historical 
data starts from March 2018. Coinmarketcap is the leading source for financial crypto-related information and has 
been used as a reliable source by various researchers, including but not limited to (Borri, 2019; Fry & Cheah, 2016; 
Griffin & Shams, 2020; Grobys & Sapkota, 2019; Howell et al., 2020; Koutmos, 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Stosic et al., 
2018; S. Zhang et al., 2019). We extract financial data for 478 DeFi tokens, such as market capitalization, daily prices, 
and trading volume information. Globally, we have data from 2017 to 2022. 

2.2. DeFiX  
With the financial data extracted from Coinmarketcap, we construct a market index, DeFiX, as the value-weighted 
return of all underlying tokens. At this step, we are using all the tokens’ information, such as price, volume, and market 
capitalization.  Similar  to  Liu  &  Tsyvinski  (2021)’s  approach,  we  decided  to  remove  the  tokens  with  less  than 
1,000,000  USD  market  capitalization.  In  the  construction  of  DeFiX,  we  work  with  daily  close  prices  and  use  the 
methodology and original code for the CRIX index (Trimborn & Härdle, 2018). As its name states, CRIX is ‘an Index 
for Blockchain-based currencies’. Considering that cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens run on Blockchain technology 
and  belong  to  the  crypto-market,  we  chose  to  use  the  CRIX’s  index  methodology  and  original  code3  to  construct 
DeFiX. The earliest data for DeFi tokens starts from July 2014 and corresponds to the BitShares platform. After some 
data cleaning (removing the missing values) and processing, our proposed DeFiX index is composed of 95 tokens and 
spans from May 2017 to December 2021. A more detailed methodology for our index construction can be found in 
Appendix B. For other parts of the analysis, we compute as well the weekly and monthly market returns from the daily 
market returns. A detailed description of all the data used can be found in appendix section C. 

2.3. Network data  
The  literature  has  established  that  the  network  effect  makes  cryptocurrencies  more  useful as  more  people join  the 
network / Blockchain (Biais et al., 2020; Cong et al., 2021; Pagnotta & Buraschi, 2018). In other words, this means 
that the more individuals decide to use BTC, the more valuable the entire Bitcoin ecosystem becomes; hence the price 
will  increase.  Liu  &  Tsyvinski  (2021)  show  that  the  network  effect  is  one  of  the  cryptocurrencies’  price  drivers. 
Therefore, we assess if the same is valid for the DeFi market. We use three primary measures to proxy the network 
effect on the DeFi  market: the number of  wallet  users, the number of active  addresses, and the TVL4 (total value 
locked). Similar to (Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021), we retrieve data for the number of transactions and active addresses from 
Coinmetrics.io. We obtained information for 30 DeFi tokens, out of which we have financial data only for 21. TVL is 
a unique variable characteristic of the DeFi market. Then, Defillama.com is one of the most complete data aggregators 
collecting the TVL information for DeFi platforms and financial data for NFTs. We extract the TVL for 503 tokens 
from  Defillama.com,  out  of  which  we  have  financial  information  (price,  market  cap.  and  volume  from  the 
coinmarketcap.com) only for 160.  

2.4. Investor’s attention data  
Information is at the heart of financial markets and represents an essential element in asset pricing. Just like traditional 
markets, cryptocurrencies seem to be driven by investor attention as well (Lin, 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Liu & Tsyvinski, 
2021; Shen et al., 2019; W. Zhang & Wang, 2020). Therefore, we want to see if the DeFi market’s returns have the 
same driver. We measure the investor’s attention with google data (frequency weekly), which is downloaded from the 
search engine using specific keywords such as ‘Decentralized Finance’ and ‘DeFi’. For further information about data 
see appendix section C. 

The main statistical properties of the variables used in this study are shown in Table 1. 

3 From www.quantlet.de 
4 The total value locked refers to the amount of funds committed to a DeFi project. This value is often considered a measure for the platform’s 
success (Maouchi et al., 2021), while at the same time, it could be perceived as a partial substitute to the classical Book value.

This table summarizes the descriptive statistics of the main variables used. In panel A we show the statistical properties of the network variables. 
For our analyses, we will use as measures the address growth, transaction growth, and TVL growth (marked with ‘Δ’). The Durbin-Watson test 
shows that the growth variables have a lower negative (or positive) autocorrelation than the initial ones. Panel B reports the summary statistics 
for the two proxies used to measure investor’s attention: google searches for “Decentralized finance” and “DeFi”. 
 Panel C reports the summary statistics for DeFiX index, CRIX, bitcoin, and ether’s returns. Data spans from May 2017 to December 2021. 

Figure 1 plots the cumulative returns of the DeFiX compared to those of the two major cryptocurrencies and the CRIX 
index.  We  can  observe  a  strong  co-movement  among  the  bitcoin,  ether  coin,  and  the  DeFi  market  returns,  result 
confirmed as well by (Corbet et al., 2021). We can see as well that CRIX follows the same trend, confirming the strong 
co-movement between the cryptocurrency market and the DeFi market.

III.Methods and analysis  

In this section, we assess three possible drivers for DeFi tokens’ returns: the cryptocurrency market, the network effect, 
and the investor’s attention. Furthermore, making a parallel with stocks returns’ determinants, we introduce a ‘book-
to-market ratio’ specific to the DeFi market. We further check whether DeFi returns can be predicted by this variable. 

3.1 Exposure to the cryptocurrency market 

Co-movement among securities’ returns has always been an important aspect in asset pricing, risk management, and 
subsequently, asset allocation (Eraker et al., 2003; Oliva & Renò, 2018). Important research has been done on this 
matter,  concerning  both  the  traditional  and  cryptocurrency  markets.  Contrasting  with  the  early  literature,  several 
studies show that bitcoin is not a dominating coin anymore (Bouri, Shahzad, et al., 2019; Yi et al., 2018), while its 
strong and persistent influence remains (Bouri et al., 2020; Bouri, Gupta, et al., 2019; Ciaian et al., 2018; Ji et al., 
2019; Pereira & Ferreira, 2019; Stosic et al., 2018). Often, connectedness within the crypto-market is observed among 
the leading cryptocurrencies only, and it is stronger in the short run (Corbet et al., 2019; Yarovaya & Zięba, 2022).  

We investigate the predictive power of cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and CRIX index) for the DeFi market returns.  
For addressing such an issue, we begin by proposing a new index of the DeFi market, namely, the DeFiX index. We 
then analyze the impact of cryptocurrencies’ returns on the DeFiX index and on 15 of the leading DeFis5. The rationale 
behind our selection for BTC and ETH cryptocurrencies is the following: Ethereum is the main technology used in 
developing DeFi platforms (Popescu, 2020; Ramos & Zanko, 2021), while BTC and ETH are the main digital coins 
used as leverage in DeFi operations (Aramonte et al., 2021; Schär, 2021). CRIX is the index for the cryptocurrency 
market, and since the current literature (Corbet et al., 2021; Karim et al., 2022; Maouchi et al., 2021) shows an existing 
relationship between bitcoin and certain DeFi tokens, it seems relevant to assess whether the crypto-market as a whole 
has an impact on the DeFi market.  

Before  carrying  out  a  regression  analysis,  we  study  the  correlation  between  cryptocurrencies  and  DeFis.  Table  2 
reports a strong correlation between cryptocurrency and the DeFi market. To avoid possible multicollinearity issues, 
we thus further assess the exposure of the DeFi market to the cryptocurrency market by making individual checks 
instead of regressions with all the variables together.

3.1.1 The predictive power of bitcoin 

We begin the analysis of the DeFi exposure to the cryptocurrency market by first checking the power of influence of 
bitcoin. We regress the DeFiX index returns and the 15 main DeFi tokens’ returns (LUNA, AVAX, WBTC, UNI, 
DAI, LINK, FTM, XTZ, AAVE, GRT, MKR, CAKE, RUNE, CRV, and LRC) against bitcoin returns on weeks t-1 
and t-2. The results of our regressions are shown in Table 3.

*** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-value (*:10%, **:5%, and ***:1%). The standard t-statistic value is shown in

for weekly return. The number of observations for each regression is 265. 

We find that one-week lagged BTC returns have a positive and significant impact on future DeFiX returns, as well as 
on  several  leading  tokens.  LUNA,  WBTC,  MKR,  LINK,  FTM,  XTZ,  RUNE,  and  LRC  seem  to  be  positively 
influenced by one-week lagged BTC returns. This result is in line with (Corbet et al., 2021). Out of the fifteen major 
DeFi tokens included in our assessment,  nine show  to be impacted by BTC returns. If most of our results show  a 
positive impact of the previous week’s BTC returns on DeFi returns, we observe that DAI returns are negatively and 
significantly impacted by BTC’s one week ahead returns. LINK and MKR seem to be as well negatively impacted by 
BTC two weeks ahead return, which means that an increase in BTC will result in a return decrease for LINK, MKR, 
and DAI. Based on these obtained results, we argue that, in addition to the BTC’s influence arising from its role in 
DeFi operations, DeFi platforms might as well benefit from the cryptocurrencies’ hype and, hence, are driven by BTC 
variations.

3.1.2 The predictive power of ether coin 

Celeste  et  al.  (2020)  suggest  that  there  is  a  relationship  between  ETH  success  and  the  growth  of  Ethereum  based 
platforms.  As  most  DeFi  platforms  are  built  on  Ethereum  technology,  we  check  the  predictive  power  of  ETH  for 
DeFi’s returns. Therefore, we regress the DeFiX index returns and the main DeFi tokens against ETH one-week and 
two-weeks lagged returns. We summarize our results in Table 4.

*** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-value (*:10%, **:5%, and ***:1%). The standard t-statistic value is shown in 
parentheses. Here we check if ETH can help to predict DeFi tokens’ returns. Rt-1 (Rt-2) refers to one (two) week(s) lagged ETH returns. Rt stands 
for weekly return. The number of observations for each regression is 265. 

ETH predicting power for DeFis’ returns is similar to the one already reported for BTC. Out of the fifteen major DeFi 
platforms included in our test, eight show a significant increase in their returns due to the ETH returns increase the 
week  before. We  find  that  one-week  lagged  ETH  returns  have  an  important  impact  on  future  DeFiX  returns,  and 
several leading tokens. Similar to BTC predicting power assessment, MKR and LINK seem to be strongly positively 
(negatively) influenced by one (two) past weeks ETH returns; This result is in line with the existing literature (Agosto 
& Cafferata, 2020; Celeste et al., 2020; Chang & Shi, 2020), which show that compared to other pure financial assets 
like BTC or LTC, Ethereum is the main technology used in the development of service-based Blockchain instruments 
and distribution of tokens. Premised on this fact, Ethereum is an important contributor in the tokens’ pricing as well. 
LUNA and CAKE show a weak return impact by one-week lagged ETH. As we can observe, for the rest of the sample 
(AVAX, DAI, UNI, AAVE, GRT, RUNE, CRV), ETH does not show any significant predicting power.  

3.1.3 The predictive power of CRIX

At this point, we assess whether the crypto-market as a whole has an impact on DeFis’ returns. We regress the DeFiX 
index returns and the main DeFi tokens’ returns over the one-week and two-weeks lagged CRIX returns. Results are 
presented in Table 5.

*** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-value (*:10%, **:5%, and ***:1%). The standard t-statistic value is shown in 
parentheses. Here we check if CRIX can help to predict DeFi tokens’ returns. Rt-1 (Rt-2) refers to one (two) week(s) lagged CRIX returns. Rt stands 
for weekly return. The number of observations for each regression is 265. 

While assessing the CRIX predicting power for DeFis’, we observe that almost all leading DeFi tokens and the market 
index, DeFiX, are positively and significantly impacted by the increase in CRIX returns the week before. This result 
could be justified by a combined effect / predictive power of all cryptocurrencies applied through the CRIX index. In 
spite of being developed on Ethereum technology, AAVE is the only token  from our sample  that seems to  not be 
significantly influenced by the crypto-market at all. As in the assessment of BTC influence, the DAI token seems to 
be negatively impacted by one week before CRIX returns. Similarly, FTM and MKR are negatively impacted by two-
weeks  lagged  CRIX  returns,  meaning  that  an  increase  in  CRIX’s  returns  from  two  weeks  before  will  generate  a 
decrease in MKR and FTM returns. AVAX and CRV show a small impact in their returns due to CRIX returns increase 
the week before. We also find out that FTM and MKR returns are influenced by the CRIX return values one and two 
weeks before.  

In this section, we have investigated the predictive power of cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, and CRIX index) on the 
DeFiX market. Our findings show that BTC and ETH have a comparable strong and significant influence in predicting 
DeFi returns. While assessing the CRIX predicting power over DeFis, we observe that almost all leading DeFi tokens 
and the market index, DeFiX, are positively and significantly impacted. This result could be justified by a combined

effect  /  predictive  power  of  all  cryptocurrencies  applied  through  the  CRIX  index.  Overall,  our  empirical  analysis 
shows that the impact of the cryptocurrency market on DeFi returns is strong and statistically significant. 

3.2 Network effect 

“Whether real or virtual, networks have a fundamental economic characteristic: the value of connecting to a network 
depends on the number of other people already connected to it.”  (p.174, Shapiro & Varian, 1999). Katz & Shapiro 
(1985, 1986) have made some of the first contributions to the network economy literature, underlying for the first time 
the relationship between the fundamental value6 and network effects. This issue becomes more complex when the 
network is virtual, for example, in the case of software businesses, where “the linkages between nodes are invisible” 
but not inexistent (p.174, Shapiro & Varian, 1999). The (virtual) network effect exists in the crypto-market as well, 
and multiple papers assess its impact on the returns of cryptocurrencies (Biais et al., 2020; Cong et al., 2021; Pagnotta 
& Buraschi, 2018). The conclusion is quite clear: network effects make cryptocurrencies more useful as more people 
join the (Blockchain) network, and as a result of this, the entire crypto-ecosystem becomes more valuable. Considering 
that cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens both run on Blockchain technology and both belong to the same crypto-market, 
it seems relevant to assess whether the network effect also exists in the DeFi market. 

A significant part of the literature on cryptocurrencies has shown the importance of network factors in the valuation 
of cryptocurrencies (Bhambhwani et al., 2019; Biais et al., 2020; Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021; Sockin & Xiong, 2020). To 
the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work exploring the network effect for DeFi tokens valuation.  

Maouchi et al. (2021) and Saengchote (2021) argue that TVL is a reliable tool for DeFi market monitoring: “TVL is 
already considered by the crypto-community as one of the main indicators of DeFi markets size and growth” (Maouchi 
et al., 2021, page 7). One of (Cong et al., 2021)’s main assumptions with regards to token valuation is based on the 
expected growth of the network as a result of the platform’s increased productivity. Accordingly, we recognize TVL 
as an important variable in the network assessment.  The rationale  behind this represents simply the  fact that TVL 
represents the amount of funds committed to the DeFi business. This means that the more people join and transact on 
DeFi platforms (translating in more funds and bigger TVL), the larger the network will be.  

Active addresses and transactions count are commonly used as network variables in the crypto-market assessment 
(Hinzen et al., 2022; Koutmos, 2020; Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021; Nadler & Guo, 2020). We thus choose three factors as 
proxies  for  the  DeFi  network  effect:  the  active  address  count  and  the  transactions  count  (like  for  the  crypto-asset 
market), as well as the total value locked (TVL). As far as we know, we are the first to consider TVL as a proxy for 
network effect. To measure the network growth, we are using: the address growth, the transaction growth, and the 
TVL growth. The growth (noted Δ) of network variables is computed using the logarithmic difference method.

This table shows the correlation matrix of the network variables. The network factors include address growth (Δ address), transaction growth (Δ 
transac), and TVL growth (Δ tvl). *** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-value (*:10%, **:5%, and ***:1%). 

We first assess the correlation between the three network variables  we consider. The results presented in Table 6, 
show a positive relationship between transaction and address growth, with a correlation coefficient of 0.385. The TVL 
growth seems not correlated with any of the other two network variables. To evaluate the exposure of Defi returns to 
network variables, we run regressions of the DeFix returns over the growth of transactions, the growth of addresses, 
and the growth of TVL. Rt DeFiX represents the weekly returns of our index for the DeFi market: 

(7)    𝑅𝑡 𝐷𝑒𝐹𝑖𝑋 = 𝛼 +   𝛽1 Δ 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐 + 𝜀, 

6 fundamental value refers to the estimation of a security (e.g., stock, bonds, cryptocurrency) value, considering its incurred risks and the 
information within the market. It may be different from the market value, which is the current price. We cannot accurately determine the real 
value of a security, this is why we try to estimate it.

The  above  regressions  assess  the  direct  exposure  of  DeFiX  returns  to  the  growth  of  network  variables.  The  last 
regression regroups all network variables as independent variables in order to consider possible interaction effects. 
We present the regressions’ results in Table 7.

Table 4 reports the exposure of DeFiX’s returns to the (averaged) network factors. *** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-
value (*:10%, **:5%, and ***:1%). The standard t-statistic value is shown in parentheses. The data frequency is weekly. For each regression, 
we had 239 observations. 

We find that DeFiX returns are exposed to each network variable. The coefficients for transaction count and TVL 
growth are strongly significant in regressions (7), (9), and (10). This result confirms that the performance of the DeFi 
market, represented here by the DeFiX index, is driven by its fundamental value (as proxied by the network variables). 
In finance, fundamental value refers to the ‘real’ risk-adjusted value of a security, which may be different from the 
market value. As for stocks, where the fundamental value can be derived from accounting information on the firm’s 
operation (Brainard et al., 1990), we believe that DeFis derive their value from the network. This rationale is based 
on (Katz & Shapiro, 1986) theory, which debates that the technology’s adoption and value evolution are linked to its 
network size. Out of the three variables tested, our results show that the transaction count and the TVL growth have 
the strongest relationship with DeFi returns. These two variables reflect the platform’s success (value), therefore, an 
increase in transaction count and TVL translates into an increase in financial returns for DeFi tokens holders. On the 
same point but in the crypto-market, (Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021) find that all network variables play an important role in 
the valuation of cryptocurrencies.  

Furthermore,  we  assess  the  impact  of  network  variables’  growth  on  individual  tokens’  returns.  We  perform  panel 
regressions using the network data we have. We first regress the DeFis’ returns on the network variables change for 
all DeFis’ tokens for which we have network information. This allows us to assess as many tokens as possible and 
thus to enlarge the picture from only leading DeFis. Afterward, we make a panel regression using only the leading 
tokens, in line with the previous section. 

3.2.1. Exposure to TVL growth 

We start with our first network variable: TVL growth. We have TVL information for 160 tokens. Therefore, we first 
perform the regression of the DeFi tokens returns over the change in TVL for all 160 tokens. We then only focus our 
attention on the 15 leading tokens. We lagged TVL growth from 1 week up to 4 weeks. Results are shown in Table 8 
and Table 9.

R2 is 1.42%, R2 between is 9.43%. We regressed the returns of 160 DeFi tokens against their Δ TVL lagged from 1 week to 4 weeks. Time effects 
included. We used weekly returns and weekly TVL growth. For this regression, we had 7453 observations. *** denotes significance levels based 
on the respective p-value (*:10%, **:5%, and ***:1%). 

Our results show that 1 and 3 weeks ahead TVL growth can positively predict DeFis’ return increase.  

We then perform the same panel regression, but this time we consider only the 15 major DeFi tokens. This approach 
was used in section 3.1, when we assessed the DeFis’ exposure to the cryptocurrency market.

findings. More specifically, we observe that all leading tokens are positively and significantly impacted by the 1-week 
ahead increase in TVL growth. As mentioned before, TVL represents the amount locked in DeFi platforms. Our results 
indicate  that  when  the  value  locked  in  the  platform  increases,  the  value  (return)  of  the  corresponding  DeFi  token 
increases as well. 

3.2.2. Exposure to transaction count growth 

Our second network variable is transaction count growth. We have transaction count information for 21 tokens. First, 
we regress all 21 tokens returns against their lagged transaction growth. In a second step, we refer only to the 15 
leading tokens. We lagged transaction growth from 1 week up to 4 weeks. Results are shown in Table 10 and Table 
11.

R2 is 0.22%, R2 between is -0.07%. We regressed the returns of major DeFi tokens against their Δ Transac. lagged from 1 week to 4 weeks. Time 
effects included. We used weekly returns and weekly Transaction growth. For this regression, we had 1832 observations. The standard t-statistic 
value is shown in parentheses. 

According to the first regression (21 tokens), DeFi returns appear to be negatively and significantly impacted by the 
change in one week, two weeks, and four weeks ahead transaction growth. This indicates that the more transactions 
are placed on the DeFi platform, the lower the return of the corresponding token. While a bit surprising, these results 
could be explained by the increased volatility and large financial bubbles present in the DeFi market (Maouchi et al., 
2021). At the same time, (Hau et al., 2021) show that cryptocurrency returns can be positively (negatively) influenced 
by  transaction activity if the  market  state  is  bullish (bearish). The same could be true  for the  DeFi  market,  as the 
presence of large bubbles justifies the less efficient prices. While out of the scope of this paper, more investigations 
on this matter are necessary.  

The regression performed with only leading tokens does not report any significant results. This means that no major 
tokens considered in this analysis are impacted by transaction growth.  

3.2.3. Exposure to address count growth 

Our last network variable is the address count growth. We have address count information for 21 tokens. Therefore, 
we regress all 21 tokens’ returns against their address growth in a panel data regression analysis. In a second step, we 
then refer only to the leading tokens. We lagged address growth from 1 week up to  4 weeks. Results are shown in 
Table 12 and Table 13.

R2 is 0.11%, R2 between is -1.71%. We regressed the returns of major DeFi tokens against their Δ Address lagged from 1 week to 4 weeks. Time 
effects included. We used weekly returns and weekly Address growth. For this regression, we had 1836 observations. The standard t-statistic 
value is shown in parentheses. 

Similar to our previous results concerning transaction growth, we can observe that in the first panel data regression 
(21 tokens), DeFi returns are negatively impacted by the change in one week ahead address growth. The regression 
performed with only the leading tokens does not report any significant results. This translates as, the more addresses 
are created for a specific DeFi platform, the lower the return of the corresponding token in the next week. Motivated 

12 

 
by the findings from (Hau et al., 2021) that include address number in their sample, we think that DeFi returns can be 
positively (negatively) influenced by address growth if the market state is bullish (bearish). These results confirm the 
inefficiency of DeFi prices, in line  with (Corbet et al., 2021; Maouchi et al., 2021), although further investigation 
would be necessary. 

Same  as  our  findings  from  section  3.2.2,  the  regression  performed  with  only  leading  tokens  does  not  report  any 
significant results. This means that no major tokens considered in this analysis are impacted by address growth.  

In this section, we have assessed the predictive power of network variables (the active address count, the transactions 
count, and TVL) on the DeFi market returns. Our results show that the DeFi returns are strongly influenced by their 
network variables, like cryptocurrencies (Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021).  Overall, our empirical study shows that the impact 
of the TVL growth over DeFi returns is stronger than any other network variable considered and provides superior 
explanatory power. 

3.3  Investor attention 

Investor attention impacts financial market characteristics, including liquidity, returns, and volatility. This hypothesis 
has been proved to be valid in both traditional markets and cryptocurrencies ones (Andrei & Hasler, 2015; Ciaian et 
al.,  2015;  Lin,  2020;  Liu  et  al.,  2022).  Often,  investor  attention  is  associated  with  the  under-  and  overreaction  of 
investors,  being  considered  a  key  determinant  of  potential  market  mispricing  (Andrei  &  Hasler,  2015;  Baker  & 
Wurgler,  2007;  Shiller,  2000).  Tversky  &  Kahneman  (1974)  investigate  individuals’  capacity  to  make  rational 
decisions in situations of uncertainty. They show that people tend to perceive certain events in a specific way that 
ignores the laws of probability. In the financial markets, this could translate in situations such as investors seeing that 
the cryptocurrencies’ price keeps increasing, they will consider it a growing market and invest in, ignoring the laws 
of probability such as this being just a bubble phase (J. Li & Yu, 2012). The traditional asset-pricing theory assumes 
that markets assimilate new information rapidly, and securities’ prices adjust and incorporate the news. Shiller (1980) 
proposes the use of volatility measure in assessing market efficiency. By looking at the high volatility present in the 
cryptocurrency market (M. Hu et al., 2018; Noda, 2021; Tran & Leirvik, 2020), we assume that their prices cannot be 
linked to economic realities but rather to investors’ irrational decision making described by psychological models such 
as the one developed by (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). This claim is based on the premise that the crypto-market 
could be inefficient (prices deviate from their fundamental value), a subject highly debated in the literature (Y. Hu et 
al., 2019; Kristoufek & Vosvrda, 2019; Tran & Leirvik, 2019; Wei, 2018; Yaya et al., 2021) and which brought mixed 
conclusions.  

Given the vast literature introducing the importance of investor attention in the cryptocurrency market and its key role 
in asset pricing (Corbet et al., 2019; Guégan & Renault, 2021; Guzmán et al., 2020; Ibikunle et al., 2020; Z. Li et al., 
2021; Lin, 2020; Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021; Nasir et al., 2019; W. Zhang & Wang, 2020), it seems relevant to study this 
phenomenon on the DeFi market.  

Similar to the (Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021) paper, we build proxies for investor’s attention with Google searches. Hence, 
to assess the impact of investor’s attention on DeFi returns, we extracted the  number of  google searches for DeFi 
related keywords: ‘Decentralized finance’ (noted “dcfin” in our following table and equation) and ‘DeFi’. We selected 
these two keywords while thinking about the unique features of the DeFi market. The name, ‘DeFi” is an abbreviation 
for decentralized finance. While words like “decentralization” and “decentralized finance”  are generally associated 
with  Blockchain  and  cryptocurrencies,  DeFi  platforms  are  the  only  technology  that  makes  complete  finance 
decentralization possible.  

The second key-word represents simply the general name for all the tokens belonging to DeFi platforms. In this way, 
we assume that the investors who have some knowledge about Blockchain will know about ‘decentralized finance’, 
but only the connoisseurs (informed investors) will be the ones understanding the “DeFi” term.  

The interest of an investor for a particular investment might not be immediate. For that reason, we perform our tests 
on different periods, and we lag the Google search-based proxy from one up to three weeks (between the investor’s 
interest and his potential investment). Consequently, we perform the following regressions:

3 𝛽𝑖 𝑑𝑐𝑓𝑖𝑛(𝑡 − 𝑖) +   ∑𝑗=1

Results are shown in Table 14.

Here we assess the predictive power of investor’s attention, proxied by google search terms “Decentralized finance” (denoted as “dcfin”) and 
“DeFi”. We regressed DeFiX index, and major DeFi tokens’ returns against the google search lagged from one up to three-weeks horizons. Rt 
stands for weekly returns. For each regression, we had 250 observations. *** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-value (*:10%, 
**:5%, and ***:1%). The standard t-statistic value is shown in parentheses. 

We find that Google searches have a significant impact just on some DeFi token returns. Furthermore, the impact of 
the search for ‘decentralized finance’ seems stronger than for ‘DeFi’. Decentralized finance is a concept that is not 
limited to DeFi platforms, but it has been around for a longer period of time (e.g. (Dillinger & Fay, 1999)). Moreover, 
the idea of decentralization has been widely discussed since Blockchain’s invention (Chuen & Deng, 2018; Guo & 
Liang, 2016; Harwick & Caton, 2020; Karaulova, 2017; Leonhard, 2019; Swan, 2017; Yeoh, 2017), therefore this 
result is not surprising taking into account that DeFi is based on Blockchain technology.  

We cannot ignore the fact that ‘decentralized finance’ search has a negative impact on the DeFi market, meaning that 
an increased investor attention (proxied by ‘decentralized finance’) will decrease DeFi returns. This could be explained 
by the high volatility present and insufficient development of the young DeFi market. Moreover, since ‘decentralized 
finance’ is not limited only to DeFi and as we have shown in section 3.1, the DeFi market is exposed to the crypto-
market, our results could be justified by possible linkage and transmissions from one asset to another. More research 
is needed on this matter. ‘DeFi’ term is specific to DeFi markets only. Hence, our findings showing a positive impact 
prove that an increase in investor attention (proxied by ‘DeFi’ searches) induces an increase in tokens’ returns.  

14 

 
 
By looking at our results, we can observe that only four7 out of fifteen major tokens seem to be impacted by google 
searches. Since globally, the market returns (represented by DeFiX) can be predicted from investor’s attention, we 
therefore assume that smaller tokens might be influenced by google searches. Liu & Tsyvinski (2021) and  Shen et 
al., (2019) report an increased investor attention during the period of high volatility. Similarly, (Karim et al., 2022) 
paper reveals an increased investor attention on DeFi market following the enhanced volatility. As our results do not 
provide enough evidence to draw any conclusions regarding DeFi market efficiency, we believe that more research is 
necessary. 

3.4  DeFi valuation ratio 

In this section, we investigate the ability of a DeFi market specific ‘book-to-market’ ratio to predict DeFi returns.  

While researchers and practitioners have always tried to identify the variables that could help to predict future returns, 
the  motivation to use the book-to-market ratio as a possible driver has arisen after the findings of  Fama & French 
(1992).  In  their  paper  (Fama  &  French,  1992),  Fama  and  French  reveal  that  the  book-to-market  ratio  has  more 
explanatory  power  for  the  cross-sectional  variations  in  stock  returns  than  traditional  risk  measures.  On  another 
perspective, Lakonishok et al. (1994) and La Porta (1996) believe that the book-to-market ratio is just an evidence of 
mispricing, as investors form biased expectations concerning the future prospects and firm value based on accounting 
information. Many papers have already shown the ability of the book-to-market ratio to predict future returns on both 
traditional markets (Ball et al., 2020; Pontiff & Schall, 1998) and the cryptocurrency market (Cong et al., 2021). Liu 
& Tsyvinski (2021) do not find any significant relationship between the valuation ratio and the future cryptocurrency 
return. Motivated by the existing literature on the cryptocurrency market and by the studies of other financial markets, 
we find it relevant to investigate whether the book-to-market ratio can predict DeFi returns. 

The classic book-to-market ratio used in the stock market compares a company's book value to its market value. The 
book value refers to the accounting data (total value of assets minus total liabilities), and the market value represents 
the market price of one share multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding.  

If the market value is easily available for both stocks and cryptocurrencies, we know that there is no direct measure 
of  the  book  value  for  cryptocurrencies.  In  their  pricing  model,  Cong  et  al.  (2021)  propose  a  cryptocurrency 
fundamental-to-value  ratio  as  the  number  of  users  over  market  capitalization.  Further,  they  show  that  this  ratio 
negatively  predicts  future  cryptocurrency  returns.  Consistent  with  the  literature  on  cryptocurrencies,  there  is  no 
measure of book value for DeFi tokens. Corbet et al., (2021) and Maouchi et al., (2021) show that TVL can be used 
as a tool to monitor DeFi’s success. TVL represents the total value allocated in a DeFi platform, and it can therefore 
be considered as (some of) its intrinsic value. The more people join and transact on DeFi platforms (translating in 
more funds and bigger TVL), the bigger the network will be. One of the Cong et al. (2021)’s main assumptions with 
regards  to  token  valuation  is  based  on  the  expected  growth  of  the  network  as  a  result  of  the  platform’s  increased 
productivity. Accordingly, we recognize TVL as a proxy for DeFi’s ‘book’ value measure.   

Before computing our valuation ratio, we investigate if the market values DeFi tokens based on their locked intrinsic 
value (TVL). For this, we simply plot the log market capitalization against the log. TVL, see Fig. 2.  We found that 
there is a linear relationship between the two variables, meaning that DeFi tokens with high TVL have high market 
capitalization. 

Furthermore,  we  construct  the  Book-to-Market  ratio  for  the  DeFi  market  by  dividing  the  TVL  by  the  Market 
Capitalization (MC). What we obtain is the TVL-to-Market ratio valuation, and we test its predictive power for DeFi 
token returns. For this analysis, we perform panel data regressions using the TVL-to-Market ratio. We first regress 
the DeFis returns (considering the DeFis for which we have the TVL information) on the TVL-to-Market ratio8. In a 
second step, we perform a panel data regression using only the 15 leading tokens (as we did in the previous sections). 
The reason behind this approach is to capture a bigger and more realistic picture of the DeFi market and not only 

7 LINK, XTZ, MKR and LRC 
8 We are using TVL data in constructing this valuation ratio. As mentioned in the network effect section, we have TVL data for only 160 tokens, 
therefore, our TVL-To-Market ratio will be computed for 160 tokens as well.

results based on referring to the leading tokens. With these panel data regressions, we capture the impact of the TVL-
to-Market ratio on the returns of DeFi.

In this graph, we can observe the linear relationship between DeFi’s market capitalization and TVL. This suggests that the bigger the market 
capitalization is, the bigger the TVL.

The regression (16) tests the predictive power of our TVL-to-Market ratio on a DeFi token’s returns. We do not make 
any  initial  assumptions  about  the  ratio  horizon  of  prediction,  and  we  consider  four  different  lags  for  the  TVL-to-
Market ratio. Results are shown in Table 15 and Table 16.

R2 is 1.45%. R2 Between is 3%. Panel regression of major DeFi tokens against their Valuation Ratio = TVL/MarketCap. The data frequency is 
weekly. For this regression, we had 747 observations. The standard t-statistic value is shown in parentheses. 

As many researchers have shown that the book-to-market ratio predicts future returns on the stock market (Fama & 
French, 1992; Pontiff & Schall, 1998), we expect to reach the same conclusions about the DeFi market. Our results 
show that most of the DeFi token returns are positively (negatively) driven by the past increase in the TVL/MC ratio 
two  (three)  weeks  ago.  This  indicates  that  when  the  value  of  a  DeFi  platform  increases  (relative  to  its  market 

16 

 
  
valuation), financial returns decrease in the following two  weeks. On the other hand, Table 16 shows that leading 
DeFi’s returns are not driven by our TVL/MC ratio. While our results are surprising, mainly thanks to the contrasting 
findings in week two and three, we think that they do not offer any obvious conclusions.  

In the traditional markets, we often see studies (Ball et al., 2020; Pontiff & Schall, 1998) with Book-to-Market ratio 
that use monthly data. This is because the book value of a firm is renewed on a monthly basis. It is not the case for 
cryptocurrency  and  DeFi  markets,  where  all  the  financial  information  is  publicly  available  on  Blockchain  and 
constantly updated. For comparison purposes, we decided to use monthly data and investigate the ability of the TVL-
to-market ratio to predict DeFi returns. The results are reported in appendix section D and are inconclusive.  

IV.Discussion and conclusion  

In  this  work,  we  address  the  following  global  research  question:  ‘What  drives  DeFi  returns?’.  Following  Liu  & 
Tsyvinski (2021)’s paper, which presents a comprehensive analysis of cryptocurrencies’ returns, we performed an in-
depth analysis of the determinants of the DeFi market returns. We consider several possible driving factors, such as: 
(1) the exposure of DeFi tokens to the cryptocurrency market, (2) the exposure to network variables, (3) the exposure 
to investor’s attention and (4) the predictive power of TVL-to-Market valuation ratio.  

Corbet et al., (2021) and Maouchi et al., (2021) show that DeFi tokens are distinct from the cryptocurrency asset class.  
Therefore, our first contribution is to compute a DeFi market benchmark based on the CRIX’s methodology (‘an index 
for  Blockchain  based  currencies’).  Considering  that  cryptocurrencies  and  DeFi  tokens  both  run  on  Blockchain 
technology and belong to the crypto-market, our second contribution is to assess the exposure of DeFi token returns 
to the cryptocurrency market. Our results show that the cryptocurrency market strongly influences DeFi returns, fact 
confirmed by Corbet et al. (2021) and Yousaf & Yarovaya (2021).  

The network effect in the crypto-market could be described as: a cryptocurrency’s value and utility increases when 
more people join the  network/ Blockchain. Vast  literature (e.g.,  (Ante, 2020; Cong et al., 2021; Liu & Tsyvinski, 
2021)) shows that the cryptocurrency market is highly impacted by its network effect. Therefore, our third contribution 
is to assess if the same holds for DeFi tokens. We thus have measured the network effect in the DeFi market by using 
three proxies: the transaction count, unique addresses count, and TVL. If the first two variables have been previously 
used in the cryptocurrency-related literature, we are, as far as we know, the first ones to use the TVL. This represents 
the fourth contribution of this paper. TVL is a unique variable characteristic of the DeFi market. It reflects the amount 
of funds committed to DeFi platforms, and it is an indicator of market growth and success. While all three network 
variables seem to have an important impact on DeFis returns, the transactions and TVL seem to be the most significant 
ones. Here we also show that DeFi returns are negatively impacted by the transaction and address growth. This could 
be explained by the presence of high volatility and large financial bubbles in the DeFi market (Maouchi et al., 2021). 
Similar  findings  are  presented  in  (Hau  et  al.,  2021),  which  shows  that  cryptocurrency  returns  can  be  positively 
(negatively) influenced by transaction activity if the market state is bullish (bearish). 

A  vast  literature  has  shown  the  importance  of  investor  attention  in  asset  pricing  for  both  traditional  markets  and 
cryptocurrencies  (Andrei  &  Hasler,  2015;  Ciaian  et  al.,  2015;  Lin,  2020;  Liu  et  al.,  2022).  Similarly,  the  fifth 
contribution of this paper is to assess  whether investor’s attention has an impact on the  DeFi  market as  well. We 
construct proxies for investor attention with Google searches for the “decentralized finance” and “DeFi” terms. Our 
results show that high investor attention, proxied by “DeFi” term search, predicts high future returns over one to three-
weeks horizons. Google searches for “decentralized finance” term are negatively impacting DeFis, meaning that in 
this case, high investor attention predicts lower future returns over one to three weeks. An interesting fact is that the 
tokens impacted by investor’s attention, are also the ones strongly impacted by cryptocurrencies, with a  predictability 
statistically  significant  (high  R  squared).  Overall,  our  analysis  shows  that  Google  searches  have  a  significant  and 
strong impact on DeFi returns.  

Motivated by the existing literature on the cryptocurrency market and studies of other financial markets, we investigate 
if DeFi returns can be predicted by their ‘book-to-market’ ratio. As there is no standard ‘book’ value for DeFi tokens, 
we have constructed a Book-to-Market ratio for the DeFi market by dividing the TVL by the Market Capitalization 
(MC). This represents the sixth contribution of this paper. TVL represents the total value allocated in a DeFi platform, 

17 

 
and  it  can  therefore  be  considered  as  (some  of)  its  intrinsic  value.  The  results  obtained  do  not  offer  any  obvious 
answers. Hence, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to support our assumption that the TVL-to-Market 
ratio contains information about future DeFi returns.  

Overall, our empirical study shows that the impact of the cryptocurrency market on DeFi returns is stronger than any 
other driver considered in this analysis and provides superior explanatory power. A possible limitation for this paper 
is the restricted information available for network data: transaction and address count.  

As a future avenue for investigation, it would be interesting to see how network factors impact DeFi returns during 
different  market  states.  Another  idea  is  to  group  and  assess  DeFi  returns  based  on  their  volatility  level.  Further 
evidence concerning DeFis’ price efficiency would greatly complement the findings of this study. There is an obvious 
need for research on the NFT market as well. Dowling (2022) and Karim et al. (2022) reveal that NFTs are a distinct 
asset class from conventional cryptocurrencies; therefore, it would be interesting to construct a benchmark for  this 
market and analyze the proprieties of NFTs prices.

Appendix 

A.  A brief DeFi market description 

Cryptocurrencies  aim  to  replace  or  offer  alternative  payment  tools  and  money,  while  DeFi  platforms  seek  to 
revolutionize the financial system as a whole. Like bitcoin, DeFi platforms run on Blockchains (distributed ledger) 
technology,  onto  which  decentralized  applications  (based  on  smart  contracts)  are  added  (Popescu,  2020).  DeFi’s 
applications  provide  financial  services  that  rely  on  cryptocurrencies  and  crypto  tokens.  Their  goal  is  to  provide  a 
digital alternative to traditional banking, exchange, and investment services (Anker-Sørensen & Zetzsche, 2021). With 
decentralized  applications  (dApps)  deployed  on  the  Blockchain,  DeFi  can  bring  numerous  benefits,  among  which 
reduced operational costs, borderless financial service access, and improved privacy. Like cryptocurrencies, DeFi uses 
public Blockchains that make it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Decentralized finance platforms are 
often  compared  to  puzzles  or  Lego  mainly  because  these  tools  are  complex  and  use  multiple  technological  layers 
(Katona, 2021; Popescu, 2020; Schäfer, 2021). Anyone interested in developing a new decentralized finance solution 
can  get  the  source  code  of  the  existing  platforms  and  create  innovations  while  combining  parts  of  the  current 
applications.  

It is important to mention that regardless of their scope, DeFi platforms are very different from one another in terms 
of both development and operation. While constructed around similar principles as traditional finance, decentralized 
finance works in substantially different ways (Aramonte et al., 2021). For example, loans in the DeFi world are not 
always using physical collateral but rather some digital assets (e.g., Non-Fungible Tokens – NFT, bitcoins, ether) that, 
once deposed, will allow the borrowing of another digital coin. In this scenario, the user lending capital earns interest 
without the intervention of any central authority, and the borrower can further invest (without intermediaries) its funds 
in other services such as trading or portfolios (Corbet et al., 2021). As describing the whole business model of DeFi 
platforms is out of our scope, a detailed description can be found in (Harwick & Caton, 2020; Ramos & Zanko, 2021; 
Schär, 2021; Stepanova & Eriņš, 2021; Zetzsche et al., 2020; Zumwalde et al., 2021).  

From a technological perspective, DeFi tokens (abr. DeFis) and cryptocurrencies are similar in the sense that both are 
based on Blockchain technology and implement decentralized (automatic) management.  

Compared to cryptocurrencies’ functions (money-like) (Baur & Dimpfl, 2021; Hazlett & Luther, 2020), DeFi tokens 
resemble  more to ICO tokens. ICO tokens can  fulfill  multiple roles, more specifically, they can be used to obtain 
products or services, can be traded on a platform (secondary market), and/or could be held to earn a profit (Le Moign, 
2019).  As  DeFi  platforms  can  perform  most  of  the  things  that  banks  do  — lend,  trade  assets,  earn  interest,  buy 
insurance, borrow, trade derivatives, and more (Coinbase, n.d.), these activities are supported by complex tokens with 
different functions depending on the platform’s needs. For example, DeFi platforms can have transactional tokens 
(e.g., stablecoins: Dai, TUSD, USDC, WBTC) that facilitate fund transfers across platforms (Aramonte et al., 2021), 
governance tokens (e.g., MKR, COMP, YFI) that enable users to take part in the platform development, resembling 
with the common stock, utility tokens are used in the same way as in ICOs, to obtain access to the platform’s services 
(in-App payment ‘currencies’), liquidity provider (LP) tokens are used as a reward for the users contributing to the 
liquidity of a DEX (decentralized exchange), and collateral tokens are used on lending platforms, a practice similar to 
the bank loans (e.g., stablecoins, LP, ETH, NFTs) (MakerDAO.com, 2021). Despite their distinct nature, ICO tokens 
have been often studied together with other digital assets, first considering the relationship between Blockchain tokens 
and  cryptocurrencies,  and  second,  considering  that  they  all  belong  to  the  same  crypto-market  (Fahlenbrach  & 
Frattaroli, 2021; Howell et al., 2020; A. S. Hu et al., 2019; Lyandres et al., 2018; Maouchi et al., 2021).

An important variable used in this paper is the total value locked (abr. TVL). TVL is a unique variable characteristic 
of the DeFi market and refers to the amount of funds attached to a DeFi project. More specifically, if we take the 
example of lending platforms, TVL is the amount put into DeFi projects as collateral for the loans taken. To compute 
the TVL, we multiply the amount of crypto-assets staked as collateral on the Blockchain by their current price. 

B.  DeFiX computation 

To the best of our knowledge, the development of the entire DeFi market has not yet been studied, and only samples 
have been taken into account (Corbet et al., 2021; Karim et al., 2022; Stepanova & Eriņš, 2021; Yousaf et al., 2022). 
We contribute to this area of research and design “DeFiX”, a market index (benchmark) that will enable each interested 
party to study the performance of the DeFi market as a whole. 

Similar  to  the  CRIX  index,  which  was  created  out  of  the  need  to  assess  the  emerging  market  of  cryptocurrencies 
accurately, DeFiX aims to represent a new asset class for which public interest has arisen: DeFi tokens. According to 
its name (Trimborn & Härdle, 2018), CRIX is ‘an Index for Blockchain-based currencies’. Considering the fact that 
cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens run on Blockchain technology and belong to the same crypto-market,  we find it 
appropriate to use CRIX index methodology and a variant of its original code9 to construct DeFiX. 

CRIX formula is a derivation of Laspeyres index: 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 =

𝑖

∑ 𝑃𝑖𝑡𝑄𝑖0
∑ 𝑃𝑖0𝑄𝑖0

𝑖

,  where Pit is the price of asset i at time t, and Qi0 

is the quantity of asset i at time 0. Laspeyres statistic represents a consumer price index and has been developed to 
measure the price change of the basket of goods and services consumed.  

Adjusting the index for capital markets makes the quantity Qi0 a measure for the number of shares of the asset i, which 
is  multiplied  with  its  corresponding  price,  resulting  in  the  market  capitalization.  Therefore,  the  index  components 
(stocks) are weighted by their market capitalizations. As markets change all the time, it is important that the index 
contains the most appropriate market representatives as its members. Hence, the components of the index must change 
in tone with the market state. To make this possible, there are several adjustments in the CRIX formula (Trimborn & 
Härdle, 2018): 

(B.1.) 𝐶𝑅𝐼𝑋𝑡 (𝑘, 𝛽) =

𝑘
∑ 𝛽𝑖,𝑡𝑙
−𝑃𝑖𝑡𝑄𝑖,𝑡𝑙
−
𝑖
𝐷𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑟(𝑘)𝑡𝑙
−

Where k is the number of constituents, 𝑄𝑖𝑙 represents the amount (quantity) of coin i at time t,  𝑃𝑖𝑙 is the price of coin 
− , l indicates that this is the l-th adjustment 
i at time t,  𝛽𝑖,𝑡𝑙
factor, and 𝑡𝑙
− have been updated. The denominator has been 
replaced by a divisor which is specific to each index (Trimborn & Härdle, 2018). Its formula is:  

− represents the adjustment factor of cryptocurrency i at time 𝑡𝑙
− is the last time point when 𝑄𝑖,𝑡𝑙

−, 𝐷𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑟(𝑘)𝑡𝑙

− and 𝛽𝑖,𝑡𝑙

(𝐵. 2. ) 𝐷𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑟 (𝑘, 𝛽)0 =

𝑘
𝑖−1

∑ 𝛽𝑖0 ×   𝑃𝑖0 × 𝑄𝑖0
𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒

The divisor is changing every time there is a change in the number of components (k) and ensures that the adjustments 
are stable. The starting value of the CRIX Index is 1000 (Trimborn & Härdle, 2018).  

The selection criteria for cryptocurrencies before being included in the index is made based on the Akaike Information 
Criterion  (AIC),  meaning  that  only  the  most  representative  cryptocurrencies  of  the  market  will  be  taken  into 
consideration.  More  specifically,  cryptocurrencies  must  have  sufficient  price  movements,  meaning  that  they  are 
actively  traded  and  are  among  the  largest  representatives  by  market  capitalization  (over  1,000,000  USD).  As  a 
common practice for the stock market indexes, CRIX members will always be a multiple of five (Trimborn & Härdle, 
2018).  
DeFiX benchmark is computed using the exact same steps as described above in the CRIX methodology. We have 
removed the DeFi tokens with less than 1,000,000 USD market capitalization. Then, we ran the CRIX code with our 
DeFi data and built a value-weighted market index of the DeFi market as a whole, comprising 95 components.

R2 is 10.18%. R2 Between is 23.21%. Panel regression of major DeFi tokens against their Valuation Ratio = TVL/MarketCap. The data 
frequency is monthly. For this regression, we had 148 observations. *** denotes significance levels based on the respective p-value (*:10%, 
**:5%, and ***:1%). The standard t-statistic value is shown in parentheses. 

By looking at our results, we find that most of the DeFi token returns are strongly negatively (and significantly) driven 
by the past increase in the TVL/MC ratio (two and four months ago). This indicates that when the value of a DeFi 
platform decreases (relative to its market valuation), financial returns increase in the following two and four months. 
At the same time, if the ratio goes down (market capitalization increases or TVL decreases), it means that the market 
overvalues the DeFi, translating in an increase (correction) of the DeFi returns two and four months after. Consistent

with this result, our regression on leading tokens shows as well that there is a negative  and significant relationship 
between DeFi returns and the two previous months’ TVL/MC ratio.  

A surprising result is that contrary to the current results, DeFi token returns seem to be strongly and positively driven 
by three previous months’ TVL/MC ratio. Therefore, we conclude that our analysis provides inconclusive evidence.
