Abstract—Popular permissionless distributed ledger technology
(DLT) systems using proof-of-work (PoW) for Sybil attack resis-
tance have extreme energy requirements, drawing stern criticism
from academia, business, and the media. DLT systems building on
alternative consensus mechanisms, foremost proof-of-stake (PoS),
aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take a ﬁrst step
towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to
understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While
multiple studies have been undertaken that analyze the energy
demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has
been done. We approach this research gap by formalizing a
basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this
model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main ﬁndings:
First, we conﬁrm the concerns around the energy footprint of
PoW by showing that Bitcoin’s energy consumption exceeds the
energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analyzed by at least
two orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in energy consumption among the PoS-
based systems analyzed, with permissionless systems having an
overall larger energy footprint. Third, we point out that the type
of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on
whether PoS blockchains’ energy consumption is comparable with
or considerably larger than that of centralized, non-DLT systems.

I. Introduction

In distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems, consensus
mechanisms fulﬁll multiple purposes surrounding the proposal,
validation, propagation, and ﬁnalization of data [1]. A critical
problem for DLT systems are Sybil attacks in which an attacker
creates an artiﬁcially large number of bogus identities [2] to
skew the results of majority decisions on the admission and
order of transactions. In permissioned networks, gatekeeping
strategies can be applied that limit access to a network to
previously vetted actors [3], thereby preventing such attacks.
However, for permissionless networks, in which participants
can participate in consensus without any control [4], more com-
plex mechanisms need to be applied to combat Sybil attacks.
Proof-of-work (PoW) is an example of a Sybil attack resistance
scheme that has been used in most early cryptocurrencies
such as Bitcoin [5]. To counteract Sybil attacks, PoW uses
cryptographic puzzles of conﬁgurable diﬃculty with eﬃcient

veriﬁcation such that it becomes computationally expensive for
attackers to interfere with consensus [6]. However, by this de-
sign, the energy consumption of a PoW-based cryptocurrency
strongly correlates with its market capitalization, leading to
an extreme energy demand for popular implementations [7].
For instance, the electricity demand of Bitcoin is now in
the same range as that of entire industrialized nations [8].
Against this backdrop, many alternatives to PoW have been
proposed that do not rely on extensive computational eﬀort [9].
Among those is proof-of-stake (PoS) in which participants
with larger holdings of a cryptocurrency have larger inﬂuence
in transaction validation. While PoS is generally understood
as being more energy eﬃcient than PoW, the exact energy
consumption characteristics of PoS-based systems, and the
inﬂuence that network throughput has on them, are not widely
understood.

Two main approaches to quantify the energy consumption
of a DLT system have been assumed in the past. One is to
measure the consumption of a representative participant node
and then extrapolate from this measurement. An alternative
approach is to develop a mathematical model that includes core
metrics of a DLT system to calculate its energy consumption.
Extensive research eﬀorts have cumulated in best practices
for determining the energy consumption of DLT systems [10].
So far, most work has focused on PoW blockchains,1 and
some research has investigated individual non-PoW systems.
In this paper we propose a simple energy consumption model,
applicable to a broad range of DLT systems that use PoS for
Sybil attack resistance. Speciﬁcally, this model considers the
number of validator nodes, their energy consumption, and the
network throughput based on which the energy consumption
per transaction is estimated. We present the results of applying
this model to six PoS-based systems. Our results illustrate that,
while negligible compared to PoW, the energy consumption
of PoS systems can still vary signiﬁcantly.

The next section surveys related work in both experimental
and mathematical models. We then review selected PoS sys-

of hash-linked blocks, the term “blockchain” is customarily interchangeable
with DLT. In the remainder, we follow this convention for simplicity.

 
 
 
 
 
 
tems – Ethereum 2.0, Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot, Tezos, and
Hedera – and describe their relevant architectural features. In
the following section, we introduce our model in more detail
and describe how the underlying data was obtained. We apply
the model to the systems selected, present the comparative
results, and discuss limitations. Finally, we conclude our study
with potential avenues for future research.

II. Related Work

We conducted an informal literature review using the search
("Blockchain" OR "DLT" OR "Distributed

string
Ledger") AND ("Energy Consumption" OR "Energy
Demand" OR "Electricity Demand" OR "Carbon
Footprint") year:[2008 TO *]
Bielefeld
Academic Search Engine (BASE). We thereby obtained
413 results of various prior work on analyzing the energy
demand of diﬀerent DLT systems, with a signiﬁcant focus
on PoW blockchains in general and speciﬁcally Bitcoin.
Commonly, models take one of the following two forms.

the

on

Experimental Models: The ﬁrst form revolves around
conducting experiments using mining hardware and measuring
its actual energy consumption, as done by Igumenov et al. with
diﬀerent conﬁgurations of computational resources [11]. This
approach has been used to derive consumption characteristics
for diﬀerent usage scenarios. The “BCTMark” framework [12],
for instance, allows for the deployment of an entire experiment
stack, including the DLT system under test. Using load gener-
ators, a realistic network workload can be created. The eﬀects
on the energy consumption of this setup under varying loads
can subsequently be measured via energy sensors connected to
the testbed. An experimental study on the energy consumption
of the non-PoW XRP ledger demonstrates that customizing
validator hardware can yield reductions in energy demand [13].
Metrics reported for common cryptocurrencies have been
combined with testbed experiments to model the energy con-
sumption behaviors of various consensus algorithms [14].

Mathematical Models: An alternative method is to quan-
tify assumptions about the environment in which a DLT system
operates. Often, such models use a “top-down” approach that
relies on publicly observable factors – such as hash rate in the
case of Bitcoin – and associate them with common mining
hardware or even seek to determine the hardware used via
surveys [10]. The papers of Gallersdörfer et al. [15], Küfeoglu
and Özkuran [16], and Zade et al. [17] are examples of this
hash rate-based approach. Sedlmeir et al. [7] undertake a basic
comparison of diﬀerent DLT architectures with the conclusion
that the energy consumption diﬀers signiﬁcantly depending on
the design chosen. A further study by the same authors [18]
reﬁnes previous models for Bitcoin’s power consumption, such
as the one by Vranken [19], and emphasizes that the driving
forces behind power consumption are the Bitcoin price and the
availability of cheap electricity. Eshani et al. [20] use a linear
regression model to predict Ethereum’s energy consumption
based on the observed hash rate and diﬃculty level; however,
the use of simplistic interpolation techniques alone is likely
not an appropriate method for PoW blockchains [10]. Powell et

al. [21] derive a mathematical model for the energy consump-
tion of the PoS-based Polkadot blockchain by extrapolating
from the power demand of a single validator machine.

III. Systems reviewed

Our comparison set includes DLT systems with high market
capitalization that share a critical common denominator: using
a PoS-based consensus algorithm. In PoS, validators with
a higher stake – often in the form of the DLT system’s
native currency – inﬂuence the transaction validation more.
Thus, the scarce resource of energy to avoid Sybil attacks
in PoW is replaced by the scarce resource of capital in the
cryptocurrency [7]. Despite the commonalities, these systems
diﬀer in a range of other aspects, such as the minimum
thresholds to validate and delegate, the necessity to lock-up
tokens in order to stake (“bonding”), and the architecture
of incentives consisting of penalties (“slashing”) and rewards
beyond transaction fees (“block rewards”) (cf. Table II).

When it comes to energy consumption, however, diﬀerences
in the accounting model, transaction validation mechanism,
and node permissioning setting (cf. Table I), together with the
architectural design of each system’s speciﬁc PoS protocol,
are of particular relevance. In this section, we describe each
of the PoS-based systems with a focus on those aspects. A full
exploration of all possible factors is beyond the scope of this
paper.

Ethereum 2.0: Ethereum is a highly popular permis-
sionless blockchain that is currently transitioning from PoW
(Ethereum 1.0) to PoS (Ethereum 2.0). In Ethereum 1.0, every
full node needs to store all 350 GB of current state data.2
However, the storage of the full history of all transactions is
used by archive nodes only. There are also light nodes storing
only the header chains and requesting everything else from
a full node on which they depend.3 The sharding proposal
(Ethereum 2.0 Phase 1), designed to limit compute, storage,
and bandwidth needs, is not yet active.

Algorand: Algorand is a permissionless, account-based
system where relay nodes store the entire ledger and non-
relay nodes store approximately 1,000 blocks. A proposal to
limit storage needs through transaction expiration and sharding
(“Vault”) is not yet active [22].

Cardano: Cardano is also permissionless and the only
unspent transaction output (UTXO)-based system in our com-
transactions ever
parison set. In Cardano, nodes store all
made. Its proposal for sidechains and sharding (“Basho”) is
not yet active. There is a probability of being selected as
block-proposer for an epoch weighted by stake. However, it is
possible to delegate the stake to a stake pool, whose manager
receives rewards when the pool is selected and then shares
them with the delegators. Rewards are diminishing with the
pool size if a pool is so large that it exceeds a saturation
parameter. Non-selected stakers verify proposed blocks [23].

3https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/

Polkadot: In Polkadot’s permissionless nominated proof-
of-stake (NPoS), each node can delegate stake to up to 16
validators, among which the stake is always divided equally.
Rewards to validators are proportionate to validation work,
not to their stake. Polkadot also distinguishes between archive
nodes (storing all past blocks), full nodes (256 blocks), and
light nodes (storing only runtime and current state, but no past
blocks). The ﬁrst ﬁve shards (“parachains”) have been already
auctioned on the testnet “Kusama” but have not been deployed
in the main chain.
Tezos:

In Tezos’ permissionless liquid proof-of-stake
(LPoS), stake can also be delegated. Some delegates are block
producers, other delegates verify; both receive rewards for it
proportional to their stake [24]. Nodes have a “full mode”
storing the necessary data needed to reconstruct the complete
ledger state since the genesis block, but not contextual data
from a checkpoint onwards; an “archive mode” where all
blockchain data since the genesis block including contextual
data such as past balances or staking rights beyond the
checkpoints are stored; and “rolling mode” that only stores
the minimal data that is necessary to validate blocks.

Hedera:

In contrast to the other ﬁve systems studied,
Hedera is permissioned network that uses a directed acyclic
graph (DAG)-based data structure to store the transaction
history (cf. Table I) and applies PoS [25]. The network has
its consensus nodes run solely by its council members at
the moment, with the plan to open up to permissionless
nodes in the future4. Transactions do not form blocks, but are
spread through a “gossip about gossip” protocol where new
information obtained by any node is spread exponentially fast
though the network [26]. The consensus calculation takes the
form of a weighted average of all gossiping nodes’ information
such as transaction order, with the weight proportionate to a
node’s stake.

IV. Method

Our model diﬀers from previous work (cf. Section II) in
that we focus on the energy consumption per transaction,
as opposed to the overall energy consumption of an entire
system. Nevertheless, existing models can be combined with
additional data arising from the scientiﬁc literature, reports,
and public ledger information to form a baseline that can
be used to avoid time-consuming experimental validation.

Table II
Properties of the PoS protocols used for Sybil attack resistance in
the DLT systems analyzed

Powell et al. [21] deﬁne an elementary mathematical model
for the energy consumption of the Polkadot blockchain that
can be generalized as

𝑝𝑡 = 𝑝 · 𝑛val,

(1)

where 𝑝𝑡 is the overall average power the DLT system con-
sumes, 𝑝 is average power consumed by a validator node, and
𝑛val is the number of validator nodes. Due to the comparatively
low computational eﬀort associated with PoS and the intention-
ally relatively low throughput of permissionless blockchains to
avoid centralization because of compute, bandwidth, or storage
constraints [27], it can be assumed that validating nodes run
on similar types of commodity server hardware, irrespective
of the network load.

Under this assumption, the overall energy need of such a
protocol is solely contingent on the number and hardware
conﬁguration of validator nodes. In the context of this pa-
per, we only consider the energy footprint of the consensus
mechanisms itself. We, therefore, only consider validators5,
i.e., nodes that actively participate in a network’s consensus
mechanism by submitting and verifying the proofs necessary
for Sybil attack resistance [1]. The overall number of nodes,
including other full nodes that replicate the transaction history
without participating in consensus, is likely higher for all
systems analyzed. A key model parameter, therefore, is the
number of validator machines running concurrently (𝑛val). This
number can be established reliably, since it is stored on-chain
as a key aspect of any PoS-based protocol. Table III shows
the number of validators currently operating on each of the
networks considered.

Energy consumption per transaction: To arrive at an
energy consumption per transaction metric (𝑐tx), the number
of transactions per unit of time needs to be considered. The
actual numbers are dynamic and ﬂuctuate over time. The
contemporary network throughput (Cont.) is deﬁned as the
actual throughput a system experienced recently. As a key
this can be derived from approximate timestamps
metric,
that are associated with transactions on public ledgers. The
maximum postulated sustainable system throughput (Max.) of
the diﬀerent protocols is derived from casual sources (cf.
Appendix B). Note that these postulated ﬁgures are likely
optimistic, that means, not necessarily reliable, as they orig-
inate not from controlled experiments but are anecdotal or
come from promotional materials. However, we consider these
estimates acceptable as they have no direct inﬂuence on the
energy consumption per transaction for a ﬁxed contemporary
network throughput. They merely dictate the domain of the
consumption function 𝑓𝑐tx (𝑙) that calculates the consumption
per transaction depending on the overall system throughput 𝑙
(measured in tx/s). Treating the average power consumed by
a validator node (𝑝, measured in W) as a constant means that
an inverse relationship between consumption per transaction
(𝑐tx) and system throughput (𝑙) can be established within the
bounds of (0, 𝑙max]:

𝑓𝑐tx (𝑙) = 𝑛val · 𝑝

𝑙

.

(2)

Modelling 𝑐tx as a function of the number of transactions
per second: Equation (2) depends on two variables: 𝑛val and 𝑙.
We will now present a model for 𝑐tx that depends on one vari-
able, namely 𝑙, only. Data from the Cardano blockchain [28]
suggests that the number of validators 𝑛val and the number
of transactions per second 𝑙 are positively correlated. Namely,
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient6 for 𝑛val and 𝑙 for 375 data
points from 29 Jul 2020 to 7 Aug 2021 is 0.80. The correlation
coeﬃcient for 𝑛val delayed by 28 days and 𝑙 (not delayed)
for the same data is 0.87. This is plausible for the following
reason: as the total number of users in a permissionless system
increases, a share of these new users becomes validators and
another non-disjoint share executes transactions, meaning that
𝑛val and 𝑙 are positively correlated. For permissioned systems,
it is still conceivable that the number of validators and through-
put are linearly dependent and positively correlated because as
new partner organizations are invited to run validator nodes,
these partners may decide to use the system for their own
applications, thereby increasing the number of transactions.
We also observe that
the number
of validators and throughput are positively correlated: the
number of validator nodes has been continuously increasing;
and throughput, while ﬂuctuating from month to month, has
increased year-to-year (cf. Appendix A). Furthermore, it can
be observed for the Algorand and Hedera blockchains that
𝑛val and 𝑙 have increased from July to August 2021. On the
Polkadot blockchain, 𝑛val has remained constant from February

in the case of Hedera,

6The correlation coeﬃcient takes values in [−1, 1] and a value of ±1 would

imply that 𝑛val is an aﬃne function in 𝑙.

to July 2021. An exception is the Tezos blockchain for which
𝑛val has decreased while 𝑙 has increased from February to
August 2021. This trend has so far held true throughout the
lifetime of the Tezos blockchain. We note that in this case an
aﬃne function is not appropriate to model the dependence of
𝑛val on 𝑙, because 𝑛val would become negative for large values
of 𝑙. We will still compute the aﬃne best approximation of 𝑛val
in terms of 𝑙 for the Tezos blockchain, as it is an approximation
of the ﬁrst Taylor polynomial of 𝑛val, and therefore a local
model for 𝑛val.

.

𝑙

For simplicity we assume that the correlation is perfect, i.e.,
𝑛val = 𝜅 + 𝜆 · 𝑙 for some 𝜅, 𝜆 ∈ R, 𝜆 > 0, and using (2) we
obtain
𝑓𝑐tx (𝑙) = (𝜅 + 𝜆𝑙) · 𝑝
Because we could not obtain high-resolution historic data
for Algorand, Polkadot, Tezos, and Hedera, we will later on
compute 𝜅, 𝜆 based on two data points. For Cardano, we
use linear regression implemented as ordinary least squares
regression to compute 𝜅, 𝜆 that have the maximum likelihood
of modelling 𝑓𝑐tx (𝑙) under the assumption that
𝑓𝑐tx (𝑙) is an
aﬃne function with Gaussian noise. The resulting values for
𝜅, 𝜆 can be found in Table IV.

Hardware Type and Compute Resource Utilization Con-
siderations: In stark contrast to energy-intensive PoW systems,
in PoS, the computational eﬀort relating to the participation in
the consensus protocol can practically be considered indepen-
dent of extraneous factors like cryptocurrency capitalization.
Numerous factors inﬂuence the overall energy consumption of
a server with central processing unit (CPU) activity, hard disk
drive operations and cooling contributing most signiﬁcantly to
it [29]. Consensus-related energy demand in PoS is generally
constant, meaning it occurs irrespective of system load [29].
Energy demand relating to CPU time and input/output op-
erations is, however, highly load-dependent [30]. Therefore,
a realistic energy consumption estimate for a validator node
needs to factor in both the minimum hardware requirement
(i.e., how many CPU cores or what amount of memory is
required) as well as the utilization of that hardware.

Since it is close to impossible to determine which type
of hardware is used by validators in actuality, we use an
approximation derived from industry recommendations. For
permissionless systems and permissioned systems dramatically
diﬀerent hardware recommendations are put forward. The
permissionless systems analyzed in this study, all traditional

blockchains with comparatively large numbers of validators
running full nodes that verify every transaction [27], demand
comparatively low-powered hardware. Hedera, the only permis-
sioned system analyzed here, constitutes a high-transactions
per second (tps) system. Such systems are characterized by a
small number of nodes maintains consensus [27]. As such, the
network performance is determined by the lowest-performing
validator node7. Therefore,
in order to achieve the postu-
lated maximum throughput values, highly performant server
hardware is demanded by the network operator. We assumed
that similar high-tps systems would have energy requirements
in the same range. This explains the diﬀerence in energy
consumption per validator node between Hedera and the other
traditional Blockchain systems.

Conceivable upper and lower bounds for the power demand of a

To capture the uncertainty regarding appropriate hardware
and expected hardware utilization in the model, three diﬀer-
ent validator conﬁgurations are considered (cf. Table V): a
single-board computer, a general-purpose rackmount server
for midsize and large enterprises, and a high-performance
server. For all conﬁgurations, hardware utilization based on
typical workloads is assumed (cf. Appendix C). For traditional
blockchains, we assume a power demand in the minimum to
medium range (5.5 W to 168.1 W). For high-tps systems, the
medium to maximum range (168.1 W to 328 W) is assumed.

V. Results

Table VI illustrates the application of the models described
in (2) and (3) to estimate the energy consumption of the pro-
tocols considered under contemporary throughput, i.e., based
on recent throughput measures (cf. Section IV). To facilitate
a broad overview, we also provide the global system-wide
consumption of each DLT system according to the model.
Furthermore, the table presents two estimates for energy con-
sumption per DLT system: an optimistic estimate assuming
validator nodes are operated on the lower bound of the system
range and a pessimistic estimate that assumes validators utilize
hardware on the higher bound (cf. Table V). As the merge
of Ethereum mainnet with the beacon chain is outstanding,
no contemporary throughput ﬁgures for Ethereum 2.0 can be
established. Instead, a broad projection between a lower bound,
the current throughput of the Ethereum blockchain (15.40 tx/s),

7https://docs.hedera.com/guides/mainnet/mainnet-nodes/node-requirements

and an upper bound, the postulated maximum value following
the merge (3 ktx/s), is presented (cf. Appendix B).

All estimates are based on the validator counts established
earlier (cf. Section IV). The plot of the model function shown
in Figure 1 visualizes the inverse relationship described earlier
within the boundaries of the postulated throughput values (cf.
Table III). It also provides a projection of energy consumption
as a function of system load, based on the model presented
earlier which predicts the number of validators as a function
of system load. This projection is equally illustrated within the
boundaries of the postulated throughput values, except in the
case of the Tezos Blockchain for which no global model could
be derived.

Based on this data, we can compare the energy consumption
per transaction on two related systems: ﬁrst the PoW cryp-
tocurrency Bitcoin and second the VisaNet payment network
(Figure 1). It becomes evident that the consumption of Bitcoin
– overall and per-transaction – is at
three orders of
magnitude higher than that of the highest consuming PoS
system even under the most favorable assumptions. While
the diﬀerence between PoS systems and VisaNet
is less
pronounced, it is evident that most of the former undercut
the energy consumption of VisaNet in most conﬁgurations.

Table VI
Global power consumption (i.e. the network-wide consumption of the
DLT systems under consideration and VisaNet) and the energy
consumed per transaction for contemporary throughput (see Table III)

Pronounced diﬀerences between PoS-based systems are
equally evident from the results. We observe low energy
demand per transaction in active permissioned DLT systems
that are characterized by comparatively small numbers of
validators and high throughput. Less active permissionless
systems show a higher energy demand per transaction due
to comparatively lower throughput and a high number of
validators. This illustrates that not only for PoW [31] but also
for PoS blockchains, “energy consumption per transaction”
should not be the only metric considered for assessing the
sustainability. Particularly when utility is not approximately
proportional to throughput, total energy consumption may be
a more appropriate key ﬁgure.

Throughput [tx/s]

Figure 1. The energy consumption per transaction is close to inversely correlated with throughput. For each system, the lower mark indicates the energy
consumption under an optimistic validator hardware assumption while the upper mark indicates a pessimistic model. The consumption ﬁgures for Bitcoin and
VisaNet are plotted for comparison (cf. Appendix D). For Ethereum 2.0, no throughput metrics are available.

VI. Discussion

A. Interpretations

These results can primarily be understood as a clear conﬁr-
mation of the common opinion that the energy consumption of
PoW systems, especially Bitcoin, is excessive. Therefore, they
can be interpreted as a strong argument for the modernization
of PoW-based systems towards PoS. Ethereum is taking a
commendable lead in this respect with the development of
Ethereum 2.0. Furthermore, the results indicate that the energy
consumption of diﬀerent non-PoW blockchains is surprisingly
divergent (e.g., by a factor of about 1 × 103 between the PoS
system with the highest consumption and the one with the
lowest). In absolute terms, however, the consumption rates of
PoS-based systems are moderate and thus also much closer to
the ﬁgures for traditional, centralized payment systems such
as VisaNet.

The main reason why our model yields considerable di-
vergence between PoS systems is the diﬀerent number of
validators. Speciﬁcally, in permissioned systems, energy con-
sumption can be controlled through the ability to limit the
number of validators on a network, so the permissioned
network analyzed in this study is characterized by low energy
consumption. However,
this observation does not warrant
conclusions such as that permissioned systems are necessarily
less energy consumptive. Moreover, while in permissioned
systems an operator can inﬂuence the number of nodes, it
does not necessarily mean that that number must be lower.

Even if a reducing eﬀect of permissioning on energy con-
sumption could be stated with certainty, this should not be
misinterpreted as an argument for increased centralization or
an argument for permissioned networks over permissionless
ones. This becomes obvious when considering a permissioned

DLT system in extremis: such a system would consist of
only a single validator node and would thus be eﬀectively
centralized. This hypothetical scenario shows that, if a per-
missioned paradigm is applied, close attention should be
paid to system entry barriers enforced through gatekeeping
capabilities. If not, there is a risk of centralization, which
may oﬀer advantages in terms of energy consumption, but will
negate the functional advantages of a decentralized paradigm.
Of practical relevance is also the result that the selection of
suitable validator hardware is central to energy consumption.
Information regarding adequate hardware for validators is often
inconsistent. Therefore, standardized recommendations should
be put forward to help operators of validator nodes in selecting
the most energy-eﬃcient hardware conﬁguration.

This study is only a ﬁrst step towards quantifying the energy
consumption of PoS systems. However, despite its limitations,
it gives impetus to designers of decentralized systems by
load,
revealing the dependency between validator number,
and hardware conﬁguration. Our model can thus be used to
determine the carbon footprint of a particular use case. It can
furthermore prompt operators of validator nodes to carefully
select suitable hardware.

B. Limitations

So far, we have used broad consumption ranges to model
the energy consumption of individual validator nodes. While
we are conﬁdent that the actual energy consumption is in
fact within these ranges, underlying characteristics of diﬀerent
PoS protocols that might impact energy consumption, such
as the accounting model, have been ignored. Second, while
assuming that the electricity consumption of a validator node
is independent of system throughput is well justiﬁed for the per-
missionless systems analyzed [27], permissioned systems that

are designed to support high throughput may not warrant such
assumption. While we have accounted for this by assuming
more powerful hardware for permissionless hightps systems,
more work is needed to understand permissioned blockchains’
energy consumption characteristics better. Moreover, the im-
pact of diﬀerent workloads on energy consumption should be
considered; for example, simple payments transactions may
have lower computational requirements when compared to
other smart contract calls, but so far we have not distinguished
between transaction types.

Further, while our model suggests that PoS systems can
remain energy-eﬃcient while scaling up to VisaNet throughput
levels, there is no hard evidence in support of this argument,
as no DLT-based system has experienced a sustained volume
of this magnitude to date on the base level.

We ignored the possibility of achieving eﬀectively higher
throughput than the speciﬁed maximum through layer 2 (L2)
solutions, such as the Lightning network or via optimistic
and zero-knowledge (zk)-rollups that are receiving increasing
attention.

Finally, although there are reasons to support its plausibility,
the assumption that an aﬃne function can be used to express
the number of validators in terms of throughput is questionable.
While we assume that it is applicable to Hedera, this might
not be a justiﬁable assumption for other permissioned settings.
The applicability of this model to other permissioned systems
should therefore be more formally analyzed.

VII. Conclusion

The increasing popularity of DLT systems since the in-
vention of Bitcoin, and with it
the energy-intensive PoW
consensus mechanism, has produced a variety of alternative
mechanisms. PoS is a particularly popular alternative that is
commonly assumed to be more energy eﬃcient than PoW.
In this paper, we tested this hypothesis using a mathematical
consumption model that predicts expected energy consumption
per transaction, as a function of network load. Applying this
model to six diﬀerent PoS-based DLT systems supports the
hypothesis and suggests that their energy consumption per
transaction is indeed at least two to three orders of magnitude
lower than that of Bitcoin. Furthermore, we discover signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences among the analyzed PoS-based systems them-
selves. Here, a permissioned system was found to consume
signiﬁcantly less energy per transaction than permissionless
systems. This diﬀerence could be attributed to gatekeeping
capabilities oﬀered by permissioned systems.

These results can be understood as an urgent call for the
modernization of PoW systems and a shift
towards PoS,
as well as a recommendation to practitioners to consider
appropriate, energy-saving hardware. They are also intended to
provide a basis for the future comparative study of the energy
friendliness of PoS systems and to facilitate the development
of more rigorous consumption models. Given the enormous
challenges posed by climate change, avoiding unnecessary
energy consumption needs to be a high priority. Our work
shows that PoS-based systems can contribute to this and could

even undercut the energy needs of traditional central payment
systems, raising hopes that DLT can contribute positively to
combatting climate change.

Future research should further develop and conﬁrm these
initial ﬁndings by improving the sophistication of the model
and considering factors beyond network throughput, that may
inﬂuence validator count. It should, furthermore, consider the
network-wide energy consumption beyond validator nodes (i.e.,
by including all full nodes and auxiliary services) to arrive
at a more holistic view of the overall energy consumption
of DLT systems. Applying benchmarking frameworks [32] to
measure the actual energy consumption might be particularly
worthwhile in the context of permissioned systems that aim for
high performance. In addition, analyzing the actual hardware
conﬁgurations, instead of relying on rough estimates, might
prove a worthwhile extension. Finally, future work should
assess the eﬀects of moving from a permissioned to a per-
missionless model.
