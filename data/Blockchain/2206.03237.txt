Abstract. Blockchain has been proposed to facilitate the enactment
of interorganisational business processes. For such processes, blockchain
can guarantee the enforcement of rules and the integrity of execution
traces—without the need for a centralised trusted party. However, the
enactment of interorganisational processes pose manifold challenges. In
this work, we ask what answers the research ﬁeld oﬀers in response to
those challenges. To do so, we conduct a systematic literature review
(SLR). As our guiding question, we investigate the guarantees and capa-
bilities of blockchain-based enactment approaches. Based on this SLR,
we develop a taxonomy for blockchain-based enactment. We ﬁnd that a
wide range of approaches support traceability and correctness; however,
research focusing on ﬂexibility and scalability remains nascent. For all
challenges, we point towards future research opportunities.

1 Introduction

The enactment of a process is a central part of the business process man-
agement (BPM) lifecycle. Enactment comprises instantiation, execution, and
monitoring of a process [1, Chapter 1.2]. Business process management sys-
tems (BPMS), also known as workﬂow management systems, have long been
used in intraorganisational processes to automate the enactment of business
processes [1, Chapter 2.4][2, Chapter 9.1.2]. However, in an inter organisational
setting, without central control, this is far more complex. To capture the com-
plexity surrounding multiple autonomous distributed actors, Breu et al. denote
such processes as living. Such processes, they argue, make traceability, scalability,
ﬂexibility, and correctness aspects far more challenging to address [3]. Similarly,
Pourmirza et al. ﬁnd that only 30% of BPMS consider interorganisational as-
pects. For these systems, the “autonomy of organisations” becomes an issue.
This requires trust mechanisms, dynamism, and ﬂexibility. Furthermore, they
identify standardization and interoperability issues [4]. In this setting, block-
chain has been proposed to serve as a neutral ground between participants, by
facilitating trust and enforcing conformance and integrity—without the intro-
duction of a centralised trusted party [5]. In this work, we ask what answers the

research ﬁeld of blockchain-based enactment oﬀers in response to the challenges
posed by interorganisational challenges. To do so, we develop a taxonomy ca-
pable of describing and classifying blockchain-based enactment approaches. We
derive this taxonomy from a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR),
based on 36 selected primary studies. We ﬁnd that, while blockchain is a natural
ﬁt to ensure traceability and correctness of process execution, research focus-
ing on ﬂexibility and scalability remains nascent. For all challenges, we point
out possible future research directions. Following open science principles, and to
enable replicability, we make the data from our SLR available—see Footnote 2.

1.1 Blockchain-Based Business Process Enactment

In an interorganisational setting, process control crosses organisational bound-
aries. Without central control, properties such as traceability or correctness are
hard to address, e.g., how to ensure integrity and availability of event data across
organisations, or how to enforce control-ﬂow when control is distributed [3]. With
central control, the question arises which party is to host a hub or mediator com-
ponent, i.e., a centralised trusted party must be introduced [5]. Blockchain tech-
nology can distribute this trust by oﬀering “a single logically-centralised ledger
of cryptocurrency transactions operated in an organisationally-decentralised and
physically-distributed way” [6, p. 7]. The blockchain’s ledger is in practice im-
mutable, non-repudiable, fully transparent, and highly available [7, Chapter 5].
Smart contracts can be used to perform arbitrary computations on the block-
chain. As conceptualized in the ﬁrst work in the ﬁeld [5], blockchain can assume
control of the process, enforcing or monitoring process rules and providing an
immutable process trace.

1.2 Related Work

Pourmirza et al. [4] presented a SLR of BPMS architectures; they have found that
only 30% consider interorganisational aspects. Mendling et al. [8] formulated the
possibilities and challenges of blockchain for BPM. Their seminal work can be
seen as charting the research direction in BPM and blockchain. For enactment,
they discussed the approach as outlined in Weber et al. [5]. Di Ciccio et al. [9]
discussed the possibilities of business process monitoring using blockchain, which
is part of the enactment lifecycle. For blockchain and BPM as a whole, Garcia-
Garcia et al. [10] conducted a SLR investigating blockchain support for the
diﬀerent BPM lifecycles. In contrast, we present a taxonomy and classiﬁcation
of enactment approaches. This allows us to provide in-depth analysis speciﬁc
to enactment. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to
present a SLR and taxonomy on blockchain-based business process enactment.

2 Methodology

A taxonomy is a classiﬁcation system that produces groupings of objects based
on common characteristics [11]. Such a classiﬁcation is integral to scientiﬁc

Blockchain for Business Process Enactment – Taxonomy and SLR

method. In a complex ﬁeld, a taxonomy can facilitate understanding and anal-
ysis. It can help navigate the research ﬁeld and identify research gaps. In the
ﬁeld of design science, Williams et al. [12] note that the classiﬁcation of diﬀer-
ences provides insights into the design—and design process—of artefacts. For
taxonomy development, we follow the deﬁnitions and guidelines as outlined in
Nickerson et al. [11]. A taxonomy has diﬀerent dimensions that can be derived
inductively (i.e., empirically) or deductively (i.e., conceptually). Induction re-
quires empirical evidence (i.e., cases to investigate), while deduction requires
sound knowledge to deduce dimensions through logical reasoning. Nickerson et
al. recommend the application of both methods in an iterative manner. We did
so, but relied mostly on induction. To collect empirical evidence, we conducted
a SLR of the ﬁeld as per Kitchenham et al. [13], interleaved with the methods
outlined by Nickerson et al. for taxonomy development. That is, the identiﬁed
primary studies were used to inductively derive our taxonomy. Afterwards, we
classiﬁed our primary studies according to the taxonomy.

2.1 Taxonomy Development

Following Nickerson et al. [11], at ﬁrst, we have deﬁned the users, purpose, and
the meta-charateristic for our taxonomy. As users, we identiﬁed design science
researchers. For these researchers, the purpose of this taxonomy is to enable
the assessment of the current state of the art and future research opportuni-
ties. More speciﬁcally, which challenges of interorganisational processes have
been solved by integrating blockchain, and which are still unaddressed. A meta-
characteristic is the most general and complete characteristic from which all
dimensions are derived [11]. This characteristic can be thought of as the starting
point for taxonomy development. Our meta-characteristic is comprised of the
guarantees and capabilities of blockchain-based process enactment. Distributing
trust is the central reason for introducing blockchain technology to process enact-
ment. Blockchain establishes trust by providing certain guarantees, such as the
immutability of the ledger. Therefore, the oﬀered guarantees were of central in-
terest to our research. In addition, we investigated the capabilities of approaches,
such as resource allocation and process ﬂexibility. The meta-characteristic also
served as the guiding research question for our SLR.

2.2 Systematic Literature Review

Through early exploratory searches, we could not deduce a concise common
terminology for blockchain-based business process enactment. Thus, we decided
to conduct a search with a set of broad search keywords, connecting terms of
business process management with blockchain, and then apply more restrictive
exclusion criteria. To limit the search results (given that blockchain constitutes
a buzzword mentioned in many works), we restricted the search to the title of
studies. The search string is presented in Listing 1.

singular and plural versions of each search keyword.

AND

To account for the fast research pace in which blockchain is evolving, we also con-
sidered pre-prints and conference papers. There is evidence that Google Scholar 1
performs especially well in such scenarios [14], which made it our tool of choice.
The initial search was conducted on the 2022-03-10 and yielded 186 entries. A
full list of applied inclusion and exclusion criteria is given in Table 1 below.
In the ﬁrst pass, we excluded works based on publication type and title; in
the second we examined the abstract. Finally, we conducted a full reading. Af-
ter applying our exclusion criteria, we obtained 30 studies. We then performed
backward snowballing. To limit the scope of the study, we did not conduct a full
forward snowballing. Due to our broad search keywords, we expected forward
snowballing to only yield a large set of irrelevant or already reviewed studies. We
conﬁrmed this expectation for our two most cited primary studies, and indeed
found no relevant additional studies. Trough backward snowballing, we obtained
an additional six studies, leading to a ﬁnal primary study set of 36 studies. The
full process, each pass, and the application of the exclusion criteria is made
transparent in our published data set.2

3 A Taxonomy of Blockchain-Based Enactment

3.1 Overview

By investigating our primary studies and following the methodology as per
Section 2, we arrived at the taxonomy depicted in Figure 1. When assessing
blockchain-based applications, it is important to diﬀerentiate between application-
speciﬁc properties and properties inherited from the employed blockchain. In our
taxonomy, dimensions are kept independent from the chosen blockchain; this al-
lows an independent assessment. The decision which blockchain platform to use
is a diﬀerent, but interrelated design decision [7, Chapter 6.3]. We have struc-
tured our taxonomy into supported capabilities and enforced guarantees. To
improve readability, we defer the detailed introduction of our dimensions to the
presentation of our classiﬁcation results in Section 3.2. For capabilities, we cap-
ture with model support, which notation was chosen to represent the business
process; with resource allocation capability, we diﬀerentiate between resource
allocation strategies; with process ﬂexibility capability, we capture how studies
approach ﬂexibility. For enforcement, we ﬁnd that control-ﬂow, resource alloca-
tion, and data-integrity aspects are enforced on-chain. Given the prevalence of
control-ﬂow, we subdivide this aspect further (See Section 3.2 below).

3.2 Dimensions and Classiﬁcation Results

We detail the dimensions of our taxonomy and present the results of the classi-
ﬁcation our our primary studies.

Capabilities. First, we explore the supported capabilities, which are sum-
marised in Table 2.

Model Support. The vast majority (70%) of studies are BPMN based. Notably,
there is no close second. In terms of BPMN, 13 studies support the process, eight
the choreography, and four the collaboration diagram.

Table 2. Classiﬁcation of capabilities.

Resource Allocation. Resource allocation assigns a process resource to a task [2,
Chapter 10.5]. In blockchain-based enactment, a resource is typically identiﬁed
by a blockchain account address. As blockchain transactions must be signed, a
resource’s involvement in a task cannot be repudiated (assuming the secrecy of
their private key). 21 studies support resource allocation in general. Of these,
we can diﬀerentiate between direct (ﬁve studies) and role-based (13 studies). A
direct allocation binds a blockchain address directly to a task. Role-based allo-
cation allows some indirection by assigning addresses to roles and roles to tasks.
Only three allow a more dynamic strategy, which was ﬁrst presented in [17].
These dynamic variants allow to specify the conditions for resource allocation
in a so-called binding policy. For a given role, a participant can be nominated.
Constraints can require that a participant must (or must not) already be bound
to certain other roles. Endorsement constraints specify when and which other
participants can vote on a nomination.

Process Flexibility. Process ﬂexibility is essential for supporting less predictable
processes. Reichert et al. characterised four ﬂexibility needs: variability, loose-
ness, adaptation, and evolution [50, Chapter 3]. We ﬁnd that only ﬁve studies
support ﬂexibility needs. Looseness is supported by three studies. Two [47, 49]
support looseness by using declarative models; these are loosely speciﬁed, pro-
viding more ﬂexibility by only modelling constraints [50, Chapter 12]. L´opez-
Pintado et al. [21] support looseness and adaptation. Their approach allows late
modelling: subprocesses can be modelled during run time. Furthermore, certain
process elements can be adapted during run time. This is accompanied by an
agreement policy, which allows to specify the participants that are allowed to
adapt process elements and the conditions that must be met. For the adapted
process, they can guarantee deadlock freeness. Klinger et al. [35] support process
evolution. They implement blockchain design patterns (registry and proxy pat-

Blockchain for Business Process Enactment – Taxonomy and SLR

terns) that enable the versioning of processes. These patterns decouple logic from
data and allow logic to be updated. The approach includes a voting mechanism,
which allows participants to vote on new process versions.

Enforcement Guarantees. Diﬀerent perspectives of a process can be enforced
on the blockchain. We ﬁnd that control-ﬂow, data-integrity, and resource alloca-
tion are enforced on-chain. Table 3 gives an overview of our classiﬁcation result.
We can observe a clear focus on control-ﬂow enforcement (31 studies) over mon-
itoring (5 studies).3 Control-ﬂow enforcement can be data-based (15 studies)
or event-based (16 studies). Data-based enforcement enables, based on instance
data, the evaluation of gateway conditions to automatically allow or disallow
certain branches in the model. Event-based enforcement, on the other hand, can
only enforce the semantics of the gateway (e.g., branching semantics of AND or
XOR gateways), but not evaluate dynamic conditions.

Additionally, public blockchains enable the enforcement of token transfers
(six studies). That is, certain behaviour may prompt automatic transfer of crypto
tokens. Beyond fungible tokens (ﬁve studies), only Lu et al. [18] support the
modelling and transfer of non-fungible tokens, which are integral for asset man-
agement.

Finally, only Ladleif et al. [28] and Abid et al. [27] allow to enforce temporal
constraints. These constraints are based on the block timestamp. A blockchain
network has no strong notion of a synchronised clock, the close world assumption
and the transaction-driven nature of blockchain do not allow to access external
time information or to continuously monitor an internal clock [51]. The block
timestamp is the only readily available traditional notion of time on the chain; it
is, however, of limited accuracy and can—to a certain extend—be manipulated
by the block creator [51].

We listed 21 studies that support the allocation of resources to tasks. Most
studies (19 studies) enforce this allocation by implementing authorisation mech-
anisms: only the allocated blockchain address can perform the task. In contrast,
Prybila et al. [30] and Meroni et al. [49] present monitoring approaches that only
guarantee the authenticity of the resource that has performed the task, they do
not enforce authorisation. Lastly, all approaches make use of the integrity guar-
antee of blockchain to store the process trace. 27 studies allow the storage of
instance data and ﬁve store a serialised version of the (original) process model
on the blockchain.

Methods. Beyond our taxonomy, we investigate the evaluation methods em-
ployed. A summary is presented in Table 4. Most works evaluate their approach
using Ethereum (24 studies). Nine studies use Hyperledger Fabric. Four present
a custom blockchain implementation and only two studies consider Bitcoin. Fi-
nally, Corradini et al. [34] and Falazi et al. [26] present artefacts for multiple
blockchains. In terms of evaluation, cost is the most frequently regarded metric
(23 studies). For ten studies, cost is the sole focus of the evaluation.

3 We deﬁne monitoring as approaches where the control-ﬂow is not enforced, but the
process trace is still committed to the blockchain to ensure the integrity of the trace.

Indeed, this concern is understandable when considering the cost of public block-
chain compared to more traditional computing [52]. Most (19 studies out of 23)
report cost based on Ethereum gas4. Transaction fees on Ethereum have in-
creased signiﬁcantly along with the popularity of the network. While Weber et
al. [5] were still able to conduct evaluation experiments on the main network
of Ethereum, more recent works resort to test networks or private deployments.
We show this development in Figure 2, where we compare publication year and
execution cost for a repeated instance execution, excluding the cost that only
incur once (e.g., deployment or conﬁguration). As a point, we depict the original
cost in US$ at the time of publication. This price is based on the average gas
cost and exchange rate of the publication year.5 The point is connected vertically
with a triangle, which represents the cost the same execution would incur taken

the average gas cost and exchange rate of 2021. We can observe that the cost
has risen signiﬁcantly over time. The result is a projected mean cost of $1010
for a singular instance run in 2021. No approach would lie signiﬁcantly below
$100 for one run. As a result, most recent works argue for the use of a private
network in almost all scenarios.

Besides cost, 18 studies discuss qualitative aspects (e.g., privacy or trust) and
nine studies evaluate the correctness of their approach. For correctness, they in-
vestigate whether non-conforming traces are prevented (enforcing approaches)
or detected (monitoring approaches) correctly.6 Notably, ﬁnality7 and through-
put are only investigated by three studies each. Lastly, 18 studies have published
their code and eleven have made a replication package available.

4 Discussion: Challenges and Future Research Directions

We discuss the guarantees and capabilities of blockchain-based enactment in the
light of the challenges of interorganisational processes (see Section 1): interop-
erability [4], traceability, scalability, ﬂexibility, and correctness [3].

4.1 Interoperability

Blockchain can facilitate interoperability, as participants share the same execu-
tion environment. Based on our review, we can observe two opportunities for
future research: supporting the data perspective, and cross-chain compatibility.

6 We here need to remark that [25] is not handling the claimed subset of BPMN

correctly; as noted in [16, Sect. 2.2], the OR join is handled incorrectly.

7 We consider ﬁnality as the time it takes a transaction to be durably committed with

a certain probability e.

Data perspective. A shared understanding of data is essential for participants;
for example, to connect the local data model or assess security and privacy
implications [53]. Thus, the data perspective needs to be suitably modelled. All
approaches, with the notable exception of Lu et al. [18], which use a UML class
diagram to model non-fungible-tokens, require blockchain-speciﬁc code snippets
(e.g., solidity code) to express data types or data-based gateway conditions. In
the future, we envision the integration of more comprehensive and platform-
independent data models.

Cross-chain compatibility. Only [26, 34] present artefacts for multiple block-
chains. However, the choice of the blockchain platform is application-speciﬁc [7,
Chapter 6.3]. In terms of cross-chain compatibility, we envision three lines of
research. First, when and how are multi-chain deployments a suitable implemen-
tation choice, and which basic requirements arise (e.g., cross-chain guarantees
on integrity)? Second, the creation of artefacts for diﬀerent blockchain platforms
from one process model. Third, as discussed in [54], the execution of parts of the
same process instance on diﬀerent blockchain platforms.

4.2 Traceability & Correctness

Blockchain is a natural ﬁt to ensure traceability and correctness of execution.
Event data stored on the blockchain ledger is immutable and globally traceable.
The integrity of this data can be enforced without introducing a centralised
trusted party. To ensure correctness, the model-driven engineering paradigm is
typically applied. This allows to generate well-tested artefacts following best
practices. Consequently, all approaches either enforce the control-ﬂow on-chain
or allow the monitoring of the control-ﬂow by committing the process trace to
the ledger. In the following, we outline two opportunities for future research:
dispute resolution and the extension of enforcement guarantees.

Dispute resolution. Based on the immutable process trace, blockchain is en-
visioned to enable the resolution of contractual disputes between process partic-
ipants (see e.g., [5]). However, no approach details a dispute resolution process,
nor is its facilitation supported. It is unclear in which state the process remains
once a dispute is raised. We expect that research conducted in this direction
could provide real beneﬁt to organisations. However, integrating the resolution
of disputes may prove to be challenging and require diﬀerent escalation lev-
els [55]. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether blockchain traces would be
accepted in a litigation process. A dispute resolution process could also include
incentive mechanisms, facilitating the honest behaviour of participants and pe-
nalising malicious behaviour. Such research, would have to be conducted in an
interdisciplinary context, including law and economic disciplines.

Enforcement guarantees. While control-ﬂow, resource allocation, and in-
tegrity aspects are supported, we expect that organisations would beneﬁt from
the blockchain-based enforcement of other process related rules. Our taxonomy

Blockchain for Business Process Enactment – Taxonomy and SLR

11

remains extensible to further enforcement dimensions. For example, resource al-
location is a complex decision problem into which many characteristics can be
factored in [2, Chapter 10.5]. Enforcing these rules on-chain would make the allo-
cation process transparent and globally enforceable. Currently, most works focus
on role-based allocation, but it remains intransparent why a certain participant
was allocated to a role.

Lastly, while most primary studies support on-chain enforcement, only nine
evaluate the correctness of this enforcement capability. A more stringent evalu-
ation, or even formal correctness proofs of the enforcement capability should be
a central concern for the ﬁeld, as this is the basis for all guarantees oﬀered.

4.3 Flexibility & Scalability

While traceability and correctness aspects are already well supported, enabling
ﬂexibility and scalability remains a challenge. We see three major research op-
portunities: controlled ﬂexibility, comprehensive performance studies, and en-
actment on public blockchains.

Controlled ﬂexibility. Only ﬁve studies address ﬂexibility challenges. Intro-
ducing ﬂexibility in blockchain applications is a challenge due to the ledger’s
immutability. Furthermore, introducing ﬂexibility capabilities may lead to trust
concerns and correctness issues [21]. Participants must be convinced that ﬂex-
ibility will not introduce uncertainties beyond their control, otherwise it will
undermine traceability and correctness guarantees. Recharting the development
of traditional enactment approaches, we can observe that the main focus, so far,
has been on predictable processes. Addressing the challenges surrounding un-
predictable processes and integrating diﬀerent techniques to support variability,
looseness, adaptation, and evolution [50]—but in a controlled manner—remains
a line for future research.

Comprehensive performance studies. Across all studies, the most promi-
nent evaluation goal is to demonstrate (low) gas cost. Gas cost can give an
indication on throughput scalability on a public or private blockchain. The no-
tion of gas has been introduced in Ethereum to calculate transaction fees. The
goal was to control network propagation and storage requirements.8 However,
other factors also play a crucial role. In our set of primary studies, scalability fac-
tors beyond gas cost are rarely explored. While a lot of performance properties
depend upon the underlying blockchain platform, many use cases, especially pri-
vate deployments, would beneﬁt from more comprehensive performance studies.
For example, in a private blockchain, with a few participants, gas cost may be
not of paramount importance. The choice and conﬁguration of a blockchain net-
work is a complex trade-oﬀ between diﬀerent parameters [7, Chapter 3] and can
be optimised for a speciﬁc use-case [7, Chapter 6.3]. We envision future work to

go beyond reporting gas cost and contribute to a discussion on the assumptions,
advantages and drawbacks of diﬀerent deployment options. Here, the question
remains what properties must be investigated for a speciﬁc use case and which
can be simulated or deduced from existing benchmarks, e.g. of the underlying
blockchain platform.

Enactment on public blockchains. From our cost analysis (Section 3.2),
we see that current transaction fees render the public Ethereum mainnet pro-
hibitively expensive for the presented approaches in our primary studies. When
considering blockchain, less quantiﬁable requirements play an important role
also. Many of the guarantees a blockchain oﬀers are a result of decentralisation [7,
Chapter 3.2]. Certain high-risk use cases (e.g., the transportation of dangerous
goods, as in Meroni et al. [49]) may beneﬁt from decentralised and resilient public
blockchains. Beyond Ethereum, we see a lot of promise in exploring alternative
public blockchains. Next generation proof-of-stake blockchains like Algorand9 or
Avalanche10 promise a more sustainable operation and low cost. Studying enact-
ment approaches on diﬀerent public platforms would produce valuable insights.
However, identifying advantages and drawbacks, and comparing diﬀerent block-
chain setups could prove to be challenging. We envision a ﬁrst step in connecting
our presented taxonomy to a taxonomy of blockchain platforms.

Beyond exploring alternative public blockchains, a diﬀerent line of research
has opened around Layer-2 technologies.11 These technologies reduce the involve-
ment of the blockchain and perform most tasks oﬀ-chain; these oﬀ-chain tasks
remain veriﬁable on the blockchain. We expect monitoring approaches to beneﬁt
in the short term from this line of research, as storing process traces becomes
signiﬁcantly cheaper. Long-term, we believe that enforcement approaches can
make use of veriﬁable oﬀ-chain computations to signiﬁcantly reduce cost.

5 Conclusion and Outlook

We performed a SLR on blockchain-based business process enactment. We iden-
tiﬁed a ﬁnal set of 36 primary studies. Based on these primary studies, we de-
veloped a taxonomy capable of describing the guarantees and capabilities of
enactment approaches, and classiﬁed each study accordingly. We discussed our
results in relation to the challenges of interorganisational processes.

We ﬁnd that blockchain is a natural ﬁt to ensure traceability and enforce
correctness of process execution. However, in terms of research focusing on ﬂex-
ibility and scalability, the ﬁeld of blockchain-based enactment remains nascent.
For all challenges, we have pointed out a range of research opportunities. We
have not addressed privacy or security concerns as these are often a result of, or

strongly dependent on, the employed blockchain technology. However, our tax-
onomy remains open for extensions—e.g., towards security or privacy properties.
In the future, we envision the development of a decision model, based on our
taxonomy, to support stakeholders considering blockchain-based enactment.
