Abstract—In the coming 6G era, Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
has been evolving towards 6G-enabled IoV with super-high data
rate, seamless networking coverage, and ubiquitous intelligence
by Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Transfer Learning (TL) has
great potential to empower promising 6G-enabled IoV, such as
smart driving assistance, with its outstanding features including
enhancing quality and quantity of training data, speeding up
learning processes and reducing computing demands. Although
TL had been widely adopted in wireless applications (e.g.,
spectrum management and caching), its reliability and security
in 6G-enabled IoV were still not well investigated. For instance,
malicious vehicles in source domains may transfer and share un-
trustworthy models (i.e., knowledge) about connection availability
to target domains, thus adversely affecting the performance
of learning processes. Therefore, it is important to select and
also incentivize trustworthy vehicles to participate in TL. In
this article, we ﬁrst introduce the integration of TL and 6G-
enbaled IoV and provide TL applications for 6G-enabled IoV. We
then design a secure and reliable transfer learning framework
by using reputation to evaluate the reliability of pre-trained
models and utilizing the consortium blockchain to achieve secure
and efﬁcient decentralized reputation management. Moreover, a
deep learning-based auction scheme for the TL model market
is designed to motivate high-reputation vehicles to participate in
model sharing. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed framework is secure and reliable with well-design
incentives for TL in 6G-enabled IoV.

I. INTRODUCTION

The unprecedented evolution of wireless communication
technologies, e.g., from 4G to 5G and beyond, has paved the
way for enormous advanced vehicular network applications.
Particularly, 6G technologies can provide seamless and ubiq-
uitous communications for large-scale and ad-hoc vehicular
networks [1]. Therefore, there is a strong push for traditional
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to evolve into 6G-enabled IoV to
meet stringent performance requirements. In detail, 6G tech-
nologies are expected to provide future mobile applications
in 6G-enabled IoV with unprecedented beneﬁts [2], such as
super-high data rates (e.g., up to 1Tb/s), very broad frequency
bands (e.g., 73GHz-140GHz and 1THz-3THz), and less than
1-millisecond end-to-end latency.

In the near future, 6G-enabled IoV is expected to fa-
cilitate a safer, more efﬁcient, and intelligent
trafﬁc sys-
tem, which strictly requires heterogeneous communications,
latency-critical applications, and scalable vehicular networks.
To meet these requirements, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has
been regarded as a core component to empower 6G-enabled
IoV [1]. Machine Learning (ML), e.g., deep learning (DL)
and reinforcement learning can be implemented to design and
optimize IoV architectures and network orchestrations in a
cost-efﬁcient manner. In addition, through a huge amount of
data collected from entities in IoV (e.g., vehicles and infras-
tructures), AI-based solutions are able to synthesize, analyze,
and provide decisions for optimal operations, thereby meeting
stringent security, high-mobility, and efﬁciency requirements
of 6G-enabled IoV. For example, AI can assist drivers by
recognizing, searching, and sharing local and roadside in-
formation, e.g., trafﬁc signs and adaptive speed signs [3].
This smart driving assistance thus can signiﬁcantly improve
driving safety, reduce energy consumption, and enhance trafﬁc
management efﬁciency in 6G-enabled IoV.

Although being regarded as an integral component of 6G-
enabled IoV, ML has been facing challenges for practical
implementation in the IoV environment due to high mobil-
ity, dynamics, and heterogeneity of vehicular networks [4].
In particular, the deployment of ML in 6G-enabled IoV is
constrained by dynamic wireless environments, lack of labeled
data, long training process, and limited computation capac-
ity of vehicles. Fortunately, Transfer Learning (TL) [5] has
been recently introduced with many applications in wireless
networks, e.g., spectrum management and signal recognition.
TL can help to develop intelligent solutions to maximize
data utilization efﬁciency from the same or similar domains,
thereby remarkably enhancing AI-based solutions for IoV [4].
As a result, the convergence of TL and 6G-enabled IoV is
expected to signiﬁcantly speed up the learning process and
reduce computation costs, thus meeting the extremely high
requirements of 6G-enabled IoV.

However, due to the utilization of knowledge from differ-
ent sources, which might be untrusted, to improve learning
efﬁciency, the reliability and security of TL are the main
concerns for its deployment. Thus, in this article, we introduce
a novel framework that provides secure and reliable services
for deploying TL in future 6G-enabled IoV. Speciﬁcally, we
introduce the concept of reputation as a metric to evaluate
the reliability and trustworthiness of pre-trained models built
and owned by vehicles, and thus design a reputation-based
trainer selection scheme for FL. To achieve secure and efﬁcient
decentralized reputation management, consortium blockchain

is leveraged for reputation management. Finally, to motivate
high-reputation vehicles participating in TL model transfer-
ring, a deep learning-based auction (DLA) scheme is designed
to incentivize trustworthy vehicles.

The main contributions of this article are summarized as

follows:

• We ﬁrst introduce TL, 6G, and IoV together with their
integration, which envisions a blueprint for future in-
telligent transportation systems. To enable efﬁcient TL
deployment, we design a novel model trading market
for 6G-enabled IoV. The proposed model trading can
effectively improve the quality of ML in TL environments
by encouraging good source model owners to participate
and contribute to the model transferring.

• We employ reputation as a reliable metric to select trust-
worthy pre-trained models for reliable TL. We then de-
sign a distributed reputation calculation and management
scheme by utilizing blockchain technology to regulate the
reputation in a decentralized and secure manner. With the
proposed metric and scheme, TL can be performed in IoV
systems in a more secure and reliable way.

• To achieve dynamic and reliable model trading, we pro-
pose the DLA scheme jointly considering the reputation
of model sellers and bids of model buyers. This scheme
is effective to maximize revenue for sellers, i.e., source
model owners, while guaranteeing individual rationality
and incentive compatibility for buyers, i.e., target model
owners. Simulation results show that the proposed TL
framework can assure secure and reliable services as well
as satisfactory incentives for vehicles.

II. FUNDAMENTALS OF TRANSFER LEARNING

A. Overview

Transfer learning has recently been introduced as a highly
effective machine learning solution that can address many
existing problems of traditional ML methods [5]. TL can
effectively extract valuable knowledge from learning tasks
in source domains to improve the learning performance in
similar target domains. In Fig. 1, we provide an example of
using traditional ML and TL for 6G-enable IoV in Space-
Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) [R7], which aim

to provide ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing space, air, and
ground vehicles and infrastructures. In SAGIN, AI can be
adopted for optimal path planning of satellite networks to
improve the driving safety of ground vehicles. However, the
performance of traditional ML highly relies on the collected
data, which can be costly and unbalanced. In detail, data from
the safe domain, e.g., a road segment with rare accidents,
is rich while data from the risky domain, e.g., a junction
with frequent accidents, is scarce. This leads to unsatisfactory
performance of ML models in risky tasks, such as car crashes.
Fortunately, TL can address the data unbalance issue over
traditional ML techniques by leveraging valuable knowledge
from similar environments or applications. Therefore, TL can
overcome the lack of labeled data in risky tasks. Additionally,
the shared knowledge, along with knowledge collected and
extracted from previous experiences, can also be utilized to
reduce computation workloads required for model training as
well as to speed up slow learning processes of traditional ML
techniques. Furthermore, the knowledge from other sources
can be transferred in the form of weights, such as learning
rate and random seed. As a result, TL does not incur much
communication overhead, and data privacy is also protected.
With such outstanding beneﬁts, TL has been considered to be
an indispensable part of future wireless networks [4].

B. Basic Concepts

• Domain: A domain is deﬁned by a feature space and a
marginal probability distribution. The marginal probabil-
ity distribution is the probability distribution of different
types of signal in the dataset.

• Task: Given a domain, a task can be deﬁned by a label
space (e.g., a set of all driving decisions) and a predictive
function. By training with datasets of the source and the
target domains, the predictive function can predict labels
for given data samples.

Based on the domain and task, TL can be deﬁned as follow:
given a source domain with a corresponding source task and
a target domain with a corresponding target task, the goal
of TL is to learn the target predictive function by leveraging
the knowledge gained from the source domain and the source
task. In TL, either the source domain and the target domain

Take
autonomous driving as an example, this means that, either the
image features of the set of source driving experience and
the set of target driving experience are different (i.e., driving
under different scenarios), or the marginal distributions of the
two sets are diverse. Therefore, TL can be applied in various
applications in 6G-enabled IoV.

C. Classiﬁcation of Transfer Learning

Based on the similarity between domains and tasks as well
as the availability of labeled data, TL can be classiﬁed into:
• Inductive TL: The source and target domains are the same,
but the source and target tasks are different. For inductive
TL, the target data should be labeled. Depending on the
availability of labeled data at the source domain, inductive
TL can be further classiﬁed into self-taught learning and
multi-task learning. In self-taught learning, the source
data is not labeled, so they can only be leveraged to
reduce the feature space in the target domain. In contrast,
labeled source data is available in multi-task learning.
Thus, the source model’s weights and parameters can be
transferred to the target model.

• Transductive TL: The source and target domains are
different, but the source and target tasks are the same.
For transductive TL, labeled target data is not required,
while the source data must be labeled.

• Unsupervised TL: The target and source tasks are dif-
ferent and there is no labeled data in both domains.
Commonly, the knowledge gained from the unsupervised
learning process at the source task can be transferred to
serve as the initial point for learning the target tasks.
The choice among these three TL classiﬁcations is deter-
mined by the availability of training data in learning problems.
When labeled data is available in target domains, inductive
TL can be utilized to accelerate the learning process of TL. If
labeled data is unavailable in target domains but available in
source domains, transductive TL is effective to be leveraged
to enhance quality and quantity of data in target domains.
Finally, when labeled data is unavailable in both source and
target domains, unsupervised TL can be used to transfer the
knowledge between source and target domains.

D. Strategies of Deep Transfer Learning

Imitating the brain structure of creatures, DL uses a multi-
layered architecture called Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
DNN is trained to perform speciﬁc tasks such as classiﬁcation,
clustering, or regression. With the training data, DNN updates
its knowledge, which is represented by its parameters. Using
the knowledge acquired during its learning phase, DNN exe-
cutes the learned task. A trained DL model can be regarded
as knowledge obtained from training data, including its archi-
tecture and parameters. Therefore, DL provides an effective
way to transfer knowledge from one domain to another one,
namely, Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) [5]. There are four
typical strategies used in DTL:

• Off-the-shelf pre-trained models: DL model training is
a data-hungry and time-consuming work. Fortunately,

3

such an inefﬁcient training process is relieved by directly
leveraging pre-trained models, which are trained from
neighboring domains, for target tasks. For example, in
trafﬁc sign classiﬁcation tasks, the pre-trained models,
such as VGG16 (storage size: 512 MB), GoogLeNet (40
MB), and ResNet50 (97 MB), can be easily obtained from
common DL libraries.

• Pre-trained models as feature extractors: Extracting fea-
tures is an important procedure in ML algorithms, which
directly affects decision-making for these algorithms. In
DL, DNN can automatically learn the features extraction
from the training data. Therefore, knowledge from the
source domain is embedded in this new representation,
which improves the learning process in the target domain.
• Fine-tuning pre-trained models: Instead of leveraging all
parameters of pre-trained models directly, certain parts
or a whole pre-trained source model can be continuously
ﬁne-tuned with target data to further improve the perfor-
mance of the TL model further. The ﬁne-tuned of pre-
trained models can be performed in Weight Initialized
and Selective Fine-tuning.

• Domain adaptation: Adapting a domain refers to trans-
ferring knowledge from one or more source domains and
improving the performance of the target learner. Domain
adaptation is often used in TL to reduce the differences
between domains.

However, the best strategy selection for DTL is not straight-
forward, which should consider multiple factors including the
size of target data and similarity between the source and
target domains. For example, when target labeled data is large,
Weight Initialization is an effective solution since overﬁtting
is not a considerable concern. In contrast, when target data is
small, we can use a pre-trained model as a feature extractor.
Moreover, if source and target data are similar, we can use
the whole pre-trained model. Otherwise, it is better to transfer
only some general features from the ﬁrst few layers of DNN.

E. Potential Applications of TL in 6G-enabled IoV

1) Mobile Extended Reality: Mobile Extended Reality
(XR) refers to various technologies, such as augmented,
mixed, and virtual reality employed to digitally enhance
vehicular environments and human interactions in real-time.
The rapid development of 6G networking technologies and
wearable devices is paving the way for XR. However, this also
brings forth several challenges. Particularly, drivers’ demands
for more high-quality and personalized experiences have been
rapidly increasing in 6G-enabled IoV. For example, a federated
learning algorithm in [6] was used to proactively determine
vehicles’ orientations and mobility to minimize breaks in
presence that can detach the XR users from their virtual world.
However, conventional ML techniques might not be effective
as they may require a lot of data and training time. By utilizing
TL, data collected from vehicles’ individual interactions can be
collected to train a generalized ML model, and then the model
is transferred to other nodes (e.g., vehicles) for ﬁne-tuning,
thereby enhancing the quality of experiences and reducing
computing demands simultaneously.

2) Mobile Digital Twins: Digital twins utilize the digital
monitoring of physical vehicles to achieve real-time and
accurate operations for 6G-enabled IoV. With the availability
of a massive amount of data, ML is an essential solution for
digital twins to leverage such data to enable various cutting-
edge vehicular applications. For instance, a federated learning-
empowered digital twin wireless network was introduced in [7]
to mitigate the unreliability in long-distance communication
between vehicles and infrastructures. However, due to strict
requirements of driver-privacy protection and data sharing,
the ML-based driving virtual assistants usually do not have
sufﬁcient data for timely trafﬁc analysis and monitoring. To
solve this problem, TL can be used to leverage knowledge
from similar experiences (i.e., source domain) to each vehicle
(i.e., target domain) aiming to improve the ML-based personal
driving assistant’s performance for driving safety.

i.e.,

3) UAV-assisted Autonomous Driving: Despite its rapid
development, autonomous driving is still facing challenges
in 6G-enabled IoV. Particularly, Unmanned aerial vehi-
cles (UAV)-assisted automated driving systems are network-
dependent,
they require continuous communication to
function properly. In this context, ML can enhance these
systems with ultra-high reliability and connectivity [1]. TL
can be applied into these systems which are impeded by
to enhance the performance of the
lack of labeled data,
conventional ML techniques. Speciﬁcally,
there are many
factors affecting vision-based data, e.g., weather conditions
and broken infrastructures. These variances are not always
presented in a dataset collected for a speciﬁc area. Therefore,
knowledge about these variances can be transferred from a
more comprehensive dataset of different areas to improve the
target models’ robustness if such events occur. For example, to
optimize the performance of the autonomous driving systems
under environments with different objectives, uncertainties,
and dynamics, a TL-based framework was developed in [8]
for enhancing scalability and reliability for joint radar and data
communication systems. Thus, TL allows vehicles to learn an
optimal policy quickly when they travel to new environments.

applications is provided in Table I.

III. CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTING TRANSFER
LEARNING IN 6G-ENABLED IOV

A. Technical Challenges of TL Algorithms

1) Determine the Source Task: TL requires in-depth and
task-speciﬁc analysis in domains of source and target tasks
to determine whether these tasks are similar. For example, to
perform similar resource management tasks in IoV, the source
task can be chosen based on physical distance from source to

target vehicles [5]. The reason is that surrounding vehicular
networks of source and target tasks are similar, and hence
their experiences are likely to be related. Alternatively, TL can
transfer knowledge of the same vehicular task (e.g., pedestrian
detection task) to different driving environments. However,
6G-enabled IoV typically has very wide coverage [1], leading
to a large number of choices for source domains for TL
applications. Moreover, several 6G-enabled IoV services, e.g.,
satellite communications, are speciﬁc to certain areas and
groups of vehicles. If source and target domains are not
correlated, the use of TL in 6G-enabled IoV even makes target
models perform worse than just training with only target data.
2) Determine What to Transfer: Following the choice of
the source task, the domain knowledge needs to be transferred
to target tasks. Determining what to transfer is important for
TL to enable vehicular networks to cover a wide range of
scenarios. However, in some scenarios, e.g., car crashes which
are rare, obtaining the labeled data for TL training in the real
world is intractable and even impossible. As such, transductive
TL is typically used to transfer some related knowledge to
handle the tasks in such scenarios. For instance, in emergency
rescue tasks, the rescue vehicles can be trained to save life in
simulation systems and then be dispatched in real-world [1].
To further reduce ﬁne-tuning time, some TL approaches to
transfer the entire source model, while others transfer only
the ﬁrst few layers of DNN. However, this question depends
on IoV scenarios that affect the ﬁne-tuning time of TL.

B. Reliability and Security of TL

1) Decentralized Environments: Most of the aforemen-
tioned TL model sharing schemes are centralized, i.e., the
transfer of knowledge is governed by a single entity, e.g.,
a network operator. However,
in 6G-enabled IoV with a
massive scale of interconnected vehicles and infrastrutures [1],
decentralized TL model sharing is a more promising approach.
Particularly, valuable knowledge can be obtained from ex-
ternal or third-party sources such as neighboring networks,
controlled by different operators, or vehicles. However, for
such decentralized approaches, security and privacy challenges
become a primary concern, e.g., attackers, eavesdroppers, and
malicious vehicles. For example, a model used for accident
prevention in 6G-enabled IoV should have a higher degree of
accuracy than that of an ordinary vehicular networks because
a single false negative event (e.g., failed to predict a potential
accident) could have very serious consequences. In recent
years, blockchain, which can enhance decentralized network’s
security and privacy, has been successfully applied in various
wireless applications. Thus, utilizing blockchain for decentral-
ized TL is a attractive research direction. For instance, the

authors in [9] proposed a blockchain-based framework for
DTL. By using blockchain and smart contracts, the proposed
framework allows vehicles to securely and reliably share
their models, data, and resources. Moreover, smart contracts
facilitate automatic payment processes, which paves the way
for crowdsourcing-enabled TL.

2) Model Quality Evaluation: TL is still vulnerable to
adversarial attacks for data owners (e.g., vehicles) in 6G-
enabled IoV can intentionally or unintentionally mislead the
source model during TL processes. For instance, in the poi-
soning attack, an attacker sends a malicious source model to
manipulate the parameters of the source model, resulting in the
failure of the model transfer [5]. Furthermore, dynamic vehic-
ular networking environments may lead to some unintentional
adverse behaviors of source model owners. In addition, data
owners may unintentionally update poor-quality models due to
high-speed mobility or energy constraints, thereby degrading
the learning performance. Thus, TL should be able to evaluate
the quality of transferred models accurately to avoid such
intentionally or unintentionally unreliable model sharing.

3) Efﬁcient Incentive Mechanism for Model Sharing: TL
can improve the effectiveness of current ML algorithms by
transferring the knowledge of the source domain to the tar-
get domain. However, to motivate high-quality source model
trainers to share their models, an efﬁcient incentive mechanism
for a model sharing market is also needed. In this market,
source model trainers (e.g., vehicles) as sellers spend their
data and computing resources to improve the inference ability
of pre-trained models in source domains. On the other hand,
model buyers in the market are the receivers, whose goals are
obtaining the utility-maximized and reliable target models to
perform their local tasks (e.g., trafﬁc sign recognition tasks).
Naturally, participants in the TL market are self-interested
and attempt to maximize their utilities. Model sellers intend
to maximize their revenue from model trading, while model
buyers aim to receive the best models for local tasks. Without
proper pricing and allocation mechanisms, trustworthy model
sellers may be reluctant to share their models with potential
buyers. Moreover, in 6G-enabled IoV which requires ultra-
incentive
high reliable and ultra-low latency services [1],
schemes are required to perform decisions in real-time under
dynamic network environments. As a result,
the incentive
scheme designed for the TL market to meet these stringing
requirements has still not well investigated.

IV. A SECURE AND RELIABLE FRAMEWORK OF
TRANSFER LEARNING FOR 6G-ENABLED IOV

In this section, we propose a secure and reliable TL
framework for 6G-enabled IoV to address the aforementioned
problems. In particular, this framework includes three phases,
i.e., blockchain-empowered decentralized model sharing, repu-
tation for model quality evaluation, and learning-based auction
for model trading. Thus, the proposed TL framework for 6G-
enabled IoV can offer decentralized and real-time services.

A. Blockchain Empowered TL Model Trading Markets

We consider pre-trained model sharing as model trading
between source and target domains in a TL model trading

5

market. To achieve secure pre-trained model trading, a con-
sortium blockchain named “TL blockchain” is established on
edge servers (e.g., RoadSide Units, RSU) acting as miners to
run smart contracts for model information sharing and model
trading of the pre-trained models [10]. Speciﬁcally,

• Model Information Sharing Smart Contract: Each model
owner (e.g., a vehicle) ﬁrst ﬁnalizes a training task (e.g.,
trafﬁc sign recognition) in the source domain. The model
owners generate metadata of their pre-trained models
including pseudonyms of owners, model descriptions
of the pre-trained models (e.g., training task, accuracy,
model size, model usage, trading requirement, timestamp,
and digital signature for information veriﬁcation), and
biding prices. The model owners then run the model
information sharing smart contract to automatically up-
load the metadata to the TL blockchain miners, thus
running a consensus algorithm, e.g., delegated proof-of-
stake, to ﬁnish block veriﬁcation and synchronization.
After that, the pre-trained models can be recorded on the
TL blockchain for model trading (as illustrated in Steps
1 and 2 in Fig. 2).

• Model Trading Smart Contract: Model buyers (e.g., vehi-
cles) in the target domain obtain the latest block data from
the TL blockchain. According to buyers’ training tasks,
e.g., pedestrian recognition, buyers search the metadata
(e.g., past transaction and reputation records) on the block
data and pick out potential model sellers (i.e., model
owners in the source domain). Buyers also retrieve the
reputation values of model sellers from the TL blockchain
to ﬁlter malicious sellers with low reputations. Here, we
utilize reputation value as a metric to indicate the reliabil-
ity of model owners, and the reputation reﬂects the quality
of pre-trained models of model owners (more details
about reputation are given in Section IV-B). Model buy-
ers and sellers perform a learning-based auction scheme
for model pricing and trading according to bidding prices
and the reputation of the sellers (Section IV-C). Then,
model buyers obtain pre-trained models (i.e., knowledge)
from the matched sellers and begin to ﬁne-tune their
target models. If the training performance of a target task
is good, e.g., accuracy higher than a given threshold, the
buyer will treat this trading record as a positive event
and generate a good reputation rating (Steps 3, 4 and
trading smart
5 in Fig. 2) [11]. After that, a model
contract will be executed to upload the reputation and
trading records to miners in the TL blockchain for block
veriﬁcation and recording (Step 6 in Fig. 2).

B. Decentralized Reputation Management

Similar to [11], reputation is introduced to measure the
trustworthiness and reliability of model sellers according to
their historical behaviors. By the reputation, model buyers
can select reliable and trusted model buyers with high-quality
pre-trained models, thus avoiding the effects of low-quality
models on target task training. Moreover, since reputation
plays a signiﬁcant role for TL, to remove the potential risks of
centralized reputation calculation and management, we design

decentralized model sharing, reputation for model quality evaluation, and learning-based auction for model trading.

a decentralized reputation calculation and management scheme
utilizing advantages of TL and blockchain technologies.

C. Deep Learning-based Auction Scheme for TL Model Trad-
ing Markets

• Decentralized reputation calculation: For each traded
pre-trained model from a seller, it will generate a per-
formance rating of the pre-trained model using in the
target tasks by model quality evaluation methods, e.g.,
sharply values [12]. If the pre-trained model leads to good
performance on the target tasks, e.g., high accuracy, the
model buyer treats this trading interaction with the model
seller as a positive event, otherwise, the interaction is a
negative event. Then, the direct reputation of buyer i for
seller j is denoted as the ratio of the number of positive
interaction events to the total number of interaction events
in a time window. To achieve accurate and objective
reputation calculation, we should consider both direct rep-
utation and an overall recommended reputation from its
friends, who have cooperated with the buyer before, for
the same seller. Here, the overall recommended reputation
is expressed by the weighted sum of the trustworthiness
weights of buyers for their friends and the corresponding
recommended reputation of the friend to the same seller.
Both the trustworthiness weight and reputation value are
in the range of [0, 1]. Moreover, the referenced reputation
values from strangers are the average reputation value of
a stranger to the seller. Finally, the integrated reputation
value rij of buyer i to seller j is the weighted sum of the
direct reputation, the recommended reputation, and the
referenced reputation values.

• Blockchain-based reputation management: To achieve
secure and decentralized reputation management, after
model training, the model buyers upload their integrated
reputation values with the corresponding digital signa-
tures as “transactions” to the miners of the TL blockchain.
With the help of an efﬁcient consensus algorithm, the
veriﬁed reputation data is stored in the TL blockchain for
immutable, transparent, and reliable management. These
reputation values will be recommended to and referenced
by other model buyers.

To develop an efﬁcient incentive mechanism, Auction The-
ory is regarded as a promising tool to maximize the income of
model sellers while ensuring bidders’ desired characteristics,
such as individual rationality and incentive compatibility [13].
However, traditional auction schemes cannot be applied to
real-time optimal trading and pricing scenarios. We, therefore,
develop a Deep Learning-based auction (DLA) scheme to
make the allocating and pricing decisions for model sharing
when demands of vehicles frequently change over time. Par-
ticularly, an auctioneer parameterized by neural networks ﬁrst
performs monotone transformations of input buyers’ values,
as well as the reputation of sellers. Based on the real-
time reputations of sellers, the auctioneer then calculates the
allocation rules, i.e., winning probabilities of bidders, and
conditional payment rules for the TL model market. Lastly,
the auctioneer is trained w.r.t. the loss function so that it can
adjust the weights to optimize the expected outcome of this
market. After the auctioneer is well-trained, it will be encoded
in smart contracts and uploaded to the TL Blockchain, which
is composed by RSUs in the 6G-enabled IoV.

In DLA, the auctioneer knows the value distribution of
bidders but not their actual valuation. The auctioneer inputs
sellers’ reputations and bidders’ bids, and then outputs the
pricing rules and the allocation rules (Steps 4.1 and 4.2 in Fig.
2). The buyer with its valuation obtains its utility computed
as valuation minus price. An auction is dominant strategy
incentive compatible (DSIC) [14], if each buyer maximizes
its utility by reporting truthfully regardless of its counterparts
report. When each buyer receives a non-zero utility at the
end of the auction, it is (ex-post) individually rational. The
DSIC auction requires each buyer to report truthfully, and so
the revenue on the valuation proﬁle should be accurate. The
DSIC auction that maximizes its revenue is considered to be
the optimal DSIC auction design.

To obtain a satisfactory solution for DSIC auction, DLA
schemes are widely adopted. DLA utilizes multi-layer neural

sequentially inputted bids for multiple items in the TL model
markets, neural networks are used to process the current
state and output the temporal results. In detail, reputations
downloaded from the TL blockchain are input in the hidden
layer. Thus, the proposed auction scheme is more reliable.
Then, the temporal results are input to the softmax layer for
allocation rules and the sigmoid layer for pricing rules. The
goal of the DLA scheme is to ﬁnd a solution to minimize
the negative, expected revenue (Step 4.3 in Fig. 2), while
is to
satisfying incentive compatibility. Our primary goal
ensure that the selected auction satisﬁes the requirement for
incentive compatibility in the learning problem. Our method
for measuring incentive compatibility is to calculate an ex-post
regret for every bidder. Bidder is likely to regret their decision
ex-post (Step 4.4 in Fig. 2). In this context, the learning prob-
lem is to minimize the expected loss, i.e., the expected negated
revenue s.t. sum ex-post regret for all bidders equals zero (Step
4.5 in Fig. 2). Using the augmented Lagrangian method, we
solve the constrained training problem over the space of neural
autoworker parameters. Adding a quadratic penalty term for
violating constraints, the Lagrangian function is deﬁned for the
optimization problem. Therefore, the DLA scheme can make
secure and reliable optimal allocation and pricing decisions for
the TL model market in real-time, hence preventing malicious
vehicles from adversely affecting the performance of TL in
6G-enabled IoV. Furthermore, the computation complexity of
the DLA scheme depends on the number of hidden layers
and number of hidden neurons in hidden layers rather than
the dimensions of the input layer and the output layer, i.e.,
size of markets. The complexity analysis of the DLA scheme
with H hidden neurons is O((N+M)D+D2) for N buyers and
M sellers. Thus, the proposed scheme can be applied to large-
scale TL model trading markets. In addition to addressing the
TL model trading market, this secure and reliable framework is
not limited by model trading scenarios. The framework is also
capable of addressing other service trading problems requiring
secure and reliable solutions.

D. Simulation Results

Simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of our
DL-based auction scheme. The proposed auction scheme is
implemented with the same parameters in [14]. TL model
markets are simulated with different numbers of participants to
analyze the performance of the DLA scheme. Here, TL model
markets consist of 3 buyers and 3 sellers (3×3) and 3 buyers
and 5 sellers (3×5). Figure 3 shows the simulation results for
evaluation of the proposed secure and reliable TL framework.
As shown in Fig. 3(a), the DLA and the DLA with low repu-
tation sellers (DLA-LR) schemes all converge quickly to the
solution. Compared with the second-price auction (SPA) [13],
the DLA scheme can improve the revenue by about 30%, while
the DLA-LR can improve by about 10%. Moreover, Fig. 3(b)
shows the change of TL model accuracy affected by malicious
sellers’ attack strength and the permitted reputation of the TL
market. We can observe that the increasing attack strength
decreases the accuracy of target models. The higher reputation

threshold of being sellers brings larger accuracy because fewer
malicious models from low-reputation sellers are transferred
to the buyers in the target domain. Fig. 3(b) also illustrates
that the reputation scheme can ensure reliable and secure TL
by removing unreliable or malicious source model trainers.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN ISSUES

In this article, we propose a secure and reliable transfer
learning framework for 6G-enabled IoV with blockchain em-
powered model trading market. In the model trading market,
we ﬁrst introduce reputation as the metric to evaluate the
reliability of model sellers in the source domain. With the
help of reputation, we then design the machine learning-based
auction scheme considering sellers’ reputations to achieve
optimal DSIC auction in model trading pricing for reliable
model trading in TL. The simulation results show that the
proposed framework and scheme can provide secure and
reliable transfer learning services with well-design incentives.
There are several possible directions that are worth being
studied: 1) Since vehicles in 6G networks have limited power
and resources. It still remains to be an open issue on how to
design light-weight and resource-efﬁcient TL algorithms for
large-scale deployment on these vehicles by combining ad-
vanced machine learning techniques, such as sparse represen-
tation in neural networks, and pruning algorithms to dwindle
TL models. 2) Since model quality valuation methods directly
affect the reputation calculation, there is one more open issue
on how to design more accurate and efﬁcient model quality
valuation methods for 6G-enable IoV to improve the accuracy
and objectivity of reputation calculation, thus enhancing the
detection performance of unreliable model sellers. 3) It is
also an open issue on how to improve the scalability of
consortium blockchain for efﬁcient reputation management in
TL-based 6G-enabled IoV. Sharding and cross-chain technolo-
gies are promising solutions to establish scalable and efﬁcient
blockchain systems for 6G-enabled IoV. 4) Considering the
high overhead of a large number of vehicles that may join in
the transfer learning for 6G-enabled IoV, efﬁcient schemes for
optimizing the number of training model in target domains are
worth investigating to balance the learning performance and
resource cost.
