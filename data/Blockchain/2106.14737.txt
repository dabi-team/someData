Abstract—Can we make undergraduate engineering education
easier and more fun? This research aims to see if we can answer
the ambitious question! The digital game-based learning (DGBL)
has been found to increase the efﬁcacy of learning when applied
in engineering classes thanks to its ability to make students feel
easy and fun. However, the state-of-the-art DGBL schemes still
observe challenges in various aspects including cost, efﬁcacy,
readiness of instructors and students, etc. Motivated from the
challenges, this research proposes to design a DGBL platform
that features visualized and systematic views. Speciﬁcally, we
identify the blockchain applied to wireless communications and
networking systems as a key ecosystem that we capitalize the
beneﬁt of the proposed platform.. As such, in this paper, we
lay out a comprehensive DGBL pedagogy that
includes (i)
creation of relevant assignment activities and class materials in
a relevant course and (ii) evaluation of the pedagogical efﬁcacy.
In a long-term view, a successful delivery of this research will
increase the conﬁdence of undergraduate engineering students
on the “in-concert” dynamics of various factors determining the
performance of a blockchain system built on a wireless network.

I. INTRODUCTION

This paper certiﬁes request of presentation at the ‘Innovative

in Practice’ track of the ‘Work in Progress (WIP)’ session.

A. Motivation

There is a jumble of symbols, concepts, systems, and
protocols that make engineering and science sound very vague
and incomprehensive. The question we raise is: Can we
provide effective access and understanding of these concepts
and introduce them into an undergraduate curriculum?

Digital game is one of the most efﬁcient tools to motivate
youngsters: they feel easy, keen, conﬁdent, and fun in dealing
with games, which makes them enjoy thriving to go through
challenges. Taking advantage of this, the digital game-based
learning (DGBL) is known to make learning more attractive,
motivating, and personalized from the learner’s viewpoint
typical forms of
[1][2]. Some difﬁculties in carrying out
inquiry-based learning in a class have been pointed out [3]-[6]:
to summarize, (i) the complexity in the contexts and (ii) the

students’ low engagement level. However, when delivered in
the form of a digital game-based activity, greater chances of
being more joyful and efﬁcient have been found: speciﬁcally,
(i) self-discovery and construction of one’s own reality [7]-
[11]; (ii) increase in students’ inquiry experience [12][13]; (iii)
engagement of students in applying knowledge to real-world
contexts [14]-[19]; and (iv) collaborative learning where two
or more learners interact and engage to learn together [20]-
[22].

In further studies,

it has been found that

the level of
students’ engagement inﬂuences their inquiry learning effec-
tiveness [3][23]-[25]. It motivates the need for precise evalu-
ation of students’ feedback on management of the proposed
gamiﬁed learning platform (as shall be described in Section
VI).

We identify blockchain applied in wireless communications
as the new content to explore the effectiveness of DGBL in
an undergraduate curriculum. The key rationale is that this
rapidly evolving ﬁeld of technology offers great opportunities
for students to experience multidisciplinary topics involving
elements of mathematics, (i.e., abstract algebra and number
theory), cryptography, computer networks, etc. The necessity
for systematic comprehension of such an interplay among
various, dissimilar areas makes a compelling case in favor
of infusing new learning materials and strategies to enhance
an undergraduate education program. In fact,
the wireless
technology is experiencing a variety of completely new prob-
lem domains including spectrum sharing [26] and vehicle-to-
everything (V2X) networking [27][28]. Nonetheless, at the
blockchain consensus 2017, scholars have concluded that
academics are not keeping pace with blockchain change [29].
Given the signiﬁcance of blockchain expertise in new under-
graduates, strong educational support is vital and current edu-
cational curricula should reﬂect cutting-edge trends and needs
in this sector. Speciﬁcally, students are challenged more than
ever to be creative to confront contemporary issues related to
blockchain. Hence, educational environments should cultivate
students that are equipped with a set of tools to formulate,
solve, and properly tackle multidisciplinary problems.

While playing on the proposed gamiﬁed platform, students
are expected to learn on such multifaceted interplay that
is enabled by visualization of cause and effect of different

 
 
 
 
 
 
approaches and decisions that they make. For instance, the
connectivity is a critical factor determining the performance
to
of a network, which is not a straightforward concept
grasp when not visualized. In the proposed platform, through
visualization, students will be able to (i) perceive which areas
are better or less connected, (ii) route their own nodes toward
the directions that they remain in a maximum connectivity, and
(iii) in turn, maximize the data exchange performance through
a round of the game. Such pedagogical improvement led by
this research will provide a model for similar approaches
technology, engineering, and
in other challenging science,
mathematics (STEM) education domains.

II. STATE-OF-THE-ART AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND
THEIR LIMITATIONS

A. Current Undergraduate Programs and Limitations

Several institutions have deployed DGBL in their under-
graduate curricula. We discuss their contributions and limita-
tions as follows.

Virginia Tech [30] has developed an online learning plat-
form providing visualization and gamiﬁcation and published
advantages on education of wireless communications engineer-
ing [31]. Yet, the need for connecting 48 physical hardware
nodes, the system requires signiﬁcant amounts of time and cost
to maintain or host demonstrations or competitions. Moreover,
it also left pedagogical challenges including: inabilities to
visualize and analyze (i) mobility of nodes in a network and
(ii) systematic perspectives as a result of interplay among
multiple mobile nodes and parameters determining a network
characteristic.

The Game Studio at American University [32] offers aca-
demic programs (including baccalaureate and graduate) across
interdisciplinary ﬁelds including human-computer interaction,
civic engagement, journalism, art, education, and health. How-
ever, the published games’ contents are not suitable for imme-
diate adaptation to STEM education. Moreover, access to the
actual games are not available for general users, which limits
the applicability.

The City University of New York (CUNY) Games Network
[33] connects educators to games and other forms of interac-
tive and inquiry-based learning. However, the games available
on the network do not provide capabilities to understand sys-
tematic interplay among multiple variables and factors, which
is easily encountered in a STEM-related problem solving.

The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University [34] investi-
gated efﬁcacy of games in understanding human behavior–
i.e., personality, motivation, performance, teamwork, etc. But,
being dedicated to psychological disciplines only, their ped-
agogical ﬁndings have little implication to improvement of a
STEM curriculum.

In Fall 2013, via the A-Games Project [35], the University
of Michigan surveyed 488 K-12 teachers nationwide about
the efﬁcacy of DGBL. From uses of games to cover content
mandated by state/national or local/district standards, the ma-
jority of teachers were found to believe games were effective
for motivating students, helping students reinforce or master
previously taught content, providing useful information about
student learning, and teaching students new content.

B. Common Challenges

Some scholarly work has also studied general challenges
found from other DGBL programs: (i) cost of games [35];
(ii) limited time to deploy the games and analyze the efﬁcacy
[35]; (iii) lack of technology literacy by teachers and students
[35]; (iv) lack of place to ﬁnd appropriate games [35]; (v)
performance evaluation methods still relying on standardized
test scores [35]; (vi) necessity of additional resources (i.e.,
pedagogical and technical supports) [36]; (vii) issues of ac-
cess and the digital divide [36]; (viii) necessity of periodic
examination on whether students actually prefer this approach
to teaching [36]; and (iv) fear of distraction due to perception
of a game as leisure rather than academic drive [37][38].

III. PROBLEM STATEMENTS AND RESPECTIVE ACTION
PLANS

The goal of this research is to modify current undergrad-
uate electrical and computer engineering (ECE) education
pedagogy to employ an innovative gamiﬁed tool, which will
make concepts related to blockchain more accessible to un-
dergraduates. While the DGBL has been found to be effective
in education of many engineering aspects, this research is
particularly focused on enhancing the efﬁcacy of learning
dynamic behaviors of complex wireless networks (e.g., V2X
networks). The key rationale is the need for systematic under-
standing of orchestration of various topics forming the basis
of such a complex wireless network: e.g., probability and
statistics, optimization, communications theory, networking
theory, graph theory, cryptography, etc.

As a result of careful

the currently
available DGBL-related literature and resources, this research
speciﬁes three problem statements:

investigation about

● P1: No DGBL focuses on training a systematic view on

complex behaviors of a network

● P2: No explicit ﬁnding exists on the efﬁcacy of DGBL

focusing on such systematic understanding

● P3: It is critical to monitor students’ perception on a new

learning tool

In response to the problem statements, we design this research
in such way to undertake three action plans :

● A1: Development of a gamiﬁed learning platform
● A2:

Incorporation into a number of undergraduate

courses

● A3: Evaluation of the efﬁcacy of the proposed approach

As such, this research aims to transform a difﬁcult-to-grasp
ﬁeld into an easily accessible learning environment, which will
contribute to a breakthrough in ECE education.

IV. CURRENT STATUS

We report that the current status of this project is approx-
imately 50% toward the completion of A1. Technical details
follow in this section.

Fig. 1. Example of a character view

Fig. 3. Screenshot of platform development

Fig. 2. Screenshot of an example map with nodes distributed

1) Player Character: As illustrated in Fig. 1, each user
is able to choose a character. Each character is assigned a
certain role between a “full” node and a “half” node. A full
node has full capabilities including block generation, mining
(i.e., validation), and connection to networks. A half node,
on the other hand, has all the capabilities but is not able
to mine a block. Also, other capabilities (i.e., block mining
speed, mobility speed, indoor-outdoor penetration, jump, etc)
are differentiated among the characters.

While playing a game, a user sees a map to move its charac-
ter, as shown in Fig. 2. The user is able to switch the display
into the “character view” as shown in Fig. 1, to check the
current status of (i) energy consumption and (ii) connectivity.
Note that energy consumption is monitored because it is one
of the key parameters measuring the efﬁciency of an entire
blockchain system [39], which will be explained in more depth
in the Scenarios part of this section.

2) Map: The game will be designed as a role-playing
game (RPG) [40], to focus on visualizing the interplay among

Fig. 4. Example of block management process

parameters of network connectivity. As shown in Fig. 3, we
have already (i) started developing a game environment and
thus (ii) is familiar with related tools to enhance the quality. A
user is able to switch to the blockchain status as shown in Fig.
4, which displays all the activities of (i) block generation, (ii)
attempt of validation, (iii) result of validation, and (iv) addition
to the chain.

3) Connectivity: For modeling signals’ propagation, we
adopt
the standard models deﬁned by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) [41], which determine the size of
a cell and types of obstacle (e.g., cars, buildings, etc). While
the geographical type can be selected by a user, as mentioned
earlier in the Platform part, other geographical settings will
be randomized in every round of the game–e.g., locations of
roads, base stations, obstacles, etc. Also, the network type will

be differentiated depending on the game character that a user
has selected. For instance, character Alice can be connected
to Wi-Fi, 3G, and 5G, while character Bob can be connected
to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Lastly, network coverage will also
be varied. Not all the area is being covered by the network
coverages: some areas will be left to be uncovered, in which
no block can be exchanged [42][43]. Each user can make a
strategy to route to maximize the coverage, which will in turn
maximize the performance of a blockchain system.

4) Scenarios: Each student’s character control the character
on the roads in the map as shown in Fig. 2. A block is
generated every N seconds at a random user (no matter a full
or a half node), and has to be “validated” to go through a PoW
and be added to the chain [44]. A block can only be validated
by a full node [45], and thus must be handed to another
full node for validation [46]. The time until a rendezvous
with a full node varies according to various parameters–e.g.,
connectivity, a character’s moving speed, location on the road,
number of obstacles, etc. The rationale is that it usually takes
a tradeoff between the blockchain’s pursuit of the distributed
decision making and the wireless’ complexity in dealing with
the distributed networking architecture [47].

V. PILOT PLAN

The outcome of this project will be incorporated into
interactive assignments and class materials and piloted in a
course that the author is currently teaching, in such a way
to accomplish A2. We will develop two types of activities
based on the proposed gamiﬁed learning platform–namely, in-
teractive lab session and hands-on assignment. The following
materials will be developed and used commonly in both types
of the assignment: lecture, student report format, quiz, survey,
and activity instruction manual.

The next step is to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the proposed
pedagogy, which will accomplish A3. The impact of using the
proposed interactive tool on student learning will be assessed
based on the criteria of student learning outcomes (SLOs)
for engineering by the Accreditation Board for Engineering
and Technology (ABET) [48]. The Computing Accreditation
Commission (CAC) SLOs [49] will be used as a secondary
reference. Moreover, since the experiment will collect data
from human participants, all experimental protocols will be
reviewed and approved by both institutions’ Institutional Re-
view Boards (IRBs). The IRBs will conﬁrm that the protocols
are compliant with all state and federal regulations involving
human subjects testing, ensuring proper care throughout the
recruitment of subjects and collection of data.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

This research aims to (i) build a DGBL platform, (ii)
incorporate into an ECE course, and (iii) evaluate the ped-
agogical efﬁcacy. The project had been motivated from three
problem statements, which corresponded to three action plans.
As reported in this paper, we have made the progress through
A1, while A2 and A3 are left clearly planned. To elaborate
our progress in A1, we have built a DGBL framework that is
similar to a RPG where multiple players can explore different

4

maps with different levels of wireless connectivity. By doing
so, students are expected to learn how the connectivity affects
the performance of a wireless network and a blockchain
system overlaid on the network. In conclusion, the success
of this research will cultivate students that are equipped with
skillsets to deal with a wide variety of problems raised in
the rapidly evolving ecosystems of blockchain and wireless
communications.
