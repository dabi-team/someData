A Collective Anomaly Detection Method Over Bitcoin Network 

Abstract 

The  popularity  and  amazing  attractiveness  of  cryptocurrencies,  and  especially  Bitcoin,  absorb 
countless enthusiasts daily. Although Blockchain technology prevents fraudulent behavior, it cannot 
detect fraud on its own. There are always unimaginable ways to commit fraud, and the need to use 
anomaly detection methods to identify abnormal and fraudulent behaviors has become a necessity. 
The main purpose of this study is to present a new method for detecting anomalies in Bitcoin with 
more appropriate efficiency. For this purpose, in this study, the diagnosis of the collective anomaly 
was used, and instead of diagnosing the anomaly of individual addresses and wallets, the anomaly 
of users was examined, and the anomaly was more visible among users who had multiple wallets. In 
addition  to  using  the  collective  anomaly  detection  method  in  this  study,  the  Trimmed_Kmeans 
algorithm was used for clustering and the proposed method succeeded in identifying 14 users who 
had  committed  theft,  fraud,  and  hack  with  26  addresses  in  9  cases.  Compared  to  previous  works, 
which detected a maximum of 7 addresses in 5 cases of fraud, the proposed method has performed 
well.  Therefore,  the  proposed  method,  by  presenting  a  new  approach,  in  addition  to  reducing  the 
processing  power  to  extract  features,  succeeded  in  detecting  abnormal  users  and  also  was  able  to 
find more transactions and addresses committed a scam.

Introduction 

1- 
Blockchain was first proposed in 1991 to establish an encryption and information exchange system 
to  address  data  security  concerns  [1].  Bitcoin  as  the  first  electronic  cryptocurrency  was  emerged 
from  the  Blockchain  features  by  Satoshi  Nakamoto  in  2008  [2]  and  attracted  the  attention  of 
governments around the world to use Bitcoin. Attractiveness and the amazing popularity of Bitcoin 
as a cryptocurrency have made blockchain so popular. Blockchain has gained many enthusiasts in 
industry  and  academia  and  attracted  the  attention  of  many  applications  such  as  the  Internet  of 
Things [3]. Due to this popularity, many cybercriminals and even real-world criminals (because of 
the anonymity of users) became interested in using Blockchain and Bitcoin [4]. 

However,  blockchain  is  not  without  drawbacks  and  limitations  and  is  not  completely  immune  to 
fraud, hack, attacks, and other malicious activities. Bitcoin users are always at risk of being hacked, 
and  in  addition  to  the  enormous  economic  losses  it  causes  to  these  users,  it  can  also  cause  credit 
crises  for  commercial  websites  [5-8].  Due  to  this  technology's  novelty,  the  developed  security 
mechanisms for some systems do not yet exist, and there have been several hack attacks on digital 
currencies [5]. Although Blockchain technology prevents fraudulent behavior, it cannot detect fraud 
on its own, so new innovative techniques and methods are needed to track attacks [9]. The amazing 
attractiveness  of  Bitcoin,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  rise  of  cybercrime  activity,  on  the  other,  have 
made it imperative to use anomaly detection for identifying potential scams. 

 
This study intends to use collective anomaly detection (instead of point anomaly detection) on all 
one user's wallets (instead of individual wallets) to remove features that have higher computational 
and operational capabilities. We believe this approach reduces data size and helps to better identify 
abnormalities that have been intentionally used with multiple user wallets. 

Previous Works 

2- 
Initially, blockchain was thought to be resistant to all kinds of attacks due to its cryptographic type 
and thanks to consensus algorithms, but security issues have prompted researchers to look for ways 
to detect anomalies in blockchain. Several studied tackled the anomaly detection issue in blockchain 
[4,8,10,6,11-18,7]. 

Table  1  shows  a  summary  of  the  types  of  malicious  attacks  on  Blockchains  and  the  tactics  and 
potential  strategies  that  can  be  used  to  confront  them.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  anomaly  detection 
methods  can  be  used  to  detect  the  most  malicious  attacks.  For  example,  using  anomaly  detection 
methods,  bitcoin  accounts  of  users  who  have  used  combinational  services  to  engage  in  illegal 
activities or money laundering can be detected and tracked.

According  to  Table  1,  one  of  the  diagnostic  anomalies  in  blockchain  is  countering  the  Record 
Hacking attack and detecting theft, hacking, fraud, which has been considered by this study and the 
following works: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Zambre  et  al.  [8]  used  six  features  and  the  K-Means  algorithm  to  identify  suspicious  and  rogue 
users  and  found  a  starting  point  for  analyzing  suspicious  users.  Pham  et  al.  [10]  used  three  main 
social  networking  methods  (power  degree  &  densification  laws,  K-Means  clustering,  and  local 
outlier  factor)  to  diagnose  anomalies.  They  were  able  to  discover  one  of  the  30  known  cases  of 
theft. In a subsequent study, Pham et al. [6] used three unsupervised learning methods, including K-
Means clustering, Mahalanobis distance, and unsupervised vector machine (SVM), and were able to 
identify a total of 3 of the 30 known cases. 

Monamo et al. [4] emphasizing that anomaly detection plays an important role in data mining and 
considering that many remote locations have important information for further investigation, and in 
the  Bitcoin  network,  diagnostics  anomaly  means  detecting  fraud,  used  the  Trimmed-Kmeans 
method.  They  were  able  to  successfully  identify  5  of  the  addresses  involved  in  30  cases  of  theft, 
hack, fraud, or loss. 

Monamo  et  al.  used the kd-trees algorithm instead of the Trimmed-Kmeans algorithm in  the next 
study [11] and were able to discover 7 of the target addresses, which were involved in 5 out of 30 
cases of theft,  hack, fraud, or loss. (In many cases of theft,  hack, or  fraud, thieves participated in 
multiple addresses and wallets to make it difficult to detect anomalies, leaving multiple addresses 
and wallets in each theft.) 

In  a  study,  Signorini  et  al.  [12]  suggested  using  Fork  instead  of  eliminating  it  to  diagnose 
abnormalities. Chawathe  [13] further analyzes the method of Monamo  et  al.  [4] and recommends 
this method to detect anomalies in the blockchain. In addition to the method and algorithm used in 
the previous records, the subject of feature selection is also very important, which is compared in 
Table 2 . 

According to  the results obtained in  previous records, several  works have been conducted, and in 
most  of  these  methods,  improvements  in  anomaly  detection  have  been  achieved  by  changing  or 
adding new features or changing the algorithm, but in all  methods, only the anomaly detection of 
wallet addresses has been sought. And if the user has multiple wallets and the behavior of each of 
these addresses seems normal, the previous methods will be a bit inefficient. Since abnormal users 
mainly use multiple wallet addresses to normalize their behavior, it can be more efficient to choose 
a method that can examine the user's behavior instead of the wallet address. In order to solve this 
problem, in addition to using the best features and algorithms in the previous records, the method of 
collective anomaly detection has been used to pay more attention to the anomaly detection of users 
with several wallet addresses. 

Research method 

3- 
As  mentioned  in  this  research,  the  process  of  anomaly  detection  has  been  done  with  a  collective 
anomaly approach. The details of the proposed method are described below: 

3-1-  Dataset and theft list 

In  this  research,  the  dataset  of  the  "ELTE  Bitcoin  Project"  [20]  has  been  used.  Because  in  the 
previous  records,  the  Bitcoin  Blockchain  dataset  was  used  until  April  7,  2013,  the  initial 
preprocessing was performed on the dataset. The list of addresses that have committed theft, fraud, 
hacking, or loss was then extracted.

3-2-  Preprocessing 

Since the best results in previous records are related to Monamo et al. [11], and they also used the 
14 features listed in Table 1, in this study, investigations were performed on these features, and data 
preprocessing was conducted in the following three general steps: 

  Data wiping: Records that have no input or output are removed. Consequently, the number 

of records is reduced from 13086527 to 10800406. 

  Data aggregation and data size reduction: 

  To  detect  collective  anomalies  in  this  research,  using  the  Contraction  feature,  all  the 
addresses  and  wallets  of  a  user  are  aggregated  to  extract  the  appropriate  features 
according  to  this  aggregation  of  data,  and  as  a  result,  the  number  of  records  reached 
5305678 records. 

  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Considering  that  there  is  a  computational  relationship  between  the  two  In-degree  and 
Out-degree  features,  and  according  to  the  principle  of  data  aggregation,  two  In-degree 
and  Out-degree  features  can  be  eliminated  compared  to  the  method  of  Monamo  et  al. 
[11] 

  Because in many thefts, hack, or fraud cases, the criminals work with multiple addresses 
and wallets to make it difficult to diagnose the anomaly, therefore in the previous works 
that  used  the  method  of  point  anomaly  detection,  two  important  features  of  Clustering 
coefficient and Triangle were used to extract better results by realizing the multiplicity 
of connections between these addresses and wallets. On the other hand, according to the 
new approach of this research in diagnosing collective anomalies of users (with multiple 
addresses and possible wallets) instead of identifying point anomalies of addresses and 
wallets,  two  Clustering  coefficients  and  Triangle  features  which  require  which  high 
computational and operational power can be removed for extraction. 
  Data conversion: The min-max linear method was used to normalize the data.

3-4-  Trimmed K-means algorithm 

One of the most important features of this algorithm is to place α1 percent of the outlier, which is 
very far from other clusters' centers in the 0 cluster. This feature is particularly important in the case 
of the considered problem and anomaly detection. Therefore, the Trimmed K-Means algorithm has 
been  used  for  clustering,  which  is  a  more  robust  method  than  the  basic  K-Means  method,  and 
according to researches, will have better results [21]. 

3-5-  Clustering              

Due  to  a  large  number  of  records  and  data  dimensions  and  also  the  reduction  of  clustering  time, 
Monamo  et  al.  [4]  applied  the  clustering  operation  to  one  million  records,  but  in  the  proposed 
method, due to data aggregation and size reduction, work was made on all records to extract more 
reliable results.  In the proposed method, like the method of Monamo  et  al.  [4], the value of α  is 
equal  to  0.01,  and  the  value  of  k2  is  equal  to  8.  Furthermore,  in  the  end,  the  results  of  all  93 
categories have been examined according to the list of pre-prepared thefts. 

Findings

In this section, the results of the experiment  are presented and discussed  and then compared with 
previous works 

4-1-  Test results  

As  shown  in  Table  4,  the  proposed  method  uses  the  collective  anomaly  detection  method  for  the 
first time compared to previous records. It succeeds in detecting anomalies of users who intend to 
show  their  behavior  usually  by  having  multiple  wallet  addresses,  and  the  proposed  method  was 
successful in detecting 14 users with 26 addresses involved in 9 cases of theft, fraud, hack, or loss.

4-2-  Comparison with previous works 

The following section presents  comparisons of the current  study  with  the  previous works. The 

comparions are based on features, employed algorithms, and the performance of the studies. 

4-2-1-  Comparison of features 

As  shown  in  Table  5,  the  proposed  method  is  placed  in  the  middle  of  the  table  in  terms  of  the 
number of extracted features. At the same time, considering that the proposed method does not use 
the clustering coefficient feature, the extraction of which has a high time complexity; therefore, the 
proposed  method  has  acceptable  performance  in  feature  extraction  in  terms  of  computational  and 
processing power.

Figure 2: Thefts, hacks, scams, and losses detected by various Bitcoin anomaly detection methods 

In  terms  of  the  number  of  features,  the  lowest  number  of  features  is  related  to  Pham  [10].  The 
proposed method is in the middle of the comparison table. Because the proposed method uses the 
diagnosis  of  collective  anomalies,  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  records  has  been  created,  and  in 
general, it has been successful in reducing the dimensions (number of records and features). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In terms of time and operational and computational power, the proposed method  performed better 
than previous records that managed to detect anomalies. 

In  terms  of  the  number  of  algorithms  used  to  detect  anomalies  and  suspicious  transactions,  the 
proposed method using the Trimmed_Kmeans algorithm has performed finely. 
The  most  important  part  of  comparing  the  proposed  method  with  others  is  the  success  in 
performance  and  results.  In  this  regard,  the  proposed  method  has  been  able  to  achieve  the  best 
performance compared to other methods and was able to detect 14 users with 26 addresses (wallets) 
committed  9  cases  of  theft,  fraud,  hack,  or  loss,  and  compared  to  Monamo's  latest  method  [11], 
which was able to find 7 addresses (wallets) that committed 5 thefts, scams, hacks, or losses has a 
much better performance. 

Conclusion and suggestion 

5- 
According  to  the  results,  it  was  found  that  people  who  intend  to  commit  fraud  and  malicious 
activities  in  the  Bitcoin  network  use  several  addresses  and  so-called  digital  wallets  to  normalize 
their activities as a normal user. In a way, these users' activity with multiple addresses makes them 
look  almost  like  a  normal  user.  To  diagnose  this  type  of  anomaly,  which  is  like  an  in-disguise 
anomaly,  one  must  find  a  small  deviation  in  these  users'  behavior.  In  the  previous  works,  the 
anomaly detection was done by extracting new features that rely on the connection between a user's 
digital  wallets.  However,  in  the  proposed  method,  using  collective  anomaly  detection,  the  user's 
digital  wallets  are  aggregated,  and  instead  of  detecting  the  anomaly  of  the  wallet  address,  the 
anomaly of users who own one or more digital wallets was examined. 

On  the  other  hand,  due  to  the  significant  expansion  of  this  network,  it  becomes  very  difficult  to 
extract  features  that  depend  on  high  power  or  computing  time,  and  in  practice,  it  seems  very 
difficult to detect anomalies in this network with these methods. Therefore, to integrate and reduce 
the  problem-solving  dimensions  of  anomaly  detection  in  Blockchain  and  Bitcoin  networks,  four 
features,  two  of  which  had  high  processing  and  computing  power,  were  removed.  The  proposed 
method also uses the Trimmed_KMeans algorithm for clustering, which has a more robust method 
for solving anomaly detection problems than similar algorithms such as the KMeans algorithm. In 
the  end,  the  proposed  method  was  able  to  identify  14  users  who  had  26  known  anomalous 
addresses. Thus, in comparison with the previous methods, in addition to reducing the dimensions 
of the problem from 10800406 records to 5305678 and also from 14 features to 10, the processing 
power and computational time of extracting each feature was also reduced. In addition, in the most 
important  part  of  the  evaluation  and  performance  result,  the  number  of  detected  thefts  increased 
from 5 to 9 compared to the previous best methods, and the number of addresses of the perpetrators 
of theft was increased from 7 to 26. Also, in this method, for the first time, 14 users who committed 
these cases were identified. 

As future works, it is suggested to do new work in two parts in general.  In one step, features and 
algorithms should be selected that requires low computational and operational power to extract and 
execute.  In another step, features and algorithms having the best diagnosis of the anomaly should 
be found.
