(Dated: August 10, 2021)

The minimal gauged U (1)Lµ−Lτ model has long been known to be able to explain the tension be-
tween the theoretical and experimental values of the muon magnetic moment. It has been explored
and tested extensively, pushing the viable parameter space into a very tight corner. Further, embed-
ding the U (1)Lµ−Lτ model in a supersymmetric (SUSY) framework has been shown to relax some of
these constraints and has recently been shown to explain the electron anomalous magnetic moment
as well. In this model, the logarithm of the mass ratio of third to second generation (s)leptons con-
trol the non-negligible kinetic mixing and may crucially alter many of the constraints. We confront
both the non-SUSY and SUSY versions of this class of models with the CsI(2017), the recently
released CENNS10 data from the liquid Argon detector as well as the updated CsI(2020) data of
the COHERENT experiment. We use the recoil energy and timing binned data from CsI(2017) and
the energy, time, and Pulse Shape Discriminator binned data from CENNS10 to ﬁnd estimates for
the model parameters in a likelihood maximization test. We also show updated exclusions using all
of the above data from the COHERENT Collaboration, as well as projected exclusions from the
ongoing Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills experiment. The (g − 2)µ favored values of the U (1)Lµ−Lτ gauge
coupling that are still unconstrained overlap with the estimates from COHERENT data within 1σ.
The combined COHERENT data is found to prefer the presence of the U (1)Lµ−Lτ gauge boson over
the Standard Model at ∼ 1.4σ. The global minima of a chi-square deviation function using CsI(2020)
as well as CENNS10 total counts has signiﬁcant overlap with the (g − 2)µ favored parameter space
in the context of the SUSY and non-SUSY Lµ − Lτ models with a mediator mass in the 20 − 100
MeV range.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The prospect of observing coherent elastic neutrino-
nucleus scattering (CEνNS) was ﬁrst proposed roughly
47 years ago[1]. However, the crucial discovery was of
the fact that the scattering cross-section involved with
the CEνNS process would be many times larger than the
corresponding process with a single nucleon. The CEνNS
cross-section was expected to scale approximately with
the square of the neutron number of the nuclei[1, 2].

In spite of the large predicted event rates, which meant
that detectors with masses as small as a few kilograms
could be used to detect it, CEνNS evaded observation
for four decades, primarily because of the small (few
keV) nuclear recoil energies involved. The COHER-
ENT Collaboration ﬁnally reported its observation of the
process with stopped-pion neutrinos on a CsI detector,
43 years after it was ﬁrst proposed, and the recoil en-
ergy distribution agreed with the Standard Model (SM)
within 1σ. The Collaboration also reported that the two-
dimensional (energy and time) proﬁle, ﬁt to the maxi-
mum likelihood, prefers the presence of CEνNS against

its absence at the 6.7σ conﬁdence level[3]. Henceforth, we
refer to this as the CsI(2017) dataset. This was followed
up by the observation of CEνNS on a liquid Ar detector
which also rejects the absence of CEνNS at 3.5σ with
3D-binned data in their recoil energy, timing, as well
as pulse-shape-discriminator (PSD) data [4]. The CO-
HERENT Collaboration has also recently announced the
impending publication of an update to the initial dataset
from their CsI detector[5], referred to as CsI(2020), which
rejects the absence of CEνNS at 11.6σ. Not only have
these results added to the understanding of neutrino in-
teractions and nuclear form factors[6–12] within the SM,
but they have also provided a benchmark to test any
propositions of physics beyond the SM that altered them.
These results have been used to test several new
physics
in neutrino nonstan-
result
dard interactions (NSI)[13–20] and their electromagnetic
properties[21, 22]. They have also been transcribed into
constraining models involving sterile neutrinos[23–25],
neutrino magnetic moments[8, 26], light dark matter[27,
28] and light vector mediators of new physics[29–33]. We
build upon the method introduced in Ref.[34] to com-
pare the combined observations[35, 36] of the COHER-
ENT Collaboration from both CsI(2017) as well as the
Ar (CENNS10) detectors with the CEνNS prediction in

The Lµ

Lτ model as a viable extension of the SM
has been studied in much detail[37, 38].
It has been
shown to be able to successfully explain the muon mag-
netic moment [39, 40] that has been observed to be at
10−9) from its SM
∼
prediction[43–62]. It has also been used to explain neu-
trino masses and mixing [40, 63–65], dark matter [65–72],
Higgs boson ﬂavor violating decays [73, 74], and B-decay
anomalies [66, 73, 75–77] for diﬀerent choices of the pa-
rameter space that have some intersection amongst them-
selves. The extension was embedded in a SUSY frame-
work and the associated phenomenology was discussed
2)µ, neutrino masses and mixing and
with respect to (g
charged lepton ﬂavor violation in Ref.[78] and dark mat-
ter in Ref.[79]. A more recent study of the SUSY Lµ
Lτ
model shows that both electron and muon anomalous
magnetic moments may be explained simultaneously [80].
The modiﬁcation to the SM CEνNS rate due to the
Lµ
Lτ gauge boson proceeds via the kinetic mixing ((cid:15)), a
necessarily small parameter ((cid:46) 10−5). As a consequence,
the modiﬁcation is dominated by the interference term,
which is destructive as long as the sum of the u- and
d-quark beyond the Standard Model (BSM) couplings to
the neutrinos remain positive. This holds for all but a few
pathological parameter choices for the U (1)Lµ−Lτ model.
This is owing to the fact that these couplings in the Lµ
−
Lτ model are proportional to (cid:15)Qem. While the presence
of the Lµ
Lτ gauge boson thus serves to reduce the
CEνNS rate, the CsI detector has observed a count lower
than that predicted by the SM and the Ar detector has
reported an opposite trend. It is true that both results
are within 1σ of the SM prediction, still, a more rigorous
analysis involving the full energy as well as timing data

has shown that the CsI data prefers new physics scenarios
that lead to a reduction of the number of counts at
∼
2σ[34]. We re-evaluate the situation in the light of the
recent Ar data adding a pull in the opposite direction.

−

Our analysis ﬁnds that although the preference for de-
structive BSM eﬀects has a marked reduction, it still re-
mains slightly larger than 1σ. We use our analysis to
show updated exclusions on the Lµ
Lτ parameter space.
The exclusions from the Ar data are much stronger than
the corresponding exclusions from CsI(2017), however
the exclusions from the combined data adhere closely to
those from the CsI(2017) data. The CsI(2020) combined
with the Ar data lays much stronger bounds than the
former, still; they are not the strongest constraints in the
relevant parameter space. However, the preferred region
of parameter space from the likelihood test, as well as
the global minima of the chi-square deviation has signif-
2)µ preferred region in the
icant overlap with the (g
context of the Lµ
Lτ model. In addition, we also show
projected exclusions from the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills
(CCM)[81, 82] experiment which is another experiment
looking for CEνNS with stopped-pion neutrinos on a liq-
uid Ar detector. In comparison with the COHERENT
experiment, CCM uses a less intense neutrino beam but
5 tons as
has a much larger detector ﬁducial volume (
opposed to
24 kgs at COHERENT). In case the CCM
observations correspond to the SM predictions, the ex-
clusions would be the strongest to date in the pertinent
region of the parameter space.

This results in a distinct timing spectra for the incoming
neutrinos at the SNS as shown in Fig.1(b).

Data from the observation of CEνNS at two diﬀerent
detectors has been made public by the COHERENT Col-
laboration to date: the CsI and the CENNS10 liquid Ar
detectors.

A. Backgrounds

For both detectors, there are two broad classes of back-
grounds that aﬀect the analysis. The ﬁrst, steady state
backgrounds, are present in both beam-on and beam-
oﬀ data and may be handled using prescribed methods
of background subtraction as described in Refs.[4, 35].
The second, beam-related-neutrons (BRN) and neutrino-
induced-neutrons (NIN) occur in time with the SNS
beam and are hence more diﬃcult to separate. The BRN
can be further classiﬁed into prompt and delayed BRN,
the former are the fast neutrons produced by the SNS
target itself while the latter are produced by the neu-
trinos interacting with the detector shielding. Both of
these backgrounds generate events similar in nature to
the CEνNS events and need to be correctly accounted
for. The COHERENT Collaboration uses the diﬀerent
recoil energy and timing distributions for these events to
discriminate between this background and the CEνNS
signal.

The COHERENT Collaboration has released data
from dedicated measurements of both the kinds of back-
grounds for CsI as well as CENNS10 detectors. In our
analyses we compare the total observed counts with the
model prediction added to these background counts us-
ing appropriate uncertainties for all the distributions.
This is consistent with the method used by the Collab-
oration itself to generate the best-ﬁt CEνNS and back-
ground counts. As a cross-check, we use our method
to re-evaluate these best-ﬁt counts and ﬁnd a very close
match with those reported by the Collaboration.

B. CsI

This was the ﬁrst CEνNS detector installed at the SNS
and it was composed of a 14.6Kg CsI[Na] crystal. It was
installed at a distance of 19.3 m from the neutrino source
at 90◦ to the proton beam direction. It could detect nu-
clear recoil energies as small as 4.25 keV although the

tion of neutrino ﬂux (10%), nuclear form factor (5%),

tainties. The COHERENT Collaboration has recently
announced the publication of additional data from the
CsI detector[5], however only the total CEνNS and back-
ground counts have been made public along with the re-
spective uncertainties. We use the public data from the

analysis (discussed in Sec.V) and the recently announced
total counts in a χ2 test.

certainties for a total of 13%. This is an uncertainty on
the CEνNS rate prediction and is called the prediction
uncertainty for the rest of this work. The second set in-
cludes uncertainties in the F90 energy dependence(4.5%),
neutrino arrival time(2.7%), BRN energy shape(5.8%),
BRN arrival time-mean(1.3%), and BRN arrival time-
width(3.1%) and leads to a total uncertainty of 8.5% on
the CEνNS best-ﬁt value. This set will be referred to
as the ﬁt uncertainty. Public data from the CENNS10
detector is used in a likelihood as well as an χ2 test in
conjunction with the observations from the CsI detector.

The COHERENT Collaboration has recently an-
nounced the publication of additional data from its CsI
20 events against an
detector [5] that has observed 306
SM prediction of 333
42(ex). While the full de-
tails of the observation have not been made public yet, we
have enough information to conduct a preliminary anal-
ysis with it. The Collaboration has updated its signal
prediction as well as the CEνNS data analysis which has
lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in the overall uncertainty
of the signal from 28% to 13%. This has also resulted in
a reduction in both the predicted and observed CEνNS
count.

The update releases data taken on the CsI[Na] detector
until June 2019, which amounts to
more protons
on target compared to the previous CsI data release. In
the absence of detailed quenching factor and eﬃciency
information from the new analysis, we use those from
the previous data release. According to the Collabora-
tion, the new analysis leads to a
9% reduction in the
SM prediction for the CsI(2017) dataset. We ﬁnd that
the predicted signal for the CsI(2020) dataset using the
earlier methods requires
14% reduction to match the
new SM prediction released by the Collaboration. We
also have information on the steady state background

In our analysis we deﬁne the total chi-square deviation as
the sum of the two individual ones and minimize the chi-
square deviation over the α and β nuisance parameters.

III. CEνNS AT CCM

∼

The proposed CCM experiment is designed to detect
CEνNS on a liquid Argon detector with a
5 ton ﬁducial
mass using neutrinos from the Lujan target at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory [81–83]. The detector is
placed 20 m from the Lujan target that produces
0.04
neutrinos per ﬂavor per POT. The Lujan facility uses
an 800 MeV proton beam impinging upon a tungsten
target at 20 Hz to produce pions that decay and produce
neutrinos with the same energy shape as those at the
SNS.

∼

Since we have only the total observed counts for both
the signal and background in the new dataset, adopting a

We assume 5000 hours of operation per year, for three
1022

years, for our analysis which is approximately 3

×

POT for the entire period. In the absence of any quench-
ing factor, eﬃciency, or background information we only
use a detector threshold of 25 keV and the CEνNS count
alone for evaluating the projected exclusions. The detec-
tor eﬃciency above the threshold was kept at 100% and a
1 PE/keVnr quenching factor was used for our analysis.
This was done for the sake of easy scalability once the
full data from the detector becomes available.

IV. SIGNAL PREDICTION

In this section we shall describe the CEνNS cross sec-
tion as it arises in the SM, discuss how it may be modiﬁed
in the Lµ
Lτ model (in both the presence and absence
of SUSY), and describe how we generate the signal pre-
diction for the experiments.

In coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering events, the mo-
mentum transfer between the neutrino and the nucleus is
smaller than or comparable to inverse the size of the nu-
cleus [Er (cid:46)
(50) MeV]. The axial vector contribution
to this process is proportional to the nucleus spin [13],
and hence is negligible in comparison to the vector con-
tribution. The cross section for CEνNS scattering on
a nucleus of mass mN , atomic number Z, and neutron
number N is

The form factor F (q) is a description of the nu-
cleon distribution within the nucleus and follows from its
Fourier transform. It is captured by several parametriza-
tions, e.g., the Helm [84], Symmetrized Fermi [85], and
Klein Nystrand [86] approaches. Sticking to the con-
ventions adopted by the COHERENT Collaboration in
their own analysis of CsI and CENNS10 data, we use the
Helm and Klein-Nystrand parametrizations for the two
detectors, respectively. Note, however, that the choice of
form factor parametrization has little or no eﬀect on the
results obtained.

The Helm form factor can be described by

and A, Z, and N are the mass number, atomic number,

(Cs, I, or Ar in our case, depending on the detector).
The two terms in Eq.17 represent the u-quark and d-
quark couplings to the neutrinos multiplied by (A+Z)
and (A+N) respectively and diﬀer only by their electro-
magnetic charge. Note that in our case, owing to the
inherent smallness of (cid:15) and hence QBSM
, the interfer-
ence term 2QSM
in the diﬀerential cross-section
dominates over the pure BSM part of it. Moreover, since

long as the right hand side of eqn.17 remains positive.

This holds for the Lµ
Lτ model except for a few patho-
logical parameter choices since the u-ν BSM coupling is
positive and twice the d-ν coupling, which is negative.
Thus, the CEνNS count suﬀers a reduction in this model.
Figure 3(b) illustrates this eﬀect for a choice of the
Lµ
Lτ parameters. The black solid line in this ﬁg-
ure denotes the SM prediction of the diﬀerential CEνNS
event rate at the CENNS10 detector of the COHERENT
experiment. The red dashed line shows the same in the
Lτ Z (cid:48) with the gauge cou-
presence of a 20 MeV Lµ
10−4 and the SUSY contribution
pling (gx) set to 5.6
to (cid:15) taken to be vanishing. This choice of parameters can
explain (g
2)µ,e in the presence of SUSY [80] and does
not predict an observable charged lepton ﬂavor-violating
decay width, even when neutrino masses and mixing may
be explained in conjunction [78].

The presence of kinetic mixing that mediates the Z (cid:48)
contribution to CEνNS may be assumed to be vanishing
at the tree level, but it is unavoidably generated radia-
tively. In particular, the one-loop kinetic mixing in this
class of models may be non-negligible in spite of super-
heavy BSM ﬁelds entering the loops [87],

This expression for (cid:15) involves both charged leptons and
their scalar superpartners. As discussed in Ref.[87], this
quantity stands out in its dependence on only the ratio
of the (s)lepton masses. While the ratio of the second
and third generation leptons are ﬁxed, we take the ratio
r = m˜τ /m˜µ as an additional model parameter. In the ab-
sence of SUSY, only the ﬁrst term contributes, as would
be the case for degenerate sleptons (r = 1) even in its
presence. It also assumes left-right degeneracy amongst
the charged sleptons for the sake of simplicity. Relaxing
these assumptions would only lead to the dependence of (cid:15)
on additional mass ratios beyond r. We use Eq.18 to pro-
vide the value of (cid:15) in the replacement deﬁned in Eq.16 in
order to generate the modiﬁed diﬀerential cross section.
For both Eqs.16 and 18, the transferred momentum is
q2 = 2MN Er, where MN is the nuclear mass and Er is
the nuclear recoil energy. For the mediator mass (MZ(cid:48))
Lτ model ((cid:46) 1
regime that is pertinent for the Lµ
GeV), q2 is comparable to M 2
Z(cid:48). Unlike general neutrino
NSIs, the BSM modiﬁcation to the CEνNS rate is thus
nuclear recoil energy dependent. The signal shape in the
Er space due to this variation is taken into account by
our likelihood function in the ensuing comparison. For a
study of the impact of CEνNS observations on neutrino
NSI parameter space see, for example, Ref. [88].

where, mdet is the detector mass, NA is the Avogadro’s
number, mmol is the molar mass of the detector molecule
and gmol is the number of atoms in a single detector
molecule.

The presence of beyond-SM coupling of the neutrinos
to quarks modiﬁes the SM CEνNS rate. For opposite sign
couplings of the neutrinos to up- and down- type quarks,
as is the case in the presence of an Lµ
Lτ gauge boson,
this eﬀect is destructive as long as the two couplings are
similar in magnitude. As a result, the presence of the
Lµ
Lτ gauge boson serves to reduce the SM CEνNS
rate for much of the parameter space, especially for low
nuclear recoil energies [see Fig.3(b)]. Once the nuclear
recoil energy spectrum has been generated, we use the
timing and F90 distributions shown in Figs.1(b), 2(b),
and 2(c) to generate the full experimental prediction for
the respective detectors.

V. LIKELIHOOD TEST

This section describes the statistical analysis compar-
ing the model predictions with experimental data from
the COHERENT Collaboration. We adopt the method
described in Ref.[34] for the analysis of the CsI data us-
ing both energy and time binning. We build upon this
to devise a method to test our model against the full 3D-
binned CENNS10 data as well, the goal being an analysis
using combined CsI and CENNS10 data binned in recoil
energy and timing as well as PSD observables.

While deﬁning the likelihood function for the CsI as
well as CENNS10 data, we assume that the total count
(CEνNS + background) follows a Poisson distribution in
each bin. The model prediction added to the observed
background counts acts as the parameter for the Poisson
distributions used. The likelihood function is marginal-
ized over the uncertainties in each of the separate dis-
tributions assuming a Gaussian envelope. In case of the
CsI analysis, the observed background count is taken to
follow a Poisson distribution with a hypothetical param-
eter NBG, that is marginalized. In the absence of clear
uncertainties on the observed background count, this ap-
proach takes into account the statistical errors associated
with this observation. Note that the uncertainties in each
bin are marginalized over separately while building the
likelihood function. This ensures that the signal shape
information over all the free parameters ((cid:126)θ) is accounted
for while comparing the predicted and observed data.

are the parameter for the Poisson distribution, the Pois-

CEνNS model prediction in each bin. The dummy vari-
able α is used to marginalize the likelihood in each bin
over the prediction uncertainty using a Gaussian enve-
lope with standard deviation σα = 0.28.

The likelihood function for the CENNS10 data is de-
ﬁned with the same basic principles in mind. Unlike the
CsI data, it has signiﬁcantly large BRN observations that
must be taken into consideration. The CENNS10 Datare-
lease [4] also provides the uncertainties associated with
each of the three background components, that can now
be incorporated directly. The likelihood function for the
CENNS10 data is deﬁned to be,

where NSS, NpBRN , and NdBRN are the steady state,
prompt BRN and delayed BRN background counts, re-
spectively, in each bin. Just as in the case for CsI, the
parameters, αi, are each the dummy variables that are
marginalized to replicate uncertainties in each of the re-
spective distributions as described in the ﬁrst column of
Table I. Only the prediction uncertainty (13%) is con-
sidered for the CEνNS count when estimating the model
parameters.

L

In order to check the robustness of

Ar, we use it in
repeating the likelihood maximization test described in
Analysis A of Ref.[4]. Instead of marginalizing over the
parameters αi, we pass them as parameters to be esti-
mated by maximizing the likelihood function in Eq. 23
without the Gaussian envelopes. We use the SM predic-
tion of CEνNS for the values of N ((cid:126)θ) and a uniform prior
on its normalization, α1. For the backgrounds, we use
predicted counts instead of the best-ﬁt counts as central
values (as provided in Table I of Ref.[4]) and Gaussian
priors on their normalizations with standard deviations

σpBRN = 0.3
σdBRN = 1.0.

(25)

The standard deviation for the prior on the steady state
background normalization was taken to be the same as
the uncertainty on its predicted value. The results of
this table are shown in the second column of Table I.
For comparison, we also show the corresponding best-
ﬁt values and the errors as reported by the COHERENT
Collaboration and we ﬁnd them to be an excellent match.
Coming back to the estimation of model parameters
using the likelihood functions deﬁned in Eqs. 21 and 23,
the combined likelihood function was deﬁned to be the
product of the two separate ones,

We use this likelihood function in two sets of maximiza-

rameter and another where (cid:126)θ
(gx, MZ(cid:48)). The ratio r is
taken as a ﬁxed parameter for both analyses. We always
use noninformative priors on the estimated parameters
((cid:126)θ) and maximize the likelihood using the MultiNest al-
gorithm [89].

lines correspond to the non-SUSY model (which in this
case is the same as the case for degenerate sleptons). The
eﬀect of nonvanishing contribution from SUSY sources is
captured entirely by choosing other values of r. We show
the results for two representative values of r besides the
r = 1 result, r = 0.01 and r = 100. These choices capture
a wide range of the most common choices for the slepton
mass hierarchies.

CsI(2020)+CENNS10 data from the COHERENT Collaboration. The insets show the global minima of the chi-square proﬁle
which are for nonzero values of the additional gauge boson couplings. Larger choices of MZ(cid:48) beget larger values of preferred gx
and also lead to an additional region of preference at large gx. For perspective, we also show the range of gx that can explain
(g − 2)µ (cyan), as well as those values for it that are constrained by experiments like CCFR [91], Borexino [92] and BaBar [93]
(gray). Only the unbinned total event counts from the detectors are used for this test. The SM is within 1σ of the best ﬁt
value of gx.

range of gx favored by (g
2)µ is entirely within 1σ of
−
the MLE while the SM is beyond the 1σ C.L. Also, larger
values of the stau to smuon mass ratio (r) are slightly
preferred over their degeneracy (which is the same as the
absence of SUSY in this case) or smaller values. They
also have narrower uncertainties, which denotes a better
ﬁt to data, and a better overlap with the (g
2)µ range.
All the 1σ intervals of the ﬁt estimates for gx and the
deviation of the corresponding MLE from the SM are
shown in Table II.

−

The gx dependence of the chi-square deviation as de-
scribed in Sec. II D for ﬁxed values of MZ(cid:48) and r = 1
are shown in Fig. 5. The chi-square deviation is deﬁned
using total counts only as the full energy-time binned
CsI(2020) data is still not in the public domain. The
insets in the ﬁgures show the variation of the function
around its global minima. As in the previous test, we
ﬁnd that the global minima coincides with the (g
2)µ
preferred parameter range for the choices of 20 MeV(cid:46)
MZ(cid:48) (cid:46)100 MeV. The global minima of the chi-square
10−3 for MZ(cid:48) = 20MeV
proﬁle is at 3.2
and 100MeV, respectively, which are within the range of
2)µ observations. This
couplings allowed from the (g
100
implies that the band of gauge boson masses from 20
−
MeV better ﬁts the observations of the COHERENT Col-
laboration than the SM while also explaining (g
2)µ in
tandem. There is an additional minima for larger values
of gx that becomes the global minima for MZ(cid:48) (cid:38) 200 MeV
but these choices are already ruled out by observations
from the experiments mentioned earlier. In contrast to
the likelihood proﬁles, the χ2 test does not exclude the
SM at the 1σ C.L. This distinction is most important as

10−4 and 1.3

the likelihood test uses both energy and timing distribu-
tions from both detectors while the χ2 test uses only the
total counts. However the latter also includes the latest
CsI(2020) data while the former does not. Whether the
full updated data in a likelihood analysis still has the
preference for BSM physics will be clear once the Collab-
oration makes the data public.

We also show the results of the likelihood maximiza-
tion test where both gx and MZ(cid:48) are estimated parame-
ters and the ratio r is ﬁxed. The results of this analysis
are summarized in Fig.6 where the three diﬀerent pan-
els demonstrate the eﬀect of three diﬀerent choices of r.
Once again, we use three representative values, r = 0.01
[Fig. 6(a)], r = 1 [Fig. 6(b)], and r = 100 [Fig.6(c)].
The color code denotes the variation of the PDF. Since
the MultiNest algorithm rejects parameter points over
iterations by importance sampling, regions of lower like-
lihood also have a lower density of ﬁnal reported likeli-
hood points. The red shaded region in these ﬁgures de-
note the parameter space preferred by the COHERENT
data within 1σ. We also show the (g
2)µ preferred and
already constrained parameter space in these ﬁgures.

−

There are a few features of these results that are com-
mon across all the choices of r. The SM (gx = 0) is always
within 2σ of the MLE, however there is a slight preference
for nonzero Lµ
Lτ gauge coupling. Although the MLE
is always in regions of the parameter space that have
already been excluded by experiments like CCFR [91],
Borexino [92] and BaBar [93], unconstrained regions of
the parameter space where the (g
2)µ may be explained
are within 1σ of it. Changing the value of r aﬀects the
estimated most likely value of gx. Larger values of r pre-

fer smaller values of gX and vice versa. Larger values of
r also bring the preferred values of gx into better overlap
with those favored by (g
2)µ. At the same time, larger
values of this ratio are also associated with a slightly
larger likelihood. However, the logarithmic dependence
of (cid:15) on r ensures that these dependencies are quite mild
as we go for even larger values than 100.

−

The exclusions from these analyses using the method
outlined in Sec. V are shown in Fig. 7. The exclusions
from the CENNS10 analysis are far stronger than those
from CsI(2017). This is because it observed an excess of
Lτ ) Z (cid:48) serves to
events above the SM while the (Lµ
reduce the count for the relevant parameter space. The
2σ preference for a Z (cid:48) cou-
CsI(2017) data alone has a
∼
pling exclusively to second generation leptons [34], lead-
ing to a smaller CEνNS count than the SM prediction.
Although this preference has a marked reduction in the
combined data, it does survive. As a result, the exclu-

−

sions from the combined data closely follow those from
CsI(2017) alone. These exclusions have been shown keep-
ing the ratio r = 1 ﬁxed. Since larger ratios show a pref-
erence for smaller values of gx, they also correspond to
stronger exclusions. However, as mentioned earlier, the
dependence of the kinetic mixing on this ratio is logarith-
mic. Hence, the change in the exclusions get smaller and
smaller for larger values of r. The 95% conﬁdence level
exclusion from the chi-square proﬁle on the gx-MZ(cid:48) plane
is also shown in Fig. 7. These constraints are stronger
than the existing ones from the CEνNS detection by the
Collaboration, however they are not the strongest in the
relevant parameter space.

In addition we also show the projected exclusion from
the CCM experiment. Since we have no information for
the backgrounds for this experiment yet, we assume that
the CEνNS count itself has a Poisson distribution in each
bin. We also use a detector threshold of 25 keV and

spective Z (cid:48) masses and are also unconstrained. An addi-
tional minima for larger values of gx is distinct especially
for a heavier Z (cid:48). This additional minima becomes the
global minima for MZ(cid:48) (cid:38) 200 MeV, however the choice
of this parameter space is constrained by the observations
of the CCFR and BaBar Collaborations. A
1.3σ pref-
erence for reductive BSM eﬀect as well as an overlap with
the (g
2)µ favored parameter space within 1σ was also
observed from the likelihood proﬁle of the CsI(2017)+
CENNS10 energy, timing and PSD distribution. An im-
portant distinction between the two diﬀerent analyses is
that the likelihood proﬁle has no overlap with the SM at
the 1σ C.L. In contrast, the χ2 test using only the total
counts from CsI(2020)+CENNS10 data has an overlap
with the SM within 1σ despite the global minima mildly
preferring nonzero new physics contribution.

The exclusions from the CENNS10 data that observed
an excess of counts over the SM CEνNS prediction are
much stronger than the earlier CsI exclusions on the
Lτ parameter space. However, the surviving pref-
Lµ
erence for reductive BSM eﬀects results in the exclu-
sions from the combined data to closely adhere to the
CsI ones. The exclusions from the combined CENNS10
and CsI(2020) total counts using a χ2-test are stronger
than the CsI(2017) + CENNS10 exclusions, but are still
weaker than those coming from the CENNS10 data alone.
Still, neither the CENNS10 exclusions by themselves or
those from the combined data are the strongest exclu-
sions as far as the Lµ
Lτ model is concerned. We also
show the projected exclusions from the CCM experiment.
Assuming it observes the SM prediction for CEνNS , it
might be able to exclude yet unconstrained regions of the
parameter space favored by the (g

−

2)µ.

Some of the other upcoming CEνNS experiments also
look promising in this regard. For instance, the planned
610 kg extension (CENNS610) of the CENNS10 LAr de-
tector at the SNS would be able to signiﬁcantly improve
statistics on the existing data. The experiments at ESS
and especially ESS10 [95] with its strikingly low thresh-
old energy are expected to probe large parts of the model
parameter space including those that can explain the
present (g
2)µ measurements. Other experiments like
the NA64µ[96, 97] muon beam experiment, the NA62[98]
Kaon factory and liquid Xenon direct Dark Matter de-
tectors like the LZ[99], XENONnT[100] and the DAR-
WIN observatory[101] also have promising capabilities
to probe regions of the U (1)Lµ−Lτ parameter space per-
2)µ. For a recent study of projected
tinent to the (g
Lτ pa-

CsI(2017), CENNS10 and their combination on the Lµ − Lτ
parameter space are shown. Projected exclusions from the
CCM experiment assuming three years of data taking are also
shown. The exclusions shown are for r = 1, which also corre-
sponds to the non-SUSY case. Larger values of r would lead
to stronger constraints. The exclusions on the same parame-
ter space from the analysis of the chi-square deviation using
the CENNS10 and updated CsI(2020) total counts are also

above that we use 100% eﬃciency and a quenching fac-
tor of 1PE/keV for easy scalability once the information
is available. We have used signal predictions using a pro-
jected live-period of
5000hrs/year for three years which
∼
1022 protons on target. We modify
correspond to
the likelihood function in Eq. 23 suitably by setting the
background counts to zero. We also have no informa-
tion on the associated systematic uncertainties for it, and
hence we do not use the dummy variables for marginal-
ization over errors. The only possible error that could
2% theoretical error on the CEνNS
be included is the
prediction. However these are too small to cause any sig-
niﬁcant change to our results and hence are disregarded.
Assuming that the CCM experiment observes a CEνNS
count equal to the SM prediction, it could potentially
exclude hitherto unconstrained portions of the Lµ
Lτ
parameter space. More importantly, it may be able to
exclude a portion of the parameter space favored by the
(g
2)µ observations. Similar sensitivities in constraining
neutrino NSI from the CCM experiment have also been
observed by the authors of Ref. [94].

VII. CONCLUSION

We undertook a comprehensive statistical analysis of
the combined CsI and CENNS10 data recently made pub-
lic by the COHERENT Collaboration. The full energy
and timing data from the CsI detector as well as the
energy, timing and PSD data from the CENNS10 detec-
tor was used to estimate the best-ﬁt parameters for the

0.51.01.52.02.53.0log10(MZ0/MeV)4.03.53.02.52.01.51.0log10(gX)Borexino 95% C.L.CCFR 95% C.L.BABAR 95% C.L.CsI(2017) 2 C.L.Ar 2 C.L.CCM 2 C.L.CsI(2017)+Ar 2 C.L.(g2) 2CsI(2020)+Ar 2 C.L.rameter space see, for example, Ref.[102]. Observation
of neutrino tridents at the DUNE near detector is also
projected to be able to improve upon the CCFR obser-
vations and probe the (g
2)µ favored parameter space
of the Lµ

Lτ model[103, 104].

The formalism for the SUSY scenario was kept the
same as that in Ref. [80]. Our analysis ﬁnds that the
range of gx favoured by (g
2)µ,e in this scenario overlaps
with the estimates of gx from the likelihood maximization
within 1σ. We also ﬁnd that larger values of the ratio r
have better overlap with this range of gx and is slightly
more favored by the combined data.

This exercise also points towards the fact that the com-
bined COHERENT data still prefers BSM eﬀects that
serve to reduce the CEνNS count predicted from the SM,
although to a lesser degree than with the CsI data alone.
The CsI(2017) data preferred reductive BSM eﬀects via
