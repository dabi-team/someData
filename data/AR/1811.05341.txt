In a seminal article, Fano predicts that absorption of light occurs preferably with increase of angu-
lar momentum. Here we generalize Fano’s propensity rule to laser-assisted photoionization, consist-
ing of absorption of an extreme-ultraviolet photon followed by absorption or emission of an infrared
photon. The predicted asymmetry between absorption and emission leads to incomplete quantum
interference in attosecond photoelectron interferometry. It explains both the angular-dependence of
the photoionization time delays and the delay-dependence of the photoelectron angular distributions.
Our theory is veriﬁed by experimental results in Ar in the 20-40 eV range.

In quantum mechanics, the possible transitions be-
tween diﬀerent states are dictated by selection rules
which are based on symmetry arguments. For example,
the famous parity and angular momentum selection rules
are at the core of our understanding of light-matter in-
teractions. In contrast to these stringent selection rules,
the concept of propensity rules, which was introduced by
Berry [1], is based on the fact that all allowed transitions
are not equally probable. Selection and propensity rules
play a fundamental role in physics and chemistry to un-
derstand reaction outcomes and probabilities. One of the
most fundamental reactions is the photoionization of an
atom following the absorption of a high energy photon,
A + γ → A+
+ e−, where an electron is promoted to a man-
ifold of degenerate continuum states. The well-known
electric dipole selection rules greatly simplify the prob-
lem, restricting the possible transitions to those where
the electron angular momentum changes by one unit,
∆(cid:96) = ±1. Fano’s propensity rule states that out of the
two possible transitions, the one increasing the electron
angular momentum is favored, due to increase of the cen-
trifugal potential with angular momentum [2].

This Letter deals with laser-assisted photoionization,
+ e−, where absorption of an ex-
A + γXUV ± γIR → A+
treme ultraviolet (XUV) photon brings an electron to the
continuum, followed by absorption or stimulated emis-
sion of infrared (IR) laser radiation between continuum
states. Laser-assisted photoionization is a cornerstone
of attosecond science, used in the temporal characteri-
zation of XUV radiation, such as high-order harmonics
[3–5] and the measurement of attosecond pulses using
the reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference
of two-photon transitions (RABBIT) scheme [6, 7]. This
technique is used in many applications, especially the in-
vestigation of photoionization dynamics in atoms [8–12],
molecules [13–16] and solids [17–19]. A natural question
is whether Fano’s propensity rule, originally stated be-
tween bound and continuum states, can be extended to
laser-assisted photoionization and how a possible asym-
metry between absorption and emission aﬀects attosec-

ond photoemission measurements.

Recently, attosecond experimental observations have
been extended to include angle resolution, with the aim
to provide information on multiple competing channels
[20]. These studies show that the measured photoioniza-
tion time delays strongly depend on the electron emis-
sion angle [21, 22]. Conversely, the photoelectron angu-
lar distributions (PAD) vary as a function of the delay
between the attosecond pulse train and the probe ﬁeld
[22, 23]. Modiﬁcations of PADs with pump-probe delay
have been theoretically predicted [24, 25] and the an-
gular dependence of the photoionization time delays in
RABBIT measurements has been reproduced in several
numerical calculations [21, 26–30]. Nonetheless, the un-
derlying physical origin of these eﬀects is still not under-
stood.

Here, we demonstrate that Fano’s propensity rule can
be generalized to laser-assisted photoionization in atoms.
Subsequently, we show that the asymmetry between ab-
sorption and emission leads to incomplete quantum in-
terference in the RABBIT scheme which is at the ori-
gin of the delay-dependence of the PADs and the angle-
dependence of the photoionization time delays. Finally,
we verify our theoretical predictions by comparing with
experimental results obtained in argon.

Our theoretical approach is based on angular-channel-
resolved many-body perturbation theory. The two-
photon transition matrix elements corresponding to ab-
th harmonic followed by absorption
sorption of the (s ∓ 1)
or emission of a fundamental IR photon with angular
frequency ω are calculated according to (we use atomic
units: ̵h = m = e = 4πε0 = 1 unless stated otherwise)

or emission of the IR photon. The common linear polar-
ization of XUV and IR ﬁelds, along the z axis, ensures
conservation of the magnetic quantum number, m. The
amplitudes of the XUV and IR ﬁelds are set to one for
simplicity. Our calculations are based on a one-electron
Hamiltonian, with a Dirac-Fock potential plus a correc-
tion that ensures the correct long-range potential for ion-
ized photoelectrons [28]. Electron correlation eﬀects are
included by self-consistent changes in the interaction, δz,
known as the Random Phase Approximation with Ex-
change (RPAE), for absorption of the XUV photon [31].

Figure 1(a) presents ratios between two-photon matrix
elements corresponding to increasing or decreasing angu-
lar momentum in the IR absorption process, from the
same intermediate state in the continuum. The ratios,
calculated for various noble gas atoms ionized from dif-
ferent shells [outer shell of helium (1s), neon (2p) and
argon (3p), or inner-shell of krypton (3d)], are generally
larger than one, which means that IR absorption is more
probable towards higher angular momentum. These ra-
tios are to a large extent atom-independent, only showing
a dependence on the ﬁnal electron energy and the inter-
mediate angular momentum. Figure 1 also compares ab-
sorption and emission from the same intermediate con-
tinuum state. The absorption/emission ratio is larger
than one when angular momentum is increased, λ → λ+1
[Fig. 1(b)], while the emission/absorption ratio is larger
than one when angular momentum is decreased, λ → λ−1
[Fig. 1(c)], thus reﬂecting the time-reversal symmetry of
the laser-driven continuum transition.

Similar to the case of one-photon transitions between
bound and continuum states, discussed by Fano [2], the
physical origin of the propensity rule can be understood
by evaluating the radial part of the transition matrix
elements. The strength of the transition between the

√

intermediate and ﬁnal states is largest when the diﬀer-
2[E − V (r)]
ence between the local momenta k(r) =
is smallest. (Here E is the electron kinetic energy and
V (r) the radial potential). Hence, in the case of ab-
sorption (emission) of a photon, increasing (decreasing)
angular momentum is favored because the increased (de-
creased) kinetic energy of the electron is compensated by
a larger (smaller) centrifugal potential. In addition, the
asymmetry between absorption and emission increases
with angular momentum, since the centrifugal potential
varies as L(L + 1).

It should be pointed out that there is also a competing
eﬀect, due to the angular momentum part of the transi-
tion matrix elements, which always favours lowering the
angular momentum.
Indeed, in Fig. 1(a), at energies
larger than 20 eV, Fano’s propensity rule is violated in
the case of absorption of a photon from an intermediate
p continuum.
In this case, the centrifugal potential is
much smaller than the electron kinetic energy, leading to
a small radial eﬀect. Here the angular eﬀect takes over,
leading to a ratio slightly lower than one. Conversely, the
ratios over diﬀerent ﬁnal angular momenta for emission
of a photon in the continuum show larger asymmetry, be-
cause both radial and angular eﬀects favour the decrease
of angular momentum (not shown). In Fig. 1(b) and (c)
the ratios are always larger than one because ﬁnal states
with the same angular momentum are compared.

The RABBIT technique relies on the interference of
two-photon transitions using an XUV attosecond pulse
train, consisting in a comb of odd-order harmonics and
a weak phase-locked IR ﬁeld [7]. The strength of the
created sideband (SB), PSB, photoelectron peaks oscil-
lates with the delay, τ , between the XUV and IR ﬁelds
according to

PSB(τ ) = a + b cos (2ωτ + δϕ).

τA = −δϕ/2ω [9]. In the case of angle-resolved measure-
ments, the coeﬃcients a, b and the phase oﬀset δϕ depend
on the emission angle θ [21, 22].

where Pn are Legendre polynomials, βn are the so-called

For two-photon transitions, the sum can be stopped at
n = 4 and β1 = β3 = 0 because the ﬁnal states have the
same parity, giving rise to an up-down symmetric PAD
described by β2 and β4 [32, 33]. In the case of RABBIT
measurements, the sideband PAD, PSB(θ, τ ), can be de-
scribed by Eq. (3), with delay-dependent asymmetry pa-
rameters, β2(τ ), β4(τ ). Using a partial wave expansion,

We now consider RABBIT in He, where only one inter-

In angle-integrated measurements, the orthogonality of
the spherical harmonics leads to an incoherent sum of
the two ﬁnal momenta contributions (L = 0, 2) in Eq. (7).
Since there is only one intermediate angular momen-
tum, these terms will oscillate in phase provided that

the continuum–continuum phases, φ

on L. Hence, a unique photoionization time delay can be
accurately extracted [9, 34].

We now consider angle-resolved RABBIT. At high ki-
netic energy, referred to as the soft-photon regime [35],
absorption and emission amplitudes are symmetrical, i.e.

At lower kinetic energy (≲ 30 eV), previous approxi-
mations are not valid, and a rigorous treatment requires
careful account of interfering terms in Eq. (7). Figure
2(a) shows the evolution of the asymmetry parameters
of SB 20 in He for delays spanning one SB oscillation pe-
riod as well as the corresponding PADs at speciﬁc delays.
The PAD varies strongly as a function of the delay, with
a periodic emission of electrons perpendicular to the laser
polarization. This can be understood by comparing the

relative weight of the s and d contributions, ∣AL0(τ )∣
as a function of delay [Fig. 2(b)]. Around the SB maxi-
mum, the two contributions are comparable, while at the
SB minimum, the s state contribution drops signiﬁcantly
and the d state becomes dominant, resulting in a strong
modiﬁcation of the PAD. The asymmetry between ab-
sorption and emission leads to incomplete quantum in-
terference and reduction of the contrast of the oscilla-
2 remains diﬀerent from zero). This eﬀect is

by Fano’s propensity rule.

tively at speciﬁc angles, leading to a π phase jump of the
argument of A(±)
(θ). As shown in Fig. 3, the absorption
path to SB 14 presents strong destructive interference at
75○ and 105○ indicating that A(+)
(θ) undergoes a π phase
jump [see supplemental material (SM)]. In contrast, the
emission path does not exhibit any destructive interfer-
ence and varies smoothly as a function of angle. This be-
haviour also results from the asymmetry between absorp-
tion and emission explained by the generalized Fano’s
propensity rule.

In Fig. 3, the calculated atomic delay does not depend
much on the emission angle, except at the positions close
to the destructive interference in the absorption path.
In exact numerical calculations, a slight L-dependence of
(±)
φ
cc occurs at low energy [34]. This smooths the variation
of the time delay around 75○ and 105○, leading to a phase
jump smaller than π as shown in Fig. 3. (A π phase jump
corresponds to a delay of 667 as.) As the kinetic energy
increases, the angles at which the destructive interference
occur move towards 90○ since the asymmetry between
absorption and emission becomes weaker and the phase
jump closer to π (see SM).

We now study the case of Ar, for which we present both
experimental measurements and theoretical calculations
of the asymmetry parameter β2 as a function of the delay
as well as angle-resolved photoionization time delay mea-
surements. This case is more complex than He since there
are three incoherent channels corresponding to m = 0, ±1
and since for m = 0, there are two possible intermediate
angular momenta (λ = 0, 2). In the experiments, we focus
a XUV attosecond pulse train with photon energy in the
20-40 eV range, together with a fraction of the fundamen-
tal IR ﬁeld (̵hω = 1.58 eV) with a variable delay, into a
gas jet of argon atoms. The photoelectrons are detected
using a Velocity Map Imaging Spectrometer (see [22, 36]
for more details on the experimental setup). Because of
the proximity of the 3s−1np series of window resonances,
SB 16 and 18 are excluded from our analysis. Fig. 4
(a) and (b) shows that the asymmetry parameter β2 re-
trieved from the RABBIT measurements or simulations

the attosecond pulse trains are intrinsically chirped. This
chirp, corresponding to a group delay dispersion of 0.018

theory easier, the chirp is removed in Fig. 4(a). Theory
and experiment show good qualitative agreement, with
a β2 delay dependence decreasing with energy. The dif-
ference at the minima of the oscillations might originate
from a low signal to noise ratio close to 90○, non uniform
macroscopic phase eﬀects in the gas target and limited
angular resolution.

The angle-resolved atomic delays extracted from the
analysis of the experimental RABBIT traces are shown
in Fig. 4(c). For each data point, the SB signal was inte-
grated over 10○ and the oscillations were ﬁtted according
to Eq. (2). These results are compared to our simula-
tions and show excellent agreement, demonstrating the
accuracy of both experimental and theoretical methods
employed.
In both cases, for each SB, the phase mea-
sured at the lowest angle was set to zero to make the
comparison easier.

In conclusion, we have generalized Fano’s propensity
rule to laser-assisted photoionization. The asymmetry
between absorption and emission has strong implications
on angle-resolved RABBIT measurements since it leads
to incomplete quantum interference. This provides a gen-
eral explanation to both the delay dependence of the
PADs [22] and the angular dependence of the photoion-
ization time delays [21]. These conclusions are valid
even in the case of multiple incoherent angular chan-
nels as shown by the excellent agreement between our
calculations and our experimental measurements in Ar.

conclusions can be extended to more complex atomic
or molecular systems. The understanding of angular-
resolved laser-assisted photoionization is essential to the
study of angle-resolved attosecond dynamics in a variety
of systems.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

In the main text, we argue that the angle-dependence
of the photoionization time delays can be understood
with Fano’s propensity rule. Here, we explain in more
details how the asymmetry between absorption and emis-
sion leads to an angle-dependence of the atomic delays.

terference between the two ﬁnal states. Fig. 5 shows that
Y20(θ) crosses Λ(+) at two angles 75○ and 105○, while Λ(−)
never crosses Y20. As a consequence, the angle-dependent
time delay presents a sharp variation close to the position
of the destructive interference in the absorption path as
seen in Fig. 3 in the main text. As the energy of the pho-
toelectron increases, the asymmetry between absorption
and emission is reduced and Λ(+) and Λ(−) get closer.

leading to an angle-independent sideband phase. The
angular dependence of photoionization time delays can
hence be attributed to the asymmetry between absorp-
tion and emission, which comes from the generalized
Fano’s propensity rule.
