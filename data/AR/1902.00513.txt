On the dynamics of a charged particle in
magnetic ﬁelds with cylindrical symmetry

Paolo Caldiroli∗, Gabriele Cora†

Abstract

We study the motion of a charged particle under the action of a magnetic ﬁeld with cylindrical
symmetry. In particular we consider magnetic ﬁelds with constant direction and with magnitude
depending on the distance r from the symmetry axis of the form 1 + Ar−γ as r → ∞, with A 6= 0
and γ > 1. With perturbative-variational techniques, we can prove the existence of inﬁnitely many
trajectories whose projection on a plane orthogonal to the direction of the ﬁeld describe bounded
curves given by the superposition of two motions: a rotation with constant angular speed at a unit
distance about a point which moves along a circumference of large radius ρ with a slow angular
speed ε. The values ρ and ε are suitably related to each other. This problem has some interest
also in the context of planar curves with prescribed curvature.

Keywords: Newton-Lorentz equation, magnetic ﬁeld, motion of charged particles, curves in Eu-
clidean space, prescribed curvature.

Introduction and statement of the result

This paper concerns the dynamics of a particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. This subject is quite important in
several areas of physics, such as condensed matter theory [8], accelerator physics [13], magnetobiology
[10] and plasma physics [17]. However, despite the relevance and the variety of contexts, it seems that
for this problem, in concrete magnetic ﬁelds, only few rigorous results are available in the literature
(see [1, 2, 4, 12, 18]).

From classical physics, in presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld B, the motion t 7→ q(t) ∈ R3 of a

particle of mass m and charge e is driven by the Lorentz force, according to the equation

m¨q = e ˙q ∧ B.

(1.1)

When B is a constant ﬁeld, namely B = Bν for some versor ν and B positive constant, the system is
integrable and trajectories are helices with axis a line of the ﬁeld and Larmor ray given by rL = mv⊥
|e|B ,
where v⊥ is the speed orthogonal to the ﬁeld direction. More precisely, the projection q⊥(t) of q(t) on
a plane orthogonal to ν moves on a circle of radius rL with constant angular speed |e|B/m.

The situation can drastically change if one considers a variable magnetic ﬁeld, even in the case of
constant direction and magnitude close to a constant. In this work we consider a class of magnetic
ﬁelds with cylindrical symmetry, namely we assume that B has a constant direction, which can be

taken as the third axis, and the magnitude of B depends just on the distance from the third axis. This
means that

B(q1, q2, q3) = (0, 0, B(q1, q2)) ∀(q1, q2, q3) ∈ R3

(1.2)

with B depending just on

1 + q2
q2

2. For B of the form (1.2), problem (1.1) reduces to the system

p




m B(q1, q2) ˙q2

m B(q1, q2) ˙q1

¨q1 = e
¨q2 = − e
¨q3 = 0 .

(1.3)

In this case, again the component of q(t) in the direction of B, i.e. q3(t), describes a uniform motion,
but the projection of q(t) on the horizontal plane follows a trajectory which in general can be far from
being circular or closed or also globally bounded, even when B is close to a constant.



Considering that the study of the dynamics of a single charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld con-
stitutes a ﬁrst elementary model for the motion of plasma, the search for trapped trajectories (in the
directions orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld) seems properly motivated. For this reason we are inter-
ested in motions q(t) whose projection on the horizontal plane, given by t 7→ (q1(t), q2(t)) =: ˜q(t) ∈ R2,
draws a globally bounded, possibly closed, planar curve. We will say that such motions are bounded.
When the projection ˜q(t) deﬁnes a closed curve, we will say that the corresponding motion is periodic.
With respect to this goal, we can reduce ourselves to study the planar system deﬁned by the ﬁrst

two equations of (1.3). Setting v(t) = ˜q(−mt/e), the planar system for ˜q(t) becomes

v : R → R2
¨v = iB(v) ˙v

(cid:26)

(1.4)

where we identify R2 with the complex plane; the multiplication by the imaginary unit yields a
counter-clockwise rotation of π/2.

Actually, we can change the system in (1.4) into an equivalent scalar problem of geometrical
type, concerning curves with prescribed mean curvature. To this aim, recall that for a regular curve
u : R → R2 of class C2, the curvature at u(t) is given by

K(u(t)) =

i ˙u(t) · ¨u(t)
| ˙u(t)|3

.

(1.5)

If v solves (1.4) then | ˙v| is constant (this can be obtained just multiplying the equation by ˙v, that
implies d
dt | ˙v|2 = 0). In particular, if a solution v of (1.4) veriﬁes also | ˙v| ≡ 1, then B(v) equals the
curvature of the curve parametrized by v. On the other hand, if u : R → R2 is a bounded solution to

i ˙u · ¨u
| ˙u|3 = B(u)

(1.6)

then one can ﬁnd an increasing diﬀeomorphism g of R onto R such that u ◦ g solves (1.4) (see Lemma
2.4). In this way, for a vector ﬁeld B with cylindrical symmetry, i.e., of the form (1.2), we can covert
the problem of bounded trajectories of (1.1) into the geometrical problem about bounded curves with
prescribed curvature B = |B|.

There are many contributions to the issue of planar K-loops, i.e., closed curves in the Euclidean
plane, with prescribed curvature K (see [3, 4, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16]). Among them, we mention a couple
of results more linked to our work: in [11] it is proved that if the prescribed curvature function K is
strictly monotone in a given direction, with non zero derivative, then no (immersed) K-loop exists.
In [14] it is shown that if the prescribed curvature function K is positive, radially symmetric and is
non-increasing as a function of the distance from the radial symmetry point, then any simple K-loop
is in fact a circle.

In this work are interested in bounded, non round, possibly periodic motions with “high energy”
for a class of mappings B : R2 → R which are radially symmetric (with respect to u ∈ R2) and with a
behavior at inﬁnity of the form

B(u) ∼ 1 +

A
|u|γ

as |u| → ∞ ,

u ∈ R2 ,

(1.7)

with γ > 0 and A ∈ R \ {0}. Moreover, we consider a special class of curves, deﬁned (in complex
notation) as

vε,ρ(t) = ρeiεt + eit

with ρ ≫ 1 and 0 < |ε| ≪ 1. Such curves are obtained as a superposition of two motions: a counter-
clockwise rotation with constant angular speed at a unit distance about a point which moves along a
circumference of large radius ρ with a slow angular speed ε (see Fig. 1). The slow rotation is counter-
clockwise if ε > 0, or clockwise if ε < 0. Observe that ρ − 1 ≤ |vε,ρ(t)| ≤ ρ + 1 for every t ∈ R, and
that the (support of the) curve parametrized by vε,ρ does not change after rotations of angles 2πε

Fig. 1 – Curves parametrized by vε,ρ for diﬀerent values of ε. If ε = m
n with m, n ∈ N, m < n, then
vε,ρ is periodic of period 2nπ and, for ρ large enough, parametrizes a closed curve with (n − m)
curls and has a rotational symmetry of an angle 2π/(n − m). If ε 6∈ Q then the range of vε,ρ ﬁlls
densely the annulus of radii ρ − 1 and ρ + 1.

Considering curves vε,ρ is motivated by the observation that we look for solutions to (1.6) living
far away, where B is close to the constant value 1, in view of (1.7). Hence we expect to ﬁnd solutions
made by almost uniform circular motions of unit radius. Moreover, since we are interested in bounded
trajectories and we deal with a planar problem characterized by radial symmetry, it seems reasonable
to look for solutions of (1.6) as perturbations of vε,ρ in the normal direction, i.e., of the form

u = vε,ρ + φNε,ρ where Nε,ρ :=

i ˙vε,ρ
| ˙vε,ρ|

and φ is a scalar mapping. The discrete symmetry with respect to rotations of angles 2πε
preserved asking φ to be periodic of period 2π

Theorem 1.1 Let B ∈ C1(R2; R) be a radial function satisfying:

(B1) B(u) = 1 + A|u|−γ + A1|u|−γ1 + o(|u|−γ−1) as |u| → ∞, with A, A1 ∈ R, A 6= 0, and 1 < γ < γ1;

If A > 0 then there exist positive constants ε, µ, a1, a2 such that for every ε ∈ (0, ε) there are ρε > 0
and a solution uε of (1.4) such that:

If A < 0, then the same conclusion holds true with ε ∈ (−ε, 0). Moreover, in both cases, the curve
parametrized by uε is invariant with respect to rotations of angles 2πε
1−ε and is closed if ε is
rational.

1−ε and 2π

The assumption γ > 1 as well as the conditions (B1) and (B2) precise the behavior of B at inﬁnity.
As by-product of Theorem 1.1, we remark that in general the uniqueness result proved in [14] and
previously quoted is true just for simple loops.

Going back to the problem of trajectories of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld with cylindrical

symmetry, as a consequence of Theorem 1.1, we obtain:

Corollary 1.2 Let B : R3 → R3 be a vector ﬁeld of the form (1.2) with B ∈ C1(R2; R) radial function
satisfying (B1) and (B2). Then there exists a family of motions for the Lorentz equation (1.1) whose
projections on the horizontal plane, up to reparameterization in time, correspond to the solutions uε
given by Theorem 1.1.

The proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, combined with a

certain variational argument. Firstly, in order to get rid of the parameter ε, we deﬁne

uε,ρ(t) := vε,ρ (cid:18)

t
1 − ε (cid:19)

and nε,ρ(t) := Nε,ρ (cid:18)

t
1 − ε (cid:19)

and we look for solutions to (1.6) in the form

u = uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ

(1.9)

(1.10)

with ϕ periodic of period 2π. Plugging (1.10) into (1.6) yields the following nonlinear problem for ϕ:

ϕ : R → R , 2π-periodic
Kε,ρ(ϕ) = B(uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ)

(cid:26)

(1.11)

where Kε,ρ is the second order diﬀerential operator deﬁned by

Kε,ρ(ϕ) :=

dt (uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ) · d2
i d

.

(1.12)

dt (uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Then, we identify the operator obtained by linearizing problem (1.11), in the limit ε → 0. The resulting
operator, acting among spaces of periodic mappings, turns out to have a two-dimensional kernel. After
detaching its kernel, we can invert it and convert problem (1.11) into a ﬁxed point problem, where
the contraction principle can be applied. Actually, because of the two-dimensional kernel, we arrive
to solve (1.11) for |ε| small enough and for every ρ suﬃciently large in a suitable interval of values
depending on ε, apart from a couple of Lagrange multipliers. This is performed in Section 3.

In order to remove the Lagrange multipliers, we exploit the variational nature of problem (1.11).
In fact, (1.11) corresponds ultimately to the Euler-Lagrange equation of a suitable energy functional.
One of the Lagrange multipliers can be eliminated by taking variations with respect to the parameter
ρ. This leads to an equation for ρ with respect to ε, which can be solved in correspondence of some

4

ρε taking ε > 0 if A > 0 or ε < 0 if A < 0, as in the statement of Theorem 1.1. The other Lagrange
multiplier comes from the rotational invariance and it disappears for free as soon as the ﬁrst one
vanishes. This part of the proof is accomplished in Section 4.

From the technical point of view, the argument used in the proof of Theorem 1.1 shares some
features with other works. In particular, we mention a higher dimensional version of the problem,
about surfaces in R3 with prescribed mean curvature, shaped on collars of spheres arranged along a
circumference with large radius, in order to construct a surface with genus 1. This kind of problem has
been recently studied in [5, 6] for a class of mean curvature functions with a behavior at inﬁnity like
(1.7) but in the Euclidean 3-space. We also quote the paper [19], where somehow similar techniques
were already implemented to ﬁnd multiple solutions to the nonlinear Schr¨oedinger equation with a
radially symmetric potential again with a behavior like (1.7).

2 The curvature operator

As described in the Introduction, the problem is redirected to the search of solutions to (1.6) in
the form u = uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ where uε,ρ(t) = ρeiεt/(1−ε) + eit/(1−ε), nε,ρ(t) = i ˙uε,ρ(t)/| ˙uε,ρ(t)| and the
unknown is the function ϕ : R → R which is asked to be 2π-periodic. Hence the problem for u, in
turn, is converted into the following nonlinear equation for ϕ:

Kε,ρ(ϕ) = B(uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ)

(2.1)

where Kε,ρ is the second order diﬀerential operator deﬁned by (1.12) and B : R2 → R is a radially
symmetric C1 function satisfying (B1) and (B2). Notice that if u = uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ and ϕ is 2π-periodic,
then by (1.8) and (1.9)

u(t + 2π) = e

2πi
1−ε u(t) = e

2πiε
1−ε u(t) .

(2.2)

In this Section we study the operator Kε,ρ, considered from the space of 2π-periodic functions of
class C2, denoted C2(R/2πZ), into the space of 2π-periodic continuous functions, denoted C0(R/2πZ).
Such spaces are Banach spaces endowed with their natural norms. In fact Kε,ρ turns out to be deﬁned
in

N := {ϕ ∈ C2(R/2πZ) | | ˙uε,ρ + ϕ ˙nε,ρ + ˙ϕnε,ρ| > 0 on R} .

(2.3)

Lemma 2.1 The operator Kε,ρ is of class C∞ from N into C0(R/2πZ). In particular

Proof. The operators ϕ 7→ i d
from C2(R/2πZ) into C0(R/2πZ, R3). Hence they are of class C∞. As the mapping (v, w) 7→ v·w
class C∞ in (R2 \ {0}) × R2, the regularity of Kε,ρ as well as the expression of K′
diﬀerential calculus in Banach spaces.

The diﬀerential operator L0 : C2(R/2πZ) → C0(R/2πZ) deﬁned as

L0ϕ := ¨ϕ + ϕ

(2.6)

will play a key role in the argument, because of the following fact.

Lemma 2.2 Fixing 0 < a1 ≤ a2 and δ ∈ (0, 1), one has that K′
ε,ρ(0) → L0 as ε → 0, uniformly with
respect to ρ ∈ Sε := [a1|ε|−δ, a2|ε|−δ], in the space of bounded linear operators from C2(R/2πZ) in
C0(R/2πZ). More precisely, for |ε| 6= 0 small enough, and for every ρ ∈ Sε one has

k(K′

ε,ρ(0) − L0)ϕkC 0 ≤ C|ε|ρkϕkC 2 ∀ϕ ∈ C2(R/2πZ)

where C depends only on a1, a2, and δ.

(cid:3)

Thanks to Lemma 2.2, the operator L0 deﬁned by (2.6) will constitute the leading term of the

curvature operator, in the limit ε → 0. It is well known that

ker(L0) = {ϕ ∈ C2(R/2πZ) | L0ϕ = 0} = span{cos t, sin t} .

Moreover, for an arbitrary continuous bounded function f : R → R, the equation L0ϕ = f admits a
two-parameter family of global solutions, which turn out to be periodic if and only if

2π

Z
0

f (t) cos t dt =

2π

Z

f (t) sin t dt = 0 .

(2.12)

Justiﬁed by that, we introduce the decomposition

C2(R/2πZ) = span{cos t, sin t} + X ⊥ where X ⊥ :=
C0(R/2πZ) = span{cos t, sin t} + Y ⊥ where Y ⊥ :=

f ∈ C2(R/2πZ) | (2.12) holds
(cid:8)
f ∈ C0(R/2πZ) | (2.12) holds
(cid:9)

(cid:8)

(cid:9)
.

,

Hence the operator L0 is a bijection from X ⊥ onto Y ⊥, it is linear and continuous and, by well known
facts, also L−1

0 : Y ⊥ → X ⊥ is so. Therefore there exists a constant C0 > 0 such that

kϕkC 2 ≤ C0kf kC 0 ∀f ∈ Y ⊥

(2.13)

where ϕ is the unique solution of L0ϕ = f in X ⊥.

In the remaining part of the work we aim to prove the following result.

Theorem 2.3 Let B ∈ C1(R2; R) be a radial function satisfying (B1) and (B2). There exist positive
constants ε, a1, a2, µ0 such that if A > 0, then for any ε ∈ (0, ε) there exist ρε ∈
and ϕε ∈ C2(R/2πZ) solving (2.1) and such that kϕεkC 2 ≤ µ0|ε|

Noting that, by (2.8) and (2.11), sup0<|ε|<ε knε,ρεkC 2 < ∞, Theorem 1.1 is an immediate conse-

quence of Theorem 2.3, whereas Corollary 1.2 easily follows, by the next elementary result:

Lemma 2.4 If u : R → R2 is a classical solution of (1.6), then there exists an increasing diﬀeomor-
phism g of R onto R such that u ◦ g solves (1.4).

Proof. Let u(t) be a solution to (1.6). The arc length ℓ(t) =
and denoting g(s) its inverse, the function v = u ◦ g satisﬁes

˙u(g(s)) · ¨u(g(s))
| ˙u(g(s))|4

˙u(g(s)) .

In particular |v′| ≡ 1 and v′′ · v′ = 0. Then v′′ is parallel to iv′ and, in view of (1.6), v solves (1.4). (cid:3)

3 The ﬁnite-dimensional reduction

In this Section we tackle equation (2.1) and we prove that it admits solutions for |ε| small enough and
non zero and for every ρ suﬃciently large, up to an extra term which is a linear combination of sin t
and cos t. More precisely, the following result holds true:

Let 0 < a1 ≤ a2 and δ ∈ (0, 1) be ﬁxed and let us introduce some notation. For every ε 6= 0 we

deﬁne

Sε :=

a1|ε|−δ, a2|ε|−δ

We will always take ρ ∈ Sε. Then, we ﬁx ε1 ∈

(3.4)

Hence for every ε ∈ [−ε1, ε1] \ {0} one has that Sε ⊂ (2, |ε|−1). In particular we recover the following
inequality, extensively used in the sequel: for ε ∈ [−ε1, ε1] \ {0} and ρ ∈ Sε, it holds

1 < C1|ε|−δ ≤ |uε,ρ(t)| ≤ C2|ε|−δ ∀t ∈ R ,

(3.5)

for some positive constants C1 and C2 depending only on a1, a2 and δ.

Let us introduce the operator Bε,ρ : C2(R/2πZ) → C0(R/2πZ) deﬁned by

Bε,ρ(ϕ) := B(uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ) .

The operator Bε,ρ is well deﬁned because B is radial and (2.2) holds. Moreover it inherits the same
regularity of B, i.e., it is of class C1. In particular

ε,ρ(ϕ)[ψ] = ψ∇B(uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ) · nε,ρ ∀ϕ, ψ ∈ C2(R/2πZ) .
B′

Finally, we deﬁne the operator Fε,ρ : N → C0(R/2πZ) by setting

Fε,ρ(ϕ) := Bε,ρ(ϕ) − Kε,ρ(ϕ) + L0ϕ .

(3.6)

(3.7)

In view of the regularity of Bε,ρ and by Lemma 2.1, Fε,ρ is of class C1 in N . Moreover

Fε,ρ(0) = B(uε,ρ) − K(uε,ρ) ,

F ′

ε,ρ(0)[ϕ] = ϕ∇B(uε,ρ) · nε,ρ − K′

ε,ρ(0)[ϕ] + L0ϕ ∀ϕ ∈ C2(R/2πZ)

with K deﬁned in (1.5).

The following estimates will be useful. From now on, with the symbol k · k without subscript we

will denote the norm in the space of bounded linear operators from C2(R/2πZ) into C0(R/2πZ).

Proof. We have that

b

kFε,ρ(0)kC 0 ≤ kB(uε,ρ) − 1kC 0 + kK(uε,ρ) − 1kC 0 .
Since, by (B1), B(v) = 1 + A|v|−γ + o(|v|−γ ) as |v| → ∞, using also (3.5), one can ﬁnd ε0 ∈ (0, ε1]
such that

(3.11)

(3.12)

where C is a constant depending only on a1, a2 and δ. Hence (3.10)–(3.12) imply (3.8), for some M0
depending on |A|, C1, and C. Let us show (3.9). We have that

and using (3.5) and the bound for ϕ ∈ Mε, we deduce that

k∇B(uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ)kC 0 ≤

C
(C1|ε|−δ − µ0|ε|bγ)min{γ+1,γ1} .

This estimate together with (3.14) yields

(cid:3)
consequence of (3.16) and (3.17), for a possibly smaller ε0.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. By (3.7), (2.1) is equivalent to

We aim to rewrite (3.23) as a ﬁxed point problem in C2(R/2πZ). Since range(L0) = Y ⊥, we consider
the projection of Fε,ρ(ϕ) on Y ⊥, given by

L0ϕ = Fε,ρ(ϕ) .

ϕ = Qε,ρ(ϕ)
(3.25)
then it satisﬁes L0ϕ = ˆFε,ρ(ϕ) and thus (3.1). We can solve (3.25) in a suitable neighborhood Nε of 0
in Y ⊥, whose size is determined by the estimate of the “error” Fε(0) according to Lemma 3.2. More
precisely, we set

thanks to (3.9). Hence, (3.27) and (3.28) imply that Qε,ρ is a contraction in Nε. Moreover, if ϕ ∈ Nε
then, by (3.8) and (3.28), and recalling that µ0 = 8C0M0,

kFε,ρ(ϕ)kC 0 ≤ kFε,ρ(0)kC 0 + kFε,ρ(ϕ) − Fε,ρ(0)kC 0 ≤ M0|ε|

contraction principle are satisﬁed and we can conclude that Qε,ρ admits a ﬁxed point in Nε.

4 The variational argument

In this Section we complete the proof of Theorem 2.3. The starting point is the result stated in
Theorem 3.1, according to which for every |ε| 6= 0 small enough and for every ρ ∈ [a1|ε|−δ, a2|ε|−δ]
there exists ϕε,ρ ∈ C2(R/2πZ) with kϕε,ρkC 2 ≤ µ0|ε|min{γδ,1−δ} satisfying

Kε,ρ(ϕε,ρ) − B(uε,ρ + ϕε,ρnε,ρ) = λ1

ε,ρ cos t + λ2

ε,ρ sin t

where the Lagrange multipliers λi
ε,ρ(ϕε,ρ) are given by (3.2). Up to now, a1, a2, δ ∈ R are
arbitrary ﬁxed constants with 0 < a1 ≤ a2 and δ ∈ (0, 1), and µ0 is a constant depending on a1, a2
and δ but not on ε neither on ρ.

ε,ρ = λi

Here we prove that for a suitable choice of a1, a2, δ ∈ R with 0 < a1 < a2 and δ ∈ (0, 1), for every
ε 6= 0 small enough and with a suitable sign (the same of the coeﬃcient A in the assumption (B1))
ε,ρ = λ2
one can ﬁnd ρε ∈ [a1|ε|−δ, a2|ε|−δ] such that λ1
ε,ρ = 0 when ρ = ρε. To this aim, we exploit
the variational nature of equation (1.6) which in fact corresponds to the Euler-Lagrange equation
associated to a certain energy functional.

The present Section consists in three parts: ﬁrstly we introduce the energy functional associated
to (1.6) and we discuss its properties useful for the sequel. Then we tackle the equation λ1
ε,ρ = 0 and
we prove that is admits a solution ρ = ρε under some conditions. Finally we show that as soon as
ε,ρ = 0, then also λ2
λ1

ε,ρ = 0.

4.1 The energy functional

Since B is radially symmetric of class C1, there exists a C1 map b : [0, ∞) → R such that B(v) = b(|v|)
for every v ∈ R2. Set

Q(v) =

|v|

v
|v|2 Z
0

b(s)s ds

(v ∈ R2 \ {0}) .

Then Q is a vector ﬁeld with a continuous extension on R2, of class C1 in R2 \ {0} and satisfying

div Q = B on R2
Q(eiθv) = eiθQ(v) ∀θ ∈ R , ∀v ∈ R2.

For every ε ∈ R, ε 6= 1, let

Notice that uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ ∈ Ωε, as ρ ∈ Sε, ϕ ∈ Nε and |ε| small enough. Set

E (u) :=

(| ˙u| + Q(u) · i ˙u) dt ∀u ∈ Ωε .

One has that:

Lemma 4.1 The functional E is of class C1 in Ωε and

and A (u) :=

Let us study the regularity of the functional A . Fix u ∈ Ωε and h ∈ W 1,1
. For ǫ 6= 0 small enough
one has that u + ǫh ∈ Ωε and there exists r0 > 0 such that |u(t) + ǫh(t)| > r0 > 0 for all t ∈ R. One

Since Q ∈ C1(R2 \ {0}, R2) and, in particular, Q and DQ are locally uniformly continuous in R2 \ {0},
by standard arguments, using also the embedding of W 1,1(0, 2π) into C([0, 2π]), one can prove that

lim

Q(u + ǫh) − Q(u)

lim

Observe that for ρ ∈ Sε one has that |ε|ργ+2 ≤ aγ+2
must have the same sign as A. Considering the case A > 0 and deﬁning Gε(ρ) := 2 − Aγ
we have that

Since α± are independent of ε and (4.8) holds, there exists ε ∈ (0, ε0] such that

Gε(a1|ε|−δ) − F (ε, a1|ε|−δ) < 0 < Gε(a2|ε|−δ) − F (ε, a2|ε|−δ) ∀ε ∈ (0, ε) .

(4.9)

Since the mapping ρ 7→ Gε(ρ) − F (ε, ρ) is continuous on Sε, by (4.9), it must vanish at some ρε ∈ Sε,
for every ε ∈ (0, ε), namely (4.7), and thus also (4.3) are satisﬁed when ρ = ρε. If A < 0 one can
repeat the same argument, taking ε ∈ (−ε, 0). Thus the lemma is proved. It remains to check (4.4)
and (4.5).

Proof of (4.4). Setting

Rε,ρ(ϕ) := Kε,ρ(ϕ) − Kε,ρ(0) − K′

Therefore we can write

In order to estimate the third integral on the right-hand side of (4.11), we observe that, ﬁxing ϕ and

Lemma 4.3 If u = uε,ρ + ϕnε,ρ solves K(u) − B(u) = λ sin t, with K deﬁned in (1.5), and ϕ ∈ Nε,
