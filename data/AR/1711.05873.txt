Abstract

We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of BiFeO3 (BFO) thin ﬁlms
grown over (100)-oriented Si substrates by rf magnetron sputtering in a new route un-
der O2 free low pressure Ar atmosphere. Single-phase BFO ﬁlms were deposited in a
heated substrate and post-annealed in situ. The new routed allows high deposition rate
and produce polycrystalline BFO pure phase, conﬁrmed by high resolution X-ray diﬀrac-
tion. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy reveal very low surface roughness
and mean particle size of 33 nm. The BFO phase and composition were conﬁrmed by
transmission electron microscopy and line scanning energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
in transmission electron microscopy mode. The surface chemistry of the thin ﬁlm, analyzed
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reveals the presence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in a 2:1 ratio,
a strong indication that the ﬁlm contains oxygen vacancies. An hysteretic ferromagnetic
behavior with room temperature high saturation magnetization ∼ 165 × 103 A/m was
measured along the ﬁlm perpendicular and parallel directions. Such high magnetization,
deriving from this new route, is explained in the scope of oxygen vacancies, the break of
the antiferromagnetic cycloidal order and the increase of spin canting by change in the
surface/volume ratio. Understanding the magnetic behavior of a multiferroic thin ﬁlms is a
key for the development of heterogeneous layered structures and multilayered devices and
the production of multiferroic materials over Si substrates opens new possibilities in the
development of materials that can be directly integrated into the existent semiconductor
and spintronic technologies.

1. Introduction

Multiferroic materials combines at less
two ferroics properties, either coupled or
not, being those most interesting the ones
that combine magnetic order with electric
order. The control of magnetic properties
in non multiferroic materials is usually a
high energy consumption process involving
applied magnetic ﬁelds. One the other hand,

magnetic control by means of electric ﬁelds
in multiferroics consumes less energy[1, 2, 3]
and opens new possibilities in the develop-
ment of materials that can be directly inte-
grated into the existent semiconductor and
spintronic technologies[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The BiFeO3 (BFO) compound is one
of the most studied multiferroics material,
either in bulk, nanoparticles or in thin
ﬁlms[6]. BFO bulk materials have a g-type
antiferromagnetic structure with a cycloid
spin structure period of approximately 62
nm along (110) direction[7][8]. The syn-

thesis process of pure BFO is usually dif-
ﬁcult due the bismuth volatility and the ap-
pearance of spurious phases like Bi2Fe4O9,
Bi25FeO39, Bi2O3 and Fe2O3. Thin ﬁlm fab-
rication of pure BFO by pulsed laser de-
position (PLD) or by rf magnetron sput-
tering normally involves the use of an oxy-
gen rich atmosphere[9] to reduce the for-
mation of oxygen vacancies that are re-
ported to degrade some important ferroelec-
tric properties[10]. Nevertheless this may
also increase the presence of the undesirable
spurious phases[9]. In this work, high mag-
netic pure polycrystalline BFO thin ﬁlms
were grown over (100)-oriented Si substrates
using a new route, with rf magnetron sput-
tering using a O2 free atmosphere. The sur-
face chemistry of the thin ﬁlm, analyzed by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reveals
the presence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in a 2:1 ra-
tio which, in the absence of spurious Fe ox-
ides like Fe3O4, is a strong indication that
the ﬁlm contains oxygen vacancies. An hys-
teretic ferromagnetic behavior with room
temperature high saturation magnetization
∼ 165 × 103 A/m is measured along the ﬁlm
perpendicular and parallel directions. Such
high magnetization is explained in the scope
of oxygen vacancies as well as the break
of the antiferromagnetic cycloidal order and
the increase of spin canting by change in the
surface/volume ratio due to the crystallite
size of the order of 30 nm. Understanding
the magnetic behavior of a multiferroic thin
ﬁlms is a key for the development of het-
erogeneous layered structures and multilay-
ered devices, e.g. multiferroic tunnel junc-
tions and for multiferroic exchange bias het-
erostructures, e.g.
in Magnetoelectric Ran-
dom Acess Memories (MERAMS). The pro-
duction of multiferroic materials over Si sub-
strates opens new possibilities in the devel-
opment of materials that can be directly
integrated into the existent semiconductor
and spintronic technologies.

2. Experimental

2.1 New sputtering route

BFO thin ﬁlms were grown directly over
(100)-oriented Si substrates by rf magnetron
sputtering, with a base pressure of 1.3×10−6
Pa (10−8 Torr), using a BFO commercial
target (AJA International, Inc.). All sub-
strates were previously cleaned with hy-
droﬂuoric acid in order to remove the ther-
mal SiO2 layer and induce an hydrophobic
surface. Deposition of the BFO ﬁlm was
made using 35 W of rf power at a pure Ar
atmosphere working pressure of 4×10−1 Pa
(3×10−3 Torr). Usually BFO is deposited
under O2 atmosphere [11, 12]. In this new
route, the atmosphere is O2 free. The sub-
strate temperature was maintained at 873 K
during deposition in order to produce an ho-
mogeneous ﬁlm. A further in situ annealing
was made at 973 K for 3600 s, at the base
pressure, to induce pure BFO phase forma-
tion [13].

2.2 Graze incident high resolution X-ray
diﬀraction

The BFO phase and grain size were char-
acterized by graze incident high resolution
X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) at the LNLS syn-
chrotron in Campinas, SP, Brazil, with 9
keV energy, as shown in Figure 1.

The XRD diﬀractogram shows a R3cH
polycrystalline BiFeO3 pure phase, indexed
with JCD188396 card, without any traces
of the common spurious phases Bi25FeO39,
Bi2Fe4O9 and iron oxides [14, 15]. No signif-
icant amorphous phase signature can be de-
tected in the diﬀractogram as expected con-
sidering the Fe-O and Bi2O3-Fe2O3 phase
diagrams [13, 16, 17]

The estimated particle size was calculated
from Debye-Scherrer equation, considering
the peaks overlap and the instrumental con-
tributions, giving a mean size of ∼ 30 ± 8
nm (Table 1).

2.3 Surface morphology

Surface morphology and grain size were
also studied by atomic force microscopy

(AFM - Brucker Nonoscope V - Lab-
Surf/CBPF), measured in tapping mode,
and by ﬁeld emission gun scanning electron
microscopy (FEG SEM - Raith eLine - LAB-
NANO/CBPF). Atomic force microscopy,
shown in Figure 2, conﬁrms a low surface
roughness average (Ra) around ∼ 4 ± 1 nm.

Figure 3 shows a SEM image of the BFO
ﬁlm conﬁrming a high homogeneous ﬁlm
surface. Figure 3 inset shows the grain size
distribution with a mean size ∼ 33 ± 7 nm.
The grain size calculated by Debye-Scherrer
equation is close to the one found by SEM
images as can be seen in Table 1. Both grain
size values are smaller than the antiferro-
magnetic cycloid ordering (∼ 60 nm) in bulk
BFO. It is well known that the breaking of
the antiferromagnetic cycloid ordering gives
rise to a small ferromagnetic contribution to
BFO magnetic behavior [7].

2.4 Transmission electron microscopy

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM -
Jeol JEM 2100-F - LABNANO/CBPF) was
employed to verify the BFO ﬁlm thickness,
ﬁlm/substrate interface quality and compo-
sition. The TEM sample was prepared by
focus ion beam (FIB - Tescan Lyra 3 - LAB-
NANO/CBPF), with gallium ion milling,
initially with a accelerating voltage of 30 kV
and a beam current of 4.97 nA. Eventually
those values were changed in few polishing
stages (30 kV - 1.2 nA, 30 kV - 0.2 nA, 10 kV
- 0.145 nA and 5 kV - 0.02 nA). To reduce
Ga implantation during the FIB milling pro-
cess, thin carbon followed by a thin Pt layers
were deposited over the BFO ﬁlm before the
milling. Figure 4a shows the bright ﬁeld im-
age of the BFO ﬁlm cross section where the
Si, BFO and Pt rich regions are indicated.
As can be observed, the ﬁlm/substrate in-
terface is very smooth presenting a good ad-
hesion. The BFO ﬁlm has a total thickness
around 89 nm, as also conﬁrmed by electron
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line scan in
scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) mode of the BFO thin ﬁlm cross
section. One can observe that up to 23.3
nm from the surface the BFO ﬁlm presents

low crystallinity caused by the milling pro-
cess. This eﬀect is well known and widely
reported in the literature[18, 19]. Figure 4b
presents the EDS line scan in STEM mode
showing clearly the substrate/ﬁlm transi-
tion, the ∼ 89 nm sputtered ﬁlm composed
by Bi,Fe and O, and the ﬁlm surface transi-
tion to the Pt rich region. Carbon was found
along the whole scan as expected. The dark
ﬁeld image of the same selected area is pre-
sented in Figure 4c where the bright zones
are BFO crystals diﬀracting. One can see
also some bright spots at the Pt rich re-
gion. This bright BFO region corresponds
to the (-102) diﬀraction spot on Figure 4d
where the selected area electron diﬀraction
(SAED) is presented. The SAED, obtained
in the BFO zone axis [-2 8 -1], shows the
BFO spots together with Si and amorphous

Pt. High resolution TEM image of one
BFO crystallite is observed in Figure 4e.
Atomic planes with inter-planar distances of
∼ 3.78 nm where indexed as corresponding
to the (102) plane. A Fast Fourier Trans-
form (FFT) of the BFO crystallite in the
zone axis [-2 8 -1] in Figure 4e, shown in
Figure 4f, matches the SAED pattern, with
the brighter spots corresponding to the 102
planes.

2.5 X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy

X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements were made using a SPECS
PHOIBOS 100/150 spectrometer with a
polychromatic Al Kα 1486.6 eV radiation
and a 150 mm hemispherical analyzer, in
order to study the Fe and Bi chemical state
at the thin ﬁlm surface. The emitted pho-

toelectrons were detected using a 0.05 eV
energy step for high resolution spectras and
0.5 eV for the survey spectrum. The bind-
ing energy scale of the XPS spectra was cal-
ibrated using the C 1s (284.6 eV). From
the XPS survey spectra (Figure 5a) the cal-
culated Bi:Fe ratio, considering Fe 2p and
Bi 4p3/2 peaks due to a close binding ener-
gies and similar intensities, is ∼ 1, compat-
ible with the BFO stoichiometry. Figures
5b,c and d exhibit the high resolution spec-
tra of O 1s, Bi 4f and Fe 2p respectively,
which were deconvoluted using CASA-XPS
software considering a Shirley background.
Figure 5b shows O 1s peak (529.16 eV) in-
dicating a binding energy present when an
O-Fe bond exists[20, 21] and a C-O bond
peak (531.15 eV), typical for surfaces with
any oxygen component. Figure 5c shows
two Bi 4f peaks with binding energies of

158.51 eV and 163.82 eV and separation of
5.31 eV, very close to previous reported val-
ues for Bi3+ oxidation state[22]. In Figure
5d, Fe 2p spectra exhibits the Fe 2p3/2, Fe
2p1/2 and their respective satellites peaks.
The separation between Fe 2p3/2 (710.39
eV) and Fe 2p1/2 (724.00 eV) is 13.61 eV
and the separation between Fe 2p3/2 peak
and its satellite is 8.08 eV. These results are
in accordance with previous reported values
for BiFeO3 where a Fe3+ predominance is
observed[22, 23]. The deconvolution of Fe
2p3/2 cannot be done with a simple gauss-
lorentzian ﬁtting because of its asymmetry.
A good ﬁt of the asymmetric Fe 2p3/2 peak
(Figure 5d) can be achieved only by tak-
ing into account a surface peak[24] at 712,6
eV, which is consider as Fe2+ satellite due
to the loss of the crystal ﬁeld at surface
[20, 25, 26, 27], in addition to the Fe2+ and

5

Fe3+ peaks at 709,20 eV [23, 26] and 710,31
eV [26], respectively.

4f and d) Fe 2p of the BFO thin ﬁlm grown in a O2
free low pressure Ar atmosphere .

Table 2 summarizes the deconvoluted
XPS data. The Fe contribution shows a
Fe3+:Fe2+ ratio of about 2:1 at the thin ﬁlm
surface. Although this ratio is the same
found in magnetite phase (Fe2+Fe3+
2 O4),
which is a possible magnetic spurious phase
in BiFeO3, this is not the case here, as con-
ﬁrmed by the hight resolution X-ray anal-
ysis. Therefore, we address the signiﬁcant
presence of Fe2+ as the presence of oxygen
vacancies that can be a result of the O2 free
low pressure Ar atmosphere used in our sam-
ple preparation.

2.6 Magnetic Properties

Magnetization was measured as a function
of applied magnetic ﬁeld, for diﬀerent tem-
peratures, using a Quantum Design MP3M
SQUID in VSM mode. The magnetic hys-
teresis curves (MH) were obtained with a
maximum applied magnetic ﬁeld of 7 T and
temperatures ranging from 2 to 300 K. Mea-
surements were performed with either an in-
plane or out-of-plane applied magnetic ﬁeld,
and the diamagnetic contribution from the
Si substrate was removed from the data. All
measurements were corrected for the resid-
ual remanent ﬁeld of the SQUID supercon-
ducting magnet using a paramagnetic Pd
standard sample, to avoid experimental ar-
tifacts.

Figure 6a shows the room temperature
magnetic hysteresis curves measured in-
plane and out-of plane.
As expected,
the out-of-plane curve present a shape
anisotropy contribution due to the demagne-
tizing ﬁeld. Both in-plane and out-of-plane
present room temperature high saturation
magnetization of ∼ 165 × 103 A/m, corre-
sponding to ∼ 1µB per unit cell. Wang et
al. found a saturation magnetization value
of 150 × 103 A/m for a 70 nm BFO thin ﬁlm
grown epitaxially on SrTiO3 [28]. A satura-
tion magnetization of 180 × 103A/m for a 40
nm thick was also reported by Laughlin et
al. on BFO thin ﬁlms grown on SrTiO3/Si
by MBE [29]. Those values are much higher
than the 28 A/m (38 nm thick) epitaxially
grown over LaAlO3 ﬁlm reported by Cheng
et al.
It is important to stress that
all those high magnetization reported val-
ues were obtained for epitaxially grown thin
ﬁlms, contrary to our polycrystalline sam-
ple. As can be seen in detail at Figure 6b,

[30].

a non-null in-plane magnetization at rema-
nence (∼ 20 × 103 A/m) and coercive ﬁeld
(∼ 86 × 10−4 T) was found even at room
temperature. The behavior of the in-plane
saturation magnetization and coercive ﬁeld
as function of temperature can be seen on
Figure 6c. Both behaviors does not change
signiﬁcantly with increasing temperature, as
also observed by Wang et al. [28].

plane magnetic hysteresis curves of pure BFO thin

netization (right axis) behavior as function of tem-

3. Discussion

In literature, one can ﬁnd many reports
about weak ferromagnetic behavior in pure
BFO nanostructured materials (nanoparti-
cles [31], nanowires [32], nanotubes [33] and
thin ﬁlms [28, 34, 30]). However, this topic
is still in debate and some authors attribute
this weak ferromagnetism to the presence of
spurious magnetic phases such as Bi25FeO39,
Bi2Fe4O9 and γ−Fe2O3 [14, 35, 9]. Based
on our characterizations, there are no spu-
rious magnetic phases on the rf sputtered
BFO over Si samples. Weak ferromagnetism
on pure BFO is commonly attributed either
to the suppression of the spin cycloidal or-
der, to the increase of the spin canting by
change in the surface/volume ratio or to
the presence of oxygen vacancies[29, 33, 32].
Although our ﬁlm is ∼ 89 nm thick, it is
clearly composed by crystallites of 30 nm
mean size, i.e. bellow the 62 nm long cy-
cloidal spin structure, giving rise to uncom-
pensated spins [31]. Besides that, the O2
free low Ar pressure atmosphere promotes
oxygen deﬁciency, leading to Fe2+ state and
could give rise to carrier-mediated local fer-
romagnetic order across Fe3+-O2−-Fe2+.

4. Summary

In summary, we have grown polycrys-
talline BFO thin ﬁlms by rf sputtering
in a O2 free low pressure Ar atmosphere
over (100)-oriented Si substrates. The pure
BFO is conﬁrmed by high resolution X-ray
diﬀraction which shows no trace of com-
monly observed spurious magnetic phases.
SEM and AFM reveals a very low rough-
ness surface (less than 4 nm) and mean par-
ticle size of 30 nm. The BFO phase and
composition were conﬁrmed by TEM and
XPS, the latter also conﬁrming the presence
of Fe2+. Hysteretic ferromagnetic behav-
ior with high saturation magnetization of
∼ 165 × 103 A/m and non-zero coercivity at
room temperature was measured along the
ﬁlm perpendicular and parallel directions.
Such high magnetization has been explained
in the scope of the suppression of the spin

cycloidal order, increase of the spin cant-
ing and the presence oxygen vacancies. The
fabrication of high magnetic pure BFO over
Si substrates is an important step towards
the integration of magnetic multiferroic ox-
ides with semiconductors. This is a key
for the development of heterogeneous lay-
ered structures and multilayer devices with
high impact on technological advancements,
e.g. magnetoelectric random access mem-
ories, and for multiferroic materials direct
integration into the existent semiconductor
and spintronic technologies.
