We explore the shape and internal structure of diblock copolymer (di-BCP) nanoparticles (NPs)
by using the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy expansion. The self-assembly of di-BCP lamellae conﬁned
in emulsion droplets can form either ellipsoidal or onion-like NPs. The corresponding inner structure
is a lamellar phase that is either perpendicular to the long axis of the ellipsoids (L⊥) or forms a
multi-layer concentric shell (C(cid:107)), respectively. We focus on the eﬀects of the interaction parameter
between the A/B monomers τ , and the polymer/solvent χ, as well as the NP size on the nanoparticle
shape and internal morphology. The aspect ratio (lAR) deﬁned as the length ratio between the long
and short axes is used to characterize the overall NP shape. Our results show that for the solvent
that is neutral towards the two blocks, as τ increases, the lAR of the NP ﬁrst increases and then
decreases, indicating that the NP becomes more elongated and then changes to a spherical NP.
Likewise, decreasing χ or increasing the NP size can result in a more elongated NP. However, when
the solvent has a preference towards the A or B blocks, the NP shape changes from striped ellipsoid
to onion-like sphere by increasing the A/B preference parameter strength. The critical condition of
the transition from an L⊥ to C(cid:107) phase has been identiﬁed. Our results are in good agreement with
previous experiments, and some of our predictions could be tested in future experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) with well-controlled in-
ternal structure have attracted a large amount of interest
due to their multiple applications.1–3 The self-assembly
of block copolymers (BCP) into droplets has been proven
to be a useful method to produce NPs with well-deﬁned
shapes and internal morphologies.4–6 Such NPs contain-
ing BCP (BCP-NPs) are used in a wide range of ap-
plications such as drug delivery, smart coatings, catal-
ysis and optical lenses .15–18 From a fundamental view-
point, the formation of BCP-NPs is related to the mini-
mization of the interfacial energy of soft particles during
the self-assembly process. Consequently, diverse parti-
cle shapes are formed under soft conﬁnement, including
onion-like spherical NPs,7,8 striped ellipsoidal NPs,9,10
conical shaped NPs,11,12 oblate NPs composed of cylin-
drical phases13,14 and more. Here, the soft conﬁnement
refers to that the interface between NP and surrounding
solvent is soft and can be easily deformed. We illustrate
in Figure 1 two of the most common shapes of BCP-NPs
that will be used throughout our paper: striped ellip-
soidal shape (a); and, an onion-like spherical shape (b).
One of the current experimental challenges is to
fabricate ellipsoidal BCP-NPs with precisely controlled
shapes characterized by the particle aspect-ratio (lAR)
and internal morphology. As our present study is re-
stricted in two dimensions (2D), the aspect ratio, lAR, is
deﬁned as the ratio between the long and short axes of
the ellipsoidal particle. Signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been de-
voted in the past to address this fabrication challenge.

Among experimental attempts to control the particle
shape, we mention the addition of surfactants, inclusion
of other solid-like NPs, and varying the solvent evapora-
tion rate.19–22

Kim and co-workers conducted a series of experiments
on BCP-NPs. They systematically investigated the fab-
rication of such NPs with various shapes and inner struc-
tures. They found that the NP size, BCP molecular
weight23 as well as the Flory-Huggins interaction param-
eter24 are three key parameters that control the shape
(lAR) of ellipsoidal BCP-NPs. Moreover, the addition of
surfactants, including length-controlled nanorod surfac-
tants25 or photoresponsive surfactants,26 can induce the
transition of striped ellipsoidal NPs to onion-like spher-
ical NPs, due to the variation of the interfacial energy
between BCP-NPs and solvent. On the theoretical side,
phenomenological free energies of BCP-NPs have been
proposed9,27,28 to explain these experimental ﬁndings. It
was shown that the NP shapes are determined by the
competition between (i) the interfacial energy between
the A/B di-BCP, (ii) the entropic penalty due to chain
stretching and bending, and (iii) the surface energy of
BCP-NPs with its surrounding medium (poor solvent).
In a separate study, Avalos et al.29 presented exper-
imental results of annealing BCP-NPs and developed a
theoretical model based on the Cahn-Hilliard model to
describe the morphological evolution of striped ellipsoids
into onion-like spheres (see Figure 1). Their numerical
results showed that the annealing process changes the
temperature dependence of the Flory-Huggins parame-
ter and the interface width, and eventually results in a
morphology change. Chi et al.30 studied the BCP self-
assembly in soft conﬁnement in poor solvent conditions
using the simulated annealing method. They predicted
diﬀerent shapes and internal structures of BCP-NPs as

function of the polymer-solvent interaction strength and
BCP monomer concentration in solution.

The formation of BCP-NPs is easily obtained in exper-
iments, but at present, there is a lack of rigorous theoret-
ical description. Hence, a systematic theoretical study of
the formation mechanism of BCP-NPs, and, in particu-
lar, the inﬂuence of these key experimental parameters
(mentioned above) on the NP shape, are still necessary.
The theoretical study will not only enhance our funda-
mental understanding of how these parameters determine
the ﬁnal shape of BCP-NPs, but may also aid in the de-
velopment of applications.

To address further this challenge, we employ a
Ginzburg-Landau free energy and study the self-assembly
of BCP-NPs embedded in a poor solvent. Particularly,
we focus on the eﬀect of the A/B block interaction pa-
rameter, the NP size, and the symmetric as well as asym-
metric interactions between the polymer blocks and the
solvent on the ﬁnal shape and inner structure of BCP-
NPs. We show that most of the experimental results
of lamellar-forming BCP-NPs can be captured by our
model. Furthermore, we present several predictions on
how experimental controllable parameters aﬀect the ﬁ-
nal shape of the BCP-NPs.

Hereafter, our model based on the Ginzburg-Landau
free energy is introduced in section II. In section III,
the calculated phase-diagram separating NPs of distinct
shapes is presented in terms of the interactions between
diﬀerent system components and the NP size. Finally,
section IV contains a comparison between existing ex-
periments and other models, followed, in section V, by
the some conclusions and future prospects.

fractions of the A, B blocks and solvent, respectively.

Two order parameters are introduced for convenience,

ρ = φA + φB,
φ = φA − φB

(1)

where ρ is the total BCP volume fraction, and φ is the
concentration diﬀerence between the A and B blocks.

In the grand-canonical ensemble,

II. MODEL

We study the equilibrium shape of di-block copolymer
NPs (BCP-NPs) embedded in a solution by using the
Ginzburg-Landau free energy.31,32 We model a mixture
of three components: the A and B components of di-
BCPs and the solvent. The incompressibility condition is
φA + φB + φS = 1, where φA, φB, and φS are the volume

In order to analysis the formation mechanism of BCP
ellipsoidal NPs, we focus on two separate energy terms
of the full Ginzburg-Landau free energy, eq (2). The ﬁrst
one is the polymer free energy FP, which includes both
enthalpy and entropy of the polymer chains,

We will show that the BCP-NP equilibrium shape is
mainly determined by the competition between these two
terms of the full free energy, eq (2).

We use the conjugate gradient (CG) method to mini-
mize the Ginzburg-Landau free energy, eq (2), in order to
obtain the equilibrium density distribution of each com-
ponent. The numerical calculations are performed in a
two-dimensional (2D) box (Lx × Ly) with a spatial grid
∆x = ∆y = 0.05.
In our simulations, all lengths are
expressed in units of the bulk natural periodicity of the
lamellar phase, L0 ≡ 2π/q0.

III. RESULTS

From experiments, it is known that the lamellar phase
of BCP solution can form either ellipsoidal or onion-like
NPs (Figure 1). The lamellar order is usually perpen-
dicular to the long axis for ellipsoidal NPs, while for
onion-like NPs they form concentric shell structures. The
BCP-NP ﬁnal shape is mainly determined by the A/B
monomer interaction parameter τ , the polymer/solvent
interaction parameter χ, the preference of the solvent to-
wards the two components νφρ, and the size of the NPs.
Therefore, we mainly focus on the eﬀects of these exper-
imental controllable parameters on the shape and inner
structure of the BCP-NPs.

A. Ellipsoidal Particles (L⊥)

When the solvent preference towards the A and B com-
ponents is neutral, νφρ = 0, ellipsoidal NPs are usually
formed.
In this subsection, we present a systematical
study of the eﬀect of the parameters τ , χ, and the NP
size on the ﬁnal shape of the BCP-NPs, where for el-
lipsoidal NPs, the aspect ratio lAR serves as the shape
parameter and is deﬁned as the length ratio between the
major and minor axes.

1. The eﬀect of τ and χ on the NP shape

We ﬁrst present the eﬀect of the interaction parameter
τ , between the A and B components, and the interac-
tion parameter χ between polymer and solvent, on the
equilibrated lAR of the BCP-NPs. Figure 2 shows the
phase diagram in terms of distinct values of the lAR in
the (χ, τ ) plane. For a given set of (χ, τ ), we calculate
the free energy as a function of lAR by varying lAR in the
interval [0.69, 2.25]. The equilibrium lAR value is always
associated with the free energy at its minimum.

As can be seen in the phase diagram of Figure 2, for
χ ≥ 7.0, lAR nearly does not change as long as τ < 2.4.

3

When τ ≥ 2.4, the NPs tends towards a spherical (circu-
lar in 2D) shape. This indicates that in the large χ region,
large enough values of τ can decrease lAR. For χ < 7.0,
the dependence of lAR on τ becomes non-monotonous.
In this χ region, for ﬁxed χ and by increasing τ , lAR ﬁrst
increases and then decreases. The phase diagram also
shows that when 1.8 ≤ τ ≤ 2.2, the NP has a reduced
lAR value when χ increases. On the other hand, when τ
lies outside the above-mentioned range, χ has no eﬀect
on lAR. For smaller value of τ < 1.8, the NP has an
ellipsoidal shape with a ﬁxed lAR, and for large values of
τ > 2.2, the NP has a spherical shape for all calculated
χ values.

Two typical transitions mentioned above can also be
seen in Figure 3.
In Figure 3a, we present the three
lAR branches of ∆F , the minimal one as τ varies can be
identiﬁed, and ∆F is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between
the actual free energy and the reference free energy of
lAR = 1, for three values of lAR. Figure 3b shows that the
lAR determined by the free energy minimization changes
from lAR = 1.78 to lAR = 1.37 as χ increases from χ = 5.0
to χ = 8.0.

Figure 4a shows that when τ = 2.2 and χ = 5.0, the
free energy has a minimum at lAR = 1.78, indicating the
formation of ellipsoidal NPs. To understand why the NPs
have an equilibrium lAR for a given (χ, τ ), we calculate
the two separate contributions to the total free energy, FP
and EPS, as function of lAR and show it on Figure 4b.
Here, FP is the polymer free energy, including the en-
thalpy and entropy, and EPS is the polymer/solvent in-
terfacial energy. Our results indicate that for ﬁxed values
of the (χ, τ ) parameters, as lAR increases, FP decreases
but EPS increases. The decreased in FP is due to the ori-
entation of the lamellae perpendicular to the long axis.
The BCPs feel the conﬁnement only along the long axis
direction, and not along the short axis.

One of the conclusions is that the conﬁnement be-
comes weaker when the long axis of the ellipsoid becomes
longer. Namely, larger lAR results in less conﬁnement to
the BCP lamellae. However, when lAR increases, the
polymer/solvent interfacial energy increases, resulting in
an increase of EPS. In other words, FP tends to elongate
the NP, while EPS prefers to make it more spherical.
The balance between these two terms determines the ﬁ-
nal shape of the NP. Figure 4b shows that FP is always
negative, therefore, the eﬀect of FP on the NP shape is
stronger when its value is smaller. On the other hand, as
EPS is always positive, its constraining eﬀect on the ﬁnal
shape is stronger when its value is larger.

After understanding why the system has a preferred
aspect ratio, lAR, for a given set of τ and χ, we turn to
the non-monotonic eﬀect of τ on the aspect ratio, lAR.
The phase diagram of Figure 2 shows that as τ increases
from τ = 1.4 to τ = 2.4 (and for ﬁxed χ = 5.5), lAR
ﬁrst increases from lAR = 1.37 to lAR = 1.78, then it
goes back to lAR = 1.37, and ﬁnally its value drops to
lAR = 1.0.

We analysis such non-monotonic behavior by exploring

distinct shapes denote the diﬀerent values of the aspect ratio, lAR, that minimize the free energy. The black square corresponds to
an NP with lAR = 1, red circle corresponds to lAR = 1.37, and blue triangle corresponds to lAR = 1.78 (see legend). The box size
is 10 × 10 in units of L0 = 2π/q0. Other parameter values are: νφρ = 0, H = 6, and K = 0.5.

Other parameter values are: νφρ = 0, H = 6, and K = 0.5.

the dependence of EPS and FP on τ in Figure 5a, where
it is shown that both EPS and FP decrease as τ increases.
This indicates that increasing τ enhances the elongation
eﬀect of FP on the NP shape, but it also weakens the
constraining eﬀect of EPS that causes the NP to be more
spherical. Therefore, as τ increases, FP wins over the
second term and overall the NP becomes more elongated.

When τ is large enough (for example τ = 2.4), the
change in lAR is caused by a diﬀerent mechanism. Fig-
ure 5b shows the dependence of FP and EPS on lAR for
τ = 2.4. In this case, FP is nearly a constant when lAR
varies, and can be explained in the following way. For

large enough τ , the BCPs within the NP undergo strong
segregation, and the polymer free-energy depends mainly
on the enthalpy term and not on the entropy one. There-
fore, FP has only a weak dependence on the NP shape.
However, EPS has a relatively large change when lAR in-
creases from lAR = 1 to lAR = 1.78. This indicates that
for large τ (strong segregation), the NP shape is mainly
determined by the interface energy EPS, causing the NP
to be more spherical.

The eﬀect of χ on lAR manifests itself in two diﬀerent
ways depending on the speciﬁc value of τ . For interme-
diate values, 1.8 ≤ τ ≤ 2.2, increasing χ decreases lAR.

parameter values are: νφρ = 0, H = 6, and K = 0.5.

black line) and EPS (dashed red line) on lAR for τ = 2.4. In all cases, χ = 5.5 and the box size is 10 × 10 in units of L0 = 2π/q0.
Other parameter values are: νφρ = 0, H = 6, and K = 0.5.

However, for τ outside this intermediate range, the ef-
fect of χ on lAR is weak, resulting in almost a constant
value of lAR even when the χ value varies. As is discussed
above, when τ is large enough, the NP shape is mainly
determined by the interfacial energy. Therefore, for the
large value of τ = 2.4, the NP is spherical in a wide range
of χ values.

For smaller τ values, the dependency of EPS and FP
on χ is shown in Figure 6a. It elucidates that increasing
χ increases FP and decreases EPS. Hence, by increasing
FP, the NP becomes more spherical, while decreasing
EPS makes the NP more elongated. By varying the χ
value, the change in the two energy terms is almost the
same, i.e., EPS decreases, while FP increases by the same
order of magnitude, resulting in a balance between these
two energies. This is the reason why the minimum free-
energy gives a ﬁxed lAR for the NP shape.

For intermediate values of τ and for χ = 5.0 and 7.0,
the dependence of ∆FP and ∆EPS on lAR are shown
in Figure 6b, where ∆FP = FP(lAR) − FP(lAR = 1), is
the diﬀerence between FP(lAR) and the reference state
of FP(lAR = 1), and quite similarly ∆EPS is deﬁned.
Figure 6b shows that ∆EPS for χ = 5.0 is nearly the
same as for χ = 7.0. However, for χ = 5.0, ∆FP is
smaller than its value for χ = 7.0. This indicates that
the eﬀect of the interfacial energy EPS on lAR is almost
the same when χ increases, but the eﬀect of FP is a little
weaker for χ = 7.0 than χ = 5.0. This is the reason why
the NP shape becomes less elongated when χ increases.

2. The size eﬀect on the NP shape

In addition to varying τ and χ, we also investigated
the NP size eﬀect on the ﬁnal particle shape. Here, we
use the area of the ellipse S = πab, where a and b are the
two principal axes, to characterize the NP size because
our calculations are done in 2D. For a given area S, we
calculated the free energy of BCP-NPs for various lAR.
The lAR that corresponds to the minimum free energy
is taken as the equilibrium one. Figure 7a shows three
equilibrium shapes of BCP-NPs for S = 8.48, 17.44, and
28.27 with three corresponding equilibrated lAR. The
energy terms, FP and EPS, are plotted in Figure 7b and
7c, respectively, decrease their values as the NP area S
increases. This indicates that increasing the NP size en-
hances the eﬀect of FP, but weaken the constrain eﬀect of
EPS on the equilibrium shape. Therefore, lAR increases
as the size increases, as in clearly seen in Figure 7a.

B. Onion-like Spherical Particles

So far we discussed the neutral solvent case, νφρ = 0.
The resulting NPs have an ellipsoidal shape (in 2D) with
inner BCP lamellae that are perpendicular to the long
axis (L⊥). This phenomenon is also seen in experiments.
Let us now consider the case when the solvent has a pref-
erence towards one of the two blocks, i.e., νφρ (cid:54)= 0. Ex-
periments26 have shown that when the solvent prefers,
say, the B component, an onion-like structure (C(cid:107)) with
a B-shell on the NP perimeter is formed. Clearly, the
opposite occurs if the solvent prefers the A component,
and it will result in an onion-like structure (C(cid:107)) with an
A-shell on its perimeter, in agreement with our calcula-
tions. Next, we would like to investigate how the onion-
like structure that appears when the preference νφρ is
large enough.

Besides the qualitative agreement with experiments,
we ﬁnd that νφρ has a more interesting eﬀect on the NP
shape. Figure 8a shows that by increasing the preference
from νφρ = 0 to 2.5, the NP shape changes from an
ellipsoidal to more spherical, and then to an onion-like
sphere. At the same time, the inner structure changes
from lamellae perpendicular to the long NP axis (L⊥) to a
structure with concentric shells (C(cid:107)). For given values of
τ and χ, a critical value of νφρ = ν∗
φρ is needed to induce
the transition from L⊥ to C(cid:107) structure. Figure 8b shows
that for τ = 1.4, the critical value ν∗
φρ at the transition
increases as χ increases. The transition line, shown in
Figure 8b, separates an upper C(cid:107) phase and an L⊥ phase
from below.

The change in the NP shape and inner structure as a
function of νφρ can also be observed by the dependency
of FP and EPS on νφρ, as shown in Figures 8c and 8d.
Results show that FP is always smaller for L⊥ than for
C(cid:107) structures. However, EPS is always larger for the L⊥
phase than for the C(cid:107). This means that the eﬀect of
FP induces the formation of L⊥ NPs, but EPS leads to
the formation of C(cid:107) with an onion-like inner structure.
As νφρ increases, the EPS diﬀerence between L⊥ and C(cid:107)
becomes larger, and the NP shape changes from L⊥ to
C(cid:107). The spherical L⊥ is the intermediate structure of
this transition.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Comparison with Experiments

Our study of the BCP-NP formation mechanism was
inspired by a recent series of experimental studies.23,24
Shin et al.23 have shown that the NP aspect-ratio lAR
can be controlled by tuning the NP size. They employed
a membrane device made of Shirasu porous glass (SPG)

to generate monodisperse NPs made from PS-b-PB block
copolymers with diﬀerent NP diameters. They found
that the lAR increases as the NP size increases, which
is in excellent agreement with our predictions shown in
Figure 7. The dependence of lAR on the NP size can
be attributed to the fact that the increase in the NP
size enhances the contribution of the bulk energy, and
decreases the surface energy due to the reduced surface
area/volume ratio. The bulk energy includes mainly the
polymer free energy (this is the FP in our calculations).
This can be clearly seen in our work as increasing lAR can
decrease FP (see Figure 4b). For an L⊥ NP, the lamellae
only feel the conﬁnement along the long axis direction.
The larger lAR values imply that the less conﬁnement
is applied to the BCP lamellar phase. In other words,
lamellar BCPs prefer to form elongated NPs with inner
lamellae perpendicular to the long axis (L⊥).

Shin and co-workers24 applied various type of di-
BCP to generate NPs each having a diﬀerent Flory-
Huggins parameter, τ . Their study included PS34k-
b-PB25k, PS16k-b-PDMS17k and PS10k-b-P4VP10k with
τ getting values of τ = 0.04, 0.21 and 0.53, respec-
tively.
They found that lAR increases for the se-
quence of PS34k-b-PB25k, PS16k-b-PDMS17k, and PS10k-
b-P4VP10k. Namely, increasing τ results in an increase
of lAR. Our results not only conﬁrms this ﬁnding, but
also predicts that the NP becomes more spherical again

for larger values of τ . This prediction can be tested in
experiments if the used di-BCPs will cover a larger range
of equivalent τ values.

B. Comparison with Other Models

Our results concerning the dependence of NP shape on
τ and on the NP size are in qualitative agreement with
the theoretical analysis of Ku et al.28 that was based on
a phenomenological coarse-grained free energy. In their
work, the proposed free energy is composed of four terms:
the interfacial energy between A/B blocks, the stretching
energy of di-BCP chains, the bending energy of curved
lamellae, as well as the surface energy at the NP/solvent
interface. The ﬁrst three terms are the bulk energy, while
the last term is the polymer/solvent interfacial energy.
Such a phenomenological free-energy shows that when
lAR increases, the A/B interfacial energy and the bending
energy decrease, but the polymer/solvent surface energy
increases. Moreover, when the NP size increases, the bulk
energy increases, while the last surface energy decreases,
resulting in the increase of lAR. This is in agreement with
our ﬁndings. Their free energy also showed that the bulk
energy increases as τ increases. Therefore, when τ in-
creases, lAR tends to increase in order to reduce the bulk
energy. This is in accord with experimental observations

that lAR increases for BCPs with larger τ . Our results,
however, show a non-monotonous dependency of lAR on
τ . We ﬁnd that the aspect ratio lAR ﬁrst increases and
then decreases as function of continuously increasing τ .
Such predictions can be tested in future experiments by
choosing BCPs that have a larger Flory-Huggins interac-
tion parameter.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we systematically studied the mechanism
of NP formation from di-block copolymers. We show that
a lamellar-forming BCP prefers ellipsoidal NPs with in-
ner lamellae perpendicular to the long axis (called the
L⊥ structure), where the solvent preference to one of the
two blocks is causing the formation of onion-like NPs
with inner lamellae arranged as concentric shells (the C(cid:107)
structure). When the solvent is neutral towards the two
blocks, we showed that more elongated ellipsoidal NPs
can be obtained by increasing the A/B interaction pa-
rameter τ , or by decreasing the polymer/solvent interac-
tion parameter χ, as well as by increasing the NP size.

On the other hand, when the solvent has a preference
towards one of the two blocks, increasing the strength of
this preference induces a change in the NP shape from el-
lipsoidal to spherical, then to onion-like. In a correspond-

ing manner, the inner structure changes from lamellae
perpendicular to the long axis to concentric shells. Our
results not only are consistent with the current experi-
mental ﬁndings, but also predict yet unexplored eﬀects
of how the equilibrium shape of BCP-NPs depends on
experimental controlled parameters.

In this work, we studied BCP forming nanoparticles
for which the BCPs have a lamellar phase in the bulk
and the NP shape is mainly ellipsoidal (in 2D systems).
BCPs that have a cylindrical structure in the bulk have
also been used in the fabrication of nanoparticles. The
resulting NPs have an oblate shape and attracted much
attention.3,13,24,28 However, such theoretical studies have
to go beyond a 2D calculation, they lie beyond the scope
of our present work and are left to future studies. We
hope that the theoretical results presented in this work
can be a useful guide for future experiments as well as
applications for nanoparticles form from BCPs.
