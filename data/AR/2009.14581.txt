ABSTRACT

Aims. We aim to investigate the spatial location of the source of an active region (AR) jet and its relation with associated nonthermal
type III radio emission.
Methods. An emission measure (EM) method was used to study the thermodynamic nature of the AR jet. The nonthermal type III
radio burst observed at meterwavelength was studied using the Murchison Wideﬁeld Array (MWA) radio imaging and spectroscopic
data. The local conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld and the connectivity of the source region of the jet with open magnetic ﬁeld
structures was studied using a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation and potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS) extrapolation
respectively.
Results. The plane-of-sky velocity of the AR jet was found to be ∼136 km/s. The EM analysis conﬁrmed the presence of low
temperature 2 MK plasma for the spire, whereas hot plasma, between 5-8 MK, was present at the footpoint region which also showed
the presence of Fe xviii emission. A lower limit on the electron number density was found to be 1.4×108 cm−3 for the spire and
2.2×108 cm−3 for the footpoint. A temporal and spatial correlation between the AR jet and nonthermal type III burst conﬁrmed the
presence of open magnetic ﬁelds. An NLFFF extrapolation showed that the photospheric footpoints of the null point were anchored at
the location of the source brightening of the jet. The spatial location of the radio sources suggests an association with the extrapolated
closed and open magnetic ﬁelds although strong propagation eﬀects are also present.
Conclusions. The multi-scale analysis of the ﬁeld at local, AR, and solar scales conﬁrms the interlink between diﬀerent ﬂux bundles
involved in the generation of the type III radio signal with ﬂux transferred from a small coronal hole to the periphery of the sunspot
via null point reconnection with an emerging structure.

1. Introduction

At meter wavelengths, the large angular scale solar emission
comprises emission from the solar disk which is produced by
free-free thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. The dominant com-
pact radio sources are mostly associated with active region loca-
tions. These radio sources are produced by the electrons trapped
in the coronal loops. During the bursts, these trapped electrons
are accelerated and escape via open magnetic ﬁeld lines. In this
process, these accelerated electrons emit radio emission (known
as type III radio burst) via the plasma emission mechanism dom-
inantly occurring at the local fundamental frequency ωp, and/or
ne
at harmonics where ωp ∝

√

Ratcliﬀe 2014; Cairns et al. 2018; Krupar et al. 2018; Krasnosel-
skikh et al. 2018). However, the observational signatures of the
open magnetic ﬁeld lines are hard to detect. Using radio imag-
ing, the position of the radio sources can be deduced with respect
to the background EUV event location.

The spatial correlation of the ﬂares and X-ray bursts as well
as type III radio bursts has been known for some time (As-
chwanden et al. 1995; Bastian et al. 1998; Arzner & Benz 2005;
Chen et al. 2013; Reid & Vilmer 2017) and it provides a unique
diagnostic for the nonthermal electrons (up to near-relativistic
speeds), which are released into the heliosphere. This correlation
may become weak with decreasing radio frequencies (speciﬁ-
cally at meter waves). The major reasons for this could be mag-
netic ﬁeld evolution, which appears both structurally and tempo-
rally, in addition to propagation eﬀects, such as coronal scatter-

ing, refraction, and ionospheric eﬀects (Hollweg 1968; Cairns
1995). However, type III diagnostics at various frequencies al-
low us to probe the emission at coronal locations beyond that of
the triggering site. Solar active regions also frequently produce
type III emission associated with EUV jets, that is, jets that are
observed in EUV images of the low corona such as SDO/AIA.
Recently, Klassen et al. (2011); Innes et al. (2011); Mulay et al.
(2016), and Mohan et al. (2019) show a temporal correlation of
type III emission and EUV jets, while Chen et al. (2013) show
the locations of the radio sources at 1-2 GHz in the context of a
jet eruption.

Mulay et al. (2016) carried out a multiwavelength study of
twenty active region jets and found that 85% of jets were tempo-
rally associated with nonthermal type III radio bursts (in the fre-
quency range from 13 MHz to 20 kHz). The spatial correlation
between the EUV jets and type III bursts was studied by extrap-
olating the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld using the potential ﬁeld
source surface (PFSS) technique. The observations were inter-
preted in terms of nonthermal electrons, which accelerated dur-
ing the reconnection outﬂow that was produced during the event,
and then they escaped into the heliosphere along open ﬁeld lines.
Indeed, PFSS modeling always shows the presence of open ﬁeld
lines near the source region of the EUV jets that are close to the
sunspots. This led the authors to conclude that AR jets are tem-
porally and spatially associated with nonthermal type III radio
emission.

The fact that active region jets connect the source region
that is next to a sunspot to the heliosphere is now of particu-
lar relevance for one of the main scientiﬁc goals of the Solar
Orbiter (Müller et al. 2013), which is to link the in-situ measure-
ments of the solar wind to the source region where the solar wind
originated. Such linking is notoriously diﬃcult to establish, but
having clear signatures, such as jets, would really help to make
the connection unambiguous. On the other hand, we note that
magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations always carry with them some un-
certainties related to the modeling, the resolution of the photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld, etc. Clearly, more reliable information on
the source location of the type III bursts would be obtained with
simultaneous imaging and spectral observations at radio wave-
lengths.

Unfortunately, radio imaging telescopes are not available
for the frequency range from 13 MHz to 20 kHz which cov-
ers the interplanetary type III emission studied by Mulay et al.
(2016). However, imaging and frequency observations are avail-
able at higher frequencies, which are formed in the lower corona,
around one solar radii or below. Active regions typically emit
during their lifetimes, the so-called radio noise storms, and have
a persistent broad-band emission in the 100–500 MHz range,
which is thought to be associated with nonthermal electrons that
continuously accelerate to relatively low energies. Del Zanna
et al. (2011) studied such events observed with the Nancay
radioheliograph (NRH) at frequencies between 150 MHz and
432 MHz, and found a spatial correlation between their loca-
tion and the places where interchange reconnection would be ex-
pected to take place, on the basis of magnetic ﬁeld modeling. Del
Zanna et al. (2011) propose a uniﬁed physical interpretation of
these noise storms and the so-called coronal outﬂows, which are
open-ﬁeld regions associated with sunspots where coronal lines
form above 1 MK and show moderate outﬂows (10–20 km/s).

At their low-frequency end, noise storms are often found
to be accompanied by interplanetary type III emission. In the
lower frequency range, the recently developed ground-based ra-
dio imaging instrument, Murchison Wideﬁeld Array (MWA;
Tingay et al. 2013; Lonsdale et al. 2009) is a suitable instrument

for the study of type III emission. It is capable of simultaneously
providing dynamic spectrum and radio imaging in the frequency
range from 80 MHz to 300 MHz. MWA is designed to provide
observations at higher coronal heights which can be further com-
pared with interplanetary radio emission.

After a careful search through the MWA data sets, we found
a nonthermal type III radio burst, which is associated with an on-
disk active region EUV jet (AR jet). The radio imaging helped
to locate the radio sources in the lower corona during the jet
activity and also helped to identify the source location for the
interplanetary counterparts of type III emission, which were de-
tected by the WAVES instrument. A comprehensive analysis has
been carried out to understand the spatial and temporal correla-
tion between the AR jet and type III burst.

This study provides an important opportunity to advance our
understanding of plasma parameters, propagation of energetic
particles in the solar atmosphere, and the role of photospheric
and coronal magnetic activity in the ejection of active region
jets. In this paper, the initiation of jet activity has been thor-
oughly studied using the line-of-sight and vector magnetic ﬁeld
data from the HMI instrument. The observed structure of the jet
was compared to that of the extrapolated coronal magnetic ﬁeld
as determined with two diﬀerent methods, a nonlinear force-free
ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation and a potential ﬁeld source surface
(PFSS) one. The study focused on understanding the dynamics
involved in the photosphere as well as the changes and evolution
of the magnetic structure at coronal heights.

The paper is structured as follows: UV and EUV imaging
observations of the jet from AIA and radio observations from
MWA are discussed in Sections 2 and 3 respectively. The photo-
spheric magnetic extrapolations are presented in Section 4. We
compare the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld with radio sources in
Section 5 and the results are summarized in Section 6.

2. UV and EUV imaging observations from AIA

The AIA instrument observed a series of homologous and re-
current AR jets on September 2 and 3, 2013. In this paper,
we focus on one AR jet event observed on September 3, 2013
where we have simultaneous radio imaging and spectroscopic
observations from MWA, and EUV and UV imaging from AIA.
High-resolution (0.6(cid:48)(cid:48)), high-cadence (12 sec) full disk AIA data
was obtained and prepared by following the standard procedure
(aia_prep.pro). The AIA channels were co-aligned using the
sunspot as a reference region.

Figure 1 (left panel) shows a leading sunspot in the AIA
1700 Å channel, which is associated with active region NOAA
11836 (N11 W10)1. The jet originated from the southern umbral-
penumbral boundary of the leading sunspot. The activity was ex-
amined in all AIA channels before, during and after the jet evo-
lution, that is, between 03:30 - 04:15 UT (See online Movie 1).
Figure 1 (middle and right panel) and Figure 2 show a jet ob-
served in diﬀerent AIA channels. The jet activity started with
a brightening at the footpoint at 03:48 UT in all AIA channels
and the jet plasma disappeared by 04:03 UT. We recorded the
lifetime of the jet as ∼15 min. During the evolution of the jet,
a small loop structure formed at the footpoint region (shown by
a small black arrow in the AIA 94 Å channel in Fig. 2). One
end of this loop is rooted in the umbral-penumbral boundary of
the sunspot and in a region that is south of the sunspot. The jet
originated from the southern edge of the light-bridge region and

showed an untwisting motion of the spire (the same as was seen
for the jet on August 10, 2010 as studied by Mulay et al. 2016).
The images in the AIA 171 (see Fig. 3, left panel), 193, and
211 Å (see Fig. 2) channels show that the sunspot region was the
source of a myriad of loops that obscured the footpoint region
of the jet. Sunspot waves were observed to propagate along the
EUV loops. They might aﬀect the initiation mechanism of the

jet, as discussed for another recurrent jet, as studied by Chandra
et al. (2015).

The AIA 304 Å channel is multi-thermal but on-disk dom-
inated by cool He II emission. Having a peak sensitivity at
log T [K] = 4.7, the AIA 304 Å channel shown in the bottom

chored in the sunspot. A brightening at the footpoint and un-

twisting motion of the spire is also seen in AIA 304 Å images.
During the evolution of the jet, the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) did not observe any signiﬁcant
enhancement in X-ray ﬂux, such as a solar ﬂare.

2.1. Plane-of-sky velocities using AIA 171 Å images

High cadence (12 sec) images from the AIA 171 Å channel
(dominated by the Fe IX 171.07 Å line formed at log T [K] =
5.85) during the evolution of the jet were used for a time-distance
analysis. Figure 3 shows the jet (left panel) observed at 04:00 UT
in the AIA 171 Å channel. The white line shows an artiﬁcial slit
positioned along the jet-spire, which was used to measure the
variation in the intensities as a function of time (right panel).
The time-distance plot shows that the spire of the jet consisted
of multiple thin strands. We calculated an average plane-of-sky
velocity to be ∼136 km/s along white dashed lines. The result
is found to be consistent with the range of values reported by
Mulay et al. (2016).

2.2. Emission measure analysis

We performed an emission measure (EM) analysis using the
inversion method developed by Cheung et al. (2015) to study
the thermal structure of the jet plasma. We coaligned AIA im-
ages in six channels (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 Å) dur-
ing the jet evolution at 03:58:01 UT. The method computes the
temperature responses for six AIA channels (using the solarsoft
routine aia_get_response.pro), using the CHIANTI atomic
database (Dere et al. 1997) and coronal abundances (by com-
bining the abundances from Feldman et al. (1992), Grevesse
& Sauval (1998), and Landi et al. (2002)). Since most parts
of the footpoint region were blocked by the sunspot loops, we
subtracted the pre-jet image at 03:00 UT from the jet image at
03:58:01 UT. The sunspot loops were removed in the subtracted
images, which provided a clear view of the jet structure. The EM
analysis was carried out using these subtracted images.

Figure 4 (right panel, column 1 and 2) shows EM maps at
various temperature intervals. These EM maps show that multi-
thermal plasma was present in the spire (log T [K] = 6.1 - 6.5
(1.3-3 MK)) as well as in the footpoint (log T [K] = 6.1 - 6.9
(1.3-8 MK)). Furthermore, we calculated EM curves (see Fig. 4,
left panel) for the spire and footpoint averaged over the blue and

Article number, page 4 of 13

red boxed regions respectively. The EM curve for the spire (blue
curve) showed two peaks; the ﬁrst peak at log T [K] = 5.8 (0.6
MK) and the second peak at log T [K] = 6.3 (2 MK) (peak EM
= 7.3×1026 cm−5). The EM curve for the spire is not well con-
strained for log T < 5.8 and > 6.4, and it falls sharply. The EM
curve for the footpoint (red curve) peaked at log T [K] = 6.8
(6.3 MK) (peak EM = 2.8×1027 cm−5). The EM curve for the
footpoint is not well constrained for log T < 6.3 and > 6.9, hence
it falls sharply and it also shows spurious enhancement of EM in
the low (high) temperature range, that is, log T < 6.0 (>7.0). A
small loop structure at the footpoint region (the same as seen in
the AIA 94 Å image of Fig. 2) is nicely observed in the EM maps
created at log T [K] = 6.7 to 6.9 (right panel, column 2, bottom
panel). This result shows that the high temperature of 5-8 MK
was present at the footpoint region.

Furthermore, we investigated the reliability of high temper-
atures as seen in the footpoint region by estimating Fe xviii
93.932 Å emission from the AIA 94 Å channel. We used the em-
pirical formula (I(Fe xviii (93.93 Å)) = I(94 Å) - I(211 Å)/120
- I(171 Å)/450) given by Del Zanna (2013). The method uses a
combination of three AIA channels (94, 211, and 171 Å). It re-
moves the low temperature component from AIA 94 Å images
and provides Fe xviii 93.932 Å emission. Figure 4 (right panel,
column 3) shows the estimated Fe xviii 93.932 Å emission in the
jet at 03:57 (top panel) and 03:58 UT (bottom panel). The AR jet
structure seen at 03:58 UT is very similar to that which was seen
in the EM map created at log T [K] = 6.7 - 6.9. Fe xviii 93.932 Å
is formed over a broad range of temperatures, and its maximum
abundance is at log T [K] = 6.85. The analysis conﬁrms the pres-
ence of high temperatures of log T [K] = 6.8 (6.3 MK) in the
footpoint region, which are consistent with the line formation
(peak) temperature of Fe xviii 93.932 Å.

By assuming a cylindrical geometry, we measured the width
of the spire as 3(cid:48)(cid:48) and 6(cid:48)(cid:48) for the footpoint from AIA images.
We considered the column depth of the plasma along the line of
sight to be the same as the widths and calculated a lower limit of
the electron number density (Ne). We measured the total EM for
the spire (5.4<log T<6.8) and footpoint (5.4<log T<7.5) (see Ta-
ble 1). By assuming a ﬁlling factor equal to unity, a lower limit of
the electron number density (Ne) was found to be 1.4×108 cm−3
for the spire and 2.2×108 cm−3 for the footpoint. The density in
the footpoint was found to be somewhat higher than the spire
region.

3. Nonthermal type III radio emission

3.1. Radio spectrum analysis

MWA took solar observations under proposal G0002 on Septem-
ber 3, 2013 from 03:40 to 04:40 UT and observed a group of non-
thermal type III radio bursts in the lower corona from 03:48:16
to 04:04:48 UT. MWA observations have ten coarse frequency
bands in the frequency range from 101 MHz to 298 MHz. Each
coarse band has 64 ﬁne spectral channels with a frequency reso-
lution of 40 kHz and a temporal resolution of 0.5 sec. The inter-
planetary counterpart of the type III burst was observed by the
WAVES instrument2 (Bougeret et al. 1995) onboard the WIND
spacecraft3 in the frequency range from 13 MHz to ∼200 kHz.

Figure 5 shows half a second averaged radio dynamic spec-
trum from MWA (top panel) and a one-minute averaged radio
spectrum obtained from WAVES (middle and bottom panel).
The solar ﬂux calibration for the MWA radio spectrum was per-
formed using the baseline-based technique using a priori infor-
mation about the well characterized MWA tiles and a sky model
(Oberoi et al. 2017). The MWA spectrum clearly shows that the
type III burst consists of some individual columns of energy re-
leases, along with many ﬁne structures. The columns of type III
bursts show diverse values for drifts. The peak energy release at
03:52 UT in the MWA spectrum continues in the WAVES dy-
namic spectrum; this eventually leads to an interplanetary type
III radio burst. The ﬁne structures observed in the dynamic spec-
trum show a large variety in their time and frequency spans. Both
lower coronal and interplanetary nonthermal type III emission

were found to be temporally well correlated with the AR jet and
provide evidence of particle acceleration during the jet ejection.

3.2. Radio imaging analysis using MWA

The spatial information for the type III radio burst was obtained
by imaging the radio sources. The radio imaging at multiple fre-
quencies facilitates the study of propagation as well as the move-
ment of radio sources in the lower corona during the jet activity.
For this study, three frequencies 101, 165, and 298 MHz were
selected from MWA radio data. The extreme bands of 101 MHz
and 298 MHz span a large range of coronal heights (see Table 4),
with 298 MHz being closest to, and 101 MHz being farthest
from, the eruption site. The Common Astronomy Software Ap-
plications package4 (CASA) was used to process the MWA raw
data. The standard radio analysis including calibration and de-
convolution was carried out.

The propagation eﬀects through inhomogeneous and dy-
namic Earth’s ionosphere posed a major challenge in determin-
ing the accurate source position at meterwaves. They can be seen
as a shift in the positions of radio sources in the radio images
(Thejappa & MacDowall 2008). In our analysis, a shift of a few
arcmins in the solar position was observed. Therefore, a shift in
the absolute location of the center of the Sun is present in the
radio images with respect to the EUV solar images. This shift
was corrected by computing the center of the solar disk using
contour ﬁtting to the solar disk in the radio images.

Figure 6 shows radio images at three frequencies, which rep-
resent thermal emission at the radio quiet time at 03:48 UT. From
the radio observations, it is known that the solar disk emission in
the frequency range from 101 MHz to 298 MHz is produced by
free-free emission.

The free-free emission disk is best captured at the lower con-
tour levels. The center of the Sun at each frequency was com-
puted by ﬁtting ten contours (contours plotted as 0.4-4.0% of
the peak ﬂux at that frequency), which are shown in yellow. For
a point of reference, the two white circles shown in each panel
have radii 1 R(cid:12) and 2 R(cid:12), the smaller one represents the limb of
the optical solar disk. As we expect, the size of the radio solar

10−22 W/m2Hz. The ﬂux calibration has not been carried out for the WAVES spectrum, hence the colors show some arbitrary units of intensity.

disk increases with decreasing frequencies, that is, the radio solar
disk at 101 MHz is bigger than the radio solar disk at 298 MHz.
This further conﬁrms that the emission at higher (lower) frequen-
cies originated at lower (higher) heights in the solar atmosphere.
The blue dots represent the computed centroids.

The root mean square (RMS) was computed for the centroid
positions at each frequency on the two Cartesian (X and Y) and
the radial coordinates (r) in the units of radio pixel (1 pixel =
50(cid:48)(cid:48)). Table 2 shows the standard deviation σ of the position of
the center of the optical solar disk in the Cartesian and radial
directions. All RMS values are within one pixel, demonstrating
the robustness in calculating the position of the center of the Sun.
Furthermore, the center of the optical disk and center of the radio
solar disk were identiﬁed and coaligned with respect to EUV
images.

3.3. Spatial-temporal study

During the jet evolution, it was observed that the signatures of
type III radio bursts appeared in columns in the MWA spectrum.
Figure 7 (top panel) shows the frequency averaged light curves
for 101, 165, and 298 MHz. The spiky nature of the emission
indicates nonthermal emission. Based on the high prevalence of
impulsive nonthermal emission, we classiﬁed the four periods of
bursts as I to IV (shown as purple patches in Fig. 7. top panel).
Details about these periods and their duration are given in Ta-
ble 3. In addition to the burst periods, we observed impulsive

emission comes in periods I-IV.

In Fig. 7, the black lines represent the start (solid line) at
03:48 UT and end (dashed line) times at 04:03 UT of the EUV

burst starts at 03:49:28 UT, 100 sec after the EUV eruption onset
(03:48 UT). The strength of impulsive emission are strongest
in the 167-270 MHz band and signiﬁcantly weaker outside this
band.

The radio images at 101, 165, and 298 MHz show the pres-
ence of bright compact radio sources in the vicinity of the jet

eruption. Figure 8 shows the period averaged radio sources for
three frequency bands overplotted on the AIA 171 Å images
during the jet eruption. The centroids showed a signiﬁcant po-
sitional variation for the four periods of bursts. For period I, it is
observed that the radio sources at 298 MHz were closer to the jet
eruption site, whereas radio sources at 165 MHz and 101 MHz
were spread over a larger area and appeared farther from the jet
eruption site. For subsequent periods II-IV, the 165 MHz source
roughly moves along the direction of the yellow arrow, whereas
the 101 MHz source is much more inclined as compared to the
PSF and shows more complicated variations.

Table 4 shows the mean and RMS of the radial distance of
the dominant radio sources from the EUV eruption site. Figure 7
(bottom panel) shows the location of the centroids for the four
period of bursts for all three frequencies from the distance of
the jet eruption. The maximum variation of the centroids for the
four period of bursts was obtained for 101 MHz at about ∼117".
Larger positional ﬂuctuations of 124" were seen for 298 MHz
within Band-I (also seen in Fig. 7, bottom panel). However, it is
important to note that these shifts are within the two to three PSF
region (see Table 2 and 4).

In a type-III burst, the energetic electrons travel along the
magnetic ﬁeld lines, interacting with the local Langmuir waves
and creating the radio sources along the ﬁeld lines. The emis-
sion at a frequency ω comes from a coronal height where the
local plasma frequency (or its harmonics) are equal to ωp. In a
simpliﬁed scenario, the locations of the radio sources at various
ωp systematically align with the direction of propagation of the
energetic electrons, primarily along the ﬁeld lines (Chen et al.
2015). Some of these emission spots are shown on the extrapo-
lated magnetic ﬁeld lines (see Section 5) in Fig. 8.

The observed radio sources shown in Fig. 8 do not follow a
simplistic picture. Radio sources, particularly at low-frequencies
are expected to show deviations from their true positions. Propa-
gation eﬀects like refraction, scattering, and wave-ducting could
be responsible for these shifts. In the present event, due to it’s

central location, the refraction is expected to be minimal. Scat-
tering is a major phenomenon in shifting the positions of radio
sources (Steinberg et al. 1971). Many studies done on scattering
have revealed shifts due to density ﬂuctuations (e.g. Thejappa &
Kundu 1994; Krupar et al. 2018). The density inhomogeneities
can occur due to the uneven distribution of plasma along the
loop. They impact the apparent radio source location, mostly
when present in the vicinity of the emission location. These
shifts (see Table 4) increase with decreasing frequencies (Robin-
son 1983). The scenario becomes more complex in an eruption
due to dynamic changes associated with the emitting source it-
self. The emitting source moves, thus creating a scattered trav-
eling apparent radio source. Figure 7 (bottom panel) shows the
source movement in the imaging plane. This direction of the mo-
tion from period I to IV is radially away for 298 MHz, while it
becomes irregular for 165 MHz and 101 MHz. The density in-
homogeneities can vary temporally from jet eruption at MHD
timescales. However, the abrupt large shifts observed (298 MHz
in Fig. 7) are too fast for a scattering process. Two clear cases
of clustering in the 298 MHz sources, one at the radial distance
100(cid:48)(cid:48) to 300(cid:48)(cid:48) and another at 500(cid:48)(cid:48) to 600(cid:48)(cid:48), suggest a secondary
source. Eruption processes are known to be fragmentary and can
be produced in the secondary sources away from the eruption
site. Furthermore, there are ﬁne temporal shifts within each pe-
riod, which are captured in the smeared extended radio sources
(Fig. 7, especially for 101 MHz). The smearing occurs due to
the image averaging over the duration of the respective periods.
The combination of scattering and intrinsic source movement are
responsible for the complex motion.

3.4. Temporal evolution of radio brightness temperature

Figure 9 shows a temporal evolution of the brightness tempera-
ture TB of the radio sources observed at 101, 165, and 298 MHz.
The radio quiet time at 03:48 UT was chosen as the start time
for this plot. Before the nonthermal type III burst, the TB for the
three frequencies was quite similar and close to the quiet Sun
thermal temperature (Oberoi et al. 2017). The brightness temper-
atures were computed over 90% contours. The impulsive emis-
sion seen in the time series represent the nonthermal emission at
diﬀerent frequencies. The time series shows a higher prevalence
of nonthermal emission at the 298 MHz band, which decreases
with decreasing frequency (higher height). The brightness tem-
perature light curve shows the presence of numerous short lived

4. Modeling the local and global magnetic ﬁeld

The jet activity was examined using images in the AIA 211 Å
channel. The area of origin for the eruptions was just south of a
compact sunspot, covering approximately an area of ∼40 arcsec2
from the footpoint of the jet. The brightening was observed at
the footpoint, which was associated with the southern end of
the light bridge region. A small coronal hole was located to the
southeast of the sunspot.

In this section, we investigate the magnetic structures associ-
ated with the source region of the jet and their connectivity with
the open magnetic ﬁeld structure and the nonthermal type III
radio bursts. The aim was to check if there was a possible mag-
netic connection between the relatively small structure where the
brightening occurred and the very large scale of the open mag-
netic ﬁeld region.

The coronal magnetic ﬁeld can be reconstructed from the
remote observations of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The
corona is force-free on temporal and spatial scales. The force-
free assumption is also true for plasma in thermal equilibrium,
which is dominated by the magnetic ﬁeld. Additionally, under
this assumption, the Lorentz force resulting from the interaction
between ﬁeld and currents vanishes everywhere. The force-free
extrapolation technique solves the corresponding set of equa-
tions under the constraint that the ﬁeld reproduces the observed
photospheric values.

Because of the numerical eﬀorts required for extrapolation,
a multi-scale approach is considered here. This involves two dif-
ferent types of magnetic extrapolations: NLFFF and PFSS ex-
trapolation. Firstly, the local conﬁguration for the magnetic ﬁeld
of the jet was obtained using the general nonlinear force-free ex-
trapolation technique. The method was applied to a ﬁeld of view
covering the entire active region area. The high-resolution (about
0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data was obtained from
the Space weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP)5 series
of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) (Scherrer et al.
2012; Schou et al. 2012) on September 3, 2013 at 03:36 UT,
which covered the entire active region and nearby area.

The NLFFF magnetic extrapolation was obtained by us-
ing the method described in Valori et al. (2010) and references
therein. The analysis was performed in a similar way to that re-
ported in section 6.1 of Polito et al. (2017). Figure 10 shows the
NLFFF model of the lower coronal magnetic ﬁeld structure as-
sociated with the active region and the source region of the jet.

A zoomed view of the source region of the jet is shown in

the outer penumbra of the sunspot, which was in the proximity
of the light bridge. This is the same region where the footpoint
of the jet is rooted (which is shown in Fig. 1 with a cyan line).

The spine surmounted a convection cell where ﬂux was seen
continuing to emerge. The fan ﬁeld lines are also shown where

some deformation was present, which was likely due to the prox-
imity of the vertical boundary of the extrapolation domain. The

sunspot. A good qualitative agreement between the rooted ﬁeld
lines of the null and the location of the brightening was obtained.

From the sunspot in the proximity of the spine footpoint,
ﬁeld lines are present (shown as blue lines in Fig. 10) that have
a very diﬀerent orientation and leave the extrapolation box from
the lateral side. These were possibly open ﬁeld lines, but their
nature could not be aﬃrmed because of the small size of the ex-
trapolation box. In order to test such a hypothesis, a large-scale
PFSS extrapolation was carried out.

To model the coronal magnetic ﬁeld at a global scale, a PFSS
extrapolation was also computed. Such an approximation is suit-
able to represent the average solar force-free magnetic ﬁeld at
large scales, but it fails at modeling structures that are strongly
inﬂuenced by the presence of coronal currents. The radial mag-
netic ﬁeld at the coronal base required by the PFSS method was
ﬁxed based on the synoptic magnetogram provided by the HMI
instrument for CR-2141, resampled at half resolution. The Fi-
nite Diﬀerence Iterative Solver (FDIPS), developed by Tóth et al.
(2011), was run on a spherical grid with a source surface radius
set at 2.5 R(cid:12), with 75 uniform radial bins, 1440 latitude bins (uni-
form in cosine of latitude), and 3600 uniform longitude bins.

olation, traced from the same set of starting points of the lines

dicate closed and open ﬁeld lines, respectively. The ﬁgures show

reasonable consistency between the topology of both models in
terms of closed and open structures.

As in the NLFFF extrapolation, the red ﬁeld lines represent
an envelope ﬁeld above the active region and they started from
the eastern side of the sunspot (see Fig. 12). The blue ﬁeld lines
started from the western side of the spot, and are indeed open,
in the sense that instead of connecting back to the photospheric
surface, they intercept the upper boundary of the model, placed
at two solar radii.

5. Comparison of the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld

with radio sources

As previously mentioned, the radio sources ideally originate
from the ν = νp surfaces under simple stratiﬁed solar corona
and under the absence of propagation eﬀects. But as seen in
the radio images, these assumptions are quite far from reality
as meterwaves suﬀer from strong refraction and scattering in the
corona. Figure 8 shows the expected position of the radio sources
at 101, 165, and 298 MHz on the magnetic ﬁeld lines assum-
ing the Newkirk coronal density model (Newkirk 1961) (assum-
ing 4×Ne active region coronal densities). Using the magnetic
ﬁeld lines derived from extrapolation in Section 4, a few large
scale closed and open ﬁeld lines were chosen for the representa-
tion. The computed source positions on the ﬁeld lines show the
diverse spatial locations adding to the complexity of the radio
source location.

We observed the expected locations of the 298 MHz source
close within a 1-2 PSF element in relation to its apparent ob-
served locations. While the observed 100 MHz radio sources are
located far from its expected location on the open magnetic ﬁeld.
This is expected as the longer wavelengths would be relatively
more impacted by scattering and refraction (Li et al. 2012; The-
jappa et al. 2012). However the 165 MHz source appears toward
the east of the eruption site. Interestingly, the observed sources
for 165 MHz appear to come from the near loop top regions of
large scale closed magnetic ﬁelds. We know that wave ducting
can also cause shifts in the radio source position under speciﬁc
conditions of the emission angle with the coronal loop bound-
aries and make them appear near the apex of the loops (Duncan
1979). The radio waves can be ducted away from the original
source location, later showing up near the apex of the loop (up
to 500(cid:48)(cid:48) far) (Bisoi et al. 2018).

The model regarding the extrapolation of magnetic ﬁelds
is simplistic as it does not include the local small scale varia-
tions. These local variations in magnetic ﬁelds along with den-
sity inhomogeneities can impact the apparent position of the ra-
dio sources. Overall, when compared with the observed MWA
radio sources, the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld presents a contrast
in the calculated radio source locations. However, the observed
sources are compatible with the observed contrast in extrapo-
lated magnetic ﬁelds.

6. Summary and discussion

In this paper, we carried out a comprehensive investigation of an
active region jet and a nonthermal type III radio burst by com-
bining data from various observatories, such as EUV imaging
data from AIA/SDO, radio imaging and spectrum from MWA,
and photospheric magnetic data from HMI/SDO. The EUV jet
showed a complex evolution of the thermal plasma, which is
trapped in the complex magnetic structure of the active region.
The changes in the topology of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld were

evident from the untwisting motion of the jet plasma along its
axis. The plane-of-sky velocity of the AR jet was found to be
∼136 km/s. The EM analysis conﬁrms that the hot plasma of
temperature 5-8 MK was present at the footpoint region and also
showed the presence of Fe xviii 93.93 Å emission, whereas the
spire was at a low temperature of 2 MK. The spire temperature
was found to be in good agreement with the temperatures ob-
tained in other studies of AR jets (Mulay et al. 2016, 2017).
The electron number densities in the spire and footpoint were
found to be an order of magnitude lower compared to the densi-
ties measured for other jets studied by Mulay et al. (2016, 2017,
2018). However, these are lower limits.

A temporal and spatial correlation between the AR jet and
nonthermal type III burst was conﬁrmed using the radio imag-
ing. The radio emission of the event showed a high prevalence
of ﬁne structures in TB, frequency, and time, thus showing the
complexities involved in the plasma emission mechanisms.

The type III burst mainly occur during four periods span-
ning the entire meterwave wavelength range corresponding to
0.13–0.54 R(cid:12) (Table 4). During these periods, radio emission
took place over a wide range of frequencies, which can be inter-
preted as the source regions that are located at diﬀerent coronal
heights. The large diﬀerences (from 0.13-0.52 R(cid:12) above the sur-
face) between the emission heights of the three radio frequency
bands suggest the presence of the open magnetic ﬁelds. These
open magnetic ﬁeld lines facilitate the movement of nonther-
mal electrons into the interplanetary medium and produce ra-
dio emission at lower frequencies (as seen in Fig. 5, middle and
bottom panel). However, the above mentioned portrayal of the
eruption phenomenon seems simplistic. Radio imaging shows
signiﬁcant shifts in the source location at diﬀerent frequencies
in no systematic manner. Such behavior strongly suggests the
presence of propagation eﬀects, such as refraction and scattering
that are created by strong, dynamic density inhomogeneities.

The local conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld at the location
of the jet was studied using the NLFFF extrapolation. The anal-
ysis shows that the photospheric footpoints of the null point (see
Fig. 11) were anchored at the location of the source brightening
of the jet (see Fig. 1). The connectivity of the source region of
the jet with open magnetic ﬁeld structure was studied using the
PFSS extrapolation.

Force-free extrapolations are equilibrium solutions and,
therefore, do not allow for the direct modeling of the reconnec-
tion between ﬁeld lines, which is an intrinsically dynamical pro-
cess. However, the information about the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁg-
uration discussed in Section 4 allows the depiction of a plausible
scenario for the process yielding the jets and radio bursts, which
is sketched in Fig. 13.

Furthermore, the charted locations for ω = ωp on various
open and closed ﬁeld lines (see Fig. 8) presents numerously plau-
sible locations for the radio sources. However, in reality, the ra-
dio sources suﬀer from propagation eﬀects. The plasma distri-
bution in the loop from the jet eruption may be responsible for
enhancing density inhomogeneities. By comparing the ω = ωp
locations on the loops with the observed radio source locations,
we conclude that there is the presence of strong scattering in
the apparent radio source locations, which are well-correlated in
their temporal proﬁles.

Next, we summarize a proposed physical scenario that is
consistent with both the observational data and the magnetic
models. Figure 13 illustrates the proposed coronal magnetic con-
ﬁguration of the region analyzed in this work. It is surmised that
a convection cell brought up ﬁeld lines between the sunspot and
the null (in green in Fig. 13), which were pushed toward the null

point. Nulls are the preferential location where reconnection can
occur, in particular, between the emerging ﬂux and the ambient
open ﬁeld lines at the right hand side of the null (the lower lying
blue ﬁeld line is on the right hand side in Fig. 13). Such open
ﬁeld lines were provided by a small coronal hole that was lo-
cated on the southeast side of the active region. The product of
the reconnection was two sets of ﬁeld lines: one is represented in
Fig. 13 by the long ﬁeld line that connects the periphery of the
sunspot with the open ﬁeld, the other is shown by the small pink
loop below the null. Brightening would be expected at the foot-
point of such reconnected ﬁeld lines and it was indeed observed
at the location of the footpoint of the ﬁeld lines. On the other
hand, the newly formed red ﬁeld lines connecting to the open
ﬁeld were also energized by the reconnection, yielding the radio
burst. Since the convection cell was steadily bringing up new
ﬂux, such a process could essentially be repeated in the same
way over and over, yielding the homologous nature of the jets
and radio bursts.

Fig. 13. Schematic of topology of magnetic ﬁeld at footpoint region of
jet. The scenario explains the reconnection process linking the recurrent
jets and the type III radio burst.

The multi-scale analysis of the ﬁeld at local, AR, and solar-
scales conﬁrms the interlink between diﬀerent ﬂux bundles in-
volved in the generation of the type III radio signal with ﬂux
transferred from a small coronal hole to the periphery of the
sunspot via null point reconnection with an emerging structure.
In this scenario, the sunspot light bridge did not have an active
role in the process, but it was likely associated to the region
of strong connectivity gradient separating that is open from AR
ﬁeld lines. PFSS extrapolations from higher resolution synoptic
maps are necessary in order to check such a feature, which we
reserve for future research.
