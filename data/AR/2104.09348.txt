Abstract

Light scattering due to the interaction of photons and acoustic waves present in a dilute inert
gas is analyzed through the use of irreversible thermodynamics. The dispersion relation,
which governs the dynamics of the density ﬂuctuation of the gas allows the establishment
of a simple criterion for the corresponding Rayleigh-Brillouin spectrum to be observed. The
criterion here proposed allows a clear physical interpretation and suggests generalizations
for other interesting physical scenarios.

Introduction

Density ﬂuctuations in a dilute gas in local equilibrium cause light scattering due to Doppler
interactions between the incoming photons and the acoustic modes of the ﬂuid. This eﬀect was
ﬁrst predicted by L. Brilouin [1] and described theoretically by Landau and Placzek [2]. The
spectrum reﬂects the dynamic behavior of density ﬂuctuations and constitutes an experimental
test of linear irreversible thermodynamics.

It is well-known that, in the Euler regime, the transport equations that describe the ﬂuctua-

tions of the local thermodynamic variables of a simple static ﬂuid read [3]:

where δρ corresponds to the density ﬂuctuations around the equilibrium state ρ0, δT the
temperature ﬂuctuations around T0 and δθ = ∇ · (δ~u) the expansion rate of the gas. These equa-
tions predict the existence of sound waves in the ﬂuid which propagate with speed characteristic
speed CT , given by

In Eq. (4), m is the individual mass of the particles present in the system, T is the temperature
and k is the Boltzmann constant.

The interaction of light with the waves present in a dilute static ﬂuid is rather diﬃcult to
measure [4, 5]. For a given spatial mode k, the speciﬁc ﬂuid-photon interaction depends on the
density of the ﬂuid. In this context, the Brillouin scattering is far more easy to be detected for
high density systems rather than dilute gases. On the other hand, low density ﬂuids are frequent
in astrophysical scenarios in which structures may be formed at very long wavelengths [6]. This
motivates the analysis of the conditions for the existence of acoustic waves in dilute ﬂuids.

In the presence of dissipation, Eqs. (1-3) must include transport coeﬃcients that take into
account viscosity and heat conductivity, these eﬀects may prevent the existence of sound waves
in a dilute gas.

The purpose of the present work is to establish a necessary condition that must be satisﬁed
in order to guarantee the existence of complex roots in the dispersion relation corresponding
to the linearized transport system. If only real roots are present, no Brillouin doublet can be
observed in a given experimental array. To accomplish this task the paper has been divided as
follows: In section two, the dispersion relation that describes the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations
present in a simple dissipative ﬂuid is expressed in terms of only one dissipative parameter, the
relaxation time τr. In section 3, the necessary condition for the existence of three real roots of
the dispersion relation is established and a numerical example relevant in low density physics is
presented. Final remarks are included in section 4.

2 Dispersion relation in the presence of dissipation

For a simple dilute gas consisting of hard spheres, Eq. (1) remains invariant in the presence of
dissipation, while Eqs. (2-3) become [4]:

(6)

In Eq.

(5 - 6), δΠ corresponds to the stress tensor ﬂuctuations and ~J[Q] corresponds to
the heat ﬂux. If kinetic theory is applied within the BGK approximation [7], two constitutive
equations can be established, namely

δΠ = −ηsδσ,

and

δ ~J[Q] = −κth∇ (δT ) ,
where σ corresponds to the traceless symmetric part of the velocity gradient, ηs is the shear
viscosity and κth the thermal conductivity of the gas.
The introduction of the constitutive equations in the set (5 - 6) leads to

The system (9) governs the dynamics of the ﬂuctuations of the local thermodynamic variables of
the gas. Real values for s in the dispersion relation det(A) = 0 are identiﬁed with exponentially
decaying modes. The resulting expression reads:

In the next section, a simple geometrical analysis of the dispersion relation is applied in order
to establish a necessary condition for the existence of two diﬀerent complex roots, which in turn
correspond to the presence of acoustic waves in the gas.

The inﬂection point of f (s) is always located at s = − 8
T q2τr. In the absence of
dissipation, f (s) is symmetric with respect of the inﬂection point, which in this case is located
at the origin. A necessary condition for the existence of three diﬀerent roots for f (s) is

In the case of astrophysical systems such as globular clusters, densities are quite low and the
temperatures are well beyond the ionization values. In this kind of systems acoustic waves may
appear if the wavenumber q is low enough.

In Figure 1, the blue line corresponds to the dispersion relation (Eq. (3)) for q = 10−10 1
m ,
CT = 102 m
seg and τr = 109seg. In this case CT qτr = 10 and no acoustic waves are present for this
mode. The red curve corresponds to the dispersion relation for the same values of CT and τr,
but with q = 10−13 1
m . In this case two complex roots appear, corresponding to acoustic waves
of very large wavelengths.

Figure 1: Dispertion relation for CT = 102 m/seg and τ = 109 seg. The blue curve corresponds to
q = 10−101/m (three real negative roots, no acoustic waves) and the red curve to q = 10−131/m
(one real negative root and acoustic waves),

4 Final Remarks

It is very hard to ﬁnd in the literature simple examples in which a discussion of the existence of
the roots precedes to the pursue of the solutions of the dispersion equation for dilute mixtures.
If dissipation is strong enough, it can prevent the formation of acoustic waves. In fact, the ideas
contained in this paper lead to the establishment of a cut-oﬀ wavelength that depends on the
isothermal speed of sound in the gas.

The extension of this criterion in the case of a single self-gravitating ﬂuid can be analyzed

through the dispersion relation [8] :

f (s) = s3 + (Dv + Dth)q2s2 −

It is interesting to notice that the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of three
diﬀerent real roots reduces to the inequality:

f (s+)f (s−) < 0,

[9], it is easily noticeable that

b(qJ ) ≃ −48πGρ0,

and no unstable modes appear at the ordinary critical wavelength.

We consider that this algebraic approach to the analysis of the Brillouin peaks for dilute

ﬂuids is promising and useful for students and researchers interested the subject.
