Abstract— Experiential learning (ExL) is the process of learning through experience or more speciﬁcally “learning through reﬂection on
doing”. In this paper, we propose a simulation of these experiences, in Augmented Reality (AR), addressing the problem of language
learning. Such systems provide an excellent setting to support “adaptive guidance”, in a digital form, within a real environment. Adaptive
guidance allows the instructions and learning content to be customised for the individual learner, thus creating a unique learning
experience. We developed an adaptive guidance AR system for language learning, we call Arigat ¯o (Augmented Reality Instructional
Guidance & Tailored Omniverse), which offers immediate assistance, resources speciﬁc to the learner’s needs, manipulation of these
resources, and relevant feedback. Considering guidance, we employ this prototype to investigate the effect of the amount of guidance
(ﬁxed vs. adaptive-amount) and the type of guidance (ﬁxed vs. adaptive-associations) on the engagement and consequently the
learning outcomes of language learning in an AR environment. The results for the amount of guidance show that compared to the
adaptive-amount, the ﬁxed-amount of guidance group scored better in the immediate and delayed (after 7 days) recall tests. However,
this group also invested a signiﬁcantly higher mental effort to complete the task. The results for the type of guidance show that the
adaptive-associations group outperforms the ﬁxed-associations group in the immediate, delayed (after 7 days) recall tests, and learning
efﬁciency. The adaptive-associations group also showed signiﬁcantly lower mental effort and spent less time to complete the task.

1 INTRODUCTION

Experiential learning (ExL) is a well-known learning approach used
in education, training, facilitation, coaching and organisational devel-
opment [28, 52, 57]. ExL refers to the process of learning through
experience or “learning by doing”. One of the most inﬂuential models
in ExL [57] is the Kolb’s learning model [50]. This model deﬁnes
ExL as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the trans-
formation of experience. Knowledge results from the combination
of grasping and transforming experience” [50]. The model is repre-
sented by four cyclical learning stages as seen in Fig. 2: (1) concrete
experience (feeling), (2) reﬂective observation (watching), (3) abstract
conceptualisation (thinking), and (4) active experimentation (doing).
One can enter the learning cycle at any stage, but all stages in the cycle
must be addressed for meaningful learning to occur.

In learning, including experiential learning, guidance is beneﬁcial.
The term guidance has a broad meaning, but we adopt the generally

understood deﬁnition of, guidance as “any form of assistance offered
to users so they can achieve a learning goal”. In more precise terms,
the role of guidance is “to simplify, provide a view on, elicit, supplant,
or prescribe the scientiﬁc reasoning skills” [55] involved in pursuing
a goal. It can be explicit, as when a teacher provides instructions on
how to solve a mathematical problem with all the in-depth explanations
of concepts and skills students need to learn, or provides feedback on
the current performance. Or it can be implicit, as it is provided within
the environment for users to ﬁnd, interpret and use in order to progress
in the task at hand [7, 16]. In either case the amount and the type of
guidance play an essential role in engagement and consequently, in the
learning outcomes [17, 44, 96].

While several educational deﬁnitions of guidance exist [5, 19, 55], in
the context of this study we focus on instructional “guidance”, which
is deﬁned as “providing users with accurate and complete procedural
information (and related declarative knowledge) that they have not
yet learned in a demonstration about how to perform the necessary
sequence of actions and make the necessary decisions to accomplish
a learning task” [19]. Guidance also has different dimensions such as
“how much” (amount) instructional support it provides [64, 95, 105],
and “what kind” (type) of support it provides [5]. Digital technologies
such as augmented reality (AR) appear ideal to support adaptation
of guidance. AR can provide an environment for simulating various
experiences by combining the physical environments with in-context

 
 
 
 
 
 
adaptive digital elements that can be manipulated by the user. AR can
thus replicate the real-world ExL scenario (e.g. learning by decorating
a room for Christmas celebrations with AR objects as can be done with
real objects) and show information in a coherent and meaningful way
within the real world context. Researchers have previously explored
AR systems as tools to guide or teach different skills and activities that
can be learned best through experience [37, 67]. Most of these projects
have primarily focused on creating simulated environments to support
different stages of the Kolb’s experiential learning cycle [12, 37, 67, 68,
97]. However, these projects explored generic guidance only, in which
all the users receive the same set of general instructional cues, with the
same amount, in the same way [12, 41, 60, 63, 101]. Therefore, there
are several questions that remain unanswered, such as: How to design
and implement guidance in learning environments where the learning
system needs to take over some or all of the tasks commonly conducted
by educators? How the adaptation of guidance (the amount and the type)
would affect the engagement and consequently the learning outcomes?
To this end, we built the Arigat¯o – an AR prototype, which aims
to effectively support learners to proceed through the ExL cycle fa-
cilitated by adaptive guidance. We deliberately selected AR as the
most probable future technology that will be used in the classroom
since it better supports real-world in-person communication and group
collaboration compared to a desktop, tablet, and VR [69, 80]. And
rather than comparing the AR to other technologies our goal was to
explore the design space of the AR. With the Arigat¯o prototype that
provides options for a ﬁxed and adaptive amount and type of guidance,
we aimed to answer the following research questions:

RQ1 How do the dynamic adaptations of AR guidance inﬂuence learn-
ers’ (RQ1a) recall of previously learned information, (RQ1b)
mental effort, (RQ1c) task completion time, and (RQ1d) instruc-
tional efﬁciency?

RQ2 How does learners’ engagement with AR content in terms of (i.e.,
task completion time, mental effort and motivation) affect their
performance (i.e., recall and efﬁciency)?

The focus on AR in language learning covers the exploration of XR
applications in the education and training domains making this study
strongly relevant to the ISMAR community.

2 RESEARCH BACKGROUND
We ﬁrst identify and analyse the relevant literature on experiential
learning, instructional guidance and in particular the amount and type
with a focus on language learning, user engagement, and language
learning in AR.

2.1 Experiential Learning
Experiential learning theory is based on the idea that learning is a pro-
cess of acquiring knowledge through experience or “learning through
reﬂection on doing” [50, 57]. Theoretical work on experiential learning
continues to evolve and several models as “theories-in-use” have been
proposed such as the Kolb’s model [50], Boud and Walker’s model [13],
Joplin’s ﬁve stage model [42], etc. Among these, the Kolb’s experiential
learning model is arguably the most inﬂuential model on educational
scholarship [57]. As shown in Fig. 2, the model describes experiential
learning as a four-part process, where the learner is asked to engage
in a new experience, actively reﬂect on that experience, conceptualise
it, and integrate it with prior experiences and knowledge. After com-
pleting this cycle, future decisions can be based on the newly acquired
concepts.

A range of prior work has explored the use of simulated environ-
ments and AR technology to support experiential learning [3, 12, 37, 40,
67,68,70,93,97,102]. Most of these approaches have primarily focused
only on the learning stages of the Kolb’s experiential learning cycle,
allowing learners to perform an action and providing feedback, which
learners could reﬂect on [12, 32, 37, 67, 68, 97]. However, according to
Kolb, the learner must continue cycling through all the four stages, thus
creating a “learning spiral of ever-increasing complexity” in order to

Fig. 2. Experiential learning cycle by Kolb [50]

gain a better learning outcome [51]. Currently, we are unaware of any
work that focuses on providing guidance to support learners move from
one stage to another in the experiential learning cycle and progress on
the learning spiral.

2.2 Instructional Guidance

In the past, the instructional support provided during learning has been
categorised and explained using different concepts and terms, such
as learning paradigms (e.g. behaviourism, cognitivism and construc-
tivism, etc.) [65, 95], instructional strategies (e.g. direct instructions,
indirect instructions, interactive instructions, etc.) [66, 103] and in-
structional methods (e.g. lectures, case studies, peer feedback, quizzes,
etc.) [22, 94]. Such paradigms, strategies and methods often emerge
from different learning theories, and sometimes various belief systems
and philosophies [22,35,64,65,105]. Therefore, when trying to employ
a construct, such as “instructional guidance”, we depend on the fact
that the use of different conceptual frameworks and theories tend to
deﬁne and operationalise instructional support in different ways. In the
following sections, we will focus on the amount and type of guidance
as described in the literature.

2.2.1 Amount of Guidance

Debates about the impact of instructional guidance and “how much”
instructional support needs to be provided in a learning environment
have been ongoing for at least the past century [47, 54, 64, 95]. For
example, is it better to instruct learners on what they need to know
by presenting them the essential information, or is it better to allow
learners to discover or construct essential knowledge for themselves?
Koedinger and Aleven called this issue the “assistance dilemma” [48],
i.e., deciding whether to provide or withhold assistance. The contrast
between the two practices can be better understood as a continuum. On
one side of this continuum is the hypothesis that people learn best in an
unguided or minimally guided environment [15, 90]. On the other side
is the hypothesis that learners should be given instructional guidance on
the concepts and procedures required for a particular task [22, 47, 64].
In a minimally guided learning environment, students are seen as
active learners and are given opportunities to digest content for them-
selves rather than as passive learners who merely follow instructions.
While these approaches have been adopted by some teachers and ed-
ucators [104], there have also been decades of efforts to discourage
educators from using minimally guided learning approaches. The past
half-century of empirical research on the topic has provided overwhelm-
ing and unambiguous evidence that minimal guidance during learning
is signiﬁcantly less effective and less efﬁcient compared to guided
learning [47]. The superiority of the latter is explained in the context
of human cognitive architecture and expert-novice differences [47].
Wise and O’Neill present a review of evidence to support the view that
the optimal amount of guidance is often somewhere in the middle of
the aforementioned continuum and that the granularity of the advice
provided in a task (i.e. the level of details) is equally important [105].

2.2.2 Type of Instruction
Research on memory and learning has shown that comprehension and
recall depend on different types of instructional methods and techniques
that can be used to process and store information [25]. The mnemonic
techniques have proven to be extremely effective in improving memory
and recall, especially in the area of foreign language learning [6, 20,
72, 76]. Mnemonic is an instructional strategy designed for enhancing
both memory and recall [62, 74, 75, 106]. This technique connects new
learning to prior knowledge through the use of visual and/or acoustic
cues. The basic types of mnemonic techniques rely on the use of key
words, rhyming words, or acronyms [62, 75].

In the ﬁeld of language learning, mnemonics have mostly been used
for vocabulary learning. Despite the great variety of techniques for
presenting mnemonic, the “keyword method” [11] for creating mental
associations to a known language has proven to be effective in the
memorisation of vocabulary. In the keyword method, learners associate
the sound of a word they want to learn to one they already know in
either their ﬁrst language or the target language. They then mentally
create an image of the known word to memorise the association [74].
This association based technique provides a powerful tool for words
that have a high degree of “imagenability” [79], or for word pairs
between which the learner can form some kind of semantic link [26].
The important aspect is that the keyword should clearly relate to the
thing being remembered. This method also motivates learners to be
more creative and use their minds more productively.

2.3 User Engagement
Engagement is a complex and multi-dimensional process [81, 83, 96]
intertwined with a learners’ internal indicators such as motivation, feel-
ings, etc. (affective dimension) [30], mental effort, perceptions, etc.
(cognitive dimension) [30], and observable actions such as performing
various activities, interacting with a system, etc. (behavioural dimen-
sion) [8, 30]. In addition, Reeve and Tseng suggested incorporating
agentic engagement as a fourth dimension of engagement [77]. Agentic
engagement refers to the proactive and intentional activity of the learner
to personalise the conditions of learning and to enrich external learning
goals.

Previous studies have shown that behavioural, cognitive and affec-
tive dimensions predict learner’ performance both separately and in
unison [4, 96]. This means that the dimensions of user engagement are
interrelated and simultaneously affect human behaviour [30].

Kearsley and Shneiderman have stressed that engagement can be
stimulated without technology, but digital technology opens up novel
possibilities that are hard to achieve in a physical form [46]. Accord-
ingly, research in this area has explored engagement with images [29],
video clips [2, 89], music [39, 49], and real-life scenarios [45, 99]. How-
ever, while there are a limited numbers of studies such as [33, 96], there
is a lack of research on learning and engagement in AR environments.

2.4 Language Learning in AR
A considerable body of literature focuses on guidance in AR environ-
ments to support learning in general [12, 60, 63, 93, 101] and language
learning in particular [9, 23, 24, 38, 87, 107]. Prior work on language
Learning in AR is summed in Table 1. We categorised it based on
the following dimensions: (i) Hardware used: mobile AR, HMD, sen-
sors; Learning focus: vocabulary and/or grammar; Guidance method:
generic or adaptive; and Learning method: experiential, contextual,
game-based learning, etc. [100]). Importantly, most of the existing ap-
proaches deliver generic guidance, in which all users receive the same
set of general instructional cues, and in the same way [12, 60, 63, 101].
However, as pointed out in Sect. 2.2, the amount and the type of
guidance play a vital role when providing instructional guidance. In
addition, the adaptation of guidance to user needs is also important
as noted in Sect. 2.2.1. Together they affect the engagement and con-
sequently the learning outcomes of each individual learner. While
there are studies such as [36, 93] that provide adaptive guidance for
performing a physical task, generally there is a lack of research on pro-
viding adaptive guidance based on the amount or type of instructions.
Moreover, we are unaware of any work that focuses on the “keyword

ments and how our work differs alongside different dimensions.

method” as the type of guidance used to support language learning in
AR environments.

In order to address these gaps, we developed an adaptive guidance
AR system for language learning called Arigat¯o. We employ this
prototype to investigate the effect of the amount (ﬁxed vs. adaptive)
and the type of associations (ﬁxed vs. adaptive) on the engagement
and consequently the learning outcomes of language learning in an AR
environment. The research method to investigate the aforementioned
effects is presented in the next section.

3 RESEARCH METHOD
The Arigat¯o prototype for language learning was developed to answer
our research questions. In this section, we present the prototype and
we describe the study conditions, study design, study procedure, partic-
ipants’ sampling, data collection, and analysis.

3.1 Study Conditions
The language selected for this study was Japanese, since it is unrelated
to the Indo-European family of languages and we expected people
would not be familiar with its grammar and vocabulary. We designed
four different study conditions based on two different aspects of in-
structional guidance that can be adapted: the AMOUNT of guidance
(FIXED-AMOUNT, which is the same for all, and ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT,
which decreases based on the learners’ performance), and the TYPE of
instructions, (FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS using predeﬁned 3D AR models
of the vocabulary being learnt and ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS using
self selected 3D AR models to create associations (“keyword method”)
to the vocabulary being learnt).

The structure of the design of the study with all four (4) study condi-
tions is illustrated in Fig. 3. The study was planned as a 2 x 2 mixed
design study (including both within and between-subjects) envisaged
to take approximately 60 to 75 minutes. A common within-subjects
design would make this cognitively demanding learning study even
longer (approx two to three hours), which might hinder participants’
performance and negatively affect the results. Other options such as
splitting the study into several sessions would also introduce other bi-
ases (e.g. users might study between sessions, day to day performance
might vary) and practical issues (e.g. getting all users back for the
following session).

The AMOUNT of guidance was thus evaluated as a within-subjects
variable while the TYPE of instructions as a between-subjects variable.

Fig. 3. Study design and conditions.

This means that each participant either received the FIXED-AMOUNT or
the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT of guidance, but all participants experienced
both FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS and ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS.

In each condition, participants had to learn Japanese vocabulary and
grammar around a particular topic (Christmas or birthday celebration)
by learning and understanding four (4) distinct phrases and their struc-
ture, and recall them successfully. The phrases related to Christmas
were: family gathering, Christmas tree preparation, turkey dinner and
lights decorations. The phrases related to birthday celebration were:
invite friends, blow balloons, bake a cake and light up candles.

In the FIXED-AMOUNT condition, at each stage of the learning cycle
participants received all the instruction for all the content needed to
be learnt for all four (4) phrases repeatedly through consequent cycles
until all phrases were correctly recalled. In the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT
condition, at each stage of the learning cycle participants only received
instructions for the phrases that were not recalled correctly in previous
cycles. Thus, once a phrase was recalled correctly in the CE stage,
the guidance for that phrase was not shown in the next cycles. In
the FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition, participants were presented with
predeﬁned 3D AR models of objects corresponding to vocabulary of
the phrases being learned. In the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS condition,
the participants could self-select 3D AR models to create associations
for the corresponding vocabulary of the phrases being learned.

To avoid the “order effects” (the inﬂuence of the order in which
the conditions are presented on participants’ performances [86]), the
order of TYPE of instructions (FIXED and ADAPTIVE) as well as the
order of the topic being learnt (Christmas and birthday celebration) was
balanced among the participants.

3.2 The Arigat ¯o Prototype

The prototype was developed for the Magic Leap one AR head mounted
display (HMD) with controller inputs 1, using the Unity3D game de-
velopment environment 2. The Lumin SDK 0.26 and Magic leap tools
were used for setting up the development environment with Lumin OS
0.98.3. The MRTK Mixed Reality tool kit 3 was used for integrating
the inputs and object manipulation techniques. Speech recognition was
implemented with the IBM Watson speech to text API 4.

The prototype replicates all four stages of Kolbs’ experiential cycle.
Before entering the cycle, the learner ﬁrst sees an introduction window
including all four (4) phrases related to the topic being learnt in English
in order to familiarise themselves with the intent and content of the
study. Besides text instructions and explanations, audio instructions
and explanations are also provided throughout the cycle.

The system starts the learning cycle in the abstract conceptualisation
(AC) stage. The AC stage provides the description of the vocabu-
lary and the basic grammar rules related to phrases being learnt. The

vocabulary is presented by either (i) FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS (for ex-
ample, for the word lights – “raito” in Japanese – a 3D virtual object
of a real world light set is shown by the word as visible in Fig. 1b),
or (ii) ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS (for example, for the word candle –
“rosoku” in Japanese – a merged 3D virtual object/a combined metaphor
of a rose inside a sock is shown by the word as visible in Fig. 1f). After
familiarising themselves with the content in the AC stage, the learner
proceeds to the active experimentation (AE) stage.

In the AE stage, the system shows each English phrase with a puzzle
task to generate the corresponding Japanese phrase made of three parts
from six (6) possibilities offered. The puzzle is also presented in two
ways based on the TYPE of instructions: (i) a word puzzle with text
components only (Fig. 1c) or (ii) a word puzzle together with 3D virtual
objects for the learner to create associations (Fig. 1e) from a given set
of objects. If the learner does not know the solution to the puzzle they
can skip that phrase. Feedback for the correct and incorrect phrases is
given as text and highlights as shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1e. There, if
the answer is incorrect, it highlights the given answer in red and shows
the correct answer separately.

After completing the puzzles related to all four phrases, the system
nudges the learner to proceed to the concrete experience stage (CE). A
3D avatar is shown asking the learner to recall each phrase in Japanese
(Fig. 1d) by speaking it aloud. To evaluate the spoken answers, the
IBM Watson speech recognition was not accurate enough, so a Wizard
of Oz technique was used for the experiment. If the phrase is correctly
voiced, the corresponding 3D AR model is displayed. The learner
can manipulate the object and place it anywhere in the room as they
would be able to do it in a real-world experiential learning scenario
with physical objects.

If all the phrases are not recalled correctly in the CE stage, the
system automatically moves to the reﬂective observation (RO) stage.
There, the learner can ﬁrst go through all the phrases that include
corresponding visual models and audio pronunciation, and then recall
them by selecting the correct Japanese phrase (out of four phrases)
corresponding to the given English phrase (Fig. 1a and g). The system
then returns back to the AC stage.

In this way, the system nudges the learner to proceed further in the
experiential learning cycle and consequently on the learning spiral until
all four (4) phrases are recalled correctly in the CE stage. In the FIXED-
AMOUNT condition, all learners have to repeat all phrases in all stages
in each cycle in the same way. In the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT condition,
the learner has to go only through and repeat previously incorrectly
recalled phrases (in the CE stage) as the content related to previously
correctly recalled phrases is no longer shown.

One of the main features of the Arigat¯o prototype is the possibility to
move digital objects around the physical space as well as move various

elements of the interface (e.g. puzzle) in order to complete the tasks
given. It is this manipulation of the digital elements that can be brought
in the visual ﬁeld and removed that supports experiential learning or
learning by doing.

3.3 Participants

In total, 28 participants were recruited for the study by invitation in a
mailing list and web page as well as by snowball sampling. All were
students and staff members from our university whose ﬁrst language
is one of the Indo-European languages. None of the participants had
any prior knowledge in the Japanese language (identiﬁed via a short
competency test questionnaire). The between-subject experimental
sample comprised 14 participants in the FIXED-AMOUNT condition
with 6 (46%) females and 14 participants in the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT
condition with 8 (54%) females. All participants were between 18 to 31
years old (x = 25) and randomly assigned to one of the two conditions.
The study was approved by the local Research Ethics Board.

3.4 Procedure

Participants were ﬁrst given a consent form to sign, together with
the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) outlining the entire research
process, and were given an opportunity to ask any question related to
the study. They were also instructed that they could abandon the study
at any stage. Next, they were requested to ﬁll out the Questionnaire on
Current Motivation (QCM).

Before starting the actual task, they completed a ﬁve minute train-
ing session on a demo application to understand the interface and
the interaction with the system. Participants were then instructed to
complete a language learning task on one topic (Christmas or birth-
day celebration) in one condition (either FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS or
ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS) and the other topic in the other condi-
tion (see within-subject part of the Fig. 3). After ﬁnishing each topic,
participants ﬁlled out a mental effort questionnaire and a recall question-
naire (to assess their immediate recall) asking participants to remember
phrases they just tried learn. They were given a 5 minutes break in
between the topics.

In addition, at the end of the study, participants answered two stan-
dard questionnaires: a system usability (SUS) [56] and a user expe-
rience questionnaire (UEQ) [85]. They also ﬁlled out a short post-
questionnaire with demographic questions, questions about previous
experience with AR technology, and questions about their vision. The
whole experiment lasted from 60 to 75 minutes.

One week after the study, participants were again requested to answer
the same recall questionnaire (as just after ﬁnishing the study) to assess
their delayed recall.

3.5 Data Collection

In all conditions, the performance progression data and the time stamp
data were logged by the system as a part of behaviour engagement.
To measure the motivation, the short form of the Questionnaire on
Current Motivation (QCM) with 12 items/questions [31, 78] was used.
QCM measures anxiety, challenge, interest, and probability of success
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5
(“strongly agree”). Instead of focusing in individuals sub-dimensions
(i.e., anxiety, challenge, interest, and probability of success), we used
the mean score of the 12 items as an indicator of the overall motivation.
For measuring mental effort we used a standard 8-questions ques-
tionnaire from [43] that focuses on mental load for learning contexts.
To ensure comparability with other studies while maintaining coher-
ence with our tasks, we just changed the wording to reﬂect the task
at hand and better ﬁt our learning scenario. In addition, we added 5
questions relevant to our study (How much effort did you invest in
(i) memorising the words, (ii) understanding particles, (iii) recalling
the memorised words, (iv) building the sentences with puzzle blocks,
and in (v) speaking the sentences out loud?). All 13 questions were
answered on a nine-point scale. The mean scores of the 8 (MEQ8) and
the 5 (MEQ5) answers as well as the overall mean score (MEQ13) were
used as indicators for the mental effort.

The recall questionnaire (immediate and delayed) included Japanese
phrases the participants practised during the learning tasks (e.g., “How
do you say ‘invite friends’ in Japanese?”, “How do you say ‘family
gathering’ in Japanese?” with the result marked as either correct or
incorrect).

To measure the usability of the system, we used the System Usability
Scale (SUS) questionnaire [14] (10 questions answered on a ﬁve-point
Likert scale). The SUS scores were calculated with the standard SUS
analysis. For measuring the user experience, we used the short version
of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S) [84, 85] with eight
items/questions. The ﬁrst four represent pragmatic qualities (Perspicu-
ity, Efﬁciency and Dependability) and the last four hedonic qualities
(Stimulation and Novelty) [84]. The results are converted to a range
between -3 to 3.

To assess the reliability of motivation and mental effort question-
naires, we performed Cronbach’s alpha test. Estimated reliability for
each questionnaire (motivation Cronbach’s α = 0.71 and mental effort
α = 0.89) was acceptable for the research purposes [10]. For the recall
questionnaire, the reliability was measured using the Kuder-Richardson
20 test [53] because of the binary nature of the results (correct/incorrect).
The KR = 0.76 > 0.5 value indicates that the reliability of the recall
questionnaire was also acceptable.

3.6 Data Analysis

Each data set collected in the study was ﬁrst checked for normality
using the Shapiro–Wilk normality test [88].

The analysis was done in R studio, using “WRS2” R package. For
immediate recall, delayed recall, mental effort, task completion time
and learning efﬁciency, the statistical signiﬁcance was examined using
a mixed between-within subjects ANOVA on the 20% trimmed means–
“bwtrim” [61]. The main between-subjects effect (group comparisons),
the main within-subjects effect (e.g., due to repeated measurements),
and the interaction effect, were computed using the “sppba”, “sppbb”,
and “sppbi” functions respectively [61]. Statistical signiﬁcance for
motivation was examined using the Mann-Whitney U test [91].

The resulting p < 0.05 are reported as statistically signiﬁcant.
All boxplots use a 1.5xIQR (interquartile range) rule and Tukey’s
fences [92] for whiskers and identiﬁed outliers. Asterisk notation is
used in ﬁgures to visualise statistical signiﬁcance (ns: p > 0.05, *:
p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01 and ***: p < 0.001).

We also conducted a power analysis to check and validate the results
and ﬁndings of the study. We calculated the effect size (Cohen’s d) for
each data set collected [21], selected the minimum effect size (Cohen’s
d = 1.251) and estimated the statistical power (1
β = 0.8) of data to
check whether the type II error probability (β ) is within an acceptable
range for a given sample size (n = 14 per group) and a signiﬁcance
level (α = 0.05). The estimated power value 0.8 shows that with the
given sample size, we can have a 80% chance that we correctly reject
the null hypothesis with a signiﬁcance level 0.05.

−

Finally, we used a Pearson’s multiple correlation test [73] to ﬁnd out
whether there were any correlations between a learner’s mental effort,
task completion time, motivation and their performances (i.e., recall
and efﬁciency).

4 RESULTS

The results of the analysis based on the input from the 28 participants
who completed the study is presented here. Before dwelling further into
the effects of guidance on various measures we have checked whether
the motivation has had an effect on the study. The results show that the
motivation had no statistically signiﬁcant effect on the rest of the results
presented in this section (Mann-Witney U test, U(NFIXED-AMOUNT =
14, NADAPTIVE-AMOUNT = 14) = 90.20, p > 0.05).

The following sections present the effect of adaptive guidance
(amount and type) on learning performance (immediate and delayed
recall), mental effort, task completion time, and learning efﬁciency (im-
mediate and delayed). The last section presents correlations between
these measures.

4.1 The Effect of Guidance on Learning Performance

4.2 The Effect of Guidance on Mental Effort

Learning performance was measured with the recall questionnaires
right after the study (immediate) and after 7 days (delayed). The results
are presented in the following two sections.

4.1.1 Immediate recall

The effect of the adaptive guidance – i.e., the AMOUNT (FIXED and
ADAPTIVE) and TYPE (FIXED and ADAPTIVE) – on immediate recall
is shown in Fig. 5 (top left). The data summarised in Fig. 5 (bottom
left) is analysed using a mixed between-within subjects ANOVA on the
20% trimmed means [61].

The results in Fig. 5 (bottom left) show that the effects of the
AMOUNT and TYPE of guidance on immediate recall are statistically
signiﬁcant. The effect of the AMOUNT of guidance alone (df = 14.19,
p < 0.001) is signiﬁcant. Fig. 5 (top left) indicates that the immediate
recall in the FIXED-AMOUNT condition (x = 83.04%, SD = 16.44) is
signiﬁcantly better compared to the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT condition
(x = 66.7%, SD = 19.15).

Similarly, the effect of the TYPE on immediate recall (df = 17.88,
p < 0.001) is also signiﬁcant. Furthermore, Fig. 5 (top left) indicates
that the immediate recall in the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS condition
(x = 86.61%, SD = 11.57) is signiﬁcantly better compared to the FIXED-
ASSOCIATIONS condition (x = 62.5%, SD = 14.42). The interaction
effect of the AMOUNT and TYPE on the immediate recall (df = 17.88,
p > 0.05) is not statistically signiﬁcant.

4.1.2 Delayed recall

The effect of the adaptive guidance (AMOUNT and TYPE) on delayed
recall is shown in Fig. 5 (top centre). The data summarised in Fig. 5
(bottom centre) is analysed using a mixed between-within subjects
ANOVA on the 20% trimmed means [61].

The results show that the effects of the AMOUNT and TYPE of
guidance on delayed recall are statistically signiﬁcant. The effect
of the AMOUNT of guidance alone (df = 15.13, p < 0.01) is also
signiﬁcant. Fig. 5 (top centre) indicates that the delayed recall in
the FIXED-AMOUNT condition (x = 70.54%, SD = 23.20) is signiﬁ-
cantly better compared to ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT condition (x = 50.00%,
SD = 23.15).

The effect of the TYPE on the delayed recall (df = 17.68, p < 0.001)
is also signiﬁcant. Fig. 5 (top centre) indicates that the delayed recall
in the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATION condition (x = 73.21%, SD = 18.12)
is signiﬁcantly better compared to FIXED-ASSOCIATION condition
(x = 47.32%, SD = 20.24). The interaction effect of the AMOUNT and
TYPE on the delayed recall (df = 17.68, p > 0.05) is not signiﬁcant.

The effect of the adaptive guidance (AMOUNT and TYPE) on mental
effort is shown in Fig. 5 (top right). The data summarised in Fig. 5 (bot-
tom right) is analysed using a mixed between-within subjects ANOVA
on the 20% trimmed means [61].

The results show that the effects of the AMOUNT and TYPE of
guidance on mental effort are statistically signiﬁcant. The effect
of the AMOUNT of guidance alone (MEQ13 df = 17.47, p < 0.01;
MEQ08 df = 16.09, p < 0.01; MEQ05 df = 14.73, p < 0.01) is sig-
niﬁcant. Fig. 5 (top right) indicates that the overall mental effort in
the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT condition (x = 3.66%, SD = 1.06) is signif-
icantly lower compared to the FIXED-AMOUNT condition (x = 4.61,
SD = 0.98).

The effect of the TYPE alone is also signiﬁcant (MEQ13 df = 17.78,
p < 0.001; MEQ08 df = 12.58, p < 0.01; MEQ05 df = 17.73, p <
0.01). Fig. 5 (top right) indicates that the overall mental effort in
the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS condition (x = 3.39, SD = 0.63) is
signiﬁcantly lower compared to the FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition
(x = 4.88, SD = 0.73). The interaction effect of the AMOUNT and TYPE
on mental effort (MEQ13 df = 17.78, p > 0.05; MEQ08 df = 12.58,
p > 0.05; MEQ05 df = 17.73, p > 0.05) is not statistically signiﬁcant.

4.3 The Effect of Guidance on Task Completion Time

The results for the task completion time presented in Fig. 6 (bottom left)
are analysed using a mixed between-within subjects ANOVA on the
20% trimmed means. The results indicate that the AMOUNT of guidance
has no statistically signiﬁcant effect on the task completion time (df =
15.29, p > 0.05). It can thus not be concluded that participants in the
ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT condition completed the task faster compared to
participants in the FIXED-AMOUNT condition.

In contrast, the effect of the TYPE on the task completion time is sig-
niﬁcant (df = 17.88, p < 0.001) as can be also observed in Fig. 6 (top
left). This also shows that the task completion time in the ADAPTIVE-
ASSOCIATIONS condition (x = 15.78 min, SD = 3.17) is signiﬁcantly
lower compared to the FIXED-ASSOCIATION condition (x = 27.13 min,
SD = 6.69). The interaction effect of the AMOUNT and TYPE on the task
completion time is not statistically signiﬁcant (df = 17.88, p > 0.05).

4.4 The Effect of Guidance on Learning Efﬁciency

The learning efﬁciency for each study condition was determined using

Fig. 7. Left: Immediate recall learning efﬁciency. Right: Delayed recall learning efﬁciency.

E = Learning efﬁciency
zP = Average performance in Z-scores
zM = Average task difﬁculty in Z-scores

We measured the performance of each study condition based on
the recall scores participants obtained after completing the task for
that study condition. We estimated the difﬁculty of the task based
on the mental effort questionnaire for that study condition. We then
calculated the learning efﬁciency for each of the four conditions: (a)
FIXED-AMOUNT of guidance with FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS, (b) FIXED-
AMOUNT of guidance with ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS, (c) ADAPTIVE-
AMOUNT of guidance with FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS, and (d) ADAPTIVE-
AMOUNT of guidance with ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS using Formula 1.
This was done for both immediate recall (immediately after participants
had completed the task) and delayed recall (a week after participants
had completed the task).

4.4.1 Immediate Efﬁciency
The immediate recall learning efﬁciency results across the study con-
ditions are depicted in Fig. 7 (left). It shows that, for both FIXED-
AMOUNT and ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT, the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS

condition is more efﬁcient (i.e., has a higher efﬁciency value) compared
to the FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition.

The effects of the AMOUNT and TYPE of guidance, on immediate
recall learning efﬁciency are shown in Fig. 6 (top centre). The data is
analysed using a mixed between-within subjects ANOVA on the 20%
trimmed means (Fig. 6 (bottom centre)). There is no signiﬁcant effect
of the AMOUNT of guidance conditions on participants’ immediate
recall learning efﬁciency (df = 16.80, p = 0.460).

By contrast, the effect of the TYPE of instructions on immedi-
ate recall learning efﬁciency is statistically signiﬁcant (df = 16.80,
p < 0.001). Fig. 6 (top centre) indicates that the immediate recall
learning efﬁciency in the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS condition is sig-
niﬁcantly higher compared to the FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition.
The interaction effect of the AMOUNT and TYPE on the immediate
recall learning efﬁciency is not statistically signiﬁcant (df = 16.80,
p > 0.05).

4.4.2 Delayed Efﬁciency
The delayed recall learning efﬁciency results across the study conditions
are shown in Fig. 7 (right). The ﬁgure indicates that, for both FIXED-

condition.

The effects of the AMOUNT and TYPE of guidance on delayed recall

learning efﬁciency are illustrated in Fig. 6 (top right).

There is no signiﬁcant effect of the AMOUNT of guidance condition

on the delayed recall learning efﬁciency (df = 16.72, p = 0.460).

By contrast, the effect of the TYPE of instructions on the de-
layed recall learning efﬁciency is statistically signiﬁcant (df = 16.72,
p < 0.001). The results also show that the delayed recall learning
efﬁciency is signiﬁcantly higher for ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS com-
pared to FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition. No statistically signiﬁcant
interaction effect was found between conditions (df = 16.72, p > 0.05).

4.5 System Usability and User Experience
The average SUS score shows that the system usability is in an ac-
ceptable range (FIXED-AMOUNT = 82.3, ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT = 85.8;
SUS > 70). The results for UEQ show that pragmatic (FIXED-AMOUNT
= 1.54, ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT = 1.75) and hedonic qualities (FIXED-
AMOUNT = 2.33, ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT = 2.52), as well as overall user
experience (FIXED-AMOUNT = 1.93, ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT = 2.14) are
perceived as strongly positive in both conditions. In all cases we see
that the adaptive-amount has higher values.

4.6 Correlations between Measures
A Pearson multiple correlation test was applied to ﬁnd out whether or
not there were any correlations between the measures (recall, efﬁciency,
mental effort, task completion time). The results are presented in
Table 2.

The results for the FIXED-AMOUNT condition indicate that in both
FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS and ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS conditions, the
mental effort is negatively related to both immediate and delayed recall
as well as to both immediate and delayed efﬁciency. The task comple-
tion time measure does not show any relationship to other variables.
The correlations between immediate/delayed and recall/efﬁciency vari-
ables was expected since these measures are all related.

Similar results can be observed for ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT condition.
In both FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS and ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS con-
ditions, the mental effort is negatively related to both immediate and
delayed recall as well as to both immediate and delayed efﬁciency.
The task completion time does also not show any relationship to other
variables. While, as before, immediate/delayed and recall/efﬁciency
correlations are not surprising.

5 DISCUSSION
Arigat¯o was developed to compare how learners perform in learning a
new language, when presented with different adaptation factors of AR
based instructional guidance in an experiential learning environment.
The AR system was deliberately selected as the most probable future
technology that will be used in the classroom. An AR classroom has
several advantages over other types of digitised classrooms such as
taking the real world into consideration and consequently embedding
information directly into the user’s ﬁeld of view. These advantages
better support real-world in-person communication and group collabo-
ration compared to other technologies AR is often contrasted to, such
as desktop, tablet computers, and VR [69, 80].

By taking the real world into consideration, our prototype did not
just show content on the HMD, but allowed users to move and place
AR objects in their physical surroundings. With this functionality, AR
was used to replicate the real-world experiential learning scenario (e.g.,
learning by decorating a room for Christmas celebrations with AR
objects as can be done with real objects) and show information in a
coherent and meaningful way within the real world context.

Arigat¯o allowed us to vary (i) the AMOUNT of guidance, which is
either FIXED or an ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT (the amount changes based
on participants’ performance), and (ii) the TYPE of association, which
is either FIXED or with ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS (participants can
select associations by themselves from a predeﬁned set). We used a
2 × 2 mixed design to evaluate the study conditions, as explained in
Sect. 3.1. The AMOUNT of guidance was evaluated as a within-subjects
variable while the TYPE of instructions as a between-subjects variable.

In this paper, the impact of the guidance method was measured through
performance (i.e., recall and efﬁciency) and engagement (i.e., task
completion time, mental effort, and motivation).

We measured behavioural engagement for FIXED guidance and
ADAPTIVE guidance by observing how participants interacted with Ari-
gat¯o and how much time they spent in each condition. We could observe
participants being more interested in the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS
than the FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition, even though they completed
the task in less time. This was expected, since keyword methods have
been suggested as motivating learners to be more creative and to enjoy
using their minds more productively [79].

We measured cognitive engagement for all the study conditions by
analysing how much mental effort participants invested in completing
the task. We found that the mental effort with the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT
of guidance was signiﬁcantly lower compared to the FIXED-AMOUNT
of guidance. This is in line with the literature, as prior work has
shown that repeating the same information could increase the amount
of cognitive work and consequently the mental effort [82]. We fur-
ther identiﬁed that the mental effort in the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS
condition was lower than in FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS condition. Again,
this was somewhat expected, as the association method connects new
learning to prior knowledge through the use of visual and/or acoustic
cues [62, 75], which could lower the mental effort. However, we have
shown that in the context of language learning the AR environment can
support the creation of adaptive constructs not only in the form of the
keywords (the “keyword method” [11]) and mental associations, but
also in combination with 3D digital objects that users can manipulate
with. It is this combination that supports experiential learning through
manipulation of digital objects and that outperformed the traditional
“keyword method” in our study.

We measured learning performance through analysis of recall (im-
mediate recall after the study and delayed recall test 7 days after the
study) and learning efﬁciency. Interestingly, we found that compared to
the ADAPTIVE-AMOUNT of guidance, the FIXED-AMOUNT of guidance
group scored better in the immediate and delayed recall tests, although
they have invested a signiﬁcantly higher mental effort during the task.
In addition, we found that the ADAPTIVE-ASSOCIATIONS outperformed
the FIXED-ASSOCIATIONS group, in the immediate, delayed recall tests,
and learning efﬁciency, while investing a signiﬁcantly lower mental
effort and spending a less amount of time during the task. These ﬁnd-
ing suggest avenues for future work in archetypal user models, which
might allow users to slowly adapt pre-developed personal models from
a standard set of ideal users. What we would refer to as the “follow the
leader” learning approach.

We have also investigated how different variables are correlated
and how they could be combined in order to more accurately present
engagement and learning performances of the participants’ for each
study condition. This contrasts to the existing literature in learning
that often looks at these aspects individually. Our results show corre-
lations between mental effort and learning performances (both recall
and efﬁciency) in all conditions, which was to be expected since the
two are considered related. Interestingly, there were no correlations
found between task completion time and learning performance in any
condition. Again, these ﬁndings suggest potential future work in “trans-
fer motivation” between individual learners or between instructors and
learners.

6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The average age of participants in our study was 25 years, which
presents a possible age bias. Despite this, this age group is worth
studying as it is highly mobile, spending an extended period of time in
a foreign speaking country (for example, the EU Erasmus+ programme
alone funds more than half a million exchanges yearly [27]). As such,
this group could beneﬁt from an improved language learning system.
Nevertheless, the results cannot be generalised over the whole popu-
lation, and expanding the study to other age groups and exploring the
effect of age on the proposed learning system is an important future
direction.

Another bias is the self-selection bias because the participants who

opted-in are likely to be at ease when learning a new language. How-
ever, even if this study attracted only a particular group of language
learners, the results still show the beneﬁt of AR guidance with adaptive
associations that would most likely beneﬁt also other users in our stud-
ied age group. However, this needs to be further investigated. Using
questionnaires for measuring certain aspects such as motivation and
mental effort can result in social desirability bias as users could answer
them to please the researcher. However, we used well established ques-
tionnaires together with measurements that can hardly be affected by
such bias (i.e., recall and efﬁciency and task completion time).

The Arigat¯o prototype covers the ﬁrst three levels (categories) of
the Bloom’s taxonomy [1] only: Knowledge (remembering the words,
sentences), Comprehension (understanding the structure of sentences),
and Application (applying or speaking out the sentences). The expan-
sion to higher levels of the taxonomy (Analysis (analyse), Synthesis,
and Evaluation (evaluate), Creation) is also relevant and we aim to take
this into consideration in future implementations. In addition, we used
the task of learning vocabulary and other language constructs as a use-
case to explore the potential of AR in adaptive learning scenarios. In
future, this use-case should be expanded to other use-cases to conﬁrm
its generalisability.

7 CONCLUSION

In this paper we present the Arigat¯o (Augmented Reality Instructional
Guidance & Tailored Omniverse) prototype – an adaptive guidance
augmented reality (AR) system for language learning. AR has been
identiﬁed as an ideal platform to support simulating various experiences
for experiential learning and we explored the AR’s design space in
the learning context rather than comparing it to other technologies.
With our prototype we investigated how the amount of guidance (ﬁxed
vs. adaptive-amount) and the type of guidance (ﬁxed vs. adaptive-
associations) affects the engagement and consequently the learning
outcomes of language learning in an AR environment.

Compared to the adaptive-amount, the ﬁxed-amount of guidance
group scored better in the immediate and delayed (after 7 days) recall
tests. However, this group also invested a signiﬁcantly higher mental
effort to complete the task. Adaptive-associations group outperformed
the ﬁxed-associations group in the immediate, delayed (after 7 days)
recall tests, and learning efﬁciency. The adaptive-associations group
also showed signiﬁcantly lower mental effort and spent less time to
complete the task. Both results hint at potential for the archetypal user
models in comparable learning scenarios, which might allow users to

“transfer motivation” between individual learners or between instructors
and learners, and slowly adapt pre-developed personal models. Such
approach could achieve the balance between the (adaptive) amount
and (adaptive) type to optimise the mental effort need to complete the
learning task.

The results also show the potential of AR in adaptive learning sce-
narios where the learning environment needs to be simulated and where
virtual content needs to be added or removed on the ﬂy based on the
learning needs. Learning vocabulary and other language constructs as a
use-case explored in this study, presents just one of many possibilities
that offer venues for future work in AR classrooms as it is likely that
the technology will get better and widely accessible in the future [58].
