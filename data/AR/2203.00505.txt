Crossed Andreev reﬂection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon in a system of two normal
metal (NM) leads connected to a superconductor (SC) that converts the electron like excitations in
one metallic lead into hole like excitations in the other metallic lead. The scattering phenomena
viz. electron tunneling (ET), electron reﬂection (ER) and Andreev reﬂection (AR) compete with
CAR and reduce the probability of CAR generically. One of the experimentally realized proposals
to observe CAR is to employ two ferromagnetic (FM) leads in antiparallel conﬁguration connected
to the SC by suppressing ET and AR. But CAR probability cannot be tuned in this setup. We
propose a setup consisting of a gate tunable NM region connected to two superconducting regions
on either side which are connected to FM leads further away in antiparallel conﬁguration, in which
probabilities of CAR and ER can be changed from 0 to 1 by a changing the gate voltage applied to
the NM region. The gate voltage applied to the NM region dictates the chemical potential of the
NM region and gives a handle on the Fabry-P´erot interference of the electron and hole modes in the
NM region. We calculate diﬀerential transconductance for the proposed setup which can be tuned
across the range 0 to −e2/h.

INTRODUCTION

Crossed Andreev reﬂection (CAR) is a nonlocal trans-
port phenomenon that happens in a system of two normal
metal (NM) leads connected to a superconductor (SC)
where an electron current driven in one NM lead re-
sults in a hole current exiting through the other NM
lead1–19. This phenomenon is useful for many reasons,
one being the production of nonlocally entangled elec-
trons20–23, another as a probe for nonlocality of Majo-
rana fermions24–30. CAR in a system of two NM leads
connected to a SC is accompanied by other competing
processes where the electron current driven in one NM
lead results in :(i) an electron current exiting the same
NM lead, (ii) a hole current exiting the same NM lead,
or (iii) an electron current exiting the other NM lead;
these phenomena are called electron reﬂection (ER), An-
dreev reﬂection (AR) and electron tunneling (ET) respec-
tively. Current due to ET in the second NM is typically
much larger than the current due to CAR, in addition
to the two currents being opposite in sign and this hin-
ders the observation of CAR2,18. Hence, enhancement of
CAR over ET is essential for CAR to be observed. Of
many proposals to enhance CAR over other competing
processes1–3,17,18, two schemes have been realized exper-
imentally so far. In one scheme, two ferromagnets in an-
tiparallel conﬁguration have been connected to the SC7,8,
while in the other scheme, barriers have been employed at
the NM-SC interfaces9. However, the strength of CAR
current is not tunable in these experiments. A control
over the magnitude of CAR enables us to enhance this
scattering phenomenon by tuning the relevant parameter
in the setup.

Fabry-P´erot interference on the other hand is a phe-
nomenon that has played an important role in electron
transport31. This is essentially an interference between
waves reﬂected multiple times in a ballistic channel be-

tween two partially transparent interfaces. Fractional
charges in quantum Hall systems have been detected us-
ing this phenomenon32. Oscillations in transverse con-
ductance in the study of planar Hall eﬀect are due to this
phenomenon33,34. Conductance oscillations in proposed
spin transistors based on edge states of quantum spin
Hall insulators have been interpreted with the help of this
phenomenon35. One of the schemes to enhance CAR is
based on Fabry-P´erot interference between Bogoliubov-
de Genes quasiparticles formed in superconducting lad-
der18,19. By applying bias across both the NM-SC junc-
tions, relative contributions from CAR and ET can be
tuned by changing the two bias voltages when the SC
region also has spin orbit coupling36.

We propose a setup to enhance CAR by Fabry-P´erot
interference between electron and hole states of a gate
tunable NM region connected to superconductors on ei-
ther side which are connected to ferromagnetic leads fur-
ther away in antiparallel conﬁguration as depicted in
Fig. 1. In our setup, the ferromagnetic leads in antipar-
allel conﬁguration are fully spin polarized and hence AR
and ET are completely suppressed. The superconductor
is an s-wave superconductor which mixes electron and
hole excitations in opposite spin channels. Hence, an
electron incident from left FM lead either gets reﬂected
as an electron in left FM lead (ER) or gets transmitted as
a hole in right FM lead (CAR). Whether CAR dominates
ER or the other way is decided by the interference among
the electron and hole excitations in the middle NM region
which can be tuned by an applied gate voltage.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we

and understand the results obtained. In section IV, we
discuss possible experimental realization of the proposed
setup, future directions and conclude.

FIG. 1. (a) A schematic of the proposed setup. Two ferromagnetic leads (FM) in antiparallel conﬁguration placed at the two
extreme ends are connected to the central gate tunable normal metal (NM) region via superconductors (SCs). Both the FMs
are fully spin polarized. A bias voltage V is applied between the left FM and the right FM, and the currents are measured in
both the leads. An electron (e) incident from the left FM either gets reﬂected as an e in the left FM or gets transmitted as a
hole (h) into the right FM. (b) An illustration of prominent scattering processes that interfere and result in crossed Andreev
reﬂection. In both processes illustrated here, an incident electron from left FM exits as a hole in the right FM. In the central
NM region, it traverses as an electron in one of the processes and as a hole in the other process as shown. In the SC regions,
the excitation travels as a BdG quasiparticle (B).

space. On the left FM (in the region n ≤ −NS − 1), the
dispersion relations for up/down-spin electrons is E =
(−2t cos ka − µ ∓ M ) while the dispersion for up/down
spin holes is E = (2t cos ka+µ∓M ), where a is the spac-
ing between neighboring lattice points. If (−V0, V0) is the
bias window in which transport is studied, for −2t < µ <
0 and V0 + 2t + µ < M < 2t − µ − V0, only up spin bands
for electron and hole fall in the range of bias window in
the left FM. The dispersions for right FM are the same
except for the change M → −M due to antiparallel con-
ﬁguration. In the bias window, there are only down spin
bands for electrons and holes. The dispersion in the two
SC regions is E = ±(cid:112)(2t cos ka + µ)2 + ∆2. The disper-
sion in the central NM region is E = ∓(2t cos ka + µ0)
for electron/hole bands of both the spins. The fact that
chemical potentials of the superconductors do not change
with time implies that the superconductors are grounded.

An electron incident on the superconductor can get
scattered either as an electron of same spin or a hole of
opposite spin. There is no term in the Hamiltonian that
mixes the spins. So, the wavefunction for an electron
incident from the left FM lead has only two components
that are nonzero: the up spin electron and the down spin

M )/2t]. While the eigenmodes in the FM and NM re-
gions are either purely electron-like or purely hole-like,
the eigenmodes in the SC region are the BdG quasiparti-
cle modes which have both electron and hole components
dictated by the spinor [u, vj]T . When |E| < ∆, the BdG
quasiparticle modes are equally electron-like and hole-
like since |u|2 = |vj|2. When |E| > ∆, j = 1, 2 corre-
spond to electron-like excitations while j = 3, 4 corre-
spond to hole-like excitations. Further, k1 = −k2 and
k3 = −k4 which imply that kj’s come in pairs with
one left-moving mode j and one right-moving mode j(cid:48)
such that kj(cid:48) = −kj. The scattering coeﬃcients re, rh,
sL,j’s, s0es’s, s0hs’s, sR,j’s, te and th have to be deter-
mined from Schr¨odinger wave equation for the Hamil-
tonian eq. (1). Typically, for scattering problems in a
continuum, boundary conditions need to be speciﬁed at
the interfaces18,37,38. However, the system has been de-
scribed by a lattice model in this work and the boundary
conditions are encoded within the Hamiltonian eq. (1).
The Hamiltonian used in this work corresponds to highly
transparent barriers at the interfaces37. The reﬂected
hole and the transmitted electron modes are evanes-
cent waves in the two FMs since there are no bands
for these modes in the bias window. Two prominent
scattering processes that contribute to CAR are illus-
trated in Fig. 1(b). The amplitudes for ER and CAR-
re and th must satisfy: |re|2 + |th|2 sin kha/ sin kea = 1,
which follows from conservation of probability current.
The diﬀerential transconductance GRL which is the ra-
tio of inﬁnitesimal change of current in the right FM
lead to the inﬁnitesimal change in voltage bias applied
to the left FM lead at voltage bias V = E/e is given by
GRL = −|th|2(e2/h) sin kha/ sin kea, where e is electron
charge. Since the two SC regions are grounded, currents
ﬂow into the drains at the two SC’s and are carried by

Cooper pairs into the SCs. The steady state currents in
the two FM leads and the NM region are not equal when
a bias is applied. From the probability conservation, it
can be shown that the local conductance at the left FM
lead GLL (deﬁned as the ratio of inﬁnitesimal change of
current in the left FM lead to the inﬁnitesimal change in
voltage bias applied to the left FM lead at voltage bias
V = E/e) and the transconductance GRL are related by
GRL = −GLL.

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

We set µ = −1.9t so that the Fermi energy is near the
band bottom. The superconducting pairing ∆ is typ-
ically much smaller than the diﬀerence between Fermi
energy and the band bottom which is 0.1t.
So, we
choose ∆ = 0.02t. The Zeeman energy characterizing
the ferromagnetic lead is chosen to be M = 0.3t so that
band of only one spin exists in the range of bias win-
dow (−2∆, 2∆). (N0 + 1) = 61 sites are chosen in the
central N M region. The transconductance is negative
since only holes get transmitted into the right FM in re-
sponse to electrons incident from the left FM. We plot
a contour plot of magnitude of transconductance as a
function of chemical potential of the central region µ0
and the voltage bias V in Fig. 2 for an optimal choice
of number of superconducting sites NS = 10. We ﬁnd
that |GRL| oscillates as µ0 is varied and at certain val-
ues of µ0 and bias V , it attains the maximum value of
e2/h.
In Fig. 2, at zero bias, we ﬁnd a series of val-
ues of µ0,i at which |GRL| peaks. This is a feature of
Fabry-P´erot interference. To quantitatively uphold this
i = 1, 2, .., we ﬁnd the
explanation, at each value of µ0,i,
wavenumbers for electron and hole excitations in the cen-
tral NM region: ke0,i = kh0,i = cos−1[−µ0,i/2t]. These
wavenumbers satisfy the Fabry-P´erot interference condi-

in the range of 10 ≤ NS ≤ 30, where it is peaked is
plotted in Fig. 4 (b). It can be seen from this ﬁgure that
CAR is maximally enhanced for some special choice of
length of the SC region: NS = 17. However the value of
transconductance is highly sensitive to the choice of NS.
In an experimental system, the length of the SC region
may not be precisely the one for which CAR is maximally
enhanced and once the heterostructure is fabricated, the
length of the SC region cannot be changed.

To compare the sensitivity of GRL for the proposed
FM-SC-NM-SC-FM system, we plot the magnitude of
transconductance for this system at zero bias versus µ0
and NS in Fig. 5. It can be seen from this ﬁgure that the
value of GRL is tunable to maximal value close to e2/h by
changing µ0 for a range of lengths of SC: 5 < NS < 13.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have proposed a scheme where CAR can be tuned
and enhanced. The proposed scheme encompasses a
gate tunable normal metal region connected to FM leads
through SC regions. Spin orbit coupling in the system
induces spin ﬂip scatterings and the incident up spin elec-
tron can get transmitted as a down spin electron in the
proposed setup adding another scattering phenomenon

1)a = π conﬁrming that the oscillation in the transcon-
ductance is due to interference among electron and hole
modes in the NM region.

We now turn to the conductance spectrum for lengths

and much larger than the optimal length.
we plot the magnitude of transconductance versus µ0
and bias V for (a) NS = 4 and (b) NS = 30. For
very short SC regions, the CAR probability is small2,18
and hence the regions with enhanced CAR are narrow.
Further, in the SC Hamiltonian, the magnitude of the
term ∆ that mixes the electron-like and hole-like parti-
cles is relatively larger than the magnitude of the term
(2t cos ka + µ) that corresponds to the pure NM close to
zero bias. While the term in the Hamiltonian propor-
tional to ∆ converts an electron into hole, the term t
makes an electron at one site hop on to the neighboring
site as an electron. Hence, CAR probability is enhanced
near zero bias for small values of NS. However, there is a
competing mechanism which takes over at large lengths
of the SC region. Within the SC gap the wavenumbers
kj in the SC regions are complex and the corresponding
decay lengths are larger close to zero bias making trans-
mission through the SC region harder close to zero bias.
This can be seen from earlier works on transport across
SC where both ET and CAR are suppressed close to zero
bias for large lengths of the SC region2,18. Suppression
of CAR close to zero bias when NS is large is rooted
in this mechanism. This explains the contrasting behav-
iors of the transconductance at large and small lengths of
the SC. The optimal length NS0 (cid:39) [|Im[π/(k∆a)|], where
k∆a = cos−1{−(µ + i∆)/2t} is the wavenumber of one of
the SC modes at zero energy and [x] is the integer part of
the real number x. For the values of parameters chosen
for Fig. 2, the optimal length of the SC: NS0 ∼ 10.

To get an idea of enhancement of CAR in this scheme
compared to FM-SC-FM heterostructures, we calculate
GRL for an FM-SC-FM system with the SC region having
NS sites. The Hamiltonian is the same as in eq. (1),
except that the central N M region is absent and the SC
region has totally NS sites. The magnitude of diﬀerential
transconductance |GRL| is plotted as a function of NS
and bias in Fig. 4 (a) for the same choice of parameters
as earlier. The magnitude of zero bias transconductance

that competes with CAR. Hence, an ideal candidate for
the NM region should have negligible spin orbit interac-
tion. Experimentally, chemical potential can be tuned
by an applied gate voltage in graphene39,40 -a material
with negligible spin orbit interaction making it an ideal
candidate for NM region. A few candidates for fully spin
42
polarized ferromagnets such as perovskites41 and CrO2
exist, in addition to ferromagnets like iron in which a
substantial spin polarization can be induced by an ap-
plied magnetic ﬁeld. AR has been observed in junctions
43,44, making NbSe2 a possible
of graphene with NbSe2
choice for SC in the proposed setup.

CAR is enhanced maximally in certain regions of the
parameter space. Such regions of maximally enhanced
CAR are substantially large for a range of length of
the SC region which is determined by the SC pairing
strength, the chemical potential of the SC region and the
hopping strength. The probabilities for CAR and ER can
be tuned by an applied gate voltage which changes the
chemical potential of the NM region in the setup. The
Fabry-P´erot interference condition: (ke0,i+1 −ke0,i)(N0 +
1) = π implies the spacing between consecutive values of
µ0 at which CAR probability is maximum gets smaller as
the number of NM sites N0 increases. For small values
of N0, µ0 has to be changed substantially to alter the
CAR probability by a considerable amount whereas for
large N0 even a tiny change in µ0 aﬀects the interference
resulting in ample variation of CAR probability. Hence,
a choice of N0 neither too small nor too large makes the

tunability of CAR practically possible.

Eﬀects such as Coulomb blockade and inelastic scat-
tering can be important in heterostructures considered45.
Coulomb blockade is a phenomenon that originates from
electron electron interaction in the NM region of such a
setup. By choosing a large capacitance for the gate elec-
trode coupled to the NM region, the eﬀects of Coulomb
blockade can be suppressed46.
Inelastic scattering at
NM-SC junctions has explained Andreev reﬂection fea-
tures in certain systems with the help of a formalism
which uses Dynes parameter47–49. However, this formal-
ism cannot be extended to nonlocal transport across a
superconductor to get physically meaningful results. Fur-
ther, the phenomenon of CAR observed in a number of
experiments7–9,50 has been satisfactorily explained using
the scattering formalism employed in this work without
taking into account inelastic scattering. Developing a
formalism to study nonlocal transport across a super-
conductor taking inelastic relaxation into consideration
is a promising future direction. We believe our proposal
can be realized with the present technology by suitably
fabricated heterostructures.
