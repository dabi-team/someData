ABSTRACT
Three-dimensional (3-D) scene reconstruction is one of the key
techniques in Augmented Reality (AR), which is related to the
integration of image processing and display systems of complex
information. Stereo matching is a computer vision based approach
for 3-D scene reconstruction.
In this paper, we explore an im-
proved stereo matching network, SLED-Net, in which a Single
Long Encoder-Decoder is proposed to replace the stacked hour-
glass network in PSM-Net for better contextual information learning.
We compare SLED-Net to state-of-the-art methods recently pub-
lished, and demonstrate its superior performance on Scene Flow and
KITTI2015 test sets.

1 INTRODUCTION
3-D scene reconstruction is one of the most critical techniques in AR,
which has been developed with substantial effort and can be con-
ducted by either traditional surveying or novel 3-D modeling systems.
Traditional remotely sensed reconstruction techniques include two
major methods, i.e., airborne image photogrammetry and LiDAR
(Light Detection And Ranging), but these techniques suffer from
such problems as time consuming, high ﬁnancial and equipment
costs, difﬁculty of cloud point processing, and so on. To overcome
the disadvantages of traditional methods, stereo matching has been
introduced into 3-D modeling systems in recent years. PSM-Net [1]
is one of the state-of-the-art stereo matching methods, and contains
stacked hourglass networks for cost volume regularization. However,
such networks pay less attention to the local appearance and are thus
not suitable for stereo matching. In this paper, we propose a Single
Long Encoder-Decoder network (SLED-Net) to replace the stacked
hourglass network used in PSM-Net [1]. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our new module in stereo matching.

2 SINGLE LONG ENCODER-DECODER
The full framework of SLED-Net is illustrated in Fig. 2. We design
a Single Long Encoder-Decoder (SLED, with light orange color) to
replace the stacked hourglass networks in PSM-Net [1]. The SLED
is set up as follows: Encoder: Convolutional and average pooling
layers are alternatively stacked to process the feature maps down to
a resolution with 1
4 × scale. In details, as

shown in Fig. 2, the encoder totally consists of eight residual blocks,
and in each block an element-wise sum is applied to fuse the features
generated by a convolution operation and the features generated by
the previous block, and then the fused features are feed into the sub-
sequent block. Decoder: After reaching the lowest resolution, the
network begins the top-down sequence of upsampling and combina-
tion of features across different scales. To bring together information
across two adjacent resolutions, we upsample the features with lower
resolution by trilinear interpolation. Then, we adopt an element-wise
sum to combine the upsampled features and the larger features from
the encoder with skip layers, and an operation closely following sum
operation to fuse the combined features through a residual block
which contains a 3 × 3 atrous convolution with dilation of 2.

To enhance the performance of SLED-Net, the initial cost volume

is used as an intermediate supervision [3].

3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Datasets We adopt two publicly available datasets for training

and testing: The Scene Flow datasets and KITTI2015 dataset

Training The training of SLED-Net follows the process de-
scribed in PSM-Net [1]. We implement SLED-Net using PyTorch

and conduct experiments on four NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPUs. We
ﬁrst train SLED-Net on Scene Flow datasets with a ﬁxed learn-
ing rate of 0.001 for 20 epochs, then we ﬁne-tune the network on
KITTI2015 dataset with stepped learning rates of 0.001 for 600
epochs and 0.0001 for another 400 epochs.

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We compare SLED-Net with three state-of-the-art approaches. The
evaluation results on the Scene Flow test set and KITTI2015 test
set are summarized in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, respectively. SLED-Net
achieves the superior performance on both two datasets. Compared
with PSM-Net [1], although the number of parameters in SLED-Net
reduces by 0.36M, SLED-Net surpasses PSM-Net by 35.9% in terms
of end-point-error on Scene Flow dataset, and by 3.9% in terms of
the overall three-pixel-error on KITTI 2015 dataset, respectively.
We display some examples from KITTI2015 dataset in Fig. 1.

5 ABLATION STUDY

To explore the reasons why SLED is better than stacked hourglass
networks in stereo matching, we design some ablation studies: 1)
We compare PSM-Net [1] with a single hourglass network (1HG) to
a baseline network with four Simply Cascaded Convolution layers
(SCC-Net). In details, the encoder of the single hourglass network in
1HG contains four 3 × 3 convolutional layers with stride of 2, SCC-
Net is generated through replacing the single hourglass network in
1HG with a plain network consisting of four 3 × 3 convolution layers
with stride of 1. As shown in Tab. 3, the performance has 26.2%
increase in Scene Flow test set and 6.9% increase in KITTI2015 test
set when using a single encoder-decoder network but with approxi-
mately the same number of layers and parameters. 2) We conduct
experiments to demonstrate the stacked design by increasing the
stacked number of hourglass network from 1 to 3, which corre-
sponds to 1HG, 2HGs, and 3HGs in Tab. 3. During the training the
weights of all loss functions are set to 1, which is different from such
setting in PSM-Net [1]. Results show that the pixel-wise estimation
can be better reﬁned with the number of staked hourglass networks
increasing. 3) We explore whether SLED is better than the stacked

design (3 HGs) in stereo matching or not. As shown in Tab. 3,
compared with 3HGs, the performance of SLED-Net has 11.2%
increase in Scene Flow test set and 1.5% increase in KITTI2015 test
set, which demonstrates that the change in network architecture does
play the core role, and the stacked hourglass network in PSM-Net [1]
limits the ability of the regularization for cost volume.

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present a single long encoder-decoder to replace
the stacked hourglass networks in PSM-Net [1] when regularizing
the cost volume in stereo matching. The cost volume is encoded by
several simply cascaded convolutional and pooling layers and then
decoded by consecutive trilinear interpolation and 1 × 1 convolution
operations to reﬁne the features with low resolutions. The experi-
mental results show that SLED-Net achieves superior performance
on both Scene Flow datasets and KITTI2015 benchmark, which
has been demonstrated that SLED is better than stacked design,
and SLED-Net enables to provide accurate results for 3-D scene
reconstruction in AR.
