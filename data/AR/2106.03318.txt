ABSTRACT

Active regions are thought to be one contributor to the slow solar wind. Upﬂows in EUV coronal spectral lines
are routinely osberved at their boundaries, and provide the most direct way for upﬂowing material to escape into
the heliosphere. The mechanisms that form and drive these upﬂows, however, remain to be fully characterised.
It is unclear how quickly they form, or how long they exist during their lifetimes. They could be initiated low
in the atmosphere during magnetic ﬂux emergence, or as a response to processes occuring high in the corona
when the active region is fully developed. On 2019, March 31, a simple bipolar active region (AR 12737)
emerged and upﬂows developed on each side. We used observations from Hinode, SDO, IRIS, and Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) to investigate the formation and development of the upﬂows from the eastern side. We used the
spectroscopic data to detect the upﬂow, and then used the imaging data to try to trace its signature back to earlier
in the active region emergence phase. We ﬁnd that the upﬂow forms quickly, low down in the atmosphere, and
that its initiation appears associated with a small ﬁeld-opening eruption and the onset of a radio noise storm
detected by PSP. We also conﬁrmed that the upﬂows existed for the vast majority of the time the active region
was observed. These results suggest that the contribution to the solar wind occurs even when the region is small,
and continues for most of its lifetime.

1. INTRODUCTION

Outﬂows from the edges of active regions have become a
focus of many studies since they were noted in early obser-
vations from Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007). These outﬂows
are of great interest because of their likely contribution to
the slow solar wind (Sakao et al. 2007; Harra et al. 2008;
Doschek et al. 2008). Upﬂows in active regions are most ob-
vious in hot spectral lines formed around 1–2 MK (Del Zanna
2008; Warren et al. 2011), and occur in dark areas where the
line intensities are faint, especially at the active region edges
(Doschek et al. 2008). They show bulk plasma motions on
the order of tens of km s−1 (Del Zanna 2008). A higher
speed component, reaching hundreds of km s−1, is also of-
ten present in the blue wing of EUV spectral lines (Bryans
et al. 2010; Peter 2010; Tian et al. 2011; Brooks & Warren
2012). Plasma composition measurements and simple mass
ﬂux estimates have strengthened the idea of a connection to

the slow solar wind (Brooks & Warren 2011; Brooks et al.
2015; Brooks & Yardley 2021). Indeed different composi-
tion signatures in the outﬂows may help explain variability
in the slow wind (Brooks et al. 2020), and the evolution of
the upﬂows has even been linked to radio noise storms de-
tected close-in to the Sun by Parker Solar Probe (Harra et al.
2021).

Linking remote sensing and in-situ observations is a key
goal of both Parker Solar Probe (PSP, Fox et al. 2016) and
Solar Orbiter (M¨uller et al. 2020). Detailed recent reviews
focusing on active region outﬂows are given by Hinode Re-
view Team et al. (2019) and Tian et al. (2021), while an ex-
tensive review including their contribution to the solar wind
was presented by Abbo et al. (2016).

There remain several outstanding issues with our under-
standing of the upﬂows/outﬂows, and these have signiﬁcant
implications for their contribution to the slow solar wind. In
particular, it is not clear how early they form in the emer-

gence phase of an active region, nor how long they persist
during its lifetime. Do upﬂows become outﬂows and con-
tribute to the slow wind all the time they exist, or just for a
shorter fraction of the active region lifetime? Clearly active
regions are a more signiﬁcant contributor to the slow wind if
1) the upﬂows exist longer, and 2) even small regions have
upﬂows.

One of the difﬁculties in studying the early formation
phase is that the spectroscopic instruments used to measure
plasma ﬂows around active regions have small ﬁelds-of-view
(FOV) and slow slit scanning times. This makes it challeng-
ing to catch active regions as, or soon after, they emerge.
Harra et al. (2010) present observations of emerging ﬂux
within an already developed active region that was observed
by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS, Culhane et al. 2007)
on Hinode. The interaction between newly emerging and
pre-existing opposite polarity magnetic ﬁeld formed a ring of
strong upﬂows at the active region edge. This formed quickly
- within 12 hours - but we should note that the magnetic topo-
logical conditions were very favourable since large scale up-
ﬂows were already present in the overlying developed active
region. These may already have opened the ﬁeld surrounding
the active region. It is unclear if upﬂows form as quickly in
an isolated active region.

These ideas are closely connected with the upﬂow forma-
tion mechanism itself, which is another unresolved issue.
Perhaps the most popular picture is that closed ﬁeld loops in
the active region core are opened by interchange reconnec-
tion with the open ﬁelds in its surroundings. This can occur
at quasi-separatrix layers (Baker et al. 2009; Mandrini et al.
2015), where there are strong gradients in magnetic connec-
tivity, and may be driven by the active region emergence and
expansion (Murray et al. 2010; Del Zanna et al. 2011). This
process provides a mechanism to transfer the closed (solar
wind-like) composition of the hot core loops onto open mag-
netic ﬁelds.

Again, a key question is when and where? If emergence
is the driver, this could happen quickly and low down in the
atmosphere. Conversely, it could be that even after upﬂow

formation, the parent active region needs to expand and in-
teract with high lying magnetic ﬁeld before the upﬂow opens
to the heliosphere. Some studies have shown that the up-
ﬂow magnetic ﬁeld is not always open (Edwards et al. 2016),
while others suggest that some fraction of the upﬂow mass
ﬂux also ﬂows through connections to distant active regions
Boutry et al. (2012).

Another possibility is the direct injection of mass and en-
ergy into the upﬂows by chromospheric jets (De Pontieu et al.
2009). Recently Polito et al. (2020) found signatures of the
upﬂows in chromospheric spectral lines observed by the In-
terface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS, De Pontieu et al.
2014). Several chromospheric and transition region lines
showed different behavior in the upﬂows compared to the
cores of two active regions.
It is still unclear, however, if
these signatures are evidence of the driving mechanism of the
upﬂows operating at low heights. It is also possible that they
are revealing a chromospheric response to the changed coro-
nal environment of open-ﬁeld regions. Based on the multi-
wavelength analysis of Hinode/EIS and IRIS data, Barczyn-
ski et al. (2021) argue that at least three parallel mechanisms
generate the plasma upﬂow, and that these mechanisms are
localized in the chromosphere, transition region, and corona.
AR 12737 emerged on the Earth facing solar disk on 2019,
March 31, during the 2nd PSP encounter, and was targetted
1–2 days later by EIS and IRIS. From a case study of AR
12737, we will show evidence that 1) the upﬂows in this re-
gion are formed low down, in the early emergence phase,
when it is still relatively small, and 2) once formed, the up-
ﬂows exist for the entire observed lifetime of the region.

2. OBSERVATIONS

In this work we use several datasets from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012).
These were downloaded via the web-based interface to the
Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford, are cal-
ibrated and correspond to level 1.5. We retrieved 193 ˚A data
for two long duration time-periods at 156 s and 600 s ca-

193Å2019−03−31 00:002019−03−31 10:002019−03−31 20:002019−04−01 06:00AR UPFLOWS

dence, and a high cadence (12 s) multi-wavelength (304 ˚A,
171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 211 ˚A) dataset around the time of the up-
ﬂow onset.

For Doppler velocity maps of the active region corona we
use EIS measurements. EIS is a dual spectrograph that ob-
serves in the 171–211 ˚A and 245–291 ˚A wavelength ranges
with a spectral resolution of 22.3 m ˚A. To account for in-
strumental effects (defective pixels, dark current, cosmic ray
hits) we reduced the data using the eis prep SolarSoftware
routine. The observations we analyze are 261(cid:48)(cid:48) × 512(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld-
of-view (FOV) rasters of AR 12737 using the 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit with
coarse scan steps of 3(cid:48)(cid:48). The exposure time was 40 s.

To obtain the Doppler velocity maps we ﬁt the strong
Fe XII 195.119 ˚A spectral line. We used a double Gaus-
sian function to take account of the density sensitive Fe XII
blend at 195.179 ˚A. Measured line centroids were converted
to velocities after ﬁrst correcting for spectral motion across
the CCD, due to instrument structure temperature variations
around the Hinode orbit, using the artiﬁcial neural network
model of Kamio et al. (2010). We then calibrated the veloci-
ties to a reference wavelength obtained by averaging the top
part of the FOV, and ﬁnally removed a residual orbital vari-
ation that was present following the strategy of Brooks et al.
(2020). This last step was necessary since the neural network
model uses data from early in the mission that are less appli-
cable to recent observations. The accuracy is on the order of
4–5 km s−1, though we do not use any actual values in this
study.

For observations of chromospheric structure and velocities
we used IRIS. The IRIS instrument observes two wavelength
bands in the far and near-ultraviolet (FUV & NUV) covering
1332–1407 ˚A and 2783–2835 ˚A. IRIS has a slit-jaw imager
and spectrograph. Here we focus on observations in the Si IV
1393 ˚A, C II 1335 ˚A, and Mg II 2796 ˚A spectral lines. These
cover the transition region, upper chromosphere, and mid to
upper chromosphere, respectively. We use level-2 data, and
these are processed to account for instrumental effects (dark
current, geometric effects, ﬂat-ﬁeld, orbital wavelength vari-
ation). The observations we analyze are 129(cid:48)(cid:48) × 126(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV
rasters constructed from coarse (2(cid:48)(cid:48) step scans) at a spatial
resolution of 0.33–0.4(cid:48)(cid:48). The exposure time was 15 s.

Doppler velocity maps of the upper chromosphere and
transition region were derived from spectral ﬁts to the C II
1335 ˚A and Si IV 1393 ˚A lines. The Si IV 1393 ˚A ve-
locities are derived from the line peak of a single Gaussian
ﬁt. The C II 1335 ˚A line proﬁles are complex and can be
singly or doubly peaked. The velocities here are derived
from the peak if the proﬁle has a single peak, but are com-
puted from the line reversal position if the proﬁle is double
peaked. We used the algorithm of Rathore et al. (2015) to
identify the proﬁle peaks. We also constructed a map of
the Mg II 2796 ˚A k2 asymmetry i.e.
the difference in in-

tensity between the peaks in the red and blue wings of the
line proﬁle. A positive asymmetry can imply upﬂows due to
increased absorption in the blue wing, while a negative asym-
metry can imply downﬂows due to increased absorption in
the red wing. We analyzed the Mg II spectral proﬁles using
the iris get mg features lev2 procedure available in the IRIS
branch of SolarSoftware (Freeland & Handy 1998).

We also compare our analysis of AIA images with type
III radio noise data recorded by the FIELDS (Bale et al.
2016) Radio Frequency Spectrometer (RFS, Pulupa et al.
2017) on PSP. The RFS obtains full Stokes parameters us-
ing low- and high-frequency receivers covering a wide range
from 10.5 kHz to 19.17 MHz. The usual spectral cadence is
7 s. We only use a subset of the RFS encounter 2 data, de-
scribed in detail by Harra et al. (2021), for illustration. We
focus only on the frequency of maximum Stokes intensity.
The data were reduced as described in Harra et al. (2021).

3. ANALYSIS RESULTS

3.1. Evolution of the upﬂows

AR 12737 was a quiescent active region. Despite its emer-
gence the GOES X-ray ﬂux remained below B-class while it
was the sole region on disk. Figure 1 shows AIA 193 ˚A im-
ages to give an overview of its emergence phase. It appears to
have evolved from a cusp-shaped loop arcade around 00 UT
on March 31. By 10 UT it is clear that a new active region is
forming, and this development phase lasts several hours. By
20 UT the typical structure of an active region has formed. In
Figure 1 we can see a hot core loop arcade, high lying mil-
lion degree loops, and dark channels from the active region
edge, which often show propagating motions in imaging data.
These dark areas at the active region edge typically show up-
ﬂow signatures when observed by EIS (Doschek et al. 2008).
In section 3.2 we attempt to estimate these time periods more
quantitatively.

EIS moved to observe AR 12737 from 15:51 UT on April
1, and tracked the region across the solar disk, making a ﬁnal
slit scan at 06:39 UT on April 9. Figure 2 shows an overview
of these observations. EIS spectroscopically conﬁrms the ex-
istence of upﬂows in the dark channels on both the east and
west sides of AR 12737 as early as 16 UT on April 1.

Harra et al. (2021) used linear force-free ﬁeld models to
establish the global coronal structure of AR 12737, and dis-
cussed the expansion and development of the eastern upﬂow
after April 1 in detail. They show that the area of the blue-
shifted upﬂow expands by a factor of 10 between April 1 and
April 4, that the region is associated with large scale mag-
netic ﬁeld lines in their model, and that the area associated
with these large scale ﬁeld lines increases as the AR expands.
This seems to be driven by the expansion of closed loops to
the south east of the AR, which appear as red-shifted in the
EIS velocity map of April 1 (Figure 2 left panel). We show

lines are a composite from different models and the details
are described in Harra et al. (2021).

Figure 2 also shows that the eastern upﬂow is still clearly
visible on April 9. Projection effects, however, mean that
we can no longer detect blue-shifted emission in the western
upﬂow.

IRIS scanned AR 12737 from 05:17–05:36 UT on April
2 (∼13.5 hours after the ﬁrst EIS scan). Figure 4 shows in-
tensity and velocity diagnostics from the transition region (Si
IV 1393 ˚A) down through the upper (C II 1335 ˚A) and mid-
to upper chromosphere (Mg II 2796 ˚A). Polito et al. (2020)
previously reported chromospheric signatures of coronal up-
ﬂows in IRIS observations of two active regions. They found
that the average redshift in the Si IV 1393 ˚A line was re-
duced, the C II 1335 ˚A line was slightly blueshifted, and that
Mg II k2 asymmetries were present, in the upﬂows compared
to the active region core. Figure 4 indicates that these charac-
teristics are present in the eastern upﬂow of AR 12737. Note,
for example, the strong redshifts in the core of the region in
the Si IV 1393 ˚A velocity map, and the reduced redshift (oc-
casional blueshift) to the east (second panel of Figure 4.

These observations provide another example of chromo-
spheric signatures of the upﬂows, but they appear to be re-
duced in AR 12737 compared to the active regions analyzed
by Polito et al. (2020). Visual inspection of the locations
compared to the EIS data suggests that the spatial correla-
tion is not as clear, especially as the morphology of the up-
ﬂow has already evolved in the 13 hours between the EIS
and IRIS observations. The weaker signatures are probably
due to the fact that AR 12737 was not yet fully developed
on April 2, so the spectral lines were also weaker, and the
upﬂow region had not yet expanded to the extent observed
on April 4. These results do indicate, however, that chromo-
spheric signatures of the upﬂows have already appeared by
two days into the lifetime of the active region.

We have attempted to pinpoint the transition from an
emerging ﬂux region to a formed active region with upﬂows
using a combination of time-slice intensity tracking, cross-
correlation analysis of images, and simple visual inspec-
tion. Without spectroscopic data of the very early emergence
phase this is, of course, difﬁcult to conﬁrm, but here we dis-
cuss evidence that the upﬂows may have formed as early as
12–16 UT on March 31.

First, while viewing AIA movies of the emerging active
region, we noticed a small eruption from the east side around
10 UT. Figure 5 shows multi-wavelength AIA images of the
mini-eruption. The ﬁgure is linked to a 30 min animation
in the same format. The eruption is best seen in the 304 ˚A
images, and in temperatures below ∼2 MK (formation tem-
perature of the 211 ˚A band). Prior to the eruption the region
is bipolar with a closed ﬁeld cusp shaped arcade – as was
shown in Figure 1 left panel. After the eruption, the loop
arcade appears to spread open and rapidly develop. Loops
appear to draw back from the location where the upﬂows are
later observed, and start to interact with the closed ﬁeld to
the south east: a process that seems to be integral to the ex-
pansion of the upﬂows after April 1. Even as early as shortly
after the eruption on March 31 it appears that large scale,
open, or distantly connecting long loops develop. The ﬁeld
is predominantly positive in the core of the AR at this time,
with only weak scattered negative ﬂux to the north so that
ﬁeld lines from the south east can only connect far from the
region i.e. the negative polarities that counterbalance the pos-
itive ﬁeld are not nearby. This is the picture we also get from
a magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation we attempted, though unfortu-
nately the AR is too close to the east limb for the model to be
convincing and reliable - so we do not include it here.

The features of the small eruption can be seen in the space-
time intensity plot of Figure 6, which shows high cadence
(12 s) 304 ˚A data obtained between 10–12 UT on March 31.
The plot is made by stacking intensities extracted along the
thin blue line shown in Figure 5. Relatively stable structures,
such as the active region itself, appear as broad horizontal
trails in the plot, whereas dynamic features that move rapidly
along the line appear as streaks. The sky blue arrow P 0
points out the streak at the start of the small eruption just

after 10 UT (around 60(cid:48)(cid:48) along the slice-line). The fuzzier
‘W’ shaped streaks following P 0 are a result of the loops
spreading open and then retracting.

To quantitatively show when the active region emerged and
infer when the upﬂows developed, we examined space-time
intensity cuts of the AIA 193 ˚A data. Figure 7 shows a con-
text image with two slice-lines overlaid in sky blue and red.
We examined several slice-lines but these two illustrate the
behavior of the eastern upﬂow. Note that they are not opti-
mised for the upﬂows on the western side. The sky blue line
runs across the eastern dark lane where EIS later detects up-
ﬂows. The idea here is to try to trace back, from when we
know the dark emission is associated with upﬂows detected
by EIS, to as early as we can in the active region develop-
ment. The red line runs across the central loop arcade to
try to trace the dark emission farther back in time when AR
12737 was small, and the upﬂows, if formed, would be closer
to the core. As the lines run across the upﬂow and bright core
we expect that when they are stacked in time we should see
a bright trail across the space-time plot that represents the
core region, and a dark trail below it that represents the area
where the upﬂow is later detected. We used 193 ˚A data at
156 s cadence for this analysis.

Figure 8 shows the results. The top left panel is the space-
time plot for the sky blue line in Figure 7. We can see the
emergence of the active region from ∼10–11 UT and the de-
velopment of the bright loop arcade ∼14 UT in the center
of the space-time plot, as expected. The loop arcade fur-
ther brightens and expands thereafter, trailing left to right
across the space-time plot (approximately between the 91(cid:48)(cid:48)
and 182(cid:48)(cid:48) tick marks on the Y-axis). We point out a dark trail
below the bright trail with the sky blue arrows P 1 and P 2
(crossing left to right and centered approximately on the 91(cid:48)(cid:48)
tick mark). This is the trace of the dark areas at the eastern
edge of the active region where we expect upﬂows should be
observed. To reiterate, this is simply because of the usual
correlation between low intensity and blue-shifts observed
previously in many active regions (Doschek et al. 2008). For
ease of identiﬁcation we have also added a dotted line in the
dark trail. As discussed, EIS does indeed later detect upﬂows

line-of-sight intereference by the bright loop arcade. Nev-
ertheless, the sky blue arrow, P 3, points out that the dark
trail of the eastern upﬂow can be traced back to around ∼12–
13 UT. We again added a dotted line for ease of identiﬁcation.
The middle panel of Figure 8 shows results from our
image-to-image correlation analysis. The idea here is to es-
tablish when the active region has formed its basic structure
(likely with upﬂows). We compute the linear Pearson corre-
lation coefﬁcient, r, between successive images for two time
periods (08 UT March 31–08 UT April 1 and 00 UT March
31–00 UT April 2) at two different cadences (156 s and 600 s)
inside the boxed region shown in Figure 7. When there are
large changes between successive images, r will decrease,
and when there are minimal changes, r will increase. We
use the higher cadence data to ensure we capture any rapid
changes. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the two datasets
show essentially the same result. The correlation coefﬁcient
between images is high, r above 0.95 for most of the time-
series, as we would expect given that AR 12737 was a qui-
escent region. Both time series also show that ﬂux emerged
rapidly between ∼10–13 UT. Dynamic activity during emer-
gence caused r to fall as low as ∼0.85, but changes began
to reduce after this time and r returned to its typical value by
14–16 UT. These timescales and periods are in line with what
we discerned from the AIA movies and space-time plots. AR
12737 does not appear to alter signiﬁcantly from this time
until EIS observes the upﬂows.

The lower panel of Figure 8 shows data from FIELDS/RFS
for the same time-period as the image-to-image correlation
analysis. The data are derived from radio Stokes I intensities
detected by RFS in its two highest frequency bins (18.28–
19.17 MHz). The plot shows the frequencies of the maximum
of the mode normalized (over 40 s windows) Stokes I inten-
sities. As discussed by Harra et al. (2021), the radio noise
storm detected at PSP appears most likely associated with
the eastern upﬂow as it expands from April 1 to April 4. The
drift to lower frequencies with time also suggests the emis-
sion height, or lateral expansion, is increasing. Looking here
at the time period closer to active region emergence, sporadic

in the Eastern region. It seems that the dark region can be
traced back as far as the ﬁrst P 1 arrow ∼16 UT.

The top right panel shows the space-time plot for the slice-
line closer in to the active region core (red in Figure 7). Being
closer to the location of ﬂux emergence, this slice-line shows
the appearance of the active region earlier (before 10 UT).
Since the region is emerging at this time, any upﬂows that
are forming are also more likely to be obscured by the grow-
ing loop arcade. We can see this in the ﬁgure. The dark trail,
again crossing left to right and here approximately centered
on the 97(cid:48)(cid:48) Y-axis tick mark, brightens and fades due to the

associated with upﬂows) formed from 12–16 UT. Space-time
intensity plots and image-to-image correlation analysis sup-
port this picture and show that the active region did not alter
appreciably until EIS observed it at 15:50 UT on April 1.
At this time, EIS conﬁrmed the presence of blue-shifted up-
ﬂows associated with large-scale ﬁeld lines connecting out of
the AR, from both the east and west edges, in force-free ﬁeld

later, and detected signatures of the upﬂow in the chromo-
sphere and transition region. The active region grew and
the upﬂow area expanded between April 1–4. The magnetic
ﬁeld modeling is consistent with this expansion, and there
is an associated increase in the number of large-scale (poten-
tially open) ﬁeld lines (Harra et al. 2021). The eastern upﬂow
was still present when the region was last observed by EIS at
06:39 UT on April 9. The region was observed for 9 days.

We conclude that the upﬂows in AR 12737 formed early
in its lifetime (no later than 32 hours after emergence) and
persisted for as long as EIS tracked it (85% of the observed
lifetime). Any contribution to the slow solar wind is therefore
not a short lived phenomenon.

The lack of spectroscopic data within the ﬁrst 32 hours
makes it difﬁcult to conﬁrm the exact time of upﬂow for-
mation, but our analysis also suggests that it occurred earlier.
Based on the space-time and correlation analysis, the eastern
upﬂow can be traced back to when the typical structure of the
active region was formed between 12–16 UT on March 31.
That is, the upﬂow may have formed as little as 4–8 hours
after emergence and persisted for 95% of the observed life-
time. The small eruption could have opened the magnetic
ﬁeld on the eastern side before this, and the onset of the radio
noise storm detected by FIELDS/RFS occurred at the start of
this period. We should add the caveat that the upﬂow might
not contribute to the slow wind all the time it is observed,
but magnetic modeling of the region suggests it is associated
with large-scale expanding ﬁeld lines the whole time that it
was tracked, so in principle the plasma ﬂows can become
outﬂows and escape to the heliosphere.

The evidence also suggests that the upﬂow formation oc-
curs low down in the atmosphere. The mini-eruption ejected
from the base of the cusp loop arcade soon after emergence
while the active region was still small. It was also best ob-
served in the AIA ﬁlters associated with cooler temperatures,
especially 304 ˚A. Even if we only consider the spectroscopic
data, possible signatures of the upﬂows were observed in the
chromosphere and transition region by IRIS on April 2, and
the EIS data show that the active region and upﬂow did not
grow to their full extent until April 4. This implies that the
upﬂow formation was well underway before AR 12737 had
expanded to interact with high lying magnetic ﬁelds. The
radio noise storm observed by FIELDS/RFS also showed a
frequency drift that can be interpreted as the emission height

indications of the start of the high frequency (>10 MHz) ra-
dio emission are seen as early as 8–10 UT, while the noise
storm is clearly visible from 13 UT onwards.
If the radio
noise storm is associated with the upﬂows, then the RFS
data independently support the conclusion that the upﬂows
formed in the 10–13 UT period as the active region devel-
oped following the small eruption. The radio emission drift
to lower frequencies is already visible on March 31 – April
1.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have studied the formation and lifetime of the eastern
upﬂow from AR 12737 using EUV spectroscopic observa-
tions from EIS, NUV & FUV spectroscopic data from IRIS,
images from AIA, and radio data from FIELDS/RFS. Our
goal was to understand where and how quickly upﬂows form
in an active region, and how long they might contribute to the
slow solar wind during the observed lifetime.

These observations establish the following timeline. The
active region emerged and developed from a cusp shaped
loop arcade from 8 UT on March 31. A small eruption oc-
curred ∼10 UT, and the typical structure of an active region
with bright core loops and peripheral dark features (usually
