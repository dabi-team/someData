We present a numerical study to investigate the ﬂuid-structure interaction of a ﬂexible circular
cantilever cylinder in a uniform cross-ﬂow. We employ a fully-coupled ﬂuid-structure solver based on
the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. We examine
the dynamics of the cylinder for a wide range of reduced velocities (U ∗), mass ratios (m∗), and
Reynolds numbers (Re). Of particular interest is to explore the possibility of ﬂow-induced vibrations
in a slender cantilever cylinder of aspect ratio AR = 100 at laminar subcritical Re regime (i.e., no
periodic vortex shedding). We assess the extent to which such a ﬂexible cylindrical beam can sustain
ﬂow-induced vibrations and characterize the contribution of the beam’s ﬂexibility to the stability
of the wake at low Re. We show that when certain conditions are satisﬁed, the ﬂexible cantilever
cylinder undergoes sustained large-amplitude vibrations. The frequency of the oscillations is found
to match the frequency of the periodic ﬂuid forces for a particular range of system parameters.
In this range, the frequency of the transverse vibrations is shown to match the ﬁrst-mode natural
frequency of the cylinder, indicating the existence of the lock-in phenomenon. The range of the
lock-in regime is shown to have a strong dependence on Re and m∗. We discover that unlike the
steady wake behind a stationary rigid cylinder, the wake of a low mass ratio ﬂexible cantilever
cylinder could lose its stability in the lock-in regime at Reynolds numbers as low as Re = 22. A
combined VIV-galloping type instability is shown to be the possible cause of the wake instability
at this Re regime. These ﬁndings attempt to generalize our understanding of the ﬂow-induced
vibrations in ﬂexible cantilever structures and can have a profound impact on the development of
novel ﬂow-measurement sensors.

INTRODUCTION

Flow-induced vibrations (FIVs) have signiﬁcant conse-
quences and are essential to predict in numerous ﬁelds,
such as marine/oﬀshore, civil, biomedical, and aerospace
engineering. Considerable research has been done in re-
cent decades to characterize the underlying mechanism
and explore the practical aspects of ﬂow-induced vibra-
tions in a wide range of domains, including vibration con-
trol [1–3], energy harvesting [4–8], and sensing [9, 10].
The phenomenon of ﬂow-induced vibration in bluﬀ bod-
ies has received special attention in the literature due
to complex vortex dynamics and nonlinear physics in-
volved in the interaction of a bluﬀ body and ﬂuid ﬂow. In
this regard, the ﬂow-induced vibration of an elastically-
mounted rigid cylinder has served as a prototypical model
for both experimental and numerical studies [11].
It
has been shown that asymmetric vortex shedding from
the wake of an elastically-mounted rigid cylinder exerts
unsteady transverse loads that could lead to sustained
large-amplitude vibrations called vortex-induced vibra-
tions (VIVs) [12]. VIVs are characterized by a frequency
match between the frequency of the periodic vortex shed-
ding and the vibration frequency of the cylinder [12, 13].
When the natural frequency of the cylinder is close to the

vortex shedding frequency, the VIV phenomenon results
in a complex evolution of the shedding frequency, which
deviates from the Strouhal frequency of its stationary
counterpart. In this frequency regime, the vortex forma-
tion locks on to the natural frequency of the structure,
which in turn creates a strong coupling between the cylin-
der and ﬂuid ﬂow [12]. Several studies have shown that
the peak vibration amplitude of an elastically-mounted
rigid cylinder, with only one degree-of-freedom in the
transverse direction, is approximately O(D) [14], where
D denotes the cylinder diameter. The magnitude of the
peak vibration amplitude is known to be a function of
ﬂuid and structural parameters, such as Reynolds num-
ber and mass-damping ratio [15], and has been shown to
have a slightly higher value for a two-degree-of-freedom
cylinder [16]. Comprehensive reviews regarding the VIV
of elastically-mounted rigid cylinders could be found in
Refs. [14, 15, 17–19].

More recently, studies have focused on the dynamic
response of ﬂexible slender structures at high Reynolds
numbers [20–22] to give new physical insight into the
phenomenon of vortex-induced vibrations. Due to the
complex interaction of nonlinear wake dynamics with nu-
merous ﬂexible modes, the VIV modeling and prediction
poses serious challenges for long ﬂexible structures. For
example, studies on thin risers have found that ocean
currents excite several vibration modes and frequencies
along the span of a riser during VIVs [23–25]. In a short-
term perspective, VIV eﬀects can lead to drag ampliﬁca-
tion and large dynamic bending stresses. These large-

amplitude vibrations lead to fatigue failure in slender
structures and marine risers in the long term if not con-
trolled properly [26]. An Experimental study on the VIV
of a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder in the laminar ﬂow regime
has found some distinct diﬀerences between the dynam-
ics of a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder and a ﬂexible riser in
the VIV regime. A ﬂexible pinned-pinned beam, such as
a marine riser, has been shown to vibrate at monotoni-
cally increasing frequencies with each eigenmode gradu-
ally growing in modal weight as the reduced velocity is
increased [27]. However, for a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder,
although higher modes are observed at higher reduced ve-
locities, the cylinder has been shown to oscillate with only
one vibration eigenmode during VIVs [28]. In line with
the works done in the ﬁeld of vortex-induced vibrations,
in our current work, we examine the dynamic response of
a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder at low Reynolds numbers to
give new insight into the topic of ﬂow-induced vibrations
in ﬂexible slender structures.

Our interest in studying the dynamics of a ﬂexible
cantilever cylinder at low Reynolds numbers originates
from the intriguing problem of sensing through whiskers
in some mammals, such as rats and seals. Experimen-
tal studies on the mechanical response of isolated rat
vibrissae (whiskers) to low-speed airﬂow have revealed
that air currents of magnitude 0.5 to 5.6 m/s, typically
found in natural environments, generate signiﬁcant vib-
rissal motion that carries information about the direction
and magnitude of the airﬂow [29, 30]. More interest-
ingly, behavioral experiments have shown that rats use
the information from their whiskers to localize airﬂow
sources [31]. To characterize the geometry of a rat’s ta-
pered conical whisker, two parameters, namely arc length
S and base diameter Db, are deﬁned. Typically, in a
rat’s mystacial pad, the ratio of a whisker’s arc length S
to base diameter Db is between 100 < S/Db < 400 and
the wind speeds translate into Reynolds numbers < 50,
based on Db of the whisker [29].

In addition to rats, harbor seals, for example, have
been shown to use their highly sensitive undulated
whiskers to sense hydrodynamic information of water
ﬂows and detect ﬂuid structures without auditory or vi-
sual cues [32]. An experimental study on a model of a seal
whisker has shown that a whisker in the wake of a station-
ary rigid cylinder undergoes large-amplitude oscillations,
with the frequency of the oscillations being close to the
shedding frequency of the upstream wake [33]. These os-
cillations are known to help seals detect upstream wakes
and estimate the size and shape of the wake-generating
body [33].

Although considerable research has been done to un-
derstand the problem of sensing through whiskers, there
have been limited studies on the mechanism behind the
dynamics of whiskers in ﬂuid ﬂow.
In particular, the
oscillatory response of a whisker at laminar subcritical
Reynolds numbers, i.e., Re < Recr ≈ 45 [34, 35], is not
well understood.
In our current work, we investigate
ﬂuid-structure interaction of a ﬂexible cantilever cylin-

2

der, as a simpliﬁed model of a whisker, to help answer
two speciﬁc questions: (i) can we observe sustained vi-
brations in the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder at subcritical
Re with laminar wake ﬂow, and (ii) what is the relation-
ship between the cylinder dynamics and stability of the
wake at this Re regime? Understanding the underlying
ﬂuid-structure dynamics of a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder,
inspired by the dynamics of whiskers, is of vital impor-
tance for developing novel ﬂow-measurement sensors [9]
and brings us one step closer towards a complete map-
ping of the sensing properties of whiskers.

The key non-dimensional parameters involved in the
ﬂuid-structure interaction of the ﬂexible cantilever cylin-
der are mass ratio m∗, Reynolds number Re, and reduced
velocity U ∗ deﬁned as

m∗ =

where m is the mass per unit length of the cylinder, D
is the cylinder diameter, ρf and µf are the density and
dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid, respectively, U0 is the mag-
nitude of the uniform ﬂow velocity, and fn is the natu-
ral frequency of the ﬁrst mode of vibration. The non-
dimensional parameters studied in our current work are
within 20 ≤ Re ≤ 40, U ∗ ∈ [2, 19] and 1 ≤ m∗ ≤ 1000,
which cover a practical range of values in the laminar
subcritical Re regime.

A schematic of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder is given
in Fig. 1. The cylinder is connected to a ﬁxed support at
z = 0. The Young’s modulus and second moment of area
of the cylinder are denoted by E and I, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 1, due to ﬂuid forces acting on the cylinder,
it initially deforms in the streamwise direction. Also, de-
pending on the system parameters, the cylinder could ex-
hibit an unsteady dynamic response, resulting in periodic
vortex shedding patterns in the wake region. A system-
atic analysis of the dynamic response of the cylinder is
conducted in our current work, where we use high-ﬁdelity

teraction of the cylinder for a broad range of system pa-
rameters.

The content of the paper is structured as follows. The
governing equations for modeling the cylinder dynamics
and the coupling strategy between the ﬂuid and struc-
tural solvers are discussed in Section II. In addition, we
provide the results for the grid convergence study at the
end of this section. In section III we cover the results of
our study and discuss the dynamic response characteris-
tics of the cylinder in detail. Finally, we ﬁnish the paper
with a conclusion in section IV.

II. NUMERICAL METHODOLOGY

This section presents a three-dimensional numerical
framework for studying the ﬂuid-structure interaction of
the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder with an incompressible vis-
cous ﬂow. To model the coupled dynamics of the cylin-
der, we employ a three-dimensional computational do-
main as shown in Fig. 2. The cylinder is placed at an
oﬀset distance of 15D and 45D from the inﬂow and out-
ﬂow surfaces, respectively. Fixed structural support is
imposed at one end of the cylinder (z = 0), and the no-
slip boundary condition is applied at the ﬂuid-structure
interface Γfs. The size of the computational domain is
60D ×30D ×L where a uniform velocity of uf = (U0, 0, 0)
with a magnitude of U0 in the x-direction is given at the
inﬂow surface. The slip boundary condition is applied to
the side surfaces Γf
side−2, and the traction-
free boundary condition, given by σf .nf = 0, is speciﬁed
at the outﬂow surface.

side−1 and Γf

In the following, we discuss the governing equations for
modeling the dynamics of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder
and present the strategy implemented to couple the ﬂuid
and structural solvers.

A. Governing equations

We consider

incompressible
the three-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Euler-Bernoulli
beam theory to examine the coupled dynamics of the
ﬂexible cantilever cylinder. We formulate the governing
equation for the Euler-Bernoulli beam in a Lagrangian
reference frame and take a body-ﬁtted moving bound-
ary approach based on the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
(ALE) description [36] to formulate the unsteady Navier-
Stokes equations for the viscous incompressible ﬂuid.
The body-ﬁtted treatment of the ﬂuid-structure inter-
face through the ALE description of the ﬂow ﬁeld pro-
vides accurate modeling of the boundary layer over the
deformable surface of the structure.

the partial derivative of uf with respect to time while the

lated by integrating the surface traction at the ﬁrst layer

present the equation for modeling the structural dynam-
ics of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder using the Euler-
Bernoulli beam theory.

2. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for a ﬂexible structure

We consider the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder as a slender
structure with relatively small lateral motions. There-
fore, the Euler Bernoulli beam theory can be applied to
model its dynamic response. Let Ωs be the structural
domain consisting of structure coordinates xs = (x, y, z).
We solve the transverse displacements ws(z, t) using the
Euler-Bernoulli beam equation excited by the distributed
unsteady ﬂuid force per unit length f s. The motion of
the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder is governed by the ﬂuid
forces and involves integrating pressure and shear stress
eﬀects on the cylinder surface. Neglecting the damping
and shear eﬀects, we take the equation of motion for the
ﬂexible cantilever cylinder as:

To solve Eq. (7), we consider a mode superposition ap-
proach for the dynamic response of the cylinder. The nth

is given by

where n is the mode number, ma is the added mass of
the ﬂuid per unit length deﬁned as ma = πD2ρf /4 and
λn is the dimensionless frequency parameter for the nth
mode of vibration. The λn values are given in Table I.
The modal parameters are based on the values reported
in Ref. [37] for ﬂexible cantilever beams of constant cross
section.

The cylinder motion is solved using simple linear vibra-
tion analysis. The displacements from the mean position

of the cylinder are assumed to be small and character-
ized based on the normal modes of the vibration found
using an eigenvalue analysis. The mode shapes of the
cantilever cylinder are taken as the sums of sine, cosine,
sinh, and cosh functions of λnz/L written as:

3. Treatment of the ﬂuid-structure interface

We need to satisfy the continuity of velocity and trac-
tion at the ﬂuid-structure interface. Let Γfs = ∂Ωf (0) ∩
∂Ωs be the ﬂuid-structure interface at t = 0 and Γfs(t) =
ϕs(Γfs, t) be the interface at time t. The required condi-
tions to be satisﬁed are as follows:

the ﬂuid traction vector relating to the ﬂuid forcing as
f s(z, t) = (cid:82)

ﬂuid part at time t. The above conditions are satisﬁed
such that the ﬂuid velocity is exactly equal to the velocity
of the structure at the ﬂuid-structure interface.

To couple the ﬂuid and structure equations, we use
a nonlinear partitioned iterative approach based on the
nonlinear iterative force correction (NIFC) scheme de-
scribed in [38, 39]. At each time step, the ﬂuid traction
applied to the surface of the cylinder is projected onto the
eigenvectors to ﬁnd the values of the generalized modal
forces. The projected modal forces are then used to de-
termine the modal amplitudes and displacements for the
next time step.

To account for the changes in the cylinder geometry, we
explicitly control the motion of each mesh node while sat-
isfying the kinematic consistency of the discretized inter-
face. The movement of the internal ﬁnite element nodes
is chosen such that the mesh quality does not deterio-
rate as the displacements of the cylinder become large.
For this purpose, we assume the ﬂuid mesh to represent
a hyperelastic solid model. In addition, a standard La-
grangian ﬁnite element technique is used to adapt the
mesh to the new geometry of the domain.

B. Grid convergence study

The coupled dynamics of the ﬂexible cantilever cylin-
der is examined through a numerical framework that has
been veriﬁed and validated extensively for FSI problems
in an earlier study [24]. Thus, we proceed with the grid
convergence study here. We discretize the computational
domain into unstructured hexahedral ﬁnite element grids
with a boundary layer mesh around the ﬂexible cantilever
cylinder.

We start with a relatively coarse grid denoted by M1
and successively increase the number of elements by ap-
proximately a factor of 2 to achieve the M2 and M3
meshes. An isometric view of the discretized domain and
a z-plane slice of the unstructured grid for the M2 mesh
is given in Fig. 3.

For the grid convergence study, we have examined the
dynamics of the cylinder at Re = 40, m∗ = 1, and
U ∗ = 11. Grid convergence errors are calculated by tak-
ing the ﬁnest mesh, M3, as the reference case. The values
of the frequency ratio (fy/fn), mean streamwise deforma-
tion (Ax/D), root-mean-square (rms) of the dimension-
less transverse vibration amplitude (Arms
/D), and the
force coeﬃcients (CD and C rms

L
According to Table II, the relative errors using the M2
mesh are less than 2%; therefore, the M2 mesh is chosen
as the suitable grid for our present study. The results
mentioned in Table II are for a computational domain
with 16 layers in the spanwise direction. After doing an
independent grid convergence study on the number of
spanwise layers, ranging from 8 to 64, we found that
16 layers are adequate to capture the essential three-
dimensional features of the ﬂuid-structure system.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we present our results for the ﬂuid-
structure interaction of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder
for 20 ≤ Re ≤ 40, U ∗ ∈ [2, 19] and 1 ≤ m∗ ≤ 1000.
In addition, we discuss the wake dynamics for the range
of studied parameters. Finally, we relate our ﬁndings to
real-world observations regarding the oscillatory motion
of whiskers in laminar ﬂuid ﬂow.

A. Response characteristics

We ﬁrst present the response characteristics of the ﬂex-
ible cantilever cylinder at m∗ = 1 for 20 ≤ Re ≤ 40 and
U ∗ ∈ [2, 19]. The root-mean-square (rms) values of the
dimensionless transverse vibration amplitude Arms
/D at
the tip of the cylinder (z/L = 1) is given in Fig. 4. We
ﬁnd that at Re = 20, the cylinder remains in its steady
deﬂected position, i.e., Arms
= 0, within the range of
studied U ∗. This steady response is also observed at
Re = 22 for U ∗ ≤ 6 and at 24 ≤ Re ≤ 40 for U ∗ ≤ 5
(see Fig. 4). However, there is a particular range of U ∗
within which the cylinder is shown to undergo sustained
vibrations for 22 ≤ Re ≤ 40. We observe that the peak of
the transverse vibration amplitude in this range is within
U ∗ ∈ [7, 8]. As shown in Fig. 4, at Re = 22, the peak of
the Arms
/D is at U ∗ = 8 with a magnitude of approx-
imately 0.18. However, at higher Re, the peak of the
vibration amplitude shifts to U ∗ = 7, where the oscilla-
tions are shown to grow in magnitude as Re is increased.
For instance, the peak of the Arms
/D has a magnitude of
approximately 0.26 at Re = 24, whereas at Re = 40, the
maximum Arms
/D is approximately equal to 0.49. We
ﬁnd that at Re = 40, the cylinder experiences sustained
oscillations for reduced velocities between U ∗ ∈ [6, 19];
however, for lower Re, the oscillations are present for a
narrower range of U ∗. A more broadband oscillatory re-
sponse with respect to U ∗ at higher Re is due to larger
inertial ﬂuid forces that overcome the viscous damping.
Fig. 5a demonstrates the time histories of the trans-
verse vibration amplitude calculated from the mean de-
formed position of the cylinder (Ay − Ay)/D at z/L = 1
and lift coeﬃcient CL at Re = 40, m∗ = 1, and U ∗ = 7.
We observe that the transverse vibrations at the tip of the
cylinder are in-phase with the variations of the lift coef-
ﬁcient. In addition, we show that the peak of the dimen-
sionless transverse vibration frequency (fy/fn) matches
the peak of the dimensionless lift coeﬃcient frequency
(fCL/fn) in the frequency domain at fy/fn = fCL /fn = 1
(see Fig. 5b). This frequency match indicates that the
lock-in phenomenon is driving the oscillations at U ∗ = 7.

vibration frequency fy/fn and lift coeﬃcient frequency

to U ∗ in Fig. 6. We show that at Re = 22, fy/fn and

ﬁgure-eight type motion trajectory is observed across the
cylinder length. These trajectories are shown to grow in

magnitude by moving towards the tip of the cylinder.
The scalograms of the dynamic response of the cylinder
in the streamwise and transverse directions are given in
Figs. 7 b and c, respectively. We show that the cylinder
exhibits a standing wave response, with oscillations be-
ing in the ﬁrst mode of vibration in both the streamwise
and transverse directions.

Based on the scalograms of the cylinder response,
the dimensionless frequency of the streamwise oscilla-
tions (fx/fn) is found to be twice that of the dimen-
sionless frequency of the transverse vibrations (fy/fn),
i.e., fx/fn = 2fy/fn ≈ 2. This type of oscillatory
response has been previously observed in two-degrees-
of-freedom elastically mounted rigid cylinders undergo-
ing VIVs [40]. The motion trajectory of the tip of the
cylinder at Re = 40, and m∗ = 1 is given in Fig. 8 for
U ∗ ∈ [6, 11]. The ﬁgure-eight shape of the motion trajec-
tories is associated with the frequency ratio of fx/fy ≈ 2
in the lock-in regime.

B. Wake dynamics during lock-in

Here, we examine the wake dynamics in the lock-in
regime for the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder at laminar sub-
critical Re. A comparison between the wake of a station-
ary rigid cylinder at Re = 40, and the wake of the ﬂexible
cantilever cylinder at z/L = 0.5, Re = 40, m∗ = 1, and
U ∗ = 7 is given in Fig. 9. We show that the wake of the
stationary rigid cylinder is steady and symmetric with
respect to the wake centerline at Re = 40; however, for
the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder, the wake is unstable at

the same Re. To illustrate, we have examined the z-
vorticity (ωz) contours at diﬀerent cross-sections of the
ﬂexible cantilever cylinder. As shown in Fig. 10, the wake
of the cylinder is steady at z/L = 0 where it is connected
to ﬁxed support; however, by approaching the tip of the
cylinder, the ﬂow starts to become unstable, and peri-

odic vortex-shedding patterns are observed downstream.
This ﬁnding suggests a connection between the cylinder
motion and wake stability at laminar subcritical Re. To
examine this conjecture, we have provided the z-vorticity
iso-surfaces of the three-dimensional wake structures at
Re = 30 and m∗ = 1 in Fig. 11 for U ∗ = 3, 6 and 15.

At the given m∗ and Re, U ∗ = 3, 6 and 15 represent
the pre-lock-in, lock-in, and post-lock-in regimes, respec-
tively. We ﬁnd that the ﬂow ﬁeld in the wake of the
ﬂexible cantilever cylinder is steady at U ∗ = 3 (pre lock-
in) and U ∗ = 15 (post lock-in); however, an unsteady
wake is observed at U ∗ = 6 (see Fig. 11). The phase

diagram of the wake stability as a function of Re and U ∗
at m∗ = 1 is given in Fig. 12. We ﬁnd that at Re = 20,
the ﬂow ﬁeld is steady for all U ∗ values; however, as Re
is increased, the wake becomes unsteady for a particular
range of reduced velocities. As shown in Fig. 12, the ﬂow
ﬁeld in the wake of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder is un-

stable at Re = 22 for U ∗ ∈ [7, 9]. The range of the wake
unsteadiness is shown to become wider at higher Re. For
example, this range is between U ∗ ∈ [6, 13] at Re = 30
and increases to U ∗ ∈ [6, 19] at Re = 40. An important
point to note here is that there is a critical U ∗ ∈ [6, 7]
that marks the initiation of the wake unsteadiness for
22 ≤ Re ≤ 40. This critical U ∗ also marks the lower
bound of the lock-in regime, as shown in the results of
Section III A. Thus, we can infer that the range of the

FIG. 12: Phase diagram of the wake stability as a
function of Re and U ∗ at m∗ = 1. Here, ◦ denotes a
steady wake, while ∗ represents an unsteady wake
behind the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder.

wake unsteadiness is closely correlated with the range of
the lock-in regime at laminar subcritical Re.

We have provided the wake structures around the ﬂex-
ible cantilever cylinder at Re = 40 and m∗ = 1 for
5 ≤ U ∗ ≤ 14 in Fig. 13. At U ∗ = 5, which represents
the pre-lock-in regime, a steady wake ﬂow is observed
behind the cylinder; however, for U ∗ ≥ 6, the wake is
shown to become unstable, with two alternate vortices
being shed from the cylinder wake in each cycle. In ad-
dition, the wake structures close to the ﬁxed end of the
cylinder are found to be steady, regardless of U ∗. As
shown in Fig. 13, although an unsteady wake is observed
for U ∗ ≥ 6 at distances between z/L ∈ [0.2, 1] from the
ﬁxed end of the cylinder, the wake is shown to be steady
for z/L ∈ [0, 0.2]. Thus, we can deduce that the three-
dimensional ﬂow phenomena do not contribute to the
wake stability at this Re regime. For the ﬂow around
an isolated cylinder, the wake has been shown to ﬁrst
become three-dimensional at Re ≈ 200 [41].

With these ﬁndings, we can deduce that the wake of
a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder could become unsteady at
laminar subcritical Re, provided that two essential re-
quirements are met: (i) the ﬂow needs to have suﬃciently
large inertia to overcome the viscous damping and (ii)
the system parameters need to be in the lock-in range to
sustain the unsteadiness in the wake.

In the next section, we discuss the relationship between

the cylinder motion and stability of the wake in detail.

C. Relationship between the cylinder dynamics
and wake unsteadiness

Here, we pinpoint the relationship between the cylin-
der motion and stability of the wake at laminar subcrit-
ical Re. We recommend a combined VIV-galloping type
instability as the possible cause of the wake unsteadi-
ness for Re < Recr. Galloping is a velocity-dependent
and damping-controlled ﬂuid-structure instability, which
is generally observed in geometrically asymmetric struc-
tures [42]. Although the ﬂow ﬁeld around an asymmetric

structure is uniform in magnitude and direction, cross-
ﬂow oscillations of the asymmetric body alter the mag-
nitude and direction of the incident ﬂow with respect to
the body coordinate system. This change, in turn, alters
the ﬂuid forces acting on the body and could trigger the
galloping instability. A deviation from symmetric cross-
section in transmission lines due to ice formation [43]
or in marine cables due to marine organisms [44] are
some examples of the galloping instability in engineering
structures. Galloping is known to cause large-amplitude
sustained oscillations in ﬂexible or elastically-mounted

zxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxyzxystructures [42].

In contrast to vortex-induced vibrations, galloping in-
stability is induced by a relative body motion rather than
the unsteady ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow ﬁeld; hence it can
occur even for steady attached ﬂows. When the trans-
verse force acting on a ﬂexible or elastically-mounted
body increases in the direction of motion, it adds move-
ment to the body, and the body will displace further
until the opposing stiﬀness or damping overcomes the
movements, or the transverse force decreases when the
movement is increased. For a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder
interacting with ﬂuid ﬂow, the body is free to deform in
the streamwise and transverse directions. Although dis-
placements in the streamwise direction do not contribute
to the stability of the wake [45, 46], relative movements
in the transverse direction break the wake symmetry, al-
tering the ﬂuid forces acting on the cylinder. This sym-
metry breakdown, in turn, induces a galloping-type in-
stability by creating negative damping in the combined
ﬂuid-structure system. The low-speed galloping-type in-
stability, together with the frequency lock-in, is most ar-
guably the mechanism that leads to sustained unsteadi-
ness in the wake at laminar subcritical Re.

To better understand the relationship between the
cylinder motion and stability of the wake at laminar sub-
critical Re, we have provided the z-vorticity contours at
the mid-section of the cylinder at Re = 40, m∗ = 1, and
U ∗ = 7 in Fig. 14. We show that the wake region behind
the cylinder is steady and symmetric at tU0/D = 60;
however, for tU0/D ∈ [65, 75], relative motion of the
cylinder cross-section in the transverse direction, makes
the wake lose its stability and become asymmetric. This
symmetry breakdown, in turn, exerts a transverse load
that further increases the cylinder motion. Finally, due
to the coupling between the unsteady wake and the cylin-
der movements, large-amplitude transverse vibrations are
observed for tU0/D ∈ [80, 85].

In the next section, we investigate the eﬀect of mass ra-
tio m∗ on the dynamics of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder
and further examine the wake structures in the lock-in
regime.

D. Eﬀect of mass ratio

We ﬁrst investigate the eﬀect of mass ratio on the
dynamic response of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder at
Re = 40 for U ∗ ∈ [2, 19]. We examine the response
of the cylinder at four diﬀerent mass ratios, namely
m∗ = 1, 10, 100 and 1000. The results for the rms
value of the dimensionless transverse vibration ampli-
tude Arms
/D with respect to U ∗ are given in Fig. 15.
For all the studied mass ratios, we ﬁnd that the cylinder
stays at its steady deﬂected position for U ∗ ≤ 5. This
steady response is present for the whole range of U ∗ at
m∗ = 1000. However, a discrete change in the dynamic
response of the cylinder is observed for higher U ∗ val-
ues at m∗ = 1, 10 and 100. We observe a sudden jump

in the amplitude response of the cylinder at U ∗ = 6, 7
and 8 at mass ratios m∗ = 1, 10 and 100, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 15, the peak of the transverse vibra-
tion amplitude is at U ∗ = 7 for m∗ = 1 and 10, and
at U ∗ = 8 for m∗ = 100. The magnitude of the max-
imum Arms
/D is shown to be approximately 0.49, 0.47
and 0.39 at m∗ = 1, 10 and 100, respectively. By further
increasing the U ∗, a gradual decrease in the amplitude
of the transverse vibrations is observed at m∗ = 1; how-
ever, for m∗ = 10 and 100, there is a sharp decrease in
the amplitude of the transverse vibrations for U ∗ > 8. A
steady response is observed for U ∗ ≥ 11 at m∗ = 10 and
for U ∗ ≥ 10 at m∗ = 100.

Fig. 16 shows the frequency response of the ﬂuid-
structure system in terms of the dimensionless transverse
vibration frequency fy/fn and the dimensionless lift co-
eﬃcient frequency fCL /fn at Re = 40 for m∗ = 1, 10
and 100 with respect to U ∗. We show that for all three
mass ratios, there is a frequency match between the fre-
quency of the transverse vibrations fy, frequency of the
lift coeﬃcient fCL, and the ﬁrst-mode natural frequency
of the cylinder fn for a speciﬁc range of U ∗. This range

z -Vorticity :-5  -2.5  0  2.5  5is within U ∗ ∈ [8, 9] at m∗ = 100 and within U ∗ ∈ [7, 10]
at m∗ = 10. At m∗ = 1, the lock-in regime begins at
U ∗ = 6, however, the beam is shown to oscillate in fre-
quencies higher than its ﬁrst-mode natural frequency at
larger U ∗ values.

Based on our ﬁndings, we observe that by increasing
m∗, the range of the lock-in regime becomes narrower.
This behavior is because of stronger inertial coupling and
added mass eﬀects at lower mass ratios.
It should be
noted that for Reynolds numbers beyond Recr ≈ 45, in-
teractions between the unsteady wake and the cylinder
motion could lead to sustained vibrations for mass ratios
of O(100 − 1000), which are not examined in our current
work.

A qualitative representation of the cylinder motion tra-
jectory at z/L = 1 and Re = 40 with respect to U ∗ is
given in Fig. 17 for m∗ = 1, 10, and 100. We show that as
m∗ is increased, the motion trajectory of the cylinder in
the lock-in regime shifts from a ﬁgure-eight type response
at m∗ = 1 to a dominated motion in the transverse di-
rection at m∗ = 100.

To examine the wake structures in the lock-in regime
at diﬀerent mass ratios, we have provided the z-vorticity
iso-surfaces around the cylinder at Re = 40 and U ∗ = 8
for m∗ = 1, 10 and 100 in Fig. 18. We observe that for
all three m∗, two alternate vortices are shed from the
cylinder wake in each cycle. This ﬁnding suggests that
at a ﬁxed Re, the vortex shedding patterns in the wake
of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder are independent of the
mass ratio m∗.

Finally, we connect our ﬁndings to the dynamic re-
sponse of rat and seal whiskers in ﬂuid ﬂow. The pre-
sented results in this section for m∗ = 1 and 100 are
qualitative representatives of a seal and a rat whisker in
ﬂuid ﬂow, respectively. As mentioned in Section I, the in-
teraction of a rat’s whisker with low-speed airﬂow occurs
at Re < 50. Based on our results for the ﬂexible can-

tilever cylinder, a rat’s whisker at laminar subcritical Re
is expected to experience a VIV-galloping type instabil-
ity in the lock-in regime. In addition, ﬂutter instability
at reduced velocities of O(100) could appear in a rat’s
whisker, which requires further investigations.

For the case of a seal whisker in water ﬂow, we charac-
terize the oscillations as a VIV-dominant mechanism that
occurs due to interactions between the whisker and un-
steady wake at Re ≈ 1000. Our results for the dynamic
response of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder at m∗ = 1
could be used to interpret the response of a seal whisker
in low-speed laminar water ﬂows.

Based on the available data in the literature regard-
ing the amplitude response of an elastically mounted
rigid cylinder at laminar Re [15], we can deduce that
the amplitude response of the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder
at Re ≈ 1000 would be slightly higher than the values
presented in our current work. In addition, the vibration
amplitude of a seal whisker is predicted to be signiﬁcantly
lower than the vibration amplitude of the ﬂexible can-
tilever cylinder under similar conditions. Based on the
experiments by Refs [33, 47], lower amplitudes in a seal
whisker, compared to the ﬂexible cantilever cylinder, are
due to the seal whisker’s undulated geometry that helps
reduce the ﬂuid forces during VIVs.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have investigated the ﬂuid-structure
interaction of a ﬂexible cantilever cylinder at laminar
subcritical Re. Through numerical simulations, we as-
sessed the dynamic response of the cylinder as a function
of reduced velocity U ∗, for Reynolds numbers between
20 ≤ Re ≤ 40 and mass ratios between 1 ≤ m∗ ≤ 1000.
We found that for Re = 20, the ﬂexible cantilever cylin-

der remains in its steady deﬂected position for the whole
range of studied U ∗ and m∗. However, for 22 ≤ Re ≤ 40,
we observed that the cylinder experiences sustained oscil-
lations when certain conditions are satisﬁed. We showed
that the frequency of the transverse vibrations matches
the frequency of the periodic lift force during the oscil-
lations. Also, these two frequencies were found to be
approximately equal to the ﬁrst-mode natural frequency

of the cylinder for a particular range of U ∗. This spe-
ciﬁc range, known as the lock-in regime, was shown to
strongly depend on the Reynolds number Re and mass
ratio m∗; we found that at laminar subcritical Re, the
range of the lock-in regime decreases by increasing m∗,
whereas this range was shown to increase by increasing
Re. Finally, we identiﬁed two requirements for the wake
unsteadiness at laminar subcritical Re: (i) the ﬂow needs

zxyzxyzxyto have suﬃciently large inertia to overcome the viscous
damping, and (ii) the system parameters need to be in
the lock-in range. When these two conditions are satis-
ﬁed, the cylinder experiences a combined VIV-galloping
type instability. This instability was shown to break
the symmetry of the wake and lead to sustained large-
amplitude vibrations and unsteadiness in the wake at
laminar subcritical Re. We anticipate that the presented
systematic analysis can help improve our understanding
of the lock-in mechanism in ﬂexible cantilever structures.
Further research is required towards a parametric inves-
tigation of the dynamic response of the cylinder at high
reduced velocities of O(100), where potential ﬂutter-type
instabilities could be present.
In addition, the eﬀects
of structural nonlinearities should be accounted from a
practical viewpoint for diﬀerent ﬂow incidence with a

broader range of Re and U ∗ to fully understand the dy-
namic instabilities of the coupled system.
