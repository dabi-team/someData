We report up to ten-fold enhancement of the photoresponsivity of monolayer MoS2 by treatment
with O2:Ar (1:3) plasma. We characterize the surface of plasma-exposed MoS2 by TEM, Raman
and PL mapping and discuss the role of MoOx in improving the photocurrent generation in our
devices. At the highest tested laser power of 0.1 mW, we ﬁnd ten-fold enhancements to both the
output current and carrier ﬁeld-eﬀect mobility under the illumination wavelength of 488 nm. We
suggest that the improvement of electrical performance is due to the surface presence of MoOx
resulting from the chemical conversion of MoS2 by the oxygen-containing plasma. Our results
highlight the beneﬁcial role of plasma treatment as a fast and convenient way of improving the
properties of synthetic 2D MoS2 devices for future consideration in optoelectronics research.

Two-dimensional

layered transition metal dichalco-
genides (TMDs) have attracted wide research interest
due to their intriguing physical properties and potential
applications. Molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), a typical
layered TMD, is a semiconductor with a direct bandgap
of ∼ 1.8 eV in the single-layer limit [1]. This allows
monolayer MoS2 ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (FETs) to achieve
high ON/OFF ratios [2] (107-109), making them attrac-
tive candidates for switching components in future elec-
tronics. Recently, optoelectronic devices fabricated from
MoS2 have received notable attention [3–6]. MoS2 photo-
transistors are easy to fabricate, respond to a wide range
of wavelengths [3, 7], and exhibit fast DC photoresponses
[8, 9]. In addition, their photoresponsivity can be tuned
by various methods, such as back-gating [10, 11], encap-
sulation in HfO2 [12], strain engineering [13], layer decou-
pling [14] and evaporation of sub-stoichiometric molybde-
num oxide overlayers [15]. Surface sensitization of mono-
layer MoS2 FETs has also yielded signiﬁcant enhance-
ments of the measured photocurrent in the case of quan-
tum dots [16–18], organic molecules [19–21] and metal
nanostructures [22, 23]. However, these methods often
involve additional preparation steps in order to fabricate
the sensitizing species and deposit it on the MoS2 device.
Moreover, the surface-deposited dopants may not be ro-
bust to mechanical stressing or further material modiﬁ-
cation without losing their favorable properties.

Plasma functionalization, in turn, presents a fast and
facile way to alter the crystal structure of on-chip lay-
ered materials such as MoS2.
It facilitates large-scale,
multi-sample and rapid tuning of the optoelectronic per-
formance of FETs based on layered semiconductors.

In particular, oxygen-containing plasmas tend to form
sub-stoichiometric molybdenum oxides on the surface
of MoS2 [24–26]. These oxide centres can then act as
dopants that alter the charge concentration in the mod-
iﬁed MoS2 transistor channel
[27–29], and ultimately
govern the electron conduction behavior of the newly-

we demonstrate the enhancement of the photoresponsiv-
ity of chemical vapour deposition (CVD)-grown mono-
layer MoS2 by O2:Ar (1:3) plasma treatment. The pho-
toresponsivity is improved ten-fold in gated devices af-
ter 2 seconds of exposure to the plasma. At the same
time, the ﬁeld-eﬀect mobility of the device under illu-
mination improves by over one order of magnitude. We
carry out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imag-
ing and spectroscopic mapping to characterize the sam-
ple after plasma exposure, and attribute the observed
photoresponse to the suppressed charge recombination
mediated by surface-bound molybdenum oxides.

MoS2 samples were synthesized on SiO2/Si substrates
using the CVD method previously reported [31]. The
ﬂake thickness was conﬁrmed by optical microscopy and
Raman spectroscopy. Standard electron beam lithogra-
phy was carried out to fabricate the FET devices using
PMMA resist and development in MIBK:IPA (1:3) so-
lution. This was followed by metallization with Ti(10
nm)/Au(40 nm) contacts and lift-oﬀ in acetone. Plasma
treatment was carried out in a Fischione Instruments
1020 plasma cleaner for 2 seconds, utilizing O2:Ar (1:3)
gas at a chamber pressure of ∼ 5 mbar. The electrical
testing was performed at room temperature in a two-
probe conﬁguration (Imina miBot) using a source meter
unit (Agilent B2912A) in the ambient. The devices were
back-gated through the heavily p-doped Si substrate un-
derneath the 285 nm SiO2 overlayer. A 488 nm laser was
used for irradiation. Its power density was tuned at ﬁve

 
 
 
 
 
 
diﬀerent levels and controlled to ensure no power ﬂuctu-
ation throughout the experiment. The laser was directed
through a condenser lens (20×, NA = 0.4) and the spot
size was ≈ 1.5 µm. TEM was carried out in a FEI Titan
80-300 system operated at 300 kV, at a chamber pressure
of 4 × 10−7 mbar. Monolayer samples were transferred
onto copper TEM grids using the polymer stamp transfer
method [32]. Fabricated devices were imaged in a Zeiss
Nanofab helium ion microscope at a beam energy of 25
keV. Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were
acquired using a WITec Alpha 300R system (λ = 532
nm). Raman spectra were acquired using a spectral grat-
ing with 1800 lines/mm. PL spectra were collected using
a 600 lines/mm grating. A low laser power (< 100 µW)
was used during mapping to minimize any laser-induced
damage or heating of the sample.

Figure 1(a) is a false-color helium ion micrograph of
a typical contacted device. The contacts in our devices
were always deposited in a parallel geometry, as visible
in the image. The transistor channel length was over 5
µm to conﬁne the laser irradiation solely to the MoS2
region. This was done to avoid any heating eﬀects on
the metal/semiconductor interface which are known to
induce p-type doping in intrinsic n-type TMDs [33]. We
collected the output and transfer characteristics of the
device under 5 diﬀerent illumination powers. As the laser
spot avoided the Au electrodes during illumination, we
assume that all of the measured photo-generated current
originated in the MoS2 semiconductor.

Figure 1(b) shows the output characteristics of the de-
vice under laser illumination before any plasma treat-
ment. Prior to any exposure to the plasma, the low-bias
IV response of the MoS2 FET shows a well-behaved lin-
ear increase with applied bias for both voltage polari-
ties; indicating good ohmic contacts to the semiconduc-
tor. Upon successive irradiations with rising laser power,
the photocurrent increases, which is typical for semicon-
ducting monolayer MoS2 devices [3, 8, 10, 34–36]. The
output current reaches nearly 10 µA at ± 5 V at the
highest tested laser power of 72 µW. Figure 1(c) tracks
the IV curves after 2 seconds of exposure to the plasma.
We see that the current increases to nearly 25 µA at the
highest illumination power, compared with the untreated
sample at the same applied drain-source voltage. This in-
dicates that dopants introduced by the plasma treatment
to the MoS2 surface mediate an enhanced charge carrier
photo-generation response in the device.

Figure 2(a) shows the transfer curves for the same sam-
ple before any plasma treatment. Our as-grown devices
perform as standard n-type FETs with a ﬁeld-eﬀect mo-
bility (µ) of 0.13 cm2 V−1 s−1 under no illumination,
extracted in the linear region of the transfer curve and
at Vds = 1 V. Upon successive laser irradiations we ob-
serve a photogating eﬀect, whereby the threshold voltage
of the transistor shifts to negative gate biases by more
than 10 V due to increased electron doping. This has
previously been observed in ultrathin TMD FETs and is
attributed to the interaction of photo-generated carriers

with charge traps in the transistor channel [37, 38]. At
the highest incident power, the FET channel is eﬀectively
still open at Vg = - 60 V, where the output current stays
ﬁrmly above 10−7 A and leads to a large reduction in the
ON/OFF ratio of our device.

Figure 2(b) presents the gate curves after plasma treat-
ment. The observed level of output current in the dark
transfer curve drops two-fold when evaluated at the gate
bias, Vg = 60 V. Meanwhile, the threshold voltage is
seen to shift to more positive gate biases by ∼ 5 V. This
shift indicates oxygen-related p-type doping in the ma-
terial, consistent with previous works on oxygen plasma-

now possesses a weak ambipolar response,
indicating
hole-branch conduction caused by the likely presence of
plasma-created oxides [40, 41]. After 2 seconds of plasma
treatment, the output current in the saturation region of
the gate curve improves by one order of magnitude un-
der all illumination powers (note scale on the y-axis).

ity before and after chemical reaction with the plasma.
Even with no laser illumination, the mobility is seen to
improve two-fold in the plasma-treated samples, which
we have explored in previous work [28]. After 2 seconds

of exposure, the carrier mobility increases over ten-fold
as the laser power is turned up. We ﬁnd no clear re-
lationship between the mobility and the laser power for
the untreated sample. However, we obtain a good power
law ﬁt to the mobility scaling as µ ∝ P 0.64 above laser
powers of 10−3 mW. Similarly, in Fig. 2(d), the out-
put current at Vg = 60 V is seen to improve once the
device is exposed to the plasma. In both the untreated
and treated case, the dependence of the photocurrent on
the laser power is sublinear, though the power law re-
sponse is enhanced by plasma treatment from µ ∝ P 0.13
to µ ∝ P 0.29. The scaling exponent in this relationship
depends on the charge trapping rate in the MoS2 FET
channel [34, 42]. Our results suggest that the presence
of plasma-created oxides on the surface inhibits photo-
generated pair recombination via defect sites. We extract
both data sets at Vg = 60 V where the FET is moving
into depletion, i.e.: the majority carrier concentration in
MoS2 induced by gating begins to approach that of the
photogenerated carrier density [43]. The slope of the ﬁt
to the photocurrent as a function of laser power serves
as a measure of the photogating eﬀect seen in the power-
graded transfer curves in Figs. 2(a),(b). An increase in
the slope after plasma treatment is a direct consequence

of the additional charge present in the device.

We plot the DC photoresponsivity, Rph, at diﬀerent
gate biases as a function of irradiation power in Figure
3. Rph is the current generated in the device per unit of
laser power and is a crucial parameter that quantiﬁes the
sensitivity of photodetectors [37]. We obtain good linear
ﬁts of Rph as a function of power, P , across the whole
gate bias range, before and after plasma treatment. The
negative slope in the log-log plot indicates the saturation
of trap states in the material with increasing incident op-
tical power [3, 7, 44]. In Fig. 3(a), we see the 0 V and
60 V gate bias trends exhibiting similar levels of Rph, es-
pecially at higher laser powers. Upon plasma treatment,
in Fig. 3(b), we observe an enhancement of Rph for all
tested gate biases and a notable separation of the respon-
sivity as a function of Vg. As Vg is increased, the device
becomes more responsive to laser illumination. The tem-
poral response of the device pre- and post-plasma treat-
ment is charted in Fig. 3(c). The photocurrent is seen
to improve two-fold for the tested device when the laser
irradiation is modulated through 5 s on/oﬀ cycles at a
power of 36 µW and Vds = 5 V. The post-sensitization
fall (τf all) and rise (τrise) times are extracted from single
exponential ﬁts in Figs. 3(d) and 3(e) respectively. The
time-resolved photoresponses compare favorably with the
evaporated MoOx overlayer report [15], where our rise
time at a much lower irradiation power is 35% shorter.

MoS2/MoOx interface [15]. The electron aﬃnity and
bandgap of monolayer MoS2 are ∼ 4.3 eV and 1.8 eV
respectively [1, 47]. After the rapid plasma treatment,
MoOx is generated on the device surface as demonstrated
in the previous discussion. Oxides of molybdenum are
commonly known as high work function materials (6.8
eV) with a bandgap of 3 eV [15, 48].
In this device,
plasma-generated oxides and unreacted MoS2 will form
an eﬀective medium that spans the FET channel. As the
Fermi level of MoS2 is higher than that of MoOx, signif-
icant band bending will occur at the interface [15]. The
built-in electric ﬁeld gradient will be directed from MoS2
towards the oxide. Photo-generated holes will then be-
come trapped at the material interface, inhibiting recom-
bination and thereby enhancing the photocurrent with
electrons as majority carriers. This is also supported by
the observed photogating eﬀect mediated by the electron-
rich surface overlayer. The improved responsivity at
higher back-gate ﬁelds is a direct consequence of Fermi
level alignment which also facilitates easier photocarrier
injection into the contacts [4, 10, 12] and primes the de-
vice for photon detection levels exceeding those of the
pristine MoS2.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the photore-
sponsivity of MoS2 monolayer FETs can be enhanced
ten-fold by the introduction of surface-bound molybde-
num oxides. We conﬁrm their presence via TEM, Raman
and PL spectroscopy. The eﬀect of the mobility and pho-
toresponsivity enhancement depends on laser power and
is more prominent at powers exceeding several µWatts.
Our work provides insight into heterostructure physics in

Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) are included as insets.
A large change in local contrast on some ﬂake areas can
be noted after 2 s of exposure to the plasma. It is ev-
ident from the TEM observation that after the plasma
treatment, an amorphous oxide of molybdenum builds
up on the surface as a consequence of a chemical reac-
tion between the ﬂake and the plasma-created species
[26, 28, 45]. Spectroscopic mapping of the samples al-
lows for a closer inspection of the chemical state of the
MoS2 surface pre- and post-plasma treatment. Figures
6(a), (b) show the spatially-resolved Raman maps of the
material corresponding to the in-plane vibrational mode
at 385 cm−1. We notice a drastic drop in the intensity
of the signal at this frequency, indicating a change in the
MoS2 lattice which alters the Raman-active modes in the
sample. The ﬂake-averaged spectra are presented in Fig.
6(c), demonstrating the quenching eﬀect of plasma treat-
ment on the monolayer MoS2 Raman peaks.

From the spectral component ﬁts (see Supplementary
Table 1), the monolayer nature of the sample is conﬁrmed
with a wavenumber separation of 20.5 cm−1 between the
A
peaks [46]. Upon plasma treatment, the in-
tensity of both Raman modes is severely reduced after
2 seconds of exposure, while peak position also shifts
and the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) increases.

Both the downshift of the E
peak and upshift of the A
1
peak are consistent with reports on molybdenum oxide
formation on MoS2, as is the asymmetric broadening of
both peaks [26–28]. PL maps of the neutral A exciton
emission (1.84 eV) of the same ﬂake are presented before
and after 2 seconds of plasma treatment in Figs. 6(d), (e).
Accompanying spectra averaged across the whole sample
are shown in Fig. 6(f). We observe signiﬁcant quenching
of direct excitonic recombination in the sample after the
plasma introduces the oxide species on the surface. The
emission is also largely blue-shifted to higher energies by
∼ 0.1 eV. These observations are also in line with previ-
