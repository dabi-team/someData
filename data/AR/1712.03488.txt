ABSTRACT

AR Scorpii is an intermediate polar system composed of a magnetic white
dwarf (WD) and an M-type star, and shows non-thermal, pulsed, and highly
linearly polarized emission. The radio/optical emission modulates with the WD’s
spin and show the double peak structure in the light curves. In this paper, we
discuss a possible scenario for the radiation mechanism of AR Scorpii. The
magnetic interaction on the surface of the companion star produces an outﬂow
from the companion star, the heating of the companion star surface, and the
acceleration of electrons to a relativistic energy. The accelerated electrons, whose
typical Lorentz factor is
100, from the companion star move along the
magnetic ﬁeld lines toward the WD surface. The electrons injected with the pitch
angle of sin θp,0 > 0.05 are subject to the magnetic mirror eﬀect and are trapped
in the closed magnetic ﬁeld line region.We ﬁnd that the emission from the ﬁrst
magnetic mirror points mainly contributes to the observed pulsed emission and
the formation of the double-peak structure in the light curve. For the inclined
rotator, the pulse peak in the calculated light curve shifts the position in the
spin phase, and a Fourier analysis exhibits a beat frequency feature, which are
consistent with the optical/UV observations. The pulse proﬁle also evolves with
the orbital phase owing to the eﬀect of the viewing geometry. The model also
interprets the global features of the observed spectral energy distribution in radio
to X-ray energy bands. We also discuss the curvature radiation and the inverse-
Compton scattering process in the outer gap accelerator of the WD in AR Scorpii
and discuss the possibility of the detection by future high-energy missions.

Introduction

White dwarf (hereafter WD) is the end point of the stellar evolution of a progenitor with
8M⊙, and for over 97% of all stars. There are WDs with a strong magnetic
a mass of M
≤
109G, which has been determined by the polarization and/or
ﬁeld in the range of Bs ∼
Zeeman splitting, and the WD belonging to this class is called a magnetic WD (Ferrario et
al. 2015). The ﬁrst magnetic WD, Grw+70◦8247 with Bs = 100
300MG, was reported
in the 1970s (Kemp et al. 1970; Angel et l. 1985), and it is located about 13pc (43 lt-yr)
away. The number of the magnetic WDs is rapidly increased by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS; York et al. 2000; Kepler et al. 2013). The WD catalog based on the SDSS DR7 (c.f.
12831 is the hydrogen atmosphere
Kleinman et al. 2013) includes 19713 WDs, in which
WD (called DAs). Among the DAs listed in SDSS-DR7, Kepler et al. (2013) measured the
Zeeman splitting from
4% (521) of all DAs observed and estimated the surface magnetic
ﬁeld at Bs = 1
700MG. In the SDSS DR10, Kepler et al. (2015) discovered 9089 new
WDs, including 206 magnetic WDs. Although the volume density of magnetic WDs is still
10% of the WDs are magnetic WDs (Sion
unknown, these observations would suggest that 5
10−3pc−3 by
et al. 2014; Kepler et al 2015). The space density of the WDs estimated as 5
the direct measurement of local WDs (Holberg 2002 and references therein) suggests that a
large number of the magnetic WDs are existing in the galaxy.

A magnetic WD is observed as an isolated system or a binary system, and the highly
magnetic WD is found in the binary system, which is known as cataclysmic variable (here-
after CV). The CVs usually accrete matter on the WDs from the late-type main-sequence
20% of all CVs
companion through Roche lobe overﬂow, and the magnetic CVs comprose
(
1100 CVs; Ritter & Kolb 2010). The magnetic CV is mainly divided into two groups, that
∼
is, polar and intermediate polar system (IP). The WD of the polar has a surface magnetic
ﬁeld of Bs > 10MG, which is suﬃciently large to lock the two stars into synchronous rotation
with the orbital period (Pobs ∼
500minutes, Ferrario et al. 2015). The WD in the IP
has a smaller surface magnetic ﬁeld Bs ∼
10MG than that in the polar. The magnetic
−
ﬁeld of WDs is not suﬃcient to lock the companion into the synchronous rotation, and the
spin of the WD is observed with a shorter period than the orbital period. Both polars and
IPs emit X-rays owing to accretion of the matter from the companion on the WD’s surface.

Since the synchronous rotation of two stars in polar, there is no angular momentum of
the accreting matter relative to the WD, and the formation of the accretion disk is prevented.
For the IPs, the accretion disk can present, and the angular momentum transfer by the disk
matter will spin up the magnetic WD. The accretion process on the compact object is
discussed with the so-called co-rotation radius, rco = (GMW DP 2
W D/4π2)1/3, where the WD’s
spin frequency is equal to the disk rotation frequency (Keplerian frequency), and the Alfven

Some WDs in the IPs are rapidly rotating with a period PW D < 100s (Ferrario et al.
2015, and reference therein): PW D = 33.1s for AE Aquarii (AE Aqr), 70.8s for DQ Her,
and 67.6s for V455 And. For those magnetic WDs, an accretion rate close to the Eddington
1020g/s is necessary to satisfy the condition (rM < rc) for the formation of the
rate ˙ME ∼
accretion disk. However, the time-averaged rate of the mass transfer from the companion
is observed with ˙M16 = 1
100 (Patterson 1994) for those systems, suggesting that these
systems will not contain the disk, and probably the matter from Roche lobe directly streams
toward the WD surface, or most of the matter from the companion is centrifugally ejected
(propeller phase). In fact, the Doppler tomography proﬁle of the AE Aqr (e.g. Wynn et al.
1997) indicates that the AE Aqr is in the propeller phase (Ikhsanov et al. 2004). Moreover,
the pulse timing study of the AE Aqr revealed that the WD is spinning down at a rate
10−14 (de Jager et al. 1994), corresponding to a spin-down luminosity
5.64
of
1033I50erg/s, where I50 is the WD’s moment of inertia
of Lsd = I(2π)2 ˙PW D/P 3
in units of 1050g cm2. Because of the low mass accretion rate with the high spin-down
rate, the AE Aqr has been considered as the ﬁrst WD pulsar candidate that operates the
mechanisms of the neutron star (NS) pulsar-like particle acceleration and the non-thermal
radiation process in the magnetosphere.

The mechanism of the NS pulsar-like particle acceleration in the magnetosphere of the
magnetic WD has been discussed by several authors (Usov 1988; Ikhsanov 1998; Kashiyama
et al. 2011). In the model, an electron (or a positron) that emerged from the polar cap
region is accelerated by an electric ﬁeld parallel to the open magnetic ﬁeld lines. The electric
potential diﬀerence across the open ﬁeld lines is estimated by

electrons and positrons. Although very high energy emission (de Jager 1994) and nonthermal
X-ray emission (Terada et al. 2008) from AE Aqr were reported, the observational view on
the WD pulsar has not been ﬁrmly established. In section 4, we will discuss the NS pulsar-like

0.3M⊙ and R2

New discovery of the pulsed radio/optical/UV emission from AR Scorpii (hereafter
AR Sco) sheds light on the nonthermal nature of the magnetic WD (Marsh et al. 2016).
3.56hr, and it is composed of an M star
AR Sco is the IP with an orbital period of Po ∼
0.3R⊙) and a magnetic WD. The interesting properties of the
(M2
∼
emission from AR Sco are the nonthermal, pulsed, and highly linearly polarized emission.
The radio/optical/UV emission modulates periodically on a period of P
1.97minutes,
which is thought to be the spin period of the magnetic WD. The double-peak structure of
the pulse proﬁle and the morphology of the linear polarization (Buckely et al. 2017) in the
optical bands are resemble to those of the Crab pulsar, which is the isolated young NS pulsar
and emits the electromagnetic waves in radio to high-energy TeV bands (Kuiper et al. 2001;
Kanbach et al. 2005; Takata et al. 2007). Moreover, the optical emission also modulates on
the orbital period (3.56hr), which will reﬂect the heating of the dayside of the companion
star by the interaction of the magnetic ﬁeld/radiation by the WD. The modulation of the
optical emission from the companion star with the orbital motion is also similar to that of
the millisecond NS pulsar/low-mass star binary system (Fruchter et al. 1988; Kong et al.
2012).

∼

AR Sco’s broadband electromagnetic spectrum in radio to X-ray bands is characterized
by the synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons, indicating the acceleration pro-
cess in the magnetosphere of the WD. As pointed out by Geng et al. (2016), on the other
hand, the number of the particles that emit the observed nonthermal optical emission of
AR Sco is signiﬁcantly larger than the number that can be supplied by the WD itself. This
suggests that the synchrotron-emitting electrons are supplied from the companion star’s sur-
face, and the acceleration process is diﬀerent from that of the NS pulsar. Geng et al. (2016)
suggested an electron/position beam from the WD’s polar cap sweeping the stellar wind from
the companion star, and a bow shock propagating into stellar wind accelerates the electrons
in the wind.

Geng et al. (2016) discussed the emission due to the interaction between the companion
star and the WD’s open magnetic ﬁeld lines that extend beyond the light cylinder (̟lc =
1011cm), and hence assumed that the WD is a nearly perpendicular rotator. In this
5.6

– 5 –

paper, we investigate another possibility that the electrons accelerated around the companion
stellar surface are trapped by the close magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD. The injected electrons
from the stellar surface are accelerated at the vicinity of the companion star and initially
travel toward the WD’s surface along the magnetic ﬁeld line. We will solve the evolution
of the pitch angle of such electrons under the eﬀects of the synchrotron radiation energy-
loss and the ﬁrst adiabatic invariance.
In section 2, we will describe our model and the
basic equation for the motion of the trapped electrons. We also discuss the direction of the
emission by the relativistic electrons to calculate the light curve. In section 3, we will show
our results and discuss the mirror eﬀect of the electron’s motion. We al show the model
pulse proﬁle in optical and X-ray bands. In section 4, we discuss the particle acceleration
and the high-energy emission from the outer gap accelerator of the WD in AR Sco and will
calculate the expected ﬂuxes of the curvature radiation process and the inverse-Compton
scattering (hereafter IC) process.

In this section, we will discuss the emission model for the observed radio/optical/X-ray
emission from AR Sco. The WD’s magnetic ﬁeld lines sweep periodically across the surface
of the companion star. The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD at the surface of the
companion star will be of the order of

magnetic reconnection or ohmic dissipation, and the dissipated magnetic energy will be used
for (1) the heating of the M star surface, (2) acceleration of the electrons, and (3) outﬂow

The magnetic interaction on the companion surface may eventually cause an ablation
of the matter from the M star surface and an acceleration of the electrons to the relativistic
energy. The ablation of the companion star by the WD magnetic ﬁeld could occur if the
binary is close enough so that an energy deposition on the envelope of the stellar surface is
high. The ablation of the companion star by the deposition of the electromagnetic energy
is a common process for the millisecond NS pulsar and low-mass companion star binary,
which is called as black widow/redback pulsars (Roberts 2013). In the black widow/redback
systems, it has been observed that most of the deposited energy on the stellar surface is
converted into the heating of the companion star surface and/or the nonthermal radiation
process, and a tiny fraction (0.1-1%) of it is used for the ablation of the matter from the
companion star (van den Heuvel & Paradijs 1988; Cheng 1989). Since the mass loss driven
by the irradiation from the compact star has not been well understood, we introduce the
eﬃciency factor χ for converting the dissipated energy into the kinetic energy of the wind,

As we discuss above, the magnetic interaction between the closed magnetic ﬁeld of the WD
and the companion star will produce the pitch δBφ/B

magnetic reconnection/dissipation, which accelerates the electrons. After sweeping across
the companion star surface, the magnetic ﬁeld line of the WD will remain to be closed, and
the injected electrons may be trapped at the closed magnetic ﬁeld lines by the magnetic
mirror eﬀect. Since the radius of the gyration motion of an electron is much smaller than

2.4. Radiation direction

To investigate the expected modulation of the observed emission with the WD’s spin, we
calculate the propagation direction and the time of arrival (TOA) of each emitted photon.
For the coordinate system, we introduce the z-axis at the spin axis of the WD and also
assume that the spin axis of the WD and orbital axis are aligned for simplicity. The x-
axis is chosen so that the observer is located at the ﬁrst quadrant in the (x, z) coordinate
(Figure 1). The direction of the magnetic momentum ~µW D (the magnetic axis) is inclined
by α from the z-axis, and it is rotating around the z-axis.

For a high Lorentz factor, we can anticipate that the emission direction of the particles
coincides with the direction of the particle’s velocity. In the laboratory frame, the unit vector
of the electron motion that is co-rotating with the WD may be described by (Takata et al.
2007)

~ne = β0 cos θp~b + β0 sin θp~b⊥ + βco~eφ,

(16)

where the ﬁrst, second, and third terms on the right-hand side represent the motion along
the magnetic ﬁeld line, the gyration motion, and the co-rotation motion, respectively. The
value of the parallel speed β0 in equation (16) at each point is calculated from the conditions
= 1 and βco = ̟/̟lc, where ̟ is the axial distance from the spin axis of the WD.

The emission direction of equation (16) is interpreted as the angle measured from the
rotation axis, ζ = cos−1 ne,z, where ne,z is the component of the emission direction along the
rotation axis and the azimuthal angle φ measured from the x-axis. Since the observer is laid
on the ﬁrst quadrant of the plane made by the x-axis and z-axis (Figure 1), we pick up the
photon traveling in the direction φ = 0 to calculate the pulse proﬁle.

that the second term on the right-hand side does not appear if the high-energy electrons

3. Results

We treat the companion star as the point object located at r = a = 8

1010cm and on
the equator of the WD, for simplicity. This may be a rough treatment for this system, since
the size of the companion star is not negligible compared to the size of the orbital separation.
However, we expect that the main results discussed in this paper will not be modiﬁed even
if we take into account the size of the companion star. Under this assumption, we evaluate
the magnetic energy dissipation and the injection of the electrons at the companion star.

The top panel of Figure 2 shows the evolution of the Lorentz factor as a function of the

radial distance and indicates that the injected electron is trapped at
a, the synchrotron cooling time scale is longer
the magnetic mirror eﬀect. At around r
a/c, and the electron migrates toward the WD with an
than the dynamical time scale
almost constant Lorentz factor. As the dotted line in the bottom panel of Figure 2 shows, the
perpendicular momentum P⊥ increases with a time owing to the ﬁrst adiabatic invariance.
Around the magnetic mirror point, where the pitch angle becomes sin θp ∼
1, the synchrotron
energy-loss increases, and it rapidly decreases the Lorentz factor. After the magnetic mirror,
the electron moves toward the outer magnetosphere with the synchrotron loss time scale
longer than the dynamical time scale, and hence the Lorentz factor is almost constant.
Since the electron travels on the closed magnetic ﬁeld lines, it eventually moves toward
WD’s surface in another hemisphere and is reﬂected back again by the magnetic mirror. As
Figure 2 indicates, most of the initial energy of the electron injected with sin θp,0 = 0.1 is
lost by the synchrotron radiation at the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point.

For the smaller initial pitch angle of sin θp,0 = 0.05 in Figure 3, the electrons can enter
the inner magnetosphere, and the stronger synchrotron energy-loss prevents the magnetic
mirror. The top left panel of Figure 4 represents the evolution of the Lorentz factor as
a function of the time from the injection. The ﬁgure indicates that the electron injected
with the small pitch angle of sin θp,0 = 0.1 (solid line) radiates away all the initial energy
within a timescale less than the spin period, while for the electron with a larger pitch angle
sin θp,0 = 0.2 (dashed line) and 0.5 (dotted line), the energy-loss time scale is longer than
the spin period of the WD.

3.2. Formation of the pulse

Figure 4 shows the sky map of the angle (ζ) and the spin phase (Φ) for the emission
from the electron injected at Φ0 = 0 with the Lorentz factor γ0 = 50 and the pitch angle
sin θp,0 = 0.1 (top right), 0.2 (bottom left), and 0.5 (bottom right); the brightness of the
color in the ﬁgure refers the observed intensity. With γ0 = 50, the electrons injected with
sin θp,0
0.1 are subjected to the magnetic mirror, as the top left panel of Figure 4 indicates,
and the synchrotron energy-loss mainly occurs at the magnetic mirror point. Around the
magnetic mirror point, the pitch angle of the electron is increased to 90 degree, and the
gyration motion produces the synchrotron beam that covers the large region in the angle ζ,
as we can see in Figure 4.

As we can also see in Figure 4, the sky map of the observed emission from one electron
depends on the initial pitch angle. For the injected electron with sin θp,0 = 0.1 (see top right

from all gyration phases is included.

panel), since the most of the electron’s energy is radiated away at the ﬁrst magnetic mirror
point, and the synchrotron emission at subsequent magnetic mirror points is negligible. As
a result, the emission from this electron can be mainly observed at narrow spin phase width.
For sin θp,0 = 0.2 (bottom left panel), the magnetic mirror point is located outside of that
for sin θp,0 = 0.1, and hence the synchrotron energy-loss at the ﬁrst magnetic mirror is less
than that for sin θp,0 = 0.1. As we can see, however, the emissivity at the ﬁrst magnetic
mirror point is still much higher than the emissivity at subsequent mirror points. In our
model, therefore, the emission at the ﬁrst mirror point provides the most contribution on
the observed emission from the AR Sco.

∼

For the larger pitch angle with sin θp,0 = 0.5 (bottom right panel), the electron is trapped
at r
a and the time scale of synchrotron energy-loss is much longer than the spin period,
as the dotted line in the top left panel shows. The emission from this electron covers almost
the whole sky, and it may be observed as a nonpulsed emission. Moreover, such an electron
whose cooling time scale is longer than the spin period will be absorbed by the companion
star after one rotation of the WD and will not contribute much to the observed emission.

Since the WD is spinning, the electrons will be injected on the diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld
lines at the diﬀerent spin phases, that is, Φ0 in equation (18). We integrate the emission
from all magnetic ﬁeld lines to compare with the observations. As we discussed above, the
emission from the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point of the injected electron mainly contributes to

 
 
 
 
 
 
– 17 –

the observation. In such a situation, we ﬁnd that the structure of the pulse proﬁle mainly
depends on how the spin phase of the detected photon (Φ in equation (18)) is related to the
injected phase Φ0. If the phase of the detection Φ monotonically shifts with the phase of
injection Φ0, the predicted pulse proﬁle does not signiﬁcantly modulate with the spin period.
For example, the left panel in Figure 5 shows such a relation calculated with the magnetic
inclination α = 0◦ and the magnetic gyration phase δφg in equation (17); the small window
in the ﬁgure shows the sky map of Φ and ζ with the contribution from the whole gyration
phase. Because of the rotation axisymmetric geometry of the magnetic ﬁeld lines for α = 0◦,
the observed phase Φ monotonically shifts with the injected phase Φ0, as the ﬁgure shows.
As a result, the observed intensity for α = 0◦ is the constant with the time for any viewing
angle ζ.

For a large inclined rotator (α = 60◦), the phase Φ of the detected photon from the ﬁrst
mirror point does not monotonically shift with the phase of the injection Φ0, as the line in
the right panel of Figure 5 indicates. We can see in the ﬁgure that the photons emitted at the
ﬁrst mirror point by the electrons injected at 0 < Φ0 < 0.2 are observed at a narrower width

observer with an appropriate viewing angle ζ will measure a signiﬁcant modulation of the
emission with the spin period of the WD.

The concentration of the detected photons at the narrower spin phase for the larger
inclination angle can be understood as follows. In the present calculation for Figure 5, we
inject the electron into the southern hemisphere of the WD’s magnetosphere (Figure 1). At
the companion star, the radial direction of the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD depends on the
spin phase. For example, the radial direction at Φ0 = 0 (the magnetic axis points toward
the companion) points to the outer magnetosphere, while at Φ0 = 0.5 it is directed toward
0, it initially moves
the inner magnetosphere (Figure 1). For the electron injected at Φ0
toward the light cylinder and returns to the inner magnetosphere along the closed magnetic
ﬁeld line, and therefore it takes a longer time, after the injection, to reach the ﬁrst magnetic
mirror point than the electron that is injected at a later time (Φ0 > 0). This diﬀerence in
the travel time to the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point causes an enhancement of the observed
emission at the speciﬁc spin phase. As we can see in the Figure 5, the emission from the
half-hemisphere makes one high-intensity region in the sky map. As we expect, therefore,
the contribution from the opposite hemisphere creates another high-intensity region, which

separates
in the sky map will measure the double-peak structure in the light curve.

3.3. Application to AR Scorpii

3.3.1. Parameters and assumptions

To apply the model to AR Sco, we assume that the magnetic interaction at the compan-
ion star injects the same number of the electrons at the northern and southern hemispheres
1034G cm3, η = 1,
from the equator of the WD. We represent the results with µW D = 6.5
and δ = 0.01 in equation (4) and the eﬃciency χ = 10−5 deﬁned in equation (5). We ﬁt
the SED of the AR Sco with p = 2.5. With these parameters, the minimum and maximum

Lorentz factors are estimated as γmin ∼
tant parameters are the inclination angle α and the viewing angle ζ that aﬀect the predicted
pulse proﬁle. As we have assumed, the spin axis of the WD is perpendicular to the orbital
plane, and the WD is rotating in the same sense as the binary orbit of the companion.

As we discussed in section 3.1, the evolution of the Lorentz factor and the perpendicular
momentum of the injected electrons depend on the initial pitch angle. The distribution of
the pitch angle of the particles for diﬀerent acceleration processes has been investigated by
the previous authors (Achterberg et al. 2001; Kartavykh et al. 2016), but it is still under
investigation with a more realistic situation. In this study, therefore, we assume an isotropic
distribution in the initial pitch angle θp,0, that is,

d ˙Ne
dθp,0

= constant.

We note that, in our model, the electrons that are trapped at the close magnetic ﬁeld line
by the magnetic mirror are eventually absorbed by the companion stellar surface after one
rotation of the WD. In the calculation, we do not take into account the synchrotron self-
absorption, which may be important for the radio band (Geng et al. 2016).

3.3.2. Pulse proﬁle

Figures 6 and 7 summarize the predicted pulse proﬁles in optical (0.3-1eV) and X-ray
(1keV-10keV) energy bands, respectively, at the inferior conjunction of the companion orbit,
where the companion star is between the WD and the observer; each panel shows the pulse
proﬁle as a function of the magnetic inclination α and the Earth viewing angle ζ. In addition,
the each panel shows the pulse proﬁle in the two spin phases of the WD with normalized
intensity, and the phase zero (and unity) corresponds to the time when the magnetic axis
points toward the observer (Figure 1).

We ﬁnd that the model with a smaller viewing angle predicts a single pulse proﬁle in the

optical emission, as Figure 6 indicates. For the smaller inclination angle, the observer misses
the emission from the half-hemisphere. The optical/UV emission from AR Sco has been
observed as the pulsed emission with the sharp double-peak structure in the light curve.
In the current model, the double-peak structure can be produced for a larger magnetic
inclination and a larger Earth viewing angle. We note that a larger viewing angle of the
AR Sco is expected by the observed orbital modulation of the optical emission from the
companion star and by a large amplitude of the modulation.

By comparing between Figures 6 and 7, we ﬁnd that the predicted X-ray pulse is broader
and the light-curve structure is more complicate in comparison with the optical light curve.
In the current model, the X-rays are produced by the Lorentz factor of γ > 104, for which the
synchrotron cooling time scale is comparable to or shorter than the crossing time scale. Un-
like the optical emission, therefore, the emission region is not restricted at the ﬁrst magnetic
mirror, but it spreads to a wide space in the WD’s magnetosphere.

3.3.3. Orbital evolution of the pulse proﬁle

As we discussed in section 3.2, the pulse peaks are mainly made by the emission of the
electrons injected when the magnetic axis of the WD is laid within the plane made by the
WD’s spin axis and the companion star. Because of the orbital motion of the companion,
therefore, the spin phase of the pulse shifts with the orbital phase. The pulse proﬁle presented
in Figures 6 and 7 assumes the geometry in which the companion star is located at the
inferior conjunction of the companion orbit, where the companion is between the WD and
the observer. Figure 8 compares the pulse proﬁles of the optical emission at the inferior
conjunction, descending node, superior conjunction, and ascending node, respectively, of the
companion orbit. The phase zero in all panels corresponds to the time when the magnetic
axis points toward the observer. We can see the shift of the pulse peaks and the evolution of
the peak intensity with the orbital motion of the companion. We can also see the evolution
of the pulse proﬁle along the orbit.

By assuming that the WD is rotating in the same sense as the binary orbit of the com-
panion, we make the time sequence of the calculated intensity for about one orbit and perform
the Fourier analysis of it. Figure 9 shows the power spectrum for the global frequency (top
left), around the fundamental frequency (top right), around the second harmonic frequency
(bottom left), and around the third harmonic frequency (bottom right). In the ﬁgure, we can
see the peak of the power spectrum around the beat frequency νB = (1/117s

0.0085Hz and its harmonics, reﬂecting that the pulse peak monotonically shifts along the
orbit. In the ﬁgure, we also see that the ﬁrst harmonic frequency has a stronger power, since

the pulse proﬁle has a double-peak structure. These results are consistent with the power
spectrum of the optical observations (Marsh et al.2016).

Marsh et al. (2016) reported no signiﬁcant detection of the pulsed emission in the X-ray
bands. It could be due to the shift of the pulse peak with the orbital phase, since the current
X-ray instruments cannot resolve the individual pulses of the AR Sco. The time-averaged
light curve will be no pulsation or a modulation with a small pulse fraction. We may need
a detailed analysis for the timing of arrival of each X-ray photon to detect the pulsation.

3.3.4. Spectrum

Finally, Figure 10 compares the observed SED (Marsh et al. 2016) and model calcu-
lations for the diﬀerent inclination angles: α = 20◦ (solid), 40◦ (dashed), 60◦ (dot-dashed)
and 80◦ (dotted), respectively. In addition, we assume a power-law index of p = 2.5 of the
injected electrons to explain the broadband spectrum. We take into account the emission
of each injected electron up to t = P (one rotation), since the injected electron may be
absorbed by the companion star after one rotation of the WD. We can see that the model

interprets the global features of the observed SED with the spectral peak at
0.1
1eV, the model ﬂux is smaller than the observed ﬂux. This is because the emission
from the companion star contributes to the observed ﬂux in this energy band. In the ﬁgure,
we can see that the diﬀerent inclination angle predicts a slightly diﬀerent model spectrum;
the SED of the larger inclination angle has a spectral peak at higher energy. This is because
the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld at the ﬁrst magnetic mirror point tends to be higher for
larger inclination angle. We note that the model SED is insensitive to the viewing angle ζ,
because the radiation beam from each electron at the mirror point covers a large region in
the angle ζ, as Figure 4 shows.

4. Discussion

No concrete evidence of the accretion onto the WD in AR Sco has been found, and it
is considered that the system is now in the propeller phase (Beskrovnaya & Ikhsanov 2017).
Hence, if there is no ﬂow of accretion matter from the companion star on the open magnetic
ﬁeld line region, the WD could operate the mechanisms of the neutron star (NS) pulsar-like
particle acceleration and the nonthermal radiation process in the magnetosphere.
In this

For the NS pulsar, the IC loss in the outer gap is negligible, and the electric force is
immediately balanced with the radiation drag force of the curvature radiation. The saturated

when the IC process is the main energy-loss. Since fgap should be less than unity, no
saturation motion in the our gap accelerator will be realized for the WD in the AR Sco.

For the NS pulsar, the fractional gap thickness will be determined by the pair-creation
process between the gamma rays from the curvature radiation process and the background
X-ray from the stellar surface (Takata et al. 2012). For the WD pulsar, on other hand, the
fractional gap thickness could be determined by the photon-photon pair creation process of
the TeV photon from the IC process. The optical depth of the TeV photon is estimated
σT /3 is the cross section of the

pair-creation and nopt is the number density of the
1eV photon around the light cylinder.
For the WD in AR Sco, the fractional gap thickness fgap ∼
1 is required to produce TeV
photons in the outer gap (Figure 12). If a part of the open ﬁeld line region is occupied by
the matter from the companion star, the possible fractional gap thickness is less than unity.
Because of the theoretical uncertainties, we parameterize the fractional gap thickness in this
section.

In summary, we discussed the radio/optical/X-ray emission from AR Sco. In our model,
the magnetic dissipation process on the M star surface produces (i) an outﬂow from the
companion star, (ii) heating of the companion star surface, and (iii) acceleration of the
electron to relativistic energy. The accelerated electrons, whose typical Lorentz factor is
γ0
50, are trapped in the close magnetic ﬁeld lines. We solved the motion of the trapped
electrons along the magnetic ﬁeld under the eﬀects of the synchrotron loss and the ﬁrst
adiabatic invariance. We found that the electron injected toward the WD’s surface with a
0.05 is trapped at the closed magnetic ﬁeld lines by the magnetic
pitch angle of sin θp,0
mirror eﬀect. For such an electron, most of the initial energy is released at the ﬁrst mirror
point by the synchrotron radiation process. We demonstrated that for the inclined rotator
with the dipole magnetic ﬁeld, the synchrotron emission from the trapped electrons injected
at the diﬀerent spin phase can create the light curve with a double-peak structure, which is
consistent with the observations. The model expects that the pulse proﬁle is linearly shifts
with the orbital phase, and this shift is observed as the beat frequency in the spectral power
of the Fourier analysis. The model interprets the global features of the observed SED in
radio to X-ray energy bands. We discussed the curvature radiation and the IC process in
the outer gap accelerator of the WD in AR Sco. The curvature radiation from the outer gap
could be measured by the future hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, if the gap fraction
is fgap > 0.7. The TeV emission via the IC process from AR Sco may be also detected by
the future CTA project.
