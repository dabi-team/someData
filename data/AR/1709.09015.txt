The peculiar electron dispersion in Dirac materials makes lowest-order Auger processes prohibited or
marginally prohibited by energy and momentum conservation laws. Thus, Auger recombination (AR) in these
materials is very sensitive to many-body eﬀects. We incorporate them at the level of the GW approximation
into the nonequilibrium Green’s functions approach to AR and study the role of dynamic screening, spectrum
broadening and renormalization in the case of weakly pumped undoped graphene. We ﬁnd that incorrect treat-
ment of many-body eﬀects can lead to an order-of-magnitude error in the recombination rate. We show that
the AR time depends weakly (sublinearly) on the background dielectric constant, which limits the possibility
to control recombination by the choice of substrate. However, the AR time can be considerably prolonged by
placing graphene under a metal gate or by introducing a bandgap. With carrier cooling taken into account, our
results comply with experiments on photoexcited graphene.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Dirac materials, such as graphene [1], topological insula-
tors [2] (e.g., CdHgTe quantum wells [3]), and others [4],
possess an unusual low-energy electron dispersion similar to
that of relativistic electrons in vacuum, thus oﬀering an op-
portunity to observe relativistic quantum eﬀects on a tabletop.
Chiral anomaly [5], Klein tunneling [6], and the formation of
super-critical atoms [7] are among the brightest examples of
high-energy physics phenomena at the nanoscale. Conversely,
the eﬀects prohibited for relativistic electrons by conservation
laws are expected to be prohibited for electrons in Dirac ma-
terials. In particular, high-energy electrons in vacuum cannot
generate electron-hole pairs. In other words, impact ioniza-
tion of the Dirac sea is impossible [8], together with its inverse,
Auger recombination (AR).

A strong suppression of AR in Dirac materials suggests the
possibility of long-lived population inversion and eﬃcient far-
infrared lasing [9, 10]. The latter facts were indeed conﬁrmed
in CdHgTe-based quantum wells, where stimulated light emis-
sion was observed up to 19.5 µm wavelength [11], while the
measured recombination lifetime reached 65 ps at a band gap
of 14 meV and liquid-helium temperature [12]. Despite the
energy-momentum restriction for Auger processes being lifted
in the massless case, population inversion [13] and stimulated
emission [14] persisting over ∼150 fs at ∼2500 K have also
been observed in graphene.

Though the experimentally measured short nonradiative
lifetime in graphene raised almost no doubt, the calculation
of this time remains a challenging issue. The energy and
momentum conservation laws allow AR only between carri-
ers with collinear momenta [15] that occupy zero volume in
phase space. On the other hand, massless Dirac fermions with
parallel momenta have equal velocities and, therefore, inter-
act inﬁnitely long, which is known as the collinear scattering

∗ alymov@phystech.edu

singularity [16].
In addition, Coulomb interaction between
carriers moving in parallel undergoes inﬁnitely strong screen-
ing [17] due to the collinear divergence in the Lindhard po-
larization of massless Dirac fermions [18].
In view of the
above, the calculation of the AR rate in the massless Dirac
case would lead to an expression of the form 0 × ∞/∞2 if
higher-order many-body eﬀects are neglected.

These many-body eﬀects aﬀect AR in Dirac materials in
two radically opposite ways. Carrier-carrier scattering results
in a ﬁnite quasiparticle lifetime, thus softening the energy
conservation restriction [17]. The Coulomb renormalization
of the Dirac dispersion enhances the quasiparticle velocity in
the massless case [19] and increases the gap in the massive
case [20], thus further prohibiting AR [21]. Therefore, an ac-
curate description of AR in Dirac materials essentially requires
the inclusion of carrier interaction eﬀects.

An early theoretical study of Auger processes in gapless
graphene was carried out in Ref. [22], where static screening
was assumed and the indeterminate form 0 × ∞ was evaluated
without a detailed explanation. Later, Auger processes within
the same static screening approximation were included in the
semiconductor Bloch equations to study carrier kinetics in
graphene [23, 24] (see also Ref. [25] and references therein).
A regularization of the 0 × ∞ form involving weak en-
ergy nonconservation (attributed to the ﬁnite quasiparticle life-
time), which was performed in Ref. [17], justiﬁed the result
of Ref. [22]. At the same time, it was found that the carrier
kinetics within the static screening model disagrees with ex-
periments [26], and this discrepancy was ﬁxed by introducing
dynamic screening (evaluated for slightly noncollinear pro-
cesses to avoid inﬁnite screening and get a nonzero AR rate)
into the regularized expressions [17].

Introduction of dynamic screening after the regularization
was also done in Ref. [27], where the problem of inﬁnite
screening was avoided by broadening the polarizabilities. Ref-
erence [27] also provides a consistent method to calculate
this broadening, in contrast to Ref. [17], where a ﬁxed “non-
collinearity” parameter was used. However, even this approach
cannot be considered fully satisfactory, as the regularization

 
 
 
 
 
 
of expressions for the AR rate should involve dynamic screen-
ing from the very beginning.
Indeed, since the screening
shoots up for nearly collinear processes, the use of its collinear
value (i.e., the maximal one) instead of a proper average is
not justiﬁed. A more important issue is that considering
only collinear Auger processes, one excludes a whole class of
noncollinear plasmon-assisted processes brought about by dy-
namic screening. Though in principle one could include them
as a separate recombination channel [28], at realistic spectrum
broadening plasmon-assisted and collinear processes are not
well-separated and are better to be treated within a uniﬁed
approach.

Surprisingly, there have been no attempts to include the
renormalization of the quasiparticle spectrum in the AR rate
calculations.

In this paper, we develop a method for calculation of the
AR rate in Dirac materials, where AR is forbidden or almost
forbidden by conservation laws. The core of our approach is
the nonequilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF) formalism [29],
which is a standard tool to treat many-body eﬀects in quan-
tum kinetics [30] and has been successfully used to investigate
AR in parabolic-band semiconductors [31–33]. We ﬁnd that,
within the GW approximation [34], the AR rate can be ex-
pressed as a product of intra- and interband polarizabilities
timed by the square of the screened interaction and integrated
over the frequencies and wavevectors of virtual photons. The
information about carrier interactions is neatly absorbed into
dressed polarizabilities, which appears to be more convenient
than perturbative expansions of the recombination rate [35].

Though the developed method is general, in this paper we
focus on graphene, the most studied Dirac material. We cal-
culate the AR time in undoped graphene and study the role
of screening by dielectrics and metal gates, as well as of the
possible bandgap. Many-body phenomena, such as spectrum
broadening/renormalization and plasmon-assisted recombina-
tion, are all shown to have a signiﬁcant impact on the nonra-
diative lifetime. Contrary to the results obtained within the
static screening model [36], we ﬁnd that the strong intrinsic
screening of collinear processes does not leave much room to
control the AR rate solely by the choice of substrate. More-
over, we show that the presence of polar optical phonons in
high-κ dielectrics may even push the nonradiative lifetime in
the opposite way to what might be expected. We propose
another methods of controlling the AR rate in graphene and
show that it can be reduced almost by an order of magni-
tude under a metal gate and by several orders of magnitude in
gapped graphene. Our results agree with experimental studies
of carrier equilibration in photoexcited graphene [13, 37–39]
if carrier cooling is properly taken into account.

II. METHODS

In this section, we describe the calculation of the AR rate in
weakly pumped undoped graphene. We consider the stationary
case, when slightly diﬀerent chemical potentials for electrons
and holes are maintained by a continuous pump.

A. Model

We model graphene as a system of two-dimensional Dirac

fermions with the bare single-particle Hamiltonian [20]

ˆh = v0(σx ˆpx + σy ˆpy) + mσz,

(1)

where v0 is the bare Fermi velocity, ˆp is the electron momen-
tum, and σx,y,z are the Pauli matrices. The last term of the
Hamiltonian takes into account the possibility that a bandgap
2m may appear in graphene on certain substrates [40] or upon
chemical doping [41].

Hamiltonian (1) yields the following energies and eigen-

spinors:

(cid:15)sp = s

with s = +1 (−1) for the conduction (valence) band and ϕ
the angle between p and x-axis ((cid:126) and v0 are generally omitted
throughout this article). Each of these eigenstates comes in g =
4 independent “ﬂavors”, diﬀering in valley and spin projection.
For the following, we will also need the overlap factors:

with dielectric constant κ and placed under a metal gate at
distance dg.

We note that the interacting electrons can belong to diﬀerent
valleys, i.e., ν and ν(cid:48) are allowed to be diﬀerent in (5). This
process being perfectly legitimate was overlooked in some of
the previous works [17, 22], resulting in a missing factor of
two in the expressions for the AR rate.

When graphene is placed on or in a polar dielectric, an im-
portant additional recombination channel may be provided by
the polar phonons in the dielectric [28]. In principle, they could

be treated by adding two more terms into the Hamiltonian—
namely,
the bare phonon term and the Fröhlich electron-
phonon interaction [42]. However, in the Green’s function lan-
guage, phonons just add a new (phonon) propagator to the usual
Coulomb interaction, and the interaction becomes addition-
ally screened by lattice vibrations, V R(q, ω) = 2πe2/[κ(ω)q],
with frequency-dependent dielectric function κ(ω) given by
the Lorentz oscillator model (see Appendix B).

Other mechanisms of recombination typically proceed on
much longer timescales and are not considered in this paper,
though it is straightforward to include them if necessary. In
particular, recombination through intrinsic phonons has been
shown to take tens of picoseconds at room temperature [43],
while the radiative recombination time can be estimated as [44]

Now, the full complexity of the many-body problem is en-

mations in order to make the self-energy calculations feasible.
We have chosen the advanced yet tractable self-consistent GW
approximation, which captures all the many-body eﬀects we
are going to consider.

Calculations within this approximation proceed as fol-

from noninteracting Green’s functions and iterating Eqs. (8)
and (11) to (16) until convergence is achieved: G0 → Π0 →

All the integrals can be cast in the form of convolutions and
eﬃciently evaluated via the fast Fourier transform between
frequency/time [47] and the fast Hankel transform between
momentum/position [48].

2. Calculation of recombination rate

In the case of a weak pump, the recombination rate can
be found using equilibrium Green’s functions calculated self-
consistently as described in the previous section (the case of
a strong pump is more complicated and remains beyond the
scope of this article, see Conclusions). A weak pump does
not alter signiﬁcantly the quasiparticle spectrum, but changes
the distribution of carriers to that with separate Fermi levels
µc = −µv (cid:28) kT:

Fs(p, E) =

1
exp[(E − µs)/kT] + 1

(17)

4

(the use of the Fermi-Dirac distributions with band-dependent
Fermi levels is justiﬁed by the fast intraband equilibration com-
pared to recombination). That means that GR/A
(p, E) remain
unchanged, while G</>
(p, E) are updated according to (8), and
the carrier density increases by nnoneq ≡ n − neq. The popula-
tions of each band ne(t), nh(t) are kept constant by the balance
between the pump and recombination. Omitting pump terms
from the Kadanoﬀ-Baym (quantum kinetic) equations [30], we
obtain the total recombination rate [31, 32]:

This expression encompasses all the types of recombination
considered in the present model—namely, AR and recombi-
nation via substrate phonons. We stress that in our model,
recombination via emission of plasmons [28] should not be
added as a separate channel, since we do not consider their
coupling to free electromagnetic modes and assume all of
them eventually decay into single-particle excitations.

Within the GW approximation, the AR rate can also be

written as [31]

(∆µss(cid:48) ≡ µs − µs(cid:48)). The ﬁrst term describes the usual AR
(cc ↔ vc and cv ↔ vv processes, which have equal rates
in undoped graphene due to the electron-hole symmetry), the
second one describes strongly suppressed by conservation laws
“double recombination” (cc ↔ vv process).

Equation (19) with free-particle polarizabilities and dielec-
tric function might be obtained from Fermi’s golden rule.
However, in our method Eq. (19) includes dressed polarizabil-
ities, which conveniently absorb all interaction eﬀects within
the GW approximation.
Using Eq. (19),

it is easy to observe the pathology of
zero phase space and inﬁnite interaction time, as well as the
method for curing it. When many-body corrections are ne-
glected, Im ΠR
cc is nonzero in the region of intraband excita-
tions, −q ≤ ω ≤ q, while Im Π R
vc is nonzero in the region
of interband excitations, ω ≥ q. These regions overlap only
along the line ω = q, where both polarizabilties have square-
root singularities [18]. Therefore, one faces the integration of
an inﬁnite function over a region of zero measure. It has been
shown that this 0 × ∞ limit can be found if one allows for in-

undoped graphene vs the bare coupling constant α0 = e2/((cid:126)v0κ) at
diﬀerent values of the ultraviolet cutoﬀ Λ. From now on, all the results
are obtained from Eq. (19) with GW polarizabilities as described in
Methods, unless indicated otherwise.

AR rate is proportional to the Coulomb interaction squared.
However, this is realized only at very small α0. At intermediate
α0, screening by intrinsic carriers comes into play, reducing

ﬁnitesimal energy non-conservation, the result being [17, 22]

if the exchange terms are neglected (they are not captured by
the GW approximation).

The situation is further complicated when one remembers
that the Coulomb interaction is screened by the same divergent
polarizabilities, so Eq. (20) with dynamic screening yields
zero AR rate [17]. Naturally, these singularities are washed
out when quasiparticles acquire a ﬁnite lifetime.

cc ×Im Π R

Looking at Eq. (19) with dressed polarizabilities and
screened interaction, one could identify two regions in the
(q, ω) plane which provide the largest contributions to the AR
rate. The ﬁrst one is the region of collinear processes, ω ≈ q,
where Im Π R
vc is maximal. The second one lies around
the plasmon dispersion, where W R is large, and can be called
the region of plasmon-assisted recombination.
In practice,
when a realistic quasiparticle lifetime is used, these two re-
gions usually become broad enough to be indistinguishable.
They may become better separated in doped graphene, where
the plasmon spectrum is sharper and lies farther away from the
ω = q line.

In polar substrates, there are surface polar phonon modes
(SPPs) that are the origin of dispersion and intrinsic dielectric
loss (Im κ(ω) > 0) and provide an additional recombination
channel [28]:

In practice, the separation of the total recombination rate into
Auger and SPP contributions is not fully justiﬁed, because
the interaction between SPPs and carriers in graphene gives
rise to additional branches of collective excitations [28, 42],
(cid:12)(cid:15) R(q, 0)(cid:12)
which enhance AR via anti-screening ((cid:12)

A. Auger recombination in graphene: Role of dielectric
environment, gate, and bandgap

We ﬁrst present our results for the simplest case of graphene
in a dispersionless medium with dielectric constant κ at temper-
ature T. Using dimensional arguments, it is possible to show
that the AR time τAuger = nnoneq/RAuger, when expressed in di-
mensionless form (cid:126)τ−1
Auger/kT, can depend only on two dimen-
sionless parameters: the bare coupling constant α0 = e2/((cid:126)v0κ)
and the ultraviolet cutoﬀ expressed in units of temperature,
Λ/kT (Fig. 2). One might anticipate τ−1
0 because the

the role of substrate, and linear behavior is observed instead.
At large α0, the AR rate can even drop down, and a pronounced
dependence on the ultraviolet cutoﬀ Λ emerges. This feature is
related to the slowly decaying tails of the quasiparticle spectral
function, which introduce a cutoﬀ dependence into the intra-
band polarizability and, consequently, the screened interaction
(see the discussion at the end of this section).

In Fig. 3 we show the same dependence in dimensional
variables,1 assuming Λ = 2.5 eV [45]. At room temperature,
the AR time is around 1–2 ps, while at elevated temperatures
T = 1000–3000 K typical for carriers in photoexcited graphene
it can be as low as several tens of femtoseconds. Remarkably,
the AR rate does not change with varying the background
dielectric constant κ as much as one could expect. Increasing
κ from 5 to 25 leads only to a fourfold suppresion of AR at
room temperature. In practice, embedding graphene into high-
κ dielectrics can even shorten the recombination time due to
the emerging channels of recombination with emission of polar
substrate phonons. This shortening for graphene embedded in
hafnium dioxide is illustrated in Fig. 3 by the ﬁlled circle. In
contrast, optical phonons in intermediate-κ dielectrics (e.g.,
hexagonal boron nitride) usually lie at higher energies and
have smaller oscillator strengths, therefore having only a minor
impact on AR at room temperature. This is demonstrated with
an empty circle in Fig. 3; AR is slightly suppressed in this case

1 Due to large computational demands, T = 300 K and T = 500 K results
were obtained by extrapolation. The introduced error is comparable to
the errors arising from uncertainty of the cutoﬀ and the neglect of vertex
corrections.

due to the increase of the dielectric function near the phonon
energy.

Now we move on to the case of graphene under a metal
gate, which can serve as an alternative source of screening.
As shown in Fig. 4, in this way the AR rate can be reduced by
almost an order of magnitude. The form of the modiﬁed
Coulomb interaction V R(q) = (2πα0/q) (cid:2)1 − exp(−2qdg)(cid:3)
suggests it might be possible to absorb the inﬂuence of the gate
into an eﬀective coupling constant αeﬀ = α0[1 − exp(−2qT dg)]
with qT being some characteristic wavevector of order kT, and
dg being the distance from the gate. This is indeed possible
at low cutoﬀ, as shown by the dashed lines in the inset. How-
ever, it becomes impossible at larger cutoﬀ (solid lines in the
inset), because the mechanism of the cutoﬀ dependence of the
AR rate involves also processes with large momentum transfer
q (cid:29) qT , and the above arguments do not apply.

Another option to control the AR rate in graphene is to
introduce a bandgap, e.g., by substrate [40] or chemical dop-
ing [41]. As can be seen from Fig. 5, at small gaps Eg < kT the
eﬀect is minor, but at large gaps the AR time scales according
to the Arrhenius law, τ−1
Auger ∝ exp(−Eth/kT) (a typical behav-
ior in gapped semiconductors: carriers involved in AR cannot
have arbitrarily small energies [50]). The threshold energies
Eth are close to Eg as a result of a competition between two
factors. On one hand, conservation laws favor AR processes
involving high-energy carriers, which lie on the approximately
linear part of the spectrum. Near the band extrema, AR re-
quires carriers from tails of the spectral function and is there-
fore power-law suppressed (assuming the spectral function is
Lorentzian). On the other hand, at high energies the number
of carriers drops according to the Boltzmann distribution, and
AR is suppressed much more strongly (exponentially). In prin-

non-exponential dependence on temperature and bandgap [33],
but at the bandgap values presented in Fig. 5 the regime where
carriers from deep inside the gap contribute signiﬁcantly to the
AR rate is not reached yet. The exponential scaling of the AR
rate with the bandgap allows it to be reduced by several orders
of magnitude, though gapped graphene may be unsuitable for
some applications (e.g., low-THz generation).

B. Comparison with experiments

Carrier equilibration in photoexcited graphene has been in-
vestigated experimentally in a number of works, including
time- and angle-resolved photoemission [13, 37–39], pump-
probe [14], and time-resolved photoluminescence [51] mea-
surements. According to the series of papers by Gierz
et al. [13, 37–39], who were able to track the time evolution
of the carrier distrubutions in graphene after photoexcitation,
the carrier dynamics in photoexcited graphene proceeds in the
following stages: (i) thermalization within each band within a
few tens of femtoseconds; (ii) merging of the chemical poten-
tials for electrons/holes, typically within ∼130 fs; (iii) cooling,
which follows a biexponential decay with ∼100 fs and ∼1 ps
time constants. The ∼130 fs lifetime of the quasiequilibrium
state with population inversion is corroborated by pump-probe
experiments [14], in which negative optical conductivity per-
sisting over a similar timescale was found.
In Ref. [51] the
authors found that carriers are not yet fully thermalized 300 fs
after photoexcitation, but the carrier temperature (T ≈ 400 K)
in their experiments was signiﬁcantly lower than in those men-
tioned above.

At typical parameters realized in these experiments (high-
frequency κ ≈ 3.8 for graphene on SiC, T ≈ 2000 K), our
calculations yield τAuger ≈ 60 fs. Inclusion of recombination
via polar phonons in the SiC substrate does not signiﬁcantly
change this estimate. At ﬁrst, it seems to contradict the ex-
perimental value of ∼130 fs. This discrepancy is spurious,
as the experimental time describes the decay of population
inversion (i.e., the merging of quasi-Fermi levels), not of the
nonequilibrium carrier density. This diﬀerence is important at
strong nonequilibrium (when the nonequilibrium carrier den-
sity depends on the quasi-Fermi levels nonlinearly) and/or in
the presence of carrier cooling.

Indeed, the density of nonequilibrium electrons is a grow-
ing function of both the quasi-Fermi level and temperature. In
the absence of recombination, cooling pushes the quasi-Fermi
level up to keep the carrier density constant. In the presence of
recombination, the merging of electron and hole quasi-Fermi
levels is slowed down by cooling. Therefore, the recombina-
tion time τr (which characterizes the decay of nonequilibrium
carrier density) is shorter than the merging time of quasi-Fermi
levels τ∆µ (the lifetime of population inversion).

To put this on mathematical grounds, we present a simple
model that provides the means to extract the true recombina-
tion time from experimental data. We introduce four quan-
the carrier temperature T, the diﬀerence between the
tities:
electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels ∆µ, their merging time

τ∆µ = −∆µ (d∆µ/dt)−1, and the instantaneous cooling time
τT = −T (dT/dt)−1, all of which can be obtained in time-
resolved photoemission [37] or multi-color pump-probe exper-
iments [52]. Given these quantities at some particular moment
of time, it is easy to obtain the true recombination time τr at
this moment using the identity

with n = n(µ = ∆µ/2, T) and neq = n(µ = 0, T). This model
can be straightforwardly extended to the case of ﬁnite doping.
The calculated τr as a function of two dimensionless quantities
∆µ/kT and τT /τ∆µ is shown in Fig. 6 in units of τ∆µ (top row)
and τT (bottom row). As can be seen from the top row, τ∆µ may
considerably exceed τr , especially in weak nonequilibrium.

There exist some obstacles to an accurate comparison be-
tween our theory and time-resolved photoemission experi-
ments. The results presented in this paper do not directly
apply to the strongly nonequilibrium case (∆µ (cid:38) kT), while
small ∆µ remain below the experimental energy resolution.
However, available experimental data still aﬀords some esti-
mates. At t (cid:38) 100 − 200 fs experiments show no discernible
∆µ, meaning at least ∆µ (cid:46) kT. Assuming τ∆µ is positive
(Fermi levels converge, otherwise a nonequilibrium distribu-
tion would be observed again), we get τr /τT (cid:46) 0.2 from the
bottom row of Fig. 6. Taking τT = 700 fs [37], we conclude
that τr (cid:46) 140 fs on SiC at T ∼ 1500 K, in agreement with our
calculations, which give τr = 80 fs.

C. Role of many-body phenomena

Finally, we examine the inﬂuence of diﬀerent many-body
phenomena on the AR rate in graphene. The main motiva-
tion of this work was to incorporate actual spectrum broaden-
ing into the calculations instead of a rough estimate used in
Ref. [17], as the AR rate is expected to depend crucially on
the precise value of the spectrum broadening (when the latter
tends to zero, the AR rate vanishes). In Fig. 7, we present the
AR time in graphene with a constant broadening γ included
into the spectral function As(p, E) = (γ/π)/[(E − sv0p)2 + γ2].
In the γ → 0 limit, only collinear Auger processes are al-
lowed by conservation laws. When screening is considered
in the static approximation, ε(q, ω) ≈ ε(q, 0) (dashed lines),
these processes experience ﬁnite screening, and the AR rate
has a nonzero value at γ → 0 [17, 22]. In contrast, when the
full frequency dependence of the dielectric function is consid-
ered (solid lines), the inﬁnite screening of collinear processes
makes the AR rate vanish as γ ln(CkT/γ) with a constant C
of order unity (see Appendix A), independently of κ (intrinsic
screening dominates over extrinsic).

It might seem surprising at ﬁrst that at larger γ the inverse
AR time decreases again. However, this behavior is easy to
understand by considering the γ (cid:29) kT limit, when the density
of nonequilibrium carriers in a strongly broadened Dirac cone
grows as nnoneq ∝ γ∆µ, while the AR rate remains constant
(three frequency integrations with the Fermi-Dirac distribu-

sible cutoﬀ-dependent artifacts of GW approximation are minimal
(cutoﬀ Λ = 2.5 eV).

tions give RAuger ∝ T 2∆µ, see Appendix A). In this limit, the
characteristic momentum transfer in AR, (cid:126)q ∼ γ, is much
greater than the characteristic energy transfer (cid:126)ω ∼ kT, jus-
tifying the static screening approximation (solid and dashed
lines merge). Another unusual feature of the large-γ case is
the enhancement of AR when dynamic screening is used in-
stead of static one. This is attributed to plasmon-enhanced
AR in the (q, ω) regions around the plasmon dispersion where
|ε(q, ω)| < |ε(q, 0)|. We have performed GW calculations
with |ε(q, ω)|−1 clipped at its static value (dashed red curve
in Fig. 8) and found that plasmon-enhanced processes account
for around 40% of the total AR rate (solid red curve in Fig. 8).
Since plasmon-enhanced AR can be viewed as electron-hole
recombination with emission of plasmons followed by their re-
absorption by other carriers, it can be argued that letting plas-
mons decay into free electromagnetic modes instead of getting
reabsorbed might open a route towards eﬃcient graphene-
based THz lasers. This can be achieved by increasing the
coupling between plasmons and free electromagnetic modes
(e. g., by plasmonic gratings).

We also demonstrate the unreliability of simplistic ways
to include the spectrum broadening and screening into the

GW without plasmons, GW, sta�c, dynamic (relaxa�on-�me), dynamic (oﬀ-shell)T = 3000 KAR rate calculations. In previous works on AR in graphene,
spectrum broadening was usually not considered explicitly
(with exception of Ref. [53]). Instead, in Ref. [22] the limit
of zero spectrum broadening was considered within the static
screening approximation, and Eq. (20) comprising only strictly
collinear processes was obtained. Later, the same expression
was used with dynamic screening, and spectrum broadening γ
was taken into account either by taking the dielectric constant
for slightly noncollinear processes, assuming some particles
are oﬀ shell (ε(q, q ± 2γ) instead of ε(q, q)) [17], or by us-
ing an advanced version of the relaxation-time approximation
(ε(q, q + 2iγ) instead of ε(q, q)) [27], where γ is not constant
and is calculated from in- and out-scattering rates for each
electron state.

Green, blue, and black curves in Fig. 8 show the results
obtained using Eq. (20) within diﬀerent models of screen-
ing: static [22] (green), “oﬀ-shell dynamic” [17] (blue), and
“relaxation-time dynamic” [27] (black). We use a constant
γ obtained from our GW calculations as − Im ΣR on shell at
energy kT (the results do not change signiﬁcantly if a non-
constant γ is used in the “relaxation-time dynamic” approxi-
mation, as prescribed in Ref. [27]). Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that
the static screening approximation gives results rather close
to the full GW calculations. This indicates that the enhanced
screening of collinear processes and the weakened screening
of plasmon-assisted processes approximately average to the
static value of screening. The introduction of dynamic screen-
ing increases the AR rate despite the collinear divergence of
unbroadened polarizabilities: at realistic broadening, the “dy-
namical anti-screening” eﬀects reach the collinear region, at
least in the undoped case. The “oﬀ-shell dynamic” screening
approximation shows an overall poor performance, especially
at low κ (large γ), because at some wavevectors ε(q, q + 2γ)
is taken precisely at the plasmon dispersion, and the contri-
bution of such processes is therefore strongly overestimated.
It can be cured by considering only ε(q, q − 2γ), but at the
price of completely neglecting the plasmon contributions. On
the other hand, the “relaxation-time dynamic” approximation
shows a better performance, but still worse than the static one.
The successful application of the static screening approx-
imation to AR in graphene in previous works [22–25] can
also be explained by looking at Fig. 7: if actual values of γ
obtained in self-consistent calculations are used (shown with
circles), the results with dynamic screening turn out to be
rather close to the results with static screening in the γ → 0
limit. However, other many-body eﬀects render this early ap-
proach unreliable in some range of parameters (e.g., at room
temperature—compare Fig. 7 and Fig. 3).

These eﬀects are the renormalization of the quasiparticle
spectrum and of the screened interaction. The role of the
former is shown in Fig. 9. At small κ and T spectrum renor-
malization can reduce the AR rate by a factor of two. We
mention that it aﬀects the AR rate not only by strengthen-
ing the conservation law constraints, but also by reducing the
coupling constant.

In real materials, nonlinear dispersion does not require
electron-electron interactions and is present already in a tight-
binding model. The impact of this nonlinearity on the AR

the same as in Fig. 2; dashed lines:

the

time depends on the relative magnitude of this nonlinearity
compared to the spectrum broadening. If the nonlinearity is
smaller, it will not have much eﬀect on the conservation-law
restrictions and, therefore, on the AR time. In graphene, this
eﬀect is rather small up to moderately high temperatures: e.g.,
at T = 1000 K the true asymmetric electron-hole dispersion
deviates from the Dirac cone by ∼ 1.3 meV at E = kT [54],
which is less than the spectrum broadening γ ∼ 13 meV at
κ = 5. Trigonal warping is even weaker [21] (∼0.4 meV at the
above parameters), and its inﬂuence becomes further reduced
after averaging over angles. In contrast, in CdHgTe quantum
wells deviations from Dirac dispersion become signiﬁcant al-
ready at several tens of meV [55] and should play a crucial role
in AR at room temperature.

The renormalization of the screened interaction leads to the
cutoﬀ dependence of the AR rate and produces some unex-
pected features in the previous plots (e.g., nonmonotonicity in
Fig. 3 and intersecting curves in Fig. 4). It essentially origi-
nates from long tails of the spectral function, which translate
into long tails of the imaginary part of the intraband polariz-
ability. This aﬀects the real part of the latter via the Kramers-
Kronig relations and therefore enhances screening, suppress-
ing AR. Its inﬂuence is most pronounced at large Λ/(kT)—that
is, at low temperatures—and at strong coupling.

The reader is probably surprised by such a strong cutoﬀ de-
pendence of observable quantities. We would like to clarify
that this is most likely an artifact of the chosen approxima-

violating sum rules is a known drawback of the self-consistent
GW approximation [56]. We have tried to include spectrum
broadening only in Im Π R, but not in Re Π R, thereby elimi-
nating the strong cutoﬀ dependence from the latter (causality
was restored in the self-energy by using Kramers-Kronig rela-
tions for calculating Re ΣR), and the results indicate that one
should probably use low cutoﬀs (say, Λ = 5kT) within the GW

Λ = 100 kTΛ = 30 kTΛ = 10 kTno renormalization+ renormalizationkTscheme to obtain accurate results. Another argument in favor
of using a low cutoﬀ is that Im Π R tails become increasingly
longer at high cutoﬀs, leading to an increasingly stronger vi-
olation of sum rules, implying the GW solution moves away
from the exact one. However, holding Re Π R unbroadened is
a rather ad hoc trick, while an accurate resolution of the cutoﬀ
problem would require going beyond the GW approximation
and including vertex corrections, which is a computationally
challenging task. Therefore, we leave this problem for future
studies.

Finally, we comment on the validity of our results in view of
the cutoﬀ problem. Most of our qualitative results are cutoﬀ-
independent and have a simple physical explanation (those that
do not—e.g., the nonmonotonicity in Fig. 2—are not presented
as our main results), therefore they are probably correct. The
comparison with experiments is performed at high tempera-
ture, where the results are justiﬁed by the low Λ/kT ratio, as
discussed above. On the other hand, this is not the case for our
room-temperature AR times, which might therefore prove too
long.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a general formalism for the calculation
of Auger recombination rates in Dirac materials, where the
electron-hole dispersion is quasi-relativistic. In this case, the
lowest-order Auger processes are prohibited by the energy-
momentum conservation laws, calling for many-body eﬀects
to be considered. We have shown that within the GW approx-
imation, the AR rate can be expressed as the product of the
inter- and intraband polarizabilities timed by the square of the
screened Coulomb interaction [Eq. (19)], and these dressed
quantities conveniently absorb the eﬀects of carrier interac-
tion.

Using the developed formulation, we have shown that
AR in graphene is very sensitive to many-body eﬀects, and
their accurate treatment is essential to obtain the correct AR
rate. These many body eﬀects include:
(i) Broadening of
the quasiparticle spectrum due to their ﬁnite lifetime. As
the scattering time τsc becomes long, the AR time scales as
τAuger ∝ τsc/ln(const × T τsc) and tends to inﬁnity in the ab-
sence of scattering.
In practice, the limit of long scattering
time is not realized, and the energy-momentum restrictions
for AR are considerably washed out.
(ii) The interaction-
driven velocity enhancement near the Dirac point. It implies
the reduction in the eﬀective interaction constant and prolon-
gation of the recombination time. This eﬀect becomes most
important at low dielectric constants and temperatures. (iii)
Plasmon-assisted recombination. Accurate treatment of dy-
namic screening shows that it not only suppresses collinear
Auger processes, but also increases the contribution of non-
collinear processes by anti-screening near the plasmon disper-
sion, so that the AR rate may turn out even larger than in the
static screening model, contrary to the expectations based on
the collinear divergence of the bare polarizabilities [17].

The calculated recombination time τr in undoped graphene
is around 1–2 ps at room temperature on most common di-

10

electrics and below 100 fs at ∼1500–3000 K, which are the
typical carrier temperatures in photoexcited graphene. We
demonstrate that the experimentally observed lifetime of pop-
ulation inversion τ∆µ is longer than the recombination time
(the lifetime of excess carrier density) τr due to the eﬀect of
carrier cooling, which eﬀectively pushes the quasi-Fermi lev-
els apart. Taking this into account, we show that the available
experimental data [37] restricts the possible values of the re-
combination time in graphene on SiC to τr (cid:46) 140 fs at 1500
K, in agreement with our calculations, which yield τr = 80 fs.
Our results show that the AR time in graphene depends on
the background dielectric constant κ at most linearly within
the experimentally relevant range. This limits the possibilities
to control the recombination rate in graphene by the choice of
substrate, especially if one takes into account that high-κ di-
electrics provide an additional recombination channel through
substrate polar phonons [28]. However, AR can be readily
suppressed by placing the graphene layer near a metal gate,
which increases the room-temparature AR time from 1 ps at
κ = 5 without gate to 7 ps with gate at 1 nm from graphene.
An even more substantial AR suppression can be achieved in
gapped graphene with Eg > kT. The AR time scales accord-
ing to the Arrhenius law, as τ−1
Auger ∝ exp(−Eth/kT) with Eth
close to Eg or slightly more, yielding τAuger ≈ 30 ns at κ = 5,
T = 300 K, and Eg = 0.2 eV (similar parameters are realized
in graphene epitaxially grown on SiC [40]).

As the screening of Coulomb scattering by metal gates was
found to have a strong eﬀect on AR, one might expect the
screening by adjacent graphene layers in multilayer stacks also
to have a strong eﬀect on the carrier dynamics. However, extra
graphene layers not only contribute to screening, but also pro-
vide an extra pathway for recombination. Indeed, the energy
and momentum released upon electron-hole annihilation in
one layer can be transferred to an electron in an adjacent layer.
A similar process has been studied in the context of interlayer
heat transfer [57], and can be easily included in our formalism.
Due to the competition between screening and extra recombi-
nation channels, it is a priori not clear whether adjacent layers
would prolong or shorten the recombination time.

An important future extension of our method would be to
go beyond the GW approximation and study the role of vertex
corrections, both in the polarizability and the self-energy. The
neglect of vertex corrections to the self-energy in Eq. (18)
amounts to the neglect of exchange terms in the AR rate,
which is justiﬁed when the number of fermion ﬂavors g is large,
as is the case in certain Dirac materials. Even in graphene,
with g = 4, the neglect of exchange actually produces much
smaller errors than 1/g = 25 % [17], while in the recently
discovered three-dimensional Weyl semimetal TaAs g is as
large as 16 [58]. However, in three-dimensional topological
insulators typically g = 1 [2], and the exchange terms are
expected to play a signiﬁcant role. On the other hand, vertex
corrections to the polarizabilities are generally of the same
order as the corrections resulting from “dressing” the Green’s
functions and partially cancel them [59], which might cure the
unexpected strong-coupling behavior of the AR rate arising
from the cutoﬀ dependence of the intraband polarizability.

Another important extension is the study of recombination

at strong pumping, which is often realized in photoexcited
graphene and injection lasers. This extension is not straight-
forward. The reason is that a quasi-equilibrium carrier distri-
bution with a high enough population inversion µc − µv may
act as a gain medium for certain plasmon modes, which is
unphysical in steady-state case and renders Eq. (19) divergent
((cid:15) R(q, ω) turns to zero at some points). This divergence of
Coulomb scattering was noted already in the kinetic theory of
unstable plasma [60] and led to an overestimate of scattering
rates in the early simulations of pump-probe experiments [61].
Thus, the case of a continuous strong pump requires a full
pump+resonator+active medium simulation [62], so that the
plasmonic gain is either removed by spectral hole burning in
the carrier distribution or balanced by loss due to plasmons
leaving the active region, and the divergence disappears. This
divergence also disappears in the case of a pulsed pump, but
time-dependent simulations of carrier kinetics with taking into
account quantum many-body eﬀects (which are essential to de-
scribe AR) require the use of two-time Green’s functions [30]
and are computationally demanding.

Appendix A: Dependence of the AR rate in graphene on the
spectrum broadening

At γ (cid:28) kT,

the main contribution to the AR rate is
from the ω ≈ q region, where the polarizabilities exhibit
cc/vv ∝ 1/(cid:112)ω2 − q2 and
square-root singularities [18], Π R
vc ∝ 1/(cid:112)q2 − ω2 (Π R
Π R
cv is smooth there), while the screened
Coulomb interaction W R ≈ −1/Π R approaches zero. Af-
ter factoring out the square roots, the remaining integrand
in Eq. (19) stays ﬁnite (divergences of the Bose functions
are cancelled by zeros of the polarizabilities) and gives a γ-
independent factor. cc → vv process is strongly suppressed by
conservation laws and can be neglected. ω → ω + iγ substitu-
tion in the retarded Green’s function approximately translates
into ω → ω + 2iγ substitution in the polarizabilities, and
Eq. (19) becomes

(A1)
The ω and q integrals are cut oﬀ at ∼ ±kT by the Bose
functions and the Coulomb interaction (the latter decays like
1/q at q (cid:29) ω, kT), and (A1) yields RAuger ∝ γ ln(CkT/γ) with
C of order unity (numerical calculations depicted in Fig. 7
yield C ≈ 0.14).

To provide an estimate of RAuger in the γ (cid:29) kT case, it
is more convenient to rewrite Eq. (19) in terms of spectral
functions [32] in a form resembling the Fermi Golden Rule:

RAuger = 2πg2 (cid:88)

× (2π)2δ (p1 + p2 − p3 − p4)
× δ (E1 + E2 − E3 − E4) .

(A2)

Now we examine it term by term. The delta functions
remove one momentum and one energy integration. The
distribution functions constrain the remaining frequency in-
tegrals to |Ei | (cid:46) kT. The momentum integrals are con-
strained to pi (cid:46) γ by the spectral functions. The screened
Coulomb interaction can be taken in the static approximation
since pi ∼ γ (cid:29) Ei ∼ kT, and is of order 1/γ. Finally,
the overlap factors lie between 0 and 1 and are of order 1
In view of the above, at γ (cid:29) kT the pure re-
on average.
combination term is proportional to γ6T 3γ−2γ−4 = T 3. After

subtracting generation, we get RAuger ∝ T 2(µc − µv). On the
other hand, the density of nonequilibrium carriers acquires a γ
dependence: nnoneq ∝ ∬ d2p (cid:82) dE A(p, E)[ fc(E) − f eq
c (E)] ∝
γ2T γ−1(µc − µv)/T = γ(µc − µv), so the inverse recombination
time scales as T 2/γ.

In the above arguments all the integrals were assumed to
be convergent. Actually, this is not the case, because the den-
sity of states of a 2D Dirac cone with constant broadening
diverges logarithmically: DOS(E = 0) = g ∬ d2p
(2π)2 A(p, E =
0) ≈ g
γ , adding a cutoﬀ dependence to the above es-
timates. However, it does not change the main trends, and
the estimates derived in this section comply with numerical
calculations.

The phonon-induced frequency dependence of a dielectric
function is usually described by the Lorentz oscillator model:

where ωi and γi are the frequencies and the damping constants
of N transverse optical modes, and κi are the intermediate
dielectric constants related to the oscillator strengths and the

frequencies of longitudinal modes (κ0 is the static dielectric
constant; κN ≡ κ∞ is the high-frequency dielectric constant).
The parameters we used are presented in Table I.
