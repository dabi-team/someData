X3.4-class solar ﬂare event of AR 10930

Abstract. The variations of the 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁelds associated with the X3.4-
class ﬂare of active region 10930 are studied in this paper. The coronal magnetic ﬁeld
data are reconstructed from the photospheric vector magnetograms obtained by the Hin-
ode satellite and using the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld extrapolation method developed in
our previous work (He et al., 2011). The 3-D force-free factor α, 3-D current density, and
3-D magnetic energy density are employed to analyze the coronal data. The distribu-
tions of α and current density reveal a prominent magnetic connectivity with strong neg-
ative α values and strong current density before the ﬂare. This magnetic connectivity
extends along the main polarity inversion line and is found to be totally broken after
the ﬂare. The distribution variation of magnetic energy density reveals the redistribu-
tion of magnetic energy before and after the ﬂare. In the lower space of the modeling
volume the increase of magnetic energy dominates, and in the higher space the decrease
of energy dominates. The comparison with the ﬂare onset imaging observation exhibits
that the breaking site of the magnetic connectivity and site with the highest values of
energy density increase coincide with the location of ﬂare initial eruption. We conclude
that a cramped positive α region appearing in the photosphere causes the breaking of
the magnetic connectivity. A scenario for ﬂare initial eruption is proposed in which the
Lorentz force acting on the isolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity break-
ing site lifts the associated plasmas and causes the initial ejection.

1. Introduction

The ﬂare phenomenon in solar atmosphere is one of the
most important research subjects of solar physics [Benz ,
2008; Shibata and Magara, 2011; Hudson, 2011; Fletcher
It has close ties with coronal mass ejec-
et al., 2011].
tion (CME) [Zhang and Low , 2005; Chen, 2011; Webb and
Howard , 2012] as well as solar energetic particles [Schwenn,
2006; Aschwanden, 2012]. These solar explosive phenomena
are the main drivers of space weather [Schwenn, 2006].

The characteristics of solar ﬂare activity have tight corre-
lation with the 3-D magnetic ﬁeld structure and its evolution
in the solar atmosphere [Shibata and Magara, 2011]. It is
believed that the major solar ﬂare events are the results of
the magnetic ﬁeld reconnections happening in the solar at-
mosphere in solar active regions (ARs) [Priest and Forbes,
2002]. The 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld distributions before
and after ﬂare eruption contain critical physical information
to understand this change of magnetic connectivity.

Currently, although the coronal magnetic ﬁeld can be di-
agnosed to some extent [e.g., Lin et al., 2004; Cargill , 2009;
Chen et al., 2011], it is still diﬃcult to measure the 3-D coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld distributions directly. We have to rely
on physical models to reconstruct the 3-D coronal magnetic
ﬁeld data [Sakurai, 1981, 1989].

The corona is composed of magnetized plasma with ex-
tremely low density and very high temperature compared

cially above active regions, the magnetic ﬁeld dominates the
plasma, other forces (such as gravitational force and plasma
pressure) can be neglected. To achieve an equilibrium state,
the electric current density vector

j = (1/4π)(∇ × B)

(1)

(in electromagnetic CGS units) must be everywhere paral-
lel to the magnetic ﬁeld vector B, then the Lorentz force
vanishes. This physical situation can be described by the
so-called nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model which
consists of two main equations:

∇ × B = α(r)B,

B · ∇α = 0.

(2)

(3)

The parameter α in equations (2) and (3) is called force-free
factor. It has the dimension of L−1 (reciprocal of length)
and is a function of spatial location. As implied by equation
(3), α is a constant along each magnetic ﬁeld line.

The NLFFF model is a reasonable approximation to the
quasi-equilibrium corona [Wiegelmann and Sakurai, 2012]
and is commonly used for 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld recon-
struction above active regions [e.g., Schrijver et al., 2008; He
and Wang, 2008; Jing et al., 2008; DeRosa et al., 2009; He
et al., 2011; Fuhrmann et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Geor-
goulis et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2012; Inoue et al., 2012]. The
2-D photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data (vector mag-
netograms), which can be measured sophisticatedly, act as
the bottom boundary conditions in the NLFFF model and
pose strong constraints to the upper coronal magnetic ﬁeld
distributions. Based on the observed photospheric vector
magnetogram data and by solving equations (2) and (3) nu-
merically (a process called NLFFF extrapolation [Schrijver
et al., 2006; R´egnier , 2007; Wiegelmann, 2008]), the recon-
structed 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld can be obtained, which
is ready for the further analyses. By utilizing time series of

photospheric vector magnetograms, the NLFFF model can
also be used for tracing the evolution of the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld through a sequence of equilibria [Sakurai, 1989].

In our previous paper [He et al., 2011], we improved
our NLFFF extrapolation method and code [He and Wang,
2008] for the photospheric vector magnetograms obtained by
the Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) focal plane instrument [Lites
et al., 2013] of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) [Tsuneta
et al., 2008] aboard the Hinode satellite [Kosugi et al., 2007]
(Hinode/SOT-SP) and studied the time series evolution of
the reconstructed 3-D coronal magnetic conﬁgurations of
AR 10930 (NOAA ARs numbering system) when the ac-
tive region was near the central meridian of the Sun’s disk
and at a relatively low level of activity. In this paper, we
continue the work of He et al. [2011] and, by using the Hin-
ode data and NLFFF model, study the variations of the 3-D
coronal magnetic ﬁeld associated with a major (X3.4-class)
ﬂare event of AR 10930.

The X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930 happened on 13 December
2006, which was captured and thoroughly observed by the
instruments of Hinode [Watanabe et al., 2012] as well as
other space-based and ground-based solar telescopes [Mi-
noshima et al., 2009]. The evolution of AR 10930 and its re-
lation to the X3.4 ﬂare eruption have been analyzed by many
authors from diﬀerent viewpoints and approaches. For ex-
ample, Zhang et al. [2007] examined the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld and sunspot evolution of AR 10930 and related the
X3.4 ﬂare to the fast rotation of a positive polarity sunspot
and the interaction between the ephemeral regions; Min and
Chae [2009] further studied the rotating sunspot by using
the higher resolution data of Hinode and related the sunspot
rotation to the dynamic development of emerging twisted
magnetic ﬁelds; Park et al. [2010] investigated the time evo-
lution of the coronal relative magnetic helicity in AR 10930
and related the occurrence of the X3.4 ﬂare to the positive
helicity injection into an existing system of negative helic-
ity; Inoue et al. [2012] analyzed the temporal evolution of
the 3-D magnetic structure of AR 10930 through magnetic
twist and related the X3.4 ﬂare onset to a mix of diﬀer-
ently twisted ﬁeld lines and the strong currents contained in
the central region near the polarity inversion line (PIL, the
separation line between the positive and negative magnetic
polarities of active region).

In this paper, we employ three quantitative physical mea-
sures, 3-D force-free factor α, 3-D electric current density,
and 3-D magnetic energy density, to analyze the internal
variations of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld associated with the
X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930. Among the three coronal measures,
the 3-D force-free factor α is introduced to reﬂect the mag-
netic connectivity in the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. The electric
current density distribution in AR 10930 has been discussed
in the paper by Schrijver et al. [2008]. In this work, we ex-
tend the analysis to nine data sets of AR 10930 before and
after the X3.4 ﬂare to see time series variation of the cur-
rent density distribution in the active region, which can be
helpful to understanding the changes of internal ﬁne struc-
tures of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic energy
stored in AR 10930 has been evaluated in several papers
[e.g., Schrijver et al., 2008; Jing et al., 2010]. In this work,
we emphasize the spatial distribution of the magnetic energy
density and its time variation before and after the ﬂare.

The contents of this paper are organized as follows: In
section 2, we describe the data selection, projection eﬀect
correction, and alignment of the Hinode/SOT-SP photo-
spheric vector magnetograms as well as the NLFFF extrap-
olation for reconstructing the 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld as-
sociated with the X3.4 ﬂare event of AR 10930. In section 3,
we analyze the variations of the reconstructed 3-D coronal
magnetic ﬁelds before and after the ﬂare through the three
quantitative physical measures, force-free factor α, current
density, and magnetic energy density. In section 4, we com-
pare the distribution variations of the coronal physical mea-
sures before and after the ﬂare with the imaging observation

by Hinode/SOT during the ﬂare onset phase to investigate
the relation between the internal variations of the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬂare initial eruption. In section 5, we
make further discussions on the results of sections 3 and 4.
In section 6, we give summary and conclusion.

2.1. Photospheric Vector Magnetograms

According to the Solar Event Reports issued by the Space
Weather Prediction Center of NOAA (NOAA/SWPC) and
the solar soft X-ray ﬂux data obtained by Geostationary Op-
erational Environmental Satellites 11 and 12 (GOES 11 and
GOES 12) in the 1.0–8.0 ˚A wavelength band, the beginning
time and the maximum time of the X3.4-class X-ray ﬂare of
AR 10930 are 13 December 2006 02:14 UT and 02:40 UT,
respectively. Before this ﬂare, the active region was at a rel-
atively low level of activity for several days (8–12 December
2006) with no major ﬂare events. We study the variations of
the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of AR 10930 from 11 December
2006, when the active region was just in the central area of
the Sun’s disk, until the end of the X3.4 ﬂare event on 13
December 2006.

Nine photospheric vector magnetograms of AR 10930 ob-
tained by the Hinode/SOT-SP instrument within the 3 days
between 11 and 13 December 2006 are selected for the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld reconstruction, six magnetograms for
the preﬂare phase and three magnetgrams for the postﬂare
phase. All nine magnetograms were observed in the Fast
Map operation mode of Hinode/SOT-SP [Tsuneta et al.,
2008; Lites et al., 2013], which takes 63 min to complete
a scan of 295(cid:48)(cid:48) × 162(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld of view (FOV). The Fast Map
mode of Hinode/SOT-SP is preferred in this work because
it possesses the best balance between larger FOV and higher
cadence for the extrapolation and time series evolution stud-
ies of AR 10930 [He et al., 2011].

Table 1 gives the basic information (observation time,
FOV, coordinates, preﬂare/postﬂare) of the nine selected
Hinode/SOT-SP photospheric vector magnetograms. For
ease of identiﬁcation, the nine magnetograms are labeled
from M1 to M9, respectively, as shown in Table 1. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the observation times of the nine selected
Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms on the graph of the solar
soft X-ray ﬂux curves recorded by GOES 11 and GOES 12
satellites in the 1.0–8.0 ˚A wavelength band. The graph of
the solar X-ray ﬂux covers the time period from 10 Decem-
ber 2006 00:00 UT to 15 December 2006 00:00 UT and in-
cludes the X3.4 ﬂare event on 13 December 2006. In Figure
1, the observation times of the nine selected magnetograms
are indicated by nine vertical bars which are marked from
M1 to M9, respectively, according to the labels of the mag-
netograms. The width of each vertical bar represents the
duration of observation period (about 63 min) for each mag-
netogram. As demonstrated in Figure 1, M1–M6 are preﬂare
magnetograms, M7–M9 are postﬂare magnetograms.

Figure 2 displays the locations and coverage areas of the
nine selected Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms of AR 10930
on the disk of the Sun. In Figure 2, the center points of the
nine magnetograms (representing the locations of the mag-
netograms) are indicated by nine diamond symbols lined up
from the central region of the Sun’s disk to the west (M1
at the easternmost point, M9 at the westernmost point),
the coverage areas of the magnetograms are represented by
white rectangles (only shown for M1 and M9 to keep the
diagram concise, the other magnetograms having the same

a The nine Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms of AR 10930 are labeled from M1 to M9, respectively, for ease of identiﬁcation.
b All nine magnetograms were observed in the Fast Map operation model of Hinode/SOT-SP [Tsuneta et al., 2008; Lites et al.,
2013] which takes 63 min to complete a scan of the whole 295(cid:48)(cid:48) × 162(cid:48)(cid:48) FOV. The times listed in this column are the start time of
observation. Dates are formatted as year/month/day.

c The original magnetograms need to be corrected for the projection eﬀects before doing coronal magnetic ﬁeld reconstruction.
The FOV of the corrected magnetograms is 290(cid:48)(cid:48) × 160(cid:48)(cid:48), with the distortion edges being cut out to acquire aligned and uniform maps.
d XCEN is the X coordinate of the magnetogram’s center point in the heliocentric coordinate system. The coordinate data
of the Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms listed here (XCEN, YCEN, LONCEN, and LATCEN) are adjusted by comparing with the
SOHO/MDI full-disk magnetograms [Scherrer et al., 1995] through cross-correlation technique [Fisher and Welsch, 2008], which are
sightly diﬀerent from the coordinate values contained in the Level 1 and Level 2 data of Hinode/SOT-SP [Centeno et al., 2009; Lites
and Ichimoto, 2013].

e YCEN is the Y coordinate of the magnetogram’s center point in the heliocentric coordinate system.
f LONCEN is the longitude value of the magnetogram’s center point in the heliographic coordinate system, positive to the west,

negative to the east.

g LATCEN is the latitude value of the magnetogram’s center point in the heliographic coordinate system, positive to the north,

negative to the south.

h The X3.4 ﬂare event happened on 13 December 2006 with the beginning time and the maximum time being 02:14 UT and 02:40

UT, respectively. Then M1–M6 are preﬂare magnetograms, M7–M9 are postﬂare magnetograms.

i Certain columns of pixels were missing in the original Hinode/SOT-SP data of M4, which are patched up via interpolation. The
missing pixels are located at the left (east) side of the magnetogram and in the weak ﬁeld region, which has little impact on the result
of coronal magnetic ﬁeld reconstruction.

FOV). The background full-disk line-of-sight (LOS) magne-
togram employed in Figure 2 was observed by the Michel-
son Doppler Imager (MDI) [Scherrer et al., 1995] aboard
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft
[Domingo et al., 1995] (SOHO/MDI) at 13 December 2006
01:36:27 UT (38 min before the start of the X3.4 ﬂare of AR
10930).

The Level 0 data [Matsuzaki et al., 2007] associated with
the nine selected magnetograms are the original Stokes spec-
tral data of Fe i lines at 6301.5 ˚A and 6302.5 ˚A [Tsuneta
et al., 2008; Lites et al., 2013] acquired by Hinode/SOT-
SP; the Level 1 data of Hinode/SOT-SP are the calibrated
Stokes proﬁle data [Lites and Ichimoto, 2013]; the Level 2
data are the vector magnetic ﬁeld data after the inversion of
Stokes proﬁles [Lites et al., 2007]. Our studies in this paper
are mainly based on the Level 2 data of Hinode/SOT-SP.
The Level 0 and Level 1 data associated with the nine se-
lected magnetograms are also employed to obtain the de-
tailed coordinates information of the magnetograms and to
help determine the locations of the missing pixels (see foot-
note i of Table 1) in the Level 2 data.

The 180◦ ambiguities [Metcalf et al., 2006; Leka et al.,
2009] in the transverse components of the nine Hinode/SOT-
SP photospheric vector magnetograms were resolved by us-
ing the NPFC (nonpotential ﬁeld calculation) disambigua-
tion code developed by Georgoulis [2005].

2.2. Projection Eﬀect Correction and Alignment of
the Photospheric Vector Magnetograms

Considering that the X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930 occurred at
the west side of the Sun’s disk (about W22.5◦ in the he-
liographic coordinate system, see Figure 2), the projection
eﬀects in the Hinode/SOT-SP vector magnetograms need to
be corrected both for the shapes of the magnetograms and
for the directions of the magnetic ﬁeld vectors before do-
ing coronal magnetic ﬁeld reconstruction (NLFFF extrapo-
lation).

When observing an active region, the pointing of the Hin-
ode satellite is set up to track the active region continuously
with the speed of the solar diﬀerential rotation [Tsuneta
et al., 2008]. We conduct the projection eﬀect corrections
for the Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms accordingly. That
is, the corrected vector magnetograms are what we see from
just above the tracking point of the active region. By match-
ing the coordinates of the tracking point in the process of
projection eﬀect correction, the alignment of the corrected
magnetograms can also be achieved.

In the practical operation of the projection eﬀect cor-
rection,
to fully utilize the original resolution of the
Hinode/SOT-SP Fast Map data (0.295(cid:48)(cid:48) × 0.317(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel
[Kubo et al., 2007]), we ﬁrst adopt 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel resampling
resolution to produce the projection-eﬀect-corrected vector
magnetograms. The FOV of the corrected magnetograms is
290(cid:48)(cid:48) × 160(cid:48)(cid:48) (1160 × 640 pixels) with the distortion edges
being cut out to acquire an aligned and uniform time series.
Then the 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel data of the corrected magnetograms
are rebinned to 1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel data (290×160 grid and 290(cid:48)(cid:48)×160(cid:48)(cid:48)
FOV) which act as the actual input data for the NLFFF ex-
trapolations (see section 2.3).

2.3. NLFFF Extrapolation

The NLFFF extrapolation method employed to recon-
struct the 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld from the nine selected
Hinode/SOT-SP photospheric vector magnetograms is the
same as the method described and applied in our previ-
ous paper [He et al., 2011], which is a NLFFF extrapola-
tion scheme based on the direct boundary integral equation
(DBIE) formulation [Yan and Li, 2006] (see also the papers
by He and Wang [2006, 2008] for more details about the
development path of our method).

In this work, we adopt 1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel resolution (uniform in X,
Y , and Z direction, 1(cid:48)(cid:48) ∼ 714km) to perform the NLFFF ex-
trapolation calculations (a relatively higher resolution than

2-D photospheric vector magnetograms are 290 × 160 grid

on the nine sets of 3-D coronal magnetic conﬁgurations
extrapolated from the nine projection-eﬀect-corrected and
aligned Hinode/SOT-SP photospheric vector magnetograms

Field
3.1. Variation of the Photospheric Magnetic Field

The photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of AR 10930 evolved
continuously in the three-day time period (11–13 December
2006) when the nine selected Hinode/SOT-SP vector mag-
netograms were observed before and after the X3.4 ﬂare.

eﬀect-corrected and aligned Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms
in full resampling resolution (0.25(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel, see section 2.2)
and full FOV (290(cid:48)(cid:48) × 160(cid:48)(cid:48)), and Figure 4 shows the evolu-
tion of the vector magnetic ﬁeld in the central area (strong
ﬁeld region) of the active region. (Hereafter, we use the same
X and Y coordinates in the ﬁgures, in which the coordinate
values are counted from the lower left corner of the full FOV
of the magnetograms.)

As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the location of the main
negative polarity of AR 10930 in the north was almost un-
changed during the 3 day evolution, while the main positive
polarity in the south rotated counterclockwise and moved

eastward all the time, which reﬂects the behavior of the
dense plasma ﬂow beneath the photosphere [Fan, 2009].
The transverse component Bt of the vector magnetograms
also changed continuously with the development of magnetic
shear [Zhang et al., 2007] along with the motion of the main
positive polarity (see Figure 4).

The rotation of the main positive polarity in AR 10930
has been quantitatively studied by Zhang et al. [2007] and
Min and Chae [2009] through the rotation angle of the cor-
responding sunspot.
In the work of Zhang et al. [2007],
they examined the counterclockwise rotation of the positive
polarity sunspot in AR 10930 based on the white light ob-
servations by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer
(TRACE) satellite [Handy et al., 1999] and found a total ro-
tation angle of 240◦ from the end of 10 December 2006 to 13
December 2006. Min and Chae [2009] employed a new tech-
nique and the higher-resolution data (G band images taken
by Hinode/SOT [Tsuneta et al., 2008]) to study the behav-
ior of the rotating positive polarity sunspot and reported
a total counterclockwise rotation angle of 540◦ during 9–13
December 2006.

In this work, we focus on the variations of the magnetic
ﬁeld before and after the X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930. The Bz
component images of M6 and M7 (observed just before and
after the ﬂare eruption, see Figure 1) in the central area
of the active region are compared in Figure 5 to show the
changes of the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds before and after

ity (black contours) in the magnetograms more clearly. The
counterclockwise rotation of the main positive polarity in
AR 10930 is represented by the curved thick black arrows
in Figures 5a and 5c.

Along with the photospheric motion in AR 10930, an ap-
parent variation in the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld between

M6 and M7 is the appearance of a narrow patch with neg-
ative ﬂux and kG magnitude of Bz in the positive polarity
region of M7, which is located right below the main PIL (po-
larity inversion line between the main positive and negative
polarities) of M7 and is indicated by the thick white arrows
in Figures 5b and 5d. We will further discuss this negative
ﬂux patch in the following sections.

The variation of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld can also
be shown by the estimation of the total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux through the photosphere, which will be given in section
3.4.1 along with the evaluation of the total magnetic energy.

3.2. Variation of the Field Line Conﬁguration

The ﬁeld line conﬁgurations of the nine sets of recon-
structed 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld overlying the corre-
sponding Bz component images of photospheric magne-
tograms are shown in Figure 6 in full FOV (290(cid:48)(cid:48) × 160(cid:48)(cid:48)).
The ﬁeld lines displayed in Figure 6 are traced and plotted
in the volume between layer 0 (bottom layer with photo-
spheric magnetogram data) and layer 29 of the 3-D coronal
data grid (1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel, see section 2.3), the starting points of
ﬁeld line tracing are evenly spaced on layer 0. Open ﬁeld
lines (ﬁeld lines that leave the given volume) in Figure 6 are
plotted in black color, and closed ﬁeld lines (ﬁeld lines with
both foot points being anchored at the layer 0) are plotted
in white color.

The nine ﬁeld line images in Figure 6 are arranged from
left to right and from top to bottom in the order of their
associated magnetograms to give a full view of the time se-
ries variation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations as
the responses to the magnetic ﬁeld changes in the photo-
sphere [He et al., 2011].
In Figures 6f and 6g, it can be
seen that the ﬁeld line conﬁgurations associated with M6
and M7, which were observed just before and after the X3.4
ﬂare of AR 10930, show distinct diﬀerence in the central
area of the active region. In the following subsections, we
use quantitative physical measures to analyze the variations

of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld in the core of the active region
before and after the ﬂare.

3.3. Variations of the Force-Free Factor α and
Electric Current Density Distribution

The quantitative physical measure force-free factor α is
deﬁned in equation (2), which is a scalar function of spatial
location and represents the nonpotential nature of active re-
gions when diﬀerent from zero. An important characteristic
of the force-free factor α is that the value of α is a con-
stant along each ﬁeld line (in the context of NLFFF model)
as implied by equation (3). Then the 3-D distribution of
α can reﬂect the magnetic connectivity in the 3-D coronal
magnetic ﬁeld.

The quantitative physical measure electric current den-
sity j is expressed in equation (1), which is an important
quantity for describing the magnetic activity in active re-
gions [Leka and Barnes, 2007].
In the context of NLFFF
model, the orientation of the current density vector j is par-
allel to the magnetic ﬁeld vector B, then the distribution of
current density can also be helpful to understanding the in-
ternal ﬁne structures of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld [Schrijver
et al., 2008].

In this subsection, we use the distribution of force-free
factor α together with the distribution of electric current

volume between layer 0 and layer 29 (290×160×30 pixel volume) of the 3-D coronal data grid (1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel),
and the starting points of ﬁeld line tracing are evenly spaced on the bottom layer (layer 0). Open ﬁeld

density to analyze the variation of the magnetic connectiv-
ity in the coronal magnetic ﬁelds of AR 10930 before and
after the X3.4 ﬂare.
3.3.1. Force-Free Factor α Distribution

The 3-D spatial distribution data of the force-free factor
α were calculated from the nine sets of reconstructed 3-D
coronal magnetic ﬁeld data (1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel, see section 2.3) by
using the following equation [He et al., 2011]:

α =

(∇ × B) · B
B2

,

(4)

which can be deduced from equation (2).

By examining the calculated 3-D data of α, it is found
that the typical absolute values of α in the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld of AR 10930 are about 0.1 Mm−1, which is consistent
with the distribution range of α values in the literatures
[e.g., Pevtsov et al., 1995; Leka, 1999]. The α values with
this order of magnitude mainly spread in the regions around
the PILs and not far from the photosphere (corresponding
to the low-lying sheared magnetic ﬁeld lines over the PILs).
In the central area of the active region, the distribution of
α values presents sharp decline with increase in height (see
Appendix A for illustrations of α vertical distributions in
AR 10930).

We use the data of α on layer 2 of the nine reconstructed
3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld data sets to demonstrate the time
variation of the α distributions before and after the X3.4
ﬂare of AR 10930. The resulting images (horizontal distri-
bution of α on layer 2) over the full FOV (290(cid:48)(cid:48) × 160(cid:48)(cid:48)) are

displayed in Figure 7. (More α distribution images on layers
of diﬀerent heights can be found in Appendix A.)

From Figure 7 it can be seen that, in the central area
of AR 10930, the local distributions of α are dominated by
negative values (represented by red color in Figure 7). The
negative values of α mean that the current density vector
and the coronal magnetic ﬁeld vector have opposite direc-

area of the active region with weak magnetic ﬁeld (|B| ap-
proaching zero), the values of α are noisy as shown in Figure
7 and may not be reliable.
3.3.2. Electric Current Density Distribution

The 3-D data of the electric current density were calcu-
lated from the nine sets of reconstructed 3-D coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld data (1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel, see section 2.3) by using equa-
tion (1). We introduce a vertically averaged intensity map,
I(x, y), as in the paper by He et al. [2011] to display the cur-
rent density magnitude distribution in the coronal magnetic
ﬁeld, which is deﬁned as

I(x, y) =

where Lz is the height of the volume over which to perform
the vertical integration.

The maps of I(x, y) for the nine reconstructed coronal
magnetic ﬁeld data sets were computed according to equa-
tion (5) over the volume between z = 0 and z = 42 Mm (i.e.,
Lz = 42 Mm). The resulting images are shown in Figure 8
in full FOV. The current density magnitude in Figure 8 is

by using equation (4), and the images are displayed in full FOV. In the marginal area of the active region
with weak magnetic ﬁeld (|B| approaching zero), the values of α are full of noises and may not be reli-
able. The thick dashed line in Figure 7f and the thick dotted lines in Figure 7g outline the conﬁgurations

as expressed in equation (1). The time variation of the cur-
rent density distributions before and after the X3.4 ﬂare of
AR 10930 can be seen in Figure 8 as a reﬂection of the in-
ternal variation of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds.

The vertical distributions of current density magnitude
in AR 10930 are illustrated and compared with the vertical
distributions of force-free factor α in Appendix A. As seen
in Figures A1e and A1f, the electric current density values
also present rapid decrease with increase in height.
3.3.3. Change of Magnetic Connectivity Before and
After the Flare as Revealed by the α and Current
Density Distribution

In the α distribution images in Figure 7, it can be seen
that there are segments of strong α values (represented by
dark red color, |α| greater than 0.15 Mm−1) which extend
roughly along the PILs. Considering α constant along each
ﬁeld line, the segment distributions of large α value along
PILs should represent local magnetic connectivities in the
low corona (except the marginal area of the active region
where the α values are noisy and may not be reliable). By
comparing with the current density distribution images in
Figure 8, it can be seen that in the strong magnetic ﬁeld
areas (see Figure 3), the local magnetic connectivities with
strong α values also correspond to the local distributions of
strong current density (see section 3.3.4 for further analysis
of the relation between α and current density). Hereafter, we
refer to this kind of local magnetic connectivity as strong α

and strong current density magnetic connectivity, or strong
magnetic connectivity for short.

By examining the α and current density distributions be-
fore and after the ﬂare (see Figures 7 and 8), it can be found
that both the α distributions and the current density dis-
tributions associated with M6 and M7 (observed just before
and after the ﬂare eruption) show clear diﬀerences. There
exists a strong magnetic connectivity in the central area of
the active region before the ﬂare as shown in Figures 7f and
8f (α and current density distribution images correspond-
ing to M6), which extends along the main PIL (where the
X3.4 ﬂare happens) and is outlined by a thick dashed line in
Figure 7f. This strong magnetic connectivity is found to be
totally broken after the ﬂare eruption as shown in Figures
7g and 8g (α and current density distribution images corre-
sponding to M7). The conﬁguration of the broken magnetic
connectivity after the ﬂare is outlined by two thick dotted
lines in Figure 7g (corresponding to the two branches of the
broken magnetic connectivity). Hereafter, the local region
between the two branches of the broken magnetic connec-
tivity is named the magnetic connectivity breaking site or
breaking site for short.

The enlarged α (on layer 2) and current density distribu-
tion images as well as the Bz images associated with M6 and
M7 in the central area of the active region (around the main
PIL) are shown in Figure 9. (More α distribution images

can be found in Appendix A.) The three images in the left
column of Figure 9 (from top to bottom in the order of Bz,
current density, and α) are preﬂare images (corresponding
to M6), and the three images in the right column of Figure 9
are postﬂare images (corresponding to M7). An isogram of
the α distribution (white contour lines) associated with M6
(preﬂare map) is plotted overlying all the images in Figure 9
to demonstrate the change of magnetic connectivity before
and after the ﬂare more clearly. An isogram of the current
density distribution associated with M7 (postﬂare map) is
plotted in black color overlying the α isograms in Figures
9b and 9d to show the breaking site of the magnetic connec-
tivity explicitly. The breaking site is also indicated by the
thick white arrows in Figures 9b, 9d, and 9f. The directions
of the magnetic ﬁelds along the magnetic connectivities be-
fore and after the ﬂare are determined by comparing with
the ﬁeld line conﬁgurations as well as the vector magnetic
ﬁeld distribution on layer 2 of the 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld
data (see Appendix B for details), and are shown in Figures
9e and 9f via thin white arrows.

It can be seen in Figure 9b that the breaking site of the
strong magnetic connectivity is just on top of a local region
featured by the narrow negative ﬂux patch that appears in
M7 (see section 3.1 and Figures 5b and 5d for description
and clear images of the negative ﬂux patch).
3.3.4. Further Analysis of the Relation Between α
and Current Density

The distribution images of force-free factor α and current
density have similar appearance to some extent (see Figures
7 and 8, and vertical distribution images in Appendix A)

because the two physical measures are related by equation

j = (1/4π)αB

(6)

(in the context of NLFFF model), which can be obtained
from equations (1) and (2).

As shown in equation (6), the magnitude of the current
density is decided by both the values of α and the strength
of B. Then the distribution of current density can indicates
the key areas with both strong α values (representing non-
potential property) and strong magnetic ﬁeld values (con-
taining more magnetic energy) in active regions (see Figure
8 for example), which is very useful for solar active region
and ﬂare forecasting studies [Schrijver et al., 2008; Leka and
Barnes, 2007]. The force-free factor α itself does not reﬂect
the strength of B as implied by equations (2) and (4). Even
in the regions with low magnetic ﬁeld strength, the values
of α can be strong (except the noisy data) as demonstrated
in Figure 7.

From Figure 9 it can be seen that, around the break-
ing site of the magnetic connectivity, the value of α after
the ﬂare (in Figure 9f, associated with M7) shows a little
decrease compared with the value of α before the ﬂare (in
Figure 9e, associated with M6), which can be understood as
the relaxation of the local magnetic twist [Seehafer , 1990].
However, the magnitude of the current density after the ﬂare
(see Figure 9d) shows increase compared with the current
density magnitude before the ﬂare (see Figure 9c). By using

the main PIL before the ﬂare (see main text for the explanation of the strong magnetic connectivity).
A current density isogram (contour level, 6.10 × 10−8 G cm−1) associated with M7 (postﬂare map) is
plotted overlying the α isograms in Figures 9b and 9d in black color to show the breaking site of the
magnetic connectivity after the ﬂare. The breaking site is also indicated by the thick white arrows in
Figures 9b, 9d, and 9f. The thin white arrows in Figures 9e and 9f indicate the directions of the magnetic
ﬁelds along the magnetic connectivities before and after the ﬂare.

equation (6), the diﬀerent variation tendencies of the α and
current density values can be interpreted by an enhancement
of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the local region. Although
the value of α decreases, the overall eﬀect of α and B in
equation (6) is increased, which leads to the magnitude in-

crement of the current density after the ﬂare. (The strength
enhancement of the magnetic ﬁeld around the breaking site
of the magnetic connectivity is also supported by the in-
crease of the magnetic energy density in the local region,
see section 3.4.2 for details.)

for the potential ﬁeld extrapolations. The values of EPF were calculated by using equation (7) and based on the potential ﬁeld data.

3.4. Variation of the Magnetic Energy

in a volume Ω can be expressed by equation [Sakurai, 1989;
R´egnier and Priest, 2007]:

E =

Ω

B2
8π

dΩ.

(7)

By restricting the Ω to the scale of the volume unit, the
equation (7) can also be used for calculating the magnetic
energy density values.

In this subsection, we use the reconstructed coronal mag-
netic ﬁelds of NLFFF model to evaluate the magnetic en-
ergy stored in AR 10930 and analyze the time variation of
the magnetic energy density spatial distributions before and
after the X3.4 ﬂare.
3.4.1. Total Magnetic Energy

The total magnetic energy values associated with the nine
sets of reconstructed 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁelds (repre-
sented by ENLFFF) were calculated over the 290 × 160 × 160
pixel volume (1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel, see section 2.3) by using equation
(7), and the results are listed in Table 2. The time series
variation of the total energy values is illustrated in Figure
10 through square symbols, with the solar soft X-ray ﬂux
curve as the background for reference. As shown in Table 2
and Figure 10, the magnitude of the total magnetic energy
(ENLFFF) in AR 10930 has the order of 1033 erg and the
energy ﬂuctuation range has the order of 1032 erg, which is
consistent with the magnetic energy values of AR 10930 in
the literatures [e.g., Schrijver et al., 2008].

The magnetic energy of the potential ﬁeld (extrapolated
from the same magnetogram data as used by the NLFFF
extrapolation, but only utilizing the Bz component), EPF,
and the free magnetic energy, Efree (deﬁned as Efree =
ENLFFF − EPF) [R´egnier and Priest, 2007], were also cal-
culated for the nine coronal data sets. The free magnetic
energy gives an estimate of the available portion of energy
that powers the solar explosive events. The results of EPF
and Efree are listed in Table 2 with the values of ENLFFF,
and are plotted in Figure 10 by using diamond symbols (for
EPF) and triangle symbols (for Efree), respectively. The
values of the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux through the pho-
tosphere (represented by Φ), which is related with the values

of magnetic energy in the corona, are included in Table 2
and plotted in Figure 10 (through dotted line and asterisk
symbols) as well for reference.

tal magnetic energy contained in the reconstructed 3-D

10930 varies before and after the X3.4 ﬂare eruption. (a) Diﬀerence curve of the magnetic energy vertical
distributions between EM 6 and EM 7. The three vertical dotted lines (from left to right) denote the
layer 11 (maximum energy increment layer), layer 36 (separation layer between energy increasing and
decreasing), and layer 60 (representative layer of energy decreasing), respectively. (b) Bz image of M7
(observed just after the ﬂare eruption). The main PIL between the main negative and positive polarities
in the active region is indicated by a thick white line, which is also drawn in Figures 11c and 11d. (c
and d) Diﬀerence images of the energy density horizontal distributions between EM 6 and EM 7 at layer
11 and layer 60, respectively. The volume unit used for calculating the energy density is a cube with
one pixel length (Lpixel) in X, Y , and Z direction. In Figure 11c, the distribution of the energy den-
sity diﬀerence (EM 7 − EM 6) inside the saturation area is displayed by two contour lines (contour levels,
6.0 × 1027, 12.0 × 1027erg/L3

pixel), which are also plotted in Figure 11b.

It can be seen in Table 2 and Figure 10 that the ﬂuctua-
tion range of the potential ﬁeld energy (EPF) has the order of
1031 erg, and the ﬂuctuation range of the free magnetic en-
ergy (Efree) has the order of 1032 erg (the same order as the
ﬂuctuation range of ENLFFF). Then the proﬁle of the Efree
curve in Figure 10 is dominated by the ENLFFF variation.
Since free magnetic energy is a global concept and ENLFFF
dominates the proﬁle of the free magnetic energy variation
in AR 10930, our following analysis of the time variation
of the magnetic energy spatial distribution before and after
the ﬂare is based on the 3-D magnetic energy density data
associated with ENLFFF.
3.4.2. Variation of the Magnetic Energy Spatial Dis-
tribution Before and After the Flare

In order to ﬁnd out the changes of magnetic energy spatial
distribution before and after the X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930, we
ﬁrst calculate the magnetic energy contained in each layer
volume (one-pixel-high volume beneath each layer, count-
ing from layer 1 [He et al., 2011]) for the two sets of recon-
structed 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁelds associated with M6 and
M7 (observed just before and after the ﬂare eruption), and
then produce the diﬀerence curve of the two sets of mag-
netic energy vertical distributions (i.e., EM 7 − EM 6). The
resulting plot is displayed in Figure 11a.

From the proﬁle of the curve in Figure 11a (vertical distri-
bution of the magnetic energy diﬀerence before and after the

ﬂare), it can be seen that in the lower space of the modeling
volume (below layer 36), the magnetic energy increases, and
the maximum increment is at layer 11, while in the higher
space (above layer 36), the energy decreases. To ﬁnd out
the locations at which the energy density varies, we make
the diﬀerence images of the energy density horizontal distri-
butions at layer 11 (maximum energy increment layer) and
layer 60 (representative layer of energy decreasing), respec-
tively. The two energy density diﬀerence images together
with the Bz image of M7 are also displayed in Figure 11.
The main PIL of M7 is indicated in the Bz image of M7
(Figure 11b) by a thick white line, which is also plotted on
the energy density diﬀerence images (Figures 11c and 11d)
to show the positions of energy density increasing and de-
creasing more clearly.

As demonstrated in Figures 11c and 11d, the region of
magnetic energy density increasing within the lower layers
is located just above the main PIL of the photospheric mag-
netogram (see Figure 11c), and the region of energy den-
sity decreasing in the higher space is also above the main
PIL, though with diﬀerent shape and orientation (see Fig-
ure 11d). The position of the main PIL is where the X3.4
ﬂare of AR 10930 happened [Schrijver et al., 2008], thus the
variations of the magnetic energy spatial distributions shown
in Figure 11 are directly related with the ﬂare eruption.

In Figure 11c, the gray scale for the energy density dif-

ference map at layer 11 saturates at 4.0 × 1027erg/L3

pixel

X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930 in the central area of the active region. The data of the four ﬁltergrams were
acquired by Hinode/SOT at 13 December 2006 02:16:37 UT (2 min after the ﬂare start), 02:18:37 UT,
02:20:37 UT, and 02:22:37 UT, respectively. The images of the four ﬁltergrams have been corrected for
the projection eﬀect and are coaligned with the Hinode/SOT-SP magnetograms. The capital letters A
and B in the images denote the two ﬂare ribbons. The thick black arrows in Figures 12a and 12b indicate
the initial eruptive structures during the ﬂare onset phase, which manifest as the thin straight ﬁbres in
the ﬁltergrams. The capital letter C in the images denotes the location of the ﬂare initial eruption as
inferred from the initial eruptive structures and the two ﬂare ribbons.

(Lpixel representing the length of 1 pixel). Inside the sat-
uration area, the distribution of the energy density dif-
ference is illustrated by two contour lines (contour levels,
6.0 × 1027, 12.0 × 1027erg/L3
pixel), and the inner contour line
encloses the region with the highest values of energy density
increase. The two contour lines are also plotted in Figure
11b (Bz image of M7).

As shown in Figure 11b, the site with the highest values of
energy density increase at layer 11 is just above a small area
around the narrow negative ﬂux patch in the photospheric
magnetogram M7 (see section 3.1 and Figures 5b and 5d for
description and clear images of the negative ﬂux patch).

4. Comparison With the Flare Onset
Imaging Observation

The analyses of the 3-D distributions of the coronal phys-
ical measures in section 3 for the nine sets of reconstructed
coronal magnetic ﬁeld data associated with the X3.4 ﬂare
of AR 10930 manifest the distinct variations of the coronal
magnetic ﬁelds before and after the ﬂare. In this section, we
compare the distribution variations of the coronal physical
measures before and after the ﬂare as shown in Figures 9
and 11 with the ﬂare onset imaging observation to investi-
gate the spatial relationship between the site of the distinct
variations of the coronal physical measures and the location
of the ﬂare initial eruption.

The ﬂare images selected for the comparison are four Ca
ii H line (396.85 nm) ﬁltergrams of ﬂare onset and rising

phase observed by Hinode/SOT [Tsuneta et al., 2008] at 13
December 2006 02:16:37 UT (2 min after the ﬂare start),
02:18:37 UT, 02:20:37 UT, and 02:22:37 UT, respectively, in
which the initial eruptive structures during the ﬂare onset
phase and the two ﬂare ribbons can be identiﬁed clearly.
We perform the similar procedure of projection eﬀect cor-
rection as in section 2.2 on the Ca ii H images to achieve the
co-alignment with the magnetograms. The four projection-
eﬀect-corrected and aligned Ca ii H images in the central
area of the active region are shown in Figure 12. The two
ﬂare ribbons are denoted by the capital letters A and B,
respectively, for all the images in Figure 12. The initial
eruptive structures, which manifest as the thin straight ﬁ-
bres during the ﬂare onset phase, are indicated by the thick
black arrows in Figures 12a and 12b. The capital letter C in
Figure 12 denotes the location of the ﬂare initial eruption as
inferred from the eruptive structures during the ﬂare onset
phase and the two ﬂare ribbons.

In Figure 13, we compare the Ca ii H image observed on
13 December 2006 at 02:16:37 UT (as Figure 13a, ﬂare onset
phase, also shown in Figure 12a) with the current density
distribution image associated with M7 (as Figure 13d, after
ﬂare), the α distribution image on layer 2 associated with
M7 (as Figure 13e, after ﬂare), and the energy density dif-
ference image at layer 11 between EM 6 and EM 7 (as Figure
13f, before and after ﬂare) in the central area of the active
region. The Bz contour image and gray scale image of M7
(observed just after the ﬂare eruption) are included in Figure

data (0.25(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel) of M7, and the gray scale saturates at ±1800 G. (d) Current density distribution

shown in Figure 11c (contour levels, 6.0 × 1027, 12.0 × 1027erg/L3
pixel) are also plotted in Figures 13a and
13b and 13d–13f to demonstrate the spatial correlations between the features of the individual images.
The thick white arrows in Figures 13a–13c indicate the breaking site of the strong magnetic connectivity
as shown in Figure 9. The capital letter C in Figures 13a and 13c indicates the location of the ﬂare initial

the current density distribution associated with M7 shown

13d–13f to demonstrate the spatial correlations between the
features of the individual images. The thick white arrows in
Figures 13a–13c indicate the breaking site of the magnetic
connectivity revealed by the distribution variations of α and
current density before and after the ﬂare as shown in Figure
9. The capital letter C in Figures 13a and 13c indicates the
location of the ﬂare initial eruption inferred from the Ca ii
H images as shown in Figure 12.

In Figure 13a, it can be seen that both the breaking site
of magnetic connectivity (indicated by the thick white arrow
and the isogram of current density in Figure 13a) and the
site with the highest values of energy density increase before
and after the ﬂare (EM 7 − EM 6, indicated by the inner con-
tour line of the energy density diﬀerence map in Figure 13a)
coincide with the location of the ﬂare initial eruption (indi-
cated by the capital letter C in Figure 13a). In Figure 13c,
it can be seen that the location of the ﬂare initial eruption
(indicated by the thick white arrow and the capital letter
C in Figure 13c) is just above the north edge of the narrow
negative ﬂux patch in the photospheric magnetogram M7
(see section 3.1 and Figures 5b and 5d for description and
more clear images of the negative ﬂux patch).

as the thin black arrow in Figure 14f is plotted in Figures 14b, 14d, and 14h to show the location and
coverage area of the cramped positive α region on these images.

5. Discussion
5.1. What Causes the Broken Magnetic Connectivity

The distribution variations of α and current density
shown in section 3.3 reveal a distinct change of magnetic
connectivity in the low corona of AR 10930 during the X3.4
ﬂare. There exists a strong α and strong current density
magnetic connectivity along the main PIL of the active re-

gion before the ﬂare, and the strong magnetic connectiv-
ity is totally broken after the ﬂare eruption (see Figure 9).
Since the variations of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld are the
responses to the variations of the photospheric vector mag-
netic ﬁeld [He et al., 2011], this breaking of magnetic con-
nectivity in the low corona should be driven by the magnetic
ﬁeld changes in the photosphere.

HE ET AL.: CORONAL MAGNETIC FIELD OF AR 10930 FLARE

X - 17

As shown in Figure 9b (see also Figures 13b and 13c), the
breaking site of the strong magnetic connectivity is just over
a local area featured by the narrow negative ﬂux patch that
appears in the photospheric magnetogram M7 (see section
3.1 for description of the negative ﬂux patch), or more ex-
actly, the north edge of the narrow patch as shown in Figure
13c. Considering the counterclockwise rotation of the main
positive polarity of AR 10930 (see Figures 5a and 5c), it can
be inferred that it is the appearance of this negative ﬂux
patch along with the motion of the main positive polarity
in the photosphere that leads to the breaking of the strong
magnetic connectivity in the low corona.

To verify this conclusion, we compare the α distributions
around the main PIL on layer 0 (bottom layer, representing
the photosphere) and layer 2 for the data associated with
M6 and M7 (observed just before and after the ﬂare erup-
tion). The resulting images are shown in Figure 14 (third
and fourth row). The Bz contour images and gray scale
images of M6 and M7 are also included in Figure 14 (ﬁrst
and second row) for reference. From the α image on layer 0
associated with M7 (Figure 14f), it can be found that in the
central area of the image, there exists a long cramped region
(indicated by a thin black arrow) in which the α values are
positive (displayed by blue color in Figure 14f). An isogram
of the positive α distribution in Figure 14f, which can repre-
sent the location and coverage area of the cramped positive
α region, is plotted on the Bz images of M7 (Figures 14b
and 14d) and the α image on layer 2 associated with M7
(Figure 14h). In Figures 14b and 14d, it can be seen that
the cramped region with positive α values is just located at
the north edge of the narrow negative ﬂux patch over which
the breaking of the magnetic connectivity happens. In Fig-
ure 14h, it can be seen that the position of the cramped
positive α region coincides with the separation line between
the two branches of the broken magnetic connectivity.

Considering its positive α values, the magnetic connec-
tivity property of the cramped region shown in Figure 14f
is diﬀerent from the surrounding area where the negative
α values dominate. Along with the counterclockwise rota-
tion of the main positive polarity in the photosphere, this
cramped positive α region moves into the ﬁeld where the
strong magnetic connectivity resides before the ﬂare, splits
the strong magnetic connectivity during the ﬂare eruption,
and causes the broken magnetic connectivity conﬁguration
after the ﬂare.

The injection of positive α into the existing negative α
region in AR 10930 is consistent with the result obtained
by Park et al. [2010] in terms of magnetic helicity and the
result obtained by Inoue et al. [2012] in terms of magnetic
twists.

5.2. Scenario for the Initial Eruption of the Flare

The spatial coincidence of the breaking site of the strong
magnetic connectivity and the location of the ﬂare initial
eruption (see Figure 13 and description in section 4) implies
that it is the breaking of the magnetic connectivity that in-
duces the initial plasma ejection of the ﬂare. The process can
be understood as follows: The breaking of the strong mag-
netic connectivity let the corona system become nonequilib-
rium and causes isolated electric current at the breaking site.
The isolated electric current is the residual and variant of
the strong current (associated with the strong magnetic con-
nectivity) before the ﬂare, which is not compatible with the
broken magnetic conﬁguration and thus isolated. To achieve
a new equilibrium state, this part of excess (isolated) elec-
tric current and the associated plasmas must be expelled
from the corona system, then the initial plasma ejection of
the ﬂare happens. The ejected plasmas in turn cause fur-
ther magnetic reconnections and postﬂare loops [Shibata and
Magara, 2011].

The diagram of this scenario for the ﬂare initial eruption
is shown in Figure 15. The conﬁguration of the strong mag-
netic connectivity before the ﬂare (represented by a thick

black line) is sketched in Figure 15a (corresponding to the
state associated with M6, see Figure 15b). Note that the
current density vector and the magnetic ﬁeld vector asso-
ciated with the strong magnetic connectivity have opposite
directions since the local distribution of force-free factor α
shows apparent negative values (see description in section
3.3.1). The conﬁguration of the broken magnetic connectiv-
ity after the ﬂare (represented by two thick dotted lines, see
Appendix B for ﬁeld lines conﬁgurations) is sketched in Fig-
ure 15e (corresponding to the state associated with M7, see
Figure 15f). The nonequilibrium state of the initial eruption
of the ﬂare is sketched in Figure 15c (also shown in Figure
15d over the magnetogram and isogram of α associated with
M7).

As illustrated in Figures 15c and 15d, while the broken
conﬁguration of the magnetic connectivity has just been
formed, there exists isolated electric current (residual and
variant of the strong current before the ﬂare, represented by
a thick white line in Figures 15c and 15d) between the two
branches of the broken magnetic connectivity, and the ori-
entation of the isolated electric current is not parallel to the
direction of the surrounding ambient magnetic ﬁeld which is
represented by a thin black arrow in Figure 15d (associated
with the broken magnetic conﬁguration, see Appendix B
for details about the magnetic ﬁeld direction). Note that
Figures 15c and 15d correspond to nonequilibrium state
and thus force-free constraint can be violated, then there
is Lorentz force at play. As demonstrated in Figure 15c, it
is the Lorentz force (represented by an upward thick black
arrow) acting on the isolated electric current at the magnetic
connectivity breaking site that lifts the associated plasmas
and causes the initial plasma ejection. The two branches of
the broken magnetic connectivity (the two thick dotted lines
in Figure 15c) together with the isolated electric current at
the magnetic connectivity breaking site (the thick white line
in Figure 15c) show a Z-shaped conﬁguration (see also Fig-
ure 15d).

It should be noted that the broken magnetic connectivity
is a 3-D structure (see Appendix A for the vertical distri-
butions of α and current density). Not only the lower core
magnetic ﬁeld at the breaking site but also the overlying
magnetic structure is disrupted along with the breaking of
the magnetic connectivity. Between the two branches of
the broken magnetic connectivity is a localized yet opened
magnetic channel (see Figures A1d and A1f). The isolated
electric current and the associated plasmoid at the magnetic
connectivity breaking site can be ejected along the channel
straightforwardly by the Lorentz force as described in the
above scenario.

5.3. Redistribution of Magnetic Energy Before and
After the Flare

The results in section 3.4 show that the total magnetic
energy of AR 10930 is always in changing along with the
evolution of the 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld. As displayed in
Table 2 and Figure 10, the diﬀerence between the maximum
and minimum values of the total magnetic energy (ENLFFF)
is 4.39 × 1032 erg (EM 4 − EM 7), whereas the total mag-
netic energy change before and after the ﬂare eruption is
1.17 × 1032 erg (EM 6 − EM 7), which is only a small fraction
of the maximum range of the total energy ﬂuctuation.

By investigating the changes of the magnetic energy spa-
tial distributions before and after the ﬂare, we have a diﬀer-
ent view of the variation of magnetic energy. The magnetic
energy in the modeling volume is not uniformly increasing
or decreasing before and after the ﬂare. Instead, in the lower

on the isolated electric current which lifts the associated plasmas and causes the initial plasma ejection.
(e and f) Equilibrium state of the broken magnetic connectivity after the ﬂare and the corresponding
photospheric magnetogram M7 and isogram of α on layer 2. The thin black arrows in Figures 15d and
15f indicate the representative direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking site
after the ﬂare (see Appendix B for details). The contour level for the isograms of α in Figures 15b, 15d,
and 15f is −0.15 Mm−1.

space of the modeling volume the energy increasing domi-
nates, while in the higher space the energy decreasing domi-
nates (see Figure 11). That is, there exists magnetic energy
redistribution before and after the ﬂare. The value of the
total magnetic energy reduction (1.17 × 1032 erg) is the net
eﬀect of the magnetic energy increasing and decreasing in
the diﬀerent regions of the modeling space. Compared with
the time variation of the integrated values of total magnetic
energy (which is useful to evaluate the total energy budget
for solar eruptive events), the characteristic of magnetic en-

ergy redistribution can provide more detailed information
about the energy release process during the ﬂare eruption.
The magnetic energy distribution is decided by the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength distribution as shown in equation (7),
and the strength distributions of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld
is related with the spatial conﬁgurations of the coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld.
In the common sense, the compact ﬁeld lines
correspond to strong magnetic ﬁeld and high magnetic pres-
sure, and the separating ﬁeld lines correspond to the de-
crease of magnetic ﬁeld strength and magnetic pressure.

of current density on the assigned vertical slice. The absolute values of current density are employed to

Then the magnetic energy redistribution shown in Figure
11 also demonstrates the dynamic changes of the spatial
conﬁgurations of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. For example,
the increase of magnetic energy in the lower space implies
more compact closed ﬁeld lines, and the decrease of mag-
netic energy in the higher space implies a relaxation of the
magnetic ﬁeld.

Jing et al. [2008] used magnetic shear to investigate the
spatial conﬁgurations of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds before

and after the X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930. They calculated the
weighted mean magnetic shear angle at each layer in a local
volume above the main PIL and found that the magnetic
shear after the ﬂare increases below 8 Mm and decreases
above that height. The height of 8 Mm corresponds to 11(cid:48)(cid:48)
(1(cid:48)(cid:48) ∼ 714 km), which coincides with the maximum energy
density increment layer in this work (see Figure 11 and de-
scription in section 3.4.2). The relation between the varia-
tions of the magnetic energy distribution and the variations
of the spatial conﬁguration of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld

6. Summary and Conclusion

In this paper, the 3-D coronal magnetic ﬁeld and its vari-
ations associated with the X3.4-class solar ﬂare event of
AR 10930 are studied. The time series 3-D coronal mag-

netic ﬁeld data associated with the ﬂare were reconstructed
based on the NLFFF model and by using the extrapolation
method developed in our previous work [He et al., 2011; He
and Wang, 2008]. The bottom boundaries for the NLFFF
extrapolations are nine photospheric vector magnetograms
obtained by the Hinode/SOT-SP instrument within the time
interval of 3 days, six magnetograms were observed before
the ﬂare, and three magnetograms were observed after the
ﬂare. The reconstructed coronal magnetic ﬁeld data are
analyzed through three quantitative physical measures, 3-
D force-free factor α, 3-D electric current density, and 3-D

magnetic energy density. We use the distribution of force-
free factor α together with the distribution of electric current
density to reﬂect the internal variation of the magnetic con-
nectivity in the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. For the magnetic
energy analysis, we emphasize the spatial distribution vari-
ation of the 3-D magnetic energy density before and after
the ﬂare.

The distribution variations of force-free factor α and elec-
tric current density reveal a clear change of magnetic con-
nectivity in the low corona of AR 10930 before and after the
X3.4 ﬂare. There exists a prominent magnetic connectiv-
ity with strong negative α values and strong current density
magnitude before the ﬂare which extends along the main
PIL of the active region, and this strong magnetic connec-
tivity is found to be totally broken after the ﬂare eruption.
The comparison with the ﬂare onset imaging observation
shows that the breaking site of the strong magnetic connec-
tivity coincide with the location of the ﬂare initial eruption,
which is just over the north edge of a narrow negative ﬂux
patch that appears in the photospheric magnetogram ob-
served just after the ﬂare (the magnetogram labeled M7 in
this paper). By examining the α distribution associated
with M7 on the photosphere, it is found that there exists a
long cramped region with positive α values at the north edge
of the negative ﬂux patch, which has diﬀerent property of
magnetic connectivity compared with the surrounding area
where the negative α values dominate. We conclude that
it is the appearance of this cramped positive α region that
cuts oﬀ the strong magnetic connectivity before the ﬂare
and cause the broken magnetic connectivity after the ﬂare
eruption. Moreover, considering the spatial coincidence of
the breaking site of the strong magnetic connectivity and
the location of the ﬂare initial eruption, we propose a sce-
nario (sketched in Figure 15) to interpret the initial plasma
ejection of the ﬂare by the breaking of the strong magnetic
connectivity. As illustrated in Figure 15, it is the Lorentz
force acting on the isolated electric current at the magnetic
connectivity breaking site that lifts the associated plasmas
and causes the initial plasma ejection.

The spatial distribution variation of the 3-D magnetic en-
ergy density in AR 10930 reveals the redistribution of mag-
netic energy before and after the X3.4 ﬂare. The redistri-
bution means the magnetic energy contained in the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld is not uniformly increasing or decreasing. In-
stead, in some regions the magnetic energy density increase
and in other regions the energy density decreases. By exam-
ining the diﬀerence data of the 3-D magnetic energy density
distributions just before and after the ﬂare eruption, it is
found that in the lower space of the modeling volume the
increase of magnetic energy dominates and in the higher
space the decrease of energy dominates. The region of mag-
netic energy density increasing within the lower layers is
just above the main PIL of the photospheric magnetogram
where the X3.4 ﬂare happened. The comparison with the
ﬂare onset imaging observation and the distribution varia-
tions of α and current density shows that the site with the
highest values of energy density increase at layer 11 (max-
imum energy increment layer) coincides with the location
of the ﬂare initial eruption as well as the breaking site of
the strong magnetic connectivity mentioned above. The in-
crease of the magnetic energy density around the breaking
site of the magnetic connectivity can be interpreted by an
enhancement of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the local re-
gion, which can also interpret the magnitude increase of the
current density in the same region after the ﬂare.

In the next step of this work, we plan to compare the
variations of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld associated with the
X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930 with more observations obtained
by various space-based and ground-based instruments [Mi-
noshima et al., 2009; Shibasaki, 2012], such as the UV and
EUV images by the TRACE satellite [Handy et al., 1999],

soft X-ray images by the X-ray Telescope of Hinode satel-
lite (Hinode/XRT) [Golub, 2007], hard X-ray images by the
Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) satellite [Lin et al., 2002], and the ground-based
Nobeyama Radioheliograph images [Nakajima et al., 1994],
which can be helpful to having more in-depth understand-
ings on the detailed processes of the X3.4 ﬂare and the as-
sociated CME. The coronal physical measures employed in
this work can also be the additional quantitative basis for
the short-term forecasting of major solar ﬂare event [Leka
and Barnes, 2007; He et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009].

Appendix A: Vertical Distributions of the
Force-Free Factor α and Electric Current
Density

A slice in the 3-D coronal data grid which is parallel to the
Y -Z plane and at 125(cid:48)(cid:48) on X axis is employed to illustrate
the vertical distribution of force-free factor α and electric
current density in AR 10930 before and after the X3.4 ﬂare.
The location of the slice is carefully selected to cross the
breaking site of the strong magnetic connectivity described
in section 3.3.3. The resulting images of the α and current
density vertical distributions corresponding to M6 and M7
(observed just before and after the ﬂare eruption) on the
assigned slice are shown in Figure A1. To display the ver-
tical distributions of α more clearly, the range of the color
scale for α in Figures A1c and A1d is set as [−0.2, +0.2]
Mm−1, which is smaller than the color scale range adopted
in other α ﬁgures ([−0.3, +0.3] Mm−1). The vertical dis-
tribution images of current density in Figures A1e and A1f
use the absolute values of current density on the assigned
slice, which are diﬀerent from the current density maps (see
deﬁnition in section 3.3.2) adopted in other current density
ﬁgures.

In the main part of this paper, we only show the horizon-
tal distribution of α on layer 2. In Figure A2, we further
display the α distributions on layer 1, layer 3, layer 5, and
layer 7 of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld data corresponding to
M6 and M7 in the central area of the active region, which
together with Figures A1c and A1d demonstrate the sharp
decline of the α values with increase in height.

Appendix B: Magnetic Field Conﬁgurations
Associated With the Strong α Regions
Before and After the Flare

The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations associated with the re-
gions with strong α and strong current density values be-
fore and after the X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930 (corresponding to
M6 and M7) are investigated through the conﬁgurations of
closed ﬁeld lines and the distributions of vector magnetic
ﬁeld on layer 2 of the reconstructed 3-D coronal magnetic
ﬁeld data. The resulting images in the central area of the
active region and around the breaking site of the magnetic
connectivity (see description in section 3.3) are shown in
Figure B1. The left column in Figure B1 is for the images
before the ﬂare (corresponding to M6), and the right col-
umn is for the images after the ﬂare (corresponding to M7).
The ﬁrst row in Figure B1 displays the images of the closed
ﬁeld lines, the second row displays the images of the vector
magnetic ﬁelds on layer 2 of the reconstructed coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld data, and the third row gives the images of the α
distributions on layer 2 for reference.

Only the closed ﬁeld lines lower than layer 5 are displayed
in Figures B1a and B1b. Field lines with strong α values
(|α| ≥ 0.15 Mm−1 or α ≤ −0.15 Mm−1) are plotted in white
color, and ﬁeld lines with |α| < 0.15 Mm−1 are plotted in

after the ﬂare corresponding to M7. (a and b) Closed ﬁeld lines images before and after the ﬂare. The
ﬁeld lines are plotted overlying the Bz contour images of the corresponding photospheric magnetograms.
Only the closed ﬁeld lines lower than layer 5 are displayed. Field lines with strong α values (|α| ≥ 0.15
Mm−1 or α ≤ −0.15 Mm−1) are plotted in white color, and ﬁeld lines with |α| < 0.15 Mm−1 are plotted
in black color. The two thick dotted lines in Figure B1b outline the conﬁgurations of the two ﬁeld line
bundles after the ﬂare. (c and d) Vector magnetic ﬁeld images on layer 2 of the reconstructed coronal
magnetic ﬁeld data before and after the ﬂare. The white contours represent the positive polarity of Bz
on layer 2, and the black contours represent the negative polarity of Bz on layer 2. The contour levels
for Bz are ±50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 G. Small arrows overlying the contours represent the
transverse ﬁeld components on layer 2. The long black arrows in Figures B1c and B1d, which correspond
to M6 and M7, respectively, indicate the azimuths of the magnetic ﬁeld vectors at the selected ﬁeld point
(X = 125(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = 69.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) on layer 2. The two arrows are also plotted in other images according to their
corresponding magnetograms. (e and f) Distribution images of α on layer 2 before and after the ﬂare.
The white contour lines in Figures B1e and B1f represent the isograms of α (contour level, −0.15 Mm−1)
that correspond to M6 and M7, respectively. The two isograms are also plotted in other images according
to their corresponding magnetograms.

black color. The isogram of the α distribution on layer 2
corresponding to M6 is plotted overlying the images in Fig-
ures B1a, B1c, and B1e (left column) to display the location
of the strong α region before the ﬂare. The isogram of α cor-
responding to M7 (after the ﬂare) is plotted overlying the
images in Figures B1b, B1d, and B1f (right column). The
contour level for the α isograms is −0.15 Mm−1.

It can be seen in Figures B1a and B1b that the closed
ﬁeld lines conﬁgurations can well demonstrate the distinct

change of magnetic connectivity before and after the ﬂare.
In Figure B1a (before the ﬂare) the ﬁeld lines are concen-
trated in one bundle, in Figure B1b (after the ﬂare) the ﬁeld
lines are broken into two bundles, and the orientations and
locations of the ﬁeld line bundles roughly coincide with the
magnetic connectivity conﬁgurations manifested by the α
distributions before and after the ﬂare (represented by the
isograms of α in Figure B1).
In Figure B1b, we use two
thick dotted lines to outline the conﬁgurations of the two

bundles of ﬁeld lines, which are employed in Figure 15 (see
section 5.2) as the representative conﬁguration of the broken
magnetic connectivity.

In Figures B1c and B1d it can be seen that the direc-
tions of the magnetic ﬁelds in the strong α regions are
roughly aligned along the stretching orientations of the mag-
netic connectivities. We select a representative ﬁeld point
(X = 125(cid:48)(cid:48), Y = 69.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) at the breaking site of the mag-
netic connectivity and let the azimuths of the magnetic ﬁeld
vectors at this point on layer 2 as the representative direc-
tions of the magnetic connectivities in the strong α regions.
The representative magnetic ﬁeld direction for the strong
magnetic connectivity before the ﬂare is shown in Figures
B1a, B1c, and B1e (left column) by long black arrows at the
selected ﬁeld point. The representative magnetic ﬁeld direc-
tion for the broken magnetic connectivity after the ﬂare is
shown in Figures B1b, B1d, and B1f (right column) by long
black arrow as well, but with southward deﬂection compared
with the arrows in the left column of Figure B1. The rep-
resentative directions for the magnetic connectivities before
and after the ﬂare (corresponding to M6 and M7) are em-
ployed in Figure 9 (see section 3.3.3) and Figure 15 (see
section 5.2).
