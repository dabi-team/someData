ABSTRACT

We present the study of three homologous solar eruptions from NOAA active region (AR) 11429 over
four days. This large and complex AR divided into two relatively simple sub-regions: northeast (NE)
and southwest (SW). Recurrent eruptions occurred from the SW sub-region over diﬀerent evolutionary
phases, which provided a unique opportunity to isolate the physical processes responsible for solar
eruptions. Persistent shearing and convergence of opposite magnetic polarities led to continuous ﬂux
cancellation along the SW polarity inversion line (PIL). A ﬁlament persistently lying along the SW-PIL
was observed to survive each eruption, which suggests the partial eruption of the magnetic system.
Further, following the ﬁrst and second eruptions, a sigmoidal magnetic structure of similar morphology
was reformed along the SW-PIL. The photospheric motion of magnetic ﬂux continuously injected and
stored the negative helicity in the partially erupted magnetic system and built up the magnetic free
energy for the successive eruptions. These results suggest that the shearing motion and magnetic ﬂux
cancellation of opposite ﬂuxes were: (1) the dominant factor, irrespective of the evolutionary phase,
that contributed to the recurrent homologous eruption, and (2) the key processes of forming the
erupting structure, likely a magnetic ﬂux rope, and its long-lasting continuation results in reformation
of identical erupting structure. The study also ﬁnds that similar magnetic topology could result in the
magnetic reconnection at the same location, and such ﬂares during the precursor phase would help in
the eruption by decreasing the constraint of overlying magnetic ﬁeld.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar eruptions, manifested as ﬂares and Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are the most spectacular phenomena
happening on the solar corona. Besides being magniﬁcent, these are the main sources of the disturbances in the inter-
planetary space and also the space weather eﬀects near the Earth. Flares and CMEs (often occur together) are probably
the manifestation of a single energy release process, during which a tremendous amount of stored magnetic energy is
released from the solar atmosphere (see, Forbes 2000; Zhang et al. 2001). The general model of solar eruptions, also
known as CSHKP model (initially developed by Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman
1976), describes the process as the eruption of magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) through magnetic reconnection. An MFR
is a highly sheared and twisted magnetic ﬁeld structure and carries a large amount of free magnetic energy. It is kept
under equilibrium by the magnetic pressure of the overlying magnetic ﬁelds and its instability makes it to rise. While
rising it drags the overlying magnetic ﬁeld lines, making them to come close to each other in an anti-parallel manner
below it and form a current sheet. The magnetic reconnection at current sheet results in ﬂares and the new connection
removes the overlying constrain over MFR and accelerate it (see, Forbes 2000; Chen 2011 for review). As long as

there is an erupting MFR, the general theory describes the evolution of solar eruptions very well. However, it does
not address the initial formation of MFRs and onset of solar eruptions.

Many agree with the notion that the MFR is an essential feature for solar eruption. However, there is a debate
regarding when, how and where it is formed. It can exist before (e.g., Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Zhang et al. 2012) or form
during solar eruption (e.g., Antiochos et al. 1999; Cheng et al. 2011). Its detection before the eruption is a diﬃcult task,
due to low plasma density and technological insuﬃciency to measure magnetic ﬁeld directly in the corona. Nevertheless,
its existence is suggested through sigmoidal bright loops in X-rays (Rust & Kumar 1996; Green et al. 2007), AIA/SDO
hot-channel structures (Cheng et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012), dips or bald patches in ﬁlament channels (Lites 2005;
L´opez Ariste et al. 2006), and nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation results (e.g., Chintzoglou et al. 2015).
Several mechanisms are associated with its formation, such as ﬂux emergence (e.g. Fan & Gibson 2003; Leake et al.
2013), shearing motion between opposite magnetic ﬂuxes (e.g., Amari et al. 2000, 2003; Jacobs et al. 2009), magnetic
ﬂux cancellation along the polarity inversion lines (PILs) (e.g., van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989; Aulanier et al. 2010;
Green et al. 2011), and conﬁned ﬂaring (e.g., Patsourakos et al. 2013, Chintzoglou et al. 2015).

A typical solar eruption has three phases: (1) the precursor phase (PP), (2) the impulsive phase (IP), and (3) the
gradual phase (GP; see, Zhou et al. 2016 for discussion); these are associated with three distinct acceleration phases
of CMEs (Zhang et al. 2001). PP is important to understand the initiation and validating diﬀerent models of solar
eruptions. In the past, diﬀerent observational signatures have been identiﬁed in precursor phase for certain individual
events, such as: soft X-rays (SXR) emission (F´arn´ık et al. 1996; F´arn´ık & Savy 1998), hard X-rays burst (Harra et al.
2001), UV/EUV brightenings (e.g., Joshi et al. 2011; Awasthi et al. 2014), type II radio bursts (e.g., Klassen et al.
2003; Liu et al. 2007), prominence oscillation (Chen et al. 2008) and MFR oscillation (Zhou et al. 2016). However,
due to weak or entirely absent observational activities during precursor phase its current understanding is very poor
compared to IP and GP (Hudson 2011).

Most of the time, single and independent solar eruption happens on the Sun. However, there are cases where
multiple eruptions occur in a short time-span. Such eruptions are known as sympathetic eruptions. These could occur
in diﬀerent active regions (ARs) or at diﬀerent locations within the same complex AR. Although interrelation among
these is a debatable issue (see, Biesecker & Thompson 2000), but causal relationship have been identiﬁed in many
cases (e.g., Schrijver & Title 2011; T¨or¨ok et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2009).

Besides sympathetic eruptions, multiple eruptions could happen from the same local region consecutively. Con-
secutive CMEs originating from the same region, associated with homologous ﬂares, having similar coronographic
appearance and similar dimming in extreme ultraviolet imaging are known as homologous CMEs (Zhang & Wang
2002). Homologous eruptions are possible only if there are mechanisms that continuously store magnetic energy in the
same local region. Therefore, their studies are important to understand the long-term magnetic energy build-up in the
corona. In the past, they have been studied either during magnetic ﬂux emergence phase and were considered due to
ﬂux emergence (e.g. Nitta & Hudson 2001; Chatterjee & Fan 2013) or ﬂux decaying phase and were considered due to
shearing motion and magnetic ﬂux cancellation (e.g., Li et al. 2010; Vemareddy 2017a). The persistent photospheric
horizontal motion of magnetic structure along the PIL was also considered to produce homologous eruptions (e.g.,
Romano et al. 2015; Romano et al. 2018). Past studies also suggest that homologous eruptions can be triggered by
similar mechanisms, such as moving magnetic features (Zhang & Wang 2002), coronal null point magnetic conﬁgura-
tion (e.g., DeVore & Antiochos 2008) and shearing motion and magnetic reconnection (e.g., Vemareddy 2017a)

In this paper, we analyze three homologous eruptions, viz., SOL2012-03-07T01:05, SOL2012-03-09T03:22, and
SOL2012-03-10T16:50. These eruptions originated from the same location in the complex AR 11429, but at dif-
ferent magnetic ﬂux evolutionary phase. An MFR of similar morphology was formed, along the same PIL, before each
of the three eruptions. Magnetic ﬂux cancellation led by the shearing and converging motion and new connectivity in
the corona were responsible for its formation. A conﬁned ﬂare was observed during the PP of each eruption, which
helped in the eruption by weakening the constraint of overlying magnetic ﬁelds. The paper is structured as follows.
Instrument and data are described in Section 2. The precursor phase and each eruption are described in Section 3.
Evolution of the AR before each eruption and pre-eruptive coronal magnetic structures are described in Section 4, and
the discussion and conclusion are presented in Section 5.

This study mainly used the data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012), onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO ; Pesnell et al. 2012).

The AIA provides full-disk images of the Sun with unprecedented temporal cadence (12 s) and spatial resolution (1.′′2).
The diﬀerent spectral bands of AIA observe the Sun from the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona up to 0.5 R⊙
above the solar limb. The HMI provides the photospheic line-of-sight and vector magnetic ﬁeld observations at a
cadence of 45 s and 720 s respectively. The SDO has an inclined geosynchronous orbit around the Earth. During two
seasons of each year, the view of the SDO gets obscured by the Earth temporarily each day for two-three weeks (SDO
eclipse; Pesnell et al. 2012). In this study, we focused on the SDO observation during the solar front disk passage of
the NOAA AR 11429 from 2012 March 6, 00:00 UT to 2012 March 10, 19:00 UT. There were some data-gaps during
the observational period due to SDO eclipse. In addition, we used observations from the Large Angle Spectrometric
Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO ), white light
images of the Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI; Howard et al. 2008) onboard
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO ; Kaiser et al. 2008), Hα image from Big Bear Solar Observatory
(BBSO; Denker et al. 1999), X-ray Telescope (XRT; Golub et al. 2007) onboard the Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007),
and the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI; Hill et al. 2005 and Pizzo et al. 2005) on board the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES).

3. OBSERVATIONS OF THE HOMOLOGOUS ERUPTIONS
The NOAA AR 11429 was initially emerged on the backside and appeared on the eastern limb of the Sun on 2012
March 4. During its front disk transition, the AR acquired very complex magnetic-conﬁguration (β/γ/δ), with many
small magnetic polarities (see Elmhamdi et al. 2014 for more details about the evolution of magnetic conﬁguration).
However, as discussed in Chintzoglou et al. 2015 and Dhakal et al. 2018, it could be divided into two relatively simpler
sub-regions namely: northeast (NE) and southwest (SW) sub-regions, more discussed in the section 4.1. Also, it had an
anti-hale magnetic conﬁguration i.e., the leading magnetic polarity (positive) was opposite of the normal hemispheric
trend (negative). Both δ and anti-hale magnetic conﬁguration are identiﬁable with severe ﬂaring activity (e.g., Zirin
1970; Tanaka 1991; Sammis et al. 2000). Indeed, it was super-ﬂare productive. Most of the ﬂares were observed before
it crossed the central meridian on March 9. By the end of March 9, it had produced 3 X-class, 11 M-class, and 30
C-class ﬂares. Afterward, there were only 2 M-class ﬂares and 7 C-class ﬂares. The events under study occurred in
the SW sub-region in the interval of ∼4 days. These homologous eruptions are summarized in Table 1.

The ﬁrst solar eruption occurred on 2012 March 7 at ∼01:05 UT when the AR was in the north-east quadrant of
the solar disk. On March 7, within one hour, there were two solar eruptions viz., SOL2012-03-07T00:02 (shown in
red dotted line in Figure 1(a)) and SOL2012-03-07T01:05 (shown in black line in Figure 1(a)) from the NE and SW
sub-regions respectively (see Chintzoglou et al. 2015). Here, we study the eruption from the SW sub-region. It was
associated with X1.3 class ﬂare and its location was ∼N15E26. Associated ﬂare ribbons were concentrated mainly
on the positive and negative ﬂuxes of the SW sub-region (see Figure 1(d) for observed ﬂare ribbon in AIA 1600 ˚A)
and were observed to move away on either side of the PIL during the MFR eruption. The position and separation of
the ﬂare ribbons indicated that the MFR erupted from the SW-PIL. The eruption led to the coronal mass depletion
in the region and observed as coronal dimming in diﬀerent AIA passbands (e.g. Tian et al. 2012; see Figure 1(g) for
observed dimming in AIA 193 ˚A). Later it was observed as halo CME, moving with 1825 km/s (CDAW CME catalog),
in LASCO white light observation at 01:30 UT. The morphology of the CME at a single time snapshot is not clear due

4

to contamination from the earlier CME. However, its morphology was clear in STEREO-A FOV as eastward-moving
CME and in STEREO-B FOV as westward-moving CME (see upper panels of the Figure 2).

The second solar eruption started on 2012 March 9, at ∼03:22 UT when the AR was located around the central
meridian of the solar disk. It was associated with an M6.3 class ﬂare (see Figure 1(b)) at ∼N15W03. The ﬂare ribbons,
similar to the ribbons of the previous eruption, evolved and concentrated on the opposite magnetic ﬂux in the SW
sub-region (see Figure1(e)). This again indicated that the MFR had erupted from the SW-PIL. A dimming similar
to the previous eruption was observed in EUV observation (see Figure 1(h)) and eventually observed as halo CME in
LASCO C2 at 04:26 UT. In the LASCO FOV CME moved with a linear velocity of 950 km/s. STEREO-A data was
not available during that period, but like the earlier eruption it appeared as westward-moving CME in STEREO-B
FOV (see middle panels of the Figure 2).

The third solar eruption started on 2012 March 10, at ∼ 16:50 UT when the AR was at the north-west quadrant. It
was associated with an M8.4 class ﬂare (see Figure 1(c)) at ∼N17W24. The evolution and separation of ﬂare ribbons

Homologous Solar Eruptions From AR 11429

were similar to the previous two eruptions and they were primarily concentrated on the opposite magnetic ﬂux of the
SW sub-region (see Figure1(f)). Therefore, the third MFR also erupted from the SW-PIL. Observed EUV dimming
was also similar to the previous two eruptions (see Figure 1(i)). It appeared as halo CME in LASCO C2 at 18:00
UT, moving with a linear velocity of 1296 km/s. Like earlier eruptions, it was observed as eastward-moving CME
in STEREO-A, and westward-moving CME in STEREO-B (see the lower panels of Figure 2) with a similar CME
morphology.

All three solar eruptions were originated from the SW-PIL of the AR 11429. The direction of successive CMEs seemed
to move towards north-side in STEREO FOV and this could be due to the change in magnetic ﬂux distribution with
evolution. Nevertheless, the overall morphology of the CMEs appeared similar in each recurring eruptions. Also, the
X-ray proﬁle, evolution of ﬂare ribbons, and EUV dimming associated with these eruptions were nearly identical to
be homologous eruptions. The time diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and the second eruption was ∼50 hours, and the time
diﬀerence between the second and the third eruption was ∼37 hours. The next section discusses the evolution of the
AR that led to identical solar eruptions.

4. EVOLUTION OF AR 11429 LEADING TO HOMOLOGOUS ERUPTIONS

We used the preprocessed cutouts of SHARP data products (hmi.sharp cea 720s) to study the photospheric evo-
lution of the magnetic ﬂux distribution in the AR. Preprocessing resolves the 180◦ azimuthal uncertainty and remaps
helioprojective images into a cylindrical equal-area (CEA) projection, where each pixel has the same surface area
(Hoeksema et al. 2014). Although there were several episodes of new magnetic ﬂux emergence in the early evolution-

6

Dhakal et al.

ary period, no major emergence was observed after March 8, as is evident from the time-proﬁle of magnetic ﬂux of
the AR shown in the Figure 3 (also, see the movie accompanying Figure 4). Here, we used the CEA maps of HMI
LOS-magnetogram to analyze the magnetic ﬂux. The apparent 12-hour periodicity in the plots of magnetic ﬂux (in
Figure 3) is due to instrumental eﬀect and related to spacecraft orbital velocity, also there is a variation of the number
of pixels contributing to the low-to-moderate magnetic ﬁeld values as AR moves from central meridian to the limb
(see, Hoeksema et al. 2014). Solar eruptions under consideration had occurred at the diﬀerent evolutionary phases of
the AR (eruptions are shown by dashed-vertical lines in Figure 3). The ﬁrst eruption had occurred when the total
magnetic ﬂux was increasing i.e. during the magnetic ﬂux emergence phase. The second eruption happened at the end
of the ﬂux emergence phase, and the third eruption happened during the ﬂux decay phase of the AR. In the following,
we describe the evolution of the AR, focusing on SW sub-region, in the period of 2012 March 6 to March 11.

in black, the total negative magnetic ﬂux is plotted in red and the total positive ﬂux is plotted in blue. Dashed vertical lines
marks the time of three homologous solar eruptions.

4.1. Evolution of the Photospheric Magnetic Field

Initial compactness and complexity of the magnetic ﬂux distribution of the AR decreased with its evolution. It was
divided into two simpler sub-regions: NE and SW based on the presence of two erupting MFRs on 2012 March 7
(Chintzoglou et al. 2015) and are shown in red and cyan box respectively in Figure 4(a). The distinction between the
two sub-regions become more clear in the later evolutionary period. Long and sharp strong-gradient PILs, shown in
green asterisks in the left panels of Figure 4 (obtained from an image gradient operation as discussed in Zhang et al.
2010), were present throughout the observational period. The plasma velocity maps show the persistent shearing
motion between opposite magnetic ﬂuxes along the SW-PILs (see the middle panels of Figure 4; also see the movie
accompanying Figure 4 for the plasma velocity). These maps were derived using DAVE4VM method with an apodiza-
tion window of 19 pixels (Schuck 2008). Shearing motions along the PILs are well known to convert potential ﬁeld to
sheared ﬁeld arcade (e.g., van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989). The direction of horizontal magnetic ﬁelds, which were
aligned along the length of PILs (see the right panels of Figure 4), indicated that there was indeed strong non-potential
shear along the PILs. The SW-PIL was lying between two large areas of opposite magnetic polarity i.e., P-SW and
N-SW (see Figure 4(d)). The distance between the centroid of opposite magnetic poles was decreasing with time (see
the plot in black-asterisks in Figure 5). This showed that the opposite magnetic poles were continuously converging
towards each other. The centroid-distance was decreased by ∼1 Mm between ﬁrst and second solar eruptions (from
March 7 to March 9) and by ∼2 Mm between second and third eruptions (from March 9 to March 10). Though the
convergence was observed in both ﬂux emerging and decaying phase, the rate of convergence was increased after the
ﬂux emergence had been stopped. Flux cancellation was not obvious from the plot of the magnetic ﬂux of the entire
AR and it was hard to isolate the SW sub-region completely. However, after March 6 it was possible to isolate the
negative polarity of the SW sub-region. Therefore we encompassed the negative polarity with an ellipse and ellipse
was varying with time to make sure that it fully encompassed the negative polarity all the time, and analyzed it. The
plot in red asterisks in Figure 5 shows the time-proﬁle of negative ﬂux in the SW sub-region. The negative ﬂux was
decreasing gradually, indicating a continuous ﬂux cancellation in the SW sub-region. Though the rate of convergence

Homologous Solar Eruptions From AR 11429

7

was increased after the second eruption on March 9, there was no signiﬁcant change in the slope of the negative
magnetic ﬂux, which indicates that the ﬂux cancellation rate was almost the same during and after the ﬂux emergence
phase.

To understand the high eruptivity of the AR 11429, we analyzed certain non-potential parameters: viz, non-
neutralized current, length of sheared PIL, helicity (dH/dt), and energy injection (dE/dt) rate (for computational
details of these parameters see, Vemareddy 2015; Vasantharaju et al. 2018; Vemareddy 2019a). The upper panel of
Figure 6 shows the non-neutralized currents in positive (negative) polarity in blue (red). A strong non-neutralized
current was observed in the AR 11429 throughout the observational period. Also, long sheared PILs were observed
throughout the evolution of the AR (shown in grey in the upper panel of Figure 6). The stress in the ﬁeld lines due to
plasma ﬂows generates non-neutralized current in an AR (e.g., T¨or¨ok et al. 2014; Vemareddy et al. 2015; Vemareddy
2017b). A higher level of deviation (> 1.5) from the current neutrality condition and long sheared PILs suggests that
the AR was very CME productive (e.g., Liu et al. 2017; Vemareddy 2019b). There was a signiﬁcant decrease in the
length of sheared PIL after March 9, and maybe that was the reason for the decrease in the ﬂare activity after it.
Further, continuous shearing and converging motions of opposite magnetic ﬂuxes were injecting and storing magnetic
helicity and magnetic energy in the solar corona (see the middle and lower panels of Figure 6). The rate of helicity
and energy injection was almost constant after March 7. The initial high helicity and energy rates were due to major
magnetic ﬂux emergence during the early evolutionary phase of the AR. Continuous shearing and converging motion
of the opposite magnetic ﬂuxes were continuously injecting magnetic helicity and energy in the AR 11429 and were
responsible for recurrent solar eruptions. The homologous eruptions can be understood as a cycle of storage and release
of magnetic helicity and energy from the AR (Vemareddy 2017a).

4.2. Pre-eruptive Structures in the Corona

While strongly inﬂuenced by magnetic evolution in the photosphere, solar eruptions occur in the corona. Therefore,
coronal magnetic structures and their evolution are one of the most important aspects of solar eruptions. One way to
analyze them is through the observation of plasma-emission at diﬀerent electromagnetic wavelengths. Another way to
know about the coronal magnetic ﬁeld is through the extrapolation of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data. However it
is not possible to get the exact 3-D magnetic ﬁeld in the corona through 2-D magnetic ﬂux observations. Therefore
observational validation is necessary for the analysis of such results. Here, we used both techniques to complement
each other and to have a proper understanding of pre-eruptive coronal structures and environment. To reconstruct
the coronal magnetic structure, we carried out NLFFF extrapolation (Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010) at every hour
from 2012 March 6, 00:10 UT to 2012 March 10, 19:34 UT. Cutouts of HMI vector magnetograms were taken as the
bottom boundary of the computational domain. These were inserted in an extended ﬁeld of view to weaken the eﬀects
of lateral boundaries and were pre-processed to make them suitable for the force-free conditions (Wiegelmann et al.
2006). Computations were performed on a uniformly spaced grid of 276 × 148 × 196 pixels corresponding to a physical
volume of 199 × 106 × 141 Mm3 (more details in Dhakal et al. 2018).

A ﬁlament was observed to lie along the SW-PIL (see Figure 7), indicating sheared and/or twisted ﬁeld lines (e.g.,
Priest et al. 1989). Following the eruptions on March 7 and 9, the ﬁlament was observed to still exist along the SW-PIL
under the fading post-ﬂare arcade in AIA cool passbands (e.g., 304 ˚A). The appearance of the ﬁlament, immediately
after the eruption, suggests that either only part of it erupted or it did not erupt at all, thus indicating the partial
eruption of the magnetic structure (e.g., Tang 1986; Gilbert et al. 2000; Gibson et al. 2002).

On March 6 at 23:35 UT, ∼ one hour prior to the ﬁrst solar eruption, we observed a coherent hot-channel structure
(HCS) to lie along the SW-PIL (see Figure 8(a)). Hot channels are so named as they are observed in hot passbands
of the AIA i.e., 94 ˚A (6 MK) and 131 ˚A (10 MK) (e.g., Zhang et al. 2012). The temperature map, obtained through
diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) method (e.g., Cheng et al. 2012), indicated that it was hotter than 7 MK. It was
also observed as sigmoid in X-ray images (see Figure 8(c)). These are called sigmoid because of their forward-S or
reverse-S shape (e.g., Rust & Kumar 1996). Both the HCS and X-ray sigmoids are considered as the observational
proxy of MFR (e.g., Green et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2012). NLFFF extrapolation results showed that long, sheared
and twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines were lying along the SW-PIL (see the top panels of Figure 9). Both observational and
extrapolation results suggest the existence of an MFR in the SW sub-region of the AR. As discussed in section 3, the
HCS was observed to erupt on March 7 around 01:05 UT. A coronal structure was seen to reform by March 9 01:30
UT, in the SW sub-region over the period of two days. Its morphology in EUV and X-ray images was similar to the
coronal structure observed on March 6 (see the middle panels of Figure 8). Ensuing the eruption on March 9 03:00

UT, another coronal structure of identical morphology (see the lower panels of Figure 8) was observed to reform in the
period of one and half days. The extrapolation results showed that the coronal structure (on both days) was sheared
and twisted like the observed structure on March 6 (see Figure 9). This suggests that MFR of identical shape was
reformed before each homologous eruption.

A persistent convergence and ﬂux cancellation were observed in the SW sub-region. Also, there was a continuous
shearing motion between the opposite magnetic ﬂuxes. Shearing motion and ﬂux cancellation are well known to

generate long and twisted ﬁeld lines along the PILs (e.g., van Ballegooijen & Martens 1989). This suggests that the
shearing motion and ﬂux cancellation were responsible for the recurrent formation of MFR along the SW-PIL.

4.3. Initiation of the eruption

A conﬁned ﬂare was observed on the left side of the SW sub-region during the PP of each eruption. It was observed
as a small bump in the SXR intensity proﬁle, a brightening of HCS, and the appearance of ﬂare ribbons (see Figure
10 for the ﬂare ribbons). The SXR peak of the PP for the ﬁrst eruption was not observed due to the contamination
from another nearby event (as discussed in 3; see Figure 1), nevertheless other signatures were observed. Identical PP
could suggest that the triggering mechanisms were the same for the three solar eruptions (e.g., Vemareddy 2017a).
The conﬁned ﬂare was observed near the small chunk of positive magnetic ﬂux (positive-chunk), which was almost
surrounded by the negative magnetic ﬂux (shown by a red arrow in Figure 11 (a)). Using NLFFF extrapolation results
and codes developed by R. Liu and J. Chen (See Liu et al. 2016), we calculated the squashing factor Q in the AR
11429. The contours of high-Q are considered as the proxy of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; Titov et al. 2002). Flare
ribbons appeared around the positive-chunk, therefore we analyzed the magnetic topology around it. The vertical-slice
of Q-map in the middle of it revealed the presence of semicircular QSLs (see Figure 11), extending from one end to the
other end of it. The previous study by Polito et al. (2017) of the AR 11429, on March 9, had found 3D dome-shaped
QSLs surrounding the positive-chunk. Here, the vertical slice of dome-shaped QSLs is seen as semicircular QSLs. The
semicircular shape of QSLs was maintained before each eruption, though its size changed over the period. QSLs are
the probable sites of magnetic reconnection (Demoulin et al. 1996, 1997). The whole positive-chunk was very dynamic
throughout the evolution of the AR. Also, new ﬂux emergence was observed there before March 9. Therefore, the
shearing motion or ﬂux emergence could have triggered the magnetic reconnection there.

The MFR, along SW-PIL, was situated between two big magnetic poles and thus a strong overlying magnetic
strapping force can be inferred above it. Strong overlying ﬁelds can inhibit successful eruption from ARs (e.g.,
Sun et al. 2015). The rate at which the strength of overlying magnetic ﬁelds decreases with height can be analyzed
using the decay-index (n). An MFR becomes torus-unstable if n is greater or equal to the critical value (ncrit = 1.5;
Bateman 1978; Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006). Using NLFFF results we calculated the decay-index at diﬀerent height as,

Figure 7. Filament of identical shape, in Hα images from BBSO, were present persistently during the evolution of the AR
11429. White arrow in (a) points to the ﬁlament in southwest sub-region of the AR.

Here, Bh is the horizontal component of the magnetic ﬁeld, and z is the radial distance from the solar surface. Figure 12
shows the distribution of super-critical decay-index (n ≥ 1.5) at diﬀerent heights before each eruptions. The closed
contours represent the area where horizontal magnetic ﬁelds are very weak. An erupting MFR would preferably pass
through such contours (e.g., Chintzoglou et al. 2015). In the SW sub-region, the contours changed and moved more
toward the positive polarity with evolution. This could be the reason for the observed change in the direction of
successive CMEs, as discussed in section 3. Also, it is clear from the decay-index maps that it would have been hard
for low-lying MFR to become torus-unstable and erupt from the SW-PIL. Therefore, it is most probable that the PP
ﬂare facilitated the eruption of underlying MFR by weakening the constraint of overlying magnetic ﬁeld.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Our primary goal of the present study is to understand the recurrent homologous solar eruptions from the AR 11429.
There were three homologous eruptions from the southwest (SW) sub-region within 87 hours. The ﬁrst eruption was
associated with X-class ﬂare and the other two eruptions were associated with M-class ﬂares. Nevertheless, the shape
of X-ray proﬁles of the three ﬂares was very similar. The same photospheric location, similar evolution and location
of ﬂare ribbons, EUV dimmings, and identical coronographic morphology of the CME invoked them as homologous
eruptions.

Our main result of the study is that the continuous ﬂux cancellation due to shearing motions and the convergence of
opposite magnetic bipoles along the PILs was the primary factor for the homologous solar eruptions. Flux emergence
was observed only in the initial evolutionary period of the AR, ﬂux cancellation was observed throughout the evolution
that span all three events, including prior to the ﬁrst event. While ﬂux emergence was important and relevant in AR
11429, our study suggests that long-term ﬂux cancellation and shearing motions were the most probable mechanisms
that produced homologous eruptions. The photospheric motions of magnetic ﬂux injected magnetic helicity and
magnetic energy in the corona gradually. Stored helicity and energy released intermittently during solar eruptions.
We believe that due to continuous shearing and converging motions of the magnetic ﬂux, there was a cycle of storage
and release of magnetic helicity and magnetic energy from the AR. In general, opposite magnetic poles of an emerging
bipoles (conjugate pair) move away from each other, the separation distance depends on the ﬂux content of the emerged
bipoles (Wang & Sheeley 1989). In the present case, we did not observe the separation between opposite poles in SW
sub-region, instead they were converging towards each other throughout the observational period. Therefore, we
believe that these were non-conjugate pair. It was accompanied by the persistent shearing motion and magnetic ﬂux
cancellation. Chintzoglou et al. (2019) suggests that the convergence of opposite magnetic poles of non-conjugated pair
leads to the magnetic ﬂux cancellation and shearing motions, which could produce solar eruptions.

phase activity, as observed in AIA 1600 ˚A, are overplotted on the HMI LOS-magnetogram in blue. The red contours in (a)
show the ﬂare ribbons from an earlier eruption. The orange asterisks indicate the outline of the hot-channel structure observed
in AIA 131 ˚A.

A ﬁlament was lying along the SW-PIL throughout the observational period and was observed soon after the
eruptions. A ﬁlament survives and would be visible after a partial eruption. Partial eruption could happen either by
the splitting of a single ﬂux rope during the eruption(e.g., Gibson & Fan 2006; Zhang et al. 2015) or by the eruption
of upper part of double-decker system (e.g., Liu et al. 2012; Kliem et al. 2014). Though a double-decker system was
observed along the SW-PIL before the eruption on March 10 (see Dhakal et al. 2018), it is hard to say whether a single
ﬂux rope split or a double-decker system was present before the eruption on March 7 and March 9. Nevertheless, we
believe that there was a partial eruption of the magnetic system from the SW-PIL.

A magnetic structure was formed along the SW-PIL before each eruption. It was observed as a coherent hot-channel
structure in AIA EUV and sigmoid in X-ray images. Reforming HCS/sigmoid was almost identical in appearance.
HCS and sigmoid are considered as an observational proxy of magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR). Long, sheared and twisted
magnetic ﬁeld lines along the SW-PIL were found in our extrapolation results. Therefore, we believe that an MFR
was formed and existed before each eruption. Chatterjee & Fan 2013 studied the emergence of twisted ﬂux rope
in magnetohydrodynamic simulation. They suggest that the partial eruption and reformation of MFR can produce
homologous eruptions. In their simulation, reformed MFR was appeared as X-ray sigmoid. In the present case, ﬂux

emergence was going on before the ﬁrst eruption. It is possible that the erupting MFR, before the ﬁrst eruption, could
have emerged from the sub-photosphere. However, since there were continuous shearing motion and ﬂux cancellation
in the SW sub-region, spanning the three eruptions. Also, after partial eruption an erupting magnetic structure of
similar morphology was reformed. Therefore we believe that, most probably the shearing motion and ﬂux cancellation
were the primary mechanisms that formed the erupting MFR along the SW-PIL.

At last, we want to discuss about the identical precursor phase (PP) activity in the AR. It was identiﬁed as a conﬁned
ﬂare surrounding an island of positive ﬂux at the left side of the SW sub-region. A complex magnetic conﬁguration,
semicircular quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), was inferred to exist in the region. The magnetic conﬁguration was almost
the same before each eruption, we believe this was due to the reformation of identical magnetic structures in the region.
It is arguable that the identical PP was due to reconnection at identically shaped QSLs, either due to ﬂux emergence
or shifting of the island itself. As a strong overlying magnetic strapping force, due to overlying magnetic ﬁeld, was
inferred above the MFR lying along the SW-PIL. Our study suggests that the PP ﬂare facilitated the eruption by
removing the overlying magnetic strapping force above the MFR.
