An extension of the Standard Model with Majorana singlet fermions in the 1-100 GeV range can
explain the light neutrino masses and give rise to a baryon asymmetry at freeze-in of the heavy
states, via their CP-violating oscillations. In this paper we consider extending this scenario to also
explain dark matter. We ﬁnd that a very weakly coupled B − L gauge boson, an invisible QCD
axion model, and the singlet majoron model can simultaneously account for dark matter and the
baryon asymmetry.

INTRODUCTION

scenario can be found in [42, 43]

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics needs to
be extended to explain neutrino masses, the missing grav-
itating matter (DM) and the observed matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the universe.

Some of the most minimal extensions of the SM include
new fermions, namely two or three sterile Majorana neu-
trinos (singlets under the full gauge group), which can
account for the tiny neutrino masses, through the see-
saw mechanism [1–4], and explain the observed matter-
antimatter asymmetry through leptogenesis [5]. The
simplest version of leptogenesis establishes the source
of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the CP violat-
ing the out-of-equilibrium decay of the heavy neutrinos.
This scenario requires however relatively large Majorana
masses > 108 GeV [6] (or ∼ 106 GeV with ﬂavour eﬀects
[7] included), which makes these models diﬃcult to test
experimentally. For Majorana neutrinos in the 1-100 GeV
range, it has been shown by Akhmedov, Rubakov and
Smirnov (ARS) [8] and reﬁned by Asaka and Shaposh-
nikov (AS) [9] that a diﬀerent mechanism of leptogenesis
In this case the asymmetries are produced
is at work.
at freeze-in of the sterile states via their CP-violating
oscillations. The original ARS proposal did not include
ﬂavour eﬀects and needs at least three Majorana species,
while AS have shown that ﬂavour eﬀects can make it
work with just two species. In the rest of the paper we
will refer indistinctively to both scenarios as baryogenesis
from oscillations (BO). In both cases, the lepton asym-
metry is reprocessed into a baryonic one by electroweak
sphalerons [10]. The extra heavy neutrinos in this case
could be produced and searched for in beam dump ex-
periments and colliders (see [11–23] for an incomplete list
of works), possibly giving rise to spectacular signals such
as displaced vertices [15, 16, 18, 20, 21]. Since only two
sterile neutrinos are needed to generate the baryon asym-
metry [9, 24–39], the lightest sterile neutrino in the keV
range can be very weakly coupled and play the role of DM
[40]. This is the famous νMSM [9]. However the strin-
gent X-ray bounds imply that this scenario can only work
in the presence of a leptonic asymmetry [41] signiﬁcantly
larger than the baryonic one, which is quite diﬃcult to
achieve. A recent update of astrophysical bounds on this

In this paper our main goal is to consider scenarios
compatible with Majorana masses in the 1-100 GeV range
and study the conditions under which the models can
explain DM without spoiling ARS leptogenesis [121]. In
particular, we will focus on models that are minimal ex-
tensions of the type I seesaw model with three singlet
neutrinos. We will ﬁrst consider an extension involv-
ing a gauged B − L model [44], which includes an extra
gauge boson and can explain DM in the form of a non-
thermal keV neutrino. We will then consider an exten-
sion which includes a CP axion [45] that can solve the
strong CP problem and explain DM in the form of cold
axions. Finally we consider the majoron singlet model
[46, 47] which can also explain DM under certain condi-
tions both in the form of a heavy majorana neutrino or
a majoron.

The plan of the paper is as follows. We start by brieﬂy
reviewing the ARS mechanism and the essential ingredi-
ents and conditions that need to be met when the sterile
neutrinos have new interactions. In section III we discuss
the gauged B − L model, in section IV, we study the in-
visible axion model with sterile neutrinos and in section
V we reconsider the singlet majoron model. In section
VI we conclude.

II. LEPTOGENESIS FROM OSCILLATIONS

For a recent extensive review of the ARS mechanism
see [48]. The model is just the type I seesaw model with
three neutrino singlets, Ni, i = 1 − 3, which interact
with the SM only through their Yukawa couplings. The
Lagrangian in the Majorana mass basis is

(1)
In the early Universe before the electroweak (EW) phase
transition, the singlet neutrinos are produced through
their Yukawa couplings in ﬂavour states, which are lin-
ear combinations of the mass eigenstates. Singlet neu-
trinos then oscillate, and since CP is not conserved, lep-
ton number L gets unevenly distributed between diﬀerent
ﬂavours. At high enough temperatures T (cid:29) mNi, total

 
 
 
 
 
 
lepton number vanishes, in spite of which a surplus of
baryons over antibaryons can be produced, because the
ﬂavoured lepton asymmetries are stored in the diﬀerent
species and transferred at diﬀerent rates to the baryons.
As long as full equilibration of the sterile states is not
reached before the EW phase transition (TEW ∼ 140GeV)
, when sphaleron processes freeze-out, a net baryon asym-
metry survives.
It is essential that at least one of the
sterile neutrinos does not equilibrate by tEW. The rate
of interactions of these neutrinos at temperatures much
higher than their mass can be estimated to be

Γα ∝ κy2

αT,

(2)

where yα are the eigenvalues of the neutrino Yukawa ma-
trix, T is the temperature and κ = few 10−3 [49–51]. The
Hubble expansion rate in the radiation dominated era is

(3)

where g∗ is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom
(g∗ ∼ 100 above the EW phase transition). The require-
ment that no equilibration is reached before tEW is:

Γα(TEW) ≤ H(TEW),

which implies yukawa couplings of order

yα (cid:46) 10−7,

(4)

(5)

i.e. not much smaller than the electron yukawa. These
yukawa couplings are compatible with the light neutrino
masses for Majorana masses in the 1 GeV-100 GeV range.
Any model that extends the one described above with
new ﬁelds/interactions should be such that the new in-
teractions do not increase the equilibration rate of the
sterile neutrinos for the out-of-equilibrium requirement
in the ARS mechanism to be met. We will now consider
the implications of this requirement on various extensions
of the minimal seesaw model of eq. (1) that are well mo-
tivated by trying to explain also the dark matter and in
one case also the strong CP problem.

III. B-L GAUGE SYMMETRY

The SM is invariant under an accidental global
U (1)B−L symmetry, that couples to baryon minus lep-
ton number. If one promotes this symmetry to a local
one [44], the model needs to be extended with three addi-
tional right handed neutrinos to avoid anomalies, which
interestingly makes the type I seesaw model the minimal
particle content compatible with this gauge symmetry.
In this case, we have interactions between SM lepton and
quark ﬁelds with the new gauge boson, Vµ, as well as an
additional term involving sterile neutrinos

sensitivity of bremsstrahlung searches in SHIP [65, 66]. The
solid, dotted and dashed black lines correspond to the correct
DM relic abundance in the form of sterile neutrinos of mass
1, 10 and 100 keV respectively. The dotted red line indicates
the lower limit on the gauge coupling for which V is in ther-
mal equilibrium. The solid red lines correspond to the upper

A massive higgs from the B − L breaking, σ, remains
in the spectrum with a mass that we can assume to be
Mσ ∼ (cid:104)φ(cid:105).

Existing constraints on this model come from direct
searches for V in elastic neutrino-electron scattering, V
gauge boson production at colliders, Drell-Yan processes
and new ﬂavour changing meson decays [52–59]. The
status of these searches is summarized in Fig. 1, adapted
from [60] (see also [61–63]). For masses, 1 GeV ≤ mV ≤
10 GeV, gB−L is bounded to be smaller than ∼ 10−4,
while the limit is weaker for larger masses. The improved
prospects to search for right-handed neutrinos exploiting
the U (1)B−L interaction have been recently studied in
[60], where the authors consider the displaced decay of
the N at the LHC and the proposed SHIP beam dump
experiment[64].

For mV ≤ 1GeV the strongest constraints come
from supernova cooling [67, 70–72], beam dump searches

The sum is over all the standard model fermions whose
thermal mass is such that mV (T ) ≥ 2mf (T ). The lower
limit on gB−L for the thermalization of the B − L boson
is shown as a dotted red line in Fig.1. Provided the B −L
boson is in thermal equilibrium we have to consider its
interactions with the sterile neutrinos driving leptogen-
esis. Assuming that the V boson is lighter than 2mN ,
so that the decay V → N N is kinematically forbidden,
the dominant contribution [81] comes from the scattering
processes with the fermions and gauge bosons in Fig.3.
To ensure these processes do not equilibrate the sterile
neutrinos, we should have

In the next section we will include these new interac-
tions in the equations for the generation of the baryon
asymmetry, and our results conﬁrm the naive estimate
in eq. (13).

Finally we consider

the production of neutrinos
through the decay of σ → N N , which is relevant for
T ≥ Mσ, since Mσ (cid:29) mN . The requirement that this
process does not thermalize the sterile neutrinos implies
that the decay rate, Γσ, is slower than the Hubble rate
at T ≥ Mσ:

FIG. 2: Shaded regions are presently excluded by super-
nova observations [67], BBN bounds estimated in [68] and
the combined beam dump experiments from [69]. Unshaded
regions represent the reach of SHIP from meson decay and
bremsstrahlung searches [65]. The curves indicate the val-
ues of (gB−L, mV ) where the lightest sterile neutrino N1 can
account for the whole dark matter for three values of the neu-
trino masses, mN = 1, 10, 100 keV in solid, dotted and dashed
lines.

[69, 73–77] and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)
[68, 69, 78–80]. Recent updates on these bounds are com-
piled in Fig. 2. The lower mass region labeled BBN is ex-
cluded by the eﬀect of ∆Neﬀ on the expansion, while the
higher mass BBN region is excluded because the injection
of electromagnetic energy from the V decay to charged
particles during nucleosynthesis distorts the abundance
of light elements. These BBN constraints have been eval-
uated in detail in ref. [78, 79]. In the relevant region of
parameter space, they are seen to depend on the lifetime
of the decaying particle and its abundance per baryon
prior to decay. The corresponding region in Fig. 2 is
a sketch of the excluded region in the latter analysis,
which is approximately bounded by the lines correspond-
ing to the lifetimes τV ∈ [0.1 − 100]s, the threshold for V
hadronic decays, mV ≥ 2mπ, and the line corresponding
to the fraction of the V decaying to charged particles per
baryon, nem

V /nb = 1.

At least two of the neutrinos will be involved in the BO
mechanism and their masses must be in the 1-100 GeV
range. We need to ensure that the new B −L interactions
do not bring them to thermal equilibrium before tEW ,
which will set an upper bound on gB−L. It it important
to know however if the B − L gauge boson is in thermal
equilibrium which also depends on gB−L. For mV (cid:46)
65 GeV, the dominant process is the scattering tt ↔ V H

On the other hand, for mV ≥ 2mN the dominant pro-
duction goes via the decay of the gauge boson into two
sterile neutrinos V → N N , which, if kinematically al-

One may worry if thermal mass corrections can al-

tions to the masses of the form

m(T ) ∼ gB−LT.

(18)

The thermal mass of the gauge boson is larger than that
of the sterile neutrino, because all fermions charged under
B − L will contribute to the former and only the gauge

We substitute the temperature dependent mass in
eq. (16) and we show in Fig. 4 the ratio Γ(V → N N )/H
close to the minimum threshold temperature (where
mT

of gB−L. The upper limit for gB−L are less stringent
than those derived from 2 → 2 processes in eq. (13).We
now evaluate in detail the eﬀect on BO induced by the
new scatterings of Fig. 3. Leptogenesis in the presence of
a new B − L gauge interaction has been recently studied
in [81], although not in the context of BO, which as far
as we know has not been considered before.

A. Leptogenesis

The sterile neutrinos relevant for leptogenesis are the
heavier ones, mN2,3, with masses in the 1-100 GeV, and
we focus on the scenario where mV ≤ 2mN2,3. We now
explain how to include the terms involving the B − L
gauge interactions in the quantum kinetic equations for
BO leptogenesis as derived in [31]. Following Raﬀelt-Sigl
approach [83], we consider a density matrix, ρ(k), de-
scribing the expectation value of number densities of N
and a density matrix describing the corresponding anti-
particles, ¯ρ(k)[123]. These equations are complemented
with three equations involving the slow varying chemi-
cal potentials, µB/3−Lα. The modiﬁcation of the kinetic
equations induced by the B − L interactions is the addi-
tion of new collision terms in the equations for ρ and ¯ρ,
that have the same ﬂavour structure as the neutral cur-
rent contribution considered in [83]. As explained above
the most relevant contributions come from the scattering
processes: ¯f f ↔ N ¯N and V V ↔ N ¯N . The latter is
enhanced at high temperatures, but of course will only
be relevant if the V (cid:48)s are in thermal equilibrium, which
we assume in the following.

The additional collision terms, from the ﬁrst process,
in the equation for the evolution ρ(k) can be writen in
the form:

As usual we are interested in the evolution in an ex-
panding universe, where the density matrices depend on
momentum, y ≡ p/T and the scale factor or inverse tem-
perature x ∝ T −1. We consider the averaged momen-
tum approximation, which assumes that all the momen-
tum dependence factorizes in the Fermi-Dirac distribu-
tion and the density r is just a function of the scale fac-
tor, ie. ρ(x, y) = fF (y)r(x). In this approximation we
can do the integration over momentum and the B − L

Mσ. For higher temperature, T ≥ Tmax, the contribution
of the physical scalar σ has to be included, leading to a
rate ∝ T . The new interactions do not modify the chemi-
cal potential dependent terms, nor the evolution equation
for µB/3−Lα . The equations are therefore those in [31]
with the additional B − L terms in eq. (23).

To illustrate the eﬀect of the B − L gauge interac-
tion, we have considered the test point of ref. [31] with
masses for the heavy steriles mN2,3 ∼ 0.8 GeV. Within
the parameter space of successful leptogenesis, this point
was chosen because it leads to charmed meson decays to
heavy sterile neutrinos that could be observable in SHIP,
and furthermore this measurement, in combination with
input from neutrinoless double beta decay and CP vi-
olation in neutrino oscillations, could provide a quanti-
tative prediction of the baryon asymmetry. Adding the
B − L terms to the equations for r and ¯r of [31], and
solving them numerically (for details on the method see
[31]) we obtain the curves in Fig. 5. The rates depend
on mV so we choose mV = 1GeV. The evolution of the
baryon asymmetry as a function of TEW/T is shown by
the solid line of Fig. 5 in the absence of B − L interac-
tions or for a suﬃciently small value of gB−L. The sup-
pression of the asymmetry is visible for larger values of
gB−L (cid:38) few × 10−5 as shown by the dashed and dashed-
dotted lines. The naive expectations in Fig. 1 is therefore
conﬁrmed and we do not expect a signiﬁcant modiﬁca-
tion of the baryon asymmetry of the minimal model, as
long as gB−L satisﬁes the bound in eq. (13).

B. Dark Matter

Now we want to discuss possible dark matter candi-
dates in the B − L scenario without spoiling the BO
mechanism, which as we have seen imposes a stringent

upper bound on the gauge coupling, gB−L. We will be in-
terested in the region where the V boson can decay to the
lightest neutrino, ie mV ≥ 2mN1. The small value needed
for gB−L suggests to consider the possibility of a freeze-in
scenario [84, 85], where the gauge boson does not reach
thermalization, and neither does the lightest sterile neu-
trino, N1. The status of dark matter in a higher mass
range through freeze-out has been recently updated in
[63].

As it is well known, N1 in the keV mass range is suf-
ﬁciently long lived to provide a viable warm DM can-
didate [40, 41]. The B − L model is as we will see a
simple extension of the νMSM [9], which avoids the need
of huge lepton asymmetries to evade X-ray bounds. In
our scenario the keV state is produced from the decay
V → N1N1, while the lifetime of N1, relevant in X-ray
bounds, is controlled also by mixing, which can be suf-
ﬁciently small, in a technically natural way, as in the
νMSM scenario (provided the lightest neutrino mass is
small enough). A similar scenario for DM has been stud-
ied in [66]. We now quantify the parameter space for
successful DM and leptogenesis in this scenario.

We assume that the abundance of V and N1 is zero
at a temperature below the EW phase transition where
all the remaining particles in the model are in thermal
equilibrium. All fermions in the model couple to the V
and therefore its production is dominated by the inverse
decay process: f f → V . The kinetic equation describing
the production of V is the following:

C. Couplings

According to the previous calculation, the relic DM
abundance requires a very small B −L coupling. In order
to obtain, for example, a mass mV ∼ 1 MeV, the gauge
coupling needed to generate DM is

gB−L ∼ 10−11.8,

(cid:104)φ(cid:105) ∼ 2 · 108 GeV.

It is straightforward to solve these equations. In Fig. 6

lution of ΩN1h2 is shown in Fig.7 for two values of mV
and a ﬁxed value of gB−L. Requiring that ΩN1h2 equals
the full DM contribution of ΩDM h2 (cid:39) 0.12 implies a re-
lation between mV and gB−L as shown in the curves of
Fig. 2.The values of gB−L corresponding to the right dark
matter relic abundance do not aﬀect leptogenesis and lie
far below the actual collider limits. Nevertheless some
regions of the parameter space are interestingly excluded
from supernova and BBN observations.

A ﬁnal comment concerns the comparison of our calcu-
lation of the DM abundance and that in ref. [66]. In this
reference only the evolution of the N1 is considered, and
the collision term corresponds to the scattering process
f ¯f → N1N1, where the narrow width approximation is
assumed. We believe this method is only equivalent to
ours when all f, ¯f and V distributions are the equilib-
rium ones, but this is not the case here. In the region
they can be compared our results are roughly a factor
three smaller than those in [66].

In order to get the N1 and N2,3 in the target range of
keV and 1-100 GeV respectively, small and hierarchical
hNi couplings are needed:

hN2 (cid:39) hN3 ∼ 10−6 − 10−8,

(41)

for the heavy sterile neutrinos involved in BO leptogene-
sis and

hN1 ∼ 10−12,

(42)

for the dark matter candidate. Note that the required
hN ’s couplings are in the same ballpark as the yukawa
couplings. The gauged B − L model works nicely to ex-
plain neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry and dark
matter. Unfortunately it also requires a very small gB−L
which will be very hard to test experimentally. An alter-
native might be to consider a ﬂavoured U (1), for example
Lµ − Lτ , that might be compatible with a larger gB−L,
provided the assignment of charges to the singlet states
ensures that not all of them reach thermalization via the
ﬂavoured gauge interaction before tEW .

IV. AXION AND NEUTRINOS

where z = mu/md. For fa ≥ 4 · 108 GeV, we have

As a second example we consider an extension of eq. (1)
with a scalar doublet and a scalar singlet. This model is
also an extension of the invisible axion model [86] with
sterile neutrinos, that was ﬁrst considered in [45], provid-
ing a connection between the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symme-
try breaking scale and the seesaw scale of the neutrino
masses. The model contains two scalar doublets, Φi, and
one singlet, φ. A U (1)P Q global symmetry exists if the
two Higgs doublets couple separately to the up and down
quarks and leptons so that the Yukawa Lagrangian takes
the form:

L ⊃ −YuQLΦ1uR − YdQLΦ2dR − Y LLΦ1N

−YlLLΦ2lR −

(43)

leading naturally to type II two-Higgs-doublet models
without FCNC [87, 88].

The most general scalar potential of the model com-

patible with a global U (1)P Q is the following

The couplings in this potential can be chosen such that
φ gets an expectation value,

U (1)P Q is then spontaneously broken and a Nambu-
Goldstone boson appears, the QCD axion. Furthermore
the Majorana singlets N get a mass. Expanding around
the right vacuum, the ﬁeld can be writen as

φ =

1
√
2

(fa + σ + ia),

(46)

where σ is a massive ﬁeld, while a is the axion. Therefore
after symmetry breaking we obtain an interaction term
between sterile neutrinos and axions

L ⊃ −

ihN
2

aN cN + h.c.

(47)

The breaking scale fa must be much larger than the vac-
uum expectation values of the doublets, (cid:29) v1,2, so that
the axion can evade the stringent bounds from rare me-
son decays and supernova cooling, which sets a stringent
lower bound fa ≥ 4 · 108GeV [89].

The mass of the axion is induced by the QCD anomaly

(49)

ma ≤ O (cid:0)10−2(cid:1) eV.

It is well known that the invisible axion is a viable cold
DM candidate, through the misalignment mechanism [86,
90, 91] (for recent reviews see [92, 93]). The DM energy
density is given by

Ωah2 ∼ 2 · 104

(cid:18)

fa
1016GeV

(cid:104)θ0(cid:105)2,

(50)

where θ0 is the misalignment angle. The constraints on
fa depend on whether the breaking of the PQ symmetry
happens before or after inﬂation; in the latter case the
misalignment angle can be averaged over many patches

(cid:104)θ0(cid:105)2 ∼

π2
3

,

so Ωa ≤ ΩDM implies

fa (cid:46) 1.2 · 1011GeV,

(51)

(52)

with the equality reproducing the observed cold dark
matter energy density ΩCDMh2 ∼ 0.12. This correspond
to the solid line in Fig. 8. If the PQ symmetry is broken
before inﬂation, θ0 is a free parameter and the value of
fa to account for DM is inversely proportional to θ2
0.

The axion can also manifest itself as dark radiation
[94], given that it is also thermally produced [95]. This
population of hot axions contributes to the eﬀective num-
ber of relativistic species, but the size of this contribution
is currently well within the observational bounds [96].

In this model the VEV of the scalar singlet gives a

mN ≈ hN fa.

(53)

So, if we want a mass in the electroweak range, O(1−102)
GeV and fa ∈ [108, 1011] GeV, we need the coupling hN
to be in the range:

hN ∈ [10−11, 10−6].

(54)

The hierarchy between fa and the electroweak scale re-
quires that some couplings in the scalar potential
in
eq. (44) (k, λ1φ, λ2φ) are very small. Even if not very
appealing theoretically, these small numbers are techni-
cally natural as already pointed out in [97], where the
authors studied the same model with very heavy sterile
neutrinos.
A relevant question is that of naturalness or ﬁne-tunning
of the Higgs mass in this model. In [97], this issue was
studied in the context of high-scale thermal leptogene-
sis, and it was concluded that stability imposes relevant

mN = 105 − 106GeV so that yukawa’s are small enough,
y ≤ 10−4, and do not induce unnaturally large correc-
tions to the Higgs mass. In our case, the yukawa cou-
plings, eq.(5), are too small to give large corrections to

(for mN ∈ [1, 102] GeV), safely within the targeted range.
Fig.8 shows the region on the (fa, hN ) plane for which
successful baryogenesis through the BO mechanism and
DM can work in this model.

Even if the necessary condition for BO leptogenesis is
met for fa ≥ 108 GeV, the presence of the extra degrees of
freedom, the axion, the heavy scalar and the second dou-
blet could modify quantitatively the baryon asymmetry.
For example, the presence of two scalar doublets could
modify the scattering rates of the sterile neutrinos con-
sidered in the BO scenario, where the main contributions
[35, 49, 51, 102] are:

• 2 ↔ 2 scatterings on top quarks via higgs exchange

• 2 ↔ 2 scatterings on gauge bosons

• 1 ↔ 2 decays or inverse decays including resumed

soft-gauge interactions

Sterile neutrinos are coupled to the same Higgs doublet
that also couples to the top quarks; in this case noth-
ing changes with respect to the usual calculation,
in
which the reactions with top quarks are mediated by Φ1.
However, an alternative model, with a diﬀerent U (1)P Q
charge assignment, is also possible, in which the sterile
neutrinos couple to φ2 and not φ1, as done in [97]. In this
case top quark scattering does not contribute to sterile
neutrino production at tree level, but the baryon asym-
metry is not expected to change signiﬁcantly, since the
scattering rate on gauge bosons and the 1 → 2 processes
are equally important [49, 51].
The process σ → N N is not foreseen to be relevant for
Mσ ∼ fa, since the scalar is long decoupled when the
generation of the asymmetry starts, while the new pro-
cess N N ↔ aa is expected to be very small according to
the above estimates. It could nevertheless be interesting
to look for possible corners of parameter space where the
diﬀerences with respect to the minimal model is not neg-
ligible since this could provide a testing ground for the
axion sector of the model.

V. MAJORON MODEL

In between the two models described in III - IV, there
is the possibility of having a global U (1) spontaneously
broken, which is not related to the strong CP problem
and we call it lepton number. This is of course the well-
known singlet majoron model [46, 47, 103]. We assume
the sterile neutrinos carry lepton number, LN = 1, but

FIG. 8: The light purple region is forbidden by supernova
cooling constraints (left band) and the red one by axions over
closing the universe (right band). Axions can explain the DM
relic density in the vertical line, if inﬂation happens before PQ
symmetry breaking. Within the remaining parameter space,
in the region between the two dashed lines successful leptoge-
nesis via oscillations is possible.

the Higgs mass , so no additional constraint needs to be
imposed on v2. As a consequence other invisible axion
models, such as the KSVZ [98, 99], would also work in
the context of low-scale mN , but leads to tension with
stability bounds in the high-scale version [100, 101].

A. Baryon Asymmetry

The possibility to generate the baryon asymmetry in
this model a la Fukugita-Yanagida for very heavy neutri-
nos mN ∼ fa was recognized in the original proposal [45]
and further elaborated in [97]. We want to point out here
that for much smaller values of hN , the BO mechanism
could also work successfully.
As explained above the crucial point is whether the new
interactions of the sterile states in this model are fast
enough to equilibrate all the sterile neutrinos before EW
phase transition. The leading order process we have to
consider is the decay of the scalar into two sterile neutri-
nos σ → N N , exactly as we considered in the previous
section. The limit of Mσ ∼ fa ≥ 2×105 −5×106 GeV de-
rived in eq. (15) also applies here, which is safely satisﬁed
given the supernova cooling bounds.

At second order, we must also consider the new anni-
hilation process of sterile neutrinos to axions N N ↔ aa
as shown in Fig. 9. The rate of this process at high tem-
peratures, T (cid:29) mN , is given by

ΓNa =

(55)

The condition ΓNa (T ) < H(T ) is satisﬁed for T ≤ fa if

(cid:19)

where Φ is the standard model Higgs doublet, while φ is

Then, the complex scalar acquires a VEV

φ =

f + σ + iη
√
2

(58)

and the U (1)L is spontaneously broken giving rise to
the right-handed Majorana mass matrix and leading to
a Goldstone boson η, the majoron. Consequently the
Lagrangian will induce the new scattering processes for
neutrinos depicted in Fig. 9.

As usual we have to ensure that at least one sterile
neutrino does not equilibrate before TEW (see [104, 105]
for a recent discussion in the standard high-scale or res-
onant leptogenesis). As in the previous cases we have
to consider the decay σ → NiNi and the annihilation
into majorons, Fig. 9. The former gives the strongest
constraint, as in eq. (15):

Mσ ∼ f ≥ 2 × 105 − 5 × 106GeV.

(59)

These lower bounds for mN = 1 and 100 GeV are shown
by the horizontal lines in Fig. 10.

A. Dark Matter

There are two candidates in this model for dark matter
that we consider in turn: the Majoron and the lightest
sterile neutrino, N1.

1. Majoron

In this model a natural candidate for dark matter is the
majoron itself, but it has to acquire a mass, therefore be-
coming a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). One
possibility is to appeal to gravitational eﬀects [106, 107].
However, the contribution to the mass from gravitational
instantons is estimated to be [108–110]

mη ∼ MP e− MP
f ,

(60)

and therefore extremely tiny, unless f is close to the
Planck scale.

Another alternative is to consider a ﬂavoured U (1)X
and soft symmetry breaking terms in the form of yukawa
couplings [111, 112]. This possibility has been studied in
detail in ref.
[112]. It has been shown that the majoron
can be the main component of dark matter for sterile
neutrino masses mN ≥ 105 GeV, while for masses in the
range we are interested in (mN ∼ 1 − 100 GeV) neither
thermal production via freeze-out nor via freeze-in works.

10

FIG. 10: Constraints in the plane f − mη considering the
Majoron as the only dark matter component. The re-
gion in gray below the dashed line is excluded from CMB
measurements[114], while the light red region below the solid
(dashed) line is excluded in order not to spoil ARS for MN =
100 (1) GeV.

The possibility to produce it via vacuum misalignment,
analogous to the one which produces the axion relic den-
sity has also been discussed in [112].
It was shown to
give a negligible contribution compared to the thermal
one, because the majoron gets a temperature dependent
mass at early times. Even if the mass of the majoron
is signiﬁcantly smaller in our situation, with lighter mN ,
we ﬁnd the same result, ie. that only a small fraction of
the DM can be produced via misalignmet.

No matter what the production mechanism is if the
majoron constitutes the dark matter, there are con-
straints from the requirement that the majoron be stable
on a cosmological timescale and its decay to the light
neutrinos

Γ(η → νν) =

1

i m2

(61)

should not spoil the CMB anisotropy spectrum[113, 114].
This gives constraints on the mass mη and the symmetry
breaking scale f , as showed in Fig.10

As in the axion case there are additional constraints
from supernova cooling [115], but they are much weaker
and give an upper bound much lower than the range
shown in Fig. 10. In the unconstrained region in Fig. 10,
ARS leptogenesis and majoron DM could in principle
work provided the mechanism to generate the majoron
mass does not involve further interactions of the sterile
neutrinos.

2. Sterile Neutrino

We want now to consider the sterile neutrino as a dark
matter candidate, a possibility already explored in [116,
117] in a model with a real scalar ﬁeld and therefore no
Majoron. In our case the presence of the Majoron could
make the sterile neutrino unstable, given that it would
decay through the channel

Γ(N → νη) =

(cid:19)2

1
32π

(cid:18) mN
f

mν

(62)

Thus one has to assume that the Majoron has a larger
mass so that this decay is kinematically forbidden.

As in the B − L case, BO leptogenesis is driven by
the other two heavier neutrino states N2,3, while N1 can
be produced through freeze-in from σ → N1N1 decay.
Assuming σ is in thermal equilibrium with the bath the

FIG. 11: Dark matter relic density as a function of the Yukawa
coupling hN of the lightest sterile neutrino. The gray region
identiﬁes 0.01 < ΩDM h2 < 0.12, that is to say a sterile neu-
trino contribution to DM density between 10 and 100%. Tak-
ing (cid:104)Φ(cid:105) ∼TeV, this region corresponds to mN1 ∼ keV

As a consequence we see that if one couples the B − L
scalar also to the heavier neutrinos, the interactions are
too fast and the BO mechanism cannot work since the
bound in eq. (59) is not satisﬁed. Alternatively, if we
assume eq. (59), then

mN ∼ O(MeV).

(70)

Such a massive neutrino would need extremely small
active-sterile mixing angle (collectively labeled θ) to be
suﬃciently long-lived. The strongest bound from X-rays
[118] give

sin2(2θ) (cid:46) few × 10−6

(72)

The mass of the DM candidate is related to the cou-
pling which regulates the freeze-in process through the
VEV of φ

mN1 = hN1(cid:104)φ(cid:105),

therefore if Mσ ∼ (cid:104)φ(cid:105), the coupling needs to be

hN1 ∼ 10−9 − 10−8,

(67)

(68)

as shown in Fig. 11.

If mN1 is the keV range so that it can satisfy cosmolog-
ical and astrophysical constraints, the scale of the VEV
should be

(cid:104)φ(cid:105) ∼ TeV.

(69)

In conclusion, either we consider a global symmetry with
diﬀerent family charges, more concretely a (B − L)1, or
we need to require extremely tiny yukawa coupling for the
DM sterile neutrino, making this last model theoretically
unappealing.

VI. CONCLUSION

The extension of the Standard Model with three heavy
majorana singlets at the weak scale can explain neutrino
masses and also account for the baryon asymmetry in
the Universe via the oscillation mechanism [8, 9]. This
scenario could be testable in future experiments. Un-
fortunately the simplest model cannot easily accommo-
In the νMSM [9], one of the three
date dark matter.

heavy states is in the keV range and provides a candidate
for dark matter, but it requires huge lepton asymmetries
that cannot be naturally achieved in the minimal setup.
In this paper we have explored three extensions of the
minimal scenario that can accommodate dark matter
without spoiling baryogenesis. This is non trivial because
new interactions of the heavy singlets can disrupt the nec-
essary out-of-equilibrium condition which is mandatory
to generate a lepton asymmetry. We have shown that a
extension of the minimal model with a U (1)B−L gauge
interaction can achieve this goal. The two heavier majo-
rana fermions take part in the generation of the baryon
asymmetry, while the lighest one in the keV range, N1,
is the dark matter. In contrast with the νMSM the pro-
duction of the dark matter is not via mixing, but it is
dominated by the B − L gauge boson decay. The mixing
is however what controls the decay of the N1 and can be
made suﬃciently small to avoid the stringent X-ray con-
straints. The correct DM abundance is achieved for very
small B − L gauge couplings, gB−L (cid:46) 10−8, which are
safely small not to disturb the baryon asymmetry, which
remains the same as in the minimal model. Such tiny
couplings are far below the reach of colliders. Supernova
and BBN provide the most stringent constraints in the
relevant region of parameter space, while future searches
in SHIP might have a chance to touch on it.
We have also considered an extension involving an in-
visible axion sector with an extra scalar doublet and a
complex singlet. The heavy majorana singlets get their
mass from the PQ breaking scale [45]. DM is in the form
of cold axions, from the misalignment mechanism and as
is well known, the right relic abundance can be achieved
for a large value of the PQ breaking scale, fa (cid:39) 1011GeV.
We have shown that such large scale is compatible with
having the heavy neutrinos in the 1-100 GeV scale, and
ARS leptogenesis. Finally we have considered the singlet
majoron extension of the minimal model, with a global
U (1)B−L, that contains two potential DM candidates,
the majoron or the lightest heavy neutrino, N1. Unper-
turbed ARS baryogenesis requires a relatively high B −L
breaking scale, f (cid:38) 106 GeV. Majoron DM requires ex-
otic production scenarios, while neutrino DM works for
masses around MeV, which requires extremely small mix-
ings to make it suﬃciently long-lived, or alternatively a
less theoretically appealing possibity, where the scalar
couples to only one sterile neutrino, while the other two
have tree level masses or couple to a diﬀerent scalar with
a larger VEV.
As a general rule, adding new interactions that aﬀect the
heavy Majorana singlets modiﬁes leptogenesis in the min-
imal model and viable extensions that can explain DM
are likely to involve the freeze-in mechanism as in the
examples above.

Appendix A: Computation of momentum averaged
rates in gauged B − L

In this appendix we give some details on the compu-
tation of the momentum averaged rates in eq. (24). The
