ABSTRACT

Context: In order to better understand the underlying process and prerequisites for solar activity, it is essential to study the time evo-
lution of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of solar active regions (ARs) associated to ﬂare activity.
Aims: We investigate the coronal magnetic energy and helicity budgets of ten solar ARs, around the times of large ﬂares. In particular,
we are interested in a possible relation of the derived quantities to the particular type of the ﬂares that the AR produces, i.e., whether
they are associated with a CME or they are conﬁned.
Methods: Using an optimization approach, we employ time series of 3D nonlinear force-free magnetic ﬁeld models of ten ARs, cov-
ering a time span of several hours around the time of occurrence of large solar ﬂares (GOES class M1.0 and larger). We subsequently
compute the 3D magnetic vector potentials associated to the model 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld using a ﬁnite-volume method. This
allows us to correspondingly compute the coronal magnetic energy and helicity budgets, as well as related (intensive) quantities such
as the relative contribution of free magnetic energy, EF/E (energy ratio), the fraction of non-potential (current-carrying) helicity,
|HJ|/|HV | (helicity ratio), and the normalized current-carrying helicity, |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2.
Results: The total energy and helicity budgets of ﬂare-productive ARs (extensive parameters) cover a broad range of magnitudes,
with no obvious relation to the eruptive potential of the individual ARs, i.e., whether or not a CME is produced in association with
the ﬂare. The intensive eruptivity proxies, EF/E and |HJ|/|HV |, and |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2, however, seem to be distinctly diﬀerent for ARs that
produced CME-associated large ﬂares compared to those which produced conﬁned ﬂares. For the majority of ARs in our sample, we
are able to identify characteristic pre-ﬂare magnitudes of the intensive quantities, clearly associated to subsequent CME-productivity.
Conclusions: If the corona of an AR exhibits characteristic values of (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) > 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) > 0.2, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) > 0.005, then the
AR is likely to produce large CME-associated ﬂares. Conversely, conﬁned large ﬂares tend to originate from ARs that exhibit coronal
values of (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.002.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares are powerful explosive events observed in the so-
lar atmosphere that often occur in association with coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). During ﬂares, a vast amount of magnetic en-
ergy is released, converted into particle acceleration, kinetic en-
ergy of mass ejections, plasma heating, and leading to enhanced
emission of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum (see
reviews by Fletcher et al. 2011; Benz 2017). The underlying
physical process involves accumulation of free magnetic en-
ergy in the corona by induced electric currents, which is even-
tually released by magnetic reconnection (for a review see, e.g.,
Priest & Forbes 2002; Shibata & Magara 2011). While smaller
ﬂare events tend to be conﬁned in nature (i.e., are not accom-
panied by a CME), large ﬂares mostly show an eruptive char-
acter (i.e., they are associated with a CME; see, e.g., Svestka
& Cliver 1992; Andrews 2003; Yashiro et al. 2005). CMEs
carry plasma and embedded magnetic ﬁeld into the interplane-
tary space and can cause major geomagnetic storms upon inter-
action with Earth's magnetosphere (e.g., Tsurutani et al. 1988;
Koskinen et al. 2017).

Over the last two decades, many attempts have been under-
taken to forecast ﬂares. Some of these ﬂare prediction methods
rely on the characterization of distinct features at photospheric
levels, based on observed magnetic ﬁeld or intensity images,

within the host active region (AR). Other so-called statistics-
based approaches utilize information on prior ﬂare activity only.
Barnes et al. (2016) systematically compared such ﬂare predic-
tion methods and showed that the diﬀerent approaches have a
comparable ﬂare prediction ability but require further improve-
ment. Leka & Barnes (2003, 2007) concluded in their study that
the information contained in the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld at
any particular time is limited. This is because the parameters de-
duced from the 2D imprint of the intrinsically 3D coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld, underestimate essential aspects which contribute to a
ﬂare process (see also, e.g., Barnes & Leka 2006).

Signiﬁcant progress has also been made in understanding the
physical requirements for the occurrence of CMEs. Diﬀerent ap-
proaches have been developed based on observations or model-
ing to assess whether a ﬂare is likely to be eruptive (i.e., CME-
associated) or conﬁned (for a review on CME prediction meth-
ods, see Sect. 3 in Green et al. 2018). Wang & Zhang (2007)
examined 14 X-class ﬂares and found that the location of a ﬂare
within the host AR plays a signiﬁcant role. In particular, con-
ﬁned large ﬂares tend to originate from locations closer to the
AR center, while eruptive ﬂares more likely originate from the
AR periphery. Baumgartner et al. (2018) analyzed 44 ﬂares of
GOES class (cid:62) M5.0 and also noted that conﬁned large ﬂares pri-
marily originate from locations close to the ﬂux-weighted center

of the ARs. In contrast, ﬂares tend to be eruptive if originating
from compact ARs (i.e., ARs whose characteristic distance be-
tween the ﬂux-weighted magnetic polarity centers is (cid:46) 60 Mm)
or if they originate from the periphery of ARs.

Concerning the coronal pre-requisites for ﬂare productivity,
observation-based 3D modeling of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld de-
livered important insights. The free magnetic energy previously
stored in the AR corona appears to be related to the frequency
and size (magnitude) of upcoming ﬂares (e.g., Jing et al. 2010;
Su et al. 2014). A certain pre-ﬂare free magnetic energy con-
tent, however, is not decisive whether a ﬂare will occur, as not
necessarily all of the coronal free magnetic energy is released at
once during a ﬂare (e.g., Gilchrist et al. 2012). These ﬁndings
suggest that dissipative quantities, such as the magnetic ﬂux or
the free magnetic energy, have a limited ability for ﬂare predic-
tion, as they are not uniquely related to the complexity of the
ﬂare-involved magnetic ﬁeld. In this respect, magnetic helicity
has a number of advantageous properties, as it depends not only
on the strength but is also unique to the structure of the underly-
ing magnetic ﬁeld. In addition, contrary to magnetic energy, it is
very well conserved even in non-ideal dynamics Berger (1984).
Tziotziou et al. (2012) found a robust correlation between the
free magnetic energy and the magnetic helicity in ﬂaring ARs,
and suggested that magnetic helicity represent an essential in-
gredient in addition to free energy for large solar eruptions. Park
et al. (2008) noted that the coronal magnetic helicity accumu-
lates at a nearly constant rate, and stagnates prior to the onset of
individual ﬂares. Therefore, studying the time variations of the
magnetic helicity and the free energy can help us to better under-
stand the evolution of the active region corona, and the process
leading to a ﬂare and CME.

Magnetic helicity is a measure of geometrical complexity
of the magnetic ﬁelds, summing the individual contributions of
twist and writhe, as well as the interlinking of magnetic struc-
tures (Moﬀatt 1969). It is a conserved quantity of ideal magneto-
hydrodynamics (MHD), and almost conserved in resistive MHD
(Taylor (1974); Berger & Field (1984); Pariat et al. (2015)). The
basic deﬁnition of magnetic helicity is gauge invariant only for
magnetically closed systems, i.e., where no ﬁeld threads the con-
sidered volume’s boundary. For applications to open systems,
such as the solar corona, Berger & Field (1984) and Finn & An-
tonsen (1985) formulated a relative measure for the total helicity
within a considered volume, V, in the form,

HV =

(cid:90)

V

(A + A0) · (B − B0) dV,

(1)

where B is the ﬁeld under study, and B0 is the reference ﬁeld
that is usually assumed to be potential (current-free) and shares
the normal component with B on the boundary of V. Further-
more, A and A0 are the respective vector potentials satisfying
B = ∇ × A and B0 = ∇ × A0. The gauge-invariant formulation
of HV in Eq. (1) is conserved, both in ideal and resistive MHD
(Linan et al. 2018), but is not additive (Valori et al. 2020).

Equation (1) can be decomposed as, HV = HJ + HPJ (Berger

1999, 2003), with
(cid:90)

HJ =

(A − A0) · (B − B0) dV,

V

and,

HPJ = 2

where HJ is the magnetic helicity of the current-carrying (non-
potential) component of the magnetic ﬁeld, and HPJ

volume-threading helicity between B0 and B. Both HJ and HPJ
are separately gauge invariant but are not individually conserved
quantities neither in ideal nor resistive MHD (Linan et al. 2018).
In recent years, a number of studies have been carried out
to comprehensively study the relative magnetic helicity and its
individual contributors (HJ and HPJ) using MHD simulations.
Pariat et al. (2017) studied seven diﬀerent 3D visco-resistive
MHD simulations of the emergence of a twisted magnetic ﬂux
rope into a stratiﬁed atmosphere. In their study, they observed
higher values of HJ during the pre-eruptive phase in those simu-
lation runs which produced a CME-like ejection. Another major
ﬁnding of their study was that the ratio of the current-carrying
helicity to the total helicity, |HJ|/|HV | ("helicity ratio"), discrim-
inates eruptive from non-eruptive cases already at very early
stages of the simulations. Moreover, the values of the helicity ra-
tio were several times higher for the eruptive simulations in com-
parison to the non-eruptive simulations, with |HJ|/|HV | (cid:38) 0.45
before the model eruption. Zuccarello et al. (2018) investigated
ﬁve diﬀerent line-tied MHD simulations involving torus insta-
bility as a trigger for eruption. They noted a common value of
|HJ|/|HV | (cid:39) 0.3 prior to the onset of the torus instability, for all
eruptive simulations. Such high values were not observed for any
other investigated quantity.

Also, recent observation-based model works suggest that the
helicity ratio has a great ability to characterize the eruptive po-
tential also of solar ARs. James et al. (2018) were the ﬁrst to
provide an observation-based estimate of the helicity ratio, based
on a 3D nonlinear force-free (NLFF) model of the AR 11504.
They found a value of |HJ|/|HV | (cid:39) 0.17, one hour prior to the
onset of an eruptive ﬂare. Thalmann et al. (2019b) studied the
time evolution of |HJ|/|HV | during the disk passage of AR 11158
and AR 12192, based on time series of NLFF models. They re-
ported values of |HJ|/|HV | (cid:38) 0.17 before major eruptive ﬂares
that originated from AR 11158, and lower values prior to the
large conﬁned ﬂares that originated from AR 12192. In recent
follow-up studies by Moraitis et al. (2019) and Thalmann et al.
(2020), similar values of |HJ|/|HV | (cid:38) 0.15 were observed before
the eruption of an eruptive X9.3 ﬂare from AR 12673.

Based on these exemplary case studies, it appears that the he-
licity ratio is a promising candidate to discriminate ARs which
produce large eruptive ﬂares from ARs that produce mostly con-
ﬁned ﬂares. This motivates us to perform a ﬁrst comprehensive
study, including a larger number of ARs, and to analyze in detail
the time evolution of the coronal magnetic energy and helicity
before and around the time of large ﬂares (GOES class M1.0
and larger). In particular, we are interested in the coronal char-
acteristics of the ARs under study, depending on the ﬂare type
(eruptive or conﬁned) and investigate the evolution of helicity
and energy-based proxies and test their ability to indicate the
eruptive potential of solar ARs.

2. Data and methods

2.1. Active region sample

We select ten solar ARs that produced large ﬂares (GOES class
M1.0 and larger). Five of those ﬂare-productive ARs were the
source of predominantly CME-associated ﬂares (AR 12673,
11158, 11429, 12297, 11890), whereas the majority of large
ﬂares that originated from the other ﬁve ARs were conﬁned (AR
12192, 12268, 11302, 11339, 11166). We note here that nine of
these selected ARs were analyzed in Avallone & Sun (2020) re-
garding their degree of current neutralization, polarity inversion
line (PIL), magnetic shear, and the unsigned magnetic ﬂux.

For each AR, we consider a time interval of 6–10 hours
around the largest ﬂare produced by the AR that occurred close
to disk center. The corresponding ﬂare type (conﬁned or erup-
tive) was veriﬁed using the LASCO CME catalog (Gopalswamy
et al. 2009) and from Table 1 in Toriumi et al. (2017). Our AR
sample is brieﬂy summarized in the following (and see also Ta-
ble 1 for corresponding information).

– AR 12673 produced two X-class ﬂares on 2017 Septem-
ber 6. The ﬁrst one was a conﬁned X2.2. ﬂare (SOL2017-
09-06T08:57). The second ﬂare (SOL2017-09-06T11:53)
started 2.6 hours later, and was the largest ﬂare of cycle 24.
This eruptive X9.3 ﬂare was accompanied by a fast (v ≈ 1570
km/s) halo CME according to the SOHO/LASCO CME cat-
alog1. This is the only AR in our sample for which two large
ﬂares occur within the selected analysis time window of 10
hours.

– AR 11158 produced an X2.2 ﬂare (SOL2011-02-15T01:44)

accompanied by a halo CME (v ≈ 670 km/s).

– AR 11429 produced an X5.4 ﬂare (SOL2012-03-07T00:02)

accompanied by a fast halo CME (v ≈ 2680 km/s).

– AR 12297 produced an X2.1 ﬂare (SOL2015-03-11T16:11)

that was associated with a slow CME (v ≈ 240 km/s).

– AR 11890 produced an X1.1 ﬂare (SOL2013-11-08T04:20)
with a slow CME (v ≈ 340 km/s; see the event 25 of Table 1
in Toriumi et al. (2017), and Korsós et al. (2020)).

– AR 12192 produced numerous GOES M- and X-class ﬂares,
all except one conﬁned. Thalmann et al. (2015) and Sun et al.
(2015) suggested, the strong background ﬁeld in AR 12192
to be the reason for the conﬁnement of the ﬂares that pre-
vented an otherwise unstable ﬂux rope from erupting. Our
study here focuses on the conﬁned X3.1 ﬂare (SOL2014-10-
24T21:07).

– AR 12268 produced solely conﬁned ﬂares (Zhong et al.
2019). Here, we analyze the coronal evolution around the
conﬁned M2.0 ﬂare (SOL2015-01-30T00:32).

– AR 11302 produced a conﬁned M4.0 ﬂare (SOL2011-09-

26T05:06).

– AR 11339 produced only C- and M-class ﬂares. Here, we
focus on the conﬁned M1.8 ﬂare (SOL2011-11-05T20:31).
– AR 11166 produced a conﬁned X1.5 ﬂare (SOL2011-03-

09T23:13).

2.2. Magnetic ﬁeld modeling and helicity computation

The application of Eq. (1) to the solar corona is hampered by
several diﬃculties, most severely by our inability to measure
the coronal magnetic ﬁeld reliably on a routine basis (e.g., re-
views by Cargill 2009; Wiegelmann et al. 2014). Therefore, the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld is typically approximated by a nonlinear
force-free (NLFF) ﬁeld within a ﬁnite volume, which requires
the measured surface vector magnetic ﬁeld as an input (see re-
views by Wiegelmann & Sakurai 2012; Wiegelmann et al. 2017).
The particular approach used in our study is an optimiza-
tion method, applied to appropriate boundary conditions (de-
duced from observed photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld mea-
surements) to numerically iterate for an approximate solution to
the force-free equations, j × B = 0 and ∇ · B = 0, within a chosen
computational domain. We apply the method of Wiegelmann &
Inhester (2010) using the 12-min cadence hmi.sharp_720s data,
constructed from polarization measurements of the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). The
data set is binned by a factor of two to a spatial resolution of
0.06 degrees (∼720 km at the disk center).

The magnetic ﬁeld modeling involves two computational
tasks. First, a preprocessing of the observed vector magnetic
ﬁeld data (Wiegelmann et al. 2006) is required in order to obtain
a force-free consistent bottom boundary. Second, based on the
preprocessed boundary data, the NLFF corona above the AR is
approximated by applying a combination of the improved opti-
mization scheme of Wiegelmann & Inhester (2010) and a multi-
scale approach (Wiegelmann et al. 2008).

In a recent study, Thalmann et al. (2020) investigated the ef-
fect of particular choices of free model parameters, both dur-
ing preprocessing and optimization, onto subsequent magnetic
helicity computation. It was found in their study that the appli-
cation of preprocessing with default parameters (including the
smoothing of the originally observed vector data) improves the
NLFF model quality, in terms of force-freeness and solenoidal-
ity (see also Wiegelmann et al. 2006). It was also shown that
further improvement of the solenoidality of the NLFF models
can be achieved by enhancing the relative importance of the
volume-integrated divergence compared to the importance of the
volume-integrated Lorentz force, minimized during optimiza-
tion. Therefore, in our study, we analyze two time series of NLFF
models for each AR, one time series of equally strong weighting
of the 3D force- and divergence freeness (w f = wd = 1; see Eq.
(4) in Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010), and one time series with
an enhanced weighting of the volume-integrated divergence (on
the expense of force-freeness; w f = 1, wd = 2).

To determine the force-free consistency of the NLFF models,
we calculate the current-weighted angle between the modeled
magnetic ﬁeld and the electric current density, θJ (e.g., Schri-
jver et al. 2006). For a completely force-free ﬁeld, θJ = 0. We
note here that the average θJ in our NLFF models, for all of the
considered ARs and most times during the analysis time inter-
vals, is (cid:46) 15◦ (see Fig. (A.1) in the Appendix A). In order to
determine the degree of solenoidality of a given B, Valori et al.
(2013) introduced a relative measure which expresses the frac-
tion of the total magnetic energy (E) that is related to the non-
zero divergence (Ediv), in the form Ediv/E. For completeness,
we show the corresponding values for each AR in Fig. (A.2) in
the Appendix A. Dedicated studies showed that a maximum of
Ediv/E = 0.1 is to be tolerated for subsequent magnetic helicity
computation (Valori et al. 2016; Thalmann et al. 2019a; Moraitis
et al. 2019). Correspondingly, we analyze the coronal magnetic

A&A proofs: manuscript no. main

helicity and energy (and related quantities) only for those NLFF
models that satisfy the above criterion, i.e., omit the analysis of
those models for which Ediv/E > 0.1.

In order to be able to compute the relative helicities from
Eqs. (1)–(3), we apply the method of Thalmann et al. (2011)
to compute the vector potentials A and A0, corresponding to
B and B0, respectively. The method solves systems of partial
diﬀerential equations to obtain the vector potentials A and A0,
using the Coulomb gauge, ∇ · A = ∇ · A0 = 0. The method
has been tested in Valori et al. (2016) and is known to deliver
helicities in line with that of other methods.

2.3. Quantities investigated

For each time instance of the NLFF model time series of the
ARs, we compute the total (E), potential (E0) and free (EF) mag-
netic energy, as well as the total (HV ), volume-threading (HPJ)
and current-carrying (HJ) relative helicities. We compute aver-
ages of those quantities, together with a corresponding spread,
for those time instances where both NLFF models qualify for
analysis, i.e., where Ediv/E ≤ 0.1 for both. If only one of the
NLFF models at a given time instant qualiﬁes for analysis, we
keep only the corresponding single values. We note here that in
addition we excluded one data point from the time series mod-
eling of AR 12673 due to an unusual high value of θj > 35◦ at
11:35 UT (see Fig. A.1(a)). Subsequently, we calculate the in-
tensive quantities such as helicity ratio, |HJ|/|HV |, energy ratio,
EF/E, and the normalized helicities, |HV |/φ(cid:48)2 and |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2. Here,
the magnetic ﬂux used for normalization is calculated as half of
the total unsigned ﬂux that is shown in Fig. (1), i.e., from the
relation φ(cid:48) = 1
2

|Bz| dS .

(cid:82)
S (z=0)

From the time proﬁles of the quantities introduced above,
we estimate a "characteristic" pre-ﬂare level as follows. Taking
into account all data points within a time window of ﬁve hours
prior to ﬂare onset, we compute the mean value (hereafter called
"time-averaged" and denoted by angular brackets) and standard
deviation. For completeness we note that the retrieved values do
not signiﬁcantly vary if the width of the pre-ﬂare time windows
is between 3-6 hours. Only for AR 11166, the time-averaged
values are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent if the pre-ﬂare time window is
less than 3 hours.

3. Results

In the following Sect. 3.1, we describe the evolution of the ex-
tensive quantities, including the unsigned magnetic ﬂux, φ, he-
licities, HV , HPJ, HJ, and the magnetic energies, E and EF. In
Sect. 3.2, we discuss the evolution of intensive quantities derived
from the extensive quantities. To further explore these quantities
in detail, we analyze the characteristic time-averaged pre-ﬂare
values of the extensive and intensive quantities in Sect. 3.3.

3.1. Extensive Quantities (Magnetic ﬂux, magnetic energies

and relative helicities)

For each of the ARs under study, the time evolution of the mag-
netic ﬁeld related quantities is described in detail, and discussed
in context with previous studies (if existing). For all quantities
we compute average values from the two diﬀerent NLFF model
time series at each time instant. The corresponding spread (ex-
cept for time instances where only one valid NLFF solution is
found) is indicated by an adjacent shaded area.

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the unsigned magnetic ﬂux
(black curve) along with the GOES soft X-ray light curves (blue)
for each of the 10 ARs. The unsigned magnetic ﬂux values
range over about one order of magnitude (from 2.9 × 1022 Mx
to 1.9 × 1023 Mx). Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the mag-
netic helicity, HV (black curve), and the contribution of volume
threading helicity, HPJ (blue curve). The time evolution of the
non-potential helicity, HJ, for each AR, is shown in Fig. 3. We
ﬁnd the absolute values of the relative helicities, HV , HPJ and
HJ, to span roughly three orders of magnitude, in the approxi-
mate range of 3.3 × 1040 Mx2 to 6 × 1044 Mx2. Figure 4 displays
the evolution of the free magnetic energy, EF. Figure 5 shows the
evolution of total magnetic energy E (black curve) and the en-
ergy of the potential magnetic ﬁelds E0 (blue curve). ARs host-
ing a higher unsigned magnetic ﬂux also harbor a higher E. In
contrast to total energy E, no clear relation to the underlying un-
signed magnetic ﬂux is obtained for the free magnetic energy
EF, which may be expected, since it is related to the presence of
electric currents. In the following, we discuss the time evolution
of the average magnetic helicities and energies for each event:

– For AR 12673, the relative magnetic helicity, HV , was neg-
ative with magnitudes up to ≈ 3.8 × 1043 Mx2 prior to the
onset of the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare (black curve in Fig. 2(a)).
Similar values have been reported by Moraitis et al. (2019),
Vemareddy (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Thalmann et al.
(2020). Individual contributions of HJ (Fig. 3(a)) and HPJ
(blue line in Fig. 2(a)) display the same sign and temporal
evolution as HV . Also in agreement to these earlier studies,
we ﬁnd maximum pre-ﬂare values of the free magnetic en-
ergy, EF ≈ 7.5 × 1032 erg, before the onset of the eruptive
ﬂare (Fig. 4(a)).

– The relative magnetic helicity, HV , in AR 11158 before the
start of the ﬂare attains a maximum value of ≈ 6.7×1042 Mx2
(Fig. 2(c)). The time proﬁle and magnitudes of the relative
helicity are in overall agreement with the results presented by
Jing et al. (2012, 2015) and Thalmann et al. (2019b). Helici-
ties, HJ and HPJ, as shown in Figs. 3(c) and 2(c) respectively,
are positive. The free magnetic energy is EF ≈ 2.3 × 1032 erg
(Fig. 4(c)) for two hours before the ﬂare onset. Similar val-
ues were reported by Sun et al. (2012) and Thalmann et al.
(2019b).

– For AR 11429, we ﬁnd HV to be negative and on the order of
≈ 7.5×1043 Mx2 before the ﬂare (Fig. 2(e)), in accordance to
the sign of helicity obtained, for example, by Ye et al. (2018)
and Elmhamdi et al. (2014). HJ and HPJ are also negative,
and show a similar trend as HV (see Figs. 3(e) and 2(e), re-
spectively). The free magnetic energy is considerably high
with pre-ﬂare EF ≈ 1.1 × 1033 erg (Fig. 4(e)).

– In AR 12297, the magnetic helicities, HV , HPJ, HJ, are with
positive sign, and gradually decrease throughout the consid-
ered time period (see Figs. 2(g) and 3(g), respectively). HV
prior to the ﬂare onset is ≈ 1.80 × 1043 Mx2. The free mag-
netic energy (EF) is almost constant (EF ≈ 3.3 × 1032 erg)
prior to the ﬂare onset (Fig. 4(g)).

– In AR 11890, HV is positive and increases up to ≈ 1.5 ×
1043 Mx2 before the ﬂare (Fig. 2(i)). HJ and HPJ are also pos-
itive, and show a similar trend as HV (see Figs. 3(i) and 2(i),
respectively). The free energy, EF, is ≈ 1.2 × 1032 erg prior to
the ﬂare onset (Fig. 4(i)). Both, HJ and EF are lowest among
all of the studied CME-productive ARs.

– Magnetic helicities in AR 12192 around the conﬁned X3.1
ﬂare are negative in sign (Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)). The spread in
helicity and energy related quantities is higher in AR 12192

Figure. 1 Time evolution of the magnetic ﬂux, φ, and the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux for the 10 ARs under study. Quantities for ARs productive of
large eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares are shown in the left and right column, respectively. Black curve represents the average of the magnetic ﬂuxes
calculated from NLFF bottom boundary ﬁelds based on enhanced (standard) divergence freeness as indicated by squares (bullets). The gray shaded

in comparison to other ARs. This is because the spread in the
unsigned ﬂux is approximately 10 times higher than the other
ARs. Consequently, this spread in the underlying model ﬂux
values also causes a higher spread in rest of the model based
quantities such as magnetic energy and helicity. The absolute
value of the relative magnetic helicity, HV ≈ 58 × 1043 Mx2

is more or less constant through out the time series. The free
energy, EF (Fig. 4(b)), is ≈ 1.9×1033 erg before the ﬂare. Our
values are in line with those of the earlier study of Thalmann
et al. (2019b). We note that Jing et al. (2015) reported corre-
sponding estimates of HV and EF by a factor of 10 lower.

Figure. 2 Time evolution of the relative magnetic helicity HV and volume threading helicity HPJ for the 10 ARs under study. Quantities for ARs
productive of large eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares are shown in the left and right column, respectively. Squares (bullets) indicate the solutions based
on enhanced (standard) divergence freeness. The gray (light-blue) shaded areas mark the spread of HV (HPJ), and the solid-black (dashed-blue)
curve indicate the respective average values of HV (HPJ). The vertical bar marks the impulsive ﬂare phase.

– Around the conﬁned M2.0 ﬂare, the relative magnetic helic-
ity of AR 12268 is negative, and HV increases up to a peak
value of ≈ −1 × 1043 Mx2 before the ﬂare (see Fig. 2(d)). HJ
is nearly constant, while HPJ is increasing, before the ﬂare
(Fig. 3(d) and 2(d), respectively). The pre-ﬂare values of the
free energy, EF ≈ 0.9 × 1032 erg, are the lowest among all the
ARs studied here.

– Around the conﬁned M4.0 ﬂare produced by AR 11302, HV
is negative and the absolute values of HV ranges between
−1.75 × 1043 Mx2 and −3.2 × 1043 Mx2 during the analyzed
time interval (see Fig. 2(f)). The free energy, EF, ﬂuctuates
between 1.5 × 1032 erg and 3 × 1032 erg (Fig. 4(f)).

– Around the conﬁned M1.8 ﬂare in AR 11339, HV is neg-
ative and the values are in the range (−2, −3.6) × 1043 Mx2
(Fig. 2(h)). The decomposition of the relative magnetic helic-

ity, HJ and HPJ are also negative and largely vary throughout
the time series (Fig. 3(h) and 2(h)). Unlike other ARs in this
study, the total magnetic energy, E, is increasing during the
ﬂare (Fig. 5(h)), and the free energy, EF, is almost constant
(EF ≈ 2.8 × 1032 erg) at the time of the ﬂare (Fig. 4(h)).

– Around the conﬁned X1.5 ﬂare produced by AR 11166, HJ
and HPJ are of opposite sign throughout the time series, ex-
cept for the short interval when HPJ reverses from positive

to marginally negative and then back to positive values (see
Fig. 3(j) & 2(j)). Also, the average relative magnetic helic-
ity decreases from a value of 2.4 × 1042 Mx2 at 18:00 UT to
−0.4 × 1042 Mx2 at 20:00 UT (Fig. 2(j)). Vemareddy et al.
(2012) in their study of AR 11166 observed patches of neg-
ative helicity ﬂux embedded in the positive helicity ﬂux site
of the ﬂare, with similar values of magnetic helicity accumu-

from a positive to negative value, HJ does not change sig-
niﬁcantly. The free energy increases to a maximum value of
EF ≈ 1.8 × 1032 erg prior to the onset of the ﬂare.

In summary, all our overall helicity budgets agree in sign and
magnitude with that recovered in previous studies (if existing).
HV is negative in six ARs (AR 12673, AR 12192, AR 12268,
AR 11302, AR 11339), and positive in three ARs (AR 11158,
AR 12297, AR 11890). Only AR 11166 exhibits a reversal of the
sign of helicity, i.e., a transition from a positive to a marginally
negative coronal helicity budget. The absolute values of HV de-

crease considerably during the eruptive ﬂares. For the majority
of ARs, HJ shares the sign of HV . Only for AR 11166, we ﬁnd
the sign of HJ being opposite to that of HV during most of the
time interval studied. For all the analyzed ARs, the absolute val-
ues of HJ decrease largely during the eruptive ﬂares. HJ values
are not distinctive to the magnitude or type of the ﬂares hosted
by the individual ARs. In all of the analyzed ARs, HPJ shares
the sign of HV . Similar to HJ, we see a notable decrease in HPJ
during the eruptive ﬂares. The absolute values of HV , HJ and
HPJ span a broad range, and appear not to be related to the size
(magnitude) or type (conﬁned or eruptive) of the observed ﬂares.

Similarly, the values of the total magnetic energy E of the
ARs are not distinguishable for diﬀerent magnitudes or type of
the ﬂares. In general, E shows a decreasing trend during the
ﬂares, except in case of AR 11339, where E is increasing dur-
ing the conﬁned M4.0 ﬂare. The free magnetic energy, EF, in
general, also decreases during the ﬂares. Only for AR 11339,
EF remains almost constant over the course of the ﬂare. Also,
similar to other extensive quantities, EF does not show any dis-
crimination to the magnitude or type of ﬂares produced.

3.2. Intensive quantities (non-potential helicity ratio, free

energy ratio, and normalized helicities)

Based on the time evolution of the extensive quantities presented
in Sect. 3.1, we are able to study the corresponding time evolu-
tion of the intensive ones. In the following, overall trends visible
in the deduced time proﬁles of the intensive quantities are qual-
itatively described, while a quantitative analysis is presented in
Sect.. 3.3. In Figs. 6–9, the time evolution of helicity and energy-
based intensive quantities are shown, including the non-potential
helicity ratio (|HJ|/|HV |), the free energy ratio (EF/E), the nor-

malized non-potential helicity (|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2), and the normalized to-
tal helicity (|HV |/φ(cid:48)2).

Figure 6 shows the time evolution of the non-potential he-
licity ratio, |HJ|/|HV |. Importantly, we ﬁnd that in general the
level of |HJ|/|HV | before the analyzed ﬂare is signiﬁcantly higher
when it is associated to a CME. Furthermore, |HJ|/|HV | shows a
decreasing trend during all the eruptive ﬂares (see left column
in Fig. 6). Similarly, the pre-ﬂare values of EF/E, as shown in
Fig. 7, are signiﬁcantly larger for the eruptive ﬂares (see left col-
umn in Fig. 7).

The time evolution of the normalized non-potential helicity,
|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2, is shown in Fig. 8 and also exhibits a similar behavior
as the non-potential helicity and free energy ratios. In most of
the eruptive ﬂares, the levels of |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2 are elevated before the
ﬂare and signiﬁcantly decrease over the course of the ﬂare (see
left column in Fig. 8).

The time evolution of the normalized total helicity, |HV |/φ(cid:48)2
shown in Fig. 9, does not reveal characteristically diﬀerent pre-
ﬂare levels for conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares. Its ﬂare-related
change, however, seems to be more pronounced for eruptive

Figure. 7 Time evolution of the energy ratio EF/E for the 10 ARs under study. Layout as in Fig. 3

Given the above trends, only AR 11890 appears to represent
an exceptional case, as it exhibits values of intensive quantities
before the eruptive ﬂare that are otherwise typical for conﬁned
ﬂares. Furthermore, though AR 11166 exhibits immediate pre-
ﬂare values of the intensive quantities similar to that of other
conﬁned ﬂares, we still notice an elevation of the non-potential
helicity ratio, |HJ|/|HV |, during three hours well before the ﬂare
onset. Possible explanations for these exceptions are discussed
in Sect. 4.

3.3. Characteristic pre-ﬂare levels

In the following, we analyze the overall properties of time-
averaged pre-ﬂare levels of all of the quantities. Table 2 lists the
time-averaged pre-ﬂare levels of the extensive quantities (HV ,
HJ, HPJ, E, EF) for our sample of ARs, while in Table 3, we
list the time-averaged pre-ﬂare levels of the intensive quantities
(|HJ|/|HV |, EF/E, |HV |/φ(cid:48)2, |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2).

Summarizing the time-averaged pre-ﬂare levels of the quan-
tities, we ﬁnd absolute time-averaged pre-ﬂare values of the total
helicity, (cid:104)HV (cid:105), in the approximate range of 0.12 × 1043 Mx2 to

59 × 1043 Mx2 (see Col. 3 of Table 2). For all the ARs, we ﬁnd
that (cid:104)HV (cid:105) is dominated by the contribution of (cid:104)HPJ(cid:105) (Col. 5 of
Table 2). We ﬁnd diﬀerences, however, regarding the amount to
which (cid:104)HPJ(cid:105) exceeds (cid:104)HJ(cid:105) (Col. 4 of Table 2). In particular, we
ﬁnd that (cid:104)HPJ(cid:105) exceeds (cid:104)HJ(cid:105) by a factor of (cid:46) 10 for ARs that pro-
duce large eruptive ﬂares (with the sole exception of AR 11890),
whereas it is (cid:38) 10 for all the ARs which were the source of the
large conﬁned ﬂares. The time-averaged pre-ﬂare values of the
total magnetic energy, (cid:104)E(cid:105) (Col. 6 of Table 2), are in the approx-
imate range (1 − 18) × 1033 erg. Furthermore, the time-averaged
pre-ﬂare values of the free energy, (cid:104)EF(cid:105) (last column of Table 2),

span the approximate range (0.9 − 20) × 1032 erg. The aforemen-
tioned trends of the pre-ﬂare averages of the extensive quantities
show that they are not discriminative of the ﬂare type (conﬁned
or eruptive).

The time-averaged pre-ﬂare values of the normalized helic-
ity, (cid:104)|HV |/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105), are in the approximate range (0.4 – 9) ×10−2, and
are not distinctly diﬀerent for the two types of ﬂares. The situa-
tion is diﬀerent for the time-averaged pre-ﬂare values of the other
intensive quantities, (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105), (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105), however,

4. Discussion

We investigated the magnetic helicity and energy budgets of ten
ﬂare-productive active regions around the time of occurrence of
large ﬂares (GOES class M1.8-X9.3). Our goal was to identify
characteristic pre-ﬂare magnetic energy and helicity budgets and
to inquire regarding a possible relation to the type of ﬂare pro-

duced (conﬁned or eruptive). Thus, we computed relative mag-
netic helicities by applying a ﬁnite volume method. The helic-
ity and energy computations are based on 3D coronal magnetic
ﬁelds that are reconstructed based on a nonlinear force-free ap-
proach (see Sect. 2.2 for details).

Dedicated studies have been performed using solar-like
MHD simulations, or observation-based force-free modeling of
individual solar ARs. Those pioneering studies already pointed
toward the potential of intensive quantities, and in particular that
of the non-potential helicity ratio, to indicate the eruptive char-

tematically analyze in detail the time evolution of extensive (HV ,
HJ, HPJ, E, EF) as well as intensive (|HJ|/|HV |, EF/E, |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2,
|HV |/φ(cid:48)2) quantities, during an extended time window before and
around the occurrence of large solar ﬂares.

Our results on the extensive quantities agree with past stud-
ies of the same ARs (if existing; see description of individual
ARs in Sect. 3.1.We ﬁnd no indication for extensive quantities,
such as the total and free magnetic energy or the relative helic-
ities, to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in the pre-ﬂare corona of large
ﬂares that are eruptive or conﬁned (see values listed in Table 2).
This is in agreement with earlier ﬁndings in that regard, based
on either MHD simulations (Pariat et al. 2017) or observation-
based studies (Moraitis et al. 2019; Thalmann et al. 2019b). Also
in agreement with these earlier studies, we ﬁnd that the normal-
ized total helicity, |HV |/φ(cid:48)2, is not distinctly diﬀerent for ARs
hosting large eruptive or conﬁned ﬂares (see ﬁfth column in Ta-
ble 3). However, the situation is diﬀerent for the other intensive
quantities (Table 3), as discussed in the following.

We ﬁnd that most of the analyzed events fall in one of two
categories. One which exhibits time-averaged pre-ﬂare values of
(cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) > 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) > 0.2, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) > 0.005. Four
out of ﬁve eruptive ﬂares fall into this category. Another category
of ARs exhibits time-averaged pre-ﬂare values of (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) (cid:46)
0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.002. Four out of ﬁve con-
ﬁned ﬂares hosted by these ARs fall into this category. Only two
ARs of our sample cannot be unambiguously grouped to either
of the two aforementioned categories, because they show unex-
pected values in at least one of the intensive quantities listed

above. In the following, we provide possible explanations for
those two ARs.

AR 11890 exhibits

time-averaged pre-ﬂare levels of
(cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1 and (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, that are typical for the con-
ﬁned ﬂares in our sample. A possible explanation for the CME
having occurred anyways is its relative position with respect to
the AR center, as it originated from the peripheries of AR 11890
(consistent with the ﬁndings in Baumgartner et al. (2018) about
the ﬂare locations within ARs). Another example of this kind is
AR 12192, which clearly falls into the category of non-eruptive
ARs. Though the majority of ﬂares hosted by that AR were con-
ﬁned (all M- and X-class ﬂares except one) a narrow CME (not
studied here) was produced during one M-class ﬂare which also
originated from the periphery of the AR (e.g., Thalmann et al.
2015). This indicates that the helicity and free energy ratio might
only be indicative for eruptive vs. conﬁned ﬂare activity of the
AR core ﬁelds, but not for ﬂares taking place in the periphery of
ARs.

The largest ﬂare produced by AR 11166, and analyzed in
our work, was conﬁned, yet does the AR exhibit a time-averaged
pre-ﬂare value of |HJ|/|HV |, typical for ARs that host large erup-
tive ﬂares. The reason, now in retrospect, is explained easily.
First, the conﬁned nature of the X1.5 ﬂare was actually excep-
tional, as the CME-productivity of the AR was in general not
low (11 out of 20 M- and C-class ﬂares had an associated CME;
see Yashiro et al. (2011)). This highlights the importance to in-
vestigate the time evolution of a solar AR during its entire disk
passage, i.e., not only around individual ﬂare events and possi-

bly already starting at the time of AR emergence, when trying
to assess its eruptive potential. Second, high values for the time-
averaged pre-ﬂare |HJ|/|HV | were found due to signiﬁcant varia-
tions of the magnitude of the total helicity during the considered
pre-ﬂare time window of ﬁve hours (see Fig. 2(j)). In compari-
son, for the immediate pre-ﬂare corona, covering about one hour
prior to the start of the conﬁned X1.5 ﬂare, one would indeed
ﬁnd |HJ|/|HV | < 0.1, i.e., as for the other large conﬁned ﬂares
studied. This highlights the need to better understand the (pre-
ﬂare) time scales relevant for ﬂare processes.

Finally, we stress that also the most promising intensive
quantities,|HJ|/|HV |, EF/E, and |HJ|/φ(cid:48)2, are only suggestive of
whether or not an AR may produce an eruptive large ﬂare
at some later stage in time. However, they are not indicative,
whether or not the next occurring ﬂare will be conﬁned or erup-
tive. As an example, AR 12673 exhibited pre-ﬂare values prior
to the analyzed eruptive X9.3 ﬂare that are characteristic for a
CME-productive AR. However, it also produced a major con-
ﬁned X2.2 ﬂare a few hours earlier, for which the pre-ﬂare av-
erages were not drastically diﬀerent, but partly even larger than
prior to the eruptive ﬂare.

the overlying ﬁeld (Wang & Zhang 2007; Baumgartner et al.
2018). In exceptional cases (ARs 11890 and 12192), we have
seen that a CME may erupt if it emerges from the periphery of
an AR, even though the helicity and energy ratio of the underly-
ing active region corona are untypical for CME-productive ARs.
Therefore, we assume our measures to be representative mainly
for the AR cores, where strong currents reside, and thus the gross
of free magnetic energy and current-carrying (non-potential) he-
licity resides.

As a conclusion, we may say that an AR exhibiting coronal
values of (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) (cid:46)
0.002 is unlikely to produce large eruptive ﬂares from its AR
core. On the other hand, we may safely assume that if the active-
region corona exhibits values of (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) > 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) > 0.2,
and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) > 0.005, the underlying AR is likely to produce a
large eruptive ﬂare subsequent in time.

5. Summary and Conclusions

We performed a ﬁrst comprehensive study of a sample of ten
ARs, for a detailed analysis of the time evolution of the coro-
nal magnetic energy and helicity around the time of large ﬂares
(GOES class ≥M1.0). We computed the relative magnetic he-
licity using the ﬁnite volume method of Thalmann et al. (2011)
based on NLFF modeling (Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010). Our
major ﬁndings are as follows:

i) The extensive quantities (E, EF, HV , HJ, HPJ) cover a broad
range of magnitudes with their pre-ﬂare levels, being not
discriminative regarding the eruptive potential of the ﬂare-
producing AR.

ii) Among the intensive quantities, |HV |/φ(cid:48)2, is not distinctly
diﬀerent for ARs that produce an eruptive or conﬁned ﬂare.
However, the other intensive quantities, such as the helicity
ratio (|HJ|/|HV |), the energy ratio (EF/E) and the normalized
non-potential helicity (|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2) are able to distinguish the
pre-ﬂare corona of ARs that possibly produce a large erup-
tive or conﬁned ﬂare. We ﬁnd characteristic pre-ﬂare val-
ues of (cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) > 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) > 0.2, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) >
0.005 for ARs that produce large eruptive ﬂares. For ARs
that produce mostly large ﬂares that are conﬁned, we ﬁnd
(cid:104)|HJ|/|HV |(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, (cid:104)EF/E(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.1, and (cid:104)|HJ|/φ(cid:48)2(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.002.
iii) All helicity related intensive quantities studied here show
a pronounced response during the ﬂare if it was associated
with a CME.

These major ﬁndings support that the combined analysis of
intensive quantities (energy ratio and helicity ratio) allows it to
successfully characterize the potential of an AR to produce a
CME. Such an analysis, however, does not allow it to unambigu-
ously determine the ﬂare type of the next occurring (upcoming)
ﬂare, i.e., whether or not the next occurring ﬂare will be erup-
tive or conﬁned. For instance, pre-ﬂare values characteristic for
CME-productivity are found for both, a preceding conﬁned and
a subsequent eruptive X-class ﬂare in AR 12673. Therefore, be-
sides the coronal pre-requisites being met for CME-productivity,
the reasons for eruptive ﬂares to occur must also be sought for
elsewhere, among others, including the particular location within
an AR where a ﬂare occurs and the strength and orientation of

Manu Gupta et al.: Magnetic helicity and energy budget around large conﬁned and eruptive solar ﬂares

Appendix A: Quality metrics

To determine the force-freeness of a NLFF modeled ﬁeld, the
current-weighted average of the sine of the angle between the
modeled magnetic ﬁeld and the electric current density (see,
Wheatland et al. 2000; Schrijver et al. 2006) is calculated as,

σJ = sin θJ =


(cid:88)



i

|J i × Bi|
Bi



 /

(cid:88)

Ji,

i

(A.1)

where θJ = sin−1 σJ is then, the current-weighted angle between
the B and J . For a completely force-free ﬁeld, σJ = 0, since
θJ = 0.

In order to quantify the solenoidality (divergence freeness)
of a magnetic ﬁeld, Valori et al. (2013) introduced a parameter,
Ediv/E, which expresses the non-solenoidal fraction of the total
energy based on the decomposition
E = 1
8π

B2 dV

(cid:90)

V

= E0,s + E0,ns + EJ,s + EJ,ns + Emix.

(A.2)

Here E0,s and EJ,s are the energies of the solenoidal components
of the potential (E0) and current-carrying (EJ) magnetic ﬁeld,
respectively, while E0,ns and EJ,ns are the energies of the corre-
sponding non-solenoidal components. All contributing energies,
except for Emix, are positive deﬁnite. Emix is the energy corre-
sponding to all cross terms (see Eq. (8) in Valori et al. (2013)).
The energy associated with all non-solenoidal components can
then be deﬁned as

Ediv = E0,ns + EJ,ns + |Emix|.

(A.3)

Usually, E0,s > EJ,s > Emix > EJ,ns > E0,ns (see, e.g., DeRosa
et al. 2015). In case of a perfectly solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld, one
ﬁnds E0,ns = EJ,ns = Emix = 0, and therefore Ediv = 0.

For each AR under study, the values of θJ and Ediv/E are
shown in Fig. A.1 & A.2, respectively. NLFF model time series
with enforced lower residual divergence exhibit lower values of
Ediv/E (see square symbols in Fig. A.2), at the slight expense
of force-freeness (compare Fig. A.1). Average values of θJ are
below 15 degrees at most of the time instances. Also, average
values of Ediv/E are (cid:46) 0.1 for most time instances considered for
the individual ARs. We remind the reader here that only NLFF
solutions exhibiting values of Ediv/E < 0.1 are qualifying for
subsequent helicity computation. All others are excluded from
further analysis.

Figure. A.1 Quality metric θJ at each time instant for the 10 ARs under study. The left column shows ARs that produce large
eruptive ﬂares, the right column shows ARs that produce large conﬁned ﬂares. Squares (bullets) show θJ of the solutions based on
enhanced (standard) divergence freeness. The gray shaded areas mark the spread of θJ, and the black curve indicate the average
values. The vertical bar marks the impulsive ﬂare phase.
