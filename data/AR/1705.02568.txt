ABSTRACT

The magnetic ﬁelds in the solar corona are generally neither force-free nor
axisymmetric and have complex dynamics that are diﬃcult to characterize. Here
we simulate the topological evolution of solar coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines (MFLs)
using a magnetohydrodynamic model. The simulation is initialized with a non-
axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic ﬁeld that best correlates with the observed
vector magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs). To focus on these ideas, sim-
ulations are performed for the ﬂaring AR 11283 noted for its complexity and well-
documented dynamics. The simulated dynamics develops as the initial Lorentz
force pushes the plasma and facilitates successive magnetic reconnections at the
two X-type null lines present in the initial ﬁeld.
Importantly, the simulation
allows for the spontaneous development of mass ﬂow, unique among contempo-
rary works, that preferentially reconnects ﬁeld lines at one of the X-type null
lines. Consequently, a ﬂux rope consisting of low-lying twisted MFLs, which ap-
proximately traces the major polarity inversion line, undergoes an asymmetric
monotonic rise. The rise is attributed to a reduction in the magnetic tension force
at the region overlying the rope, resulting from the reconnection. A monotonic
rise of the rope is in conformity with the standard scenario of ﬂares. Importantly,
the simulated dynamics leads to bifurcations of the ﬂux rope, which, being akin
to the observed ﬁlament bifurcation in AR 11283, establishes the appropriateness
of the initial ﬁeld in describing ARs.

Introduction

The solar corona is generally treated as a magnetized plasma with high electrical con-
ductivity whose evolution is determined by the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

 
 
 
 
 
 
– 2 –

(Priest 2014). The large magnetic Reynolds number RM (vL/η, in usual notations) of the
corona allows the plasma to achieve its non-diﬀusive limit (Aschwanden 2004). Consequently,
Alfv´en’s theorem of ﬂux freezing is satisﬁed, ensuring magnetic ﬁeld lines (MFLs) to remain
tied to ﬂuid parcels during evolution (Alfv´en 1942). In contrast, instances of various eruptive
events (ﬂares, coronal mass ejections) occurring in the corona are believed to be signatures
of magnetic reconnection (MR): the topological rearrangement of MFLs along with the con-
version of magnetic energy into heat and the kinetic energy of mass motion (Shibata &
Magara 2011). To trigger MRs, the value of RM needs to be lowered, which can be attained
by a reduction in L, the length scale determining the gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld. A
vanishing L can either pre-exist in a magnetic topology in the form of various two- and
three-dimensional nulls and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), or develop autonomously. The
autonomous development is assured by the Parker’s magnetostatic theorem (Parker 1972,
1988, 1994), which claims that discontinuities of the magnetic ﬁeld are ubiquitous in an
inﬁnite electrically conducting plasma in equilibrium, because the ﬂux-freezing condition
and the equilibrium generally cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously by a magnetic ﬁeld that is
continuous everywhere. In an evolving ﬂuid, MHD simulations establish the autonomous re-
duction of L and the occurrence of consequent spontaneous reconnections as the ﬂuid relaxes
toward a quasi-steady state under a nearly precise maintenance of ﬂux freezing (Kumar et al.
2015a; Kumar & Bhattacharyya 2016; Kumar et al. 2016). However, in these studies, the
initial bipolar magnetic ﬁelds were constructed analytically, reducing the natural complexity
often observed in active regions (ARs).

Without a direct measurement (Wiegelmann & Sakurai 2012), the coronal ﬁelds are nu-
merically extrapolated from the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds based on a force-free assump-
tion; i.e. exert no Lorentz force is exerted (R´egnier 2013). The corresponding analytical
expressions of the force-free ﬁeld (in spherical polar coordinates) are often obtained under
the assumption of axisymmetry (Low & Lou 1990; Prasad et al. 2014). However, such a
symmetry generally does not exist in the real case, as many vector magnetograms depict the
photospheric magnetic ﬁelds to be morphologically complex.

In force-free coronal ﬁeld extrapolations, the use of nonlinear-force-free-ﬁeld (NLFFF)
models where the ﬁeld line twist is a function of position but constant along a ﬁeld line
(Wiegelmann 2008) is customary. The model is well known to give good ﬁts to magne-
tograms, yielding a realistic coronal ﬁeld line topology. For instance, Guo et al. (2013)
performed NLFFF extrapolation for NOAA 10720 and found coronal ﬂux ropes wrapped
around by a particular set of QSLs, whereas Inoue et al. (2012) found that in AR 10930, the
X-ray intensity associated with the sigmoid is more sensitive to the strength of the electric
current rather than the twist of the ﬁeld lines. Furthermore, many recent works (Jiang et al.
2013; Kliem et al. 2013; Amari et al. 2014; Inoue et al. 2014, 2015; Savcheva et al. 2015,

– 3 –

2016) have realistically modeled the coronal eruptive dynamics by using MHD simulations
initialized with NLFFFs (see also a review by Inoue (2016)).

Although simulations based on NLFFF are capable of reproducing realistic dynamics,
further issues need to be addressed. Speciﬁcally, the force-free approximation is based on
the assumption of negligible plasma β in the corona, where β is the ratio of gas pressure
to magnetic pressure. However, according to Gary (2001), it is only in the mid-corona—
sandwiched between the photosphere and the upper corona—that the plasma β is negligible.
To mitigate this problem, a ‘preprocessing’ technique is often performed on the data to
remove the force in the vector magnetogram and obtain a suitable boundary condition for
NLFFF extrapolations (Wiegelmann et al. 2006; Jiang & Feng 2014).

An alternative to NLFFF extrapolation is an approach based on a magnetic ﬁeld model
of the corona derived from the variational principle of the minimum energy dissipation rate
(Hu & Dasgupta 2008; Hu et al. 2008, 2010). It is shown that the extrapolated ﬁeld lines
from the resulting non-force-free-ﬁeld (NFFF) model reasonably agree with the observed
coronal loops and MFLs extrapolated using NLFFF. Central to the NFFF extrapolations
is the double-curl Beltrami ﬁeld obtained by Bhattacharyya et al. (2007), which is a dis-
sipating self-organized state. Kumar & Bhattacharyya (2011) have also shown the same
double-curl Beltrami ﬁeld to be the minimum total energy state of a two-ﬂuid magneto-
plasma. One particular analytical solution of the double-curl equation can be formulated
by superposing two linear-force-free ﬁelds (LFFFs) characterized by constant twists every-
where cf. Steinhauer & Ishida (1998) & Mahajan & Yoshida (1998) for details. Kumar &
Bhattacharyya (2011) utilized such formalism to obtain NFFFs with twisted MFLs resem-
bling coronal loops. A NFFF relevant to observations of AR 11283 was recently obtained
by Prasad & Bhattacharyya (2016) by using the ﬁeld in conjunction with semi-analytical
constructs where non-axisymmetric solutions are best correlated with vector magnetograms.
Interestingly, the obtained NFFF yields a magnetic morphology where regions of the sharpest
magnetic ﬁeld gradient were found to be cospatial with the ﬂaring site. To further establish
NFFFs in describing the corona, it is imperative to assess the credibility of the obtained
magnetic ﬁeld in reproducing the observed evolution of ARs. Speciﬁcally, in this paper,
we perform numerical simulations with the non-axisymmetric NFFF as the initial condition
and compare the evolution with the recorded dynamics of AR 11283. Importantly, unlike
contemporary works that require a prescribed ﬂow to induce dynamics (Amari et al. 2003;
Aulanier et al. 2010), here the inherent non-zero Lorentz force serves that purpose.

To incorporate possible spontaneous reconnections (Kumar et al. 2016), the simulations
are performed in congruence with the the magnetostatic theorem. For this purpose, an
incompressible thermally homogeneous magnetoﬂuid with inﬁnite electrical conductivity is

allowed to relax to a quasi-steady state via viscous relaxation (Bhattacharyya et al. 2010;

The constants B0 and L0 are generally arbitrary, but can be ﬁxed by the magnetic
ﬁeld strength and size of the system. Also, va ≡ B0/
4πρ0 is the Alfv´en speed and ρ0
is the constant mass density. The constants τa and τν have dimensions of time, and rep-
resent the Alfv´en transit time (τa = L0/va) and viscous diﬀusion time scale (τν = L2
0/ν),
respectively, with ν being the kinematic viscosity. The ratio τa/τν can be interpreted as
an eﬀective viscosity, which, along with other forces, determines the dynamics. The pres-
sure perturbation, p, about a thermodynamically uniform ambient state satisﬁes the elliptic
boundary value problem, which is generated by imposing the discretized incompressibility
constraint (equation (2)) on the discrete integral form of the momentum equation (equa-
tion (1)); cf.(Bhattacharyya et al. 2010) and the references therein. An identical procedure
involving the gradient of an auxiliary potential in the induction equation (equation (3)) is
employed to keep B solenoidal, see Ghizaru et al. (2010) and Smolarkiewicz & Charbonneau
(2013) for details.

If released from non-equilibrium, the initial Lorentz force will push the plasma and
generate mass motion which is dissipated by the viscosity. With the ﬂux freezing condition

– 5 –

satisﬁed, the magnetic ﬁeld cannot decay out completely but the terminal kinetic energy
is expected to be zero because of viscous dissipation. In the corresponding numerical sim-
ulation scales inevitably become under-resolved and numerical artifacts such as spurious
oscillations are generated through the employed numerical techniques. These underresolved
scales can be removed by utilizing an appropriate numerical diﬀusivity of the non-oscillatory
ﬁnite diﬀerence algorithm. In the literature, such calculations relying on the non-oscillatory
numerical diﬀusivity are referred to as the Implicit Large Eddy Simulations (ILESs), (Grin-
stein et al. 2007). The computations performed in this work are in the spirit of ILESs and
the simulated MRs, being intermittent in space and time, mimic physical reconnections in
high-RM ﬂuids.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 highlights the important steps in
constructing the non-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic ﬁeld. In Section 3, the numerical
model is brieﬂy discussed. The results of the simulation are presented in Section 4. Finally,
in Section 5 we summarize the results and highlight key ﬁndings.

Initial magnetic ﬁeld

The initial NFFF B is generated by superposing two linear force-free ﬁelds, B1 and B2

(Bhattacharyya et al. 2007; Kumar & Bhattacharyya 2011):

The constant κ is the relative amplitude of the superposing ﬁelds. Being linear-force-free,
the B1 and B2 satisfy (Chandrasekhar 1956; Chandrasekhar & Kendall 1957)

B = B1 + κB2.

(10)

∇ × Bi = αiBi,

(11)

where i = 1, 2. The constant αi represents the torsion coeﬃcient (Parker 2012) for the ﬁeld
Bi and α2 = (1 + γ)α1 with γ measuring the deviation of B from being linear-force-free. A
convenient expression of Bi in spherical polar coordinates is

Bi =

αi

∇ × ∇ × ψir + ∇ × ψir,

(12)

where r is the radial vector. The scalar eigenfunction ψi satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation

Further, to make Bi physically meaningful without having inﬁnite energies at r = ∞
(Seehafer 1978), we bound it above by conﬁning the MFLs in a spherical shell of radius
r0 ≤ r ≤ r1 (Prasad & Bhattacharyya 2016). Consequently,

ψi

lm(r, θ, φ) =[jl(αir)yl(αir1) − jl(αir1)yl(αir)]Plm(cos θ) exp(imφ),

(15)

where r0 is the inner radius of the shell selected to avoid singularity at the origin.

To simulate the solar AR ﬁeld using B, we follow the mathematical steps described in
Prasad et al. (2014), which provide fast and reasonably good ﬁts to vector magnetograms.
The procedure involves generating of two-dimensional vector magnetogram templates from
three-dimensional analytical solutions computed over the volume spanned by the spherical
shell. To achieve this, a plane tangential to the shell at a location r(cid:48) is constructed, and
the components of B are computed on this plane. The plane is identiﬁed by a speciﬁc AR
cutout whose orientation can further be changed by varying the two Euler angles θ(cid:48) and ψ(cid:48);
see Figure 1. Finally, the best correlated B at the cutout is obtained by maximizing

c =

(cid:104)(B · BO)|BO|(cid:105)
(cid:104)|B|3(cid:105)1/3(cid:104)|BO|3(cid:105)2/3 ,

(16)

which correlates B with the ﬁeld BO obtained from the magnetogram. Explicitly, the param-
eters α1, l, m, κ and γ, and the variables r0, r1, r(cid:48), θ(cid:48), ψ(cid:48) are obtained by maximizing c. Using
this technique, Prasad et al. (2014) analyzed vector magnetograms for AR 10930 spanning
a period of three days with two X-class ﬂares. Their estimates for the changes in free energy
and relative helicity of the AR before and after the ﬂares were found to be in good agreement
with those obtained from other NLFFF extrapolations. In this work, we use vector magne-
tograms from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI)(Schou et al. 2012) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO)(Pesnell et al. 2012). The HMI (hmi.sharp cea 720s data se-
ries) provides full-disk vector magnetograms of the Sun with a spatial resolution of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5 and
a temporal cadence of 12 minutes. The magnetogram BO is initially remapped to a Lambert

– 7 –

cylindrical equal-area projection and then transformed into heliographic coordinates (Gary
& Hagyard 1990). The selected vector magnetogram is for the AR 11283 on 2011 September
6 at 21:00 (Figure 2 a), the same AR as discussed in Prasad & Bhattacharyya (2016) but
observed at an earlier time. The AR produced an X- class ﬂare on 2011 September 6, peaked
around 22:20 hr, and was followed by a coronal mass ejection (Feng et al. 2013; Janvier et al.
2016). The initial magnetic ﬁeld is constructed by using the magnetogram data at 21:00 hr,
which documents that the magnetic ﬁeld is morphologically complex with a strong bipolar
region and other weaker diﬀuse ﬁeld regions (Figure 2).

The details of the parameters for the best correlated non-axisymmetric NFFF are given
in Table 1 and the corresponding MFLs (top and side views) are shown in Figure 2 b and
Figure 3. The ﬁgures are overlaid with the contours of Bz on the z = 0 plane, which

conﬁrm the overall morphological similarity of the constructed ﬁeld with the magnetogram
in terms of having strong bipolar and weaker diﬀuse ﬁeld regions. The MFLs connecting the
strong polarity regions are twisted loops, having the appearance of a forward S, and hence
resembles sigmoid emission in AR 11283 seen by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
94 ˚A channel (Jiang et al. 2013). The ﬁeld B has two-dimensional X-type nulls (Figure 4)
constituting the two null lines, marked by X1 and X2. The location of the nulls is determined
using the technique reported in Kumar et al. (2015b). To further analyze the initial ﬁeld
line geometry, in Figure 5(a), we identify four sets of twisted MFLs (colored red, yellow,
green and gray), structurally resembling a magnetic ﬂux rope, which is a stack of magnetic
ﬂux surfaces (MFSs) spanned by twisted ﬁeld lines (Schrijver & Siscoe 2009). To closely
examine the resemblance, Figure 5(b) plots a group of MFLs (in color red) with circularly
distributed initial footpoints. The circle is marked by the curve P with its center located
at (x, y, z) = (0.23, 0.66, 0). Notably, the ﬁgure conﬁrms the MFLs to be to be twisted by
approximately a half turn (angle π) about the central axis. Such visual conﬁrmation of twist
in ﬁeld lines has also been done in Jiang et al. (2014). After tracing the loop trajectories in
the computational domain, the locus of the endpoints of the MFLs generate a second closed
curve P1 on the z = 0 plane. Since ﬁeld lines cannot intersect each other, the group of
MFLs generating the two closed curves must have a single common axis, which is identiﬁed
as the central axis of the rope. Further, MFLs join the closed curves and are tangential to a

– 8 –

surface, making it a MFS (Bhattacharyya et al. 2010). By changing the radius of the circle,
a co-axial stack of MFSs is generated (Figure 5(c)) which, within the accuracy of the ﬁeld
line integration scheme, is identiﬁed as a magnetic ﬂux rope. Further analysis (not reported)
ﬁnds a threshold for the radius of the circularly distributed initial points, above which the
loci of the endpoints are no longer closed curves and do not give rise to a ﬂux rope.

3. Numerical model

To solve the MHD equations (1)-(4), we utilize the well established magnetohydrody-
namic numerical model EULAG-MHD (Smolarkiewicz & Charbonneau 2013), which is an
extension of the hydrodynamic model EULAG predominantly used in atmospheric and cli-
mate research (Prusa et al. 2008). For the completeness, here we mention only important
features of the EULAG-MHD and refer the readers to Smolarkiewicz & Charbonneau (2013)
and references therein for detailed discussions. The model is based on the spatio-temporally
second-order accurate non-oscillatory forward-in-time multidimensional positive deﬁnite ad-
vection transport algorithm, MPDATA (Smolarkiewicz 2006). Importantly, the MPDATA
has a proven dissipative property, which is intermittent and adaptive, allowing the formation
of underresolved scales in ﬁeld variables for a selected grid resolution. In the magnetoﬂuid
undergoing viscous relaxation, sharpening of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is expected to be
unbounded, ultimately leading to MRs at locations where the separation of non-parallel ﬁeld
lines approaches the grid resolution. The MR process per se is underresolved, but eﬀectively
regularized by the local second-order residual dissipation of MPDATA, which is suﬃcient to
sustain the monotonic nature of the solution. Being intermittent and adaptive, the residual
dissipation facilitates the model performing ILESs that mimic the action of explicit subgrid-
scale turbulence models (Margolin et al. 2006) whenever the concerned advective ﬁeld is
underresolved. Such ILESs performed with the model have already been successfully uti-
lized to simulate magnetic reconnections (MRs) to understand their role in the development
of various magnetic structures in the solar corona (Kumar et al. 2016, 2015a). The simu-
lations presented continue to rely on the eﬀectiveness of ILES in regularizing the onset of
MRs.

4. Simulation results

The simulations are performed on a 128 × 128 × 128 grid, resolving the normalized
computational domain Γ spanning [0, 1] × [0, 1] × [0, 0.25] (respectively in x, y, and z); see
Figure 1, where a unit length is equivalent to 50 Mm. The vertical extent of the domain is

– 9 –

constrained by the condition that the magnetic ﬁeld is to be contained within the ﬂux surface
at r1 in Figure 1. The simulations start from a motionless state with the NFFF obtained
in Section 2. To ensure net zero magnetic ﬂux through Γ, the volume magnetic ﬁeld B
is continued to the domain boundaries (Kumar et al. 2015a). The dimensionless constant
τa/τν ≈ 7×10−3, which is two orders of magnitude larger than its coronal value. To calculate
τa, we set ρ0 = 1. Notably, the larger value of τa/τν only speeds up the computation because
of a more eﬃcient viscous dissipation by the increased eﬀective drag. With time being
normalized by τa, a unit of the Alfv´en transit time can be interpreted as ≈ 15 minutes of
HMI data. With a constant mass density, ﬂow in the computation is incompressible—an
assumption also used in other works (Dahlburg et al. 1991; Aulanier et al. 2005). Although
compressibility is important for the thermodynamics of coronal loops (Ruderman & Roberts
2002), our focus is on elucidating the changes in magnetic topology idealized with a thermally
homogeneous magnetoﬂuid. Throughout the simulation, the maximum plasma β varies
in the range {0.003, 0.007} and the ﬂuid Reynolds number RF ≈ 102, which reasonably
approximate the coronal values. The non-force-free nature of the initial ﬁeld can be assessed
from the histogram and the direct volume rendering of |J × B|/|∇(B2/2)| for the initial ﬁeld
(Jiang & Feng 2012) as shown in Figure 6, where we ﬁnd most of the values populated in
the range {0.005, 0.01}. Additionally, with zero resistivity RM = ∞ and the ﬂux freezing
is satisﬁed throughout evolution, except during reconnections. Consequently, the MFLs
evolve in response to unbalanced forces (including Lorentz force) pushing the plasma. The
plasma motion then naturally incorporates line-tied boundaries, which is conventional in
coronal simulations (Schrijver & Siscoe 2009). In addition, coronal simulations may require
more sophisticated boundary treatment to replicate the observed dynamics (Jiang et al.
2013). An evolution of ﬁeld lines by forcing the plasma inevitably makes the footpoints to
move appreciably. A recent work concurs by suggesting the rapid evolution of photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld during major eruptive events (Sun et al. 2017). Nevertheless, we have also
performed simulations where the bottom boundary of the domain is kept ﬁxed (not shown).
A diﬀerent ﬂux rope, co-located with the gray colored rope (Figure 5a) and having similar
connectivity, replicates the reported evolution.

Figures 7 and 8 show the top and side views of a sequence of snapshots from the evolution
of the overlying MFLs to the ﬂux rope colored red in Figure 5(a). Until reconnection at t =
2.2, the rope is located mostly above the main polarity inversion line (PIL) which separates
the two strong opposite polarity regions R1 and R2. The ﬁgure is further overlaid with the
X-type null lines X1 and X2 (in gray). Evidently, the initial MFLs of the rope are twisted
while being anchored at the z = 0 plane. The sequence indicates an overall anti-clockwise
rotation of the overlying ﬁeld lines, the rope, and the strong polarity regions. The ﬂux rope
also expands along with preferential reconnections at the null line X1. To assess the eﬀect of

– 10 –

rotation on the preferential reconnection, we plot streamlines at t = 0.4 near X1 and X2, as
shown in Figure 9. As evident from the ﬁgure, the streamlines favor a clumping of oppositely
directed ﬁeld lines in the neighborhood of X2, leading to reconnections. However, near X1,
the streamlines bring ﬁeld lines with the same direction toward the null line and hence no
reconnection occurs. The net result is an asymmetric evolution that favors reconnection at
X2 rather than X1. Being situated closer to the X2, the MFLs overlying the rope reconnects,
ﬁrst resulting in a local decrease of the magnetic tension force.

In response, the ﬂux rope rises vertically while simultaneously getting rotated toward
X2. Figure 10 shows the evolution of the maximum height of the innermost ﬂux surface of
the rope (marked in black) which conﬁrms that the rise is monotonic. Furthermore, the rise
is not symmetric above the two legs of the rope due to the asymmetry of the initial ﬁeld and
the preferential reconnection. Notably, such a result is essentially similar to a more realistic
MHD simulation initialized with an NLFFF performed by Jiang et al. (2013), who show that
the expansion of a low-lying ﬂux rope is assisted by the reconnection of its overlying ﬂux.
Furthermore, MFLs on the outermost surface of the rope (depicted in color red) reconnect,
which partially opens and bifurcates the rope, making it connect region R1 with regions
R2 and R3 (Figure 7). Afterwards, the inner surfaces of the rope (marked in yellow and
black) also bifurcate in a similar way, leading to the breakup of the rope. The concept of
ﬂux-rope bifurcation is well-established and responsible for the possible drainage of mass
Importantly, the evolution of the
in an ascending ﬁlament (Gibson & Fan 2006, 2008).
AR 11283 also documents two-pronged pitchfork-type bifurcations of the associated ﬁlament
when observed in the 304˚A channel of the AIA (Lemen et al. 2012) at approximately UT
21:50 (Figure 11). The reasonably faithful simulation of the observed ﬂux rope bifurcation
justiﬁes the credibility of the non-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic ﬁeld in exploring
the coronal dynamics. However, without reproducing the bursty rise of the rope, the present
computations fail to capture the subsequent X-class ﬂare. The failure can be attributed to
either the exclusion of the ﬂux emergence occurring from 22:00 hr onward (Petrie 2012) in
the simulated dynamics, or the requirement of a more accurate method to reconstruct the
initial NFFF. Notably, the vertical component of the emergent ﬁeld, when favorably aligned
with respect to the existing ﬁeld, may reconnect and provide the trigger necessary for the
impulsive rise.

An auxiliary analysis (not shown) indicates an increase in the magnetic ﬂux of MFLs
overlying the ropes, in colors white and green in Figure 5, because of reconnections at X2.
The increased density results in an enhanced magnetic tension force which tethers the white
and green ropes further and inhibit their ascent, whereas the yellow rope situated away from
the main PIL shows an appreciable but non-monotonic rise because of similar tethering by
reconnected ﬁeld lines.

5. Summary and conclusions

This paper numerically simulates the viscous relaxation of a thermally homogeneous
incompressible magnetoﬂuid with inﬁnite electrical conductivity and having an initial non-
axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic ﬁeld. The initial ﬁeld is constructed by forward ﬁtting
a photospheric magnetogram using an analytically non-force-free magnetic ﬁeld. In our cal-
culations, the focus is on AR 11283, with magnetogram from the HMI. Notably, as the initial
ﬁeld is non-force-free and non-axisymmetric, it is able to characterize the basic structural
features of such a complex AR. The corresponding magnetic ﬁeld consists of twisted ﬁeld
lines and two X-type null lines. Most importantly, there exists a sigmoidal ﬂux rope that
roughly matches the observed sigmoid emission. A direct visualization conﬁrms a rope to be
a stack of local MFSs.

As the initial magnetic ﬁeld is not balanced, the Lorentz force naturally trigger evolution.
Subsequently, the favorable forces bring non-parallel ﬁeld lines in close proximity of the null
lines and lead to an unbounded sharpening of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient, which results in
the development of underresolved scales. In the spirit of ILES, the MPDATA then generates
locally adaptive dissipation to regularize the underresolved scales with simulated MRs.

The computation reveals, at one of the X-type null lines, that the initial ﬂow favorably
clumps non-parallel MFLs and triggers MRs. The generated outﬂow makes the two major
polarities rotate, which brings further non-parallel ﬁeld lines toward the X-line and drives
secondary reconnections. In response, the magnetic tension force at regions overlying the
rope decreases and with the reconnections being preferential, results in an asymmetric ascent
of the rope. Although occurring in congruence with the magnetostatic theorem, the evolution
leads to reconnections occurring only at the pre-existing X-type nulls.
Importantly, the
simulation depicts a sequential bifurcation of the rope over a range of time. The images from
the AIA 304 ˚A channel suggest a similar bifurcation of a ﬁlament, which adds credibility to
the use of non-axisymmetric NFFF to represent a complex AR. However, the computations
fail to capture the subsequent X-class ﬂare as the required impulsive ascent of the rope is
missing. We attribute the failure to not accounting for the ﬂux emergence and other solar
surface modiﬁcations between the bifurcation and the ﬂares. For example, the recent data-
driven MHD simulation of the same AR by Jiang et al. (2016), which includes not only the
ﬂux emergence but all other surface motions, accurately replicates the M-class ﬂare at 01:50
hr.

In retrospect, in its basic utilization, the non-force-free non-axisyemmteric magnetic
ﬁeld is useful in modeling ARs and the evolution of the solar corona. The future goal is to
develop a complete numerical scheme that will simulate the dynamics of an AR from such an
initial state to the occurrence of ﬂares, if any. In the backdrop of the successful simulation

– 12 –

of coronal dynamics by Jiang et al. (2016), we believe that a synergetic approach exploiting
the advantages of various numerical models is the key to achieve this goal. For instance,
the fully numerical non-force-free extrapolation model developed by Hu & Dasgupta (2008)
and its subsequent developments (Hu et al. 2008; Gary 2009), rely on self-organized higher-
curl Beltrami ﬁelds (Bhattacharyya et al. 2007; Kumar & Bhattacharyya 2011; Janaki &
Dasgupta 2012) that are morphologically identical to the initial magnetic ﬁeld B. Therefore,
it can be expected that a data-driven MHD simulation of reconnections with the initial ﬁeld
provided by non-force-free extrapolations will provide a more realistic dynamics of the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld and thus warrants further attention.

colors. Notably, a given colored ﬁeld line rotates considerably before intersecting the z = 0

surfaces. The surfaces are made of MFLs plotted with their initial points distributed on
circles having three diﬀerent radii and a common center situated at (x, y) = (0.23, 0.66) on
the z = 0 plane. The corresponding endpoints of the MFLs also form closed curves, enabling
the group of MFLs with a given initial radius to constitute a ﬂux surface. A stack of such
ﬂux surfaces generates a rope.

Fig. 9.— Panels (a) and (b) represent the streamlines of the velocity in the vicinity of X1

parallel MFLs in the close proximity to facilitate reconnection, is important. In contrast, the
orientation of the ﬂow near X1, being less favorable, leads to a delayed onset of reconnection.
The cumulative eﬀect is the asymmetric ascent of the rope.
