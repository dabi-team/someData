Abstract

The thermodynamic aspects of

the polymorphic phase transition from α-indomethacin to

γ-indomethacin are the fundamental key to find the most bioavailable phase of indomethacin. In the

present work, varying the temperature and solvent permittivity changes the polymorphic transitions.

Hence, the thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and entropy of both

indomethacin polymorphs are determined in terms of the solvent permittivity as functions of

indomethacin's temperature in a vacuum, which are crucially related to the stability, spontaneity, and

reversibility of the polymorphic transformation.

INTRODUCTION

A drug can crystallize into different polymorphs, which are characterized by their unique spatial

arrangement with distinct physicochemical properties,

in particular, different

solubilities,

bioavailabilities and degrees of toxicity [1]. Furthermore, one crystalline arrangement can be

transformed into another by the so-called polymorphic phase transition [2]. The understanding on how

to induce or suppress polymorphic phase transitions plays a valuable role in the pharmaceutical

industry concerning the bioavailability and patentability of the medicine development process [1,

3-5].

Notably, indomethacin (C19H16CINO4) is a very common drug mainly prescribed for its

analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties; however, at least seven unique crystalline

forms are known. Among them, the α- and γ-indomethacin polymorphs present high stability and

allow a crystallographic description, while all of the remaining polymorphs of indomethacin are

metastable [6,7]. Here, the thermodynamic properties of indomethacin were investigated in order to

find a phase transition driven by the permittivity of the medium [2], provided that a continuous

variation in a binary mixture produces a continuous variation in its permittivity value, as expressed in

equation (1) [2,8]. The permittivity εm in a binary system composed of two solvents, 1 and 2, whose

permittivities are ε1 and ε2, respectively, can be expressed as follows:

ln εm = a1 ln ε1+a2 ln ε2+a1a2 [K0+K1(a1-a2)+K(a1-a2)2]

(1)

where a1 and a2 are the volumetric fractions of solvents 1 and 2 and Ki represent experimental

constants [8,9]. The permittivity is independent of the system size and therefore an intensive

thermodynamic parameter [10,11].

The importance of this study resides in the fact that, in general, crystals belonging to the same

spatial group have similar physical properties [12,13]. The α- and γ-indomethacin polymorphs belong

to the space groups P21 and P-1 respectively, which in turn are among the five most common space

groups of organic compounds from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC). If more

than one formula in the asymmetric unit is considered in the space groups (by asymmetric unit, a unit

cell composed of more than one chemical compound or molecule, for example, indomethacin and

ethanol exist in a single unit cell), then the five most common space groups are the following: P21/c

(27.8%), P-1 (23.5%), P21 (13.8%), P1 (8.5%) and P212121 (7.8%). On the other hand, if all of the

compounds of the CCDC are considered, the following most common space groups are obtained:

P21/c (36.6%), P1 (16.9%), P212121 (11.0%), C2/c (7.0%) and P21 (6.4%). Therefore, the generality of

the present study is justified by investigating the α- and γ-indomethacin polymorphic phase transition.

Accordingly, ab initio quantum methods (density functional theory, DFT, methods) could be used to

simulate the polymorphic phase transition between α- and γ-indomethacin, which is induced by a

range of distinct permittivity values for solvents at a fixed temperature of 298.15 K [6,7]. This range

2

can be precisely controlled by considering the different proportions of solvents in a binary mixture as

expressed in equation (1) [8,14]. Hence, the change in the composition of the drug delivery vehicle

changes its permittivity, whereas the permittivity and pH values can be related [15,16], and thus,

several polymorphs of indomethacin can be experimentally synthesized by altering the pH of the

solvent [6], allowing a proper polymorphic transition analysis.

The goal of the present work is to characterize the phase transition of the α- and γ-polymorphs of

indomethacin and to establish its thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy and

entropy by varying both the temperature and solvent permittivity in DFT computations, which are

related to the stability, spontaneity, reversibility and bioavailability of the polymorphs and their

transformation.

METHODOLOGY

The Gaussian09 program was initially used to determine standard thermodynamic quantities in a

vacuum such as the enthalpy (H), Gibbs free energy (G) and entropy (S), which are functions for the

α- and γ-indomethacin phases in solvents with different dielectric constant values at a fixed

temperature of 298.15 K for validation of the method. The computation was performed by DFT with

the B3LYP functional using the 3-21G basis set via the polarizable continuum model (PCM) [17-20],

using the integral equation formalism variant (IEFPCM) in the default self-consistent reaction field

(SCRF) computation. To preserve the number of indomethacin molecules, the original formation of

the α-structure inside the solvent consists of the nucleation of six molecules of indomethacin per unit

cell, while the nucleation of the γ-structure inside the solvent demands three indomethacin molecules

per unit cell [21].

Denoting extensive parameters by E1, E2, ...,En and intensive parameters by I1, I2, ..., In, a phase

transition can be defined by a discontinuity in the derivative of thermodynamic functions (denoted by

P) in terms of an intensive parameter Ii [22]. In this way, a n-order phase transition dependent on Ei is

characterized by a discontinuity in the transition point at the (n-1)-th derivative of the function P(Ei

(Ii),Ii), in which Ei is an extensive thermodynamic parameter that depends on the intensive parameters

3

Ii: pressure [23,24], temperature, voltage [25], laser frequency [26], electric field [25], pressure

[27,28], permittivity [11] and so forth. The differential form of the thermodynamic function P(Ei (Ii),Ii)

can be expressed as dP = I1 dE1+ I2 dE2+ ...+In dEn [29]. For the present case, the Gibbs free energy is

G=μN+D2/(8πε), and its differential is given straightforwardly by dG=μdN+DdD/4πε. Therefore,

quantities such as the spontaneity, stability and reversibility of a phase transition can be interpreted by

means of G(Ei (Ii), Ii), H(Ei (Ii), Ii) and S(Ei (Ii), Ii), respectively [14,30]. As a particular case, a

first-order transition is a discontinuity in the function P(Ei (Ii), Ii) [22]. Therefore, the α to γ structural

transition can be described as a first-order phase transition in the entropy as a function of the

permittivity, as will be shown.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Parameters such as the temperature, solvent permittivity, and pressure in the organic crystal or

pH of the medium can significantly modify the stability, solubility and bioavailability of drugs [31,32].

In an effort to improve drug bioavailability knowledge, the solvent permittivity was chosen as the

order parameter for thermodynamic analysis. The standard temperature for the polymorphic phase

transition between the α and γ phases of indomethacin in the vacuum was reached by the

computational method presented in the previous section. The main standard thermodynamic functions,

namely, H(D; ε, P0, T0, N), G(D; ε, P0, T0, N) and S(D; ε, P0, T0, N), were computed for six molecules

of indomethacin (N=6) in terms of the solvent permittivity ε at T0=298.15 K and P0=1 atm.

Theoretical strategy validation: analysis of the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy in a first-order

phase transition

The protocol of the theoretical strategy can be summarized in the correspondence between the

simulated temperature for the structural phase transition from the α- to γ-indomethacin polymorphs

and the current literature, which are reported in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Enthalpy and Gibbs free energy. Comparative enthalpy and Gibbs free energy plots for α- and

γ-indomethacin.

In Figure 1, the enthalpy for both phases of indomethacin increases with the temperature at a

constant rate outside the phase equilibrium, while the Gibbs energy decreases, as expected from the

enthalpy expression H=G+TS [29,33].

The critical transition region is highlighted in the direction of the lower Gibbs free energy due to

the intersection between both Gibbs free energy curves, characterizing the phase balance, which is

corroborated by the current literature, in which the stable phase of γ-indomethacin is achieved at 120

K as well [34,35]. The discontinuity in the Gibbs free energy lies in a temperature range of 793.15 K

to 803.15 K due to the presence of a peak for γ-indomethacin.

Standard thermodynamic parameters as a function of the solvent dielectric constant

The enthalpy and the Gibbs free energy are plotted in Figure 2 for both indomethacin

polymorphs, and their nonlinear behaviors were fitted by the Levenberg Marquardt method, in which

all of the coefficients of determination have a correlation given by R2 = 0.999, in such a way that the

quantities H(D; ε, P0, T0, N), G(D; ε, P0, T0, N) and S(D; ε, P0, T0, N), where S= (H-G)/T, are all

expressed in terms of the permittivity ε. Consequently,

the theoretical predictions for some

transformation properties, such as spontaneity, stability and reversibility, are provided from the

standard expressions for Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy, respectively [30,14].

, in which a,

b and c are constants to be determined. The Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of γ-indomethacin are

smaller than those of α-indomethacin for all permittivity values. Therefore, due to this finding as well

as its high degree of symmetry, the γ-structure is the most stable and therefore the least bioavailable

polymorph of indomethacin [36]. The negative difference between the Gibbs free energies guarantees

6

the spontaneity of the structural transformation from α-indomethacin to γ-indomethacin [9,35]. The

parameters obtained from the fitting protocol are expressed in Table 2.

Finally, the values for the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy for α- and γ-indomethacin are given

by the following equations:

Hα = (-233.83429ε +233.74839)/(ε+0.96476)=-233.834 + 459.342/(0.96476 + ε)

The sign of enthalpy variation (ΔH) between α- and γ-indomethacin characterizes an

endothermic (positive) or exothermic (negative) polymorphic transformation. Hence, from equations

(2) and (3), the polymorphic transformation from α-indomethacin to γ-indomethacin is observed to be

exothermic for all positive values of the permittivity. As an exceptional case, there is no heat

7

exchange if Hα=Hγ. The transformation is endothermic if the relative permittivity assumes negative

values, which is the case of metamaterials [37-41]. In nanotechnology, negative permittivity values

are found in polyaniline–metal oxide (carbon nanotube) composites and in poly(vinylidene

fluoride)/Ni [(CH2CF2)n/Ni] chain composite films [37]. Mechanisms of formation of negative

dielectric properties, which can be applied to drug encapsulation, are also present in the literature [38

- 41].

The polar solvents employed in the energy computation SCRF=PCM are depicted, and the

respective permittivity value of each solvent is shown in parentheses: 1-bromooctane (5.0244), aniline

(6.8882), pentanal (10.0), 1-pentanol (15.13), 1-propanol (20.524), ethanol (24.852), 1-benzonitrile

(25.592), methanol (32.613), acetonitrile (35.688), 1,2-ethanediol (40.245), and water (78.3553).

The spontaneity of the phase transformation can be determined as a function of the Gibbs free

energy variation, as described by Figure 3 [29,33].

Figure 3: Gibbs free energy function versus the relative permittivity at the B3LYP/3-21G/PCM level.

A polymorphic transformation is spontaneous if ΔG < 0 [9], which also gives the direction of

transition from α → γ,

i.e., establishing that

the transformation from α- to γ-indomethacin is

spontaneous for all positive values of the permittivity. The transformation reaches equilibrium if ΔG

is close to zero, and according to Figure 3, this equilibrium state is reached if the relative permittivity

8

is close to 1 [29,33]. In addition, for some negative values of permittivity, the transformation is

reversed, meaning that the transition for the more bioavailable polymorph is favorable [37].

Influence of the Entropy

The last thermodynamic function analyzed is the entropy, which provides information about the

reversibility of

the polymorphic transformation and measures the degree of disorder of

the

corresponding compound, whose values for both indomethacin forms are computed based on the

enthalpy H(D;ε,P0,T0,N) and Gibbs free energy G(D;ε,P0,T0,N) by means of the standard expression

S(D;ε,P0,T0,N) = (H G)/T, as outlined in Figure 4. From the second thermodynamic law, the

transformation is reversible only if ΔS=0; otherwise, the process is irreversible. Moreover, the entropy

of the whole system always increases [29,42]. Hence, the decrease in the entropy of indomethacin

results in an increase in the entropy of the solvent counterpart. The change in the sign of ΔS emerges

by means of a discontinuity and occurs at ε ≈ 11.46.

This discontinuity in the entropy characterizes a phase transition driven by the permittivity of the

In addition, the standard relationship between the enthalpy and entropy variations, ΔG=ΔH-TΔS,

which can also be visualized in Figure 1, is constant [43], revealing that a phase transition occurs

spontaneously for all temperatures in the solvent with a dielectric constant below ε≈11.5. On the other

hand, if the same conditions were considered for solvents with a dielectric constant above ε≈11.5, a

very high temperature allows a spontaneous transformation in the opposite direction,

from

γ-indomethacin to α-indomethacin. In fact, spontaneous transformation can also be achieved by

microwave excitation of the hydrogen bonds between molecules, which would be broken, inducing a

phase transition [8].

Permittivity is the order parameter that dominates the polymorphic transformations, although

pressure should be considered as well. In this case, crystallization occurs at high pressure, and new

polymorphs may arise with a higher degree of symmetry and hence less disorder [44]. From another

point of view, the same process occurs if the temperature is decreased [45]. Note that γ-indomethacin

is in the space group P-1, thus having a higher degree of symmetry than the α-structure and the

smallest disorder as a result [44]. Therefore, γ-indomethacin is produced from α-indomethacin if the

pressure increases through dry milling [9,10,45]. For this reason,

it

is speculated that under

high-pressure, γ-indomethacin immersed in solvents whose relative permittivity is greater than 12

transforms into α-indomethacin [9,44]. Note that the reversibility aspect of the transformation comes

from the difference in the entropy ΔS=Sγ-Sα. The entropy of indomethacin decreases in the

polymorphic transformation from α- to γ-indomethacin for relative permittivity values greater than

11.46.

As seen from Diagram 1, the spontaneity of a transformation depends on the difference between

Next, indomethacin treated in different solvents shows diverse values of ΔG as a result of the medium

where [α] and [γ] denote the molarity of α- and γ-indomethacin, respectively. Then, the sign of ΔG

determines which polymorph is the most abundant and its proportion. The molarity of γ-indomethacin

is greater than that of α-indomethacin if ΔG < 0. Therefore, α-indomethacin can be more abundant

than γ-indomethacin in solvents with negative permittivity values. In terms of bioavailability, Figure 3

shows that the molar ratio [α]/[γ] is higher for positive permittivity values, which in turn are close to

the vacuum permittivity. The solvation energies can also be assigned as a function of permittivity, as

follows.

The current analysis allows the generalization of the Born equation, as shown in equation (11)

[46,33].

where β is an experimental constant [31]. The enthalpy, Gibbs free energy and solvation heat can be

(11)

generalized as follows [33]:

P=Pi+c(ε-εi)-1

(12)

where Pi, εi and c are the experimental constants. The behavior of the thermodynamic function P near

a phase transition is characterized by the critical exponent -1. Hence, P can be expanded around the

value ε=0, and for very large ε, it is given by the following:

P=Pi+c[-(1/εi)-(ε/εi

2)-(ε2/εi

3)+O(ε3)]

P=Pi+c[(1/ε)+(εi/ε2)+(εi

(13a)

(13b)

Equations (12) and (13) were derived from ab initio and first-order computations of a thermodynamic

function involving an electric field D medium, in which a term due to the electric energy stored in the

dielectric medium of the solvent is incorporated into the thermodynamic structure. The Gibbs free

energy is shown by the following:

G = U - TS + PV = μN + D2/8πε

(14)

13

Other thermodynamic functions thus come similarly [11].

CONCLUSIONS

The present study focuses on the thermodynamic behavior of polymorphic phase transitions

between the α and γ phases of indomethacin induced by different polar solvents and in terms of their

permittivity. Hence, the enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, entropy and solvation Gibbs free energy were

computed at 298.15 K in a nucleation process for various permittivity values of the solvents.

The validation of the DFT method was established by matching the α and γ critical transition

temperature at the standard value of 807.45 K, followed by the systematic study of the main direction

of the polymorphic transformation, α→γ or γ →α, by the variation of the permittivity. The main

results provide insights regarding the mechanisms of drug bioavailability and are summarized as

follows:

 The enthalpy shows exothermic transformations from α- to γ-indomethacin for each positive

value of the permittivity. However, for some negative values of permittivity, characterized by

metamaterials [36], the transformation from α to γ is endothermic;

 The Gibbs free energy analysis guarantees the spontaneous transformation from α-

to

γ-indomethacin and, consequently, a higher concentration of γ-indomethacin for all positive

permittivity values. However, for values of ε close to vacuum permittivity, indomethacin presents

the highest concentration of α-indomethacin among the positive permittivity values. Moreover,

for negative permittivity [37], γ- indomethacin spontaneously transforms into α-indomethacin;

 Due to the discontinuity (∂S/∂ε)|ε- ≠ (∂S/∂ε)|ε+, wherein the subscript signs - and + indicate the left

and right limits of ε, respectively, there is a first-order phase transition of the entropy at ε = 11.46.

For ε < 11.46, the γ-indomethacin phase is more disordered; otherwise, α-indomethacin is more

disordered when ε > 11.46.
