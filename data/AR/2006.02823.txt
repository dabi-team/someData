Will 37Ar emissions from light water power reactors become
an obstacle to its use for nuclear explosion monitoring?

ABSTRACT

37Ar is a promising candidate for complementing radioxenon isotopes as indicators of
underground nuclear explosions. This study evaluates its potential anthropogenic back-
ground caused by emissions from commercial pressurised water reactors. Various 37Ar
production pathways, which result from activation of 36Ar and of 40Ca, respectively, are
identiﬁed and their emissions quantiﬁed.
In-core processes include (1) the restart of
operation and degassing of the primary cooling water after maintenance and refueling
shutdown, (2) the replacement of primary coolant water for limiting its tritium concen-
trations, and (3) the leakage of 37Ar produced from calcium impurities in UO2 after fuel
rod failures. Activation of air and of calcium in concrete within the biological shield are
major out-of-core production pathways. Whereas emissions from in-core processes are
transient, a rather constant 37Ar source term results from its out-of-core production.

Generic atmospheric dispersion simulations indicate that already at moderate distances
from the emitter, concentrations of 37Ar caused by routine reactor operations are far below
its cosmogenic background in air. The only exception results from an inadvertent reactor
re-start without operation of the primary cooling water degassing system for prolonged
time. Such an event also causes high emissions of 41Ar which can be used for discrimi-
nating its 37Ar signal from an underground nuclear explosion.

1. INTRODUCTION

The detection of radioisotopes created by nuclear explosions is a key component of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) veriﬁcation regime. For underground
explosions the focus is on radioxenon due to its chemical inertness, high ﬁssion yield and
its potential for discriminating radioxenon, which originates from a nuclear explosion,
from reactor emissions if the four principal Xe radioisotopes are detected in atmospheric
samples (Kalinowski and Pistner, 2006). However, intensiﬁed xenon monitoring by the
International Monitoring System (IMS) of CTBT revealed that atmospheric emissions
of radiopharmaceutical production facilities may create radioxenon signals with isotope
ratios indistinguishable from those of nuclear explosions (Saey, 2009). Thus, including
additional radionuclides might increase the sensitivity of the noble gas monitoring for
CTBT veriﬁcation. A promising candidate is 37Ar which is produced by activation of
calcium during underground nuclear explosions and with a half-life of 35 days is still
present in case of delayed emission into the atmosphere when much of the radioxenon
has been decayed (Carrigan et al., 1996; Haas et al., 2010). Measurements of 37Ar are
envisaged for CTBT on-site inspections (Aalseth et al., 2011), but the anthropogenic
background of 37Ar, its major sources and their potential impact on nuclear explosion
monitoring need to be assessed, before an extension of the IMS noble gas monitoring
network should be recommended. However, this information is not readily available, as
37Ar atmospheric releases of nuclear facilities are not monitored. For argon, such data
is available only for its short-lived isotope 41Ar (half-live 1.83 hours), which in nuclear
reactors originates from the activation of 40Ar, the main natural argon isotope. Recently,
37Ar emissions have been measured at a research reactor (Johnson et al., 2017), but there
is no information available for commercial nuclear power reactors.

This study evaluates the production rates and release pathways of 37Ar in pressurised
water reactors (PWR), which constitute about 66 % of the operational nuclear power
reactors (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2019). Measurements of 37Ar in reactor
emissions, which have been performed for validating these evaluations, are presented
elsewhere (Purtschert et al., in preparation).

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Reactor

All assessments are performed for the latest 1300 MWe class of PWR reactors built by
the German manufacturer Kraftwerk Union (KWU) which are still operating in Germany.
They use UO2 fuel with maximum burnup of 50 MWd per kg of heavy metal (HM). If

not noted otherwise, the design information required for our analyses was taken from
technical documents made available to the public during their licensing procedures. Even
if the detailed design of modern PWR reactors built by other manufacturers may show
some diﬀerences, the key results of this study are expected to apply for these also.

2.2 In core 37Ar production pathways

2.2.1 Pathway (1): Activation of argon in cooling water

During each refueling and maintenance shutdown, the reactor vessel is removed and the
primary cooling loop is connected to the water-ﬁlled cooling pond inside the reactor
building. Because these outages usually continue for some weeks, the concentration of air
dissolved in the cooling water approaches equilibrium. For restart, the primary cooling
loop is isolated and within approximately 1 day the power is increased stepwise to its
nominal level (Fig. 1). When passing the reactor core, the argon dissolved in the primary
cooling water becomes activated with 37Ar. It is produced by neutron capture of 36Ar,
which is a natural argon isotope with 0.337 % abundance. However, concentrations of
dissolved gases and thus 37Ar production rates are eﬃciently reduced by the coolant
puriﬁcation system, which includes a vacuum evaporator for coolant degassing. In the
KWU reactors, this system operates with a puriﬁcation rate Lp of 0.09 h−1 which may be
doubled if necessary.

Thus, the dynamics of the numbers of 37Ar atoms, N c

The highest 37Ar emissions from this pathway will occur if after a refueling shutdown
the reactor is restarted, but the degassing system is started inadvertently only after some
period of full power operation.

Routinely, a small fraction (typically some m3 d−1) of primary cooling water is replaced
and after puriﬁcation, degassing and interim storage is discharged to avoid the accumu-
lation of tritium. The makeup water is degassed before entering the cooling system. This
process causes some accumulation of radioargon within the primary cooling system, as
after the restart phase degassing is limited to the water fraction to be discharged.
If
we assume that (i) 10 m3 of primary coolant are replaced daily, (ii) this exchange is a
continuous process, and (iii) degassing reduces stable argon concentrations of the makeup
water by 103, the accumulation of 37Ar in the coolant is given as

2.2.2 Pathway (2): Activation of calcium in fuel

Due to its production process, UO2 fuel shows minor calcium impurities with a mean value
of 5 ppm (Andreas Schnieder, Framatome Advanced Nuclear Fuels, Personal communica-
tion). During irradiation, 37Ar is produced within the fuel matrix via the 40Ca (n,α) 37Ar
reaction. A fraction of this diﬀuses to the grain boundaries, into pores within or between
grains and within connected pores into the fuel-cladding gap and gas plenum of the fuel
rod (Rest et al., 2019). In the event of a fuel rod failure these gaseous radionuclides may
be released into the primary cooling system. Since in a PWR such a failure today has
a probability of about 10−4 per rod (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2010), it is
assumed that a single fuel rod will develop a leak at high burnup when it shows high
ﬁssion gas concentrations in the fuel-cladding gap.

For KWU fuel measurements have shown, that for operation regimes without major tran-
sients at 50 MWd (kg HM)−1 burnup up to 10 % of the ﬁssion gases have accumulated
in the fuel-cladding gap and ﬁssion gas plenum (Hering, 1983; Manzel and Walker, 2002).
In this gas, a fraction pg of 0.36 % of the 37Ar fuel rod inventory will be present, if it is
assumed that (i) the fuel release rate f1 is time-invariant giving a value of about 9 · 10−10
s−1, that (ii) argon behaves similar to the major ﬁssion gases krypton and xenon, and if

4

(iii) the decay of 37Ar is taken into account. If a rod defect occurs, this radioargon can
escape from the gap into the cooling water. Following Lewis et al. (2017), a gap escape
rate f2 of 2 · 10−5 s−1 is a typical value for a large defect of a PWR fuel rod.
If a fuel rod defect develops at high burnup at time t0, the numbers of 37Ar nuclei present
in the fuel-cladding gap and the gas plenum of the aﬀected rod, N g
37(t), and in the primary
cooling water, N c

(cid:21)

After a power transient, notably for reactor shutdown, enhanced releases of volatile ﬁssion
products from defect fuel rods into the cooling water are observed (Lewis et al., 1997).
For assessing the 37Ar emissions following such an event, it is assumed that a defect had
developed at the top of the fuel rod shortly before reactor shutdown, which causes a spike
release of the inventory of the gas plenum. The 37Ar present in the primary cooling system
after such an event can be estimated as

2.3 Out of core 37Ar production pathways

2.3.1 Pathway (3): Activation of air

The reactor pressure vessel is enclosed by a massive concrete casing, the biological shield

production of 37Ar by activation of the natural 36Ar isotope in both cavities. Since the
outer cavity is used for cooling the concrete, it is part of a separated exhaust air system,
which includes the rooms with contaminated air. It has a total volume of 104 m3 with an

5

air exchange rate Lo of 10 % h−1 via ﬁlters into the main air exhaust system. The inner
cavity of the biological shield is isolated, but shows a leak rate of 1 m3 h−1 into the outer
cavity corresponding to an exchange rate Li of 0.625 % h−1.

Since the neutron ﬂux density does not vary radially within the cavities (see Fig. 6 below),
37Ar production rates are given as

are attained after about 12 days for the ventilation rates speciﬁed above.

2.3.2 Pathway (4): Activation of calcium in concrete

The residual neutron ﬂux produces 37Ar within the concrete of the biological shield via
the 40Ca (n,α) 37Ar reaction. The calcium content of concrete may vary widely between
about 8.7 %, if granite is used as aggregate, and 37.5 % in case of limestone as aggregate
(Gernot Kirchner, LafargeHolzim, Personal communication). The ﬂux density, j37, of the
radioargon fraction, which enters the cavities of the biological shield, can be calculated
by Fick’s law as

j37(rs, t) = −(cid:15) · Deﬀ ·

∂ C37(r, t)
∂ r

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(16)

where r denotes the radial distance from the outer edge of the reactor core, rs is the
cavity/concrete interface position, (cid:15) its porosity, Deﬀ denotes the 37Ar diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient within the concrete and C37(r, t) the concentration of 37Ar produced via calcium
activation. A generic value of the porosity (cid:15) of concrete is 2 % (Gernot Kirchner, Lafarge-
Holzim, Personal communication). The eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient Deﬀ of a substance
in a porous medium can be linked with its free molecular diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dm by

· Dm ,

(17)

Deﬀ =

(cid:15)
τ

6

where τ denotes the tortuosity of the pore space. It can be approximated by τ = (cid:15)−1
(Shen and Chen, 2007). At standard conditions, Dm of argon in air has a value of
1.89 · 10−5 m2 s−1. With these data, the diﬀusion length

(cid:96)37 =

(cid:113)

Deﬀ · λ−1
37

(18)

of 37Ar in the concrete of the biological shield becomes 18.2 cm.

After about 100 days of operation at rated power, 37Ar has attained its equilibrium
concentration, C eq
37(r), and eq. (16) gives a time-independent upper limit of its emissions
from this pathway. Then, the radioargon concentration gradient in eq. (16) is given by
the diﬀusion equation as

(20)

In eq. (20), N40, σn,α
40 denote the volumetric atom density of 40Ca in the concrete and
its activation cross section, respectively. Since no data are available for the emanation
fraction of argon, the value of 0.11 ± 0.02 for the noble gas radon (Sahoo et al., 2011) has
been adopted.

For evaluating eqs. (16), (19), the initial condition is set to C37(r, 0) = 0. The following
two cases are considered.

Case 1: Slab of thickness 2 H
If H (cid:47) (cid:96)37, the 37Ar proﬁle within the slab is inﬂuenced by its diﬀusion through both
surfaces. For a spatially constant production rate P37 within the slab and the boundary
conditions C37(±H) = 0, we get (Sahoo et al., 2011)

(21)

Case 2: Semi-inﬁnite slab
If H (cid:39) (cid:96)37, eq. (18) approaches the well-known solution for a semi-inﬁnite slab (e.g. D¨orr
and M¨unnich, 1990)

jeq
37 (±H) = f · P37 · (cid:96)37

.

(22)

Fluxes of 37Ar into the cavities are obtained by multiplying eq. (21), (22) by the respective
surface areas of the concrete’s activated zone,which are derived from their radial distances
from the center of the core (see Fig. 6) and the active length of the fuel elements of 3.9
m.

2.4 Noble gas retention systems and emission

7

The air removed from the coolant water degassing system and the biological shield area
passes a noble gas retention system before being diluted by non-contaminated air at a
rate of 166,000 m3 h−1 and emitted into the atmosphere. Data are not available on the
system’s retention times for argon, but using its value of 60 h for krypton and the argon
to krypton ratios of activated carbon published (Bazan et al., 2011) and measured by our-
selves (Heise, 2019) indicate argon retention times less than 24 hours. In the following,
these are always set to 12 hours.

2.5 Neutronic reactor simulations

For the in-core pathways, production rates and fuel inventories of 37Ar were calculated
using the TRITON sequence (DeHart and Bowman, 2011) of the SCALE code system
(Rearden and Jessee, 2016). Assuming vertically constant neutron ﬂux densities over the
active length of the fuel elements (3.9 m), their values along the radial cross section de-
picted in Fig. 2 were estimated using the 1-D discrete ordinates code XSDRN of SCALE.
All simulations employed the ENDF/B-VII nuclear data libraries of SCALE (Ilas et al.,
2012).

2.6 Atmospheric dispersion

Transport and dilution of the calculated 37Ar emissions within the atmosphere were es-
timated for checking, whether pressurized water reactors may adversely aﬀect the de-
tectability of radioargon signals originating from nuclear weapon testing. This was per-
formed with the generic dilution factors derived by Eslinger et al. (2015) for long distance
(100 - 3.000 km) transport of noble gases. These were derived from an ensemble of 3650
simulations, which employed a Lagrangian model for calculating the optimum detector
position in space and time if a 1 hour release was assumed at 10 release locations (both
on the northern and southern hemisphere) and meteorological data for each day of the
year 2011 (Eslinger et al., 2015). For routine emissions, these dilution factors may under-
estimate concentrations, as they do not take the superposition of consecutive 1 h release
puﬀs into account. We considered this by using the upper 90 % bound of the dilution
factors given by Eslinger et al. (2015) instead of their median. For the peak emissions
considered in this study, their highest 24 h mean has been assumed as source term in
order to take a 24 h sampling time into account for the 37Ar analyses.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, estimated emission rates are presented individually for each of the four
potential pathways identiﬁed, followed by an evaluation of total emissions comparing our
results to measurements and taking into account atmospheric transport and dilution.

3.1 Pathway (1): Activation of argon in cooling water

Estimated atmospheric emissions of 37Ar with time after the primary cooling pumps and
the degassing system(s) are activated during the reactor restart operations are shown in
Fig. 3. Due to the time required for the reactor to become critical and to increase its
power level (see Fig. 1) emissions start to rise after ca. 1 day, reach a maximum speedily

8

and decline to close to zero within 5 days. This dynamics reﬂects that the increase of
37Ar production rates with power become exceeded by the fast and eﬀective reduction of
its precursor 36Ar caused by the coolant water degassing. This eﬀect is also documented
by the decrease of peak emissions by almost an order of magnitude if the second system
is operating as well.

Usually after a refueling shutdown there are physics tests for checking that the neutronic
operation characteristics of the modiﬁed core is as predicted and in accordance with the
safety limits. These will cause a delay in increasing the power level, which due to the
degassing will result in smaller 37Ar production rates compared to those shown in Fig.
3. Thus, our results represent a conservative estimate of potential 37Ar emissions by this
pathway.

If the reactor is restarted inadvertantly without any of the degassing system operating,
the produced 37Ar will accumulate within the primary cooling system. Its emissions after
both systems are activated are shown in Fig. 4 for various prior operation times. After
the 12 hour delay caused by the noble gas retention systems of the plant, there is a peak
emission of 37Ar. Due to the eﬀective removal of all argon isotopes by the degassing
systems emissions drop oﬀ eﬀectively within two days, reﬂecting the degassing systems’
removal rate. For short times after restart peak values increase linearly with the accumu-
lation period, but with increasing time they level oﬀ due to the 37.5 day half-life of 37Ar.

Replacing 10 m3 d−1 of the primary cooling water for limiting its tritium concentrations
results in an 37Ar atmospheric emission of 14.1 Bq m−3 at equilibrium due to activitation
of the residual 36Ar present in the degassed makeup water.

3.2 Pathway (2): Activation of calcium in fuel

If a major defect of one fuel rod present in the core develops after its 37Ar inventory has
attained equilibrium, estimated emission rates both during rated power operation and
caused by a shutdown transient are shown in Fig. 5. Although marked peaks are appar-
ent from release of the 37Ar accumulated in the fuel rod gap and plenum, both when the
defect develops and after a power transient, their concentrations in stack emissions are
negligibly small and do not produce any detectable 37Ar background within the atmo-
sphere. This is a marked diﬀerence from xenon emissions of nuclear power reactors, which
for its major radioactive isotope 133Xe mainly result from fuel rod defects (Lewis et al,
1997), notably after reactor shutdown when the noble gas retention systems are bypassed
(Saey et al., 2013). This discrepancy results from the fact that the concentration of cal-
cium as the precursor of 37Ar in the fuel is limited to trace levels (5 ppm) producing a
small equilibrium activity of 1.7 · 106 Bq kg−1 compared to the high yield ﬁssion product
133Xe with an equilibrium inventory of 8.3 · 1013 Bq kg−1.

3.3 Out-of-core neutron ﬂux densities

For estimating out-of-core radioargon production rates, knowledge of the residual neutron
ﬂux densities and energy distributions within the biological shield is required. Results are
depicted in Fig. 6 along the active fuel zone for rated power operation (see Fig. 2). For
clarity, the original 238 energy group ﬂux densities used for all neutronic calculations are

9

collapsed into three broad group cross sections which represent thermal, epithermal and
fast neutron energies. The total neutron ﬂux densities at the outer surface of the reactor
pressure vessel are still above 109 cm−2 s−1, but are eﬀectively moderated and absorbed
by the two concrete sections of the biological shield. These results indicate that 37Ar
production by activation of argon in the cavities and of calcium in the concrete of the
biological shield are of potential signiﬁcance.

3.4 Pathway (3): Activation of air in the biological shield

At rated power, 37Ar production rates in the cavities of the biological shield are time-
invariant. Contrary to the two in-core pathways considered previously, emissions of this
radioisotope originating from these cavities are almost constant after it has attained its
equilibrium concentration ca. 12 days after the reactor commenced operation at constant
power.

Fig. 7 depicts the 37Ar production rates within the two cavities due to activation of
natural 36Ar within the neutron ﬁeld of the active zone of the reactor core, which were
calculated using the neutron ﬂux densities shown in Fig. 6. As expected they follow the
radial neutron ﬂux density levels. With the air volumes present within the neutron ﬂux
ﬁeld and the ventilation rates the 37Ar equilibrium concentrations given in Table 1 evolve.
In the outer cavity these are almost three orders of magnitude lower than in the inner one,
which reﬂects both the smaller neutron ﬂux densities and the large dilution volume of the
contaminated air ventilation and exhaust system. Only 6.1 % of this activity is produced
by activation of the 36Ar being present in the outer cavity, the remainder originates from
leakage from the inner into the outer cavity.

3.5 Pathway (4): Activation of calcium in concrete

Production rates of 37Ar within the biological shield at rated power are included in Fig.
7 both for low and high Ca concrete. As these are almost constant within the ﬁrst 10 cm
of the inner cavity’s concrete wall, their averages have been used with eqn. (21) for calcu-
lating radioargon diﬀusion ﬂuxes into the inner cavity across the surface of the activation
zone for both concrete types.

Production rates within the 37Ar diﬀusion length in the concrete walls of the outer cavity
decrease with distance from the core (Fig. 7). As to our best knowledge no analytical
solution of eqn. (19) is available for such a production rate proﬁle, we approximated these
by their mean value within the outer 20 cm of concrete. Using eqn. (22) and neglecting
the small contributions from 37Ar being produced in the outer concrete wall, its rated
power equilibrium concentrations caused by this pathway in the outer cavity are given in
Table 1.

Activity concentrations built up by this pathway are more than three orders of magni-
tude higher in the inner than in the outer cavity. This again reﬂects the radial decrease
of neutron ﬂux and the higher dilution volume of the contaminated air ventilation system
of the outer cavity. As for the activation of 36Ar in air, most of the 37Ar accumulating in
the outer cavity originates from the inner cavity. As Table 1 reveals, contributions by the
out-of-core nuclear pathways are in the same order of magnitude, their ratios depending

10

on the calcium content of the concrete.

3.6 Ratios of 41Ar to 37Ar

In most countries, stack emissions of 41Ar are continuously monitored. Thus, it would be
attractive if the emitted air shows an almost constant 41Ar:37Ar activity ratio, from which
the unknown 37Ar emissions could be easily deduced (Fay and Biegalski, 2013; Johnson
et al., 2017). However, our simulations indicate that for pressurized water reactors such
a constant ratio can not be expected. First, 41Ar originating from in-core production
pathways (i.e. pathway (1) above) will pass the stack noble gas retention systems and
because of its short half-life (1.83 h) will largely decay before being emitted. Second,
41Ar built up by activation of air within the cavities of the biological shield will closely
follow routine short-term variations of reactor power and of the contaminated air exhaust
system operation mode.

3.7 Emissions and atmospheric concentrations

The in-core argon activation pathways evaluated above result in transient peak emissions,
whereas the out-of-core pathways cause quite constant 37Ar emissions. Their estimated
concentrations are given in Table 2, which result from taking the dilution of the outer cav-
ity air by uncontaminated air from the reactor building into account. It should be noted
that these data may slightly overestimate actual emissions, as they assume that after an
extended period of rated power operation 37Ar concentrations have reached equilibrium.
For comparison, Table 2 includes activity concentrations measured in the emissions of
the German nuclear power plant Philippsburg-2 taken in December 2016 and September
2017 (Purtschert et al., in preparation), which are in good to excellent agreement with
our predictions.

Anthropogenic atmospheric concentrations of 37Ar calculated from routine emissions are
shown in Fig. 8 for its various production pathways. Even at short distances from the
emitting reactor, their concentrations become by several orders of magnitude smaller than
the range of cosmogenic background concentrations speciﬁed by Riedmann and Purtschert
(2011), which have been measured in air in Bern (Switzerland) during the last decades.

In Fig. 9 the 37Ar concentrations in air are shown, which result from our calculated peak
24 h emissions after a restart following a reactor shutdown and contact of the primary
cooling water with air. At distances of more than 100 km from the emitter, cosmogenic
concentrations of 37Ar in the atmosphere will be exceeded only if the reactor’s puriﬁcation
and degassing system is not operating for a prolonged period of time, allowing 37Ar to ac-
cumulate, and is switched on afterwards. However, such an operation mode constitutes a
signiﬁcant violation of the operation regulations and thus will occur rather infrequently. It
will also cause elevated emissions of 41Ar accumulated in the primary cooling water. This
short-lived isotope attains its saturation concentration within a few hours with maximum
24 h mean emissions of 6 · 108 Bq m−3 after the puriﬁcation system is started. These are
by several orders of magnitude higher than the 37Ar emissions caused by such an event
and thus provide a convenient option for discriminating such transient signals from 37Ar
emitted after underground nuclear explosions.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We have evaluated the pathways and atmospheric source terms of 37Ar in pressurised
water reactors, as these constitute the by far most frequent commercial nuclear reactor
type. It is produced via 36Ar (n,γ) 37Ar and 40Ca (n,α) 37Ar reactions both in and out of
the reactor core.

In core, 37Ar emissions originate from activation of 36Ar at reactor restart after shutdown
events with access of the primary coolant to air, in case of fuel rod defects from activa-
tion of calcium impurities of the uranium oxide, and from activation of residual 36Ar in
makeup water during routine operation. The ﬁrst two processes result in transient 37Ar
source terms. The 37Ar signal caused by a fuel rod defect is negligible. After reactor
restart, 37Ar concentrations in air become small compared to its cosmogenic background
already at distances well below 100 km from the emitting plant. This becomes diﬀerent, if
after reactor restart its primary cooling water degassing system is switched on only after
prolonged operation time. However, such an event also causes high emissions of 41Ar,
which can be used to distinguish it from 37Ar originating from an underground nuclear
explosion. Emissions caused by the third in core production process are almost constant,
but small and become negligible at distances well below 100 km from the plant.

Out of core, 37Ar results from activation of 36Ar in air and of 40Ca in concrete of the bio-
logical shield. Emissions due to these processes are almost constant, but small and below
cosmogenic levels of 37Ar at distances well below 100 km from the plant. Our calculated
source terms agree well with 37Ar measured in samples taken at the stack of a pressurised
water reactor (Purtschert et al., in preparation).

In summary, our study underlines the attractiveness of 37Ar as a potential indicator of
underground nuclear explosions for complementing the radioxenon isotopes of the Com-
prehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) veriﬁcation regime.
