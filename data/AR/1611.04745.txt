Abstract. The main physics goals of the NA61/SHINE programme on strong interactions
are the study of the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement and the search for signatures
of the critical point of strongly interacting matter. For this purpose a scan of the two
dimensional phase diagram (T -µB) is being performed at the SPS by measurements of
hadron production in nucleus-nucleus collisions as a function of collision energy and
system size.
This contribution presents intriguing results on the energy dependence of hadron spec-
tra and yields in inelastic p+p and centrality selected Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions. In
particular, the energy dependence of the signals of deconﬁnement, the "horn", "step" and
"kink", and new results on ﬂuctuations and correlations are shown and compared with the
corresponding data of other experiments and model predictions.

1 Introduction
NA61/SHINE [1] is a ﬁxed target experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) of the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The layout of the NA61/SHINE detector is sketched in
Fig. 1. It consists of a large acceptance hadron spectrometer with excellent capabilities in charged par-
ticle momentum measurements and identiﬁcation by a set of ﬁve Time Projection Chambers as well
as Time-of-Flight detectors. The geometrical layout of the TPCs allows particle detection down to
pT = 0 GeV/c in a broad interval of the forward rapidity semisphere, which is practically impossible
at collider experiments. The high resolution, modular forward calorimeter, the Projectile Spectator
Detector, measures forward going energy EF, which in nucleus-nucleus reactions is primarily a mea-
sure of the number of spectator (non-interacted) nucleons and thus related to the centrality of the
collision.

The main goal of the strong interaction programme of the experiment is to discover the Critical
Point (CP) [2] of strongly interacting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement
(OD) [3, 4]. To achieve this goal a two-dimensional phase diagram scan - energy versus system
size - is being performed by NA61/SHINE. Both primary and secondary beams are available to the
experiment, allowing measurements of hadron production in collisions of protons and various nuclei
(p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La) at a range of beam momenta (13A - 158A GeV/c). Figure 2 shows for
which systems and energies data has already been collected (green), is scheduled for recording (red)
or is planned (gray). This scan allows to probe diﬀerent values of temperature T and baryochemical
potential µB of the strongly interacting matter at the freeze-out stage [5].

2 Spectra and yields: studying the properties of the onset of

deconﬁnement

One of the main signals of the onset of deconﬁnement are the kink, horn, and step [3] struc-
tures observed in Pb+Pb collisions by the NA49 collaboration. Analysis of spectra and yields by
NA61/SHINE allows to check whether these structures are present also in collisions of small and
intermediate mass nuclei. Recent measurements of Argon on Scandium collisions are an important
step in this program. Figure 3 shows the spectra of π− from strong and electromagnetic processes
in Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c obtained with the h− analysis method [6]. The fact that approxi-
mately 90% of negatively charged hadrons produced in the SPS energy range are π− mesons is at the
core of this method. Correction for contribution from other negatively charged particles is done using
Monte Carlo simulations based on the EPOS 1.99 model [7] together with the GEANT-3.2 code for
particle transport and detector simulation.

Rapidity spectra (see Fig. 3, middle) were ﬁtted to obtain 4π mean multiplicities of π− mesons [9].
As the measurements via the h− analysis method are possible only for π− mesons, the multiplicities
of π+ and π0 mesons were approximated by (cid:104)π(cid:105)p+p = 3(cid:104)π−(cid:105)p+p + 1 and (cid:104)π(cid:105)A+A = 3(cid:104)π−(cid:105)A+A. In order to
compare matter created in the collisions of diﬀerent nuclei the mean pion multiplicity (cid:104)π(cid:105) is divided
by the mean number of wounded nucleons (cid:104)W(cid:105) corresponding to the given class of collision centrality.
This quantity was obtained using the Monte Carlo model - Glissando 2.73 [10]. Figure 4 shows the

kink plot, where the (cid:104)π(cid:105) multiplicity, normalized to (cid:104)W(cid:105), increases faster with F =
in
the SPS energy range for central Pb+Pb collisions than in p+p interactions. This behaviour violates the
prediction of the Wounded Nucleon Model [11] (cid:104)π(cid:105)A+A/(cid:104)W(cid:105) = (cid:104)π(cid:105)p+p/2, but is successfully explained
by the entropy increase due to formation of quark-gluon plasma in the Statistical Model of the Early
Stage (SMES) [12]. The new results obtained for central Ar+Sc collisions follow the Pb+Pb trend for
high SPS energies and are close to the p+p results for low SPS energies whereas the new results for
Be+Be show the opposite tendency. One should mention that the mean number of wounded nucleons
(cid:104)W(cid:105) is a model-dependent quantity, leading to uncertainties when comparing results obtained for
diﬀerent systems.

collisions from NA61/SHINE and for world data on p+p and central A+A collisions [13, 14].

The NA49 collaboration observed a plateau (step) in the inverse slope parameter (T ) of transverse
mass (mT ) spectra of kaons for Pb+Pb collisions as expected from the SMES model for constant
temperature and pressure in a mixed phase. The recent NA61/SHINE results [15], presented in Fig. 5,

show that even in p+p collisions the energy dependence of T for kaons (identiﬁed using the dE/dx
method) exhibits a rapid change in the SPS energy range.

inelastic p+p interactions measured by the NA61/SHINE experiment (full blue circles) and other experiments
(open blue circles) and central Au+Au and Pb+Pb interactions. Blue band represents the systematic uncertainty.

Moreover, sharp peaks in the energy dependence of the ratios K+/π+ and Λ/π were found for
Pb+Pb collisions by the NA49 collaboration. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the new measurements
by NA61/SHINE for inelastic p+p interactions with the world data. Candidates of charged decays of
Lambda hyperons were identiﬁed by the standard topological cuts applied to pairs of positively and
negatively charged particles detected by the TPCs [16, 17]. One observes that even in p+p interactions
the K+/π+ ratio exhibits rapid changes with energy whereas new measurements of the Λ/π ratio were
done only for two energies and do not give a clear picture of the energy dependence.

the NA61/SHINE experiment (full blue circles) and world data on p+p and central A+A collisions. Blue band

3 Fluctuation observables: search for the critical point

The strategy of looking for the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter is based on the ex-
pectation that the correlation length ξ diverges at the CP. This divergence may lead to the growth
of ﬂuctuations for diﬀerent observables such as multiplicity, net charge etc. Therefore, one can ex-
pect that a scan over freezeout points close to the CP will show non-monotonic behavior of these
ﬂuctuation observables.

This search is complicated by the fact that the size of the system created in collisions of two
nuclei changes signiﬁcantly from event to event. Observables can be classiﬁed according to their
dependence on this volume and its ﬂuctuations: 1) extensive quantity - proportional to the system
volume in the Grand Canonical Ensemble or the number of the wounded nucleons in the Wounded
Nucleon Model [11] 2) intensive quantity - independent of the system volume 3) strongly intensive
quantity [18] - independent of the system volume and ﬂuctuations of this volume. Strongly intensive
quantities are best suited to study ﬂuctuations in nucleus-nucleus collisions because of the unavoidable
event-to-event variations of the volume.

3.1 Scaled variance of multiplicity

The most common way to characterize the strength of ﬂuctuations of the quantity A is to determine
the variance of its distribution Var (A) which is an extensive quantity. In turn, the scaled variance
ω[A] = Var (A)

(1)

(cid:104)A(cid:105)

is intensive. Here, (cid:104)· · · (cid:105) stands for averaging over all events.

In the Wounded Nucleon Model one can get the following expression for the scaled variance of

the distribution of the multiplicity N:

ω[N] = ω∗[N] + (cid:104)N(cid:105)/(cid:104)W(cid:105) · ω[W],

(2)

where ω∗[N] is the scaled variance calculated for the ﬁxed value (cid:104)W(cid:105) (i.e. ω∗[N] = ω[N]p+p). This
leads to the following ineqality

ω[N]A+A ≥ ω[N]p+p

(3)
The recent measurements by the NA61/SHINE collaboration show that this inequality is vio-
lated [19]. Figure 7 shows the system size dependence of the scaled variance ω[N] for negatively
charged hadrons for two beam momenta - 19 and 150A GeV/c. One observes that ﬂuctuations of mul-
tiplicity in very central Ar+Sc collisions are suppressed compared to p+p interactions, in disagreement
with Eq. (3).

3.2 Joint ﬂuctuations of multiplicity and transverse momentum

In order to suppress contributions from these ’trivial’ ﬂuctuations strongly intensive observables are
used:

(cid:20)

∆[A, B] = 1
C∆

(cid:21)
(cid:104)B(cid:105)ω[A] − (cid:104)A(cid:105)ω[B]

(cid:20)

Σ[A, B] = 1

In case of joint transverse momentum PT and multiplicity N ﬂuctuations we deﬁne: A = PT =
(cid:80)N

i=1 pTi, B = N, C∆ = CΣ = (cid:104)N(cid:105)ω[pT ].

Statistical uncertainties are smaller than the symbol size. The horizontal dashed line divides the plot into WNM
exluded (below the line) and WNM allowed (above the line) zones.

The NA61/SHINE collaboration performed measurements of these two quantities for inelastic p+p
interactions, as well as Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions for the smallest 5% of forward energies [20].
Figure 8 shows ∆[PT , N] (left) and Σ[PT , N] (right) as a function of
sNN and mean number of
wounded nucleons (cid:104)W(cid:105) (from [10]). No dip-like or hill-like structures that could be related to the
critical point of strongly interacting matter are observed in these results.

3.3 Higher order moments of the net-charge distribution

The ﬂuctuation quantities analyzed in sections 3.1 and 3.2 include only ﬁrst and second moments of
the studied observables. Higher order moments of ﬂuctuations should depend more sensitively on ξ,
possibly making the signal of the CP more visible. Another reason to measure higher order moments

of the net electric charge distribution is that for conserved quantum numbers there is a possibility to
compare with susceptibilities calculated in lattice QCD [21]. The volume independent combinations
of the higher order moments are selected as

S σ =

Var(Q)

,

κσ2 =

(cid:104)Q4(cid:105)c

where (cid:104)Q3(cid:105)c and (cid:104)Q4(cid:105)c are the third and fourth order cumulants of the net charge distribution.

Figure 9 shows preliminary results on ﬂuctuations of net-charge in inelastic p+p interactions [22].
Both the scaled variance ω and S σ depend weakly on collision energy whereas κσ2 rises signiﬁ-
cantly. Measured net-charge ﬂuctuations do not agree with independent particle production (Skel-
lam distribution). The diﬀerence may come from production of multi-charged particles and quantum
statistics [23]. The EPOS 1.99 model provides a reasonably good description of the data.

4 Summary and conclusion

NA61/SHINE data taking for the system size − energy scan is well advanced: data for p+p, 7Be+9Be
and 40Ar+45Sc collisions have already been recorded. Although preliminary results on transverse mo-
mentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations and higher order moments of the net-charge distribution did not
yet give evidence of the critical point of strongly interacting matter, a number of intriguing results were
observed, such as suppression of the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution in nucleus-nucleus
collisions, as well as rapid changes in the energy dependence of the kaon inverse slope parameter T
and of the ratio (cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) in p+p interactions.
