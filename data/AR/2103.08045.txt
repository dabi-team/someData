Abstract

Although ferromagnets are found in all kinds of technological applications, only few substances are

known to be intrinsically ferromagnetic at room temperature. In the past twenty years, a plethora of new

artiﬁcial ferromagnetic materials have been found by introducing defects into non-magnetic host materials.

In contrast to the intrinsic ferromagnetic materials, they offer an outstanding degree of material engineering

freedom, provided one ﬁnds a type of defect to functionalize every possible host material to add magnetism

to its intrinsic properties. Still, one controversial question remains: Are these materials really technologi-

cally relevant ferromagnets? To answer this question, in this work the emergence of a ferromagnetic phase

upon ion irradiation is systematically investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Quantitative pre-

dictions are validated against experimental data from the literature of SiC hosts irradiated with high energy

Ne ions and own experiments on low energy Ar ion irradiation of TiO2 hosts. In the high energy regime, a

bulk magnetic phase emerges, which is limited by host lattice amorphization, whereas at low ion energies an

ultrathin magnetic layer forms at the surface and evolves into full magnetic percolation. Lowering the ion

energy, the magnetic layer thickness reduces down to a bilayer, where a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy

appears due to magnetic surface states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic materials play a major role in many spintronic and other technological applica-

tions [1] such as magnetic storage [2], logic devices [3], magnetic ﬁeld sensors and magnetic

random access memory [4–6]. Materials with strong intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) order above

room temperature, such as the transition metals Fe, Ni or Co and their alloys, are rather unusual

among the magnetic materials known today [7] and there is still the need for new functional mate-

rials with magnetic order above room temperature. In the past two decades, a method of creating

artiﬁcial ferromagnetic materials has emerged and a multitude of so-called defect-induced fer-

romagnets were reported [8–10]. Since the ﬁrst prediction of an artiﬁcial ferromagnetic material

with transition temperature above 300 K, based on Mn doped ZnO appeared twenty years ago [11],

the ﬁeld has substantially evolved. First, it was realized that doping with magnetic impurities was

not at all necessary in order to induce a robust FM order in the non-magnetic host matrix, rather

all kinds of lattice defects were at the origin of the measured magnetic signals [12–15]. This

realization promised great possibilities to construct new functional magnetic materials, as any

non-magnetic material could potentially host a certain kind of defect, turning it into an artiﬁcial

ferromagnet. The hunt was on and the result was a plethora of reports ranging from oxide, nitride,

carbon-based, 2D van der Waals and many more materials showing signals of ferromagnetism

upon introducing all kinds of defects [8–10]. One of the most promising and versatile methods for

introducing these defects is the irradiation with non-magnetic ions [16], owing to the availability

of ion sources ranging over the whole periodic table and energies from few eV to hundreds of

MeV.

Although many experiments were accompanied by theoretical studies, such as electronic struc-

ture calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), the search was mostly guided by blind

trial and error and a brute force approach.

It is therefore not very surprising that most of the

reported materials only showed very tiny magnetic signals, which soon led to debates about the

nature of the effect [17, 18] and raised the question of whether this route could eventually lead

to a robust magnetic order above room temperature, comparable with intrinsic ferromagnets. Fur-

thermore, the measurement of the magnetization of such artiﬁcial ferromagnetic samples turns out

to be quite difﬁcult due to the inherent uncertainty of the magnetic volume, leading to largely

underestimated values in the literature. Considering the enormous amount of host material candi-

dates and lattice defects, a more systematic search method and better selection criteria are highly

needed.

In this work, we present a systematic investigation of the emergence of such artiﬁcial ferro-

magnetic phases, both theoretically and experimentally. We ﬁrst propose a scheme for the com-

putational discovery of candidate materials that can be created by ion irradiation. The scheme is

based on ﬁrst principle calculations, guided by experimental constraints, automatically restricting

the potential defects to those accessible experimentally and can readily be implemented for high

throughput material discovery. We further provide a method to determine the defect distribution

created within the host lattices, allowing to obtain accurate magnetization values.

Two ion energy regimes are then investigated, namely at high energies ≥ 100 keV and at

low energies ≤ 1 keV. The main physical processes governing the emerging FM phase in these

regimes are identiﬁed and validated using high energy experimental data found in the literature

and own low energy experiments. The predictions of the scheme are compared to experimental

magnetization data of SiC samples irradiated with high energy Ne ions, found in the literature.

The comparison conﬁrms the role of host lattice amorphization as a limiting factor in the magnetic

3

percolation at high ion energy.

We then present own systematic experimental results, showing the emergence of an artiﬁcial

FM phase in TiO2 hosts, upon irradiation with low energy (≤ 1 keV) Ar ions. As predicted by

our simulations, the magnetic percolation is most affected by sputtering processes at the surface

in the low ion energy regime. The FM phase emerges in an ultrathin region beneath the surface,

whose thickness varies from a few atomic layers down to a magnetic bilayer, depending on the

ion energy. In these ultrathin ﬁlms, the emerging FM phase reaches the full magnetic percolation

limit, where it spans over the complete sample surface area. The magnetic anisotropy is also

investigated, showing a switch from in-plane to out-of-plane easy magnetization direction as the

ion energy and the resulting magnetic layer thickness decreases. This phenomenon is explained

by the contribution of the surface to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

Most of the theoretical work related to artiﬁcial ferromagnets has so far been devoted to un-

derstanding the origin of the magnetic signals observed experimentally in different host systems.

Guided by experimental intuition, a considerable computational effort was undertaken to identify

possible defect structures, that carry non-zero magnetic moment and could explain the FM signals

measured in nominally non-magnetic host systems upon ion irradiation. The method of choice are

spin-polarized electronic structure calculations performed on different levels of DFT, which yield

the magnetic ground state of the defective systems and can provide an estimate of the magnetic

percolation threshold. This is the threshold density of defects needed in a certain host matrix for

a long ranged ordered FM phase to emerge. Most studies rely on supercell methods to model

systems with different defect concentrations. As the number of possible defect structures that

could potentially yield a magnetic ground state in each single host matrix is enormous, studies are

usually limited to investigating simple point defects, such as vacancies or interstitials. Obviously,

an exhaustive search through all possible defect structures is not practical and a better method is

needed.

Considering artiﬁcial ferromagnets created by ion irradiation, a much better starting point

would be to only consider those defect structures that are experimentally accessible, i.e. that are

likely to be created by the impact of energetic ions on the host matrix. Calculations of irradiation

damage have been a standard tool in the context of accelerator physics for a long time. Molec-

inputs the atomic structure of a host material and the ion type and energy range of the ion irradiation. In a

ﬁrst step, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and cluster analysis (CA) algorithms yield possible defect

structures and their corresponding creation probabilities, likely to be formed during the ion irradiation

process. The resulting defective structures are used as input for DFT electronic structure calculations,

giving the magnetic ground state and the percolation limit for each defect type. Finally, using the results of

all calculations and applying Monte Carlo (MC) methods, a magnetic phase diagram is constructed, which

indicates the irradiation parameters likely to create an artiﬁcial FM.

ular dynamics (MD) methods, taking into account different levels of interatomic potentials, exist

and yield accurate simulations of the damage resulting from collision cascades in a wide range of

energies [19]. The resulting damage structures, calculated in large host systems of several thou-

sand atoms, can then be decomposed into smaller units of equivalent defects using cluster analysis

(CA) techniques. These simulations not only yield structures of potential defect complexes arising

in the collision cascades, beyond the simple vacancy or interstitial, but can also give statistical

information about their creation probabilities.

Taking the resulting structures of the defective host material as input for spin-polarized DFT

results. Building on these remarks, we propose the computational scheme depicted in Figure 1,

taking as input the atomic structure of a host material, the type and energy of the ion irradiation,

from which potential defective structures and their creation probabilities are obtained using MD

simulations and CA algorithms. DFT electronic structure calculations are then performed for the

resulting defective structures and their magnetic ground state is determined. For defects yielding

a non-zero magnetic moment, the percolation limit is estimated. Finally, taking into account ion

energy loss in the irradiated host material and the defect formation probabilities predicted by the

MD simulations, a magnetic phase diagram can be constructed using Monte Carlo (MC) methods.

From this phase diagram, quantitative predictions of the total magnetic moment, the magnetic

volume and magnetization can be extracted.

III. HIGH ENERGY ION IRRADIATION IN SiC

To validate the predictions of the computational scheme, we ﬁrst calculate the magnetic phase

diagram of 6H-SiC, resulting from the irradiation with high energy (Eion = 140 keV) Ne ions and

compare the predicted magnetization values with those measured experimentally and published

by Li and coworkers [20]. In the following sections we aim to give a step-by-step example of

the calculations involved in constructing the magnetic phase diagram and extracting quantitative

predictions for the emerging FM phase.

A. Molecular Dynamics Collision Cascade Simulations

To ﬁnd the defects produced in 6H-SiC resulting from high energy ion irradiation, we per-

formed a total of 9600 collision cascade simulations in 6H-SiC using the LAMMPS MD code [21–

23]. The interatomic interactions were modeled using Tersoff/ZBL empirical potentials, as de-

scribed by Devanathan et al. [24] and used previously for similar simulations [25]. To compute the

collision cascades, systems of 20×20×20 unit cells (corresponding to 96000 atoms) with periodic

boundary conditions were constructed. The unit cell parameters were set as a = b = 3.095 ˚A,

c = 15.185 ˚A, α = β = 90◦, γ = 120◦. Twelve initial structures were equilibrated in the micro-

canonical (NVE) ensemble for 10-21 ps, respectively, with a timestep of 1 fs at T = 300 K. One Si

atom and one C atom located at the center of the simulation cells were selected as primary knock-

on atoms (PKA). Their initial kinetic energy was then set to values in the range 5 eV-200 eV by

ﬁxing the initial velocity along 10 different directions sampled from a cone with main axis along

the (001) crystal direction and an aperture of 60◦ (see Figure 2).

After setting the initial kinetic energy of the PKA atom, the systems were let to evolve in three

phases, with timesteps of 0.01 fs, 0.1 fs and 1 fs for 0.1 ps, 1 ps and 10 ps, respectively, in order

to capture the whole ballistic dynamics of the collision cascades.

The resulting collision cascade trajectories were then analyzed using the Ovito library. Single

point defects (vacancies, interstitials, antisites) were identiﬁed using a Wigner-Seitz decompo-

sition of the initial and ﬁnal structure. Defect clusters were then identiﬁed using a clustering

algorithm with a length cutoff of 2.5 ˚A, yielding the number of defect types created during each

of the simulated collision cascades. The large degree of statistical sampling (120 simulations per

PKA type and energy) allowed us to determine average defect creation rates, which are shown

in Figure 3 for the C and Si PKAs in the energy range 5 eV to 200 eV. We ﬁnd a displacement

threshold of Ed = 25 eV and Ed = 40 eV for the C and Si PKA, respectively, in agreement with

previous reports [25].

The most prevalent defects are the C interstitial (CI), C vacancy (CV), Si vacancy (SiV), Si

antisite (SiC) and the di-vacancy (SiV + CV). We note that the creation rates shown in Figure 3 are

given as average number of defects created per PKA event of a certain kinetic energy and type.

In general, incident ions collide with one or more lattice ions, transferring some of their kinetic

energy to the PKA. For a complete picture of the defect creation process, we need to determine

the energy and spacial distribution of PKA events, created by energetic ions. But ﬁrst, we need to

identify those defects that carry non-zero magnetic moment and determine the sign and range of

their exchange interactions.

B. Spin properties of the di-vacancy and Si vacancy in 6H-SiC

The spin properties of both the di-vacancy and the Si-vacancy in SiC have been extensively

investigated due to their potential use as spin-defect qubits, both theoretically [26–31] and exper-

imentally [20, 28, 29, 31–36]. According to spin-density functional theory calculations, the spin

states and interactions strongly depend on the charge state of the defects [26, 27, 29, 34]. While

the negatively charged Si vacancy has a spin-3/2 ground state, the neutral and higher charge states

ground state [27, 29, 37]. In both defects, the calculated spin densities indicate that the polariza-

tion originates from localized states at the C atoms surrounding the Si vacancy.

Wang et al. investigated the exchange coupling between charged di-vacancies as a function of

the defect distance [29] and found that the negatively charged di-vacancies couple ferromagneti-

cally at distances 10-18.5 ˚A, corresponding to a percolation threshold of ∼ 1 at.%.

C. Binary Collision Monte Carlo Simulations

Out of all defects predicted in the collision cascade simulations, the Si and di-vacancy are

the most promising candidates to induce a long-ranged magnetically ordered phase in 6H-SiC, as

they both carry non-zero magnetic moment, tend to couple ferromagnetically and both Si and C

vacancies are created with a high probability (see Figure 3) in the collision cascades.

In order to relate the defect creation rates obtained from the MD collision cascade simulations

to ion irradiation experiments, we need to determine the energy and spacial distribution of PKA

events resulting from the collision of high energy ions with the SiC lattice atoms. We obtain

this using SRIM [38, 39], a widely used binary collision Monte Carlo code, that simulates the

stopping and range of ions in matter by assuming the target material is amorphous. In the full

collision simulation mode, SRIM takes as input the number of ions to simulate, their type and

kinetic energy, the target material composition and density, the displacement threshold of each

target atom type and outputs a list of PKA collision events, including the transferred kinetic energy

and the position.

To be able to compare our computational predictions to the experimental data published by Li

and coworkers [20], we performed SRIM simulations of 105 Ne+ ions at Eion = 140 keV, incident

on amorphous SiC, setting the displacement thresholds of the C atoms to Ed = 25 eV and that

of Si to Ed = 40 eV, according to our MD simulations (see Figure 3). We analyzed the resulting

PKA events using a histogram method with a bin size of 5 eV for the PKA energy, matching

the energy resolution of our MD simulations. The PKA energy and depth (along the irradiation

axis) distribution is shown for the two PKA types in Figure 4. In both cases, the maximum of the

distribution lies around 40-50 eV and at a depth of 160 nm below the surface. The maximum range

of the Ne+ ions is 260 nm. We note that, even though the initial kinetic energy of the ions was set

to 140 keV, more than 90 % of the PKA events occur at an energy below 200 eV, indicating that

the ions transfer most of their kinetic energy to the electronic system of the target material before

undergoing binary collisions with the target nuclei.

D. Quantitative predictions and experimental validation

Combining the results of the MD and SRIM simulations, we calculated the densities of all

defect types found in the MD simulations, as a function of ion ﬂuence in the range 0-5×1014 cm−2

(see Figure 5). Pairs of single C and Si vacancies, created in close proximity were counted towards

the di-vacancy density (Figure 5(b)) and the degree of amorphization (Figure 5(a)) was deﬁned as

the total number of defects per lattice atom. As the creation rate of C vacancies is signiﬁcantly

larger than that of Si vacancies, the resulting density of isolated Si vacancies is negligible and we

will therefore only take into account the di-vacancy defect in our further discussion.

Taking into account a percolation threshold of 1 at.% for the di-vacancy defect [29], we identify

the threshold ion ﬂuence required to induce long-ranged FM order along the irradiation direction,

as indicated in Figure 5 by the lower white line. Below this line, at low ion ﬂuences, the defect

density is too low to create an artiﬁcial FM phase and the material is paramagnetic. Above the

line, at high enough ﬂuences, a magnetic percolation transition occurs and a FM phase emerges.

color scales (right axis) and as a function of depth along the (001) crystal direction (horizontal axis) and the

irradiation ﬂuence (left axis).

As the spin polarization of the di-vacancy defect originates from the C atoms surrounding the Si

vacancy, it appears plausible that a high degree of amorphization could destroy the FM phase. We

have therefore calculated a second threshold ﬂuence, at which the degree of amorphization along

the irradiation direction reaches 50 %, as indicated by the upper white line in Figure 5. Above this

threshold, at least two of the four C atoms surrounding the Si vacancy are displaced on average.

These two boundaries deﬁne a volume, in which a FM phase emerges. By integrating over all

defect magnetic moments in this volume, we obtain the saturation magnetization of the FM phase.

This is shown as a solid line in Figure 6(a), as a function of the irradiation ﬂuence. Up to a ﬂuence

of 2.5 × 1014 cm−2, the magnetization increases linearly, as more defects are created. At higher

ﬂuences, the amorphization threshold is reached in a large portion of the magnetic volume and the

magnetization rapidly decreases.

In order to compare our theoretical predictions with the experimental data published by Li et

al. [20], we calculated the saturation magnetization from the total magnetic moment data mea-

sured using SQUID magnetometry by using the sample area and the depth of the magnetic phase

resulting from our simulations. The resulting magnetization values are indicated in Figure 6(a)

decreases at large enough ﬂuences, matching our theoretical predictions quantitatively.

The authors suspected that the amorphization could play a role in the disappearance of the FM

signal in their samples at larger ﬂuences [20]. Our simulations conﬁrm that the amorphization of

the host lattice is the major limiting factor for the development of a dense FM phase in SiC. This

might also be the case in other materials, where artiﬁcial FM phases have been created using ion

irradiation. Detailed experimental data showing the evolution of such a FM phase as a function of

the ion ﬂuence is scarce. Shimizu et al. measured the magnetic properties of CeO2 single crystals
irradiated with Xe+ ions at Eion = 200 MeV using SQUID magnetometry [40]. Figure 6(b) shows

the evolution of the total saturation magnetic moment of an emerging FM phase in CeO2, as a

function of the ion ﬂuence. There, the magnetic moment follows the same qualitative trend: It ﬁrst

increases rather linearly and at a ﬂuence > 2 × 1013 cm−2, it decreases.

IV. LOW ENERGY ION IRRADIATION IN ANATASE TiO2

Most experimental investigations of artiﬁcial FM phases emerging upon ion irradiation reported

in the literature were performed at high ion energies ≥ 100 keV. This results in a rather large ion

penetration depth and as we showed in the previous section, the evolution of the artiﬁcial FM

phase is limited by the amorphization of the host lattice. In this section, we present results of our

systematic experimental investigation of a FM phase emerging in anatase TiO2 hosts upon low
energy Ar+ ion irradiation (Eion ≤ 1 keV).

A. Experimental Methods

Amorphous TiO2 thin ﬁlms were grown on SrTiO2 substrates by ion beam sputter deposi-

tion [41]. Here a beam of low-energy Ar ions is directed onto a Ti target. Due to momentum and

energy transfer, target particles get sputtered and condense on a substrate. Additionally oxygen

background gas was provided such that TiO2 thin ﬁlms were formed. Ion energy, ion current, and

ion incidence angle were 1000 eV, 7 mA, and 30◦, respectively. The substrates were placed at a

polar emission angle of 40◦ relative to the target normal. The volumetric ﬂow rate of Ar primary

gas was 3.5 sccm and of O2 background gas 2.0 sccm, which resulted in a total working pressure

of 6 × 10−3 Pa. More details are given in Ref. [42]. The ﬁlms have a thickness of 40 nm. After

FIG. 7. X-ray diffraction measurements of the crystallized anatase TiO2 ﬁlms grown on SrTiO3 (100)

substrates. The data shown here were obtained from sample S1000 after the last irradiation step.

annealing at 500◦ C in air for 1h, the ﬁlms crystallize in the anatase phase with the ﬁlm surface

normal along the (001) crystal direction, as conﬁrmed by XRD measurements (see Figure 7).

Three thin ﬁlm samples with a surface area of 5 × 5 mm2 were selected for the ion irradiation

experiments. Each sample was then irradiated with Ar+ ions at Eion = 200 eV (“S200”), 500 eV

(“S500”) and 1000 eV (“S1000”), respectively, using a custom-built DC plasma chamber. The ion

current was measured through a gold frame surrounding the sample during the irradiation process

and was used to calculate the ﬂuence.

The magnetic properties of each sample were characterized before and after each irradiation

step using a commercial SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS XL) using the recipro-

cating sample operation (RSO) mode. In order to ensure the comparability of the results after each

irradiation step, great care has been taken to reduce as much as possible any source of contamina-

tion to the samples and the same protocol and schedule was maintained throughout the experiment.

The samples were clamped in a plastic straw (as shown in Figure 10(b) in [43]), allowing to mea-

sure the magnetic responses to a magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicular and parallel to the ﬁlm sur-

face. The total magnetic moment of the sample was recovered from the raw SQUID voltage signal

using a point dipole approximation. The ﬁnite sample size has been corrected for using methods

described in Ref. [43], by applying a correction factor to the total moment (in-plane: 0.969296,

perpendicular: 1.015966). For magnetic hysteresis loop measurements, m(B), the magnetic ﬁeld

was ﬁrst reduced from 0.1 T to nominally zero in oscillating mode, followed by a magnet quench

to minimize the remanent ﬁeld. In addition, the solenoid hysteresis was corrected for using a cal-

m(T ), the sample temperature was ﬁrst set to T = 380 K, followed by the same magnetic ﬁeld

reset procedure. After cooling the sample down to T = 2 K, a constant magnetic ﬁeld was set and

the zero ﬁeld cooled (ZFC) curve was measured while heating up to T = 380 K followed by the

ﬁeld cooled (FC) measurement. At each temperature step, we waited for 60 seconds to allow the

sample to reach thermal equilibrium prior to the measurement.

To recover the relevant magnetic hysteresis parameters from the experimental data, we use the

following model:

where χ accounts for a linear contribution to the susceptibility, including a diamagnetic response

from the substrate and a paramagnetic response at room temperature and moderate ﬁelds, ms, Bc

and mr are the saturation moment, coercive ﬁeld and remanent moment of a hysteretic response.

After the measurements of sample S500, and before measuring the other two samples, we had

to adjust the “SQUID tuning parameters” (drive power and frequency) as the SQUID was slightly

detuned, resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction of the signal noise.

B. Magnetic phase diagram

To understand the emergence of an artiﬁcial FM phase in TiO2 due to low energy ion irradia-

tion, we used the same computational scheme as for the high energy case, outlined in the previous

section. Robinson et al. [44] performed detailed molecular dynamics simulations of collision cas-

cades in anatase TiO2, due to low energy ion irradiation and calculated the probability of resulting

defect structures, as shown in Figure 2, for collision cascades resulting from Ti and O primary

knock-on atoms (PKA), using a very similar method to ours. At PKA energies near the displace-

ment threshold, Ed = 39 eV for Ti PKAs and Ed = 19 eV for O, the primary defects created

are the di-Frenkel pair (dFP; 40% of Ti PKAs), consisting of two Ti atoms displaced into inter-

stitial sites leaving behind two vacancies and the oxygen vacancy (Ov; 50% of O PKAs) (see

Figure 2(a,c)).

Both the dFP [45] and Ov [46] defects in anatase TiO2 have been investigated previously using

DFT calculations and found to carry a magnetic moment of 2µB and 1µB, respectively. When their

concentration reaches ∼ 5% in the bulk, the magnetic moments start to couple ferromagnetically

and undergo a magnetic percolation transition. A long-ranged ordered phase emerges and persists

even above room temperature [45]. According to reports from Stiller et al., dFP defects are mostly

responsible for the emergence of a FM phase in anatase TiO2 irradiated with low energy Ar+

ions [45]. The Ov defect was found to play a role in magnetic TiO2 doped with Cu [46].

Using SRIM simulations for Ar+ ions at Eion = 200 eV, 500 eV and 1000 eV, and taking into

account the defect creation probabilities (Figure 8), a magnetic phase diagram can be constructed.

At low energies, the sample volume affected by the incident ions is much smaller than in the

high energy case and the effect of surface sputtering has to be taken into account. SRIM allows

to calculate the sputtering rate. We ﬁnd values of 1.1, 1.5 and 2.3 nm / (1016 ions / cm2) at ion

energies of 200 eV, 500 eV and 1000 eV, respectively.

The solid line indicates the magnetic percolation

transition between unordered (paramagnetic) and FM phases.

At ﬂuences > 4 × 1015 cm−2, the defect creation and sputtering processes are at equilibrium.

The volume and defect densities of the emerging FM phase stay constant over the whole ﬂuence

range. The equilibrium volume depends on the ion energy, as indicated by the thickness of the

FM regions along the irradiation direction in Figure 9. At Eion = 200 eV, the emerging FM layer
grows to an equilibrium thickness dFM = 4.6 ˚A, corresponding to 0.48c (c = 9.51 ˚A, the Anatase
lattice constant). At Eion = 500 eV we ﬁnd an equilibrium thickness dFM = 12.0 ˚A (= 1.26c) and
at Eion = 1000 eV, dFM = 19.9 ˚A (= 2.09c). The anatase unit cell consists of four layers, stacked

along the (001) crystal direction. Therefore, the emerging FM phase is expected to be restricted to

the ﬁrst 2, 4 and 8 layers of the host lattice, respectively.

C. Experimental observation of the emerging FM phase in Anatase TiO2

Figure 10(a) shows two typical hysteresis curves, measured at room temperature and after sam-

ple S1000 had been irradiated with a ﬂuence of 0.6 × 1016 cm−2 (blue) and 8.7 × 1016 cm−2

(orange). After subtracting the linear diamagnetic background (Figure 10(b)), a hysteretic FM sig-

nal clearly appears, showing a magnetic moment at saturation msat that increases with ion ﬂuence

(hysteresis curves at all irradiation ﬂuences are shown in Figures S1-S3 in the supporting infor-

mation). Figure 10(c) shows the zero-ﬁeld cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld cooled (FC) curves, measured

at an irradiation ﬂuence of 18.3 × 1016 cm−2, in the temperature range 2-380 K and at an applied

magnetic ﬁeld of B = 0.05 T. The opening between the ZFC and FC curves is a clear sign of a

FM phase.

By systematically measuring the magnetic hysteresis of the samples as a function of the irradi-

ation ﬂuence, we can gain some insight into the evolution of the emerging FM phase. Figure 11(a)

shows the total magnetic moment at saturation at T = 300 K, msat, after subtracting the linear dia-

magnetic background, as a function of the irradiation ﬂuence, for the three samples S200, S500 and

S1000. The values of msat have been obtained by ﬁtting the hysteresis curves with Equation (1).

The background signal m0, measured in each sample before any irradiation was subtracted. The

magnetization Msat was calculated from the measured total moment msat taking into account the

equilibrium volume of the magnetic phase predicted from the phase diagram (Figure 9).

We ﬁrst observe that the moment at saturation increases with increasing total irradiation ﬂu-

ence and saturates at high ﬂuences. This is expected, as increasing the irradiation ﬂuence also

increases the density of dFP defect complexes until the defect creation and sputtering processes

reach equilibrium, in agreement with the phase diagram (Figure 9). The saturation magnetization

of all three samples reaches values of the order of 35 Am2kg−1, which corresponds to a mean dFP

concentration of ∼ 17 at. % or one dFP per unit cell.

By numerically integrating the dFP concentration found in our calculations over the volume of

the FM phase in Figure 9 and taking into account the magnetic moment (2µB) of each dFP defect,

we can calculate the expected magnetization and total moment of the samples as a function of the

irradiation ﬂuence. The result is shown in Figure 11 as solid lines. The oscillations are numerical

artifacts due to the discretization of the phase diagram. At the lowest ion energy (sample S200),

our predictions show excellent agreement with the experimental data. The predicted equilibrium

magnetization at high irradiation ﬂuences of all three samples also agrees very well with our

measurements. The evolution of the magnetization of sample S1000 to the equilibrium value, on

the other hand, does not agree well with our calculations, that predict a much steeper approach to

equilibrium. In fact, it appears like the saturation moment of sample S1000 ﬁrst follows the same

evolution as sample S200 (Figure 11) and then slowly increases to the equilibrium value.

D. The magnetic percolation process

We have seen in Figure 9 that the FM phase emerges in an ultrathin region of thickness between

2 and 8 anatase layers. To better understand the evolution of these ultrathin FM layers, it is

instructive to take a closer look at the magnetic percolation process, i.e. the transition from isolated

local magnetic moments to a long-ranged ordered phase upon increasing the defect density.

A system of dilute defects in a host lattice that interact magnetically on a ﬁnite length scale can

be described using the framework of percolation theory [47, 48]. In the site-percolation model,

sites on the host lattice can be occupied by a defect and one can associate a probability p with

the occupation of a site. At p = 0, no defects are present in the system and at p = 1, all sites

through the density of possible sites that can host a defect.

The length scale of the magnetic interaction, namely the exchange coupling, determines

whether two occupied sites are linked: Two occupied sites that are close enough to each other

to interact ferromagnetically through the exchange interaction form a percolation domain. The

magnetic moments associated to each site belonging to one percolation domain are correlated,

while those associated to different percolation domains behave independently.

The site-percolation model describes a second order geometrical phase transition, that occurs

at a critical occupation probability pc. At p < pc, in the subcritical regime, small isolated percola-

tion domains form. The microscopic magnetic moments within each of these percolation domains

are aligned parallel to each other due to the ferromagnetic coupling, but their orientation is arbi-

trary. The summed magnetic moment of each domain can be treated as one large paramagnetic

center and the system is in a super-paramagnetic phase. At p > pc, in the supercritical regime,

one large percolation domain exists that spans over the whole system volume. This domain is

called the percolation continent and exhibits the features of a ferromagnet, such as a spontaneous

magnetization.

At criticality, when p ∼ pc, the percolation continent emerges and the defective host system

becomes ferromagnetic. As with all second order phase transitions, the percolation transition can

be described by an order parameter, namely the probability P∞, that a random defect belongs to

the percolation continent. Near criticality, the evolution of the order parameter follows a power

law of the form

P∞ ∝ (p − pc)β,

(2)

with a universal critical exponent β, that only depends on the dimensionality of the system.

We simulate the magnetic percolation process in a grid of 200 × 200 anatase TiO2 unit cells

and a thickness of 1, 2 and 3 layers, enforcing periodic conditions on the lateral boundaries. For

comparison, we perform the same simulations in a 200×200×200 unit cell grid, enforcing periodic

boundary conditions in all three directions for a bulk system. Magnetic dFP defects are randomly

distributed throughout the grids, varying the total defect concentration. Only nearest neighbor

interactions between dFP defects are taken into account, such that two nearest neighbor cells, each

containing a dFP defect, interact ferromagnetically and form a percolation domain. Figure 12(a)

shows the size of the largest of the domains, the percolation continent, normalized to the total size

of the grid. Figure 12(b) shows the number of independent percolation domains within the grid,

as a function of the dFP defect concentration, normalized to the total number of cells in the grids.

Varying the defect density, we see three regimes: at low concentration (< 5 at. % in the mono-

layer), the sample is paramagnetic and the percolation domains are small (see Figure 12(c)). In

the intermediate regime (5-9 at. % in the monolayer), the magnetic dFP defects start to interact

and the domains grow rapidly in size (see Figure 12(d)). At the percolation threshold, 9 at. %,

7.5 at.%, 6 at.% and 5 at. % in the mono-, bi-, trilayer and the bulk system, respectively, the

domains merge and the percolation continent grows rapidly until spanning over the whole grid

(see Figure 12(e)). We note that at a dFP density of 17 at. %, which we found at equilibrium in

Figure 11, the percolation continent has fully evolved and the order parameter P∞ = 1.

Table I shows the critical exponents obtained by ﬁtting the curves shown in Figure 12(a) to

Equation (2). Experimentally, the magnetic percolation transition can be obtained by taking the

remanent magnetic moment at zero applied magnetic ﬁeld and at high temperatures. Indeed, at ion

ﬂuences below the percolation transition, the samples are expected to be (super-)paramagnetic and

no remanence is expected above the blocking temperature. Near the percolation transition, when

the percolation continent forms at a critical ﬂuence fc, the remanent magnetic moment should

follow the same critical behavior as the order parameter P∞.

Figure 13 shows the evolution of the remanent magnetic moment mrem measured in samples

S200 and S1000 as a function of the irradiation ﬂuence f . By ﬁtting the data to a power law

(mrem ∝ (f − f0)β), we ﬁnd critical ﬂuences f0 = 5 × 1015 cm−2 and 2.5 × 1016 cm−2 for

samples S200 and S1000, respectively. The resulting critical exponents are β = 0.22 ± 0.04 and

0.42±0.07, respectively. Comparing these exponents to the theoretical values (Table I), we see that

the remanence observed in sample S1000 follows the critical behavior of a bulk 3D percolation

transition, while sample S200 follows the critical behavior of a magnetic bilayer system. These

results match very well with the aforementioned thickness of the FM phases (see Figure 9), that

for varying dFP concentrations. Nearest neighbor cells containing a dFP interact and form percolation

domains. Varying the dFP concentration, three regimes can be seen: at low concentration (< 5 at. % in

the monolayer), the sample is paramagnetic and the percolation domains are small. In the intermediate

regime (5-9 at. % in the monolayer), the magnetic dFP defects start to interact and the domains grow

rapidly in size. At the percolation threshold, 9 at. %, 7.5 at.%, 6 at.% and 5 at. % in the mono-, bi-, trilayer

and the bulk system, respectively, the domains merge and form a large percolation continent. The size of

V. DIMENSIONALITY AND SURFACE EFFECTS, EMERGENCE OF A PERPENDICULAR

MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY

Two dimensional long ranged magnetic order has long been thought to be impossible at ﬁnite

temperatures, as stated by the Mermin-Wagner (MW) theorem [49]: In bulk 3D ferromagnets, the

exchange interaction asserts a long range magnetic order up to the Curie temperature, TC, where

thermal ﬂuctuations become strong enough to randomize the spin orientation. In 2D magnetic

systems with isotropic exchange interaction, the dimensionality effect leads to an abrupt jump in

the magnon dispersion and therefore strong spin excitations at any ﬁnite temperature, destroying

the magnetic order. The presence of a strong uniaxial local magnetic anisotropy opens a gap

in the magnon dispersion, counteracting the Mermin-Wagner theorem in 2D and restoring long

51] and 2D magnetic van der Waals materials [10, 52, 53]. 2D magnetic structures are not only

interesting from a fundamental physics perspective, but also regarding their possible applications

in 2D spintronics, magnonics or spin-orbitronics [1–3, 10, 53]. In the following section, we shall

show the role of the magnetic anisotropy and of the surface to stabilize the artiﬁcial FM phase at

room temperature in TiO2 hosts, even in two dimensions.

A. Measuring the magnetic anisotropy of the emerging FM phase in TiO2 hosts

Figure 14 shows measurements of the magnetic hysteresis loops obtained by applying an exter-

nal magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the ﬁlm surface (blue) and perpendicular to the surface (orange) of

the three TiO2 samples. In panels (a,c), the raw signals are shown and a clear magnetic anisotropy

is visible. After subtracting the linear diamagnetic contribution (Figure 14(b,d)), the total mag-

netic anisotropy energy (MAE) can be calculated as the area difference between the two curves.

Here, we calculated the area difference by ﬁrst ﬁtting Equation (1) to the experimental data and

integrating the result analytically. To compensate differences in the resulting saturation moments

msat for the two ﬁeld orientations, e.g. due to ﬁtting error or ﬁnite sample size effects (see Sec-

tion IV.A), we rescaled the values of msat and mrem, such that msat coincides. The sign is deﬁned

such that positive MAE indicates a magnetic easy in-plane direction, parallel to the ﬁlm surface

while a negative MAE indicates an out-of-plane easy axis. More details are given in the supporting

information. At the selected irradiation ﬂuences, sample S200 (panels (a,b)) shows a perpendicular

magnetic anisotropy while sample S500 (panels (c,d)) shows an in-plane anisotropy.

Figure 15 shows the total MAE as a function of the irradiation ﬂuence, of the samples S200 (a)

and S500 (b). In sample S200, where the thickness of the FM phase is estimated to only two layers

of the host lattice, the MAE is negative throughout all irradiation ﬂuences, indicating a magnetic

easy axis normal to the ﬁlm surface. In sample S500, the MAE is positive and its magnitude is

roughly four times larger than that of sample S200. For sample S500, the magnetic phase diagram

(Figure 9) predicts a FM phase spanning the ﬁrst four layers of the ﬁlm surface, i.e. twice as many

as for sample S200, hinting towards the role of the surface in the emergence of a perpendicular

magnetic anisotropy.

S200 after irradiation with a ﬂuence of 2.5 × 1016 cm−2 and panels (c),(d) for sample S500 at a ﬂuence of

6.0 × 1016 cm−2.

B. DFT electronic structure calculations of the defective TiO2 surface

To understand the origin of the magnetic anisotropy shown in Figure 15, we performed

DFT electronic structure calculations using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave

(FLAPW) method implemented in the FLEUR code, including spin-orbit interaction and a Hub-

bard term U = 4.0 eV, on a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell of anatase TiO2, containing one dFP defect

Kmax × aMT = 7.0. The atomic structure was relaxed using a 2 × 2 × 2 k-point grid and the

ﬁnal charge and spin density was calculated using a 6 × 6 × 6 k-point grid. Figure 16(a) shows

the relaxed bulk atomic structure, with the two Ti interstitials colored in pink. The isosurface at a
spin density of 0.005µBa−3
0

is shown in yellow and is mainly located around the two interstitials

and their neighboring Ti lattice atoms in the (010) plane, having dxz character, as conﬁrmed by

the density of states (Figure 16(a)). We ﬁnd a total magnetic moment of 2µB/dFP defect. These

calculations match well with those presented by Stiller et al. [45]. We also calculated the MAE

from the total energy difference between the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization state and

ﬁnd MAE = 11 µeV/atom with an (001) easy-plane in the bulk, as opposed to the out-of-plane

easy axis found by Stiller et al [45].

We then calculated the electronic structure of the dFP defect at the (001) anatase surface, using

a 3 × 3 supercell containing four layers of anatase, as shown in Figure 16(b). Only the lower

two layers were relaxed, while the upper two were held ﬁxed at the bulk atomic positions. After

structural relaxation, the surface layer shows displacements comparable to values found in the
literature [54] (α = 142◦, Ti5c–O2c (short) = 1.813 ˚A, Ti5c–O2c (long) = 2.010 ˚A, Ti5c–O3c =

as in the bulk around the interstitial Tii1 on the second layer. On the ﬁrst layer, on the other

hand, the spin density at interstitial Tii2 changes strongly owing to the reduced coordination.

There, the Ti 3dz2 orbital is mainly spin polarized, as reﬂected by the DOS (Figure 17(b)). The

magnetic anisotropy at the (001) surface results in an out-of-plane easy axis with a large MAE =

−137 µeV/atom.

These results together with the calculated defect distribution (Figure 9) explain the measured

MAE (Figure 15): At low ion energy of Eion = 200 eV (sample S200), the FM phase emerges in

the ﬁrst two layers at the ﬁlm surface, resulting in a large negative MAE. At higher ion energies,

the FM phase emerges in a larger volume and also has contributions from bulk states, which favor

an in-plane easy-axis. Depending on the local distribution of the defects, either the surface or the

The computational methods proposed in this work serve as a viable route toward the systematic

discovery of new artiﬁcial functional magnetic materials that can be created experimentally by

ion irradiation techniques. With a minimal amount of input parameters, the scheme provides

excellent quantitative predictions in a large range of ion energies. The information gained from

ﬁrst principles helps to understand existing experimental results and notably solve the inherent

problem of the experimental uncertainty regarding the magnetic volume, which has been a major

source of controversy.

By revisiting experimental results from the literature of a FM phase emerging in SiC upon high

energy ion irradiation and comparing them to our computational predictions, we found that the

main process limiting the evolution of the artiﬁcial FM phase at high ion energies is the amor-

phization of the host lattice.

In the case of low ion energies, sputtering of lattice atoms at the surface plays an important role

and limits the degree of amorphization, as we demonstrated experimentally in anatase TiO2 hosts.

When the defect production and sputtering processes reach an equilibrium, high defect densities

(up to 17 at. %) can be created, which allows full magnetic percolation. We have shown that at

low enough ion energies (Eion = 200 eV in the TiO2), ultrathin ferromagnetic ﬁlms down to a

magnetic bilayer can be created.

In the ultrathin artiﬁcial FM layers created in TiO2 hosts, we have investigated the magnetic

anisotropy and showed that a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy emerges, depending on the thick-

ness of the magnetic phase. We could identify the origin of this PMA in the contribution of

magnetic surface states, as shown by DFT calculations.

Figure 21 shows the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of sample S200 and S500 as a function

of the irradiation ﬂuence. The MAE was obtained from magnetic hysteresis curves such as those

shown for some example ﬂuences. Hysteresis curves were measured once with the magnetic ﬁeld

applied in-plane (blue bullets) and perpendicular to the sample surface (orange bullets). Each

curve was then ﬁt using Equation (B1)

magnetic energy was then calculated along the virgin curve as
