ABSTRACT

In this work we investigate the thermal structure of an oﬀ-limb active region in various non-ﬂaring areas, as it
provides key information on the way these structures are heated.
In particular, we concentrate in the very hot
component (> 3 MK) as it is a crucial element to discriminate between diﬀerent heating mechanisms. We present
an analysis using Fe and Ca emission lines from both SOHO/SUMER and HINODE/EIS. A dataset covering all
ionization stages from Fe X to Fe XIX has been used for the thermal analysis (both DEM and EM). Ca XIV is used
for the SUMER-EIS radiometric cross-calibration. We show how the very hot plasma is present and persistent almost
everywhere in the core of the limb AR. The oﬀ-limb AR is clearly structured in Fe XVIII. Almost everywhere, the EM
analysis reveals plasma at 10 MK (visible in Fe XIX emission) which is down to 0.1% of EM of the main 3 MK plasma.
We estimate the power law index of the hot tail of the EM to be between −8.5 and −4.4. However, we leave an open
question on the possible existence of a small minor peak at around 10 MK. The absence in some part of the AR of
Fe XIX and Fe XXIII lines (which fall into our spectral range) enables us to determine an upper limit on the EM at such
temperatures. Our results include a new Ca XIV 943.59 ˚A atomic model.

1. INTRODUCTION

Decades of observations have unveiled the diﬃcult
task of understanding how and where the energy is de-
posited for the creation and maintenance of the solar
corona. Various physical mechanisms have been pro-
posed (see Reale 2014, for a review) which may dom-
inate depending on the local environment. Active re-
gions (AR) are the most visible manifestation of the
enduring corona. These are the hottest part of the
non ﬂaring corona, with strong UV and X-ray emission.
ARs are generally composed of coronal loops which are
classed in two main thermal categories: the hot and
low-lying loops (3MK), less dense than equilibrium con-
ditions, which are concentrated in the core; the warm
loops (1MK), larger and more dense than equilibrium
conditions, which are located above the AR core (Reale
It is not yet clear if these diﬀerent properties
2014).
are the result of diﬀerent physical processes at work or
are the manifestation of the same process observed in a
diﬀerent evolutionary state.

In recent years new observational signatures of coro-
nal heating have been identiﬁed, which we believe, if
completely understood, could be essential to progress-
ing our understanding of the corona: a small amount of
very hot plasma (> 5 MK) has been detected in sev-
eral quiescent ARs (see e.g. Reale (2014) for a review).
This detection is important as it conﬁrms a prediction
made several years earlier from the the modeling of coro-
nal loops heated impulsively over small (sub-resolution)
scales (e.g. Parker 1988; Cargill 1994; Klimchuk 2006,
2015). Such models predict at larger spatial scales (at
the spatial resolution reached by the modern instru-
ments) a multi-thermal plasma along the line of sight.
The very hot plasma provides evidence of the transi-
tory (short-lifetime) state of the cooling plasma in these
loops. The importance of observing such small amounts
of very hot plasma relies on the fact that it is unique
to impulsive heating events. This is the signature, for
an unresolved spatial scale, of thin loops (strands) each
heated independently over a short time.

One of the various diagnostics techniques used to test
coronal heating models is the sampling of the heating-
cooling process in loops, which shows diﬀerent obser-
vational signatures depending on the way the heating
happens. The diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) dis-
tribution with the temperature samples this process
and is a common way of investigating the heating of
loops (Cargill 2014). A typical AR DEM increases
as a power law of the temperature up to a maximum
around 3 MK, with an index which may change and
probably depends on the level of magnetic ﬂux. Typi-
cally EM ∼ T 3−5 (Warren et al. 2012; Del Zanna et al.

2015b). This index constrains the frequency at which
the energy is released in the form of heating. At tem-
peratures above the peak, the DEM decreases drasti-
cally, but the diﬃculty of the measurements (mostly
carried out with EUV data) makes it hard to deﬁne

most of the cases it can be ﬁtted with a power law func-
tion, but simulations of nanoﬂares heating reveal that
this is not always the case (Barnes et al. 2016). This
high temperature component of the DEM is the signa-
ture of the ﬁrst phase of cooling which, for this rea-
son, possibly conserves more information on the heat-
ing process and the amount of energy deposited (e.g.
Parenti et al. 2006). The existing EUV instruments
have diﬃculty in detecting emission above about 5 MK
as there is very little plasma at these temperatures
(Winebarger et al. 2012) and because only a few rela-
tively weak UV spectral lines form at these tempera-
tures. For these reasons the DEM is not well constrained
at high temperatures. X-ray spectra are more suitable,
see for instance results from SMM Del Zanna & Mason
(2014) and references therein. The upper limits in the
DEM/EM imposed by the the measured ﬂuxes that we
found in the literature using EUV spectra are given
by Hinode/EIS Ca XVII, SOHO/SUMER Fe XVIII and
SDO/AIA 94 channel (Fe XVIII). Estimations from these
datasets of the power law index (EM ∼ T α) change
from -6 to about -14 (Warren et al. (2012) see Table 5).
The sounding rocket EUNIS-13 (Brosius et al. 2014) en-
abled measurements of extended Fe XIX emission in an
on-disk AR. Without the possibility of performing a full
DEM analysis, they provided a Fe XII/Fe XIX EM ratio
of about 0.59 in the AR core. This assesses the diﬀer-
ence a relation between relatively cool coronal plasma
(1.5 MK) and much hotter plasma at about 10 MK.

In recent years observations of non-ﬂaring ARs with
X-ray instruments has intensiﬁed with the purpose of
better constraining this slope (e.g. Miceli et al. 2012;
Sylwester et al. 2010; Shestov et al. 2010). Additional
constraints at high temperatures have been obtained
combining EUV and Hinode/XRT soft-X ray emission
(Golub et al. 2007) for an on disk AR (e.g. Reale et al.
2009b; Testa et al. 2011; Petralia et al. 2014). The re-
sults found were about two orders of magnitude vari-
ation of the EM from 3 − 10 MK. RHESSI, even
though it is not sensitive to this faint plasma, has re-
vealed its presence in the 6 − 10 MK range (McTiernan
2009; Reale et al. 2009a). Most recently, Hannah et al.
(2016), using the NUSTAR hard X-ray telescope, found
an even larger decrease of the EM by imposing upper
limits on this quantity due the absence of observed emis-
sion at high temperature. Similarly, the FOXSI hard

X-ray emission sounding rocket (Ishikawa et al. 2014)
provided an upper limit to the DEM above 8 MK for an
on disk AR.

In this paper we address the issue of spatially and tem-
porally characterizing the high temperature emission of
a non-ﬂaring active region with the aim of providing fur-
ther constraints to the heating mechanism responsible
for its formation and maintenance. Even though such
plasma has been observed in several active regions, at
present very little is known about the spatial and tem-
poral distribution within the same active region. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that the spatial distri-
bution of this very hot component is given at diﬀerent
heights above the limb.

To minimize uncertainties in quantifying this plasma
and its temperature, we used spectroscopic data from
a single element (Fe). For the ﬁrst time this type of
analysis is carried out combining the SOHO/SUMER
and Hinode/EIS spectra allowing the observation of iron
lines in contiguous ionization stage from Fe X to Fe XIX
to be used. This choice of instruments combination is
at present unique: in provides a line sequence of a single
element in a broad temperature range and lets our ther-
mal analysis be independent of the plasma composition.
We provide evidence of persistent emission from Fe XIX
high in the corona, above the limb.

After presenting our observations in Section 2 and the
data reduction in Section 3, we introduce the diagnostic
technique in Section 4. Section 5 reports the results on
the temporal analysis, Section 6 presents the inter cal-
ibration of the two instruments, while the results from
the thermal analysis is given in Section 7. The conclu-
sions are summarized in Section 8.

2. OBSERVATIONS

We ran HOP (Hinode Operation Plan) 211 on ac-
tive region 11459 for several hours at the west limb
between the 27 and 28 April 2012 using both the
SOHO/SUMER (Wilhelm et al. 1995) and the Hin-
ode/EIS (Culhane et al. 2007) spectrometers (Figure
1).

SUMER: After the loss of Detector A in 2006, due to
failure of the readout electronics, only the B Detector
remained available. In mid-2009, a degradation was ob-
served in the center of the active area of the detector. As
a protective measure, it was necessary to reduce the high
voltage and the consequent reduction of the overall gain
led to a drop of sensitivity in the central, KBr-coated,
part of the photocathode, where it fell below detectable
thresholds. Only the two uncoated (bare) areas of the
detector (about 200 pixels each) were usable at the time
of our observations. Additionally, since the resistivity

of the microchannel plate (MCP) was observed to de-
crease with increasing temperature, to avoid a runaway
eﬀect, pauses were added in the observing sequences.
All SUMER data sequences discussed here are made of
sequences of 60 exposures of 75s each. After each pair
of exposures a pause was added (of about 190s for the
three sequences closest to the solar limb and of about
210s for the three sequences at a greater distance above
the limb). Thus, each sequence can be thought as 30
regularly spaced pairs of 75s exposures.

SUMER observed in a sit-and-stare mode using the
1′′ × 300′′ slit for about eight hours (16:02:08 UT to
00:28:58UT on the 27th) centered at a solar distance
of 992′′.
In the following this will be called slit posi-
tion 1. During this time SUMER scanned the wave-
length range needed to cover the observation of Fe XVII,
Fe XVIII (Ca XIV) and Fe XIX as listed in Table 1. As a
result, each Fe line was observed for about two hours
(60 exposures with 75 sec exposure time). An example
of the spectra for these lines is shown in Figure 2.

A second sequence of observations, starting on the
28th at 00:35:55UT, was made by moving the pointing
west of about 60′′. After a ﬁrst sequence which used
the same slit, the slit was changed to 4′′ × 300′′ when
scanning Fe XVII and XIX (in the following we call this
outer slit position as position 2, see also Table 1).
EIS: EIS data consist of three rasters nominally pointed
at the two SUMER slit center positions. Each raster
was scanned in about two hours starting at 18:19:33 UT.
The observing program used the 2′′ slit, which scanned
eastward over 82 positions with 2′′step and 90 seconds
exposure time. The ﬁnal ﬁeld of view is 164′′ × 376′′.
Details of the observations are given in Table 1.

Our observations occured during the Hinode eclipse
season, with the result that not all the common ﬁeld of
view of SUMER and EIS was exploitable. This is shown
in Figure 1.
We point out that the data we used are not all co-
temporal. For this study, we tried to select quiescent
areas of the AR to minimize the temporal evolution of
the plasma. However, this aspect has to be taken into
account in the interpretation of our results. We discuss
this aspect in Section 5.
Prior to and during our observations, AR 11459 ﬂared a
few times, with moderate intensity. These ﬂaring events
left some signatures on our datasets. Some small activ-
ity had already happened while observing with SUMER
in slit position 1, while observing the Fe XVIII 1118.0575
˚A. A hot loop system passed through the SUMER slit
as shown in Figures 3 and 12. This was also imaged
by the second raster of EIS. The ﬁrst ﬂare happened on
the 27th of April with the peak at 21:04UT. A C2.2 ﬂare

4

Parenti et al.

followed in the same region peaking at 23:39UT while
SUMER was observing Fe XVII 1153.16 ˚A (Figure 3).
On the 28th there was a C1.5 ﬂare (peak at 0:43UT)
and a C1.4 (peak at 1:54UT), but our data does not
look to be aﬀected. We discuss this in more detail in
the following sections. In our analysis we also used the
continuous monitoring provided by SDO/AIA for refer-
ence and comparison.

As the aim of this work is to investigate the quies-
cent conditions of ARs, the data aﬀected by the ﬂares
were discarded from our analysis. Details of our data
selection are given in the next Section.

3. DATA REDUCTION

The SUMER data were decompressed, wavelength-
reversed, corrected for dead-time losses, local-gain de-
pression, ﬂat-ﬁeld, and image distortion induced by the
readout electronics. All the above steps were performed
by using the standard software provided in SolarSof t
(Freeland & Handy 1998).

SUMER oﬀ-limb data may be aﬀected by stray-light.
We estimated this contribution in two ways (detailed
in Appendix B). SUMER spectra are not wavelength
calibrated. We performed this calibration (presented in
Appendix C).

The EIS data were corrected for instrumental ef-
fects and calibrated applying the eis prep.pro (version
29-Jan-2015) available on SolarSof t. The radiomet-
ric calibration has recently been further improved by
Del Zanna (2013a) and Warren et al. (2014). For our
analysis we used the Del Zanna (2013a) calibration, but
a discussion of the inﬂuence on the results obtained us-
ing a diﬀerent calibration is presented in Section 6.
Before performing the data analysis, we processed the
data to take into account various issues that could aﬀect
results. These are presented below.

We started by carrying out a co-alignment of the ﬁelds
of views of EIS and SUMER, which was done by using
the SDO/AIA images for reference. This was done for
two reasons: the SUMER slit follows the SOHO roll,
which is not aligned North-South, and the EIS raster
data has a temporal dependence. The task is not easy
as we were dealing with oﬀ-limb data where the struc-
turing and image contrast are less marked than on-disk.
For the ﬁrst SUMER slit position 1, we found that the
best way to proceed to co-align SUMER-AIA was to use
the ﬂare data (SUMER Fe XVIII and AIA 94 channel).
For the slit position 2 we used the pair SUMER Ca X
557.766 ˚A with AIA 171, and SUMER Ca X 574.011
˚A with AIA 171. The two Ca lines are observed about
two hours apart, but the result of these two alignments
were similar within 2′′. Details of this work are given in

Appendix A and the results are listed in column four of
Table 1.

It is known that EIS is not aligned with respect to
AIA. We ﬁrst used the eis aia of f set.pro IDL proce-
dure available in the SolarSof t database to correct our
EIS data. However, we were not satisﬁed with our re-
sults and we decided to proceed with an independent
manual co-alignment based on cross-correlation. We
used the AIA 195 channel and EIS Fe XII 192.394 ˚A.
The details of the method are given in Appendix A and
the results are given in Table 1.

3.1. Spectral line selection

Table 2 gives the list of the observed spectral lines and
their ﬂuxes used in this work. To reduce the uncertain-
ties in the results of the thermal analysis, we minimized
the eﬀect of the elements abundance, by selecting only
lines from Fe ions. We have enough Fe ions to cover the
temperature range 6 < log T < 6.95. In addition, as we
shall show, we performed several tests to monitor the
eﬀects of elemental composition on our results. To this
line list we added Si VII to constrain the DEM and EM
at low temperatures and Ca XIV, which was used for the
intercalibration EIS-SUMER (see Sec. 6). This is, in
fact, the only ion which is present in both instruments
whose lines are free from blends. Our results should
not be aﬀected by element abundance variations as the
chosen ions are all from low First Ionization Potential
elements. In addition, the Ca XIV is formed at a temper-
ature similar to Fe XV and Fe XVI which were observed
by EIS.

The EIS high temperature lines from ions above
Ca XIV and Fe XVI were absent or unusable because
they were too blended. We also tried to extract Ca XVII
192.853 ˚A but with no success. To do this, we used
the Ko et al. (2009) method, which deblends this line
from the Fe XI and O V lines. We used the theoretical
CHIANTI ratio between the Fe XI 188.1/192.8 to ﬁx
the Fe XI 192.8 ˚A proﬁle parameters, but could not
ﬁnd any good solutions to the multi-line ﬁtting. We
then recalculated this ratio directly for the data by se-
lecting a quiet oﬀ-disk area far from the limb, where the
192.8 ˚A line was very symmetric, and did not show
any evidence of the presence of O V and Ca XVII. We
then assumed that O V and Ca XVII were absent. With
this new ratio value we found the best solution of the
multi-Gaussian ﬁtting was one in which Ca XVII line
was absent. We concluded that in our data, this line
was absent or too faint to be measured. In conclusion,
the high temperature plasma is only covered by the
SUMER data. Our analysis was carried out over sev-
eral masks as described in the following Sections. We

Parenti et al.

used the eis mask spectrum.pro to select the masks
in the EIS rasters and spec gauss eis.pro available in
SolarSof t to perform a multi-Gaussian ﬁtting of the
resulting spectra.

Amongst the hot lines in the SUMER spectra, the
Fe XVIII 974.860 ˚A blend required particular attention
(see Figure 2). This blend has previously been discussed
by Teriaca et al. (2012) and is due to the presence of a
ghost image (caused by the electronics) of the H I 972.54
˚A line falling about 2.8 ˚A red-ward of this line, and Si
VIII 974.58 ˚A. The amplitude of the ghost has been esti-
mated by these authors to be about 1/200 the main line
and it cannot easily be ﬁtted within the blend. Having
the H I 972.54 ˚A line in our spectra, we could estimate
the ghost by adopting this value to correct our Fe line
ﬂux. We found its contribution to be only 1% to 2%.
The Fe XVIII line was ﬁtted using two Gaussians pro-
ﬁles in order to deblend it from the Si VIII. However, the
result for the diﬀerent masks was not always satisfying.
We then estimated the contribution of the Si VIII by
calculating the intensity ratio with the Si VIII 1182.48
˚A lines we had in the spectrum, which is well isolated
and has similar amplitude. We estimated this ratio from
our data by selecting a quiet region (mask F ) where Fe
XIX is absent and we expected to have none or a very
small contribution of Fe XVIII to the blend. The result
of the double Gaussian ﬁt to the spectra of mask F gives
the Si VIII 974.58/ 1182.48 ˚A = 1.04. This value is con-
sistent with Feldman et al. (1997) oﬀ-limb observation
who found a value 1 for this ratio, while Curdt et al.
(2004) found a smaller value (0.7). We adopted our re-
sult to correct the Fe XVIII in our masks. Considering
that in the masks chosen for the thermal analysis the
Fe XVIII line is about 20 times brighter than the Si VIII
1182.48 ˚A, our uncertainty on the blend remains within
the assumed 20% uncertainty of the ﬂuxes.

We indeed assumed an error of 20% in the lines ﬂux.
This value includes uncertainties in the atomic physics,
ionization/recombination rates calculations (which, for
certain ions could be larger). We are aware that other
factors may arise to increase the uncertainty. For in-
stance, the EIS calibration which will be discussed in
Sec. 6. The lack of co-temporal data may also imply
some inconsistency in the analysis. This will be dis-
cussed in Sec. 8.

Figure 2 shows an example of the hot lines in the
SUMER spectra for mask A together with the result
of multi-Gaussian ﬁtting.

3.2. Upper limit on the ﬂux for Fe XIX and Fe XXIII

Above 3 MK the non ﬂaring plasma produces faint
emission. To better constrain our thermal analysis we

estimated an upper limit of the ﬂux for those ﬂaring
lines falling in the spectral range of our data, but which
were not visible. This is the case for SUMER Fe XIX
1118.06 ˚A in mask B and for the EIS Fe XXIII 263.77
˚A in the other masks.

Assuming a Poisson background statistics approxi-
mated by a Gaussian, we set a 3σ conﬁdence level as
the minimum threshold for detection of the line signal
above the background photon counts. We selected a
wavelength interval similar to the expected line width.
We used this to calculate the minimum ﬂux needed for
the spectral line to be measurable. The results are given
in Table 2.

4. PLASMA DIAGNOSTICS METHODS

We summarise the plasma diagnostics that are used in
this work, while further details can be found in Parenti
(2015).

For the EUV-UV optically thin lines the total intensity

is given by

I(λ) =

1
4π Zl

Ab G(Te, ne) nenH dl

(1)

where l

is the line of sight through the emitting
plasma, Ab is the abundance of the element with respect
to hydrogen, G(Te, ne) is the contribution f unction
which contains all the atomic physics parameters, ne
and Te are the electron number density and tempera-
ture and nH is the hydrogen number density.

For the thermal analysis we need to know the electron
density distribution in the AR. One method of estimat-
ing the electron density is given by calculating the ra-
tio of two line intensities from the same ion, where at
least one involves a metastable level m. This make the
ratio density dependent, assuming the temperature of
the maximum of the ionization fraction of the ion. The
density is then inferred by matching the ratio derived
from observations with the theoretical value calculated
at diﬀerent densities. The results of this analysis are
presented in App. D.

To estimate the distribution of the plasma emis-
sion measure with the temperature, there are vari-
ous methods which diﬀer in the approximations ap-
plied. We introduce the column emission measure (EM,
Ivanov-Kholodnyi & Nikol’Skii 1963; Pottasch 1963)
along the line of sight l, as

EM =

nenHdl

Zl
If we assume that the emitting plasma along l is
isothermal at Tc and the electron density known (nc),
using Eq. 1 we can write

We also introduce the eﬀective temperature, which is

the DEM-weighted average:

(3)

If the density is unknown, a ﬁrst approximation test
on the temperature distribution of the plasma is given
by plotting EM(Te) as function of Te, for a set of lines
formed in a wide range of temperatures. This is called
the emission measure loci approach. A necessary con-
dition for the plasma to be isothermal is that these
curves cross at the plasma temperature. However, this
plot gives only an indication of the plasma distribution
as the uncertainties on the measures and data inver-
sion can introduce additional solutions to the inversion
(Guennou et al. 2012).

When a set of lines from optically thin plasma formed
at diﬀerent temperatures is available, the diﬀerential
emission measure (DEM) inversion is more appropriate
to probe the multi-thermal plasma. The DEM is pro-
portional to nenH (variable with Te) in the temperature
intervals dTe and it is deﬁned here as

DEM(Te) = nenH

The thermal analysis using these diagnostics is pre-

sented in Sec. 7.

For the diagnostic analysis in this work we used the
CHIANTI v.8 atomic database and software (Dere et al.
1997; Del Zanna et al. 2015a) to calculate the theoreti-
cal emissivities of the spectral lines. A particular case
was the treatment of Ca XIV 943.59 ˚A, which will be
discussed in Sec 6.

We adopted the CHIANTI default ionization equilib-
rium, and Feldman (1992) elemental abundances. This
latter choice was made after several tests we did chang-
ing element composition in the EM loci approach and
DEM inversions. Even if the eﬀect of composition on
the result is small, we found Feldman (1992) data to
produce the better observed versus theoretical ﬂuxes ra-
tio. We adopted a density of 109 cm−3 for the SUMER
slit in position 1 and 4 × 108 cm−3 for position 2 derived
from the analysis presented in Appendix D.

5. TEMPORAL VARIABILITY AND SUB-DATA

SELECTION

We ﬁrst made an investigation of the spatial and tem-
poral properties of the AR along the SUMER slit in the
hot lines. This has been useful to the selection of the
region of interest for detailed investigation. We mostly
used SUMER data, where the signal is strong.

5.1. Spatial structuring and temporal variability in hot

lines

Figure 3 shows the intensity of the SUMER Fe XVII
– XIX lines along the slit and for the sixty exposures
on April the 27th, slit position 1. From the top to the
bottom, they have been ordered following the time se-
quence of data acquisition. The plots have been satu-
rated to highlight the fainter structuring of the AR, and
the brightest regions in yellow correspond to the ﬂaring
areas (around Y = −230′′).

The Fe XVIII sequence shows a very bright area cor-
responding to the passage of a hot loop accross the slit
(this is the one used to co-align SUMER and EIS, see
also Figure 12 which is plotted using a diﬀerent con-
trast). At both its sides of the hot loop we can identify

faint structures whose ﬂux seems to remain almost con-
stant in time. This suggests that they are not aﬀected
much by the ﬂare. We highlight them in the Figure 3
by pairs of vertical lines (see also Table 3, masks A and
C). In line with our aim of investigating non-ﬂaring re-
gions, we selected these two area as candidates to pursue
our analysis. We also added a third region which was
taken as a sample of the unstructured emission (mask
B), which appears faint in all the plots of Figure 3. The
details of these masks are listed in Table 3. Some struc-
turing is still visible in the AR core.

A similar analysis has been carried out for the SUMER
slit position 2 and is reported in Annex E. Here we iden-
tiﬁed two other candidate regions for the thermal anal-
ysis.

The structuring of the AR in hot lines has been ex-
tracted by temporally averaging the exposures. Reduc-
ing the background noise thus makes it easier to see the
fainter regions (section 5.1.1). We also carried out a
temporal analysis of these regions to understand bet-
ter how much their ﬂux varies with the ﬂaring activity
(section 5.1.2).

Figure 3. SUMER Fe XVII, Fe XVIII and XIX intensities
along the slit in position 1, plotted for the sixty exposures
(with 75 seconds exposure time). The images have been
saturated to enhance the fainter emission at the side of the
ﬂare. The colour range represents, from top to bottom, 0-
99, 0-10, 0-40 counts/pixel. The three vertical pairs of yellow
lines mark the three masks A, B and C. The limb is on the
right side of the plots.

5.1.1. Spatial structuring

Figure 4 top shows the integrated intensity of the
Fe XVIII line proﬁle for the spectra averaged over the
sixty exposures, plotted along the SUMER slit in po-
sition 1 using one pixel spatial resolution. The north
is on the right of the plot. This ﬁgure shows well the
structuring of the AR. As in Figure 3, the data in the
range approximately Y= [-260′′, -190′′] are due to the
hot loop, while the vertical pairs of dashed lines mark
the three areas (masks) selected for the analysis.
Figure 4 bottom shows the same integrated intensities
for the SUMER Fe XVII, Fe XIX and Ca X. The latter is
used to represent the 1MK corona. The three Fe lines
are observed in three diﬀerent spectral windows, which
means that they are not co-temporal (only Ca X is co-
temporal to Fe XVII). Nontheless, the intense Fe XVII and
Fe XVIII lines have a similar pattern along the slit, which
highlights brighter structures and fainter areas. On the
other hand, the Fe XIX intensity outside the ﬂaring re-
gion is very weak and there is little we can say using the
intensity of a single pixel. In order to be able to use this
line, for each of the selected regions we have spatially av-
eraged the spectra. The three regions are marked by the
pairs of vertical dashed lines. Going from the bottom
of the slit towards the top, we ﬁnd mask A: this is one
of the faintest and most persistent structures in Fe XVII
and Fe XVIII. Mask B is located close to the slit cen-

Figure 4. Top: SUMER Fe XVIII intensity along the slit
integrated over the sixty exposures. The pairs of vertical
dashed lines mark the three areas selected for further anal-
ysis. Bottom: same as the top plot for Fe XVII, Fe XIX and
Ca X.

5.1.2. Temporal variability of the selected regions

To further investigate the temporal variability within
the selected regions, we spatially averaged the spectra
and kept some temporal resolution by averaging the
spectra over only ﬁve exposures (six for Fe XIX). For
example, Figure 5 shows the resulting light curves for
mask A and mask B. We compared these to light curves
of the AIA 94 channel for the same masks using data
integrated over 10 mins. The intensity has been cor-
rected for the cooler component contributing to AIA 94
has estimated using the 171 channel, as described in
Reale et al. (2011). For mask A, the hot component of
AIA 94 is almost stable up to the time of the ﬁrst ﬂare at
about 21UT (∼ 420 mins in the plot). This component is
mostly comparable to the SUMER Fe XVIII which, how-
ever, shows more variability. This line is blended with
the Si VIII 974.58 ˚A which has been removed. However
the signal in a single point is weak and it is possible that
some residuals of the Si line has aﬀected the light curve.

Note— The last two masks are used to test
blends (see Sec. 3.1) and perform the SUMER
wavelength calibration (described in Appendix
C).

Some temporal variability is also visible in the Fe XIX
which increases during the observations, while Fe XVII
seems to be only marginally aﬀected by the ﬂare. We
decided to keep this mask for our analysis and average
out the temporal variability by using an average spec-
trum.

Also mask B shows some variability, even though
Fe XIX is always absent. This mask is closer to the ﬂar-
ing activity which is clearly visible in the AIA 94 curve.
For this mask a signature is also visible in Fe XVII show-
ing a peak delayed with respect to the AIA one. We
used this mask by discarding the exposures of Fe XVII
which were aﬀected by the ﬂare.

In conclusion, this analysis shows that there is some
variability in time of the hot lines, but only in one case
can we see a clear link to the ﬂaring activity. We dis-
carded the aﬀected exposures. To average out the tem-
poral variability and increase the signal to noise of the
data, we pursued the analysis on these masks by averag-
ing the spectra over all the exposures, as shown in Figure
4 and 17. From these ﬁgures we see that the selected
structures (apart from mask E), stay stable during the
whole period of the observations (that is the time delay
between observing Fe XVII and Fe XVIII).

6. SUMER-EIS CROSS CALIBRATION

The analysis carried out using integrated ﬂuxes de-
rived from diﬀerent instruments could introduce incon-
sistencies due to the absolute radiometric calibrations.
We carried out tests using the EM loci method on the
Ca and Fe lines and found several issues that we had

to solve. We used the data from some of the selected
masks to address the problem.

6.1. Consistency in the EIS data

In addition to the pre-ﬂight analysis (Lang et al.
2006), the absolute radiometric calibration of EIS has
been investigated post-launch by Del Zanna (2013a),
GDZ, and Warren et al. (2014), NRL. These last two
introduce a diﬀerent correction factor to the pre-ﬂight
calibration which, for the period of our observations, can
reach a factor of 2.4 (see Figure 18 and Warren et al.
(2014)). These diﬀerences have to be taken into account
in the analysis of the data. All three calibrations are
available in the SolarSof t.

Figure 6 shows the EM loci for the EIS data of mask
A. There is consistency between the two results (GDZ
and NRL), even though the use of the GDZ calibra-
tion results in larger EMs than in the NRL case, with a
slightly lower peak temperature. In the following anal-
ysis we have used the GDZ calibration.

6.2. Consistency in the SUMER data

Figure 7 shows the EM loci for the SUMER data for
mask A, obtained by using the lines having a formation
temperature close to the peak of the emission measure.
From this set, only the high temperature lines will be
retained for the thermal analysis presented in Section 7.
The EM peak is around log T = 6.4, which is typical
of ARs. Also we note that the Ca XIV loci plotted with
the solid curved (CHIANTI v.8) is inconsistent with the
rest of the curves, being it too high. Having investigated
the problem, we found this to be an atomic data issue
rather then a wrong choice of element abundances: the

HOT PLASMA IN A LIMB ACTIVE REGION

The Ca XIV forbidden line observed by SUMER at
943.58 ˚A is the strongest line within the ground conﬁgu-
ration of this ion, between the ground state 2s2 2p3 4S3/2
and the ﬁrst excited level, the 2s2 2p3 2D3/2. The ex-
citation data in CHIANTI v.8 are from Landi & Bhatia
(2005), and were calculated with the distorted wave
(DW) approximation.
It is well known that this ap-
proximation works very well for strong dipole-allowed
transition, but typically underestimates the electron ex-
citation rates of the forbidden lines, especially within
the ground conﬁguration. This was conﬁrmed by a re-
cent R-matrix calculation by Dong et al. (2012), where
signiﬁcant increases in several transitions rates were re-
ported. The excitation rate for the 943.58 ˚A forbid-
den transition is about a factor of two higher with the
Dong et al. calculations. We have taken the Dong et al.
excitation rates and built a new CHIANTI model ion
to be used for the present analysis. We supplemented
these data with A-values from the recent calculations by
Wang et al. (2016). The ratio with the strongest line,
the resonance EUV line at 193.87 ˚A observed with Hin-
ode EIS, is slightly temperature sensitive, but does not
vary much with electron density. At log T [K]=6.4, the
ratio between these two lines is a factor of 1.73 higher
with the new model ion, which is signiﬁcant.

The loci obtained with this new model is plotted as a
dashed line in Figure 7, where it has become consistent
with the ensemble of the curves.

and B for slit position 1 compared to the AIA 94 corrected

calculation (dashed curve).

served one.

6.3. Combining EIS and SUMER data

When we plotted the EM locis from the two instru-
ments together for the diﬀerent masks, we found a sys-
tematic diﬀerence: at similar temperatures the SUMER

12

Parenti et al.

emission measures were lower than the EIS ones. For in-
stance, this is the case for two lines from Ca XIV. We as-
sumed this discrepancy was due to the SUMER degrada-
tion, discussed by Teriaca et al. (2012). We then made
tests to calculate a correction factor to be applied to the
SUMER ﬂuxes. The correction factor can be obtained
using data from an isothermal plasma, by comparing the
measured to the theoretical lines ratio predicted by the
CHIANTI database at the given temperature.

While a detailed discussion on the EM loci analysis
will be given in the next section, here we just mention
that the curves from the selected masks are all similar
around the peak located between log T = 6.4 − 6.5. For
our lines ratio analysis we selected the temperature ob-
tained in mask B, as it is the one where the Fe XIX is
absent. This means that most of the Ca line emission
is formed close to the EM peak temperature. Assuming
this plasma temperature, we obtained a SUMER correc-
tion factor 1.8 using the GDZ EIS calibration (that is
consistent with the expected degradation of the instru-
ment performances estimated by Teriaca et al. (2012)).
We also carried out the same analysis using the NRL
EIS calibration and found a factor 1.4. For the follow-
ing thermal analysis we used the GDZ factor.

7. THERMAL ANALYSIS

This section presents the results from the thermal

analysis using diﬀerent DEM and EM methods.

7.1. EM Loci

Figure 8 shows the combined EIS and corrected
SUMER loci EMs for the selected masks for, SUMER
slit position 1 (top and middle lines) and 2 (bottom
line).

As already pointed out, there are similarities between
these plots which all show the bulk of plasma at about
3 MK; which is a well known result (e.i. Parenti et al.
(2010)). Additionally, the decrease of the EM is notice-
able with the increase in solar height. The diﬀerence
between them is mainly found in the absence of Fe XIX
for mask B (in the ﬁgure we plotted an upper limit used
for the DEM analysis). The cooler emission for this re-
gion might be representative of background AR plasma.
This ﬁrst analysis suggests a new result: from above
the limb to about 91 Mm and over about 1.5 × 102 Mm
across the AR, the thermal properties above 3 MK are
similar almost everywhere.

For the region covered by the mask C we can also
provide temporal information, because this is the only
mask that could be applied to both EIS rasters in posi-
tion 1. The EM loci plots for this mask are shown in the
middle row of Figure 8. Only the EIS curves can show

diﬀerences (for both masks we used the same SUMER
data). We see no signiﬁcant change, so we conclude that
the EM loci plots do not show evidence of spatial and
temporal variations.

7.2. Diﬀerential emission measure

The DEM vs T curves (see Eq. 4) have been ob-
tained with a method based on a simple chi-square
minimization. We essentially used a modiﬁed version
of the xrt dem iterative2.pro DEM inversion routine
(Weber et al. 2004) in order to have more ﬂexibility
in the choice of input parameters. The standard rou-
tine, widely used in solar physics and available within
SolarSof t, is based on the robust chi-square ﬁtting rou-
tine (mpﬁt.pro). The DEM is modelled assuming a
spline, with a ﬁxed selection of the nodes. Since it turns
out that the DEM solutions are quite sensitive to the
choice of nodes, we modiﬁed the program to allow for
the deﬁnition of the number and location of the spline
nodes. We also introduced the option to input minimum
and maximum limits to the DEM spline values, which
are passed to (mpﬁt.pro). This was found to be par-
ticularly useful for constraining the upper limits of the
highest temperature values. We used upper limits for
the DEM values which provide radiances in the Fe XIX
and Fe XXIII lines as given in Sec. 3.2.

Figure 9 shows the results from this inversion. The
top plot shows the resulting DEM for mask A, overplot-
ted with the points at the temperature of the maximum
of the G(T), which represent the theoretical vs. the ob-
served intensity ratio multiplied by the DEM value. The
bottom plot contains all the masks together.

The temperature range for the inversion has been set
to log T [K]=5.6 – 7.2. For all the DEM inversions we
selected spline nodes at log T [K]= 5.6, 5.8, 5.95, 6.2,
6.35, 6.45, 6.55, 6.8, 7.2, which provide relatively good
agreement (within 20–30%) between predicted and ob-
served intensities, as shown in Table 4. The resulting
DEM values are relatively smooth. Adding a few ex-
tra spline nodes in the 1–3 MK range can improve the
agreement between observed and predicted intensities,
but the DEM would be less smooth (as found for in-
stance by Landi & Feldman (2008)).

Consistency was found between these results and the
EM loci approach, the DEM curves are similar for all the
masks. As expected, there is a decrease in amplitude of
the DEM with an increase in the solar height. Some
diﬀerences are found, but only at high temperatures.

The 1 − 2.5 MK corona is represented by a double-
peaked DEM. The hotter peak is at around 2.5 MK and
it is higher that the cooler peak for mask A, C and E.
The 3 MK peak of the DEM of the oﬀ-limb corona is

rasters with the same coordinates.
already known in literature (Reale 2014). What is most
interesting is the plateau above 5 MK due to the obser-
vation of the high temperature lines. The DEM values
at the main peak are so high that the eﬀective tempera-
ture of emission for lines such as Fe XVII and Fe XVIII is
about 3 MK, i.e. these lines are mainly formed far away
from their peak formation temperatures (5 and 7 MK
respectively using the CHIANTI v.8 charge state dis-
tributions in ionization equilibrium). This issue is quite

typical for active regions, as described e.g. in Del Zanna
(2013b) and Del Zanna & Mason (2014). The peak at
2.5 MK is very well constrained by the Fe XVI and Ca
XIV lines. The fact that the DEM values around 3 MK
are suﬃcient to explain the intensity of the Fe XVII and
Fe XVIII lines means that the DEM above 3 MK has to
drop signiﬁcantly by several orders of magnitude. How-
ever, whenever the Fe XIX line is observed, its intensity
requires a plateau in the DEM.

14

Parenti et al.

A further constrain at higher temperatures comes
from the fact that the EIS Fe XXIII 263.75 ˚A is not ob-
served (we note that weak unidentiﬁed lines are present
in active region EIS spectra, close to this line). We mea-
sured the variation of the EIS background near the line
to estimate a 3 σ value for the intensity of this line, as
described in Sec. 3.2. We put an upper limit at log
T [K]= 7.2 accordingly (the reason why the DEM in-
creases slightly above 10 MK). From Table 4 we see
that we have been quite conservative in choosing 3 σ, as
the ﬂux ratios between theoretical and measured values
are well below 1.

The 10 MK DEM is about 103 times smaller than
the 2.5 MK peak, and even less for the cooler mask B
(here the Fe XIX is not visible). This presence of very
hot plasma has already been identiﬁed in some areas of
ARs. Here we are able to extend our knowledge: this
very hot plasma seems to be in all locations where we
have a structured AR, with emission in the Fe XVIII
line, and it appears also to be persistent with time (at
least within our observation time). In fact, the bottom
of Figure 9 tells us that there is a temporal variation
of the DEM above the 3 MK between masks C1 and
C2. This is the area very close to the limb and probably
subjected to more AR variability. However, the 10 MK
DEM is not aﬀected.

7.3. Emission measure

Figure 10 top-left shows the emission measure (solid-
blue line) for mask A obtained by integrating the DEM
of Figure 9 over a temperature bin of size 0.2 (in loga-
rithm scale). In the Figure we also overplotted the EM
resulting from 200 inversions by the DEM code, by ran-
domly varying each ﬂux within 20%. These are shown as
a light gray cloud of solutions within each temperature
bin. The bin size d log T = 0.2 is a good compromise to
maximize the temperature resolution and to minimize
the spread of the solutions within each temperature bin.
The degradation of the solution with a smaller temper-
ature bin is illustrated by the bottom-right plot of this
ﬁgure.

We compared this calculation with the EM derived
applying a diﬀerent method. We used the Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) diﬀerential emission
measure algorithm distributed with the P IN T of ALE
(Kashyap & Drake 1998, 2000; Drake & Kashyap 2010)
spectral analysis package testing diﬀerent input param-
eters.

With respect to several other methods, the MCMC
method has the advantage of not imposing a predeter-
mined functional form for the solution, and, most impor-
tantly, it provides conﬁdence limits on the most probable

Figure 9. Top: Results from the DEM inversion for position

intensity ratio multiplied by the DEM value. Bottom: The

DEM, thus allowing a determination of the signiﬁcance
of apparent structures that may be found in a typical
reconstruction. The algorithm assumes that the uncer-
tainties in the intensities are uncorrelated so that sys-
tematic errors in the calibration, which could depend on
the wavelength, or in the atomic data, which could vary
by ion, are not accounted for. The code has been set
to perform 200 explorations (batches) of the parameter
space, and 200 Monte Carlo realizations for each ex-
ploration. Figure 10 top-right shows the resulting EM
from this method applying the same parameters of the
left plot. In a similar way, Figure 11 shows the MCMC
EM for mask B (red line) with the cloud of solutions.
The EM obtained from the DEM applying the chi-square
minimization method (presented in Sec. 7.2) is overplot-
ted in blue.

As seen in Sec. 7.2, the plasma distribution is domi-
nated by a main peak around 3MK, followed by a drastic

HOT PLASMA IN A LIMB ACTIVE REGION

15

drop of the EM at high temperature. Overall, in the in-
terval 6.5 < log T < 7 the EM looks to drop more (by
about one order of magnitude) in mask B than in mask
A.

When we compare the solutions for one mask for the
two methods, we see that they are consistent in most
temperature bins. More discrepancies are found at low
temperature, where the inversion is less constrained, and
for the log T = 6.8 bin. In general the high temperature
tail drops more rapidly with the ﬁrst method.

As mentioned, to better constrain the solutions we
decided to adopt a binsize of log T = 0.2, as a smaller
one produces solutions with greater dispersion in each
temperature bin. This is shown for instance for mask A
in Figure 10 bottom right. We checked the eﬀect of ex-
tending the temperature range to higher values for those
masks where the Fe XXIII was used as upper limit. This
is a ﬂare line whose temperature of formation extends
beyond 10 MK. This inversion is shown for mask A in
Figure 10 bottom left. We see again that at high tem-
perature the solutions in each bin spans a larger interval.

7.4. High temperature tail of the EM

The diﬀerent thermal analysis methods presented here
converge in ﬁnding the well know peak of emission mea-
sure at around 3 MK.
In addition, the long integra-
tion time and the low noise level of SUMER have re-
vealed the persistent presence of a small amount of very
hot plasma. The DEM is very similar everywhere sug-
gesting common heating process at work. The amount
of very hot plasma has been quantiﬁed with an EM
which reaches at maximum about 0.1% at 10 MK of
the main EM peak value. Such a small ratio was pre-
viously found in on disk and limb quiescent ARs us-
ing soft (Reale et al. 2009a; Del Zanna & Mason 2014)
and hard X-ray (Miceli et al. 2012; Hannah et al. 2016)
data. This ratio is also consistent with Parenti et al.
(2010) ﬁndings on the averaged EM in a pre-ﬂaring area
using the HINODE/XRT hard ﬁlter ratio. As presented
in Sec. 1, a few other X-ray measurements found about
only two orders of magnitude variation of the EM in the
3 − 10 MK (e.g. Reale et al. 2009b; Testa et al. 2011).
To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst time the EM above
5 MK has been quantiﬁed over three orders of magni-
tude in an oﬀ-limb AR observation by using measured
lines proﬁle from EUV spectroscopic data.

The spatial distribution in an AR of Fe XIX from on
disk observations was reported by Brosius et al. (2014)
using the EUNIS-13 sounding rocket. They found a Fe
XIX /Fe XII emission measure ratios (assuming a tem-
perature formation of ≈ 8.9 MK and ≈ 1.6 MK, re-
spectively) of ≈ 0.59 in the AR core, ≈ 0.076 in the

outer part, while they established a limit of 0.0081 in a
quiescent area. For our data this ratio is below 0.005,
depending on the mask. Our upper limit is found for
mask C1 (from a well detected Fe XIX line) and it is
close to their upper limit for Fe XIX. Our lower values
for this ratio are probably due to a diﬀerent line-of-sight
integration path, suggesting that the most intense hot
plasma is concentrated lower down in the corona.

We also made a linear ﬁt to the logarithm of the EM
to establish the power law index above the EM peak,
which can be compared to other published results. We
have to remember that other results suggest a diﬀer-
ent EM proﬁle at these temperatures with possibly a
secondary small peak around 10 MK (e.g. Reale et al.
2009b; Shestov et al. 2010; Sylwester et al. 2010). For
the ﬁtting we set the temperature range between 2.5 and
10 MK. Table 5 summarizes our results and lists other
ﬁnding from the literature. For our work we used data
from mask A and B, as representative of our dataset, as
we can see from Figure 9.

Table 5 lists quite diﬀerent values of the power law
index. Contrary to mask A, our mask B results are
quite uncertain due to the diﬀerent solutions found us-
ing the two inversion methods. As a general trend, we
have the impression that the oﬀ-disk slopes are shallower
than on disk and limb data. However, several elements
linked to the inversion method could aﬀect this, such
as: the inversion method constraints, the temperature
bin, the temperature range, the upper limit of the data.
Some of these eﬀects have been shown in Figure 10. For
instance, if we were using a smaller temperature bin,
our EM solutions would spread more in a way to give
steeper slopes. We have also discussed the diﬀerences
between the NRL and GDZ EIS ﬂux calibrations. The
use of the NRL calibration would probably produce a
lower EM peak value at higher temperatures. The EM
slope could be diﬀerent. This is because the two cali-
brations do not have the same wavelength dependence
(see Figure 18 and Figure 6). The EM peak is deﬁned
by the Fe XV, Fe XVI and Ca XIV which fall in diﬀerent
parts of the spectra.

From the physical point of view, in the case of the
same heating mechanism being common to all ARs, it is
also possible that changes may occur with the age of the
AR, aﬀecting the EM shape in time (Miceli et al. 2012;
Ko et al. 2016). This is a very interesting topic that
needs further investigation. Diﬀerent heating mecha-
nisms acting on ARs should leave, eventually, diﬀerent
signatures in the DEM. For instance, for those results
suggesting a secondary peak around 8 − 10 MK, this
could be explained by a secondary population of ﬂare-
like events with diﬀerent initial energy and frequency

from the one populating the bulk of the DEM (e.g.
Argiroﬃ et al. 2008).

However, the uncertainties on the measures are very
high and a clear statement cannot be given yet. Fi-
nally, we have to remember that all these measures are
taken through diﬀerent line of sights integration, which
results in weighted emission measure information.
In
our case we have seen that the < 1 MK (the Ca X in
Figure 4) plasma has a diﬀerent morphology than the
hot plasma. Certainly we are crossing diﬀerent bundles
of loops along the line of sight. And it is possible that
we are in presence of independent populations of plasma,
heated through a diﬀerent process, one of which main-
tains the plasma at high temperature. In the absence of
further simulation tests, we leave this option open.

With our results we think to have provided further im-
portant observational constraints on AR heating. The
hottest plasma is probably concentrated in the low ly-
ing part of the AR core, however its presence in small

amount in the upper part of loops suggests a continuous
energy injection also at these heights. Considering that
the cooling timescales of a 10MK plasma in equilibrium
conditions is of the order of minutes, the temporal per-
sistence of such temperatures also imposes constraints
on the way each spatial area (our masks) is heated. In
the nanoﬂares scenario, the frequency of heating in the
area covered by each of our masks should be higher than
such a timescale.

8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have described the analysis of oﬀ-
limb observations of AR 11459 observed on the 27th
and 28th of April 2012 with both the SUMER and EIS
spectrometers. This, to our knowledge, is the ﬁrst study
addressing the thermal analysis of oﬀ-limb observations
of an AR with spectroscopic constraints up to 10MK,
given by the observation of the Fe XIX spectral line.

Note—In the ﬁrst two columns we list the dominant contribution to the observed spectral
lines. Note that the Fe X 257.26 ˚A is a self-blend of two transitions. As an indication of
where the lines mainly form, we list in column 3 the log Teﬀ [K] values for the mask A. Values
in parentheses are the ratios obtained from the MCMC program using a temperature bin of
log T = 0.2 and a maximum temperature of log T = 7.2. The ∗ marks the imposed upper limit.

After preparation of the data, we have provided the
spatial distribution of the hot lines emitted above 3 MK
along the SUMER slit. We also investigated the light
curves for selected areas. One initial result is that the in-
tensity distribution along the slit of Ca X (log T max =
5.9) does not follow the spatial distribution of hot lines
(Fe XVII in this case) observed at the same time. This
suggests we are looking to diﬀerent thermal structures
along the line of sight.

As we are sensitive to the issue of ﬂare contamination
in our data, we also checked this aspect. Parenti et al.
(2010) investigated the eﬀect of a ﬂare on the neighbor-
ing loops. That ﬂare had a similar intensity (class C)
to those arising during our observations. Parenti et al.
(2010) found the ﬂare to have a little eﬀect on the EM
time evolution of the individual neighboring loops, even
though these had a footpoint location in common with
the ﬂaring loops. This seems not to be the situation in
our case, which reassures us about the inﬂuence on the
EM of the small ﬂares happening during our observa-
tions. To cross check, we analyzed the light curves of

the hot lines and we excluded those datasets that may
have been aﬀected.

We then selected diﬀerent masks, and we spatially and
temporally averaged the data in each of them to increase
the signal to noise ratio and minimize any temporal
change.
In particular, our Fe XIX could be measured
only after these procedures, suggesting that there was
only a small amount of very hot plasma.

We performed EM and DEM analyses, optimizing the
inversion parameters to minimize the spread of the solu-
tions. We found consistent results with previous work:
we conﬁrm a small hot component up to 10 MK.
In
addition we were able to further extend our knowledge
of this very hot component.

In conclusion we can summarize our results as follows:

• Very hot plasma (above 3MK) is present and per-
sistent almost everywhere in the oﬀ-limb observa-
tions of the AR. In particular, we measure this
up to at least 9.1 Mm above the limb and for
1.5 × 102 Mm across the AR.

• Apart from a cooler region (mask B), we found
very similar DEM distributions for the diﬀerent
masks. In the hottest regions we found an EM of
about 0.1% at 10 MK with respect to the bulk of
the plasma at 3 MK . In spite of a factor of about
2 diﬀerence in the peak of the EM (constrained
by the EIS long wavelengths lines) between the
GDZ and NRL EIS radiometric calibrations, this

main result still stands. We stress that these mea-
surements were possible only using spatially and
temporally averaged deep exposures.

• It is interesting to see the consistency of the re-
sults for Fe XVII - XVIII - XIX listed in Table 4,
considering that the SUMER observations lasted
over 17 hours.
In our analysis this implies that
the above ratio, on average, does not change with
time. Our data do not allow us to say anything
further concerning shorter time scales.

• The similarity within the AR in the thermal prop-
erties of the diﬀerent masks is accompanied to
both the presence (masks E) or not (masks A−D)
of spatial changes observed in the hot lines during
few hours time.

• The detection of a persistent Fe XIX line in one of
the analyzed regions determined a shallower trend
in the hot side of the EM distribution. We ﬁt-
ted the high temperature tail of the EM with a
single power law and found a power law index be-
tween -4 and -5 in that region (mask A), depending
on the inversion method used. This is less steep
than other values found previously, but we found
a steeper trend in other regions (between -5 and
-9). Although this puts constraints on the possible
presence of an impulsive heating component, the
resolution is not good enough to ascertain whether
the shallow trend is really monotonic or we might

have another minor peak around 107 K, so this as-
pect deserves further investigation. We also note
that the EIS NRL and GDZ radiometric calibra-
tions can result in somewhat diﬀerent values for
the slopes.

• We provide a new Ca XIV 943.59 ˚A atomic model
which replaces that included in the CHIANTI v.
8. This new data increases the intensity of the line
and gives consistent EM results compared to other
lines formed at similar temperatures.

• We provide SUMER-EIS cross calibration for the
period of our observations. We found the SUMER
intensities to be a factor 1.8 lower the EIS one
when using the GDZ calibration, and 1.4 when
using the NRL calibration. Previous work us-
ing data and calibrations from diﬀerent periods
found factors 1.5 and 1.2 (Giunta et al. 2012;
Landi & Young 2010), suggesting that the rela-
tive calibration of the two instruments has not
changed much with time.

We conclude by suggesting that we have reached
the limit of the EUV diagnostics possibilities for this
topic. We encourage spatially resolved X-ray and multi-
waveband systematic observations as the next step. New
high sensitivity X-ray spectroscopic instruments should
also be proposed for the next generation of missions.
Our analysis has been carried out assuming ionization
equilibrium, as suggested by the relatively high electron
density derived by our data. However, further investiga-

tion on this topic will be considered in our future work.

APPENDIX

A. COALIGNMENT

For the ﬁrst slit position, we found that the best way to proceed was to use the temporal sequence of SUMER
exposures which shows a strong emission in Fe XVIII, corresponding to the passage of a post-ﬂare loop across the slit,
as shown in Figure 12.

The SUMER sub-time and sub-spatial sequence selected is shown in Figure 12 bottom (the solar limb is on the right
side of the image). The SUMER slit is not aligned to the AIA image columns, as the SOHO spacescraft was rolled
with respect to SDO. Moreover the spatial resolution of the two instruments is not the same. We took into account of
these elements and proceeded to follow the steps detailed here. We ﬁrst selected an AIA data cube co-temporal to the
time series of SUMER. The data cube was rotated by the SOHO roll amount in order to have the AIA image’s columns
aligned N-S with the SUMER slit, we then selected a subﬁeld and we spatially binned to the SUMER spatial pixel.
We then had AIA subﬁeld images comparable to the SUMER exposures. At a given time, each spatial column of the
AIA-subﬁeld was cross-correlated with the corresponding SUMER exposure. The best solution for the coalignment is
given by the AIA column which maximizes the correlation in time and space, as shown in Figure 12 top.

To co-align EIS with AIA we chose to use the AIA 195 and EIS Fe XII 192.394 ˚A, as there is no Fe XVIII in EIS and
the Fe XVII lines are too faint to be used. We proceeded by selecting a cube of AIA images co-temporal to the EIS
raster sub-ﬁeld close to the limb (see Figure 13). We built an AIA raster cube, each column made of data taken at
the equivalent EIS exposure time. The other two dimensions were ﬁlled by columns of the same image taken across a

20

Parenti et al.

spatial lag of about 10 pixels, with steps of one. This method allowed us to extract the best correlation for the whole
sub-raster in space and time. The AIA subﬁeld which gave the best coalignment result is plotted in Figure 13.

Figure 12. Top: AIA 94 channel intensity along the SUMER slit (x-axes in the ﬁgure) as function of exposure number (y-axes
in the ﬁgure). This is the best solution for the co-alignement. Bottom: Similar to the top plot, but for SUMER Fe XVIII 974.86
˚A. Note that the plot does not include the pause between each couple of exposures. The solar limb is on the right side of the
image.

B. SUMER STRAY LIGHT

Due to our interest in the hot emission, we estimated the stray light by using the AIA 94 channel data convolved
with the SUMER point spread function. The reference image was the integration of two AIA 94 images taken on the
27 April 2012 at 21:42 UT. This resulting image, binned to the SUMER pixel size, was convolved with the instrumental
proﬁle (P. Lemaire, private communicaton) as shown in Figure 14 left. On the right plot of Figure 14 we show the
horizontal cut (marked by the white line) on this image, scaled to the original AIA image, which crosses the active
region and the SUMER ﬁeld of view. We see that the oﬀ-limb stray light is only few percent of the original ﬂux.
We also tested stray light in cool lines. Our data also contain the O I 1152.15 ˚A which is a good stray-light marker
close to the limb. We integrated over the 60 exposures and extracted the line intensity along the SUMER slit position
2 in those pixels where the SNR is above 10. Assuming that the observed intensity is only due to scattered light in
the instrument, we calculated its ratio to the solar value (Curdt et al. 2004; Parenti et al. 2004, 2005), and found that
it is always below 3%.

C. SUMER WAVELENGTH CALIBRATION

SUMER spectra are not wavelength calibrated and the grating dispersion is wavelength dependent.

Ideally, to
perform the calibration we need to have reference lines proﬁles (that are emitted by static features) along the whole
waveband. The process is quite straightforward once we have observations targeting the quiet Sun: the SUMER

wavebands include a long list of chromospheric lines, including neutrals or singly ionized ions, for which we assume a
mean zero velocity (see details of this calibration in Parenti et al. (2004)). This is not the case when we are dealing
with oﬀ-limb observations in active regions, where the coronal emission dominates, and plasma ﬂows are more common.
We tried to minimize the eﬀects of possible local ﬂows applying the following two steps. We used the data from the
slit positioned further out in the corona (position 2, mask G), averaging the spectra over seventy pixels in the southern
part of the slit (that is the area at the greatest distance and in the AR periphery). To produce an average eﬀect
which minimizes the detection of ﬂows, we chose as reference lines all the bright ones, independently of their formation

temperature. Because of the wavelength dependence of the dispersion, we performed an independent calibration in
our three spectral windows. We proceeded by measuring the position of our spectral lines in the pixel dimension on
the detector, and used a linear relation and reference positions to convert it in the wavelength space.

UT).

We derived the electron density maps from the EIS rasters using the electron density diagnostics of lines ratio
described in Section 4. We used Fe XIII (203.82 + 203.8)/202.04 ˚A (log T = 6.25), which is sensitive in the range
N > 108 cm−3. Figure 15 shows the density map from the raster starting at 20:24 UT on April the 27th (SUMER slit
position 1). The density along the SUMER slit derived from this map is shown in the central panel of Figure 16. For

HOT PLASMA IN A LIMB ACTIVE REGION

23

SUMER slit position 1 we also have an earlier EIS map and the density proﬁle along the SUMER slit is shown on the
left of Figure 16. The right plot in this ﬁgure gives the density derived along the SUMER slit for slit position 2.

The two proﬁles on SUMER position 1 reﬂect the changing of the structuring of the AR at this temperature about
two hours apart. We can identify the same main features with a change in the relative density amplitude, which is
most evident in the AR core (−250′′ < Y < −200′′). This area is the one occupied by the ﬂaring region and by the
hot loop visible in the ﬁrst raster (Figure 12). Note how little these proﬁles resemble the intensity proﬁles along the
slit of the hot lines, suggesting we are observing diﬀerent thermal structures along the line of sight. Figure 16 right
shows a more important drop in density as Y decreases, due both the increase height above the active region and the
increasing distance from the AR core.

The density values found here have been used for the thermal analysis.

apart. There is a temporal variation mostly in the core of the AR. We adapted our masks to these changes. As shown
in Figure 9 there is no thermal variation within at these locations.

Figure 18 shows the correction factor to the pre-ﬂight radiometric calibration of EIS for the two channels, as
determined by Del Zanna (2013a) (solid line) and Warren et al. (2014) (dashed line) for the period of our observations.
