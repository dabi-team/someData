ON STABLE MAPS OF OPERATOR ALGEBRAS

G.K. ELEFTHERAKIS

Abstract. We deﬁne a strong Morita-type equivalence ∼σ∆ for operator
algebras. We prove that A ∼σ∆ B if and only if A and B are stably
isomorphic. We also deﬁne a relation ⊂σ∆ for operator algebras. We
prove that if A and B are C∗-algebras, then A ⊂σ∆ B if and only if there
exists an onto ∗-homomorphism θ : B ⊗ K → A ⊗ K, where K is the set
of compact operators acting on an inﬁnite dimensional separable Hilbert
space. Furthermore, we prove that if A and B are C∗-algebras such that
A ⊂σ∆ B and B ⊂σ∆ A, then there exist projections r, ˆr in the centers of
A∗∗ and B∗∗, respectively, such that Ar ∼σ∆ Bˆr and A(idA∗∗ − r) ∼σ∆
B(idB∗∗ − ˆr).

1. Introduction

Two operator algebras A and B are called stably isomorphic if the alge-
bras A ⊗ K and B ⊗ K are isomorphic as operator algebras. Here, K is the
set of compact operators acting on l2(N). Stably isomorphic C ∗-algebras are
strongly Morita equivalent in the sense of Rieﬀel. The same is true of non-
self-adjoint operator algebras if we consider the strong Morita equivalence
that was introduced by Blecher, Muhly, and Paulsen in [2]. Meanwhile, the
converse is not true, even in the case of C ∗-algebras [4].

We introduce a new Morita type equivalence between operator algebras:
Let A and B be operator algebras that are possibly non-self-adjoint. We say
that A and B are σ−strongly ∆-equivalent, and write A ∼σ∆ B, if there exist
completely isometric homomorphisms α : A → α(A), β : B → β(B) and a
σ-ternary ring of operators M such that

(1.1)

α(A) = [M ∗β(B)M]

k·k

, β(B) = [Mα(A)M ∗]

.

See the deﬁnition of the σ−ternary ring of operators in Deﬁnition 2.1.

In the proof of [9, Theorem 3.2], see also [9, Lemma 3.4], we noticed that
if A, B are operator algebras possessing countable approximate identities, M
is a ternary ring of operators and the triple (A, B, M) satisﬁes (1.1) then M

is necessarily a σ−ternary ring of operators. We used this fact in order to
prove that A and B are stably isomorphic. Subsequently in [11, Theorem 4.6]
we extended the proof in the case of operator spaces. In the present paper,
we prove that ∼σ∆ is an equivalence relation in the class of operator algebras
and we use this fact to prove that A ∼σ∆ B if and only if A and B are stably
isomorphic.

In [9], we studied the relationship between A and B when (1.1) holds for
a ternary ring (TRO) of operators M that is not necessarily a σ-TRO. This
relation is not equivalent to the existence of an operator algebra isomorphism
between A ⊗ K and B ⊗ K.

We also consider a weaker relation ⊂σ∆ between operator algebras: We
say that A, σ∆-embeds into B if there exists a projection p in the center of
∆(B∗∗), where ∆(B∗∗) is the diagonal of the second dual operator algebra of
B, such that pBp is an operator algebra and A ∼σ∆ pBp. In this case, we
write A ⊂σ∆ B. We prove that ⊂σ∆ is transitive. For the case of C ∗-algebras,
we prove that A ⊂σ∆ B if and only if there exists an onto ∗-homomorphism
from B ⊗ K onto A ⊗ K, which is true if and only if there exists an ideal I of
B such that A ∼σ∆ B/I.

We investigate whether it is true that A ∼σ∆ B if A ⊂σ∆ B and B ⊂σ∆ A.
In general, this is not true (see Section 5). It is also not true even in the case
of C ∗- algebras (see Example 4.9). However, we prove that if A and B are
C ∗-algebras such that A ⊂σ∆ B and B ⊂σ∆ A, then there exist projections
r, ˆr in the centers of A∗∗ and B∗∗, respectively, such that Ar ∼σ∆ Bˆr and
A(idA∗∗ − r) ∼σ∆ B(idB∗∗ − ˆr). A dual version of the results obtained in this
article can be found in [10].

In the following we describe the notations and symbols used in this paper.
If H, K are Hilbert spaces, then B(H, K) is the space of bounded operators
from H to K. We write B(H) for B(H, H). A ternary ring of operators (TRO)
is a subspace of some B(H, K) satisfying MM ∗M ⊆ M (see the deﬁnition
of a σ-TRO in Deﬁnition 2.1). An operator algebra is an operator space and
Banach algebra for which there exists a completely isometric homomorphism
α : A → B(H). In this article, when we consider an operator algebra, we
mean an operator algebra with a contractive approximate identity. We note
that C ∗-algebras possess contractive approximate identities automatically. If
X is an operator space, then M∞(X) is the set of ∞ × ∞ matrices whose
ﬁnite submatrices have uniformly bounded norm. The space M∞(X) is an
operator space. In addition, M f in
∞ (X) will denote the subspace of M∞(X)
consisting of ”ﬁnitely supported matrices.” We write K∞(X) for the norm
closure in M∞(X) of M f in
∞ (X). It is well-known that the space K∞(X) is
completely isometric isomorphic with X ⊗ K, where ⊗ is the minimal tensor

product [1]. For further details on the operator space theory that is used in
this paper, we refer the reader to the books by [1], [6], [12], and [13].

A nest N ⊆ B(H) is a totally ordered set of orthogonal projections contain-
ing the zero and identity operators that are closed under arbitrary suprema
and inﬁma. Given a nest N ⊆ B(H), by Alg(N ) we denote the corresponding
nest algebra:

{x ∈ B(H) : (IH − n)xn = 0, ∀ n ∈ N }.

Given an operator algebra A, we denote its center by Z(A) and its diagonal
A ∩ A∗ by ∆(A). If S is a subset of a vector space, then we denote the linear
span of the elements of S by [S].

2. Preliminaries

prove that ∼σ∆ is an equivalence relation in Section 3.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let H, K be Hilbert spaces, and M ⊆ B(H, K) be a norm

3. σ-strong ∆-equivalence

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let A and B be operator algebras acting on the Hilbert spaces
H and L, respectively. We call them σ-strongly T RO-equivalent if there exists
a σ-TRO M ⊆ B(L, H) such that

A = [M ∗BM]

k·k

, B = [MAM ∗]

k·k

.

In this case, we write A ∼σT RO B.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let A and B be operator algebras. We call these σ-strongly
∆-equivalent if there exist completely isometric homomorphisms α : A →
α(A), β : B → β(B) such that α(A) ∼σT RO β(B). In this case, we write
A ∼σ∆ B.

Theorem 3.1. Let A, B be σ-strongly ∆-equivalent operator algebras. Then,
for every completely isometric homomorphism α : A → α(A) there exists a
completely isometric homomorphism β : B → β(B) such that α(A) ∼σT RO
β(B).

Proof. We may assume that H, L, M are as in Deﬁnition 3.1. By Y , we denote
the space Y = [BMA]
. Let K be the A-balanced Haagerup tensor product
K = Y ⊗h

A H. This is a Hilbert space [2]. Deﬁne

k·k

β : B → B(K), β(b)(y ⊗ h) = (by) ⊗ h.

By Lemma 2.10 in [9], β is a completely isometric homomorphism. From the
same article, if m ∈ M, we deﬁne

µ(m) : H → K, µ(m)(α(a)(h)) = (ma) ⊗ h.

The map µ : M → µ(M) is a TRO homomorphism. Thus, µ(M) is a σ-TRO.
By Theorem 2.12 in [9], we have that

α(A) = [µ(M)∗β(B)µ(M)]

The proof is complete.

Theorem 3.2. The σ-strong ∆-equivalence of operator algebras is an equiv-
alence relation in the class of operator algebras.

Proof. It suﬃces to prove the transitivity property. Let A, B, and C be
operator algebras such that A ∼σ∆ B and B ∼σ∆ C. Therefore, there exists
a σ-TRO M and completely isometric homomorphisms α : A → α(A), β :
B → β(B) such that

By Theorem 3.1, there exists a σ-TRO N and a completely isometric homo-

Let D be the C ∗-algebra generated by the set {MM ∗} ∪ {N ∗N}. By Lemma

[9], we can prove that

k·k

α(A) = [T ∗γ(C)T ]

Thus, A ∼σ∆ C.

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.3. Let A, B be operator algebras. Then, A and B are σ-strongly
∆-equivalent if and only if they are stably isomorphic.

Proof. We assume that M is a σ-TRO satisfying

A = [M ∗BM]

k·k

, B = [MAM ∗]

k·k

.

Theorem 4.6 in [11] implies that there exists a completely isometric onto linear
map K∞(A) → K∞(B). By using the Banach-Stone theorem for operator
algebras, we may assume that this map is also a homomorphism [1, 4.5.13].
For the converse, suppose that K∞(A) and K∞(B) are completely isomet-
rically isomorphic as operator algebras. Let R∞ be the space of inﬁnite rows
consisting of compact operators. Then, R∞ is a σ-TRO, and we have that

R∞K∞(A)R∗

∞ = A,

[R∗

∞AR∞]

k·k

= K∞(A).

Thus, A ∼σT RO K∞(A). Therefore, A ∼σ∆ K∞(B). By the same arguments,
(cid:3)
B ∼σT RO K∞(B). Therefore, Theorem 3.2 implies that A ∼σ∆ B.

Corollary 3.4. Rieﬀel’s strong Morita equivalence of C ∗-algebras is weaker
than σ-strong ∆-equivalence.

Proof. It is well-known [4] that there exist C ∗-algebras that are strongly
Morita equivalent in the sense of Rieﬀel but are not stably isomorphic. Thus,
(cid:3)
by Theorem 3.3 these C ∗-algebras cannot be σ-strongly ∆-equivalent.

Corollary 3.5. Two σ-unital C ∗-algebras are strongly Morita equivalent in
the sense of Rieﬀel if and only if they are σ-strongly ∆-equivalent.

Proof. By [4], two σ-unital C ∗-algebras are strongly Morita equivalent in the
sense of Rieﬀel if and only if they are stably isomorphic. The conclusion is
(cid:3)
implied by Theorem 3.3.

4. Strong Morita embeddings

In [10], we deﬁned a new relation ⊂∆ between dual operator algebras:
Given two unital dual operator algebras A and B, we say that A ⊂∆ B if
there exists an orthogonal projection p ∈ B such that A and pBp are weakly
stably isomorphic. In this case, there exists a projection q ∈ Z(∆(B)) such
that pBp and qBq are weakly stably isomorphic [10, Lemma 2.11]. In the
present section, we aim to investigate the strong version of the previously
stated relation for operator algebras.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let A and B be operator algebras. We say that A, σ∆-
embeds into B, if there exists a projection p ∈ Z(∆(B∗∗)) such that pBp is
an operator algebra and A ∼σ∆ pBp. In this case, we write A ⊂σ∆ B.

Remark 4.1. Let A be a C ∗-algebra, and p be a central projection of A∗∗.
Because the map A → A∗∗, a → ap is a ∗-homomorphism, it has norm-closed
range. Thus, Ap is a C ∗-algebra.

In the following, we prove that ⊂σ∆ is transitive.

Theorem 4.2. Let A, B, C be operator algebras. If A ⊂σ∆ B and B ⊂σ∆ C,
then A ⊂σ∆ C.

Proof. Let p ∈ Z(∆(B∗∗)), q ∈ Z(∆(C ∗∗)) be such that pBp, qCq are operator
algebras and A ∼σ∆ pBp, B ∼σ∆ qCq. We write

ˆA = K∞(A), ˆB = K∞(B), ˆC = K∞(C).

Then,

ˆA∗∗ = M∞(A∗∗), ˆB∗∗ = M∞(B∗∗), ˆC ∗∗ = M w

∞(C ∗∗).

There exist completely isometric homomorphisms

θ : ˆA → ˆB∗∗, ρ : ˆB → ˆC ∗∗,

such that

θ( ˆA) = p∞ ˆBp∞, ρ( ˆB) = q∞ ˆCq∞.
There exists a completely isometric homomorphism ρ0 : ˆB∗∗ → ˆC ∗∗ such that
ρ0| ˆB = ρ, ρ0( ˆB∗∗) ⊆ q∞ ˆC ∗∗q∞.
Because p∞ ∈ Z(∆( ˆB∗∗)) and ρ0(p∞) ≤ q∞, there exists q0 ∈ Z(∆( ˆC ∗∗)) such
that ρ0(p∞) = q∞

0 . Now,

ρ(θ( ˆA)) = ρ0(θ( ˆA)) = ρ0(p∞ ˆBp∞) =
0 = q∞
0

0 q∞ ˆCq∞q∞

ρ0(p∞)ρ0( ˆB)ρ0(p∞) = q∞

ˆCq∞
0 .

Thus,

ρ ◦ θ(K∞(A)) = K∞(q0Cq0).

10

G.K. ELEFTHERAKIS

Because ρ ◦ θ is a completely isometric homomorphism, we have that

A ∼σ∆ q0Cq0 ⇒ A ⊂σ∆ C.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.3. Following this theorem, one should expect that ⊂σ∆ is a partial
order relation in the class of operator algebras if we identify those operator
algebras that are σ-strongly ∆-equivalent. This means that the additional
property holds that

A ⊂σ∆ B, B ⊂σ∆ A ⇒ A ∼σ∆ B.
However, this is not true, as we will prove in Section 5.

4.1. The case of C ∗-algebras. In this subsection, we investigate the rela-
tion ⊂σ∆ in the case of C ∗-algebras.
Theorem 4.4. Let A, B be C ∗-algebras. The following are equivalent:

(i)

.

A ⊂σ∆ B

(ii) There exists an onto ∗-homomorphism θ : K∞(B) → K∞(A).
(iii) There exists an ideal I of B such that

(not necessarily faithful) β : B → β(B) such that α(A) ∼σT RO β(B).

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii)

By Deﬁnition 4.1 and Theorem 3.3, there exist a projection p ∈ Z(B∗∗) and
a ∗-isomorphism ρ : K∞(pB) → K∞(A). Deﬁne the onto ∗-homomorphism
τ : K∞(B) → K∞(pB) given by τ ((bi,j)i,j) = (pbi,j)i,j. We denote θ = ρ ◦ τ.

(ii) ⇒ (i)
Suppose that θ∗∗ : M∞(B∗∗) → M∞(A∗∗) is the second dual of θ, then there

exists a projection q ∈ Z(B∗∗) such that

θ∗∗(xq∞) = θ∗∗(x), ∀ x ∈ M∞(B∗∗),
and θ|M∞(B∗∗q) is a ∗-homomorphism. Thus, if x ∈ K∞(B), we have that
θ(xq∞) = θ(x). Therefore,

K∞(Bq) ∼= K∞(A),

A ∼σ∆ Bq ⇒ A ⊂σ∆ B.

which implies that

(iii) ⇒ (ii)
If A ∼σ∆ B/I, then

K∞(A) ∼= K∞(B/I) ∼= K∞(B)/K∞(I).

Because K∞(I) is an ideal of K∞(B), there exists an onto ∗-homomorphism
θ : K∞(B) → K∞(A).

(ii) ⇒ (iii)
Suppose that θ : K∞(B) → K∞(A) is an onto ∗-homomorphism. Then,

there exists an ideal J ⊆ K∞(B) such that

K∞(B)/J ∼= K∞(A).

The ideal J is of the form K∞(I) for an ideal I of B. Thus,

K∞(B/I) ∼= K∞(B)/K∞(I) ∼= K∞(B)/J ∼= K∞(A).

Therefore, A ∼σ∆ B/I.

(iv) ⇒ (iii)
Suppose that α : A → α(A), β : B → β(B) are ∗-homomorphisms such
that Kerα = {0} and α(A) ∼σT RO β(B). Let I be the ideal Kerβ. Then,
β(B) ∼= B/I, and thus A ∼σ∆ B/I.

(iii) ⇒ (iv)
We assume that α : A → α(A) is a faithful ∗-homomorphism, and that
A ∼σ∆ B/I. By Theorem 3.1, there exists a faithful ∗-homomorphism γ :
B/I → γ(B/I) such that

If π : B → B/I is the natural mapping and β = γ ◦ π, then

α(A) ∼σT RO γ(B/I).

α(A) ∼σT RO β(B).

Remark 4.5. If A and B are W ∗-algebras and α : A → B,
β : B → A
are w∗-continuous onto ∗-homomorphisms, then A and B are ∗-isomorphic.
Indeed, there exist projections e1 ∈ Z(A), f1 ∈ Z(B) such that

Thus, there exists a projection e2 ∈ Z(A), e2 ≤ e1 such that

Ae1

∼= A.

Ae2

∼= Bf1 ⇒ Ae2
From the proof of Lemma 2.17 in [10], we have that A ∼= Ae1, and thus
A ∼= B. In Example 4.9, we will present non-isomorphic C ∗-algebras A and
B for which there exist onto ∗-homomorphisms α : A → B,
β : B → A.
These algebras are not W ∗-algebras.

∼= A.

Remark 4.6. As we have previously mentioned, in [10] we deﬁned an analo-
gous relation ⊂∆ between unital dual operator algebras. We have proven that
if A ⊂∆ B, where A, B are unital dual operator algebras, then there exists a
central projection p in ∆(B) and a Hilbert space H such that A ¯⊗B(H) and

12

G.K. ELEFTHERAKIS

(pBp) ¯⊗B(H) are isomorphic as dual operator algebras. Here, ¯⊗ is the nor-
mal spatial tensor product. In the case of W ∗-algebras, we have proven that
A ⊂∆ B if and only if there exists a a Hilbert space H and a w∗-continuous
∗-homomorphism from B ¯⊗B(H) onto A ¯⊗B(H)). We have also proven that
if A and B are W ∗-algebras such that A ⊂∆ B and B ⊂∆ A, then A and B
are stably isomorphic in the weak sense. We present a new proof of this fact
here.

Suppose that A ⊂∆ B and B ⊂∆ A. Then, there exist Hilbert spaces H and
K and w∗-continuous ∗-homomorphisms from B ¯⊗B(H) onto A ¯⊗B(H) and
from A ¯⊗B(K) onto B ¯⊗B(K). We conclude that there exist w∗-continuous
∗-homomorphisms from B ¯⊗B(H) ¯⊗B(K) onto A ¯⊗B(H) ¯⊗B(K) and from
A ¯⊗B(K) ¯⊗B(H) onto A ¯⊗B(K) ¯⊗B(H). Therefore, by Remark 4.5,

A ¯⊗B(K) ¯⊗B(H) ∼= B ¯⊗B(H) ¯⊗B(K).

Because

we have that

B(H) ¯⊗B(K)) ∼= B(K) ¯⊗B(H) ∼= B(K ⊗ H),

A ¯⊗B(K ⊗ H) ∼= B ¯⊗B(K ⊗ H).

Thus, A and B are stably isomorphic.

Remark 4.7. The relation ⊂∆ between W ∗-algebras is a partial order rela-
tion up to weak stable isomorphism [10]. This means that it has the following
properties:

(i) A ⊂∆ A.
(ii) A ⊂∆ B, B ⊂∆ C ⇒ A ⊂∆ C.
(iii)If A ⊂∆ B and B ⊂∆ A, then A and B are weakly stably isomorphic.
Therefore, it is natural to ask whether ⊂σ∆ is a partial order relation up
to strong stable isomorphism for C ∗-algebras. Although ⊂σ∆ satisﬁes the
properties (i) and (ii), it does not satisfy property (iii), as we show in Example
4.9. Nevertheless, ⊂σ∆ satisﬁes the property described in Theorem 4.18.

Example 4.8. Let X, Y be compact metric spaces, θ : X → Y be a contin-
uous one-to-one function, and C(X) and C(Y ) be the algebras of continuous
functions from X and Y , respectively, into the complex plane C, equipped
with the supremum norm. Then, the map

ρ : C(Y ) → C(X), ρ(f ) = f ◦ θ

is an onto ∗-homomorphism, and thus C(X) ⊂σ∆ C(Y ). Indeed, if g ∈ C(X)
we deﬁne

f0 : θ(X) → C, f0(θ(x)) = g(x).
Because θ : X → θ(X) is a homeomorphism, f0 is continuous. By Tietze’s
theorem, there exists f ∈ C(Y ) such that f |θ(X) = f0. We have that f ◦θ(x) =
g(x) for all x ∈ X, and thus ρ(f ) = g.

Example 4.9. There exist commutative C ∗-algebras A and B such that
A ⊂σ∆ B,
B ⊂σ∆ A, but A and B are not strongly Morita equivalent.
Thus, A and B are not σ∆- equivalent. We denote the following subsets of
C :

X = {z ∈ C : 1 ≤ |z| ≤ 5}, Y = {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ 5}.
We write A = C(X), B = C(Y ). Because X ⊆ Y , by Example 4.8 we
have that A ⊂σ∆ B. All of the closed discs of C are homeomorphic, and
thus there exists a homeomorphism θ : Y → X0, where X0 = {z ∈ C :
|z − 3| ≤ 1}. Because X0 ⊆ X, Example 4.8 implies that B ⊂σ∆ A. If A and
B were strongly Morita equivalent, then they would also be ∗-isomorphic. The
Stone-Banach theorem implies that X and Y would then be homeomorphic.
However, this contradicts the fact that Y is a simply connected set and X is
not.

Next, we will prove Theorem 4.18, which states the following:

A ⊂σ∆ B, B ⊂σ∆ A ⇒ Ar ∼σ∆ Bˆr, A(idA∗∗ − r) ∼σ∆ B(idB∗∗ − ˆr),

for central projections r ∈ A∗∗, ˆr ∈ B∗∗.

and a TRO homomorphism µ : M → B(H, K) such that the following hold:

A) If a ∈ A, b ∈ B, m, n ∈ M such that a = m∗bn, then α(a) = µ(m)∗β(b)µ(n).
B) If a ∈ A, b ∈ B, m, n ∈ M such that b = man∗, then β(b) = µ(m)α(a)µ(n)∗.

Because there exists a ∗-isomorphism from B∗∗ onto B∗∗ ¯⊗p mapping B

where the other diagonals have zero entries. Clearly, ζ(M) is a σ-TRO.

Let a ∈ A∗∗, x ∈ A∗∗e2, m, n ∈ M be such that ρ1(a) = θ1(a) = m∗xn.

By Lemma 4.15, we have that

Therefore,

am = mφ(a), ∀ a ∈ (A∗∗)′, m ∈ M.
By induction, there exist central projections {en : n ∈ N} ⊆ A∗∗ such that

Theorem 4.18. Let A, B be C ∗-algebras such that A ⊂σ∆ B,
B ⊂σ∆
A. Assume that e0 = idA∗∗, ˆe0 = idB∗∗. Then, there exist projections r ∈
Z(A∗∗), ˆr ∈ Z(B∗∗) such that

Ar ∼σ∆ Bˆr, A(e0 − r) ∼σ∆ B(ˆe0 − ˆr).

Proof. There exist projections e1 ∈ Z(A∗∗), f1 ∈ Z(B∗∗) such that

A ∼σ∆ Bf1, B ∼σ∆ Ae1.
Thus, there exists a projection e2 ∈ Z(A∗∗) such that e2 ≤ e1 and Bf1 ∼σ∆
Ae2. Therefore, A ∼σ∆ Ae2. By Lemma 4.17, there exist projections p, q, r ∈
Z(A∗∗) such that

e1 = p ⊕ q, e0 = r ⊕ q, p⊥q, r⊥q

and

Ap ∼σ∆ Ar.
Assume that ψ : K∞(Ae1) → K∞(B) is a ∗-isomorphism. Again, by ψ we
denote the second dual of ψ. Because p ≤ e1, there exists ˆp ∈ Z(B∗∗) such
that ψ(K∞(Ae1)∗∗p∞) = K∞(B)∗∗ ˆp∞. We have that

ψ(K∞(Ap)) = ψ(K∞(Ae1))ψ(p∞) = K∞(B ˆp).

Similarly, there exists a projection ˆq ∈ Z(B∗∗) such that

ψ(K∞(Aq)) = K∞(B ˆq).

Because p ⊥ q, we have that ˆp⊥ˆq. Furthermore, because e1 = p ⊕ q ⇒ ˆe0 =

We write ˆr for ˆp. The proof is now complete.

A(e0 − r) = Aq ∼σ∆ B ˆq = B(ˆe0 − ˆp).

5. Examples in the non-self-adjoint case

In this section, we will present a counterexample of two non-self-adjoint
ˆB ⊂σ∆ ˆA but ˆA and ˆB are not

operator algebras ˆA, ˆB such that ˆA ⊂σ∆ ˆB,
σ∆-strongly equivalent.

Let N , M be nests acting on the separable Hilbert spaces H1 and K1, re-
spectively. These nests are called similar if there exists an invertible operator
s : H1 → K1 such that

In this case, the map

M = {sn(H1) : n ∈ N }.

θs : N → M, θs(n) = sn(H1)

is a nest isomorphism. This means that θs is one-to-one, onto, and order-
preserving. We can easily check that Alg(M) = sAlg(N )s−1. If n ∈ N , we
write

n− = ∨{l ∈ N : l ≤ n, l 6= n}.
In the case where n− is strictly contained in n, the projection a = n − n− is
called an atom of N .

Theorem 5.1. [5, 13.20] The nests N , M are similar if and only if there
exists a nest isomorphism θ : N → M such that

dim((n − n−)(H1))) = dim((θ(n) − θ(n−))(H2)))

for all n ∈ N .

The lemmas 5.2 and 5.3 can be inferred from Section 13 in [5]. We present

the proofs here for completeness.

Lemma 5.2. Let N , M be separably-acting nests, and θ : N → M be a nest
isomorphism preserving the dimensions of the atoms. For every 0 < ǫ < 1,
there exists an invertible operator s, a unitary u, and a compact operator k
such that

s = u + k, kkk < ǫ, ks−1k < 1 + ǫ

and θ = θs.

ON STABLE MAPS OF OPERATOR ALGEBRAS

Proof. By Theorem [5, 13.20], there exists a compact operator k, a unitary
u, an invertible operator s = u + k, such that θ = θs and kkk < ǫ
1+ǫ. Observe
that kkk < ǫ. We have that u∗s = I + u∗k ⇒ kI − u∗sk < ǫ. Therefore,

Lemma 5.3. Let N , M be separably-acting nests and θ : N → M be a nest
isomorphism preserving the dimensions of the atoms. For every 0 < ǫ < 1,
there exists an invertible operator s, a unitary u, and compact operators k, l
such that

s = u + k, s−1 = u∗ + l, kkk < ǫ, klk < ǫ

and θ = θs.

Proof. Choose 0 < δ < 1 such that (1 + δ)δ < ǫ, δ < ǫ. By Lemma 5.2, there
exist a unitary u and compact k such that s = u + k is an invertible operator
and kkk < δ, ks−1k < 1 + δ, θ = θs. Deﬁne l0 = −u∗ks−1u. We have that
l0u∗s = −u∗k ⇒ l0(I + u∗k) = −u∗k ⇒ I = I + u∗k + l0(I + u∗k) ⇒

Because ku∗kk < δ < 1, the operator I + u∗k is invertible, and thus

I = (I + l0)(I + u∗k).

I + l0 = (I − (−u∗k))−1 =

(−u∗k)n.

By (5.1), we have that

n=0

I + l0 = s−1u ⇒ s−1 = u∗ + l0u∗.

If l = l0u∗, then l is a compact operator, and

klk =kl0u∗k = ks−1 − u∗k = ks−1u − Ik = ks−1(u − s)k =

ks−1kk ≤ ks−1kkkk < (1 + δ)δ < ǫ.

Thus, s−1 = u∗ + l and klk < ǫ.

j bisjai = ai = ais∗bisai.

Proof. Because

sj((ni)−(H1)) = θ((ni)−)(H2),

if ξ ∈ ai(H1), then ξ = ni(ξ) − (ni)−(ξ). Thus, there exist ξj, ωj ∈ H2, such
that

sj(ξ) =θ(ni)(ξj) − θ(ni)−(ωj) = (θ(ni) − θ(ni)−)(ξj) + (θ(ni)−(ξj) − θ(ni)−(ωj)) =

bi(ξj) + θ(ni)−(ξj − ωj).

pkp = s∗

Thus ρ(B) = pAp. Because p ∈ ∆(A∗∗)′ = Z(∆(A∗∗)), we have that B ⊂σ∆ A.

ON STABLE MAPS OF OPERATOR ALGEBRAS

In the following, we additionally assume that the dimensions of the atoms
of N and M are one and that ∆(A∗∗), ∆(B∗∗) are maximal abelian self-
adjoint algebras (MASAs). Such nests exist, see, for instance, Example 13.15
in [5]. We denote the algebras

ˆB = B ⊕ A ⊕ A ⊕ . . . ,
Because B ⊂σ∆ A, we have that ˆB ⊂σ∆ ˆA. Furthermore,

ˆA = A ⊕ A ⊕ . . . .

ˆA ∼= (0 ⊕ CIH1 ⊕ CIH1 ⊕ . . .) ˆB(0 ⊕ CIH1 ⊕ CIH1 ⊕ . . .).
Thus, ˆA ⊂σ∆ ˆB. If ⊂σ∆ was a partial-order relation for non-self-adjoint al-
gebras, then up to stable isomorphism we should have that ˆA ∼σ∆ ˆB. Thus,
the algebras

Ω = B∗∗ ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ . . . , Ξ = A∗∗ ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ . . .

would be weakly stably isomorphic. Because Ω and Ξ are CSL algebras (see
the deﬁnition of a CSL algebra in [5]), it follows from Theorem 3.2 in [7] and
Theorem 3.3 in [8] that there would exists a ∗-isomorphism

θ : ∆(Ω)′ → ∆(Ξ)′

such that θ(Lat(Ω)) = Lat(Ξ). However, ∆(Ω) and ∆(Ξ) are MASAs, and
thus there exists a unitary u such that

θ(x) = u∗xu, ∀ x ∈ ∆(Ω).

Therefore,

u∗Ωu = Ξ.
There exist completely contractive homomorphisms ρk : B∗∗ → A∗∗, k =
1, 2, ... such that

u∗(x ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = ρ1(x) ⊕ ρ2(x) ⊕ ..., ∀ x ∈ B∗∗.

Suppose that

Because

u∗(IH2 ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = p1 ⊕ p2 ⊕ ...

0 ⊕ ... ⊕ 0 ⊕ pi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ... ≤ p1 ⊕ p2 ⊕ ...

for all i, we have that

u(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ pi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u∗ ≤ IH2 ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...

Thus,

u(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ pi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u∗ = ˆpi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...
for orthogonal projections ˆpi ∈ ∆(B∗∗), i ∈ N. Observe that ˆpi ˆpj = 0 for i 6= j.
If x ∈ B∗∗, then

u∗(x ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)uu∗(IH2 ⊕ 0...)u = u∗(IH2 ⊕ 0...)uu∗(x ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u.

26

Thus,

G.K. ELEFTHERAKIS

(ρ1(x) ⊕ ρ2(x) ⊕ ...)(p1 ⊕ p2 ⊕ ...) = (p1 ⊕ p2 ⊕ ...)(ρ1(x) ⊕ ρ2(x) ⊕ ...).

We conclude that

ρi(x)pi = piρi(x), ∀i ∈ N, x ∈ B∗∗.

Thus, for all x ∈ B∗∗, we have that
u∗(x ⊕ 0...)uu∗(ˆpi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = (ρ1(x) ⊕ ρ2(x) ⊕ ...)(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ pi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...) =
(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ pi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)(ρ1(x) ⊕ ρ2(x) ⊕ ...) = u∗(ˆpi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)uu∗(x ⊕ 0...)u.
Therefore, ˆpi is in the center of B∗∗. However, as a nest algebra, B∗∗ has a
trivial center. We can, therefore, conclude that there exists i such that

ˆpi = IB∗∗

and ˆpj = 0 for all j 6= i. We obtain that

(5.2)

u∗(B∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = (0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ piApi ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)

By the same arguments, for the nest algebra A∗∗ there exists exactly one of
the algebras q1B∗∗q1, q2A∗∗q2, q3A∗∗q3, ... with q1 ∈ B∗∗, qk ∈ A∗∗, k ≥ 2 such
that

u(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = (q1B∗∗q1 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)

or

u(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = (0 ⊕ ... ⊕ 0 ⊕ qjA∗∗qj ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...).
Here, in the left-hand side, A∗∗ is in the i-th position. The equality (5.2)
implies that

u(0 ⊕ ...0 ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = (q1B∗∗q1 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)

We have proven that

u∗(B∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u ⊆ (0 ⊕ ... ⊕ 0 ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)

and

u(0 ⊕ ... ⊕ 0 ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u∗ ⊆ (B∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)

We conclude that

u∗(B∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)u = (0 ⊕ ... ⊕ 0 ⊕ A∗∗ ⊕ 0 ⊕ ...)

Thus, the nest algebras A∗∗ and B∗∗ are completely isometrically isomorphic.
It follows that their diagonals ∆(A∗∗) and ∆(B∗∗) are ∗-isomorphic. How-
ever, ∆(B∗∗) is an atomic MASA, and ∆(A∗∗) is a MASA with a nontrivial
continuous part. This contradiction shows that ˆA and ˆB are not σ-strongly
∆-equivalent.
