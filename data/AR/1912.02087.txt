Аннотация

In our research, we studied 9 eclipsing binary stars: AR Lac, U CrB,
S Equ, SU Boo, VV UMa, WW Gem, YY Eri, V0404 Lyr, HP Aur. We
collected large sets of moments of minima from BRNO and observational
data from AAVSO databases. Then, we obtained moments of minima for
AAVSO observations (totally - 397 minima) using method of approximation
with symmetric polynomial, realized in software MAVKA. This software was
provided by Kateryna D. Andrych and Ivan L. Andronov. After we combined
obtained moments of minima with data taken from BRNO and plotted O-C
diagrams. For all stars these diagrams represented sinusoidal-like oscillations
with superposition of linear (for SU Boo, VV UMa, WW Gem, V0404 Lyr and
HP Aur) or parabolic trend (for AR Lac, U CrB, S Equ and YY Eri). The
oscillations could be described as presence of the third component, which does
not take part in eclipses, but causes the well-known light-time eﬀect (LTE).
That eﬀect could be easily detected using long data series of observations.
However, the oscillations have clear asymmetry, which we interpreted as elliptical
shape of the third components orbit. Parabolic trend we explained as mass
transfer between components of binary system. For all stars we computed
minimal possible mass of the third component. In addition, we developed our
own code in computed language Python and using it we computed orbital
elements of the third component. Moreover, for stars with parabolic trend
we calculated rate of the mass transfer. Finally, for all computed values we
estimated errors.

1 Introduction

1.1 General information

For this research we chose 9 eclipsing binaries: AR Lac, U CrB, S Equ, SU Boo, VV
UMa, WW Gem, YY Eri, V0404 Lyr, HP Aur. All of them are well-known stellar
systems and were observed during long period of time (80-150 years). To carry out
our research, we took some general parameters (period, initial epoch, variability
type etc.) of the systems from General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS [1]).
Masses of the binary systems were taken from previously published articles. All
these parameters are collected in Table 1.

Unfortunately, only for three stellar systems (AR Lac, WW Gem and HP Aur)
errors of components masses were provided. For all other stars we supposed that
errors of masses for primary and secondary components are equal to 7% of their
masses. This value is equal to average relative error of stellar masses determination.
In addition, there is a lot of information published before in other articles of diﬀerent
authors.

1.2 AR Lac

Рис. 1: O-C curve of AR Lac. For each star we plotted O-C curve and made
approximation. Small dots are observations from database BRNO, large squares
are ones that we determined from AAVSO observations. The lines show the
approximation and the ±1σ and ±2σ ”error corridors” , where σ is a biased estimate
of the r.m.s. deviation of a single point from the approximation.

There are more than 200 articles published before, thus there is analysis only of
the most important of them. Third component was supposed in [10], [11], [12]. In
all three articles mass of the third component was estimated. However, parameters
of its orbit ware not computed. Mass transfer was assumed in [11], [13], [14], [15]
and [10]. In last four of these articles rate of the mass transfer was computed.

1.3 U CrB

Рис. 2: O-C curve of U CrB

Mass transfer was supposed in [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] and
[25]. Rate of the mass transfer was computed in [16], [18], [21], [26] and [24]. Third
component as the reason for cyclic period changes was supposed in [16], [26], [27],
[28], [29], [31], [30]. Third component’s mass was computed in [16], [29], [31], [30].
Orbital elements were estimated in [27] and [29]. Moreover, in [26] fourth component
was supposed and its mass was computed.

1.4 S Equ

Mass transfer was supposed and its rate was determined in [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]
and [36]. Third component was assumed and its mass was computed in [34], [35].
Moreover, in [34] parameters of the third component’s orbit were calculated.

2 Methods and algorithms

One of the methods of third component’s detection in eclipsing binary systems is
O-C curve investigation. O-C curve is a dependence between observed moment of
minimum minus calculated one and the time.

This method is one of the simplest when third component is neither visible
nor taking part in the eclipses. It is appropriate for any possible mass of the
third component if this mass is enough to make O-C oscillations larger then noise.
In this case, we can suppose the third component presence without spectroscopic
observations and even estimate some of its orbital parameters. On the other hand,
third components usually have long orbital period. That is why several decades of
regular observations are needed.

If O-C curve has sinusoid-like oscillations, we can suppose presence of the third
component which makes the binary system to rotate around common barycenter.
This motion causes delay (either positive or negative) of the minimal brightness
moment. If we plot the dependence of the delay on time we get sinusoid-like O-C
curve. After calculating amplitude and the period of such changes we can estimate
minimal possible mass of the third component. Although, sometimes oscillations
have clear asymmetry but stay periodic which might be caused by elliptical shape
of the third component’s orbit. Parameters of such which could be estimated by
special algorithms.

In the case of parabolic shape of O-C or parabolic trend with superposition of
cyclic period changes, we suppose presence of mass transfer between components
of binary system. If O-C is linear it could be caused by the error in the period
determination.

We estimated minimal possible mass of the third component using third Kepler’s
law and formula of the barycenter position. Then we supposed that orbit of the third
component is perpendicular to the picture plane (thus we get the minimal possible
value). After simpliﬁcations we got the international formula for minimal possible
mass of the third component:

M3 =

c · ∆t
√
3
G

·

(cid:20) 2π
T

· (M1 + M2 + M3)

To compute third components mass using this formula several iterations are needed.
Error of the minimal possible mass also was estimated:

Here:

• M1, M2, M3 - masses of the components;

• M - sum of the components masses;

• P - period of variability;

• ˙P - rate of the period change (days per day);

• ˙M - rate of the mass transfer (solar masses per year);

• c - speed of light in vacuum;

• G - gravitational constant;

• T, ∆t period and amplitude of the O-C oscillations;

• σP , σ ˙P , σM1, σM2, σ∆t, σT - errors of the period, rate of the period changes,
masses of the binary system’s components, amplitude and period of the O-C
oscillations.

Rate of the period change could be obtained by approximation of the parabolic
trend. The formula of parabola is well-known:

Here parameter

O − C = αt2 + βt + γ

α =

(6)

is proportional to the rate of the period changes; β is an error of the period in the
moment t=0; γ is the vertical shift (error of the initial epoch). Finally, we considered
the elliptic shape of the orbit. There are 6 main orbital elements which completely
describe the third component’s motion:

• semi-major axis (a);

• eccentricity (e);

• three angles of inclination

– argument of the pericenter (Ω);

– inclination (i);

– longitude of pericenter (ω);

• orbital period (T);

• moment of the pericenter transit (t0).

3 Data processing

There were several stages in our research:

1. Collecting moments of minima from database BRNO [41];

2. Collecting amateur observations from AAVSO database [42];

3. Processing AAVSO observations using MAVKA software [43];

(a) Splitting data onto separate minima;

(b) Cutting out extraeclipsing part of the minima (if necessary);

(c) Processing each individual minimum using symmetrical polynomial and

moment of minima obtaining.

4. Combination of AAVSO and BRNO minima;

5. Plotting O-C curve and estimation of the initial values of orbital parameters

by eye;

6. Correction of the orbital parameters by modelling program;

7. Making plots of O-C curve and deviations for visual control;

8. Calculation of the third component’s mass;

Our results generally are not in agreement with results of other authors. Only
for V0404 Lyr our estimation is more or less the same than in previos research. For
many stars our values are much higher - probably, they are overestimated. However,
for WW Gem and SU Boo masses are smaller, so we could underestimate them.
Unfortunately, only several authors provided errors of their calculations that makes
the comparison process really diﬃcult. Anyway, the order of value remains the same
for all 3rd components’ masses and we used much larger data sets. Thus, probably,
our data is more accurate, but we need further observations to prove that thesis.
