Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in natural language processing (NLP), we 
applied  cutting-edge  DL  techniques  to  predict  flight  departure  demand  in  a  strategic  time 
horizon  (4  hours  or  longer).  This  work  was  conducted  in  support  of  a  MITRE-developed 
mobile  application,  Pacer,  which  displays  predicted  departure  demand  to  general  aviation 
(GA) flight operators so they can have better situation awareness of the potential for departure 
delays during busy periods. Field demonstrations involving Pacer’s previously designed rule-
based prediction method showed that the prediction accuracy of departure demand still has 
room for improvement. This research strives to improve prediction accuracy from two key 
aspects:  better  data  sources  and  robust  forecasting  algorithms.  We  leveraged  two  data 
sources,  Aviation  System  Performance  Metrics  (ASPM)  and  System  Wide  Information 
Management (SWIM), as our input. We then trained forecasting models with DL techniques 
of sequence to sequence (seq2seq) and seq2seq with attention.  The case study has shown that 
our  seq2seq  with  attention  performs  best  among  four  forecasting  algorithms  tested.  In 
addition,  with  better  data  sources,  seq2seq  with  attention  can  reduce  mean  squared  error 
(mse) over 60%, compared to the classical autoregressive (AR) forecasting method.

Airport surface congestion and flight delays due to sudden surges in General Aviation (GA) flight demand have 
been a concern for airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Surface demand is comprised of aircraft 
from  scheduled  commercial  flights  and  unscheduled  GA  operations.  Commercial  flights  are  scheduled  months  in

advance and their schedule is shared among the airlines, the airports, and the FAA, whereas GA flights schedules are 
often more flexible, and, therefore, less predictable. For airports that experience large increases in GA traffic due to 
special public events (e.g., professional sports games) or airports that have a consistently high percentage of GA traffic 
(e.g., Van Nuys Airport (VNY), Teterboro Airport (TEB)), it can be quite challenging for FAA traffic managers to 
strategically manage expected demand.  

The MITRE Corporation has developed Pacer [1], a mobile application, to support the FAA for efficient surface 
management. Pacer displays future departure demand information to GA pilots and allows pilots to provide updates 
to  their  intended  departure  times;  this  information  is  subsequently  used  to  improve  future  departure  demand 
predictions. Field demonstrations involving Pacer’s previously designed rule-based prediction method showed that 
the prediction accuracy of departure demand still has room for improvement. Therefore, this research is one of several 
efforts that is exploring ways to improve prediction accuracy for GA departure demand. 

The latest trend in forecasting techniques has shifted from rule-based to intelligent deep learning (DL) methods. 
Machine learning (ML) methods are different from traditional rule-based methods as shown in  Fig. 1. In traditional 
rule-based methods, the domain experts define the rules, and then the computer makes predictions according to those 
rules. However, in ML, the rules are learned from data and applied to make predictions. DL is a subset of machine 
learning that utilizes programmable neural networks.  

Fig. 1 Traditional programming vs. machine learning methods comparison 

 Rule-based methods have some obvious deficiencies. For example, when the situation is extremely complicated 
(e.g., image classification for various types of cats vs. dogs), humans often cannot explicitly enumerate all the rules. 
Table 1 lists the shortcomings of Pacer’s rule-based methods and the benefits DL can bring to address those gaps. 

Table 1 Comparison of rule-based and DL methods 

Deficiencies of Rule-based Methods 
•  Rules may not accurately describe reality 
•  Rules may not be complete 
•  No learning ability 
•  Rules cannot be easily extended to other airports 
•  Few factors have been considered 

Promises of Proposed DL Methods 
•  Rules will be automatically learned from historical 

data 

•  Rules can be adaptively upgraded with latest available 

training data 

•  Models can be adaptively extended to other airports 

with transfer learning 

•  Multiple factors such as hour, day of week, and month 

can be included

Aviation flight demand prediction is a real-world application of a multi-horizon time series forecasting problem, 
which presents challenges due to multiple heterogeneous input variables, including observed past ground information 
and future known information such as hour of day, day of week, and month, etc. To tackle these complicated problems, 
our research explores DL forecasting techniques of sequence to sequence (seq2seq) [2] and seq2seq with attention [3] 
[4], which have demonstrated success in the NLP field for solving the machine translation problems. Those algorithms 
are designed to extrapolate past sequences to predict future sequences.  

With the promise of DL algorithms, aviation researchers are eager to adopt these cutting-edge techniques to address 
aviation-specific challenges. For example, researchers have applied these techniques to predict unstable approach risk 
at a specific distance location to the runway threshold [5], air travel demand for a representative city pair [6], flight 
delays [7], and taxi-out times at Charlotte Airport [8]. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section III gives a short introduction about our input data 
sources used in the research; and Section IV describes our problem formulations. Section V provides details of the 
deep learning modeling process, and the results are shown in Section VI. Finally, we conclude and describe next steps 
in Section VII. 

III.  Data Source 

DL algorithms run on data and the need for large amounts data is greater than ever. But more than large amounts 
of data, good data quality is also crucial to get the desired end result. Therefore, we took great effort to prepare our 
modeling dataset. 

For our departure demand prediction, we leveraged two aviation datasets: 1) Aviation System Performance Metrics 
(ASPM) [9] and 2) System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) [11]. A short description of these two data sources 
is provided. 

A.  Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) dataset 

The ASPM dataset is a well-known operational data source that the FAA maintains. It integrates multiple data 
sources  together  and  provides  information  about  flights  arriving  or  departing  an  airport.  The  ASPM  dataset  has 
quarter-hour aggregated demand, delays, runway configuration, and weather information needed for forecasting. Table 
2 lists the key data items used in our study [10]. In particular, quarter-hour departure demand (DepDemand) is our 
targeted forecasting objective, and the other elements are our inputs. One shortcoming with ASPM is its long updating 
frequency, only once per day. In addition, once updated, only the previous day’s data are available. Therefore, ASPM 
is not well suited for frequent forecasting updates.

B.  System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) dataset  

To complement ASPM’s deficiency, we brought in another FAA data source, SWIM, which can give us first-hand, 
near real-time information about the state of an airport’s surface. SWIM is updated every minute and has information 
such  as  arrival/departure  lists  and  taxi-in/taxi-out  times.  Therefore,  our  modeler  can  reduce  prediction  error  by  1) 
using shorter look ahead times, and 2) updating the forecasts more frequently. 

Compared to ASPM, SWIM data is still in an early development stage. The data is provided in XML format, and 
then each user group processes it according to their research needs. The version of SWIM data available to support 
our work is noisy. Therefore, we spent a great effort to clean the data with departure track assembly, data exploration, 
data visualization, and domain experts’ evaluation.  

3 

 
In addition, the SWIM data covers only the core 30 airports [12]. Therefore, we plan to build two types of models 
for airports: one that is capable of using both ASPM and SWIM data as inputs, and the other that just uses ASPM data 
when SWIM data are not available. 

IV.  Problem Formulation 

Flight departure demand forecasting problems can be formulated as multivariate multi-step time series forecasting 
problems (Eq. (1)). Time lag (𝑝) was learned from the data and the maximum look ahead time, 𝜏!"#, is determined 
by the data updating frequency and Pacer’s needs. Fig. 2 explicitly demonstrates the relationship of inputs and outputs 
in a given time horizon. The inputs are made up of two parts: past observed inputs and future known inputs. For our 
targeted  departure  demand  (DepDemand)  prediction,  Table  3  lists  the  detailed  inputs  and  outputs.  Next,  we  will 
discuss how deep learning methods, seq2seq and seq2seq with attention are built to find function 𝑓.

V.  Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting 

Solving  real-world  time  series  forecasting  problems  can  be  challenging.  The  challenges  are  multifaceted  and 
include, for example, heterogeneous input variables, accounting for future known factors (e.g., day of week), and the 
need to perform the same type of prediction for multiple physical sites, like different airports, in our case [14]. 

This research solves the complicated time series forecasting problems with DL methods, which can bring many 
benefits.  For  example,  they  can  handle  multiple  exogenous  variables  with  complex  dependencies,  identify  the 
multifaceted relationship between input variables and output variables, learn and adapt, and extend to multiple sites 
with ease. Our research sought to enable DL to predict aviation flight departure demand for Pacer. Fig. 3 depicts the 
designed DL model training architecture for Pacer’s demand forecasting.

C.   Feature Preparation 

When we train DL models, feature preparation plays an essential role. Simply stated, feature preparation transforms 
raw data into the DL algorithm-required format, as well as improves the model performance. Domain knowledge and 
feature engineering knowledge are important components at this step. We designed a five-stage feature processing 
procedure (Fig. 4) to transform raw time series data into sequence data required by our sequence to sequence (seq2seq) 
and seq2seq with attention models, which are described in the following section.

D.  Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) Method 

Seq2seq was originally designed by Google for machine translation problems and has achieved a lot of success in 
tasks  like  machine  translation.  One  famous  example  is  Google  Translate,  which  started  using  such  a model in 
production in late 2016. These models can be found in two pioneering papers ( [2], [15]).  

Inspired  by  the  success  of  seq2seq  in  the  NLP  field,  researchers  have  explored  seq2seq  for  the  time  series 
forecasting  problems  because  they  have  a  similar  problem  structure  (e.g.,  [16]).    Seq2seq  can  achieve  better 
performance than traditional statistical time series forecasting methods, which usually require strong restrictions and 
assumptions.  

5 

 
 
 
As  the  name  suggests,  seq2seq  takes  an  input  sequence  (e.g.,  sentences  in  English)  and  generates  an  output 
sequence (e.g., the same sentences translated to Chinese). It does so by using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Two 
commonly used types of RNN are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) because 
LSTM and GRU can better handle the vanishing gradient problem [17], which can cause the neural network to not be 
trained properly. 

Seq2seq is made up of two parts: the encoder and the decoder. It is sometimes referred to as the Encoder-Decoder 

Network (Fig. 5). 

•  Encoder: Uses deep neural network layers and converts the input sequence to a corresponding hidden vector 

as an initial state to the first recurrent layer of the decoder part. 

•  Decoder: Takes the input from a) the hidden vector generated by the encoder, b) its own hidden states, c) its 
own current output, and d) future known factors 𝐹 to produce the next hidden vector and finally predict the 
next output. 

In our research, out future known inputs are categorical variables such as hour of day, day of week, month etc. 
Therefore, we use an embedding layer to encode them first and then send them to LSTM cells.  Because LSTM type 
of cells performs better than GRU, we chose to proceed with LSTM in our seq2seq model building. 

Fig. 5 Seq2seq architecture for our departure demand time series forecasting 

One of the drawbacks of seq2seq models is that they have difficulty handling long input sequences because their 
encoding context is wrapped up in a specified size vector. In the case of long sequences, there is a high probability 
that the initial context has been lost by the end of the sequence. 

E.  Sequence to sequence (seq2seq) with Attention Method 

To deal with the aforementioned issue, seq2seq with attention models have been introduced in two papers( [3], 
[4]).  The method introduced a technique called “Attention,” which flexibly focuses on different parts of the input 
sequence at every stage of the output sequence by preserving all the context.  Fig. 6 illustrates our customized seq2seq 
with Luong’s attention network structure for departure demand forecasting.

VI.  Results 

This section presents our modeling results with different forecasting methods. We selected Las Vegas McCarran 
International Airport (LAS) for case study because LAS represents a busy airport with many airline operations as well 
as a significant number of GA operations that can surge around certain events. To better understand how DL would 
improve  forecasting  performance,  we  also  chose  two  baseline  algorithms,  linear  regression  (LR)  [18]  and  the 
autoregression (AR) [19], for the comparison. The following sub-sections give a short introduction to these baseline 
algorithms and all models’ prediction results. 

A.  Baseline Algorithms 
A.1 Linear Regression  

In statistics, linear  regression is  used  to  model  the  relationship  between  a  scalar  response  and  one  or 
more explanatory variables. The very simplest case of a single scalar predictor variable x and a single scalar response 
variable y is known as simple linear regression (see Fig. 7). The extension to multiple and/or vector-valued predictor 
variables  (denoted  with  X)  is  known  as multiple  linear  regression,  also  known  as multivariable  linear  regression. 
Nearly all real-world regression models are multiple regression models. Note, however, that in these cases the response 
variable y is still a scalar. Another term, multivariate linear regression, refers to cases where y is a vector [18].  

7 

 
 
Fig. 7 Example of simple linear regression, which has one independent variable ( [18]) 

A.2 Autoregression (AR) 

Autoregression (AR)  is  another  popular  stochastic  process model  designed  for  time  series  forecasting.  The 
autoregressive  model  specifies  that  the  output  variable  depends linearly on  its  own  previous  values  and  on 
a stochastic term, as shown in  Eq. (2). AR methods cannot consider as many factor variables as DL and LR do. The 
only prior knowledge required is its history.

Where y is the observation, c is constant (intercepts), 𝜙 is coefficient, and 𝜖 is error item. 

B.  Train and Test Data Split 

In ML, the dataset is commonly split into two sets: training and testing. For our model training, we used the year 
of 2019 [1/1/2019, 12/31/2019] as our training dataset, and one month of 01/2020 [1/1/2020, 1/31/2020] as our testing 
dataset.  

C.  LAS Departure Demand Forecasting Results 

Table 4 compares five models’ performances with different combinations of data sources and modeling methods. 
The best evaluation metrics (mse, mae, and explained variance) are highlighted in yellow. For mse and mae values, a 
lower value is better and for the explained variance score, a higher value is better. It is obvious that seq2seq with 
attention, combined with input data sources of ASPM and SWIM, achieves the best performance. Its mse is 62% better 
than the AR model, and 39% better than the LR model. Since SWIM data are updated every minute, we can shorten 
the look ahead times from 31 hours to 4 hours, and at the same time update our predictions every 15 minutes. Even 
when a single data source (ASPM) is used, seq2seq with attention still produces the predictions with the lowest error.

Table 4 Model performances comparison 

Fig.  8  shows  an  example  of  LAS  quarter-hour  departure  demand  forecasting  results  by  seq2seq  with  attention 
model for several testing days. The blue line represents the true departure demand, and the red line is the forecasted 
demand by seq2seq with attention model. From the graph, the seq2seq with attention model does a pretty good job 
predicting the actual departure demand, including capturing demand surges at some periods.

Fig. 9 compares the five models’ forecasted quarter-hour departure demand at LAS airport with true demand (red). 
According  to  Fig.  9,  only  seq2seq  with  attention  model  combining  SWIM  near  live  data  can  capture  the  sudden 
demand surge on 1/10/2020.

Fig. 9 LAS models quarter-hour departure demand forecasting results comparison 

Additionally, we aggregated the quarter-hour forecasted demand to hourly and daily forecasts. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 
show the comparison of the hourly and daily forecasting results. According to the evaluation metrics, seq2seq with 
attention combining SWIM data still performs the best in those two cases. In comparison, AR still performs the worst 
over all three-evaluation metrics.

In short, the LAS case study demonstrates superiority of the DL method, seq2seq with attention combined with 

SWIM data over the other examined methods.  

VII.  Conclusions and Future Work 

This paper applied DL models, seq2seq and seq2seq with attention, to improve flight departure demand forecast 
accuracy for Pacer, which aims to improve surface situation awareness and operational predictability at airports with 
a sizeable number of GA flight operations that experience departure delays and surface congestion. The research has 
demonstrated that combining good input data and robust forecasting algorithms is a key to obtaining the best prediction 
performance. With both ASPM and SWIM as input data sources, the model can reduce mse by 62% over the baseline 
algorithm of AR. Currently, we are also exploring the use of a transformer model for departure demand forecasting to 
seek even better performance.
