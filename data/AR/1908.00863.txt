Abstract

We performed measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force between Au-coated surfaces of

a sphere and a plate by means of signiﬁcantly upgraded dynamic atomic force microscope (AFM)

based technique. By introducing combined cleaning procedure of interior surfaces of the vacuum

chamber and the test bodies by means of UV light and Ar ions, we reached higher vacuum and

eliminated the role of electrostatic patches. Furthermore, the use of much softer cantilever allowed

a sixfold decrease of the systematic error in measuring the force gradient. The experimental data

are compared with theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory taking into account corrections

due to the inaccuracy of the proximity force approximation and that due to surface roughness. It

is shown that the theoretical approach accounting for the relaxation properties of free electrons is

excluded by the data up to a larger than previous sphere-plate separation of 820 nm, whereas an

alternative approach is found in a very good agreement with the data. Importance of these results

in connection with the foundations of quantum statistical physics is discussed.

The Casimir force originally predicted [1] between two uncharged ideal metal planes was

later generalized for any two material bodies and explained as an eﬀect of the zero-point

and thermal ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld along with the van der Waals force

[2] (see the monograph [3] for further developments). Presently the Casimir force has been

measured in numerous experiments to gain a fundamental understanding of the physics (see

the reviews [4–6]), and is proposed for use in the next generation of nanotechnological devices

[7–13].

A comparison between the measurement data of the most precise experiments and the-

oretical predictions of the Lifshits theory revealed a puzzling inconsistency of fundamental

signiﬁcance. It was realized [3, 4, 6] that the theory is in conﬂict with the data at sepa-

rations below 1 µm if the real part of the conductivity of materials is taken into account

in computations (at the moment there are no direct measurements of the Casimir inter-

action between metallic surfaces at separations above 1µm). A good agreement between

the theory and the data is regained if one neglects the low-frequency relaxation properties

of free charge carriers and the dc conductivity in dielectrics (the most recent experiments

demonstrating this result are described in Refs. [14–21]). In all these experiments with the

exception of Ref. [20] the diﬀerence between the two alternative theoretical predictions does

not exceed 5%. As a result, there were attempts to explain the Casimir puzzle as the role

of some unaccounted background eﬀect, i.e., by an additional force due to surface patches

[22–24]. Experiments with magnetic test bodies [17–19] (and especially Ref. [20] where the

alternative theoretical predictions diverged by up to a factor of 1000) have shown, however,

that the Casimir puzzle is not governed by the role of surface patches and other background

eﬀects.

In this paper, we describe measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force between

Au-coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate by means of a signiﬁcantly upgraded dynamic

AFM based technique with in situ UV and Ar ion cleaned surfaces of the test bodies.

The components of the setup reported previously [16] are upgraded by incorporating a

UV lamp and an Ar-ion gun. This makes possible the removal of contaminants from all

interior surfaces of the vacuum chamber and a signiﬁcant decrease in the residual potential

diﬀerence between the test bodies (a factor of 10 compared to Ref. [16]). Furthermore, the

force sensitivity was improved by the preparation and use of a cantilever with a smaller

(factor of 10) spring constant than in the previous work [16]. As a result, the calibration

2

constant in the present measurements is by an order of magnitude larger than in Ref. [16]

leading to smaller (by a factor of 6) systematic error in measuring the gradient of the Casimir

force. After a comparison between the measurement data and theory, these improvements

allowed clear discrimination between two theoretical approaches mentioned above up to the

separation distance of 820 nm (compared with 420 nm in Ref. [16]).

The schematic of the upgraded experimental setup is presented in Fig. 1. Below we remark

only on the novel elements. Additional details of the setup and description of the calibration

procedures can be found in Refs. [16, 21]. The gradient of the Casimir force was measured
between the Au-coated hollow glass sphere of R = 43.446 ± 0.042 µm radius (measured by

means of scanning electron microscope after the experiment was completed) and Au-coated

silicon plate. The hollow glass spheres were made from liquid phase and therefore are almost

spherical with the diﬀerence along two perpendicular axes being less than or equal to 0.1%,

i.e., of the order of the radius measurement error. The sphere is attached to the electrically

grounded cantilever. The spring constant k of this cantilever was reduced by decreasing its
thickness and width by means of etching with 60% KOH solution at a temperature of 50 ◦C

for 55 seconds. Relatively high concentration and temperature were used to obtain smooth

surfaces after etching [25].

The use of the polished silicon wafer as the base plate instead of sapphire or fused silica

plates used in previous measurements [16, 21] and an E-beam evaporator for making the

Au coatings instead of a thermal evaporator allowed a decrease in the surface roughness by

up to a factor of 2. The r.m.s. roughness on the sphere and the plate, measured after the

experiment was completed, is δs = 1.13 nm and δp = 1.08 nm (compared with δs = 2.0 nm

and δp = 1.8 nm in Ref. [16]). The Au-coated plate is mounted on a piezoelectric tube which

helps to precisely control its position (see Fig. 1). In its turn, the tube is mounted on a

XYZ linear translational stage used for the coarse approach of the plate to the sphere. The

cantilever motion is monitored with a laser optical interferometer. The laser light source has

a wavelength of 1550 nm. The second interferometer using a wavelength of 520 nm serves

to measure the movement of the Au-coated plate (see Fig. 1).

The major improvement, as compared to previous experiments, is the UV followed by

Ar-ion cleaning of the test bodies and surfaces inside the vacuum chamber. The removal

of contamination on the Au sphere-plate surfaces using only Ar-ion gun has been already

studied in Ref. [21]. As a result, the residual potential diﬀerence V0 between a sphere and a

3

plate was lowered by an order of magnitude leading to a reduced role of electrostatic forces

discussed in the literature [22, 23]. In the Ar-ion cleaning, however, the ions are focused on

the interacting sphere-plate surfaces and the adsorbed contaminants on the experimental

chamber walls are not completely removed. Thus, over longer periods of time, the desorp-

tion of contaminants from the chamber walls leads to the redeposition of contaminant gas

molecules on the Au surfaces of test bodies resulting in increase of residual electric potential

diﬀerence V0.

It has been shown [26–31] that the water and organic contaminants can be removed from

the chamber walls, as well as the sphere-plate surfaces, with the use of UV light. We used the

UV lamp (UV B-100 Water Desorption System, RBD Instruments, Inc.) with dimensions
of 10.5′′ length and 1.3125′′ diameter. It is installed on the top of the chamber as is shown

in Fig. 1. The emitted wavelengths are a combination of 185 nm (2 W power) and 254 nm

(5 W power). The former is absorbed by oxygen and leads to the generation of highly

reactive ozone, whereas the letter is absorbed by most hydrocarbons and ozone leading to

their ionization and desorption from surfaces.

The combined UV/Ar cleaning procedure was performed as follows. The vacuum chamber
was ﬁrst pumped down to pressure of about 9 × 10−9 Torr using the scroll mechanical pump

and the turbo pump (see Ref. [16] for a description of the vacuum system which also includes

the ion pump). Then the UV lamp was turned on for 10 min. and because of the formation

of ozone, atomic oxygen and resulting oxidation of surface hydrocarbons to more volatile
species, the chamber pressure rises to 8 × 10−7 Torr. The volatile species were pumped out

by the turbo and mechanical pumps leaving Au surfaces and chamber walls free of water

and organic contaminants. A rough measurement of V0 for a sphere-plate separation of 1 µm

shows that the UV cleaning leads to an increase of the residual potential diﬀerence from
49.5 ± 0.5 mV to higher values of approximately 100–200 mV (measured after the UV lamp

was turned oﬀ for 60 minutes). This can be explained by the exposed inorganic contaminants

on the sample surfaces.

To remove the latter and any remaining organics, Ar-ion-beam bombardment [21, 31, 32]

was used after the UV cleaning process. The Ar ion gun was installed horizontally on the

left side of the chamber as shown in Fig. 1. The sphere-plate distance was increased up to

500 µm. Note that during both UV and Ar-ion cleaning the ion pump was shut oﬀ to avoid

contamination of its electrodes. To initiate the process, the Ar gas was released into the

4

chamber until the pressure reached 1.2 × 10−5 Torr. The turbo pump gate valve was half

closed to keep the pressure constant. The Ar ions were accelerated under 500 V electric

ﬁeld. The kinetic energy of the grazing incidence Ar ions was high enough to break chemical

bonds of the Au oxide and organic molecules, but low enough to prevent any sputtering of

the Au surface. The cleaning was done in 5 min. steps. After each step the turbo pump
gate valve was opened allowing the pressure to reach 5 × 10−9 Torr in less than 30 min.

Next a rough value of V0 was measured. This process was repeated till V0 reached near
zero. The ﬁnal measured value was 2.0 ± 0.5 mV. To reduce mechanical noise, the ion pump

was turned on and the turbo pump and mechanical pump were ﬁrst valved and then turned

oﬀ. Thus, a combination of in situ UV and Ar-ion cleaning allows us to achieve ultra high
vacuum 5 × 10−9 Torr resulting in clean sphere-plate surfaces with very low and time stable

V0 (the drift rate of V0 was measured to be less than 0.005 mV/min).

The force gradient between the sphere and plate was measured through the shift ∆ω of

the resonant frequency of the cantilever with attached sphere (ω0) which was recorded as a

function of the sphere-plate separation a in 1 nm steps. The relative sphere-plate distance

zrel was controlled by application of voltage to the piezoelectric tube supporting the plate

(see Fig. 1). The distance moved by the plate was calibrated using the interferencer fringes

from the 520 nm ﬁber interferometer.

In doing so the absolute sphere-plate separation

a = z0 + zrel, where z0 is the separation at the point of closest approach.

For the force gradient measurements, 11 voltages Vi (i = 1, . . . , 11) were sequentially

applied to the plate and the cantilever frequency shift was measured as a function of the

plate separation. The plate movement was corrected for the mechanical drift found to

be –0.00575 nm/s as described in Ref. [16]. To subtract any systematic background in

the frequency shift due to the noise coming from the plate movement, the sphere-plate

separation was increased to 50 µm, where the interaction force gradients are well beyond the

experimental sensitivity, and the experiments were repeated with a voltage V0 applied to the

plate. After averaging 8 frequency shift measurements the background change in frequency
due to the mechanical movement of the plate can be found to be linear at 1.5 × 10−6 Hz/nm.

This small background noise signal due to the plate movement was subtracted from all

frequency shift signals.

The frequency shift is given by

∆ω = −C

∂X(a, R)
∂a

(Vi − V0)2 − C

∂F (a)
∂a

,

(1)

where the calibration constant C = ω0/(2k), X is the known function of the electric force in

the sphere-plate geometry [3, 16] and F is the Casimir force. At any given separation, ∆ω is

proportional to the square of the voltage diﬀerence. Therefore the parameters γ = C∂X/∂a

and V0 can be found by ﬁtting parabolas and be plotted as functions of distance (see Ref. [16]

for details). The V0 obtained at each separation are shown in Fig. 2 resulting in the mean
value ¯V0 = 1.93 ± 0.01 mV. Then the best ﬁts of the exact expression for γ to the measured
data was done leading to z0 = 240.2 ± 0.6 nm and C = (6.472 ± 0.012) × 105 s/kg. The latter
is almost an order of magnitude larger than the calibration constant ˜C = (0.683 ± 0.002) ×
105 s/kg in Ref. [16]. This increase is connected with the fact that now we use a much more

sensitive cantilever with a smaller (by a factor of 10) spring constant. In previous reports

performed with specially selected samples, possessing constant but larger V0, the gradient

of the total measured force was also larger. However, the gradients of the Casimir force

obtained in Ref. [16] after a subtraction of electrostatic contributions are in good agreement

with the measurement results obtained here at higher precision over the wider separation

region.

After completion of the calibration, the force gradient of the Casimir force F ′ = ∂F/∂a

was calculated with a step of 1 nm using Eq. (1) and the above parameters C, z0 and
V0 = ¯V0. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 3(a,b,c,d) as crosses over deﬀerent

separation regions. The arms of the crosses show the total experimental errors determined

at the 67% conﬁdence level (random and systematic errors added in quadrature). In so doing,

the systematic error in the measured gradient of the Casimir force is mostly determined by
the systematic error in measuring the frequency shift which is equal to 5.5 × 10−2 rad/s in

this experiment.

The gradient of the Casimir force in the experimental conﬁguration was computed in

the framework of the Lifshitz theory taking into account corrections to the proximity force

approximation and surface roughness. The thicknesses of the Au coatings on the sphere and
the plate were 118 ± 1 nm and 120 ± 1 nm, respectively. This is more than suﬃcient for

these coatings to be considered as inﬁnitely thick. As a result, the gradient of the Casimir

Refs. [33–37] (here we use the computational results for β obtained in Ref. [36] for the force

gradient). The Casimir pressure at temperature T is given by the Lifshitz formula [2–4]:

Computations with Eqs. (2)–(4) have been made at the 20◦C which is the experiment

temperature. The values of εl were obtained from the tabulated optical data for Au extrap-

olated down to zero frequency either by the Drude model taking into account the energy

losses of conduction electrons or by the plasma model which neglects these losses [3, 4].

The respective values for the function β [36] have been used in both versions of the com-

putations. The computational results are shown in Fig. 3 by the upper and lower bands

computed when using the optical data extrapolated by the plasma and Drude model, respec-

tively. The widths of the bands reﬂect the theoretical errors which are mostly determined

by the inaccuracies in the optical data.

As is seen in Fig. 3, the predictions of the Lifshitz theory with the inclusion of energy

losses of conduction electrons are excluded by the measurement data up to the separation
distance a ≈ 820 nm. At the same time, the predictions of the same theory with the energy

losses of the conduction electrons neglected are in excellent agreement with the data. The

same conclusion, but at separations up to 420 nm was obtained earlier by means of the

7

dynamic AFM [16] and at separations up to 750 nm by means of a micromachined oscillator

[3, 4, 20, 38, 39].

To conclude, in this experiment we reconsider the problem which remains a long standing

puzzle. In doing so, special experimental eﬀorts have been taken to avoid any impact of elec-

trostatic patches on the measurement results for the Casimir force. On the theoretical side,

due to the long-term eﬀorts of several authors it was shown that the inﬂuence of deviations

from the proximity force approximation [35, 36], as well as the role of surface roughness

[3, 4, 40, 41], does not change the obtained results. Thus, the Casimir puzzle assumes

a fundamental importance casting doubts on the basic assumption of quantum statistical

physics that a material system responds similarly to electromagnetic ﬁelds with nonzero

ﬁeld strength and to ﬂuctuating ﬁelds possessing zero ﬁeld strength and nonzero dispersion.

The complete resolution of this problem requires measurements at large separations. The

present experiment is a step forward in this direction.
