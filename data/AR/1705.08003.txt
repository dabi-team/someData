ABSTRACT

Studying the dynamics of ﬁlaments at pre-eruption phase can shed light on the precursor of eruptive
events. Such studies in high-resolution (in the order of 0.1”) are highly desirable yet very rare so far.
In this work, we present a detailed observation of a pre-eruption evolution of a ﬁlament obtained by
the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). One end of the ﬁlament
is anchored at the sunspot in NOAA active region (AR) 11515, which is well observed by NST Hα
oﬀ-bands four hours before till one hour after the ﬁlament eruption. A M1.6 ﬂare is associated with
the eruption. We observed persistent downﬂowing materials along the Hα multi-threaded component
of the loop towards the AR end during the pre-eruption phase. We traced the trajectories of plasma
blobs along the Hα threads and obtained the plane-of-sky velocity of 45 km s−1 on average. We
further estimated the real velocities of the downﬂows and the altitude of the ﬁlament by matching the
observed Hα threads with magnetic ﬁeld lines extrapolated from a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF)
model. Observation of chromospheric brightenings (BZs) at the footpoints of the falling plasma blobs
is also presented in the paper. The lower limit of the kinetic energy per second of the downﬂows
through the BZs is found to be ∼ 1021 erg. Larger FOV observations from BBSO full disk Hα images
show that the AR end of the ﬁlament started ascending four hours before the ﬂare. We attribute the
observed downﬂows at the AR end of the ﬁlament to the draining eﬀect of the ﬁlament rising prior
to its eruption. During the slow-rise phase, the downﬂows continuously drained away ∼ 1015g mass
from the ﬁlament over a few hours, which is believed to be essential for the instability at last, and
could be an important precursor of eruptive events.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬁlaments (on disk)/prominences (on limb) have been studied for decades and their structures have become
one of the well known features on solar atmosphere. They are formed of numerous cool and dense plasma threads
upheld by highly sheared and twisted magnetic ﬁelds in chromosphere and corona, and can last for days or even
weeks in corona until disappear in-situ or violent eruption (Martin 1973). Moreover, ﬁlament eruptions could be part
of other dynamic and energetic events such as ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (Van Driel-Gesztelyi et al.
2012). Filament evolution can give insight to the local magnetic ﬁeld structure which otherwise cannot be measured
directly. For instance, ﬁlaments’ spatial evolution discloses the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld topologies as a ﬂare evolves
(Hirayama 1974).

Filament is composed of spine, barbs and two ends. They are lying on sheared arcade and above magnetic polarity
inversion line (PIL) (Kleint et al. 2015). According to some models, the structure of dipped ﬁeld lines are responsible for
dense matter accumulation (Demoulin et al. 1989). Such dip structures form in the magnetic conﬁguration allowing
dense matters accumulate and tend to bend down at the top of arcades (Aulanier & Demoulin 1998). Filament
naturally involve radial outward magnetic force, so the weight of these dense matters balance out the upward Lorentz
force, and result in the ﬁlament equilibrium. Magnetic structure expulsion therefore was believed to be a consequence
of not capable of conﬁning the magnetic ﬁelds (Fong et al. 2002). During the eruption downﬂows are expected to be
present to drain away the most part of ﬁlament material, and accompanied with the upward transport of magnetic
ﬂux due to the magnetic ﬁelds ascent (Petrie & Low 2005). Draining rate of 1015 g in a quiescent ﬁlament per day was
estimated by Liu et al. (2012). The magnetic energy that is required for the eruption could be as large as the weight
of removal materials that holds the entire magnetic structure in force equilibrium.

Filament dynamics have been studied in Hα and EUV observations through the analysis of the paths of absorption
features and Doppler shift (Parenti & Vial 2014). Tracing features of time sequence images and analyzing spectral line
proﬁles obtain two complementary components: plane-of-sky velocity and line-of-sight (LOS) motion of mass ﬂows.
Counter-Streaming mass ﬂow along interleaved threads of ﬁlaments was ﬁrst observed through Hα Doppler map with
a speed of 5∼20 km s−1(Zirker et al. 1998). Individual barbs stretched from a quiescent ﬁlament spine in Ca II H and
Hα lines show the horizontal speed of 10 km s−1 and the downward speed of 35 km s−1 (Kucera 2015). The mass
ﬂow of 25 - 30 km s−1 plane-of sky velocity from the spine that led to bard formation was also reported by Joshi et al.
(2013). In earlier review by (Mackay et al. 2010), downﬂow blobs are moving along the vertical threads in ∼10 km s−1.
These ﬂows have velocities on average lower than sound speed in 20-40 km s−1 for prominence plasma (Parenti 2014).
But in EUV observation, the ﬂow motion in a ﬁlament is faster that in Hα observation, e.g., the counter-steaming ﬂow
motion in an active ﬁlament can reach to 100 km s−1 in EUV 193 ˚A band (Alexander et al. 2013). As suggested by
Kucera (2015), EUV observations of the moving plasma features have shown faster than what is considered normal in
Hα. This is because that the hot plasma as observed in EUV is not visible in Hα.

Threads of ﬁlament mass ﬂow are to some extent analogue to coronal rain, the scene of which could be described
as plasma moving along the magnetic ﬁeld lines (Antolin et al. 2012). The mechanism accountable for ﬁlament
formation also resembles that of coronal rain due to condensation yet in diﬀerent rate. Filament mass is maintained
by condensation at a high rate of 1010 g s−1 (Liu et al. 2012). In coronal rain the temperature transition of coronal
loops along their height and the falling sunward blobs could be observed through AIA 171 ˚A and 304 ˚A oﬀ-limb
observation(Vashalomidze et al. 2015). Compared to coronal rain blobs which are relatively loose and faint, those
threads of ﬁlaments downﬂows are much more continuous and denser.

Filament drainage is a common phenomenon either in quiescent phase or in eruption phase. They are parts of the
coronal cycle (Berger et al. 2010), being balanced by the ubiquitous upﬂows and condensation. Their speed can be
as low as 5 km s−1 (Parenti & Vial 2014). strong draining can be observed in eruption phase. Huang et al. (2014)
observed the ﬁlament drainage in pre-eruption phase. Such drainage in pre-eruption phase has also been reported
by Bi et al. (2014). Large-amplitude ﬁlament oscillation was observed in pre-eruption phase, and followed by the
substantial material drainage prior to eruption. The authors suggested that drainage could play a role in the slow-to-
fast transition of ﬁlament eruption.

The ﬁne-structure (<500 km) ﬁlament drainage can help to understand the eruption mechanism, yet have been rarely
observed due to lack of high spatial resolution observation. In this paper, the high-resolution Hα data are from the 1.6
m New Solar Telescope (NST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) that achieves 0.1” spatial resolution. We
observe one end of a small ﬁlament in an AR. During the ﬁve hour observation period, we see the ﬁlament ascending
and strong consequential downﬂows towards this end. Unfortunately LOS velocity from doppler measurement cannot
be deduced due to lack of Hα red wing observation, but we can still ﬁnd out the characteristics of the strong downﬂows
before eruption by considering the local magnetic ﬁeld topology and identify the potential role of the drainage as a
pre-eruption precursor.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA DESCRIPTION
The main data source is Hα images from the Visible Imaging Spectrometer (VIS) at NST. In earlier years of
its operation, NST was operated with the 76-element Adaptive Optics System(Goode et al. 2010).
In the visible
wavelengths, NST achieved a spatial resolution around 0.05” after using 100 frames for speckle reconstruction. The
cadence of data is 15 sec. On 2012 July 5, the Hα observations were made through a tunable ﬁlter at two wavelengths:
Hα line center (=6562.808 ˚A) and 0.75 ˚A oﬀ band in the blue wing. NST has a limited FOV around 50” × 50”,
therefore it only covers a fraction of the targeted AR 11515. In addition, observations are also made in TiO band (a
proxy for the continuum photosphere at 7057 ˚A). The full-disk Hα line center images were also obtained at BBSO
with a separate telescope with a cadence of one minute, and a pixel size in the order of 1”. A small AR ﬁlament is
visible, one end of the ﬁlament is located in NST FOV at the edge of the largest sunspot of the region (see Figure 1).
It is worth noting that a M1.6 ﬂare occurred at 21:39 UT, covered by NST observations.

We also analyze the EUV images obtained from the AIA on board Solar Dynamic Observatory(SDO), in particular,
the EUV images at the wavelength of 171 ˚A and 304 ˚A, which correspond to the corona and upper chromosphere of
the Sun, respectively. The 171 ˚A band is mainly from Fe IX line, with the characteristic temperature of 105.8 K, while
the 304 ˚A is HeII line, with the characteristic temperature of 104.7 K (Lemen et al. 2012).

To understand the magnetic structure, we analyzed the vector magnetograph data from HMI on board SDO by
conducting NLFFF extrapolation. Non-linear force free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation model assumes that the corona is
static and free of Lorenz Force: J×B=0. And the currents must be aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld: ▽×B=αB, where

α is the non linear coeﬃcient. Under NLFFF approximation, by assuming the Lorentz forces negligible, α varies in
space, and ﬁeld evolves slowly through a series of quasi-equilibrium states (Metcalf et al. 2008)

We used hmi.sharp_cea_720s series data which are disambiguated vector magnetograms with a pixel size of 0.5′′.
It converts data as (Br,Bθ,Bφ) in a heliocentric spherical coordinate corresponding to (Bz,-By,Bx) in the heliographic
coordinates (Sun 2013) through cylindrical equal area (CEA) projection. We congrid the magnetograms to 2.25′′ pixel
and preprocess the data toward a suitable boundary condition to achieve nearly force-free conditions (Wiegelmann et al.

2006). Optimization code with weighting function was also conducted (Wiegelmann 2004). The extrapolation was
performed within a computational domain of 256×100×200 uniform grid points, corresponding to ∼450×175×350
Mm3.

The most important part of data processing is to trace ﬂow speed of plasma motions based on Hα observation. We
assume that the plasma motion follows magnetic ﬁeld lines. This is generally true when plasma pressure is much less
than magnetic pressure, The detailed procedure to track the ﬂows including the correction of projection eﬀect will be
discussed in the next section.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Downﬂowing Threads at the Filament End
Figure 1 shows the ﬁlament in NOAA AR 11515 on July 05, 2012, as seen in Hα (Figure 1(a)(b)), AIA 171 ˚A (Figure
1(c)) and 304 ˚A (Figure 1(d)). In particular, the FOV of the NST/VIS high-resolution Hα observation covers one end
of the ﬁlament (Figure 1(a)) from 16:41 to 22:22 UT. The ﬁlament eruption was associated with a ﬂare at 21:39:00UT.
In Figure 1(c)(d), the ﬁlament is seen in AIA 304 ˚A as a dense loop consisting of dark materials, which shows the
low temperature property of the ﬁlament. Rapid temperature transition from 1 MK to 0.05 MK was observed by
Vashalomidze et al. (2015). For this event, however, no clear temperature transition can be determined, which may

imply a diﬀerent driver mechanism. The sunspot contours are obtained from HMI white light images. The downﬂow
trajectories are marked in green lines. NST data provides details of ﬁlament threads (white box) and green lines’
footpoints (red circles) (Figure 1(a)). The FOV of NST data is marked in red in Figure 1(b). We observe persistent
downﬂows along the ﬁlament threads four hours before the eruption. In Figure 2, We used the moving plasma blobs
as a tracer of the downﬂow threads, and tracked the trajectories of the head (or tail) of these blobs as shown in Figure
2 (a – h). In this example, about 15 points in average are pinned to determine each trajectory over a period of ∼150
seconds. The trajectories of four sample downﬂow threads are shown in Figure 2 (e – h).

Figure 2(i - l) show space-time diagrams of the curved trajectories of the downﬂow blobs. We ﬁt the trajectories with
a linear function, The slope represents the average plane-of-sky velocity. Acceleration is hard to see in the diagrams,
indicating nearly constant plane-of-sky velocity of the blobs. The upper thread has larger velocity than the lower
thread, which implies that outer threads holding faster downﬂows than inner threads. We further estimate the real
velocity and acceleration in §3.2.

blobs in total from four hours before until ten minutes before the eruption. It is not easy to trace the blobs during
the ﬂare eruption due to dramatic intensity enhancement. The downﬂow velocity ranges from 28 to 63 km s−1, with
a mean velocity of 45 km s−1. Outer threads host faster downﬂows than inner threads. Low velocity part is from 28
to 40 km s−1, within the range of other ﬁlament plane-of-sky velocities (see Joshi et al. (2013); Parenti & Vial (2014);
Kucera (2015)). The materials with high velocity in the range of 50 to 63 km s−1 occupied along the outer threads.
They may suggest that the high velocities are augmented by the general upward motion associated with the slow-rise
phase. The velocity of downﬂows does not vary dramatically during the four hours before the eruption from large-scale
perspective. The small-scale inconstancy of velocity distribution can help explain the merge and split of those dark
materials when they are moving along designated paths.

3.2. Filament foot real velocity

We use NLFFF extrapolation to deduce local magnetic ﬁeld. The spatial scale of NLFFF is 2.25”, much coarser
than that of high resolution Hα images. In Figure 4 extrapolated ﬁeld lines at 18:48:00 UT are selected to ﬁt ballistic
trajectories of downﬂows. The ballistic trajectory matches extrapolated ﬁelds within the FOV of the high resolution
Hα data. We see many dense materials moving along the ﬁeld lines. We chose these ﬁve NLFFF lines because their
footpoints are close to Brightening Zones (BZs) and hence can help us identify whether these downﬂow threads are
actually landing upon BZs. The peak height of ﬁeld lines ranges from 5 Mm to 15 Mm, which could be the lower limit
of the altitude of the ﬁlament spine. Assuming the mass motion follows NLFFF lines, we ﬁnd that the de-projected
velocity is in a range of 40–80 km s−1, with a mean of 56 km s−1. Both inner threads and outer threads have faster
downﬂows than that in quiescent phase (Kucera 2015; Parenti & Vial 2014). Due to high level of activity before or
during eruption,Local ﬁeld topology may lead to the nonuniform distribution of the velocity. Figure 5 shows the
location of the ﬁlament over SDO/HMI LOS magnetogram. The spine of the ﬁlament lies along the PILs while the
materials at the end moves along the magnetic ﬁeld lines tending to cross the PILs. This suggests that the dense
materials may accumulate at the magnetic ﬁeld dips above the PIL, and then slide oﬀ along the ﬁlament end.

To calculate total kinetic energy of the downﬂows directly ﬂowing into BZs, we assume that the trajectory is a tilted
axis-symmetric cylinder when ﬂows are close to surface. Electron density of the ﬁlament is 109 - 1011 cm−3 (Hirayama

and proton mass mp=1.67×10−24g. Mass density ℓ0=nemp= 1.33×10-14 g cm-3. A = 1.32 Mm2 was chosen from the
lower limit of the BZ’s area, which is determined by 95% of peak intensity. The kinetic energy per second (KE) of
downﬂow reaching upon the BZ is estimated to be 5.6×1021∼4.5×1022 ergs. 5.6×1021 ergs is regarded as the lower
limit of the kinetic energy per second through the BZs.

Figure 6 shows the temporal evolution of the ﬁlament before eruption. We can see one end of the ﬁlament anchored
at the sunspot (AR 11515) ascending while the other end and the spine part keeping stationary. Arch-like expansion
is one of the main procedures an entire pre-ﬂare ﬁlament may undergo (Ramsey & Smith 1963). In a case study by
Kleint et al. (2015), a ﬁlament shows blue-shifted Doppler velocities of 1–10 km s−1 at the pre-eruption phase. Since
the downﬂow threads are conﬁned to the magnetic ﬁelds, the expansion and ascent of the ﬁlament arcade lead to more

are ﬁtted for the plane-of-sky velocities of the ﬁlament in the slow-rise phase and the end of the fast-rise phase respectively.
Yellow lines show the duration of high-resolution Hα observation, wherein the time interval from 16:41 UT to 20:51 UT is the
eﬀective duration for tracking the downﬂow blobs, the time interval from 16:41 UT to 22:22 UT is the overall observation. Green

radial magnetic ﬁeld lines and downﬂow threads injection. Therefore, more dense materials could be poured downward
back to lower chromospheric layer, resulting in drainage.

The slit image shown in Figure 7 left panel is derived from SDO/AIA 304 ˚A images along the dashed line shown in
Figure 1(d). The right panel shows the GOES X-ray ﬂux of the M1.6 ﬂare peak at 21:45 UT. The Filament started
to ascend from ∼15:10 UT until the eruption at ∼21:30 UT. Slow-rise phase started from ∼15:10 UT with an average
plane-of-sky velocity of 0.8 km s−1 and the fast-rise phase started at ∼20:20 UT until the eruption with a ﬁnal plane-
of-sky velocity of 12 km s−1. It is worth mentioning that the rising velocities are probably severely underestimated
due to projection eﬀects. In a limb event where projection eﬀects are less pronounced (McCauley et al. 2015), the
average slow-rise and fast-rise velocities of a prominence are 2.1 and 106 km s−1 respectively, both of which are higher
than our results, 0.8 and 12 km s−1. The high-resolution Hα observation starts from 16:41:47 UT to 22:22:47 UT, and
the eﬀective duration for tracking downﬂow blobs starts from 16:41:47 UT to 20:41:47 UT, which mostly covers the
slow-rise phase. Considering cross-sectional area A to be ∼300 Mm2, we estimated the mass draining rate A·ℓ0·v, which
is 2.2·1011g·s−1 and 4.0·1015g for 5 hours continuous draining during the ﬁlament slow-rise phase. This is comparable
to the ﬁlament clump mass ∼ 1015g reported by Bi et al. (2014). The draining rate is faster than ∼1015g·day−1 in a
non-eruptive ﬁlament studied by Liu et al. (2012). It drains away certain fraction of the ﬁlament mass that is required
to conﬁne the magnetic structure, thus may trigger the transition into fast-rise phase. As some models indicated
(Fong et al. 2002; Low et al. 2003; Petrie & Low 2005), ﬁlament drainage facilitates the eruption. The ﬂare begins
after the slow-to-fast rise phase transition. It may rule out the ﬂare as a potential trigger for the ﬁlament eruption.
This is diﬀerent from the event reported by Nagashima et al. (2007), in which a C2.9 ﬂare that occurred when the
ﬁlament was close to the critical point for loss of equilibrium lead to the ﬁlament eruption. It should be noted that
though the potential roles of the torus and kink instabilities are not discussed here, they can still be responsible for
triggering the fast-rise phase. In such a way, the persistent downﬂows may make the ﬁlament rise further to meet the
critical point for the instabilities.

3.4. Chromospheric brightening

Gilbert et al. (2013) reported the chromospheric brightenings as the response to the impact of falling material from a
partial ﬁlament eruption. It was proposed that the plasma compression is the dominant mechanism responsible for the
observed brightenings. Here small-scale BZs are also observed associated with the ﬁlament downﬂows from 16:41:47
UT to 21:19:24 UT in the high-resolution observation. Three main BZs of characteristic length of ∼1.5′′ are marked

in Figure 1(a) and Figure 8. The BZs reside at the foot points of numerous downﬂow threads which are marked by
dashed lines. The BZs may result from plasma heating due to the kinetic energy of the falling material. Unfortunately
the BZs that are just barely resolved in AIA images are shaded by ﬁlament dark features, which makes it diﬃcult to
derive the radiated energy of the BZs from DEM. Figure 9 shows the temporal evolution of the total Hα intensity over
the area of BZs with/without subtracting background contrast. Background ﬂuctuation does not aﬀect the timing of
brightenings. The size of these BZs kept relatively constant. In addition, these BZs recur successively, with an average
lifetime of 20 min. Both lifetime and size of these BZs are 1 order of magnitude greater than those of the brightening
footpoints of post-ﬂare downﬂows, as reported by Jing et al. (2016).

4. CONCLUSION
To summarize, high-resolution NST Hα observation of NOAA AR11515 revealed strong unidirectional downﬂows
towards one end of the ﬁlament at the pre-eruption phase of the ﬁlament. The ballistic trajectories of downﬂows keep
steady except for a gradual ascent before the ﬁlament eruption. The extrapolated NLFFF lines near the AR end
match well with the ballistic trajectories of downﬂow threads, which helps estimate the real velocities of the downﬂow
threads. Since our high-resolution observation started after the onset of the slow-rise phase, we are unable to identify
whether ﬁlament drainage facilitate the onset of the slow-rise phase or vise versa. However, as the persistent drainage
accompanied with the slow-rise phase as early as at least ∼4 hours before jumping into fast-rise phase, we believe that
the drainage not only contributes to ﬁlament slow-to-fast-rise phase transition (e.g. Bi et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2014),
but also maintains or even accelerates the slow-rise-phase. Slow-rise phase is often attributed to increasing twist in
the ﬂux rope (Low et al. 2003; Fong et al. 2002), which results in an upward force, that is essential for the eventual
loss of equilibrium. Pre-eruptive drainage, accompanied with the slow-rise phase, could be regarded as a precursor to
the eruption. Successive brightenings were observed on the chromosphere when impacted by the falling material. The
plasma heating due to the dissipation of kinetic energy into the chromosphere via compression is a more accountable

 
 
 
mechanism for the observed brightenings. We speculate that downﬂows towards one ﬁlament footpoint result from the
draining eﬀect of the ascending ﬁlament prior to its eruption, and might be a precursor to eruptive events.
