The broad tunability of the proximity exchange eﬀect between transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) and chromium iodide (CrI3) heterostructures oﬀers intriguing possibilities for the use of
TMDCs in two-dimensional magnetoelectrics. In this work, the inﬂuence of the twist angle and the
gate electric ﬁeld on the electric and thermal transport in a TMDC/CrI3 junction is investigated
using the Dirac -Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We show that signiﬁcant amounts can be controlled
by spin-splitting of band structures due to spin-orbit interaction, and that the exchange-splitting
of bands arises from the proximity eﬀect. The property of the Andreev reﬂection (AR) process
is highly dependent on the spin valley polarized states due to spin-orbit coupling. Remarkably,
perfect spin valley polarized AR is possible over a wide bias range by using a gate voltage to tune
the local Fermi energy and varying the type of charge doping. The proposed structure with p-
type doping is found to have larger spin valley polarized Andreev conductance and high thermal
conductance. We further show that, depending on the TMDC material and chemical potential
of the TMDC/CrI3 layer, twisting can lead to suppression or a signiﬁcant increase in Andreev
conductance as well as enhancement of thermal conductance for chemical potentials smaller than
that of the superconducting regime.

INTRODUCTION

The fascinating research on two-dimensional (2D) ma-
terials has recently experienced a modern stage in its
development, represented by a new degree of freedom
in terms of material structure: A twist angle between
adjacent layers that facilitates ﬁne-tuning of electronic
properties of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures [1–4].
The most prominent example is the magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene, which exhibits magnetism [5] and su-
perconductivity [6, 7] due to strong correlations. vdW
heterostructures, comprising a variety of 2D layered ma-
terials, have emerged as potential building blocks for fu-
ture ultrafast and low-power electronic and spintronic de-
vices [8–10].

Twistronics is now demonstrating its potential
for
proximity eﬀects. For 2D spintronics and the emerg-
ing ﬁeld of superconducting spintronics, it is desirable
to integrate 2D materials such as graphene and transi-
tion metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2D magnets.
It turns out that twisting has a profound inﬂuence on
both the size and the nature of the proximity-induced
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the graphene/TMDC het-
erostructure [11] as well as on the proximity ex-
change coupling in graphene/Cr2Ge2Te6 heterostruc-
ture and formation of antiferromagnetic Dirac bands in
graphene [12].

from it and broken inversion symmetry [13–16]. Recent
experiments show a proximity exchange of a few meV
in TMDC and CrI3 heterostructures.
Interestingly,
the CrI3 monolayer is a ferromagnet [17–19], while
the CrI3 bilayer exhibits an antiferromagnetic cou-
pling [18, 20, 21]. Unlike thin ﬁlms of conventional
ferromagnets,
the 2D layered ferromagnets exhibit
out-of-plane magnetization, which is a time-reversal
breaking analog of the Zeeman splitting in TMDCs.
Remarkably, wide tunability of the proximity exchange
coupling has been reported in TMDC/CrI3 heterostruc-
tures through controlling the interlayer twist between
layers and electrostatic gating [22].

On the other hand, the transfer of the low-energy elec-
trons through a nonsuperconducting/superconducting
transition is dominated by a peculiar and fascinating
type of fundamental reﬂection process, the Andreev re-
ﬂection (AR) [23, 24], in which an incident electron with
spin polarization s, when hitting the interface, is retro-
reﬂected as a hole with opposite spin polarization ¯s and a
Cooper pair is transferred to the superconductor. Since
the Cooper pair carries a charge of 2e and no heat, the
peculiar AR process leads to an increase in electrical con-
ductance and suppression of thermal conductance [25–
27]. In particular, due to the interplay of superconduc-
tivity and the unique electronic structure of atomically
thin 2D material, novel interesting phenomena appear
when superconducting heterostructures are realized in
2D crystals. Many theoretical and experimental works
have found peculiar AR processes at low energies [28–
35] and nonlocal processes have been predicted to occur
under diﬀerent conditions [32, 33, 36–41].

Motivated by the aforementioned physical phenomena,
the main aim of this article is to present a comprehensive
theoretical study of charge and heat transport through

a ferromagnetic (F) /superconducting (S) junction made
of proximity exchange-coupled TMDC/CrI3 heterostruc-
ture as ferromagnet and superconducting TMDC (with
WSe2 and MoSe2 as TMDC) and to focus on the ef-
fect of charge doping, twisting the CrI3 monolayer rel-
ative to TMDC layer, and applying a transverse elec-
tric ﬁeld to the magnetized TMDC, and ﬁnding a suit-
able experimental set up with desired transport proper-
ties. Indeed, these have a wide range of uses. Magnetic-
superconducting heterostructures based on 2D vdW ma-
terials are the vital building blocks in the design of ultra-
compact spintronic and superconducting spintronic de-
vices, with potential applications in quantum comput-
ing [8–10, 42–44]. On the other hand, twisting the neigh-
boring layers with respect to each other facilitates the ﬁne
tuning of electronic properties of the vdW heterostruc-
tures while the individual materials also preserve a great
degree of autonomy. Importantly, wide tunability of the
proximity exchange in monolayer MoSe2 and WSe2 owing
to a ferromagnetic monolayer CrI3 with respect to twist-
ing and gating is an advantage of the TMDC/CrI3 struc-
ture relative to other ferromagnetic structures, in which
constant and equal proximity-induced exchange interac-
tions are supposed in the conduction and valence bands.
Using Dirac-Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (DBdG) formal-
ism, we reveal the possibility of a perfect AR for a wide
range of chemical potentials within the F region by tun-
ing the bias and using the gate voltage to estimate the
local Fermi energy and vary the type of charge doping in
the F and S regions. For an F/S structure with p- or n-
type doping, a perfect AR can be electrically controlled
and visualized over a wide bias range; it can be achieved
for subgap biases (eVbias < ∆S) at the deﬁned F-region
chemical potential, µF , and for a wide range of µF , if
eVbias = ∆S. In the case of F and S regions with diﬀer-
ent types of charge doping, a perfect AR can be achieved
by raising the chemical potential of the S regions of al-
most all values of µF if eVbias = ∆S. Due to the existing
spin-orbit interaction in the TMDC layer, the AR process
with full spin valley polarization is equally possible for a
deﬁned range of the F-region chemical potential while
considerable damping of the Andreev conductance and
hence imperfect AR occurs in the absence of the SOC
term in the F region.

We show that the probability of AR and accordingly
the Andreev diﬀerential conductance can be suppressed
in the spin valley polarized AR regime and increased in
the nonpolarized regime by twisting. Most importantly,
the rotation angle-induced changes in Andreev conduc-
tance strongly depend on the value of the subgap bias as
well as the TMDC material: It increases with bias at the
deﬁned F-region chemical potential in the MoSe2-based
structure, while it decreases with prestress and tends to
zero for other values of µF in both MoSe2- and WSe2-
based structures when eVbias = ∆S. Furthermore, the
presence of the positively applied electric ﬁeld in the fer-
romagnetic region dampens the Andreev conductance by
increasing the proximity exchange coupling.

2

Next, we examine the heat transport properties of the
proposed structure by evaluating the thermal conduc-
tance. The thermal conductance maintains an increasing
behavior with temperature and disappears at tempera-
tures well below the critical temperature of the super-
conducting order parameter. Importantly, twisting can
lead to a signiﬁcant increase in thermal conductance in
F/S structures with a p-doped F region and a decrease in
it in the corresponding structure with n-type doping be-
cause the chemical potentials of the F region are smaller
than those of the superconducting region. However, gat-
ing slightly reduces the thermal conductance of p-doped
structures and does not cause signiﬁcant changes in the
case of n-doped F/S junctions. Furthermore, we analyze
the inﬂuence of the type of charge doping on the trans-
port properties of the proposed structure and demon-
strate the high charge and thermal conductance of the
WSe2 and MoSe2 based structures with p-type doping.

Finally, we compare the results of the WSe2-based
structure with those of the corresponding MoSe2-based
structure and observe the enhancement of the thermal
conductance and damping of the Andreev conductance
in the p-doped MoSe2-based structure as well as reduc-
ing the thermal conductance with the n-doped structure.
We should note that diﬀerent qualitative behaviors arise
for the chemical potential dependence of both Andreev
and thermal conductance by varying the type of charge
doping in the F and S regions and the SOC term in the
F region. In addition, changing the TMDC material also
leads to a diﬀerent µF -dependence of the thermal con-
ductance.

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section
II is devoted to the theoretical model and fundamental
formalisms which will be implemented to investigate AR
in a twisted TMDC/CrI3-superconducting TMDC junc-
tion.
III, we present our numerical results for
the Andreev diﬀerential conductance and the thermal
conductance of the proposed structures. Finally, a brief
summary of results is given in Sec. IV.

In Sec.

II. THEORETICAL FORMALISM

We consider a wide ballistic F/S junction normal to
the x axis with proximity exchange-coupled TMDC/CrI3
heterostructure (as F region) for x < 0 and supercon-
ducting TMDC (as S region) extending over the x > 0
region (with WSe2 and MoSe2 as TMDC). The magnetic
insulator substrate CrI3 is weakly coupled to the TMDC
by vdW forces, preserving the characteristic electronic
band structure of the TMDC. The proximity exchange
coupling splits the conduction and valence bands of the
TMDC by roughly 1-5 meV and combined with the in-
trinsic (valley Zeeman) SOC of the TMDC lifts the valley
degeneracy [22]. The eﬀective low-energy Hamiltonian
which describes the proximity eﬀects in TMDC due to

CrI3, has the form [22]

H = H0 + H∆ + Hsoc + Hex + HR,
H0 = (cid:126)vFs0 ⊗ (τ σxkx + σyky),

H∆ =

s0 ⊗ σz,

Hsoc = τ sz ⊗ (λcσ+ + λvσ−),
Hex = −sz ⊗ (Bcσ+ + Bvσ−),
HR = λR(τ sy ⊗ σx − sx ⊗ σy).

Here τ = ±1 is the valley index for the K (K’) point
and vF represents the Fermi velocity. The pseudospin
Pauli matrices σi (i = 0, x, y, z) act on the conduction
and valence-band subspaces and si (i = 0, x, y, z) refers
to real spin. The parameter ∆ denotes the orbital gap of
the spectrum. The spin-splitting of the conduction and
valence bands due to the intrinsic SOC are determined
by the parameters λc and λv, respectively. Proximity ex-
change eﬀects are presented with Bc and Bv describing
the proximity-induced exchange splitting of the conduc-
tion and valence bands. The Rashba SOC parameter λR
is due to the presence of the inversion asymmetry in the
heterostructure. For the sake of simplicity, we introduce
σ± = (σ0 ± σz)/2.

Recently, wide tunability of the proximity exchange
in monolayer MoSe2 and WSe2 owing to a ferromag-
netic monolayer CrI3 has been explored with respect to
twisting and gating [22].
In particular, proximity ex-
change splittings depend on the twist angle between the
TMDC and the CrI3. Not only do the magnitudes of
the exchange diﬀer, but also, remarkably, the direction
of the exchange ﬁeld for the valence band changes sign.
Moreover, the proximity exchange parameters increase
when the electric ﬁeld is turned from negative to posi-
tive values, which enables the gate control of proximity
exchange. We should mention that the gap parameter
as well as the Fermi velocity are unaﬀected by external
electric ﬁelds.

The S part can be produced by depositing a supercon-
ducting electrode on the top of the TMDC sheet [45].
In this region, exchange parameters are zero and the
proximity-induced superconducting correlations are char-
acterized by the superconducting pair potential (order
parameter) ∆S.

We assume perfectly ﬂat and clean interfaces in the
proposed structure. Transport takes place in the x direc-
tion and is described by the DBdG equation [28, 31]

where µ(r) = µ0 − U (r). Considering the electrostatic
potential U (r) to be −U0 in the S region and U (r) = 0 in
the F region, the doping proﬁle throughout the junction
is set by diﬀerent but constant chemical potentials in the
S and F regions. The same assumption is used in the
self-consistent solution of the DBdG equation to avoid a
signiﬁcant amount of complexity to the problem [46–48].
The electron and hole wave functions, us,τ and v¯s,¯τ , are
two-component spinors of the form (ψc, ψv) where c and
v respectively denote the conduction and valence bands,
¯s = −s and ¯τ = −τ . Therefore the electron excitations
in one valley are coupled by the superconducting pair
potential ∆S to hole excitations in the other valley. The
superconducting phase ϕ only plays a role in junctions
with several superconductors, and hence we omit it here.
The pair potential is zero in the F region, which rep-
resents a reasonable approximation if the superconduct-
ing coherence length is appreciably larger than the Fermi
wavelength. Inside the S region, the proximity induced
pair potential ∆S(r) reaches its bulk value ∆S at a dis-
tance from the interface which becomes negligibly small
if the Fermi wavelength in the S region is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the value in the F region. Therefore neglect-
ing the decay of the order parameter in the vicinity of the
interface, the step-function model for ∆S(r) is valid for
length scales much longer than the superconducting co-
herence length [28, 49, 50]. In the case of moderate Fermi
level mismatch, self-consistent calculations have demon-
strated that increasing the chemical potential of the nor-
mal (N) region leads to weekly doping dependence of the
local density of states and therefore the pair potential
inside the S region of the graphene-based S/N/S struc-
tures [47] and conﬁrmed that the sharp interface between
the regions can represent an appropriate approximation.
Moreover, the self-consistent DBdG approach to accu-
rately determine the spatial proﬁle of the pair poten-
tial is favorable in ﬁnite sized structures where quantum
scale oscillations play a role and has signiﬁcant conse-
quences for quasiparticle bound states, and supercurrent
ﬂow [46–48]. On the other hand, the doping level as
well as the width of the S region can have substantial ef-
fects on the critical temperature of the superconductivity,
TC. It has been demonstrated by self-consistent calcula-
tions that decreasing the Fermi level mismatch, by tuning
the doping level in the N region of ﬁnite sized graphene-
based S/N/S junction, leads to substantial variations of
TC for S regions that occupy a fraction of the coher-
ence length whereas it has no detrimental eﬀect for large
lengths of the S region [47]. Besides, the experimental re-
sults of the gate-modulated Andreev conductance across
the low-disorder vdW interface between graphene and

the superconducting NbSe2 are in good qualitative and
quantitative agreement with the theoretical model based
on the non-self-consistent DBdG equation with step func-
tion model for the pair potential and constant chemical
potential [34]. Therefore in the proposed F/S structure
with semi-inﬁnite S and F regions, it is reasonable to as-
sume that the pair potential is constant in the S region
and zero in the F region and adopts the step-function
model of ∆S(r) = ∆SΘ(x) for the pair potential.

To study AR at the F/S interface within the scatter-
ing formalism, we ﬁrst construct the quasiparticle wave
functions that participate in the scattering processes. Ac-
cording to Eq. (8), the dynamics of the low-energy itin-
erant charge carriers inside the F region with spin s from
valley τ are described by eﬀective Hamiltonians H e
s,τ and
H h

The Rashba parameter λR is set to zero since there is no
in-plane component of the spin expectation value around
the band edges, and therefore it is unnecessary to capture
the essentials of the band structure for the TMDC/CrI3
stacks. At a given energy ε and a transverse momentum

In pristine TMDC monolayers, the two valleys are the
same due to the time-reversal symmetry. The vicinity
to the 2D magnetic material CrI3 provides a direct and
eﬀective way to break the valley degeneracy of TMDC
because of the magnetic proximity eﬀect. The presence
of negative proximity exchange ﬁeld in TMDC/CrI3 het-
erostucture [22] shifts the spin-s subband of the τ (¯τ )
valley upward and the spin-¯s subband of the τ (¯τ ) val-
ley downward in the conduction and valence bands, re-
spectively, by |Bc| and |Bv|.
In contrast, twisting the
CrI3 layer with respect to the monolayer TMDC replaces
the sign of the proximity exchange in the valence band
(see Table. I) and therefore brings the spin-subbands of
the τ -valley close to each other and gets those of the ¯τ
valley far away from each other. Therefore the proxim-
ity exchange coupling adjusts the valley splitting and the
TMDC/CrI3 heterostructure shows valley polarization of
the TMDC [40, 51].

Inside the S region, the solutions are rather mixed
electron-hole excitations (called Dirac-Bogoliubov quasi-
particles) that either decay exponentially as x → ∞ (for
subgap solutions when ε ≤ ∆S) or propagate along the x
direction (for supragap solutions when ε > ∆S). These
solutions for the n-doped S region take the form

An incident electron from the conduction band of n-
doped F region with a subgap energy 0 ≤ ε ≤ ∆S could
undergo two possible scattering events. It can either be
normally reﬂected as an electron in the conduction band
via normal reﬂection (NR) or be Andreev reﬂected as a
hole in the same band with opposite spin and diﬀerent
valley index via retro AR. Depending on the magnitude
of the chemical potential µF and the excitation energy ε,
the incident electron and the reﬂected hole can be from
one or two of the spin subbands. As long as Es,¯τ

τ valleys), only the lower spin subbands with s = −τ = 1
and s = −τ = −1 contribute to the transport of charge
and result in a spin valley polarized AR process with sτ =
−1. For the case of µF ≥ Es,τ
c −ε, the Fermi level crosses
the two spin subbands of τ and ¯τ valleys with sτ = ±1
and, therefore, the AR process is not spin valley polarized
while in the case of p-type doped F region, the charge
transport is determined by incoming electrons from the

Matching the wave functions of the F and S regions at
the interface x = 0, the scattering coeﬃcients for the nor-
mal and AR processes can be obtained. Having known
the reﬂection coeﬃcients, we investigate the charge and
thermal conductance of the F/S interface in the following
section.

We should mention that earlier works in this ﬁeld [31,
40, 51], have studied the transport characteristics of
the MoS2-based heterostructures by supposing an equal
proximity exchange splitting in the conduction and va-
lence bands, Bc and Bv, and ignoring the SOC-induced
spin-splitting in the conduction band, λc, while in this
paper, we employ an eﬀective Hamiltonian which fully
describes the band structure of the TMDC/CrI3 het-
erostructure (with WSe2 and MoSe2 as TMDC) in the
presence of diﬀerent λc and λv as well as diﬀerent
proximity-induced exchange interactions Bc and Bv. Sig-
niﬁcantly, another advantage of the proposed structure is

5

that twisting the monolayer CrI3 relative to the TMDC
layer and applying a gate electric ﬁeld to the TMDC/CrI3
heterostructure are eﬃcient tenable knobs to tailor the
sign and magnitude of the proximity exchange interac-

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we mainly study the charge and ther-
mal transport in the proposed F/S interface with the
subgap energy regime. We concentrate on the Andreev
diﬀerential conductance as well as the thermal conduc-
tance in the junction. Before presenting our numerical
results, we should mention that the orbital gap ∆, SOC
λc(v), and the exchange interaction Bc(v) parameters for
diﬀerent TMDCs (like WSe2 and MoSe2) are set to the
values obtained in Ref.

[22] (see Table. I).

Due to the vicinity to the 2D magnetic material, the
magnetization direction of the TMDC is the same as in
the I atoms of the monolayer CrI3, but opposite to the
Cr atoms, resulting in a negative proximity exchange pa-
rameter. The absence or presence of the SOC term in
the heterostructure calculations does not aﬀect signiﬁ-
cant changes in the magnitude of the exchange param-
eters. However, twisting the CrI3 layer relative to the
TMDC changes the sign of the exchange ﬁeld in the va-
lence band and makes the valence-band spin-splitting to
be opposite in sign in the absence of SOC. The magnitude
of the proximity exchange Bv increases with twisting in
the WSe2-based heterostructure whereas it decreases in
the MoSe2-based heterostructure. Therefore twisting can
remain an eﬀective tool to modify the proximity exchange
ﬁeld. Since the parameters in the presence of the SOC
in the heterostructure are barely varied from those of the
heterostructure without SOC, we set ∆ = 1.417(1.351)
eV, λc = 13.81(−9.675) meV, λv = 240.99(94.43) meV,
Bc = −1.648(−1.641) meV and Bv = 1.896(0.502) meV
for the twisted WSe2 (MoSe2)/CrI3 heterostructure with
SOC.

The chemical potentials µF and µS are in units of elec-
tron volt (eV). For practical applications in electronic
devices, the single layer and multilayer TMDCs can be
n- or p-type doped on generating desirable charge carri-
ers [52, 53]. We set the zero-temperature superconduct-
ing order-parameter ∆S = 1 meV and scale the excita-
tion energy, ε, in units of ∆S and the temperature T is in
units of the critical temperature of the superconducting
order-parameter TC.

A. Electrical conductance

To study electrical transport, we assume that the F
region is in contact with a biased reservoir, and that the
S region is in contact with a reference reservoir. Apply-
ing a bias voltage Vbias through the junction induces an

Figure 1(a) shows the behavior of the normalized An-
dreev conductance G/G0 of p-doped WSe2-based struc-
ture in terms of the magnitude of the chemical poten-
tial inside the F region |µF | when the chemical potential
of the S region is set to µS = −1 eV. There is a wide
gap in Andreev conductance owing to the orbital gap
in the band structure of WSe2.
Increasing the chemi-
cal potential of the F region leads to an enhancement
of the zero-bias Andreev conductance and perfect AR

with G/G0 = 2 occurs at |µF | = |µS|. Henceforth, it
undergoes a decreasing behavior for |µF | > |µS|. Signiﬁ-
cantly, a cusplike behavior occurs at the edge of the spin-¯s
valley-τ of the valence band with E ¯s,τ
v = Bv − λv − ∆/2,
such that for |µF | < |E ¯s,τ
v − eVbias| the AR process is
spin valley polarized (spin-polarized in each valley, with
sτ = 1). For subgap biases, the probability of the AR
process and, therefore, the Andreev conductance increase
by enhancing the eVbias/∆S ratio and perfect AR occurs
for a broad range of the chemical potential |µF | ≤ |µS|,
when eVbias/∆S = 1. The inset of Fig. 1(a) demon-
strates an enhancement of the Andreev conductance with
respect to the eVbias/∆S ratio for diﬀerent values of the
chemical potential µS, such that perfect AR happens for
all values of the subgap biases when |µS| = |µF |. The
Andreev conductance can be enhanced or reduced by in-
creasing the chemical potential of the S region depending
on the value of the bias voltage eVbias/∆S ratio. More-
over, it is presented in Fig. 1(b) that the behavior of
the Andreev conductance versus |µF | is extremely sen-
sitive to the value of the chemical potential inside the
S region. The Andreev conductance has an increasing
behavior with |µF | for large values of µS, while it ex-
periences a decreasing behavior after a sharp peak at
|µF | = |µS| for smaller values of µS.

interaction by applying a positive gate electric ﬁeld re-
duces the Andreev conductance and suppresses it in a
broader range of the chemical potential µF than that of
the twisted one [see the inset of Fig. 2(a)]. In addition,
it can be noted from Fig. 2(b) that the Andreev peak
reappears at |µF | = |µS| if we switch oﬀ the SOC term in
both F and S regions (gapped graphene-based structure).
Turning on the SOC term in both F and S regions
(WSe2-based structure) causes the cusp-like behavior of
the Andreev conductance as well as an Andreev peak
at |µF | = |µS| [see Fig. 2(b)]. Thereupon, the appear-
ance of the cusplike behavior in the Andreev conduc-
tance is due to the presence of SOC in the F region.

In the following, we evaluate the eﬀect of the twist
angle between the CrI3 and the WSe2 as well as the
applied transverse-electric ﬁeld on the AR process and
accordingly the Andreev conductance in the proposed
structure. To obtain the eﬀect of the twist angle, we
ﬁrst turn oﬀ the SOC parameter [see Fig. 2(a)]. The
absence of the SOC in the F region (magnetized gapped
graphene/superconducting WSe2 structure) leads to var-
ious features of the Andreev conductance; it attenuates
the Andreev conductance considerably, prevents the per-
fect AR process (with G/G0 = 2), and removes the cusp-
like behavior of the Andreev conductance. Most impor-
tantly, the twist angle-induced sign change of the prox-
imity exchange in the valence band, Bv, leads to the sup-
pression of the AR process and accordingly the Andreev
conductance immediately after the wide gap in compari-
son to that of the untwisted structure. In particular, en-

on the value of µF [see Fig. 2(c)]. Most importantly,
as illustrated in Fig. 2(d), attenuation of the Andreev
conductance in the presence of the twisting possesses its
maximum value at zero bias eVbias/∆S = 0, decreases
with enhancing the subgap bias and tends to zero for
eVbias/∆S = 1. However, in the case of µF = −0.91 eV
(cusp position), twisting leads to an ampliﬁcation of the
Andreev conductance even at eVbias/∆S = 1.

doping on the Andreev conductance of a WSe2-based

a wide zero conductance gap, spin valley polarized AR
process for a small range of |µF |, and enhanced zero-
bias Andreev conductance for |µF | > |µS| are seen. Sig-
niﬁcantly, AR process with unit eﬃciency occurs for a
smaller range of |µF | in contrast with that of the p-type
structure when eVbias/∆S = 1. On the other hand, a
strong reduction of the zero-bias Andreev conductance,
as well as diﬀerent qualitative behavior with nonperfect
AR for eVbias/∆S = 1, can be seen in the corresponding
structure with p-doped F and n-doped S regions. Inter-
estingly, we ﬁnd that the ampliﬁcation of the Andreev
conductance and accordingly the AR process with unit
eﬃciency (almost for all values of µF ) can be achieved for
p-doped F/n-doped S junction by enhancing the magni-
tude of the chemical potential inside the S region [see
Fig. 3(b)]. We have investigated the eﬀects of twisting,
type of charge doping and the gate electric ﬁeld on the
Andreev conductance of the corresponding MoSe2-based
F/S structure in Appendix A. Importantly, the absence
of the SOC term in the F region leads to a slight reduc-
tion of the Andreev conductance in contrast with that
of the corresponding WSe2-based structure. Astonish-
ingly, a twist angle induced ampliﬁcation of the Andreev
conductance will be increased with the subgap bias for
the chemical potential being at the cusp position. Com-

paring the results with those of the WSe2-based structure
demonstrates the suppression of the AR for a broad range
of the chemical potential µF as well as the reduction of
the Andreev conductance for other values of µF in the
MoSe2-based structure [see Fig. 4]. Note that due to
the strong spin-orbit interaction in the WSe2, the spin-
splitting of the valence band in WSe2-based structure is
considerably larger than that of the MoSe2 and causes
the cusplike behavior at larger values of µF compared
with that of the MoSe2-based structure.

erties of the proposed F/S structure. Applying a temper-
ature gradient ∆T through the junction, we can calculate

eV. It is noted that the thermal conductance, in con-
trast with the Andreev conductance, is suppressed by
AR at low temperatures. The physical reason is that
Cooper pairs carry a ﬁnite charge (2e) but zero heat
across the junction. For the thermal conductance to be
ﬁnite, the temperature must be so high that electron-
like and holelike quasiparticles can be transmitted into
the S region. Therefore the more signiﬁcant transmis-
sion of quasiparticles at higher temperatures results in an
increasing behavior of the thermal conductance with in-
creasing the temperature. It turns out that increasing the
magnitude of the chemical potential inside the F region
leads to the enhancement of the thermal conductance of
the n-doped F/S (p-doped F/n-doped S) structure for
µF ≤ µS (|µF | ≤ 0.8 µS) and reduction of it for µF > µS
(|µF | > 0.8 µS) [see Figs. 5(a) and 5(c)]. In contrast,
varying the type of doping in F and S regions from n-type
to p-type causes the thermal conductance of the p-doped
F/S structure to be increased or decreased with enhanc-
ing the chemical potential |µF | [see Fig. 5(b)]. More-
over, it is singled out from the inset of Fig. 5(a) that
enhancing the chemical potential µS tends to reduce the
thermal conductance. Comparing the results of thermal
conductance for F/S structures with various types of dop-
ing for F and S regions show that, in contrast with the
Andreev conductance, the n-doped F/S structure has a
very small thermal conductance and importantly the p-
doped structure possesses a signiﬁcant enhancement for
the thermal conductance in comparison with that of the
p-doped F/n-doped S structure [see Fig. 5(d)]. Similar
results are obtained for the corresponding MoSe2-based
F/S junctions with n-type S region [see Appendix B].
The diﬀerence is that enhancing the value of the chem-
ical potential inside the S region tends to increase the
thermal conductance. Also, the behavior of the thermal
conductance of the p-doped F/S structure is similar to
that of the p-doped F/n-doped S structure.

We further evaluate the eﬀect of the twist angle as
well as the gate electric ﬁeld on the thermal conductance
of WSe2- and MoSe2-based F/S junctions, respectively,
in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). It is worth noting that twisting
tends to enhance the thermal conductance of both WSe2-
and MoSe2-based structures with p-type doping, whereas
it reduces the thermal conductance of the corresponding
structures with n-type doping. The magnitude of the
proximity exchange coupling increases by applying a pos-
itive gate electric ﬁeld and produces an extremely small
reduction in the thermal conductance of both WSe2- and
MoSe2-based structures with p-type doping. Comparing
the results demonstrates that replacing the WSe2 layer
with MoSe2 results in an enhancement of the thermal
conductance of the p- or n-type doped structure [see Fig.
6(c)]. More importantly, it is shown in Fig. 6(d) that
the thermal conductance in the absence of the SOC term
in the F region (magnetized gapped graphene/ super-
conducting WSe2 structure) as well as the F/S struc-
ture without SOC term (gapped graphene-based struc-

ture) are signiﬁcantly larger than that of the WSe2-based
structure [see Fig. 6(d)]. Meanwhile, the inset of Fig.
6(d) presents less enhancement of the thermal conduc-
tance in the corresponding structures based on MoSe2.

Ultimately, we present the chemical potential depen-
dence of the thermal conductance of WSe2-based F/S
structures with various types of doping for the F and S
regions in Fig. 7, when |µS| = 1 eV. In the case of the
n-doped F/S structure, it is perceived that the thermal
conductance experiences a cusplike behavior, increases
with µF for µF < µS and after reaching a maximum at
µF = µS it decreases for µF > µS [ see Fig. 7(a)]. Twist-
ing the CrI3 with respect to the WSe2 layer suppresses
the thermal conductance for a broader range of µF . In-
creasing the chemical potential of the F region makes the
thermal conductance decrease relative to the untwisted
one for µF < µS. The twist-angle induced changes in
the magnitude of the thermal conductance decrease with
increasing µF and tend to zero at low T /TC ratio, when
µF → µS [see the inset of Fig. 7(a)]. Nevertheless, in-
creasing the T /TC ratio can lead to an enhancement of
the thermal conductance in the presence of the twisting

it is noted from the inset of Fig. 7(b) that the gate elec-
tric ﬁeld-induced enhancement of the proximity exchange
coupling results in a slight reduction of the thermal con-
ductance. Comparing the results of thermal conductance
for various types of doping in F/S structures conﬁrms
that the high thermal conductance belongs to p-doped
structure and the F/S structure with the n-type doping
has low thermal conductance [see Fig. 7(d)].

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have studied the electrical and ther-
mal transport properties of a TMDC/CrI3 heterostruc-
ture (as ferromagnetic region) connected to a TMDC su-
perconducting layer within the scattering formalism. It is
found that the presence of a spin-orbit interaction leads
to a spin valley polarized AR process, which can be ef-
fectively modulated by tuning the charge doping, twist-
ing the CrI3 monolayer relative to the TMDC layer and
applying a gate electric ﬁeld. The perfect spin valley po-
larized AR is visible for subgap biases eVbias < ∆S when
the chemical potential of the ferromagnetic domain µF
in a p- or n-doped structure is the same as that of the
superconducting region µS and over a wide range of µF
(|µF | ≤ |µS|) when eVbias = ∆S. Also, it can be achieved
for almost all values of µF in the corresponding structure
with diﬀerent types of charge doping for F and S regions
by increasing the chemical potential of the S region, if
eVbias = ∆S.

Importantly, the twist angle between the CrI3 and the
TMDC (with WSe2 and MoSe2 as TMDC) leads to the
suppression or reduction of the spin valley polarized An-
dreev conductance and the enhancement of the nonspin
valley-polarized Andreev conductance, depending on the
chemical potential µF . Notably, changes in the magni-
tude of the Andreev conductance by twisting are reduced
to an increase in the subgap bias and might vanish at
eVbias = ∆S in the WSe2-based structure. However,
it can be enhanced by increasing the bias for the de-
ﬁned chemical potential of the ferromagnetic region in
the MoSe2-based structure. We further analyzed the in-
ﬂuence of twisting on thermal conductance and showed
that for |µF | < |µS| in the proposed structure with p-
type doping, an increase in thermal conductance can oc-
cur while it is reduced in the n-doped structure. Fur-
thermore, increasing the proximity exchange by apply-
ing a positive gate electric ﬁeld to the TMDC/CrI3 het-
erostructure slightly decreases the thermal conductance
of the p-type doping as well as the probability of an AR
process and accordingly the Andreev conductance and
suppresses them for small values of µF .

Furthermore, we have shown that Andreev and ther-

11

mal conductance can be signiﬁcantly altered by tuning
the type of charge doping in ferromagnetic and super-
conducting regions. The proposed structure shows high
Andreev and thermal conductance in the case of p-type
doping. We have further found that the low charge con-
ductance of the p-doped ferromagnetic/n-doped super-
conducting junction can be increased remarkably by in-
creasing the chemical potential of the superconducting
region. Furthermore, our results show that replacing
WSe2 with MoSe2 tends to increase the Andreev con-
ductance as well as enhancing thermal conductance in
p-doped F/S structures and decreasing thermal conduc-
tance in n-type doped structures. In addition, changing
the TMDC material leads to diﬀerent dependencies of the
chemical potential µF of the thermal conductance. Fur-
thermore, switching oﬀ the spin-orbit interaction in the
structure by using graphene with voids in one or both
of the ferromagnetic and superconducting regions causes
signiﬁcant changes in the electrical and thermal conduc-
tance of the proposed structure; it leads to a signiﬁcant
damping of the Andreev conductance, as well as a large
increase in thermal conductance. Our theoretical ﬁnding
can be explored through actual experiments.

Appendix A: The eﬀects of spin-orbit interaction,
twisting and the applied transverse-electric ﬁeld on
the Andreev conductance of a MoSe2-based F/S
structure

We investigate the behavior of the Andreev conduc-
tance of a p-doped MoSe2-based F/S structure in Fig. 8.
In comparison with the WSe2-based structure, a slight
reduction of the Andreev conductance in the absence of
the SOC term in the F region is obvious from Fig. 8(a).
A cusplike behavior is present away from the Andreev
peak, at a minor value of the chemical potential inside
the F region, because of the weaker spin-orbit interaction
in MoSe2 [see Fig. 8(b)]. Importantly, an ampliﬁcation
of the Andreev conductance by twisting increases with
the subgap bias for the chemical potential µF = −0.745
eV, being at the cusp position, while it decreases with
eVbias/∆S for WSe2-based structure [see Fig. 8(d)]. In
addition, it can be perceived from Fig. 8(c) that the
p-doped F/S junction has higher spin valley polarized
Andreev conductance in comparison with the n-type one
at zero bias and perfect electron-hole conversion occurs
for a wide range of µF , when eVbias/∆S = 1.

conductance of the p-type doped structure increases with
enhancing |µF | for |µF | ≤ 0.8 |µS| and decreases for
|µF | > 0.8 |µS|. Besides, the thermal conductance can

an increasing behavior with the temperature. Similar to
the WSe2-based structures, the thermal conductance in-
creases with enhancing the magnitude of the chemical
potential inside the F region of n-doped F/S (p-doped
F/n-doped S) structure for µF ≤ µS (|µF | ≤ 0.8 µS)
and decreases for µF > µS (|µF | > 0.8 µS). However,
in contrast with the WSe2-based structure, the thermal

be increased by enhancing the chemical potential of the
S region [see the inset of Fig. 9(a)]. We further demon-
strate the ampliﬁcation of the thermal conductance in
F/S structures with a p-doped F region in comparison
with that of the n-type doping [see Fig. 9(d)].

Interestingly, as it is presented in Fig. 10, the peak
structures of the thermal conductance in terms of |µF | in
MoSe2-based F/S structures with various types of charge
doping for F and S regions are diﬀerent from those of
the corresponding WSe2-based structures. Also, the high
thermal conductance of p-doped structure in comparison
with that of the n-doped structure is obvious from Fig.
10(a). Moreover, it can be seen from Fig. 10(b) that
twisting tends to the ampliﬁcation of the thermal con-
ductance in a wide range of µF . However, we have found
(not shown) that the enhancement of the proximity ex-
change by the positive gate electric ﬁeld leads to the small
reduction of the thermal conductance around the peak.
