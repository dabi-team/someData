On Strengthening of the Solar f-mode Prior to Active
Region Emergence Using the Fourier-Hankel Analysis

Abstract Recent results of Singh et al. (2016) show that the emergence of an active
region (AR) can be seen in a strengthening of the f-mode power up to two days prior
of the region’s formation. In the original work, ring diagram analysis was used to es-
timate the power evolution. In this study, we make use of the Fourier-Hankel method,
essentially testing the aforementioned results with an independent method. The data is
acquired from SDO/HMI, studying the ARs 11158, 11072, 11105, 11130, 11242 and
11768. Investigating the total power as a function of time, we ﬁnd a similar behavior to
the original work, which is an enhancement of f-mode power about one to three days
prior to AR emergence. Analysis of the absorption coefﬁcient α, yielded by a Fourier-
Hankel analysis, shows neither absorption (α > 0) nor emission (α < 0) of power
during the enhancement. Finding no changes of the absorption coefﬁcient (i.e. α = 0)
is an important result, as it narrows down the possible physical interpretation of the
original f-mode power enhancement, showing that no directional dependence (in the
sense of inward and outward moving waves) is present.

1. Introduction

Finding ways to reliably predict the emergence of active regions is an important ap-
plication of solar physics, as it allows for the ability to forecast some aspects of space
weather. Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including ﬂares,
solar energetic particles, and radio bursts This is due to the fact that active regions act

as hosts to almost all solar eruptive phenomena, such as ﬂares, radio bursts and coronal
mass ejections (Webb & Howard, 2012; Temmer, 2021). In the context of helioseis-
mology, it has been shown in the past that active regions strongly inﬂuence many solar
properties measure with helioseismic methods (Rajaguru, 2001; Braun & Birch, 2006;
Schunker et al., 2013; Rijs et al., 2015), even before the appearance of a strong magnetic
ﬁeld in surface magnetograms (Hartlep, 2009). Emerging active regions have been
investigated in the past by means of time-distance helioseismology (Ilonidis, 2011),
down to a depth of 75 Mm. In terms of actual precursor signals, a retrograde ﬂow
with an amplitude of 100 m/s roughly 2 hours prior to emergence has been observed
(Schunker et al., 2016), while subsurface ﬂows remain weak (on the order of 1 m/s, not
larger than 15 m/s) and obfuscated (Hanasoge, 2008; Birch et al., 2013). Other fruit-
ful studies involving the fundamental mode (f-mode) yielded many results regarding
shallow (usually only a few Mm) subsurface magnetic ﬁelds (Hindman et al., 2004).
The theoretical work of Singh et al. (2014, 2020) shows that f-mode frequencies, as
well as its amplitude, are sensitive to subsurface magnetic ﬁelds. As many details about
the build up and the emergence of active regions, as well as their subsurface ﬂows and
structure remain uncertain (Gizon et al., 2009; Moradi et al., 2010), studying f-mode
variability in the presence of active regions is a promising method to learn about the
solar dynamo (Charbonneau, 2020) and subsurface solar magnetism more speciﬁcally
(Hanasoge, 2008; Felipe et al., 2012).

This study builds on the observations of Singh et al. (2016), who reported a sys-
tematic strengthening of f-mode power, prior to the emergence of an active region.
We employ a Fourier-Hankel analysis to ﬁrst estimate the power evolution aiming to
test the aforementioned observations with an independent method, and secondly, to
calculate the absorption coefﬁcient α, to potentially link these results to earlier studies.
A Fourier-Hankel analysis was ﬁrst applied in the context of helioseismology by Braun
et al. (1987), in order to investigate the power absorption by sunspots. The Fourier-
Hankel method was further used and reﬁned in the context of local helioseismology
(Couvidat, 2013; Felipe et al., 2014). It has been useful speciﬁcally in investigations of
power evolution in solar surface magnetism (Fan et al., 1995; Lindsey & Braun, 1999).
Our work relies on Dopplergrams recorded by HMI (Schou et al., 2012) and the data
processing reported in the original work of Singh et al. (2016). We test the hypothesis
that there is an initial enhancement of f-mode power 1 to 3 days prior to the emergence
of an active region, followed by the well established power reduction due to the sunspot
being present. Simultaneous to the reduction of power, an increase in absorption (α >
0) will follow. Therefore, calculating α during the initial power enhancement can either
result in emission (decrease of the absorption coefﬁcient, α < 0), which will let us
make a connection to the sunspot-power behavior, or a result of zero absorption (α = 0)
suggesting another, potentially unknown, mechanism to be present.

At ﬁrst we will go over data acquisition and treatment in Section 2, discussing
similarities and differences compared to the original work. Second, details regarding
the Fourier-Hankel method applied here will be discussed in Section 3. Our results will
be presented in Section 4, while discussion and conclusions are shown in Section 5.

2. Data Acquisition and Treatment

The data preparation is designed to be as similar as possible to that described in Singh
et al. (2016), albeit a different helioseismic method was used. As a ﬁrst step for the
analysis, we track AR 11158 starting prior to its emergence on 2011.02.14 with mtrack
(Bogart, 2007), using the Snodgrass-rate as tracking rate (Snodgrass & Ulrich, 1990).
Furthermore, for every frame the line-of-sight component of both observer velocity and
solar rotation are removed. The contributions of granulation to the velocity signal are
reduced by applying a running difference, yielding a from now on labeled corrected
velocity signal v. In addition to the magnetically active region, a quiet-Sun control
region with the same tracking rate and initial position but on the opposite hemisphere
is tracked. Thus, for each active region that is tracked with starting point (x, y) (rep-
resenting longitude, latitude), the corresponding quiet-Sun starting point is given by
(x, −y). Let us call this quiet control region as QS 11158, which corresponds to the
AR 11158. The B0-angle at that time is −6.72◦, which affects the measured surface
velocity to some degree, although it does so in a uniform manner concerning northern
and southern hemisphere. All other regions (ARs 11072: tAR = 2010.05.23, 11105:
tAR = 2010.08.03, 11130: tAR = 2010.11.29, 11242: tAR = 2011.06.29 and 11768:
tAR = 2013.06.14) are tracked, similarly to Singh et al. (2016). We take the same
deﬁnition of AR emergence time tAR as in the original work. Each active region is
required to be isolated, meaning no signiﬁcantly strong magnetic ﬁeld appears in its
vicinity during the full tracking period. Furthermore, all regions should emerge close to
the central meridian, such that the region can be observed up to three days, before and
after. Using data from cycle 24 only, these requirements lead to a naturally small sample
size (a total of six in this case). Increasing the sample can be achieved by considering
non-isolated ARs. In this work however, we will restrict ourselves to isolated regions,
preferring ’best case’ scenarios over a larger amount of data. A snapshot of AR 11158
in a helioprojective coordinate frame is shown in Figure 1, its corresponding quiet-Sun
control region (QS 11158) is shown in Figure 2. Note that we opted to show Mag-
netograms here for visualization purposes, since the extent of the magnetically active
region is easier to see. Otherwise Dopplergrams are used throughout the analysis.

Tracking yields ﬁve days of 8 hour long 1024 pixel×1024 pixel-data cubes at a
cadence of 45s and a map scale of 0.365 Mm (= 0.03◦). Each of these 8 hour cubes rep-
resents one data point of f-modal power, as we will see in the further analysis. All data
cubes contain Postel-projected (see right panels of Figure 1 & 2) Dopplergrams in a he-
liographic longitude-latitude grid, i.e. v(x, y, t). After performing a Fourier-transform,
we select data at kx = 0, i.e. V (kx = 0, ky, ν). Here, V is the Fourier-transform of
v, kx represents the longitudinal component of the wavenumber k, while ky represents
the latitudinal component and ﬁnally ν is the frequency. Afterwards, all data within a
certain annulus are considered, as shown in Figure 1. The kx = 0 selection is made to
be in accordance with Singh et al. (2016). Its beneﬁts are ﬁrst and foremost to reduce
the total amount of data and can be understood as a customary procedure, equivalent to
a longitudinal average, yielding the thus obtained mean power variation in our analysis.

remarked, this region is tracked simultaneously to AR 11158, but on the opposite hemisphere. An apparent
offset from the equator (y = 0) can be seen, which is due to the non zero B0-angle.

3. Fourier-Hankel decomposition

The decomposition method used here is described in detail in Braun et al. (1987) &
Gizon & Birch (2005). After Fourier transforming the velocity amplitudes v(x, y, t)
of all Dopplergrams within a given annulus (Figure 1 & 2), we select kx = 0 as
mentioned and interpolate the resulting signal onto a radial grid. This allows us to
further truncate the data, leaving only signals within an annulus, covering the direct
vicinity of the (not yet emerged) active region. The annulus (deﬁned by two circles with
radii rinner, router) has the dimension rinner, router = (15 pixel, 200 pixel) = (5.48, 73.07)
Mm, yielding a grid-spacing of ∆(cid:96) = 59.50. The choice of this small annulus was made
since we will deal with very small scale oscillations in the analysis ((cid:96) ∈ [1200, 2000])

the Fourier-Hankel method, the magnetic region is usually dropped to exclude direct
effects of the sunspot to the velocity signal (Braun et al., 1987; Fan et al., 1995). Such
direct effects include degrading of the Doppler signal by distorting the atomic line and
suppressing oscillations, but also contributions to the line-of-sight velocity by the moat-
ﬂow or other surface ﬂows. Here we don’t have to worry about direct effects, since we
observe the velocity signal prior to the emergence of the active region. In turn, this
means that any analysis after the emergence is using velocity signals corrupted by the
sunspot. The above mentioned interval of (cid:96) is expected to show f-mode strengthening
prior to the emergence of an active region (Singh et al., 2016), and has been shown
to exhibit power enhancement due to a localized subsurface magnetic concentration in
simulations Singh et al. (2020). For truncating, a spatial Hann-window λN (Blackman
& Tuckey, 1958) was applied to the data V (r, t) with

λN (n) = 0.5 − 0.5 cos

,

(1)

where N is the sample size (N = rinner − router = 185 for the spatial window
and N = 640 for the temporal window) and where 0 ≤ n < N − 1. The Hankel
decomposition yields the complex time series a(cid:96)(t) and b(cid:96)(t) of in- and outgoing waves
within the annulus, by making use of the orthogonality of Hankel functions:

and ∆r = rinner − router,

whereby H (2)(Lr) is the Hankel function of second kind. For calculating b(cid:96)(ν)
Equation 2 can be used with the Hankel function of ﬁrst kind H (1)(Lr). From the
complex amplitudes a(cid:96)(t), b(cid:96)(t) we calculate the periodograms P in

(cid:96) (ν) and P out

(cid:96) (ν)

P(cid:96)(ν) = WS (f(cid:96)(t)) ,

(3)

where WS(f ) denotes calculation of the power-spectrum via Welch’s method (Welch,
1967), using again a Hann-window (Eq. 1) and f(cid:96)(t) is a complex time series repre-
senting either a(cid:96)(t) or b(cid:96)(t). As is usual for Welch’s method, the time-series is further
divided into S equally long segments. A window function is applied to each segment,
designed in such a way that it overlaps into half of the following segment. This overlap
is preferred to avoid bias introduced due to the window function almost eliminating
velocity signal close to the edge of individual segments. This techniques results in S
individual power spectra, which are then averaged to reduce noise. Here we set S = 3,
as this appears to be the best trade-off between sufﬁcient frequency resolution and
noise reduction in the resulting spectrum. The spectra P in
(cid:96) (ν) are obtained for
f(cid:96)(t) = a(cid:96)(t), b(cid:96)(t) respectively. Subsequently, we calculate the absorption coefﬁcient
(Braun et al., 1987):

Figure 3. Power spectrum P tot (left) and absorption coefﬁcient α (right) as a function of harmonic degree
(cid:96) and temporal frequency ν for a duration of 8 hours. As can be seen, the f-mode ridge is well resolved,
granulation noise is almost eliminated (due to the running difference) and other background contributions are
minimal. In the absorption map, red means power absorption, while blue means power emission. This section
of the full time series corresponds to a time after the active region emerged, which explains why absorption
along ridges can be seen.

Both P tot

(cid:96) (ν) and α(cid:96)(ν) are shown in Figure 3. In the left panel we then see the
usual (cid:96)-ν-diagram with multiple ridges. As expected, we see barely any low frequency
granulation noise, due to the running difference applied initially. The seemingly low
resolution stems from the rather broad grid spacing of ∆(cid:96) = 59.50 and the temporal
duration of just 8 hours (the total duration is 5 days which is divided into 8 segments
as mentioned). Furthermore, the f-mode "fans out" towards high (cid:96) (Singh et al., 2014),
meaning the line-width increases. This has to be accounted for in the (cid:96) ∈ [1200, 2000]
range, by employing an adequate ﬁt in the following analysis. Comparing the total
power to the absorption spectrum (right panel), we also see ridge-like structures. This
is due to the active region’s emergence towards the end of the observation, which will
lead to absorption of power (Braun et al., 1987; Cally & Bogdan, 1997). Another feature
is a wide area of weak emission at very low frequencies ν < 2 mHz below the f-mode
frequencies and rather large (cid:96) , seemingly within the range of solar granulation (see for
example Couvidat 2013; Waidele et al. 2021) and propagating gravity waves. In this
particular frequency range, the absorption coefﬁcient α is rather unreliable, since not a
lot of power is present in the ﬁrst place. Either way, the region is well separated from in
the frequency domain from the f-mode ridge, ensuring that such granulation noise does
not affect further analysis.

Error estimates are calculated as described in Priestley (1981). The variance of a
periodogram P is given as var(P ) = 4P 2 and does not depend on the sample size N

The apodization process also makes the χ2-distributed periodogram converge to-
wards a Gaussian distribution (enabling the estimation of an actual errorbar). Since we
use Hann windows, the variance reduces to var(P ) = P 2 · 3/4, with the corresponding
error σP /P = 0.866. This is further reduced by averaging over S = 3 segments (see
Equation 3). Furthermore, performing weighted sums over (cid:96) and ν as will be shown in
the next Section ﬁnally yields σP /P = 0.133, or for the absorption α

σα/β = 0.188,
β = P out/P in .

(7)

(8)

This process results in a reliable estimation of errorbars as the spectra P follow

approximately Gaussian distributions.

4. Results

(cid:96) (ν) and P out

To calculate the absorption coefﬁcient α along the f-mode more precisely, we ﬁrst have
to ﬁnd solid estimates for P in
(cid:96) (ν). For this purpose, we employ a procedure
equivalent to that presented in Singh et al. (2016). Thus, we ﬁt the entire spectrum to
ﬁnd the power distribution of the f-mode, using a combination of Lorentz-curves (to
describe oscillatory processes within the spectrum) and Gaussian-curves plus constant
(to describe background power). Most of the power P(cid:96)(ν) within (cid:96) ∈ [1200, 2000] is
made up of contributions from the f-mode ridge, the p1-ridge and background, such that
the most simple model M (ν) is given by two Lorentz-curves Lf(ν) + Lp, 1(ν) plus a
single Gaussian G(ν) plus a constant background c:

M (ν) = Lf(ν) + Lp, 1(ν) + G(ν) + c

(9)

Although there are notable contributions from higher order p-modes, they barely con-
tribute to the f-mode power distribution itself, such that, for the sake of ﬁt robustness,
we do not consider higher orders for our ﬁt function. An example of a ﬁt result for a
single value of (cid:96) (here (cid:96) = 1556, exemplary for P in(ν)) is shown in Figure 4. In Figure
5 we show a comparison of the available power data (also exemplary for P in(ν)) with
the ﬁt results for all spectra (cid:96) ∈ [1200, 2000].

By making use of the true f-mode spectrum Lf(ν) we can estimate the energy Ef

within the f-mode as follows:

Ef (ν) ∝

kP tot(ν),

dots represent the data. The red line shows the ﬁt result, using M (ν) as model function (Eq. 9), whereas the
blue line only shows the according result for Lf(ν) + c, i.e. the true f-mode power spectrum plus a static
background c.

therefore representing essentially a weighted sum over k = (cid:96)/(2πR(cid:12)). Still, Ef (ν) is
explicitly given as a function of time Ef (ν) = Ef (ν, (cid:104)t(cid:105)), since we divided the full 6
day time series into (cid:104)t(cid:105) = 8 hour segments. Thus, for a smoother result, we sum over
the entire spectrum ν:

Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) =

(cid:88)

ν

Ef (ν, (cid:104)t(cid:105))

(11)

It is important that we recognize that Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) is not only an explicit function of time,
but also an implicit function of longitude, as the tracked region wanders across the solar
disk as time passes. This fact will lead to a systematic weakening of oscillatory power
when Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) is measured close to the limb. Solar oscillations are seen in the vertical
velocity component, while contributions to horizontal velocities generally stem from
granulation. Finally, this causes Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) to show strong variations along the longitude,

with

ζ(cos α) = cos α (q + (1 − q) cos α) ,

(12)

cos α = cos θ cos φ,

and q = 0.5 ,

in which θ and φ represent the latitude and longitude of the tracked region. Now we can
correct Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) using

(cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) = Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105))/ζ .

(13)

Although, the main focus of this work is to calculate power absorption as a function
of time α((cid:104)t(cid:105)), estimating the energy (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) alongside α((cid:104)t(cid:105)) is important to allow for
direct comparison between the two and shed additional light to the ﬁndings of Singh et
al. (2016). For the correct estimation of α((cid:104)t(cid:105)), we employ a weighted sum over k and
a sum over ν for both spectra P in
(cid:96) (ν). A further correction using ζ is not
required, since longitudinal dependencies are canceled out when calculating the ratio
P out/P in as in Equation 4. Note that we only consider a proportional component of
Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) in Equation 10 which means that both energy and power essentially mean the
same thing in the context of this work.

(cid:96) (ν) and P out

The f-mode energy (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) and the absorption coefﬁcient α((cid:104)t(cid:105)) are both shown for

AR 11158 in 6.

Figure 6. Shown are f-mode energy (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) (left) and the absorption coefﬁcient α (right) for all time
segments (cid:104)t(cid:105) minus the emergence time of the active region tAR (namely t − tAR). The blue curve represents
data taken from the active region sample, the orange (dashed) curved shows the corresponding quiet-Sun
data. Curves are 3-point box-car smoothed, to reveal trends better. The top axis (for both panels) shows the
Stonyhurst longitude of the tracked regions.

Interpreting the f-mode energy (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) can be done by comparing both measure-
ments for the AR and the corresponding QS region. Regarding the quiet-Sun energy,
we can generally expect a constant, smooth distribution, providing an expectation for
the ’background’-energy of the entire near side of the Sun at that time. Therefore,
any deviations from of the AR distribution from its expected (QS-) distribution indi-
cates additional physics. Following the conclusion of Singh et al. (2016), we expect

t − tAR = 0). What we observe here, is a signiﬁcant power excess that can be seen
before t − tAR < −24 hours.For the following 4 time segments, the energy remains at
nominal values before experiencing a stark reduction It is indeed expected that the total
power in the active region is suppressed, due to the power absorption of the emerging
active region itself.

Looking at the absorption coefﬁcient α (right panel) for quiet-Sun (orange), we
expect α ≈ 0 at all times, since no (relevant) physical process is actively absorbing or
emitting power. As we observe, except for minor deviations, this is indeed the case. In
principle, even weak magnetic features corresponding to for example short lived pores
can cause momentary increases of α, even for quiet-Sun regions. Concerning negative
values, the only few (larger scale) mechanisms known to cause α < 0 are acoustic
glories (refs) and potentially convective motions (refs).

For the active region (blue), a steady increase in absorption is observed during
emergence (and arguably even before that) which is thereby in phase with the drop in
(cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)). Most notably, no power emission is detected during the strong power excess
at −72 h < t − tAR < −40 h. This is odd at ﬁrst sight, although not necessarily
unsurprising: Looking at both P in and P out individually, see Figure 7, we ﬁnd that
P out is consistently weaker than P in. For the quiet-Sun region we again, expect a
smooth, constant distribution with P in = P out for all times which is observed except
for minor perturbations. In order to explain the f-mode strengthening in the absence
of any power emission (α < 0), P in and P out have to increase simultaneously during
the strengthening phase of (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)). This is thus also observed as an enhancement of
the total power (the energy) at that time. Interestingly, this type of enhancement is
fundamentally different from the power absorption by active regions, in which only one
of the power components (P out in this case) is affected, while P in remains unchanged.
This behavior calls for a speciﬁc investigation with the help of theoretical work (i.e.
simulations), to learn the exact evolution of P in and P out during the emergence of an
active region.

interchangeable with power. The left panel shows results for AR 11158, while the right panel shows results

strengthening signal, given the fact that estimations of power spectra tend to be erratic in
nature. For this reason, we investigate both the range of errorbars and the data variance

5. Discussion and Conclusions

We found that the f-mode energy (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) for AR 11158 (see Fig. 6) shows a behavior
that is qualitatively in line with that reported in Singh et al. (2016), which is a signiﬁcant
enhancement during −72h < t − tAR < −40h prior to AR emergence. The increase
in (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)) is less pronounced for other ARs, especially for AR 11105 (Fig. 11) and
AR 11242 (Fig. 12) although still detectable. Furthermore, no such enhancement can
be found in the quiet-Sun control regions. Investigations, regarding correlations of this
enhancement to the evolution of the surface magnetic ﬂux were carried out in Singh
et al. (2016) and yielded inconclusive results. The current method of decomposing
the observed Dopplergram is mostly analogous to that used in Singh et al. (2016),
but still differs in a few aspects. For one, using the Fourier-Hankel-decomposition
to estimate spatial (total) power spectra is different from the standard spatial Fourier
decomposition (into sinusoidal functions) used in ring diagram analysis. When calcu-
lating P tot = P in + P out, we calculate more exactly W(a) + W(b) (see Eq. 3), which
represents the sum of Bessel functions of ﬁrst and second kind (Braun et al., 1988).
This is mathematically different than the estimation P tot = W(v) (v is the velocity
signal). However, this difference in power estimation is expected to affect mostly the
power magnitude, but not the qualitative distribution. Additionally, the area (annulus,
see Fig. 1) we used is smaller, in order to retain some sensitivity of α to oscillations
with high harmonic degree (cid:96). Overall, the mentioned differences in data processing
methods are expected to have a minor inﬂuence on the results, as the mathematical
way of decomposing the velocity signal is similar, but can still explain the subtlety
of f-mode power enhancement, that we ﬁnd here. Initially we mentioned that P may
only be approximately Gaussian distributed, such that it is unclear if σP is adequately
underestimated. Generally, there are several sources of uncertainty that may contribute
to σP but which are hardly quantiﬁable. Examples include instrument-conditioned un-
certainties and aforementioned center-to-limb effects. To test the accuracy of σP , we
estimate the variance of our data P tot (exemplary for a quiet-Sun region), by using an
empirical model ζ (see Eq. 12) for its expectation value. For QS 11158, we ﬁnd values
between of approximately 0.01 for (cid:112)var(P ), while for the estimated error σP , values
range between 0.02 – 0.06 (see Fig. 8). An analysis for other QS regions yielded similar

in the signiﬁcance of the strengthening of (cid:102)Ef ((cid:104)t(cid:105)). Another factor to consider is the
aforementioned B0-angle, which is non-zero in the ARs we investigated. If we assume
that P tot for both AR and QS follow the same trend, approximated by ζ, correcting the
distribution mostly eliminates this effect, except for a minor distortion in magnitude,
which we expect to be much smaller than σP however.

Regarding power absorption, it is in general less troublesome to calculate the ab-
sorption coefﬁcient α than the total power P tot or energy E, since any result of Pout/Pin
automatically corrects most effects of longitudinal (or other time and location depen-
dent) variation, projection effects (center-to-limb) and granulation noise. In our results
(see, Figure 6), it is surprising that no emission (i. e. α < 0) accompanying the f-mode
power strengthening is detected. On the contrary, after the emergence of the AR, its
effects on the local velocity ﬁeld can be seen in total power and α simultaneously. From
Figures 9 - 12 we can conﬁrm this behavior. In conclusion, the underlying mechanism
of f-mode strengthening as observed in Singh et al. (2016) has thus to be different from
the power absorption by sunspots as reported in Braun et al. (1987) and explained in
Spruit & Bogdan (1992); Cally & Bogdan (1993); Cally et al. (2003). We thus ﬁnd with
conﬁdence that f-mode strengthening prior to AR emergence is a non-directional (at
least in the sense of inward and outward propagation) phenomenon. An idea for a future
analysis could include splitting the initial annulus into sectors, to split the power within
the annulus into additional directional components (i.e. West-East, North-South).

In conclusion, analysis of total power in the ARs 11158, 11072, 11105, 11130,
and 11242 shows similar behavior to that reported in Singh et al. (2016). This can
be summarized as follows: Enhancement of f-mode power at high (cid:96) one to three days
prior to AR emergence, followed by depression of f-mode power that sets in just after
emergence of the AR, as expected.

Finding the underlying physics of these observations presented and restated here
has proven to be difﬁcult, although Singh et al. (2020) found from simulations that
the magnetic ﬁelds subsurface conﬁguration plays a major role. Our work serves as
conﬁrmation of the ﬁndings in Singh et al. (2016), additionally yielding original results
and conclusions. In combination with the earlier work of Singh et al. (2016), the current
results further suggest that high spatial frequency f-mode strengthening needs to be
considered as a viable precursor signal of forming ARs. Our results prove that the
Fourier-Hankel method not only accompanies the ring diagram analysis in terms of
prediction capabilities, but it also provides new insight and information, especially due
to the reliability and robustness of the absorption coefﬁcient α to any systematic effect.
