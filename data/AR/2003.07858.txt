CLUSTER CATEGORIES OF FORMAL DG ALGEBRAS AND
SINGULARITY CATEGORIES

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

Abstract. Given a negatively graded Calabi-Yau algebra, we regard it as a DG algebra with vanishing
diﬀerentials and study its cluster category. We show that this DG algebra is sign-twisted Calabi-Yau, and
realize its cluster category as a triangulated hull of an orbit category of a derived category, and as the
singularity category of a ﬁnite dimensional Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra. Along the way, we give two results
which stand on their own. First, we show that the derived category of coherent sheaves over a Calabi-
Yau algebra has a natural cluster tilting subcategory whose dimension is determined by the Calabi-Yau
dimension and the a-invariant of the algebra. Secondly, we prove that two DG orbit categories obtained
from a DG endofunctor and its homotopy inverse are quasi-equivalent. As an application, we show that the
higher cluster category of a higher representation inﬁnite algebra is triangle equivalent to the singularity
category of an Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra which is explicitly described. Also, we demonstrate that our
results generalize the context of Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh on the derived orbit category involving a
square root of the AR translation.

1. Introduction

Cluster tilting theory emerged in the beginning of this century in the contexts of categoriﬁcation of cluster
algebras [BMRRT] and higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory [I1], which has lead to fruitful connec-
tions between various areas of mathematics. A central role is played by the concept of cluster tilting objects
in Calabi-Yau (CY) triangulated categories, which gives a categoriﬁcation of Fomin–Zeleinsky’s cluster alge-
bra [FZ]; see for example [Ke5] for an introduction. A general construction of such triangulated categories is

given as Amiot’s generalized cluster categories [Am], which is based on the formalism of diﬀerential graded
(DG) algebras [Ke3]. Throughout we ﬁx a ﬁeld k. Recall that a DG k-algebra Λ is bimodule (n + 1)-CY [Gi]
if it is homologically smooth and there is an isomorphism

RHomΛe (Λ, Λe)[n + 1] ≃ Λ

in D(Λe), where Λe is the enveloping algebra Λop ⊗k Λ. Then the cluster category C(Λ) of Λ is the Verdier
quotient of the perfect derived category per Λ by the thick subcategory Db(Λ) consisting of DG modules of
ﬁnite dimensional total cohomology. The fundamental result due to Amiot and its generalization by Guo
[Am, Gu] states that if Λ is a bimodule (n + 1)-CY DG algebra, then C(Λ) is an n-CY triangulated category
and Λ ∈ C(Λ) is an n-cluster tilting object.

The aim of this paper is to give some descriptions of this cluster category for a certain class of DG algebras,
namely formal DG algebras. Recall that a DG algebra is formal if it is isomorphic to its cohomology in the
homotopy category of DG algebras. We therefore start our discussion with a graded (non-DG) algebra R
and view it as a DG algebra Rdg with trivial diﬀerentials.

1.1. Cluster categories and orbit categories. Our ﬁrst observation is that we can obtain a class of
CY DG algebras from certain graded (non-DG) algebras. Recall the distinct notion of CY algebra for
graded non-DG algebras; a graded algebra R over a ﬁeld k is bimodule (d + 1)-CY of a-invariant a if it is
homologically smooth and there is an isomorphism

RHomRe (R, Re)(a)[d + 1] ≃ R

Z

Re) of graded bimodules (this should not be confused with the derived
in the derived category D(Mod
category D((Rdg)e) of the DG algebra (Rdg)e). Here (1) is the degree shift functor on the graded modules,
while [1] is the suspension in the derived category. Such algebras arise naturally and are studied extensively
in representation theory and commutative or non-commutative algebraic geometry [AS, YZ, Boc1, KS, IR,
BS, BSW, MM, AIR, V, RR].

It is well-known that among CY algebras, those of a-invariant 1 are fundamental in the sense that it is
the higher preprojective algebra [IO] of its degree 0 part [Ke6, MM, HIO, AIR]. Although our results are
already non-trivial for a = 1, we study CY algebras of arbitrary a-invariant, which exhibits some additional
symmetries.

Let R be a CY algebra. We view it as a DG algebra with vanishing diﬀerentials, which we denote by Rdg,
and study its properties. Note that the gradings on R and on Rdg are of diﬀerent nature; the ﬁrst one is
‘algebraic’ while the second one is ‘cohomological’ (see [Y, Section 3.1, 15.1]). Such homological properties
of DG algebras have been investigated for example in [HM, MGYC]. The following observation shows a
relationship between the CY properties of R and Rdg. In particular, we obtain from a graded CY algebra
a DG algebra which is always very close to being CY, and often in fact CY. We refer to Theorem 5.2 for a
precise statement. Here we do not need any additional assumptions on R such as (R0) etc below.

Proposition 1.1 (Theorem 5.2). Let R be a graded bimodule (d + 1)-CY algebra of a-invariant a. Then
Rdg is sign twisted bimodule (d + a + 1)-CY.

For a DG algebra Λ satisfying per Λ ⊃ Db(Λ), we set

C(Λ) := per Λ/Db(Λ)

and call it, by abuse of language, the cluster category of Λ.
If Λ is a CY DG algebra (e.g. the derived
preprojective algebra [Ke6] of a ﬁnite dimensional algebra, and the Ginzburg DG algebra [Gi] associated
to a quiver with potential) then C(Λ) is the usual cluster category introduced in [Am]. Although our DG
algebra Rdg is not CY in general, it is close enough to CY so that we can deﬁne the cluster category C(Rdg),
which gives rise to a cluster tilting object. To understand this category we ﬁrst study the categories arising
from the graded algebra R, and then compare with those arising from Rdg.

We now assume the following on the CY algebra R.

(R0) R is negatively graded.
(R1) Each Ri is ﬁnite dimensional.

We note that the condition (R0) can be replaced by positive grading up to Theorem 1.2 below, but negative
grading will be essential in the later discussion.

Let per R be the perfect derived category of R, that is, the thick subcategory of D(Mod

R) generated
R) be the bounded derived category of

Z
by the ﬁnitely generated graded projective modules. Also let Db(ﬂ
graded R-modules of ﬁnite length. We set

Z

R).

Z
When R is Noetherian (or more generally graded coherent), we have perZR = Db(mod
R), the bounded
derived category of ﬁnitely presented graded R-modules. Then the Verdier quotient qperZR is nothing but
Z
the derived category of the Serre quotient qgr R = mod
R, which is regarded as the category of coherent
sheaves over the non-commutative projective scheme [AZ] and plays an essential role in non-commutative
algebraic geometry. Our category qperZR is thus a generalization of the derived category Db(qgr R).

Our ﬁrst main result is the existence of a natural cluster tilting subcategory in qperZR, which is of
independent interest. More importantly, we prove that the construction of qperZR as the Verdier quotient
Z
perZR/Db(ﬂ
R) lies on the context of Iyama–Yang’s formulation [IYa1] of Amiot’s cluster category, see
Theorem 2.6 and Theorem 4.4, which consequently yields a cluster tilting subcategory.

Z
R/ ﬂ

Theorem 1.2 (Theorem 4.4(3)). Let R be a graded bimodule (d + 1)-CY algebra of a-invariant a satisfying
(R0) and (R1). Then the subcategory

is a (d + a)-cluster tilting subcategory.

add{R(−i)[i] | i ∈ Z} ⊂ qper

R

For example, by setting R to be the polynomial ring with standard positive grading, we deduce that the
derived category of coherent sheaves over the projective space Pd has a (2d + 1)-cluster tilting subcategory
add{O(i)[i] | i ∈ Z} (cf. [HIO]).

Now we compare the derived categories of the graded algebra R and that of the DG algebra Rdg. An

important step is to consider the total module (see Section 5), which gives a DG functor

Z
Tot : C(Mod

R) → Cdg(Rdg)

on the DG categories of complexes of graded R-modules and of DG Rdg-modules, and in turn induces a
functor on the derived categories. We deduce the following result as a consequence of Theorem 1.2 above.

Corollary 1.3 (Theorem 6.1). The functor Tot induces a fully faithful functor

Z

qper

R/(−1)[1] → C(Rdg)

whose image generates C(Rdg) as a thick subcategory.

This is a cluster category analogue of the result in [KY, Theorem 1.3] for the perfect derived category.
Note that this gives a reasonable description of the cluster category since on C(Rdg) the degree shift and
the suspension is identiﬁed, and more accessible in the sense that derived categories are sometimes explicitly
described.

Now we apply Minamoto–Mori’s equivalence [MM] (see Proposition 4.6); there exists a triangle equivalence

qperZR ≃ Db(mod A) for the ﬁnite dimensional algebra

(1.1)

A = A(R) = 

This algebra is d-representation inﬁnite, which is fundamental in higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory
[HIO] and non-commutative algebraic geometry [Mi, MM]. By the derived equivalence above we deduce that
A DA[−d] of Db(mod A) has an a-th root ν1/a
the autoequivalence νd = − ⊗L
(see (4.1)). Then we can rewrite
Corollary 1.3 as a fully faithful functor

whose image generates C(Rdg) as a thick subcategory. Note that we can formally write ν−1/a
[1] as ν−1/a
d+a ,
thus C(Rdg) can be regarded as a ‘Z/aZ-quotient’ of the (d + a)-cluster category of A in the sense that it is
obtained from an a-th root of the automorphism νd+a.

The existence of a square root of the AR translation appears in [KMV] and was important in their
structure theorem for certain CY categories [KMV, Theorem 1.4]. Our result (1.2) is an interpretation and
a generalization of a situation of their theorem. We discuss in examples (see Example 4.10 and 6.6) how our
results specialize to their setting.

1.2. Cluster categories and singularity categories. We further describe the cluster category as a sin-
gularity category. Recall that the singularity category Dsg(Λ) of a Noetherian ring Λ is the Verdier quo-
tient Db(mod Λ)/ per Λ, which is widely studied in representation theory and algebraic geometry. If Λ is
Iwanaga-Gorenstein in the sense that the free module Λ has ﬁnite injective dimension on left and right,
then Dsg(Λ) is canonically equivalent to the stable category CM Λ of Cohen-Macaulay modules [Bu].
In
the context of cluster tilting theory, Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras which are stably CY and admit cluster
tilting objects, together with the relationship between the cluster categories, have been of particular interest
[GLS, I1, KR1, IYo, Am, BIRS, AIRT, ART, KMV, IO, AO, AIR, TV].

Let a ﬁnite dimensional algebra A = A(R) as in (1.1) and an (A, A)-bimodule U be

which turns out to be d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein (Proposition 6.3). Our second main result is a description of
the cluster category C(Rdg) of a DG algebra in terms of a ﬁnite dimensional Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B.

B = B(R) = A ⊕ U,

Theorem 1.4 (Theorem 6.4). There exists a triangle equivalence

C(Rdg) ≃ Dsg(B)

In particular, Dsg(B) is a twisted (d + a)-CY category with a (d + a)-cluster tilting object.

To build the equivalence above, we need a general result on DG orbit categories (Theorem 1.5 below).

Let us explain the connection, for simplicity, in the case a = 1.

In this case, R is bimodule (d + 1)-CY of a-invariant 1, thus it is the (d + 1)-preprojective algebra of its
degree 0 part, which is A in (1.1). Then Rdg is the derived (d + 2)-preprojective algebra (or the (d + 2)-CY
completion)

Πd+2(A) = T L

A RHomA(DA, A)[d + 1]

in the sense of [Ke6], thus its cluster category C(Rdg) is the (d + 1)-cluster category Cd+1(A) of A. On the
other hand, we have another description of this cluster category Cd+1(A) as a certain singularity category;
setting

there exists an equivalence

C = A ⊕ DA[−d − 2],

C(Rdg) = per Rdg/Db(Rdg) ≃ thickD(C) A/ per C
by the relative Koszul dual [Am]. Therefore the equivalence we need is one between the singularity categories

thickD(C) A/ per C ≃ thickD(B) A/ per B = Dsg(B).
Note that they are precisely Keller’s description of triangulated hulls [Ke2], and their equivalence is a
consequence of a general equivalence of triangulated hulls, which is our third main result.

Let A be a pretriangulated DG category, and let F , G be DG endofunctors on A inducing mutually
inverse equivalences on H 0A. We then have DG orbit categories A/F and A/G, whose perfect derived
categories give triangulated hulls of H 0A/H 0F ≃ H 0A/H 0G. Our result shows that these triangulated
hulls are equivalent.

CLUSTER CATEGORIES AND SINGULARITY CATEGORIES

Theorem 1.5 (Theorem 7.1). Suppose there exists a natural transformation G ◦ F → 1A inducing a natural
isomorphism on H 0A. Then the DG orbit categories A/F and A/G are quasi-equivalent. In particular, the
triangulated hulls per(A/F ) and per(A/G) are equivalent.

We obtain the singular equivalence of B and C by applying this general result to A = Cb(proj A),
F = − ⊗A p(RHomA(U [1], A)), and G = − ⊗A p(U [1]) (Corollary 7.6), where p(−) means a bimodule
projective resolution.

As one of applications and examples of our main results, we give a realization of certain higher cluster

categories as singularity categories.

Theorem 1.6 (Theorem 9.1). Any m-cluster category of a d-representation inﬁnite algebra with m > d is
a singularity category of a d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra.

For example, any (higher) cluster category of a non-Dynkin quiver is the singularity category of a 1-
Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra. Moreover, we can explicitly describe the Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra, see
Theorem 9.1 and Proposition 9.4. This should be compared with the results in [HJ], where they give a
description of higher cluster categories of 1-representation ﬁnite algebras (or of Dynkin types) in terms of
singularity categories of self-injective algebras, using a combinatorial method.

We also give systematic examples for the case R is a polynomial ring (Section 10), and consider examples

arising from dimer models (Section 11).

2. Preliminaries

We recall some basic concepts on certain structures in triangulated categories. At the end of this section
we state Iyama–Yang’s result (Theorem 2.6) which gives a general framework for the construction of ‘cluster-
like’ categories.

Let us start with the following fundamental notion.

Deﬁnition 2.1. An object or a subcategory M in a triangulated category T is silting if HomT (M, M[>
0]) = 0 and thick M = T .

The standard example of a silting object is Λ ∈ per Λ for a negative DG algebra Λ, that is, a DG algebra

with H >0Λ = 0. The same holds for negative DG categories.

Let C and D be subcategories of a triangulated category T . We set

C ∗ D = {X ∈ T | there is a triangle C → X → D → C[1] for some C ∈ C, D ∈ D}.

By the octahedral axiom, the operation ∗ is associative. One obtains a co-t-structure (or weight structure)
[Bon, P] from a silting subcategory, which is given as follows.

Proposition-Deﬁnition 2.2 (See [AI, Proposition 2.17]). Let T be an idempotent complete triangulated
category with a silting subcategory M. Set

t≥0 =

M[−l] ∗ · · · ∗ M[−1] ∗ M,

[l≥0

t≤0 =

M ∗ M[1] ∗ · · · ∗ M[l]

Then (t≥0, t≤0) is a co-t-structure. We call it the co-t-structure associated to M.

[l≥0

In what follows, we will simply write t≥0 = · · · ∗ M, t≤0 = M ∗ · · · and so on. It is important for us that

some co-t-structures and t-structures are related.

Deﬁnition 2.3 ([Bon]). Let M ⊂ T be a silting subcategory and (t≥0, t≤0) the associated co-t-structure.
Let t = (t≤0, t≥0) be a t-structure in T .

(1) We say t is right adjacent to M if t≤0 = t≤0.
(2) We say t is left adjacent to M if t≥0 = t≥0.

6

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

For example, if Λ be a negative DG algebra which is homologically smooth such that each cohomology is
ﬁnite dimensional, then the standard t-structure on per Λ is right adjacent to a silting object Λ ∈ per Λ. It
follows that its image under the duality RHomΛ(−, Λ) : per Λ ↔ per Λop is left adjacent to a silting object
Λ ∈ per Λop.

Now let us recall the notion of (relative) Serre functors.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let T be a k-linear Hom-ﬁnite triangulated category and T fd ⊂ T a thick subcategory.
(1) An autoequivalence S : T → T is a Serre functor on T if there is a functorial isomorphism

HomT (X, Y ) ≃ D HomT (Y, SX)

for all X, Y ∈ T .

(2) An autoequivalence S : T fd → T fd is a relative Serre functor for T fd ⊂ T if the above functorial

isomorphism holds for all X ∈ T fd and Y ∈ T .

(3) We say that (T , T fd, S, M) is a relative Serre quadruple if S is a relative Serre functor for T fd ⊂ T

and M is a silting subcategory of T .

We have one more notion to recall.

Deﬁnition 2.5. A k-linear category C is a dualizing variety if D = Homk(−, k) induces a duality mod C ↔
mod Cop between the category of ﬁnitely presented C-modules.

Z
For example, the category proj Λ (resp. proj
ﬁnite dimensional algebra Λ is a dualizing variety.

Λ) of ﬁnitely generated (graded) projective modules over a

We are now ready to state the following generalized formulation of Amiot’s cluster category.

Theorem 2.6 ([IYa1, IYa2]). Let (T , T fd, S, M) be a relative Serre quadruple such that M is a dualizing
variety, and (t≥0, t≤0) be the co-t-structure associated to M.

(1) The silting subcategory M has a right adjacent t-structure with t⊥

≤0 ⊂ T fd if and only if it has a left

adjacent t-structure with ⊥t≥0 ⊂ T fd.

Suppose in what follows the equivalent conditions above are satisﬁed.

(2) The quotient functor π : T → T /T fd induces bijections HomT (X, Y ) → HomT /T fd (X, Y ) for all
X ∈ t≤0 and Y ∈ St≥2. In particular the composition t≤0 ∩ St≥2 ⊂ T → T /T fd is an additive
equivalence.

(3) Let n ≥ 1 and assume M is stable under Sn+1 = S ◦ [−n − 1]. Then π(M) ⊂ T /T fd is an n-cluster

tilting subcategory.

Proof. (1) is [IYa1, Theorem 4.10]. For (2), adapt the proof of [IYa1, Proposition 5.9]. We include a proof
of (3) since it requires a modiﬁcation from [IYa1, Theorem 5.8]. Since M is stable under Sn+1, so is t≥i
for each i ∈ Z, thus we have St≥2 = Sn+1t≥1−n = t≥1−n = · · · ∗ M[n − 1]. Therefore we deduce that the
(cid:3)
fundamental domain is M ∗ · · · ∗ M[n − 1], hence the result.

If Λ is a bimodule (n + 1)-CY negative DG algebra with ﬁnite dimensional H 0Λ, then (per Λ, Db(Λ), [n +
1], Λ) is a relative Serre quadruple. One can apply the above theorem and recover the original results of
Amiot and Guo.

3. t-structure in perZR

We will be interested in a negatively graded CY algebra with an a-invariant. Before that we will place
i≤0 Ri be a negatively graded algebra. We assume the

ourselves in a slightly general setting. Let R =
following on R.

(R1) Each Ri is ﬁnite dimensional.
(R2) Any ﬁnite length R-module has ﬁnite projective dimension.

L

The condition (R2) is clearly satisﬁed if R is homologically smooth. The aim of this section is to show that
there is a t-structure in perZR in this setting.

CLUSTER CATEGORIES AND SINGULARITY CATEGORIES

Theorem 3.1. Let R be a negatively graded algebra satisfying (R1) and (R2). Set

t≤0 = {X ∈ per
t≥0 = {X ∈ per

Z

Z

R | H i(X) ∈ Mod≤−iR for all i ∈ Z},
R | H i(X) ∈ Mod≥−iR for all i ∈ Z}.

Then (t≤0, t≥0) is a t-structure in perZR.

Remark 3.2. Under the assumption that R is Noetherian (or more generally graded coherent), there is a
version of this for Db(mod
R) without the ‘smoothness’ condtion (R2), which is in practice far more general
than Theorem 3.1 above. We give this general result in Appendix B.

Z

In the remainder of this section we simply write D for D(Mod

R). Recall from [AI, Deﬁnition 4.1] that
a subcategory S of a triangulated category T with arbitrary (set-indexed) coproducts is silting if it forms
a compact set of generators such that HomT (A, B[> 0]) = 0 for all A, B ∈ S. Note that this is a modiﬁed
version of Deﬁnition 2.1.

Z

We start our discussion with the following observation.

Proposition 3.3. The subcategory M = add{R(−i)[i] | i ∈ Z} ⊂ D is silting.

Proof. Clearly M is a compact set of generators for D. It remains to show that HomD(R, R(−i)[i][j]) vanishes
for each i ∈ Z and j > 0. We only have to consider the case i = −j < 0, in which case HomD(R, R(−i)[i][j]) =
Z
(cid:3)
R(R, R(j)) = 0 since R is negatively graded.
Hom

We deduce by [Ke1, Theorem 4.3] that D is triangle equivalent to the derived category D(A) of a negative
M ) associated to M, which is given

DG category A. Then we can consider the standard t-structure (D≤0
by

M , D≥0

D≤0
D≥0

M = {X ∈ D | HomD(M, X[i]) = 0 for all M ∈ M and i > 0.},
M = {X ∈ D | HomD(M, X[i]) = 0 for all M ∈ M and i < 0.}.

Now we use the following computation.

Lemma 3.4. We have

D≤0
D≥0

M = {X ∈ D | H i(X) ∈ Mod≤−iR for all i ∈ Z},
M = {X ∈ D | H i(X) ∈ Mod≥−iR for all i ∈ Z}.

Proof. Since D≤0

M = M[< 0]⊥, we have

D≤0

M = {X ∈ D | HomD(R(i)[−i][−j], X) = 0 for all i ∈ Z and j > 0}

= {X ∈ D | H i+j(X)−i = 0 for all i ∈ Z and j > 0}
= {X ∈ D | H i(X)−i+j = 0 for all i ∈ Z and j > 0},

thus the ﬁrst assertion. By D≥0

M = M[> 0]⊥, we similarly have the second equation.

(cid:3)

We need one lemma to ensure that the above t-structure in D restricts to the small derived category.

Lemma 3.5. Consider the truncation triangle X ′ → X → X ′′ → X ′[1] for X ∈ D with X ′ ∈ D≤0

X ′′ ∈ D≥1

Proof. (1) It is enough to show that the connecting homomorphism H iX ′′ → H i+1X ′ is 0 for each i ∈ Z.
Since X ′ ∈ D≤0
M , we have H iX ′′ ∈ Mod≥i+1R and H i+1X ∈ Mod≤−i−1R, hence the
assertion.
(2) Similarly, we have H iX ′ ∈ Mod≤−iR and H iX ′′ ∈ Mod≥−i+1R, thus the exact sequence in (1) has to
(cid:3)
be the truncation of H iX with respect to the grading.

M and X ′′ ∈ D≥1

We are now ready to prove the main result.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. We show that the above t-structure in D restricts to perZR. Let X ∈ perZR. We
have to show that its truncation X ′, X ′′ in Lemma 3.5 are perfect. We may replace X by a bounded complex
of ﬁnitely generated graded projective R-modules. Then we have that H iX = 0 for almost all i and that
Z
R is bounded above. Moreover by assumption (R1), each vector space (H iX)j is ﬁnite
each H iX ∈ Mod
dimensional. Then by Lemma 3.5(1) the cohomology H iX ′′ is 0 for almost all i and by Lemma 3.5(2) that

each H iX ′′ ∈ Mod

conclude that the remaining term X ′ is also perfect.

R is bounded below. Therefore H iX ′′ lies in Db(ﬂ

4. Cluster tilting in qperZR and the a-th root of the AR translation

which is of our central interest. For a graded automorphism α of a graded ring Λ, we denote by (−)α the
Z
twist automorphism on Mod

Λ.

Deﬁnition 4.1. A graded algebra R is bimodule twisted n-Calabi-Yau of a-invariant a if it satisﬁes the
following conditions.

• R is homologically smooth, that is, R ∈ perZRe.
Re).
• There exists a graded automorphism α of R such that RHomRe(R, Re)(a)[n] ≃ αR1 in D(Mod
We refer to α as the Nakayama automorphism, which is uniquely determined up to inner automorphism.
We say that R is Calabi-Yau if α is inner.

Z

Let R be a negatively graded bimodule twisted (d + 1)-CY algebra of a-invariant a with Nakayama

automorphism α. We moreover assume that each Ri is ﬁnite dimensional over k.

Z
Let us ﬁrst collect some basic facts on the derived categories Db(ﬂ

R), perZR, and qperZR.

Proposition 4.2.

Z
(1) Db(ﬂ

R) ⊂ perZR has a relative Serre functor (−)α(a)[d + 1].

(2) qperZR has a Serre functor (−)α(a)[d].

Proof. We include a sketch of the proof for the convenience of the reader. (1) follows from [Ke4, Lemma 4.1].
Z
To prove (2), we apply [Am, Section 1]. For this we construct for each X, Y ∈ perZR a local Db(ﬂ
R)-envelope
of X relative to Y in the sense of [Am, Deﬁnition 1.2]. Take a projective resolution P → Y and pick an
integer n such that each term of P is generated in degree ≥ n. Consider the exact sequence 0 → X<n → X →
Z
X≥n → 0 in Cb(Mod
R)
and it yields a triangle in perZR. Since HomDb(ModZR)(Y, X<n) = HomKb(ModZR)(P, X<n) = 0, we see that

X → X≥n gives a local envelope.

Z

We need the following reformulation of Proposition 3.3.

Proposition 4.3. M = add{R(−i)[i] | i ∈ Z} is a silting subcategory of perZR.

Proof. We have seen in Proposition 3.3 that M has no positive self-extensions. Also we clearly have
thick M = perZR.
(cid:3)

Therefore we obtain a relative Serre quadruple (perZR, Db(ﬂ

(2) The quotient functor π : perZR → qperZR induces bijections HomperZR(X, Y ) → HomqperZR(X, Y )
for each X ∈ M ∗ · · · and Y ∈ · · · ∗ M[d + a − 1]. In particular, π has a fundamental domain
M ∗ · · · ∗ M[d + a − 1].

(3) π(M) = add{R(−i)[i] | i ∈ Z} ⊂ qperZR is a (d + a)-cluster tilting subcategory.
In the proof below, we write D = perZR and Dfd = Db(ﬂ
R).
Z
Proof. (1) Since M = add{R(−i)[i] | i ∈ Z}, we have M ≃ proj
hence M is a dualizing variety.

We next show that the silting subcategory M ⊂ D has left and right adjacent t-structures. By Theorem
2.6(1), it suﬃces to show the existence of the right adjacent t-structure with t⊥
≤0 ⊂ Dfd. Set t≤0 = t≤0 and
t≥0 = (t≤−1)⊥, where t≤n = t≤0[−n] and so on. Note that t≤0 = M[< 0]⊥ and t≥0 = (t≤−1)⊥ = M[> 0]⊥.
Then as in Lemma 3.4 we have

t≤0 = {X ∈ D | H i(X) ∈ Mod≤−iR for all i ∈ Z},
t≥0 = {X ∈ D | H i(X) ∈ Mod≥−iR for all i ∈ Z}.

Now the assertion that (t≤0, t≥0) is a t-structure is precisely what we showed in Theorem 3.1, and clearly
t≥0 ⊂ Dfd.

(2)(3) Let S = (−)α(a)[d + 1] be the relative Serre functor for Dfd ⊂ D. Then Sd+a+1 = (−)α(a)[−a]
preserves M. Therefore we have St≥2 = Sd+a+1t≥−d−a+1 = t≥−d−a+1, hence (2) by Theorem 2.6(2), and
(cid:3)
(3) by Theorem 2.6(3).

4.2. Tilting and the a-th root of the AR-translation. In this subsection we note the result due to
Minamoto–Mori [MM], and give a ﬁnite dimensional algebra A which will play a crucial role in the sequel.
Before that let us recall the following notion.

Deﬁnition 4.5 ([HIO]). A ﬁnite dimensional algebra Λ is d-representation inﬁnite if gl. dim Λ ≤ d and

holds for all i ≥ 0, where νd is the autoequivalence − ⊗L
Proposition 4.6 ([MM, Theorem 4.12]). Let R be a negatively graded bimodule twisted (d + 1)-CY algebra
of a-invariant a such that each Ri is ﬁnite dimensional.

(2) A = EndqperZR(T ) is d-representation inﬁnite.

Therefore there exists a triangle equivalence qperZR ≃ Db(mod A).

L

Proof. We will include a proof using Theorem 4.4 in Appendix C. Here we note a complementary discussion
Z
R by the torsion R-modules, where a graded R-module
to [MM]. Let QGr R be the Serre quotient of Mod
is torsion if any of its element is annihilated by R≤n for some n ≤ 0. By [MM] there is a triangle equivalence
D(QGr R) ≃ D(Mod A) of big derived categories. Consider its restriction to the thick subcategories of
compact objects. By [BV, MM], D(QGr R) is compactly generated by T , so the compact objects are thick T
[N], thus qperZR. Similarly the compact objects in D(Mod A) are Db(mod A).
(cid:3)

We are now in the position to state the following important consequence. Suppose in what follows that
(−)α ≃ 1 on qperZR, for example, that R is CY. Let A be the d-representation-inﬁnite algebra given in
Proposition 4.6, and let F be the autoequivalence on Db(mod A) making the diagram below commutative.

(cid:3)
on Db(mod A) are compatible, hence we obtain the desired result.

Let us give some easy examples of an a-th root of the AR translation.

Example 4.8. Let R = k[x, y] with deg x = deg y = −1, so R is 2-CY of a-invariant 2. Applying Proposition
4.6, we have a well-known equivalence Db(qgr R) ≃ Db(mod A) with A the Kronecker algebra. The AR-quiver

The existence of a square root of the AR translation appears in [KMV] for generalized Kronecker quivers.

5. CY algebras as DG algebras

We will consider a graded algebra R as a DG algebra with the same underlying graded ring and the

vanishing diﬀerential. We write Rdg when considering R as a DG algebra.

We ﬁrst collect some sign conventions which is heavily used in this section. Throughout this section we

denote by |x| the degree of a homogeneous element x in a graded vector space.

Convention 5.1. Let Λ and Γ be DG algebras.

(1) Let X be a DG right Λ-module. Then its shift X[1] has the same right Λ-action as X.
(2) Let X be a DG left Λ-module. Then its shift X[1] has a left Λ-action a · x = (−1)|a|ax for a ∈ Λ

and x ∈ X[1].

(3) There is an isomorphism HomΛ(Λ[−l], Λ) ≃ Λ[l] of DG left Λ-modules by f 7→ (−1)l|f |f (1).
(4) We identify (Λe)op ≃ Λe via x ⊗ y ↔ (−1)|x||y|y ⊗ x.
(5) We identify a DG (Λ, Γ)-bimodule X and a DG Λop ⊗k Γ-module via λ · x · γ = (−1)|λ||x|x · (λ ⊗ γ).

We say that a DG algebra Λ is twisted bimodule n-CY if it is homologically smooth and there exists a
DG automorphism σ of Λ such that we have an isomorphism RHomΛe (Λ, Λe)[n] ≃ 1Λσ in D(Λe). The aim
of this section is to note the following observation. Note that the term ‘CY algebra’ means precisely as in
Deﬁnition 4.1, and no additional conditions are imposed.

Theorem 5.2. Let R be a graded bimodule n-CY algebra of a-invariant a. Then, Rdg is twisted bimodule
(n + a)-CY. Precisely we have the following.

(1) If a is odd, then Rdg is CY.
(2) If a is even, then Rdg is homologically smooth and RHom(Rdg)e(R, (Rdg)e)[n + a] ≃ 1Rσ for the

automorphism σ : x 7→ (−1)|x|x of R.

Let us introduce some notations. For a DG algebra Λ, we denote by C(Λ) = Z 0Cdg(Λ) the (abelian)
category of DG Λ-modules. Let X be a graded (R, R)-bimodule. We can view it as a DG (Rdg, Rdg)-
bimodule with trivial diﬀerentials, hence as an (Rdg)e-module, which gives a functor

Z
(−)dg : Mod

Re −→ C((Rdg)e).

We note the following sign-conventional lemmas. The proofs are left to the reader.

Lemma 5.3. Let F = Re(l) be a free Re-module. Then, F dg is isomorphic to the free DG (Rdg)e-module
(Rdg)e[l]. The isomorphism is given by

F dg −→ (Rdg)e[l],

x ⊗ y 7→ (−1)l|x|x ⊗ y.

Lemma 5.4. Let X ∈ Mod

Re and l ∈ Z. Then we have an isomorphism (σl X(l))dg ≃ X dg[l] in C((Rdg)e).

Let us now recall the notion of total module of a complex of DG modules. We consider two variations;

For a complex X = (· · · → X i−1 → X i → X i+1 → · · · ) of DG Λ-modules and a DG Λ-module Y , we

denote by HomΛ(X, Y ) the complex

The following is quite useful for computations.

Lemma 5.5. Let Λ and Γ be DG algebras and X a complex of DG Λ-modules. Then for any DG (Γ, Λ)-
bimodule Y , we have an isomorphism HomΛ(Tot X, Y ) ≃

Tot HomΛ(X, Y ) of left DG Γ-modules.

i∈Z HomΛ(X i, Y )i+n, thus two sides
Proof. It is easily veriﬁed that the degree n part of each side is
coincide as graded vector spaces. Now we check that this identiﬁcation is compatible with the diﬀerentials
and the Γ-actions.

On the one hand, the diﬀerential on the left-hand-side maps f ∈ HomΛ(X i, Y )i+n ⊂ HomΛ(Tot X, Y ) to

On the other hand, the diﬀerential of the right-hand-side maps f ∈ HomΛ(X i, Y )i+n ⊂

Then one can check that the map HomΛ(Tot X, Y ) →

Λ the

category of (not necessarily ﬁnitely generated) graded free modules over a graded ring Λ.

Proof. First we deﬁne an isomorphism ϕP : F (P ) → G(P ) at the free module P = Re(l). Clearly we have
F (P ) = R ⊗ R(−l), with the action of R given by b · (x ⊗ y) · a = (−1)|b|xa ⊗ by. On the other hand, using
Lemma 5.3 we see G(P ) = R ⊗ R[−l], with the R-action b · (x ⊗ y) · a = (−1)|a|(|b|+|y|)+|b|(l+|x|)xa ⊗ by for
x, y ∈ R. Now we deﬁne an isomorphism F (P ) = R ⊗ R(−l) → R ⊗ R(−l) = G(P ) by the formula

We can readily check that this is (R, R)-bilinear.

Proof of Theorem 5.2. Let P = (· · · → P1 −→ P0) be a free resolution of R in C−(Mod
cohomology of P ∨ = HomRe(P, Re) is concentrated in degree n, where it is R(−a). Considering P as a
complex P dg of DG bimodules as above, the total sum of P dg gives an (Rdg)e-coﬁbrant resolution of the
DG (Rdg)e-module R. Then RHom(Rdg)e (R, (Rdg)e) = Hom(Rdg)e (Tot P dg, (Rdg)e), which is isomorphic by
Lemma 5.5 to the total product of the complex

Example 5.7. Let R = k[x1, · · · , xn] be the polynomial ring.

d

(1) Set deg xi = −1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then R is bimodule n-CY of a-invariant n. By Theorem 5.2, we

see that

• Rdg is 2n-CY if n is odd.
• Rdg is twisted 2n-CY if n is even.

See Example 5.8 below for an illustration in n = 2 how Rdg fails to be CY.

(2) Set deg xi = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then R is bimodule n-CY of a-invariant −n. By Theorem 5.2, we

see that

• Rdg is 0-CY if n is odd.
• Rdg is twisted 0-CY if n is even.

This partially recovers [MGYC, Theorem 6.4], see also [HM, Example 6.1].

(3) Set deg xi = 2 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Then R is bimodule n-CY of a-invariant −2n. By Theorem 5.2, we
have RHom(Rdg)e(R, (Rdg)e)[−n] ≃ 1Rσ. Note that the automorphism σ is the identity since R is
concentrated in even degrees. Therefore we conclude that Rdg is (−n)-CY. This partially recovers
[MGYC, Theorem 6.2].

We explicitly demonstrate how Rdg fails to be CY.

Example 5.8. Let R = k[x, y] with deg x = deg y = −1. Then the graded ring R is bimodule 2-CY of
a-invariant 2, and has the Koszul resolution, which we depict in the following way.

whose total module is RHomS(R, S) by Lemma 5.5. We therefore see that RHomS(R, S)[4] ≃ 1Rσ.

The appearance of the twist automorphism σ suggests that we should twist the multiplication of the CY
algebra R in order that the DG algebra Rdg to be CY. Let us give an instance where R is twisted CY and
Rdg is CY.

Example 5.9. Let m ≥ 2 and

R = khx1, . . . , xmi /(x2

1 + · · · + x2

deg xi = −1,

If m = 2, this is a skew polynomial ring with 2 variables; compare Example 5.8 above. For all m ≥ 2, this
algebra is Artin-Schelter regular of dimension 2 (see Example 4.10). Recall that the bimodule projective

Applying HomS(−, S), we get an isomorphic complex, thus we see that RHomS(R, S)[4] ≃ R in D(S).

6. Cluster categories, derived orbit categories, and singularity categories

Let R be a CY algebra. We state main results of this paper which describes the cluster category of Rdg

as an orbit category and a singularity category.

6.1. Cluster categories and orbit categories. Let R be a negatively graded bimodule (d+1)-CY algebra
of a-invariant a such that each Ri is ﬁnite dimensional. In this subsection, we compare the derived category
of R considered as a graded ring, and that of R considered as a DG algebra Rdg with vanishing diﬀerentials.
By Theorem 5.2, we know that Rdg is twisted bimodule (d + a + 1)-CY.

Recall the notion of total module from the previous section. As in the previous section, consider the DG

functor

Tot : Cb

dg(Mod

Z

R) → Cdg(Rdg).

Z
Taking the 0-th cohomology, it induces a triangle functor Kb(Mod
complexes to acyclic DG modules. We therefore obtain a triangle functor

R) → K(Rdg), which clearly takes acyclic

Note that this restricts to Db(ﬂ

R) → Db(Rdg), thus it again induces a triangle functor,
R → C(Rdg).

Tot : qper

Z

The following result gives a natural and more concrete description of the cluster category of Rdg. Similar

type of results for derived or singularity categories are recently obtained in [KY, Bri].
Theorem 6.1. The functor Tot : qperZR → C(Rdg) induces a fully faithful functor

qperZR/(−1)[1]

/ C(Rdg)

whose image generates C(Rdg) as a thick subcategory. Therefore, C(Rdg) is a triangulated hull of the orbit
category qperZR/(−1)[1].
Proof. Note that the cluster tilting subcategory M = add{R(−i)[i] | i ∈ Z} ⊂ qperZR given in Theorem 4.4
is mapped to a cluster tilting object R ∈ C(Rdg), and the functor Tot induces an equivalence M/(−1)[1] ≃−→
add R. Therefore the assertion follows from covering version of the ‘cluster-Beilinson criterion’, see [KR2,
(cid:3)
Lemma 4.5].

Let A be the d-representation inﬁnite algebra given in Proposition 4.6 as the endomorphism ring of a

tilting object in qperZR. Explicitly, we have

Proposition 6.3.

(1) U is a cotilting bimodule over A.

(2) B is a d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra.

(cid:3)
bimodule over A = EndqperZR(T ). Then the second assertion follows from [MY, Theorem 4.3].

Now we state the second main result of this paper.

Theorem 6.4. There exists a triangle equivalence

C(Rdg) ≃ Dsg(B).

In particular, Dsg(B) is a twisted (d + a)-CY category with a (d + a)-cluster tilting object.

We postpone the proof of this result to Section 8 since it requires a general result on DG orbit categories,

which we give in the following section.

6.3. Examples. Before going on let us give some demonstrations our results. See Section 9, 10, 11 for
systematic examples.

Example 6.5. Let us start with an almost trivial example. Let

R = k[x],

deg x = −1.

This is bimodule 1-CY of a-invariant 1, thus Rdg is bimodule 2-CY by Theorem 5.2. We have A = k (which
is ‘0-representation inﬁnite’) and U = k, thus B = A ⊕ U = k[t]/(t2). By Corollary 6.2 and Theorem 6.4,
we have equivalences of triangulated categories

Db(mod k)/[1] ≃ C(Rdg) ≃ Dsg(k[t]/(t2)),

which are triangulated categories with 1 point. See Example A.5 for a generalization, where the case
deg x = −n for arbitrary n ≥ 1 is discussed.

Example 6.6. This is a continuation of Example 4.10 and 5.9. Let m ≥ 2 and set

R = khx1, . . . , xmi /(x2

1 + · · · + x2

m),

deg xi = −1,

which is twisted 2-CY of a-invariant 2 (Example 4.10), and Rdg is 4-CY (Example 5.9). The 1-representation
inﬁnite algebra A is the path algebra of the m-Kronecker quiver Qm : • m−→ •, and the autoequivalence ν1 of
Db(mod kQm) has a square root (Example 4.10). Also it is not diﬃcult to see that the 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein
algebra B is presented by the following quiver with relations.

[1] ≃ Dsg(B) ≃ C(Rdg).

Remark 6.7. In [KMV, Theorem 1.4], Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh proved that any algebraic 3-CY trian-
gulated category T with a 3-cluster tilting object T such that EndT (T ) = k and HomT (T, T [−1]) = km is
triangle equivalent to Db(mod kQm)/τ −1/2[1], where τ −1/2 is the square root of the AR translation deﬁned
in [KMV] using reﬂection functors.

Now, since C = C(Rdg) is a 3-CY category with a cluster tilting object R satisfying EndC(R) = k and
HomC(R, R[−1]) = km, the above equivalent triangulated categories are precisely the 3-CY category in
[KMV, Theorem 1.4]. Our result shows that the 3-CY category in [KMV] is also the singularity category
of B, and can be realized as the cluster category of the DG algebra Rdg. We refer to Example A.6 for a
generalization, which covers the situation in [KMV, Remark 3.4.5].

7. Quasi-equivalence of DG orbit categories

Let T be a triangulated category and F : T → T an autoequivalence. In order to discuss when the orbit
category T /F is triangulated, a triangulated hull of this orbit category was constructed by Keller [Ke2].
The idea was to take an orbit at the level of enhancement of T .

Let A be a pretriangulated DG category and F a DG endofunctor on A inducing an equivalence on H 0A.
Then the DG orbit category of A with respect to F , which we denote by B = A/F , is the DG category with
the same objects as A and with the morphism complex

B(L, M ) = colim



A(F nL, M ) F−→

A(F nL, F M ) F−→

A(F nL, F 2M ) F−→ · · ·



It follows that we have H 0A/H 0F = H 0B, hence per B is a triangulated hull of
for each L, M ∈ B.
H 0A/H 0F in the sense that there is a fully faithful functor H 0A/H 0F ֒→ per B whose image generates
per B as a thick subcategory.

Observe that the above embedding is not dense in general, and thus it is not clear a naive expectation

for orbit categories carries over to triangulated hulls. We give an answer to one of such problems.

Let us brieﬂy recall some relevant notions, see [Ke1, Section 7] for details. Let B and C be DG categories.
A quasi-functor C → B is a (C, B)-bimodule X, whose value we denote by X(B, C) for B ∈ B and C ∈ C,
such that the DG B-module X(−, C) is isomorphic in D(B) to a representable DG B-module for each C ∈ C.
A quasi-functor X : C → B is a quasi-equivalence if − ⊗L
C X : D(C) → D(B) is a triangle equivalence. In this
case the equivalence restricts to per C ≃−→ per B.

Theorem 7.1. Let A be a pretriangulated DG category, and let F , G be DG endofunctors on A such that
H 0F and H 0G are mutually inverse equivalences on H 0A. Suppose that there is a morphism G ◦ F → 1A
of DG functors inducing a natural isomorphism on H 0A. Then the DG orbit categories B = A/F and
C = A/G are quasi-equivalent. In particular, the triangulated hulls per B and per C are triangle equivalent.

Remark 7.2.

(1) We do not need a natural transformation F ◦ G → 1A.

(2) The assumption on the existence of a natural transformation G ◦ F → 1A is satisﬁed in the following
typical case: Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra which is homologically smooth and A = Cb(proj Λ).
Let X a complex of projective (Λ, Λ)-bimodules such that F = − ⊗Λ X : A → A gives an equivalence
on H 0A = Db(mod Λ). Letting Y be the bimodule projective resolution of RHomΛ(X, Λ), G =
− ⊗Λ Y : A → A gives an inverse of F on Db(mod Λ). Moreover, a quasi-isomorphism Y ⊗Λ X → Λ
of (Λ, Λ)-bimodule complexes gives a natural transformation G ◦ F → 1A.

In view of relating the categories B and C, consider the following direct system of complexes indexed by

N × N:

of the (q + 1)-st row. We can regard Uq(−, M ) as a DG B-module for each M ∈ A as follows: Let
b ∈ B(K, L) a morphism represented by F mK → F rL and u ∈ Uq(L, M ) an element represented by
Gp+qF nL → GqM . Enlarging n if necessarily we may assume r ≤ n. Then deﬁne u · b by the composition
Gp+qF m+n−rK Gp+qF n−rb

−−−−−−−−→ Gp+qF nL u−→ GqM . Since there is a commutative diagram

It is clear that the induced morphism is a quasi-isomorphism since F and G are mutually inverse equiva-
(cid:3)

lences on H 0A.

Note that Uq(−, −) constructed above does not have a C-action. The next step toward relating B and C

is constructing a DG (C, B)-bimodule which is quasi-isomorphic over B to U0.

Lemma 7.4. The vertical maps in (7.1) induce a sequence of quasi-isomorphisms

of DG B-modules for each M ∈ A.

U0(−, M )

/ U1(−, M )

/ U2(−, M )

/ · · ·

Proof. Since the vertical maps in (7.1) are quasi-isomorphisms, the induced map Uq(L, M ) → Uq+1(L, M ) is
a quasi-isomorphism for each q ≥ 0, L ∈ B. It is easily veriﬁed that Uq(−, M ) → Uq+1(−, M ) is B-linear. (cid:3)

Now deﬁne the DG B-module U (−, M ) by the colimit

U (−, M ) := colim
q≥0

Uq(−, M ).

For each L ∈ B we have U (L, M ) = colimp,q≥0

n≥0 A(Gp+qF nL, GqM ).

We observe that U (L, M ) has a left C-action as follows: Let c ∈ C(M, N ) be a morphism presented
by GmM → GrN and u ∈ U (L, M ) an element presented by Gp+qF nL → GqM . Enlarging m and p if
necessarily we may assume q ≤ m and r ≤ p. Then deﬁne c · u by the composition Gp+mF nL Gm−qu
−−−−−→
GmM c−→ GrN .
It is clear that this is well-deﬁned, and compatible with the right B-action. We have
therefore obtained a (C, B)-bimodule U .

L

As a ﬁnal preparation, we describe an equivalence between the orbit categories H 0B and H 0C.

Lemma 7.5. The maps H 0A(F nL, F pM ) Gn+p

←− H 0A(GpL, GnM ) → H 0C(L, M ) induce an equivalence H 0B ≃ H 0C.

−−−→ H 0A(Gn+pF nL, Gn+pF pM ) ≃−→ H 0A(Gn+pF nL, GnM )

Now we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section.

Proof of Theorem 7.1. We show that the (C, B)-bimodule

U (L, M ) = colim
p,q≥0

constructed above gives a quasi-equivalence.

For each M ∈ C we have quasi-isomorphisms

A(Gp+qF nL, GqM )

Mn≥0

of DG B-modules by Lemma 7.3 and Lemma 7.4, thus U is a quasi-functor.

It remains to show that the induced map

uM : B(−, M ) → U0(−, M ) → U (−, M )

is an isomorphism for each L, M ∈ A. It suﬃces to show that the following diagram is commutative:

HomD(C)(C(−, L), C(−, M )) → HomD(B)(U (−, L), U (−, M ))

The equivalence H 0B → H 0C given in Lemma 7.5 shows that if f ∈ H 0B(L, M ) is presented by a morphism
F nL → F pM in Z 0A, then the corresponding morphism g ∈ H 0C(L, M ) is presented by GpL → GnM in
Z 0A so that the diagram

(7.2)

is commutative in H 0A.

Let f and g be of the form above. Then the commutativity we want amounts to saying that uM ·f = g ·uL
in H 0U (L, M ), where we may regard · as the right action of B (resp.
left action of C) on U . Since
uL ∈ U (L, L) is presented by the identity morphism in A the element g · uL ∈ U (L, M ) is presented by
g
Gp+nF nL → GpL 1−→ GpL
−→ GnM . Similarly, since uM ∈ U (M, M ) is presented by the identity morphism
Gpf
in A, the element uM · f ∈ U (L, M ) is presented by GpF nL
−−−→ GpF pM → M , hence by one obtained by
applying Gn. Then the commutativity of the diagram (7.2) in H 0A implies that we have uM · f = g · uL in
(cid:3)
H 0U (L, M ).

Let us apply our general result to the setting of ﬁnite dimensional algebras. Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional
algebra which is homologically smooth, and X a complex of (Λ, Λ)-bimodules such that F = − ⊗L
Λ X gives an
autoequivalence on Db(mod Λ). We assume that for each L, M ∈ Db(mod Λ), we have HomD(Λ)(L, F iM ) = 0
for almost all i ∈ Z.

Let Γ be the trivial extension DG algebra of Λ by X[−1], that is, Γ = Λ ⊕ X[−1] as a complex, and the
multiplication is given by the bimodule structure on X[−1]. Then Keller’s theorem [Ke2, Theorem 2] gives
the equivalence

per B ≃

/ thickD(Γ) Λ/ per Γ

which is compatible with the natural functors from Db(mod Λ).

We have the same equivalence arising from the inverse of F ; Let Y be a bimodule projective resolution
of RHomΛ(X, Λ) and G = − ⊗Λ Y : A → A, which induces a quasi-inverse to F = − ⊗Λ X on Db(mod Λ).
Let C = A/G be the DG orbit category and ∆ = Λ ⊕ Y [−1] be the trivial extension DG algebra so that we
have an equivalence

per C ≃

/ thickD(∆) Λ/ per ∆

By the above equivalences and Theorem 7.1 we deduce the following consequence.

Corollary 7.6. There exists a triangle equivalence

thickD(Γ) Λ/ per Γ

≃

/ thickD(∆) Λ/ per ∆

which is compatible with the projection functors from Db(mod Λ).

Observe that the above result gives a certain singular equivalence of DG algebras Γ and ∆. We end this

section by posing the following question.

Question 7.7. Is it possible to describe the equivalence in Corollary 7.6 directly?

8. Proof of Theorem 6.4

We now give a proof of a main result Theorem 6.4 of this paper using the result from the previous section.
In fact, the essential part of the proof does not depend on our speciﬁc setup, so we ﬁrst state the intermediate
result in Proposition 8.1 below, which can also be viewed as a DG version of Theorem 6.4.

Let Λ be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra which is homologically smooth, X a complex of (Λ, Λ)-bimodules
Λ X gives an autoequivalence on Db(mod Λ). We assume the following on the tilting

such that F = − ⊗L
complex X:

(X1) For each L, M ∈ Db(mod Λ), we have HomD(Λ)(L, F iM ) = 0 for almost all i ∈ Z.
(X2) X is concentrated in degree ≤ 0.

Let

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

Γ = Λ ⊕ X[−1], Σ = T L
be the trivial extension DG algebra, and respectively the derived tensor algebra, that is, the tensor algebra
of a bimodule projective resolution of X. Then the conditions imply that Σ is a negative DG algebra and
its cohomology H 0Σ = TΛ(H 0X) is ﬁnite dimensional.

Λ X

Recall from the introduction that we have denoted by

C(Π) = per Π/Db(Π)
and called it the cluster category for any DG algebra Π satisfying per Π ⊃ Db(Π). Our general intermediate
result is an equivalence between the cluster category of the tensor algebra and the singularity category of
the trivial extension algebra.

Proposition 8.1. The DG algebra Σ satisﬁes per Σ ⊃ Db(Σ), and there exists a triangle equivalence

C(Σ) ≃ thickD(Γ) Λ/ per Γ.

The ﬁrst step is to apply Corollary 7.6. Let Y be a bimodule projective resolution of RHomΛ(X, Λ) and

set

Then we have a triangle equivalence

(8.1)

thickD(Γ) Λ/ per Γ ≃ thickD(∆) Λ/ per ∆.

We next use the following computation of a DG endomorphism algebra.

∆ = Λ ⊕ Y [−1].

Lemma 8.2 (See [Am, Lemma 4.13]). There exists an isomorphism RHom∆(Λ, Λ) ≃ T L
Λ X = Σ in the ho-
motopy category of DG algebras, that is, these two DG algebras are related by a zig-zag of quasi-isomorphisms
of DG algebras.

We also need the equivalence by relative Koszul dual.

Lemma 8.3. The functor RHom∆(Λ, −) : D(∆) → D(Σ) restricts to equivalences thickD(∆) Λ ≃ per Σ and
per ∆ ≃ Db(Σ). Therefore we have per Σ ⊃ Db(Σ) and an equivalence thickD(∆) Λ/ per ∆ ≃−→ C(Σ).
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is clear. We prove second one. Since ∆ = RHomΛ(∆, Y [−1]) as (Λ, ∆)-bimodules,
we have RHom∆(Λ, ∆) = RHom∆(Λ, RHomΛ(∆, Y [−1])) = RHomΛ(Λ, Y [−1]) = Y [−1], which has ﬁnite
dimensional total cohomology. Therefore the functor maps per ∆ into Db(Σ).
It remains to show the
essential surjectivity. Since Σ is a negative DG algebra, the ﬁnite dimensional derived category Db(Σ) has a
bounded t-structure whose heart is equivalent to the category of ﬁnite dimensional modules over H 0Σ, hence
it suﬃces to show that the heart is contained in the image of the functor. Note that H 0Σ = TΛ(H 0X) is a
ﬁnite dimensional graded algebra whose degree 0 part Λ has ﬁnite global dimension. Therefore it is suﬃcient
to prove that DΛ is in the image. Clearly DΛ = RHom∆(Λ, D∆), so it remains to show D∆ ∈ per ∆. But
(cid:3)
we have D∆ = RHomΛ(∆, DΛ) and DΛ ∈ thickD(Λ) Y [−1], hence the assertion.

Proof of Proposition 8.1. It is a consequence of (8.1) and Lemma 8.3.

(cid:3)

We now return to our setup from Section 6. Recall that R is a negatively graded bimodule (d + 1)-CY
algebra of a-invariant a such that each Ri is ﬁnite dimensional, and that A is a d-representation inﬁnite
algebra in Proposition 4.6 given by

A and a d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B = A ⊕ U (see Proposition 6.3).

Let us ﬁrst apply Proposition 8.1. Set Λ = A and X = U [1]. Since U is a preprojective module over a
d-representation inﬁnite algebra, it clearly satisﬁes (X1) and (X2). Then the DG algebra Γ = Λ ⊕ X[−1]

concentrates in degree 0, and is nothing but our Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B = A ⊕ U . Moreover, we see
that the DG algebra Σ is the tensor algebra

with trivial diﬀerentials. Proposition 8.1 for this case gives the following equivalence.

Corollary 8.4. There exists a triangle equivalence

C(S) ≃ Dsg(B).

To compare the cluster categories of S and Rdg, we need another intermediate DG algebra, which is

S := EndR(T ), with T = R ⊕ R[−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ R[−(a − 1)].

Let us ﬁrst state an easy relationship between Rdg and

S. We say that DG algebras Π1 and Π2 are DG
Π1 X induces an equivalence D(Π1) ≃−→

9. Higher cluster categories of higher representation infinite algebras

We give an application of Theorem 6.4, which is given by taking the CY algebra R as a (higher) prepro-
jective algebra. We prove that any m-cluster category of a d-representation inﬁnite algebra with m > d is
the singularity category of a d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra. Moreover we explicitly describe the quiver and
relations of the Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra for the case d = 1, that is, when A is hereditary.

Cd+n(A) ≃ Dsg(B).

Proof. Let Π = TAU be the (d + 1)-preprojective algebra of A. Give a grading on Π by setting deg U = −n
so that Π is a bimodule (d+ 1)-CY algebra of a-invariant n. Note that Πdg is quasi-isomorphic to the derived
(d + n + 1)-preprojective algebra (or the (d + n + 1)-Calabi-Yau completion) T L
A RHomA(DA, A)[d + n], in
the sense of [Ke6]. Therefore the cluster category C(Πdg) is nothing but the (d + n)-cluster category Cd+n(A)
of A. By Theorem 6.4, we have a triangle equivalence C(Πdg) ≃ Dsg(B(Π)) for the d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein
(cid:3)
algebra B(Π) in (8.2) for the Calabi-Yau algebra Π, which is precisely the B above in the statement.

Remark 9.2. We give a general discussion in Appendix A the eﬀect of ‘multiplying gradings’ as we did in
the above proof. See Corollary A.2 for a description as a derived orbit category, which predicts the above
equivalence.

Corollary 9.3. Let Q be a ﬁnite connected acyclic non-Dynkin quiver, A = kQ and ﬁx n ≥ 1. Then we
have a triangle equivalence

for the 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B in Theorem 9.1.

In this case we can explicitly describe the quiver and relations for B.

Q with

• The arrows from Ql+1 to Ql corresponding to the idempotents in A.
• The arrows from Q1 to Qn corresponding to the basis of U/(JAU + U JA) as (kQ0, kQ0)-bimodules.
In view of Lemma 9.5, these vertices and arrows are precisely the ones described in (a) and (b), hence the
quiver of B is

Q.

Now we determine the relations. To simplify the discussion below, we give a grading on B in Theorem
9.1 by setting the ﬁrst factor to have degree 0, and the second one to have degree 1. Similarly, give a
Q by setting the arrows in (i) to have degree 0, and in (ii), (iii) to have degree 1. Take a subset

We look at the most special case d = 1 and n = 1.

Example 9.6. Let Q be a ﬁnite connected acyclic non-Dynkin quiver and kQ its path algebra, which is
1-representation-inﬁnite.

The 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B = kQ ⊕ U with U = τ −1kQ is a truncation of the preprojective
algebra Π of Q, which is presented by the same quiver as Π and the additional relations ‘the elements of U
square to zero’, as stated in Proposition 9.4.

The equivalence Dsg(B) ≃ C2(kQ) in Corollary 9.3 is given in [BIRS, ART] as the 2-CY category associated
to the square of the Coxeter element in the Coxeter group of Q. Our proof is diﬀerent from theirs since our
equivalence comes from quasi-equivalence of DG orbit categories.

The next example is the case d = 1 and n = 2.

This is a higher dimensional analogue of Example 9.6 above. It is predicted in [I2] as a generalization

This is a 2-representation inﬁnite algebra. (See [HIO, Theorem 2.10].) This is also the endomorphism algebra

10. Examples: Polynomial rings

In this section, we apply our main results for polynomial rings and give a concrete description of the
d-representation-inﬁnite algebra A and the d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B. (See (8.2) for the deﬁnition of
A and B.)

Let R = k[x0, . . . , xd] with deg xi = −ai < 0.

It is bimodule (d + 1)-CY algebra with a-invariant
d
a =
i=0 ai. We have the following result on the algebras A and B. For a ﬁnite subgroup G ⊂ GLd+1(k),
which naturally acts on R, the skew group algebra R ∗ G is a vector space R ⊗k kG with multiplication
(a ⊗ g)(b ⊗ h) = ag(b) ⊗ gh.

full subquiver with vertices {0, 1, . . . , a − 1} and with the induced relations.
(2)(3) We follow the construction of d-representation-inﬁnite algebras of type

A [HIO, Section 5].

Let L be the free Z-module with basis α1, . . . , αd, and set α0 := −α1 − · · · − αd. Let Q be the quiver
i : l → l + αi | l ∈ L, 0 ≤ i ≤ d}. Moreover for each
e
ij = xixj − xj xi. Then we have a category L presented

with vertices Q0 = L and the set of arrows Q1 = {xi = xl
l ∈ L and 0 ≤ i < j ≤ d, deﬁne the relation rij = rl
by this quiver and relations. We assign for each point l =

d
i=1 liαi ∈ L the integer m(l) =

d
i=1 liai.

Now let B ⊂ L the subgroup consisting of points l in L such that m(l) is a multiple of a. The subgroup B
has ﬁnite index a, and acts on L by translation. We then have the orbit category L/B, which can naturally
be identiﬁed with the algebra Π presented by the (ﬁnite) quiver Q/B and the induced relations. By [HIO,
Lemma 5.3], Π is isomorphic to the skew group algebra R ∗ G.

P

P

Going back to the original quiver Q, we set

C = {x : l → l′ in Q1 | m(l) < na ≤ m(l′) for some n ∈ Z},

which is a periodic and bounding cut in the sense of [HIO, Deﬁnitions 5.4, 5.5], and is stable under B. Then
C induces a grading on Q/B, hence on Π by

deg x =

1 (x ∈ C)
0 (x 6∈ C)

(

for each x ∈ Q1. Now by [HIO, Theorem 5.6], Π is the preprojective algebra of its degree 0 part, and we
see that it is nothing but A, since they are presented by the quiver (Q/B) \ (C/B) and the commutativity
relations.
(4) We ﬁrst compute the quiver of B using Lemma 8.7(3). Since R is generated by degree > −a, the vector
space on the lower left corner of U/(JAU + U JA) is 0. Therefore the arrows we have to add are just the
Q. Then there exists a natural homomorphism
ones corresponding to 1 ∈ R0/J0 = k, and the quiver of B is
k
Q/I → B, where I is the ideal
generated by the relations. We show that ϕ is an isomorphism. We may truncate by the idempotents; denote
Q/I)ei → ejBei is an
by ei the idempotent of k
isomorphism for each 0 ≤ i, j ≤ a − 1. Note that the relations show that each space ej(k
Q/I)ei has a basis
consisting of monomials of degree −(j − i + 1) (deﬁned from the grading on R) each of which contains at
most one of the ul’s (which have degree 0). It is then clear that ϕ maps these basis to the basis of ejBei. (cid:3)

Q → B, which preserves the relations, thus induces a homomorphism ϕ : k

Q/I at vertex i, and we show that the induced map ej(k

Let us ﬁrst look at the easiest case.

Example 10.2. This is a continuation of Example 4.8. Let R = k[x, y] with deg x = deg y = −1, so R
is 2-CY of a-invariant 2. By Theorem 5.2, Rdg is twisted 4-CY. As we have seen in Example 4.8, we have
an equivalence Db(qgr R) ≃ Db(mod A) with A the Kronecker algebra, and its AR translation ν1 has a
square root. On the other hand, the Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B is presented by the following quiver with
relations:

We look at higher dimensional case.

Example 10.3. Let R = k[x0, x1, . . . , xd] with deg x0 = · · · = deg xd = −1. Then R is (d + 1)-CY of
a-invariant d + 1, thus by Theorem 5.2, Rdg is sign-twisted (2d + 2)-CY. It is well-known that qgr R is

11. Examples: Jacobian algebras arising from dimer models

A dimer model is a ﬁnite bipartite graph Γ on a real 2-torus inducing a polygonal cell decomposition. We
denote by Γ0, (resp. Γ1, Γ2) the set of vertices (resp. edges, faces) of Γ. It gives rise to a quiver with potential
(Q, W ) in the sense of [DWZ] in the following way: Let Q denote the dual quiver of Γ, thus the set of vertices
Q0 (resp. arrows Q1) corresponds bijectively to Γ2 (resp. Γ1). By convention, the arrows of Q see white
vertices on the right. Then for each vertex v there is a unique cycle cv consisting of arrows of Q corresponding
to the edges of Γ which are adjacent to v. Now deﬁne the potential by W =

We assume that Γ is consistent (see [Boc2]) in the sense that there exists a map R : Γ1 → R>0 such that

v : white cv −

v : black cv.

v∈∂a R(a) = 2 for all v ∈ Γ0, where the sum runs over a ∈ Γ1 adjacent to v.
a∈∂f (1 − R(a)) = 2 for all f ∈ Γ2, where the sum runs over a ∈ Γ1 in the boundary of f .

P

P

v∈∂a d(a) is a constant l for all v ∈ Γ0. Such maps are typically given by perfect matchings
such that
on Γ. Recall that a perfect matching on a graph is a set of its edges such that each vertex is contained in
precisely one edge in the set. It is known that the consistency condition ensures the existence of perfect
matchings [Bro, Section 2.3]. We can identify a perfect matching P on Γ with a map d : Γ1 → {0, 1} such
v∈∂a d(a) = 1 for all v ∈ Γ0 by setting d(a) = 1 if and only if a ∈ P . Consequently, any Z-linear
that
combination of perfect matchings gives a function (11.1).

P

Proposition 11.1 (See [Bro, Theorem 7.7], [AIR, Proposition 6.1]). Let Γ be a consistent dimer model,
v∈∂a d(a) = l for all v ∈ Γ0. Then d gives a grading on the Jacobian

Proof. Give a grading on the quiver Q by setting deg a = d(a) for a ∈ Q1. Then the potential W is
homogeneous of degree l, thus d induces a grading on the Jacobian algebra R. Consider the complex

(1) First we consider the grading below. The labels on the edges show the values under d, and unlabeled
ones have degree 0, thus it is a perfect matching. This grading makes R into a bimodule 3-CY algebra of

This 2-representation inﬁnite algebra A is the endomorphism ring of a tilting bundle T on the Hirzeburch
surface Σ1 = P(OP1 ⊕OP1(−1)) which is the blow-up of P2 at one point as well. Also, R is the 3-preprojective
algebra of A, which is the endomorphism ring of a tilting bundle π∗T on the total space of the canonical
bundle π : ω → Σ1 over Σ1 (see [BH]). Now the DG algebra Rdg is 4-CY by Theorem 5.2, and applying

Appendix A. Multiplying gradings

Let R be a graded ring. For a ﬁxed integer n ≥ 1, deﬁne the graded ring nR by

(nR)i =

Ri/n
0

(

if n | i
if n 6 | i

.

If R is bimodule (d + 1)-CY of a-invariant a, then clearly nR is bimodule (d + 1)-CY of a-invariant na.
Although the category qperZnR just splits as a direct product of n copies of qperZR and yields nothing
new, the cluster category C(nRdg), being a triangulated hull of qperZnR/(−1)[1], becomes ‘connected’ by the
action of the automorphism (−1)[1], which yields something new.

The aim of this section is to describe the category C(nRdg) in terms of the relevant objects from R.
Although this can be regarded as a special case of our main results, we shall obtain a better presentation of
orbit categories.

Recall that R is a negatively graded bimodule (d + 1)-CY algebra of a-invariant a such that each Ri is
ﬁnite dimensional, and recall the deﬁnitions of the d-representation inﬁnite algebra A = A(R), the cotilting
bimodule U = U (R), and the d-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra B = B(R) from (8.2). We have the following
description of C(nRdg) in terms of A, which generalizes Theorem 6.1 and Corollary 6.2.

Theorem A.1. There exists a fully faithful functor

Db(mod A)/ν−1/a

d

[n] = qperZR/(−1)[n]

Proof. Let P1 → P0 → X → 0 be a ﬁnite presentation of X and consider its truncation (−)>i. Since the

Proof of Theorem B.2. Since R is right graded coherent the small derived category Db(mod
R) identiﬁes
with the thick subcategory of D whose cohomology is bounded and each one is ﬁnitely presented. Let
R) and consider the truncation triangle X ′ → X → X ′′ → X ′[1] in D. Since X has bounded
X ∈ Db(mod
cohomology, so do X ′ and X ′′ by Lemma 3.5(1). Moreover, since each H iX is ﬁnitely presented, so are
H iX ′ and H iX ′′ by Lemma 3.5(2) and Lemma B.1. Therefore the t-structure in the big derived category
(cid:3)
restricts to that of the small one, which is precisely (t≤0, t≥0).

Z

B.2. The second proof. We turn to the second direct proof. In this subsection we will use D for the small
Z
derived category Db(mod
R). We need several lemmas for the proof. Put, as usual, t≤n = t≤0[−n] and
t≥n = t≥0[−n]. The ﬁrst one is obvious.

Proposition B.3. We have t≤−1 ⊂ t≤0 and t≥1 ⊂ t≥0.

The following easy observations will be useful.

Lemma B.4. Let A be an abelian category with enough projectives P. Let P ∈ K−(P), X ∈ Db(A) and
suppose that HomA(P i, H i(X)) = 0 for all i ∈ Z. Then HomD(A)(P, X) = 0.

Proof. We may assume by induction on the length of X that X ∈ A. Then we have HomD(A)(P, X) =
(cid:3)
HomK(A)(P, X) և HomC(A)(P, X) ⊂ HomA(P 0, X) = 0.

Lemma B.5. Let X ∈ t≤0. Then there exists a projective resolution P → X such that each term P i ∈
add R(≥ i) for each i ∈ Z.

Proof. This can be seen by recalling the construction of a projective resolution: Suppose we have constructed
such P for degree ≥ n. As in the diagram below, let B = Ker(P n → C), A the pull-back, and P n−1 → A a
surjection from a projective.

Then B ∈ mod≤−n R since it is a subset of P n and P n ∈ add R(≥ n). Also, since there exists an exact
sequence 0 → H n−1(X) → A → B → 0 and H n−1(X) ∈ mod≤−n+1 R by X ∈ t≤0, we have A ∈ mod≤−n+1.

Therefore we can take its projective cover P n−1 ∈ add R(≥ n − 1).

These observations yield the following.

Proposition B.6. We have HomD(X, Y ) = 0 for all X ∈ t≤0 and Y ∈ t≥1.

Proof. Take a projective resolution P → X in Lemma B.5. On the other hand, we have H i(Y ) ∈ mod>−i R
(cid:3)
for each i ∈ Z. Therefore we deduce HomD(X, Y ) = HomD(P, Y ) = 0 by Lemma B.4.

We now give a ﬁnal observation.

Proposition B.7. For any X ∈ D, there exists a triangle X ′ → X → X ′′ → X ′[1] in D with X ′ ∈ t≤0 and
X ′′ ∈ t≥1.

Proof. We proceed by induction on w(X) = max{i ∈ Z | H i(X) 6= 0} − min{i ∈ Z | H i(X) 6= 0}.

If w(X) > 0, there exists n ∈ Z such that in the truncation X ≤n → X → X >n → X ≤n[1] of X
with respect to (the shift of) the standard t-structure (D≤n, D≥n), one has w(Y ), w(Z) < w(X), where

Y := X ≤n and Z := X >n. By induction hypothesis, there exist triangles Y ′ → Y → Y ′′ → Y ′[1] and
Z ′ → Z → Z ′′ → Z ′[1] such that Y ′, Z ′ ∈ t≤0 and Y ′′, Z ′′ ∈ t≥1, thus the diagram below.

We claim that HomD(Z ′[−1], Y ′′) = 0. This allows us to complete the morphism Z[−1] → Y to a
morphism of triangles as in the dashed line above, thus the diagram above to a 3 × 3 diagram of triangles
by [BBD, Proposition 1.1.11]. We then have a triangle X ′ → X → X ′′ → X ′[1] in the third row, which is a
desired one since the ﬁrst and the third column are triangles and t≤0 and t≥0 are extension-closed.

We now prove the claim. Observe that any triangle W ′ → W → W ′′ → W ′[1] in D with W ′ ∈ t≤0 and

W ′′ ∈ t≥1 yields a short exact sequence

R for all i ∈ Z. Indeed, we have H i−1(W ′′) ∈ mod>−i+1 R by W ′′ ∈ t≥1 and H i(W ′) ∈ mod≤−i R
in mod
by W ′ ∈ t≤0, thus the connecting homomorphisms are 0. In particular, W ′, W ′′ ∈ D≤n (resp. ∈ D≥n) if
and only if W ∈ D≤n (resp. ∈ D≥n).

Now apply the above argument to Z ′ → Z → Z ′′ → Z ′[1], which shows Z ′ ∈ D≥n+1, hence Z ′[−1] ∈
t≤1 ∩ D≥n+2. Therefore H i(Z ′[−1]) ∈ mod≤−n−1 R for all i ∈ Z since it is 0 for i ≤ n + 1 and is in
mod≤−i+1 R for i ≥ n + 2. Similarly, we have H i(Y ′′) ∈ mod≥−n+1 R for all i since Y ′′ ∈ D≤n ∩ t≥1. We
(cid:3)
therefore obtain the claim.

Now Theorem B.2 is a consequence of the Propositions.

Appendix C. Proof of Proposition 4.6

In this section we give a proof of Minamoto–Mori’s equivalence [MM] based on Theorem 4.4. The main

tool is the realization of the Verdier quotient as a subcategory given in Theorem 4.4(2).

We need the following computation of morphism in qperZR which is not covered by Theorem 4.4(2).

First complete s to a triangle Z → X s−→ L → Z[1] and consider the truncation L≤0 → L → L>0 → L≤0[1]
with respect to the standart t-structure. Since HomperZR(X, L>0) = 0 there is a map X → L≤0 and as in the
left diagram above, the original moprhism equals the morphism X s
←− Z ′ → Z → Y [l] with cone s′ = L≤0
concentrated in (cohomological) degree ≤ 0.

′

Next consider the truncation of M := L≤0 along the standard t-structure: M <0 → M → H 0M →
M <0[1]. By the octahedral axiom we ﬁnd a commutative diagram in the above right. Now we have
HomperZR(M <0[−1], Y [l]) = 0, the morphism Z ′ → Y factors through Z ′′. Then the diagram X s
←− Z ′ −→
Z
R gives the same morphism in qperZR as the original one, which establishes
Y [l] with cone s′′ = H 0M ∈ ﬂ
our claim.

Now let X → Y [l] be a morphism in qperZR presented by the diagram X s←− Z −→ Y [l] in per R with
R. Since HomperZR(L[−1], Y [l]) = 0 by the assumption on Y , the map Z → Y [l] factors
(cid:3)

Z
L := cone s ∈ ﬂ
through s, hence we have HomqperZR(X, Y [l]) և HomperZR(X, Y [l]) = 0.

′′

Now we are ready to give our proof.

Proof of Proposition 4.6. (1) We ﬁrst show the vanishing of extensions, that is, HomqperZR(T, T [i]) = 0 for
all i 6= 0. The case i < 0 follows from Lemma C.1. Also, when i > d we have HomqperZR(T, T [i]) =
D HomqperZR(T, T (a)[d − i]) by Serre duality, thus 0 again by Lemma C.1. Therefore it remains to consider
the case 0 ≤ i ≤ d. Note that in perZR, we have R(l) = (R(l)[−l])[l] ∈ M[l], thus T ∈ M ∗ · · · ∗ M[a − 1].
Therefore, T [i] lies in the fundamental domain M ∗ · · · ∗ M[d + a − 1] for all 0 ≤ i ≤ d. This shows
HomqperZR(T, T [i]) = HomperZR(T, T [i]) = 0 for 0 < i ≤ d. We next show that T generates qperZR.
Consider the minimal projective resolution 0 → Pd+1 → · · · → P0 → R0 → 0 of the graded R-module
R0. We know that P0 = R. Since R is twisted (d + 1)-CY of a-invariant a, we see that Pd+1 = R(a) and
Pi ∈ add{R(l) | 0 < l < a} for all 0 < i < d + 1. (See the proofs of [MM, Proposition 4.3] or [AIR, Lemma
3.8].) Therefore R(a) ∈ thick T in qperZR and we see inductively that T generates qperZR.
(2) We deduce by (1) that there exists a triangle equivalence qperZR ≃ Db(mod A). Comparing the Serre
functor of each category, we have (−)α(a)[d] ↔ ν := − ⊗L

A DA, thus (−)α(a) ↔ νd := − ⊗L
A DA[−d].
d A ∈ mod A for all i ≥ 0. For this we have to show HomDb(mod A)(A, ν−i
d A[l]) = 0 for all
l 6= 0 and i ≥ 0. By the triangle equivalence, this is to show HomqperZR(T, T (−ia)[l]) = 0 since Rα ≃ R, or
HomqperZR(T (ia), T [l]) = 0. By Lemma C.1 and the Serre duality we may assume 0 < l ≤ d. To prove this
we apply Theorem 4.4(2). Note that T (ia) ∈ M ∗ · · · for all i ≥ 0 and T [l] ∈ · · · ∗ M[d + a − 1] for all l ≤ d.
By Theorem 4.4(2), we deduce HomqperZR(T (ia), T [l]) = HomperZR(T (ia), T [l]), which is zero for l 6= 0.

We ﬁrst show ν−i

Finally, we prove gl. dim A ≤ d. Since gl. dim A is certainly ﬁnite, it is suﬃcient to show Extl
A (DA, A) = HomDb(A)(νA, A[d + i]) = HomDb(A)(A, ν−1

for l > d. For any i > 0, we have Extd+i
is 0 by the previous claim.

A(DA, A) = 0

Appendix D. On silting-cluster tilting correspondence

Throughout this appendix, let d be a positive integer, and let Γ be a bimodule (d + 1)-CY DG algebra
over a ﬁeld k such that H iΓ = 0 for all i > 0 and H 0Γ is ﬁnite dimensional. Amiot [Am] and Guo [Gu]
introduced the cluster category as

C(Γ) := per Γ/Db(Γ).

Then Γ is a silting object in per Γ and a d-cluster tilting object in C(Γ) [Am, Theorem 2.1][Gu, Theorem 2.2];
see Theorem 2.6. More generally, the functor per Γ → C(Γ) sends each silting objet in per Γ to a d-cluster
tilting object in C(Γ) [IYa1, Corollary 5.12]. Therefore we have a map

(D.1)

silt Γ

/ d-ctilt Γ ,

where silt Γ (resp. d-ctilt Γ) is the set of isomorphism classes of silting objects in per Γ (resp. d-cluster tilting
objects in C(Γ)). The aim of this appendix is to discuss the following problem.

Question D.1. How far is the map (D.1) being from bijective?

/
CLUSTER CATEGORIES AND SINGULARITY CATEGORIES

35

A natural approach to study this question is to consider the full subcategory (called the fundamental

domain)

F = P ∗ P[1] ∗ · · · ∗ P[d − 1] ⊂ per Γ,
where P = add Γ ⊂ per Γ. Then the composition F ⊂ per Γ → C(Γ) is an additive equivalence (see Theorem
2.6). In particular the map (D.1) restricts to an injection

(D.2)
where siltF Γ is the subset of silt Γ consisting of silting objects contained in F .

/ d-ctilt Γ ,

siltF Γ(cid:31)

Deﬁnition D.2. We call Γ mild if the map (D.2) is bijective.

For d = 1 and 2, Γ is always mild [KN] (see also [IYa1, Corollary 5.12]). It was asked in [IYa1, Conjecture
In fact, under the

5.14] if Γ is always mild for d ≥ 3. We will show that this is far from being true.
assumption that H 0Γ = k, we will characterize mildness as follows.

Theorem D.3. Let Γ be a (d + 1)-Calabi-Yau DG k-algebra such that H iΓ = 0 for i > 0 and H 0Γ = k.
Then the following are equivalent.

(a) Γ is mild.
(b) d-ctilt Γ = {Γ, . . . , Γ[d − 1]}.
(c) Γ is quasi-isomorphic to k[x] with deg x = −d and with zero diﬀerentials.
(d) C(Γ) is triangle equivalent to Cd(k), the d-cluster category of k.

Proof. (a)⇔(b) Since H 0Γ = k, Γ is an indecomposable silting object in per Γ, thus silt Γ = {Γ[i] | i ∈ Z}.
Then siltF Γ = {Γ[i] | 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1} and the desired equivalence follows.
(b)⇒(c) We ﬁrst show that Γ is d-periodic in C(Γ), that is, Γ ≃ Γ[d] in C(Γ). Suppose that d-ctilt Γ =
{Γ[i] | 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1}. Then the d-cluster tilting object Γ[d] ∈ C(Γ) has to be isomorphic to Γ[i] for some
0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1. The only possible i is 0 since HomC(Γ)(Γ, Γ[i]) = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1. Thus we have Γ ≃ Γ[d]
in C(Γ).
We next compute the cohomology of Γ. By Theorem 2.6(2) the functor per Γ → C(Γ) induces bijections
Homper Γ(Γ[i], Γ) → HomC(Γ)(Γ[i], Γ) for each i ≥ 0, thus H −iΓ = HomC(Γ)(Γ[i], Γ) for i ≥ 0. By periodicity
of Γ, this is k if i | d, and 0 if i 6 | d since HomC(Γ)(Γ, Γ[i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d. Now lift an isomorphism
Γ[d] → Γ in C(Γ) to a morphism f : Γ[d] → Γ in per Γ, and let y ∈ Z −dΓ give the morphism f in H −dΓ. Then
we obtain a homomorphism k[x] → Γ of DG algebras, taking x to y. Consider the power yn ∈ Z ndΓ of y.

It presents the morphism Γ[nd]
in C(Γ). Therefore yn is non-zero in H −ndΓ. We conclude that k[x] → Γ is a quasi-isomorphism.
(c)⇒(d) Since k[x] with deg x = −d is the derived (d + 1)-preprojective algebra of k, the assertion follows.
(cid:3)
(d)⇒(b) If C(Γ) ≃ Cd(k) then clearly d-ctilt Γ = {Γ[i] | 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 1}.

f

Example D.4. We regard the polynomial ring Γ = k[x1, . . . , xn] as a DG algebra with deg xi = −ai < 0
n
and zero diﬀerential. We assume that a =
i=1 ai is odd. Then Γ is an (n + a)-CY DG algebra by Theorem
5.2. By (c) of the above theorem we immdediately deduce the following.

Corollary D.5. Γ is mild if and only if n = 1.
