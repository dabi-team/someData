Abstract.  A  new  configuration  for  observation  of  magneto-optical  subnatural-linewidth 
resonances of electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) in alkali vapor has been verified 
experimentally. The configuration includes using two counter-propagating pump and probe 
light waves with mutually orthogonal linear polarizations, exciting an open optical transition 
of  an  alkali  atom  in  the  presence  of  a  buffer  gas.  The  main  advantage  of  the  novel 
observation scheme consists in the possibility of obtaining simultaneously high-contrast and 
quite  narrow  nonlinear  signals.  Here  a  2.5-cm  long  rubidium-87  vapor  cell  filled  with  Ar 
buffer  gas  is  used,  and  the excited  optical  transition  is  the Fg=2→Fe=1 of  the  D1  line.  The 
signals  registered  reach  a  contrast  of  57.7%  with  a  FWHM  of  7.2  mG.  The  contrast  with 
respect to a wide Doppler pedestal well exceeds 100%. To our knowledge, to date this is the 
best  result  for  EIA  resonances  in  terms  of  contrast-to-width  ratio.  In  general,  the  results 
demonstrate  that  the  new  magneto-optical  scheme  has  very  good  prospects  for  various 
applications in quantum metrology, nonlinear optics and photonics.

The quantum  principles  which  form  the  basis of  the 
operation of various quantum sensors yield remarkable 
advantages  of  these  devices  as  compared  with  their 
classical  counterparts.  One  of  these  key  principles  is 
based  on  the  concept  of  coherent  interaction  between 
the  electromagnetic  fields  and  matter.  This  interaction 
can put matter  into a special  non-classical state, which 
can be used for accurate sensing of the physical fields, for 
precise  control  of  light  waves  and  other  relevant 
applications. Therefore, this scientific direction attracts a 
great interest nowadays. 

One  of  the  most  interesting  technologies  for  the 
development of quantum sensors and optical controlling 
elements  exploits  the  coherent  population  trapping 
phenomenon  (CPT)  [1,2].  For  instance,  many  authors 
propose using CPT for sensing weak magnetic fields for 
medicine, biology and fundamental science (e.g., see [3–
5]). CPT and related nonlinear effects can be also used to 

produce  sensitive  and  compact  optical  switches  and 
optical  delay  lines  [6–9],  which  can  be  of  principal 
importance  for  optical  communications  and  quantum 
informatics. All-optical compact and chip-scale CPT atom 
clocks [10–12] can be also treated as quantum sensors of 
a microwave frequency. 

In  laser  spectroscopy,  the  CPT  regularly  manifests 
itself  as  a  steep  decrease 
in  the  atomic  vapor 
fluorescence  or,  equivalently,  a  steep  increase  in  the 
transparency of the atomic vapor. This nonlinear effect is 
called  electromagnetically  induced  transparency  (EIT) 
[13].  The  EIT  is  the  operating  principle  of  many 
technologies  involved  CPT.  One  of  the  most  attractive 
features  of  the  EIT  resonances  consists  in  their 
subnatural linewidth,  which  can be very narrow (from 
several  hundreds  of  kHz  and  down  to  units  of  Hz) 
[14,15]. Also, a high EIT signal contrast of several to tens

field.  Narrow  EIA  resonances  at  an 
unprecedented  contrast  up  to  60%  were  obtained. 
However,  the  narrowest  EIA  signal  observed  in  the 
paper had a width of about 66 kHz at a contrast of about 
10%. Unfortunately,  the higher  contrast was  measured 
for larger signal widths. 

Summing  up  the  aforesaid,  we  can  state  that  the 
problem  of  obtaining  a  sufficiently  large  contrast-to-
width  ratio  of  EIA  resonances  has  not  been  solved  yet 
(with respect to real experiments). At the same time, it 
should be emphasized that the successful solution of this 
problem will promote  the EIA resonances use in many 
directions of  modern quantum  technologies where  EIT 
effect is actively involved at present. 

In our previous work [39] we proposed to exploit two 
counter-propagating 
laser  beams  with  mutually 
orthogonal linear polarizations to excite an open optical 
transition  in  an  alkali-metal  atom  (Rb  or  Cs)  for 
obtaining  a  high-quality  (meaning  high-contrast  and 
narrow-linewidth)  magneto-optical  EIA  signal.  The 
proposed scheme of excitation allows one to use buffer 
gas  to  greatly  improve  the  properties  of  the  nonlinear 
resonances. Note that many other schemes do not allow 
using  buffer  gas  to  enhance  the  EIA  resonance  quality 
due  to  the  rapid  destruction  of  the  excited  state 
anisotropy. Still, no experimental verification of the new 
scheme or an in-depth theoretical description have been 
demonstrated.  Here  we  partly  eliminate  this  lack  of 
knowledge and show the results of our experiments.  

The  experimental  setup  is  schematically  depicted  in 
Fig, 2. The cell used contains isotopically enriched  87Rb 
vapor  and  around  12  Torr  of  Ar  buffer  gas.  It  has  a 
cylindrical  shape  with  length  25  mm  and  diameter  25 
mm.  The  cell  was  irradiated  by  means  of  a  DFB  laser 
whose output light was split into two beams forming the 
counter-propagating  pump  and  probe  light  fields.  The 
laser frequency was locked to the center of the Doppler 
profile of the probe-wave absorption at the Fg=2→Fe=1 
optical transition of the D1 line. Magnetic field parallel to 
the laser beam propagation direction was produced by 
means of a solenoid and its value was scanned around 
zero value, yielding resonances of EIA. The experiments 
were carried out  at 50oC  temperature of  the  cell  walls. 
The  cell  was  heated  by  means  of  a  special 
thermochamber  made  of  copper.  The  laser  beam 
diameter in the cell was around 5 mm. The probe-wave 
power was fixed to 3.5 W, measured after the cell when 
the  laser  radiation  was  far  from  the  one-photon 
resonance  condition.  A  three-layer  -metal  magnetic 
shielding  was  used  to  decrease  the  influence  of  stray 
magnetic fields.

percent  has  been  observed  by  many  authors  (e.g.,  see 
[16–23]). 

The  effect  of  electromagnetically  induced  absorption 
(EIA)  was  discovered  about  20  years  ago  [24]  and 
spectroscopically it looks as an opposite effect to the EIT. 
The EIA resonance manifests itself as a steep decrease in 
the cell transparency (see the example in Fig.1). Since its 
observation,  the  EIA  effect  has  also  found  applications, 
like four-wave mixing [25], “fast” light experiments [26], 
magnetic field mapping of cold atomic samples [27]; still, 
until now it has not attracted as much attention as the 
EIT phenomenon. The main reason that seriously limits 
the area of EIA use, consists in the problem of obtaining a 
high-contrast and at  the  same  time sufficiently  narrow 
nonlinear  resonance.  Indeed,  there  are  a  lot  of  papers 
demonstrating  a  relatively  good  contrast  of  the  EIA 
signals,  but  this  is  at  the  expense  of  large  widths  (for 
instance, see [28–33]). And, vice versa, the width can be 
as small as 10 kHz down to just several hundreds of Hz, 
but, unfortunately, these signals have an extremely low 
contrast  (~  1  %)  [34–36].  In  work  [18]    EIA  and  EIT 
signals were observed for various atomic transitions in 
cesium and it can be seen that the EIA resonances have 
much lower contrast in comparison with the EIT signals. 
The  first  experiments  on  the  EIA  effect  in  a  two-
frequency and in the so called Hanle configurations also 
did not demonstrate  any  good  contrast-to-width  ratios 
[24,37]. 

Recently, 

interesting  results  were  obtained 

in 
potassium atoms in a cell with antirelaxation coating of 
the  walls  [38].  The  authors  used  an  observation 
configuration  consisting  of  two  counter-propagating 
circularly  polarized  laser  beams  and  a  transverse

≈ 795 nm and 1 MHz spectral bandwidth, OI – Faraday optical isolator, PM fiber – optical polarization-maintaining fiber, 
PBS – polarizing beam splitter, PD – photodetector, PM – power meter. 

Fig.  3  shows  the  power  broadening  of  the  EIA 
resonance. It is seen that a FWHM as low as ≈ 2 mG was 
obtained.  The  value  of  the  width  at  low  pump-wave 
power levels can be affected and limited by power of the 
probe  beam  as  well  as  the  stray  transverse  magnetic 
field. The figure also contains the corresponding values 
of the Zeeman shift of the magnetic sublevels, which can 
be calculated using the formula: ≈0.73×B with  being 
the  Larmor  frequency  (kHz)  and  B  –  the  longitudinal 
magnetic field (mG). Therefore, a width as low as ≈ 1.5 
kHz can be achieved. 

There  are  several  ways  to  define  the  contrast  of  a 
nonlinear  resonance  in  the  transmitted  signal.  For 
example, we can define it as the ratio between the EIA 
amplitude (A) and the total absorbed probe-wave power 
(Pabs) in the cell:

See  also  the  Fig.1.  Here  Pin  is  the  power  of  the  probe 
beam when it  is  out  of  the  one-photon resonance  with 
the  atoms,  while  P0  is  the  output  probe  power  at  the 
center of the resonance. Transmission coefficient can be 
introduced as T=Pout/Pin. Then Tback in (1) is responsible 
for  the  level  of  the  wide  background  (≈ 0.85  in Fig. 1). 
For  instance,  the  same  definition  of  the  contrast  was 
used  in  [38].  Fig.  4(a)  reveals  the  square-root-like 
dependence of the contrast on the pump-beam power. In 
particular, 57.7% contrast corresponds to 7.2 mG width. 
This combination of contrast and width is quite good for 
EIA-type of subnatural-linewidth resonances. Moreover, 
we  expect  that  a  contrast  of  70%  and  higher  can  be 
achieved  by  further  increasing  the  pump  power  (our 
setup was limited at 390 W pump-wave power). 

However,  in  the  majority  of  works  the  contrast 
implies  just  a  ratio  between  the  EIA  amplitude  and 
amplitude of a wide pedestal, which suffers Doppler and 
buffer-gas  collisional  broadening  (see  [22,23,40],  for 
example). In this case we have:

It  is  worth  noting  that  in  our  scheme  Crel  can  be 
dramatically  high  (see  Fig,  4(b)).  In  principle,  it  can 
exceed  100%,  since  the  wide  background  amplitude 
decreases  with  pump  power  increase  (1/P).  This 
happens  mainly  because  of  the  openness  of  the 
transition,  as  more  atoms  are  pumped  onto  the  non-
resonant  hyperfine  level  (Fg=1  in  our  case)  when  the

power is increased. This leads to a low absorption at the 
“wings”  of  the  profile  (see  Fig.  1).  The  behavior  of  the 
resonance center is more complicated and it depends on 
several  factors.  In  the  simplest  case  when  the  stray 
transverse magnetic field is negligibly small, the atoms at 
the resonance center (B≈0) tend to stay on the Fg=2 level 
long time due to the CPT phenomenon, since they almost 
do not absorb the pump light (the probe beam power is 
too  small  to  destroy  or  influence  significantly  the  CPT 
state). Therefore, when the pump power increases, the 
background level of absorption decreases more rapidly 
than the level of probe-wave absorption at the center of 
the resonance, leading to ultrahigh value of the relative 
contrast. Of course, the existence of stray magnetic fields 
influences  the  CPT  state  created  by  the  pump  wave at 
B=0 and thus, the EIA contrast and width. Therefore, a 
high-quality  magnetic  shielding  is  quite  necessary  in 
order  to  obtain  high-quality  magneto-optical  EIA 
resonances. 

observing  EIA  signals,  the  openness  plays  a  very 
destructive  role  and  prevents  obtaining  high  contrasts 
(e.g.,  see  [40–42]).  However,  for  our  scheme  the 
openness  of  the  transition  is  quite  important  for 
observing a high contrast. 

The  EIA  contrast  can  reach  really  high  values.  To 
demonstrate  this,  we  have  performed  numerical 
calculations based on the optical Bloch equations for the 
density matrix elements. Fig, 5 shows a contrast of about 
90%  can  be  obtained  at  relatively  low  pump  beam 
power.  It  is  also  seen  that  the  relative  contrast  can  be 
equal  to  several  hundreds  of  percent.  The  latter 
demonstrates  a  unique  possibility  for  observing  the 
probe-wave  absorption  profile  composed  of  only 
subnatural-linewidth  resonance,  i.e.  without  any  other 
broader structure as a pedestal. This is a feature of the 
EIA  effect  in  our  scheme  of  observation,  even  in 
comparison  with  the  EIT  resonances,  which  are 
subnatural-width  structures  superimposed  on  a  broad 
background profile. Deviations of the theoretical values 
in  Fig.  5  from  the  experimental  ones  (Fig.  4)  can  be 
explained by influence of the stray transverse magnetic 
field.
