Abstract
We present the results obtained by analyzing high spatial and spectral resolution
data of the solar photosphere acquired by the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter
at the Swedish Solar Telescope on 6 August 2011, relevant to a large sunspot
with a light bridge (LB) observed in NOAA AR 11263. These data are comple-
mented by simultaneous Hinode Spectropolarimeter (SP) observation in the Fe
I 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm lines. The continuum intensity map shows a discon-
tinuity of the radial distribution of the penumbral ﬁlaments in correspondence
with the LB, which shows a dark lane (about 0.3” wide and about 8.0” long)
along its main axis. The available data were inverted with the Stokes Inversion
based on Response functions (SIR) code and physical parameters maps were
obtained. The line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the plasma along the LB derived

from the Doppler eﬀect shows motions towards and away from the observer
up to 0.6 km/s, which are lower in value than the LOS velocities observed in
the neighbouring penumbral ﬁlaments. The noteworthy result is that we ﬁnd
motions toward the observer up to 0.6 km/s in the dark lane where the LB is
located between two umbral cores, while the LOS velocity motion toward the
observer is strongly reduced where the LB is located between an umbral core
at one side and penumbral ﬁlaments on the other side. Statistically, the LOS
velocities correspond to upﬂows/downﬂows and comparing these results with
Hinode/SP data, we conclude that the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration
(whether more or less inclined) could have a role in maintaining the conditions
for the process of plasma piling up along the dark lane. The results obtained
from our study support and conﬁrm outcomes of recent magnetohydro-dynamic
simulations showing upﬂows along the main axis of a LBs.

1. Introduction

In recent years, our understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the
formation and evolution of sunspots has been greatly improved thanks to high
temporal-, spatial- and spectral-resolution polarimetric data. These observations
have unveiled some physical properties of several ﬁne structures of the sunspots
(Thomas and Weiss, 2004; Borrero and Ichimoto, 2011; Rempel and Schlichen-
maier, 2011) such as umbral dots (inside the umbra), dark-core ﬁlaments (in the
penumbra) and light bridges (LBs, separating some umbral portions).

The study of the LBs plays an important role for understanding the grower
and decay phases of sunspots. LBs are bright and elongated structures delineat-
ing the border between dark umbral cores. In some cases they form during the
coalescence of sunspots, while in other cases they are evidence of re-establishment
of granular motions within the spot, and often indicate the beginning of spot
fragmentation (Vazquez, 1973). Moreover, before the formation of a LB, several
umbral dots emerge in the location where a LB will be formed, and the LB
structure rapidly intrudes from the leading edge of penumbral ﬁlaments into the
umbra (Katsukawa et al., 2007).

According to Thomas and Weiss (2004), there are two types of LBs: ones
segmented along their length, with bright segments resembling tiny granules sep-
arated by narrow dark lanes oriented perpendicular to the axis of the LB (Berger
and Berdyugina, 2003); and others, which are unsegmented, and, according to
Lites et al. (2004), resemble the elongated features seen in the penumbra. More-
over, LBs are classiﬁed as faint light bridges (FLBs), which are narrow bright
features inside the umbra, and as strong light bridges (SLBs), separating diﬀerent
umbral fragments (Sobotka, Bonet, and Vazquez, 1994). LBs often exhibit a
granular morphology, even if the size, lifetime, and brightness of these granules
are diﬀerent from those found in the granulation of the quiet photosphere. In
particular, the granular structures forming SLBs are generally smaller than the

SOLA: manuscript.tex; 2 October 2018; 12:36; p. 2

Kinematics and Magnetic Properties of a Light Bridge in a Decaying Sunspot

ones in the quiet photosphere: the typical sizes being 1.2′′ (Sobotka, Bonet, and
Vazquez, 1994), instead of 1.5′′. The intensity of the LB granules is about 85%
of the mean photospheric intensity. By following the temporal evolution of these
sub-structures during their irregular motions inside the LB, proper motions with
have been detected (Hirzberger et al., 2002). The
velocities up to 1.5 km s
lifetime distribution of these granular features shows a maximum at 5 min and
a second peak at approximately 20 min (Hirzberger et al., 2002).

In LBs the magnetic ﬁelds have a lower strength and are sparser and more
horizontal than in the neighbouring umbrae. LBs with their weak and inclined
ﬁelds therefore represent a discontinuity in the regular umbral ﬁeld (Lites et al.,
1991; Leka, 1997). Recent observations by Jurˇc´ak, Sobotka, and Mart´ınez Pillet
(2005) and Jurˇc´ak, Mart´ınez Pillet, and Sobotka (2006) pointed out an essen-
tially ﬁeld-free region at the deepest visible level of two LBs, but with magnetic
canopies spreading from either sides of the LBs and merging above them.

Many segmented LBs also show a narrow dark lane along their main axis
(Rimmele, 2008). Berger and Berdyugina (2003) showed that this lane has a
typical width that varies from 0.2′′ to 0.5′′: in the larger section the features (the
granules along the sides of the lane) resemble large-scale modiﬁed convection,
while in the smaller sections of the LB, the granules appear increasingly smaller,
until only a central dark lane is observed, probably due to the alignment of
convection cells caused by the magnetic ﬁeld. Often during its lifetime, portions
of the dark lane dissolve and then reform again (Rimmele, 2008).

An analysis of a LB velocity ﬁeld carried out by Rimmele (1997) provided evi-
dence of the presence of sinking plasma in the axial channel. From the correlation
between vertical velocity and continuum intensity in the granules belonging to
a LB, Rimmele (1997) could conﬁrm their convective origin. In this regard, it
is important to ﬁnd out whether the motions observed in LBs have a magneto-
convective origin or are due to convection penetrating from the sub-photospheric
layers into a ﬁeld-free gap (Thomas and Weiss, 2004). Furthermore, this study is
also important to understand the physical processes at the basis of the sunspot
formation. Actually, there are two theoretical models which attempt to de-
scribe the sunspot formation process: the monolithic model (Cowling, 1957)
and the spaghetti-like model (Parker, 1979a,b,c), but according to Rempel and
Schlichenmaier (2011) it seems that the monolithic model is the favoured one.

More recent observations show that in segmented LBs the dark lane is charac-
terized by upﬂows, while in the intergranular lanes of normal granulation we can
see downﬂows (Rouppe van der Voort, Bellot Rubio, and Ortiz, 2010). Therefore,
the process which originates the dark lane seems to be plasma pile-up caused by
the strong decrease of the vertical upﬂow near the surface. The plasma is forced
by the cusp-like surrounding magnetic ﬁeld into a region with enhanced density
and therefore larger opacity (Giordano et al., 2008). This causes the elevation of
the τ = 1 (where τ denotes the optical depth) surface into a cooler, higher part
of the atmosphere resulting in a dark lane in intensity images (Sch¨ussler and
V¨ogler, 2006). Moreover, recent observations have also revealed that some types
of LBs are accompanied by remarkable long-lasting plasma ejections or surge
activities in the chromosphere (Asai, Ishii, and Kurokawa, 2001; Shimizu et al.,

SOLA: manuscript.tex; 2 October 2018; 12:36; p. 3

Falco et al.

2009; Shimizu, 2011; Louis, Beck, and Ichimoto, 2014; Toriumi, Katsukawa, and
Cheung, 2015).

In this paper we provide a further observational contribution to the under-
standing of plasma motions and magnetic ﬁelds in a LB, by using a very high
quality dataset acquired with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter on the 1-
m Swedish Solar Telescope on 6 August 2011, imaging NOAA AR 11263. In
the next section we describe the dataset analysed and the methods applied. In
Section 3 we report our results, in Section 4 we discuss their interpretation, and
in Section 5 we draw our conclusions.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

The active region NOAA AR 11263 was observed on 6 August 2011 at N16W43
(µ = 0.76, which is the value of the cosine of the heliocentric angle θ of the
observations) using the CRisp Imaging Spectropolarimeter (CRISP; Scharmer
et al., 2008) mounted at the 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope (SST; Scharmer et al.,
2003), during a joint observing campaign (HOP 0195) with the Hinode satellite
(Kosugi et al., 2007). The CRISP spectropolarimetric measurements were taken
from 09:53:32 UT to 10:48:43 UT along the Fe I line pair at 630.15 nm and 630.25
nm with 15 spectral points for each line, in steps of 4.4 pm from −26.8 pm to 34.8
pm for 630.15 nm and steps of 4.4 pm from −30.8 pm to 30.8 pm for 630.25 nm
with respect to the line center of each line. Cristaldi et al. (2014) used the same
kind of dataset for a diﬀerent target observed during this observing campaign.
The average cadence of each scan was 28 seconds. Liquid crystals modulated
the light cycling through four polarization states (I, Q, U, and V ) (Schnerr,
de La Cruz Rodr´ıguez, and van Noort, 2011), and 5 exposures per polarization
state were acquired, resulting in a total of 20 exposures per line position. The
pixel size of the CRISP cameras was 0.06′′ pixel−1 at 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm.
The noise level is diﬀerent for each Stokes parameter: 4 × 10−3I/Ic (where Ic is
the mean quiet Sun continuum intensity value) for Stokes Q, 3 × 10−3I/Ic for
Stokes U, and 8 × 10−3I/Ic for Stokes V. The ﬁeld of view (FOV) of these SST
measurements was 57.5′′ × 57.3′′.

Moreover, the dataset acquired by Hinode satellite during the joint observing
campaign was used to obtain information on the magnetic ﬁeld topology of the
AR. The Hinode/SP (Tsuneta et al., 2008; Lites et al., 2013), recorded the Stokes
proﬁles along the Fe I line pair at 630.15 nm and 630.25 nm with a pixel sampling
of 0.317′′ and a noise level of about 10−3I/Ic (fast mode). Level 2 data obtained
from the Milne-Eddington gRid Linear Inversion Network (MERLIN) code (Lites
et al., 2007) were used in our analysis. We applied the non-potential magnetic
ﬁeld calculation technique (NPFC; Georgoulis, 2005) to the inverted dataset
to perform azimuth disambiguation in solar vector magnetograms, obtaining
inclination and azimuthal angle maps in the local solar frame.

To follow the global evolution of the AR and the formation of the LB we
also analyzed continuum images and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms in the
Fe I line at 617.3 nm from 2 to 7 August 2011 taken by the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al., 2012) onboard of the Solar Dynamics

Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012). Both datasets
were characterized by a pixel size of 0.5′′ and a time cadence of 2 hours.

The SST data have been processed using the Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind
Deconvolution (MOMFBD; van Noort, Rouppe van der Voort, and L¨ofdahl,
2005) technique in order to achieve the highest spatial resolution in combina-
tion with the adaptive optics. For the data processing we followed the diﬀer-
ent steps in the CRISPRED reduction pipeline for CRISP data (de la Cruz
Rodr´ıguez et al., 2015). Wideband images, acquired simultaneously with the
spectro-polarimetric scans, have been used as a so-called anchor channel in
the reduction procedure to ensure precise alignment between the sequentially
recorded CRISP narrowband images. Following the data calibration, we obtained
two three-dimensional datacubes containing restored, aligned data with a high
angular resolution of 0.16′′. The blueshift variation from the center of the FOV
towards the edge, due to the Fabry-P´erot system, was corrected during the
reduction procedure.

We applied the Stokes Inversion based on Response functions (SIR; Ruiz
Cobo and del Toro Iniesta, 1992) code to the SST sequence acquired at 10:17
UT, obtained during the best seeing condition, to obtain maps of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength and temperature in a sub-array FOV centered on the LB region.
Using the SIR code we inverted simultaneously the spectra acquired in both
the lines of the Fe I line pair at 630.1/630.2 nm. Stokes I values in the red
wing of the Fe I 630.25 nm line were not included in the proﬁle of the inverted
pixels because the signal is altered by telluric lines and, for low temperatures, by
molecular blends. We used two diﬀerent models as initialization of the inversion,
depending on the region, identiﬁed by a threshold in the continuum intensity,
forming the FOV: a penumbral model (0.4 < I/Ic < 0.8) and an umbral model
(I/Ic < 0.4). In the penumbral model, we changed the temperature (T ) and the
electron pressure (pe− ) using the values described by del Toro Iniesta, Tarbell,
and Ruiz Cobo (1994), and we used a value of 1000 G for the magnetic ﬁeld
strength, and 1.0 km s
for the LOS velocity. For the umbral model we used
the T and pe− values provided by Collados et al. (1994) (corresponding to an
umbral model for a small spot), and we used a constant value of 2000 G for
the magnetic ﬁeld strength as an initial guess. The temperature stratiﬁcation of
each component was modiﬁed with two nodes.

−1

The other physical parameters (magnetic ﬁeld, LOS velocity, inclination and
azimuth angles) were assumed to be constant with height (number of nodes equal
to one). We used thus Milne-Eddington-like approximation to provide estimation
of the average physical parameters over the range of line formation heights. A
ﬁxed macroturbulence velocity of 2.95 km s
was used in order to mimic the
eﬀects of the spectral point spread function (PSF) of the instrument. A ﬁxed
ﬁlling factor of one was used for the inversion. The straylight contamination was
not considered during the inversion owing to the fact that the Stokes I proﬁle in
the Fe I line at 630.2 nm is heavily aﬀected by blends, thereby severely aﬀecting
our ability to determine its contribution. We decided to apply more weight to Q,
U, and V Stokes parameters, by a factor of four with respect to Stokes I owing
to the larger noise in the intensity than in the polarization proﬁles. Therefore,
due to the uncertainties that could aﬀect the velocity values derived from the

−1

SOLA: manuscript.tex; 2 October 2018; 12:36; p. 5

Falco et al.

SIR inversion, we decided to derive the Doppler velocity by applying a Gaussian
ﬁt to the Fe I line proﬁle at 630.15 nm. Moreover, the CRISP dataset was not
used to study the inclination angle because the LB’s FOV was not suﬃcient to
apply the nonpotential magnetic ﬁeld calculation (NPFC) code.

To study the kinematics in the LB region, we obtained the Doppler velocity
of plasma motions by applying to ﬁve sequences of the SST dataset a Gaussian
ﬁt to the Fe I line proﬁle at 630.15 nm with the MPFIT routine (Markwardt,
2009) in Interactive Data Language (IDL). The values of LOS velocity were
deduced from the Doppler shift of the centroid of the ﬁtted line proﬁles in each
spatial point. The LOS velocity map was calibrated by subtracting the mean
velocity of the pixels of the umbra in the FOV (pixels which have a threshold of
the continuum intensity lower than 0.4 I/Ic), assuming that the umbra of the
sunspot was at rest, according to Balthasar and Schmidt (1993). We estimated
the uncertainty aﬀecting the velocity measurements considering the standard
deviation of the centroids of the line proﬁles estimated in all points of the FOV.
Thus, the estimated relative error in the velocity is ±0.2 km s
. Moreover, we
remind the reader that, given the position of AR 11263 at N16W43, the measured
LOS velocities do not correspond to velocities perpendicular to the solar surface.

3. Results

Figure 1 shows the HMI/SDO continuum image and the corresponding mag-
netogram taken on 6 August 2011 for NOAA AR 11263. On this day the AR
is characterized by a preceding main negative polarity sunspot showing a light
bridge and by several smaller positive polarity ones (see left and right panels of
Figure 1).

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the preceding spot from 3 to 6 August 2011.
The well-deﬁned umbra and penumbra (Figure 2, top left panel), start to frag-
ment on 4 August, when the penumbral ﬁlaments in the north-western part of
the spot seem to penetrate in the umbral region (see the red contour in Figure
2, top right panel). On 5 August (Figure 2, bottom left panel) the preceding
sunspot exhibits two umbrae with diﬀerent shapes, one more elongated and the
other with a more circular shape, inside the same penumbra. The LB appears and
completes its formation on 6 August, before the start of the CRISP observations
analysed in the following (the CRISP’s FOV is indicated by the box in Figure
2, right bottom panel).

Figure 3 shows the continuum intensity map observed by CRISP on 6 August
at 10:17 UT, with the LB oriented approximately along the north-south direc-
tion. It is worth noting that the radial distribution of the penumbral ﬁlaments
is modiﬁed in the regions near the LB. In fact, penumbral ﬁlaments south of the
LB are smaller than the others around the sunspot. Moreover, in this area the
photospheric granulation seems to prevail over the penumbra. Further, to the
north-east of the LB we note some small dark regions characterized by a local
higher value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength (compare with Figure 4, top panel).
In Figure 4 we show the magnetic ﬁeld strength and inclination angle maps
in the local solar frame obtained by the MERLIN inversion on Hinode/SP data.

SOLA: manuscript.tex; 2 October 2018; 12:36; p. 6

Kinematics and Magnetic Properties of a Light Bridge in a Decaying Sunspot

In the bottom panel 0◦ and 180◦ correspond to radially outward and inward
magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. The magnetic ﬁeld strength map indicates that in
the LB region the magnetic ﬁeld strength is lower than in the surroundings.
The inclination map shows in the region of the LB an inclination angle lower
than the magnetic ﬁeld inclination of the two umbral zones, where it is ≈ 180◦.
These lower inclination angles are more evident between 210′′ and 220′′ in the y
direction, corresponding to the northern part of the LB.

We restricted our analysis of the LB properties to the data acquired by
CRISP/SST at 10:17 UT in the FOV indicated by the box reported in Fig-
ures 3 and 4. We divided the LB into two parts, characterized by a diﬀerent
conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld at its sides: the northern part (corresponding
to the upper part of the LB and indicated by LBn in Figure 5 and Figure 6)
with the larger umbral core of the spot at the eastern side and the penumbral
ﬁlaments at the opposite side (compare with Figure 3), and the southern part
(corresponding to the bottom part of the LB and indicated by LBs in Figures 5
and 6) with the two umbral cores at both sides.

In Figure 5 (top panel) we show a ≈ 90◦ rotated zoomed image of the LB
region displayed in Figure 3 (white box), where the black line indicates the dark
lane of the LB. The narrow dark lane along the main axis of the LB has an
average width of 0.3′′ and a length of about 8.0′′. It seems to connect two dark
penumbral ﬁlaments located at both sides of the LB. Moreover, the LB appears
segmented along its length by tiny granules (sizes from 0.2′′ to 0.8′′) separated
by narrow dark lanes oriented perpendicularly to the LB axis. In the other panels
of Figure 5 we plot the LOS velocity along the dark lane measured around the
time of the best seeing sequence (10:17:05 UT). These plots show that, in the
LBn region, the LOS velocity values are between 0 and −0.2 km s
(negative
velocity values indicate motions toward the observer), while, in the LBs region,
the LOS velocity is higher and can reach up to −0.8 km s
. Therefore, we note
that the dark lane shows mostly motions toward the observer, which appear to
be higher in LBs where the LB is located between two umbral regions. We can
see that this trend of the LOS velocity along diﬀerent portions of the LB persists
at least for 4-5 minutes, i. e., for a lifetime comparable with the lifetime of the
LB granules.

−1

−1

Therefore, in order to investigate how the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld
at the LB sides can inﬂuence the dark lane properties, we studied the intensity,
the magnetic ﬁeld strength, the temperature, and the LOS velocity inside and
around the LB at 10:17:05 UT (see Figure 6) with particular attention to the
vertical segments reported in Figure 5 (bottom panel), where the LOS velocities
of the dark lane are completely diﬀerent.

The granules at the western side of the LBn (see the white arrow in the LBn
portion in Figure 6, top left panel) are larger than the ones at the eastern side
(conversely in the southern part of the LB). The maps of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength and of the temperature at log(τ5) = 0.0 (where τ5 is the optical depth
at 500.0 nm) obtained by the SIR inversion (Figure 6, top right and bottom left
panels) indicate that the granules of the LB that are characterized by a larger size
correspond to regions with a weaker magnetic ﬁeld and a higher temperature.
The LOS velocity of the plasma along the LB is on average lower in value (of the

SOLA: manuscript.tex; 2 October 2018; 12:36; p. 7

Falco et al.

−1

order of ≈ ±0.6 km s
) than the LOS velocity in the neighbouring penumbral
ﬁlaments, where the LOS component is of the order of ≈ 2 km s
due to the
Evershed ﬂow (note that in Figure 6, bottom right panel, the LOS velocities
−1
are saturated between −1 and +1 km s
to make more visible the LOS velocity
values along the LB).

−1

In Figure 7 are analyzed the intensity, the magnetic ﬁeld strength, the tem-
perature, and the LOS velocity along the two segments perpendicular to the
LB drawn in Figures 5 (bottom panel) and 6. The plots in the left and in the
right columns of Figure 7 correspond to the above physical quantities along
the segments in the northern and in the southern part of the LB, indicated in
Figure 6 by labels 1 and 2, respectively. The vertical line in the plots indicates
the location of the dark lane.

We note that the intensity of the dark lane is about 0.8 I/Ic for both parts of
the LB (see Figure 7, top panels). In the LBn (Figure 7, top left panel) we see that
at both sides of the dark lane there are two maxima in the continuum intensity.
They correspond to the granules of the LBn along the line 1. The largest granule
has a size of about 0.8′′ and is characterized by a magnetic ﬁeld strength between
700 G and 1000 G (see Figure 7, second left panel). The smallest granule has a
size of about 0.2′′ and a magnetic ﬁeld of about 1500 G. The same behavior is
detected in the region selected in LBs (see Figure 7, ﬁrst two right panels). The
temperature at log(τ5) = 0 in the dark lane is about 6000 K (see Figure 7, third
panel from the top), while the larger granules of the LBn reach a temperature
of about 6400 K.

−1

In Figure 7 we note that the dark lane in the LBn is almost at rest (see
bottom left panel), while the granules at its sides are characterized by motion
outward the observer (higher in the larger granule). The dark lane in the LBs
(see bottom right panel) shows motion toward the observer of the order of ≈
−0.6 km s
in
the surrounding region. Moreover, in Figure 7 (bottom right panel) the motions
toward the observer exceeding −0.5 km s
present a slight shift with respect
to the location of the dark lane. We think that this slight shift may be due to
a foreshortening eﬀect, taking into account that the AR is far from the central
meridian.

and motion outward the observer between 0.1 and 0.4 km s

−1

In order to study how the inclination angle changes inside and in the surround-
ings of the LB, we used the data acquired by Hinode/SP at 10:05 UT. In Figure 8
the Hinode maps of the continuum intensity and inclination angle, obtained using
the MERLIN code, are shown for the region containing the LB. We studied the
proﬁle of the magnetic ﬁeld inclination along the two segments drawn in Figure
6 and reported in blue and red colors in Figure 8. The inclination angle along the
blue line of Figure 9 (which refers to the LBn region, located between an umbral
region and a penumbral region) shows that in the eastern umbral region the
magnetic ﬁeld inclination has values around 170◦, it reaches values lower than
155◦ in the center of the LBn and slightly more vertical values in the western
penumbral region. In the LBs (red line in Figure 9), located between two umbral
regions, the inclination angle decreases to a minimum in the LBs (≈ 155◦), but
at both sides in the umbra the inclination angle is ≥ 165◦. Given that MERLIN
inversions do not provide the errors of the parameters, we estimate the errors

SOLA: manuscript.tex; 2 October 2018; 12:36; p. 8

Kinematics and Magnetic Properties of a Light Bridge in a Decaying Sunspot

of these measurements from the inversion of the Hinode/SP data using another
Milne-Eddington-based code (Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector (VFISV);
Borrero et al., 2011). The typical range of the standard deviation (1σ) for the
inclination maps is between 2◦ and 5◦. Thanks to this accuracy, we can also
appreciate the small diﬀerence in the inclination in the two diﬀerent regions of
the LB.

4. Discussion

In order to interpret the LOS velocities found in the LB, that have been shown
and analysed in Figures 5 and 7, we have to discuss if such motions toward/outward
the observer may be related to upﬂows/downﬂows. We remember that, in any
position diﬀerent from the disk center (cos(θ) = 0), the LOS velocity is given by

vLOS = vz × cos(θ) ± vh × sin(θ)

(1)

where vz is the upﬂow/downﬂow (vertical) component and vh is the horizontal
component of the velocity, and θ is the heliocentric angle. To understand which
velocity component prevails in the region of the LB, we produced a scatter plot
of I/Ic and LOS velocity in a region of quiet Sun (contained in the FOV) and
in the LB region. Figure 10 (top panel) shows that there is a rather clear corre-
lation (r = −0.467) in the quiet Sun: brighter points, which correspond to areas
occupied by granules that harbor upﬂows, exhibit motions toward the observer,
while darker points, corresponding to dark lanes that harbor downﬂows, exhibit
motions away from the observer. So, in a statistical sense, vh is null and we can
safely assume that LOS velocity in the quiet Sun is indicating upward/downward
motions. Then, we checked if a comparable correlation could be found also in the
region of the LB. However, in the scatter plot relevant to the LB region shown
in Figure 10 (bottom panel), where we included the data of the ﬁve sequences
studied in Figure 5 to increase statistics, we note only a very slight negative
correlation (r = −0.106).

The latter result would seem to make us less conﬁdent that we can associate
LOS velocities to upﬂows/downﬂows in the LB region. Nonetheless, we can
further observe that, even if we had vh 6= 0, such a residual component can
be neglected in our analysis.

As a matter of fact, it is known that LBs and penumbral ﬁlaments share a
common origin (Spruit and Scharmer, 2006), thus one would expect that if there
are large horizontal velocities in the LB, they should be Evershed-like velocities.
However, in the LOS map we do not observe such Evershed-like motions (see
Figure 6, bottom-right panel) toward the disk or the limb. Therefore, we are sure
that Evershed-like horizontal motions are not aﬀecting our results. Furthermore,
we note from Figure 3 that the direction of the main axis of the LB is almost
perpendicular to the direction of the disk center. Horizontal velocities perpendic-
ular to the disk center do not contribute to the measured LOS velocities, because
the angle between the LOS direction and vh is 90◦ in such a conﬁguration. Any

residual vh should be oriented along a direction parallel to the main axis of the
LB, giving no contribution to the measured LOS velocity.

We can conclude that the LOS velocities that we studied have a vertical
velocity component which prevails over the horizontal component and, then, we
can refer to those velocities as upﬂow and downﬂow plasma motions also in the
region of the LB.

5. Summary and Conclusions

Understanding the interplay between plasma convection and the magnetic ﬁeld
distribution in sunspot ﬁne structure is fundamental in order to have useful hints
on the magneto-hydrodynamical processes occurring in the solar atmosphere and
in the underlying layers, hidden from direct observations.

In this framework, this study is aimed at providing a contribution to the
understanding of the magnetic and kinematic properties of small-scale features
observed in LBs. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed CRISP data for a sequence
acquired on 6 August 2011 at 10:17 UT along the Fe I line proﬁle (630.15 nm
and 630.25 nm). The FOV of interest contains the preceding, negative polarity
sunspot of AR NOAA 11263 where, according to HMI/SDO data analysis, a LB
had formed in the previous days. The sunspot was in the decaying phase and the
presence of a LB is evidence of the re-establishment of the granulation within
the spot. The LB is quite deﬁned and presents a granular morphology, with a
dark lane along all the length of its main axis; according to Sobotka, Bonet, and
Vazquez (1994), this LB is a strong light bridge (SLB).

From the investigation of the continuum intensity images of the sequence
acquired by CRISP at 10:17 UT, during the best seeing conditions, we conﬁrm
that the LB was segmented: it was in fact characterized by a central dark lane
having at its sides granules of diﬀerent sizes separated by tiny intergranular lanes.
The LB was an interesting target because it was characterized by a diﬀerent
conﬁguration at its sides along its length: the southern part was located between
two umbral cores, while the northern part was located between an umbral core
at one side and penumbral ﬁlaments on the other side.

Using the CRISP data, we analyzed the thermal and kinematic properties
separately for the upper and lower parts of the LB located between the umbral
and the penumbral ﬁlaments (LBn) and between the dark umbral cores (LBs),
respectively. In the LBn there are grains of diﬀerent size along the dark lane:
grains on the western part have a size of about 0.8′′ and magnetic ﬁeld of ≈ 700
G, while the grains on the eastern part have a size of about 0.2′′ and magnetic
ﬁeld of ≈ 1500 G. In the LBs the larger ones are the grains on the eastern side
of the dark lane. The width of the dark lane is about 0.3′′, in agreement with
the results obtained by Berger and Berdyugina (2003). Furthermore, we found
that the intensity of the LB granules is about 0.9 I/Ic.

The results of this analysis, shown in Figure 7, indicate that in both portions
of the LB the dark lane has an intensity of 0.8 I/Ic and a temperature at
log(τ5) = 0 of about 6000 K.

Kinematics and Magnetic Properties of a Light Bridge in a Decaying Sunspot

Nordlund and Scharmer (2010) found a cusp-shaped central dark lane in a LB
formed in a three-dimensional MHD simulation of a ﬁeld-free gap surrounded
by an umbral-like atmosphere and predicted that the dark lane in sunspot LBs
harbors upﬂows. The conﬁrmation of these outcomes derived from numerical
simulations with observations is challenging. High spatial resolution observations
have shown in fact that LBs are highly spatially structured, with convective mo-
tions occurring on spatial scales of a few arcseconds. The mixing of information
from these features, if not resolved, can thus lead to wrong estimates of the sign
of the plasma velocities, thus explaining the discrepancy of results reported in
the literature (Rimmele, 1997).

Moreover, we observed a diﬀerent behaviour in the plasma motions in the
LBs and LBn, characterized by diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations at the sur-
roundings. The LBs is located between two regions with almost vertical magnetic
ﬁelds (see the red plot in Figure 9). The dark lane in this region hosts motions
toward the observer with LOS velocity between −0.2 and −0.6 km s
, as shown
also in Figure 5. This last ﬁnding is in agreement with the results of Rouppe
van der Voort, Bellot Rubio, and Ortiz (2010) and conﬁrms the hypothesis that
the dark lane is a cusp-like region where the plasma piles up as a consequence of
braking of vertical ﬂows. On the other hand, the LBn is located between regions
with an almost vertical magnetic ﬁeld at one side and a more inclined ﬁeld on
the other side (see the blue plot in Figure 9). The dark lane in this region shows
weaker motions toward the observer, probably indicating that the process of
plasma pile-up in this condition is somehow modiﬁed.

−1

Therefore, we conclude that the conﬁguration of the surrounding magnetic
ﬁeld can play an important role not only in the formation of a cusp-like re-
gion with enhanced density and corresponding to the dark lane, but also in
the vertical upﬂow usually observed along these structures. The results ob-
tained from our study thus support recent MHD simulations and observations
of magneto-convection in sunspot atmospheres.
