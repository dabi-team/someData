ABSTRACT

The energy release and build-up processes in the solar corona have signiﬁcant implications in partic-
ular for the case of large recurrent ﬂares, which pose challenging questions about the conditions that
lead to the episodic energy release processes. It is not yet clear whether these events occur due to the
continuous supply of free magnetic energy to the solar corona or because not all of the available free
magnetic energy is released during a single major ﬂaring event. In order to address this question, we
report on the evolution of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and the associated net Lorentz force changes in
ARs 11261 and 11283, each of which gave rise to recurrent eruptive M- and X-class ﬂares. Our study
reveals that after the abrupt downward changes during each ﬂare, the net Lorentz force increases by
(2–5) × 1022 dyne in between the successive ﬂares. This distinct rebuild-up of net Lorentz forces is
the ﬁrst observational evidence found in the evolution of any non-potential parameter of solar active
regions (ARs), which suggests that new energy was supplied to the ARs in order to produce the re-
current large ﬂares. The rebuild-up of magnetic free energy of the ARs is further conﬁrmed by the
observations of continuous shearing motion of moving magnetic features of opposite polarities near
the polarity inversion line. The evolutionary pattern of the net Lorentz force changes reported in this
study has signiﬁcant implications, in particular, for the forecasting of recurrent large eruptive ﬂares
from the same AR and hence the chances of interaction between the associated CMEs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are
the most energetic phenomena that occur in the solar
atmosphere. Together they can release large amounts
of radiation, accelerated high-energy particles and gi-
gantic clouds of magnetized plasma that may have se-
vere space-weather impacts (Gosling 1993; Siscoe 2000;
Daglis et al. 2004; Green et al. 2018). Therefore, under-
standing the source region characteristics of these so-
lar energetic events has become a top priority in space-
science research.

Complex large active regions (ARs) on the Sun are
the main sources of large ﬂares and most energetic CMEs
(Zirin & Liggett 1987; Sammis et al. 2000; Falconer et al.

2002; Wang & Zhang 2008; Tschernitz et al. 2018; Tori-
umi & Wang 2019). Understanding the energy build-up
processes in the source ARs has signiﬁcant implications
in particular for the case of recurrent ﬂares, which may
lead to recurrent CMEs and hence to their interaction, if
the following CME has a larger speed than the preceding
one.

Recurrent large ﬂares pose challenging questions re-
garding the conditions that lead to the episodic energy
release processes (Nitta & Hudson 2001; DeVore & An-
tiochos 2008; Archontis et al. 2014; Romano et al. 2015).
In particular, it is not yet clear whether these events oc-
cur due to the continuous supply of free magnetic energy
to the solar corona or because not all of the available
free magnetic energy is released during a single ﬂaring
event. Emergence of new magnetic ﬂux (Nitta & Hud-
son 2001) or photospheric shearing motions (Romano
et al. 2015) have been observed during recurrent ﬂares.

However, quantitatively it is diﬃcult to study the tem-
poral evolution of the free magnetic energy of any AR
due to the absence of any practical or direct method to
measure the vector magnetic ﬁeld in the coronal volume
(Wiegelmann et al. 2014). Therefore, the spatial and
temporal evolution of source region parameters which
can be solely estimated from the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld becomes important to probe the energy generation
processes responsible for solar ﬂares.

Hudson et al. (2008) were the ﬁrst to quantitatively
estimate the back reaction forces on the solar surface re-
sulting from the implosion of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld,
which is required to release the energy during ﬂares.
They predicted that the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds
should become more horizontal after the ﬂare due to the
act of the vertical Lorentz forces on the solar surface.

Fisher et al. (2012) introduced a practical method to
calculate the net Lorentz force acting on the solar pho-
tosphere. Since then, it became one of the important
non-potential parameters to study the ﬂare-associated
changes in the source region characteristics. Earlier
studies revealed that large eruptive ﬂares are associated
with an abrupt downward change of the Lorentz force
(Petrie & Sudol 2010; Petrie 2012). Comparing the mag-
nitude of those changes associated with eruptive and
conﬁned ﬂares, Sarkar & Srivastava (2018) reported that
the change in Lorentz force is larger for eruptive ﬂares.
However, studies on the evolution of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld and the associated Lorentz force changes
for the case of recurrent eruptive large ﬂares have not
been performed so far.

In this Letter, we study the evolution of the photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld and the associated net Lorentz
force change during recurrent large ﬂares which occurred
in AR 11261 and AR 11283. Tracking the evolution of
the net Lorentz force over the period of all the recurrent
ﬂares under study, we address the following key ques-
tions.

(i) Are the observed changes in net Lorentz force dur-
ing the ﬂare related to the linear momentum of the as-
sociated CME?

(ii) Are there any prominent signatures related to the
Lorentz force evolution which might reveal the restruc-
turing of the magnetic ﬁeld after the ﬁrst ﬂare and its
associated CME? If so, these signatures might be in-
dicative of rebuild-up of non-potentiality of the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld and hence the imminent more powerful
ﬂare/CME.

(iii) What causes the build-up of free magnetic energy

between the successive ﬂares?

2. DATA ANALYSIS

All the large recurrent M- and X-class ﬂares that
occurred in ARs 11261 (SOL2011-08-03T13:17 and
SOL2011-08-04T03:41) and 11283 (SOL2011-09-06T01:35,
SOL2011-09-06T22:12 and SOL2011-09-07T22:32) were
well observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).
To study the evolution of the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld associated with the recurrent ﬂares, we have used
the HMI vector magnetogram series from the version
of Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP;
Turmon et al. 2010) having a spatial resolution of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)
and 12 minute temporal cadence.

As the errors in the vector magnetic ﬁeld increase to-
wards the limb, we have restricted our analysis to only
those ﬂares for which the ﬂaring location of the AR was
well within ± 40◦ from the central meridian. Moreover,
we focus on the recurrent ﬂares that initiated in the same
part of the polarity inversion line of the AR and occurred
within an interval of a day or less than that. This ap-
proach allows us to study the energy release and rebuild-
up processes related to the recurrent ﬂares by tracking
the magnetic properties of a same ﬂare-productive part
of an AR over a period of several days. Following the

aforementioned criteria, we analyze the two recurrent
M-class ﬂares (SOL2011-08-03T13:17 and SOL2011-08-
04T03:41) which occurred in AR 11261 during 2011
August 3 to 4 and three recurrent ﬂares (SOL2011-
09-06T01:35, SOL2011-09-06T22:12 and SOL2011-09-
07T22:32) which occurred in AR 11283 during the pe-
riod 2011 September 5 to 8 (Table 1).

To calculate the net Lorentz-force changes we have
used the formulation introduced by Fisher et al. (2012).

the Lorentz force within a temporal window of δt is given

where Bh and Br are the horizontal and radial compo-
nents of the magnetic ﬁeld, Fh and Fr are the horizontal
and radial components of the Lorentz force calculated
over the volume of the active region, Aph is the area of
the photospheric domain containing the active region,
and dA is the elementary surface area on the photo-
sphere. Similar to Petrie (2012), we have reversed the
signs in Equations 1 and 3 compared to the Equations 9
and 10 of Fisher et al. (2012), as we are considering the

forces acting on the photosphere from the above atmo-
spheric volume instead of the equal and opposite forces
acting on the above atmosphere from below.

As the ﬂare related major changes in horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld and Lorentz forces are expected to occur close
to the polarity inversion line (PIL) (Wang 2006; Petrie
& Sudol 2010; Petrie 2012; Sarkar & Srivastava 2018),
we have selected subdomains (shown by the region en-
closed by the green rectangular boxes in Figure 1) near
the PIL on the ﬂare productive part of each AR to carry
out our analysis. As the recurrent ﬂares studied in this
paper occurred from the same part of the PIL, we are
able to capture the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld over
several days including the time of each ﬂares within that
same selected domain on the AR. In order to deﬁne the
size, orientation, and location of the selected domains
we examined the post-ﬂare loops observed in the AIA
171 and 193 ˚A channels. Several studies have shown
that the ﬂare-reconnection process results in the simul-
taneous formation of a post-eruption arcade (PEA) and
a ﬂux rope above the PEA during solar eruptive events
(Leamon et al. 2004; Longcope & Beveridge 2007; Qiu
et al. 2007; Hu et al. 2014). Therefore in order to cap-
ture the magnetic imprints of the recurrent large erup-
tive ﬂares on the solar photosphere, we have selected our
region of interest in such a way so that the major post

ﬂare arcade structures formed during each ﬂare can be
enclosed within that domain. The choice of such sub-
domains enables us to assume that the magnetic ﬁeld
on the side-boundaries enclosing the volume over those
selected regions is largely invariant with time and the
ﬁeld strength on the top boundary is negligible as com-
pared to that at the lower boundary on the photosphere.
Therefore, only the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld change
contributes to the surface integrals as shown in Equa-
tions 1 and 2 to estimate the change in net Lorentz force
acting on the photosphere from the above atmospheric
volume.

3. RESULT AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Abrupt Changes in Magnetic Field and Lorentz

Force

Figure 2 depicts the abrupt changes in horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld and the radial component of net Lorentz forces
calculated within the selected region of interest as shown
in Figure 1. The distinct changes in the magnetic prop-
erties of AR 11261 and AR 11283 associated with the
recurrent large M- and X-class ﬂares are discussed as
follows.

3.1.1. Magnetic Field Evolution in AR 11261

During the ﬁrst M6.0 class ﬂare (SOL2011-08-
03T13:17) that occurred in AR 11261, the mean hori-
zontal magnetic ﬁeld increases approximately from 500
to 550 G and the associated net Lorentz force shows an
abrupt downward change by approximately 2.8 × 1022
dyne. After the M6.0 class ﬂare the mean horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld started to decrease and reached about 490
G prior to the M9.3 class ﬂare (SOL2011-08-04T03:41).
During the M9.3 class ﬂare the mean horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld again approximately increased to 550 G. The
associated change in net Lorentz force during this ﬂare
is about 5.1×1022 dyne which is almost two times larger
than that associated with the previous M6.0 class ﬂare.
In order to examine whether the kinematic properties
of the associated CMEs are related to the ﬂare induced
Lorentz force changes or not, we obtain the true mass
and the deprojected speed of each ﬂare associated CME
from Mishra et al. (2017). The two recurrent CMEs as-
sociated with the preceding M6.0 class and the following
M9.3 class ﬂares are hereinafter referred to as CME1 and
CME2, respectively. Interestingly, CME2 was launched
with a speed of 1700 km s−1, approximately 1.5 times
higher than that of CME1 (v = 1100 km s−1). The true
masses of CME1 and CME2, estimated from the mul-
tiview of STEREO-A and -B coronagraph data, were
7.4 × 1012 kg and 10.2 × 1012 kg, respectively. Con-
sidering an error of ± 100 km s−1 in determining the

CME speed (Mishra et al. 2017) and ± 15 % in esti-
mating the CME mass (Bein et al. 2013; Mishra & Sri-
vastava 2014), we derive the momentum of CME2 as
17 × 1015 ± 4 × 1015 kg km s−1, approximately twice the
momentum of CME1 (8 × 1015 ± 2 × 1015 kg km s−1).
Therefore the magnitude of change in the net Lorentz
force impulse during the two recurrent ﬂares appears
to be correlated with the associated CME momentum.
This scenario is consistent with the ﬂare related momen-
tum balance condition where the Lorentz-force impulse
is believed to be proportional to the associated CME
momentum (Fisher et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012).

As the masses of the two CMEs were comparable, the
successive Lorentz force impulse within a time window of
approximately 14 hr from the same PIL of the AR with
a larger change in magnitude during the following ﬂare
appears to be an important characteristic of the source
AR in order to launch a high speed CME preceded by a
comparatively slower one. This was an ideal condition
for CME-CME interaction. Eventually, the two CMEs
interacted at a distance of 145 solar radii (Mishra et al.
2017).

3.1.2. Magnetic Field Evolution in AR 11283

For all the three recurrent ﬂares that occurred in
AR 11283, the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld and the net
Lorentz force showed abrupt changes during each ﬂare.
It is noteworthy that the net Lorentz force increases sub-
stantially 2-4 hr prior to the occurrence of each ﬂare,
followed by a steep decrease of the same. The changes in
net Lorentz force during the successive M5.3 (SOL2011-
09-06T01:35), X2.1 (SOL2011-09-06T22:12) and X1.8-
class (SOL2011-09-07T22:32) ﬂares were approximately
4 × 1022, 3.5 × 1022 and 3.5 × 1022 dyne respectively.
All the three ﬂares were eruptive and the associated
deprojected CME speeds were 640, 773, and 751 km
s−1, respectively as reported in Soojeong Jang’s Catalog
(http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/requests/ﬁleGeneration.php).
For all the three ﬂares the magnitude of change in net
Lorentz force were almost comparable and the associ-
ated CME speeds also do not diﬀer too much. As the
three associated CMEs were launched within an interval
of a day and with approximately similar speed, there
was no chance of interactions among them in the in-
terplanetary space within 1 AU. As the CDAW catalog
(https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/)
reports poor
mass estimation for the aforementioned CMEs, we do
not compare the linear momentum of those CMEs with
the associated change in net Lorentz force.

In strong events, ﬂare induced artifacts in the mag-
netic ﬁeld vectors may result in magnetic transients dur-
ing the stepwise changes of the photospheric magnetic

ﬁeld (Sun et al. 2017). However, these magnetic tran-
sients as reported by Sun et al. (2017) are spatially lo-
calized in nature and temporally can be resolved within
a timescale of ≈ 10 minutes. Moreover, the transient
features do not show any permanent changes in the mag-
netic ﬁeld evolution during the ﬂares. The evolution of
the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld and the net Lorentz force
as shown in Figure 2 are estimated within a large area
on the photosphere using the 12 minute cadence vector
magnetogram data. Therefore, within the time window
of the stepwise changes in the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld,
there is no discontinuity found in the ﬁeld evolution dur-
ing the ﬂares under this study as potentially occurring
magnetic transients would be spatially and temporally
averaged out. Hence, there are no ﬂare related artifacts
involved in the derivation of the net Lorentz force in this
study.

3.2. Lorentz Force Rebuild-up in between the

Successive Flares

After the abrupt downward change in net Lorentz
force during each large ﬂare that occurred in AR 11261
and AR 11283, the net Lorentz force started to rebuild-
up in between the successive ﬂares (see Figure 2). Start-
ing from the magnitude of −1×1022 dyne after the M6.0
class, the change in net Lorentz force reached to a mag-
nitude of 4 × 1022 dyne until the next M9.3 class ﬂare
occurred in AR 11261. Similarly in AR 11283, the net
Lorentz force was rebuilt-up by approximately 2 × 1022
dyne in between the M5.3 and X2.1 class ﬂares, and
again rebuilt-up by approximately 4 × 1022 dyne before
the X1.8-class ﬂare. This rebuild-up of the Lorentz force
reveals the restructuring of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration in the vicinity of the PIL in order to increase the
non-potentiality of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld which in
turn relaxes by producing the next recurrent ﬂare.

We tested the sensitivity of the obtained results on
the size of the bounding boxes selected around the PIL.
Increasing the bounding box (see Figure 1) from approx
20 to 40 Mm, the evolutionary pattern of the Lorentz
force remains similar. However, integrating the Lorentz
force density over the whole AR area dilutes the ﬂare
associated changes in the estimated net Lorentz force
proﬁle.

The rebuild-up of net Lorentz force in between the re-
current ﬂares could be the consequence of the continuous
shearing motion along the PIL. Figure 3 shows the con-
tinuous shearing motion observed for the two prominent
moving magnetic features (MMFs) of opposite magnetic
polarities (indicated by the red and green circles). The
antiparallel motions of these MMFs along the two sides
of the PIL of each AR during the recurrent ﬂares pro-

vide evidence for rebuild-up of non-potential energy in
between the successive ﬂares. Therefore, the evolution
of Lorentz force appears to be a clear indication of en-
ergy rebuild-up processes in order to produce successive
ﬂares from the same part of any AR.

Importantly, for the ﬁrst time we have shown the
evolution of a non-potential parameter (net vertical
Lorentz force change) that reveals the rebuild-up of non-
potentiality of the AR in between the successive large
ﬂares. Indeed, this is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding and has impor-
tant implications. In particular, the evolutionary pat-
tern of the net vertical Lorentz force change can be used
for forecasting the recurrent large eruptive ﬂares from
the same AR. Furthermore, the associated successive
CMEs from the same AR, will in turn enhance their
chance of being launched in the same direction. In this
scenario, the following faster CME may interact with
the preceding slower one in the corona or interplane-
tary space, which can signiﬁcantly enhance their geo-
eﬀectiveness (Wang et al. 2003; Farrugia & Berdichevsky
2004; Farrugia et al. 2006; Lugaz & Farrugia 2014).

Currently available machine-learning algorithms for
ﬂare prediction use, among many other parameters, the
evolution of Lorentz force integrated over the whole AR,
which does not show high skill score in the forecast ver-
iﬁcation metrics (Bobra & Couvidat 2015). However,
the distinct changes in the vertical component of the
Lorentz forces integrated near the PIL demonstrated in
our study, could prove to be an important parameter to
train and test the machine-learning algorithms in order
to improve the current capability of ﬂare-forecasting.

3.3. Relative Evolution of the GOES X-ray Flux with
that of the Associated Lorentz Force During the
Flares

The temporal evolution of the GOES 1-8 ˚A X-ray ﬂux
and the associated change in Lorentz force shows that
the Lorentz force starts to decrease at the start of rising
phase of the GOES ﬂares (Figure 4). Most interestingly,
the Lorentz force decreases with a pattern similar to the
decay phase of the GOES X-ray ﬂux during all the ﬂares.
Among all the ﬁve ﬂares (see Table 1), the decay phase
of the X2.1 class ﬂare (panel (d) of Figure 4) was signif-
icantly steeper than the other four ﬂares. This reﬂects
in the associated changes in Lorentz force. The Lorentz
force also decreases sharply during that X2.1 class ﬂare
in comparison to the other ﬂares. The derived rate of
change in net Lorentz force associated with the X2.1
class ﬂare is 3 × 1019 dyne s−1 (Figure 4), which is the
highest among all the ﬁve ﬂares studied in this work.

These results suggest that the change in Lorentz force
is not only related to the phase of impulsive ﬂare energy

release, but takes place over a longer interval and follows
a similar evolutionary pattern like the decay phase of the
GOES soft x-ray ﬂux. This could be associated with a
slower structuring of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld during
the decay phase of the ﬂaring events.

4. CONCLUSION

Studying the evolution of the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld and the associated Lorentz force change during the
recurrent large ﬂares that occurred in AR 11261 and AR
11283, we ﬁnd that the vertical component of Lorentz
force undergoes abrupt downward changes during all
the ﬂares. This result is consistent with earlier studies
(Wang 2006; Petrie & Sudol 2010; Petrie 2012; Sarkar

& Srivastava 2018). The observed increase in horizontal
magnetic ﬁeld during each ﬂare is in agreement with the
conjecture given by Hudson et al. (2008), which suggests
that the magnetic loops should undergo a sudden shrink-
age or implosion due to the energy release processes dur-
ing ﬂares. This also supports the results obtained by
Romano et al. (2015), which show a decrease in the dip
angle after each large ﬂare that occurred in AR 11283.
Interestingly, the decrease in horizontal magnetic ﬁeld
in between the successive ﬂares reported in our study,
could be due to the storage of newly supplied energy
that increases the coronal magnetic pressure, thereby

Figure 4. Relative evolution of GOES 1-8 ˚A X-ray ﬂux (black solid lines) with that of the associated Lorentz force (red solid
lines) during the recurrent ﬂares under study. The blue dotted line denotes the rate of change in Lorentz force during the ﬂares.

Our study also reveals that the decrease in Lorentz
force is not only related to the phase of impulsive ﬂare
energy release, but takes place over a longer interval that
covers also the decay phase of the ﬂaring events. The
magnitude of change in net Lorentz forces reported in
this work, appears to be correlated with the linear mo-
mentum of the associated CME. This scenario is consis-
tent with the ﬂare related momentum balance condition
where the Lorentz force impulse is believed to be propor-
tional to the associated CME momentum (Fisher et al.
2012; Wang et al. 2012).

It is noteworthy that the ﬂare-associated momentum
conservation is not only related to the bodily transfer

of mass in the form of CMEs, but also includes the
eﬀects related to explosive chromospheric evaporation
(Hudson et al. 2012). However, quantifying the momen-
tum related to the chromospheric evaporation during the
ﬂares under this study is not possible, as this requires
spectroscopic observations of both the hot upﬂowing and
cool downﬂowing plasma. Such measurements are rarely
available, due to the localized and dynamic nature of so-
lar ﬂares in contrast to the limited spatio-temporal cov-
erage of spectrometers. However, comparing the values
we obtain for the CME momentum, which is of the order
of 1015 kg km s−1, with the momentum related to chro-
mospheric evaporation ﬂows in large ﬂares as reported

in the literature, which is of the order of 1013 − 1014 kg
km s−1 (Zarro et al. 1988; Canﬁeld et al. 1990; Hud-
son et al. 2012), we may conclude that the momentum
changes related to the CME are the dominant contri-
bution. Therefore, the correlation between the Lorentz
force impulse and the CME momentum in the large re-
current eruptive ﬂares reported in our study is valid as
the eﬀects of impulsive chromospheric evaporation are
at least an order of magnitude smaller.

Most importantly, after the abrupt downward changes
during each ﬂare, the net Lorentz force signiﬁcantly in-
creases to a higher value than that was observed few
hours before the ﬂaring event, and only then the subse-
quent (recurrent) energetic ﬂare occurred. This rebuild-
up of net Lorentz force in between the successive ﬂares
suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the
vicinity of the PIL is restructured in order to increase the
non-potentiality of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. Observa-
tions of the continuous shearing motions of the MMFs
on the two sides of the PIL of each AR provide support-
ing evidence for rebuild-up of non-potential energy.

Romano et al. (2015) have also reported the shearing
motion along the PIL of AR 11283 during the recurrent
large M- and X-class ﬂares. They have attributed these
photospheric horizontal motions as the possible cause of
monotonic injection of magnetic helicity in the corona,
which might have resulted in the episodic energy release
processes, leading to the recurrent ﬂares. However, the
evolution of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld and the asso-
ciated Lorentz force reported in our study, clearly indi-
cates the energy rebuild-up processes in order to produce
successive ﬂares from the same part of the AR. There-
fore, we conclude that the recurrent ﬂares studied in this
work occurred due to the newly supplied energy to the
AR through the continuous shearing motions of photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld in between the successive ﬂares.
