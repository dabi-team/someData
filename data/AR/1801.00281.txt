Abstract

We propose to apply the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient (W GM ),
introduced in Korsos et al (2015), for analysing the pre-ﬂare and pre-CME
behaviour and evolution of Active Regions (ARs) using the SDO/HMI-
Debrecen Data catalogue. To demonstrate the power of investigative ca-
pabilities of the W GM method, in terms of ﬂare and CME eruptions, we
studied two typical ARs, namely, AR 12158 and AR 12192. The choice
of ARs represent canonical cases. AR 12158 produced an X1.6 ﬂare with
fast “halo” CME (vlinear=1267 kms−1) while in AR 12192 there occurred
a range of powerful X-class eruptions, i.e. X1.1, X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0
and X2.0-class energetic ﬂares, interestingly, none with an accompanying
CME. The value itself and temporal variation of W GM is found to pos-
sess potentially important diagnostic information about the intensity of the
expected ﬂare class. Furthermore, we have also estimated the ﬂare onset
time from the relationship of duration of converging and diverging motions
of the area-weighted barycenters of two subgroups of opposite magnetic
polarities. This test turns out not only to provide information about the
intensity of the expected ﬂare-class and the ﬂare onset time but may also
indicate whether a ﬂare will occur with/without fast CME. We have also
found that, in the case when the negative polarity barycenter has moved
around and the positive one “remained” at the same coordinates preceding
eruption, the ﬂare occurred with fast “halo” CME. Otherwise, when both
the negative and the positive polarity barycenters have moved around, the

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
AR produced ﬂares without CME. If these properties found for the move-
ment of the barycenters are generic pre-cursors of CME eruption (or lack
of it), identifying them may serve as an excellent pre-condition for reﬁning
the forecast of the lift-oﬀ of CMEs.
Keywords: AR, Flare, CME, precursor parameters

1. Introduction

There are many kinds of eruptions on the Sun and from these the solar
ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most gigantic energy ex-
plosions. These two major eruptions are powered by the free energy stored
in the stressed magnetic ﬁelds in active regions (ARs). Sunspots appear
as dark spots compared to surrounding regions on the photosphere and
are considered as good markers of ARs. The concentration of magnetic
ﬁeld ﬂuxes of AR, often modelled as ﬂux tubes, reduce the temperature in
the photosphere by inhibiting convection. Strongly twisted magnetic ﬂux
tubes and strongly sheared magnetic structures are candidates for facilitat-
ing the high intensity ﬂares and ﬂux rope eruption from AR. A number
of speciﬁc mechanisms are proposed to lead to ﬂare and CME occurrences,
e.g. sunspot rotation (Yan & Qu, 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2009;
Chandra et al., 2011; Hardersen et al., 2011; Vemareddy et al., 2016) and
shearing motion of the sunspots at photosphere (Vemareddy et al., 2012)
which contribute to helicity and accumulation of magnetic energy of an AR
(T¨or¨ok & Kliem, 2003; D´emoulin, 2007; D´emoulin & Pariat, 2009). The
magnetically complicated and highly dynamic delta-type sunspot groups
are more likely for ﬂare and CME genesis than bipolar ARs, see e.g. K¨unzel
(1960), Sammis & Zirin (2000). It is now also well known that solar ﬂares
and CMEs occur close to the polarity inversion line (PIL) (Louis et al.,
2015). The PIL can be deﬁned as the boundary separating positive and
negative magnetic polarities (Babcock & Babcock, 1955).

Flare and CME often accompany each other, but not always. Yashiro
(2006) found that the probability of a low energetic ﬂare with CME oc-
currence is much smaller than an intensive ﬂare being associated with a
large CME. If these two phenomena do occur together then the pre-, rise-
or decay-phase of a ﬂare is temporally associate with the initial-, impulsive
acceleration- or propagation-phase of a CME (Zhang et al., 2001).

A main diﬀerence between solar ﬂare and CME is the scale on which they
occur. A ﬂare is small and more local compared to a CME. Flares occur

mainly in the low solar atmosphere where magnetic ﬁeld lines of an AR are
concentrated. CME is, however, an absolutely massive eruption that may
occur on very large scales. A CME, in terms of its developed size, can even
be bigger than the Sun itself. Furthermore, a ﬂare evolves more rapidly
and produces radiation at various wavelengths which may have a nasty
consequence. For example, the higher frequencies can reach the Earth in
about 8 mins causing telecommunication disruption. Flares and CMEs are,
however, likely parts of a single, magnetically-driven physical phenomenon,
called magnetic reconnection, where highly ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁelds col-
lapse to form a lower-energy state. The magnetic shockwave generated by
a CME usually may reach the Earth in 18 to 36 hours the Earth if it has
the earthward propagation direction.

Most of the electromagnetic energy of a ﬂare is spread over frequencies
(Lin et al., 2003) outside of the visible, e.g.
in x- and γ-range. There-
fore the majority of ﬂares must be observed with instruments capable of
measurements in x- and γ- wavelength ranges, as e.g. the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Measurements of the maxi-
mum ﬂux of x-ray at wavelengths from 0.1 to 0.8 nm near Earth, as taken
by the XRS instrument on-board the GOES-15 satellite, are classed as A,
B, C, M, or X type ﬂares, where the series of GOES satellites operate back
from 1975. These ﬁve classes of ﬂare intensity categories are further divided,
on a logarithmic scale, labelled from 1 to 9. The medium category of solar
ﬂare classiﬁcation is the M-class ﬂare that may cause smaller or occasion-
ally more serious radio blackouts. The X-intensity ﬂares may give rise from
strong to extreme radio blackouts on the daylight side of the Earth.

The measured velocity of CME generally is the radial propagation speed
of the upper part of a CME frontal loop. If the linear speed is between 500-
800 kms−1 then it is called slow CME, but when the linear velocity is over
800 kms−1 than it is referred to as fast CME (Ying, 2016). Alicia et al.
(2011) found that “halo” CMEs are associated with the most energetic
ﬂares. The Earth-directed “halo” CMEs are capable of causing very strong
geomagnetic storms, therefore, their prediction has more interest in general
(Chen, 2011). Zhang & Golub (2003) found that the ﬂare association with
fast CME tends to happen within half an hour of the CME onset. Otherwise,
Zhang & Golub (2003) presented that the relationship of ﬂare associated
with slow CME onsets is less correlated.

Flare and CME have a major impact on our life and our technological
systems. An intense ﬂare may ionise the upper atmosphere of the Earth

3

which then will block the radio signals and disrupt radio communication.
The shock wave of a propagating CME may cause a geomagnetic storm
in the Earth’s magnetosphere. CMEs can have a major eﬀect on modern
society’s way of life. Very energetic particles can cause radiation poisoning
to organic systems in space. The charged particles can also disrupt satellites
and even our telecommunication and GPS-based navigation systems may
be aﬀected seriously. Magnetic storms may occasionally have major impact
on our power grids and pipe lines on Earth. A few very strong magnetic
storms have been known to black out entire regions (e.g. Canada Quebec
was catastrophically aﬀected on March 10, 1989). Therefore improving ﬂare
forecast and CME predictability along with understanding the underlying
physics is of paramount importance.

Here, we investigate the evolution of opposite magnetic polarities near
the PIL of two ARs, namely, AR 12158 and AR 12192. The AR 12158
produced an X1.6 energetic ﬂare with a fast “halo” CME and the AR 12192
was a very intense ﬂare-producer. During perceptibility of AR 12192 it was
a cradle to ﬁve X-class ﬂares without a single (known) CME. In Section 2,
we present brieﬂy the concept of the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient
(W GM ) method proposed by Kors´os et al. (2015). In Section 3, we outline
our detailed analysis of the two ARs and summarise our ﬁndings based on
applying the W GM tool. Finally, we provide discussions of our results and
draw conclusions in Sections 4.

2. Tools of the Analysis

2.1. Analysis with weighted horizontal magnetic gradient method

Kors´os et al. (2015) introduced the weighted horizontal magnetic gra-
dient (denoted as W GM ) between two opposite magnetic polarity sunspot
groups, and demonstrated that W GM could be applied to forecast the ﬂare
energy and the onset time of solar ﬂare-class above M5. The distinguishing
pre-ﬂare behaviour of W GM is that it has a steep rise and a high maximum
value followed by a less steep decrease which ends with ﬂare(s). Note that
the ﬂare does not occur at the moment of reaching the maximum value of
W GM , but afterwards during it descending phase.

The ﬁrst important diagnostic information is the intensity of expected
ﬂares (let us denote it by S) obtainable from the maximum value of the
W GM according to:

Sf lare = a · W Gmax

M + b,

4

(1)

where a = 3.58 · 10−11 ± 0.4 · 10−11 W/(m·Wb) and b = 0.08 · 10−5 ± 1.38 ·
10−5 W/m2. The standard error is ±3 · 10−5 W/m2 (Kors´os et al., 2015;
Kors´os & Ruderman, 2016).

Furthermore, the deﬁnition of W GM contains two components: total un-
signed magnetic ﬂux and the distance between the area-weighted barycen-
ters of spot groups of opposite polarities. The second potentially important
diagnostic information is the connection between the duration of converging-
diverging motion of the area-weighted barycenters of opposite polarities
that seem to be indicative of the next ﬂare(s) for all cases we investigated
in Kors´os et al. (2015). The prediction of the ﬂare onset time is based on
the relationship found between the duration of diverging motion of the area-
weighted centres of opposite polarities until the ﬂare onset (TD+F ) and time
of the compressing motion (TC) of area-weighted centres of the opposite po-
larities. Kors´os et al. (2015) have classiﬁed the selected spot groups of their
study by age - into younger or older than three days - and repeated the
investigation separately for these two groups, in order to determine how
fundamental this relationship may be. The following regression found may
be one of the most useful results of the prediction method of the W GM :

Tpred = a1 · TC + b1,

(2)

where a1 = 1.29(0.85) [hr] and b1 = 1.11(12.8) [hr] in the younger
(older) than three days case, respectively. Here, we note that the ﬂare
occurrences of the two investigated ARs manifested beyond the 72-hour
threshold measured from the AR emergence at the photosphere. Therefore
we use a1 = 0.85 [hr] and b1 = 12.8 [hr] in Equation 2 for the ﬂare onset
time estimation.

In brief, W GM may be interpreted as a proxy of the available non-
potential (i.e., free) energy to be released in a spot group. This is because
this parameter is an essential pre-cursor (but not suﬃcient) of ﬂares.
It
is found a strong increase and a high peak of W GM is needed for ﬂaring,
during which the system relaxes to lower state of energy. In fact, following
Kors´os et al. (2015) we may conclude: if the maximum of the released en-
ergy may be over ∼54% of the maximum of the accumulated (free) energy,
no further energetic ﬂare(s) can be expected; but, if the maximum of the re-
leased ﬂare energy is less than about 42%, further ﬂares are more probable.
These important properties of the W GM method were found for ﬂare(s) in
the studied cases, therefore, these features may serve as useful and practical
ﬂare watch alert tools.

3. Analysis

We have selected two ARs that may demonstrate well typical behaviours
of pre-ﬂare phase, ﬂaring with fast CME and ﬂaring without CME at all.
For the analysis we employed the SDO/HMI-Debrecen Data sunspot cata-
logue (Baranyi et al., 2016). HMIDD provides accurate and detailed posi-
tion, area, and mean estimated magnetic ﬁeld information for all observable
sunspots and sunspot groups at an hourly basis from 2010 to the end of 2014.
Figure 1 shows AR 12158 and Figure 2 depicts AR 12192 in their white-
light appearance (upper panel) and the corresponding magnetogram (bot-
tom panel). The areas encircled by the red ellipses in the upper panel of
Figures 1 and 2 are the study areas containing spots of opposite polarities.
These study areas are where the most intense ﬂares are in connection with
the location of the strongest magnetic gradient.

Figure 1: AR 12158. The X1.6 energetic class ﬂare occurred with fast “halo” CME
(vlinear = 1267kms−1). Top panel: Intensity at 13:07 on 9 September 2014. Bottom
panel: Magnetogram at 13:07 on 9 September 2014.

The resulting diagrams of W GM analysis of AR 12158 are shown in Fig.
3. AR 12158 is a typical example for the case of ﬂare occurring with a
fast CME (Vemareddy et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Fig. 3 shows the
variation of the W GM value (top panel), distance (in the middle panel) and
net magnetic ﬂux (bottom panel). Preceding the X1.6-class ﬂare, the W GM
M = 2.19 · 106 Wb/m), after that, it is
has increased to a maximum (W Gmax
followed by a less steep decrease which ends with an X1.6-class energetic
ﬂare associated with a fast, “halo” CME (vlinear=1267 kms−1). At the same

time of the increasing-decreasing phase of the W GM , one can observe the
converging and diverging motion of the area-weighted barycenters of two
subgroups of opposite polarities in the selected cluster (highlighted with
the red parabolae in the middle panel of Figure 3). Furthermore, we can
identify another converging and diverging motion before the solar eruptions
(X1.6 ﬂare with fast CME).

When the maximum value of W GM = 2.19 · 106 Wb/m is substituted
into Equation (1) that yields the predicted maximum ﬂare intensity Sf lare =
8·10−5 W/m2 in the 1-8 ˚A wavelength range of GOES, i.e. corresponding to
an expected M8.0 ﬂare, in apparent contrast to the X1.6 (Sf lare = 16 · 10−5
W/m2) ﬂare that actually took place. The highest intensity permitted by
standard error would be X1.1, which is in fact the same ﬂare intensity-class
that the actually measured X1.6 class intensity ﬂare. Therefore, there seems
to be an under-estimate.

Let us now forecast the ﬂare onset time. The accumulated free energy,
represented by W GM as a proxy measure, is released in the form of ﬂare and
a fast “halo” CME in the case of AR 12158. Equation 2 enables prediction
of the onset time of the ﬂare from the computed duration of the converging
phase (TC) of motion of opposite polarities. The ﬁrst predicted onset time
of the X1.6-class ﬂare estimated from the ﬁrst converging-diverging motion,
highlighted with the ﬁrst red parabola (middle panel, Fig. 3), is 23.85 hrs
after the minimum distance reached at 05:00 on 8 September 2014 according

to Equation 2. This predicted onset time is actually somewhat far from the
observed occurrence time of ﬂare at 17:45 on 10 September 2014. However,
the second predicted onset time of the X1.6-class ﬂare from the second
converging and diverging motion (second red parabola in middle panel of
Figure 3) is 18.75 hrs after the minimum distance reached at 18:00 on 9
September 2014 by Equation 2. This predicted onset time would be at
13:00 on 10 September 2014 which actually is now pretty close to 17:45 on
10 September 2014. Here, we conjecture that we may witness a failed ﬂare
eruption (ﬁrst red parabola) followed by a belated true one. More similar
cases would be needed to investigate before a ﬁrm conclusion is drawn. This,
however, is beyond the scope of the current study.

Next, let us now investigate how W GM can be employed as a proxy for
estimating the available non-potential energy to be released in a selected
cluster. As described above in Section 3: (i) if the maximum of the released
energy is larger than 54% no further energetic ﬂare be expected, but (ii) if

the maximum of the released ﬂare energy is less than 42%, further ﬂaring
is probable. Let us now calculate the required percentage from the rela-
tionship between the maximum value of W GM and value of W GM at the
ﬂare onset at photospheric level. The percentage computed for the X1.6
ﬂare corresponds to a 40% decrease meaning that we may expect further
eruption(s) during the decreasing phase of W GM . In fact, the X1.6 ﬂare
occurred with a huge coronal mass ejection which is a giant cloud of solar
plasma drenched with magnetic ﬁeld lines that are blown away from the
Sun. After this major CME occurrence the magnetic topology of the AR
12158 is rearranged and seems to be stabilised.

Let us now turn to the case of AR 12192 (see Fig. 4). This AR is a good
example for the ﬂare to occur without CME. It is fair to mention that this
AR is rather unusual as being extremely large but, interestingly, CME-poor.
AR 12192 has been described well in the literature (Veronig & Polanec,
2015; Jiang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016). Here, again, we notice the fol-

9

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lowing remarkable properties of the W GM and the distance. First of all, in
Fig. 4, the steep rise and a high maximum value of the weighted horizontal
gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld is still followed by a less steep decrease which
ends with X1.1-class ﬂare. Next, about 13 hrs later, after the ﬁrst max-
imum value of the W GM , one ﬁnds another steep rise and the associated
high maximum value of the ﬂux gradient, followed again, by a less steeper
decrease which ends with the series of X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0-class
energetic ﬂares. The ﬁrst maximum value of W GM = 2.9 · 106 Wb/m gives,
according to Eq. 1, the maximum predicted intensity Sf lare = 10 · 10−5
W/m2, i.e. corresponding to an expected X1.0 ﬂare. This highest predicted
intensity ﬂare class is in fact very close to the actually measured X1.1-class
intensity ﬂare. In this case, the accumulated free energy is released by the
X1.1 ﬂare. Next, we investigate the percentage of the decrease of the W GM
to the ﬂare. This percentage is a mere 28% when the X1.1-class ﬂare oc-
curred, so more ﬂare(s) would be expected. The second maximum value of
W GM = 4.0 · 106 Wb/m gives, according to Eq. 1, the maximum predicted
intensity Sf lare = 14 · 10−5 W/m2, i.e. corresponding to an expected X1.4
ﬂare, in good agreement with the next X-class ﬂare(s) that actually took
place.

Figure 6: Same as Fig. 5 but for AR 12192.

Furthermore, we note that as we follow the evolution of the distance
parameter in time we can clearly see the duration of converging and diverg-
ing motion of area-weighted barycenters of opposite polarities (highlighted
again with the red parabola in the middle panel of Figure 4) before the
X1.1- and the further duration of converging and diverging motion (the sec-
ond red parabola in the middle panel of Figure 4) for the ﬁrst ﬂare of the
series of the subsequent X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0 class ﬂares. In
fact, according to the ﬂare forecast theory based on observed sunspot data
(see Kors´os et al., 2015), the predicted onset time of the X1.1 ﬂare is 10 hrs
earlier than the observered ﬂare onset time. Next, we estimate the consec-
utive expected ﬂare onset time from the approaching and receding phases
of the distance before the ﬂare series X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0-class
energetic ﬂares. The predicted onset time of the next ﬂare is at 02:00 on 21
September 2014, according to Equation 2, and the ﬁrst ﬂare (X1.6) occurred
12 hrs later. Again, this may be a somewhat early prediction.

In Figure 4, we can see that after the second maximum of W GM during
the decreasing phase more X-class ﬂares happened. Now, we calculate the
percentage of the decrease of the W GM during the decreasing phase. So,
after the second maximum value of the W GM , in the case of the X1.6-class
ﬂare, the percentage decrease is only 20% and, indeed, more ﬂares occurred
as expected from the temporal evolution of W GM . An X3.1-class ﬂare
appears after the X1.6-ﬂare and the associated percentage of decreasing is

11

 
 
23%. The further percentage is 20% at the X1.0-class ﬂare onset and the
percentage is 35% at the X2.0-class ﬂare onset. The last observed ﬂare
is X2.0-class when the percentage of decreasing is 38% at the ﬂare onset
but no more ﬂares seem to be observed during this decreasing phase of the
W GM . Here, we note that AR 12192 turned out oﬀ the line of sight at the
west limb, so we do not know whether further ﬂare(s) occurred on the other
side of the Sun.

3.1. Analysis of foot-point motions

Let us now investigate the movement of opposite polarity sunspots be-
fore the solar eruptions in the selected clusters. In Figures 5 and 6, we follow
the area-weighted barycentres of the negative (square) and positive (trian-
gle) polarities before the solar eruptions. We use the Carrington-coordinate
system which is a coordinate system attached to the Sun. Richard C. Car-
rington determined the solar rotation rate by watching low-latitude sunspots
in the 1850s. This Carrington-coordinate system rotates with the Sun in a
sidereal frame exactly once every 25.38 days. Coordinates of the Carrington
coordinate system are heliographic latitude (B) and heliographic longitude
(L). The starting point of the Carrington frame of reference system is at
noon (GMT) on 1st of January 1854.

In Figures 5-6, the x-axis is the heliographic longitude (L) and y-axis
is the heliographic latitude (B). The colour bars demonstrate the evolution
of the opposite polarity movements of sunspots. Black ﬁlled circles demon-
strate the photospheric positions of the two area-weighted barycentres of
polarities at the ﬂare onset time.

Let us now investigate the motions of the area-weighted barycenters of
ﬂares with CME (AR 12158) and series of ﬂares without CME (AR 12192).
If we compare Figures 5 and 6 then we observe that the behaviour of the
movements of opposite polarity sunspots of the AR 12158 and the AR 12192
are rather diﬀerent before the eruptive events. In the case of a fast CME
one barycenter has not moved around much (Fig.5), while in the case of
a series of ﬂares with no CME both barycenters moved around, one even
showing a remarkable and distinctive S-shape (see Fig. 6). Therefore, we
will provide now further detailed analyses of the movements of opposite
polarity of sunspots in the two AR cases.

In the Figure 7, we follow separately the evolution of negative (black
ﬁlled circles) and positive polarity (blue ﬁlled circles) displacement as a
function of time. The reference point is the ﬁrst data point of the centres.
We have calculated the distance between coordinates of the reference point
12

and coordinates of each point as time progresses during the investigation.
We have ﬁtted a linear regressions to displacement values of the barycenters
of the negative and positive polarities of the two ARs (denote by red lines
in Figure 7), respectively. The displacement of barycentre of the positive
polarity of AR 12158 (see upper panel of Figure 7) is 0.09◦ per day but
that of the negative polarity is 0.2◦. These mean that the barycentre of the
positive polarity is indeed staying very close to the reference point, but that
of the negative polarity does not. The displacement of barycentre of the
positive polarity of AR 12192 (see lower panel of Figure 7) is 0.25◦ and the
negative polarity is 0.55◦ per day. Here, the two barycentres of polarity have
moved around considerably, especially when compared to those of a ﬂare
eruption with an accompanying CME. We also notice the periodicity (both
lower panel of Fig. 7). Could
spatially, e.g. Fig. 6, and temporally, e.g.
the be distinct and deterministic cursors for fare eruption without CME? A
preliminary insight (not shown here) indicates towards the positive answer.
For a ﬁrm conﬁrmation beyond a conjecture, another investigation is needed
on a much larger database underpinned with a rigorous statistical analysis.
We might conclude now that, for the selected clusters where we applied the
W GM method, we found that: (i) when the AR (12158) produced ﬂares
with fast CME then the negative polarity has moved around before the
fast CME occurred, and, the positive polarity sunspot “stayed” at the same
coordinates. If, however, the AR (12192) produced ﬂares without CME then
the positive and the negative polarity sunspots both have moved around.

4. Results and Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed the application of a relatively new measure
of the pre-ﬂare and pre-CME behaviour. We analysed the evolution of two
typical active regions (AR 12158 and AR 12192) by using the SDO/HMI-
Debrecen Data (HMIDD) sunspot catalogue. This two ARs individually
represent situations where (i) the ﬂare occurs with a fast CME (AR 12158)
and (ii) there is (even more) high energetic ﬂare eruptions without CME
(AR 12192). The proxy measure of our approach is a so-called weighted hor-
izontal gradient of magnetic ﬁeld (W GM ) deﬁned between spots of opposite
polarities closer to the neutral line of an AR. The value and the temporal
variation of W GM is found to possess novel, very interesting and poten-
tially important diagnostic information about the intensity and onset time
of expected ﬂares, see Kors´os et al. (2015). In the case of AR 12158 with a
fast CME, the expected ﬂare intensity by Eq. 1 underestimates by almost

an order of magnitude (the expected ﬂare was M8.0, but the occurred was
X1.6). If, however, we consider the standard error of the estimation, then,
we will arrive at least at the expected ﬂare intensity class rightly, i.e. there
is X1.1-class which is closer to the actual occurred X1.6 ﬂare intensity. On
the other hand, in the case of AR 12192, we estimated the ﬁrst expected
ﬂare intensity after the ﬁrst maximum of W GM by Eq. 1 as an X1.0-class
ﬂare and the occurred one was in fact X1.1-class. Next, we estimated the
second expected ﬂare intensity-class after the second maximum of W GM by
Eq. 1 as an X1.4-class ﬂare. Here, the ﬂare intensity ﬂare class is also well
estimated because the AR 12192 produced a healthy series of X-class ﬂares
(X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0) after the second maximum of W GM .

We have also predicted ﬂare onset times by means of Equation 2. We
have used the measured duration of the converging phase (TC) of motion
of opposite polarities for the prediction of ﬂare onset time. We have recog-
nised two converging-diverging motion before the X1.6 ﬂare that occurred
with CME from AR 12158. There was only 5 hrs between the predicted
onset time and the real occurrence time of the X1.6-class ﬂare. Here, we
14

 
 
 
 
 
note that after the ﬁrst converging-diverging motion a ﬂare may failed to
occur, and only after the second converging-diverging motion there was a
ﬂare. Two consecutive converging-diverging motions may be a pre-CME di-
agnostic tool, but we need more ﬂares with fast CME occurrence examples
for a further investigation and deﬁnite conclusion.

Next, we investigated the predicted ﬂare(s) onset time of AR 12192. We
followed the evolution of the distance parameter in time. First, we have
identiﬁed the duration of converging and diverging motion of barycenters
of opposite polarities before the ﬁrst X1.1-class eruption. Second, we also
can see a further converging and diverging motion subsequently followed by
X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0 class ﬂares. The ﬁrst predicted onset time
of the X1.1 ﬂare is 10 hrs earlier than the actual observed ﬂare onset time.
In the next step, we estimated the next expected ﬂare onset time from the
second approaching and receding phases of the distance before the series of
X1.6, X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0-class energetic ﬂares. The second predicted
onset time of the next ﬂare was at 02:00 on 21 September 2014, obtained by
Equation 2, and the ﬁrst ﬂare (X1.6) occurred 12 hrs later after the second
converging-diverging motion. Again, there seems to be an underestimate
of onset time. Note that we cannot predict onset time of the subsequent
ﬂares, but we used the percentage value of the maximum of W GM to the
value of W GM at the ﬂare onset for the prediction of intensity of the next
X3.1, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0-class energetic ﬂares.

In Kors´os et al. (2015), we proposed an empirical percentage that of
W GM that is a proxy of the available non-potential energy to be released
in a spot group. We determine this percentage value from the relationship
of the maximum of W GM and the value of W GM at the ﬂare onset. In the
case of AR 12192, the percentage of decrease is 28% at the X1.1 ﬂare onset,
so more ﬂare is expected. Next, after the second maximum value of the
W GM , in the case of the X1.6-class ﬂare, the percentage is only 20% and
indeed more ﬂares (X3.1, X1.6, X1.0, X2.0 and X2.0) occurred during the
decreasing phase of the W GM . The percentage of the maximum of W GM
and the value of W GM at the last X2.0-class energetic ﬂare is 38% but no
more ﬂares seemed to occur during the decreasing phase of the W GM . Here,
we note that the AR 12192 turned out oﬀ the west limb becoming invisible.
Perhaps the most interesting results of the present case studies are the
movements (i.e. loci) of the area-weighted barycenters of the opposite po-
larity sunspots before ﬂare and CME in the selected clusters. We have
used the Carrington-coordinate system which is a ﬁxed solar coordinate

15

system to clearly follow the evolution of the movements of barycenters of
the opposite polarity sunspots. In particular, Figures 5 and 6 reveal a very
interesting feature: they capture some distinct patterns of the behavior of
the negative and the positive polarity sunspots before ﬂares. There are two
types of ﬁgures: one for the case with fast CME (see Figure 5), another
ﬂare(s) without CME (see Figure 6). Even just a simple visual inspection
of the trajectory of sunspot barycenter motion will unveil that one may
ﬁnd distinct signatures of ﬂaring without fast CMEs, respectively, in the
trajectories of sunspots. Furthermore, we have determined separately the
evolution of negative and positive polarity displacement, i.e. as a function
of time of the two ARs (AR 12158 and AR 12192). We have found, where
there is a fast CME the negative polarity area-weighted barycenter has
moved before the fast CME and the positive polarity “stayed” at the same
coordinates. Otherwise, when the AR produced ﬂares but no CME, then
the barycenters of both the negative and the positive polarity sunspots have
moved around. This latter empirical relation may mean that the highly
stressed region would relax itself via these unwinding motions, not leaving
enough free energy there for a major mass uplift. The results are encour-
aging but we need to conﬁrm statistically this latter statement by carrying
out the study on much larger samples.
