Abstract 

In this Letter, we investigate the non-dipole effects in time delay of photoelectrons emitted 
by  multi-electron  atoms,  negative  ions,  and  respective  endohedrals.  We  present  the  necessary 
general formulas in the frame of the random phase approximation with exchange (RPAE) applied 
to  atoms,  negative  ions,  and  properly  adjusted  to  endohedrals.  We  concentrate  on  low  photon 
energy  region,  where  non-dipole  effects  are  very  small  in  the  cross-sections  but  become 
observable in angular distributions. 

We  not  only  derive  the  formulas  for  non-dipole  effects  in  time  delay,  but  perform 
corresponding  numeric  calculations.  We  demonstrate  how  the  non-dipole  corrections  can  be 
isolated  in  experiment.  Concrete  calculations  are  performed  for  noble  gas  atoms  Ar  and  Xe, 
isoelectronic  to  them  negative  ions  Cl-  and  I-  and  endohedrals  Ar(Cl-)C60  and  Xe(I-)@C60.  We 
found that the forward-backward photoelectron time delay differences give direct information on 
non-dipole effects. They proved to be quite measurable and prominently affected by the presence 
of the fullerenes shell. 

Key words: photoionization, time delay, negative ions, endohedrals 

1. 
The aim of this Letter is to find the contribution of non-dipole corrections to the time-delay 
of  electrons  that  due  to  low-energy  photon  absorption  leave  atoms  A,  negative  ions  A-  and 
endohedrals  A@CN  or  A-@CN  that  present  A  or  A-  stuffed  inside  the  fullerenes  shell  CN 
constructed  of  N  carbon  atoms  C.  Ionization  by  a  photon  with  low  energy  1  is  a  process 
determined  predominantly  by  dipole  transition  matrix  elements.  The non-dipole  contribution  to 
the absolute photoionization cross-section is much smaller than the dipole term, being different 
by  additional  factor
 ,  where  Ar the  atomic  radius,  and  c  is  the  speed  of  light.  The 
smallness of the non-dipole cross-section is enhanced by a numeric small factor.

However,  the  role  of  non-dipole  term  is  much  bigger  in  the  angular  distributions  of

  (see e.g. [1]). The investigation of non-dipole transitions is stimulated 
bigger than
by  the  interest  to  quadrupole  transitions  and  quadrupole  phase  shifts  of  the  outgoing  electron 
wave-functions.  Apart  from  angular  distribution,  there  exists  another  source  of  information  on 
these  quantities,  namely  the  time  delay  of  electrons  released  from  an  atom,  ion,  or  endohedral 
under the action of the incoming photon.

The theoretic  approach  to  temporal  description  of  processes  in  quantum  objects  has  been 
developed long ago in a number of publications [2-5]. The construction of lasers with attosecond

pulses permitted to measure the duration of atomic photoionization processes. As a result, pure 
theoretical development was relatively recently complemented by intensive experimental activity 
leading to temporal description of photoionization processes (see [6-10] and references therein). 
The corresponding times are called EWS time delays, thus referring to the names of authors  L. 
Eisenbud [2], E. Wigner [4] and F. Smith [5], respectively. 

As is demonstrated in [2-5], the time delays are well-defined quantities that characterize a 
physical  process  only  if  the  outgoing  particles  interact  via  short  range  force.  In  course  of 
photoionization the outgoing electron interacts with the residual ion with infinite range Coulomb 
interaction, making  it  impossible  to  define accurately enough scattering  phases  at any outgoing 
electron  energy
0  .  This  forced  to  calculate  time  delays  in  photoionization  starting  from  not 
too low [7, 11]. This is why in this Letter we consider along with neutral targets, A and A@CN, 
also negative ions that have the same electronic configuration as A, A- and A-@CN, for which the 
residual ion is neutral. In concrete calculations our choice are pairs Ar, Cl- and Xe, I-. As CN we 
take an almost spherically symmetric well-studied and reasonably good modelled C60 [12]. 

The time delay of a photoelectron emitted at a given angle at low   is determined by the 
interference  of  electron  waves  emitted  in  a  given  direction  due  to  absorption  of  a  photon  that 
include dipole and quadrupole terms. We will take into account the electron correlation in A(A-) 
and the action of C60 upon A(A-) as well as the action of C60 upon the outgaining electron. This 
will be done in the frame of the random phase approximation with exchange (RPAE), just as in 
[13, 14], substituting the C60 by a static potential and adding to it the account of the polarization 
of C60 electron shell by the incoming photon beam. 

The temporal description of photoionization concentrates on determining the time delay of 
2. 
an  electron  that  leaves  the  target  in  a  given  direction  after  absorbing  a  photon.  As  it  was 
demonstrated  in  [2-5],  the  time  delay    of  a  physical  process  as  a  function  of  its  energy    is 
connected  to  the  phase  of  the  amplitude  f  of  the  process  under  consideration  by  the  following

To  investigate  time-delays  in  endohedrals  A@CN,  we  substitute  C60  by  a  static  potential 
W(r) that corresponds to reasonable distribution of electric charges and satisfactorily reproduces 
60C  , just as it was done recently in [17]. We 
the experimental value of an s-electron affinity of 
call  this approach RPAEC.  The  potential  W(r)  is  added  to  the  HF  atomic  A  potential.  It  affects 
HFC and RPAEC matrix elements and phases. The chosen C60 potential is the same as in [18]

In addition to the static potential W(r) it is essential to take into account the polarization of 
the  fullerene  shell  that  essentially  modifies  the  action  of  the  incoming  light  beam  upon  the 
ionized inner atom A. Assuming for simplicity that the atomic radius Ra is much smaller than R, 
one  can  in  RPAE  frame  express  the  effect  of  dipole  and  quadrupole  polarization  by  factors

It is seen from (9), (14), (15), and (17) that 
the  quadrupole  term  adds  new  information  about 
the  photoionization  process:  includes  another 
photoionization amplitude and polarization factor, 
other  scattering  phase  differences.  It  is  essential 
that  these  characteristics  appear  in  combinations 
different from that in non-dipole corrections to the 
angular  distribution  of  photoelectrons  (see  (17)) 
[13]. Therefore the results that could be  obtained 
from  studies  of  the  non-dipole  corrections  to  the

parameters of the potential (11) are the same as in 
our  recent  papers,  e.g.  in  [11].  Inclusion  of 
fullerenes shell polarization in the RPAE frame is 
achieved  by  using  G-factors  (13),  the  parameters

In  calculations  we  determine  only  HF

scattering phases 
are  well  defined  only  for  short-range  potentials. 
Such  is  the  case  for  photoionization  of  negative 
ions and respective endohedrals. For neutral atoms 
and  their  endohedrals  the  outgoing  electron  feels 
the single charged ion’s field. As a result, the very 
notion  of  a  phase  shift  loses  its  sense.  Trial 
for  considered 
calculations  demonstrate 
objects  it  took  place  for  <0.1  Ry.  For  negative 
ions the time-delay is well defined at any energy.

Each  figure  includes  for  a  given  subshell 
results for an atom, isoelectronic negative ion and 
respective  endohedrals.  Big  negative  values  of 
time delay contradict the causality principle and as 
such  has  to  be  discarded.  However,  not  too  big 
negative values are compatible with causality due 
to  quantum  nature  of  the  photoionization  process 
(see  [4]).  The  forward  and  backward  time  delays 
are  quite  big  reaching  hundreds  attoseconds.  The 
respective  forward-backward  time  difference  is 
characterized  in  Ar  by  a  strong  maximum  that  is 
quite  noticeable  for  3p  –subshell  (see  Fig.  1)  and 
particularly big for 3s-subshell in Ar and Ar@C60

upon  time  delays  and  corresponding  non-dipole 
corrections  is  prominent,  but  only  for  Cl-  and  Cl-

We do not present results for 5p in Xe and I- 
as  well  as  respective  endohedrals  since  the 
situation there is qualitatively similar to 3p in Fig. 
1  and  due  to  lack  of  space.  Fig.  3  depicts  the 
results  for  5s-photoelectrons.  5s  photoionization 
is  strongly 
amplitude  for  considered  objects 
affected not only by outer 5p electrons but by the 
intermediate  4d-subhell  also.  The  well-known 
feature  of  4d  is  its  dipole  Giant  resonance  that 
dominates the cross-section in a broad  region – 
from about 4 to 10Ry. However, in 5s time delay 
important is only the maximum that reflects the 5p 
influence  upon  5s.  Surprisingly  enough,  only 
small  traces  of  the  Giant  resonance  exist.  The 
maxima in insets of Fig. 3 reflect the influence of the fact  that the dipole photoionization cross 
section at about 11 Ry has a Cooper minimum [13]. Fig. 4 demonstrates results for 4d subshell. 
As for 5p, the near threshold behavior is of interest, presenting quite different results for Xe and I- 
No  essential  traces  of  the  Giant  resonance  is  observed.  However  in  the  region  of  Cooper 
minimum in the photoionization cross-section we see a prominent minimum in time delays. The 
time  differences  for  Xe  and  I-  has  a  remarkable  variation  of  Fano  profile  shape  that  does  not 
correspond,  however,  to  a  discrete  level.  Instead,  it  is  a  trace  of  dipole  cross-section  variation. 
The polarization factor affects mainly the outer subshell, and leads to rather smooth addition to 
the  time  delay  near  thresholds  of  outer  and  subvalent  subshells  in  Ar,  Cl-,  Xe,  I-  and  the 
respective endohedrals. Naturally, the 4d subshell is deep enough, so the role of C60 shell is for 
all time delays negligible.

4.  We  investigated  here  the  photoionization  amplitude  at  low  photon  energies  that  includes 
along the main dipole also quadrupole contribution. Having this  amplitude, we demonstrate for 
the first time, that quadrupole corrections are quite noticeable and under concrete conditions can 
be  isolated  from  the  dipole  ones,  and  measured.  Of  particular  interest  is  the  situation  for  3s 
subshell in Ar, where the determined by quadrupole contribution time difference reaches 400 as. 
To use attosecond lasers in studies of time-delays is not a simple task since extraction from 
experiment the EWS time delays require to get rid of the additions introduced by the properties of 
the laser beam including the uncertainty in energy of the incoming photons (see e.g. [19, 11]). 

In  spite  of  difficulties,  the  theoretical  investigation  of  time  delay  differences  and  their 

experimental measurement is of interest as a source of unique information about ionized targets.
