Abstract 

AR Herculis is an RR Lyrae star of type RRab whose spectral type ranges from A7 to F3. 
Its visual brightness varies between 10.59 mag and 11.63 mag (V). By analysis of 34,000 
measurements  from  the  AAVSO  International  Database  and  additional  data  from  the 
BAV,  116  times  of  maximum  between  2003  and  2015  were  derived.  For  the  time  span 
2009  to  2015,  a  new  period  value  of  P  =  0.46999746(±145)  days  was  derived  from  the  
(O–C) analysis. Furthermore, the derived maximum timings indicate a strong Blazhko ef-
fect with a Blazhko period of PB = 32.062(±13) days. The evolution of the observed maxi-
mum brightness Vmax, which decreased from 2009 to 2015 by 22 mmag/year, is also in-
dicative  of  a  Blazhko  effect  with  PB  =  29.528(±17)  d.  The  present  work  investigates  the 
processes in the frequently used (O–C) vs. Vmax diagram by running several simulations 
based on assumed and observational data.

Introduction 

AR  Herculis  is  an  RR  Lyrae  star  of  type  RRab.  Its 
visual  brightness  varies  between  10.59  mag  and 
11.63 mag (V) and its spectral type ranges from A7 
to F3. The rise time to maximum (m–M) approxi-
mates 20% of the cycle length [Kholopov, 1988]. 

AR  Herculis  exhibits  a  strong  Blazhko  effect. 
Minimum  and  maximum  brightness  change 
considerably  over  the  Blazhko  cycle,  which  also 
holds  true  for  the  times  of  maximum  brightness 
(O–C). 

Period  |  For  the  period  1905  to  1954,  Klepikova 
[1957] determined a period of P = 0.4700234 days 
(E0 = HJD 2424794.274). For the time span 1954 to 
1967,  Lange  [1969]  derived  a  period  of  P  = 
0.469975  days  (E0  =  HJD  2439692.683).  The 
slightly  longer  period  of  P  =  0.470028  days  was 
given by Kholopov [1988] in the GCVS (E0 = HJD 
2441454.347).  The  elements  from  the  GCVS 
the  AAVSO 
(Equation  1)  were  adopted 

in 

International Variable Star Index, VSX. Feast et al. 
[2008]  gave  a  period  of  P  =  0.469981  days. 
Hübscher  [2016a]  determined  the  slightly  longer 
period  value  of  P  =  0.46998756  days  (E0  =  HJD 
2454683.4366; Equation 2).

Blazhko Effect | Balázs and Detre [1939] investigat-
ed  the  variations  in  maximum  and  minimum 
brightness  of  AR  Her.  During  the  period  1935  to 
1939,  the  maximum  photographic  brightness  was 
found  to  vary  by  an  amount  of  0.53  mag  (10.28–
10.81  mag)  and  the  minimum  photographic 
brightness by an amount of 0.34 mag (11.71–12.05 
mag),  resulting  in  amplitude  variations  between 
0.90  mag  and  1.77  mag.  Balázs  and  Detre  [1939] 
estimated a Blazhko period of PB = 31.49 days. 

Almar  [1961]  reached  the  conclusion  that  the 
observed  changes  in  period  are  very  irregular  and 
hence  difficult  to  interpret.  He  determined  a 
slightly  longer  Blazhko  period  of  PB  =  31.5489 
days. 

An even  larger Blazhko period value was given by 
Wils et al. [2006], who derived PB = 32 days. 

2  Observations 

Data  |  34,102  brightness  measurements,  which 
were  won  by  31  observers  in  the  time  span  from 
HJD 2438506 to HJD 2457277, were extracted from 
the  AAVSO  International  Database.  Only  V  and 
TG  (tricolor  green)  measurements  were  included 
into  the  analysis.  The  data  were  searched  for  time 
intervals  suited  to  the  timing  of  maximum  light 
and  the  determination  of  the  corresponding 
brightness. 

Timings of Maximum Light | Sufficiently short time 
intervals  were chosen, which allowed the determi-
nation  of  times  of  maximum  brightness  by  a 
polynomial  regression  from  2nd  to  6th  order  (3rd 
order was applied in 70% of cases). 

The  resulting  graphs  were  inspected  visually;  in 
two  cases,  the  computed  times  of  maximum 
to  be  adjusted  slightly  (the 
brightness  had 
corresponding  datasets  were  charaterized  by  very 
sharp  maxima).  Whenever  possible,  the  derived 
times  of  maximum  brightness  were  compared  to 
the  corresponding  values  determined  by  the 
AAVSO  observers.  A  very  good  agreement 
found,  which 
between  the  two  sources  was

The  derived  times  of  maximum  brightness  are 
listed in Appendix 1. 

Investigated Time Span | All derived maxima stem 
from  the  time  interval  HJD  2452745  to  2457245 
(14. 04. 2003 – 10. 08. 2015). Prior to HJD 2454880 
(17. 02. 2009), the maxima follow the (O–C) trend 
that  has  been  shown  to  exist  since  about  1990 
[Pagel  2008].  The  present  work  investigates  the 
behaviour of the period from 2009 to 2015; during 
this time span, a longer period was detected. 

103 times of maximum were derived from AAVSO 
data collected by the following 14 observers:

the AAVSO database. 

3  Results and Discussion 

3.1  Revised Elements 

Using the elements provided by the GCVS and the 
VSX  (Equation  1),  the  resulting  (O–C)  diagram 
indicates  a  jump  in  epoch,  which  is  caused  by  the 
period  being  slightly  too  long.  Thus,  the  resulting 
discrepancies  in  (O–C)  add  up  to  a  full  cycle 
during the investigated time span. 

In order to avoid this, the elements from Hübscher 
[2016a] were employed (Equation 2). The resulting 
diagram is shown in Figure 2. 

From the weighted best-fit line 

(3) O–C = –0.0115d + 9.90·10–6 ·E 

in Figure 2, the following improved elements have 
been derived:

brightness Vmax in the timespan February 2009 
to August 2015. 

The  indicated  error  has  been  based  on  a  weighted 
linear regression. It is noteworthy to point out that 
the  variations  due  to  the  Blazhko  effect  influence 
the error values. On the basis of the calculations of 
the  Blazhko  period  value  (see  below),  the  actual 
period uncertainty is estimated to be approximate-
ly half the above listed value. 

3.2  Variations in the Time of Maximum 

Figure  3  illustrates  the  changes  in  (O–C)  as  a 
function of Julian Date according to Equation (4), 
which  are  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  Blazhko 
effect.  It  has  to  be  pointed  out  that  part  of  the 
observed  scattering  is  also  due  to  measurement 
errors. 

Figure 3: 

(O–C) values as a function of HJD according to 
Equation  (4).  The  covered  time  span  is  Febru-
ary 2009 to August 2015. 

The  (O–C)  values  are  scattered  between  –0.0317 
and  0.0336  days,  which  corresponds  to  variations 
in  maximum  time  of  –6.74 %  to  7.15 %  of  the 
period due to the Blazhko effect. 

3.3  Variations in Maximum Brightness 

Figure  4  illustrates  the  temporal  evolution  of  the 
visual maximum brightness Vmax. 

In the time span 2009 to 2015, the visual maximum 
brightness  varied  between  10.28  mag  <  Vmax  < 
10.92  mag,  resulting  in  a  mean  visual  maximum 
brightness of Vmax  = 10.569 mag. 

Assuming mpg ≈ B and a mean (B–V) index of 0.17 
mag  [Weigert,  2005],  the  photographic  maximum 
brightness varied between 10.1 mag < Vmax < 10.6 
mag  during  the  time  span  1935  to  1939  [Balázs, 
1939]. 

The  more 
recently  determined  values  are 
considerably  fainter.  In  comparison  to  the  mean 
maximum  brightness  of  10.59  mag  given  by 
corresponding  value 
the 
Kholopov 
determined in the present work is slightly brighter. 

[1988], 

The long-term changes in maximum brightness are 
readily  discernible  during  the  time  span  2009  to 
2015, in which the maximum brightness continual-
ly decreased by 22 mmag/year. 

3.4  Blazhko Effect of the Time of Maximum 

In  order  to  determine  the  Blazhko  period  PB,  the 
value  set  from  Fig.  3  has  been  subjected  to  a 
Fourier  analysis  employing  the  program  package 
Period04  [Lenz,  2005].  The  best  fit  results  in  a 
Blazhko period of PB = 32.062 ±0.013 day and the 
following equation: 

(5)  O–C = –0.0017(±16) + 0.0241(±13) ·  

sin (2 · (0.03118961(±122) · t + 0.923(±8))) 

where the time (t) is given in HJD and the errors of 
the  coefficients,  which  apply  to  the  last  digits,  are 
listed in parantheses. 

From  Equations  (4)  and  (5),  the 
following, 
improved  elements  have  been  derived,  which  take 
into account the Blazhko period.

further  analysis  indicates  that,  with  the  available 
data, no significant improvement is possible.

maximum  brightness  Vmax  using  the  program 
package  Period04.  To  this  end,  the  differences  in

The  best  fit  to  the  values  in  Figure  7  results  in  a 
Blazhko  period  of  PB  =  29.528 ±0.017  days.  The 
residuals are shown in Figure 8.

Period  Control  |  In  order  to  confirm  the  derived 
Blazhko  period,  a  self-developed  period  search 
program  was  employed,  which  calculates  the 
period  from  the  least  squares  deviation  of  a 
polynomial  fit  to  the  data.  A  Blazhko  period  of 
PB = 32.054  ±0.001  days  was  calculated  from  the 
(O–C)  values,  which  is  in  agreement  with  the 
above listed period value.

to the Blazhko phase diagram based on the (O–C) 
values (Figure 6). A further analysis indicates that, 
with the available data, no significant improvement 
is possible.

Period  Control  With  the  help  of  a  self-developed 
period search program, which calculates the period 
from the least squares deviation of a polynomial fit 
to  the  data,  a  Blazhko  period  of  PB  =  29.53  ±0.01 
days  was  calculated  from  Vmax,  which  is  in 
agreement with the above listed period value. 

3.6 

(O–C) vs. Vmax  Diagram 

Poretti  et  al.  [2016]  have  shown  that,  in  RR  Lyrae 
stars,  there  often  is  a  correlation  between  the 
(O–C) values and Vmax. When plotting Vmax versus 
(O–C) in a diagram, a closed curve resembling an 
ellipse  is  derived,  often  called  'Blazhko  potatoe'. 
Certain  Vmax  values  are  observed  at  different  
(O–C)  values  and  vice  versa,  and  the  resultant 
curve  can  be  run  in  opposite  directions,  i.e. 
clockwise or anticlockwise [Le Borgne, 2012]. 

Simulation | Several simulations were run in order 
to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  processes  in 
the  Blazhko  (O–C)  vs.  Vmax  diagram.  If  the 
Blazhko  periods  derived  from  the  (O–C)  values 
and  Vmax  are  identical,  the  resultant  curve  is  a 
closed  ellipse  (Figure  10,  left  panel).  The  orienta-
tion of the line of apsides depends on the phases of 
both Blazhko periods. 

Figure 10: 

Simulation of Blazhko (O–C) vs.  Vmax diagrams 
assuming  different  Blazhko  periods.  The  step 
size  only  has  implications  on  the  density  of 
points. 

If both Blazhko periods are different, the resultant 
ellipses are not closed but open (Figure 10, middle 
panel). Furthermore, the line of apsides is rotating. 
This  becomes  obvious  in  the  case  of  large  differ-
ences  between  both  Blazhko  periods  (Figure  10, 
right  panel):  The  curve  resembles  an  open  ellipse 
and  the  line  of  apsides  is  rotating  strongly.  In 
addition  to  that,  changes  in  the  eccentricity  of  the 
ellipse are apparent. 

The  above  mentioned  periodic  changes  are  here 
described  with  a  period  I  will  refer  to  as  'Blazhko 
super period' PSuper:

(cid:1842)(cid:2903)(cid:2931)(cid:2926)(cid:2915)(cid:2928) (cid:3404)

(cid:3017)(cid:3147)–(cid:3135)	∙	(cid:3017)(cid:3271)(cid:3288)(cid:3276)(cid:3299)
(cid:4698)(cid:3017)(cid:3147)–(cid:3135)(cid:2879)	(cid:3017)(cid:3271)(cid:3288)(cid:3276)(cid:3299)(cid:4698)

In  the  course  of  a  Blazhko  super  period,  the 
direction  of  rotation  changes  twice.  This  change 
takes  place  when  the  ellipse  is  transformed  to  a 
straight  line.  The  work  of  Poretti  et  al.  demon-
strates  that  the  resultant  curves  can  be  run  in 
opposite directions, i.e. clockwise or anticlockwise. 

The  examples  shown  in  Figure  10  are  symbolic 
simulations. Nevertheless, they have been based on 
values which are close to what is actually observed 
in RR Lyrae stars. 

Figure  11  illustrates  several  Blazhko  (O–C)  vs. 
Vmax  diagrams  that  have  been  calculated  from  the 
periods  of  AR  Herculis  as  determined  in  the 
present work (PO–C = 32.062 days, PVmax = 29.528

limited  duration  will  produce  ellipsoidal  curves, 
the  observations  have  been  divided  into  7  time 
intervals, which were analysed separately. The time 
intervals  are  defined  by  the  observational  gaps  in 
the data and are obvious in Figures 3 and 7. 

Indications  of  correlated  behaviour  are  present  in 
the  time  interval  around  HJD  2456500  (blue  dots 
in Figures 12 and 13).

ited  duration.  The  mean  error  of  the  observa-
tions  is  indicated  by  the  rectangle  in  the  bot-
tom right corner. 

After arranging the measurements chronologically 
and connecting them with a line, there are indica-
tions of a counterclockwise rotation.

for AR Herculis, based on the periods of 32.062

added  which  corresponds  to  the  mean  meas-
ured  errors  in  (O–C)  (±0.0039  days)  and  Vmax 
(±0.0047  mag).  The  left  panel  illustrates  each 
maximum during a time span of 100 days. The 
middle  panel  has  been  based  on  each  fifth 
maximum  in  the  same  time  span.  The  right 
panel shows each fifth maximum during a dif-
ferent 100-day interval. 

Because  of  the  rotation  of  the  line  of  apsides  and 
the  changes  in  eccentricity,  an  ellipsoidal  curve  is 
present only in a short time interval like e.g. three 
Blazhko  periods.  In  the  case  of  AR  Herculis,  this 
corresponds to about 100 days. The first simulated 
plot  (Figure  11, left panel) illustrates the positions 
of  the  maxima,  taking  into  account  each  single 
maximum.  The  second  simulation  (Figure  11, 
middle  panel)  has  been  based  on  each  fifth 
maximum  only  (assuming  an  even  distribution). 
From  the  resulting  loose  cloud  of  points,  the 
ellipsoidal  shape  can  hardly  be  divined.  The  third 
simulation (Figure 11, right panel) is equivalent to 
the  second  one  but  has  been  based  on  a  different 
100-day time interval. 

The presence of a discernible ellipse in the Blazhko 
(O–C) vs. Vmax diagram of an RR Lyrae star (as e.g. 
AR  Herculis) 
is  therefore  dependent  on  the 
difference  of  the  observed  periods,  the  density  of 
maximum  timings,  and  the  time  interval  of  the 
Blazhko super period. 

In  the  case  of  AR  Herculis,  the  observed  Blazhko 
periods  of  32.062  days  and  29.528  days  result  in  a 
Blazhko  super  period  of  373.6  days.  Thus,  the 
observed direction of rotation should change every 
186.8 days. 

In order to investigate this, the maximum timings 
of  AR  Her  have  been  plotted  in  Figure  12.  After 
plotting all observed maxima collected over a time 
span of 2,366 days, no ellipsoidal shape is discerni-
ble.  To  tackle  the  question  if  time  intervals  of 

 
 
 
Assuming  the  presence  of  a  datapoint  between 
measurements #3 and #4 (at HJD 2456460±1, near 
measurement  #16  in  the  plot),  a  roughly  circular 
shape is conceivable. 

The  represented  period  of  100  days  encompasses 
three  complete  cycles,  i.e.  one  cycle  is  about  32 
days  –  a  value,  which  corresponds  exactly  to  the 
determined Blazhko period. 

4  Conclusion 

For the time span 2009 to 2015, a new period value 
of  P  =  0.46999746(±145)  d  was  derived  from  the 
irregular 
(O–C)  analysis.  This  confirms 
variations  in  period  that  have  been  observed  for 
more  than  100  years  in  AR  Herculis.  Apparently, 
the period is apt to change in the time span of a few 
months, after which it remains practically constant 
for several years. 

the 

An analysis of the derived maximum timings indi-
cates a strong Blazhko effect with a Blazhko period 
of  PB  =  32.062(±13)  days.  The  evolution  of  the 
observed  maximum  brightness  Vmax,  which 
decreased  from  2009  to  2015  by  22  mmag/year, 
also indicates the presence of a Blazhko effect with 
PB = 29.528(±17) days. 

Thus,  the  Blazhko  period  derived  from  Vmax  is 
about  8%  shorter;  it  is  also  subject  to  long-term 
variations  (declining  at  present).  Therefore,  11.65 
(O–C) Blazhko periods fit into 12.65 Vmax Blazhko 
periods, which results in a Blazhko super period of 
373.6 days. 

This  value  corresponds  to  the  period  in  the 
Blazhko (O–C) vs. Vmax diagram, which manifests 
itself  e.g.  through  the  observed  change  of  the 
direction  of  rotation  halfway  through  the  period. 
With  the  same  period,  the  line  of  apsides  rotates 
and  the  eccentricity  of  the  (open)  ellipse  changes. 
The change of the direction of rotation takes place 
when the ellipse is transformed to a straight line. 

I maintain a critical view regarding the differences 
between  the  Blazhko  periods  derived  from  (O–C) 
and Vmax. A physical explanation of this phenome-
non  is  lacking,  which  also  holds  true  for  the 
Blazhko effect in general. 

As  is  the  case  for  other  RR  Lyrae  stars,  the 
positions  of  the  maxima  in  the  (O–C)  vs.  Vmax 
diagram  for  AR  Herculis  should  describe  an 
ellipsoidal  curve,  with  the  direction  of  rotation 
changing  after  about  half  a  year.  However,  a 
conceivable  ellipse  is  present  only  in  a  single  time 
segment  of  100  days.  Clearly,  further  studies  are 
necessary in this respect. 

In  order  to  shed  more  light  on  this  phenomenon, 
as  many  maxima  as  possible  (N>50)  need  to  be 
observed  during  a  three-month  period.  In  doing 
so,  it  is  important  to  exactly  determine  date  and 
brightness of the observations. 

From  the  determination  of  at  least  100  maxima 
during  the  course  of  a  year,  a  statement  could  be 
made on the eccentricity, the rotation of the line of 
apsides, and the direction of rotation.
