Abstract 

The  conduction  band  structure  in  methylammonium  lead  iodide  (CH3NH3PbI3) 

was  studied  both  by  angle-resolved  two-photon  photoemission  spectroscopy  (AR-

2PPE) with low-photon intensity and angle-resolved low-energy inverse photoelectron 

spectroscopy (AR-LEIPS). Clear energy dispersion of the conduction band along the 

ΓM direction was observed by these independent methods under different temperatures, 

and the dispersion was found to be consistent with band calculations under the cubic 

phase.  The  effective  mass  of  the  electrons  at  the  Γ  point  was  estimated  to  be 

(0.20±0.05)m0 at 90 K. The observed energy position was largely different between the 

AR-LEIPS and AR-2PPE, demonstrating the electron correlation effects on the band 

structures. The present results also indicate that the surface structure in CH3NH3PbI3 

provides the cubic-dominated electronic property even at lower temperatures.

In the past few years, methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3)-based organic-

inorganic  hybrid  halide  perovskite  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  most  promising 

photovoltaic absorbers due to its high-light absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime 

and diffusion length, low exciton binding energy, and easy fabrication. [1-5] Compared 

with  the  development  of  device  performance,  the  fundamental  understanding  in 

CH3NH3PbI3 remains a subject of debate, [6-9] with several  controversial points are 

still existing and waiting for urgent clarifications. In particular, experimental evidence 

for  the  occupied  and  unoccupied  electronic  states,  which  dominates  device 

performances, is still not fully revealed. Very recently, Yang et al. [10] and Zu et al. [11] 

successfully reported the valence band (VB) structure for CH3NH3PbI3 by using angle-

resolved ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (ARUPS), but the interpretation of the 

scanning  direction  in  the  Brillouin  zone  is  controversial.  In  addition,  temperature-

induced gradual phase transitions have been confirmed either at the surface or in bulk, 

but there is an inconsistency of the observed top VB dispersion compared with surface 

structures. [10, 12] In order to further address these controversies, one effective way is 

to measure the electronic structures of the conduction band (CB), since the calculated 

band  structure  has  directly  indicated  the  different  dispersive  relations  to  the  VB  at 

various momentum spaces. To our best knowledge, no study on the CB structure of a 

CH3NH3PbI3  single  crystal  exists so  far  because  the  thick  single  crystals  commonly 

studied exhibit charging/damaging upon laser irradiation or electron bombardment [13, 

14,  15].  For  probing  the  electronic  structure  of  the  CB,  angle-resolved  two-photon 

photoemission  spectroscopy  (AR-2PPE)  and  angle-resolved  inverse  photoelectron 

3 

 
spectroscopy  (AR-IPES)  are  establised  techniques;  while  AR-2PPE  observes  the 

conduction band with excitons, [16 17, 18], AR-IPES examines the conduction band 

with occupied anions. [19, 20] (More details can be found in Methods) However, the 

serious  sample-damage  and 

low  energy  resolution  have  prevented 

the  CB 

measurements of CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal using AR-IPES. These issues have been 

solved  by  lowering  the  electron  and  photon  energies  in  low-energy  inverse 

photoelectron spectroscopy (LEIPS). [21, 22] Recently, a new version of LEIPS having 

the  angular  resolution  called  angle-resolved  low  energy  inverse  photoelectron 

spectroscopy (AR-LEIPS) has been developed at Chiba University, which enables the 

CB measurement of CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals. 

In the present work, we have measured the CB dispersions of cleaved CH3NH3PbI3 

single crystals by either using low-photon fluxes for 2PPE or low-current density for 

LEIPS  to  overcome  the  sample  charging  and  damaging.  This  has  enabled  us  to 

accurately  determine  the  dispersion  relations  along  with  defined  crystallographic 

directions  with  different  substrate  temperatures,  where  the  surface  structure  and  the 

effective mass of electron can be quantitatively obtained. Moreover, the spectroscopic 

findings  given  by  the  different  initial/final  states  demonstrate  the  impacts  of  charge 

relaxation processes on the electronic states, which offer to unveil a peculiar property 

of the hybrid perovskite materials, that is a long carrier lifetime. 

Fig. 1 (a) depicts angle-integrated 2PPE spectra acquired at the normal-emission 

geometry with photon energy dependences measured at room temperature (300 K) to 

assign the conduction band related features in CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal. The energies 

4 

 
of these peaks (marked by bars in Fig. 1(a)) plotted as a function of photon energy are 

also given in Fig. 1(b). Three different types of evolution in peak positions can be found 

in Fig. 1(a) (see also Fig. S1 to describe transition processes of 2PPE). (i) Four peak 

positions (marked with A, BL, BU, and C) align vertically due to the two-step excitation, 

indicating these peaks arose from conduction bands, namely the energy positions above 

EF of 1.21 eV (denoted as CB0), 1.82 eV (lower band: BL of CB1), 1.98 eV (upper band: 

BU of CB1), and 2.45 eV (CB2), respectively. (ii) Peak D shifts gradually to a higher E-

EF energy region with increasing photon energies. The shift changes linearly (as shown 

in Fig. 1(b)) with a slope of unity, indicating the peak is described from fixed valence 

band  at  2.00  eV  (VB0)  below  EF  via  direct  two-photon  absorption,  which  is  nearly 

consistent with UPS results (2.14 eV) by considering a different work function of the 

measured  sample  shown  in  Fig.  S2.  (iii)  Peak  E  shifts  oppositely  to  the  lower  E-EF 

energy region with increased photon energies. On the other hand, peak E can be well 

aligned once we put on the final energy of photoelectron with respect to EF, as shown 

in Fig. S3, which suggests the origin of peak E is unoccupied states above the vacuum 

level. [23, 24] The work function measured from 2PPE is 4.48 eV (Fig. S2), which is 

nearly consistent with the result of 4.57 eV measured from UPS. Although no in-situ 

cleaning procedure in UHV was applied to the single crystal surface, our observations 

from  2PPE  compared  with  results  from  UPS  give  us  the  direct  information  that  the 

sample is of high quality and excellent surface cleanness. [10] 

The conduction bands in the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal measured by AR-LEIPS 

at the normal incidence geometry for electrons with -5 V bias are also given in Fig. 1 

5 

 
(c), where the beam damage and surface charging are confirmed to be negligible (as 

shown in Fig. S4). The spectrum is consistent with the previous LEIPS spectra of the 

solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3 film. [25] The peak positions of spectral features of 

the CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal are given after fitting with Gaussian functions, where 

the energy positions of 1.70 eV (CB0), 2.34 eV (CB1), and 2.89 eV (CB2) above EF 

can be observed. Fig. 1 (d) summarizes the observed energy levels from 2PPE, LEIPS, 

and UPS (see Fig. S2). Importantly, the bottom energy position of the CB is different 

largely between the 2PPE (~1.2 eV) and LEIPS (~1.7 eV) to give the difference of 

about 0.5 eV [0.49 (±0.35) eV as described later]. Note that we do not discuss the shift 

of  other  CBs  because  of  unclear  spectral  features  in  LEIPS  and  overlapping  of  the 

features via other transitions in 2PPE. The band-gap energy at the  point is estimated 

quantitatively by using angle-resolved data as described later. It is essential to notice 

that  these  methods  involve  different  transition  processes  with  electrons:  2PPE 

measurement includes both two-photon absorption as to give a similar binding energy 

to the UPS and two-step excitation processes from an initial state to a final state via 

an unoccupied intermediate state whereas LEIPS measurement reflects a process with 

materials generating from neutral (an initial state) to an anion (a final state). [20, 26] 

Interestingly, we here obtain nearly the consistent energy positions of VB0 either from 

2PPE or UPS due to the coherent two-photon absorption process in 2PPE with this 

photon energy range, in which the photoemission process is similar to that in UPS. On 

the other hand, CB0 gives a clear energy difference of 0.49 (±0.35) eV by comparing 

these two methods (2PPE and LEIPS) due to the different  initial/final state probing 

6 

 
processes,  where  such  energy  difference  could  be  considered  as  a  half  of  on-site 

Coulomb energy if we assume in monitoring the band feature of upper Hubbard band 

in LEIPS. [20, 27]    However, the origin of the energy difference is not unambiguous 

for this class of materials where a charge couples strongly to phonons with a heavy 

carrier system, hence a general theoretical model should be extended. Importantly the 

observed band dispersions both VB and CB are different among these methods AR-

2PPE,  AR-LEIPS,  and  ARUPS  in  detail  as  described  later.  Note  that  the  observed 

features in 2PPE could be ascribed from lowest exciton dispersion instead of conduction 

band dispersion upon forming a one-hole/electron paired final state, however, we conclude 

the dispersion character is evaluated for the conduction band because there is negligible 

difference in the energy position for the exciton band dispersion due to the extremely small 

exciton binding energy (0.02~ 0.05 eV) of the material [8, 28, 29], hence we use ”CB” 

or ”VB” labels for the related spectral features in the manuscript. 

Figs. 2 (a) and (b) depict the photoelectron emission angle (θ) dependence of the 

AR-2PPE spectra of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal. They are acquired separately at two 

different temperatures (300 K and 90 K) along the ΓM high symmetry direction (see 

the inset of Fig. 3 (a) for the measured direction in real space). Upon changing the 

photon energy at 90 K in 2PPE (see Fig. S5), the resonant photoemission from VB0 to 

CB2 is observed at around hv of 4.6 eV to give a clear separation of the VB and CB 

bands for the spectra taken at the larger hv. Therefore, the acquired photon energy is 

set to 4.77 eV for AR-2PPE measurements to resolve each peak in a spectrum. Each 

spectrum in Figs. 2 (a) and (b) is obtained with an acceptance angle of Δθ = ±1° to 

7 

 
have a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Marked by a blue dash curve as a guide to the 

eye,  a  weak  peak-like,  energy-dispersive  feature  of  the  conduction  band  (CB0)  is 

visible in Fig. 2 (a), where CB0 is initially located at 1.36 eV (θ= -8°), then reduces to 

1.31 eV at normal emission (θ= 0°), and starts to increases to 1.40 eV at θ= 10°, with 

giving the total dispersion shift of ~0.1 eV. This dispersion of peak CB0 can be more 

clearly recognized at a lower temperature (90 K) in Fig. 2 (b). The CB0 shifts to the 

low-energy (E-EF) side overall and gives a larger dispersion than the 300 K results in 

Fig. 2 (a), where CB0 is initially located at 1.41 eV (θ= -8°), then reduces to 1.09 eV 

(θ= 0°) and again shifts back to 1.36 eV (θ= 10°), with giving the total dispersion width 

of ~0.3 eV. On the other hand, no meaningful dispersion is found at both temperatures 

for the peaks CB1. The dispersion relation of VB is differently observed between at 

300 K and 90 K, namely no shift at 300 K, while a clear shift against the angle at 90 

K.  First,  the  VB0  has  a  less  dispersion  in  this  momentum  range  as  reported  in  the 

ARUPS  taken  at  300  K  [10]  (also  see  Fig.  S2).  Second,  the  feature  is  affected  by 

overlapping the other CB features, like CB2 bands (peak C), though the features could 

be distinguished by measuring the photon-energy dependence as shown in Fig. 1 (300 

K) and Fig. S5 (90 K). Briefly, one can find some shoulder features around the peak 

VB0 in the given photon energy of 4.74 - 4.77 eV. Increasing the peak width of VB0 

close to the Γ region also demonstrates the effect of other bands overlapping (see Fig. 

S6),  hence  we  do  not  discuss  changes  in  the  dispersive  features  of  VB0  in  detail. 

Different behavior in each peak shift of CB0 and CB1 is confirmed as shown in the 

bottom  part  of  the  figures as  well. The  spectral  shift  to  the  low-energy  (E-EF)  side 

8 

 
when reducing the temperature is also consistent with the previous ARUPS results for 

the  VB  change  (seen  Fig.  S2  (b)  and  (c)),  suggesting  the  work  function  change  in 

CH3NH3PbI3 upon the cooling. This temperature-induced peak shift (VB0 and CB0) 

indicates negligible impacts on the band-gap energy, as it may originate from an “n-

type doping” behavior with pushing the Fermi level shift closer to the conduction band. 

  Incident angle (θ) dependence of AR-LEIPS spectra along the ΓM high symmetry 

direction  measured  under  two  different  temperatures  (300  K  and  170  K)  have  also 

been studied as shown in Figs. 2 (c) and (d). Again a clear band dispersion for the 

conduction band (CB0) is visible as shown in Fig. 2 (c). The peak CB0 is located at 

1.81 eV (θ = -8°), reaching the minimal position of 1.66 eV (θ= 0°), and then shifts to 

a higher kinetic  energy side with  an increase of  θ, reaching 2.19 eV at  θ=24°. The 

dispersion becomes even more apparent when the measured temperature reduces to 

170 K, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Upon the cooling, the peak CB0 is more prominent at 

θ= 0°, which shows a larger dispersion than the 300 K with a minimal position of 1.25 

eV and shifts to high-energy (E-EF) side with the angles locating either at 1.45 eV (θ= 

-8°) or 1.65 eV (θ= 32°). The overall positions of CB0 shift to the low-energy side 

upon the cooling due to work function change as found in 2PPE. The lower parts of 

Fig. 2 (c) and (d) demonstrate a direct comparison between two spectra recorded at 

two  different  angles  (θ=  0°  and  θ=  20°),  where  the  dispersion  of  CB0  is  directly 

confirmed.   

The  bottom  energy  position  of  the  concave  CB,  that  is    point,  is  different 

significantly between the 2PPE (1.31 eV) and LEIPS (1.70 eV) at 300 K. The band-

9 

 
gap energy at the Γ point is estimated quantitatively. It is 3.84 eV from AR-UPS and 

AR-LEIPS which is larger than that of 3.23 eV obtained from AR-2PPE at 300 K. The 

inconsistency in the estimated-gap energy by various techniques has been discussed 

by  considering  the  logarithm  photoelectron  spectra  [30]  and  the  band  dispersion 

structure [11]. Accordingly, here we suggest the impact of electronic correlation on the 

band positions additionally. Theoretical development is highly encouraged to discuss 

the  band  renormalization.  Note,  the  onset  energy  position  has  been  considered  to 

evaluate the band-gap energy in case of the sample has inhomogeneity in structure or 

consists of poly crystallites. Here we demonstrate in use the peak position instead of 

the onset position by momentum resolved data. 

Fig. 3 shows the second derivative map of the observed band dispersion along the 

ΓM  direction  plotted  as  a  function  of  the  parallel  component  of  the  electron  wave 

vector  k//  measured  by  AR-2PPE  at  90  K  (a)  and  AR-LEIPS  at  170  K  (b).  The 

calculated conduction band dispersion along the ΓM direction for a cubic phase (see 

Fig. S7) is also superimposed. The E-k dispersion maps taken at 300 K are shown in 

Fig.  S8. A  good agreement  is  obtained by comparing  experimental results with  the 

calculations in the conduction band region (CB0 and CB1). Moreover, combining with 

ARUPS results for VB dispersion (seen Fig. S2), the obtained CB's results strongly 

suggest  the  cubic-dominated  surface  structure  in  CH3NH3PbI3  even  at  lower 

temperatures, which also agrees well with our previous work. [31] Note that we observe 

phase transition of the crystal structure with varying the temperature, where a tetragonal 

phase becomes visible below 250 K in a diffraction study [10], indicating the bulk structural 

10 

 
properties are not dominant the surface electronic property. There is a controversy in the 

previous ARUPS reports [10, 11]; however, the concave shape of the band dispersion of 

CB0 at the Γ point further confirms the measured dispersive direction in momentum 

space is strictly following the ΓM direction [10] instead of the XR direction [11], where 

a convex band (CB0) should be found along the XR direction (see Fig. S7).   

Figs. 3 (c) and (d) depict E-k// relation of the conduction band (CB0) derived from 

AR-2PPE  and  AR-LEIPS  results  taken  at  lower  temperatures  (90  or  170  K).  The 

calculated band dispersion (CB0 with gray dash lines) is also superimposed in Fig. 3 

(c),  in  which  a  good  agreement  can  be  seen  in  these  two  spectra  measured  under 

different  temperatures  (see  also  Fig.  S8  for  300  K).  However,  in  detail,  the  band 

dispersion is getting weaker around the Γ point at 300 K and deviates largely from the 

calculation at the high-k region at 90 K for 2PPE. The large difference of the band 

dispersion feature found in AR-2PPE compared to ARUPS and AR-LEIPS is caused 

by a peculiar property  of hybrid  perovskite materials,  which is  the strong electron-

phonon coupling upon the exciton formation. [18] This is also supported why we can 

monitor 2PPE signals under the very low-laser power excitation, ten times weaker than 

a typical 2PPE experiment, which is realized by the nature of the long lifetime at the 

excited state. The deep insight into the lifetime is beyond the scope of this manuscript, 

and it is necessary to study time-dependent 2PPE experiments as feasible experiments 

in the future. 

Furthermore, in Fig. 3 (d) we use a parabolic function mainly near the Γ point of 

the experimental curves to obtain the effective masses of electrons from the parabolic 

11 

 
curvature according to the following equation: m* (k) = ħ2 × [∂2 E(k)/ ∂ k 2]-1, where 

m*(k), ħ, E(k) and k are the effective mass, reduced Planck's constant,  energy, and 

wave vector, respectively. It is found that the effective electron mass me* to be 0.20 

(±0.05) m0 and 0.38 (±0.10) m0 near the Γ point at 90 K by AR-2PPE and at 170 K by 

LEIPES, respectively, where m0 is the free-electron mass. It is similar to be 0.28 (±0.10) 

m0 and 0.39 (±0.10) m0 for 2PPE and LEIPS at 300 K within the experimental error 

(Fig.  S8).  The  larger  me*  of  0.38  (±0.10)  m0  in  the  LEIPS  could  suggest  the 

observation of the upper Hubbard band upon forming a charged anion state, though 

we  need  further  experiments  as  described  before  to  demonstrate  the  band 

renormalization.  As  a  feasible  experiment  in  the  future,  it  might  be  interesting  to 

discuss the lower Hubbard band by having missing experiments on the time- and hv-

dependent VB measurement with exciton formation in the 2PPE. Indeed the observed 

band shape in 2PPE assigned for VB0 is largely changed upon the cooling to 90 K, and 

is  different  entirely  from  the  theoretical  calculation  and  the  conventional  ARUPS 

results. 

In conclusion, we succeeded in observing the conduction band (CB0) dispersion of 

CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal near the Γ point utilizing AR-2PPE and AR-LEIPS for the 

first time, overcoming beam damage and surface charging. The energy difference of 

CB0 between AR-2PPE and AR-LEIPS indicates a half of the on-site Coulomb energy, 

which is estimated to be 0.49 (±0.35) eV. Moreover, a clear conduction band dispersion, 

consistent with the calculations from a cubic dominated surface structure, has been 

confirmed at different temperatures. Our results should further inspire the extensive 

12 

 
study of other types of hybrid perovskites to reveal conduction band structures related 

to orbital splitting [32] and phonon coupling effects. 

Methods 

CH3NH3PbI3  single  crystals  (~2×1×10  mm3)  were  grown  with  the  method 

proposed by A. Poglitsch and D. Weber. [33] Afterward, the crystal structure and bulk 

quality were initially studied using crystal-X-ray diffraction (MERCURY CCD-1・R-

AXIS  IV),  and  the  results  were  given  in  supplementary  material  (SM)  Table  S1. 

Measured  samples  were  obtained  by  cleaving  larger  single  crystals  in  an  room 

atmosphere  and  put  on  a  conductive  silver  paste  adhered  to  a  molybdenum  sample 

holder [10], where we used the cleaved fresh surface for the measurements.   

The UPS was performed using a high-sensitivity apparatus with a hemispherical 

electron energy analyzer (MBS A-1), monochromatic He Iα (hν = 21.22 eV) radiation 

source [10], where the resolution was set to 50 meV. A bias of -5 V was applied to the 

sample in order to detect the secondary cutoff electrons, whereas no bias for ARUPS 

measurements. The binding energy scale is referred to the Fermi level (EF) measured 

on a clean metal substrate. 

In AR-2PPE measurements with one-color irradiation for pump and probe photons, 

the p-polarized UV light was generated by frequency tripling the output of a titanium 

sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser operated at a repetition rate of 80 MHz and a pulse width of 110 fs. 

The resulting p-polarized light was focused on the sample surface with a concave mirror. 

The power of the laser light was set to ~0.0125 nJ/pulse at a repetition rate of 80 MHz, 

which  was  one  order  magnitude  less  than  that  used  for  conventional  2PPE 

13 

 
measurements. [17] As a result, no damage to the sample and spectral changes due to 

the charging was found during the 2PPE measurements. The experiments was carried 

out  in  a  home-built  apparatus  with  an  angle-resolved  hemispherical  energy  analyzer 

(R3000,  VG-Scienta,  the  emission  acceptance  angle  in  angle-resolved  and  angle-

integrated  mode  is  ±10°  and  30°,  respectively)  and  the  overall  energy  resolution 

including the bandwidth of the laser light was typically less than 20 meV. [34] All 2PPE 

measurements  were  acquired  with  a  sample  bias  of  -3V  to  collect  low-energy 

photoelectrons  effectively.  The  influence  of  adding  -3  V  bias  during  AR-2PPE 

measurements has also been carefully considered, results in the underestimation of m* 

with  a  value  of  ~25%  at  most,  especially  when  the  value  is  evaluated  far  from  the 

gamma point (see Fig. S9). [35, 36]   

In AR-LEIPS measurement, an electron beam with the kinetic energy in the range 

between 0 and 5 eV from an electron source was incident to the sample surface. The 

emitted  photons  were  collected  and  focused  by  a  elliptical  mirror  into  the  photon 

detector consisting of a bandpass filter and a photomultiplier tube. The photon energy 

detected was 4.82 eV. The overall energy resolution measured from the Fermi edge of 

a  polycrystalline  Ag  surface  was  350  meV.  No  bias  was  added  during  AR-LEIPS 

measurements  for  dispersions.  The  beam  damage  in  AR-LEIPS  has  been  carefully 

avoided by reducing the emission current and slightly changing the measured sample 

position.  The  low-energy  electron  beam  of  low-current  density  (1~5  A/cm2)  was 

irradiated on the sample to  give  a sample current  of ~50 nA typically. Although we 

performed  AR-LEIPS  and  2PPE  measurements  for  different  sample  crystals,  we 

14 

 
confirmed  that  these  samples  gave  the  same  VB  dispersions  observed  by  separate 

experiments using ARUPS.

Crystal X-ray diffraction measurement   

A small crystal of CH3NH3PbI3 having approximate dimensions of ~0.200 × 0.200 
× 0.200 mm was mounted on a glass fiber for single crystal X-ray characterization. The 
measurement  was  carried  out  on  a  Rigaku  Mercury70  diffractometer  using  graphite 
monochromated Mo-Ka  radiation  at  the  Instrument  Center of  Institute for Molecular 
Science. The crystal-to-detector distance was 35.04 mm. The data was collected at  a 
sample temperature of 350 ±0.5 K for CH3NH3PbI3 to a maximum 2θ value of 59.9°, 
which was then analyzed by using the software CrystalClear (Rigaku). Fitting of the 
data using a cubic unit cell for CH3NH3PbI3 yielded a total of 3564 reflections, in which 
284 were independent (completeness =92.03%). The result was summarized in Table 
S1.

peak E is well aligned with the final energy defined with respect to the  EF, and also 
aligned with the kinetic energy of photoelectron defined with  respect to the vacuum 
level.  This  means  the  origin  of  the  peak  E  is  an  unoccupied  state  located  above  the 
vacuum  level  (see  also  Fig.  S1).  The  final  energy  above  EF  is  defined  as  (E-EF)  + 
(photon energy).

respectively. The first (n=1) and second (n=2) members of image potential states (IPS) 
were observed. Without additional electric field in (a), IPS (n=1 and 2) showed nearly 
free-electron-like momentum-energy dispersions with effective masses of m*/m0 of ~ 
1.0,  where  m0  indicates  the  electron  rest  mass.  The  results  were  in  agreement  with 
previous studies [1-4]. Under the case with a sample bias of -3V in (b), the effective 
mass values were underestimated about 25% at most. The deviation is larger when the 
value is evaluated away from the gamma point (, i.e., |k//| > 0.2 Å-1). In this study, the 
effective  mass  values  are  evaluated  in  the  region  of  |k//|  <  0.15  Å-1,  and  thus  we 
concluded  that  the  estimated  maximum  deviations  are  compiled  in  the  experimental 
errors shown in the main text.
