ABSTRACT

Following the success of the ﬁrst mission, the High-Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) was launched for a
third time (Hi-C 2.1) on 29th May 2018 from the White Sands Missile Range, NM, USA. On this occasion,
329 seconds of 17.2 nm data of target active region AR 12712 was captured with a cadence of ≈ 4 s, and a
plate scale of 0.129 (cid:48)(cid:48)pixel. Using data captured by Hi-C 2.1 and co-aligned observations from SDO/AIA 17.1
nm we investigate the widths of 49 coronal strands. We search for evidence of substructure within the strands
that is not detected by AIA, and further consider whether these strands are fully resolved by Hi-C 2.1. With
the aid of Multi-Scale Gaussian Normalization (MGN), strands from a region of low-emission that can only be
visualized against the contrast of the darker, underlying moss are studied. A comparison is made between these
low-emission strands with those from regions of higher emission within the target active region. It is found
that Hi-C 2.1 can resolve individual strands as small as ≈ 202 km, though more typical strands widths seen
are ≈ 513 km. For coronal strands within the region of low-emission, the most likely width is signiﬁcantly
narrower than the high-emission strands at ≈ 388 km. This places the low-emission coronal strands beneath the
resolving capabilities of SDO/AIA, highlighting the need of a permanent solar observatory with the resolving
power of Hi-C.

1. INTRODUCTION
On the 11th July 2012 the NASA sounding rocket, Hi-C was ﬁrst-launched and captured high resolution (≈ 0.3 − 0.4 (cid:48)(cid:48)),
high-cadence (≈ 5 s) images of active region 11520 (Kobayashi et al. 2014) in a narrowband 19.3 nm channel. The unprece-
dented capabilities of this instrument allowed the corona to be viewed in greater detail than previously capable by space-borne
instruments, e.g. SDO/AIA (1.5 (cid:48)(cid:48), 12 s; Lemen et al. 2012) and SoHO/EIT (5 (cid:48)(cid:48), 12 min; Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995). Studies
on the data obtained during the maiden ﬂight of Hi-C revealed new information of the small-scale structures in the corona and
transition region. Several publications have resulted from those ﬁve minutes of observations, including energy release along
braided structures (Cirtain et al. 2013; Thalmann et al. 2014; Tiwari et al. 2014; Pontin et al. 2017), possible nanoﬂare heating in
active region moss (Testa et al. 2013; Winebarger et al. 2013), coronal loop structure (Peter et al. 2013; Barczynski et al. 2017;
Aschwanden & Peter 2017), and counter-streaming along ﬁlament-channels (Alexander et al. 2013).

Coronal loops form one of the basic building blocks of the corona as they exist in both the quiet Sun and in active regions.
Observational investigation of their structure has existed since the 1940s (Bray et al. 1991) with the loops viewed in EUV and
X-ray channels. For active regions, there are two loop types that have predominantly been studied: the short, hot loops in an
active region core, typically observed in X-rays, and the cooler, longer loops that surround the core, typically observed in EUV
(Reale 2010). EUV loops are observed to evolve and cool. They are relatively steady over periods of several hours (Antiochos et
al. 2003; Warren et al. 2010, 2011). In comparison, active region core loops are hotter, shorter and found in strong magnetic ﬁeld
areas within an active region (Berger et al. 1999). Typically, coronal loops have lengths of the same order as the barometric scale
height, though there are suggestions of miniature loops in the chromosphere which span just a single granule (Feldman 1983;
Peter et al. 2013; Barczynski et al. 2017).

When studying the heating of coronal loops, one of the most important factors for consideration is whether the observed loop
structure is isothermal or multi-thermal along the line of sight. If an observed loop is isothermal, it could indicate that the loop
structure is being resolved by the imager/spectrometer, or, if there is substructure below the instrumental resolving limit, that the
strands making up the loop are behaving coherently. Similarly, if a loop with no apparent structuring was observed to be multi-
thermal then this could be a clear indicator that the loop consists of unresolved strands or that there us many other structures
over a range of temperature along the line of sight. Thus, determining any resolved fundamental spatial scale or the presence of
sub-elements within a loop is an important step in addressing how coronal loop (or strand) plasma is possibly being heated.

In an attempt to answer this fundamental question, Schmelz et al. (2001) constructed multi-thermal DEMs using SoHO/CDS
and Yohkoh/SXT. The obtained temperature distributions were found to be inconsistent with isothermal plasma, both along the
line of sight and the length of the loop. The advent of TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer; Handy et al. 1999),
yielded more observations on the temperature proﬁles of coronal loops (Schmelz 2002; Winebarger et al. 2002, 2003; Cirtain
et al. 2007; Schmelz et al. 2009; Tripathi et al. 2009). Work by Mulu-Moore et al. (2011) investigate eight active region loops
that were previously found to be isothermal (Aschwanden & Nightingale 2005). Using the cooling-time to loop-lifetime ratio
during the rising and decaying phases of the loops, they deduce that observed lifetimes are longer than expected for seven of the
loops, suggesting the loops comprise of sub-resolution strands and that many TRACE loops are actually unresolved. Warren et
al. (2002) demonstrate that an impulsively heated loop bundle cools through the TRACE passbands, proposing each strand could
appear as a single, long-lived loop with ﬂat 19.5/17.1 nm ﬁlter ratios due to the sequential heating of the strands. They argue the
model could reproduce observed downﬂows (Winebarger et al. 2002) and broad DEM distribution along the loops (Schmelz et
al. 2001). Similarly, other models have investigated the many-stranded nature of coronal loops and the impulsive heating through
nanoﬂare events (Cargill & Klimchuk 2004; Sarkar & Walsh 2008, 2009; Taroyan et al. 2011; Price & Taroyan 2015).

More recently, high-resolution observations from instruments such as Hi-C and IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph;
De Pontieu et al. 2014) have weighed-in on the discussion of loop widths. For small loops (length < 1 Mm) Peter et al. (2013)
ﬁnd widths below 200 km, compared to 1450-2175 km for loops longer than 50 Mm, with no obvious signs of substructure
present in the Hi-C data when compared with AIA. From this Peter et al. (2013) deduce that sub-resolution strands would have to
be of the order 15 km wide or smaller for a 1500 km wide loop whose density and temperature vary smoothly across the structure.
Brooks et al. (2013) investigate 91 coronal loops and suggest they are often structured at a scale of several hundred km, ranging
between 212 km - 2291 km, with the most frequent occurring FWHM ≈ 640 km.

Further work on this by Brooks et al. (2016) combines IRIS observations and HYDRAD modelling (Bradshaw & Cargill 2013)
to investigate 108 transition region loops whose FWHM ranges between 266-386 km, arguing that at these spatial scales the
structures appear to be composed of monolithic stands rather than composed of multi-stranded bundles.

Similarly, Aschwanden & Peter (2017) combine Monte Carlo simulations of EUV images with the OCCULT-2 loop detection
algorithm on the ﬁrst Hi-C data-set. They ﬁnd a most frequent distribution of ≈550 km for 105 loop width measurements. From
this, Aschwanden & Peter (2017) deduce that Hi-C is fully resolving the loop structures. However, when they compare the
co-spatial results from AIA they ﬁnd that AIA can only partially resolve loops (cid:38) 420 km.

The advancements made by high-resolution measurements of coronal loops, particularly by Brooks et al. (2016) and Aschwan-
den & Peter (2017) appear to highlight evidence that current instrumentation is at a stage of resolving individual plasma strands
within the corona and hence provides some possible constraint on the heat input required for these features. A summary of
coronal loop width measurements can be found in §5.4.4 of Aschwanden (2004) along with a table of widths from 52 studies in
Aschwanden & Peter (2017).

This paper undertakes a further examination of loop or strand widths but employs the new data-set obtained from the ﬂight of
Hi-C 2.1 (§2). Using this unique data-set, we ask if Hi-C 2.1 is resolving individual coronal strands and what are their spatial
scales? To answer this, ﬁve regions are investigated from the target active region AR 12712 observed with both Hi-C 2.1 and AIA
171. From these ﬁve regions, fourteen cross-section slices are taken which intersect perpendicular to observed coronal strands.

Four of these slices are taken from a region of comparative low-emission (§3.1) compared to ten slices taken from four regions of
much higher observed emission (§3.2). In §3.3, the widths of the coronal strands are then determined and compared to previous
high-resolution ﬁndings while the conclusions arising from these results are discussed in §4.

2. HI-C 2.1 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
On 29th May 2018 at 18:54 UT, Hi-C was successfully relaunched from the White Sands Missile Range, NM, USA, capturing
high-resolution data (2k×2k pixels; 4.4(cid:48) × 4.4(cid:48) ﬁeld of view) of target active region AR 12712. This was the third ﬂight for the
Hi-C instrument; the second ﬂight was nominal but the instrument suffered from a shutter malfunction such that no data was
captured. For this reason, the mission reported upon here is named Hi-C 2.1. Unlike the ﬁrst mission that captured Extreme
Ultra-Violet (EUV) images in the narrowband 19.3 nm channel (dominated by Fe XII emission ≈ 1.5 MK), this mission focuses
on EUV emission of wavelength 17.2 nm (dominated by Fe IX emission ≈ 0.8 MK), which has a similar temperature response
to the AIA 171 passband. Hi-C 2.1 has a plate scale of 0.129(cid:48)(cid:48), and captured 78 images with a 2s exposure time and a 4.4s
cadence between 18:56 and 19:02 UT. During the Hi-C 2.1 ﬂight, the instrument experienced a pointing instability resulting in
periodic jitter in the dataset. This jitter caused motion blur and lower spatial resolution in approximately half of the data captured.
Furthermore, the data were further affected by the shadow of the mesh in the focal plane, reducing the intensity behind the mesh
by up to ≈ 35%. Full details on the Hi-C 2.1 instrument can be found in Rachmeler et al. (2019).

Figure 1. Left: Full disk image captured by AIA 171. The dashed-white lines indicate the target active region, AR12712. Middle: image for
AIA and right for Hi-C 2.1. The images have been averaged over the course of ≈60 s and sharpened using MGN. The middle panel indicates
the regions studied in this paper. The low-emission loops (red), large loops bundle (green), two open fan regions (blue), and central loops
bundle (black) are shown in more detail in Figures 4-8.

The goal of the analysis outlined here is i) from visual inspection determine a possible range of the structure observed in the Hi-
C 2.1 images and ii) to measure the full width half maximum (FWHM) of these detected strands. This work samples subsections
of the Hi-C 2.1 ﬁeld of view (FOV), for which the data is time-averaged over a period of ≈60 s for both AIA and Hi-C 2.1,
taking care to avoid the Hi-C 2.1 exposures impacted by the aforementioned jitter. This helps improve the signal-to-noise ratio,
particularly where the emission is low. Figure 1 shows the ﬁve regions from which fourteen cross-section slices are taken. Their
selection was predicated upon choosing locations where there is possible evidence of substructure or stranding within the loops,
whilst taking care to avoid ares in the Hi-C 2.1 ﬁeld of view where shadow of the mesh is clearly seen.

To assist in visualizing the ﬁnest structures in the Hi-C 2.1 data, we employ an image processing technique. EUV images of
the corona span a wide range of features and temperatures, from cooler, low-emission coronal holes, quiet Sun, and ﬁlament
channels, through to bright, hotter active regions. To account for the dominance of the bright features and reveal low-emission
structures often hidden in the data, Morgan & Druckm¨uller (2014) developed the Multi-scale Gaussian Normalisation (MGN)
technique for image processing. The method is based on localised normalisation over a range of spatial scales, and thus MGN
can reveal the ﬁne detail in the corona and structures in off-limb regions without introducing artifacts or bias. The technique is
commonly used in CME and stealth CME detection (Alzate & Morgan 2017; Hutton & Morgan 2017; Long et al. 2018), but is
also used in coronal loop studies (Chitta et al. 2017; Long et al. 2017).

WILLIAMS, WALSH, WINEBARGER (2019)

Due to the way MGN enhances peaks in low-emission plasma, and depresses them in high-emission plasma, the technique is
only employed in this work to improve the visual inspection of the AIA and Hi-C 2.1 data. If the FWHM calculations undertaken
in §3 are done on MGN processed data, it will lead to artiﬁcially narrowed(broadened) strands in low(high)-emission plasma.
Adapting the method outlined by Pant et al. (2015) in relation to the ﬁrst Hi-C mission, two low-frequency passband ﬁlters are
employed to both the original and MGN sharpened Hi-C 2.1 datasets to reduce the granular noise present.

In order to determine the widths of the structures, we extract the Hi-C 2.1 and AIA intensity along slices inside each sub-region;
an example intensity proﬁle is shown in the left panel of Figure 2. To further increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the slices in Hi-C
2.1 and AIA are taken to be 3 pixels wide; the intensity is then averaged over these pixels. The slices are taken perpendicular to
the strand cross-section in order to obtain accurate measurements of the strand widths. The slice locations and averaged intensities
in AIA and Hi-C 2.1 are given in Figures 4-8 in the ﬁrst and second columns, respectively. After ﬁnding the average intensity
along each slice, the global trend is removed by ﬁnding all the local minima of a slice (shown in Figure 2 as red asterisks), and
interpolating through these values. The resulting trend is then subtracted from the intensity proﬁle of the slice, leaving behind the
variations, i.e. the coronal strands, seen in the right panel of Figure 2 and the third columns of Figures 4-8. The base locations of
the isolated coronal strands are determined as the inﬂection points, and the maximum value between the two inﬂection points is
taken as the maxima of each strand. From these two values, the half-maximum value is determined and their locations are used to
determine the FWHM of each structure analysed (orange dashed lines in Figure 2). These FWHM values are used as a possible
determination of the coronal strand widths, which are then compared to previous high-resolution studies.

The uncertainty in the intensity for the cross-sectional slices is determined by ∆I =

I. If the slice under consideration is
from a region where the intensity is low, ∆I will correspond to a larger proportion of the intensity than a slice from a region of
greater intensity. In some instances, such as slice 10 (Figure 6), the magnitude of ∆I appears to increase once the background
subtraction has occurred (variation slice 10). This is merely a consequence of the background emission being large relative to the
local intensity of the coronal strands itself. Re-normalising the background subtracted slices has the effect of focusing in on the
structures themselves, which thus means that ∆I will appear larger.

√

Figure 2. A sub-section of Hi-C 2.1 intensity slice 10 (Left) is shown here to demonstrate the background removal process from the cross-
section slices analysed. The red asterisks denote the locations through which we interpolate to obtain the global background. Right: The same
Hi-C 2.1 intensity proﬁle with the global background having been deducted. The blue and green asterisks denote the base and maximum values
used to determine the height of the peak. The half-maximum is then determined as the midpoint between these two values and is used to
determine the FWHM (dashed orange lines).

In this study cross-sectional proﬁles are taken from structures observed within ﬁve regions, whose positions in the AIA and
Hi-C 2.1 FOV are indicated in Figure 1. Table 1 indicates the average emission for all ﬁve regions investigated during the ≈ 60s
for which the data is time-averaged. As is seen in Table 1, the average emission of Region A is at least an order of magnitude
lower than the other locations investigated within AR 12712. For this reason, the study is split into two parts in what we term in

low-emission loops are shown in more detail in Figure 4, whilst the high-emission regions include a selection of loops; large
loops (Figure 5), open fan loop regions (Figures 6 & 7), and some small loops close to the centre of the active region (Figure 8).

Figure 3 shows the the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld for the Hi-C 2.1 FOV
and the surrounding area. The snapshot shown here is taken at 18:56:15 UT, which corresponds to the ≈ 60 s period under
examination with Hi-C 2.1 and AIA. From this it can be seen that AR 12712 resides above a diffuse bipolar region.

The closed magnetic loops under investigation in regions B and E very clearly have their foot-points rooted in the areas of
opposite polarity, likely crossing over the active region’s polarity inversion line. The open fan loops observed in regions C and
D originate from areas of opposite polarity. The low-emission strands observed in region A have one footpoint in the area of
positive polarity but their negative polarity footpoint lies outside of the Hi-C 2.1 ﬁeld of view. However, these low emission
strands are still an integral part of the overall active region itself.

The strands in region A are low-density, and subsequently low-emission. However, due to their location and ideal viewing
angle placing them away from the core of the active region, these strands can be observed in a more isolated manner, helping us
to determine their widths. The coronal magnetic ﬁeld is often considered to be force-free in 3D simulations (Aschwanden 2019
and references therein), which implies that current density scales with the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Figure 1 in Gudiksen & Nordlund
2002). One may expect where current density is larger for the heating to be greater, and subsequently the emission to be higher.
For these reasons, the study is separated into low-emission (§3.1) and high-emission (§3.2) regions.

3.1. Low-Emission Loops

Given the way that MGN normalises a range of emission, ﬁgure 4 indicates visually the ﬁne-scale structure that is present even
in regions which may initially appear to be beneath the detection threshold. The top left panel shows the MGN sharpened AIA
time-averaged data, and the bottom left panel shows the corresponding MGN sharpened Hi-C 2.1 image. From these two images,
it can be seen that AIA does not have the resolution to differentiate some of the lower density, low-emission strands above the
background corona and instrumental noise. Hi-C 2.1 on the other hand, performs much better with several, low-density strands
being observably distinguishable.

Four data slices are taken across Region A (numbered 1-4 in Figure 4) and the normalised emission intensity along each slice
is compared for Hi-C 2.1 and AIA. Each intensity proﬁle is plotted from south to north. Slices 1 and 2 show good agreement
between Hi-C 2.1 and AIA, particularly with the broader structure centred around 9(cid:48)(cid:48). However, there are signs of the structure
consisting of more than a single strand in Hi-C 2.1 due to the irregular shape. South of this in slice 2 there is a single strand in
the AIA data (2(cid:48)(cid:48) − 6.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) but in Hi-C 2.1 there is evidence of three coronal strands, which trace the same envelope resolved by
AIA. These Hi-C 2.1 structures have FWHM between 345 − 396 km, which is beneath the width of a single AIA pixel.

The difference between the two instruments becomes more apparent in slices 3 and 4. In the MGN sharpened images, it can
be seen in the southernmost part of the slices that there are three distinct strands for Hi-C 2.1 and one to two strands in the
corresponding AIA envelope. However, in the time-averaged slices for the non-MGN processed Hi-C 2.1 data, only two peaks
can be seen in slice 3 (between 5(cid:48)(cid:48)- 12(cid:48)(cid:48)) and one peak in slice 4 (3(cid:48)(cid:48)- 11(cid:48)(cid:48)). This arises due to the way in which MGN normalizes
and enhances over a range of spatial scales and thus cannot be employed for direct data analysis in this study.

Further north of this large envelope (12(cid:48)(cid:48) − 25(cid:48)(cid:48)), it can be seen that there is plasma detected by AIA, but this is noisy with no
structure being resolved. This can be seen in the time-averaged slices as the normalised intensity value is between ≈ 0.85 − 0.95
but no individual peaks can be identiﬁed that are above the error bars. For Hi-C 2.1 however, there are multiple strands resolved
in this region, with ﬁve strands resolved between 14(cid:48)(cid:48) − 25(cid:48)(cid:48) in slice 3 , and eight strands between 11(cid:48)(cid:48) − 24(cid:48)(cid:48) in slice 4.

3.2. High-Emission Measure Loops

In this subsection results from investigations of ten cross-sectional slices in the high-emission loop regions (B-E in Figure 1)
are presented in the same manner as the low-emission loops discussed in §3.1. Again, the normalised intensity proﬁles are plotted
but left-to-right orientation now corresponds to west-to-east in the respective AIA and Hi-C 2.1 images (Figures 5 - 8).

The cross-sectional slices typically show similar intensity proﬁles for Hi-C 2.1 and AIA, with many structures being nearly
identical. In particular, slices 7 (Figure 5), 8 & 10 (Figure 6), and 11 (Figure 7) display strikingly similar overall proﬁles in Hi-C
2.1 and AIA. The only appreciable differences seen in slices 7 (7(cid:48)(cid:48)-12(cid:48)(cid:48)), 8 (17(cid:48)(cid:48)-23(cid:48)(cid:48)), and 10 (6(cid:48)(cid:48)-10(cid:48)(cid:48)) occur where single AIA
strands correspond to two Hi-C 2.1 strands, which have widths of 562 km & 1146 km in slice 7, 1333 km & 923 km in slice 8,
and 985 km & 556 km in slice 10, placing them approximately between one and three AIA pixel widths.

Similarly, there are also examples where although Hi-C 2.1 and AIA observe the same general structure, Hi-C 2.1 potentially
resolves more coronal structures along the length of the cross-sections, such as is seen in slices 5 & 6 (Figure 5), and slice
13 (Figure 8). In these three slices there is reduced commonality between the two instruments as the variations are increased
compared to the nearly identical cross-sections seen in slices 7, 8, 10, and 11. Focusing on slice 5, the time-averaged intensity
plots of both instruments appear to show agreement; however, the corresponding detrended proﬁle (variation plot 5 in Figure 5)

WILLIAMS, WALSH, WINEBARGER (2019)

reveals important differences. This can most notably be seen with the AIA structure centred at 5(cid:48)(cid:48) spanning between two Hi-C
2.1 strands. Further along slice 5, the AIA structure is double peaked, with the corresponding emission coming from two distinct
structures in Hi-C 2.1. Other examples can be seen in slices 6 (0(cid:48)(cid:48)-19(cid:48)(cid:48)) and 13 (1.5(cid:48)(cid:48)-4(cid:48)(cid:48) & 7(cid:48)(cid:48)-13(cid:48)(cid:48)).

It is slices 9, 12, and 14 that the difference in resolution, and subsequently resolving power of the two instruments is most
notable for the high-emission regions. Between slice position 0(cid:48)(cid:48)-8(cid:48)(cid:48)in slice 9 (Figure 6) there is a single, large structure in AIA,
which can be seen as two peaks in the time-averaged Hi-C 2.1 data. This double peak is evident in the corresponding MGN Hi-C
2.1 image, whilst in the MGN AIA image the structure still appears monolithic.

Closer inspection of the two Hi-C 2.1 structures (0(cid:48)(cid:48)-7(cid:48)(cid:48)) in the variation plot reveals that the ‘monolithic’ AIA structure could
actually be composed of four strands. This is because, whilst the detrended proﬁles of the Hi-C 2.1 structures are large, the peaks
of the two structures are actually comprised of two small-peaks, which are fully-resolved and above the error bars.

The next AIA structure in slice 9 also appears as a broad, mostly unresolved single feature being detected at position 19(cid:48)(cid:48).
However, in the corresponding Hi-C 2.1 data there are two strands. Similarly, for the rest of the slice, Hi-C 2.1 detects two more
strands; both indicating signs of possible substructure with faint double-peaks like the two aforementioned Hi-C 2.1 structures
(0(cid:48)(cid:48) − 7(cid:48)(cid:48)). This highlights that there is evidence for further substructuring beyond anything that Hi-C 2.1 can observe.

In slice 12 (Figure 7) we see one of the clearest examples where the increased resolving power of Hi-C 2.1 reveals strands
which AIA does not distinguish. The two large AIA features between 1(cid:48)(cid:48)-5(cid:48)(cid:48) and 5(cid:48)(cid:48)-9(cid:48)(cid:48)each correspond to three Hi-C 2.1 strands,
which have a mean width of 579 km. In Figure 8, slice 14 samples the cross-section of two strands which are relatively isolated
against the underlying moss region. The southern-most strand (≈ 0(cid:48)(cid:48) − 1.6(cid:48)(cid:48)) shows good agreement between Hi-C 2.1 and AIA
in the variation plot, though again there is a non-smooth, irregular distribution in the Hi-C 2.1 data hinting at unresolved coronal
strands. The northern-most strand (≈ 1.9(cid:48)(cid:48) − 3.7(cid:48)(cid:48)) is well deﬁned in Hi-C 2.1 with no obvious signs of substructure. However,
in AIA there is no structure/peak at this location. The corresponding MGN sharpened AIA image reveals that the strand fades
in-and-out of detection along its length, indicating this strand is at the detection threshold of AIA. This could mean that either
this is a low-emission strand, or the strand has a very narrow or precise temperature which is very close to the peak emission
temperature of Hi-C 2.1.

3.3. Strand Widths

A total of 25 and 49 strand widths are measured in the low-emission and high-emission regions, respectively. The appendix
contains two tables that index the widths and locations of all the strands measured by Hi-C 2.1 and AIA for the low-emission
(Table 2) and high-emission regions (Table 3).

However, as can be seen in slices 3 and 12, some of the structures are double-peaked. Consequently, these result from either the
presence of strands beneath the resolving power of Hi-C 2.1 or due to other coronal plasma somewhere else along the integrated
line-of-sight due to the plasma being optically thin. Measuring the widths of these structures could lead to an artiﬁcially broadened
distribution. Subsequently, analysis is undertaken with these double-peaked structures discarded from this survey, hence leaving
19 low-emission strands and 30 high-emission strands for width analysis. Thus, the widths are collated into occurrence frequency
plots in Figure 9 for the low-emission strands and Figure 10 for the high-emission strands.

The Hi-C 2.1 occurrence frequency plot for the low-emission strand widths (Figure 9) reveals there are low-density, low-
emission strands on both ends of the spatial scale, with structures as small as ≈ 200 km, and as large as 1700 − 1950 km.
However, these broader structures have irregular intensity proﬁles (as mentioned in §3.1). Consequently, when only single-
peaked structures are considered, the broader strands are between 825 − 950 km, which is narrower than the most likely strand
width measured with AIA (950−1200 km). For Hi-C 2.1, the most likely strand width of the low-emission structures is 325−450
km, placing the structures at approximately the same width as an AIA pixel or smaller.

Figure 10 shows a similar distribution of strand widths for the four high-emission regions as is seen with the low-emission
region. Again, narrow strands ≈ 200 km wide are detected by Hi-C 2.1 though these are not as prevalent as in the low-emission
region despite a larger sample of structures being investigated. Additionally, broader strands with widths > 1000 km are observed
in the high-emission regions, with one strand in slice 11 (≈ 19(cid:48)(cid:48) − 24.6(cid:48)(cid:48)) exceeding a width of 2000 km. The most likely strand
width for single-peaked structures in the four high-emission regions is between 450 − 575 km. Considering the smallest partially
resolved structure by AIA (466 km) is larger than the average low-emission strand width resolved by Hi-C 2.1 (≈ 388 km), it
could be argued that these results, alongside those from the maiden ﬂight of Hi-C, provide compelling evidence for satellite-borne
instrumentation with the resolving power of at least Hi-C.

For AIA, the most likely strand width of the low-emission and high-emission regions are the same (≈ 1075 km) but for Hi-C
2.1 the low-emission strands are approximately 125 km narrower than those resolved in the high-emission region (≈ 388 km vs
≈ 513 km). It is worth noting that there is a greater proportion of the low-emission strands with widths between 200 − 325 km

in 125 km bins, whereas the AIA bin width is 250 km.

compared to the high-emission strands. Conversely, the high-emission strands often exhibit widths (cid:39) 1000 km, agreeing with
results from Peter et al. (2013), whilst the low-emission strand widths do not exceed 950 km in this study.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Continuing on from the success of Hi-C, Hi-C 2.1 reveals structures throughout and around its targeted active region
(AR 12712) in the 17.2 nm line that cannot be resolved by SDO/AIA. The work outlined here investigates ﬁve regions from
the Hi-C 2.1 FOV, one region of what could be considered low-emission and four regions of signiﬁcantly increased emission
(Figure 1).

In regard to Region A, although it could be argued that there are hints of faint structures that could be observed in the AIA
FOV, it is found that with Hi-C 2.1’s superior resolving power, this region is in fact ﬁlled with numerous low emitting, and hence
low-density strands. In AIA, these strands often appear as granular noise. A contributing factor to this is that these low-emission
strands are observed by Hi-C 2.1 to be of only ≈ 388 km in width, beneath the scale of a single AIA pixel.

In contrast, Regions B-E have higher emission structures with an average Hi-C 2.1 strand width of ≈ 513 km, placing them in
line with previous width measurements made using Hi-C (Brooks et al. 2013; Aschwanden & Peter 2017). As discussed in Peter
et al. (2013) with regards to miniature loops, the Hi-C 2.1 data reveals strand widths as small as 200 km in both the low-emission
and high-emission regions, though they appear to be more numerous in the low-emission area of the active region.

An intriguing result is outlined in the analysis of slice 14, which samples the cross-section of the closed active region loops
near the centre of the Hi-C 2.1 FOV. In the MGN sharpened AIA image (Figure 8), the northern-most strand sampled in slice
14 appears to fade in-and-out of AIA detection along its length. This suggests that the plasma contained within this structure
is at the sensitivity limit of AIA, even when advanced image processing techniques like MGN are employed. Either this is a
low-emission strand amongst the high-emission structures, or this may simply be due to the fact that AIA and Hi-C 2.1 observe
plasma at slightly different temperatures (17.1nm and 17.2nm emission).

The evidence for low-emission strands, which are very difﬁcult to observe with AIA but much better resolved and width
determined by Hi-C 2.1, strongly indicates that plasma threads with low-density but coronal temperature material are prevalent
throughout the corona. This may be a strong indicator of previously unresolved, but background heated corona that Hi-C 2.1 is
beginning to provide evidence for. However, even with the enhanced spatial resolution of Hi-C 2.1, it still appears that there are
structures which could not be fully resolved. Although this could be due to projection effects of the optically thin plasma viewed
along its line-of-sight, another possible scenario is that there are coronal strands with structural widths below even the resolving
power of Hi-C 2.1.

Slices 9 & 12 are good examples of this but there are hints of substructure above the observational error throughout all the slices
examined. Thus, it may be possible for an instrument of greater resolving power to discriminate between these features. Note that
by combining both FFT and Gaussian width analysis methods, Rachmeler et al. (2019) conclude that the Hi-C 2.1 resolution is
between 0.3 − 0.47(cid:48)(cid:48) (≈ 220 − 340 km) in images that are not affected by motion blur. The most-likely strand widths obtained for
the low-emission strands (≈ 388 km) are above the resolution limit of Hi-C 2.1, indicating that at this increased spatial resolution
we may be beginning to have the opportunity resolve a fundamental width of individual coronal strands. This result agrees with
the results from Aschwanden & Peter (2017) though we note that there is building evidence that there are strands with widths
beneath the Hi-C 2.1 resolution.

Additionally, it may be argued that spatial structuring is only one part of the data required to address this question of basic
plasma stranding as the spread of observed temperature of these features is also critical. If the 17.2 nm Hi-C 2.1 structures that
are observed to be beneath the AIA resolution limit could also be observed in other passbands with similar spatial resolution to
Hi-C 2.1 and those observations then resulted in a broad temperature distribution of many strand-like features, then this could be
strong evidence for multi-thermal, many stranded models being the best way tackle coronal heating.

Future work will further examine the double-peaked structures by ﬁtting appropriate Gaussian proﬁles in order to estimate the
widths of the possible sub-resolution strands, as well as consider the examination of the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld structure
associated with low-emission strands alongside a comparison of the Hi-C 2.1 observations with speciﬁc active region modelling
(Warnecke & Peter 2019).

WILLIAMS, WALSH, WINEBARGER (2019)

In this appendix we present Tables 2 & 3. These show all the strands where FWHM calculations were possible. The widths
shown in bold with an asterisks denote strands which display obvious signs of sub-resolution and/or overlapping strands, and are
thus omitted from ﬁnal statistical analysis on the widths.
