Abstract 

Surrogate models for hotspot ignition and growth rates were presented in Part I, where the hotspots were 
formed by the collapse of single cylindrical voids. Such isolated cylindrical voids are idealizations of the 
void morphology  in  real meso-structures.  This  paper  therefore  investigates  the  effect  of  non-cylindrical 
void shapes and void-void interactions on hotspot ignition and growth. Surrogate models capturing these 
effects  are  constructed  using  a  Bayesian  Kriging  approach.  The  training  data  for  machine  learning  the 
surrogates are derived from reactive void collapse simulations spanning the parameter space of void aspect 
ratio  (AR),  void  orientation  (𝜃),  and  void  fraction  (𝜙).  The  resulting  surrogate  models  portray  strong 
dependence of the ignition and growth rates on void aspect ratio and orientation, particularly when they are 
oriented at acute angles with respect to the imposed shock. The surrogate models for void interaction effects 
show  significant  changes  in  hotspot  ignition  and  growth  rates  as the  void  fraction increases.  The  paper 
elucidates the physics of hotspot evolution in void fields due to the creation and interaction of multiple 
hotspots. The results from this work will be useful not only for constructing meso-informed macro-scale 
models of HMX, but also for understanding the physics of void-void interactions and sensitivity due to void 
shape and orientation.

INTRODUCTION 

Closure terms are required in macroscale models of the shock response of heterogeneous energetic (HE) 
materials to capture the effects of sub-grid meso-scale thermophysical phenomena  [1]. In calculations of 
shock to detonation transition (SDT) in HEs, these terms reflect energy localization at hotspots caused by 
void collapse or other mechanisms. In Sen et al. [2], a meso-informed multiscale model,  MES-IG, was 
developed in the ignition and growth framework; machine learned surrogate models were used to connect 
the  meso-  and  macro-scale  response  of  an  HE.  The  rate  of  energy  localization  due  to  hotspots  was 
transmitted through the surrogate models to close the macro-scale equations [2]. These surrogate models 
supplied the rates of hotspot ignition (𝐹̇&’(&)&*() and growth  (𝐹̇’+*,)-) as a function of the meso-structural 
parameters (void size) and loading (shock pressure and pulse duration).   Part I [3] and this work together 
describe the techniques to construct surrogate models.  While Part I [3] constructed the surrogate model for 
energy  localization  due  to  collapse  of  isolated  cylindrical  voids,  in  this  work  the  effects  of  void  shape 
variations and void-void interactions are quantified.

Importance of void shape and void-void interactions in energy localization 

A typical meso-structure for pressed HMX [4] is shown in  Figure 1 [5]. Clearly, the voids in the meso-
structure are far from cylindrical in shape and are also surrounded by other voids. Thus, the ignition and 
growth rates of a hotspot may not be adequately represented by 𝐹̇
. In fact, the deviations 
from cylindrical shape of voids, measured by the aspect ratio (𝐴𝑅) and orientation 𝜃, have been shown [6, 
7]  to  have    strong  effects  on  void  collapse  dynamics  and  the  resulting  hotspot  intensity  (size  and 
temperature). Simulations have also shown that  void-void interactions can lead to significant differences 
in  intensity of void collapse and the resulting hotspots in real meso-structures [8].

 and 𝐹̇

While the phenomenon of void collapse has been extensively studied via experiments [9-11] and numerical 
simulations [6, 8, 12-18], the focus has primarily been on ideal-shaped voids such as cylindrical, elliptical, 
conical, or spherical voids. There have only been a few published papers that have studied deviations from 
cylindrical shape. An  early work is Tran et al. [13], where inert calculations were performed on spherical 
and triangular/conical voids in HMX. They observed that the spherical voids produced a lower intensity 
hotspot when compared to the triangular void. Also, the triangular void with its apex pointed towards the 
shock wave generated a low intensity hotspot when compared to a triangle with its base pointing towards 
the incident shock. In more recent work, Levesque and Vitello [6] analyzed the effect of void morphology 
on the hotspot temperature for TATB using inert meso-scale simulations. They showed that elliptical and 
cylindrical voids aligned with the shock along their longest dimension (i.e. along the major axis for the 
elliptical void) produced higher intensity hotspots than a spherical void for the same shock strength and 
void fraction. Recently, reactive meso-scale simulations have also been employed to study the effect of 
void morphology on the sensitivity of energetic materials. Kapila et al. [16] performed reactive simulations 
on  three  different  void  shapes:  spherical,  prolate  spheroid  (long  void)  and  oblate spheroid  (tall  void)  in 
HMX. Among the three void shapes, the oblate spheroid was found to generate higher temperature hotspots 
that can lead to detonation. The recent work by Springer et al. [17] analyzed the effect of void morphology 
on the shock initiation and reaction rate in HMX. It was again shown that elliptical and conical voids of 
high aspect ratio led to increased sensitivity. Additionally, the effect of void morphology is shown to be 
dominant in the low shock pressure loading situations. In recent work, 3D reactive void collapse simulations 

 
on non-spherical voids were performed by Rai et al. [19]. They show that, for favorable void aspect ratios 
and orientations, the hotspot size, temperature and the resulting growth rate are enhanced significantly when 
compared with a corresponding idealized cylindrical void. In fact, the amplification of hotspot intensity is 
even  higher  for  three-dimensional  voids  [19]  due  to  3-dimensional  baroclinic  instabilities  leading  to 
enhanced mixing of reacted and unreacted material. The above studies show that closure models for energy 
localization at the meso-scale must take into account the effects of void shape.  

Voids in HEs are seldom found in isolation; the collapse of one void can affect the intensity of collapse of 
neighboring voids. This void-void interaction effect arises due to blast waves emanating from the point of 
collapse of one void or secondary waves reflected from neighboring voids. These effects were studied in 
the  case  of  void  collapse  in  an  inert  material  in  previous  work  [8].  It  was  observed  that  the  relative 
positioning of voids can affect the collapse temperatures and hotspot intensity of each of the voids in a 
cluster. There has been little previous work connecting meso-scale void-void interaction effects to macro-
scale HE sensitivity. In early work, Nichols and Tarver [20] accounted for meso-structural information in 
a  phenomenological reactive burn model base on a statistical distribution of hot spot sites To estimate the 
time  to  complete  reaction  for  a  spherical  hotspot  growing  outward,  their  calculations  assumed  that  the 
hotspot  diameter increased  to  eight times  its initial  value  [20].  By  this  measure,  only  small  particles  of 
HMX were found to react to completion.  For large particles or hotspot spacings, the time to consume the 
intervening material during the growth phase can be larger than the reaction zone and therefore do not fully 
contribute to detonation. In fact, Nichols and Tarver argue that the critical hotspot classification, which 
relies on diffusion and reaction alone as potential mechanisms for hotspot growth, yields growth rates that 
are rather low for the reaction zones. They suggest [20] that there must be some other mechanism involved 
in the growth phase that can accelerate the reaction front growth rate. Tarver and Nichols [20] argued that 
other mechanisms such as grain fracture could be responsible for the high rates of reaction expected, where 
fracture provides increased surface area for hotspot growth. A similar argument was made by Saurel and 
coworkers [21] in their work on multiscale modeling of SDT in plastic bonded explosives (PBX).  To match 
the experimental sensitivity response, as measured by pop-plots, Massoni et al. [22] enhanced the growth 
rate significantly by positing an interfacial amplification factor (IAF). The IAF depended exponentially on 
the pressure and led to rapid enhancement of the growth of reactions at higher pressures. Like Tarver and 
Nichols [20], increased fracture was assumed to be due to the high pressures and temperatures that arise 
during  shock  compression.  While  fracture  at  high  pressures  and  temperatures  as  well  as  void-void 
interactions  could  be  plausible  mechanisms  for  enhancing  the  growth  of  reaction  fronts,  our  current 
understanding  of  the  effectiveness  of  such  mechanisms  in  enhancing  heat  release  rates  in  HEs  remains 
incomplete. The present paper addresses the knowledge gap with regard to void-void interactions; damage 
and fragmentation of crystals is not considered in this work.

2  METHODS 

2.1  Numerical methods for solving governing equations and metamodel construction 

A  levelset-based  sharp  interface  Cartesian  grid  Eulerian  framework  is  used  to  perform  void  collapse 
simulations.  The  governing  equations,  along  with  material  and  reaction  models,  are  presented  in  the 
Appendix (Section 7). The governing equations apply to shock-induced deformation of HMX with voids 
in  the  solid  material  treated  as  vacuum.  The  condensed  phase  is  modeled  as  an  elastic-perfectly  plastic 
material  to  calculate  deviatoric  stresses,  with  a  Mie-Gruneisen  equation  state  for  pressure.    The  Tarver 
Nichols  3-equation  reactive  model  for  HMX  is  used  for  calculating  the  chemical  decomposition  and 
combustion of the material.  A detailed description of the overall framework is available from previous 
work [18, 19, 23-25]. 

The conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, along with the evolution of deviatoric stresses and 
species transport equations are spatially discretized using a 3rd order ENO scheme [26]. The time integration 
is  performed  using  a  3rd  order  Runge-Kutta  scheme.  Narrow-band  levelset  tracking  [27]  is  used  in  the 
current framework to sharply track the material interfaces. The levelset value denoted as 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑡) at a point 
is the signed normal distance from the interface boundary. The value of levelset, 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑡)is less than zero 
within the void regions and greater than zero outside the void regions. The interface is implicitly determined 
by  the  contour  𝜑(𝑥, 𝑡) = 0.  The  use  of  the  levelset  function  allows  handling  of  large  deformation  of 
interfaces that occurs during void collapse events. The interfacial conditions between the HMX and void  
are modeled by applying the free surface conditions at the interface using a modified ghost fluid method 
[28]. Detailed descriptions of the numerical algorithms, levelset implementation and interface treatment are 
provided in previous works [18, 19, 23-25]. 

Surrogate modeling is used to represent the hotspot ignition and growth rates, which are the quantities of 
interest (QoIs) that are supplied to macro-scale simulations in the ignition and growth framework. Surrogate 
modeling  involves  the  estimation  of  an  unknown  function,𝑓(𝒙),  based  on  input  data  at  a  sparse  set  of 
discrete and distinct points xj (j=1,…N). The set of the known values of the function and their locations, i.e. 
the set (xj), are the inputs for the surrogate model and are used to estimate the unknown function 𝑓(𝒙) in 
the parameter space. The point 𝒙G, where the value of 𝑓(𝒙) is of interest, is called the “probe point” of the 
surrogate  model,  while  the  value  of  the  function  at  the  probe  point,  𝑓(𝒙G),  is  called  the  output  of  the 
surrogate model. The modified Bayesian Kriging (MBKG) approach for constructing the function 𝑓(𝒙) 
given (xj) was shown in previous work [29-31] to be more efficient than other methods, such as neural 
networks [29, 32] and polynomial stochastic collocation[33], for model representation using limited input 
data sets. Therefore, the MBKG approach is used to learn surrogate models from a small ensemble of meso-
scale numerical experiments. Further details on the MBKG approach and machine-learning from meso-
scale simulations can be found in [3] and [30].

Note that, in general, the effects of void shape and void-void interactions cannot be decoupled from the 
effects of void size and shock loading. Therefore, Eqns. (1) and (2) reflect limitations of the current analysis, 
resulting from the assumption that void shape and void interaction effects are both orthogonal to each other 
and to the effects of loading and void size. This assumption is made in the interest of tractability as explained 
in Part  I  [3,  35].   Therefore,  the modifying  functions in  this  work  are  only  constructed  for  one  loading

2.2.1  Techniques for collecting data on void collapse-induced hotspot ignition and growth 
2.2.1.1  Defining a “representative” void 

As mentioned above, there are two distinct situations of interest in this work: 1) the ignition and growth of 
hotspots due to collapse of an isolated non-cylindrical void, and 2) the ignition and growth of hotspots due 
to collapse of a void embedded in a cluster of neighboring voids.  The simulation setup and details of data 
collection for these two situations are quite different, as illustrated in the computational setups shown in 
Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4. However, the analysis can be unified by adopting a framework common 
to  the  two  scenarios,  namely  a  “representative  void” viewpoint.  In  this  viewpoint,  we  calculate  hotspot 
quantities of interest (QoIs) resulting from the collapse of the representative void. For a single void system, 
whether cylindrical or elongated, the definition of a “representative” void is straightforward. For a void-
field, data is collected from individual control volumes enclosing the voids and then averaging over all the 
control volumes in the field to calculate the response of the “representative” void. The sensitivity of this 
representative void is then compared to that of an isolated single cylindrical void to quantify the effect of 
void shape and void-void interactions. 

2.2.1.2  Defining control volumes for collecting data on hotpots 

In all cases, several hotspot QoIs comprise the set ℚ. The procedure for extracting the set ℚ is described 
below for a single void and a field of voids. The control volume 𝑐𝑣 for the single void case shown in Figure 
2 and Figure 3 has length 𝑙01 on each side, the 𝑙01 values are provided in the respective figures. Similarly, 
for a void field, each individual control volume 𝑐𝑣 in Figure 5 has a length 𝑙01 and contains approximately 
one void per control volume, such that: 

𝑙01 = 	W

Y
𝜋	𝐷1*&7
4	𝜙

∗

𝑁1*&7/
𝑁01

 (3) 

 
where 𝐷1*&7 is the diameter of each of the 𝑁1*&7/ that make up the void volume fraction 𝜙 in the domain. 
Note that because the voids are arranged randomly in the domain it is likely that a control volume may not 
fully  enclose  a  void  at  all  times  or  in  some  situations  may  enclose  more  than  one  void.  The  averaging 
procedure described below for the field of voids takes account such contingencies. In the above, 𝑁01 is the 
total  number  of  non-overlapping  control  volumes  for  a  given  volume  fraction  𝜙.  For  simplicity  of 
constructing 𝐶𝑉, 𝑁1*&7/ = 𝑁01 and^𝑁01 is rounded to the nearest integer values. The length 𝐿‘a of the 
larger control volume 𝐶𝑉	enclosing the entire field of voids is therefore: 

𝐿‘a = 	𝑙01 × ^𝑁01 

 (4) 

Note that application of shock loading leads to the advection of the voids due to the particle velocity field 
following shock passage. To enclose all the voids throughout the computation, the larger control volume	𝐶𝑉  
(and thereby each 𝑐𝑣) is translated at a speed of 𝑉‘a in the direction of shock propagation. The speed 𝑉‘a 
at time instant 𝑡 is the average x-component of the velocity of the material within the control volume (𝑢d) 
and is given by: 

𝑉‘a(𝑡) =

∫
ijk
∫
ijk

𝜌(𝑡)	𝑢d(𝑡)	𝑑𝛺‘a

𝜌(𝑡)	𝑑𝛺‘a

 (5) 

where ρ is the local density. The individual control volumes	𝑐𝑣 therefore move along with the voids as they 
collapse  to  form  hotspots.  During  this  process,  ℚ  are  recorded  for  the  individual  control  volumes	𝑐𝑣 
numbered  𝑖01  (  1, … , 𝑁01)..  Other  averaged  field  quantities  are  also  calculated  in  similar  fashion.  For 
example, the total kinetic energy in a control volume is calculated as: 

𝐾𝐸	(𝑖01; 𝑡) =

1
2

s 𝜌(𝑥, 𝑡)	𝑢(𝑥, 𝑡)Y	𝛺01
itu

 (6) 

where 𝑢(𝑥, 𝑡)	is the particle velocity in the x-direction at location 𝑥 and time 𝑡 within the domain. The time 
instant of entry of a shock wave into the control volume is recorded as 𝜏/-&v)(𝑖01). 

𝜏/-&v)(𝑖01) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛	(𝑡)		such	that		∆𝐾𝐸	(𝑖01; 𝑡) > 0 

where ∆𝐾𝐸	(𝑖01; 𝑡) is the instantaneous rise of the kinetic energy: 

∆𝐾𝐸	(𝑖01; 𝑡) = 𝐾𝐸	(𝑖01; 𝑡) − 𝐾𝐸	(𝑖01; 𝑡 − ∆𝑡) 

 The shifted time 𝑡∗(𝑖01) for an individual control volume is defined as: 

𝑡∗(𝑖01) = 𝑡 − 𝜏/-&v)(𝑖01)

Note  that  for  the  single  control  volume  depicted  in  Figure  2  and  Figure  3,  𝑁01 = 1,  and  𝑉‘a = 0,  and 

𝜏/-&v) = 0. 

2.2.1.3  Hotspot 𝑄𝑜𝐼𝑠 

The  following  set ℚ  and  averaged  field  quantities  in  the  overall  control  volume CV  are  relevant  to the 
analysis presented in this work, and will be used to calculate the hotspot ignition and growth rates in Section 
2.2.3. 

1.  Reaction product fraction, 𝐹: The dynamics of void collapse leads to hotspots where HMX decomposes 
into  the   gaseous  reaction  products.  The  product  species  mass  fraction  is  denoted  by 𝑌(cid:132)(𝑥, 𝑡)  and  is 
evolved  using  the  conservation  equations  for  species  (Appendix,  Eq.  (33)).  The  rate  of  chemical 
decomposition of HMX within 𝑐𝑣 is calculated by accumulating the mass of the final gaseous products 
via: 

𝑀+<:0)<7(𝑖01; 𝑡) = s 𝜌(𝑥, 𝑡)	𝑌(cid:132)(𝑥, 𝑡)	𝑑𝛺01

𝑀+<:0)<7 is calculated for a control volume 𝑐𝑣 of area Ω01 = 𝑙01
Sen et al. [2], the reaction product fraction is the ratio, 

Y .  In line with Springer et al. [17] and 

𝐹	(𝑖01; 𝑡) =

2.  The rate of change of reaction product fraction, 𝐹̇ , is calculated as: 

𝐹̇ (𝑖01; 𝑡) =

Δ𝐹(𝑖01; 𝑡)
Δ𝑡	

 (12) 

where Δ𝐹 is the change in the gaseous product fraction 𝐹 over the time interval Δ𝑡	. In the MES-IG 
model [2] this reaction product formation rate is used in the ignition-and-growth  framework to quantify 
the consumption of HMX to product gases at the macroscale.  

3.  Hotspot area, 𝐴-/: A hotspot in this study is defined as the region with temperature greater than the bulk 

post-shock temperature. The hotspot area 𝐴-/ in each control volume at time  𝑡 is calculated as: 

𝐴-/(𝑖01; 𝑡) = s 𝜁(𝑥, 𝑡)𝑑𝛺01

𝜁(𝑥, 𝑡) is an indicator function that labels hotspot regions and is defined as:

 (13) 

 (14) 

	
 
 
 
 
 
	
 
 
𝑇(𝑥, 𝑡)  is  the  temperature  in  a  computational  cell  at time 𝑡  and 𝑇(cid:146)(cid:147)(cid:148)(cid:149)  is the  bulk  temperature  of  the 
domain after shock passage. The hotspot area fraction 𝐴(cid:151) -/ is the hotspot area 𝐴-/ per unit control volume 
area 𝛺01. 

𝐴(cid:151)-/(𝑖01; 𝑡) =

 (15) 

𝐴(cid:151) -/(𝑖01; 𝑡) reaches a maximum value of 1 when all the material within the control volume 𝑐𝑣 is above 
the bulk temperature. 

4.  The hotspot temperature, 𝑇-/, is the average temperature of the hotspot in the control volume: 

𝑇-/(𝑖01; 𝑡) =

5.  The void area,	𝐴1*&7, is obtained from:  

𝐴1*&7(𝑖01; 𝑡) = s 𝜉(𝑥, 𝑡)	𝑑𝛺01

where 𝜉(𝑥, 𝑡) is the indicator function distinguishing void regions using the levelset field:

and 𝜑(𝑥, 𝑡) is the levelset field value as defined in the Section 2.1.  

The hotspot QoIs in Eqs. (10-19)	are used to obtain the ignition and growth rates and analyze the behavior 
of  hotspots. ℚ(𝑖01; 𝑡∗) are then averaged over all the control volumes, as in Eq.  (19) below. This averaged 
QoI then applies to a representative void in the field of voids shown in Figure 3. For the case of a field of 
voids, spatially averaged quantities ℚ are obtained as follows:

Similar  to  the  calculation  for  a  single  cylindrical  void  [3,  17],  the  ignition  rate  𝐹̇&’(&)&*(|&tu  for  control 
volume 𝑖01 is obtained as the time rate of change of 𝐹 between points 1 and 2. Therefore:

The hotspot growth rate is calculated similarly as the time rate of change between points 3 and 4.  Thus

3.1.3  Physics of ignition of hot spots due to void shape effects 

From  Figure  7,  the  ignition  and  growth  rates  of  elongated  voids  are  observed  to  be  higher  than  the 
corresponding cylindrical voids for 0° < 𝜃 < 45° and 4 < 𝐴𝑅 < 22 [34]. To understand the physics in this 
range  of  𝜃  and  𝐴𝑅,    the  mechanism  of  collapse  and  hotspot  characteristics  such  as  shape,  size,  and 
temperature distributions for an elongated void (𝐴𝑅 = 22, 𝜃 = 15°),  are compared with a cylindrical void

Figure 9 shows the contour plots of vorticity, temperature, and final gaseous product mass fraction for both 
voids  after  collapse.  During  the  collapse  of  the  elongated  void  the  progressive  closure  of  the  void  by 
repeated pinching along its length leads to the formation, propagation, and self-strengthening of blast waves 
[7]. Therefore, collapse of the elongated voids progresses with increasing collapse temperature along the 
length of the void under the influence of self-strengthened blast waves. The repeated pinching also leads to 
the generation of high gradients of pressure and density across the void thickness. These gradients give rise 
to  the  formation  of  baroclinic  vortices,  as  can  be  seen  from  vorticity  contour  plots  of  Figure  9  (a). 
Comparison of Figure 9 (a) and (c) show high temperature regions at the core of the baroclinic vortices. 
This is also observed for cylindrical voids from Figure 9 (b) and (d), where the high temperature regions 
coincide with the high concentration of vorticity at the location of secondary lobe collapse [36]. For both 
the voids, in the high vorticity regions, mixing due to enhanced contact area of hot reacted material and the 
surrounding colder unreacted HMX lead to increased reaction rates and reaction completion. This can be 
seen from Figure 9 (e) and (f), where the contour plots of final reaction product show that the vortex cores 
are collocated with maximum reaction completion. The vorticity concentration for the elongated void is 
higher and mixing occurs all along the void surface, i.e. over a large surface area compared to the cylindrical 
void.  Therefore,  collapse  of  elongated  voids  with  self-strengthened  blast  waves,  high  vorticity 
concentration,  and  mixing  lead  to  enhanced  hotspot  ignition  rates  compared  to  cylindrical  voids.  The 
difference in the dynamics of void collapse behavior of elongated and cylindrical voids can lead to an order 
/-:;< (	𝐴𝑅, 𝜃	)  modifier 
of  magnitude  amplification  of  hotspot  ignition  rate,  which  is  reflected  in  the 𝑓&’(&)&*(
function as can be seen from Figure 7 (a) and (c). 

Once the collapse of voids has occurred, the rate of reaction front growth is dependent on the shape, size, 
and  temperature  of  the  hotspot.  An  estimate  of  the  hotspot  morphology  can  be  obtained  from  the 
temperature contours for both the cylindrical and elongated voids as shown in Figure 9 (a) and (b). The 
hotspot due to an elongated void reflects its original shape, leading to an enhanced burning front surface as 
can  be  seen  from  Figure 9  (b).  For  the  cylindrical void, the  hotspot  is  mushroom-shaped  with  the  high 
temperature region concentrated at the collapse locations of the two symmetrical lobes. The overall hotspot 
for the cylindrical void is more compact than that of the elongated void. Therefore, the larger burn surface 
area of the elongated hotspot relative to the more compact hotspot formed by the cylindrical void is expected 
to lead to a higher 𝐹̇’+*,)- for elongated voids. The relationship between the reaction growth rate, 𝐹̇’+*,)- 
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅, 𝜃)  and 
and  surface  area  of  the  hotspots  is  analyzed  further  by  comparing  the  variation  of  𝑓’+*,)-
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅, 𝜃) and the ratio of 
hotspot surface area of elongated voids with varying 𝐴𝑅. The variation of 𝑓’+*,)-
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅, 𝜃) 
hotspot surface area for the elongated and cylindrical void are shown in Figure 10. Both 𝑓’+*,)-

and burn surface area ratio increase with 𝐴𝑅 showing a direct relationship between the reaction growth 
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅, 𝜃) does not increase as strongly with 𝐴𝑅 
rates and the surface area of the voids. However, the 𝑓’+*,)-
as the hotspot surface area. Thus, the surface area ratio for the elongated void with 𝐴𝑅 = 22 is 2.76 while 
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅 = 22, 𝜃 = 15°) = 1.75. This is due to the vortical rollup shown in Figure 9 (d), where the 
the 𝑓’+*,)-
hotspot formed by the elongated void collapse has a larger burn front surface area than would be expected 
if the hotspot shape maintained the original cylindrical shape. 

In  summary,  void  shapes  that  deviate  from  the  idealized  cylindrical  shape  can  enhance  or  suppress  the 
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅, 𝜃)in Figure 7. The 
/-:;< (𝐴𝑅, 𝜃) and 𝑓’+*,)-
sensitivity of a porous HE, as indicated by the factors 𝑓&’(&)&*(
void shape has a stronger effect on the hotspot ignition rate than on the growth rate.

The rand function in MATLAB [37]  is used to place voids of specified diameter in the control volume CV. 
An additional criterion for the void placement is the minimum inter-void distance: no two voids are allowed 
to be closer than a specified minimum inter-void distance. An iterative procedure is used to obtain various 
arrangements until the highest possible value of the minimum inter-void distance is achieved for a specified 
𝜙. Arranging the voids through this criterion ensures the voids are distributed randomly but more or less 
homogenously throughout the sample. The effect of local variations in	𝜙, i.e. void clustering effects, are

3.2.1  Data collection and averaging for a field of voids  

The  process  of  collecting  data  from  the  moving  control  volume  and  calculating  averaged  quantities  is 
illustrated in Figure 4 for a void field with 𝜙 = 5%. The large control volume 𝐶𝑉 enclosing all the voids 
is sub-divided into 𝑁01 = 25 smaller control volumes with numbers 𝑖01 indicated in the top left corner of 
each control volume 𝑐𝑣.  

Figure 11 (a) shows the variation of total kinetic energy 𝐾𝐸	 with time (Eqn. (7)) for the centerline control 
volumes numbered 𝑖01= 11 to 15. Since the shock is applied at the left side of the domain, control volumes 
located further from the left boundary have higher values of 𝜏/-&v). The peak in 𝐾𝐸	 is highest for 𝑖01 = 11 
as it faces the imposed shock without any attenuation. The presence of voids and the traversal of the shock 
through the HMX matrix leads to attenuation of the shock wave for this value of 𝜙, thus the control volumes 
located further from the left boundary show lower peaks in 𝐾𝐸	.  

Figure 11 (b) shows the variation of hotspot temperature 𝑇-/ with time (Eqn. (16)) for the centerline control 
volumes. The peak in the hotspot temperature corresponds to the instant of void collapse as discussed in 
Part 1 [3]. The control volumes further away from the left face of the domain experience an attenuated 
shock for this value of 𝜙, and therefore show smaller peak values of 𝑇-/.  

Figure 11 (c) shows the variation in time of the averaged product mass fraction 𝐹 (Eqn.  (11)), which is a 
measure of the progress of chemical reactions for a particular control volume. The values of 𝐹 for control 
volumes 12 and 13 are larger than control volumes 14 and 15 because control volumes 14 and 15 are farther 

from the left face. Though control volume 11 is closest to the left side of the domain, 𝐹 and 𝑇-/ are low 
because the control volume contains only a partial void. Figure 11 (d) shows the variation of 𝐹 for the 
centerline control volumes as a function of the shifted time, which shows the curves for the different control 
volumes overlap. The black line in Figure 11 (d) shows the variation of the averaged quantity 𝐹(𝑡∗) with 
time, which is obtained using Eqn.  (19) by averaging the data over all the control volumes (𝑁01 = 25 for 
𝜙 = 5%).

fractions 𝜙 = {2%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 12%, 15%, 20%}. The void fraction 𝜙 has a significant effect on the 
ignition and growth rates. In general, void-void interaction effects lead to higher values of hotspot ignition 
and growth rates when compared to an isolated single cylindrical void, shown by the modifying functions

indicating slower hotspot growth rates compared to that of a single void. At 𝜙 = 2%, the attenuation of the 
lead shock wave as it passes through the void field leads to the formation of weaker hotspots at downstream 
voids. Furthermore, for 𝜙 = 2% the voids are far enough apart that the blast waves produced as neighboring 
(𝜙 = 20%) = 22.5

(𝜙 = 20%) = 2.25, indicating an increase in blast wave interactions at higher values of 𝜙, i.e.

hotspot formation and growth mechanisms is discussed.

3.2.3  Physics of void-void interactions: effect of blast waves from neighboring void collapses on hotspot 

growth rates  

To  elucidate  the  effects  of  void  volume  fraction  on  the  blast  wave  interactions,  a  comparison  is  made 
between  the  lowest  volume  fraction  of  𝜙 = 2%  and  the  highest  volume  fraction  of  𝜙 = 20%  for  the 
reference loading condition. Figure 13 shows the pressure and temperature contour plots for a sample with 
𝜙 = 2%  at  various  time  instants.  Figure  13  (a)  shows  the  pressure  at  early  time  where  the  shock  has 
propagated through the first few void fractions with no attenuation. The blast wave interacts with the lead 
shock front to form a Mach stem [12].  Figure 13 (b), shows that the temperature for the central void reaches 
3000K, which is above the bulk temperature of 500K in the shocked HMX. The blast waves from the void 
collapse do not have a significant effect on neighboring voids because the inter-void spacing is large (~ 
45	𝜇𝑚). The intensity of the circular blast waves produced by void collapse weakens rapidly as the waves 
spread  out  from the  point  of  collapse.  The large  void spacing  also  allows  for  rarefactions  to  counteract 
compression, shown in Figure 13 (c) as the shock is nearly through the void bed. For the same time, Figure 
13 (d) shows that the hotspots formed in the later (downstream) void collapse events are at temperatures 
close to 1500K. At the latest time considered, Figure 13 (e) shows the bulk pressure after the shock passes 
the entire domain ranges from 3 to 4 GPa. The lead shock is attenuated as it propagates through the porous 
material,  which  lowers  the  blast  wave  intensity  propagating  radially  from  the  points  of  collapse  or  by 
interactions with rarefactions. Therefore, the downstream voids result in weaker hotspots. 

For ϕ = 20% the physics of interaction of the reactive blast waves with the closely spaced voids is quite 
different, as seen in Figure 14. The pressure field at early time matches the loading condition, shown in 
Figure 14 (a). The first several columns of voids collapse to produce strong blast waves, which lead to 
pressures approaching 20 GPa, shown in Figure 14 (a). The temperatures produced in the hotspots due to 
the collapse of the first few columns of voids are in the range of 4000K, shown in Figure 14 (b). Since the 
inter-void  spacing  is  small  (≃ 5	𝜇𝑚),  the  high  intensity  reactive  blast  waves  impact  the  nearby  voids, 

collapsing them at higher pressures, producing even stronger blast waves. As shown in Figure 14 (c), this 
progressive reinforcement of blast waves causes the pressure in the center of the control volume to rise to 
about 26 GPa. Since the voids in the downstream regions collapse under higher pressures, intense hotspots 
form with temperatures in the range of 5000K, as shown in Figure 14 (d).  

The  hotspot  temperatures  reached  for  𝜙 = 20%    are  significantly  higher  than  for 𝜙 = 2%.  The  higher 
temperatures  result  in  rapid  chemical  energy  release,  which  feeds  energy  into  the  blast  waves  thereby 
increasing  the  pressure  even  further.  This  process  occurs  rapidly,  in  a  matter  of  60  ns,  and  leads  to  the 
formation of a self-sustaining detonation wave front seen in Figure 14 (e) and (f). The pressure at the leading 
edge of the detonation front is ~32 GPa and the temperature is ~ 6000 K. Therefore, reactive blast waves 
produced through void collapse have a large impact on the ignition and growth rates at higher void fractions. 
Note that the highest void fractions simulated (for example, 20%) are unlikely to be abundant in typical as-
produced HEs. However, high local volume fractions may be present in isolated regions in stochastic meso-
structures conferring increased sensitivity at such locations. Furthermore, as conjectured by Nichols and 
Tarver  [20]  and  Massoni  et  al.  [22],  they  may  arise  due  to  fragmentation  of  crystals  at  high  pressures, 
leading to significant acceleration of hotspot growth rates. 

3.2.4  Distinguishing the roles of shock focusing and chemical energy release in void-void interactions 

As discussed above, the intensification of the incident shock for high void fractions is caused by the energy 
supplied  by  the  reactive  blast  waves  that  emanate  from  void  collapse  events.  Therefore,  both  the 
reinforcement due to the increased pressures from the blast waves as well as the addition of chemical energy 
at hotspot sites contribute to the enhancement of ignition and growth rates in void fields. To distinguish the 
effect  of  chemical  heat  release  from  the  energy  localization  due  to  blast  waves  alone,  an  inert  case  is 
simulated by switching off chemistry. The inert simulations will indicate whether shock focusing due to 
void collapse alone can lead to the observed intensification of hotspots.  

Figure 15 shows an inert simulation for the reference loading condition. The voids in the upstream column 
have just collapsed in Figure 15 (a) and a series of blast waves is formed. The blast wave pressures are in 
the range of 16 GPa, higher than the 22 GPa observed for the reactive simulation. The temperature contours 
for  the  reactive  and inert  cases  are  also  markedly  different.  Figure  14  (b)  shows multiple  hotspots  with 
temperatures reaching 4000K, whereas the inert simulation results in Figure 15 (b) show smaller hotspots 
with temperature near 1600K. As the shock reaches the end of the void field in Figure 15 (c), most of the 
voids have collapsed but the attenuated shock front has a concave structure, where the maximum pressure 
is only about 7 GPa, in stark contrast with the maximum pressures of 24 GPa seen in Figure 14 (c) for the 
reactive simulation. Figure 15 (d) shows that the low temperature, smaller sized hotspots formed in the inert 
simulations have begun to diffuse.  At the final time shown in Figure 15 (e) and (f), the lead shock wave is 
significantly attenuated and has a strength of around 5 GPa with hotspot temperatures in the 1200K range, 
both of which are significantly lower than the reported pressure and temperature for the same time in the 
reactive simulation. Therefore, it is clear the response in the reactive simulation is an effect of the coupling 
between the chemistry, void collapse induced shock focusing, and the incident shock wave, with chemical 
heat release playing a predominant role. 

Figure 16 (a) and (b) show the x-t plots (colored with pressure levels) for the reactive and inert simulations, 
respectively, for 𝜙 = 20%. Recall the void field starts at 𝑋 = 50𝜇𝑚 and extends to 𝑋 = 250𝜇𝑚, as shown 
in Figure 5; the 1-D pressure data is extracted along the x-direction for 𝑌 = 150	𝜇𝑚. In both the reactive 
and inert simulations, the reference loading pressure is shown, as expected, through 𝑋 = 50𝜇𝑚. Once the 
shock enters the void field, the reactive simulation shows higher pressures than the inert simulation. At the 
end of the void field at 𝑋 = 250𝜇𝑚, the reactive simulation shows a peak pressure of 56 GPa, whereas the 
inert simulation shows the maximum pressure at 3.5 GPa.  

Figure 17 shows the comparison of the slope of the shock locus in the x-t plane for the inert and reactive 
simulations. For comparison, the shock locus for an inert shock traveling through bulk (i.e. void-free) HMX 
is also plotted. Before the shock enters the void field at 𝑋 = 50𝜇𝑚, all three shock loci overlap. Within the 
void field, the bulk HMX shows the highest shock locus slope; thus the unhindered shock travels fastest. 
Upon exiting the void field, the shock travels fastest in the reactive simulation. The speed of the detonation 
wave in the reactive simulation is calculated from the slope of the shock locus as ≃10,100 m/s. This is 
approximately twice the speed of the shock front in bulk HMX, ≃5500m/s. Thus, the strengthening of void-
void interactions in  a  high porosity  void  field is  primarily  due  to  the  addition  of  chemical  energy  from 
hotspots. The localization of energy and shock focusing due to inert void collapse itself does not lead to the 
strengthening of the incident shock. 

4  CONCLUSIONS  

Surrogate models for void shape and void-void interaction effects are constructed using machine learning; 
these models can be used to close the macroscale models in a multi-scale simulation of pressed HMX [2]. 
The surrogate models are trained using the ignition and growth rates calculated from meso-scale simulations

Elongated voids with deviations from cylindrical shape defined by the aspect ratio 𝐴𝑅, and orientation 𝜃 
are used to capture void shape effects. Elongated voids with 4 < 𝐴𝑅 < 22 and orientations between 0° <
𝜃 < 45° show amplified ignition and growth rates compared to the corresponding cylindrical void of the 
same void area, where the ignition rate shows an order of magnitude increase and the growth rate shows a 
modest, but non-negligible, increase. Two key reasons are identified for the enhanced ignition rates for 
hotspots due to elongated void collapse: a) repeated pinching of the void surface along the length of the 
elongated void leads to the collapse of the void under the influence of self-strengthened blast wave, b) the 
formation of strong baroclinic vorticity during the collapse of the elongated void leads to higher temperature 
rise and reaction completion. In the growth phase, the increase in the reaction growth rate for elongated 
voids is related to the larger hot spot burn surface area of the elongated voids. Since the difference in the 
burn front surface area of the hotspots for the elongated and cylindrical voids does not differ by an order of

Spatially and temporally averaged QoIs are obtained to quantify the effects of void-void interaction on a 
representative void embedded in a field of voids. The averaging is performed in a moving control volume 
(𝜙) 
that  encompasses  all  voids.  The  calculated  QoIs  are  used  to  obtain  the    𝑓&’(&)&*(
modifying functions. It is observed that the void volume fraction 𝜙 has a significant effect on the ignition 
and growth rates, where the blast wave interactions between neighboring voids at higher values of 𝜙 lead 
to higher temperature hotspots. At the highest void volume fraction considered, the ignition rate shows an 
order  of  magnitude  increase  and  the  growth  rate  shows  a  modest,  but  non-negligible,  increase.  The 
amplification in the ignition and growth for 𝜙 = 20% leads to the formation of a meso-scale detonation 
front. While high void fractions (for example, 20%) are unlikely to be abundant in typical as-produced HEs, 
high local volume fractions may be present in stochastic meso-structures conferring increased sensitivity at 
such  locations.  Also,  as  conjectured  by  Nichols  and  Tarver  [20]  and  Massoni  et  al.  [22]  high  volume 
fractions  may  arise  because  of  crystal  fragmentation  at  high  pressures,  that  lead  to  accelerated  hotspot 
growth rates.

This work shows that in simulating the response of heterogeneous energetic materials at the macro-scale, a 
meso-informed closure model for energy localization should take into account void-void interactions and 
void shape effects. Both these features can alter the sensitivity of porous HEs significantly. Knowledge of 
the  meso-structure  of  a  HE  can  be  obtained  by  imaging  the  meso-structure  and  deriving  statistical 
information on the meso-morphology. While detailed meso-scale simulations of the response of imaged HE 
samples are now feasible [18], for macro-scale or process-scale sample sizes homogenized closure models 
will continue to be the norm in the foreseeable future. Such models can combine quantification of imaged 
meso-scale morphological metrics (such as void size, void fraction, void shape features etc.) and ignition 
and  growth  rate dependency  on  such  metrics  (via  surrogate  models developed  in  this  work)  to improve 
predictions of HE response.

where 𝜎&¯ is the Cauchy stress tensor and is decomposed into volumetric and deviatoric component, i.e.: 

𝜎&¯ = 𝑆&¯ − 𝑝𝛿&¯ 

The deviatoric stress tensor, 𝑆&¯, is evolved using the following evolution equation.

where, 𝐷&¯ is the strain rate tensor, and G is the shear modulus of material. First the deviatoric stresses are

𝜎¸ is taken to be a constant and set to 260	𝑀𝑃𝑎 [39] for HMX, i.e. hardening, and visco-plastic effects are 
neglected in the meso-scale computational models. A detailed description of the governing equations and 
radial return algorithm is provided in previous work [18, 19, 23-25].

The numerical stiffness in solving the reactive set of equations is circumvented by using a Strang operator

The species evolution Eqn. (35) is advanced in time using a 5th-order Runge-Kutta Fehlberg method [41],

equations. 

7.2  Constitutive and Reaction Models 

The pressure in the meso-scale in Eqn. (31) is obtained from a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [39, 42], 
which can be written in the general Mie-Gruneisen form as:

Void collapse under shock loading can lead to the melting of HMX; therefore thermal softening of HMX 
is modeled using the Kraut-Kennedy relation, 𝑇(cid:226) = 𝑇(cid:226)G ª1 + 𝑎
the work of Menikoff et al. [39]. Once the temperature exceeds the melting point of HMX the deviatoric 
strength terms are set to zero.  Furthermore, the specific heat of HMX is known to change significantly with 
temperature. The variation of specific heat is modeled as a function of temperature as suggested in [39]. 

(cid:230), with model parameters  provided in

The chemical decomposition of HMX is modeled using a 3-step mechanism proposed by Tarver et al. [43]. 
A detailed description of the implementation of the 3-step model in the current numerical framework is 
presented in previous work [34]. Here, a brief overview of the reaction model and its implementation is 
provided. 

Chemical decomposition of HMX takes place in three steps involving four different species:  

Reaction 1: 

𝐻𝑀𝑋	(𝐶(cid:132)𝐻Ł𝑁Ł𝑂Ł) → fragments	(𝐶𝐻Y𝑁𝑁𝑂Y) 

(38) 

Reaction 2: 

fragments	(𝐶𝐻Y𝑁𝑁𝑂Y) → 	intermediate	gases	(𝐶𝐻Y𝑂, 𝑁Y𝑂, 𝐻𝐶𝑁, 𝐻𝑁𝑂Y) 

(39) 

  and  

Reaction 3: 

		2	 × intermediate	gases	(𝐶𝐻Y𝑂, 𝑁Y𝑂, 𝐻𝐶𝑁, 𝐻𝑁𝑂Y)

→ final	gases	(𝑁Y, 𝐻Y𝑂, 𝐶𝑂Y, 𝐶𝑂) 

(40) 

The solid HMX (species 1, mass fraction 𝑌(cid:157)) under high temperature decomposes into fragments (species 
2, 𝑌Y). The fragments are further decomposed to intermediate gases (species 3, 𝑌(cid:141)) which are later converted 
to the final gases (species 4, 𝑌(cid:132)) through exothermic reactions leading to high temperatures in the hotspot.
