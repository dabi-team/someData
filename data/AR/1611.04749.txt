Draft version February 28, 2022

ABSTRACT
We studied the formation of the ﬁrst penumbral sector around a pore in the following polarity of
the Active Region (AR) NOAA 11490. We used a high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution
data set acquired by the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer operating at the NSO/Dunn
Solar Telescope as well as data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory satellite. On the side towards the leading polarity, elongated granules in the
photosphere and an arch ﬁlament system (AFS) in the chromosphere are present, while the magnetic
ﬁeld shows a sea-serpent conﬁguration, indicating a region of magnetic ﬂux emergence. We found that
the formation of a stable penumbra in the following polarity of the AR begins in the area facing the
opposite polarity located below the AFS in the ﬂux emergence region, diﬀerently from what found by
Schlichenmaier and colleaguestbf. Moreover, during the formation of the ﬁrst penumbral sector, the
area characterized by magnetic ﬂux density larger than 900 G and the area of the umbra increase.

1. INTRODUCTION
Magnetic ﬂux emergence and its successive interaction
with the magnetic canopy represent a crucial point in the
ﬁrst stage of the formation of the sunspot penumbrae.

Schlichenmaier et al. (2010b) found that the penumbra
forms in sectors and generally on the side opposite to that
between the two polarities of an active region (AR). Also,
they found that individual ﬁlaments form on the side
towards the opposite polarity, but these are not stable
and disappear on granular lifetimes. In this area, elon-
gated granules are present. They continuously appear
and disappear, indicating a region of ﬂux emergence as
observed in the numerical simulations of Cheung et al.
(2008) and Tortosa-Andreu & Moreno-Insertis (2009).
Schlichenmaier et al. (2010b) concluded that a stable
penumbra cannot form in the region of ﬂux emergence,
because the strong dynamics introduced by ongoing ﬂux
emergence prevent the settlement of the penumbral ﬁeld.
Elongated granules in the photosphere are developed
by emerging horizontal ﬁelds, being aligned with the hor-
izontal component of the emerged ﬁeld (Strous & Zwaan
1999; Cheung et al. 2007, 2008). Recently, Lim et al.
(2013) found that penumbral ﬁlaments were formed in
a region on the side toward the opposite polarity of the
AR. In this region a series of elongated granules was de-
tected in association with an emerging ﬂux region. How-
ever, they detected other cases where the ﬂux emergence
did not form the penumbra, even if accompanied by a se-
ries of elongated granules. They explained this behavior
with the presence or absence of strong overlying canopy
ﬁelds.

In this context, we recall that an important signa-
ture of magnetic ﬂux emergence in the chromosphere
is a bundle of dark arches crossing the polarity inver-

sion line, called arch ﬁlament system (AFS; e.g., Bruzek
1980; Spadaro et al. 2004; Zuccarello et al. 2005). Such
a structure is usually observed in the hours following the
appearance of Hα brightenings.

Here, we present one of the rare observations of the for-
mation of the penumbra, starting from the side towards
the opposite polarity, below an AFS, in the AR NOAA
11490. In the next Section we describe the whole data
set and its analysis. In Section 3 we present the results.
Finally, in Section 4 we summarize our conclusions.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS
We study the following spot of the AR NOAA 11490
using high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution data
acquired by the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrom-
eter (IBIS; Cavallini 2006) operating at the NSO/Dunn
Solar Telescope (DST). The observations were carried
out on 2012 May 28 from 13:39 UT to 14:38 UT.

The whole data set acquired on 2012 May 28, whose
relevant characteristics were already described in detail
in Romano et al. (2013), consists of 45 scans through
the Fe I 617.30 nm, Fe I 630.25 nm, and Ca II 854.2
nm lines, with 67 s cadence. Among these, 15 scans
are relevant to the following part of the AR and were
acquired from 14:19 UT to 14:38 UT, as shown in the
Figure 1 of Romano et al. (2013). The observed ﬁelds
of view (FOVs) are shown in Figure 1a. The lines were
sampled with a spectral proﬁle having a full with half
maximum of 2 pm and an average wavelength step of
2 pm. The Fe I 617.3 nm and 630.25 nm lines were
sampled in spectro-polarimetric mode with 30 and 24
spectral points, respectively. The signal-to-noise ratio of
these measurements is about 3 × 10−3 in units of contin-
uum intensity per Stokes parameter. The Ca II 854.2 nm
line was sampled in spectroscopic mode with 25 spectral
points. The FOV of each camera was 500 × 1000 pixels,
with a pixel scale of 0.′′09.

For each spectral frame, a simultaneous broad-band
(at 633.32 ± 5 nm) frame was acquired, imaging the same
FOV observed in spectro-polarimetric mode and with the
same exposure time. To reduce the seeing degradation,

the images were restored using the Multi-Frame Blind
Deconvolution (MFBD; L¨ofdahl 2002) technique (see de-
tails in Romano et al. 2013).

To determine the strength and the inclination angle
of the magnetic ﬁeld we performed a single-component
inversion of the Stokes proﬁles for all the available
I 617.3 nm line using the SIR
scans of
code (Ruiz Cobo & del Toro Iniesta 1992). The pro-

To study the evolution in the forming penumbra, we
also analyzed both Space-weather HMI Active Region
Patches (SHARPs, Bobra et al. 2014) continuum ﬁlter-
grams and magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory (SDO, Scherrer et al. 2012) satellite. These data
are taken in the Fe I 617.3 nm line with a resolution of
1′′. They cover seven hours of observations, starting from
2012 May 28 at 13:58:25 UT until 20:58:25 UT, with a
cadence of 12 minutes.

IBIS and SDO/HMI observations were co-aligned using
as a reference the ﬁrst spectral image in the continuum
of the Fe I 617.3 nm line taken by IBIS at 14:20 UT
on 2012 May 28 and the continuum ﬁltergram closest in
time taken by SDO/HMI. We used the IDL SolarSoft
mapping routines to take into account the diﬀerent pixel
sizes.

Maps of the mean circular polarization averaged over
the line, Vs, and of the mean linear polarization signal,
Ls, were calculated using

3. RESULTS
3.1. Formation of the ﬁrst penumbral sector and its

evolution

AR NOAA 11490 consists of two preceding main
sunspots with positive polarity and a more diﬀuse nega-
tive polarity in the following part of the AR (see Figure
1b). The initial stage of the penumbra formation in the
leading spot, located in the FOV A indicated with the
dashed box in Figure 1a, was already described in a pre-
vious paper (Murabito et al. 2016). The penumbra forms
in about 10 hours and the ﬁrst sector develops on the side
located away from the opposite polarity.

Here, we study the penumbra formation in the follow-
ing part of the AR, located in the FOV B (solid box, Fig-
ure 1a). This phenomenon occurred in about 15 hours.
In particular, the pore that is visible at [-195′′,-185′′]×[-
205′′,-200′′] evolved into a mature sunspot: a penumbra
almost encircled the spot on 29 May 2012 at 21:00 UT
(see Figure 1d).

Figure 2 shows the formation of the ﬁrst penumbral
sector of the following negative polarity from 15:00 UT to
20:00 UT on 28 May 2012. We note that from 15:00 UT
to 18:00 UT the area of the umbra enlarges as a result
of the merging of a patch of the same polarity as the
following pore (see the green arrow in Figure 2g). In fact,
comparing the images in the continuum of Figure 2a-f we
ﬁnd that the area of the umbra increases of about 42.5
arcsec2 in 5 hours (from about 35 arcsec2 at 15:00 UT
to 77 arcsec2 at 20:00 UT). The total area of the umbra
is determined by contours with a threshold of Ic = 0.5
(see Figure 2a-f). Similarly, the area characterized by

The values are saturated at ±500 G. Red contours in the magnetograms indicate the area characterized by negative magnetic ﬂux density

negative magnetic ﬂux grows by about 60 arcsec2, as
derived by contours at −900 G (see the magnetograms
in Figure 2g-i).

these areas is also reported in Figure 3f. These graphs
illustrate that the ﬁrst penumbral sector grows smoothly
without interruption as the negative magnetic ﬂux in-
creases. This trend remains constant in the following
hours after 21:00 UT. By contrast, the penumbral areas
characterized by positive magnetic ﬁeld are transient.

At 18:00 UT we can see that the ﬁrst penumbral ﬁl-
aments are formed. In the subsequent three hours they
increase radially in size, outwards from the spot and to-
ward the opposite polarity. Figure 3 clariﬁes that these
penumbral ﬁlaments are stable. We analyze more in de-
tail the region around the ﬁrst penumbral sector, indi-
cated with the box in Figure 2a, from 14:00 UT to 21:00
UT. To get rid of possible projection errors, we use the
vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld deduced from
SHARP data. In Figure 3a, at 15:00 UT we ﬁnd the pres-
ence of some dark areas with 0.5 < Ic < 0.9. The larger
area at [-175′′,-165′′]×[-193′′,-188′′] is characterized by
negative polarity, the same as the adjacent pore. There
is also a dark patch with positive ﬁeld facing the pore at
[-164′′,-159′′]×[-201′′,-196′′] (see Figure 3b). However, at
20:00 UT the latter disappears, while the dark area with
negative ﬁeld adjacent to the pore increases, as can be
seen from Figure 3c-d. In Figure 3e we plot the positive
(red symbols) and negative (blue symbols) magnetic ﬂux
evolution in the areas with 0.5 < Ic < 0.9, corresponding
to the regions of penumbra formation comprised in the
box. The simultaneous evolution of the spatial extent of

Figure 4 shows the whole region observed with IBIS,
that is both FOV A and FOV B, observed from 13:39 UT
to 14:12 UT and from 14:19 to 14:38 UT, respectively.
In particular, in this Figure (top panels) we display the
maps acquired in the continuum of the Fe I 617.3 nm
and in the center of the Ca II 854.2 nm line on May
28. To obtain these images, where both the following
and the leading polarity observed by IBIS are visible,
we used a cross-correlation technique aligning a common
area between the two FOVs.

The map of the continuum (top left panel, Figure 4) re-
veals that the following spot is characterized by an umbra
and a region between the two polarities comprised in [-
170′′,-150′′]×[-225′′,-205′′], where elongated granules are
visible. Figure 4 (top right panel) shows the same region
in the Ca II line center. We note the presence of an AFS.
This suggests that the area characterized by elongated

granules in photosphere corresponds to a region of mag-
netic ﬂux emergence. This region is also characterized
by a magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration having a ﬁlamentary
shape (Figure 4, bottom left panel) with a sea-serpent
conﬁguration, i.e., formed by a bundle of bipolar patches
(e.g. Sainz Dalda & Bellot Rubio 2008). In the magnetic
ﬁeld map (Figure 3, bottom left panel) we note that these
ﬁlamentary structures are not aligned with the structure
of the AFS visible in the Ca II line center. The ﬁlamen-
tary and mixed pattern of the magnetic ﬁeld can be also
distinguished in the inclination angle map (see Figure 4,
bottom right panel), but on a larger scale. In fact, we
ﬁnd ﬁlaments characterized in their inner part by mag-
netic ﬁeld inclination both less and larger than 90◦.

This ﬁlamentary structure can be also recognized in
the linear and circular polarization maps relevant to the
FOV B, which are displayed in Figure 5. These maps are
deduced by IBIS spectropolarimetric data at 14:21 UT,
i.e., the scan with the best seeing. We can use these maps
as proxies of vertical and horizontal ﬁelds, respectively,
given the position close to the disc center of the AR.

In the Ls map (Figure 5, left panel), we note around
the proto-spot a wide region at [-210′′,-205′′]×[-162′′,-
152′′] with diﬀerent values of linear polarization. In par-
ticular, in the region where later the ﬁrst penumbral sec-
tor starts to form, the values are larger than 4%, while
in the northern part of the pore the linear polarization
is smaller than about 1%. The Vs map (Figure 5, right
panel) shows a diﬀuse negative polarity corresponding
with the area of the proto-spot and its surroundings. The
area between the two magnetic polarities is characterized
by a pattern of alternate positive and negative bipoles,
with a sea-serpent conﬁguration.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Our ﬁndings concerning the penumbra formation in the
following polarity of the AR NOAA 11490 are that: (i)
penumbral ﬁlaments form in the side facing the opposite

polarity; (ii) elongated granules in the photosphere, an
AFS in the chromosphere, and a magnetic ﬁeld with sea-
serpent conﬁguration are present in the region between
the two polarities.

The region between the two polarities is character-
ized by elongated granules, as described in previous ob-
servations (see Schlichenmaier et al. 2010a). However,
Schlichenmaier et al. (2010a) concluded that this region,
being characterized by ﬂux emergence, cannot form sta-
ble penumbrae. Nevertheless, our observations highlight
that the ﬁrst stable penumbral sector around the pore
forms exactly in the region where a large amount of mag-
netic ﬂux is emerging, as demonstrated by the presence
of the AFS in the chromosphere.

The ﬁlamentary pattern of the magnetic ﬁeld, seen also
in the inclination angle of the magnetic ﬁeld, in the po-
larization map, and in the continuum, is similar to the
sea-serpent conﬁguration. Bipolar patches are observed
close to the proto-spot. These features are interpreted
as being produced by ﬁeld lines arising (positive polar-
ity) and going down (negative polarity) in the photo-
sphere. Spectropolarimetric measurements have revealed
the existence of such ﬁeld lines that originate in the mid
penumbra and propagate toward the outer penumbral
boundary (see, e.g. Sainz Dalda & Bellot Rubio 2008;
Kitiashvili et al. 2010). Weiss et al. (2004) suggested
that the turbulent pumping by granular convection
drags the ﬂux tubes downward in the moat region to
form the sea-serpent conﬁguration. This magnetic con-
ﬁguration, due to magnetoconvection in strongly in-
clined magnetic ﬁelds (Kitiashvili et al. 2010),
is fre-
quently adopted also to interpret observed properties
of bipolar magnetic features in relation with penum-
(Sainz Dalda & Mart´ınez Pillet 2005;
bral
Sainz Dalda & Bellot Rubio 2008).
In this sense, this
conﬁguration may be considered as a further precursor
of the penumbra formation, in cases similar to our ob-
servations.

Lim et al. (2013) observed the formation of penum-
bral ﬁlaments associated with ﬂux emergence under pre-
existing chromospheric canopy ﬁelds. In particular, they
linked the presence/absence of a pre-existing horizontal
ﬁeld in the chromosphere not only to the penumbra for-
mation, but also to another issue related to the penum-
bra, such as the formation of an orphan penumbra.

Recently, MacTaggart et al. (2016) presented simula-
tions of AR ﬂux emergence where they demonstrated
that the overlying magnetic canopies are a consequence
of how the magnetic ﬁeld emerges into the photosphere.

These canopies mainly form in the region away from
the opposite polarities, where the penumbra ﬁrst forms.
However, also in the region between the two main
sunspots of the AR there is a low probability, but not
null, of ﬁnding near-horizontal ﬁelds. MacTaggart et al.
(2016) suggest that such canopies are the source of highly
inclined horizontal ﬁelds required to produce penumbrae.
This situation may explain the presence of horizontal
ﬁelds at the photospheric level before the penumbra for-
mation found in our observations (Figure 4, left panel).
From our study we think that formation of the ﬁrst

6

Murabito et al.

penumbral sector between the two polarities may be as-
cribed not only to the presence of strong overlying canopy
ﬁlds, as suggested by Lim et al. (2013), but also to the
rising velocity of the rising velocity of the magnetic ﬂux
bundle, which might diﬀer from the other cases presented
in the literature. Therefore, it would be important to
collect new data sets relevant to penumbra formation,
hopefully occurring between the two main polarities of
an AR, to provide observational constraints for the ris-
ing velocities. This will also allow to have a larger sample
of this kind of evolution, in order to unveil the underlying
physical mechanism.
