Abstract—This letter revisits the channel estimation problem
for MIMO systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters
(ADCs) through a novel algorithm–Amplitude Retrieval (AR).
Unlike the state-of-the-art methods such as those based on one-bit
compressive sensing, AR takes a different approach. It accounts
for the lost amplitudes of the one-bit quantized measurements,
and performs channel estimation and amplitude completion
jointly. This way, the direction information of the propagation
paths can be estimated via accurate direction ﬁnding algorithms
in array processing, e.g., maximum likelihood. The upsot is that
AR is able to handle off-grid angles and provide more accurate
channel estimates. Simulation results are included to showcase
the advantages of AR.

I. INTRODUCTION

An effective way to mitigate hardware complexity, cost, and
power consumption in commercial large-scale multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems is to use one-bit analog-
to-digital converters (ADCs) at both transmitter and receiver.
However, with such conﬁguration, each received data sample
gives rise to a single bit, i.e., only the sign of that sample is
recorded. This challenges many standard channel estimation
techniques such as least squares and minimum mean-square
error, which were originally designed for ﬁnely quantized data.
Therefore, developing novel channel estimation algorithms
for MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs is of practical and
methodological interest.

In the past, numerous successes have been reported on
channel estimation from sign measurements, such as [1]–[4].
A common assumption behind these algorithms is that the
multipath channel consists of a few distinct paths. Most of
these algorithms are compressive sensing (CS) based methods
that exploit the sparsity of the channel in the angular domain
for channel estimation. Following this theme, the authors of [1]
proposed an expectation-maximum (EM) channel estimator.
In [2], a near maximum likelihood method was devised and
shown to attain better performance than the EM algorithm.
These CS based methods perform well under favorable con-
ditions – perfect sparsity, known number of paths, and high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) – e.g., see [1]. However, such
clean and well-determined scenarios rarely arise in practice.
One major concern arises from the over-complete dictionaries.

Under the double-directional channel model, the actual dictio-
nary is a Kronecker product of two or more “fat” dictionary
matrices, which results in a very hard linear inverse problem.
Moreover, to handle random direction-of-arrival (DOA) and
direction-of-departure (DOD), ﬁne grids should be used to
generate each dictionaries. Therefore, the ﬁnal dictionary has
strong correlation between the adjacent columns, which further
aggrevates the parameter estimation problem.

The work in [5], [6] studied a similar channel estimation
problem but from a different perspective, where downlink
channel estimation is performed at the base station using bits
fed back from mobile users, conveying just the sign of their
received signal. These methods can be directly applied to
solve the channel estimation problem for MIMO systems with
one-bit ADCs. In [5], the authors exploited the sparsity in
the channel matrix and developed an efﬁcient algorithm with
closed-form expression for channel estimation. The algorithm
works with a nonuniform dictionary which requires some prior
knowledge of the DOA/DOD information of the paths that may
not be feasible in practice, especially in fast moving scenarios
where DOA/DOD could change rapidly. The method in [6]
is based on the so-called binary iterative hard thresholding
(BIHT) technique [7]. Both [5] and [6] suffer from the same
drawbacks as the aforementioned one-bit CS based channel
estimators.

Can we avoid the inherent

limitations of overcomplete,
highly correlated dictionaries and one-bit CS, enabling high-
resolution estimates of the path angles, even if off-grid? Our
goal in this letter is to obtain an afﬁrmative answer to this
question. We propose a novel algorithm named amplitude
retrieval (AR) for downlink channel estimation from only
sign measurements. Unlike pre-existing methods, AR takes
the lost amplitudes of the sign measurements into account
and alternately optimizes between the amplitudes and channel
parameters. The advantages in algorithm design of doing this
are two-fold: 1) It avoids the construction of large-dimensional
dictionary, and it does not suffer performance degradation
caused by the coherency in the dictionary; and 2) it enables to
handle off-grid angles via more sophisticated algorithms such
as maximum likelihood (ML) for multidimensional harmonic
retrieval. In this way, we can simultaneously improve the
estimation accuracy of channel parameters, i.e., DOA, DOD
and path gain. Simulation results are included to show the
effectiveness of AR.

II. SIGNAL MODEL
Consider the downlink of a narrowband (or a single tone
in a wideband OFDM) FDD MIMO system equipped with

 
 
 
 
 
 
one-bit ADCs on the receiver end, where the recorded signal
is

a constraint is nonconvex w.r.t. H, which makes optimization
design more challenging.

2

Y = sign (Re(HS + N)) + jsign (Im(HS + N))

(1)

where sign(·), Re(·) and Im(·) take the sign, real and imag-
inary parts of their arguments, respectively, S ∈ CMt×N
denotes the training signal, N ∈ CMr×N is white Gaussian
noise, and H ∈ CMr×Mt
is the channel matrix. Here, N ,
Mr and Mt denote the number of training samples, receive
antennas and transmit antennas, respectively.

We assume a specular multipath channel comprising a
few dominant paths, each characterized by DOA, DOD and
channel gain [4][7]. This channel model is appropriate under
certain conditions. For example, when the BS antenna array is
mounted on top of a tall building or cellular tower, such that
the number of local scatterers is limited; or when the carrier
frequency is lifted to the millimeter wave range, where due to
the severe path loss only a few specular reﬂections arrive at
the other end of the link [8], [9]. Based on this assumption,
the channel matrix can be expressed as

H = Ar(θ)diag(β)AH

t (φ)

(2)

where (·)H is the conjugate transpose, diag(·) denotes a
diagonal matrix, Ar(θ) = [ar(θ1) · · · ar(θK)], At(φ) =
[at(φ1) · · · at(φK)] and β = [β1 · · · βK]T . Here, (·)T is the
transpose, {θk}, {φk} and {βk} are DOA, DOD and path-loss,
respectively, ar(θk) = (cid:2) ej2πf0τ1(θk) · · · ej2πf0τMr (θk) (cid:3)T
and
at(φ) = (cid:2) ej2πf0τ1(φ) · · · ej2πf0τMt (φ) (cid:3)T
are the kth steering
vector at the receiver and transmitter, respectively, in which
τm(θk) is the time needed by the signal that bounces off the
kth scatterer to reach the mth receive antenna, and τm(φk) is
the time that the signal emitted from the mth transmit antenna
takes to arrive at the kth scatterer.

A. Challenges

In FDD systems, to control the downlink training overhead,
the training signal S could be a tall matrix, meaning that
S cannot be canceled out using matched ﬁltering technique.
This poses an extremely hard problem for channel parameter
estimation, especially for DOD estimation. To handle this
issue, one seeks to exploit the sparsity in the angle domain, i.e.,
constructing two dictionaries for DOA and DOD, respectively,
and then transforming the channel estimation problem to an
one-bit compressive sensing problem. Several algorithms have
been proposed based on this idea [1]–[6]. However, one major
concern in these approaches is that they might be impotent
when dealing with off-grid angles due to the limited resolution
of their angular dictionary. To ensure high resolution, ﬁne grids
can be used to construct the dictionary, but this inevitably
causes coherency in adjacent columns of the dictionary and
ultimately leads to unsatisfactory performance. Furthermore,
due to the lack of amplitude information about HS, there is
no uniqueness guarantee of the channel estimate, even at high
SNR, and any scaled version of H which does not change the
signs is admissible as well. A common way to ﬁx this issue
is to enforce a norm constraint, i.e., (cid:107)H(cid:107)2
F = R, where R is
an expected value of the channel norm. Unfortunately, such

III. AMPLITUDE RETRIEVAL

In this section, we derive an AR algorithm to alleviate
the aforementioned challenges. Before proceeding with the
detailed derivations, let us ﬁrst bring forth our motivation. We
note that the data matrix Y only preserves the signs of the
real and imaginary parts of the baseband radio signals, while
the corresponding amplitudes are lost. This can be viewed the
‘dual’ of the classical phase retrieval problem [10], in which
the phase of the received data is missing and the signal of
interest can be efﬁciently estimated by completing the phase
[11], [12]. Assuming that the amplitude of Y, denoted by Γ,
is available, then we have, in the noiseless case

Y (cid:125) Γ = HS

(3)

where (cid:125) is deﬁned as a(cid:125)b = Re(a)(cid:126)Re(b)+jIm(a)(cid:126)Im(b)
with (cid:126) being the element-wise product. Estimating H from
Y (cid:125) Γ is a relatively easy task compared to the channel
estimation from Y. Based on this motivation, we propose
a novel channel estimation algorithm that we call Amplitude
Retrieval (AR), which aims to estimate the lost amplitude and
channel parameters jointly.

AR deals with the following optimization problem

(4)

where (cid:107) · (cid:107)F is the Frobenius norm, the ﬁrst two constraints
ensure non-negativity of the amplitude, and the third constraint
is to prevent the scaling ambiguity. It should be highlighted
that Problem (4) does not rely on any angular dictionary and
it enables to handle off-grid angles using an ML method. This
is a major advantage over many existing compressive sensing
based approaches.

We adopt alternating optimization to solve (4), i.e., we
optimize over {Γ, {θ, β, φ}} and H by ﬁxing one for another.
Assume that after r iterations, we have a channel estimate H(r)
available. Then at the next iteration, the subproblem w.r.t. Γ
is given by

problem. Existing algorithms such as [13] and ML [14] are
applicable to handle (7). However, when non-uniform arrays
are used, HR methods are no longer applicable. Instead, we
can seek an ML method to optimize (7). Towards this goal,
let us rewrite the objective function in (7) as

plex conjugate, Khatri-Rao product and vectorization operator,
respectively.

It follows from [15] that substituting the least squares
estimate of β, i.e., ˆβ = A†h(r) into (7), the ML cost for

employ a few gradient iterations to update η, i.e.,

where µ((cid:96)) is the step-size and

The above is a quadratically constrained quadratic program-
ming (QCQP) problem with one constraint. It is well known
that for such a QCQP problem, even though the constraint is
non-convex, it can always be solved to optimality, by strong
duality [16], [17]. In the following derivations, the superscript
(r + 1) will be temporally removed for notational simplicity.
First, let us write down the Lagrangian of (10) as [17]
F + λ(cid:107)H − ˜H(cid:107)2

L = (cid:107)Y (cid:125) Γ − HS(cid:107)2

F + ρ((cid:107)H(cid:107)2

F − R) (12)

where ρ is the dual variable. The necessary condition for
optimality is that ∇L = 0, i.e.,

∇L = H(cid:0)SSH + ˜ρI(cid:1) − Λ = 0

which results in

H = Λ (cid:0)SSH + ˜ρI(cid:1)−1

(13)

(14)

where (·)−1 is matrix inverse, ˜ρ = ρ + λ, Λ = (Y (cid:126) Γ)SH +
λ ˜H. Now the problem is to ﬁnd ˜ρ such that (14) is feasible.

Substituting (14) into the norm constraint in (10) yields

(cid:16)

Λ (cid:0)SSH + ˜ρI(cid:1)−2

ΛH (cid:17)

= R

(15)

which equals to

Mt(cid:88)

(cid:107)c1(cid:107)2
2
(˜ρ + ςi)2 = R
where trace(·) is the trace operator, ci is the ith column of
ΛUH with U being the eigenvector matrix of SSH , and ςi is
the corresponding eigenvalue. Since {ci, ςi} are all known, ρ
can be numerically found by solving (16).

In the following, we brieﬂy show that there exists a real ˜ρ

such that (15) holds true. Deﬁne f (˜ρ) = (cid:80)Mt

i=1
It follows from [16] that for the dual of QCQP with one con-
straint, we have SSH + ˜ρI (cid:31) 0. Therefore, f (cid:48)(˜ρ) < 0, meaning
that f (˜ρ) is monotonically decreasing and such feasible ˜ρ is
unique. Moreover, ˜ρ+ςi > 0, ∀i implies that ςmin < ˜ρ < +∞,
therefore (15) always has a root in (ςmin, +∞), where ςmin
is the smallest eigenvalue of SSH . We may employ either
bisection or Newton’s method to estimate ˜ρ. Once ˜ρ is found,
plugging it back to (14), we obtain the optimal solution for
(10).

Special Case I: When S semi-unitary, i.e., SH S = I, using

the matrix inversion lemma, we can rewrite (15) as
R˜ρ4 + 2R˜ρ3 + (R − t1)˜ρ2 + 2(t2 − t1)˜ρ + t2 − t1 = 0 (18)
where t1 = trace(ΛΛH ) and t2 = trace(ΛSSH ΛH ). In this
case, ςmin = 0 and ˜ρ > 0, which implies that (18) has a unique
positive root which is indeed the right ˜ρ. Furthermore, we can
also avoid the inverse in (14) to reduce the complexity in the
update of H, i.e., H = Λ (cid:0)I/˜ρ − SSH /(˜ρ(1 + ˜ρ))(cid:1).

Special Case II: When S unitary, i.e., SH S = SSH =
I. Eq. (15) becomes (1 + ˜ρ)2 = trace(ΛΛH )/R. Then the
optimal solution is

(cid:113)

trace(ΛΛH )/R − 1.

Remark 1: We emphasize that although our method is
presented in a downlink setting, its usage is not limited to
that. Actually, AR can be easily extended to solve the uplink
channel estimation problem under the TDD protocol without
changing anything, as we will see in Section IV.

IV. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON

In this section, we present numerical results to evaluate the
performance of AR by comparing it with the state-of-the-art
algorithms including a soft-thresholding (ST) based technique
[5], joint BIHT (J-BIHT) [6] and the EM algorithm [1]. We
report their mean square error (MSE) performance which is
(cid:13)
2
deﬁned as MSE = 1/100 (cid:80)200
F .
(cid:13)
i=1
Note that for ST, EM and J-BIHT, their dictionary is with 7
bits, i.e., we split [0, π] using 128 grids points. Therefore,
the minimum resolution ability using this dictionary is π/128.
In the following simulations, by taking this resolution into
account, we consider relatively widely-spaced DOAs/DODs,
i.e., any two adjacent DOAs or DODs are separated at least
π/16.

(cid:13) ˆHi/(cid:107) ˆHi(cid:107)F −Hi/(cid:107)Hi(cid:107)F

A. Downlink Channel Estimation in FDD

We consider a downlink case, where the transmit and receive
antenna arrays are ULAs with number of elements being
Mr = 4 and Mt = 64, respectively. The number of training
samples is N = 32. We ﬁx the number of paths as K = 5
and generate angles from the range [0, π]. Fig. 1 shows the
NMSE performance as a function of SNR. We can see that
AR achieves substantially better performance than the other
three methods. EM and J-BITH failed to perform well. The
main reason is that the two algorithms intrinsically assumed
on-grid DOAs/DODs and an overdetermined setting, i.e., the
number of paths is smaller than Mr. However, in this example,
the number of paths is greater than Mr, which violates the
overdetermined assumption. Similar results can also be found
in Fig. 2, where SNR = 10 dB and the way of generating
channel parameters is the same as in Fig. 1. As N increases,
the performance of the competitors increases accordingly. AR
still performs the best and ST is the second best.

B. Uplink Channel Estimation in TDD

As we have mentioned in Section III, AR can be used for
uplink channel estimation in TDD systems. To verify this,
we deﬁne a simple uplink scenario, where the BS has a
ULA with 64 antennas receiving signals from K = 16 users.

Fig. 3. NMSE versus SNR (uplink case)

Here, we assume that each user is equipped with a single
antenna and communicates with the BS through one dominant
propagation path. Moreover, orthogonal training signals are
used, i.e., N = K and SSH = I. The NMSE performance
versus SNR is plotted in Fig. 3. AR is the best in terms of
NMSE performance. However, unlike the downlink case, the
EM and J-BIHT algorithms showed much better performance.
This is because the number of users is much smaller than the
number of the antennas at the BS, which is an overdetermined
setting and meets the assumption in EM and J-BIHT.

V. CONCLUSION

We have devised an AR algorithm for MIMO channel
estimation from one-bit quantized measurements. AR is able
to avoid the shortcomings of many CS based algorithms. It
alternately optimizes between the amplitudes of the measure-
ments and channel parameters. With completed amplitudes,
the DOAs, DODs and path gains can be estimated using
harmonic retrieval or ML algorithms. Thus, AR can deal
with any random propagation path, not necessarily on a grid.
Simulations have veriﬁed the success of AR relative to the
state-of-art in the literature.
