ABSTRACT

We studied the multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of the high mass
X-ray binary MAXI J1348–630 during two successive outbursts of April and June
2019 using ALMA, Swift, Chandra, NuSTAR and NICER. The position of the
source was measured by Chandra (RA=13h48m12.878s, Dec=–63◦16′28.85′′) with
enhanced accuracy. The soft X-ray spectrum (1–6 keV) was intensively studied
using Chandra/HETG from which multiple absorption-features corresponding to
Fe XXII, Fe XXIII, Si XII, Cl XVI, S XV, Ar XVIII lines and the emission
features corresponding to Fe XXI, Fe XXIII, Ar XVI lines were detected. We
studied the ﬁrst broadband spectrum for this black hole that included ﬂuxes in
radio, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray energy bands using data from ALMA (band
3, 4, 6 and 7; 89.56–351.44 GHz) and swift (UVOT and XRT). The broadband
study suggested that the source was accompanied by strong blackbody radiation
from the disk associated with weak synchrotron emission from the compact jets.
The X-ray spectrum was also studied using NuSTAR in the range of 3–78 keV.
We studied the evolution of spectral parameters using NuSTAR observations
(from MJD 58655 to MJD 58672) when the source remained in the canonical
hard state during the outburst of June 2019. We detected two type-C QPOs
during the outburst of June 2019 with decreasing centroid frequencies from 0.82
Hz to 0.67 Hz and decreasing RMS amplitude from 7.6 per cent to 2.1 per cent.
The hardness ratio showed signiﬁcant variation during the outburst of April 2019
but remained almost constant during the outburst of June 2019. The spectral
evolution in the hardness intensity diagram was studied during the outbursts.

Introduction

Black hole transients are known to accrete matters from their companion rotational
stars in the form of an accretion disk which often results in outbursts. Matters are sup-

plied to the black hole through disk winds which may generate jets. The transition between
diﬀerent states with a variation of timing and spectral properties are generally observed
during the outburst (Homan & Belloni 2005). Black hole transients spend a large dura-
tion of time (several months to years) in quiescence, but during the time of an outburst,
strong emission is observed from X-ray to radio wavelengths (Chakrabarti, Pal & Nandi
2006; Pal et al. 2006; Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2009; Cadolle et al. 2011) and the the source lumi-
nosity increases by several orders of magnitude in all wavelengths of electromagnetic spec-
trum (Remillard & McClintock 2006).

An outburst of a Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXRB) is characterized by its evolution
through diﬀerent spectral states (Remillard & McClintock 2006; Belloni 2009). BHXRBs
have been observed to evolve as Hard State (HS) → Hard-intermediate State (HIMS) →
Soft-intermediate State (SIMS) → Soft State (SS), on the rising phase of an outburst
(Homan & Belloni 2005). Energy spectra and X-ray variabilities show diﬀerent character-
istics on diﬀerent spectral states as they evolve through the outburst. The source return
to the quiescence followingthe the reverse order of spectral states (Homan & Belloni 2005;
van der Klis 2006; Belloni, Motta & Mu˜noz-Darias 2011; Motta et al. 2011). Most of the
source evolve through the above-said spectral state sequence and create a “q” shaped track
in the HID (Homan & Belloni 2005; Remillard & McClintock 2006; Dunn et al. 2010) during
an outburst but all source does not always follow this order (Sreehari et al. 2019).

During SS, spectra are steep with typical spectral index (Γ)& 2.5 (Remillard & McClintock

2006). Accretion disks are relatively hotter with a typical disk temperature of kT ≈ 1 keV
(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Dunn et al. 2010) and thermal X-rays are emitted from the inner-
most part of the accretion disk. The spectra become hard with Γ ≈ 1.6 in HS and accretion
disks become relatively cooler (Makishima et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2008; Takahashi et al.
2008). Multi-wavelength observations help to understand emission mechanisms from diﬀer-
ent regions of the source, accretion phenomenon or transition through diﬀerent states during
the outburst of a BHXRB.

BHXRBs are known to emit strong synchrotron emission from compact jets (Fender
2006; Gallo 2010). A correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities are found to be
present (Gallo, Fender & Pooley 2003; Carotenuto et al. 2021) which indicates a coupling
nature between the jets and the accretion disk (Yadav 2001; Corbel et al. 2003).

The BHXRB transient MAXI J1348–630 was discovered during a giant outburst in
January 2019 (Yatabe et al. 2019). Two subsequent outbursts continued in April 2019 and
June 2019 (Negoro et al. 2019). During the ﬁrst outburst in January 2019, the averaged ﬂux
reached a maximum of ∼4 Crab as measured by MAXI/GSC in 2–20 keV (Tominaga et al.
2020). The second outburst of a relatively smaller magnitude started in the last week of April

– 3 –

2019 before the outburst of January completed its decaying phase (Negoro et al. 2019).

Previous observations suggest that the source is a black hole candidate (Sanna et al.
2019; Tominaga et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). The mass of the black hole was estimated to
be ∼7M⊙ (Tominaga et al. 2020) and the source distance is approximately 4 kpc. From the
January 2019 outburst, two low-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) at frequency
0.57 Hz and 0.66 Hz (Jana et al. 2020) and several type-B QPOs between 4.514 Hz and 4.096
Hz were detected (Belloni et al. 2020).

In this paper, we studied the evolution of diﬀerent timing and spectral properties of
the black hole MAXI J1348–630 during the outburst of April and June 2019. Observation
and data analysis methods of diﬀerent instruments were discussed in section 2, results were
summarised in section 3. The discussion and the conclusion were made in section 4 and 5
respectively.

2. Observations and data analysis

2.1. ALMA

We have used the high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)1

interferometric 12 m array data for exploring the radio properties of the black hole MAXI
J1348–630. The observation was done on 2 May 2019 starting from 03h07m29.7s UTC. The
observational summary is given in Table 1. During the observation, the device was set up
in bands 3, 4, 6, and 7 with four spectral windows. The bandwidth of all science spectral
windows is 187.50 MHz which is divided into 1920 channels. The black hole was observed in
ALMA band 3 to band 7 with XX, YY signal substances via integration time 1149.120 sec.
During the observation, a total of 43 antennas was working with a baseline ranging from 42
to 1574 m. The antenna temperature did not exceed above 100 K because the environmental
condition was very good. During the observation, the source J1427–4206 was observed as a
bandpass, and ﬂux calibrator and J1337–6503 was observed as a phase calibrator. We have
used Perley-Butler 2017 (Perley & Butler 2017) for ﬂux scale calibration.

We used the Common Astronomy Software Application (CASA v 5.4.1)2 for initial data
reduction and continuum imaging of black hole MAXI J1348–630 with standard calibration
scripts. After calibration, we used the task MSTRANSFORM to split the corrected target data

– 4 –

set and the continuum image of the source was made by using task TCLEAN with the stokes
I parameter. The image was deconvolved several times with 12000 iterations. We also used
the task UVCONTSUB for background noise subtraction and several self-calibration processes.
The self-calibration process was done by the tasks GAINCAL and APPLYCAL.

2.2. Chandra

The Chandra observatory uses mirrors with multiple instruments to focus and collect
X-rays from highly energetic celestial objects. The focal plane consists of two science in-
struments – Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) and High-Resolution Camera
(HRC) which captures the high-resolution images created by mirrors and collects informa-
tion about incoming X-rays. There are two other science instruments onboard Chandra for
high-resolution spectroscopy – High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) (Canizares et al.
2005) and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) (Brinkman et al. 2000) spectrometers.
Science instruments onboard Chandra have the capabilities to collect and analyze X-ray im-
ages and properties of celestial bodies with exceptional accuracy having an angular resolution
of 0.5′′ over the energy range of 0.2–10 keV.

The Chandra observation of the black hole binary MAXI J1348–630 was made using
ACIS array during the outburst with HETG (Obs Id – 21239). The observation log is
summarised in Table 1. We have analysed these data using CIAO v 4.12 with the latest
CALDB v 4.9.4. We followed the standard Chandra data analysis threads for data reduction
and analysis. The task tgdetect2 was used to ﬁnd the location of the source from the zero-
order image and the location of High Energy Grating (HEG) and Medium Energy Grating
(MEG) were found using the tool tg create mask from the level 1 data products. The tool
tg resolve events was used to assign the grating events and necessary ﬁlters were applied
using dmcopy to create the level 2 event ﬁles. The standard PHA ﬁles were extracted using
the tool tgextract from the level 2 event ﬁle. This task created spectra of diﬀerent orders
(i.e., ±1, ±2 and ±3) from both HEG and MEG. Necessary Response Matrix Files (RMFs)
and Ancillary Response Files (ARFs) were produced using the tasks mkgrmf and fullgarf.
Chandra localization of the source was performed using the task wavdetect.

2.3. NuSTAR

The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) is a space-based X-ray satellite
that operates in the energy range of 3–79 keV. It has two detector units – FPMA and FPMB

(Focal Plane Modules – A and B) each located at the focus of two co-aligned optics units.
Each detector unit is comprised of four segments made of Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe
or CZT) having a rectangular shape of dimension 20mm×20mm×2mm, gridded into 32×32
pixels. Each detector has angular resolutions of 58′′ Half Power Diameter (HPD) and 18′′
Full-width at Half-Maximum (FWHM). Energy resolution of each telescope is 0.4 keV at 6
keV and 0.9 keV at 60 keV respectively with 13′×13′ ﬁeld of view (Harrison et al. 2013).

NuSTAR performed three observations towards MAXI J1348–630 during the HS of the
outburst for 13.8 ks, 15.4 ks and 17.2 ks exposure time (Obs Ids – 80502304002, 80502304004
and 80502304006 respectively). Summary of the NuSTAR observation is given in Table 1.
NUPIPELINE tool was used to produce the level 2 data from which we have extracted light
images and spectra using the tool NUPRODUCTS provided by NUSTARDAS package.
curves,
Data processing has been done using HEASOFT v 6.25 software with the recent version of
the calibration database.

Interday variation of the spectral parameters of the source during the decaying phase of
the outburst was studied using NuSTAR data. Spectra were plotted and models were ﬁtted
using XSPEC v 12.10.1 (Arnaud 1996). Spectra were plotted in the energy range 3–78 keV,
because outside this range photon statistics were not very signiﬁcant. We tried diﬀerent
models to ﬁt the spectra that were discussed in the result section. The summary of ﬁtted
spectral parameters is given in Table 4.

Station (ISS) is dedicated mainly to study neutron stars. The primary instrument of NICER

is the X-ray Timing Instrument (XTI) which is an array of 56 X-ray photon detectors that
collect photons in the energy range 0.2–12 keV (Gendreau et al. 2016). After the discovery
of MAXI J1348–630, NICER performed multiple observations towards the source. We used
the observation of 20 June 2019 (Obs Id – 2200530160) for the study of the power spectral
properties of the source. We performed NICERL2 to apply the standard NICER calibrations
and standard screening. We have applied barycenter correction by performing BARYCORR
using ICRS as the reference frame. Light curves have been extracted using the barycenter
corrected event ﬁle in XSELECT v 2.4e with diﬀerent bin sizes of 1 sec, 0.1 sec, 0.01 sec etc.

2.5. Swift

The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is a multi-wavelength observatory that operates in
a wide range of energies including optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-ray wavebands by
three diﬀerent instruments onboard it. The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) operates in the
energy range of 15 to 150 keV which detects any event and the corresponding location in
the sky (Barthelmy et al. 2005). BAT use to monitor the whole sky regularly. We used
daily monitoring data of Swift/BAT (15–50 keV) to plot the light curve (Figure 2) and HID
(Figure 5).

The X-ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Swift operates in the energy range 0.3 to 10 keV to
study diﬀerent spectral properties of the source (Burrows et al. 2000). Since the resolution
of XRT is better than that of BAT, it is often used to determine the location of any source
with higher accuracy. We performed XRTPIPELINE using the level 1 event ﬁles and image ﬁles
from the archived data to produce re-calibrated cleaned level 2 data products. We selected a
source region and a background region using the imaging tool DS9. Using these calibrated,
light curves,
screened event ﬁles and regions ﬁles, we extracted high-level products (i.e.
spectra and image ﬁles) from the task XRTPRODUCTS. The XRT spectrum in the energy range
0.9–9 keV was included in the broadband spectrum of Figure 10.

Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) operates in both UV and visible regions with
six diﬀerent ﬁlters in it (1928–5468 ˚A) (Poole et al. 2008). We used three diﬀerent UVOT
observations performed on MJD 58606, MJD 58609 and MJD 58612 for the study of broad-
band spectrum. Observation logs and a list of ﬁlters used during the observations were
shown in Table 1. We checked if the UVOT image ﬁles were aspect corrected or not using
the task FKEYPRINT. Since the correction was previously performed, we run UVOTDETECT for
the source location on the UVOT sky image. We choose the source region to be a circle of
radius 10′′ around the source and the background region having an annulus shape with an
inner and outer radius of 20′′ and 30′′ respectively keeping the source at the centre for each

– 8 –

observation. We performed the routine UVOTSOURCE to examine the photometry of the source
keeping the background threshold 5σ. The results were used in the broadband spectrum in
Figure 10.

We have used the monitoring data of Swift/BAT (15–50 keV) and MAXI/GSC (2–20
keV) to study the temporal variation of ﬂux during the outbursts. To study the hardness
evolution, we have used MAXI/GSC data in the energy ranges 2–6 keV and 6–20 keV.
We studied the Power Density Spectrum (PDS) of the source using the tool POWSPEC over
diﬀerent phases of the outburst. To ﬁnd the presence of QPOs, we have analysed diﬀerent
observations of Swift, NuSTAR and NICER data during diﬀerent phases of two outbursts.
PDS is studied using the task POWSPEC for diﬀerent bin sizes like 10 sec, 1 sec, 0.1 sec and
0.01 sec. We used the LCMATH tool for the background correction. The hardness intensity
diagram was plotted using MAXI/GSC hardness (6–20 keV/2–6 keV) and Swift/BAT ﬂux
(15–50 keV).

3. Results

3.1. Chandra and NuSTAR localization

On 26 January 2019, the new X-ray transient MAXI J1348–630 was discovered by
MAXI/GSC and the measured position of the source was RA=13h48m12s, Dec=–63◦04′04′′
(J2000) with 90 per cent C.L. elliptical error region having semi-major and semi-minor
axes of 0.42◦ and 0.34◦ respectively (Yatabe et al. 2019). Later, Denisenko et al. (2019)
found the optical counterpart of MAXI J1348–630 using the iTelescope.Net T31 instrument
and determined the position of the source as RA=13h48m12.88s, Dec=–63◦16′28.4′′ (J2000).
Using an 1 ks Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation with Swift, Kennea & Negoro (2019)
found a bright source located at RA=13h48m12.73s, Dec=–63◦16′26.8′′ (J2000) with 1.7′′
error radius (90 per cent conﬁdence).

Chandra observed the black hole MAXI J1348–630 on 21 June 2019 with 19 ks exposure.
Analysis of Chandra data revealed a bright point source located at RA=13h48m12.883s,
Dec=–63◦16′28.82′′ (J2000) with an error circle of 0.5′′ (90 per cent conﬁdence). The position
of the source measured by Chandra was about 2.16′′ away from the position measured by
Swift/XRT. The position of the source found from the optical counterpart lies only 0.36′′
away from the Chandra measured position.

3.2. Temporal variations of X-ray emission

The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift3 and Gas Slit Camera (GSC) onboard
MAXI4 are continuously monitoring the source from its discovery. Two subsequent outbursts
occurred in April and June 2019 after the giant outburst in January 2019 (when the source
was discovered). In this study, we have focused on the later two outbursts (i.e., the outburst
of April and June 2019) that occurred between MJD 58596 and MJD 58709, covering approx-
imately 113 days. Light curves using daily monitoring data of Swift/BAT and MAXI/GSC
is shown in Figure 2. Variation of ﬂux from the source observed by MAXI/GSC in 2–20 keV
is shown in the upper panel (in red) and that using Swift/BAT in 15–50 keV is shown in the
lower panel (in blue).

The April 2019 outburst of a relatively smaller magnitude (compared to the outburst
of January) started at the end of April 2019 (MJD 58596) and continued for almost 17 days
before the decaying phase of the giant outburst of January reached its quiescent level. The
ﬂux reached the peak value 0.32±0.01 Crab on MJD 58604 as measured by Swift/BAT (15–
50 keV) and 0.211±0.005 Crab on MJD 58601.5 as measured by MAXI/GSC (2–20 keV).
The outburst observed in 15–50 keV by Swift/BAT was comparatively more prominent than
that observed in 2–20 keV by MAXI/GSC.

The next outburst (outburst of June 2019) with a relatively larger magnitude compared
to that of April was started in June 2019 (MJD 58630 approx) as observed by Swift/BAT.
The outburst continued for almost 70 days and during the outburst, the ﬂux reached the
peak (0.83±0.03 Crab) on MJD 58653 as observed by Swift/BAT in the energy range of
15–50 keV. The peak ﬂux measured by MAXI/GSC in 2–20 keV was 0.35±0.07 Crab on
MJD 58654.5.

The source showed the variability of diﬀerent time scales. Many micro-ﬂaring activities
were detected. In Figure 3, we have shown an example of a micro-ﬂare of ∼15 s duration that
has been detected using NuSTAR data (Obs Id – 80502304002) on MJD 58655. The source
shows a sharp rise and relatively slow decay, which is the typical nature of a micro-ﬂare. It
took ∼5 sec to reach from 212 count s−1 to 486 count s−1 and ∼10 sec to come back to the
base value.

3.3. Hardness evolution

The Hardness Ratio (HR) of the source during two successive outbursts of April and
June were shown in Figure 4 where HR for two outbursts were plotted in diﬀerent panels. In
both ﬁgures, the upper and the middle panel showed the variations of ﬂuxes in the energy
range 2–6 keV and 6–20 keV of MAXI/GSC respectively. Each point on these two plots
represented the one day averaged count rate. The bottom panels showed the evolution of
hardness (6–20 keV/2–6 keV) during the outbursts which indicated the transitions of the
source through diﬀerent spectral states.

The left side ﬁgure showed the variations of ﬂux and hardness that have been plotted
over 30 days (from MJD 58590 to MJD 58620) during the outburst of April. The source rose
and decayed in 6–20 keV but was in the declining phase, continuing the earlier outburst of
January 2019 in 2–6 keV. Initially, the source was observed to remain in the SS before the
initiation of the outburst, but during the outburst, the source made a transition to the HS.

In the right-side ﬁgure, the variation of ﬂux in the energy ranges 2–6 keV and 6–20
keV and their hardness evolution were plotted for 90 days (from MJD 58620 to MJD 58710)
during the June 2019 outburst using MAXI/GSC data. Variation of ﬂux was observed in
both soft and hard energy bands.

HID for the outburst of April 2019 was shown in Figure 5. The hardness ratio (6–20
keV/2–6 keV) was plotted using MAXI/GSC data while the ﬂux was measured by Swift/BAT
in 15–50 keV. In the HID, the spectral state transitions of the black hole MAXI J1348–630
were shown during the outburst of April (from MJD 58596 to MJD 58614). Earlier, the source
made a transition from HS to SS during the outburst of January 2019 after its discovery
(Tominaga et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). It remained in the SS until MJD 58597 and the
second outburst happened (outburst of April 2019) and it started to make a transition from
SS to HS. At the end of the second outburst (on MJD 58608), it completely reached HS and
returned to quiescence. The track shown in the HID indicated these state transitions during
the April 2019 outburst.

3.4. Power Density Spectra

The evolution of power spectral properties was studied during two outbursts. We studied
the PDS using the archival data of Swift, NuSTAR and NICER to investigate the possible
presence of QPOs during this period. We detected a low-frequency QPO at 0.82 Hz from
NICER observation (Obs Id – 2200530160) on MJD 58654 with a bin size of 0.1 sec. The
observation was made during the outburst of June when the source was in the HS. In Figure

Fig. 4.— Evolution of ﬂux during the two consecutive outbursts at diﬀerent energy bands as
well as the variation of hardness using MAXI/GSC data are shown. In both plots, the upper
and the middle panels show the variations of ﬂux towards the source in the energy ranges
2–6 keV and 6–20 keV respectively. The bottom panel shows the evolution of hardness (6–20
keV/2–6 keV) of the photons during the outburst. In the left ﬁgure, the ﬂux is negligible
for soft photons whereas that for hard photons is comparatively much prominent. Variation
of hardness from soft to hard is also detected indicating a state transition.
In the right
ﬁgure, the ﬂuxes in the diﬀerent energy ranges are comparatively stronger than those in
the previous one. The outburst was equally dominated by the soft and hard photons. No
evidence of state transition is observed from the hardness ratio plot during the outburst of
June 2019.

6, the ﬁtted PDS of the source using NICER observation was shown. The PDS is well ﬁtted
with a combined model of constant, power-law and a Lorentzian. The ﬁtted model gave the
RMS value of 7.6 per cent and Q-value (ν/F W HM) = 6.83. We detected another QPO at
0.67 Hz using NuSTAR data (Obs Id – 80502304002) on MJD 58655 with an RMS value of
2.1 per cent and a Q-value of 5.58.

The centroid frequencies of QPOs decreased from 0.82 Hz to 0.67 Hz and the RMS
dropped from 7.6 per cent to 2.1 per cent on a time scale of 1 day. The change in RMS
is because the PDS is studied in two diﬀerent energy ranges of NICER (0.2–12 keV) and
NuSTAR (3-80 keV). NICER measured counts of soft photons, whereas NuSTAR measured
that for hard photons. The source remained in the HS during these two observations. For
this reason, the average count rate of hard photons was higher than that of soft photons.
RMS of a QPO is inversely proportional to the square root of the mean count rate. Because
of all these reasons, the RMS measured by NuSTAR was less than that measured by NICER.

3.5. Study of Chandra grating spectrum

We studied the high-resolution Chandra/HETG spectrum using the HEG-1 product.
For this study, we used data of 21 June 2019 (Obs Id – 21239) near the peak of the outburst
of June 2019. Multiple emission and absorption features were present in the spectrum. For
this reason, we divided the whole spectrum into two diﬀerent energy ranges to study them
properly. The ﬁrst spectrum was plotted in 1–2 keV and the other was plotted in the energy
range of 2.3–6 keV. Absorption lines of high signiﬁcance were observed in both spectra.

The spectrum in the energy range 1–2 keV was shown in the left of Figure 7. The
spectrum was ﬁtted with the model phabs, accounting for the photoelectric absorption,
along with a power-law. Three absorption lines were visible in the spectrum and some dips
were also present on the residuals. We added three Gaussian absorption components (gabs).
From the model, the absorption features were obtained at 1.078 keV, 1.75 keV and 1.85
keV which correspond to the absorption lines of Fe XXII, Fe XXIII and Si XII respectively.
The combined model gave the reduced χ2=1.34 for 2596 degrees of freedom. After ﬁtting
three absorption components in the model, there was some emission like features in the
residual near ∼1.5 keV and ∼1.8 keV. We added two Gaussian emission components at
these speciﬁc positions. The Gaussian lines were obtained at 1.5 keV and 1.81 keV and after
the introduction of these two emission lines, the ﬁtting improved signiﬁcantly with reduced
χ2=0.88 for 2592 degrees of freedom. The emission lines at 1.5 keV and 1.81 keV corresponds
to Fe XXI and Fe XXIII emission lines respectively.

The spectrum in the energy range 2.3–6 keV was shown in the right of Figure 7. Since
this spectrum was dominated by blackbody radiation from the accretion disk, we ﬁtted it
with a bbody model. In this spectrum, multiple absorption features were evident from the
residual as well as the spectrum also. We added three Gaussian absorption components at
2.73 keV, 3.22 keV and 3.32 keV which correspond to absorption lines of Cl XVI, S XV
and Ar XVIII respectively. The reduced χ2 value for the combined model was 1.38 for
1319 degrees of freedom. There was a clear hump-like feature near 3.6 keV observed from
the residuals. To compensate for this, we added a Gaussian emission component at that
position. As a result, the reduced χ2 changed to 1.003 for 1317 degrees of freedom. This
Gaussian emission line at 3.6 keV corresponds to the emission line of Ar XVI. All absorption
and emission features were identiﬁed from the online spectral plotting facility of AtomDB5.

3.6. Evolution of spectral parameters

Spectra of the source MAXI J1348–630 were studied using NuSTAR/FPMA data that
were collected over three epochs during the decaying phase of the June 2019 outburst. During
theese three observations, the source remained in the HS. Spectra were plotted in the energy
range 3–78 keV. We studied the variation of spectral parameters by ﬁtting all NuSTAR spec-
tra from diﬀerent observations. The spectra were ﬁtted with a photoelectric absorption model
tbabs (Wilms, Allen & McCray 2000) with a thermal Comptonisation component (nthcomp;
Zdziarski, Johnson & Magdziarz (1996); ˙Zycki, Done & Smith (1999)) for the Comptonised
hard photons. We added a blackbody component to take into account the blackbody emis-
sion from the accretion disk. By ﬁtting with this model the value of reduced χ2 was 1.23 for
1869 degrees of freedom with a clear hump near 6.4 keV in the residual indicating the Fe-Kα
emission line. The ﬁt statistics enhanced signiﬁcantly on adding a Gaussian component at
6.4 keV. Earlier, we ﬁtted the spectra with a broken power-law instead of nthcomp in the
above-said model. The ﬁt statistic was not good enough and the model failed to resolve
the Fe-Kα line in each spectrum. The iron emission line at 6.4 keV was resolved from each
spectrum after using the nthcomp model. Figure 8 showed the spectrum with the best-ﬁtted
model and the residuals of the source using NuSTAR/FPMA data (Obs Id – 80502304006)
that gave reduced χ2 = 1.09 for 1867 degrees of freedom. Evolution of spectral parameters
over the outburst were shown in Table 4. During the ﬁtting of the NuSTAR spectra, we
ﬁxed the value of hydrogen column density (nH ) at 0.86×1022 cm−2, previously determined
by Tominaga et al. (2020) from the Swift/XRT spectrum (1–10 keV).

Throughout the outburst of June 2019, the spectra were hard and suﬃcient photon was
present at 78 keV which indicated the possibility of the presence of hard tails extending
up to a few hundred keV. The photon index was almost constant (Γ ∼ 1.59) over three
epochs of NuSTAR observations. The average temperature due to blackbody radiation was
∼0.7 keV. Previously, Tominaga et al. (2020) found the inner disk temperature was ∼0.75
keV during the canonical SS of January 2019 outburst. The spectra were mainly dominated
by hard Comptonised photons during the outburst. On the ﬁrst NuSTAR observation (on
MJD 58655), the contribution of thermally Comptonised ﬂux to the total ﬂux (Fnthc/Ftot)
was ∼70 per cent which increased to 80 per cent on the third observation (on MJD 58672).
But, the contribution of Comptonised ﬂux to total ﬂux on MJD 58660 was signiﬁcantly
less (∼53 per cent) reason of which is unclear. The blackbody normalization also decreased
during this period indicating the lowering of emission of disk photons. At the same time,
the increase in electron temperature upscattered the seed photons, increasing their energies
beyond the energy of typical seed photons. As a result, the majority of seed photons were
getting upscattered by inverse Comptonisation and dominated the spectra. Total ﬂux also
decreased as the observations were performed on the decaying phase of the outburst.

3.7. Continuum Image of MAXI J1348–630 using ALMA

We detected the continuum emission from black hole MAXI J1348–630 between the
frequency range of 89.56–351.44 GHz with ALMA band 3, 4, 6 and 7 observations. The
measured disk average ﬂux densities in diﬀerent frequencies varies between 12.18 to 18.47
mJy. The continuum images at diferent frequencies of MAXI J1348–630 were shown in Figure
1. The phase center of the continuum image of MAXI J1348–630 was RA=13h48m12.790s,
Dec=–63◦16′28.480′′ (J2000). In continuum images, the beam sizes were 1.22′′×0.97′′ for 104
GHz, 1.22′′×0.97′′ for 138 GHz, 0.58′′×0.44′′ for 242 GHz, and 0.35′′×0.29′′ for 343 GHz.
The source was not resolved in any of the images indicating size of the radio emitting region
was less than 0.29′′.

The resultant radio continuum spectrum of black hole MAXI J1348–630 was shown in
Figure 9. The continuum radio spectrum showed the ﬂat nature with spectral index (α)
= 0.324±0.003 (assuming Fν ∝ να). The slope of the spectrum was positive in the radio
region, indicating that the synchrotron radiation was from an optically thick region and
the self-absorption frequency was more than 351.4 GHz. The ALMA measurements were
included in the broadband spectrum of Figure 10.

We looked for molecular line emission from the surrounding of the source, as was earlier
found for the case of Galactic black holes GRS 1758–258 and 1E 1740.7–2942 (Tetarenko et al.
2020). No molecular lines were detected indicating that there was not enough molecular gas
in the vicinity of MAXI J1348–630.

3.8. Broadband spectrum

We presented here a Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) over a multi-wavelength region
of the black hole MAXI J1348–630 to get an overall idea about the emission mechanism from
diﬀerent emitting regions. The broadband SED was studied in a wide range of energy from
radio to X-ray including ultraviolet and optical wavebands during the outburst of April 2019.
In Figure 10, we showed the broadband spectrum of the source using close-simultaneous
observations. All observations were made between 2 and 3 May of 2019 when the source
was close to the peak of the outburst of April 2019. The ALMA observation was started at
03:06 UT on 2 May 2019 (MJD 58605.13) from which the radio emission from the compact
jets was studied using diﬀerent wavebands (band 3, 4, 6 and 7) with frequencies ranging
from 89.56 GHz to 351.44 GHz. Swift observations corresponding to 3 May 2019 (MJD
58606) was used. Fluxes in the Ultraviolet region were taken from the UVOT observations
performed on 3 May 2019. UVOT observations were carried out with uvw2 and uvm2 ﬁlters
having central wavelength (λ) of 1928 ˚A and 2246 ˚A respectively. The X-ray ﬂux in 0.9–9
keV was included using data of XRT onboard Swift.

The optical ﬂux was included from Swift/UVOT data that was performed with the
u ﬁlter (λ = 3465 ˚A) on 9 May 2019 for reference. We also indicated another optical
photometry from Gaia DR2 catalogue (Brown et al. 2018) in the plot for comparison. The
source remained undetected through UVOT observations of u, uvm2 and uvw2 bands and
we mentioned 5σ upper limits of the source. The ﬂux measured by the Gaia catalogue
(Brown et al. 2018) remained below these upper limits and was consistent with our study.

The broadband spectrum was studied when the source was in the intermediate state,
making a transition from SS to HS, near the peak of the April 2019 outburst during the

– 20 –

decay phase. The source was strong in X-ray indicating strong blackbody radiation from the
disk. In the region of radio wavelength, the spectrum was ﬂat. Fitting the ALMA spectrum,
we obtained α = 0.324 ± 0.003 (assuming Fν ∝ να) as measured on 2 May 2019. The low
radio emission from jets indicated weak synchrotron emission from an optically thick regime.
The low radio ﬂux from MAXI J1348–630 categorized itself as “radio-quite” micro-quasar.

Due to the lack of suﬃcient photons in the mid-energy region, we did not ﬁt the whole
spectrum. But the X-ray spectrum in the range 0.9–8 keV is well described separately with
the best-ﬁtted model using the Swift/XRT observation of 3 May 2019 (MJD 58606.39). The
model constituted a photo-electric absorbed power-law with a spectral index of 2.2. The
emission of soft X-ray photons was dominated by thermal blackbody radiation from the
innermost region of the accretion disk with a disk temperature of 0.27±0.02 keV.

The averaged X-ray ﬂux during the April outburst was 2.94×10−9 erg cm−2 s−1 in
0.9–8 keV on MJD 58606.39. The quasi-simultaneous radio ﬂuxes were 12.18–18.47 mJy
(or 1.18×10−14 – 6.46×10−14 erg cm−2 s−1) as measured by ALMA band-3, 4, 6 and 7 at
frequencies ranging between 97–350 GHz on MJD 58605.13–58605.19.

We have compared our result with results of Carotenuto et al. (2019) and Chauhan et al.
(2019) which were studied during the outburst of January 2019. On MJD 58523.21, the
radio ﬂux at 1.28 GHz was 520.3±5.0 mJy or 6.67×10−15 erg cm−2 s−1 as observed by
MeerKAT (Carotenuto et al. 2019). In another radio observation by Murchison Wideﬁeld
Array (MWA) telescope on MJD 58523.79, ﬂuxes at 154 MHz and 216 MHz were 301±21
mJy (4.64×10−16 erg cm−2 s−1) and 362±22 mJy (7.82×10−16 erg cm−2 s−1) respectively
(Chauhan et al. 2019). The quasi-simultaneous X-ray ﬂux on MJD 58523.44 by Swift/XRT
(Obs Id – 00011107006) in the energy range 1–10 keV was 1×10−8 erg cm−2 s−1. Although
the source was bright in radio and X-ray bands, the radio ﬂux compared to X-ray ﬂux was
signiﬁcantly less during the January 2019 outburst which is observed during the outburst of
April 2019 also.

4. Discussions

In this work, we studied multi-wavelength observations of the black hole MAXI J1348–
630 using ALMA, Chandra, NICER, Swift and NuSTAR during its two successive outbursts
in April and June 2019.

Earlier, the source went to SS near MJD 58530 during the outburst of January 2019 and
remained in that state until MJD 58597 (Tominaga et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). After
remaining in the SS for approximately 67 days, it evolved through the intermediate states

Fig. 10.— Broadband spectrum of the source MAXI J1348–630 from radio to X-ray band.
The millimetre radio ﬂux has been taken by analysing ALMA data which is shown by red
circles. Ultraviolet and X-ray ﬂuxes are included from UVOT and XRT data onboard the
Swift observatory. The upper limit of the ultraviolet ﬂux is denoted by a down arrow. The
X-ray ﬂux is shown by the blue points at the top right corner. The optical photometry has
been taken from the Gaia DR2 catalogue, indicated by violet asterisk (Brown et al. 2018).

and reached the HS at the end of the outburst. The transition from SS to HS started when
the luminosity of the source was about 7.3 per cent of the peak luminosity of the outburst
of January 2019. During the June 2019 outburst, the source remained in the canonical
HS throughout the outburst (Zhang et al. 2020). Similar re-brightening was also observed
in another new X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 and during the re-outburst, it also did
not show any state transition (Stiele & Kong 2020). During the outburst of June of MAXI
J1348–630, the peak luminosity was 1.89×1037 erg s−1 (assuming the source distance to be
4 kpc according to Tominaga et al. (2020)), which is 13.6 per cent the peak luminosity of
the January 2019 outburst.

The accretion mechanism around a BHXRB is still not understood properly. Multi-
wavelength observations are key to understand the emission mechanisms from diﬀerent re-
gions of BHXRB during outbursts (viz. Ueda et al. (2002); Chakrabarti et al. (2005)). While
the sources of X-ray and radio wavelength radiation are well understood, the origin of mid-
energy emissions in the infra-red, ultraviolet and visible wavebands are rather complicated to
understand (van Paradijs & McClintock 1995; Chakrabarti, Pal & Nandi 2006), since mul-
tiple radiation mechanisms occur at diﬀerent regions of the system. The soft X-rays are
believed to come from the inner-most regions of the accretion disk, whereas the ultraviolet
and optical emissions are thought to come from the irradiated outer thin accretion disks
(Poutanen & Veledina 2014). Origin of the hard X-rays may be due to inverse Compton-
isation of the disk photons by the electron clouds around the black hole called “Corona”
(Done et al. 2007). Radio emissions are originated due to Synchrotron emission from the
jets (Falcke & Biermann 1996, 1999).

In this multi-wavelength study, we observed that the emission of the X-ray from the disk
is much stronger than the emission in the radio wavelength. This implies that the emission
from the source is dominated by the blackbody radiation from the accretion disk associated
with weak synchrotron emission from the optically thick regime around the compact jets.
Mis-aligned jets may be the reason for low radio luminosity (Miller-Jones et al. 2019). Self-
absorption frequency was more than 351.4 GHz as observed from the radio observations.

The emission in the mid energy region, i.e., in the ultraviolet and optical wavelength was
signiﬁcantly less as usually observed in X-ray binaries. This was probably due to the heavy
extinction as dust and matters are accumulated around the system (Zwitter, Calvani & D’Odorico
1991; Paragi et al. 1999). Earlier, some multi-wavelength observations were performed in
other sources to study the accretion phenomenon around them. The same nature of radio
weak and X-ray strong, as observed in MAXI J1348–630 during April 2019 outburst, were
also observed in GRS 1915+105 (Ueda et al. 2002), GX 339–4 (Cadolle et al. 2011) etc. In
the study of a multi-wavelength campaign (April 2002) of the micro-quasar GRS 1915+105,

– 23 –

Ueda et al. (2002) found that radio emissions from jets were relatively weak whereas the
X-rays emitted from the disk were much stronger. The same nature of SED was observed
in the LMXB GX 339–4 during the outburst of 2010 (Cadolle et al. 2011). But during the
broadband study of the HMXB SS 433, Chakrabarti et al. (2005) noticed that source is re-
markably strong in radio wavelength but with the increase in energy, the ﬂux was drastically
decreasing in the infra-red, optical, ultraviolet region and signiﬁcantly less in X-ray.

BHXRBs show variabilities on diﬀerent time scales.

In BHXRBs, diﬀerent types of
QPOs are present in the PDS associated with some noise components in diﬀerent phases of
the outburst (Casella, Belloni & Stella 2005; Motta 2016). Type-A QPOs are relatively rare
to observe in BHXRBs. They appear with broader and ﬂat peaks in 4–8 Hz and typically
observed in the SS, when the variability reaches the minimum (fractional RMS of few per
cent) (Homan et al. 2001). Since the fundamental peak itself is weak and appear with a
wide range of frequency, harmonics are not generally observed. Type-B QPOs are found
during the SIMS of an outburst. They usually appear with sharp peaks and narrow widths
and found at around 6 Hz (Casella et al. 2004; Motta et al. 2011; Sriram, Rao & Choi 2013;
Motta 2016; Stevans & Uttley 2016). Harmonics and sub-harmonics are often present in the
PDS. The most common type of QPOs observed in BHXRBs are Type C QPOs. They are
also observed with strong peak and narrow width typically found within a few mHz to 30
Hz (Casella et al. 2004; Motta et al. 2011; Motta 2016). They are observed in the HS and
HIMS, generally appears with harmonic and sub-harmonics in the PDS.

In our study, we found the PDS was characterized by strong band-limited noise with
RMS variability of 31.4 ± 0.5 per cent on MJD 58654 which is typically found in the HS of a
BHXRB. The decrease in QPO frequency, RMS and quality factors are quite common in the
decaying phase of the outburst of a BHXRB. Positions of the QPOs, RMS and quality factor
suggested that those were similar to type-C QPOs, typically observed in the HS of an ac-
creting BHXRB (Motta 2016). Type C QPOs were also observed previously from this source
at diﬀerent frequencies during the outburst of January 2019 (Jana et al. 2020; Zhang et al.
2020). The variation in QPO frequency indicated a certain change in oscillation near the
Comptonising regions (Chakrabarti, Acharyya & Molteni 2004) or may be due to the change
in perturbation inside the Keplerian disk (Trudolyubov, Churazov & Gilfanov 1999). The
origin of QPOs from BHXRBs is still a subject of debate. Multiple models are proposed to ex-
plain the origin of type-C QPOs. They are believed to originate due to relativistic precession
of the inner-most regions of a cool and optically thick truncated disk (Shakura & Sunyaev
1973; Ingram, Done & Fragile 2009) or due to instabilities of accretion disks around the
compact object as a result of magneto-acoustic oscillation (Titarchuk & Fiorito 2004).

In the HS of BHXRBs, the energy spectra are strongly dominated by Comptonised emis-

– 24 –

sion with a weak and cool thermal component emitted from truncated disks (Done et al.
2007). Whereas in SS, emissions are characterized by strong thermal blackbody radia-
tion from the disk and the eﬀect of Comptonisation becomes minimum. During this state,
the inner disk radius sometimes extends up to the innermost stable circular orbit (Tanaka
1989; Ebisawa et al. 1993; Steiner et al. 2010). The energy spectra are almost equally dom-
inated by both blackbody and Comptonisation components during the intermediate states.
During the transition towards harder states, the Comptonisation component starts domi-
nating the spectra and ﬂuxes are mostly due to the hard photons (Takahashi et al. 2008;
Makishima et al. 2008). During the NuSTAR observations, the source remained entirely in
the HS and the energy spectra were strongly dominated by the thermal Comptonisation
component as observed from the study of the spectral evolution. Over three epochs of NuS-
TAR observations, when the source moved towards the quiescence, the ﬂux of Comptonised
photons increased indicating the spectral hardening nature.

During the HS, the spectral index (Γ) remained almost constant at ∼1.6. The corre-
sponding blackbody temperature also remained almost constant at ∼ 0.7 keV which was
comparatively small when the luminosity was near to the maximum (in the order of 1037 erg
s−1) during the outburst of June 2019. The luminosity of the source depends on the tem-
perature and radius of the source as L ∝ R2T 4. According to the equation, a cool disk and
high luminosity indicate a relatively larger disk radius. The large radius suggests that the
source is massive compared to most of the known Galactic black holes. Also, the tempera-
ture of a standard accretion disk is inversely proportional to the black hole mass, T ∝ M −1/4
(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Zhang et al. 2020). During the NuSTAR observations, the lower
disk temperature of the source indicated that the system may hosts a relatively high mass
black hole as stated earlier by Tominaga et al. (2020) and Jana et al. (2020).

5. Conclusion

We summarized the result of diﬀerent timing and spectral properties of the X-ray bi-
nary black hole MAXI J1348–630 during its two consecutive outbursts of April and June
2019 occurred between MJD 58596 and MJD 58710. A study of hardness evolution showed
the hardness ratio was rapidly varying during the outburst of April 2019 indicating a state
transition from SS to HS and the hardness ratio remained almost constant during the out-
burst of June 2019. The power density spectra were dominated by strong band-limited noise
components with typical RMS variability of ∼30 per cent. Type-C QPO of 6.83σ was de-
tected on MJD 58654 using NICER data (0.2–12 keV) at frequency 0.82 Hz with 7.6 per
cent RMS amplitude. Another QPO of 5.58σ was detected on MJD 58655 from NuSTAR

– 25 –

data (3–80 keV) at 0.67 Hz with an RMS amplitude of 2.1 per cent. A rapid decrease in
RMS indicated a certain geometrical change in corona. We measured the improved source
location at RA=13h48m12.883s, Dec=–63◦16′28.82′′ (J2000) using Chandra HETG obser-
vation. We studied the broadband spectrum of the black hole using the ﬂuxes in radio,
optical, ultraviolet and X-ray energy bands during the outburst of April 2019 to understand
the emission from diﬀerent regions of the system at diﬀerent wavelengths. The broadband
spectrum suggested that the disk emission was much stronger than the emission from the
jets. Heavy extinction in the optical/UV region was observed. This was probably due to
the presence of matter or dust that were accumulated around the system. Chandra/HETG
spectrum was studied from which multiple broad Gaussian absorption lines and some weak
emission lines were detected. The evolution of spectral parameters was also studied using
three diﬀerent observations of NuSTAR during the June 2019 outburst. The best ﬁt model
suggested that the spectra were mainly dominated by the thermally Comptonised photons as
usually observed in the HS of a BHXRB. Signature of iron Kα emission lines were detected
from all three NuSTAR spectra.
