ABSTRACT

Observational pre-cursors of large solar ﬂares provide a basis for future operational systems for
forecasting. Here, we study the evolution of the normalized emergence (EM), shearing (SH) and total
(T) magnetic helicity ﬂux components for 14 ﬂaring with at least one X-class ﬂare) and 14 non-ﬂaring
(< M5-class ﬂares) active regions (ARs) using the Spaceweather Helioseismic Magnetic Imager Active
Region Patches vector magnetic ﬁeld data. Each of the selected ARs contain a δ-type spot. The
three helicity components of these ARs were analyzed using wavelet analysis. Localised peaks of the
wavelet power spectrum (WPS) were identiﬁed and statistically investigated. We ﬁnd that:
i) the
probability density function of the identiﬁed WPS peaks for all the EM, SH and T proﬁles can be
ﬁtted with a set of Gaussian functions centered at distinct periods between ∼ 3 to 20 hours. ii) There
is a noticeable diﬀerence in the distribution of periods found in the EM proﬁles between the ﬂaring
and non-ﬂaring ARs, while no signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found in the SH and T proﬁles.
iii) In ﬂaring
ARs, the distributions of the shorter EM/SH/T periods (< 10 hrs) split up into two groups after ﬂares,
iv) When the EM periodicity does not contain
while the longer periods (> 10 hrs) do not change.
harmonics, the ARs do not host a large energetic ﬂare. Finally, v) signiﬁcant power at long periods
(∼ 20 hour) in the T and EM components may serve as pre-cursor for large energetic ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION

The interaction of solar activity with Earth’s atmo-
sphere occurs through a complex series of events called
Space Weather (SW). The energetic solar ﬂares and
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) have dominant roles
in SW, because they can cause disruption to human
technology, e.g.
for the functioning of electric power
grids, aviation, radio communication, GPS, and space-
based facilities (Eastwood et al. 2017). For this reason,
it is vital to further develop existing prediction capa-
bilities through the identiﬁcation of observable precur-

sors of ﬂares and CMEs (see Barnes et al. 2016; Leka
et al. 2019; Kusano et al. 2020; Patsourakos et al. 2020;
Ahmadzadeh et al. 2021; Georgoulis, Manolis K. et al.
2021). Understanding the physical processes of ﬂare
and CME precursors is still a challenging task in so-
lar physics research (Florios et al. 2018; Kors´os et al.
2019, and in their references). The most intense solar
eruptions originate from the magnetically most complex,
and highly twisted δ-type active regions (ARs) (Geor-
goulis et al. 2019; Toriumi & Wang 2019). We employ
this working hypothesis, and focus on the observational
property of magnetic helicity ﬂux in δ-type ARs in this
work.

The source of magnetic helicity lies below the photo-
sphere, and can be derived from magnetogram obser-

vations of the photosphere. Certain properties of the
helicity are thought to be promising parameters to de-
scribe the pre-ﬂare states of ARs. This is, partially,
because the magnetic helicity ﬂux often has a strong
gradient before the ﬂare and CME occur (Elsasser 1956;
Moon et al. 2002a,b; Smyrli, A. et al. 2010; Park et al.
2008, 2012). The magnetic helicity carries information
about the complexity of the magnetic ﬁeld topology, and
is therefore linked to the free magnetic energy of ARs,
and the occurrence of ﬂares. Thus diagnostics related
to the magnetic helicity may be valuable for ﬂare pre-
diction (Pariat, E. et al. 2017; Thalmann et al. 2019;
Kors´os et al. 2020).

Recently, Prior et al. (2020) showed that the multi-
resolution wavelet decomposition is a useful tool to an-
alyze the magnetic helicity. Based on their theoretical
work, Kors´os et al. (2020) investigated the dynamic evo-
lution of emergence (EM), shearing (SH), and total (T)
magnetic helicity ﬂux terms using a wavelet analysis in
the case of three ﬂaring and three non-ﬂaring ARs. They
found a relationship between the oscillatory behavior of
the three magnetic helicity ﬂux components and the as-
sociated ﬂare activities. Their conjecture was that the
three helicity ﬂux components have common period(s)
before ﬂare onset. In comparison, the non-ﬂaring ARs
did not exhibit such common periodicities.

To further test the conjecture of Kors´os et al. (2020),
this work extends their approach by applying a more
extensive set of diagnostics on a larger number of ARs.
In this work, we investigate 14 ﬂaring and 14 non-ﬂaring
ARs, and apply additional statistical tests, e.g.:
the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, and the Gaussian Mix-
ture Model (GMM). The selection criteria of the studied
28 ARs are listed in Section 2. We describe the method
for the derivation of the magnetic helicity components
in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 presents the analysis and
summarises the main ﬁndings of our work.

2. DATA

In this study, similar to Kors´os et al. (2020), active
regions that contain X-class ﬂares will be called ﬂaring
ARs. While active regions that do not contain X-class
ﬂares are deﬁned as non-ﬂaring ARs. As in Kors´os et al.
(2020), a random sample of 14 ﬂaring and 14 non-ﬂaring
active regions are selected based on the following crite-
ria:

• the angular distance of an AR from the central
meridian is up to ±60◦, to obtain the best possible
quality data (Bobra et al. 2014).

• the AR must have a δ-spot conﬁguration.

Note—The ﬂaring ARs hosted at least one X-class ﬂare,
while the non-ﬂaring ARs produced ﬂares below M2.0-
class. All selected ARs contain a complex δ-type spot.

• the ﬂaring ARs must be the location of at least

one X-class ﬂare.

• the non-ﬂaring ARs should not be the host of ﬂares

larger than M5.

• the non-ﬂaring ARs cannot be associated with
fast CMEs. Here, we deﬁne CMEs with speeds
750 km s−1 or higher as a fast CME.

The selected 28 ARs are listed in Table 1, along with
the largest ﬂare intensity during the time of observation.
The non-ﬂaring ARs host ﬂares of intensity classes A,
B, and C except AR 11542 which produced one M1.6
ﬂare, and AR 11726 which produced one M1.0 ﬂare. The
M-class ﬂare intensities are at the boundary of what is
considered to be a truly energetic ﬂare.

3. CALCULATION OF THE MAGNETIC

HELICITY FLUX

Following Kors´os et al. (2020), we determine the EM,
SH, and T helicity ﬂux components, given by the terms
of equation (see, Berger 1984):
(cid:90)

(cid:90)

( (cid:126)Ap · (cid:126)Bh)(cid:126)v⊥zdS − 2

where (cid:126)Ap is the vector potential of the potential mag-
netic ﬁeld (cid:126)Bp. (cid:126)Bh, (cid:126)Bz, (cid:126)v⊥h and (cid:126)v⊥z are the tangential
and normal components of the magnetic ﬁeld and the
tangential and normal components of velocity, respec-
tively. On the right hand side of Eq. 1, the ﬁrst term
comes from the twisted magnetic ﬂux tubes emerging
into the solar atmosphere or also submerging into the
subsurface layer (emerging component, EM). The sec-
ond term comes from the shearing and braiding of the
ﬁeld lines, which is caused by the tangential motions on
the solar surface (shearing component, SH).

The helicity is estimated for each AR using the
Spaceweather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Active
Region Patches (SHARPs) vector magnetic ﬁeld mea-
surements (Bobra et al. 2014) with a cadence of 12 min-
utes (hmi.sharp cea 720s). The data is rebinned spa-
tially by a factor of four reduction in order to make the
code run faster.

Additional constraints are applied to mitigate the ar-
tiﬁcial 12- and 24-hr periods of the SDO/HMI magne-
togram measurements. Based on Smirnova et al. (2013),
the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is capped at a maxi-
mum of |±2000| G. We also impose a minimum threshold
of |±200| G, which is commonly used in the literature
(Tziotziou et al. 2015).

After the data binning and the applied constraints,
the photospheric plasma velocity is estimated by apply-
ing the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator for Vector
Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) algorithm with a 19-pixel
window (Schuck 2008). The vector potential (cid:126)Ap was
derived by the multigrid MUDPACK software (Adams
1993), solving the relevant elliptic partial diﬀerential
equations.

4. ANALYSIS

The wavelet power spectrum (WPS) is applied to both
original and smoothed time series of EM, SH, T. Similar
to Kors´os et al. (2020), the smoothed series are subject
to a smoothing window of 24 hrs that was subtracted
from the original data in order to further reduce the 12
and 24 hrs SDO artifact (Smirnova et al. 2013). Follow-
ing Kors´os et al. (2020), we employ the WPS algorithm
of Torrence & Compo (1998), using the default Morlet
wavelet. From the WPS, global power spectra (GPS)
are calculated through averaging the WPS over time.
We identify signiﬁcance in regions of the WPS based on
a 1σ level, estimated using a white noise model and the
standard deviation of the input signal.

In contrast with Kors´os et al. (2020), here, we identify
local maxima in the WPS by using an implementation of
the 0th dimensional persistent homology method (Hu-

ber 2021) from a Python package1. It is important to
note that we sought for peaks for signiﬁcance levels and
not for power. These peaks are shown as cyan-coloured
triangles for the case of AR 11430 in Figure 1. Only
signiﬁcant peaks inside the cone-of-inﬂuence are con-
sidered. These peaks are recorded for all 28 ARs, for
both the original and smoothed series of all three helic-
ity ﬂux components. As expected due to a consideration
of the wavelet decomposition at diﬀerent periods, there
are larger numbers of peaks at shorter periods (between
1 and 10 hours) whilst only a few peaks are detected at
longer periods.

4.1. Periodicity distribution of signiﬁcant peaks

The distribution of the identiﬁed WPS peaks are anal-
ysed with a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method.
Fig. 2 visualises the KDE analysis of the smoothed
EM/SH/T data and Figs. 2d-f show the GMM results.
In particular, Figs. 2a-c show the normalized Prob-
ability Density Function (PDF) of the identiﬁed peaks
as a function of periodicity. The PDF of ﬂaring ARs
are higher at shorter periods (0-10 hrs) than the non-
ﬂaring ones for the EM (Fig. 2a), and lower for the SH
(Fig. 2b). Based on Fig. 2a, the magnetic helicity ﬂux
EM indicates some level of diﬀerences for ﬂaring vs. non-
ﬂaring ARs, with p = 0.547. But, we also need to note
that p = 0.547 is still large and not statistically signif-
icant to reject the null hypothesis that the ﬂaring and
non-ﬂaring ARs have the same distribution of the WPS
peaks. However, the distribution of the WPS peaks are
the same in the case of SH and T, respectively, with the
p-values of 0.852 and 0.944. The PDFs of Fig. 2a-c show
bands of preferred periodicities between (i) 2–9 hours,
(ii) 11–14 hours, and (iii) 19–21 hours. We propose that
these bands could indicate some global harmonic prop-
erties of the EM, SH, and T ﬂuxes. To test this hypoth-
esis, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was performed to
compare the peak distributions of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring
ARs, with the results summarized in Table 2.

While performing the KS analysis, our null hypothesis
was that the similar periods are generated by the same
driving mechanism for both ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs.
From Table 2, we see that all of the p-values are below
1σ, which means that the null hypothesis is true. At this
stage, we do not know what exactly is the background
driving mechanism for these oscillatory behaviors in the
peak distributions of the three helicity ﬂuxes. There-
fore, since the null hypothesis is correct, we can assume

top panel shows the unsmoothed EM/SH/T time series in red/blue/orange, respectively. The middle row panels display the
WPS of the smoothed EM/SH/T helicity, while the bottom row panels depict the WPS of the unsmoothed time series. For each
wavelet, the contour lines mark the signiﬁcance levels (black at 68%, gray at 95%, and white at 98%), while the shaded color
corresponds to the power, as shown in the color bars. In the WPS plots, the thick black lines bounding the gridded regions show
the cone-of-inﬂuence, i.e., the domain where edge eﬀects become important. Peaks of local maxima within signiﬁcant regions,
identiﬁed using a homology method (see text), are shown by the cyan-coloured triangles. The plots to the right of each WPS
are the GPS, or the time-averaged WPS.

that ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs have the same global
harmonic properties.

Let us next focus on the KS test results of the T ﬂux.
It is not possible to distinguish between the two cases,
namely, ﬂaring vs. non-ﬂaring ARs. It is worth noting
that there is almost no change in the outcome of the KS
test results applied to T ﬂux whether using the original
or smoothed data. On the other hand, the results of
the KS test of the SH (Fig. 2b) and the EM (Fig. 2a)
ﬂuxes do reveal diﬀerent period bands in the ﬂaring and
non-ﬂaring ARs.

the corresponding distributions ﬁtted to a set of Gaussian functions. The number of Gaussian components are set to 5. The
1/n-dependence refers to a power law, where n = 1, 2, 3, ... is a positive integer, of the EM peaks of Gaussians is clearly visible
in panel d.

4.2. Modelling the PDFs with GMM

Let us now ﬁt the PDFs of the original and smoothed
EM/SH/T ﬂuxes, for the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring cases,
with Gaussians in order to reveal any regularity in the
peak distributions. Namely, in Figs. 2d-f, the Gaus-
sian ﬁts are performed by employing the GMM. At ﬁrst,
the number of ﬁtted Gaussian distributions were deter-
mined by the best Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values, which
supported our earlier ﬁndings that the periods are ag-
gregated in bands. The AIC/BIC analysis identiﬁed 5
components for the EM of ﬂaring ARs, and only 2 or
3 components for the SH and T. In order to make a
consistent comparison between all time series, and from
visual inspection of Figs. 2d-f, we impose a set number
of ﬁve GMM components for our analysis.

The central periodicities of the ﬁtted GMM are sum-
marized in Table 3. In each case, the fundamental fre-
quency belongs to the largest period. Based on this
fundamental frequency, we also calculated the expected
higher harmonics, which are shown in square brackets
in Table 3. In Fig. 2d the 1/n-dependence (n=1,2,3,...)
of the GMM-ﬁtted Gaussian peaks are, again, clearly

visible, which may serve to be evidence for the presence
of global eigenmodes.

Next, we investigate the relationship between the
Gaussian central periods obtained by GMM of the ﬂar-
ing and non-ﬂaring ARs. This relationship is visualised
in Fig. 3, where the x -axis shows the periods of ﬂar-
ing ARs while the y-axis is the periods of non-ﬂaring
ARs. The errors of the mean periods are estimated for
the obtained periods using a bootstrap method, using
a random re-sampling repeated 10,000 times. In Fig. 3,
the black dashed line represents the 100% correlation
between the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring cases.

From Fig. 3, we can see that the dependence of the
EM clearly becomes deviated from that of the SH and
T ﬂuxes. Also, the mean periods of EM of the non-
ﬂaring ARs are longer than the ﬂaring ones. These ﬁnd-
ings strongly suggest that the evolution of the EM ﬂux
component has a more prominent role in the ﬂare-CME
triggering processes when compared to that of the other
two helicity ﬂux components.

Previously, we determined the harmonics for each case
of the period peaks of the oscillatory behaviour of the
various helicity ﬂux components. From this, we can see

is, again, that the short periods split into two groups
after the ﬂare.

The T component behaves similarly to EM, in Fig. 4c.
The magnitudes of the periods shift towards lower val-
ues after the ﬂare onset, and, the higher periods mostly
disappear. Likewise to EM, the KS test result of p-value
= 0.370 shows that the diﬀerent period distributions be-
fore and after the ﬂare are not as pronounced as in the
SH case.

Next, Figs. 4d-f show the periodicities as a function
of time relative to the onset time of the largest ﬂare.
In general, we ﬁnd that shorter periods (2–8 hours), are
continuously present. However, the peak of longer pe-
riods (≥10 hrs) are more often observed before or just
a few hours after the ﬂares. Interestingly, the peaks of
the longer periods of EM/SH/T do not split up into fur-
ther bands after the ﬂares, as can be seen between the
dashed lines in Fig. 4d-f.

In summary, the shorter periods (<10 hrs) seem to
separate into two groups after the ﬂare (see Figs. 4a-c),
while the longer periods do not (see Figs. 4d-f).

4.4. Distribution of peaks of non-ﬂaring ARs

Next, the peak distributions of non-ﬂaring ARs are ex-
amined, separately for the EM, SH and T helicity ﬂuxes.
Since there is no set moment of ﬂare onset time in this
case, we select an arbitrary reference time in every non-
ﬂaring AR. Since the average investigated time interval
of an AR was about 7-9 days in duration, we deﬁne a set
of reference times ranging from 0 to 200 hrs, in 5-hour
increments (see the three corresponding animations for
EM, SH, and T in the online material). This range of
about a total of 40 diﬀerent reference times helps to
avoid bias in the analysis (Note: Please ﬁnd the anima-
tions in the Appendix.).

For each arbitrarily chosen time, the distributions of
EM/SH/T are analysed. The studied time intervals (be-
tween 50 and 140 hours) give an appropriate distribution
before and after the arbitrary time, because outside of
these time intervals, the peaks sometimes run very high
due to the normalization of the distribution. For this
reason, we ﬁlter the animations and cut oﬀ the begin-
ning and end of the arbitrarily chosen time intervals.

In summary, and most importantly, there is no signif-
icant change in the peak distribution before and after a
suitably chosen (say 40–50 to 130–145 hour) arbitrary
time when compared to the corresponding counter-parts
of analyses of ﬂaring ARs. Indeed, this is the expected
behaviour since there is no naturally distinguished phys-
ical reference time in non-ﬂaring ARs when the condi-
tions of helicity oscillations may undergo rapid changes,
as occurs in ﬂaring ARs. Overall, from the results found

Figure 3. Correlation between the Gaussian-central peri-
ods of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. The error bars are es-
timated with a bootstrapping method. The dashed black
line shows the one-to-one correspondence between ﬂaring and
non-ﬂaring periodicities. Only the EM periodicities are sig-
niﬁcantly above this line.

ics well for an oscillatory waveguide system. The 1/n
dependence (n=1,2,3,...) of the ﬁtted Gaussians of EM
of ﬂaring ARs is evidence of such an oscillatory system
(Fig. 2d). Such a clear harmonic property is not de-
tected in the diﬀerent ﬂux components of non-ﬂaring
ARs.

In summary, if the following series of events/features
occur, during the evolution of an AR, these may alert
us to an impending ﬂare/CME:

• once a δ-spot is forming,

• where shorter periods appear in the EM,

• where these periods show the properties of har-

monics of a resonant waveguide system.

4.3. Distribution of peaks of ﬂaring ARs

We now investigate the periodicity distributions of
peaks before and after the ﬂares.
In Fig. 4a, we plot
the distribution of the localised WPS peaks of EM be-
fore (red) and after (blue) the largest intensity ﬂares.
Based on the KS test with p = 0.305, the two distribu-
tions are diﬀerent: after the ﬂare, the main peak splits
into two distinct peaks (∼2.5 and ∼4.5 hours).

In the SH case, (Fig. 4b), the KS test with p = 0.199
indicates that the period distributions are diﬀerent be-
fore and after the ﬂare. The most striking feature here

Note—The mean values of the obtained (GMM) Gaussian distributions of the studied distri-
butions are listed. Square brackets are the fundamental periods with the associated harmonics
assuming the system is a uniform resonant waveguide.

so far, we may safely conclude that there is an intrin-
sic relationship between the periodic oscillations of the
helicity ﬂuxes and the ﬂaring activities of an AR.

4.5. Comparing the number of periods in ARs

In Figs. 4d–4f, the periods of WPS peaks of all ﬂar-
ing ARs are plotted, separately for the EM, SH, and T
ﬂuxes. The black vertical lines represent the reference
time of each ﬂare event. The center of the green rectan-
gles is determined by the center of the Gaussian distri-
butions ﬁtted by the GMM method (as seen in Table 3).
The height of the rectangles corresponds to the FWHM
value of the Gaussians, and the width of the rectangles
corresponds to 3 whole periods. This indicative width is
chosen because by multiplying the means of Gaussians
by e-fold, one would have about 3 oscillatory periods.

We count the number of peaks appearing within each
deﬁned rectangular region for the ﬂaring ARs, and for
an interval three periods earlier of the arbitrarily cho-
sen reference times for the non-ﬂaring ARs. In Fig. 5,
we plot the number of points summed from each green
rectangle as a function of the arbitrarily chosen refer-
ence times for the magnetic helicity ﬂux components of
ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. The x -axis of Fig. 5 corre-
sponds to the non-ﬂaring ARs reference times ranging
from 0 to 200 hrs, in 5-hour increments. A total of

40 diﬀerent reference times as in Section 4.4. For the
EM case (Fig. 5a), long (∼19-hour) periods are present
throughout, and are signiﬁcantly higher for the ﬂaring
ARs. For shorter periods, it is diﬃcult to distinguish
between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs.
In the SH case
(Fig. 5b), the maximum count is clearly identiﬁable at
∼14.1-hour. For the ﬂaring ARs, the long periods (∼20-
hour) appear for the total helicity ﬂux T (Fig. 5c), from
which we conclude that if these periods appear, we may
expect ﬂare/CME eruptions. No such clear diﬀerence
can be established from the shorter periods. At the
moment of ∼13.1 hour, the number of ﬂaring periods
is slightly higher than in the non-ﬂaring case, but this
alone is not suﬃcient to use it for ﬂare warning.

The presence of long periods in EM and T suggests

that it plays a crucial role in the formation of ﬂares.

5. SUMMARY

In this work, we tested and further developed the
results found in Kors´os et al. (2020), by carrying out
wavelet analysis, about the dynamic evolution of emer-
gence (EM), shearing (SH), and total (T) magnetic
helicity ﬂux terms. Kors´os et al. (2020) reported a
unique relationship between the oscillatory behavior of
the three magnetic helicity ﬂux components and the as-
sociated ﬂare activities.

Figure 4. Panels a-c: Distribution of EM/SH/T peaks before (red) and after (blue) the ﬂares. In the EM (a) case the most
striking feature is that the short periods split into ∼2.5 and ∼4.5 hours after the ﬂare occurred. Similar to the peaks of SH (b).
Panels d-f: EM/SH/T periods of all ﬂaring ARs. The black vertical line marks the reference time of the ﬂares. The center of the
green rectangles is given by the center of the Gaussian distributions ﬁtted by the GMM method. The height of the rectangles
corresponds to the FWHM value of the Gaussians ﬁtted by the GMM method. The width of the green rectangles corresponds
to 3 periods. The grey dashed lines are the boundaries of green rectangles, in case of the longer periods of EM/SH/T.

To test their conjecture, here, we have analyzed the
EM, SH, and T magnetic helicity ﬂux evolution of 14
ﬂaring and 14 non-ﬂaring ARs. Following the method-
ology of Kors´os et al. (2020), ﬁrst we mitigated the ar-
tiﬁcial 12- and 24-hr periods of the SDO/HMI magne-
togram measurements by set lower |±200| G and up-
per |±2000| G magnetic ﬁeld boundaries for an AR,
based on Smirnova et al. (2013) and Tziotziou et al.
(2015). To further reduce the 12- and 24-hr SDO ar-
tifacts, we smoothed the time series of EM/SH/T with
24-hr smoothing window and subtracted the obtained
averaging from the original data.

As a next step, we have constructed the wavelet power
spectrum (WPS) of EM/SH/T time series. Regions of
the WPS at above the 1σ signiﬁcance level were iden-
tiﬁed and the peaks contained in these regions were
recorded. Before ﬁnalising the |±200| G lower and
|±2000| G upper boundaries, we also extensively looked
into how these boundaries change the results when lim-
iting the magnetic ﬁeld strength. We found that, in gen-
eral, if one caps the magnetic ﬁeld strength, the lower
(3–15 hrs) periods become less frequent, like it was sug-
gested by Smirnova et al. (2013).

After determining the lower and upper magnetic ﬁeld
boundary values, the following results were found by
means of statistical analysis (see for more details Sec. 4)
of the identiﬁed local peaks within 1σ signiﬁcance level
of the corresponding WPS:

• For ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs, the EM/SH/T
periodicities occur in bands. These bands are be-
tween (i) 2–9 hours, (ii) 11–14 hours, and (iii) 19–
21 hours (see Figs. 2d-f).

• The distribution of EM/SH/T peak periodici-
ties were ﬁtted using a Gaussian Mixture Model.
Fig. 2d shows the 1/n-dependence (n = 1, 2, 3, ...,
a positive integer) of the GMM-ﬁtted EM peaks
for ﬂaring ARs. However, such clear harmonic os-
cillatory properties were not present in the SH/T
ﬂux components of ﬂaring and in the EM/SH/T
ﬂuxes of non-ﬂaring ARs.

• There is a noticeable diﬀerence in the distribution
of central periods found in the EM proﬁles be-
tween the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs, while no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found in the cases of the

Figure 5. Number of (a) EM, (b) SH and (c) T oscillatory peak periods in ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. The blue/red lines
correspond to non-ﬂaring/ﬂaring ARs. Long periods (∼20 hour) appear in the oscillatory peaks of the WPS of the T and EM
ﬂuxes of ﬂaring ARs, which seem to be linked to ﬂare/CME eruptions.

SH and T proﬁles. The central periodicities of the
non-ﬂaring EM are signiﬁcantly longer than the
ﬂaring.

• For the three helicity components, the distribution
of lower periods (<10 hrs) are concentrated around
∼2.5 hrs before the ﬂare events, see Fig. 4a-c. In-
terestingly, these lower periods are separated into
two groups (i.e. ∼2.5 and ∼4 hours), after the
ﬂares (see Fig. 4a-c). This could be explained
by the re-arrangement and disappearance of the
magnetic ﬁeld as a waveguide resonator “allow-
ing” oscillations around only ∼2.5 hour prior ﬂar-
ing. However, the distribution of the longer peri-
ods (>10 hrs) does not change after the ﬂares, see
the highlighted areas with dashed lines in Fig. 4d-
f.

• In the ﬂaring AR cases, the stronger presence of
long periods in the EM (i.e. ∼19 hour) and in T

(∼20 hour) oscillatory data would suggest that the
EM component does play a more crucial role in the
formation of ﬂares (see Fig. 5). This condition is
only indicative as these periods may also appear
in few cases of non-ﬂaring ARs (see the top panels
in columns a and c of Fig. 5).

• In the non-ﬂaring ARs studied, there is no sig-
niﬁcant change in the peak distributions before
and after a suitably chosen (say 40–50 to 130–145
hour) arbitrary reference time when compared to
the counterpart distributions before and after in
ﬂaring ARs (see Figs. 6, 7 and 8).

• To test the robustness of our ﬁndings, we look for a
bias in the selection of AR samples in two ways: i)
we exclude a random AR from the 14 ﬂaring AR
samples, as well as one from the 14 non-ﬂaring

So´os et al.

Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5 again. In both cases we came
to the same conclusion that neither the synthetic
samples nor the exclusion of 1-1 ARs change the
results signiﬁcantly.

Software: MUDPACK (Adams 1993), Wavelet Anal-
ysis (Torrence & Compo 1998), Persistent Homology
(Huber 2021), seaborn (Waskom 2021), sklearn (Pe-
dregosa et al. 2011), scipy (Virtanen et al. 2020)

Based on the above, we conclude that there is an in-
trinsic relationship between the periodic oscillations of
the helicity ﬂuxes and ﬂare activity. Our results show
that the evolution of the EM helicity ﬂux component
has a more prominent role in the ﬂare-CME triggering
process, especially when

• the AR has a δ-spot,

• the shorter oscillatory periods appear in the EM

ﬂux data, and

• these periods show the presence of a harmonic os-

cillatory resonator.

To apply these results as a precursor, or, use them to
distinguishing between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs, we
need at least ∼2.5 days data to study the evolution of the
three helicity ﬂux components and reveal the possible
characteristic long period(s) of a ﬂaring AR by wavelet
analyses.

APPENDIX

Here, we list the associated animations of the distribution of peaks of non-ﬂaring ARs, available in the online version.
The animations show the distribution of periods before the arbitrarily chosen reference moment of time (in blue) and
the distribution of periods after the arbitrarily chosen reference time (in red).
