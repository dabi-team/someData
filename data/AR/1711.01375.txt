Abstract 

We  propose  an  approach  to  control  the  polarization  of  terahertz  (THz)  radiation  from  intrinsic  Josephson-
junction  stacks  in  single  crystalline  high-temperature  superconductor  Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8.  Monolithic  control  of  the 
surface high-frequency current distributions in the truncated square mesa structure allows us to modulate the 
polarization of the emitted THz wave as a result of two orthogonal fundamental modes excited inside the mesa. 
Highly polarized circular terahertz waves with a degree of circular polarization of more than 99% can be generated 
using an electrically controlled method. The intuitive results obtained from the numerical simulation based on the 
conventional antenna theory are consistent with the observed emission characteristics.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The terahertz frequency range (0.3–10 THz) has attracted a considerable amount of interest in recent years. This 
is largely because of the numerous vibrational and rotational molecular absorption lines it contains which are used 
as marking regions in spectroscopy applications [1]. Ever since the demonstration of an intense THz radiation from 
a stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) made from Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ (Bi-2212) [2], there has been an increased 
interest  in  the  development  of  IJJ-based  devices  as  highly  promising  emitters  of  coherent  continuous-wave 
terahertz  radiations [3–5].  Imaging,  sensing,  and  spectroscopy  applications  require  some  control  over  the 
properties of radiations emitted from THz sources. The polarization of terahertz radiations is of special importance 
in vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy (VCD) [6,7], high-speed telecommunications, and THz continuous–
wave polarization imaging [8]. In laboratory setups, circular polarization (CP) can be realized through use of optical 
devices, such as quarter-wave plates; however, the use of compact monolithic sources has proven to be less costly 
and more suitable for applications that require portability. Circularly polarized THz emissions have recently been 
experimentally  achieved  by  utilizing  monolithic  devices,  such  as  quantum  cascade  lasers [9,10]  and  resonant-
tunneling diodes [11]. Compared to these devices, IJJ-based sources can cover wider frequency ranges, which are 
unattainable  by  other  THz  sources [4].  Furthermore,  the  emission  intensity  of  IJJ-based  devices  can  also  be 
thermally controlled, both internally [12,13] and externally [14,15]. By applying a direct current (DC) voltage (𝑉𝑏) 
across the c-axis of IJJs stacked in a mesa form, a high frequency (HF) current is generated along with emission of 
sub-terahertz  radiation  at  the  Josephson  frequency  given  by 𝑓𝐽 = (2𝑒𝑉𝑏/ℎ𝑁),  where ℎ, 𝑒,  and 𝑁 denote  the 
Planck  constant,  elementary  charge,  and  number  of  contributing  IJJs,  respectively.  Emission  of  high-intensity 
radiation  is  observed  when  the  oscillating  IJJs  resonate  in  the  excited  cavity  mode [2,3].  Extant  studies  have 
investigated the excited cavity  modes  in Bi-2212 mesa  structures  by observing the  distribution of the  far-field 
intensity as a function of the azimuth angle [16,17]. Additionally, the patch antenna model [18,19] has been found 
useful in describing the coupling between space and Josephson plasma waves inside the mesa structure [20–24]. 
A  more  direct  approach  to  determine  the  excited  cavity  mode  is  to  measure  the  polarization  of  the  emitted 
radiation  as  a  function  of  the  mesa  shape  and  bias  conditions.  These  factors  have,  thus  far,  remained 
uninvestigated. 

Waves  emitted  from  rectangular  IJJ-based  sources  have  been  known  to  be  linearly  polarized [2].  However, 
recent numerical studies [14,25,26] have proposed the possibility of realizing circularly polarized emissions from 
IJJ devices. This paper reports the first experimental demonstration of the generation of circularly polarized sub-
THz waves from a monolithic source—a superconducting IJJ stack—wherein the ellipticity and evolution direction 
are tuned by mesa shape and bias conditions. The highest degree of circular polarization (DOCP) recorded in the 
study proposed herein is 99.7%, which is higher than that recorded by state-of-the-art quantum cascade lasers 
used for obtaining circular polarization [9,10,27]. As circularly polarized THz waves could be employed in a wide 
variety of potential applications, the result obtained in this study, along with recently reported packaging [28] and 
demonstration of THz torch [29], it is believed, will significantly influence and inspire the development of practical 
applications of IJJ-based THz emission devices [4,30]. 

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 

A. Samples design & fabrication 

The mesa-shaped design is based on the truncated-edge square microstrip patch antenna [18,31–33]. Figures 
1(a) and 1(b), respectively, depict a schematic of the IJJ-based device developed in this study and a microscopic 
image of sample #2. The mesa structure was fabricated from a Bi-2212 single crystal using photolithography and 
Ar-ion  milling [13].  Circular  polarization  in  the  proposed  design  was  realized  through  the  excitation  of  two 
transverse orthogonal modes along the major and minor diagonals, as depicted in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). On account 
of the small area of the truncated edge, the two above-mentioned transverse modes exhibit adjacent resonant 

2 

 
 
frequencies.  The  mesa  shape  was  designed  with  a  perturbation  to  mix  the  two  modes  at  the  cavity  resonant 
frequency (i.e., the arithmetic mean of the two adjacent resonant frequencies) with a phase difference of 𝜋/2 
radians between them thereby forming a rotating surface current (refer to the animation in the supplementary 
data). According to the antenna theory, electric fields corresponding to the two above-mentioned eigen modes 
represented  by  𝐸1 = (√𝑆 𝑤⁄ )(sin 𝑘𝑥 − sin 𝑘𝑦) 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝐸2 = (√𝑆 𝑤⁄ )(sin 𝑘𝑥 +
could  be  mathematically 
sin 𝑘𝑦)  [31,32],  where  𝑤  is  the  total  length  of  the  square  side  and  𝑘 = π/𝑤 .    The  most  significant  design 
parameters that control the polarization state of the emitted radiation comprise the untruncated surface area 𝑆, 
the  trimmed  surface  area Δ𝑠 (perturbation),  and  the  feeding  electrode  position,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  1(d).  The 
resonant  frequencies  of  these  two  modes  are  given  by  𝑓1 = 𝑓0𝑟  and  𝑓2 = 𝑓0𝑟(1 + 2Δ𝑠 𝑆⁄ )  with  𝑓0𝑟 =
𝑐0 2𝑛𝑤⁄
  [18,32,34],  where  c0  is  the  speed  of  light  in  vacuum  and  n  is  the  refractive  index.  The  electric  field 
distribution of the mixed mode can be represented by the linear combination of the two above-mentioned modes, 
as given below.  

𝐸𝑧 = 𝐸1. 𝑒𝑖2𝜋𝑓1𝑡 + 𝐸2. 𝑒𝑖(2𝜋𝑓2𝑡+𝛿) , 

 (1) 

where δ is the phase difference between the two modes. The above equation demonstrates that the first mode 
is antisymmetric with respect to the minor diagonal axis, and the second mode is antisymmetric with respect to 
the  major  diagonal  axis,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  1(d).  Therefore,  the  critical  current  density  distribution  jc  must  be 
antisymmetric with respect to both axes for the two modes to be excited at the same time. This implies that the 
feeding point must be on either the x- or y-axis for circular polarization to be achieved [35].  

As  oscillations  in  the  proposed  device  are  generated  locally  by  Josephson  junctions,  the  local  rise  in  mesa 
temperature  due  to  DC  current  injection  acts  as  a  perturbation  to  address  the  degeneracy  of  the  two  CP 
modes [36]. Antenna theory predicts that the position of an electrode, feeding HF from the source, with respect 
to the truncated edges determines the direction of rotation of the emissions [left-hand CP (LHCP) or right-hand 
CP  (RHCP)]   [18,37];  This  implies  that  when  the  truncated  edge  is  on  the  left  side  of  the  feeding  point,  RHCP 
emission is obtained and vice versa. Nonetheless, as mentioned earlier, the high-frequency feeding in the device 
under study is generated inside the mesa structure on account of DC current injection. This might altogether result 
in a rotational direction that may be different from the ones described above; this has been discussed later in this 
paper.  

B. Electromagnetic simulation 

The  initial  design  parameters  were  determined  using  the  commercial  full-wave  three-dimensional  finite-
element electromagnetic simulation software—Ansys HFSS [26]. Similar simplified methods have previously been 
used to determine cavity resonance conditions [26,38], and a more advanced method, capable of solving sine–
Gordon equations, was used to determine polarization properties [25]. A model similar to that reported in [26] 
was used, wherein the dielectric constant  𝜖 = 17.6, and the feeding point is placed over the horizontal axis of the 
geometry.  To  account  for  the  losses  incurred owing to  the  skin  effect,  an  impedance  boundary  condition  was 
applied to the model [39], and the complex surface impedance was estimated by using, both, the Zimmermann 
2𝜎′𝜔2𝜆3 ,  where  𝜎′ =
𝜇0
 , 𝛿𝑠 is the skin depth, 𝜔 is the angular frequency, 𝜇 is the magnetic permeability, and 𝜆 = 210 nm is the 

method [26,39,40]  and  the  a–b  surface  resistance  correction [41]  given  by  𝑅𝑠 =

⁄
2 𝜔𝜇𝛿𝑠
penetration depth.

Figure 2(b) depicts a comparison of the axial ratios (ARs) determined through simulation of the proposed model 
and experimental results obtained from sample #3. The proposed model had parametric dimensions comparable 
to those of sample #3. Dimensions of the proposed model are a1 = 13 µm and a2 = 69 µm, where a1 and a2 represent 
the side length of the isosceles right-angled triangle-shaped truncated corner of the square microstrip and length 
of the remainder of the truncated square side, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(d). The scattering parameter (S11),

as determined from the electromagnetic simulation, is shown on the right axis as a green line and demonstrates 
sharp minima at the two resonant frequencies 𝑓1 and 𝑓2. 

C. Measurement setup and polarization characterization 

Samples were mounted on a Cu cold finger placed inside a He-flow cryostat with a transparent optical window, 
as depicted in Fig. 2(a). The radiation characteristics were detected by using a Si-bolometer and lock-in amplifier. 
The polarization was then measured by rotating a wire-grid polarizer in the beam path and recording the angle-
dependent  intensity.  To  characterize  the  polarization  of  the  emissions,  the  polarization  ellipse [10,42]  was 
obtained  by  using  the  detected  intensity  as  a  function  of  the  polarizer  angle.  The  polarization  state  is  best 
represented by the axial ratio for the entire emission range. The axial ratio, in dB, is defined as the ratio of the 
lengths of the major and minor axes (maximum and minimum intensities) of the polarization ellipse fitted to the 
polar plot of the detected intensity as a function of the polarizer angle; i.e., AR = 20 [log (𝐼max 𝐼min
)]. It is to be 
noted that polarization with an AR of less than 3 dB can be regarded as CP [37]. Frequency measurements were 
performed  using  a  high-resolution  lab-built  Martin–Puplett  FTIR  interferometer [43],  wherein  the  estimated 
emission frequency was obtained through linear interpolation of the measured data.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

To discuss the effect of design parameters on the polarization state, we present the emission features of three 
samples with different a2/a1 values. The values of a1 and a2 and the thickness t of the mesa structure for the three 
samples are summarized in Table 1. I–V characteristics (IVC) and device emissions (pre-characterization) were first 
confirmed followed by polarization measurement through use of the above-mentioned setup [Fig. 2(a)].   

Sample #1, along with all other samples, exhibits typical characteristics of slightly under-doped Bi-2212 mesas. 
IVC of sample #1 is depicted in Fig. 3(a) along with its detection intensity measured at the outermost IVC branch. 
In this study, all polarization measurements as well as IVC determination were performed at the bath temperature 
corresponding to the highest emission intensity (Tb = 21 K).  At about 13.4 mA, a sharp voltage dip is observed 
from  1.63  to  1.40  V,  which  could  arguably  be  attributed  to  the  formation  of  hotspots [12,44–47].  Emission  is 
observed at a bias voltage 𝑉𝑏 = 1.6 V and current 𝐼𝑏 = 10.4 mA with two peaks—9.8 mA at 1.69 V and 8 mA at 
1.89  V—as  indicated  by  red  arrows  in  Fig.  3(a).  These  peaks,  at  frequencies  of  544.3  and  608.6  GHz,  may 
correspond to the excitation of the two cavity modes [25].  The detected power (P), estimated in accordance with 
bolometer sensitivity, is found to be of the order of Pmax ≈ 176.5 nW.  

In the present study, the highest value of CP with AR = 0.2 was obtained under 𝐼𝑏 =  8 mA and 𝑉𝑏 = 1.9 V, as 
depicted in Fig. 3(b). At the point, DOCP was calculated to be 99.7%. This is the highest DOCP value recorded till 
date while using a monolithic THz source [10,9]. The AR increases accompanying considerable fluctuations as the 
emission diverge from the optimum bias point. Circularly polarized emission with AR < 3 dB is also observed in 
sample #2 as seen Fig. 3(c). The lowest AR recorded while using sample #3 was 4.5, which represents an elliptical 
polarization. Details of the obtained results are summarized in Table 1.

The detection of the circularly and elliptically polarized waves is a clear indication of emission attributed to the 
flow of an in-plane superconducting current on the mesa surface. In a biased Josephson junction, an HF current 
flows  across  the  barrier  at  a  frequency  determined  by  the  AC  Josephson  relation.  A  standing  wave  of  half  a 
wavelength is consequently formed with antinodes located at both edges of a Josephson junction. Owing to the 
synchronization among the excited Josephson junctions in the stack, a net surface current oscillates according to 
the AC Josephson effect. This current gives rise to an oscillating magnetic field, which couples to surrounding space. 
In  rectangular  IJJ  mesa  devices,  whose  emissions  have  been  intensively  investigated  by  different  groups,  the 
synchronized transverse Josephson plasma wave that causes linearly polarized far-field detection is usually a two-
dimensional  (2D)  standing  wave  polarized  in  the  direction  of  z-axis  and  propagating  along  the  x-axis [2,48].  In 
circularly polarized radiation, the propagation direction of the synchronized transverse Josephson plasma wave 
rotates at a frequency determined by the AC Josephson relation and resonance frequency relations of the two 
modes, as shown in Fig. 1(c), where 𝑓1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑓2 in Eq. (1) correspond to Josephson oscillation frequencies. 

By  directly  using  the  relation  between  the  measured  polarization-dependent  intensity  and  the  polarization 
ellipse [10,42],  the  polarization  characteristics  of  sample  #1  were  determined.  Figure  3(d)  captures  the 
polarization-dependent  intensity  at  the  minimum  AR  point  in  the  polar  plot.  The  detected  intensity  does  not 
depend on ϴ, although slight deformations in the two-fold symmetry may be detected. For samples #2 and #3, 
minimum  AR  values  obtained  in  the  same  manner  are  0.5  and  4.5,  respectively.  The  variation  in  the  value  of 
minimum AR with respect to sample geometry is discussed in subsequent paragraphs.  

As observed in Fig. 3(b), AR exhibits no significant dependence on bias-current and maintains a value less than 
1 dB, with a fluctuation of about 0.5 dB, around the minimum AR condition (6.5–10.5 mA). At higher values of Ib 
(> 10.5 mA), the value of AR is seen to rapidly increase. This is a common feature of samples #2 and #3. It may be 

5 

 
 
 
 
concluded that when AR > 2 dB, its value is seen to rapidly increases with the deviation of 𝐼𝑏from the optimum 
bias point. For sample #2, the Josephson frequency estimated by 𝑉𝑏 is plotted in Fig. 3 (c) along with the current 
evolution of AR. Any change in  𝑉𝑏 results in a corresponding change in the frequency of emission. This effect is 
believed  to  be  caused  by  the  detection  of  no  signs  of  variation  in  the  value  of  N,  which  usually  appears  as  a 
discontinuity in measured 𝑉𝑏, during the experiments performed in this study.  It was, therefore, considered that 
the estimated emission frequency varied within the range 0.46—0.50 THz with AR < 3 dB. Results obtained through 
numerical simulations indicate a steep dip in the minimum value of AR, as depicted in Fig. 4(b) [26]; on the other 
hand, however, experimental results indicate that AR does not demonstrate a strong dependence on frequency. 
This  discrepancy  in  the  results  is  believed  to  be  caused  by  the  trapezoidal  shape  of  the  mesa.  The  estimated 
geometrical resonant frequency exhibited by the geometry at the top of the stack was found to be 13% higher 
than  that  exhibited  by  the  geometry  at  the  bottom.  This  is  supposed  to  be  caused  by  an  entrainment  effect, 
wherein synchronization occurs between thousands of stacked IJJs at frequencies determined by the geometry of 
a part of the stack. Accordingly, the frequency range over which circular polarization is achieved is found to expand 
remarkably, and a sharp increase in  AR  is observed;  this is in addition to  the synchronization  frequency  range 
obtained through experiments. 

In accordance with the antenna theory, the minimum value of AR (ARmin) in a truncated edge patch antenna can 
be achieved when 𝑎2 𝑎1⁄ = √2𝑄0 − 1 [31,32]. Hence, the two main factors that contribute to the attainment of 
CP  are  the  ratio 𝑎2/𝑎1 and  the  quality  factor  (𝑄0).  Results of  the electromagnetic  simulation  indicate  that  the 
existence of an optimum value of 𝑎2/𝑎1 that corresponds to the lowest value of ARmin. Figure 4(a) depicts the 
variation in ARmin, including the values calculated in accordance with the preconditions mentioned in section II (B) 
as  well  as  those  obtained  experimentally  in  this  study,  as  a  function  of 𝑎2 𝑎1⁄ .  The  disagreement  between 
optimum values  of  the  ratio 𝑎2/𝑎1  determined  through  simulation  and  experimental  measurements  may  be 
attributed to the use of a simplified model. The value of 𝑄0, estimated from experimental results is 13 and that 
calculated through simulations is 36. The former value includes the ambiguity of dimensions on account of the 
trapezoidal shape of the mesa in addition to intrinsic material parameters, such as refractive index and surface 
impedance, which strongly influence the calculated value of 𝑄0.  

Figure 5 depicts the emission spectra obtained for sample #3. Experimentally obtained AR as a function of the 
measured emission frequency, along with numerically calculated AR is plotted in Fig. 2 (b). The observed deviation 
from  model  calculation  is  believed  to  have  been  by  reasons  similar  to  the  ones  mentioned  in  the  preceding 
paragraph. The measured frequency range (0.435–0.457 THz) closely agrees with the estimated modal frequency 
for geometries occupying the top of the mesa stack [49]. Also, similar to the case illustrated above, 𝑉𝑏 was found 
to be considerably higher than  its  value  predicted using  the emission frequency.  This is believed to be  due  to 
excess  voltage  along  the  ab-plane  accompanied  by  nucleation  of  hotspots [50].  as  depicted  in  Fig.  S1  in  the 
supplementary material.  Accordingly, the  measurement  of electric potential at  the  edges may  result in higher 
values of the estimated Josephson frequency. Asymmetric electrode positions and emissions corresponding to the 
back-bending  region of the  IVC may  also yield  similar results  as  frequency estimation  is also affected by Joule 
heating [49].  Frequency  measurements  performed  for  sample  #3  and  previously  published  experimental 
results [38] indicate that electromagnetic simulations can be used to identify cavity resonant frequencies. Figures 
4(b)  depicts  the  variation of  the  scattering  parameter  (S11)  (blue  line)  and  AR  (red  line)  with the  frequency of 
emission for sample #1. On the basis of these results, the resonant frequencies for sample #1 are estimated as 
𝑓1   = 402 GHz and 𝑓2   = 434 GHz.  

Recently, Asai and Kawabata predicted the emission of circularly polarized radiation from a slightly rectangular 
IJJ mesa, wherein the rise in local temperature was achieved through laser irradiation [25,36]. Their studies claim 
that  LHCP  is  achieved when  a  corner,  located  on  the  left  of the major  bisector  and  facing  the center  (“A”),  is 
irradiated by laser radiation. By the same reasoning, RHCP would be achieved when the adjacent corner (either 

6 

 
 
“D” or “G”) is heated. These results suggest that the in-plane superconducting current of the mesa surface, which 
causes a propagating electric field in the space, rotates in the direction defined by an arbitrary vector that starts 
from  the  point  of  irradiation  and  ends  at  the  major  bisector  of  the  rectangular  mesa  (counter-clockwise  and 
clockwise current rotations observed at points A and D, respectively). In the experiments conducted in this study, 
the current electrode provides heat to the mesa and ends up performing a function similar to that performed by 
laser irradiation in the above study. In the proposed study, sample #1 exhibits a similar trend in terms of shape 
and heating as the model used in the above-mentioned study. This similarity could be attributed to the fact that 
the heating portion is located on the right of the major (untruncated) diagonal of the mesa (facing the center of 
the  mesa).  Therefore,  in  sample  #1  (truncated  left  edge),  we  consider  that  the  in-plane  current  rotates 
counterclockwise;  therefore,  LHCP  radiation  is  obtained  under  a  bias  of  7–10  mA.  For  the  same  reasons,  the 
electric field generated using sample #2 [Fig. 1(b)] is left-handed and that generated using sample #3 (truncated 
right edge) is right-handed. Thus, the direction of polarization rotation predicted for truncated-edge square mesa 
is opposite to that estimated by antenna theory for similarly shaped antenna fed at the same position. 

In order to better understand the progression of polarization over the entire bias current range, plots in Figs. 
6(a and b) depict the observed current-dependent intensity distribution in the form of a false-colored 2D contour 
plot for samples #1 and #3, respectively. As can be realized in Fig. 6(a), the maximum emission intensity is achieved 
in the minimum AR (best CP) at current range of 8.3–8.5 mA; however, a rather low intensity is observed at the 
other low AR point (7 mA). In sample #1, the maxima of intensity correspond to the minimum values of AR (< 1 
dB).  It  was  also  observed  that  the  angle  of  the  major  axis,  indicated  by  an  asterisk,  is  independent  of  𝐼𝑏 . 
Considering that the observed emission is a superposition of the two circular polarized modes (RHCP and LHCP), 
the AR evolution could be attributed to the variation in amplitudes of the two circularly polarized modes with a 
constant phase difference between them. Some minor fluctuations in the measured angle of the major axis angle 
were noticed in sample #1, which correspond to a small change in magnitude of the transverse mode owing to 
the imperfect shape of the edges.  This fluctuation was less noticeable in sample #3 [Fig. 6(b)]. The author intends 
to investigate this issue in detail in a future endeavor. 

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

This  paper  presents  the  design,  fabrication,  and  experimental  demonstration  of  a  technique  to  generate 
circularly polarized terahertz radiations that comprise low axial ratios and maintain a high output intensity through 
use of an intrinsic Josephson junction oscillator. Circular polarization is achieved by using a simple truncated-edge 
square  mesa  structure.  It  verifies  the  simplicity  and  applicability  of  the  antenna  theory  alongside  existing 
electromagnetic simulation methods in achieving the desirable polarization. Furthermore, because the proposed 
method is based on the excitation of IJJs within a mesa cavity, it avoids issues with the insertion loss associated 
with  external  polarimetric  modulators,  which  may  be  substantial  in  the  terahertz  frequency  range.  The 
polarization  characteristics  have  been  discussed  at  length  in  terms  of  both  the  antenna  theory  as  well  as 
electromagnetic simulations. These results pave the way for the development of enhanced circularly polarized 
sources  of  terahertz  radiation  for  use  in  practical  applications,  such  as  mobile  communications  and  circular 
dichroism spectroscopy.
