A detailed numerical study on the phenomenon of Shock Wave focusing in air is carried out. The
focusing phenomenon is achieved with the help of a shock tube and a converging section attached
to it. The planar shock generated inside the shock tube is converted to spherical shock with the
help of the converging section and is focused to a point. High-temperature eﬀects like temperature-
dependent Cp variation and chemical reactions corresponding to dissociated air are included in the
simulation. The chemical reactions including the dissociation, recombination and ionization of nine
species of air including three ions (N2, O2, N, O, NO, Ar, N O+, O+ and Ar+) are monitored
throughout the simulation. The eﬀect of driven section ﬁlling conditions such as initial pressure and
temperature on focusing parameters is studied. The variation in the initial ﬁll temperature is found
to aﬀect the ﬂow properties much more as compared to the change in initial ﬁll pressure, while
maintaining the same shock strength. The eﬀect of incident shock strength on shock wave focusing
is also investigated. It is observed that as the strength of the shock increases, the conditions like
temperature and pressure at the focusing point increases and thereby increasing the reaction rate
of all the reactions.

INTRODUCTION

Shock Waves (SW) are disturbances that travels faster
than the local acoustic speed in a medium and usually
formed as an outcome of impulsive energy discharge. SW
has the ability to rapidly dissipate the inherent energy,
thereby causing drastic change in ﬂuid properties. This
property of SW has enabled researchers to explore and in-
vestigate the possibility of SW focusing; a method where
SW is conﬁned or focused to a small region in space. The
phenomenon of focusing a SW to a point/region leads to
very high energy concentration and typically ﬁnds appli-
cation in the ﬁeld of medicine (SW lithotripsy), mate-
rial science [1] and nuclear technology [2]. Most of the
times, the temperature in the focused region is so high
that the enclosed gas starts radiating [3] which can be
depicted during supernova collapse [4] and gas bubble
sonoluminescence [5]. Applications of SW focusing phe-
nomenon in the aerospace industry is enormous. Shock
focusing ignition techniques enable in increasing the eﬃ-
ciency of a pulse detonation engine [6]. Flow conditions
that exhibit within in the shock layer of the spacecraft as
it encounters various planetary entry/re-entry conditions
can also be simulated through shock focusing. Detailed
investigation to generate this radiating equilibrium and
non-equilibrium ﬂowﬁeld using ground based facilities is
scarce. In past, few methods were employed to focus a
SW [7], which includes shock tube exploration, exploding
wire technique, usage of micro explosives etc.

Several researchers have attempted to attain SW fo-
cusing through analytical, numerical and experimental

∗ ibrahim@iitk.ac.in

approaches out of which Guderly (1942) [8] was the ﬁrst
to investigate the convergence of SW analytically. A self-
similar analytical solution was proposed for the radius of
converging SW as a function of time. Simultaneously, ex-
perimental methods for achieving SW focusing was devel-
oped which encompasses tear-drop insert inside a shock
tube [9], hemispherical implosion chamber [10], parabolic
reﬂector inside shock tube [11], annular shock tube [3]
etc. Most of the SW focusing achieved through shock
tube was performed for a rectangular cross-sectional ge-
ometry which thereby resulted in 2-dimensional cylindri-
cal SW. The exception being the facility at the KTH
Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, where focusing
of a spherical SW was achieved with the help of a shock
tube having circular cross-section [12][13][14]. It was also
reported that in the case of spherical SW focusing, the
energy concentration in the core region is higher as com-
pared to cylindrical way of focusing the shock wave [15].

During the spherical SW focusing, a smooth curvature
transformation section is attached to the driven section
end, upon entering which the planar SW gets smoothly
transformed to spherical shape with minimal diﬀraction.
After this SW implosion, very high temperature region
( 27000 K in Argon test gas) was observed at the instance
of focusing [16]. Also, a review of literature shows that
spherical SW focusing and characterizing the ﬂow ﬁeld
properties with air as test gas is minimal.

With this backdrop, the current work focuses towards
simulating spherical SW focusing in air medium through
numerical approach to have a better understanding of
the ﬂow ﬁeld and its properties. The computational do-
main for this study involves a shock tube along with an
attached converging section which enables in generating
spherical shock with minimum diﬀusion. With shock

 
 
 
 
 
 
wave focusing to a point, rapid ampliﬁcation of energy
concentration could trigger dissociation, ionization and
recombination of constitutive molecules as well as ions.
The major components of atmospheric air being oxygen,
nitrogen, and argon, the variation in concentration of
these species along with ions are monitored during SW
focusing. Moreover, the inﬂuence of the change in ini-
tial ﬁll conditions, such as ﬁll temperature and ﬁll pres-
sure, as well as the initial shock strength on the focus-
ing phenomenon are also carried out. Quantitative and
qualitative assessment of alternation in ﬂow parameters
at the focused region and temporal variation of diﬀerent
species concentration are performed for estimating the
key parameter which aﬀects the focusing phenomenon to
a larger extent.

II. NUMERICAL MODELING AND APPROACH

The current numerical simulations are carried out with
commercially available CFD software ANSYS Fluent V-
18.2. An initial assessment of the ﬂow was obtained by
performing perfect gas simulations. Later, in view of the
probable dissociation of air molecules, high-temperature
eﬀects along with reaction models are incorporated into
the simulations.

A. Geometry Details

The geometry for the present simulation includes a
shock tube having smoothly converging test section at
the end in order to achieve SW focusing, and the dimen-
sions are based on the shock tube test facility present
in the Hypersonic Experimental Aerodynamic Labora-
tory (HEAL), Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT
Kanpur. The facility with 85mm internal diameter has
a 1 m driver tube and 7 m long driven section with a
296 mm converging portion attached to its end. The exit
diameter of the convergent section is measured to be 0.6
mm. Moreover, in order to have comparative assessment
with experimental solution, 26 mm from the end of the
converging part is designed as a conical section having
21◦ semi apex angle. The proﬁle for the contoured con-
verging test section is generated as per the geometric re-
lations proposed by Malte [12], with an intention to have
minimum diﬀusion of the moving shock.

verging section attached to the shock tube end. The 26 mm
long conical section is shown as an insert

FIG. 2. Mesh and boundary condition of the computational
domain

Furthermore, it is computationally expensive to simu-
late the entire shock tube with attached converging sec-
tion. Therefore, keeping in view of the region of interest,
i.e. near focusing region, the computational domain is re-
stricted till 200mm of the constant area section as shown
in Figure 1. This length is ﬁnalized in conjunction with
the x-t diagram [17] for the corresponding test cases with
an intention to avoid any ﬂow interaction inside the test
domain during the test duration.

Further reduction in the computational complexity
and cost is achieved by considering half of the domain
due to the axis-symmetric nature of the problem. The
ﬁnal computational domain as shown in Figure 1 is di-
vided into two segments for initialization purpose where
the region 1 is assigned with driven gas ﬁlling param-
eters. However, to replicate a planar moving shock of
strength of Ms inside the domain, Rankine- Hugoniot re-
lation is used to obtain the corresponding ﬂow properties
associated with the incident shock Ms and are given as
the initial condition for region 2.

The boundary conditions associated with the domain
is shown in Figure 2 where the base of the domain is
provided with axis boundary condition to imitate the
axis-symmetric simulations. The extreme left edge of the
domain is considered as pressure far-ﬁeld with properties
same as assigned to zone-2. This ensures a continuous in-
ﬂux of the shock-induced test gas into the domain. The
top and right boundary is assigned with no-slip wall con-
dition.

B. Numerical approach

The simulations are carried out using commercially
available software ANSYS Fluent which incorporates ﬁ-
nite volume approach to solve the governing equations.
A density-based, transient-implicit solver is used to solve
continuity, momentum and energy equation. AUSM
ﬂux scheme and second-order spatial discretization are
adopted as solution methods to improve solution accu-
racy. Air with initial concentration of 76% Nitrogen, 23%
Oxygen, 1% Argon is considered as test gas for most of
the simulations. Initially, inviscid perfect gas simulations
are carried out to have information on the qualitative as-
pect of the ﬂow structures evolved during focusing along
with magnitudes of diﬀerent ﬂow parameters. These sim-
ulations are also extended to ensure necessary validation
with experimental test cases. It is observed that at the
instance of focusing, the temperature magnitude shoots

up rapidly to very high values ranging from 4000 K to
6000 K which can trigger reaction between constitutive
elements of air molecule. To precisely model these re-
actions, simulations with included high temperature ef-
fects which encompass temperature-dependent Cp varia-
tion and inclusion of chemical reactions are carried out.
Cp is assumed to be piecewise polynomial function
of temperature [18] and mixing law formulation is used
for calculating the eﬀective Cp of the test gas. Sim-
ilarly, reaction models including 11 dissociation and
recombination reactions [19] along with 3 ionization
reactions[20][21] are taken into account for estimating
variation in species concentration of Nitrogen (N2), Oxy-
gen (O2), Nitric Oxide (NO), Atomic Nitrogen (N),
Atomic Oxygen (O) and Argon (Ar) as well as ions like
N O+, O+ and Ar+. Details of the reactions used in
the current simulation are listed in Table I. To estimate
these species concentrations, species transport equation
is solved where ﬁnite rate model is opted for computing
the rate of creation or destruction of a species. Neverthe-
less, for a speciﬁc reaction, the forward reaction rate is ef-
fectively estimated through the use of Arrhenius equation
(Equation 1) with constant parameters obtained from
previous studies [19].

Kf = AT (β)e(E/RT )

Where, Kf : Forward rate constant, A: Pre-exponential
factor, β: Temperature exponent, E: Activation energy

Table II lists the initial conditions with the ﬂow that is
being considered for the current simulations. The prime
intent behind the variations in initial conditions is at-
tributed to estimate the eﬀect of diﬀerent ﬁlling condi-
tion towards shock focusing phenomenon in terms of as-
sessing the magnitude of diﬀerent ﬂow parameters and
species concentration. Case-1 is taken as a base case

study, where the incident shock strength Ms is ﬁxed to be
1.5, and the driven gas conditions are set as atmospheric.
The nomenclature for case-1 is designated as ‘M1.5’. To
obtain the eﬀect of driven gas ﬁlling pressure on the shock
focusing phenomenon, Case-2 is generated where the ini-
tial pressure in the region 1 (P1) is increased by 30%
keeping the incident shock strength constant (M1.5-P30).
Similarly, the eﬀect of initial ﬁlling temperature is esti-
mated through Case-3 in which only the driven gas viz.
zone-1 temperature (T1) is increased by 30% (M1.5-T30).
Furthermore, the induced eﬀect of increase in the shock
strength on focusing phenomenon is obtained by varying
the incident shock Mach number Ms to 2.05 as presented
in Case-4.

During the simulation for aforementioned test cases,
the temporal variation of static temperature, pressure
and mass fraction of diﬀerent species is monitored at the
focusing point. Besides, the static pressure at several
points along the axis of the domain is also monitored
which enabled to obtain the change in shock Mach num-
ber as the planar shock enters into the converging section.
Prior to actual simulations, considering the transient
nature of the shock tube problem, it is hereby planned to
carry out grid as well as time step independence study. In
line with this, inviscid perfect gas simulation is performed
with initial conditions corresponding to Case-4 where the
incident shock strength is 2.05.

Meshing for the present computation, which can be
seen in Figure
2, was carried out by quadrilateral
mapped facing method with bias factor given to the zone
of interest viz. converging section. Grid independency
test was carried out in two steps. Primarily, meshing
parameters are changed in the constant area section as
well as in the initial part of the converging section to en-
sure that the ﬂow properties are not changing. Further,
the grid concentration inside the conical section (refer
Figure 1) being the decisive parameter in determining
the focusing phenomenon more accurately, it is thereby
varied and illustrated in Figure 3. The variation of the
peak temperature obtained at the focusing point for dif-
ferent grid sizes inside the conical section shows minute
change for 15960 and 16660 elements. Therefore, for fu-
ture simulations total number of elements is considered
to be 15960.

point

2. Timestep independency test

The ﬂow duration inside the shock tube is of the order
of few milliseconds; however, as it can be seen from Fig-
ure 3, the peak temperature inside the domain happens
to be for few microseconds only. Henceforth, the timestep
of the simulation also plays a vital role in deducing the
proper estimate for the ﬂow properties.
Independency
test for timestep is also ensured through detailed simula-
tions for the initial ﬁlling condition associated to Case-4.
The result for the peak temperature at the focusing point
for diﬀerent time step is shown in Figure 4.

It can be observed that for smaller time steps, the peak
temperature magnitude is almost equal with some dis-
crepancy in trend. Minute variation in temperature pro-
ﬁle with decrement in time step can be ascertained as
the Courant number approaches to unity. Nevertheless,
to reduce the computational cost, 1e−7 is chosen as the
suitable time step for further simulations.

C. Validation of results

After obtaining the optimal meshing and simulation
parameters, to establish the correctness of the numeri-
cally obtained ﬂow parameters, it is thereby planned to

4

validate results with experimental outcomes. In view of
this, simulations are carried out for shock Mach num-
ber of 3.25 with argon as test gas [13]. Argon being a
monoatomic and inert gas, inviscid simulations with per-
fect gas assumption is performed with driven section ﬁll-
ing pressure of 10 kPa. Figure 5 shows the comparison
between experimentally and numerically obtained tem-
poral variations of pressure at the focusing point. The
pressure variation seems to have a good agreement with
the experimental result in terms of trend. However, peak
magnitude for the numerical simulation has a variation of
12.5% as compared to the experimental result. Neverthe-
less, the experimental uncertainty in pressure measure-
ment is also reported to be 12% [14]. The close match of
pressure signal thereby provides conﬁdence for the ﬂow
parameters that is going to be achieved during the actual
test cases.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

After successful validation, simulations are carried out
towards comprehensive investigation of analyzing the be-
havior of shock within the converging section in terms of
variation of ﬂow properties and species concentration.

Initially, perfect gas simulation for Case-1 is performed
to get an idea on the focusing phenomenon. The vari-
ation in the shape of the shock while passing through
the converging section is investigated through detailed
analysis. Change of shock shape from planar to spheri-
cal through gradual curving can be seen from Figure 6.
This transformation of shape mostly relies on the shape
of the converging section, as the shock curving initiates
at the associated wall. Additionally, as the geometry of
the converging section is designed to have less diﬀusion
of the shock, thus it makes the SW foot to remain per-
pendicular to the wall and attains spherical shape with
minimum losses to the shock front.

Six instances of density contour prior to shock arrival
at the focusing point are portrayed in Figure 6. The
axis-symmetric domain is mirrored to obtain a 2D pla-
nar view. The time instance at which the shock reaches

 
 
the focusing point is taken as reference for all the con-
tour plots. At time 277µs before focusing, the shock is
clearly depicted to be a planar shock. However, along
with marching in time, the shock approaches towards the
focusing point and the shape of the shock curves gradu-
ally. At -27µs, spherical curvature of the shock is evident.
Besides, it is noticed that the shock has taken 440µs to
travel the entire converging section; however, had it been
a constant cross-section tube, this time would have been
570µs. Therefore, this clearly indicates that inside the
converging section, the incident shock is accelerating.

In view of this, speed of the shock while moving
through the converging section is estimated to realize the
inﬂuence of focusing phenomenon on the shock strength.
The static pressure proﬁle at various points along the axis
inside the converging section is monitored from which
the shock Mach number is calculated through locating
the time instances of incident shock induced pressure rise
at those points. The initial shock strength of Mach 1.5
gets accelerated to 3.9 Mach as it reaches the focusing
point which can be perceived from Figure 7. This is in
line with the fact that SW accelerates as it encounters a
reduction in the cross-sectional area [22]. Nevertheless,
major component of the shock acceleration happens to
be inside conical insert present at the end of the con-
verging section, where the incident shock strength varies
exponentially.

In perspective of signiﬁcant shock Mach number vari-
ation, ﬂuid properties at diﬀerent time instances along
the axis in the near focus region is quantiﬁed as shown
in Figure 8 . The associated location and shape of in-
cident shock for these time stamps can be depicted from
Figure 9. Drastic increment of all the ﬂow parameters
is observed as shock approaches the focusing point. This

FIG. 8. Flow properties like pressure, temperature, density
and axial velocity monitored along the central axis of the
domain for case M1.5 at four diﬀerent time instances before
focusing

can be merely due to the associated energy of SW getting
concentrated into a very small region. Moreover, expo-
nential increment of shock strength is also a potential
factor in enhancing the ﬂuid property magnitudes. At
the locus of focusing point, the static pressure and tem-
perature values are recorded to be 115 MPa and 5600 K
respectively for the initial ﬁlling conditions correspond-
ing to Case-1.

As the perfect gas simulation resulted in signiﬁcantly
high magnitude of pressure and temperature at the focus-
ing point, it can thereby trigger dissociation of the test
gas viz. air. Therefore, simulations incorporating high
temperature eﬀects are carried out where diﬀerent chem-
ical reactions and temperature dependent ﬂuid property
models are taken into account. Comparative assessment
of perfect gas and high temperature simulations with
the obtained peak values of pressure and temperature
is shown in Figure 10.

After including high temperature eﬀects to the simu-
lation, the decrement in focusing point temperature is
prominent whereas less variation in peak pressure is ob-

 
6

calculated to have an increment of 30% as compared to
the base case which seems to exhibit as an immediate
consequence due to change in ﬁlling pressure. However,
the peak temperature for Case-2 shows a 2% reduction as
compared to Case-1 although the ﬁll temperature is kept
constant. The decrement in temperature is certain, as
this eﬀect along with increment in peak pressure would
lead towards unity compressibility factor. As far as trend
of ﬂow parameters are concerned, eventually for both the
cases, the temperature and pressure proﬁles reach the
equilibrium value at 10 µs after focusing.

The resulted temperature and pressure at the focusing
point turns out to be high enough to activate the dissoci-
ation of the test gas. However, the increased magnitude
holds only for a few microseconds before attaining the
equilibrium values. The mass fraction concentrations of
all the nine species including ions are monitored for both
the test cases during this duration at the focusing point.
The eﬀect of initial ﬁll pressure on the focusing phe-
nomenon is presented in terms of variation in species con-

served. The peak temperature is found to be reduced
from 5600 K to 4000 K while 7% increment in peak pres-
sure is noted. Energy utilization in rotational as well as
vibrational excitation and dissociation of air molecules
would have resulted in the decrement of peak tempera-
ture. Nevertheless, as the compressibility factor of air
approaches one under high temperature and high pres-
sure circumstances; hence, the peak value of pressure
might have increased with peak temperature dropping.
With this insight of high temperature eﬀect, it is thereby
planned to alter the ﬁlling conditions so as to quantify
the ﬂow parameters and species concentration.

A. Eﬀect of initial ﬁll pressure

The initial ﬁll pressure of the test gas is increased by
30% (Case-2) to analyze the eﬀect of the ﬁll pressure on
the shock focusing phenomenon. The static temperature
and pressure monitored throughout the simulation at the
focusing point for the base case along with Case-2 are
shown in Figure 11. The peak pressure magnitude is

centration in Figure 12. The dissociation of N2 and O2
produces ﬁnite amount of atomic nitrogen (N), atomic
oxygen (O) and Nitric oxide (NO). After achieving the
peak magnitude, these species viz. ‘N’, ‘O’ and NO fur-
ther recombines to help in the formation of N2 and O2.
This is evident as the concentration of ‘N’, ‘O’, and NO
continuously decay after attaining a peak value, whereas
mass fractions of N2 and O2 are increasing. After few mi-
crosecond, as species ‘N’ and ‘O’ vanishes; thereafter,N2,
O2 and NO interact among each other through third
body reactions till the attainment of respective equilib-
rium values.

As far as species concentration for both the cases are
concerned, the dissociation of N2 and O2 is observed to
have increased moderately for M1.5-P30. The key rea-
son for higher dissociation could be the increased number
of molecule interactions due to the peak pressure incre-
ment. The peak values of ‘N’ and ‘O’ has reduced with
higher decrement for species ‘N’. However, this reduc-
tion is balanced with increased magnitude of NO species
which enforces the possible recombination of ‘N’ and ‘O’
to form NO. The trend of attaining equilibrium for all
the species is similar in both cases. It is observed that
species ‘N’ and ‘O’ attains equilibrium faster compared
to N2, O2 and NO. The longer time taken by species NO
to reach equilibrium in turn extends the non-equilibrium
duration for N2 and O2. Argon takes the longest dura-
tion to reach equilibrium compared to all other species.
Another observation from the Figure 12 is that the
initial pressure variation in the driven section is largely
aﬀecting the ionization reactions. Noticeable increment
in the peak is observed for the ions. However, the magni-
tude of mass fraction of ions is found to be very less with
Ar+ ion being the lowest which is in the order of 10-16.
The lower concentration of ions is due to unavailability
of enough activation energy to trigger the ionization re-
actions signiﬁcantly. Nevertheless, after attaining equi-
librium, the mass fraction for all species is found to be
same for both the cases which is also equal to the initial
concentration of the test gas. Furthermore, the dura-
tion of the dissociation and ionization reaction is mostly
dependent upon the activation energy magnitude. The
value of the activation energy will be higher during ﬁrst
few microseconds after focusing, and as time elapses, the
magnitude will decrease. However, the activation energy
requirement for ionization is higher followed by dissoci-
ation and recombination reaction. Therefore, as can be
seen from Figure 12, the ionization reaction gets over
ﬁrst and followed by the dissociation reaction.

Case-3 as compared to that of the base case viz. Case-1.
After attaining equilibrium, still the value of temperature
remains high by 14% for M1.5-T30. The static pressure
at the focusing point for M1.5-T30 seems to be unaltered
with respect to M1.5.

FIG. 13. Peak values comparison of temperature and pressure
point showing the eﬀect of initial ﬁll temperature of the test
gas obtained at focusing when the shock strength is main-
tained constant

During the previous case study, it can be seen that ini-
tial pressure increment of 30% resulted in 30% increase
in peak pressure at the focusing point. But in the cur-
rent case, initial temperature rise of 30% yields in 18%
enhancement in the peak temperature. This is mostly
because of the high temperature which resulted in higher
reaction rate for the species thereby utilizing some of the
ﬂow energy in excitation of the molecules. As a result,
eﬀective temperature increment becomes less.

FIG. 14. Species mass fraction variation showing the eﬀect
of initial ﬁll temperature of the test gas obtained at focusing
point when the shock strength is maintained constant. The
magnitude of N O+ and O+ ions of M1.5 is magniﬁed in order
to have a comparative assessment.

The study of initial ﬁll temperature eﬀect is obtained
by varying the driven gas temperature by 30% (Case-3).
The maximum temperature and pressure obtained at the
focusing point due to this alteration is shown in Figure
13. The temperature peak value has increased by 18% for

The eﬀect of initial ﬁll temperature on species concen-
tration is shown in Figure 14. The ﬁll temperature is
found to have much more inﬂuence on the focusing phe-
nomenon than ﬁll pressure. Due to higher temperature,

higher number of molecular collisions per unit time will
take place, which thereby increases the reaction rate and
further the species formation. N2 and O2 dissociation has
increased considerably and therefore higher mass fraction
values for ‘N’, ‘O’ and NO. In contrary to the observation
in Figure 12, here the percentage increment in ‘N’ and
‘O’ species seems to be higher than that of NO species
prediction; therefore, indicating towards more activation
of endothermic dissociation reactions with increased ﬁll
temperature.

The higher equilibrium temperature for M1.5-T30 fur-
ther leads to elevated magnitude of equilibrium species
concentration for N2, O2 and NO species. Simultane-
ously, argon is having third body reaction with oxygen
till it reaches equilibrium value. As, the ionization reac-
tions are dependent on both pressure and temperature
[23]; therefore, signiﬁcant increment is also perceived for
N O+ and O+ ions due to higher ﬁll temperature. But,
upon observation from Figure 12 and Figure 14, it is
clear that the dependency of ion concentration on ﬁll
temperature is much higher as compared to the ﬁll pres-
sure. Also, the maximum mass fraction achieved by Ar+
ion is found to be increased to a range of 10−12. Con-
sequently, the initial ﬁll temperature seems to have a
notable eﬀect on the magnitude of species formation as
compared to the ﬁll pressure.

C. Eﬀect of initial Shock strength

Finally, the eﬀect of shock strength on the shock focus-
ing phenomenon is studied and results are discussed here.
The shock acceleration within the converging section for
both the cases is depicted in Figure 15. The initial per-
centage change of 36% in the shock strength increases to
42% at the focus point. As discussed earlier, the major
acceleration and strengthening of the shock seems to be
happening inside the conical section which is close to the
focusing point.

sure magnitude is having huge increment. This is also in
line with the fact that due to higher Mach numbers, the
pressure ratio will have signiﬁcant increment as compared
to the temperature ratio [24]. It is also noticeable from
the ﬁgure that time taken by the ﬂow to reach equilibrium
state is higher for increased shock strength. Besides, af-
ter also reaching equilibrium, the equilibrium pressure as
well as temperature for M2.05 remains higher than that
of M1.5.

FIG. 17. Species mass fraction variation showing the eﬀect of
initial ﬁll pressure of the test gas obtained at focusing point
when the shock strength is maintained constant

The mass fraction of species monitored at the focusing
point showing the eﬀect of the shock strength is depicted
in Figure 17. With increase in shock strength, the disso-
ciation rate of N2 and O2 is increased, and the formation
of ‘N’, ‘O’, NO and ions has peaked up. The increment
in species concentration is the cumulative eﬀect of incre-
ment in peak pressure and temperature. In line with this,
signiﬁcant increase in species production is observed for
all the species with increase in increase in species produc-
tion is observed for all the species with increase in shock
strength. However, the increment of species ‘N’ is less

as compared to the others as opposing eﬀect is expected
to happen independently for pressure and temperature
rise. For the ions, the diﬀerence in peak value is large
enough that the distribution of M1.5 looks like a straight
line compared to that of M2.05. This shows that the
ionization reaction rate is increased considerably. The
delay in attaining equilibrium for N2, O2 and NO is also
observed.

IV. CONCLUSION

A detailed study on the phenomenon of shock wave fo-
cusing is carried out numerically. Spherical shock wave
focusing is achieved with the help of a perfectly contoured
converging section attached to a shock tube. Computa-
tions with inviscid perfect gas eﬀects as well as with high
temperature eﬀects are carried out with air as test gas.
Dissociation, recombination and ionization reaction com-
prising of nine prominent species including ions (N2, O2,
N, O, NO, Ar, N O+, O+ and Ar+) are incorporated.
Also, consequence of high temperature eﬀect is assessed
through comparative assessment of the peak temperature
and pressure obtained at the focusing point. The eﬀect
of initial ﬁll condition and initial shock strength on the
focusing phenomenon is also studied. During assessing
the eﬀect of initial ﬁll condition, ﬁll temperature and ﬁll
pressure is independently increased by 30%. Neverthe-
less, the eﬀect of altering the ﬁlling temperature seems
to have noteworthy eﬀect on focused regime.

As direct consequence of change in ﬁll pressure, the
peak pressure at the focusing point is increased by 30%
while the peak temperature reduces marginally with in-
creased value of NO. However, decrement in species ‘N’
and ‘O’ is perceived. With 30% increase in the ﬁll tem-
perature, the peak pressure remains same whereas peak
temperature at the focusing point is increased by 18%
as the remaining energy is utilized in excitation of the
molecules. The enhanced number of molecular collision
has resulted signiﬁcant increment in all the species con-
centration. The dependence of ionization rate is also
found to be much more receptive towards the ﬁll temper-
ature rather than ﬁll pressure. Finally, the eﬀect of shock
strength is evaluated which indicates increment in both
peak temperature as well as peak pressure due to higher
shock Mach number in the near focus region. Moreover,
this resulted in analyzing combining eﬀect of the afore-
mentioned variations. This in turn inﬂuence the species
concentration where huge variation in all species concen-
tration is obtained except for ‘N’ due to conﬂicting eﬀect
is expected to happen independently for pressure and
temperature rise. All the ion formation is also seen to
have towering increment.
