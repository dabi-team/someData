Positronium (Ps) scattering by noble-gas atoms (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) is studied in the frozen-target
approximation and with inclusion of the van der Waals interaction. Single-particle electron and positron states in
the ﬁeld of the target atom are calculated, with the system enclosed by a hard spherical wall. The two-particle Ps
wave function is expanded in these states, and the Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized, giving the Ps energy levels
in the cavity. Scattering phase shifts, scattering lengths, and cross sections are extracted from these energies and
compared with existing calculations and experimental data. Analysis of the eﬀect of the van der Waals interaction
shows that it cannot explain the recent experimental data of Brawley et al. for Ar and Xe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,
223201 (2015)].

INTRODUCTION

In this paper a new theoretical method for the calculation of
positronium-atom scattering is developed. It involves conﬁning
the electron-positron pair to a large sphere with the atom placed
at the centre. The scattering problem is thus reduced to the
calculation of bound states. This enables us to obtain converged
results that fully allow for the distortion of positronium. This
is also an important step towards the development of a many-
body-theory approach to the problem.

The interaction of positronium (Ps) with matter and antimat-
ter is an interesting topic [1] with applications in many areas
of physics. For example, the proposed AEgIS and GBAR ex-
periments at CERN [2, 3] aim to test whether gravity aﬀects
antimatter in the same way as matter, making antihydrogen in
Ps collisions with antiprotons, with Ps produced in a meso-
porous material [4]. Ps is widely utilized in condensed-matter
physics to determine pore sizes in nanoporous materials and to
probe intermolecular voids in polymers [5]. Moreover, Ps for-
mation in porous materials is used to study its interactions with
gases, e.g., Xe [6, 7], or the interaction between the Ps atoms
themselves [8–11], with prospects of room-temperature Bose-
Einstein condensation and an annihilation gamma laser [12–
14]. There are also proposals for using a beam of long-lived
Rydberg Ps for measuring the free fall of a matter-antimatter
system [15] and for detecting positron-atom bound states [16].
In this work we consider low-energy Ps scattering from
noble-gas atoms. Experiments found that for energies above
the Ps breakup threshold (6.8 eV), the total Ps scattering cross
sections for atoms and small molecules are similar to those
of electrons of equal velocity [17, 18], as though the positron
played no part in the scattering. An explanation of this phe-
nomenon was obtained using the impulse approximation [19].
Recent measurements for Ar and Xe indicate that at low ener-
gies the Ps-atom scattering cross section becomes very small,
suggesting that a Ramsauer minimum may be present [20]. So
far this behavior has not been reproduced by the calculations

[21, 22], and one of the aims of our paper is to subject this
phenomenon to a closer scrutiny.

Besides the experiments that use a Ps beam [23], low-energy
Ps-atom scattering is studied indirectly through positron anni-
hilation in gases, where it determines the rate of Ps thermaliza-
tion. The latter is important for precision measurements that
test QED in this purely leptonic system [24]. However, there is
little accord among the published data on the Ps momentum-
transfer cross sections (see below), and we hope that the present
calculations can provide some certainty here.

Ps-atom scattering has been a diﬃcult subject to research
theoretically, since both the target and projectile have an in-
ternal structure. The earliest calculation was carried out in
1954 by Massey and Mohr [25]; they studied Ps-H collisions
in the ﬁrst Born approximation and in the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation, and emphasized the importance of electron ex-
change. With particular regard to the noble gases, there is a
wealth of theoretical calculations for low-energy Ps scatter-
ing from helium. Fraser [26, 27] and Fraser and Kraidy [28]
initiated the study of Ps-He scattering using a static-exchange
approach, with both the Ps and He atoms “frozen” in their
ground states. Barker and Bransden [29, 30] considered the
problem both in the static-exchange approximation and includ-
ing the adiabatic part of the van der Waals potential. Drachman
and Houston [31] estimated the scattering length and pickoﬀ
annihilation rate using a model potential. Interest in the sub-
ject waned after 1970, until McAlinden et al. revisited it in
1996 [32], using the target-elastic pseudostate close-coupling
method and neglecting electron exchange between the Ps and
the atom. Shortly thereafter, Sarkar and Ghosh [33] presented
scattering phase shifts and cross sections found using a static-
exchange model. The year 1999 saw much development on the
topic: Biswas and Adhikari [34] and Sarkar et al. [35] per-
formed three-state [Ps(1s,2s,2p)-He(1s2)] close-coupling cal-
culations, while Blackwood et al. [36] improved upon the work
of McAlinden et al. [32] by accounting for exchange. Further
calculations using the close-coupling method appeared within
the next two years [37–39]. From 2001, calculations employ-
ing variational methods began to appear in the literature: Ad-
hikari [40] considered S-wave Ps-He scattering and obtained
an estimate for the scattering length, while Ivanov et al. [41]
and Mitroy and Ivanov [42] used the ﬁxed-core stochastic-

 
 
 
 
 
 
variational method with one- and two-body polarization po-
tentials to ﬁnd low-energy S-wave phase shifts and scattering
lengths. Chiesa et al. [43] applied the diﬀusion Monte Carlo
method to compute phase shifts and threshold cross sections.
In 2003, DiRenzi and Drachman [44] noted the vast discrep-
ancy between the earlier work [31] and Ref. [36] and undertook
a reexamination of the former work; they concluded that an as-
sumption made therein (that the direct potential was negligible
in comparison to the exchange potential) was not quantitatively
correct. A 2004 work by Walters et al. [45] presented new re-
sults in the pseudostate-close-coupling framework, now allow-
ing for excitations of the target He atom in addition to the Ps
atom. Most recently, DiRenzi and Drachman [46] calculated
the Ps-He scattering length using a variational wave function.

Calculations of low-energy Ps scattering on the other noble-
gas atoms (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) are much more sparse. The
earliest calculations we are aware of were by McAlinden et al.
[32], who considered Ps scattering on Ar (in addition to H and
He) using the pseudostate-close-coupling method, neglecting
the eﬀects of electron exchange [32]. Biswas and Adhikari
[47] similarly used the coupled-channel framework to inves-
tigate Ps scattering from H, He, Ne, and Ar. In addition to
Ps-He scattering, Mitroy and Ivanov [42] applied the ﬁxed-
core stochastic-variational method to study Ps scattering from
Ne, Ar, Li+, Na+, and K+; Mitroy and Bromley [48] extended
this work to scattering from Kr and Xe. Blackwood et al.
[49, 50] developed a coupled-state treatment for Ps scattering
from Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the frozen-target approximation;
for Kr and Xe the incident Ps was also frozen in its ground
state. Finally, Fabrikant and Gribakin [21] and Gribakin et al.
[22] employed a pseudopotential method to study low-energy
Ps collisions with Ar, Kr, and Xe.

On the experimental front, there were several studies of Ps
scattering on the noble gases [17, 51–62]. Most of these deter-
mined momentum-transfer cross sections at energies below the
Ps ionization potential (6.8 eV), and some inferred zero-energy
elastic cross sections. Direct measurements of the elastic cross
section for energies below 6.8 eV have only been carried out
recently, and only for Ar and Xe [20].

In this work we present new theoretical calculations of Ps
scattering on He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe at energies below the
Ps ionization potential. A B-spline basis [63–65] is used to
construct states of Ps in the ﬁeld of the target atom, and the
entire system is enclosed in an impenetrable spherical cavity.
Apart from the presence of the atom, most details of the calcu-
lation are similar to our earlier study of Ps states in an empty
spherical cavity [66]. Here we initially use the frozen-target
approximation, where distortion of the Ps is accounted for, but
the target atom is “frozen” in its ground state. Subsequently, the
long-range van der Waals interaction between the target and
projectile is included using a model potential. Scattering phase
shifts, scattering lengths, and elastic and momentum-transfer
cross sections are recorded, and comparisons are made with
existing calculations and experimental data.

Unless otherwise stated, atomic units (a.u.) are used
throughout; the symbol a0 denotes the Bohr radius (the atomic
unit of length).

A. Frozen-target approximation

The electron density and electrostatic potential of a noble-
gas atom in the ground state are described well by the Hartree-
Fock approximation. The total Hamiltonian for Ps in the static
Hartree-Fock ﬁeld of the atom placed at the origin is

where re (rp) is the position of the electron (positron) in Ps
relative to the nucleus of the target atom, Ue (Up) is the static
potential of the target atom for the electron (positron) in Ps, and
1 is the Coulomb interaction between
V
the electron and positron in Ps. The atomic potential Ue is the
sum of the direct and (nonlocal) exchange potentials, while Up
consists only of the direct potential.

The entire system is enclosed by an impenetrable spherical
wall of radius Rc centered on the target atom; consequently, all
Ps states are discrete [66]. This hard-wall cavity is a key feature
of our method. Values of Rc are chosen in such a way that the
cavity does not aﬀect the atomic ground state and allows for an
accurate description of Ps “bouncing” oﬀ the atom (Sec. III).
This enables us to determine Ps-atom scattering phase shifts
from the discrete energy eigenvalues (Sec. II B).

To solve the Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian (1),
we ﬁrst consider single-particle electron and positron states in

positron states separated into angular and radial parts, integra-
tion over the angular variables and coupling of the angular mo-
menta in Eq. (3) are performed analytically (see Appendix A
of Ref. [66] for details).

where K is the Ps center-of-mass momentum and m = 2 is the
mass of Ps. The Ps eigenstates in the cavity are characterized by
the radial and orbital quantum numbers of the center-of-mass
motion, which we denote by N and L, respectively. The means
of determining N and L for each Ps eigenstate is detailed in

Ref. [66]; for Ps
states matters are simpliﬁed by the fact

As usual, the phase shifts are determined to within nπ, where n

it is convenient to require that δL

The method of ﬁnding the phase shifts described above is
known as the “box-variational method.” It has been used spo-
radically in various situations [68–71]. We believe, however,
that this is the ﬁrst time that the method has been used to study
the scattering of a composite particle.

Once the phase shifts have been found for selected values of
the Ps momentum, eﬀective-range-type ﬁts are used to deter-
mine δL for an arbitrary low momentum K. In the frozen-target
approximation, the atomic potential is of short range, and the
eﬀective-range expansion for the Lth partial wave is [67]

As the scattering cross section may be sensitive to the choice
of R0 (which at this stage is somewhat arbitrary), it is useful to
consider the “strength” of this potential. The attractive strength
of a generic spherically symmetric potential U

mated by the following dimensionless parameter [74, 75]:

(27)

Thus, the strength of the van der Waals potential increases
rapidly with decreasing R0, conﬁrming that the cross section
may be sensitive to the choice of R0. For instance, decreasing
R0 from a value of 3.0 a.u. to 2.5 a.u. increases the strength
S by a factor of 2. This sensitivity, however, is mitigated by
the strongly repulsive static Ps-atom interaction, which means
that the probably of ﬁnding the Ps center of mass at small R is
quite small.

III. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

The long-range interaction between the Ps and the target
atom is described by the van der Waals potential, which arises

First, we use a standard Hartree-Fock program [76] to gener-
ate the ground-state electron orbitals of the target atom. These

wave functions are used to generate the electron- and positron-
atom potentials Ue and Up. Then, a B-spline basis is used to
construct the single-particle electron and positron basis states

and B is a parameter; a value of B = 100 has been used
throughout. This knot sequence simultaneously provides an
accurate representation of the atomic ground-state orbitals and
the positive-energy electron and positron states [78].

In this work we carry out calculations using four diﬀerent
cavity radii, namely, Rc = 10, 12, 14, and 16 a.u. Keeping
the cavity radius small assists convergence of the expansion
(3). For D-wave scattering with the van der Waals interaction,
the phase shifts are very small (see Fig. 2), and a fair amount
of scatter was observed among the data points. We therefore
ran the D-wave calculations using an additional value, Rc =
15 a.u., to reduce the uncertainty in the eﬀective-range ﬁts. In
any case, the D-wave partial elastic cross sections are small
(in the van der Waals approximation) and contribute little to
the elastic cross section in the energy range considered. A set
of 60 B splines of order 9 has been used throughout.

To study S-, P-, and D-wave scattering of Ps(1s), it is neces-
sary to construct Ps states in the ﬁeld of each of the ﬁve target
atoms with J Π = 0+, 1−, and 2+ respectively. The dimension

where lmax is the maximum orbital angular momentum and

IV. RESULTS

A. Scattering phase shifts

Figure 1 shows the S-, P-, and D-wave phase shifts for
Ps scattering on He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the frozen-target
approximation. Shown by crosses are the phase shifts ob-
tained from Eq. (14) for diﬀerent center-of-mass motion states
of Ps(1s) and diﬀerent cavity radii Rc. Solid lines represent
eﬀective-range-type ﬁts of the data (see Appendix C for de-
tails). The phase shifts are negative, which indicates that in the
frozen-target approximation the Ps-atom interaction is repul-
sive. Also shown are the phase shifts from the static-exchange
calculations for He [33] and pseudopotential calculations for
Ar, Kr, and Xe [21, 22].

Compared to the frozen-target approximation, the static-
exchange calculations do not allow for the distortion of Ps in
the ﬁeld of the atom. Nevertheless, there is close agreement
between the two sets of data for He. At increasing Ps momenta,
the static-exchange phase shifts [33] are slightly more negative
than the present phase shifts. This could be expected, since the
distortion of Ps allowed by the frozen-target approximation
softens the Ps-atom repulsion. A similar diﬀerence between
the static-exchange and frozen-target approximation was noted
earlier by Blackwood et al. for He, Ne and Ar [36, 49].

For Ar, Kr, and Xe, there is fairly good agreement with
the pseudopotential calculations [21, 22], in which the pseu-
dopotential was designed to represent the Ps-atom interaction
at the static-exchange level. The largest discrepancy in each
case is for the P wave. As noted by Gribakin et al. [22], the
pseudopotential method likely overestimates the P-wave con-
tribution to the scattering, so the present P-wave phase shifts
for Ar, Kr, and Xe should be considered superior at this level
of approximation.

Figure 2 shows the eﬀect of including the van der Waals in-
teraction on the phase shifts. Here we only present the eﬀective-
range-type ﬁts of the data (see Appendix C for the ﬁts used),
to avoid cluttering the plots. To examine the sensitivity of the
results to the choice of the cutoﬀ radius, we have used two val-
ues for each target atom: R0 = 2.5 a.u. and 3.0 a.u. for He, Ne,
and Ar; R0 = 3.0 a.u. and 3.5 a.u. for Kr and Xe. These values
are similar to those used in Refs. [21, 22], which ensured that
the calculated cross section merged with experimental data for
K > 1 a.u. Since the van der Waals interaction is attractive, the
corresponding phase shifts lie higher than their frozen-target
counterparts, and the D-wave phase shifts are positive at small
K, as predicted by Eqs. (18c) and (19). In spite of the strong
dependence of the van der Waals strength parameter (27) on
the cutoﬀ radius, the phase shifts obtained using two diﬀerent
values of R0 for each atom are quite close. This is a conse-
quence of the strong static Ps-atom repulsion, which reduces
the probability of ﬁnding the Ps center of mass at small dis-
tances, where the short-range part of the model van der Waals
potential (24) is strongest.

Also shown in Fig. 2 are static-exchange–with–van-der-
Waals phase shifts of Barker and Bransden [30] for He, and
pseudopotential calculations with the van der Waals interaction
for Ar, Kr, and Xe [21, 22]. There is reasonably good agree-

B. Scattering lengths and cross sections

We will consider scattering lengths and elastic cross sections

for He separately from the other four atoms.

For Ps-He scattering a scattering length of A = 1.86 a.u. was
obtained in the frozen-target approximation, corresponding to
a zero-energy cross section of 13.8πa2
0. With inclusion of the
van der Waals potential this reduced to A = 1.61 a.u. for
R0 = 3.0 a.u., or A = 1.52 a.u. for R0 = 2.5 a.u., giving zero-
energy cross sections of 10.4πa2
0, respectively.

FIG. 2. S-, P-, and D-wave scattering phase shifts for Ps scattering on He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe with inclusion of the van der Waals interaction.
Solid purple lines, eﬀective-range ﬁts for δ0; solid green lines, eﬀective-range ﬁts for δ1; solid blue lines, eﬀective-range ﬁts for δ2. For each
partial wave, the lower (higher) curve corresponds to the larger (smaller) cutoﬀ radius (see text for values of R0). Dotted lines in the same colors
show the ﬁts of the frozen-target phase shifts presented in Fig. 1. Dashed lines in the same colors show the results of other calculations that
include the van der Waals interaction: for He these are the static-exchange–with–van-der-Waals phase shifts of Barker and Bransden [30], and
the pseudopotential phase shifts of Fabrikant and Gribakin [21] (Ar and Kr) and Gribakin et al. [22] (Xe).

Table I shows these data along with a selection of previous
results.

Blackwood et al. [36] used the R-matrix method in a vari-
ety of approximations. Their static-exchange calculation gave
A = 1.91 a.u., in contrast with the earlier converged result of
A = 1.80 a.u. of Barker and Bransden [29]. A contributing fac-
tor to the discrepancy between these values may be that Black-

wood et al. [36] used a Hartree-Fock wave function for the
He atom, whereas Barker and Bransden [29] used only a sin-
gle Slater-type orbital. Blackwood et al. [36] then allowed for
distortion of the Ps projectile using a channel space of 22 cou-
pled pseudostates, but retained the He atom in its ground state.
The scattering length of this calculation was A = 1.82 a.u., in
agreement with the present frozen-target result at the level of

Basu et al. [39] used the momentum-space T -matrix ap-
proach in the static-exchange approximation, obtaining A =
1.93 a.u., in good agreement with the R-matrix value [36].
They then allowed for limited distortion of the Ps atom by per-
forming a calculation with the Ps(1s), Ps(2s), and Ps(2p) states,
and the scattering length changed by only 0.5%. They also con-
sidered excitations of the target He atom into its 1s 2s 1Se and
1s 2p 1Po states. The inclusion of these excitations led to a
greatly reduced scattering length of 1.36 a.u. (using only the
Ps(1s) and Ps(2p) states). Similar results were obtained by
Ghosh et al. [38]. This indicates that excitations of the target
atom (which can give rise to the van der Waals interaction) are
important and should be included. However, their values are
about 10% lower than the smaller of the present two van der
Waals scattering lengths (1.52 a.u. for R0 = 2.5 a.u.).

There were also T -matrix calculations by Biswas and Ad-
hikari [47] and Adhikari [37], but they are in serious conﬂict
with those of Ghosh and coworkers [38, 39], who used an
identical method. Mitroy and Ivanov [42] stated that Adhikari
and coworkers’ model exchange interaction was of “dubious
validity” and noted that doubt had already been raised about
these calculations by other authors [36, 79].

Mitroy and Ivanov [42] employed the ﬁxed-core stochastic-
variational method, allowing for distortion of the Ps projec-
tile but not the He atom, and found A = 1.84 a.u., which is
within 1% of the present frozen-target value. Model electron-
and positron-atom polarization potentials were then added,
leading to a scattering length of 1.57 a.u. (a 15% reduc-
tion), which is within 2–3% of our van der Waals values.

These data are in close agreement with the earlier static-
exchange [29] and static-exchange–with–van-der-Waals [30]
calculations. We note again the importance of accounting for
distortion of the target atom. The most sophisticated R-matrix
calculation of Walters et al. [45] included nine Ps states and
nine He states, leading to a scattering length of 1.6 a.u., sup-
porting the results of the earlier van der Waals calculations
[30, 42] and in near-perfect agreement with the present van
der Waals value of 1.61 a.u. (for R0 = 3.0 a.u.). Allowing for
a
5% error in the scattering length, we show recommended
values of the scattering length and zero-energy cross section
in the last line of Table I.

∼

Figure 3 shows the partial and total elastic cross sections for
Ps-He scattering in the frozen-target approximation. One can
see that the P wave is unimportant for K . 0.2 a.u. and the
D wave is unimportant for K . 0.6 a.u. Even at K = 1 a.u.
the D wave adds little to the total elastic cross section. Also
shown on the graph is the result of the R-matrix calculation of
Blackwood et al. [36], where 22 Ps states were included but
the He atom was frozen. The small diﬀerence in the region
K
0.2 a.u., may be related, at least in part, to uncertainties
of our ﬁt of the S-wave phase shift at low K (cf. Fig.1). This
diﬀerence aside, the agreement between the cross sections
obtained in the same approximation using two very diﬀerent
methods conﬁrms the validity of the present method of solving
the Ps-atom scattering problem using a hard-wall cavity.

≤

Figure 4 shows the partial and total elastic cross sections
for Ps-He scattering with inclusion of the van der Waals in-
teraction. Adding the attractive van der Waals potential to
the repulsive frozen-target Ps-atom interaction leads to a 20–
30% reduction in the cross section. The cross sections for
R0 = 2.5 a.u. and 3.0 a.u. are quite close; there is only a
13% diﬀerence at zero energy. This relative insensitivity to
the value of the cutoﬀ radius may seem surprising, given that

(for R0 = 2.5 a.u.). However, for R < 3 a.u., the relative eﬀect
of static repulsion is already quite strong, so that the change of
has a relatively small eﬀect. The D-wave partial cross
VW
section is negligible across the energy range considered and
barely visible in Fig. 4. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the 9-Ps-9-He-
state calculation of Walters et al. [45], which accounted for
Ps and target excitation rigorously using pseudostates. Their
result is close to our cross section for R0 = 3.0 a.u. This shows
that a model-potential approach with an adjustable cutoﬀ can
be used to account for the Ps-atom dispersion forces.

Figure 5 shows the calculated momentum-transfer cross sec-
tions along with some experimental data; also shown are our
elastic cross sections. Away from K = 0, the momentum-
transfer cross section drops below the elastic cross section,
rapidly in the frozen-target approximation, but more gradually
when the van der Waals interaction is included. This is due
to the interference between the S and P waves, and due to
noticeable decrease in the absolute values of the P-wave phase
shifts produced by the van der Waals interaction. At higher
energies, the three momentum-transfer cross sections (frozen
target, and van der Waals with R0 = 3.0 a.u. and 2.5 a.u.) co-
alesce much sooner than the analogous elastic cross sections.
The zero-energy cross sections of Canter et al. [51], Rytsola et
al. [52], and Coleman et al. [53] are in good agreement with our
R0 = 2.5 a.u. cross section. The measurement by Nagashima
et al. [57] is in perfect agreement with our frozen-target cal-
culation, and owing to the large error bars, is compatible with
the van der Waals cross sections. Our calculations do not agree
with the measurements of Skalsey et al. [60] or Engbrecht et
al. [61], though we note that the results of Engbrecht et al. [61]
disagree with the other low-energy measurements.

2. Ps scattering on Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe

Table II shows the scattering lengths and zero-energy cross
sections obtained for Ps scattering on Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe from
the present and earlier calculations. We note again that the
T -matrix calculations [47] for Ne and Ar are of questionable
reliability; hence, we do not discuss them below.

We ﬁrst consider the frozen-target results. For Ps scatter-
ing on Ne, we obtained a scattering length of 2.02 a.u., in
exact agreement with the frozen-target stochastic-variational
calculation of Mitroy and Ivanov [42], and in close agreement
with the 22-Ps-state close-coupling calculation [49]. For Ps
scattering on Ar, Kr, and Xe, the agreement with Mitroy and
coworkers [42, 48] is at the level of 1.4%, 2.2%, and 4.5%
respectively. For Ar, Kr, and Xe we can also compare with
the static-exchange pseudopotential results of Fabrikant and
Gribakin [21] and Gribakin et al. [22]; the respective relative
diﬀerences are 12%, 6.3%, and 2.2%. Bearing in mind that the
pseudopotential method uses only approximate electron- and
positron-atom potentials and does not allow for distortion of
the Ps projectile, the present scattering lengths should be con-
sidered superior. However, the agreement between the present
method and the pseudopotential method increases as we move
down the noble-gas group of the Periodic Table. This may
imply that the pseudopotential method works best for heavier
atoms. The 22-Ps-state close-coupling calculation [49] for Ar
is also in excellent agreement with ours (within 1%).

We now turn to the calculations that include the van der
Waals interaction. As in He, the van der Waals potential miti-
gates the Ps-atom repulsion of the frozen-target approximation
and reduces the magnitudes of the scattering lengths. For Ne

we obtained A = 1.66 a.u. (1.43 a.u.) using a cutoﬀ radius of
R0 = 3.0 a.u. (2.5 a.u.); this is in agreement with the result
of Mitroy and Ivanov [42] at the level of 7% (6%). Similarly
to He, the results obtained with the two cutoﬀ radii are quite
close. For Ar, the C6 constant is almost four times larger than
for Ne, and the eﬀect of the van der Waals potential is con-
siderably greater. Here, the two scattering lengths we obtained
are 2.16 a.u. (R0 = 3.0 a.u.) and 1.43 a.u. (R0 = 2.5 a.u.), in
agreement with the results of Mitroy and Ivanov [42] at the
20%. The value for the larger cutoﬀ (2.16 a.u.) is
level of
close to the pseudopotential value of 2.14 a.u. [21]. Moving
to Kr, for which we have used R0 = 3.5 and 3.0 a.u., our
scattering lengths are respectively 30% and 14% greater than
the stochastic-variational calculation [48]; however, the agree-

∼

10

ment with the pseudopotential calculation [21] is much better,
with an error of 4–9%. Lastly, for Xe, the present scattering
lengths are 15–25% larger than the stochastic-variational value
[48] and 7–18% larger than the pseudopotential value [22]. It
is worth noting that for both Kr and Xe, the scattering lengths
we obtained for R0 = 3.0 and 3.5 a.u. diﬀer by only 10–15%.
One reason for the discrepancies with the stochastic-
variational calculations [42, 48] may be that they account for
the long-range Ps-atom interactions by means of electron- and
positron-atom polarization potentials along with the two-body
polarization potential [see Eqs. (8)–(10) in Ref. [42]]. This
R6 at
C6
does lead to an eﬀective van der Waals potential
/
large R, with the van der Waals constant given by C6 = α

,

where α is the static dipole polarizability of the target atom
= 12 a.u. is the mean squared radius of ground-state
and
Ps [21]. For example, estimating C6 for Ps-Xe interactions
in this way gives C6
28 a.u. [80]),

when the true value is C6
227 a.u. [73]. It therefore appears
that Mitroy and coworkers [42, 48] may have overestimated
the strength of the long-range Ps-atom interaction, leading to
smaller scattering lengths.

Table II also lists our recommended values of the scattering
lengths and zero-energy cross sections, based on the available
data. Their uncertainties are related to the choice of the cutoﬀ
radius and the discrepancies between diﬀerent methods.

Figure 6 shows the partial and total cross sections for Ps
scattering on Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe in the frozen-target ap-
proximation. The contribution of the P wave is negligible for
K < 0.2 a.u., and the D wave only gives a noticeable contribu-
tion for K & 0.5 a.u. Agreement of the elastic cross section for
Ne and Ar with the 22-Ps-state calculations of Blackwood et
al. [49] is excellent. For Kr and Xe, Blackwood et al. [49, 50]
only performed static-exchange calculations; the agreement
is still generally good, though there are some discrepancies
at low energies for Kr and high energies for Xe. The pseu-
dopotential calculations [21, 22] should be equivalent to the
static-exchange calculation. Compared to the other calcula-
tions, they show too much structure for Ar and Xe, which may
be due to an overestimated P-wave contribution (cf. Fig. 1),
but look reasonable for Kr.

For a more detailed comparison, Fig. 7 shows our partial
cross sections σL (L = 0, 1, 2) for Ne and Ar in the frozen-
target approximation and the corresponding results of the R-
matrix calculations by Blackwood et al. [49]. With the excep-
tion of S-wave scattering on Ar at low energies, the two sets
of calculations are practically indistinguishable. For S-wave
scattering on Ar, there is a few-percent discrepancy at low K,
but the overall agreement is still very good. This is evidence
of the accuracy of our method of extracting scattering phase
shifts from the Ps energy levels in the cavity.

≤

In our calculations it was not possible to calculate the F-
wave scattering phase shifts at the same level of accuracy as
those with L
2 [due to the increase in the size of the Hamil-
tonian matrix, cf. Eq. (30)]. The calculations of Blackwood
et al. [49, 50] did include this and higher partial waves. The
agreement that we observe between their results and ours for
He, Ne, Ar, and Kr up to K = 1 a.u. indicates that the con-
tribution from the L
3 partial waves is negligible in the

ment is poorer at high energies, which may be an indication
that the contribution of the F-wave is more important here.

the contribution of higher partial waves in the energy range
considered; indeed, the L > 1 partial waves are essentially
negligible for Ne and Ar.

For Ar and Xe, Fig. 6 also shows the experimental data of
Brawley et al. [20]. These have a qualitatively diﬀerent be-
haviour, with the cross section becoming smaller at lower mo-
menta. Note though that the higher-energy data (K > 0.8 a.u.)
are closer to the calculated values.

Figure 8 shows the total and partial elastic cross sections for
Ps scattering on Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe with inclusion of the van der
Waals interaction, using two cutoﬀ radii for each atom. After
the inclusion of the van der Waals interaction, the present cross
sections retain the basic shape of their frozen-target counter-
parts in Fig. 6, i.e., featureless and generally slowly decreasing.
The relative decrease of each zero-energy cross section from
its frozen-target value lies in the range 32–48% for all tar-
get atoms and cutoﬀ radii, except for Ar with R0 = 2.5 a.u.,
for which the decrease is 74%. This, and the earlier examina-
tion of the scattering lengths for Ar in Table II, indicates that
this cutoﬀ radius is too small for Ar and the cross section for
R0 = 3.0 a.u. is more physical. We note that the additional
attraction due to the van der Waals interaction, which counters
the repulsive short-range static atomic potential, suppresses

There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between our cross sections
and the pseudopotential calculations that used the same van
der Waals potential [21, 22]. The present calculations do not
support the appearance of broad maxima in Ar, Kr and Xe, or
the low-K minimum for Ar. We believe that these diﬀerences
are due to the approximate treatment of the Ps interaction with
the static atomic ﬁeld by the pseudopotential method, which
particularly aﬀects the P wave. We also note that inclusion of
the van der Waals interaction does not resolve the discrepancy
between the calculated cross sections and the measurements
by Brawley et al. [20] for Ar and Xe.

Figure 9 shows the calculated momentum-transfer cross sec-
tions along with experimental data; also shown are our elastic
cross sections. The level of agreement between our calculations
and the experimental data is mixed. For Ne, the data of Skalsey
et al. [60] and Nagashima et al. [59] are in closest agreement
with our van der Waals calculation with R0 = 3.0 a.u., though
both have large error bars. The zero-energy cross section of
Coleman et al. [53] is in better agreement with our curve for
R0 = 2.5 a.u. For Ar, the measurements of Coleman et al. [53]

and the value from Nagashima et al. [54] is closer our curve

is much lower than any of our calculations, and seems to con-
tradict the earlier experimental data.

There are no measurements of the momentum-transfer cross
section for Kr. For Xe, the only measurement is by Shibuya et
al. [7]; their value is about 50% lower than the smallest of our
theoretical predictions. Such a large diﬀerence could be at least
partly due to the way in which the authors of Ref. [7] deduced
this datum. They compared the measured time evolution of
the Ps center-of-mass energy E

V. CONCLUSIONS

A new method has been developed to study Ps-atom inter-
actions and has been applied to Ps scattering from the noble
gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe). The main idea of the method is
to calculate the states of Ps in a hard-wall cavity with the atom
at the center. To implement this, a B-spline basis was used
to construct single-particle electron and positron states in the
static ﬁeld of the target atom, with the entire system enclosed
by an impenetrable spherical wall. The Ps wave function was
obtained as an expansion in the single-particle basis states. Di-
agonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix allowed the Ps energy
levels to be found. From these the scattering phase shifts were
determined, and scattering lengths and cross sections were
computed for each target atom.

Comparisons were made with existing static-exchange, R-
matrix, T -matrix, variational, and pseudopotential calcula-
tions. Scattering lengths were found to be in agreement with the
ﬁxed-core stochastic-variational results of Mitroy and cowork-
ers [42, 48], and partial elastic cross sections matched the
results of Blackwood et al. [49, 50] at the same level of ap-
proximation. Both comparisons attest to the accuracy of our
method and its suitability for studying Ps-atom interactions.

The calculations were repeated with the long-range van der
Waals interaction included by means of a model potential with
an adjustable short-range cutoﬀ parameter R0. This allowed us
to investigate the eﬀect of dispersive forces on Ps-atom scat-
tering. In most cases, the results were not very sensitive to the
choice of the cutoﬀ radius for physically motivated values of R0
(close to the sum of the atomic and Ps radii). For He, good ac-
cord was found with a previous calculation [45] that accounted
for virtual excitation of both the Ps and He atoms. Agreement
for the other target atoms with stochastic-variational [42, 48]
(for scattering lengths) and pseudopotential [21, 22] (for cross
sections) calculations was varied. This was attributed to diﬀer-
ent ways of treating the dispersive interaction (for the former)
or the static Ps-atom interaction (for the latter). Nevertheless,
we were able to establish recommended values of the Ps-atom
scattering lengths and zero-energy cross sections, with error
bars reﬂecting the above discrepancies.

Comparisons with experiment were possible at the level
of momentum-transfer cross sections inferred from Ps ther-
malization (typically at K < 0.5 a.u.), and elastic scattering
cross sections for Ar and Xe for 0.4 < K < 1 a.u. For He,
Ne, and Ar, some agreement was observed with a range of
momentum-transfer data at low energies, partly assisted by
large experimental error bars and some uncertainties in the
calculations, related to the choice of R0. Our calculations of
the elastic cross sections for Ar and Xe disagree with the exper-
imental observation of the cross section becoming very small

at low Ps energies [20]. The discrepancy is beyond the theoret-
ical uncertainty due to the choice of R0, and eﬀectively rules
out the possibility of a Ramsauer-Townsend-type minimum
(a conclusion also supported by the study of the phase-shift
behavior).

The general trends we have observed are as follows. At
the level of the static (frozen-target) approximation, the Ps-
atom interaction is repulsive. It is more repulsive for heavier
(i.e., larger) atoms, producing the cross sections that increase
along the noble-gas-atom sequence. Thus, the cross section
for Ne is only slightly larger that that for He, while the the
cross sections for Ar and Kr are greater by a factor of 2, and
for Xe, by a factor of 3. Adding the attractive van der Waals
interaction moderately reduces the Ps-atom repulsion. As a
result, the cross sections become smaller by 30–50%, with
the eﬀect being slightly larger for the heaver atoms, which
have larger C6 constants. It is interesting to contrast this with
the role of correlation eﬀects (i.e., polarization and virtual
Ps formation) in low-energy positron-atom scattering, where
the cross sections change dramatically, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, in some cases by orders of magnitude [83, 84].

Looking ahead, the present method opens a new way for
including correlation eﬀects in Ps-atom interaction in a sys-

tematic ab initio manner. This can be done by using many-body
theory, which allows one to study properties of small and large
atoms (e.g., He and Xe) with a similar level of accuracy (see,
e.g., Refs. [77, 84–86], where this has been implemented for
positron-atom and positron-ion collisions and annihilation).
Such treatment should overcome the deﬁciencies of the model-
van-der-Waals-potential approach and should enable one to
calculate not only the scattering cross sections but also the
Ps-atom pickoﬀ annihilation rates.

Appendix B: Collisional radius of positronium

K
In Ref. [66] the dependence of the collisional radius ρ
)
(
of Ps(1s) on the Ps center-of-mass momentum K was given as
a linear ﬁt, viz.,

= 1.65

K

ρ
(

)

−

0.51K.

(B1)

K

This simple ﬁt was determined by calculating Ps energy levels
in an otherwise empty cavity with Rc = 10 and 12 a.u. It gives
a good overall description of the momentum dependence of
ρ
. However, it is not suﬃciently accurate for extracting
(
the Ps-atom phase shifts from the bound-state energies, as
described by Eq. (14). Hence, in the present work we have used
a new set of more ﬂexible, nonlinear ﬁts for ρ
, considering
(
each combination of Rc and J Π separately.

K

)

)

For Ps conﬁned in a spherical cavity, it is possible that ρ
(deﬁned as explained in Ref. [66]) may have some dependence
on the cavity radius Rc (for a given momentum K). Thus, if
Rc is small then the cavity wall has a large curvature, meaning
that the Ps interacts with it more strongly and is held further
from it, resulting in a large value of ρ. Conversely, if Rc is
large then the cavity wall is ﬂatter, and the Ps can approach
it more closely, resulting in a smaller ρ. There may also be
some inaccuracies in the representation of Ps close to the wall
(where the single-center expansion of the Ps wave function is
slower to converge), which can be eﬀectively absorbed into the
value of ρ
. For this reason, we have generated a separate
(
ﬁt for each combination of Rc and J Π.

K

)

The precise form of each ﬁt depends on the number of Ps
energy eigenstates (and corresponding values of ρ) available
for given Rc and J Π (see Ref. [66]); this number varies between
two and four. If only two data points are available, we resort to
a linear ﬁt

[78] Compared with the exponential knot sequence, which is con-
venient for atomic calculations, including eﬃcient convergence
of many-body-theory sums [77], the “quadratic-linear” knot se-
quence (28) ensures that the Ps states, Eq. (3), are represented
accurately both at small distances and near the cavity wall.
