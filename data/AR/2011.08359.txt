Abstract 

The  nature  and  concentration  of  defects  near  niobium-silicon  interfaces  prepared  with 
different  silicon  surface  treatments  were  characterized  using  current-voltage  (I-V),  deep  level 
transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). All samples have 
H, C, O, F, and Cl chemical contamination in the Si within 50 nm of the interface and electrically 
active  defects  with  activation  energies  of  0.147,  0.194,  0.247,  0.339,  and  0.556 eV  above  the 
valence band maximum (Evbm). In all cases, the deep level defect concentration is dominated by 
the hole trap at Evbm+0.556 eV, which we assign to a Nb point defect in Si, presumably NbSi. This 
defect is present with concentrations ranging from 7×1013 to 5×1014 cm-3 and depends on the final 
surface clean process.  

The optimum surface treatment used in this study is an HF etch followed by an in-situ 100 eV 
Ar-gas ion milling process. Higher energy ion milling is found to increase the electrically active 
Nb defect concentration in the Si, and increase the concentration of defects. The HF etch alone 
removes O from the interface, but results in significant H and F contamination, electrically-active 
point defect concentrations, and levels of Shockley-Reed-Hall recombination (i.e., Nb/Si Schottky 
diodes with an ideality factor, n, of ≈1.6). The RCA clean increases the depth and concentration 
of H, F, C, and Nb contamination.

Introduction 
Superconducting  electronic  circuits  and  systems  commonly  use  niobium  because  of  its 
relatively high superconducting transition temperature (TC=9.2 K) and relative ease in depositing 
high-quality  thin-films.  For  applications  that  require  ultra-low  noise,  including  quantum 
computing,  sensing,  and  information  systems,  undoped  zone-refined  Si  substrates  are  most 
commonly  used  because  of  their  wide  availability  and  purity.  Superconducting  coplanar 
microwave resonators are an example of a device that uses this system at sub-Kelvin temperatures 
and  single-photon  levels  to  achieve  minimal  noise.  However,  in  these  devices,  defect-induced 
microwave loss at the metal-dielectric interface is often the dominant “two-level-systems” noise 
source [1] [2] [3]. While surface engineering [4] [5] and removal of residue from microfabrication 
[6] can decrease this loss, the physical nature of the defects responsible for these losses is still 
unknown. In this investigation, we aim to identify the chemical and electrical properties of defects 
present  at  niobium-silicon  interfaces  and  identify  their  physical  nature  when  possible,  using 
characterization techniques developed by the semiconductor industry. 

In this study, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) has been used to 
measure  the  depth  profile  of  contaminants  and  the  level  of  intermixing  at  and  near  the  Nb-Si 
interface. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) are 
performed  to  determine  layer  thicknesses  and  concentrations.  Current-voltage  (I-V)  and 
capacitance-voltage (C-V) profiling techniques identify changes in doping profile, barrier heights,

the presence of Shockley-Reed-Hall recombination, an interfacial oxide layer, and surface leakage 
currents. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) further adds to these techniques, identifying 
concentrations,  energy  levels,  capture  cross-sections,  and  depth  profiles  of  defects  within  the 
depletion region, and has the ability to determine the physical nature of the electronic defect by 
comparing to known electronic levels and capture cross-sections.  

2  Experimental Parameters 

1 × 1  cm2 p-type Si with 7–8 μm epitaxial B-doped  (8×1016 cm-3)  on 500 μm B-doped 
5×1019 cm-3 substrates were used. The top epitaxial Si layer is chosen with low enough doping 
concentration to make a low-leakage Schottky junction, while the base substrate is highly doped 
to reduce series resistance. Sequential substrate cleaning procedures were performed, and then the 
specimens  were  loaded  into  the  vacuum  deposition  chamber  within  180  seconds  to  minimize 
contamination and oxidation of the surfaces.   

The “solvent only” cleaned substrates are immersed in acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 
9 minutes, then in USP-grade anhydrous undenatured ethanol for 9 minutes. The “HF etch” sample 
processing follows the solvent clean with a 5-minute immersion in HF (2 vol% aqueous), after 
which  we  shake  the  HF  off  the  sample  without  rinsing  the  surface  to  minimize  organic 
contaminants. An ion milling process using a 5 cm Kaufman ion source at 60 eV Ar ion energy, 2 
mA current for 2 minutes is then performed in-situ before the final Nb deposition for “ion mill” 
specimens. For the “RCA cleaned” specimens, we insert RCA clean “SC-1” and “SC-2” steps [7] 
before HF etch and ion milling; these consist of 10-minute immersion at 70 °C in NH4OH + H2O2 
to remove organic residue, followed by 10-minute immersion at 70 °C in HCl + H2O2 to remove 
metal contaminants and form an oxide layer. The RCA clean procedure is followed by the same 
5-minute HF etch (2 vol% aqueous) to remove the oxide layer, then a 2-minute in-situ ion milling 
process with Ar ions, 60 eV, 2 mA before Nb deposition.  

Niobium  is  deposited  via  magnetron  sputtering  in  an  un-baked  cryo-pumped  ultra-high 
vacuum (UHV) chamber with base pressure less than 2×10-9 Torr. Source to substrate distance is 
≈15 cm, with the Nb deposition rate ≈0.6 nm/second and a total film thickness of ≈200 nm. The 
device area is defined using a metal shadow mask to minimize confounding experimental effects 
such as etch damage or contamination from photolithographic processing. The device areas include 
1 × 1 mm2 squares for I-V and DLTS measurements, and a 2 mm diameter circle for the TOF-
SIMS depth profile. This sample configuration enables us to meet experimental requirements for 
both chemical and electrical characterization on the same specimen to avoid run-to-run variation. 
We prepare ohmic contacts on the back-side of the 5 × 1019 cm-3 boron-doped substrate 
immediately after removing the sample from vacuum by scratching the rough side of the film with 
a diamond scribe to break through the silicon oxide layer, then applying two pads of silver paint 
(SPI, Model Silver Conductive Paint, West Chester, PA) on an approximately 3 × 8 mm2 area. The 
silver paint is  then cured at room temperature overnight. Room-temperature  I-V measurements 
across the two back-side contacts are performed to confirm the contacts are ohmic (i.e., linear and 
non-rectifying), and the large back-side contact area is used to ensure that the device capacitance 
is limited by the size of the 1 × 1 mm2 Nb-Si Schottky barrier on the top surface.  

TOF-SIMS  depth  profiling  is  performed  with  a  Time  of  Flight  Secondary  Ion  Mass 
Spectrometer (ION-TOF USA, Inc., Chestnut Ridge, NY). Negative secondary ions are monitored 
using a 69Ga primary analysis beam and Cs sputter beam at 1 kV, in an un-baked vacuum chamber 
with base pressure less than 2×10-9 Torr. The relatively low 1 kV sputter energy minimizes beam 
intermixing and increases depth resolution; however, the low sputter rate (1.5 seconds/Å) increases

the  background  signal  from  redeposition.  TRIM  [8]  simulation  estimates  2  nm  of  intermixing 
induced  by  the  Cs  beam  at  this  energy,  ignoring  cascade  effects  from  repeated  sputtering;  we 
estimate the experimentally-realized interface resolution of about 5 nm. SIMS sensitivity factors 
are only available for bulk Si [9], and since ionization potentials and charged-particle sputter yields 
can differ by orders of  magnitude from those values  in the highly  intermixed interfacial Nb/Si 
region, all SIMS data in this volume are presented as secondary ion yield values normalized to the 
relative count rate of the host matrix (Nb or Si).  

Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) use a 
1.7 MV Tandetron accelerator (5.1 MeV maximum energy) with α-particles at 2.0 MeV (for RBS), 
3.0 MeV for oxygen NRA, and 3.58 MeV for carbon NRA. Both RBS and NRA have a sensitivity 
of ≈0.01 at% in a thick layer, and a depth resolution of ≈0.5 nm.  

In this investigation, we electrically characterize our devices using current-voltage (I-V) 
measurements  using  a  picoammeter  with  an  internal  voltage  source  (Hewlett-Packard  Model 
4140B, Palo Alto, CA), and DLTS using a Semilab time-resolved capacitance meter (DLTS Model 
DLS-83, Budapest, Hungary). DLTS measurements were performed using a 20 μs filling pulse 
time, with rate windows ranging from 25–125 Hz, reverse bias of 1 V, and forward bias of +1.1 V 
to  fill  defects  near  the  Nb/Si  interface.  A  cryogenic  cold  stage  refrigerator  with  a  50–350 K 
temperature  range  (Cryosystems  Model  LTS-21,  Westerville,  Ohio)  cools  the  specimens  for 
temperature  profiling.  For  the  DLTS  measurements,  the  diodes  are  driven  into  reverse  bias  to 
empty traps, then a forward bias pulse fills traps, and the time-dependent change in capacitance is 
measured  and  related  to  the  emission  rate  of  the  activated  traps.  We  measure  temperature 
spectrums at different rate windows (measurement frequency), generating frequency-temperature 
data for each peak  with  the intensity  corresponding to the  emission rate  and  concentration. An 
Arrhenius plot of these peak positions (T) and emission rates (τe) is fit to the equation

to  obtain  the  energy  level  from  the  band  (ET)  and  capture  cross  section  (σ)  using  the  constant 
γ=1.78×1021  cm-2s-1K-2  for  p-type  Si  [10].  After  identifying  frequency-temperature  pairs  for 
specific energy levels, we perform depth profiles by setting the temperature and frequency to a 
constant value and then apply two excitation pulses with varying periods a set time apart to define 
the width of the space charge region. When possible, we compared measured activation energies 
and capture cross-section to those in the literature, to determine the physical origin of the defect, 
keeping in mind what chemical species are present in the region as measured by the TOF-SIMS 
measurements.  

3  Results and Discussion 
3.1  Chemical characterization of interfaces 

The  TOF-SIMS  profiles  in  Figure  1  provide  high  depth  and  mass-resolved  chemical 
profiles across  the  niobium-silicon interfaces.  For  this investigation,  we focus primarily on the 
contaminants near the interface in the Si layer, since they are presumed to be responsible for the 
microwave  losses  [1].  In  all  specimens,  TOF-SIMS  identifies  interfacial  and  near-interfacial 
contamination  from  hydrogen,  carbon,  oxygen,  fluorine,  and  chlorine,  likely  remaining  from 
substrate  processing.  TOF-SIMS  reports  only  chemical  contaminants  and  does  not  distinguish 
those  that  may  be  electrically  inactive  in  Si.  However,  identifying  chemical  species  can  help

identify sources of contamination, and help identify the origin of electrical defects measured with 
DLTS. 

Because TOF-SIMS does not allow for easy quantification of interface contaminants, RBS 
and  NRA  were  used  to  set  an  upper  limit  for  interface  contamination.  In  the  “solvent  only” 
specimen,  we  observe  about  10  nm  of  SiO2  at  the  interface,  but  all  subsequent  surface  clean 
techniques remove SiO2. For all other samples, there are not any contaminants observed in the Nb 
layer or the Si substrates to within the 0.01 at% detection limit of RBS. Since RBS and NRA have 
been established to be highly accurate and do not require a standard, it sets an upper limit to the 
level of impurities that can be present in the sample. 

Figure  1  shows  TOF-SIMS  depth  profiling  near  the  Nb/Si  interfaces,  beginning  10  nm 
from the Si surface. We detect H, C, O, F, and Cl in all specimens. In the “Solvent Only” specimen 
the H concentration drops off near the interface, with a 2nd peak about 25 nm from the interface 
and reaching a minimum ≈60 nm into the Si, while the F, O, C, and Cl reach their background 
yields within 20–30 nm. After performing an HF Etch, intended to remove surface SiO2, we see a 
decrease in oxygen at the interface, as expected, but with additional C, H, and F in the silicon, 
indicating some contamination or residue from the HF clean process. Following an HF etch, the 
addition of the 60 eV in-situ ion mill (“HF & Ion Mill”) decreases interfacial H and F, with Cl and 
F peaks concentrated on the Nb-side of the interface, resulting in the least contaminated sample in 
this series. In the RCA & HF & Ion Mill specimen, the width of the Nb/Si interface broadens by 
about  5  nm,  there  is  increased  C  in  the  Si,  and  most  significantly,  there  is  a  2nd  peak  of  F 
concentration  about  20  nm  into  the  Si.  The  2nd  peak  suggests  that  the  F  is  migrating  into  the 
substrate  instead  of  passivating  a  flat  Si  surface,  either  due  to  roughness  or  reaction  with  the 
substrate.  From  these  data,  we  conclude  that  the  interface  with  the  lowest  measured  levels  of 
contamination is produced by an HF etch followed by an in-situ ion mill at 60 eV. An RCA etch 
can introduce additional contamination to the Nb/Si interface that is not removed by the HF etch 
or ion mill. 

Based on the observations that surface impurity concentrations are higher on the Nb-side 
of the interface, it is likely that some mobile contaminants on the surface preferentially accumulate 
in the Nb layer due to a gettering effect. Gettering on the metal side can be beneficial to devices 
which rely on a clean dielectric material (assuming the “dirty” metal near the interface does not 
cause a large drop in the superconducting order parameter), and has been used to remove defects 
such  as  iron  from  Si  wafers  [11].  This  effect  may  be  further  enhanced  by  annealing  or  the 
introduction of other materials such as Ta and Al [12]. In addition to gettering, the concentration 
of electrically active defects can be reduced by annealing Nb/Si structures, as many simple defects 
anneal out of silicon at temperatures between 200 and 400 °C [13]. 

3.2  Electrical characterization – I-V and DLTS 

Current-voltage characteristics of a Schottky diode are sensitive to small changes in the 
atomic structure and contamination at the interface [14], where electronically active defects can 
increase the ideality factor (n) by acting as recombination centers and altering the barrier height 
(ϕB)  by  contributing  to  interface  trapped  charge.  We  fit  the  current  in  the  forward  bias  to  the 
thermionic emission equation 

 𝐼 = 𝑆𝐴∗𝑇2𝑒−𝜙𝐵/𝑉𝑡𝑒(𝑉−𝐼𝑅)/𝑛𝑉𝑡 
where S is the area of the device, A* is the Richardson constant (8.1 A/K2cm2 for Si), T is the 
measurement temperature, ϕB is the effective barrier height, Vt the thermal voltage (kBT), R the 
series resistance, and n is the ideality factor. When n=1 the transport is described by thermionic

emission  while  n>1  corresponds  to  defect  assisted  Shockley-Reed-Hall  recombination,  surface 
leakage currents, or an interfacial oxide layer. Even in the most-ideal diodes made, the ideality 
factors fall slightly above 1, typically 1.02–1.05, as a result of barrier-lowering effects at higher 
voltages from image force and tunneling [15]. As is commonly encountered, the defect levels fall 
between the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels in forward bias, and then the Shockley, Reed, 
Hall recombination results in an ideality factor of ≈2. In the case of diodes with pinholes or surface 
conduction, the lowest barrier will dominate until the current density of the path saturates from the 
local spreading resistance, and the net current acts as multiple diodes in parallel, as discussed in 
ref [15]. Leakage from peripheral surface conduction is often linear in voltage and can be removed 
by  the  application  of  a  mesa  etch.  We  did  not  find  strong  evidence  of  such  peripheral  surface 
conduction in our devices. 

Figure 2 shows representative I-V scans of a single Nb/Si Schottky diode at temperatures 
ranging from 50-300 K. At high temperatures, series resistance dominates the device properties at 
relatively low voltages, while at low temperatures, the recombination currents dominate. For these 
reasons, we chose to focus our analysis on the I-V properties measured at 200 K.  

Figure 3  shows  I-V characteristics for  each of  the Si-surface cleaning procedures  along 
with the ideality factor and barrier height values from our fit. The data are expressed in a semi-log 
plot  to  visualize  the  slope  of  the  graph  being  inversely  proportional  to  the  ideality  factor.  An 
ideality factor of 1  corresponds to ≈60 mV  per decade. The  “most ideal” (i.e., with the lowest 
ideality factor of n=1.17) occurs in Nb/Si samples prepared with an HF etch and in-situ ion mill, 
followed by the specimen which received only an HF etch (n=1.6), while the “solvent only” and 
RCA etched samples exhibit n>2. Nb/Si samples that have undergone the RCA clean have a higher 
ideality factor than the other surface preparation methods produce. Figure 4 shows representative 
DLTS temperature spectra for the specimen cleaned with an HF etch and 60 eV ion mill, and the 
associated Arrhenius plot is in Figure 5. All specimens display similar DLTS spectra, dominated 
by a negative peak near Tpeak = 250K, followed by four additional defects at lower temperatures 
and much lower intensity. All resolved defect peaks are negative, corresponding to majority carrier 
hole traps.  

Table 1 summarizes the fitted activation energies and capture cross sections observed in 
every  specimen  with  their  possible  identifications,  while  Table  2  compares  the  defect 
concentrations  of  these  defects  between  surface  treatments.  Defect  activation  energies  will  be 
referred to by the common shorthand notation H (for hole) followed by parentheses with the energy 
above Evbm in eV. The dominant defect H(0.556) (at Tpeak=250 K)–which refers to a hole trap at 
Evbm+0.556 eV—is most likely associated with a niobium defect in p-type silicon, as reported in 
[16]. Interestingly, this defect changes activation energy and capture cross section before and after 
the addition of an HF etch. This may correspond to the presence of a nearby “spectator” defect or 
other forms of a change in environment. In the “solvent only” sample, the energy of this peak is 
EV+0.447  eV  and  its  capture  cross  section  σ=2.62×10-15  cm2,  while  all  subsequent  surface 
treatments this defect occurs at EV+0.556 eV with σ=3.72×10-13 cm2, but both activation energies 
correspond to reported energy levels for niobium in p-type silicon [16] [17]. The large ≈10-13 cm2 
capture cross section we observe for H(0.556) suggests its origin may be associated with a defect 
complex involving niobium, but present literature reports do not speculate on the exact nature of 
this defect. The H(0.194) defect matches energy levels for a silicon divacancy with a +1 charge, 
(VSi-VSi)+ [13], and also matches reported energy levels associated with F and Cl in Si [17]. The 
0 migration 
H(0.339) defect matches the energy for a thermally-activated VSi
[13],  and  is  close  to  both  the  energy  and  capture  cross  section  reported  for  a  Cs-Ci  pair  [18]. 

2+ migration, and a VSi

However, vacancies in silicon are highly mobile and expected to anneal out at temperatures above 
200 K [13], so these are unlikely to survive except if trapped by another defect. While the listed 
origins represent some possibilities, confidently determining the physical origin of energy levels 
requires further investigations.  

The ideality factor inferred from the I-V characteristics correlates reasonably well with the 
total  defect  concentration  measured  by  DLTS,  as  shown  in  Table  2.  This  is  consistent  with 
expectations from the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination theory [19] [20]; however, we are not 
aware of any prior work that has documented this important relationship in niobium-silicon diodes. 
In terms of both chemical and electrical properties, the HF etch and ion milled Si surface yields 
diodes  with  the  lowest  contamination  levels  and  best  electrical  properties  found  among  the 
different cleaning methods.  

3.3  Optimization of Ion Mill Energy 

This section compares the interfaces of Nb on p-type Si, where the Si was cleaned with an 
HF etch followed by an Ar ion mill at 60, 100, or 150 eV, with the same total ion dose. We estimate 
that ion milling at 60, 100, and 150 eV removed 0.4, 0.8, and 4 nm of Si, respectively, from the Si 
surface [21]. Higher energy incident ions are expected to remove more surface atoms, and more 
interface contamination, but with a higher probability of introducing Si vacancies, interstitials, and 
other native defects.  

Figure 6 shows TOF-SIMS depth profiles for Si cleaned with an HF etch followed by in-
situ  ion  milling  at  60,  100,  and  150  eV.  Interestingly,  we  do  not  see  any  change  in  Nb/Si 
intermixing as a result of higher ion mill energy (within the approximately 5 nm resolution for 
these sputter depth profiles). The nature and level of chemical contamination observed in the Si 
layer does not exhibit significant differences between the three samples. 

I-V measurements performed at 200 K are shown in Figure 7. Increasing the ion mill energy 
from 60 eV to 100 eV reduces the current in reverse bias by almost 2 orders of magnitude, and 
decreases  the  ideality  factor  from  n=1.17  to  n=1.07.  Increasing  the  ion  mill  energy  to  150  eV 
results in nearly the same curve as the 100 eV-cleaned specimen, with slightly improved ideality 
factor n=1.06. These results indicate that ion milling with energy greater than 100 eV can improve 
the Schottky barrier properties of the Nb/Si interface. 

Table 2 includes the defect concentrations for each activation energy determined by DLTS 
for the HF and ion milled Schottky diodes. The concentration of the dominant defect, H(0.556), is 
lowest  in  the  specimen  ion  milled  with  100  eV  Ar  ions,  approximately  half  the  concentration 
observed  in  the  60  eV  and  150  eV  ion  milled  specimens.  The  increase  in  the  concentration  of 
H(0.339) and H(0.247) with higher energy ion milling indicates that these are ion-induced defects. 
The  100  eV  ion  milled  specimen  has  the  lowest  total  deep  level  defect  concentration  of  any 
measurements, with N<1014 cm-3. These data confirm that surface cleaning procedures must be 
optimized  to  minimize  the  total  defect  concentration  near  the  interface  without  introducing 
additional defects from substrate cleaning processes. 

DLTS was used to perform depth profiles of electrically active defects, shown in Figure 8. 
Using DLTS depth profiling techniques, we can probe within ≈10 nm of the interface. We find 
that the majority of defects are concentrated within the first 50 nm from the interface, matching 
the  range  of  interface  contamination  observed  with  TOF-SIMS.  The  defects  H(0.147)  and 
H(0.339) have nearly constant concentration across the measurement range. Two defects, H(0.247) 
and  H(0.556),  exhibit  a  second  peak  in  concentration  at  approximately  210  and  240  nm  deep,

respectively. This deep accumulation near the edge of the depletion region suggests that these are 
mobile defects and have some charge that drives them into the substrate.  

4  Conclusions 

We  have  used  TOF-SIMS,  I-V,  and  DLTS  techniques  to  compare  the  chemical  and 
electrical properties of defects at the Nb-Si interface. We identify chemical contamination at the 
interface from H, C, O, F, and Cl, within the top 50 nm, and deep level defects at Evbm+0.147, 
Evbm+0.194, Evbm+0.247, Evbm+0.339, and Evbm+0.556 eV. Based on DLTS depth profiling, most 
electronic  defects  are  within  the  50  nm  closest  to  the  Nb/Si  interface,  with  the  defects  at 
Evbm+0.556  eV  and  Evbm+0.247  exhibiting  a  second,  albeit  much  lower  concentration,  peak  of 
charged defects 200–250 nm deep. Comparing different surface preparation techniques shows a 
minimum total defect concentration when the Si surface is cleaned with an HF etch and a 100 eV 
in-situ Ar ion mill. More aggressive chemical surface treatments (RCA clean) and higher energy 
ion milling (i.e., Ar at 150 eV) result in significantly more defects at the interface.

Figure 4: Representative DLTS spectra performed at 25, 75, and 125 Hz for a Nb/Si diode 
prepared with HF etch and 60 eV ion mill. The spectra are dominated by the peak identified as 
H(0.556) (right), attributed to a Nb defect [16] [17].

Figure 5: Representative Arrhenius plot of the DLTS peaks for the diode prepared with a HF and 
60 eV ion milled surface clean measured with rate windows 25, 35, 45, 55, 75, 125, and 400 Hz. 
Each point corresponds to the temperature and emission rate of a peak measured in DLTS-
temperature spectra at different frequencies. Linear least-mean-square error fits are drawn 
through points corresponding to the same peak measured at different frequencies. The slope of 
each line corresponds to the energy level of the trap, and the capture cross section is inferred 
from the y-intercept.

Figure 7: I-V measurements performed at 200 K comparing Nb/Si structures prepared with an 
HF etch followed by an in-situ Ar ion mill, with varying mill energies. Curves are labeled with 
the energy of incident Ar ions and their corresponding ideality factor and barrier height. They 
are: “Ar=60 eV” (n=1.17, ϕB=0.45 eV), “Ar=100 eV” (n=1.07, ϕB=0.50 eV), and “Ar=150 eV” 
(n=1.06, ϕB=0.50 eV).

Figure 8: Representative defect depth profiles for HF etched and 150 eV ion milled specimen. 
Defects are primarily concentrated at the interface, within the first 50 nm, while the DLTS 
measurements of defects H(0.556) and H(0.247) have a second peak between 200 and 250 nm.

Table 1: Average defect energy levels, their capture cross sections, temperatures, and potential 
defect identifications. All defects measured are majority carriers (hole traps). The assignment of 
possible origins comes from using both the information on the potential species in the area 
obtained from the SIMS measurements and from comparing energy level and capture cross 
section to the literature. Reported capture cross sections are calculated from Arrhenius plots, and 
may have large error.
