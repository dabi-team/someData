Abstract 

High resolution spectra of (CO2)2-Rg trimers (Rg = Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) in the region of 

the CO2 3 fundamental (2350 cm-1) are reported, using a tunable OPO laser source to probe a 

pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion. These (CO2)2-Rg transitions tend to be hidden among 

stronger spectra due to other species, such as CO2-Rg and (CO2)2. Each trimer consists of a 

(CO2)2 unit which is similar to the free carbon dioxide dimer (planar parallel staggered) plus an 

Rg atom located out-of-plane on the dimer C2 symmetry axis, but the (CO2)2 unit may not remain 

exactly planar in the dimer. Experimental structures show that the C-Rg bond lengths in the 

trimers are similar to those in the corresponding CO2-Rg dimers. As well, the vibrational band 

origin shifts, relative to (CO2)2 itself, are similar to those of CO2-Rg relative to CO2.

1.  Introduction 

Weakly bound dimers composed of a carbon dioxide molecule and a rare gas atom have 

been extensively studied by high resolution spectroscopy. In addition, the trimer CO2-Ar2 is 

known, and other CO2-(Rg)n clusters are being studied in our lab. Here, we report on another 

family of trimers, namely those containing two CO2 molecules and one rare gas atom. The 

present work was inspired by our recent studies of the related trimers (CO2)2-CO and (CO2)2-

N2,1,2 whose structures can be described as resembling a CO2 dimer (near planar, staggered) with 

the CO or N2 aligned along the CO2 dimer C2 symmetry axis. Not surprisingly, it turns out that 

(CO2)2-Rg trimers have similar structures with the Rg atom located on the symmetry axis, as 

shown in Fig. 1. 

High resolution infrared3-15 and microwave11,16-20 spectroscopy of CO2-Rg dimers has 

revealed basic characteristics which are relevant for the trimers studied here. These include the 

intermolecular separations (C-Rg bond lengths) which are approximately (3.29, 3.50, 3.62, 3.81 

Å) for the series (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), as well as the vibrational frequency shifts (relative to the free 

CO2 molecule) for the CO2 3 band which are (+0.130, -0.470, -0.884, -1.471 cm-1). These dimer 

parameters are helpful for estimating expected structures and band origins for the (CO2)2-Rg 

trimers. Also relevant here is the spectrum of the (CO2)2 dimer,21-26 which has two fundamental 

vibrations arising from the CO2 monomer 3 (asymmetric stretch) mode. Because of the C2h 

symmetry of the dimer, one of these modes is infrared-inactive while the other active one is 

responsible for the known (CO2)2 3 region fundamental band, centered at 2350.771 cm-1. This 

latter band corresponds closely to the (CO2)2-Rg spectra reported here.

parallel staggered) with the Rg located on the C2 symmetry axis at a distance of 2.9 to 3.5 Å from the dimer center 
of mass. 

2.  Results 

The spectra were recorded as described previously,9,27 using a pulsed supersonic slit jet 

expansion probed by a rapid-scan optical parametric oscillator source. A typical gas expansion 

mixture contained about 0.04% CO2 plus 0.5 to 1.0% Ne, Ar, Kr, or Xe in helium carrier gas 

with a backing pressure of about 13 atmospheres. Wavenumber calibration was carried out by 

simultaneously recording signals from a fixed etalon and a reference gas cell containing room 

temperature CO2. Spectral simulation and fitting were made using the PGOPHER software.28  

It turns out that the C2 symmetry axis which runs through the Rg atom in (CO2)2-Rg 

trimers (see Fig. 1) coincides with the b-inertial axis for Ne and Ar, but the a-axis for Kr and Xe. 

This has consequences for the rotational selection rules in our observed spectra, as well as 

nuclear spin statistics (arising from equivalent CO2 molecules and zero nuclear spins for 12C and 

16O). As a result, (CO2)2-Ne and -Ar have a- and c-type transitions and allowed ground state 

rotational levels with (Ka, Kc) = (even, even) and (odd, odd), while (CO2)2-Kr and -Xe have b- 

and c-type transitions and allowed ground state levels with (Ka, Kc) = (even, even) and (even, 

 
  4 

odd). Here the c-type transitions are somewhat stronger, with the a- or b-type ones being roughly 

20% weaker, as in the case of (CO2)2. 

The (CO2)2-Rg spectra are difficult to observe because they tend to be obscured among 

stronger transitions due to CO2-Rg dimers (including CO2-He, from the He carrier gas), CO2 

monomers, (CO2)2 dimers, and other larger clusters. This probably explains why they have not 

been reported previously. But we were encouraged by our previous detection1 of the analogous 

(CO2)2-CO trimer, and by the fact that it was straightforward to estimate the (CO2)2-Rg 

structures (and hence rotational parameters) with reasonable accuracy. The strongest and most 

obvious feature in the (CO2)2-Rg spectra is a central Q-branch peak. Figure 2 shows the example 

of (CO2)2-Xe, for which this Q-branch appears at 2349.24 cm-1 in a relatively uncrowded region 

of the spectrum. It is evident that all the other spectral peaks of (CO2)2-Xe, in the P- and R-

branch regions, are much weaker than the Q-branch.

(CO2)2-Xe spectrum is the Q-branch at 2349.24 cm-1. Lines marked with an asterisk are due to CO2-He.

The pattern of the present (CO2)2-Rg spectra is illustrated in Fig. 3 by simulated spectra, 

and the parameters resulting from fits to the spectra are listed in Table 1. The most difficult case 

was that of (CO2)2-Kr, in part because its Q-branch happens to be obscured by CO2 monomer 

absorption (R(0) of the fundamental band). This is reflected in larger standard deviations for the 

(CO2)2-Kr parameters in Table 1. A notable feature of these parameters is that the B-values of 

(CO2)2-Ne and -Ar and the A-values of (CO2)2-Kr and -Xe are nearly equal to each other 

(0.0463 cm-1) and in turn very similar to the C-value of (CO2)2 itself (0.0453 cm-1). This is just 

what we expect from the fact that the (CO2)2-Rg trimers resemble (CO2)2 with an Rg atom added 

on the symmetry axis. 

In the case of both (CO2)2-CO and -N2, we observed two fundamental bands in the CO2 

3 region, a stronger (a,c)-type band corresponding to the (CO2)2-Rg bands reported here, and a 

weak b-type band.2 Detection of the weak band confirmed that the (CO2)2 dimer subunits in 

(CO2)2-CO and -N2 are not planar, and calculations indicated that each CO2 unit departs from 

planarity by about 19°. We searched for the analogous second fundamentals for (CO2)2-Rg, but 

were not able to observe them. This does not prove exact planarity, but it probably indicates that 

the (CO2)2 dimer subunits are more nearly planar for (CO2)2-Rg than for (CO2)2-CO and -N2.

3.  Discussion and conclusions 

3.1. Structures 

Assuming C2 symmetry, four structural parameters are required to specify the structure of 

a (CO2)2-Rg trimer. These can be specified as: R1 (center of mass (c.m.) separation of Rg and 

(CO2)2 subunits); R2 (c.m. separation of CO2 subunits, that is, C-C distance);  (angle between a 

line connecting the C atoms of the CO2 units and an OCO axis); and  (departure from planarity 

of (CO2)2 subunit).  But we only have three rotational constants for each trimer, and so cannot 

determine unique experimental structures. In order to obtain structures here, we assume  = 0 

(planar (CO2)2 subunit) and this yields the structural parameters listed in Table 2 (note that those 

for (CO2)2-Kr are probably less reliable than the others, as mentioned above). For comparison, 

analogous parameters for (CO2)2 and CO2-Rg dimers are included. The values of R2 (3.55 – 3.60 

Å) and  (56 - 59°) are similar for all the (CO2)2-Rg trimers and for (CO2)2. It appears that the 

presence of the nearby Rg atom causes the CO2 monomers to move slightly closer together. The 

values of R1 naturally increase with the Rg mass, as do the resulting values of R(C-Rg) which are 

similar to those of the corresponding CO2-Rg dimers.

3.2. Vibrational shifts 

The shifts of the (CO2)2-Rg band origins with respect to that of (CO2)2 are listed in Table 3. 

There is a systematic trend from a small blue shift for (CO2)2-Ne to a much larger red shift 

for (CO2)2-Xe. Interestingly, this trend is remarkably similar to that determined previously 

for CO2-Rg dimers,25 as illustrated in two ways in Fig. 4. The lower panel in Fig. 4 also 

shows how both the dimer and trimer shifts have an almost linear dependence on the 

polarizability of the rare gas atom. The relatively small differences between the dimer and 

trimer shifts may be of theoretical interest for future modeling of potential surfaces and 

nonadditive three body effects.

with (CO2)2-Rg trimers relative to (CO2)2 dimer. Lower panel: dependence of the vibrational shifts of CO2-Rg

3.3. Conclusions 

It would be very interesting to observe the remaining trimer in the present family, (CO2)2-

He, but so far we have not been able to find it. Also interesting would be the tetramers (CO2)2-

(Rg)2. Would their structures involve Rg atoms on the symmetry axis on either side of the 

(CO2)2, or would the Rg atoms locate on one side, forming an (Rg)2 dimer? This could change, 

depending on the Rg atom. Mixed tetramers involving two different Rg atoms are also possible.  

Another avenue for future investigation involves combination bands of the present 

trimers involving excitation of the CO2 3 mode plus a low frequency intermolecular mode. Such 

bands have already been observed2 for both (CO2)2-CO and -N2. They are relatively weak, but 

have the advantage of being more likely to appear in spectral regions with less interference from 

other species. 

In conclusion, weakly-bound trimers of the form (CO2)2-Rg (Rg = Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) have 

been observed by high-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the region of the CO2 3 fundamental 

band (2350 cm-1). Their structures resemble the carbon dioxide dimer, (CO2)2 (near planar, 

side-by-side staggered) with an Rg atom located on its out-of-plane C2 symmetry axis. 

Experimental structures derived from the observed rotational constants (assuming planarity for 

the (CO2)2), confirm the similarity of the (CO2)2 unit in the trimers to the carbon dioxide dimer 

and give C-Rg distances similar to those in the corresponding CO2-Rg dimers. Vibrational shifts 

of the (CO2)2-Rg trimer band origins relative to (CO2)2 are found to be remarkably similar to 

those of CO2-Rg dimers relative to CO2.
