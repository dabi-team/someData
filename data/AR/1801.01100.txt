Abstract 

Hypervelocity  impacts  cause  significant  heating  of  planetary  bodies.  Such  events  are 
recorded  by  a  reset  of  40Ar–36Ar  ages  and/or  impact  melts.  Here,  we  investigate  the 

influence of friction and plastic deformation in shock-generated comminuted rocks on 

the degree of impact heating using the iSALE shock-physics code. We demonstrate that 

conversion  from  kinetic  to  internal  energy  in  the  targets  with  strength  occurs  during 

pressure  release,  and  additional  heating  becomes  significant  for  low-velocity  impacts 
(<10  km  s–1).  This  additional  heat  reduces  the  impact-velocity  thresholds  required  to 

heat the targets with the 0.1 projectile mass to temperatures for the onset of Ar loss and 
melting from 8 and 10 km s–1, respectively, for strengthless rocks to 2 and 6 km s–1 for 

typical  rocks.  Our  results  suggest  that  the  impact  conditions  required  to  produce  the 

unique  features  caused  by  impact  heating  span  a  much  wider  range  than  previously 

thought.

1. Introduction 

Collisions  between  two  planetary  bodies  at  speeds  of  several  km  s–1  cause 

significant heating of their surface materials (e.g., Ahrens and O’Keefe, 1972), resulting 

in the generation of impact melts, which are among the most curious geological samples 

known  (e.g.,  Grieve  and  Cintala,  1992).  Since  the  degree  of  impact  heating  depends 

strongly on the impact velocity, detailed geochemical analyses of such heated samples 

allow us to characterize the impact environment in the solar system through its history. 

A  recently  proposed  dynamical  model  of  the  early  solar  system  predicts  large-scale 

orbital  migration  of  gas  giants  (e.g.,  Gomes  et  al.,  2005),  suggesting  that  the 

impact-velocity  distributions  on  planetary  bodies  such  as  asteroids  are  significantly 

disturbed  at  the  time  of  migration  (e.g.,  Bottke  et  al.,  2012).  Such  changes  in  the 

impact-velocity  distribution  might  be  recorded  by  the  abundance  of  impact  melts  as  a 

function of time (e.g., Marchi et al., 2013). 

Understanding  the  impact  velocities  required  for  incipient  and  complete 

melting  is  essential  to  extract  information  about  the  impact-velocity  distribution  on 

planetary  bodies.  Ahrens  and  O’Keefe  (1972)  proposed  that  the  entropy  matching 

method  could  be  used  to  quantify  the  velocity  thresholds  for  incipient  and  complete 

melting  by  assuming  that  the  shocked  matter  expands  adiabatically  to  the  reference 

volume;  i.e.,  dS  =  0,  where  S  is  the  specific  entropy.  It  is  widely  believed  that  this 

assumption  is  valid  for  impacts  at  relatively  high  velocities,  because  the  strongly 

shocked matter would behave as a perfect fluid, and high thermal pressure leads to rapid 

adiabatic  expansion.  An  advantage  of  the  use  of  this  method  is  that  we  only  need  to 

know the entropy in the peak-shock and reference states: we do not need to know the 

time dependence of thermodynamic quantities in phase space during pressure release. 

This method has been widely used to obtain the peak pressure required for 

the incipient melting of various geological materials (e.g., Ahrens and O’Keefe, 1972; 

Pierazzo et al., 1997; Pierazzo et al., 2005; Stewart et al., 2008; Hamann et al., 2016). 

The corresponding impact velocities for the onset of melting can be estimated using the 

one-dimensional  impedance  matching  method  (e.g.,  Ahrens  and  O’Keefe,  1972).  For 
example,  the  estimated  velocity  thresholds  for  granite  and  basalt  are  5.1  km  s–1  (46 
GPa) and 7.6 km s–1 (96 GPa), respectively. Note that these estimates are based on the 
assumption of head-on collisions between objects composed of the same material. 

Quintana et al. (2015) carried out two-dimensional impact simulations using 

2  

  
the  CTH  code  and  reported  that  the  material  strength  leads  to  a  higher  degree  of 

shock-induced  melting  than  the  purely  hydrodynamic  (i.e.,  no  material  strength)  case 
when  the  impact  velocity  is  relatively  low  (<10  km  s–1).  Kenkmann  et  al.  (2013) 

reported 

the  results  of 

impact  experiments  under  MEMIN  (Multidisciplinary 

Experimental  and  Modeling  Impact  Research  Network;  Kenkmann  et  al.,  2011);  i.e., 

that the partial melting of iron meteorites, which are launched as projectiles, occurs at a 

much  lower  peak  pressure  (55  GPa)  than  the  peak  pressure  estimated  for  incipient 

melting of iron predicted by the entropy-matching method (162 GPa). Such unexpected 

additional heating has not been recognized in laboratory experiments, possibly because 

the  amount  of  permissible  strain  in  uniaxial  (one-dimensional)  shock–recovery 

experiments is highly limited with respect to the three-dimensional deformation during 

natural impacts. 

  This changes the velocity thresholds for impact melting to somewhat lower 

values  than  previously  thought.  Although  Quintana  et  al.  (2015)  did  not  clearly  show 

how the material strength enhances impact melting and which physical parameters are 

important  in  the  material  strength  model,  their  new  insights  could  have  a  significant 

influence on decoding impact histories based on the occurrence of impact melts. 

In this study, we address how material strength affects the degree of impact 

heating using the iSALE code (Amsden et al., 1980; Ivanov et al., 1997; Collins et al., 

2004; Wünnemann et al., 2006), which has been widely distributed to academic users in 

the  impact  community.  We  consider  a  simple,  well-established  constitutive  model  to 

address  the  energy  partitioning  from  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  impactor  to  the  internal 

energy of both projectile and target. In particular, we focus on the influence of strength 

in the shock-comminuted damaged rocks on the degree of shock heating. 

2. Methods 

We  used  the  two-dimensional  model  included  in  the  iSALE  shock-physics 

code, known as the iSALE–Dellen model (Collins et al., 2016). The strength model for 

rocks  (Ivanov  et  al.,  1997;  Collins  et  al.,  2004)  and  the  ANalytical  Equation  Of  State 

(ANEOS; Thompson and Lauson, 1972) for dunite (Benz et al., 1989) were applied to 

both projectile and target. This EOS model is commonly used to approximate the bulk 

properties of chondritic materials (e.g., Johnson et al., 2015). 

In the strength model, the yield strength is given by 

3  

  
 
Y = (1–D)Yi + DYd,   

(1) 

where Yi and Yd are the yield strengths of intact and shock-comminuted damaged rock, 

respectively.  A  damage  parameter,  D,  is  introduced,  which  expresses  the  reduction  in 

strength with increasing plastic strain, varying between D = 0 (intact rocks) and D = 1 

(shock-comminuted  damaged  rock).  Since  the  unconfined  crushing  strength  of  intact 

rocks  (1–5  GPa)  is  much  lower  than  the  shock  compression  under  typical  impact 

conditions (higher than a few km/s), the damage parameter D reaches unity immediately 

upon shock-wave arrival near the impact point. Therefore, the additional heating caused 

by Yi is not significant (see also Section 3). Thus, here we focus on the effects of Yd on 

additional  heating.  The  yield  strength  Yd  is  well  established  and  is  known  as  the 

Coulomb friction law, 

Yd = Ycoh+µdamP,   

(2) 

where  Ycoh,  µdam,  and  P  are  the  cohesion,  internal  friction  and  temporal  pressure, 
respectively.  The  yield  strength  Yd  is  limited  by  the  von  Mises  plastic  limit,  which  is 

typically  1–5  GPa  under  strong  compression.  A  detailed  description  of 

the 

pressure-dependent  yield  strength  used  in  this  study  is  presented  in  Supporting 

Information  S1.  Since  the  additional  heating  caused  by  Ycoh  is  not  significant  (see 

Section 3), µdam was treated as a free parameter so as to systematically investigate the 
effects  of  Yd  on  additional  heating.  We  varied  µdam  from  10–4  to  0.6.  The  maximum 

value of µdam is typical for rocky granular media (e.g., Collins et al., 2004). 

A  thermal  softening  model  (Ohnaka,  1995)  was  implemented  to  reproduce 

the strength behavior as a function of temperature. The yield strength decreases to zero 

at  the  melting  temperature.  The  input  parameters  for  the  strength  model  are  listed  in 

Supporting Information Table S1. 

Gravity  was  not  considered  in  our  calculations  because  gravitational 

acceleration  is  expected  to  be  negligible  in  the  early  stages  of  impact-induced 

hydrodynamic motion. A uniform temperature of 220 K was assumed for both projectile 

and  target,  which  corresponds  to  the  typical  equilibrium  temperature  in  the  main 

asteroid belt. We only modeled vertical impacts of spherical projectiles onto flat targets, 

using  cylindrical  coordinates.  We  divided  a  spherical  projectile  into  50  cells  per 
projectile  radius  (CPPR).  The  impact  velocity,  vimp,  was  varied  from  1  to  20  km  s–1. 

4  

  
 
 
 
Although the projectile radius, Rp, was set at 25 km, we can convert the results to any 

impactor  size,  because  all  hydrodynamic  equations  can  be  rewritten  in  dimensionless 

form  in  the  absence  of  gravity  and  for  scale-independent  strengths  (e.g.,  Johnson  and 

Melosh, 2013). The target was defined as a cylinder with a radius of 24 Rp. We followed 

the  simulations  until  a  time  t  =  19ts,  where  t  and  ts  are  the  time  after  initial  contact 

between projectile and target, and the characteristic time for projectile penetration (ts = 

2Rp/vimp), respectively. The end time corresponds to the initial phase of the excavation 

stage,  when  most  of  the  projectile’s  kinetic  energy  has  already  been  transferred  to  the 

target (e.g., O’Keefe and Ahrens, 1982). 

Lagrangian  tracer  particles  were  inserted  into  each  computational  cell  to 

track  the  thermal  history  of  each  particle.  We  stored  the  temporal  variations  in  the 

spatial  position,  pressure,  and  absolute  entropy  of  each  tracer  particle.  Entropy  is  a 

better  indicator  of  the  energy  partitioning  into  internal  degrees  of  freedom  than 

temperature  (e.g.,  Melosh,  2007).  The  iSALE  model  set-up  is  summarized  in 

Supporting  Information  Table  S2.  For  comparison,  we  also  conducted  simulations 

without  the  strength  model;  i.e.,  purely  hydrodynamic  simulations.  The  results  were 

analyzed using a post-analysis script, which was essentially the same as that employed 

in previous studies (Nagaki et al., 2016; Kurosawa et al., 2018). 

Figure  1  shows  the  Hugoniot  curve  for  dunite  employed  here  in  the 

entropy–pressure plane. The entropies for incipient (Sim) and complete melting (Scm), as 
well as that for the reset of the  40Ar–36Ar age (SAr), are shown as vertical dotted lines. 
Since  the  temperatures  for  such  events  at  a  pressure  of  105  Pa  have  already  been 

reported in the literature, we can determine the entropies using the ANEOS. We adopted 
SAr  =  1.99  kJ  K–1  kg–1,  which  corresponds  to  a  temperature  of  1000  K  at  105  Pa,  as 
required for rapid Ar loss (Marchi et al., 2013). We also adopted Sim = 2.35 kJ K–1 kg–1 
and  Scm  =  3.31  kJ  K–1  kg–1,  which  correspond  to  the  solidus  of  typical  chondritic 
materials (1373 K at 105 Pa; e.g., Keil et al., 1997) and the liquidus for forsterite, which 

is the dominant mineral in dunite (2173 K at 105 Pa; e.g., Ahrens and O’Keefe, 1972), 

respectively. The estimated velocity thresholds for Ar loss and incipient and complete 

melting are respectively 6.1 km s–1 (91 GPa), 6.7 km s–1 (105 GPa), and 9.0 km s–1 (168 

GPa) based on the entropy matching method for head-on collisions between two dunite 

bodies.

(S–P) plane. This curve was obtained using the ANEOS package. The colors reflect the 

corresponding impact velocities, calculated as the two-fold particle velocity behind the 

shock  wave.  The  entropies  required  for  rapid  Ar  diffusion,  incipient  melting,  and 

complete melting are shown as the three vertical dashed lines.   

We  investigated  the  mass  experiencing  Ar  loss,  MAr,  as  well  as  the  melting 

mass, Mmelt. Note that we only analyzed MAr and Mmelt for the target material. MAr was 

calculated  as  the  sum  of  the  tracer  mass  m  for  S  >  SAr;  Mmelt was  calculated  using  the 

lever rule, which depends on S of each tracer particle, as follows: 

Mmelt = Mmelt1 + Mmelt2 + Mmelt3,   (3) 

where 

Mmelt1	  =	  S S–Sim
Scm–Sim

m  Sim<	  S <	  Scm , 

Mmelt2	  =	  Sm  Scm<	  S <	  Siv , and

and complete vaporization of forsterite, respectively (Ahrens and O’Keefe, 1972). 

Technically speaking, the entropy raised by shock heating tends to slightly 

decrease  during  pressure  release  in  grid-based  hydrocodes,  possibly  because  of 

numerical  diffusion.  Thus,  we  used  the  maximum  entropy  stored  in  each  tracer  to 

calculate MAr and Mmelt in both cases, with and without material strength, to extract the 

degree of entropy enhancement during pressure release, depending on µdam. 

3. Results 

Figure  2a  and  2b  shows  snapshots  from  iSALE  simulations  for  vertical 

impacts  at  6  km  s–1  and  t  =  3  ts  without  strength  and  for µdam  =  0.6,  respectively.  All 
tracers  are  colored,  depending  on  their  temporal  entropy.  The  trajectories  of  five 

selected tracers initially located at r = 0.76 Rp (where r is the horizontal distance from 

the  impact  point)  are  also  shown  for  reference.  Although  the  shapes  of  the  transient 

cavities are similar, the temporal entropies for µdam = 0.6 are much higher than those in 

the hydrodynamic case, thus showing that the additional heating reported by Quintana et 

al. (2015) is reproduced by our numerical model. 

Figure  2c  and  2d  shows  temporal  variations  in  entropy  in  the  entropy–

pressure (S–P) plane for the iSALE runs shown in Figs 2a and 2b, respectively. Only the 

S–P histories of the tracers initially located at r = 0.76 Rp are plotted. The data points 

are colored depending on the tracers’ peak pressure. The S–P tracks of the five selected 

tracers  in  Fig.  2a  and  2b  are  also  shown  (black  symbols).  We  found  that  the  entropy 

gradually increases during pressure release in the case of µdam = 0.6 as shown in Fig. 2d. 
Most of the entropy increase occurs until the pressure decreases to 3 GPa. Some of the 
tracers  eventually  exceed  SAr  and  Sim,  even  though  the  impact  velocity  at  6  km  s–1  is 
lower  than  the  velocity  thresholds  obtained  from  the  entropy  matching  method.  In 

contrast, Fig. 2c shows the entropy is mostly preserved during pressure release when we 

did not implement the strength model. Note that the peak pressures of the tracers in Fig. 

2d deviate from the Hugoniot curve, because here we plot the ‘mean pressure,’ not the 

longitudinal stress of elastoplastic media, for which the Hugoniot relations hold strictly. 

The mean pressure is always less than the longitudinal stress by a factor that depends on 

the Poisson ratio. In contrast, Fig. 2c shows that the tracers mostly follow the Hugoniot 

curve  immediately  after  the  shock  wave’s  arrival  in  the  hydrodynamic  case.  These 

results  indicate  that  iSALE  reproduces  the  hydrodynamic  and  elastoplastic  behaviors 

7  

  
 
accurately.  Figure  3a  and  3b  shows  MAr  and  Mmelt  as  functions  of  internal  friction  and 
impact velocity, respectively. We found that MAr and Mmelt increase significantly beyond 
µdam = 10–2 at relatively low vimp. On the other hand, if µdam < 10–2, regardless of µdam, 

MAr  and  Mmelt  are  nearly  constant  and  similar  to  the  equivalent  masses  in  the  purely 

hydrodynamic case. This means that any additional heating caused by Yi and Ycoh in Eqs. 

(1) and (2) is not significant. The rates of increase in MAr and Mmelt seems to decrease for 

µdam > 0.1, suggesting that the effect of friction on the additional heating becomes less 

significant.  Plastic  deformation  versus  the  limiting  strength  plays  a  major  role  on  the 

additional  heating  for  µdam  >  0.1  (See  also  Supporting  information  S1).  The  µdam 

dependence on MAr and Mmelt also tends to reduce as vimp increases, as thermal softening 

occurs  at  high  vimp.  This  finding  is  also  consistent  with  the  results  of  Quintana  et  al. 

(2015). Although we only modeled vertical impacts, we can approximately estimate the 

masses for oblique impacts because the degree of shock heating correlates well with the 

normal component of the impact velocity (Pierazzo and Melosh, 2000). The converted 

impact  velocities,  at  a  45°  angle  measured  from  the  tangent  plane,  are  indicated  in 

parentheses next to the color bar in the figure. 

Next, we discuss the threshold pertaining to the impact velocities for Ar loss 

and  incipient  melting,  vAr  and  vmelt,  respectively.  If  we  define  the  velocity  thresholds 

when MAr and Mmelt exceed 1 wt% of the projectile mass, the resulting thresholds in the 
hydrodynamic  case  are  6  and  8  km  s–1,  respectively.  These  values  are  close  to  the 

prediction of the entropy-matching method mentioned in Section 2. In the case for µdam 
= 0.6, vAr and vmelt largely decrease to 1.5 and 4 km s–1, respectively. 

Here  as  a  conservative  estimate,  we  also  estimated  the  velocities  when  MAr 
and Mmelt exceed 10 wt% of the projectile mass as the velocity thresholds in this study. 

This  is  because  local  energy  concentrations  owing  to  a  few  processes,  such  as  jetting 

(e.g.,  Kieffer,  1977;  Sugita  and  Schultz,  1999;  Johnson  et  al.,  2015;  Kurosawa  et  al. 

2015)  and  shear  banding  (Kondo  and  Ahrens,  1983),  are  expected  to  become  more 

important  than  the  bulk  shock  heating  considered  here  when  we  deal  with  a  small 

fraction of the heated mass. In addition, numerical simulations often cause overshooting 

of  the  temperature  over  a  range  of  3–10  cells  near  the  contact  boundary  between  a 

moving  projectile  and  a  target.  The  mass  under  such  artificial  overheated  conditions 

would reach 1‒10 wt% of the projectile. When we adopt 10 wt% of the projectile mass 

for the incipient melting condition, the estimated velocity thresholds vAr and vmelt are 8 

8  

  
 
and 10 km s–1, respectively, for the purely hydrodynamic model. For µdam = 0.6, vAr and 
vmelt show significant decrease to 2 and 6 km s–1, respectively. 

We  also  investigated  the  effects  of  varying  the  spatial  resolution  on  the 

heated  mass  (Supporting  Information  S3).  We  confirmed  that  the  results  converge  to 

nearly the same value in the CPPR range from 25 to 200.

velocities.  Values  in  parentheses  indicate  the  impact  velocities  for  oblique  impacts  at

4. Discussion 

Here,  we  discuss  the  reasons  why  the  additional  heating  is  obvious  when 

µdam  >  10–2.  The  energy  required  to  move  materials  supported  by  strength,  herein 

referred to as the ‘specific strength energy,’ estrength, is approximately expressed as   

estrength = eYd/r [J kg–1],  

(7) 

where r ~ 3000 kg m–3 and e are the density and volumetric strain, respectively. This 

energy corresponds to the energy converted from kinetic to internal energy in damaged 

rocks  under  a  given  pressure  P.  Strictly  speaking,  estrength  should  be  an  integral  of  the 

stress times the strain over time. Here, we assumed that strain is a constant and is equal 

to  unity  for  an  order-of-magnitude  estimate.  The  expected  rise  in  temperature,  DT,  is 

approximately expressed as 

10  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
ΔT = estrength/Cp [K],   

(8) 

where Cp ~ 1000 J K–1 kg–1 is the isobaric specific heat. Figure 4 shows DT as a function 

of both µdam and P. We used Eq. (S2) in Supporting Information S1 here. If we focus on 
pressures P around 10 GPa (the typical peak pressure for an impact at several km s–1 is 

~100 GPa), where a large entropy increase is observed in the simulation (see Fig. 2d), 
DT  exceeds  100  K  for µdam  >  10–2.  For  typical  rocks  (µdam  =  0.6),  DT  ~  1000  K.  The 
change in entropy, DS, is approximately expressed as   

ΔS = Cp ln(1 + ΔT/Tbefore)	    [J K–1 kg–1],   

(9) 

where  Tbefore  is  the  temporal  temperature  before  heating  occurs.  If  we  consider  the 
situation for ΔT = 1000 K and Tbefore = 1200 K, ΔS is approximately 1 kJ K–1 kg–1. This 

order-of-magnitude estimate is fully consistent with the calculation results (Fig. 2). 

It is necessary to assess the consistency in energy partitioning. The kinetic 

energy in the damaged materials should be converted into internal energy to explain the 

additional  heating.  We  confirmed  that  the  kinetic  energy  lost  owing  to  the  material 

strength  accounts  for  the  additional  heating  during  pressure  release  by  examining  the 

kinetic energy carried away by the ejecta (Supporting information S4).

rocks,  µdam,  and  temporal  pressure,  P.  Three  isolines  for  100,  300,  and  1000  K  are 

shown.

We  have  demonstrated  that  the  impact-induced  reset  of  the  40Ar–36Ar  age 

and  melting  are  much  easier  to  achieve  than  previously  thought,  owing  to  energy 

conversion  from  kinetic  to  internal  energy  in  impact-comminuted  damaged  rocks.  We 

used  a  different  numerical  code  to  that  employed  in  previous  studies,  and  the  results 

strongly  indicate  that  the  additional  heating  reported  by  Quintana  et  al.  (2015)  is 

physically  real.  The  velocity  thresholds  for  various  geological  materials,  as  obtained 

from application of the entropy matching method in previous studies, would need to be 

significantly  revised  compared  with  those  based  on  using  shock-physics  codes 

combined  with  constitutive  models.  In  addition,  our  results  imply  that  the  choice  and 

accuracy of constitutive models included in shock-physics codes have a marked effect 

on the degree of shock heating in numerical models. 

5. Conclusions 

We  investigated  the  effects  of  material  strength  on  the  degree  of  impact 

heating  using  analytical  and  numerical  approaches.  We  numerically  investigated  the 

influence  of  internal  friction  in  damaged  rocks,  µdam,  on  the  degree  of  impact-induced 
heating  for  vertical  impacts  at  1–20  km  s–1.  The  additional  heating  during  pressure 
release in targets with strength becomes obvious for µdam > 10–2, which agrees well with 
simple  analytical  considerations.  Our  numerical  results  demonstrate  that  the  impact 

velocity required for the reset of 40Ar–36Ar ages and incipient melting of the target with 

the mass of 10 wt% of the projectile mass is reduced from 8 to 2 km s–1 and 10 to 6 km 

s–1, respectively, when material strength is considered.

Introduction 

This  document  includes  the  input  parameters  pertaining  to  the  constitutive  model 

employed in this study (Text S1; Figure S1; Table S1), the iSALE model setup (Text S2; 

Table  S2),  the  effect  of  spatial  resolution  on  the  results  (Text  S3,  Figure  S2),  and  the 

effect of strength on the kinetic energy carried away by the ejecta (Text S4, Figure S3).

We  employed  an  experiment-based  strength  model  to  treat  elastoplastic 

behavior  of  rocky  materials  (Eq.  1  in  the  Section  2  of  the  Main  text).  The 

pressure-dependent yield strength for intact rock Yi is approximate by (Lundborg, 1968) 

Yi	  =	  Ycoh,i+

μintP
μintP
Ylimit-Ycoh,i

1+

, (S1) 

where  Ycoh,i  ,  µint,  P,  and  Ylimit  are  the  cohesion  for  intact  rock  at  zero  pressure,  the 
coefficient of internal friction for intact rock, temporal mean pressure, and the limiting 

strength at high pressure, respectively. The limiting strength Ylimit is known as the von 

Mises Plastic limit. Since the yield strength for comminuted rocks Yd is also limited by 

the plastic limit, the expression of Yd actually used in our model is   

Yd = min(Ycoh+µdamP, Yi), (S2) 

where  Ycoh  and µdam  are  the  cohesion  in  damaged  rocks  and  the  coefficient  of  internal 
friction for damaged rocks, respectively. We list the input parameters for the constitutive 

model in Table S1. Figure S1 shows the yield strength Yd as a function of mean pressure 

with  different  values  of  µdam.  The  slopes  of  the  straight  lines  correspond  to  µdam.  At 
lower pressures than the intersects between the straight lines for damaged rock and the 

curve for intact rock, the internal friction plays main role to produce the additional heat. 

Above the pressures, the plastic deformation against the limiting strength becomes more 

important.

We  conducted  another  series  of  iSALE  runs  to  address  the  effects  of 

differences  in  spatial  resolution.  We  varied  the  number  of  cells  per  projectile  radius 
from 25 to 200 in this series. The impact velocity was fixed at 6 km s–1. The other input 

values in the iSALE model were the same as for the regular runs. Figure S2 shows MAr 
and  Mmelt  as  a  function  of  the  scaled  time  t/ts,  where  ts  =  2Rp/vimp,  Rp,  and  vimp  are  the 

characteristic  time  for  projectile  penetration,  the  projectile  radius,  and  the  impact 

velocity,  respectively.  Although  MAr  and  Mmelt  tend  to  show  larger  values  for  lower 

CPPR values during the early stages of impact events, t/ts < 1, they converge to similar 

values by t/ts =10. Thus, the spatial resolution employed in this study is sufficiently high 

to investigate MAr and Mmelt.

Figure S3 shows the cumulative ejected mass, Mej, for velocities higher than a 

given  velocity  prior  to  t  =  19ts  as  a  function  of  ejection  velocity,  vej.  We  plotted  the 
results for 6 km s–1 including material strength for µdam = 0.6 (red) and without strength 

(blue).  The  ejected  mass,  Mej,  for  µdam  =  0.6  is  systematically  smaller  than  for  the 
hydrodynamic  case.  The  difference  in  Mej  between  the  cases  is  a  factor  of  2–4.  The 

difference  in  the  kinetic  energy  carried  away  by  the  ejecta  is  also  shown,  along  the 

right-hand  y  axis  (black),  showing  that  it  reaches  ~2  MJ  kg–1.  In  this  calculation,  the 

cumulative kinetic energy carried away by the ejecta is divided by the projectile mass. 
Since Cp ~1000 J K–1 kg–1, this energy difference corresponds to a temperature increase 
of  ~2000  K  in  rocky  materials  with  a  mass  of  1  Mp.  Consequently,  the  kinetic  energy 

lost owing to the material strength accounts for the additional heating during pressure

strength for µdam = 0.6 and without strength are shown as red and blue lines (left-hand y 
axis),  respectively.  The  difference  in  the  kinetic  energy  carried  away  by  the  ejecta 

between the cases is shown as the dashed black line (right-hand y axis).
