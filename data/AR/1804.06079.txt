Modulations of the Surface Magnetic Field on the
Intra-cycle Variability of Total Solar Irradiance

J. C. Xu1,2,3 • D. F. Kong1 • F. Y. Li1,4

Abstract Solar photospheric magnetic ﬁeld plays a
dominant role in the variability of total solar irradiance
(TSI). The modulation of magnetic ﬂux at six speciﬁc
ranges on TSI is characterized for the ﬁrst time. The
daily ﬂux values of magnetic ﬁeld at four ranges are
extracted from MDI/SOHO, together with daily ﬂux
of active regions (MFar) and quiet regions (MFqr); the
ﬁrst four ranges (MF1−4) are: 1.5–2.9, 2.9–32.0, 32.0–
42.7, and 42.7–380.1 (×1018 Mx per element), respec-
tively. Cross-correlograms show that MF4, MFqr, and
MFar are positively correlated with TSI, while MF2
is negatively correlated with TSI; the correlations be-
tween MF1, MF3 and TSI are insigniﬁcant. The boot-
strapping tests conﬁrm that the impact of MF4 on TSI
is more signiﬁcant than that of MFar and MFqr, and
MFar leads TSI by one rotational period. By extract-
ing the rotational variations in the MFs and TSI, the
modulations of the former on the latter at the solar ro-
tational timescale are clearly illustrated and compared
during solar maximum and minimum times, respec-
tively. Comparison of the relative amplitudes of the
long-term variation show that TSI is in good agreement
with the variation of MF4 and MFar; besides, MF2 is
in antiphase with TSI, and it lags the latter by about
1.5 years.

1 INTRODUCTION

Total solar irradiance (TSI) is the entire radiative power
per unit area measured above the Earth’s atmosphere
and normalized to the mean Sun-Earth distance of one
AU, given in SI units of Watts per square meter (W
m−2). TSI is the major external source of energy input
into the Earth’s climate system; therefore, besides other
mechanisms such as anthropogenic greenhouse eﬀect
and ozone variations, the variability of TSI is consid-
ered as one of the key and most obvious factors that lead
to the climate change during the last century (see re-
views, e.g., Haigh 2007; Gray et al. 2010; Solanki et al.
2013, and references therein). Additionally, TSI is a
fundamental parameter of the Sun itself as a star. The
space-borne observations since late 1978 reveal that TSI
is varying at all of the timescales at which it has been
measured, i.e., from minutes to decades (Lean 1991;
Fr¨ohlich & Lean 2004; Unruh et al. 2008; Krivova et al.
2011; Li et al. 2012; Fr¨ohlich 2013; Wehrli et al. 2013).
It is widely acknowledged that the variation of TSI is
intimately related with the solar surface magnetic ﬁeld.
Examinations with the measurements of TSI during
the last four decades show that the variation of surface
magnetism dominates the variation of TSI at timescales
from a day to the Schwabe cycle (Domingo et al. 2009).
It is believed that the large-scale solar magnetic ﬁeld is
generated by a global large-scale dynamo in the convec-
tion zone; this type of dynamo, which is best shown by
sunspots and the solar cycle, is caused by the α eﬀect
together with the Ω eﬀect (Charbonneau 2014). With
the development of observational techniques, it is found
that small-scale magnetic elements are everywhere at

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

anytime on the solar surface. These small-scale mag-
netic ﬁelds are speculated to be caused by local small-
scale dynamo processes (Karak & Brandenburg 2016).
However, it is also possible that these small-scale mag-
netic ﬁelds may mainly come from a higher latitude
or emerge from the subsurface shear layer (Xu & Gao
2016).

Based on our understandings of the TSI variation,
various models are built to reconstruct TSI, so as to
validate our understandings and extend the TSI data
set for the sake of many other scientiﬁc topics. Proxies
of the solar surface magnetic ﬁeld such as the sunspot
numbers, the photometric sunspot index, the Mg II in-
dex , the F10.7 radio ﬂux, and the Lyman-α ﬂux are
commonly used to reconstruct TSI with proxies mod-
els. Usually, these indices represent either the dark-
ening eﬀect of sunspots or the brightening eﬀect of
faculae and networks (Hudson 1988; Fr¨ohlich & Lean
2004). The 4-component proxy model
in Fr¨ohlich
(2012) is proved to be capable of explainning 84.7% of
the TSI variance in the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches
Observatorium Davos (PMOD) composite data dur-
ing 1978-2011. A prominent empirical proxy model is
the Naval Research Laboratory Total Solar Irradiance
(NRLTSI) (Lean 2000; Coddington et al. 2015), and
the correlation between the model and the Total Irradi-
ance Monitor/Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment
(TIM/SORCE) observation is 0.96. Another type of
successful model is the semi-empirical model. Various
authors have used solar magnetograms and photomet-
ric images to reconstruct the solar total and spectral
irradiance (see, e.g., Foukal & Lean 1986; Fligge et al.
1998, 2000; Krivova et al. 2003, 2006; Ball et al. 2012;
Yeo et al. 2014). Ball et al. (2012) found that the re-
constructed TSI can account for 92% of the variations
in the PMOD (Fr¨ohlich & Lean 1998), and over 96%
of that in solar cycle 23; the reconstruction is carried
out with magnetograms and continuum images from
the Michelson Doppler Imager on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (MDI/SOHO) and the Kitt
Peak Observatory, with an assumption that the TSI
variation is solely caused by the changes of the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld. Dasi-Espuig et al. (2016) re-
constructed TSI back to 1700 with simulated magne-
In
togram based on a surface ﬂux transport model.
addition, as for the various long-term reconstructions
of TSI, Soon et al. (2015) conclude that they can be
categorized into two main groups according to whether
they show a substantial increase since the Maunder
Minimum, namely the high- and low solar variability
family.

Despite the great progress in reconstructing the TSI
based on the surface magnetic ﬁeld or its proxies, the

relation between the small-scale magnetic ﬁeld and TSI
is not yet clear. Li et al. (2012) examined the variation
of TSI on the inter-solar-cycle scale, and concluded that
it is constituted by three parts: a rotational variation
part which is caused by large magnetic structures, an
annual variation part which might be caused by the
annual change of Earth’s helio-latitude, and an inter-
solar-cycle part which is caused by the network mag-
netic elements in the range (42.7–380.1) × 1018 Mx
per element. Using the Magnetic Plage Strength Index
and Mount Wilson Sunspot Index which roughly rep-
resent the weak and strong solar magnetic ﬁeld activ-
ity, Xiang & Kong (2015) studied the relation between
magnetic ﬁeld and TSI, and also found that the weak
magnetic ﬁeld dominates the inter-solar-cycle variation.
In this study, we characterize the impact of magnetic
ﬂux of speciﬁc ranges on the intra-cycle variability of
TSI with magnetic ﬂux data extracted from the magne-
tograms of MDI/SOHO. In Section 2 the data used in
this research are introduced brieﬂy. The methods, anal-
yses, results, and discussions are presented in Section 3.
In the last section, we conclude the results.

2 Data

The data used in this research include daily values of
six categories of magnetic ﬂux (MF) and one TSI com-
posite data.

2.1 Magnetic Flux

Since the discovery of magnetism in sunspots (Hale
1908), it was found out soon that magnetic ﬁeld can be
detected everywhere in the solar atmosphere (Stenﬂo
2015). However, at present, only magnetic ﬁelds in
the photosphere can be measured precisely with op-
tical instruments. Within the ability of the current
resolutions of telescopes, besides obviously recogniz-
able active regions with strong magnetic ﬁelds, mag-
netic elements are found to be sprinkled all over the
photosphere (Sheeley 1966; Harvey 1971). The dis-
tinguishable small-scale magnetic elements are mainly
composed of network elements, intra-network elements,
and ephemeral regions. Jin et al. (2011) decomposed
the magnetograms of MDI/SOHO (daily) and extracted
millions of small-scale elements; these magnetic ele-
ments were grouped into several categories according
to their ﬂux quantities (Mx per element) and their
relations with the sunspot numbers. They obtained
ﬂux data sets of magnetic elements in four diﬀerent
ranges, together with the total ﬂux of active regions
and quiet regions. The full-disk magnetograms of the

3

MDI/SOHO that were used for extraction cover the
time interval from 1996 September to 2010 February,
which is about 13.5 years and includes the whole solar
cycle 23.

In the process of decomposition, one 5-minute av-
eraged magnetogram is extracted on each day, and it
is smoothed to further reduce the noise level which is
determined to be 6 Mx cm−2. It is assumed that the
observed line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld is a projection of
the intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld whose direction is normal to
the solar surface, and thus the MF in each pixel is cor-
rected according to its location on the magnetogram.
The MF of pixels with heliocentric angles larger than
60◦ is set to 0 due to the scarce magnetic signals. The
threshold of the edge for active regions is 15 Mx cm−2,
and only islands within a heliocentric angle of 60◦ with
an area larger than 9×9 pixels, or islands smaller than
9 × 9 pixels within 60◦ but larger than 9 × 9 pixels
within 70◦, are considered as active regions. After the
active regions are excluded, magnetic concentrations
with more than 10 pixels in size in the quiet magne-
tograms are recognized as network magnetic elements
(Hagenaar et al. 2003; Jin et al. 2011).
In total, over
13 million magnetic elements are identiﬁed, which in-
clude active features and network magnetic elements.
Observationally, these small-scale network elements are
mainly from the decayed fragmentations of active re-
gions, the ﬂux emergence in the form of ephemeral re-
gions, the coalescence of intra-network ﬂux, and prod-
ucts of the interaction among diﬀerent sources of mag-
netic ﬂux (Jin et al. 2011; Jin & Wang 2014).

These magnetic elements are sorted according to
their ﬂux and their correlation with the sunspot num-
bers. They can be categorized into four ﬂux ranges,
together with the total ﬂux of active regions (MFar)
and quiet regions (MFqr). The values for the ﬁrst four
ranges (MF1−4) are: 1.5–2.9, 2.9–32.0, 32.0–42.7, and
42.7–380.1 (×1018 Mx per element). All of the data
sets are plotted in Figure 1. Note that the four ranges
are meant for individual magnetic elements, while the
data sets shown in Figure 1 are the daily total ﬂux
at each range. As indicated in Jin et al. (2011), the
MF1−4 are the no-correlation elements, anti-phase ele-
ments, transition elements, and in-phase elements, re-
spectively, depending on their relation with the sunspot
numbers. The ﬂuxes in active regions and quiet regions,
i.e., MFar and MFqr, are in-phase with the solar activ-
ity cycle.

the detailed descriptions of the instruments (there are
nearly ten instruments) can be found in, e.g., Fr¨ohlich
(2012). Due to the limited lifetime of an individ-
ual instrument, various observations have to be com-
posed into a continuous sequence, which requires labo-
rious eﬀorts. There are mainly three composite data
presented, namely the Active Radio Irradiance Mon-
itor (ACRIM) (Willson 1997; Willson & Mordvinov
2003), the PMOD (Fr¨ohlich & Lean 1998; Fr¨ohlich
2006), and the Royal Meteorological Institute of Bel-
gium (IRMB) (Dewitte et al. 2004). The diﬀerences
between the three composite data sets are discussed
in Fr¨ohlich (2012) and Zacharias (2014). There are still
debates about which one represents the real variation
of TSI (especially the intra-cycle variation); some peo-
ple believe PMOD is more reliable (Gray et al. 2010),
while others prefer ACRIM (Soon et al. 2015). The new
composite proposed by Dudok de Wit et al. (2017) is
probably helpful in resolving this issue. In this study,
we will use the PMOD composite data as a represen-
tative of TSI, and it is shown in Figure 2. The cur-
rently accepted average value of TSI is 1, 360.8 ± 0.5 W
m−2 (Kopp & Lean 2011), and its long-term variation
is obviously inphase with the ∼11-year solar activity
cycle.

the MFs and TSI. This method is widely used for de-
termining the mutual correlation and phase relation be-
tween two time series (e.g. Peterson et al. 1998; Li et al.
2016b). The detailed calculation method is described
in Xu & Gao (2016). An advantage of this method is
that there is no need to take care of data gaps which are
simply excluded from the analysis. The length of the
MF data sets is 4929 days (from 1996 September 1 to
2010 Feburary 28), and on 1139 days there are no data.
In the calculation of the cross-correlation analysis, the
missing data are just excluded. The cross-correlograms
between the six types of MF and TSI are shown in Fig-
ure 3. A cross-correlogram is a plot of cross-correlation
coeﬃcients against time lags.

 
 
 
 
5

As can be seen in Figure 3, the correlation coeﬃ-
cient (abbreviated as ‘CC’ throughout) indicates that
MF4, MFqr, and MFar (the upper panel) are positively
correlated with TSI, while MF2 (the bottom panel) is
anticorrelated with TSI. The rest of the two types of
ﬂux, i.e., MF1 and MF3 (the middle panel), are not
correlated with TSI, since their CCs are insigniﬁcant
(lie between −0.08 and 0.01). To be more speciﬁc, the
bottom panel in Figure 3 shows that the CCs between
MF2 and TSI are negative. The CC bottoms out at
−0.54 at a time lag of around 0, which means that the
maximum of TSI occurs at the time when the ﬂux of
MF2 reaches its minimum. In the upper panel, it shows
that MFar and TSI are positively correlated, and their
CC at lag 0 is 0.64. The CC peaks at 0.75 when MFar
is lagged with respect to TSI by 27 days, which means
that the former probably leads the latter by a solar ro-
tational period on average in phase. The CC between
MF4 and TSI at lag 0 (0.76) is larger than that of MFqr
(0.70), and also larger than that of MFar.

It also shows in the upper panel that the variation
of the CC between MFar and TSI around lag 0 behaves
diﬀerently than that of the other two (MF4 and MFqr).
In other words, CC of MFar shows a dip near lag 0,

while both CCs of MF4 and MFqr show a peak.
means that, although the overall impact of MFar on
TSI is positive (enhancing TSI) at long-term timescales,
there is a part in MFar which should have an instant
negative (reducing TSI) impact at timescale of the solar
rotation period. This situation happens to neither MF4
nor MFqr. The waxing and waning of the CCs in all of
the three panels also indicate short-term modulations
that are related with the rotation of the Sun: the CCs
show dips or peaks at lags that are integral multiples
of the ∼27-day rotational period, i.e., -27, 0, 27, 54
days, etc. The correlograms show both long-term and
short-term correlations between the data sets.

To conﬁrm whether the lead of MFar with respect
to TSI is signiﬁcant, and also to compare the mod-
ulations of MF4, MFqr and MFar on TSI, we make
use of the bootstrap method. The bootstrap method
is a resampling procedure that is suggested by Efron
for the ﬁrst time, and it has been widely used to han-
dle statistical inference problems in many research ar-
eas. The primary advantage of this method is that
it does not require a stringent model assumption on
the underlying random process that generates the data.
In this study, the non-overlapping block bootstrap
method is used, and a detailed description of the spe-
ciﬁc process can be found in Xu et al. (2017). Basically,
each application of the non-overlapping block bootstrap
method with cross-correlation analysis yields ﬁve thou-
sand pairs of CCs. Note that the bootstrap method is

Correlation Coefficients Between MF4 and TSI (CCMF4 − TSI)

in if the two coeﬃcients are equal.

used here for determining the uncertainties of the CCs
between MF4, MFar and TSI, but not for determining
whether the MFs and TSI are signiﬁcantly correlated or
not. The physical causation between them (the surface
magnetic ﬁeld and TSI) is widely accepted (see, e.g.,
Domingo et al. 2009).

To compare the correlations between MF4, MFar
and TSI, we perform the bootstrap method on be-
tween MF4, MFar, and TSI, respectively, and 5000 CCs
between MF4 and TSI (CCMF4−TSI) and 5000 CCs
between MFar and TSI (CCMFar−TSI) are obtained.
They are plotted in Figure 4. Figure 4 indicates that
only 3 out of the 5000 points are located above the
diagonal, which means that only 3 CCMF4−TSI are
smaller than CCMFar−TSI. Therefore, the probability
that CCMF4−TSI is larger than CCMFar−TSI is 99.94%.
With the bootstrap method, 5000 CCs of MFqr versus
TSI (CCMFqr−TSI) are also calculated. The CCMF4−TSI
against CCMFqr−TSI are plotted in Figure 5. There are
137 points located above the diagonal, thus the prob-
ability that CCMF4−TSI is larger than CCMFqr−TSI is
about 97.3%.

The bootstrapping tests conﬁrm that CCMF4−TSI is
larger than both CCMFqr−TSI and CCMFar−TSI, which
infers that the impact of MF4 on TSI is more signiﬁcant
than that of MFar and MFqr.

In order to conﬁrm the phase relation between MFar
and TSI, another bootstrapping is carried out. 5000

Fig. 6 Scatter plot of the correlation coeﬃcients between
MFar and TSI at lag 0 against that at the lag of 27 days.

CCs between them at a 27-day lag (CCar27) are ob-
tained, and they are plotted in Figure 6. As can be seen
in Figure 6, all of the points are located above the diag-
onal, which implies that the probability that CCar27 is
larger than CCar0 is approximately 100%. Therefore, it
means that MFar indeed leads TSI by 27 days or about
one rotational period.

At the timescale of a solar rotational period, TSI is
modulated by the tradeoﬀ of darkening by sunspots and
brightening by faculae, together with the brightening of
small-scale network elements in and outside active re-
gions (Hudson et al. 1982). Faculae and sunspots usu-
ally occur at the same time in active regions. As shown
in Figure 1 in Jin et al. (2011), the active region areas
deﬁned are much larger than the area of sunspots seen
in a continuum image, thus the ﬂux in active regions
MFar includes ﬂux from areas of both ‘dark’ sunspots
and ‘bright’ faculae whose impacts on TSI are opposite.
The evolutionary behaviors of the sunspots and fac-
ulae are very diﬀerent from each other. The life-
time of faculae is much longer than that of sunspots:
sunspots usually decay and disappear after one rota-
tion, but faculae can live as long as several rotation
periods (Fr¨ohlich 2012). When sunspots ﬁrst appear
on the photosphere, they cause an instant reduction on
TSI especially in the visible wavelength band. How-
ever, despite the obvious darkening eﬀect of sunspots,
there are faculae and networks that cause even more
signiﬁcant brightening and overcompensate TSI, which
explains why the cross-correlation between MFar and

TSI shows an overall positive relation with a sharp dip
at lag 0. After one rotation, sunspots usually decay
into small-scale magnetic elements, but faculae are still
alive, which leads to the increase of TSI. That is why
TSI lags MFar by a solar rotation period.

To further investigate the modulations of the MFs
on TSI, particularly at the rotational timescale, we de-
compose them and extract their rotational parts as in
the following section.

3.2 Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode

Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN)

Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is an adaptive
algorithm which decomposes a signal into a set of func-
tions, known as Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), and
a residual called a trend. The IMFs are extracted from
the signal itself using a process called sifting, and they
represent the intrinsic high- and low-frequency oscilla-
tions in the original signal. A complete description of
this algorithm can be found in Huang et al. (1998).

However, in the original EMD method, there is a
problem named “mode mixing” which means that the
presence of disparate frequency oscillations in the same
mode, or the presence of similar oscillations in diﬀerent
modes (Huang & Wu 2008). To overcome the “mode
mixing” problem, Wu & Huang (2009) proposed an im-
proved method named the Ensemble Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EEMD). In this method, the EMD is
performed over an ensemble of the signal plus Gaussian

white noise. Nevertheless, it brings new problems: the
reconstructed signal contains residual noise; and even
more seriously, diﬀerent realizations can produce diﬀer-
ent numbers of IMFs. To resolve this problem, a varia-
tion of EEMD is proposed by M.E.Torres et al. (2011):
the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposi-
tion with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN). The CEEM-
DAN provides an exact reconstruction of the original
signal and a better spectral separation of the modes,
as well as advantages including less number of sifting
iteration and lower computational cost.

The EMD (and EEMD, CEEMDAN) method does
not require a priori assumption about the signal type,
therefore it is widely and successfully used in the
analysis of non-linear and non-stationary real-world
signals, such as the variability of total solar irradi-
ance (Li et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2015), the periodicity of
ﬂare index (Gao et al. 2011), the research of solar mean
magnetic ﬁeld (Xiang & Qu 2016), the sunspot num-
bers (Barnhart & Eichinger 2011), etc (either EMD or
EEMD is used in these studies). This method is more
eﬀective than the traditional Fourier analysis in ex-
tracting modes with time-variable amplitudes and time-
varying frequencies in signals.
In contrast, the latter
method only decomposes data into ﬁxed amplitudes
and frequencies. Due to the fact that the Sun is not
a rigid body and thus its rotation is a diﬀerential rota-
tion with varying frequencies, the CEEMDAN is par-
ticularly suitable in this study.

In order to determine and compare the variations
in the MFs and TSI on variable timescales, we use the
CEEMDAN to extract the temporal variations in them.
The missing values in the data sets are interpolated
with piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomi-
als. The temporal variations of the IMFs of magnetic
ﬂux in active regions (MFar) are shown, as an example,
in Figure 7. It is obviously shown that the extracted
IMFs range from high frequency (days) to low frequency
(years). The last mode represents a nonlinear trend in
MFar, which indicates an estimate of the MFar varia-
tion at the timescale of the ∼11-year sunspot activity
cycle. The sum of these ten IMFs (IMF1–10) and the
trend is identical to the original data set of MFar; that
is to say, MFar can be entirely represented by IMF1–10
together with the trend.

The 10 extracted IMFs are supposed to be modes
in MFar with diﬀerent frequencies or periods, although
the period in each mode may not be constant. Then,
for each IMF of MFar, we apply the Lomb-Scargle peri-
odogram (LSP) so as to obtain its period of oscillation.
The LSP method is very useful in determining period-
icities in time series even when there is a large amount
of missing samples, and its algorithm is introduced in

detail in Xu & Gao (2016). The obtained periods of
IMF3–9 of MFar are show in the third row in Table 1.
Similarly, we applied the CEEMDAN and LSP anal-
yses on MF2, MF4, and TSI, respectively. We ob-
tained their IMFs, as well as their corresponding pe-
riods, which are also tabulated in Table 1.

It is found that the periods of the ﬁfth modes of MF2
and MF4 are both 26.2 days, and that of MFar and TSI
are 26.6, 26.7 days, respectively, as indicated in the 4th
column in Table 1. Obviously, the ﬁfth mode (IMF5) of
both the MFs and TSI represent their respective ∼27-
day rotational variations, and IMF4, IMF6 are inferred
to represent their 13.5-, 54-day period variations. In or-
der to ensure that an IMF contains a true signal, we test
the statistical signiﬁcance of the seven IMFs (Figure 8).
The statistical signiﬁcance of the periods obtained can
be determined by comparing spectral powers between
the data set and white noise data (Wu & Huang 2004).
When the white noise signiﬁcance test is applied, all
the 13.5-, 27-, 54-day periods of the IMFs are statistical
signiﬁcant within the 99% signiﬁcance level. Xu & Gao
(2016) investigated the rotational characteristics of the
solar surface magnetic ﬁeld with the same magnetic ﬂux
data sets. By applying the LSP to the original data sets
of MFs, they found that the rotational period of MF2,
MF4, and MFar are 26.20, 26.23, and 26.66 days, re-
spectively, which is in agreement with the periods that
found here only with their IMF5s. It strongly suggests
that their IMF5s should represent the rotational varia-
tions in them.

To further study the amplitude and phase of the
∼27-day variations of MFs and their modulations to
those of TSI, the IMF5s of the four data sets are shown
in Figure 9. The years 2000 and 2001 (the upper two
panels) are shown as representatives of the solar max-
imum time, and the years 2008 and 2009 (the bottom
two panels) are shown as representatives of the solar
minimum time. Note that the abscissa denotes the Car-
rington rotation number (CRN). In order to compare
them clearly, all of the IMF5s are standardized. For
example, the standardized amplitude of the IMF5 of
MFar (as shown in the left panel of Figure 7) is esti-
mated by removing its mean and then dividing with its
standard deviation: AIMF5 = IMF5(t)−IMF5

.

σ(IMF5)

As can be seen in Figure 9, during solar maximum
time, the relative amplitudes of the MFs (MF2, MF4,
and MFar) are all larger than that during solar mini-
mum time; the situation of TSI is the same. Besides,
all of them display rotational variations, i.e., waxes and
wanes with an approximate ∼27-day period. During
the time when there are no (or very few) active regions,
such as from CRN2074 to 2086, all of the relative ampli-
tudes are very small. During solar maximum time, the

variations of MF4 and MFar are obviously out-of-phase
with that of TSI; in contrast, the former two seems in-
phase with the latter during solar minimum time.

The relative amplitudes and phase relations of the
MFs and TSI are related with the emergence and evo-
lution of active regions on the rotating solar photo-
sphere. Magnetic ﬂux tubes in the subsurface region
emerge to the solar photosphere and form active re-
gions very quickly, and the process lasts for up to 5
days. However, the dispersion of an active region takes
much longer. Depending on the property of the active
region, it takes 4 to 10 months for an active region to
disperse to the magnetic ﬂux density level of the quite-
Sun (Cheung et al. 2016). As for sunspots, according
to the Gnevyshev-Waldmeier rule, most of the sunspots
only live for less than a day (Solanki 2003). At solar
maximum time as in the years 2000 and 2001, active re-
gions emerge to the surface frequently. Therefore, TSI
is constantly modulated by a compound eﬀect of multi-
ple active regions. So the quantities of ﬂux in the MFs
vary quickly, and the relative amplitudes of the MFs
and TSI are larger. Since sunspots have a negative in-
stant impact on TSI, MFar and TSI are not inphase or
even in antiphase during most of time at solar maxi-
mum as shown in the upper two panels.

In 2008 and 2009, there are 516 out of the 730 days
(72.3%) when there were no sunspots (sunspot num-
ber equals to 0) on the solar surface. The minimum

of solar cycle 24 is in a very low level of magnetic ac-
tivity (Li et al. 2016a). During solar minimum time,
active regions rarely appear, therefore the modulation
of a sole active region can be clearly seen. For example,
there is an outburst in CRN2068 in 2008 as indicated
with a black arrow in the third panel of Figure 9. It
can be seen that the amplitudes of MFar, MF2, MF4
and TSI all increased after the burst. The amplitude
of MFar and TSI ﬁrst increased and then decline to
tranquility after about 4 rotation periods until CRN
2072. MFar and TSI are in antiphase during the fol-
lowing around ten days, and then become inphase when
the sunspot disappears and TSI is only modulated by
‘bright’ faculae and network features. The outburst can
be seen obviously from the variations of the MFs and
TSI here; it can also be identiﬁed easily with the sudden
rise of the sunspot numbers. Note that it is due to the
outburst in late 2007 that the amplitudes of the MFs
and TSI at the beginning of 2008 (before CRN2067) are
also relatively large.

In order to show the phase relations between the
rotational variations of the MFs and TSI during maxi-
mum (years 2000 to 2001) and minimum (years 2008 to
2009) times more clearly, a cross-correlation analysis is
performed between the IMF5s of MF2, MF4, MFar, and
TSI, respectively, and the result is shown in Figure 10.
It is depicted in the upper and lower panels that MFar
is in antiphase with TSI during solar maximum and in-
phase during solar minimum, while MF2 always shows
an antiphase relation with TSI. It also implies that the
impact of MF2 on TSI is similar at diﬀerent timescales
(referring to the bottom panel in Figure 3). As for MF4,
it is inphase with TSI during solar minimum; and dur-
ing solar maximum, there is a phase diﬀerence between
them. The variations of all of the CCs indicate a clear
regular rotational modulation.

At solar maximum times, TSI is usually continu-
ously modulated by multiple sunspots (and active re-
gions where they are situated) on the solar surface at
the same time. Due to the instant darkening eﬀect of
sunspots, MFar and TSI are anti-correlated at the so-
lar rotational timescale, as shown in the upper panel.
During solar minimum time, there can be only faculae
but no sunspots; even when there are small sunspots
emerge occasionally, they decay and disappear soon.
Thus, the TSI is then mainly solely modulated by fac-
ulae and networks which cause the positive correlation
between MFar and TSI as shown in the lower panel.

With the CEEMDAN, both TSI and the MFs can
be separated into short-term variations with shorter
than around one year period, and long-term variations
with longer than one year period. The one year period,
which is approximately the periods of IMF8 of the MFs

and TSI, is chosen because that is about the uppermost
time for an active region to decay and disperse into
quiet Sun network magnetic ﬁeld (Cheung et al. 2016).
The relative amplitudes of the long-term variations of
the MFs and TSI are shown in Figure 11.

It is displayed in the ﬁgure that the intra-cycle long-
term variations of MF4 and MFar are in very good
agreement with that of TSI, while MF2 is in obvious
antiphase with them.

To further conﬁrm their phase relation, another
cross-correlation analysis is performed and the result is
shown in Figure 12. The correlation functions of MF4
and TSI and that of MFar and TSI are very similar,
and they peak at around lag 0 with a coeﬃcient of 0.96
and 0.97, respectively. The CC between MF2 and TSI
at lag 0 is −0.65, and it bottoms out at −0.90 at a 539-
day lag, which is around 1.5 years; it implies that the
long-term part of MF2 lags (negatively) that of TSI by
around one and a half year, and the reason for this is not
clear. Xu & Gao (2016) speculated that the magnetic
elements contributing to MF2 may mainly come from a
higher latitude or emerge from a subsurface shear layer
named the leptocline.

4 Conclusion

There is increasing evidence that the variations of so-
lar irradiance is one of the key factors that inﬂuence
the global climate. The surface magnetic ﬁeld plays
an important role in the variability of the solar total

and spectral irradiance (Domingo et al. 2009). Using
daily values of solar photospheric magnetic ﬂux data
sets at four speciﬁc ranges (MF1∼4) together with the
total ﬂux of active regions (MFar) and quiet regions
(MFqr), we examined and characterized the intra-cycle
modulation of diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux to the variability
of TSI. The time interval of the data sets is from 1996
September 1 to 2010 February 28. The data sets used in
this study is unique due to the fact that it is the only
space-borne measurements of the full-disk solar mag-
netic ﬁeld with a consistent sensitivity and resolution
for a cycle-long time interval.

Cross-correlation analyses between the full data sets
of MF and TSI show that MF2 is negatively correlated
with TSI, while MF4, MFar, and MFqr are all posi-
tively correlated with TSI. In addition, both MF1 and
MF3 show insigniﬁcant correlation with TSI. The vari-
ations of the correlation coeﬃcients indicate obvious
rotational modulations.

Bootstrapping tests conﬁrm that the correlation co-
eﬃcient between MF4 and TSI is larger than that of
both MFar and MFqr, which implies that the modula-
tion of magnetic elements in range MF4 on the vari-
ations of TSI is more signiﬁcant than that of active
regions and quiet regions. The sharp dip at lag 0 of
the CC between MFar and TSI indicates that part of
the ﬂux in the former should have an instant negative
(reducing) impact on TSI despite the overall positive
(enhancing) impact, we infer that it is due to the dark-
ening eﬀect of sunspots. The peaks at around lag 0 of
the CC between MF4, MFqr and TSI show their posi-
tive instant impacts on TSI. The cross-correlogram and
bootstrapping between MFar and TSI display that the

former should lag the latter by 27 days, or around one
solar rotation period. This is due to the diﬀerences of
the eﬀect and lifetime of sunspots and faculae which
are the main magnetic features that modulate TSI on
the rotational timescale.

By extracting the rotational variations in the MFs
and TSI with the CEEMDAN method, the modula-
tions of the former on the latter at the solar rota-
tional timescale are clearly shown and compared dur-
ing solar maximum and minimum times, respectively.
At solar maximum times, there are usually multiple
active regions exist on the solar surface at the same
time, thus the relative amplitudes of the MFs and TSI
are all much larger compared with that at solar min-
imum time. MFar is negatively correlated with TSI,
which is a result of the instant darkening eﬀect of mul-
tiple sunspots. The correlogram during minimum time
shows that both MF4 and MFar are inphase with TSI.
The correlation between MF2 and TSI is negative at
either solar maximum or solar minimum, and the im-
pact of the former on the latter is similar at diﬀer-
ent timescales. All of the CCs show a clear variation
with the solar rotational period. The modulation of an
unique sunspot can be seen clearly at solar minimum,
which is illustrated in detail with the 2008 outburst in
CRN2068.

Comparison of the relative amplitudes of the long-
term variation shows that TSI is in good agreement
with the variation of MF4 and MFar; their CCs are as
high as 0.96 (between MF4 and TSI) and 0.97 (between
MFar and TSI) around 0 lag. MF2 is in antiphase with
them, and it lags TSI by about 1.5 years.
