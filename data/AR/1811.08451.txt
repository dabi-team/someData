(Dated: October 22, 2021)

The ﬁrst γ-ray spectroscopy of 52Ar, with the neutron number N = 34, was measured using the
53K(p,2p) one-proton removal reaction at ∼210 MeV/u at the RIBF facility. The 2+
1 excitation
energy is found at 1656(18) keV, the highest among the Ar isotopes with N > 20. This result is
the ﬁrst experimental signature of the persistence of the N = 34 subshell closure beyond 54Ca, i.e.,
below the magic proton number Z = 20. Shell-model calculations with phenomenological and chiral-
eﬀective-ﬁeld-theory interactions both reproduce the measured 2+
1 systematics of neutron-rich Ar
isotopes, and support a N = 34 subshell closure in 52Ar.

PACS numbers: xxxxxxxx

In the shell-model description of atomic nuclei, magic
numbers of nucleons correspond to fully occupied energy
shells below the Fermi surface [1], and present the
backbone of our understanding of nuclei.
Scientiﬁc
advances over the past decades have shown that the
sequence of magic numbers established for stable nuclei

is not universal across the nuclear landscape [2]. A
few prominent examples are the breakdown of the
conventional N = 20, 28 magic numbers [3–5] and the
emergence of a new N = 16 magic number [6, 7] in
neutron-rich nuclei. Considerable eﬀorts have been spent
to unfold the driving forces behind such shell evolution

 
 
 
 
 
 
[8–11].

For rare isotopes, the ﬁrst 2+ excitation energy [E(2+
1 )]
in even-even nuclei is often the ﬁrst observable accessible
to experiment to characterize shell eﬀects. In a simpliﬁed
shell model picture, a high E(2+
1 ) is interpreted as
resulting from nucleon excitations across a large shell gap
[12].

Recently, neutron-rich pf-shell nuclei have received
much attention on both experimental and theoretical
fronts with the possible appearance of new subshell
closures at N = 32 and 34. A sizable N = 32 subshell
closure has been reported in the region from Ar to
Cr isotopes based on E(2+
1 ) [13–16], reduced transition
probabilities B(E2; 0+
1 →2+
1 ) [17, 18], and mass [19–21]
measurements, although some ambiguity remains due to
the newly measured large charge radii of 49,51,52Ca [22],
masses of 51−55Ti [23], and the low E(2+
1 ) in 50Ar [16].
On the other hand, the N = 34 subshell closure has
been so far suggested only in 54Ca [24, 25].
In the Ti
and Cr isotopes, the systematics of E(2+
1 ) [26, 27] and
B(E2; 0+
1 ) [17, 18] show no local maximum and
minimum at N = 34. The measured low-lying structure
of 55Sc [28] indicated a rapid weakening of the N = 34
subshell closure in Z > 20 nuclei. The measured E(2+
1 )
of 54Ca was 2043(19) keV, ∼0.5 MeV lower than 52Ca
[24]. Despite this lower E(2+
1 ), 54Ca was concluded to be
a doubly magic nucleus from a phenomenological shell-
interpretation [24], whereas ab initio coupled-
model
cluster calculations indicated a weak N = 34 subshell
closure [29]. Very recently, the mass measurements of
55−57Ca [25] conﬁrmed the N = 34 subshell closure in
54Ca. Until now, it is still an open question how the N =
34 subshell evolves below Z = 20 towards more neutron-
rich systems, such as 52Ar.

1 →2+

The heaviest Ar isotope with known spectroscopic
information so far is 50Ar [16]. Phenomenological shell-
model calculations [16, 30] reproducing the available
E(2+
1 ) data for neutron-rich Ar isotopes predict a
relatively high-lying 2+
1 state in 52Ar, and suggest that
the N = 34 subshell closure in 52Ar is stronger than the
one reported for 54Ca. In the present Letter, we report
on the ﬁrst spectroscopy of 52Ar, the most neutron-rich
even-even N = 34 isotone accessible today and possibly
for the next decades. A clear enhancement of E(2+
1 ) at
N = 34 is found, supporting the persistence of the N =
34 magic number in Z < 20 nuclei.

The experiment was performed at the Radioactive
Isotope Beam Factory operated by the RIKEN Nishina
Center and the Center for Nuclear Study of the Uni-
versity of Tokyo. Radioactive nuclei were produced
by fragmentation of a 345 MeV/u 70Zn primary beam
with an average beam intensity of 240 pnA on a 10-
mm-thick rotating Be target. The secondary cocktail
beam, magnetically centered on 53K, was identiﬁed using
the Bρ-∆E-TOF method [31] in the BigRIPS two-stage
fragment separator [32]. The average intensity and purity

of the 53K beam were 1.0 particle per second and 0.53%,
respectively.

The secondary beam impinged on a 151(1)-mm-thick
liquid hydrogen (LH2) target operated at 18.14 K with
a density of 73 kg/m3 to induce one-proton knockout
reactions. Two multiwire drift chambers (MDCs) [33],
located upstream of the LH2 target, were used to
measure the trajectories of the incoming projectiles. The
kinetic energy of 53K at the entrance of the target
was ∼245 MeV/u.
Its energy loss in the LH2 target
was approximately 70 MeV/u. The LH2 target was
surrounded by a 300-mm-long time projection chamber
(TPC), constituting the MINOS device [34].
The
tracks of outgoing protons were recorded by the TPC
to reconstruct reaction vertices [35]. The measured
eﬃciency to detect at least one of the two protons
is 92(3)% with an estimated vertex resolution of 4
mm (FWHM) [35]. Knowledge of reaction vertices
allowed precise Doppler correction of de-excitation γ rays
measured by the DALI2+ [36] γ-ray spectrometer, which
surrounded the MINOS device.

DALI2+ consisted of 226 NaI(Tl) crystals covering
polar angles from 15◦ to 118◦ with respect to the center of
the LH2 target. Thresholds of NaI(Tl) crystals were set
to about 50 keV. Addback was applied when the centers
of hit detectors were less than 20 cm apart. For 1 MeV γ
rays emitted from nuclei moving at 60% of the velocity
of light, the photopeak eﬃciency and energy resolution
with addback were 30% and 11% (FWHM), respectively.
DALI2+ was calibrated using 133Ba, 137Cs, 60Co, and
88Y sources yielding a calibration error of 4 keV and a
good linearity from 356 to 1836 keV.

Downstream from the LH2 target, reaction residues
were transported to the SAMURAI spectrometer [33]
and identiﬁed with the Bρ-∆E-TOF method. The Bρ
of charged fragments passing through the SAMURAI
magnet with a central magnetic ﬁeld of 2.7 T was
reconstructed using two MDCs placed upstream and
downstream the magnet [33]. The ∆E and TOF infor-

hodoscope. Figure 1 shows the particle identiﬁcation of
fragments with the selection of 53K identiﬁed at BigRIPS.
For Ar isotopes, a 6.6σ separation in Z and a 9.1σ
separation in A were achieved. Over the data taking
of seven days, 438 counts of 52Ar were accumulated
from 53K(p, 2p)52Ar reactions, in which the kinematics
of protons measured by MINOS supported a quasi-free
scattering reaction mechanism. The reaction loss of 53K
in materials along the beam and fragment trajectories
was determined by measuring the unreacted 53K. The
measured inclusive cross section was 1.9(1) mb.

The Doppler-shift corrected γ-ray energy spectrum of
52Ar is presented in Fig. 2. A clear peak is present
in the range of 1500-1800 keV, while three structures
are visible in the range of 600-900, 1000-1300 and 2000-
2500 keV. In order to quantify the signiﬁcance level
of these peaks, we performed the likelihood ratio test
by ﬁtting the spectrum of 52Ar using the GEANT4
[37] simulated response functions on top of a double-
exponential background. Given the low statistics of
the γ-ray spectrum of 52Ar, a Poisson distribution
was adopted to describe the ﬂuctuations of each bin,
and the double-exponential background line shape was
extracted from the 51K(p,2p)50Ar reaction, leaving the
magnitude of the background as a free parameter in the
ﬁtting. To estimate the systematic uncertainties caused
by this background assumption, the spectrum of 52Ar
was also ﬁtted using a free double-exponential back-
ground, as well as background line shapes extracted from
54Ca(p,pn)53Ca and 55V(p,2pn)53Ca reactions. Note
that 53Ca has similar transitions and neutron separation
energy (Sn) as 52Ar. As a result, a signiﬁcance level of
5σ was obtained for the 1656(18) keV transition. The
2295(39) keV γ line was found to have a signiﬁcance
of 3σ, while the other two structures in the range of
600-900 and 1000-1300 keV both had a signiﬁcance level
of less than 1σ and are therefore not considered in the
following analysis. Note that errors of the deduced γ-
ray energies shown above include both statistical and
systematic uncertainties. The former dominate and
the latter mainly originate from the energy calibration
uncertainty. Lifetime (τγ) eﬀects of the excited states on
the deduced γ-ray energies are negligible, since Raman’s
global systematics [38] suggests τγ < 2 ps for the observed
two states.

Based on measured γ-ray intensities, the 1656 keV
transition is attributed to a direct decay to the ground
state. The low statistics do not allow to conclude
any (non) coincidence between the 1656 and 2295 keV
transitions from γ–γ correlations. However, the cascade
scenario is very unlikely due to the expected low Sn of
52Ar that is more exotic than 54Ca. The measured Sn
of 54Ca is 3840(70) keV [19]. The 2016 Atomic Mass
Evaluation [39] gives an estimated Sn of 2660(850) keV
for 52Ar, and excludes the coincidence scenario. The

proposed energy level scheme of 52Ar is presented in the
inset of Fig. 2. The measured partial cross sections to
the 1656 and 2295 keV states are 0.9(2) and 0.4(1) mb,
respectively. Assuming no population to other excited
states, the cross section to the ground state is deduced
to be 0.7(3) mb via subtraction from the inclusive cross
section. The quoted uncertainties are dominated by
statistical errors, while systematic uncertainties mainly
arise from the estimation of MINOS eﬃciency and the
background assumption. All experimental results are
summarized in Table I. The 1656 keV state with the
higher population is assigned as 2+
1 . The 2295 keV state
decaying directly to the ground state is assigned as 2+
2 .
Further discussions about these spin-parity assignments
are given later.

Figure 3 displays the measured E(2+

1 ) in 52Ar alongside
values for lighter Ar isotopes [40]. Notably, the measured
E(2+
1 ) = 1656(18) keV in 52Ar is the highest among
the Ar isotopes with N > 20.
It is larger than the
E(2+
1 ) = 1554(1) keV [41] in 46Ar which reﬂects the
conventional N = 28 shell closure. Moreover, the
measured systematics of E(2+
1 ) along the Ar isotopic
chain is characterized by a pronounced enhancement at
N = 34 relative to its N = 32 even-even neighbor, unlike
the trend observed for Ca, Ti and Cr isotopes in which
a decrease is seen from N = 32 to 34. Our results oﬀer
the ﬁrst experimental signature of the N = 34 subshell
closure in 52Ar.

To gain further insight into the structure of 52Ar, we
compare the results to state-of-the-art nuclear structure
calculations. Here, two advanced ab initio approaches
are adopted:

lational details, see in particular Refs.
[45, 46]) and
coupled-cluster theory [47, 48], employing two sets of
two- (NN) and three-nucleon (3N) interactions derived
from chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory [49, 50]: 1.8/2.0(EM)
[46, 51, 52] and N2LOsat
[53]. The coupled-cluster
method is well suited for closed (sub-)shell nuclei and
their neighbors. By employing a double-charge ex-
change equation-of-motion (DCE-EOM) coupled-cluster
technique, the E(2+
1 ) in 40,48,52Ar are obtained from
generalized excitations of the ground states of the
closed (sub-)shell nuclei 40,48,52Ca, while the E(2+
1 ) in
44Ar is obtained from excitations of the 44S ground
state, respectively. The E(2+
1 ) in 46,50,52Ar are also
computed using the two-particle-removed equation-of-
motion (2PR-EOM) coupled-cluster method [54]. The
measured E(2+
1 ) in 52Ar oﬀers a rather unique case to
compare these two coupled-cluster methods.

In this work, we employ the DCE-EOM coupled-cluster
calculations with particle-hole excitations truncated at
the singles, doubles, and approximate triples level
(CCSDT-3) [55], while the 2PR-EOM coupled-cluster
calculations are truncated at the three-hole-one-particle
excitation level using CCSD and CCSDT-3 for the
ground states of 48,52,54Ca. Theoretical uncertainties in
coupled-cluster calculations are estimated by comparing
results with and without triples excitations. In addition,
we also compare our results to large-scale shell model
calculations with the SDPF-U [56] and SDPF-MU [57]
interactions. Note that the original SDPF-MU Hamil-
tonian was modiﬁed using recent experimental data on
exotic Ca [24] and K [58] isotopes and details of the
modiﬁcations are given in Ref. [30].

Theoretical (p,2p) cross sections to diﬀerent ﬁnal
states of 52Ar are computed with spectroscopic factors
calculated with the VS-IMSRG method using the 1.8/2.0
(EM) interaction and single-particle cross sections (σsp)
calculated using the Glauber theory as described in Ref.
[59]. The input of the σsp calculations are the nucleon-
nucleon cross sections, using the parametrization from
Ref. [60], and the nuclear ground-state densities deduced
from a mean-ﬁeld Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation
using the SLy4 interaction. The involved single-particle
states are calculated using a Woods-Saxon potential
including the Coulomb and spin-orbit terms with param-
eters chosen to reproduce the proton separation energies.
The range of the Woods-Saxon potential was taken as
R = r0(A − 1)1/3 fm with r0 = 1.25 fm, and the
diﬀuseness is chosen as 0.65 fm. The strength of the
spin-orbit potential is set to −6 MeV. Since the reaction
vertices were reconstructed with MINOS, the energy
dependence of the cross section was considered by taking
the average of σsp at diﬀerent incident energies weighted
by observed statistics ((cid:104)σsp(cid:105)). As an illustration, σsp
for the removal of a d3/2 proton in 53K to the ground
state of 52Ar varies from 2.38 mb at 180 MeV/u to
3.64 mb at 246 MeV/u. Table I lists theoretical results
for states lying below the extrapolated Sn of 52Ar [39].
As shown in Table I, the measured cross sections to
the 1656 and 2295 keV states in 52Ar agree well with
the predictions for the 2+
1 state at 1849 keV and the
2+
2 state at 2367 keV, respectively. The ratio of the
experimental cross section to the theoretical prediction
is in line with the systematic reduction factor reported
from (e,e(cid:48)p) measurements on stable targets [61] and
from (p,2p) reactions on oxygen isotopes [62, 63]. The
good agreement between experiment and theory not only
supports the spin-parity assignments, but also indicates
that the VS-IMSRG approach with the 1.8/2.0 (EM)
interaction provides a satisfactory description of the
structure of 52Ar.

We now discuss the systematics of E(2+

1 ) in Ar
isotopes. As seen in Fig. 3, phenomenological shell-
model calculations with the SDPF-U and SDPF-MU
interactions as well as the VS-IMSRG calculations with
the 1.8/2.0 (EM) interaction reproduce the steep rise of
E(2+
1 ) from 50Ar to 52Ar. The SDPF-U calculations and
the modiﬁed SDPF-MU calculations provide the best
overall description of the experimental data along the
Ar isotopic chain including the E(2+
1 ) of 52Ar. The VS-
IMSRG approach using the 1.8/2.0 (EM) interaction rea-
sonably reproduces the measured E(2+
1 ) in neutron-rich
Ar isotopes, though an overprediction is seen between N
= 28 and 34. The dependence of the ab initio calculations
on the initial NN and 3N forces is illustrated by the
VS-IMSRG calculations with the N2LOsat Hamiltonian.
Compared to results with the 1.8/2.0 (EM) interaction,
the N2LOsat Hamiltonian systematically underpredicts
the data, despite a better agreement at N = 28 and

5

evolution. Both calculations suggest that the N = 34
shell gap persists from 54Ca towards more exotic N = 34
isotones, which is consistent with the measured high-
lying 2+
state in 52Ar presented here. However, we
1
would like to emphasize that there is no direct correlation
between the measured E(2+
1 ) and the size of the shell gap
which is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the eﬀective
single-particle energies (ESPEs), since the latter is not an
observable. Indeed, calculations predicting similar E(2+
1 )
might give diﬀerent magnitudes of shell gaps. As it is the
case here, the ESPEs extracted by the modiﬁed SDPF-
MU calculations using the method described in Ref. [65]
indicate that the N = 34 shell gap in 52Ar (∼3.1 MeV)
exceeds that in 54Ca (∼2.6 MeV) [16]. Conversely, the
ESPEs calculated by the VS-IMSRG approach using the
method of Ref. [66] suggest the N = 34 shell gap in 52Ar
(∼2.6 MeV) is smaller than that in 54Ca (∼3.2 MeV).
In addition, the VS-IMSRG approach also provides the
orbital occupancies of the 0+
1 states in 52Ar and
54Ca. It reveals that in the 2+
1 excitation of 52Ar only
∼0.5 neutrons are excited from p1/2 to f5/2 and proton
excitations also contribute due to the open proton shell,
whereas in the case of 54Ca, ∼0.9 neutrons are excited
across the N = 34 shell gap. This is consistent with
the observed decrease in E(2+
1 ) between 54Ca and 52Ar.
Nevertheless, both calculations predict 48Si as a new
doubly magic nucleus. The E(2+
1 ) of 48Si in SDPF-MU
[30] and VS-IMSRG [67] calculations lies at 2.85 and
3.13 MeV, respectively. However, it is not yet known
whether 48Si ground state and its 2+
1 state are stable
against neutron emission. Mass models that reproduce
well the observed limits of existence in the pf-shell region
[68] tend to predict 48Si as a drip-line nucleus in which
continuum eﬀects might also play an important role in
the structure of 48Si.

1 and 2+

To summarize, the low-lying structure of 52Ar was
investigated using the 53K(p,2p)52Ar reaction at ∼210
MeV/u. The measured 2+
1 state lies at 1656(18) keV,
the highest among the Ar isotopes with N > 20. The
measured (p,2p) cross sections to diﬀerent ﬁnal states of
52Ar agree with calculations and support the proposed
spin-parity assignments. Shell-model calculations with
phenomenological and the chiral interaction 1.8/2.0 (EM)
both reproduce the measured 2+
systematics of the
1
neutron-rich Ar isotopes, and suggest a N = 34 subshell
closure in 52Ar. However, coupled-cluster calculations
based on the same chiral interaction underestimate the
2+
1 excitations in 52Ar. The measured E(2+
1 ) of 52Ar
serves as an important benchmark to understand the
uncertainties of the employed many-body methods. Our
results oﬀer the ﬁrst experimental signature of the
persistence of the N = 34 subshell closure below Z = 20,
and agree with shell-model calculations predicting 48Si
as a new doubly magic nucleus far from stability.

even Ar isotopes compared with theory: VS-IMSRG with
the chiral interaction 1.8/2.0(EM) [46, 51, 52] and N2LOsat
[53], coupled-cluster calculations (CC) using the DCE-EOM
and 2PR-EOM methods with the 1.8/2.0(EM) interaction,
and large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculations with the
SDPF-U [56] and the so-called original
[57] and modiﬁed
[30] SDPF-MU interactions. The hatched regions represent
the theoretical uncertainties in coupled-cluster calculations.
Experimental data are taken from Ref. [40, 41] and this work.
Note the broken y-axis scale between 2.2 and 2.7 MeV.

30. The DCE-EOM calculations with the 1.8/2.0 (EM)
interaction reproduce the E(2+
1 ) in 44,48Ar within the
estimated uncertainties, but underestimate the E(2+
1 )
in 52Ar by ∼600 keV. The 2PR-EOM result for 52Ar
is consistent with the DCE-EOM calculation, but fails
to reproduce the steep increase of E(2+
1 ) from 50Ar to
52Ar. We note that 2PR-EOM gives a E(2+
1 ) at 3.0 MeV
for 46Ar, consistent with the N = 28 shell closure but
almost twice the experimental value. For 40Ar, which
is characterized by deformation and shape co-existence
[64], all considered calculations underestimate its E(2+
1 ).
Despite being rooted in the same chiral eﬀective in-
teraction, namely, 1.8/2.0 (EM), the coupled-cluster and
VS-IMSRG approaches predict very diﬀerent behaviours
about the change of E(2+
1 ) from 50Ar to 52Ar. However,
for closed (sub-)shell Ca isotopes, theses two calculations
give consistent results. The diﬀerences in calculated
E(2+
1 ) in neutron-rich Ar isotopes indicate that the
total theoretical uncertainties might be larger than the
estimated error bars shown in Fig. 3. The observed
steep rise of E(2+
1 ) from 50Ar and 52Ar serves as an
important benchmark to understand the uncertainties of
the employed many-body methods.

It is worth noting that the modiﬁed SDPF-MU shell
model calculations and the VS-IMSRG approach using
the 1.8/2.0 (EM) interaction have both been used along
the N = 34 isotonic chain to investigate the shell
