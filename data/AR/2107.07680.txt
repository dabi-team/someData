Abstract

Motivated by homothetic solutions in curvature-driven ﬂows of planar curves, as well as their
many physical applications, this article carries out a systematic study of oriented smooth curves
whose curvature κ is a given function of position or direction. The analysis is informed by a
dynamical systems point of view. Though focussed on situations where the prescribed curvature
depends only on the distance r from one distinguished point, the basic dynamical concepts are
seen to be applicable in other situations as well. As an application, a complete classiﬁcation of
all closed solutions of κ = arb, with arbitrary real constants a, b, is established.

Keywords. Curve shortening ﬂow, planar curve, curvature, net winding, Jordan solution.

Introduction

Modulo rotations and translations, an oriented smooth planar curve is completely determined by
its curvature [10, 20, 27]. Naturally, therefore, curvature plays a central role in the study of
planar shapes. The evolution and characterization of planar shapes has been studied extensively
and in a great variety of contexts, including curve ﬂows [1, 4, 5, 8, 34], growth and abrasion
processes [17, 18, 22, 24], optimization problems [19, 26], among many others. In these contexts,
curvature typically is but one aspect of a more complicated process or model. Leaving aside all
additional layers of complexity, the present article aims at classifying those planar curves whose
curvature simply is a (given) function of position or direction. Formally, given any smooth function
k : U

C is open, it aims at studying all smooth curve solutions Z of

R, where U

In particular, the article asks whether or not (1.1) allows for solutions that have further desirable
properties such as being, for instance, simple, closed, or convex. The main goal is to address
these questions in a systematic way, informed by a dynamical systems point of view. Although
the pertinent dynamical ideas apply in greater generality, for concreteness most of the analysis is

and is independent of N , that is, on

where f : R+
R is a given smooth function. Thus, whereas solving (1.1) amounts to ﬁnding
planar curves with prescribed position- and direction-dependent curvature, in (1.2) the prescribed
curvature only depends on the distance from one distinguished point (namely, the origin).

One key tool in this article is a planar (topological) ﬂow Φf associated with (1.2). Properties
of Φf translate into properties of solutions of (1.2) that may be hard to recognize directly. For a
simple illustration, take for instance f (r) = r4. Figure 1 displays a few solutions of (1.2) in this
case; see also the illustrations in [34]. As it turns out, the family of all (maximal) solutions of

One prominent natural source for (1.1) are curvature-driven curve ﬂows which continue to be
studied for their deep mathematical properties as well as their broad physical applications. Consider
for example the Andrews–Bloore ﬂow generated by

∂t

(a + κb)N ;

(1.4)

here (Zt)0≤t<T with the appropriate T > 0 describes a parametrized family of oriented simple closed
smooth curves, and a, b
0 are real constants. Curve ﬂows such as Andrews–Bloore have been
suggested as simple models for a variety of physical processes, ranging from the growth of crystal
surfaces to the abrasion of pebbles. As detailled in [22], some aspects of the dynamics of (1.4) in
general remain a challenge, both mathematically and computationally. However, important special
cases, including b = 0 (also referred to as the eikonal ﬂow), a = 0, b = 1 (the curve-shortening
ﬂow), and a = 0, b = 1
3 (the aﬃne curve-shortening ﬂow), are now well understood; see, e.g.,
[1, 4, 5, 34] and the many references therein. Since they may represent limiting or equilibrium
shapes, homothetic solutions, i.e., solutions Zt that are mere t-dependent rescalings of one ﬁxed
curve Z, play a key role in any analysis of (1.4). Assume for instance that Zt(s) = ϕ(t)Z(s), with
= 0,
ϕ : [0, T [

and Z is a solution of

R+, is a solution of (1.4) with a = 0. Then ˙ϕ = λϕ−b for some real constant λ

While the (counter-clockwise oriented) circle with radius

solves (1.5), it is much less obvious whether or not any other (simple closed) solutions exist. In
essence, this question is answered in [5] by means of an ad-hoc analysis, with the answer depending
on b in a non-trivial way. Note that (1.5) has the form (1.1). Towards the end of the present article,
it will become clear that an analysis similar to, but simpler than the one presented here can be
carried out, for instance, when k in (1.1) depends only on Re (ZN ), a scenario that includes (1.5).

(rescaled) limiting shapes of a curvature-driven abrasion process on pebbles, say, then such an
interpretation, however physically questionable it may be in other respects, would at least be
consistent with the well-documented empirical observation that shapes of worn stones are not
exactly elliptical either, but rather appear to be a bit bulkier [17, 18, 23, 24].

Organization and notation

This article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the planar ﬂow Φf associated with (1.2)
and discusses a few of its basic properties. Section 3 establishes the crucial correspondance between
the dynamics of Φf on the one hand and solutions of (1.2) on the other. For a reasonably wide
class of smooth functions f , Section 4 characterizes simple closed solutions of (1.2) and provides
tools to ﬁnd all such solutions, or else to prove that none exist. Section 5 employs the machinery
developed in earlier sections for an in-depth study of the monomial family f (r) = rb, where b is
an arbitrary real constant. A concluding supplemental section illustrates how the analysis, though

3

quite speciﬁc and delicate, nonetheless is representative of arguments and techniques that can be
applied to other classes of functions in (1.2), as well as variants thereof; as such, it is quite similar
in spirit to analyses in, e.g., [5, 9, 29, 37].

Remark 2.8. By its very deﬁnition (2.5), the function ωf bears some resemblance to the minimal
period function Tf . The literature on minimal periods in Hamiltonian systems, notably near non-
degenerate centers, is substantial; see, e.g., [9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 31, 35, 36, 38] and the many
references therein. The author does not know whether these ﬁne studies can fruitfully be applied
for the purpose of the present article, and in particular whether a multiple of ωf can be interpreted
as the true period in a 1-DOF Hamiltonian ﬂow. Usage of ωf in later sections may also remind the
reader of the basic diﬀerential geometry notions of total curvature and rotation index [10, 20, 27, 28].
Unlike the latter, however, the value of ωf need not be an integer but can in fact be any (extended)
real number.

For the analysis in later sections, it is crucial whether or not ωf attains certain particular values.

As alluded to already in the Introduction, the main objective of this article is to systematically
study all (maximal) solutions of (3.1). This is accomplished by making these solutions correspond
to the orbits of the planar ﬂow Φf introduced in the previous section. To establish such a corre-
spondance, notice ﬁrst that for a smooth path c : Jc →
C parametrized by arc length, (3.1) with
p = eiϑ

S1 simply reads

˙c = p ,
= 0. While this may be read as an ODE on C× ×

S1, the dimension of the latter
provided that c
phase space can actually be reduced with very little eﬀort. Speciﬁcally, given c, associate with it
the smooth path zc : Jc →

provided that c(t)
is a solution of (2.1), an ODE on C×. It is the purpose of this section to demonstrate that the
correspondance c
zc indeed enables the systematic study of (3.1) by way of Φf . A ﬁrst simple
observation in this regard is that most solutions of (3.1) can be reconstructed from the corresponding
orbit of Φf ; the routine proof is left to the interested reader, as are the proofs of several equally
elementary observations below.

Remark 3.2. Arguably, (3.2) might be more natural still if it were made the deﬁnition of zc rather
than of zc, a modiﬁcation that would not aﬀect the substance of the subsequent analysis. However,
the speciﬁc form of (3.2) has been chosen in order to ensure that, in all relevant situations, the
paths c and zc have the same orientation; see, for instance, the proof of Lemma 3.10 below.

c is equivalent to c and Q

With Propositions 2.1 and 3.3, every solution

of (3.1) corresponds to a uniquely determined
Φf -orbit, namely Φf
, and it is easily seen that every Φf -orbit, with the possible exception
of Φf (R, 0), can be obtained that way. Moreover, by Proposition 3.3 a Φf -conjugate orbit is obtained
O(2). Leaving aside trivial exceptions, a stronger statement can
if
be made that has the additional beneﬁt of being reversible.

Notice that in the setting of Theorem 3.13, i.e., with f satisfying (3.7), the function ω∗
as seen in the proof, and hence the otherwise unwieldy condition (3.8) holds automatically.

4 Jordan solutions and monotone net winding

By Lemma 3.8, closed (maximal) solutions of (3.1) are plentiful unless ωf is constant on Per Φf \
Fix Φf . By contrast, Lemma 3.10 and Example 3.12 suggest that Jordan solutions are much rarer.
In fact, as detailed in this section and the next, Jordan solutions of (3.1) are exceedingly rare for
many f . Though much of the analysis could be carried out, at least locally, for far more general
f , assume from now on that the smooth function f : R+
R satisﬁes (3.7). This allows Lemma
2.9 and Theorem 3.13 to be applied together. By Theorem 3.13, clearly (3.1) has at least as many
diﬀerent (circular) Jordan solutions as Ff has elements. For instance, Ff = R+ for f (s) = 1/s,
and correspondingly every (counter-clockwise oriented) circle centered at 0 is a Jordan solution; see
Example 2.12(ii). To rule out degenerate situations like this, and thus to make the ultimate results

(ii) A variant of Lemma 4.9 holds for decreasing f

this case also, the right-hand side in (4.4) has to be replaced by the trivial lower bound 1

As a consequence, the right-hand side in (4.2) has to be divided by √2, resulting in a lower bound
for ωf (s) that typically is not sharp anywhere.

which the next section is going to provide ample evidence.

5 An example: The monomial family

This ﬁnal section applies the results of the preceding sections to the monomials fb(s) = sb, with
R. Naturally, the analysis is quite speciﬁc to that particular family of functions, though the
b
techniques applied here likely are useful also when dealing with other classes of functions. Moreover,
the section illustrates how applying the results of the present article, notably Theorem 4.11, though
quite trivial in theory, may nonetheless pose a considerable challenge in practice. This is not an
uncommon situation: The reader likely is familiar with similar, seemingly simple problems in non-
linear analysis that also require for their resolution lengthy, potentially delicate and unenlightening
computations; see, for instance, [1, 9, 29, 37].

Remark 5.7. As mentioned already in the Introduction, it is a well-documented empirical obser-
vation that the oval shapes of worn stones never seem to be exact ellipses, but rather appear to be
a bit bulkier. In this regard, the reader may ﬁnd it interesting to note that none of the non-circular

Supplement: The limiting shapes in [5] revisited

As noted earlier, the results of this section are quite speciﬁc to the monomial family. However,
the basic tools developed earlier in order to obtain these results, notably the auxiliary planar ﬂow
Φf (Section 2), geometric correspondances (Section 3), and analytic estimates (Section 4), all may
be useful in other contexts as well. This supplementary section brieﬂy describes one such context,
motivated by the classiﬁcation of limiting shapes for isotropic curve ﬂows in [5]. As the author
intends to give a detailed account elsewhere, only an outline is presented here that highlights the
similarity to the main results of the present article; as such, a few non-essential assumptions are
made to simplify the exposition.

and orbits of Ψg on the other hand. (A careful analysis needs to pay attention to the possibility of

This usage of the symbol s∗ is slightly inconsistent with its earlier usage. However, rather than
confusing the reader, it will hopefully highlight the parallels between the analyses of (3.1) and
(5.20), respectively. Note that (5.21), though very similar in spirit to (4.1), is considerably simpler,
in at least two respects: On the one hand, utilizing the smooth positive function K := G/(G′)2,
together with (a trivially adjusted version of) Proposition 4.14, yields

νg(s) is monotone whenever K is convex or concave [9, 11, 13, 29, 37]. Applying Proposition
4.14 once more yields, for every 0 < s < sg,

iG′( Re w) ,

(5.24)

−
which has sg as a non-degenerate center; cf. [5, Sec. 2]. This interpretation makes νg directly
amenable to the substantial literature on 1-DOF Hamiltonian systems, notably on the periods of
such systems; see, e.g., [9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 31, 35, 36, 38]. By contrast, much of the delicate analysis
from Proposition 4.7 onward has been necessitated by the fact that no similar interpretation seems
to exist for ωf ; see also Remark 2.8.

Finally, to illustrate the above for a familiar example, consider once again the monomial family,

In other words, the center 1 of (5.24) is isochronous for g = f3. This “surprising aﬃne invariance
property”[5] reﬂects the fact that the phase portrait of (5.24) for g = f3 is invariant under the
i Im z of Af3 . Further analysis shows that every orbit Ψf3(R, s)

R+ corresponds to a (counter-clockwise oriented) ellipse with semi-axes s, 1/s. Thus, every

Acknowledgements

The author was partially supported by an Nserc Discovery Grant. He owes deep gratitude to
T.P. Hill and K.E. Morrison who in 2005 conjectured (correctly, as it turned out) that the only
Jordan solution of κ = r is the (counter-clockwise oriented) unit circle, and who greatly helped this
work come to fruition through continued interest and advice. Insightful comments by an anonymous
referee led to a much improved presentation. Thanks also to J. Muldowney, M. Niksirat, T. Schmah,
