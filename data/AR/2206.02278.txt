Abstract

Change detection is an important synthetic aperture radar (SAR) application, usually used to detect changes on the
ground scene measurements in different moments in time. Traditionally, change detection algorithm (CDA) is mainly de-
signed for two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images retrieved at different instants. However, more images can be used to
improve the algorithms performance, witch emerges as a research topic on SAR change detection. Image stack information
can be treated as a data series over time and can be modeled by autoregressive (AR) models. Thus, we present some initial
ﬁndings on SAR change detection based on image stack considering AR models. Applying AR model for each pixel position in
the image stack, we obtained an estimated image of the ground scene which can be used as a reference image for CDA. The
experimental results reveal that ground scene estimates by the AR models is accurate and can be used for change detection
applications.

1 Introduction

Autoregressive (AR) models can be used to describe random processes, for example time-varying processes in nature. The

output of an AR model is a prediction based on the temporal statistical characteristics of a given time-varying process [2,6].

AR models are used in statistics and signal processing applications, such as in [1, 6, 9, 13]. In this study, an AR model is

considered in the context of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection.

The SAR change detection algorithm (CDA) refers to the methods used to detect changes in a ground scene between

distinct measurement in time. The changes on the ground scene can be the result of either natural disasters like ﬂood and

wildﬁre or man-made interference, such as deforestation and installations [5, 14, 16]. SAR change detection is a common

method of detecting changes in SAR images (reference and surveillance) over the same area, but at different instants. The

requirements for such measurements are that the passes, the heading angles of the platform, and the incident angles, are

almost identical [11].

The idea of multi-pass SAR change detection based on image stack was brought up recently [17]. The idea comes

from the fact that with two (or more) reference radar images instead of one, more knowledge on ground clutter can be

retrieved. This knowledge is used to eliminate clutter and noise in the surveillance image that can enhance CDA results.

One of the initial study on this topic is presented in [17], where a small stack with three images is experimented. The

aim is to minimize the false alarm rate caused by the clutter especially when elongated structures such as power lines

and fences are considered in the SAR scene. Two out of three images without change are used to calculate the statistics

of the clutter. The surveillance image with changes is placed into the output of an adaptive noise canceler (ANC) and the

difference image is used as a reference signal. Experimental results indicate that the process with small image stacks can

reduce signiﬁcantly the incidence of false alarms and provide a high probability of detection. Based on the same stack size,

a change detection method is proposed in [17]. The method is based on the analysis of the distribution obtained by the

differences between two images without change (simply obtained by a subtraction) [11]. As shown in [11], the distribution

is very close to a Gaussian process. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) based on the Neyman-Pearson lemma can be easily

obtained with the bivariate Gaussian probability density function which plays a signiﬁcant role in the proposed change

detection method [17].

For large image stacks, composed of more than three images, and based on the assumption that the heading angles

of the platform and the incident angles of the multi-passes are identical, not only the knowledge on ground clutter is

retrieved. In theory, the whole ground scene can be predicted accurately. By using an AR model, it is possible to describe

the changes in the measurements that occur in the ground scene over time. Thus, it is possible to get the prediction of

the true ground scene without change. Once the prediction of the ground scene without change is available, the changes

in the ground scene can be easily detected. In this paper, we present an initial study on ground scene prediction by using

AR models for SAR image stacks. The data used in this study consist of eight SAR images obtained by the CARABAS II

system [10].

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the time series model considered in this study. Section 3 details

the ground estimation technique considered in this paper. Section 4 presents the data description and experimental results.

Concluding remarks are in Section 5.

2 Autoregressive model

Let y[n] be an N-point time-series indexed over n = 1, 2, . . . , N. With the analysis of a stationary series, it is possible to

extract information on time series data, e.g., statistics; whereas time series forecasting uses time series models to predict

the future data based on the previous data [4]. In this study, the AR model for time series is considered, which can be

expressed by [7]

y[n] = −

p
(cid:88)

k=1

a[k]y[n − k] + u[n],

(1)

where y[n] is the amplitude value of each pixel in one image, a[k] are the autoregressive terms, u[n] is white noise,

and p is the order of the model [8]. The autoregressive terms a[k] in Equation (1) can be estimated by the Yule-Walker
estimator [4]. Hence, the estimated autoregressive terms (cid:98)a[k] are the solutions of the following equation system

In the next section, we use the AR model for a stack of eight SAR images to forecasting the ground reference image.

3 Ground estimation for change detection

Basically, CDA requires two images (reference and surveillance) associated with exactly two measurements. The pro-

cessing sequence includes change detection and change classiﬁcation or false alarm minimization. Conceptually, change

detection can be simply obtained by a subtraction of the reference image with the surveillance image, followed by thresh-

olding.

However, recent studies have shown that image stacks can be used to improve the performance of change detection [17].

The stack should be composed by images with the same heading and incident angle. In this study we consider a stack

composed of eight images with the same ground scene with four different targets positions.

In the signal processing point of view, an image stack can be viewed as a time series, since it is a series of data indexed

over the time. It is natural to apply time series analysis and time series forecasting for information extraction and obtain

prediction data. With the goal of change detection, the information extraction can concern the statistics of SAR image

stack while the information prediction can be the ground scene estimation.

Based on the AR model presented in the previous section, it is possible to obtain a ground estimation of the images. The

used images in the stack are assumed to be perfectly co-registered. The image samples extracted from the stack of images

are illustrated in Figure 1 and they form a time series that is placed into an AR model. The extraction and prediction are

applied to the pixel positions. As a result, we obtain a true image of the ground scene illuminated by multi-pass.

Once the predicted image is available, it can be used, for example, as a reference image for change detection. In this

case, the changes of the ground scene before the ﬁrst pass and the latter passes can be detected. To evaluate this proposal,

we performed a simple processing sequence for the stack of images including ground estimation, change detection and

change classiﬁcation, as shown in Figure 2.

The stack of images is used as input of the AR model, which provides a ground reference image. Then, each image used

in the stack is compared to the reference image, resulting in difference images. The processing is followed by thresholding

given rise to a binary image. The last processing step is reserved for morphological operations such as erosion and dilation.

For the experiments, we performed an erosion followed by a dilatation.

The measures of performance of change detection is based on the probability of detection (Pd) and false alarm rate
(FAR). The quantity Pd is obtained from the ratio between the number of detected targets and the total numbers of known
targets, and FAR is deﬁned by the number of false alarms detected per square kilometer [10].

4 Experimental results

In this section we provide some experimental results to assess the performance obtained by the processing scheme pre-

sented in Section 3 by considering predicted images as ground estimation input.

4.1 Data description

The data used for this study were delivered by CARABAS II [10], a Swedish ultra-wideband VHF SAR system. The data

included eight images with almost identical ﬂight geometry, but with four different targets deployments in the ground

scene [10,15]. All information about the data can be found in [10,15]. In this paper, we consider the image stack generated

by passes ﬁve and six and missions one to four for each pass. Figures 3 and 4 present eight CARABAS II images forming
the image stack used in the AR model. Each image is represented by a matrix of 3000 × 2000 pixels, corresponding to an
area of 6 km2. The ground scene is dominated by forest with pine trees. Fences, power lines and roads were also present in

the scene. Some military vehicles were deployed in the SAR scene and placed in a manner to facilitate their identiﬁcations

in the tests [10]. The targets can be seen in the upper-left corner in Figures 3(a), 3(b), 4(a), and 4(b); and in the lower-right

corner in Figures 3(c), 3(d), 4(c), and 4(d). In Figures 3 and 4 it is possible to identify the targets and other structures, like

roads and power lines. Each image has 25 targets with three different sizes [10].

4.2 Ground estimation

In this study we considered the AR model presented in Section 2. The resolution of the CARABAS II system is approxi-
mately 3 × 3 m2. Since a pixel represents a 1 × 1 m2, considering an one-dimensional model, the closest pixels will be more
correlated than the others. Thus, we used p = 1 in the AR models. Based on the ﬁtted model, we obtained the forecast of

one step ahead for each pixel, like showed in Equation (2). This forecasting provides a new image presented in Figure 5

representing the ground estimation of the SAR scene.

We can visually compare the images considered for the ground estimation (showed in Figures 3 and 4), and the ground

estimation (the new image presented in Figure 5). Hence, we can verify the lake regions, the forest, and strong scatters in

all images. However, the deployed vehicles in the missions, that can be veriﬁed in different locations in Figures 3 and 4,

do not appear in Figure 5. With visual veriﬁcation, Figure 5 seems to present a good estimation of the ground scene.

Figure 6 presents the image with the absolute estimative values of the autoregressive terms of the AR(1) model. The

black points in the image correspond to the lowest values. It is possible to see (in the boxes) the regions where the vehicles

were deployed in some instants in time more highlighted than the other structures in the image. Thus, the AR model

reduce the amplitude of the targets in the ground estimation. In future studies, this image can be used to indicate the

changes in the ground scene.

Figures 7 and 8 present the images obtained by the subtraction between the image of interest and the ground estima-

tion image obtained by the AR(1) model. We can see that the deployed vehicles are more highlighted in Figures 7 and 8.

Only in Figure 7(b) we can verify the strong scatters in the greater prominence. In all other images, the strong scatters

were almost completely removed.

4.3 Application in change detection

We consider CDA as an application to the obtained ground estimation. The change detection is realized according to the

processing scheme presented in Figure 2. The AR model gives the ground estimation presented in Figure 5. With the

estimated image of the ground scene, we performed subtractions between the interest images and the obtained images as

given in Figures 7 and 8. The next step is reserved for thresholding and morphological operations to obtain the change

detection results. Figure 9 presents the histogram for Figure 7(a). We can see that the magnitude distribution of the

images obtained by the subtraction between the interest image and the ground estimation image is approximately a

normal distribution.

Thus, the thresholding can be choosing as

C =

where C is the detection constant, (cid:98)
For evaluation, the values 4.5; 5; 5.5; 6; 6.5 are selected for C.

µ is the mean, and (cid:98)

σ the standard deviation of the considered pixels in the image stack.

Table 1 presents the change detection results for C = 4.5. We detect 188 deployed vehicles with 33 false alarms, i.e., the
detection probability is 94% while the false alarm rate is only 0.69/km2. In these same images, in [10], it was detected 188

vehicles with 52 false alarms. Hence, considering the AR model to estimate the ground scene, we obtained the same

number of detected vehicles with less 19 false alarms than [10].

Especially, the change detection results for mission four and pass ﬁve is two false alarms in comparison to 29 in [10]

(one less detection). Among the 33 false alarms presented in Table 1, 24 of them are related to the images in Figures 7(b)

and 8(d). Other approaches to ground estimation and other values of p can be further investigated to provide more accurate

predicted SAR images.

Figure 10 presents the ROC curve [12] of the change detection results, showing the probability of detection versus the
false alarm rate for different values of threshold. We can observe in the ROC curve values of Pd = 0.92 with FAR = 0.42 or
Pd = 0.90 with FAR = 0.35, as examples.

5 Conclusion

Usually, AR models are used in the study of data that are deﬁned in the time domain. In this paper we proposed the

use of an AR(1) model for a stack of eight SAR images to retrieve a ground scene estimation. By using this technique,

it was possible to obtain a reliable representation of the ground scene, which could be used as a reference image in a

change detection algorithm. We applied subtractions between the ground estimation image obtained by AR models and

the interest images. With simple thresholding and morphological operations, we obtained competitive results of Pd and
FAR when compared to the results presented in [10].

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst treatment for ground estimation with image stack by using AR models. In

future studies, we intend to use stacks with more images generating possibly more accurate adjustments and consequently

more reliable forecasts or more accurate ground estimation.
