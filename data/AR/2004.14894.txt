On the Relationship Between Transit Time of ICMEs and Strength of the 
Initiated Geomagnetic Storms 

 I.M. Chertok1 

Abstract      More  than  140  isolated  non-recurrent  geomagnetic  storms  (GMSs)  of  various 
intensities from extreme to weak are considered, which are reliably identified with solar eruptive 
sources (coronal mass ejections, CMEs). The analysis aims to obtain a possibly complete picture 
of the relationship between the transit time of propagation of CMEs and interplanetary coronal 
mass ejections (ICMEs) from the Sun to the Earth (more precisely, the time interval Δtp from the 
moment of an eruption until the peak of the corresponding GMS) and the maximum intensity of 
this  GMS,  as  measured  by  the  disturbance  storm  time  geomagnetic  index  Dst.  Two  groups  of 
events are singled out: one includes GMSs, the source of which was an eruption from an active 
region  (AR  events),  the  other  GMSs  caused  by  filament  eruptions  from  quiescent  areas  of  the 
Sun  located  outside  ARs  (QS  events).  The  distribution  of  the  large  number  of  the  analyzed 
events on a Δtp – Dst plane confirms and substantially clarifies the known regularities. The AR 
events are characterized by a shorter transit time (Δtp ≈ 1–4 days) and much stronger GMSs (Dst 
up to –600 nT mainly) in comparison with the QS events (Δtp ≈ 3–5 days, Dst > –200 nT). For 
events  of  both  groups,  the  shorter  transit  time  of  CMEs/ICMEs,  the  more  intense  GMSs;  in 
particular, for AR events when Δtp declines from 4 to 1 day, Dst decreases on average from –100 
to  –470  nT  and  can  reach  –  900  nT.  From  the  point  of  view  of  the  nature  of  GMSs  and  their 
sources  on  the  Sun,  the  obtained  results  mean  that  both  the  speed  of  CMEs/ICMEs  and  the 
strength  of  the  magnetic  field  transferred  by them  are  largely  determined  by  the  parameters  of 
the corresponding eruptions, in particular, by the eruptive magnetic flux and the released energy.

1. Introduction 

technological  systems, 

Among  space  weather  disturbances  that  have  a  serious  impact  on  the  Earth's  environment  and 
including  satellites,  power  grids,  communications,  and 
modern 
navigation, solar energetic particle (SEP) events and geomagnetic storms (GMSs) are the most 
significant    (e.g.  reviews  by  Gopalswamy,  Tsurutani,  and  Yan,  2015;  Kilpua,  Koskinen  ,  and 
Pulkkinen, 2017; Gopalswamy, 2018).  SEPs are accelerated in solar flares and coronal shocks 
driven  by  high-speed  coronal  mass  ejections  (CMEs),  observed  in  the  solar  corona  with  the 
white-light  ground-based  and  space-based  coronagraphs.  Relatively  weak  recurrent  GMSs  are 
related  to  so-called  corotating  interaction  regions  (SIRs)  formed  when  high-speed  streams  of 
solar wind from coronal holes collide with the slower background wind.

In this article, we deal with the most significant non-recurrent GMSs which are initiated by 
CMEs  and  their  interplanetary  counterparts  (ICMEs).  Most  of  such  GMSs  are  caused  by  the 
front-sided halo  CMEs originated  from significant eruptions in the central sector of the visible 
solar  disk  (Gosling,  1993;  Webb  and  Howard  2012;  Gopalswamy,  2016;  Ameri  and  Valtonen, 
2017,  and  references  therein).  Two  types  of  eruptions,  associated  CMEs/ICMEs,  and  resulting 
non-recurrent  GMSs  should  be  distinguished.  The  largest  of  them  are  usually  associated  with 
powerful  flares  and  (when  a  filament  is  present)  concomitant  filament  eruptions  occurring  in 
active regions (ARs) with their strong, complicated, and evolving magnetic fields. We will refer 
to this type of events as AR-associated or simply AR events. Noticeable but less intense GMSs 
are generated when CMEs occur as a result of erupting or disappearing solar filaments (DSFs) 
located in quiescent regions outside ARs. Following Zhang et al. (2007a), the non-AR events of 
this type we will mark as QS, i.e. quiet-Sun filament eruptions. For both AR and QS eruptions 
two  factors  are  decisive  for  the  occurrence  of  a  significant  GMS:  (a)  a  perfect  hit  of  ICMEs 
(magnetic  clouds  or  general  ejecta)  on  the  Earth’s  magnetosphere,  (b)  the  presence  of  a 
sufficiently strong and prolonged south-oriented (negative) Bz component of the magnetic field, 
either in a ICME-driven shock and sheath region or in the ejecta body itself (see Manchester et 
al., 2017; Gopalswamy, 2018). 

From  the  scientific  and  forecasting  points  of  view,  the  most  important  parameters  of  non-
recurrent GMSs are the maximum strength of the storm and its onset and peak times. In general, 
it  is  known  that  stronger  GMSs  occur  earlier.    This  tendency  follows,  in  particular,  from  the 
results of a number of studies of some restricted sets of events that show that the GMS intensity 
enhances with an increase in the initial speed of the corresponding CMEs in the inner corona and 
with  a  decrease  of  the  ICME  transit  time  from  the  Sun  to  the  Earth  (e.g.  Srivastava  and 
Venkatakrishnan, 2004; Lefèvre et al., 2016; Dumbović et al., 2016). Herewith, the time interval 
between a solar eruption and GMS onset manifested by a sudden storm commencement (SSC), 
Δt0, was mainly used as the transit time. It was noted additionally that GMSs associated with QS 
eruptions are characterized as a whole by a weaker strength and larger time delay of their GMS 
onset  in  comparison  with  GMSs  initiated  by  AR  eruptions  (Cliver  et  al.,  2009;  Dave    et  al., 
2018). Moreover, it is known that the most severe GMSs, including the largest Carrington event 
of  September  1859  and    other  historical  superstorms,  had  the  shortest  time  delays  to  the  solar 
eruptive  flares,  being  it  of  up  to  17  hours  (Cliver  and  Svalgaard,  2004;  Cliver  and  Dietrich, 
2013). It may be added that Chertok et al. (2013) determined reversed dependencies of the GMS 
strength and transit time on the CME-caused eruptive magnetic flux of extreme ultraviolet 
dimmings and post-eruption arcades and, on this basis, also concluded that short transit times are 
typical of the most intense GMSs.   

This article aims to study the relationship between the GMS strength and the solar-Earth 
transit time in a more detailed and complete way using the entire sample of accessible data on 
GMSs of different strengths and their solar sources, from extreme events of the Carrington type 
to moderate and weak GMSs. Overall, our analysis covers the period from 1859 to 2018. We will 
characterize the GMS strength by the disturbance storm time, Dst, geomagnetic index (Sugiura 
and Kamei, 1991). For historical events, the minimum Dst value was estimated by geomagnetic 
magnetometer records available at that time and by the low-latitude boundary of the auroral oval 
(see Cliver and Svalgaard, 2004; Hapgood, 2019). Since 1957, the Dst index has been compiled 
regularly.    Unlike  previous  studies,  instead  of  the  Δt0  onset  transit  time,  we  will  consider  an 
interval  between  the  flare  maximum  in  the  optics  and  soft  X-rays  (or  the  time  of  the  CME 
eruption) and the moment of the GMS peak (the minimum of the Dst index), i.e. the peak transit 
time,  Δtp.  The  large  sample  of  the  analyzed  events  is  described  in  Section  2.  In  Section  3,  the 
generalized relationships between Δtp and Dst are presented both for AR and QS events.  Section 
4 is devoted to the summary and discussion.

2. Data 

We  consider  isolated  (i.e.  undistorted  by  previous  events)  storms  for  which  the  estimated  or 
measured Dst index is known and which are reliably enough, or with high probability, identified 
with  a  concrete  solar  eruptive  source.  The  corresponding  event  number,  date  and  time  of  the 
GMS peak, minimum Dxt index value, day, time, and type of a parent eruption, calculated transit 
peak time, as well as notes and references are presented in Table 1. We limited ourselves only to 
these  parameters  and  do  not  provide  other  supporting  information,  in  particular,  such  as  the 
coordinates of eruptive flares and filaments, since the bulk of the events were related to sources 
in the central sector of the disk restricted by heliolongitudes ±45°. This information can be found 
in the given references. Some rare exceptions to this rule are noted by a superscript "с" in Table 
1. 

We formed our ensemble of events from different available sources. In order to consider a 
wide range of the GMS intensities, we included not only extreme events of the space era that are 
well  provided  with  observational  data,  but  also  historical  superstorms.  A  collection  of  such 
superstorms with Dst <–250 nT for 1859–2004 and their solar sources was listed and commented 
by  Cliver  and  Crooker  (1993),  Cliver  and  Svalgaard  (2004),  Cliver  et  al.  (2009)  (see  also 
references  therein).  Additionally,  we  checked  the  selected  events  with  the  solar  data  related  to 
historical extreme GMSs in the range 1868–2010 and the space era presented by Gonzalez et al. 
(2011) and Lefèvre  et al. (2016)  (see also Joselyn and McIntosh, 1981, Tsurutani et al., 1992). 
Our  analysis  is  based  also  on  the  catalog  of  major  GMSs  prepared  by  the  Living  with  a  Star 
(LWS) Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW; Zhang et al., 2007a,b), that contains data 
on  the  most  intense  GMSs  with  a  minimum  Dst  <  −100  nT  and  their  solar  sources  occurred 
during Solar Cycle 23 (1996–2005). We took into account some corrections to this catalog made 
by  Chertok  et  al.  (2013).  The  weak  Cycle  24  was  accompanied  by  a  small  number  of    major 
GMSs  with  Dst  <  −100  nT,  a  list  of  which  up  to  June  2014  can  be  found,  for  example,  in 
Gopalswamy, Tsurutani, and Yan (2015). Later, the sample of such events was supplemented by 
other eight major GMSs listed at the bottom of Table 1, the last of which, but the third largest 
GMS  of  Cycle  24,  took  place  near  its  minimum  on  26  August  2018  (see  Li,  Luhmann,  and 
Lynch,  2018;  Abunin  et  al.,  2020;  Chen  et  al.,  2019  ).  Concerning  low-intensity  events,  we 
found and included in the analysis about 35 randomly selected isolated and moderate (−50 ≤ Dst 
<  −100  nT)  GMSs  with  a  sufficiently  reliable  identification  of  the  solar  source.  For  this,  we 
analyzed

When calculating the peak transit time, Δtp, the eruption moment is well determined with 
an accuracy of ±1 hr. If there were no CME observations, in particular, for historical events, the 
time of maximum of optical or soft X-ray flares was taken as the eruption time.  When the CME 
data  were  available,  the  information  on  the  first  appearance  of  a  CME  and  its  height-time 
trajectory, presented in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog cited above, was used.

As  a  measure  of  the  GMS  intensity,  the  Dst  index  is  used  throughout  this  article,  which 
started to be constructed and published only since 1957 (Sugiura and Kamei, 1991). Recall that 
the  hourly  Dst  index  is  calculated  from  measurements  of  the  H  component  of  the  field  (the 
horizontal intensity of the magnetic field vector) at four low-latitude geomagnetic observatories 
and characterizes the effect of the magnetospheric global equatorial ring current. We proceeded 
from  the  final  (1957–2014),  provisional  (2015–2016),  and  real-time  values  of  Dst  index 
presented  at  the  World  Data  Center  for  Geomagnetism,  Kyoto  (http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-
u.ac.jp/Dstdir/index.html).  For  earlier  and  historical  events  we  use  the  Dst  index  estimated  by 
different  authors,  based  on  available  magnetogram  records,  worldwide  low-latitude  auroral 
extent, and other relevant data (see Cliver and Dietrich (2013) for details). 

Among  historical  superintense  and  extreme  GMSs,  the  type  of  a  solar  source  (AR  or  QS)  is 
reliably  known  for  a  small  number  of  events,  particularly  from  the  studies  of  Joselyn  and 
McIntosh (1981), Cliver and Crooker (1993),   Cliver et al. (2009), and others. For some of those 
events, their relation either to AR-associated flares or to eruptive filaments outside ARs remains 
uncertain. One of the reasons is the lack of complete observations of the Sun in the pre-space era. 
Another category of uncertain events are the so-called intermediate filament eruptions (e.g. Zou 
et  al.,  2019).  In  such  eruptions,  driving  usually  quite  high-speed  CMEs,  one  filament  leg  is 
rooted in AR and another leg is located in a nearby quiet region, or lie between neighboring ARs. 
For both types of  intense GMSs with uncertain and intermediate solar source association,  we 
accepted that they were caused by AR eruptions as the most plausible origin.  

Some remarks should be made regarding several of the analyzed events. Initial estimates 
indicated an extra large strength of the Carrington  GMS of 1859 (event 1 in Table 1) up to Dst  
≈  –1760  nT.  However,  a  more  detailed  and  complete  analysis  of  various  data  and  lines  of 
evidence, including a probable ionospheric contribution, reviewed by Cliver and Dietrich (2013) 
resulted  also  in  an  extreme  but  more  modest  value  Dst    ≈  –900  nT.  We  use  just  this  GMS 
intensity  and  the  peak  transit  time  Δtp  ≈  18  hr  determined  using  the  presented  H-component  
magnetometer record. 

The  extreme  15  May  1921  GMS    (event  4)  can  be  regarded  as  a  rival  of  the  Carrington 
event.  Hapgood  (2019)  reviewed  available  solar  and  geophysical  data  and  reconstructed  the 
timeline and scale of the May 1921 event. Following his work, we accepted that this superstorm 
was initiated by the flare eruption from a large near-central AR on 14 May (SOL1921-05-14T07) 
and the storm intensity also attained Dst ≈ –900 nT. 

Vaisberg  and  Zastenker  (1976)  determined  the  optical  3B-class  flare  of  4  August  1972 
(SOL1972-08-04T06:40) as the source of the moderate GMS (Dst  ≈ –125 nT) that peaked on 5 
August (event 25) and assigned a fast Sun-Earth travel time of about 15 hr for the corresponding 
interplanetary shock. We believe that this is not the case because the most probable source of this 
GMS  was  the  H-alpha  3N-class  flare  on  2  August  (SOL1972-08-02T04:10)  from  the  same 
central  AR.  The  three  combined  flares  of  4  August  probably  contributed  to  the  subsequent 
moderate GMSs that occurred 5–6 August.   

The  famous  most  powerful  GMS  of  the  space  era,  that  picked  on  14  March  1989  (event 
34), has been associated usually with a series of solar eruptions from a large central AR between 
10 and 12 March. According to Gopalsvamy et al. (2018) and Boteler (2019), the peak of this 
storm  is  attributed  to  the  M7.3-class  flare,  which  occurred  on  12  March  (SOL1989-03-
12T00:16). Therefore, if so, its peak transit time is Δtp ≈ 50 hr that is still quite large for a storm 
of Dst ≈ –589 nT.

As  an  exception,  we  included  in  our  consideration  the  outstanding  event  121  associated 
with a far behind the limb eruption on 23 July 2012 (SOL2012-07-23T02:36), which was well 
observed  by  the  favorably  located  STEREO-A  (Solar  Terrestrial  Relations  Observatory) 
spacecraft. The initiated ICME arrived at STEREO-A in a very short transit time of 19–21 hr and 
brought  to  1  AU  a  recorded  strong  interplanetary  magnetic  field  of  109  nT  with  a  sustained 
southward Bz component. According to modeling estimations by Liu et al. (2014) (see also Baker 
et al., 2013), if it had been directed toward Earth, this ICME might have caused a GMS with a 
minimum Dst index between −1150 and −600 nT that is comparable to the Carrington storm of 
1859. We took the average Dst ≈ –900 nT and the peak transit time Δtp ≈ 27 hr.

standard statistical deviations. 

A  series  of  events  was  not  included  in  our  consideration  since  the  corresponding  GMSs 
occurred  against  a  strongly  disturbed  and  intense  background  from  a  previous  storm  and  their 
real strength was not determined unambiguously by a relevant solar eruption. Examples of such 
overlapping events are the fairly intense GMSs of 5 and 23 September 1957 (Dst ≈ = –324 and 
303 nT), 1 April and 7 October 1960 (Dst ≈ = –327 and –287 nT), 13 April 1981 (Dst ≈ = –311 
nT), 9 February 1986 (Dst ≈ = –307 nT), and others. 

The  preprint of Hayakawa  et al. (2020) has just been  published  with an  analysis of the 
extreme  GMS  on  31  October  1903.  We  added  it  at  the  end  of  Table1  as  event  143  and  we 
included it in our study.  

3. Results 

The distribution of the minimal geomagnetic Dst index versus the peak transit time, Δtp, for the 
analyzed large collection of events is presented in Figure 1. This plot confirms and clarifies the 
basic regularities mentioned in the Introduction. At first, the QS-associated GMSs (red circles) as 
a whole are characterized by the longer peak transit time and lower intensity in comparison with 
the  AR-driven  storms  (blue  circles).  A  noticeable  part  of  QS  GSMs  peaked  only  over  5  days 
after a filament eruption, but only in several AR-associated storms the time interval between an 
eruption and storm maximum did not exceeded 90 hr. More than a half of the QS events have Δtp 
> 80 hr and Dst > –150 nT while the majority of the AR events have Δtp < 70 hr and Dst < –150 
nT. The strength of the most intense QS-associated GMS of 9 November 1991 was Dst ≈ – 354 
nT and the peak transit time Δtp ≈ 76 hr, and in the strongest AR storms of 2 September 1859, 15 
May 1921, 23 July 2012 Dst reached –900 nT in the 18–27 hr after an eruption. 

Secondly,  in  spite  of  the  wide  scatter,  both  the  AR  and  QS  events  display  an  evident 
tendency  that  the  storm  strength  increases  with  the  decreasing  peak  transit  time.  In  particular, 
8 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
this tendency is revealed by the strongest GMSs at the outer edge of the scatter plot of the whole 
sample of events. This is also evidenced by the averaged values of Dst calculated in several Δtp 
bins. It is clear that this tendency is less pronounced for GMSs associated with the QS filament 
eruptions  due  to  a  smaller  range  of  the  storm  strength.  For  the  QS  events,  the  average  GMS 
intensity  remains  almost  unchanged  (<Dst  >  ≈  –100  nT  for  the  analyzed  set  of  events)  with  a 
peak transient time in the range of Δtp > 80 hr and somewhat increases (to < Dst > ≈ –170 nT) 
for shorter Δtp. For the AR events, the average storm strength monotonously and more and more 
sharply becomes stronger from < Dst > ≈ –100 nT at Δtp > 80 hr to < Dst > ≈ –450 nT with Δtp < 
40 hr. 

The large scatter of events in Figure 1 it is due to many of obvious and important factors 
(e.g. reviews by Kilpua, Koskinen, and Pulkkinen, 2017; Manchester et al., 2017; Yermolaev et 
al., 2018). In particular,  the GMS intensity strongly depends on the ICME type (whether it is a 
magnetic cloud or an ejecta), on its internal structure including a sheath region and flux rope, on 
the magnetic field strength brought by an ICME to the Earth, on what part of its field falls on the 
negative Bz component, on whether an ICME hits the magnetosphere with front or the glancing 
impact occurs, and others. In addition, it is known that the geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions is 
subjected  to  the  pronounced  seasonal  variation,  being  larger  around  equinoxes  and  smaller  at 
solstices  (Cliver  and  Crooker,  1993).  In  turn,  the  ICME  transit  time  depends  on  the  initial 
velocity  of  a CME in the  corona, on  the ICME drag and deceleration  by the  background solar 
wind,  on  its  interaction  with  various  interplanetary  structures,  and  so  on.  All  these  factors  can 
match in a variety of combinations that leads to the observed scatter. 

 4. Summary and Discussion 

We studied the large and updated dataset of non-recurrent GMSs with variegated intensity and 
their eruptive sources from the central sector of the solar disk. We considered about 140 isolated 
events over the period 1859–2018 and focused on the relationship between the ICME transit time 
and  the  GMS  strength  scaled  by  the  Dst  index.  There  are  two  additional  differences  from 
previous  studies.  For  example  the  ICME  transit  time,  the  interval  Δtp  between  the  time  of  the 
solar eruption and the GMS peak (the minimum value of Dst), but not the GMS onset (ΔTo), was 
taken. Two types of GMSs initiated by CMEs/ICMEs formed by the flare-associated eruptions in 
active regions (AR events) and by the filament eruptions from quiescent areas of the Sun located 
outside  ARs  (QS  events)  were  considered  in  a  single  view,  but  were  distinguished  from  each 
other.  Such  an  analysis  made  it  possible  to  obtain  a  more  comprehensive  and  visually  clear 
picture of the relationship between the ICME transit time and the GMS strength. 

Despite significant  scatter of  the CME/ICME  and GMS  characteristics caused  by many 
factors  described  in  the  Section  3,  the  performed  analysis  of  the  extensive  sample  of  events 
(Figure 1) reveals regularities which confirm and substantially clarify known trends (see Kim et 
al., 2010; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013; Dumbović  et al., 2015; Gopalswamy, Tsurutani, and Yan, 
2015;  Ibrahim  et  al.,  2019;    Zou  et  al.,  2019).  Firstly,  the  AR  events  are  characterized  by  the 
shorter ICME peak transit time and stronger storm intensity than the QS associated GMSs. In our 
sample, the AR storms  display Δtp mainly between  20–90 hr  and Dst up to extreme –900 nT, 
while for the QS storms these parameters vary within 60–140 hr and Dst > –350 nT. It is obvious 
that these differences between the two types of GMSs are due to that the AR eruptions occur in 
strong  sunspot  magnetic  fields  and  the  QS  eruptions  are  associated  with  the  relatively  weak 
magnetic  fields  of  the  quiescent  areas.  Secondly,  the  GMS  strength increases  (Dst  goes  down) 
with decreasing peak transit time Δtp. It is demonstrated by the strongest GMSs at the outer edge 
of  the  scatter  plot  of  the  whole  sample  of  events  as  well  as  by  the  averaged  values  of  Dst 
calculated  in  several  Δtp  bins.  This  important  feature  is  characteristic  for  both  AR-  and  QS 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
events,  but  for  AR  storms  it  is  more  clear.  In  particular,  the  average  strength  of  the  AR-
associated GMSs monotonously and more and more sharply becomes stronger from < Dst > ≈ –
100 nT at Δtp > 80 hr to < Dst > ≈ –450 nT at Δtp < 40 hr. Thus, the most intense and rapidly 
advancing GMSs are certainly initiated by AR eruptions, and the weakest and severely delayed 
GMSs are caused by QS filament eruptions outside ARs. Based on this, it is reasonable to expect 
that GMSs, associated with eruptions of the intermediate type in relation to AR and QS ones, fall 
in the middle of the scatter plot (Figure 1) where AR and QS events overlap. 

The  regularities  indicated  above  can  be  interpreted  as  an  evidence  that  the  main  ICME 
parameters on which the intensity of the corresponding GMSs depends, such as the ICME speed 
and strength of the inner magnetic field, are largely determined by the characteristics of the solar 
eruptions,  particularly,  the  eruptive  magnetic  flux.  This  is  consistent,  for  example,  with  the 
finding  of  Chertok  et  al.  (2013)  that  the  GMS  strength  enhances  and  the  ICME  transit  time 
decreases with increasing eruptive magnetic flux, which can be estimated, e.g., through analysis 
of extreme ultraviolet dimmings (see Dissauer et al., 2018), post-eruption arcades (Gopalswamy 
et al., 2017), and flare ribbons (Kazachenko et al., 2017). Further, Pal et al. (2018) established 
the dependence of the CME properties on characteristics of their solar source active region and 
associated  flare  reconnection  flux  that  in  turn  determines  the  severity  and  onset  time  of  the 
associated GMSs. Further, sufficiently good direct correlations between the near-Sun CME sky-
plane speed and the strength of the associated GMSs, especially for the magnetic cloud ICMEs, 
have  been  reported  by,  e.g.,  Srivastava  and  Venkatakrishnan  (2004),  Kim  et  al.  (2010), 
Gopalswamy  (2010),  and  Shanmugaraju  et  al.  (2015).  It  is  worth  adding  that,  according  to 
Michalek,  Gopalswamy,  and  Yashiro  (2008),  the  transit  time  to  Earth  of  ICMEs,  initiated  by 
halo CMEs, reveals a clear reversed dependence on the deprojected space speed of the latter (see 
also Ibrahim et al., 2019). This means that as a result of solar eruptions the highest speed ICMEs 
acquire  such  large  kinetic  energy  that  effectively  overcomes  the  aerodynamic  drag  while  they 
propagate in the solar wind. At the same time, such high-speed ICMEs bring to Earth sufficiently 
strong magnetic fields, that allows them, under favorable conditions, to cause severe and extreme 
GMSs. The comprehensive picture of the relationships between the travel time of ICMEs and the 
intensity of the corresponding GMSs presented in this article may be useful for further studies of 
the solar eruptions and predictions of their space weather impacts.
