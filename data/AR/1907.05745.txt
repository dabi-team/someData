production rate can be computed using semiclassical techniques without relying on perturbation
theory, and therefore it can be done reliably in spite of the monopoles strong coupling to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. This article explains this phenomenon and discusses the bounds on monopole
masses arising from the strongest magnetic ﬁelds in the Universe, which are in neutron stars
known as magnetars and in heavy ion collision experiments such as lead-lead collisions carried out
in November 2018 in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It will also discuss open theoretical
questions aﬀecting the calculation.

INTRODUCTION

particles,

Why do electrically charged particles exist but
i.e., magnetic
magneti-cally
charged
If they did,
monopoles, appa-rently do not [1, 2]?
Maxwell’s equations would have a perfect duality
symmetry between electricity and magnetism. In 1931,
Dirac showed that (static) magnetic monopoles are
compatible with quantum mechanics [3], provided that
their magnetic charge g and the electric charges e
of all electrically charged particle satisfy the Dirac
quantisation condition,

eg
2π ∈

Z.

(1)

This implies that both electric and magnetic charges have
to be quantised, and if the elementary electric charge is
the charge of the positron, then the elementary magnetic
charge is the Dirac charge,

gD =

2π
e ≈

20.7.

(2)

Because gD ≫

1, quantum ﬁeld theory of magnetic
monopoles cannot be studied using standard perturba-
tion theory techniques. One consequence of this fail-
ure of perturbation theory is that it is not possible
to compute the production cross section of magnetic
monopoles in particle collisions. Collider searches of mag-
netic monopoles can therefore only report upper bounds
on the cross section, rather than actual constraints on
the theory parameters such as the monopole mass.
In
practice, it is customary for the experiments to quote
mass bounds obtained by assuming the tree-level Drell-
Yan cross section, but these bounds cannot be taken lit-
erally and serve mainly as a way of comparing the per-
formance of diﬀerent experiments.

Furthermore,

for solitonic monopoles such as the
’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole [4, 5], there are semiclas-
sical arguments that their production cross section in el-
ementary particle collisions would be exponentially sup-
pressed [6, 7]. The argument does not apply, at least in
the same form, to elementary magnetic monopoles, but it
still raises the question of whether their production cross
section may also be very diﬀerent from the Drell-Yan es-
timates.

In this paper, I will discuss a diﬀerent monopole pro-
duction process, namely Schwinger pair production in
strong magnetic ﬁelds [8–10]. Its rate can be computed
using semiclassical instanton techniques, without having
to assume a weak coupling. Therefore it does not suﬀer
from the same strong-coupling issue as the perturbative
calculations. It is also largely independent of the micro-
scopic details of the monopoles, and within limits, the
same results will therefore apply to both elementary and
solitonic monopoles. This means that it is possible to
obtain actual, largely model-indepenent lower bounds on
the magnetic monopole mass.

The strongest known magnetic ﬁeld in the Universe are
in certain neutron stars called magnetars and in heavy
ion collision experiments. I discuss the Schwinger process
in both cases, and review the monopole mass bounds
obtained from them.

II. ELEMENTARY AND SOLITONIC
MONOPOLES

In principle, magnetic monopoles can appear in quan-
tum ﬁeld theory as either elementary or composite parti-
cles. In the former case, there is a separate quantum ﬁeld
associated with the monopole, whereas in the latter case,
they are states made up of other ﬁelds. At weak coupling,
this state is usually a semiclassical soliton solution, and
therefore I will refer to these as solitonic monopoles.

The best known example of a solitonic monopole is the

’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole solution [4, 5] in the Georgi-
Glashow model [11], an SU(2) gauge theory with an ad-
joint scalar ﬁeld Φ. When the scalar ﬁeld has a non-zero
vacuum expectation value, it breaks the gauge symme-
try to U(1), and therefore the low energy eﬀective theory
corresponds to electrodynamics.

In the classical theory, the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole

is a smooth solution of the ﬁeld equations, of the form

and it has the magnetic charge g = 4π/e = 2gD, where e
is the SU(2) gauge coupling and also corresponds to the
elementary electric charge. The monopole mass is given
by the energy of the solution, and is approximately

The same monopole exists also in the quantum theory
as a non-perturbative state, and at weak coupling it is
well approximated by the classical solution. Quantum
corrections to it can be calculated perturbatively [12],
because the coupling constant of the theory is e
1, not
g = 4π/e
1. One can also go beyond perturbation
theory by using lattice Monte Carlo methods [13, 14].

≫

The ’t Hooft-Polyakov solution can be found in any
Grand Uniﬁed Theory (GUT) [15], and therefore the ex-
istence of magnetic monopoles is an unavoidable conse-
quence of grand uniﬁcation. The mass of these GUT
monopoles (4) would typically be around 1016 GeV,
which is well above the energies of any foreseeable parti-
cle collider experiments. However, there are theories that
have lighter solitonic monopole solutions [16, 17], possi-
bly even within the reach of the Large Hadron Collider.
Although most theoretical work has focused on soli-
tonic monopoles, it is also important to consider the case
of elementary monopoles. In practice, theoretical calcu-
lations with them are diﬃcult, not only because of their
strong charge, which makes perturbation theory invalid,
but also because the existing quantum theory formula-
tions are cumbersome [18–20]. However, that is not an ar-
gument against their existence. If the magnetic monopole
is an elementary particle, its mass is a free parameter. It
is therefore perfectly possible that it is at the TeV scale
or even lower, as long as it is compatible with the current
experimental bounds.

elementary monopoles would not actually appear fully
pointlike. However, because of the calculational diﬃcul-
ties due to the strong magnetic charge, there is no de-
tailed understanding of how this ﬁnite size arises. It is,
nevertheless, interesting to note that it agrees with the
size (5) of the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole. Indeed, the
distinction between elementary and solitonic monopoles
is not necessarily clear-cut, and there are examples of the-
ories which have two dual descriptions, in one of which
the monopoles are solitonic and in the other one elemen-
tary [23].

III. PRODUCTION CROSS SECTION

searches

There have been several

for magnetic
monopoles in particle colliders [24], including LEP, Teva-
tron and the LHC. The more recent results are from the
ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments at the LHC [25, 26].
Because there has been no positive discovery, these exper-
iments place upper bounds on the monopole production
cross section. In order to constrain actual theory param-
eters such as the monopole mass, one would need a reli-
able theoretical prediction for the production cross sec-
tion. Sadly such a prediction does not exist for monopole
production in collisions of elementary particles.

∈

The main obstacle to the calculation of the production
cross section of magnetic monopoles is their strong mag-
Z, which the Dirac quantisa-
netic charge g = ngD, n
tion condition (1) requires to be much greater than one.
This means that the calculation cannot be carried out us-
ing perturbation theory. There are also strong arguments
that the production cross section of solitonic monopoles,
such as GUT monopoles, is suppressed by an exponential
10−238 [6, 7]. This is because they
factor exp(
are highly ordered coherent lumps of ﬁeld consisting of
O(1/α) quanta. Even if there is enough energy available
to produce the monopoles, it is much more likely that
the same energy gets distributed to a large number of
particles in a less ordered fashion. It is not known if the
production cross section of elementary monopoles is sup-
pressed by a similar factor, because we currently do not
have the tools to carry out the calculation.

∼

Because of this theoretical uncertainty, experiments
tend to quote nominal mass bounds based on the tree-
level Drell Yan cross section. For monopoles with a single
Dirac charge, g = gD, this gives [25] M & 1850 GeV or
M & 2370 GeV, depending on whether they have spin
0 or 1/2, respectively. However, these nominal bounds
are mainly useful for comparing diﬀerent experiments
and should not be interpreted as actual lower bounds
on monopole masses. Much lighter monopoles can exist
if their production cross sections is low. In order to ob-
tain an actual mass bound, one therefore has to consider
other processes than monopole pair production from el-
ementary particle collisions.

IV. SCHWINGER PAIR PRODUCTION

In addition to elementary particle collisions, magnetic
monopoles can also be produced in a strong external mag-
netic ﬁeld by the Schwinger process.

It was shown by Sauter [27] and Schwinger [28] that
electrically charged particles are pair produced in a suf-
ﬁciently strong electric ﬁeld. This can be understood as
tunneling through the Coulomb potential barrier. The
rate of this process can be calculated using semiclassical
instanton techniques even at strong coupling [8, 9].

The solution has zero modes corresponding to transla-
tions in the four Euclidean directions, which contribute
a spacetime volume factor, which means that there is a
non-zero, ﬁnite rate per unit spacetime volume [9]

ﬁrmed directly in experiments [29, 30].

By the electromagnetic duality, if magnetic monopoles
exist, they would be pair produced by the same mecha-
nism in suﬃciently strong external magnetic ﬁeld. The

The Schwinger process at non-zero temperature was
studied in Ref. [35, 36]. To calculate the rate in the semi-
classical approximation, one needs to ﬁnd the instanton
in Euclidean space with a compact imaginary time direc-
tion of length β = 1/T . This breaks the Euclidean rota-
tion symmetry and therefore the instanton is no longer a
circle. Because of the strong coupling, the solutions have
to be found numerically, and this was done in Ref. [35].
The result for the SPS case is, however, simple. Be-
cause the temperature is suﬃciently high, the relevant
instanton is a time-dependent sphaleron solution, which
corresponds to a static monopole-antimonopole pair.

other open questions about magnetars, and with a better
understanding of them, one may well be able to improve
the bound further.

VII. LHC HEAVY ION COLLISIONS

The magnetic ﬁeld produced by a heavy ion collision
increases with the collision energy, and therefore the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) should be able to provide much
stronger bounds on monopole pair production and, there-
fore, on the monopole mass. There is no published data
on monopole searches at RHIC, so I will focus on the
LHC, which carried out a month-long heavy ion run
in November 2018, with collision energy per nucleon
√sN N = 5.02 TeV.

The evolution of the electromagnetic ﬁelds during the
collision was studied in Ref. [37]. The ﬁeld strength grows
linearly with collision energy, and is highest for collisions
with impact parameter b
13 fm, which corresponds
≈
to the diameter of the nucleus. Therefore we are mainly
interested in peripheral collisions, and can ignore thermal
eﬀects.

For the LHC energy, the peak magnetic ﬁeld strength

In the zeroth-order approximation,

Comparing Eq. (31) and (32), we see that the total
next-to-leading order action S(0)
E is negative if
ξ2 > 32M 2/g3B, which is always satisﬁed for LHC colli-
sions, irrespective of the monopole mass M . At the face
value this would imply that the pair production is un-
suppressed, but in practice it is more likely to be a signal
that the approximations have broken down.

E + S(1)

It is possible to ﬁnd the instanton to all orders in self-
interactions by solving the full non-linear equations nu-
merically [38]. Because the equations are non-local, this
is a computationally heavy task, and therefore it has cur-
rently only been done for relatively small ξ, where the
NLO approximation should be valid, and indeed, the re-
sults agree with it.

Again, this calculation is based on the assumption of a
pointlike monopole. For it to be valid, the monopole size
(6) needs to be smaller than the semi-minor axis ay of the
instanton, which gives the condition ξ2 . 8πM 2/g3B.
This coincides approximately with the value where the
NLO action in the pointlike approximation becomes neg-
ative, and is not satisﬁed for any monopole masses in
LHC heavy ion collisions. For an accurate and reliable
estimate of the production rate, it will therefore be neces-
sary to include the non-zero monopole size. For ’t Hooft-
Polyakov monopoles this can be done, at least in prin-
ciple, by ﬁnding the instanton solution in the full ﬁeld
theory.

As a rough estimate of the production cross section,
one can use the locally constant ﬁeld approximation, in
which the constant-ﬁeld rate (15) is integrated over the
spacetime volume were the ﬁelds are strongest. Within
this approximation,
if the LHC searches do not ﬁnd
monopoles, Eq. (17) would give a very rough bound

M & 70 GeV.

(33)

 
Because the eﬀect of the time-dependence appears to en-
hance the production, this can be expected to be a con-
servative estimate. A complete calculation may therefore
make the bound signiﬁcantly stronger.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The electromagnetic dual of Schwinger pair production
provides a new way of searching for magnetic monopoles.
If monopoles exist, they would be produced in a suﬃ-
ciently strong magnetic ﬁeld. Conversely, if this does
not happen, monopoles either do not exist or their mass
is too high. By considering physical instances of strong
magnetic ﬁelds, we can therefore derive lower bounds on
magnetic monopole masses. This requires a theoretical
calculation of the pair production rate, which can be car-
ried out using the semiclassical instanton method, which
does not require perturbation theory or the assumption
of a weak coupling. Therefore it can be applied to mag-
netic monopoles, whose coupling to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is necessarily strong.

In a constant ﬁeld at zero temperature, the rate can
be computed analytically and the result is independent
of the microscopic details of the monopoles and whether
they are elementary and solitonic. The resulting mass
bounds are therefore universal. In a time-dependent ﬁeld,
the full result requires a numerical calculation, and the ﬁ-
nite monopole size needs to be taken into account. There-
fore the precise result will also depend on the microscopic
nature of the monopoles. For solitonic ’t Hooft-Polyakov
monopoles, the numerical calculation is straightforward
in principle, although computationally very demanding.

Using this approach, the magnetic ﬁelds of magne-
tars imply a bound (21) of slightly below one GeV,
and heavy ion collisions at SPS an order of magnitude
stronger (27). The LHC should be able to improve sig-
niﬁcantly on these. The results of the one-month heavy-
ion run in November 2018 have not yet been published,
but the estimate (33) suggests that if monopoles with
mass M . 70 GeV exist, they would have been pro-
duced then. If data shows no monopoles, it will therefore
imply a lower mass bound of the same order. However,
obtaining the precise mass bound will need further theo-
retical work in order to take the time dependence of the
collision and the ﬁnite monopole size into account.

−

At the face value, this appears to be 20

30 times lower
than the current bounds from ATLAS and MoEDAL.
However, it is important to remember that all existing
mass bounds from proton-proton collisions are based on
perturbation theory, which is not actually valid for mag-
netic monopoles because of their strong magnetic charge.
Therefore one cannot currently rule out the existence of
monopoles with masses of even a few GeV, and the only
way to do that is to carry out these calculations and ex-
periments.
