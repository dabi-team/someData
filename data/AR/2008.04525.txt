Sequential Lid Removal in a Triple-Decker Chain of
CME-Producing Solar Eruptions

Navin Chandra Joshi1,2, Alphonse C. Sterling3, Ronald L. Moore3,4, Bhuwan Joshi1

ABSTRACT

We investigate the onsets of three consecutive coronal mass ejection (CME)
eruptions in 12 hours from a large bipolar active region (AR) observed by SDO,
STEREO, RHESSI, and GOES. Evidently, the AR initially had a “triple–decker”
conﬁguration: three ﬂux ropes in a vertical stack above the polarity inversion line
(PIL). Upon being bumped by a conﬁned eruption of the middle ﬂux rope, the
top ﬂux rope erupts to make the ﬁrst CME and its accompanying AR–spanning
ﬂare arcade rooted in a far-apart pair of ﬂare ribbons. The second CME is made
by eruption of the previously-arrested middle ﬂux rope, which blows open the
ﬂare arcade of the ﬁrst CME and produces a ﬂare arcade rooted in a pair of ﬂare
ribbons closer to the PIL than those of the ﬁrst CME. The third CME is made
by blowout eruption of the bottom ﬂux rope, which blows open the second ﬂare
arcade and makes its own ﬂare arcade and pair of ﬂare ribbons. Flux cancellation
observed at the PIL likely triggers the initial conﬁned eruption of the middle ﬂux
rope. That conﬁned eruption evidently triggers the ﬁrst CME eruption. The
lid-removal mechanism instigated by the ﬁrst CME eruption plausibly triggers
the second CME eruption. Further lid removal by the second CME eruption
plausibly triggers the ﬁnal CME eruption.

Introduction

Eruptions of solar ﬁlaments/prominences is among the most interesting phenomena that
occurs on the Sun. Solar ﬁlaments are cool and relatively dense plasma material suspended
in the hot and relatively tenuous solar corona. Prominences and ﬁlaments are the same
objects, being called ﬁlaments when observed against the solar disk and prominences when
viewed at the solar limb (see reviews by Labrosse et al. 2010; Mackay et al. 2010; Parenti
2014; Gibson 2018, and references cited therein). According to ﬂux-rope models of ﬁlaments
and prominences, they are supported by the helical magnetic ﬁeld of the ﬂux rope (e.g.,
Filippov et al. 2015, and references cited therein).

Filaments/prominences and ﬂux ropes remain stable in the solar corona by the equilib-
rium among the upward magnetic pressure, downward magnetic tension, and gravity. They
erupt when this equilibrium is disrupted. Various theories/models have been proposed in
order to explain the onset of solar eruptions (Forbes 2000; Lin et al. 2003; Schmieder et al.
2013). Three well-known models that have been proposed are “tether–cutting,” “ﬂux can-
cellation,” and the “magnetic breakout” models. The tether-cutting scenario was suggested
by Moore & Roumeliotis (1992) and Moore et al. (2001). According to this model, low-lying
tether-cutting magnetic reconnection triggers and unleashes the eruption. The low-lying
sheared arcade reconnects successively and forms the ﬂux rope. Continuing low-lying recon-
nection reduces the tension and allows the eruption of the formed ﬂux rope. The ﬂux rope
then erupts, and reconnection occurs beneath it. Several observed events have been studied
and interpreted using this model (e.g., Liu et al. 2012a, 2013; Joshi et al. 2014, 2017). The
magnetic breakout model considers a quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration (Antiochos et al.
1999). According to this model, reconnection at the magnetic null point that lies on top
of the middle arcade triggers the eruption of the underlying ﬂux rope. Fast reconnection
occurs below the erupting ﬂux rope in the next stage (see Karpen et al. 2012). Various
signatures of the breakout model have been observed and interpreted in solar eruptive
events (Aulanier et al. 2000; Gary & Moore 2004; Sterling & Moore 2004a,b; Deng et al.
2005; Joshi et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2010; Aurass et al. 2011, 2013; Mitra et al. 2018). Ac-
cording to the ﬂux-emergence model suggested by Chen & Shibata (2000), an emerging
bipole within the ﬁlament channel cancels with the magnetic ﬁeld below the ﬁlament (or
the ﬂux rope) and triggers its eruption. Apart from this, ideal MHD instability has also
been investigated to trigger solar eruptions, e.g., by catastrophic loss of equilibrium (e.g.,
Forbes & Isenberg 1991), kink instability (e.g., T¨or¨ok et al. 2004; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005), and
torus instability (e.g., Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006).

Triggering the eruption of a ﬁlament/ﬂux rope by a nearby erupting ﬁlament and/or ﬂux
rope has also been observed and discussed. Such eruptions and called sympathetic eruptions

– 3 –

(Wang et al. 2001, 2007; Liu et al. 2009; Schrijver & Title 2011; Jiang et al. 2011; Yang et al.
2012; Shen et al. 2012; Joshi et al. 2016b; Wang et al. 2016). Wang et al. (2001) studied
sympathetic ﬂares and accompanying CMEs from two active regions (ARs), NOAA ARs
8869 and 8872, and discussed the linkage between them through connecting loops. Liu et al.
(2009) analyzed successive solar eruptions and CMEs that occurred on 2005 September 13
and found an interrelation among the eruptions. A series of eruptions, CMEs, and related
events were observed over 2010 August 1-2 and it was reported that they were connected
by a system of separatrices, separators and quasi-separatrix layers (Schrijver & Title 2011).
Successive eruptions that occurred on 2003 November 19 have been interpreted as being
sympathetic in nature using coronal dimming observations (Jiang et al. 2011). Yang et al.
(2012) investigated successive sympathetic eruptions of two ﬁlaments in a bipolar helmet
streamer magnetic conﬁguration observed on 2005 August 5. In a typical quadrupolar mag-
netic conﬁguration, Shen et al. (2012) observed sympathetic partial and full eruptions that
occurred on 2011 May 12. Recently, Joshi et al. (2016b) studied two successive adjacent
ﬁlament eruptions and investigated the chain of reconnections during them. Wang et al.
(2016) investigated the sympathetic nature of two eruptions that occurred on 2015 March 15
and also noted that the second eruption gave the largest geomagnetic storm of the current
solar cycle. Two successive ﬂux rope eruptions and accompanying CMEs that occurred on
2012 January 23 have been studied by several authors (Joshi et al. 2013; Cheng et al. 2013;
Sterling et al. 2014). Some sort of magnetic/physical connections between the sympathetic
eruptions have been observed in all these studies. For example, Sterling et al. (2014) argued
that removal of ﬂux above a ﬁlament/ﬂux-rope-carrying non-potential ﬁeld arcade can lead
to destabilization and eruption of the ﬁlament/ﬂux rope, a process they called lid removal.
A few attempts to model these kinds of sympathetic eruptions have also been made (see e.g.,
T¨or¨ok et al. 2011; Lynch & Edmondson 2013).

The eruption of double-decker ﬁlaments, which are composed of two ﬁlament branches
separated in height, have been observed and studied (Su et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012b; Kliem et al.
2014; Ding et al. 2014; Zhu & Alexander 2014; Cheng et al. 2014b; Awasthi et al. 2019;
Zheng et al. 2019). Liu et al. (2012b) observed the eruption of a double-decker ﬁlament
having its pre-eruption two branches separated in height by about 13 Mm, and found evi-
dence that transfer of ﬂux and current from the lower branch to the upper branch was the
triggering process for the partial eruption of the upper branch (see also Kliem et al. 2014).
Zhu & Alexander (2014) studied a similar kind of partial eruption of the upper branch of
a double-decker ﬁlament that occurred on 2012 May 9. They interpret the eruption in the
same way as suggested by Liu et al. (2012b).

Several works have investigated an interesting set of multiple eruptions occurring from
active region AR 11745. Li & Zhang (2013) studied the dynamics and homologous eruption

– 4 –

of four ﬂux ropes from AR 11745 on 2013 May 20-22, in order to understand the characteris-
tics of ﬂux ropes. They observed that these ﬂux ropes erupted consecutively from the active
region. Slow ﬂux rope eruption did not produce a CME, while fast eruption did produce
a CME. Cheng et al. (2014a) studied the morphological evolution, kinematics and thermal
properties of one of the erupting magnetic ﬂux ropes on 2013 May 22 from AR 11745. For
that particular ﬂux rope eruption, they proposed two distinct phases of evolution. In the
ﬁrst phase, the slow-rising phase of the eruption, reconnection occurred within the quasi-
separatrix layers surrounding the ﬂux rope. In the later phase, the impulsive-acceleration
phase of the eruption, fast reconnection occurred underneath the ﬂux rope. The torus in-
stability was found to be responsible for the transition from slow to fast erupting phase.
M¨akel¨a et al. (2016) studied the source region of type II radio bursts observed on 2013 May
22, and found that the interaction of two CMEs launched from the AR 11745 coincided with
the type II emissions. They further recognized that successive eruptions from the same active
region produced CME–CME interaction that resulted in solar energetic particle acceleration
(see also Ding et al. 2014). None of these studies however focused on the triggering process
for the successive ﬂux rope eruptions from above the same polarity inversion line (PIL) of
AR 11745.

In this work, we revisit the eruption events that occurred in AR 11745 on 2013 May
22, with the motivation of exploring the complex triggering process. We present signiﬁcant
additional results for the triggering processes of these four successive ﬂux rope eruptions from
the single PIL of the bipolar active region NOAA AR 11745. The ﬁrst eruption is of the
“conﬁned” variety, during which a ﬁlament gets activated and attains quasi-stable height.
The three subsequent eruptions are ejective eruptions (blowout eruptions) that each produce
a CME. We interpret that the three consecutive successful eruptions are intimately linked
with a “triple–decker” ﬂux rope conﬁguration formed in the source region. We focus our
study on the cause of onset and the interrelationship among these four eruptions, including

we describe the observational data set. Section 3 presents the morphology of the active
region and the potential–ﬁeld source–surface (PFSS) extrapolation. The observed onsets
and dynamics of the four eruptions and their CMEs are presented in Section 4. Section 5
summarizes the main results and presents additional discussion.

2. Data set

Data from various instruments are used to study the four consecutive eruptive events.
Ultraviolet (UV) and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images are observed by the Atmospheric

with a temporal cadence of 12 s, 24 s and 1 hr, respectively and pixel size of 0.6′′. Line-of-

sight (LOS) magnetograms with temporal cadence of 45 s with pixel size of 0.5′′ are obtained
by SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012). Full–Sun X–ray ﬂux
at 1-8 ˚A and 0.5-4 ˚A is observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
(GOES). Light curves and images in X-rays for the energy range 3-100 keV are obtained from
the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002). For
RHESSI X–ray image construction, we use the PIXON algorithm with a time integration
time of 20 s.

We also use imaging data from the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric In-
vestigation/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (SECCHI/EUVI), which is an instrument on-board
the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO Wuelser et al. 2004; Howard et al.

vides images with 1.6′′ pixels. To study the CMEs that accompany the eruptions, we use
coronagraph data from STEREO-A/COR1 (Howard et al. 2008) and the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Helio-
spheric Observatory (SOHO).

3. Morphology of the active region and PFSS extrapolation

Figure 1(a) shows the western half of the Sun in an SDO/AIA 304 ˚A image at ≈00:00
UT on 2013 May 22. The bipolar active region from which the eruptions originated is shown
in the white box in Figure 1(a). As seen, the active region was in the north-west quadrant
of the Sun. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) are zoomed views of the active region in 171 ˚A and
4500 ˚A images. A sunspot can be seen in the 4500 ˚A image (shown by the white arrow in
Figure 1(c)).

Figures 2(a)–(c) show SDO/HMI line–of–sight magnetograms during the period 2013
May 18–22. The magnetic ﬁeld structure of the active region NOAA AR 11745 is overall
bipolar, with leading negative and following positive polarities. There was a large negative-
polarity sunspot in this active region. On comparing the HMI images from 2013 May 18 to 22,
we see that the overall magnetic structure of the region does not show much change. However,
from the HMI 720 s line-of-sight magnetogram movie clearly indicates that cancellation
is occurring at the main neutral line (see the movie accompanying Figure 2). We have
also inspected the HMI SHARP series vector magnetograms, and they are consistent with
cancellation occurring at that neutral line. We only display the line-of-sight movie here
because the vector movies are of poorer ﬁdelity. From the observed apparent ﬂux cancellation
we can now conclude that the build-up and triggering mechanism of the earliest conﬁned
ﬂux-rope eruption was probably ﬂux cancellation at the PIL (Moore & Roumeliotis 1992).

The ﬁeld structure in the active region’s corona is obtained using the potential-ﬁeld
source-surface (PFSS, Schrijver & De Rosa 2003) extrapolation method. PFSS is an IDL–

– 8 –

based algorithm that is available in the SolarSoftWare package (SSW1). The extrapolated
magnetic ﬁeld lines are shown in Figures 2(d)–(e). Figure 2(d) shows a full disk magnetogram
of 2013 May 20 at ≈00:04 UT. Figure 2(e) shows a zoomed view corresponding to the white
box area shown in Figure 2(d). From the extrapolation we can see a low-lying arcade, as
well as overlying larger coronal-ﬁeld loops, connecting the negative and positive polarities
across the PIL.

4. Dynamic evolution of the successive eruptions

4.1.

Investigation of intensity proﬁles

The GOES and RHESSI X–ray temporal ﬂux proﬁles are shown in Figure 3(a). We
can see three events of ﬂux enhancements (marked by I, II, and III in Figure 3(a)) that
correspond to three CME–producing eruptive ﬂares. The ﬁrst event (i.e. event I) is actually
a composite of two distinct eruptive events that include an early conﬁned eruption of an
activated ﬁlament that subsequently triggered the eruption of an overlying ﬂux rope system,
causing the ﬁrst CME. The ﬁrst event, which starts to rise at ≈02:25 UT, peaks at ≈02:56
UT, and ends at ≈03:08 UT, is a small C1.9-class ﬂare. The second event, which starts at
≈06:40 UT, peaks at ≈10:08 UT, and ends at ≈12:00 UT, is a C2.3-class ﬂare. The third
event (which is an M5.0 class ﬂare) starts at ≈12:20 UT, peaks at ≈13:32 UT, and ends
at ≈23:00 UT, displaying an extended decay phase. The RHESSI X-ray proﬁles also show
peaks (see colored proﬁles in Figure 3(a)) that correspond to the peaks in the GOES X-ray
proﬁles during the ﬂares. In the RHESSI X–ray proﬁle, we can observe many large data gaps
spanning tens of minutes. These gaps are due periods of RHESSI night or passage through
the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA).

To conﬁrm the source of X–ray ﬂux enhancements during these three eruption episodes,
we also made AIA 94 ˚A time proﬁles (shown by solid red line in Figures 3(b)–(c)). Figure 3(b)
shows the intensity proﬁle from ≈02:00 UT to ≈04:30 UT during the conﬁned-eruption ﬂare,
while Figure 3(c) shows the intensity proﬁle from ≈06:00 UT to ≈16:00 UT during the ﬂares
of the second and third CME eruptions. The area used to calculate the intensity proﬁles
during the ﬁrst eruption is the ﬁeld–of–view (FOV) of Figure 4(c), while for the second and
third eruptions the area used is the FOV of Figure 7(a). The average values within these
areas are used for these intensity-time proﬁles. Here we see that the variation in AIA 94 ˚A
ﬂux is similar to that of GOES X-ray ﬂux (cf. AIA and GOES ﬂux proﬁles in Figures 3(b)–

ﬂare events.

SDO/AIA 335 ˚A intensity (animation 1) and running diﬀerence images of SDO/AIA 94
(animation 2) showing the activation of ﬁlament and subsequent eruption from ≈02:15 UT
to ≈03:15 UT on 2013 May 22 are available in the online journal.

The conﬁned eruption that triggers the ﬁrst CME eruption starts at ≈02:25 UT, with
the activation and conﬁned eruption of an upper strand of the low–lying ﬁlament. Figure 4
presents SDO/AIA 335, 131 and 94 ˚A images showing this low-lying activity. The activated
ﬁlament can be seen very well in AIA 335 ˚A-channel images at ≈02:31 UT (shown by the
arrow in Figure 4(a) and accompanying AIA 335 ˚A movie). In this conﬁned eruption, this
low-lying ﬁlament ﬂux rope was arrested within the coronal ﬁeld of the AR, as can be seen in
AIA 131 ˚A images (shown by the arrow in Figure 4(b)). The hot ﬂare loops below the arrested
ﬂux rope are also observed in the hot AIA 94 ˚A channel (see Figure 4(c) and accompanying
animation), and are presumably rooted in the inner parts of the two ﬂare ribbons, the parts
closely bracketing the PIL (we will refer to these two inner parts of the pair of ﬂare ribbons
as R0a and R0b). The ribbons R0a and R0b are pointed to by arrows in Figures 5(d)–(f),
and are seen in the AIA 304 and 1600 ˚A animations accompanying Figure 5. This eruption
was faint in other AIA channels. This low-lying activity, we believe, triggered the ejective
eruption of an overlying ﬂux rope, even though this low-lying ﬁlament eruption remained
conﬁned in the coronal ﬁeld of the AR. The ﬁeld that overarches the ejectively erupting
ﬂux rope, and that is blown out by it, can be seen in the SDO/AIA 94 ˚A running diﬀerence

195 ˚A running diﬀerence images (shown by the white arrows in Figures 5(a)–(c) and accom-
panying STEREO EUVI 195 ˚A movies). STEREO-A EUVI observed this eruption from the
west, giving us a diﬀerent viewing angle. We also observed the brightening in the remote
regions (marked by R1a and R1b in Figure 5(d)), which we identify as the ﬂare ribbons made
by reconnection below an erupting ﬂux rope. On comparing the ribbons of Figures 5(d) with
the line–of–sight photospheric magnetogram (Figure 5(e)), we ﬁnd that R0a and R1a lie in
positive ﬂux, and R0b and R1b lie in negative ﬂux.

The projected height–time plot of this CME eruption using STEREO-A EUVI images
is shown in Figure 6(a). The height–time data points are measured along the dashed red line
shown in Figure 5(c). To obtain the height–time data points, we trace the visible leading
edge of the erupting structure. Three repeated measurements of the height data points have
been made to get the average value as well as the errors in the height measurements. The
average of these three measurements is the value for each point. The error values in the
measurements are the standard deviations of the three height measurements. The linear
ﬁt to the height–time points gives us the speed, which comes out to be ≈167 km s−1 (see
Figure 6(a)).

4.3. Onset and progression of the second CME eruption

The second CME eruption is observed well in the hot SDO/AIA 94 ˚A channel, as well
as in the STEREO-A/EUVI 195 ˚A channel. A selection of AIA 94 ˚A images showing the
eruption sequence is presented in Figures 7(a)–(c). Eruption of the visible coronal ﬁeld lines
(shown by the dotted arc in Figures 7(a)–(c)) starts at around 07:00 UT, and is observed
until 08:15 UT in the AIA ﬁeld–of–view (see the SDO/AIA 94 ˚A intensity and running
diﬀerence animations accompanying Figure 7). The eruption was also observed by STEREO
EUVI from the west. The ﬁeld–loop blowout eruption is clearly seen in EUVI 195 ˚A running
diﬀerence images (see Figure 7(d)–(f) and animation accompanying Figure 5). The formation
of the ﬂare arcade is observed to take place simultaneously with the eruption. The arcade
formed just below the erupting structure (see Figures 7(a)–(c)). The ﬂare arcade started
forming at ≈06:41 UT. This shows that the ﬂux rope in this eruption already started to
erupt before the eruption of the outer loops seen in 94 ˚A started at ≈07:00 UT. The ﬂare
arcade grew in height with time (see Figures 7(a)–(c) and accompanying animation).

The two feet of the ﬂare arcade are in the two ﬂare ribbons (Figures 8(a)–(b)). Fig-
ures 8(a) and 8(b) display SDO/AIA 304 ˚A and 1600 ˚A images at around ≈10:01 UT,
showing the ﬂare ribbons near the western limb. HMI photospheric magnetogram contours

evolution: an initial slow eruption with an average speed of around ≈13 km s−1 from ≈06:45
UT to ≈08:00 UT (see red line in Figure 6(b)), and a second stage during which it accelerates
to ≈56 km s−1 from ≈08:00 UT to ≈08:15 UT (see green ﬁtted line in Figure 6(b)). The

– 16 –

height–time proﬁle of STEREO EUVI 195 ˚A show the same two steps, and gives ≈43 km s−1
for the speed in the second phase (see the orange line in Figure 6(b)). Such two-stage rises
in ﬁlament trajectories are not uncommon (Sterling & Moore 2005; McCauley et al. 2015;
Joshi et al. 2016a; Mitra & Joshi 2019).

4.4. Onset and progression of the third CME eruption

The third CME eruption was well observed in almost all EUV channels of AIA. SDO/AIA
94 ˚A images showing the eruption of the ﬂux rope are presented in Figure 9(a)–(c). This
episode starts with a compact brightening near the polarity inversion line at around ≈12:13
UT (shown by the arrow in Figure 9(a)). This brightening is probably due to runaway
tether–cutting reconnection between the legs of the low-lying sheared arcade. The ﬂux rope
eruption starts at ≈12:13 UT (Figure 6(c)) and was in its fast-rise phase by ≈12:40 UT
(Figure 6(c)). The compact brightening and the onset of the eruption of the ﬂux rope take
place under the second-ﬂare arcade (see Figure 9(a)–(c) and the animation accompanying
Figure 7). The reconnection takes place below the erupting ﬂux rope between the legs of the
enveloping arcade. As a result, the ﬂare arcade is formed underneath the erupting ﬂux rope
and can be seen in Figures 9(d)–(e). We also observed RHESSI X–ray sources at the top of
the ﬂare arcade as well as at the feet (see diﬀerent color contours in the inset of Figure 9(e)).
The erupting ﬂux rope can also be seen in STEREO-A EUVI 195 ˚A running diﬀerence image
at ≈12:40 UT (Figure 9(f) and the STEREO-A EUVI 195 ˚A running diﬀerence animation
accompanying Figure 5). The erupting ﬂux rope blows out the overlying arcade that formed
during the second CME eruption (Figure 9(d)).

This eruption produced two parallel ﬂare ribbons seen in AIA (see Figure 10(a)–(b)) and
STEREO-A EUVI (see Figure 10(c)) images. The eastern and western ribbons of the ﬂare
are marked as R3a and R3b, respectively, in Figure 10(a)–(c). HMI photospheric line–of–
sight contours are overplotted on the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A image with green (positive) and blue
(negative) colors. The eastern and western ribbons lie on the positive and negative polarity
regions, respectively. The ﬂare arcade connecting the two ribbons can be seen at the later
time at ≈15:15 UT in AIA 304 ˚A (Figure 10(d)), 171 ˚A (Figure 10(e)) and STEREO EUVI
195 ˚A (see Figure 10(f)) images.

Figure 11 presents the evolution of three successive CME eruptions, as observed in both

ﬁrst CME eruption (Figures 11(a)–(c)). This ﬁrst CME appears in the STEREO COR1
ﬁeld–of–view at ≈02:55 UT (Figure 11(a)) and in the LASCO C2 ﬁeld of view at ≈03:15
UT (Figure 11(c)). This ﬁrst CME only shows a leading-edge structure without a visible

(see Figures 11(d)–(f) and Figures 11(g)–(i), respectively). This is evidence that the second
and third CMEs were made by the eruption of ﬂux ropes, which appear as the CME cores in
the second and third CMEs (see Figures 11(e) and Figures 11(i), respectively) The speeds of
the ﬁrst, second and third CMEs are 244 km s−1, 687 km s−1and 1466 km s−1, respectively2.

5. Results and Discussion

In this work, we analyzed the sequence of four consecutive eruptions that occurred on
2013 May 22 from a single AR, NOAA AR 11745. The active region was overall bipolar
with a straight PIL. We interpreted the progression of the eruption sequence using a multi-
wavelength and multi-view data set from SDO and STEREO-A. The main ﬁndings of this
work are as follows.

1. Our observations are consistent with the scenario that initially there was a stack of
three ﬂux ropes above the PIL of the AR. We call this conﬁguration a “triple-decker”
ﬂux rope conﬁguration.

2. The eruption of ﬁrst (highest) ﬂux rope is triggered by the activation and conﬁned
eruption of the middle ﬂux rope, which is an upper strand of a low-lying ﬁlament. This
conﬁned eruption disturbs the overlying ﬁeld lines and triggers the CME-producing
eruption of the topmost ﬂux rope. The conﬁned eruption made ﬂare ribbons close to
the PIL, and the CME eruption produced ribbons far-oﬀset from the PIL.

3. The second CME eruption is the blowout eruption of the previously–arrested middle
ﬂux rope. The removal of overlying ﬂux by the ﬁrst ﬂux rope’s eruption triggers this
second CME-producing ﬂux rope eruption. A large scale ﬂare arcade and ribbons are
also observed to be made by this second eruption.

4. In the third CME eruption the lowest ﬂux rope (carrying the remaining strands of the
ﬁlament) blows out, followed by the formation of a new ﬂare arcade and ﬂare ribbons.
The removal of overlying ﬂux by the second CME eruption triggered this third CME
eruption.

5. The ﬁrst CME shows only faint structure, while the second and third CMEs show full
three-part structure. We presume that there also was an erupting ﬂux rope inside the
ﬁrst CME, although the ﬂux-rope structure of the second and third CMEs is more
obvious.

6. The sequential removal of overlying ﬂux (i.e., lid removal; Sterling et al. 2014) dur-
ing the ﬁrst and second CME eruptions respectively trigger the second and third
CME eruptions. We suppose that the conﬁned ﬁrst eruption that triggered the ﬁrst
CME was triggered by slow ﬂux–cancellation tether-cutting reconnection at the PIL
(Moore & Roumeliotis 1992).

A schematic representation of this sequence of eruptions is shown in Figure 12. In Fig-
ure 12(a), the coronal loops from low to high heights are shown by green, red, blue and black
colors respectively, along with ﬂux ropes in between. The ﬁrst CME eruption is triggered by
the activation and conﬁned eruption of upper strands of the ﬁlament in the middle ﬂux rope,
i.e. ﬂux rope 2 (Figure 12(b) and 4(a)). This conﬁned eruption is plausibly triggered by
slow ﬂux-cancellation tether–cutting reconnection at the PIL (Moore & Roumeliotis 1992)
(see HMI magnetic ﬁeld animations accompanying Figure 2). This conﬁned eruption of the
ﬂux rope 2 ﬁlament disturbed the equilibrium of the topmost ﬂux rope 1 and triggered it
to erupt (cf. Figure 12(b) and 5(a)–(c)). Flare reconnection from the conﬁned eruption
occurred underneath the erupting ﬂux rope (shown by the lower red star in Figure 12(b))
causing heated innermost ﬂare ribbons denoted as R0a and R0b (Figures 5(d)–(f)). The
continued eruption of the topmost ﬂux rope 1 is followed by the reconnection underneath it,
heating the farther-separated pair of ﬂare ribbons (R1a and R1b in Figures 12(b) and Fig-
ures 5(d)–(e)) and unleashing the ﬁrst CME (cf. Figure 12(b) and 11(a)–(c)). At this time
ﬂux rope 2 does not erupt, but remains stable at some higher height in the solar corona
for a few hours. It then starts to erupt upward slowly and drives CME 2 ﬂare reconnection
underneath it between the red ﬁeld lines (Figure 12(c) and Figure 7). This makes a new
pair of ﬂare ribbons (see yellow ovals in Figures 12(c)–(d) and Figures 8(a)–(c)) and ﬂare
arcade (cf. Figure 12(d) and Figures 8 (d)–(f)). The erupting ﬂux rope 2 drives the second
CME (CME2 in Figure 12(d) and Figures 11(d)–(f)). The third CME eruption starts with
low–lying runaway tether–cutting reconnection (cf. red star in Figure 12(e) and compact
brightening in Figure 9(a)). The ﬁlament and enveloping ﬂux rope then erupt and drive
further ﬂare reconnection underneath. The ribbons (shown by the yellow colored ovals in
Figures 12(e)–(f) and Figures 10(a)–(c)) and the ﬂare arcade (Figures 9(e)–(f) and Fig-
ures 10(d)–(f)) form as a result of this reconnection. The erupting ﬂux rope blows out the
third CME (CME3 in Figure 12(f) and Figure 11(g)–(i)).

We refer to the stack of three ﬂux ropes above the PIL as a “triple-decker conﬁguration.”
To our knowledge, our work here is the ﬁrst proposing the presence of this triple-decker mag-
netic conﬁguration over the PIL of a bipolar AR from observation and analysis. However,
earlier there were some studies where the evolution of a double-decker ﬁlament system has
been observed (e.g., Liu et al. 2012b; Kliem et al. 2014; Zhu & Alexander 2014). Those stud-
ies suggested two types of double-decker ﬁlament conﬁgurations: in the ﬁrst conﬁguration,
there is a ﬂux rope above the sheared arcades with dips, while in the second conﬁguration two
ﬂux ropes lie stacked over the AR’s PIL, i.e. one over the other (see Figure 12 of Liu et al.
2012b). In our case, i.e., the triple-decker conﬁguration, all three of the ﬂux ropes lie stacked
above the AR’s PIL. The formation of ﬂare ribbons and ﬂare arcades across the same PIL
after each eruption conﬁrms the presence of this magnetic conﬁguration.

It is important to learn how these typical double-decker and triple-decker ﬂux rope
magnetic conﬁgurations form. Two mechanisms for the formation of double-decker ﬁlaments
has been discussed by Liu et al. (2012b). In the ﬁrst possibility the upper branch ﬁrst forms
over the PIL, and the lower branch emerges later to form the double-decker ﬁlament system.
A possible such emergence of a ﬂux rope under a pre-existing ﬁlament has already been
observed (Okamoto et al. 2008).
In the second possibility, initially both branches of the
double-decker ﬁlament system reside close together, and later are separated by a partial

rope splits the ﬁlament ﬂux rope into two branches. In the present study, our observations
suggest the presence of a more complex triple-decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration. We speculate
that the ﬂux ropes may have formed successively via tether cutting at the PIL. We suppose
each ﬂux rope reached some stable coronal height during a conﬁned eruption and remained
there until further eruption. In this supposed process, the stack of three ﬂux ropes over one
another was formed.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onset of solar eruptions, e.g.
runaway tether cutting (Moore et al. 2001), magnetic breakout (Antiochos et al. 1999) and
ﬂux emergence (Chen & Shibata 2000). All these mechanisms are restricted to the erupting
ﬁeld only. In the runaway tether–cutting mechanism, the reconnection begins underneath the
ﬂux rope, internal to the erupting ﬁeld. In the breakout scenario the reconnection begins at
the top, external to the erupting ﬁeld. In the ﬂux–emergence reconnection mechanism, ﬂux
cancellation between existing and emerging nearby ﬁeld triggers the eruption. The eruption
of a double-decker ﬁlament due to the interaction and merging between the two branches
has been proposed in some studies (Zhu & Alexander 2014; Liu et al. 2012b; Kliem et al.
2014). They suggested that the transfer of mass, magnetic ﬂux and current from lower
branch to upper branch during the interaction is the key mechanism for the upper branch
to lose equilibrium. Recently, a new mechanism, referred to as the lid-removal mechanism
(Sterling et al. 2014), has been investigated, where it is proposed that the removal of some of
the overlying ﬁeld (blow out of the top of the envelope ﬁeld) destabilizes the tension–pressure
balance in the underlying ﬁeld. In our case, we observed successive removal of overlying ﬁeld
during the ﬁrst and second CME eruptions that apparently trigger the second and third
CME eruptions, respectively. Thus, our observations support the lid–removal scenario.

The stability of double-decker ﬁlaments using MHD simulation is discussed by Kliem et al.

(2014). In their conﬁguration, they considered two vertically arranged force–free ﬂux ropes
in a bipolar enveloping external ﬁeld. In their simulation, they found that the external ﬁeld’s
toroidal (shear) component is a key parameter controlling the stability of this conﬁguration
if the two ﬂux ropes lie close to each other. The double-decker conﬁguration remains stable if
the strength of the external toroidal (shear) ﬁeld is high. In the case where the toroidal com-

– 24 –

ponent decreases suﬃciently, both ﬂux ropes erupt with the initial eruption of the lower ﬂux
rope. In the case when the shear ﬁeld is above a threshold value, the conﬁguration undergoes
a partial eruption of the higher ﬂux rope. We also expect that the external magnetic ﬁeld
strength is a key factor for stability or eruption in our triple-decker ﬂux rope conﬁguration.
Numerical simulation of such a triple-decker conﬁguration is required to understand more
about the stability/eruption conditions in such conﬁgurations.

So far, it is unclear how common these types of sequential eruptions from a single bipolar
active region may be. The operation of the lid–removal mechanism needs to be modeled
in order to understand fully the eruption scenario. Further observational and numerical
simulation studies are required to improve our insight into triggering of eruptions by lid
removal.
