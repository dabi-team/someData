Abstract

We have developed a novel technique for the measurement of the size of avalanche ﬂuctuations of gaseous detectors using
a gating device (gating foil) prepared for the time projection chamber in the international linear collider experiment
(ILD-TPC). In addition to the gating function, the gating foil is capable of controlling the average fraction of drift
electrons detected after gas ampliﬁcation. The signal charge width and shape (skewness) for electron–ion pairs created
by a pulsed UV laser as a function of the transmission rate of the gating foil can be used to determine the relative
variance of gas gain for single electrons. We present the measurement principle and the result obtained using a stack
of gas electron multipliers (GEMs) operated in a gas mixture of Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%) at atmospheric pressure.
Also discussed is the inﬂuence of the avalanche ﬂuctuations on the spatial resolution of the ILD-TPC.

1. Introduction

Gas ampliﬁcation of the electrons created by X-rays or charged particles plays an essential role in their detection
with gaseous detectors. However, gain ﬂuctuations due to avalanche statistics degrade the spatial resolution of large
Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) [1–3] at long drift distances [4–8] as well as the energy resolution for monochromatic
X-rays.

We are now developing a TPC for the central tracker of the linear collider experiment (ILD-TPC) featuring a
double stack of gas electron multipliers (GEMs) [9] for its gas ampliﬁcation device. The ILD-TPC is required to have
a high spatial resolution of <
100 µm for high momentum charged particles along the pad row direction with a
∼
pad-row height of 5 - 7 mm [10]. The azimuthal spatial resolution (σX) for stiﬀ radial tracks at long drift distances

where B0 is a controllable constant term determined by the pad width and the ampliﬁed charge spread in the GEM
stack, and D denotes the transverse diﬀusion constant of drift electrons while f is the relative variance of the avalanche
ﬂuctuations for single drift electrons, and Nt, the number of drift electrons reaching the sensitive area covered by the
pad row [4].

It is therefore important to make the values of D and 1/Neﬀ, both determined by the choice of the chamber
gas (once the pad-row height is ﬁxed for the latter), small enough to keep the degradation of the spatial resolution
acceptable at the maximum drift length of 2.35 m. We plan to use a gas mixture of Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%)

The size of the avalanche ﬂuctuations has been investigated mathematically [11] or numerically [12] and measured
by many researchers with a variety of gas-ampliﬁcation devices for various ﬁlling gases (see, for example, Refs. [13–22].
A concise review before the emergence of Micromegas [23] and GEM can be found in Section 2 of Ref. [24]. However,
measurements of the avalanche ﬂuctuations in argon-based gases are scarce for GEMs, in particular for double GEM
stacks, which are our current choice, and no literature is available except for our past measurement [25] for a relatively
new gas mixture of Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%), to our knowledge. In addition, we are now using 100-µm thick non-
standard GEM foils to obtain an adequate gas gain with a double GEM stack (see Section 3). We, therefore, carried
out a new measurement to conﬁrm our previous results using diﬀerent techniques (see below).

The most common and straightforward way to study the avalanche ﬂuctuations is to observe directly the gas-
ampliﬁed charge spectrum for single photoelectrons created by irradiating a cathode material by an ultraviolet (UV)
lamp, LED, or laser. However, this technique requires a high gas gain and/or low electronic noise, and a relatively
long measurement time during which the gas density has to be kept constant. It would be much easier if the size of
the avalanche ﬂuctuations can be deduced from the signal charge distribution for a larger number of drift electrons.

We presented such a technique using laser-induced tracks (uniformly-distributed electron–ion pairs), which enabled
the measurements even at low gas gains in around 10 minutes, and without any assumption on the functional form
of the avalanche ﬂuctuations [25]6. Recently, we found yet another technique for the measurement of the size of
avalanche ﬂuctuations in the course of the performance evaluation of a gating device (gating foil) developed for the
ILD-TPC using laser-induced tracks. In addition to the gating function, the gating foil [26] is capable of controlling the
average fraction of drift electrons detected after gas ampliﬁcation. The signal charge width and the shape (skewness)
as function of the average signal charge controlled by the gating foil enabled us to measure the relative variance (f )
of gas gain for single drift electrons. This technique is similar to the measurement of f for the same double GEM
stack operated in Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%) using an 55Fe source and the gating foil presented in the appendix of
Ref. [26].

The next section brieﬂy summarizes the history of the applications of lasers to gaseous detectors, including the
features of our present experiment. The experimental setup and the measurement principle are described respectively
in Sections 3 and 4. The result is given in Section 5. Section 6 is devoted to the discussion and Section 7 concludes
the paper.

2. Brief history of the application of lasers to gaseous detectors

The use of lasers for creating ion pairs in gaseous detectors has a long history. A combination of UV and visible
laser beams was ﬁrst used by Hurst et al. to measure the avalanche ﬂuctuations and the Fano factor with a cylindrical
counter operated in a doped chamber gas [27]. It was then found that a single UV laser could be used for the calibration
of chambers with a gas doped with nickelocene [28].

Shortly after that, J. Bourotte and B. Sadoulet, and H.J. Hilke showed that UV lasers could ionize trace impurities
(natural contaminants) in a chamber gas and could create straight tracks along the laser beam [29, 30]. The ionizations

5The value of h1/Nti is approximately proportional to 1/ hNti, and is about a double of that, for argon-based gas mixtures for a pad-row

height of ∼ 6.3 mm [5].

6Unfortunately, the results presented in Ref. [25] need to be corrected for the charge sharing of the multiplied electrons among the

adjacent pad rows (see Section 6.1).

of undoped chamber gas by UV lasers were shown to be due to double-photon interactions with impurities [31–
33]. Appropriate cleaning (ﬁltering) of the chamber gas made the laser-induced ionizations lower than the detection
sensitivity permanently [33].

The ﬁducial tracks created by a long-focused pulsed UV laser beam have been used for the calibration of drift
chambers including jet chambers and TPCs, and for the measurements of the transport parameters of electrons’ swarm
(see, for example, Refs. [34–37]). Strongly focused laser beams were useful as well for similar purposes using doped
or undoped gas mixtures [38–41]. See Section 2.2 of Ref. [42] for a brief summary and Ref. [43] for details of the
application of UV lasers for the calibration of gaseous detectors.

Attenuated UV laser beams have also been used to measure the avalanche ﬂuctuations using a single or a small
number of photoelectrons from an irradiated metal electrode [19, 20, 22, 44] or from irradiated dopant (TMEA) in the
chamber gas [45].7

We used a UV pulsed laser with long-focus optics and an undoped ﬁlling gas to measure the value of f . In the
measurement, the following features of the application of a laser were exploited: the stability of the pulse energy
(number of photons), and therefore the ionization density, the ﬁxed number of ion pairs (unity) in each of ionization
acts uniformly distributed along the laser beam, and the precise timing of each pulse.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been few measurements of the avalanche ﬂuctuations using a relatively large
number of drift electrons created along laser-induced tracks; see Refs. [27, 46], and [25] for our previous measurements.
All of them relied on the calibration using a soft X-ray source to determine the average density of ion pairs created
along the laser beam. However, the number of ion pairs created by an X-ray source is often not precisely known
especially for ﬁlling gases with eﬃcient Penning transfer [47]. In addition, the collection eﬃciency of drift electrons
has to be taken into account in the case of GEM and Micromegas, for example.

In the present experiment, the asymmetry (skewness) of the charge distribution for laser-induced signals as a
function of the average signal charge was used to avoid the uncertainty in the calibration with an X-ray source
mentioned above.

foils, a readout plane right behind the GEMs, a gating foil in front of them, and a mesh drift electrode to establish a
drift ﬁeld. The electrons created along a laser-induced track are selected by the gating foil, ampliﬁed by the GEMs,
and then collected by the pad rows on the readout plane. The GEM foil is a copper-clad liquid crystal polymer (LCP)
with holes drilled by a laser, supplied by Scienergy Co. Ltd. [48]. The thickness of the LCP is 100 µm and the hole
diameter (pitch) is 70 µm (140 µm).

The transfer and induction gaps of the double GEM stack are 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively. The distance between
the gating foil and the GEM stack is 9.4 mm and is referred to as the transfer region. The electric ﬁelds in the drift

is 345 V (315 V) and the electric ﬁeld in the transfer (induction) gap is 900 V/cm (2700 V/cm), yielding an eﬀective
gas gain of
3700 with a ﬁlling gas mixture of Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%) at atmospheric pressure. Fig. 2 illustrates

Figure 2: Schematic view of the GEM stack and the gating foil [26]. The actual setup is ﬂipped, with the 55Fe source placed at the bottom
(see Fig. 1).

In the previous measurement of the avalanche ﬂuctuations [25], individual signals induced on the pads were read
out through multi-contact connectors arranged on the backside of the readout plane. In the present setup, on the other
hand, the signal charges on the pads located at the area under study are summed on the corresponding connector and
then sent to a preampliﬁer located nearby via a coaxial cable. Thus, the signal charge is measured on a connector-by-
connector basis, instead of a pad-by-pad basis in the previous experiment. The connector reads out signals on 32 pads
19 mm
in adjacent two pad rows (with a pad row height of 5.26 mm), covering an area of approximately 11 mm
on the pad plane. The output of the preampliﬁer is digitized by a CAMAC ADC after signal shaping. The typical
number of ion pairs created along the laser-induced track is 1300 for a single connector (two pad rows). See Ref. [26]
for the gating foil and the details of the experimental setup.

The variation of the average gas gain was not a serious issue in the previous measurement of avalanche ﬂuctua-
tions [25] and in the measurement of the transmission rate of the gating foil [26] since the duration of each run (or set
of runs) was short (typically 10 minutes). On the other hand, the present measurement is based on the whole set of
the laser runs. It was, therefore, important to keep the gas gain as constant as possible. Fig. 3 shows the variations
in the temperature and the pressure during the laser runs.

4. Measurement Principle

In a simple case where the lateral charge spread within the gas ampliﬁcation device is negligibly small compared
to the readout pad (row) height such as in Micromegas, the relative variance of the gas-ampliﬁed signal charge (R2)
is given by

with unity for the Fano factor (F ) [49]. The assumption of Poisson statistics is justiﬁed also for the electrons passing
through the gating foil as naively expected (see Appendix A).

In the detection of laser-induced ionizations by a GEM stack, we have to take into account the charge spread in
the GEM stack as well as the laser energy ﬂuctuations on a pulse-to-pulse basis. The value of R2 is reduced by the
signal charge sharing among adjacent pad rows due to the spread of multiplied electrons in the stack:

connector. The value of g is then about 0.964 in our case where σ/(2

1. The number of created ion pairs is not known precisely enough for the Penning gas mixture used.
2. The collection eﬃciency of the ﬁrst GEM is not measured yet.
3. The leakage of the signal charge is not accurately known since only a small anode area was covered by the

readout connector and the charge deposited on the surrounding area was not recorded in the laser runs.

subtracting the small constant term (C2 = 0.00326). The straight lines shown in the ﬁgures support Eq. (9). It is
worth pointing out that the y-intercept is positive while that in the measurement with an 55Fe source was negative
(see Fig. A.1 in Ref. [26]).

6. Discussion

6.1. Series of our measurements

We have carried out so far three measurements of the avalanche ﬂuctuations for the same GEM stack with the

same gas mixture by means of diﬀerent techniques:

1. using a laser and a pair of readout pad rows [25]
2. using an 55Fe source and the gating foil (Appendix of Ref. [26])
3. using a laser and the gating foil (present paper),

in chronological order.

The presented value of f = 0.63+0.20

−0.16 is consistent with our previous measurements using the diﬀerences between
the laser-induced signal charges on neighboring pad rows recorded on an event-by-event (pulse-by-pulse) basis [25].
It should be noted, however, that the values of f presented in Ref. [25] are underestimates since the reduction factor
g(σ/h) in Eqs. (5) and (7) due to signal charge sharing among adjacent pad rows is not taken into account. The
value of g(σ/h) for σ = 341 µm and h = 5.36 mm (for a single pad row) is about 0.928. Therefore, the values of

8The quality of ﬁtting is high. However, it is not so sensitive to the value of f as far as Eq. (11) is satisﬁed with the measured value of
B. The shape of the signal charge distribution as a whole is, therefore, not a very good observable to be ﬁtted for the determination of
the parameters f and A. In addition, Eq. (28) is an approximate formula (see Appendix E).

If combined with a reliable calibration method the technique applied in the ﬁrst measurement is attractive because
it does not require any a priori assumption on the functional form of the signal charge distribution for single drift
electrons (as with the second technique), and it is virtually free from the pulse-to-pulse laser energy ﬂuctuations (C2

0.06 obtained in the second measurement using an
55Fe source although it is subject to the ambiguities similar to those in the ﬁrst measurement using the laser (see
Appendix of Ref. [26]). It is to be noted that the second technique gives an estimate of the Fano factor as well.

The present result is consistent also with the value of 0.84

±

∼

The third technique presented here assumes a Polya (gamma) distribution for the avalanche ﬂuctuations, but does

not rely on the gain calibration using an 55Fe source (monochromatic soft X-rays).

Finally, it should be pointed out that a measurement similar to the third technique is possible using an optical
device such as a variable ﬁlter or a set of ND ﬁlters as described in Ref. [46], to control the average laser pulse energy.10
In the measurement with an 55Fe source, on the other hand, the gating foil (or a similar device) was indispensable to
control the average fraction of drift electrons contributing to the signal charge, provided that a single monochromatic
X-ray source is used.

6.2. Spatial resolution of the ILD-TPC

Our measurements of the azimuthal spatial resolution of a prototype TPC with triple GEM readout [4] are con-
sistent with the value of Neﬀ estimated with f = 2/3 in Eq. (2) [5]. The assumed value of f is a typical one for a
cylindrical proportional counter operated in an argon-based mixture [53]. Our measurements of f for a double GEM
stack in the same gas mixture of Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%) at atmospheric pressure are also close to the above
value (2/3) although the electric ﬁeld distribution around the ampliﬁcation region for GEMs is diﬀerent from that in
cylindrical counters. The transition of the ﬁeld strength is more abrupt around the entrance of the hole in the ﬁrst
GEM foil. This feature of GEM (and Micromegas) is important to suppress the attachment of drift electrons to CF4
molecules before gas multiplication.11

Nevertheless, the calculated value of f = 0.6 - 0.8 for cylindrical proportional counters [11] seems to be a good
approximation also for a single GEM [21] as well as for Micromegas [19] operated in argon-based gas mixtures.
Moreover, the value of f seems to be rather insensitive to the existence of a Penning admixture (isobutane in our
case). These may be due to the fact that the most part of the avalanche ﬂuctuations is determined in the early stage

9The corrections for the reduction factor g(σ/h) are necessary also for the results presented in Ref. [25] for other gas mixtures.
10It is also possible to vary the laser source power itself by changing the optical output of its ﬂash lamp. However, the stabilization of

laser beam needs some time in that case.

11CF4 molecules are electronegative, though weakly, and dissociatively capture electrons with a kinetic energy between 4.5 eV and
10 eV [54, 55]. In fact, signiﬁcant deterioration of the energy resolution for soft X-rays due to the electron attachment in gases containing
CF4 has been observed with proportional tubes [44, 56, 57] and with an MWPC-equipped TPC [58].

of the gas multiplication in a low ﬁeld region even in GEM or Micromegas (see Section 6.4). The inﬂuence of CF4
molecules that dissociatively capture relatively hot electrons (4.5 eV - 10 eV) at the entrance to the ﬁrst GEM appears
to be small, if any, since the value of Neﬀ is comparable to those obtained with gases without CF4 [4, 59, 60], though
a small loss may have been compensated by the increase in the number of primary electrons due to the Penning eﬀect.
In conclusion, the spatial resolution of the ILD-TPC shown in Fig. 16 of Ref. [4] with f = 2/3 is expected to be

∼

6.3. Digital TPC

If it is possible to detect each of drift electrons separately by a tiny square pad (pixel) on the readout plane after
gas ampliﬁcation one can get rid of the inﬂuence of avalanche ﬂuctuations by assigning 1 to the ﬁred pixels and 0
to the others. For TPCs with such a readout plane (digital TPCs), f in Eq. (2) vanishes and the azimuthal spatial
resolution of a pad row (Eq. (1)) improves. Actually, the concept of pad row does not exist anymore since there is
essentially no favorable track orientation for a readout plane paved over with tiny pads. Consequently, the digital
TPC is free from the resolution degradation due to the angular pad eﬀect [8]. Furthermore, digital recording of the
arrival position and time of each drift electron by tiny pads enables the cluster counting [61] and therefore improves
the accuracy of the speciﬁc energy loss measurements at moderate drift distances where the merge of clusters due to
transverse diﬀusion is not signiﬁcant.12 The digital pixel readout gives a better energy resolution also for soft X-rays
by counting the number of created ion pairs instead of the gas-ampliﬁed total charge [63, 64].

Although the digital TPC concept requires a large number of densely packed readout channels to cover the whole
sensitive volume of a large TPC, promising results have been obtained using a small Micromegas with each mesh hole
aligned to a readout pixel (GridPix) [65].

It should be noted that a small value of f , along with small electronic noise and cross-talks, is advantageous for

the digital readout as well to eﬃciently distinguish ﬁred pixels from those remaining quiet within the noise level.

6.4. Polya distribution

Our measurement of the relative variance relies on the assumption of the Polya (gamma) distribution for the
ﬂuctuations in the size of the avalanche initiated by a single electron (simply referred to hereafter as the avalanche
ﬂuctuations). In this subsection, some consideration is given to the validity of the assumption.

The Polya (gamma) distribution was introduced by Byrne [50, 51], and Lansiart and Morucci [52] in order to explain
the observed peaked distributions for the avalanche ﬂuctuations observed with a cylindrical proportional counter [53]
and with a parallel plate chamber [66]. Their model is based on the assumption that the eﬀective ﬁrst Townsend
coeﬃcient (α′) is given by

α′(n) = α

·

1 +

(cid:18)

θ
n

(cid:19)

(30)

where α is the ﬁrst Townsend coeﬃcient, n denotes the number of electrons contained in the avalanche, and θ is the
model parameter. The continuous Polya distribution (a gamma distribution) is obtained from the discrete distribution
based on α′ using the Stirling formula, with the assumption of a large ﬁnal gain and n

1, n

θ.

The applicability of the Polya (gamma) distribution for parallel plate geometries with a uniform electric ﬁeld was
criticized by Legler [67] from the viewpoint of underlying physics. He showed that the distribution based on his model
with a relaxation distance (x0) reproduced better the avalanche ﬂuctuations observed by Schlumbohm [66] with a
parallel plate chamber, in particular, for small avalanche sizes.

≫

≫

Alkhazov showed then that the i-th moment of the distributions for the Legler type models could be calculated
successively for every i starting from the 0-th moment (unity for the normalization of the probability density function)
and the ﬁrst moment (deﬁned to be unity for the normalized average avalanche size) although they did not give an
approximate analytical function for the avalanche ﬂuctuations such as a gamma function (Polya distribution) for the
Byrne–Lansiart–Morucci model [11]. He compared the moments of a variety of Legler type models (variants) and those
of the Byrne–Lansiart–Morucci model for argon, with the moments given by his own realistic calculation (Eq. (56) in
Ref. [11]) using the relevant cross sections consistent with the measured values of the ﬁrst Townsend coeﬃcient (α),
and found that some of the former gave a better match. He also pointed out the diﬀerence in the asymptotic behavior
of the distribution for small avalanches between the Legler type models and the Byrne–Lansiart–Morucci model.

It is obvious that a photoelectron immediately after leaving the cathode with small kinetic energy needs to travel
at least a ﬁnite distance (x0) along the electric ﬁeld before the ﬁrst ionizing collision with a gas atom or molecule. In

12In the case of Time Expansion Chambers (TECs), with which the cluster counting technique was originally pursued [61, 62], clusters
are separated by drift time. For digital TPCs, they are distinguished by their coordinates on the readout plane (ﬁred pixels) with a time
stamp. Therefore, the clusters can be identiﬁed 3-dimensionally if they are not (completely) declustered.

12

the simple Legler’s model, this is also the case for each of the electron pairs just after an ionizing collision throughout
all stages of the avalanche growth, assuming that both of them have small kinetic energy compared to the ionization
potential of the gas. It should be noted that the basic assumption (Eq. (30)) leading to the Polya (gamma) distribution
implies that photoelectrons are capable of ionizing collision even immediately after the release from the cathode.

The simple Legler’s model (Model 1 in Ref. [11]) is now widely accepted as a conceptual model for the avalanche
ﬂuctuations in parallel plate geometries. The model provides a simple formula for the asymptotic value of f for large
avalanche size as a function of α and a parameter (U0) that deﬁnes the relaxation distance (x0). See Appendix F for
the relative variance of avalanche ﬂuctuations given by the simple Legler’s model.

It was also shown, however, that the Polya (gamma) distribution reproduced very well the avalanche ﬂuctuations
for cylindrical proportional counters up to the fourth moment (with the relative variance ﬁxed to that given by his
realistic calculation) because of the low electric ﬁeld region in the very early stage of the avalanche growth, where
the contribution to the ﬁnal ﬂuctuations is dominant [11].13 The asymptotic behavior of the distribution for small
avalanches is, on the other hand, controlled by the strong electric ﬁeld near the anode wire and small avalanches are
suppressed because of a large value of a/α there (see Appendix F for the deﬁnition of a and the relation between a
and α) [11]. As a consequence, the Polya (gamma) distribution (with an appropriate value of θ) is a good match to
the overall avalanche size distribution. Alkhazov illustrated the development of f , starting from
0 near the cathode,
towards the anode wire of a cylindrical counter given by his simpliﬁed analytical model (Fig. 5 in Ref. [11]). The
analytical model, with an appropriate value of U0, gave the value of f as a function of the average size of the avalanche
close to his realistic calculation (Fig. 6 in Ref. [11]).14

∼

This means that the relative variance and the skewness used in our analysis are reproduced by a Polya (gamma)
distribution for cylindrical counters (operated in argon-based gas mixtures). Conversely, the Legler type models, that
assume parallel-plate geometries, are inappropriate for application to the avalanche ﬂuctuations in nonuniform electric
ﬁelds. It should be pointed out, however, that the physical interpretation of the parameter (θ) of the Byrne–Lansiart–
Morucci model is not as clear as the relaxation distance (x0) in the simple Legler’s model [68].

In short, the Polya (gamma) distribution is a good phenomenological or empirical model for cylindrical counter

geometries to be ﬁtted to the observed signal charge distribution for single drift electrons to obtain the value of f .

In general, gaseous detectors exploiting gas multiplication have a transition region between the conversion/drift
region and the ampliﬁcation region, where the electric ﬁeld lines focus into the latter two- or three-dimensionally,
except for parallel plate chambers. The simple Legler’s model is not applicable (as it is) to those gaseous detectors
with a ﬁeld gradient in the transition region.

An abrupt (step-function like) transition to a strong electric ﬁeld in the ampliﬁcation region is favorable in terms
of the reduction of the avalanche ﬂuctuations [69]. In reality, however, the transition region of the ﬁeld with a ﬁnite
gradient exists even for Micromegas [70], for example. The ﬁeld gradient depends on the detector type (MWPC [71],
MSGC [72], MGC [73], Microdot [74, 75], CGPC [76], CAT [77], Micromegas [23], GEM [9], SGC [78], PMGC [79],
MCAT [80], WELL [81], MGD [82], µWD [83], MIPA [84], MHSP [85], µ-PIC [86, 87], THGEM [88], µ-RWELL [89]
etc.), and its geometry and operating high voltages.15 The ﬁeld gradient could therefore be quite diﬀerent from that
in cylindrical counters considered by Alkhazov [11]. Nevertheless, the Polya (gamma) distribution has been success-
fully or satisfactorily employed to ﬁt the avalanche ﬂuctuations obtained with various gaseous detectors including
Micromegas [14, 19, 20] and a single GEM [16, 18, 21]. The avalanche ﬂuctuation of a GEM stack is determined
mostly by the ﬁrst stage GEM as far as its eﬀective gain is large enough. Hence, if the Polya (gamma) distribution
is a good approximation for single GEMs so is expected for GEM stacks. See Appendix G for an evaluation of the
avalanche ﬂuctuations in a double GEM stack.

A gamma distribution (α = 3/2, β = 1) was ﬁrst used by Curran et al. to be ﬁtted to the avalanche ﬂuctuations for
single photoelectrons observed with a cylindrical proportional counter [53]. It should be noted that ﬁtting by a function
(analytical or not) is necessary in many cases to estimate the relative variance by extrapolating the distribution to
the region dominated by the electronic noise (pedestal region) for small signals16, and to the region limited by the
ampliﬁer’s dynamic range or the ADC overﬂows for large signals.

13He suggested also that Penning admixtures were less eﬀective to reduce the avalanche ﬂuctuations than in a uniform electric ﬁeld due

to the same reason.

14His analytical approach is instructive. It should be noted, however, that the calculation is based on the diﬀerential equation (Eq. (51)
in Ref. [11]) justiﬁed for uniform and weak electric ﬁelds. Nevertheless, it is clear that a higher electric ﬁeld at the very early stage of the
gas ampliﬁcation gives smaller ﬁnal avalanche ﬂuctuations (f ) because the asymptotic value (f0) is a decreasing function of the electric
ﬁeld when it is moderate (see Appendix F).

15The ﬁeld gradient may be made larger with a smaller aperture of the mesh for Micromegas [70] or a smaller hole diameter for GEM
(see, for example, Fig.3 in Ref. [90]). But care must be taken not to lose drift electrons in the mesh or the upper electrode especially under
a strong axial magnetic ﬁeld.

16This is the case also when a self-trigger mode is used to discriminate small signals indistinguishable from the noise.

13

Needless to say, this is not the whole story of the issue ever since the middle of the last century. See review articles
such as Ref. [91] and Section 2 of Ref. [24] for its history. Our conclusion at the moment is that the Polya (gamma)
distribution is expected to be a good approximation, if not the best, for the avalanche ﬂuctuations of GEM stacks.

It should be pointed out that most of the mathematical approaches postulate the following.

1. Electron avalanche develops only by impact ionizations, without the contribution of UV photons by the photo-

electric eﬀect.

2. Space-charge eﬀect is negligible.
3. One-dimensional treatment is justiﬁed, ignoring lateral diﬀusion.
4. Electric ﬁeld gradient is moderate.
5. Filling gas atom/molecule has a simple structure (cross sections to the electrons) like rare gas atoms.

In reality, however, some could be inappropriate. For micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs), (3) and (4) may be
the bold assumptions. The electric ﬁeld experienced by the electrons approaching the ampliﬁcation region depends
on their paths, and they do not exactly follow the electric ﬁeld lines because of diﬀusion. Furthermore, the local
ﬁeld gradient may be too large for electrons to be assumed in equilibrium with the local electric ﬁeld (the value of α
dependent only on the local electric ﬁeld)17, or in the process to reach the equilibrium at a rate given by the local
electric ﬁeld and the average avalanche size there (see, for example, Eq. (51) in Ref. [11]).

An alternative way free from most of the restrictions of the mathematical approaches is the Monte-Carlo simulation
of the motion of drifting electrons at the atomic level in 3-dimensional space, with all the relevant cross sections taken
into account [12]. It follows the microscopic path of the individual electron in an avalanche under a given electric
(and magnetic) ﬁeld that may vary signiﬁcantly during its free path, for any electrode conﬁgurations in virtually any
gas mixtures. Potentially, it can include any physical processes neglected (or roughly approximated) so far such as
the Penning eﬀect. The microscopic Monte-Carlo simulation of avalanches is a promising approach, but is beyond the
scope of the present paper.

6.5. Future prospects

The proof of principle has been demonstrated for the new technique to measure the avalanche ﬂuctuations, and the
underlying mathematics is clear. The presented measurement error is large because of the relatively large electronic
noise. The noise is mostly induced by the laser and is synchronized to each laser shot (see footnote 12 of Ref. [26]).
We are now preparing a dedicated smaller chamber with reduced electronic noise, along with a new laser and optical
system.

The new laser may be placed away from the chamber to reduce pick-up from the laser discharge [30]. If it is diﬃcult
to suppress the noise suﬃciently we can increase the drift distance of the laser-induced tracks to delay the laser signals
to avoid the overlap with the laser-induced noise.

The new technique, as well as that presented in Ref. [25], will be applied to study the avalanche ﬂuctuations for

other ﬁlling gases as well, such as neon-based mixtures, in which the vale of f is expected to be smaller.

7. Conclusion

In the course of performance evaluation of a gating device well suited for TPCs based on a Micro-Pattern Gaseous
Detector (MPGD), we found a novel technique for the measurement of the avalanche ﬂuctuations of gaseous detectors
using UV laser-induced tracks and the gating foil. The relative variance of avalanche ﬂuctuations (f ) was estimated
from the relative signal width and the skewness as function of (the inverse of) the average signal charge, assuming
a Polya (gamma) distribution for the gas-ampliﬁed signal charge created by single drift electrons. The skewness of
the signal charge distribution as a function of the average signal charge controlled by the gating foil can be used to
estimate the average number of detected drift electrons, instead of the calibration using an 55Fe source that could be
inaccurate because of the ambiguity in the W-value of ﬁlling gas and/or the collection eﬃciency of gas-ampliﬁcation
device. Conversely, one can determine the average number of ion pairs created by an 55Fe source, for example, in
Penning gas mixtures for which the W-value is not precisely known if the collection eﬃciency is given by measurement
or simulation.

The applied method gives a reasonable value of the relative variance: f = 0.63+0.20

−0.16 for a double GEM stack
3700, which is consistent with our previous

operated in a gas mixture of Ar-CF4 (3%)-isobutane (2%) at a gas gain of

measurements. The measured values of f including our previous ones are close to 2/3, which was assumed in the
expected azimuthal resolution of the ILD-TPC for radial tracks better than 100 µm presented in Ref. [4]. The value
of f = 0.6 - 0.8 calculated for cylindrical proportional counters operated in argon-based gases [11] seems to be a
good estimate also for Micromegas [19], a single GEM [21], and our double GEM stack. It is, therefore, possible to
achieve the required azimuthal spatial resolution of <
100 µm for radial tracks over the entire sensitive volume of
∼
the ILD-TPC.

The measurement accuracy of the present experiment is dominated by the extrapolation error of the skewnesses of
signal charge distributions, and is expected to be improved by reducing the electronic noise. We are now preparing a
smaller test chamber and a new laser and optical system for the measurements with a better precision under improved
conditions including a better signal to noise ratio.

Appendix A. Binomial selection from the uniform distribution

The electrons liberated by the laser beam drift to the front surface of the GEM stack after passing through the
gating foil. Let us consider the distribution of the number of electrons reaching the surface area of the GEM stack
right above a pad row. We assume a uniform (and random) spatial distribution of single electrons along the laser
beam around its focal point, i.e. around the pad-row position. In addition, the diﬀusion of drifting electrons is ignored
since it does not alter the nature of uniform distributions.

For a ﬁxed number of the electrons reaching the surface of the gating foil above the pad row (n0), the probability

to ﬁnd n electrons getting through the foil is given by

n0!
n! (n0 −
where p represents the average transmission rate of the gating foil. Since n0 obeys Poisson statistics with a mean
the probability mass function of n is given by a compound Poisson-binomial distribution (with ν

coeﬃcient [50–52, 92]. The Polya distribution for non-negative integers is a versatile distribution closely related to other ones including
the gamma distribution. See, for example, Ref. [93] for the Polya distribution (a negative binomial distribution with a real number of
failures) and its relations to other discrete and continuous distributions. In addition, it is interesting to note that Eq. (B.32) is identical
to the probability density function of the distance to the (1 + θ)-th nearest neighbor in a uniform distribution with an average interval
of 1/(1 + θ), i.e. the Erlang distribution with a real shape parameter. For the ﬁrst neighbor (θ = 0) it gives the expected exponential
distribution.

We evaluate here the inﬂuence of the hole-to-hole variation of the average gas gain within a simpliﬁed virtual GEM
foil, on the width of the total number of electrons detected by a readout pad row (or a pair of pad rows, in our case)
in the laser experiment.

Let us assume that there are inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimal GEM holes along the laser induced tracks and a set

Appendix D. Relative variance and skewness of the laser-induced ionizations

In this appendix, we estimate the expected values of the relative variance and the skewness of the distribution of
the number of laser-induced ionizations in a small interval along the laser beam covered by the readout pad row(s)
(∆z). In the following, a simple model is assumed for the ionization process:

1. The laser-induced ionization is caused by a double-photon interaction with an unidentiﬁed impurity molecule in
the ﬁlling gas via an intermediate excited state with a lifetime much longer than the duration of a laser pulse,
but shorter than the pulse interval [43].

2. The impurity molecules are assumed to be at rest (stationary targets), like in a still picture taken with a short
exposure time, because their thermal diﬀusion (random walk distance) during the pulsed laser irradiation is
small. This means that the excitation and possible subsequent ionization occur in the same spot.

3. The laser ﬂux is moderate and its duration is short enough so that the vast majority of the impurity molecules

stay at the ground state during the irradiation.

We assume a simple model also for the pulsed laser beam, that allows separation (and disregard) of relevant
variables. Let us set φ(x, z, t; t∗) to be the local photon ﬂux (photons/unit area/sec) where x
(x, y), with the
≡
z-coordinate axis along the laser beam, t denotes time in the duration of a pulse measured from its start time (t∗).
for a function of t∗ in the following
The discrete variable t∗ is the time stamp for each pulse and the symbol
denotes the average over pulses.

h· · · i

First, we neglect its z-dependence in a small interval ∆z:

φ(x, z, t; t∗) = φ(x, t; t∗)

(D.1)

at any given time (t) during a pulse. Next, we suppose that the time dependence of photon ﬂux is independent of x:

φ(x, t; t∗) = f (x; t∗)

a(t)

T

a(t) dt = 1

(D.2)

(D.3)

where T denotes the duration of pulses. It should be noted that the function a(t) is bell-shaped with a peak near the
middle of the pulse duration, and with a small positive skewness in our case. Its duration is about 3-4 nsec at FWHM,
which corresponds to the width in space (beam length) of
1 m (FWHM) along z-axis. Therefore, the z-dependence
∼
of the ﬂux at any given t is small and Eq. (D.1) is expected to be a reasonable approximation since the beam length
is large compared to ∆z (

10 mm, in our case).

Finally, the shape of photon density in the x-y plane is assumed to be identical for all the pulses:

∼

where f0(x) is the local ﬂuence at x averaged over pulses with

In short, we consider repeated irradiations on a thin layer of impurity molecules by a series of laser pulses with an
identical shape of the beam proﬁle, and with each being characterized only by the total number of photons, except
for the statistical ﬂuctuations in the number of photons distributed to each section in the proﬁle.

Now, let us consider the probability that an impurity molecule staying at x is ionized in a time interval [t2, t2 + ∆t]
measured from the beginning of a pulse (t∗). We deﬁne σex to be the cross section of the impurity molecule for the
transition from the ground state to the excited state, and σi to be that for the transition from the excited state to the
ionized (continuum) state. Since the molecule needs to have been excited before t2 the probability is given by

The same results can be obtained easily by assuming a simple structure of the pulsed laser beam, i.e. a rectangular
distribution both in space and time. This simpliﬁcation is justiﬁed because the laser beam proﬁle in the x-y plane
at any given time during a pulse can be assumed to be a set of independent square column-like distributions like a
lego plot as far as the impurity molecules are stationary targets, and the number of local ionizations n(x, t∗) does not
depend on the shape of time structure (a(t′), see Eq. (D.17)) including a uniform (rectangular) distribution.

Appendix F. Avalanche ﬂuctuations given by the Legler’s model and the gain stability

In this appendix, we discuss the minimum possible value of avalanche ﬂuctuations and the gas-gain stability for a
perfect parallel-plate geometry based on the Legler’s model [67, 68]. The simple model given by Legler supposes that

27

the electric ﬁeld is not too high and the kinetic energy of electrons before an ionizing collision is not too large so that
the two electrons just after the ionization have a small amount of kinetic energy compared to the ionization potential
of the gas. It should be kept in mind that this condition is assumed to be fulﬁlled in the following argument even
under high reduced electric ﬁelds (E/N ) with N , the density of gas atoms and/or molecules. In addition, only impact
ionizations (free from space-charge eﬀects) are assumed even for large gas gains.

The asymptotic relative variance of the size of avalanches initiated by an electron, in the limit of large average

size, is given by [11]

See, for example, Fig. 3 in Ref. [11] for the ionization eﬃciencies (η) of argon and methane as function of E/N . The

It is a common practice to add a hydrocarbon gas to a rare gas as a quencher for UV photons created in electron
avalanches. The hydrocarbon quencher (isobutane in our case) cools down electrons in the avalanche by its large
inelastic cross sections to relatively low-energy electrons. On the other hand, it helps avalanche growth when its
ionization potential is lower than the potential energies of the excited states of the rare gas atom by the Penning
eﬀect [47]. The net eﬀect of adding a hydrocarbon quencher can be the increase of gas gain when its concentration is
small enough so that its role as a Penning agent is more eﬃcient than as a moderator. A small amount of isobutane in
our gas mixture drastically decreases the operating high voltages of GEMs (see, for example, Figs. 6 and 7 in Ref. [4]).
In this case, the ratio of the energy spent for ionizations to that supplied to the electrons by the electric ﬁeld increases,
thereby decreasing the value of f0. In addition, the number of ion pairs created by 5.89 keV photons (Ne) is expected
to increase with a reduced W -value [102]. Hence, the energy resolution for the main peak of 55Fe given by Eq. (F.16)
is expected to improve as far as the photoelectric eﬀect due to UV photons is well suppressed.

Appendix G. Avalanche ﬂuctuations for a double GEM stack

In this appendix, we present an approximate estimate for the relative variance of the response of a double GEM
stack to single electrons. We assume a perfect stack of GEMs with identical holes in the ﬂat and uniform foil, and
constant gaps between the GEMs and between the second GEM and a readout plane. The estimation can readily be
extended for a stack of three or more GEMs.

G.1. Response of a single GEM to multiple electrons

Let n and σn be the number of incoming electrons and their ﬂuctuations. The electrons are gas-ampliﬁed through

the following processes:

1. Collection into a GEM holes with an eﬃciency p1

25For pure neon η∗ ∼ 0.0149 at E ∼ 65 kV/cm·atm [96], giving the minimum of f0 ∼ 0.24 with U0 = Ui = 21.56 eV [98].

29

2. Gas multiplication with a gain M (absolute gain)
3. Extraction to the transfer or induction gap with an eﬃciency p2.

We assume binomial statistics for both the collection and extraction processes. In addition, independent binomial
selections are assumed for the extraction process and the subsequent collection process in the case of double GEMs
considered later. See Fig. G.1 for the notation to be used.

G.3. Evaluation for a typical double GEM stack

Let us assume the absolute gas gains of the two GEM foils are identical just for simplicity (

RV ar (M ′) = RV ar (M )). Then the relative variance of a double-GEM stack is given by

Let us further assume typical values for the extraction and collection eﬃciencies [103]: p2 = p′
and 170 for the absolute gas gain (

(

). The assumed total eﬀective gain is then close to that of our GEM stack

3700).
If we put a typical value of 2/3 for RV ar (M ) Eq. (G.38) yields

0.69 for the total relative variance under the
conditions mentioned above. The relative variance is dominated by that of the ﬁrst stage and the contribution of the

26Strictly speaking, the sum of the two terms depends on the relative alignment of the GEM holes in the upper and lower GEMs, as well
as on the diﬀusion of ampliﬁed electrons in the transfer gap. The holes are usually neither aligned nor completely misaligned. Therefore,
the assumption is justiﬁed when the diﬀusion in the transfer gap is large compared to the GEM hole pitch. It is to be noted that this
is not always the case; the diﬀusion is about 265 µm in standard deviation whereas the GEM hole pitch is 140 µm for our GEM stack.
Fortunately, the contribution of the transfer eﬃciency ﬂuctuations is suppressed by the eﬀective gain of the ﬁrst GEM (p2 · hM i).
