Abstract  
An  analytical  inactivation  cross  section  formula  based  on  the  analytical 

formula for calculating the radial dose distribution of Awad et al. (Awad et 

al., 2018) was proposed. The formula is a multi-hit model based on the track 

structure theory of Katz that was not updated since Katz and co-workers in 

1970s-1980s.  The  formula  was  solved  numerically  to  calculation  the 

inactivation cross section, σ and action cross section for double strand break, 

σDSB  for  the  two  strains  of  the  vegetative  E.  coli  cells  (BS-1  and  B/r) 

bombarded with heavy ions of  O, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Au, Pb and U of energy 

between  1.1  to  19.4  MeV/n.  The  response  of  the  cell  and  hence  the 

corresponding  inactivation  cross  section  is  affected  by  m,  the  number  of 

targets  that  must  be  inactivated  per  cell;  D0,  the  characteristic  x  or  γ-ray 

dose;  a0,  the  target  radius  and  Rmax,  the  maximum  range  travelled  by  the 

liberated  δ-ray  in  the  medium.  The  variations  in  the  inactivation  cross 

section  in  terms  of  these  parameters  were  studied.  The  model  predicts  the 

available measured inactivation cross sections data for E. coli cells (BS-1 and 

B/r), σ as well as the double strand break, σDSB ones with good accuracy. It 

was  found  that  as  the  ion  charge  increases  as  the  inactivation  probability 

increases  and  the  corresponding  inactivation  cross  section  of  the  ion 

increases.

Introduction 

Effect of radiation on DNA  and biological tissues is old/new subject 

and  is  always  gain  interest  in  the  past,  present  and  future.  In  radiation 

biology,  the  amorphous  track  model  was  introduced  in  1960s  of  the  last 

century  (Butts and Katz,1967; Kobetich and Katz, 1968; Katz et al., 1971) 

and its reduction model, the local effect model (LEM) by Scholz and Kraft 

(Scholz and Kraft, 1994; Scholz and Kraft, 1996; Scholz et al., 1997) were 

used  to  calculate  the  biological  effect  of  charged  particles.  The  two 

biophysical models are widely accepted and have been used to calculate the 

effect of radiation on cells and inactivation cross section of ions to enzymes 

and viruses in the last few decades.  The two approaches are almost similar 

and  the  difference  between  them  mostly  lies  in  the  concept  of  local  dose 

(Scholz and Kraft) and average dose (Katz) and the definition of the target 

size. In LEM cell inactivation is assumed to be due to production of lethal 

events  of  certain  number  in  a  specific  sensitive  location  (the  cell  nucleus). 

No  interactions  of  sub  lethal  damages  over  large  distances  of  the  order  of 

micrometers are required to produce lethal events. The present calculations, 

however, is based on  the  ion kill-gamma  kill  model of Katz. In which,  the 

effects  produced  by  secondary  electrons  from  γ-rays  and  those  from 

secondary  electrons  from  heavy  ion  (δ-rays)  are  comparable  at  the  same 

dose.  Two  radiation  actions  were  incorporated,  γ-kill  and  ion-kill  and  this 

makes it is possible to explain the difference between the effect of low and 

high-LET radiation.  

Modeling  and  predicting  the  radial  dose  D(r,R)  as  a  function  of  the 

radial distance, r from the ion pass and δ-ray range, R in a given medium is 

essential  for  calculating  the  ion  inactivation  cross  section.  The  radial  dose 

3 

 
distribution  due  to  ion  interaction  with  a  given  medium,  D(r,R)  was  first 

introduced by Butts and Katz in the 1960s (Butts and Katz, 1967; Kobetich 

and Katz, 1968) using a simple empirical electron range-energy relationship. 

This  pioneer  approach  by  Katz  and  co-workers  led  to  formulate  many 

biophysical  models.  It  is  worth  noting  that  calculating  D(r,R)  models  had 

many  modifications  and  improvement  during  the  last  few  decades  (Katz, 

1978;  1983;  1985;  Zhang  et  al.,  1985;  Waligórski  et  al.,  1986;  Kiefer  and 

Straaten, 1986; Cucinotta et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1994; Chan and Kellerer, 

1997;  Cucinotta  et  al.,  1997;  Cucinotta  et  al.,  1999,  Korcyl,  2012; 

Waligórski et al., 2015 (a,b) and Awad et al., 2018). For more information, 

please refer to these references and references therein. Radial dose, D(r,R) is 

utilized  for  radiation  transport  software  (Bernal  et  al.,  2015),  developing  a 

treatment  planning  system  and  estimating  the  cell  survival  rate  in  the 

treatment planning system for heavy particle cancer therapy (Waligórski et 

al.,  2015-b;  Nikjoo et  al.,  2016)  and  predict the  cell  surviving rate and the 

relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the ions (Waligórski et al., 2015-

a). 

Measuring the inactivation cross section, σ induced by heavy ions on 

viruses,  bacteria  and  DNA  were  carried  out  by  many  authors  in  the 

literature. For SV-40 virus in EO buffer, σ was carried out experimentally as 

well  as  theoretically  (Katz  and  Wesely;  1991).  Inactivation  and  mutagenic 

effect  in  spores  of  Bacillus  subtilis  (B.  Subtilis)  irradiated  with  heavy  ions 

were  investigated  by  Baltschukat  and  Horneck  (Baltschukat  and  Horneck, 

1991). Dose dependent decline in surviving fraction in Chines hamster V79 

cells exposed to high LET ions has been studied by Pathak et al. (Pathak et 

al., 2007). Experimental and theoretical cross sections for E. coli mutants B, 

4 

 
B/r,  and  BS-1  after  irradiated  by  Heavy-Ion  Irradiation  were  studied  (Katz 

and Zachariah, 1993). Inactivation cross section of ions for dry enzymes and 

viruses were calculated using an empirical formula (Liu et al., 1994 and Liu 

et  al.,  1996).  Heavy  ions  induced  inactivation  and  mutagenic  effect  in 

microorganisms such as yeast cells which provide astronauts needs in active 

space exploration was studied (Wang el al., 2010). Quantitative analysis of 

radio-induced  DNA  damage  exposed  to  protons  at  Bragg-peak  energy  was 

given by Souici et al., (Souici et al., 2017). 

The  aim  of  the  present  work  is  to  calculate  the  inactivation  cross 

section,  σ  using  a  new  analytical  formula.  This  formula  is  based  on  the 

analytical  approach  proposed  by  Awad  et  al.  (Awad  et  al.,  2018)  for 

calculating  the  radial  dose  distribution  D(r,R).  The  formula  is  a  multi-hit 

model  based  on  the  track  structure  theory  of  Katz  and  is  considered  as  an 

alternative to Monte Carlo code for calculating the radial dose distribution in 

a  given  medium  due  to  the  passing  charged  ion.  The  calculations  were 

carried  out  for  two  strains  of  Bacterial  cells  of  E.Coli.  Estimating  the 

inactivation cross sections, σ  for the two  strains (Bs-1  and B/r) E. coli  cells 

bombarded with heavy ions of  O, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Au, Pb and U of energy 

between  1.1  to  19.4  MeV/n  were  carried  out.  In  addition  to  calculate  the 

induction double strand break cross section, σDSB for those two strains. The 

different  parameters  that  affect  σ  of  m,  D0,  a0  and  Rmax  were  studied.  The 

calculated  inactivation  cross  sections  were  as  compared  to  the  measured 

ones. The inactivation probability for each ion was studied.

Experimental data 

The present calculations  were  compared to data  that  obtained from  a  well-

designed experiment in which different ions of different charges with almost 

similar  energy/n  were  utilized  to  irradiate  the  samples.  Samples  of  two 

strains (BS-1 and B/r) of the vegetative cells of Escherichia coli (E. coli) of 

almost  similar  DNA  structure  were  used  (Schäfer  et  al.,  1994).  They  are 

considered as a simple test system to measure the induction of DNA double 

strand breaks (DSB) and their correlation with cell survival dependent on the 

radiation quality. The two E. coli strains were bombarded with heavy ions of 

Ne, Ar, Kr, Au, Pb and U.  The inactivation cross section and double strand 

break cross section were  measured.  Another inactivation cross section  data 

for  BS-1  and  B/r  E.  coli  bombarded  with  O,  Ne  and  Xe  were  obtained 

(Schäfer  et  al.,  1987)  were  added.  Table  2  compile  the  different  ions  of 

energy  between  1.1  to  19.4  MeV/n  quoted  in  the  present  work  and  there 

references.  Schäfer et al 1994 data will be superimposed in the present work 

as (Exp), while Schäfer et al., 1987 data will be quoted as (Exp report). 

Methodology  

Inactivation (loss of colony forming ability) of enzymes, bacteria and 

viruses  by  energetic  heavy  ions  gained  large  interest  and  still,  therefore, 

many  approaches  were  suggested  for  calculating  the  inactivation  cross 

section.  Calculating inactivation probability, P  and σ is mainly depends on 

the 

  ratio.  For  each  D(r,R)  formula  there  is  inactivation  cross  section 

formula. Therefore, there are Katz (Butts and Katz; 1867), Zhang (Zhang et 

6 

 
 
      
  
al., 1985); Waligόrski (Waligόrski et al., 1987); Cucinotta (Cucinotta et al., 

1997)  as  well  as  Waligόrski  (Korcyl,  2012;  Waligόrski  et  al.,  2015) 

approaches.  The  present  calculations  (will  call  it  Calc)  work  will  be 

compared  with  Katz  and  Zhang  calculations  (Zhang  et  al.,  1985)  and  will 

call it (Katz and Zhang).   

The  multi-hit  inactivation  cross  section  is  a  statistical  model   

introduced by Katz (Katz et al., 1971; Katz et al., 1996). In that model it was 

assumed  that  the  effects  produced  by  secondary  electrons  from  γ-rays  and 

those  from  secondary  δ-electrons  from  heavy  ions  are  comparable  at  the 

same dose. Therefore, the probability for producing effects in a macroscopic 

volume  by  a  given  dose  of  γ-rays  in  the  target  was  used  to  estimate  the 

probability of producing effects in that target by a charged ion as follows:  

 (

)

                                      (1) 

where,  D0  is  the  γ-ray  dose  for  37%  survival  of  the  cell  and  D(r,R)  is  the 

average  radial  dose  over  the  target  volume.  D(r,R)  is  assumed  to  be  the 

energy deposited per unit mass in a short cylinder of radius a0, whose axis is 

parallel to the path of  the ion.  A  semi-empirical analytical model  based on 

electronic  radiation  damage  is  introduced  by  (Awad  et  al.,  2018)  for 

calculating  the  radial  dose  distribution  D(r,R),  In  this  approach,  the 

empirical electron range-energy formula of Tabata et al. (Tabata et al., 1972) 

was considered where the electron range, R in cm is given as: 

                                 (

bi (i=1,2,…,9) are constants independent of absorber material and are given 

in Table 1.  T is the energy of the ejected δ-electrons and its maximum value 

as a function of β (the ion velocity in medium relative to velocity of light in 

vacuum) is given by:  

                                             (3) 

The  second  important  step  is  to  calculate  the  electron  energy  in  MeV  as  a 

function of the electron range in cm. The inverse of the energy-range of Eq. 

(2) was found by Tabata et al. (Tabata, et al., 1972) as follows:  

                                                      ( 

   )                  (4)               

where  ci  (i=1,2…5)  are  constant  for  a  given  target  (ZT,  AT)  and  di 

(i=1,2,…,9) are another constants independent of absorber material and are 

given in Table 1 as:   

These  two steps  are  important  for defining the necessary  constants  and  for 

more  details,  please  refer  to  Awad  et  al.,  2018.  Finally,  the  radial  dose,  

        depends on r and R and its formula was defined as follows:

 The  inactivation  probability  thus  can  be  determined  by  using  Eq.  (5)  for 

D(r, R) and hence, the inactivation cross section, σ for a given ion is given 

as follows:

where, m represents the number of targets in the cell which must be hit and 

inactivated by radiation to produce an observable effect in such cell. For one 

hit detectors m = 1 i.e. a single hit in a single target suffices to inactivate the 

detector. For biological cells m is frequently 2 or more (Katz et al., 1996).  

An algorithm was constructed to calculate the double integration of σ

Barkas’ formula as                    

   and β were incorporated in the 

calculation as well as the target parameter of        

    where the E. Coli 
density was considered as a water medium. The two integration limits were 

carried out in such a way that  the  down limit for  the second integration is 

Rmin and the upper limit is Rmax are the limits for radial dose estimation (Eq. 

5). For the first integration that is given in Eq. 11, the lower limit is taken as 

1 nm and the upper limit is less than or equal Rmin of the first integration. It 

is worth noting that, the first integration is the target radius a0.  

3. Results 

3.1 Parameters affecting inactivation cross section calculations 

The response of the E. coli cells (BS-1 and B/r) to the bombarded ions 

was studied through investigating the inactivation cross section of these cells 

using  Eq.  11.  Equation  11  was  solved  numerically  to  calculation  the 

inactivation cross section, σ and induction double strand break cross section, 

σdsb  for  the two  strains  of  the  vegetative  cell  of  E.  coli  cells  (Bs-1  and  B/r) 

bombarded with heavy ions of  O, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Au, Pb and U of energy 

between  1.1  to 19.4  MeV/n.  The  data  for  each strain  will be demonstrated 

and discussed separately later on. 

Inactivation cross section  depends on four parameters (m, D0, a0 and 

Rmax).  The  number  of  targets  that  must  be  hit  by  radiation  to  cause  an 

observable effect (inactivate) per cell is m. D0 is the characteristic dose and 

it is the γ-ray or x-ray dose for 37% of cell survival, a0 is the target radius 

and  finally,  Rmax  is  the  maximum  δ-electrons  range  corresponding  to  the 

11 

 
 
  
 
maximum δ-ray energy transferred due to the energetic charged ion (Eq. 3) 

and it is the upper limit for the second integration in Eq. 11. In this part, the 

effect  of  these  parameters  on  σ  will  be  discussed  and  inactivating  of  B/r 

E.coli cells by Argon ion will be presented as an example.  The variation in 

σ with the ion energy at different m values of m=1,2,3,4 and 5 and at D0=61 

Gy and target radius, a0=0.2 µm is shown in Fig. 1. One can observe that, the 

inactive  cross  section  decreases  with  m  and  m=2  gives  the  best  fit  in  this 

case. It was found that σ is very sensitive to m and m=2 give the best fit for 

σ  for  the  two  E.  coli  cells  (B  and  B/r)  and  m=3  give  the  best  fit  for  the 

double strand break action cross section, σDSB for E. coli cell DNA.   

Inactivation  cross  section  as  a  function  the  Ar  energy  for  different 

target  radius  of  a0=0.1,  0.2,  0.3  and  0.5  µm  and  at  m=2  and  D0=61  Gy  is 

illustrated in Fig.2. It can be seen that, at low energy (less than  ≈8 Mev/n) 

the target radius is slightly effective while for energy greater than 8 MeV/n 

is a0 is not changing σ significantly. It was found that target radius that gives 

best  fit  to  the  experimental  data  is  at  a0=  0.2  µm  (200  nm).  Therefore,  all 

targets radii will be fixed at 0.2 µm.   

Regarding the characteristic dose, D0 the inactivation cross section for 

B/r E. coli cell was studied at different Ar energy and at different D0 values, 

see  Fig.  3.  One  can  observe  that  D0  values  are  significantly  changed  the 

obtained inactivation cross section and σ is very sensitive to D0. In opposite 

to previous study, the present work was fitting the inactivation cross section 

using different D0 values for each ion. The previous studies, were fixing D0 

value  for  all  ions.  Table  3  is  gathering  the  characteristic  dose,  D0  for  the 

different ions in comparison with the literature D0 values for both vegetable 

E. coli cells.    

11 

 
Table  4  as  well  as  Fig.4  demonstrates  the  effect  of  Rmax,  the  upper 

integration  limit  on  inactivating  B/r  E.  coli  cells  at  different  Ar  energy. 

Using  the  full  δ-ray  range  (Rmax)  that  was  deduced  using  Eq.  3  and  Eq.  2 

gives progressive cross section values. It was found that at energy between 2 

to 10 MeV/n the deduced Rmax using Eq. 3 and Eq. 2 fits most of the studied 

data,  however,  a  problem  exist  in  the  region  above  10  MeV/n  where  the 

calculated  σ  cannot  fit  the  experimental  data  at  such  high  energy  regions. 

Therefore,  many  efforts  and  by  using  trial  and  error  method,  the  present 

work  suggested  Rmax  values  that  fit  most  of  the  studied  experimental  data 

and is given in Table 4.  

3.2 BS-1 E. coli inactivation cross section 

In  the  energy  range  2-20  MeV/n,  the  present  model  calculated  the 

inactivation  cross  section  for  BS-1  E.  coli  cells  bombarded  with  O  and  Ne 

ions  using  the  fitting  parameters  m=2,  a0=0.2  µm  and  D0=  12.5  Gy  (see 
Table 3).  σ (µm2) as a function of O and Ne energy was plotted in Fig. 5. 

Good agreement between the present calculations and the experimental data 

for O (O, Exp.) and Ne (Ne, Exp.) data and it is  closer to Zhang and Katz 

calculations for O as well.  Similarly, the experimental data for BS-1 E. coli 

cells  strike  by  Ar  and  Kr  at  different  energies  are  well  predicted  by  the 

present model, Fig.6. Table 3 compiles the implemented model parameters. 

The  present  calculations  as  well  as  the  experimental data  are  in  agreement 

with calculated data by Katz and Zhang for both ions.  

Fig.  7  and  Fig.  8  present  a  comparison  between  experimental 

inactivation cross section for BS-1 E. coli cells bombarded by Pb, Au, Xe and 

U ions.  The fitting parameters for these ions are compiled in Table 3.  One 

12 

 
 
can  observe  that  as  the  ion  charge  increases  as  the  cross  section  of 

inactivation 

increases.  Reasonable  matching  between 

the  present 

calculations and the  experimental data  at both low and high energy part  in 

agreement with Katz and Zhang calculations as well.    

3.3 B/r E. coli inactivation cross section  

The present model is able to predict the inactivation cross section for 

B/r E. coli cells bombarded by heavy ions quit well in comparison with both 

experimental  and  Katz  and  Zhang  calculations.  It  must  emphasis  that 

inactivation  cross  section  for  B/r  E.  coli  cells  was  carried  out  using  target 

radius, a0=0.2 µm and m=2. Comparison of the predicted inactivation cross 

section  for  B/r  E.  coli  cells  produced  by  the  present  approach  and  the 

experimental  inactivation  of  B/r  E.  coli  cells  bombarded  by  O  and  Ne  is 

illustrated in Fig. 9. The corresponding fitting parameters for this strain  are 

given  in  Table  3.  Inspecting  Table  3  shows  that  B/r  E.  coli  cells  are  more 

resistant to radiation than the BS-1 E. coli cells. It was found that D0 for B/r 

E. coli is always larger than D0 for BS-1 E. coli cells at a given ion and at a 

given energy.  

Inactivation of B/r E. coli cells by Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Lead and 

gold ions as a function of energy/n are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. General 

satisfactory  agreement  has  been  found  among  the  present  calculations, 

experimental  data  and  Katz  and  Zhang  calculations  especially  at  the  low 

energy  part.  However,  some  deviations  appeared  between  calculated  and 

experimental data at high energy part.

3.4 Action cross section for DSB  

Interaction of radiation with DNA causing double strand break is the 

major  lesions  in  the  genomes,  therefore,  the  action  cross  section  for  DNA 

samples, σDSB  for E. coli cells (BS-1 and B/r) was also calculated using Eq. 

11.  The  beauty  of  the  present  approach  is  its  ability  to  predict  the  action 

cross  section  for  double  strand  break,  σDSB    for  E.  coli  cells  (BS-1  and  B/r) 

DNA using the same fitting parameters (Table 3 and 5) for a given strain or 

cell. The only difference is that DNA needs three hits (m=3) while the cell 

itself is inactivated by two hits only (m=2). DNA samples were bombarded 

with different ions at different energies. The different fitting parameters for 

each  ion  are  compiled  in  Table  5.  It  was  found  that  the  experimental  data 

was well predicted using the target radius, a0=0.2 µm and m=3 and D0 values 

are  different  for  different  ions.  In  this  table,  the  experimental  action  cross 

section for double strand break, σDSB  for E. coli cells (BS-1 and B/r) DNA are 

compared  to  the  calculated  ones.  Global  agreement  between  experimental 

and calculated data was found especially at the low energy ions but at higher 

energy still some disagreement between calculations and experimental data.  

3.5 Ion’s inactivation probability  

The  inactivation  probabilities  for  BS-1  E.  coli,  as  an  example, 

bombarded  with  a  series  of  different  ions  were  studied.  Inactivation 

probability  (Eq.  1)  of  some  charged  particles  of  different  atomic  number 

(Ne,  Ar,  Kr,  Au,  Pb  and  U)  having  similar  energy  per  nucleon  was 

calculated  as  a  function  of  the  radial  distance,  r  normal  to  the  ion  pass. 

Inspecting  Fig.  12,  one  can  observe  that  for  light  ions  i.e.  Neon  can 

inactivate  the  bacteria  ≈100%  if  it  hit  it  within  ≈  1  nm  from  the  ion  path 

14 

 
 
while Argon ion at ≈ 2 nm, Krypton at ≈ 5 nm. Heavy elements like lead and 

U can inactivate the bacteria a 100  % if it hit it within ≈ 15 nm and Au is 

within 20 nm from the ion projectile.   

4. Discussion 

Inactivation  cross  section  of  two  E.  coli  strains  (BS-1  and  B/r)  by 

heavy elements was calculated by integration the inactivation cross section, 

Eq. 11 numerically by the mid-point method. Four parameters are affecting 

the inactivation cross section values i.e. σ (a0 , m, D0 , Rmax). It was found 

that inactivation cross section is slightly depended on the target radius a0 and 

a0 equal 200 nm or 0.2 µm fits the experimental data for all ions. Therefore, 

a0=0.2 µm kept constant for σ and σDSB through-out the present calculations 

for BS-1 and  B/r cells. This target radius is comparable to the radius of the 

cell where E. coli bacterium is about 1–3 µm long and 1 µm width and about 

0.25 µm in diameter. The target radius, a0 equal 0.2 µm is closer to previous 

studies, see Table 3.   

The  number  of  targets  that  must  be  hit  by  radiation  to  cause  an 

observable  effect  (inactivate)  per  cell  was  found  equal  2  (m=2)  by  the 

present  calculation  for  E.  coli  cells  (BS-1  and  B/r).  In  the  meantime,  in 

calculating the action cross section for DNA for the same E. coli (BS-1 and 

B/r) cells, σDSB  it was found that m=3 give the best fit to the experimental 

data.  Therefore,  E.  coli  cells  (BS-1  and B/r)  are  not 1-hit detector  (m=1)  as 

Katz  calculated  (Katz,  1996),  instead  it  is  a  multi-hit  detector  as  expected 

before by Caucinotta et al., 1996 and Katz 1996 for biological systems. This 

implies that two electrons passing through the bacterium  (BS-1 and B/r) and 

15 

 
 
 
three electrons for their DNA are capable of inactivating E. coli cells. E. coli 

cells  are  multi-hit  detector  is  more  reasonable  compared  to  the  notion  that 

it's  one-hit  system  (a  single  electron  passing  through  the  bacterium  is 

capable  of  inactivating  the  cell).  For  biological  cells  m  is  frequently  2  or 

more (Katz et al., 1993 and Katz et al., 1996). The present finding of m=2 is 

more  reasonable  in  this  regard  and  suggest  the  significant  of  the  direct 

interaction  between  the  incoming  ions  and  cells  rather  than  the  indirect 

interaction. 

The  characteristic  dose,  D0  is  significantly  affecting  the  calculated 

inactivation  cross  section;  σ.  Katz  and  co-workers  were  assuming  fixed  a0 

and D0 values but in the present work a0 was fixed at 0.2 µm while D0 was 

varying with different ions.  Table 3 and compiles the D0 values for E. coli 

strains and its DNA for the different bombarded ions.  One can observe that 

D0 increases when the atomic number increases as stated in Tables 3 and 5. 

It  was  found  that the  results  of  the  present  calculations  depend  on  D0  than 

the target radius, a0 in agreement with what was observed by Waligόrski et 

al.,  1987.  Fitting  the  experimental  data,  suggested  the  change  in  D0  gives 

better  prediction  to  the  experimental  data  rather  than  fixing  it  as  previous 

investigator do.   B/r E. coli is more resistant to radiation compared to BS-1 

strain where D0 for it is always large as illustrated in the tables.  

Inspecting the figures as well as the tables, one may observe that the 

calculated inactivation cross section for heavy ions is not 100% in agreement 

with  the  experimental  data.  One  of  the  probable  reasons  for 

this 

disagreement  could  be  the  mean  dose  distribution  over  the  target  radius 

when particle are passing the target area (Schäfer et al., 1994 and Katz et al., 

1996). This assumption is a fundamental one suggested by Katz in his multi-

16 

 
hit  model.    In  comparison  with  experimental  data,  the  inactivation  cross 

section has the difficulty due to determining the real maximum range, Rmax 

travelled  by  δ-rays  (inaccurate  determination  for  Rmax).  Rmax  is  the  upper 

integration  limit  and  it  is  significant  in  both  calculating  the  radial  dose 

(Eq.5) and calculating σ (Eq. 11). Therefore, calculating the maximum δ-ray 

range  by  Eq.  3  and  Eq.  2  give  good  fit  to  the  experimental  data  up  to  10 

MeV/n. But larger than 10-12 MeV/n, there are some disagreement between 

the  experimental  and  the  calculated  data.  Therefore,  the  trial  and  error 

method  was  applied  and  the  suggested  Rmax  that  improved  the  model 

prediction  and  reasonable  agreement  with  experimental data  was  achieved.  

This new Rmax can be accepted in the view that electrons are not moving in 

straight line and it suffers from multiple scattering in its path. One important 

reason  for  this  slightly  disagreement  at  higher  energy  parts  may  be  the 

scattering in the experimental data itself. In addition to this, Takahashi et al., 

1983  in  his  attempt  to  explain  the  disagreement  between  experimental  and 

calculated data (Takahashi et al., 1983) suggested that closer to the ion path 

(10 Å) most atoms or molecules are ionized in such a way that such densely 

excited or ionized species may react with each other and cause thermal spike 

effects.  Such  thermal  effect  may  cause  derangement  of  biological  systems 

and produces boost growing of inactivation cross sections within this narrow 

region  closer  to  the  ion.  Therefore,  the  mean  dose  distribution  over  the 

whole target radius assumption may not exactly hold. 

17 

 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion 

The  present  approach  is  a  promising  one  for  calculating  the 

inactivation  cross  section  for  bacteria  and  viruses  where  good  global 

agreement  between  the  present  calculations  and  the  experimental  data  was 

obtained.  

Inactivation cross section calculation and cell death probability due to 

radiation  is  the  target  of  this  work  and  it  was  found  that  ions  with  higher 

atomic  numbers  produce  larger  inactivation  probability  and  inactivation 

cross section to the E. coli cells (BS-1 and B/r)  and its DNA compared to the 

light ions.  

E.  coli  cells  are  a  multi-hit  detector  where  m=2  for  the  two  E.  coli 

strains and m=3 for its DNA rather than a 1-hit detector. 

Calculating  the  inactivation  cross  section  for  B/r  E.  coli  cells  shows 

that B/r E. coli is more resistant or less sensitive to radiation than the BS-1 E. 

coli  cells  where  the  characteristic  dose  D0  for  B/r  E.  coli  is  always  larger 

than D0 for BS-1 E. coli cells at a given ion.  

Calculated  inactivation  cross  section  is  slightly  depending  on  the 

target radius, a0. In the meantime, it is strongly depend on the chosen Rmax, 

the travelled δ-ray range in the medium.    

The  present  model  predict  inactivation  cross  section  for  lighter  ions 

(O, Ne, Ar and Ke) very well but for heavier ions (Xe, Au, Pb and U) it fit 

the experimental data very well at lower energies (less than 10 MeV/n) but it 

found some difficulties to predict the data at higher energies. The scattering 

in  the  experimental  data  helped  to  increase  this  observation.  It  may  be 

18 

 
attributed to inaccurate Rmax determination and the condensed thermal spike 

region produced by the heavy ions.  

In  progress,  calculating  the  inactivation  cross  section  for  the  more 

complicated  mammalian  cells;  animal  and  culture  cell  using  the  current 

approach.  Estimating  the  relative  biological  effectiveness,  RBE  for  the 

different  ions  as  well  as  using  this  method  for  developing  treatment 

radiotherapy plans for some ions like carbon is under investigations.
