Abstract.
Inter-Coulombic decay (ICD) resonances in the photoionization of
Cl@C60 endofullerene molecule are calculated using a perturbative density functional
theory (DFT) method. This is the ﬁrst ICD study of an open shell atom in a fullerene
cage. Three classes of resonances are probed: (i) Cl inner vacancies decaying through
C60 outer continua, (ii) C60 inner vacancies decaying through Cl outer continua, and
(iii) inner vacancies of either system decaying through the continua of Cl-C60 hybrid
levels, the hybrid Auger-ICD resonances. Comparisons with Ar@C60 results reveal
that the properties of hybrid Auger-ICD resonances are aﬀected by the extent of level
hybridization.

1. Introduction

In loosely bound composite matters, such as polymers, liquids, and biological systems,
the relaxation of an innershell vacancy resulting in the emission of an outershell electron,
both belonging to the same site of the system, is the regular Auger process. But,
this vacancy can also decay by transferring excess energy to a neighboring site. This
migrated energy can subsequently drive the emission of an electron from that site. Such
processes, the inter-Coulombic decay (ICD), are abundant in nature when energetically
allowed, unless quenched by a competing process, and piggyback on the long range
electron-electron Coulomb interactions. Broadly speaking, the excess energy-transfer to
a neighboring site can be triggered via three distinct mechanisms. (i) An outer electron
of the vacancy site can itself ﬁll in the vacancy - the regular ICD [1]. (ii) A weakly bound
electron from the ionizing neighboring site can transfer and ﬁll the vacancy - the electron
transfer mediated decay (ETMD) [2]. (iii) A slow passerby electron can be captured
into the vacancy - the inter-Coulombic electron capture (ICEC) [3]. Experimentally, the
precursor excitation process to create the vacancy can be induced in varieties of ways:
The early work of the observation of ICD in Ne dimers used synchrotron radiation for
this purpose [4]. To achieve a higher pulse rate, for instance to carry out time-resolved
experiment, free electron laser sources are more appropriate [5]. Furthermore, charged
particle impact, such as pulsed electron guns [6] or alpha-particle impact [7] have also
been used. ICD signatures are probed by traditional methods of electron [8] and ion [9]
spectroscopy, including various coincidence techniques [10]. Access to time-resolved ICD
dynamics has also been possible by the contemporary pump-probe approaches [5, 11],
speciﬁcally, by light ﬁeld streaking techniques [12]. A recent comprehensive review of the
experimental and theoretical research of the ICD topic, including the range of materials
studied and potential applications, can be found in Ref. [13].

Probing ICD processes in relatively simpler vapor-phase materials is of considerable
spectroscopic interest [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. One class of such systems of current theoretical
and experimental study is endofullerene complexes,
in which an atomic or a small
molecular host is placed in a fullerene cage. These are unique heterogeneous, nested
dimers of weak host-fullerene bonding. From the experimental side, the synthesis
techniques for these materials are fast-developing [19] with an advantage of their room-
temperature stability. Furthermore, these materials are relevant in a number of applied
contexts [20]. And, note that measurements of a strong ICD signal in a molecular
endofullerene, Ho3N@C80, has recently been reported [21].

If the electron that creates the vacancy subsequently ﬁlls the hole to release energy,
the process is conventionally called the participant ICD. The ﬁrst ab initio calculations
of participant ICD induced resonances in the photoionization of C60 levels induced by
Ar inner 3s [22] and Kr inner 4s [23] vacancy decays, the atom-to-fullerene ICD, were
performed by our group. Later we also studied ICD resonances in the reverse process
of fullerene-to-atom decay [24]. In addition, a remarkable coherence between the Auger
and ICD amplitudes to produce a novel class of resonances in the photoionization of

DFT study of photoionization ICD resonances in Cl@C60

atom-fullerene hybridized states was also predicted [22, 23]. However, these studies
cover only close-shell conﬁned atoms. On the other hand, consideration of open-shell
atomic endofullerenes to access their ICD properties arouses particular interest given
their recent photoresponse studies [25, 26]. In general, due to the existence of unpaired
electrons, there are attractive fundamental interests in such systems. These include long
spin relaxation times in N@C60 [27] while enhancement and diminution in hyperﬁne
coupling, respectively, in P@C60 [28] and exotic muonium@C60 [29].
In this article,
therefore, a prototypical open-shell system of Cl@C60 has been considered for the ﬁrst
time to capture its ICD processes along the photoionization route. A comparison with
the results of Ar@C60, the nearest close-shell system of Cl@C60, exposes the role of
atom-C60 hybridization in the Auger-ICD coherence process.

2. A ﬂeeting description of theory

theory (DFT)

Kohn-Sham density functional
is used to describe the ground,
photoexcited, and photoionized electronic properties of Cl@C60 [25]. The C60 molecule
is modeled by smudging sixty C4+ ions over a classical spherical jellium shell, ﬁxed in
space, with an experimentally known C60 mean radius of 3.5 ˚A and thickness ∆. The
nucleus of a Cl atom is placed at the center of the sphere. The Kohn-Sham equations for
the system of a total of 240 + N electrons (N = 17 for Cl and 240 delocalized electrons
from C60) are then solved to obtain the ground state properties in DFT. The gradient-
corrected Leeuwen and Baerends exchange-correlation (XC) functional [LB94] [30] is
used for the accurate asymptotic behavior of the ground state radial potential

which is solved self-consistently in a mean-ﬁeld framework. The requirement of
charge neutrality produced ∆ = 1.3 ˚A, in agreement with the value inferred from
experiment [31, 32].
Linear-response

is
employed to simulate the dynamical response of C60 to incident photons [33]. The
single-electron dipole operator, z, corresponding to light that is linearly polarized in z-
direction, induces a frequency-dependent complex change in the electron density arising
from dynamical electron correlations. This can be written, using the independent
particle (IP) susceptibility χ0, as

3. Results and discussions

3.1. Cl-to-C60 ICD resonances

Using the well-known approach by Fano [34] to describe the dynamical correlation
through the interchannel coupling, the amplitude of resonant ICD of Cl inner 3s@ photo-
vacancies via C60 @nl ionization can be expressed by M d-c that denotes the coupling of
kl′ continuum channel of
Cl 3s@
C60. Following [22], M d-c can thus be written as:

elements of channels 3s@
ηp@, and E is the photon energy corresponding to the @nl
transition to continuum. In Eq. 6 the ψ are IP wavefunctions that represent the ﬁnal
states (channels) for transitions to excited ηp or continuum kl′ states. Obviously, the
Coulomb coupling matrix element in the numerator of Eq. 6 acts as the passageway for
energy transfer from the Cl de-excitation across to the C60 ionization process, producing
ICD resonances in the C60 @nl cross sections.

Three such Cl-to-C60 ICD resonances, corresponding to Cl 3s@

ηp@ with
η = 4, 5, 6 (labeled as A, B and C), are seen in C60 @7h (HOMO) and C60 @2s
cross sections in Fig. 1. Note that these resonance features in @2s are more prominent
due to relatively smaller values of non-resonant background of the @2s cross section.
Also shown are the corresponding Auger resonances in free Cl 3p cross section from
the decay of the ﬁrst two 3s excitations which show clear Fano window-shape due
to the higher background 3p@ continuum transition strength.
In comparison, the
corresponding ICD resonances show dramatically diﬀerent, small, peak-type shapes,

indicating lower continuum transition strengths, besides the expected energy red-shifts,
owing to the smaller binding energy of conﬁned Cl 3s@. These Cl-to-C60 ICD resonances
are qualitatively similar to those of Ar-to-C60 found earlier [22], albeit with expected
energy oﬀsets. The remaining resonances in @7h and @2s cross sections in Fig. 1 are
from Auger decays of C60 inner holes and are almost stable in their energies as can be
seen by comparing with the empty C60 total cross section (shown).

3.2. C60-to-Cl ICD resonances

A coupled-channel representation of the matrix element like Eq. 6, but to address the
kp
ICD resonances from the decay of C60 inner excitations that appear in the Cl 3s@
photoionization of Cl@C60, can be written as,

Since a number of inner C60 vacancies can be produced that are degenerate with Cl 3s@
ionization, two sums have been introduced.

C60-to-Cl ICD resonances are displayed in Fig. 2 for 3s@ photoionization of Cl.
Note that the cross section is highly structured with the resonances when compared
to the smooth 3s cross section of free Cl (shown). As seen, the free Cl result in the
current energy range does not include any regular Auger decay of atomic innershell
vacancies, indicating that the ICD process completely dominates the vacancy decay.

Figure 2. (Color online) Cross sections of free Cl 3s subshell and 3s@ of Cl@C60 are
compared. The total cross section of empty C60 is also presented.

The resonances are strong and of varied shapes. Their narrow width owes to the C60
excitations. Indeed, C60 wavefunctions, atypical of cluster properties, are delocalized,
spreading over a large volume (see Fig. 3). Since the autionization rate involves the
matrix element of 1/r12 [Eq. 7], spread-out wavefunctions translate to a decrease in the
value of the matrix elements.

→

Fig. 2 also shows that for Cl 3s@ the Cooper minimum, seen in the non-resonant
background values of the curve, moves lower in energy to about 32 eV from its positions
of 35 eV in free Cl. This shift is a consequence of the atom-C60 dynamical coupling
of Cl ns@
kp ionization channel with a host of C60 continuum channels and was
earlier noted for conﬁned Ar and Kr as well [24]. This coupling is included in M c-c in
Eq. 5. A comparison with the resonances (Auger) in the empty C60 cross section (shown)
indicates a general energy correspondence between Auger and ICD features, although
there appear a rather dramatic shape alterations, in particular, at higher energies. The
overall behavior of the ICD resonances is found very similar to the previous results for
Ar 3s@ and Kr 4s@ caged in C60.

3.3. Hybrid Auger-ICD resonances

About an equal share of mixing in ground state hybridization between valence 3p orbital
for Ar with C60 3p was earlier found in Ar@C60 [22]. In fact, the hybridization gap of
C60) hybrid levels in that earlier calculation was
1.52 eV between (Ar+C60) and (Ar
in good agreement with the measured value of 1.6
0.2 eV [35]. This hybridization in
Cl@C60 forming the symmetric and antisymmetric mixing similar to the bonding and
antibonding states in molecules or dimers can be given as,

The inner (Ri) and outer (Ro) radii of the C60 shell are shown on panel (a).

A comparison in Fig. 3 clearly shows somewhat weakened hybridization in Cl@C60 versus
Ar@C60 which is primarily due to higher Cl 3p binding energy leading to a larger energy
gap between this level with C60 3p. Both free and hybrid radial wavefunctions and
corresponding energies are shown in Fig. 3 for a comparison between Cl@C60 and Ar@C60
ground state properties.

through the Cl continuum, like in the Auger decay, and the second term will embody
the decay through the C60 continuum, like the ICD. This will result in resonant hybrid
Auger-ICD (RHA-ICD) features from coherence in a outer hybrid level cross section
driven by a Cl hole. These resonances for both hybrid levels of Cl@C60 are presented in
the top panel of of Fig. 4 and labeled as A, B and C for three 3s@
np@ excitations. On
the other hand, the original vacancy at C60 in Eq. 10 will produce coherent RHA-ICD
features initiated by a C60 hole. All remaining resonances in Fig. 4 (top) for hybrid states
are from this latter category. We note in Fig. 4 (top) that the resonances A-C in both
C60 3p cross sections feature window-type shapes, like the free Cl Auger resonances
Cl
(shown), generally suggesting strong continuum transitions. These RHA-ICD window
resonances may likely be observed in the experiment due to their broad widths. However,
we further note that these resonance shapes are signiﬁcantly stronger for the symmetric
Cl+C60 level. The generic shapes of RHA-ICD structures from C60 hole-decays, on the
other hand, are seen to be non-window type, while they are substantially more prominent
C60 emission. The cause of these disparities is discussed below.

The novel RHA-ICD features were originally predicted for Ar@C60 [22] that are also
presented in Fig. 4 (bottom) to draw insights from comparisons. As seen for Ar@C60,
for each hybrid level cross section these resonances initiated by creation of Ar inner
3s holes (A-C) versus by creation of C60 inner holes (1-4) are of approximately similar
strengths. This is a direct consequence of a similar degree of mixing between Ar and
C60 levels (see Fig. 3) – a fact that generates similar magnitudes of
C60 characters in Ar
overlaps in the Coulomb coupling matrix elements in Eq. 10. However, as noted before,
the mixing reduces in Cl@C60. As seen in Fig. 3, while the Cl+C60 level contains more
C60 has more C60 character. This fact, through the coupling matrix
Cl character, Cl
elements in Eq. 10, translates into stronger RHA-ICD structures, A-C, for the decay of
Cl holes in Cl+C60 than in Cl
C60. Likewise, this same fact is also responsible for the
opposite behavior for C60 hole decay, that is, the corresponding stronger structures in
Cl

C60 versus in Cl+C60.

3.4. ETMD admixture

In an endofullerene system the excited state for the precursor excitation resulting in
an Auger decay or an ICD can itself be a state which is a hybrid of an atomic and
a C60 excited state of same angular momentum character. Here the excited states in
question include ηp@, @ηλ and ηλ in, respectively, Eq. 6, 7 and 10. This suggests that
the part of the excited probability that will transfer to the other system can fall back
in to the vacancy to initiate a resonant Auger decay or an ICD or a hybridized Auger-
ICD. Furthermore, a very careful comparison between the ICD related results with
corresponding empty C60 results in Figs. (2) and (4) reveals a very few extra resonances
in the ICD curves. These are present owing to the additional excited states in the
spectrum of the whole compound, since it now also includes the empty states of the

some of the resonances of both ICD and Auger nature presented here may incorporate
coherent mixing with ETMD amplitudes. Of course, these contributions are hard to
separate. A detailed discussion about such coherent combination of resonant ICD and
ETMD mechanisms, but for a speciﬁc case of C60-to-Ar ICD, was given elsewhere [24].

4. Conclusion

We present results of various kinds of single-electron ICD-type resonances in the
photoemission of the Cl@C60 molecule. This is the ﬁrst ICD study of an endofullerene
with a one-vacancy, open-shell atom inside. The calculation is carried out in a jellium-
based linear-response time-dependent density functional framework that has previous
success. The study includes resonant decays of Cl (C60) innershell excitation vacancies
degenerate with C60 (Cl) outershell ionization vacancies. A uniquely diﬀerent class of
resonant features decaying into atom-fullerene hybrid ﬁnal state vacancies has also been
presented which arises from the interference of the Auger channel with an intrinsically
connected ICD channel. These resonances are found to be remarkably strong, and
the ones initiated by atomic excitations are quite broad. Hence they are likely
experimentally measurable, allowing a powerful access to ICD dynamics. Furthermore,
the hybridized character of some of the excited states of the compound points to a
coherence of ICD with the ETMD process. Such ICD-ETMD coherences should be
abundant – all it would require is that both the fullerene and the trapped atom or
molecule have dipole-allowed excited states of the same (angular momentum) symmetry
so they can hybridize. Some of these resonances may also be amenable to being probed
experimentally. Although the present calculation only includes participant RICDs,
where the precursor hole is ﬁlled by the excited electron itself, it is of great interest to
access the inﬂuence of spectator processes; these could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the situation
and certainly need study. Based upon our explanation of the details of multicenter
decay, the resonant ICD predicted here is expected to be a strong process in general for
any atom or molecule encaged in any fullerene, in any position, central or not.

With the contemporary focus [36] on photoemission phase and time delay studies
by interferometric metrology [37], particularly at Fano window resonances for Ar [38],
we hope that the current results will stimulate similar ultrafast spectroscopic studies of
ICD resonances. And to that end, our future research outlook includes investigations
of Wigner type intrinsic time delays of these various resonant ICD emissions.
