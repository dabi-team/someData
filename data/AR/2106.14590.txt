The quasielastic production cross sections and polarizations of the hyperons induced by ¯νµ on
the free nucleon as well as from 40Ar in the sub-GeV energy region has been reviewed [1–5]. The
eﬀects of the second class currents in the axial vector sector with and without T-invariance as well
as the eﬀect of SU(3) symmetry breaking are also studied. We ﬁnd that the cross sections and
the various polarization components can eﬀectively be used to determine the axial vector transition
form factors in the strangeness sector and to test the validity of various symmetries of the weak
hadronic currents like G-invariance, T-invariance and SU(3) symmetry.
These hyperons decay dominantly into pions giving an additional contribution to the weak pion
production induced by the antineutrinos. In the case of nuclear targets like 40Ar, this contribution
is shown to be signiﬁcant when compared with the the pion production by the ∆ excitations in the
energy range of E¯νµ ≤ 0.7 GeV [1]. This study could be useful for the DUNE experiment where
argon will be used as the target material and the electronic imaging of particles is possible and the
particle tracks can be identiﬁed.

INTRODUCTION

The goal of the present day experimenters using accelerator neutrino and antineutrino beams at the ongoing
experiments like T2K, NOvA, etc., or the planned experiments like DUNE at the Fermilab [6], T2HK in J-PARC [7],
is to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters with greater precision, and to search for the CP violation in the
leptonic sector.

For this, the simultaneous knowledge of neutrino and antineutrino cross sections in the same energy region for
a given nuclear target is required. Almost all the current generation neutrino experiments are using moderate to
heavy nuclear targets, where the (anti)neutrino-nucleus cross section gets modiﬁed due to the nuclear medium eﬀects.
In the few GeV energy region of neutrinos and antineutrinos, the contribution to the total scattering cross section
comes from the quasielastic, inelastic and deep inelastic scattering of (anti)neutrinos with the nuclear targets. In
this energy region, the inelastic channel is dominated by the single pion production, followed by the kaon production,
associated particle production, multi-pion production, etc. In the case of antineutrinos, apart from the aforementioned
processes, the quasielastic hyperon (Λ, Σ0 and Σ−) production also contributes to the total scattering cross section.
The produced hyperons then decay into a nucleon and a pion, thus, giving additional contribution to the single
pion production. This mode of pion production is important in the low energy region, even though, the dominant
contribution to the single pion production comes from the ∆ excitations. We have estimated that in the low energy
region of E¯νµ ≤
0.7 GeV, the pions arising from the hyperon decays are comparable to the pions arising from the ∆
excitations [1]. This is because the pion production arising from the ∆ excitations is considerably suppressed due to
the nuclear medium eﬀects (NME) and the ﬁnal state interaction (FSI) eﬀects as the ∆ properties like its mass and
decay width are modiﬁed in the nuclear medium. Furthermore, these deltas decay instantly to pions, which travel
through the nucleus and undergo ﬁnal state interactions with the residual nucleus resulting in pion absorption or
charge exchange reactions. On the other hand, the nuclear medium eﬀects on the hyperon production cross sections
are quite small. Moreover, the ﬁnal state interactions of the produced hyperons, due to the strong interactions, in the
presence of the nucleons in the nuclear medium leading to elastic and charge exchange reactions like ΣN
ΛN and
ΣN aﬀects only the relative yield of various hyperons (Λ and Σ). The total number of pions produced through
ΛN
the diﬀerent Y
Y N ﬁnal state interaction eﬀects. In
addition, these pions are expected to be less aﬀected by the ﬁnal state interaction with the residual nucleus. This
is because the hyperon decay widths are highly suppressed in the nuclear medium making them live longer enabling
them to travel through most of the nuclear medium before they decay. Therefore, the cumulative eﬀects of the lower
threshold energy for the hyperon production compared to the delta production, and the near absence of the FSI for
the pions coming from the hyperon decay compensate for the Cabibbo suppression as compared to the pions coming
from the ∆ excitations. This makes the study of hyperon production processes important in the context of oscillation
experiments with antineutrinos in the sub-GeV energy region.

N π decay modes is, therefore, least aﬀected by the Y N

The study of single hyperon production is important in its own right as it provides information about the nucleon-
hyperon transition form factors at high Q2, which is presently known only at low Q2 from the study of the semileptonic
decays of neutron and hyperons. The symmetries of the weak hadronic current like the T-invariance, G-invariance
and SU(3) symmetry can also be tested, and some information on the physics beyond the standard model may also
be obtained.
In the past, various calculations on the charged current induced (anti)neutrino and electron scattering
from the free nucleon and nuclear targets, have been done by many authors in which both the production cross
sections as well as the polarization observables of muons and baryons were studied [3–5, 8–16]. With the advancement
in the detection technology and the observation of the τ neutrino (ντ ) experimentally, some calculations for the
polarization observables of the τ leptons produced in the ντ (¯ντ ) induced reactions have also been performed in the
weak processes [12, 17–22]. Recently, Thorpe et al. [23] have also studied the eﬀect of second class currents, axial
dipole mass and SU(3) symmetry violation on the total and diﬀerential scattering cross sections in the antineutrino
induced single hyperon production. We have also studied the dependence of diﬀerent vector and axial vector current
form factors including the second class current form factors on the total and diﬀerential cross section and have tested
the degree of time reversal and G-parity violations in the antineutrino as well as electron induced single hyperon
production [1–5, 17]. In this work, we have extended our model [2, 4] for the production cross section and polarization
observables of the hyperons produced in the antineutrino and electron induced reactions by taking into account the
eﬀect of SU(3) symmetry breaking, following the formalism of Faessler et al. [24] in the determination of the vector
and axial vector form factors in the strangeness sector.

We have studied the polarization components of the hyperons produced in the antineutrino induced reactions and the
eﬀect of the various weak form factors on these polarization observables. The longitudinal (PL) and perpendicular (PP )
components of polarization lie in the plane while the transverse (PT ) component of polarization lies perpendicular
to the reaction plane and is forbidden by T-invariance. The experimental measurement of the non-zero value of
the transverse component of the polarized hyperon will directly show the violation of time reversal in the weak
sector. Recently developed liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) technology which is being used in the
MicroBooNE and ICARUS experiments at the Fermilab and planned to be used in the proposed DUNE (The Deep
Underground Neutrino Experiment) experiment [25, 26], with an expected ﬁducial mass of about 40kT, holds very
high promises as LArTPC provide excellent tracking and calorimetry, real time full imaging of events where the
detectors would be capable of identifying and measuring precisely the neutrino events over a wide range of energies.
It would be possible to study the hyperon (Λ, Σ) production and its polarization by observing the asymmetry in the
angular distribution of the pions when the hyperons decay into N π, as LArTPC gives the 3-dimensional track of
the interaction. Therefore, it is feasible to study the physics of T-violation in the leptonic sector by measuring the
polarization components of the hyperons produced in the antineutrino reactions [1, 2, 17].

In this work, we have focused our attention especially on the Λ production in the antineutrino–nucleon/nucleus
reactions, which is the most feasible channel to study experimentally. In section-II, we describe, in brief, the formalism
for calculating the cross sections for the single hyperon production and the delta production from the free nucleon
target. The expression for the polarization components viz., PL, PP and PT of the hyperon produced in the quasielastic
reactions, are given in section-II B. Section III deals with the eﬀect of the nuclear medium on the ∆ and the hyperon
productions, and the ﬁnal state interactions of the hyperons in the nuclear medium. The ﬁnal state interactions
of the produced pions are discussed in section-IV. In section-V, we present our results and ﬁnally in section-VI, we
summarize and conclude the ﬁndings.

If the T-invariance is assumed then all the vector and the axial vector form factors are real and the expression for
C(Q2) vanishes which implies that the transverse component of polarization, PT (Q2) perpendicular to the production
plane, vanishes.

III. NUCLEAR MEDIUM EFFECTS

A. Hyperons produced inside the nucleus

When the antineutrino induced hyperon production takes place on the nucleons which are bound in the nucleus,
Fermi motion and Pauli blocking eﬀects of initial nucleons are considered. In the present work, the Fermi motion

B. Delta produced inside the nucleus

When an antineutrino interacts with a nucleon (Eq.26) inside a nuclear target, nuclear medium eﬀects like Fermi
motion, Pauli blocking, etc., come into play. The produced ∆s have no such constraints in the production channel but
their decay is inhibited by the Pauli blocking of the ﬁnal nucleons. Also, there are other disappearance channels open
for ∆s through particle hole excitations and this leads to the modiﬁcation in the mass and width of the propagator
deﬁned in Eq.(35).

6
To take into account the nuclear medium eﬀects, we have evaluated the cross section using the local density
approximation, following the same procedure as mentioned in section-III A, and the diﬀerential scattering cross section
for the reactions given in Eqs. (26) and (27) is deﬁned as :

The hyperons decay to a pion and a nucleon viz., Λ

nπ−. However, when
the hyperons are produced in a nuclear medium, some of them disappear through the hyperon-nucleon interaction
processes like Y N
N N , though it is suppressed due to the nuclear eﬀects [40, 41]. Moreover, the pionic decay
modes of hyperons are Pauli blocked as the momentum of the nucleons available in these decays is considerably below
the Fermi level of energy for most nuclei leading to a long lifetime for the hyperons in the nuclear medium [40, 41].
N N transition in the medium live long enough to travel the
Therefore, the hyperons which survive the Y N
nuclear medium and decay outside the nucleus. In view of this, we have assumed no ﬁnal state interaction of the
produced pions with the nucleons inside the nuclear medium. In a realistic situation, all the hyperons produced in
these reactions will not survive in the nucleus, and the pions coming from the decay of hyperons will undergo FSI [39].
A quantitative analysis of the hyperon disappearance through the Y N
N N interaction and the pions having FSI
eﬀect, will require a dynamic nuclear model to estimate the nonmesonic and mesonic decays of the hyperons in a
nucleus which is beyond the scope of the present work. Our results in the following section, therefore, represent an
upper limit on the production of pions arising due to the production of hyperons.

B. Delta production

The pions produced in the ∆ excitation processes inside the nucleus may re-scatter or may produce more pions or
may get absorbed while coming out from the ﬁnal nucleus. We have taken the results of Vicente Vacas et al. [42] for
the ﬁnal state interaction of pions which is calculated in an eikonal approximation using probabilities per unit length
as the basic input. The details are given Ref. [42].

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Total scattering cross sections

In Fig. 2, the results for the total scattering cross sections σ(E¯νµ ) vs E¯νµ are presented for ¯νµ scattering oﬀ 40Ar
nuclear target, for the π−(Left panel) and πo(Right panel) productions, respectively. These results are shown for
the cross sections obtained without and with nuclear medium and ﬁnal state interaction (NME+FSI) eﬀects for the
pion production arising due to the ∆ excitation and the Λ production. Note the diﬀerent scales used in Fig. 2 for
displaying the results for π− and π0 production cross sections as explained in the respective ﬁgure captions. We have
earlier discussed in some detail, the nuclear medium and ﬁnal state interaction eﬀects on the production of ∆ and
hyperon (Λ+Σ) in nuclei as well as the eﬀect of nuclear absorption and charge exchange scattering of π0 and π− in the
nuclear medium [1, 43]. We show, in Fig. 2, the numerical results for 40Ar nucleus relevant in the low energy region

FIG. 2: Results for π−

presented for the pion production from the ∆ and Λ with and without NME+FSI. Notice that in the case of π−
production, the
results of ∆ without NME+FSI are suppressed by a factor of 6 and the results for ∆ with NME+FSI are suppressed by a factor
of 3 to bring them on the same scale while in the case of π0 production, the results of ∆ without NME+FSI are suppressed by
a factor of 3, and there is no scale factor when NME+FSI eﬀects are included.

inclusion of the FSI eﬀect, there is a small enhancement at lower energies, which increases to
However, in the presence of NME and FSI eﬀects, the π− production from ∆ decays dominates for E¯νµ > 0.7 GeV,
below which π− from Λ decays is quite comparable to the π− from ∆ decays. Similarly, in the case of π0 from the Λ
decays, the NME+FSI increases the production cross section by about 40% at E¯νµ = 1 GeV, and this enhancement
increases with the increase in antineutrino energy. Moreover, it may be noticed from the ﬁgure that the π0 production
from Λ decays is comparable to π0 from ∆ excitations in the region from threshold up to E¯νµ ≤
0.75 GeV, while at
E¯νµ < 0.75 GeV, π0 from the ∆ decays dominates. It should be noted that the enhancement due to nuclear medium
of π− and π0 yield from the hyperon (Λ + Σ) decays is mainly due to Y N
Y N ﬁnal state interactions in which the
Σ hyperons get converted to Λ hyperons.

To quantify the hyperon production cross sections and to compare the pions arising due to hyperons with the pions
arising due to delta, in Fig. 3, we have obtained the results for the ratio of delta to hyperon production cross sections,

It may be observed from these curves that in the case of π− production, at low energies, say around E¯νµ ∼

0.5 GeV,
the ratio Rπ− is approximately unity which implies that the number of π− coming from the hyperons is almost
comparable to the number of π− coming from ∆. However, with the increase in E¯νµ , π− coming from ∆ starts

production, as observed from Fig. 3, the ratio Rπ0 is less than one almost up to E¯νµ ≤
0.8 GeV, which means that
the π0 arising from the hyperons has a larger contribution than the π0 coming from ∆, in the low energy region.
However, with the increase in E¯νµ , the π0 contribution from ∆ starts dominating.

class current form factor g2(Q2) with or without T invariance increases the value of the cross section both for the free
nucleon as well as for the argon nucleus. It may be observed from Fig. 7 that the eﬀect of SU(3) symmetry breaking
in the absence of the second class curent is to decrease the total cross section for the free nucleon as well as for the
argon nucleus. Therefore, the two eﬀects tend to cancel one another. In the case of the free nucleon, we observe that
the results obtained with SU(3) symmetry breaking eﬀect and gR

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this review, we have studied the antineutrino induced quasielastic production of hyperons and their polarization
components from the free nucleon as well as from the argon nucleus. These results may be useful in determining the
axial vector transition form factors in the strangeness sector specially the form factor corresponding to the second
class currents with and without T-invariance. We have also studied the eﬀect of SU(3) symmetry breaking on the
cross section for hyperon production.

We summarize our results in the following:

i) In the low energy region of antineutrinos, i.e., E¯νµ < 0.7 GeV, the pions produced by the decay of hyeprons (Λ +
Σ) is comparable to the production of pions from the ∆ decays. This is because the weak production of ∆ in this
energy region is inhibited by the threshold eﬀect and is reduced by the nuclear medium eﬀects. Moreover, the
pions produced by the ∆ decays undergo absorption and other ﬁnal state interaction eﬀects in the nuclear medium
leading to a substantial reduction in the pion yield. These eﬀects compensate for the Cabibbo suppression of
the hyperon production as well as the reduction due to the nuclear medium and ﬁnal state interactions in the
case of the pions produced by the hyperon decays.

ii) The total cross sections for the single hyperon production both from the free nucleon and from the argon nucleus
are quite sensitive to the variation in the G violating axial vector form factor associated with the second class
currents.

 
 
 
iii) The non-zero value of the second class current form factor with and without T invariance may lead to a smaller
value of the axial dipole mass in the case of νµ(¯νµ) induced ∆S = 0 and ∆S = 1 quasielastic reactions from free
as well as bound nucleons.

iv) The presence of the second class current form factor with or without T invariance increases the total cross
section with increase in E¯νµ , while the inclusion of the eﬀect of the SU(3) symmetry breaking, in the case of
Λ production, decreases the cross section with the increase in E¯νµ , tending towards a cancellation due to these
eﬀects.
