Abstract

Proportional electroluminescence (EL) in noble gases has long been used in two-phase detectors for dark matter search, to record
ionization signals induced by particle scattering in the noble-gas liquid (S2 signals). Until recently, it was believed that proportional
electroluminescence was fully due to VUV emission of noble gas excimers produced in atomic collisions with excited atoms, the
latter being in turn produced by drifting electrons. In this work we consider an additional mechanism of proportional electrolu-
minescence, namely that of bremsstrahlung of drifting electrons scattered on neutral atoms (so-called neutral bremsstrahlung); it
is systemically studied here both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, the absolute EL yield has for the ﬁrst time been
measured in pure gaseous argon in the two-phase mode, using a dedicated two-phase detector with EL gap optically read out by
cryogenic PMTs and SiPMs. We show that the neutral bremsstrahlung eﬀect can explain two intriguing observations in EL ra-
diation: that of the substantial contribution of the non-VUV spectral component, extending from the UV to NIR, and that of the
photon emission at lower electric ﬁelds, below the Ar excitation threshold. Possible applications of neutral bremsstrahlung eﬀect
in two-phase dark matter detectors are discussed.

1. Introduction

Proportional electroluminescence (EL) in noble gases (or dif-
ferently secondary scintillation) is the eﬀect that is routinely
used in two-phase (liquid-gas) detectors to record ionization
signals in the gas phase, induced by particle scattering in the
liquid phase (so-called S2 signals) [1, 2, 3, 4]. Such two-phase
detectors are relevant for dark matter search [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and
low energy neutrino detection [10, 11, 12]. The S2 signals
are recorded typically in the EL gap placed above the liquid-
gas interface, optically read out using either cryogenic PMTs
[5, 6, 7, 8] or cryogenic SiPMs [9].

Until recently,

it was commonly believed that propor-
tional electroluminescence was fully due to vacuum ultraviolet
(VUV) emission of noble gas excimers, e.g. Ar∗
u ), pro-
duced in three-body atomic collisions with excited atoms, e.g.
Ar∗(3p54s1), which in turn are produced by drifting electrons
in electron-atom collisions: see review [13].

While proportional electroluminescence in heavy noble
gases (Ar, Kr and Xe) was thoroughly studied at room tem-
perature, both theoretically and experimentally [14, 15], little
was known about that at cryogenic temperatures. The study
of proportional electroluminescence in gaseous Ar at cryogenic
temperatures, in the two-phase mode, has been recently started
by our (Novosibirsk) group [16, 17, 18]. The ﬁrst results were
obtained in argon with a minor (10-50 ppm) admixture of nitro-

gen. The idea to use the N2 dopant was to shift the VUV emis-
sion of Ar to the near ultraviolet (UV) emission of N2 directly
in the detection medium, in order to avoid using a wavelength
shifter (WLS) in front of PMTs or SiPMs. It relied on the fact
that in the presence of N2, the excimer production (and hence
the VUV emission) can be taken over by that of excited N2
molecules (due to excitation transfer from Ar to N2 species),
followed by their de-excitations in the near UV through the
emission of the so-called Second Positive System (2PS), at 310-
430 nm [13, 19].

However, the results obtained in [16, 18] have been mixed.
On one hand, the presence of the non-VUV component (i.e. that
of UV and visible) was conﬁrmed in proportional electrolumi-
nescence in two-phase Ar doped with N2. On the other hand,
at such small N2 contents (10-50 ppm) the appearance of the
non-VUV component could not be explained in a simple model
of excitation transfer from Ar to N2 [13]. Hence, the problem
of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar remained
unresolved.

In this work, we partially resolved the problem: we have
studied proportional electroluminescence in pure gaseous Ar,
without additives, in the two-phase mode. Surprisingly, we
again observed a non-VUV component in EL radiation. More-
over, this component was observed not only at higher electric
ﬁelds, but also at lower ﬁelds, below the Ar excitation thresh-
old. These unexpected observations made us recall the idea of
an additional EL mechanism in two-phase Ar, namely that of
neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS), that acts concurrently with the
ordinary mechanism.

Bremsstrahlung of drifting electrons scattered on neutral
atoms (so-called neutral bremsstrahlung) is produced by slow
electrons, at the energies of the order of 1-10 eV [20, 21, 22,
23, 24]. The NBrS eﬀect was used to explain continuous emis-
sion spectra in a weakly ionized plasma [25, 26, 27]. The
NBrS eﬀect was also used to develop a detection technique
for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, where the NBrS radiation (in
the radio-frequency range) is emitted by low-energy ionization
electrons left after the passage of the showers in the atmosphere
[28].

More interesting is that back in 1970, the NBrS mechanism
was proposed as an explanation for proportional electrolumi-
nescence in xenon [29]. In subsequent work [30], the photon
emission rate was theoretically calculated for NBrS electrolu-
minescence; it was stated there that in Xe the EL rate agrees,
in order of magnitude, with the calculated NBrS rate of light
production.

However this statement was refuted in [31]. Here is a quote
from that work: ”The agreement of our results with previous
experimental work shows that mechanisms based on the direct
excitation of the noble gas atoms by the electrons can fully
account for the secondary light production. There is no need
to consider other processes like ... neutral bremsstrahlung”.
Since then bremsstrahlung in connection with electrolumines-

a hypothesis explaining the weak under-threshold electrolumi-
nescence observed in gaseous krypton [32], with reference to
the unpublished work [33].

In the present work we show that at least for Ar the NBrS
mechanism is needed to explain the properties of proportional
electroluminescence: we developed the theory of NBrS electro-
luminescence that for the ﬁrst time quantitatively described the
experiment at lower ﬁelds, below the excitation threshold, and
that has chances to do it at higher ﬁelds, above the threshold.
Accordingly, this work might be considered as a revival of the
idea of NBrS electroluminescence.

The present study was performed in the course of the devel-
opment of two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detectors (CRADs)
of ultimate sensitivity for rare-event experiments [34, 35, 36,
37].

Bremsstrahlung

(ordinary

bremsstrahlung or OBrS) may be considered as the most
famous electromagnetic process involving electrons and pho-
tons. There are two other less known electron bremsstrahlung
processes: that of polarization bremsstrahlung (PBrS) and that
of neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS). These are schematically
depicted in Figs. 1 and 2.

Polarization bremsstrahlung is produced by atoms due to
their time-dependent polarization, induced by fast electrons
when scattered on atoms: see Fig. 1 and review [38]. At elec-
tron energies of the order of 1 keV, its intensity is predicted to
be comparable with that of ordinary bremsstrahlung.

Neutral bremsstrahlung is produced by slow electrons when
they are scattered (elastically or inelastically) on neutral atoms
(Fig. 2):

e− + A → e− + A + hν ,
e− + A → e− + A∗ + hν .

We will see in the following that NBrS spectrum lies in the UV,
visible and near infrared (NIR) regions and that its intensity is
maximal for elastic collisions (reaction 1), at electron energies
of the order of 1-10 eV. At such energies the contribution of or-
dinary and polarization bremsstrahlung can be neglected, since
the OBrS emission is suppressed due screening of the Coulomb
ﬁeld of the atomic nucleus, and since the PBrS intensity was
shown to be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of NBrS
[21].

In the general case, the electron-atom scattering producing
a NBrS photon may be accompanied by excitation of an atom
(reaction 2). For this case, the analytical formula for diﬀerential
cross section of NBrS photon emission was given in [24] (in the
approximation of an even partial wave):

For elastic electron-atom scattering Eexc = 0 and the dif-

where the NBrS cross section is expressed via electron elastic
cross section (σel(E)). The two terms in the brackets reﬂect
two ways to emit a bremsstrahlung photon, namely after and
before a collision. The equation is obtained in the ﬁrst Born
approximation and when one of the partial waves predominates
over the others, resulting in that the contribution of interference
term is small [21, 24].

It should be remarked that there are two opinions about what
elastic cross section should appear in the formula: that of inte-
gral elastic [20, 21, 23, 24] or momentum transfer (transport)
[22, 23, 27]. In what follows, we use the integral elastic cross
section in Eq. 4.

For inelastic collisions the equations are the same, except that

changed to hν + Eexc.

Proportional electroluminescence is characterized by a ”re-
duced EL yield” (YEL/N), which by deﬁnition is the number
of photons produced per drifting electron per atomic density
and per unit drift path. Accordingly, the NBrS contribution to
proportional electroluminescence can be described by the fol-

The EL yield in this approach is rather sensitive to the elec-

distribution function, we applied a similar approach to the ordi-
nary EL mechanism, involving excimers [3, 13, 15]:

where σexc(E) is the inelastic cross section to produce an argon
excited state in electron-atom collisions. Similarly to [15], it is
assumed here that one excited state (Ar∗) produces one excimer
state (Ar∗
2) and that one excimer produces one VUV photon
(around 128 nm). Here ordinary electroluminescence is used
as a benchmark: if its EL yield calculated this way is consis-
tent with the theoretical and experimental data given elsewhere
[15], then the distribution function can be considered valid.

3. Cross sections, electron energy distribution functions,

NBrS spectra and EL yields

The electron energy distribution functions were calculated by
solving the Boltzmann equation using BOLSIG+ free software
[39, 40], based on electron scattering cross sections from Mag-
boltz [41, 42]. Fig. 3 presents the cross sections used in the
present work, namely that of elastic, momentum-transfer, ex-
citation and ionization. The excitation cross section was taken
as the sum of those for >40 low-lying argon excitation states,
the major contribution being provided by the 4 lowest states of
Ar∗(3p54s1) conﬁguration.

Fig. 4 shows the total cross section measured in [43] around
Feshbach resonances [44], at 11.10 eV and 11.28 eV, i.e.

Figure 3: Electron scattering cross sections in argon used in the present work,
obtained from the last version of Magboltz 8.97 [42]: elastic (σel), momentum-
transfer (σtrans), excitation (σexc) and ionization (σion). The excitation cross
section was taken as the sum of those for >40 low-lying argon excitation state.

slightly below the Ar excitation threshold (11.55 eV). The res-
onance width is Γ=2-3 meV [43]. Such sub-excitation reso-
nances appear in electron-atom scattering when the electron and
the atom form the negative ion bound state:

e− + Ar → Ar−(3p54s2) → e− + Ar .

(12)

The cross-section enhancement around the resonances can
hardly directly aﬀect the EL yield, since its contribution to the
integral in Eq. 8 is not that large. However it was noted that the
resonances may have an indirect eﬀect: at the resonance ener-
gies the electron energy distribution function might be modiﬁed
[30, 45] and the NBrS intensity might be enhanced [46, 47].
The latter issue will be discussed further at the end of the sec-
tion.

f (cid:48) is considered to be more enlightening than f since in the
limit of zero electric ﬁeld it tends to Maxwellian distribution.

sions at 8.3 Td is shown.

Figs. 8 and 9 show the NBrS spectra of the photon energy
intensity and reduced EL yield. The spectra were calculated
by numerical integration in Eq. 6 and Eq. 9. One can see that
the spectra are rather ﬂat, extending from the UV to visible and
NIR regions. The spectra looks very similar to those calculated

for NBrS in glow discharge [26], that speaks in favor of cor-
rectness of calculations. In addition, a NBrS spectrum for in-
elastic collisions at the highest electric ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 8,
to demonstrate that its contribution is considerably (6 orders of
magnitude) smaller compared to that of elastic collisions. That
is why in what follows we neglect the NBrS contribution due to
inelastic collisions.

It should be remarked that the approach based on the solution
of the Boltzmann equation is rather approximate, resulting in
that Figs.8 and 9 give only a rough idea of the NBrS spectra. In-
deed, the distribution function and other quantities in Figs. 5,6

ally averaged over the collisions and hence also over the time
between the collisions. In fact, the energy in equations 5,6,8
and 9 should be the energy just before the collisions, which ob-
viously exceeds the time-averaged energy since the electrons
are accelerated by the ﬁeld between the collisions. This diﬀer-
ence is illustrated in Figs. 7 where the average electron energy,
obtained solving Boltzmann equation, is compared to the mean
energy before collisions, obtained in [15] by simulation of elec-
tron transport in an electric ﬁeld using microscopic approach.

rected for mean energy before collisions (corrected distribution functions). For
comparison, the EL yield calculated using microscopic approach from Oliveira
et al. [15] is shown.

We tried to estimate the eﬀect of this diﬀerence on the EL
yields: the distribution functions were corrected by multiply-
ing those by a power function so that the average energies for
the corrected distributions coincide with the mean energies be-
fore collisions taken from [15]. An example of this correction
procedure is shown in Fig. 10.

Figs. 11 and 12 show the integral NBrS photon energy in-
tensity (Ien) and reduced EL yield (YEL/N) as a function of the
reduced electric ﬁeld, integrated over two diﬀerent wavelength
regions: that of 0-1000 nm and 0-10000 nm. In addition, Fig. 13
compares the ordinary EL yield, calculated using Eq. 11, to that
of neutral bremsstrahlung, calculated using Eq. 8. One can see
that ordinary electroluminescence has a characteristic ﬁeld de-
pendence: it starts at some threshold electric ﬁeld, of about of
4.0 Td, corresponding to the commencement of atomic excita-
tions, and then linearly increases with the ﬁeld.

The NBrS yield in the latter two ﬁgures was calculated for
the two considered types of the distribution functions: obtained
using Boltzmann equation solver and corrected for mean energy
before collisions. The eﬀect of the corrected functions resulted
in an increase of the EL yield by a factor of 2 for NBrS electro-
luminescence, indicating that the prediction uncertainty of the
theory developed here is not that small. Within this uncertainty,
as one can see from Fig. 13, the ordinary electroluminescence
yield calculated in this work is consistent with that of using mi-
croscopic approach [15].

The NBrS EL yield in the 0-1000 nm range is of practical
importance, since its long-wavelength limit is deﬁned by SiPM
sensitivity, thereby representing the maximum number of NBrS
photons that can ever be detected by existing devices. The
NBrS EL yield in the 0-10000 nm range is of hypothetical inter-
est: it demonstrates that the NBrS signal could be considerably

in the infrared.

One can see from Fig. 12 that the NBrS EL yield ﬁrst in-
creases with the ﬁeld, then saturates and even decreases at some
ﬁeld values (in contrast to photon energy intensity that increases
monotonically with the ﬁeld). Such a behavior, at a slowly vary-
ing elastic cross section (shown in Fig. 3), reﬂects that of the
υe/υd ratio: see Fig. 6 and Eq. 8.

Finally, let us discuss the enhancement of NBrS emission
on resonance, considered above. One of the suggested mech-
anisms of the enhancement is that the electron attachment on
the resonance level and the subsequent decay of the negative
ion are accompanied by photon emission [46]:

e− + Ar → Ar− + hν ;
Ar− → e− + Ar + hν .

(14)

(15)

In [46] these processes were calculated for atomic nitrogen us-
ing the electron radial wave functions on the resonance (extrap-
olated from the other state): it was shown that the NBrS eﬀect
on N− resonance may enhance the overall NBrS intensity by
an order of magnitude.
It is obvious that for each particular
resonance the degree of such enhancement is diﬀerent. Un-
fortunately for Ar− resonance these radial wave functions are
unknown; accordingly, the calculations cannot be performed at
the moment.
It should be remarked that since the resonance
levels (11.10 eV and 11.28 eV) are very close to those of exci-
tation (11.55 eV), the eﬀect of neutral bremsstrahlung electro-
luminescence on resonance would have the same threshold for
the electric ﬁeld as that of ordinary electroluminescence, i.e.
around 4.0 Td. Below this threshold, the NBrS eﬀect on reso-
nance would not come into force and thus the predictions of the
theory would not change.

Summarizing, the theory of neutral bremsstrahlung predicts
the following properties of proportional electroluminescence in
two-phase Ar:
1) electroluminescence below the Ar excitation threshold, in the
UV, visible and NIR regions;
2) appreciable non-VUV component above the Ar excitation
threshold, extending from the UV to NIR.

In the following sections, we will see how much these pre-

dictions of the theory are conﬁrmed in experiment.

4. Experimental setup and procedures

The experimental setup was similar to that used in our pre-
vious measurements [18]: see Fig. 14. The setup included a
two-phase detector with EL gap, ﬁlled with 2.5 liters of liq-
In contrast to previous measurements where Ar was
uid Ar.
doped with N2 [16, 17, 18], in this work we used pure Ar. Ar-
gon, of an initial purity of 99.9998%, was used on a closed
loop; it was puriﬁed from electronegative impurities by Ox-
isorb ﬁlter each time during the cooling procedure, providing
electron life-time in the liquid >100 µs [17]. The N2 content
was below 1 ppm (with the measurement accuracy of 1 ppm); it
was constantly monitored before and after each cryogenic run

using gas analyzer ”SVET” [48], which employed emission-
spectrum-measurement technique. The detector was operated
in a two-phase mode in the equilibrium state, at a saturated va-
por pressure of 1.000±0.005 atm and at a temperature of 87.3
K.

Figure 14: Schematic view of the experimental setup (not to scale).

The EL gap, formed by the liquid surface and a THGEM
plate (THGEM1 in the ﬁgure), was viewed by four compact 2-
inch PMTs R6041-506MOD [49, 50], located on the perimeter
of the gap. The PMTs were electrically insulated from the gap
by an acrylic box. Three of the four PMTs were made sen-
sitive to the VUV emission of pure Ar by depositing a WLS
ﬁlms (based on TPB in polystyrene matrix [51]) on the inner
box surface facing the EL gap in front of these PMTs. Let us
designate this readout conﬁguration as 3PMT+WLS.

An important modiﬁcation of the setup compared to that of
[16, 18] was that one of the four PMTs was intentionally left
insensitive to the VUV (1PMT readout conﬁguration). Instead,
its sensitivity to the UV was provided, starting from 300 nm:
in place of the acrylic with the WLS ﬁlm, a hole was made in
the box, which was isolated from the EL gap by an UV-acrylic
plate transparent above 300 nm.

The EL gap was also viewed by a 11x11 SiPM-matrix from
the top, through an acrylic plate and a THGEM, with a spec-
tral sensitivity ranging from the near UV (360 nm) to the NIR
(1000 nm). Only the central SiPM, of 6x6 mm2 area and MPPC
13360-6050PE type [52], was used in the present work; it was
operated at overvoltage of either 3.6 or 5.6 V.

Another modiﬁcation was that we used one THGEM in front
of the SiPM matrix, instead of the two in [16, 18], for simplic-
ity and to increase the SiPM-matrix response in direct optical
readout of the EL gap in future studies. The detector was irradi-
ated from outside by X-rays from a pulsed X-ray tube with the
average energy of 25 keV [36], those from 109Cd source with
the energy of 22-25 and 88 keV, and those from 241Am source
with the energy of 60 keV.

ing fast 10-fold ampliﬁers CAEN N979; the fast output sig-
nals were used in time measurements for pulse-shape analysis.
The signals from the 3 PMTs with WLS were summed (using
CAEN N625 unit) and re-ampliﬁed with a linear ampliﬁer with
a shaping time of 200 ns, for the subsequent amplitude analysis.
The same was done for the PMT without WLS. The SiPM sig-
nals were recorded using dedicated fast ampliﬁers with a shap-
ing time of 40 ns.

The DAQ system included both a 4-channel oscilloscope
LeCroy WR HRO 66Zi and a 64-channel Flash ADC CAEN
V1740 (12 bits, 62.5 MHz):
the signals were digitized and
stored both in the oscilloscope and in a computer for further
oﬀ-line analysis.

ciency (QE) [52, 53], SiPM Photon Detection Eﬃciency (PDE)
[35, 52, 54], transmittance of the ordinary and UV acrylic plate
in front of the SiPM and 1PMT, respectively, and WLS hemi-
spherical transmittance [55]. In addition, the emission spectrum
of the WLS [51] is presented. These data were used to deter-
mine the absolute EL yield.

1PMT, respectively, measured by us, and hemispherical transmittance of the
WLS (TPB in polystyrene) [55]. Also shown is the emission spectrum of the
WLS (TPB in polystyrene) [51].

Thus we had three ways of optical readout of the EL gap,
with the appropriate photodetector conﬁguration designated
here as 1PMT, 3PMT+WLS and SiPM. Such a combination
of photodetectors, sensitive in diﬀerent spectral ranges, made
it possible to assess the spectral composition of EL radiation.
The appropriate EL gap yield is deﬁned as the number of pho-
toelectrons recorded by any conﬁguration (Npe), normalized to
the number of drifting electrons in the EL gap (qe):

YXX = Npe/qe ; XX=1PMT, 3PMT+WLS or SiPM .

(16)

At higher electric ﬁelds, qe was measured directly at the

8

THGEM1 electrode acting as an anode of the EL gap, using
a calibrated circuit of a preampliﬁer and shaping ampliﬁer. At
lower electric ﬁelds, qe was determined by extrapolation using
the ﬁeld dependence of the X-ray ionization yield in liquid Ar
[36]. At that, the electron transmission through the THGEM0
electrode, determined by us using 3D simulation, and the emis-
sion eﬃciency through the liquid-gas interface, studied else-
where [56], were taken constant in a given ﬁeld range.

The absolute EL yield deﬁned in Eq. 8 is rewritten here

through the quantities measured in experiment:

YEL = Nph/qe/d ,

(17)

where d is the EL gap thickness and the number of photons
recorded by the PMTs or SiPM is deﬁned as

Nph = Npe/PCE .

(18)
Here PCE is the photon-to-photoelectron conversion eﬃciency.
The number of photoelectrons Npe for a given readout conﬁgu-
ration was determined similarly to that described in [18].

All the EL emission components recorded in certain ways
can be grouped as follows. There are three basic components
for 3PMT+WLS readout: that of the VUV emission of ordi-
nary electroluminescence re-emitted by the WLS; that of the
UV emission of NBrS electroluminescence re-emitted by the
WLS; that of the visible emission of NBrS electroluminescence
recorded directly. There are two components for 1PMT read-
out: that of the UV and visible emission of NBrS electrolumi-
nescence; that of the optical cross-talk from the WLS ﬁlms in
front of the other 3 PMTs. There is one component for SiPM
readout: that of the UV, visible and NIR emission of NBrS elec-
troluminescence; the optical cross-talk from the WLS ﬁlms is
estimated to be negligible.

For the components where there is a WLS re-emission, we
have PCE = ε < CE >< QE >. For the components recorded
directly we have PCE = ε < QE > and PCE = ε < PDE >
for PMT and SiPM readout respectively. Here ε is the photon
collection eﬃciency; it was calculated using Monte-Carlo sim-
ulation procedures. < CE > is the WLS conversion eﬃciency
averaged over the appropriate emission spectrum, namely over
that of VUV of ordinary electroluminescence or that of UV of
NBrS electroluminescence. < QE > and < PDE > are the
PMT QE and SiPM PDE averaged over the appropriate emis-
sion spectrum and appropriately convolved with the WLS hemi-
spherical, acrylic or UV-acrylic transmittance spectrum given in
Fig. 15.

Regarding the conversion eﬃciency of the TPB-based WLS,
in our previous works [16, 18] we used CE = 0.58 around 128
nm [51], CE = 0.40 at 300-400 nm [51, 55, 57] and CE = 0
above 400 nm. However, the TPB conversion eﬃciency at 128
nm has recently been signiﬁcantly revised towards a decrease
the correction factor reached 2. Therefore we had to
[58]:
measure the WLS conversion eﬃciency ourselves, in our ex-
perimental setup. For this purpose, a cryogenic run was taken
to record a scintillation signal in liquid Ar (S1), at zero elec-
tric ﬁeld, induced by vertical tracks of cosmic muons selected
by scintillation counters. Knowing, ﬁrst, the value of the scin-
tillation yield for minimal ionizing particles, of 24.4±1 eV to

photon collection eﬃciency calculated by us using simulation
procedure, we came to the value of CE = 0.49 ± 0.02 which
is not far from that used before. Thus in the present work, we
used CE = 0.49 around 128 nm, CE = 0.40 at 300-400 nm and
CE = 0 above 400 nm.

Other details of the experimental setup and measurement

procedures were described elsewhere [18].

5. Electroluminescence yield: experiment versus theory

Figs. 16 and 17 show the experimental data on the EL gap
yield for 3PMT+WLS and 1PMT readout, along with the pre-
diction of the theory of NBrS electroluminescence (for 1PMT
readout). Initially the data included the contribution of optical
cross-talk to PMT signals due to WLS ﬁlms of the neighboring
PMTs. It was carefully determined by simulation, conﬁrmed
in special measurements, and then subtracted to obtain the true
EL gap yield. In particular, it was the largest for 1PMT read-
out, amounting to about 15% of the initial amplitude at higher
electric ﬁelds.

Figure 16: EL gap yield for 3PMT+WLS and 1PMT readout (optical cross-talk
due to WLS being subtracted), as a function of the reduced electric ﬁeld. For
convenience of comparison, the 3PMT+WLS yield is divided by 3. The insert
shows an enlarged view of the low-ﬁeld region. The appropriate electric ﬁeld
in gaseous Ar is also shown on the top axis. The prediction of the theory of
NBrS electroluminescence for 1PMT readout is also shown. The hatched area
indicates the theory uncertainty due to electron energy distribution functions
obtained using Boltzmann equation (lower limit) and corrected for mean energy
before collisions (upper limit) (see Fig. 12).

At ﬁrst glance, Figs. 16 conﬁrm the ordinary ﬁeld depen-
dence of the EL yield: proportional electroluminescence starts
at some threshold electric ﬁeld, of about of 4.0 Td, correspond-
ing to the commencement of atomic excitations, and then lin-
early increases with the ﬁeld. However, closer examination re-
veals two remarkable properties of proportional electrolumines-
cence. First, there is an under-threshold electroluminescence,

9

below the Ar excitation threshold, where the non-VUV compo-
nent fully dominates. Second, there is an appreciable contribu-
tion of the non-VUV component above the threshold.

These properties are characterized by a relatively strong re-
sponse of the bare PMT to proportional electroluminescence:
its amplitude is as large as 40% of the amplitude of the PMT
with WLS at a higher ﬁeld, at 8.3 Td. At ﬁeld values below 4.6
Td (corresponding to that of operating ﬁeld of the DarkSide-50
experiment [8]), the amplitude of the bare PMT starts exceeding
that of the PMT with WLS. It should be remarked that the PMT
with WLS is 2-3 times less sensitive to NBrS electrolumines-
cence than the bare PMT, since a signiﬁcant part of the NBrS
spectrum (below 400 nm, see Figs. 9 and 15) is re-emitted by
the WLS and thus is suppressed by about a factor of 15-20 [16].
Fig. 18 showing the EL gap yield for SiPM readout, fully
conﬁrms the results on the non-VUV component obtained us-
ing 1PMT readout: electroluminescence below the Ar excita-
tion threshold and the constantly increasing EL yield above the
threshold.

One can see from Figs. 16, 17 and 18 that the non-VUV com-
ponent is well described by the NBrS theory (within the theoret-
ical uncertainty) at lower electric ﬁelds, below the Ar excitation
threshold at 4.0 Td. At higher ﬁelds, above the threshold, the
theory quickly diverges from the experiment. Back in the 80s, it
was suggested how to eliminate such a discrepancy [30, 45, 47]:
one should take into account the speciﬁc character of electron
scattering in the vicinity of Feshbach resonances. Firstly, one
should account for possible electron trapping at Feshbach reso-
nance energies [30, 45], which leads to the enrichment of the
high-energy tail of the electron energy distribution function.
Secondly, as discussed in Section 3, it was theoretically demon-
strated that the NBrS yield at resonance might be signiﬁcantly
enhanced [46, 47]. Relying on these hypotheses, we adopt here
the concept that all the data on non-VUV component are those
induced by NBrS electroluminescence.

This concept is conﬁrmed by the fact of the photon emis-

sion under the Ar excitation threshold in a wide spectral range,
which actually is a signature of the NBrS eﬀect. Another signa-
ture of the NBrS eﬀect is its fast emission nature, which is re-
vealed in time measurements, above the Ar excitation threshold.
In particular it is manifested when comparing the pulse shapes
of the signals from the EL gap for all three readout conﬁgura-
tions, at a reduced ﬁeld of 5.0 Td. Fig. 19 shows time spectra
of single photoelectron (pe) peaks for 3PMT+WLS (PMT#2),
1PMT and SiPM readout. The time spectra reﬂect the pulse-
shapes of the appropriate signals (though they may not com-
pletely correspond to the latter because of the possible pe peak
merging). At 5.0 Td, the pulse-shape for 3PMT+WLS readout
looks very similar to that of the DarkSide-50 experiment hav-
ing a close operating ﬁeld value (4.6 Td) [60]. One can see that
it has a fast and slow component, the latter having a time con-
stant of ∼3 µs and thus being attributed to the VUV emission of
2(3Σ+
the triplet excimer state Ar∗
u ) [13]. The fast component for
3PMT+WLS readout is combined from the non-VUV emission
due to NBrS eﬀect and the VUV emission of the singlet excimer
state Ar∗
u ), according to the current understanding of the
EL mechanism. For 1PMT and SiPM readout, the pulse-shape
is diﬀerent: it has basically the fast component only. This is
the signature of the NBrS emission in the non-VUV range. The
pulse width at half maximum of this fast component is equal to
the electron drift time across the EL gap at a given electric ﬁeld,
thus conﬁrming the statement that the signals are produced in
the gas in the EL gap (and not in the liquid). The detailed study
of time characteristics of the two-phase argon detector will be
presented in our next paper.

2(1Σ+

Adopting the paradigm of the NBrS nature of the non-VUV
component, we can determine the true EL gap yield for ordi-
nary (VUV) electroluminescence from the 3PMT+WLS data,

luminescence as a function of the reduced electric ﬁeld, where the non-VUV

enlarged view of the low-ﬁeld region.

where the non-VUV component is subtracted using the 1PMT
and SiPM data, Here the shapes of emission spectra of the non-
VUV component were provided by the NBrS theory (Fig. 9).
The result is shown in Fig. 20. It can be seen that in the ab-
sence of under-threshold radiation, the threshold of VUV elec-
troluminescence, at 4.0 Td, is much more clearly deﬁned. One
can also see that the 1PMT and SiPM data lead to compatible
results. Taking the average between them, we arrive at the ﬁ-
nal Fig. 21, showing the reduced EL yield for ordinary (VUV)
electroluminescence obtained in this work and compared to the

it acts only in the liquid phase. Moreover, it was shown in [61]
that the WLS ﬁlms composed of non-saturated TPB in poly-
mer matrix, i.e. similarly to that used in our experiment (1 part
of TPB per 3 parts of polystyrene [16]), are resistant to dis-
solving in liquid Ar. Summarizing, it is diﬃcult to imagine the
EL mechanism other than that of NBrS that could coherently
explain the observed phenomena in total, including electrolu-
minescence under the Ar excitation threshold, its fast emission
nature, the non-VUV emission above the threshold and its spe-
ciﬁc spectral composition recorded in concert by diﬀerent spec-
tral devices like that of PMT and SiPM.

Thereby in this work, we got closer to resolving the problem
of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar, identiﬁed
in [13, 18]. Following [13], it can be stated that the admixture
of N2 to Ar, at a content of the order of 50 ppm, cannot be
responsible for the non-VUV component in proportional elec-
troluminescence observed earlier in [16, 18]. Most probably
it is neutral bremsstrahlung responsible for that. The question
still remaining unanswered is that of the EL yield enhancement
observed in [16, 18]. What unites those works is that the mea-
surements were performed with freshly prepared WLS ﬁlms.
Accordingly, a WLS instability might be the explanation of the
observed enhancement. Indeed, there are indications that WLS
ﬁlms, ﬁrst showing high conversion eﬃciency, can then degrade
with a half life varying from ten days to several months, de-
pending on the intensity of light irradiation [62].

The important result of this work is that the amplitude of
the S2 signal from the bare PMT (without WLS) was shown
to be comparable with that of the PMT with WLS, in the ab-
sence of optical contact between the WLS and the PMT. The
latter condition resulted in that the photon ﬂux is considerably
reduced after re-emission by the WLS, by about a factor of 15-
20 [16, 18], due to re-emission and total reﬂection losses. The
S2 amplitude can be further increased, by a factor of 2, if to
replace the bare PMTs with the SiPM-matrices, since the latter
have higher PDE and wider range of sensitivity to NBrS spec-
tra. This is conﬁrmed by convolving the spectra from Figs. 9
and 15. This observation paves the way for direct readout of
the S2 signal in two-phase dark matter detectors, using PMTs
and SiPM-matrices.

The presence of the NBrS component in proportional electro-
luminescence may result in suggesting to analyze the S2 pulse-
shape in a new way, in particular in two-phase Ar dark matter
detectors [60, 63]. For example, at 4.6 Td (i.e. just at operating
ﬁeld of the DarkSide-50 experiment) one has to take into ac-
count the substantial enhancement of the fast component due to
NBrS electroluminescence: based on the analysis of Figs. 8, 15
and 16, the NBrS contribution to the total S2 signal recorded
by PMTs with WLS is estimated to be about 50%. In princi-
ple, such an enhancement of the fast component can aﬀect the
algorithm for decomposing the S2 signal into a fast and slow
component, which in turn can aﬀect the determination of the
quantities using the fast component, such as the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients in liquid Ar [60] or z-coordinate ﬁducialization.

It should be emphasized that NBrS electroluminescence has
a universal character: it should be present in all noble gases,

imental data, where the non-VUV component (averaged over 1PMT and SiPM

cence model. For comparison, the yields in gaseous Ar in the VUV obtained

[15]) are presented.

yields at room temperature obtained experimentally [14] and
theoretically [15]. Fig. 21 demonstrates a convincing agree-
ment between the EL yield of ordinary electroluminescence de-
termined here in the two-phase mode, and that of calculated by
the theory using microscopic approach [15].

6. Discussion and possible applications of NBrS electrolu-

minescence

First of all, we shall try to prove that there is no rational
mechanism other than that of NBrS, which would be able to
explain electroluminescence in the non-VUV range and under
the Ar excitation threshold. Indeed, physics of electrolumines-
cence is an exact science: all the reaction rate constants of pos-
sible EL mechanisms in the presence of impurities are known
[13], allowing to rule out their eﬀect on electroluminescence at
the given impurity content limits. In our experiment this limit
was below 1 ppm for N2, Xe and other non-electronegative im-
purities in total, while for electronegative (oxygen-equivalent)
impurities it was below 5 ppb (corresponding to the electron
lifetime in liquid Ar exceeding 100 µs). With such vanishingly
small impurity contents, there is only one known mechanism
that can explain the EL eﬀect under the Ar excitation threshold,
namely that of neutral bremsstrahlung. Above the Ar excita-
tion threshold, these content values are several orders of mag-
nitude smaller than those at which the excitation transfer from
Ar species to impurities could take place. In particular for N2
the eﬀective excitation transfer in the gas phase starts at >103
ppm, while for Xe it does not occur at all due to extremely low
value of the saturated vapor pressure [13]. Finally, regarding
possible eﬀect of dissolving of the TPB-based WLS in liquid

11

NBrS electroluminescence is present in S2 signals of two-phase
Xe detectors [5, 6, 7, 12], including those of Liquid Hole Mul-
tiplier [64]. Presumably it has not been yet observed due to the
fact that the S2 signal in Xe is recorded directly using PMTs
with quartz windows (i.e. unlike Ar, without losses due to re-
emission in WLS), and at higher electric ﬁelds, to provide eﬃ-
cient extraction of the electrons from liquid Xe. This left almost
no chance for NBrS signal to be observed at the background of
a strong main signal: this is evident from Fig. 13 while compar-
ing the EL yields of ordinary and NBrS electroluminescence at
higher electric ﬁelds.

It is not yet clear how large the contribution of NBrS elec-
troluminescence is in avalanche scintillations, which are used
in combined THGEM/SiPM [34, 65] and THGEM/CCD [66]
multipliers. So far, direct recording of avalanche scintilla-
tions by SiPMs was considered to be provided by the NIR
emission of higher-level argon excitation states Ar∗(3p54p1)
[13, 34, 67, 68].

We may also suppose that the NBrS eﬀect can be responsible
for proportional electroluminescence observed in liquid Ar and
Xe using immersed GEM-like structures [34, 69, 70]. At ﬁrst
glance it might not be the case, since the liquid Ar density at
87 K is 244 times larger than that of gaseous Ar [13], result-
ing in appropriate reduction of E/N values (in the ﬁrst approx-
imation liquid Ar can be considered as a strongly compressed
gas, obeying the E/N scaling law [71]). However at a closer
look, it turns out that the electric ﬁelds in the center of GEM or
THGEM holes used in liquid Ar, of 60-140 kV/cm [34], corre-
spond to E/N = 0.3 − 0.7 Td which are not that small. For such
reduced electric ﬁelds, the theory predicts that NBrS electrolu-
minescence already exists: see Figs. 12 and 13. It also predicts
the linear dependence of the EL yield observed in experiment.
Thus, one cannot exclude the NBrS origin of proportional elec-
troluminescence in liquid noble gases.

It is also worth mention the application of NBrS radiation
which is already used in practice to develop a detection tech-
nique for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays [28]. Here the NBrS
radiation in the radio-frequency range (to be recored with an-
tennas on the Earth surface) is emitted by primary ionization
electrons left after the passage of the showers in the atmosphere.
In the method developed in [28] to calculate the NBrS signal,
Eq. 4 was used and non-stationary Boltzmann equation was
solved to obtain the energy distribution functions of the primary
ionization electrons.

This phenomenon could in principle explain the weak pri-
mary scintillations in liquid Ar in the visible and NIR range,
observed earlier by a number of groups [67, 72, 73], Indeed, if
the secondary scintillation in the VUV in gaseous Ar (S2 signal)
is associated with the primary scintillation in the VUV in liquid
Ar (S1 signal), why does this not happen with the NBrS scin-
tillation? Following [28], such primary scintillations in liquid
Ar in the visible and NIR range might be explained by neutral
bremsstrahlung of the primary ionization electrons.

7. Conclusions

In this work we have studied an additional mechanism of
proportional electroluminescence (EL) in gaseous Ar in the
two-phase mode, namely that of neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS)
of drifting electrons, acting concurrently with that of ordinary
electroluminescence. It was shown that the NBrS eﬀect can ex-
plain two intriguing observations in EL radiation: that of the
substantial contribution of the non-VUV spectral component,
extending from the UV to NIR, and that of the photon emis-
sion at lower electric ﬁelds, below the Ar excitation threshold.
Hence, the NBrS eﬀect has partially resolved the problem of
proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar, identiﬁed in
[13, 18].

The merit of the present work is that it transformed the idea
of NBrS electroluminescence from a hypothesis into a quanti-
tative theory. The success of the NBrS theory developed here is
that it correctly predicts the absolute value of the EL yield be-
low the Ar excitation threshold. The success of both the exper-
iment and the theory is that the data, obtained by three diﬀerent
readout techniques, namely using PMTs with WLS, bare PMT
and SiPM, become consistent if to use the NBrS electrolumi-
nescence spectra. This resulted in that the EL yield of ordinary
electroluminescence (in the VUV) has for the ﬁrst time been
correctly determined in gaseous Ar at cryogenic temperature,
in the two-phase mode.

The main practical application of the NBrS eﬀect is a better
understanding of the S2 signal and justiﬁcation for its direct
(without WLS) optical readout using PMTs and SiPM-matrices,
which may help to develop two-phase dark matter and neutrino
detectors of ultimate sensitivity.
