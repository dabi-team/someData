Abstract. We review experimental and theoretical cross sections for electron scattering in nitric
oxide (NO) and form a comprehensive set of plausible cross sections. To assess the accuracy and
self-consistency of our set, we also review electron swarm transport coeﬃcients in pure NO and
admixtures of NO in Ar, for which we perform a multi-term Boltzmann equation analysis. We
address observed discrepancies with these experimental measurements by training an artiﬁcial
neural network to solve the inverse problem of unfolding the underlying electron-NO cross sections,
while using our initial cross section set as a base for this reﬁnement. In this way, we reﬁne a
suitable quasielastic momentum transfer cross section, a dissociative electron attachment cross
section and a neutral dissociation cross section. We conﬁrm that the resulting reﬁned cross section
set has an improved agreement with the experimental swarm data over that achieved with our
initial set. We also use our reﬁned data base to calculate electron transport coeﬃcients in NO,
across a large range of density-reduced electric ﬁelds from 0.003 Td to 10,000 Td.

1. Introduction

Plasma medicine is a relatively new ﬁeld that employs low-temperature atmospheric pressure
plasmas (LTAPP), in order to induce beneﬁcial eﬀects in biological tissue [1–4]. Key to these
beneﬁts is the formation and subsequent synergistic interactions of reactive oxygen and nitrogen
species (RONS) [1]. The accurate modelling, control, and optimisation of LTAPP for plasma
medicine applications is dependent on a complete and detailed understanding of all plasma-tissue
interactions, of which one important subset is the interaction of electrons with RONS [2–4]. One
of the most important RONS is nitric oxide (NO) [1], which has been identiﬁed as being eﬀective
in both tissue disinfection [5] and apoptosis of cancer cells [6, 7]. A precise description of the
interactions between electrons and NO, in the form of electron-impact cross sections [8], is thus
important for the predictive understanding of many plasma treatments. With this motivation in
mind, in this investigation, we compile a comprehensive set of electron-NO cross sections that
attempts to address the shortcomings of those already available in the literature.

To ensure the accuracy and self-consistency of our electron-NO cross section set, we calculate
corresponding electron swarm transport coeﬃcients for comparison with measurements in the
literature. Any discrepancies observed in the swarm parameters can then be addressed through
appropriate reﬁnements of the cross section set. This inverse swarm problem of unfolding cross
sections from swarm measurements has a long and successful history [9–16]. Nevertheless, when
the amount of available swarm data becomes limited, the inverse swarm problem becomes ill-
posed and is no longer guaranteed to have a unique solution. Traditionally, this diﬃculty was
overcome by relying on an expert in swarm analysis to rule out unphysical solutions and to select
the solution that is the most physically plausible. Recently, however, Stokes et al. were able to avoid
this time-consuming and possibly subjective process of manual iterative reﬁnement by employing
an artiﬁcial neural network model [17], to solve the inverse swarm problem for the biomolecule
analogues tetrahydrofuran (THF, C4H8O) [18] and α-tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA, C5H10O2)
[19], with the former result being found to be of comparable quality to a conventional reﬁnement “by
hand” [20]. This application of machine learning was originally proposed by Morgan [21] in the early
1990s. Given that machine learning has in recent years been applied to problems from all ﬁelds of
science, including chemical physics [22], revisiting the proposal of Morgan with a modern machine
learning methodology and hardware was certainly overdue. However, most pivotal to the procedure
of Stokes et al. was their use of the LXCat project [23–25], allowing for their neural network to be
trained on a wealth of “real” cross sections, thus allowing their model to “learn” what constitutes a
physically-plausible cross section set. In this work, we employ a similar machine learning approach
to automatically and objectively reﬁne electron-NO cross sections given independent experimental
swarm data.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we review relevant experimental
and theoretical cross sections and assemble our initial electron-NO cross section database. In Sec. 3,
we assess the accuracy and self-consistency of our initial set by simulating corresponding transport
coeﬃcients, using a multi-term Boltzmann equation solver, and comparing them to experimental
measurements present in the literature. Sec. 4 details our data-driven approach to the swarm
analysis of this experimental data and presents the resulting reﬁnements to our initial cross section
set. Sec. 5 assesses to what extent our reﬁned set improves the agreement with experimental
swarm data over what we proposed initially. We also use our reﬁned set here to calculate transport
coeﬃcients for electrons in NO across a large range of density-reduced electric ﬁelds. Finally, Sec.
6 presents our conclusions and makes some suggestions for future work.

2. Initial cross section compilation

There have been three comprehensive attempts to compile cross section data for electron scattering
from NO. The ﬁrst, by Brunger and Buckman [26], is now quite dated and so does not ﬁgure in what
follows. The second was by Professor Y. Itikawa [27], perhaps the doyen of scientists who collect
and evaluate cross section data, while the most recent was from Song et al. [28]. In his compilation,
Itikawa [27] reported data for the grand total cross section (TCS), elastic integral cross section
(ICS), elastic momentum transfer cross section (MTCS), vibrational excitation ICS for the 0 → 1,
0 → 2 and 0 → 3 quanta, a subset of the electronic-state ICS, a total ionisation cross section
(TICS) and a dissociative electron attachment (DEA) cross section. Unfortunately, in many cases
his recommendations did not cover a broad enough energy range, nor were all the possible open
channels considered (neutral dissociation [ND] was not addressed), to fulﬁl the criteria of Tanaka et
al. [8] and Brunger [29] that data bases for modelling and simulation studies (e.g. [20, 30–32]) must
be comprehensive and complete. Song et al.
[28], where possible, updated the Itikawa data base
and then used that as a starting point to solve the inverse electron-swarm problem [19] in NO. In
that approach, ICSs are varied, in conjunction with a two-term approximation Boltzmann equation
solver [24], in order to force agreement between the simulated and measured transport coeﬃcient
data [28]. The so-determined ICS set then became their recommended cross section data base for
the e + NO collision system. We have several reservations with the work of Song et al. [28]. Firstly,
there is no a priori rationale provided by Song et al. [28] for why the two-term approximation to
solving Boltzmann’s equation should be valid for all the transport coeﬃcients they simulated over
the range of E/n0 (E = applied electric ﬁeld strength; n0 = number density of the background gas
[i.e. NO here] through which the electron swarm drifts and diﬀuses) they considered. Indeed, in Sec
3, we apply a multi-term Boltzmann solver and determine that the two-term approximation has not
converged suﬃciently for some of the measurements considered in their swarm analysis. Secondly,
as part of their swarm analysis, Song et al.
[33] who
determined their transport coeﬃcients from measured distributions of electron arrival times [33]. It
is known that these resulting “arrival time spectra” transport coeﬃcients are distinct from the bulk
(centre-of-mass) transport coeﬃcients provided by many Boltzmann solvers [34, 35] and it is not
clear whether Song et al. [28] have taken this into account when performing their swarm analysis.
Finally, the ill-posed nature of the inverse swarm problem [18] can potentially lead to uniqueness
issues in the cross sections derived. Namely, while the ICSs determined by Song et al. [28] do lead
to transport coeﬃcients that are largely consistent with the available swarm data they might not
be the only set that does so. Under those circumstances the Song et al. [28] data base might not
be physical. As a consequence of those concerns, we assemble our initial e + NO cross section data
base by using extensively the work of Itikawa [27].

[28] use the swarm data of Takeuchi et al.

Brunger et al. [36] reported ICSs for 28 excited electronic states of NO, but only over the limited
incident electron energy range 15–50 eV. Cartwright et al. [37] extended a subset of 9 of those cross
sections, to their various threshold energies and out to 500 eV, in order to study the excited-state
densities and band emissions of NO under auroral conditions. Here we extend the remaining 19
excited electronic-state ICSs to their respective threshold energies [38] and out to 500 eV, with
all of these electronic-state ICSs being plotted in Fig. 1. Note that Xu et al.
[39] reported some
BEf -scaling [8] theoretical results for the A2Σ+, C 2Π and D2Σ+ electronic states, and found good
agreement with the ICSs of Brunger et al. [36] for the A- and C- states. For the D-state, however,
a discrepancy was noted although that may reﬂect on the applicability of using the BEf -scaling
approach for an electronic state with such a small optical oscillator strength [40]. For vibrational

excitation we essentially adopt Figure 1 from Campbell et al.
[41], which was constructed from
the low-energy results of Josić et al. [42] and Jelisavcic et al. [43] and the higher-energy results of
Mojarrabi et al. [44]. All these ICSs, for the ν = 0–1, 0–2 and 0–3 vibrational quanta, are plotted
in Fig. 1. The present DEA cross sections were taken directly from Table 6 of Itikawa [27], being
originally sourced from the work of Rapp and Briglia [45] (see Fig. 1). Similarly, the present TICS
was taken directly from Table 5 of Itikawa [27], with the origin of the cross sections in this case
being from Lindsay et al.
[46] (again see Fig. 1). In the case of the elastic scattering, our initial
data set is constructed below 3.38 eV by subtracting the present vibrational ICSs of Fig. 1 from the
TCS measurement of Alle et al. [47]. Above 3.38 eV we use the recommended data from Table 2 of
Itikawa [27]. The present elastic ICSs are also plotted in our Fig. 1. The TCSs of our initial cross
section compilation were formed as follows. Below an incident electron energy of 2.6 eV we used
the values of Alle et al. [47], as digitised from their Figure 1, while for E0 above 5 eV we employed
the values from Table 1 in Itikawa [27]. Between 2.6 eV and 5 eV we undertook an interpolation
that ensured that the TCSs of Alle et al. [47] merged smoothly with those recommended by Itikawa
[27]. The resultant TCS from this process is shown pictorially in Fig. 1. Finally, there remains
the neutral dissociation cross section. There are no known measurements or calculations for the
ND ICS in e + NO scattering, so our approach for estimating it was as follows. The sum of the
individual ICSs, for all open scattering channels at some E0, should be consistent with the TCS,
at least to within the uncertainties on the TCS. In this case, we found that when we summed all
our ICSs there was a quite narrow energy region (∼ 5 – 20 eV) where it underestimated the TCS
(to well outside the error on our TCS). We therefore assigned that residual cross section strength
to be the ICS for ND, with our derived result again being plotted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 therefore summarises all the ICSs and the TCS that constitute our initial cross section
compilation for input into our multi-term Boltzmann equation solver [18, 19], in order to determine
transport coeﬃcients that can be compared to corresponding independent results from electron-
swarm experiments. The present error estimates on those ICSs and the TCS largely reﬂect those
given in the original papers, from which our initial data base was derived. Typically, this would be
∼ ±25% on the elastic ICS, ∼ ±30% on the vibrational excitation ICS, ∼ ±7% on the TICS, in the
range of ∼ ±25%–70% for the various electronic-state ICS, ∼ ±30% on the DEA ICS and ∼ ±80%
on the ND ICS that we have derived. The independent TCS data set would have an error of ∼ ±7%,
a little more than cited in the relevant papers as we have included a small additional uncertainty
due to the so-called “forward angle scattering eﬀect” [48] that was previously not allowed for. It is
important to remember that, when using this initial cross section compilation in conjunction with
a multi-term Boltzmann equation solver, the errors on the ICSs will in principle necessarily lead to
a band of allowed solutions for the transport coeﬃcients that are to be simulated.

Another observation we should make in respect to Fig. 1 is that it is clear that the TCS we
determine from adding up all our various ICSs (denoted by - - - in black and called “Final TCS”)
is entirely consistent with the TCS we derived from the independent measurements available to us
(denoted by — - — in red). While this is a necessary condition for a cross section compilation
to be plausibly physical, as we saw in our work on THF [18] and THFA [19] it by no means a
priori guarantees that the simulated transport coeﬃcients will reproduce the available swarm data.
Finally, it is also relevant to note here that all the ICSs in the present compilation are rotationally
averaged, which is a direct result of the energy resolution of current-day electron spectrometers not
being narrow enough to resolve the various rotational lines [26].

3. Multi-term Boltzmann equation analysis of our initial set

To assess the quality of our initial set of electron-NO cross sections, we apply a well-benchmarked
multi-term solution of Boltzmann’s equation [32, 49, 50] in order to calculate swarm transport
coeﬃcients for comparison to measured values in the literature. Chronologically, electron-NO
swarm measurements include drift velocities and transverse characteristic energies by Skinker et
al. [51] and Bailey et al. [52], transverse characteristic energies by Townsend [53], drift velocities
and attachment coeﬃcients by Parkes et al. [54], transverse characteristic energies and ionisation
coeﬃcients by Lakshminarasimha et al.
[55], transverse and longitudinal characteristic energies
by Mechlińska-Drewko et al.
[56], and, most recently, drift velocities and longitudinal diﬀusion
coeﬃcients by Takeuchi et al. [33] (for both pure NO and admixtures of NO in Ar).

[55], the attachment coeﬃcients of Parkes et al.

When performing a Boltzmann equation swarm analysis, it is essential to precisely interpret
what is being measured in each swarm experiment under consideration [34, 57]. In this regard, many
of the earlier electron-NO measurements are inadequate as they are obtained using a “magnetic
deﬂection” experiment [58] that measures a drift velocity that is distinct from the bulk (centre-of-
mass) drift velocity measured in pulsed-Townsend experiments [57] and provided by our Boltzmann
solver. Ultimately, we choose to calculate comparisons to the drift velocities and longitudinal
[33], the ionisation coeﬃcients of Lakshminarasimha et
diﬀusion coeﬃcients of Takeuchi et al.
al.
[54], the transverse characteristic energies of
Lakshminarasimha et al. [55] and Mechlińska-Drewko et al. [56], and the longitudinal characteristic
energies of Mechlińska-Drewko et al. [56] and Takeuchi et al. [33] (calculated using their drift and
diﬀusion measurements). We purposefully leave out the 421 K measurements of Parkes et al.
[54], due to an observed pressure dependence in their measured attachment coeﬃcients that they
attribute to electron detachment from product ions at this temperature. We also neglect the pure
[33] below 11 Td, due to the pressure dependence
NO diﬀusion measurements of Takeuchi et al.
arising from three-body attachment in this low E/n0 regime [54, 59]. While their associated drift
velocity measurements also show a pressure dependence, it is to a far lesser extent and Takeuchi
et al.
[33] are able to consistently estimate pressure-independent values by extrapolation to zero
pressure [33]. In almost all cases considered, we interpret swarm measurements as pertaining to
the centre of mass of the swarm (i.e. bulk transport coeﬃcients). The only exception we make
is for the double-shutter drift tube experiment of Takeuchi et al. [33], which measures an “arrival
time spectra” drift velocity, Wm, that is distinct from the bulk drift velocity when nonconservative
eﬀects are present [34]. Fortunately, we can approximate this quantity in terms of our simulated
bulk transport coeﬃcients with [35]:

(1)
where W is the bulk drift velocity, αeﬀ is the eﬀective ﬁrst Townsend ionisation coeﬃcient, and DL
is the bulk longitudinal diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

Wm ≈ W − 2αeﬀ DL,

To perform the transport calculations, we require an appropriate quasielastic (elastic+rotation)
momentum transfer cross section, which we obtain by multiplying the present elastic ICS (from
Fig. 1) by the ratio of elastic MTCS to elastic ICS, each taken from the set of Itikawa [27].
When calculating the admixture transport coeﬃcients, we use the argon cross section set present in
the Biagi database [60–62]. The resulting simulated transport coeﬃcients are plotted alongside
the aforementioned experimental measurements in Figs.
2(a)–(f) for drift velocities, diﬀusion
coeﬃcients, ionisation coeﬃcients, attachment coeﬃcients, transverse characteristic energies, and
longitudinal characteristic energies, respectively. Fig. 2(a) shows a qualitative agreement between
[33]. In the case of pure
our simulated drift velocities and the measurements of Takeuchi et al.

8

NO, our initial cross section set results in drift velocities that are consistently too small below 2 Td
and too large above 2 Td. In the admixture cases, the onset of negative diﬀerential conductivity
(NDC) — the phenomenon of decreasing drift velocity with increasing E/n0 — occurs earlier in
our simulations than is shown by experiment. Fig. 2(b) indicates that our calculated longitudinal
diﬀusion coeﬃcients in pure NO are too large by roughly a factor of 2 on average. By comparison,
the calculated admixture diﬀusion coeﬃcients are much closer to the measurements and exhibit
many of their qualitative features. We note that the two-term approximation is in error by up to
40% for the longitudinal diﬀusion coeﬃcient measurements near 500 Td. It follows that a multi-term
Boltzmann solver is also necessary here for the accurate calculation of characteristic energies. Fig.
2(c) shows ionisation coeﬃcients calculated for our initial set that are generally larger than those
measured by Lakshminarasimha et al.
[55] (up to 75% larger in some instances). Quantitatively,
there is also room for improvement here. Fig. 2(d) shows the near absence of attachment in our
simulations below ∼ 15 Td, in stark contrast to the measurements of Parkes et al.
[54]. This
indicates the presence of a low-energy attachment process that is currently missing from our initial
set. Fig. 2(e) shows a good quantitative agreement between our calculated transverse characteristic
energies and those measured by Lakshminarasimha et al. [55]. However, the same cannot be said
for the measurements of Mechlińska-Drewko et al. [56] which, while qualitatively similar, tend to
be much smaller than what we calculate. Fig. 2(f) exhibits a disagreement between our calculated
longitudinal characteristic energies and the pure NO measurements of Mechlińska-Drewko et al.
[56] and Takeuchi et al. [33], both of which are consistently smaller than what we calculate. The
agreement is much better for the mixture measurements of Takeuchi et al.
[33], although the
simulations are still larger than expected in the case of the 4.99% NO in Ar measurements below 3
Td.

4. Cross section reﬁnement using data-driven swarm analysis

In the previous section, we have seen clear discrepancies between the transport coeﬃcients calculated
using our initial electron-NO cross section set and those determined experimentally by a number of
authors. In this section, we apply machine learning in order to reﬁne our initial set and hopefully
improve its agreement with the measured swarm data plotted in Fig. 2.

4.1. Machine learning methodology

To obtain a solution to the inverse swarm problem, we utilise the artiﬁcial neural network of Stokes
et al. [17–19]:

y (x) = (A4 ◦ mish ◦ A3 ◦ mish ◦ A2 ◦ mish ◦ A1) (x) ,

(2)

where An (x) ≡ Wnx + bn are aﬃne mappings deﬁned by dense weight matrices Wn and bias
vectors bn, and mish (x) = x tanh (ln (1 + ex)) is a nonlinear activation function [63] that is applied
element-wise. The output vector, y, contains each NO cross section of interest as a function of
energy, ε, which is an element of the input vector, x, alongside all of the swarm measurements
plotted in Fig. 2. It should be noted that we apply suitable logarithmic transformations to ensure
that all inputs and outputs of the network are dimensionless and lie within [−1, 1]. We specify that
each bias vector contains 256 parameters, with the exception of b4, the size of which must match
the number of cross sections in y. The weight matrices are all sized accordingly.

In order to train the neural network, Eq.

(2), we require an appropriate set of example
solutions to the inverse swarm problem. The choice of cross sections used for training is vital,

9

in order for the network to provide a self-consistent and physically-plausible set of cross sections
that are consistent within all the experimental error bars (including those on the TCS). We derive
such cross sections from the LXCat project [23–25], as described in detail in Sec. 4.2 for each
of the cross sections considered. Once suitable training cross sections are found, corresponding
transport coeﬃcients are determined using our multi-term Boltzmann solver [32, 49, 64] (here
we use a four-term approximation). A small amount of random noise is also multiplied by each
transport coeﬃcient to roughly imitate random experimental error. The logarithm of this noise
factor is sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.03
for the drift velocities, 0.05 for the diﬀusion coeﬃcients, and 0.1 for the ionisation coeﬃcients,
attachment coeﬃcients and characteristic energies considered.
We implement and train the neural network, Eq.

(2), using the Flux.jl machine learning
framework [65]. The network is initialised such that its biases are zero and its weights are uniform
random numbers, as described by Glorot and Bengio [66]. Training is performed using the AdaBelief
optimiser [67] with Nesterov momentum [68, 69], step size α = 10−3, exponential decay rates
β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999, and small parameter (cid:15) = 10−8. At each iteration, the optimiser is
provided with a diﬀerent batch of 4096 training examples, where each batch consists of 32 training
cross sections each evaluated at 128 random energies of the form ε = 10s where s ∈ [−2, 3] is
sampled from a continuous uniform distribution. For each batch, the optimiser adjusts the neural
network weights and biases with the aim of further minimising the mean absolute error in solving
the inverse swarm problem for that batch. Training is continued for 150,000 iterations, providing
an equal number of potential solutions to the inverse swarm problem. The quality of each of
these solutions is subsequently assessed by calculating their corresponding transport coeﬃcients
and comparing these to the swarm data plotted in Fig. 2. The set that agrees best with the swarm
measurements is presented below as our “reﬁned” set.

4.2. Reﬁned cross section set

Using our initial cross section set as a base, we apply the neural network, Eq. (2), to determine a
selection of plausible NO cross sections underlying the the swarm measurements shown in Fig. 2.
In particular, we determine cross sections for quasielastic (elastic+rotation) momentum transfer,
neutral dissociation, and dissociative electron attachment.

For dissociative electron attachment, we keep the cross section from the initial set and determine

an additional DEA cross section using physically-plausible training data of the form:

σ (ε) = σ1−r

1

(ε) σr

2 (ε) ,

(3)

where r ∈ [0, 1] is a mixing ratio sampled from a continuous uniform distribution, and σ1 (ε) and
σ2 (ε) are a random pair of attachment cross sections from the LXCat project [23–25]. Beyond the
implicit constraints due to the TCS (discussed below) and the physical constraints inherent to the
LXCat cross sections, we otherwise leave the DEA training cross sections completely unconstrained.
The resulting conﬁdence band of training examples is plotted in Fig. 3(b), alongside the reﬁned
ﬁt provided by the neural network. Fig. 3(a), on the other hand, simply shows that the DEA
cross section from the initial set has remained unchanged in the reﬁned set. As indicated by the
attachment coeﬃcient discrepancy shown in Fig. 2(d), the additional DEA cross section reﬁned in
Fig. 3(b) is largest at low energies. Below 0.1 eV, the reﬁned DEA is roughly constant at 10−22 m2,
a magnitude comparable to the peak of the other, higher-energy, DEA process kept from the initial
set. From 0.1 eV to 3 eV, the reﬁned DEA cross section decays roughly according to a power

reﬁned set alongside that from the initial set, (a). See also legends in ﬁgure.

law before vanishing. The reﬁnement increases only very slightly in the vicinity of the other DEA
process, near 9 eV, indicating that it is likely adequate as is.

For neutral dissociation, we found that ﬁtting a single unconstrained ND cross section resulted
in a reﬁnement with a threshold energy much lower than that for the ND proposed in the initial set
(∼ 5.5 eV). It was only after attempting a ﬁt with two unconstrained ND processes that a reﬁned
cross section of similar threshold energy arose. The training data used for these two processes took
the form:

σ (ε) = σ1−r

where σ1 (ε) and σ2 (ε) are a random pair of excitation cross sections from the LXCat project
[23–25], ε1 and ε2 are their respective threshold energies, and r ∈ [0, 1] is a uniformly sampled
mixing ratio. We additionally use rejection sampling to enforce that the threshold energies of the

section has a comparable threshold energy to the ND cross section from the initial set, which is
plotted alongside for comparison. See also legends in ﬁgure.

two ND processes are at least 1 eV apart. The resulting ND training example conﬁdence bands are
shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) indicates that the reﬁned higher-threshold ND process has a threshold
energy that is almost identical to its counterpart in the initial set (at ∼ 5.6 eV versus ∼ 5.5 eV).
While this reﬁnement increases slowly from threshold compared to its counterpart, it ultimately
reaches a slightly larger peak magnitude (1.35×10−20 m2 versus 1.05×10−20 m2) at a slightly lower
energy (11.7 eV versus 12.3 eV). Beyond this turning point, the reﬁnement decays monotonically,
transitioning to power-law above 50 eV before falling to 5 × 10−22 m2 by 1000 eV. This is in stark
contrast to the initial ND cross section, which lacks a high-energy tail due to its origin as a residual
ICS from the TCS. Fig. 4(b) shows that the reﬁned lower-threshold ND process has a threshold
energy of ∼ 0.35 eV. This reﬁned cross section increases rapidly from threshold, reaching a peak

magnitude of 3.4 × 10−20 m2 at 0.63 eV. The subsequent decay here is also monotonic, albeit
somewhat more erratic, reaching a minimum of 3.9 × 10−25 m2 by 1000 eV.

For the quasielastic momentum transfer cross section, we take a slightly diﬀerent approach by
using the neural network to determine a suitable energy-dependent scaling of the elastic ICS, which
upon application would yield the reﬁned quasielastic MTCS. The form of the scaling factors that
are used for training is:

where σ (ε) is the quasielastic MTCS used for training, σICS (ε) is the present elastic ICS, σQMTCS (ε)
is the present quasielastic MTCS (i.e. from the initial set), σ1 (ε) and σ2 (ε) are random elastic cross
sections formed from elastic cross sections on the LXCat project [23–25] that are combined using Eq.
(3), and r (ε) is a deterministic energy-dependent mixing ratio, used to constrain the quasielastic
MTCS training data to lie in the vicinity of the experimental measurements of Mojarrabi et al.

Further, to ensure each quasielastic MTCS decays at high energies, we used rejection sampling to
ensure that σ1 (1000 eV) < σ2 (1000 eV). The resulting quasielastic MTCS conﬁdence band can
be observed in Fig. 5, alongside the reﬁned ﬁt provided by the neural network, and the initial
quasielastic MTCS for comparison. We see that the reﬁned quasielastic MTCS is almost always
larger than that from our initial set, with the diﬀerence becoming greater at higher energies. The
greatest diﬀerence occurs at 103 eV, where the tail of the reﬁned quasielastic MTCS is almost an
order of magnitude larger than that for the initial set.

When sampling ND and DEA cross sections for training, we further employ rejection sampling
to only keep cross section sets for training that lie within ±7% of the grand TCS of our initial set
(while also accounting for the uncertainty in the elastic ICS of ±25%). The resulting conﬁdence
band in the grand TCS, due to the training examples, is plotted in Fig. 6, alongside our initial
and reﬁned grand TCSs. The reﬁned TCS is roughly the same as the initial TCS up until 10 eV,
beyond which the reﬁnement exceeds that we initially proposed. The greatest diﬀerence arises at
26 eV, with an increase in magnitude of 89%.

5. Multi-term Boltzmann equation analysis of our reﬁned set

5.1. Consistency with swarm measurements

Using our reﬁned set of electron-NO cross sections, we plot revised simulated transport coeﬃcients
in Figs. 7(a)–12(a) for comparison to the swarm measurements used to perform the reﬁnement,
as well as to the transport coeﬃcients calculated previously using our initial set. These
transport coeﬃcients are accompanied by corresponding percentage diﬀerence (error) plots in Figs.
7(b)–12(b). Here, positive percentage diﬀerences indicate that our simulated transport coeﬃcients
exceed their experimentally-measured counterparts. Fig. 7 shows that our reﬁned set has brought
the simulated drift velocities much closer to the experimental measurements of Takeuchi et al.

[33]. This agreement is particularly good for the pure NO measurements above 3 Td, with
the discrepancies at lower E/n0 possibly attributable to the drift velocities in this regime being
estimated from pressure-dependent measurements [33]. Fig. 8 shows a large improvement after
reﬁnement for the pure NO diﬀusion measurements of Takeuchi et al. [33]. However, the outcome
is somewhat more mixed in the case of diﬀusion measurements in the NO-Ar mixtures, with the
reﬁned set improving the agreement with some of the admixture measurements of Takeuchi et al.
[33], while worsening it with others. Fig. 9 shows a signiﬁcantly improved agreement between the
ionisation coeﬃcients of the reﬁned set and the measurements of Lakshminarasimha et al. [55]. As
this agreement was achieved without requiring adjustments to the initial TICS, this lends further
credence to the overall self-consistency of the reﬁnements that were made. Fig. 10 indicates that the
attachment coeﬃcient after reﬁnement is non-zero below 20 Td, and in line with the measurements

of Parkes et al. [54]. The accuracy here is now generally within ±50%, which is of the order of the
uncertainty in the experimental measurements. Fig. 11 shows a transverse characteristic energy
after reﬁnement that agrees much better with the measurements of Mechlińska-Drewko et al. [56]
and Lakshminarasimha et al.
[55], while Fig. 12 shows similar improvements for the simulated
longitudinal characteristic energy as compared to the measurements of Mechlińska-Drewko et al.
In this case, where the neural network was provided with both
[56] and Takeuchi et al.
conﬂicting sets of pure NO measurements, the reﬁned ﬁt is seen here to be more consistent with
the measurements of Takeuchi et al. [33] over those of Mechlińska-Drewko et al. [56].

5.2. Transport calculations for pure NO

In Fig. 13, we apply our multi-term Boltzmann solver to our reﬁned cross section set, in order to
determine a variety of transport coeﬃcients for electrons in NO at T = 300 K over a large range of
reduced electric ﬁelds, E/n0, varying from 3 × 10−3 Td to 104 Td. We ﬁnd that at least an eight-
term approximation is necessary for all the considered NO transport coeﬃcients to be accurate to
within 1%. Fig. 13(a) shows a plot of mean electron energy alongside that for the background NO.
In the low-ﬁeld regime, the mean electron energy is ∼ 146 meV, which is substantially higher than
the thermal background of 3
2 kBT ≈ 38.8 meV, a consequence of the attachment heating resulting
from the reﬁned DEA cross section in Fig. 3(b). As E/n0 is increased, the onset of the vibrational
excitation channels contributes to a net cooling of the electrons, causing the mean electron energy to
reach a minimum of ∼ 116 meV at ∼ 0.17 Td. Beyond that point, increasing E/n0 further causes

data base, compared to swarm measurements from the literature. (b) Corresponding percentage

the mean electron energy to increase monotonically due to heating by the ﬁeld, with its ascent
occasionally slowing due to the onset of additional excitation channels (∼ 1 Td) and attachment and
ionisation processes (∼ 200 Td). Fig. 13(b) shows the rate coeﬃcients for quasielastic momentum
transfer, summed discrete excitation, ionisation and attachment. The quasielastic momentum
transfer rate coeﬃcient is highly correlated with the mean electron energy, although this correlation
tapers oﬀ near 104 Td with a decrease with increasing E/n0. Summed excitation and ionisation rate
coeﬃcients both increase as expected with increasing E/n0. The summed attachment coeﬃcient
also behaves as expected, with the low-energy and high-energy attachment cross sections resulting
in separate maxima at ∼ 0.19 Td and ∼ 250 Td, respectively. Fig. 13(c) shows the bulk (centre-
of-mass) and ﬂux drift velocities of the swarm, which are expected to diﬀer when nonconservative
processes are acting. For example, in the low-ﬁeld regime, the preferential attachment of lower-

energy electrons towards the back of the swarm results in a forward shift in the centre of mass,
yielding a bulk drift velocity that is larger compared to its ﬂux counterpart. Here, the bulk drift
velocity also exhibits NDC between ∼ 3.5 × 10−2 Td and ∼ 5.5 × 10−2 Td. At intermediate ﬁelds,
between ∼ 1 Td and ∼ 100 Td, net nonconservative eﬀects are suﬃciently small such that the
bulk and ﬂux drift velocities coincide. Above ∼ 100 Td, the bulk drift velocity again exceeds the
ﬂux, this time due to ionisation preferentially creating electrons at the front of the swarm. Fig.
13(d) shows the bulk and ﬂux diﬀusion coeﬃcients in directions both longitudinal and transverse
to the ﬁeld. At very low E/n0, when the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is nearly
Maxwellian, the preferential attachment of low-energy electrons removes electrons from the centre
of the swarm over those from the edges, causing an eﬀective increase in the bulk diﬀusion coeﬃcients
compared to their ﬂux counterparts. This remains the case transversely as E/n0 increases due to

the symmetry of the swarm in the transverse direction. Longitudinally, however, the additional
power input by the ﬁeld causes faster, higher energy, electrons to congregate at the front of the
swarm, thus introducing an asymmetry in the longitudinal direction. The subsequent attachment
of lower-energy electrons at the back of the swarm causes the bulk longitudinal diﬀusion coeﬃcient
to drop below its ﬂux counterpart from ∼ 1.2 × 10−2 Td, onward. As with the drift velocities, for
intermediate E/n0 between roughly 1 Td and 100 Td, nonconservative eﬀects are minimal and the
bulk and ﬂux diﬀusion coeﬃcients coincide. At higher E/n0, above 100 Td, there is a signiﬁcant
increase in bulk diﬀusion compared to ﬂux in both the transverse and longitudinal directions, which
we attribute to the preferential production of electrons due to ionisation at the front and sides of
the swarm.

6. Conclusion

We have formed a comprehensive and self-consistent set of electron-NO cross sections, by
constructing an initial set from the literature and then reﬁning it using a multi-term Boltzmann
equation analysis of the available swarm transport data.
This reﬁnement was performed
automatically and objectively using a neural network model, Eq. (2), that was trained on cross
sections derived from the LXCat project [23–25], to ensure that the reﬁnements made were physically
plausible.
In summary, by using our initial set as a base, we obtained from the swarm data a
quasielastic MTCS, a DEA cross section and a ND cross section. Compared to our initial set, we
conﬁrmed that our resulting reﬁned cross section database was more consistent with the swarm
data from which it was derived. Lastly, we used our reﬁned set to calculate a variety of transport
coeﬃcients for electrons in NO across a large range of reduced electric ﬁelds. Notably, this revealed

signiﬁcant heating of the swarm above the thermal background due to our reﬁned low-energy
attachment process.

The machine learning methodology we have employed in this work has previously [18] been
shown to produce cross section sets that are comparable to those reﬁned using conventional swarm
analysis, i.e. through manual iterative reﬁnement by an expert. We thus believe that our reﬁned set
of electron-NO cross sections is of a similarly high quality. That said, we do acknowledge there is
still some room for improvement in the present ﬁt and it is thus fortunate that this machine learning
approach makes it straightforward to revisit NO as new swarm data, cross section constraints, or
LXCat training data becomes available. On this note, we highlight that there are presently no
swarm measurements available for the eﬀective ﬁrst Townsend ionisation coeﬃcient. We believe
performing such measurements would be a worthwhile future endeavour, as they would allow one
to quantify the attachment coeﬃcient in the electropositive regime (above ∼ 75 Td) and thus allow
for the possibility of reﬁning the DEA cross section above ∼ 4 eV.

Given the ill-posed nature of the inverse swarm problem, we also acknowledge that our reﬁned
set carries with it some uncertainty. In this sense, an artiﬁcial neural network of the form of Eq.
(2) is not ideal as it does not provide uncertainty quantiﬁcation. In the future, we may address
this by using an appropriate alternative machine learning model [70–75]. We also plan to apply our
data-driven swarm analysis to determine complete and self-consistent cross section sets for other
molecules of biological interest, including water [76].
