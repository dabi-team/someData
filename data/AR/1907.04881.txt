Photoionization calculations of the endofullerene molecule Cl@C60 with an open-shell chlorine
atom are performed in the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) based on a spher-
ical jellium model. Cross sections for atom-fullerene hybrid photoemission studied show the eﬀects
of the hybridization symmetry, the giant plasmon and the molecular cavity. Comparisons with the
results of Ar@C60 provide insights in the role of a shell-closing electron and its inﬂuence on the
dynamics. The results for Cl@C60 are further compared with those of a more stable, lower energy
+. This comparison
conﬁguration that results after a C60 electron transfers to Cl forming Cl−@C60
reveals noticeable diﬀerences in the ionization properties of the antibonding hybrid state while the
bonding hybrid remains nearly unaltered showing a magniﬁcation covering the entire giant plasmon
energy range.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Signiﬁcant success in the synthesis of endofullerene
molecules – systems of an atom or a smaller molecule
incarcerated within the fullerene cage [1] – has spawned
a series of experiments [2–4] using merged beam tech-
niques at Berkeley Advanced Light Source. Experiments
accessed photoionization properties of these materials in
gas phase.
In addition, endofullerenes, being natural
entrapment of atoms, have led to a series of theoreti-
cal studies of the eﬀects of ionizing radiation on these
systems, i.e., photoionization [5, 6]. Such fundamental
spectroscopic knowledge is particularly useful due to a
broad horizon of applied importance of these materials in,
namely, (i) solid state quantum computations [7, 8], (ii)
improving the superconducting ability of materials [9],
(iii) biomedical ﬁelds [10], (iv) contrast-enhancement re-
search for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (v) im-
proving organic photovoltaic devices [11], and even in
(vi) astrophysics [12].

Endofullerenes conﬁning open-shell atoms have poten-
tial applied interests of rather exotic nature [13]. For in-
stance, N@C60 has attracted interest due to its uniquely
long spin relaxation times driven by the conﬁnement [14].
Electron paramagnetic resonance study [15] of P@C60
has shown enhancement in hyperﬁne coupling of the
phosphorous’ unpaired electrons with its nucleus which
is attributed to the admixture of excited states acquiring
angular momentum from the cage. In contrast, the hy-
perﬁne interaction between the positively-charged muon
and the unpaired electrons in the muonium atom in C60,
relative to free muonium, is predicted to diminish from

the conﬁnement [16]. These discoveries render particu-
lar relevance to study open-shell atomic endofullerenes,
including assessing the spectroscopy of their more stable
conﬁgurations resulting from electron transfers to atomic
vacancies.

One unique phenomenon that ubiquitously occurs
across endofullerene systems is the emergence of atom-
fullerene ground state orbital hybridization. This en-
tails the formation of symmetric (bonding) and antisym-
metric (antibonding) hybrid states as the eigenstates of
the whole system from the mixing of an atomic and a
fullerene orbital of identical angular momentum symme-
try. A number of our previous studies has predicted
such hybrid states in various endofullerenes and their
broad spectrum of photoionization properties [17–21]. It
is therefore of particular value to scrutinize the sensitiv-
ity of the hybridization and the photoemission dynamics
of these hybrid states via gentle changes of conﬁguration
features by, for instance, comparing the eﬀects of con-
ﬁnement upon successive atoms in the periodic table.

A prototype case that we examine here is the hybrid
level photoionization of Cl@C60 versus Ar@C60; Cl has
just one electron less than Ar in the outer 3p shell and
an atomic number lower by one. Closed-shell Ar, being
chemically inert, almost certainly locates at the center of
the spherical C60. We treat the barely open-shell Cl also
within the spherical geometry so as to retain the same
spherical calculation as was done for the Ar case. We
+ produced by the
then consider a system of Cl−@C60
transfer of a C60 electron to ﬁll in the Cl hole. This con-
ﬁguration attains lower energy forming closed-shell Cl−.
There has been experimental evidence, based on laser
desorption mass spectroscopy, of C60 with a single Cl−
inside [22]. While it is expected that the polarization in-
teraction of the ion can induce some oﬀset in its position
from the center of C60, a density functional theory calcu-
lation with Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics indi-

 
 
 
 
 
 
cates that this oﬀset is quite small within neutral C60[23].

Therefore, we treat Cl−@C60
etry as well. We then compare the hybrid photoionization
of this new conﬁguration with Cl@C60. Ultimately, the
general comparison among these three endofullerene sys-
tems unfolds the delicate dependence of the hybridization
and resulting photoionization cross sections on a shell-
closing electron as well as on an electron transfer from
the cage to the atom.

II. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THEORY

The details of the theory are described in Ref. [18].
Choosing the photon polarization along the z-axis, the
photoionization dipole transition cross section in a frame-
work of time-dependent local density approximation
(TDLDA) is given by

Here k is the momentum of the continuum electron, z is
the one-body dipole operator, φnl is the single electron
bound wavefunction of the target level, and ψkl′ is the
respective outgoing dipole-allowed continuum wavefunc-
tion, with l′ = l
1. δV represents the complex induced
potential that accounts for electron correlations within
the linear response framework.

We model the bound and continuum states self-
consistently using the independent particle LDA method.
The jellium potentials, Vjel(r), representing 60 C4+ ions
for C60 is constructed by smearing the total positive
charge over a spherical shell with known molecular radius
R = 3.54˚A [24] and thickness ∆. A constant pseudopo-
tential v is added to the jellium for quantitative accuracy.
The Kohn-Sham equations for the system of 240 electrons
(four valence (2s22p2) electrons from each carbon atom),
plus all electrons of the central atom with atomic number
ζ, are then solved in the LDA potential

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Cl@C60 versus Ar@C60

1. Ground State Atom-C60 Hybridization

to obtain the bound and continuum orbitals in Eq. (1).
Eq. (2) uses the Leeuwen-Baerends (LB) exchange-
correlation functional VXC [25], which provides an ac-
curate asymptotic description of the ground state poten-
tial. The parameters v and ∆ are determined by re-
quiring both charge neutrality and obtaining the experi-
mental value [26] of the ﬁrst ionization threshold of C60.
The values of ∆ = 1.3˚A thus obtained closely agree with
that extracted from measurements [24]. We remark that
treating an open-shell Cl atom in the spherical model is
an approximation. For instance, our calculation overesti-
mates Cl ionization energy from NIST data database [27]
by about 7%. But this should not take away much from
the main message of this paper, particularly given that
+ is included
a more likely stable conﬁguration Cl−@C60
in this study which contains a closed-shell Cl−.

In an endofullerene system, an eigenstate of the free
atomic hamiltonian can admix with an eigenstate of the
empty C60 hamiltonian of the same angular momentum
symmetry to produce hybrid states which are eigenstates
of the combined system. Thus, ground state LDA results
for Cl@C60 reveal hybridization between 3pCl and 3pC60
states which jointly produce symmetrically and antisym-
metrically combined states of Cl@C60 that can be written
as,

of these wavefunctions are shown and compared with the
corresponding hybrid wavefunctions of Ar@C60. From a
perturbation theory viewpoint, the strength of this mix-
ing is proportional directly to the overlap of the partic-
ipating (free) orbitals and inversely to the separation of
their binding energies. As Fig. 1 indicates, the energy
of 3pAr is extremely close to that of 3pC60, while 3pCl
moves a bit higher, leading to a stronger mixing with a
value of α (Eq. (7)) close to about 0.5 (equal share of
atom-fullerene character) for Ar@C60. A somewhat re-
duced hybridization in Cl@C60 with a greater value of α
thus implies enhanced Cl and enhanced C60 characters,
respectively, for the symmetric and antisymmetric state.
This occurs in spite of a slightly increased wavefunction
overlap due to a small displacement of 3pCl wavefunc-
tion toward the shell from that of 3pAr (Fig. 1). Also
note that the resulting symmetric hybrids of the systems
are more separated energetically than the antisymmetric
hybrids.

sented in Fig. 2 as a function of the photon energy. Com-
paring these with 3p of free Cl and Ar indicates plasmon
driven enhancements at low energies [20, 29]. This en-
hancement is signiﬁcantly stronger for symmetric photoe-
mission than the antisymmetric one. In the framework
of interchannel coupling due to Fano, the correlation-
modiﬁed (TDLDA) matrix element of the photoioniza-

Evidently, the enhancement of the symmetric state cross
section, Eq. (12a), involving the sum of real and imagi-
nary components, will be universally larger than that of
the antisymmetric state which include their diﬀerences.
Indeed, this is seen for both Cl@C60 and Ar@C60 in Fig. 2
and a direct consequence of the in-phase versus out-of-
phase radial oscillation of the hybrid wavefunctions at
C60 shell (Fig. 1). However, the detailed similarities and
diﬀerences of enhanced cross section between two systems
must depend on their respective values of α in a rather
complicated way that involves the interferences between
the atomic and the C60 components of the matrix ele-
ments in Eq. (12). We note that while this enhancement
is of a comparable size for the symmetric states of both
systems in Fig. 2(a), it is signiﬁcantly weaker for anti-
symmetric Cl-C60 compared to Ar-C60 [Fig 2(b)]. The
situation further complicates from the eﬀect of lowering
binding energies of Cl@C60 hybrid levels as is discussed
in subsection IIIB below.

As the plasmonic eﬀect weakens with increasing en-
ergy, the cross sections largely follow their free atom
curves, as seen in Fig. 2. Cooper minimum-like struc-
tures develop [30] around 50 eV on both the symmetric
curves with the minimum of Cl@C60 being deeper due to
its higher atomic character. Note that the Cooper min-
ima in 3p cross sections for free atoms are clearly visible
in Fig. 2. In any case, such minima also show up around
60 eV for antisymmetric emissions where the structure
for Cl@C60 is very weak because of its weaker atomic
character.

Above these energies the cross sections oscillate as
a consequence of a well-known multipath interference
mechanism [31] due to the cavity structure of C60 which
was modeled earlier [32]. At such high energies the inter-
channel coupling in Eq. (8) vanishes to simplify Eqs. (11)

is the contribution from the atomic region, the second
term denotes the reﬂection induced oscillations in mo-
mentum coordinates with amplitude Arefl and frequencies
related to Di and Do, the inner and outer diameters of
the shell. Since, obviously, Arefl is proportional to
atom,
the larger the atomic component of a hybrid wavefunc-
tion, the stronger is the reﬂection and the higher is the
chances that the oscillations occur about the free atom
result. This is exactly what is seen for the high energy
cross section of Cl+C60 in Fig. 2(a). On the other hand,
Eq. (14b) presents the portion of the overlap integral
from the shell region, producing two collateral emissions
from shell edges, which oscillate in frequencies related to
Ri and Ro. This part will dominate if a hybrid level has a
stronger C60 character, like for Cl-C60, which intensiﬁes
oscillations at higher energies but falls signiﬁcantly lower
than free 3pCl [Fig. 2(b)]. For the Ar@C60 hybrids, how-
ever, due to their almost equal share of atom-C60 charac-
ter (Fig. 1), the strength of high-energy cross sections are
comparable, somewhat below 3pAr, but the diﬀerences in
the details of their shapes again owe to the interference
between reﬂective and collateral emissions.

A reactive Cl atom is very likely to capture an elec-

wavefunctions of all pure fullerene states are found inde-
pendent of which C60 orbital the hole is situated at. In
fact, these energies and wavefunctions remain practically
identical to those of empty C60, and therefore of little
interest. However, the hybridization between 3pCl− and
+ is somewhat modiﬁed from that in Cl@C60, or, in
3pC60
other words, between after and before the electron makes
a transition, as we describe below. Yet it is found that

our results presented here are robust being free of a spe-
ciﬁc choice of the hole level. On the other hand, since

radially outward than 3pCl to increase its overlap with

war between these two eﬀects, the former wins result-

ing in some modiﬁcation of hybridization for Cl−@C60
conﬁguration as displayed in Fig. 3. It is seen that the
atomic character stays unchanged, but the C60 character
weakens at the shell for the symmetric hybrid, while the
reverse is true for the antisymmetric hybrid. Compar-
ing the energy of the hybrid levels, the symmetric hybrid
moves energetically higher [Fig. 3(a)] while the antisym-
metric hybrids barely separate [Fig. 3(b)] as a result of
the charge transfer. And this modiﬁed hybridization af-
fects the resulting photoionization cross sections.

To be more precise, some reduction in the intensity of

shell region results in little eﬀect on the cross section. In
the energy region of the plasmon, this can be understood
in general from the interchannel coupling contribution
of the matrix element in Eq. (8). Speciﬁcally, this term
in part embodies the overlaps of the “fractional” ion-
ization channel emanating from the shell region of the
symmetric hybrid with all C60 channels which are ac-
3pC60 in Eq. (12a). The channel overlap
counted for in
includes both the overlap between the bound and the
continuum wavefunctions. While the reduction of the
+ radial wave noted above lowers
structure in Cl−+C60
the aggregated strength of bound overlaps, the contin-
uum overlaps will be slightly favored due to the following
reason. A continuum overlap is more eﬃcient at higher
photoelectron momenta k, since diﬀerences between the
momenta due to diﬀerent level energies reduce enabling
the continuum waves to oscillate progressively in phase
+ state opening
with each other. Therefore, the Cl−+C60
at a lower photon energy beneﬁts continuum overlaps to

cause its net increase. This gain must be compensating
the loss due to weakening hybridization to aﬀect practi-
cally no change in the symmetric hybrid level cross sec-
tion [Fig. 4(a)] after the electron transfers. Note that the
3pX in Eq. (12a) has no eﬀect here due to about
term
the same atomic character of hybrid wavefunctions be-
fore and after the electron switches locations. For the
higher energy emission of this hybrid [Fig. 4(a)], a rather
miniscule weakening of the multipath oscillations follow-
ing the electron transfer traces to the reduction of its
C60 character that slightly reduces the collateral emis-
sion in Eq. (14), while keeping the reﬂective emission
unchanged. The strong atomic character of this hybrid,
which remains unchanged in spite of the electron tran-
sition, keeps the average strength of both cross sections
close to 3p of Cl and Cl− which are practically equal at
these energies.

Diﬀerences between the cross sections of asymmet-
+ and Cl@C60, shown in
ric hybrid states of Cl−@C60
Fig. 4(b), are rather strong. The diﬀerences at plasmonic
energies up to 40 eV are due to the reduction of the
atomic character [Fig. 3(b)], particularly via the interfer-
ence eﬀects illustrated in Eq. (12b). Note that since the
binding energies of this hybrid state suﬀer a very little
change upon the charge transfer, the continuum overlap
eﬀect described above does not apply. However, at higher
energies, 80 eV and above, the diﬀerence in cross sections
grows progressively stronger. This must be due a cumu-
lative eﬀect of the reduction of the atomic component of
direct ionization, as a result of the reduced atomic char-
+, the subsequent reduction of reﬂec-
acter in Cl−-C60
tive amplitude in Eq. (14), and the interference between
them. To this end, even after the molecule evolves to
+, the strong plasmonic
a stable conﬁguration Cl−@C60
magniﬁcation of the emission from the symmetric hybrid
remains, but the high energy response of the asymmetric
state substantially changes.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

6

Using a fairly successful methodology of the time-
dependent local density approximation based on a spher-
ical jellium modeling of C60’s ion core, we compute the
photoemission cross sections of the atom-fullerene hy-
brid levels of Cl@C60. A comparison of the results with
those of Ar@C60 probes the modiﬁcation eﬀects of a
shell-closing electron on the properties of these hybrid
photoemissions. However, Cl@C60 must be an unstable
system and will likely induce an electron transfer from
C60 to Cl to reach a more stable and lower energy con-
ﬁguration. We compared the results between these two
conﬁgurations of Cl endofullerenes to assess the eﬀects
of this electron transition on the hybrid photodynam-
ics. Tuning the conﬁguration gently along the sequence
+, a systematic evolu-
of Ar@C60 to Cl@C60 to Cl−@C60
tion of the ionizing response properties of hybrid states
is uncovered. This is the ﬁrst study of the photoioniza-
tion properties of a halogen endofullerene to the best of
our knowledge. A strong magniﬁcation of the low en-
ergy emission of the symmetric hybrid over the entire
giant plasmon resonance region and an enhanced multi-
path interference eﬀects for the high energy antisymmet-
ric hybrid are found to be the most robust features in our
study.
