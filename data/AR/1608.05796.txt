Abstract

In this paper, we present a study of an M2.2 class solar ﬂare of 26 November
2000 from NOAA AR 9236. The ﬂare was well observed by various ground
based observatories (ARIES, Learmonths Solar Observatory) and space borne
instruments (SOHO, HXRS, GOES) in time interval between 02:30 UT to 04:00
UT. The ﬂare started with long arc-shape outer ﬂare ribbon. Afterwards the
main ﬂare starts with two main ribbons.
Initially the outer ribbons start to
expand with an average speed (∼ 20 km s−1) and later it shows contraction.
The ﬂare was associated with partial halo coronal mass ejection (CMEs) which
has average speed of 495 km s−1. The SOHO/MDI observations show that the
active region was in quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration. The ﬂux cancellation
was observed before the ﬂare onset close to ﬂare site. Our analysis indicate the
ﬂare was initiated by the magnetic breakout mechanism.

all layers of the solar atmosphere, heating plasma to tens of millions of Kelvin
and accelerating electrons, protons (Gopalswamy et al., 2004; Chandra et al.,
2013). They produce radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum
i.e.
from radio waves to gamma rays. Major goals of solar ﬂare research is
to determine the origin and evolution of the energetic electrons accelerated
during impulsive phase of the solar ﬂares. These particles are most directly
observable through their gyro-synchrotron radiations at microwave (MW) fre-
quencies and emission of hard X-ray (HXR) through collisional bremsstrahlung
(Holman et al., 1984).

It is now widely accepted that solar ﬂares are produced by the release of
energy stored in the stressed magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetic reconnection is mainly
responsible for this energy release. Continuous ﬂux emergence in the active re-
gion is one of the main indicator for the stressed magnetic ﬁeld, whereas the ﬂux
cancellation can tell about the reconnection. The magnetic ﬂux may already be
twisted while emerging in the photosphere. The photospheric motion of mag-
netic polarities are the drivers of the free energy storage and the emerging ﬂux
would provide the trigger mechanism for the impulsive energy release. Therefore
magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation are very important to understand the
causes of ﬂare initiation.

The release energy during solar ﬂares produces accelerated electrons and
ions, which interact with the ambient solar atmosphere. High temporal res-
olution observations are very important to investigate the time evolution of
solar ﬂares. This allow us to study the diﬀerent phases of ﬂare evolution viz.
impulsive, main and gradual phase. Therefore, analysis of multi-wavelength
data with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for understanding
the acceleration and propagation of particles during solar ﬂares (for exam-
ple see Aulanier et al. (2000); Galsgaard et al. (2000); Fletcher et al. (2001);
Chandra et al. (2006, 2013) and references therein).

It is now established that ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are pre-
dominantly magnetic explosions and they show rapid motion and heating that
infer to be driven by magnetic energy locally contained in the magnetic ﬁeld
(Svestka et al., 1976; Sturrock, 1980). All CMEs and many ﬂares exhibit out-
ward mass motion, even though it is likely that part of the magnetic ﬁeld must
shrink (implode) in order that there be an overall decrease in magnetic energy
in the region of the explosion (Hudson, 2000). The origins of CMEs were earlier
investigated by Verma & Pande (1989) and Verma (1992, 2002) and suggested
that the CME events are perhaps produced by some mechanism, in which the
mass ejected by some solar ﬂares or active prominences, gets connected with
the open magnetic lines of CHs (coronal holes: source of high speed solar wind
streams) and moves along them to appear as CMEs.

To explain the diﬀerent observational features of solar ﬂares and associated
phenomena, the CSHKP model was proposed (Carmichael, 1964; Sturrock, 1966;
Hirayama, 1974; Kopp & Pneuman, 1976). This model explains the ﬁlament
eruptions, ﬂare ribbon formation and their separation. The CSHKP model
is two-dimensional. Recently Aulanier et al. (2013) and Janvier et al. (2013)
extend the 2D CSHKP model into 3D using MHD simulations and compare

2

the numerical results with high resolution Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
observations. However, these models are not to explain the trigger mechanism
of solar eruptions.

To understand the trigger mechanism of solar eruptions several models have
been put forward. These models includes: Magnetic breakout (Antiochos et al.,
1999), Tether cutting (Moore et al., 2001), kink instability (T¨or¨ok et al., 2004),
ideal MHD instability (torus instability) (Forbes & Isenberg, 1991; Kliem & T¨or¨ok,
2006). However, it is still not settled which model initiates the solar eruptions.
Therefore, to understand the solar eruptions trigger mechanism is still major
problem in solar physics.

Here, we discuss about the “magnetic breakout” model, because it appears
to be favorable mechanism for our studied event. According to this model,
the eruption is triggered at the magnetic null–point high in the corona in a
quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration. If the magnetic arcade starts to rise due
to shear in magnetic ﬁeld, its expansion results in the formation of a current
sheet and reconnection at null–point. Due to the reconnection, the magnetic
tension decreased continuously and as a result the eruption starts.

Several studies have been done on the observational evidence of magnetic
breakout model (Aulanier et al. (2000); Mandrini et al. (2006); Joshi et al. (2007);
Chandra et al. (2011); Aurass et al. (2011); Reeves et al. (2015); Chen et al.
(2016) and references cited therein). Let us discuss these studies in brief.
Aulanier et al. (2000) did the detailed analysis of Bastille day ﬂare of 14 July,
1998 and concluded the eruption was due to the magnetic breakout. With
the help of magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations, they found the presence of a null
point in the corona. Mandrini et al. (2006) studied the precursor phase of X17
ﬂare on 28 October, 2003. They have reported a precursor event in Hα and
TRACE images in a large-scale quadrupolar reconnection and concluded that
this precursor contributes to decrease magnetic tension and allows the ﬁlament
to erupt in a way similar to breakout model. However, they showed that the
magnetic reconnection occurs in Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) instead of null
point. Chandra et al. (2011) also presented the evidence of magnetic break-
out mechanism in the ﬂare of 20 November, 2003 without the null-point topol-
ogy. Joshi et al. (2007) and Aurass et al. (2011) shows the evidence of magnetic
breakout on the basis of radio observations. Very recently Chen et al. (2016)
presented the observations of imaging of magnetic breakout using the high res-
olution SDO data and found the breakout reconnection sets around 40 min
before the main ﬂare onset. From the above discussion on magnetic breakout
mechanism, it is still not clear when and where the eruption is triggered in this
mechanism. Hence, it needs further investigation.

Therefore to shed light on the above discussed problems, in this present pa-
per, we have investigated an M2.2 solar ﬂare and CMEs observed on 26 Novem-
ber, 2000 from NOAA AR 9236 in view of multi-wavelength observations. In
section 2, we mentioned about observational data sources and an overview of
active region. The results are presented in Section 3 and conclusion is given in
section 4.

2. Observations and overview of the active region NOAA 9236

The active region, NOAA AR 9236 was one of the most ﬂare productive ac-
tive region in the peak phase of solar cycle 23. The active region appeared in the
east limb on 18 November, 2000 as β magnetic conﬁguration and went over the
west limb on 30 November, 2000. The magnetic conﬁguration of active region
becomes βγ on 23 November, 2000. During the disk passage the active region
produced 40 C–class, 06 M–class, 10 X–class GOES X–ray ﬂares. Many ﬂares
from this active region were studied by several authors (Nitta & Hudson, 2001;
Wang et al., 2002; Moon et al., 2003; Takasaki et al., 2004). In these studies,
it was reported that the active region was characterized by continuous mag-
netic ﬂux emergence in the penumbral area sunspot. According to Wang et al.
(2002), the ﬂux emerged in the active region between 23 to 25 November, 2000.
Afterwards the ﬂux emergence stops.

On 2000 November 26, we observed an M2.2 class GOES ﬂare /optical class
1F ﬂare in Hα from ARIES, Nainital in this active region. The active region
was located on solar disk at N22W34 on that day. The ﬂare impulsive phase
starts around 02:47 UT, peaked at 03:08 UT, and ended around 03:20 UT.

In order to know the magnetic causes of the ﬂare, we have presented the mag-
netic ﬁled images before the ﬂare onset in Figure 1. In the ﬁgure the top image
shows the extended view of active region. The active region is in quadrupolar
magnetic conﬁguration. The negative/positive polarities of the quadrupole is
shown by N1N2/P1P2 and enclosed by white and black contours respectively.
The enlarged view of the active region shown by square in the top image is
shown in the middle and bottom panel of the ﬁgure. We have circled the area of
ﬂare location. Looking at these circled regions, we noticed the signiﬁcant ﬂux
cancellation before the onset of M2.2 class ﬂare.

The observational data used in this study is taken from the following instru-

ments:

• Hα Data: For the current study we used the Hα data observed from
ARIES (formerly State Observatory), Nainital, India with 15 cm f/15
Coud´e–refractor telescope. The telescope was equipped with high speed
CCD camera developed for observations of solar ﬂares, which is capable to
record ﬂare image at time interval of 25 ms. Details of the CCD camera
system is described by Verma (1999). The resolution of images are 0.65
arcsec. The cadence of images during the observations was from one to
ten sec during the ﬂare observation.

• X-ray and Radio Data: To understand the thermal and non-thermal
nature of the ﬂare, we use the X- ray data from the Czech-made Hard X-
Ray Spectrometer (HXRS) instrument on board the Multispectral Ther-
mal Imager (MTI) satellite (F´arn´ık et al., 2001).
In addition of these
data, we have used the radio data of diﬀerent frequencies observed from
Learmonth Solar Observatory.

• SOHO/MDI and SOHO/EIT Data: In order to study the magnetic
complexity of the active region, we have used the data from Michelson

4

Doppler Imager (MDI) (Scherrer et al., 1995) onboard Solar and Helio-
spheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite. The cadence and the pixel size of
the images are 96 min and 1.98 arcsec respectively. We have also used
the SOHO/EIT Fe XII (195 ˚A) data (Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995). The
cadence of EIT data was 12 min, and the pixel resolution was 2.5 arcsec.

• LASCO CME Data: For the associated CME with the studied ﬂare,
we used the data from Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO;
Brueckner et al. (1995)) C2 data.

3. Analysis and Results

To understand the multi-wavelength spatial and temporal characteristics of
the ﬂare, in this section, the evolution of the ﬂare observed in Hα, radio, X-ray
and EUV wavebands is presented.

3.1. Spatial Evolutions

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the M2.2/1F class ﬂare in Hα. One diﬀerence
between our studied event here and other previous ﬂare from this active region
is that, most of the previous observed ﬂares were initiated by ﬁlament eruption.
In contrary to that the ﬂare of 26 November, 2000 was not associated with any
ﬁlament eruption. However, this ﬂare looks homologous to the other ﬂares of this
active region. Similar to other homologous ﬂare, this ﬂare was also associated
with partial halo CME. The description about the associated CME is discussed
in subsection 3.3.

The ﬂare was initiated with arc–shaped ribbon R1 around 02:48 UT. The
ribbon R1 has two parts eastern ( R1′ ) and western ( R1 ). The eastern fainter
ribbon R1′ faded quickly. We track the evolution of western ribbon R1 and
found, initially the north portion of ribbon was moving towards west with a
speed of ∼ 20 km s−1. As the time progress the same part of the ribbon shows
contraction. The north part of the ribbon R1 faded; while as the south part
was bright till the end of the main ﬂare. This ribbon was located in the positive
polarity region (see ﬁgure 3). Such arc–shaped type ribbons were observed in
all the ﬂares produced by this active region (Wang et al., 2002; Takasaki et al.,
2004). Wang et al. (2002) interpret these arc–shaped ribbons as a results of
the interaction between erupting ﬂux rope and the overlaying loops. Wang
(2005) also found the expansion-to-contraction motion in the outer ribbon of 25
November, 2000 ﬂare event from the same active region. As proposed by Wang
(2005), this contraction motion can be interpreted as a result of the falling back
of part of erupting ﬂux rope. Such arc–shaped ribbons was also reported in
Chandra et al. (2009).

The ﬁrst appearance of arc–shaped ribbon R1 indicates weak reconnection
ﬁrst and as a result of this the ribbon R1 appears. After the weak reconnection,
it might weakend the magnetic tension. Afterwards the main ﬂare occur. This
could be a signature of the magnetic breakout model as discussed in the intro-
duction section. For the magnetic breakout trigger mechanism, the quadrupolar

5

conﬁguration is a necessary condition. If we look at our active region, it has
also quadrupolar structure (see ﬁgure 1).

According to magnetic breakout model proposed by Antiochos et al. (1999),
the reconnection start to occur above the erupting arcade and not much energy
is released during this reconnection. The reason is that most of the free energy
is stored in the low laying arcade. Due to the weak reconnection, we might
observed the arc–shaped outer ribbon in one of the positive polarity ‘P2’ of
quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration (see ﬁgure 1, upper panel). The appearance
of outer ribbon before the main ﬂare is an important implication of the breakout
model. Hence, we believe that the quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration together
with the ﬁrst appearances of arc–shaped ribbon R1 strengthen our idea that the
ﬂare was triggered by magnetic breakout mechanism.

Quickly after the appearance of arc–shaped ribbon R1, main ﬂare ribbons
R2 and R3 start to brighten. The main ﬂare ribbons can be seen up to 03:30
UT. As the time progresses these main ﬂare ribbons show the sign of separation
as excepted in CSHKP ﬂare model. To locate the location of polarity of ﬂare
ribbons in Figure 3 (top, left panel), the contours of ﬂare ribbons are plotted
over magnetogram. The overplot shows that the main ﬂare ribbon R2 and R3
are located in the positive and negative polarities respectively.

Figure 3 also presented (top right, bottom (left,right)) the SOHO/EIT 195 ˚A
images at ﬂare onset and during the ﬂare maximum phase. Figure 3 (bottom,
left) shows the SOHO/EIT image overlaid by MDI magnetic ﬁeld contours. The
black and white contours represent the negative and positive polarity respec-
tively. In the bottom, right image, we can see the loops joining the ribbon R1
R2 and R2 R3. These loops indicate the connectivity after the ﬂare. Evolution
of main ﬂare ribbons R1 and R2 shows several kernels inside the ribbons. The
temporal evolution of some of the selected kernels is presented in next subsec-
tion.

3.2. Temporal Evolutions

To study the temporal association of observed ﬂare among diﬀerent wave-
lengths, in this section, we have presented the intensity evolution of ﬂare as
a function of time observed in Hα, soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and radio wave-
lengths. As mentioned in previous subsection, during the evolution of the ﬂare
in Hα, we can see several kernels. we have selected three kernels, as shown in
Figure 2 at 3:11:25 UT. We name them K1, K2 and K3 respectively. For the
computation of ﬂare kernel intensity, we have created a box of 10 ×10 pixels
around the kernels and calculate the average intensity inside it. Afterwards
the average intensity is normalized by the background intensity. For the back-
ground intensity we have selected a box of 100×100 pixels in the quiet region.
Among the selected kernels K1, and K3 are strong. Therefore for the temporal
evolution, we have plotted only the kernel K1 and K3.

In the panel I, II and III of Figure 4, we have plotted the GOES X-ray at
two wavelengths, GOES X-ray time derivative and HXRS hard X-rays, data re-
spectively. The Hα kernels are displayed in IV, V of the ﬁgure, whileas VI panel
presents the radio observations at frequencies 1415 MHz, 2695 MHz, 4995 MHz,

6

8800 MHz and 15400 observed from Learmonth Solar Observatory, Learmonth,
Australia.

The impulsive phase of ﬂare (between 02:50 to 02:58 UT) was observed by
HXRS at diﬀerent energy channels. The impulsive phase of X-ray peaks around
02:54 UT. Unfortunately, the HXRS X-ray observations was not available during
the peak phase of ﬂare. According to Neupart eﬀect the time derivative of soft
X-ray should correlate with the Hard X-rays. Therefore, to ﬁll the gap of HXRS
observation, We have taken GOES time derivative as a proxy of Hard X-rays.
The time derivative of the GOES X-rays is shown in ﬁgure 4 (second panel).
We have noticed the GOES time derivative is peaked earlier (∼ 4 min) then the
GOES soft X-ray and Hα. This suggests that the acceleration of non-thermal
electrons was involved in the heating of lower chromosphere.

Looking at the radio proﬁles, we noticed two peak: the ﬁrst peak was associ-
ated with HXRS peaks, whereas the second peak was associated with main ﬂare
phase observed in Hα and GOES SXR. The temporal correlation between the
ﬁrst radio peaks and HXR peaks indicate that the same population of electrons
are responsible for the HXR and radio emissions.

If we compare the onset of X-rays, radio ﬂux and the appearance of ﬂare
ribbon R1. They are temporally associated. This indicate that the before the
main phase of ﬂare, there is a weak reconnection, which triggers the main ﬂare.
This is the evidence of ﬂare trigger due to magnetic breakout mechanism. The
description about the ribbon R1 is discussed in subsection 3.1.

3.3. CME Observations

The solar ﬂare observed on 2000 November 26 at 02:27 UT was accompanied
by partial CME (width ∼ 259 deg) as observed by the LASCO instrument. The
CME appear ﬁrst in LASCO C2 ﬁeld-of-view at 03:30 UT in the north-west
direction. The evolution of LASCO C2 CME is displayed in Figure 5. The linear
velocity of CMEs is 495 km s−1. The acceleration corresponding to CMEs was
-22.9 ms−2.

4. Conclusions

In this study, we have presented the high cadence CCD observations of an
M2.2 class solar ﬂare in Hα emissions on 2000 November, 26 from NOAA AR
9236. The ground based Hα was combined with radio observations and with
various space borne instruments (SOHO, HXRS, GOES).

The ﬂare started with long arc-shape outer R1 ribbons. Afterwards the main
ﬂare starts with two ribbons. Initially the outer ribbons start to expand with
average speed of 20 km s−1 and lateron it shows contraction. The ﬁrst appear-
ance of outer ﬂare ribbons and quadrupolar magnetic conﬁguration of active
region shows that the ﬂare was initiated by the magnetic breakout mechanism
(Antiochos et al., 1999). The appearance of X-ray and radio emission ﬂux be-
fore the main ﬂare also conﬁrm that the ﬂare is triggered by magnetic breakout
mechanism.

7

The SOHO/MDI observations shows emergence of positive and negative
magnetic polarities around the main positive polarity, which might makes this
active region more ﬂare productive. The cancellation of magnetic ﬂux close to
the ﬂare site before the studied M2.2 class ﬂare could provide the evidence that
that ﬂux cancellation is responsible for the ﬂare.
