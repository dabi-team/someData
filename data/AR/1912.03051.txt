A model-potential method is employed to calculate binding, elastic scattering, and annihilation of positrons
for a number of atoms and small nonpolar molecules, namely, Be, Mg, He, Ar, H2, N2, Cl2, and CH4. The model
potential contains one free parameter for each type of atom within the target. Its values are chosen to reproduce
existing ab initio positron-atom binding energies or scattering phase shifts. The calculations are performed
using a Gaussian basis for the positron states, and we show how to obtain values of the scattering phase shifts
and normalized annihilation rate Zeﬀ from discrete positive-energy pseudostates. Good agreement between the
present results and existing calculations and experimental data, where available, is obtained, including the Zeﬀ
value for CH4, which is strongly enhanced by a low-lying virtual positron state. An exception is the room-
temperature value of Zeﬀ for Cl2, for which the present value is much smaller than the experimental value
obtained over 50 years ago. Our calculations predict that among the molecular targets studied, only Cl2 might
support a bound state for the positron, with a binding energy of a few meV.

INTRODUCTION

We have recently proposed a model-potential approach that
enables one to calculate the energies and annihilation rates for
positron bound states with molecules, including large alkanes
[1, 2]. In this paper we show that the method can also be used
to describe low-energy positron scattering and annihilation in
small nonpolar molecules. We also validate it by performing
binding, scattering, and annihilation calculations for a num-
ber of atoms for which accurate theoretical predictions are
available.

The positron (e+) is an important tool in many areas of
science, e.g., in tests of QED and the standard model [3–5],
astrophysics [6], condensed-matter physics [7], and in medical
imaging [8]. However, the basic interactions of positrons with
ordinary matter are still not fully understood. In particular,
this concerns the problem of low-energy positron annihilation
in molecules and its resonant enhancement, and the related
problem of positron binding to neutral atoms and molecules.
The ability of certain neutral atoms to support bound states
for positrons was suggested by many-body-theory calculations
in 1995 [9] and rigorously proved by variational calculations of
the e+Li binding energy two years later [10, 11]. A plethora of
calculations for other atoms followed (see Ref. [12] for a 2002
review), and it is now expected that about 50 atoms in their
ground states can bind a positron [13]. Unfortunately, positron-
atom bound states have not yet been observed experimentally,
though several detection schemes have been proposed [14–17].
Conversely, positron binding energies have been determined
experimentally for about 85 polyatomic molecules [18–27].
This has been done by making use of resonant annihilation.
When a positron collides with a molecule, it can annihilate
with a target electron “in ﬂight.” Additionally, for polyatomic
molecules, annihilation can also proceed by capture of the
positron into a bound state, its excess energy being transferred

into excitation of a vibrational mode with near-resonant energy
[28–30]. This results in resonances in the annihilation rate at
positron energies εν = (cid:126)ων − εb, where εb is the positron
binding energy and ων is the vibrational frequency of mode
ν. The binding energy is thus measured as a downshift of the
resonance energy with respect to that of the vibrational mode.
Note that resonant annihilation can occur only for molecules
that support a bound state for the positron [31, 32]. The vast
majority of molecules studied experimentally to date are non-
polar or weakly polar, e.g., alkanes, arenes, alcohols, formates,
and acetates. On the side of theory, calculations of positron-
molecule binding have had limited success. Most studies have
considered strongly polar molecules, i.e., those with a dipole
moment greater than the critical value of 1.625 D that guar-
antees binding even at the static level of theory [33, 34]. (For
molecules that are free to rotate, the critical dipole moment
is greater, and it increases with the molecule’s angular mo-
mentum [35].) In fact, only six species have been studied
both theoretically and experimentally, namely, carbon disul-
ﬁde CS2, acetaldehyde C2H4O, propanal C2H5CHO, acetone
(CH3)2CO, acetonitrile CH3CN, and propionitrile C2H5CN
[36–40]. The best agreement is currently at the level of 25%
for acetonitrile, where a conﬁguration-interaction calculation
gave εb = 135 meV [39], compared to the measured binding
energy of 180 meV [24]. On the other hand, the calculation
found no binding for CS2 [36], while the experiment gives
εb = 75 meV [24]. The calculations are diﬃcult because of
strong electron-positron correlation eﬀects that are hard to
describe in a complete manner ab initio. An overview of cal-
culations of positron-molecule binding carried out to date can
be found in Ref. [1].

Recently, we proposed a model-potential method for calcu-
lating positron-molecule binding energies. In this method, the
electrostatic potential of the molecule is ﬁrst calculated at the
static (Hartree-Fock) level. The Schrödinger equation is then
solved for a positron in this potential, with the addition of a
model potential that accounts for the long-range polarization
of the molecule and short-range correlations [1]. We tested this
idea by examining positron binding to hydrogen cyanide HCN
[1] and obtained good agreement with existing ab initio cal-

culations [41, 42]. However, the true strength of our approach
is that it can be easily applied to large systems. In Ref. [2]
we used it to study positron binding to alkanes with up to 16
carbon atoms. We found good agreement between the calcu-
lated and measured binding energies, and we also computed
the rates of positron annihilation from the bound states.

In our method [1, 2], the positron wave function is expanded
in a basis of square-integrable Gaussian functions. Here we
show that in spite of the absence of true continuum, the method
can be adapted to calculate low-energy positron scattering and
direct annihilation for nonpolar molecules. To test the idea, we
ﬁrst perform calculation for a number of atoms, both positron-
binding (Be and Mg) and nonbinding (He and Ar), where
accurate calculations exist. Our model positron-molecule cor-
relation potential contains just one free parameter (viz., the
cutoﬀ radius) for an atomic target, or one free parameter for
each type of atom within a molecular target. Their values for
Be, Mg, He, Ar, and H are taken from existing model-potential
calculations of positron binding, scattering, and annihilation
with atoms [43], or adjusted to reproduce many-body-theory
scattering phase shifts [44]. Our calculations for molecular
targets, viz., H2, N2, Cl2, and CH4, are more predictive in
nature. Here, we calculate s-wave scattering phase shifts, scat-
tering lengths, and annihilation rates for all species. We also
explore the possibility of positron binding to Cl2 and make
comparisons with existing theoretical and experimental data.

Atomic units (a.u.) are used throughout.

II. THEORY AND NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

A. Schrödinger equation for positron

The details of our model-potential treatment of the positron-
molecule interaction are given in Ref. [1]. Here we brieﬂy
repeat the salient features for convenience.

The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for a positron interacting
with an atomic or molecular target with Ne electrons and Na
nuclei (treated in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation) is

ri is the position of electron i, rA is the position of nucleus
A (with charge Z A), and r is the position of the positron,
all relative to an arbitrary origin. A direct solution of the
Schrödinger equation HΨ = EΨ for the total energy E and
the (Ne + 1)-particle wave function Ψ(r1, . . . , rNe, r) is nu-
merically intractable for systems with more than a few elec-
trons. We therefore proceed by ﬁrst calculating the energy and

2

wave function of the bare target (i.e., without the positron) in
its ground state, using the Hartree-Fock method. This wave
function Φ(r1, r2, . . . , rNe ) is a Slater determinant of the Ne
electronic spin orbitals. The positron-target interaction is then
taken to be

V(r) = Vst(r) + Vcor(r),

(4)

where Vst is the electrostatic potential of the target, calculated
at the Hartree-Fock level, and Vcor accounts for the correlation
eﬀects beyond the frozen-target Hartree-Fock approximation.
In what follows, we assume that the target is closed-shell;
thence there are Ne/2 doubly occupied electronic molecular
orbitals ϕi, and the electrostatic potential of the target is given
by

(5)

where dτ(cid:48) is the volume element associated with r(cid:48). The cor-
relation potential Vcor can be derived using many-body theory
[9, 44–49], or approximated using density-functional-theory
approaches, based on the positron correlation energy in an
electron gas and correct long-range asymptotic form [50, 51].
It can also be represented by a model potential with correct
long-range behavior and parametrized form at short range. This
approach has long been used for studying low-energy electron-
molecule scattering (see, e.g., Ref. [52]). Model potentials have
been used previously to study positron interactions with atoms
and polar molecules (see, e.g., Refs. [12, 43, 53, 54]).

So far, the many-body-theory approach has only been de-
veloped for atoms [55]. The density-functional-theory-based
approach has been used in quantum-chemistry calculations of
positron-molecule binding [56] but lacks the quantitative ac-
curacy. Following Refs. [1, 2], we use a model potential, viz.,

where αA is the hybrid dipole polarizability of atom A within
the target [57] (which for an atomic target is just the usual
atomic dipole polarizability), and ρA is a cutoﬀ radius speciﬁc
to atom A. At large distances from the target, Vcor(r) (cid:39) −α/2r 4
(where α = (cid:205)
A αA is the total polarizability of the target
and r is the distance from the target to the positron), which
is the asymptotic polarization potential for a positron inter-
acting with a closed-shell atom or spherical-top molecule.
For molecules with anisotropic polarizabilities, the asymp-
totic form of Vcor(r) is the spherical average of the anisotropic
polarization potential [58]. The function in brackets in Eq. (6)
moderates the unphysical growth of the potential near nucleus
A. Values of ρA correlate with the radius of atom A and are
typically in the range 1.5–3.0 a.u. [1, 2, 43].

The short-range part of Vcor eﬀectively parametrizes correla-
tion eﬀects other than polarization, such as virtual positronium
(Ps) formation. This latter is notoriously diﬃcult to describe
in an ab initio manner, as it requires large numbers of elec-
tron and positron partial waves [48, 59], or addition of basis

states centered at points outside the molecule [60, 61]. In our
approach, the precise analytical form of the short-range cut-
oﬀ function will not strongly aﬀect the results, so long as the
cutoﬀ radii ρA are chosen judiciously.

The single-particle Schrödinger equation for the positron,

(assumed to be in its rovibrational ground state) is optimized
at the Hartree-Fock level, using this basis. For the positron,
an even-tempered Gaussian basis has been adopted. For the
functions of a speciﬁc angular-momentum type (e.g., s, p, d)
centered on nucleus A, we choose the exponents ζAj as

(7)

is solved to obtain the positron energy ε and wave function
ψ(r), for the total potential (4). This is referred to as the frozen-
target-plus-polarization (FT+P) method in Ref. [1]. The total
wave function of the positron-target system is the product of the
electronic Slater determinant and the positron wave function:

Ψ(r1, r2, . . . , rNe, r) = Φ(r1, r2, . . . , rNe )ψ(r).

(8)

In practice, Eq. (7) is solved by expanding ψ(r) in a Gaussian
basis (see below). If the potential V(r) is suﬃciently attractive,
the eigenvalue spectrum will contain negative energies, which
correspond to the positron bound states. The binding energy
εb for such a state is related to its negative energy eigenvalue
ε by εb = |ε|. However, most (or all, for nonbinding species)
of the energy eigenvalues ε are positive, and the correspond-
ing wave functions represent positron pseudostates that span
the continuum. As shown in Secs. II C and II E, they can be
used to obtain information on positron scattering and direct
annihilation by the target.

B. Numerical details

The Hartree-Fock electronic molecular orbitals and the re-
sulting electrostatic potential of the molecule are calculated
using gamess [62, 63]. The Schrödinger equation for the
positron, Eq. (7), is solved using the neo package [64, 65],
which we have modiﬁed to include the model correlation po-
tential Vcor in the Roothaan equation for the positron [1].

The electron and positron wave functions are written in
terms of Gaussian basis sets, with several Gaussian primitives
centered on each of the atomic nuclei, viz.,

choices of ζA1, β, and N p
can be made for each nucleus. A
A
prudent choice of the smallest exponents ζA1 is very important
for an accurate description of weakly bound positron states.
At large distances, the bound-state wave function behaves as
ψ(r) ∼ e−κr /r, where κ =
2εb and εb is the binding energy.
To ensure that expansion (10) accurately describes the wave
function at distances r ∼ 1/κ, we must have ζA1 (cid:46) κ2 = 2εb.
For nonbinding targets, the value of ζA1 determines the energy
of the lowest positive-energy pseudostate, ε ∼ ζA1.

For the atomic targets (Be, Mg, He, and Ar), we have used
two diﬀerent positron basis sets. The ﬁrst consists of 12 s-type
Gaussians with ζA1 = 0.0001 and β = 3. The second consists
of 19 s-type Gaussians with ζA1 = 0.0001 and β = 2. These
shall be referred to as the 12s and 19s basis sets, respectively.
For H2, we have used three diﬀerent basis sets. The ﬁrst is
identical to the 12s basis set used for the atomic targets, but
with 12 s-type Gaussians centered on each H atom (making
a total of 24 basis functions). The second set is obtained by
taking the ﬁrst set and adding eight p-type Gaussians on each
H atom (each of these Gaussians has three projections, making
a total of 2 × 8 × 3 = 48 additional basis functions), the values
of the exponents ζAj starting from 0.0081 and increasing with
a common ratio of β = 3. The third set is obtained by taking
the second set and adding eight d-type Gaussians on each H
atom (each of these Gaussians has six projections, making a
total of 2 × 8 × 6 = 96 additional basis functions), again with
ζA1 = 0.0081 and β = 3. These shall be referred to as the 12s,
12s 8p, and 12s 8p 8d basis sets, respectively.

For N2 and Cl2, we use the 12s 8p 8d basis set again. Finally,
for CH4, we use the 12s 8p 8d basis functions on the C atom,
and on each of the H atoms, we use a set of 8 s-type Gaussians,
with ζA1 = 0.0081 and β = 3. This shall be referred to as the
12s 8p 8d / 8s basis set.

In Ref. [43], Mitroy and Ivanov used Vcor in the form of
Eq. (6) (with a single term in the sum over A) to investigate
positron interactions with a number of atomic targets, includ-
ing Be, Mg, He, Ar, and H. They determined appropriate values
of the cutoﬀ radius ρA for each atom by comparing the model-
potential calculations with accurate ab initio calculations. For
Be and Mg, for which a positron bound state exists, they chose
ρA so that the binding energy εb ﬁt a stochastic-variational cal-
culation [66]. For He and Ar, which do not bind the positron,
they determined ρA by comparing the s-wave scattering phase
shift at the positron momentum k = 0.1 a.u. with the Kohn-
variational calculation [67] (He) or polarized-orbital calcula-
tion [68] (Ar). For H, they determined ρA by comparing the
scattering length with close-coupling calculations [69, 70].

For Be, Mg, He, and Ar, we use the same values of αA
and ρA as given in Table I of Ref. [43]. This enables a direct
comparison of our results for the binding energies, scattering

phase shifts, and annihilation rates with those of Ref. [43].
For Ar, we also carry out calculations for a cutoﬀ radius of
ρAr = 1.88 a.u., chosen to reproduce the s-wave scattering
phase shift from the many-body-theory calculations by Green
et al. [44]. For H2, N2, CH4, and Cl2, we use the atomic
hybrid polarizabilities from Ref. [57]. We take the cutoﬀ radius
for H to be ρH = 2.051 a.u. [43]. For C and N, we take
the cutoﬀ radius to be the same as for H (as was done in
Refs. [1, 2]). Finally, for Cl we use either ρCl = 1.88 a.u., i.e.,
the second cutoﬀ radius of Ar (its periodic-table neighbor), or
ρCl = 2.20 a.u., chosen to reproduce the experimental binding
energy εb = 57 meV for CCl4 [26]. The latter value of the
cutoﬀ radius is in accord with the fact that the mean radius of
the valence orbital in Cl is 10% larger than that of Ar [71].
These data are summarized in Table I.

C. Elastic scattering

After solving the Schrödinger equation (7), the positive-
energy pseudostates can be used to extract information about
positron elastic scattering from the target. Speciﬁcally, we can
ﬁnd values of the s-wave scattering phase shift for a set of
discrete energies [72]. We restrict our interest to the low-energy
region ε < 0.5 a.u., which corresponds to positron momenta
k < 1 a.u.

For a spherically symmetric (atomic) target, each positive-
energy pseudostate has a deﬁnite orbital angular momentum
l. The wave function of each pseudostate factorizes into radial
and angular parts as

ψ(r) =

1

r

P(r)Ylm(Ω),

(13)

where Ylm is a spherical harmonic, with m the magnetic quan-
tum number. We restrict our interest to s-wave scattering, and
ignore the pseudostates with l > 0. For atoms, our positron
basis sets contain only s-type Gaussians, so all of the pseu-
dostates do, in fact, have l = 0, with Y00 = 1/

4π.

For molecular targets, the lack of spherical symmetry means
that the pseudostates do not have a deﬁnite angular momentum.
However, for small nonpolar molecules, the mixing of the
positron partial waves by the potential is small at low positron
energies [72]. Hence, we can select the “s-type” pseudostates,

√

4

for which the expectation value of the squared orbital angular
momentum operator L2 (see Appendix A) is close to zero.

For a true positron continuum state with l = 0, the asymp-

totic form of the radial wave function is

P(r) (cid:39)

A sin(kr + δ0)
k

,

(14)

√

where A is a normalization constant and δ0(k) is the s-wave
scattering phase shift. One way to ﬁnd δ0, is to ﬁt the radial
function P(r) for a positive-energy pseudostate to the asymp-
totic form (14) with k =
2ε at intermediate values of r,
for which the potential V(r) is negligible compared to the
positron energy, while the wave function is still described well
by the Gaussian basis. For s-type states in molecules, we can
also spherically average the positron wave function around the
molecular center of mass (see Appendix B), before ﬁtting to
Eq. (14).

However, we found that ﬁtting the pseudostate wave func-
tions to Eq. (14) resulted in values of δ0 that were sensitive
to the range of r used for the ﬁt, making it diﬃcult to obtain
reliable phase shifts in this way. We have therefore adopted
an alternative and more universal method which allowed us to
determine the phase shifts using only the energy eigenvalues.
In this method one ﬁrst solves the Schrödinger equation for
a free positron [i.e., Eq. (7) with V(r) = 0] using a Gaussian
basis. This gives a discrete set of positive-energy pseudostates,
and as before, we retain only the s-type states. We denote the
energies of these states by ε(0)
n , where n = 1, 2, . . . . Since
these energies increase monotonically with n, there exists an
invertible function f of a continuous variable n such that

f (n) = ε(0)
n

(15)

for positive integer n.

Solving the Schrödinger equation for the positron in the ﬁeld
of the target [i.e., Eq. (7) with V(r) given by Eq. (4)] in the same
basis, and retaining only the s-type states, yields a diﬀerent set
of energy eigenvalues, which we denote εn. If the positron-
target potential supports one or more bound s-type levels,
the corresponding value(s) of εn will be negative. Let ∆εn
denote the diﬀerence between εn and the corresponding free-
particle energy ε(0)
n . A positive (negative)
value of ∆εn indicates that the positron-target interaction is
eﬀectively repulsive (attractive) at the positron energy εn, and
consequently one expects the s-wave scattering phase shift to
be smaller (greater) than Nsπ, where Ns is the number of bound
s levels supported by the potential [73]. For n > Ns, i.e., for
the positive-energy pseudostates, the energies εn are related to
the s-wave phase shift by

Equation (16) is inverted to determine the phase shift as

n and constructing a continuous function
f −1(ε) by interpolation.

In practice, for even-tempered Gaussian basis sets, the en-
ergies ε(0)
n and εn grow approximately exponentially with n,
making f (n) a rapidly changing function. Hence, we plot val-
ues of n against ln ε(0)
n and interpolate them to obtain a function
g(ln ε) ≡ f −1(ε). Since the values of ln ε(0)
n grow in a near-
linear fashion with n, this interpolation is accurate and robust.
The phase shift at the positron energy εn is then given by

δ0 = [n − g(ln εn)]π.

(18)

As an example, in Fig. 1, black circles show n plotted against
ln ε(0)
n , where the ε(0)
n are the free-particle energies computed
using the 12s atomic basis set [recall that g(ln ε) = n for ε =
ε(0)
n ]. Only the data for the seven states with ε(0)
n < 0.5 a.u. are
shown. The black dashed line is the function g(ln ε) obtained
as a cubic-spline ﬁt to the free-particle data. Finally, the ﬁgure
shows the values of ln εn and the corresponding values of
g(ln εn) for a positron in the ﬁeld V(r) of the Be atom (red
crosses). Note that Be has a bound s state for the positron
(ε1 < 0), so the ﬁrst cross corresponds to n = 2. The phase
shifts obtained in this way are shown in Sec. III.

at small k, provides estimates of the scattering length a. If
the positron-target potential supports a weakly bound s state
with binding energy εb = −ε1 > 0, the scattering length will
be positive and large in magnitude, and related to the binding
energy by εb (cid:39) 1/2a2. In contrast, a large negative scattering
length indicates the presence of a low-lying virtual s level
with energy ε ≈ 1/2a2. In either case, the zero-energy elastic
scattering cross section σ = 4πa2 is much greater than the

geometrical cross-sectional area of the target [75]. The rate
of positron direct annihilation is similarly enhanced [28, 47],
e.g., as observed in Ar, Kr, and Xe [44] (see Secs. II E and III).
As an example, Fig. 2 shows the values of k cot δ0 for Be for
the lowest three positive-energy pseudostates, as calculated in
the 12s basis set. Also shown are four diﬀerent ﬁts, based on
Eq. (19), that have been used to estimate the scattering length
a, as follows:

where a (the scattering length), C, C1, and C2 are ﬁtting pa-
rameters, and α = 38 a.u. is the polarizability of Be. Fits (20a)
and (20c) use only the lowest-momentum value of δ0; ﬁt (20b)
uses only the ﬁrst two pseudostates, and ﬁt (20d) uses all three
pseudostates. The resulting estimates of the scattering length
are a = 15.95 [ﬁt (20a)], 14.98 [ﬁt (20b)], 15.22 [ﬁt (20c)],
and 15.03 a.u. [ﬁt (20d)]. The two estimates that are closest
to each other are those obtained using ﬁts (20b) and (20d).
Consequently, we will use the simpler of these ﬁts, Eq. (20b),
throughout, i.e., perform a linear ﬁt for k cot δ0 in terms of k
using the two lowest-energy pseudostates.

D. Annihilation from a bound state

also known as the contact density, and Ψ(r1, . . . , rNe, r) is the
total wave function of the positron bound state, normalized to

In the independent-particle approximation, the total wave

function has the form of Eq. (8), and Eq. (22) reduces to

The independent-particle approximation does not account for
the electron-positron Coulomb attraction at short range that
increases the contact density. As a result, Eq. (23) underesti-
mates the true value of δep. This deﬁciency can be rectiﬁed by
introducing enhancement factors γi ≥ 1, which are speciﬁc to
each electronic molecular orbital, into Eq. (23), viz.,

where Φ(r1, . . . , rNe ) is the ground-state wave function of the
target, k (k(cid:48)) is the momentum of the positron before (after)
the collision, and fel(k, k(cid:48)) is the elastic scattering amplitude,
with k = k (cid:48) [78].

Due to the use of a discrete Gaussian basis, the positive-
energy positron pseudostates that we calculate are not bona
ﬁde scattering states; they decay exponentially, rather than os-
cillate, at large positron-target separations, and are normalized
to unity [see Eq. (25)], instead of an asymptotic plane wave, as
in Eq. (30). However, extraction of the values of Zeﬀ at the en-
ergies of the pseudostates is still possible. As in the calculation
of the elastic scattering phase shift, we consider only s-type
pseudostates. This means that we calculate only the s-wave
contribution to Zeﬀ, which dominates at low positron momenta
k. Here, the contributions of higher partial waves to Zeﬀ are
suppressed as (k Ra)2l, where Ra is the radius of the target,
so are typically small, unless one of the higher partial waves
possesses a shape resonance. In principle, the method could
be extended to compute the contributions to Zeﬀ from higher
partial waves by considering the non-s-type pseudostates.

The s-wave part of the positron scattering wave function,

normalized according to Eq. (30), has the asymptotic form

ψ(r) (cid:39)

sin(kr + δ0)
kr

.

(31)

Comparing this with Eqs. (13) and (14), we see that Zeﬀ for
the s-wave positron can then be found as

Zeﬀ =

4π
A2 δep,

(32)

where δep is the contact density calculated for a positive-
energy s-type pseudostate, normalized by Eq. (25). The nor-
malization constant A can be determined by ﬁtting the radial
part of the positive-energy pseudostate by the form (14) in
an intermediate range of r. In the case of a molecular tar-
get, the wave functions of s-type pseudostates should also be
spherically averaged before ﬁtting (see Appendix B). A sim-
ilar approach was used in Ref. [79] to compute the pickoﬀ
annihilation parameter 1 Zeﬀ for Ps-atom collisions.

As an example, Fig. 3 shows the radial function P(r) for a
positron incident on Be, calculated using the 12s basis, for the
ﬁrst and third positive-energy pseudostates. (Since Be supports
a bound state for the positron, these are actually the n = 2 and
n = 4 pseudostates, respectively.) Also shown are ﬁts of the
form (14). The phase shift δ0 has been taken as a parameter of
the ﬁt. Note that due to the presence of a bound state, the radial
functions P(r) have a node at r ≈ 18 a.u., even for the lowest
positive-energy pseudostate (n = 2). The range of r used for
the ﬁt is chosen in the region between the ﬁrst and second
extrema of P(r). Thus, for n = 2 we used r = 10–50 a.u., and

for n = 2, r = 10–25 a.u. For larger r, the decrease of the
pseudostate wave function due to the use of the Gaussian basis
becomes apparent.

There is, however, an alternative way of determining the
values of A2, that does not rely on the ﬁtting of the radial wave
function and is free from related uncertainties. The use of a
ﬁnite discrete Gaussian basis eﬀectively conﬁnes the positron
within a soft-walled cavity of (varying) radius R0. In this case,
the neighboring positive-energy pseudostates are separated by
a momentum diﬀerence ∆k ≈ π/R0. Away from the target, the
wave function of s states takes the form

III. RESULTS

We ﬁrst test the method by computing the binding energy εb
and contact density δep for the positron bound states in Be and
Mg. The results are shown in Table II, along with a summary
of previously published results.

For Be, changing from the 12s basis to the 19s basis in-
creases the binding energy by 1.3% and the contact density by
1.2%. Such small changes show that the 12s basis is already
almost complete. Comparing our 19s binding energy with the
stochastic-variational calculation of Mitroy and Ryzhikh [66],
which was used as the reference in determining the values of
ρA [43], we see that we have agreement at the level of 0.6%.

This very small discrepancy can be ascribed to a slightly dif-
ferent description of the electrostatic ﬁeld of the Be atom and
possibly also due to our basis set not being totally complete.
The best currently available value of the binding energy is the
more recent stochastic-variational calculation [84]; both our
12s and 19s values are in close agreement with this result.

Regarding the contact density for Be, the present values are
12–14% larger than those of Mitroy and Ryzhikh [66]. The
diﬀerence is partly because the Hartree-Fock method, which
was used to compute the electrostatic potential of the Be atom,
underestimates the ionization potential of the atom, i.e., the
Hartree-Fock energy of the valence orbital is too small in
magnitude, which leads to an overestimate of the enhance-
ment factor from Eq. (27). Table III shows the Hartree-Fock
energies of the 1s and 2s orbitals of the Be atom, along with
the contribution δ(nl)
ep to the contact density δep from each or-
bital nl, calculated using the 19s positron basis without and
with the enhancement factors, Eqs. (23) and (26). Also shown
is the experimental value of the energy of the valence 2s or-
bital [91], along with the enhanced value of δ(2s)
ep obtained
using this experimental energy. Adding the enhanced contri-
butions to δep of the core 1s orbital and the valence 2s orbital,
where the experimental 2s energy has been used to calculate
the enhancement factor, gives δep = 7.946×10−3 a.u. This is in
much better agreement with the value of Mitroy and Ryzhikh
[66], at the level of 3.6%. The remaining discrepancy is partly
due to our use Eq. (27) to compute the enhancement factors.
If we instead scale the unenhanced contact density by Mitroy
and Ryzhikh’s enhancement factors of 2.5 for the 1s orbital and
10.18 for the 2s orbital [66], we obtain δep = 8.367×10−3 a.u.,
within 1.5% of the value in Ref. [66].

For Mg, the two basis sets give essentially identical results
for both the binding energy and the contact density. The dif-
ference in the present binding energy from that of Ref. [66]
is 0.4%. The best currently available calculation by Bromley
and Mitroy [82] gives the binding energy which is 10% greater
than our model-potential value.

Our calculated contact density for Mg is 25% larger than that
of Ref. [66]. Again, this diﬀerence is mostly due to an overes-

8

timation of the enhancement factor for the valence 3s orbital
when using the Hartree-Fock orbital energy. Table III shows
the Hartree-Fock energy of each orbital of the Mg atom, along
with the contribution δ(nl)
ep to the contact density δep from each
orbital, as calculated using the 19s positron basis, without and
with the enhancement factors. Also shown is the experimental
value of the energy of the valence 3s orbital [91], along with
the enhanced contribution of the 3s orbital to δep, obtained us-
ing this energy. Adding the enhanced contribution to δep from
the core orbitals to that from the valence 3s orbital, where the
experimental 3s energy has been used to calculate the enhance-
ment factor, gives δep = 1.982 × 10−2 a.u., which is within
4.9% of the value of Mitroy and Ryzhikh [66]. Again, the re-
maining discrepancy may be partly due to our use of Eq. (27)
for the enhancement factors. If we instead scale the unen-
hanced contact density by Mitroy and Ryzhikh’s enhancement
factors of 2.5 for the core orbitals and 13.2 for the 3s orbital
[66], we obtain δep = 1.965 × 10−2 a.u., which reduces the
discrepancy to 4.0%. Interestingly, the latter value of δep is
in near-exact agreement with the recommended conﬁguration-
interaction value of 1.962 × 10−2 a.u. [82].

We next consider positron elastic scattering from Be, Mg,
He, and Ar. Figure 4 shows the s-wave phase shifts for the four
atoms, obtained from Eq. (18), as functions of the positron mo-
mentum. For each of the atoms, the phase shifts obtained using
the 12s and 19s positron basis sets are very close. Figure 4 also
shows results of several existing calculations.

For Be and Mg, most of the existing calculations use model
potentials [98]. We obtain near-exact agreement with the cal-
culation of Bromley et al. [92], which used the same model
as the present calculations, with just slightly diﬀerent values
of the cutoﬀ radii: ρBe = 2.7084 a.u. and ρMg = 3.0720 a.u.
We obtain excellent agreement with the other calculations, ex-
cept the many-body-theory calculation for Mg of Gribakin and
King [89]; however, that calculation overestimated the attrac-
tive virtual-Ps-formation component of the many-body corre-
lation potential, which resulted in a larger binding energy (see
Table II) and higher phase shifts. Also, this is the only calcula-
tion shown that incorporated the Ps-formation channel which
is open for k > 0.25 a.u., making the phase shift complex and
leading to a rapid momentum dependence of Re δ0.

For He, we have very close agreement with the calculation
of Mitroy and Ivanov [43] that used the same model poten-
tial. We also obtain excellent agreement with the near-exact
Kohn-variational calculation of van Reeth and Humberston
[67] (which was used in Ref. [43] to choose the value of ρHe)
and the recent many-body-theory calculation of Green et al.
[44]. For Ar, the calculations with ρAr = 1.710 a.u. closely
follow the polarized-orbital calculation of McEachran et al.
[68] (which was the reference calculation for choosing ρAr in
Ref. [43]). On the other hand, using ρAr = 1.88 a.u., we re-
produce the more advanced many-body-theory calculation of
Green et al. [44] across the energy range considered.

Table IV shows the values of the scattering length obtained
for Be, Mg, He, and Ar, using the 12s and 19s basis sets, along
with a selection of existing calculations and an experimental
datum for Ar. Note that for He and Ar, which do not bind the
positron, the scattering length has been calculated via Eq. (20b)

using the second and third positive-energy pseudostates rather
than the ﬁrst and second positive-energy pseudostates. This is

because for the ﬁrst positive-energy pseudostate (n = 1), we
have ∆εn < 0, which means that to calculate the phase shift
for this pseudostate, one has to extrapolate g(ln ε) to a value
of ε that is smaller than the lowest free-particle energy, ε(0)
1 .
Such extrapolation is less reliable than interpolation to values
of ε that are within the range of the free-particle energies.

For both Be and Mg, the 12s value of the scattering length
is 10% larger than the 19s value. For He and Ar, the diﬀerence
between the 12s and 19s values is much smaller, less than
1%. Broadly speaking, there is reasonably good agreement
with the existing calculations for all four atoms. We can make
a direct comparison with the results of Ref. [43], where the
same model was used as in the present calculations (taking
ρAr = 1.710 a.u.). Our 19s values of the scattering length for
Be, Mg, He, and Ar are in agreement with those of Ref. [43]
at the level of 13%, 0.75%, 5.1%, and 9.6%, respectively. The
discrepancies are due to the diﬀerent method we have used to
extract the scattering length: we have used an eﬀective-range-
theory ﬁt to the s-wave phase shift, while in Ref. [43] it is
inferred from the zero-energy elastic scattering cross section

and positive (since they support weakly bound states for the
positron), while for He and Ar it is negative. For Ar it is quite
large in magnitude. Using our 19s value of the scattering length
for ρAr = 1.88 a.u., a = −4.76 a.u., we estimate the energy of
the virtual level to be ε ≈ 1/2a2 = 0.022 a.u. This scattering
length is in perfect agreement with experiment [106], though
the latter has relatively large error bars.

Finally, we compute the annihilation parameter Zeﬀ for Be,
Mg, He, and Ar. Figure 5 shows the results, along with sev-
eral previous calculations, some of which reported the s-wave
component of Zeﬀ (which is what we calculate), while others
reported the total Zeﬀ. For each target atom, we show values of
Zeﬀ obtained from Eq. (32) with either the 12s or 19s positron
basis, and using the normalization factor A2 from either the
radial ﬁt (14) (as in Fig. 3) or from Eq. (38). For Ar, the re-
sults for ρAr = 1.710 a.u. and ρAr = 1.88 a.u. are presented in
separate panels.

Considering Zeﬀ as a function of k, our results are largely in-
dependent of the positron basis set used, and of the method of
normalization of the positron wave function. The most signiﬁ-
cant discrepancies occur for small k. In fact, with the exception
of the 12s basis set, the value of Zeﬀ that comes from the ﬁrst
positive-energy pseudostate for each atom appears to be an out-
lier that sits above the trend set by the other pseudostates with
small momenta. The exact reason for this behavior is unclear,
but it may relate to the uncertainty in normalizing the lowest-
energy pseudostate correctly. The 12s basis with normalization
determined by radial ﬁt appears to yield smaller values of Zeﬀ
near k = 0 when compared to the other calculations.

Figure 5 shows that for all atoms except He, the Zeﬀ is
strongly enhanced at low positron momenta. This occurs when
the positron-atom potential supports a weakly bound or low-
lying virtual s level. In this case the momentum dependence
of Zeﬀ at low momenta k has the form [28, 44, 46, 47, 108]

Zeﬀ =

F
κ2 + k2

+ B,

(39)

where B and F are constants. The ﬁrst term, in which κ ≈ 1/a
(|κ| (cid:28) 1), with a the scattering length, is due to the s-wave
component of the positron wave function being “in resonance”
with the bound or virtual level. The constant B accounts for
the nonresonant background Zeﬀ, which depends weakly on k.
Figure 5 shows ﬁts of the form (39) for the calculations that
used the 19s positron basis set and the analytical estimate for
the normalization of the positron wave function; the values
of the ﬁtting parameters are given in Table V. Note that the
outlying value of Zeﬀ for the ﬁrst positive-energy pseudostate
was ignored when determining the ﬁtting parameters.

As expected, the atom with the largest threshold value of
Zeﬀ is Be (Zeﬀ ≈ 127 for the 19s calculation), which has the
largest absolute value of the scattering length, i.e., the smallest
κ. The He atom has the smallest threshold value of Zeﬀ and,
overall, the weakest dependence of Zeﬀ on k.

For all atoms, there is broadly good agreement with the
model-potential calculations of Mitroy and Ivanov [43] for low
momenta. (For Ar, we only compare the results of Ref. [43]
with the present calculations for ρAr = 1.710 a.u.) Note that

the results of Ref. [43] are for the total Zeﬀ, not just the s-
wave component: at higher momenta, the results of Ref. [43]
become signiﬁcantly larger than the present results due to the
contribution of higher partial waves. This is particularly con-
spicuous for Mg, where the total Zeﬀ is strongly peaked at
k ≈ 0.2 a.u. due to a p-wave shape resonance [43]. We note
that at k = 0, all of the present values of Zeﬀ, except for the
12s calculation with the radial-ﬁt normalization, are 10–20%
larger than those predicted by Ref. [43]. This is at least partly
due to the enhancement factors used in the present work being
larger than those used by Mitroy and Ivanov [43].

For He, we observe excellent agreement at

low mo-
menta with the polarized-orbital calculation of total Zeﬀ of
McEachran et al. [97] and with the many-body-theory calcula-
tion of s-wave Zeﬀ [44]. For Ar, the agreement with Ref. [97]
is better for ρAr = 1.88 a.u. than for ρAr = 1.710 a.u. For
ρAr = 1.88 a.u. we also have good agreement with the many-
body-theory calculation of s-wave Zeﬀ [44], though the present
results are slightly larger. For Mg, our 12s calculation with
normalization determined using the radial ﬁt is in excellent
agreement with the model-potential calculation of s-wave Zeﬀ
of Mitroy et al. [95], but once more, our other calculations
give somewhat larger values.

Overall, our calculations show that positive-energy square-
integrable pseudostates can be used to determine the s-wave
scattering phase shifts and the normalized rates Zeﬀ for
positron in-ﬂight annihilation at low energies.

B. Molecules: H2, N2, Cl2, and CH4

We now turn our attention to positron interactions with small
molecules. We ﬁrst consider H2, for which there has already
been a signiﬁcant amount of theoretical and experimental in-
vestigation of scattering and annihilation. We will examine the
dependence of the s-wave scattering phase shift and Zeﬀ on the
choice of the positron basis, and the sensitivity of Zeﬀ to the
method used to normalize the positron pseudostates.

Figure 6 shows the s-wave phase shift for H2, obtained from
Eq. (18) using the 12s, 12s 8p, and 12s 8p 8d positron basis
sets. These data correspond to the internuclear distance of R =
1.39 a.u. Overall, there is little diﬀerence between the three sets
of results. However, at k ≈ 0.2 a.u., the 12s 8p calculation gives
a smaller phase shift than the others. We note that this occurs
for the ﬁfth data point, which is where the p-type Gaussians
start to contribute. The ﬁgure also shows the Kohn-variational

wave function that is referred to as Ψ(1, A)
in Ref. [109]. The
present calculations are in near-perfect agreement with those
of Cooper et al. [109] at small momenta. This is clear evidence
of the ability of the present method to accurately describe low-
energy scattering of positrons by small molecules. Finally, the
ﬁgure shows the phase shift of Fedus et al. [110], which was

of this ﬁt is very close to the present calculation for positron
momenta k (cid:46) 0.1 a.u., but lies slightly higher at larger k.

−2.39 a.u., respectively. As was the case for the atomic targets
that did not support a bound state for the positron, we have
calculated these values using the second and third positive-
energy pseudostates. While the 12s and 12s 8p 8d basis sets
give almost exactly the same value for the scattering length, the
12s 8p gives a value 4% larger in magnitude. The 12s 8p 8d
value of a = −2.39 a.u. should be considered the most reliable.
It is close to the stochastic-variational calculations, which gave
a = −2.6 (R = 1.40 a.u.) [112], a = −2.71 (R = 1.45 a.u.)
[104], and a = −2.79 a.u. (R = 1.45 a.u.) [113], and is in good
agreement with the convergent-close-coupling calculation of
Zammit et al., which gave a = −2.49 a.u. (R = 1.40 a.u.)
[114]. We also note the existence of an R-matrix calculation of
Zhang et al., which gave a = −2.06 a.u. (R = 1.40 a.u.) [115].
Figure 7 shows the s-wave phase shift for N2, Cl2, and
CH4, obtained using the 12s 8p 8d basis for N2 and Cl2 and
the 12s 8p 8d / 8s basis for CH4. These molecules are more
polarizable and more attractive for the positron than H2. The
scattering calculations for these targets indicate the presence
of virtual states (N2, CH4, and Cl2 with ρCl = 2.20 a.u.), or
possibly even a weakly bound state (Cl2, ρCl = 1.88 a.u.).

For N2, we obtain the scattering length by extrapolating
tan δ0/k towards k = 0, and ﬁnd a = −4.6 ± 0.1 a.u. (The error
bars reﬂect the uncertainty of eﬀective-range-type extrapola-
tion procedure.) Positron scattering from N2 is similar to that
from Ar. This could be expected, since the dipole polarizability
of N2 is α = 12.9 a.u., which is close to 11.1 a.u. for Ar.

For Cl2, our calculations with the smaller cutoﬀ radius ρCl =
1.88 a.u., predict a weakly bound state with εb = 4.004 ×
10−4 a.u. and δep = 5.391 × 10−3 a.u. We can then estimate
the scattering length as a ≈ 1/
2εb = 35.5 a.u. Examining
the behaviour of k cot δ0 suggests a noticeable uncertainty in
the value of the lowest-energy phase shift δ0 (that is hard to
discern on the scale of Fig. 7). We thus use the second and third

to the fact that for large scattering lengths, the validity of the

than the results of existing stochastic variational calculations,
which gave Zeﬀ = 15.7 [104, 112] and 15.8 [113], and should
be regarded as more accurate. At thermal (room-temperature)
energies, corresponding to the momentum k = 0.053 a.u.,
we obtain Zeﬀ = 10.6. This is close to the R-matrix value of
10.4 [115], but smaller than the recommended experimental
room-temperature value of Zeﬀ = 16.0 ± 0.2 [119].

The momentum dependence of Zeﬀ for N2, Cl2, and CH4
is shown in Fig. 9. Again, ﬁts of the form (39) were carried
out, with the ﬁrst pseudostate excluded from the ﬁt. The ﬁtting
parameters are given in Table VI. The values of κ obtained from
the ﬁt can be used to verify the scattering lengths for Cl2 and
CH4. In the presence of a weakly bound or low-lying virtual
level, the value of κ in the momentum dependence of Zeﬀ,
Eq. (39), is related to the scattering length by a ≈ 1/κ. Using
κ from Table VI, we ﬁnd a = 28.7 a.u. or −53.5 a.u. for Cl2
with ρCl = 1.88 or 2.20 a.u., respectively, and a = −18.3 a.u.
for CH4. The values for Cl2 are close to the estimates obtained
from the binding energy (for ρCl = 1.88) and extrapolation of
the phase shifts. The value for CH4 is almost within the error
bars of the scattering length obtained from the phase shift.

The calculated values of Zeﬀ at thermal momentum k =
0.053 a.u., are 29.3, 351, 254, and 145 for N2, Cl2 (ρCl =
1.88 a.u.), Cl2 (ρCl = 2.20 a.u.), and CH4, respectively. The
experimental values, which are also shown in Fig. 9, are 30.8±
0.2 for N2 [119], 1600 for Cl2 [120], and 140.0 ± 0.8 for CH4
[119]. The agreement with experiment is excellent for both
N2 and CH4. For CH4 we also compare the calculated Zeﬀ
with energy-resolved annihilation measurements [18, 121]; see
Fig. 10. The present calculation indicates a slightly stronger
energy dependence for Zeﬀ than seen in the experiment, but
the overall agreement is very satisfactory.

For Cl2, the calculated Zeﬀ values are much smaller than
the measured room-temperature value of Zeﬀ = 1600 [120].
Unfortunately, this early measurement has never been repeated
by other experimental groups, so one may query the accuracy
of this large value. On the side of theory, the calculated values
represent only the contribution of direct, in-ﬂight annihilation
to Zeﬀ. There is not much diﬀerence between the Zeﬀ obtained
using ρCl = 1.88 and 2.20 a.u. However, the calculation with
the smaller cutoﬀ radius, predicts that the positron has a bound
state with Cl2. In this case, the resonant annihilation mecha-
nism operates alongside direct annihilation [28, 30]. For a
molecule with one vibrational mode, the thermally avergaged
contribution of resonant annihilation to Zeﬀ can be estimated

length estimated from the binding energy is more reliable.

For Cl2 with ρCl = 2.20 a.u., the positron-molecule potential
is not attractive enough to support a bound state. However, the
very rapid growth of the s-wave phase shift at small momenta
indicates the presence of a low-lying virtual s level. Using
linear extrapolation of tan δ0/k towards k = 0 gives a = −65 ±
5 a.u, where the errors bars again reﬂect the uncertainty of the
extrapolation procedure. This large negative scattering lengths
indicates a virtual level with the energy ε ≈ 1/2a2 ∼ 10−4 a.u.
For CH4, we estimate that the scattering length to be
a = −17 ± 1 a.u. This indicates the presence of a low-lying
virtual level, with energy ε ≈ 1/2a2 = 1.5 × 10−3 a.u. A recent
Schwinger multichannel calculation of the e+-CH4 scattering
length by Zecca et al. gave a = −7.4 a.u. [116]. This is no-
ticeably smaller in magnitude than the present estimate, indi-
cating weaker positron-target attraction (possibly as a result of
an incomplete account of the diﬃcult virtual Ps contribution).
An older semiempirical calculation by Frongillo et al. gave
a = −13.0 a.u. [117], which is closer to our estimate.

Figure 8 shows Zeﬀ as a function of the positron momentum
for H2. As was the case for the atomic targets, the results are
largely independent of the choice of positron basis set and
the method of determining the normalization of the positron
wave function. However, for all three basis sets, the lowest
positive-energy pseudostate appears to give values of Zeﬀ that
are too large when the analytical estimate for the normalization,
Eq. (38), is used. The ﬁgure also shows a ﬁt of the form (39)
to the 12s 8p 8d calculation using the analytical estimate for
the normalization, with the ﬁrst pseudostate excluded from
the ﬁt; the ﬁtting parameters are given in Table VI. Finally,
the ﬁgure shows the Kohn-variational calculation of Armour
and Baker [118], with which we obtain very good agreement.
Our predicted zero-energy value of Zeﬀ is 11.1. This is lower

orange line, ﬁt of the form (39); black circles, experimental data [18,
121]; black diamond, experimental room-temperature value shown at
thermal energy (0.0379 eV) [119].

Adding this to the corresponding direct contribution, gives the
total value of Zeﬀ = 667, which is still signiﬁcantly smaller
than the measured value. In principle, the resonant annihila-
tion contribution can be made bigger by allowing for a larger
binding energy εb. This will increase both the contact density
δep and the Boltzmann-type factor in Eq. (40). However, in-
creasing the binding energy requires a smaller value of ρCl,
which is hard to justify physically. In all of the present cal-
culations of Zeﬀ, we have neglected the rotational motion of
the molecule. Of course, in room-temperature measurements
of Zeﬀ, the molecule can be in a variety of rotationally excited
states. However, for s-wave positron attachment, the rotational
state of the molecule does not change, and the Zeﬀ is not ex-
pected to be noticeably aﬀected by molecular rotations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

A model-potential approach has been used to study low-
energy positron interactions with a range of atoms and small
nonpolar molecules. The positron-target correlation potential
that we use accounts for long-range polarization of the target.
Short-range correlations are parametrized by a cutoﬀ radius
whose values can be speciﬁc for each type of atom within the
target. These values can be chosen to reproduce existing accu-
rate calculations of positron binding or scattering from atomic
targets, or other data, e.g., measured positron-molecule bind-
ing energies. Positron binding energies and bound-state an-
nihilation rates (where bound states exist), scattering phase
shifts, scattering lengths, and the annihilation parameter Zeﬀ
have been calculated. The results compare very favorably with
existing calculations and experimental data. In particular, we
have obtained Zeﬀ values for N2 and CH4 in excellent agree-
ment with well-established room-temperature values. For CH4,
our calculations conﬁrmed the role played by the low-lying vir-
tual state in producing enhanced Zeﬀ at low positron energies,
which was conjectured long time ago [108]. One exception is
Cl2, where the present Zeﬀ strongly underestimates the early

tion, as it is not clear that even the presence of a weakly bound
positron state and associated resonant annihilation can bridge
the gap between theory and experiment.

On the technical side, the calculations for atoms conﬁrmed
the applicability of Gaussian bases to the problem of positron
binding. More importantly, we have shown how to use positive-
energy pseudostates to study positron scattering and direct
annihilation. Our calculations also proved the validity of en-
hancement factors for the calculation of annihilation rates, i.e.,
the contact density δep for the positron bound states and Zeﬀ
for positron scattering.

Although the theoretical description of

the positron-
molecule interaction is not ab initio, it appears to capture the
essential physics of the positron-molecule problem correctly.
The advantage of the present technique over ab initio meth-
ods (which have so far failed to accurately predict positron-
molecule binding energies) is that it can easily be used for
large molecules, with very little computational expense. The
main source of uncertainty in the binding energies and con-
tact densities, and in the phase shifts and Zeﬀ at low energies,
is the choice of cutoﬀ radii for the model correlation poten-
tial. However, if the cutoﬀ radius for each type of atom can
be chosen by reference to an accurate ab initio calculation of
the positron binding energy or s-wave phase shift, then us-
ing these cutoﬀ radii in molecular systems is expected to give
reliable results, as we have have demonstrated, e.g., in calcu-
lating the phase shift for H2. An additional source uncertainty
of the present approach is that for larger, non–spherical-top
molecules, the molecular polarizability tensor can be signif-
icantly anisotropic, which our correlation potential does not
account for. In any case, we expect that the uncertainty in our
results for positron binding or low-energy scattering should
not exceed 10–20%. The use of a parametrized formula for the
annihilation enhancement factors also introduces some uncer-
tainty in the contact densities and Zeﬀ, although the agreement
of our calculated s-wave Zeﬀ for H2 with the Kohn-variational
calculations, and of our thermal Zeﬀ for N2 and CH4 with
the experimental data, indicates that the formula describes the
enhancement very well.

We intend to use the method to investigate positron binding
to other larger molecules, in particular, large species for which
there are no existing ab initio calculations. (Our earlier use of
the method to investigate positron binding to alkane molecules
was very successful in reproducing the experimental trends
[2].) In addition to having values of the cutoﬀ radii for C and H
atoms [1, 2], this work has provided values for N and Cl atoms
that can be used to investigate positron binding to nitriles
and chlorinated hydrocarbons (although the value for Cl is
more tentative), for which some experimental measurements
of the binding energy already exist [20, 25]. Determining an
appropriate value of the cutoﬀ radius for an O atom would
enable calculations for alcohol, aldehydes, ketones, formates,
and acetates. It should also be possible to use the method to
calculate Zeﬀ for polar molecules.

In addition to computing binding energies and bound-
state annihilation rates, scattering phase shifts, and Zeﬀ, for
molecules that bind the positron we will calculate the annihi-

lation γ-ray spectra, for which much of the experimental data
[122] remained unexplained for a long time [123] and are only
starting to be investigated now [124].

so we require expressions for the integrals (cid:104)k |2x ∂/∂ x| j(cid:105),
(cid:104)k |2y ∂/∂ y| j(cid:105), etc. We deﬁne the overlap integral (cid:104)k | j(cid:105) be-
tween two Gaussian basis functions, and for later convenience,
we explicitly show the powers nx

Appendix B: Spherical averaging of positron wave function in a
Gaussian basis

The spherically averaged positron wave function is given by

(B1)

where, as in Appendix A, we have combined the index A that
enumerates the nuclei with the index j that enumerates the
basis functions centered on each nucleus into a single index
that enumerates all of the basis functions across all centers,
and we have dropped the superscript (p) from the expansion
coeﬃcients of the positron wave function. The origin of coor-
dinates is chosen to be at the position of the molecule’s center
of mass. The function Ij is simply the integral of basis function
j over the solid angle:

∫

Ij(r) =

gj(r) dΩ.

(B2)

(A20)

To ﬁnd an expression for Ij, we use spherical polar coordinates
(r, θ, φ), which gives

Ij(r) =

We consider two cases: ﬁrst, where only s-type basis functions
are used, and second, where basis functions of general angular
momenta are used.

If, in fact, rj = 0 (i.e., the basis function is centered on the

origin), then Eq. (B3) becomes

s-type functions only

j

If only s-type basis functions are used, then nx
j

=
0 for all j. Since an s-type basis function is a function only
of the distance from its center and not on the direction from
its center (i.e., gj(r) ∝ e−ζj |r−r j |2), we are free to rotate the
coordinate axes so that the center is on the z axis, whence xj
and yj become 0 and zj becomes rj. Assuming rj > 0, Eq. (B3)
becomes

2. Functions with general angular momenta

For basis functions of general angular momenta, assuming

The integration can be carried out analytically if we restrict
our interest to linear molecules. Doing this, and assuming that
all nuclei (i.e., basis function centers) are positioned on the z
axis (so that xj = yj = 0 and rj = |zj | for all j), Eq. (B6)

[72] The scattering by a nonpolar molecule with a center of sym-
metry can be described as s-wave scattering, as long as the
mixing between the positron s and d waves can be neglected,
i.e., for k Ra (cid:28) 1, where Ra is the radius of the target.
[73] Recall Levinson’s theorem [75] which relates the value of the
phase shift δ0(k) at zero momentum to the number of bound
states, δ0(0) = Ns π, given that δ0(k) → 0 for k → ∞.

are closed for all positron energies.
