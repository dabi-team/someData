PION PRODUCTION IN 𝜈𝜇 CHARGE CURRENT
INTERACTIONS ON 40𝐴𝑟 IN DEEP UNDERGROUND
NEUTRINO EXPERIMENT

Understanding pion generation and the consequences of final state interactions (FSI) is crit-
ical for data processing in all neutrino experiments. The energy utilised in modern neutrino
research, the resonance (RES) generation process contributes significantly to pion production.
If a pion is absorbed in the nuclear matter after it is produced, the event may become unrecog-
nizable from a quasi-elastic (QE) scattering process and act as a background. For oscillation
experiments, estimating this background is critical, and it necessitates solid theoretical models
for both pion generation at the primary vertex and after FSI. The number of final state pions
created differs greatly from the number produced at the primary vertex due to FSI. Because neu-
trino detectors can only detect final state particles, FSI obscures the proper information about
particles created at the primary vertex. A detailed study of FSI is required to overcome this
problem, which theoretical models incorporated in Monte Carlo (MC) neutrino event genera-
tors can provide. They provide theoretical results of neutrino interactions for diverse research,
acting as a connection among both theoretical models and experimental data. In this paper, we
provide simulated events for pion creation in 𝜈𝜇 charge current (CC) interactions on a 40Ar
target in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) experimental setup for two
distinct MC generators-GENIE and NuWro. In comparison to GENIE (v-3.00.06), NuWro
(v-19.02.2) is more opaque (less responsive) to charge exchange and absorption processes;
pions are more likely to be absorbed than produced during intranuclear transport.

1. Introduction

Neutrino physics is reaching a precise era, powered
by new experiments and contemporary detector tech-
nology, and this necessitates a better theoretical and
phenomenological explanation of neutrino interac-
tions. Neutrinos rarely interact with matter and can
move rapidly without interacting with it. The proper-
ties of neutrinos are yet unknown, making their study
difficult from both a theoretical and an experimental
standpoint. The neutrino interactions are described

by the Standard Model (SM)’s electroweak theory.
SM assumed the neutrino was a massless particle in
its previous formulation, hence mass mixing was not
expected, unlike quarks. If neutrinos had mass, mass
mixing would be possible in the lepton sector, and a
neutrino generated in one flavour could later be seen
as a neutrino of some other flavour, a phenomenon
known as neutrino oscillations. The masslessness
of neutrinos is not required by any fundamental
physics principle. The Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-
Sakata (PMNS) matrix [1] defines the strength of
mass mixing in the leptonic sector. Three mixing an-

gles (𝜃12, 𝜃23, 𝜃13), and the CP phase factor (𝛿𝐶𝑃 ) can
be used to represent PMNS. Apart from these mass
mixing factors, the probability of neutrino oscillation
is determined by the mass of neutrinos (or the differ-
ence of their squares), i.e. Δ𝑚2

Understanding CC neutrino-nucleus interactions in
the few GeV energy region is critical for current
and future neutrino experiments. However, under-
standing neutrino-nucleus cross-sections, modelling of
hadronization and intranuclear hadron transport, de-
scription of nuclear models, and nuclear effects in this
energy region is difficult and requires many interme-
diate steps. For this, we will need a conventional MC
generator that can account for all of these phases.
GENIE [2], ANIS [3], NuWro [4], GiBUU [5], MAR-
LEY [6], NEUT [7], and Nuance [8] are some of the
MC generators are devoted to the modeling of neu-
trino interactions. All of these generators have the
same assumptions. Each generator considers primary
and final state neutrino interactions individually.

GENIE and NuWro generators are used in this
study to simulate pion generation in neutrino-nucleus
interactions. Pions are a common backdrop [9] in so
many oscillation studies and their processes in FSI
[10] make them theoretically problematic. DUNE
flux has been used for interactions on the 40𝐴𝑟 target
in both GENIE and NuWro. Only the CC interac-
tions were analysed for each generator. Quasi-elastic
(QE) scattering, deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), res-
onance (RES) production, and coherent (COH) pion
generation were enabled processes. After that, the
data was examined for different pion topologies be-
fore (primary interactions) and after final state in-
teractions (secondary interactions). Understanding
neutrino-nucleus interactions are critical for current
experiments like T2K [11] and NOvA [12] as well
as upcoming long-baseline neutrino-oscillation exper-
iments like DUNE [13–15] and Hyper-KamioKande
[16].

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE) is a global initiative to build a long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermi National Ac-
celerator Laboratory (FNAL) in the United States.
It has a Near Detector (ND) located 575 metres from
the neutrino source and 60 metres underground [17]
at Fermilab in Illinois and a Far Detector (FD) lo-
cated approximately 1.5 kilometres underground at
Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in

2

South Dakota, is nearly 1300 kilometres away from
Fermilab. The primary scientific goals of this cutting-
edge detector are to conduct a thorough programme
of neutrino oscillation observations using Fermilab’s
𝜈𝜇 and ¯𝜈𝜇 beams, as well as to restrict the CP vio-
lation phase in the leptonic sector. Because the dis-
tance between FD and ND are approximately 1300
kilometres, it will give a 1300-kilometer baseline fa-
cility for studying matter effect. Both ND and FD
will observe the neutrino spectrum with Ar target
material, which will enable to overcome numerous
systematic uncertainties. The unoscillated neutrino
spectrum will be observed by ND, whereas the os-
cillated neutrino spectrum will be observed by FD.
The proportions and technology of the ND and FD
at DUNE will be different. The DUNE Near Detec-
tor is made up of three basic detector components,
two of which can travel off the beam axis: 1) A 50-
ton LArTPC (ND-LAr) with pixellated readout built
with ArgonCube. 2) The ND-GAr detector, which
consists of a high-pressure gaseous argon TPC en-
closed by an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) in
a 0.5 T magnetic field. 3) The System for on-Axis
Neutrino Detection (SAND), an on-axis beam moni-
tor that tracks neutrino flux. It comprises of a huge
solenoidal magnet with an inner tracker surround-
ing by an ECAL. In the current scenario, two inner
tracker methods are being considered: one using a
mix of plastic scintillator cubes and TPCs, and the
other using straw tubes.

The DUNE neutrino flux [18] in the range of en-
ergies 0.125-10 GeV was employed in our simulation.
Figure 1 depicts the 𝜈𝜇 and ¯𝜈𝜇 flux employed in our
simulations. It peaks at about 2.5 GeV and covers the
energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV.
The Neutrino at Main Injector (NuMI) beamline fa-
cility at Fermilab produces high purity, an intense,
wide-band neutrino beam with an initial output of
1.2 MW (which will be expanded to 2.4 MW) that
is estimated to produce 1.1 × 1021 protons each year.
The primary beam of protons from the main injec-
tor accelerator, with energies ranging from 60 to 120
GeV, collides with the graphite target, producing pi-
ons and kaons. With the help of magnetic horns,
these mesons will be focused even further toward a
200-meter-long decay pipe, in which they will break
into neutrinos and leptons. By reversing the polarity
of focussing magnets, the neutrino, and anti-neutrino
beams can be expelled individually.

The portions of this paper are as follows: The
pion generation in neutrino-nucleus interactions is
described in Section II. The processes of QE, RES,
DIS, and COH are explained in depth in this sec-
tion. Section III provides an overview of the GENIE
and NuWro MC generators, as well as the numerous
models that they employ. The simulation results are
presented in Section IV, followed by a summary and
conclusions in Section V.

2. Pion production in neutrino-nucleus
interactions

The most basic account of neutrino-nucleus interac-
tions consist of a description of neutrino-nucleus scat-
tering and a framework for nucleons in the nucleus.
Modeling neutrino-nucleus interactions are compli-
cated due to the need to combine many different
ideas. We will focus on neutrino-nucleus interactions
in the nuclear context. Generator-specific hadroniza-
tion process explanations and final state interaction
models are common.

In its simplest and most popular form (known
as the impulse approximation technique), neutrino-
nucleus scattering is defined as the incoherent sum
of scattering from unbound nucleons in the nu-
cleus. However, because nucleons in the nucleus are

ISSN 2071-0186. Ukr. J. Phys. ZZZZ. Vol. YY, No. XX

Neutrinos interact with matter through the ex-
change of 𝑊 ± and 𝑍 0 bosons. At low neutrino ener-
gies, the QE scattering process is favoured. As neu-
trino energy rises, RES and then DIS processes be-
come more important as seen in Figure 2 for both neu-
trino and anti-neutrino. Around 2.5 GeV, the DUNE
flux peaks and the RES and DIS cross-sections are
nearly similar at this energy. RES events can have
signals that are indistinguishable from DIS events in
a detector, which is a problem in practice. As a result,
it’s difficult to measure each stage separately.

In QE scattering, the target nucleon remains a sin-
gle nucleon in the final state, only changing its charge
in CC weak interactions. This scattering does not
make pions directly, but it can produce them through
final state interactions.
Inside the nuclear environ-
ment, hadrons can be spread elastically or inelasti-
cally, absorbed or charged exchanged, and even pro-
duce more pions. As a result, only a small percent-
age of events with no pions in the primary state is
expected to produce pions in the final state. For the
𝜈𝜇 beam, the CC QE scattering reaction is written
as:

𝜈𝜇 + 𝑛 −→ 𝜇− + 𝑝

(2)

Figure 3 illustrates how pions are produced in the
QE scattering process (left) and how a pion could be
absorbed (right) inside the nucleus during its intranu-
clear journey. The most prevalent processes that di-
rectly produce pions are DIS, RES, and COH. These
processes are depicted in Figure 4.

In RES scattering, resonances produce ions. In the
RES production process, a neutrino excites the tar-
get nucleon to a resonance state. The resonance state
that is formed quickly decays into a single nucleon and

When a pion created in a RES process is absorbed
in the nucleus, establishing whether the process is
RES becomes difficult. As a result, the staged event is
referred to as a fake event because it gives the appear-
ance of a separate procedure. The particles recorded
by the detector are like those formed at the primary
vertex in a specific interaction channel.

A high-energy neutrino penetrates deep into the
nucleon and scatters off a quark via the exchange
of 𝑊 ± and 𝑍 0 bosons, resulting in a lepton and a
hadronic system in the ultimate state of DIS. The
CC 𝜈𝜇 interaction process is as follows:

Neutrinos can interact coherently with the entire
nucleus, resulting in pion generation (coherent (COH)
pion production). The approach for CC 𝜈𝜇 interac-
tion is as follows:

nucleus in its final state, and 𝑚+=𝜋+, 𝑘+, 𝜌+....

3. Event Generators

Neutrino event generators are simulation tools used in
neutrino physics research, and they can be improved
utilising experimental data from past studies. Gen-
erators serve as a link between theoretical and ex-
perimental frameworks. GENIE (Generates Events
for Neutrino Interaction Experiments) and NuWro
are the two neutrino event generators employed in
this study (developed by Wroclaw University).
In
our simulations, we employed GENIE version 3.00.06
and NuWro version 19.01, which are the most recent
stable releases.

3.1. GENIE

Cross-section models, hadronization models, and nu-
clear physics models are the three types of physics
models employed in GENIE. Charged-current quasi-
elastic scattering is described for cross-sections us-
ing the Llewellyn-Smith model [21] and the newest
BBBA07 form factors [22]. The Rein-Sehgal model
[23] was used to generate baryon resonances. The
Bodek and Yang model [24] is utilised for DIS inter-
actions, with low 𝑄2 modifications. For coherent pion
production interactions, the Rein-Sehgal model with
an updated PCAC formula [25] is utilised. The de-
fault AGKY model is used in the hadronization proce-
dure [26]. It provides a phenomenological description
of the low invariant mass region using Koba-Nielson-
Olsen (KNO) scaling [27], before progressively switch-
ing to the PYTHIA/JETSET model at higher masses,
with the transition being gradual and continuous. To
account for the effect of the nuclear environment, the
Fermi Gas model is employed, with modifications by
Bodek and Ritchie to add nucleon-nucleon interac-
tions. Factors such as Pauli blocking and discrep-
ancies in free nucleon and nuclear structural func-
tion functions are also taken into account. Intranu-

clear hadron transport is handled by the INTRANU-
CLEAR/hA model.

3.2. NuWro

QE events are simulated in NuWro using the
Llewellyn-Smith model with the most recent BBBA05
form-factors [28]. Only the Δ(1232) contribution is
based on the Rein-Sehgal model in RES, whereas the
remainder of the resonances are based on the Adler-
Rarita-Schwinger model [29]. Simulating coherent
pion production interactions is done using the Rein-
Sehgal model. This Rein-Sehgal model [25] is not
the same as the one used in RES. A cut on invariant
mass of W<1.4 GeV defines the RES zone. NuWro
describes DIS events using the Quark-Parton model
[30]. When W>1.6 GeV, the DIS contribution is en-
abled. The RES contribution is linearly turned off
as the DIS contribution is turned on in the area 1.4
GeV<W<1.6 GeV. NuWro employs a combination of
its hadronization model and the Bodek-Yang model.
The Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) model is used to
account for the impacts of the nuclear environment.

4. Results

We have generated 1 million similar sets of events
for both 𝜈𝜇 and ¯𝜈𝜇 GENIE and NuWro. For each
generator, the number of pions created in both pri-
mary and final states was determined event by event.
These simulated results are displayed in tables that
indicate the topologies of pion formed in the primary
and final states. The topology of the pions created in
primary neutrino-nucleus interactions is stored in a
primary state. A final state contains the topology of
the pions produced after any secondary interactions
(such as intra-atomic scattering or absorption) have
occurred. A description of the generators’ models and
physics choices has previously been provided for a fair
comparison of generators.

Table 1 shows the results of GENIE simulations for
1 million 𝜈𝜇 events and Table 2 for 1 million ¯𝜈𝜇 events

GeV/c2 and 𝑀 𝑅𝐸𝑆
𝐴 =1.12 GeV/c2. The occupancy
of primary and final state topologies is shown in the
tables. Figure 5 shows a comparative plot for primary
and final state pions in GENIE (left panel) for 𝜈𝜇 (top
left panel) and ¯𝜈𝜇 (bottom left panel).

of primary and final state topologies is shown in the
tables. Figure 5 shows a comparative plot for primary
and final state pions in NuWro (right panel) for 𝜈𝜇
(top right panel) and ¯𝜈𝜇 (bottom right panel).

In case of 𝜈𝜇, Tables 1 (GENIE) and 3 (NuWro)
illustrate that for two generators, there are consid-
erable differences in both primary and final state
topologies (i.e. the number of pions seen in primary
and final states). Figure 5 (top panel) provides plots
for each generator’s number of pions observed on an
event-by-event basis in the main and final states, re-
vealing the disparities. Frequently, these differences
are higher than statistical fluctuations. The number
of 𝜋+ observed in the final state corresponding to 𝜋0
in the primary state for GENIE is 7742, but the num-
ber for NuWro is 3748, a difference of more than 50%.
The number of 𝜋0 observed in the final state matching
𝜋+ in the primary state for GENIE is 45010, but the
figure for NuWro is 14875, which is a significant dif-
ference. The number of 𝜋− observed in the final state
equivalent 𝜋− in the primary stage for GENIE is 639,
whereas the figure for NuWro is 6581. The reason for
these discrepancies is that DUNE flux peaks near 2.5
GeV, but QE, RES, and DIS processes all contribute
significantly to the overall cross-section in this en-
ergy region. Although the models used to explain
these processes are commonly shared among genera-
tors, there are numerous differences in how each gen-
erator views the merging of relative impact in this
energy zone. When this effect is paired with other in-
put parameters, visible differences across models can
emerge.

In case of ¯𝜈𝜇, Tables 2 (GENIE) and 4 (NuWro)
illustrate that for two generators, there are consid-
erable differences in both primary and final state
topologies (i.e. the number of pions seen in primary
and final states). Figure 5 (bottom panel) provides
plots for each generator’s number of pions observed on
an event-by-event basis in the main and final states,
revealing the disparities. The number of 𝜋+ observed
in the final state corresponding to 𝜋0 in the primary
state for GENIE is 5932, but the number for NuWro
is 2960, a difference of more than 50%. The number
of 𝜋0 observed in the final state matching 𝜋− in the
primary state for GENIE is 55269, but the figure for
NuWro is 17674, which is a significant difference.

The final states of both generators have a higher
number of zero pion (0𝜋) topologies than the pri-
mary states, according to the tables in both the cases.
This means that pions can be absorbed more easily
than they can be created through intranuclear tran-
sit. Topologies with pions in the primary and final
states are more likely to be produced by RES and DIS
processes, whereas topologies with 0𝜋 in the primary
and final states are more likely to be produced by
QE processes. Furthermore, the generators’ topolo-
gies are almost identical. Changes in nuclear mod-
els and form-factor factors utilised in each generator
could explain the differences.

Using Tables 1 and 3 for 𝜈𝜇 and Tables 2 and 4
for ¯𝜈𝜇 illustrates the fraction of events with no pion
(0𝜋), exactly one pion (1𝜋), and more than one pion
(>1𝜋). Single pion production (1𝜋), however, is rec-
ommended in GENIE, whereas multiple pion produc-
tion is preferred in NuWro.

Using Tables 1 and 3, Table 5 illustrates the frac-
tion of events with no pion (0𝜋), exactly one pion
(1𝜋), and more than one pion (>1𝜋) in the case of
𝜈𝜇. Using Tables 2 and 4, Table 6 illustrates the frac-
tion of events with no pion (0𝜋), exactly one pion
(1𝜋), and more than one pion (>1𝜋) in the case of

mended in GENIE, whereas multiple pion production
is preferred in NuWro.

Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 reveal important information
about final-state interactions. To collect this data, we
produced a summary table (Table 6 for 𝜈𝜇 and Table
8 for ¯𝜈𝜇). The summary table depicts the topology-
changing effect of intranuclear hadron transit. Out of
all events having a certain primary state topology, we
present the fraction of occurrences with both primary
and final state topologies for each generator in this ta-
ble. In the first two rows, the nucleus is translucent.
These rows represent the percentage of occurrences
with 1𝜋 in the primary state that will still have 1𝜋 in

the final state. The pion formed in the primary vertex
is more likely to not re-interact, as we can see. The
effect of charge exchange is shown in the next three
rows, while the fraction of pions absorbed is shown in
the following rows. NuWro’s current version (v19.01)
is significantly more transparent than GENIE’s cur-
rent version (v3.00.06). This could be due to a gener-
ator’s sensitivity to absorption and charge exchange
processes (NuWro may have too little, whereas GE-
NIE may have too much). Despite these differences,
given the complicated nature of final-state interac-
tions, one could argue that the agreement is still good.
The results of the analysed MC generators are very

cause single pion events make up the majority of the
background in neutrino oscillation investigations.

In this paper, we look at the effect of final state con-

versions of the GENIE and NuWro generators were
used as simulation tools. Despite having comparable
sets of models, two generators can have differing pion
production results in the primary and final states, as
seen in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4. This could be because
the two generators implement models and other in-
put parameters differently. Both generators show es-

sentially equal impacts of final state interactions on
pions during their intranuclear trip after being pro-
duced at the primary vertex. This is seen in Tables
5 and 6. As demonstrated in Figure 5, final state in-
teractions cause a difference between pions observed
in the detector (final state pions) and pions created
at the primary vertex (pions in the primary state)
In addition, Tables 1, 2, 3. and 4 reveal that both
generators have more 0𝜋 topologies in the final state

more likely to be absorbed than formed during their
intranuclear transit.

Our findings suggest that the ideal method for a
neutrino oscillation experiment like DUNE is to have
authentic correctness of nuclear models used in neu-
trino event generators employed for simulation, which
necessitate the use of a canonical neutrino event gen-
erator. Understanding nuclear consequences necessi-
tates a thorough understanding of hadronic physics
of neutrino-nucleus interactions.
