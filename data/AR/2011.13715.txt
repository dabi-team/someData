Introduction

We consider only nonempty simple graphs. Let G be such a graph, the vertex and edge set

of G is denoted by V (G) and E(G), the number of vertices and edges in G by ν(G) and e(G),

respectively. We denote the neighborhood of v in G by NG(v), and the degree of a vertex v in G

by dG(v), the size of NG(v). Let U1, U2 be vertex sets, denote by eG(U1, U2) the number of edges

between U1 and U2 in G. We write d(v) instead of dG(v), N (v) instead of NG(v) and e(U1, U2)

instead of eG(U1, U2) if the underlying graph G is clear.

Notice that Theorem 2 conﬁrms Conjecture 1 for the case when r = 3.

A subgraph of an edge-colored graph is rainbow, if all of its edges have diﬀerent colors. For

graphs G and H, the anti-Ramsey number ar(G, H) is the maximum number of colors in an edge-

colored G with no rainbow copy of H. Erdős, Simonovits and Sós [6] ﬁrst studied the anti-Ramsey

number in the case when the host graph G is a complete graph Kn and showed the close relationship

between it and the Turán number. In this paper, we consider the anti-Ramsey number of C multi

4

in

the complete 3-partite graphs.

3 The anti-Ramsey number of C multi

4

In this section, we study the anti-Ramsey number of C multi

4

in the complete 3-partite graphs.

Given an edge-coloring c of G, we denote the color of an edge e by c(e). For a subgraph H of

9

G, we denote C(H) =

e
c(e)
|
{

. We call a spanning subgraph of an edge-colored graph
E(H)
}

∈

representing subgraph, if it contains exactly one edge of each color.

Given graphs G1 and G2, we use G1

∧

G2 to denote the graph consisting of G1 and G2 which

intersect in exactly one common vertex. We call a multipartite C6 in a 3-partite graph non-cyclic

if there exists a vertex v in C6 such that the two neigborhoods in C6 of v belong to the same part.

Let

F

be a graph family which consists of C multi

4

(see graph G1 in Figure 4), C3

G2 in Figure 4), the non-cyclic C multi

6

(see graphs G3, G4 in Figure 4) and C3

C3 (see graph

C5 (see graphs

which contains at least two vertex-disjoint non-multipartite

The following lemma will help us to ﬁnd a rainbow C multi

graphs and the idea comes from [1].

Proof. We separate the proof into three cases.

Case 1. An edge-colored Kn1,n2,n3 contains a rainbow copy of G2, G3 or G4.

Suppose there is a rainbow copy of G2 in Kn1,n2,n3, See Figure 5, then whatever the color of

v1w2 is, at least one of v1uv2w2v1 and v1w2uw1v1 is a rainbow C multi

. Similarly, with the help of

the red edge that showed in G3 and G4, see Figure 5, one can easily ﬁnd a rainbow copy of C multi

4

if there is a rainbow copy of G3 or G4.

Case 2. An edge-colored Kn1,n2,n3 contains a rainbow copy of G5.

Suppose there is a rainbow copy of G5 in Kn1,n2,n3, see Figure 6. If v3w3uw2v3 is not rainbow,

then uw3 shares the same color with one of v3w3, v3w2 and uw2. Hence, uv2w3u

uv1w2u is a

rainbow copy of G2, by Case 1, we can ﬁnd a rainbow copy of C multi

then u2w1 shares the same color with one of v2u1, u1w1 and u2v2. Hence, v1u1v3w2u2w1v1 is a

11

rainbow copy of G4, by Case 1, we can ﬁnd a rainbow copy of C multi

4

. Similarly, with the help of

the red edge showed in G7 and G8, see Figure 7, one can always ﬁnd a rainbow copy of C multi

4

if

there is a rainbow copy of G7 or G8.

Now we are able to prove Theorem 3.

Proof of Theorem 3. Lower bound: We color the edges of Kn1,n2,n3 as follows. First, color all

edges between V1 and V2 rainbow. Second, for each vertex v

V3, color all the edges between v

∈

and V1 with one new distinct color. Finally, we assign a new color to all edges between V2 and V3.

In such way, we use exactly n1n2 + n3 + 1 colors, and there is no rainbow C multi

4

.

Upper bound: We prove the upper bound by induction on n1 + n2 + n3. By Theorem 1, we

have ar(Kn1,n2,1, C multi

4

)

ex(Kn1,n2,1, C multi

4

≤

) = n1n2 + 2, the conclusion holds for n3 = 1. Let

n3

≥

2, suppose the conclusion holds for all integers less than n1 + n2 + n3. We suppose there exists

an (n1n2 + n3 + 2)-edge-coloring c of Kn1,n2,n3 such that there is no rainbow C multi

4

in it. We take

a representing subgraph G.

Claim 1. G contains two vertex-disjoint triangles.

Proof of Claim 1. By Theorem 2, ex(Kn1,n2,n3,

C3, C multi

n1n2 + n3 + 2 and G contains no C multi
