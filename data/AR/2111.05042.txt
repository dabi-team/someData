The NA61/SHINE strong interaction programme aims to explore the phase diagram of the
strongly interacting matter. The main physics goals are the study of the onset of deconﬁnement
and the search for the critical point of the strongly interacting matter. These goals are pursued by
performing a scan in beam momentum (13A – 158A GeV/c) and size of colliding system (p+p,
p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb).
This contribution presents new results on system size and energy dependence of multiplicity and
net-charge ﬂuctuations measured with higher-order moments of these distributions. Also, new
results on the measurement of Bose-Einstein correlations in nucleus-nucleus collisions based on
Levy sources are discussed as well as news on anisotropic ﬂow in Pb+Pb interactions at 13A
GeV/c.

Fluctuations and correlations at NA61/SHINE

Maja Ma´ckowiak-Pawłowska

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE [1, 2] at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is a ﬁxed-target experiment
pursuing a rich physics program including measurements for strong interactions, neutrino, and
cosmic ray physics.

The strong interactions program focuses on search for the critical point (CP) and study of the
onset of deconﬁnement (OD) of strongly interacting matter. NA61/SHINE is the ﬁrst experiment
to perform a two-dimensional scan, in beam momentum (13A – 150/158A GeV/c) and size of
colliding system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). It aims to explore the phase diagram
of the strongly interacting matter. The illustration of the scan as well as list of gathered and planed
system/energies are shown in Fig. 1.

This contribution discusses new results on ﬂuctuation and correlations measured in p+p, Be+Be,

Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb interactions.

2. Study of the onset of deconﬁnement

Spatial asymmetry of the initial energy density in the overlapping region of the colliding rel-
ativistic nuclei is converted, via interactions between produced particles, to the asymmetry of mo-
mentum distribution of particles in the ﬁnal state. The resulting asymmetry carries information
about the transport properties of the QCD matter created during the collision. Asymmetry is usu-
ally quantiﬁed with vn coefﬁcients in a Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal distribution of
produced particles relative to the reaction plane. The NA61/SHINE has an unique way to estimate
the reaction plane with the Projectile Spectator Detector (for details see Refs. [3, 4]).

The energy dependence of ﬂow coefﬁcients is of particular importance. At the energies of
SPS and Beam Energy Scan Program at RHIC it is expected that the slope of proton directed ﬂow
at mid-rapidity, dv1/dy, changes its sign [5, 6, 7]. Directed ﬂow of π − and p as well as dv1/dy
(centrality dependence) for Pb+Pb collisions at 13A and 30A GeV/c is presented in Fig. 2. Shapes
of v1(pT ) for protons and negatively charged pions (Fig. 2, left) are different. v1(pT ) of protons is
positive in the entire pT range. Directed ﬂow of negatively charged pions starts with negative values

and than changes sign (Fig. 2, center). There is also a clear difference of the v1 slope between 13A
and 30A GeV/c (Fig. 2, center and right).

Statistical uncertainty was obtained with the bootstrap method and it is indicated as a dashed black bar. Sys-
tematic uncertainty/bias: p+p - corrected data with estimate on systematic uncertainty; Be+Be - uncorrected
data with estimate of systematic bias. Systematic uncertainty/bias is indicated with a green bar.

The expected signal of a critical point (CP) is a non-monotonic dependence of various ﬂuctu-
ation/correlation measures in NA61/SHINE energy – system size scan. Special interest is devoted
to ﬂuctuations of conserved charges (electric, strangeness or baryon number) [9, 10].

In order to compare ﬂuctuations in systems of different sizes, one should use intensive quan-
tities, i.e. quantities insensitive to system volume. Such quantities are constructed by division
of cumulants κi of the measured distribution (up to fourth order), where i is the order of the cu-
mulant. For second, third and fourth order cumulants intensive quantities are deﬁned as: κ2/κ1,
κ3/κ2 and κ4/κ2. Their reference values for multiplicity ﬂuctuations are 0 (no ﬂuctuations) and
1 (independent particle production). In case of net-charge, ratios are redeﬁned to κ2/κ1[h+ − h−],
κ3/κ1[h+ − h−] and κ4/κ2[h+ − h−] in order to keep the same reference.

Figures 3 and 4 show the system size and energy dependence of second, third and fourth order
cumulant ratio (or its intensive equivalent) of net-electric charge and negatively charged hadron
multiplicity in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc interactions. So far, there is no clear difference between
systems of different sizes except in case of κ2/κ1[h−] of p+p and Ar+Sc interactions. More detailed
studies are needed.

Establishing a baseline is also an important part of the CP search. Preliminary results on rapid-
sNN = 17.3 GeV
ity dependence on net-charge and multiplicity ﬂuctuations in p+p interactions at
are presented in Fig. 5 top (constant bins) and bottom (widening bins). Results are compared with
EPOS1.99 [12, 13]. It reproduces net-charge rapidity dependence but it underestimates signal in
case of h−.

At the CP, the spatial correlation function becomes a power-law ∼ r−(d−2+η), where d repre-
sents the number of dimensions. One can predict a critical exponent η (related to spatial correla-
tions) for the QCD universality class, which is the 3D-Ising model for QCD [19, 20]. The predicted

value of η at the CP is 0.03631 [21]. For the random ﬁeld 3D Ising η = 0.50 ± 0.05 [22]. In the
HBT analysis the momentum correlation function C(q) of produced particles is directly related to
the normalized source distribution S(r) via C(q) = 1 + (| ˜S|)2, where ˜S is the Fourier transformation
of S(r). The data analysis was done by using a Levy distributed source function [23]. Since, it leads
to the same power-law tails, the Levy exponent α was assumed to be identical to the spatial correla-
tion exponent η [24]. In the vicinity of the critical point, α values around 0.5 may be expected and
this can be measured by investigating the Bose-Einstein correlation function C(q) = 1 + λ e−(qR)α .
Figure 6 shows measured values of α parameter for pion pairs (π −π −, π +π + and π −π − + π +π +)
in 20% most central Be+Be collisions at 150A GeV/c.

All measured combinations (see Fig. 6) indicate 1 < α < 2 which is far from the CP value.
In addition to the CP, α values lower than 2 can be caused by anomalous diffusion, QCD fractal
structured jet fragmentation, and also to some extend by the averaging over broad event class (e.g.
centrality) [25, 26, 27, 28].

4. Summary

In this contribution new results on ﬂuctuations and correlations from the NA61/SHINE ex-
periment were discussed. Directed ﬂow v1 is measured relative to the spectator plane in Pb+Pb
collisions at 13A GeV/c for p and π − and compared to results in Pb+Pb at 30A GeV/c. We observe
strong centrality dependence of directed ﬂow for negatively charged pions. v1(pT ) of π − changes
sign at pT ∼ 1 GeV/c. The slope of v1(y) for pions (negative slope) have different sign compared to
the one observed for protons (positive slope) in the speciﬁc centrality range. Multiplicity and net-
charge ﬂuctuations measured by higher order cumulant ratios were compared for different system
sizes and energies. Net-charge results are comparable between systems but there is a difference in
κ2/κ1[h−] for p+p and Ar+Sc collisions. The reference measurements on net-charge and multiplic-
ity ﬂuctuations in p+p as a function of rapidity were also reported. EPOS1.99 describes the data
except the multiplicity ﬂuctuations, where the description is qualitative only. Value of α parameter
of HBT analysis is between 1 and 2 in Be+Be at 150A GeV/c interactions possibly due to anoma-
lous diffusion or other phenomena. In general, presented experimental results show no indications

of the critical point. In order to qualitatively measure the CP signal, the background phenomena as
well as remaining analysis should be studied in details.
