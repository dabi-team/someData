200 nm thick SiO2 layers grown on Si substrates and Ge ions of 150 keV energy were implanted 

into SiO2 matrix with two fluences  of 2.5×1016 and 7.5×1016 ions/cm2. The implanted samples 

were annealed at 950o C for 30 minutes in Ar ambience. Topographical studies of implanted as 

well as annealed samples were captured by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Two dimension 

(2D)  multifractal  detrended  fluctuation  analysis  (MFDFA)  based  on  the  partition  function 

approach  has  been  used  to  study  the  surfaces  of  ion  implanted  and  annealed  samples.  The 

partition  function  is  used  to  calculate  generalized  Hurst  exponent  with  the  segment  size. 

Moreover,  it  is  seen  that  the  generalized  Hurst  exponents  vary  nonlinearly  with  the  moment, 

thereby  exhibiting  the  multifractal  nature.  The  multifractality  of  surface  is  pronounced  after 

annealing for the surface implanted with fluence 7.5×1016 ions/cm2.

1. Introduction: 

Semiconducting  quantum  dots  (QDs)  embedded  in  a  thin  film  dielectric  matrix  have 

significant  technological  applications  in  various fields  such  as  electronics,  optoelectronics,  and 

photonics. Due to their unusual characteristic QDs can be incorporated in semiconductor devices 

like  light  emitting  diodes  [1],  lasers  [2],  and  field  effect  transistors  [3].  Ge  nanocrystals 

embedded in dielectric materials have been widely considered for charge storage in nanocrystals 

gate memories in non-volatile memory devices [4]. 

In particular the ion implantation is a favourable technique, because of precise control over depth 

and concentration distribution of implanted ions [5, 6]. It also suggests massive flexibility in the 

QD  formation  by  control  of  the  process  parameters  like  thermodynamical  limitations,  and 

extreme chemical purity for the synthesis of isotope pure Ge QDs [7].  

Surface  plays  a  significant  role  in  various  physical  processes  and  different  fields  of 

modern  day  science  and  technology.  It  illustrates  rough  behaviour  on  nano-scale,  so  its 

characterization is very important [8]. For this purpose scaling law analysis is highly needed. The 

most  common  scaling  is  referred  as  self-affine  scaling  which  is  reminiscent  of  fractal.  The 

progress of fractal and multifractal theory opens new ways of understanding image analysis [9]. 

Fractal  is  characterized  by  single  scaling  exponent  while  multifractal  is  generalization  of  such 

concept. The traditional multifractal analysis (MFA) is limited to stationary object measurements 

but cannot deal with those that are nonstationary. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has 

been  developed  to  solve  this  inability  which  eliminates  a  certain  trends  hidden  in  the 

characterizing  object  [10].  The  performance  of  the  DFA  was  proved  superior  to  the  wavelet 

method  when  dealing  with  the  nonstationary  multifractal  measure  [11].  Both  DFA  and  its 

multifractal version (MF-DFA) [12] have been used to resolve various nonstationary time series 

Page 2 of 12 

 
in many research fields such as nature of flame images [13], texture representation [14], tumor 

recognition  in  magnetic  resonance  images  [15],  and  thin  films  images  [8,16].  Multifractal 

analysis can help to understand the relationship between material structure and its properties. 

The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  report  the  multifractal  analysis  of  Ge  quantum  dots  embedded  into 

SiO2 matrix by ion implantation method with varying fluences. Effect of annealing is discussed 

on multifractal properties of implanted Ge quantum dots into SiO2 matrix. 

2.  Experimental methods: 

Ge ions of 150 keV energy were implanted at room temperature into thermally grown SiO2 

layers  with  varying  fluences  from  2.5×1016  to  7.5×1016  ions/cm2.  Annealing  of  implanted 

samples were done at 950˚ C for 30 minutes in Ar atmosphere for defect removal induced by ion 

implantation. Surface morphology was studied with Nanoscope IIIA for atomic force microscopy 

(AFM) measurements in tapping mode and digitalized into

 pixels. 

3.  Results and discussion:  

Fig.1 (a, c) shows the surface morphological AFM images of a SiO2 film on a Si substrate 

implanted with 150 keV, Ge ions at fluences of 2.5×1016 before and after annealing and Fig. 1 (b, 

d) shows for the fluence of 7.5×1016 ions/cm2 before and after annealing. These images are of the

.  The  surface  properties  are  affected  with  surface  roughness  at  nano-meter 

scale;  hence,  its  characterization  is  very  necessary.  Classically,  it  is  characterized  by  average 

roughness  (

aR )  and  interface  width  ( w ).

aR   is  described  as  the  estimated  value  of  the  surface 

relative  to  the  plane  of  the  surface  and  is  given  by

implanted SiO2 surfaces before and after annealing are listed in Table I and II.

From  Table  I,  it  is  clear  that  the  roughness  values  are  increased  with  implantation  while 

decreasing  nature  is  observed  after  annealing  in  Table  II.  These  parameters  are  global 

characterizations  of  roughness  and  sensitive  only  to  peak  and  valley  values  of  surface 

fluctuations,  missing  the  information  about  correlation  and  irregularity/  complexity  about  the 

surface.

It is observed that surface height fluctuation often show self-affine properties [16]. A self-affine 

surface behaves like a fractal. Therefore, fractal  analysis is needed for characterization of such 

surfaces.  

The height-height correlation function or power spectral gives only the information about 

the  fractal  property  of  surface,  which  is  a  single  exponent  and  is  not  enough  to  describe  the 

dynamics  of  the  surface  [8].  To  explore  the  multifractal  nature  of  the  Ge  ion  implanted  SiO2 

surfaces  before  and  after  annealing,  we  applied  the  multifractal  detrended  fluctuation  analysis 

(MFDFA).  It  is  a  powerful  tool  for  detection  of  surface  multifractlity  [9].  The  detail 

mathematical technique of MFDFA formalism is described in Ref. [8]. When MFDFA is used to 

investigate  the  multifractal  scaling  of  object  fluctuations,  the  method  can  assume  partition 

function  which  can  appear  in  double  log  plot  of  the  fluctuation  function

Fig. 2.

The perfect fall of data points on straight lines are indicating the better choice of  q values and the 

surface under inspection have self-affine nature. For the larger value of 

7>q

significant power 

law  scaling  is  not  observed  or  the  scale  invariant  behavior  is  destroyed  beyond

7>q

.  We 

plotted the graph between 

)(qh

and  q  for each  surface before  and after  annealing  as shown in 

Figs.  3(a)  and  3(b).  Here,  it  is  seen  that 

)(qh

is  a  nonlinear  decreasing  function  of  q   for  each 

surface.  In  Fig.  3(b),  a  greater  nonlinearity  is  observed  for  the  surface  implanted  with  ions

7.5×1016  ions/cm2  after  annealing.    The  nonlinear  behavior  of  the  surface  suggested  that  the 

surface  under  investigation  have  multifractal  nature.  Therefore,  nonlinearity  is  the  hallmark  of 

presence  of  multifractality.  In  addition,  if 

)(qh

is  q dependent  then  surface  is  considered  as 

multifractal; if not, it is monofractal. For positive  q values, 

)(qh

yields more stable results. It is 

found that the multifractality is enhanced after annealing. 

The singularity strength,

(αf

is computed by using 

the relation:

These parameters are very important for characterization of multifractal surfaces. The measured 

values of these before and after annealing are listed in Table  I and  II. The multifractal spectra, 

the  graphs  between

(αf
)

versus 

)(qα are  shown  in  Figs.  4(a)  and  4(b).    Before  annealing  the 

shape of multifractal spectrum is shown as bell shaped, indicates that the height fluctuations of 

surface  is  closed  [Fig.  4(a)]  while  transfer  to  left  hooked  after  annealing,  depicts  that  height 

fluctuations  are  varied  [Fig.  4(b)].  The  width  of  the  multifractal  spectrum  ( α∆ )  is  defined  by

multifractality,  increased  roughness,  coarser  surface  distribution,  and  increased  non-uniformity 

of  the  height  probabilities  of  surface.  Here,

4.  Conclusion: 

AFM is used to capture the images of a SiO2 film on a Si substrate implanted with 150 keV 

Ge  ions  at  a  fluences  of  2.5×1016  and  7.5×1016  ions/cm2  before  and  after  annealing.  Two 

dimension  (2D)  multifractal  detrended  fluctuation  analysis  (MFDFA)  is  applied  to  investigate 

the  multifractality  of  each  surface  and  found  that  each  surface  have  multifractal  nature.  A 

nonlinear  variation  of  generalized  Hurst  exponent  with  moment  is  the  hallmark  of  presence  of 

multifractality.    Before  annealing  the  shape  of  multifractal  spectrum  is  shown  as  bell  shaped, 

indicates  that  the  height  fluctuations  of  surface  is  closed,  while  transfer  to  left  hooked  after

and f∆ ) is noted  for surface implanted  with ions  7.5×1016 ions/cm2 after  annealing.  The  larger 

value  of  α∆ suggested  the  greater  multifractality,  increased  roughness,  coarser  surface 

distribution, and increased non-uniformity of the height probabilities of surface.
