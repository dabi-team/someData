Abstract. The reﬂection, refraction, and transmission of large-scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves (collectively, secondary
waves) have been observed during their interactions with coronal structures such as active regions (ARs) and coronal holes
(CHs). However, the eﬀect of the total reﬂection of EUV waves has not been reported in the literature. Here, we present the
ﬁrst unambiguous observational evidence of the total reﬂection of a quasi-periodic EUV wave train during its interaction with a
polar CH. The event occurred in NOAA AR 12473, located close to the southeast limb of the solar disk, and was characterized
by a jet-like CME. In this study, we focus in particular on the driving mechanism s of the quasi-periodic wave train and the total
reﬂection eﬀect at the CH boundary. We ﬁnd that the periods of the incident and the reﬂected wave trains are both about 100
seconds. The excitation of the quasi-periodic wave train was possibly due to the intermittent energy release in the associated
ﬂare since its period is similar to that of the quasi-periodic pulsations in the associated ﬂare. Our observational results showed
that the reﬂection of the wave train at the boundary of the CH was a total reﬂection because the measured incidence and critical
angles satisfy the theory of total reﬂection, i.e., the incidence angle is less than the critical angle.

1. Introduction

As a fundamental physical phenomenon, waves of any kind can
infer the physical parameters of the medium supporting them
and hence provide a condition for diagnosing coronal physical
parameters such as the magnetic ﬁeld strength through seismol-
ogy diagnostics techniques. The coronal seismology proposed
by Uchida (1970); Roberts et al. (1984) is one of the most crit-
ical techniques to estimate the magnetic–ﬁeld strength of the
solar corona, especially in the absence of direct approaches.
This technique, based on the MHD waves and the oscillations
in the corona, has been widely used in many articles (e.g., Liu
et al., 2011, 2012b; Shen et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2021).

Coronal waves, a ubiquitous phenomenon in the solar at-
mosphere, was ﬁrstly discovered by the Extreme-Ultraviolet
(EUV) Imaging Telescope (EIT: Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995)
onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO:
Domingo et al., 1995) and always accompanied with energetic
eruptions such as ﬂares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (e.g.,
Vrˇsnak & Luli´c, 2000a,b). In on-disk observations, these dis-
turbances always appear as a circular or semicircular wave-
front globally propagating through the solar corona (Moses
et al., 1997; Thompson et al., 1998). They often have a life-
time ranging from 2 to 70 minutes and are characterized by
radial propagating motion with speeds of 200-1500 km s−1
(Nitta et al., 2013). These EUV waves are strongly consid-

ered to be driven by the CME. Nonetheless, without a related
CME, some observations indicated that there are some EUV
waves closely associated with the ﬂares (Kumar et al., 2016;
Kumar & Innes, 2015). Early observations indicated that most
of the EUV waves are single-pulse, diﬀuse wavefronts extend-
ing across a signiﬁcant fraction of the solar corona. However,
more detailed information on these waves have been detected
by the high spatio-temporal resolution Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) telescope onboard Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell et al., 2012). These new
features, such as the bimodal composition with both wave and
non-wave components (Zhukov & Auch`ere, 2004; Patsourakos
& Vourlidas, 2012; Zong & Dai, 2017), let their physical in-
terpretations to a converged view, i.e., a fast-mode magne-
tosonic wave component travels ahead of a non-wave com-
ponent. These bimodal compositions have been predicted in
the 2D MHD model (e.g., Chen et al., 2002). The 3D global
MHD simulations further conﬁrm this bimodal composition of
an outer, faster-mode magnetosonic wave component and an in-
ner, CME compression front (e.g., Cohen et al., 2009; Downs
et al., 2012). More convincing evidence comes from the oﬀ-
limb events that a faster EUV wavefront separates from a CME
ﬂank and propagate freely on the solar surface once the CME
has propagated suﬃciently away from the Sun (Ma et al., 2011;
Chen & Wu, 2011; Shen & Liu, 2012b; Shen et al., 2013, 2014;

Zhou et al.: Total reﬂection of a ﬂare-driven quasi-periodic EUV wave train at a coronal hole boundary

Zhou et al., 2021), resulting in a bifurcation structure in time-
distance stack plots.

Recently, a new type of EUV wave train with multiple
wavefronts propagating across the solar surface has been re-
ported only in sporadic cases (Liu et al., 2012a; Kumar et al.,
2017; Shen et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2021). According to the
statistic by Shen et al. (2021), these EUV wave trains travel
away from the ﬂare kernel with speeds ranging from 370–1100
km s−1 and with a period in the range of 36–240 seconds.
Considering that the amplitude and velocity of these waves are
not within the range of quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP)
wave trains channeled in the open- or closed-loops but are sim-
ilar to the classical EUV wave, thus Shen et al. (2021) classify
these wave trains as broad wave trains and QFP wave trains
as a narrow wave train. Otherwise, they can excite the oscilla-
tion of the cavity and ﬁlament, which are also widely observed
in the classical EUV waves. About the driving mechanism of
the quasi-periodic EUV wave train, there are several possible
interpretations, such as driven by CME downward and lateral
compression (Liu et al., 2012a) or unwinding motion of the ﬁla-
ment helical structures (Shen et al., 2019). This divergence may
be caused by the limitation of the observational case resulting
in that it is hard to study the driving mechanism s detailedly
and comprehensively. For detailed discussions about these two
types of wave trains, we refer to the recent review by Shen et al.
(2021)

The true wave characteristics, such as refractions, reﬂec-
tions, and transmissions, have manifested in the observations
and simulations when a wave interact with the region exhibit-
ing a sudden density drop, such as CHs (Veronig et al., 2006;
Schmidt & Ofman, 2010; Shen & Liu, 2012a; Olmedo et al.,
2012; Kumar et al., 2016, 2017; Liu et al., 2018) and ARs
(Ofman & Thompson, 2002; Shen et al., 2013; Miao et al.,
2019). The reﬂection evidence of an EUV wave at the bound-
ary even have been observed in the radio dynamic spectra
(Mancuso et al., 2021). However, the total reﬂection, a ba-
sic phenomenon in wave theory, in an EUV wave has not yet
been identiﬁed or detected. Recently, Piantschitsch & Terradas
(2021) used an extended theoretical approach, based on a linear
theory treating EUV waves as fast-mode MHD waves, to in-
vestigate geometrical properties of secondary waves caused by
the interaction between the oblique incoming waves and CHs.
Their results show that the second waves’ geometrical prop-
erties depend on the incidence angle of the incoming waves
to the CH boundaries and the plasma density contrasts ρc be-
tween the inside and outside CHs. It allows us to determine
whether the secondary waves are partial or total reﬂected waves
at the CH boundaries. In this letter, for the ﬁrst time, we report
the direct observational evidence of the total reﬂection that oc-
curred on 2015 December 22, in which an EUV wave train
emanated from the ﬂare kernel and was totally reﬂected by a
remote southern polar CH. The present study focus on the driv-
ing mechanism of the EUV wave train, its propagation, and its
interaction with CH. The used observational data are described
in Section 2; results are presented in Section 3; discussions and
conclusions are given in Section 4.

2. Observations and data Reduction

The present event was recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al., 2012) onboard the Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO). During our observing time in-
terval, AIA/SDO provided continuous full-disk observations
of the solar chromosphere and corona in seven extreme ul-
traviolet (EUV) channels, spanning a temperature range from
approximately 2 × 104 Kelvin to over 2 × 107 Kelvin. Here,
we mainly use the 171 Å (Fe ix; characteristic temperature:
0.6 × 106 K), 193 Å (Fe xii, xxiv; characteristic temperature:
1.6 × 106, 2 × 107K) and 211 Å (Fe xiv; characteristic temper-
ature: 2 × 106 K) images, since the evolutional processes are
observed in these three cooler passbands, but is completely ab-
sent in the other AIA channels. The time cadence and pixel
size of AIA images are 12 second and 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. All
of the AIA images used here were calibrated with the stan-
dard procedure available in the SolarSoftWare package pro-
vided by the instrumental team. The Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) soft X-ray 0.5–4.0 Å and 1.0–
8.0 Å ﬂux are used to analyze the periodicity pulsation of the
ﬂare. In addition, Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph
(LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) images are used to portray
the associated CME. To enhance the moving feature of the
wave front, we utilized the running-diﬀerence images (i.e.,
each image is subtracted by the previous one) to study the
wave trains’ evolution. To visualize the obtained signatures of
the wave train, we performed the wavelet analysis (Torrence &
Compo, 1998) method to investigate the periodicity of the wave
train and ﬂare. We perform the Diﬀerential Emission Measure
(DEM) analysis using the inversion code developed by Hannah
& Kontar (2012) to estimated the plasma density inside and
outside CH. The DEM inversion was done at 03:22 UT be-
fore the incident wave trains arrived the CH boundary ten min-
utes. Additionally, we used the Collection of Analysis Tools for
Coronal Holes (CATCH) algorithm developed by Heinemann
et al. (2019) to extract the CH boundary, which applies the in-
tensity gradient along the CH boundary to modulated the ex-
traction threshold.

3. Results

The event occurred close to the eastern solar limb on 2015
December 22 from the NOAA AR 12473, which associated
with an M 1.6 solar ﬂare, whose start, peak, and end times were
at about 03:15 UT, 03:34 UT, and 03:48 UT, respectively (see
Fig. 1(e)). In addition, a jet-like CME with an average speed
of 260 km s−1 is observed by the LASCO/C2 during the erup-
tion (see Fig. 1(d)).1An overview of the eruption source region
is presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b), in which there was a large
southern polar CH, whose boundary determined by using the
CATCH soft are also indicated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 (a) and
(b1). The CHs regions always manifest as dark structures in the
EUV and X-ray emission in comparison to the peripheral so-
lar corona because of the reduction of density and temperature
caused by plasma depletion in these regions (e.g., Heinemann
et al., 2019). During the rising phase of the ﬂare, a EUV wave

train, signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the classic EIT wave that ex-
hibits as a single large-scale quasi-circular propagating front,
emanated from the ﬂare kernel and interacted with the dis-
tant coronal hole. More distinction between the EUV and EIT
waves see a discussion in the reviews by Zhukov (2011) and
Liu & Ofman (2014). Recent investigation indicated that the
temperature distribution of the CH has a dominant component
centered around 0.9 MK and a secondary smaller component at
1.5–2.0 MK (Saqri et al., 2020). In the AR, there exited some
closed and open loops as shown in Fig. 1(c).

3.1. Kinematics of the Large-Scale quasi-periodic

EUV Wave train

We mainly analyzed the time sequence of 193 Å running-
diﬀerence images taken during the ﬂare to show the overall
evolutionary and interactional process, since the evolutionary
process are similar in 171 Å and 211 Å images (see the anima-
tion available in the Electronic Supplementary Material). The
violent eruption launched multiple striking arc-shaped wave-
fronts running along the solar surface. Fig. 2 displays the se-
lected running-diﬀerence images in those 193 Å images show-
ing the multiple successive wavefronts during the impulsive
phase. The ﬁrst wavefront appeared at about 03:22 UT, which
was about 7 minutes delay the onset of the ﬂare. Following
the ﬁrst wavefront, at least three successive wavefronts have
been detected and these wavefronts are also clearly seen in
171 Å and 211 Å running-diﬀerence images, suggesting that
the responsible plasma was in the range of this three chan-
nels’ peak response temperature of 0.6–2.0 MK. If we care-
fully observe the animation and Fig. 2, we can ﬁnd that the
intensity of the wavefronts progressively decreases as the prop-
agation distance increases. After arriving at the CH boundary,
they showed a signiﬁcant reﬂection feature. The deﬂection is
with respect to the initial propagation direction (and it would be
around 90◦ indeed, see the animation available in the Electronic
Supplementary Material and Fig. 2 (d)–(f)).

To reveal the speeds of the wave train, we selected the sec-
tors S1 and S2 as shown in Fig. 1(b) in the AIA 211 Å chan-
nels. Sectors S1 (width 20◦) and S2 (width 8◦) were placed
respectively over the incident and reﬂected wave trains’ tracks,
and they are selected in almost the exact directions of the cor-
responding wave trains. The time-distance stack plots are dis-
played in Fig. 3, in which one can identify that the incident and
reﬂected wave train propagated at speeds of 730 km s−1 and
560 km s−1, respectively. Obviously, the wave train’s speeds
are close to that of classical EUV waves whereas signiﬁcantly
lower than that of the QFP wave train (around 2000 km s−1
reported by Liu et al. (2011)). This may reﬂect the diﬀerence
of the fast magnetosonic speed in the quiet-Sun (as shown in
the present paper) and in funnel-like magnetic structures stem-
ming from active regions (as reported by Liu et al. (2011)).
Therefore, the wave train under investigation in this paper
should be classiﬁed as a broad wave train, according to the
classiﬁcation of Shen et al. (2021). We estimated the error
from making the ﬁt ten times by placing two points along the
front and deriving the average velocity (Olmedo et al., 2012).

Fig. 1. Overview of the event. Panels (a), (b) and (d) are AIA
171 Å AIA 211 Å and LASCO/C2 snapshots, respectively. The
FOV of the panel (c) is marked by the white box in panel (a).
The incident and reﬂected wave trains are tracked with the two
sectors indicated as S1 and S2 and the green line mark the loca-
tion of the CH boundary in panel (b). Panel (e) shows the solar
soft X-ray recorded by the GOES in 0.5–4.0 (red) and 1.0–8.0
(blue) Å. The green region marks the start and end time of the
ﬂare in NOAA AR 12473.

It is worth noting that only the ﬁrst strongest wavefront can be
tracked from the erupting origin to the CH boundary, and no
signiﬁcant wave signal that the wavefront intrudes into the CH
as reported by (Veronig et al., 2006). The ﬁrst wavefront en-
countered the CH boundary at about 3:32 UT (see the black
arrow in Fig. 3 (a)). Almost at the same time, the ﬁrst reﬂected
wavefront appeared (see the black arrow in Fig. 3(e)), followed
by a series of wavefronts at the time-distance stack plot. The
trailing wavefronts are so weak that it is not discernable from
the time-distance stack plots in Fig. 3 after propagation of about
200 Mm but can be discerned in the animation. From the time-
distance stack plots, there is no signiﬁcant signal of a reﬂected
wave train in the AIA 211 Å channel, indicating the energy dis-
sipation of the wave train as its impingement and long-distance
propagation.

To analyze the origin of the EUV wave train, we applied
the Morlet wavelet analysis (Torrence & Compo, 1998) to an-
alyze the periodicities of the associated impulsive M 1.6 ﬂare
and the wave train. Since RHESSI had a data gap during the
ﬂare, thus temporal-derivative of GOES soft X-ray 0.5–4.0 Å
and 1.0–8.0 Å ﬂuxes as a proxy of the corresponding hard X-
rays are used to analyze the periodicity of the ﬂare accord-

ing to the Neupert eﬀect (Neupert, 1968; Veronig et al., 2005;
Ning & Cao, 2010). Fig. 4(a1) displays GOES 0.5–4.0 Å soft
X-ray ﬂux. Its temporal-derivative curve (black) is shown in
Fig. 4(a2). After subtracting a 100 seconds smoothed curve
(red) of the temporal-derivative curve, we get the detrended
signal, and the result is overlaid in Fig. 4(a3) (see the yel-
low curve). Using the same method, we obtain the detrended,
temporal-derivative curve of GOES 1.0–8.0 Å and the result
is overlaid in Fig. 4(a4). Using such a detrended temporal-
derivative curve as input, we could see that the period of ﬂare
is about 100 seconds (see Fig. 4(a3)–(a4)).

— For the periodicities of the wave train, we analyzed
the intensity proﬁle extracted along the white horizontal lines
marked “L1” and “L2” as shown in Fig. 3. Using its detrended
intensity proﬁles as input, we obtained that the average peri-
ods of the incident and reﬂected wave trains are 84–110 sec-
onds and 88–105 seconds (average values are 98 seconds and
97 seconds), respectively (see Fig. 4(c1) and (c2)). This result
satisﬁes the characteristics of a true wave, i.e., the frequency
of wave trains does not change during propagating process or
interaction with other structures. From the wavelet analysis re-
sults, one can ﬁnd that the period of the wave train is simi-
lar to that of the pulsations in the ﬂare, suggesting that these
wave train were possibly initiated by the quasi-periodic pres-
sure pulses launched by the intermittent energy-releasing pro-
cess in the ﬂare. Interestingly, a sub-period remains seen in
Fig. 4 b1-b3 and c1 for both incident and reﬂected wave train.
The sub-period for the incident and reﬂected wave trains from
Fig 4 b1-b3 and c1 are 132, 80, 103, and 180 seconds. In ad-

dition, a typical feature of the signature is a bifurcation and an
inverse tadpole ( cf, Roberts et al. (1983, 1984); Nakariakov
et al. (2004) for the tadpole in wavelet spectrum) in the wavelet
spectrums, especially in Fig 4 b1-b3, and c2. This special shape
wavelet spectrum will be discussed in the next paper.

3.2. Total Reﬂection of the Quasi-Periodic EUV Wave

train

Like any true wave, the EUV waves will exhibit various behav-
iors when encountering the region of suddenly reduced plasma
density. In addition to the total reﬂection, all other true wave
features, such as partial reﬂections, refraction, and transmis-
sions, have been observed so far. This section will evidence
that the wave train was totally reﬂected by the CH boundary.

We moved and projected S1 and S2 on the disk center,
considering that the projection eﬀect on this limb event, as
shown in Fig. 5(a). Combining the incidence angle equals the
reﬂected angle (i.e., θi = θr) and the angle between the in-
cident and reﬂected wave trains (two red axes of the sectors
S1 and S2) is about 115◦, we arrive at the incidence angle,
θi, is about 33◦, as shown in the inset in the left upper cor-
ner of Fig. 5(a). According to Piantschitsch & Terradas (2021),
the critical angle, θc, depends only on the density contrast, i.e.,
θc = cos−1(
ρc), in which the ρc = ρi/ρo is the density con-
trast of inside and outside CH. To estimate the density con-
trast, we follow the method provided by Saqri et al. (2020)
to perform DEM analysis for the CH, and one of the exam-
ples is shown Fig. 5(b1). All of the AIA images used for DEM

which is in the range of 0 < θi < θp. This result further con-
ﬁrms that the incident wave train is total reﬂected at the CH
boundary.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

Using high spatio-temporal resolution imaging observations
from AIA/SDO, we have presented a rare observation of a se-
ries of wavefronts interaction with the southern polar CH that
occurred on 2015 December 22 in NOAA AR 12473. This
event is associated with an M1.6 ﬂare and a jet-like CME. The
wave train launched from the ﬂare kernel, propagated along the
solar surface, ﬁnally reﬂected at the CH boundary. The speeds
of the incident and reﬂected wave trains are 730 km s−1 and 560
km s−1, respectively. Their period is about 100 seconds, which
is similar to that of the pulsation ﬂare. Thus we propose that
the wave train was initiated by the intermittent energy-release
process in the ﬂare, at least in this event. The observed evolu-
tionary process together with the fact that the incidence angle is
less than the critical angle (i.e., θi < θc), suggests that the ﬂare-
initiated, quasi-periodic wave train was totally reﬂected at the
CH boundary.

It is worth noting that most of the studies revealed that the
EUV waves are tightly associated with CMEs, whereas the re-
lationship with ﬂares is very weak (e.g., Veronig et al., 2008,
2010; Liu et al., 2018; Downs et al., 2021). At the same time, a
considerable number of observational evidence show that these
waves always exhibit a single diﬀuse wavefront. Another fea-
ture is the appearance of multiple wavefronts in a single erup-
tion, which, however, had rarely been observed. According to
the statistics by Shen et al. (2021), there are only three EUV
wave trains have been published. These wave trains with mul-
tiple wavefronts, such as one propagating along the solar sur-
face in the current event, are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
narrow QFP magnetosonic wave trains (Liu et al., 2011). The
main dominant diﬀerence between the broad and narrow trains
is their propagating medium: the former runs along the solar
surface, whereas the latter is constrained in the closed- or open-
loops. The narrow QFP wave trains are mainly detected in the
AIA 171 Å and sometimes 193 Å wavelengths. In contrast, the
quasi-periodic EUV wave trains like the classical EUV waves
are visible in AIA 171 Å 193 Å and 211 Å wavelengths, sug-
gesting diﬀerent temperature ranges. More detailed informa-
tion about these two types of wave trains we can ﬁnd in a recent
review paper (Shen et al., 2021, and references therein). These
diﬀerence indicate that the observed wave train in the current
event is a rare quasi-periodic wave train. In the scenario of a
piston-driven shock, the wavefront should decouple from the
driver, resulting in a single wavefront propagating freely on the
solar surface. The single erupting jet-like CME as the driver
can not excite multiple successive wavefronts, indicating that
the observed EUV wave train was unlikely launched by the jet-
like CME. Since the similar period of the ﬂare pulsations and

diﬀerence images along the sectors S1 and S2 as shown in

were binned by 8 × 8 pixels to enhance the signal-noise ratio
and then further deconvolved with the instrument Point Spread
Function (PSF) provided by the aia calc psf.pro routine to re-
duce the eﬀect of instrument stray light. The plasma density
can be derived from the formula ¯ρ =
EM
h , where EM is the
integration result of the DEM over the temperature range, and
h is the column height (taken here as 42 Mm and 90 Mm for
CH and quiet-Sun region respectively, cf. Saqri et al. (2020);
Long et al. (2019)) of emitting plasma along the line of sight
. We selected ten successive segments along the CH boundary
near the waves-CH interaction location and estimated the den-
sities in the patches outward and inward of the CH boundary
of each individual segment. Fig. 5 (b2) shows that the plasma
density inside and outside of the CH boundary are in the range
of 1.5 − 2.0 × 108cm−3 and 2.5 − 3.0 × 108cm−3, respectively,
which are slightly lower than that reported by Saqri et al. (2020)
through studying the low-latitude CHs. This slight divergence
should be the result of the projection eﬀect. The density con-
trast for ten segments inside and outside CH are plotted in
Fig. 5(b3). From the density contrast distribution, one can ﬁnd
¯ρc is about 0.62. Based on
that the average density contrast
the critical angle θc = cos−1(
ρc) (Piantschitsch & Terradas,
2021), we get the critical angle θc is about 38◦, which is larger
than the incidence angle θi (33◦), suggesting that the incident
wave train was totally reﬂected at the CH boundary, resulting in

Fig. 4. Periodicity analysis for the wave train and the associated ﬂare pulsation. Panels (a1) and (a2) show the GOES 0.5–4.0
Å soft X-ray ﬂux and its temporal derivative (black curve in (a2)), respectively. The detrended intensity proﬁle (yellow curve in
panel (a3)) is obtained from the temporal derivative in (a2) by subtracting its smoothed intensity proﬁle (red curve in (a2)). The
smooth/detrended temporal derivative signal of the GOES 1.0–8.0 Å soft X-ray ﬂux is overlaid in panel (a4), while the yellow
curves in panel (b1)–(c2) are smooth/detrended intensity proﬁles of the horizontal white dashed lines labeled “L1” and “L2” in
Fig. 3, and their corresponding wave wavelet power spectrums are displayed in each panel. The cross-hatched regions in panels
(a3)-(c2) indicate the cone of inﬂuence region due to the edge eﬀect of the data, while the dotted and red horizontal dashed lines
separately mark the 95% conﬁdence level and the period, respectively.

the wave train, we incline to the notion that it was initiated by
the quasi-periodic pressure pulses launched by the intermittent
energy-releasing process in the ﬂare. As we have already men-
tioned, EUV waves, characterized by a single wavefront, are
usually initiated by the CME and generally have a weak con-
nection with ﬂare. The present study showed strong evidence
that EUV waves can also be excited impulsively by the quasi-
periodicity of ﬂare and appear multiple wavefronts. Recently,
Zhou et al. (2021) reported a similar example, i.e., multiple
consecutive wavefronts were propagating continuously inside
a CME bubble that had already completed developmental com-
pletion. This event is also hard to explain using the CME ex-
pansion. The appearance of the ﬁrst wavefront in present event
has a delay of several minutes compared with the onset time of
the ﬂare. A possible explanation is that the wave needs time to
build up a large amplitude or shock to be observed.

Observational studies of the interaction of the EUV waves
with the CHs are scarce, but the appearance of the secondary
waves is found to be a pretty frequent phenomenon when the
waves interact with CHs or ARs (Wang, 2000; Gopalswamy
et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2019). These observational ﬁndings
were veriﬁed by numerical simulation (Piantschitsch et al.,
2017, 2018a,b; Afanasyev & Zhukov, 2018). In accordance
with these observational and simulation wave-like features con-
ﬁdently conﬁrm the interpretation that it is a fast-mode magne-
tohydrodynamic (MHD) wave. However, as we have already

mentioned, the total reﬂected wave train is a basic behavior
of waves, has hardly ever been observed in the solar corona.
Studying the wave-CH interaction and its secondary waves can
provide much information about the CHs themselves, partic-
ularly their boundaries. Because of that, (i) the observed CH
areas are well correlated with the solar wind speed measured
in situ at 1 AU, which is of crucial importance parameters for
Space Weather forecasting models. (ii), accurate extraction of
the boundaries of the CHs is the premise of investigating the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld encompassed by the CH region,
which strongly correlated with the CH area (Heinemann et al.,
2018b,a). As depicted in the Fig. 5 inset, the incidence angle
is about 33◦. Using the method provided by Piantschitsch &
Terradas (2021), we get the critical angle of the wave train was
about 38◦, which is signiﬁcantly large than the incidence angle,
providing strong evidence that the incident wave train was in-
deed totally reﬂected by the southern polar CH. Recently, based
on a few statistical studies, it has been shown that the density
contrast to the CH boundary is in the range of 0.1-0.6 (Saqri
et al., 2020; Heinemann et al., 2019) and the corresponding
critical angle θc is in the range of 39◦ − 72◦ (Piantschitsch &
Terradas, 2021). This more representative statistical result fur-
ther proves that the wave train is totally reﬂected at the CH
boundary since it is larger than the incidence angle θi in the
current event.

full-disk images of green contour represent the CH boundary extracted with the CATCH, and the sectors located on the central
disk show the S1 and S2 translation and projection results. (b1) shows the plasma total emission measure (EM) at the 1.2-1.4 MK
temperature range. Twenty patches were selected to estimate the density contrast surrounding the CH boundary, of which ten are
inside the CH, and ten are outside the CH. The green and red lines in panel (b2) show the density inside and outside of the CH,
respectively. (b3) shows the plasma density contrast over the inside and outside CH regions.

The wave-CH interactions allow us to study the inﬂuence
of the CH on wave parameters, such as the velocity and the
amplitude (Muhr et al., 2010; Olmedo et al., 2012; Liu et al.,
2018; Hu et al., 2019). The observed secondary wave signals
are usually weak, resulting in the parameters of the measured
secondary waves being relatively rough and of low quality.
Therefore, studying more clearly captured examples of wave-
CH interactions can help us deepen our understanding of the
inﬂuence of coronal holes on coronal waves and get more in-
formation about the CHs.
