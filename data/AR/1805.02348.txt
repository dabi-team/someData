ABSTRACT
Using the HMI/SDO vector magnetic ﬁeld observations, we studied the relation of degree of magnetic non-
potentiality with the observed ﬂare/CME in active regions. From a sample of 77 ﬂare/CME cases, we found a
general relation that degree of non-potentiality is positively correlated with the ﬂare strength and the associated
CME speeds. Since the magnetic ﬂux in the ﬂare-ribbon area is more related to the reconnection, we trace
the strong gradient polarity inversion line (SGPIL), Schrijver’s R value manually along the ﬂare-ribbon extent.
Manually detected SGPIL length and R values show higher correlation with the ﬂare strength and CME speed
than the automatically traced values without ﬂare-ribbon information. It highlights the difﬁculty of predicting
the ﬂare strength and CME speed a priori from the pre-ﬂare magnetograms used in ﬂare prediction models.
Although the total, potential magnetic energy proxies show weak positive correlation, the decrease in free en-
ergy exhibits higher correlation (0.56) with the ﬂare strength and CME speed. Moreover, the eruptive ﬂares
have threshold of SGPIL length (31Mm), R value (1.6 × 1019Mx), free-energy decrease (2 × 1031erg) compared
to conﬁned ones. In 90% eruptive ﬂares, the decay-index curve is steeper reaching ncrit = 1.5 within 42Mm,
whereas it is beyond 42Mm in > 70% conﬁned ﬂares. While indicating the improved statistics in the predic-
tive capability of the AR eruptive behaviour with the ﬂare-ribbon information, our study provides threshold
magnetic properties for a ﬂare to be eruptive.

1. INTRODUCTION
The energetic events like ﬂares and coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) generally occur in magnetically concentrated loca-
tions called active regions (ARs).
It is believed that these
events are physically related to magnetic complexity and non-
potentiality of ARs. However, the question of how the mag-
netic complexity and non-potentiality trigger the ﬂares and
CMEs remains to be unknown. For this reason, solar ﬂare
forecasting models mainly depend on statistical relationship
between the ﬂare production and the non-potential magnetic
parameters characterizing the AR size, strength, morphology,
magnetic topology etc. Conventionally, the magnetic com-
plexity and non-potentiality are described with parameters
such as the magnetic shear (Hagyard & Rabin 1986; Wang
et al. 1994a), the horizontal gradient of longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld (Zirin & Wang 1993; Tian et al. 2002), the electric cur-
rent (Leka et al. 1993; Wang et al. 1994b), twist parameter
α (Pevtsov et al. 1994; Hagino & Sakurai 2004; Tiwari et al.
2009), magnetic free energy (Metcalf et al. 2005), current he-
licity (Abramenko et al. 1996; Zhang & Bao 1999) etc. Al-
though individual cases have identiﬁed a direct role of these
non-potential parameters in the observed activity (Vemareddy
et al. 2012), their relationship is not quite strong enough in
statistically signiﬁcant sample of ﬂare/CME and hence for the
prediction of space-weather.

Past observational studies have explored the connection
between photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and solar ﬂares, sup-
porting the claim that solar ﬂares are driven by the non-
potentiality of magnetic ﬁelds in ARs (Leka et al. 1993; Wang
et al. 1994b, 1996; Tian et al. 2002; Abramenko 2005). Sev-
eral observations have revealed that solar ﬂares often occur

near polarity inversion lines (PILs) with high gradient of lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁelds and/or strong shear of transverse
components (Hagyard et al. 1990; Wang et al. 1994a; Fal-
coner et al. 1997; Kosovichev & Zharkova 2001; Jing et al.
2006; Schrijver 2007). Because of this fact, the magnetic
shear, magnetic gradient and the vertical electric currents in
the photosphere are the most commonly used measures of the
magnetic non-potentiality.

Both gradient and shear have been employed as parame-
ters in solar activity forecast models. For example, in a sam-
ple of 17 vector magnetograms, Falconer (2001) and Fal-
coner et al. (2003) measured the lengths of strong-sheared
and strong-gradient magnetic neutral line segments, respec-
tively. Their study found that strong-sheared, strong-gradient
PIL segments are strongly correlated with each other, sug-
gesting them to be prospective predictors of the CME pro-
ductivity of ARs. Leka & Barnes (2003a,b) investigated the
magnitudes and temporal variations of several photospheric
magnetic parameters in three ARs. They demonstrated that
individually these parameters have little ability to differen-
tiate between ﬂare-producing and ﬂare-quiet regions, but in
certain combinations, two populations may be distinguished.
Song et al. (2006) showed that the strong-gradient polarity in-
version line length (SGPIL) is a viable tool to locate source
regions of either CMEs or ﬂares. The deﬁnitive ﬂare/CME
prediction ability by measuring SGPIL is about 75% (55 out
of 73 events). Based on a study of 298 ARs, Georgoulis &
Rust (2007) argued the connected magnetic ﬁeld as the ro-
bust metric to distinguish X- and M-ﬂaring regions from non-
ﬂaring ones. A further study by Song et al. (2009) proved
that SGPIL is the most promising parameter in determining
the solar ﬂares, if only one parameter had to choose. In com-
bination with PIL length, total unsigned ﬂux and the effec-
tive separation, Mason & Hoeksema (2010) introduced the

gradient-weighted PIL length as a characteristic for solar ﬂare
forecast, however the skill score test still indicates it is not a
reliable parameter for real-time predictor of ﬂares. However,
Sadykov & Kosovichev (2017) showed the importance of PIL
characteristics in the solar ﬂare forecasts.

Knowledge of the amount of magnetic free energy and its
temporal variation associated with ﬂares/CMEs is important
to understand the energy storage and release processes in
ARs. The deviation from potential energy is taken as a proxy
for magnetic free energy. Leka & Barnes (2007) considered
the total excess energy as one of the best performing param-
eters. Emslie et al. (2012) demonstrated for a sample of 38
ﬂares that the total magnetic free energy was sufﬁcient to ex-
plain the ﬂare energy release including CMEs, energetic par-
ticles, and hot plasma emission and dynamics. Studies on
the correlation between magnetic free energy estimated from
three-dimensional non-linear force-free ﬁelds (3D NLFFF)
and ﬂare index, conﬁrm the physical link between them (Jing
et al. 2010). Su et al. (2014) showed that in ﬂaring ARs, the
3D NLFFF magnetic free energy and the magnetic free en-
ergy obtained from photospheric magnetic ﬁelds have almost
equal predictability for ﬂares.

Motivated by the above studies, we further investigated the
relationship between non-potentiality of magnetic ﬁeld in sta-
tistically signiﬁcant source ARs and the observed ﬂare/CME
productivity using vector magnetograms. The central inter-
est of this study seeks to address the question that the degree
of non-potentiality has any correspondence with the magni-
tude of the ﬂares and the speed of the CMEs. Both ﬂares and
CMEs are magnetically driven phenomenon of stored mag-
netic energy conﬁguration and it is of great importance to dis-
tinguish the AR conditions that produce ﬂares and that lead
to a ﬂare become eruptive successfully ejecting material as a
CME. Note that coronal rain is also a kind of eruption but fail
to eject material. Seeking such a link of AR non-potential pa-
rameters to ﬂares in the begining and then to CMEs involves a
careful manual inspection of which CME comes from which
AR and the availability of vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements
within ±40◦ of disk center. Therefore, our study is limited
in sample compared to several studies based on line-of-sight
magnetograms as stated above. In section 2, we gave the brief
description about the observational data, and the procedures
used to calculate the several magnetic ﬁeld parameters. The
results of non-potential measures and their relation to ﬂares
and CMEs are discussed in section 3. The summary with dis-
cussion is presented in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND ANALYSIS

PROCEDURE
The required vector magnetic ﬁeld observations are
obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Schou et al. (2012)) aboard Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory (SDO). For ready use in AR analysis, HMI

contains ﬁeld components (Br, Bθ, Bφ)
in spherical co-
ordinate system after
the heliographic CEA projection
(Calabretta & Greisen 2002) centered on the AR patch.
These components are equivalent to (Bz, −By, Bx) in cartesian
system. More information on the HMI data pipeline and
the ﬁeld transformation is described in Hoeksema et al.
(2014); Sun (2013). The data on CME linear speed, ﬂare
initiation and end timings were obtained from relevant web-

active

et al. 2009), https://www.spaceweatherlive.com/en/archive,
http://xrt.cfa.harvard.edu/ﬂare_catalog/all.html.). For a sta-
tistically signiﬁcant inference, we considered 77 ﬂare events
during the period from February 2011 to July 2016 and their
source ARs are located within 40◦ of the central meridian to
minimize the projection effects on the calculation of magnetic
properties are shown in Figure 1. We also excluded the ﬂares
from inter-ARs (Toriumi et al. 2017) and/or not associated
with polarity inversion line. Thus, our sample constitutes
14 X-class, 42 M-class and 21 C-class ﬂares. Among the
sample, 38 ﬂares are associated with CMEs visible at least in
LASCO C2 ﬁeld-of-view. The procedures for the derivation
of various magnetic parameters are described as follows.

2.1. Strong gradient and Strong sheared PIL length
PILs mark the separation between positive and negative
magnetic ﬂux patches in the photosphere of the ARs. So-
lar ﬂares generally occur in the strong magnetic regions with
strong gradient polarity inversion lines, or in complex polar-
ity patterns.
In the past, several researchers measured the
PIL length and studied its relationship with ﬂare productivity
(Falconer et al. 2003; Bokenkamp 2007; Schrijver 2007; Jing
et al. 2006; Song et al. 2006; Mason & Hoeksema 2010). Bo-
kenkamp (2007) developed a three-step iterative algorithm to
measure the gradient-weighted polarity inversion line lengths,
originally based on the Falconer et al. (2003) method. In the
ﬁrst step, zero gauss contours are identiﬁed in the strongly
smoothed line of sight magnetic ﬁeld( Blos) map and the
vector magnetic ﬁeld map is calculated from the smoothed
Blos using linear force-free ﬁeld model (Alissandrakis 1981).
From the output of this step, PIL segments are identiﬁed as
zero Gauss contours with speciﬁc thresholds of simulated po-
tential transverse ﬁeld and horizontal gradient of Blos.
In
the second step, the above process is repeated for the less
smoothed Blos image and the output PIL segments are iden-
tiﬁed by comparing it with PIL segments obtained with this
step and the previous one. Finally, in the third step, the same
process is repeated for the unsmoothed Blos and the gradient
weighted PIL length is obtained by comparing the segment
outputs from this step and the previous step. Here in our
study, we employed a single step algorithm to measure the
Strong Gradient polarity inversion line (SGPIL) and Strong
shear polarity inversion line (SSPIL) lengths based on Bo-
kenkamp’s algorithm. These PILs are deﬁned in the following
paragraphs.

Non-potential nature of magnetic ﬁeld is characterized by
magnetic shear as the difference between directions of ob-
served transverse ﬁelds (Bo) and potential transverse ﬁelds
(Bp) and is given by, θ = cos−1(Bo · Bp/|BoBp|) (Ambastha
et al. 1993; Wang et al. 1994a). The PIL segment on which
the observed transverse ﬁeld has strength above the threshold
value of 150G and magnetic shear angle has exceeding value
of 45◦ is marked as SSPIL (Falconer et al. 2003; Vemareddy
et al. 2015). We measured the SSPILs automatically (SSPILA)
and also manually (SSPILM). Our algorithm (automatic) iden-
tiﬁes multiple strong shear PILs in an AR and sum of these
PIL lengths gives SSPILA. In this procedure, we smoothed
the vertical magnetic ﬁeld (Br) image to a smoothing factor of
8 pixels(4 arcseconds) and identiﬁed the zero gauss contour.
Then potential magnetic ﬁeld is calculated from the strongly
smoothed magnetogram and thereby shear map is generated
from the computed potential transverse ﬁeld and the observed
transverse ﬁeld. On applying the thresholds of strong ob-
served transverse ﬁeld, Bt (> 300G) and strong shear angle

(> 45◦) to contour segments, strong ﬁeld and strong shear
PILs are identiﬁed. The summation of these PILs lengths
gives SSPILA.

In the case of vector magnetograms are not available, the
shear information alternatively obtained by horizontal gradi-
ents in line-of-sight magnetograms where the SGPIL serves
the purpose of SSPIL (Falconer et al. 2003). In this proce-
dure (automatic), we identiﬁed the zero gauss contours on
smoothed magnetogram. Then potential magnetic ﬁeld and
vertical magnetic ﬁeld gradient maps were generated by the
strongly smoothed magnetogram. Using a threshold of po-
tential transverse ﬁeld ( > 300G) and high- vertical magnetic
ﬁeld gradient (> 50 G/Mm) to the zero Gauss contour seg-
ments, SGPILA is determined.

To illustrate this procedure, we display AR NOAA 11429
in Figure 2. The panel 2(a) shows ﬂare ribbons in the AIA
1600Å snapshot taken during GOES soft X-ray peak time
(2012-03-07 00:24 UT) of ﬂare X5.4 from AR 11429. The
brightening region indicates the ﬂare occurring site. These
ﬂare ribbons generally trace SGPIL/SSPIL with some de-

panel 2(c), we traced automatically the SGPILA marked by
blue curve on gradient map of Bz. This difference slightly
increases depending on the complexity of ARs. It can be no-
ticed that both SGPILA and SSPILA traces the same segments
of PIL and measures a length with slight difference. A simi-
lar trace is obtained with SSPILA as shown in shear map of
panel 2(d). The SSPILA also follows the ﬂare brightening
region to a large extent with differences at the middle.
In
panel 2(e), we overplotted SGPILA (blue curve) on Bz map
and the SSPILA (blue) is overlayed on vector magnetogram in
panel 2(f).

Owing to differences

in automatically traced SG-
PIL/SSPILs with the actual extent of ﬂare ribbons during
peak time, we undertook an experiment by following these
PIL segments manually with the ﬂare ribbon informations.
Different from automated procedure, the manual tracing is
biased by the ﬂare brightening area which overlaps with
the SSPIL/SGPIL. In this way, we extract only the strong
shear/gradient PIL segment which majorly contributes to
the ﬂare brightening. The underlying idea to invoke the
information of ﬂare brightening is that the ﬂux along the
extent of ﬂare ribbon contributes to strength of the ﬂare but
not all PIL segments with strong shear/gradient contributes
to the ﬂare intensity. We refer the total length of all these
manually traced segments as SSPILM and SGPILM.
In
future,
this manual method can be easily automated (for
few cases) as well by applying brightness threshold to AIA
1600 Å images and use as mask for HMI magnetograms.
However, we are constrained to manually trace these PILs for
the reasons of picking peak phase of the ﬂare and verifying
the ribbons extent along the PIL instead on either side. This
procedure is presently subjective to human errors and may
not reproduce the same values.

2.2. Magnetic ﬂux
The total absolute ﬂux in the AR is computed by Φ =
Σ|Bz|dA, where dA is the area of observation pixel. The emer-
gence of electric current embedded in magnetic ﬂux plays a
main role in triggering the ﬂares (Leka et al. 1996; Schri-
jver et al. 2005; Vemareddy et al. 2015). As SGPIL being
the proxy for such emerging photospheric electric currents,
the ﬂux near to SGPILs, deﬁned by R, must have strong re-

lation with the ﬂares as ﬁrst proposed by Schrijver (2007).
Following the procedure prescribed in Schrijver (2007), we
constructed the binary maps of positive and negative strong-
ﬁeld masks with the threshold value of +300 G and -300 G re-
spectively (Guerra et al. 2018), then these maps were dilated
by a 6 × 6 square pixel kernel to create dilated positive and
negative bitmaps. Regions of overlap of these two bitmaps
were identiﬁed as PILs. Then this region of overlap is con-
volved with normalized Gaussian of FWHM 15Mm to create
the weighting map. Finally, this weighting map is multiplied
by the absolute value of magnetogram(Bz) and the weighted
unsigned ﬂux density integrated over all pixels gives the value
of R. RSG is measured similarly along the SGPILM segments.
Note that R and RSG differ by ﬂare brightening information.
One such example is shown in Figure 3.

2.3. Magnetic energy
The total energy in the coronal ﬁeld is estimated using virial
theorem equation provided the magnetic ﬁeld observations at
the photospheric surface (Chandrasekhar 1961; Molodensky
1974; Low 1982) and is given by

E =

1
4π

(cid:90)

S

(xBx + yBy)Bzdxdy

(1)

The use of this equation at the solar photosphere is re-
stricted because the photosphere ﬁeld is not fully force-free
and not precisely ﬂux-balanced in a ﬁnite area surrounding
the AR of interest. Therefore, the photospheric energy esti-
mate serves only as proxy to the energy content in the AR
magnetic structure. The potential magnetic ﬁelds are derived
from the Bz component by using the Fourier transform method
(Gary 1989). Since the potential ﬁeld state is a minimum en-
ergy state, by subtracting potential energy (Ep) from the total
energy (E) one obtains the upper limit of the free energy (E f )
available in the AR to account for energetic events likes ﬂares
and CMEs.

dex n(z), considered as the important parameter in controlling

the eruptiveness of an AR. In the ﬂux rope based CME models
(Török & Kliem 2005; Olmedo & Zhang 2010; Cheng et al.
2011), if the decay index of overlying magnetic ﬁeld reaches
a critical value, then it results in torus instability (rapid decay-
ing of overlying magnetic ﬁelds), which leads to CME erup-
tion.

The decay index is deﬁned as, n(z) = − z
Bh

∂Bh
∂z , where z is the
geometrical height from the bottom boundary (photosphere)
and Bh(=
y) is the horizontal ﬁeld strength. We com-
puted the background ﬁeld in the entire volume of AR mag-
netic structure by potential ﬁeld approximation (Gary 1989)

using the observed vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld
at the photosphere. From this extrapolated ﬁeld, the Bh as a
function of height is obtained at eight points along the main
PIL and an average of n(z) is then derived. Török & Kliem
(2005) proposed a constant value of 1.5 as a critical decay
index (ncrit), and is a subjective value based on different con-
ditions. The height at which the n-curve reaches the ncrit of
1.5 is considered as critical height. We estimated this critical
height for all the events in our sample.

SGPILA with the ﬂare strength. As our algorithm identiﬁes
multiple PIL segments of high gradient and strong shear in
an AR and their summation SGPILA and SSPILA respectively
shows weak correlation with the ﬂare strength at a Spearman’s
rank correlation coefﬁcient ∼0.4. As we are keen to ﬁnd the
correlation between the ﬂare strength and PIL segment of high
gradient and strong shear in the ﬂare brightening region, we
traced SGPILM and SSPILM manually as described in the Sec-
tion 2.1.

Here and in the following studies, linear regression analy-
sis is done by using FITEXY.PRO routine available in So-
larSoftWare library, where it uses least-square approxima-
tion in one-dimension to ﬁt the best straight line to the data
with errors in both coordinates. We used standard devia-
tion of both coordinates as error inputs. The uncertainties
in both the obtained coefﬁcients are shown in the equation,
which are inserted in their respective ﬁgure panels. We es-
timated the Spearman ranking correlation coefﬁcients (r) in
all our studies and the standard error in r is estimated by
((1 − r2)/(n − 2)). From here onwards, we refer
ERRr =
Spearman ranking correlation coefﬁcient as correlation coef-
ﬁcient (CC).

In Figures 4(c & d), the SGPILM and SSPILM are plot-
ted against the ﬂare strength, respectively.
It can be seen
that the length of both SGPILM and SSPILM increase with

occur from ARs having larger PILs weighted by strong ver-
tical ﬁeld gradients, a proxy for strong shear. ARs with
large PILs are indicative of complex ﬁeld structure, and PILs
with large gradients are indicative of shearing. Therefore, the
SGPIL and SSPIL both describe the global non-potentiality
of ARs. SGPILM has relatively better correlation with the
ﬂare strength at a CC of 0.87 than that of SSPILM with ﬂare
strength at a CC of 0.78. These strong correlations with ﬂare
strength conﬁrms that the ﬂare productivity depends on the
non-potentiality of ARs.
Importantly, it is noted that the
35 out of 38 CME associated cases (red symbols) have SG-
PIL length larger than a threshold of Log10(SGPIL) = 1.5
(31Mm). This may indicates that the CME occurrence re-
quires a certain minimum SGPIL length for being eruptive
from conﬁned environment.

The above relation is tested for statistical signiﬁcance. Con-
tingency table for Log(SGPILM) ≥ 1.5 and CME productivity
from all the ﬂaring ARs (both conﬁned and eruptive) in our
sample is constructed and shown in Table 1. Fisher’s exact test
is applied to check for the signiﬁcance of relationship between
these two variables. P-value is determined by using hyper ge-
ometric distribution and its value is found to be 2.9×10−4,
which is statistically signiﬁcant. This relation is not signif-
icant for SGPILA, as we can see there is no clear threshold
value for distinguishing the conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares. Fur-
ther, this threshold value of SGPILM is used as forecasting pa-
rameter for CME productivity. Forecast veriﬁcation measures
like True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score(HSS)
were calculated using the forecast contingency table (Bloom-
ﬁeld et al. 2012) as shown in Table 1. Both of these mea-
sures account for the correct random forecasts and can have
the range of skill scores from -1 to +1. TSS and HSS were
found to be 0.357 and 0.355 respectively.

Further,

the estimated length of the SSPILM is plotted
against that of SGPILM (plot is not shown). They are highly
correlated at a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.92. Our result in
a large sample is consistent with Wang et al. (2006), who

Summing the absolute values of Bz at these pixels gives RSG.

High vertical ﬁeld gradient and strong shear usually ap-
pear in the vicinities of PILs, where ﬂares frequently occur
(Hagyard & Rabin 1986; Hagyard 1988; Falconer et al. 2003;
Sharykin et al. 2016). Following the procedure described in
Section 2.1, we estimated the lengths of both SSPIL and SG-
PIL for all the sample ﬂaring ARs by automatically called as
SSPILA & SGPILA and manually as SSPILM & SGPILM re-
spectively. In this regard, we used vector magnetograms avail-
able immediately before the initiation time of the ﬂares. In
Figures 4(a & b), we showed the relationship of SSPILA and

showed a strong correlation between magnetic gradient and
magnetic shear in primary PILs of ﬁve strong ﬂaring ARs.
This high correlation is not a surprise as Falconer et al. (2003)
already indicated that SGPIL is a viable proxy for SSPIL and
it is well correlated with the CME productivity of ARs. As
SGPIL can be measured from line-of-sight magnetogram, it
serves as a substitute for SSPIL in CME/ﬂare forecasting stud-
ies.

3.2. Total unsigned ﬂux, Magnetic energy versus Flare

strength

In the past many studies conducted on the association of
ﬂares and the ﬂux content of ARs (Leka & Barnes 2003a,b;
Schrijver 2007; Bobra & Couvidat 2015; Kazachenko et al.

total unsigned ﬂux of whole AR with the ﬂare strength. Re-

ribbon area with the ﬂare strength. In the same line, we con-
ducted three different studies to ﬁnd the relationship between
ﬂares and the total unsigned ﬂux quantitatively. Firstly, the
total unsigned ﬂux (Φ) of whole AR, secondly Schrijver’s R
value which is the total unsigned ﬂux within 15Mm of all SG-
PILs in the AR and thirdly the RSG (similar to the ﬂare rib-
bon reconnection ﬂux as deﬁned in Kazachenko et al. 2017),
which is the total unsigned ﬂux within 15Mm of SGPILM
In Figure 5a, the to-
but the only the ﬂare ribbon extent.
tal unsigned ﬂux from the whole AR is plotted against the
ﬂare strength and shows a weak correlation of CC∼0.31 .
In Figure 5(b) , R value is plotted against the ﬂare strength
which also shows a weak positive correlation of CC=∼0.33.
Whereas in Figure 5c, RSG, the ﬂux from the ﬂare eruption
site, has strong association with ﬂare strength of CC ∼0.70.
These results indicate that the ﬂux near to SGPILM has strong
connection to the ﬂare strength. This suggests that ﬂare
strength neither depends on the total unsigned ﬂux of whole
AR as it just represents the size of the AR nor depends on the
ﬂux near to all strong gradient PILs in an AR but there is a
strong physical dependence with the ﬂux from the region of
15Mm about SGPILM which overlaps the ﬂare brightening.
This result also conﬁrms Kazachenko et al. (2017) result and
may be more robust given better statistics. This reﬁned rela-
tion points the difﬁculty of predicting the ﬂare and its strength
based on the pre-ﬂare magnetograms.

Further, we explored the relationship between magnetic en-
ergy and ﬂare strength in Figure 6. The total magnetic energy
for all ﬂare events in our sample at initial and end timings of
ﬂares were estimated (Section 2.3). The total magnetic energy
and potential energy at the initial times are weakly correlated
with the ﬂare strength of correlation coefﬁcient of 0.27 each

as shown in panels 6(a & b). In panel 6(c), the magnetic free
energy is plotted against the ﬂare strength. Despite the points
are scattered, there is a moderate positive correlation with a
CC of 0.39.

In all our sample, the magnetic free energy estimated at
ﬂare end timings are found to be smaller than the magnetic
free energy estimated at the ﬂare initial timings. Panel 6(d)
depicts the correlation between the decrease in free energy
with the ﬂare strength. Unlike the energy estimates at initial
times, the scatter plot shows a moderate positive correlation
(CC = 0.55) indicating a physical link between the decrease
in amount of free magnetic energy and intensity of ﬂares. It
indicates that the total amount of magnetic energy and poten-
tial energy possessed by an AR has very little to do with the
intensity of ﬂares that the AR has produced but the difference
in total magnetic free energy before/after the ﬂare is directly
proportional to the strength of the ﬂare, as one would expect.
This result is corroborated by the strong correlation between
ﬂare strength and amount of free energy decreased during the
ﬂares (Vemareddy et al. 2012), and hence it is clearly evident
that larger the amount of energy released, stronger the erupted
ﬂares. Notedly, the free energy decrease for the CME cases
(35 of 38, red symbols) starts from 2 × 1031 ergs (Log(31.3))
and may indicates the threshold energy required for a ﬂare to
be eruptive.

3.3. Magnetic properties of Active region versus CME

kinematics

From the sample of 77, 38 ﬂares are CME associated (erup-
tive ﬂares) and have known source ARs. We used the online
LASCO/CME catalog to determine the CME/Flare associa-
tion and linear speed (LS) of the CMEs. The relationship be-

square and asterisk symbols represent the C-class, M-class and X-class ﬂares respectively. Red (blue) colors of these symbols corresponds to eruptive (conﬁned)
ﬂare cases. Note a higher correlation of decrease in free energy with ﬂare strength.

tween these 38 source AR properties and the associated CME
speeds are examined in Figure 7. The observed CME speed
follows the positive correlation with SSPILM and SGPILM
with a correlation coefﬁcients of 0.43 and 0.44 respectively.
For reference, only the plot of SGPILM versus CME linear
speed is displayed. This implies that faster CMEs tend to ini-
tiate in ARs with longer lengths of PIL surrounded by greater
magnetic complexity (Falconer et al. 2003; Song et al. 2006).
There is reasonably high positive correlation between the

decrease in magnetic free energy after the ﬂare eruption and
CME linear speed (panel 7(b)) with a CC of 0.56. We ex-
plored the relationship between magnetic free energy(FE) be-
fore the ﬂare eruption and CME linear speed as well but the
correlation is weak (plot is not shown). As the decrease in free
energy involves the difference (FEinitial − FEend), it correlates
well with CME speed. Further, we also studied the relation-
ship between total unsigned ﬂux with CME linear speed but
found out weak correlation between them (plot is not shown).

These results suggest that there is a strong physical link be-
tween the released non-potential energy of source AR and
CME speed but there is no evidence that CME kinematics de-
pends on the size of the ARs. This result is in accordance
with the past studies that were done using line-of-sight mag-
netograms (Chen et al. 2011). Chen et al. (2011) claimed that
the size, strength and complexity of ARs do little with the
kinematic properties of CMEs, but have signiﬁcant effects on
the CME productivity.

Further, ﬂare strength and CME speed are also positively
correlated with a CC of 0.49, shown in panel 7(c). This sug-
gests a general relation that CME speeds are proportional to
ﬂare strength and would underly the action of impulsive re-
connection on the expelled CME in agreement with previous
studies (Guo et al. 2007; Wang & Zhang 2007) but with few
recently found exceptions (like Sun et al. 2015).

3.4. Conﬁned and Eruptive Flares
In this section, we investigated the role of background coro-
nal ﬁeld in the conﬁned ﬂares (without CMEs) and eruptive
ﬂares (associated with CMEs). Following from procedure de-
scribed in Section 2.4, we estimated the critical decay index
heights for all 77 events in our sample. In Figure 8, n(z) is
plotted for typical cases of eruptive (left column panels) and
conﬁned ﬂares (right column panels). Bh (average of 8 points
along main PIL) as a function of height is also shown in the
respective panels. For eruptive panels, the extrapolated ﬁeld
reached this critical value at a height below 45Mm. Notedly,
at about 10Mm the curve exhibits a gradual steepness with a
"bump" in the eruptive cases and is missing in conﬁned cases
with almost a smooth curve. The "bump" is also found in
Cheng et al. (2011) study and is interpreted as a distinct shape
for eruptive and non-eruptive ﬂare events. It was noticed that
the Bh decreases faster in the low corona (about 10Mm), and
the appearance of a "bump" in the eruptive ﬂare cases which
may indicate the ability of the twisted ﬂux (ﬂux rope) to ex-
perience torus instability. From these panels, it is seen that
the n(z) curve is steeper reaching ncrit = 1.5 within 40Mm for
eruptive cases. For conﬁned ones, the n(z) is gradually reach-
ing ncrit well beyond 50Mm height.

In Figure 9, we plot the critical heights of all events versus

ﬂare strength. It can be seen that the both the conﬁned (blue
circles) and eruptive (red circles) spread all along the ncrit
height and have no relation to the ﬂare strength. Further, (Liu
2008) proposed the typical height of eruption onset is 42±1
Mm, based on the average initial heights of the 4 observed
ﬁlament events consisting of two failed eruptions and two full
eruptions. Meanwhile, many recent studies of full eruptions
indicate a critical height well below 42Mm (eg., Cheng et al.
2011; Vemareddy & Zhang 2014; Sun et al. 2015). Based
on this segregation of the events (vertical dashed line), about
90% (34 of 38) of the eruptive ﬂares have the critical height
less than 42 Mm and nearly 70% (27 of 39) of the conﬁned
ﬂares have the critical height beyond 42Mm as evident in Fig-
ure 9. Though the dependency of critical heights is a mat-
ter of individual cases, generally critical heights depend on
the strength of background ﬁeld conﬁnement but does not de-
pends on the intensity of ﬂares. This indicates that the back-
ground ﬁeld for conﬁned cases has extended or stronger con-
ﬁnement than the eruptive ones. Depending on the extent
of this conﬁned environment, the unstable core ﬁeld (or ﬂux
rope) near the main PIL would be suppressed or become a
CME and is the subject of individual cases. From this statisti-
cal study, we propose that a CME is likely from an AR coronal
background ﬁeld where n(z) reaches ncrit below 42Mm.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Using the HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld observations, we have
studied the relation of degree of magnetic non-potentiality
with the observed ﬂare/CME in ARs. Studying the relation of
these properties and establishing statistically signiﬁcant link
with the observed activity is the key in the ﬂare/CME forecast-
ing models. In this connection, we made a systematic analy-
sis of several non-potential proxies, including decrease in free
magnetic energy proxy, during ﬂares/CMEs of different mag-
nitude. The chosen ﬂare cases originated from 40 ARs, of
which 83% (19 of 23) in the southern hemisphere, 70% (12 of
17) in the northern hemisphere follow the dominant helicity
sign rule (Pevtsov et al. 1995; Bao et al. 2002).

SSPILM). Manual detection accounts the AIA 1600Å ﬂare
the SGPILM have
ribbon extension along PIL. Further,
stronger positive correlation with ﬂare strength (0.9) than that
of SSPILM with ﬂare strength (CC=0.8) and therefore the
magnetic gradient seems to be better correlated with inten-
sity of solar ﬂares than magnetic shear. It is in a quantitative
agreement with Wang et al. (2006) where they found this re-
lation in a sample of 5 X-class ﬂaring ARs.

The total unsigned ﬂux of the entire AR (Φ) and Schri-
jver’s R value were found to be weakly correlated with the
ﬂare strength but RSG, the total unsigned ﬂux within 15 Mm
of SGPILM has a statistically signiﬁcant correlation with ﬂare

strength (0.70). This strong correlation signiﬁes the physical
link between the PIL ﬂux and ﬂare intensity. The ﬂux near
SGPILM must be contributing in ﬂaring process similar to the
ﬂare ribbon reconnection ﬂux deﬁned by Kazachenko et al.
(2017). As the amount of ﬂux involved in the ﬂaring process
increases, the intensity of ﬂares also increases but this effect
is camouﬂaged in Φ and R value in order to reﬂect in the in-
tensity of the ﬂares. Both the SGPILM and RSG are related to
the actual ﬂux involved in the reconnection along PIL. There-
fore, it is difﬁcult to predict the ﬂare strength a priori based
on pre-ﬂare magnetogram and points the missing key aspect
in the ﬂare prediction models (Mason & Hoeksema 2010).

In addition, background ﬁeld appears to be key factor for a
ﬂare to be eruptive. In 90% of eruptive ﬂares, the n(z) curve is
steeper reaching ncrit within 42Mm, whereas >70% conﬁned
ﬂares occur in ARs of ncrit beyond 42Mm. Recent study by
Vemareddy (2017) inferred the successive sigmoid formation
and eruption in AR 12371 under the slow evolving conditions
of predominant negative helicity ﬂux injection from the SG-
PIL region. Minimum length of the SGPIL may be the signa-
ture of the twisted ﬂux rope. In the conﬁned AR 12192 (no
CMEs but with X-ﬂares), the magnetic ﬂux normalized he-
licity ﬂux is smaller by a factor of 10 and has no signatures
of twisted ﬂux rope in coronal imaging observations. As the
ﬂux rope is a continuous bundle of twisted ﬁeld structure, its
existence also assumes continuous SGPIL, but not as small
distributed segments. Therefore, besides with the minimum
required SGPIL length (31Mm, Figure 4), the weak back-
ground ﬁeld (< 42Mm) are suggested to be the prime factors
for a ﬂare to be eruptive.

The above inference is tested for the statistical signiﬁcance.
The skill scores estimated in section 3.1 suggests that SGPILM
does not have the ability to aptly predict the CMEs from
ﬂaring ARs. However, owing to the moderate level of skill
scores and correlation with CME productivity (Figure 7(a)),
the SGPILM combined with the measures of the coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration would give better CME predicting
capabilities. These conclusions should be tested with many
more events before the relationship could be said to be ro-
bust enough to have better CME prediction capabilities. Ob-
viously, the next step would be considering many more events
and run a machine learning algorithm. The machine Learning
algorithm can learn from input data and improve from expe-
rience, without human intervention. For our type of study, we
can use non-linear classiﬁcation machine learning algorithm,
like support vector machine algorithm used in Bobra & Cou-
vidat (2015), to have more quantitative rigour and check for
robustness of these results.

FIG. 9.— Scatter plot of critical heights for all the ﬂare events in the sample
with the ﬂare strength. Red (blue) circles represent the eruptive (conﬁned)
ﬂares. Vertical dashed line refers to critical height of 42Mm and divides the
eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares.

Total magnetic energy and potential energy of ﬂaring ARs
derived from virial theorem were found to be weakly corre-
lated with ﬂare strength whereas the magnetic free energy
derived at the initial time of ﬂare events has positive corre-
lation with ﬂare strength. Importantly, magnetic free energy
decreases after the ﬂare eruption and the amount of decrease
in free energy has the strong positive correlation with ﬂare
strength. These results suggest that there is a strong physical
link between released magnetic free energy and ﬂare produc-
tivity, and also the intensity of ﬂares produced. The amount
of total magnetic energy and potential energy possessed in an
AR are not much related to the intensity of ﬂares that the AR
has produced but how much free energy released, has a major
contribution to the intensity of ﬂares.

Moreover, we analysed the dependence of CME kinematics
from our ﬂaring sample that are associated with CMEs. Both
SSPILM and SGPILM are moderately correlated with CME
speed. Also, the amount of magnetic free energy decreased
during ﬂare eruptions has relatively strong correlation with
CME speed at correlation coefﬁcient of 0.56. These ﬁndings
imply a general relation that stronger the measures of non-
potentiality of source ARs, larger the CME speed (Wang &
Zhang 2007). And we also found the most common relation
between ﬂare strength and CME speed (CC=0.49), indicat-
ing that faster CMEs tend to be associated with more intense
ﬂares.
