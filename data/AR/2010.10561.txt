GROWTH ESTIMATES FOR GENERALIZED HARMONIC
FORMS ON NONCOMPACT MANIFOLDS WITH GEOMETRIC
APPLICATIONS

SHIHSHU WALTER WEI∗

Abstract. We introduce Condition W (1.2) for a smooth diﬀerential form ω
on a complete noncompact Riemannian manifold M . We prove that ω is a
harmonic form on M if and only if ω is both closed and co-closed on M , where
ω has 2-balanced growth either for q = 2 , or for 1 < q(6= 2) < 3 with ω
satisfying Condition W (1.2) . In particular, every L2 harmonic form, or every
Lq harmonic form, 1 < q(6= 2) < 3 satisfying Condition W (1.2) is both closed
and co-closed (cf. Theorem 1.1). This generalizes the work of A. Andreotti
and E. Vesentini [AV] for every L2 harmonic form ω . In extending ω in L2 to
Lq, for q 6= 2, Condition W (1.2) has to be imposed due to counter-examples
of D. Alexandru-Rugina(cid:0)[AR] p. 81, Remarque 3(cid:1). We then study nonlinear
partial diﬀerential inequalities for diﬀerential forms hω, ∆ωi ≥ 0, in which so-
lutions ω can be viewed as generalized harmonic forms. We prove that under
the same growth assumption on ω (as in Theorem 1.1, or 1.2, or 1.3), the fol-
hω, ∆ωi ≥ 0 , (ii) ∆ω = 0 , (iii) d ω = d⋆ω = 0 ,
lowing six statements: (i)
h⋆ ω, ∆ ⋆ ωi ≥ 0 , (v) ∆ ⋆ ω = 0 , and (vi) d ⋆ ω = d⋆ ⋆ ω = 0
(iv)
are equivalent (cf. Theorem 4.1). We also show the nonexistence of eigenform
associated with positive eigenvalue for ∆ω = λω , and the nonexistence of solu-
tion of hω, ∆ωi > 0 , under the same growth assumption on ω . As a geometric
application, we observe that a both closed and co-closed form on M satisﬁes
a conservation law (8.5) and can apply the theory we developed in [DW] and
[W3]. Based on comparison theorem in Riemannian geometry under a curva-
ture assumption, a conservation law, variational method and coarea formula,
we solve constant Dirichlet problems for generalized harmonic 1-forms and F -
harmonic maps (cid:0)When F (t) = t, they becomre harmonic maps(cid:1) on starlike
domains in M (cf. Theorem 10.3 and Theorem 10.2, generalizing and extend-
ing the work of Karcher and Wood for harmonic maps on disc domains in Rn
[KW]), derive monotonicity formulas for 2-balanced solutions, and vanishing
theorems for 2-moderate solutions of hω, ∆ωi ≥ 0 on M (cf. Theorem 8.2 and
Theorem 9.3).

1. Introduction

The study of harmonic forms, or more generally p-harmonic geometry is an active
research area that interacts with or enters into many branches of mathematics.
Harmonic forms generalize harmonic functions in the study of partial diﬀerential
equations and potential theory, and are privileged representatives in a de Rham
cohomology class picked out by the Hodge Laplacian. It is well-known that on a

On complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds, although (1.1) holds for smooth
ω with compact support, it does not hold in general. Simple examples include, in
Rn , a closed, non-co-closed, harmonic form ω1 = x1dx1 , a non-closed, co-closed,
harmonic form ω2 = xndx1 , and a non-closed, non-co-closed, harmonic form ω3 =
(x1 + xn)dx1 , or ω4 = x1xndx1 + xndxn . However, it is proved in [AV]

−

Theorem A (A. Andreotti and E. Vesentini [AV]). On a complete noncompact
Riemannian manifold M , (1.1) holds for every smooth L2 diﬀerential form ω .

It is interesting to explore any possible generalizations of Theorem A, in par-
ticular, to discuss whether or not (1.1) holds for Lq diﬀerential form ω , where
= 2 . Some study of this generalization can be found in [Y1, p.663, Proposition

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we introduce and add Condition W (1.2) to
the above study in extending ω in L2 to ω in Lq, q

in a more general setting with geometric and analytic applications. From now on,

p-mild, p-obtuse, p-moderate, or p-small growth on M , and has p-imbalanced growth
( or, simply, is p-imbalanced ) otherwise (cf. Deﬁnition 2.3).

Furthermore, extending our techniques for function growth (cf. [CW1, CW2]) to
diﬀerential form growth, we use direct simple new methods (cf. Proofs of Theorems
3.4 and 3.5) and obtain

or
with ω satisf ying Condition W (1.2),

then (1.1) holds.

When ω is in L2 , we recapture Theorem A of Andreotti and Vesentini, as an
L2 form has 2-ﬁnite, 2-mild, 2-obtuse, 2-moderate, and 2-small growth for q = 2,
by Proposition 2.2, and hence has 2-balanced growth for q = 2 , by Deﬁnition 2.3.
Theorem 1.1 also extends ω in L2 to ω in Lq , 1 < q(
= 2) < 3 , and to 2-balanced
growth for 1 < q(
= 2) < 3 . But this extension, in sharp contrast to the 2-balanced
growth for q = 2 extension, requires an additional assumption that ω satisﬁes
Condition W (1.2). Or there would be counter-examples
[AR] p. 81, Remarque
. For clarity, it will be discussed in Remarks 3.2 and 3.3,
3 in reference to [Y1]
that why, where, and how Condition W (1.2) is used for the case q
= 2, and is not
needed for the case q = 2 in the uniﬁed proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. Furthermore,
examples and counter-examples of diﬀerential forms that satisfy Condition W (1.2)
are also provided (cf. Propositions 2.3 and 2.4, and Remark 2.1). As an immediate

(iii) Let ω be an Lq, 1 < q < 3 diﬀerential 0-form on M . Then ω is a harmonic

In view of Propositions 2.3 and 2.4, we have

Corollary 1.2. Let ω be a simple k-form or a diﬀerential k-form satisfying Kato’s
type inequality (2.7) on M . If ω has 2-balanced growth for 1 < q < 3 , then ω is

every Lq , 1 < q < 3 simple k-form or a diﬀerential k-form ω satisfying (2.7) on
M , (1.1) holds.

The above Kato’s type inequality (2.7) in Corollary 1.2 has to be assumed, as
the Kato’s type inequality (2.7) holds for smooth functions, but does not hold for
diﬀerential forms in general, cf. Remark 2.2 for a counter-example of Kato’s type
inequality.
