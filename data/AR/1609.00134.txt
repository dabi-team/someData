ABSTRACT

Aims. The magnetic ﬁeld of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) determines their structure, evolution, and energetics, as well
as their geoeﬀectiveness. However, we currently lack routine diagnostics of the near-Sun CME magnetic ﬁeld, which is
crucial for determining the subsequent evolution of CMEs.
Methods. We recently presented a method to infer the near-Sun magnetic ﬁeld magnitude of CMEs and then extrapolate
it to 1 AU. This method uses relatively easy to deduce observational estimates of the magnetic helicity in CME-source
regions along with geometrical CME ﬁts enabled by coronagraph observations. We hereby perform a parametric study
of this method aiming to assess its robustness. We use statistics of active region (AR) helicities and CME geometrical
parameters to determine a matrix of plausible near-Sun CME magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes. In addition, we extrapolate
this matrix to 1 AU and determine the anticipated range of CME magnetic ﬁelds at 1 AU representing the radial falloﬀ
of the magnetic ﬁeld in the CME out to interplanetary (IP) space by a power law with index αB.
Results. The resulting distribution of the near-Sun (at 10 R⊙ ) CME magnetic ﬁelds varies in the range [0.004, 0.02]
G, comparable to, or higher than, a few existing observational inferences of the magnetic ﬁeld in the quiescent corona
at the same distance. We also ﬁnd that a theoretically and observationally motivated range exists around αB = -1.6
±0.2, thereby leading to a ballpark agreement between our estimates and observationally inferred ﬁeld magnitudes of
magnetic clouds (MCs) at L1.
Conclusions. In a statistical sense, our method provides results that are consistent with observations.

1. Introduction

Knowledge of the magnetic ﬁeld entrained in coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) is a crucial parameter for their energet-
ics, dynamics, structuring, and eventually of their geoeﬀec-
tiveness. For instance, the overall CME energy budget is
dominated by the energy stored in non-potential magnetic
ﬁelds (e.g., Forbes 2000; Vourlidas et al. 2000). In addition,
given that CMEs and interplanetary (IP) counterparts (in-
terplanetary CMEs (ICMEs)) are magnetic conﬁgurations
with a low-β plasma parameter, their structural evolution
as they propagate and expand into the IP space is dictated
by the balance and interactions between their magnetic
ﬁeld and the ambient solar wind (e.g., Démoulin & Dasso
2009). Moreover, upon arrival at 1 AU, the magnitude of
the southward magnetic ﬁeld of earth-directed interplane-
tary CMEs (ICMEs) is the most important parameter de-
termining their geoeﬀectiveness (e.g., Wu & Lepping 2005).
Therefore, the near-Sun magnetic ﬁeld magnitude is a key
parameter for both space weather studies and applications,
for example, by constraining the properties of coronal ﬂux
ropes ejected into the IP medium (e.g., Shiota & Kataoka
2016), and in anticipation of the observations of upcoming
solar and heliospheric missions. Unfortunately, very few di-

rect observational inferences of near-Sun (∼ 1-7 R⊙ ) CME
magnetic ﬁelds exist currently (e.g., Bastian et al. 2001;
Jensen & Russell 2008; Tun & Vourlidas 2013). These are
based on relatively rare radio emission conﬁgurations, such
as gyrosynchrotron emission from CME cores and Faraday
rotation, and require detailed physical modeling of relevant
radio emission processes to infer the magnetic ﬁeld that is
sought after.

We recently proposed a new method to deduce the near-
Sun magnetic ﬁeld magnitude (hereafter, magnetic ﬁeld)
of CMEs (Patsourakos et al. 2016). This method relies on
the conservation of magnetic helicity in cylindrical ﬂux
ropes and uses as inputs the magnetic helicity budget of
the source region and geometrical parameters (length and
radius) of the associated CME. It supplies an estimation
of the near-Sun CME magnetic ﬁeld which is then ex-
trapolated to 1 AU using a power-law fall-oﬀ dictated by
the radial (heliocentric) distance. We have successfully ap-
plied this method to a major geoeﬀective CME launched
from the Sun on 7 March 2012, which triggered one of the
most intense geomagnetic storms of solar cycle 24. Recently,
two other methods to infer the CME-ICME magnetic ﬁeld
vectors were proposed (Kunkel & Chen 2010; Savani et al.
2015). Kunkel & Chen (2010) use a ﬂux-rope CME model,
driven by poloidal magnetic ﬂux injection, which is con-
strained by the height-time proﬁle of the associated CME.

The Savani et al. (2015) method is based on the helio-
spheric magnetic helicity rule, the tilt of the source active
region (AR), and the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the com-
pression region around the CME.

In this work we perform a parametric study of the
method to assess its robustness before applying it to ob-
served cases. We essentially use distributions of input pa-
rameters derived from observations to determine the near-
Sun and 1 AU magnetic ﬁelds for a set of synthetic CMEs.
This study oﬀers statistics suﬃcient to determine the range
of the anticipated CME magnetic ﬁelds both near-Sun and
at 1 AU. The latter distribution is compared to actual
magnetic-cloud (MC) observations at 1 AU.

In the following, Section 2 describes how we infer the
near-Sun CME magnetic ﬁeld, while Section 3 describes
how this value is extrapolated to 1 AU. Section 4 describes
our parametric study, Section 5 includes some further tests
and uncertainty estimations, while Section 6 summarizes
our results, their limitations, and an outlook for future re-
visions.

2. The helicity-based method to infer the near-Sun

magnetic ﬁeld of CMEs

2.1. Theory

We use the Lundquist ﬂux-rope model (Lundquist 1950) as
a typical IP prescription of propagating MCs. This is an ax-
isymmetric force-free solution with components expressed
in cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) as
(1)
Br = 0, Bφ = σH B0J1(αr), Bz = B0J0(αr),
where J0 and J1 are the Bessel functions of the zeroth and
ﬁrst kind, respectively, σH = ±1 is the helicity sign (i.e,
handedness), α is the (constant) force-free parameter, and
B0 is the maximum (axial) magnetic ﬁeld. The standard
assumption that the ﬁrst zero of J0 occurs at the edge of the
ﬂux rope (e.g., Lepping et al. 1990) is made here, namely
(2)
αR = 2.405,
with R corresponding to the ﬂux-rope radius. This assump-
tion leads to a purely axial or azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld at
the ﬂux-rope axis or edge.

Following Equation 9 of Dasso et al. (2006), the mag-
netic helicity Hm of a Lundquist ﬂux rope is written as

Hm =

where L is the ﬂux-rope length. The CME magnetic ﬁeld
distribution at 15 R⊙ from an 2.5D MHD simulation was
found to be in excellent agreement with the Lundquist
model described above (see Figure 8 in Lynch et al. 2004).
Solution of the above equation for the unknown axial

magnetic ﬁeld B0, with the aid of Equation 2, gives

Hence, the parameters determining B0, via the applica-
tion of Equations 2, 4, and 5, in this case are the length L
and radius R of the ﬂux-rope CME along with its magnetic
helicity content, Hm.

2.2. Observational constraints to determine the near-Sun

CME magnetic ﬁeld magnitude

From the analysis of the previous section, one needs to know
a set of magnetic and geometrical properties of a CME to
calculate the axial magnetic ﬁeld B0. In this section we
discuss how to deduce estimates of these parameters from
observations.

To infer the magnetic helicity content Hm of a CME,
one needs to ﬁrst calculate the coronal helicity content of
the solar source region. This is achieved in various ways.
These methods typically use photospheric, mainly vector,
magnetograms and are based on various theoretical setups,
including the calculation of the magnetic helicity-injection
rate from photospheric motions (Pariat et al. 2006), par-
titioning of the photospheric ﬂux into assumed slender
ﬂux tubes, calculation of the connectivity matrix to de-
duce the total helicity (Georgoulis et al. 2012), and clas-
sical volume calculations on coronal magnetic ﬁeld ex-
trapolations (Régnier & Canﬁeld 2006; Valori et al. 2012;
Moraitis et al. 2014, among others). Detailed descriptions
of the diﬀerent methods can be found in the above works.
To obtain the geometrical parameters R and L we use
the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) forward ﬁtting model
of Thernisien et al. (2009). This is a geometrical ﬂux-rope
model routinely used to ﬁt the large-scale appearance of
ﬂux-rope CMEs in multi-viewpoint observations acquired
by the coronagraphs on board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Ob-
servatory (STEREO) spacecraft. The GCS user modiﬁes a
set of free geometrical (front height H, half-angular width
w, aspect ratio k, and tilt angle) and positional (central lon-
gitude and latitude) parameters of the ﬂux-rope CME until
a satisfactory agreement is achieved between the model pro-
jections and the actual observations. A detailed description
can be found in Thernisien et al. (2009).

In the framework of the GCS model, the CME radius R

at a heliocentric distance r is

R(r) = kr.

(6)

To assess the ﬂux-rope length L,
it is assumed that
the CME front is a cylindrical section (see Figure 1 of
Démoulin & Dasso (2009)) with an angular width provided
by the geometrical ﬁtting. One may then write

L = 2wrmid,

(7)

where rmid(= H − R) is the heliocentric distance halfway
through the model’s cross section, along its axis of symme-
try. The half-angular width w is given in radians.

It is important to realize that the source-region deter-
minations of magnetic helicity, including estimates of the
CME helicity content Hm, correspond to the photosphere
or low corona, while those for R and L refer to the outer
corona, which are typically a few solar radii in heliocen-
tric distance. To allow the use of this Hm we adhere to the
well-documented conservation principle of magnetic helic-
ity (Berger 1984; Berger 1999). Indeed, for a magnetized
plasma with a high magnetic Reynolds number, as the solar
corona is widely believed to be, the relative magnetic helic-
ity is conserved even in case of magnetic reconnection; for
a recent, successful test of the conservation principle, see
Pariat et al. (2015). Assuming that an ascending CME in
the solar corona does not accumulate substantial overlying
magnetic structures that drastically modify its magnetic

Patsourakos & Georgoulis: Parametric study to infer near-Sun CME and 1 AU ICME magnetic ﬁelds

helicity content, we use its estimated low-coronal Hm up to
the outer corona.

Summarizing, estimates of R, L, and Hm allow us to
estimate an upper limit of the near-Sun axial magnetic
ﬁeld B0 of ﬂux-rope CMEs at distances covered by coro-
nagraphs.

3. Extrapolation of the near-Sun CME magnetic

ﬁeld magnitude to 1 AU

To extrapolate the near-Sun CME magnetic-ﬁeld magni-
tude B∗, determined at a heliocentric distance r∗ (Section
2), to 1 AU, we assume that its radial evolution follows a
power-law behavior of the form
B0(r) = B∗(r/r∗)αB ,

(8)

4. For the B∗ calculated in step 3, and for each of the 18
equidistant values with a step equal to 0.1 covering the
αB range ([-2.7,-1.0]) described in the previous section,
we determine 18 CME magnetic ﬁeld (B1AU ) values at
r = 1AU from Equation 8.

5. We repeated 104 times the process of randomly selecting
Hm, R, and L to get a corresponding B∗ (steps 1-3).
This supplied suﬃcient statistics to build a database
of synthetic CMEs. The combination of the 104 near-
Sun CME magnetic ﬁeld values with the 18 diﬀerent
αB values gave rise to 180,000 total values of the CME
magnetic ﬁeld at 1 AU.

In essence, the above parameterization provides 104 near-
Sun CME magnetic ﬁelds B∗ and, out of those, 1.8 × 105
ICME magnetic ﬁelds B1AU at 1 AU.

with r corresponding to the heliocentric distance. In Equa-
tion 8 we assume that the power-law index αB varies in
the range [-2.7, -1.0]. This is a typical approximation that
is frequently followed in the literature (e.g., Patzold et al.
1987; Kumar & Rust 1996; Bothmer & Schwenn 1998;
Forsyth et al.
Liu et al.

2006; Leitner et al.
2007; Démoulin & Dasso
2013;
Poomvises et al.
Winslow et al.
2016). These
2015; Good & Forsyth
theoretical and observational studies also roughly deter-
mine the range of αB values used here. Most of these
studies do not fully cover the range (i.e., [10 R⊙ , 1 AU])
we are considering here, but typically subsets thereof,
either near-Sun or inner heliospheric.

4. Parametric study

The parameterization of our method consists of the follow-
ing steps:

1. We randomly select a magnetic helicity value Hm result-
ing from a distribution of 162 active-region helicity val-
ues at diﬀerent times, corresponding to 42 diﬀerent solar
ARs (Tziotziou et al. 2012). The selected active-region
helicity is then assigned to a synthetic CME, therefore
assuming for simplicity, that the CME is fully extract-
ing its source region helicity. Given the ample dynamical
range of the helicity values in the above study (at least
three orders of magnitude), even assigning a fraction of
each active-region helicity value to model the CME he-
licity would not lead to remarkably diﬀerent statistical
results.

2. We randomly select CME aspect ratios and angular
widths from distributions resulting from the forward
modeling of 65 CMEs observed by the STEREO coro-
nagraphs (Thernisien et al. 2009; Bosman et al. 2012).
The observations correspond to a distance of 10 R⊙ ,
therefore supplying near-Sun geometric properties of the
observed CMEs. The GCS model of Thernisien et al.
(2009), described in Section 2, was used in the analysis
of these observations. The deduced CME aspect ratios
and angular widths take values in the intervals [0.09,0.7]
and [6,41] degrees, respectively. We then deduce the cor-
responding radii R and lengths L from Equations 6 and
7, respectively.

Fig. 1. Probability density functions of the derived near-Sun
CME magnetic ﬁelds for 104 synthetic CMEs in two diﬀerent
cases: using the sample of all (eruptive and non-eruptive) active-
region relative magnetic helicity budgets Hm (black histogram)
and using only the subsample of eruptive active-region helicity
budgets (blue histogram). The horizontal orange bar shows the
range of various observational estimates for the magnetic ﬁeld
of the quiescent (i.e., noneruptive) solar corona. In all cases, the
estimates correspond to a heliocentric distance of 10 R⊙ .

In Figure 1 we show the probability density function
(PDF) of the derived near-Sun CME magnetic ﬁelds B∗ at
r∗ = 10 R⊙ in two diﬀerent situations: using all active-
region helicity values of Tziotziou et al. (2012) (black his-
togram) and using only the active-region helicity values of
eruptive regions (i.e., hosting ﬂares of GOES class M1.0 and
above), in which case these values exceed 2 × 1042Mx
(blue
histogram). In the ﬁrst case, the PDF peaks at ≈ 0.007
G and has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) range
at roughly [0.004, 0.03] G. The distribution is asymmetric,
showing an extended B∗ tail. In the second case, the PDF
peaks at higher values, ∼ 0.03 G, and presents a FWHM
at roughly [0.02, 0.06] G. This distribution corresponds to
ARs that are known to be more prone to eruptions (e.g.,
Andrews 2003; Nindos et al. 2015).

Poomvises et al.
2013;
Susino et al. 2015). They mainly correspond to obser-
vations in the quiescent corona and are represented by the
orange horizontal bar in Figure 1. A signiﬁcant fraction
of the synthetic CMEs have magnetic ﬁelds comparable
to or higher than those corresponding to the quiescent
corona. The latter is essentially the case for the subset
of synthetic CMEs that correspond to prone-to-erupt
ARs. Our results are thus consistent with the notion that
CMEs are structures with stronger magnetic ﬁelds than
the quiescent ambient corona.

A context representation of the extrapolated CME-
ICME magnetic ﬁelds at 1 AU, B1AU , for the 180,000 con-
sidered cases, is given in Figure 2. Here we use a color
representation of B1AU as a function of B∗ and αB. The
color scaling has been saturated so that B∗ values outside
the range of magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes in observed mag-
netic clouds (MCs) at 1 AU, namely BMC ∈ [4, 45] nT,
are shown in either black (smaller) or white (higher). Any
other color corresponds to projected B∗ values within the
observed BMC range. The distribution of BMC results from
linear force-free ﬁts of 162 MCs observed in situ at 1 AU by
WIND (Lynch et al. 2003; Lepping et al. 2006). Several re-
marks can be made from this image. First, there is a signiﬁ-
cant number of cases, i.e., (B∗- αB) pairs, resulting in B1AU
values outside the observed BMC range. This suggests that
the corresponding parameter space can be signiﬁcantly con-
strained. Second, B1AU seems to depend more sensitively
on αB than on B∗. This can be assessed from Figure 2 by
noting that while the vertical colored (i.e., not black and
white) bands corresponding to a given B∗ in agreement
with the observed BMC range show more or less the same
extent, this is not the case for the horizontal colored bands
corresponding to a given αB. In this latter case, we also
notice very narrow bands at both ends of the employed αB
range.

Patsourakos & Georgoulis: Parametric study to infer near-Sun CME and 1 AU ICME magnetic ﬁelds

To better understand the B1AU sensitivity on αB we
perform the following further tests. In Figure 3 we show the
histogram of B1AU (orange curve) corresponding to the full
range of the considered αB values, which is overplotted on
the histogram of BMC (blue curve). It is then clear that the
two histograms do not match, even saliently. This suggests
that not all employed αB values yield consistent results,
which is in line with the result of Figure 2.

Fig. 5. Correlation coeﬃcient of the probability density func-
tions for the predicted B1AU and observed BM C values at L1
as a function of αB (red curve). Also shown is the respective
fraction of B1AU values (blue curve) falling within the observed
BM C range.

In Figure 4 we show the B1AU histograms correspond-
ing to three diﬀerent, speciﬁc values of αB. These values
were meant to represent the two extremes of the αB dis-
tribution, but also a value maximizing the reproduction of
BMC by B1AU . Radial falloﬀs of the CME-ICME magnetic
ﬁeld that are too steep (αB=-2.6; top plot) or too shallow
(αB=-1.2; bottom plot) give rise to B1AU values that are
too low and too high, respectively, compared with the MC
observations. On the other hand, setting αB=-1.6 (middle
plot) we obtain a fair agreement between the predicted and
observed CME magnetic ﬁelds at 1 AU, at least for the bulk
of the distribution. Both distributions peak around 10 nT
and have similar FWHM of ∼ 15 nT. However, the modeled
distribution has a high-B tail that is not present in the MC
observations. A similar value for αB was found in an appli-
cation of the method to a single event (Patsourakos et al.
2016).

Clearly, there is a range of αB values around -1.6 that
yields results that are consistent with MC observations. We
produced Figure 5 to ﬁrmly establish this interval and quan-
tify its merit. In this test we show the linear correlation
coeﬃcient (red curve) between BMC and B1U histograms
as a function of αB, thus obtaining 18 values of this cor-
relation coeﬃcient. We ﬁnd that the correlation coeﬃcient
exhibits a well-deﬁned peak around 0.9 at αB=-1.6 and
stays above 0.5 when αB ∈ [-1.9,-1.5]. Very small or even
negative correlation coeﬃcients are found when αB moves
toward extreme values of its assumed range.

Another useful measure of best-ﬁt αB values is provided
by the fraction of the projected or predicted values B1AU

agreeing with the range of BMC values as a function of αB.
This is shown by the blue curve in Figure 5. The peak of
this fraction occurs at 0.8 (80 %) for a slightly diﬀerent
αB value (-1.9) compared to the peak of the correlation
coeﬃcient (-1.6). Nonetheless, the fraction is above 0.5 (50
%) for αB ∈ [-1.9,-1.5]. The relative discrepancy between
the peaks of the two curves in Figure 5 is not unexpected.
Indeed, the correlation coeﬃcient measures the degree of
overlap between the two distributions, while the fraction
denotes the subset of points within a given range with no a
priori reason for the two distributions to match. Since both
the fraction and correlation coeﬃcient reach their maxima
for αB ∈ [-1.9,-1.5], however, we consider this range as the
best-ﬁt range, as we are able to reproduce the observed
BMC distribution relatively well and at the same time yield
a signiﬁcant number of cases within the BMC range.

5. Further tests and an uncertainty estimation for

αB

An important issue, which is directly relevant to our anal-
ysis, is how the (input) AR helicity PDF relates to the MC
helicity content at 1 AU. To investigate this, we constructed
the PDF of the magnetic helicity of MCs observed at 1 AU
(see also Lynch et al. (2005) and Démoulin et al. (2016)
for MC Hm PDFs) and compared it with the AR helicities
used in this study. We used the Lundquist linear force-free
model, as in our analysis, to obtain MC helicities and ap-
plied this model to the MC ﬁttings of Lynch et al. (2003)
and Lepping et al. (2006). We used two diﬀerent approaches
for the MC lengths required in the Hm calculation. First,
we used the results in situ observations of near-relativistic
electrons inside MCs, which can supply a proxy for their
lengths, given their solar release times, onset times at 1 AU,
and speeds (e.g., Larson et al. 1997). This is because near-
relativistic electrons, assuming they propagate scatter-free,
have small gyroradii and thus follow the magnetic ﬁeld very
closely. A statistical study of 30 near-relativistic events in
8 MCs gave an average MC length of 2.28 AU (Kahler et
al. 2011). Second, we adopted the statistical approach of
Démoulin et al. (2016). This study used the results of MC
ﬁttings of Lynch et al. (2003) and Lepping et al. (2006) and
found that several MC properties, including their helicity
per unit length, do not depend signiﬁcantly on the position
along the MC axis. This allowed the derivation of a generic
shape for the MC axis, parameterized in terms of its an-
gular span, which further enabled an estimation of the MC
length assuming a rooting of both its legs in the Sun. The
resulting average MC length was 2.6 AU. The average of
the two MC-length estimates above, which we use for the
remainder of this Section, is 2.44 AU.

We further constructed a helicity PDF for the synthetic
MCs of this study. For this task we used the B1AU val-
ues of these MCs, an average MC length of 2.44 AU, and
an average MC radius of 0.11 AU, as obtained by Lynch
et al. (2003) and Lepping et al. (2006). Figure 6 depicts
the resulting MC Hm distribution from (i) the above lit-
erature studies (blue histogram), (ii) the source ARs (red
histogram), and (iii) our synthetic MCs (green histogram).
2
The maximum-likelihood values and FWHMs (in 1042Mx
)
of the three distributions are 6.3 and 5.3 for the AR Hm
distribution; 6.3 and 13.3 for the literature work estimates;
and 15.8 and 248.7 for the synthetic MC Hm of this study.

the signiﬁcant overlap, however, we could say that the dis-
tributions are not dissimilar. Again, this is not totally un-
expected because of systematic eﬀects involved in calcula-
tions. In addition, these diﬀerences may be due to the fact
that our method does not explicitly invoke the near-Sun-1
AU helicity conservation, however, a power-law formulation
that has been introduced in line with many previous stud-
ies, but in a rather ad hoc manner.

Concluding, it seems reasonable to expect some diﬀer-
ences in the statistical distributions of the AR and MC
helicities. That said, several studies found an overall agree-
ment, albeit with signiﬁcant uncertainties, between the
source region eruption-related and associated MC helicities
(e.g., Green et al. 2002; Nindos et al. 2003; Luoni et al. 2005;
Mandrini et al. 2005; Rodriguez et al. 2008; Kazachenko et
al. 2012). This rough Hm conservation was found not only
between the Sun and 1 AU, but also for a MC observed at
1 AU and at 5.4 AU (Nakwacki et al. 2011). Finally, sta-
tistical studies found that the Hm signs of the CME source
regions matches those of associated MCs for up to 88 %
(Bothmer & Schwenn 1998; Cho et al. 2013). These stud-
ies underline the connection between the source region and
MC Hm, at the same time shedding light on the signiﬁcant
uncertainties present in all stages of the calculations. This
remains an objective for future eﬀorts to narrow down and
constrain the various uncertainties and modulations.

Further on, we brieﬂy investigate the sensitivity of the
near-Sun B0 value to the input AR helicity. This was
achieved by overestimating and underestimating the AR
Hm values by factors of 3 and 1/3, for reasons explained
above. Factors 3 (1/3) give rise to higher (lower) near-
Sun magnetic ﬁelds, and therefore steeper (shallower) radial
falloﬀs of the CME magnetic ﬁeld in the IP space are re-
quired in order to match the observed magnetic-ﬁeld range
in MCs. The values of the power-law index αB yielding a
maximum correlation between the predicted and observed
MC magnetic ﬁeld are -1.8 and -1.4, respectively. These
αB values correspond to rather small departures from the
best-ﬁt αB of -1.6 and could thus serve as a measure of the
uncertainty (±0.2) of the best-ﬁt αB.

6. Summary and discussion

Developing methods for the practical estimation of the mag-
netic ﬁeld of CMEs, both near the Sun and at 1 AU, is a
timely and important task for assessing the near-Sun ener-
getics and dynamics of CMEs and for providing clues of the
possible geoeﬀectiveness of their ICME counterparts. We
recently developed one such method and we hereby per-
form a parametric study of it. Our study only applies to
the CME magnetic-ﬁeld magnitude and not its orientation,
hence, reaching results pertinent to the CME geoeﬀective-
ness requires an extension of this work. Our major conclu-
sions are the following:

1. The predicted near-Sun CME (at 10 R⊙ ) magnetic
ﬁelds (Figure 1) exhibit a FWHM range of [0.004, 0.03]
G and their distribution shows values that are com-
parable to, or higher than, magnetic ﬁelds measured
in the quiescent corona by a handful of observations.
For solar AR sources prone to eruptions, the FWHM of
CME magnetic ﬁelds is [0.02, 0.07] G, which is clearly
higher than the quiescent-corona magnetic ﬁeld at 10
R⊙ (Figure 1).

Clearly, our AR Hm distribution shows a deﬁcit com-
pared to both observed and synthetic MC Hm distribu-
tions. With respect to the observed MC distribution, this
is not totally unexpected, as both AR and MC Hm cal-
culations are model dependent, and possibly involve vari-
ous systematic eﬀects. For example, Tziotziou et al. (2013)
calculated AR helicities using the Georgoulis et al. (2012)
method that, by construction, infers a lower limit of AR
free energies and the corresponding relative magnetic helic-
ity. Diﬀerent helicity calculation methods in ARs give rise
to diﬀerence factors ranging between 1 and several (but
less than 10) units. An analysis by Tziotziou et al. (2016,
in preparation), in particular, gave a diﬀerence factor of
∼ 2.5, while Tziotziou et al. (2013) and Nindos & Andrews
(2004) independently found average AR helicities on the
and 19.5 ×1042 Mx
order 6.6 ×1042 Mx
, which also diﬀer
by a factor of ∼3. In addition, one cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that CMEs accumulate more helicity during their
initial stages in the inner corona by poloidal magnetic ﬂux
addition via magnetic reconnection with their surroundings
(e.g., Lin et al. 2004; Qiu et al. 2007) and, conversely, loose
helicity in the inner heliosphere owing to magnetic erosion
(e.g., Dasso et al. 2006; Gosling et al. 2007; Manchester et
al. 2014; Ruﬀenach et al. 2015). Moreover, the ﬂux-rope
structure (i.e., twisted magnetic ﬁelds) may be conﬁned
only to the MC leading edge, (e.g., Owens 2016), suggesting
that the employed magnetic ﬁeld lengths in MC Hm calcu-
lations could represent upper limits. Finally, while diﬀerent
cylindrical MC models applied to the same data set lead
to rather small diﬀerences in the resulting helicities (up to
∼ 30 % ; Gulisano et al. (2005)), departures from circu-
lar MC cross sections could lead to larger (by a factor 2-3)
diﬀerences (Démoulin et al. 2016).

Comparing the synthetic and observed MC Hm distri-
butions from Figure 6, we see than the former corresponds
to somewhat higher values compared to the latter. Given

2. The extrapolated CME-ICME magnetic ﬁeld at 1 AU
depends more sensitively on the power-law index αB of
its radial dependence than on the near-Sun CME mag-
netic ﬁelds (Figure 2).

3. Considering the full range of literature-suggested αB
values ([-2.7,-1.0]), we ﬁnd that the extrapolated near-
Sun magnetic ﬁelds at 1 AU do not match MC magnetic-
ﬁeld measurements (Figure 3).

4. For αB varying in the range [-1.9,-1.4], we obtain a con-
siderable ballpark agreement with MC magnetic-ﬁeld
measurements at 1 AU in terms of both the similarity
of the corresponding distributions and the high fraction
of B1AU values falling within the BMC value range. A
best-ﬁt αB attains a value of -1.6 (Figures 4, 5).

Statistically, therefore, our method is able to repro-
duce the ballpark of the ICME magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes
at 1 AU reasonably well. This result encourages us to
seek further opportunities to apply the method to ob-
served CME cases in the future. Interestingly, the best-ﬁt
αB =-1.6 stems independently from the analytical model of
Démoulin & Dasso (2009), which treats CMEs as expand-
ing force-free magnetic ﬂux ropes in equilibrium with the
total pressure of the ambient solar wind.

In the following, we summarize our assumptions and
simpliﬁcations that could represent areas of future method
improvements. We used AR helicity values taken from
Tziotziou et al. (2012), which were calculated via the
Georgoulis et al. (2012) method. Several methods exist to
calculate Hm (Section 2.1). Application of these methods
to the same data set, i.e., a sequence of HMI vector magne-
tograms, spanning over a two-day period (6 - 7) of March
2012 for the supereruptive NOAA AR 11429, showed that
the Hm determinations, even thought they stem from very
diﬀerent methods, show an overall agreement within a fac-
tor ∼ 2.5 (Tziotziou et al., 2016, in preparation). In addi-
tion, while the employed Hm values refer to entire ARs, it
is known that no AR sheds its entire helicity budget in a
single eruption; it is more appropriate to attribute a frac-
tion of the helicity budget to eruptions. This fraction seems
to be relatively small, typically one order of magnitude less,
but can be up to 40% of the total helicity budget in some
models (e.g., Kliem et al. 2011; Moraitis et al. 2014). Nev-
ertheless, as a ﬁrst-order approximation, the used AR-wide
Hm value should not dramatically overestimate the CME
magnetic ﬁeld in our analysis, given the large dispersion of
helicity values (∼3 orders of magnitude) and the large num-
ber of synthetic CMEs (104). In future works, nonetheless,
it is meaningful to search for eruption-related Hm changes
that should then be attributed to the ensuing CME.

As observed in coronagraph ﬁeld of view, CMEs have
curved fronts. In Section 2.1 we nonetheless assumed
a straight, cylindrically shaped CME front. This is be-
cause the employed ﬂux-rope model is cylindrical. However,
CMEs may ﬂatten during IP propagation (e.g., Savani et al.
2010). At any rate, adopting a curved CME-front shape
most likely introduces a (small) scaling factor in the de-
rived B∗ distributions.

In the parametric model of Section 4, we assumed that
the distributions of the magnetic (Hm) and geometrical pa-
rameters (α and κ) are statistically independent, that is,
they do not exhibit statistical correlations. This may be
not entirely true.

In spite of the agreement found, the FWHM range of
αB values still allows ∼30 % of the projected B1AU values

to lie outside the observed BMC value range (Figure 5).
For example, there is a high-B1AU tail that is not present
in the observations (Figure 4). This suggests that our sin-
gle (and simple) power-law description of the radial evolu-
tion of CME-ICME magnetic ﬁeld of Equation 8 may re-
quire future improvement. In particular, it is possible that
the CME magnetic ﬁeld experiences a stronger radial de-
cay closer to the Sun, hence a single-power law description
may not be entirely realistic. In addition, CMEs-ICMEs
could experience magnetic erosion during their IP travel
(e.g., Dasso et al. 2006; Ruﬀenach et al. 2015), and they
may thus end up with reduced magnetic ﬁelds at 1 AU.
Finally, while excessively high MC magnetic ﬁelds are only
very rarely reported (e.g., Liu et al. 2014), the lowest B1AU
values, below the lower limit of the BMC distribution, may
call for complex processes in the IP medium that could en-
force the magnetic ﬁeld of an ICME. This could be a CME-
CME interaction, for example, or an interaction between a
CME and trailing fast solar wind streams (e.g., Lugaz et al.
2008; Shen et al. 2011; Harrison et al. 2012; Temmer et al.
2012; Liu et al. 2014; Lugaz et al. 2014).

Clearly, more detailed analysis is required to tackle
the above issues. Such a major task would be the appli-
cation of the method to a set of carefully selected, well-
observed CME-ICME cases, where both photospheric cov-
erage would be suﬃcient and detailed GCS modeling would
exist, along with satisfactory MC measurements at L1. This
exercise would also aim to attribute eruption-related helic-
ity changes to CMEs, hence tackling issues (1), (2) above.
In addition, it would enable one to determine whether mag-
netic and geometrical parameters are correlated, therefore
addressing issue (3) above. Further theoretical and model-
ing work is required to understand the radial evolution of
CME-ICME magnetic ﬁelds, hence tackling issue (4) above.
One such avenue would be to to analyze simulations of CME
propagation in the IP medium and monitor the evolution
of their magnetic ﬁelds with heliocentric distance, and at
the same time investigating whether and how αB depends
on CME properties (e.g., speed, width), background solar
wind (e.g., speed, density), and IP magnetic ﬁeld. Here we
treated αB in a rather ad hoc manner; however, αB appears
as the single most important parameter for describing the
ICME magnetic ﬁeld at 1 AU, which apparently enables
one to encapsulate most of the relevant physics into a sim-
ple form of self-similar IP expansion. That said, one should
not dismiss the role of the near-Sun CME magnetic ﬁeld
in the determination of the ICME magnetic ﬁeld at 1 AU.
We also need observational inferences of this important pa-
rameter at suﬃcient numbers and our proposed method is
one such promising avenue. Our framework may be gen-
eralized to non-force-free states (e.g., Hidalgo et al. 2002;
Chen 2012; Berdichevsky 2013; Subramanian et al. 2014;
Patsourakos et al. 2016; Nieves-Chinchilla et al. 2016) and
cylindrical geometries
(e.g.,
Janvier et al. 2013; Vandas & Romashets 2015) provided
that the existence of explicit relationships connect its geo-
metrical (R and L) and magnetic (Hm) parameters. Ulti-
mately, we will perform the most meaningful tests of the
two central parameters, B∗ and αB, and key assumptions
of our model, when pristine observations by the two forth-
coming, ﬂagship heliophysics missions, Solar Orbiter and
Solar Probe Plus, become available.
