ABSTRACT

Magnetic imprints, the rapid and irreversible evolution of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds as a feedback from ﬂares
in the corona, have been conﬁrmed by many previous studies. These studies showed that the horizontal ﬁeld
will permanently increase at the polarity inversion line (PIL) after eruptions, indicating that a more horizontal
geometry of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld is produced. In this study, we analyze 20 X-class ﬂares since the
launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in 15 active regions (ARs) with heliographic angle no greater
than 45◦. We observe clear magnetic imprints in 16 ﬂares, whereas 4 ﬂares are exceptional. The imprint regions
of the horizontal ﬁeld are located not only at the PIL but also at sunspot penumbra with strong vertical ﬁelds.
Making use of the observed mass and speed of the corresponding coronal mass ejections (CMEs) , we ﬁnd
that the CMEs with larger momentums are associated with stronger magnetic imprints. Furthermore, a linear
relationship, with a Kendall’s Tau-b coefﬁcient 0.54, between the CME momentum and the change of Lorentz
force is revealed. Based on that, we quantify the back reaction time to be ∼70 s, with a 90% conﬁdence interval
from about 50 s to 90 s.

1. INTRODUCTION

Regarded as a rapid energy release process by virtue of
magnetic reconnection in the solar corona (Kopp & Pneuman
1976), major solar ﬂares are usually associated with coronal
mass ejections (CMEs).
It is known that long-term evolu-
tion of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld plays an essential role in
storing the energy responsible for the ﬂares. However, since
the corona is much more tenuous than the photosphere, it
has been thought for a long time that solar ﬂares cannot in-
ﬂuence the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds, especially in short-
term evolution.

The ﬁrst observational evidence of rapid/irreversible ﬂare-
related change of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld was re-
ported by Wang (1992) and Wang et al. (1994). A strong
and permanent increase of the magnetic shear at the polarity
inversion line (PIL) was found. Subsequently, Wang et al.
(2002) found that the rapid permanent changes of photo-
spheric magnetic ﬁelds associated with six X-class ﬂares.
A survey covering ﬁfteen major X-class ﬂares undertaken
by Sudol & Harvey (2005) concluded that the line-of-sight
(LOS) magnetic ﬁeld always changes during X-class ﬂares.
The above studies were based on magnetic ﬁelds observed by
ground-based telescopes.

Nevertheless, ground-based observations have rarely pro-
vided time series of magnetograms covering the ﬂare time
with a sufﬁciently high cadence. On the other hand, pre-
vious studies are mostly based on the LOS magnetic ﬁeld
data that are actually a combination of both the horizontal
component and the radial one. This makes the interpreta-
tion of the results more challenging. This intrinsic limitation
was solved with high-cadence photospheric vector magnetic
ﬁeld data (Hoeksema et al. 2014) acquired by the Helio-
seismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) ,
which was successfully launched aboard the Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). Since then,
many more ﬂare events showing rapid and irreversible im-
prints on photospheric magnetic ﬁeld were found (Wang et al.
2012a, Wang et al. 2012b; Sun et al. 2012; Petrie 2012,
Petrie 2013; Song & Zhang 2016). Ye et al. (2016) ob-
served the rapid/permanent change of photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld in a circular-ribbon ﬂare, which is associated with the
magnetic reconnection of a three-dimensional magnetic null
point (Wang & Liu 2012; Masson et al. 2009, 2017; Yang
et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015). Sun et al. (2017) studied on
the magnetic imprints for a sample of X-class ﬂares using
the recently-released SDO/HMI high-cadence vector magne-
tograms. The main ﬁndings of previous studies are that the
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld tends to increase at the PIL, indi-
cating that vector magnetic ﬁeld tends to be more horizontal
after ﬂare eruptions. Theoretically, the tether-cutting model
(Moore et al. 2001) and the coronal implosion model (Hud-

Figure 1. X1.8 ﬂare on 2014 December 20. Panels (a) and (b) show the change in the magnitude of the horizontal ﬁeld (the color map), |δBh|,
with a threshold 100 G, during and after the solar ﬂare. The areas with a change, |δBh|, greater than 100 G, 200 G and 300 G are marked in
yellow, orange and red respectively. In panel (a), we show the difference map of Bh in ﬂare stage (from 00:12 UT to 01:00 UT). In panel (b), we
plot the difference map of Bh in post-ﬂare stage (from 03:12 UT to 04:00 UT, three hours after ﬂare stage). The background gray map shows
the radial magnetic ﬁeld Br scaled between ±2000G, where |Br|= 1000 G and 2000 G are contoured using green line and blue line respectively.
The white line shows the smoothed PIL, where Br= 0 G. The red box encloses the region (Region 1) with ﬂare-associated enhancement of Bh at
the Polarity Inversion Line (PIL); the blue box encloses the region (Region 2) with such change at penumbra. Panel (c) is the difference map of
horizontal ﬁeld, with contrast strengthened. Panel (d) is an AIA 1600 Å map around ﬂare peak time. In panels (e)–(h), we plot the eight-hours
evolution of the weighted mean horizontal ﬁeld and weighted mean magnetic inclination of ROI (the colored areas inside Region 1 and Region
2), where gray dashed lines mark start, peak and end time of the ﬂare. The vertical error bars are calculated through error transfer formula.

son 2000) have been referred to explain this process.

Although previous observations have revealed many obser-
vational aspects of the imprints of solar ﬂares, the results are
still not conclusive and thus more statistical studies are re-
quired. A statistical work for 18 ﬂare events from 4 Active
Regions (ARs) was conducted by Wang et al. (2012b). Petrie
(2012) studied six major ﬂare events in detail and Sun et al.
(2017) investigated nine X-class ﬂares.
It should be men-
tioned that the events in these studies are overlapping and
mainly belong to major eruptions from a small number of
distinct active regions: AR 11158, 11166, 11283 and 11429.
Thus, to avoid selection bias, we conduct a comprehensive
survey of all the X-class ﬂares with heliographic angle no
greater than 45° since SDO’s launch.

As for the cause of the magnetic imprints, Fisher et al.
(2012) considered the net Lorentz force acting on the upper
solar atmosphere, and equate it (with an opposite direction)
with the net Lorentz force acting on the interior of the Sun.
Meanwhile, the downward momentum incurred by Lorentz
force should equal to the upward momentum of the erupting
plasma. Based on this theory, Wang et al. (2012b) estimated
the CME mass by assuming that the back reaction time is of

order of 10 s. In this work, we investigate the relationship be-
tween CME momentum and change of the the Lorentz force,
where we will elucidate that change of the Lorentz force can
serve as an indicator of the strength of the magnetic imprint.
Moreover, instead of an empirical estimation, we give a more
exact evaluation of the reaction time, which is an important
parameter in understanding the reaction process.

Our motivations for this study are fourfold: (1) to inves-
tigate the general properties of ﬂares’ imprints on the pho-
tosphere; (2) to ﬁgure out the location of the imprints and
categorize them; (3) to quantitatively describe the change of
magnetic ﬁeld including horizontal ﬁeld change and inclina-
tion angle change; and (4) to further study the relationship
between CMEs and the imprints on the photosphere. In Sec-
tion 2, we describe the observations and the data processing
procedure for 20 events with AR 12242 as an example. The
statistical results for the magnetic ﬁeld change are presented
in Section 3, together with the relationship between the CME
momentum and the change of Lorentz force. We ﬁnally make
a discussion and summary in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION

For the events occurring near the solar limb, when com-
pared with those near the disk center, observational noise
level is typically higher; moreover, it is harder to spatially
resolve small structures of solar ﬂares since a pixel covers a
larger area of the solar surface. Therefore, to guarantee the
reliability of our study, we only study the near-disk center
X-class ﬂares with heliographic angle no greater than 45°.
We scrutinize the whole list of X-class ﬂares123, from SDO’s
launch in 2010 to 2017 June 28, and select 20 ﬂare events
from 15 ARs (listed in Table 1). The GOES X-ray classes of
the sample ﬂares ranges from X1.0 to X5.4, which is to date

the largest sample for studying magnetic imprints of X-class
ﬂares since SDO’s launch. Most importantly, we do not make
other subjective selection criteria than setting a threshold for
the ﬂare class and heliographic angle of the ﬂare site, which
avoids bias in the statistical results.

HMI and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. 2012) on board SDO provide full-disk vector magnetic
ﬁelds and Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) images, respectively,
with high spatial and temporal resolutions. More speciﬁ-
cally, we trace the morphology of ﬂare ribbons using the
AIA images at wavelength 1600 Å, with a cadence of 24
s (aia.lev1_uv_24s4). HMI acquires full-disk photospheric
magnetograms with a pixel size of 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) at a cadence of 12
minutes. The magnetic ﬁeld is inverted from the Stokes
parameters at six wavelengths distributed around the pho-

tospheric FeI 6173 Å line5. The 180° azimuthal ambiguity
is resolved through the "minimum energy" method (Metcalf
1994; Leka et al. 2009). The noise level of the LOS ﬁeld
measurement is about 10 G; the noise level of the transverse
ﬁeld is of the order of 100 G (Liu et al. 2012). In this work,
we use the vector magnetogram Spaceweather HMI Active
Region Patch (SHARP), where the ARs are automatically
identiﬁed and extracted. We obtained the three components
of the vector magnetic ﬁelds, Br, Bp, Bt from the deprojected
maps provided in the cylindrical equal area (CEA) coordinate
system (hmi.sharp_cea_720s6; Bobra et al. 2014).

As mentioned above, solar ﬂares’ imprints on the photo-
sphere are mainly reﬂected by the irreversible increase of
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld, Bh =
t , at the PIL. Thus,
for all events under study, we merely focus on the regions
with magnetic ﬁeld changes that meet two criteria:

p + B2

(cid:113)

B2

1. A signiﬁcant increase of Bh is detected during the so-
lar ﬂare. To avoid unreal enhancement of Bh arising
from noise, we set a threshold of increase, 100 G, the
contour of which is marked in yellow.

2. The increase of Bh is temporally associated with solar
ﬂares. To get rid of non-ﬂare-associated ﬁeld changes,
such as emerging ﬂux or moving magnetic features
(See Hagenaar & Shine 2005; Iida et al. 2012), we also
calculate the change of Bh in the post-ﬂare stage, de-
ﬁned at an equal duration interval starting three hours
after the start time of the ﬂare. If Bh increases during
the ﬂare but does not increase after the ﬂare, the in-
crease is regarded to be associated with solar ﬂares.
The boundary of ﬂare-associated increase of Bh is
marked by red or blue boxes.

Therefore, we deﬁne the regions of interest (ROI) as the re-
gions that meet both the two criteria above, visually, the col-
ored areas inside the boxes.

To demonstrate the procedure of data processing, we take
the analysis of the sample with the most complex imprint as
an example: the X1.8 ﬂare in AR 12242. Firstly, we scru-
tinize the evolution of the horizontal ﬁeld and plot the dif-
ference map between ﬂare start time and end times (deﬁned
based on the recorded start and end times of GOES soft X-
ray emission), as is seen in Figure 1(c). Secondly, as seen

5 http://jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/VectorMagneticField

6 http://jsoc.stanford.edu/ajax/lookdata.html?ds=hmi.sharp_cea_720s

in Figure 1(a) and (b), we plot the radial magnetic ﬁeld, Br,
as the background, on which the regions with difference val-
ues, δBh, greater than 100 G, 200G and 300 G, are marked
in yellow, orange and red respectively. Panel (a) shows the
difference map during the ﬂare; while panel (b) shows the
difference map three hours after the ﬂare. Here, with a fo-
cus on the rapid/irreversible change of Bh during ﬂare time,
we consider the post-ﬂare change as the non-ﬂare-associated
change. Visually, we exclude the non-ﬂare-associated change
out of the difference map of Bh in ﬂare stage, then keep the
remaining regions as ﬂare-associated change, as marked by
boxes. Therefore, the colored areas inside the boxes in Fig-
ure 1(a) are ROI as deﬁned aforementioned. We can see
that, unlike the ﬂare-associated change of Bh, the non-ﬂare-
associated change of Bh is dispersed across the whole ﬁeld
of view. Considering its low amplitude and small area, we
regard the non-ﬂare-associated change as mostly from noise
or computational errors. In particular, we point out that the
increase of horizontal ﬁeld appears not only at the PIL, as
marked by the red box, but also at sunspot penumbra region,
where Br > 1000 G, as marked by the blue box.

We will show in Section 3 that such double-region increase
is not unique. There are other types of magnetic imprints.
Thirdly, since we are interested in the spatial relationship
between magnetic imprints and ﬂare ribbons, we show the
AIA image of ﬂare region at 1600 Å in Figure 1(d). We can
ﬁnd that, spatially, region R1 is located mainly between the
two ﬂare ribbons, whereas region R2 is located partially on
the ﬂare ribbon. Note that the coordinates of SHARP maps
have been transformed to helioprojective-Cartesian coordi-
nates for comparison with AIA map. Finally, we plot the
evolution of weighted mean change of the horizontal ﬁeld
and that of the inclination angle within the ROI as a function
of time. The deﬁnitions of these parameters are as follows:

(cid:104) Bh (cid:105) =

(cid:104) φ (cid:105) =

(cid:80)

ROI |B| · Bh
(cid:80)
ROI |B|

(cid:80)

ROI |B| · φ
(cid:80)
ROI |B|

(2)

Here, for better comparison with previous studies, we fol-
low the deﬁnition of the magnetic inclination angle φ in
Wang et al. (2012a): φ = arctan
. As shown in Fig-

is worth pointing out that because of the ﬂare heating, the
inversions of Stokes proﬁles are generally not reliable dur-
ing the ﬂare (Hong et al. 2018), which further brings un-
certainty to the magnetograms of HMI. Nevertheless, inver-
sions of Stokes proﬁles are reliable before and after the ﬂare,
during which the quantities Bh and φ almost keep constant.
Thus, despite of the uncertainty during the ﬂare, the irre-
versible/stepwise change of Bh and φ seems realistic. We also

compare the region at the PIL and the region at the penumbra.
It is found that the changes of the horizontal ﬁeld are simi-
lar in the two regions; however, the change of the inclination
angle in the PIL region is greater than that in the penumbra
region. This result can be expected due to a stronger Br ﬁeld
in the latter. Note that the errors in (cid:104)Bh(cid:105) and (cid:104)φ(cid:105) are calcu-
lated according to the error transfer formula.

To further reveal the origin of such an irreversible change
of the magnetic ﬁeld, we analyze the relationship between the
CME momentum and the Lorentz force change as predicted
by Fisher et al. (2012). The change in the vertical compo-
nent of the net Lorentz force acting on the volume below the
photosphere is formulated as:

δFr =

1
8π

(cid:90)

Aph

dA (δB2

r − δB2
h).

(3)

We note that, similar to previous results (Wang et al. 2012b,
Song & Zhang 2016, Sun et al. 2017), the vertical ﬁeld
Br shows no rapid change in the time duration of 8 hours.
Therefore, we omit the term δB2
r and calculate δFr in the
ROI depending solely on the term δB2
h, which means that the
Lorentz force change can serve as a reasonable indicator of
the strength of the magnetic imprints, namely:

δFr

7 ≈

1
8π

(cid:90)

AROI

dA (−δB2

h).

(4)

On the other hand, we estimate the CME momentum by di-
rectly multiplying the CME mass by the linear speed of the
CME as observed by the SOHO satellite8.

For each X-class ﬂare, we pay attention to a time period of
eight hours. We then apply the same procedure to all the 20
ﬂare events as listed in Table 1. The detailed CME informa-
tion and the change of the vertical Lorentz force are recorded
in Table 2.

3. STATISTICAL RESULTS

Following the same data reduction procedure as introduced
in Section 2, we are able to plot the magnetic imprints as
shown in Figures 2–4.

So far, many authors have given observational evidence
of the type of magnetic imprint whose horizontal ﬁeld ir-
reversibly increased at the PIL (Wang et al. 2012a, Wang
et al. 2012b; Sun et al. 2012; Petrie 2012, Petrie 2013; Song
& Zhang 2016), with a comprehensible physical interpreta-
tion (Hudson 2000; Moore et al. 2001; Fisher et al. 2012).
However, for other types of magnetic imprints, more obser-
vational and theoretical discussions are needed before we can
completely understand them. In this sense, according to the
spatial distribution of the ROI, more exactly, at PIL or not,
we are able to categorize the magnetic imprints of 20 X-Class
ﬂares into three types:

7 For convenience, the δFr used in statistical study means the decrease of

Lorentz force, which is the absolute value of that in Equations (3) and (4).

aInformation of the CME time is from the SOHO catalog.

bThe CME momentums are computed by multiplying the CME mass and CME speed.

1. Type I: Bh increases at the PIL only, where there is
a contiguous area of increasing Bh that encompasses
a PIL. In these events, we can identify a continuous
area with a strong enhancement of the horizontal ﬁeld
covering the PIL and the main ﬂare region revealed by
the 1600 Å AIA images, which is in agreement with
previous results. Most of the events belong to this type.

2. Type II: Bh increases both at the PIL and the penumbra,
where there is a contiguous area of increasing Bh that
encompasses a PIL, as well as a contiguous area of
increasing Bh inside a penumbra. In a small number of
events, besides the area at PIL, we can also identify a
continuous area with enhanced horizontal ﬁeld at the
penumbra, where the vertical magnetic ﬁeld is greater
than 1000 G. The events occurring in AR 11520, AR
12158 and AR 12242 belong to this type.

3. Type III: Bh increases in a separate and irregular way,
spatially with little relation with the PIL. Meanwhile,
as shown in Figure 4, such changes also occur after
the ﬂare; so there is no temporal association with the
ﬂare. Although we cannot exclude the relationship be-
tween the increases of Bh and solar ﬂares, the colored
regions (with an increase of Bh greater than 100 G) are
identiﬁed as non-ﬂare-related and mostly from noise or
measurement errors. One X-class event in AR 11944
and three events in 12192 belong to this type.

Therefore, we reach the following statistical results: (1)
16 out of 20 events embed clear magnetic imprints; 1 sam-
ple in AR 11944 and 3 samples in AR 12192 are exceptional
(Type III); (2) among the 16 ﬂares with magnetic imprints,

13 events embed imprints only at the PIL as reported be-
fore, while 3 embed imprints both at the PIL and the sunspot
penumbra; (3) the ROI in red boxes (Type I and R1 in Type
II) spatially covered the ﬂaring PIL, as revealed by the AIA
data; the ROI in blue boxes (R2 in Type II) are located on the
ﬂare ribbons.

In addition to the above qualitative results, we further make
a quantitative study on the change of the horizontal ﬁeld, δBh,
and that of the inclination angle, δφ, in all marked boxes
for the 16 events of Type I and Type II, as well as the pa-
rameters for the associated CME events. Note that, consid-
ering the poor relation between increase of horizontal ﬁeld
with solar ﬂares, such quantitative statistics do not include
the events in Type III. We calculate the mean values of Bh, φ
before the ﬂare eruption9, denoted as (cid:104) Bh (cid:105)pre and (cid:104) φ (cid:105)pre,
and the mean values of Bh and φ after the eruption, denoted
as (cid:104) Bh (cid:105)post, and (cid:104) φ (cid:105)post. The difference values of them,
(cid:104) δBh (cid:105) and (cid:104) δφ (cid:105), are listed in Table 1. The errors in the ta-
ble are calculated from error transfer formula. Since we are
interested in the relationship between the magnetic imprints
and the CME, we are able to plot the quantities describing
the magnetic imprints in dependence of the CME momen-
tum. The CME momentum of the ﬂares in AR 11430, AR
11890 (2013.11.08) and AR 12158 are not available; so we
do not show the three events in Figure 5. As can be seen in
Figure 5(a)–(b), the ratio of change of the horizontal ﬁeld,
(cid:104) Bh (cid:105)post −(cid:104) Bh (cid:105)pre
, ranges from ∼ 20% to ∼ 80%, with an aver-
(cid:104) Bh (cid:105)pre
age value of ∼40%. Note that, given the size of error bars,

ﬁve times instants immediately prior/posterior to the start/end time.

the ﬂares in our sample are X-class ones. The change ratio
should be different in other ﬂares with lower classes. The
ratio of change of the inclination angle, (cid:104) φ (cid:105)post −(cid:104) φ (cid:105)pre
, is no
greater than 25%. No evident relationship can be seen be-
tween the CME momentum and the ratio of change of Bh or
φ.

So far,

there are some limitations in our method.
Firstly, our method cannot completely remove the non-ﬂare-
associated change from the raw difference map. We visually
exclude the non-ﬂare-associated change area by excluding
the δBh at post-ﬂare stage and that at ﬂare stage. However,
inside the boxes, we cannot remove the non-ﬂare-associated
contribution of δBh from the ROI, which means that the mag-
netic ﬁeld change in our statistics may still contain some non-
ﬂare-associated changes. Meanwhile, for the events whose
magnetic imprints are not completely centralized at the PIL,
some changes might be neglected outside the boxes. Sec-
ondly, similar to the deﬁnition of ROI in Wang et al. (2012b),
our temporal requirement of ROI that the horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld should increase over 100 G during the time interval from
the ﬂare onset to the end of ﬂare end is empirical. It still re-
mains to be tested whether this is always the case.

The another objective of this paper is to test the relation-
ship between the CME eruption and the change of the hori-
zontal ﬁeld. Considering the momentum conservation, it is
natural to expect that an upward CME will result in a down-
ward momentum impulse, which may lead to a change of
magnetic ﬁeld in the photosphere. According to the model of
Fisher et al. (2012), the momentum equation is:

MCME v =

1
2

δFr δt,

(5)

where δFr is the change of the Lorentz force acting on the
photosphere (the absolute value10 determined by Equation
(3)), MCME is the CME mass and v is the CME speed, both
of which are available from the SOHO CME catalog11, and
δt is the reaction time of the physical process. When using
this expression, we grossly assume that the entire mass of
the CME moves with the same velocity, and that the work
done against gravity is ignored. Another assumption is made
that the Lorentz force changes linearly during the time inter-
val δt, which results in the factor 1
2 in equation (5). Since
the theory behind the increase at the penumbra is unclear, we
only study the regions of Type I and the R1 regions of Type
II. Therefore, the value of “back reaction” time, δt, can be
derived from the linear relationship between the CME mo-
mentum and the change of Lorentz force, δFr, (see Figure
5(c)), whose slope equals to 2
δt . The value of δt of our sam-
ples is then calculated to be ∼ 70 s, with the 90% conﬁdence

the 90% conﬁdence interval being [2.3, 3.7] (×10−2 s−1). The uncer-
tainty of the slope is calculated by the bootstrap method with 50,000
iterations.

except the events in AR 11166, 12297 and 11520 (R1), the
ratio of change of the horizontal ﬁeld at PIL (red boxes) tend
to be a constant of ∼40%, whereas the ratio of change of
horizontal ﬁeld at penumbra (blue boxes) tend to be ∼20%.
We suspect that these high values are due to the fact that all

interval being about 50 s to 90 s. Our estimation of back re-
action time is longer than the rough estimation of 10 s given
by Wang et al. (2012b). One thing should be pointed out that,
in reality, the Lorentz force may not change linearly. If the
change is initially more rapid than a linear change, the factor
in Equation (5) will larger than 1
2 ; if the change is initially
slower than a linear change, the factor will be smaller than
1
2 . This could explain the fairly large dispersion of the data
points from the linear ﬁtting in Figure 5(c).

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

After a statistical study of a sample of X-class ﬂares with
heliographic angle no greater than 45° since SDO’s launch,
and further quantitative measurement of key parameters re-
lated to the magnetic ﬁeld change, we reach the the main
conclusions as follows.

First, most but not all the X-class solar ﬂares would im-
plement magnetic imprints at PIL on the photosphere. In our
samples of 20 ﬂares, we observe that the horizontal ﬁeld in
one ﬂare event in AR 11944 and three ﬂare events in AR
12192 nearly remain unchanged at PIL during the ﬂare time,
similar to the behavior in the post-ﬂare time (see Figure 4).
Our statistical study aims to explore the question presented
by Sun et al. (2017): are the magnetic imprints universal?
The four aforementioned Type III examples suggest that the
magnetic imprints may not be universal in X-class ﬂares,
where categorization of the magnetic imprints is necessary.
We still need to explore whether the universality exists in M-
class or C-class ﬂares.

Second, we ﬁnd that the magnetic imprints of X-class
ﬂares are located not only at the PIL (see Wang et al. 2012a;
Song & Zhang 2016; Sun et al. 2017) but also at the penum-
bra in some cases (see Region 2 in Figure 3(e)–(f)); or not
at PIL (see Figure 4). This new ﬁnding needs to be checked
with more observations and awaits a theoretical explanation.
We need to clarify how the change at the penumbra is related
to the magnetic imprints that are usually found at the PIL, as
it is not easily explained by the tether-cutting model (Moore
et al. 2001).

Third, we quantitatively evaluate the change of the hori-
zontal ﬁeld, inclination angle and the time duration of mag-
netic imprint process. As is seen in Table 1 and Figure 5, It
is found that the increase of the horizontal ﬁeld ranges from

150 G to 450 G, and that the decrease of the inclination an-
gle ranges from 1° to 10°. These quantitative constrain the
geometric change of the magnetic ﬁeld that has implications
in constructing the physical model behind magnetic imprints.
Fourth, we check the change of the Lorentz force on the
photosphere in the ROI, which is proportional to integration
of the δB2
h. We ﬁnd that this parameter is strongly correlated
with the CME momentum (see Figure 5(d)). It suggests that a
CME with a higher momentum is associated with a stronger
magnetic imprint on the photosphere. In this sense, in the
three X-ﬂares in AR 12192, where there is no or very small
CME momentum (also called as "conﬁned ﬂares" e.g. Ji et al.
2003), it is natural that we cannot see intensive magnetic im-
prints. Sun et al. (2015) interprets that the CMEs might be
restricted by strong background ﬁelds. However, in the X-
ﬂare in AR 11944, we also cannot see the intensive magnetic
imprint, regardless of very large momentum of the associated
CME (∼ 402.6×1017g · km · s−1, the highest among Table1).
This might be on account of its complex magnetic structure
and unusual CME motion (Möstl et al. 2015; Wang et al.
2015). Moreover, we have estimated the back reaction time
to be ∼ 70 s. As ﬁrst introduced by Wang et al. (2012b), since
we can calculate δFr and measure the CME speed, v, once we
know the key parameter back reaction time δt, we are able to
estimate the CME mass. Based on the above analysis, we
provide δt ∼ 70 s as a reference value for such CME mass
estimation. Here, the back reaction process is triggered by
the magnetic reconnection, during which CME is propelled
outward. The back reaction time, ∼ 70 s, is shorter than the
step-wise evolution time of the horizontal ﬁeld on the pho-
tosphere, which is typically ∼48 minutes. Nevertheless, the
physical nature of the reaction process is still unclear. In the
future, we need to check the observational data with even
higher cadence (Sun et al. 2017), and perform MHD simula-
tions for the eruptions, to understand the reaction process.
