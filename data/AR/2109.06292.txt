The low-lying excited states in the neutron-deﬁcient N = Z + 1 nucleus 87

43Tc44 have been studied
via the fusion-evaporation reaction 54Fe(36Ar, 2n1p)87Tc at the Grand Acc´el´erateur National d’Ions
Lourds (GANIL), France. The AGATA spectrometer was used in conjunction with the auxiliary
NEDA, Neutron Wall, and DIAMANT detector arrays to measure coincident prompt γ-rays, neu-
trons, and charged particles emitted in the reaction. A level scheme of 87Tc from the (9/2+
g.s.) state
to the (33/2+
1 ) state was established based on 6 mutually coincident γ-ray transitions. The con-
structed level structure exhibits a rotational behavior with a sharp backbending at ~ω ≈ 0.50 MeV.
A decrease in alignment frequency and increase in alignment sharpness in the odd-mass isotonic
chains around N = 44 is proposed as an eﬀect of the enhanced isoscalar neutron-proton interactions
in odd-mass nuclei when approaching the N = Z line.

Introduction. The nuclear pairing correlation is an es-
sential
ingredient for describing the properties of ﬁnite
atomic nuclei. The underlying mechanism is considered

to be analogous to that formulated in the Bardeen-Cooper-
Schrieﬀer (BCS) theory [1, 2]. Unique for the nuclear sys-
tem is that it is a strongly correlated system of two dif-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ferent types of fermions (neutrons and protons). Due to
isospin symmetry, the Cooper pairs can be formed in both
the T = 1 isovector (neutron-neutron, proton-proton, and
neutron-proton) channel and the T = 0 isoscalar (neutron-
proton) channel. A wealth of experimental observations
have supported the fundamental role of neutron-neutron
and proton-proton pairing correlations in understanding
various nuclear properties including mass, deformation,
moment of inertia and rotational alignment [3, 4]. The
eﬀect of T = 1 isovector neutron-proton (np) pairing has
also been analyzed from diﬀerent perspectives [5–9]. An in-
teresting problem that is still considered open is the exper-
imental evidence for the T = 0 isoscalar np pairing mode.
The possible existence of such deuteron-like pairing has at-
tracted extensive studies over the years [8–11].

It is expected that the eﬀects of isoscalar pairing can be
enhanced along the N = Z line where the valence neu-
trons and protons occupy identical orbitals, in particular
in the heaviest self-conjugate systems where many particles
might contribute to form an isoscalar pairing condensate.
In recent years, advances in detection and data acquisition
technologies have opened up the nuclei far from stability
to observation, and the newly unveiled spectroscopy data
in the intermediate-mass N ∼ Z region has reignited the
interest in investigating the possible manifestation of the
T = 0 pairing mode. The occurrence of a signiﬁcant com-
ponent of isoscalar spin-aligned np pairs in the nuclear wave
function is suggested in the heavy spherical N = Z nuclei
like 92Pd [11, 12]. The eﬀect of the competition between the
spin-aligned np pair interaction and the quadrupole correla-
tion could be strong even in the lighter, modestly deformed,
nucleus 88Ru [13, 14]. It is the response of the diﬀerent pair-
ing ﬁeld components to collective rotation [11, 15, 16] that
is of interest in such deformed systems. A possible conse-
quence of the increase in rotational frequency is that while
the T = 1 isovector pairs, which couple two nucleons to
J = 0, are successively destroyed by the increasing Coriolis
force, the T = 0 isoscalar pairs with J > 0 can align to
build up angular momentum [10] and thus may still leave
ﬁngerprints after the quenching of T = 1 pairing. The
ground-state rotational bands of even-even N = Z nuclei
from 72Kr to 88Ru [13, 17–19] have been extended to the
region where band crossings are normally expected, and in-
creases in crossing frequency compared to their neighboring
N > Z nuclei were consistently observed. These “delayed”
alignments have been widely suggested as arising from the
T = 0 np pairing correlation [20], though the eﬀect of the
shape degrees of freedom can muddle the analysis in some
cases.

The eﬀect of T = 0 np pairing correlations may be strong
also for N = Z + 1 nuclei even though the impact is
expected to diminish rapidly as one goes away from the
N = Z line [13].
In the rotational odd-mass nuclei, the
ﬁrst rotational alignment can be explicitly assigned to ei-
ther aligned neutrons or aligned protons due to the odd-
particle blocking in the isovector pairing ﬁeld. After the
crossing to the 3-quasiparticle band, due to the simulta-
neous presence of unpaired neutrons and protons at high

spin will be favored by the T = 0 np pairing ﬁeld.
In
the Tz = ±1/2 nuclei, such a competition may lead to a
transition between the two pairing phases.
[21],
it is argued that the negative parity bands in 73Kr can be
accounted for by means of T = 0 pair correlations. The
deformed region around 88Ru is an ideal laboratory to ver-
ify the condensation of isoscalar pairs due to the fact that
most valence particles are conﬁned in the high angular mo-
mentum g 9/2 orbital below the magic number N = Z = 50.
The intermediate-mass Tz = 1/2 nuclei have been mapped
up to 95Ag [22] with relatively rich spectroscopic informa-
tion. The exception is 87Tc, for which only two excited
states were previously known [23]. In this study, we report
on the observation of excited states in the yrast band of
87Tc from the (9/2+
1 ) state. The re-
sults are discussed based on the systematical studies and
compared with large-scale and single-j shell model calcu-
lations including the possible eﬀects from the T = 0 np
pairing correlation.

Experiment. The experiment was performed at the
Grand Acc´el´erateur National d’Ions Lourds (GANIL),
Caen, France. The reaction 54Fe(36Ar, 2n1p)87Tc was in-
duced by a 5 ∼ 10 pnA 36Ar beam at 115 MeV which
was led to bombard the 6 mg/cm2 thick 54Fe target foils.
Prompt γ rays from the de-excitation of the rare 87Tc nuclei
produced in the reaction were measured with the Advanced
Gamma Tracking Array (AGATA) [24] spectrometer con-
sisting of 11 triple-cluster segmented HPGe detectors [25].
The indispensable channel selection was achieved by oper-
ating AGATA in conjunction with auxiliary detector sys-
tems for light particles. Evaporated charged particles were
recorded in the DIAMANT [26, 27] detector array con-
sisting of 60 CsI(Tl) scintillators placed inside the target
chamber. In the forward hemisphere, with approximately
1.6π solid angle coverage, the NEDA [28, 29] and Neutron
Wall [30] detector arrays, consisting of 54 and 42 organic
liquid scintillator detectors, respectively, were placed to de-
tect the emitted neutrons. AGATA was calibrated with
a standard 152Eu radioactive source giving a 0.095% σ/E
resolution for the 1408.1 keV γ-ray transition. The trigger
condition in the experiment required at least 1 (NEDA or
Neutron Wall) neutron and 2 (AGATA) γ-ray detectors to
ﬁre in coincidence.

In the oﬀ-line analysis, γ-ray events belonging to the
2n1p channel were identiﬁed by using the information on
the detected light particles. The γ-γ coincidence matrix
for 87Tc was sorted with the condition of “2n01p”, which
means that two neutrons together with either none or one
proton had to be detected in prompt coincidence. The ac-
ceptance of “0p” events is mainly due to the low single-
proton detection eﬃciency of only about 39(1)%.
In or-
der to suppress the contamination from 1n channels, a pu-
riﬁcation of the “2n” events was performed by rejecting
the neutron-scattering events using the time-of-ﬂight of the
detected neutrons and the positions of the detectors that
ﬁred. The requirement of “01p” events was either a com-
plete silence of the whole DIAMANT array or the only

signal must be assigned to a proton.

those in the neighboring technetium isotopes 89,91,93Tc are
shown in Fig. 2. The N = 44 isotones show a characteris-
tic rotational behavior while a strong transition to spherical
coupling is observed along the Tc isotopic chain as one ap-
proaches N = 50. In the semi-magic nucleus 93Tc, the level
pattern up to 21/2+
1 is of a typical spherical π(g 9/2)3 mul-
tiplet character. Here, a sudden and signiﬁcant increase in
the excitation energy is seen for the 25/2+
1 state which in-
volves the excitation and breaking of a proton pair and has
the conﬁguration π(g 9/2)5
25/2. As expected, the energy gaps
between the 25/2+
1 states are reduced in 89,91Tc
in the presence of both valence protons and neutrons. In
the middle of the ν(g 9/2) subshell, the level pattern of 87Tc
is characterized by a fully developed rotational band similar
to the other N = 44 isotones.

1 and 21/2+

Focusing on the rotational patterns of the N = 44 iso-
tones with Tz = 5/2 (83Y), 3/2 (85Nb), and 1/2 (87Tc),
a gradual decrease in the collectivity of the 1-quasiparticle
(1-qp) bands from 83Y to 87Tc may be expected as can
be inferred from the increasing gap between the 9/2+
1 and
13/2+
1 states. On the other hand, the higher-spin states
starting from J = 21/2 clearly show an opposite trend.
In order to clarify this striking feature we have extracted
the kinematic moments of inertia, J (1) [31], as a function
of rotational frequency for the N = 44 isotones from 83Y
to 88Ru, as illustrated in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). The even-
even N = 44 isotones 84Zr [32] and 86Mo [33] show a g 9/2
proton alignment at ~ω ≈ 0.48 MeV followed by a neu-
tron crossing around 0.6 MeV and 0.5 MeV, respectively.
All odd-A isotones in the ﬁgure show νg9/2 quasiparticle
alignments [34, 35] around ~ω = 0.5 MeV with a clear
and unexpected increases in the crossing sharpness with
the decrease of Tz. The ﬁrst alignment in the even-even
nuclei shows an upward trend in frequency from Z = 42 to
44. The considerably “delayed” alignment in self-conjugate
88
44Ru44 was suggested to be associated with isoscalar pair-

FIG. 4. Left: The experimental level scheme of 87Tc in com-
parison with the shell-model calculations in the pg model space
based on the slgmt0 [38] interaction (slgmt0* denotes the calcu-
lation with the spin-aligned neutron-proton interaction reduced
by 200 keV). The cartoon illustrates the coupling between the
unpaired neutron with the spin-aligned np pair which is the
dominant component of the wave function for the higher-spin
states. Right: Kinematic moments of inertia as a function of

ing correlations [13, 14]. Considering now also the N = 43
isotones with Tz = 5/2 (81Sr), 3/2 (83Zr), and 1/2 (85Mo)
(see Fig. 3 (c)), all the odd-mass isotones reveal the same
trend: the band crossings become earlier and sharper when
approaching the N = Z line regardless of the nature of
these alignments.

In Fig. 4 (left), we compare the observed level scheme
of 87Tc with those from shell-model calculations in the pg
model space based on the eﬀective interaction slgmt0 [38].
A calculation in the large-scale f pg space with the inter-
action jun45 [37] was also performed and no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between calculations in the two model spaces
is expected since the wave functions for those states are
dominated by the occupation of the g9/2 orbitals. A slight
modiﬁcation of the lowest-lying states may be expected by
the inclusion of the d5/2 orbital as was shown in the case of
the even-even 88Ru [14]. For the higher-lying states from
spin J = 25/2, our calculations indicate that the coupling
πg9/2 ⊗ (πνg9/2)9 is strongly favored in energy in relation
to the fact that the spin-aligned np pairs are more strongly
attractive than other pairs, as discussed in [12, 13, 39]. It
leads to a fully aligned 3-qp-like structure at the 25/2+
1
state as a result of the coupling between one unpaired neu-
tron and a spin-aligned np pair formed by the last odd pro-
ton and the other unpaired neutron. Higher-lying states
can be built on top of that by the coupling to additional
valence np pairs. To illustrate this picture, as in Ref. [39],
we have redone our shell-model calculations in the pg and
f pg model spaces by reducing the strength of the spin-
aligned np pair interaction. As an example, in the right
part of Fig. 4 we have plotted calculations in the pg space
with the (g9/2)2
J=9 spin-aligned np pair interaction matrix
element reduced slightly by 200 keV (denoted as slgmt0*).

4

The reduced np pair matrix element leads to an increase in
the excitation energy for the higher-spin states much more
signiﬁcant than that of the low-lying states due to the en-
hanced np pair coupling in their wave function. The incre-
ment is as much as 133 keV for the 25/2+
1 state and nearly
200 keV for the states with higher spin. Our calculations
furthermore show that the eﬀect is much less pronounced
when one goes away from N = Z. For example, in 89Tc,
calculation with the same reduced np pair matrix element
leads only to a change of only 70 keV in the excitation en-
ergy of its 25/2+
1 state. That is because the spin-aligned
np pair plays even larger role in 87Tc than in 89Tc. The
experimental kinematic moments of inertia as a function of
rotational frequency for 87Tc and 89Tc are compared with
the shell-model calculations in Fig. 4 (right). The results
of the calculations illustrate the importance of the spin-
aligned neutron-proton coupling for the Tz = 1/2 nucleus
87Tc as compared with 89Tc (Tz = 3/2). In the latter case
a reduction of the spin-aligned neutron-proton interaction
energy by 200 keV has little inﬂuence on its structure.

Based on the results above, we suggest that the en-
hancement of the isoscalar np correlations approaching the
N = Z line will make such spin-aligned states more energet-
ically favored, leading to an increasing collectivity after the
band crossing. Hence, in the presence of strong isoscalar
np correlation the aligned np pair can result in a signiﬁ-
cant structural change between the 3-qp band and the 1-qp
band within the conventional pairing scheme, which will
additionally reduce the interaction strength between them
and consequently induce a sharper alignment in line with
the experimental observations.

Conclusions.

In summary, we have studied the low-
lying yrast states in 87Tc via the 54Fe(36Ar, 2n1p)87Tc
fusion-evaporation reaction at the GANIL accelerator com-
plex. The prompt γγ-neutron and charged-particle coinci-
dences were measured by using the AGATA γ-ray spec-
trometer with the auxiliary NEDA, Neutron Wall, and
DIAMANT arrays, resulting in an extension of the known
87Tc level scheme by 8 units of angular momentum to the
tentative 33/2+
1 state with the ﬁrst band crossing included.
The observed level structure is compared with the neigh-
boring odd-mass N = 44 and 43 isotonic chains as well as
shell-model calculations. A striking feature of decreasing
excitation energy in the higher spin states starting from
25/2+ is observed when approaching the N = Z line. This
observation may be a result of the strong spin-aligned np
pairing interaction which favors a three-quasi-particle-like
conﬁguration as the coupling between an aligned np pair
and an odd particle. Such eﬀects of strong isoscalar pair-
ing correlations are unique to odd-A N ∼ Z nuclei like
87Tc.
