Abstract: The transverse momentum (mass) spectra of the multi-strange and non-multi-strange (i.e. other
identiﬁed) particles in central gold-gold (Au-Au), lead-lead (Pb-Pb), argon-muriate (Ar-KCl) and nickel-nickel (Ni-
Ni) collisions over a wide energy range have been studied in this work. The experimental data measured by various
collaborations have been analyzed. The blast-wave ﬁt with Tsallis statistics is used to extract the kinetic freeze-out
temperature and transverse ﬂow velocity from the experimental data of transverse momentum (mass) spectra. The
extracted parameters increase with the increase of collision energy and appear with the trend of saturation at the
Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). This saturation implies that the
onset energy of phase transition of partial deconﬁnement is 7.7 GeV and that of whole deconﬁnement is 39 GeV.
Furthermore, the energy scan/dependence of kinetic freeze-out scenarios are observed for the multi-strange and
other identiﬁed particles, though the multiple freeze-out scenarios are also observed for various particles.

Keywords: Kinetic freeze-out temperature, transverse ﬂow velocity, onset energy of phase transition, kinetic

freeze-out scenario

Introduction

High energy heavy ion collisions at the Relativis-
tic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the Beam Energy
Scan (BES) program oﬀer a unique possibility to ex-
plore the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase di-
agram [1, 2, 3, 4]. The usual phase diagram of QCD
is plotted as the chemical freeze-out temperature (Tch)
versus baryon chemical potential µB. Let us assume a
thermalized system which is created in heavy ion colli-
sions, Tch and µB are expected to be varied with chang-
ing the collision energy [5, 6, 7]. Theories suggest the
formation of QCD phase diagram which includes a possi-
ble transition from a high density and high temperature

phase known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase and
this phase has been predicted by the lattice QCD [8].

Lattice QCD calculations indicate the evolution of a
rapid cross-over at the hadron to parton phase transi-
tion [9, 10] in the system at µB = 0. Several QCD-based
models [11, 12, 13, 14] and the calculations from lattice
QCD [11] suggest the ﬁrst order phase transition if the
system created in collisions correspond to larger values
of µB. The point in QCD phase diagram plane where
the ﬁrst order phase transition ends, is known as the
QCD critical point [15, 16].

Experimental and theoretical nuclear physics re-
search is currently focused on the digging out of critical

point and the phase boundary in the QCD phase dia-
gram. The RHIC has undertaken the ﬁrst phase of the
BES program [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] upto this end, by vary-
ing the collision energy from the top RHIC to the lower
most possible energy in order to look for the signatures
of QCD phase boundary.

However, before looking to these signatures, it is very
important to know the Tch–µB region of the phase dia-
gram we can access at the chemical freeze-out, as well as
the kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 or Tkin and trans-
verse ﬂow velocity βT at the thermal and kinetic freeze-
out. The transverse momentum (pT ) or mass (mT ) dis-
tributions of the particles and their yields are the tool to
study the thermal and collective properties of the dense
and hot hadronic matter formed in high energy colli-
sions and it allows us to infer the related parameters at
the kinetic and chemical freeze-outs.

In general, the freeze-out itself may be a compli-
cated process, as it involves the duration in time, and
a hierarchy where diﬀerent types of particles and dif-
ferent reactions switch oﬀ at diﬀerent times. According
to the general kinematic arguments, it is expected that
the reactions with the lower collision frequency then
lower total cross-section switches oﬀ at higher densi-
ties/temperatures. However, the one with larger col-
lision frequency and then larger total cross-section lasts
longer. Therefore, the elastic cross-section is larger than
inelastic cross-section in most cases, so the earlier oc-
currence of the inelastic (chemical) freeze-out than the
elastic (kinetic) freeze-out is expected to happen. Gen-
erally, Tch > T0 according to the early study on this
topic in ref. [22].

Furthermore, it is understood that the temperature
is surely one of the most central concepts in thermody-
namics and statistical mechanics. Due to it’s extremely
wide applications on experimental measurements and
theoretical studies, temperature is very important con-
cept in both the thermal and sub-atomic physics. At
least four types of temperatures can be found in litera-
ture of physics of high energy collisions, which includes
the initial temperature, chemical freeze-out tempera-
ture, kinetic freeze-out temperature and eﬀective tem-
perature. These temperatures occur at diﬀerent stages
of the collision process. We have discussed some of these
temperatures in our previous works [23, 24, 25, 26].

Three types of diﬀerent freeze-out scenarios can
be found in literature which includes single [27], dou-
ble [28, 29] and multiple kinetic freeze-out scenar-
ios [30, 31]. In single freeze-out scenario, one set of pa-
rameters should be used for both the spectra of strange

and non-strange particles [27], while one set of parame-
ters for strange (or multi-strange) particles and other for
non-strange (or non-multi-strange) particles should be
used in double kinetic freeze-out scenario [28, 29]. Dif-
ferent sets of parameters for diﬀerent particles with dif-
ferent masses should be used for multiple kinetic freeze-
out scenario [30, 31]. It is needed to ﬁnd out that which
freeze-out scenario is correct.

In this article, we are focusing on the kinetic freeze-
out temperature T0 and transverse ﬂow velocity βT . We
are interested in the onset energy of phase transition and
the kinetic freeze-out scenario which can be obtained
from the analysis of T0 and βT . We shall extract the
two parameters from the transverse momentum (mass)
spectra of diﬀerent particles by using the blast-wave ﬁt
with Tsallis statistics.

The remainder of the paper includes the method and
formalism, results and discussion, as well as summary
and conclusions which are presented in sections 2, 3 and
4, respectively.

2 The method and formalism

We discuss the complex process of high energy colli-
sions in the framework of the blast-wave ﬁt with Tsallis
statistics [27]. Various distributions can be used to de-
scribe the multiple emission sources and the complex
structure of pT spectra, which include but are not lim-
ited to the Erlang distribution [32], the standard distri-
bution (Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein dis-
tributions) [33], the Tsallis distribution [34, 35, 36], the
Tsallis+standard distribution [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], the
Schwinger mechanism [43, 44], the blast-wave ﬁt with
boltzmann statistics [45, 46, 47, 48] and so forth. These
can be the choices in the soft excitation process. Al-
though the probability density function can be of vari-
ous forms, it is not enough to describe the pT spectra,
particularly the maximum pT up to 100 GeV/c in colli-
sions at LHC [49].

In fact, several pT regions, including the ﬁrst re-
gion with pT < 4–6 GeV/c, the second region with 4–6
GeV/c < pT < 17–20 GeV/c and the third region with
pT > 17–20 GeV/c have been observed in ref. [50]. Dif-
ferent pT regions are expected to correspond to diﬀer-
ent mechanisms. According to ref. [50], diﬀerent whole
features of fragmentation and hadronization of partons
through the string dynamics can be reﬂected by diﬀer-
ent pT regions. The eﬀect and changes by the medium
in the ﬁrst pT region take part in the main role, while

2

in second pT region, it appears weakly. The third pT
region reﬂects the negligible inﬂuence of the medium on
the nuclear transparency. Maximum number of strings
are expected to have in the second pT region from ev-
ery point of view and it results in fusion and creation of
strings and the partons collective behavior.

We would like to point out that we mention about
diﬀerent pT regions corresponding to diﬀerent mecha-
nisms. This may be translated into having diﬀerent ﬁt-
ting functions with diﬀerent parameters when one ﬁts
the spectra in these regions. However, on the other
hand, there are universality, similarity or common char-
acteristic in high energy collisions [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,
57, 58]. This means that one may also use the same func-
tion to ﬁt the spectra in wide pT range with the same
ﬁtting parameters. In fact, in ref. [59], the Tsallis-like
distribution is able to ﬁt the ATLAS and CMS spectra
over 14 orders of magnitude with the same value of the
parameters. Indeed, there are both the particular and
common characteristics in high energy collisions.

Although various distributions may be used for de-
scribing the particle spectra, the Tsallis distribution and
its alternative forms can ﬁt the wider spectra. In par-
ticular, the Tsallis distribution can cover the two- or
three-component standard distribution [60]. This means
that, to ﬁt the spectra as widely as possible, one may
use the Tsallis distribution and its alternative forms. In
addition, the blast-wave ﬁt can be easily used to extract
synchronously the kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 and
transverse ﬂow velocity βT . Thus, it is convenient for
us to use the combination of the Tsallis distribution and
the blast-wave ﬁt to extract T0 and βT from enough wide
spectra. This combination is in fact the the blast-wave
ﬁt with Tsallis statistics [27, 61].

According to [27], the probability density function
of pT at mid-rapidity in the blast-wave ﬁt with Tsallis
statistics can be given by

1) [62] used in
Eq. (1) is a replacement of 1/(q
1) used in refs. [27, 61]
due to the fact that q is also required for the thermo-
dynamic consistency [36, 62]. Because of q being close
to 1, this replacement causes a very small diﬀerence in
the values of q in the two cases. In addition, Eq. (1) is
valid only at around mid-rapidity due to the fact that
we have used mT cosh y
mT to simply the equation
from the integral of y. This simpliﬁcation aﬀects the
normalization constant C, but there is no obvious in-
ﬂuence on T0 and βT due to narrow mid-rapidity range
being used. If the rapidity range is not around y = 0,
we may transform it to around y = 0 to subtract the
inﬂuence of longitudinal motion of emission source. As
the normalization constant for the probability density
function Eq. (1), C does not aﬀect the free parameters.
In this paper, we use the blast-wave ﬁt with Tsallis
statistics to describe the soft excitation process. But in
some cases the ﬁt in high pT region is not well, then we
can use the two-component ﬁt in which the second com-
ponent describes the hard scattering process. The Hage-
dorn function [63, 64] or inverse power law [65, 66, 67]
can be used for the second component, that is

(2)

where A is the normalization constant which results in
the integral of Eq. (2) to be normalized to 1, and p0
and n are the free parameters.

For the harder part of the spectra, we suggest to use
the Hagedorn function given by Eq. (2) which is similar
to the Tsallis-like function without the blast-wave cor-
rections [36, 62]. In fact, there is a relation n = q/(q
1)
between the two functions. It is acceptable if we use the
Tsallis-like function instead of the Hagedorn function in
the case of the two temperatures (two entropy indexes)
being distinguished for with and without the blast-wave
corrections. The blast-wave corrections are not needed
for the harder part of the spectra due to its earlier pro-
duction than the softer part, when the blast-wave is not
formed.

To describe the spectra in a wide pT range, we have

two methods to superpose Eqs. (1) and (2). That is

k) denotes the contribution fraction of
where k (1
the soft excitation (hard scattering) process in the ﬁrst
method. Naturally, the integral of Eq. (3) is normalized
to 1. Meanwhile, in the second method [63], A1 and A2
are the normalization constants which result in the two
components to be equal to each other at pT = p1. The
function θ(x) = 0 if x < 0 and θ(x) = 1 if x
0. The
integral of Eq. (4) is normalized to 1, too. The con-
k) of the soft excitation (hard
tribution fraction k (1
scattering) process in the second method is the integral
of the ﬁrst (second) component in Eq. (4).

−

≥

To use Eq. (4) and to decide the value of p1, we may
ﬁt the low- and high-pT regions by the ﬁrst and second
components respectively [25]. It is general that the ﬁrst
component cannot ﬁt the high-pT region and the second
component cannot ﬁt the low-pT region. There is a cross
connection between the two components. The value of
pT at the cross connection is naturally regarded as the
value of p1. Because of the cross connection is restricted
by the two components, p1 is not a free parameter. Gen-
erally, the curve at pT = p1 is possibly not too smooth.
If the spectra are not in a very wide pT range, the
second component in Eqs. (3) and (4) are not neces-
sary in the ﬁtting procedure. Thus, we can use only the
ﬁrst component in Eqs. (3) and (4), that is Eq. (1),
to ﬁt the spectra. Although Eqs. (2)–(4) are not used
in the ﬁtting procedure in this work, we present them
to show a whole treatment in methodology. In the case
of analyzing the spectra in wide pT range, we may use
together Eqs. (1) and (2) due to Eq. (3) or (4).

In some cases, the spectra are in the form of
mT , but not pT . Then, we need to convert the pT
distribution fS(pT ) to the mT distribution fS′(mT )
by fS′ (mT )

due to the invariant cross-section. In fact, Eq.

We convert it to the form of fS(pT ) expediently. To
extract T0 and βT , we do not need the spectra in a wide
pT range due to small fraction in high pT region.

The symbols in panels (a)–(c) represent the experi-

E802 [71, 72], STAR [73, 74, 75], PHENIX [76, 77]
and ALICE collaborations [78]. In panel (d) the sym-
bols represent the experimental data measured by
the HADES [79, 80], STAR [81, 82, 83] and CMS
Collaborations [84]. The symbols in panels (e), (f),
(g) and (h) represent the experimental data quoted
from refs.
[81, 88, 89]
and [76, 77, 84, 85], respectively. The curves are our
ﬁtted results by using Eq.
(1). The values of the
free parameters (T0, βT and q), the normalization con-
stant (N0), χ2, and the number of degree of freedom
(ndof) are given in Table 1 and its continued part with
together the concrete collisions, energies, centrality,
(pseudo)rapidity, particles, spectra and scaled factors
in the ﬁgure. Due to the resonance production, the
spectra in very low-pT region are not taken care care-
fully in the ﬁt process, while the ﬁt itself is not too
good. One can see that the blast-wave ﬁt with Tsallis
statistics ﬁts approximately the experimental data over
a wide energy range.

[81, 85, 86],

It should be noted that the normalization constant
N0 is used to compare the ﬁt function fS(pT ) (or
fS′(mT )) and the experimental spectra, and the nor-
malization constant C is used to let the integral of
Eq.
(1) be 1. The two normalization constants are
diﬀerent, though C can be absorbed in N0. We have
used both the C and N0 to give a clear description.
In the comparisons, we have (1/2πpT )N0fS(pT )/dy =
(1/2πpT )d2N/dpT dy, N0fS(pT )/dy = d2N/dpT dy,
(1/2πmT )N0fS′ (mT )/dy = (1/2πmT )d2N/dmT dy, or
T )d2N/dmT dy, due to
(1/m2
diﬀerent forms of the spectra. In particular, the value of
N0 for K 0
S production in Ar-KCl collisions at 2.25 GeV
is very small due to less participant nucleons at lower
collision energy performed in ref. [79].

Fig. 1. The pT or mT
−
of other identiﬁed particles (π+, K +, p and K 0
S), produced at mid-y in central Au-Au, Pb-Pb and Ar-KCl collisions at
diﬀerent √sNN . The particle types and collision energies are marked in the panels. The symbols in panels (a)–(c) represent
the experimental data measured by the E866 [68], E895 [69, 70], E802 [71, 72], STAR [73, 74, 75], PHENIX [76, 77] and
ALICE collaborations [78]. In panel (d) the symbols represent the experimental data measured by the HADES [79, 80],
STAR [81, 82, 83] and CMS Collaborations [84]. The curves are our ﬁtted results by using Eq. (1). More information in
detail can be found in Table 1.

In addition, although R can be regarded as the trans-
verse radius of the participant region, it has no absolute
meaning due to the fact that it appears in terms of r/R.
Although the ﬁt result is not related to R, R cannot be
absorbed in C or N0 due to a concrete R being needed
to perform the calculation process. As the simple nor-
malization constant in probability density function and
the irrelevant upper limit in integral process, the values
of C and R are not listed in Table 1 to avoid trivial
presentation.

Before continuing this work, we would like to point
out that Fig. 1 is only a part collection of transverse
spectra.
In fact, more experimental data were pub-
lished in the community. For example, the NA49 exper-
iment was performed for carbon-carbon (C-C), silicon-

silicon (Si-Si) and Pb-Pb collisions in which the exten-
sive experimental studies of the possible phase transi-
tion were carried in the range of √sN N = 6.3–17.3
GeV [90, 91, 92, 93]. The NA61/SHINE experiment was
performed at similar energies for gathering rich data on
nuclear collisions in a two-dimensional scan, i.e. varying
collision energy and nuclear size [92, 93, 94, 95]. Indeed,
these experiments have provided more abundant data.

To study the dependence of kinetic freeze-out tem-
perature T0 and transverse ﬂow velocity βT on collision
energy √sN N , the excitation functions of T0 and βT for
central Au-Au collisions are shown in Figs. 2(a) and
2(b) respectively. The results for π+, K +, p, K 0
S, φ,
Λ, ¯Ξ+ (Ξ+, Ξ) and ¯Ω+ (Ω− + Ω+, Ω) are represented
by diﬀerent symbols marked in the panels. One can

see that T0 in Fig. 2(a) and βT in Fig. 2(b) increase
quickly at lower energies from 2.7 to 7.7 GeV due to the
fact that the system got higher excitation degree and
stronger squeeze and expansion degree. They remain
constant from 7.7 to 39 GeV and then increase up to
higher energies. The variation of T0 and βT at diﬀerent
collision energies is displayed in Fig. 2(c). A larger T0
can be clearly seen at larger βT due to higher collision
energy, which shows positive correlation between T0 and
βT .

We notice that there is a saturation in the excita-
tion functions of T0 and βT in the BES energy range at
the RHIC, which means that the interaction mechanism
or evolution process in √sN N = 7.7–39 GeV is diﬀer-
ent from that in √sN N < 7.7 GeV and in √sN N > 39
GeV. In our opinion, the system is baryon-dominated
in √sN N < 7.7 GeV, in which there is no phase tran-

sition from hadron matter to QGP due to small en-
ergy deposition. The system is meson-dominated in
√sN N > 39 GeV, in which the phase transition had
happened in whole volume due to large energy deposi-
tion. The system starts its phase transition in part vol-
ume at √sN N = 7.7 GeV and undergoes from baryon-
dominated to meson-dominated due to phase transition
in larger and larger volume in √sN N = 7.7–39 GeV. The
onset energy of part phase transition is 7.7 GeV and that
of whole phase transition is 39 GeV. The critical energy
range is from 7.7 GeV to 39 GeV.

It is known that the chemical freeze-out temperature
Tch and baryon chemical potential µB from the thermal
and statistical model [96, 97], can be parameterized as

where Tlim = 0.1584 GeV, a = 1.3075 GeV, and √sN N
is in the units of GeV [98]. We have the critical range
of Tch = 0.138–0.158 GeV and µB = 0.406–0.107 GeV
while √sN N = 7.7–39 GeV. These values show the
ranges of Tch and µB in the critical energy range.

We noticed that it is indeed possible to observe that
while going from low to high temperature, a hadron gas
becomes more and more meson dominated. As men-
tioned in ref. [99], with the help of the thermal model
calculations, it is possible to plot the normalized en-
tropy density for mesons and baryons, and then one
may observe that the dominance changes at a cross-
0.140 GeV corresponding to
over temperature of Tch ≈
0.406 GeV and √s
µB ≈
9.3 GeV which are almost
≈
exactly the values for Tch and µB the present work gets.

It is noteworthy that the kinetic freeze-out temper-
ature for the emission of multi-strange particles is ob-
served considerably higher than those for the emissions
of other identiﬁed particles, which reveals a picture of
separate freeze-out processes for other identiﬁed and
multi-strange particles. Meanwhile, the transverse ﬂow
velocity of multi-strange particles is lower than that of
other identiﬁed particles. The reason behind the high
kinetic freeze-out temperature (low transverse ﬂow ve-
locity) may be that the multi-strange hadrons can be left
behind in the system evolution process due to their large
mass. This possibility is a reﬂection of hydrodynamic
behavior [100], in which massive particles are leaved due
to their small velocity.

With the increase of collision energy, both the ki-
netic freeze-out temperature T0 and transverse ﬂow ve-
locity βT increase or keep invariant if phase transition
had happened in part volume. There is a positive cor-
relation between T0 and βT when we study them over a

9

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wide energy range. This renders that the system stays
at high excitation state and undergoes large squeeze and
expansion due to large energy deposition at high energy.
This work does not support the negative correlation be-
tween T0 and βT when we increase the energy, though
negative correlation can be explained as long lifetime
(then low excitation) and large squeeze and expansion.
Deservedly, for a given spectrum, T0 and βT is negative
correlation, which is not the case for varying energy.

The values of q extracted from the spectra of π+,
S, φ, Λ, ¯Ξ+ (Ξ+, Ξ) and ¯Ω+ (Ω− + Ω+,
K +, p, K 0
Ω) in central AA collisions at diﬀerent energies do not
show particular behavior, but hardly energy dependent
or slightly change with energy. As an entropy index,
q characterizes the degree of equilibrium of the system.
Generally, an equilibrium state corresponds to q to be 1.
The values of q obtained in this work are approximately
close to 1, which renders that the system in the consid-
ered energy range stays approximately in an equilibrium
state or in a few local equilibrium states. This also ren-
ders that the blast-wave ﬁt is approximately useable in
this work.

However, it should be noted that the entropy index
q is a very very sensitive quantity. A large q which is
not close to 1 results in a wide distribution, and a small
q which is close to 1 results in a narrow distribution.
It is the fact that q = 1.01 is not close enough to 1.
So, it does not imply that the Tsallis blast-wave ﬁt is
close to its Boltzmann-Gibbs counterpart if we use the
same T0 and βT in the case of q = 1.01. To reduce
the diﬀerence between the Tsallis blast-wave ﬁt and its
Boltzmann-Gibbs counterpart, we need q = 1.0001 or
the one which is closer to 1.

4 Summary and conclusions

The main observations and conclusions are summa-

rized here.

(a) The transverse momentum (mass) spectra of π+,
S, φ, Λ, ¯Ξ+ (Ξ+, Ξ) and ¯Ω+ (Ω− + Ω+, Ω)
K +, p, K 0
produced in central AA collisions at mid-y or mid-η over
an energy range from 2.7 GeV to 2.76 TeV have been
studied by the blast-wave ﬁt with Tsallis statistics. The
kinetic freeze-out temperature T0 and transverse ﬂow
velocity βT are extracted from the ﬁt to transverse mo-
mentum (mass) spectra.

lision energy from 2.7 to 7.7 GeV. Then they remains
invariant from 7.7 to 39 GeV. At above 39 GeV, they
show the trend of increase. The three energy ranges
have identiﬁable boundaries and render three diﬀerent
interaction mechanisms or evolution processes.

(c) The system is baryon-dominated from 2.7 to 7.7
GeV, in which there is no phase transition from hadron
matter to QGP due to low energy deposition. The sys-
tem starts its phase transition in part volume at 7.7
GeV and undergoes from baryon-dominated to meson-
dominated due to phase transition in larger and larger
volume in 7.7–39 GeV. The system is meson-dominated
at above 39 GeV, in which the phase transition had hap-
pened in whole volume.

(d) The onset energy of part phase transition from
hadron matter to QGP is 7.7 GeV and that of whole
phase transition is 39 GeV. The multi-strange and other
identiﬁed particles shows separate freeze-out process due
to the diﬀerence in temperature and ﬂow velocity. From
the reﬁned structure, the multiple freeze-out scenarios
are also observed due to the mass dependent tempera-
ture and ﬂow velocity.
