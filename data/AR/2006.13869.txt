Abstract  

Core accretion is the conventional model for the formation of the gas giant planets. The model may also apply 
to the icy giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, except that it may take upward of 50 Myr for them to form at 
their present orbital distances, which is beyond the maximum 5 Myr lifetime of the solar nebula. A plausible 
alternative is formation in the region of the gas giants, followed by migration to their present locations at 20 
and 30 AU. Another alternative is the gravitational instability model, which is much faster and does not require 
the  formation  of  a  core  first.  In  either  scenario,  heavy  elements  (mass  >  helium)  provide  the  critical 
observational  constraints.  Additionally,  helium  and  neon  abundances  in  the  observable  troposphere  are 
indicators  of  the  interior  processes  in  the  megabar  region.  We  investigate  the  atmospheric  regions  most 
suitable  for  accessing  the  above  elements.  Volatiles  containing  some  of  the  elements  (C,  N,  S,  O)  undergo 
condensation  on  the  icy  giants.  On  the  other  hand,  noble  gases  (He,  Ne,  Ar,  Kr,  Xe),  which  are  chemically 
inert, non-condensible, and uniform all over the planet, can provide the best constraints to the formation and 
migration models of Uranus and Neptune. Only entry probes are capable of measuring the key elements and 
isotopic ratios. They are accessible at 5-10 bars, except for the condensibles. Data from an orbiter on gravity, 
magnetic  field,  upper  atmospheric  composition  and  the  maps  of  ammonia  and  water  with  depth  would  be  a 
valuable complement to in situ measurements.

1 Introduction 

The giant planets are key to understanding how the solar system formed, and, by extension, how other solar 
systems around sun-like stars form. Due to their large mass and substantial magnetic fields, loss of volatiles, 
even the lightest element, hydrogen, from the giant planets is insignificant since the time of their formation 4.6 
billion  years  ago.  Thus,  the  giant  planets  are  arguably  the  ideal  objects  to  reveal  the  conditions  of  the 
primordial  solar  nebula  from  which  all  solar  system  bodies  formed.  Whereas  Jupiter  and  Saturn  are  largely 
gaseous,  with  solid  material  comprising  only  about  3-5%  of  their  planetary  mass,  Uranus  and  Neptune  are 
made up of mostly icy/rocky material, which could be up to 90% of their mass. Thus, the icy giant planets are 
in  a  class  of  their  own,  distinct  from  the  gas  giant  planets,  yet  very  much  a  part  of  the  giant  planet  family. 
While multiple spacecraft have explored Jupiter and Saturn extensively since the early 1970’s, much of what 
we know about the properties of the icy giant planets is the result of brief flybys of Uranus and Neptune by the 
Voyager 2 spacecraft, respectively in 1986 and 1989, and observations from 1 AU. However, the data to date 
on  their  atmospheric  composition,  structure,  dynamics,  magnetic  fields,  interiors,  rings  and  satellites,  etc.  is 
still quite limited in scope. A comprehensive study of the icy giant planets is thus essential to understand their 
formation and migration scenarios as well as their role in the formation of the outer solar system. Uranus and 
Neptune  also  serve  as  the  only  solar  system  analogs  for  the  most  common  type  of  nearly  4000  confirmed 
exoplanets to date, about 40% of which are mini-Neptune to Neptune size objects (Figure 1). The focus of this 
paper is mainly on the formation and the compositional data necessary to constrain them. We will first discuss 
briefly  the  conventional  formation  models,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  key  sets  of  data  and  an  outline  of 
possible scenarios for a mission to the icy giant planets.

2 Formation Scenarios 

The  presence  of  Uranus  and  Neptune  in  our  solar  system  raises  the  question  of  their  formation  in  the 
framework  of  the  standard  theories  of  planetary  formation.  Both  current  formation  models,  namely  the  core 
accretion and the gravitational instability models, have been used to explain the formation and properties of the 
two  planets.  Formation  by  core  accretion  is  a  slow  and  steady  process,  whereas  formation  by  gravitational 
stability is relatively fast.   

In  the  core  accretion  model,  the  formation  of  a  giant  planet  starts  with  non  gravitational  collisions  between 
micron size dust grains (of metals, ices, possibly refractories, and trapped volatiles) resulting in relatively large 
planetesimals, followed by core growth, concurrent accretion of solids and gas onto the core, and finally by the 
rapid  accretion  of  a  massive  gaseous  envelope  once  the  core  reached  a  critical  mass  of  10-15  Earth  Masses, 
ME, (Mizuno 1980; Pollack et al. 1996; Hubickyj et al. 2005). In this scenario, had Uranus and Neptune formed 
at their current orbits of 20 and 30 AU, they would require formation timescales on the order of 50 Myr due to 
lower  disk  density  at  those  distances  (Pollack  et  al.  1996),  i.e.  on  a  time  scale  that  far  exceeds  the  1-5  Myr 
lifetime  of  the  protosolar  nebula  (PSN).  Planetary  migration,  which  is  commonplace  in  exoplanets,  has 
therefore  been  invoked  during  the  growth  of  the  two  icy  giants  planets  in  the  neighborhood  of  Jupiter  and 
Saturn (Trilling et al. 1998; Edgar 2007; Alexander and Armitage 2009; Helled and Bodenheimer 2014). On 
the  other  hand,  recent  formation  models  suggesting  the  accretion  of  the  icy  giants  from  pebbles  may  also 
overcome  the  timescale  problem  (Lambrechts  and  Johansen  2012;  Johansen  and  Lambrechts  2017).  In  all 
scenarios, the metallicity of the icy giants strongly depends on the composition of the accreted planetesimals or 
pebbles.  The  high  elemental  abundances  observed  in  the  envelopes  would  result  either  from  the 
devolatilization  of  the  accreted  solids  or  from  the  dilution  of  the  cores,  or  both.  In  contrast  with  the  core 
accretion  model,  giant  planets  form  rather  rapidly  in  tens  of  thousand  years  directly  from  gas  as  a  result  of 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
gravitational  instabilities  in  a  disk  (Boss,  1997;  Mayer  et  al.,  2002).  In  this  case,  the  growth  of  disk 
perturbations  leads  to  density  enhancements  or  clumps  in  disk  regions,  where  self-gravity  becomes  as 
important as, or exceeds the stabilizing effects of pressure and shear. It has been proposed that icy giants could 
consist of remnants of gas giants that formed from disk instability, and whose cores would have formed from 
the  settling  of  dust  grains  in  the  envelopes  prior  to  their  photoevaporation  by  a  nearby  OB  star  (Boss  et  al., 
2002).  Planets  formed  in  this  manner  could  also  present  envelopes  with  enhanced  metallicities  compared  to 
that of their host star, considering the possibility of later addition of material. Though gravitational instability 
model might seem to be consistent with global properties of Uranus and Neptune’s, it has at least two major 
shortcomings: (a) it requires a stochastic event to occur, and (b) the presence of natural and captured satellites 
around  these  planets  suggest  that  planetesimal  and/or  pebbles  were  already  present  during  planet  formation, 
thus reinforcing the idea of the core accretion scenario. Also, if one assumes that the four giant planets formed 
into a compact system, then Jupiter and Saturn would also have suffered from photoevaporation, which is not 
the  case,  given  their  much  lower  enrichments  in  volatiles,  compared  to  Uranus  and  Neptune  (provided  that 
their C/H enrichment is proxy for the other heavy elements).  

The core accretion model is further strengthened by several observations, including heavy element enrichment 
at  Jupiter,  and  where  available,  the  other  giant  planets,  first  solids  (millimeter  size  chondrules  and  calcium 
aluminum  inclusions)  at  the  very  beginning  of  the  solar  system,  and  greater  frequency  of  exoplanets  around 
higher metallicity stars (see Atreya et al. 2019a and references therein for additional details). 

Formation of a massive core is central to the core accretion model. The core is made from “heavy elements” 
(>4He), which were presumably released to the envelope during accretionary heating phase, thus forming the 
atmosphere, together with the most volatile of gases, hydrogen, helium and neon, which were gravitationally 
captured  from  the  surrounding  protoplanetary  nebula  when  the  core  reached  a  critical  mass.  The  heavy 
elements  are  thus  key  constraints  to  the  formation  models.  Though  much  is  known  about  Jupiter’s  heavy 
elements, little information presently exists for the icy giant planets, since it requires in situ measurements of 
bulk  composition,  which  are  presently  lacking  for  the  icy  giants.  In  the  following  section  we  discuss  the 
presently  known  information  and  expectations  for  their  elemental  and  isotopic  abundances,  followed  by 
required measurements. 

3 Bulk Composition, and Vertical Variation 

Constituents in the upper atmosphere and the ionosphere are subject to meteorological, dynamical, circulation 
and  chemical  processes,  which  govern  their  distribution.  The  region  of  the  atmosphere  below  which  the 
relative  proportion  of  a  given  species  remains  constant  is  where  the  species  elemental  abundance  can  be 
determined.  In  the  atmosphere  of  the  icy  giants,  very  few  molecules  have  been  detected  so  far,  and  a  vast 
majority of them in their stratospheres. Figure 2 illustrates this point for Neptune, but is nearly equally valid 
for  Uranus.  Remote  sensing  in  the  UV  allowed  the  determination  of  certain  hydrocarbons  in  the  upper 
atmosphere (Broadfoot et al. 1986, 1989). IR detected certain hydrocarbons in the stratosphere and H3+ higher 
(Fletcher et al. 2010; Meadows et al. 2008, Orton et al. 2014, Trafton et al. 1993, Stallard et al. 2014). Radio 
occultations  from  spacecraft  made  measurements  of  the  electron  concentration  higher  up  (inset;  Tyler  et  al. 
1986, 1989) and of temperature in the lower stratosphere (Lindal et al. 1992, 1987), whereas the ground-based 
VLA data in the microwave are able to sense deeper in the troposphere (Gulkis et al. 1978). This illustration 
also  shows  possible  existence  of  several  cloud  layers  of  multiple  species  at  different  depths  and  a  water 
cloud/ocean at 10’s – 100’s of kilobars. Thus the well-mixed atmosphere for measuring the bulk composition, 
hence  the  elemental  abundances,  is  most  likely  quite  deep  for  the  condensible  species.  In  the  following 
subsections, we first discuss the condensible species, followed by the noble gases.

Figure  2.  Illustration  of  the  regions  of  Neptune’s  atmosphere  that  can  be  explored  using  different  parts  of  the  solar 
spectrum  and  the  type  of  information  obtained.  For  example,  UV  is  useful  down  to  ~10  microbar,  whereas  radio 
occultations are good for the ionosphere (inset) and again in the troposphere between ~1-1000 millibar. Only the topmost 
cloud layer has been inferred from the radio occultation observations done on Voyager. The composition of this cloud and 
others shown in the figure are based on thermochemical models. Maarten Roos-Serote helped with an earlier version of the 
graphic. [Fig. 1 in Atreya et al., Acta Astronautica, 162, 266, 2019b]	

3.1 Condensibles: Methane, Ammonia, Hydrogen Sulfide, and the Elemental Abundances of C, N And S  

Current elemental abundances of all four giant planets are shown in Figure 3 (Atreya et al. 2019a). The actual 
values  together  with  their  ratios  to  protosolar  abundances  are  given  in  Table  1.  The  bulk  of  a  giant  planet’s 
carbon is sequestered in methane (CH4). In Uranus and Neptune, the only elemental abundance determined to 
date is that of C from ground-based observations of CH4. The C/H ratio is found to be 80±20× solar in both icy 
giants,  although  Figure  4  shows  that  deriving  the  C/H  elemental  ratio  from  atmospheric  CH4 mixing  ratio 
retrievals  involves  assumptions  about  the  amount  of  H  tied  up  in  volatiles  such  as  H2O  and  NH3.  Remote-
sensing  retrievals  of  CH4  atmospheric  mixing  ratios  are  complicated  by  latitudinal  gradients  presumably 
established by meridional circulation (e.g., Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011, Tollefson et al. 2019, Sromovsky 
et al. 2019), and it is unknown whether the level of well-mixed CH4 may be displaced downward by multiple 
scale  heights  due  to  dynamical  effects,  as  Juno  found  for  ammonia  at  Jupiter  (Bolton  et  al.  2017;  Li  et  al. 
2017).

Figure 3. Elemental abundance ratios in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune relative to the protosolar 
values. “N” in Jupiter represents values from ammonia (NH3) abundance measurements made by the Galileo probe mass 
spectrometer  [J(M)]  and  the  attenuation  of  probe  radio  signal  [J(R)]  as  well  as  the  Juno  microwave  spectrometer 
[J(MWR)]. The Jovian “Ar" value from the Galileo Probe measurements is shown as ratio to the protosolar Ar/H value of 
Asplund et al. [J(A)] and Lodders et al. [J(L)] since the solar argon values of the two sets of authors differ considerably. 
Saturn’s He and N are labeled S. N/H	of	Saturn	is	a	lower	limit,	and	S/H	is	highly	questionable. Only C/H is determined 
for Uranus and Neptune from ground-based CH4 to ~1bar,level, but could be greater in the deep atmosphere (see Atreya et 
al. (2019a) and references therein for other details). [This version of the figure was adapted from Fig. 2.1 of Atreya et al. 
(2019a), with permission from Cambridge University Press, PLSclear Ref No: 18694]. 	

For  all  practical  purposes,  ammonia  (NH3)  is  the  bulk  reservoir  of  nitrogen  in  all  giant  planets.  The  earliest 
radio observations of Uranus showed that, unlike Jupiter and Saturn, its atmospheric composition was far from 
solar  (Gulkis  et  al.  1978).  Subsequent  observations  a  decade  later  confirmed  that  and  found  even  larger 
depletion factors in some places on Uranus and Neptune (de Pater et al. 1989, 1991). Gulkis et al. (1978) found 
in particular that NH3, the dominant opacity source at Jupiter and Saturn, must be depleted relative to its solar 
abundance by a factor of 100 at temperatures below ~250 K (pressures < 40 bars).  This was the best way to 
explain the very bright radio emissions seen at wavelengths from ~1 to 6 cm, as NH3 is a powerful microwave 
absorber  and  even  modest  amounts  of  it  would  shield  the  hotter  regions  of  the  atmosphere  from  view.  Even 
lower  values  were  reported  in  later  publications.  The  observed  depletion  of  NH3  abundance  at  these 
temperatures is surprising because the bulk of the planet is expected to be enriched in NH3 relative to solar, 
and  contrary  to  the  predictions  of  equilibrium  cloud  condensation  models,  an  example  of  which  is  shown  in 
Figure 5. This figure is based on temperatures measured on Voyager using the radio occultation technique at 
Uranus (Lindal et al. 1987) and their CH4 mole fraction of ~45× solar (the current CH4 values are higher, Table 
1). The elemental ratios of N, S and O are arbitrarily taken as 1× solar, only for illustration purposes. The NH3 
cloud in this case forms at ~10 bars. A CH4 cloud also forms in 1-1.4 bar range (Figure 5), consistent with the 
Voyager finding of a cloud layer in this region. [Other cloud layers in Figure 5 are an NH4SH ice and the ice 
and  droplet  clouds  of  H2O  that  result  from  assumed  atmospheric  composition.]  Below  its  cloud  level,  NH3 
vapor is expected to be well-mixed, i.e. 1× solar in this model, not depleted by factors of 100 or so measured 
by the VLA data. As the temperature of Neptune at 1 bar is within only a few degrees of  Uranus and the lapse 
rates are expected to be similar, the result is nearly the same as for both planets. In Jupiter also, depletion of 
ammonia  to  several  tens  of  bars  below  its  0.7  bar  condensation  level  has  been  measured  by  the  Juno 
microwave radiometer, but the depletion factor is only about 2 (Bolton et al. 2017, Li et al. 2017).

The VLA data indicated that higher opacity was required in the shallow troposphere than that due to observed 
amounts  of  ammonia.  Improved  measurements  from  the  ground  at  wavelengths  from  the  far  infrared  to  the 
radio (Orton et al. 2014), and improved ab initio calculations of collision-broadened H2 (Orton et al. 2007) also 
support the idea of more opacity near the ~1 bar region and that a species more volatile than NH3 was needed 
to provide it. That species was predicted to be H2S gas with an H2S ice cloud in the ~3 bar region (de Pater et 
al.  1989,  1991).  Presence  of  H2S  at  these  altitudes  may  plausibly  be  attributed  to  an  unexpectedly  large 
depletion in NH3 (Atreya and Wong 2005, Atreya et al. 2019b). This is because NH3 normally serves as a sink 
for  H2S  mole  for  mole,  culminating  in  the  formation  of  a  thermochemical  cloud  of  ammonium  hydrosulfide 
(NH4SH) or ammonium sulfide ((NH4)2S) ice at appropriate temperatures in a solar composition atmosphere 
(Lewis and Prinn 1970). With NH3 severely depleted in the icy giants, H2S vapor could survive to the upper 
troposphere, but that requires the S/N ratio to be ≥5× solar (de Pater et al.. 1989, 1991; Irwin et al 2018). The 
H2S vapor would condense into an H2S ice cloud at a pressure level that depends on the assumed enhancement 
of the  S/N ratio above solar, as seen in Figure 6. Indeed, with S/N ratio of about 5× solar, an H2S ice cloud 
forms in the 2-3 bar region. This calculation is for illustration purposes only to show the likelihood of an H2S 
cloud,  whose  location  can  be  fine-tuned  by  adjusting  any  number  of  parameters  including  the  atmospheric 
temperature structure, degree of NH3 depletion in the relevant region, distribution of absorbers, etc. Presence 
of H2S vapor and cloud in approximately 1-3 bar region on both Uranus and Neptune has now been confirmed 
from  ground-based  observations  in  the  infrared  (Irwin  et  al.  2018,  2019,  and  Table  1).  The  methane  cloud 
above it forms the topmost cloud layer on Uranus and Neptune.

Figure  4.  The  C/H  elemental  ratio  (y-axis)  is  non-linearly  related  to  measured  CH4  hydrogen  mixing  ratios  (x-axis), 
especially in compositions with high heavy-element abundances. The difference between solid and dashed lines accounts 
for the amount of hydrogen tied up in the volatile species CH4, H2O, and NH3 throughout the planetary envelope. In the 
C/O and C/N solar case (solid black line), the 87x solar CH4 mixing ratio for Neptune (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011) 
actually  corresponds  to  a  72x  solar  C/H  ratio  (a  22%  difference).  In  the  500x  solar  O/H  case  (Sec.  4.3.1),  so  much 
hydrogen is tied up in H2O molecules that the observed CH4 mixing ratio would imply only a 36x solar bulk C/H ratio in 
the envelope.

Figure 5. A solar-composition cloud structure model, constrained by the p-T and the CH4 mole fraction (C/H = 45× solar) 
from Voyager [Lindal et al. 1987], would have an NH3-ice cloud layer but no H2S-ice cloud. The results for Neptune are 
very similar, considering their temperatures are within a few degrees of each other at the 1 bar level. Cloud densities are 
calculated using the formula from Weidenschilling and Lewis (1973), which Wong et al. (2015) showed corresponds to a 
very  large  updraft  length  scale,  equal  to  the  pressure  scale  height  H(z)  at  each  altitude.  Actual  cloud  densities  in  most 
Uranus/Neptune situations are likely to be much smaller than shown, but the pressure-levels of cloud bases are unaffected 
by the choice of updraft length scale.

Figure 6. As opposed to the solar-composition case of Fig. 4, compositions with supersolar S/N ratios (in this part of the 
upper troposphere) result in H2S ice condensation instead. Models consider NH3 of 0.001 to 5 × solar and S/N enhanced by 
factors of 6 and 16 above solar . CH4 ice continues to remain as the topmost cloud layer, with H2S ice below at ~3 bar level 
for S/N=6. See Fig. 5 caption for discussion of cloud densities and cloud base pressure levels. 

Although NH3 is found to be depleted in the tropospheres of Uranus and Neptune, it was clear from the longer-
wavelength  radio  data  that  the  depletion  of  absorber  (whether  NH3  or  not)  does  not  persist  throughout  the 
troposphere,  as  it  rapidly  becomes  more  opaque  at  higher  temperatures  and  pressures  (de  Pater  et  al.  1989). 
The increase in opacity may be associated with a combination of water vapor and water drops (perhaps with 
NH3 in solution), though an additional absorber (such as increased NH3 vapor or H2S) would improve the fit. 
The  exact  abundances  and  even  the  identification  of  some  species  is  subject  to  many  assumptions,  but  it 
appears  that  on  Uranus  H2S  is  modestly  enriched  relative  to  solar  near  50  bars,  while  NH3  is  much  more 
significantly depleted relative to solar. The S/N ratio in this region is >1, with near solar H2S in the ~5 to 30 
bar region.  On Neptune, the trends are the same, though H2S is more strongly enriched both above and below 
the NH4SH cloud. Figure 7 shows a representative VLA observations (Hofstadter et al. 2018). As can be seen, 
a  solar  composition  atmosphere  does  not  fit  the  data,  but  requires  high  depletion  of  NH3  in  the  upper 
troposphere and H2S possibly being the main absorber down to ~50 bars. It should be stressed that the NH3 and 
H2S  abundances  even  at  50  bars  may  not  be  representative  of  their  bulk  abundances  in  the  deep  well-mixed 
atmosphere, hence not valid for deriving the true N and S elemental abundances in Uranus and Neptune (Sec. 
3.2).

3.2 Water: Ionic Ocean and Water Ocean as Potential Sinks of NH3, H2S and H2O 

The observed depletion of ammonia to tens of bar levels in the icy giant planets is surprising. Predictions based 
on nearly uniform enrichment of heavy elements measured at Jupiter (Figure 3) and the formation models are 
that it should be enriched by about the same factor as CH4, i.e. 60-100× solar, not depleted. [Some exceptions 
may apply to the noble gases whose delivery scenarios may govern their abundances, as discussed later.] So, 
that  begs  the  question  why  NH3 and  H2S are  so  much  depleted  to  great  depths.  The  answer  may  lie  in  the 
distribution  and  fate  of  water  on  Uranus  and  Neptune.  Perhaps,  very  deep  in  the  interiors  of  Uranus  and 
Neptune  NH3  has  high  enrichment  but  some  process  is  sequestering  it  and  possibly  also  H2S  down  there. 
Atmospheric  dynamics  alone  is  unlikely  to  explain  the  depletion,  considering  the  high  degree  of  observed 
depletion.  Two  potential  sinks  for  NH3  and  H2S  are  a  liquid  water  ocean  at  10  kilobar  or  deeper  and  an 
ionic/superionic ocean at 100’s of kilobars.  

The liquid water ocean is distinct from an aqueous ammonia cloud predicted by equilibrium thermodynamics 
models at a kilobar level (Sec. 4.1). As NH3 and H2S dissolve in water, their abundances would be depleted 
above such purported water ocean. However, there are two caveats: the degree of loss of NH3 and H2S in such 
an ocean and the very likelihood of the ocean’s existence. In a solar mix of gases, only 3% of ammonia may be 
removed by water at 300 K, and it drops at higher temperatures, where a water ocean might form. On the other 
hand, the solubility may be different at high pressures corresponding to the ocean depth. Preliminary modeling 
of  the  likelihood  of  a  liquid  water  ocean  between  the  cloud  tops  and  the  H2-rich  deep  interior  found  that 
Neptune is both too warm and too dry to form such an ocean (Wiktorowicz and Ingersoll 2007), and the same 
should apply to Uranus as well. Only future laboratory measurements and modeling will tell whether a liquid 
water ocean actually exists, and, if so, what quantities of NH3 and H2S it may actually remove.  

An ionic ocean provides another means for sequestering NH3 and H2S in the deep atmospheres of the icy giant 
planets. Presence of such an ocean was first suggested to explain the relatively large intrinsic magnetic field of 
Uranus measured by Voyager 2 (Ness et al. 1986), since metallic hydrogen, which drives the internal dynamo 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at Jupiter and Saturn, is not expected to form in the interiors of cooler, smaller icy giant planets. Subsequently, 
molecular dynamics calculations and experiments employing Raman spectroscopy in a laser heated diamond 
anvil cell showed a superionic phase of water forming at temperatures above 2000 K and pressures of 30 GPa 
(Goldman et al. 2005 and references therein for associated lab experiments). Ionic/superionic water is likely to 
incorporate ammonia into it (Atreya and Wong 2004, 2005), so that a plausible composition of such an ocean 
+·OH−]  together  with  free  electrons  to  maintain  charge  balance  in  the  plasma.  New  ab  initio 
is  [H3O+·NH4
calculations  also  support  formation  of  a  stable  ammonia-water  material  at  high  pressures  (Robinson  et  al. 
2018).  Such  an  ocean  might  take  in  some  hydrogen  sulfide  also.  Thus,  an  ionic/superionic  water  ocean  is  a 
potential  sink  for  ammonia  and  possibly  H2S  in  the  interiors  of  Uranus  and  Neptune,  resulting  in  their 
depletion at shallow tropospheric levels sensed by the VLA. Could such an ocean also serve as a sink of water? 
If water only changed to an ionic phase, it would not mean loss of water, just as hydrogen changing to metallic 
hydrogen  in  the  interior  of  Jupiter  does  not  imply  loss  of  hydrogen.  However,  if  water  combines  with  other 
species  such  as  NH3  and  H2S  it  could  “bind”  to  the  larger  compound,  which  may  serve  to  sequester  water 
itself. The actual depletion of water would depend on the degree to which water is ionized relative to its total 
reservoir  and  the  extent  and  efficiency  of  its  binding  properties  with  other  compounds.  Additional  modeling 
and  laboratory  studies  are  needed  to  test  the  feasibility  of  sequestration  of  volatiles  in  the  purported 
ionic/superionic ocean.    

3.3 Noble Gases 

Noble  gases  are  particularly  important  to  the  models  of  planetary  formation,  deep  interior  processes  and  the 
energy balance. Being chemically inert and non-condensible, the noble gases are not subject to variations over 
the planet unlike other volatiles discussed above. Though not a heavy element, helium has a special role in the 
giant planets. It may even control the fate of a heavy noble gas, neon, so we divide the discussion of the noble 
gases into two parts, one on He and Ne and the other on Ar, Kr and Xe. 

3.3.1 Helium, Neon, And The Planetary Interior and Heat Balance 

Helium condenses in the 1-2 megabar region in Jupiter’s interior. Neon dissolves in liquid helium (Roulston 
and Stevenson 1995; Wilson and Militzer 2010). Helium rain drops carry neon with them. As a consequence, 
the abundance of helium and neon would be depleted in the sensible troposphere. Galileo probe found just that. 
Helium was only 80% of its expected solar ratio to hydrogen, while neon was only 10% solar (Figure 8, Table 
2).  Latent  heat  released  upon  condensation  of  helium  together  with  the  conversion  of  potential  energy  to 
kinetic  energy  on  differentiation  of  helium  drops  from  molecular  hydrogen  gas  would  contribute  to  internal 
heat  of  the  planets.  Both  Jupiter  and  Saturn  emit  nearly  twice  as  much  heat  as  they  absorb  from  the  Sun.  A 
good fraction of the internal heat is likely due to gravitational contraction as the gas giants cool, contract and 
release their heat of accretion, but helium condensation is expected to make a significant contribution to the 
heat  budget  (see  Atreya  et  al.  2019a  for  additional  details).  Gravitational  contraction  is  expected  to  be 
negligible for the smaller icy giant planets, yet Neptune’s heat excess is similar to or greater than that of the 
gas giants, with the planet emitting nearly 2-3 times the energy absorbed from the Sun, whereas the internal 
energy of Uranus is less than 10%. What role might helium condensation play in the heat balance of the icy 
giant planets is a mystery. But, first, a precise determination of the helium abundance in their atmospheres is 
required, as was done at Jupiter by the Galileo probe. The presently available values of He mole fraction on 
Uranus  and  Neptune  from  Voyager  have  very  large  uncertainties  (Figure  8,  Table  2).  The  uncertainty  is 
inherent to the only method that could be applied to Uranus and Neptune – a combination of infrared spectra 
and the radio refractivity measurements – which depends on (poorly constrained) composition and temperature 
data (Gautier et al. 1995). Similarly, indirect retrievals of the He/H2 ratio from Voyager at Jupiter and Saturn 
had large uncertainties also. Only with direct, in situ measurements on Galileo probe, has it been possible to 
determine  the  precise  He/H2  ratio  on  Jupiter  (Table  2).  A  precise  determination  of  the  helium  and  neon 
abundances  in  the  upper  tropospheres  of  Uranus  and  Neptune  is  also  essential  to  understand  the  interior 
processes and heat balance of these icy giants.

3.3.2 Heavy Noble Gases – Ar, Kr, Xe 

How the volatiles were delivered is an important consideration for the formation models. In the following, we 
briefly summarize possible delivery scenarios, focusing only on the three heavy noble gases, Ar, Kr and Xe, 
whose  abundances  depend  on  the  particular  delivery  method.  Additional  details  are  given  in  Mousis  et  al. 
(2020).  

(i) Volatiles Adsorption On Amorphous Ice 
The building blocks of the giant planets may have been agglomerated from pristine materials originating from 
the interstellar medium. This scenario has been proposed to account for the (relatively) homogeneous volatile 
enrichments measured by the Galileo probe (Figure 3, Table 1) in Jupiter’s atmosphere (Owen et al. 1999) and 
could arguably apply to any of the four giant planets. In this case, laboratory experiments on amorphous ice 
show  that  the  fractionation  effects  are  negligible  between  the  adsorption  and  release  of  the  volatiles  at 
thermodynamic  conditions  relevant  to  the  PSN  (Bar-Nun  et  al.  2007).  This  implies  the  volatile  abundance 
ratios should remain identical once released compared to those in the gaseous mixture prior to adsorption by 
amorphous ice. Based on these properties, and under the assumption that the volatiles adsorbed on amorphous 
ice initially formed a protosolar mixture prior to trapping, Ar, Kr, and Xe should show enrichments similar to 
the  one  measured  for  C  in  the  atmospheres  of  Uranus  and  Neptune  (Figure  9).  Interestingly,  a  similar 
atmospheric signature can be predicted in the case of the gravitational collapse model. The two planets would 
have  initially  formed  from  the  collapse  of  a  cloud  made  of  protosolar  gas  and  the  settling  of  solid  grains 
conjugated with the photoevaporation of the envelope could lead to important volatiles enrichments, with no 
fractionation  mechanism  identified  so  far  (Mousis  et  al.  2018a).  However,  as  discussed  earlier,  the 
gravitational instability model faces numerous difficulties.

Figure  9.  Qualitative  differences  between  the  enrichments  in  volatiles  predicted  in  Uranus  and  Neptune  by  the  different 
formation scenarios (calibrations based on carbon (C/H) from the CH4 data). The resulting enrichments of the heavy noble 
gases,  Ar,  Kr  and  X,  are  shown  in  green  (crystalline  ice),  brown  (amorphous  ice),  blue  (clathrates),  and  shaded  brown 
(snowlines). [Mousis et al. 2020.] 

(ii) Crystalline Ices And Clathrates 
The  volatile  enrichments  in  Jupiter  (Figure  3,  Table  1)  have  also  been  interpreted  as  the  result  of  the  giant 
planet’s formation from building blocks agglomerated from (a) clathrates (Gautier et al. 2001; Hersant et al. 
2004;  Mousis  et  al.  2009),  (b)  crystalline  ices/pure  condensates  (Mousis  et  al.  2009),  and  also  (c)  from  a 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mixture of these two phases (Mousis et al. 2012, 2014). The latter hypothesis is supported by the composition 
of  comet  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko  measured  by  the  ROSINA  mass  spectrometer  aboard  the  Rosetta 
spacecraft  (Mousis  et  al.  2016,  2018b).  Two  extreme  members  can  be  considered:  agglomeration  of  Uranus 
and  Neptune’s  building  blocks  from  clathrates  or  from  pure  condensates  only.  In  the  former  case,  an 
interesting  property  of  the  clathration  mechanism  is  the  poor  propensity  of  Ar  for  trapping  in  the  clathrate 
cages  (Lunine  and  Stevenson  1985;  Mousis  et  al.  2016).  In  this  case,  the  accretion  of  clathrate-rich 
planetesimals or pebbles by Uranus and Neptune should be reflected by a protosolar argon abundance in their 
envelopes.  In  the  case  of  building  blocks  agglomerated  from  a  mixture  of  various  crystalline  ices,  the 
condensation sequence of the heavy noble gases indicates that pure crystalline ices of Xe, Kr, and Ar form at 
~38  K,  29  K,  and  22  K  in  the  PSN,  respectively  (Mousis  et  al.  2009).  Instead  of  having  a  flat  enrichment 
profile for the noble gases in the icy giant atmospheres as for the amorphous case, one should expect Xe/Ar 
and Kr/Ar ratios about 1.6 and 1.3 greater than their respective protosolar ratios, with a Kr enrichment similar 
to that of C (see Mousis et al. 2020 for details). 

(iii) Snowlines 
To explain the high C enrichment in Uranus and Neptune (Sec.3.1), as well as their “apparent” N deficiencies 
(Sec. 3.1) and their presumably high oxygen abundances, it has been proposed that the two planets formed in 
the vicinity of the CO pure condensate snowline in the PSN (Ali-Dib et al. 2014). By doing so, the amount of 
N2 ice was negligible in the feeding zone of the two icy giants, contrasting with the large amount of CO-rich 
solids present. In this mechanism, because the two icy giants were not located at the exact positions of the Ar, 
Kr,  and  Xe  snowlines,  these  noble  gases  should  show  depletions  in  their  formation  regions,  also  implying 
subsolar  abundances  in  the  envelopes  of  Uranus  and  Neptune  (Figure  9,  and  Mousis  et  al.  2020).  Another 
scenario  suggests  that  Jupiter  formed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  amorphous  ice  snowline,  location  at  which 
amorphous water crystallizes and releases the adsorbed volatiles to the PSN gas phase. This scenario proposes 
that Jupiter accreted water in solid form and the other volatiles in gaseous phase. While this mechanism works 
for Jupiter, it may run into difficulty for explaining the high C enrichment in Uranus and Neptune. 

3.4 Isotopic Ratios 

Isotopic  ratios  reveal  the  nature  of  the  source  material  of  the  planetary  building  blocks  and  the  atmospheric 
evolution. The isotopic ratios of argon, xenon and krypton on Jupiter measured by the Galileo probe confirmed 
them to be in the solar proportions (Table 3; Mahaffy et al. 2000). The solar composition was affirmed also by 
the  uniform  enrichment  of  all  measured  heavy  elements  within  the  range  of  uncertainty  (global  O/H  to  be 
determined  by  Juno).  None  of  the  isotopic  ratios  have  yet  been  measured  for  the  icy  giants,  as  they  require 
entry  probes.  Precise  measurements  of  the  noble  gas  isotopes  will  be  essential  to  determine  whether  the  icy 
giant planets also reflect the solar composition, like Jupiter, or altered by post-formation pollution. The D/H 
ratio is also important in this regard. The D/H ratio in hydrogen measured by Herschel-PACS and the Infrared 
Space Observatory (Feuchtgruber et al. 2013) is very similar for Uranus and Neptune (Table 3). It is found to 
be enriched by about a factor of 2 compared to the Jupiter and protosolar D/H (Table 3), but much lower than 
the  range  of  D/H  in  comets  (Figure  10),  which  led  the  authors  to  conclude  that  the  interiors  of  Uranus  and 
Neptune  are  rock-dominated,  with  ice  comprising  a  mere  14-32%  by  mass.  The  D/H  ratio  has  since  been 
measured  in  a  number  of  new  comets,  many  with  D/H  values  twice  as  high  as  the  upper  range  (3×10-4) 
assumed previously, which would imply the icy component as low as 7%. However, the actual ice/rock ratio 
depends on the history of planetary formation and evolution, mixing in the interior, etc., all of which are poorly 
constrained at this time. Measurements of D/H in CH4, abundances and isotopic ratios of key elements, gravity 
and  magnetic  field  data,  amongst  others,  are  required  on  any  future  icy  giant  planet  mission  to  test  various 
hypotheses  and  arrive  at  a  realistic  ice/rock  ratio  as  well  as  their  solid/gas  ratio.  Isotopic  ratio  of  C  in  CH4 
would  be  fairly  straightforward  to  measure  with  a  mass  spectrometer,  considering  virtually  no  overlap  from 
NH3 or H2O fragments due their highly depleted abundances. Comparison of  13C/12C with other solar system 
objects is important also to understand the history of formation and evolution of the icy giant planets. 15N/14N 
is  also  desirable,  but  unlikely  to  be  measured  due  to  very  low  abundance  of  NH3  in  the  sensible  part  of  the 
atmosphere.

4 Measurements  

Only  entry  probes  can  measure  the  volatiles  containing  key  heavy  elements,  helium  and  the  isotopic  ratios 
required  for  understanding  the  formation,  evolution  and  migration  scenarios  of  the  giant  planets.  Elemental 
abundances  of  Jupiter  are  well  covered  between  Galileo  and  Juno.  Only  C/H  has  been  measured  so  far  on 
Uranus and Neptune, and even that should be treated with caution, besides having large uncertainty (Sec. 3.1). 
Many more types of volatiles condense on the colder icy giant planets than Jupiter (Sec. 3.1 and 3.2) and their 
well-mixed abundances are much deeper, so a different approach is necessary.        

4.1 Insights Concerning Bulk Abundances of Water, Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide (O, N, S) 

The  discussion  of  bulk  composition  in  Sec.3  shows  that  the  condensible  volatiles,  NH3  and  H2S,  are  greatly 
depleted  down  to  at  least  several  tens  of  bar  levels  in  the  atmospheres  of  Uranus  and  Neptune.  Water  could 
also be depleted due to sequestration in purported liquid water ocean or an ionic/superionic ocean. Even in the 
absence of such oceans, the well-mixed region of water would lie at kilobar levels. If the O/H is as enriched as 
C/H, i.e. 80±20× solar, the water cloud at Uranus would form at ~1 kilobar  level based on equilibrium cloud 
condensation model (Figure 11; Neptune is very similar). However, well-mixed water may actually lie much 
deeper, perhaps even at tens of kilobar level, as Juno found for ammonia in Jupiter’s atmosphere, where the 
well-mixed  NH3  lies  several  tens  of  bars  below  its  condensation  level  of  ~0.7  bar  except  near  the  equator 
(Bolton  et  al.  2017,  Li  et  al.  2017).  This  means  that  with  the  exception  of  perhaps  methane,  direct  in  situ 
measurement  of  the  bulk  abundances  of  condensible  volatiles,  NH3,  H2S  and  H2O,  is  impractical,  as  current 
technology limits entry probe measurements to 5-10 bars at Uranus and Neptune.

Saturn’s  Ring  B,  Rhea,  Hyperion  and  Iapetus  have  similar  values,  all  close  to  SMOW,  so  the  plot  shows  an  average  of 
those  values.  Comet  names  have  been  abbreviated  in  the  plot,  and  they  are  103P:  Hartley  2,  67P:  Churyumov–

2012F6:  Lemmon,  2014Q2:  Lovejoy.  Venus  D/H  is  off  the  scale.  Its  values  are:  (5–6.5)  ×10-2  below  the  clouds,  and 
(2.5±0.5)×10-2 in 70–90 km range, and its ratios to SMOW are 160±32 below the clouds, and 320–417 in 70-90 km range. 

Even without direct measurements of N, S and O elemental ratios, however, valuable insights would be gained 
into  chemical  processes  operating  within  the  exotic  interiors  of  the  icy  giants.  Measuring  H2S  (and  perhaps 
even  NH3)  mixing  ratios  in  the  p  <  10  bar  region  would  provide  quantitative  constraints  on  the  relative 
affinities  of  these  species  to  deeper  water  layers,  and  may  perhaps  distinguish  between  NH4SH  or  (NH4)2S 
condensation  at  the  probe  descent  path.  A  single  probe  can  sample  only  one  location,  but  measurement  of 
volatiles  in  a  second  location,  perhaps  by  a  miniaturized  entry  probe  (Sayanagi  et  al.  2018),  would  help  to 
distinguish between chemical and dynamical atmospheric effects. 

Spatial  variation  in  volatile  concentrations  is  also  very  well  constrained  by  ground-based  or  orbiter 
observations, but remote sensing measurements are often challenged by degeneracies between temperature and 
compositional  variation  in  the  atmosphere  (e.g.,  Fletcher  et  al.  2016).  Probe  measurements  are  therefore 
extremely valuable as a ground truth capable of breaking such degeneracies, as evidenced by the large number 
of Jupiter remote sensing studies referencing probe measurements of He, CH4, and thermal structure (von Zahn 
et al. 1998, Niemann et al. 1998, Wong et al. 2004, Seiff et al. 1998).

Figure 11. Comparison of the depth of a water cloud on Uranus and Jupiter for different abundances of well-mixed water 
(O/H)  relative  to  its  solar  value.  On  Jupiter,  the  water  cloud  would  form  at  ~6  bar  level  if  O/H  is  similar  to  the  other 
elements, i.e. ~3× solar (Table 1), whereas on Uranus it would form at a kilobar level is O/H = C/H, which is ~80× solar 
(Table 1). See Fig. 5 caption for discussion of cloud densities and cloud base pressure levels. 

4.2 Noble Gases are Key for The Icy Giant Planets  

The heavy noble gases, Ar, Kr and Xe − being chemically inert and non condensible on the icy giants − are 
expected to be well-mixed everywhere below the homopause, not subject to any dynamical effects unlike the 
condensible volatiles (see Sec. 3.3.1 for He and Ne). However, their abundances are low, with solar Xe/H at 
only a tenth of a ppbv and Kr/H just ten times higher. Thus, measurements done at atmospheric pressures of a 
few bars would give greater signal to noise ratio, allowing accurate determination of all noble gases and their 
isotopes, as on the Galileo probe at Jupiter. Another set of measurements a few bars below would be important 
for confirmation and robustness of the data. Unlike the condensible species, noble gas measurements done in a 
single location of an entry probe should be representative of their global values.  

4.3 Complementary Observations on Composition and Atmospheric Dynamics 

4.3.1 Oxygen Elemental Abundance from CO?  

As seen earlier in this section, water is too deep for in situ investigation, hence unsuitable for determining the 
oxygen elemental abundance of the icy giant planets. CO is another reservoir of oxygen, albeit a minor one, in 
the atmosphere of the giant planets. CO is a disequilibrium species in the atmospheres of the giant planets. Its 
presence  in  the  upper  troposphere  implies  strong  convective  upwelling  from  its  thermochemical  equilibrium 
level in the deep atmosphere, as is implied also by other disequilibrium species, such as PH3, GeH4 and AsH3, 
all  of  which  have  been  detected  in  the  upper  troposphere/lower  stratosphere  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn.  The  first 
detection  of  CO  in  the  atmosphere  of  Neptune  was  made  at  submillimeter  wavelength  of  345.8  GHz  with 
JCMT (Marten et al. 1993). It was found to be present both in the stratosphere and the troposphere, and the 
data  were  consistent  with  a  uniform  mixing  ratio  of  1.2×10-6.  More  recent  observations  derive  a  stepped 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vertical  profile,  with  a  high  upper  atmospheric  CO  concentration  and  a  smaller  concentration  in  the  deeper 
atmosphere. These stepped profiles, when applied to recent millimeter and submillimeter Neptune spectra, are 
consistent with deep CO concentrations of 0.1 to 0.6 ppm (Lellouch et al. 2005, Hesman et al. 2007, Moreno et 
al.  2011,  Luszcz-Cook  and  de  Pater  2013,  Teanby  et  al.  2019).  However,  the  results  are  model  dependent. 
Luszcz-Cook and de Pater (2013) found that their observations could be fit with zero tropospheric CO if there 
was  additional  absorption  from  10×  solar  or  more  H2S  and  the  apparent  absence  of  NH3  absorption  in  the 
microwave  spectrum  (Sec.  3.1).  Furthermore,  Teanby  et  al.  (2019)  found  that  stepped  profiles  may 
overestimate the deeper tropospheric CO concentration, because their results only required nonzero CO in the 
upper part of the troposphere at P < 0.5 bar. Herschel/SPIRE observations (15–52 cm–1) set the most stringent 
upper limit of 2.1 ppb in the upper troposphere of Uranus (Teanby and Irwin 2013).  

Models of disequilibrium species concentrations often combine complex thermochemical kinetic schemes with 
parameterized one-dimensional (vertical) diffusion. The models span the vertical range between the observable 
troposphere  down  to  levels  where  thermochemical  equilibrium  describes  the  partitioning  between  different 
molecular  species,  such  as  CO  and  CH4  for  carbon.  One  goal  of  this  modeling  approach  is  to  relate  CO 
observations to the bulk C/H and O/H ratios. On Jupiter, Wang et al. (2016) combined the Bézard et al. (2002) 
tropospheric CO volume mixing ratio of 1 ppb with a deep eddy mixing parameter Kzz near 108 cm2 s–1. They 
constrained  the  O/H  ratio  to  the  0.1–0.75×  solar  range  using  the  reaction  network  of  Visscher  and  Moses 
(2011), or the 3–11× solar range using reaction network from Venot et al. (2012). Spectroscopic constraints on 
the  water  cloud  condensation  level  in  Bjoraker  et  al.  (2018)  preclude  the  subsolar  O/H  derived  with  the 
Visscher and Moses (2011) reaction network. 

On Uranus, the CO volume mixing ratio (VMR) upper limits have not been able to set useful constraints on 
O/H (Cavalié et al. 2014, Teanby and Irwin 2013). On Neptune, a CO VMR of 1 ppm was used by Lodders 
and Fegley (1994) to set limits of O/H = 670× solar (updated to the Asplund et al. 2009 values). Luszcz-Cook 
and  de  Pater  (2013)  used  updated  CO  measurements,  rate-limiting  reactions,  and  effective  mixing  length  to 
revise  the  O/H  ratio  downward  to  500×  solar,  but  when  they  included  H2S  absorption,  their  model  was 
consistent  with  zero  tropospheric  CO,  similar  to  the  preferred  model  of  Teanby  et  al.  (2019).  A  more 
comprehensive discussion may be found in Cavalié et al. (2017, and this issue).    

Above  discussion  illustrates  the  difficulty  of  deriving  the  O/H  ratio  from  CO.  The  results  are  highly  model 
dependent and results are inconclusive due to lack of meaningful constraints on input parameters such vertical 
mixing,  thermochemistry,  reaction  kinetics,  etc.  Further  complications  could  arise  depending  on  the  relative 
positions of the ionic ocean and the quenching level for H2O/CO thermochemical equilibrium. Nevertheless, 
modeling efforts should continue considering that CO may be the only candidate for getting at possible range 
of oxygen elemental abundance on the icy giant planets. A gas chromatograph together with mass spectrometer 
(GCMS) has a good chance of making the CO measurement in situ in the troposphere in order to discriminate 
between N2 and CO both at 28 daltons. Remote sensing observations of the other disequilibrium species from 
the orbiter can provide some insight into diffusion from their thermochemical equilibrium levels in the deep 
atmosphere to the lower stratosphere. 

4.3.2 Microwave Remote Sensing: Dynamics from Vertical Profiles of H2O and NH3 

Juno’s  microwave  radiometer  (MWR)  is  designed  to  determine  the  bulk  abundance  of  water  in  the  deep 
atmosphere  of  Jupiter  (Janssen  et  al.  2017),  hence  the  oxygen  elemental  ratio.  The  contribution  function  of 
MWR’s  longest  wavelength  channel  (50  cm,  0.6  GHz)  peaks  at  ~100  bars,  with  half  the  contribution  still 
coming  from  as  deep  as  1  kilobar.  A  similar  instrument  on  an  orbiting  spacecraft  could  be  a  useful  tool  for 
measuring both water and the ammonia abundances down to deep atmospheric levels of Uranus and Neptune. 
An  advantage  of  the  Juno  MWR  over  ground-based  observations  is  that  it  can  conduct  atmospheric 
observations  inside  the  radiation  belts,  which  produce  non-thermal  (synchrotron)  emission.  Although 
synchrotron  radiation  is  not  a  concern  for  ground  based  observations  of  the  icy  giants  (Fig.  6),  spacecraft 
observations  will  be  able  to  achieve  higher  spatial  resolution.  Ground-based  millimeter/microwave 
observations show hints of spatial variation to levels as deep as 30-50 bar, but spatial resolution is limited at 
the longest (and deepest-probing) wavelengths where the planet is only a few times larger than the beam size 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(de Pater et al. 2014, Tollefson et al. 2019b). But measurements reaching down to kilobar levels may not be 
deep  enough  for  the  well-mixed  water,  NH3  and  H2S,  as  discussed  above.  Thus  even  microwave  remote 
sensing  is  unlikely  to  yield  the  O,  N  or  S  elemental  ratios.  On  the  other  hand,  a  global  map  of  vertical 
distribution of H2O, H2S and NH3 measured by a microwave radiometer on an orbiter can provide exceptional 
data  on  the  dynamical  processes  down  to  kilobar  levels.  Interpretation  of  this  type  of  orbiter  data  would  be 
greatly facilitated by probe measurements of temperature and composition (particularly microwave-absorbing 
species)  in  the  upper  part  of  the  troposphere.  A  detailed  study  of  the  feasibility  and  science  return  of 
microwave radiometry on an orbiter at Uranus and Neptune is required.       

5 Implementation: Possible Mission Design and Architecture Concepts 

The  focus  of  this  paper  is  on  fundamental  questions  such  as  the  formation  and  migration  of  the  icy  giant 
planets, which only entry probes can address. However, in situ measurements must be placed in the broader 
context of Uranus/Neptune system science, which require complementary remote sensing observations from an 
orbiter.  Ideally,  such  a  mission  would  be  similar  to  NASA’s  Galileo  orbiter-probe  mission  at  Jupiter.  Less 
costly missions than a full-up Flagship class mission, such as a Juno-like New Frontiers class mission but with 
an entry probe, may be feasible to address limited but focused science objectives. A good insight into possible 
missions to the icy giants can be had by looking at the main conclusions of NASA’s pre-Decadal Ice Giants 
Science  Definition  Team  study  (IG  SDT  Report)  for  which  NASA’s  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL) 
developed  an  array  of  mission  designs  and  system  architectures.  The  SDT-recommended  minimal  concept 
from that study is an orbiter with probe to either Uranus or Neptune. The most comprehensive concept studied 
is a dual-spacecraft, dual-planet mission that could explore both Uranus and Neptune. This section will provide 
an  overview  of  a  typical  stand-alone  Neptune  mission  because  it  includes  all  elements  of  these  three 
architectures. This will be followed by a brief description of the differences for a typical Uranus stand-alone 
and dual-spacecraft, dual-planet concepts. Launch and technology opportunities are also summarized.  

5.1 A Typical Stand-alone Neptune Mission    

Neptune’s  distance  from  Earth  and  the  interplanetary  travel  time  to  get  there  are  significant  architectural 
drivers  given  the  lifetime  constraints  of  NASA’s  eMMRTG  (enhanced  Multi-Mission  Radioisotope 
Thermoelectric Generator) power system. Neptune can be further than Pluto, depending upon where Pluto is in 
its  orbit.  Early  estimates  indicate  that  a  Neptune  orbiter  with  the  payload  complement  specified  by  the  SDT 
would exceed 1,000 kg dry mass. This mass, coupled with mass of a Neptune atmospheric probe, leads to the 
conclusion that a solar electric propulsion or SEP-based architecture is required to deliver the spacecraft into 
orbit and complete the science mission within the design life of the radioisotope power system. This cannot be 
achieved with a chemical propulsion alternative. Figure 12 illustrates key elements of a typical Neptune flight 
system architecture. Payload elements are notional and not meant to imply endorsement or flight readiness.  

The mission design shown in Figure 13 can be divided into three mission phases: interplanetary cruise, probe 
release and data relay, and Neptune orbit insertion. 

The interplanetary trajectory relies on a 25-kW SEP stage powered by 3 NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thrusters 
(NEXT ion engines) to propel the spacecraft through the inner solar system (see IG SDT Report for additional 
details).  No  additional  maneuvers  are  required  between  probe  release  and  NOI.  Post-launch,  the  spacecraft 
applies the SEP stage to gain momentum, perform an Earth flyby followed by a Jupiter flyby, and transition 
onto a long coast phase toward Neptune. The SEP stage makes up for the relatively low launch energy through 
use of high propellant efficiency and continuous thrust arcs.  

At  a  range  of  ~6  AU,  where  the  solar  insolation  becomes  insufficient  for  SEP  to  be  effective,  the  stage  is 
jettisoned. Releasing it before Neptune Orbit Insertion (NOI) reduces mass and enables significant propellant 
savings.  

The  probe  is  released  ~60  days  prior  to  Neptune  atmospheric  entry.  A  probe-targeting  maneuver  (PTM)  is 
performed prior to probe release, followed by an Orbiter Divert and Periapsis Targeting Maneuver to achieve

the desired conditions for orbit insertion. The probe enters Neptune’s atmosphere at an entry flight path angle 
(EFPA)  of  -20  degrees.  While  this  relatively  shallow  EFPA  constrains  the  probe-orbiter  telecommunication 
geometry, it is required to reduce deceleration and heat loads. Due to the relatively low data rate requirements, 
this geometry is more than adequate for full mission data return. The probe descent to 10 bar lasts for ~1 hr, of 
which the first ~30 mins represent the entry sequence.  

Following probe relay, the orbiter performs a large orbit insertion maneuver (~2.7 km/s delta v for Neptune, 
~2.0  km/s  for  Uranus)  at  an  altitude  of  ~1.05  Neptune  Radii  and  enters  in  a  252-day  retrograde  orbit  for  a 
typical Neptune mission studied. The orbit insertion altitude is chosen to mitigate potential ring crossing issues 
and  to  lower  the  NOI  delta  v.  Figure  14  shows  the  NOI  location,  orbiter  path,  probe  approach  and  probe 
descent trajectory.

Figure 14.  Neptune orbit insertion accommodates probe data relay during descent 

The atmospheric probe design draws on heritage from Galileo and Pioneer Venus probes, using current state of 
the art technologies and instrument designs. The probe is spin stabilized during its coast to the planet and is 
powered  by  primary  batteries.  Survival  heating  after  probe  release  and  during  the  60-day  coast  period  is 
provided by radioisotope heater units (RHUs). The overall configuration, including SDT example instrument 
complement is illustrated in Figure 15. 

The  probe  descent  module  is  a  truncated  sphere,  approximately  73  cm  in  diameter.  The  descent  module  is 
vented, allowing an equalization of pressure inside the probe with the external atmosphere during its descent. 
Apertures in the probe provide instrument access to the atmosphere. Telecom uses a flat patch antenna on the 
top  of  the  probe  to  maintain  a  communications  link  with  the  orbiter  during  the  probes  ~60-minute  science 
retrieval. 

The probe entry system consists of a Galileo 45-degree sphere-cone heat shield scaled to 1.2 m in diameter, 
and a spherical backshell with a radius of curvature originating at the vehicle center of gravity (CG). The heat 
shield  uses  a  3D  weave  of  blended  carbon/phenolic  yarns  (Heat  Shield  for  Extreme  Entry  Environment, 
HEEET)  under  development  by  NASA’s  Ames  Research  Center.  The  backshell  TPS  (Thermal  Protection 
System)  is  flight  proven  PICA  (Phenolic  Impregnated  Carbon  Ablator).  The  mass  of  the  probe  at  entry  is 
estimated to be ~308 kg.  

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15. Conceptual design of probe descent module is based on mature flight proven elements. 

The probe instrument suite as shown in Figure 15 comprises four notional instruments: 

•  Mass Spectrometer (MS or GCMS) 
•  Atmospheric Structure Instrument (ASI) 
•  Nephelometer  
•  Ortho/Para Hydrogen Experiment (OPH) 

Only two instruments on the probe – MS/GCMS, and ASI – are absolutely critical to address the fundamental 
questions of planetary formation. A helium detector may be included for redundancy, as on the Galileo probe 
at  Jupiter,  but  is  not  required.  MS/GCMS  and  ASI  have  a  long  heritage,  having  flown  successfully  on  a 
number of planetary spacecraft including Galileo, Huygens, Pioneer Venus, MSL, etc. Other instruments may 
also be considered for inclusion on payload depending on available resources and compelling science drivers.    

While the baseline launch vehicle assumption for the scenario presented in this paper is a Delta IV-Heavy, the 
availability of Space Launch System (SLS) or another rocket with similar capability would allow: 

(a)  Reduced  flight  times  and/or  increased  delivered  mass  to  either  icy  giant  planet.  This  allows  additional 
tradeoffs between cost and science return. 
(b) Two-planet, two-spacecraft missions on a single launch vehicle.  

5.2 A Typical Stand-alone Uranus Mission 
A Uranus concept would be similar to that discussed for Neptune however the solar electric propulsion (SEP) 
stage on the carrier spacecraft would not be necessary because Uranus is significantly closer to Earth thereby 
reducing  flight  times  enough  to  meet  the  NASA  eMMRTG  design  lifetime  constraint.  The  basic  spacecraft

Figure 16. Dual-spacecraft, dual-planet mission scenario. 

5.3 Dual Planet Mission   

While there are multiple options that can be considered for a dual planet mission, the example scenario studied 
is  shown  in  Figure  16.  Both  spacecraft  could  launch  together  on  a  NASA  Space  Launch  System  or  another 
rocket  of  equivalent  capability.  Both  spacecraft  are  stacked  on  top  of  the  SEP  stage  and  remain  that  way 
throughout  the  inner  solar  system  tour.  Just  before  arriving  in  the  vicinity  of  Jupiter,  they  separate  and  each 
does its own Jupiter gravity assist (JGA) to put them on their respective trajectories to Uranus and Neptune. 
The SEP stage stays with the Uranus spacecraft for additional post JGA thrusting and then jettisoned at ~6 AU 
beyond which SEP stage is no longer effective. While both spacecraft can be launched on the SLS, there is no 
scientific penalty to launching two-planet missions on different launch vehicles several years apart.  

5.4 Launch Opportunities 

Launch to an icy giant planet is generally possible any year, but there are significant variations in performance 
(results  from  more  than  10,000  trajectories  can  be  found  in  IG  SDT  Report).  As  shown  in  Table  4,  the 
availability  of  Jupiter  gravity  assist  maximizes  delivered  mass  resulting  in  preferential  launch  windows  for 
Uranus  missions  in  the  2030–2034  timeframe  and  a  corresponding  window  of  2029–  2030  for  Neptune.  In 
these favorable periods chemical trajectories could deliver ample mass for the Uranus missions studied in an 
11-year  flight  time,  using  a  launch  performance  capability  similar  to  the  Atlas  V  551.  Neptune  trajectories 
utilizing solar electric propulsion (SEP) can deliver a similar mass to Neptune orbit in 13 years using launch 
performance capability similar to the Delta IV-H. There are no all-chemical trajectories to Neptune, even using 
a  Delta  IV-H,  that  yield  a  mission  duration  less  than  15  years,  a  design  target  chosen  to  be  consistent  with 
Radioisotope Power System (RPS) design life and mission reliability. Significant science can be done during 
gravity assists at a gas giant. If a Saturn flyby is preferred over the Jupiter gravity assist, only trajectories to 
Uranus  are  available  in  the  next  decade,  and  launch  must  occur  before  mid-2028.  The  use  of  SEP  for  inner 
solar system thrusting has the potential to significantly reduce flight times to Uranus and/or increase delivered 
mass. The SEP stage would be used as far out as 6 AU, at which point solar power is insufficient to provide 
additional thrusting and the SEP stage would be jettisoned. SEP-enhanced mission concept designs also see a 
slight  preference  in  launch  dates  corresponding  to  availability  of  Jupiter  gravity  assists,  but  well-performing 
trajectories are possible in any year of the period studied.

(a) 
-Best Launch Years (JGA) in row 2 show the “best” years to launch, when most mass margin is possible regardless of 
launch vehicle or propulsion type, but subject to color-coded TOF limits shown in the bottom two rows. The second and 
subsequent lines of launch years (rows 4-8) show the “Launch-no-Later-than” years for corresponding 
LV+PropulsionSystem combination indicated on each row. Launching later than those years would not allow flying an 
orbiter class mission. Technically, with SEP and Delta IV-H, an orbiter class 12-yr TOF mission to Uranus could be 
launched in any launch year (row 5); however, the “best” launch years with highest mass margin are 2030-2034 (row 2). 
Similarly, SEP and Delta IV-H combination allows launching to Neptune in any launch year (row 8), but the TOF would 
be prohibitively long, 20-25 years. 
-JGAs confer a significant advantage in delivered mass and flight time. 
-JGA is available for a few years around 2030; next Launch opportunity w/ JGAs is around 2046. 
-Launching after indicated dates results in insufficient mass delivered for orbiter-class mission. 
(b)Color code: salmon, yellow and brown colors indicate interplanetary portion of time of flight (TOF) cases in table cells. 

There  are  no  trajectories  that  allow  a  single  spacecraft  to  encounter  both  Uranus  and  Neptune.  As  discussed 
above, a single SLS launch vehicle could, however, launch two spacecraft, one to each icy giant planet. 

5.5 Technology Considerations   

The  IG  SDT  identified  only  two  technologies  as  enabling  for  a  mission  to  either  Uranus  or  Neptune: 
appropriate  thermal  protection  system  for  the  probe  and  power  source  for  the  spacecraft.  Heatshield  for 
Extreme  Entry  Environment  Technology  (HEEET)  would  be  enabling  for  the  entry  conditions  of  probes  at 
both  Uranus  and  Neptune.  The  development  of  HEEET  is  complete,  and  has  achieved  Technical  Readiness 
Level 6 (Gage et al. 2019; Venkatapathy et al. 2020). The eMMRTG would provide a significant improvement 
in  specific  power  over  the  existing  MMRTG  technology  at  beginning  of  life  but,  more  importantly,  a  much 
larger gain at end of life, which is critical, given the duration of an icy giant planet mission. Its development is 
proceeding well (Matthes et al. 2019). 

A number of new technologies, while not necessary to enable the mission concepts described, could have an 
impact on the performance and/or cost of the mission if available: 1) Aerocapture could enable trip times to be 
shortened,  delivered  mass  to  be  increased  or  both.  2)  Cryogenic  propulsion  could  have  similar  but  not  as 
pronounced effects. 3) Next generation RPS technologies, with even better specific power than the proposed 
eMMRTG, such as a segmented modular RTG (aka Next-Generation RTG), could enable more mass or power 
for instruments or both. 4) Advanced telecommunications technologies/capabilities could dramatically increase

the  data  return  from  an  outer  planet  mission  and  5)  Mission  operations  autonomy  technologies  could  drive 
down cost and permit more adaptive missions operations than are envisaged in the missions reported here. 

6 Summary and Conclusions   

Only  entry  probes  are  capable  of  determining  the  abundances  and  isotopic  ratios  of  elements  required  to 
constrain models of the formation of Uranus and Neptune. Noble gases and their isotopic ratios, in particular, 
are key, and accessible at relatively shallow depths. Noble gas measurements can be carried out at pressures of 
about 1 bar, but probes deployed to 5-10 bar level would allow sampling at multiple depths for confirmation, 
as well as collection of data on other volatiles. Well-mixed ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and possibly water, are 
likely  too  deep  for  any  in  situ  or  remote  sensing  observations.  Their  lack  is  not  detrimental,  however, 
especially  in  view  of  robust  data  on  the  noble  gases  and  comparative  planetology  with  the  gas  giants, 
especially Jupiter with its full suite of elemental and isotope abundances. The most critical payload elements of 
an  entry  probe  are  a  mass  spectrometer  and  an  atmospheric  structure  instrument.  Observations  of  the  height 
profiles of H2O, NH3 and H2S to the deepest levels possible, e.g. with microwave remote sensing from orbit 
and  Earth,  would  be  valuable  to  an  understanding  of  the  atmospheric  dynamics.  Measurements  of  gravity, 
magnetic  field  and  stratospheric  composition  and  structure  from  an  orbiter  are  highly  complementary  to  the 
probe data, and together they would result in robust models of planetary interior and formation. Exploration of 
Uranus or Neptune requires no new mission enabling technology efforts; development of certain technologies 
may  result  in  shorter  cruise,  increased  payload  mass  and  more  flexible  launch  opportunities,  however. 
International  partnership  is  most  desirable  for  maximizing  the  science  return  of  an  icy  giant  planet  mission. 
Possible contribution to a NASA-led mission may include a probe, a second spacecraft for the dual-spacecraft, 
dual-planet  option,  cubesats  or  smallsats  for  certain  specific,  targeted  measurements.  Uranus  and  Neptune 
remain as the last major pieces of the outer solar system formation puzzle. Their detailed exploration with an 
orbiter and probe is thus essential for a comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolution of the solar 
system, and, by extension, the most common type of planets confirmed to date in the extrasolar systems.
