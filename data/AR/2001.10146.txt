Abstract

A recently developed model to describe proton collisions from molecules involving basic atoms

such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus (H, C, N, O, P) is extended to treat

collisions with multiply charged ions. The ion-atom collisions are computed using the two-center

basis generator method (TC-BGM), which has a proven track record of yielding accurate total cross

sections for electron capture and ionization. The atomic net ionization cross sections are then used to

assemble two models for ion-molecule collisions: an independent atom model (IAM) that follows the

Bragg additivity rule (labeled IAM-AR), and also the so-called pixel-counting method (IAM-PCM).

The latter yields reduced cross sections relative to IAM-AR near the maximum, since it takes into

account the overlapping nature of eﬀective cross sectional areas. The IAM-PCM for higher-charge

projectiles leads to strong reductions of net ionization cross sections relative to the IAM-AR method,

and is computed directly for projectile charges Q = 1, 2, 3. The scaling behavior of the IAM-PCM is

investigated over a wide range of energies E, and at high E it converges towards the IAM-AR. An

empirical scaling rule based on the IAM-PCM results is established which allows to reproduce these

results based on proton impact calculations. Detailed comparisons are provided for the uracil target

(C4H4N2O2), for which other theoretical as well as experimental results are available. Data are also

shown for targets such as water (H2O), methane (CH4), adenine (C5H5N5), L-valine (C5H11NO2),

and the nucleotide dAMP (C10H14N5O6P). Based on the scaling model derived from the IAM-PCM

cross sections it is shown how the experimental data for uracil and water bombarded by multiply

charged ions can be reduced to eﬀective Q = 1 cross sections respectively, and these are compared

to proton impact data.

INTRODUCTION

The understanding of ionization in charged-particle impact on biologically relevant

molecules is an important prerequisite for ion beam cancer therapy. In order to perform

simulations of radiation damage caused by the projectile ions, the secondary electrons and

molecular charged fragments produced during collisions [1], one ﬁrst has to study the fun-

damental processes of ion collisions with molecules in the gas/vapor phase, and this has

been the motivation for experimental and theoretical studies. Important target molecules

in this context are water (for which theoretical studies can be performed as extensions of

ion-atom collisions), and biomolecules that form the DNA and RNA. The RNA base uracil

(C4H4N2O2) was chosen as a candidate for extensive experimentation and was reported

on together with theoretical analyses [2, 3]. Theoretical treatment of ionization of these

biomolecules escapes at this point the capabilities of sophisticated quantum-mechanical

modelling, but ﬁrst attempts have been made [4–6]. The net ionization cross sections for

biomolecules are very large due to their size and number of available valence electrons.

In Ref. [7] an experimental (and theoretical) investigation of p-uracil collisions summarizes

how the ionization cross section grows with the number of valence electrons. This idea also

forms the basis of a theoretical approach that combines ion-atom scattering calculations

within the continuum distorted wave with eikonal initial state approach (CDW-EIS), which

also uses information from the molecular orbital energy-level structure to imprint some

molecular character on the model. Another approach that was used with some success is

an independent-molecule model, where parametrizations of experimental total ionization

cross section data for proton collisions with small constituent molecules are used to assemble

results for the uracil target [8].

Independent-atom models (IAM) were studied extensively for proton impact in our

group [9–12]. On the basis of proton-atom collision calculations performed using the two-

center basis generator method (TC-BGM) [13] one can form simply an estimate for the

ion-molecule cross section by the Bragg additivity rule, and this was called the IAM-AR

model. This somewhat naive addition rule should provide the correct high-impact-energy

limit when the ionization cross section becomes small. A much more sophisticated IAM

was introduced and tested in these works, which models the ion-molecule collision process

for a given orientation of the molecule by considering the projectile ion as observing an

3

eﬀective cross sectional area that is formed as the overlap of all atomic cross sections. This

geometric overlap is easily calculated by pixelization, and therefore the method was called

the pixel counting method (PCM). This method gives substantially reduced cross sections

for net ionization and net capture as compared to the IAM-AR method, but goes over into it

by construction when the cross sections become small and the overlap disappears, i.e., the

measured area corresponds to the sum of all atomic cross sections. Quite relevant for the

present work is the fact that the IAM-PCM results for net ionization in p-uracil collisions

at the energies E = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 MeV match the experimental data quite well, as does the

CDW-EIS theory for proton impact [7]. In Ref.[11] a detailed comparison between IAM-AR,

IAM-PCM and molecular-orbital energy based models is provided for proton-pyrimidine

(C4H4N2) collisions in Fig. 2a, and it is evident that the shape of the IAM-PCM cross

sections begins to deviate at energies below E = 1 MeV/amu from AR and the other models.

A comparison for the case of adenine molecules is provided in Fig. 3 of Ref. [12].

An important measure that helps to understand how theory and experiment match up is

the scaling behavior of the ionization cross sections with projectile charge Q and collision

energy E or impact velocity v. An experimental (and theoretical) investigation of charged-ion

collisions with uracil [3] found that even in the MeV/amu collision energy regime perturbative,

and even distorted-wave theory are not in good agreement. It is argued that the experimental

cross section scales approximately as η1.5, where η = Q/v is the Sommerfeld parameter. The

CDW-EIS theory overestimates the experimental data by more than a factor of two. Thus, it

is important to investigate the situation using a theory that is not rooted in the Born series

or its distorted-wave siblings. A recent IAM based on a stoichiometric argument and CDW-

EIS theory for ion-atom collisions [14] makes an attempt at scaling by deﬁning a reduced

CDW-EIS cross section, which however fails to reconcile the proton impact measurements [7]

with the Q = 4 − 8 data of Ref. [3] with a diﬀerence of about a factor of three (cf. Fig. 5 in

Ref. [14]). This problem shows that the scaling problem has remained unresolved, and it

therefore represents a major thrust for the present work. We also note that the follow-up

work from the CDW-EIS scaling approach [15] is not attempting to reconcile their ﬁndings

with all measured uracil data.

A signiﬁcant body of ionization data for atoms and molecules, including some biomolecules
has been treated theoretically by a semiclassical method that represents an (cid:126) = 0 limit of

quantum mechanics, namely the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method which

4

simulates quantum mechanics by classical statistical mechanics. It allows to obtain diﬀerential

electron emission cross sections and is non-perturbative. Molecules can be described by multi-

center eﬀective model potentials adopted from quantum structure calculations. For the water

molecule target bombarded by highly charged ions a detailed comparison against CDW-EIS

results and experiments was carried out recently in a model that includes time-dependent

screening parameters that change with electron removal from the molecule [16].

Experimental data for charged-particle impact with Q = 1, 2, 3 on water molecules have

been obtained for a wide range of collision energies [17–21], and for the remainder of the

Introduction we focus on this target molecule. For higher charges Q measurements are

available at higher collision energies [22–25] in the form of diﬀerential electron emission cross

sections together with CDW-EIS theory, and integration of the diﬀerential data determines

total ionization cross sections.

Calculations based on the TC-BGM were carried out for proton-H2O collisions by repre-

senting the self-consistent ﬁeld molecular orbitals in terms of an expanded atomic oxygen

basis generated by the optimized potential method of density functional theory [26]. Not

all molecular orientations could be treated, but arguments were given how the total cross

sections could be estimated on the basis of a subset of orientations. The method was applied

successfully to the cases of proton projectiles [27] and a fragmentation model was developed

and compared to experimental data [28]. The work was extended to He+ collisions including

the treatment of projectile electron loss [29]. The experimental work on Li3+ collisions was

supported using this methodology [21]. However, the extension to higher multiply charged

projectiles turned out to be diﬃcult (despite some additional encouraging results for He2+

projectiles [30]), and the program was not pursued further in favor of the IAM-PCM ap-

proach. The main motivation for this was that TC-BGM ion-atom calculations are pushed to

convergence including a proper representation of the discrete excited states of the constituent

atoms. This turns out to be diﬃcult for the ion-molecule TC-BGM calculations, in part due

to the representation in terms of atomic oxygen basis states. A proper representation of the

molecular discrete excitation spectrum requires a correlated quantum chemistry approach [31].

Thus, it is not clear whether a limited representation within the framework of the TC-BGM

ion-molecule calculations is capable of separating accurately the continuum contributions

from discrete excitations.

Other groups tested methods based on the semiclassical approach where the electronic wave

5

function developed in a molecular orbital basis is propagated in time [32] and obtained diﬀerent

(higher) net ionization cross sections at low energies. A full three-center single-electron

CTMC model potential was designed [33] that gained popularity within the community with

extensive sampling of molecular orientations. The potential was also used in numerical grid

calculations [34] at higher collision energies.

An attempt at scaling was recently made in the context of CTMC calculations [35] by

graphing the net ionization cross section divided by the projectile charge Q against E(cid:48) = E/Q.

The CTMC data run approximately parallel to the CDW-EIS data and experimental data

at high energies, and begin to deviate from experimental data as they approach E(cid:48) =

100 keV/amu. from above. The question whether the cross section data can be scaled within

the maximum region therefore also remains open up to now.

A recently introduced CTMC mean ﬁeld model with dynamic screening on projectile and

target has been used to make extensive comparisons with the data and explored the question

of saturation behavior in the net cross sections by looking at them as a function of the

Sommerfeld parameter η = Q/v [36]. No obvious scaling was observed in these calculations

when looking at the entire energy range in the data.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we introduce the theoretical basis for the

current work. Sect. II A presents new results for TC-BGM ion-atom calculations for He2+

and Li3+ projectiles; for atomic hydrogen targets the results are compared with theory and

experiment. In Sect. II B we demonstrate the scaling behavior of ion-molecule collisions

with respect to projectile charge Q and collision energy E in the IAM-AR and IAM-PCM

approaches for the targets uracil and water. A parametrization of the scaling behavior is

then used to generate cross section for arbitrary projectile charge on the basis of IAM-PCM

proton impact data. Sect. III serves to provide a detailed comparison of the scaling behavior:

in Sect. III A for uracil and in Sect. III B for water. The paper ends with a few concluding
remarks in Sect. IV. Atomic units, characterized by (cid:126) = me = e = 4π(cid:15)0 = 1, are used unless

otherwise stated.

II. MODEL

In this section we present arguments that lead to the theoretical data-driven empirical

scaling models for the net ionization cross sections according to the IAM-AR and IAM-PCM

6

models using the uracil target molecule C4H4N2O2 as an example. It is a good example

from several points of view: on the one hand it contains four diﬀerent atoms, and ionization

shouldn’t be dominated by any one of them, and on the other hand it is a target for which

systematic experimental studies in the gas phase were carried out. The model will then later

be conﬁrmed by looking at the water molecule (vapor phase), for which again, a number of

experiments with diﬀerently charged projectile ions are available.

A.

Ion-atom collisions

Results from new TC-BGM solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (reduced

to density functional theory at the level of an independent electron model) are presented

here for collisions of multi-charged ions (bare charges Q = 1, 2, 3) from atoms that form

constituents of the biologically relevant molecules, i.e., (H, C, N, O, P). The case of proton

projectiles was treated explicitly in Ref. [11], so those results are not repeated here. The

TC-BGM is implemented in projectile potential WP hierarchy which converges well and adds

123 pseudostates to span the complementary space (for all projectile and target combinations)

to the number of shells treated explicitly for target and projectile. For the target the

nT = 1, ..., 5 shells are included in all cases. For the projectile we include nP = 1, ..., 6 in the
case of He2+ projectiles and nP = 1, ..., 7 for Li3+. For ionization we observe a simple trend

for high collision energies, namely σC = σN = σO = 4σH = 2σP/3, as was found previously

for proton impact [11].

Pilot calculations were also carried out for Q = 6 projectiles in order to test the scaling

predictions. These TC-BGM ion-atom calculations for larger Q require order-of-magnitude

increases in computer time, since one has to take into account capture into shells with high

principal quantum numbers. This increase in demand on computer resources is one of the

primary motivations for the present work that involves the scaling of IAM-PCM data using

Q = 2, 3 projectiles, relating them to the Q = 1 calculations, and then extrapolating to

higher Q. Currently, there is access to experimental data for projectiles charges as high

as Q = 13 for uracil and water targets, and these data are used in the present work for

validation. Whether the extrapolations can be trusted to higher Q values remains to be seen

once more experimental data become available.

Fig. 1 displays the net ionization cross sections that form the ingredients for direct

7

application of the IAM-AR and IAM-PCM calculations described in the next subsection,

from which then a scaling model is derived and veriﬁed for ion-molecule collisions. The

results demonstrate the non-perturbative nature of these calculations which were obtained

using an exchange-only density functional (optimized potential) method for the target atoms

other than hydrogen.

While a detailed comparison of charge-state correlated cross sections would beneﬁt from

dynamical screening, the net ionization cross sections are deemed reliable from such a frozen-

potential approach for proton impact. For C4+ − Ne collisions at E = 20 keV/amu we found

in Ref. [37] that the total ionization cross sections are reduced by 25% when response is

included for both the target and projectile potentials. For higher energies the eﬀect is less

pronounced. It can be debated whether IAM-PCM can be based on atomic calculations

with response, and our current approach is that we use frozen-potential calculations even for

higher projectile charges.

The basic shapes of these cross sections roughly do not change with increasing projectile

charge Q, and there are diﬀerences in shape for the various target atoms. In the limit of

high energies we observe the known scaling with Q2, but in the vicinity of the maxima in

the cross sections this scaling factor is reduced. There is a small, but noticeable shift in the

position of the maxima as Q increases, and then at low collision energies ionization becomes

less eﬃcient with increasing projectile charge so that the net ionization cross sections become

comparable even though Q is increased. At even lower energies one can understand the

ineﬃciency of ionization by multiply charged projectiles not only as the competition with

capture channels, but also on the basis of (avoided) adiabatic energy level crossings. The

TC-BGM calculations are deemed capable of describing such behavior reasonably well. A

detailed comparison of shapes for Q = 2, 3 then shows a steepening of the rise in the cross

section starting from low E values.

The ion-atom collision cross section calculations are challenging and require signiﬁcant

computing resources. Comparison with the experimental data for atomic hydrogen is possible

(for He2+ and Li3+ projectiles the data are from Ref. [39, 40] and [41] respectively) The

comparison shows that converged theory is slightly higher than experiment. For p-H collisions

(cf. Fig. 6 in Ref. [11]) a similar situation arises. The agreement of our calculation with

the convergent close coupling approach (CCC) for He2+ impact [38] is as good as can be

expected from two complementary large-scale approaches.

FIG. 1. In the left panel the total (net) ionization cross sections for He2+ ions colliding with atoms

H, C, N, O, P is shown (solid lines) as calculated with the TC-BGM using basis sets described in

the text, while the right panel is for the case of Li3+ projectiles. The dashed lines indicate how in

the limit of high E the merging results for the heavier target atoms can be related to the values for

atomic hydrogen by using a scale factor. The He2+ − H results are compared with the convergent

close coupling calculation of Ref. [38], and the experimental data are from Ref. [39, 40] in this case,

and from Ref. [41] for Li3+ − H collisions.

The cross sections shown in Fig. 1 for Q = 2 and Q = 3 projectiles display a scaling

behavior (apparent by the log-log scaling of the axes), and it is this scaling which leads to

scaling for molecular targets when treated by the additivity rule, i.e., the IAM-AR approach.

This scaling behavior forms the starting point for the next section.

B. Scaling model for ion-molecule collisions

Fig. 2 forms the basis for the discussion. The empirical scaling models aim to capture the

essence of the data in the non-perturbative regime where the net ionization cross sections

have their maxima. The left panel of Fig. 2 displays the net ionization cross sections for the

two models, which have the following characteristics: (i) with increasing projectile charge

The left panel shows the total (net) ionization cross sections produced from uracil

(C4H4N2O2) by charged-ion impact for Q = 1, 2, 3 as calculated in the IAM-PCM (solid lines), and

in the IAM-AR (dashed lines). In the left panel Q = 1 appears at the bottom and Q = 3 at the top.

The middle panel shows a scaled net ionization cross section for the IAM-AR model (dashed lines

falling onto a single curve to within 5 % for E > 20 keV/amu), and the the IAM-PCM calculations

which do not obey this scaling behavior in the energy range shown (here Q = 1 appears at the top,

while Q = 3 is at the bottom). The right panel shows a scaled net ionization cross section that

works for the IAM-PCM (solid lines agreeing to within 5 % in a range enclosing the maximum, i.e.,

for 30 ≤ E ≤ 500 keV/amu), while the IAM-AR results show Q = 3 at the top and Q = 1 at the

bottom.

Q = 1, 2, 3 the diﬀerence between IAM-PCM (solid lines) and IAM-AR (dashed lines) results

grows dramatically. This is caused by the increase in the atomic cross sections with projectile

charge Q (except at the lowest collision energies) and thus an increase in the overlap eﬀect

which the IAM-PCM takes into account; (ii) the position of the maxima in these cross

sections changes very similarly with Q for the two models, which implies that a common

energy scaling can be applied, particularly if one is interested in scaling the cross sections in

the vicinity of the maximum.

IAM-PCMIAM-ARQ=1Q=2Q=3IAM-PCMIAM-ARQ=1Q=2Q=3IAM-PCMIAM-ARQ=1Q=2Q=3For the IAM-AR (middle panel of Fig. 2) the energy scaling for the maximum implies

that it is useful to introduce

E(cid:48) = E Q−2/3

(1)

in order to ﬁnd a common curve, and that the net cross sections should be scaled in accord

with

Q=1(E(cid:48)) = σAR
σAR

(2)

in order to obtain a single universal curve for σAR

through the scaled energy E(cid:48). Here σAR

Q=1(E(cid:48)) where the only Q-dependence is
Q (E) is the IAM-AR net ionization cross section for a

projectile with charge Q and energy E colliding with the molecule.

In the right panel of Fig. 2 the IAM-PCM data are presented while applying the same

energy scaling. Since in the vicinity of the maximum the IAM-PCM cross section grows

diﬀerently with Q than the IAM-AR result quite a diﬀerent scaling factor is needed: Q−0.75

vs Q−4/3. We then arrive at

Q=1 (E(cid:48)) = σPCM
σPCM

Q

(E) Q−0.75 .

(3)

If the scaling works the reduced cross sections σAR

Q=1 (E(cid:48)) must correspond
to the calculated cross sections for proton impact at energy E(cid:48). The IAM-PCM and IAM-AR

Q=1(E(cid:48)) and σPCM

results merge in the limit of high E(cid:48), since the atomic cross sections become small in this

limit, such that the geometric overlap eﬀect disappears. We note that others have made

attempts at scaling ion-molecule cross sections using classical-trajectory calculations [35] or

distorted-wave models [14, 15], and these attempts have so far not led to an understanding

of scaling in the regime of the cross section maxima, but have focused on the high-energy

behavior.

The present calculations obey the following behavior in the limit of high energies: the

IAM-PCM goes over into the IAM-AR in this limit because the cross sections become small.

Where exactly this occurs depends on the value of the projectile charge Q. The left panel of

Fig. 2 indicates that for protons this merge happens at about E = 2000 keV/amu, and at

substantially higher energies for Q > 1 to the point where for these higher projectile charges

the overlapping eﬀect contained in the IAM-PCM cannot be ignored in the regime of interest

(below 10 MeV/amu).

The scaling behavior of the IAM-AR is compatible with the behavior known for the

ion-atom cross sections, i.e., the Bethe-Born limit which is obeyed by the TC-BGM calcula-

11

tions [10, 11]. Since this limit applies to proton-atom collisions we can argue that for any

molecular target the IAM-AR net ionization cross section for a projectile of charge Q obeys

Q (E) → Q4/3 A ln E(cid:48) + B

(4)

and therefore is proportional to the square of the projectile charge.

The right panel of Fig. 2 displays an interesting phenomenon: while the IAM-PCM results

do go over into the corresponding IAM-AR ones at the highest collision energies there is

a cross-over phenomenon connected with the shape change. While the IAM-PCM result

for protons merges with the IAM-AR result smoothly, for the cases of Q = 2 (green) and

Q = 3 (red) we ﬁnd extended regions around E = 1 MeV/amu with a characteristic slope

that is not as steep as the perturbative high-E result. This will turn out to be of even bigger

importance discussed below in the context of Q = 4 − 8 projectiles at E = 1 − 6 MeV/amu.

At high energies the IAM-PCM scaling expression (3) (which captures the behavior near the

maximum in the cross section) is replaced by the IAM-AR scaling, which is also obeyed by

the IAM-PCM in this limit. A parametrization is introduced to switch from the IAM-PCM

form of scaling which works at intermediate energies E to the IAM-AR scaling in order to

construct a scaling formula for the IAM-PCM results that is valid at all energies.

Now that we understand the scaling behavior of the IAM-PCM cross sections we proceed

with developing a parametrization that will allow to predict cross sections for collisions

with higher projectile charges Q, for which the computation of ion-atom collisions using

the TC-BGM becomes very challenging. The idea is to ﬁnd a parametrization that allows

to derive Q-fold charged projectile collisions from molecules on the basis of proton-impact

collisions (at scaled energies), conﬁrm its validity for Q = 2, 3 and then compare with

experiment which is available for Q = 4..8. We can expect such empirical scaling to work at

energies E > 40 keV/amu on the basis of the data shown in the right panel of Fig. 2. The

scaling of the IAM-PCM cross section maxima with Q0.75 is an empirical result for uracil. In

general, we assume scaling with Qβ, with the implication that β = 0.75 for uracil and that it

can have diﬀerent values for other molecules where the cross sectional area overlap eﬀects

are diﬀerent.

In order to accommodate the change in behavior which is apparent in the right panel

of Fig. 2 we parametrize the representation of the IAM-PCM cross section by a switching

function which keeps the IAM-PCM scaling in the vicinity of the maximum, but then with

12

increasing collision energy shifts over to the known IAM-AR scaling of the cross sections.

This is not an attempt to modify the IAM-PCM result, however, it is just a convenient way

to represent it making use of both scaling regimes obeyed by the IAM-PCM calculations.

The switching function is deﬁned as

(cid:34)

a(E) =

1 +

(cid:18) E/E0
Q − 1

(cid:19) 4√

Q

(cid:35)−1

,

(5)

with the switching point chosen as E0 = 2000 keV/amu and Q ≥ 2. Note that the case of

anti-proton impact (Q = −1) is explicitly excluded. While in the high-E limit ionization by

protons and anti-protons does yield the same amount of net ionization, the physics is very

diﬀerent in the vicinity of the cross section maximum (saddle-mechanism for positively charged

projectiles, pushing charge out of the way for anti-proton impact). The parametrization of

the IAM-PCM net ionization cross section scaling now takes the form

σPCM
Q

(E) = a(E)QβσPCM

Q=1 (E(cid:48)) + (1 − a(E))Q4/3σAR

Q=1(E(cid:48)) .

(6)

This parametrization of the IAM-PCM cross sections for Q-fold charged ion impact in terms

of the proton-impact cross sections evaluated at E(cid:48) depends on a single parameter β whose

value is connected with the ‘density’ of independent atoms, and which needs to be determined

by tracking the movement of the maxima with charge in the IAM-PCM cross sections. A

discussion of detailed results for the uracil target (for which β = 0.75 was shown to work)

follows, and a table of values of β for other molecules is given further below.

We emphasize that the role of the interpolation scheme (6) is to provide the scaling

description of the IAM-PCM results. The appearance of the IAM-AR cross section in (6)

follows from the construction and is natural (IAM-PCM goes over into IAM-AR in this

perturbative limit). We also note that the choice of interpolating form (5) for a(E) is not

unique, but that we can demonstrate that it works at the few-percent level of accuracy.

In Fig. 3 the eﬀectiveness of the parametrization for energies E > 40 keV/amu is

demonstrated. The IAM-AR results are reproduced by the simple scaling law, as suggested

by data shown in the middle panel of Fig. 2. The IAM-PCM scaling results (crosses) track

the data well around the maxima in the cross sections, but show some weakness at low

energies (E < 40 keV/amu) for reasons discussed before. Ionization by highly charged ions

becomes ineﬀective at low energies as one moves towards the quasi-molecular regime and

due to increasing competition from capture channels.

section at energies of scale E0 = 2000 keV/amu it is possible to simplify the parametrization

and eliminate the IAM-AR cross section σAR

the fact that the switching function (5) deviates signiﬁcantly from unity only at very high

the water molecule target in Fig. 4 for which the β parameter is larger than for uracil. We

begin by noting that the p − H2O IAM-PCM cross sections have been corrected compared

to our previous work [9, 10] in that the correct bond length has been implemented here.

We have also tested the IAM-PCM calculated cross sections against an exact geometric

calculation of the overlapping circular areas which is possible for a triatomic molecule, and

found that the IAM-PCM implementation matches the geometric calculation to excellent

precision.

As a consequence of the corrected bond length error the IAM-PCM net ionization cross

section now is further reduced around the maximum as compared to the IAM-AR calculation,

and the IAM-PCM and IAM-AR results now merge only at an energy of E = 1000 keV/amu.

We also veriﬁed that H2O was the only target molecule for which a bond length error

happened (it was an angstrom vs atomic unit problem, and the previously made error is

apparent in Figs. 2a and 3a of Ref. [10]).

Concerning the comparison of scaling behavior for uracil (β = 0.75) and water (β = 1.1),

i.e., comparing Fig. 3 to Fig. 4 we can provide the following comments. In the case of water

the larger β-parameter value implies that the feature associated with the maximum in the

net proton-molecule collision (for which IAM-PCM, i.e., atomic cross sectional area overlap is

giving the strongest eﬀect) acquires a higher scaling with Q. The progression of cross section

values at maximum is (in units of Å2) {4.6, 10, 15} for Q = {1, 2, 3}. For the uracil target the

corresponding progression is {19, 32, 44}. The decrease of the β value with the complexity of

the molecule is connected with the fact that overlap eﬀects become more important with the

growing number of atoms and the IAM-PCM takes this into account.

III. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

A. Collisions with uracil (C4H4N2O2)

Total ionization cross section measurements for uracil targets have a bit of a history.

Net ionization can be obtained by collecting all electrons produced during the collision, a

measurement process know from ion-atom collisions [42] (called σ−), but that is not how

all the data were obtained. Time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy was used to determine the

16

fragment yields, and some analysis went into ﬁnding the fragment distributions following

electron capture versus direct ionization [43] for proton impact at velocities that match those

of the valence electrons (20-150 keV/amu). Doubly charged uracil is not observed, so it

is likely to fragment before the mass analysis as observed by coincidence spectroscopy of

fragments [4]. This must also be the case for higher-projectile charge impact, such as C4+

and O6+ [2, 3], where doubly-charged uracil is absent from the mass spectra. Tabet et al. [44]

found very large values for the direct ionization and capture cross sections in this energy

range, for E = 80 keV proton impact direct ionization is reported to reach 177 ± 35 Å2. Itoh

et al. [7] determined absolute diﬀerential cross sections at higher energies by detecting the

electron yield and by comparing with calculations, they demonstrated that the high cross

section value of Ref.[44] was in conﬂict with their ﬁndings for σ−.

The heavy ion measurements in the same velocity regime [2, 3] were normalized by using

features in the diﬀerential electron emission: KLL Auger lines from the constituent atoms C,

N, O were observed. Absolute normalization at a high energy (3.5 MeV/amu) was obtained

with an uncertainty estimated at ±20%, and relative uncertainties for the data were assessed

at ±12%. The total cross sections were obtained by measuring the fragment yields with some

uncertainty coming from N+

2 contributions from collisions with the background gas. Unlike
the proton impact measurements of Ref. [44], however the projectile charge state after the

collision was not determined. To ensure a proper separation from ionization and fragment

production by pure capture processes coincidence with an ejected electron was imposed. This

procedure includes electron production from transfer ionization processes, but if one then

adds up all charged fragments one overestimates the contribution from transfer ionization

to net ionization (by a factor of two for the process where one electron is captured, and

one transferred to the continuum, and by more for higher-order capture plus higher-order

ionization). At the higher velocities (v = 7 − 15 Bohr units) this problem does not exist,

since capture plays a small role (except for capture from innermost shells, but these are small

contributions).

We now confront the predictions from the IAM-PCM scaling model which was established

on the basis of Q = 2, 3 calculations with experimental and theoretical data for higher

projectile charges Q = 4, 6 for which experimental data exist both below the predicted

maximum and above [2]. The comparison provided in Fig. 5 reveals the following: at the

high-energy end, i.e., for E > 1000keV/amu the scaled IAM-PCM cross section does agree

17

with the experimental data for both projectile charges almost within error bars, but shows a

somewhat diﬀerent energy dependence. The energy dependence of the experimental data

follows the trend given by CTMC, CB1 (ﬁrst Born model with correct boundary condition),

and CDW-EIS in this regime, although these theories yield higher cross section values. We

note that both projectiles do have fully populated K-shells, i.e., we do not expect major

anomalies in the cross sections from Auger processes.

At the lower end of collision energies, below E = 100 keV/amu we ﬁnd the comparison

to be more complicated. For the case of Q = 4 the present results join the two regimes of

experimental data reasonably well, but fall short at the lower end where the observed scaling

behavior becomes less accurate as discussed in Section II B. All other theories than scaled

IAM-PCM provide estimates higher by at least a factor of four, with CDW-EIS doing better,

but showing an energy dependence that diﬀers from the experimental and from the scaled

IAM-PCM data trends. Clearly, the situation calls for experiments to map out the location

of the maximum in the net ionization cross section.

The comparison with the case of Q = 6 seems to warrant a diﬀerent conclusion: the

experimental data are consistently higher than the scaled IAM-PCM results by a factor of

two in the regime to the left of the maximum in the IAM-PCM data. The experimental data

trend is supported by the CTMC calculation, which however failed in the case of Q = 4.

Again, we call for experiments in the regime that connects the low-E and high-E data shown

in Fig. 5. As explained at the beginning of the subsection the low-energy data in Ref. [2] may

be aﬀected by over-counting of transfer ionization contributions, and this may be a bigger

problem for the system with the higher projectile charge, but we have no further support

from calculations to make this case. Therefore, the scaling of the net ionization cross section

with Q for impact velocities that match the valence shell orbital speeds remains a mystery.

Another non-perturbative calculation that could be trusted in this regime, the CTMC

calculation of Ref. [45] matches the Q = 6 experimental data (right panel) at low energies,

then joins the CDW-EIS result which is a factor of two above the high-energy data. For

Q = 4 (left panel) this calculation overestimates the data over the entire energy range,

and still matches the CDW-EIS calculation at high E. The comparison with the CTMC

calculation is interesting, since (as explained in Ref. [46]) the calculation makes use of an

eﬀective multi-center potential that matches quantum chemistry calculations, uses molecular

orbital energies, and performs random molecular orientation sampling.

calculations respectively obtained by scaling the proton impact cross sections. The experimental

data (diamonds with error bars) are for C4+ projectiles (left panel) and for O6+ projectiles (right

short-dashed red line, which is the highest curve), and from distorted wave theory CDW-EIS as a

purple dash-dotted line (the latter two from Ref. [2]).

In Fig. 6 we present a comparison with many available experimental ion-uracil ionization

cross sections at high impact energies in order to explore how the data scale. The most

striking feature is the diﬀerence in the energy dependence between the case of Q = 1 and the

higher projectile charges in the IAM-PCM. While the proton impact data are described well

by both our results and the CDW-EIS model [14], the latter retains the energy dependence for

the higher charges Q. The diﬀerence in the energy dependence between Q = 1 and the higher

projectile charges for IAM-PCM is a consequence of the overlap eﬀect when the eﬀective

projectiles with charges Q = 1 (Ref. [7]) and Q = 4 − 8 (Ref. [2, 3]) are compared to the present

IAM-PCM results. The ordering of results is such that higher projectile charges Q result in higher

cross sections. The proton impact data are multiplied by a factor of four for comparison purposes

and are shown in grey. The highly charged projectiles are distinguished by color (red, blue, green,

magenta, black) for Q = 4 − 8 respectively, and the projectile ions C, O, F are represented by

diamonds, triangles and squares respectively. For clarity the experimental data are shown without

uncertainties which are estimated to be ±25% for the Q ≥ 4 data.

cross sectional area is computed: with increasing cross sections the areas representing the

individual atoms increase, thereby causing more overlap. Thus, we observe that while in

the proton impact case the dependence still follows somewhat the proton-atom cross section

energy dependence, a turnover happens between Q = 1 and Q = 4 in the IAM-PCM results.

20

Q=1*4Q=4Q=5Q=6Q=7Q=8H+CQ+OQ+FQ+Note that all Q > 1 cross sections can be obtained simply from Eq. (7) based on the input for

IAM-PCM which are given in Table A1 of Ref. [11]. The slightly more accurate data based

on Eq. (6) require the IAM-AR cross sections which can be assembled from ion-atom cross

sections (there is no orientation dependence in this IAM, very much like in the CDW-EIS

based calculations used, e.g., in Ref. [14, 15]). Proton-atom cross sections that are input to

our IAM-AR result can be read oﬀ Fig. 6 in Ref. [11].

How well do the IAM-PCM results compare to the experimental data? Given that absolute

normalization of ionization cross sections is a challenging task the error estimates of the data

(±25%) are dominated by the normalization procedure. For some of the data the slope of the

IAM-PCM results matches experiment, particularly for O5+ and C4+ projectiles over a wide

range of energies. At the highest energies measured the experimental data are sharply lower

which does not help with the assessment as to whether the data follow the present IAM-PCM

trend or not. Concerning the Q dependence of the magnitude of the cross sections we observe

that IAM-PCM matches the experimental data reasonably well, while the CDW-EIS and

CTMC models show serious discrepancies, which is highlighted in greater detail in Fig. 8

below.

We now use the scaling behavior found on the basis of explicit IAM-PCM calculations

for Q = 1, 2, 3 (with some conﬁrmation from Q = 6, which is not shown) to extract a

reduced Q = 1 cross section from the experimental data for Q = 4 − 8, and compare the

result with the IAM-PCM Q = 1 cross section, and show the IAM-AR Q = 1 result for

reference, as well. Fig 7 reveals a few rather interesting facts: the proton impact data at

E = {0.5, 1.0, 2.0} MeV span the entire range of high-energy data from Ref. [2], namely 1 to

6 MeV/amu. A good part of the high-energy Q = 4 − 8 experimental data is mapped into a

band more or less between the IAM-PCM and IAM-AR Q = 1 cross sections, but the highest

points near E(cid:48) = 2 MeV/amu (from C4+ and C5+) fall below. Data which would cover the

E(cid:48) = 50 − 400 keV/amu would be most welcome in order to settle the question whether the

IAM-PCM prediction (solid line, which appears to work for C4+ projectiles, but not for the

case of O6+) is indeed correct. Proton impact data below E = 500 keV/amu would also be

most welcome.

In order to provide more clarity concerning the comparison between theories and experiment

at high energies we show in Fig. 8 the data separated by projectile charge using a semi-

logarithmic representation. This ﬁgure establishes how well the experimental data are

reproduced on an absolute scale by the IAM-PCM, and how far they are from the IAM-AR

scaling, which matches the behavior of the CDW-EIS and CTMC theories. The ﬁgure also

demonstrates how the data really do depend on the charge state Q with very little dependence

on the nuclear charge of the projectile. Some experimental data appear to deviate from the

IAM-PCM results at high energies (as commented upon before), notably for C5+, but no

such deviation is visible in the same energy range for O7+. It remains an open question

In Fig. 9 the IAM-PCM data for proton impact, and the scaled IAM-PCM data for higher

Q are compared to available measurements. The proton impact data (shown as a black

curve) which form the input for the scaled cross sections are consistent in shape with the

three available sets of measurements [17–20] for impact energies E > 30 keV/amu. They

agree very well in magnitude with the data of Luna et al [20], and are a bit lower than the

other data.

For smaller energies E < 30 keV they do not follow the experimental data but drop

faster as E decreases - a property they share with another non-perturbative, albeit classical

calculation [33]. At these lower energies the IAM cross sections drop not only more rapidly

than the experimental data, but also than TC-BGM ion-molecule calculations [27], and even

more so than the molecular-orbital based semiclassical calculation of Ref. [32], which exceeds

the experimental data in this range. One may draw the conclusion that molecular eﬀects

due to the orbital energy level structure are unlikely to be captured by an IAM.

The scaled IAM-PCM net ionization cross sections for Q = 2 (shown in blue) display

a similar behavior, and fall below the experimental data for He2+ more markedly for E <

80 keV/amu. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the position of the maximum in the cross

section agrees well. Again, the TC-BGM ion-molecule calculation [30] does not suﬀer from

this drop at low E. At the highest energies the IAM-PCM results match very well with the

two measured points of Ref. [48].

For Q = 3 (shown in green) there is agreement with the Li3+ experimental data con-

cerning the magnitude of the cross section for for E > 80 keV/amu, while the shape of the

experimental data pattern diﬀers somewhat from the scaled IAM-PCM results. The fact that

the experimental data for He2+ and Li3+ projectiles show such similar magnitudes cannot be

explained with scaling behavior, and should be resolved by further experimentation. At the

lowest energies the experiments of Luna et al [21] may suﬀer from a shortfall due to transfer

ionization processes yielding two protons as fragments (only one of them would be detected).

For higher-Q projectiles comparison with the experimental data for C6+ [24, 25, 49],

O8+ [23, 25], and Si13+ [24] is very satisfactory with some tension with the O8+ data. Overall

we ﬁnd that the proposed IAM-PCM scaling with projectile charge and energy works well

for the water molecule target and is strongly supported by experiment for medium to high

energies. Note that for Q ≥ 3 the IAM-PCM (and experimental) data have not yet reached

the Q2-proportional scaling of the Bethe-Born limit at the right end of Fig. 9.

In Fig. 10 the IAM-PCM scaling behavior of Eq. (7) is tested and compared against the

IAM-PCM calculation for Q = 1, while the IAM-AR result is provided for reference. As was

the case for the uracil target (Fig. 7) the experimental data at high energies show scatter,

but follow the trend well - especially since there are discrepancies for diﬀerent data taken for

identical projectiles. At energies below 200 keV/amu the two IAM results separate as one

approaches the maximum. The Li3+ impact data [21] which were compared against TC-BGM

ion-molecule calculations (and which are also compared with in the recent CTMC mean-ﬁeld

model work of Ref. [36]) provide some support for the proposed scaling. At energies below

respectively. The experimental data are from the sources cited with Fig. 9 and share the symbol

patterns, but uncertainties are omitted here.

E(cid:48) < 50 keV/amu one may want to be critical of the IAM approach and of CTMC, since

these models cannot describe the molecular eﬀects associated with the electronic structure of

the particular molecule in question. At higher energies one can think of IAM-AR results as

representing an upper bound to the reduced cross section, while IAM-PCM may be on the

low side, since the eﬀect of the overlapping cross sectional areas does reduce the contributions

from certain multiple processes, namely those associated with separate constituent atoms.

The reduction of multiple electron contributions may be viewed as somewhat similar to

what is contained in the dynamical mean-ﬁeld CTMC model [36], which in contrast to the

frozen-potential CTMC calculations shows comparable behavior to what we ﬁnd in the

IAM-PCM results.

We have presented new basis generator method calculations for scattering of projectile ions

with charges Q = 2, 3 from fundamental atoms that are the building blocks for biologically

relevant molecules. The calculated net ionization cross sections were then used to compute

independent atom model cross sections for molecular targets using both the simple additivity

rule (IAM-AR, which should represent the correct high-energy limit) and an independent

atom model that is based on the idea that the projectiles only experience the overlap of

atomic cross sections taken as geometric areas (carried out by a pixel counting method or

PCM). The scaling behavior of the IAM-AR and IAM-PCM results is established, and a

parametrization is presented that is capable of reproducing the computed IAM-PCM net

ionization cross sections in terms of the proton-molecule IAM-PCM and IAM-AR results. To

a good approximation this can also be obtained in terms of the IAM-PCM proton-molecule

cross section alone. These scaled results are then compared to experimental data for two

targets, namely uracil and water vapor. While the agreement is not perfect, a number of

trends are reproduced better than by any other theory applied previously to the problem.

The theoretical scaling model was used to compute reduced Q = 1 cross sections from Q ≥ 2

experimental data for uracil and water and then compared to the proton impact case. We

also pointed out a few inconsistencies in the experimental data - this fact implies that further

experiments are needed. For the uracil target, in particular, systematic measurements for at

least Q = 1, 2 in the tens of keV/amu energy range would help to establish the entire domain

where the scaling model applies in nature. Such investigations together with the presented

results will pave the way towards reliable simulations for cancer therapy with highly charged

ions.
