to study the physics of charged particles in magnetic fields in 
a hybrid, i.e. digitally enhanced, lab environment. 

𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐 and 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 are measured with multimeters and gath-
ered by a USB-connected single board computer [cf. Fig. 1], 
which in turn establishes a wireless data link to the Ho-
loLens. On the HoloLens’ semi-transparent display the real-
time measurement data is presented as numerical values in 
real time [cf. Fig. 2]. In order to determine the radius of the 
electron beam, we have added a virtual ruler that can by ges-
ture control both be moved in depth to the plane of the elec-
tron beam and adjusted to the diameter of the circular beam 
path [cf. Fig. 2].

Since the emergence of Augmented Reality (AR), it has been 
a constant subject of educational research, as it can improve 
conceptual understanding and generally promote learning 
[1]. In addition, a motivational effect and improved interac-
tion and collaboration through AR were observed [2]. Re-
cently, AR technologies have taken a major leap forward in 
development, such that especially head-mounted devices or 
smartglasses came in question for supporting experimenta-
tion in STEM education [3,4]. In line with these develop-
ments, we here present an AR experiment in electrodynamics 
for undergraduate laboratory courses in physics using real-
time physical data from and virtual tools on mobile devices 
to both analyze and visualize physical phenomena.  

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 

In order to determine the electron charge-to-mass ratio 
−𝑒/𝑚𝑒 a fine beam tube is typically used in educational set-
tings. Its main part is an electron gun that generates electrons 
by thermal glow emission, accelerates them due to a voltage 
𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐 between anode and cathode and bundles them into a fo-
cused beam. The electron gun is embedded into an evacuated 
glass sphere back-filled with hydrogen or helium at low-pres-
sure. Hence, the electron beam becomes visible due to impact 
ionization. This fine beam tube is mounted on a stand right in 
the middle of a Helmholtz coil pair, where a coil current 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 
generates an almost homogenous magnetic field. Provided 
𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 is large enough compared to 𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐, the resulting Lorentz 
force deflects the electrons onto a circular path within the 
glass sphere. The Lorentz force acting on an electron with ve-
locity 𝑣⃗𝑒 in a magnetic field 𝐵⃗⃗ is given by 
𝐹⃗ = −𝑒 (𝑣⃗𝑒 × 𝐵⃗⃗) . 
For an ideal homogenous magnetic field and the electron ve-
locity being perpendicular to the magnetic field, the Lorentz 
force acts as radial force, that is,

= −𝑒 ⋅ 𝑣𝑒 ⋅ 𝐵 

according to amount and with 𝑟 representing the radius of the 
circular electron path. Using the relations between 𝑣𝑒 and 
𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐 respectively between 𝐵 and 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 the essential propor-
tionality in this experiment is given by

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

In the experiment students use the Microsoft HoloLens 
[5] as AR smartglasses both to record measurement data and

All numerical values that are needed to calculate the 
charge-to-mass ratio are shown on the display of the smart-
glasses. By “air tapping” a single record button (out of the 
field of view in Fig. 2), all three values are automatically 
added to a CSV file that can be analysed after the experi-
ment. Additional measurements are recorded either for differ-
ent voltages and coil currents measuring the altered diameter 
again, or by adjusting 𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐 and 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 such that the diameter 
keeps constant. Especially in the latter case, a measurement 
series can be done both rather quickly and by a single stu-
dent, if wanted or necessary.

tion, the theoretically predicted electron beam is augmented. 

In addition to the hybrid measurement possibility we im-

plemented a visualization of the magnetic field [cf. Fig. 3] 
according to the current experimental parameters. The user 
can also overlay the corresponding theoretically predicted 
electron beam. All field and beam data is calculated in ad-
vance by the finite-element method for a relevant parameter 
space of 𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐 and 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 with a sufficiently narrow parameter 
grid. In between these points on the grid the AR applications 
interpolates the pre-calculated field and beam data linearly 
and visualizes it on the smartglasses accordingly. Moreover, 
the relevant formulas for Lorentz force, field strength as 
function of 𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙 and electron velocity as function of 𝑈𝑎𝑐𝑐 can 
be enabled as overlay to the experiment (not shown here). 
The parameter(s) currently being changed in the experiment 
are then highlighted by color in the formulas. 

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

= −(1.76 ± 0.01) ⋅ 1011 C ⋅ kg−1, which is remark-

We recorded a series of N=18 measurements with con-
stant radius but different acceleration voltages and coil cur-
rents in the AR environment. As a mean value we obtained 
− 𝑒 𝑚𝑒⁄
ably close to the CODATA value [6] −1.758820024(11) ⋅
1011 C ⋅ kg−1. In several manual measurement series, visu-
ally reading off the values, we best reached an accuracy of 
only about 3%. We relate the improved accuracy in the AR 
environment to the following two factors: One the one hand, 
even the stabilized power and voltage supplies we used vary 
over time. As an effect, one or both values read off may dif-
fer a little from the ones immediately after calibration to the 

constant radius. This error source is reduced in our AR meas-
urement, where both values are recorded simultaneously right 
after calibration. On the other hand, visually reading off the 
diameter includes a parallax error, as the measuring device 
lies approximately 9 cm in front of the electron beam. This 
error can be reduced by using a mirror on the backside of the 
glass sphere but it is still not as accurate as the virtual ruler in 
our AR environment, which can be placed directly in the 
plane of the electron beam in the glass sphere.  

The only drawback we experienced in using the AR envi-
ronment for this specific experiment is the need to adjust the 
light conditions so that both the weakly glowing electron 
beam is clearly visible through the darkening HoloLens and 
one can still see enough to operate the power supplies. 

CONCLUSION 

We implemented an augmented lab experiment for the 
fine beam tube using AR smartglasses. All measurements in 
order to determine the specific charge can be recorded digi-
tally in the AR environment. With this AR-based approach 
we observe several advantages: First, the measured values 
seem to be more accurate compared to reading them off visu-
ally. Second, acquisition of measurement values is easy and 
quick and can easily be done alone. Finally and probably 
most important, the additional field visualization coupled to 
real-time data provides an immediate feedback to the stu-
dents’ experimental actions. In combination with correspond-
ing mathematical formulas of a theoretical description in a 
single hybrid learning environment we expect this to foster 
understanding relationships between theory and experiment 
as found in comparable AR experiments [4] since it provides 
high temporal and spatial contiguity thereby avoiding a split-
attention effect [7].
