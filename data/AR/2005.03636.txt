Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) operated at high pressure have become a topic of
interest for future long baseline neutrino experiments. Pressurized gas retains the low momentum
threshold for particle detection of atmospheric TPCs, but oﬀers a larger target mass for neutrino
interactions at the same volume. Operation at high pressure poses several new challenges in
safety aspects regarding overpressure and high voltage safety. The presented High Pressure Gas
Monitoring Chamber (HPGMC) can be used to study the suitability of various drift gas mixtures
up to 10 bar and a maximum ﬁeld of ∼ 3000 V/cm. A ﬂexible construction makes it possible to
exchange parts of the inner detector and to test new technologies. In this work, the construction of
a HPGMC and its commissioning using the P10 gas mixture (90 % Ar + 10 % CH4) are presented.

Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are gaseous detectors that have originally been conceived for
tracking moderate numbers of particles in clean lepton interactions at colliders [1]. Since then, the
TPC technology has evolved and is presently employed from rare event searches [2] to ultra-high
multiplicities nuclear collision experiments [3]. The gas is interchangeable and can be tailored to
the given task without modiﬁcation of the main detector parts. Since the active medium is of very
low density, a low momentum, below 200 MeV/𝑐 for protons, threshold for track reconstruction can
be achieved. Hence, TPCs have become a topic of interest for experiments at the few GeV energy
scale, where the range of particles limits resolution, e.g. for separation of tracks at an interaction
vertex.

Currently, the modelling of nuclear eﬀects in ﬁnal state interactions are the limiting systematic
uncertainties of long baseline neutrino experiments [4]. It can be improved by new data in the low
momentum region [5]. To achieve a higher target mass, while retaining a low momentum threshold,
High Pressure Time Projections Chambers (HPTPC) have been proposed for future experiments.
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment’s (DUNE) near detector complex foresees to build a
10 bar HPTPC to constrain interaction uncertainties in combination with the liquid argon ﬁlled far
detectors [6, 7]. This work presents the construction and commissioning of a small-scale gaseous
detector aimed at studies of electron drift parameters at high pressures.

2 Gas Monitoring Chambers

The characteristics of the TPC’s drift gas are a necessary input for the initial design and for
reconstruction in a running detector. Any change of drift gas properties will aﬀect performance.
Some TPCs have life times in excess of 10 years under constantly changing environmental conditions
(T, p) and gas quality. Hence, continuous calibration of electron drift properties is needed to mitigate
mid to long term deviations from design values. Gas Monitoring Chamber (GMC) detectors have
been used for that purpose by many experiments, including L3 [8], OPAL [9], CMS [10] and
T2K [11].

2.1 Working Principle

A GMC is a miniature TPC where ionization tracks are created at known positions by radioactive
sources (90Sr). Emitted 𝛽-electrons can traverse the drift volume inside a ﬁeld cage, leaving a
track of liberated electrons and ions, and exit into a scintillating ﬁbre, see ﬁgure 1a. The light
signal created in the scintillating ﬁbres is used to start a ﬁxed time window readout of signals from
avalanche-multiplied electrons recorded at the GMC’s anode. Figure 1b shows the average of 1000
recorded waveforms without distinguishing between the two (near and far) source positions. The
drift velocity 𝑣d is then calculated from the time diﬀerence Δ𝑡 between the two signal peaks and the
known distance Δ𝑧 between near and far source locations:

𝑣d =

Δ𝑧
Δ𝑡

(2.1)

In this scheme, the drift velocity is eﬀectively measured between the source positions in a central
drift region of the GMC. This reduces or removes major systematic eﬀects from the measurement.
The central ﬁeld cage region has a more homogeneous drift ﬁeld than at the edges of the chambers,
close to the ﬁeld cage walls. In addition, drift velocity deviations from strong fringe ﬁelds close to
the anode cancel out. Furthermore, constant-time response delays of the readout, i.e. from cables
and trigger electronics, are removed, because only time diﬀerences enter in [Eq. 2.1].

GMCs have also been equipped with mono-energetic X-ray sources to monitor gas gain. By
continuous measurement of the spectrum of 55Fe, deviations in the gas gain can be monitored and
calibrated for or corrected [11]. Owing to the small gas volumes of GMCs of ∼ 1ℓ to 5ℓ, gas can
quickly be replaced without loosing much time or gas for ﬂushing. This feature has been exploited
to monitor multiple sub-detectors in sequence [10].

2.2 Continuous Calibrations

Drifting electrons are accelerated and deﬂected by electric and magnetic ﬁelds between collisions
with the gas atoms or molecules. The rate at which these collisions take place depends on the gas
density and follows pressure and temperature ﬂuctuations. The drift velocity then only depends on
the ratio of the electric ﬁeld and gas density [12]. It is routinely corrected for by evaluating gas
properties at the scaled electric ﬁeld E∗:

𝑣d(E∗) = 𝑣d

The quantity E∗ is often referred to as the reduced electric ﬁeld.

ﬁeld cage has a length of ∼ 97 mm, an inner diameter of ∼ 77 mm and the sources are separated by
Δ𝑧 = 51.95 mm. Applied drift ﬁelds can mirror that of a host TPC or systematically scan through
diﬀerent ﬁelds to create a drift velocity curve. (b) Average over 1000 waveforms recorded at the
anode taken in P10 (90 % Ar + 10 % CH4) at 1.5 bar and with the HPGMC. The time diﬀerence of
the two peaks is the drift time between the near and far source’s position.

TPCs are often not well controlled in pressure or temperature, but follow environmental
ﬂuctuations [11]. As a result, the drift properties of the used gas mixture vary over time, and have
to be accounted for when reconstructing particle tracks or combining data sets over long running
periods. One strategy used is to operate a GMC in parallel to a main detector TPC with gas supplied
by the detector’s return line and identical electric ﬁeld [11]. Temperature and pressure of the gas in
the TPC and GMC are recorded. Both data sets can be calibrated towards a common 𝑇0 and 𝑝0 to
make the data comparable over the runtime by correcting changes in gas density. Changes through
varying gas quality and ageing to some extent are picked up and calibrated for by this strategy. For
the T2K near detector ND280, the gas gain ﬂuctuations are reduced to 1 % compared to ∼ 10 %
without calibration [11]. The remaining ﬂuctuations are thought to be caused by other inﬂuences
on the gas gain, such as the mixing stability [5].

3 High Pressure Operation

The operation principle of an atmospheric GMC can be transferred almost identically to a High
Pressure Gas Monitoring Chamber (HPGMC). The target pressure is taken to be 10 bar, following
the design of the DUNE near detector [7].

Many commonly used quenching gases are ﬂammable, adding another source of danger to high
overpressure. To ensure safe operation, the critical parts are sourced from industry with certiﬁed
and veriﬁed quality. Pressure-holding parts are manufactured according to DIN standard, which
restricts the vessel’s capacity to a maximum of 50 bar ℓ, or 5 ℓ at 10 bar [13]. A small inner volume

– 3 –

is also desirable to provide a frequent exchange of the gas inside and thus low latency detection of
changes in the gas mixture composition or quality (Section 2.1).

3.1 Range of Electrons in High Pressure Gas

At high pressures, the electrons from the 90Sr sources are strongly attenuated in range and scattered
due to the increased gas density and more often prevented from reaching the start-trigger ﬁbres than
at atmospheric pressure. A considerable fraction of the 𝛽-electrons are produced with an energy
around 500 keV [14], that have an approximate range of 10 cm in 10 bar argon [15], see ﬁgure 2a.
It is necessary, that 𝛽-electrons can penetrate the pressurized gas to reach the start-trigger ﬁbres
and then still carry enough energy to produce scintillation light. Therefore, the distance which the
𝛽-electrons have to cross from source to ﬁbre was chosen to be smaller than 10 cm. The electrons
enter the ﬁeld cage in a collimated beam that is further widened by multiple scattering. Opposing
the 90Sr sources, and their collimation, are 8 × 1 mm2 start-trigger ﬁbres aligned such that only
tracks are selected, that have not been deﬂected more than one ﬁbre height (1 mm) along the drift
direction (compare ﬁgure 2b).

A more fundamental diﬀerence to an atmospheric GMC comes from the fact that the sources
have to be placed inside the pressurized volume, as the 𝛽-electrons can not penetrate the pressure
vessel – a 2.5 MeV electron has a range of only ∼ 2 mm in stainless steel [15], which is less than the
vessel wall thickness (section 4). The sources are classiﬁed as ISO/12/C64344 [16], which certiﬁes
save operation up to 70 bar overpressure.

3.2 High Voltage Safe Operation

The drift velocity is a function of the reduced ﬁeld E∗ [Eq. 2.2]. An increase in pressure will expand
drift velocity curves along the electric ﬁeld axis. This eﬀect can be cancelled by a proportional
increase of the drift ﬁeld 𝐸 to keep E∗ constant. Typical drift ﬁelds are of the order of a few
100 V/cm 1/bar (30 V/cm K/mbar) – to reach the corresponding reduced ﬁelds at 10 bar, the HPGMC is
designed for a maximum cathode voltage of 30 kV with a ∼ 10 cm long ﬁeld cage.

One concern with high voltages are electric breakdowns, that could damage parts of the detector

or readout electronics. The breakdown in a gas can be calculated by Paschen’s Law

𝑉b( 𝑝𝑑) =

B𝑝𝑑
ln (A𝑝𝑑) − ln (cid:2)ln (cid:0)1 + 𝛾−1
se

,

(cid:1) (cid:3)

(3.1)

that predicts the breakdown voltage 𝑉b between two idealized parallel surfaces separated by a
gas at pressure 𝑝, the separation distance 𝑑, gas-speciﬁc parameters A, B and a material constant
𝛾se [17, 18]. The parameters A, B are experimentally found to be constant over a limited range of
E/p [18]. For scans over larger ranges, A, B can not be assumed to be constant, but can be calculated
from Townsend simulations of pure gasses, e.g. with MagBoltz [18–20].

The secondary electron emission coeﬃcient 𝛾se describes how many electrons are released
from ions impacting on the cathode and reach the anode.
It depends on the involved electrode
materials and is highest for alkali metals [18]. Its inﬂuence on the resulting 𝑉b is negligible for high
voltages and pressures, where

ﬁeld cage where the 𝛽-electrons cross the drift volume. The collimation bores and opposing ﬁbres

The fraction 𝑉b/𝑉applied is used to determine a safe operation limit by choosing insulation

distances such that

𝑉b( 𝑝𝑑)

!> 2 · 𝑉applied, with 𝑝 = 1 bar.

(3.3)

In ﬁgure 3, contours of constant fractions between applied and breakdown voltage are calculated
by evaluating [Eq. 3.3]. At the maximum design voltage of 30 kV for the HPGMC, the clearance
between the cathode on high voltage and the pressure vessel on ground potential would have to be
larger than 12 cm. This would introduce too much dead space to comply with a limit of 5 ℓ for the
inner volume (section 3). Therefore, the vessel walls of the HPGMC are lined with 4 mm PFA, a
PTFE derivative with a high dielectric strength of 80 kV/mm [21] and low outgassing [22]. Argon
at 10 bar pressure requires about 1/10 of the insulation distance of atmospheric argon [Eq. 3.2].
Initially, the requirement from [Eq. 3.3] was arbitrarily chosen. To date, we have operated the
HPGMC often at its design maximum, and never experienced breakdown of the gaseous insulators.
Special care has to be taken for the location of the radioactive sources. To retain a reasonable
signal rate, the sources have to be as close as possible to the drift volume. This exposes them
to voltages up to 30 kV for the far source, which sits close to the cathode plane. Electrostatic
simulations with Agros2D [23] have been performed for the far source position to determine the
minimum required distance from [Eq. 3.3]. The 2 mm × 10 mm sources are installed in brass

capsules, which then are placed close to the ﬁeld cage inside a solid holder made from POM1
(ﬁgure 4 and section 4). The near position is always exposed to lower voltages, but is placed at the
same distance from the ﬁeld cage as the far source.

4 The High Pressure Gas Monitoring Chamber: HPGMC

The HPGMC uses a stainless steel, industry standard ﬂanged cross pipe with modiﬁed blind ﬂanges
for electrical and gas connections to the inside (ﬁgure 5) with an inner volume of ∼ 4.5 ℓ and a wall
thickness of ∼ 3 mm. In the central region, a cylindrical ﬁeld cage with a single, 20 𝜇m diameter,
gold-plated tungsten anode wire forms the gas multiplication stage. Figure 6 shows the view along
the ﬁeld cage, through the wire-plane cathode. Below the horizontal slit in the bottom plane runs
the anode wire. Electron tracks cross vertically (blue arrow), so that signals originate from tracks
that cross the centre point of the ﬁeld cage.

The side arms of the vessel are instrumented with the trigger system and 90Sr source holders
on opposite sides in exchangeable POM structures. The front face of these structures have comb-
like ridges, that ﬁt between the ﬁeld cage rings (compare ﬁgures 2b and 4). This yields a good
precision of the alignment, especially in Δ𝑧, while avoiding a permanent ﬁxation to the ﬁeld cage or
pressure vessel. Replacement of most inner parts can be accomplished in short time and diﬀerent
technologies can be tested without the need for construction of a new ﬁeld cage or pressure vessel.
Plastic scintillating ﬁbres are used for the start trigger, since the trigger system only needs to provide
a fast timing signal and no rejection based on calorimetric information. By equipping the near and
far ﬁbres with two Silicon Photo Multipliers each, small signals can be separated from background
(e.g. dark counts) by requiring a coincidence.

The cathode has been ﬁxed at the maximum voltage of 30 kV, ﬁeld rings at their corresponding
degraded voltage and the pressure vessel outside the PFA cladding is grounded. Source and
capsule are metallic, but left electrically ﬂoating within the POM holding structure. The calculated
breakdown ﬁeld inside the bore is always more than twice of the actual ﬁeld. The inset shows the
actual sources holders with a 1 Yen coin for scale (20 mm diameter). The holding structures are
held in place by the rigid ﬁeld cage.

The maximum ﬁeld of the HPGMC is ∼ 3000 V/cm, resulting in a reduced ﬁeld of almost
90 V/cm K/mbar at 10 bar and room temperature. Gas is supplied from premixed bottles and regulated
with a bottle pressure regulator in high pressure operation. A pressure relieve valve limits the over
pressure of the vessel to 11 bar.

The crate is equipped with pressure and temperature sensors to monitor the operation and
environmental conditions. The complete setup has been designed to be mobile for use with a host
detector, e.g. a TPC at a test beam facility.

5 Precision of Measurements

The maximum obtainable precision of any measurement performed with the HPGMC can be
calculated a priori by evaluating the systematic uncertainties on E∗ and 𝑣d. Temperature and
pressure measurement precisions are a combination of sensor element precision (PT100 Class
A [24] and calibrated WIKA A10 16 bar [25]) and the custom readout electronics used for these
devices [26]. The drift ﬁeld precision is a combination of HV regulation (iSeg EPn30 [27]),
resistor chain accuracy and ﬁeld cage length accuracy from measurements, see table 1 for a list.
From [eq. 2.1] follows, that uncertainties on the diﬀerence in arrival time and the track positions
contribute. The positions are determined by the minima of second order polynomial ﬁts to the

expected from the spread of arrival times caused by the 1 mm source’s collimation.

Timing precision is given by the reconstruction accuracy of artiﬁcial drift velocity peaks
(compare ﬁgure 1b) of known Δ𝑡 with a function generator and the full analysis chain with the used
digitizer (CAEN VX1720) [28, 29]. The centers of the 1 mm diameter 𝛽-electron beams are known
to 0.1 mm.

is dominated by the used HV output precision for lower ﬁelds. The drift velocity is approximately
equally limited by the collimation width of the used 90Sr sources and time reconstruction accuracy.

6 Drift Velocity of P10

Commissioning of the HPGMC was carried out using premixed P10 gas (Ar:CH4 – 90:10) up to
a maximum pressure of 10 bar in a temperature controlled laboratory at 𝑇 = (296 ± 0.5) K. The
used P10 mixture was calibrated by the distributor to consist of 10.0 ± 0.2 %mol CH4 4.5 in Ar
5.0. Measurement runs were performed at three diﬀerent pressure settings from ≈ 1.5 bar up to
the maximum reachable pressure of 10 bar with an intermediate run at 5 bar. Figure 7 shows our
measurements together with two external data sources [9, 30] and the MagBoltz expectation [19].
Every pressure setting was maintained for a week with continuous measurements to verify a stable
𝑣d curve.

The results show, that density scaling by [Eq. 2.2] holds up to 10 bar. A voltage of 3600 V
on the anode wire produced enough electron multiplication at 10 bar. This means higher pressures
are only prohibitive from pressure vessel regulations and not the maximum anode voltage of 5 kV,
imposed by the used SHV feedthrough. The ampliﬁcation electronics are AC coupled to the anode
wire and can decouple signals up to a 10 kV DC oﬀset.

7 Comparison to Simulation

Since the gas in a TPC is both target and medium for transport of charge signals, its drift parameters
are a crucial input to detector development from the early design phase on. Especially during the
conceptional stage, researchers heavily rely on the accuracy of simulation programs for modelling.
It is therefore desirable to establish the accuracy and validity range of standard simulation programs,
such as MagBoltz.

The relative deviation of measurements from this work and external data are shown in ﬁgure 8.
Huk et al. [9] and our measurements found slower drift velocities at ﬁelds below 50 V/cm K/mbar,

Scaling with ET/p holds over the full tested span up to 10 bar. As a reference, an additional ESTP-axis
was added, which scales ET/p to STP conditions (𝑝0 = 1.013 bar and 𝑇0 = 298 K). Errors are statistic
and systematic combined.

compared to simulation, and faster values for ﬁelds exceeding 60 V/cm K/mbar. The mixing uncertainty
of our mixture is added as additional ratio graphs by simulating 𝑣d with CH4 content at 9.8 %mol
and 10.2 %mol.

d

The region of the drift velocity maximum at ∼ 38 V/cm K/mbar is of particular interest for many
detectors, as it oﬀers minimal change in 𝑣d caused by ﬂuctuations of temperature and pressure [11].
At E∗(𝑣max
), the mixture can be expected to be sensitive to impurities due to the low total cross
section caused by the Ramsauer minimum [12, 31]. Our measurements are consistent across all
pressures in that region; an indication that impurities through partial pressure driven outgassing of
detector materials are negligible. The impact of outgassing was tested by isolating the HPGMC
from the gas ﬂow, while continuously measuring drift velocities at points around the 𝑣d maximum
and additional points at high and low E∗. Over a duration of 7 days and at a pressure of 1.5 bar, only
a -2 % eﬀect on 𝑣d was measured at 𝑣max
. At low ﬁelds, the impact of degrading gas purity was
signiﬁcantly larger with a reduction in 𝑣d of almost 20 %. Re-establishing the gas ﬂow recovered
the previous 𝑣d values after 24 h and remained independent of an additionally increased gas ﬂow.
It is notable, that there exists an E∗ in simulation, for which the mixing uncertainty has vanishing
impact on 𝑣d at about 20 V/cm K/mbar. This point lies on the rising ﬂank of the 𝑣d curve; a region that
is particularly aﬀected by outgassing, as observed by our tests.

8 Summary and Conclusion

(cid:104)

The HPGMC is a miniature TPC capable of operation with drift gases up to 10 bar pressure. It can
be used for continuous calibration of a host detector or as a stand-alone experiment to study electron
drift parameters. The anode plane can be exchanged to investigate the response and stability of
diﬀerent multiplication geometries in novel gas mixtures at atmospheric or high pressure. The high
maximum drift ﬁeld of 3000 V/cm covers the range of commonly employed drift ﬁelds up into the
high pressure regime. With a small inner volume of ∼ 4.5 ℓ, rapid exchanges of the gas mixture
under investigation are possible, resulting in a reduced delayed response for live monitoring. Scaling
of drift velocity curves at changing pressures was found to be consistently following E∗ = ET/p over
a wide span of ∼ 10 bar. The system is highly mobile and has already accompanied a test beam
experiment at CERN [32]. Measurements with argon based drift gases at both very low and very
high, up to 100 %, quencher fractions are ongoing.
