Abstract In this study, we present the investigation of eleven recurring solar
jets originated from two diﬀerent sites (site 1 and site 2) close to each other (≈ 11
Mm) in the NOAA active region (AR) 12035 during 15–16 April 2014. The jets
were observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescope onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Two jets were observed by
the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital,
India telescope in Hα. On 15 April ﬂux emergence is important in site 1 while
on 16 April ﬂux emergence and cancellation mechanisms are involved in both
sites. The jets of both sites have parallel trajectories and move to the south with
a speed between 100 and 360 km s−1. The jets of site 2 occurred during the
second day and have a tendency to move towards the jets of site 1 and merge
with them. We conjecture that the slippage of the jets could be explained by
the complex topology of the region with the presence of a few low-altitude null
points and many quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which could intersect with one
another.

1. Introduction

Solar jets are small scale dynamic events observed as collimated ejections of
plasma material from the lower solar atmosphere to coronal heights. Many jets
are observed in active regions (for example see Schmieder et al., 1983, Gu et al.,
1994, Schmieder et al., 2013, Guo et al., 2013a, Chandra et al., 2017 and refer-
ences cited therein). They are observed in a wide range of electromagnetic spectra
from the optical to UV–EUV and X-rays. Jets are particularly visible in coronal
hole (CH) regions (Madjarska et al., 2013), probably because these are regions
of open magnetic ﬁelds with less EUV background emission. In chromospheric
spectral lines, solar jets are called surges. Surges and jets are associated with
base brightening, referred as “jet bright points” (Sterling and Moore, 2016).
For state-of-art observations, theory and models of jets, we refer the review of
Raouaﬁ et al. (2016).

The soft X-ray telescope onboard Yohkoh satellite opened a new view on
understanding solar jets with the pioneer paper of Shibata et al. (1992) followed
by several studies deriving the characteristics of solar jets such as velocity,
height, temperature, width, and density (Shimojo et al., 1996; Shimojo, Shibata,
and Harvey, 1998; Shimojo and Shibata, 2000; Schmieder et al., 2013; Chandra
et al., 2015). Using the SECCHI/EUVI data Nistic`o et al. (2009) performed a
morphological study of 79 coronal jets and found that 31 have helical structures.
Five jets were associated with micro–CMEs.

In some cases solar jets are associated with eruption of the full base region.
Such types of jets are called “blow-out jets” (Moore et al., 2010, 2013; Hong et al.,
2011; Shen et al., 2012; Chandra et al., 2017). When successive jets occur at the
same location and with similar morphological properties in some time interval,
they are called homologous recurrent jets. Usually they are ejected in the same
direction and their footpoint structures are similar. Several studies have been
performed about recurrent homologous jets in diﬀerent wavelengths such as in
Hα (Asai, Ishii, and Kurokawa, 2001; Uddin et al., 2012; Chandra et al., 2017),
in EUV (Chae et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2007; Schmieder et al., 2013; Joshi et al.,
2017), and in X-rays (Kim, Kim, and Jang, 2001; Kamio et al., 2007; Sterling
and Moore, 2016).

Based on the X-ray jets and EUV/UV jets observed by Hinode and SDO/AIA
respectively, a new jet formation model has been proposed by Sterling and co-
workers (Sterling et al., 2017; Panesar, Sterling, and Moore, 2017). According
to their model all the jets would be originated by the eruption of a small–
scale ﬁlament or “miniﬁlament”, as already mentioned in Hong et al. (2011)
and Shen et al. (2012). Sterling and Moore (2016) found that the miniﬁlament
eruption kinematics was similar to the kinematics of most observed large ﬁlament
eruptions. In large ﬁlament eruptions it was commonly observed that the slow
rise phase is followed by the fast rise acceleration phase. The association of
miniﬁlament eruptions was also observed in CH regions (Sterling et al., 2015)
and in quiet regions (Panesar, Sterling, and Moore, 2017). However, Sterling and
Moore (2016) and Sterling et al. (2017) found that the existence of miniﬁlament
eruptions in active region jets are sometimes diﬃcult to observe.

Slippage of Jets Explained by the Magnetic Topology

The explosive dynamic nature, morphology and magnetic conﬁguration of the
jets at their base support the idea that they are the result of magnetic recon-
nection. Magnetic reconnection at null–points is proposed in several jet models.
It is also conﬁrmed by magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations and simulations (Moreno-
Insertis, Galsgaard, and Ugarte-Urra, 2008; Zhang et al., 2012; Schmieder et al.,
2013). In some of the studies circular ribbons have been observed at the base of
jets (Wang and Liu, 2012). This topology also supports the presence of magnetic
null–points above jet locations.

However, using photospheric magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations, Mandrini et al.
(1996) and Guo et al. (2013b) explained the jets by the presence of bald patch
(BP) regions along QSLs without the existence of null–points. QSLs are thin
layers with a ﬁnite gradient in the connectivity of the magnetic ﬁeld where
magnetic reconnection can occur. Very recently, Chandra et al. (2017) computed
the magnetic topology of the NOAA active region 10484 on 21–24 October 2003
and found that the ﬂares and jets occurring in this region were due to magnetic
reconnection at the BP separatrices. BP separatrices are regions where magnetic
ﬁeld lines are not anchored on the photosphere but are tangent between two
diﬀerent magnetic regions. The global magnetic topology of active regions is
commonly determined by potential extrapolation which allows the computation
of QSL locations, which are relatively robustly determined (Demoulin et al.,
1996). QSLs are measured by the computation of the squashing degree Q, pro-
posed by Titov, Hornig, and D´emoulin (2002). The squashing degree increases
with the growth of connectivity gradients, and becomes inﬁnite for separatrices.
QSLs footprints in the photosphere coincide with the ﬂare ribbons even if the
shape is not always perfectly represented (Dalmasse et al., 2015; Zuccarello et al.,
2017).

Flux emergence in the photosphere could be one of the drivers of solar jets.
According to this scenario, it is the reconnection between the newly emerged
magnetic ﬂux (EMF) and the pre–existing magnetic ﬂux that leads to the forma-
tion of jets. The reconnection can be driven by the motions in the newly emerged
ﬂux. To explain this magnetic reconnection the ﬁrst dynamical model was pro-
posed in two dimensions (2D) (Yokoyama and Shibata, 1995, 1996). Now EUV
and X-ray jets are being modeled with 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simu-
lations (Moreno-Insertis, Galsgaard, and Ugarte-Urra, 2008; Moreno-Insertis and
Galsgaard, 2013; Archontis and Hood, 2013; T¨or¨ok et al., 2009). The background
corona for both 2D and 3D models is an open magnetic ﬁeld.

Another scenario proposed for the jet origin is the loss–of–equilibrium mech-
anism. In this mechanism, the jet occurs when the stressed closed ﬂux under the
null–point reconnects with the surrounding quasi-potential ﬂux exterior to the
fan surface. The reconnection starts when some threshold altitude is reached.
In this scenario, the jet displays an untwisting motion (Pariat, Antiochos, and
DeVore, 2009, 2010; Dalmasse et al., 2012; Pariat et al., 2015).

Flux cancellation at the jet locations is also frequently proposed as the driver
of jets (Innes, McIntosh, and Pietarila, 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Innes et al., 2016;
Adams et al., 2014; Young and Muglach, 2014; Cheung et al., 2015; Chen et al.,
2015). Zhang et al. (2000) proposed such ﬂux cancellation between oppositely
directed magnetic ﬁeld to explain macrospicules and microscopic jets. Adams

R. Joshi et al.

et al. (2014) also found magnetic ﬂux convergence and cancellation along the
polarity inversion line (PIL), where the jets were initiated. In Guo et al. (2013a)
the cancelling ﬂux occurred at the edge of EMF during its expansion. Therefore,
it is still discussed if jets are due to ﬂux emerging or cancelling or both.

The NOAA AR 12035 had a very high productivity of activity during 15–16
April 2014 with many conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares in its northern part and jets in
its southern part. The conﬁned and eruptive ﬂares from this active region have
been studied in Zuccarello et al. (2017). They explained that the eruptive ﬂares
become more and more conﬁned, when the overlying magnetic ﬁeld becomes less
and less anti–parallel.

In this study, we investigate the morphology, kinematics and magnetic causes
of the solar jets during 15–16 April 2014 from NOAA AR 12035. The paper
is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the observational data, morphology,
kinematics and the magnetic conﬁguration of the active region. The magnetic
topology of the active region is discussed in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we
discuss and conclude our results.

2. Observations

′′

The NOAA AR 12035 produced many solar jets during 15–16 April 2014 to-
wards the south direction. We have selected eleven clearly visible jets for our
investigation. Their description is given in Table 1. These jets were observed
by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al., 2012) onboard Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012) in
diﬀerent EUV and UV wavebands. The spatial and temporal resolution of AIA
data are 1.2
and 12 s respectively. To study the magnetic conﬁguration around
the location of the jets we have used the line–of–sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld
data from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al., 2012) having a
and a cadence of 45 s. On 16 April 2014 two jets, that we
spatial resolution of 1
will name jet J5 and J′
5 in the next section, were observed in Hα by the 15 cm
Coud´e telescope operating at Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational
Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, India (Figure 1). The pixel size and cadence are
0.58
and 1 min respectively. For consistency, we have shifted all the images to
16 April 2014 10:30 UT.

For identifying the onset and peak time of the jets, we look into the temporal
evolution of intensity at the jet foot-point. We create a box containing the bright
jet base and calculate the total intensity inside it. Then this total intensity is
normalized by the intensity of the quiet region.

The morphology, kinematics and magnetic conﬁguration of the jet locations

are described in the following subsections.

2.1. EUV Observations

The eleven selected jets during 15–16 April 2014 are named as J1–J7 and J′
3–
J′
6 respectively. Out of eleven jets, the ﬁrst two jets J1 and J2 occur on 15 April
and the remaining nine jets are on 16 April 2014. These jets originated from two

locations in the south part of the NOAA AR 12035. One location is at position
[X,Y] = [-220
] (Figure 1 left panel). In
this paper, we will refer them as site 1 jets (J) and site 2 jets (J′) respectively.
The two sites are at a distance of 15 arcsec from each other (≈ 11 Mm). Figure 2
displays images of the eleven jets observed with the AIA ﬁlters at 304 ˚A (top),
193 ˚A (middle) and 94 ˚A (bottom) during their peak phase. Almost all the jets
are visible in all EUV channels, which indicates the multi-thermal nature of the
jets. The onset and end time of each jet are summarized in Table 1.

3 was like a circular ribbon and broader than J3. Jet J′

Jet J1 started on 15 April 2014 with a bright base at site 1. The zoomed
view of evolution of jet J1 in AIA 211 ˚A is shown in Figure 3. Together with
the ejection of bright material, we have also observed the ejection of cool and
dark material in 211 ˚A (see Figure 3c). The dark jet is due to the presence of
cool material absorbing the coronal emission. The bright and cool jet material
were rotating clockwise (see the attached movie in 211 ˚A). After the onset of
≈ 2 min it started to rotate anti-clockwise. This indicates the untwisting of the
system to relax to a lower energy state by propagating twist outwards. The jet
J2 started also with a bright base similar to J1 from the same location. This jet
was also showing untwisting like as in the case of J1. However, its base was less
bright and less broader than J1.
On 16 April 2014 J3 and J′

3 started from site 1 and site 2 respectively. The
base of J′
4 is bigger than
J4. Jet J4 peaks almost simultaneously in all EUV wavelengths around 07:17
UT. The peak time for J′
4 is ﬁve minutes later than J4, around 07:21 UT in all
wavebands. One diﬀerence between these jets and J1–J′
3 was that they have no
rotation. The evolution of jets J5 and J′
5 is presented in Figure 4 in AIA 211
˚A. In contrast to the other jets, the peak time for jet J5 and J′
5 is diﬀerent for
diﬀerent wavebands. The peak time for J5 at 304 ˚A is 10:38:30 UT, and at 94
˚A is 10:41 UT. For the case of J′
5, the peak time in 304 ˚A is 10:37:30 and at
94 ˚A is 10:38 UT. For these jets, the peak for cool plasma (longer wavelength
304 ˚A) appears earlier than the hot plasma material (shorter wavelength 94
˚A). The temporal evolution of ﬂux at the base of jet J5 is shown in Figure 5.
This behavior is contrary to other jets reported in the literature where hotter
plasma appears before cooler plasma, suggesting some mechanism of cooling
versus time (Alexander and Fletcher, 1999). These are the largest jets among
the ones discussed in this study. As the event progress, interestingly part of
jet J′
5 was detached from it and moved towards site 1 and ﬁnally merged with
jet J5 (see the attached movie in 211 ˚A). We have estimated the speed of J′
5
towards J5 as ≈ 45 km s−1. Merging of the broken part of J′
5 with J5 made
it bigger as it was ejected in the south as well as in the north direction at the
same time. We have also noticed the circular ribbon at the base of J′
5, shown in
Figure 4e. Looking at the evolution of the J′
5 jet, we found that the jet follows a
sigmoidal-shape loop path visible in AIA 193 ˚A (see Figure 6). These loops are
originating from the sunspot and going towards the south with a sigmoid-shape.
The sigmoidal-shape of these loops could be due the the clockwise rotation of big
positive polarity spot (see Section 2.4). We have observed the clockwise rotation
in jet J5 and the calculated rotation speed in four wavelengths 171 ˚A , 193˚A ,
211 ˚A and in 304 ˚A. The speed varies from 90 km s−1 to 130 km s−1. Jet J6

was small and of weak intensity whereas J′
6 had a strong intensity and was very
bright, wide and had a circular base. J′
6 started to move towards site 1, but
like in the case of J′
5, it could not reach up to J6 location. We did not ﬁnd any
rotation in this jet. Jet J7 started from site 1 location and also showed clockwise
rotation.

Let us summarize the diﬀerent morphological features of these jets. We have
found that all jets from site 1 have similar morphology. Jets from site 2 also have
similar morphology, but this is diﬀerent from the morphology of jets ejected from
site 1. One common feature in all jets of site 2 on 16 April was that after their
trigger they all have a tendency to move towards site 1 before or during the
ejections. It seems that for the case of J5 and J′
5, there is a connection between
these two. Another common feature of jets originated from site 2 is that they
all follow the sigmoidal loops visible in diﬀerent AIA wavebands. The jets from
site 2 occur before or almost simultaneously (in the case of J′
4) with the jets
from site 1. This is true apart from the jet J6. The main diﬀerence is that J6 is
quite weak among all of the coupled jets. We have noticed that jets observed in
193 ˚A are thinner than in 304 ˚A. All jets started with a bright base, similar to
common X-ray jet observations.

2.2. Hα Observations

Two jets– jet J5 and J′
5 were also observed in the Hα line center (6563 ˚A) by
ARIES, Nainital, India as a bright ejecta. The bandwidth of the Hα ﬁlter was
0.5 ˚A with a cadence of 1 min. Hα jets from both jets sites started at ≈ 10:35
UT, one minute later than in the EUV wavebands and they faded away at ≈
10:50 UT. We also observed the dark material ejection surge between the bright
jets from the two sites site 1 and site 2 respectively. To compare the spatial
location of Hα with EUV images, we have over-plotted the contours of Hα in
AIA 304 ˚A and 171 ˚A . The result is shown in Figure 1. We found that Hα
jets are coaligned with the EUV jets. However, the position of the Hα jet is
only at the origin of the EUV jets. It may be because the Hα jets are in the
chromosphere and have less height than the EUV jets. The bright ejections in
Hα are followed by dark material ejections. It could be the cooler part of the jet.
This cooler part is spatially shifted towards the west side from the bright jets.

2.3. Height–Time Analysis

To understand the kinematics and dynamics of the observed jets, we have made
a time-distance analysis in diﬀerent AIA/EUV channels i.e. 94, 131, 171, 193,
211, and 304 ˚A. To perform this analysis, we adopted two methods, one is the
time–slice technique and the other is tracking of the leading edge of the jets. For
the time–slice technique, we ﬁxed a slit at the center of the jets and observed
the motion of plasma along the slit. An example of this time–slice analysis of jet
J1 on 15 April 2014 is presented in Figure 7. In the ﬁgure, the left image shows
the location of the slit (drawn as a black dashed line) and the right denotes
the height-distance maps at diﬀerent EUV wavelengths. Using this time–slice
technique, we have computed the heights and projected speeds for the diﬀerent

SOLA: April_jets_editorial_corrections.tex; 10 March 2021; 1:26; p. 6

Slippage of Jets Explained by the Magnetic Topology

structures of all jets at diﬀerent wavelengths, shown in the right panel of the
ﬁgures. For the same jet of 15 April 2014 at 193 ˚A, the height–time plot using the
leading edge procedure is presented in Figure 8. The curve has an exponential
behavior with two acceleration phases. We decided to ﬁt linearly the beginning
of the expansion and then the later phase in order to compared the values with
those of the other methods. Two speed values are derived. The ﬁrst is 117 km
s−1 which is nearly half of the speed derived after the acceleration phase (252
km s−1). The error is around 10 km s−1 according to the points chosen for the
ﬁts.

4: 295 –325 km s−1, J5: 174 –202 km s−1, J′

The time–slice technique indicates that every jet has multi-speed structures
and the speeds of the jets are diﬀerent in diﬀerent EUV wavelengths. The average
speed by the time–slice technique varies in diﬀerent wavelengths for J1: 205 –
3: 100 –121 km s−1, J4:
295 km s−1, J2: 177–235 km s−1, J3: 132–163 km s−1, J′
133 –164 km s−1, J′
5: 275 –364 km
6: 304 –343 km s−1, and for J7: 154 –217 km s−1
s−1, J6: 156 –197 km s−1 J′
respectively. The dispersion of the values for one jet according to the diﬀerent
considered wavelengths is between 10% to 50%, with no rule. It is diﬃcult to
understand if it is just the range of the uncertainties of the measurements or if
it really corresponds to the existence of multi-components in the jet with multi-
temperatures and speeds or if the slit of the time distance diagram is crossing
diﬀerent components of the jets. We have compared these results with the speed
derived by the leading edge procedure. We found that the fast speed ﬁts with the
time-distance derived velocity. The time-distance technique with a straight slit
ignores the ﬁrst phase of the jets. The values of speed derived by both methods
are presented in Table 1.

We have also computed the lifetimes, widths, and the maximum heights of
each jet. The lifetimes vary from 6 to 24 min. J5 has the maximum lifetime (24
min), whereas J′
4 has the minimum (6 min) lifetime. In general, we found the
narrow and long life–time jets achieved more height than the wide and short
lifetime jets. We have also noticed that the lifetimes of jets are longer in 304 ˚A
and in 171 ˚A than in 94 ˚A. The width ranges from 2.6–6 Mm. The maximum
height was attained by J5 and it was 217 Mm.

2.4. Evolution of Photospheric Magnetic Field

The NOAA AR 12035 appeared at the east limb on 11 April 2014 with a β
magnetic conﬁguration. It went over the west limb on 24 April 2014. Figure 9
presents the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of the active region observed by SDO/HMI
during 15–16 April 2014. The active region consists of two large positive polarity
sunspots P1 and P2 followed by the negative polarity spot N1 (see Figure 14a).
The positive polarity P1 behaves like a decaying sunspot with a “moat region”
around it. When the sunspot is close to its decay stage, it loses its polarity by
dispersing in all directions. This dispersed positive polarity cancels a part of
the negative magnetic polarity left at the site of the jet location. The origin of
jet activity lies between the two leading positive polarities. As seen in Figure 9
the whole active region shows clockwise rotation (see also the attached movie

SOLA: April_jets_editorial_corrections.tex; 10 March 2021; 1:26; p. 7

R. Joshi et al.

MOV3). Together with the rotation of the whole active region, the western big
spot P1 also shows a rotation in the same direction as the active region.

The sunspot rotation makes the active region sheared and the loops connect-
ing the preceding positive polarity and the following negative polarity become
sigmoidal (see Figure 6). The jets are ejected in the south-east direction instead
of south direction probably because of the upper part of the sigmoidal loops.

To investigate the magnetic ﬁeld evolution at the jet’s origin, we have carefully
analyzed the development of diﬀerent polarities. On 15 April, we observed the
positive polarity P1 and in its south a bunch of negative polarity N2 and a
positive polarity p (Figure 9). Site 1 of the jet’s origin is located between N2
and p. Site 2 is located to the west of site 1.

The zoomed view of magnetic ﬂux evolution at site 1 is shown in Figure
10. In the ﬁgure, we have noticed several patches of emerging ﬂux of positive
and negative polarities. In addition to this emerging ﬂux, we have interestingly
found that the negative polarity N2 and the positive polarity p came closer
and cancelled each other. The jet’s cancelling location is represented by the red
arrow. To examine the ﬂux cancellation at the jet site 1, we made a time-slice
diagram along the slit shown in Figure 10 as the yellow dashed line. The result
is presented in Figure 12. The positive and negative ﬂux approached each other
and cancelled afterwards. We have drawn the start and end time of the jets from
site 1 and this is shown in the ﬁgure by vertical red dashed lines. We noticed
that the jet activity from site 1 was between this ﬂux cancellation site. Further,
we did quantitative measurements in the box at jet site 1 drawn in Figure 9
(top, middle panel). The positive, negative and total signed ﬂux variation as a
function of time calculated over the box is shown in Figure 13a. On 15 April the
ﬂux is constantly emerging even with some cancellation around 16:00 UT, on
16 April the ﬂux decreases due to cancellation. For site 2, the enlarged version
of magnetic ﬁeld evolution is shown in Figure 11. The emergence of diﬀerent
positive and negative patches is shown by green and cyan arrows respectively.
Around the site 2 location, we have observed positive polarities surrounded by a
kind of supergranule cell. Inside this positive polarity supergranule, small bipoles
with mainly negative polarities are continuously emerging. For the quantitative
evolution of the positive, negative and total magnetic ﬂux at the site 2 location,
we have also calculated the magnetic ﬂux as a function of time inside the red box
(top, middle) of Figure 9. The variation of magnetic ﬂux with time is shown in
Figure 13b. We have noticed that the emergence of magnetic ﬁeld is continuously
followed by the cancellation. At site 2, all the four jets are present on 16 April
and we have drawn the onset and end time of these jets. The jet duration over
site 2 is denoted by the green dashed lines in Figure 13b. We found that the jets
from site 2 were lying in between the emergence and the cancellation site.

In summary, we have noticed the continuous magnetic ﬂux emergence followed
by cancellation at site 1 during the time of the jet on 15 April, On 16 April ﬂux
emergence and cancellation are recurrent at both sites.

3. Magnetic Topology

The longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld maps observed by HMI show a strong complexity
of the polarity pattern and a fast evolution (Figures 9, 10, 11) in the two sites
where the two series of jets are initiated. Looking carefully at the AIA movies
we have detected a shift of the jets from site 2 to site 1 and never from site
1 to site 2. The shift is not always fully accomplished or fully observed. The
best case is jet J′
5 from site 2 which completely merged with J5 from site 1. It
is important to understand why there is a slippage of the magnetic ﬁeld lines.
Slippage reconnection has been observed in many ﬂares (Priest and Forbes, 1992;
Berlicki et al., 2004; Aulanier, Pariat, and D´emoulin, 2005; Dud´ık et al., 2012).
Commonly it is due to the slippage of magnetic ﬁeld lines anchored along QSL
structures. The slippage occurs when and where the squashing degree is high
enough along the QSL to force the reconnection. Demoulin et al. (1996) and
Demoulin (1998) has shown, theoretically and observationally, how it can be

produced. Dalmasse et al. (2015) demonstrated that the QSLs are robust struc-
tures and can be computed in potential conﬁgurations. Qualitatively the results
are very good with this approach and there is a relatively good ﬁt between the
location of QSL footprints with the observed ﬂare ribbons (Aulanier, Pariat, and
D´emoulin, 2005). However when the magnetic conﬁguration is too complex, the
QSL footprints do not ﬁt perfectly and a one to one comparison is increasingly
diﬃcult with smaller and smaller scale polarities (Dalmasse et al., 2015). The
beneﬁt of using linear force–free ﬁeld (LFFF) extrapolation can be weak since
QSLs are robust to parameter changes. In the present case, LFFF extrapolation
would perhaps help to follow the path of the jets which shows some curvature
at their bases (mentioned as a sigmoidal shape in the text of Section 2.1 ) but
at the expense of the geometry of loops at large heights. However, the magnetic
ﬁeld strength is really fragmented in the jet regions. Pre-processing the data
would smear electric currents in their moving weak polarities, so it will not help
to derive better QSLs. Therefore to investigate the magnetic topology of the
jet producing regions, we use the same potential magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation of
AR 12035 calculated in Zuccarello et al. (2017). This method is based on the
fast Fourier transform method of Alissandrakis (1981) and the extrapolation is
performed by using a large ﬁeld-of-view that includes at its center the AR 12035.
This allows us to identify the key topological structures of the active region (see
Figure 14 left panels). Maps of the squashing degree Q at the photospheric
plane were calculated using the topology tracing code topotr (see Priest and
D´emoulin (1995), Demoulin et al. (1996), Pariat and D´emoulin (2012) for more
details). The locations of the largest values of Q deﬁne the footprints of the
QSLs (Demoulin et al., 1996; Aulanier, Pariat, and D´emoulin, 2005) and they
correspond to regions where electric current layers can easily develop.

In Zuccarello et al. (2017) we study the behavior of eruptive and failed erup-
tions occurring in the north-west part of the AR. We have found two QSLs:
the ﬁrst one (Q1 in Figure 14b and c) encircling the positive polarity P1 and
separating the magnetic ﬂux system from the external ﬁeld and a second one
(Q2 in Figure 14b and 14c) highlighting the spine of a high-altitude coronal
null-point similarly to what is seen in Masson et al. (2009). The ﬂares occurred
mainly at the north-west edge of the large QSL (Q1).

Since the fan-like QSL (Q1) encircling the ﬂare region was separated from the
complex QSL system around the jet producing region (at the south of P1), we
have argued that the jet activity and the ﬂares were not really linked to each
other, even if their timings seem to be related (Zuccarello et al., 2017).

On 15 April the jets are initiated in site 1 and we ﬁnd a well deﬁned QSL
surrounding the region of the jet. On 16 April the conﬁguration is much more
complicated with many QSLs which are in the site region of both jets. The zoom
of the Q map of 16 April around the jet producing region (red box of Figure 14c)
is shown in Figure 15. We ﬁnd that the two sites of the jets, site 1 and site 2, are
respectively inside the QSLs Q3 and Q4, and that both were embedded in a larger
QSL, labeled as Q0 in the ﬁgure. We also identiﬁed several quasi photospheric
null points, that are indicated by yellow circles. The QSL map is very complex,
and diﬃcult to analyze and compare in detail with the observations due to the
small scale of the events and fast motion of the small polarities, both the moving

p polarity in site 1 and the emergence of small bipoles in site 2. Since it looks
quite possible that the 2 QSLs (Q3 and Q4) intersect or touch each other, we
conjecture that ﬁeld line foot points could move from site 2 and site 1 by a
sequence of reconnections across QSLs as in Dalmasse et al. (2015). This could
produce the transfer/or tendency of movement of jets from site 2 to site 1, as we
have observed for jets J5 and J′
5 for example (Figure 4). In the case of the other
jets from site 2, they also show a tendency of slippage towards site 1. On 15
April the topology of QSLs in the jet region is more simple. That could explain
perhaps why there are no jets from site 2.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

In this study, we have analyzed eleven solar jets originating from two diﬀerent
sites in the same active region (NOAA AR 12035) during 15–16 April 2014
using the SDO/AIA, HMI, and ARIES Hα data. The magnetic topology of the
active region was discussed using a potential magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation. The
extrapolation was done using HMI photospheric magnetic ﬁeld as the boundary
condition. The main conclusions of our study are as follows:

• We found two sites for the diﬀerent jet’s activity. On 15 April the jets
originated from site 1 and we measure a large increase of emerging ﬂux
and small cancellation. On 16 April site 1 and site 2 are associated with
continuous emerging magnetic ﬂux followed by cancellation at the jet time.
• The kinematics of jets at diﬀerent EUV wavebands revealed that the speeds,
widths, heights and lifetimes of jets are slightly diﬀerent at diﬀerent wave-
lengths. This can be interpreted as the multi–temperature and multi– ve-
locity structure of solar jets.

• Most of the jets showed clockwise rotation, which indicates untwisting. As
a result of this untwisting, the twist/helicity was injected in the upper solar
atmosphere.

• We observed the slippage of jets at site 2 namely J′

6 towards the eastern
site (site 1) and never the reverse movement. Along with the movement of
jets towards site 1, we found, in the case of jet J′
5 that a part detached
from it and moved towards the site 1 location and ﬁnally merge into jet J5.
• On 16 April both jet sites are associated with the QSLs. The possible
intersection of the two QSLs encircling each site could explain the slip
reconnection occurring along the QSLs which favor the translation of jets
from site 2 to site 1.

3–J′

The clockwise rotations (right-to-left) in some of the jets indicate the un-
twisting of the jets. The untwisting jets eject the helicity in the higher solar
atmosphere (Pariat et al., 2015). The injected helicity in the jets may be part
of the global emergence of twisted magnetic ﬁelds. During the rotation like in
the case of jet J1, we observed the rotating jet material contains bright as well
as dark material. This result is consistent with simulations done by Fang, Fan,
and McIntosh (2014). In their simulation, they found the simulated jet consists
of untwisted ﬁeld lines, with a mixture of cold and hot plasma.

The kinematics of the jets indicates that diﬀerent jets have not only dif-
ferent speeds but their speed also varies with diﬀerent wavelengths. This can
be interpreted as multi-temperature and multi-velocity structures in the solar
jets. Our calculated values of the speeds, widths and lifetimes are consistent
with earlier reported values in the literature (Shimojo et al., 1996; Shimojo
and Shibata, 2000; Schmieder et al., 2013; Chandra et al., 2015). We have also
observed that the average lifetime is longer in 304 ˚A than in shorter wavelength
observations, which suggests that the cooler component of jets have a longer
lifetime in comparison to the hotter component. This supports the study of
Nistic`o et al. (2009). Nistic`o et al. (2009) compared the lifetime between 171 ˚A
and 304 ˚A and found that the lifetime is longer for the longer wavelength. For
all the studied jets, except for J5 and J′
5, the jet peak time is simultaneous at
all wavelengths. In the case of J5 and J′
5, the peaks at longer wavelengths are
earlier than at the shorter EUV wavelengths. The time delay between longer
and shorter EUV wavelengths in the case of jet J5 and J′
5 can be interpreted
as during the reconnection, there could be a diﬀerent heating time for diﬀerent
threads.

Thanks to the SDO high spatial and temporal resolution, we could examine
the dynamics of these jets in a more precise way. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the
detached part of J′
5 moved towards J5 and ﬁnally merged with J5. The motion of
the broken part of J′
5 towards the east can be interpreted as the expansion of the
reconnection region with time (Raouaﬁ et al., 2016). As suggested by Sterling
et al. (2015), the coronal jets may be due to the eruption of mini ﬁlaments and
they predicted that the spire of the jets moves away from the jet base bright
point. Our observation of the motion of the broken part of J′
5 is away from the jet
base. This supports the ﬁndings of Savcheva et al. (2009) and the interpretation
proposed by Sterling et al. (2015).

We have observed the ﬂux emergence followed by ﬂux cancellation at site 1
during 15 April 2014. Moreover, on 16 April 2014 ﬂux emergence and cancellation
are recurrent in both jet sites. The observation of cool and hot material in our
study supports the hypothesis of small ﬁlament eruption and a universal mech-
anism for eruptions at diﬀerent scales (Sterling et al., 2015; Wyper, Antiochos,
and DeVore, 2017).
