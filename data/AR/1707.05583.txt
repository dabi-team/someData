The multinucleon transfer reactions near barrier energies has been investigated with a multistep
model based on the dinuclear system (DNS) concept, in which the capture of two colliding nuclei,
the transfer dynamics and the de-excitation process of primary fragments are described by the
analytical formula, the diﬀusion theory and the statistical model, respectively. The nucleon transfer
takes place after forming the DNS and is coupled to the dissipation of relative motion energy and
angular momentum by solving a set of microscopically derived master equations within the potential
energy surface. Speciﬁc reactions of 40,48Ca+124Sn, 40Ca (40Ar, 58Ni)+232Th, 40Ca (58Ni)+238U
and 40,48Ca (58Ni) +248Cm near barrier energies are investigated. It is found that the fragments
are produced by the multinucleon transfer reactions with the maximal yields along the β-stability
line. The isospin relaxation is particularly signiﬁcant in the process of fragment formation. The
incident energy dependence of heavy target-like fragments in the reaction of 58Ni+248Cm is analyzed
thoroughly.

INTRODUCTION

The new isotope synthesis is one of hot topical issues in
nuclear physics. It was obtained much progress over past
decades and a total of 3224 nuclides has been discovered
until the end of 2016 [1]. There are several attempts for
producing the new isotopes in the diﬀerent mass domain,
i.e., projectile fragmentation reactions, ﬁssion of actinide
nuclei, fusion-evaporation reactions etc. However, a large
area of neutron-rich nuclides with N>100 in nuclear chart
is blank up to now. The reaction mechanism is partic-
ularly important for creating the neutron-rich heavy nu-
clei in laboratories. The superheavy nuclei (SHN) syn-
thesized via the fusion-evaporation reactions are neutron-
deﬁcient and far below the neutron magic number N=184
[2, 3]. On the other hand, the properties of neutron-rich
heavy nuclei are particularly important in understanding
the nucleosynthesis during the r-process and the evolu-
tions of shell closure and deformation beyond the neutron
number of N=126. The multi-nucleon transfer (MNT)
reactions and quasiﬁssion (QF) processes have been at-
tempted for producing the heavy neutron-rich nuclei [4–
7]. More relaxation time undergoes in the MNT reac-
tions in comparison to the QF process. The shell eﬀects
are crucially signiﬁcant in the low-energy heavy-ion colli-
sions. Several models have been developed for describing
the transfer reactions, such as the GRAZING model [9],
dinuclear system (DNS) model [10, 11], dynamical model
based on the Langevin equations [12] etc. On the other
hand, the microscopic approaches are proposed, i.e., the
time dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approach [13, 14]
and improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD)
model [15]. The MNT reactions have been investigated

in experiments. The damped collisions of two actinide
nuclei were investigated at Gesellschaft f¨ur Schwerionen-
forschung (GSI) [16–18]. Recently, the attempts to pro-
duce the neutron-rich nuclei around N=126 were per-
formed in the reactions of 136Xe+208Pb in Dubna [19]
and in Argonne National Laboratory [20]. The MNT re-
actions of 136Xe+198Pt were also investigated at GANIL
[21]. It was found that the MNT reactions have advan-
tages in comparison to the projectile fragmentations [22].
In this work, the multinucleon transfer mechanism near
Coulomb barrier energies is investigated with the dinu-

description of the DNS model. The isotopic production
in MNT is discussed in Sec. III. Summary and perspec-
tive on the proton-rich and neutron-rich isotopes are pre-
sented in Sec. IV.

II. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DNS
MODEL

The DNS model has been used to describe the forma-
tion mechanism of superheavy nuclei in the cold fusion
and the 48Ca induced reactions [23]. The production
cross sections of SHN are consistent with the available
data and the blank isotopes between the cold and hot fu-
sion reactions and the new elements of Z=119 and 120 are
predicted with the proposed projectile-target combina-
tions, incident energies and evaporation channels [24, 25].
The multinucleon transfer reactions are to be investi-
gated within the DNS model. The dynamical evolution
of colliding system sequentially proceeds the capture pro-
cess by overcoming the Coulomb barrier, dissipation of
several degrees of freedom (relative energy, angular mo-
mentum, mass and charge asymmetry etc) within the
potential energy surface and the de-excitation of primary
fragments. We use the analytical formula, diﬀusion the-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ory and statistical model for the three stages, respec-
tively. Therefore, the cross sections of the fragments pro-
duced in the MNT reactions are evaluated by

where the E1 is the excitation energy of the fragment
(Z1,N1). The maximal angular momentum is taken to
be the grazing collision of two nuclei. The survival prob-
ability Wsur of each fragment is evaluated with a statisti-
cal approach based on the Weisskopf evaporation theory
[26], in which the excited primary fragments are cooled by
evaporating γ-rays, light particles (neutrons, protons, α
etc) in competition with binary ﬁssion. The structure ef-
fects (shell correction, odd-even eﬀect, Q-value etc) could
be particularly signiﬁcant in the formation of the primary
fragments and in the decay process. The capture cross
section is calculated within the Hill-Wheeler formula and
the barrier distribution approach [27].

The distribution probability is obtained by solving a
set of master equations numerically in the potential en-
ergy surface of the DNS. The time evolution of the dis-
tribution probability P (Z1, N1, E1, t)for fragment 1 with
proton number Z1 and neutron number N1 and with ex-
citation energy E1 is described by the following master
equations:

In the relaxation process of the relative motion, the
DNS will be excited by the dissipation of the relative
kinetic energy. The local excitation energy is determined
by the dissipation energy from the relative motion and
the potential energy surface of the DNS as

The entrance channel quantities {αEN } include the

gles being ZP , NP , ZT , NT , J, R, βP , βT , θP , θT for
projectile and target nuclei. The excitation energy E1 for
fragment (Z1,N1) is evaluated by E1 = ε∗(t = τint)A1/A.
The interaction time τint is obtained from the deﬂection
function method [28].

The DNS fragments satisfy the relation of Z1 + Z2 = Z

The symbol α denotes the sign of the quantities Z1, N1,
Z2, N2, J, R, β1, β2, θ1, θ2. The B(Zi, Ni)(i = 1, 2)
and B(Z, N ) are the negative binding energies of the
fragment (Zi, Ni) and the compound nucleus (Z, N ), re-
spectively. The V CN
is the rotation energy of the com-
rot
pound nucleus. The βi represent the quadrupole defor-
mations of the two fragments. The θi denote the angles
between the collision orientations and the symmetry axes
of the deformed nuclei. The interaction potential be-
tween fragments (Z1, N1) and (Z2, N2) includes the nu-
clear, Coulomb, and centrifugal parts [25]. The radial
distance R between the centers of the two fragments is
chosen to be the value that gives the minimum of the
interaction potential, in which the DNS is considered to
be formed. Shown in Fig. 1 is the PES in the reac-
tion 40Ca+248Cm. The incident points of projectile and
target nuclides are indicated. The nucleon transfer is
coupled to the dissipation of relative motion energy and
angular momentum starting from the entrance channel.
The larger shell correction energy leads to the pocket ap-
pearance in the PES. The positive local excitation energy
enables the nucleon transition in the valence space. The
transition probability is determined by the PES. There-
fore, the structure eﬀects of the fragment production in
the MNT reactions are embodied in the PES.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the DNS model, the nuclear structure eﬀects are
implemented in the PES, such as the shell eﬀect, odd-
even phenomena etc. The dissipation of the collective
degrees of freedom is coupled to the nucleon transfer at
the touching conﬁguration of two fragments. There is no
neck formation in the process of two nuclei approaching.
The evolutions of mass and charge distributions of frag-
ments produced in the multinucleon transfer reactions
of 48Ca+124Sn are shown in Fig. 2 at the barrier en-
ergy (VC =111.4 MeV). The reaction system undergoes
from the individual nuclei to the broad distributions of
projectile-like and target-like fragments with increasing
the relaxation time. The new isotopes might be created

during the transfer process. The yields are enhanced
around the shell closure and the odd-even eﬀect is pro-
nounced.

As a test of the approach, the projectile-like fragments
(PLFs) in the multinucleon transfer reaction 40Ca+124Sn
at the energy of 128.5 MeV are calculated and compared
with the available data [29] as shown in Fig. 3. The iso-
topes of calcium and potassium are underestimated be-
cause of the loss of quasielastic scattering in the model.
The yield peaks are produced with neutron-rich nuclei
because of the isospin equilibrium, such as 37Cl, 36S, 33P
and 30Si. The reactions with neutron-rich nuclide 48Ca
at the energy of 125.4 MeV (VC =111.4 MeV) are investi-
gated as shown in Fig. 4. The experimental data [30] are
nicely reproduced. Comparison of the target-like frag-
ments (TLFs) in the two reaction systems are shown in
Fig. 5. The 40Ca induced reactions are available for the

3

neutron-deﬁcient nuclide production. The projectile pro-
ton stripping enables the formation of heavy fragments.
The smaller neutron separation energies of neutron-rich
nuclides produced in the multinucleon transfer reactions
decreases the survival of the neutron-rich fragments. The
neutron shell closure is available for stabilizing the frag-
ments, i.e., possibly producing 136Xe in the multinucleon
transfer reaction of 48Ca+124Sn. Further experiments
for checking the shell eﬀect in the transfer reactions are
expected.

The MNT mechanism has been further investigated
with the actinide nuclei based reactions. The system of
48Ca+248Cm was used to produce the neutron-deﬁcient
nuclei, i.e., the new isotopes 216U, 219Np, 223Am, 229Am
and 233Bk [31]. The investigations are particularly in-
teresting for checking the shell evolution in the domain
of proton-rich nuclei besides the new isotope synthesis.
Shown in Fig. 6 is the fragment distributions formed in
the MNT reactions of 40Ca, 40Ar, 58Ni+232Th at the en-
ergies of 190 MeV (VC =192.2 MeV), 166 MeV (VC =166.3
MeV) and 256 MeV (VC =255.1 MeV), respectively. The
target-like fragments are produced towards the proton-
rich side, in particular with the 58Ni induced reactions.
The 40Ar+232Th reaction is favorable for producing the
more neutron-rich heavy nuclei because of loosely bound
properties for the nuclide 40Ar. The entrance channel ef-
fects in the MNT reactions have been further investigated
in the 40Ca, 58Ni+238U as shown in Fig. 7 and 40Ca, 48Ca
and 58Ni bombarding 248Cm as shown in Fig. 8 around
the barrier energies. It should be noticed that the 58Ni
induced reactions have the broader isotope distributions
and would be a nice candidate nuclide for creating the
new proton-rich actinide nuclei. The neutron-rich projec-
tile nuclei are available for producing the more neutron-
rich heavy nuclei. The pick-up reactions are more eas-
ily in collisions of 40Ca+238U/248Cm, which enable the
larger cross sections for the proton-rich nucleus formation
via transferred nucleons from target.

The structure of isotope products in the MNT reac-
tions is related to the beam energy. More energy can be
dissipated into the DNS with increasing the incident en-
ergy of colliding system, which leads to the higher local
excitation energy and the larger yields of primary frag-
ments. The excited primary fragments proceed with the
deexcitation by evaporating light particles and ﬁssion. It
was found that the total mass and charge distributions
of the survival fragments around the shell closure N=126
weakly depend on the bombarding energy in the MNT
reaction of 136Xe+198Pt [32]. The isotopic distributions
are further investigated as shown in Fig. 9 in collisions of
58Ni+248Cm. The c.m. energies of 243 MeV, 271.2 MeV
and 324.3 MeV are selected to be below, close to and
above the Coulomb barrier (VC =269.5 MeV), respec-
tively. The production cross sections of isotopes from U
to Es are quite diﬀerent with varying the beam energy. It
is interest to be noticed that the energy just around the
barrier is optimal in the transfer reactions. The higher
beam energy leads to the smaller survival probabilities of

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the multinucleon transfer reactions near
Coulomb barrier energies have been investigated within
the framework of the DNS model, in which the nucleon
transfer takes place after the capture stage of two collid-
ing partners. The all possible orientations in the trans-

fer dynamics are included by the barrier distribution ap-
proach. The available experimental data of transferred
fragments can be nicely reproduced. The isospin dissipa-
tion in the nucleon transfer, relative motion energy and
angular momentum relaxation contributes the fragment
production away from the β-stability. The shell structure
and odd-even eﬀects play a signiﬁcant role on the frag-
