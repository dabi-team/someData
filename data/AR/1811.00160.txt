To study how Andreev reﬂection (AR) is aﬀected by itinerant antiferromagnetism, we perform d-
wave AR spectroscopy with superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−δ on TiAu and on variously-oxidized Nb
(NbOx) samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is also used on the latter to measure their surface
oxide composition. Below the N´eel temperatures (TN ) of both TiAu and NbOx, the conductance
spectra show a dip-like structure instead of a zero-bias peak within the superconducting energy gap;
for NbOx, higher-oxidized samples show a stronger spectral dip at zero bias. These observations
indicate that itinerant antiferromagnetic order suppresses the AR process. Interestingly, the spectral
dip persists above TN for both TiAu and NbOx, implying that spin ﬂuctuations can also suppress
AR. Our results suggest that d-wave AR spectroscopy may be used to probe the degree of spin
ordering in itinerant antiferromagnets.

There is general interest in the interplay of super-
conductivity and itinerant magnetism, both on a fun-
damental level and for technological applications [1, 2].
At a normal-metal/superconductor (N/S) interface, An-
dreev reﬂection (AR) is the process that converts elec-
trons into Cooper pairs through retro-reﬂection of holes
[3, 4]. There has been a considerable amount of theo-
retical and experimental work on AR in itinerant ferro-
magnet/superconductor interfaces [1, 5–12], where AR
has been utilized to probe spin-polarization. In contrast,
there has been very little work on AR for itinerant anti-
ferromagnet/superconductor (IAFM/S) interfaces, aside
[13–15]. However,
from the theoretical work in Refs.
there are topics of fundamental and applied importance
that motivate study of such interfaces. For example, the
interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconduc-
tivity is thought to be important in the high critical tem-
perature (Tc) superconducting cuprates [16–18], and in
the high-Tc iron-pnictides there is thought to be coexis-
tence of superconducting and spin-density wave (SDW)
states [2, 19]. On the technological side, Josephson junc-
tions involving IAFMs are predicted to exhibit unique
properties [20], and it is desirable to ﬁnd new probes to
characterize IAFMs, e.g.
to use for antiferromagnetic
spintronics applications [21, 22].

There has been recent theoretical work for AR onto
IAFMs, and in particular, AR with d-wave superconduc-
tors (dSCs) [13–15]. In analogy with AR in N/S junc-
tions, a N/IAFM junction is predicted to exhibit a spin-
dependent Q-reﬂection, whereby the SDW gap ∆SDW in
the IAFM plays the role of the superconducting gap.
In Q-reﬂection, quasiparticles with energy E < ∆SDW
and momentum kF incident upon the IAFM undergo a
spin-dependent retroreﬂection into states with momen-
tum kF + Q, where Q is the AFM wavevector [14, 15]. If
Q-reﬂection is combined with AR in an dSC/IAFM junc-

tion, a variety of low-energy interfacial bound states are
predicted to form, showing up as peaks in the diﬀerential
conductance spectrum.

d-wave AR spectroscopy using

superconducting
YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) tips and ﬁlms is potentially a
powerful technique for probing IAFMs, as it is expected
to give spin-sensitive information on electronic states at
the sub-nanometer length scale over a wide tempera-
ture range (∼ 0 − 90 K) [12, 23]. The sensitivity to
spin polarization of such d-wave AR measurements was
demonstrated with nanoscale YBCO point contacts on
both Au and CrO2, the latter showing suppression of
d-wave AR as expected for a half-metallic ferromagnet
[12], and recently with non-contact tip-sample junctions
onto another half-metallic ferromagnet La2/3Ca1/3MnO3
(LCMO), which also showed suppression of d-wave AR
[23].

In this work, we perform d-wave AR spectroscopy
with superconducting YBCO to probe itinerant antifer-
romagnetism in two systems. One system is TiAu, a
recently-discovered IAFM with no magnetic constituents
[27]. The other system is the Nb oxides (NbOx), which
have tunable antiferromagnetic order [26] and potentially
itinerant antiferromagnetism [28], both arising from oxy-
gen vacancies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
is also used on the latter to measure their surface ox-
ide composition. Below the N´eel temperatures (TN ) of
both TiAu and NbOx, the conductance spectra show a
dip-like structure instead of a zero-bias peak within the
superconducting energy gap; for NbOx, higher-oxidized
samples show a stronger spectral dip at zero bias. These
observations indicate that itinerant antiferromagnetic or-
der suppresses the AR process. Interestingly, the spectral
dip persists above TN for both TiAu and NbOx, implying
that spin ﬂuctuations can also suppress AR. Our results
suggest that d-wave AR spectroscopy may be used to

probe the degree of spin ordering in itinerant antiferro-
magnets.

TiAu antiferromagnetically orders below 36 K, and
XPS data suggests that Ti is close to its non-magnetic
4+ oxidation state, ruling out the presence of local mo-
ments [27]. Muon spin-relaxation data indicates 100%
volume fraction of magnetic order at 0 K and strong spin-
ﬂuctuations, but the exact role and strength of the latter
are not currently known. Neutron diﬀraction measure-
ments indicate long-range antiferromagnetic order, with
a small itinerant moment of 0.15 µB per Ti atom. The
fact that TiAu has no magnetic constituents deﬁes exist-
ing theories [27].

The most stable of NbOx, Nb2O5, is electrically insu-
lating when pure. However, it tends to have local oxygen
vacancies [29, 30], creating local moments via Nb4+ ions.
Additionally, the constituent NbO6 octahedra of Nb2O5
can accommodate extended oxygen vacancies via crys-
tallographic shear [31, 32], forming several ordered and
non-stoichiometric Nb2O5−x compounds (table I). As x
increases in Nb2O5−x, electrical conductivity and anti-
ferromagnetic coupling between local moments increase,
until ﬁnally Nb12O29 antiferromagnetically orders with a
N´eel temperature of 12 K. Of the Nb2O5−x compounds,
only Nb12O29 is metallic, and it is generally believed that
some of its Nb4+ sites have localized magnetic electrons,
while other sites have itinerant and non-magnetic elec-
trons [26, 33, 34]. However, Nb12O29 may also be an
IAFM, as recent work suggests its antiferromagnetism
comes from delocalized electrons [28].

Proslier and Cao et al. recently studied the inﬂuence
of Nb2O5 on the superconductivity of Nb using XPS,
point-contact tunneling (PCT) with normal-metal tips,
and magnetic susceptibility measurements on NbOx sam-
ples [35–39]. Their PCT spectra showed signs of antifer-
romagnetic exchange-scattering between tunneling elec-
trons and local moments in oxygen-deﬁcient Nb2O5, as
described by the Anderson-Appelbaum theory [40–42].
Magnetic susceptibility vs.
temperature measurements
on these same samples showed Curie-Weiss-like temper-
ature dependence with positive Curie temperatures, also

indicating antiferromagnetic coupling [38, 39]. The suc-
cess of these normal-metal tip PCT studies in detecting
signatures of antiferromagnetism motivates us to extend
them to using superconducting d-wave YBCO tips, where
the high Tc of 90 K allows spin ordering to be probed over
a wide temperature range.

In the present work, d-wave AR spectroscopy mea-
surements were made using point-contact and scanning
tunneling spectroscopy geometries. These measurements
were made using a home-built 4He dipper-probe scanning
tunneling microscope (STM), designed to allow tip and
sample loading within a glovebox ﬁlled with dry N2 gas.
Measurement electronics are described elsewhere [23, 43].
XPS measurements were performed with a PHI 5500 an-
alytical chamber using monochromated Al Kα radiation
of 1486.7 eV at a take-oﬀ angle of 75◦ (for details see Ref.
[44]).

The YBCO single crystals used as tips were grown us-
ing the self-ﬂux technique [45]. The preparation of the
crystals for use as a tip is described elsewhere [23]. The
Nb tips were cut from 0.25mm diameter wire and were
passively oxidized by leaving in air for an hour. The
Nb foils used as samples were 25 µm thick and of 99.8%
purity. The Nb ﬁlms used as samples were 30-200 nm
thick and were grown on natively-oxidized Si wafers by
sputtering. To provide a control sample for AR mea-
surements, 40 nm thick Ag ﬁlms were grown on mica
by sputtering. Natively-oxidized Nb samples were re-
duced either by sputtering with 0.5-3 keV Ar ions in a
background pressure of 0.1 µTorr, or annealing between
880-930 ◦C under a vacuum of 2-4 µTorr for 25-105 hours.
Immediately following each reduction treatment, samples
were kept in a dry N2 environment before quickly being
mounted either onto the STM inside the glovebox for AR
spectroscopy measurements, or into a vacuum chamber
for XPS measurements. The (110)-YBCO ﬁlms were 100
nm thick and grown by pulsed laser deposition on (110)-
(LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2TaAlO6)0.7 (LSAT) substrates, and were
similarly transported in an N2 ﬁlled container before be-
ing loaded onto the STM.

The TiAu polycrystals were grown by arcmelting [27],

and were cut into ∼ 5 x 5 x 2 mm3 slabs for use as a
sample, or ∼ 1 x 1 x 5 mm3 bars for use as a tip. The
slabs were polished to a mirror ﬁnish, cleaned with Ar
ion sputtering, then quickly transferred to an N2 ﬁlled
glovebox, where they were loaded onto the STM. The
bars were broken inside the glovebox to expose a fresh
edge, before being mounted onto the STM. Since both
TiAu and Nb have chemically reactive surfaces at room
temperature in air, various tip/sample combinations were
measured.

We ﬁrst demonstrate control over the surface oxide
composition of NbOx with XPS, which is sensitive to the
top ∼10 nm of our samples’ surfaces [47]. Figure 1 shows
XPS measurements of the Nb 3d core level. Panels (a)
and (b) show that the surface of both natively-oxidized
foils and ﬁlms is predominately Nb2O5, as expected. The
ﬁlm data show asymmetric Nb peaks, indicating the pres-

ence of lower Nb oxidation states beneath the surface
Nb2O5, as shown schematically in panel (g) and reported
by others [46]. Note that it is diﬃcult to distinguish
stoichiometric Nb2O5 from non-stoichiometric Nb2O5−x
compounds with XPS [34], since the predominant ox-
idation state is +5 in all compounds. Nevertheless,
in practice numerous oxygen vacancies exist in Nb2O5
[29, 30, 38], so our large Nb2O5 peaks suggest that a com-
bination of Nb2O5, non-stoichiometric Nb2O5−x com-
pounds, and locally oxygen-deﬁcient Nb2O5 are present
in our samples.

FIG. 3. Normalized point-contact spectra taken between
YBCO and both NbOx and TiAu. For comparison, a spec-
trum for a YBCO tip onto an Ag ﬁlm is also shown. Both the
Nb and TiAu samples show a strong ZBC dip, in contrast to
the ZBC peak in the YBCO-Ag spectrum.

The XPS spectra in ﬁgures 1(c) and (d) show that
sputtering with 3 keV Ar ions shifts spectral weight from
Nb2O5 to lower Nb oxidation states, reducing the ﬁlm
more than the foil. Ar-sputtering oxidized Nb is believed
to both preferentially remove oxygen from Nb2O5 and
diﬀuse oxygen into bulk Nb [48], thickening the lower ox-
idation states beneath the surface as shown schematically
in panel (h). Panels (e) and (f) show that vacuum anneal-
ing has a similar eﬀect as Ar-sputtering: heating oxidized
Nb to ∼ 900 ◦C in low oxygen partial pressures diﬀuses
oxygen atoms from Nb2O5 into bulk Nb, while tempera-
tures above 1600 ◦C are needed to completely evaporate
the oxygen [49]. These XPS data clearly demonstrate
that we can signiﬁcantly thin the native Nb2O5 surface
layer of Nb samples with Ar-sputtering and vacuum an-
nealing.

Next, we show that the reduction treatments in ﬁg-
ure 1(c)-(f) enhance AR. Figure 2(a) shows point-contact
spectra taken with YBCO tips on Nb samples oxidized
similarly to those in ﬁgure 1, where the data colors match
between the two ﬁgures. The depth of the ZBC dip in
ﬁgure 2(a) and the Nb2O5 spectral weight in ﬁgure 1
are clearly correlated. Reduced samples occasionally ex-
hibit ZBC peaks (stars), suggesting spatial variation of
the surface oxide composition in the reduced samples.
The point-contact spectrum for the 0.5 keV Ar-sputtered
ﬁlm (squares) shows a higher ZBC than the 3 keV Ar-
sputtered ﬁlm (triangles), consistent with lower-energy
Ar ions more eﬀectively reducing Nb2O5 [48]. Estimates
of the tip-sample junction sizes using the Wexler formula
[50] show that all junctions are ballistic [51], indicating
that the ZBC features in ﬁgure 2(a) are not due to junc-
tion imperfections.

FIG. 4. Tunneling spectra taken between YBCO and TiAu,
as well as a reference PtIr tip-(110) YBCO ﬁlm spectrum,
shifted for clarity. The TiAu-YBCO spectra show a ZBC
peak of comparable height as the PtIr-YBCO spectrum.

To conﬁrm that the ZBC dips in ﬁgure 2(a) are from
AR suppression, we compare raw point-contact spectra
taken on a Ag ﬁlm and an Ar-sputtered Nb foil in ﬁgures
2(b) and (c), respectively. The YBCO-Ag data show a
prominent zero-bias conductance (ZBC) peak, ﬂanked by
weak peaks near ± 20 mV. Similar ZBC peaks have been
observed in a variety of point-contact studies on YBCO,
primarily on crystal faces not normal to a principal crys-
tal axis, and attributed to d-wave Andreev resonance [52].
As for the side peaks, their energies are comparable to
the superconducting gap maximum of YBCO [53–55]. A
quasi-linear conductance background is also present, as
commonly observed for YBCO and other cuprates [56–
58]. The YBCO-Nb foil data show similar features, ex-
cept a ZBC dip is present instead of a ZBC peak. The
temperature dependence of the ZBC features in these
junctions is shown in their respective insets, which were
extracted from the normalized data in panels (d) and (e).
As temperature increases, the ZBC features weaken and
ﬁnally disappear above YBCO’s Tc of 90 K, conﬁrming
that they are related to AR.

We next show that similar point-contact spectra are
obtained with natively-oxidized Nb tips on (110)-oriented
YBCO ﬁlms, as well as TiAu tip-YBCO ﬁlm junctions.
Figure 3 shows normalized point-contact spectra taken
between YBCO and both TiAu and oxidized Nb sam-
ples. Both the Nb oxides (squares and triangles) and
TiAu (pentagons) exhibit a strong ZBC dip, in contrast
to the ZBC peak in the YBCO-Ag spectrum (circles).
The stronger ZBC dip for the Nb tip-YBCO ﬁlm spec-
trum (triangles) compared to the YBCO tip-Nb foil spec-
trum (squares) is consistent with the diﬀerent prepara-
tion procedures used for Nb. That is, when used as a ﬁlm
it was sputtered with 3 keV Ar ions, which XPS showed
to signiﬁcantly thin the native Nb2O5 layer (ﬁgure 1d).

action of AR and Q-reﬂection in d-wave superconduc-
tor/IAFM (dSC/IAFM) junctions, as described in Refs.
[14, 15]. For no interfacial tip/sample barrier, the ZBC
peak from d-wave Andreev resonance is predicted to be
suppressed [14], in which the quasiparticles Q-reﬂected
from the IAFM can re-enter the dSC and disrupt the An-
dreev resonance. This disruption of AR initially would
seem to agree with our observed ZBC dips. However,
a ﬁnite interfacial barrier is present in all experimen-
tal junctions, and such junctions are predicted to show
ZBC peaks as well as asymmetric peaks at other energies
[14], in disagreement with our data. This disagreement is
likely related to discrepancies between the assumptions
used in the theoretical work in Ref. [14] and our measure-
ments—namely, the orientation of the IAFM lattice with
respect to the sample normal direction, and the relative
size of the magnetic and superconducting order parame-
ters in the IAFM and dSC, respectively. Regardless, our
observed sensitivity of d-wave AR to itinerant antifer-
romagnetism in point-contact junctions is qualitatively
consistent with the Q-reﬂection mechanism. Theoret-
ical models that allow for arbitrary orientation of the
IAFM lattice with respect to the sample normal direc-
tion would help in more accurately modeling our point-
contact data. Considering that the energies of the afore-
mentioned asymmetric peaks are predicted to depend on
the size of the magnetic order parameter in the IAFM,
such theoretical models could potentially be utilized to
extract quantitative information about the antiferromag-
netic ordering in IAFMs from point-contact measure-
ments like ours.

In understanding our YBCO-NbOx point-contact and
tunneling spectra, one factor to consider is the Nb12O29
content in the NbOx samples, since the former is the only
Nb oxide that is a candidate IAFM. On the one hand,
while our NbOx samples likely have regions of Nb12O29,
they are certainly not pure Nb12O29, as shown by our
XPS data and noting that a speciﬁc annealing procedure
is required to isolate this compound in bulk form [26].
However, since Nb12O29 is the most conductive oxide [59]
in table I, our YBCO-NbOx junctions are likely preferen-
tially probing Nb12O29 regions. Furthermore, since AR
is only known to be sensitive to itinerant moments, our
AR data are likely preferentially sensitive to Nb12O29.
To clarify whether our YBCO-NbOx data are strongly
inﬂuenced by the presence of other NbOx compounds, it
would be useful to perform point-contact and tunneling
measurements between YBCO and pure Nb12O29 crys-
tals.

One interesting feature of both our TiAu- and NbOx-
YBCO point-contact data is its temperature dependence.
Surprisingly, both types of junctions show AR suppres-
sion all the way up to YBCO’s Tc of 90 K (TiAu also
shows suppression up to Tc, not shown). If the AR sup-
pression was solely due to Q-reﬂection, one would rea-
sonably expect the AR suppression to subside near the

FIG. 5. Tunneling spectra taken between YBCO and NbOx,
as well as a reference YBCO tip-Ag ﬁlm spectrum, shifted
for clarity. The Nb ﬁlm was sputtered with 3 keV Ar ions.
Compared to the YBCO-Ag ﬁlm spectra, the YBCO-NbOx
spectra show strong ZBC peaks, weak ZBC peaks, and ZBC
peaks split by 6-8 mV.

In contrast, when used as a tip the Nb was natively ox-
idized, so it likely had a relatively thick Nb2O5 layer,
similar to the natively-oxidized Nb foil XPS data (ﬁg-
ure 1a). As ﬁgure 2(a) showed, Nb samples with thicker
Nb2O5 layers exhibit stronger AR suppression, consistent
with the above observations.

Having shown that TiAu- and NbOx-YBCO point-
contact junctions exhibit AR suppression, we now exam-
ine conductance spectra from TiAu-YBCO tunnel junc-
tions, shown in ﬁgure 4 along with a reference PtIr-
YBCO junction. The PtIr-YBCO spectrum (triangles)
exhibits a prominent ZBC peak ﬂanked by side peaks
near ± 20 mV, as expected from d-wave Andreev reso-
nance. The TiAu-YBCO data (squares and circles) show
a ZBC peak of similar size to the PtIr-YBCO junction.
The fact that we observe ZBC peaks for TiAu tunnel
junctions indicates that AR suppression is the origin of
the ZBC dip in the YBCO-TiAu point-contact junctions.
Finally, we examine conductance spectra from YBCO-
NbOx tunnel junctions, shown in ﬁgure 5 along with
a reference YBCO-Ag junction. The YBCO-Ag spec-
trum (circles) again exhibits a prominent ZBC peak. The
YBCO-NbOx data (lines and diamonds) show a variety
of ZBC features depending on the tip’s (x, y) position
on the sample, including a strong ZBC peak, weak ZBC
peak, and ZBC peaks split by 6-8 mV. Again, the fact
that we observe ZBC peaks for these NbOx tunnel junc-
tions provides further evidence that AR suppression is
the origin of the ZBC dips in YBCO-NbOx point-contact
junctions.

We now discuss our point-contact AR data, which
show that both TiAu and NbOx suppress d-wave AR.
To understand this suppression, we consider the inter-

N´eel temperature TN of TiAu (36 K) and Nb12O29 (12
K). Thus, our observed AR suppression above TN implies
that antiferromagnetic ordering is not necessary to sup-
press AR. Rather, spin ﬂuctuations may be able to sup-
press AR. Spin ﬂuctuations are thought to be important
in IAFMs [60], and indeed, the low TN and small moment
of 0.15 µB in TiAu are consistent with the presence of
spin ﬂuctuations [27]. To investigate the sensitivity of
d-wave AR to spin ﬂuctuations, it might be useful to ex-
tend the models from Refs. [14, 15] to include the eﬀects
of disorder in the AFM lattice. For NbOx, if Nb12O29
is indeed an IAFM, then spin ﬂuctuations would likely
also be important. Furthermore, the local moments from
oxygen vacancies in Nb2O5 are known to be sources of
localized charge and spin [35–38] and can antiferromag-
netically exchange-scatter tunneling electrons, which has
been measured up to 40 K and is expected to persist to
higher temperatures [38, 39]. While it is not experimen-
tally established that AR is aﬀected by local moments,
it seems plausible that AR could be upset via spin-ﬂip
eﬀects from local moments. More theoretical work is
needed to investigate this possibility.

Our tunnel junctions involving TiAu show no AR sup-
pression, which is qualitatively consistent with the Q-
reﬂection work in Refs. [13–15]. Namely, the ZBC peak
from d-wave Andreev resonance is only predicted to be
suppressed in IAFM/dSC junctions with no interfacial
barrier, in which the Q-reﬂected quasiparticles in the
IAFM can re-enter the dSC and disrupt the Andreev res-
onance. For tunnel junctions with large interfacial barri-
ers, the re-entrance of the Q-reﬂected quasiparticles into
the dSC is expected to be negligible, and thus, the IAFM
would have little eﬀect on the ZBC peak height, consis-
tent with our data. In contrast to TiAu, tunnel junctions
involving NbOx data show variation in AR suppression,
exhibiting ZBC peaks of varying heights as well as ZBC
peaks split by 6-8 mV. This spectral variation is consis-
tent with spatial variation of the surface oxide composi-
tion. That is, since tunnel junctions are atomic-scale [23]
compared to ∼ nm-scale point-contact junctions, tunnel
junctions can more easily ﬁnd regions with less Nb2O5−x
where AR can apparently occur more robustly. However,
it is not obvious in the ﬁrst place why NbOx would cause
weakened or split ZBC peaks for tunnel junctions. The
split peaks are not due to the SC gap of Nb ∆Nb, since
∆Nb ∼ 1 meV and thermally broadens to only 2.5 mV
(e.g. see Ref.
In any case, the peak separation
is 6-8 mV for both NbOx tip-YBCO sample and YBCO
tip-NbOx sample combinations, indicating that it is not
sensitive to sample preparation procedure. Since the split
and weakened peaks are only observed for NbOx and not
TiAu, it would seem they are related to local oxygen va-
cancies. To check this observation, it would again be use-
ful to perform tunneling measurements between YBCO
and pure Nb12O29. If the split and weakened ZBC peaks
were due to local oxygen vacancies, pure Nb12O29 would

exhibit no such peaks.

In summary, we have used d-wave AR spectroscopy
with YBCO to probe itinerant antiferromagnetism in
TiAu and NbOx samples. XPS was also used on the
latter to measure their surface oxide composition. For
NbOx, samples with a greater degree of oxidation exhib-
ited greater suppression of d-wave AR. For both TiAu
and NbOx,
low-impedance tip-sample junctions sup-
pressed AR more than high-impedance junctions. Fur-
thermore, AR suppression was observed above the N´eel
temperature in both compounds, implying that spin ﬂuc-
tuations can suppress d-wave AR. Our data demonstrate
that d-wave AR is suppressed by itinerant antiferromag-
netism, and suggest that d-wave AR spectroscopy may
be utilized as a nanoscale probe to gauge the degree of
spin ordering in IAFMs.

[47] & 95% of photoelectrons come from within 3 inelastic
mean free paths of the sample surface. Using the 1486.7
eV energy of Al Kα x-rays, the inelastic mean free path
of photoelectrons in our samples ranges from 2.5 nm in
Nb to 3.9 nm in Nb2O5, calculated using the expressions
from Ref. [61].

[51] The resistance R of a point-contact can be related to the
contact’s radius a with the Wexler formula [50]: R =
4ρℓ/(3πa2) + ρ/2a, where ρ is electrical resistivity and ℓ
is electronic mean free path. For our R of 0.15-100 kΩ,
we use YBCO’s ℓ of 10 nm and normal state ρ of 50 µΩ
cm [53] to estimate that a ≈0.2-5 nm, well below 10 nm.
