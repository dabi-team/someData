Abstract

The thermal accommodation coeﬃcient α has been assumed, although lacking any experimental proof, to

be near unity for most gases so far, which denotes no inﬂuence. However, it plays a contributing role in the

ﬁeld of the eﬀective thermal conductivity of highly porous insulation materials based on SiO2 or CaSiO3

as it is shown in this work. Besides, this work investigates a possible inﬂuence on α for Ar, N2, He within

parameters like temperature, roughness and contamination as this has not been examined on such materials

so far. More importantly, it answers the question whether the assumption of α = 1 is valid.

By using a parallel plates device, very similar to the guarded-hot-plate, following EN 12667 it was possible

to determine α on a dense CaSiO3. It occured that the assumptions α = 1 (for Ar, N2) and α = 0.3 (for

He) are valid for measurements near room temperature. Further, physical adsorption was found to increase

α. The determination of the inﬂuence of roughness has been started showing an interesting eﬀect, but it still

remains an open topic.

In a collaborative study molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed showing a strong equivalence

of α between SiO2 and CaSiO3. These results can be considered a lower limit of α as neither roughness nor

adsorption processes have been included in the simulation. Therefore, any deviations between experiments

and MD could be considered as an apperance of physical adsorption.

1. Introduction

Facing today’s need for increased energy eﬃciencies of industrial processes, the thermophysical properties

of insulating materials have evoked great interest for decades. Especially new kinds of insulation materials

like aerogels or highly porous calcium silicates (CaSiO3) show promise in reducing heat transfer due to

their high porosity and pore sizes in the micro and meso range [1]. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of

understanding of heat transfer due to the very heterogeneous structure of such materials. Some eﬀorts were

made by Swimm [2] who developed a model for the description of heat transfer in such materials. Following

Swimm [2] it can be shown that with the usual parallel and series connection of the various heat transfer

mechanisms (solid and gas conduction, radiation) the eﬀective thermal conductivity was expected to be lower

than the experimental results indicated. With introduction of a coupling factor dependent on the material,

their model reﬂects real-world experimental results.

One detail of the model of Swimm [1] or others (e.g. Zhao [3]), which remains unveriﬁed until now and may

be questioning the models of the eﬀective thermal conductivity, is the inﬂuence of the thermal accommoda-

tion coeﬃcient α within the gas conduction, which is assumed to be unity for porous insulation materials so

far [1, 3, 4]. In literature, merely few results are available for silicium oxide (SiO2, amorphous [5], quartz

[6]) and none for calcium silicate providing only a weak basis for the models of the eﬀective thermal con-

ductivity. Therefore, the goal of this work is to shed light on the situation of the thermal accommodation

coeﬃcient on amorphous SiO2 and CaSiO3 as they usually are the main components in conventional and

highly porous insulation materials. More importantly, it provides the necessary basis of whether α = 1 is

valid. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of temperature, roughness and contamination is examined.

As the experimental determination of the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient is always inﬂuenced by con-

tributing factors (e.g. surface roughness, adsorption layers), which leads usually to an increase of the thermal

accommodation coeﬃcient, a collaborative study using molecular dynamics (MD) was done for comparison to

get a more detailed look onto the situation at an atomistic level. This gives a ﬁrst hint, in what range of values

α could be expected, as the results of MD can be considered as the lower limit of the thermal accommodation

coeﬃcient on amorphous SiO2 and CaSiO3. Using MD, many studies have been conducted previously to

determine the accommodation coeﬃcient values for diﬀerent solid-gas molecule combinations (e. g. amor-

phous silica aerogels [7] or amorphous polystyrene [8], crystal [9]). However, the study of Zichunyang et al [7]

neglects the inﬂuence of the attractive forces of the solid atoms between neighboring nanoparticle interfaces.

As explained above, Swimm [2] was able to clearly show that a coupling factor has to be introduced in

order to represent this improved heat transfer. Due to the neighboring nanoparticle interfaces the attractive

forces tend to overlap and increase, which leads to a higher adsorption potential and thus to a higher value

of α. Apart from predicting the values of α, the inﬂuence of surface roughness [10], gas-wall interaction

strength [11, 12, 9], gas molecular mass [12, 13] and gas temperature [13] on α have also been studied using

MD. Higher solid wall surface roughness increases the number of gas-wall collisions through interaction of

2

gas molecules with the lateral edges of the solid atoms [9], thus increasing α values. Therefore, MD has

shown to be a very good, although also very time-consuming tool, for completing the picture of thermal

accommodation coeﬃcients on solid surfaces in comparison to experimental observations.

The paper is structured as follows: First, an overall description of the examined insulation materials is given

as well as a short summary of the setup of the experimental device. After this a brief description of the MD

is given. The ﬁnal comparison and discussion with experimental and MD results will be presented at last.

2. Characterization of Porous Media

The materials which were examined are conventional highly porous insulation materials for high temperature

usage purposes as well as sintered samples composed of SiO2 and CaSiO3 (see Table 1 for composition).

The pore size, that shows major eﬀects on the pressure dependent eﬀective thermal conductivity λef f [1],

ranges from macropores for the porous calcium silicates with a sharp pore size distribution to macro- and

mesopores for the porous silicium oxides with a broad pore size distribution. During the experiments the

Knudsen eﬀect, where λef f begins to develop a pressure-dependency [14], appeared by lowering the pressure.

Measurements of the surface roughness (Rz) revealed no clear correlation between porosity and roughness,

although all highly porous samples were treated the same way (trimming). Sample CaSiO3 D1 was polished

with a diamond abrasive paper, but didn’t show any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in roughness in comparison to the

other samples.

All samples are 100 mm in diameter with a height of 5-7 mm. Four thermocouples boreholes (ø 1.1 mm) were

drilled horizontally to minimize heat losses by leading the thermocouples along isotherms.

Concerning the preparation of the sintered sample (CaSiO3 D1, wollastonite) the following procedure has

been performed: 250 g wollastonite1 Casiﬂux (Sibelco) and 2.5 g TiO2 R 320 (Sachtleben) (used as a sintering

aid) were mixed with 100 g deionized water for at least 1 hour. In order to obtain a castable slurry, additives

were added to the slurry: 2.5 g Optapix AC 170 (Zschimmer & Schwarz, Germany), 0.5 g Axilat RH 50

MD (C.H. Erbsl¨oh, Germany), and 1 g Castament F60 (BASF Construction Solutions GmbH, Trostber,

Germany). The Optapix AC 170 was used as a binder, the Castament F60 acted as dispersant and the

Axilat were added to change the dilatant behavior of the slurry to obtain a shear thinning behavior which is

necessary for the casting process. The slurry was cast into the casting mold, which is basically of the same

form as the porous samples (ø 100 mm, height 7 mm). The sample was dried carefully at 50℃ and sintered

at 1200℃ for 3 hours. The porosity is assumed to be signiﬁcantly lower (less 5%) than for the other porous

samples.

3. Experimental Setup and Mathematical Foundation

For the determination of thermal accommodation coeﬃcients on amorphous SiO2 and CaSiO3 a measure-

ment device similar to the well-known steady-state guarded-hot-plate device [15] with parallel plates was

developed and built. It will be presented in the following. After this a more detailed description of the test

procedure and the extraction of the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient from experimental measurements are

given.

3.1. Setup

A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. The underlying idea of this method is the use

of guarding heat foils (HK2/3/6) based on superthin polyimide foil (less than 0.2 mm thick) surrounding the

measuring heat foil (HK1) in the center. Thus, an isothermal zone is created to ensure that the heat ﬂow

which is needed for the derivation of the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient is one-dimensional through the

gas gap (2 mm). The temperature diﬀerence over the gas gap is 10 K controlled by the underlying heat foil

(HK4). The gas gap is conﬁned above by a reference sample which is held in place by the upper plate assembly

and below by the ceramic sample which is placed above HK4. Therefore, the thermal accommodation

coeﬃcient of the ceramic material αc is determined in dependence of the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient

of the reference sample αr. The latter is determined during calibration. For thermal separation the upper

plate assembly is held in position by a linear translator which is placed above the vacuum chamber. The

vacuum chamber is cylindrical with a height of 300 mm and a diameter of 200 mm. It can be opened vertically

and it holds a pressure of 10-4 mbar. The essential water-cooled heat sink is placed below heat foil HK4 and

provides the lowest temperature in the system (for more details see [16]).

3.2. Test Procedure and Determination of α

The measurements start with baking-out at 140◦C and evacuation down to the lowest possible pressure

(ca. 10-4 mbar) for at least 12 h. Further the atmosphere is ﬂushed and evacuated twice more very rapidly to

make sure that gas residuals are ﬂushed out of the vacuum chamber. After this atmospheric cleaning process,

four steady-state conditions at diﬀerent pressures are generally reached at a constant temperature of at least

60 minutes, each between 3 - 30 mbar for Ar and N2 as well as 5 - 300 mbar for He. During the measurement

all signals like current and voltage for calculation of the power of HK1 as the heat ﬂow rate applied for

the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient determination, temperature readings of about 30 thermocouples, and

inside pressures are logged every 10 s. The measured pressure value is needed to control the stability of the

gas regime and for the calculation of the Kn-number. Additionally the thermocouples provide an overall

picture of the thermal homogeneity to ensure the validity of the underlying parallel plate principle. In order

to separate the radiation component from the measured heat ﬂow, the radiation is estimated and subtracted

from the measured heat ﬂow. A measurement at very low pressures without any inﬂuences of gas thermal

conduction was not possible, as will be explained below. (Rev 2, pt 4)

Two phenomena which were observed during calibration led to a conﬁned measurability and will be presented

more in detail in the following as this helps to get an impression on the challenging aspects of this project:

Mutual inﬂuences between HK1 and HK3. The task of HK3 is to provide a ∆T = 0 K (temperature diﬀerence)

next to HK1 as the measuring heat foil. Unfortunately, it turned out that the thermal resistivity of the layer

After testing diﬀerent materials the

best option was to create a larger gas gap of 4 mm (see Figure 1) by using ceramic distance spacers. The idea

for this can be followed in Figure 2, where the well-known S-curve of the pressure dependent gas thermal

conductivity can be seen versus logarithmic pressure: The gas thermal conductivity in the 2 mm gap varies

during the measurement depending on the pressure (blue curve) whereas in the 4 mm gap (green curve) there

is an almost pressure-independent gas thermal conductivity. Thus, only the 2 mm gap gas conduction shows

a pressure-dependent behaviour which is needed to derive the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient. Below

the lower pressure limit an inﬂuence of the pressure-dependent thermal conductivity within the 4 mm gap

starts to develop, which leads to an incorrect measurement of the heat ﬂow of HK1, which is needed for

the derivation of α. This phenomenon therefore deﬁnes a lower pressure limit for the measurability of the

device.

Inﬂuence of convection. Another phenomenon deﬁnes the upper limit of measurability of the device. The

radiation protection shield consists of a very thin metal foil, which is very ﬂexible. Therefore, due to all the

wiring of thermocouples, it is not possible to place the shield in an exact position. By means of numerical

investigations it can be shown that near atmospheric pressure natural convection develops in the annulus.

Since the gap between the radiation protection shield and the thermal insulation below HK4 is not completely

closed, an accelerated ﬂow occurs at the outer edge of HK2, which leads to increased heat losses. Since HK2

has to compensate for this heat loss in order to maintain ∆T = 0 K, the power of HK2 increases. At the

same time, the power of HK1 decreases because it is not exposed to the same heat loss as HK2. Due to this,

the power of HK1 decreases at higher pressures, as can be seen in Figure 2. As the lower and upper limit

are also dependent on the kind of gas, diﬀerent upper pressure limits could be found ranging from 3 mbar

for Ar up to 300 mbar for He.

the closed-form solution of heat conduction in rareﬁed gases between parallel plates developed by Lees and

Liu [18] to arbitrary values of the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient:

accommodation coeﬃcients on the upper/reference and lower/ceramic plate. With the help of Sherman’s

As α is always inﬂuenced by the temperatures of the gas and wall molecules as well as by the composition, the

surface structure and eventual contamination of the wall material, two diﬀerent accommodation coeﬃcients

are present in a parallel plates setup. If the surfaces conﬁning the gas gap are similar (same material and

surface treatment) one can asume: αr,1 = αr,2 = αr. This gives a simpler version of Equation 3:

As observed during measurements the temperature diﬀerence across the gas gap changes due to a pressure-

dependent contact resistance between the heat foil and the sample for the lower plate. Therefore, this

inﬂuence has to be corrected leading to the following equation, which is used for calibration:

By choosing a certain thickness of the gas gap (here: 2 mm) and diﬀerent pressure values the transition and

they are determined equivalently based on Equation 5 or 6, respectively, where αr or αcer is ﬁtted onto the

experimental results with the help of the nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt regression method [20].

4. Molecular Dynamics Study

A setup similar to the experimental one is created and presented below together with a description of the

method used to calculate αcer. Finally, used potentials and parameters, that have been validated with

literature are shown. To validate the used calculation method of αcer on amorphous SiO2 and CaSiO3 the

method was tested with tungsten (W − Ar and W − He), since reliable literature data are available for these.

4.1. Setup

For generating the amorphous structures of SiO2 and CaSiO3, the melt-quench process is followed. The

starting structure is created by randomly distributing 37,500 (CaSiO3 → 7,500 - Ca; 7,500 - Si ; 22,500 -

O) or 38,400 (SiO2 → 12,800 - Si ; 25,600 - O) ions in a box of ≈ 10 x 10 x 5 nm based on the reference

densities [21, 22] with periodic boundary conditions. The time-temperature cycle for the entire melt quench

process considered by Mead [21] (CaSiO3) or Munetoh [22] (SiO2) is followed. Tungsten, with a body

centered cubic structure and same sample dimensions as in the amorphous structure case, is constructed by

orienting the densely packed plane (110) along the z direction of the simulation box. The structures are well

equilibrated at 300 K and at zero pressure in a NPT ensemble for 160 ps. These ﬁnal equilibrated structures

of amorphous SiO2, CaSiO3 and W are used as the solid substrates for their respective simulations (see

Figure 3).
The distance between the upper (hot) and lower (cold) plate is maintained at 100 (cid:6)A for simulations involving
Ar & N2 gas molecules and 1000 (cid:6)A for He gas molecules to maintain the total gas pressure below their
corresponding critical pressures. The solid plates are placed in such a way that the gas interacting surfaces

have identical amorphous surfaces at the top and bottom, i.e. the upper plate is just the mirror copy of

the lower plate about the center of simulation box. Periodic boundary conditions are applied along x, y
and z directions to facilitate the use of PPPM long range solvers. The atoms present within 3.0 (cid:6)A distance

from the outermost layer of walls are ﬁxed to prevent the walls from sliding along the z direction due to
gas pressures. Along the z direction for a distance of 20 (cid:6)A beyond the ﬁxed layers of atoms, vacuum is

maintained to prevent energy exchange between the hot and cold plates across the periodic boundary.

In an equilibrium MD for computing αcer, the temperatures of the hot and cold plates need to be maintained

at a preset temperature throughout the complete production run. Thermosetting the entire solid plates

using a deterministic Nos´e-Hoover (NH) thermostat [23, 24], which can preserve the structural properties,

could be a viable option. But since the energy/momentum exchange between the solid & gas molecules

is the predominant process in this simulation, the NH thermostat preserves the dynamical properties only

under certain circumstances. It is indeed a recommended practice to turn oﬀ the thermostats before the

production run for applications where the dynamical properties are sampled [25]. So, in order to maintain

the temperature and to have the gas-wall interaction region to be more physical by preserving both the

structural as well as the dynamical properties during the production run, the solid plates are split equally

into two regions along the z direction where one region is maintained under micro-canonical (NVE) ensemble

that contains the gas-wall interaction surface and the other maintained under the canonical (NVT) ensem-

ble conditions where the temperatures are controlled using Nos´e-Hoover thermostat throughout the entire

simulation time. An initial equilibration time of 500 ps is allowed for the heat to transfer from the outer to

inner region, such that both the NVT & NVE regions attain the same temperature.

The outer regions of the hot and cold plates are maintained at 350 K and 340 K, respectively, to reﬂect

experimental conditions. Further, the inﬂuence of temperature levels close by (+/-20 K) did not reveal a

great eﬀect on αcer and so this parameter variation is neglected in the following (see Figure 4).

After the equilibration of solid plates, the gas molecules are introduced in-between the plates at random

positions. An appropriate gas molecule density has to be chosen due to the trade-oﬀ involved between in-

creasing the number of gas-wall collisions within the ﬁnite simulation time and maintaining the gas pressure

below the critical pressure. The number of gas molecules to be introduced is determined by considering the

critical pressure of the gases (pcr = 4.86 MPa for Ar, pcr = 0.23 MPa for He, pcr = 3.4 MPa for N2) as the

upper limit and also by taking the Knudsen number (Kn = 0.3 for Ar and N2 and Kn = 0.65 for He) in the

transition ﬂow regime into account.

tion for the velocities, random values are sampled from a Gaussian distribution for each velocity component

with a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation scaled to their respective temperatures.

The gas molecules are maintained under NVE ensemble conditions and 1 ns of simulation time is allowed to

equilibrate the gas temperature. The extraction of the trajectories of gas atoms for computing αcer starts

only after the 1.5 ns of the total equilibration time.

4.2. Calculation of αcer

For computing of αcer, a virtual plane (see Figure 3) is constructed at a distance of one gas-wall interaction

cut oﬀ radius (rc) away from the inner surface of the upper solid wall normal to the z direction, to avoid any

inﬂuence of the attractive forces from the solid wall atoms [10, 11, 13]. Gas atoms crossing the virtual plane

towards the solid wall with positive z velocities (vz > 0) are categorized as incident atoms, which represents

the start of the energy exchange process. The same gas atoms recrossing the virtual plane after having

collided with the solid wall with negative z velocities (vz < 0) are categorized as reﬂected atoms, which

represents the end of the energy exchange process. This is based on the assumption that the probability of

gas-gas collisions within the upper solid wall and the virtual plane region is negligible, i.e. gas atoms crossing

the virtual plane will return back only after having direct collision with the solid wall atoms [13]. Only the

velocities of gas molecules crossing this virtual plane at any time step are considered for calculating αcer.

For the case of monoatomic molecules such as Ar and He, the positional coordinates and velocities of atoms

crossing the virtual plane are directly exported whereas for the case of diatomic molecules such as N2, the

10

positional coordinates and velocities at the geometric center of mass (COM) of the diatomic molecules [7]

are exported and only based on the COM, a molecule is checked whether it has crossed the virtual plane

or not during the simulation. The formula for calculating αcer from Spijker [26], based on the least squares

approximation on the collision data containing incident (KI ) and reﬂected (KR) quantities is given by,

αcer = 1 −

I − (cid:104)KI (cid:105))2

R − (cid:104)KR(cid:105))

(7)

where the summation is performed over all the recorded collisions for the considered quantity (kinetic energy).

To allow a suﬃcient number of gas-wall collisions so as to achieve good statistics for the αcer calculations, the

total simulation time is chosen based on the convergence of the αcer value with respect to simulation time.

All the simulations are performed with a time step of 1 fs (except 0.5 fs for the amorphous SiO2 system)

using the LAMMPS package [27] and post processing & visualization have been done using the open source

visualization tool OVITO [28].

4.3. Interatomic Potentials and Parameters

The interatomic potentials used for the amorphous SiO2, CaSiO3 and W as well as for the gases Ar, He and

N2 are listed in Table 2. The potential expression of CaSiO3 [29] involves a dispersion term in addition to a

long-range Coulombic term and a short-range Morse function. The addition of the repulsive term is necessary

to model interactions at high temperatures and pressures. Simulating using potentials without the repulsive

contribution term for cases where the ions tend to come close enough, i.e. at elevated temperatures and

during interactions with ﬁxed layer of atoms, could be problematic due to the unphysical attraction values at

low inter-ionic distances. For the evaluation of long range Coulombic interactions, a particle-particle-particle

mesh (PPPM) over the standard Ewald summation method is chosen for its computational eﬃciency with
a force norm of less than 10-6 eV/(cid:6)A. To avoid the computation of long range coulombic interactions, a

3-body Tersoﬀ potential for SiO2 [22] over the Beest-Kramer-Santen (BKS) or Morse potential is used.

Lennard-Jones (LJ) [12-6] potential [30] is widely used to model gas-gas and gas-wall interactions. Each
N2 molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor with a ﬁxed bond length of 1.1 (cid:6)A [13]. The parameter values for
gas-wall interactions can be calculated by using the approximation methods like Fender-Halsey (FH) and

Lorentz-Berthelot (LB) mixing rules. Since the LB mixing rule is observed to overestimate the gas-wall atoms

bonding characteristics [11], parameter values in the current simulations are calculated using the FH mixing
rule. Cut-oﬀ radius for gas-gas and gas-wall interactions are 2.5 times σii [11] and 8 (cid:6)A, respectively. The
LJ parameter values chosen for Ca, Si and O atoms are successfully used to study the physical adsorption

behavior of gases on to the amorphous silica, silicate glass surfaces and zeolites [31, 32]. LJ parameter values
(εW-Ar = 0.002168 eV & σW-Ar = 2.93 (cid:6)A) used in the tungsten surface scattering studies [33] are employed
for W − Ar interactions. For W − He, the functional form and parameter values used in tungsten and helium

interaction studies [34] are chosen. The cutoﬀ radii for tungsten-argon and tungsten-helium interactions are

11

6 (cid:6)A and 4 (cid:6)A respectively. All potentials and parameter values are substantially tested and validated with

their corresponding literature.

5. Results

In the following, the results obtained from MD and experiments for validation with W as well as for amor-

phous SiO2 and CaSiO3 are presented.

5.1. Validation with Tungsten - Experiments and Molecular Dynamics

In Figure 5 literature data in comparison with the results from experiments and MD are shown. Basically

the data from literature scatters very much, but some trends are visible. For W − Ar, the desorption

of Ar is evident with a strong decreasing trend with increasing temperature above 87 K, the condensation

temperature of Ar [42]. In contrast, it is evident that there is no decreasing trend for W −He due to the non-

adsorptive behavior of He. Furthermore, literature data varies between 0 to 1 over the entire temperature

range. Usually this behavior is explained with adsorption eﬀects of unknown nature (e.g. Saxena & Joshi

[6]). For the validation with W (red triangles for exp., orange triangles for MD) the results from MD agree

very well with literature data. Therefore, the method to derive the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient from

MD (following Spijker [26]) is validated.

Further, results from the experimental calibration indicate at least chemical adsorption at the W surface

leading to a higher αr. Steinbeck [43] as well as Saxena & Joshi [6] revealed that W creates tungsten oxide as

well as tungsten nitride under the exposure of N2 & O2. Less inﬂuence of adsorption during the calibration

was observed with platinum (P t) conﬁrming the calibration of the measurement device (not shown).

5.2. Molecular dynamics

Results of MD for amorphous SiO2 and CaSiO3 are presented in Figure 6. According to the model of Spijker

[26] the velocities of the incoming and outgoing atoms passing the virtual plane are tracked and used for the

calculation of αcer via a linear least squares approximation. By looking at the resulting plots it might be

obvious that for smaller αcer (e.g. SiO2/CaSiO3-He) the cluster of most points has a more elliptical shape

than for a higher value of αcer where it forms a circle. This is in accordance with Spijker [26]. The limits

of αcer being 0 or 1 present themselves as dashed lines whereas the red line represents the ﬁnal result of

the linear least squares approximation. The slope of the red line gives αcer. Note that with an increasing

slope αcer decreases. Further, it appears that the results are quite equal for SiO2 and CaSiO3 for each gas.

Only with decreasing atomic weight of the gas the deviations of αcer between SiO2 and CaSiO3 increase

signiﬁcantly, but very slightly as with CaSiO3 exhibiting the lower αcer. It is found that the eﬀect of the

and also initializing gas velocities with random seed numbers for the given temperature is found to have a

Several observations can be found from Figure 7:

• It appears that αcer increases as the molar mass of the used gas increases. For He the lowest values of

αcer were achieved as well as for Ar the highest and with N2 in between. This observation is valid for

almost every result except for the experimental results where αcer reaches an equal level for N2 and

Ar.

• The results from MD are lower than the experimental results for all gases. However, the deviations

between experimental and MD results appear to be diﬀerent being lowest for He, highest for N2,

whereas Ar lies in between.

• Further promising results were obtained by Yamaguchi and Suzuki in a collaborative work, who used

a spherical device for the measurement of αcer (for description of the device see [61]). Their results

resemble the experimental data obtained during this work.

• In comparison to literature only those results of Sch¨afer [60] agree with MD and the present experi-

mental results. The data reported by McFall [5] and Sonnick [59] appear to be signiﬁcantly lower for

He and even lower for Ar.

• An evaluation of the standard uncertainty of the experiments revealed very diﬀerent values as the

standard uncertainty for measurements with He reaches up to ±28% whereas with Ar and N2 a

standard uncertainty of ±5% is obtained. (rev 2 pt 3)

Another picture can be drawn from Figure 8. It shows experimental results of CaSiO3-He with diﬀerent

porosities (less 5% D1, D2 and 88% A). αcer appears to be higher for higher porosity although no direct

correlation could be made concerning the inﬂuence of roughness (see Table 1). Further, in this Figure the

deviations between the results of MD (0% porosity) and the experiment (CaSiO3 D1 and D2 less than 5%

porosity) appear to show a very slight inﬂuence of porosity, whereas this is further discussed in the following

section. Unfortunately, due to the diﬃculties in measurement and time constraints posed on the current

work, further data is unavailable. We note, however, that this raises interesting questions for future research.

5.4. Discussion

In the following a discussion of all obtained results is provided as several issues can be highlighted from

Figures 6, 7 and 8:

1. A comparison between the experimental and molecular dynamic results shows a similar increasing trend

versus the molar mass, although the values from MD are lower. This increasing trend is a well-known

and expected behavior which was highlighted in literature (e.g. see Saxena & Joshi [6]) and also in

earlier simulation studies [11, 13]. This point also demonstrates the validity of MD. Furthermore, the

results of the MD can be used as a lower limit for αcer on SiO2 & CaSiO3 since they are determined

on free surfaces, i.e. without taking adsorption eﬀects and surface roughness into account.

In the

course of this ideal limit, based on the experimental results, an inﬂuence can be assumed since the

deviations between the experimental and molecular-dynamic results are diﬀerent. To discuss this

further, one look back to Figure 5: Zacharjin [44] carried out very interesting measurements by showing

the inﬂuence of adsorption layers of contaminating gases. The authors were able to show that Ar, in the

absence of external contamination, is desorbed signiﬁcantly faster with increasing temperature (lower

αW −Ar) than when a N2 adsorption layer is present (higher αW −Ar). Accordingly, although N2 has a

lower molar mass than Ar, there is a higher enthalpy of adsorption for N2 and thus a fundamentally

higher thermal accommodation coeﬃcient in general, which is also observed in the literature for other

combinations of N2 (e.g. near room temperature W − N2: αW −N2 ≈ 0.5 or P t − N2: αP t−N2 ≈ 0.8,

see Saxena & Joshi [6]) as well as in everyday laboratory work [62].

A similar behavior can be seen for the experimental results on CaSiO3 D1. Regarding the MD

simulation for CaSiO3 D1-Ar a higher value for αcer can be expected due to the higher molar mass of

Ar than for CaSiO3 D1-N2. Nevertheless, the values for CaSiO3 D1-N2 are on a similar level as for

CaSiO3 D1-Ar representing a signiﬁcantly greater inﬂuence of an N2 adsorption layer.

2. The experimental results of Yamaguchi and Suzuki (CaSiO3 D2) agree very well with experimental

results (CaSiO3 D1). Furthermore, their results continue to exhibit similar deviations in comparison to

MD which could be attributed to adsorption. Therefore, it empowers the assumption of an adsorptive

inﬂuence on the surface and conﬁrms our results.

3. The results of Sonnick et al.

[59] with precipitated and fumed silica are not of experimental nature.

For the calculation of the thermal accommodation coeﬃcient the model of Kaganer [63] was used ex-

clusively based on the molecular masses of gas and wall molecules. This model neglects any inﬂuences

like temperature or adsorption or roughness, which can have major contributions to α. Further the

experimental validation of Kaganers model fails as it cannot predict well-measured thermal accommo-

dation coeﬃcients, e.g. αW −Ar,exp = 0.27 vs. αW −Ar,Kaganer = 0.58 (at 300 K). Therefore, the validity

of the results for precipitated and fumed silica are questionable until the experimental proof. (rev 2 pt

1)

18

4. The data obtained by McFall [5] are signiﬁcantly lower. By examining the obtained data of McFall [5]

one can see that a steady state has not been reached by the end of the measurements as it was also

stated in report of McFall [5]. This opens the question of a continuous surface contamination which

can have a huge impact on α as with increasing surface contamination the thermal accommodation

coeﬃcient increases, too [6]. (rev 2 pt 2)

5. From MD the results of amorphous SiO2 (blue cross) and CaSiO3 (red cross) reach very similar

values for all examined gases (see Figure 7). The reason for this close agreement can be attributed to

their similar composition and certain similar short range order structural features such as the SiO4

tetrahedron, and most importantly to the usage of the same gas-ion interaction potential parameter

values for the dominant species Si & O in both the cases. In addition, the gas-wall potential depth,

which strongly inﬂuences values of αcer, was also comparable for both, the Ca and O ions.

6. In MD, the slightly increasing diﬀerence of αcer between SiO2 and CaSiO3 with decreasing molar

mass of the gas, although the mass of the solid increases from SiO2 to CaSiO3, is attributed to the

existence of Ca. As per the hard sphere model (which accounts only for direct specular collisions as

observed in He), a large mismatch in molar mass between the gas (Ar, N2, He) molecules and the solid

(Ca) leads to ineﬃcient energy transfer between them [13]. Particularly for the case of CaSiO3-He,

the heavier Ca (relative to the He atom → mass of He / mass of Ca = 0.1) could be a potential reason

for the reduction of αcer as compared to SiO2.

7. The last discussion point is for the measurement of CaSiO3 A-He. The porosity of CaSiO3 A is 88%.

Although the porosity and the surface roughness have no recognizable relationship, a higher αcer is

observed, which would be expected with a higher surface roughness (compare Table 1). One reason

for this behavior could be due to the open porosity, where the gas particles also ﬂy into the porous

sample and collide very often with the solid structure resulting in an individual α close to 1. After a

(longer) phase within the sample they return to the surface and ﬂy into the free space of the gas gap.

Since not every particle “dips” into the open-pored structure, it can be assumed that this eﬀect only

occurs in part. To investigate this eﬀect further, the aim was to progress with the measurement of

CaSiO3 A-Ar. Unfortunately, however, it was not possible to determine the thermal accommodation

coeﬃcient because, as can be seen in Figure 9, there was a diﬀerent trend of the measuring points (red

crosses) over the Knudsen number in comparison to the model curve of λGas (blue line). A calculation

of αcer in this situation is not possible. λef f for CaSiO3 B (dotted line), which is very similar to

CaSiO3 A and was measured separately, increases in the range of measurability inﬂuencing the trend

of λGas signiﬁcantly, whereby the experimental values cannot be ﬁtted to Springer’s model.

6. Conclusions

A collaborative study between experiments and atomistic simulations on the determination of thermal ac-

commodation coeﬃcients on amorphous CaSiO3 and SiO2 with diﬀerent gases is presented. The thermal

accommodation coeﬃcient α, which is amongst other applications a part of the eﬀective thermal conductivity

of highly porous insulation materials, is usually set to unity for gases like Ar and N2 and 0.3 for He over a

wider temperature range, but it remained experimentally unveriﬁed leaving the reliability of existing models

of the eﬀective thermal conductivity in question. This open question was addressed using experimental

measurements as well as molecular dynamics simulations and the results are in good agreement (with ex-

plainable deviations) with this widely used assumption. It also conﬁrms the validity of using this assumption

in models of the eﬀective thermal conductivity. However, these results are only valid near room temperatures

and molecular dynamics results showed no signiﬁcant eﬀect on α (only 1% diﬀerence) by varying tempera-

tures ± 20 K around the room temperature, thus demanding no further investigation of this inﬂuence from

the experimental side in such short temperature range. But from literature, signiﬁcant inﬂuences on α at

elevated and cryogenic temperatures are expected and could be an open topic for future research, especially

using atomistic simulations. Further, though the inﬂuence of surface roughness, contamination and open

porosities could not be examined robustly, due to insuﬃcient measurement data to support clear scientiﬁc

claims, yet some interesting observations are made which provide options to future research.
