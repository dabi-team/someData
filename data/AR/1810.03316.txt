Abstract

A quadruple GEM detector has been assembled in a standalone conﬁguration and operated using Ar and CO2 gas
mixtures in proportions of 70:30 and 90:10. Detailed performance study of the detector has been made by using
106Ru-Rh β-source and X-ray spectrum of 55Fe source. Results of these measurements are presented in terms of gain,
eﬃciency, energy and time resolutions and also compared with our earlier triple GEM results. The energy resolution
has been found to be somewhat worse compared with that of the triple-GEM detector. Eﬀect of drift ﬁeld on electron
transparency and time resolution has been studied in detail.

Key words: quadruple GEM, triple GEM, drift ﬁeld, eﬀective gain, resolution, electron transparency

1. Introduction

In high energy physics (HEP) experiments, one of the
essential steps in the extraction of physical information
from particle detectors are to accurately reconstruct the
properties of the incoming particles. Multi-wire pro-
portional counters have been traditionally used for this
purpose in several large-scale experiments. The devel-
opment of the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detec-
tors [1, 2] over the last two decades with characteristics
like better position resolutions, long-term stability, and
high-rate handling, immediately attracted the attention
of the HEP professionals, and attempts have been made
to integrate GEM based detectors into many experi-
ments [3, 4, 5, 6]. At the same time, several studies have
been made with diﬀerent GEM detector conﬁgurations
to achieve the requirements of the experiments. These
have produced very promising results in terms of high
rate radiation measurements, low discharge probability,
low ion back ﬂow (IBF), excellent position and energy
resolutions as well as good time resolution [5, 7, 8, 9].
GEM detectors are seen to be suitable for a long time
stable operation without any appreciable aging in high
radiation environment [7, 10, 11].

A GEM foil consists of an insulator made of a 50 µm
thick Kapton foil with 5 µm thick copper cladding on
both sides and pierced by a regular array of holes. From
the time of the invention of GEM lot of studies have

been carried out with single GEM, double GEM, and
triple GEM detectors. In a multi-stack GEM detector
setup, the hole diameter, pitch, electric ﬁeld across dif-
ferent gas gap can be optimised to minimise the dis-
charge probability [12] and IBF [8, 13, 14, 15, 16]. It is
also noticed that with increasing number of GEM foils
the detector can be operated at a lower voltage across
the GEM foils at a ﬁxed gain [12, 14]. The advantages
in multi-GEM detector like lower operating voltage, low
discharge probability, and low IBF make it more attrac-
tive for large drift volume and high radiation environ-
ment.

Over these years, most experiments have almost set-
tled for triple GEM conﬁguration for the detection of
charged particles, as can be seen in both existing and
planned future experiments [5, 6, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
Investigation of detectors with more than 3 GEM foils
has been focused towards speciﬁc applications,
like
photon detection using CsI cathode [23], making a
gaseous photomultiplier tube by Breskin’s group [14,
24, 25], in RICH application [26] or where IBF reduc-
tion becomes essential as in the ALICE Time Projection
Chamber (TPC) [27]. The quadruple GEM conﬁgura-
tion used for ALICE TPC readout is very special em-
ploying diﬀerent hole size and pitch in diﬀerent layers.
In the present study, we have constructed a quadru-
ple GEM detector and performed a detailed character-
istic study in the standalone conﬁguration. Here we

present the results of our ﬁnding in terms of the ef-
fective gain, energy resolution and eﬃciency measure-
ments with Ar/CO2 90:10 and 70:30 gas mixtures. The
results obtained in this study will also be compared with
our triple GEM results [28, 29]. The eﬀect of the drift
ﬁeld (Ed) on the gain variations and time resolution are
also studied in detail.

2. Detector construction and test setup

A quadruple GEM detector has been assembled for
detailed characteristics study at Variable Energy Cy-
clotron Centre, Kolkata, India. The components used
in the detector assembly are obtained from CERN,
Geneva. The GEM foils, used in this detector, have
70 µm diameter hole and 140 µm pitch in a hexago-
nal pattern with 10×10 cm2 active area. The position
of the GEM foils and the diﬀerent gaps of the detec-
tor are shown in a schematic diagram in Fig. 1. Four
GEM foils are placed one above the other followed by a
drift (cathode) plane on the top, above the readout PCB.
The readout plane has 120 pads of an equal area over
the 10×10 cm2 PCB surface for picking up signals. The
drift plane, GEM foils, and the readout plane are cov-
ered by G10 frame with a window on the top covered
by a Kapton foil for the gas tightness. The drift gap,
transfer gaps and the induction gap of the detector are
4.8-2-2-2-2 mm, respectively. The present conﬁgura-
tion is somewhat similar to that reported recently [30],
but very diﬀerent from the one employed in the AL-
ICE TPC [27] and also in other multi-GEM detectors
reported in literature [14, 26].

For the construction of the detector, at ﬁrst all the
GEM foils are passed through quality assurance (QA)
tests. In the QA testing procedure, all the GEM foils are
kept in a Nitrogen environment and 500 V is applied
across the foils. The leakage currents of the GEM foils
are measured for 30 minutes. The acceptance criteria
of the foils are that the current must be below 500 pA
without any major spark. A quadruple GEM detector
is assembled as per the schematic of Fig. 1 with the
foils which have passed the QA. The detector is oper-
ated with Ar and CO2 gas mixtures with two diﬀerent
ratios, 90:10 and 70:30 at atmospheric pressure.

The experimental setup of the detector is shown in
Fig. 2. The high voltage (HV) is applied through a re-
sistor chain to produce required electric ﬁeld within the
holes of the GEM foils and in the diﬀerent gaps. The
resulting electric ﬁeld within the tiny holes is very high,
∼60 kV/cm so that it can produce charge avalanches.
The ﬁeld in diﬀerent gaps is ∼1-2 kV/cm only for the
drift of electrons. The details of the resistor chain used

in this study are shown in Fig. 3. The resistor chain with
single HV channel as in the top panel of Fig. 3 is used
for the measurements of Section 3.1−3.4. In a second
scheme, two HV channels are used as shown in the bot-
tom panel of Fig. 3. This is used to change the drift ﬁeld
independently without changing any other ﬁeld conﬁgu-
rations. This scheme is used for the study of the eﬀect of
drift ﬁeld on electron transparency (see Section 3.5) and
on the time resolution (see Section 3.6) of the detector.
In this test setup, NIM (Nuclear Instrumentation
Module) based electronics modules have been used for

3. Test results and discussion

Tests of the detector have been carried out using ra-
dioactive sources after stabilisation of the gas ﬂow and
minimisation of the electronic noise. Figure 4 shows the
55Fe X-ray spectrum measured by the quadruple GEM
detector set up at the total GEM voltage, ∆VGEM−tot =
1275 V for Ar/CO2 of 70:30 gas mixture. 55Fe decays
via electron capture producing 55Mn with a half-life of
2.73 years. The vacancy in the K-shell produced by
electron capture is shortly ﬁlled by an electron from
a higher shell.
In this process, Kα X-ray of energy
5.89 keV is emitted. The smaller peak corresponding
to ∼2.89 keV is the Ar K-shell X-ray escape from the
gas volume known as Ar escape peak. The main photo-
peak of 55Fe source of energy 5.89 keV along with Ar
escape peak is shown in Fig. 4. An asymmetric broad-
ening of the peak is observed, which could arise because
of detector eﬀects. The 55Fe spectra at diﬀerent gas
mixtures and voltages have been analyzed in detail to
calculate eﬀective gain, energy resolution, and electron
transparency.

Figure 4: The pulse-height spectrum of 55Fe X-ray source of the
quadruple GEM detector. The peak at ∼2.89 keV corresponds to the
Ar escape peak. The main photo peak corresponds to the Kα X-ray of
energy 5.89 keV.

The next set of tests have been performed by exposing
the GEM detector to 106Ru-Rh β− source. The result-
ing spectrum, taken at ∆VGEM−tot = 1316 V in Ar/CO2
70:30 gas mixture, is shown in Fig. 5. The β-spectrum
is continuous with a long tail extending to large ADC
values. The 106Ru-Rh source has also been used for the
eﬃciency and time resolution measurements.

3.1. Detector eﬃciency and operating condition

Measurement of the eﬃciency for the quadruple
GEM detector is done in a similar manner to the eﬃ-
ciency measurement of the triple GEM [28]. The trig-

tom panel shows the resistor chain for voltage divider for independent

the signal processing. A sum-up board is used to add up
signals from all the 120 readout pads. The summed-up
signal is processed by a charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer
(model ORTEC 142IH) which converts the charge sig-
nal to voltage signal. The noise level is ∼1100 elec-
trons and the sensitivity is 1 mV/fC. The capacitance be-
tween the detector and pre-ampliﬁer has been obtained
to be 68 pF. The output voltage signal is fed to an am-
pliﬁer (model ORTEC 572) for all the measurements,
except for the measurement of time resolution where a
fast ampliﬁer is used as discussed in Section 3.6. The
signal shaping time of the ampliﬁer is set to 1 µs to col-
lect maximum charges of the signal and the radioactive
sources used here have low rate so no pile-up of the sig-
nal is expected with 1 µs shaping time. The output volt-
age signal of the ampliﬁer is fed to a 12-bit ADC (model
ORTEC ASPEC-927) with resolution 2.44 mV/ADC
channel. The ADC module acquires a single spectrum
for voltages without any discrimination. The electronic
modules used in this measurement have been calibrated
to avoid any errors. It is to be noted that no external
threshold has been applied in the electronics readout.
However, the ADC module was insensitive for voltage
< 40 mV, so there is no count at low ADC channel in
the energy spectrum.

ger was provided by the coincidence signal of a set of
three detectors, two cross scintillators placed above the
detector and a third scintillator placed below. All the
three scintillators are placed in a conﬁguration to max-
imise the overlap. The 106Ru-Rh β−-source is placed
on the top of the cross scintillators. The scintillators
are chosen to be very thin (∼2 mm) so that β− particles
penetrate through those. The number of triggered par-
ticles giving the signal on the GEM detector yields the
eﬃciency. The variation of eﬃciency as a function of
applied GEM voltage for the two gas mixtures is shown
in Fig. 6. Eﬃciency rapidly increases with GEM volt-
age and then saturates after certain voltage. The start-
ing of the plateau region corresponds to the operational
voltage of the GEM detector, which in the present case
are 1120 V and 1300 V for the 90:10 and 70:30 gas
mixtures, respectively. The eﬃciency at the plateau is
∼94%. The absolute value of the eﬃciency depends on
the electronics and trigger particle. The ADC module
used in this measurement was insensitive below 40 mV.
This may result in some loss of eﬃciency and thus the
eﬃciency does not reach 100%.

3.2. Detector gain

Figure 6: Eﬃciency of the quadrupole detector as a function of
∆VGEM−tot is presented for two Ar/CO2 gas mixtures. The statistical
errors are small (within a couple of percent) and within the symbol
size.

triple GEM detector [28] are also included in the ﬁgure.
It is important to notice that to have similar gain the in-
dividual GEM voltage required in case of triple GEM
detector is higher than that for the quadruple GEM de-
tector.

Figure 7: Eﬀective gain as a function of ∆VGEM−single is presented
with diﬀerent Ar/CO2 gas mixtures for the quadruple GEM and triple
GEM detectors. The statistical errors are small and within the symbol

GEM detector gain has been calculated from the main
photo peak of the 55Fe 5.89 keV X-ray spectrum.
In
Fig. 4, we have shown the Gaussian ﬁt to the spectrum,
from where we obtain the peak position and width cor-
responding to 5.89 keV energy. Gain values are cal-
culated according to the procedure given in Ref. [28].
Gains are plotted as a function of the GEM voltage for
both the gas mixtures, as shown in Fig. 7. For a given
value of the GEM voltage (∆VGEM−single), the gain for
90:10 gas mixture is much larger compared to that of
the 70:30 gas mixture. For comparison, results of the

The GEM foils operate at the low voltage across it
have low gas gain which corresponds to stable oper-
ation against discharge within the GEM. Because dis-
charge depends on the gain and it is proportional to the
gain value. We have not measured the stability of GEM
against discharge in this study. However, the discharge
study of GEM detector is reported in past by Bachmann
et al. [12] for multiple GEM conﬁguration and also dis-
cussed in Ref. [31]. They have shown that the detector is
less prone to discharge with increasing number of GEM
foils and it also depends on the voltages applied across

3.3. Energy resolution of the detector

The energy resolution is calculated from the Gaussian
ﬁt parameters of the 5.89 keV peak of the 55Fe spectrum.
The energy resolution in terms of full width at half max-
imum (FWHM) as a function of the individual GEM
voltage is shown in Fig. 8 for two diﬀerent gas mix-
tures in case of both quadruple GEM and triple GEM
conﬁgurations. Energy resolutions are somewhat better
for 90:10 gas mixture compared to 70:30. For both gas
mixtures, the energy resolutions in case of quadruple
GEM detector are larger compared to those of the triple
GEM detector. Similar results have also been reported
in a previous study [27], where the eﬀect has been at-
tributed to low IBF in case of quadruple GEM detec-
tor. Low IBF is achieved in the quadruple GEM detec-
tor in low ﬁeld conﬁguration so that ions are stopped at
the copper part of the GEMs. The ﬁeld setting aﬀects
the electron transmission eﬃciency. In particular, low
voltage in the ﬁrst GEM favours low IBF. However, it
causes the losses of the primary electrons from the drift
volume and low gain as a result of worsens the energy
resolution.

mixture. Same readout electronics have been used for
the study of both the triple GEM and quadruple GEM
detectors. Thus the gain should be the only factor for
eﬃciency determination irrespective of the kind of the
detector and gas mixtures used in the study. For a
given applied ∆VGEM−single, the gain of the detectors
have been measured using 55Fe source and the data have
already been shown in Fig. 7. For the same value of
∆VGEM−single eﬃciency value can be taken from Fig. 6.
Similarly, data for triple GEM detector have been taken
from the Ref. [28]. A compilation of the two data sets
for eﬃciency as a function of eﬀective gain has been

creases with eﬀective gain and then comes to a plateau
after certain gain. It is to be noted that the eﬃciency
plateau starts from a similar gain value in all four cases,
irrespective of the kind of GEM detector and its gas
compositions. Thus gain plays a principal role in eﬃ-
ciency measurement. It is found that eﬃciency reaches
a maximum value at the gain ∼5000 for both the detec-
tors.

sented with diﬀerent Ar/CO2 gas mixtures for both quadrupole and
triple GEM detectors. The statistical errors are small and within the
symbol size.

3.4. Comparison of eﬃciency for triple GEM and

quadruple GEM detectors

The magnitude of the detector signal depends on the
amount of charge collected by the readout pads and
hence on the factors like gain, number of primary ion-
ization and sensitivity of the electronics. For fully ab-
sorbed 55Fe X-ray the number of primary ionization
produced within the drift volume depends on the gas

GEM detectors. The statistical errors are small and within the symbol
size.

3.5. Drift ﬁeld eﬀect and electron transparency

Drift electric ﬁeld (Ed) of a GEM detector is deﬁned
as the ﬁeld between drift plane (cathode) and the top
of the ﬁrst GEM foil. In the presence of drift ﬁeld, the
primary electrons produced within the drift gap drift to-
wards the top GEM foil and transfer through the holes
for the electron multiplication and go through subse-
quent steps. The number of primary electrons trans-
ferred through the holes of the top GEM foils depends
on the drift electric ﬁeld and the top GEM ﬁeld [13].

The eﬀect of drift ﬁeld (Ed) in the electron trans-
parency was studied for the quadruple GEM detector for

In this setup, the re-
sistor chain is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3 was
used to change drift ﬁeld and GEM voltages indepen-
dently. The mean value of the ADC channel no. has
been calculated from the 5.89 keV X-ray peak at diﬀer-
ent ﬁeld values keeping GEM voltages constant. The to-
tal charge collection on the readout depends on electron
multiplication and hence on GEM voltages, therefore
the results with diﬀerent GEM voltage sets are normal-
ized to unity for comparison with the assumption that
full transparency is reached at the plateau region. The
electron transparency of the detector is deﬁned as the ra-
tio of primary electrons collected in the ﬁrst GEM holes
and the number of primary electrons created within the
drift volume.

1000-1500 V/cm, respectively. Earlier it was seen that
the operating GEM voltage of Ar/CO2 70:30 gas mix-
ture is higher compared to that of the Ar/CO2 90:10 gas
mixture. The drift ﬁelds within the holes of Ar/CO2
70:30 are higher for in comparison to the 90:10 gas mix-
ture, and so the drift electrons could be focused through
it more eﬃciently. At higher Ed, the electron transparen-
cies of Ar/CO2 70:30 remain relatively high.

The results are in qualitative agreement with sim-
ilar studies for single GEM carried out by S. Bach-
mann et al. [13]. The electron collection eﬃciency or
transparency increases initially, attain a plateau and de-
creases after that. Low collection eﬃciency at lower
ﬁeld value might occur because of losses of electrons
due to diﬀusion, recombination or attachment of the
electrons with the contaminant of the gas. However, at
higher drift ﬁeld the electric ﬁeld lines are terminated at
the top conducting surface of the GEM. Some ioniza-
tion electrons possibly might be collected on the GEM
surface.

tion of Ed for Ar/CO2 with 90:10 (upper panel) and

parency increase with Ed attains an optimum value and
then decreases. The optimum transparency of the elec-
trons for the Ar/CO2 90:10 and 70:30 gas mixtures are
found at drift ﬁeld (Ed) values of 750-1000 V/cm and

The eﬀect of drift ﬁeld on the operation of GEM has
been further explored. The eﬀective gain of the detec-
tor is also measured by varying the GEM voltages with

It can be found that the highest gain cor-

responds to Ed∼1000 V/cm, which is the closest drift
ﬁeld for the maximum electron transparency for both
the gas mixtures. The somewhat larger diﬀerences in
gain values at lower ∆VGEM−tot are found to narrow
down with increasing ∆VGEM−tot. The reason for this
is that the transparency depends on both ﬁrst GEM and
the drift ﬁeld. At lower GEM voltages, drift ﬁeld eﬀect
is quite strong as was seen in the gain value. However,
at higher GEM voltages, the electric ﬁeld across GEM
is so large that a signiﬁcant fraction of the electrons are
focused through the hole. Hence, electron transparency
increases. So the drift ﬁeld becomes less important and
the gain values converge to a single value. From Fig. 10
and 11 it can be concluded that both drift ﬁeld and ﬁeld
across the holes of the ﬁrst GEM have important roles
in electron transparency depending on the ﬁeld range.

3.6. Time resolution

Figure 12: Time spectrum of the quadruple GEM detector.

The time resolution of a detector is the measurement
of the spread of the time for a set of events. The time
resolution of the quadruple GEM detector is measured
in Ar/CO2 70:30 gas mixture. The threefold scintillator
trigger setup is used in this measurement with 106Ru-
Rh β−-source providing the trigger. The detector signal
is passed through the timing output of ORTEC 142IH
Pre-Amp to a fast ampliﬁer. ORTEC model-454 timing
ﬁlter ampliﬁer (TFA) is used with integral and diﬀeren-
tial time both set to 50 ns which is optimized to have a
sharp clear signal with minimum noise ﬂuctuation. The
threefold trigger signal from the scintillators is used as
a start signal and the ampliﬁed detector signal after dis-
criminator is used as the stop signal for the ORTEC 567
Time to Amplitude Converter (TAC) module. The time

diﬀerence between the start and the stop signals pro-
vides the time spectrum, which is shown in Fig. 12.

Figure 13: Variation of time resolution as a function of drift ﬁeld (Ed)
of the quadruple GEM detector. The statistical errors are small and
within the symbol size.

Time resolution of a detector depends on the property
of the gas mixtures, speciﬁcally on the electron drift ve-
locity and thus the drift ﬁeld. The eﬀects of drift ﬁeld
(Ed) on time resolution has been studied and is shown in
Fig. 13. For this study, the detector gain was set at ∼104
and the GEM voltages were also kept constant through-
out the measurement. It is observed that time resolution
decreases with drift ﬁeld and remains almost constant
at higher drift ﬁeld. The time resolution of a gas de-
tector depends on how fast the primary electron cluster
reaches the readout. This depends on the drift velocity
of the electrons. In Ar/CO2 70:30 gas mixture, the drift
velocity increases with the increase of electric ﬁeld and
remains almost constant above 2 kV/cm. The time res-
olution decreases with drift ﬁeld and does not improve
much with increasing the drift ﬁeld above 2 kV/cm. The
optimum value of the time resolution, ∼13 ns has been
obtained with the present setup.
In this measurement
scintillators timing correction is also considered. It is to
be noted that in this setup time walk correction of the
GEM detector could not be taken care of. The time res-
olution of the quadruple GEM detector is slightly worse
than the measured value of triple GEM [5, 28].

A quadruple GEM detector has been assembled and
tested keeping in mind its usefulness in future HEP ex-
periments. For comparative studies, the detector has
been operated with Ar/CO2 at 90:10 and 70:30 gas mix-
tures. The detector has been tested with using 55Fe
and 106Ru-Rh radioactive sources. Basic characteristics

like energy spectrum, gain, energy resolution, and eﬃ-
ciency have been measured and compared with that of
triple GEM detector setup. Usefulness of the quadru-
ple GEM detector is understood in terms of the low
operating voltage (∆VGEM−single) compared to the triple
GEM at similar gain responses. Low operating voltages
are preferable for long term stable operation. However,
quadruple GEM detector has somewhat poorer energy
resolution compared to the triple GEM, which is con-
sistent with earlier measurements. The time resolution
of the quadruple GEM detector is also measured with
diﬀerent Ed and the obtained optimum value is ∼13 ns.
We have shown the importance of gain measurements
and intricate relationships of gain and eﬃciency mea-
surements. The inﬂuence of the drift ﬁeld (Ed) on pri-
mary electron transparency has been shown and Ed has
to be optimized to transfer a maximum number of elec-
trons from the drift volume to the top GEM foil.
