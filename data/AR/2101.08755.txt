Abstract 

High-Sc Al1-xScxN thin films are of tremendous interest because of their attractive 

piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, but overall film quality and reproducibility are 

widely reported to suffer as x increases. In this study, we correlate the structure and electrical 

properties of Al0.6Sc0.4N with in-situ observations of glow discharge optical emission during 

growth. This in-situ technique uses changes in the Ar(I) and N2(I) emission lines of the glow 

discharge during growth to identify films that subsequently exhibit unacceptable structural 

and electrical performance. We show that a steady deposition throughout film growth 

produces ferroelectric Al0.6Sc0.4N with a reversible 80 μC cm-1 polarization and 3.1 MV cm-1

coercive field. In other films deposited using identical settings, fluctuations in both Ar(I) and 

N2(I) line intensities correspond to decreased wurtzite phase purity, nm-scale changes to the 

film microstructure, and a non-ferroelectric response. These results illustrate the power of 

optical emission spectroscopy for tracking changes when fabricating process-sensitive 

samples such as high-Sc Al1-xScxN films. 

1.  Introduction 

Interest in the growth of AlN based group-III metal nitride semiconductor alloys such as 

(Al,Ga)N and (Al,In,Ga)N continues to increase as the associated application space expands. 

First the interest was driven by their tunable properties for light emitting diodes (LEDs) and 

other optoelectronic applications [1] and by their wide band gap (WBG) semiconductor 

properties for high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) in RF and power electronic 

applications.[2] Scandium additions to AlN were first reported to produce significant increases 

in piezoelectric response in 2009[3] and were very quickly adopted for the piezoelectric thin 

film devices such as film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) in cell phones.[4] Recent reports 

on ferroelectricity in Al1-xScxN for x≥0.1 have sparked additional scientific interest as the first 

wurtzite ferroelectric material[5,6]  and significant technological interest as a candidate for 

hybrid logic-in-memory devices. 

Large scale commercial applications of piezoelectric Al1-xScxN are still limited to 

relatively modest levels of Sc substitution (x<0.1), though there are many literature reports of 

Al1-xScxN films having x≥0.1 with exceptional properties.[3-12] It has been widely reported that 

increasing Sc content, desired for increased piezoelectric response and lower-field 

ferroelectric switching, increases the challenge of growing high quality textured Al1-xScxN 

films[13-15]. This challenge is driven in no small part by the thermodynamic driving force for 

phase separation in this system.[16,17] This degradation in film properties for large x values has 

been correlated with wurtzite-(0002) texture reduction with the presence of misoriented 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
grains[11] and the associated difficulties with reliably controlling the stress state in sputtered 

films.[18] However, in each case the conclusions are correlational and are drawn largely or 

entirely from ex-situ measurements, so they are of limited value for deposition process 

control.  

Many in-situ monitoring techniques have been reported to tune the deposition of AlN thin 

films: glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES),[19,20] reflection high-energy 

electron diffraction (RHEED),[21,22] reflectance interferometry (RI),[23] and ellipsometry.[24] 

While useful as surface diagnostic tools for understanding how the film develops, RHEED, 

RI, and ellipsometry are costly methods which require significant adaptation to the system 

such as beam alignment. On the other hand, GD-OES only requires line of sight to the glow 

discharge. GD-OES is also able to evaluate the target poison mode for reactive depositions, 

which is an important step for optimizing rf sputtered nitrides.[20] However, there presently 

lacks literature on incorporating GD-OES when growing Al1-xScxN, which is an opportunity 

considering the difficulty of producing a purely wurtzite phase, particularly for large values of 

x. 

In this paper, we investigate the process of sputtering Al1-xScxN thin films using GD-OES 

with support from residual gas analysis (RGA), which are two well-known, non-intrusive, in-

situ monitoring techniques. Consistent with the increased variability of film quality previously 

reported, Al0.6Sc0.4N films deposited in this study under identical settings for preconditioning 

steps and growth parameters exhibit drastically different structures and electrical properties. 

While the precise mechanism(s) for this disparity remain(s) unclear, we clearly correlate 

changes in phase content and microstructure with deposition process fluctuations observed by 

time-resolved GD-OES. These process fluctuations have critical effects on resulting electrical 

properties, exemplified by the clear ferroelectric switching of single-phase homogeneous 

Al0.6Sc0.4N deposited from a continuous process and the absence of ferroelectric polarization

reversal in two-phase Al0.6Sc0.4N that resulted from observed process fluctuations of unknown 

origin. 

2.  Results and discussion 

Figure 1a shows the XRD θ-2θ patterns for films deposited using the same deposition 

conditions and pre-treatments that have previously been optimized for this chamber (see 

Experimental Section). The patterns indicate that one film has a pure c-axis textured wurtzite 

structure (wz-AlScN) and the other is a mixed wurtzite/rocksalt structure (wz/rs-AlScN). The 

(0002) peak appears at 36.3° and corresponds to a c-axis lattice parameter of 0.494 nm for 

each sample which closely match previous reports for Al0.6Sc0.4N.[11] Additionally, there is a 

significant phase difference as indicated by the appearance of the (111) rocksalt peak at 35.7° 

as previously reported[3,25] and in line with theoretical work on the thermodynamic 

relationship between wurtzite and rocksalt in Al1-xScxN.[17] For samples grown using the same 

deposition conditions, it is interesting that there is a large discrepancy in phases. For both 

samples, the wz-(10-10) peak appears at 31.5° in Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the (0002) peak 

profile in χ space. This provides a similar film structure property as an ω-rocking curve which 

measures the out of plane texture of a particular 2θ position. 2-dimensional XRD patterns for 

each sample are provided in Figure S1. In Figure 1b we see similar out of plane texture 

between the two films, albeit a slightly lower FWHM for wz-AlScN at 2.8° than the wz/rs-

AlScN sample with 3.1°. Based off the broad χ FWHM (>10°), the (10-10) peak has poor out 

of plane texture.

Bright field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM) images in Figure 

2 revealed a columnar structure in both films with thicknesses of 325 nm and 337 nm for wz-

AlScN and wz/rs-AlScN, respectively. The wz-AlScN sample exhibits a uniform structure 

through the thickness of the film, whereas striations are apparent in the wz/rs-AlScN sample 

as indicated by the timestamps. Assuming an overall constant deposition rate, the features 

occur at minutes 44, 56, 59, and 74 of the 110 minute deposition. Selected area electron 

diffraction (SAED) patterns of the film bulk in Figure 2b,d reveal that the films grow along 

the [0001] direction. The lack of (10-10) reflections in Figure 2b is a matter of sample 

alignment in the TEM. TEM-EDS maps and profiles show no indication of chemical 

segregation in either sample (Figure S2).

Optical emission of the glow discharge near the substrate surface was collected for all 

growths. Lines at 337.0 nm and 696.5 nm which respectively correspond to excited molecular 

N2(I) and atomic Ar(I) states were tracked during the deposition (Figure 3a). A representative 

full emission spectrum is provided in Figure S3. There are four peaks in both the Ar and N2 

lines for the wz/rs-AlScN sample that occur at times 44, 55, 59, and 71 minutes. These peaks 

align in time with the microstructure features in Figure 2c.  However, the nearly uniform 

emission lines for wz-AlScN points toward a stable deposition which led to a single phase and 

pure (0002) textured film. The variation in the intensity of the lines indicates a change in glow 

discharge emission. While there could be multiple sources for this change (change in target 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
poisoning and/or forward power, target flaking, magnetron configuration, etc.), the effects on 

the film structure and properties are clear and unambiguous.

for both the wz-AlScN (black) and wz/rs-AlScN (red) samples. (b) Partial pressure ratio of 

N2/Ar and total pressure throughout the deposition. 

Figure 3b compares the ratio of the partial pressures of N2/Ar collected by the RGA 

during the deposition. The lack of clear features (i.e., peaks or troughs) in the ratio scans 

indicates a stable pressure and gas flow rate during both film growths. This demonstrates that 

changes in GD-OES line intensities are separate from either a change in gas ratio or total 

7 

 
 
 
 
pressure. The gradual slope of both emission lines is related to the slight changes in total 

pressure throughout the deposition for both samples. 

Polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops were measured on parallel plate 

capacitors fabricated from both thin film samples. In Figure 4a the wz-AlScN PE loop shows 

a saturated hysteresis loop indicative of the highly c-axis textured structure of the film. With a 

remanent polarization of 80 μC cm-1 and a coercive field of 3.1 MV cm-1, the properties of 

this sample are consistent with previous reports on x=0.4 chemistries in Al1-xScxN.[5,6] There 

is a 7.5% error associated with the polarization values due to uncertainty of the device area. In 

comparison, the mixed phase layered wz/rs-AlScN sample did not exhibit ferroelectric 

switching up to 4.1 MV cm-1 (the maximum electric field sustained before catastrophic device 

failure) which is related to the presence of the rocksalt phase. Thus, the lack of ferroelectric 

properties in wz/rs-AlScN can be correlated with observations from the GD-OES during film 

growth.

3. Conclusion 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
In summary, in-situ time-resolved GD-OES has been correlated with changes in 

Al0.6Sc0.4N film crystal structure and microstructure when using the same growth parameters. 

These changes apparent in the XRD and BF-STEM measurements reveal that phase 

segregation into rocksalt and wurtzite originates as a fluctuation in the glow discharge 

chemistry. The in-situ GD-OES technique also allows for predicting film properties since the 

peaks in the Ar(I) and N2(I) emission lines relate to changes in the glow discharge which 

directly influences growth conditions. The results show that a steady deposition without 

fluctuations throughout film growth produces ferroelectric wz-Al0.6Sc0.4N with a reversible 80 

μC cm-1 polarization and 3.1 MV cm-1 coercive field. Monitoring the deposition will help to 

mitigate rocksalt phase formation and improve process reliability for emerging ferroelectric 

Al1-xScxN especially when pushing toward higher x.  

4. Experimental Section/Methods 

Thin-film Al0.6Sc0.4N samples were produced via reactive radio-frequency (rf) 

magnetron sputtering on (111) textured platinized silicon substrates (Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si) with a 

rocking curve (ω) FWHM <1.3°. The growth chamber had a base pressure of 5x10-7 Torr. 

During the deposition, the pressure was set to 2 mTorr with gas flow rates of 15/5 sccm for 

Ar/N2. The substrate temperature was set to 400 °C while rotating at 20 rpm at a distance of 

16.5 cm from the target. A 3” Al0.6Sc0.4 alloy target (Stanford Advanced Materials, 99.9 at. % 

pure) was used with a 6.6 W cm-1 forward power density. The target was pre-sputtered for 60 

minutes under the same parameters as the deposition to reduce target surface oxidation. 

In-situ monitoring consisted of an OES and an RGA. The light emitted from the glow 

discharge was collected through a 3° collimator lens aimed at the substrate surface by an 

EPP2000-UVN-SR spectrometer (StellarNet Inc) with a 0.5 nm resolution (Figure S4). The 

fiber optic feedthrough was mounted by a CF flange to the deposition chamber. The relative 

intensity of the Ar(I) and N2(I) lines as a function of time t plotted in Figure 3a is a ratio of the 
9 

 
 
 
 
I(t)/Io after subtracting the background signal which was collected prior to striking the glow 

discharge, where Io is the initial spectrum collect as a reference. For OES collection, 10 

spectra were subsequently collected for 5 seconds each and then averaged, which led to a 50 

second time interval between each data point. This was performed to increase the signal to 

noise since the glow discharge density is much lower near the substrate surface than the target 

surface.  

To investigate the crystal structure, X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Discover) and 

selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were employed. To produce 1-dimensional plots 

(Intensity vs. 2θ) from the 2-dimensional detector on the Bruker XRD which simultaneously 

collects intensity in χ and 2θ space during a scan, the intensity is integrated across χ (60°-

120°). Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) images were acquired using an 

FEI Talos F200X at 200 keV with a camera length of 77 mm. Cross-sectional lamellae were 

prepared using an FEI Helios Nanolab 600i FIB/SEM. A cleaning pass was performed at 2kV 

to remove Ga implantation and surface damage, and final specimen thicknesses were around 

100 nm. Element mapping was performed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), 

measured in the TEM using a Super-X EDS system. Signal analysis was done using Bruker 

Esprit 1.9. 

The films were electrically characterized on parallel plate capacitors with Pt top 

electrodes deposited through a shadow mask by direct-current sputtering. Devices were driven 

from the bottom Pt electrode and sensed from the top Pt contact at an excitation frequency of 

10 kHz. The maximum electric field was gradually reduced for each nested loop for 

determining the coercive field. PE loops were generated with a Precision Multiferroic system 

from Radiant Technologies.

The emission lines from the excited states of molecular N2(I) at 337.0 nm and atomic 

Ar(I) at 696.5 nm are presented in this work. The excited molecular N2 line corresponds to a 

transition between the zero-point vibrational levels of two electronic states represented by 

C3Πu→B3Πg which needs 11.1 eV to occur. The excited Ar(I) state requires a 13.6 eV to 

occur when populated by the ground state of the neutral Ar. This makes Ar(I) at 696.5 nm a 

useful parameter to represent the state of electrons with moderate energy.[26]
