ABSTRACT

Using our previously reported observations, we derive some physical parameters of the mod-
erately fast nova V2676 Ophiuchi 2012 #1. The best-ﬁt CLOUDY model of the nebular spectrum
obtained on 2015 May 8 shows a hot white dwarf source with T BB ∼ 1.0 × 10 5 K having a lu-
minosity of 1.0 × 10 38 ergs s −1 . Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta are signiﬁcantly
enhanced relative to solar, He/H = 2.14, O/H = 2.37, S/H = 6.62 and Ar/H = 3.25. The ejecta mass
is estimated to be 1.42 × 10 −5 M ⊙ . The nova showed a pronounced dust formation phase after
90 days from discovery. The J-H and H-K colors were very large as compared to other molecule-
and dust-forming novae in recent years. The dust temperature and mass at two epochs have been
estimated from spectral energy distribution (SED) ﬁts to infrared photometry.

Key words: optical: spectra - line : identiﬁcation - stars : novae, cataclysmic variables - stars :

Introduction

All novae are members of close binary systems containing white dwarfs (WDs)
as the primary stars and late type main sequence (MS) stars or giants as the secon-
daries or companions. A close binary may be detached, semi-detached, or a contact
system depending on whether the companion star ﬁlls its Roche lobe. The classical
novae (CNe) are semi-detached binary systems with a late-type main sequence star
(the secondary) transferring material via Roche lobe overﬂow to a white-dwarf (the
primary). The mass transfer results in the formation of an accretion disc around the
white dwarf. The runaway thermonuclear reactions on the white dwarf surface give

rise to the cataclysmic outburst, the sudden brightening, observed in these systems.
Novae brighten by 10 - 12 magnitudes in a few hours and subsequently fade back
to the original faint level over a period lasting several months to years. Evidences
for early re-formation of the accretion disk, and presence of a circumbinary disk
have been found in recent times, (e.g. U Sco: Anupama et al. 2013 and references
therein).

Novae provide a unique opportunity to study the interaction of changing radia-
tion ﬁeld with expanding ejecta spanning a wide range of physical parameters like
electron number density and temperature. There are different phases during the
nova evolution viz. Fireball phase, when the ejecta is optically thick and behaves
like a ﬁreball which radiates as a hot blackbody of temperature 6000 - 10000 K ;
optically thin emission phase when the nova shell expands, becomes less dense and
transparent. We may also see molecule and dust formation phase in some novae. It
is generally accepted that the CNe binary system contains a carbon-oxygen (CO)
or oxygen-neon (ONe) WD primary and a low mass secondary. Based on the opti-
cal spectra, novae are classiﬁed mainly in two categories Fe II and He/N (Williams
2012). But there are some hybrid novae which have been reported recently show-
ing both the characteristic of Fe II and He/N novae in one outburst (see Raj et al.
2015a, Williams et al. 2017 and references therein).

Nova V2676 Oph was discovered in outburst on 2012 March 25.789 UT at V
= 12.1 (Nishimura et al. 2012). The optical spectra clearly indicate (from the nu-
merous Fe II lines) that the nova belongs to Fe II spectral class. The distance to
the nova was estimated to be between 6.9 and 7.9 kpc (Raj et al. 2017). The nova
showed molecule formation and subsequently dust formation during the outburst
(see Kawakita et al. 2017 and references therein). We have used the CLOUDY
photoionization code, C13.04 (Ferland et al. 2013) for the abundance analysis
in V2676 Oph. This method has been used earlier to determine the elemental
abundances for novae by modeling the observed spectra e.g. LMC 1991 (Schwarz
2001), QU Vul (Schwarz et al. 2002), V1974 Cyg (Vanlandingham et al. 2005),
V838 Her & V4160 Sgr (Schwarz et al. 2007a), V1186 Sco (Schwarz et al. 2007b),
V1065 Cen (Helton et al. 2010) and RS Oph (Das & Mondal 2015, Mondal et al.
2018).

2. Data

In this paper we have used the JHK photometric and optical spectroscopic ob-
servations from Raj et al. (2017), and MIR photometry at 7.7, 8.8 and 12.4 µm
reported by Kawakita et al. (2017). Photoioinization modeling of the nebular spec-
trum on 2015 May 8 (Raj et al. 2017) with a resolution of about 3Å using the
COSMOS long slit spectrograph at CTIO is done to estimate the physical param-
eters of the nova ejecta. This spectrum has been smoothed to reduce the noise.
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) plots are made to estimate the dust tempera-

3. CLOUDY modeling

We have used the photoionization code CLOUDY, C13.04 (Ferland et al. 2013)
to model the nebular phase spectrum of V2676 Oph taken on 2015 May 8, 1138
days after outburst. We have chosen the nebular spectrum as there will be minimum
dust emission at this stage which can otherwise contaminate the emission from
other elements. The modeled spectrum is compared with the observed spectrum
and the elemental abundances, density, source luminosity, source temperature and
the ejected mass are estimated.

We deﬁne a set of parameters that specify the initial physical conditions of the
source and the ejected shell. These values are used by the photoionization code
CLOUDY to generate a synthetic spectrum by solving the equations of thermal and
statistical equilibrium from the non-LTE, illuminated gas clouds. These parameters
include the shape and intensity of the external radiation ﬁeld striking a cloud, the
chemical composition of the gas, and the geometry of the gas, including its radial
extent and the dependence of density on the radius. The density (hydrogen), radii,
geometry, distance, covering factor, ﬁlling factor and elemental abundances deﬁne
the physical conditions of the shell. The radial variation of hydrogen density, n(r)
and ﬁlling factor, f(r) is given by:

n(r) = n(r0)(

f (r) = f (r0)(

r
r0
r
r0

)α

)β

(1)

where r 0 is the inner radius, α and β are exponents of power laws. Here, α = -3 for
a shell undergoing ballistic expansion, and the ﬁlling factor power law exponent, β
= 0 similar to previous studies (Schwarz 2002; Vanlandingham et al. 2005; Helton
et al. 2010; Das & Mondal 2015, Mondal et al. 2018).

We assume the geometry of the expanding shell to be spherically symmetric
and illuminated by the central source with a total luminosity of about 10 38 erg s −1
for the model. The free parameters, like hydrogen density, effective blackbody tem-
perature and abundances of the elements seen in the observed spectrum e.g. He, O,
S and Ar (remaining elements ﬁxed at solar values) are varied to obtain the best-ﬁt
parameters. We assume the ejecta to comprise of two different density regions, the
higher density to ﬁt the low ionization lines, and the lower density to ﬁt the high
ionization lines, as the ejecta is non-homogeneous in density. The covering factor
is set in both the regions such that the sum is always less than or equal to 1. Most
of the parameters are kept constant in both the regions, so that the number of free
parameters from both the regions could be reduced. The modeled line ratios are

Vol. 68

3

obtained by adding the line ratios of each region after multiplying by its covering
factor. The inner and outer radii of the ejected shell are set by minimum and maxi-
mum expansion velocities obtained using the FWHM of the emission lines (400 to
2380 km s −1 ) similar to the study by Helton et al. (2010), and the time (t = 1138
day).

As CLOUDY uses many parameters which are interdependent to generate a spec-
trum, it is difﬁcult to validate the ﬁnal spectrum visually (Fig. 1). Thus, the best ﬁt
model is obtained by calculating χ2 and reduced χ2 :

σi is the error in observed ﬂux ratio
n – number of observed lines
n p – number of free parameters
ν = n - n p , degrees of freedom.
The observed and modeled ﬂux ratios with the χ2 values are given in Table 1.

To match the predicted luminosities with the reddening-corrected observed
ﬂux, we assume a distance of ∼ 7 kpc for V2676 Oph. The measured line ﬂuxes
were dereddened for E(B - V ) = 0.93 (Raj et al. 2017) and compared with the
output to calculate χ2 for the best ﬁt. The errors associated with ﬂux calibration
for different wavelength regions are minimized from ﬂux ratios of the modeled
and observed prominent hydrogen lines, e.g., Hα in the optical region. Using the
following relation (e.g., Schwarz et al. 2001; Schwarz 2002; Das & Mondal 2015):

Mshell = n(r0) f (r0)

the ejected mass is found to be 1.42×10 −5 M ⊙ . The ejected mass is calculated for
both the dense and diffuse regions, then multiplied by the corresponding covering
factors and added to obtain the ﬁnal value. The ejected mass estimated from this
method is consistent with the values found by Raj et al. (2017). Using the relation
below by Williams (1994),

we ﬁnd that the optical depth τ of the ejecta for [O I]λ6300 is 0.60 which is
close to 0.49 obtained from CLOUDY. The electron temperature varies from 11237

order of 10 7 cm −3 from the best-ﬁt model.

The abundance values and other parameters obtained from the model are given
in Table 2 in logarithm scale. The derived values indicate that the helium, argon,
oxygen and sulphur abundances are all enhanced relative to solar. These abundance
values are approximations to the true values because the calculation is based on
three or four observed lines only. The abundance solutions are also sensitive to
changing opacity and conditions of the ejecta. Though the model has low value
of reduced χ2 , it provides only a rough estimate of abundances. The Paschen
lines are overestimated. Also, lack of multi-wavelength spectra results in possibly
not-so-accurate abundance values. However, the model gives estimates of several
parameters including temperature, luminosity, ejected mass, opacity (see Table 1
and 2) which are in the range of values expected from Fe-II novae.

J-H and H-K colors, dust temperature and mass

The optical and near-IR spectrophotometric evolution of nova V2676 Oph pre-
sented in Raj et al. (2017) clearly showed the dust formation about 90 days since
outburst (Fig 1. Raj et al. 2017). We study here the IR color evolution to under-
stand the nature of the dust. Fig. 2 shows the J-H and H-K colors spanning a period
of ∼ 500 days. The J-H and H-K colors reached a maximum value of ∼ 4.5 mag at
155 days and ∼ 3.8 mag at 170 days, respectively, from the outburst. The observed

NIR excess suggests that a large amount of optically thick dust formed in the nova
ejecta. We compare these values with the other molecule and dust forming novae in
recent times and ﬁnd that these may be the largest J-H and H-K values observed so
far (see Table 3). After reaching a peak, the J-H and H-K colors started to show a
downward trend, which indicate destruction of the dust molecules due to radiation
from the central source. Another nova, V1324 Sco has shown gamma-ray emission
as well as dust formation (but no molecule formation) had similar colors, J-H = 4.9
and H-K = 3.4 (Finzell et al. 2018) as seen in V2676 Oph.

A sharp fall in the optical light curve about 90 days after the outburst clearly
indicate the onset of the dust formation (Raj et al. 2017). We expect to see a rise
in the JHK band magnitudes during dust formation (sharp fall in the optical), but
the JH bands show smaller drop and a ﬂattening in K band after 90 days. This
indicate the self-absorption in the JHK bands i.e. varying extinction in these bands
so we can not use the JHK magnitudes to construct the SED for estimating the dust
temperature and mass during this time period. Therefore, we use the observed HK
magnitudes on 2013 June 20 (day 452), K magnitude on 2014 May 16 (day 782)
and the IR photometric observations from Kawakita et al. (2017), to construct the
SED of the dust component in the ejecta (see Fig. 3). The thermal emission from
the dust is seen increasing up to the K band and it peaks at even longer wavelengths.
We estimate the temperature of the dust shell on these two epochs as 700 ± 100 K
and 400 ± 100 K, respectively. However, the estimate of temperature for the dust
shell may have a large uncertainty as we have used only ﬁve and four wavelengths,
respectively, to ﬁt the SED and the dust might be contributing at larger wavelengths
beyond 12.4 µm. The mass of the dust shell is calculated from the thermal compo-
nent of the SED of 2013 June 20 shown in Fig. 3 (upper panel). Here we assume
that the dust is mainly made of carbon particles (amorphous carbon has higher con-
densation temperature than astronomical silicates) having size less than 1 µm with
a density of 2.25 gm cm −3 . The expression given for the mass of the dust shell
in Woodward et al. (1993) and the distance range 6.9 - 7.9 kpc (Raj et al. 2017)
have been used to estimate the dust mass as M dust = (2.1-2.7) × 10 −8 M ⊙ . This
shows that a large amount of optically thick dust was formed between June 2012
to December 2012 in the nova ejecta. Note that we have estimated the mass of
the amorphous carbon only. This type of dust generally forms earlier when the
ejecta temperature is high. Kawakita et al. (2017) consider various combinations
of carbon and silicate dust.

5. Summary and Discussion

Using the CLOUDY code, physical parameters e.g. optical depth, electron
temperature, mass of the ejecta are estimated for V2676 Oph. Assuming a spherical
geometry of the ejecta consisting two different shells of different densities a set of
spectra are generated by varying several parameters. We compared the model-
generated spectra with observed spectra to estimate the best ﬁt parameters using χ2
technique. The WD temperature was estimated as 1.0 × 10 5 K having luminosity
of 1.0 × 10 38 ergs s −1 . The ejecta are signiﬁcantly enhanced, relative to solar, in
helium, argon, oxygen and sulphur. We estimate an ejected mass as 1.42 × 10 −5
M ⊙ which suggests that a low mass WD is associated with the nova V2676 Oph.
To understand the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) process which is responsible for
the nova explosion, it is very important to have a complete knowledge of elemental
abundances in the ejecta, the composition of accreted material on the WD as we

can’t rule out the possibility of mixing the ejecta with the WD material.

The J-H and H-K colors indicate a large reddening due to the dust formed in the
nova ejecta between June 2012 to December 2012. Kawakita et al. (2017) reported
carbon and oxygen-rich dust grains in the nova ejecta and they also pointed out that
hosting white-dwarf (WD) for V2676 Oph is CO-rich as no [Ne II] line at 12.8 µm
is detected in later stage. This is further supported by the slow evolution of the
light curve and large ejecta mass estimated in this paper. Typically the CO WDs
have lower mass compared to ONe WDs but the observed isotopic ratios of carbon
and nitrogen in V2676 Oph indicates large WD mass ∼1.15 M ⊙ for V2676 Oph
(Kawakita et al. 2017 and references therein). So, if one looks at the traditional
parameters e.g. light curve, ejecta mass, copious dust production then it seems that
the WD in V2676 Oph is a low mass CO WD. However, based on the observed
isotopic ratio of C and N, coupled with the latest TNR models (Jose & Hernanz
1998, 2007; Jose et al. 2006; Denissenkov et al. 2014 ), it seems that the WD
could be as massive as ∼1.15 M ⊙ . This stresses the importance of developing
better TNR models for the nova outburst. Similarly, the method of relying on just
the traditional parameters for determining the nature of the WD may need some
improvement.
