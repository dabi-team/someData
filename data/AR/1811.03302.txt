Three-dimensional Magnetic Reconnection Triggering an X-class
Conﬁned Flare in Active Region 12192
Ting Li1,2, Yijun Hou1,2, Shuhong Yang1,2 & Jun Zhang1,2

ABSTRACT

We present an extensive analysis of the X2.0-class conﬁned ﬂare on 2014 Oc-
tober 27 in the great active region AR 12192, observed by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The slipping motion
of the substructures within the negative-polarity ﬂare ribbon (R1) and contin-
ual reconnection-induced ﬂows during the conﬁned ﬂare are ﬁrst presented. The
substructures within ribbon R1 were observed to slip in opposite directions at ap-
parent speeds of 10-70 km s−1. The slipping motion exhibited the quasi-periodic
pattern with a period of 80-110 s, which can be observed since the ﬂare start
and throughout the impulsive phase of the ﬂare. Simultaneously quasi-periodic
ﬂows moved along a reverse-S shaped ﬁlament, with an average period of about
90 s. The period of reconnection-induced ﬂows is similar to that of the slippage
of ribbon substructures, implying the occurrence of quasi-periodic slipping mag-
netic reconnection. The spectral observations showed that the Si iv line was
blueshifted by 50-240 km s−1 at the location of the ﬂows. During the process of
the ﬂare, the ﬁlament did not show the rise phase and was not associated with
any failed eruption. The ﬂare mainly consisted of two sets of magnetic systems,
with both of their east ends anchoring in ribbon R1. We suggest that the slipping
magnetic reconnection between two magnetic systems triggers the conﬁned ﬂare.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares are explosive manifestations of magnetic energy in the solar corona (Forbes
et al. 2006). The eruptive ﬂares are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that

constitute major drivers for space weather (Svestka & Cliver 1992). The conﬁned ﬂares are
not accompanied by CMEs, however, they are important to reveal the physical nature of
solar ﬂares and the relationship between ﬂares and CMEs.

Many previous studies have attempted to explain why a ﬂare develops into a conﬁned
event (Gorbachev & Somov 1989; Schmieder et al. 1997; Nindos & Andrews 2004; Yang et
al. 2014; Dalmasse et al. 2015; Jing et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2014). Among the reported
conﬁned ﬂares, one category is related to loop-loop interactions, which will not lead to CMEs
due to the absence of a ﬁlament or ﬂux rope as the seed of a CME (Green et al. 2002; Sui
et al. 2006; Ning et al. 2018). This kind of conﬁned ﬂares often shows brightenings in
compact loop system, and has short time scales (e.g., on the order of a few minutes) and
small size scales (Pallavicini et al. 1977). The other category of conﬁned ﬂares is attributed
to high strength and low decay index of the background magnetic ﬁeld that prevent magnetic
energy release (Fan & Gibson 2007; Cheng et al. 2011; Zuccarello et al. 2017), and either
the ﬁlament fails to erupt (Ji et al. 2003; Guo et al. 2012; Kushwaha et al. 2015) or the
ﬁlament successfully erupts and no material is ejected into the interplanetary space (Yang &
Zhang 2018; Li et al. 2018). T¨or¨ok & Kliem (2005) simulated a conﬁned eruption driven by
the kink instability of a coronal magnetic ﬂux rope, and suggested that the gradual decrease
of the overlying ﬁeld with height was a main cause of conﬁned ﬂares. Wang & Zhang (2007)
statistically investigated the X-class ﬂares occurring during 1996−2004 and found that the
conﬁned ﬂares (about 10%) occurred closer to the magnetic center, which implied that a
stronger overlying constraining ﬁeld may determine whether a ﬂare is conﬁned.

Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the fundamental process that converts the stored
magnetic energy into kinetic energy of accelerated particles and plasma and thermal energy
during a ﬂare (Priest & Forbes 2002). In the classical 2D picture, magnetic reconnection can
occur at null points, where the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes (Lau & Finn 1990; Wang 1997). In 3D,
the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; D´emoulin et al. 1996), i.e., thin layers characterized by
very strong magnetic connectivity gradients, are also preferred sites for current accumulation
and energy dissipation (Mandrini et al. 1997; Pontin et al. 2016). In the 3D reconnecting
mode, magnetic ﬁeld lines “slip” or “ﬂip” inside the plasma due to the continuous exchange of
magnetic connectivity, and thus the magnetic reconnection occurring in the QSLs is referred
as slipping magnetic reconnection if the speed of slipping motion is sub-Alfv´enic (Priest
& D´emoulin 1995; Aulanier et al. 2006). The footprints of the QSLs have been shown
to coincide with the observed ﬂare ribbons (D´emoulin et al. 1997; Dalmasse et al. 2015;
Savcheva et al. 2015). The motions of ultraviolet (UV) brightening along the ribbons
are considered as important signatures of slipping magnetic reconnection along the QSLs
(Aulanier et al. 2006; Janvier et al. 2013). In recent years, several studies have found the
evidence of slipping magnetic reconnection during eruptive ﬂares (Dud´ık et al. 2014, 2016;

– 3 –

Li & Zhang 2014, 2015; Zheng et al. 2016; Jing et al. 2017). Li et al.
(2015) showed
the quasi-periodic slipping motion of bright kernels within ﬂare ribbons, suggestive of the
occurrence of quasi-periodic slipping magnetic reconnection during an eruptive ﬂare. Dud´ık
et al. (2016) presented that the ﬂare loops slipped in opposite directions along ﬂare ribbons,
consistent with the prediction of the standard solar ﬂare model in 3D (Aulanier et al. 2012;
Janvier et al. 2014).

Until now, the detailed signatures of slipping magnetic reconnections have been pre-
sented only in eruptive ﬂares. How about the conﬁned ﬂares? Can the slipping magnetic
reconnection trigger the conﬁned ﬂares? Why does the ﬂare develop into a conﬁned event? In
this paper, based on the observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ;
De Pontieu et al. 2014) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012),
we investigate in detail the features of the 3D reconnection process during a conﬁned X2.0
ﬂare on 2014 October 27 in the great solar active region (AR) 12192. Especially, the slipping
motion of the substructures within a ﬂare ribbon and continual reconnection-induced ﬂows
during the conﬁned ﬂare are ﬁrst presented.

NOAA AR 12192 was the biggest sunspot region in solar cycle 24, and it produced 6 X-
class ﬂares, 22 M-class ﬂares, and 53 C-class ﬂares during its disk passage. Interestingly, all
the X-class ﬂares in the AR are conﬁned ﬂares and not associated with any CMEs. Previous
studies showed that AR 12192 exhibited weaker non-potentiality and stronger conﬁnement
from the overlying magnetic ﬁeld, which determine the poor CME productivity of the AR
(Sun et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016; Sarkar & Srivastava 2018). However,
Zhang et al. (2017) suggested that the complexity of the involved magnetic ﬁeld structures
may be responsible for the conﬁned nature. The strongest X3.1-class ﬂare on 2014 October
24 has been extensively studied by using nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolations
and numerical simulations. Inoue et al. (2016) and Jiang et al. (2016) suggested that the
AR was composed of multiple weak-twisted ﬂux tubes and the tether-cutting reconnection
between these sheared arcades triggered the X3.1-class ﬂare. Prasad et al. (2018) attributed
the ﬂare onset to the null-point reconnections in a fan-spine topology, and they found no ﬂux
rope was involved in the ﬂare. Contrarily, a magnetic ﬂux rope was present in the numerical
simulation of Amari et al. (2018), who suggested that a strong magnetic cage of overlying
ﬁeld could explain the conﬁned nature.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the IRIS and SDO
observations and the methods of data analysis. Section 3 presents the dynamic evolution of
ﬂare loops and ribbons, and the ﬂows along a non-eruptive ﬁlament. Finally, in Section 4,
we discuss and summarize our work.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

In this study, we focus on the last X-class ﬂare in AR 12192 occurring near the west
limb (S18◦, W57◦) on 2014 October 27. The event has been analyzed by Polito et al. (2016),
who investigated the dynamics of the chromospheric plasma at the ﬂare kernels. The soft
X-ray light curve from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES) 1−8 ˚A
channel shows that the X2.0-class ﬂare started at 14:12 UT, peaked at 14:47 UT and ended
at 15:09 UT. The IRIS performed an eight-step coarse raster observation from 14:04 UT to
17:44 UT, with the step of 2′′, giving a total ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 14′′× 119′′ for the spectra.
The step cadence of the spectral observation was ∼3.2 s and each raster lasted for about 26
s. The IRIS slit jaw images (SJIs) were taken at a cadence of 13 s in the wavelengths 1330
˚A (at steps 0, 4), 2796 ˚A (at steps 1, 5) and 2832 ˚A (at steps 3, 7). The spatial pixel size of
the images is ∼0′′.332. We mainly use the 1330 ˚A SJIs to investigate the detailed evolution
of ﬂare ribbons. The 1330 ˚A ﬁlter records emission mainly from the UV continuum and two
C ii lines, which are formed in the lower transition region (TR) with a temperature of about
25000 K (Tian et al. 2014). The spectral observations of Si iv 1402.77 ˚A window are mainly
analyzed in our study. The Si iv 1402.77 ˚A proﬁle samples gas at ∼80000 K equilibrium
temperatures in the middle TR (Peter et al. 2014). We apply the single-Gaussian ﬁt to
obtain the Doppler shift and the line width (1/e width). The non-thermal width is also
calibrated by assuming the thermal broadening of 6.88 km s−1 (Te=80000 K of Si iv line)
and the instrumental broadening of 4.1 km s−1 (De Pontieu et al. 2014).

We also use the E(UV) images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et
al. 2012) and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the SDO. The AIA instrument observes the Sun in 10
UV/EUV ﬁlters with the cadences of 24/12 s and the pixel size of 0′′.6. We focus on several
diﬀerent ﬁlters including 1600, 304, 171 and 131 ˚A to fully understand the dynamic evolution
of the ﬂare and a non-eruptive ﬁlament during the ﬂare. The HMI LOS magnetograms are
used to reveal the magnetic structures where ﬂare ribbons are located. We co-align the AIA
images and IRIS 1330 ˚A SJIs by identifying the characteristic features.

3. Results

3.1. Overview of the Event

As shown from the high-temperature 131 ˚A observations (about 11 MK; O’Dwyer et al.
2010), the ﬂare loops displayed a clear “X shape” in the initial stage of the ﬂare (Figures
1(a) and (b); also see the animation of Figure 1). Two curved ﬂare ribbons R1 and R2 were

– 5 –

formed as seen in 1600 ˚A images (Figure 1(d)). The east footpoints of the X-shaped ﬂare
loops were located at ribbon R1 and their west footpoints anchored in ribbon R2. Then the
east footpoints of the “X-shaped” structure S1 elongated northward and meanwhile another
large-scale structure S2 appeared, connecting ribbon R1 and a new ribbon R3 (Figures 1(b)
and (e)). Afterwards, the east footpoints (R1) of the structure S2 slipped towards the south
while the west footpoints (R3) slipped in the opposite direction (red arrows in Figure 1(c)).
The comparison of 1600 ˚A images with HMI LOS magnetograms showed that ribbon R1 was
located at the negative-polarity sunspot, ribbon R2 at the leading positive-polarity ﬁelds of
the AR, and ribbon R3 anchoring at the peripheral positive-polarity ﬁelds (Figure 1(f)).

3.2. Dynamics of Flare Loops and Flare Ribbons

The 171 ˚A and 304 ˚A observations showed that a “reverse S-shaped” ﬁlament existed
between the two ﬂare ribbons R1 and R2 (Figures 2(a)-(b); also see the animation of Figure
2), with a length of about 70 Mm. The initial brightenings at the east part of the ﬁlament
appeared from about 8 min after the ﬂare onset (14:20 UT; see Figure 2(c)), indicating that
the reconnection during the ﬂare resulted in the brightenings and activation of the ﬁlament.
Then the entire ﬁlament was brightened and seemed to undergo a tiny torsional deformation
(Figure 2(d)). Continual mass ﬂows were observed from the middle part of the ﬁlament to
the east end (Figure 2(d)), implying the occurrence of magnetic reconnection between the
ﬁlament and the nearby magnetic structures. The ﬁlament showed no evident rise during
the whole event and still existed at the end of the ﬂare.

The detailed evolution of ﬂare ribbons can be obtained from the IRIS 1330 ˚A observa-
tions. The ribbon R1 showed an elongation motion towards the north almost from the ﬂare
start (red arrows in Figures 2(e)-(g)). Meanwhile, the bright substructures within ribbon R1
exhibited a slipping motion in the opposite direction (brown circles and arrows in Figures
2(f)-(g)). Associated with the elongation of the negative-polarity ribbon R1, the positive-
polarity ribbon R2 also showed an elongation motion towards the south (blue arrows in
Figures 2(e)-(g)). Simultaneously, the separation between ribbons R1 and R2 increased as
they moved away from the polarity inversion line. As ribbon R1 reached the eastern foot-
points of the ﬁlament, the ﬁlament material was illuminated in the 1330 ˚A image (Figure
2(g)) and continual reconnection-induced ﬂows were detected along the non-eruptive ﬁla-
ment (Figure 2(h)). The high-temperature ﬂare loops connecting the two ribbons R1 and
R2 were traced out in the 131 ˚A images (Figures 2(i)-(k)). Two ﬂare loops L1 and L2 com-
prised the “X shape” in the initial stage (Figure 2(i)), with their east end at ribbon R1 and
west end at ribbon R2. Associated with the elongation motions of ribbons R1 and R2 in

– 6 –

opposite directions, more ﬂare loops (L3 and L4 in Figures 2(j)-(k)) were traced out in the
131 ˚A observations. These ﬂare loops at diﬀerent times (Figure 2(k)) delineated a “bi-fan”
surface (Li & Zhang 2014), implying the complicated magnetic structure involved in the ﬂare
(Polito et al. 2016). The comparison of the 1330 ˚A and 131 ˚A images shows that the 1330 ˚A
substructures within the evolving ribbon are nearly cospatial with the footpoints of the 131
˚A loops. The relationship between the ﬂare kernels observed in 1600 ˚A or 1700 ˚A and the
high-temperature ﬂare loops has already been reported in Dud´ık et al. (2014, 2016). The
emission intensity of the ﬂare loops was enhanced signiﬁcantly as the ﬂare developed, and
the reconnection-induced ﬂows seemed to originate from the highly sheared location (Figure
2(l)).

The 1330 ˚A observations showed that the east ribbon R1 was composed of numerous
dot-like substructures, which slipped in opposite directions towards both ends of the ribbon
(Figure 3 and the associated animation). We followed the trails of 5 diﬀerent substructures
within ribbon R1 and displayed them in Figure 3. Almost from the ﬂare start, bright dot
“1” showed the apparent slipping motion towards the straight part (SP in panel (g)) of the
ribbon, with a displacement of about 12 Mm in 3 min and an average speed of 70 km s−1
(panels (a)-(c)). However, bright dots “2” and “3” slipped towards the hook of the ribbon
at a slower speed of about 20 km s−1 (panels (d)-(f)). Similarly, bright dots “4” and “5”
moved in opposite directions (panels (g)-(i)), and the bi-directional slippage can be observed
until the ﬂare peak time (panel (i)).

In order to analyze the slipping motions of the substructures, we obtain the stack plot
(Figure 4(a)) along slice “A−B” in 1330 ˚A images (red curve in Figure 3(g)). As seen
from the stack plot, multiple bright stripes were detected, with each stripe representing the
apparent slipping motion of one single substructure. The speed of the slipping motion was
about 20-30 km s−1 in the ﬁrst stage before 14:35 UT. Then the substructures within ribbon
R1 were illuminated again, implying the occurrence of two-step energy release in the event.
In the second stage after 14:35 UT, the majority of the substructures exhibited the slipping
motion from “B” to “A” and a small fraction was seen to slip in the opposite direction, with
apparent speeds of 10-40 km s−1. Along two horizontal slices (“H1” and “H2” in Figure
4(a)), we also obtain the intensity-time proﬁles (black and red curves in Figure 4(b)) at two
certain locations. The two proﬁles both showed the quasi-periodic pattern, indicating that
at the same location the substructure intermittently appeared and passed by. The average
period of the slipping motion was about 110 s in the ﬁrst stage and 80 s in the second episode.
The slipping motion lasted about 30 min and was observed throughout the impulsive phase
of the ﬂare (Figure 4(b)). The spatial size of the substructures was estimated as about 500
km (Figures 4(c)-(d)), comparable to the resolution limit of the IRIS instrument of about
480 km. The substructures observed in 1330 ˚A are larger than the ﬁne structures within Hα

– 7 –

ﬂare ribbons in another event (∼100 km in Sharykin & Kosovichev 2014). The diﬀerence
is probably caused by the low spatial resolution of the IRIS observations compared to the
high-resolution Hα images.

3.3. Reconnection-induced Flows Along the Non-eruptive Filament

About 8 min after the ﬂare onset (∼14:20 UT), the reverse-S shaped ﬁlament was
activated and continual mass ﬂows appeared from its middle part to the east end. Along the
main axis of the ﬁlament, we obtained two stack plots (Figures 5(c)-(d)) respectively along
slice “C-D” in 1330 ˚A images (red curve in Figure 5(a)) and slice “E-F” in 304 ˚A images
(blue curve in Figure 5(b)). As seen from the 1330 ˚A stack plot (Figure 5(c)), the mass ﬂows
started at about 14:20 UT and continued in the gradual phase of the ﬂare. The duration
of mass ﬂows was more than 40 min and the projected velocity in the plane of the sky was
50-75 km s−1. The ﬂows were generated intermittently and showed a quasi-periodic pattern
with an average period of about 90 s (brown cure in Figure 5(c)). In addition, at about
14:25 UT, a secondary ﬂare ribbon SR (Polito et al. 2016) appeared between ribbons R1
and R2 and elongated towards ribbon R2 at a speed of 90 km s−1 (Figures 5(a)-(c)). From
the 304 ˚A stack plot (Figure 5(d)), the long-duration ﬂows can also be clearly displayed,
which moved at a speed of 60-110 km s−1.

The IRIS spectral observations of Si iv 1402.77 ˚A line cover the east part of the ﬁlament
and the reconnection-induced ﬂows. The locations of Slit 0, Slit 4 and Slit 7 are focused on
(Figures 6(a) and (d)) and their spectral images of the Si iv 1402.77 ˚A line at two diﬀerent
times are displayed in Figures 6(b1)-(b3) and (e1)-(e3). The Si iv line exhibited evident
blueshifts at the locations of the ﬂows along the three slits. At 14:28:57 UT, the spectral tilt
was clearly visible at the location of Slit 0 (Figure 6(b1)), suggestive of the spinning motion
along the magnetic structure of the ﬁlament (Curdt et al. 2012; Li et al. 2014). The 1330
˚A SJIs show that the top edge of the intersection area between the slit locations and the
ﬁlament seems to be along the same ﬁne structure of the ﬁlament (FS in Figures 6(a) and
(d)). Three diﬀerent locations “A”, “B” and “C” along FS are selected, and their spectral
proﬁles and corresponding single-Gaussian ﬁts are shown in Figures 6(c) and (f). For the
location “A”, the calculated blueshift reached about 121 km s−1 and the non-thermal width
was 61 km s−1 at 14:28:57 UT (Figure 6(c)). For the locations closer to the reconnection
region (“B” and “C”), the blueshifts decreased and the non-thermal widths remained the
same. The blueshift at location “B” decreased to 82 km s−1 and location “C” at the west
had a blueshift of only 64 km s−1. At 14:38:17 UT, the blueshift at location “A” increased to
143 km s−1 with a large non-thermal width of about 150 km s−1 (Figure 6(f)). Similarly, the

– 8 –

Doppler shifts at the locations near the reconnection site are smaller than those locations
far away. The diﬀerence of Doppler shifts along the same ﬁne structure probably implies the
helical magnetic ﬁeld of the ﬁlament.

In order to analyze the temporal evolution of Doppler shifts and non-thermal widths at
the reconnection-induced ﬂows, we ﬁt the Si iv 1402.77 ˚A proﬁles and obtained the stack
plots of peak intensity, Doppler shift and non-thermal width along Slit 0 and Slit 4 (Figure 7).
Ribbon R2 showed an evident separation motion with a speed of about 18 km s−1, however,
ribbon R1 located in the sunspot did not show signiﬁcant displacement perpendicular to
the ribbon (Figures 7(a) and (d)). The Si iv emission exhibited obvious redshifts of 20-90
km s−1 at ribbon R2 (Figures 7(b) and (e)), suggestive of the chromospheric condensation
during the process of explosive chromospheric evaporation (Fisher et al. 1985; Zhang et
al. 2016; Li et al. 2017). At ribbon R1, the Si iv line was blueshifted by about 10-20
km s−1, probably due to the combination eﬀect of the chromospheric condensation and the
reconnection-induced ﬂows at the footpoints of the ﬁlament. About 8 min after the ﬂare
onset, the Doppler blueshifts and broadening at the location of ﬂows appeared, with the
blueshift of 50-240 km s−1 (Figures 7(b) and (e)) and the non-thermal width reaching about
60-120 km s−1 (Figures 7(c) and (f)). The blueshift lasted for more than 40 min and can be
observed throughout the impulsive and gradual phases of the ﬂare.

4. Summary and Discussion

We have presented an extensive analysis of an X2.0-class conﬁned ﬂare in AR 12192
on 2014 October 27. The ﬂare mainly consisted of two sets of magnetic systems, with
their east ends anchoring in the same negative-polarity ribbon (R1) above a sunspot umbra.
The west ends of the two magnetic systems were respectively located in other two positive-
polarity ribbons (R2 and R3). Using the IRIS high-resolution observations, we report the
apparent slipping motion of ribbon substructures along ribbon R1 in the TR. The majority
of the substructures exhibited the slipping motion towards the hook of ribbon R1 away from
the inversion line and a small fraction was seen to slip in the opposite direction towards
the straight part of R1, with apparent speeds of 10-70 km s−1. At the same location,
the substructures intermittently appeared with a period of 80-110 s, indicating the quasi-
periodic pattern of the slippage. The slipping motion can be observed since the ﬂare start
and throughout the impulsive phase of the ﬂare. A reverse-S shaped ﬁlament connecting
ribbons R1 and R2 was activated when the slippage along ribbon R1 reached the end of
the ﬁlament. Simultaneously continual reconnection-induced ﬂows moved along the ﬁlament
from its middle part to the east end, with a speed of 50-110 km s−1 in the plane of the

– 9 –

sky. The ﬂows were generated quasi-periodically with an average period of about 90 s. The
period of the ﬂows is similar to that of the slipping motion of ribbon substructures, implying
the occurrence of quasi-periodic slipping magnetic reconnection. The spectral observations
showed that at the reconnection-induced ﬂows the Si iv line was blueshifted by 50-240 km
s−1 and broadened with the non-thermal width reaching about 60-120 km s−1. The Doppler
blueshifts lasted for about 40 min and can be observed until the gradual phase of the ﬂare.
During the process of the ﬂare, the ﬁlament did not show evident rise phase and did not
erupt at all.

During this ﬂare, the magnetic ﬁeld line linkage has two basic sets of magnetic connec-
tivities (S1 and S2), with their east ends both anchoring in negative-polarity ribbon R1 and
their respective west ends in two positive-polarity ribbons R2 and R3. The bi-directional
slipping motion of ribbon R1 and the simultaneous elongations of ribbons R2 and R3 imply
the existence of a QSL surface between the two magnetic systems (S1 and S2). We suggest
that the magnetic reconnection occurs along the QSL and causes the continuous exchange
of connectivities of two magnetic systems S1 and S2, which results in apparent slippage of
the entire reconnecting ﬁeld lines. The QSL reconnection also generates the observed ﬂows
along the non-eruptive ﬁlament. According to the connectivity of the ﬁlament, we suggest
that the ﬁlament belongs to system S1. When the slippage of R1 reached the eastern end
of the ﬁlament, the slipping reconnection between ﬁeld lines of the ﬁlament and system S2
occurred along the QSL and caused the quasi-periodic ﬂows along the ﬁlament. A relevant
simulation study was carried out by Aulanier et al. (2005), who performed the MHD simu-
lations of the development of electric currents in bipolar conﬁgurations. In that study, two
sets of magnetic connectivities appeared in the bipolar potential conﬁgurations and slipping
magnetic reconnection occurred along the QSL between the two systems (see their Figure
3), similar to the magnetic topology in our observations.

The bi-directional slippage of the substructures within the same ﬂare ribbon in the TR
is ﬁrst reported in this study. We suggest that the slipping substructures in two directions
respectively correspond to the footpoints of two magnetic systems. The continuous slipping
magnetic reconnection between the two magnetic systems results in the exchange of their
connectivities and the slippage of reconnecting ﬁeld lines in opposite directions. Using the
SDO/AIA observations, Dud´ık et al. (2016) reported the apparent slipping motions of ﬂare
loops in opposite directions during an eruptive ﬂare. They interpreted the slippage towards
the ribbon hook corresponding to the ﬁeld lines of the erupting ﬂux rope and the slippage
in the opposite direction corresponding to the ﬂare loops, fullﬁlling the prediction of the
standard solar ﬂare model in 3D. Diﬀerent from their observations, there is no erupting ﬂux
rope involved in the analyzed conﬁned ﬂare and our observations can not be explained by
the 3D standard ﬂare model. Similar to the behavior of ribbons substructures in the TR,

– 10 –

the chromospheric knots within a ribbon-like structure have also been observed to move in
two directions towards both ends of the ribbon (Sobotka et al. 2016). These observations
imply that the energy release by slipping magnetic reconnection can aﬀect both the TR and
the chromosphere.

The quasi-periodic property of slipping kernels within ﬂare ribbons has been revealed
during an eruptive ﬂare by Li & Zhang (2015), and was further veriﬁed by Brosius & Daw
(2015) and Brannon et al. (2015). All these observations about the sawtooth oscillation of
ribbon substructures are for eruptive ﬂares, and the reported period range is between 90 s
and 300 s. In our observations, the small-scale substructures (∼500 km) within ﬂare ribbons
also exhibit the quasi-periodic slipping motion in the conﬁned ﬂare, and the oscillation
period of 80-110 s is similar to that during eruptive ﬂares. Recently, Parker & Longcope
(2017) proposed a model of the tearing mode instability and reproduced the observational
signatures of the sawtooth oscillation. They suggested that a tearing mode with asymmetric
shear ﬂow occurring at a current sheet produced ﬂuid motions similar to the observations.
Another explanation about the sawtooth oscillation of ribbon substructures is related to
the modulation of MHD waves (McLaughlin et al. 2009; Nakariakov & Melnikov 2009).
The MHD waves during the ﬂare may aﬀect the reconnection site and cause the oscillatory
magnetic reconnection.

The simultaneous imaging and spectroscopic observations of the reconnection-induced
ﬂows in the conﬁned ﬂare are presented in this work. The ﬂows moved along the QSLs at
a speed of 50-240 km s−1 in the impulsive and gradual phases of the ﬂare. Here, the ﬂows
should not be confused with the downﬂows along post-ﬂare loops due to the material cooling
after magnetic reconnections (Schmieder et al. 1996; Song et al. 2016). The appearance of
reconnection-induced ﬂows in conﬁned ﬂares diﬀer from that in eruptive ﬂares. In eruptive
ﬂares, bi-directional outﬂows are usually in forms of plasmoid ejections and contracting cusp-
shaped loops at speeds of about 100-300 km s−1 (Savage & McKenzie 2011; Liu et al. 2013),
comparable to the Doppler shifts of reconnection-induced ﬂows in our event. Moreover, the
ﬁlament involved in the ﬂare seemed to take part in the QSL reconnection, however, was still
present after the ﬂare. It did not show the rise phase and was not associated with any failed
eruption. The appearance of the ﬁlament and the reconnection-induced ﬂows could not be
explained by the classical picture of conﬁned ﬂares, either due to a failed ﬁlament eruption
(Ji et al. 2003; Kushwaha et al. 2015) or the loop-loop interaction (Green et al. 2002;
Ning et al. 2018). Thus the physical factors determining the likelihood of ejective/conﬁned
eruptions need to be revisited. We suggest that the QSL reconnection in complex magnetic
conﬁguration caused no signiﬁcant topological change, and thus the stability of the ﬁlament
was not destroyed and the ﬂare eventually developed into a conﬁned event.

Fig. 1.— Overview of the conﬁned X2.0 ﬂare on 2014 October 27 in AR 12192 including the
multi-wavelength images from SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI LOS magnetogram. The structure
S1 denotes the “X-shaped” ﬂare loops outlined by black and blue dashed curves. The red and
brown dash-dotted curves show another set of magnetic structure S2 involved in the ﬂare.
The red arrows in panel (c) represent the two opposite slipping directions of the footpoints
of structure S2. The duplications of structures S1 and S2 are also shown in panel (e). The
red rectangle in panel (d) shows the FOV of the images in Figure 2. R1, R2 and R3 are
three ﬂare ribbons, and their brightness contours in AIA 1600 ˚A image are shown in panel
(f). In the associated animation, the AIA 131 ˚A and AIA 1600 ˚A image animations start
at 14:05:20 UT and 14:05:04 UT, respectively. They end at 15:29:47 UT and 15:29:28 UT.
The HMI magnetograms are not included in the animation since the evolution of magnetic
ﬁelds is not evident during this period.

Fig. 2.— Multi-wavelength (E)UV images from the SDO/AIA and IRIS showing the dy-
namic evolution of the ﬂare. The AIA images are rotated by 90◦ counterclockwise to co-align
with the IRIS SJIs. The green dash-dotted curve in panel (b) outlines the ﬁlament involved
in the event. The red arrows in panels (e)-(g) show the slippage of ribbon R1 towards the
north, and the brown circles and arrows denote one of moving substructures within ribbon
R1 and its opposite slipping direction. Blue arrows in panels (e)-(g) denote the elongation
direction of ribbon R2. Dashed lines in panels (i)-(k) outline the high-temperature ﬂare
loops connecting ribbons R1 and R2, and dash-dotted lines are the duplicates of the ﬂare
loops at earlier times. The duplications of loops L2-L4 are also shown in panels (e)-(g). The
red rectangle in panel (h) shows the FOV of the 1330 ˚A images in Figure 3. The associated
animation includes IRIS 1330 ˚A, AIA 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A and 131 ˚A images from about 14:12 UT

Fig. 6.— Left column: IRIS 1330 ˚A SJI images displaying the slit locations and the ﬁne
structure of the ﬁlament (FS). Their FOV is the same as Figure 2. The red dotted lines
denote three slit locations S0, S4 and S7, and the diamonds (“A”, “B” and “C”) show three
selected locations along the structure FS of the ﬁlament. Middle column: spectral images of
the Si iv 1402.77 ˚A at the three slits as shown in panels (a) and (d). Right column: proﬁles
of the Si iv line at locations “A”, “B” and “C”. The solid curves are the observed proﬁles
and the dotted curves are single-Gaussian ﬁtting proﬁles.

Fig. 7.— Top row: temporal evolution of peak intensity, Doppler shift and non-thermal
width through ﬁtting the Si iv proﬁles along S0. The spatial range is along the Y axis in
Figures 6(a) and (d). The green contours are the Doppler blueshifts at the level of 80 km
s−1. Two dashed lines respectively denote the ﬂare start (14:12 UT) and peak time (14:47
UT). Bottom row: the same as the top row but for S4.
