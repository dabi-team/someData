ABSTRACT

The intensity of the O iv 2s2 2p 2P-2s2p2 4P and S iv 3 s2 3p 2P- 3s 3p2 4 P intercombination lines around 1400 Å observed with the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provide a useful tool to diagnose the electron number density (Ne) in the solar transition
region plasma. We measure the electron number density in a variety of solar features observed by IRIS, including an active region
(AR) loop, plage and brightening, and the ribbon of the 22-June-2015 M 6.5 class ﬂare. By using the emissivity ratios of O iv and S iv
lines, we ﬁnd that our observations are consistent with the emitting plasma being near isothermal (logT [K] ≈ 5) and iso-density (Ne
≈ 1010.6 cm−3) in the AR loop. Moreover, high electron number densities (Ne ≈ 1013 cm−3) are obtained during the impulsive phase of
the ﬂare by using the S iv line ratio. We note that the S iv lines provide a higher range of density sensitivity than the O iv lines. Finally,
we investigate the eﬀects of high densities (Ne & 1011 cm−3) on the ionization balance. In particular, the fractional ion abundances are
found to be shifted towards lower temperatures for high densities compared to the low density case. We also explored the eﬀects of a
non-Maxwellian electron distribution on our diagnostic method.

1. Introduction

from O iv and S iv around
The intercombination lines
1400 Å provide useful electron density (Ne) diagnostics in
a variety of solar features and astrophysical plasmas (see,
e.g., Flower & Nussbaumer 1975; Feldman & Doschek 1979a;
Bhatia et al. 1980a). These transitions are particularly suitable
for performing density measurements as their ratios are known
to be largely independent of the electron temperature, and
only weakly dependent on the electron distribution (Dudík et al.
2014). The other advantage is that these lines are close in wave-
length, minimizing any instrumental calibration eﬀects.

However, discrepancies between theoretical ratios and ob-
served values have been reported in the past by several authors.
For instance, Cook et al. (1995) calculated emission line ratios
from diﬀerent O iv and S iv line pairs by using solar observa-
tions from the High Resolution Telescope Spectrograph (HRTS)
and the SO82B spectrograph on board Skylab as well as stel-
lar observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. They found
that the observed ratios from O iv and S iv would imply elec-
tron densities which diﬀered signiﬁcantly with each other (by
up to an order of magnitude). Some of the discrepancies were
subsequently identiﬁed by Keenan et al. (2002a) as due to line
blends and low accuracy in the atomic data calculations. They
obtained more consistent density diagnostics from O iv and S iv
ratios by using updated atomic calculations together with obser-
vations from SOHO/SUMER. Nevertheless, some inconsisten-
cies still remained (Del Zanna et al. 2002).

There is now renewed interest in the literature concerning
these transitions, because some of the O iv and S iv intercombi-

nation lines, together with the Si iv resonance lines, are routinely
observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS;
De Pontieu et al. 2014) at much higher spectral, spatial and tem-
poral resolution than previously. For example, Peter et al. (2014)
used the intensities of the O iv vs. Si iv lines to propose that very
high densities, on the order of 1013 cm−3 or higher, are present in
the so-called IRIS plasma ‘bombs’. Line ratios involving an O iv
forbidden transition and a Si iv allowed transition have been used
in the past to provide electron densities during solar ﬂares and
transient brightenings (e.g., Cheng et al. 1981; Hanssen 1981).
However, the validity of using O iv to Si iv ratios has been hotly
debated because these ratios gave very high densities compared
to the more reliable ones obtained from the O iv ratios alone (see,
e.g., Hayes & Shine 1987). In addition, Judge (2015) recalled
several issues that should be taken into account when consid-
ering the Si iv/O iv density diagnostic. The main ones were: 1)
O iv and Si iv ions are formed at quite diﬀerent temperatures in
equilibrium and hence a change in the O iv / Si iv ratio could
imply a change in the temperature rather than in the plasma den-
sity 2) the chemical abundances of O and Si are not known with
any great accuracy and could be varying during the observed
events 3) density eﬀects on the ion populations could increase
the Si iv / O iv relative intensities by a factor of roughly 3–4.
Judge (2015) also mentioned the well-known problem of the
"anomalous ions", e.g., the observed high intensities of the Li-
and Na-like (as Si iv) ions (see also Del Zanna et al. 2002). An-
other important aspect to take into account is the eﬀect of non-
equilibrium conditions on the observed plasma diagnostics. It is
well-known that strong variations in the line intensities are ob-
tained when non-equilibrium ionisation is included in the numer-

Fig. 1. Example of a spectrum observed by IRIS in the AR 12356 (see Sect. 4.2) showing emission lines from the transition region. The ﬁgure
shows the O iv + S iv blend at around 1404.82 Å, and the wings of the O iv 1401.16 Å and S iv 1406.06 Å lines blending with photospheric cooler
transitions (S i and Fe ii respectively). In addition, we note that the shape of the IRIS line proﬁles for these ions is not Gaussian, but rather similar
to a generalized Lorentzian function.

ical calculations (see, e.g., Shen et al. 2013; Raymond & Dupree
1978; Mewe & Schrijver 1980; Bradshaw et al. 2004). In partic-
ular, Doyle et al. (2013) and Olluri et al. (2013) investigated the
consequences of time-dependent ionization on the formation of
the O iv and Si iv transition region lines observed by IRIS. In ad-
dition, Dudík et al. (2014) showed that non-Maxwellian electron
distributions in the plasma can substantially aﬀect the formation
temperatures and intensity ratios of the IRIS Si iv and O iv lines.
These authors also suggested that the observing window used by
IRIS should be extended to include S iv. Recent IRIS observa-
tion sequences have indeed included the S iv line near 1406 Å.
The S iv line ratios have a higher limit for density sensitivity than
the O iv line ratios and are thus particularly useful for diagnosing
high densities which might occur in ﬂares. Previous ﬂare studies
have in fact reported line ratios involving O ions which lay above
the density sensitivity range, indicating an electron density in the
excess of 1012 cm−3 (e.g., Cook et al. 1995; Polito et al. 2016).
We present here the analysis of several IRIS observational
datasets where Si iv, O iv, and S iv lines were observed. We focus
on the diagnostics based on the O iv and S iv lines which we
believe to be more reliable than those involving the Si iv to O iv
line ratios, because of the issues described above.

The observations used in this work were obtained from a va-
riety of solar features. Small spatial elements were selected, to
reduce multi-thermal and multi-density eﬀects. Discrepancies in
density diagnostics can in fact also arise if regions of plasma at
diﬀerent temperature and density are observed along the line of
sight (Doschek 1984; Almleaky et al. 1989). We discuss in some
detail the various factors that aﬀect the density measurements,
and their uncertainties, as well as the diﬀerent methods to obtain
densities.

We start by describing in Sect. 2 the spectral lines and atomic
data used in our analysis. We refer the reader to the Appendix

Article number, page 2 of 21

A for a detailed review of the issues related to the atomic data
and wavelengths for these lines. In Sect. 3 we brieﬂy discuss the
diagnostic methods. In Sect. 4 we analyse a loop spectrum ob-
served in Active Region (AR) NOAA 12356 on the 1 June 2015
and a spectrum acquired at the footpoints of the M 6.5 class ﬂare
on the 22 June 2015. The analysis of additional spectra observed
in the AR can be found in Appendix B. Sect.5 presents a dis-
cussion on some of the physical processes which can aﬀect the
formation temperature of the ions studied in this work. Finally,
the results of our analysis are discussed and summarized in Sect.
6.

2. Transition-region lines observed by IRIS

Tab. 1 lists the O iv, S iv and Si iv transition region (hereafter,
TR) lines observed by the IRIS FUV spectrograph which have
been analysed in this study. We note that in this context, TR in-
dicates an approximate temperature of formation for emission
lines rather than a layer of the solar atmosphere. An example of
an IRIS AR spectrum showing these lines is given in Fig. 1. It
is important to note that the IRIS spectral window has recently
been extended to include the 3s2 3p 2P3/2–3s 3p2 4P5/2 S iv tran-
sition at 1406.06 Å.

The O iv and S iv density-sensitive intensity ratios discussed

in this work are:

R1 =

IO iv(1399.78 Å)
IO iv(1401.16 Å)

R2 =

IO iv(1401.16 Å)
IO iv(1404.81 Å)

(1)

(2)

V. Polito et al.: Density diagnostics derived from the O iv and S iv intercombination lines observed by IRIS

noted by e.g. Feldman & Doschek (1979b). The ratio R2 involv-
ing the 2P3/2–4P3/2 O iv component at 1404.81 Å is in principle
better, but unfortunately this line is blended with the S iv 3s23p
2P1/2–3s 3p2 4P1/2 transition at 1404.85 Å (see Table 1). Various
methods have been considered to address this issue in the past.
Feldman & Doschek (1979a) discussed how the importance of
the S iv to the O iv line in the blend varies with the plasma den-
sity and temperature. For instance, at the quiet Sun density of
1010 cm−3, the S iv transition only contributes by around 10%
to the 1404.82 Å (bl) line. The ratio between the S iv and O iv
blended lines is however signiﬁcantly higher (≈ 50 %) at densi-
ties of the order of 1012 cm−3.

In this work, we estimate the intensity of

the O iv
1404.81 Å line by dividing the intensity of the unblended O iv
1401.16 Å line with the value of the theoretical R2 ratio at the
density Ne which is determined by using the R1 ratio:

IO iv(1404.81 Å) =

IO iv(1401.16 Å)
R2

(4)

The intensity of the blended S iv line at 1404.85 Å is
then simply obtained as the diﬀerence between the intensity
of the 1404.82 Å blend and the estimated intensity of the O iv
1404.81 Å line:

IS iv(1404.85 Å) = IO iv+S iv(1404.82 Å) − IO iv(1404.81 Å)

(5)

Finally, we compare the results obtained by using R1 R2, R3

and the Si iv / O iv ratio R4:

R4 =

ISi iv(1402.77 Å)
IO iv(1401.16 Å)

(6)

However, we bear in mind that this latter ratio is known
to imply much higher densities than the R1,2,3 ratios because
of the issues outlined in the introduction (see in particular
Hayes & Shine 1987).

2.1. Atomicdata, blends and wavelengths

Various inconsistencies in the electron densities obtained from
the O iv and S iv have been reported in the literature (see Ap-
pendix A). The main ones are removed with improved atomic
data (see Keenan et al. 2002a); however, some still remain, es-
pecially regarding the 1404.8 Å blend (Del Zanna et al. 2002),
which is about 30% stronger than predicted. This discrepancy

oretical ratios. The vertical lines indicate the high-density limit of 1012
cm−3 for the O iv ratios and 1013 cm−3 for the S iv ratios.

(3)

The above ratios are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of electron
density. They have been obtained by using the atomic data de-
scribed in Sect. 2.1. The ratios R1, R2 and R3 are useful density
diagnostics in an intermediate density interval, between lower
and higher densities (1010–1012 cm−3 for O iv and 1011–1013
cm−3 for S iv).

One limitation in the use of these lines is that they are nor-
mally observed to be extremely weak (the O iv 1399.779 Å line
in particular). In addition, the variation of the R1 ratio over the
density sensitivity range is not very large, and only spans around
a factor of two in magnitude (top panel of Fig. 2), as already

prompted a new S iv calculation by the UK APAP network1,
presented in Del Zanna & Badnell (2016). Here, we use these
S iv new atomic data, but we note that these data diﬀer from
the previous ones, available within the CHIANTI v.8 database
(Del Zanna et al. 2015), by only about 10%. In particular, the ex-
citation rates that drive the level population of the 3s 3p2 4P lev-
els are within a few percent of those calculated by Tayal (2000),
while variations in the A-values as calculated by diﬀerent au-
thors vary by at most 10%. Therefore, we estimate an uncer-
tainty in the intensity ratios of the S iv intercombination lines to
be about 10%. This however means that the 30% discrepancy in
the 1404.8 Å blend is still present even if the new atomic data of
Del Zanna & Badnell (2016) are used.

For the O iv transitions, we use the UK APAP network
data (Liang et al. 2012) as distributed within the CHIANTI v.8
database (Del Zanna et al. 2015). In Appendix A, we describe
some of the earlier atomic data, and provide a Table of A-values,
where we can see that variations are well within 10%. Therefore,
as in the S iv case, we estimate an overall uncertainty in the in-
tensity ratios of the intercombination lines to be about 10%. Fi-
nally, for the Si iv transition at 1402.77 Å, we use the atomic data
from CHIANTI v.8.

Another important issue is presented by possible blends in
the emission lines under study. The O iv lines are sometimes ob-
served to be blended with cooler emission lines, as described
by Young (2015). Polito et al. (2016) noted that the O iv lines
at 1399.78 Å and 1401.16 Å were blended with several photo-
spheric lines, some of them unidentiﬁed, during the impulsive
phase of an X class ﬂare. Keenan et al. (2002a) suggested that
Fe ii lines are blended with the S iv 1406.06 Å transition. The
presence of two Fe ii lines (at 1405.61 Å and 1405.80 Å) on
the blue side of the S iv 1406 Å line is indeed conﬁrmed in
some of the observed spectra in this study, see Sect. 4.1 and
Fig. 1. We also note that in some previous observations (e.g.
SOHO/SUMER, see Keenan et al. 2002a), some of the lines
were blended with second-order lines, an issue not present in the
IRIS data. To avoid any source of error in our analysis, we care-
fully investigated the possibility of line blends in the observed
O iv and S iv spectra and included possible blends as an addi-
tional uncertainty in the line intensity measurement (see Sect.
4.1).

Finally, we note that there has been some confusion in the lit-
erature regarding the wavelengths of the O iv and S iv lines. For
example, the wavelengths of the important O iv and S iv blended
lines around 1404.08 Å have been inverted in some cases. We
list in Table 1 our recommended wavelengths. The discussion on
these wavelengths is quite involved and given in Appendix A.

3. Density diagnostic method

In this work, we estimate the electron density Ne of the emit-
ting plasma by using an emissivity ratio method. This method
is based on comparing the observed intensity Iobs and the calcu-
lated contribution function Gth(T, Ne) of a set of optically thin
spectral lines as a function of Ne .

The function Gth, in units of phot cm3 s−1, is deﬁned as:

Gth(T, Ne) =

N(X+m
)
N(H)
j
N(X+m)
Ne
where N(X+m
)/N(X+m) is the population of the upper level j rel-
ative to the total number density of the ion X+m, calculated at

in a completely ionized plasma. The product A jiN(X+m
is obtained by using the CHIANTI v8 IDL routine emiss_calc
for a given temperature T and density Ne. We use photospheric
chemical abundances Ab(X) from Asplund et al. (2009) and frac-
tional ion abundances N(X+m)/N(X) from CHIANTI v8 and the
Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS)1 databases.

where C is a scaling constant depending on the geometry of the
source and on the units used. It is the same for all lines orig-
inating in the same plasma source. The emissivity ratio curves
presented in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 are normalized so that their
y–axis ranges between 0 and 1.

For an almost

iso-density plasma,

the ratios ER(T, Ne)
should then consistently intersect (within the errors) at the same
value, giving the density Ne of the emitting plasma source. This
method can be applied to spectral lines from the O iv and S iv
ions, which are formed at close values of temperature and there-
fore, in a constant-pressure plasma, at similar densities. For in-
stance, at formation temperatures of logT [K] ≈ 5.15 and 5.0 for
O iv and S iv respectively (as calculated in CHIANTI v.8 in ion-
ization equilibrium), we expect the densities of two ions to be

V. Polito et al.: Density diagnostics derived from the O iv and S iv intercombination lines observed by IRIS

close within a factor of ≈ 1.8. This factor is close to the uncer-
tainty, considering that even a small error in the observed ratio
would produce a spread in the estimated density value using the
theoretical ratio curves shown in Fig. 2.

The method described above is similar to the L-function
method suggested by Landi & Landini (1997), with the main dif-
ference that they used a Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM)
weighted temperature T0 to calculate Gth. Given the lack of suit-
able spectral lines to perform a DEM analysis in our observa-
tions, we use an alternative approach to estimate the average
plasma temperature T (see Sect. 4). Except for a density factor,
the emissivity ratio method used here is similar to the method
presented by Del Zanna et al. 2004; however, these authors ap-
plied it to spectral lines formed within a single ion (Fe x) only.
Therefore, they could ignore the chemical and ion abundance
factors in the deﬁnition of their emissivity ratio.

The advantage of using the emissivity ratio (Eq. 9) compared
to the individual intensity ratios R1,R2,R3 is that each line l is
considered independently, thus allowing a better identiﬁcation
of the presence of possible discrepancies or anomalies in the in-
tensity of a particular spectral line.

It is important to note that in Eq. 9, the Iobs is also a func-
tion of T and Ne present in the emitting source (Eq. 8). This is
especially the case if we are considering the blend at 1404.82 Å.
the intensity of the individual O iv 1404.81 Å and
Here,
S iv 1404.85 Å lines will depend on the density and temperature
assumed to deblend them (Eqs. 4–5).

In order to test the validity of our method, we ﬁrst simulated
several O iv and S iv synthetic spectra at known temperatures and
densities using the atomic data described in Sect. 2. We then
veriﬁed that by using the emissivity ratio method we were able
to recover the same plasma temperature and density chosen for
simulating the synthetic spectra.

Finally, various issues need to be considered when compar-
ing line intensities from diﬀerent ions. For example, chemical
abundances which are outlined below (Sect. 3.1). Some other is-
sues will be discussed in Sect. 5.

3.1. Chemical abundances

It has long been observed that some solar TR and coronal fea-
tures show variations in the chemical abundances, which are cor-
related with the ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP) of the element
(see, e.g., Laming 2015). The low-FIP (≤ 10 eV) elements are
more abundant than the high-FIP ones, relative to the photo-
spheric values (the FIP bias). Typical variations are of the or-
der of 3–4. In our analysis, we have adopted the photospheric
abundances recommended by Asplund et al. (2009). However,
we note that with coronal abundances the Si iv intensity would
increase compared to the O iv intensity. S has an FIP of about 10,
but it normally shows intensity variations in line with those of
the high-FIP elements such as O, and therefore we do not expect
large variations in the S/O abundance. It is interesting to note that
closed long-lived structures such as the 3 MK core loops in ac-
tive regions show consistently an FIP bias of about 3 (Del Zanna
2013; Del Zanna & Mason 2014), while newly emerged regions
normally show photospheric abundances. Unfortunately, IRIS
does not observe enough TR lines to measure chemical abun-
dances accurately.

As we shall see in Sect. 4, there is a consistency in the rela-
tive intensities of the IRIS O and S lines, independent of the fea-
ture observed. In particular, we have also examined the emission
in the sites of chromospheric evaporation during the impulsive

phase of ﬂares, where we would normally expect photospheric
abundances. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that the intensity of Si iv
relative to O iv and S iv is always very large and even increases in
the ﬂare spectra, which is the opposite of what we would expect
if the variations were due to an elemental abundance variation.
Si iv in fact behaves as an "anomalous ion" (see Del Zanna et al.
2002 and references therein). Non-equilibrium eﬀects such as
non-equilibrium ionization (e.g., Doyle et al. 2013) and non-
thermal electron distributions (e.g., Dudík et al. 2014) might be
responsible for this discrepancy (see also Sect. 5.2.).

4. IRIS observations of an active region and a ﬂare

IRIS is a complex instrument with two major components. It ac-
quires simultaneous spectra and images at very high temporal
(up to 2s) and spatial (0.33′′–0.4′′) resolution. The IRIS spec-
trograph observes continua and emission lines over a very broad
range of temperatures (logT [K] = 3.7–7), including the TR lines
under study (Tab. 1). Simultaneously, the IRIS Slit Jaw Imager
(SJI) provides high-resolution images in four diﬀerent passbands
(C ii 1330 Å , Si iv 1400 Å, Mg ii k 2796 Å and Mg ii wing
2830 Å).

In this study, we examine the spectra of O iv, S iv and Si iv
lines observed by IRIS in the non-ﬂaring AR NOAA 12356 on
1 June 2015 (see Fig. 3) and in AR 12371 during an M6.5 class
ﬂare on 22 June 2015. We use level 2 data downloaded from
the IRIS website 2, which are obtained from level 0 data after
ﬂat-ﬁeld, geometry calibration and dark current subtraction, as
detailed in the IRIS software notes 3. In addition, we used the
solarsoft routine despik.pro to remove the cosmic rays. The cal-
ibration of the wavelength scale was performed as described in
Polito et al. (2015, 2016).

We use IRIS spectroscopic data to measure the intensity Iobs
(expressed as data number (DN)) of the TR lines in diﬀerent ob-
served spectra. The intensities were then converted from DN to
physical units (erg s−1 sr−1 cm−2) by using the radiometric cali-
bration detailed in the IRIS technical note 26 3. In particular, the
updated version of the SolarSoft routine iris_get_response.pro
was used, which corrects the eﬀective areas to take into account
the instrumental degradation since launch. The errors associated
to the intensities are derived as described in the following sec-
tion.

4.1. Fittingthe IRIS line proﬁles

The line proﬁles observed in the AR under study (Sect. 4.2)
present a non-Gaussian shape with narrow core and broad wings
(Fig. 5). Such proﬁles could be ﬁtted well with two Gaussian
components (see Fig. B.1 in the Appendix B). We used the So-
larSoft routine xcﬁt to perform the ﬁtting. The error estimated by
the multi component ﬁtting in the xcﬁt routine takes into account
the errors (as standard deviations) associated to the parameters of
each Gaussian. Given the high number of free parameters in the
double Gaussian ﬁt, this error can be quite large, even though the
sum of the two Gaussians approximates the observed spectrum
well, as shown in Fig. B.1. In order to have an alternative estima-
tion of the errors associated to the observed intensities Iobs, we
compare the calibrated intensities obtained by the ﬁtting the line
proﬁles with two Gaussians to the intensities obtained by sum-
ming the total intensity under the line proﬁle. These errors are
typically less than 10% (see Tables B.1 and B.2 in Appendix B).

In both method (ﬁtting and sum) a background was subtracted
by the spectral window before measuring the line intensities.
This background can be estimated by averaging the counts over

blends of S i 1401.51 Å within the O iv 1401.16 Å line and
O iv 1404.81 Å with S iv 1404.85 Å (see Sect. 2). In particular,
in the plage spectrum (middle panel of Fig. B.1 in the Appendix
B) we can clearly distinguish the two Fe ii lines (see Sect. 2) and
the nearby the S iv 1406.06 Å line, ruling out any possible blend-
ing issue. For the plage and loop spectra, the diﬀerence between

the summed and ﬁtted intensities is very small (see Tables 2, B.1
and B.2 in the Appendix B); therefore we use the intensity val-
ues obtained by summing under the line proﬁles and assume a
maximum error of 10%.

In contrast, the spectra acquired in the AR bright point (see
Fig. 5 and bottom panel of Fig. B.1 in the Appendix B) show
broader proﬁles resulting in a worse ﬁt and an increased error
in the intensity estimation. In particular, it is not clear if the en-
hancements of the blue and red wings observed in some lines
(such as the S iv 1406.93 Å) might be due to a superposition
of ﬂows or to blending with other lines (such as Fe ii). In this
case, we only ﬁtted the main central component of the line pro-
ﬁle and the diﬀerence between summed and ﬁtted intensity is
higher (Tab.B.2 in the Appendix B ). Therefore, we assume an
error of 20% for the intensity in the bright point spectrum. Sim-
ilarly, a 20% error is associated to the line intensity values in
the ﬂare case study (Sect. 4.3), where the line proﬁles are of-
ten asymmetric and need to be ﬁtted with two or more Gaussian
components.

In Sect. 4.2 and 4.3 we present the analysis of the density
diagnostics for the AR 12356 and the M 6.5 class ﬂare on the
22 June 2015, respectively. We then discuss the results in Sect. 5
and 6.

4.2. Density diagnosticsin the ARNOAA 12356

The AR NOAA 12356 was visible during its passage on disk
from May 28 to June 10, 2015 and during this time it did not
show any major ﬂaring activity. Fig. 3 presents an overview of
the AR 12356 as observed by IRIS in the SJI 1400 Å ﬁlter.
This band is dominated by TR emission from Si iv at around
logT [K]=4.9 and shows several loop structures and compact
bright points. Movie 1 shows the evolution of the AR over time,
as observed in the SJI 1400 Å band. In particular, the movie
shows that these loops and brightenings evolve very dynamically
over time. The coloured box in Fig.3 indicates the ﬁeld of view
of the IRIS spectrograph monochromatic images shown in Fig.
4. The IRIS spectrograph was running a single raster over the
AR 12356 from 18:11 UT to 21:27 UT on the 1 June 2014. The
dense 96-steps raster ran from east to west over a ﬁeld of view
of 33′′ × 119′′. Every slit position had a 0.33′′ step size and an
exposure time of ≈ 60 s. Several CCD spectral windows were

mation of logT [K] = 5.15 and 5 for the O iv and S iv ions, respectively.
In the bottom panel, a temperature of logT [K] ≈ 5 is assumed instead
for both ions. The error bars include the propagation of a 10 % uncer-
tainty in both the line intensity and the atomic data.

The images in Fig. 4 show the intensity maps of the Si iv
1402.77 Å, O iv 1399.78 Å and 1401.16 Å, S iv 1406.06 Å spec-
tral lines observed during the IRIS raster. For each slit exposure,
the intensity at each detector pixel has been obtained by integrat-
ing the total counts (DN) over the line proﬁles and converting
them to physical units (phot · s−1 · arcsec−2 · cm−2).

We analyse three diﬀerent features in the AR 12356 where
the O iv and S iv lines were reasonably intense: a more steady
region that we call "plage", a "loop structure" and a brighten-
ing that we call "bright point". These regions are indicated in
Fig.4 by the yellow, light blue and red coloured boxes respec-
tively. The corresponding IRIS TR spectra (black, blue and red
lines) are shown in Fig. 5. The individual spectra are plotted in
Fig. B.1 (Appendix B), which also shows the double Gaussian
ﬁt. We note that the line proﬁles are much broader in the bright
point spectrum than in the loop and plage spectra, possibly due
to a superposition of diﬀerent ﬂows along the line of sight or
turbulent motion in the plasma. In addition, the relative inten-
sity of the observed lines (in particular of the 1404.82 Å blend
and the S iv 1406.06 Å) changes signiﬁcantly between the three
spectra. This is a consequence of the density variation between
diﬀerent regions. Movie 1 shows these features over time at high
spatial resolution with the IRIS SJI. In particular, the so-called

"plage" region seems to be made by small unresolved arch-like
structures.

In the following, we show detailed results for the loop region
only and we refer the reader to the Appendix B for the AR plage
and bright point analysis.

The top panel of Fig. 6 shows the emissivity ratios of each
IRIS TR line observed in the loop spectrum as a function of den-
sity, given by eq. 9 and described in Sect. 2. The intensity of the
blended O iv 1404.81 Å and S iv 1404.85 Å lines was obtained
as described in Eqs. 4 and 5. The temperature T used to calculate
Gth(T, Ne) in Eq. 7 is initially taken to be the temperature of max-
imum abundance for each ion from the fractional ion abundances
available in CHIANTI v.8; i.e., logT [K] ≈ 5.15 and 5.0 for O iv
and S iv respectively. It is important to note that these fractional
ion abundances are calculated in CHIANTI assuming a low elec-
tron number density, i.e., around 108 cm−3. As we mentioned in
Sect. 3, given the small diﬀerence in temperature of formation
of the two ions, if we assume pressure equilibrium, we expect
the O iv and S iv plasma to be formed at electron densities which
diﬀer by up to a factor of ≈ 1.8.

The two S iv and three O iv transitions in the top panel of
Fig. 6 show two distinct crossing points which would indicate
electron densities logNe [cm−3] of 10.70 and 11.34 respectively.
The density values obtained by using the separate O iv and S iv
ratios thus diﬀer of a factor by around 4, i.e., much higher than
expected assuming constant pressure. The error bars at the cross-
ing points represent the propagation of a 10% error in both the
line intensities and the Gth(T, Ne). We emphasize that estimating
the density from the crossing points of the O iv and S iv lines
separately is equivalent to applying the intensity ratio method
(Eqs. 1–3). We also note a signiﬁcant discrepancy between the
relative intensity of those ions taking into account the error bars.
A discrepancy in the relative line intensity is also found in both
the bright point and plage spectra (see Appendix B) as well as in
the ﬂare spectrum analysed in Sect. 4.3. We note that previous
studies (e.g., Keenan et al. 2002a) mainly focused on comparing
density diagnostics using the O iv and S iv ratios individually but
did not report any comparison on the relative intensity of spectral
lines from the two ions.

We rule out that the discrepancy in the relative intensity and
derived electron density values could be due to an underestima-
tion of the errors associated to either the atomic data or observed
intensities. In the Appendix A we show that atomic calcula-
tions from diﬀerent authors agree better than a 10%. Regard-
ing the intensity values, we note that the intensity of the O iv
1404.81 Å and S iv 1404.85 Å lines might indeed be aﬀected by
a larger error than the other unblended lines. However, the dis-
crepancy between the unblended O iv and S iv lines would still
remain. In addition, we emphasize that possible blends of the
O iv and S iv with the photospheric S i and Fe ii spectral lines do
not represent a major issue as discussed in Sect. 4.1. Finally, the
discrepancy is observed in all AR features studied as well as in
the ﬂare spectrum presented in Sect. 4.2, suggesting that diﬀer-
ences in O and S chemical abundances are unlikely to be the
main cause.

We recall that the emissivity ratio curves shown in the top
panel of Fig. 6 are obtained assuming that the O iv and S iv
ions are formed at the temperature of maximum ionization abun-
dance for each ion. We relaxed this assumption and investi-
gated whether we could ﬁnd a combination of a single density
and a single temperature values for the emitting plasma which
could reproduce the intensity of all the O iv and S iv lines in the
observed AR loop spectrum. Given the lack of suitable spec-

tral lines to produce a DEM distribution, we start by assuming
that the O iv and S iv plasma are nearly isothermal. This ap-
proximation can be justiﬁed by the fact that AR loops are of-
ten observed to show a very narrow distribution in their cross-
section (Del Zanna 2003; Warren et al. 2008; Brooks et al. 2012;
Schmelz et al. 2007). This seem to be particularly true for cooler
loops which tend to have narrower DEM distributions than hotter
loops (Schmelz et al. 2014, 2009). In Fig. 7 we show a 3D plot of
the emissivity ratio ER(T, Ne) as a function of T and Ne for just
the three unblended lines observed by IRIS: O iv 1339.77 Å and
1401.16 Å, and S iv 1406.06 Å. The 3D emissivity ratios consis-
tently intersect at a temperature of logT [K] ≈ 5.0 and a density
of logNe [cm−3] ≈ 10.6. Hence, we recalculate the Gth(T, Ne)
function at this latter value of temperature for each of the ob-
served IRIS TR lines. We note that the observed intensity Iobs
of the blended O iv 1404.81 Å line (and consequently of the S iv
1404.85 Å line) also changes slightly because it is now obtained
from Eq. 4 by taking R2 at the density logNe [cm−3] = 10.6 rather
than at the density estimated by the R1 ratio as previously.

The bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows the new emissivity ratio
curves obtained assuming the temperature and density values ob-
tained from the 3D emissivity ratios in Fig. 7. We note that the
discrepancy between the O iv and S iv intensities is now removed
and that all the lines, including the O iv at 1404.81 Å and the S iv
at 1404.85 Å, consistently indicate a near iso-thermal (logT [K]
≈ 5.0) and iso-density (logNe [cm−3] ≈ 10.6) plasma.

It is interesting to note that the analysis of the bright point
and plage spectra (see plots in the Appendix B) are also consis-
tent with the emitting plasma being isothermal and in all cases
formed at temperatures logT [K] ≈ 5.0.

In Tab. 3 (middle row) we compare the estimated density Ne
for the loop region obtained from the intensity ratios R1, R3 and
R4 (columns 2–4) and the ER method analysis presented above
(column 5, indicated as "A"). Column 6 shows the density val-
ues obtained from the ER method after taking into account the
Ne dependence in the fractional ion abundances of each ion (in-
dicated as ER method "B"). This latter method will be described
in detail in Sect. 5.1. Finally, columns 7 and 8 show the estimated
values of plasma temperature obtained by using the ER method
in the case A and B respectively. The same results for the plage
and bright point regions are also reported in the top and bottom
rows of Tab.3.

In Sect. 4.3 we perform a similar density diagnostic analysis
with spectra acquired during the impulsive phase of the 22 June
2015 ﬂare.

4.3. High density measurementsduring the 22 June 2015

M-class ﬂare

In this section, we focus on the M6.5 class ﬂare that occurred
in AR NOAA 12371 on 22 June 2015. The ﬂare started at about
17:23 UT and reached the maximum of the X-ray ﬂux at around
18:00 UT, as shown in the GOES light curves in Fig. 8. The
peak phase was followed by a long gradual phase until about
20:53 UT.

On 22 June 2015, IRIS was running several 16-step sparse
rasters observing the AR 12371 from 17:00 UT to 21:14 UT.
Each raster had a FOV of 15′′ × 119′′ and a cadence of 33 s,
with a single slit exposure time of just ≈ 2 s.

The left panel of Fig. 9 shows that the IRIS slit (vertical line)
intersected both northern and southern ribbons during the whole
evolution of the ﬂare. The right panel of Fig. 9 shows a spec-
trum of the Si iv 1402.77 Å window at the location where the

lected spectra where the line proﬁles were not strongly asymmet-
ric or contaminated by a high FUV continuum. Table 4 summa-
rizes the results of the density diagnostics by using the intensity
ratios R1, R3 and R4 and emissivity ratio method "A" when appli-
cable. In addition, the last two columns show the plasma density
and temperature obtained by using the ER method "B", i.e., tak-
ing into account the ionization balances in high density regime
(with ADAS), as described in Sect. 5.1.

The emissivity ratio methods ("A" or "B") cannot be applied
if R1 lies outside the density sensitivity limit of 1012 cm−3 (Fig.
2 top). In such cases however, the S iv ratio can still be used as
it is sensitive to densities up to 1013 cm−3 (Fig. 2 bottom). It is
important to note that the ratio R2 also reaches a statistical equi-
librium above 1012 cm−3 and it remains constant at the value of
around 6. Therefore, we can use this value to estimate the contri-
bution of the O iv 1404.81 Å line to the blend at 1404.82 Å from
Eq. 4 and thus obtain the intensity of the S iv line involved in the
R3 ratio (from Eq. 5).

It is important to note that at these high densities, the in-
tensity of the O iv 1404.81 Å (and thus S iv 1404.85 Å) line
obtained from R2 will not change with density as in the previ-
ous case of the AR loop presented in Sect. 4.2. The S iv ratio is
therefore a more reliable density diagnostic in the high density
regime (above 1012 cm−3).

The values of S iv ratios and corresponding densities over
time are shown in Tab. 4 and in Fig. 10 for the four selected spec-
tra. Fig. 10 shows that the density reaches a peak of above 1013
cm−3 during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare at about 17:59 UT.
It then drops dramatically by more than one order of magnitude
by around 18:02 UT, i.e., 2 minutes after the peak of the ﬂare
in the soft X-ray ﬂux. The fourth column of Tab. 4 shows the
density diagnostics obtained by using the Si iv/ O iv R4 ratio for
the four spectra analysed, except the one at 17:57:57 UT where
the Si iv line is saturated. Interestingly, the density diagnostics
from the Si iv/O iv and the S iv (R3) ratios seem to show better
agreement at two times (second and third row Tab. 4) during the
impulsive phase of the ﬂare compared to the lower density AR
case (Sect. 4.2). However, we note that at those two times the
intensity of the Si iv line is very large and only ≈ 5% below the
saturation threshold, which might aﬀect the intensity estimation.
In addition, opacity eﬀects may also cause a decrease in the Si iv
intensity (see Section 6).

At 18:02 UT, the density is again within the sensitive inter-
val of the O iv line ratios and we can thus apply the emissivity
ratio method. The top panel of Fig. 11 shows the emissivity ra-
tio curves for the O iv and S iv lines observed by IRIS during
the raster No. 110 at 18:02:28 UT. A very large discrepancy be-

slit was crossing the southern ﬂare ribbon at around 17:54 UT,
during raster No. 96 and at slit exposure No. 9. We note that the
relative intensity of the S iv line at 1406.06 Å and the O iv + S iv
blend at 1404.82 Å is signiﬁcantly larger compared to the AR
spectra presented in Sect. 4.2. This is a result of the increase in
the electron density.

We analyse four TR spectra at the same slit position No.9,
crossing the southern ﬂare ribbon during the impulsive and peak
phases of the ﬂare, where the TR lines are strong. We only se-

but it is lower than the temperature at which most of O iv plasma
is expected to emit in ionization equilibrium.

As we already mentioned in Sect. 4.2, cooler coronal loops
often show a near-isothermal distribution, so it is not surprising
to see this result for the TR loops. It is not obvious to us why
we should ﬁnd an isothermal temperature for the O iv and S iv
plasma also at the ﬂare ribbon, AR plage and bright point but
this does indeed seem to ﬁt the observed data well. As mentioned
above, the online movie 1 shows that the so-called "plage" region
is continuously ﬁlled with small and very fast loop-like struc-
tures. Hence, one possible explanation is that in all cases the
plasma we observe either originates from loop structures (AR
loop and possible the plage region) or loop footpoints (for the
ﬂare and bright point cases), which are both features where the
plasma is often observed to be near isothermal.

However, the predicted formation temperature of the ions is
uncertain. There are in fact several eﬀects that can shift the tem-
perature of formation of the ions, the most important ones being
brieﬂy summarised in Sect. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

5.1. Density effects on the ion abundance

The ion abundance can be obtained once the total eﬀective ioni-
sation and recombination rates are known. Most ion charge state
distributions found in the literature are in the so-called low-
density limit. Fractional ion abundances that take into account
density eﬀects were presented by Burgess & Summers (1969)
and Jordan (1969). In particular, there are two main eﬀects which
become important at high densities, the suppression of the di-
electronic recombination (DR), and the presence of metastable
states.

As shown by Burgess (1964), DR is far more important that
radiative recombination (RR). As ﬁrst calculated in detail by
Burgess & Summers (1969), DR becomes suppressed at high
densities. To derive appropriately the eﬀects of ﬁnite density on
the emissivity and so in particular on DR, complex Collisional-
Radiative (CR) modelling needs to be carried out. Results of

tween the relative intensities of these lines is evident. Hence, we
use an approach similar to the one presented in Sect. 4.2 and
try to determine whether the emitting plasma can be ﬁtted with
a diﬀerent value of temperature, starting from a near-isothermal
assumption for the two ions. Figure 12 shows a 3D emissivity
ratio plot. We ﬁnd that the ﬂare spectrum at 18:02 UT is consis-
tent with a plasma emission being isothermal at the temperature
of logT [K] ≈ 4.98 and density logNe [cm−3] ≈ 11.70. We then
re-calculated the Gth function at the newly estimated tempera-
ture and density, as explained in Sect. 4.2. The corresponding
new emissivity curves are plotted in the bottom panel of Fig. 11,
showing that the intensity of all the observed O iv and S iv lines,
including also the O iv 1404.81 Å and S iv 1404.85 Å, are indeed
consistent with a plasma being near iso-density and iso-thermal.

temperature

Sect. 4.1 and 4.2 show that the observations of O iv and S iv
transition lines are consistent with an isothermal assumption
and temperatures of about logT [K] ≈ 5.0 This value is consis-
tent with the temperature of the S iv maximum ion abundance

this modelling were published in a series of papers and reports
by H. Summers (see e.g., Summers 1974). However, approx-
imate cross-sections were used. For example, for the DR, the
Burgess approximate formula was used. Since then, more accu-
rate DR calculations in the low-density limit (the DR project,
see Badnell et al. (2003)) have been carried out. In addition,
Nikoli´c et al. (2013) have provided an approximate way to es-
timate the DR suppression by using the most recent DR rates
and comparing the relative suppression with that which was cal-
culated by H. Summers.

For several ions, signiﬁcant population is present in the
metastable states at high densities, hence ionisation and recom-
bination from these states also needs to be taken into account.
The role of metastable states and the eﬀects of ﬁnite density on
DR are considered within the generalised collisional-radiative
(GCR) modelling in ADAS (Summers et al. 2006).

Fig. 13 shows the fractional ion abundances for O iv, S iv and
Si iv obtained by using the eﬀective rate coeﬃcients for ionisa-
tion and recombination available in the OPEN-ADAS database1
(for O iv, the GCR model was used; for S iv, the CR model was
used). The continuous curves show the fractional ion abundances
calculated at low density values (Ne = 108 cm−3) while the dotted
lines show the results for higher densities (Ne = 1011−13 cm−3).
As already shown by (e.g., Vernazza & Raymond 1979), includ-
ing the eﬀects of DR suppression and the presence of metastable
levels results in a shift the formation temperature of TR ions
towards lower values. In a stratiﬁed atmosphere, lower temper-
ature plasma regions have a larger density which thus cause an
increase in the line intensities. This increase is particularly large
2, and
for allowed lines, whose intensity is proportional to Ne
might explain the anomalously high intensity of some of such
lines (such as the Si iv 1402.77 Å). In addition, Fig. 13 shows
that the values of the peak fractional ion abundances for Si iv
and S iv increase signiﬁcantly with density, contributing to an
additional increase in the intensity of those ions.

In order to estimate the eﬀect on the density diagnostics, we
applied the ER method to the AR loop and ﬂare observations
by including the density-dependent ADAS fractional ion abun-
dances in Eq. 7 . The results of density and temperature so ob-
tained are given in Tabs. 3 and 4 (indicated as ER method "B").
In both cases, the estimated plasma temperature is lower than
the temperatures that we obtained in Sect. 4 using fractional ion
abundances from CHIANTI (calculated at low density). In con-
trast, the density values do not change signiﬁcantly, showing that
the high density eﬀects on the ion abundances do not aﬀect the
density diagnostic results presented in Sect. 4, in the isothermal
approximation.

5.2. Non-equilibriumionisation

We note that IRIS does not observe spectral lines of successive
stages of ionisation of an element which would enable us to
study non-equilibrium ionisation in detail. The eﬀect of transient
ionization on the intensity of the O iv and Si iv lines observed
by IRIS at plasma densities of around 1010 cm−3 was recently
investigated by Doyle et al. (2013) and Olluri et al. (2013).
Those lines show a very diﬀerent response to transient ioniza-
tion because of their diﬀerent formation process. In contrast, the
S iv and O iv lines analysed in this work have similar atomic
structure (see Tab. 1) and therefore we expect them to behave in
a similar manner under non-equilibrium ionization.

In addition, the relatively high densities we expect and mea-
sure in the low TR where O iv is emitted in active regions (≈
1011 cm−3) and in the ﬂare under study (≈ 1013 cm−3), mean
that strong departures from equilibrium ionisation are not ex-
pected (c.f., Dzifˇcáková et al. 2016). At these densities, the typi-
cal ionisation/recombination timescales are in fact of the order of
1s (e.g., Smith & Hughes 2010), i.e. comparable to or less than
the IRIS exposure times. In particular, the exposure time of the
AR observation presented in Sect. 4.2 is around 60s, i.e., much
longer than the expected ionization/recombination timescales.
The non-equilibrium ionization could however still be present if
there are advective ﬂows carrying plasma from regions with dif-
ferent temperature (e.g., Bradshaw & Mason 2003; Olluri et al.
2013). We however do not detect any strong Doppler shifts, apart
from the systematic ≈ 5 km s−1 redshift in the quiet Sun TR (e.g.,
Brekke et al. 1997), in any of the observed O iv and S iv spectra
in the AR loop and ﬂare studies (see for example Fig. 5). The
O iv and S iv plasma should therefore be close to the ionization
equilibrium at the densities we observe in this work (above 1010
cm−3).

5.3. Non-thermal distributions

The presence of non-Maxwellian distributions with high-energy
tails, such as the κ-distribution, could signiﬁcantly shift the
formation temperatures of the TR lines towards lower tem-
peratures (Dzifˇcáková & Kulinová 2011; Dzifˇcáková & Dudík
2013). For a DEM decreasing with temperature, the Si iv line

Maxwellian distributions with diﬀerent values of κ, except for κ = 2. The density and temperature values for the Maxwellian case in Sect. 4.2 are
also shown for comparison. Right: 3D emissivity ratio for the κ = 2 case. We note that there is no crossing point in this case. Diﬀerent colours for

will be strongly enhanced compared to the O iv and S iv ones
(Dudík et al. 2014). This eﬀect could easily explain the large in-
tensities of the Si iv lines compared to the O iv ones reported in
Sect. 4, except for some of the spectra in the ﬂare case (although
see discussion in Sect.4.3).

However, unambiguous detection of such non-Maxwellian
distributions from IRIS observations is not trivial. This is due to
the fact that only a few lines are observed by IRIS, and that these
lines are formed from energy levels close in wavelength. There
are however indirect indications of the possible presence of non-
Maxwellian distributions in the present observations. First, as
already mentioned, the Si iv intensities are too large by a sig-
niﬁcant factor compared to the Maxwellian predictions at the
values of T and Ne derived from the ER method applied to the
AR loop in Sect. 4.2, leading to the densities diagnosed from
the ratio R4 being much higher than using other methods (see
Tab. 3 in Sect. 4.2). Second, the line proﬁles observed in the AR
(Sect. 4.2, Fig. 5), especially in the loop, show narrow cores and
broad wings, consistent with a velocity distribution for the ions
given by a κ-distribution (generalized Lorentzian). Preliminary
work on ﬁtting the line proﬁles using the method of Jeﬀrey et al.
(2016) suggests that at least some of the line proﬁles are well-
ﬁtted with a κ ≈ 2. Since a detailed analysis of multiple line pro-
ﬁles in diﬀerent observed regions is beyond the scope of the
present manuscript, in the following we only show the possible
eﬀect of the κ-distributions on the density diagnostics for the AR
loop presented in Sect. 4.2. This can be done by calculating the
contribution function Gth of the O iv and S iv lines assuming κ-
distributions for the electrons, analogous to Dudík et al. (2014),
but with the same atomic data as described in Sect. 2. Addition-
ally, we have corrected a minor error in the collision strengths
calculations performed by Dudík et al. (2014) as shown in Ap-
pendix C. The estimated values of temperature and density from
the ER method for diﬀerent κ values are shown in the left panel
of Fig. 14. The isothermal crossing points exist at for κ ≧ 3 if
temperatures of logT [K] ≧ 4 are considered. The isothermal and
iso-density crossing points occur at progressively lower T and
Ne (Fig. 14, Table 5). However, no crossing point exists for κ = 2
(right panel of Fig. 14), which is inconsistent with the line pro-

ﬁles, assuming that the electrons and ions have the same velocity
distribution. The cause of this is unknown at present.

Tab. 5 and Fig. 14 show that a range of possible values of
density and temperature diagnostics for the AR loop if non-
thermal distributions at diﬀerent κ values were present in the
observed plasma.

6. Discussion and Summary
In this work we have investigated the use of the O iv and S iv
emission lines near 1400 Å observed by IRIS as electron density
diagnostics in the plasma from which they are emitted. These
ions are formed at similar temperatures and therefore are ex-
pected to provide similar density diagnostics (within a factor of
around two).

Density diagnostics are usually based on the use of the in-
tensity ratio of two lines from the same ion. We have applied
an emissivity ratio method to obtain a value of electron density
which can reproduce the relative intensity of the all the O iv and
S iv lines in the observed spectra.

In our analysis, we have selected diﬀerent plasma regions
within an AR (loop, bright point and a plage region) and at the
ribbon of the 22 June 2015 ﬂare, where the lines were observed
to be more intense. The O iv and S iv lines (in particular the O iv
line at 1399.77 Å) are usually very weak and cannot easily be
detected in quiet Sun regions with IRIS.

In all the features we analysed, we ﬁnd that the O iv and S iv
lines give consistent density diagnostic results when we assume
that the plasma has a near isothermal distribution rather than dif-
ferent temperatures of formation for the two ions. In all cases,
the results are consistent with the plasma being at a temperature
of about logT [K]=5. This temperature is lower than the peak for-
mation temperature of O iv calculated in CHIANTI v.8 assuming
ionization equilibrium. However, a signiﬁcant amount of O iv is
still formed at a temperature of logT [K] ≈ 5.0, as shown in the
fractional abundance plot in Fig. 13 (continuous lines), and even
more so when the high density eﬀects are taken into account
(dotted lines). The hypothesis of iso-thermality for the O iv and
S iv plasma could be explained by the fact that all the features

we analysed are either cool loop structures or loop footpoints,
which are often observed to be dominated by plasma with a very
narrow thermal distribution (e.g. Del Zanna 2003; Warren et al.
2008; Schmelz et al. 2007, 2014). We also emphasize that we
are estimating average values of temperature and density for the
emitting plasma.

Using the emissivity ratio method, we ﬁnd electron num-
ber densities ranging from logNe [cm−3] ≈ 10.6–11.0 in the AR
loop and bright point respectively. The density variation in dif-
ferent plasma features in the AR under study can also qual-
itatively be estimated by comparing the spectra shown in the
right panel of Fig. 5. For instance, in the bright point spectrum
(red), formed in a higher density plasma, the intensity of the S iv
1406.1 Å spectral line is enhanced compared to the intensity of
O iv+S iv blend at 1404.82 Å. In contrast, in the loop spectrum
the S iv 1406.16 Å line is weaker, indicating that the plasma is at
a lower density. In addition, we note that the densities obtained
by using the Si iv/O iv line ratio R4 are much higher than the val-
ues obtained by using the O iv R1 and S iv R3 ratios, as shown
in Tab. 3 and previously noted by Hayes & Shine (1987). This
could be due to a number of issues, as outlined in Sect. 1 and
5.2, and in particular to the anomalous behaviour of the Na-like
ions.

In the ﬂare case presented in Sect. 4.2, the O iv line ratio
indicates a very high electron number density above the high
density limit of ≈ 1012 cm−3. The S iv line ratio is sensitive to
higher electron densities and has been used to measure densities
of ≈ 1013 cm−3 at the TR footpoints of the ﬂare during the im-
pulsive phase. Indications of high electron densities in the TR
plasma during ﬂares have been reported by some authors in the
past. In particular, Keenan et al. (1995) obtained 1012 cm−3 using
the O v line ratio, while Cook et al. (1994) reported density val-
ues of 1012.6 cm−3 using ratios of allowed and intersystem O iv
lines. However, most of the other studies (e.g., Cook et al. 1995)
were based on the use of line ratios, such the O iv ones used in
this work, which are density-sensitive up to a high density limit
of 1012 cm−3, and therefore could only provide lower estimates
for the electron density. Other authors have investigated electron
number densities in high temperature plasma during ﬂares. For
instance, Doschek et al. (1981) measured densities of 1012 cm−3
in the O vii coronal plasma at 2 MK. Of particular importance is
the study of Phillips et al. (1996), who showed for the ﬁrst time
very high electron densities (up to 1013 cm−3) from ions formed
at ≈ 10 MK. Those high densities were observed 1 minute after
the peak of a M-class ﬂare. By using the ratio of the S iv lines
observed by IRIS, we obtain an accurate electron density esti-
mates for the TR plasma which are almost everywhere within the
sensitivity range of the line ratio. Fig. 10 shows that very high
densities close to or above 1013 cm−3 are only reached over a
short period of time during the peak of the ﬂare, before dropping
dramatically by more than an order of magnitude at the same
footpoint position over 2 minutes. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst time we can directly diagnose such high electron
number densities in the TR plasma during a ﬂare. Density diag-
nostics based on the use of S iv line ratios with previous instru-
ments in the past were complicated by the presence of line blends
which could not be properly resolved and problems in the atomic
data (Dufton et al. 1982a; Cook et al. 1995), as also pointed out
by Keenan et al. (2002b). In this work we have shown that the
S iv 1404.85 Å line can be accurately de-blended from the O iv
1404.85 Å line in the high density interval above 1012 cm−3. In
this case in fact the ratio R2 remains constant, reducing the uncer-
tainty associated with the estimation of the O iv 1404.85 Å con-

tribution to blend by using the O iv 1401.16 Å line intensity (see
middle panel of Fig. 2). One might think that at such high val-
ues of densities, the opacity eﬀects may become important. This
is not the case for the O iv and S iv intercombination lines, due
to the low A-values of these transitions. The optical depth can
in fact be easily estimated by using the classical formula given
for instance in Buchlin & Vial (2009). We found that at a den-
sity of ≈ 1013 cm−3, the O iv lines reach an opacity of 1 over an
emitting layer of the order of 105 km, which is much higher than
the source size (≈ size of the IRIS pixel, i.e. around 200 km).
In contrast, the Si iv reaches an opacity of 1 over a considerably
smaller layer, of the order of ≈ 20 km. This implies that opacity
eﬀects might be important for this line in the ﬂare case study.
In particular, a decrease in the Si iv intensity due to the opacity
might result in wrong density estimates based on the Si iv/O iv
ratio.

Moreover, we emphasize the importance of including the ef-
fect of high electron number densities (above 1010 cm−3) in the
calculations of the fractional ion abundances. In Sect. 5.1 we
show that including fractional ion abundances for O iv and S iv
calculated at higher electron number density does not signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀect the results of the density diagnostics from the emis-
sivity ratio method. In contrast, the temperature formation of the
ions, and therefore the temperature estimation from the emissiv-
ity ratio method, is shifted to lower values, as shown in Fig. 13.
Similarly, the presence of non-Maxwellian electron dis-
tribution in the plasma causes a shift of the temperature of
formation of the ions to lower values. It is not possible to unam-
biguously detect signatures of non-thermal plasma conditions
in the present study. A possible signature might arise from the
analysis of the spectral line proﬁles. These proﬁles provide
information regarding the velocity distribution of the ions, and
it is reasonable to assume that this distribution is the same than
the electron velocity distribution at these plasma densities and at
the timescale of our observations. However, this analysis is quite
involved and requires further investigation which is beyond the
scope of this paper. In this work, we are interested in estimating
how the possible presence of non-thermal electron distributions
might aﬀect our density diagnostics. We therefore provide a
range of possible values of density and temperature diagnostics
for the AR loop obtained by using the emissivity ratio method,
assuming that κ-distributions at diﬀerent κ values were present.
The results are presented in Fig. 14 and Tab. 5, showing that
the density and temperature diagnostics would indeed diﬀer
signiﬁcantly from the values obtained in Sect. 4.2, where we
assumed Maxwellian electron distributions.

We have shown that combining O iv and S iv observations
from the recent IRIS satellite provide a useful tool to measure
the electron number density in a variety of plasma environments.
In particular, thanks to very high spatial resolution of IRIS (≈
200 km) it is now possible to select small spatial elements,
reducing the problem of observing emission from very diﬀerent
density and temperature plasma regions, as pointed out in the
past by e.g., Doschek (1984).

In this work, we greatly emphasized the importance of in-
cluding the S iv lines in the IRIS observational studies. Si-
multaneous, high-cadence observations of several spectral lines
formed in the transition region can be used as direct density and
temperature diagnostics of the emitting plasma. These diagnos-
tics provide crucial information which can be compared with the
predictions made by theoretical models of energetic events in the
solar atmosphere.

Appendix A: Atomic data and wavelengths

AppendixA.1: S iv

In this section we discuss in detail the atomic data used for S iv.
Large discrepancies between the densities obtained from the
O iv and S iv lines have been noted by several authors. For exam-
ple, Cook et al. (1995) presented solar and stellar observations
obtained with the HRTS, the SO82B spectrograph on board Sky-
lab and the GHRS on board the HST. The O iv intensities were in
the high-density limit during solar ﬂares, and the S iv ratios were
inconsistent with the available atomic data. Cook et al. (1995)
used the Dufton et al. (1982b) scattering calculations for S iv.
The main problem turned out to be that these atomic data for S iv
were incorrect. Tayal (2000) carried out a new R-matrix scatter-
ing calculation that included 52 ﬁne-structure levels. The new
atomic data resolved the main discrepancies at low densities, as
shown e.g. by Keenan et al. (2002b) using RR Tel HST STIS
observations.

However, the high-density solar and stellar observations as
reviewed by Del Zanna et al. (2002) still indicated a small dis-
crepancy in the 1404.8 Å blend. Assuming that the O iv and
S iv lines were formed at the temperatures near peak abun-
dance in equilibrium, the densities obtained from all the O iv and
S iv lines were consistent, with the exception of the 1404.8 Å
line, which was about 30% stronger than predicted.

the wavelengths for

These discrepancies prompted a new much larger R-
matrix scattering calculation by the UK APAP network2 and
a revision of
this ion, presented in
Del Zanna & Badnell (2016). We use this new atomic data here.
Problems were found in some of the atomic data calculated by
Tayal (2000). However, they did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the in-
tensities of the intercombination lines, even though 715 ﬁne-
structure levels were included in the calculation. As shown in
Del Zanna & Badnell (2016), the main excitation rates that drive
the level population of the 3s 3p2 4P levels are very close (to
within a few percent) to those calculated by Tayal (2000).

A Table of A-values calculated by various authors was also
provided in Del Zanna & Badnell (2016). The calculated A-
values for the main transitions were within a few percent of
the intensities of the most accurate previous calculations, by
Hibbert et al. (2002). The largest diﬀerence (about 10%) was
found for the 1404.8 Å transition. We therefore estimate an un-
certainty for the ratios of the S iv intercombination lines of about
10%.

Proton excitation among the O iv 2s2 2p 2P and 2s 2p2 4P
levels is known to have a small eﬀect on the population of these
levels, so we explored whether proton excitation could also aﬀect
the S iv levels. The CHIANTI model only includes proton rates
for the 3s2 3p 2P ground term, however we found estimates of
the proton rates to the 3s 3p2 4P levels obtained by Bhatia et al.
(1980b). These rates are probably accurate to within a 50%. We
found no signiﬁcant eﬀects due to the inclusion of these proton
rates within the error limits.

An entire Appendix in Del Zanna & Badnell (2016) is dedi-
cated to a reassessment of the energies of the levels for S iv, and
a revision of the rest wavelengths of the lines, for which a large
scatter exists in the literature. Of the main four intercombination
lines, IRIS only observes two, the 2P3/2 - 4P5/2 at 1406.06 Å,
and the 2P1/2 - 4P1/2 at 1404.85 Å. It is not trivial to measure
the rest wavelengths of these lines, because their proﬁles are of-
ten asymmetric and mostly redshifted in the solar atmosphere.

Del Zanna & Badnell (2016) adopted the wavelengths from Sky-
lab observations at the limb, as reported by Sandlin et al. (1986).
Their accuracy is about 0.005 Å. The ﬁrst line was directly ob-
served at 1406.059±0.005 Å. The wavelength of the second line
was obtained from the 1423.885±0.005 Å decay to the 3s2 3p
2P3/2, measured by Sandlin et al. (1986), and a ground level 3s2
3p 2P separation of 951.4 Kaysers, from measurements of the
forbidden line in planetary nebulae, see e.g. Feuchtgruber et al.
(1997). Finally, we note that the NIST database gives wave-
lengths of 1406.009 and 1404.808 Å, i.e. for the blended line
gives the same wavelength as the O iv line (see below).

AppendixA.2: O iv

In this section we discuss the atomic data used for O iv.

Diagnostic lines from O iv ions have been used for a
long time to measure electron number densities (see, e.g.
Flower & Nussbaumer (1975); Feldman & Doschek (1979b)),
and many atomic calculations have been produced over the
years. The most recent scattering calculations (for all the B-like
ions) are those of the UK APAP network (Liang et al. 2012),
which have been corrected for an error and distributed within
the CHIANTI v.8 database (Del Zanna et al. 2015). We use
these data here. Liang et al. (2012) performed R-matrix calcula-
tions for electron-impact excitation amongst 204 close-coupling
levels (up to n = 4). The excitation rates in previous CHI-
ANTI versions (until 7.1) were from the R-matrix calculations
of Blum & Pradhan (1992), as reported by Zhang et al. (1994).
They included only the lowest 15 (n = 2) close-coupling levels.
Unpublished calculations for n = 3 levels were added. Version
7.1 included new excitation rates calculated with the relativis-
tic DARC R-matrix code by Aggarwal & Keenan (2008). These
close-coupling calculations included the energetically lowest 75
levels (n = 2, 3). The excitation rates to the 2s 2p2 4P lev-
els as calculated by Aggarwal & Keenan (2008) and Liang et al.
(2012) are quite similar, within a few percent.

For the A-values, CHIANTI v.8 selected those for the lower
levels calculated by Corrégé & Hibbert (2004) with the CIV3
code (Hibbert 1975) and for the higher levels those calculated
by Rynkun et al. (2012b) with the multi-conﬁguration Dirac-
Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) GRASP2K code (Jönsson et al. 2007).
Earlier, Tachiev & Froese Fischer (2000) carried out Breit-Pauli
multiconﬁguration Hartree-Fock calculations for the B-like ions.
All these A-values are shown in Table A, together with those
of Liang et al. (2012). Clearly, there is excellent agreement to
well within 10% among the calculations, with the exception of
Liang et al. (2012). This is because the latter obtained the best
target for the scattering calculations, and did not optimise the
calculation for the radiative data. We can therefore reasonably
assume an overall uncertainty of about 10% in the intensity ra-
tios of the intercombination lines, as in the S iv case.

As in the S iv case, several wavelength measurements can be
found in the literature. Earlier version of the CHIANTI database
had wavelengths for these lines which were close to those ob-
tained from the level energies recommended by Edlén (1983).
We report these wavelengths in Table A.2. In turn, these values
are minor revisions of an earlier work (Edlén 1981), which was
mainly based on the experimental observations of Bromander
(1969), who used a very large (3m focal length) spectrograph
and measured the wavelengths to better than 0.01 Å. Since then,
better solar rest wavelengths were obtained by Sandlin et al.
(1986) from Skylab observations at the limb, with an accuracy
of about 0.005 Å.

Notes. Wavelengths are in vacuum. B69: Bromander (1969); E83: Edlén (1983); S86: Sandlin et al. (1986); Y11: Young et al. (2011) and CHI-
ANTI v.7.1; V.8: CHIANTI v.8 (Del Zanna et al. 2015). Values in brackets indicate the uncertainties in the measured wavelengths.

The CHIANTI wavelengths were revised in version
to include the values obtained by
7.1 (Landi et al. 2013),
Young et al. (2011) using HST/STIS RR Tel spectra. This revi-
sion caused some confusion in the literature, especially regard-
ing the wavelength of the line blended with S iv, estimated by
Young et al. (2011) at 1404.779 Å. However, it turns out that
these revised wavelengths are not consistent with the Bromander
(1969) and the Sandlin et al. (1986) ones, which had better accu-
racy and were very close. Therefore, a new set of wavelengths,
consistent with these two sets of experimental data, have been
introduced in CHIANTI v.8 (Del Zanna et al. 2015). The esti-
mated wavelength of the 2P3/2 - 4P3/2 line is 1404.806 Å, i.e.
very close to the estimated wavelength for the S iv transition,
1404.85 Å. The high-resolution IRIS spectra support these esti-
mates. Indeed, if the two lines were further apart in wavelength,
the IRIS spectra would show a broadened proﬁle, which is not
observed.

Appendix B: Observation of the TR spectra in the

AR 12356

In this section, we provide some additional details for the anal-
ysis of the AR plage and bright point spectra shown in Fig. 4,
similarly to that presented in Sect. 4.2 for the loop case. Fig.
B.1 shows the individual TR spectra for the AR plage, loop and
bright point regions including the double Gaussian ﬁtting. In all
cases, the double ﬁt reproduces well the proﬁle of the O iv and
S iv lines but not of the Si iv 1402.77 Å line. In Tab. B.1 and
B.2 we compare the intensities obtained by using the double ﬁt-
ting (ﬁt) and summing the total counts (sum) for each line under
study in the plage and bright point case respectively, as discussed

in Sect. 4.1. The results of the ER method are shown in Fig. B.2
and B.3 for AR plage, and in Fig. B.4 and B.5 for the bright
point, similar to Sect. 4.2. The corresponding density and tem-
perature values estimated are reported in Tab. 3 in the text. From
Fig. B.2 and B.4 and Tab. 3 we note that assuming the peak for-
mation temperature for each ion (top panels of Fig. B.2 and B.4)
results in electron number densities which are similar to those
obtained applying the ER method (bottom panels of Fig. B.2 and
B.4). However, in the ﬁrst case, there is still a large discrepancy
between the relative intensity of the S iv and O iv lines, as was
also observed for the loop and ﬂare cases in Sect. 4.2 and 4.3.
This discrepancy seems to be resolved if we assume the same
temperature for the O iv and S iv plasma, as described in the text.

component from the ﬁt, while the continuous blue line is the sum of these components. We note that the Si iv line at 1402.77 Å is not properly
ﬁtted by two ﬁt components alone. The red vertical dotted lines represent the wavelength interval over which we integrated the total counts for
each line.

Appendix C: Correction in non-Maxwellian collision

strengths calculations

In this section we provide the corrections to the collision
strengths calculations performed by Dudík et al. (2014). Al-
though the error in the collision strengths for the IRIS lines is
only a few per cent, the level population can be signiﬁcantly af-
fected for high densities and low κ → 2, aﬀecting the behaviour
of the theoretical O iv density-sensitive ratios R1–R3. Revised
density-sensitive ratios are shown in Fig. C.1 in Appendix C.
For κ = 2, the ratios are shifted to lower densities by about 0.3
dex compared to the Maxwellian ones.
