We investigate the integrability properties and existence of analytic solutions in

f (R)-cosmology by using the singularity analysis. Speciﬁcally, for some power-law

f (R)-theories of special interest we apply the ARS algorithm to prove if the ﬁeld

equations possess the Painlev´e property. Constraints for the free parameters of the

power-law models are constructed and new analytic solutions are derived which are

expressed in terms of Laurent expansions.

INTRODUCTION

The determination of exact and analytic solutions for the description of dynamical sys-

tems is an essential procedure for the analysis of a given dynamical system in all areas of

physics and applied mathematics. Nowadays, numerical techniques are applied widely for

the analysis of dynamical systems. However, the derivation of exact and analytic solutions

for a set of diﬀerential equations gives an elegant way for the analysis of the dynamical

system. Arscott expressed in a very nice way in the preface of his book [1] the necessity

for the search of analytic solutions and do not rely on numerical methods; Arscott wrote:

“[...] fall back on numerical techniques savours somewhat of breaking a door with a hammer

when one could, with a little trouble, ﬁnd the key”.

Einstein’s General Relativity provides a set of nonlinear diﬀerential equations, known

as Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, which relates the physical space and the matter source.

In

cosmological studies, the ﬁeld equations are reduced to a system of nonlinear ordinary dif-

ferential equations that still in the case of vacuum can be solved easily. Some cosmological

solutions describing vacuum geometries are presented in [2–5]. In the simplest cosmological

scenario, for which the physical space is described by the spatially ﬂat Friedmann–Lemaˆıtre–

Robertson–Walker (FLRW) geometry, with or without the cosmological constant term, the

nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations can be linearised under the application of a point

transformation [6]. The linearisation of these ﬁeld equations is ensured by the existence of

the maximum number of point transformations under which the ﬁeld equations are invari-

ant. The symmetry analysis is a systematic way for the determination of invariant functions

for dynamical system which has been widely applied in gravitational physics and cosmology

[7–11]. Furthermore, the symmetry analysis is the main approach for the investigation of

the integrability properties and the construction of analytic solutions for the ﬁeld equations

in modiﬁed and extended theories of gravity, see for instance [12–16] and references cited

therein.

Another systematic approach for the construction of analytic solutions which has been

applied in gravitational physics is the singularity analysis or as also known the Painlev´e anal-

ysis. The singularity analysis of diﬀerential equations is a major tool in the determination of

the integrability of diﬀerential equations. These days, singularity analysis is associated with

the French school led by Painlev´e in the previous century [17–20], which followed the appli-

cation to the determination of the third integrable case of Euler’s equations for a spinning

top by Kowalevskaya [21]. For an extended mathematical discussion of the Painlev´e analysis

we refer the reader to [22]. The singularity analysis has been the main mathematical tool

for the debate of the integrability properties for the Mixmaster Universe (Bianchi IX), see

the discussion in [23–26]. However, it has been widely applied and in other gravitational

models see for instance [27–33].

In this work we are interested in the application of singularity analysis for the construction

of new analytic solutions in f (R)-gravity [34] within the cosmological scenario of a spatially

3

ﬂat FLRW universe. f (R)-gravity is a fourth-order theory of gravity in which the Einstein-

Hilbert Action is modiﬁed such that the Action Integral be a function f for the Ricci scalar

R [36, 37]. The main idea behind the modiﬁcation of the gravitational Action Integral

is that the new degrees of freedom introduced by the modiﬁcation drive the cosmological

dynamics so as to explain the cosmological observations [35]. The quadratic theory of

gravity [38–40] f (R) = R + qR2, known also as the Starobinsky model of inﬂation [41], is

one of the most known f (R) models. This speciﬁc theory ﬁts the cosmological observations

and provides a theoretical mechanism to explain the inﬂationary parameters [42]. The

integrability properties of this speciﬁc theory were found recently with the application of

the singularity analysis in [43], while with the same approach the analytic solution for the

power-law theory f (R) = R + qRn was determined in [44]. In the following we consider

other models of f (R) theory and we seek if the ﬁeld equations possess the Painlev´e property

and the cosmological solution can be written in terms of Laurent expansions. Such analysis

provide us with important information about the f (R)-cosmology and the general behaviour

of the dynamics. The plan of the paper is as follows.

In Section 2 we present the ﬁeld equations in the context of f (R)-cosmology. The main

properties and deﬁnitions for the singularity analysis are given in Section 3. The new results

of this study are presented in Section 4, where we present new analytic solutions in f (R)-

theory for speciﬁc functional forms of the f (R) function. Finally, in Section 5 we draw our

conclusions.

where R is the Ricci scalar for the background geometry with metric gµν, g is the determinant

of the metric tensor, Lm is the Lagrangian function for the matter source and k

8πG.

≡

Because the Ricci scalar includes second-order derivatives for a nonlinear function f , it is

easy to infer that the ﬁeld equations which follow from (1) are of fourth-order. In additional,
for a linear function f , that is f ′′ = 0; f ′ = df

dR , the Einstein-Hilbert Action is recovered and

the gravitational theory is reduced to General Relativity.

Variation of the Action Integral (1) with respect to the metric tensor produces the grav-

important to mention that now all equations are independent.

There is a plethora of functional forms of the f (R) which have been proposed in the

literature. Some of these models are presented in Table I.

3. SINGULARITY ANALYSIS

The modern treatment of the singularity analysis is summarized in an algorithm proposed

by Ablowitz, Ramani and Segur, known as the ARS algorithm [51–53]. In the following lines

we present the three basic steps of the ARS algorithm for ordinary diﬀerential equations.

For a pedagogical review we refer the reader to [54].

We assume now an ordinary diﬀerential equation

(t, x (t) , ˙x (t) , ¨x (t) , ...)

0 where t

≡

F

is the independent variable and x (t) is the dependent variable. The ﬁrst step of the ARS

algorithm is to determine whether a moveable singularity exists. For that we assume that

near to the singularity the solution of the diﬀerential equation is asymptotically described

by the function

x (t) = x0 (t

t0)p ,

−

6

(12)

where t0 marks the position of the singularity. Hence by substituting this functional form

into the diﬀerential equation from the dominant power terms we derive the two variables , p

and x0. For the exponent p it should be negative number in order for the singularity to be

a pole. However, this has since been relaxed to include fractional exponents, even positive

ones as the derivative of a positive fractional exponent eventually gives a negative exponent

and so a singularity.

The second step of the ARS algorithm is related with the study of the existence of conser-

vation laws; that is, of the integration constants. A dth-order ordinary diﬀerential equation

requires d integration constants, while one of the integration constants is the position of

the movable singularity, that is, the parameter t0, we should prove the existence of d

integration constants. To do so, we substitute

x (t) = a(t

t0)p + m(t

t0)p+s

−

−

1

−

(13)

into the dominant terms of the equation and collect the terms linear in m where the co-

eﬃcient ﬁrstly enters the expansion. When the multiplier of m is zero, the value of m is

arbitrary. The latter requirement provides a polynomial equation in terms of s. The zeros

of the polynomial gives the values of the resonances s. One of these must be

1 which

−

is associated with the integration constant t0, while the remaining s should be rational

numbers.

The third step of the algorithm is known as the consistency test. Speciﬁcally we substitute

an appropriate Laurent series into the full ordinary diﬀerential equation to ensure that there

is consistency with the type of Series which the analysis of the dominant terms implies.

Which means that we validate the existence of the solution.

When a given diﬀerential equation passes the ARS algorithm the we say that it possess

the Painlev´e property and is conjectured to be integrable. The analytic solution is expressed

in terms of a Laurent expansion.

In order to demonstrate the application of the ARS algorithm to ordinary diﬀerential

equations we consider the Painleve-Ince Equation [55]

¨x + 3x ˙x + x3 = 0.

(14)

7

For the ﬁrst step of the ARS algorithm we substitute expression (12) into the diﬀerential

equation to obtain

x0p (p

1) (t

−

t0)p−2 + 3x0 (t

t0)2p−1 + x3

0 (t

t0)3p = 0,

−

−

from which it follows that the singular behaviour is for p =

1, and x0 = 1 or x0 = 2.

−

We proceed with the second step of the algorithm. We replace expression (13) into the

Painleve-Ince Equation and we linearise around m. Thus the coeﬃcient of m provides the

polynomial

where P (s; 1) = 0 gives s =

−

P (s; x0) = s2 + 3s (x0 −

1) + 3x0 (x0 −
1, s = 1 and P (s, 2) gives s =

2) + 2,

(15)

1 and s =

−

2. The latter

−

means that there are two Laurent expansions that may solve the Painleve-Ince Equation.

Assume now the case for x0 = 1, then we consider the Laurent expansion

x (t) = (t

−

t0)−1 + x1 (t

t0)0 + x2 (t

t0)1 + x3 (t

t0)2 ... ,

−

we replace in the original equation and we ﬁnd that it is a solution for x1 arbitrary, which

is the second integration constant of the problem, and x2 =

1 , x3 = x3
x2

1 etc.

−

We now proceed with the application of the singularity analysis in f (R)-cosmology.

4. ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS

In order to apply the singularity analysis we substitute (6) into (7). Thus we obtain

a second-order equation for the Hubble function H (t). In the following we consider some

power-law f (R) models.

4.1. Model f (R) = Rκ

As a toy model we assume the power-law model f (R) = Rκ, κ

= 0, 1. Thus, equation

(7) is

κ (κ

1) H ¨H + (κ

−

1) ˙H 2 + (κ (7

4κ)

−

−

4) H 2 ˙H + (2 (κ

−

2)) H 4 = 0.

(16)

We follow the ARS algorithm as described in the previous section. We ﬁnd that the

leading-order behaviour is

where without loss of generality we assume that the singularity is at t0 = 0.

Hence, the leading-order behaviour corresponds to the power-law scale factor a0 = tH0,

which describes ideal gas solution with equation of state parameter wef f (H0) = 2

We continue with the second step of the ARS algorithm, the resonances are

which describe the analytic solution. Indeed, for s2 ≥

arbitrary. Thus, the singularity analysis fails for κ

= 5
4.

We proceed with the ﬁnal step of the ARS algorithm, the consistency test, by selecting

speciﬁc values for the free parameter κ.

Assume now that κ = 1

2, then, for the leading-order behaviour with H0 = 1

2, we ﬁnd the

resonances sA

2 = 3. We write the Laurent expansion

H (t) =

t−1 + H1 + H2t + H3t2 + H4t3 + ...

(20)

and, by replacing in (16), it follows that H1 = 0, H2 = 0, H4 = 0, H5 = 0, H6 = 22

7 H 2

which H3 is the second integration constant.

Assume now the cosmological model with κ = 3

For the case with H0 = 2, we write the Left expansion

(21)

where it follows that H−1

is arbitrary and H−2 = 1

4 (H−1)3, etc.

We summarize the results in the following proposition.

Proposition 1: For the f (R) = Rκ, κ

= 0, 1, the cosmological ﬁeld equations possess

the Painlev´e property for κ

= 5

4, thus the ﬁeld equations are integrable.

Of course the model f (R) = Rκ is a very simple cosmological scenario where according

to the analysis presented in [57] it is not cosmological viable.

In addition from previous

analysis we know that this power-law model gives an integrable set of cosmological ﬁeld

equations with conservation laws provided by the symmetry analysis.

4.2. Model f (R) = R + qRκ

2Λ

−

We now proceed with the second model of our analysis, the f (R) = R+qRκ

2Λ, κ

= 0, 1.

−

For Λ = 0, the singularity analysis for this model has been applied in [44]. There it was

found that the cosmological ﬁeld equations possess the Painlev´e property for κ > 2. The

analysis has been performed for the system of second-order equations (6) and (8) for the

variables (a, R). In this attempt we proceed with the analysis for the second-order ordinary

diﬀerential equation (7) for the variable H, where we asssume Λ

= 0.

Thus, for this speciﬁc f (R) model, the master equation for the Hubble function reads

Hence, by replacing H (t) = H0tp, we ﬁnd that the dominant terms are these provided

by the Rκ component for κ > 2, and p =

2 or H0 = (κ−1)(2κ−1)

2−κ

−

step of the ARS algorithm we ﬁnd that the resonances are those given in expressions (18)

and (19) respectively.

For the consistency test, we assume the case κ = 3, for which the resonances are s1 =

1
−

and s2 = 35. We write the Laurent expansion

H (t) =

10t−1 + H1t0 + H2t1 + H3t2 + ...

−

,

(23)

which corresponds to the leading-order behaviour for the solution with H0 = (κ−1)(2κ−1)

2−κ

.

Then by replacing in (22) we ﬁnd that satisﬁes the consistency test with nonzero coeﬀcients

the H4, H6, H8 etc and second integration constant the H35.

and the only nonzero coeﬃcient is H9 =

Proposition 2: For the f (R) = R + qRκ

2Λ, κ

= 0, 1, the cosmological ﬁeld equations

possess the Painlev´e property for κ > 2. Thus the ﬁeld equations are integrable.

4.3. Model f (R) = R + qRκ + βR2

2Λ

−

we now assume the power-law extension for the quadratic inﬂationary model with

f (R) = R + qRκ + βR2

−

2Λ. We apply the ARS algorithm as before and we ﬁnd that the

ﬁeld equations possess the Painleve property for κ > 2, with leading-order behaviour and

resonances as given by (18) and (19). That means that the singularity is described by the

dominant terms given by the Rκ.

We now present consider the case κ = 3 and substitute the two Laurent expansions (23),

(24) into the master equation for the Hubble function.

It follows that the Laurent expansion (23) solves the master equation (7) with arbitrary

coeﬃcient being H35, and

H1 = 0, H2 =

5. CONCLUSIONS

The singularity analysis is a systematic way for the investigation of the integrability

properties of dynamical systems and the construction of analytic solutions. The singularity

analysis should be seen as complementary rather than competitive method of the symmetry

analysis for the study of dynamical systems. These two approaches are powerful tools for the

study of integrability. In terms of the modiﬁed theories of gravity, the symmetry analysis

has been used in order to constrain the unknown functions and parameters of the theory. For

instance, in f (R)-gravity, the symmetry analysis provides constraints for the functional form

of the f (R) function. However, this important property is partially true for the singularity

analysis. As we show from our analysis, only the free parameters of a speciﬁc f (R) function

were constrained by the requirement of the ARS algorithm.

In this study, we applied the singularity analysis in four power-law f (R) models which

have been proposed before in the literature. We considered the power-law f (R) = Rκ theory

6
12

as a toy model of study. It is well-known that f (R) = Rκ cosmology is an integrable model.

However, we proved that the ﬁeld equations possess the Painlev´e property. Speciﬁcally,

there are two possible Laurent expansions which describe the analytic solutions where the

dominant terms near to the singularity describes a radiation dominated universe or an ideal

gas dominated universe with equation of state parameter depending upon the parameter κ.

The results for the f (R) = Rκ model were used as the basis for the analysis of the rest of

the power-law models.

We considered the following models, f (R) = R + qRκ

and f (R) = (R

−

Hubble function possess the Painlev´e property for speciﬁc values of κ, with dominant terms

that of f (R) = Rκ and the analytic solutions can be expressed by left or right Laurent

expansions. Finally, we calculated the analytic solution for the ﬁeld equations for speciﬁc

values of κ.

From the above results we can make the conjecture that for every f (R) model, where

near to the movable singular behaviour, the f (R) function is dominated by the Rκ term,

the ﬁeld equations possess the Painlev´e property for speciﬁc values of κ, with leading-order

behaviour the radiation solution and/or the ideal gas solution.

In a future work we plan to extend this speciﬁc analysis for the study of other higher-order

gravitational theories.
