Abstract We explore the association of non-neutralized currents with solar ﬂare
occurrence in a sizable sample of observations, aiming to show the potential of
such currents in solar ﬂare prediction. We use the regularly produced high quality
vector magnetograms by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and more speciﬁcally
the Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP). Through a newly
established method, that incorporates detailed error analysis, we calculate the
non-neutralized currents contained in active regions (AR). Two predictors are
produced, namely the total and the maximum unsigned non-neutralized current.
Both are tested in AR time-series and a representative sample of point-in-time
observations during the interval 2012-2016. The average values of non-neutralized
currents in ﬂaring active regions are by more than an order of magnitude higher
than in non-ﬂaring regions and correlate very well with the corresponding ﬂare
index. The temporal evolution of these parameters appears to be connected
to physical processes, such as ﬂux emergence and/or magnetic polarity inver-
sion line formation that are associated with increased solar ﬂare activity. Using
Bayesian inference of ﬂaring probabilities, it is shown that the total unsigned
non-neutralized current outperforms signiﬁcantly the total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux and other well established current-related predictors. Thus, it shows good
prospects for inclusion in an operational ﬂare forecasting service. We plan to
use the new predictor in the framework of the FLARECAST project along with
other highly performing predictors.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares are localized and intense brightenings of the solar atmosphere, much
brighter than the background and evident throughout the entire electromagnetic
spectrum. They are associated with in situ acceleration of energetic particles and
(often) coronal mass ejections (CMEs), comprising some of the most spectacular
and energetic phenomena of the solar system (Fletcher et al., 2011). The overall
associated energy, released in very short time, is even exceeding 1032 erg in very
large events encompassing both thermal and non-thermal processes.

The soft X-ray ﬂux of a ﬂare in the 1-8 ˚A range, as recorded by the Geo-
stationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), is used to categorize
solar ﬂares in order from largest to smallest in a logarithmic scale of classes
X, M, C, B and A. These scales are complemented by decimal subclasses (e.g.
M1.0, C5.2, etc). Flares of M1.0 and higher are often referred to as major ﬂares
and are the ones that mostly aﬀect the geospatial environment. On the other
hand, B- and A-class ﬂares are the weakest and often lie within the soft X-ray
background produced by the global solar atmosphere.

Flares and CMEs aﬀect the geospatial environment in diverse ways, at timescales

ranging from a few minutes to days. In ﬂares, these eﬀects are immediate. The
electron density in a range of ionospheric altitudes is aﬀected by the enhanced
X-ray and EUV radiation, disrupting radio communications while the subse-
quent expansion of the atmosphere increases the drag on low-altitude satellites.
Space-born instrumentation and crew are also vulnerable to direct ﬂare-related
electromagnetic radiation and particles. This evident absence of early warning
for ﬂares and ﬂare-related eﬀects has necessitated the pursuit for accurate ﬂare
prediction. The scientiﬁc community has intensiﬁed eﬀorts in this direction by
incorporating the constant ﬂow of solar magnetic observations achieved during
the last decades. This is done towards two complementary and often overlapping
directions: on one hand, to understand the fundamental physics behind the ﬂare
phenomenon (Shibata and Magara, 2011). On the other hand, to develop eﬃcient
ﬂare prediction schemes (see e.g. Georgoulis, 2012b).

Energy released in ﬂares is known to be stored in the intense, complex mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁgurations of solar active regions. The ability of magnetic ﬁelds
to store energy is associated with their departure from a current-free (potential)
state. This non-potentiality is evident in optical (Hα, Hβ), EUV and X-ray
images of the active region solar corona, where signiﬁcant twist of the coronal
loops is seen (Leka et al., 1996; Schrijver, 2016). This twist requires the presence
of substantial amounts of ﬁeld–aligned electric currents. Therefore, the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration and the electric current distribution oﬀer two aspects of the
same physical reality (see e.g. Melrose, 1995, and references therein). Since infer-
ring the electric currents requires the ability to record all three components of the
magnetic ﬁeld vector, studies focusing on electric currents and their role in ﬂares
started after vector magnetograms became widely available (see e.g. Canﬁeld
et al., 1993; Zhang, 1995; Leka et al., 1996, and references therein). Nowadays,
the regular ﬂow of high temporal and spatial resolution photospheric vector
magnetograms has boosted research in this topic (e.g. Ravindra et al., 2011;

Non-neutralized currents and ﬂare productivity

Gosain, D´emoulin, and L´opez Fuentes, 2014; Janvier et al., 2014; Vemareddy,
Venkatakrishnan, and Karthikreddy, 2015; Inoue et al., 2015).

A pertinent issue is whether electric currents in solar active regions are neu-
tralized. In the ideal case of an isolated twisted ﬂux tube embedded in a ﬁeld-free
medium, the net current along the tube should be zero, being equal to the sum
of two opposite directed currents: a direct (volume) current along its axis that
produces its twist and a return (surface) current that isolates the ﬂux tubes from
the ﬁeld-free environment (Parker, 1979). Current neutralization subsequently
means that direct and return currents balance each other within a given mag-
netic polarity of an active region, giving rise to a zero net current per polarity.
However, early calculations based on vector magnetograms showed that high
values of net currents exist within active regions, implying a non-neutralization
situation and a subsequent injection of net currents in the solar corona (Melrose,
1991, 1995).

Since then, a series of studies addressed the non-neutralization of photospheric
electric currents and their origin. Most of them have shown that there are weak or
no return currents in the photosphere (Leka et al., 1996; McClymont, Jiao, and
Mikic, 1997; Semel and Skumanich, 1998; Wheatland, 2000; Falconer, 2001) and
it is now being largely accepted that the currents that run along the magnetic
ﬁeld lines are non-neutralized. However, there have been some opposing argu-
ments, reporting the existence of return currents in isolated sunspots (Wilkinson,
Emslie, and Gary, 1992). Also, according to Parker (1996), the observational
limitations of magnetographs consequently lead to erroneous calculations of
net electric currents with no physical meaning, when the diﬀerential form of
Amp´ere’s law is used.

To address the issues of spatial resolution and errors that may hinder the
correct interpretation Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c (2012), proposed a detailed
methodology for the calculation of electric current neutralization. They also
incorporated a detailed error analysis and imposed strict criteria on current neu-
tralization. Their study of two active regions showed that intense non-neutralized
currents are found exclusively at the vicinity of strong magnetic polarity inver-
sion lines (MPIL) and that higher values are linked with higher ﬂare productivity.
Strong MPILs separate opposite polarities and are characterized by high mag-
netic ﬁeld strength, leading to a plasma β of order unity at the photosphere.
In such conditions, the Lorentz force can overcome the hydrodynamic inertia of
the photospheric plasma and produce shear. It was, therefore, concluded that
non-neutralized currents are injected in the atmosphere with the emergence of
ﬂux and the shear observed in MPILs is generated by the Lorentz force when
the cylindrical symmetry of the ﬂux-tube footprints breaks down. Their results
have not been reproduced since on a larger sample but the exclusive relation
between non-neutralized currents in MPILs and shearing/twisting motions has
been demonstrated via observations and models in subsequent studies (Janvier
et al., 2014; T¨or¨ok et al., 2014; Vemareddy, Venkatakrishnan, and Karthikreddy,
2015; Dalmasse et al., 2015). Although there is no general consensus on the causal
relationship between shearing motions and the Lorentz force, there seems to be
a consensus that substantial net currents are injected in the corona along strong

MPILs. Dissipative processes (magnetic reconnection) are required for current
neutralization, justifying the use of current–related quantities as ﬂare predictors.
Electric current densities have shown good correlation with ﬂaring and CME
activity (Falconer, Moore, and Gary, 2002; Yang et al., 2012) and have been
incorporated in ﬂare prediction schemes in several studies (Leka and Barnes,
2003a,b, 2007; Bobra and Couvidat, 2015). In these studies, electric current
related predictors rank among the best performing, motivating us to investigate
new ones, based on the systematic approach of Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c
(2012), where the eﬀects of numerical artefacts and magnetic ﬁeld measurement
errors are mitigated and the contribution of MPILs with strong shear, as poten-
tial ﬂaring sites in active regions, are intensiﬁed. Thus, we extend their results to
a large sample of active regions, aiming to produce a new current-based predictor
for use in the context of the FLARECAST project.

FLARECAST is a novel endeavour whose purpose is to produce real time ﬂare
predictions of unmatched accuracy. It aims to do so by incorporating the most
eﬃcient predictors and methods in a highly sophisticated prediction scheme,
exploiting advanced machine-learning techniques. Along with utilizing predictors
proposed so far in the literature, part of the project is devoted to developing new
ones. In this context, we investigate the ﬂare-prediction capability of the total
and maximum non-neutralized electric currents in active regions. Our sample is
statistically signiﬁcant and consists of thousands of space-based, active-region
vector magnetograms acquired during the present solar cycle 24.

2. Data set description: SHARP near real-time data

We use observations from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer
et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory mis-
sion (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012). Aiming to produce data
speciﬁcally directed to space weather research, the HMI team have developed the
Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP; Bobra et al., 2014). These
are cut-outs that contain the magnetic ﬁeld vector components, remapped and
deprojected as if observed at the solar disk center along with a set of quantities
used for predicting solar eruptions. In this study we use the near-real time (NRT),
cylindrical equal area (CEA) SHARP data. Aiming to use the non-neutralized
currents as predictors in an automated, ﬂare prediction service which will rely
on the automatically produced HARP cut-outs, no constrains on the solar disk
location have been imposed in this study.

To initially test the algorithm and its performance and whether there is a
correspondence between the evolution of the parameters and the ﬂaring activ-
ity of active regions, a sample of eleven National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) active regions (AR) was chosen. These AR and the
corresponding time-series durations, starts and ends were selected randomly
and show none, low, moderate or high ﬂare productivity. Table 1 summarizes
the time-series start and end, the Mt.Wilson classiﬁcation type as well as the
corresponding ﬂare productivity of the active regions.

SOLA: ms_rev.tex; 24 August 2017; 0:18; p. 4

Non-neutralized currents and ﬂare productivity

For further testing, we processed a representative sample of SHARP cut-outs.
336 random days were selected between September 2012 and May 2016, which
comprise the 25 % of the entire SHARP data coverage. For each day, we processed
SHARP cut-outs at a cadence of 6 h, resulting to 9454 data points.

The database of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES1)

is utilized to derive the ﬂare association of the SHARP observations. For every
HARP cut-out of our sample (both active region time–series and the represen-
tative sample), we derived the ﬂare onset times and classes, within the following
24 h. Speciﬁcally for the time series, we also calculated the total ﬂare index for
the duration of each time-series, using the formula of Abramenko (2005), that
is:

F I = (100S(X) + 10S(M) + 1.0S(C) + 0.1S(B))/∆t,

(1)

where S(X,M,C,B) is the, per class, sum of ﬂare magnitude (the number that
follows the class letter) and ∆t is the time interval in days. The number of ﬂares
per class and the total ﬂare index for the AR sample are shown in columns 4-8 of
Table 1. Concerning the representative sample of SHARP CEA NRT cut-outs,
out of the 9454 points of the sample, 2573, 212 and 16 are associated with C-,
M- and X-class ﬂares, respectively, over the preset window.

3. Analysis: Non-neutralized currents in solar active regions

We follow the method of Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c (2012), which incorporates
measurement uncertainties and poses strict criteria on deciding whether the
calculated currents are neutralized. Here we brieﬂy describe the method, while
the reader is referred to the original paper for more details.

The map of the radial component of the SHARP vector magnetic ﬁeld is
partitioned into non-overlapping patches of the same magnetic polarity, using
a gradient–based, ﬂux tessellation scheme (Barnes, Longcope, and Leka, 2005).
This partitioning method has also been used by Georgoulis and Rust (2007) for
the calculation of the eﬀective connected magnetic ﬁeld strength. To ensure that
quiet Sun magnetic elements will be excluded and only the sizable, active-region-
only magnetic polarities will be taken into account, thresholds on magnetic ﬁeld
strength, enclosed magnetic ﬂux and area are imposed. According to Georgoulis,
Titov, and Miki´c (2012), small changes in the selected thresholds do not alter the
essence of the results. Their conclusion was also veriﬁed in our dataset by testing
thresholds, e.g. magnetic ﬁeld strength up to 300 G and enclosed magnetic ﬂux
up to 1020 Mx. Using lower thresholds will result in more partitions, which will
not contribute to the calculations but will dramatically slow up the process.
The thresholds selected in magnetic ﬁeld strength, enclosed magnetic ﬂux and
size per partition are 100 G, 5·1019 Mx and 40 pixel correspondingly. Prior to
partitioning, the input magnetograms were smoothed, by a 5 × 5 pixel kernel, to

Kontogiannis et al.

produce partitions with slightly smoother boundaries and (in the case of time–
series) avoid dramatic changes of the partitioning process from frame to frame.
The process returns all non-overlapping partitions, along with their ﬂux weighted
centroid positions, boundaries and corresponding magnetic ﬂuxes.

For each partition, the vertical electric current density is calculated using the

diﬀerential form of Amp´ere’s law:

Jz =

1
µ0

(

∂By
∂x

−

∂Bx
∂y

)

(2)

where Bx, By are the two horizontal components of the magnetic ﬁeld and µ0
is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum. The total current Ii contained in
each partition is calculated as the algebraic sum of the contained Jz. The error
maps of the three components of the magnetic ﬁelds are used to calculate the
corresponding error δIi for each Ii. To decide whether Ii is non-neutralized, we
calculate the corresponding potential magnetic ﬁeld components (Alissandrakis,
1981) using the vertical magnetic ﬁeld Bz as boundary condition and repeat the
calculation for the potential magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The value of current
I pot
in this case should be, by deﬁnition, equal to zero. Due to numerical eﬀects,
i
however, non-zero results are produced. The total electric current, Ii, of a given
partition is considered non-neutralized, I N N
, if it satisﬁes the following criteria:
Ii > 5 × I pot
and Ii > 3 × δIi. From the set of non-neutralized partition currents
(if any) within the active region at a given time, we calculate the maximum
value, IN N,max, and the total unsigned non-neutralized current IN N,tot. The
latter is deﬁned as the sum of the absolute current values of the non-neutralized
partitions, I N N

i.e.:

i

i

i

IN N,tot =

|I N N
i

|

Xi

(3)

The rationale for selecting these two quantities is, as already mentioned, that
strong ﬂares in ARs are associated with MPILs, which are in turn associated with
strong non-neutralized currents (Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c, 2012; Dalmasse
et al., 2015; Vemareddy, Venkatakrishnan, and Karthikreddy, 2015). Several sites
in an active region may develop suitable conditions for ﬂaring. IN N,max may be
an indicator of the non-neutralized current that has increased at a certain site
while, if several such locations are indeed present (hence IN N,tot is increased),
then the active region should be even more prone to strong ﬂares.

It should be pointed out that our methodology ensures that the calculated
parameters are not size dependent but exclusively linked to the presence of strong
MPILs. In this sense, IN N,tot and IN N,max are not extensive but intensive and
therefore, neither the size of an active region nor the extent of the cut-out (so
long as it fully contains the active region) aﬀect the calculations.

We investigate the ﬂare-predictive capability of IN N,max and IN N,tot in a
twofold manner. First, we explore the time evolution of the non-neutralized
currents of active regions in comparison with their ﬂaring activity, in order to
assess whether the results of Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c (2012) extend to

SOLA: ms_rev.tex; 24 August 2017; 0:18; p. 6

Non-neutralized currents and ﬂare productivity

more than the two cases the authors presented. Then, the performance of the
two parameters is examined on a sizable sample of point-in-time observations,
which is representative of the sample that FLARECAST will rely on.

4. Results

4.1. General trends, and rationale for using non-neutralized currents

in the FLARECAST project

The purpose of this section is to assess whether 1) more ﬂare-productive AR
are linked with higher non-neutralized currents, 2) the two quantities show an
evolution similar to their ﬂare productivity and 3) this evolution is apt for
prediction, i.e. the increase of the two parameters precedes ﬂares and shows
some correlation with ﬂare class or ﬂare index within a given time-window.

In Fig. 1 we plot the temporal evolution of the IN N,tot and IN N,max for each of
the eleven active regions of the ﬁrst sample. It is clear that ﬂare productive AR
have higher IN N,tot and IN N,max values, by more than an order of magnitude.
The strongest ﬂares require the existence of systematically high non-neutralized
currents as e.g. in the case of AR 11429, 11515, 11748 and 11875. Another
interesting ﬁnding is that many strong ﬂares are preceded by a few hours of
increasing IN N,tot (e.g. AR 11158, 11515, 11875). This increase corresponds to
the emergence of new ﬂux and to the development of a strong PIL and is also
reﬂected on their magnetic type evolution (Table 1, last column).

Active regions with IN N,tot and IN N,max lower than 1012 A exhibit very low
or no ﬂaring activity at all. For instance, AR 11072 and AR 11663 produced
only B- or up to C1.1 class ﬂares, respectively. In the latter case, these ﬂares
were clustered around relatively enhanced non-neutralized currents, during the
second day. This clustering of ﬂares during well deﬁned peaks of IN N,tot is also
observed in AR 11640, which exhibits more frequent ﬂaring activity, owing to its
overall higher values of IN N,tot and IN N,max.

To some extent, the more sizable, ﬂare–productive active regions also exhibit
repeated ﬂaring activity during peaks of the two parameters, although these
peaks do not stand out clearly but lie on an increased background. This is due to
the fact that these active regions contain many non-neutralized partitions along
intense MPIL, which increase the total amount of non-neutralized current. More
careful inspection shows that even for these active regions, the long temporal
increase of non-neutralized currents exhibits structure in ﬁner temporal scales,
manifested by shorter peaks on top of the general trend. This is seen mostly
at the IN N,tot curve while the IN N,max curve is less inclined. This diﬀerence
may be due to the fact that the non-neutralized current of a given partition
may not increase above a certain limit. Instead, it is the increasing number of
non-neutralized partitions that results in an overall increase of IN N,tot. Note,
also, that intense ﬂaring activity is found at times when IN N,tot is several times
higher than IN N,max. We will return to this remark in the next section. By
incorporating the added eﬀect of multiple non-neutralized partitions within an

SOLA: ms_rev.tex; 24 August 2017; 0:18; p. 7

Kontogiannis et al.

active region, IN N,tot seems to represent its evolution more eﬃciently and, in
this sense, it may prove a more eﬃcient ﬂare predictor than IN N,max.

Accumulation of non-neutralized currents in active-region partitions as part
of an energy build-up process may be clearly seen in AR 11158, 11429, 11515
and 11875. In AR 11158, the ﬂux emergence that is observed at the end of the
second day is accompanied by an increase of the total non-neutralized currents,
showing that ﬂux emergence results in the injection of net currents in the active-
region corona. This is in line with previous results on the origin of the non-
neutralized currents. Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c (2012) used a dimensionless
non-neutralization factor to show that two active regions with very diﬀerent ﬂare
productivity were coherent structures. This lead the authors to conclude that
the non-neutralized currents they contained had a sub-photospheric origin. Their
results were corroborated by the MHD simulations of T¨or¨ok et al. (2014), which
showed that active regions are born with substantial non-neutralized currents.
The association between non-neutralized current increase and ﬂaring–CME
activity has been implied in previous studies (see e.g. Ravindra et al., 2011;
Janvier et al., 2014; Vemareddy, Venkatakrishnan, and Karthikreddy, 2015). In
most of these studies, which prompt the evolution of an AR, this association
was inferred a posteriori, by manually selecting regions of interest, based on
the sites of recorded ﬂaring activity (around MPILs). On the contrary, judging
by Fig. 1, it seems that the temporal variation of IN N,tot and IN N,max brings
out the evolution of non-neutralized currents at the regions of interest as clear
enhancements on top of the overall evolution. During the strongest ﬂares, the
total non-neutralized current continues to increase, showing that the free energy
build-up process continues and ﬂares remove only a part of this energy. According
to Janvier et al. (2014), a local increase of the current may be observed after the
ﬂare at the footpoints of the ribbons.

It has been shown that strong direct currents, with weak or no return currents
(implying the existence of non-neutralized currents) are compatible with the
existence of twisted ﬂux ropes (Schrijver et al., 2008). For instance, AR 11429 was
one of the most ﬂare productive of cycle 24, whose total non-neutralized current
content is the largest of the sample (along with that of AR 11515). AR 11429
exhibited strong MPIL, with strong shear, indicative of strong deviations from
non-potentiality, justifying the build-up of large amounts of IN N,tot. It produced
two X-class ﬂares at the end of day 3, both accompanied by CMEs, which were
preceded by the formation of magnetic ﬂux ropes (Chintzoglou, Patsourakos,
and Vourlidas, 2015; Syntelis et al., 2016). The X-class ﬂare of the well studied
AR 11158 has also been associated with a ﬂux rope formation (Inoue et al., 2015).
These comparisons are useful as they possibly link the proposed predictors with
the underlying physics of the ﬂaring phenomenon. A more detailed examination
exceeds the scope of the present study and will be reserved for the future.

From a ﬂare-forecasting point of view, one may coarsely infer IN N,tot thresh-
olds of 0.5 · 1012, 5 · 1012 and 15 · 1012 A for C-, M- and X-class ﬂares to occur.
However, apart from one case where a C-class ﬂare occurred for 0.5 · 1012 A
(AR 11663), for the rest of the sample, a IN N,tot value of at least 3 · 1012 A was
observed. Of course these thresholds are indicative: the actual merit of IN N,tot
and IN N,max will be examined in the next section. Still, the good correspondence

Non-neutralized currents and ﬂare productivity

between IN N,tot, IN N,max and ﬂare productivity is also illustrated in Fig. 2.
There, we plot the ﬂare index during the observation interval for each AR of
Fig. 1 along with the corresponding temporal averages of the two examined
predictors. From this plot it is also conﬁrmed that quiet and ﬂare-productive
ARs diﬀer by more than an order of magnitude in terms of non-neutralized
current content. The Pearson correlation coeﬃcients between FI and IN N,tot,
IN N,max are 0.869631 and 0.865931, respectively. It is, therefore, concluded that
the ﬂare productivity of active regions is very well correlated with their amount
of non-neutralized electric currents.

4.2. IN N,tot and IN N,max as solar ﬂare predictors

Manually selected active region samples are useful to (visually) assess whether
there is ﬂare predictive potential in certain active region properties, in order
to test the performance of the calculation algorithms and ﬁne–tune the input
parameters. Also, the time evolution of these properties often allows to derive
some association with the physical processes involved in the ﬂaring phenomenon.
Nevertheless, these samples, however randomly selected, are inherently diﬀerent
than the ones actually used in automated prediction services, where photospheric
magnetogram cut-outs are produced in real time and no (human biased) selec-
tion eﬀects apply. To accommodate an examination of IN N,tot and IN N,max in
“realistic” conditions, we use the representative sample of 9454 SHARP CEA
NRT vector magnetograms.

The corresponding non-zero IN N,tot and IN N,max are presented as a scatter
plot in Fig. 3 along with color–coded ﬂare association information. It is clearly
seen that most cut-outs associated with major ﬂares within the next 24 h (marked
with yellow and red crosses) are found towards the upper right corner i.e. are as-
sociated with higher non-neutralized electrical currents. Therefore, it seems that
the two parameters allow a partial separation between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring
regions. For major ﬂares to occur within the following 24 h, coarse thresholds
of IN N,tot and IN N,max may be derived: 5 · 1011 A (IN N,tot) and 1.9 · 1011 A
(IN N,max) for M-class ﬂares and 4.6 · 1012 A (IN N,tot) and 8 · 1011 A (IN N,max)
for X-class ﬂares.

From the examination of the time evolution of the parameters at the previous
section (Fig. 1), it was found that intense ﬂaring occurs at times when the
diﬀerence between IN N,tot and IN N,max is largest while at quiet phases, the
two quantities are roughly equal (or both close to zero). Fig. 3 allows us to
extend these results to a larger sample. It can be seen that no major ﬂares
are found below the IN N,tot = IN N,max line: M- and X-class ﬂares require
IN N,tot > 1.5 · IN N,max and IN N,tot > 3.5 · IN N,max respectively. Therefore,
major ﬂares require the presence of many non-neutralized partitions. A large
number of non-neutralized partitions denotes the presence of a stronger, more
fragmented MPIL. It is well established that strong complicated MPILs are
linked with high non-potentiality of the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Falconer, Moore, and
Gary, 2002; Schrijver, 2007) and strong shear and are, consequently related to
major ﬂares. It is reasonable to suggest that if an AR contains several MPILS or
one extended/more complicated MPIL, it is more prone to ﬂare. While it seems

that one single partition may reach a speciﬁc amount of non-neutralized current
(reﬂecting to high IN N,max), the presence of many non-neutralized partitions
(either because there are several non-neutralized partitions along a MPIL or
because there are several MPILS within an AR) results to IN N,tot being several
times higher than IN N,max. Therefore, the ﬁndings of Fig. 3 are an alternative
way to demonstrate that strong, fragmented MPILs are required for major ﬂares
and that this requirement is eﬀectively incorporated in the deﬁnition of IN N,tot.
Next, we compare the performance of IN N,tot and IN N,max with that of the
total unsigned ﬂux, Φtot, and the two electric current-related parameters given
by the SHARP team, that is the total vertical current Jz,tot and the sum of
the modulus of the average net current per polarity Jz,sum (Bobra et al., 2014).
The two latter parameters express the amount of net current in an active region
and the aim of the comparison is to investigate in practice whether IN N,tot and
IN N,max have meaningful or trivial diﬀerences with these already established
parameters.

The scatter plots between parameters calculated for each of the 9454 points
are found in Fig. 4. Cut-outs associated with ﬂares of diﬀerent classes that
occur over the next 24 hours are denoted diﬀerently. The calculation process
produced zero or no results for many cases. This is either because some cut-outs
contained no non-neutralized partitions, or because the partitioning process was,
at times, unable to provide eligible partitions as per the preset thresholds. Both
cases may include decaying or developing AR without MPILs and are treated
as corresponding to zero IN N,tot and IN N,max. These points are included in all
panels of Fig. 4 at ordinate equal to 1010 A.

In general, all panels in Fig. 4 imply, at best, a weak correlation between the
examined parameters. The highest values of Φtot and Jz, correlate better with
IN N,tot and IN N,max. These points also correspond to increased ﬂaring activity,
as most of the major ﬂares (yellow and red crosses) are concentrated there.

Also, it is obvious that zero non-neutralized electric currents do not corre-
spond to zero Φtot, Jz and Jz,sum. These are, by deﬁnition, extensive parameters,
i.e. they increase with the size of the active region and/or the extent of the
cut-out and acquire non-zero values. On the other hand, IN N,tot and IN N,max
are intensive (non-extensive) parameters, as they depend only on the size and
strength of the MPIL and are zero when no MPIL are formed, regardless of the
cut-out extent. In our sample we ﬁnd that only a very small fraction of these
cut-outs (∼0.5%) are associated with C-class ﬂares and none of them with M-
or X-class ﬂares.

The qualitative characteristics of the scatter plots of Fig. 4 are quantiﬁed,
in terms of ﬂare-forecasting potential, by the Bayesian inferred probabilities
(Georgoulis, 2012a; Wheatland, 2005) in Fig. 5. For a given threshold, normalized
to the maximum value of each parameter to facilitate comparison, we count
the total number, N, of active regions with a parameter value higher than the
threshold and the number, F, out of them, that are ﬂaring within the next 24 h.
Then, the Bayesian probability is given by:

p =

F + 1
N + 2

The calculated Bayesian probabilities of the ﬁve parameters as functions of
the normalized thresholds are shown in Fig. 5. Both non-neutralized current
parameters produce more signiﬁcant probabilities than Φtot, Jz and Jz,sum for
a range of normalized thresholds. As expected, IN N,tot is more eﬃcient. For
C- and higher than C-class ﬂares the diﬀerence with Φtot starts at ∼0.1 for
low thresholds and surpasses 0.4. For major solar ﬂares, the performance of
IN N,tot is signiﬁcantly better than the Φtot. It should be noted that for very
high thresholds, uncertainties increase, as the number of eligible data points (N)
becomes smaller, decreasing the signiﬁcance of the statistical sample. The results
of Fig. 5 suggest that IN N,tot and IN N,max are more eﬃcient than Φtot, Jz and
Jz,sum at segregating ﬂaring from non-ﬂaring active regions. They are, therefore,
worth considering as ﬂare predictors.

5. Conclusions and Discussion

In the context of an operational ﬂare-forecasting service, we processed a sizeable
sample of SDO/HMI SHARP cut-outs, aiming to examine the forecasting poten-
tial of two predictors related to the amount of non-neutralized electric currents
contained in active regions. For the ﬁrst time, we studied the evolution of the
total and maximum unsigned non-neutralized currents, IN N,tot and IN N,max,
for eleven active regions, as well as their performance in ﬂare prediction in a
representative sample of SHARP CEA NRT data, consisting of 9454 cut-outs.

A brief discussion of the temporal evolution of these two new parameters
showed that they correspond to physical processes such as MPIL formation
and, as per previous studies, of a possible ﬂux rope formation, closely related
with intense ﬂaring activity. Having focused on the potential of the IN N,tot and
IN N,max as solar ﬂare predictors, however, we did not discuss thoroughly the
origin and evolution of non-neutralized currents in active regions. This is a long
standing question that has been addressed through simulations and observations
(Georgoulis, 2017, in press) and a more detailed investigation is pending.

Both parameters are closely associated with ﬂare productivity, conﬁrming and
extending the conclusions drawn by Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c (2012). It was
shown for the ﬁrst time, using a large representative sample of solar cycle 24, that
both predictors are worth considering in automated ﬂare prediction schemes. Out
of the two proposed predictors, IN N,tot characterizes the ﬂaring potential of an
active region more eﬃciently because it encompasses the contributions of all
possible ﬂare-producing sites within an active region.

An important advantage of these predictors is that they include a detailed
error analysis in the calculations of the non-neutralized currents. This approach
has proven to be safe in concluding whether the currents in ARs are neutralized
(Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c, 2012). The immediate comparison with the po-
tential ﬁeld ensures that the measured currents are existing and signiﬁcant as per

existing observations, not due to the numerical eﬀects that arise when analytical
expressions (such as Amp´ere’s law) are applied to discretized distributions of
continuous physical quantities (such as the magnetic ﬂux density). Therefore,
possibly erroneous electric currents are constrained. Qualitatively, our results
also suggest that the method used does not depend on the resolution of the pro-
cessed magnetograms. The method was originally developed for Hinode SOT/SP
magnetograms, the highest resolution available up to date, and in this study it
was applied to the lower resolution SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. For all
the reasons mentioned, IN N,tot is more advantageous than other commonly used
current parameters, such as the total vertical current density, Jz, or the total
unsigned current per polarity.

Thus said, the association between IN N,tot and Jz is not trivial since by
deﬁnition, there is no linear relationship between the two predictors. The total
unsigned current of an active region is an extensive parameter, meaning that, in
principle, it increases with the size of the active region (similarly to Φtot). Non
neutralized currents, on the other hand, should be zero for active regions that do
not contain strong MPILs or for SHARP cut-outs that lack one polarity, regard-
less of their magnetic ﬂux content and vertical electric current density. Therefore,
IN N,tot and IN N,max are non-extensive parameters (as the lack of correlation
in Fig. 4 also demonstrates), which incorporate in a physical way morphologi-
cal information in active regions with possible (and plausible) implications for
ﬂare-triggering (i.e. strong and sheared MPILs). Given that current–related pa-
rameters have shown good prospects for ﬂare prediction (Bobra and Couvidat,
2015), we expect improved results for IN N,tot. Also, non-extensive parameters
were found to outperform the extensive ones in CME prediction (Bobra and
Ilonidis, 2016) which means that there may be some potential in extending the
usage of IN N,tot to CME prediction as well.

In view of numerous studies on solar ﬂare prediction, it has now become
apparent that no single ﬂare predictor suﬃces to categorically forecast solar ﬂares
and that active regions are complex dynamical systems where more than one pa-
rameters are involved in ﬂare triggering. Investigating the evolution and absolute
magnitudes of non-neutralized electric currents is more attractive and tractable
in the era of systematically and regularly available vector magnetogram. It is thus
tempting to explore the possibility of producing, in the future, several predictors
that involve such currents. For the moment, we are planning to include IN N,tot
in the set of predictors that will feed machine learning algorithms (Florios et al.
2017, in prep.), in the framework of the FLARECAST project, at the same time
investigating their physical signiﬁcance via the project’s explorative research
component.

Appendix

A. Diﬀerential versus integral form of Amp´ere’s law

In the original work of Georgoulis, Titov, and Miki´c (2012), the integral form of
Amp´ere’s law was chosen as being more accurate, albeit more time-consuming.
To examine the trade-of between speed and accuracy we used both versions to
calculate the total unsigned non-neutralized current for AR 11158. The results
are shown in Fig. 6, where it is seen that the two versions produce practically
the same results. For the longer part of the time-series, currents calculated by
the two versions are the same within uncertainties. For most of the points, the
diﬀerences are within the error and the two curves diﬀer only at a few points.
Overall, the diﬀerential form of Amp´ere’s law produces slightly smoother curves,
since it utilizes a larger number of pixels, smoothing out diﬀerences from image to
image (which could be due to noise or errors in the azimuth disambiguation and
deprojection). Being based on the deﬁnition of a “correct” contour around each
partition, the integral form is more sensitive to such variations. In view of this
result, and given the fact that the integral form of Amp´ere’s law is signiﬁcantly
more time-consuming, we chose to use the diﬀerential form to calculate the
electric currents that correspond to each partition.

Figure 5. Bayesian inferred probabilities of INN,tot (red) and INN,max (orange) compared
with that of Φtot (black),Jz (green) and Jz,sum (cyan), for C-, M-, X-, above C- and above
M-class ﬂares. Φtot, Jz, Jz,sum, INN,tot and INN,max thresholds have been normalized to
the corresponding maximum values, i.e. 1.68917 · 1023 Mx, 2.59441 · 1014 A, 4.21399 · 1013 A,
7.52898 · 1013 A and 6.06393 · 1012 A, respectively
