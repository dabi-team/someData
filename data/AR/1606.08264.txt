ABSTRACT

We investigate whether ﬂux cancellation is responsible for the formation of a very massive
ﬁlament resulting in the spectacular 2011 June 7 eruption. We analyse and quantify the amount
of ﬂux cancellation that occurs in NOAA AR 11226 and its two neighbouring ARs (11227 &
11233) using line-of-sight magnetograms from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager. During a 3.6-
day period building up to the ﬁlament eruption, 1.7 × 1021 Mx, 21% of AR 11226’s maximum
magnetic ﬂux, was cancelled along the polarity inversion line (PIL) where the ﬁlament formed.
If the ﬂux cancellation continued at the same rate up until the eruption then up to 2.8 × 1021 Mx
(34 % of the AR ﬂux) may have been built into the magnetic conﬁguration that contains the
ﬁlament plasma. The large ﬂux cancellation rate is due to an unusual motion of the positive
polarity sunspot, which splits, with the largest section moving rapidly towards the PIL. This
motion compresses the negative polarity and leads to the formation of an orphan penumbra where
one end of the ﬁlament is rooted. Dense plasma threads above the orphan penumbra build into
the ﬁlament, extending its length, and presumably injecting material into it. We conclude that
the exceptionally strong ﬂux cancellation in AR 11226 played a signiﬁcant role in the formation of
its unusually massive ﬁlament. In addition, the presence and coherent evolution of bald patches in
the vector magnetic ﬁeld along the PIL suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration supporting
the ﬁlament material is that of a ﬂux rope.

Introduction

Filaments, composed of relatively cool and
dense plasma, are a common feature in the solar
atmosphere and understanding their formation
is an open question in solar physics. Filaments
typically take up to several days to form and lie
above photospheric polarity inversion lines (PIL)
(Babcock & Babcock 1955). Despite decades of
observations, the conditions for ﬁlament forma-
tion remain unclear, with a variety of mechanisms
proposed to explain the formation process.

To resolve the unanswered question of ﬁlament
formation, we must consider two aspects. First,
the magnetic conﬁguration that can support the
plasma in the solar atmosphere against gravity.
Regarding the magnetic models the magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁgurations do not necessarily invoke dips in the
magnetic ﬁeld e.g. Martin & Echols (1994). Al-
though, one common feature of ﬁlament models is
the presence of sheared magnetic ﬁeld along the
PIL. This can either be in the form of a weakly
twisted magnetic ﬂux rope (Kuperus & Raadu
1974; Pneuman 1983; van Ballegooijen & Martens

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
1989) or a sheared arcade (Antiochos et al. 1994;
DeVore & Antiochos 2000; Aulanier et al. 2002).
The second aspect to be considered is the origin
of the ﬁlament plasma itself. This must be sup-
plied either from the chromosphere, through the
emergence of new magnetic ﬂux lifting plasma into
the atmosphere (Rust & Kumar 1994; Deng et al.
2000) or through direct injection of chromospheric
plasma (Poland & Mariska 1986; Wang 1999), or
via condensation from the corona (Engvold & Jen-
son 1977; An et al. 1985).

In this study we investigate the role that ﬂux
cancellation may play in the origin of the plasma in
an eruptive ﬁlament. We also investigate how the
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration evolves as ﬂux can-
cellation is proceeding to ﬁnd indications of the
onset of the ﬁlament’s eruption as a coronal mass
ejection.

Photospheric ﬂux cancellation is observed as
the convergence, collision and subsequent dis-
appearance of small-scale opposite-polarity mag-
netic features in line-of-sight (LoS) magnetograms
(Martin et al. 1985). These cancelling features
can be as small as a few hundred kilometres across
with magnetic ﬂuxes as low as ∼ 1017 Mx (Litvi-
nenko & Martin 1999). The cancellation process
is observed throughout the quiet Sun and in active
regions (ARs) at all stages of their evolution. In
ARs, the cancellation is observed both between
the main magnetic polarities (along the internal
PIL) and between magnetic ﬂux at the AR pe-
riphery and surrounding magnetic ﬁelds.

The opposite polarity fragments that collide
and subsequently disappear are interpreted as rep-
resenting the footpoints of two magnetic ﬂux sys-
tems that are sheared across the PIL. These fea-
tures, during collision, undergo magnetic recon-
nection, which takes place low in the solar atmo-
sphere; either in the photosphere (Yurchyshyn &
Wang 2001; Bellot Rubio & Beck 2005) or the
chromosphere (Litvinenko & Martin 1999; Chae
et al. 2001; Kim et al. 2001; Livinenko 2015).

The magnetic reconnection leads to the forma-
tion of two magnetic ﬂux systems that diﬀer in
connectivity to the pre-reconnection pair: there is
now a small loop with a radius of curvature that
provides a strong downward tension force and,
above this, the formation of highly sheared ﬁeld
that has a concave-up section above the recon-
nection region. The disappearance of the oppo-

2

site polarity fragments during ﬂux cancellation is
then the observational manifestation of the sub-
mergence of the small loop, whilst the longer loop
remains in the solar atmosphere.

This physical interpretation of ﬂux cancellation
is of direct relevance to the study of ﬁlaments.
During reconnection, the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀuses
through the dense plasma of the lower atmosphere
and theoretical studies have shown that reconnec-
tion occurring low in the solar atmosphere can ef-
fectively drive the mass required for ﬁlament for-
mation upwards (Priest et al. 1996; Litvinenko &
Martin 1999; Litvinenko et al. 2007). Therefore,
ﬂux cancellation may play a key role in the ori-
gin of ﬁlament plasma. If this is indeed the case,
the quantity of plasma injected into a forming ﬁl-
ament could be expected to scale with the amount
of magnetic ﬂux cancellation observed.

The physical processes that lead to the obser-
vation of ﬂux cancellation can also be used to in-
vestigate the magnetic ﬁeld environment of the
ﬁlament. At the internal PIL of ARs, the ﬂux
cancellation process initially builds highly sheared
ﬁeld along the PIL and dips in this magnetic con-
ﬁguration that could support ﬁlament material.
However, ongoing ﬂux cancellation by sustained
magnetic reconnection will eventually form helical
magnetic ﬁelds around the sheared arcade. This
can therefore reconﬁgure the magnetic ﬁeld from
a sheared coronal arcade into a magnetic ﬂux rope
conﬁguration (see Figure 1 of van Ballegooijen &
Martens 1989). Concave-up sections in a mag-
netic ﬂux rope conﬁguration also provide locations
where ﬁlament plasma can be supported. Such a
scenario for ﬂux rope formation is well supported
by simulations (Amari et al. 2003; Aulanier et al.
2010). Whether the magnetic ﬁeld environment of
a ﬁlament is that of a sheared arcade or weakly
twisted ﬂux rope is a challenging question to an-
swer without direct measurements of the magnetic
ﬁeld above the photosphere. However, several
observational proxies have been developed. The
main proxy relevant to active region ﬁlaments are
so-called “bald-patches” (BPs), where the photo-
spheric vector magnetic ﬁeld at the underside of
the ﬁlament is tangent to the photosphere and
crosses the PIL in the inverse direction. This is
indicative of the presence of concave-up sections
of magnetic ﬁeld, formed, e.g. at the bottom of
a low-lying ﬂux rope (Athay et al. 1983; Lites et

al. 2005; L´opez Ariste et al. 2006; Canou et al.
2009). Understanding the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration of a ﬁlament at its point of eruption is vi-
tal for understanding the physical mechanisms the
trigger and drive the event. If ﬁlaments form in
a magnetic ﬂux rope conﬁguration, their eruption
as a coronal mass ejection (CME) can be under-
stood as a loss of equilibrium or an ideal instabil-
ity of the rope (Forbes & Isenberg 1991; Fan &
Gibson 2003; T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2003; D´emoulin &
Aulanier 2010). If ﬁlament material is supported
in a sheared arcade the expansion and reconnec-
tion within the structure can produce the eruption
(Antiochos et al. 1999; Moore et al. 2001). Flux
cancellation observations provide a way to inves-
tigate how much magnetic ﬂux has been built into
the magnetic conﬁguration before eruption, such
as the magnetic ﬂux of the structure containing
the ﬁlament material in relation to the overlying,
restraining ﬁeld of the AR. This is key to under-
standing the onset of CMEs.

Previous ﬂux cancellation studies in ARs which
form ﬁlaments and produce CMEs have exhibited
cancellation rates of 10% of the AR ﬂux per day
with a total of 1 × 1021 Mx cancelled during the
time period studied (Sterling et al. 2010; Baker et
al. 2012). Green et al. (2011) studied ﬂux can-
cellation along the PIL of AR 10977 through the
entire period commencing at the start of the ﬂux
emergence phase, through the decay phase to the
occurrence of the ﬁrst CME produced by the re-
gion. They found that 0.71 × 1021 Mx (∼34% of
the AR ﬂux) cancelled in the 2.5 days leading up
to the eruption.

The study presented here focuses on the ﬂux
cancellation that occurs along the internal PIL of
AR 11226, during the time that a ﬁlament along
the PIL is growing in size. The ﬁlament erupted
on 2011 June 7 at ∼06:15 UT. Prior to eruption
the ﬁlament, located in the southern hemisphere,
appeared ordinary in both appearance and size.
However, the ﬁlament exploded and unleashed a
vast amount of material that experienced a huge
lateral expansion as it was launched into the solar
system. Much of the material fell back towards
the photosphere as discrete, dense blobs impacting
almost a quarter of the solar surface.

Recent work by Carlyle et al. (2014) indicates
that the ﬁlament contained a huge amount of
mass, given that, even after expansion, the column

densities of the individual blobs are comparable to
that of a typical pre-eruption ﬁlament (Gilbert et
al. 2005). van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2014) noticed
remarkably strong ﬂux cancellation along the PIL
in the four days leading up to the eruption, but
the cancellation was never quantiﬁed.

The combination of these observations, mea-
surements and the remarkable nature of the
erupted material suggests the amount of magnetic
ﬂux built into the magnetic conﬁguration of the ﬁl-
ament and the free energy stored in the ﬁeld must
have been colossal. We investigate the possibil-
ity that the ﬁlament that erupted on 2011 June 7
was exceptionally massive because of an especially
high ﬂux cancellation rate.

This paper is organised as follows.

In Sec-
tion 2 we describe the instrumentation used and
the application of the algorithm. In Section 3 we
present the ﬁlament, LoS and vector ﬁeld evolu-
tion, penumbra formation and ﬂux cancellation
rate.
In Section 4 we discuss the unusual pho-
tospheric motions and high ﬂux cancellation rate,
which is followed by our conclusions in Section 5.

Instrumentation & Algorithm Applica-
tion

2.1.

Instrumentation

In this study we compared and analysed data
from a wide range of instruments that collectively
observe from the photosphere to the corona. The
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et
al. 2012) instrument onboard the Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory (SDO) provides full-disk observa-
tions in three UV continuum wavelengths as well
as seven EUV bandpasses with a high temporal
and spatial resolution of 12 s and 1.5” respec-
tively. We focus on the wavebands 304 and 193 ˚A,
which are dominated by plasma emission at tem-
peratures of approximately 0.05 (304 ˚A), 1.2 and
20 MK (193 ˚A), to study the location and evo-
lution of the ﬁlament material. Hα images from
the Kanzelh¨ohe Observatory were also analysed to
determine the location of ﬁlament material.

The evolution of the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld is studied using data from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012;
Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard SDO. This includes
the calculation of the magnetic ﬂux cancellation
rate by using full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magne-

3

tograms computed from ﬁltergrams sampled at six
points across the Fe I 6173 ˚A absorption spectral
line. These ﬁltergrams are recorded by the vec-
tor ﬁeld camera with a pixel size of 0.5” pixel−1
and a noise level of 10 G. Multiple measurements
are combined to give a 720 s cadence. The CEA
HMI SHARP 720s data series (Hoeksema et al.
2014; Bobra et al. 2014) are analysed to investi-
gate the orientation of the transverse component
of the vector magnetic ﬁeld along the PIL.

HMI continuum data is used to study the
sunspot evolution and penumbral dynamics dur-
ing the ﬁlament formation. To quantify sunspot
proper motions and velocities the Debrecen Photo-
heliographic Data sunspot catalogue (DPD; Gy˝ori
et al. 2011) was used. This catalogue is mainly
composed of
full-disk white light observations
taken at the Debrecen Observatory, although sev-
eral ground- and space-based observations are now
included. It contains accounts of position and area
for all sunspots, irrespective of size, with a mean
precision of ∼0.1◦ and ∼10 % respectively. We
identiﬁed the main spots and determined the ve-
locity of their proper motion from the published
daily positions.

Additionally, 195 ˚A EUV images produced by
the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Helio-
spheric Investigation (SECCHI) onboard the So-
lar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO;
Howard et al. 2008) spacecraft are used to observe
the emergence of AR 11226, which took place on
the far-side of the Sun. The observations are pro-
vided by the STEREO-B spacecraft, which is po-
sitioned at 93.6◦ away from the Sun-Earth line at
the time of the observations.

2.2. Application of the STEF Algorithm

The photospheric ﬁeld evolution of AR 11226,
and its two neighbouring regions as a compari-
son, were studied using the 720 s data series avail-
able from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI). The magnetic complexity is monitored,
whilst the total ﬂux content of the ARs is quanti-
ﬁed by using the Solar Tracking of the Evolution of
photospheric Flux (STEF) algorithm. STEF auto-
matically detects and tracks both small- and large-
scale magnetic features in LoS magnetograms and
is used to study the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of
ARs throughout their lifetimes from ﬂux emer-
gence to dispersal.

4

AR areas are identiﬁed by eye and the ﬁeld of
view is assigned as a rectangular area, the size of
which is speciﬁed by the user. The radial com-
ponent of the magnetic ﬁeld is then estimated by
applying a cosine correction using the Heliocen-
tric Earth Equatorial Coordinate system (HEEQ)
(Thompson 2006). The magnetogram containing
the radialised ﬁeld values is then diﬀerentially ro-
tated to the central meridian passage time of the
region of interest to correct for projection eﬀects
using a routine that has been developed in Sunpy.
The ﬂux-weighted central coordinates of this
area are calculated at each time step to track the
feature such that it remains in the centre of the
ﬁeld of view. The magnetic features are then se-
lected as follows. First a Gaussian ﬁlter is used to
smooth the data with a standard deviation (width)
of the applied Gaussian of 7 pixel units. The
weighted average of the magnetic ﬂux density of
the neighbouring pixels must exceed a cut-oﬀ of 40
G. The largest regions identiﬁed are kept and make
up at least 60% of the selected area, whereas the
smaller features at large distances are disregarded.
This is to remove quiet Sun features which are not
part of the AR, although small-scale features will
still enter or exit the boundary which introduces
a contribution or reduction to the magnetic ﬂux.
These ﬂuctuations are at least three orders of mag-
nitude less than the total AR ﬂux.

When used on data from the quiet Sun only, the
algorithm applies no smoothing and selects pixels
above a threshold of 3 σ, where σ is the accuracy
of the LoS magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. 30 G for HMI and
60 G for MDI). As false positives are more likely to
occur in the detection of a small collection of pixels
a second criterion is applied, namely that features
must also be equal to or larger than 4 pixels in size
(0.54 Mm2 for HMI, 8 Mm2 for MDI).

Once the pixels have been selected, the cor-
responding magnetic ﬂux density values are ex-
tracted, summed and multiplied by the area to
obtain the total magnetic ﬂux. The outputs of
this algorithm include: total positive and negative
pixel area; total positive, negative and unsigned
magnetic ﬂux; the distance and tilt angle between
the ﬂux-weighted central coordinates. Kernel den-
sity estimation plots are created, using either a
Gaussian or a box kernel to show the frequency of
pixels with respect to ﬂux density.

The amount of ﬂux cancelled is calculated from

the reduction in total magnetic ﬂux. This ap-
proach can be used in this AR since ﬂux cancella-
tion at the AR periphery and ﬂux fragments leav-
ing the boundary of the region are are at least
three orders of magnitude less than the total AR
ﬂux. STEF calculates both the positive and neg-
ative ﬂux of the AR but we focus on the total un-
signed magnetic ﬂux (half the total positive and
negative ﬂux) for calculating ﬂux cancellation.

3. Observations

3.1. Filament Evolution

The ﬁlament being studied here formed in AR
11226 which rotated onto the solar disk on 2011
May 27 and was part of a three AR complex; the
other two regions being ARs 11227 and 11233, lo-
cated to the east of AR 11226. See Figure 2 and
also Figure 1 in van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2014)
for the arrangement of the ARs. Filament mate-
rial is already present along the internal PIL of AR
11226 as it rotates over the limb. During its disk
passage the ﬁlament is involved in two eruptions
before the event that takes place on 2011 June
7. These two eruptions take place on 2011 May
29 and June 1. The CME on 2011 June 1 erupts
from the region at ∼16:00 UT. The eruption re-
moves some, but not all, of the ﬁlament material.
The ﬁlament therefore has a quiet phase between
the CMEs on 2011 June 1 and June 7.

Using the AIA 193 ˚A waveband, the ﬁlament
material that remains after the eruption on 2011
June 1 is seen to be present in two main sections,
which overlap at the central part of the PIL (Fig-
ure 2 panel (a)). Late on June 2 the overlapping
sections begin to thicken and have merged to form
one long ﬁlament structure situated along the PIL
by late on June 4 (Figure 2 (b)). Then, adja-
cent to the southern end of the ﬁlament, strands
of relatively cool plasma build into the ﬁlament
during June 5 and early on June 6 (Figure 2(c)).
The growth of the southern end of the ﬁlament
appears to be mostly complete by noon on June 6
(Figure 2 (d)).

3.2. Photospheric Field Evolution

The AR complex is studied during the period
beginning on 2011 June 1 at 00:00 UT until June 6
06:00 UT (a day before the eruption being studied
here). After June 6 06:00 UT, the leading edge

5

of the positive polarity in AR 11226 is too close
(∼ 60◦ longitude) to the limb to be able to make
reliable ﬂux measurements using the LoS magne-
togram data. The three ARs in the complex dif-
fer in ﬂux content. AR 11226 is a large region
with a maximum ﬂux of 8.2 × 1021 Mx during
the time period studied, whereas AR 11227 and
11233 are smaller regions with maximum ﬂuxes of
3.2 × 1021 Mx and 2.2 × 1021 Mx, respectively.

AR 11226 is seen to emerge on the far side of
the Sun on 2011 May 25 in EUVI observations
from STEREO B. From the Earth’s perspective,
AR 11226 rotates over the east limb in a roughly
bipolar conﬁguration. The opposite polarities are
butted up against each other with initially the AR
having umbrae of opposite polarity spots within a
single penumbra. This is reﬂected in the Mount
Wilson magnetic classiﬁcation, which categorises
the AR as having a βδ classiﬁcation until May 30
followed by a βγ conﬁguration until June 4. The
opposite polarities never fully separate and this
suggests that AR 11226 is formed by the emer-
gence of a complicated conﬁguration such as the
emergence of a highly twisted or distorted ﬂux
tube.

Throughout the seven days leading up to the
eruption, the photospheric ﬁeld evolution of AR
11226 is very dynamic (Figure 3). The posi-
tive polarity (leading) sunspot starts to split on
2011 May 31 and continues its division on June
1. One part remains as a stationary spot, whilst
the largest section (labelled S in Figure 3) breaks
away and continues to move in the south-east di-
rection towards the PIL. Then, around June 2
12:00 UT, the sunspot divides again into several
portions with the largest (still labelled S) continu-
ing to move rapidly towards the PIL. The proper
motion of sunspot S was calculated by using the
change in heliographic latitude and longitude in
the Kanzelh¨ohe data provided by the DPD cata-
logue. Over the period of three days (June 2–4)
the velocity of the sunspot as it moves towards the
PIL was calculated to be 0.19 km s−1.

Overall, the positive magnetic polarity becomes
elongated and the sunspots are seen to exhibit sub-
stantial moving magnetic feature (MMF) activity,
with a large proportion of these features stream-
ing towards the PIL. In previous work it has been
found that MMFs can play a role in ﬁlament evo-
lution and eruption. Deng et al. (2002) discovered

the active region complex. From east to west the ARs are: 11227, 11233 and 11226 outlined by the white
boxes. The LoS magnetic ﬁeld from HMI is shown in blue (yellow) contours representing positive (negative)
polarities corresponding to levels of ±300 G respectively. The image shows that ﬁlaments have formed along
PILs within the ARs and between ARs.

that the activation and ejection of plasma “blobs”
into a ﬁlament was a result of MMF cancellation
involving features ∼1019 Mx.

From June 1 to 4 there is a large addition of
magnetic ﬂux (∼ 7 × 1020 Mx up to 1.4 × 1021 Mx)
due to an emerging bipole located in the southern
part of the AR (EB; Figure 2 (b) & (c)). This
bipole has the same magnetic orientation as AR
11226, which is of Hale orientation.

Two further episodes of ﬂux emergence are seen
to begin on June 4 22:00 UT and June 5 06:00 UT
with an anti-Hale orientation (AH; Figure 2 (e)
& (f)). The bipoles emerge to the north and
south of the stationary positive spot, respectively.
The positive polarity of the second anti-Hale ﬂux
emergence is calculated, using the DPD catalogue,
to have a velocity of 0.36 km s−1 in the south-
eastward direction towards the PIL over a 13-hour
period, mimicking the motion of spot S.

Strong cancellation is observed along the inter-
nal PIL, the orientation of which becomes increas-
ingly tilted away from its initial N-S orientation
with time as shown by the blue dashed line in Fig-
ure 2 (a) & (f).

The unusual sunspot motions eventually cause
the dispersed negative (following) polarity to be-
come compressed as the process of cancellation re-
connection is presumably not fast enough to re-
move the negative ﬂux, causing a pile up at the
south eastern end of the PIL. This is made appar-

ent by the formation of strong ﬁeld region (Fig-
ure 2 (e) & (f), labelled OP). When viewed in the
HMI continuum, the compression of the negative
ﬁeld is associated with the formation of an orphan
penumbra, which later forms small spots at its pe-
riphery.

3.3. Vector Field Evolution

The evolution of the vector magnetic ﬁeld has
been studied during the same time period as the
LoS ﬁeld (2011 June 1 at 00:00 UT until June 6
06:00 UT). The top row of panels in Figure 4
show the evolution of the vector magnetic ﬁeld at
the southern end of the ﬁlament when the large
sunspot S has collided with the negative polarity
ﬂux concentrations. As a result, opposite-polarity
magnetic ﬂux accumulates at the PIL and can-
cellation proceeds. During this time the trans-
verse component of the vector ﬁeld evolves to more
strongly and coherently cross the PIL in the in-
verse direction (i.e. from negative to positive) at
numerous locations below the ﬁlament. This is
interpreted as observational evidence of the pres-
ence of bald patches (BPs), i.e. of locations where
the magnetic ﬁeld is horizontal and forming a dip
above the polarity inversion line where material
can be sustained against gravity. The BP loca-
tions have been directly computed from the vec-
tor magnetogram data using Eq. 3 in Titov et al.
(1993). Figure 4 shows the location of the BPs at

that merge together to form one ﬁlament along the PIL. Dense ﬁlament threads that build into the ﬁlament
during its evolution and extend the ﬁlament in length towards the south east are indicated by the arrow in

four diﬀerent times, indicating a coherent evolu-
tion of dips in time. Such a coherence is observed
consistently in large sections along the PIL during
the latter stages of the magnetic ﬁeld evolution
(from June 4 to June 6). Hence, it reduces drasti-
cally the possibility that the computed BPs are
the random eﬀect of an erroneous resolution of
the 180-degree ambiguity. The concave-up mag-
netic ﬁeld as deduced by the BP observations can
in principle be produced by either the presence of
a weakly twisted ﬂux rope, or by the presence of
an S-shaped PIL, see e.g. Fig. 2 of Titov et al.
(1993). In this case we have a PIL which is simple
in shape: a C-shaped rather than an S-shaped PIL
and so we interpret this as the presence of helical
ﬁeld in the form of a weakly twisted ﬂux rope.

3.4. Penumbra Formation

Penumbra formation is characterised by the
development of ﬁlamentary structures around a
sunspot and is considered to indicate the presence
of magnetic ﬁeld that is close to horizontal. These
structures form around pores above a certain di-

ameter or magnetic ﬂux content and are partial at
ﬁrst, appearing on the exterior of the spot away
from the site of ﬂux emergence. During the evolu-
tion of AR 11226 there are two signiﬁcant episodes
of unusual penumbra formation observed in the
HMI continuum data. Firstly, there is the forma-
tion of partial penumbra in the negative polarity
of the emerging bipole (EB) towards the interior of
the bipole. This conﬁguration is opposite to what
is expected and is due to the bipole emerging in
the vicinity of the negative polarity of AR 11226.
Secondly, an orphan penumbra forms in the lo-
cation of negative polarity magnetic ﬁeld, as men-
tioned above. The formation begins on June 5
around 23:00 UT when scattered penumbral areas
develop, some of which include small spots, and
some of which do not. The formation is appar-
ently driven by the motion of sunspot S, which
collides with and compresses the negative polar-
ity at this time (Figure 4). The orphan penumbra
threads are located parallel to the PIL, above the
negative polarity, directly to the east of spot S.
The orphan penumbra lies underneath the south-

8

ern end of the ﬁlament. As the ﬁlament grows (and
extends further to the south) the orphan penum-
bra reduces in size and starts to disappear around
June 6 06:00 UT. This occurs after the disappear-
ance of a transient brightening late on June 5.
These observations support the interpretation that
the magnetic ﬁeld is being reconﬁgured through
magnetic reconnection, which could be responsible
for injecting plasma into the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁg-
uration supporting the ﬁlament.

3.5. Flux Cancellation Rate

In order to determine the ﬂux cancellation rate
in AR 11226, the magnetic ﬂux from the bipole
that emerges in the southern part of the AR must
be taken into account, as this introduces addi-
tional magnetic ﬁeld to the region and masks the
true cancellation rate. Because of this, the ﬂux of
the emerging bipole was measured so that it could
be subtracted from the total AR ﬂux (which con-
tains both the pre-existing and emerging magnetic
ﬁeld). However, this becomes challenging, espe-
cially on June 3, when it is very hard to separate
the ﬂux of the emerging bipole from the surround-
ing AR magnetic ﬁeld. Due to this, the measured
magnetic ﬂux of the bipole was subtracted across
the ﬁrst three days (June 1 00:00 UT – June 3
15:00 UT) of the time interval over which the en-
tirety of the AR ﬂux is measured. For the remain-
der of the time range the ﬁnal ﬂux measurement
of the bipole was subtracted. The ﬂux evolution
of the AR, with that of the emerged bipole sub-
tracted, is shown in Figure 5. This revealed large
amounts of ﬂux cancellation in the region that was
viewed in the observations but originally masked
by ﬂux emergence in the ﬂux measurements.

After a slight initial increase in magnetic ﬂux,
there is roughly a 3.5 day period (2011 June 1
09:00 UT to 5 00:00 UT) when the unsigned ﬂux
of the AR is decreasing due to ongoing ﬂux can-
cellation. The majority of the ﬂux cancellation is
occurring at the internal PIL with an average ﬂux
cancellation rate of 2.0 × 1019 Mx hr−1. In total,
1.7 × 1021 Mx is cancelled during this time period.
The ﬂux in the AR at the start of the period stud-
ied is 8.2 × 1021 Mx and so the amount of ﬂux
cancelled represents 21% of the AR ﬂux. Follow-
ing the approach of van Ballegooijen & Martens
(1989) and Green et al. (2011), an amount of ﬂux
equal to that cancelled is available to be built into

the magnetic conﬁguration that contains the ﬁla-
ment material.

In contrast, the ﬂux evolution of the two neigh-
bouring ARs 11227 and 11233 (Figures 6 & 7)
show lower ﬂux cancellation rates. Hence, they
have lower ﬂux cancellation values over the time
period studied: AR 11227 loses 1.0 × 1021 Mx
of ﬂux, which represents 30% of the peak value
during the study period, and AR 11233 loses
1.2 × 1021 Mx of ﬂux, which is 54% of the maxi-
mum value (as shown in Table 1). Most of the ﬂux
cancellation in AR 11226 occurs along the internal
PIL; by contrast, the other regions display cancel-
lation mainly at their peripheries, therefore build-
ing ﬁlaments between adjacent ARs (Figure 1).

The total photospheric magnetic ﬂux of AR
11226 can be interpreted as having two main
phases of evolution. There is a period of ongoing
ﬂux cancellation at the internal PIL due to the
polarities being “butted up” against each other
that is aided by the motion of spot S, bringing
signiﬁcant quantities of positive ﬂux to the PIL.
During this period, the two ﬁlament sections ob-
served in the AIA 193 ˚A merge into one. Sunspot S
then becomes stationary when it reaches the nega-
tive polarity. In this phase, the orphan penumbra
and new “ﬁlament threads” are observed. These
threads build into the main ﬁlament, extending
its southern end. Since we observe brightenings in
the threads, it is interpreted that the facilitating
process is magnetic reconnection. However, it is
during this phase that two anti-Hale bipoles are
seen to emerge in the vicinity of the stationary
leading spot, masking ﬂux cancellation during the
second phase. The ﬂux in the anti-Hale bipoles is
not removed from the ﬂux evolution plot of AR
11226 because of the diﬃculties in distinguishing
it from the background ﬁeld of the AR.

4. Discussion

4.1. Photospheric Motions & Global Field

Structure of AR 11226

The splitting of the positive spot in AR 11226,
and the rapid motion of the sections that break
away, is highly unusual and rarely observed. This
complex and dynamic nature of the magnetic ﬁeld
indicates that the ﬂux tubes from which the AR
forms may have diﬀering sub-surface conﬁgura-
tions. One of the possibilities is that a U-loop

The arrows on the 304 ˚A images show the presence and locations of ﬁlamentary threads (black) and the

This causes the ﬁlament to grow and its footpoint to extend southwards. Movies of the HMI vector magnetic

loop originating from the toroidal ﬁeld at the base
of the convection zone. The other two ARs in the
three-region complex and the bipole that emerges
at the southern edge of AR 11226 also have a Hale
orientation.

The two bipoles that emerge later in the evo-
lution of AR 11226 on June 5 and 6 have an
anti-Hale orientation (AH in Figure 2), possibly
produced as a result of sub-surface vortices or
the kink instability acting on the sub-photospheric
ﬂux tube (Lopez Fuentes et al. 2003). We specu-
late that even the splitting of the positive leading
spot on May 31, and the subsequent fast motion
of spot S (Figure 2) towards the PIL, is also due
to the emergence of an anti-Hale orientated ﬂux
tube and its sub-surface interaction with the pre-
existing Hale-orientated ﬂux system. This is anal-
ogous to the ﬂux emergence and sub-surface can-
cellation example described by Wang & Shi (1993).
In both cases, the new ﬂux emergence takes place
in strong monopolar ﬁeld. Sub-surface reconnec-
tion prevents the oppositely orientated polarity
from being observed.
In this case, the negative
polarity of the anti-Hale bipole remains mostly
hidden below the photosphere. The reorganisa-
tion only reconnects part of the positive spot’s
magnetic ﬁeld to the buoyant emerging ﬂux. The
sub-surface connections of the part which becomes
spot S change, and this reconﬁguration causes the
splitting and motion of this section of the positive

polarity, whilst the rest remains stationary. The
spot moves south-eastward towards the PIL as the
emerging anti-Hale ﬂux tube’s consecutive cross-
sections with the photosphere are shifting south-
eastward.

In this AR we interpret the ongoing ﬂux can-
cellation along the PIL, and associated magnetic
reconnection, to lead to the formation of two mag-
netic ﬂux systems. A small loop that cannot al-
ways be resolved against the surrounding AR ﬁeld
and which submerges through the photosphere
(observed as a reduction in magnetic ﬂux) and a
concave-up section of ﬁeld (BP locations), which is
observed as an inverse crossing of the PIL at the
photosphere. This interpretation along with the
combined observations of the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld, EUV emission and absorption struc-
tures are well aligned to the evolutionary sequence
of ﬁlament and ﬂux rope formation as laid out in
van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989).

The alternative explanation of the BPs present
along the PIL as a dipped arcade-like ﬁeld lines
touching over an S-shaped PIL is diﬃcult to con-
struct in our case without invoking helical ﬁeld.
The problem lies in the fact that, in this case, we
do not have an S-shaped PIL as in Titov et al.
(1993), but rather a simple C-shaped PIL. Hence,
such a dipped-arcade like ﬁeld line should, for
example, start from the positive polarity in the
northern part of the magnetogram, pass above the
PIL, turn and touch the PIL with an inverse cross-
ing, then again turn back and cross high up over
the PIL to ﬁnally be rooted in the negative po-
larity. Such a ﬁeld line, if not helical, would be
highly non-force-free, which is diﬃcult to justify
in the corona. Furthermore, there is no indica-
tion of the presence of such ﬁeld lines in Figure 4.
From the evidence outlined above, we are there-
fore compelled to infer the presence of a weakly
twisted ﬂux rope as the single magnetic struc-
ture that can explain several observations. More-
over, the subsequent eruption was modelled by van
Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2014) using a ﬂux rope lo-
cated at the same position of the observed ﬁla-
ment. The numerical simulation of the magneto-
hydrodynamical evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld
was shown to capture many of the essential fea-
tures of the observed eruption, to a very high de-
gree of accuracy, in this way corroborating our hy-
pothesis of ﬂux rope formation.

As the breakaway spot S moves towards the PIL
and compresses the pre-existing ﬁeld in the ﬁla-
ment channel, an orphan penumbra forms. Pre-
vious formation mechanisms of penumbrae have
included their formation as the result of a ﬂux
rope trapped in the photosphere (Kuckein et al.
2012a,b), the emergence of an Ω-loop trapped by
canopy ﬁelds (Lim et al. 2013; Zuccarello et al.
2014) or submerging horizontal ﬁelds (Jurˇc´ak et al.
2014). Observational evidence in this study sug-
gests the existence of a low-lying ﬂux rope (and
ﬁlament) with highly sheared horizontal ﬁeld at
the PIL. However, in this case there is no emer-
gence of magnetic ﬂux in the region forming the
orphan penumbra during this period (∼June 4–6),
which suggests that the compression of the nega-
tive magnetic ﬁeld is responsible.

Filament threads that consist of relatively cool
plasma are seen to form in 304 ˚A data (Figure 4),
connecting spot S and the negative polarity of
the newly emerging anti-Hale bipole. This allows
plasma to be injected into the ﬁlament through
magnetic reconnection, which is evident through
transient brightenings. Previous observations by
Zhang et al. (2014) have described this “ﬂux-
feeding” process where chromospheric ﬁbrils feed
ﬂux into the ﬁlament eventually leading it to be-
come unstable to the torus instability. Wang &
Murlach (2013) observed large brightenings in the
regions where ﬂux cancellation is occurring along
the ﬁlament channel and suggest that the asso-
ciated loop systems go on to form part of the
ﬁlament channel. Another study by Liu et al.
(2012) has found similar evidence whereby ﬂux is
transferred from a lower to an upper branch in
a “double-decker” ﬁlament conﬁguration. During
this phase the absorption and extent of the ﬁla-
ment increases, which is interpreted as mass be-
ing transferred into the ﬁlament (known as “mass
loading”). This occurs in the evolutionary phase
of the ﬁlament when it is close to eruption. This
process of mass accumulation may force the hor-
izontal ﬁeld to a lower height, raising the possi-
bility that magnetic reconnection associated with
ﬂux cancellation is occurring very low in the pho-
tosphere.

4.2. Flux Cancellation

The average ﬂux cancellation rate along the
PIL where the ﬁlament is located in AR 11226 is

12

2.0 × 1019 Mx hr−1. In total, 1.7 × 1021 Mx is can-
celled during the time period studied. This rate
exceeds that found in most of the previous studies
(see Table 1). Vemareddy & Zhang (2014) records
a higher value, but this is omitted from Table 1 as
the size of the region in that work is comparable
to the entire June 7 three AR complex with multi-
ple PILs. Sterling et al. (2010) also record a higher
cancellation rate (4.2×1019 Mx hr−1) compared to
what we ﬁnd for AR 11226 (2.0 × 1019 Mx hr−1),
but over a shorter time period of one day. AR
11226 exhibits the largest amount of ﬂux cancel-
lation yet studied, over the longest period of time.
The data produced by the HMI instrument are
of high quality, however there are known uncer-
tainties, limitations and systematic errors present
that aﬀect the measurement of magnetic ﬂux.
These include a sinusoidal variation in the to-
tal magnetic ﬂux with a periodicity of 12 and 24
hours, due to a Doppler shift present in the Fe
spectral line (Hoeksema et al. 2014). The main
contribution to this shift is the geosynchronous
orbit of SDO. The ±3 km s-1 daily variation in
spacecraft orbital velocity causes a sinusoidal vari-
ation in the total ﬂux measured. This aﬀects weak
and strong magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the LoS
magnetograms diﬀerently, with the daily variation
remaining below 30 G for ﬁeld strengths below
1000 G and less than 75 G for ﬁeld strengths below
2250 G. On average during a day this is roughly
± 35 G (Coudivdat et al. 2015). Nevertheless, the
strength of these instrumental and observational
eﬀects do not account for the strong ﬂux cancel-
lation we observe in AR 11226 prior to eruption.
The leading edge of the positive polarity of AR
11226 reaches ∼60◦ from central meridian on June
6. Due to the spatially dependent sensitivity of
HMI the noise level increases as a function of the
centre-to-limb angle and the spacecraft’s orbital
velocity. This increases the value of low and mod-
erate ﬁeld pixel values (between 250–750 G) by a
few tens of percent and manifests itself as broad
peaks that are centred at ∼ ±60◦ in the magnetic
ﬂux. This could be responsible for the increase in
ﬂux seen in Figure 5 at this time. Although, the
increase also coincides with the emergence of the
two anti-Hale bipoles and so it is diﬃcult to disen-
tangle these eﬀects. The proximity of AR 11226 to
the limb on June 6 means that the magnetic ﬂux
was not measured right up until the time of the

eruption but ceased approximately a day before-
hand. Therefore, these results are a lower limit
of the total ﬂux cancelled in the lead up to the
eruption. Furthermore, due to the fact cancella-
tion persists for several days, we can extrapolate
that if the cancellation process continues at the
same rate (2.0 × 1019 Mx hr−1) as we observed in
the period of June 1 09:00 UT to June 5 00:00 UT
up until eruption, an extra 1.1 × 1021 Mx could
have been cancelled. This would therefore result
in a total amount of 2.8 × 1021 Mx ﬂux cancelled
between two consecutive CMEs.

5. Conclusions

This work studies the formation of the ex-
ceptionally massive ﬁlament in AR 11226, which
erupted on 2011 June 7 at ∼06:15 UT. We suggest
that magnetic reconnection associated with strong
ﬂux cancellation was responsible for the formation
of the ﬁlament and the injection of plasma into
a forming ﬂux rope. This was evident from the
following photospheric and chromospheric signa-
tures:

• The presence and coherent appearance of
bald patches in the transverse magnetic
ﬁeld component along the PIL. This is in-
terpreted as the observational evidence of
concave-up magnetic ﬁeld geometry or mag-
netic dips in the presence of a weakly twisted
ﬂux rope.

• A high ﬂux cancellation rate (2.0×1019 Mx hr−1),
which is driven by the motion of the spot S
towards the PIL.

• The formation of an orphan penumbra and
small spots as the dispersed negative mag-
netic ﬁeld is compressed by the positive-
polarity spot S reaching the PIL. We suggest
that the process of cancellation reconnection
is not fast enough causing a pile up of neg-
ative ﬂux at the south eastern end of the
ﬁlament and PIL.

• The south eastern end of the forming ﬁla-
ment is observed to be rooted in the loca-
tion of the orphan penumbra. The penum-
bral threads lie parallel to the PIL. In the
chromosphere in the same region we observe
highly sheared ﬁlamentary threads. These

that between 1.7 × 1021 Mx and 2.0 × 1021 Mx
of ﬂux is in the rope when the ﬁlament eruption

around a factor of three higher than the ﬂux ropes
modelled by Savcheva et al. (2012) which were
formed in small and decaying bipolar ARs. This
is 34 % of the maximum AR ﬂux (8.2 × 1021 Mx)
that the AR contained at the start of the study.
It is only at this point, when the ratio of the ﬂux
contained in the rope to the ﬂux of the overlying
arcade ﬁeld is potentially 1:0.9, that the rope with
its huge quantity of ﬁlament mass, can ﬁnally no
longer be held down by the overlying arcade ﬁeld.
This would explain the development of the unusu-
ally massive ﬁlament and spectacular eruption of
June 7.

dense threads are reconﬁgured through the
process of magnetic reconnection, extending
the ﬁlament towards the south east and pos-
sibly injecting plasma into the ﬁlament.

The ﬂux cancellation that occurred in the three
ARs was computed by applying the STEF algo-
rithm to calculate the reduction in unsigned mag-
netic ﬂux, roughly over a 3.5 day period (June 1
09:00 UT – 5 00:00 UT). In AR 11226 1.7 × 1021
Mx (21% of the maximum AR ﬂux), equivalent
to a small AR is cancelled up to a day before the
eruption. This corresponds to a large cancella-
tion rate of 2.0 × 1019 Mx hr−1 over a prolonged
period, among one of the largest rates of cancel-
lation of any previous studies to date. Assuming
that this cancellation rate continued through the
time period when HMI data cannot be used, due
to instrumental and observational eﬀects close to
the limb, leads to an estimated 2.8 × 1021 Mx of
ﬂux cancelled prior to the large ﬁlament eruption
and CME on 2011 June 7.

The majority of the ﬂux cancellation in AR
11226 occurred at the internal PIL, at the loca-
tion where the ﬁlament formed. Whereas, for
the neighbouring ARs the cancellation occurred at
both the internal and external PILs, hence form-
ing inter-active region ﬁlaments. The amount of
ﬂux cancelled along the internal PIL in AR 11226
is substantially more than the cancelled ﬂux of the
neighbouring regions during the same period; AR
11227 (1.0 × 1021 Mx) and 11233 (1.2 × 1021 Mx).
The ﬂux cancellation along the internal PIL of
AR 11226 can be used to investigate the amount
of ﬂux that was built into the ﬂux rope that
was identiﬁed using the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld
data. However, the amount of ﬂux cancellation ob-
served may diﬀer from the amount of ﬂux that is
built into the rope. By modelling weakly twisted
ﬂux ropes and validating against observations,
Savcheva et al. (2012) found that their modelled
ﬂux ropes contain around 60 to 70% of the ﬂux
that is cancelled in the region in which the ropes
form. Applying this conclusion to AR 11226, we
infer that a substantial amount of ﬂux was built
into the ﬂux rope that contained and supported
the ﬁlament. Using the estimated value of the
amount of ﬂux cancelled in AR 11226 from the
start of the study up to the point of eruption (both
the quantity observed and the estimated quantity
