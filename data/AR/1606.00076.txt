TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS VIA
DYNKIN DIAGRAM AUTOMORPHISMS: I

SE-JIN OH†, UHI RINN SUH‡

Abstract. We introduce and study the twisted adapted r-cluster point and its combina-
torial Auslander-Reiten quivers, called twisted AR-quivers and folded AR-quivers, of type
A2n+1 which are closely related to twisted Coxeter elements and associated with the non-
trivial Dynkin diagram automorphism. As applications of the study, we prove that any
folded AR-quiver of type A2n+1 and hence the twisted adapted r-cluster point encode cru-
cial information on the representation theory of quantum aﬃne algebra U ′
n+1) such as
Dorey’s rule and denominator formulas.

Introduction

Let Q be a Dynkin quiver of ﬁnite type ADE. By the Gabriel theorem [10], it is well-
known that the information on the representation theory for the path algebra CQ is encoded
in its Auslander-Reiten quiver ΓQ. More precisely, each vertex in ΓQ corresponds to an inde-
composable module over CQ and each arrow in ΓQ corresponds to an irreducible morphism.
Interestingly, (i) the set of all vertices in ΓQ can be identiﬁed with the set Φ+ of positive
roots of ﬁnite type ADE via dimension vectors, (ii) the paths in ΓQ represent the convex
partial order ≺Q on Φ+, (iii) ΓQ has a canonical coordinate system. It is also well-known
that ΓQ satisﬁes additive property and ΓQ can be constructed by using its unique Coxeter
element φQ.

On the other hand, for each commutation class [

w0] of reduced expressions of the longest
element w0 for a Weyl group W of ﬁnite type, there exists a convex partial order ≺[ ew0] on Φ+.
In particular, (i) ≺Q corresponds to the commutation class [Q] of w0 which is adapted to the
Dynkin quiver Q of ﬁnite type ADE and (ii) all commutations classes [Q] can be grouped into
one r-cluster point [[Q]] via reﬂection equivalence relations arising from reﬂection functor. In
w0] of w0 for
[26], the authors introduced the combinatorial AR-quiver Υ[ ew0] for every class [
any ﬁnite type and its combinatorial properties as a realization of ≺[ ew0]. The construction of
Υ[ ew0] was given in an inductive way and Υ[ ew0] does not have a coordinate system in general.
In the representation theory of quantum aﬃne algebras, Coxeter elements and their AR-
quivers appear in interesting ways. More precisely, (1) Chari-Pressley [6] determined the

For type A(1)

twisted Coxeter elements. (The Dorey’s rules for A(2)

With newly introduced notions in [25], the ﬁrst named author proved that we can read the
denominator formulas dk,l(z) for U ′

ADn, which control their representation theory (see [14, Theorem 2.2.1]). (3) In [23, 24], he
also proved that Dorey’s rule for U ′
n ) (t = 1, 2) can be interpreted as the
coordinates of (α, β, γ) in some ΓQ where (α, β) is a pair for γ = α + β ∈ Φ+. Furthermore,
every pair (α, β) of γ is [Q]-minimal when Q is of type A.

The goal of this paper is to make analogue of the diagram (0.1) by using twisted Coxeter
elements of ﬁnite type A2n+1, as Chari-Pressley used them to investigate Dorey’s rule for
q(B(1)
U ′
n+1). Here, the twisted Coxeter elements can be understood as a generalization of
Coxeter elements via the non-trivial Dynkin diagram automorphism ∨. Note that the orbit
of the automorphism yields the Dynkin diagram of type Bn+1 (see Deﬁnition 2.2):

The various approaches to study on non-simply laced type via Dynkin diagram folding
were well-developed in many contexts (for examples, see [7, 8, 11, 13]). In this paper, we do
not study on the ﬁnite type Bn+1 whose Dynkin diagram is an orbit of the Dynkin diagram
A2n+1 via the automorphism. We do study certain family of reduced expressions of the longest
element of Weyl group of the same type A2n+1, which is characterizable and related to the
representation theory of quantum aﬃne algebra of type B(1)
n+1, by folding its combinatorial
AR-quivers via the automorphism ∨.

We ﬁrst construct and characterize the cluster point [[Q♦]] of w0 arising from any twisted
Coxeter elements φ[i 0]∨ of ﬁnite type A2n+1 (Deﬁnition 1.11). The cluster point [[Q♦]] can be
distinguished from [[Q]] via their ∨-Coxeter compositions (Deﬁnition 1.8):

(see Example 1.10 also). The cluster point [[Q♦]] called the twisted adapted cluster point
and its commutation classes are said to be twisted adapted (Deﬁnition 4.2). Surprisingly,
the point [[Q♦]] of type A2n+1 is closely related to the point [[Q]] of type A2n and each
commutation class [i 0] in [[Q♦]] can be obtained from some class [Q] in [[Q]] by performing a
special surgery (Theorem 4.17). Thus, for [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]], Υ[i 0] has a natural coordinate system
and its construction is not inductive anymore. The surgery can be described as the way of
obtaining Υ[Q<] and Υ[Q>] from ΓQ by inserting new vertices in each direction:

Moreover, we can conclude that the number of distinct classes in [[Q♦]] as 22n via the two to
one and onto map P : [[Q♦]] → [[Q]] (Theorem 4.12).

Secondly, we study the combinatorial properties of Υ[i 0] ([i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]]), called a twisted
AR-quiver, by using ΓQ for P([i 0]) = [Q] and applying notions in [25]. More precisely, we
suggest the ways how to label the vertices of Υ[i 0] in an eﬃcient way (Theorem 5.14) and
how to assign a coordinate to each vertex, by using the combinatorial properties of ΓQ and
the surgery (Algorithm 5.1). As applications, we prove the twisted additive property for Υ[i 0]
(Theorem 6.3 and Proposition 7.7), observe the interesting properties of Φ+ with respect to
≺[i 0] (Section 6.3) and characterize each [i0]-minimal pair (α, β) of γ in terms of coordinates
in Υ[i 0] (Section 6.4).

In the last part, we introduce new quiver

set of simple reﬂections {si | i ∈ In} associated to ∆n and nw0 be the longest element of Wn.
We usually drop n if there is no danger of confusion. Now we recall the non-trivial Dynkin

Note that ∨(n,s) is not necessarily same as ∗(n) of I induced by the longest element w0. For
example, if n is even then ∗(n) for type Dn is the identity so that it is not the same as ∨(n,s)
in (1.2). Also, (1.4) is not an involution. Usually we abbreviate (n,s) to (n) or skip if there is
no danger of confusion.

Recall the Weyl group W is a group generated by {si | i ∈ I} subject to the following

relations:

(1) s2

i = 1

(2) (sisj)dij +2 = 1,

where dij = dji (i, j ∈ I) denotes the number of arrows between the vertices i and j in ∆.
The relations (2) are so-called braid relations. When dij = dji = 0, they are simply named
commutation relations.

Let hIi be the free monoid generated by I and hIir be the set of reduced words of hIi in the
sense of Weyl group representation. We usually denote by i for words and by i for reduced
words.

Deﬁnition 1.1. For a word i and J ⊂ I, we deﬁne a subword i|J of i = i1 · · · il as follows:

i|J := it1 · · · its such that

Deﬁnition 1.2.

itx ∈ J and tx < ty for all 1 ≤ x < y < s,

(cid:26)

(1) We say that two reduced words i and j representing w ∈ W are commutation equiv-
alent, denoted by i ∼ j ∈ [i ], if i is obtained from j by applying only commutation
relations.

(2) We say that an element w ∈ W is fully commutative if the number of commutation
classes for w is the same as 1. Thus we denote its unique commutation class by [w].

Deﬁnition 1.3. Fix a Dynkin diagram ∆ of ﬁnite type. For a commutation class [i 0]
representing w0, we say that an index i is a sink (resp. source) of [i0] if there is a reduced
word j 0 ∈ [i 0] of w0 starting with i (resp. ending with i).

The following proposition may be known for experts on the research area but it is hard
to ﬁnd the same statement. In [26], the authors proved the following proposition by using
positive root systems and convex total orders induced from reduced words for w0.

Recall the involution ∗ on I induced by w0 ([5]).

Proposition 1.4. For the reduced word i0 = i1i2 · · · iN−1iN of w0, the word i′
is again a reduced word of w0 such that [i′

By applying the above proposition, we can obtain new reduced words for w0 by applying
the operations so called reﬂection functors in the Auslander-Reiten theory, from a reduced
word for w0.

Convention 1.9. If there is no danger of confusion, we identify the index set ¯I with the
set {1, 2, · · · , | ¯I|} ∈ Z by the correspondence ¯js 7→ s for ¯js in Deﬁnition 1.8. Hence the sum
(resp. subtraction) ¯js + ¯js′ (resp. ¯js − ¯js′) is considered as the sum (resp. subtraction) on Z
and, similarly, the sum (resp. subtraction) between the index ¯js and t for t ∈ Z is deﬁned by
that on Z.

2. Twisted Coxeter elements and induced reduced expressions
Convention 2.1. We can view W as a subgroup of GL(CΦ) generated by the set of simple
reﬂections {si | i ∈ I}. In this case, we use the term “reduced expression” instead of “reduced
word”. Moreover, we sometimes abuse the notation i to represent reduced expressions.

Let σ ∈ GL(CΦ) be a linear transformation of ﬁnite order which preserves some base Π of
Φ. Hence σ preserves Φ itself and normalizes W and so W acts by conjugation on the coset
W σ.

Deﬁnition 2.2.

(1) Let {Πi1, . . . , Πik} be the all orbits of Π in Φ with respect to σ. For each r ∈
{1, · · · , k}, choose αir ∈ Πir arbitrarily, and let sir ∈ W denote the corresponding
reﬂection. Let w be the product of si1, . . . , sik in any order. The element wσ ∈ W σ
thus obtained is called a σ-Coxeter element.

8

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

(2) If σ in (1) is ∨ in (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), then σ-Coxeter element is also called a twisted

Coxeter element.

(3) If σ in (1) is ∨ or ∨2 in (1.4) then σ-Coxeter element is also called a triply twisted

Coxeter element.

Example 2.3. Take σ as ∨ in (1.1) for A5. There are 12 distinct twisted Coxeter elements
in W ∨ given as follows:

s1s2s3∨, s2s1s3∨, s3s1s2∨, s3s2s1∨, s5s2s3∨, s3s2s5∨,
s1s4s3∨, s3s1s4∨, s5s4s3∨, s4s5s3∨, s3s5s4∨, s3s4s5 ∨ .

Example 2.4. Take σ as ∨ in (1.2) for D4:
There are 8 distinct twisted Coxeter elements in W ∨ given as follows:

s1s2s3∨, s1s3s2∨, s2s1s3∨, s3s2s1∨,
s1s2s4∨, s1s4s2∨, s2s1s4∨, s4s2s1 ∨ .

Remark 2.5. Note that w in (1) of Deﬁnition 2.2 is fully commutative of length |I|. Thus,
for ir contained in the orbit of an extremal vertex of ∆, sir is a sink or a source of [w].

In the proof of the following proposition, we shall use the notion of Coxeter elements and

their properties will be reviewed in Subsection 3.1:

Proposition 2.6.

(1) The number of twisted Coxeter elements associated to (1.1) is 4 × 3n−1.
(2) The number of twisted Coxeter elements associated to (1.2) is 2n.
(3) The number of twisted Coxeter elements associated to (1.3) is 24.
(4) The number of triply twisted Coxeter elements associated to (1.4) is 12.

Proof. (1) For A3 type, there are four twisted Coxeter elements s1s2∨ = [1 2]∨, s2s1∨ =
[2 1]∨, s3s2∨ = [3 2]∨, s2s3∨ = [2 3]∨.

Assume that our assertion is true for type A2n−1. Take a twisted Coxeter element

Let J = {2, 3, · · · , 2n} ⊂ I2n+1. We shall ﬁnd twisted Coxeter element i ∨ of A2n+1 satisfying

[i1 i2 · · · in] ∨ of type A2n−1.

(a) Assume that there is t ∈ {1, · · · , n} such that i+

not have the index 2n. Then [i ] can be three of following classes:

[1 i |J ],

[i |J 1],

[2n + 1 i |J ].

Here we use the property that s1si+

(b) Assume that there is t ∈ {1, · · · , n} such that i+

not have the index 2. Then [i ] can be three of following classes:

[2n + 1 i |J],

Here we use the property that s2n+1si+

Hence we can get three distinct twisted Coxeter elements of type A2n+1 induced from a
twisted Coxeter element of type A2n−1. Therefore the number of twisted Coxeter elements of
type A2n+1 is 4 × 3n−1 by Remark 2.5.
(2) There exists a canonical one-to-one correspondence between Coxeter elements of type An
and twisted Coxeter elements of Dn+1 with sn deﬁned by

si1si2 · · · sin ↔ si1si2 · · · sin ∨ .

On the other hand, there is the one-to-one correspondence between twisted Coxeter elements
of Dn+1 with sn and twisted Coxeter elements of Dn+1 with sn+1 deﬁned by

si1si2 · · · sin∨ ↔ si′

s6s5s4s3∨, s6s4s5s3∨, s6s3s5s4∨, s6s3s4s5∨, s6s1s4s3∨, s6s3s4s1∨, s6s5s2s3∨, s6s3s5s1∨,

(4) We list all the triply twisted Coxeter elements of D4 for (1.4):

s1s4∨, s2s4∨, s3s4∨, s4s1∨, s4s2∨, s4s3∨
s1s4∨2, s2s4∨2, s3s4∨2, s4s1∨2, s4s2∨2, s4s3 ∨2 .

3. Adapted cluster point of type ADE, convex orders and (combinatorial)

Auslander-Reiten quiver

In this section, we shortly review the theories on the reduced expressions of w0 which are
adapted to some Dynkin quiver Q, convex orders on the set of positive roots of ﬁnite types
and (combinatorial) Auslander-Reiten quivers. For the precise reference, we mainly refer
[2, 3, 10, 23, 25, 26].

10

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

3.1. Adapted cluster point of type ADE. In this subsection, we consider the case when
the Dynkin diagram ∆ is simply laced; that is, ∆ is of type ADEn.

A Dynkin quiver Q is obtained by orienting all edges of ∆. We denote by Φ+ the set
of all positive roots and Π = {αi | i ∈ I } the set of simple roots associated to ∆. The
Gabriel theorem states that there exists a bijection between (i) the set of isomorphism classes
of indecomposable modules IndQ in the ﬁnite dimensional module category over the path
algebra CQ and (ii) Φ+, via taking dimension vectors on IndQ ([10]).

We say that a vertex is a sink (resp. source) of Q if and only if there are only entering
arrows into (resp. exiting arrows out of) it. Let i be a sink or a source of Q. We denote by
i Q the quiver obtained from Q by reversing the orientation of each arrow incident with i in
Q. For a reduced word i , we say that i = i1i2 · · · il is adapted to Q if

ik is a sink of ik−1 · · · i2i1 Q for all 1 ≤ k ≤ l.

The followings are well-known and we record here for later use:

Theorem 3.1.

(1) A reduced word i0 of w0 is adapted at most one Dynkin quiver Q.
(2) For each Dynkin quiver Q, there is a reduced word i0 of w0 adapted to Q.
(3) Reduced expressions i0 and i′

0 are adapted to Q if and only if i0 ∼ i′

to Q. Hence the commutation class [Q] of w0 adapted to Q is well-deﬁned.

0 and i0 is adapted

(4) For every commutation class [Q], there exists a unique Coxeter element φQ. We
have (i) φQ is a product of all simple reﬂections, (ii) φQ is fully commutative, (iii)
φQ · Q = Q, (iv) φQ is adapted to Q.

(5) For every Coxeter element φ, there exists a unique Dynkin quiver Q such that φ = φQ.

Furthermore, all commutation classes in {[Q]} are reﬂective equivalent via re-
ﬂection functors and form an r-cluster point [[Q]]. Since there are 2|I|−1-many
Dynkin quivers, the number of commutation classes inside of [[Q]] and of Coxeter
elements are the same as 2|I|−1. More precisely, we have one-to-one correspon-
dences

(3.1)

between order 2|I|−1 sets and call [[Q]] the adapted cluster point.

3.2. Convex orders on Φ+. Recall that W acts on the set of all roots Φ. For w ∈ W ,
consider the subset Φ(w) of Φ deﬁned as follows:

(3.2)

Φ(w) := {β ∈ Φ+ | w−1(β) ∈ Φ−}.

Lemma 3.2. [5] For w ∈ W , the followings hold:

(1) Φ(w) = {si1si2 · · · sik−1(αik) | k = 1, . . . , l} for any reduced word i = i1i2 · · · il of w.
(2) |Φ(w)| = ℓ(w) and hence Φ(w0) = Φ+.

In this paper, we mainly focus on when w = w0. By the above lemma, we can deﬁne a

total order <i 0 on Φ+ depending on i 0 = i1i2 · · · iN of w0 as follows:
k <i 0 βi 0
βi 0

βi 0
k := si1si2 · · · sik−1(αik ) (1 ≤ k ≤ N)
Interestingly, the order <i 0 is convex in the following sense.

and

l ⇐⇒ k < l.

Deﬁnition 3.3. We say that an order ≺ on Φ+ is convex if it satisﬁes the following property:
For α, β ∈ Φ+ satisfying α + β ∈ Φ+, we have either

α ≺ α + β ≺ β

or

β ≺ α + β ≺ α.

By considering <i ′
on [i 0]: For α, β ∈ Φ+,

0 for all i ′

0 ∈ [i 0], we can construct a partial order ≺[i 0] depending only

(3.3)

α ≺[i 0] β

if α <i ′

0

β for all i ′

0 ∈ [i 0].

The order ≺[i 0] is well-deﬁned and also convex due to the following observation: For reduced
expressions i 0 ∼ i ′

0 and any pair (α, β) such that α + β ∈ Φ+, we have

α <i 0 α + β <i 0 β if and only if α <i ′

0 α + β <i ′

0 β.

3.3. (Combinatorial) Auslander-Reiten quivers.

Deﬁnition 3.4. For a Dynkin quiver Q of ﬁnite type ADE, let us choose any reduced word
i 0 in [Q]. The quiver ΓQ = (Γ0

Q) is called the Auslander-Reiten quiver (AR-quiver) if

Q, Γ1

(1) each vertex in Γ0
(2) an arrow [M] → [M ′] in Γ1

Q corresponds to an isomorphism class [M] in IndQ,

Q represents an irreducible morphism M → M ′.

By the Gabriel theorem [10], we can replace the vertex set IndQ of ΓQ with Φ+. On the
other hand, we can construct the AR-quiver ΓQ in a purely combinatorial way by using only
its Coxeter element φQ.

(A) As we observed in (3.2), Φ(φQ) is well-deﬁned for the Coxeter element φQ = si1si2 · · · sin:
2 = si1(αi1), . . . , βφQ

n = si1 · · · sin−1(αin)}.

Φ(φQ) = {βφQ

1 = αi1, βφQ

Furthermore, the residue ik on βφQ
reduced word for φQ. (Recall that φQ is fully commutative.)

k

is also well-deﬁned and does not depend on the choice of

(B) The height function ξ associated to Q is a map on Q satisfying ξ(j) = ξ(i) + 1 if there
exists an arrow i → j in Q. Note that the connectedness of Q implies the uniqueness of ξ up
to constant. In this paper, we ﬁx ξ.

Hence we can assign βφQ
k

to (ik, ξ(ik)) ∈ I × Z which does depend only on Q and hence φQ:

Algorithm 3.5. The AR-quiver ΓQ, whose set of vertices is also identiﬁed with a subset of
I × Z, can be constructed by the following injective map ΩQ : Φ → I × Z in an inductive
way (cf. [12]) :
(1) ΩQ(βφQ

k ) := (ik, ξ(ik)).

12

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

(2) If ΩQ(β) is already assigned as (i, p) and φQ(β) ∈ Φ+, then

ΩQ(φQ(β)) = (i, p − aii) = (i, p − 2).

(3) For (i, p), (j, q) ∈ Im(ΩQ), there exists an arrow (i, p) → (j, q) if and only if i and j

are adjacent in ∆ and

p − q = aij = −1.

For β with ΩQ(β) = (i, p), we call i the residue of β with respect to [Q] and (i, p) is a
coordinate of β in ΓQ.

Also, the AR-quiver ΓQ has the following property.

Proposition 3.6. [4, 10, 29] Let us denote by h∨ the dual Coxeter number associated to Q.
For an index i ∈ I, let

h∨ + ai − bi
2
is the number of arrows in Q between i and i∗ directed toward i and bQ
i

where aQ
is the
i
number of arrows in Q between i and i∗ directed toward i∗. Then the number of vertex in
ΓQ ∩ {i} × Z is rQ

rQ
i =

i and

ΓQ ∩ {i} × Z = { (i, ξ(i) − 2k) | k = 0, · · · , ri − 1}.
The reﬂection functor ri : [Q] 7→ [Q]ri for a sink i of [Q] can be understood by the map

from ΓQ to ΓiQ described using coordinates and the dual Coxeter number h∨ as follows:
Algorithm 3.7. Let h∨ be the dual Coxeter number associated to Q.

(A1) Remove the vertex (i, p) such that ΩQ(αi) = (i, p) and the arrows entering into (i, p)

in ΓQ.

(A2) Add the vertex (i∗, p − h∨) and the arrows to all (j, p − h∨ + 1) for j adjacent to i∗ in

∆.

(A3) Label the vertex (i∗, p − h∨) with αi and change the labels β to si(β) for all β ∈

ΓQ \ {αi}.

For β ∈ Φ+ with φQ(β) ∈ Φ+, the AR-quiver ΓQ satisﬁes the additive property in the

following sense:

(3.4)

β + φQ(β) =

γ,

XΩQ(γ)=(j,p−1)

where ΩQ(β) = (i, p − 2) and j runs over all vertices with coordinates (j, p − 1) such that j
is adjacent with i in ∆.

Interestingly, ΓQ can be also understood as a visualization of ≺Q := ≺[Q] and is closely

related to [Q]:

Theorem 3.8. [4, 26, 28]

(1) α ≺Q β if and only if there exists a path from β to α inside of ΓQ.
(2) By reading residues of vertices in a way compatible with arrows, we can obtain all

reduced words i0 ∈ [Q].

commutation class [i 0] of any ﬁnite type. The quiver can be understood as a generalization
of ΓQ:

Theorem 3.11. [26] Let us choose any commutation class [i0] and a reduced word i0 in [i0].
(1) The construction of Υi0 does depend only on its commutation class [i0] and hence Υ[i0]

is well-deﬁned.

(2) α ≺[i0] β if and only if there exists a path from β to α in Υ[i0].
(3) By deﬁning the notion, standard tableaux of shape Υ[i0], every reduced word i′

0 ∈ [i0]
corresponds to a standard tableau of shape Υ[i0] and can be obtained by reading residues
in a way compatible with the tableau.

(4) When [i0] = [Q], Υ[Q] is isomorphic to ΓQ as quivers.

Example 3.12. Let i 0 = (123124123124) be a reduced word of w0 of type D4. Note that i 0
is not adapted to any Dynkin quiver of type D4. We can draw the combinatorial AR-quiver

4. Twisted adapted cluster point of type A2n+1

In this section, we shall introduce a special r-cluster point, say the twisted cluster point,
associated to the set of twisted Coxeter elements related to ∨ in (1.1). As we have seen in
Proposition 2.6, the number of all twisted Coxeter elements of W2n+1 related to ∨ in (1.1)
is the same as 4 × 3n−1 while the number of all Coxeter elements and hence the number of
distinct commutation classes in [[Q]] is the same as 22n. In this section, we show that the
number of distinct commutation classes in the twisted cluster point is also 22n even though
the number of twisted Coxeter elements is 4 × 3n−1.

Let us consider the following word i0 of W of the ﬁnite type A2n+1:

Deﬁnition 4.2.

(1) The r-cluster point [[Q♦]] := [[i 0]] is called the twisted adapted cluster point of type

A2n+1.
(2) A class [i ′

Consider the monoid homomorphism

such that

for i = 1, · · · , n and j = n + 2, · · · , 2n + 1.

i|J = i′

for any i′ ∈ [i].

In other words, any i′ ∈ [i] can be obtained from i by other commutation relations
than sisi+2 = si+2si.

Proposition 4.4.

(1) P(i0) = (1 2 3 · · · n 2n 2n − 1 · · · n + 1)n(1 2 3 · · · n) is a reduced word of the longest

element 2nw0 of A2n.

(2) For i′

0 ∈ [i0], we have [P(i′

0)] = [P(i0)].

Proof. (1) One can easily check that P(i 0) is a reduced expression of 2nw0 and is adapted to
the Dynkin quiver

(2) If i, j ∈ I2n+1 satisﬁes

then i = n + 2 and j = n. Hence it is enough to check that

[P (ij)] 6= [P (ji)] and i − j ≥ 2

(4.2)

0 ∈ [i 0] can be obtained by a sequence of commutation relations ij = ji for

any i ′
(i, j) 6= (n, n + 2), (n + 2, n).

To see this property, observe that the word (not reduced) i 0|J for J = {n, n + 1, n + 2} ⊂

I2n+1 is

i 0|J = (n n + 1 n + 2 n + 1)n(n n + 1).

Since there is n + 1 between every adjacent n and n + 2, (4.2) holds by Lemma 4.3.
Proposition 4.5. Let [i′
following properties.

(cid:3)

(1) There is n + 1 between every adjacent n and n + 2 in i′

(2) Let J = {n, n + 1, n + 2} ∈ I2n+1. We have P(i′

0|J ) = (n n + 1)nn or (n + 1 n)nn + 1.

Proof. We know the following facts:

(a) Any reduced expression j 0 in [i 0] satisﬁes j 0|J = (n n + 1 n + 2 n + 1)n(n n + 1),
(b) n∨ = n + 2, n + 1∨ = n + 1 and n + 2∨ = n.

Hence i ′

0|J is one of the followings:

(i) (n n + 1 n + 2 n + 1)n(n n + 1),
(ii) (n + 1 n + 2 n + 1)(n n + 1 n + 2 n + 1)n−1(n n + 1 n∨) = (n + 1 n + 2)(n +

(iii) n + 2(n + 1 n n + 1 n + 2)nn + 1∨ = (n + 2 n + 1 n n + 1)n(n + 2 n + 1),
(iv) (n+1 n n+1)(n+2 n+1 n n+1)n−1(n+2 n+1 n) = (n+1 n)(n+1 n+2 n+1 n)n.

We can check that (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) satisfy (1) and (2). Hence we proved the proposition. (cid:3)

Remark 4.6. In (4.3), one can observe that (n + 1)∨ = n + 1 becomes a sink or a source
(but not both) for any [i ′

0] ∈ [[Q♦]].

Proposition 4.7.

(1) If i′

0, i′′

0 ∈ [i0] ∈ [[Q♦]] then [P(i′

0)]. Hence we can denote

0)] = [P(i′′
P([i′

0]) := [P(i′

0)].

(2) Let [i′

0] be in the cluster point [[Q♦]]. Then [P(i′

0)] is in the cluster point [[Q]] for a

Dynkin quiver Q of A2n.

Proof. (1) Using Proposition 4.5 and Lemma 4.3, the analogous argument to the proof of
Proposition 4.4 (2) works.
(2) By (1), we can see that i ∈ I2n+1\{n + 1} is a sink (resp. source) in i ′
P(i) ∈ I2n is a sink (resp. source) in P (i ′
as the identity map then

0 if and only if
0). Also, P (i∨) = (P (i))∨. Hence If we regard rid

P([i ′

0] · ri) = [P(i ′

0)] · rP (i).

In Proposition 4.4, we showed P([i 0]) is adapted to a quiver Q of A2n. Since every adapted
(cid:3)
reduced expression consists of the unique cluster point [[Q]], we proved (2).

Example 4.8. For i 0 in Example 1.10,

Remark 4.9. By Proposition 4.7, if we restrict P to reduced expressions in [[Q♦]] then the
map can be considered as a map between classes in [[Q♦]] of A2n+1 and [[Q]] of A2n. We denote

P [[Q♦]]

(i) P ◦ R = id.
(ii) R preserves commutation relations, that is R(i)R(j) = R(j)R(i) if |i − j| ≥ 2.
(iii) If R(i)i is a reduced expression of w0 then [R(i)i ] · rR(i) = [i R(i∨)].

If we denote the reduced expression 2ni 0 = (1 2 · · · n 2n 2n − 1 · · · n + 1)n(1 2 · · · n) of

the longest element 2nw0 of A2n then i 0 = R(2ni 0). Now we assume that

[2ni ′

0] = [2ni 0] · ri = [i1i2 · · · il] is a class of reduced expressions of 2nw0

and

[i ′

0] = [i 0] · rR(i) = [R(2ni ′
Then, by (iii), i ∈ I2n is a source of [2ni ′
which starts with R(i). Moreover, we have

0] if and only if there is a reduced expression in [i ′
0]

[i ′

0] · rR(i1) = [R(i2 · · · il) R(i∨

As a conclusion, for any word i consisting of {1, · · · , 2n}, the class of reduced expressions

[i 0] · rR(i) = [R(i1 · · · il)] satisﬁes P [[Q♦]]([i 0] · rR(i)) = [i1, · · · , il] = [2ni 0] · ri.

Since every reduced expression adapted to a quiver consists of one cluster point, we proved
that P [[Q♦]] is an onto map.

In addition, since [i 0] · rR(i) = [R(i1 · · · il)] has n + 1 as a source and rn+1 · ([i 0] · rR(i)) has

n + 1 as a sink, these two are distinct classes. The following equation is easy to check:

P [[Q♦]]([i 0] · rR(i)) = P [[Q♦]](rn+1 · ([i 0] · rR(i))).

Hence we proved the proposition.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.11. The map P[[Q♦]] is a two-to-one and onto map. More precisely, for each

relations, we can ﬁnd j ′

n + 2. Hence we have

Similarly, we can show that there is a unique class [i ′

0] has n + 1 as a sink,

(a) [i ′
(b) P [[Q♦]]([i ′

Recall that we showed P [[Q♦]] is an onto map in Proposition 4.10. So we proved the
(cid:3)

proposition.

Theorem 4.12. The number of classes in [[Q♦]] is 22n.

Proof. Since there are 2n−1 arrows in a Dynkin quiver of A2n and each arrow has two possible
directions, the number of Dynkin quivers is 22n−1. Since the map P [[Q♦]] is a two-to-one and
(cid:3)
onto map, the number of classes in [[Q♦]] is 2 × 22n−1 = 22n.

Now we focus on classes of reduced expressions related to twisted Coxeter elements.

Proposition 4.13. Let ∨ : i 7→ n + 1 − i for i ∈ I2n and let i1i2 · · · in∨ be a twisted Coxeter
element of W2n. Then

there is a Dynkin quiver Q′ of type A2n such that

20

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

Since i1 i2 · · · in i∨
n is a Coxeter element of W2n, it is well known that there exists a
unique quiver Q′ determined by (1). Also, by Proposition 3.6, an adapted reduced expression
to Q′ has the property that

2 · · · i∨

# of i’s in the reduced expression =

2n + 1 + ai − bi

where ai is the number of arrows toward i in Q′ and bi is the number of arrows toward i∨
in Q′ between the vertices i and i∨. Hence instead of (2), we shall prove the quiver Q′ in (1)

for t = 1, · · · , n. Since ai∨

(i1 i2 · · · iα−1 iα+1 · · · in)(i1 i2 · · · iα−1 iα+1 · · · in)∨

is adapted to a quiver Q−
+1 which is isomorphic to a quiver Q− of type A2n−2, via i + 1 7→ i

Proof. There are two Dynkin quivers of type A2 and both satisﬁes the condition (4.7). Sup-
pose we proved for A2n−2.

If a Dynkin quiver Q′ of type A2n satisﬁes the condition (4.7), the subquiver Q′|J for

Proof. By Theorem 4.14, we know that P [[Q♦]](Ω) ⊂ [[Q]]. By counting the indices in [
Ω, we can easily see that P [[Q♦]](Ω) ⊂ Q. Since the map P [[Q♦]] is a two-to-one map, P [[Q♦]]
Ω
is also a two-to-one map. Moreover, since by Proposition 2.6 and Proposition 4.15, we know
that

|Ω| = 4 × 3n−1

and

|Q| = 2 × 3n−1.

(cid:3)

Hence P [[Q♦]]

Ω is onto.

Now we summarize results in this section, which can be understood as a surgery for ob-

taining [Q♦] ∈ [[Q♦]] of type A2n+1 from [Q] ∈ [[Q]] of type A2n:

Theorem 4.17. Let [[Q♦]] be the twisted adapted cluster point of type A2n+1 and [[Q]] be the
adapted cluster point of type A2n.

(1) The map P[[Q♦]] : [[Q♦]] → [[Q]] is a two-to-one and onto map.
(2) Let i′

0 be a reduced expression such that [i′

0] ∈ [[i0]]. Then [i′

0] has n + 1 as a source or

a sink, but not both.

(3) For each Dynkin quiver Q′ of type A2n, we get P−1

[[Q♦]](Q′) by the following procedure.

0 be a reduced expression of 2nw0 adapted to Q′.

(i) Let 2ni′
(ii) Substitute i ∈ {n + 1, · · · , 2n} in 2ni′
(iii) Between each adjacent n and n + 2, insert n + 1.
(iv) Insert another n + 1 at the beginning or at the end (not both) of the sequence

0 by i+ = i + 1.

obtained in (iii).

Note that, in (iii), the positions of n + 1’s are not unique. However, by commutation
relations, we get a unique class of reduced expressions. In (iv), we get two distinct
classes of reduced expressions.
(4) The number of classes in [[i0]] is 22n.
(5) The number of twisted Coxeter elements is 4 × 3n−1
(6) We can associate a twisted Coxeter element to a reduced expression of w0 in [[Q♦]],

in the sense of Theorem 4.14.

(7) A class of reduced expressions associated to a twisted Coxeter element is associated to

a Dynkin quiver satisfying (4.7), via the map P[[Q♦]] : [[Q♦]] → [[Q]].

The two distinct classes in (iii) obtained from Q of type A2n are denoted by

(4.8)

[Q<]

(

if n + 1 is a source of the class,
if n + 1 is a sink of the class.

Remark 4.20. As we can see in Example 4.18 and Example 4.19, the combinatorial AR-
quiver Υ[i 0] such that [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]] of type A2n+1 is closely related to the AR-quiver ΓQ for
Q := P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) of type A2n.
(1) From Υ[i 0] to ΓQ :

By deleting vertices in the n + 1-th residue of Υ[i 0] and unifying every length two
paths passing through n + 1-th residue into an arrow, we obtain a quiver isomorphic
to ΓQ. We rename the m-th residue (m ≥ n + 2) to m − 1-th residue.

(2) From ΓQ to Υ[i 0] :

(a) we put a vertex on every arrow between the n-th residue to the n + 1-th residue,
(b) since vertices obtained in (a) positioned in the n + 1-th residue, the original m-th

residue for m ≥ n + 1 should be renamed by the m + 1-th residue,

(c) break every arrow with the new vertex in (a) into two arrows, from the n-th
residue to the n + 1-th residue and from the n + 1-th residue to the n + 2-th
from the n + 2-th residue to the n + 1-th residue and from the
residue (resp.
n + 1-th residue to the n-th residue),

(d) put another vertex in the n + 1-th residue when αi is a source or a sink Υ[i 0].

Deﬁnition 4.21. For [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]] such that P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) = [Q], we denote by ΓQ ∩ Υ[i 0] the
set of all vertices in Υ[i 0] whose residues are contained in I2n+1 \ {n + 1} and by Υ[i 0] \ ΓQ
the set of all vertices in Υ[i 0] whose residues are n + 1.

Remark 4.22. By Remark 4.20, we sometimes identify the vertex in ΓQ ∩ Υ[i 0] as a vertex
in ΓQ also, and call it induced. Also,we call a subquiver ρ in Υ[i 0] induced if it contains a

vertex in ΓQ ∩ Υ[i 0] and a subquiver ρ in Υ[i 0] totally induced if all vertices ρ are contained
in ΓQ ∩ Υ[i 0].

5. Twisted AR-quivers

5.1. Coordinate system. Since every class [i 0] in [[Q♦]] is induced from some Dynkin quiver
Q of type A2n, we can assign coordinates for vertices in Υ[i 0] using those of ΓQ. To describe
the algorithm for Υ[i 0], we use the observations in Example 4.18, Example 4.19 and Remark
4.20. From now on, we call a combinatorial AR-quiver associated to twisted adapted class of
type A2n+1 as a twisted AR-quiver for simplicity.

Algorithm 5.1.

(a) For a vertex ΓQ ∩ Υ[i 0] whose coordinate in ΓQ is (i, p) (i ∈ I2n), we assign a new

coordinate (i+, p), where i+ = i + 1 if i > n and i+ = i if i ≤ n.

(b) For a vertex Υ[i 0] \ ΓQ whose residue is n + 1, we assign the coordinate :

(i) (n + 1, p − 1

2) if the vertex is a sink and (j, p) is a vertex which is connected with

the vertex by an arrow in Υ[i 0].

(ii) (n + 1, p + 1

2) if the vertex is a source and (j, p) is a vertex which is connected

with the vertex by an arrow in Υ[i 0].

(iii) (n + 1, p + 1

2) if the vertex is neither a sink nor a source and

(j, p) → the vertex → (j′, p + 1) in Υ[i 0]

where {j, j′} = {n, n + 2}.

For β ∈ Φ+, we denote by Ω[i 0](β) ∈ I × Z/2 the coordinate for β in Υ[i 0]
Example 5.2. The coordinates for Υ[Q<] and Υ[Q>] in Example 4.18 can be depicted as

TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS: I

Recall that, for every 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ n, β =

a≤k≤b αk is a positive root in Φ+ and every
positive root in Φ+ is of the form. Thus we sometimes identify β ∈ Φ+ (and hence vertex in
P
Υ[j 0]) with the segment [a, b]. For β = [a, b], we say a is the ﬁrst component of β and b is the
second component of β. If β is simple, we write β as [a].

Proposition 5.4. [26, Proposition 4.5] Fix any class [j0] of w0 of type An. Let ρ be an
N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) path in Υ[j0]. Then every positive roots contained in ρ has the
same ﬁrst (resp. second) component.

Theorem 5.5. [23, Corollary 1.12] Fix any Dynkin quiver Q of type An. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
ΓQ contains a maximal N-sectional path of length n − i once and exactly once whose vertices
share i as the ﬁrst component. At the same time, ΓQ contains a maximal S-sectional path of
length i − 1 once and exactly once whose vertices share i as the second component.

With the above theorem, we can label the vertices of ΓQ without computing like (3.6)
(see [23, Remark 1.14]). In this subsection, we give an algorithm on the labeling Υ[i 0] for
[i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]], by only using Proposition 5.4 and Theorem 5.5.

Deﬁnition 5.6. Fix any class [i 0] in [[Q♦]] of type A2n+1 such that P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) = [Q].

(a) A vertex is a central vertex of Υ[i 0] (i) if there exist two sectional paths which contain

Υ[i 0] \ ΓQ.

(b) The full subquiver Υ[i 0] of Υ[i 0] consisting of all central vertices is called a center of

(c) The full subquiver ΥNE

which are not contained in Υ[i 0] and located in the North-East (resp. South-East,
North-West and South-West) part of Υ[i 0].

Remark 5.7. By [15, Lemma 3.2.1], [15, (3.2)] and Theorem 5.5, every induced central
vertex in ΓQ is located at the intersection of a maximal S-sectional path and a maximal
N-sectional path of ΓQ whose lengths are lager than or equal to n − 1. Thus an induced
central vertex in ΓQ corresponds to a positive root β of type A2n which has αn or αn+1 as its
support. Here the support of β, denoted by supp(β), is deﬁned by the following way:

supp(β) := {αk | a ≤ k ≤ b} where

β =

αk.

Xa≤k≤b

Deﬁnition 5.8. For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π, the multiplicity of γ, denoted by m(γ) is a positive
integer deﬁned as follows:

If m(γ) = 1, we say that γ is multiplicity free.

m(γ) = max{ mi |

miαi = γ }.

Note that Υ[i 0] consists of induced maximal N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) paths and
non-induced vertices. Also every non-induced vertex is contained in some induced maximal
sectional path whose length is larger than or equal to n and is not located in an intersec-
tion of an induced maximal N-sectional path and an induced maximal S-sectional path.

We also remark here that induced maximal N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) of length k exists

By Theorem 3.11, we can get a reduced word i ′

Υ[i 0] by the following order

(5.4)

Note that

[i 0] are larger than or equal to n + 2,

[i 0] ⊂ ΓQ ∩ Υ[i 0] where P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) = [Q].

By Remark 4.20, Theorem 5.5, Remark 5.10 and (5.5), we have the following lemma:

Lemma 5.11.

(1) If a vertex v ∈ ΥNE

[i0] and the labeling of v in ΓQ is the same as [a, b] (b ≤ n), then the

labeling of v in Υ[i0] is [a, b].

(2) If a vertex v ∈ ΥSE

[i0] and the labeling of v in ΓQ is the same as [a, b] (a ≥ n + 1), then

(3) If a vertex v ∈ ΥNW

[i0] and the labeling of v in ΓQ is the same as [a, b] (a ≥ n + 1), then

the labeling of v in Υ[i0] is [a + 1, b + 1].

the labeling of v in Υ[i0] is [a + 1, b + 1].

(4) If a vertex v ∈ ΥSW

[i0] and the labeling of v in ΓQ is the same as [a, b] (b ≤ n), then the

labeling of v in Υ[i0] is [a, b].

Proof. (1) By reading ΥNE
in ΓQ. since R is an identity map for i < n.

[i 0] ﬁrst in (5.4), the labeling for v in Υ[i 0] should be the same as that

(2) By reading ΥSE

[i 0] ﬁrst in (5.4), the labeling for v in Υ[i 0] should be shifted by one, since

the image of i > n + 1 via R is the same as i + 1.

The remained assertions follow from i rev

0 where i rev
Remark 5.12. Note that all vertices in a maximal N-sectional (resp. S-sectional) path of
length k have labels [2n − k, b] for b ≥ 2n − k (resp. [b, k + 1] for b ≤ k + 1) in ΓQ. Hence
every vertex has a label of the form [2n + 1 − k, b] (b ≤ n) ΥNW
[i 0] (resp. [b, k] (b ≥ n) in
[i 0] , ΥNW
[i 0] ). In other words, we can label all vertices in ΥNE

[23, Remark 1.14]. Furthermore, we can say that every totally induced sectional path keeps
the rule in Theorem 5.5:

If a maximal N-sectional path of length k < n exits in Υ[i 0], its vertices share
2n + 1 − k as the ﬁrst component.
If a maximal S-sectional path of length k < n exits in Υ[i 0], its vertices share
k + 1 as the second component.

Proposition 5.13.

(1) Every vertex in a maximal N-sectional path whose length is k ≥ n has 2n + 1 − k as

the ﬁrst component.

(2) Every vertex in a maximal S-sectional path whose length is k ≥ n has k + 1 as the

second component.

Proof. Note that we have a maximal N-sectional path whose length is 2n. By Proposition
5.4, its ﬁrst component should be 1. Then, by the induction on length, our assertion easily
(cid:3)
follows. The second assertion follows in the same way.

By Lemma 5.11 and Proposition 5.13, we have the following theorem:

Theorem 5.14.

(1) Every induced maximal N-sectional path whose length is k shares 2n + 1 − k as a ﬁrst

component.

(2) Every induced maximal S-sectional path whose length is k shares k + 1 as a second

component.

Hence, for every vertex in Υ[i0], we can label it as [a, b] ∈ Φ+ for some 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2n + 1.

Proof. (1) and (2) are immediate consequences of Lemma 5.11 and Proposition 5.13. The
last assertion follows from the argument: (a) By Remark 5.7 and Remark 5.10, every induced
central vertex in Υ[i 0] is located at the intersection of two maximal induced (but not totally
induced) sectional paths whose lengths are larger n and hence we can label them as [a, b] for
some 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2n + 1. (b) By (a), only one vertex for each sectional path whose length is
lager k > 0 have not determined. Due to the system of Φ+, we can label the remained ones
(cid:3)
also.

Corollary 5.15.

(a) For the case of (1) or (4) in (5.1), every positive root whose second component (resp.
ﬁrst component) is n (resp. n + 1) corresponds to a non-induced vertex contained
in a maximal N-sectional of length k ≥ n (resp. a maximal S-sectional of length
k ≥ n + 1).

(a) For the case of (2) or (3) in (5.1), every positive root whose second component (resp.
ﬁrst component) is n + 1 (resp. n + 2) corresponds to a non-induced vertex contained
in a maximal N-sectional of length k ≥ n + 1 (resp. a maximal S-sectional of length
k ≥ n + 2).

TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS: I

31

[i 0] or ΥSW

Proof. (a) By (5.3) and Lemma 5.11, all labels of the form [a, b] (b ≤ n − 1) (resp.
[a, b]
(a ≥ n + 2)) appear in ΥNE
[i 0]). By Theorem 5.14 and (5.3), every
induced central vertex is located at an intersection of maximal S-sectional path of length
k ≥ n and an intersection of maximal N-sectional path of length l ≥ n + 1. Hence the set of
all induced central vertices has one to one correspondence with the set of all positive roots
of the form [2n + 1 − l, k + 1] (k ≥ n, l ≥ n + 1). Hence our assertion follows from Theorem
5.14.

[i 0] (resp. ΥNW

[i 0] or ΥSE

The assertion for (b) follows in the similar way.

(cid:3)

The following corollary follows from (a) in Deﬁnition 5.6 and Corollary 5.15:

Corollary 5.16.

(a) For the case of (1) or (4) in (5.1), every induced central vertex in Υ[i 0] corresponds β

having αn and αn+1 as its support if (1) or (4) in (5.1).

(b) For the case of (2) or (3) in (5.1), every induced central vertex in Υ[i 0] corresponds β

having αn+1 and αn+2 as its support if (2) or (3) in (5.1).

Deﬁnition 5.17. For any γ ∈ Φ+, the folded multiplicity of γ, denoted by m(γ) is a positive
integer deﬁned as follows:

m(γ) = max




Xj∈i

i ∈ I and

miαi = γ

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

i∈I
X

If m(γ) = 1, we say that γ is folded multiplicity free.



.






Remark 5.18. By Corollary 5.16, every folded multiplicity non-free positive root corresponds
to an induced central vertex. However, every induced central vertex does not correspond to
a folded multiplicity non-free positive root.

For an induced vertex in Υ[i 0], we can summarize as follows:

Corollary 5.19. Consider the map ι+ : I2n → I2n+1 such that ι+(i) = i for i = 1, · · · , n
and ι+(i) = i + 1 for i = n + 1, · · · , 2n. Then the labeling for the induced vertex v in Υ[i 0]
corresponding to [a, b] in ΓQ is determined as follows:

(5.6)

b
i=a αι+(i) + αn+1
b
i=a αι+(i)
(cid:26) P
P

if v ∈ Υ[i 0],
otherwise.

Now we shall give an example on the labeling without computation, for readers convenience:

6. Properties of twisted AR-quivers

In this section, we introduce and investigate the twisted additive property on twisted AR-
quiver Υ[i 0] for [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]]. Then we study the distance of a pair (α, β) with respect to the
bi-lexicographical order ≺b

[i 0] induced from ≺[i 0], which were studied in [25] for ≺b

[Q].

6.1. Twisted additive property. Throughout this subsection, [i 0] denotes a class in [[Q♦]]
of type A2n+1. The following is an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.14:

where α, β, γ, η ∈ Φ+. Then α + β = γ + η More precisely, if we denote α = [a, b] and

The following proposition is another immediate consequence of Corollary 5.15.

where k < n + 1 < l, the root γ corresponds to an induced central vertex and (α, β) corre-
sponds to a couple of non-induced vertices. Then we have α + β = γ.

Thus we have a twisted additive property, which can be understood as a generalization of

the additive property (3.4) of ΓQ, as follows: (cf. Proposition 7.7)
Theorem 6.3. For β ∈ Φ+ with Ω[i0](β) = (i, p) ∈ I × Z/2, assume that Ω[i0](α) = (i, p −
2 + δi,n+1). Then we have

and

if i = n + 2,
if i = n,
otherwise.

Example 6.4. In combinatorial AR-quiver of Example 5.20, we have n = 3. It is not hard

to see the twisted additive property holds, for examples,

(1) [1, 7] + [3, 5] = [1.5] + [3, 7],

(2) [1, 6] + [3, 7] = [3, 6] + [1, 7],

(3) [1, 3] + [4, 5] = [1, 5].

Note that if i is the index of β in Theorem 6.3, then (1) is an example for i = n, (2) is for
i 6= n, n + 1, n + 2 and (3) is for i = n + 1.

From the fact that ∗ =∨(2n+1,2) and (1.5), the reﬂection functor ri : [i 0] 7→ [i 0]ri can be

understood as a map Υ[i 0] 7→ Υ[i 0]ri described by coordinates (cf. Algorithm 3.7):

of [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]].

(A1) Remove the vertex (i, p) such that Ω[i 0](αi) = (i, p) and the arrows entering into (i, p)

6.2. Notions on sequences. In this section, we brieﬂy review the notions on sequences of
positive roots which were mainly introduced in [21, 25].

Convention 6.6. Let us choose a reduced expression j 0 = i1i2 · · · iN of w0 ∈ W and ﬁx a
convex total order ≤j 0 induced by j 0 and a labeling of Φ+ as follows:

Deﬁnition 6.10. [25, Deﬁnition 1.13, Deﬁnition 1.14]

(i) A pair p is called [j 0]-simple if there exists no sequence m ∈ ZN

≥0 such that

(6.4)

m ≺b

[j 0] p

and wt(m) = wt(p).

pairs (p

) such that mi1, mi2 > 0 are [j 0]-simple pairs.

Deﬁnition 6.11. [25, Deﬁnition 1.15] For a given [j 0]-simple sequence s = (s1, . . . , sN) ∈
ZN
≥0, we say that a sequence m ∈ ZN
m and wt(m) = wt(s),

≥0 is called a [j0]-minimal sequence of s if

(i) s ≺b
j 0
(ii) there exists no sequence m′ ∈ ZN
s ≺b

≥0 such that it satisﬁes the conditions in (i) and
[j 0] m′ ≺b
Deﬁnition 6.12. [25, Deﬁnition 4.8] We say that a sequence m has generalized [j0]-distance
k (k ∈ Z≥0), denoted by gdist[j 0](m) = k, if m is not [j 0]-simple and

[j 0] m.

(i) there exists a set of non [j 0]-simple sequences {m(s) | 1 ≤ s ≤ k, wt(m(s)) = wt(m)}

such that

(6.5)

m(1) ≺b

[j 0] · · · ≺b

[j 0] m(k) = m,

(ii) the set of non [j 0]-simple sequences {m(s)} has maximal cardinality among sets of

sequences satisfying (6.5).

If m is [j 0]-simple, we deﬁne gdist[j 0](m) = 0.
Deﬁnition 6.13. [25, Deﬁnition 1.19] For a non-simple positive root γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π, the [j0]-
radius of γ, denoted by rds[j 0](γ), is the integer deﬁned as follows:

rds[j 0](γ) = max(gdist[j 0](p) | γ ≺b

[j 0] p and wt(p) = γ).

Deﬁnition 6.14. [25, Deﬁnition 1.21] For a pair p, the [j0]-socle of p, denoted by soc[j 0](p),
is a [j 0]-simple sequence s such that

wt(p) = wt(s)

and s (cid:22)b

[j 0] p,

if such s exists uniquely.

Note that m(γ) = 1 for every positive root γ ∈ Φ+ of type Am.

Theorem 6.15. [25, Theorem 4.15, Theorem 4.20][23, Theorem 3.4] Let Q be any Dynkin
quiver of type Am.

(1) For any pair (α, β) ∈ Φ+, we have

gdist[Q](α, β) ≤ max{m(γ) | γ ∈ Φ+} = 1.

(2) For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π, we have

(3) For any p, soc[Q](p) is well-deﬁned.

rds[Q](γ) = m(γ).

36

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

6.3. Distance and radius with respect to [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]]. In this section we will prove the
following theorem:
Theorem 6.16. Take any [i0] ∈ [[Q♦]] of type A2n+1.

(1) For any pair (α, β) ∈ Φ+, we have

gdist[i0](α, β) ≤ max{m(γ) | γ ∈ Φ+} = 2.

(2) For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π, we have

In particular, rds[i0](γ) = 2 implies that m(γ) = 2.

(3) For any p, soc[i0](p) is well-deﬁned.

rds[i0](γ) ≤ 2.

Lemma 6.17. For a non-simple root γ corresponding to non-central vertex in Υ[i0], we have
rds[i0](γ) = m(γ) = 1.

[i 0] ⊔ ΥSW
Proof. Let us assume that γ ∈ ΥNE
[i 0] . Then, by Lemma 5.11 and Theorem 5.14, every
nonzero component of a sequence m with wt(m) = γ should appear in ΥNE
[i 0] . Hence
our assertion immediately follows from Remark 4.20, Lemma 5.19 and Theorem 6.15. We
can prove for γ ∈ ΥSE
(cid:3)

in the similar way.

[i 0] ⊔ ΥSW

[i 0] ⊔ ΥNW
[i 0]

Lemma 6.18. For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π corresponding to an induced central vertex,

rds[i0](γ) ≤ m(γ).
Proof. By Corollary 5.15 and Corollary 5.16, there exists a unique pair (α⋆, β⋆) corresponding
to non-induced central vertices such that α⋆ + β⋆ = γ. Also, by Remark 4.20, Lemma 5.19
and [25, Proposition 4.24], other pairs (α, β) such that α + β = γ corresponds to induced
vertices. Moreover, the pairs of induced vertices are not comparable with respect to ≺b
[i 0] by
Theorem 6.15. Thus our assertion follows from the fact that sometimes (α⋆, β⋆) is comparable
with a pair which consisting of induced vertices. In Example 5.20, we can see

[3, 5] ≺b

[i 0] (α⋆, β⋆) = ([4, 5], [3]) ≺b

[i 0] ([5], [3, 4]).

By [23, Theorem 3.2], the non-induced vertices pair of weight γ is less than other induced
vertices pairs of weight γ with respect to ≺b
[i 0] whenever they are comparable. Note that
there exists a unique induced central vertex which is a folded multiplicity free γ of height 2.
(cid:3)
In that case, rds[i 0](γ) = 1.
Lemma 6.19. For any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π corresponding to a non-induced central vertex,

rds[i0](γ) = m(γ) = 1.
Proof. Let us assume that [i 0] is the case (1) in (5.1). Then γ is [a, n] or [n+ 1, b]. We assume
further that γ = [a, n]. Then every pair for γ is of the form {[a, b − 1], [b, n]}. Without loss
of generality, we assume that the pair consisting of {[a, c − 1], [c, n]} is less than the pair
consisting of {[a, d − 1], [d, n]} with respect to ≺b
[i 0]. Then there is a path between [c, n] and
[d, n].

TWISTED COXETER ELEMENTS AND FOLDED AR-QUIVERS: I

37

Suppose [d, n] ≺[i 0] [c, n]. Then there is a path from [c, n] to [d, n]. We can take a path
goes through two special vertices : (i) the nearest vertex Vd = [d, ∗] from [d, n] which lies
in the n + 2-th layer, (ii) Vc = [c, ∗]. (i.e. the path [c, n] → Vc → Vd → [d, n].) We know
[d, n] ≺[i 0] [a, c − 1] so that Vd ≺[i 0] [a, c − 1], Vc. Also, we have [a, c − 1], Vc ≺[i 0] [a, d − 1] by
the fact that Vc ≺[i 0] [c, n]. Hence the following facts hold: (i) the pair with {[a, c − 1], Vc}
is less than the pair with {[a, d − 1], Vd}, (ii) the two pairs have the same weight γ ∈ Φ+\Π,
(iii) every vertices in both pairs are induced vertices. However, it contradicts to Theorem
6.15 (2).

Also, when there is a path from [d, n] to [c, n], we can prove by similar arguments.

(cid:3)

The ﬁrst step for Theorem 6.16. From the above three lemmas, the second assertion of
Theorem 6.16 follows. Furthermore, the ﬁrst and the third assertions for α + β ∈ Φ+ also
(cid:3)
hold.

Proposition 6.20. [25, Proposition 4.5] For a Dynkin quiver Q of type Am and (α, β) with
α + β 6∈ Φ+ and gdist[Q](α, β) = 1, there exists a unique rectangle in ΓQ given as follows:

where α + β = γ + η and (γ, η) ≺b

Q (α, β). Furthermore,

(a) there is no pair (α′, β′) 6= (γ, η) such that (α′, β′) ≺b
(b) supp(α) ∩ supp(β) 6= ∅.

Q (α, β) and α + β = α′ + β′,

Proposition 6.21. For any pair (α, β) of type A2n+1 such that α + β 6∈ Φ+,

gdist[i0](α, β) ≤ 2.

Proof. For (α, β) which satisﬁes one of the following properties:

• supp(α) ∩ supp(β) = ∅,
• their ﬁrst (resp. second) components are the same,
• they are incomparable with respect to ≺[i 0],

one can prove easily that gdist[i 0](α, β) = 0 by using the convexity of ≺[i 0] and Theorem 5.14.
Thus gdist[i 0](α, β) > 0 implies that there exists a rectangle alike (6.6) or one of α and β is
a non-induced vertex. By Remark 4.20 if there is a rectangle alike (6.6) then the rectangle
can be classiﬁed with the followings:

(i) the rectangle without non-induced vertices on it,
(ii) the rectangle with two non-induced vertices whose ﬁrst or second component are the

same,

(iii) the rectangle with two non-induced vertices whose sum is contained in Φ+ by Lemma

5.15,

where ⋆ denotes a non-induced vertex.

Let the set of vertices V satisfy (a) every vertex in V is in or on the rectangle (see the
above pictures) and (b) the sum of all elements is α + β. Denote by VN the set of non-induced
vertices in V lies on a N-sectional path and by VS the set of non-induced vertices in V lies
on a S-sectional path. Then we note that

(IND-1) |VN | = |VS|,
(IND-2) if α1 ∈ VN and α2 ∈ VS then α1 + α2 is the root in or on the rectangle,
(IND-3) if V consists of induced vertices then V = {α, β} or V = {γ, η}.

(ii) Suppose VN 6= ∅ and VS 6= ∅. Then α1 ∈ VN and α2 ∈ VS satisfy (IND-2) and, moreover,
the root α′ = α1 + α2 6= α, β, γ or δ. Consider the set V \{α1, α2} ∪ {α′} is another set of
vertices satisfying (a) and (b). Hence it contradicts to (IND-3). In this case, by (IND-3),
gdist[i 0](α, β) = 1
(iii) Suppose VN ∪ VS = {µ, ν} then, for the case (iii-1), V = {γ, µ, ν} (resp. for the case (iii-
2), V = {η, µ, ν}). Otherwise the V \{µ, ν} ∪ {η} (resp. V \{µ, ν} ∪ {γ}) is a contradiction to
(IND-3). Conversely, we can prove that VN ∪NS should be ∅ or {µ, ν} by the same argument.
In this case, since the sequence determined by {γ, µ, ν} (resp. {η, µ, ν}) is between the pair
(γ, η) and (α, β) with respect to ≺b
[i 0], we have gdist[i 0] = 2.

Now let α be an induced vertex and β be a non-induced vertex.

Suppose β ≺[i 0] α and take the non-induced vertex β− such that β− is the largest non-
induced root (with respect to ≺[i 0]) satisfying β− ≺[i 0] β . Now let β+ = β + β−. Then β+
satisﬁes (1) β+ ≺[i 0] β, (2) β′ ≺[i 0] β if and only if β′ ≺[i 0] β or β′ = β+. Since α and β+ are
induced vertices, we can consider the set V + of vertices satisfying (a) and (b) associated to
α and β+. In order to see gdist[i 0](α, β), we need to ﬁnd a set W of vertices such that (a’)
every element is in or on the rectangle determined by β+ and α (b’) the sum of elements is
α + β. One can easily see W ∪ {β−} satisﬁes the conditions for V +. Hence depending on
whether (α, β+) is a case of (ii) or (iii), we get gdist[i 0](α, β) = 0 or 1. For the latter case, we
have W = {γ, ν} and V + = {γ, β−, ν}. The same argument works for the case α ≺[i 0] β. (cid:3)

The second step for Theorem 6.16. From the above propositions, the ﬁrst and the third
(cid:3)
assertions complete.

Remark 6.22. In [23], it was shown that for a Dynkin quiver Q of type Am and a root
γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π, we have

rds[Q](γ) = m(γ).

Analogously, if a twisted adapted class [i 0] of type A2n+1 is associated to a twisted Coxeter
element then we have

(6.7)

rds[i 0](γ) = m(γ)

for any γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π. However, if a twisted adapted class [i 0] of type A2n+1 which is not
associated to a twisted Coxeter element then (6.7) can be either true or not. More precisely,
if P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) = [Q] for a Dynkin quiver Q with the subquiver •

(α, β) for γ satisﬁes one of the following conditions: Set Ω[i0](α) = (i, p) and Ω[i0](β) = (j, q).

(i) i = j = n + 1 such that p + q = 2r,
(ii) q = |k− − i−| + p, r = p − |k− − j−|, i, j 6= n + 1 and one of the following holds:

(6.9)





(a) i + j = k and k ≤ n,
(b) (2n + 1 − i−) + (2n + 1 − j−) = 2n + 1 − k−, k ≤ n and min{i, j} ≤ n,
(c) i− + j− = k−, k ≥ n + 2 and max{i, j} ≥ n + 2,
(d) (2n + 2 − i) + (2n + 2 − j) = 2n + 2 − k and k ≥ n + 2.

Proof. By Lemma 6.18, γ with m(γ) = 2 has a unique pair (α, β) which consists of non-
induced central vertices and is an [i 0]-minimal of γ. Then the ﬁrst assertion follows. The
other [i 0]-minimal pairs of γ are induced from ΓQ and incomparable with the non-induced
pair. Then one can easily check that the other [i 0]-minimal pairs satisfy one of the four
(cid:3)
conditions in (6.9) by Theorem 6.24.

Lemma 6.26. For an induced vertex γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π with Ω[i0](γ) = (k, r) and m(γ) = 1, an
[i0]-minimal pair (α, β) for γ satisﬁes one of the following conditions : Set Ω[i0](α) = (i, p)
and Ω[i0](β) = (j, q).

(i) i = j = n + 1 such that p + q = 2r,
(ii) p − r = |k− − i−|, q − r = −|k− − j−| and

i− + j− = k− or (2n + 1 − i−) + (2n + 1 − j−) = 2n + 1 − k−.

Proof. Note that the existence of the non-induced pair for γ is not guaranteed (see Remark
5.18). In this case, each pair for γ induced from ΓQ is not comparable with the non-induced
(cid:3)
pair for γ. Then we can apply the same argument of the previous lemma.

Lemma 6.27. For a non-induced central vertex γ ∈ Φ+ \ Π with Ω[i0](γ) = (n + 1, r), an
[i0]-minimal pair (α, β) for γ satisﬁes one of the following conditions: Set Ω[i0](α) = (i, p)
and Ω[i0](β) = (j, q).

(i) (i, p) = (n + 1, r + 2ℓ) and (j, q) = (ℓ, r − 1
(ii) (i, p) = (n + 1, r + 2ℓ) and (j, q) = (2n + 2 − ℓ, r − 1
(iii) (i, p) = (ℓ, r + 1
(iv) (i, p) = (2n + 2 − ℓ, r + 1

2 + (n − ℓ)) and (j, q) = (n + 1, r − 2ℓ),

2 − (n − ℓ)),

2 + (n − ℓ)) and (j, q) = (n + 1, r − 2ℓ),

2 − (n − ℓ)),

for some ℓ ∈ Z≥1.

Proof. Let us assume that γ = [a, n + 1] for some a ≤ n and is contained in the N-Sectional
path N[a] of length 2n+1−a. Note that {α, β} = {[a, k], [k+1, n+1]} for some a ≤ k < n+1.
We assume further that β = [k + 1, n + 1]. Equivalently, Ω[i 0](β) = (n + 1, r − 2ℓ) for some
ℓ ∈ Z≥1 by Corollary 5.15. Note that there exists an S-sectional path S[k] of length k − 1

• whose vertices shares k as their second component,
• which intersects with N[a].

Furthermore, the vertex located at the intersection of N[a] and S[k] is [a, k]. By the as-
sumption that [a, k] ≺[i 0] [a, n + 1], the [i 0]-residue i of [a, k] is strictly less than n + 1 by
Theorem 5.14. By applying [23, Corollary 1.15] , Algorithm 5.1 and Theorem 5.14, we have
the following in Υ[i 0]:

Hence we can obtain that i = ℓ which yields our third assertion. For the remained cases, one

can prove by applying the similar argument.

7. Folded AR-quivers

7.1. Folding the twisted AR-quiver. For any Dynkin quiver Q of type A2n, we know
that i 6≡ i∨(2n,2) mod 2. Thus, for any α, β ∈ Φ+ such that ΩQ(α) = (i, p) and ΩQ(β) =
(2n + 1 − i, q), we have

(7.1)

p 6≡ q mod 2.

Thus we can fold a twisted AR-quiver by assigning new coordinates in I × Z in the following
way:

Remark 7.5. Note that I can be thought as an index set of Bn+1. Let us introduce an
interesting observation (Algorithm 7.6) in the sense that the action of reﬂection functors on
twisted AR-quivers of type A2n+1 can be described by the notions on the ﬁnite type Bn+1 :
In order to do this, we ﬁx notations as follows.

(a) Let D = diag(di | i ∈ I) = diag(2, 2, . . . , 2, 1) be the diagonal matrix which diagonal-

izes the Cartan matrix A = (aij) of type Bn+1.

(b) We denote by d = lcm(di | i ∈ I) = 2.

Recall that the involution ∗ induced by the longest element w0 of type Bn+1 is an identity
map i 7→ i.

Now we shall describe the algorithm which shows a way of obtaining

Υ[i 0]ri from

Υ[i 0] by

using the notations on Bn+1. (cf. Algorithm 6.5.)

Algorithm 7.6. Let h∨ = 2n + 1 be a dual Coxeter number of Bn+1 and αi (i ∈ I) be a sink
of [i 0] ∈ [[Q♦]].

b

b

(A1) Remove the vertex (i, p) such that

Ω[i 0](αi) = (i, p) and the arrows entering into (i, p)

in

Υ[i 0].

(A2) Add the vertex (i, p − d × h∨) and the arrows to all vertices whose coordinates are
Υ[i 0], where j is adjacent to i in Dynkin diagram of

b

(j, p − d × h∨ + min(di, dj)) ∈
type Bn+1.

(A3) Label the vertex (i, p − d × h∨) with αi and change the labels β to si(β) for all

b

β ∈

Υ[i 0] \ {αi}.

Also, using coordinates in

Υ[i 0], the twisted additive property can be restated as follows.

(cf. Theorem 6.3)

b

Proposition 7.7. Let α and β be positive roots with coordinates (i, 2p − 2|i|) and (i, 2p) in
Υ[i0]. Here i ∈ I and |i| denotes the number of indices in the orbit i. Then

where γ ∈ J consists of γ which are on paths from α to β and have the coordinates (j, 2p −
2|i|−1) for j ∈ ¯I.

Remark 7.8. Proposition 7.7 is equivalent to Theorem 6.3. However, Proposition 7.7 is
better to see relations between additive properties of ΓQ and twisted additive properties of
Υ[Q♦]. In Proposition 7.7, if we take |¯i| = 1 for all i ∈ I then we directly obtain additive
properties of ΓQ.

In this section, we brieﬂy review the distance polynomial deﬁned on the adapted cluster
point [[Q]] which was studied in [25]. Here Q is any Dynkin quiver of type ADEm. Then
we introduce and study the folded distance polynomial which is well-deﬁned on the twisted
adapted cluster point [[Q♦]] of type A2n+1 and is deeply related to quantum aﬃne algebra of
type B(1)
n+1. This section can be understood as a twisted analogue of [25, Section 6]. For this
section and next section, we refer to and follow [25, Section 6] and [17] for quantum aﬃne
algebras, their integrable representations and denominator formulas.

Let us take a base ﬁeld k the algebraic closure of C(q) in ∪m>0C((q1/m)).

8.1. Distance polynomial. For our purpose, we assume that the Dynkin quiver Q is of
type A2n with its index set I2n.

Deﬁnition 8.1. [25, Deﬁnition 6.11] For a Dynkin quiver Q, indices k, l ∈ I2n and an integer
t ∈ N, we deﬁne the subset ΦQ(k, l)[t] of Φ+ × Φ+ as follows:

A pair (α, β) is contained in ΦQ(k, l)[t] if α ≺Q β or β ≺Q α and

{ΩQ(α), ΩQ(β)} = {(k, a), (l, b)}

such that

|a − b| = t.

Lemma 8.2. [25, Lemma 6.12] For any (α(1), β(1)) and (α(2), β(2)) in ΦQ(k, l)[t], we have

oQ
t (k, l) := gdistQ(α(1), β(1)) = gdistQ(α(2), β(2)).
We denoted by Qrev the quiver obtained by reversing all arrows of Q and Q∗ the quiver
obtained from Q by replacing vertices of Q from i to i∗. Here ∗ : i ↔ 2n + 1 − i (i ≤ n) is an
involution on I2n induced by the longest element w0 of W2n.

Proof. (1) Assume that k, l ∈ I \ {n + 1}. By the observation in (7.1), the set Φ[i 0](k, l)[t] is
induced from one of

ΦQ(k, l)[t/2] ⊔ ΦQ(k∗, l∗)[t/2] and ΦQ(k∗, l)[t/2] ⊔ ΦQ(k, l∗)[t/2].
(8.2)
where P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) = [Q] and i ∗↔ 2n + 1 − i. Note that one of the sets in (8.2) must be empty.
In each case, if there exists a path from β(1) to α(1) passing through two non-induced
vertices, then so is (α(2), β(2)). Then our assertion for this case follows from Corollary 5.19,
Theorem 6.16 and Lemma 8.2.

(2) Assume that k = l = {n + 1}. By Lemma 5.15 either (i) α(j) + β(j) ∈ Φ+ or (ii)

α(j) + β(j) 6∈ Φ+ for all j. Then, for all j, we have

(3) Assume that one of k and l is n + 1 and the other is not. Let us ﬁx k = n + 1 and
Ω[i 0](α) = (n + 1, a). As in the same reason of (i), β is induced from some vertex whose
residue is one of l and l∗. Note that for α ≺[i 0] γ ≺[i 0] β,

b+1γ ∈ Φ+ and

Thus there exists k ∈ Z such that

gdist[i 0](α(1), β(1)) = gdist[i 0](α(2), β(2)),

b+kβ(1) = β(2). Hence we have

where Dk,l(z) = Dl,k(z) = Dk∗,l∗(z) = Dl∗,k∗(z) and i ∗↔ 2n + 1 − i.

Theorem 8.13. For any twisted adapted class [i0], the denominator formulas for U ′
can be read from

q(B(1)

Υ[i0] as follows:

Dk,l(z) × (z − qh∨

where h∨ is the dual Coxeter number of Bn+1.

Proof. Fix Q such that P [[Q♦]]([i 0]) = [Q].

(1) Assume that k, l ∈ I \ {n + 1}. Then one of oQ

t (k∗, l) is positive implies
(k, l) = 1 by Proposition 6.21. Thus our assertion for this

t (k, l) and oQ

that o[i 0]
case follows from (8.4).

(k, l) > 0 and hence o[i 0]

(2) Assume that k = l = n + 1. Then our assertion is obvious by Corollary 5.15 and

Corollary 6.2.

(3) In general, it suﬃces to consider only one folded AR-quiver

In this section, we shall interpret Dorey’s rule for U ′

q(B(1)
n+1), studied in [6], via [i 0]-minimal
A2n+1 when [i 0] is twisted adapted. Such interpretation is analogous to
q(A(i)

Appendix: Foldable cluster r-points for exceptional cases

In this appendix, we show the existence of foldable cluster r-points for exceptional cases

for E6 associated with ∨ in (1.3) and D4 associated with ∨ in (1.4).

50

S.-J. OH, U. SUH

For type E6, there exists a ∨-foldable cluster r-point [[i 0]] where ∨ is the one in (1.3):

8

i 0 =

(1 2 6 3)k∨.

The r-cluster point [[i 0]] is called the twisted adapted cluster point of type E6 and a class
in [i ′
0] ∈ [[i 0]] is called a twisted adapted class of type E6. Furthermore, there are 32 distinct
twisted adapted classes in [[i 0]] while there are only 24 distinct twisted Coxeter elements.
Here the number 32 coincides with the number of distinct Dynkin quivers of type E6.

Yk=0

For type D4, there exists a unique ∨-foldable cluster r-point [[i 0]] and a unique ∨2-foldable

cluster r-point [[j 0]] where ∨ is the one in (1.4):

5

5

i 0 =

(2 1)k∨

and j 0 =

(2 1)2k∨.

Yk=0

Yk=0

The r-cluster points [[i 0]] and [[j 0]] are called the triply twisted adapted cluster points of
type D4 and a class in [i ′
0] ∈ [[i 0]] ⊔ [[j 0]] is called a triply twisted adapted class of type D4.
Each triply twisted adapted class consists of a unique reduced expression and there are 6
distinct twisted adapted classes in each triply twisted adapted cluster point. Recall 12 is the
number of distinct triply twisted Coxeter elements.
