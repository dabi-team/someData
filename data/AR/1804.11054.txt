Abstract 

We  apply  three  optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT)  image  analysis  techniques  to  extract  morphometric 
information from OCT images obtained on peripheral nerves of rat. The accuracy of each technique is evaluated 
against histological measurements accurate to +/-1 µm. The three OCT techniques are: 1) average depth resolved 
profile  (ADRP);  2)  autoregressive  spectral  estimation  (AR-SE);  and,  3)  correlation  of  the  derivative  spectral 
estimation  (CoD-SE).  We  introduce  a  scanning  window  to  the  ADRP  technique  which  provides  transverse 
resolution,  and  improves  epineurium  thickness  estimates  -  with  the  number  of  analysed  images  showing 
agreement with histology increasing from 2/10 to 5/10 (Kruskal-Wallis test, α = 0.05). A new method of estimating 
epineurium  thickness,  using  the  AR-SE  technique,  showed  agreement  with  histology  in  6/10  analysed  images 
(Kruskal-Wallis test, α = 0.05). Using a tissue sample in which histology identified two fascicles with an estimated 
difference  in  mean  fibre  diameter  of  4  µm,  the  AR-SE  and  CoD-SE  techniques  both  correctly  identified  the 
fascicle with larger fibre diameter distribution but incorrectly estimated the magnitude of this difference as 0.5µm. 
The ability of OCT signal analysis techniques to extract accurate morphometric details from peripheral nerve is 
promising but restricted in depth by scattering in adipose and neural tissues. 

1 Introduction 

In the field of neural prosthetics, the performance of nerve cuffs for recording and stimulating bio-electric 
signals  can  be  improved  using  physiologically  accurate  volume  conductor  models  of  nerves  [1,  2].  The 
morphometric details required for such models are the size, number and location of fascicles, the thickness of 
ultra-structural tissue layers, and the spatial variations in fibre diameter distribution. It is common to use simplified 
morphometric details, such as in [2-4], however, the results are not transferrable to patients due to patient specific 
tissue morphology. Another approach is to use destructive imaging methods, such as light microscopy, to acquire 
micrometre resolution histological images of the nerve cross section at one location and then extrude this along 
the length dimension, such as in [5, 6], however, this does not account for the length variation in tissue morphology 
caused  by  fascicle  bifurcation  [7].  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  enhanced  with  gadolinium-DTPA 
(diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) contrast agent, a non-destructive imaging method, has been used to image 
the size, number and location of fascicles in an extracted nerve tissue with a voxel size of 30 x 30 x 250 µm3 [1], 
which  is  promising,  particularly  if  replicated  with  in-vivo  measurements.  For  a  patient-specific  and 
physiologically accurate  model, a non-destructive  volumetric imaging  method is required  with a resolution of 
several µm. 

The structure of peripheral nerves comprises one or more fascicles bound together by epineurium tissue 
10’s of μm thick [8]. In humans, the median nerve is several mm across and can contain 10 or more fascicles at 
the elbow, with each fascicle ranging in size from 0.12 to 2 mm2 [9], whereas, in comparison, the rat sciatic nerve 
is approximately 1 mm across and can contain 3 to 4 fascicles ranging in size from 0.05 to 1mm2. Each fascicle 
contains several thousand nerve fibres bound together by endoneurium tissue, and encompassed by a  layer of 
perineurium tissue several μm thick [10]. Nerve fibres are long cylinders ranging in size from 1 μm to 22 μm 
diameter and are heterogeneously distributed within fascicles [9]; they are also highly aligned, densely packed, 
and usually sheathed in lipid rich myelin from encasing Schwann cells. The orders of magnitude of the dimensions 
of the nerves under study place Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a non-destructive imaging method, well 
as a potential means to acquire morphometric details without damaging the nerve.  

Qualitative OCT techniques of distinguishing neural tissue from surrounding tissue [11-14], identifying 
different neural tissue layers [11-13, 15, 16], and analysing levels of myelination [17] do not provide quantified

values nor confidence levels. On the other hand, quantitative OCT techniques, such as the depth-resolved analysis 
of optical properties [18] and statistical analysis of spectra [19, 20], provide quantified  values for nerve tissue 
morphometry but have not been validated. Other quantitative OCT techniques, such as analysis of Mie scatter 
spectra [21] and optical scattering properties [22], have been used to classify tissue but have not yet been applied 
to peripheral nerves. There is therefore a need to evaluate and validate the performance of OCT techniques in 
imaging peripheral nerves, which builds on preliminary work in ref [23]. 

In this paper, we present results from three quantitative OCT signal analysis techniques that we identified 
in  the  literature  and  replicated  with  some  improvements  on  images  of  rat  sciatic  nerve  acquired  with  a  swept 
source  OCT  (SS-OCT)  system.  Of  the  three  OCT  techniques  -  average  depth  resolved  profile  (ADRP), 
autoregressive spectral estimation (AR-SE), and correlation of the derivative spectral estimation (CoD-SE) – one, 
the former, was developed specifically for estimation of epineurium thickness while the latter two were developed 
for scatter size estimation applications. With each technique, we attempt two tasks: 1) extract the epineurium layer 
thickness,  and  2)  distinguish  adipose  tissue.  In  addition  to  this,  for  the  two  techniques  based  on  scatter  size 
estimation  we  attempt  a  third  task:  3)  estimation  of  fibre  diameter  distribution.  We  compare  our  results  to 
histological analysis performed on light-microscopy images, a step which is absent in the original reporting of the 
OCT techniques [18-21, 24]. When replicating each technique, parameters were selected using unbiased methods, 
or  otherwise  noted  as  biased,  to  ensure  fair  comparison  and  practical  application.  We  demonstrate  new 
applications of the two scatterer size estimation techniques by using them to evaluate the combined thickness of 
epineurium  and  perineurium  tissue,  and  to  differentiate  adipose  tissue  from  neural  tissues.  The  scatterer  size 
estimation techniques were also used to evaluate the fibre diameter distribution of nerve fibres within fascicles. 
The  results  help  establish  the  abilities  and  limitations  of  current  OCT  techniques  in  extracting  morphometric 
details  from  peripheral  nerves,  and  demonstrate  the  potential  for  OCT  based  scatterer  diameter  estimation 
techniques in this area.  

2 Materials and Methods 

2.1 Tissue preparation and handling 

The  animal  procedures  were  approved  by  the  University  of  Auckland  Animal  Ethics  Advisory 
Committee.  All  animal  specimens  were  rats  of  Wistar  breed  and  male.  Euthanasia  was  performed  by  first 
anaesthetising with isoflurane and then performing cervical dislocation. A total of 3 nerve tissue samples were 
explanted, each extending the entire length of the sciatic nerve and, distal to bifurcation, as much of the tibial and 
peroneal branches as practicable. Samples were then stored in 0.01M phosphate buffered solution at 4ºC for up to 
three days before imaging on OCT. Several points along each tissue sample were randomly selected and marked 
with Davidson’s marking dye and 1% picric acid, and these points imaged with OCT. In this study we present 
results and images from one point each from the sciatic section of two nerves, and one point from the tibial section 
of one nerve. 

During OCT imaging, tissue samples were suspended at two points 20mm apart along the length. Sagging 
of the tissue sample was used as a visual indication that the tissue sample was not mechanically stretched. Four 
OCT  images,  at  90º  offsets,  were  acquired  of  the  dyed  points  within  the  suspended  section.  Between  image 
acquisitions 0.01M phosphate buffered solution was applied to the outside of the nerve, using a syringe, to avoid 
tissue drying. Post imaging, the tissue samples were returned to the phosphate buffered solution and transported 
to the Anatomy and Medical Imaging department at the University of Auckland for histological analysis by light 
microscopy.  

Error introduced by thermal expansion, caused by variation in the sample temperature during imaging 
between 4ºC and 20ºC, is expected to be <0.5% using the thermal expansion coefficient of water. Error introduced 
from stretching, due to suspension of the tissue samples during OCT imaging, is <0.05% using a Poisson’s ratio 
and Young’s modulus of 0.37 and 41MPa respectively [25].  

2.2 Microsphere samples 

Three  microsphere  samples  (Spherotech  Inc.)  were  used  in  this  study  with  concentration,  and  mean 
diameter +/- 1 standard deviation of: 1) 5% w/v, 3.8 +/-0.25 µm; 2) 5% w/v, 5.33 +/-0.25 µm; and 3) 2.5% w/v 
8.49 +/-0.25 µm. Standard deviations of their respective size distribution were calculated using measured data 
provided by the supplier with the samples. For each sample, the vial containing the microspheres in solution was 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

shaken vigorously to ensure homogeneity of the solution before a 1 mL sample was extracted and transported, 
using a pipette, to a separate container under the OCT system and immediately imaged.  

2.3 OCT image acquisition and processing 

The OCT system has a swept source centred at 1310 nm with an 80nm bandwidth (3dB). The system has 
12.5 μm axial resolution, 20 μm lateral resolution, and the 6 dB drop off in air is over 12mm. More details of the 
OCT system can be found in refs [26, 27].  

The B-scan direction was perpendicular to the length of the nerve tissue samples, spanned a physical 
distance of 5mm, and contained 714 A-scans. B-scans were saved from the LABVIEW® user interface to text 
files  and  then  processed  individually  with  MATLAB®  2015b  using  the  signal  analysis  techniques  described 
below. 

In order to determine the distance when calculating epineurium thickness, an average refractive index 
had to be used for the entire OCT image; here, we have used the refractive index of n=1.40, which is the average 
of values reported for myelin (
) [29]. The 
axial distance per pixel, of 10 µm in air, was, therefore, 7.1 µm in neural tissues in all subsequent calculations of 
epineurium thickness.

2.4 Histological analysis by light microscopy  

Histology by light microscopy was performed at 1 location on each of the tissue samples, see Fig. 1. 
Tissue samples were preserved in 10% Neutral Buffered formalin for 24 hours, followed by 70% ethanol prior to 
paraffin embedding. Tissue slices 10 µm thick were obtained using a microtome then Haemotoxylin & Eosin was 
used  to  stain  the  collagen  rich  epineurium,  perineurium  and  endoneurium  tissues  pink.  Lipid  rich  myelin  was 
stained  with  Luxol  Fast  Blue.  Images  were  obtained  on  a  Leica  DM500  light  microscope  at  4x,  10x  and  40x 
magnifications. A uniform shrinkage of 10%, produced during the preparation process, was taken into account by 
multiplying all values extracted from histology by a factor of 1.1.  

The thickness of epineurium tissues was determined using images obtained at 4x magnification. In each 
image,  a  line  was  drawn  through  the  tissue  layers,  perpendicular  to  the  tissue  outer  surface,  at  20  locations 
approximately  equidistant  around  the  fascicle  boundaries.  Then,  the  thickness  of  tissue  along  these  lines  was 
measured manually. Error introduced by the measurement procedure was estimated to be +/- 1 µm. 

Fibre  diameter  distribution  was  calculated  in  areas  of  the  tissue  sample  images  which  were  visually 
identified as containing few artefacts from sample preparation. A grid of 100 μm squares was laid over the area 
of interest in the 40x magnification images and the fibre diameter distribution was calculated for each grid square. 
Fibres were typically ellipsoid shaped, therefore, the major and minor axes were used to calculate the diameter of 
a circle with equivalent area. The diameter estimates contained approximately +/-1 µm uncertainty. Furthermore, 
the method employed could not identify fibre diameters less than 3 µm due to the very thin, or absent in the case 
of unmyelinated fibres, myelin sheath.  

2.5 Average depth resolved profile (ADRP) techniques  

Two techniques to identify the fascicle boundary, one using structural data and the other phase retardation 
data, are presented in ref [18]. Both techniques are applied to the average depth-resolved profile (ADRP) of the 
middle 50% of A-scans of the tissue sample. The ADRP is generated by first cropping pixels outside the tissue 
sample, then flattening the remaining pixels so that each row in the columns of data (A-scan) correlates to the 
same axial depth in the tissue sample, and, finally, averaging values across each row. In order to estimate the 
fascicle boundary with higher lateral resolution we implemented the ADRP across windows containing 5 A-scans, 
which were scanned laterally across the sample in 1 pixel steps.   

To  identify  the  fascicle  boundary  the  ADRP-structural-data  technique  plots  the  signal  to  noise  ratio 
(SNR) of the ADRP on a logarithmic scale against depth, then fits a linear slope to the uniformly decaying region 
of the curve, Fig 1. The absolute difference between the linear fit and the ADRP curve forms the residual SNR 
curve. A threshold value is then calculated as the mean plus 2 standard deviations from the linear portion of the 
residual SNR curve. The fascicle boundary is identified by the intersection of the threshold value and the curve 
neighbouring the uniformly decaying region. In our implementation of the 5 A-scan sliding window method, we 
fit the linear slope to data from a depth range of 15 to 50 pixels in all window ADRPs, Fig 1. The start value of

15 pixels, correlates to a depth of 113 µm, which is outside the typical epineurium thickness values provided by 
histological analysis and, therefore, is highly unlikely to include epineurium tissue.  

To identify adipose tissue, we calculated the threshold from the entire portion of the residual SNR curve, 
instead of just the linear portion, which increases the threshold value. In areas with epineurium, the residual-SNR 
curve in the uniformly decaying region was below the threshold and the initial peaks of the residual-SNR curve, 
associated with epineurium, was above the threshold. Conversely, in areas with adipose tissue, which contained 
multiple peaks and no uniformly decaying region, the residual SNR curve oscillated around the threshold.  

In the ADRP-phase-retardation technique, a linear slope is fitted to the rising portion in a plot of phase 
retardation against depth. The residuals, threshold and fascicle boundary are then calculated in the same way as 
the  ADRP-structural-data  technique.  We  did  not  employ  the  ADRP  phase-retardation  technique  on  any  tissue 
samples as our system was not polarisation sensitive.

2.6 Autoregressive spectral estimation (AR-SE) technique  

 produced using Burg’s method, such that 

The  AR-SE  technique  for  estimating  scatterer  diameter  was  originally  presented  in  ref  [30]  and  then 
applied to biological samples, including the sciatic nerve of rabbit, in refs [19, 20]. The technique assumes a linear 
 and the eigenvectors produced by principal component analysis of 
relationship between the scatterer diameter 
 is a coefficient matrix 
the power spectral density 
which is populated using samples of known diameter, also called ‘training data’.  
𝐏𝐏xx� 𝐀𝐀� =  𝐝𝐝�

To  obtain  the  training  data,  we  used  the  three  microsphere  samples  described  above  (section  2.2).  A 
window 50 x 10 pixels (axial x transverse) in size was raster scanned across half of the OCT image at 25 and 1 
pixel steps respectively. Data was row-averaged to suppress noise and normalised to reduce variations from depth 
attenuation.  The  decay  of  reflection  coefficients  towards  zero  determined  the  autoregressive  order  to  use  in 
calculating the power  spectral density.  A  target  variance of 99.99% determined the  number of components to 
extract from weighted principal component analysis (PCA) of the power spectral density data. The remaining half 
of each OCT image of microspheres was used to obtain diameter estimates.

In applying the AR-SE technique to OCT data from tissue samples, larger window sizes reduced noise 
but potentially removes more of the targeted detail such as the intra-fascicle boundary and localised variation in 
fibre diameter distribution. Furthermore, the maximum autoregressive order that can be applied is one less than 
the number of data points, i.e. the axial window size. A window size of 10 x 10 pixels, scanned at 1 pixel steps, 
was selected as it produced a good balance between noise reduction and sufficient resolution. At each step, the 
autoregressive order to use was determined by analysing the reflection coefficients, with a drop below +/-0.1 in 
magnitude used as the threshold criterion. Alternatively, when the decay of reflection coefficients towards zero 
was not clearly identifiable, an autoregressive order of 3 was selected as this value  was common in the tissue 
samples and was found to minimise noise in the solution.

2.7 Correlation of the derivative spectral estimation (CoD-SE) technique  

The  CoD-SE  technique  was  originally  presented  in  ref  [24],  and  then  again  with  additional  signal 
processing steps in ref [21]. This technique uses Mie theory to generate spectra for spherical scatterers before 
taking the derivative and then the autocorrelation to produce the correlation of the derivative (CoD). The CoD 
bandwidth  is  calculated  as  the  first  minimum,  i.e.  the  minimum  with  the  lowest  lag  value,  in  the  CoD  of  the 
spectra.  A  curve  is  fitted  to  a  plot  of  the  theoretical  relationship  between  the  scatterer  diameter  and  CoD 
bandwidth. In OCT data, the spectra are obtained using the Fourier transform with a Gaussian window. In order 
to lower the noise, spectra are low pass filtered and the edges are removed. Differentiating with respect to the 
neighbouring  value  followed  by  autocorrelation  produces  the  CoD.  CoD-SE  is  highly  sensitive  to  the  lateral 
position of the window relative to the scatterer, and to the axial window size. To address the former, an intensity 
threshold of 5dB above the noise level is introduced and the highest intensity of 3 laterally adjacent windows is 
assigned to all 3 lateral positions. To address the latter, the axial window size, which is used to obtain sample 
spectra, is selected to minimise the standard deviation of the resulting scatterer diameter estimates.  

We appended an additional step to the end of the original method, outlined in the previous paragraph, in 
order improve the scatterer diameter estimates produced from our microsphere samples: the window axial size 
was selected to minimise the ‘normalised’ standard deviation of the scatterer diameter estimate, calculated as the 
standard deviation divided by the corresponding mean.  

The  CoD-SE  algorithm  was  tested  on  three  microsphere  samples  with  same  concentration  and  mean 
diameter as in the AR-SE experiments, see section 2.5. We generated the theoretical curve using the MATLAB 
functions of Mie theory presented in refs [31, 32] and refractive indices of water and polystyrene [33] (

 and 

 ). We then fitted an exponential function of the form

𝑓𝑓𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶
standard deviation of the Gaussian window in the Fourier transform, and 2) the extent to crop the edges of spectra 
to remove noise. A standard deviation of the Gaussian window equal to half of the window size, and cropping of 
3.9 nm (100/4096 points) from each end of the spectral range,  were selected through trial and error using the 
microsphere samples. Diameter estimates were produced for each image pixel using 13 different axial window 
sizes from 3 to 15 pixels, all with a lateral size of 1 pixel, scanned at 1 pixel steps. At each step, and for each 
window size, the Butterworth filter (2nd order, zero phase, low pass) cut-off frequency was selected using Winter’s 
method, with resulting values in the range 0.225 +/- 0.004 π.rad/sample (0.899 +/-0.016 nm-1).

For tissue samples, we could not find a value for the refractive index of endoneurium nor its close relative 
epineurium.  Instead,  we  used  bovine  tendon,  which  is,  like  endoneurium,  a  collagen  rich  connective  tissue. 
Therefore,  we  generated  the  theoretical  CoD  bandwidth  curve  using  refractive  indices  of  myelin  (

Axial  window  sizes  from  3  to  15  pixels  were  used  to  generate  diameter  estimates,  and  then  a  3  x  3  scanning

3 Results  

3.1 Epineurium thickness 

3.1.1 Histological analysis  

With  H&E  staining  the  fascicle,  boundaries  in  the  sciatic  branches  were  clearly  identifiable  in  light 
microscopy images of all three tissue samples by the change from dark pink stained epineurium and perineurium 
tissues to the lighter pink intra-fascicle environment mottled with unstained nerve fibres, Fig. 2. Adipose cells are 
unstained  by  H&E.  Adipose  tissue  commonly  appeared  in  clusters  of  several  cells,  each  with  a  diameter  of 
>20 µm,  apposed  to  the  nerve  outer  boundary  was  present  in  large  quantities  in  tissue  sample  1  and  in  small 
quantities in tissue samples 2 and 3, Fig 2. 

The combined epineurium and perineurium thickness was estimated as 50 +/- 38 µm, 45 +/- 32 µm and 
31 +/- 25 µm (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) across the entire light microscopy image for tissue samples 1, 2 and 
3 respectively.

Due  to  the  small  thickness  of  perineurium  relative  to  epineurium,  and  because  one  layer  of  each  are 
always present and adjacent to one another in the tissue layer separating the intra-fascicle volume and the outer 
nerve boundary, from here onwards we refer to the combined epineurium and perineurium tissue layer as just the 
epineurium layer.  

When the light microscopy images were aligned to the corresponding OCT image, and the middle 50% 
of  the  nerve  boundary  was  analysed  to  match  the  area  imaged  and  analysed  by  OCT,  the  localised  standard 
deviations  of  the  epineurium  thickness  estimates  were  smaller  than  those  obtained  for  the  entire  nerve.  This 
indicates epineurium thickness varies along the outer boundary. The distribution of the thickness estimates for 
tissue sample 1 orientation 3 and tissue sample 3 orientations 1 & 2 showed multiple peaks across the range of 
values, i.e. multimodal. All other tissue samples’ orientations were right skewed, i.e. favouring smaller thickness,

histological image were identified, shown with dashed lines in (b), and the middle 50% of the nerve boundary was 
assigned as the middle 50% in linear distance between the respective ends, shown with arrows in (b). Tissue features 
of peripheral nerve are labelled in (c). 

3.1.2 Average depth resolved profile (ADRP) techniques 

Using the conventional ADRP-structural-data method, to construct the ADRP from the middle 50% of 
A-scans, estimates of the combined epineurium thickness from all orientations of tissue samples 1 and 2 were 
consistently lower than results obtained from sciatic nerve presented in the original study for the ADRP-structural-
data  technique  of  133  +/-14  µm  [18].  Tissue  sample  3  is  from  the  tibial  nerve  branch  and  so  is  not  directly

tissue sample 1 orientation 3 and tissue sample 2 orientation 2 are within +1 standard deviation, and tissue sample 
3 orientation 4 within +2 standard deviations of the mean values provided by measurement from corresponding 
histology  by  light  microscopy.  The  remaining  estimates  are  greater  than  +  2  standard  deviations,  indicating 
significant disagreement between values, Table 1.  

Thickness  estimates  using  the  5  A-scan  sliding  window  method  were  consistently  lower  than  those 
obtained using the conventional ADRP method. Furthermore, with the exception of tissue sample 2 orientations 
2  and  3,  the  distribution  of  thickness  estimates  were  right  skewed,  i.e.  favouring  smaller  thickness.  With  the 
exception of Tissue sample 2 orientation 2, all estimates in Table 1 obtained using the ADRP-5Ascan method are 
within 1 standard deviation of the values obtained from light microscopy, however, the right skewed distributions 
of data make means a poor measure for comparison. The medians (Wilcoxen rank sum test, α = 0.05) and analysis 
of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test, α = 0.05) of estimates obtained with the ADRP-5Ascan from tissue sample 1 
orientation 3,  tissue sample 2 orientations 3 & 4, and tissue sample 3 orientations 2 & 3 were in agreement with 
the corresponding histology by light microscopy.  

3.1.3 Autoregressive spectral estimation (AR-SE) technique 

The layer of epineurium and perineurium tissues was visually identified as a contiguous area of large 
diameter scatterers along the surface of the nerve. The relationship between the thickness of this contiguous layer 
of scatterers and the thickness of the epineurium tissue was investigated using a digital phantom of an epineurium 
layer, which was constructed using a 50x50 element array with each element equal to 0.01 and within this array 
several adjacent rows containing values of 1 to mimic epineurium. Application of the AR-SE algorithm to the 
phantom showed the epineurium thickness along each A-scan could be approximated by difference between the 
base width of the contiguous scatterer peak and the window axial size. In nerve samples, due to the presence of

scatterers along the inside boundary of the epineurium tissue layer, we isolated the contiguous scatterer peak by 
removing scatterer estimates below 5 µm. We then subtracted the scanning window axial size from the full-width-
half-mean of the contiguous scatterer peak, in place of the base width, to estimate the epineurium thickness.  

Visual  identification  of  the  layer  epineurium  tissue,  as  a  contiguous  area  of  large  diameter  scatterers 
along the surface of the nerve, is an observation not reported in the original study. The distributions of thickness 
estimates produced with the AR-SE technique are generally right skewed with a long right-hand tail which makes 
the means a poor measure for comparison, Fig. 3. Indeed, none of the AR-SE thickness estimate means were in 
agreement with their corresponding histology by light microscopy (two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, α = 
0.05). Estimate medians (Wilcoxen rank sum test, α = 0.05) and analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test, α = 
0.05) of tissue sample 1 orientation 4, all orientations of tissue sample 2, and tissue sample 3 orientation  4 were 
in agreement with their corresponding histology by light microscopy.  
It is evident in box and whisker plots of AR-SE estimates in Fig. 3 that in all tissue samples and orientations there 
was at least one, and typically several, thickness estimates of 0 µm, which is biologically impossible.  

3.1.4 Correlation of the derivative spectral estimation (CoD-SE) technique 

Scatterer  diameter  estimates  produced  by  the  CoD-SE  algorithm  varied  depending  on  the  size  of  the 
square scanning window, with larger square windows favouring smaller mean diameter estimates with smaller 
standard deviations. An unbiased method of selecting this parameter is desirable for practical application of the 
CoD algorithm. On OCT data of nerve tissue, a contiguous layer of estimates within the range of 2.2 to 4 µm were 
produced  around  the  tissue  boundary  where  the  epineurium  layer  is  expected  to  reside.  Although  this  narrow 
diameter range may potentially provide a means to distinguish the epineurium layer from the adjacent air on one 
side and intra-fascicle volume on the opposing side, we did not identify a method to easily isolate this layer from 
scatterers present along its internal and external boundaries. In addition, we did not extract a relationship between 
this  contiguous  layer  and  the  epineurium  thickness  through  application  of  the  CoD-SE  algorithm  to  a  digital 
phantom of an epineurium layer. Therefore, we did not pursue epineurium thickness estimation with the CoD-SE 
technique further.

3.2 Fibre diameter distribution 

3.2.1 Histological Analysis  

Tissue sample 1 orientation 4 contained easily identifiable landmarks – in the form of two ‘humps’ – for 
alignment  to  corresponding  OCT  images,  and  contained  two  fascicles  with  a  difference  in  fibre  diameter 
distributions that was easily perceptible at 10x and 40x magnifications, Fig. 4a. Tissue sample 1 orientation 4 was

therefore selected for fibre diameter distribution analysis. A minor histological artefact is evident in this sample 
where the left fascicle has been pulled away from the right fascicle during slicing on the microtome, Box and 
whisker plots of the fibre diameter distributions within the left (grids 1 – 9) and right (grids 10 – 18) fascicles 
showed  higher  medians,  upper  and  lower  quartiles,  and  maximum  values  in  the  majority  of  grids  in  the  right 
fascicle compared to grids of the left fascicle, Fig. 4b. Further analysis, using one-way ANOVA with α = 0.05, 
revealed  significant  difference  between  the  means  of  grids  1  and  3  within  the  left  fascicle,  and  no  significant 
difference between the means of grids in the right fascicle. The left and right fascicles possessed diameters of 6.1 
+/-2.1 µm and 10.1 +/- 3.0 µm (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) respectively. One-way ANOVA, α = 0.05, also 
revealed  significant  difference  in  fibre  diameter  between  the  two  fascicles,  indicating  a  heterogeneous  fibre 
diameter distribution at the fascicle level.

The AR-SE technique estimated the diameters of microsphere samples of 3.8, 5.33, and 8.49 µm diameter 
as 3.6 +/- 0.90, 5.0 +/- 1.2, and 7.9 +/- 2.1 µm (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) respectively, Table 2. These results 
show a good diameter estimate accuracy (t-test, α = 0.05) but  with  high probability of large (>25%) errors in 
individual measurements.

On  OCT  data  from  tissue  sample  1  orientation  4,  the  AR-SE  technique  predicted  a  heterogeneous 
distribution  of  fibre  diameters  in  both  fascicles,  Fig.  5b.  A  small  difference  between  the  scatterer  diameter 
distributions in the left and right fascicles was predicted, with means of 7.6 and 8.1 µm respectively, table 2, and 
medians of 8.2 and 9.0 respectively, Fig 5c. The diameter distribution estimates were significantly different to 
those produced from the corresponding histology by light microscopy images (t-test, α = 0.05; and Wilcoxen rank 
sum test,  α = 0.05), Fig. 5c. Therefore, in the example analysis of this image, the  AR-SE technique correctly 
predicted a larger scatterer diameter distribution in the right fascicle but did not accurately quantify the difference 
between the two fascicles’ distributions.

by light microscopy in a box and whisker plot (c). The AR-SE technique correctly predicted a larger scatterer diameter 
distribution in the right fascicle but did not accurately quantify the difference between two fascicles’ distributions. 

3.2.3 Correlation of the derivative spectral estimation (CoD-SE) technique 

The CoD technique estimated the diameters of microsphere samples of 3.8, 5.33, and 8.49 µm diameter 
as 2.6 +/- 0.7, 2.8 +/- 0.5, and 4.5 +/- 0.3 µm (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) respectively, which indicates poor 
diameter  estimate  accuracy  for  all  microsphere  diameters,  Table  2.  All  estimates  corresponded  to  a  scanning 
window axial size of 4 pixels, selected to minimise the standard deviation, whereas the smallest window axial size 
used  in  the  original  study  was  5  pixels  [21].  Excluding  window  axial  sizes  of  3  pixels  and  4  pixels  from 
consideration provided a significant improvement in estimate accuracy: 4.3 +/- 1.5, 4.6 +/- 1.5, and 6.3 +/- 1.9 
µm respectively. For all microsphere samples, the magnitude of diameter estimates showed a decreasing trend 
with decreasing axial window size, as did the standard deviation of estimates, which results in smaller diameter 
estimates being favoured. Selection via minimisation of the normalised standard deviation removed the effect of 
the downwards trends, and, with window axial sizes of 3 pixels and 4 pixels excluded, increased the estimate for 
5.33 µm microspheres to 5.7 +/- 1.4 µm. Estimates for 3.8 and 8.49 µm microspheres remained unchanged, Table 
2.  

On  OCT  data  of  nerve  tissue,  pixels  containing  air  produced  an  estimate  of  1.775  µm,  which 
corresponded to a lag of 1500(a.u.) and was the limit of the power fit to the theoretical CoD curve. As mentioned 
earlier, in section 3.2.4, epineurium produced estimates within the range of 2.2 to 4 µm. Therefore, to remove air 
and epineurium, scatterer diameter estimates of less than or equal to 4 µm were discarded in our analysis of fibre 
diameter  distribution.  On  OCT  data  from  tissue  sample  1  orientation  4,  the  CoD-SE  algorithm  predicted  a 
heterogeneous  distribution  of  fibre  diameters  in  both  the  left  and  right  fascicles,  Fig.  6b.  A  small  difference 
between the scatterer diameter distributions in the left and right fascicles was predicted, with means of 10.4 and 
10.9 µm respectively, table 2, and medians of 10.0 and 10.6 µm respectively, Fig 6c. As for the AR-SE technique, 
the normalised CoD-SE technique correctly predicted a larger mean scatterer diameter in the right fascicle, but 
did not accurately quantify the difference.

correctly predicted a larger mean scatterer diameter in the right fascicle, but did not accurately quantify the difference. 

3.3 Adipose tissue identification 

3.3.1 Average depth resolved profile (ADRP) technique 

Using the 5 A-scan sliding window method and calculating the threshold from the entire portion of the 
residual SNR curve, regions with adipose tissue apposed to the outer nerve boundary cross the threshold several 
times throughout the depth, Fig. 7b. In contrast, regions with epineurium crossed the threshold only once Fig. 7a. 
Thus, layers of adipose tissue were qualitatively distinguishable from epineurium tissue, a finding not reported in 
the original study [18]. Further studies on this effect are needed to establish the repeatability of this observation. 
It was not possible to identify the outer epineurium boundary beneath adipose tissue, and, as a result, the thickness 
of adipose tissue could not be estimated, nor was it possible to identify the uniformly decaying region indicating 
the intra fascicle volume beneath adipose tissue. The presence of adipose tissue, therefore, reduces the amount of 
information available from the ADRP technique.

3.3.2 Autoregressive spectral estimation (AR-SE) technique 

Adipose  tissue  was  qualitatively  identified  within  the  AR-SE  technique  as  clusters  of  large  diameter 
scatterers present in areas of the image where the contiguous layer of scatterers on the nerve surface, characteristic 
of epineurium tissue, was absent. It was not possible to identify the boundary between epineurium and adjacent 
adipose tissue, and, as a result, the thickness of adipose tissue could not be estimated. A heterogeneous distribution 
of nerve  fibres could feasibly also appear as clusters of large  diameter scatterers. Thus,  it  was not possible to 
distinguish adipose tissue from the intra-fascicle volume. Similarities between AR-SE estimates of adipose tissue, 
epineurium,  and  heterogeneous  fibre  diameter  distribution  meant  adipose  tissue  could  not  be  identified  with 
confidence without referencing against the corresponding light microscopy images.  

3.3.3 Correlation of the derivative spectral estimation (CoD-SE) technique 

Adipose tissue appeared as a heterogeneous distribution of scatterers within the range of 2 – 19 µm. A 
method of distinguishing adipose tissue from intra-fasicle volume was not found. The 50 µm and greater size of 
adipose cells, observed in histology by light microscopy, is beyond the Mie scattering range and so their true size 
cannot be estimated using the CoD-SE technique.  

4 Discussion 

A  reference  value  for  the  combined  thickness  of  epineurium  and  perineurium  can  be  estimated  by 
summation of the epineurium thickness range in ref [8] of 47 +/-25 µm for Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350 to 
450 g, and the perineurium thickness range from ref [10] of 3 to 5 µm for Wistar rats weighing 200 to 250 g, 
producing a combined thickness of approximately 51 +/- 26 µm. This reference value is in broad agreement with 
the values we obtained from histology, of 50 +/- 38 µm, 45 +/- 32 µm (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) for tissue 
samples 1 and 2 respectively. The value for tissue sample 3, of 31 +/- 25 µm, is not directly comparable as it is 
from the tibial, not the sciatic, branch. It is evident from the size of the standard deviations, which are large relative 
to mean values in both ref [8] and our estimates, that there is a significant variation in epineurium and perineurium 
tissue thickness across the cross section of each tissue sample.  

When the ADRP was calculated using the middle 50% of A-scans, the technique produced estimates of 
epineurium thickness with an average of 86 µm, and which were consistently lower than those in the original 
paper, [18], which reported an average thickness of 133 µm on  sciatic nerve of Sprague-Dawley rats. Both of 
these values, 86 µm and 133 µm, are significantly above our reference value of 51 +/- 26 µm [8, 10]. In addition, 
all of the epineurium thickness estimates we produced using this technique were consistently and significantly 
larger than the corresponding estimates using histology by light microscopy. The technique, therefore, appears to 
consistently and significantly overestimate the epineurium thickness. Accuracy of epineurium thickness estimates 
using the ADRP technique were significantly improved through the addition to the method of a scanning window 
containing 5 adjacent A-scans. The 5 Ascan ADRP technique also resolves the image with a higher transverse 
resolution, which is beneficial to practical application of the technique due to the variable epineurium thickness 
observed in the histology by  light  microscopy.  A qualitative  method of identifying adipose tissue through the 
residual SNR is a new application of the ADRP technique. However, further studies are required to evaluate the 
repeatability of the proposed method. 

Use of the structural and optical differences  within the peripheral nerve to estimate epineurium layer 
thickness is a novel application of scatterer diameter estimation techniques, such as AR-SE and CoD. In the AR-
SE technique, our observation of epineurium as a contiguous layer of large diameter scatterers presents a new 
means to identify the epineurium boundary. Our initial results of thickness estimates, using the difference between 
the full-width-half-mean of the contiguous scatterer peak and the axial scanning window size, are very promising. 
However,  the  accuracy  of  thickness  estimates  were  significantly  reduced  by  the  inability  of  the  technique  to 
distinguish between the tissue layer and large diameter nerve fibres apposed to the inner tissue boundary, which, 
accordingly, inflates the affected tissue thickness estimates. In addition, the tendency of the AR-SE algorithm to 
produce some thickness estimates of 0 µm, which is biologically impossible, raises the question of robustness of 
using the full-width-half-mean of the contiguous scatterer peak as an estimate of the base-width. Further studies 
on the relationship between the contiguous scatterer layer and epineurium thickness are needed.  

In the CoD-SE technique the epineurium tissue layers were visually identified as a contiguous layer of 
scatterers, however, a method to isolate this layer and a quantitative method to analyse the thickness were not 
identified in the current study. Application of the CoD-SE technique to estimating epineurium thickness from the 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
13 

contiguous layer is expected to suffer from the same problem identified in the AR-SE technique: an inability to 
distinguish epineurium tissue from clusters of fibres adjacent to the internal tissue boundary. This inability appears 
to be an inherent shortfall in the application of scatterer diameter estimation techniques to distinguishing tissue 
layers. 

Differences in fibre diameter distribution between fascicles were correctly identified by both the AR-SE 
and normalised CoD-SE techniques, however, the magnitude of this difference was not estimated accurately by 
either technique. In the AR-SE technique, we postulate that the estimate accuracy may be improved through the 
use of  more biomimetic  samples to populate the coefficient  matrix  within the  algorithm. However, producing 
samples  which  mimic  densely  packed  nerve  fibres  within  the  intra  fascicle  volume  using  materials  with 
comparable refractive indices poses a challenge. Alternatively, spectral data gathered from fascicles of known 
fibre diameter distribution could be used to train the algorithm. Conversely, because the CoD-SE technique uses 
a Mie theory based model to predict the spectra, the challenge lies in locating suitable values for the refractive 
indices of the biological tissue and cellular layers. Furthermore, the myelinated fibre contains an internal scattering 
boundary  between  the  myelin  sheath  and  intracellular  fluid  of  the  axon  which  has  not  been  considered  in  the 
current study.  

In all techniques, inaccuracy was compounded by the low axial resolution of our OCT system (10 µm in 
air) relative to the lower bounds of epineurium tissue layer thickness (10 µm) present in some areas of each tissue 
sample. None of the techniques could identify the epineurium boundaries beneath adipose tissue or on the far side 
of the intra-fascicle volume. Therefore, application of the techniques appears to be limited in depth, perhaps to as 
little as the first 100 – 200 µm, due to limitations of the techniques and to the highly scattering nature of adipose 
tissue and nerve fibres. This is in broad agreement with an observation by authors of the original ADRP technique 
[18], performed on an OCT system with 11 µm axial resolution in air, that the ADRP technique is unreliable at 
greater than 300 µm depth due to a decrease in the SNR. The authors of the original AR-SE technique, performed 
on an OCT system with 13 µm axial resolution in air, qualitatively implied the presence of three fascicles within 
an OCT image of a peripheral nerve at depths of up to 500 µm [19], although, as the authors point out, without 
any  validation.  Several  100’s  of  µm  depth  penetration  is  sufficient  to  image  the  minor  branches  of  the  major 
nerves in humans, such as the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, and digital branches of the median nerve [9]. 
Furthermore, some medical applications, such neural tissue identification as an aid to surgery [11], do not require 
significant  depth  penetration,  whereas  others,  such  as  monitoring  of  epineurium  thickness  in  response 
implantation of nerve-cuff electrodes [34], or monitoring of myelination post crush injury [17], may garner useful 
information from the outer layers of the nerve alone. The principal advantage of OCT in extracting morphometric 
information from peripheral nerve is the wealth of information present in the OCT signal. As was the case in the 
current study, several signal processing techniques can be applied to a single set of OCT data, obtained from each 
nerve,  in  order  to  extract  multiple  morphometric  details  such  as  epineurium  thickness  (ADRP  and  AR-SE 
techniques), fibre diameter distribution (AR-SE and CoD techniques), and tissue classification (ADRP technique). 
Variation of morphometric details along the length of the nerve could then be easily be accomplished by using C-
scans.  

5 Conclusion 

Three OCT signal analysis techniques were evaluated and improved upon in this study as a means to 
extract  morphometric  details  of  peripheral  nerves.  New  methods  of  estimating  the  epineurium  thickness  were 
identified, and initial accuracy of results are promising. Further development of these techniques and the use of 
higher resolution OCT system are expected to improve the accuracy. Methods of quantifying the fibre diameter 
distribution  were  not  successfully  produced,  however,  factors  that  potentially  improve  the  methods  were 
identified. This study has characterised some of the abilities and limitations of OCT in extracting morphometric 
information of peripheral nerve and identified future research directions in this area.
