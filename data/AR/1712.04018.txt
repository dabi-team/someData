Strangeness Production in low energy Heavy Ion Collisions via Hagedorn Resonances

Max-von-Laue-Str. 1, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany

Background: Statistical models are successfully used to describe particle multiplicities in (ultra-)relativistic
heavy ion collisions. Transport models usually lack to describe special aspects of the results of these experiments,
as the fast equilibration and some multiplicity ratios.

Purpose: A novel, unorthodox picture of the dynamics of heavy ion collisions is developed using the concept of
Hagedorn states.

Method: A prescription of the bootstrap of Hagedorn states respecting the conserved quantum numbers baryon
number B, strangeness S, isospin I is implememted into the GiBUU transport model.

Results: Using a strangeness saturation suppression factor suitable for nucleon-nucleon-collisions, recent exper-
imental data for the strangeness production by the HADES collaboration in Au+Au and Ar+KCl is reasonable
well described. The experimental observed exponential slopes of the energy distributions are nicely reproduced.

Conclusions: A dynamical model using Hagedorn resonance states, supplemented by a strangeness saturation
suppression factor, is able to explain essential features (multiplicities, exponential slope) of experimental data for
strangeness production in nucleus-nucleus collisions close to threshold.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Statistical models are considered to be a valuable tool
to understand the properties of the matter generated in
(ultra-)relativistic heavy ion collisions [1–3], but also in
high energetic e+e−, pp and pp collisions [4].

On the other hand, starting with Fermi’s statistical
model [5], ﬁreball models were applied successfully for the
description of experimental data in nucleon-antinucleon
annihilation events at low energies. With the invention
of the statistical bootstrap model (SBM) by Hagedorn
[6] and its microcanonical reformulation by Frautschi
[7] a systematical and consistent way for the inclusion
of higher mass resonances was formulated. Hamer was
the ﬁrst to apply the (microcanonical) SBM to nucleon-
antinucleon collisions [8] (see also [9, 10] for recent re-
views).

→

1 and 1

In refs. [11–13] the authors developed a prescription of
a microcanonical bootstrap of Hagedorn states with the
explicitly conserved quantum numbers baryon number B,
strangeness S and charge Q. The covariant formulation
is analogous to [8, 14]. Due to the restriction to only
two constituents, a simple picture of creation and de-
cay of Hagedorn states as 2
2 processes
could be formulated on the basis of detailed balance.
This allows for dynamical calculations, and the model
was successfully implemented into the hadronic trans-
port model UrQMD[15, 16]. It has been shown in a ﬁrst
step, that from the Hagedorn model alone hadron mul-
tiplicities from cascading decay chains of a single heavy
Hagedorn state are close to experimental data and that
the energy spectra of the resulting hadrons from these
decays follow an exponential law and thus look thermal
by itself. Secondly, by performing box calculations, a de-
sired fast equilibration time of strange and multistrange
baryons and mesons was extracted.

→

Unfortunately, the numerical eﬀort for these processes

is quite high and especially the calculation of the decay
of a Hagedorn state becomes slow when the mass of the
resonance increases. An alternative prescription using
isospin, I, instead of charge, Q, is presented here and
allows for much faster calculations. Therefore, for the
ﬁrst time, dynamical calculations of heavy ion collisions
become feasible. Here now the transport model GiBUU
[17] is used. This presents a new, unorthodox picture of
the microscopical processes of the dynamics of heavy ion
collisions. It has to be confronted against experimental
ﬁndings and also against results of traditional transport
calculations.
In this pioneering and exploratory work
the production of φ mesons in low energetic heavy ion
collisions will be used as the test ground.

Recently, the HADES Collaboration has studied the
role of the φ meson for the production of K − mesons
in Ar+KCl collisions at a kinetic beam energy of
1.756 AGeV [18] and in Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV
[19, 42], covering the region √sN N = 2.4
2.6 GeV.
Their data are compatible with former results by other
experiments. The measured φ/K − ratio was found to
25 % of the K −
be 0.4
originate from decays of φ mesons. The spectra of the
produced particles are thermal with slope parameters
Teﬀ = 70
100 MeV. Traditional transport models have
problems explaining theses ﬁndings.

It has to be noted that the idea of using higher mass
resonances as a possible explanation of the above men-
tioned HADES data was already used in ref. [20]. Con-
trary to that work, the present approach represents a
consistent way for the introduction of higher mass reso-
nances.

The transport model GiBUU has been used for a long
time to study low energetic heavy ion collisions [21] and
strangeness production therein [22, 23]. It was also used
for understanding production of hypernuclei in heavy ion
collisions and antiproton induced reactions (see [24] for

 
 
 
 
 
 
a recent survey). The interaction of the φ meson with
hadronic matter has been studied in the case of photoab-
sorption on nuclei [25, 26]. In addition, the hadronic reso-
nance model of GiBUU has been tested against dilepton
measurements of many experiments, especially against
HADES measurements of proton induced events, C+C
collisions at 1 and 2 AGeV and the (above mentioned)
Ar+KCl at 1.76 AGeV [27, 28]. It has to be mentioned,
that the prescription of Kaon production in p+p colli-
sions in GiBUU has recently been improved to match
experimental data of the HADES group [29].

The paper is organized as follows: In section II the
mayor equations for the actual bootstrap model are
shortly given and the overlap and the diﬀerences to
previous work is indicated. The implementation of a
strangeness saturation suppression factor is described.
Then, in section III, results from the present calculations
are compared with experimental data from the HADES
collaboration for A+A collisions. In a ﬁrst step, only to-
tal particle multiplicities are considered, while in a sec-
ond step, also energy spectra of particles are compared.
Finally, conclusions are drawn in section IV.

II. MODEL

Hagedorn states are hadron-like resonances, which are
not limited to quantum numbers of known hadrons and
also can be much heavier than known resonances. In the
presented approach, these states are characterized by the
quantum numbers baryon number (B), strangeness (S)
and isospin (I). Instead of the latter, also the electrical
charge (Q) could be used.

In the following a microscopic and dynamic descrip-
tion is provided of how a hadron resonance gas could
be consistently expanded by Hagedorn states. Hagedorn
state creation from two hadrons, their interaction with
hadrons and other Hagedorn states and ﬁnally their de-
cay into hadrons and/or other Hagedorn states are devel-
oped in a microcanonical way by respecting all the above
given quantum numbers explicitly in each step. All this
can be implemented into the transport model GiBUU[17],
replacing most of its default interactions. Also, the re-
sulting mass degeneracies can be used to enrich thermal
model prescriptions by Hagedorn states, as in [30, 31].
Actually, the used prescription is a close extension of
[32, 33].

for indicating, that the summation just runs over the
quantum number combinations, which are compatible
with the overall quantum numbers.

In the case of additive discrete quantum numbers, as
e.g. baryon number B, strangeness S, and charge Q, the
“generalized” delta symbol δ(z; x, y) in eq. (5) is the usual
one,

δ(X; X1, X2) = δX,X1+X2 for X = B, S, Q, . . .

. (6)

This set of quantum numbers (B, S, Q) was used in
[11, 12], where the model was implemented into the
hadronic transport model UrQMD [15, 16]. This imple-
mentation has been shown to be rather ineﬀective and

slow in computation time. Therefore the set of quantum
numbers (B, S, I) with I standing for the isospin will be
used in present work.

The Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula (2Iz = 2Q

S)
connects the charge Q (for known B and S) with the
z-component of the isospin, Iz, not with the isospin, I,
directly. Therefore, the corresponding Clebsch Gordan
coeﬃcients have to be respected in the “generalized” δ-
symbol in eq. (5),

While thus the equations look more diﬃcult, the actual
calculation is much faster, because the number of possi-
ble quantum number combinations to consider is much
smaller.

It has been tested, that both approaches, i.e. the new
(B, S, I) and the former (B, S, Q) approach, give the
same results, when the quantum numbers are identical.
This needs some rework, since if the quantum numbers
are ﬁxed e.g. to some values of (B, S, Q), one has to
iterate in the (B, S, I) approach over all states, which
may contribute to the given state. From the Gell-Mann–
Nishijima formula we get some Iz value, which indicates
the minimal I value of the iteration.

The presented prescription preserves quantum num-
bers in a microcanonical sense such that some quantum
numbers are conserved explicitly. Unfortunately, some
other quantities are not preserved. So the G-parity is
violated; processes like 2π
3π are possible. This
→
may have direct consequences on the number of produced
particles. Such considerations are left for further studies.
In the large mass region (m & 3 GeV), the resulting
mass degeneracy can be ﬁtted very well with a function
including an exponential increase,

quantum numbers ~C. The parameter c depends only
very weakly [11–13]; it is assigned with the label “Hage-
1/c ~C. Usually, this notion
dorn temperature”, TH, ~C ≡
is connected with the temperature of the system, where
the partition function diverges. Since the present model
is constraint in the bootstrap to some maximal mass
(m < 10 GeV) for the Hagedorn states due to numer-
ical reasons, the actual divergence can not fully been
observed. Therefore only an approximate value of the
Hagedorn temperature derived from the ﬁts according
eq. (8) can be given, TH =
, were the averaging is
done over all possible quantum number states ~C.

The only free parameter of the presented statistical
bootstrap is the radius parameter R, which enters eqs. (1)
and (2) as the volume V of the Hagedorn state and as the
production cross section σ. But it also directly inﬂuences
the slopes of the spectra and is thus directly connected

3

with the value of the Hagedorn temperature TH. In the
present work, a ﬁxed value R = 1.0 fm is chosen, yielding
σ = 31 mb, V = 4.2 fm3, and a Hagedorn temperature
165 MeV. Due to numerical reasons, we have to
TH ∼
restrict to masses m < 10 GeV in the bootstrap.

B. Phase space diagram

As in [32, 33], the calculated Hagedorn spectra may
be included into a statistical model with baryo-chemical
potential µB and strange potential µS. As mentioned
above one normally connects the notion of a Hagedorn
temperature with that temperature, where the partition
function diverges.
In order to illustrate this behavior,
the divergence of the energy density as function of the
temperature is shown in ﬁg. 1. Here results for vanishing

vanishing baryo-chemical potential the curve starts to in-
crease very rapidly close to the ﬁtted TH above, the di-
vergence occurs for large values of µB at clearly smaller
temperatures. Again, if in the present model Hagedorn
masses would not be limited, the divergence would be
much sharper.

This is shown in ﬁg. 2, where the mass spectrum yielding

for the latter condition the spectrum seems to increase
with increasing mass, yielding deﬁnitely a diverging par-
tition sum.

For the case of a large value of the baryo-chemical
potential µB, the situation is diﬀerent. The connected
temperature leading to a divergence is much smaller
(
75 MeV, see ﬁg. 1), yielding slopes, which drop very
∼
fast with increasing mass, when the net baryon number
is ﬁxed. The large factor eB µB /T enhances more and
more particles with larger baryon numbers. Finally, in
the limit of vanishing temperature but maximal baryo-
chemical potential, the mass distribution would consist
of a sum of equipotent, rather spiky functions, located
at multiples of the nucleon mass mN = 0.938 GeV. This
is clearly and prominently visible in ﬁg. 3. Obviously,
only particles with B
8 are considered in the present
prescription. Nevertheless, this constraint does not in-
ﬂuence the results. E.g., the inclusion of baryon num-
bers reduced by 1 only shifts the divergence region by

2 MeV.

(T < 25 MeV) are excluded from this consideration, since
here the Bose- or Fermi-nature of the particles become
important. As also shown in this ﬁgure, the treatment
of the strange chemical potential is only of minor im-
portance for this boundary. In addition, the boundary
is compared with the freeze-out parametrization from
[2, 34]. While for small values of the baryo-chemical
potential, the two curves lie on top of each other, the
boundary of the Hagedorn scenario reaches larger values
of µB for a given temperature.

 
 
 
C. Strangeness saturation suppression factor and
N+N collisions

It is well known, that statistical models, including the
SBM, yield too large multiplicities of strangeness carry-
ing particles compared to data of the annihilation exper-
iments [8](and references therein). Dynamical suppres-
sion according the OZI rule [35] could be an explanation.
Therefore, in the following, a strangeness saturation
suppression factor γs is implemented by rescaling the
cross section (and via the detailed balance constraint also
the decay width) by a ’penalty’ factor γ2
s , if the creation
or deletion of a ss quark pair is involved. This can be
formulated by the replacement

σ(m)

−→

σ(m) γ|S1|+|S2|−|S1+S2|

s

,

(9)

in eq. (2), where S1,2 is the strangeness content of the
two incoming/outgoing particles. A closer inspection of
this equation and eqs. (1) and (2) shows, that (when
the inhomogenity τ 0 can be neglected) this rescaling of
the cross section σ is equivalent to a rescaling of the τ
itselves,

τ ~C (m)

−→

τ ~C (m) γ|S|

s

.

(10)

Note that this rescaling should happen after the boot-
strap, but before calculating Γ.

Also processes deleting or producing a φ meson have
to get some ’penalty’ factor γφ, since the φ meson has
some ss quark content, while its overall strangeness is
zero. In the following, the simplest assumption, γφ = γ2
s ,
will be choosen. The inclusion of this factor has to be
done independent of the treatment eq. (9) resp. eq. (10)
in some additional, separate step.

A diﬀerent approach would already rescale the τ 0
ac-
~C
cording the prescription eq. (10) before the bootstrap. It
has been tested, that this approach would yield similar
results like shown below for the case for A+A collisions.
Nevertheless, the thermodynamical limit would yield a
diﬀerent asymptotic state than given here. Therefore this
approach is not followed here.

It has to be noted, that the dynamical approach de-
scribed here is close to the thermal description described
in ref. [4]: a microcanonical suppression in addition to a
dynamical strangeness suppression factor γs.

In order to adjust the value of γs, experimental data
for strangeness production in low energetic p+p collisions
is considered (data compilations [36, 37]). A comparison
of calculations doing Monte Carlo decays of a Hagedorn
state with the quantum numbers (B, S, I) = (2, 0, 1) and
the additional constraint Q = 2 with the experimental
data is shown in ﬁg. 5. As a ’ﬁt-by-eye’, the value γs =
0.3 will be used in this work. This value is compatible
with ref. [4], where the energy dependence for energies
larger than considered here shows a linear increase.

As can be seen in ﬁg. 5, the charged hadron (mainly pi-
ons) multiplicity is slightly underestimated directly at the
threshold, but somewhat overestimated for √s > 3 GeV.

tal data from p+p collisions as function of √s (data
compilation:[36, 37]). The strangeness suppression is γs =
0.3.

This behavior is hardly inﬂuenced by the choice of the
γs value. Also the excitation function of K + and Λ + Σ0
is only described well in the overall view; in the details
diﬀerences are visible. Unfortunately, data for K − multi-
plicities is not available in the region below 5 GeV, thus
no conclusion about the quality of the theoretical pre-
scription can be drawn.

The implemented strangeness suppression factor γs is
directly responsible for the multiplicity of the K + mesons
and the Λ and Σ baryons. On the other hand, the yield of
the K − mesons is connected with the yield of φ mesons.
Here, the above mentioned factor γφ is responsible via
the connection γφ = γ2
s .

It has been checked, that the description of the nega-
tively charged hadrons in p+n is similar to the shown case
here; underestimation directly at the threshold, while for
larger energies the data is overestimated.

As a note, another source of adjustment could be the
large number of experimental observables, especially all
the diﬀerent ﬁnal state channels in nucleon-antinucleon
annihilation. Nevertheless, there the situation is much
diﬀerent, since due to the diﬀerent total baryon number,
the production channels for mesons are already open at
threshold. Therefore these data are not really applica-
ble to the calculation of heavy ion collisions, where also
the baryon number plays a very import role. Thus the
annihilation data will not be used here.

The A+A collisions discussed in this work cover the

region √sN N = 2.4

2.6 GeV.

III. A+A COLLISIONS

In the following, heavy ion collisions are performed in
the framework of GiBUU[17]. The colliding nuclei are
initialized consisting of a given number of protons and
neutrons. The nucleons have Fermi momentum and are
bound in a potential. At initial time t = 0, the nuclei
are initialized with a necessary distance away from each
other and then propagating onto each other. Central-
ity/impact parameter constraints are implemented ac-
cording the experimental needs [19, 38, 42]. When not
stated otherwise, usual collisions are replaced by the for-
mation of Hagedorn states in this work.

Contrary to the usual prescription, Hagedorn states
can be formed by a ﬁrst N+N collision, but then also
gather additional energy by picking up a second nucleon.
Thus, the Hagedorn states can act as some kind of ’energy
reservoir’.

In order to illustrate this Hagedorn state scenario at
work, the mass distribution of Hagedorn states at a some
ﬁxed times for Au(1.23 AGeV)Au collisions is shown in
ﬁg. 6. The maximal overlap of the colliding nuclei hap-

pens at t = 12.0 fm. Thus the maximal mass extend
of the generated Hagedorn states is approximately 3 fm
after this point.

It is a remarkable feature, that very high mass states
are populated. The distribution is very smooth in its
maximal extend. Before and after this time, sharp struc-
tures are visible. At the beginning, Hagedorn states are
being built up by 2, 3, . . . nucleons. These nucleons
have approximately the same energy, therefore multiples
of the initial kinetic energy governs the mass distribution
of the Hagedorn states. When decays of the Hagedorn
states set in, then the mass of the nucleons is the rel-
evant scale. Then, again sharp structures in the mass

distribution develop, but now diﬀerent from the initial
ones.

The time evolution of states with diﬀerent baryon num-
bers is illustrated in ﬁg. 7. A similar picture as ﬁg. 7 for

A. Multiplicites

The transport model GiBUU features two diﬀerent
kinds of calculation setups. In the ﬁrst one, called ’paral-
lel ensemble’, multiple ensembles are calculated in paral-
lel, without any interference. The number of testparticles
is unity; this setup is a microcanonical one. The other
setup, called ’full ensemble’, mixes all ensembles and thus
the number of testparticles equals the number of ensem-
bles. Therefore, this is a (grand)canonical setup. This is
of importance for the production and absorption of rare
particles [39, 40].

In ﬁg. 8, the calculated multiplicities are compared
with experimental data for Au(1.23 AGeV)Au (0-40 %)
[19, 42] and Ar(1.76 AGeV)KCl (min. bias) [18]. An ef-
fect of the microcanonical treatment is visible, since the
multiplicities of the rare particles are even more sup-
pressed than in the canonical treatment. Nevertheless,
the φ multiplicities come out too high in the calculations,
inﬂuencing the K − in the same manner. The eﬀect is
larger at the smaller energy. For the higher energy, the
multiplicity of the K − is described very reasonable. The
s and Λ + Σ0 are described
multiplicities of π−, K +, K 0
well where measured. The visible overestimation for the

φ meson yields will be further discussed below when the

One observes, that the K − are strongly produced via
φ decays; the calculated φ/K − ratio is in the order of
80 % (cf. table I). It is important to keep in mind, that

The φ mesons are only produced via Hagedorn res-
onance decays into a φ meson and a hadron/Hagedorn
state, while approximately 33 % of all produced φ is re-
absorbed again. Here 60 % of all interactions (produc-
tion and reabsorption) are governed by B = 1 Hagedorn
states. All states with higher baryon number contribute,
while B = 7 is only weaker by 20 % than B = 2 (reab-
sorption factor is constant for all B). Comparing these
numbers with ﬁg. 7, one ﬁnds a non-trivial dependency
of φ production on the baryon number of the Hagedorn
states.

B. Traditional Transport (GiBUU)

In order to digest the eﬀects of the Hagedorn states,
the same calculations have been performed using the de-
fault interaction scenario implemented in GiBUU. Here,
no modiﬁcations for better descriptions of experimental
date have been adopted. The equation of state etc. is kept
as its default. As mentioned above, GiBUU was earlier
used to study strangeness production in more detail, see
especially ref. [29].

The comparison of the resulting multiplicities with ex-
perimental ones is shown in ﬁg. 9. The agreement be-
tween calculations and experiment is as good as within
the Hagedorn approach. One signiﬁcant diﬀerence is ob-
servable: In the default GiBUU approach, the φ/K − ra-
0.1) than in the Hagedorn ap-
tio is much smaller (
0.8), see table I. In addition, the K − mul-
proach (
tiplicities in the Hagedorn and in the GiBUU default
approach are more or less identical, but only the origin
of these mesons is diﬀerent. Thus, within the hadronic
treatment of GiBUU, the K − are not mainly generated
via φ decays.

In this pure hadronic treatment, approximately 60 % of
all produced φ mesons will be reabsorbed, mainly due to
N φ
N ππ processes. For this process, the parametriza-
tions by Golubeva et al. [41] are used in GiBUU, see
e.g. [25, 26]. At low energies, this cross section be-
comes larger than the (constant) cross section used in
the Hagedorn picture. The main production mechanisms
for φ production are the channels πρ

look at the energy spectra dN/pEdE

ical statistic do not allow for reasonable ﬁt values for
the theoretical curves. The calculated spectra follow ex-
tremely well exponential slopes of a thermal source, ex-
cept for the pions. Here some excess for low energies
is given, which may be due to the contributions of pi-
ons stemming from hadronic decays and additional ﬂow
eﬀects.

experimental ones. The calculated and the experimental
spectra for the K + agree prominently well. The com-
parison for the K − (and even more for the φ mesons)
is complicated by the statistical ﬂuctuations, both of ex-
perimental data and calculated results.

The resulting spectra from the GiBUU default sce-
nario, cf. ﬁg. 11, show up to be diﬀerent: the slope pa-
rameter of the K + is larger (

of the K − is smaller (

spectra looking quite similar can lead to ﬁtted slope pa-
rameters diﬀeringy by tens of MeV.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper, a consistent way of

includ-
ing heavy resonances via Hagedorn resonances into the
hadronic transport model GiBUU is presented and used
for the ﬁrst time for a full dynamical microscopical cal-
culations of heavy ion collisions. Hagedorn states im-
plement multi-baryonic (and highly unstable) states as
’energy reservoirs’. The resonances are constructed ac-
cording a ’microcanonical’ bootstrap with explicit conser-
vation of baryon number, strangeness and isospin. One
single parameter, the radius of one such Hagedorn state,
governs the full prescription. It is chosen such, that the
mass degeneration spectra exhibit an exponential slope
165 MeV. In addition, this
with a slope parameter TH ≃
parameter also ﬁxes the production cross section of Hage-
1 processes and, via detailed balance,
dorn states in 2
also the decay width for the decays 1
2. These pro-
cesses replace the conventional hadronic interactions and
thus present a new unorthodox picture for production
and absorption of hadrons.

→

→

In order to compare this scenario with experimental
multiplicities of charged particles in nucleon-nucleon col-
lisions, a strangeness suppression factor γs has to be in-
duced. Here a good overall agreement can be achieved.

This transport model is applied to A+A collisions in
the region of √sN N ≃
2.5 GeV as measured by the
HADES collaboration. The resulting multiplicities of pi-
ons and strange hadrons are in good agreement. Special
consideration has to be done for the φ meson. Here the
yields comes out too large. Nevertheless, one observes
that the production of K − mesons is mainly governed by
the decay of the φ meson, which can be quantiﬁed by a
φ/K −
0.8 ratio. This is higher than the experimental
≃
observed value.

The slopes of the mT -spectra are nicely reproduced for
K +, K − and φ mesons. The contribution of φ decays to
the K − spectra is important.

In order to test theses ﬁndings, also calculations with
the default hadronic treatment of the GiBUU transport
code are performed. The resulting multiplicities are
nearly identical to those within the Hagedorn treatment.
Again, the φ meson plays a special role.
In the tradi-
tional hadronic picture, the yield of φ meson is clearly
underestimated. Nevertheless, since the K − yields are
the same, one clearly observes, that in this picture, the
production mechanism of the K − meson is diﬀerent. The

experimental φ/K − is underestimated.

Also the slopes of the K + and the K − are not so well
reproduced. While the K + come out steeper than in the
Hagedorn picture, the K − slope parameter is larger.

It would thus be instructive to study in a next step
the thermodynamical evolution of the collision system in
both prescriptions and check the degree of thermalization
reached. Temperature proﬁles in space and time could
be easily extracted by reporting the actual values of the
energy momentum tensor. This is left for future studies.
It has to be checked, whether a larger radius of the
Hagedorn state, yielding a lower Hagedorn temperature
TH, would also yield lower slope parameters of the spec-
tra in these A+A collisions. This could be connected
then with the averaged number of pions in N+N anni-
hilations at rest, which comes a little bit too low in the
present prescription at the moment. All these studies will
be necessary for tests of the applicability of the Hagedorn
picture to systems with vanishing baryo-chemical poten-
tial as e.g. the matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy
ion collisions.

A statistical bootstrap model,

embedded into a
(hadronic) transport model is thus a valuable tool to
study not only very energetic, ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions, but also the behavior in such collisions at low
energies. By providing a total diﬀerent production mech-
anism for strange particles it supplements thus a usual
treatment and thus provides new insights into the prop-
erties of the produced matter in these collisions.

An extension of the given picture would allow in the
ﬁeld of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions for the study
of production of heavier quark states as e.g. charm or also
the production of light nuclei like deuterons, tritons etc..
Furthermore, with a bootstrap picture of color neutral
heavy states from the partonic side, a real microscopic
picture of the phase transition of a partonic system to a
pure hadronic system via Hagedorn resonances could be
developed.
