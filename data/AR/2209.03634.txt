ABSTRACT

After becoming ionized, low density astrophysical plasmas will begin a process of slow recombination.
Models for this still have signiﬁcant uncertainties. The recombination cannot normally be observed in
isolation, because the ionization follows the evolutionary time scale of the ionizing source. Laboratory
experiments are unable to reach the appropriate conditions because of the required very long time
scales. The extended nebula around the very late helium ﬂash (VLTP) star V4334 Sgr provides a
unique laboratory for this kind of study. The sudden loss of the ionizing UV radiation after the VLTP
event has allowed the nebula to recombine free from other inﬂuences. More than 290 long slit spectra
taken with FORS1/2 at the ESO VLT between 2007 and 2022 are used to follow the time evolution
of lines of H, He, N, S, O, Ar. Hydrogen and helium lines, representing most of the ionized mass, do
not show signiﬁcant changes. A small increase is seen in [N II] (+2.8 % yr−1; signiﬁcance 2.7 σ), while
we see a decrease in [O III] (-1.96 % yr−1; 2.0 σ). The [S II] lines show a change of +3.0 % yr−1; 1.6
σ). The lines of [S III] and of [Ar III] show no signiﬁcant change. For [S III], the measurement diﬀers
from the predicted decrease by 4.5σ. A possible explanation is that the fraction of [S IV] and higher
is larger than expected. Such an eﬀect could provide a potential solution for the sulfur anomaly in
planetary nebulae.

1. INTRODUCTION

When the UV radiation which photo-ionizes a nebula
ceases, the ions begin to recombine. This is an impor-
tant process in photoionized nebulae with typical densi-
ties of a few tens to a few hundred particles cm−3, where
the slow recombination leaves the nebula out of equilib-
rium. These conditions exist in low density H II regions,

in planetary nebulae and in nebulae around post com-
mon envelope binaries of the BE UMa family. Recombi-
nation at these low densities is not well studied, neither
in astrophysical environments nor in the laboratory.

Laboratory studies aim to measure the eﬀects directly.
But appropriate density and excitation conditions are
diﬃcult to reach. The leading edge experiment Cryo-
genic Storage Ring (CSR) has recently reached particle
densities down to 140 cm−3 (Kreckel et al. 2019).
In
order to keep the free ﬂight time (avoiding wall inter-
action) larger than the ion lifetimes, temperatures of
a few Kelvin are used. This is suitable for simulating
conditions of cold molecular clouds in the interstellar
medium (ISM). However, these have very low ioniza-
tion levels. Ionized nebulae have typical temperatures

of Te (cid:39) 10 000 K. As then the mean free path of particles
reaches thousands of kilometers, chamber wall interac-
tion would dominate laboratory experiments.

Astrophysical targets are needed for the determination
of the recombination timescales under these conditions,
and for the veriﬁcation of theoretical models. While
ionization happens on timescales of the light travel time
through the nebulae and thus within weeks or months,
recombination happens very slowly (Sch¨onberner 2008;
Balick et al. 2021). The latter authors estimate that the
expected recombination rate of the mono-atomic gas per
ion is

Rrec = 105yr/(Z 2ne),

(1)

where Z is the ionic charge and ne is the electron density.
These calculations are based on a mono-atomic gas in
a two-level approximation (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006)
and assume that the ion is in the ground state. The
latter assumption holds only for H, He and noble gases,
where the ﬁrst excitation level is at > 10 eV and thus
collisional excitation is not contributing at all. Once
ﬂuorescence and interactions between ionic species are
taken into account, excitation may change some approx-
imations (see discussion in Sec. 3.2.5 in Ferland et al.
2017). The interactions between species are partly in-
cluded in a simpliﬁed model by Koskela et al. (2012) for
elements up to oxygen. Ferland et al. (2017) discuss in
the implementation of the full collisional-radiative mode
(CRM) of the H- and He-like isoelectronic sequences,
that ionization out of highly excited states can alter the
ionization balance at some density regimes. Whether
this is an important issue in our targets remains an open
question.

For most nebulae, the dominant astrophysical evolu-
tionary timescale is that of their ionizing source. The
source (star) may heat up very rapidly, but, as men-
tioned, the ionizing timescale is anyhow very short
(Sch¨onberner 2008). Cooling or dimming of the ionizing
source, causing recombination, happens on timescales of
thousands to hundred thousands of years in most targets
of interest. An exception might be the planetary neb-
ulae (PNe) around massive progenitor stars However,
their nebulae are very dense and only in the very out-
skirts weak eﬀects can be determined (e.g. NGC 6445,
van Hoof et al. 2000).

Hence the recombination evolution is dominated by
the dimming/cooling timescale of the ionizing source.
There are only a handful of exceptional targets, suf-
fering fast cooling and/or dimming, where we in fact
are able to investigate isolated recombination in–situ
without major obfuscation caused by other processes.
Here we present the observational study of V4334 Sgr
spanning a period of more than 16 years. It suﬀered a

very late thermal pulse (VLTP) which caused a sud-
den loss of the ionizing UV radiation. This caused
the onset of recombination in the old PN surrounding
V4334 Sgr. Pollacco (2002) ﬁnds no discernible recom-
bination through the ﬁrst 3 years of evolution after the
event whilst Sch¨onberner (2008) argues that the total
timescale is dominated by the ionization timescale and
that a new recombined equilibrium is reached after only
a few months.

2. THE TARGET

In 1996 Nakano et al. (1996) discovered the re-
brightening of Sakurai’s Star (V4334 Sgr) as a cool post-
AGB star.
It was surmised to have undergone a very
late thermal pulse (VLTP) around 1991 or 1992 (Herwig
2001; Lawlor & MacDonald 2003; Hajduk et al. 2005;
Miller Bertolami et al. 2006). The star was found to
be at the center of an old planetary nebula. After the
eruption, the star expelled a new shell, located inside the
old, now recombining PN. Since then spectra have been
taken frequently. These provide the ﬁrst closely spaced
time series of spectra of an ionized nebula that under-
goes recombination without any reionization by UV pho-
tons emitted by the central star.

Evolutionary models predict re-heating of the star of
V4334 Sgr to temperatures that would result in renewed
photoionization of the nebula (Hajduk et al. 2005) but
they diﬀer on the expected timescale for this. How-
ever, no evidence for a hot stellar continuum or stellar
wind features have been found in the optical nor in-
frared spectra so far (Hinkle et al. 2020). No evidence
for increasing free-free radio emission from the newly
ejected matter has been found either (Hajduk et al., in
prep.). Moreover, our FORS long slit spectra show a
very red continuum of the central source V4334 Sgr in
the optical. During the ﬁrst years of the campaign, the
continuum of the central source was not detected. Later
it slowly appeared above the detection limit. Stacking
the spectra taken in 2017 lead us to an estimated (B-V)
of the continuum of about +3.m4. If the central source
had heated to something hotter than 10 000 K, the in-
trinsic colors -0.m3≤(B-V)0 ≤0.m0 (Ducati et al. 2001)
would require optical extinctions of AV > 11.m5. This
assumes that the observed continuum is generated by di-
rect light. Scattering at circumstellar clouds, eﬃcient in
the the blue bands, leads, like the scattered-light resid-
ual in R CrB stars, to an underestimate of the extinction
Clayton et al. (2011). The value ﬁts well to the extinc-
tion derived by the photometric evolution when the shell
was formed (Pavlenko & Duerbeck 2001). Similar results
for the extinction were found by Koller & Kimeswenger
(2001) for the older twin V605 Aql by comparing optical

3. DATA

The data sample used consists of a set of a few hundred
long slit spectra crossing the old PN nebula around the
centraL VLTP object V4334 Sgr. These were obtained
with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) unit telescopes
(UTs) 1 and 2 using the FORS1/2 spectrographs (Ap-
penzeller et al. 1998). The original purpose of the ob-
servations was to study the changes in the central star
V4334 Sgr itself. Since the slit was always aligned in the
same direction it is also possible to study the outer neb-
ula as an unintended but perfectly homogeneous byprod-
uct. The entire project was conducted in service mode
demanding good weather conditions (CLR). However,
during the data reduction, some spectra with lower qual-
ity showed up. The data originally covered 11 observa-
tional epochs from 2007 to 2017 with 265 spectra. A few
spectra were removed from this study, as the slit center-
ing was not perfect in one run in 2011 (Reichel 2021).
In 2022 (3rd to 10th of April) an additional set of 18
spectra were taken, improving the timeline which now
spans over 16 observing seasons. The service mode logs
always mention at least clear weather conditions and
good seeing. However, after the additional calibration
processing, we rejected 46 spectra due to poor seeing or
signiﬁcant zero point oﬀsets. Thus a total sample of 237
spectra remained.

The VLT observations used ﬁve diﬀerent low resolu-
tion GRISMs1 (Anderson et al. 2017; Reichel 2021). Ta-
ble 1 provides an overview of the covered wavelength
regime and the resolution near the central wavelength.
There is some overlap between the spectra from the red
and the blue setup which can be used as an additional
test of the calibration quality and homogeneity of the
data.

The data were taken between April and August of each
year, with an East-West orientated slit. Two images,
obtained from the ESO archive, were taken with FORS1
October 2nd 2002 using an [O III] narrow band ﬁlter.
After each frame a second frame was taken using a ﬁlter
for extragalactic observations redshifted by 6000 km s−1.
Those images were used to remove the stars. The slit
position is indicated in Fig. 1. A slit width of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 was
used until 2016. In 2017 and 2022 a 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 slit was used to
cover the new ejecta of the VLTP which were growing in
size. Further data was taken with FORS by other groups
covering the time just after the outburst. However, as

to infrared luminosity. This extreme extinction inhibits
potential UV photons from the reheating central star
from reaching the region of the old PN. Our ALMA ob-
servations (Van de Steene et al. 2017; van Hoof et al.
2018a) of HCN and HNC molecules in the newly ejected
material give us an estimate of the UV ﬂux in the core
of 0.5 erg cm−2 s−1, based on the recent investigation by
(Bublitz et al. 2021) in the clumps of the Helix nebula
(NGC 7293). The molecular gas detected by ALMA is
at most 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48) from the core (Hinkle et al. 2020). This
gives an upper limit for the total UV ﬂux in the com-
pact core ≤ 0.1 L(cid:12). Moreover, this radiation will have
a geometrical thinning of at least 1/500 before reaching
the outer location of the old PN. Re-ionization of the
old PN by UV photons from the post-VLTP star thus
can currently be neglected for this study.

Other potential targets which could be used to study
recombination have been discussed in the past. These
include the late thermal pulse (LTP) stars FG Sge
Tylenda (1980); Arkhipova et al. (2009) and Hen 3-
1357 (Stingray Nebula) (Reindl et al. 2017; Lawlor 2021;
Balick et al. 2021), the VLTP star V605 Aql (studied
in Lechner & Kimeswenger 2004; Koskela et al. 2012)
and the very young dense PN SwSt 1 Hajduk et al.
(2020). Also, the nebula around the family of post-
common-envelope pre-cataclysmic BE UMa variables
feature recombination eﬀects (Mitrofanova et al. 2016;
Kimeswenger et al. 2021, and references therein). How-
ever, all those targets do either not have such a rapid
evolution of the ionizing UV radiation, have much larger
densities and thus very fast recombination in equilib-
rium, or are lacking an appropriate time coverage with
homogeneous spectral data.

Thus our target provides a unique laboratory where
the UV radiation was suddenly and completely switched
oﬀ.

slit position and orientation varied and mostly were far
from our target position, they are not used here.

Observations were always conducted with the same
sequence centering an oﬀset star in direct images and
blind-oﬀsetting to the faint target. Three spectra with
exposure times around 900 seconds were taken. Such
a sequence forms one observing block (OB). If another
OB followed directly, the centering was redone to in-
sure against pointing drifts or ﬂexure. For each year
and each GRISM two to four of these OBs were taken.
The wavelength and basic ﬂux calibration was derived
by the ESO FORS pipeline2 (ver. 5.6.2; Moehler et al.
2019) with the night sky removal deactivated to avoid
partial removal of nebular lines. The further manual
steps were obtained in the framework of ESO MIDAS
(Warmels 1992; Banse et al. 1983; European Southern
Observatory 2013). These manual steps were a) remove
sky emission lines, b) correct for sky transparency vari-
ations, c) correct for seeing slitloss, and d) manual ex-
traction of the PN emission lines from the 2D spectra.
Small MIDAS batch ﬁles were written to speed up and
homogenize this interactive process. The four steps are
described in detail below.

As the ESO pipeline is dedicated to stellar spec-
troscopy, the automated search for night sky emission
lines also removes partially the lines of extended emis-
sion line objects like PNe. Thus this process was dis-
abled in the pipeline. Moreover, along the 7 arcmins
long slit some remnant of the optical curvature remains
after the pipeline reduction. Star-free regions along the
slit just outside the PN only about 20 arcsec from the
nebula were used to derive a night-sky emission line

of the PN in the 2D spectra.

The standard extinction curve derived by Patat et al.
(2011) is automatically applied by the ESO pipeline.
The typical airmass was between 1 and 1.1 (see Fig 2A).
Thus the corrections were small. However as we had
shown in observations of the scattered light at several
nights near full moon some oﬀsets of the transparency
can occur even in very good nights (Jones et al. 2013,
2019). The ESO standard stars, automatically used by
the pipeline, are taken not very frequently during nights
in the service mode calibration plan. Only a few of our
OBs were taken at higher airmasses > 1.35. Those where
rejected from the ﬁnal sample.

The ﬂux zero points then were checked by the ﬂux
of ﬁeld stars well centered in the slit. At the begin of

the y direction to enhance the visibility of the centering) before adding the GRISM. Only well centered stars were selected for
calibration purposes. The lower panel shows a fraction of the red end of the spectrum taken directly thereafter. The selected

an OB a slit preview image without the grism is taken
for centering purposes. This was used to identify stars
along the slit which are well centered. Solely those give
a good calibration factor for the slitloss correction de-
pending on the seeing only. Six stars (four on chip one
which also contains the optical center of the FOV and
thus the PN and two on the second chip) were identi-
ﬁed (Fig. 3). Six frames from one night in 2011 with
GRISM 300V were rejected as the sky region was taken
erroneously with a few arcseconds oﬀset. The ESO Am-
bient Conditions Data Base (ASM)3 shows for the best
photometric nights the zero points given in Patat et al.
(2011). Those 26 spectra are used as the basis for the
transparency 1.0. In fact, we measure later only relative
variations with time. Therefore, the chosen absolute ze-
ropoint is not of importance here. The median of the
ﬂux, integrated along the whole spectrum of the ﬁeld
stars, is used to deﬁne the oﬀset. The scatter among
them was of the order of 0.m05. Thus the diﬀerential
error of the calibration of individual spectra should be
in the order of 6−0.5 × 0.m05 = 0.m02. Figure 2D) shows
the distribution of the derived transparency values we
used for corrections. They correspond well to the values
of the ASM. We set a rejection limit at a transparency
loss of -0.m25.

The typical seeing was about 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48). However, seeing
values up to 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) sometimes occurred. A few spectra
had extreme seeing and thus blurred images. The see-
ing was measured from the FWHM of the stellar images
along the slit. The values corresponded well with those
given by the ASM. Assuming Gaussian point spread
functions, the slit-losses relative to the median FWHM

were derived. ESO takes the standards for the service
mode with very wide slits to be free of slit losses, but
the pipeline does not apply a correction for the user’s
science frames. The ﬂux calibration of a point source
with a partially ﬁlling PSF in a slit and that of a ho-
mogeneously slit-ﬁlling extended source diﬀers. For this
purpose, a small MIDAS batch was used to derive the
factor of the ﬁlling by the calibration stars for each frame
individually. The fraction of a 2D Gaussian with the de-
rived FWHM was used to obtain the conversion factor
(Fig. 4). Generally, this was small as well as the slits
were normally wider than the seeing. Figure 2 shows
the distribution of the seeing values and the resulting
slit eﬃciencies (≡ 1−slit-loss). A pair of direct con-
secutive nights with seeing 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)58 and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)13 were used to
estimate the errors of the correction procedure. They
are in the order of 0.m04. The worst images with slit eﬃ-
ciencies below 0.55, which also are those showing blurry
spectra, are rejected from the sample. At the PN lines,
we assumed, that the illuminations do not vary on the
scale of the slit size. As the proﬁles along the slit also do
not show very rapid ﬂux variations we are conﬁdent that
this assumption holds. The table containing all correc-
tion factors for the whole set of nearly 300 individual
spectra can be found in the appendix of Reichel (2021).

Finally the spectra of each PN line were extracted
from the 2D spectra manually by marking interactively
the line emission region. Several ﬁeld stars cross the re-
gion of the nebula (see Figs. 1 and 6) . Normally the
stellar ﬂux just beside the emission line is interpolated to
correct for that. However, especially around the Balmer
lines, the stellar ﬂux under the nebular emission lines
may behave diﬀerently than predicted by continuum in-
terpolation for the star, due to strong Balmer absorption

ing the same night. However, between sets taken weeks
to months apart, ﬂuxes do vary slightly. As we do not
expect physical processes in the PN on those timescales,
we assume these variations to originate from the weather
and calibration inaccuracies. These variations give us a
ﬁnal estimate for the errors. For some lines, more than
20 individual measurements are available within some
of years. All data points of one line for one GRISM
within a year were averaged, giving the data points di
and its standard deviations σi. In the case of indepen-
dent data points, the error of a mean value is smaller
than the standard deviation of the individual measure-
ments. Then, our error would be smaller by a factor of
2 to 4. But we are dominated by systematic and not by
statistical errors. Therefore, this approach might be too
optimistic. To use this standard deviation as error for di
is a very conservative access. The measurements in the
overlap region from the visual to the infrared GRISMs
are treated as independent data sets. The values used
in the statistical analysis are given for each data set and
each year in Tab. 2.

Sets taken at higher and lower resolution by the
300V/I and 600V/I GRISMs overlap in the region of
the Hα line. Figure 6 shows the region of overlap and
the various resolution eﬀects. In case of the low resolu-
tion GRISMs the [N II] 6548 ˚A line slightly blends with
H I 6563 ˚A. However, the nitrogen line originates from
the same upper excitation level as [N II] 6584 ˚A. Thus
the line ratio is ﬁxed to a value of 2.96 by the ratio of
the quantum mechanical transition strengths Aki mul-
tiplied by the ratio of the line wavelengths, taken from
the NIST atomic database Tachiev & Froese Fischer
(2001). This allows us to reconstruct the undisturbed
hydrogen ﬂux. The He I 6679 ˚A was too weak to be
used for a signiﬁcant decent fraction of the time series.
The [O I] 6300+6363 ˚A pair was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
the telluric line, and could not be fully recovered. The
partly resolved [S II] 6716+6732 ˚A pair was summed to
improve signal-to-noise ratio.

The data from diﬀerent instrumental conﬁgurations
of the same line show small variations between the dif-
ferent sets but do not show systematic trends. Diﬀerent
instrument setups also show no systematic eﬀects. Up to
20 measurements were available per year. Moreover, the
three line pairs H I 6563+4861 ˚A, [O III] 4958+5007 ˚A
and [S III] 9068+9530 ˚A are tightly coupled by quantum
mechanics and have well determined line ratios. Their
consistency provides an additional quality test for the
calibration.

lines in the stellar spectra. As we are interested in vari-
ations only and not in the total PN ﬂux, we masked
these regions. Finally, the central region of V4334 Sgr
was masked in order to exclude the recent ejecta (Hinkle
& Joyce 2014; Hinkle et al. 2020), where the emission
lines can be orders of magnitudes brighter than those
of the PN (van Hoof et al. 2007, 2018b). This avoids
possible scattered light in the instrument (see Figure 5)
arising from those lines of the VLTP core.

Within each set of three spectra of a single OB, the
ﬂux of the lines (integrated over the used area along the
slit) does not vary beyond the photon noise. The same
applies to the rare cases of OBs taken consecutively dur-

4. RESULTS

We analyzed the change as a function of time, by us-
ing annual groups of line intensities for each instrumen-
tal setup as independent data points di. The baseline
is taken as time t0 = 2012.45, which is the mean time
point of our original data, 16.31 years after the discov-
ery of the event (Nakano et al. 1996). The total process
follows an exponential decline (see Equ. 7). As the total
timescale τrec is so much longer than the epoch of our
investigation, a free parameter, giving the curvature of
the exponential, cannot be derived unambiguously and
numerically stable. Thus we use the Taylor series lin-
ear approximation here. We derive independent model
regression points mi of the type

mi = c (ti − t0) + n

with c being the average annual change. As mentioned
above the errors σi vary strongly for some lines (see also
Tab. 2). Thus the Equ. 2 does not resemble the χ2 deﬁ-
nition where σi ∝
mi anymore. Thus standard regres-
sion algorithms used widely do not apply (York 1966;
Giordano & Iavernaro 2021; Lecuna et al. 2020). The
regression analysis follows Tellinghuisen (2020). The de-
rived value of n normalizes each of the data sets with
respect to the line strengths at t(0). This is slightly dif-
ferent from using just a weighted mean for the time t0,
but is numerically more stable against the strong year-
on-year variations of the errors which are seen especially
for the helium lines. For the regression the mpfit library
(Markwardt 2009) was used, with the variable errors
handled according to York (1966) in the implementa-
tion by Tellinghuisen (2020). The errors given by the
mpfit library for the c parameter represent the statisti-
cal error with two parameters for the calculation of the

The fractional area of overlap A between the ’sloping’
and ’non-sloping’ distribution functions yields the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance (1 − A) of the slope as a single pa-
rameter. This signiﬁcance is lower than what would be
derived from the standard deviation of the inclination
(relative change per year) given by the ﬁt with two free
parameters. Figure 7 shows an example of such a pair
of histograms. A-priory this solution of the MC simu-
lation, caused by the wide spread of errors between the
individual data points, does not have to be distributed
Gaussian. Tests indeed showed that it deviates from
solutions with large slopes. As the result for our cases
only shows very small slopes, there is only a marginal
deviation from Gaussian. As the assumption of a regu-
lar standard deviation holds we are able to use the error
function erf from the integral of the Gaussian according
to equation 5 to derive the size of the intersect,

in the signiﬁcance of any slope, rather than the param-
eter c (respectively its normalized counterparts Ck from
equation 3) and its potential contribution to the sta-
tistical error budget. To derive the signiﬁcance of the
slope, a C program was written to perform a Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation. The value n from Equ. 2 deﬁnes the

Despite the fact, that some lines are coupled by phys-
ical and quantum mechanical processes, each line was
treated individually in this statistical process. This gives
additional conﬁdence about the stability of the anal-
ysis. The results are shown in Figure 8 and Table 3
lists the annual changes and the statistical uncertain-
ties compared to a constant solution derived from the
MC simulations. The hydrogen and the helium lines
show, as expected by most models, no variations with
time during our survey. Both [O III] lines show inde-
pendently the same weak decline in intensity by about
2 percent per year, while the low ionized species [N II]
and [S II] show a weak strengthening of about 3 percent
per year. The eﬀects are small compared to the errors
just at the boundary to be detected and thus support
the models predicting a slow evolution (see discussion
below). Moreover, the identical behavior of the indepen-
dently treated pairs of [O III] and of [S III] strengthens
the statement of the evolution found.

5. DISCUSSION
The Z 2 dependence of the recombination rate on the
charge of an ion (see Eqn. 1) causes the observed states
of O++, S++ and Ar++ to react fastest to the sudden
loss of the UV radiation ﬁeld. As the observed line lev-
els are collisionally excited, the line strength is related
to the total population of the species for constant elec-
tron temperature. E.g., the [O III] lines in our spectra
originate from the ﬁrst exited term above the ground
state and are mostly collisionally excited. The line in-
tensity of the 5007/4958 ˚A transitions thus is directly
proportional to the amount of O++.

The population of the particular ionization state de-
creases because of direct recombination losses and in-
creases because of recombination of the higher ionization
states (O3+, S3+ and Ar3+). CLOUDY photoionization
models of the pre-outburst PN by Pollacco (1999, 2002);
Juﬃnger (2021) show that O3+ was not populated sig-
niﬁcantly (≤ 3%), while S3+ and Ar3+ had a population
of about 8% each. Hence, recombination for the higher
levels can be ignored for these three species. However,
more detailed estimates follow below.

The fractional population of various ionization stages
are listed in Table 4. These are calculated from the
CLOUDY model Juﬃnger (2021), and averaged over an
area to account for the narrow slit used in the observa-
tions.

For the radiative recombination factor αRR(T, Z) we
used the data from (Badnell 2006), while for the di-
electric component αDR(T, Z) the calculation is based
on the C-like sequence of Zatsarinny et al. (2004) in
the updated web-based version of the group (Badnell
2019). The same data is used for the current version
of CLOUDY c17 (Ferland et al. 2017) as well. Follow-
ing Osterbrock & Ferland (2006) these two components
can be simply added together to obtain α(T, Z). The
modern values diﬀer slightly from the often used values
in the tables of Osterbrock & Ferland (2006), which are
based on somewhat older calculations (Verner & Ferland
1996; Mazzotta et al. 1998, and references therein). The
older values were used to estimate timescales by Pol-
lacco (1999); Lechner & Kimeswenger (2004), and lead
to a somewhat faster than expected evolution.

The recombination timescale τrec is then given by

τrec =

1
α(Z, Te) ne

(6)

with Z the ionic charge, Te the electron temperature and
ne the electron density. Diagnostic diagrams of observed
spectral line ratios yield Te (cid:39) 11 000 K and 140 ≤ ne ≤

180 cm−3 (Pollacco 1999; Kerber et al. 1999; Juﬃnger
2021). These values are typical for old PNe generally
¨Ottl et al. 2014; Barr´ıa et al. 2018). This
(see e.g.
density is much lower than the one used in the test for
dynamical evolution with CLOUDY by van Hoof et al.
(2020). We use the upper limit of ne ≈ 180 cm−3 for
our estimates. Lower values will result in an even slower
evolution.

The timescale for the recombination of the small (3%)
O3+ population becomes only 13 years. Accounting for
this and assuming all O3+ was added quickly to O++,
this ionization state covers more than 73% of the total
amount of oxygen in the CLOUDY models. The pre-
dicted timescale of the O++ recombination t ≈ 61 years
leading to about 25% of decline from the 1996 outburst
until the epoch at the end of our observations.

This prediction is within the bounds of the observa-
tional result in Tab. 3. Using an undisturbed and thus
exponential decline,

leads in our observations to a timescale of about 50
years. Within the uncertainties of the density estimates
and the statistical uncertainties this matches well. The
rate of decline is about an order of magnitude slower
than the values given in Pollacco (1999).

The population of S3+ and Ar3+ with timescales of 11
and 16 years respectively, would depopulate those states
by about 75% each. This adds about 7% to S++ and
Ar++. The latter states, originally populated by about
73 and 90% of the total sulfur and argon, have timescales
of 40 and 50 years to recombine to S+ and Ar+. Thus
even with the compensation by the faster recombining
of higher levels, we predict a decline of about 50%. The
observations do not conﬁrm a signiﬁcant decline. Both
states show an increase at the 1σ level. Due to the
higher errors, the Ar++ observations are consistent with
the predicted time scale only at the 2σ level (probability
(cid:47) 2%). For S++, the discrepancy is in excess of 4.5 σ
and thus highly signiﬁcant.

The observed increase of the lines of the low ioniza-
tion stages N+ and S+ reﬂect their populations of re-
spectively 27 and 18% pre-outburst. Their lifetimes are
250 years or more. Thus even a limited fraction of re-
combination from the upper ionization states will yield
a signiﬁcant strengthening of the [N II] and [S II] lines.
The recombination timescales calculated for hydro-
gen H+ and He+ are 450 years or more. This is sup-
ported well by the observations, which do not indicate

Recombination of hot ionized nebulae: V4334 Sgr

11

any changes in these emission lines. Moreover, as those
elements outnumber the other ions by two orders of mag-
nitude, the fraction of the total energy density bound in
ionization does not change at all.

The nebular expansion could also aﬀect ﬂux evolution
due to decreasing electron density. However, the mea-
sured expansion of 30±3 km s−1 (Juﬃnger 2021) leads
to an estimated decrease by a factor of 7 × 10−4 per year
and unit volume. This is much slower than the expected
eﬀect from recombination and below the accuracy of the
observations themselves.

6. SULFUR

A notable discrepancy with the predicted evolution is
seen for sulfur, where the [S III] lines are constant in
strength whereas the models predict a decrease. This
can come from an additional source of S2+ which bal-
ances the recombination.

Measured sulfur abundances in planetary nebulae are
anomalously low (Henry et al. 2012) compared to other
elements. The sulfur deﬁcit is up to a factor of 2. Pos-
sible causes are discussed in Henry et al. (2012). They
state that in some cases, telluric absorption near the
[S III] 9068+9530 ˚A may be present. In our case, the res-
olution is very good and the very long FORS slits allow
excellent sky reduction. However, the sulfur problem
is most pronounced for high ionization, matter-bounded
nebulae. This suggests that the models may be miss-
ing higher ionization stages, leading to underestimated
ionization correction factors. Direct measurements of
infrared [S IV] lines have provided support for this con-
clusion (Henry et al. 2012), as these ﬁnd a higher than
predicted abundance of this ionization stage for these
nebulae.

The old PN of Sakurai’s star falls in the category of
If the S3+
high excitation, matter-bounded nebulae.
abundance is higher than predicted in the model, the
fast recombination from this level would increase the
source function of S2+. Higher ionization stages, S4+
and higher, could contribute since they would recombine
very fast to S3+.

We recalculated the expected abundance change of
S2+ for variable abundances of S3+ and higher ioniza-
tion stages. The measured change with 1 − σ errors
can be reproduced if the higher ionization stages ac-
count for 65 ± 16% of sulfur, as opposed to 10% in the
CLOUDY model. This gives a total sulfur abundance
that is around 55% higher than in the model, which is
within the typical range of the sulfur anomaly.

A sulfuric dust component, which is another explana-
tion for the anomaly, would not aﬀect the recombination
rates. More accurate data will be needed for this anal-

ysis, but the apparent recombination discrepancy sug-
gests, that higher ionization stages may be involved in
part or all of the observed sulfur anomaly.

7. CONCLUSIONS

We were able for the ﬁrst time to follow the recombi-
nation evolution of a very low-density galactic gaseous
nebula. careful analysis determines the order of magni-
tude of the eﬀects of recombination. This result excludes
by orders of magnitudes some faster evolutionary scenar-
ios postulated before. While oxygen seems to follow the
predicted evolution for updated atomic data, other met-
als do not agree as well, and especially sulfur deviates
signiﬁcantly from the predictions.

For sulfur, the lack of fading of the [S IV] lines points
to possible recombination from unobserved higher ion-
ization levels. There is some evidence that the ’sulfur’
anomaly (a sulfur abundance deﬁcit) may be caused by
unexpectedly high levels of S4+. The current investiga-
tion has led to some support for this. Other explanations
have also been proposed and it is important to continue
these studies.

The high eﬃciency of energy transfer by ﬂuorescence
calculated by Deguchi (1985) suggests that this increases
the ionization levels of the metals. Electron transfer re-
actions from the long-lived ionized hydrogen and helium
may also add to this. As those long-living species out-
number the metals by orders of magnitudes, their exci-
tation energy and electron losses could aﬀect the met-
als without signiﬁcantly changing their own abundances.
The theoretical recombination rates may therefore be
subject to change.

In conclusion, these observational results can be use-
ful for validating more complex time-evolution models
(see e.g. van Hoof et al. 2020, and references therein)
which are in development. The simpliﬁed recombination
timescale calculated previously (Pollacco 1999; Lechner
& Kimeswenger 2004; Balick et al. 2021) may have to be
revisited, while the estimates of an even much faster evo-
lution by (Sch¨onberner 2008), assuming timescales well
below a year, are not conﬁrmed. Further monitoring of
V4334 Sgr will be needed to improve the signiﬁcance of
the result but the results are encouraging and unique.
