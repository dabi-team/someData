ribbon ﬂares (CRFs) in active region (AR) 12434. They were observed by SDO, GOES,

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
are the most spectacular and energetic activi-
ties in our solar system, which have poten-
tial impact on space weather (Schwenn 2006;

Chen 2011; Fletcher et al. 2011; Holman et al.
2011).
The free magnetic energy is accu-
mulated before ﬂares via various mechanisms
(Wiegelmann et al. 2014), such as ﬂux emer-
gence (Sun et al. 2012),
twisting (Li et al.
2017a; Xu et al. 2017), and/or shearing motions
in the photosphere (Su et al. 2007). The stored
energy is impulsively released via magnetic
reconnection (Priest & Forbes 2002; Su et al.

way, the energy in nonthermal electrons is con-
verted through Coulomb collisions into energy
in the thermal plasma.

A fraction of energetic electrons may es-
cape into the interplanetary space along the
open ﬁeld and generate type III radio bursts
(Mann et al. 1999; Benz 2008). The radiations
in hard X-ray (HXR), soft X-ray (SXR), ultra-
violet (UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), white
infrared, and radio wavelengths
light (WL),
increase dramatically and reach an apex dur-
ing the impulsive phase that spans a few to
tens of minutes (Benz 2008, see Fig. 2 for an
illustration). Afterwards, the ﬂuxes of radia-
tion decline with time and the post-ﬂare loops
cool down via heat conduction and radiative
loss (Cargill et al. 1995). Flares are classiﬁed
into conﬁned and eruptive types according to
their association with CMEs (Wang & Zhang
2007; Sun et al. 2015; Thalmann et al. 2015),
although the visibility of CMEs depends greatly
on ﬂare intensity (Yashiro et al. 2005).

Although a general framework of ﬂares has
been established, the energy partition is still
controversial in that the energy release, trans-
port, and conversion processes are very com-
plicated and strongly coupled.
In fact, the
situation varies from case to case. Hence,

statistical studies are more appropriate to ad-
dress this issue. After a detailed investigation
of 24 ﬂares observed by GOES and the Ra-
maty Hight Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002), Warmuth & Mann
(2016a) found that a relatively cooler plasma
component (10
25 MK) is produced by chro-
mospheric evaporation, while a hotter compo-
nent (
25 MK) is produced by direct heating
in the corona. Therefore, they concluded that
electron beam heating at the chromosphere is
insuﬃcient to account for the heating of the hot

Using coordinated observations from multiple
space-borne instruments, Emslie et al. (2004)
evaluated the energetics of two ﬂare/CME
events, including the energy contents of CMEs,
thermal plasma of the ﬂares, nonthermal elec-
trons, ions, and solar energetic particles. It is
concluded that, with large uncertainties, CMEs

free energy. After reﬁning the ﬂare energy es-

has not been explored.

In this paper, we study the energy partition in
two homologous M1.1 CRFs on October 15 and
16, respectively. In Section 2, we describe the
observations and data analysis. The morpho-
logical evolution of the ﬂares and accompanying
type III radio bursts are presented in Section 3.
The calculations of diﬀerent energy contents are
elucidated in Section 4. We compare our ﬁnd-
ings with previous works in Section 5 and give
a brief summary in Section 6.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

In the context of standard ﬂare model, the
ﬂare ribbons show diverse motions (Fletcher et al.
2011; Holman 2016).
In most cases, the rib-
bons separate as magnetic reconnection pro-
ceeds (Qiu et al. 2002; Ji et al. 2004). Apart
from separation, the brightening may propagate
along the ribbons (Qiu et al. 2017). For three-
dimensional magnetic reconnection within the
thin quasi-separatrix layers (Demoulin et al.
1996), ﬂare ribbons propagate along the in-
tersection of QSLs with the chromosphere
(Aulanier et al. 2007). Circular-ribbon ﬂares
(CRFs) are a special kind of ﬂares that con-
sist of a central short ribbon and a surrounding
ribbon with a circular or quasi-circular shape
(e.g., Masson et al. 2009; Reid et al. 2012;
Jiang et al. 2013; Joshi et al. 2015; Kumar et al.
2015; Yang et al. 2015; Hao et al. 2017; Hernandez-Perez et al.
2017; Song & Tian 2018; Chen et al. 2019;
Li & Yang 2019; Zhang et al. 2019). Most of
them are conﬁned ﬂares without CMEs. The
magnetic topology of CRFs is usually composed
of a null point, a spine, and a dome-like fan
surface (Zhang et al. 2012, 2015; Masson et al.
2017; Li et al. 2018). In 2015 October, a series
of homologous, short-lived CRFs occurred in
active region (AR) 12434. For the ﬁrst time,
Zhang et al. (2016a) studied explosive chromo-
spheric evaporation in a C4.2 CRF that oc-
curred on October 16. Besides, Zhang et al.
(2016b) reported periodic chromospheric con-
densation in a homologous C3.1 CRF in the

The M1.1 CRFs taking place in AR 12434
were observed by SDO, RHESSI, WIND,
and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH;
Nakajima et al. 1994). AIA takes full-disk im-
ages in two UV (1600 and 1700 ˚A) and seven
EUV (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335
˚A) wavelengths.
The photospheric line-of-
sight (LOS) magnetograms were provided by
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Scherrer et al. 2012) on board SDO. The AIA
and HMI level 1 data were calibrated using
the standard Solar Software (SSW) programs

respectively.

spectra by the combination of an isothermal
component determined by the isothermal tem-
perature and EM and a nonthermal compo-
nent created by the thick-target bremsstrahlung
of energetic electrons with a low-energy cutoﬀ
(Brown 1971; Warmuth & Mann 2016a). The
spectra ﬁtting is conducted using the OSPEX
software built in SSW.

As a ground-based radio telescope at the
Nobeyama Radio Observatory, NoRH observes
the Sun at frequencies of 17 and 34 GHz with
spatial resolutions of 10′′ and 5′′, respectively.
In addition, the type III radio bursts related to
the ﬂares were recorded in the radio dynamic
spectra by WIND/WAVES (Bougeret et al.
1995). WAVES consists of two detectors: RAD1
(0.02
13.825
1.04 MHz) and RAD2 (1.075
MHz). The observational parameters are sum-
marized in Table 1.

3. CIRCULAR-RIBBON FLARES AND

TYPE III RADIO BURSTS
In Figure 1, AIA 171 ˚A images of the ﬂares
(CRF1 and CRF2) are displayed in the left pan-
els (see also the online animation). Like the C-
class ﬂares reported in Zhang et al. (2016a,b),
CRF1 and CRF2 feature a short inner ribbon

and an elliptical outer ribbon. The length scale
40′′) of these compact ﬂares is comparable
(
∼
to that of coronal bright points (Zhang et al.
2012). The corresponding HMI LOS magne-
tograms are displayed in the right panels of Fig-
ure 1. The inner and outer ribbons correspond
to negative and positive polarities in the photo-
sphere, respectively.

Figure 2 shows twelve snapshots of the AIA
304 ˚A images (see also the online animation).
The two ﬂares have some kind of similarity in
morphological evolution. The inner ribbon and
northwest part of outer ribbon brightened ﬁrst,
which was followed by brightening of the south-
east part of outer ribbon (see panels (b) and
(h)). Afterwards, the brightness of ﬂare rib-
bons declined with time. Since the ribbon sep-
aration in conﬁned ﬂares is more or less static
(Hinterreiter et al. 2018), the areas of CRFs did
not change remarkably as expected.

In Figure 3, the SXR light curves of CRF1

˚A increases rapidly from
23:27 UT until the
23:31 UT, before a gradual de-
peak value at
23:50 UT. Therefore, the lifetime

of CRF1 is
23 minutes. The dashed line sig-
niﬁes the background ﬂux, which will be sub-
tracted to get a net SXR irradiance (see Fig-
ure 7(a)). Figure 3(b) shows the time evolu-
tions of the isothermal temperature (Te) and
EM of the SXR-emitting plasma, which will
be used to calculate the total radiated energy
from the SXR-emitting plasma. The tempera-
ture reaches a peak value of 14.7 MK at 23:30:15

at 23:32:54 UT. The dashed line represents the
background ﬂux, which will be subtracted to
get a net irradiance (see Figure 7(c)). The cor-
rected count rates at diﬀerent energy bands are

pared with AIA, the ﬂare is a single, bright
source. Time evolution of the integral ﬂux

UT, followed by a gradual decline until

UT. Therefore, the lifetime of CRF2 is

minutes. The maximal isothermal temperature
(16.8 MK) of CRF2 is slightly higher than that
of CRF1, while the maximal EM of CRF2 is
slightly lower than that of CRF1. In Figure 5,
the full-disk radio image in 17 GHz at 06:13:48
UT on October 16 is displayed in panel (c),
and a closeup of CRF2 is displayed in panel
(d). Time evolution of the integral radio ﬂux
of CRF2 is plotted in Figure 4(e). Likewise, the
time evolution of normalized integral intensity
of CRF2 in 1600 ˚A is shown in Figure 4(f). The
simultaneous peak time at 06:13:48 UT is indi-
cated by the red dashed line.

Like the C3.1 CRF reported by Zhang et al.
(2016b), both CRF1 and CRF2 were associated
with type III radio bursts, which are pointed
by the arrows in the radio dynamic spectra
recorded by WIND/WAVES (see Figure 6).
The starting times of radio bursts were consis-
tent with the peak times in 17 GHz, implying
a common origin of the radio emissions. The
ﬂare-accelerated nonthermal electrons stream-
ing down into the chromosphere create strong
emission in 17 GHz via gyro-synchrotron ra-
diation mechanism, while those escaping from
the corona along open ﬁeld lines create type III
bursts via plasma radiation mechanism.

light curves in 1

1.0 is the volumetric ﬁll-

2013). Assuming that V is an invariable, then
Eth reaches the peak value when Te√EM is
maximal (see Figure 3(b) and Figure 4(b)).

≈

To get a better estimation of V , we use
two independent methods. As pointed out by
O’Dwyer et al. (2010), the dominant contribu-
tion of ﬂare spectrum for AIA 131 ˚A channel
comes from the Fe xxi line with formation tem-
7.05. In the bottom panels
perature of log T
of Figure 7, light curves of the ﬂares in 131 ˚A
are plotted with cyan lines. It is evident that
the 131 ˚A irradiance is well correlated with
f1−8. Therefore, the hot plasma observed in
131 ˚A during a ﬂare is a good proxy of the
SXR-emitting plasma (Fletcher et al. 2013). In
Figure 9, the left panels demonstrate the 131 ˚A
images 10 minutes after the peak times (tpeak in
Table 2), since the images at the peak times are
severely saturated. The total areas (A131) of
the ﬂares can be obtained by setting a thresh-
old of intensity, which is
5 times larger than
the average intensity of a nearby quiet region.
Considering that the ﬂares were close to the
limb, the projection eﬀect is corrected by mul-
tiplying a factor of (cos µ)−1, where µ denotes
the longitude of ﬂare core. The corresponding
volume V131 is deﬁned as A3/2
131. The values of

∼

A131 and V131 are listed in the second and third
columns of Table 3. If the threshold intensity is
set to be
6 times larger than the quiet region
intensity, the areas in 131 ˚A drop by a factor of
8% and the volumes decrease by a factor
6%
−
of 10%

12%, accordingly.

∼

The second approach to calculating the ﬂare
area is based on the fact that the outer ribbons
of CRFs mapping the footprints of the post-ﬂare
loops in the chromosphere hardly expand with
time. In Figure 9, the right panels demonstrate
the 1600 ˚A images at their peak times when the
ribbons are the most noticeable (see Figure 3(f)
and Figure 4(f)). Since the outer ribbons are
not fully closed, we perform an ellipse ﬁtting
of the outer ribbons (magenta dashed lines).
Hence, the ﬂare areas in 1600 ˚A (A1600) are
represented by the areas of ellipses after cor-
recting the projection eﬀect. The correspond-
ing volume V1600 is deﬁned as A3/2
1600. The values
of A1600 and V1600 are listed in the fourth and
ﬁfth columns of Table 3. It is obvious that both
area and volume in 131 ˚A and 1600 ˚A are close
to each other, suggesting that the two methods
are reasonable. By adopting the mean values
of ¯V in the last column of Table 3 and peak
EM during the ﬂares, the mean electron num-
ber density (¯ne) of the hot plasma is estimated
1010 cm−3 for CRF1 and
1010
to be
cm−3 for CRF2. The peak thermal energies of
1030
CRF1 and CRF2 are calculated to be 1.81
1030 erg. They are listed in the

where A0 is a normalized parameter of the total
electron ﬂux (in unit of 1035 electrons s−1), Ec
signiﬁes the low-energy cutoﬀ, and δ denotes
the power-law index. In each panel, the ﬁtted
thermal component is drawn with a red line,
while the nonthermal component is drawn with
a blue line. Likewise, three characteristic spec-
tra and results of ﬁtting for CRF2 around 06:14
UT are displayed in Figure 11. As expected,
the isothermal temperature from RHESSI ob-
servation is systematically higher than that
from GOES observation, which is explained
by the fact that RHESSI is more sensitive to
high-temperature plasma (Warmuth & Mann
2016a,b). The temperature exceeds 25 MK only
at one moment (see Figure 11(a)),
implying
the existence of direct-heated super-hot plasma
(Caspi et al. 2014; Warmuth & Mann 2016a,b).
For each ﬂare, EM increases with time, which
is consistent with the occurrence of chromo-
spheric evaporation that quickly responds to
the injection of electrons (Fisher et al. 1985;
Graham & Cauzzi 2015). The values of δ in the
range 4
9 are close to those of M1.0 ﬂare on
2010 August 7 (Fletcher et al. 2013).

By comparing the spectra in Figure 10 and
Figure 11, it is revealed that the electrons are
accelerated to higher energies by CRF2 than
CRF1. Meanwhile, the spectra indices of CRF2
are a factor of
1.5 harder than those of CRF1,
indicating that CRF2 is more energetic than

CRF1. The low-energy cutoﬀs (15

mate the energy in ions according to previ-

ous statistical works. The mean ratio of en-
ergy in ions to that in electrons is reported to
be
1/3 (Emslie et al. 2012; Aschwanden et al.
2017). Hence, the nonthermal energy in ions for
1030
CRF1 and CRF2 are 1.1
erg, respectively. The total nonthermal en-
ergy including electrons and ions for CRF1 and

CRF2 are thus 4.3

with previous conclusion that the thermal and
nonthermal energies are of the same magni-
tude (Holman et al. 2003; Saint-Hilaire & Benz

So far, it is still controversial whether the en-
ergy content in ﬂare-accelerated electrons and
ions is suﬃcient to account for the bolometric
radiation (i.e., TSI). On one hand, Emslie et al.
(2012) concluded with caution that there is suf-
ﬁcient energy in the ﬂare-accelerated particles
to account for the total bolometric radiation,
though the mean ratio of energy in acceler-
ated particles to the bolometric radiated en-
ergy is
0.7 in their sample. On the other
hand, Warmuth & Mann (2016b) insisted that
the nonthermal energy input by energetic elec-
trons is insuﬃcient to account for the total heat-
ing requirement of the hot plasma or for the

this study, the estimated nonthermal energies of
CRFs are very close to the estimated bolomet-
ric radiation (see Section 4.2 and Figure 12).
Hence, our result is in favor of the conclusion
by Emslie et al. (2012), albeit in-depth investi-
gation is needed in the future.

In a comprehensive investigation of the global
energetics of
400 ﬂare/CME events observed
by SDO, Aschwanden et al. (2017) concluded
that nonthermal energy of ﬂare-accelerated par-
ticles, the energy of direct heating, and the en-

than 2/3 of the dissipated energy. Therefore,
the dissipated magnetic energies of CRF1 and
1030 erg
CRF2 can be estimated, being
1030 erg (see Figure 12). It should be
and
emphasized that the estimated dissipated free
energy is an upper limit, since the CRFs in our
work are conﬁned events without CMEs and a
larger part of dissipated energy are involved in
particle acceleration. The reason why we do
not perform a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld extrap-
olation is that AR 12434 was close to the limb,
so that the measurement of photospheric vector
magnetograms was less reliable.

ﬁned ﬂares without CMEs in most cases. A

In this work,

for the ﬁrst time we explore
the energy partition in two homologous CRFs.
There are several factors that may have eﬀect
on the estimation of diﬀerent energy contents.
On one hand, the isothermal temperatures of
ﬂares from GOES are adopted when calcu-
lating the peak thermal energies (Emslie et al.
2012; Feng et al. 2013). However, the post-ﬂare
in nature (Sun et al.
loops are multithermal
2014). The thermal energies based on DEM
analysis are found to be
14 times on av-
erage larger than those of isothermal plasma
(Aschwanden et al. 2015). Hence, the peak
thermal energies in our study might be under-

estimated. On the other hand, the volumes
of SXR-emitting plasma in Table 3 are almost
one order of magnitude larger than the values
of M-class ﬂares (Saint-Hilaire & Benz 2005).
The diﬀerence may originate from the diﬀerent
methods of volume calculation. As mentioned
above, the threshold intensities of ﬂares in 131
˚A also have eﬀect on the volume of thermal
plasma. In this respect, the estimations of ther-
mal energies might be overestimated. In brief,
the two factors (temperature and volume) play
complementary roles, indicating that the results
of thermal energies are in a reasonable range.

The nonthermal energy of electrons is quite

±

1.6

sensitive to the low-energy cutoﬀ (Aschwanden et al.
2016). Sui et al. (2005) analyzed an M1.2 ﬂare
on 2002 April 15 and determined the cutoﬀ en-
2 keV). The total nonthermal energy
ergy (24
1030 erg.
in electrons is calculated to be
For the two M1.1 ﬂares in our study, the cut-oﬀ
energies are less than 20 keV (see Figure 10
and Figure 11). In the fourth line of Table 2,
the ratios of energy components between CRF2
and CRF1 are listed. It is obvious that CFR2 is
somewhat more energetic than CRF1, and the
energy partition is similar for the homologous
ﬂares of the same class.

×

∼

Finally, it should be emphasized that our cal-
culation of energy partition of CRFs have limi-
tations. The magnetic free energy, nonthermal
energy of ﬂare-accelerated ions, and TSI are es-
timated based on previous results for the lack
of suitable data (see Figure 12). Besides, the
conductive loss is not considered, although it
might be negligible compared to radiative loss
(Emslie et al. 2012). The energies of CMEs and
solar energetic particles accelerated by a CME-
driven shock are not considered because of the
conﬁned nature of ﬂares.

In the next step,

investigation of the en-
ergetics of CRFs with an EUV late phase
(Woods et al. 2011; Dai et al. 2013) is worth-
while, since part of the thermal energy is con-

−

tained in the hot spine loops during the late
phase as long as 1
2 hr after the main impulsive
phase (Sun et al. 2013). Furthermore, we will
work out the energetics of eruptive CRFs asso-
ciated with jets (Wang & Liu 2012; Zhang & Ni
2019) or CMEs (Joshi et al. 2015). The kinetic,
potential, and thermal energies distributed in
the ﬂare-related jets or CMEs will be evaluated
as precise as possible.

6. SUMMARY

energy, nonthermal energy of ﬂare-accelerated
electrons, total radiative loss of hot plasma, and
