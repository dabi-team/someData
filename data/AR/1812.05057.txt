Abstract: 

We  have  calculated  photoionization  cross-section  of  endohedral  atoms  A@CN.  We  took 
into  account  the  polarizability  of  the  fullerene  electron  shell  CN  that  modifies  the  incoming 
photon beam and  the one-electron  wave  functions of  the  caged atom  A.  We employ  simplified 
versions of both static and dynamic polarization. 

The properly modified one-electron wave functions became a starting point of the account 
of the multi-electron correlations in the frame of the random phase approximation with exchange 
(RPAE).  We  treat  atomic  and  fullerenes  polarization  that  act  upon  photoelectron  similarly, 
substituting them by static polarization potential. The photon beam polarizes the fullerene. This 
effect is accounted for introducing a polarization factor. 

As concrete objects, we have considered Ar and Xe atoms inside fullerene C60. Inclusion of 
polarization  prominently  increases  the  photoionization  cross-section  mainly  close  to  the 
threshold. 

Key words: endohedral, polarization potential, photoionization. 

1.  We  demonstrate  in  this  Letter  that  the  effect  of  polarizability  of  the  fullerenes  CN 
electron  shell  strongly  affects  the  caged  atom  A  photoionization  cross-section  not  only  via  the 
modification  of  the  incoming  photon  beam  that  acts  upon  atom  A  located  inside  CN.  The 
modification  of  the  photon  beam  was  qualitatively  understood  and  quantitatively  described 
relatively long ago (see [1] and references therein).  It is expressed via big (compared to atomic 
values) dynamic dipole polarizability 

d   of CN, where  is the photon energy. 

(

)

However,  the  static  polarizability  of  the  fullerene  CN  is  also  big,  and  is  able  to  strongly 
modify  the  electron  wave  functions  of  the  atom  A  inside  CN  and  CN  itself,  thus  leading  to 
prominent new features in photoionization cross-section of A@CN. Clarification of this effect is 
the principal aim of this Letter. 

The investigation performed here became possible as a result of recent prominent success 
in studies of the electron scattering  upon CN and  A@CN [2, 3]. These papers present relatively 
simple methods that permitted to evaluate the role of CN polarizability upon the cross-section of 
elastic  scattering  of  an  electron  by  A@CN.  The  idea  is  to  take  into  account  the  polarization 
potential of both CN and A, and to clarify their influence upon photoionization cross-section. At 
this moment we are unable to make one, but quite a big step further and to take into account the 
role of interaction between electrons that belong to A and CN.

2. We  intend to  calculate photoionization  cross-sections  of A@CN at first  in  the  frame of 
one-electron  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  approximation,  and  then  add  interelectron  correlations  in  the 
frame of  the  random  phase  approximation  with exchange  (RPAE).  The  necessary  details  about 
HF and RPAE equation and their solutions one can find in [4]. Here we present only important 
definitions and the main points of calculation procedures. 

The endohedral A@CN we treat as an atom A located inside of a polarizable shell CN, the 
direct  electronic  structure  of  which  we  neglect.  We  represent  CN  by  a  static  potential  with 
minimal  number  of  adjustable  parameters.  Very  often  it  is  considered  as  a  square  well,  with 
thickness  , depth,
[4], with R being the CN radius (see, 
e.g. [5]).

Such a potential leads, however, to unrealistic shape of the charge distribution [6].-This is 
why  in  this  Letter  we  choose  another,  so-called  Lorentz-shape  fullerene  potential  that  is 
suggested in [6]:

Here d is the potential width. 

Along with ( )U r , electrons of atom A are under the action of CN polarization potentialW . 
In general, this potential is non-local, dependent upon scattering energy E, and complex, i.e. has 
along with a real, also an imaginary part. To derive such a potential from first principles is very 
difficult, if possible at all. However, it is much easier to use instead a semi-empirical polarization 
potential WC. 

A  simplified  approach  that  is  often  employed  in  studies  of  electron-atom  collisions  (see, 

e.g. [4]), suggests the following simplified version of

But  WC  cannot  increase  in  the  empty  space  inside  a  fullerene.  In  photoionization  of  an 
endohedral, the region inside the fullerene is important since the following inequalities  ar

are valid, where  ar  is the radius of the atom A. For sufficiently big fullerenes, such as C60, with 
N=60,  and  bigger,  and  for  most  of  the  atoms  in  their  ground  states,  stronger  inequalities 
ar

This  expression  should  not  be  corrected  at  small  distances  (compare  (2)  and  (3)),  since 
there the atomic HF potential is much bigger than the polarization one, contrary to the fullerene 
case. 

In electron-atom scattering process much more accurate than employment of Eq. (4) is the 
approach,  based  on  the  many-body  perturbation  theory  [4].  However,  this  approach  was  never 
(except literally in a couple of papers, [7, 8]) used in studies of atomic photoionization, although 
it  permits  to  take  into  account  on  equal  ground  not  only  the  polarization  action  of  atomic 
electrons upon the outgoing one, but also the modification of the photon-electron interaction by 
accounting  excitations  of  core  electrons.  The  explanation  of  rare  use  of  this  approach  is  in  its 
complexity even for atoms. To do the same for endohedrals is much more complicated. This is 
why we decided in studies of photoionization of endohedrals to treat the polarization of fullerene 
CN and atom A on equal ground, using Ed. (3) and (4). 

As  a  result  of  presented  approximations,  the  HF  equation  for  multi-electron  atoms  looks

We see that the account of C60 action 
increases the cross-sections of A@C60 profoundly, as compared to its pure Ar values. Fullerene 
adds also a prominent oscillation in the cross-section of the endohedral. Note that the inclusion of 
attractive potentials (1), (3) and (4) shifts the photoionization thresholds to higher energies. 

Fig.  3  presents  the  Xe  and  Xe@C60  photoionization  cross-sections  for  the  photon  energy 
region from 3p6 threshold to well above the threshold of 4d10. The notations are the same as in 
Fig. 2. The presence of C60 manifests itself by a tremendous increase of the cross-section near the 
3p6 threshold and up to 2 Ry above it.

For  4d10  we  see  additional  oscillations 
that  were  predicted  some  time  ago  [10]  and 
qualitatively  confirmed  in  recent  experiments 
[11]. The role of GC factor at  above 4Ry is
