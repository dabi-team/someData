The ﬁrst prototypes of quantum computers sparked interest in quantum computing and the basic princi-
ples of quantum mechanics. The education project on the physical bases of quantum computing is part of
this context, based on the experimental description with virtual methods of the physical implementation
of Di Vincenzo’s ﬁrst 5 principles. The computation process is implemented as transformations of qubits
encoded in the polarization of optical photons. These transformations are implemented as quantum gates
made as 3D virtual objects using Blender. In detail, the models of: Laser Ar +, PBS, HWP / QWP, BBO,
APD, SMF, Control electronics are made. With the 3D models, a virtual laboratory has been created within
CoSpaces where it is possible to become familiar with the basic processes of quantum computing: produc-
tion of announced photons, transformation of a qubit, measurement of a qubit, production of entangled
photons, transformation of two qubits, measure of two qubits. The realization of physical models to be
used in the metaverse could ﬁll the didactic void due to the absence of quantum optics laboratories.

1. INTRODUCTION

Quantum computing is enjoying great success in different envi-
ronments, from school to professional and business, thanks in
particular to the promise of creating systems that are currently
unworkable through traditional information technology, such
as secure [2] cryptography. The enthusiasm for this discipline,
which in fact is also generating signiﬁcant market hype, seems
to be more linked to marketing phenomena than to its real sci-
entiﬁc content and its real applications. To have a real positive
impact, innovation needs widespread diffusion and a growing
level of adoption to express its full [3] potential. In the case of
quantum computing, this assumption today collides with two
main obstacles. The ﬁrst is related to the accessibility to the
tools (hardware) that would allow the practical learning of the
technology. The second is the complexity of the subject itself,
which often discourages the non-specialist public. This work
aims to overcome these obstacles in order to democratize access
to the understanding and use of quantum computing, in partic-
ular by attracting young minds, in order to increase its adoption
and prevent the repetition of what is already happened for tra-
ditional information technology, of which the mass public still
ignores the basic principles, despite the spread of technological
products, while also the specialist public often misinterpreted
both the limits and the actual possibilities. Our studio changes
the didactic approach, using CoSpaces as an engagement and
learning tool. By introducing quantum computing as one of
the different declinations of experimental computation [5], [1],

instead of as a reality in its own right, the learning path is re-
versed starting from the experiment and going back to the the-
ory. In practice, instead of presenting quantum computing start-
ing from the quantum theory of computation, we introduce it
through some quantum physical systems, made in 3d in a vir-
tual environment, sufﬁcient to implement Di Vincenzo’s ﬁrst 5
criteria. Systems whose dynamic evolution produces and pro-
cesses qubits.

We believe that this approach not only simpliﬁes learning,
but is highly attractive to students thanks to the use of the Meta-
verse and a gaming component. For example, in the context
of secondary education, where computer science can be intro-
duced in a natural way as the result of the dynamic evolution
of a physical system, our project can become a tool that en-
gages young minds and encourages study and interest in the
subject. The objective of this study was to identify, analyze and
formalize quantum physical systems to create a coherent and
uniform presentation on two distinct levels: one is the practical
one, created through 3D models of physical systems arranged
in a virtual laboratory of a platform. of Metaverse, the other is
the descriptive and formal one that uses the natural language
of physics. The ﬁrst ﬂoor is mainly aimed at students and en-
thusiasts who ﬁnd there a concretization of ideas and concepts
that are often disclosed in approximate terms and that can con-
fuse ideas rather than clarify them. The second is aimed at
teachers, disseminators and trainers, who through the formal
description can spend themselves in clear and constructive dis-
sertations based on theoretical foundations.

A. DiVincenzo’s criteria

The purpose of a quantum computer is to physically implement
the states of the qubits and the unitary transformations that
operate on them where the term "physically" means that there
must really exist, not only in mathematical formulas, an instru-
ment that has qubits and of devices to modify them. Quantum
computing is therefore based on the design and construction of
a real physical system composed of qubits registers and instru-
mentation acting on them.
As can be expected this is a very complex conceptual and tech-
nological challenge. To address this challenge by transforming
it into the solution of a problem with an analytical method, the
physicist DiVicenzo proposed a list of requirements for build-
ing a physical system capable of quantum processing, that is, a
quantum computer. The criteria are divided into two groups,
the ﬁrst concern the computation:

• A system of well characterized and scalable qubits in size

• The ability to initialize (set) the state of the qubits

• Long decoherence times (loss of coherence)

• A universal quantum gates system

• The ability to measure each qubit

The second relate to communication

• Possibility of transforming calculation qubits into informa-

tion exchange qubits

• Ability to reliably transmit qubits

In this paper, in accordance with the stated objectives, we will
identify a set of physical systems that implement DiVincezo’s
ﬁrst ﬁve principles.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

The technological solutions implemented so far for the realiza-
tion of qubits range from optics to the physics of matter. For the
purposes of this work, we have chosen to implement qubits as
the polarization state of a single photon and therefore to imple-
ment the physical production and processing systems as optical
systems. Five different systems have been described in detail,
listed below:

1. Production of an announced photon (heralded)

2

• Prisma ottico

• Quarter wave plate (QWP)

• Half wave plate (HWP)

• Avalange photo diode (APD)

• Single photon counter

• Borate crystal of Barium: BaB2O4 (BBO)

• Single mode ﬁber (SMF)

Each of the elements listed above was built as a 3D model us-
ing Blender software (https://www.blender.org/). The individual
elements were then arranged in different setups to create the
5 physical systems shown in the list above. For each of the
ﬁve physical systems described, a formal description was cre-
ated that describes the main physical phenomena involved, a
3D scene with the experimental setup and a space on CoSpaces
(https://edu.cospaces.io/Universe): a platform for teaching and
developing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).
The CoSapces environment allows you to develop interactive
3D projects using 3D objects and application code. Projects can
result in non-interactive 3D videos or in interactive applications
such as simulations or video games.

3. RESULTS

A. Heralded photon production

A.1. Physical principles

An Argon ion laser is used to produce a photon beam with
wavelength λ = 351 nm. The laser beam then passes through
a PBS to obtain a vertically polarized transmitted beam and a
horizontally polarized reﬂected beam at the output. The polar-
ization angle of the laser beam is further corrected by a HWP,
this to allow greater accuracy than what can be obtained by
directly rotating the PBS. The laser then reaches a BBO crys-
tal which has ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices of
1.6776 and 1.5534 respectively. The birefringence of the BBO al-
lows the absorption of one photon of the laser (k1, ω1) and the
relative emission of two photons (k2, ω2) and (k3, ω3) by means
of a Spontaneus Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) type I.
The polarization state of the two emitted photons must be the
same and complementary to the state of the absorbed photon,
this for conservation of energy and moment, in fact we have
that the conservation of the moment:

5. Realization of a transformation of the state of two photons

(C-Not)

Each of the proposed systems has been extrapolated from the
description of an experimental setup published in peer re-
viewed journals and has been adapted by replacing the in-
strumentation actually used with an idealized instrumentation.
Overall the tools used for all the experiments are:

• Laser Ar+

• Polarizing beam splitter (PBS)

The equation 2 can only be satisﬁed if the two emitted photons
have the same polarization, as seen in ﬁgure 1. The two
photons emitted following the SPDC therefore have the same
polarization and are emitted at a known angle. One of the
two photons is then led to a detector (APD) while the other is
led to other stages of transformation that will be seen below.
The detection of the ﬁrst photon (herald photon) therefore
announces the presence of a photon of known polarization that
can be used for further processing.
This system realizes the ﬁrst
two criteria of DiVincenzo
establishing in fact the use of the polarization of the photon
as a qubit and the possibility of initializing the state of the qubit.

A.2. Implementation in Blender

The complete diagram of the physical system is shown in ﬁgure
2. The experimental setup was basically taken from [6].

Fig. 1. The ﬁgure shows the graph of the ordinary and ex-
traordinary refractive indices (no and ne). The existence of two
different refractive indices allows the conservation of the mo-
ment in the SPDC TYPE-I process.

correctly represented.
The simulation at the point above was used to develop an in-
teractive path in which the user must correctly conﬁgure the
experiment to observe the production of heralded (announced)
photons and their correct detection. In detail, the user must ﬁrst
activate the laser beam, then adjust the two PBS to the correct
angle.
The objects were physically arranged according to the scheme
in ﬁgure 2. Together with the objects of the physical experi-
ment, a ﬂoor and walls were arranged so that the experiment
is placed in a physical environment in which the various com-
ponents are arranged in separate rooms, to create a scenic effect
and a playful setting. Articles of interest have been hung on
the walls and can be viewed and clicked to access the original
documents. Using the partition walls, the names of the physical
devices and the explanation of the role in the experiment were
entered.
The space on CoSpaces of this experiment has been named "Her-
alded photon production" and is publicly reachable from the
address https://edu.cospaces.io/ZQA-LGN.

Fig. 2. The ﬁgure shows the realization of the experimental
setup in Blender.

A.3. Virtual reality application

The objects developed with Blender were exported in GL Trans-
mission Format Binary ﬁle (.glb) and imported on CoSpaces.
The objects were imported one by one separately so that it was
possible to separately manage the events generated by the in-
teraction with the user (mouse click, etc.). A laser beam and
two photons were also modeled, the ﬁrst as a cylinder and the
second as two spheres. The laser beam leaves the Ar+ laser gen-
erator (see ﬁgure 3) and separates into two components at the
ﬁrst PBS (see ﬁgure 4). The two spheres represented the pho-
tons are generated at the BBO and then reach the one APD and
the other SMF.
Using the objects described above, a simulation of the produc-
tion process of the announced photons was implemented. The
simulation is descriptive in fact the angle between the two out-
going photons and their production rate are not respected, but
on the whole the main processes involved in the experiment are

polarization beams perpendicular to each other.

it and positioning the HWP at 0°, then clicking on the BBO to
view the emission of the two photons due to SPDC TYPE I.

larization state (qubit) on a spherical surface plus a point, this
representation is called Bloch sphere ( see ﬁgure 6). All possible
transformations of a qubit can be seen as rotations of the unit
vector representing the point on the Bloch sphere. Since an arbi-
trary rotation in R3 can be decomposed into three independent
rotations around two non-parallel axes, it is possible to realize
any rotation of the polarization by three successive rotations
around two axes. To carry out this transformation, waveplats
were therefore used that perform rotations around two axes of
the Bloch sphere. If you choose the x axis and the y axis as axes,
then you can use a QWP for the rotations around the y axis and
a HWP for the rotations around the x axis of the sphere by Bloch.
In the system proposed here, two QWPs and one HWP are used
to produce an arbitrary transformation of the polarization state
of a photon. The three devices are aligned on a single axis ac-
cording to the QHQ scheme, i.e. a QWP, a HWP and a QWP.
Rotating them respectively by α, β and γ we obtain the unitary
transformation U which corresponds to a rotation around the n
axis in the Bloch sphere of the photon polarization:

Un = Rp(α)Rq(β)Rp(γ)

which corresponds to a transformation of the state of the qubit.
where n denotes the axis of rotation, R is the rotation matrix,
and p and q are two non-parallel directions.

DiVincenzo’s criteria, providing the ability to perform any uni-

To their right an object
has been arranged that represents a source of a single initial-
ized photon, in practice it summarizes what we saw in the
previous experiment in a single object that integrates all the
necessary components. The source is aligned with the optical
axis of the three wave plates in this way the photons emitted
by it can pass through all three. For this purpose, the code
that simulates the emission of a horizontally polarized photon
in response to the click on the object has been implemented.
The angle of each of the three wave plates can be changed as
desired in a 5° step. To the left of the plates there is an object
that represents the direction of the qubit (polarization of the
photon) in the Bloch sphere. As the photon passes through
each plate, the qubit rotates in the Bloch sphere showing the
action of the three plates which then create a quantum gate.
The system is represented in ﬁgure 8.

deduced through a set of projective measures. For a two-level
system such as the (photonic) qubit, which is in a pure state,
V
the state of each photon can be written as:

source that produces only one photon at a time in the

polarization state. On the same optical axis there are three
waveplates with the QHQ scheme that allow you to change
the state of the qubit at will. Clicking on the photon source a
photon is emitted. The system then calculates the polarization
state of the photon on the basis of the ﬁve wave plates present
on its trajectory and shows on the Bloch sphere the state of the
qubit in correspondence with the plate crossed. At the end of
the optical path there is a PBS. When the photon reaches the
PBS the system calculates the probability that the photon will
be detected at the horizontal or vertical gate. The system also
takes into account the number of photons detected along both
gates. The system is shown in the ﬁgure 10.

E. Realization of a transformation of the state of two photons

(C-Not)

E.1. Physical principles

To satisfy DiVincenzo’s fourth criterion it is necessary to imple-
ment at least one quantum gate acting on two qubits. C-Not is
the standard gate in most quantum computer implementations
based on quantm gates. The C-Not foresees that the exit state
of the two qubits entering the gate depends on their entry
state which means an interaction between the two qubits
or an interaction between the qubits and the environment.
The physical implementation of C-Not with photonic qubits
poses the problem of non-interaction between photons and the
difﬁculty of obtaining non-linear effects using single photon
states. The C-Not can however be implemented with linear
optical transformations (KLM) [7] where the non-linearity term
is instead introduced by a measurement operation. A very
efﬁcient way to implement C-Not with linear optics consists
in exploiting two auxiliary (ancillary) photons produced in
the entangled state. This type of C-Not is said to be heralded
or heralded because the correct transformation of the target
qubit is probabilistic but is announced by the detection of
ancillary photons. A complete implementation of this circuit
is shown in [14], [10]. The system consists of two PBS (PBS 1
and PBS 2), one in the H / V base and the other in the D/A
+
). The two qubits
base (i.e. given by the states
+ β
controller (c) and target (t) in input cin = α
and
tin = γ
each enter a PBS through one port, while one
of two ancillary photons that are in an entangled state enters
the other. Two projective measurement systems are arranged
in correspondence to two of the four total output ports of the
system: the ﬁrst of a PBS in the D/A base and a pair of APDs
and the second identical but in the H/V base.

An explanation, even a superﬁcial one, of the experiment is
necessary for the didactic purposes pursued by this work. We
then divide the experiment into two parts. In the ﬁrst we con-
sider the two ancillary photons deﬁned by a factorizable (non-
entangled) state. In this scenario, each of the two beam splitters
(PBS 1 and PBS 2) works as a parity detector, i.e. the status trans-
mitted along the output port (cout for PBS 1 and tout for PBS 2)

is enabled only if the relevant detector receives 1AO1 (one and
only one) photons. In this case (1AO1), if we consider the two
PBSs separately, it is easy to show [10] that the exit state of each
PBS corresponds to the entry state, so cout = cin and tout = tin.
Obviously, in the process, trace of the incoming photons is lost
as they interfere with the two ancillary photons, what is really
transferred is the state of polarization (the qubit) and not the
photon itself which instead loses its distinction. 1 Proceeding
in the second part we consider the complete experiment and
therefore of two ancillary photons produced in an entangled
state, for example the state

In total there are therefore 4 photons. Since a true indistin-
guishability of the spheres used to represent photons is not pos-
sible, it was decided to proceed with a semi-classical representa-
tion of the experiment in which the photons are distinguishable
and distinguished by the color of the relative sphere that repre-
sents them. In this way the state of the polarization of the trans-
, so in general the input state does

not coincide, which can be a superposition of the base states.
The behavior of C-Not is however respected if we consider not
to use the output status for a subsequent computation but to
perform a projective measurement of the qubits cout and tout in
output.
To start the simulation, click on the source labeled "Target" and
activate the system that simultaneously emits the four photons
cin, tin, a1
out, as speciﬁed, each of a different color.
Their state is calculated in a deterministic way with regard to
unit transformations (wave plates and beam splitter) and with
a pseudo-random function for projective measurements on the
detectors. When the condition of 1AO1 is fulﬁlled, that is when
exactly one count is recorded on the pair D1/D2 and one on the
pair D3/D4 then the system announces the proper functioning
of the door, allowing the use of the two qubits cout and tout. The
system is shown in the ﬁgure 14.

The system was built on CospaCes similar to previous systems
(https://edu.cospaces.io/STC-NGC). There are two single pho-
ton generators representing the control qubit cin and the target
qubit tin. On the ﬂight line of both are arranged three wave-
plates in QHQ conﬁguration that allow you to transform, by
clicking on the wave plates, the two qubis at will before crossing
the relative PBS. The two PBS based D / A are made by placing

that giving shape and size to elementary particles is always a
gamble, but it is even more so in the case of the photon since it
has no mass and propagates at the speed of light. Beyond that
we do not forget Dirac’s statement that he writes that the main
objective of physics is not to provide a picture of nature, but
provide the laws that they govern the known phenomena that
can lead to the discovery of new phenomena.
Note that Dirac writes exactly:

of particles has not been transferred to the VR application. For this reason it is
important to have clear the difference between what is shown in VR and what is
correct in terms of quantum theory.

had had until the early 1920s. On the other hand, our goal is
on the one hand to show a 3D representation of quantum com-
puting experiments that can be inserted into the Metaverso plat-
form to improve the teaching of this topic, on the other hand it
is to provide a pictorial representation of what it also happens
behind the scenes to those without skills in quantum mechanics.
For this reason we think it is acceptable to depart from Dirac’s
no picture principle in well-deﬁned cases. In any case, we believe
that the discussion must remain open and that the topic is far
from being considered concluded.
A second controversial aspect concerns the semi-classic method
with which we simulated the C-Not door. This aspect is par-
ticularly interesting on the didactic level because it leads the
discussion to one of the ﬁrst works in reference to the quntis-
tic computation by the physicist R. Feynman [4], i.e. the doubt
whether it is possible to simulate or emulate a quantum process
on a classic computer. The delicate but interesting topic is dealt
with in [13] soon published on arxiv.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The goal of identifying, analyzing and formalizing ﬁve linear
optics experiments sufﬁcient to introduce the basics of quan-
tum computing has been achieved. The experiments were ex-
plained and analyzed on a formal level, but above all they were
implemented in terms of objects in VR. The result of the effort
made in this direction is evident if we compare the content of
the original articles with what we modeled. For example in
ﬁgure 15 the original diagram of the C-Not is shown as pre-
sented in[14]. For those who have experience in an optics lab-

computing. Furthermore, the development of animations with
which the user / student can interact allows to actively observe
the dynamic development of systems over time and not only
to imagine it based on the system equations. The last funda-
mental aspect of this work is to have developed these systems
so that they can soon be inserted into a Metaverse platform as
CospaCes itself is about to be or like other platforms already on
the market. The placement of these experiments in the Meta-
verse will allow to interact in multy-player modality with the
experiments themselves. In practice, students and researchers
/ teachers will be able to interact simultaneously on the same
experiment allowing both didactic and discussion activities.

oratory, this scheme is obviously evocative of the underlying
physical system and therefore is sufﬁciently explanatory of the
contents it must convey. The same scheme, however, is her-
metic for a non-expert reader and therefore of little didactic util-
ity if not further interpreted. Our contribution was precisely
in transforming schemes like this into 3D models represented
in VR that are in direct relationship with physical objects that
concretely carry out the physical transformations of quantum
