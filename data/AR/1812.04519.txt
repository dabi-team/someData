Abstract TREX-DM is conceived to look for low-mass
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) using
a gas Time Projection Chamber equipped with Mi-
cromegas readout planes at the Canfranc Underground
Laboratory. The detector can hold in the active volume
∼20 l of pressurized gas up to 10 bar, corresponding to
0.30 kg of Ar or 0.16 kg of Ne. The Micromegas are read
with a self-triggered acquisition, being thresholds be-
low 0.4 keV (electron equivalent) at reach. A low back-
ground level in the lowest energy region is another es-
sential requirement. To assess the expected background,
all the relevant sources have been considered, including
the measured ﬂuxes of gamma radiation, muons and
neutrons at the Canfranc Laboratory, together with the
activity of most of the components used in the detec-
tor and ancillary systems, obtained in a complete as-
say program. The background contributions have been
simulated by means of a dedicated application based
on Geant4 and a custom-made code for the detector
response. The background model developed for the de-
tector presently installed in Canfranc points to levels
from 1 to 10 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1 in the region of
interest, making TREX-DM competitive in the search
for low-mass WIMPs. A roadmap to further decrease it
down to 0.1 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1 is underway.

1 Introduction

Diﬀerent detector technologies have been developed in
the last decades with the aim to directly detect dark
matter particles which could be pervading the galactic
halo [1]. Looking speciﬁcally for low mass Weakly In-
teracting Massive Particles (WIMPs) requires the use

of light elements as target, detectors with very low en-
1, and very low ra-
ergy threshold, well below 1 keVee
dioactive background. Results from either new imple-
mentations of semiconductor detectors with extremely
low readout capacitance [2,3, 4] or re-oriented experi-
ments focused on low threshold [5, 6, 7,8, 9, 10] have al-
ready been presented. Gas Time Projection Chambers
(TPCs) equipped with Micromegas planes have excel-
lent features to fulﬁll these requirements. TREX-DM
(TPC for Rare Event eXperiments-Dark Matter) [11,
12] is a Micromegas-read High Pressure TPC for low
mass WIMP searches using Ar or Ne mixtures, not fo-
cused on directionality. The detector was built and op-
erated at surface in the University of Zaragoza as proof
of concept. The experiment was approved by the Can-
franc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain and the
whole detector was moved underground in 2018. The
data taking is expected to start using Ne once the com-
missioning underground along 2019 is completely ﬁn-
ished.

The Micromegas are consolidated readout structures;
a micro-mesh is suspended over a pixelated anode plane,
forming a thin gap where charge ampliﬁcation takes
place. Detectable signals in the anode and the mesh
are generated. Diﬀerent technologies have been built:
bulk Micromegas have the readout plane and the mesh
all in one and microbulk Micromegas are in addition
more homogeneous and radiopure [13]. They oﬀer im-
portant advantages for rare event detection [12,14]: the
possibility of scaling-up, topological information to dis-
criminate backgrounds from the expected signal (just
a few microns track for dark matter particles, giving a
point-like event) and low intrinsic radioactivity as they

are made out of kapton and copper, potentially very
clean.

Operating deep underground at ultra-low background

conditions is a must in experiments looking for rare
events like the direct detection of WIMPs. In this kind
of experiments, the construction of reliable background
models, based on an accurate assay of background sources
and on a careful computation of their contribution to
the experiment, is essential; they provide guidance and
constraints for design and allow robust estimations of
the experiment sensitivity (some recent examples can
be found at [15,16, 17,18,19,20,21,22,23]). The prelim-
inary background model of TREX-DM for operation
at LSC presented in [11,24] has now been completed
and updated, including as inputs the activities from
a dedicated material screening program together with
the measured ﬂuxes of diﬀerent backgrounds at LSC
(gamma-rays, neutrons and muons).

The structure of the article is the following. The
detector set-up and its performance are presented in
section 2. Section 3 describes the simulations carried
out. Then, the results obtained in the material radioas-
say campaign are detailed in section 4. The estimates of
the contribution of each one of the background compo-
nents considered are shown in section 5. Finally, the cor-
responding sensitivity for WIMP direct detection and
conclusions are discussed in sections 6 and 7.

2 Experimental set-up

The TREX-DM detector, as built and operated at the
University of Zaragoza, was described in detail in [11];
in the set-up at LSC some modiﬁcations have been im-
plemented: operation is made with non-ﬂammable gas
mixtures, microbulk (instead of bulk) Micromegas are
being used read by a new AGET-based DAQ system
and a full detector shielding is in place.

Two active volumes (19×25×25 cm3 each) are sepa-
rated by a central cathode made of mylar inside a 6-cm-
thick copper vessel, designed and certiﬁed as a pressure
equipment to hold up to 11 bar(a) or 10 barg (see ﬁg-
ure 1, middle). The ﬁeld cage, made of kapton and cop-
per using 42 Finechem resistors, is covered by teﬂon.
Two microbulk Micromegas fabricated at CERN are
used; they are the largest area single microbulk readout
produced so far, with an active area of 25×25 cm2 (see
ﬁgure 1, top). Flat cables take out signals from strips
and connect to the interface cards out of the vessel.
The connections at both sides of the ﬂat cables are now
made through special silicone-based connectors (Zebra
Gold 8000C from Fujipoly), checked to be more radiop-
ure than the connectors ﬁrstly used (see section 4). Sig-
nals from 2×256 strips (with ∼1 mm pitch) at each side

are digitized for tracking in a 10.2 µs window (512 sam-
ples, 50 MHz sampling rate). 3D track reconstruction
is possible, using the position of hit strips to deter-
mine X and Y coordinates, and electron drift time in-
formation to get the Z coordinate. The AGET-based
DAQ system consists of four front-end (FEC-AGET)
cards, containing 4 AGET chips each for sampling of
the pulses, four mezzanine (FEMINOS) cards, subtract-
ing pedestals, and a trigger module (TCM), connected
by Ethernet cables. It provides self-triggered data ac-
quisition allowing to have a trigger generated individu-
ally by each single strip signal; as capacitance of strips
is about a factor 30 lower than that of the mesh, the use
of AGET electronics was considered in order to improve
the energy threshold in comparison to the ﬁrst opera-
tion using AFTER electronics with trigger taken from
the mesh signal [11]. Two Faraday cages, one at each
end, have been installed housing the interface cards,
FEC-AGET and FEMINOS cards (see ﬁgure 1, bot-
tom).

As shown in ﬁgure 2, a complete shielding consist-
ing of 5 cm of copper, 20 cm of low activity lead and
40 cm of neutron moderator (water tanks and polyethy-
lene blocks) covers the detector at LSC, having in addi-
tion a Rn-free atmosphere inside shielding. The present
TREX-DM set-up installed at the hall A of the Can-
franc laboratory, placed at a depth of 2450 m.w.e., is
shown in ﬁgure 1, bottom, including the lead shielding.
The gas system of TREX-DM has been designed for
non-ﬂammable gases, which is accomplished adding 1%
of isobutane to argon and 2% in the case of neon. This
simpliﬁed installation underground. It consists of a re-
circulation part and a puriﬁcation branch and it can run
in two operation modes: in open loop (for commission-
ing tasks) or in recirculation through a puriﬁer branch
(nominal working condition). The gas system installa-
tion has been completed and certiﬁed by an authorized
body to operate at high pressure (up to 11 bar). The
slow control system, based on a net of Raspberry PI
cards, each of them monitoring or controlling one ex-
perimental component (like gas pressure and tempera-
ture, voltages or gas ﬂow), is ready and in operation.

First results from the commissioning phase of TREX-
DM on surface using bulk Micromegas were shown in
[11] for diﬀerent gas mixtures and pressures. Microb-
ulk Micromegas were characterized afterwards using the
mixtures ﬁnally considered for the underground oper-
ation, Ar+1%iC4H10 and Ne+2%iC4H10, in order to
check that the required performance was achieved also
in these conditions [25]. These tests were made at 1-
10 bar using a 109Cd source in a smaller set-up at
the University of Zaragoza (also used in [26]) with-
out shielding. Figure 3 presents the energy spectra reg-

istered at 10 bar; energy resolution has shown some
degradation with pressure, being the FWHM at 10 bar
16(15)% for Ar(Ne) at 22.1 keV. It must be noted that
neither the background level nor the energy thresh-
old in these measurements were representative of those
achievable at TREX-DM in LSC. As shown in ﬁgure 4,
an excellent behavior has been registered for gain, with
maximum values above 103(104) in Ar(Ne) for all pres-
sures, which is very important for achieving low energy
thresholds. In principle, a very low threshold is pos-
sible thanks to the intrinsic ampliﬁcation in gas but
the readout area, the sensor capacitance and the elec-
tronic noise set in practice the eﬀective threshold in
this type of detectors. For TREX-DM, the strip capaci-
tance, including the contributions of the ﬂat cables and
the interface cards, is ∼0.2 nF. The TREX-DM nomi-
nal (conservative) aim for eﬀective threshold is 100 eVee
(400 eVee). The very ﬁrst results from the commission-
ing data taken in Canfranc also using microbulk Mi-

cromegas with atmospheric Ar and with Ne conﬁrm
that this expectation is at reach.

At the end of 2018, the detector was already fully
equipped (as described in this section) and installed in-
side its copper and lead castle at LSC. For the ﬁrst
commissioning data, the chamber was ﬁlled with atmo-
spheric Ar+1%iC4H10 and operated at 1-1.5 bar. Cali-
bration measurements made with a 109Cd source indi-
cated that the detector operates as expected in terms
of gain and spectral and spatial distribution of events.
Few-days long background runs with the expected per-
formance were carried out, being the measured spectra
dominated by 39Ar. In the beginning of 2019, the gas
changed from the test option to the baseline mixture
Ne+2%iC4H10 in recirculation and operation at higher
pressures is underway. Data analysis is ongoing to pro-
duce quantitative statements on e.g. threshold level and
background level. A detailed description of the perfor-
mance of the detector will be presented in a dedicated
technical publication.

Gaussian ﬁt for estimating the FWHM at 22.1 keV are shown.
The ﬁtted peak is generated by the Kα (22.1 keV) and Kβ
(24.9 keV) X-ray lines produced by the source, as well as
their corresponding escape peaks. The copper K-ﬂuorescence
induced by the source at the copper components close to the
gas volume is clearly identiﬁed at 8 keV.

3 Simulation

The complete simulation of the detector response to
build the TREX-DM background model is based on
RestG4, a package integrating Geant4 [27] and a custom-
made code called REST [28], also used in [29]. Geant4
version 4.10 has been considered. The Geant4 Radioac-
tive Decay Module is used for the event generation.
The low energy models based on Livermore data li-
braries have been implemented for interactions of al-
pha, beta and gamma particles. These models are ac-
curate for energies between 250 eV and 100 GeV and
can be applied down to 100 eV with a reduced accu-
racy [30]. The NeutronHP model has been used for neu-
trons. A detailed geometry of the set-up has been im-

plemented based on the Geometry Description Markup
Language (GDML) format (see ﬁgure 5), including the
whole shielding (with copper, lead and neutron moder-
ator) and details of the copper vessel, ﬁeld cage, cath-
ode, cables and connectors and Micromegas readouts.
The ROOT-based code simulates also the electron gen-
eration in gas, diﬀusion eﬀects, charge ampliﬁcation at
Micromegas and signal generation. The resulting data
from the simulation chain have the same REST format
as the DAQ data in order to share analysis tools, in-
cluding those for discriminating point-like events from
complex topologies.

Simulations to build the TREX-DM background model

have been run for the two gas mixtures (Ar+1%iC4H10
and Ne+2%iC4H10) at 10 bar, corresponding to a total
active mass of 0.30 kg for Ar and 0.16 kg for Ne. A suc-
cessful validation of the simulation environment against
experimental data from calibration measurements has
been made [11]; in particular, the shape of the energy
spectra and the distribution of the analysis observables

4 Measurements of material radiopurity

An exhaustive material radioassay campaign for TREX-
DM was undertaken a few years ago [11, 14,31], as made
in other experiments in the context of rare event searches
(see for instance recent results in [32, 33,34,35, 36,37,
38]). It has allowed, on one side, to design and con-
struct the detector and shielding according to the ra-
diopurity speciﬁcations and, on the other, to provide
inputs to build the experiment background model. The
material screening program is mainly based on germa-
nium gamma-ray spectrometry carried out deep under-
ground in Canfranc, but complemented by other tech-
niques like GDMS and ICPMS and by measurements
using the BiPo-3 detector at LSC. In this section, the
techniques employed for the radiopurity measurements
are summarized and the relevant results shown and dis-
cussed.

4.1 Techniques

Most of the germanium measurements have been made
using a ∼1 kg ultra-low background detector of the
University of Zaragoza (named Paquito) operated at
the hall E of the LSC. This detector has been used for
radiopurity measurements at Canfranc for many years
(details on the features and performance of the detector
can be found in [31,39]). Some of the ∼2 kg close-end
coaxial HPGe detectors of the Radiopurity Service of
LSC [40] have been used for some measurements too.
Activities of diﬀerent sub-series in the natural chains
of 238U, 232Th and 235U as well as of common pri-
mordial, cosmogenic or anthropogenic radionuclides like
40K, 60Co and 137Cs are typically evaluated. The de-
tection eﬃciency is determined by Monte Carlo simula-
tions based on Geant4 for each sample, validated with a
152Eu reference source [31]; a conservative overall uncer-
tainty on the deduced eﬃciency is properly propagated
to the ﬁnal results.

Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS) has
been performed by Evans Analytical Group in France,
providing concentrations of U, Th and K. In addition,
thanks to the collaboration of LSC, Inductively Cou-
pled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis car-
ried out at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso
(LNGS) [41] has been possible for some TREX-DM
samples quantifying the U and Th concentrations. It
must be noted that when having no information on
daughter radionuclides in the chains, a possible dise-
quilibrium cannot be detected.

Taking advantage of the “foil” geometry of some
samples, very sensitive measurements have been made
in the BiPo-3 detector [42], in operation at LSC. This

measured were checked to be properly reproduced by
simulation when irradiating the active volume with a
109Cd source. The event-by-event signal identiﬁcation
and background rejection applied is based on the analy-
sis of the event topology. Firstly, just one-cluster events
are selected. This selection criterion hardly reduces the
rate a 0.1% since in the region of interest almost all
the events are single-site. The second condition is to be
farther than 2 cm from the lateral faces of the prism
deﬁned by the active volume; i.e., a planar ﬁducial cut.
Simulations show an accumulation of events near the
border of the readout plane due to photons produced in
interactions in surrounding materials (ﬁeld cage, cath-
ode frame, . . . ), which disappears after imposing this
2-cm-veto-area. Reduction factors in this case depend
very much on the background sources, but have mean
values of ∼40%. As our detector lies on one of its sides,
this veto also eliminates muons traversing directly the
detector. The active mass of the detector to obtain the
counting rates per mass unit is that of the ﬁducial vol-
ume. So far, the analysis has been quite simple and
more complex discrimination algorithms, based on the
analysis of current calibration runs, could help to fur-
ther decrease background levels.

detector has been developed by the SuperNEMO col-
laboration and is able to measure extremely low levels,
down to a few µBq/kg, of 208Tl and 214Bi radioactivity
in very thin samples (below 200 µm thick) by register-
ing the delayed coincidence between electrons and alpha
particles occurring in the BiPo events. These measure-
ments can be translated into contamination of natural
U and Th chains if secular equilibrium is assumed.

4.2 Results

A large amount of materials and components related to
Micromegas readout planes and the whole set-up (the
gas vessel, the ﬁeld cage, the radiation shielding or the
electronic acquisition system) has been taken into con-
sideration in the screening program. Massive elements
and those in contact with the sensitive volume of the
detector are in principle the most relevant. Table 1 re-
produces, for the sake of completeness, the previous ac-
tivity results obtained for the components ﬁnally used
in the TREX-DM set-up and presents all the new ones;
reported errors include both statistical and eﬃciency
uncertainties.

4.2.1 Shielding and vessel

Many samples from diﬀerent suppliers of lead, used for
shielding, and copper, used for mechanical and elec-
tric components (like Micromegas plates, cathodes, HV
feedthroughs or ﬁeld cage rings), have been analyzed
[11]. Results are available for the lead bricks used in
the shielding, provided by Mifer (#1 of table 1) and by
LSC (from lead coming from the OPERA experiment
[43]). Very stringent upper limits were also obtained by
GDMS for Oxygen Free Electronic (OFE, C10100) cop-
per from the Luvata company and the used Electrolytic
Tough Pitch (ETP, C11000) copper from Sanmetal was
measured too (#2-3 of table 1).

A sample of the copper provided by Sanmetal and
used at the vessel of TREX-DM, having the same ori-
gin and history of exposure to cosmic rays on surface
as the vessel itself, has been additionally screened us-
ing one of the germanium detectors of the LSC Ra-
diopurity Service with the aim to evaluate the cosmo-
genic activation induced in the vessel and then to as-
sess its suitability for a low background measurement
at LSC. The measured 60Co activity (#4 of table 1) is
in very good agreement with expectations for produc-
tion rates of ∼50 kg−1d−1 =0.58 mBq/kg (correspond-
ing to the order of diﬀerent direct measurements and
calculations from the literature [44]) and an exposure
time of τ /2 =3.80 y. The activity of other isotopes with
half-lives shorter than 60Co has also been evaluated:

(0.35±0.07) mBq/kg of 58Co, <0.81 mBq/kg of 57Co
and <0.29 mBq/kg of 54Mn. Thanks to the low energy
threshold of the GeOroel detector, it was possible in
this measurement to observe the 46.5 keV gamma line
from 210Pb and to derive an upper limit on its activ-
ity (considering the eﬃciency for surface emissions) as
<0.32 mBq/cm2.

Two samples of tube intended to be used at the
calibration system of TREX-DM, traversing shielding
and vessel have been screened (#5-6 of table 1). One
was made of PFA (PerFluoroAlkoxy polymer) produced
by Emtecnik and the other was made of PTFE supplied
by Tecnyﬂuor. Upper limits have been set for all the
common radioisotopes for both tubes and therefore any
of them can be used.

4.2.2 Field cage

Material and components to be used inside the gas ves-
sel, mainly related to the ﬁeld cage, were screened to
select proper teﬂon, resistors or adhesives.

The monolayer Printed Circuit Board (PCB) made
of kapton and copper for the ﬁeld cage, supplied by Lab-
Circuits, was found to have good radiopurity [11], but
since the upper limits set on the activity were too high
for the required sensitivity, a new sample with larger
surface was measured afterwards (#7 of table 1), pro-
viding a reduction of at least a factor 10 in the relevant
isotopes.

For the epoxy resin Hysol RE2039 from Henkel no
contaminant could be quantiﬁed [11,31] (#8 of table 1)
and it is being used for gluing.

Surface Mount Device (SMD) resistors supplied by
Finechem showed lower activity than other equivalent
units [11,31] (#9 of table 1) and therefore were chosen
for the ﬁeld cage.

A sample of the 3.5-µm-thick mylar sheet from Good-
fellow used at the cathode of TREX-DM has been screened
(#10 of table 1), setting upper limits for all the com-
mon radiosotopes.

The possibility of using 3D printing to produce eas-
ily some of the mechanical components of the ﬁeld cage
of TREX-DM, instead of fabricating them using com-
mercial teﬂon, was considered and the possible impact
on background evaluated. A sample made of PA22002
produced by a 3D printer at the Centro Nacional de Mi-
croelectronica (CNM), Barcelona, was ﬁrst screened us-
ing a germanium detector (#11 of table 1) setting upper
limits for all the usual radiosotopes. In an attempt to
reduce the available limits on activity for several plastic
samples, which would give a non-negligible contribution

2PolyAmide white or polyamide 12 or nylon 12.

to the TREX-DM background model, an ICPMS anal-
ysis was carried out at LNGS for three samples. For all
of them the mineralization was performed using the dry
ashing technique and the uncertainty of the measure-
ment can be estimated as 30% of the given values. For
teﬂon from Sanmetal, the ICPMS limits set for the ac-
tivity of 232Th and 238U chains (#13 of table 1) improve
by about two orders of magnitude those obtained using
the Paquito detector at LSC ([11,31]). Another type of
teﬂon, extruded PTFE (Gore GR gasketing), was also
analyzed, pointing to a similar radiopurity (#14 of ta-
ble 1). For a small piece of the nylon PA2200 from 3D
printing, previously screened at a germanium detector
setting upper limits for all common radioisotopes, both
U and Th concentrations could be quantiﬁed. As shown
in #12 of table 1, the corresponding 232Th activity is
compatible with the upper limits set using germanium
detectors, but being of the same order. For 238U, the
activity value from ICPMS is compatible with that for
the upper part of the chain from germanium (the ac-
tual comparable result between both techniques) but
higher that than for the lower part. Therefore, follow-
ing these radiopurity results and given the important
contribution expected from a nylon PA2200 ﬁeld cage
in the background model, its use has been disregarded
and teﬂon has been employed instead.

4.2.3 Electronics

Electronic connectors made of Liquid Crystal Polymer
(LCP) have shown unacceptable activities of at least
several mBq/pc for isotopes in 232Th and the lower part
of 238U chains and for 40K [11,31,35,36]. Three diﬀerent
types of silicone-based connectors supplied by Fujipoly
have been screened: Gold 8000 connectors type C, units
from Zebra Series 5002 SZ100 made of silver, and con-
nectors from Zebra Series 2004 CZ418 made of carbon
(#15-17 of table 1); although activities of 40K, 232Th
and the lower part of the 238U chain have been quanti-
ﬁed in all cases, much lower values than in LCP connec-
tors have been obtained. For silver connectors, activity
from 208mAg (T1/2=428 y, (0.38±0.05) mBq/pc) and
210mAg (T1/2=249.78 d, (1.88±0.12) mBq/pc) has been
assessed too. Due to these results, Gold Zebra 8000C
connectors were selected for TREX-DM; a new screen-
ing of the units to be actually used has been made
(#18 of table 1) conﬁrming that in comparison with
the Samtec LCP connectors ﬁrstly used in the set-up
at the University of Zaragoza [31], the silicone ones of
the present set-up have about a factor 32 less activ-
ity of 232Th and reduction is about 3.3 for 226Ra and
2.3 for 40K. Recently, very promising results have been
found in the screening of new connectors produced by

7

Samtec (Ref. ZA8H-24-0.33-Z-07) (#19 of table 1), as
only upper limits have been set for all the common ra-
dioisotopes, being more than one order of magnitude
lower than the quantiﬁed activities in the Fujipoly ones.
Comparing to the ﬁrstly used Samtec connectors, the
reduction is around two orders of magnitude. This has
been possible due to the very reduced mass of each unit
(0.087 g/unit) and the use of only kapton and copper
as base materials. This is an important result to take
into consideration in future upgrades of the detector.

Very radiopure, ﬂexible, ﬂat cables made of kapton
and copper have been developed in collaboration with
Somacis, performing a careful selection of the materials
included and avoiding glass ﬁber-reinforced materials at
base plates. After the screening of several cable designs
[11], the good results obtained for the ﬁnal one (#20
of table 1) allow to envisage the use of these materials
also at Micromegas production. Several kinds of high
voltage or signal cables have been analyzed too [11].
Screened cables from Druﬂon Electronics (to connect
the ﬁeld cage last ring to HV feedthrough) and coax-
ial low noise cable from Axon Cable S.A.S. (to extract
the mesh signal from the vessel) are being used. Only
40K activity was quantiﬁed for the two cables (#21-22
of table 1), made basically of copper and teﬂon, show-
ing much better radiopurity than typical RG58 coaxial
cables.

Diﬀerent materials can be taken into consideration
for PCBs and samples of FR4, ceramic-ﬁlled PTFE
composite and cuﬂon were screened [11]. The ﬁrst ones
presented very high activities for the natural chains and
40K, precluding its use. Good radiopurity was found for
cuﬂon from Crane Polyﬂon; however, its application for
Micromegas has been disregarded due to the diﬃculty
to ﬁx the mesh and also because bonding ﬁlms to pre-
pare multilayer PCBs have been shown to have unac-
ceptable activity [36]. Following the measurements #7
and #20 of table 1, kapton-copper boards seem to be
the best option.

One of the electronic boards used at TREX-DM
(with approximate surface 14×25 cm2) has been di-
rectly screened (#23 of table 1). Values of speciﬁc ac-
tivity obtained for 232Th and 238U chains are a factor
2-3 larger than those measured in a raw PCB made
mainly of FR4 from Somacis company [11], which seems
to point out to an additional relevant source of activity
in the electronic components of the board. A sample
of non-functional AGET chips (2.74 g/pc) provided by
CEA Saclay has been screened too. Following the re-
sults in #24 of table 1, each chip has a few tenths of
mBq of 40K and of the isotopes of the 232Th and 238U
chains. These non-negligible quantiﬁed activities in the
electronic components should not pose a problem since

8

they are located outside the copper and lead shielding
of the DAQ system. As part of the common eﬀort to de-
velop radiopure electronic components in collaboration
with CEA Saclay, a sample of four units of AGET chips
with a diﬀerent ceramic cover provided by CEA was
analyzed too (#25 of table 1). Speciﬁc activities of the
order of tens of Bq/kg have been measured for the iso-
topes of the 232Th and 238U chains; the corresponding
activities per unit are from two to three orders of magni-
tude higher in comparison to those previously obtained
for AGET chips with plastic cover. Therefore, the use
of this type of ceramic packaging must be avoided. A
large sample of naked chips has been screened too at
the Modane Laboratory conﬁrming a very good radiop-
urity.

4.2.4 Micromegas

The radiopurity of Micromegas readout planes was ﬁrst
analyzed in depth in [39]. On the one hand, two samples
(#26-27 of table 1) were part of fully functional Mi-
cromegas detectors: a full microbulk readout plane for-
merly used in the CAST experiment and a classical Mi-
cromegas structure without mesh. On the other hand,
two other samples (#29-30 of table 1) were screened
corresponding just to the raw foils used in the fabrica-
tion of microbulk readouts, consisting of kapton metal-
ized with copper on one or both sides. The raw materi-
als (kapton and copper, mainly) were conﬁrmed to be
very radiopure; the numbers for the treated foils show
similar limits or values just at the limit of the sensi-
tivity of the germanium measurement. Despite their
importance, these bounds were still relatively modest
when expressed in volumetric terms, due to the small
mass of the samples. New activity measurements for
the microbulk Micromegas and Cu-kapton-Cu foil sam-
ples (previously measured with Ge spectroscopy) were
carried out proﬁting the great capabilities of the BiPo-
3 detector operating at LSC (#28,31 of table 1). For
both cases, only limits to the contamination in 208Tl
and 214Bi can be deduced, which improve the Ge spec-
trometry limits by more than 2 orders of magnitude,
pointing to contaminations at the level of, or below,
∼0.1 µBq/cm2 [14]. A more sensitive measurement for
microbulk Micromegas produced at CERN was made in
2016, using two capsules of the BiPo-3 detector (30×30 cm2
each); results shown in #33 of table 1 point to a very
signiﬁcant reduction of the upper limits of both 208Tl
and 214Bi. All this conﬁrms our expectations that mi-
crobulk readouts contain radioactivity levels well below
typical components in very low background detectors.
As the BiPo-3 detector can only quantify activity
from the U and Th chains, but a non-negligible K con-

tent seemed to be present in the ﬁrst analysis of mi-
crobulk Micromegas [39], a new, more sensitive analysis
of the 40K activity was undertaken since its contribu-
tion in the background model was found to be impor-
tant [11]. A sample of the same microbulk Micromegas
analyzed in the BiPo-3 detector was screened using a
germanium detector (#32 of table 1) deriving upper
limits for all the common radioisotopes. Limits set for
238U and 232Th chains are higher than those derived
from BiPo-3 measurement as expected. The limit for
40K is <2.3 µBq/cm2, a factor 25 lower than the esti-
mated value in [39]; even if very promising, it was not
conclusive yet as the analyzed sample had not the holes
produced by the potassium compound which could be
responsible of a 40K contamination. Then, a new, more
massive sample of readouts from CERN with a total
surface of 12372.75 cm2 was analyzed. It consisted of
faulty GEMs glued on kapton, produced as microb-
ulk Micromegas, which have gone through some chemi-
cal baths involving potassium compounds to create the
kapton holes. This sample has been screened up to three
times:

– In the ﬁrst screening in a germanium detector, as
shown in #34 of table 1, upper limits have been
set for all the common radioisotopes except for 40K;
those of 232Th and 238U activity are, as expected,
higher than the ones obtained from the BiPo-3 de-
tector (about a factor of 5.7 and 2, respectively).
The signal from 40K is clear and its activity has been
quantiﬁed as (3.45±0.40) µBq/cm2 (corresponding
to a speciﬁc activity of (258±30) mBq/kg). This
seemed to conﬁrm that the potassium content is re-
lated to the production of holes in the readout.
– In an attempt to reduce potassium, the same sam-
ple with holes was cleaned in water baths at CERN
(dipped one week in tap water followed by a long
rinse with deionized (DI) water) and a new screening
to assess the eﬀect of this treatment using the same
detector was made. As presented in #35 of table 1,
the measured 40K activity is (0.84±0.16) µBq/cm2,
reduced by a factor 4, but an important uranium
activity is unexpectedly obtained. The ratio of ac-
tivities of the mothers of the 238U and 235U chains
is 20.6, in very good agreement with the expec-
tation for natural uranium. The origin of the rel-
evant uranium contamination found, at the level
of (564±62) mBq/kg of 238 or (45.8±5.0) ppb of
U, is unknown. A possibility is that it is related
to the tap water used for baths3. Presence of 7Be
(T1/2=53.22 days, decaying by Electron Capture to

3Levels of uranium in drinking water are of the order of
10 µg/l or 10 ppb, being possible a large dispersion around
this value.

9

ground or excited states) has been identiﬁed too
thanks to the 477.6 keV gamma emission; due to
its half-life, comparable to the measuring time, no
direct estimate of the activity has been attempted.
– A second cleaning was made in the same sample in
order to assess its eﬀect on both the uranium and
the potassium content quantiﬁed. In this case the
baths were performed only with DI water (for one
week the sample was cleaned with DI water, changed
each day and heated to 60oC). The obtained results
(#36 of table 1), with no signiﬁcant change in the
derived activities, point to a null eﬀect of the new
procedure for both the 40K and U activities.

Following these results, alternative cleaning procedures
and even the possibility of etching kapton by plasma,
totally avoiding potassium compounds, are being stud-
ied. It is also worth noting that no indication of a pos-
sible 210Pb contamination has been found in any of the
measurements for this sample, as there is no excess over
background at the 46.5 keV peak.

A number of other samples involved in various Mi-
cromegas fabrication processes have also been measured
[14]. A sample of pyralux sheets, used in the construc-
tion of bulk Micromegas, showed good radiopurity ﬁrst
in germanium screening (#37 of table 1) and afterwards
using the BiPo-3 detector (#38 of table 1). This result
is of interest for the development of radiopure bulk Mi-
cromegas. A kapton-epoxy foil (AKAFLEX, from Krem-
pel GmbH) used in the microbulk fabrication process
(to join several kapton layers in more complex routing
designs) has been measured in BiPo-3 (#40 of table 1)
showing similar values to the previous samples. In ad-
dition, a sample of adhesive Isotac 3M VHB used in
Micromegas readouts has been screened with a germa-
nium detector (#39 of table 1) setting upper limits for
all the common radioisotopes. A sample of the stainless
steel mesh used in the bulk Micromegas ﬁrstly used in
TREX-DM (produced by Somacis) has been screened
(#41 of table 1) deriving only upper limits for all the
analyzed radioisotopes.

Alternative production procedures for Micromegas
are being explored. Two units of Micromegas (diam-
eter 10 cm, thickness 500 µm, made of Si covered by
silicon oxide SU8 and aluminum) produced at the Cen-
tro Nacional de Microelectronica, Barcelona, have been
screened (#42 of table 1). Upper limits have been set
for all the common radioisotopes, pointing to a radiop-
ure production process at CNM in this ﬁrst approach.

5 Background contributions

The main background sources have been simulated to
evaluate their contribution to the counting rate in the
region of interest for dark matter searches: radioactive
isotopes in the elements of the set-up, either primordial
or cosmogenically produced; radon-induced activity; and
backgrounds at the LSC including gamma-rays, muons
and neutrons. Concerning the measured activities, when-
ever diﬀerent values were obtained for the upper and
lower parts of the 238U and 232Th chains (see table 1),
they were properly considered in the corresponding sim-
ulations. The background levels quoted in the following
are referred to a Region of Interest (RoI) of 0.2-7 keVee;
the upper value is ﬁxed to avoid the interference from the
copper ﬂuorescence peak at 8.0 keV while the low energy
threshold assumed is equivalent to 1 keV for Ar and Ne
nuclear recoils. As made in [11], since the quenching fac-
tor of neither gaseous argon nor neon has been measured
yet, its parametrization in terms of the atom number and
mass number from [45] has been considered here. Results
for all the components included in the model and the dif-
ferent backgrounds at the laboratory are discussed in the
rest of this section; the rates are summarized in table 3
and ﬁgure 6 and the energy spectra in the low energy
region obtained for the dominant quantiﬁed internal ac-
tivities are shown in ﬁgure 7.

5.1 Intrinsic radioactivity

The simulation of the common radioactive isotopes, 40K
and those in the 238U and 232Th chains, from all the main
internal components (inside or close to the vessel) has
been scaled by the measured activities. Table 4 presents
the individual contribution of each of the isotopes in the
case of the considered Ne mixture (analogous results have
been obtained for the Ar mixture), to identify the most
relevant contributor for each simulated component of the
set-up. As shown in table 3, most of the screened com-
ponents ﬁnally used in the set-up have been considered;
it is worth noting that many of the reported values are
indeed upper limits to the estimated background rate as
only upper limits have been derived for the activity of
the corresponding element. The thorough selection pro-
cess of components and materials (described in section 4)
has allowed to reduce to non-relevant levels the contri-
butions of, for instance, PTFE components, ﬁeld cage
resistors or silicone connectors.

For the Micromegas readout planes, the measured
value for 40K activity before any special cleaning (as in
#31 of table 1) has been taken into account. It gives
a signiﬁcant rate and therefore the studies underway to
reduce this activity, probably related to the process of
creating holes, are very important.

Fig. 6 Background rates (in counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1) ex-
pected in the RoI (0.2-7 keVee) using Ar (blue bars) or Ne
(red bars) mixtures in TREX-DM, as shown in table 3. Rates
from contributions inside (top) and outside (bottom) the ves-
sel are depicted. Contributions estimated using quantiﬁed
background sources (not upper limits) are marked with *.

5.2 Cosmogenic activity

Cosmogenic activation of the set-up materials must be
taken into account too. Especially, that of the copper
vessel, due to its large mass, and the activation of the
gas medium itself.

5.2.1 Copper

Production rates of cosmogenic isotopes in copper have
been measured [46, 47] and evaluated using diﬀerent codes
[48, 49, 50, 51]; although there is a non-negligible disper-
sion in results, yields of tens of nuclei per kg and day
are expected for cobalt isotopes having long half-lives
(like 271.8 d for 57Co, 70.85 d for 58Co and 5.271 y
for 60Co). A simulation of the long-lived 60Co emissions
from the vessel and copper shields has been carried out.
As discussed in section 4.2.1, the cosmogenic activation
of the TREX-DM vessel (having a mass of ∼0.6 tons)
has been quantiﬁed thanks to the screening of a copper
sample having the same exposure history; this measured
60Co activity has been considered to evaluate its contri-
bution in the model, which is very relevant (see table 3).
The construction of a new vessel will allow to signiﬁ-
cantly suppress this contribution. For the inner copper

39Ar activity means a reduction factor of about 1400 in
comparison to the activity in atmospheric argon, which
is at the level of 1 Bq/kg. Therefore, following the esti-
mated contribution in table 3 for 39Ar, it is straightfor-
ward to conclude that for operation with atmospheric ar-
gon the background level of TREX-DM would be totally
dominated by this isotope, giving a rate of 219 counts
keV−1 kg−1 d−1 in the RoI. The contribution of 85Kr,
decaying also by beta-emission (Q=687 keV) with a half-
life of 10.76 y, has been estimated too, considering the
measured activity by DarkSide [52], even if cryogenic dis-
tillation is expected to help to remove eﬀectively 85Kr
from argon.

Among the diﬀerent radioactive isotopes that can be
induced, tritium in the detector medium could be a very
relevant background source for a dark matter experiment
due to its decay properties: it is a pure beta emitter with
Q=18.591 keV and a long half-life of 12.312 y. Follow-
ing the shape of the beta spectrum for the super-allowed
transition of 3H, 57% of the emitted electrons are in the
range from 1 to 7 keV; these electrons are fully absorbed
in most of the, typically large, dark matter detectors.
Some recent studies on tritium production in materials of
interest for dark matter experiments can be found in [48,
53, 51]; there are some estimates in argon but no informa-
tion for neon, and therefore a calculation of production
rates in these two targets (assuming their natural iso-
topic abundances) has been attempted, as presented in
[54].

The available information on the excitation function
by nucleons has been ﬁrstly collected, as shown in ﬁg-
ure 8: only one experimental result was found in the
EXFOR database [55] from [56] and cross sections were
taken from the TENDL-2013/2015 (TALYS-based Eval-
uated Nuclear Data Library) library [57] up to 150/ 200 MeV
and from the HEAD-2009 (High Energy Activation Data)
library [58] for higher energies up to 1000 MeV. Above
1 GeV, a constant production cross-section from the last
available energy has been assumed. For Ar, the excita-
tion functions from the two diﬀerent libraries used at
low and high energies match reasonably well. Since the
HEAD-2009 library does not provide results for Ne, the
last available cross-section value from TENDL-2013 has
been assumed for all the higher energies. Then, the pro-
duction rate was computed convoluting a selected exci-
tation function with the energy spectrum of cosmic neu-
trons at sea level, using the parametrization from [59],
following the diﬀerent approaches plotted in ﬁgure 8 [54].
The maximum and minimum rates obtained in these ap-
proaches deﬁne an interval, whose central value and half
width have been considered as the ﬁnal results and their
uncertainties for the evaluation of the production rates
of tritium in each target. Table 2 summarizes the pro-
duction rates obtained for Ar and Ne and presents other
results from the literature: the estimates in [48] using
TALYS 1.0 code and those in [51] based on GEANT4
simulation and ACTIVIA [50]. The rate in Ar only from
TENDL-2013 library below 150 MeV is 47.7 kg−1 d−1,

shielding (with a mass of ∼2 tons) and the copper boxes
shielding the connectors (42 kg), the activity correspond-
ing to 3 months of exposure to cosmic rays at sea level
and the saturation activity of (1.000±0.090) mBq/kg de-
duced in [46] has been considered; this contribution is not
relevant, as shown in table 3, thanks not only to the re-
duced cosmogenic activity but also to the shielding eﬀect
provided by the copper vessel for these emissions.

5.2.2 Gas

For the speciﬁc case of argon-based mixtures, the eﬀect
of 39Ar, which decays by beta-emission (Q=565 keV) and
has a long half-life (239 y), has been evaluated. It is pro-
duced at surface level by cosmogenic activation and the
best way to avoid it is extracting argon for underground
sources. The lowest activities have been obtained by the
DarkSide collaboration using this technique [52]; assum-
ing the measured activity from the DarkSide-50 data
of 0.73 mBq/kg, the contribution to TREX-DM back-
ground has been quantiﬁed (see table 3). This value of

which is in very good agreement with the value obtained
in [48], since the library is also based on TALYS code. It
is worth noting that the applied procedure to estimate
tritium production rates in Ar and Ne gives a very good
agreement with the measured rates by EDELWEISS and
CDMSlite experiments when applied to natural Ge [54].
Tritium emissions are fully absorbed in the gas pro-
ducing a signal indistinguishable from that of a dark mat-
ter interaction. If saturation activity was reached for tri-
tium, according to production rates in table 2, it would
dominate the expected background model with a contri-
bution of 15 and 22 counts keV−1 kg−1 day−1 for Ar and

Ne, respectively, in the RoI. However, tritium is expected
to be suppressed by puriﬁcation of gas and minimizing
exposure to cosmic rays of the puriﬁed gas should avoid
any problematic tritium activation. The ﬁrst experimen-
tal data in TREX-DM will be extremely useful to con-
ﬁrm that tritium production is not a relevant background
source for the experiment.

On the other hand, in TREX-DM, mixtures of Ar or
Ne with 1-2%iC4H10 at 10 b are foreseen; tritium could
be not only cosmogenically induced in the noble gas but
also be present in the isobutane. No speciﬁc information
about tritium content in isobutane has been found. As-
suming concentration as in water4, this would also give
a very relevant contribution in the RoI of TREX-DM of
22 and 84 counts keV−1 kg−1 day−1 for the considered
Ar and Ne mixtures, respectively. In any case, the obten-
tion of isobutane from underground gas sources, shielded
from cosmic rays, avoids a dangerous tritium content.

5.3 Radon-induced activity

A simulation of the 222Rn in the air surrounding the ves-
sel inside the copper shielding has been performed. The
measured activity at hall A of LSC of (63±1) Bq/m3 [40]
has been considered; the implementation of a N2 gas ﬂux
system inside the shielding to avoid radon intrusion pro-
viding a factor ∼100 reduction in the air 222Rn activity
allows to reduce this contribution to a non-relevant level
(see table 3). Even if radon inside the shielding has not
been directly quantiﬁed, the reduction factor assumed
here and in other experiments operated in Canfranc with
similar shielding and nitrogen ﬂux is supported by the
good agreement between models and measured data for
peaks due to 222Rn emissions [21]. In any case, this as-
sumption is not very relevant because if TREX-DM oper-
ates using the radon-free air facility available at the LSC
a bigger radon suppression factor at the level of about
1000 would be at reach.

An estimate of the contribution to the TREX-DM
background of a long exposure to air-borne radon of com-
ponents of the set-up has been attempted, evaluating the
eﬀect of the creation of a long-lived 210Pb contamination
and its progeny. This study has been carried out for the
copper vessel, having a large surface (∼1.4 m2) exposed
to a normal atmosphere for a long time, and for the inner
part of the copper shielding (∼2.9 m2). For the induced
210Pb activity on the copper surface, the upper limit set
from the screening of a sample of the vessel material de-
scribed in section 4.2.1 has been considered. It is worth
noting that the considered limit on 210Pb is ∼19 times
larger than the measured 210Po surface activity on an
ETP copper exposed to radon for years [61] and ∼10-30

4For natural surface waters there are about one tritium atom
per 1018 atoms of hydrogen, following Ref. [60]. The measured
tritium activity is some waters and the limits for drinking
water give indeed higher concentrations.

exposure to an activity of 15 Bq/m3 of 222Rn following
the results in [62],[63]; therefore, it is considered a very
conservative value. Emissions of 210Pb from the copper
surfaces have been simulated and, following results in
table 3, the contribution is not worrisome.

5.4 Gamma background

The environmental gamma ﬂux contribution from 238U,
232Th and 40K emissions has been evaluated by simulat-
ing the corresponding photons through the whole TREX-
DM set-up and scaling by the measured ﬂux in hall A
of LSC, as reported in [64]. Due to lack of statistics,
modest upper limits for the counting rate in the RoI
(0.2-7 keVee) at the level of 10-20 counts keV−1 kg−1
d−1) have been set from this simulation. But the 20-cm-
thick lead shielding together with the additional 11 cm
copper layer from vessel and inner shielding allows for a
reduction of several orders of magnitude of the environ-
mental gamma ﬂux and this contribution can be safely
neglected.

5.5 Muons

The muon contribution has been simulated assuming the
measured muon ﬂux at LSC of ∼ 4 × 10−3 s−1 m−2,
as in [65]. The muon energy spectrum evaluated for the
Canfranc depth (with mean energy of 216 GeV) and the
corresponding angular distribution have been considered
following [66]. Muons are launched from a virtual wall
through the whole TREX-DM set-up. The counting rate
derived in the RoI without applying any discrimination
method is high, but following the previous results de-
rived for TREX-DM by analyzing the signal topology
in [11], only 5.4 (3.4)% of events survive the cuts for
Argon (Neon); this makes the muon contribution non-
dominant (see table 3), even without the implementation
of a muon veto. It must be noted that the production of
neutrons by muons is implemented in the simulation and
therefore the contribution of these high energy neutrons
produced in the lead shielding is included in the back-
ground level reported for muons.

5.6 Neutrons

The eﬀect of neutrons from other origins has been ana-
lyzed for TREX-DM too. First, environmental neutrons
at LSC have been simulated from a virtual sphere con-
taining the set-up with the 40-cm-thick moderator and
the results have been normalized to the neutron ﬂux mea-
sured at LSC in [67] (similar to that presented in [68]);
the evaporation spectrum has been considered for the
neutron energy sampling. A preliminary analysis of the
tracks left in the chamber points to a rejection factor

15

of ∼10% of the events in the RoI. The obtained rates
are shown in table 3; the neutron moderator makes the
contribution from these neutrons irrelevant. Concerning
muon-induced neutrons in the rock surrounding the labo-
ratory, the expected ﬂux is ∼3 orders of magnitude lower
than that of the environmental neutrons [68].

Radiogenic neutrons produced by (α,n) reactions due
to 238U and 232Th primordial impurities (or spontaneous
ﬁssion of the former) in the set-up materials are other of
the neutron sources of background in WIMP direct de-
tection experiments. In particular, neutrons having also
an evaporation spectrum have been simulated from the
lead shielding and the copper vessel to evaluate the con-
tribution from the ﬁssion of their 238U contaminations.
The information on this isotope activity for copper and
lead presented in table 1 has been considered together
with the values of (2.4±0.2) neutrons per ﬁssion and
(5.45±0.04)×10−7 ﬁssions per decay [69]. The deduced
counting rates, shown in table 3, are negligible.

Additionally, an estimate of the contribution of these
radiogenic neutrons in other materials of the TREX-DM
set-up has been attempted using a simulation of neutrons
having a ﬁssion energy spectrum and calculating the ex-
pected neutron rate from neutron yields estimated in
previous works for the materials. In particular, neutron
yields for copper, steel, teﬂon and polyethylene from [70]
have been used; yields for Ar and Ne are available in [71].
Results in [70] were obtained using the SOURCES4A
code with (α,n) reaction cross-sections calculated using
EMPIRE2.19, while calculations in [71] are based on
cross-sections obtained with the TALYS code. Secular
equilibrium in the natural chains is assumed in both ref-
erences. Yields in [70] include also spontaneous ﬁssion of
238U. In [71] it is reported that there is no (α,n) neu-
tron yield in lead due to a very high Coulomb barrier.
A code (NeuCBOT) for computation of neutron yields
and the corresponding estimates for diﬀerent materials
have been presented too in [72]; it is based on TALYS
for cross sections and uses ENSDF for alpha decay data
and SRIM code for considering the stopping power of
alpha particles. It is reported that NeuCBOT tends to
predict yields systematically higher by ∼30% than other
calculations based on SOURCES4A or available mea-
sured yields. Table 5 summarizes the considered neutron
yields and the corresponding estimated counting rates in
TREX-DM. The whole mass of each material in the set-
up has been considered: copper in vessel, small compo-
nents and shielding structure, teﬂon from ﬁeld cage and
other components, steel in the shielding structure and
polyethylene used as neutron moderator. The following
activities for 238U and 232Th (using the highest value
of those corresponding to the diﬀerent isotopes in the
chain, if available) have been assumed: the deduced val-
ues for TREX-DM for copper and teﬂon (#2 and #13
in table 1), measured values for S275 steel (as used in
TREX-DM shielding structure) by NEXT [43] and upper
limits derived by ICPMS for both U and Th in polyethy-
lene (from a diﬀerent supplier) by NEXT [73]. As shown

16

in table 5, neutrons from steel are the most relevant; the
upper limit to the total estimated contribution to the
background rate is of the order of 10−3 counts keV−1
kg−1 d−1, and therefore, it can be concluded that radio-
genic neutrons are not a dominant background source
for TREX-DM. This contribution is also shown in ta-
ble 3. No reference of U and Th content in the gases (Ar
or Ne) is available; but it has been checked, using the
yields in [71], that concentrations of U and Th about
1 ppm would be required to produce rates at the level of
10−3 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1 comparable to those from
the other materials.

The contribution from muons and environmental neu-
trons is under control in the simulated conditions, follow-
ing the rates in table 3. Although the precise estimates
of some external background sources are still underway,
it seems that the designed shielding is enough to reduce
to non-relevant levels the corresponding contribution.

6 Sensitivity prospects

For completeness, a ﬁrst estimate of the achievable sen-
sitivity in the search for low mass WIMPs is presented in
this section in order to assess the eﬀect of the background
conditions evaluated and the expected detector perfor-
mance. Figure 9 presents the attainable exclusion plots
(90% C.L.) in the direct detection of WIMPs, for both Ar
and Ne-based gas mixtures at 10 bar, obtained assum-
ing spin independent (SI) interaction and standard val-
ues of the WIMP halo model with Maxwell-Boltzmann
velocity distribution and astrophysical parameters (local
dark matter density 0.3 GeV/c2, local velocity 220 km/s,
laboratory velocity 232 km/s and galactic escape veloc-
ity 544 km/s). The projected exclusion curves have been
derived as in [11], assuming the background is properly
accounted for by the background model and statistically
subtracted. Three diﬀerent scenarios (labeled as A, B and
C) for ﬂat-shaped background, energy threshold and ex-
posure have been considered (see table 6). Despite the
peak at ∼3 keV appearing in the RoI due to the 40K ac-
tivity in the readout planes (see ﬁgure 7), the ﬂat back-
ground assumption is reasonable as the exclusion plot is
mainly determined by the lowest energy bins just above
the energy threshold; in addition, works are underway
to suppress this background contribution. A data-taking
campaign of approximately three years is foreseen, start-
ing with Ne with the option to change to depleted Ar.
It can be seen that even in the ﬁrst stage of TREX-DM
with a small-scale set-up there is an option to explore
regions of WIMPs uncovered by other experiments.

Following the rates summarized in table 3, the back-
ground assumed in scenario A gives the worst expecta-
tion. To achieve the level considered in scenario B, a
reduction of the two main contributions from the quan-
tiﬁed present activities should be enough. On one hand,
as discussed in section 4.2.4, work is underway to reduce
the 40K content of the microbulk Micromegas readout
and from the available results a reduction factor of ∼4
has been already achieved (see table 1). On the other
hand, a new copper vessel produced using fresh copper
and limiting exposure to cosmic rays at sea level to one
month would have a 60Co activity of 0.01 mBq/kg (from
the saturation activity deduced in [46]), giving a rate
of 0.06(0.07) counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1 for Ar(Ne), which
would mean a reduction by a factor 22 respect to the
present copper vessel. The scenario B is interesting for

Fig. 9 90% C.L. sensitivity of TREX-DM under three dif-
ferent conditions for background level, energy threshold and
exposure, summarized in table 6, for Ar+1%iC4H10 (black
lines) and Ne+2%iC4H10 (green lines). The closed contours
shown correspond to results from CDMS-II Si [74] (blue, 90%
C.L.), CoGeNT [2] (dark gray, 90% C.L.), CRESST-II [75]
(magenta, 95% C.L.), and DAMA/LIBRA [76] (yellow, 90%
C.L.). The brown shaded region corresponds to the sensitivity
limit imposed by the solar neutrino coherent scattering back-
ground [77]. As a reference, 90% C.L. exclusion limits from
diﬀerent experiments are also shown: CRESST-II 2016 [6]
(dark blue), CDMSlite [5] (purple), DAMIC [3] (light blue),
EDELWEISS [7] and SuperCDMS [78] (yellow) and DarkSide
[9] and NEWS-G [10] (red).

Ne as for WIMP masses below 2 GeV/c2 the sensitivity
is beyond current bounds.

The background level considered in scenario C, pre-
dicting the stringent exclusion plots, appears as a plau-
sible future goal. Several individual contributions are at
the level of 0.1 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1: those of connec-
tors, radon in air, muons and 39Ar for Ar. New connec-
tors already screened (see results at #19 of table 1) would
guarantee more than one order of magnitude of reduction
for this contribution. Moreover, this background contri-
bution could be totally suppressed if the new connection
approach being tested is successful; multi-channel con-
nectors can be replaced by a new custom-made “face-to-
face” contact technique oﬀering in addition a substan-
tial improvement in the level of connectivity. This sys-
tem has been designed, manufactured, installed and it is
presently being checked. The use of a muon veto system
or a speciﬁc, more eﬃcient, muon discrimination analy-
sis together with the use of air from the radon-free air
factory in operation in Canfranc oﬀering an overall re-
duction factor of ∼1000 in the radon activity would also
help to reduce these external contributions.

The TREX-DM experiment intends to look for low mass
WIMPs using a Micromegas-read High Pressure TPC
ﬁlled with Ar or Ne mixtures in the Canfranc Under-
ground Laboratory. At the beginning of 2019, it is at the
commissioning phase and the data taking is expected
to start soon using Ne+2%iC4H10. Together with a sub-
keVee energy threshold, an ultra-low background level at
the lowest energy region is mandatory; an assessment of
the expected background has been performed to help in
the selection of radiopure components during the design
phase and to support a reliable estimate of the experi-
ment sensitivity. The background contributions, taking
into consideration all the known sources, have been sim-
ulated by means of a dedicated Geant4 application and a
custom-made code implementing the detector response.
A material radioassay campaign has been carried out,
based on germanium spectrometry at LSC and comple-
mentary measurements, to quantify the activity of all
the relevant elements in the experiment set-up (see ta-
ble 1). The total expected background level from the
internal activity should be below 6.1(6.6) counts keV−1
kg−1 d−1 for Ar(Ne), as shown in table 3; from that,
70(64)% come from activities actually quantiﬁed. One
of the largest contributions is due to the copper vessel,
cosmogenically activated after being a few years at sea
level, as shown in a dedicated germanium measurement.
This important contribution could be suppressed by con-
structing a new vessel. The measured 40K activity in the
Micromegas readout gives also a signiﬁcant rate and for
this reason new treatments are being analyzed in an at-
tempt to reduce this activity. It must be noted that the
use of underground argon has been assumed, consider-
ing the 39Ar activity measured by DarkSide [52]. It has
been veriﬁed that a saturation activity of tritium in the
gas media could be very relevant, but the gas puriﬁca-
tion and obtention from underground sources will avoid
in principle this contribution. The eﬀect of radon and
radon-induced activity on copper surfaces has been as-
sessed, ﬁnding it non-dominant at the present phase. The
contribution from muons and environmental neutrons is
under control in the simulated conditions, thanks to the
background rejection capabilities and the shielding. All
in all, in the presently assumed conditions, the TREX-
DM expected background can be considered between 1
and 10 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1; a few improvements have
been identiﬁed and are being tested in an attempt to
further decrease it down to 0.1 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1,
which would provide a competitive sensitivity in the di-
rect detection of low mass WIMPs.
