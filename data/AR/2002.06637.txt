ABSTRACT
Deep learning speech separation algorithms have achieved great suc-
cess in improving the quality and intelligibility of separated speech
from mixed audio. Most previous methods focused on generating
a single-channel output for each of the target speakers, hence dis-
carding the spatial cues needed for the localization of sound sources
in space. However, preserving the spatial information is impor-
tant in many applications that aim to accurately render the acous-
tic scene such as in hearing aids and augmented reality (AR). Here,
we propose a speech separation algorithm that preserves the inter-
aural cues of separated sound sources and can be implemented with
low latency and high ﬁdelity, therefore enabling a real-time mod-
iﬁcation of the acoustic scene. Based on the time-domain audio
separation network (TasNet), a single-channel time-domain speech
separation system that can be implemented in real-time, we propose
a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) end-to-end extension of TasNet
that takes binaural mixed audio as input and simultaneously sepa-
rates target speakers in both channels. Experimental results show
that the proposed end-to-end MIMO system is able to signiﬁcantly
improve the separation performance and keep the perceived location
of the modiﬁed sources intact in various acoustic scenes.

1. INTRODUCTION

In real-world multi-talker acoustic environments, humans can easily
separate speech and accurately perceive the location of each speaker
due to the binaural acoustic features such as interaural time differ-
ences (ITDs) and interaural level differences (ILDs). Speech pro-
cessing methods aimed to modify the acoustic scene are therefore
required to not only separate sound sources, but do so in a way to
preserve the spatial cues needed for accurate localization of sounds.
However, most of the binaural speech separation systems [1–3]
are multi-input-single-output (MISO), and hence lose the interau-
ral cues at the output level which are important for humans to per-
form sound lateralization and localization [4, 5]. To achieve binaural
speech separation as well as interaural cues preservation, the multi-
input-multi-output (MIMO) setting is necessary, and currently, such
setting can be divided into three main categories.

The ﬁrst category of methods add another stage for binaural
sound rendering, such as head related transfer function (HRTF) hy-
potheses, after a MISO system [6]. This method decouples speech
separation and spatial cues preservation, however, it requires robust
speaker localization algorithms and a priori knowledge about the
HRTF of the listener [7]. Thus, it not only requires additional ef-
forts but limits the system to be listener-dependent.

The second category calculates a real-valued spectro-temporal
mask and then applies the same mask to both left and right micro-
phone channels [6, 8–12]. Because both sides obtain the same zero-
phase gain, the original interaural cues are preserved. However,

the separation performance may be limited because of the single-
channel mask estimation and the constraint due to the same gain
assumption.

In the third category, complex-valued ﬁlters are applied to all
available microphone signals simultaneously to generate binaural
outputs with an additional constraint on interaural cues preservation.
One approach is to use two beamformers at the same time to gener-
ate left and right outputs respectively, such as generalized sidelobe
canceller (GSC) [13] and binaural minimum variance distortionless
response (MVDR) beamformer [14]. Another approach is multi-
channel wiener ﬁlter (MWF) [15] that is equivalent to the combi-
nation of spatial ﬁltering and spectral post-ﬁltering. There has been
a method that exploits the deep neural network to estimate complex
ideal ratio masks (cIRM) for both left and right channels [16]. Since
these multi-channel methods aim at estimating the desired separated
sources in each channel, the spatial information could be naturally
preserved.

One common issue for the systems mentioned above is that the
system latency can be perceivable by humans, and the delayed play-
back of the separated speakers might affect the localization of the
signals due to the precedence effect [17]. To decrease the system
latency while maintaining the separation quality, a natural way is to
use time-domain separation methods with smaller windows. Recent
deep learning-based time-domain separation systems have proven
their effectiveness in achieving high separation quality and decreas-
ing the system latency [18–21], however, all those systems are still
MISO and their ability to perform binaural speech separation and
interaural cues preservation is not fully addressed.

In this paper, we look into multiple methods for formulating
such systems into MIMO systems and investigate their capability
of high-quality separation and interaural cue preservation. Based on
the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet) [20], we pro-
pose a MIMO TasNet that takes binaural mixture signals as input
and simultaneously separates speech in both channels, then the sep-
arated signals can be directly rendered to the listener without post-
processing. The MIMO TasNet exploits a parallel encoder to extract
cross-channel information for mask estimation and uses mask-and-
sum method to perform spatial and spectral ﬁltering for better sep-
aration performance. We compare it with other variants of TasNet
in the tasks. Experiment results show that MIMO TasNet can per-
form listener-independent speech separation across a wide range of
speaker angles and preserve both ITD and ILD features with signif-
icantly higher quality than the single-channel baseline. Moreover,
the minimum system latency of the systems can be less than 5 ms,
showing the potentials for the actual deployment of such systems
into real-world hearable devices.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the
problem deﬁnition of binaural separation with preserved spatial cues
and the MIMO variants of TasNet in Section 2, describe the experi-
ment settings in Section 3, discuss the results in Section 4, and con-
cludes the paper in Section 5.

channels, and the encoder outputs for each channel are concatenated together and passed to a mask estimation network. Then, spectral-
temporal and spatial ﬁltering are performed by applying the masks to the corresponding encoder outputs and sum them up on both left and
right paths. Finally, binaural separated speech are reconstructed by a linear decoder.

SEPARATION

2.1. Problem deﬁnition

The problem of binaural speech separation is formulated as the sep-
aration of C sources sl,r
i (t) ∈ R1×T , i = 1, . . . , C from the bin-
aural mixtures xl(t), xr(t) ∈ R1×T , where the superscripts l and
r denote the left and right channels, respectively. For preserving
the interaural cues in the outputs, we consider the case where every
single source signal is transformed by a set of head-related impulse
response (HRIR) ﬁlters for a speciﬁc listener:

(cid:40)

i = ˆsi (cid:126) hl
sl

i = ˆsi (cid:126) hr

i = 1, . . . , C

is the monaural signal of source i, hl

where ˆsi ∈ R1×T (cid:48)
i ∈
R1×(T −T (cid:48)+1) are the pair of HRIR ﬁlters corresponding to the
source i, and (cid:126) represents the convolution operation. Using the
HRIR-transformed signals as the separation targets forces the model
to preserve interaural cues introduced by the HRIR ﬁlters, and the
outputs can be directly rendered to the listener.

2.2. MIMO TasNet

2.2.1. TasNet overview

TasNet has been shown to achieve superior separation performance
in single-channel mixtures [20]. TasNet contains three modules:
a linear encoder ﬁrst transforms the mixture waveform into a two-
dimensional representation similar to spectrograms; a separator es-
timates C multiplicative functions similar to time-frequency masks
based on the 2-D representation; and a linear decoder transforms the
C target source representations back to waveforms.

Various approaches have been proposed to extend TasNet into

the multi-channel framework [22, 23]. A standard pipeline is to
incorporate cross-channel features into the single-channel model,
where spatial features such as interaural phase difference (IPD) is
concatenated with the mixture encoder output on a selected refer-
ence microphone for mask estimation [22].
In various scenarios,
such conﬁguration have led to a signiﬁcantly better separation per-
formance than the signal-channel TasNet.

2.2.2. Design of MIMO TasNet

The proposed MIMO TasNet uses a parallel encoder for spectro-
temporal and spatial features extraction and a mask-and-sum mech-
anism for source separation. A primary encoder is always applied
to the channel to be separated, and a secondary encoder is applied
to the other channel to jointly extract cross-channel features.
In
other words, the sequential order of the encoders determines which
channel (left of right) the separated outputs belong to. The out-
puts of the two encoders are concatenated and passed to the sepa-
rator, and 2C multiplicative functions are estimated for the C tar-
get speakers. C multiplicative functions are applied to the primary
encoder output while the other C multiplicative functions are ap-
plied to the secondary encoder output, and the two multiplied results
are then summed to create representations for C separated sources.
We denote it as the mask-and-sum mechanism to distinguish it from
the other methods where only C multiplicative functions were esti-
mated from the separation module and applied to only the reference
channel. Similar to TasNet, a linear decoder transforms the C tar-
get source representations back to waveforms. Figure 1 shows the
ﬂowchart of the system design.

Note that a parallel encoder design for multi-channel TasNet has
been discussed in a previous literature [22]. For a N -channel input,
N encoders were applied to each of them and the encoder outputs
were summed to create a single representation. The multiplicative
function was also estimated on the single representation, which re-

sulted in a MISO system design. We can easily ﬁnd that it is a special
case of MIMO TasNet where the two multiplicative functions for the
two encoders are equal. Although in [22] an on par performance
with respect to the feature concatenation method was reported for
the parallel encoder design, in Section 4 we will show that MIMO
TasNet is able to signiﬁcantly surpass feature concatenation TasNet
in various conﬁgurations in both separation performance and spatial
cue preservation accuracy.

2.2.3. Training objective

Scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) [24] is used as
both the evaluation metric and training objective for many recent
end-to-end separation systems. SI-SDR between a signal x ∈ R1×T
and its estimate ˆx ∈ R1×T is deﬁned as:

SI-SDR(x, ˆx) = 10 log10

(cid:18) ||αx||2

2

(cid:19)

||ˆx − αx||2
2

(2)

where α = ˆxx(cid:62)/xx(cid:62) corresponds to the rescaling factor. Although
SI-SDR is able to implicitly incorporate the ITD information, the
scale-invariance property of SI-SDR makes it insensitive to power
rescaling of the estimated signal, which may fail in preserving the
ILD between the outputs. Hence instead of using SI-SDR as the
training objective, we use the plain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) de-
ﬁned as:

SNR(x, ˆx) = 10 log10

(cid:18) ||x||2

(cid:19)

||ˆx − x||2

3.2. Evaluation metrics

We evaluate the model with both the separation quality and the abil-
ity to preserve interaural cues. SNR improvement (SNRi) is used
as the signal quality metric instead of SI-SDR improvement accord-
ing to our discussion in Section 2.2.3. ITD and ILD errors between
the separated and target clean signals are used as the metric for the
accuracy of preserving interaural cues, which are deﬁned as:

where ¯sl, ¯sr ∈ R1×T are the separated signals in left and right
channels, respectively, sl, sr ∈ R1×T are the corresponding tar-
get signals, and || · || denotes the L2-norm of the signal. We use
generalized cross-correlation phase transform (GCC-PHAT) algo-
rithm [27] to compute time difference of arrival (TDOA) of sl and
sr as ITD(sl, sr). The tool is available online 2.

3.3. Network architectures

The conﬁgurations of the MIMO TasNet variants are based on the
causal setting of the single-channel TasNet [20]. We use 64 ﬁlters in
the linear encoder and decoder with 2 ms ﬁlter length (i.e. 16 sam-
ples at 8k Hz). In the causal temporal convolutional network (TCN),
there are 4 repeated stacks and each one includes 8 1-D convolu-
tional blocks. The number of parameters in all models are aligned to
1.67M for a fair comparison.

For baseline models, we adopt the following conﬁgurations:

3. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

3.1. Dataset

We generated an anechoic speech dataset from the WSJ0-2mix
dataset [25]. 30 hours of training data, 10 hours of validation data
and 5 hours of test data were generated with the same conﬁguration
as the single-channel WSJ0-2mix data, while the clean speech are
convolved with randomly sampled HRIR ﬁlters from the CIPIC
HRTF Database [7]. The CIPIC HRTF Database contains real-
recorded HRIR ﬁlters for 20 subjects across 25 different interaural-
polar azimuths from −80◦ to 80◦ and 50 different interaural-polar
elevations from −90◦ to 270◦. We randomly sampled two speaker
locations in the database for spatial rendering. We used 27 subjects
for training and validation sets and 9 unseen subjects for test set,
ensuring that the model is evaluated in a listener-independent way.
All mixtures were downsampled to 8k Hz.

Anechoic WSJ0-3mix dataset with spatial cues was generated
by using the the same method as above. To generate noisy WSJ0-
2mix dataset, we added to the training set the noise from one out
of eight environmental noises (washing room, kitchen, sport ﬁeld,
city park, ofﬁce, meeting room) chosen from DEMAND dataset [26]
with SNR between -15 and 2.5 dB. The noise in test set is from
another eight scenarios (subway station, restaurant, public square,
trafﬁc intersection, subway, private car). To generate echoic WSJ0-
2mix dataset, HRIR ﬁlters are obtained from the BRIR Sim Set1,
which is simulated with different reverberation time (T60). We use
rooms with T60 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.5s, 0.7s, 0.8s, 1.0s for training and
0.3s, 0.6s, 0.9s for testing.

to each channel independently.

2. Feature concatenation TasNet: cross-channel features are
concatenated to the encoder output in the same way as [22].
We use sin(IPD), cos(IPD) and ILD as spatial features, where
the IPD and ILD are deﬁned as

IPD(X, Y) = ∠X − ∠Y
ILD(X, Y) = 10 log10 (|X| (cid:11) |Y|)
where X, Y are the spectrograms of the two channel mix-
tures, (cid:11) means element-wise division. The window length of
STFT for calculating spectrograms is 256 samples.

which is also discussed in Section 2.2.2.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Table 2 compares different MIMO TasNet variants at various speaker
locations on anechoice spatialized WSJ0-2mix. The single-channel
baseline is able to achieve the smallest ILD error across all mod-
els when the speaker angle is very small, which indicates that the
interaural features in this scenario are not helpful in preserving the
absolute energy of the separated speech. For all other speaker lo-
cations, both the ILD error and separation quality for the single-
channel model are signiﬁcantly worse than all the MIMO variants.
For TasNet concatenated with sin(IPD), cos(IPD) and ILD features,
we can observe signiﬁcant signal quality improvement and ITD/ILD
error reduction across all angle ranges, and better performance is

achieved with larger speaker angle. This conﬁrms the previous ob-
servations regarding the effectiveness of cross-channel features in
end-to-end frameworks [22]. The parallel encoder method has on
par performance in preserving ITD/ILD with feature concatenation
method, but achieves better separation performance except when the
speaker angle is small (less than 15°). The signiﬁcant improvement
for signal quality (SNRi) indicates that the parallel encoders are able
to implicitly extract more effective cross-channel features than cross-
domain features IPD/ILD for multi-channel speech separation. The
further improvement from mask-and-sum mechanism indicates the
effectiveness of combining spatial ﬁltering and spectral ﬁltering to
separate sources. The correlation (Pearsons r) between SNRi and
∆IT D and between SNRi and ∆ILD are -0.77 and -0.85, respec-
tively (p <0.0001 for both), which means higher separated signal
quality helps in preserving ITD/ILD better.

To further examine our proposed MIMO TasNet in more adverse
environments, we tested the separation accuracy in three speaker
mixtures, noisy speech separation and speech separation with room
reverberation. Note that in the evaluation of these three cases, top
5% ∆IT D and ∆ILD were dropped before averaging to prevent the
errors incurred by outliers.

When testing the model on noisy WSJ0-2mix dataset, we set the
noise power range at three levels. As shown in Table 2, additive
noise contaminates both speech quality and ITD/ILD preservation,
but the overall performance compared to the clean condition is still
superior and MIMO TasNet with parallel encoder and mask-and-sum
achieves the best performance in all metrics across all noise levels,
which proves the MIMO TasNet is more robust to the noise.

We observe that three speaker separation is more challenging
than noisy speech separation. Both ITD and ILD preservation down-
grade signiﬁcantly than the two-speaker case. That’s because the
model had failed to separate some of speech with very small power
compared to the other two speakers or speech with very similar spa-
tial features to others, and the failure of separation leads to the failure
of ITD/ILD preservation.

Finally, we evaluated the model on the echoic spatialized WSJ0-

2mix dataset. The target is the reverberant clean signal. Not surpris-
ingly, convolutive room reverberation is a more challenging condi-
tion than additive environmental noises both in terms of signal qual-
ity improvement and preserving spatial cues as the sparseness prop-
erties of the speech is affected by room reverberation. The smearing
casued by reverberation means that the mixture at each instance in-
cludes components of the same and different speakers, which makes
the mask prediction and TDOA estimation more difﬁcult. As a re-
sult, SNRi and ∆IT D are more easily affected by the reverbera-
tion. Also, using only two channels doesn’t fully take advantage
of multi-channel algorithms to reduce the inﬂuence of reverberation.
Nonetheless, averaged 9.4 dB SNR improvement, 5.9 µs ITD error
and 0.23 dB ILD error shows that the performance of MIMO TasNet
is still helpful in the moderate reverberant environment.

5. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we investigated the problem of real-time binaural
speech separation with interaural cues preservation. We proposed
a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) TasNet
that uses a parallel
encoder and mask-and-sum mechanism to improve performance.
Experimental results show that the MIMO TasNet is able to achieve
signiﬁcantly better separation performance and has the ability to
preserve interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level dif-
ference (ILD) features in the separated outputs compared to the
other existing variants of TasNet. Future works include adapting to
environmental noise and room reverberation and incorporate extra
microphones for obtaining more cross-channel information, which
can pave the way to real-world speech separation solutions for
acoustic scene modiﬁcation.
