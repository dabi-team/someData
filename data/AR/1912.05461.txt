Abstract: DarkSide is a staged experimental project based on radiopure argon aiming at direct
dark matter detection. The DarkSide-50 (DS-50) detector is currently operating underground at
the Gran Sasso National Laboratory. DS-50 detector is a dual-phase, 50 kg, liquid argon time-
projection-chamber readout by 38 cryogenic PMTs (Hamamatsu R11065), surrounded by an active
liquid scintillator veto and contained in a water Cherenkov detector acting as a muon veto.
DS-50 has been been operating continuously since 2013, ﬁrst with atmospheric argon and subse-
quently ﬁlled in 2015 with argon from an underground source, allowing a reduction of the 39Ar
isotope by more than a factor 1000.
Features of the DS-50 detector are described, long term operations and stability are reported and
its performances in scintillation light detection discussed. Results on dark matter searches obtained
with DarkSide-50 detector are brieﬂy reported.

Keywords: Liquid argon; Noble liquid detectors (scintillation, ionization, double-phase); Dark
Matter detectors (WIMPs, axions, etc.)

Introduction

The existence of an unknown nature form of matter, called dark matter, has been shown by diﬀerent
astronomical and cosmological evidences, indicating that only a little fraction of the matter of the
Universe is composed of ordinary baryonic matter. Proofs of the possible presence of dark matter
have been found coming from several and independent investigations in diﬀerent ﬁelds of research.
A favored hypothesis that explains these observations is that dark matter is made of Weakly Inter-
acting Massive Particles (WIMPs). A great eﬀort is then currently devoted to ﬁnd some evidence
of these new particles [1–4].
Direct dark matter search experiments look for an excess of signals in an underground, low back-
ground environment; diﬀerent detectors have been built for this purpose, with the aim to measure
small energy depositions (1÷100 keV). The use of liquiﬁed noble gases (neon, argon and xenon) as
sensitive medium is one of the most promising direct detection techniques to perform this search.
Argon in particular, due to its features as high scintillation photon yield, powerful background
rejection through eﬃcient event discrimination methods, ease of puriﬁcation and high abundance
at reasonable cost, represents an ideal medium for the WIMPs detection.
In direct dark matter search scenario a leading role is played by the DarkSide (DS) project based
on ultrapure depleted argon.

2 The DarkSide program

The DarkSide program has been designed with the aim of direct dark matter detection via WIMP-
nucleus scattering in liquid argon (LAr) at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, using a dual-phase LAr

– 1 –

Time Projection Chamber (TPC), with scalable, zero-background technology [5, 6].
The two-phase (liquid-gas) technology is based on the simultaneous detection of both signals
produced by ionization events in liquid argon: free electron charge and scintillation light. In fact,
particles interacting in LAr create free electrons and excited Ar molecular states which produce
scintillation radiation through de-excitation processes. The two processes are complementary and
their relative weight depends on the strength of the electric ﬁeld applied to the active LAr volume
[7–9]. The main feature of the LAr technology in the direct dark matter search is the capability to
eﬃciently separate nuclear recoil (NR) events, as expected from WIMP interactions, from electron
recoil (ER) events.
In general, the largest challenge in searching for dark matter is the suppression of the rate of
background events to below the very low WIMP interaction rates (a few events per ton×year) to
which current dark matter experiments are sensitive. In the case of the LAr technology, one of the
main drawback is the presence of the cosmogenically produced β-emitter (with a half-life of 269
years) radioactive isotope of 39Ar in natural atmospheric argon (AAr) with an intrinsic activity of
∼1 Bq/kg, end-point of the β spectrum at 565 keV and mean energy at 220 keV [10]. The low energy
electrons show an energy in the range of the interest for a WIMP search and can become a problem
for larger detectors. Therefore the reduction of 39Ar content represents a crucial requirement for
large scale LAr dark matter detector. To this purpose a particular eﬀort has been dedicated in
procuring argon from underground reservoirs: underground argon (UAr), protected from cosmic
ray activation, is signiﬁcantly reduced in 39Ar content at least of 2÷3 orders of magnitude respect
to the AAr [11, 12].
The DarkSide project foresees a multi-stage approach and after a ﬁrst operation of a 10 kg detector
has been carried out [13], the DarkSide-50 (DS-50) detector has been operating underground in the
Hall C of LNGS since 2013. After a ﬁrst step with the TPC detector initially ﬁlled with the AAr
[14], the DS-50 ﬁlled with argon derived from underground sources (with a 46 kg ﬁducial mass
TPC) is still currently running after reaching a background-free dark matter search with a sensitivity
of 1.14×10−44 cm2 for a 100 GeV WIMP mass [15].
The next step of the project foresees to proceed towards a multi-ton detector and a sensitivity
improvement of about three orders of magnitude.

3 The DarkSide-50 detector

The DarkSide-50 experiment is composed by three nested detectors (see Figure 1 [Left]): innermost
is the LAr TPC, acting as dark matter detector containing the liquid argon target, housed by the
organic Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV), serving as shielding and as anti-coincidence for radiogenic
and cosmogenic neutrons, γ-rays and cosmic muons and the most externally Water Cherenkov
Detector (WCD), acting as a shield and as anti-coincidence for cosmic muons [14, 16].
The TPC is made by a high reﬂectivity PTFE square cylinder (36 cm diameter by 36 cm height)
with 46 kg active volume, viewed by 38 (19 at bottom and 19 on the top) Hamamatsu HQE R11065
3” PMTs. The top of the active volume is deﬁned by a stainless steel grid, allowing for setting the
drift and extraction ﬁelds independently. The gas pocket above the active volume is 1 cm thick.
Two fused silica windows coated with transparent conductor, ITO, forming the anode and cathode
surfaces, are respectively placed at the top and at the bottom of the PTFE chamber. Field shaping

– 2 –

copper rings outside the TPC ensure a uniform electric ﬁeld inside the LAr active volume. All
inner surfaces are coated with the wavelength shifter tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) shifting the VUV
128 nm LAr scintillation light to visible 420 nm light detected by the PMTs (see Figure 1 [Right]).
Ionizing particles interacting in the sensitive LAr volume of the detector deposit energy inducing
both a prompt scintillation and ionization. The scintillation light represents the primary pulse
signal S1. The ionization electrons are drifted upwards by an electric ﬁeld (200 V/cm) to the
liquid surface where they are extracted into a gas pocket by a higher electric ﬁeld (2.8 kV/cm).
The acceleration of the electrons across the gas pocket produces a secondary electroluminescence
scintillation signal S2, proportional to the number of ionization electrons. The S1 and S2 pulses
enable 3D position reconstruction of the primary interaction site: the time between S1 and S2 gives
the vertical position, and the hit pattern of the S2 light on the photosensors gives the transverse
position. The 3D position reconstruction allows for rejection of surface backgrounds.
The Liquid Scintillator Veto surrounding the TPC is a 4 m diameter stainless steel sphere ﬁlled
with a mixture of pseudocumene and trimethyl-borate (TMB). The content of 10B in the scintillator
provides a large neutron capture cross section. The LSV is instrumented with 110 Hamamatsu R5912
8” PMTs; it acts as an active veto to tag neutrons in the TPC and for allowing for measurement of
the neutron background directly in situ. A Water Cherenkov Detector, made by an 11 m diameter
by 10 m height water tank surrounds the LSV; it is equipped with 80 ETL 9351 8” PMTs and forms
an active muon veto to tag cosmogenic induced neutrons. Both the LSV and the WCD provide
passive neutron and gamma shielding for the TPC.

4 DarkSide-50 stability and performances

The DS-50 detector has been almost continuously running and taking data since 2013. A good
stability of the DS-50 TPC detector has been shown in terms of thermodynamic parameters of
cryogenic system, PMTs parameters, electric ﬁelds, light yield and liquid argon purity. An active
slow control allows for the set of the cryogenic system serving the TPC detector where the thermo-
dynamic parameters (pressure, argon and nitrogen ﬂows, heating power, argon puriﬁcation, etc.)
are routinely checked, monitored and stored. The main feartures of the 38 TPC PMTs are daily
checked via laser calibration to estimate the gains (through the single electron response - SER),
the SER resolution, the PMTs QE’s, rates, voltage supplies and currents. The evaluation of the
TPC light yield (LY) at null ﬁeld and at 200 V/cm has been performed by using data from a 83mKr
source with the TPC ﬁlled with both atmospheric and underground argon. In the Figure 2 [Left]
the resulting spectrum as convolution of 39Ar and 83mKr sources during the AAr campaign has
been reported; it has been ﬁt to obtain the measurement of the light yield of the detector at the
41.5 keV reference line of 83mKr. The ﬁt of the overall spectrum, accounting for both the 39Ar
and 83mKr contributions, returns a light yield, expressed in photoelectron (PE) per unit energy, of
(7.9±0.4) PE/keV at zero drift ﬁeld, while a value of (7.0±0.3) PE/keV has been measured with
the drift ﬁeld settled at 200 V/cm [14]. A slightly improved LY of (8.1±0.2) PE/keV was found
stable within 2% during the whole period of operations with the underground argon [17]. A very
low levels of electronegative impurities in liquid argon have been measured with the 83mKr internal
calibration, achieving an electron drift lifetime τe>5 ms during the AAr campaign and reaching an
extrapolated value of τe>11 ms (at 50 V/cm) with the use of UAr.

surrounded by the WCD [Left]; picture of the TPC with the PTFE chamber and the 3” R11065 PMTs [Right].

Rates, voltage supplies, currents of the LSV and WCD PMTs are routinely monitored and regis-
tered. The LSV PMTs SER have been evaluated by injecting light from a laser. The light yield
of the LSV was measured through the 14C content in the TMB and the 60Co coming from the
TPC cryostat stainless steel. By combining the ﬁt results of the two spectra a LSV light yield of
(0.54±0.04) PE/keV was obtained.
A calibration campaign, following the ﬁrst dark matter search, was started with the aim to perform
a characterization of the detector response, a detection eﬃciency and an energy calibration for both
TPC and LSV. To this purpose, a dedicated calibration hardware was installed in the DS-50 detec-
tor, allowing for the placement of several gamma (57Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, 22Na) and neutron sources
(AmBe, AmC) in the LSV next to the TPC cryostat [18].
Data acquisition showed an impressive stability reaching a trigger eﬃciency of ∼90% during the
atmospheric argon campaign and up to 95% with the TPC ﬁlled with the UAr. A total amount of
more than 1000 live days data have been taken during the AAr and UAr physics runs.
Maintenance of the systems and facilities (cryogenic and gas systems, TPC and vetoes electronics,
slow control modules, etc.) related to the experiment have been occasionally performed to keep the
detectors in safe conditions and continuously running.

5 Results with atmospheric argon

A ﬁrst dark matter search has been performed with data collected with atmospheric argon target
with an AAr exposure of 47.1 live days (1422±67 kg×d exposure) of data acquired in the period
October 2013 - May 2014 [14]. The TPC trigger rate was dominated by 39Ar β-decays, giving a
value of 50 Hz. The 39Ar background from 47.1 live days of AAr corresponds to that expected in a
period ≥20 years of UAr DS-50 run at the upper limit 39Ar activity. A set of data quality cuts, both
for the LAr TPC and the vetoes, were applied. A ﬁducial mass of (36.9±0.6) kg was considered. It
was deﬁned by requiring the drift time to be between 40 µs and 334.5 µs, while no radial cuts were
applied. The WIMP search region was deﬁned in the range of 80÷460 PE of S1, corresponding
to recoils in the energy range 38÷206 keVnr. No events in the WIMP search region in the f90 vs
S1 plane resulted in the ﬁnal dark matter search as reported in Figure 2 [Right], leading to the
placement of the 90% CL exclusion curve with a minimum cross section of 6.1×10−44 cm2 for a
100 GeV/c2 WIMP mass.

6 First result with underground argon

After demonstrating the ﬁrst results with the atmospheric argon, the DS-50 TPC was emptied of
AAr in March 2015 and reﬁlled with the UAr; data taking started on April 1, 2015 and over 70.9 live
days (2616±43 kg×d) have been accumulated [17]. Data acquired with the UAr showed a trigger
rate of ∼1.5 Hz, signiﬁcantly reduced if compared with the AAr trigger rate of ∼50 Hz. After a
minimal set of cuts for single scatter events selection in the TPC was applied a good agreement
between the rate of events beyond the 39Ar endpoint for the AAr and UAr spectra was observed, as
reported in Figure 3 [Left], indicating an unchanged light yield after TPC chamber was ﬁlled with
the UAr. Further calibration with the 83mKr source conﬁrmed an improved light yield compared
to the AAr. A MC simulation of the DarkSide-50 detectors also developed to compare the ER
background from UAr with that from AAr was able to determine the 39Ar and 85Kr activities in the
UAr to be (0.73±0.11) mBq/kg and (2.05±0.13) mBq/kg, respectively. These results lead to a 39Ar

activity of the UAr corresponds to a reduction by a factor of (1.4±0.2)×103 compared to AAr. Then
a WIMP search region for the UAr has been deﬁned in the f90 vs S1 plane having an energy region
of interest of 20÷460 PE in S1 (13÷201 keVnr). No events resulted in the WIMP search region. The
null result of the UAr exposure gave an upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross
section of 3.1×10−44 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c2 and un upper limit of 2.0×10−44 cm2
for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c2 has been obtained combining the UAr results with the one of the
AAr exposure.

7 DarkSide-50 physics results

After a ﬁrst UAr campaign has been performed a new set of data consisting of 532.4 live days
(16660±270 kg×d) with the underground argon (from August 2, 2015, to October 4, 2017) has been
taken [15]. A blind analysis with the aim to design a set of criteria for the background rejection
without prior inspection of events in the ﬁnal search region has been carried out. An expected
background of 0.1 event as an acceptable level was chosen. Data were initially checked run-by-run
removing those runs aﬀected by hardware and software issues. Basic cuts for the event quality
selection and against cosmic ray activation have been applied, backgrounds from surface events,
radiogenic and cosmogenic neutrons have been rejected, electron recoil backgrounds mainly due to
scintillation and Cherenkov events in the TPC materials have been evaluated, ﬁducial cut accounted
for a ﬁducial mass of 31.3±0.5 kg, then the background surviving to the cuts was estimated. The
blind data selection was followed by an unblind analysis. No events were observed in the predeﬁned
DM search region and as reported in Figure 4 [Left] an upper limit on the spin-independent DM-
nucleon cross section at 1.14×1044 cm2 (3.78×1044 cm2, 3.43×1043 cm2) for 100 GeV/c2 (1 TeV/c2,
10 TeV/c2) DM particles was found.
A subset of of 532.4 live days data for a global amount of 6786.0 kg×d exposure was used for
an analysis based on the ionization signal with the purpose to explore the dark matter mass range
below 20 GeV/c2 [19, 20]. Some quality cuts were applied to the data before analysis. A dedicated
MC simulation reproducing the spatial distribution of S2 light was used to estimate the acceptance
of all the applied cuts and rejected events. The Ds-50 TPC was found fully eﬃcient at 0.1 keVee for

the ionization only signals. A 90% C.L. exclusion limit above 1.8 GeV/c2 for the spin-independent
cross section of dark matter WIMPs on nucleons, extending the exclusion region for dark matter
below previous limits in the range 1.8÷6 GeV/c2 was obtained. Results achieved with the ionization
S2 signal in DS-50 are reported in Figure 4 [Right].

8 Conclusions

The DarkSide-50 experiment is stably and continuously operating underground at LNGS since
October 2013. The ﬁrst dark matter search campaign of DS-50, with the TPC ﬁlled with the
atmospheric argon, set the most stringent limit on the WIMP-nucleon cross section for a liquid
argon target. The DarkSide-50 detector, with the TPC ﬁlled with UAr, is currently operating
and accumulating exposure in a stable, low-background conﬁguration. A depletion factor of 39Ar
activity in the UAr resulted in a reduction of the 39Ar concentration of ∼1400.
Results with an exposure of 532 days of UAr have been obtained leading to a sensitivity of
1.14×10−44 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c2. At the same time a very promising result based
on the ionization-only signal has been achieved for the low mass dark matter search exploring the
region above 1.8 GeV/c2.
DS-50 experiment with UAr technology demonstrated the feasibility of large scale LAr detectors
for direct dark matter search and based on the DS-50 experience LAr detectors for direct DM search
will be scaled to multi-hundred ton representing the most powerful background-free technique for
the ultimate experiment in dark matter search.
