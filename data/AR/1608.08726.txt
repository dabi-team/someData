Angular momentum projection is used to obtain eigen states of angular momentum from
general wave functions. Multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation with angular momen-
tum projection is an important microscopic method in nuclear physics. For accurate
multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation with angular momentum projection, concentrated

Introduction

Symmetry is important to investigate natures of systems. Hamiltonian has rotational sym-
metry, which is critical for isolated systems such as nuclei. Static states of nuclei are eigen
states of angular momentum. In order to study nuclear properties theoretically in details,
multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation of eigen states of angular momentum are performed
such as few-body calculations[1], Monte Carlo shell model (MCSM)[2], Hartree-Fock +
generator coordinate method (HF-GCM)[3], fermionic molecular dynamics (FMD)[4], and
antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD)[5]. The ﬁrst-principle calculations in which
all symmetries are taken into account are performed in only few-body systems in nuclear
physics. Simple wave functions such as Slater determinants are often used as basis wave
functions for many-body systems.

In MCSM, HF-GCM, FMD, and AMD, Slater determinants with angular momentum
projection are used as basis wave functions of multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation. A
Slater determinant is a simple and useful wave function to describe various deformation
but it can violate rotational and other symmetries. In order to restore rotational symmetry,
angular momentum projection is performed. By multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation with
angular momentum projection, detailed nuclear structure can be clariﬁed with taking into
account many-body correlations. In the calculation, basis wave functions that contain fewer
number of K-components are favored for accurate calculations, where K is a z component
of total angular momentum in the body-ﬁxed frame. It is because diﬀerent K-components

are superposed in the calculation, which is called K-mixing, and the diﬀerent K-components
are nonorthogonal in general. Mixing of nonorthogonal components can occur cancellation
of digits, which lose accuracy.

Distribution of K-components (K-distribution) strongly depends on orientation of wave
functions. Suppose an axially symmetric wave function. When the symmetric axis is set
to z-axis, the wave function is invariant for rotation around z-axis, which shows the wave
function contains only K = 0 components. On the other hand, when the symmetric axis is
set to other direction, the wave function is variant for rotation around z-axis and contains
many kinds of K-components although the wave function is symmetric. Wave functions with
diﬀerent orientations have diﬀerent K-distribution, but they give same energy after angular
momentum projection with K-mixing[6–8] in principle, but concentrated K-distribution is
better for accuracy of numerical calculation.

One choice to align wave functions is diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix. If a
wave functions is axially symmetric, the symmetric axis should be the long or short principal
axis of inertia for prolate or oblate shapes, respectively. This choice seems to work well for
deformed nuclei, but it is unclear whether it works well for exotic structures such as cluster
structures and triaxially deformed structures, and nuclei that are spherical but have ﬁnite
spin such as odd and odd-odd nuclei. A general method of alignment that can apply to
various nuclei is required.

In this paper, a method to align wave functions to concentrate K-distribution to fewer com-
ponents is proposed. By minimization of variance of ˆJz, which is z component of angular
momentum, wave functions are aligned and K-distribution is concentrated to fewer compo-
nents. It is shown that this method works well for spherical and deformed nuclei including
exotic deformation such as cluster structures and triaxially deformed structures.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, formalism of the method and model wave
functions are explained. Numerical results are shown in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, K-distribution
of wave functions aligned by the proposed method and a referenced method is compared.
Finally, conclusions are given in Sec. 5.

2. Formalism
2.1. Angular momentum projection
The angular momentum projection operator ˆP J
given as

M K onto |JM i state from |JKi state[9] is

ˆP J

M K =

2J + 1
8π2

DJ∗

M K (α, β, γ) ˆR(α, β, γ)dαdβdγ,

(1)

where J is total angular momentum, M and K are z-component of angular momentum
in laboratory and body-ﬁxed frames, respectively, α, β, and γ are Euler angles, and ˆR is
rotation operator deﬁned as

ˆR(α, β, γ) = e
where ˆJ is angular momentum operator. DJ

M K (β) is Wigner’s formula. The angular momentum projection operator is divided

and ˆP (z)
K is called K-projection operator. Using the angular momentum projection operator,
a resultant wave function |ΨJnM i of multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation for the nth J
state is given as

|ΨJnM i =

where |Φji is a Slater determinant for a basis wave function of the multi-conﬁguration
mixing calculation, and f J
ij is a weight of the each basis wave function, which is determined
by diagonalization of Hamiltonian and norm matrices as

|ΨJnM i =

(8)

here EJn is an expectation value of energy of the |ΨJnM i state. As seen in right hand side
of Eq. (7), a K-projected wave function | ˆP (z)
Φji is treated as a basis wave function. If

Ki-component of |Φji is enough small as,

ˆP (z)

|Φji ∼ 0,

(9)

the wave function | ˆP (z)

Φji can be eliminated from the basis set.

Diﬀerent K-components of a wave function are nonorthogonal, which suppress accuracy
of diagonalization of Hamiltonian and norm matrices because of cancellation. More con-
centrated K-distribution is better for multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation. Orientation of
wave functions strongly depends on K-distribution. Eﬀective alignment of the original wave
function,

|Φii → |Φ

′
ii = ˆR |Φii ,

(10)

is required for accurate multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation after angular momentum
projection.

2.2. Alignment of wave functions
zz of ˆJz is proposed. V J
In this paper, a method of alignment by minimization of variance V J
zz
is a (z, z) component of variance matrix VJ of angular momentum, and a (σ, ρ) component
of the matrix VJ is deﬁned as

V J
σρ =

ˆJσ ˆJρ + ˆJρ ˆJσ
2

*

+

− h ˆJσi h ˆJρi ,

(11)

here σ and ρ are x, y, or z.

3/12

 
 
By alignment of the original wave function, Eq. (10), the variance matrix VJ is transformed

as

VJ → VJ′

= R(α, β, γ)VJ tR(α, β, γ),

(12)

where R(α, β, γ) is a rotation matrix for Euler angles, α, β, γ as

R(α, β, γ)

cos α cos β cos γ − sin α sin γ − cos α cos β sin γ − sin α cos γ cos α sin β
sin α sin β
sin α cos β cos γ + cos α sin γ − sin α cos β sin γ + cos α cos γ
cos β
sin β sin γ

− sin β cos γ

= 









.

(13)

Optimized Euler angles are obtained by diagonalization of the variance matrix VJ because
it is a real symmetric matrix.

For comparison, K-distribution of wave functions aligned by diagonalization of moment-
of-inertia matrix I is also calculated. The (σ, ρ) element Iσρ of the moment-of-inertia matrix
I is

Iσρ =

hˆriσ ˆriρi ,

i
X

(14)

where ˆriσ is a σ component of the coordinate operator for the ith particle. z-axis is set
to long (short) principle axis of inertia for the case of quadrupole deformation parameter
γ2 < 30◦ (γ2 > 30◦).

2.3. Model wave functions

Deformed-basis AMD wave functions[10] are used as model wave functions of benchmark
calculations. A deformed-basis AMD wave function |Ψi is deﬁned as

|Ψi = ˆA |ψ1, ψ2, · · · , ψAi ,

(15)

where ˆA is antisymmetrization operator, A is the mass number, and |ψii (i = 1, ..., A) is a
single-particle wave function. The single-particle wave function |ψii is deﬁned as

|ψii = |φi ⊗ σi ⊗ τii ,

where |φii, |σii, and |τii are spatial, spin, and isospin parts, respectively. The spatial part
|φii form a Gaussian wave packet, and M and Zi denote width and center of the wave packet,
respectively. The width matrix M is a real 3 × 3 symmetric matrix, which is common to all
nucleons, and Zi is a complex vector. |↑i and |↓i are up and down spin, respectively, and αi
and βi are complex parameters to denote spin direction. |pi and |ni are proton and neutron,
respectively. All parameters are determined by energy variational calculations.

3. Results
3.1. Deformation of wave functions for benchmark calculations
As benchmark calculations, K-distribution of α-24Mg cluster structure of 28Si, Hartree-Fock
(HF) states in 12,13C, 14,15,16N, 16,17O, 18,19,20F, and 20,21Ne, and triaxially superdeformed
(SD) state in 40Ar are calculated. Those wave functions are obtained by energy variational
calculations. For α-24Mg cluster structure of 28Si and triaxially SD state of 40Ar, constraint
potentials for intercluster distance[11] between α and 24Mg and quadrupole deformation
parameter β2, respectively, are added to energy. The Gogny D1S force is used as an eﬀective
interaction.

Table 1 shows quadrupole deformation parameter (β2, γ2) of wave functions used in bench-
mark calculations. HF states of 13C, 14,15,16N,16.17O have spherical shapes (β2 < 0.1). Other
HF states are axially symmetric deformed shapes (γ2 ≃ 0◦ or 60◦). The SD state in 40Ar
and α-24Mg cluster structures in 28Si form triaxially deformed shapes (γ2 = 11.2◦ and 42.8◦,
respectively).

3.2. K-distribution
Figure 1 shows K-distribution for α-24Mg cluster structure of 28Si. Wave functions are
aligned by minimization of variance of ˆJz and diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix.
The wave function aligned by minimizing variance of ˆJz contains even K-components dom-
inantly [Fig. 1(a)]. On the other hand, in the wave function aligned by diagonalization of
moment-of-inertia matrix, K-components are widely distributed over even and odd numbers
[Fig. 1(b)].

Figure 2 shows density distribution of α-24Mg cluster structure of 28Si. Density is integrated
over z-axis. Wave functions are aligned by minimization of variance of ˆJz [Fig. 2(a)] and

diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix [Fig. 2(b)]. The density distribution of Figs. 2(a)
and (b) are much diﬀerent. The density distribution in Fig. 2(a) is symmetric for π rotation
around z-axis. On the other hand, nucleons are separated into α (left) and 24Mg (right)
clusters in Fig. 2(b), and there is no symmetry for rotation around z-axis. The diﬀerences
are caused by choices of z-axis. 24Mg cluster is deformed, and its long axis is orthogonal
to the line that connects centers of mass of α and 24Mg clusters in the wave function, and
the lines that connect centers of mass of α and 24Mg clusters are parallel and orthogonal to
z-axes for Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. The symmetric density distribution for π rotation
around z-axis in Fig. 2(a) reﬂects even-K dominance in Fig. 1(a).

Figure 3 shows K-distribution for HF states of 12,13C aligned by minimization of variance
of ˆJz and diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix. Both methods for alignment give
similar results. 12C and 13C contain only K = 0 and 1
2 components, respectively, which
shows axially symmetric form of the wave functions around z-axis. The K-components of
12C and 13C reﬂect spin of their ground states that are J π = 0+ and 1

4. Discussions

By comparison of K-distribution of wave functions aligned by minimization of variance
of ˆJz and diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix, it is found that former one has
advantages to concentrate K-distribution to fewer components, which can improve accu-
racy of multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation after angular momentum projection. Typical
examples are α-24Mg cluster structure (Fig. 1) and the HF state of 17O [Fig. 5(b)]. K-
distribution of wave functions aligned by minimization of variance of ˆJz and diagonalization
of moment-of-inertia matrix are quite diﬀerent. Wave functions of α-24Mg and 17O aligned

bars show expectation values of K-projection operator for each K number of wave functions
alignment by minimization of variance of ˆJz and diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix,
respectively.

by minimization of variance of ˆJz contain only even-K and K = 5
2 components, respec-
tively. On the other hand, K-components of the wave functions aligned by diagonalization
of moment-of-inertia matrix are widely distributed. The number of contained K-components
aﬀects accuracy of multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation after angular momentum projec-
tion. When more than one K-components are contained in a basis wave function, K-mixing
is required in a multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation. The K-mixing can make ﬁnal results
worse because diﬀerent K-components are nonorthogonal, which can cause cancellation of
digits in diagonalization. In fact, the wave function of the 17O aligned by diagonalization of
moment-of-inertia matrix gives unphysical energy after angular momentum projection to a
J = 5
2 components, which contain large
2 and 3
2 components, are mixed. It is because that the K = 1
amounts of J = 5
2 components
are almost same states after angular momentum projection. The overlap of the K = 1
2 and
2 components is 0.9999 after angular momentum projection to J = 5
3
2 states. On the other
hand, the wave function aligned by minimization of variance of ˆJz contains only K = 5
2 com-
ponents, and K-mixing is unnecessary. Energy after angular momentum projection is safely
obtained.

As for α-24Ar, two alignment methods give diﬀerent K-distribution, and the alignment
by minimization of variance of ˆJz works better to concentrate K-distribution to fewer
components. α-24Mg cluster structures have multipole deformed structure, which form Yλ
deformation with λ ≥ 3. Moment-of-inertia is quantity for quadrupole deformation, and
it does not reﬂect multipole deformation although it aﬀects total angular momentum.
Alignment by diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix works poorer to concentrate
K-distribution to fewer components for multipole deformed structures. In fact, α-24Mg
(d = 4 fm) structure is in oblate side (γ2 = 42.8◦ > 30◦), and short axis is set to z-axis
by diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix. Then density distribution integrated over z-
axis has neck structure and no symmetry for rotation around the z-axis as shown in Fig. 2(b)
because the line that connects centers of mass of α and 24Mg clusters are on the long axis
of the cluster structure. The alignment by minimization of variance of ˆJz selects the long

axis as z-axis, and the aligned wave function is symmetric for π rotation around the z-axis
[Fig. 2(a)].

As for HF states of 15N, 16N, and 17O, two methods of alignment give diﬀerent K-
distribution. They are odd or odd-odd nuclei and spherical as quadrupole deformation
parameters β2 are less than 0.1. For spherical odd and odd-odd nuclei, K-distribution is
determined by direction of angular momentum of a proton and/or a neutron in the each
highest orbit. The direction of angular momentum of the highest proton and/or neutron
directly reﬂects variance of ˆJz, and by minimization of the variance of ˆJz, wave functions
are aligned to concentrate K-distribution to fewer components. On the other hand, diago-
nalization of moment-of-inertia matrix has no meaning for spherical nuclei, and the method
works poorly to concentrate K-distribution to fewer components. Odd and odd-odd nuclei
has ﬁnite angular momentum even if it is spherical, and by the diagonalization of moment-
of-inertia matrix the orientation of angular momentum are set randomly and K-distribution
can be distributed widely. In the case of spherical even-even nuclei such as a HF state of
16O, two methods give similar results because they have only K = 0 components.

When wave functions deform largely, two methods give similar results except for multipole
deformed structures such as cluster structures. It is because elements of moment-of-
inertia matrix denote orientation of quadrupole deformation, and by diagonalization of
moment-of-inertia matrix, wave functions are aligned to concentrate K-distribution to fewer
components.

The HF states of 16N and 18F contain only K = 3 and 5 components, respectively. The K
numbers are larger than spin of their ground states, which are J π = 2− and 1+ for 16N and
18F, respectively. It shows that components of their ground states are not contained in their
HF states. In low-lying states of 16N and 18F, J π = 3− (0.298 MeV) and 5+ (1.121 MeV)
states exist, respectively, and dominant components of those low-lying excited states are
obtained as the HF state in simple mean-ﬁeld calculation. In order to obtain dominant
components of J π = 2− and 1+ ground states in 16N and 18F, respectively, more complicated
calculation are necessary such as energy variational calculation with a constraint. The HF
states of 16N and 18F deform oblately in the current framework, and their prolate states can
be dominant components of their ground states.

5. Conclusions
Minimization of variance of ˆJz is proposed as a useful method to align wave functions for
angular momentum projection. Advantages of the proposed method are shown by benchmark
calculations using the AMD wave functions of α-24Mg structure of 28Si, triaxially SD states of
40Ar, and HF states of 12,13C, 14,15,16N, 16,17O, 18,19,20F, and 20,21Ne. Comparing with wave
functions aligned by diagonalization of moment-of-inertia matrix, K-distribution of wave
functions aligned by the proposed method is more concentrated, which has advantages for
accurate multi-conﬁguration mixing calculation with angular momentum projection. Espe-
cially, the proposed method works well for multipole deformed structures such as cluster
structures, and spherical structures of odd and odd-odd nuclei. For largely quadrupole
deformed structure of even-even nuclei, two methods give similar results.
