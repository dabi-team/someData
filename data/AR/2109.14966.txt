Abstract

We propose an extension of the N-mixture model that enables the estimation of abundances

of multiple species as well as the correlations between them. Our novel multi-species N-

Mixture model (MNM) is the ﬁrst to address the estimation of both positive and negative

inter-species correlations, which allows us to assess the inﬂuence of the abundance of one

species on another. We provide extensions that permit the analysis of data with excess of zero

counts, and relax the assumption that populations are closed through the incorporation of an

autoregressive term in the abundance. Our approach provides a method of quantifying the

strength of association between species’ population sizes and is of practical use to population

and conservation ecologists. We evaluate the performance of the proposed models through

simulation experiments in order to examine the accuracy of both model estimates and coverage

rates. The results show that the MNM models produce accurate estimates of abundance, inter-

species correlations and detection probabilities at a range of sample sizes. The MNM models

are applied to avian point data collected as part of the North American Breeding Bird Survey

(NABBS) between 2010 and 2019. The results reveal an increase in Bald Eagle abundance in

south-eastern Alaska in the decade examined.

Introduction

Abundance in animal communities is of great interest in ecology, particularly in the areas of

conservation and wildlife management (Witmer, 2005; Nichols and MacKenzie, 2004). Count

data is an attractive option for estimating abundance due to the relative aﬀordability with which

it may be collected and the reduced risk of harm to both animals and humans when compared

to more direct data collection methods (Verdade et al., 2013). However, count data for animal

abundance has a tendency to suﬀer from imperfect detection (i.e., the recorded information is

usually imperfect in the sense that it does not represent the total abundance). Furthermore,

when the detection probability is small, there is a tendency towards the underestimation of

abundance. Due to the characteristics of these data, traditional modelling techniques, such

as generalised linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989), cannot be applied directly to the

data, as they do not accommodate imperfect detection.

N-mixture models (Royle, 2004) constitute a class of models which may be used to estimate

abundance from count data. These models assume that the population under analysis is

closed, i.e., it is constant in terms of births, deaths, and migration. The counts at each site

and time are considered independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables that

follow a Binomial distribution.

In the original N-mixture model, the detection probability

is estimated using the data, without the speciﬁcation of any prior distribution with ﬁxed

parameters. The population size at each site is treated as a random eﬀect, with an assumed

probability distribution. The distributions that are typically considered for the population size

at each site are the Poisson and Negative Binomial, although any other non-negative discrete

distribution could also be considered.

The ability to estimate correlations between species abundances allows us to relax any

assumption of independent species abundances. This is the aim of the multi-species N-mixture

(MNM) models presented in this paper – a new class of models which estimate abundance

for multiple species simultaneously while accounting for imperfect detection, and estimate

2

inter-species correlations, which are intended to allow for inferences about the relationships

between diﬀerent species.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.

In Section 3, we introduce our

novel modelling framework to estimate abundance and inter-species correlations in animal

communities based on spatio-temporal count data. We also describe the model formulation,

estimation procedure, and the computation of the inter-species correlations. In Section 4, we

present the data obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS) (Pardieck

et al., 2020), which will be used to illustrate our modelling approach. Later, in Section 5, we

compare results of model ﬁt on the NABBS data to obtain the best ﬁt. Finally, in Section 6, we

present a general discussion.

2 Related Works

Several multi-species modelling frameworks have been developed previously which allow for

the analysis of occurrence-data (Dorazio and Royle, 2005; Yamaura et al., 2011) or count-data

(Yamaura et al., 2012; Golding et al., 2017; Gomez et al., 2017) of multiple species.

Dorazio and Royle (2005) developed a model for estimating the size of a biological com-

munity by modelling the probability of detection as a Binomial random variable, and the

probability of occurrence as a Bernoulli random variable. They allow rates of detection and

occurrence to vary among species, and not every species is assumed to be present at every

location. However, the aim of their model is to determine the number of species, not the

number of individuals of each species, as is the aim of N-mixture models.

Yamaura et al. (2011) developed a multi-species model that estimates the animal abundance

from occurrence-data. This is an extension of the single-species model developed by Royle and

Nichols (2003), in which binary detection/non-detection data is linked to abundance. Yamaura

et al. (2012) extended this model to count data. The assumption behind these models is that the

abundances or detection probabilities of species in the community might be linked by species-

level or functional group-level characteristics. However, inter-species abundance correlations

are not explored within these models.

Gomez et al. (2017) developed a multi-species N-mixture model whose aim was to allow

3

for the estimation of abundance of rare species by borrowing strength from other species in

the community. This was done by assuming detection probabilities are drawn at random from

a Beta distribution. Another multi-species N-mixture model was developed by Golding et al.

(2017), which used the dependent double-observer method to create a multi-species dependent

double-observer abundance model. This allowed them to address an issue of false-positive

errors in detection. The focus of both Gomez et al. (2017) and Golding et al. (2017) was an

improvement in detection probability. None of the preceding multi-species models allow us to

make inferences as to the relationships within an ecological community, as we propose to do

with our multi-species N-mixture model.

Moral et al. (2018) developed an extension to the single-species N-mixture model which

allowed for the estimation of abundances of two species, and the correlations between these

abundances. However, this model only examines two species, and is therefore not as complete

as the model we propose here, which allows us to examine whole communities.

Dorazio and Connor (2014) developed a multi-species N-mixture model which allowed

for abundances of species with similar traits to be correlated. However, to guarantee positive

deﬁnite correlations, they only allow for positive correlations through the use of a distance

metric 𝑑 coupled with a spatial autocorrelation structure of the type 𝑒− 𝑑

𝜙 . The framework

we present here is more complete in that we guarantee positive deﬁniteness of the correlation

matrix via an elegant prior setup. We also explore ways of incorporating zero-inﬂation and

open population dynamics, which is not something attempted by Dorazio and Connor (2014).

Finally, Niku et al. (2019) describe generalised linear latent variable models - a modelling

technique which allows for obtaining correlation matrices in an elegant manner. However, these

models do not allow for the incorporation of imperfect detection.

3 Methods

The models developed in the following Section are a multi-species extension to the original

N-mixture model of Royle (2004), which allows for accurate estimation of both the latent abun-

dances and inter-species correlations, while accounting for imperfect detection and relaxing

the closure assumption.

3.1 Multi-Species N-Mixture Model (MNM Model)

Consider a study which sees count data 𝑌𝑖𝑡 𝑠 collected, where 𝑌𝑖𝑡 𝑠 is the number of individuals

observed for 𝑆 diﬀerent species (𝑠 = 1, . . . , 𝑆) from 𝑅 sites (𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑅). Consider also that

these samples are taken from each site on 𝑇 occasions (𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑇). The true abundance at

site 𝑖 for species 𝑠 is given by 𝑁𝑖𝑠. We observe 𝑁𝑖𝑠 with detection probability 𝑝𝑖𝑡 𝑠, and it is

assumed that species populations are closed with respect to births, deaths and migration (i.e.,

that the population sizes do not change due to any of these factors, akin to the N-mixture model

proposed by Royle (2004)). Our model assumes that 𝑁𝑖𝑠 follows a Poisson distribution, and

may be written as:

𝑌𝑖𝑡 𝑠 | 𝑁𝑖𝑠, 𝑝𝑖𝑡 𝑠 ∼ Binomial(𝑁𝑖𝑠, 𝑝𝑖𝑡 𝑠),

𝑁𝑖𝑠 | 𝜆𝑖𝑠 ∼ Poisson(𝜆𝑖𝑠),

logit(𝑝𝑖𝑡 𝑠) = z(cid:62)

𝑖𝑡 b𝑠,

log(𝜆𝑖𝑠) = 𝑎𝑖𝑠 + x(cid:62)

𝑖 𝜷𝑠,

a𝑖 | 𝝁𝑎, 𝚺𝑎 ∼ MVN( 𝝁𝑎, 𝚺𝑎),

where a𝑖 = (𝑎𝑖1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖𝑆)(cid:62). The Poisson rate parameter 𝜆𝑖𝑠 represents the mean abundance

at site 𝑖, and a𝑖 is an 𝑆-dimensional vector that contains the random eﬀects 𝑎𝑖𝑠 that allow us

to estimate inter-species correlations.

In the above model, covariates may be incorporated

in the detection probability and the abundance, with z(cid:62)

𝑖𝑡 the 𝑖𝑡-th row of the design matrix Z
of dimension 𝑅𝑇 × 𝑞 𝑝, 𝑏𝑠 the 𝑞 𝑝 × 1 parameter vector for the probability of detection, x(cid:62)
𝑖

the 𝑖-th row of the design matrix X of dimension 𝑅 × 𝑞𝜆, and 𝜷 the 𝑞𝜆 × 1 parameter vector

for the abundance. Here, 𝑞 𝑝 and 𝑞𝜆 represent the number of covariates associated with the

detection probability and the abundance, respectively. Note that diﬀerent covariate eﬀects may

be estimated per species, and other species-level random eﬀects may also be included.

3.2 Hurdle-Poisson Model (MNM-Hurdle Model)

In this Section, we develop a further extension of the multi-species N-mixture model, appro-

priate for scenarios in which the number of zero-counts exceed those expected under a Poisson

distribution. We now allow the counts to follow a Hurdle-Poisson distribution, with 𝜆𝑖𝑠 deﬁned

5

as in the MNM Model, and 𝜃 the probability of obtaining a zero-count.

The Hurdle-Poisson distribution consists of two separate processes. The ﬁrst is a Bernoulli

process, which determines whether a site is occupied (count is non-zero) or unoccupied (count

is zero).

If the count is non-zero, a second random variable with a zero-truncated Poisson

distribution determines the value of the count, i.e.,

Occupancy𝑖𝑠 ∼ Bernoulli(1 − 𝜃),

Count𝑖𝑠 ∼ Zero Truncated Poisson(𝜆𝑖𝑠).

We then deﬁne the latent abundances 𝑁𝑖𝑠 as

which yields

𝑁𝑖𝑠 =





0

if Occupancy𝑖𝑠 = 0

,

Count𝑖𝑠

if Occupancy𝑖𝑠 = 1

𝑁𝑖𝑠 ∼ Hurdle-Poisson(𝜆𝑖𝑠, 𝜃).

If the Bernoulli process is equal to 0, then the site is unoccupied and 𝑁𝑖𝑠 is equal to 0.

However, if the Bernoulli process is equal to 1, then the hurdle is crossed, and the value of 𝑁𝑖𝑠

is determined by the zero-truncated Poisson process. Similar to the MNM model, populations

are assumed to be closed.

We assume a single probability of obtaining a zero count 𝜃. However, 𝜃 may also be allowed

to vary by site and/or species, and may depend on covariates through a logit link. All other

parameters are distributed as described in the MNM model in Section 3.1.

3.3 Autoregressive Model (MNM-AR Model)

In order to model populations over multiple years, a further extension to the multi-species

N-mixture model is proposed, which allows us to relax the assumption that species populations

are closed with respect to births, deaths and migration. We do this through the inclusion of an

autoregressive term in the abundance parameter.

The study design now consists of data collected over 𝐾 years (𝑘 = 1, . . . , 𝐾) for 𝑆 species

at 𝑅 locations, each with 𝑇 sampling occasions. The observed abundance (𝑌 ) and actual

6

abundance (𝑁) are now allowed to vary by year:

𝑌𝑖𝑡 𝑘𝑠 ∼ Binomial(𝑁𝑖𝑘𝑠, 𝑝𝑠),

𝑁𝑖𝑘𝑠 ∼ Poisson(𝜆𝑖𝑘𝑠).

If 𝑘 = 1, then 𝜆𝑖1𝑠 is deﬁned as before:

log(𝜆𝑖1𝑠) = 𝑎𝑖𝑠 + x(cid:62)

𝑖 𝜷𝑠.

However, for 𝑘 > 1, we allow 𝜆𝑖𝑘𝑠 to depend on the latent abundance at year 𝑘 − 1:

log(𝜆𝑖𝑘𝑠) = 𝑎𝑖𝑠 + x(cid:62)

𝑖 𝜷𝑠 + 𝜙𝑠log(𝑁𝑖 (𝑘−1)𝑠 + 1).

The term log(𝑁𝑖 (𝑘−1)𝑠 + 1) is used here rather than the simpler 𝑁𝑖 (𝑘−1)𝑠 to avoid the rapid

increase in sampled 𝜆 values when 𝑁 values are large (Fokianos and Tjøstheim, 2011).

3.4 Hurdle-Autoregressive Model (MNM-Hurdle-AR Model)

A straightforward combination of the MNM-Hurdle model and the MNM-AR model produces

the MNM-Hurdle-AR model. This model accommodates excess zeros while also accounting for

an autoregressive structure in the data. The zero-inﬂation is introduced as in the MNM-Hurdle

model, i.e.,

where

𝑌𝑖𝑡 𝑘𝑠 ∼ Binomial(𝑁𝑖𝑘𝑠, 𝑝𝑠),

𝑁𝑖𝑘𝑠 ∼ Hurdle-Poisson(𝜆𝑖𝑘𝑠, 𝜃),

log(𝜆𝑖𝑘𝑠) =





𝑎𝑖𝑠 + x(cid:62)

𝑖 𝜷𝑠,

for 𝑘 = 1

.

𝑎𝑖𝑠 + x(cid:62)

𝑖 𝜷𝑠 + 𝜙𝑠log(𝑁𝑖 (𝑘−1)𝑠 + 1),

for 𝑘 > 1

3.5 Model Estimation

The models described in this paper are implemented using a Bayesian framework. Each of

the above models were implemented in R (R Core Team, 2020a) through the probabilistic

programming software JAGS (Plummer et al., 2003; Plummer, 2017) using four chains with

50,000 iterations each, of which the ﬁrst 10,000 were discarded as burn-in, and a thinning of

7

ﬁve to reduce autocorrelation in the MCMC samples. Parameter convergence was determined

using the potential scale reduction factor ( ˆ𝑅), a diagnostic criteria proposed by Gelman and

Rubin (1992). An ˆ𝑅 value that is very close to one is an indication that the four chains have

mixed well. If ˆ𝑅 value was less than 1.05, the chains were considered to have mixed properly,

and the posterior estimates of the parameters were considered reliable.

Prior distributions were assigned as follows: 𝝁𝑎, the vector of means of the random eﬀect

a, was assigned a multivariate Normal prior with a diagonal variance-covariance matrix 𝚺0 and

mean vector 𝝁0
with a diagonal scale matrix 𝛀, and 𝑆 + 1 degrees of freedom 𝑣 which results in a Uniform(-1,1)

. 𝚺𝑎, the variance-covariance matrix of a was assigned an inverse-Wishart prior

prior on the correlations (Plummer, 2017):

𝝁𝑎 ∼ Normal𝑠 ( 𝝁0

, 𝚺0),

𝚺𝑎 ∼ Inverse-Wishart(𝛀, 𝑣).

An inverse-Wishart distribution is speciﬁed as the prior for the covariance matrix of the

random eﬀect a. Criticisms of the inverse-Wishart prior include the dependency imposed

between correlations and variances, and the fact that there is a single degree of freedom

parameter which determines the uncertainty for all variance parameters. It is demonstrated by

Alvarez et al. (2014) that when the variance is small relative to the mean, the correlation is

biased towards zero, and the variance is biased towards larger values, though when working

with count data, typically variances are large relative to the mean. Despite these issues, the

inverse-Wishart distribution is a prior distribution commonly assigned to a covariance matrix

in Bayesian analysis due to its conjugacy with the Normal distribution, and for these models

the inverse-Wishart distribution provides a good solution due to its guarantee of providing a

positive deﬁnite covariance matrix.

In the Hurdle and Hurdle-AR models, 𝜃 is assigned a Beta prior with the value of both

shape parameters equal to one, which is equivalent to a vague uniform prior:

𝜃 ∼ Beta(1, 1).

In the AR and Hurdle-AR models, 𝜙 is assigned a Multivariate Normal prior, with hyperpriors

8

𝝁𝝓 and diagonal matrix 𝚺𝝓:

𝝓𝒔 ∼ MVN( 𝝁𝝓, 𝚺𝝓),

Extensive simulation studies were carried out to examine the accuracy of parameter esti-

mates; see Appendix B for more details.

3.6

Inter-Species Correlations

The presence of the multivariate normal random eﬀect a in the abundance provides a link

between species’ abundances. The correlation matrix for the random eﬀect, 𝚺𝑎, may be

estimated directly from the Bayesian model. In this sense, the inter-species correlations for the

latent abundances 𝑁𝑠 and 𝑁𝑠(cid:48), for all 𝑠 ≠ 𝑠(cid:48), are calculated for each model as:

𝜌(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48)) =

Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48))
√︁(Var(𝑁𝑠))(Var(𝑁𝑠(cid:48)))

.

The derivation of Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48)) can be found in Appendix A.

The inter-species correlations for the MNM model and Hurdle model are assumed not

to vary by year, so these models have a single analytic correlation matrix. However, in the

AR and Hurdle-AR model, we assume latent abundances change by year, which requires the

computation of 𝐾 analytic correlation matrices. Note that the MNM and AR models required

the use of properties of conditional variance and covariance to determine analytic correlations.

In the Hurdle and Hurdle-AR models, the properties of conditional variance and covariance

were merged with second-order Taylor approximations to make their computation feasible.

4 Case Study: North American Breeding Bird Survey

In this section, we describe the application of the multi-species N-mixture models to a real

world case study, to examine bird populations using data collected as part of the North American

Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS).

The North American Breeding Bird Survey (Pardieck et al., 2020) was ﬁrst conducted in

1966, and now provides data annually on more than 400 bird species across 3700 routes in

the United States and Canada. Each of these routes is approximately 24.5 miles long and is

9

Fig. 1: Location of sites in Alaska marked in red, with the Alexander Archipelago - the location of

the Alaskan Bald Eagle population - outlined in black.

composed of 50 stops, approximately 0.5 miles apart. At each stop, every bird seen or heard

within a 0.25-mile radius is recorded. For the sake of our models, each of these routes is

considered a site, and each of the 50 stops along a route is a sampling occasion.

We examine data collected in Alaska in the 10-year period 2010-2019. There are 94 routes

in Alaska (Fig. 1) at which data was collected during this time, and each of these routes are

composed of 50 sampling locations, totalling 4,700 observations per bird species.

Bald Eagle populations in Alaska are estimated at between 8,000 and 30,000 birds, ac-

counting for roughly half of the global population (Hodges, 2011; Hansen, 1987; King et al.,

1972). For this reason, Bald Eagles were chosen as a species of interest. Several other species

were chosen; these included waterbirds such as geese, swans and snipes which were chosen for

their relationships with Bald Eagles, as Bald Eagles are known to prey on waterbirds such as

ducks, geese and grebes when ﬁsh are in short supply (Dunstan and Harper, 1975; Todd et al.,

1982; McEwan and Hirth, 1980). Additionally, a selection of species with inland habitats, such

as thrushes and swallows, were examined. In total, 10 species were selected for analysis, of the

233 total species present in Alaska within the 10-year period. The full list of species selected

and the frequency with which they were observed is given in Table 1.

The models described in Section 3 were ﬁtted to the NABBS data. Each was ﬁtted three

times, varying the dimension of the detection probability. Initially, detection probability was

allowed to vary by site, species and year. Subsequently, models were ﬁtted in which detection

probability varies only by site and species, and then by species alone.

Initially, the models were ﬁtted without covariates, and results were compared using their

Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Delattre et al., 2014) values. Subsequently, latitude,

longitude and their interaction term latitude × longitude were included in the linear predictors for

the abundance parameters, and models were again compared using BIC values. All covariates

were scaled to have zero-mean and unit variance.

Initial examination of this data revealed that 93.2% of observations (438, 040 of a total of

470, 000 observations) consisted of zero counts. This suggested that a model with a hurdle

component might provide an appropriate framework for this data. Furthermore, this data was

11

collected over the course of a decade. For this reason, we might expect that an autoregressive

term may be useful to incorporate the time dependence.

Each model was ﬁtted using four chains with 50,000 iterations each, of which the ﬁrst

10,000 were discarded as burn-in, using a thinning value of ﬁve. All prior distributions were

assigned as described in Section 3.5.

5 Results

Initially, the models were ﬁtted without covariates and were compared using BIC values. The

result of this comparison was that the Hurdle-AR model, in which detection probability varies

by species (Hurdle-AR(C)), provided the best ﬁt for the NABBS data. However, the addition of a

response surface for latitude and longitude in the linear predictors for the abundance parameters

results in the Hurdle model in which detection probability varies by species (Hurdle(C))

producing the lowest BIC value. This suggests that, within the range of models produced, this

model provides the best ﬁt for our data. The variance which was initially explained by the

addition of the autoregressive term is now explained by the latitude and longitude covariates,

which render the autoregressive component unnecessary. The result of this comparison is given

in Table 2.

The latent inter-species correlations are given in Fig. 2, while the derivation of analytic

correlations, which vary by site and year, are given in Appendix A. The latent correlations are

obtained after probability of detection and other covariates are taken into account. They may

be interpreted as an interaction strength metric, which allows for the study of the inﬂuence of

one species’ abundance on the others (Berlow et al., 2004; Moral et al., 2018).

6 Discussion

We have proposed a multi-species extension to the N-mixture model which allows for the

estimation of inter-species abundance correlations through the addition of a random variable in

the abundance. Results of simulation studies (see Appendix B) reveal that this model performs

well under a range of scenarios, with abundances and detection probabilities that range from

low to high. For this reason, we believe that this approach represents an attractive framework

for examining multi-species abundances.

13

Fig. 2: Estimated latent inter-species correlation matrix, produced by the Hurdle(C) model ﬁtted

to the NABBS data including covariates in the linear predictor for the abundance parameter.

Issues with parameter convergence were encountered when ﬁtting the Hurdle and Hurdle-

AR models. When zero-inﬂation and abundance are large, and detection probability is small,

issues with convergence occurred in up to 20% of parameters. While this convergence issue

does not appear to negatively aﬀect the relative biases of parameter estimates (as can be seen

in Appendix B, Table 3 and Table 4), coverage probability for detection probability 𝑝 and

random eﬀect mean 𝜇𝑎 is negatively impacted (Appendix D). In the same models, we see larger

coverage for 𝑁. This is to be expected, and is due to zero counts being perfectly predicted.

Previous works have demonstrated that N-mixture models can sometimes suﬀer from issues

with identiﬁability (Dennis et al., 2015) wherein probability of detection estimates are very close

to zero and abundance estimates are inﬁnite. To address this issue, we have performed extensive

simulation studies, detailed in Appendix B, in which we assess the estimates of abundance and

detection probability for a large range of sample sizes, detection probabilities, abundance sizes,

and in the case of the Hurdle and Hurdle-AR models, zero-count probabilities. The result was

a simulation study which demonstrated no evidence that this modelling framework suﬀers from

these identiﬁability issues.

The models presented here all use the Poisson distribution to model the latent abundances.

However, any other count distribution might instead be used, for example, the Negative Bino-

14

mial. Our calculations for the analytic correlations, however, reﬂect only the use of the Poisson

distribution.

Case study results reveal that the diﬀerence in BIC values between the model with the

lowest BIC value (Hurdle(B) with covariates) and the model with the second-lowest BIC value

(Hurdle-AR(B) without covariates) is 223. This sizeable diﬀerence in BIC values suggests that

the Hurdle(B) model with covariates provides a better ﬁt than the Hurdle-AR(B) model without

covariates.

Case study detection probability values range from 0.047 (Tree Swallow) to 0.564 (Swain-

son’s Thrush). Estimates of the maximum latent abundance 𝑁 per species are provided in

Appendix C, which reveals that while N-mixture models occasionally suﬀer from identiﬁabil-

ity issues as described above, this does not appear to be an issue for this case study.

The estimates for Bald Eagle abundance produced by this model are plotted by site and

year in Fig. 3. Of the 94 possible sites in Alaska, the Bald Eagle population is concentrated

at 18 sites at the southeastern coast, along a 300-mile stretch of islands called the Alexander

Archipelago. Examination of this ﬁgure suggested a possible increase in Bald Eagle abundance

in this area between 2010 and 2019. The mean abundance was calculated per year (Fig. 4), and

a one-sided Mann-Kendall test (Mann, 1945; Kendall, 1948) for an increasing trend in time

series data was performed. The result of this was a Kendall’s 𝜏 value of 0.6 and a p-value of

0.0082, indicating that it was appropriate to reject the null hypothesis that no increasing trend

exists. We can therefore conclude that Bald Eagle abundances increased in the area of the

Alexander Archipelago in the decade between 2010 and 2019.

In the models that contain an autoregressive component, we obtain separate Corr(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48))

per year. As a feature of model formulation, the correlation between two species do not change

sign from year to year. We can accommodate a change in sign by allowing for an unstructured

covariance matrix of the autocorrelation coeﬃcient 𝚺𝝓, and this particular extension is subject

of ongoing work. Furthermore, the models presented in this paper assume that sites are

independent of one another. A further extension we are currently working on is the incorporation

of spatial dependence.

A Analytic Correlations

In this section, we present the analytical expressions for the correlation between the latent

abundances (𝑁𝑠 and 𝑁𝑠(cid:48)) for all 𝑠 ≠ 𝑠(cid:48) for the MNM model. For convenience of notation, we

drop the dependence on 𝑖 and 𝑡, 𝑌𝑠 = ({𝑌𝑖𝑡 𝑠}), 𝑁𝑠 = ({𝑁𝑖𝑠}), 𝑝𝑠 = ({𝑝𝑖𝑡 𝑠}), 𝜆𝑠 = ({𝜆𝑖𝑠}). We

need the expectation, variance and covariance of the log-normally distributed 𝜆𝑠, which are

given by

E(𝜆𝑠) = 𝑒 𝜇𝑠+ 1

2 Σ𝑠𝑠 ,

Var(𝜆𝑠) = 𝑒 𝜇𝑠+𝜇𝑠+ 1

2 (Σ𝑠𝑠+Σ𝑠𝑠) (𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠 − 1)𝑒2𝜇𝑠+Σ𝑠𝑠 (𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠 − 1),

Cov(𝜆𝑠, 𝜆𝑠(cid:48)) = 𝑒 𝜇𝑠+𝜇𝑠(cid:48) + 1

2 (Σ𝑠𝑠+Σ𝑠(cid:48)𝑠(cid:48) ) (𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠(cid:48) − 1).

where 𝜇 = 𝝁𝒂 + x𝑖 𝝁𝜷 and Σ = Σ𝑎 + x2

𝑖 𝚺𝜷. As 𝑁𝑠 ∼ Poisson(𝜆𝑠) and 𝑌𝑠 ∼ Binomial(𝑁𝑠, 𝑝𝑠),

we can write the conditional expectation and variance directly:

E(𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠) = Var(𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠) = 𝜆𝑠,

Var(𝑌𝑠 | 𝑁𝑠) = 𝑁𝑠 𝑝𝑠 (1 − 𝑝𝑠).

The unconditional expectation and variance of 𝑁𝑠, and the unconditional covariance between

𝑁𝑠 and 𝑁𝑠(cid:48), can be derived using the laws of total expectation, variance and covariance as

follows:

E(𝑁𝑠) = E𝜆𝑠 (E𝑁𝑠 (𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠)) = E𝜆𝑠 (𝜆𝑠) = 𝑒 𝜇𝑠+ 1

2 Σ𝑠𝑠 .

Var(𝑁𝑠) = E𝜆𝑠 (Var𝑁𝑠 (𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠)) + Var𝜆𝑠 (E𝑁𝑠 (𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠))

= E𝜆𝑠 (𝜆𝑠)Var𝜆𝑠 (𝜆𝑠) = 𝑒 𝜇𝑠+ 1

2 Σ𝑠𝑠 + 𝑒2𝜇𝑠+Σ𝑠𝑠 (𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠 − 1).

Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48)) = E𝜆𝑠𝜆𝑠(cid:48) (Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48) | 𝜆𝑠, 𝜆𝑠(cid:48)) + Cov𝜆𝑠𝜆𝑠(cid:48) (E𝑁 𝑠 (𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠), E𝑁𝑠(cid:48) (𝑁𝑠(cid:48) | 𝜆𝑠(cid:48))).

We assume that, given the correlated eﬀects a, the latent and observed abundances are inde-

pendent, which means that Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48) | 𝜆𝑠, 𝜆𝑠(cid:48)) = 0. So,

Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48)) = Cov𝜆𝑠𝜆𝑠(cid:48) (E𝑁 𝑠 (𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠), E𝑁𝑠(cid:48) (𝑁𝑠(cid:48) | 𝜆𝑠(cid:48))),

= Cov(𝜆𝑠, 𝜆𝑠(cid:48)) = 𝑒 𝜇𝑠+𝜇𝑠(cid:48) + 1

2 (Σ𝑠𝑠+Σ𝑠(cid:48)𝑠(cid:48) ) (𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠(cid:48) − 1),

= (𝑒 𝜇𝑠+ 1

2 Σ𝑠𝑠 )(𝑒 𝜇𝑠(cid:48) + 1

2 Σ𝑠(cid:48)𝑠(cid:48) )(𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠(cid:48) − 1) = E(𝑁𝑠)E(𝑁𝑠(cid:48))(𝑒Σ𝑠𝑠(cid:48) − 1).

22

The correlations between 𝑁𝑠 and 𝑁𝑠(cid:48) can be estimated in a similar way for the other models

presented in this paper. The models with a hurdle component require the use of Hurdle-Poisson

E(𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠) and Var(𝑁𝑠 | 𝜆𝑠), which results in the need for an approximation of E(𝑁𝑠) and

Var(𝑁𝑠) and Cov(𝑁𝑠, 𝑁𝑠(cid:48)) based on quadratic Taylor expansions. Correlations for models with

an autoregressive component follow the same form as the MNM model, with the following

substitution for 𝜆

𝜆𝑠 ∼ MVLN(𝑒 𝜇𝑖+ 1

2 Σ𝑖𝑖 , (𝑒 𝜇𝑖+𝜇 𝑗 + 1

2 (Σ𝑖𝑖+Σ 𝑗 𝑗 ) )(𝑒Σ𝑖 𝑗 − 1)),

where 𝜇 = 𝜇𝑎 + x𝑖 𝜇𝛽 + log(𝑁𝑖,𝑘−1,𝑠 + 1)𝜇 𝜙 and Σ = Σ𝑎 + x2

𝑖 Σ𝛽 + log(𝑁𝑖,𝑘−1,𝑠 + 1)2Σ𝜙.

B Simulation Study

In this section, we describe the simulation studies which were used to determine the accuracy

of the estimates produced by the multi-species N-mixture models.

To determine if our modelling framework produces accurate estimates at contrasting sample

sizes, a series of simulations were run in which we varied the number of sites, 𝑅 ∈ {10, 100}, the

number of sampling occasions, 𝑇 ∈ {5, 10}, and the number of species observed, 𝑆 ∈ {5, 10}.

Within these simulations, we varied the detection probability 𝑝, and the mean number of

individuals per site 𝜆. Small values for 𝑝 lay between 0.1 and 0.4, while large values for 𝑝 lay

between 0.5 and 0.9. Small values for 𝜆 had a median value of 7 and standard deviation of 10,

while large values for 𝜆 had a median value of 55 and standard deviation of 74.

In the case of the Hurdle and Hurdle-AR models, we also varied the probability of a

zero-count occurring, 𝜃 ∈ {0.2, 0.7}. For each combination of parameters, we simulated 100

datasets and estimated 𝑁, 𝚺𝑎, and 𝑝. We also estimated values for 𝜃 and 𝜙, in the case of

the Hurdle and AR models, respectively. Relative mean bias was calculated for the estimated

probability of obtaining a zero count ˆ𝜃, autocorrelation coeﬃcient ˆ𝜙, probability of detection

𝑝, and mean of the abundance random eﬀects 𝝁𝑎. The smaller the value for relative bias,

the closer to the true value our estimated parameters were. We compared ˆ𝑁 to 𝑁 using the

concordance correlation coeﬃcient (Lin, 1989), which is given by the formula:

𝜌𝑐 =

2𝜌ˆ𝜎𝜎
ˆ𝜎2 + 𝜎2 + ( ˆ𝜇 − 𝜇)2

,

23

where 𝜌 is Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient, 𝜎 and 𝜇 are the standard deviation and mean of

the true values of 𝑁, and ˆ𝜎 and ˆ𝜇 are the standard deviation and mean of the estimated values

of 𝑁. The Pearson correlation coeﬃcient is a measure of the strength of a linear association

between two variables. However, the Pearson correlation is invariant under changes in location

and scale. If two variables exhibit a linear relationship, but are very diﬀerent in terms of their

location or scale, the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient will not reveal this. The concordance

correlation coeﬃcient, however, does take into account diﬀerences in location and scale. For

this reason, the concordance correlation coeﬃcient was chosen as a measure of the linear

relationship between the true abundance and estimated abundance, rather than the Pearson

correlation coeﬃcient. The higher the value of the concordance correlation coeﬃcient, the

closer our estimates for 𝑁 were to the true values.

We compared our estimated correlation matrix to the true value using the correlation matrix

distance (Herdin et al., 2005), which is given by the following formula:

CMD(X1, X2) = 1 −

tr(X1X2)
(cid:107)X1(cid:107) 𝑓 (cid:107)X2(cid:107) 𝑓

,

where X1 and X2 are two correlation matrices, tr(X1X2) is the trace of the product of these

two matrices, and (cid:107).(cid:107) 𝑓 denotes the Frobenius norm.

Additionally, the coverage probabilities for each parameter were determined as the pro-

portion of simulations in which the 50% credible interval contained the true parameter value.

We expect that approximately 50% of the time, the estimated 50% credible interval for the

parameter will contain the true value of that parameter (Appendix D). Each of these scenarios

were simulated 100 times. All data was simulated using the R statistical software version 4.0.2

(R Core Team, 2020b), and all Bayesian models were implemented using the R2jags package

(Su and Yajima, 2020).

B.1 Simulation Study Results

The results of the small-scale simulation study, which was composed of data simulated for ﬁve

species at 10 sites, over ﬁve years, is shown in Table 3. The results of the large-scale simulation

study, which contained 10 species, 100 sites and 10 years, is shown in Table 4.

24

B.1.1 MNM Model

The large-scale simulation study (Table 4) produced reliable estimates for latent abundance 𝑁

at every combination of 𝑝 and 𝜆, with CCC values between 0.97 and 0.99. Estimates of 𝑁 from

the small-scale simulation study (Table 3) appear more dependent on the detection probability

𝑝, with greater CCC values associated with larger detection probabilities.

From Table 4, the relative bias for the estimate of 𝑝 shows that when 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 are large,

the model produces estimates for 𝑝 which are accurate to two decimal places. When, 𝑅, 𝑇 and

𝑆 are small (Table 3), the relative bias for the estimate of 𝑝 is larger for small median 𝑝. When

𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 are small, larger values of 𝑝 produce more reliable estimates of 𝑝.

Estimates for the correlation matrix and 𝝁𝑎 improve with larger values of 𝜆. In both Table

3 and Table 4, the relative bias for 𝝁𝑎 and the CMD decrease when 𝜆 is larger. Larger values

of 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 produce more accurate estimates of the inter-species correlations and 𝝁𝑎, as can

be seen by the decrease in the sizes of the CMD and RB(𝝁𝑎) between Table 3 and Table 4.

Coverage probabilities (Appendix D) for this model reveal that both small- and large-

scale simulations produce parameters whose true value lie within the 50% credible interval

approximately 50% of the time, as expected.

B.1.2 Autoregressive Model

At both small- (Table 3) and large-scale simulations (Table 4), the autoregressive model pro-

duced reliable estimates for 𝑁, with CCC values above 0.9 for all simulations. Both the Table

3 and Table 4 see CMD values accurate to two decimal places. Relative bias for 𝑝 decreases as

median 𝑝 increases. This can be seen for both small (Table 3) and large (Table 4) values of 𝑅,

𝑇, and 𝑆. In Table 3, relative bias for the autocorrelation coeﬃcient 𝜙 is much larger for small

abundance. In this situation, the estimates for the autocorrelation coeﬃcient 𝜙 cannot be relied

upon. This is an issue that persists, though not as severely, as 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 increase in Table 4.

All parameters in this model have coverage probabilities of approximately 50%, as is

expected for the 50% credible intervals (Appendix D).

Table 4: Results of large-scale simulation ((𝑅, 𝑇, 𝑆, 𝐾) = (100, 10, 10, 10)): Concordance Correla-
tion Coeﬃcient (CCC) for the estimates of latent abundance 𝑁, Correlation Matrix Distance (CMD)
for the estimate of the inter-species correlations, and relative biases for probability of detection (𝑝),
probability of obtaining a zero count (𝜃), and autocorrelation coeﬃcient (𝜙).

27

B.1.3 Hurdle Model

Similar to the MNM model, when 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 are large (Table 4), consistently accurate estimates

of latent abundance 𝑁 are produced, with CCC values between 0.948 and 0.999. In Table 3 we

see that CCC values depend more on the detection probability, with more accurate estimates of

𝑁 produced when detection probability is high. Both Table 3 and Table 4 show higher accuracy

in estimates of the inter-species correlations when zero-inﬂation is small, and abundance is

large. CMD values are greater when 𝜃 = 0.7 or median 𝜆 = 7 than for 𝜃 = 0.2 or median 𝜆 = 55.

From both Table 3 and Table 4, the Hurdle model sees much smaller relative bias for 𝑝 when

median 𝑝 is large compared to when median 𝑝 is small. Relative bias for 𝜃 decreases when 𝜃

increases, indicating that 𝜃 is estimated with more accuracy when zero-inﬂation is large. Table

4 sees smaller relative bias for 𝜃 than Table 3, revealing that the strength of zero-inﬂation 𝜃 is

estimated more accurately when 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 are large.

Issues with parameter convergence were encountered when ﬁtting the Hurdle model. When

zero-inﬂation and abundance are large, and detection probability is small, issues with conver-

gence occurred in up to 20% of parameters. While this convergence issue does not appear to

negatively aﬀect the relative biases of parameter estimates, as can be seen in Table 3 and Table

4, coverage probability for detection probability 𝑝 and random eﬀect mean 𝜇𝑎 is negatively

impacted (Appendix D). We also see coverage for 𝑁 which is larger than 50%. This is to be

expected, and due to zero counts being perfectly predicted.

B.1.4 Hurdle-Autoregressive Model

In Table 3, CCC values demonstrate that the Hurdle-AR model produces estimates for 𝑁

which are more accurate when the probability of obtaining a zero count is smaller. However,

increasing 𝑅, 𝑇, and 𝑆 (Table 4) reduces this dependence on 𝜃, and all CCC values produced

are greater than 0.95.

The small-scale simulation (Table 3) has CMD values and relative biases for 𝑝 and 𝝁𝑎

which increase when the probability of obtaining a zero count increases, indicating that the

inter-species correlations, 𝑝 and 𝝁𝑎 are estimated more accurately when the degree of zero-

inﬂation is low. The same is true for the large-scale simulation (Table 4), though the diﬀerences

28

in CMD and relative biases between small 𝜃 and large 𝜃 are not as large, revealing that the

increase in 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 renders the increase in zero-inﬂation less important in the estimation of

these parameters.

The Hurdle-AR model suﬀers with the same issue estimating 𝜙 when the probability of

obtaining a zero count is high. This issue is more severe in Table 3, and estimates of 𝜙 cannot

be trusted when 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 are small but 𝜃 is large. Like the AR model, this issue is not as

acute in Table 4, as an increase in 𝑅, 𝑇 and 𝑆 appears to compensate for the problems caused

by large zero-inﬂation.
