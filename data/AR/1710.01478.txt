Abstract
We have investigated the combined eﬀect of low-energy self-implantation and thermal annealing on the near-surface defect con-
centration of ZnO single-crystals. Using ionoluminescence (IL), we demonstrate that a combination of low-energy low-ﬂuence Zn
and O ion implantation followed by annealing in Ar increases the near-surface point defect concentration in ZnO by two orders of
magnitude. Point defects are known to increase the surface reactivity of ZnO, thereby improving the eﬃciency of ZnO photocata-
lytic processes such as bilirubin degredation. We hereby provide recommendations on how to improve the eﬃciency of ZnO-related
photocatalytic processes.

1. Introduction

Toxic wastes substances, ranging from industrial eﬄuents to
metabolic bi-products, are matters of serious health and envir-
onmental concern. Photocatalysis is currently an important eco-
friendly and cost eﬀective method for such waste treatment.

In an ideal photocatalytic process, organic pollutants are min-
eralized into CO2, H2O and mineral acids in the presence of a
photocatalyst, typically a metallic oxide semiconductor, and an
oxidizing species such as air. When semiconductors are ex-
posed to light in solution, electrons-hole (e-h) pairs are gen-
erated. These e-h pairs aid the splitting of water into the hy-
droxyl (·OH) and superoxide (·O –
·OH is an ex-
tremely strong non-selective oxidant which leads to partial or
complete mineralization of most organic pollutants. A typical
photocatalytic process is illustrated in Fig. 1.

strungtium titanate (SrTiO3) and hematite (α-Fe2O3). Of these,
ZnO is particularly attractive for photocatalysis due to a number
of reasons. Firstly, ZnO is biocompartible, biodegradable and
non-toxic [1]. Secondly, it has a high surface reactivity induced
by native point defects [2]. Thirdly, the ability to tune ZnO band
gap Eg through doping [3] gives it a higher photoeﬃciency in
direct sunlight whose UV composition on Earth is signiﬁcanlty
low (4-7 %). Lastly, ZnO is inexpensive and its nanostructures
can be easily synthesized using a variety of methods.

Recently, Bora et al.

[4] investigated bilirubin (BR) de-
gradation in the presence of ZnO nanoparticles and UV light.
They directly showed that ZnO nano-structures with a higher
near-surface defect (particularly oxygen vacancy) concentra-
tion greatly accelerated bilirubin degredation in the presence of
UV light, Fig. 2. Paradoxically, the primary method for oxygen
vacancy (VO) generation in ZnO for Bora and co-workers was
by thermal annealing of ZnO in air (O2). But, ﬁrst-principle
calculations show that the formation energy Ef of VO in excess
O is relatively high compared to that of VO in excess Zn [5].
Therefore, thermal annealing of ZnO in O2 is not the best ap-
proach for enhancing the near-surface VO concentration in ZnO
for photocatalytic purposes.

In a recent study [6], we demonstrated that a judicious com-
bination of ion implantation and thermal annealing can better
enhance the near surface defect concentration of ZnO.

We hereby investigate the combined eﬀect of low-energy ion
implantation and thermal annealing on the near-surface defect
concentration of ZnO single-crystals. Our results show that the
near-surface defect concentration in ZnO can be signiﬁcantly
enhanced through a careful combination of self-implantation
and thermal annealing in Ar. Particularly, we show that by
simply annealing pristine ZnO in Ar at 1000 ◦C for 1 hour, the
near surface defect concentration increases by a factor of 30.

Implantations were carried out in a vacuum chamber with
pressure P = 10−7 Torr. The O- and Zn- beam current densit-
ies were 6 µA cm-2 and 0.24 µA cm-2, respectively. Ion beams
were generated by a source for negative ions by cesium sputter-
ing (SNICS) [7]. For all practical purposes, it does not matter
whether implantation is made with positive or negative ions.
To restore bulk crystallinity while simultaneously increasing
the near-surface point defect concentration, samples were an-
nealed under Ar and O2 at 1000 ◦C. All samples were then ir-
radiated by 2 MeV He+ ions and the resultant ionoluminescent
(IL) spectra obtained. Details of the IL process are described in
Ref. [6]. IL spectra for all samples were then analysed.
The relative near-surface defect concentration for each sample
was monitored using an enhancement parameter deﬁned by

η = (Ig−y/Iuv),

Double-face EPI-polished 5 × 5 × 0.5 mm wafers of hydro-
thermally grown (MTI Corporation, Richmond, CA) c-plane
ZnO single-crystals were used in this experiment. Sample
purity was greater than 99.99 % with minute traces of Mg
< 0.0005 %, Al < 0.003 %, Si < 0.003 %, Ti < 0.001 %, Cu
< 0.003 %, Fe < 0.005 %, Ca < 0.0005 %, and Ag < 0.0002 %,

where Ig−y and Iuv are the green-yellow and UV luminescent
band intensities, respectively. The smaller this ratio is, the bet-
ter the crystalline quality [8].

At high ﬂuences (φ (cid:62) 1016 cm – 2), sputtering, and ion-beam
induced migration of atoms can signiﬁcantly reduce the projec-
ted range Rp and ion concentration. Thus, ﬂuence-dependent
depth distribution for implant species was estimated using the
equation, [9, 10]:

where x is the depth coordinate with respect to the instantan-
eous target (or substrate) surface, N is the atomic density of the
substrate, Y is the sputtering yield, ∆Rp is the range straggling
related to Rp and “erf( )” is the error function. All ﬁtting para-
meters to Eq. 2 were obtained from computer simulations with
the SRIM2008 [11] code.

sharp UV emission peak centered around 3.2 eV, a broad green-
yellow emission peak centered around 2.4 eV, and a small red
emission peak centered around 1.6 eV. We observe signiﬁc-
ant enhancement of Ig-y for the annealed samples compared to
pristine ZnO. A low Ig-y and correspondingly high Iuv in the
pristine sample signiﬁes very small near-surface defect concen-
tration in agreement with the high crystalline quality of this
pristine sample. On the other hand, the high Ig-y for annealed
ZnO samples indicate an increase in their near-surface defect
concentration. Particularly, Ig-y(ZnOAr) = 3 Ig-y(ZnOO2 ) sug-
gesting that the near surface defect concentration in ZnOAr is at
least 3 times that in ZnOO2 (i.e., ηAr (cid:62) 3 ηO2

Previously we demonstrated that the 2.4 eV peak is mostly
related to near surface VO and presumably Zni concentra-
tions [6]. Although both defects have almost the same defect-
formation energy Ef, according to ﬁrst principle calculations
[5], the defect-migration-barrier potential for Zni is lower than
that for VO. Thus, Zni are more mobile than VO. This implies
that both defects are created with equal ease but Zni are likely
to anneal faster. Therefore, we deduce that the the luminescent
eﬀect of Zni on the 2.4 eV peak is minimal.

).

During ZnO annealing under ambient O2, the rate of near-
surface VO annihilation is enhanced. This is because ambient
O2 diﬀuses into the ZnO bulk recombining with some VO. This
explains why Ig-y(ZnOAr) = 3 Ig-y(ZnOO2 ).

main constantly at 87 nm, that for Zn implant shifts towards
the surface from 20 nm to 15 nm as ﬂuence doubles from
8 × 1015 to 1.6 × 1016 cm−2. This is due to the relatively high
sputtering rate of ZnO induced by Zn ions. In fact, under our
experimental conditions, the estimated sputtering yields due to
Zn- and O- ions are 13 atoms/ion and 2 atoms/ion, respectively.
Although Zn and O implant concentrations roughly double as
corresponding ﬂuences double, Zn implants at high ﬂuence are
likely to reach the ZnO target surface earlier and anneal out
faster than those at low ﬂuence upon heat treatement. This is
due to smaller instantaneous Rp, narrower distribution proﬁle
and higher mobility of Zni compared to low ﬂuence Zn and O
implants.

ZnO based on Eq. 2 which appropriately accounts for target sputtering.

3.2. IL Analysis

Figure 5: IL spectra of ZnO single-crystal; as received and 60 keV ﬁxed ﬂuence
(8 × 1015 cm−2) O- and Zn- implanted. There is a signiﬁcant drop in the UV
emission band but no enhancement in green-yellow emission band.

Ion implantation is another eﬀective method of introducing
point defects in ZnO. Fig. 5 compares the IL spectra of Zn – and
O – implanted ZnO with that of pristine ZnO single-crystal. A
drop in Iuv for as-implanted samples clearly indicates the pres-
ence of point defects resulting from radiation damage. Paradox-
ically, there is no corresponding enhancement of Ig-y. This is
due to the intensiﬁcation of competitive non-radiation pathways
induced by stress ﬁelds generated in the implantation layer.
Thermal annealing is an eﬀective way to relax bonds thereby
suppressing these non-radiation pathways.

For the Ar and O2 annealed samples, Ig-y(ZnOAr) = 3 Ig-y(ZnOO2 ).

Figure 6: IL spectra of annealed ﬁxed ﬂuence (8 × 1015 cm−2) 60 keV O- and
Zn- implanted ZnO single-crystals. The green-yellow luminescence intensity
in both samples is greatly enhanced in equal proportions.

Fig. 6 shows the eﬀect of thermal annealing on the IL spec-
tra of self-implanted ZnO single-crystals. We observe signi-
ﬁcant equal enhancement of Ig-y for both the ZnO:8OAr and
ZnO:8ZnAr samples. In fact, Ig-y for both samples is more than
3 times that for the ZnOAr sample and more than 9 times that
for the O2 annealed ZnO shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand,
Iuv for both ZnO:8OAr and ZnO:8ZnAr samples is slightly less
than that for pristine ZnO. Using Eq. 1, we estimate the relative
defect concentration ratios η/ηo for ZnO:8OAr and ZnO:8ZnAr
samples at 56 and 72 respectively; ηo being the near-surface
defect parameter for pristine ZnO.

ied by corresponding decrease in both Iuv. Using Eq. 1, the rel-
ative defect concentrations for ZnO:16OAr and ZnO:16ZnAr are
respectively 125 and 104. These values are almost double those
obtained for samples ZnO:8OAr and ZnO:8ZnAr.

4. Summary and Conclusions

We have used a combination of thermal annealing, and low-
energy self-implantation to modulate the near-surface native-
point-defect concentration of ZnO single-crystals. Using ion
beam induced luminescence, we have estimated the near-
surface defect enhancement factor of our modiﬁed samples.
Our results are summarised in Table 2. We observe that by
simply annealing pristine ZnO single-crystals in O2 and Ar,
their near surface defect concentration, relative to pristine ZnO,
increase by factors of 7 and 30, respectively. Low-energy self-
implantation followed by thermal annealing further increases
the samples’ near-surface defect concentration upto 125 times
that of pristine ZnO.

Thus, we an eﬀective practical method for enhancing the
photocatalytic activity of ZnO nano-structures in large scale ap-
plications is to anneal them under ambient Ar rather than O2.
Furthermore, irradiating ZnO nano-structures with low-energy
low-ﬂuence O – or Zn – ions followed by thermal annealing in
Ar will greatly enhance their photocatalytic eﬃciency by even
higher others of magnitude.
