The energy diﬀerences between the face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal closed packed (HCP)
structures of the argon (Ar) crystal are studied using the ﬁrst-principles electronic-structure ap-
proach at the level of random phase approximation (RPA) plus renormalized single exitation (rSE)
correction. By treating both structures at equal footing (i.e., employing the same computational
supercell and k grid sampling), our RPA+rSE calculations show that, at zero temperature, the
FCC structure is lower in energy than the HCP structure over a wide pressure range. The inﬂuence
of zero-point energy (ZPE) is also studied and and it is found that ZPE only plays a secondary
role in determining the relative stability of the two structures, whereas the electron correlation ef-
fect dominates. We further examine the equation of states in the high pressure regime, and our
RPA+rSE results, complemented with phonon contributions, show excellent agreement with avail-
able experimental data. Finally, by computing the Gibbs free energies for both the FCC and HCP
at diﬀerent temperatures, we are able to generate a T -P phase diagram for the Ar crystal, disclosing
the pressure-temperature range for each phase. Our calculations reveal that the FCC phase has a
slightly larger entropy and volume than HCP phase at the same temperature and pressure condition.

INTRODUCTION

An essential goal of computational physical science is
to reliably predict the relevant polymorphs and their rel-
ative stability, and consequently the thermodynamic be-
havior of a substance, with only knowledge of its chemical
composition. This challenge largely persists even today
after it was noted over 30 years ago [1]. Nevertheless,
considerable progress has been made towards this goal,
thanks to the development of various structure prediction
algorithms [2–6] as well as the continuing methodology
and accuracy advances of ﬁrst-principles calculations [7–
12]. Nowadays, it is not uncommon for the mainstream
crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods to predict
the relevant known and unknown polymorphic forms of
a material, as well as their energy separations, start-
ing with a pre-given chemical composition. However,
the output of such predictions, in particular the energy
ranking of diﬀerent polymorphs will necessarily depend
on the underlying electronic structure methods for com-
puting the potential energy surface. For instance, most
CSP algorithms can predict the existence of diamond and
graphene allotropes for carbon, but cannot tell graphene
is thermodynamically more stable at ambient conditions,
if conventional local/semilocal density functional approx-
imations (DFAs) are employed as the electronic structure
solver. Similar issues occurs if one quests for whether
the face-centered cubic (FCC) or hexagonal close packed
(HCP) crystal structure is preferred for rare gas crystals
under ambient pressure [13, 14]. Thus, in the long-term
endeavor aiming at quantitatively and faithfully predict

the thermodynamical behavior of real materials without
invoking empirical inputs, further improving the accu-
racy and reliability of the underlying electronic structure
methods that can be conveniently used together with the
CSP algorithms is a must.

In fact, the above-noted phase stability of rare-gas
crystals has posed a signiﬁcant challenge to ﬁrst prin-
ciples electronic structure methods.
In particular, it is
theoretically highly nontrivial to describe the delicate
energy diﬀerences between the FCC and HCP phases
at zero temperature, for which a sub-meV accuracy is
mandatory. Without a solid base at 0 K, it is then highly
unlikely that one can convincingly explain why rare gas
atoms prefer to crystallize in the FCC phase instead
of the HCP phase under ambient pressures, let alone
the entire phase diagram of the rare-gas systems under
varying thermodynamic conditions. Within the realm
of ﬁrst principles electronic structure theories, conven-
tional local and semilocal DFAs [15, 16] are unable to re-
liably describe the cohesive properties of rare-gas systems
due to their inadequate treatment of long-range van der
Waals (vdW) interactions. Complementing semi-local
functionals with semiempirical vdW corrections [17–20]
or non-local vdW density functionals [21, 22] can sig-
niﬁcantly improve their usefulness in describing vdW-
bonded systems, but it is questionable whether these
pragmatic vdW-inclusive schemes can provide the needed
(sub-meV) accuracy in order to describe the phase stabil-
ity of rare-gas crystals. Beyond these approximations one
may either go to the ﬁfth-rung functionals [23] (e.g., the
random phase approximation (RPA) [24–28] and beyond
[29, 30]) within the realm of the density functional the-
ory (DFT) where non-local electron correlation eﬀects are
seamlessly incorporated, or simply go to wave-function
based approaches, like the second-order Møller-Plesset

 
 
 
 
 
 
perturbation theory (MP2) [31] and the coupled cluster
(CC) theory [32]. However, MP2, which contains only
two-body (here “body” means atom) correlations, is con-
sidered not suﬃciently accurate to describe the cohesive
properties of rare-gas crystals [33–35].

In the connection, the CC theory truncated at the
level of single, double, and perturbative triple excitations
(CCSD(T)) [36] (known as “gold standard” in computa-
tional chemistry) is of great interest and has been ap-
plied to study the cohesive properties of rare-gas sys-
tems [33–35, 37–42]. However, in these studies, instead
of directly applying CCSD(T) to treat inﬁnite periodic
rare-gas crystals, one utilizes the method only to generate
the short-range part of the potential energy landscapes of
trimers and tetramers. The entire cohesive energies are
obtained by summing up two-body, three-body, and four-
body contributions, with each of them being calculated
by summing over suﬃciently large atomic clusters in real
space. The interactions between atomic pairs, as well
as the long-range part of the interactions within trimers
and tetramers are being described by empirical model
potentials. Thus this is a rather sophisticated approach
that combines many ingredients into a framework, and
necessarily depends on many parameters. Despite the
remarkable accuracy this approach delivers and its suc-
cessful explanation of the preference to the FCC phase
of rare-gas crystals [40], it is rather tedious to use for
non-experts and barely suitable for routine applications,
in particular in the context of high-throughput compu-
tations.

In this work, we present a detailed study of the per-
formance of RPA and beyond for computing the cohesive
energies of the Ar crystal, with special emphasis on the
energy diﬀerences between the FCC and HCP phases.
Here RPA refers to a theoretical approach for comput-
ing the ground-state total energy of many-electron sys-
tems, in a way that the exchange energy is evaluated
exactly and the electron correlation energy is treated at
the direct RPA level. The exchange-correlation (XC) en-
ergy of the RPA method can be viewed as an orbital-
dependent energy functional derived within the frame-
work of adiabatic-connection ﬂuctuation-dissipation the-
orem of DFT [25, 26, 43], but it is also intimately con-
nected to the CC theory [44]. One particularly appealing
aspect of RPA is that it provides a balanced description
of all bonding characteristics, including a seamless incor-
poration of vdW interactions. Early benchmark studies
indicated that RPA (and beyond) is capable of describ-
ing delicate energy diﬀerences [28]. This is corroborated
by more recent studies that revealed that RPA yields the
correct energy ranking of diﬀerent polymorphs of several
types of materials, including carbon allotropes [45], FeS2
[46], BN [47], as well as a few others [48].

Despite its success, the standard RPA scheme shows
an overall tendency of underestimating the binding en-
ergies of molecules and solids [49, 50], and this under-
estimation can be largely alleviated by adding a correc-
tion term arising from single excitations [51]. In partic-

2

ular, the renormalzied single excitation (rSE) correction
has been shown to appreciably improve the accuracy of
the standard RPA for describing the binding strengths of
molecules and solids [30, 52, 53]. In this work, we apply
the RPA+rSE method [30] to study the energy diﬀerence
between the FCC and HCP structures of the Ar crystal.
Here, instead of resorting to a tedious cluster-based ap-
proach [37–42], we directly treat the crystal as a periodic
system in terms of k point sampling. We ﬁnd that, in
order to capture the delicate energy diﬀerences between
the FCC and HCP structures, it is important to treat the
two structures at an equal footing, i.e., setting up a com-
putational cell that is the same for the FCC and HCP
crystal structures and performing calculations with the
k point setting. Test calculations show that using their
primitive unit cells of these two structures (and hence
diﬀerent k point setting) will not provide suﬃcient nu-
merical precision. With the above-noted computational
strategy, and by carefully converging all the computa-
tional parameters, we found that the RPA+rSE cohesive
energy for the FCC phase is lower by around 3.6 µHa (∼
0.1 meV) than that of the HCP phase at zero tempera-
ture and ambient pressure. The zero-point energy (ZPE),
which was previously suggested to be vital for stabilizing
the FCC phase [38–40], is found to only play a secondary
role here. Furthermore, by including the contributions of
phonon energies, we calculate the Helmholtz free energy
and derive the pressure-volume (P -V ) curves at room
temperatures. Our results show excellent agreement with
available experimental data in the high-pressure regime,
which was previously considered to be a challenging prob-
lem for the Ar crystal [42]. Finally, by computing the
Gibbs free energy for both phases, we are able to deter-
mine the phase boundary of the FCC and HCP phases
in the temperature-pressure (T -P ) phase diagrams. The
behavior of the phase boundary line can be understood
from the perspective that the FCC phase has a slightly
large entropy and volume that the HCP phase at the
same temperature and pressure condition.

Our investigation suggests that the combination of ad-
vanced electronic structure calculations at the level of
RPA and beyond with reliable estimations of phonon
energies is a powerful approach to study the thermody-
namic properties of condensed matter systems. Since the
implementation of such approach has been available in
several mainstream computer code and the barrier of em-
ploying such an approach for routine application is not
high, we expect this approach will become highly use-
ful for treating challenging problem when unprecedented
accuracy is required.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Cohesive energy curves for the Ar crystal. We
start by ﬁrst looking at the performance of RPA+rSE
for describing the cohesive property of the Ar crystal.
In Fig. 1 we present the cohesive energies as a function

of the lattice constant for the FCC Ar crystal, as deter-
mined by various functionals, including RPA@PBE and
(RPA+rSE)@PBE. Here “@PBE” denotes that the cal-
culations are done on top of the reference wavefunctions
generated by a preceding KS calculation based on the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew,
Burke, and Ernzerhof [16]. For comparison, results ob-
tained using other functionals,
including local-density
approximation (LDA), GGA-PBE itself, the global hy-
brid functional PBE0 [54], the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
(HSE) screened hybrid functional [9], as well as PBE
complemented with the Tkatchenko-Scheﬄer (TS) vdW
correction (vdW(TS)) [19] and with the more sophisti-
cated many-body dispersion (MBD) [20], are also pre-
sented. In addition, the experimental equilibrium lattice
constant and cohesive energy are indicated by dashed
lines in Fig. 1. All calculations are done using the FHI-
aims code package [29, 55], based on an all-electron, nu-
meric atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis set framework.
The correlation-consistent NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets [56]
are used in the calculations. Since correlated methods
like RPA and beyond have diﬀerent basis set dependence
behavior compared to the conventional functionals, the
presented RPA and RPA+rSE results are those extrap-
olated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit, whereas
the results of other functionals are obtained with NAO-
VCC-4Z basis set. Further computational details of these
calculations are given in Sec. IV. Figure 1 clearly shows
that a quantitatively accurate description of the cohesive
properties of the Ar crystal is highly challenging for ﬁrst-
principles approaches. While LDA displays a pronounced
artiﬁcial overbinding, GGA-PBE shows the opposite be-
havior. Going from PBE to the hybrid functionals does
not improve the situation, due to the fact that long-
range vdW interactions are missing in both types of func-
tionals. Complementing the PBE functional with semi-
empirical vdW corrections signiﬁcantly improves the co-
hesive energies, as shown by by PBE+vdW(TS) and
PBE+MBD curves in Fig. 1, but the equilibrium lat-
tice constant is still appreciably overestimated. In case
of RPA-based approaches, RPA@PBE performs signiﬁ-
cantly better than LDA, GGA, and hybrid functionals,
and the obtained equilibrium lattice constant (5.365 ˚A) is
in excellent agreement with the experimental value (5.311
˚A). However, similar to the Ar dimer (Ar2) case [51],
RPA@PBE underestimates the cohesive energies. Fi-
nally, when adding the rSE correction, this underbinding
is largely alleviated, and the (RPA+rSE)@PBE cohesive
energy curve shows a rather satisfactory agreement with
the experimental data, despite that a slight underestima-
tion of the cohesive energy is still noticeable. It should
be noted that RPA [57] and RPA+rSE [53] have been
previously applied to the FCC phase of the Ar crystal,
using an independent implementation based on projector
augmented wave (PAW) method and plane-wave basis set
[58]. In their paper [53], an even better agreement of the
RPA+rSE cohesive energy with the experimental result
was reported. We expect such a slight diﬀerence arising

FIG. 1. Cohesive energies of the FCC Ar crystal determined
by diﬀerent functionals. All calculations are done using the
FHI-aims code package [29, 55] and NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets
[56]. The RPA and RPA+rSE results are obtained by extrap-
olating the NAO-VCC-3Z and 4Z results to the complete basis
set (CBS) limit, and all other results are obtained using the
NAO-VCC-4Z basis set. A primitive unit cell and 10×10×10

tion is not included here. Experimental values are taken from
Ref. [59].

Energy diﬀerences between FCC and HCP
structures. Encouraged by the excellent performance
of RPA+rSE for describing the cohesive properties of the
Ar crystal, we set out to examine the energy diﬀerence of
the FCC and HCP structures of Ar using this approach.
Here we stress that it is rather challenging to numeri-
cally capture the delicate energy diﬀerences of the two
structures, due to the fact that they have diﬀerent prim-
itive unit cells, and a ﬁnite k-point sampling based on
the primitive cells leads to an unbalanced description of
the two structures. To deal with this problem, we set up
a 1 × 1 × 6 supercell for both structures, whereby the z
axis is chosen along the [111] direction of the FCC struc-
ture and the c direction of the HCP structure, respec-
tively. This results in a supercell with ABCABC stack-
ing for the FCC structure and with ABABAB stacking
for the HCP structure. Then by utilizing the same set-
ting for k-point mesh (12 × 12 × 2 in the present case),
one achieves a numerical description of both structures
on an equal footing. As a consequence, the target energy
diﬀerences of the two structures are least prone to possi-
ble numerical errors arising from the under-convergence
of computational parameters.
In Fig. 2, we plot the
energy diﬀerences of the cohesive energies of the FCC
and HCP structures obtained by PBE, PBE+MBD, and
(RPA+rSE)@PBE as a function of the volume. It can be
seen that, most strikingly, the (RPA+rSE)@PBE yields

proaches. Also shown are the (RPA+rSE)@PBE cohesive en-
ergy complemented with ZPE at the PBE level, denoted as
“RPA+rSE+ZPE”. Results from RPA+rSE and ZPE@PBE
are extrapolated to CBS(3,4), while those from other func-
tionals are obtained using NAO-VCC-4Z basis set. The pre-
sented curves are obtained by subtracting the corresponding

a lower energy for the FCC phase than the HCP phase
over a wide volume range. The energy preference to
the FCC phase is approximately 3.5 µHa at the ambi-
ent pressure, and reaches its maximum (∼ 10 µHa) at
a compressed volume of approximately 22 ˚A3 per atom.
The energy diﬀerence is reduced when the system is fur-
ther compressed, until the HCP phase is favored at even
higher pressures (smaller volumes).
In contrast to the
RPA+rSE results, the PBE and PBE+MBD yield al-
most identical cohesive energies for the two phases over
a large volume range, and only at very high pressures
the HCP strutur becomes clearly favored. Furthermore,
comparing the PBE and PBE+MBD results reveals that
the long-range vdW interactions do not play a role in dis-
cerning the energy diﬀerence of the two phases, although
they do contribute signiﬁcantly to the cohesive energies
of each individual phase. Last but not least, the compar-
ison of RPA+rSE and PBE+MBD results provides ad-
ditional insights. It should be noted that MBD captures
the many-body coupling among the atoms at the RPA
level, with each individual atom treated as a harmonic
oscillator[20]. The diﬀerent behaviors of PBE+MBD and
(RPA+rSE)@PBE in Fig. 2 suggests that it is really the
many-body correlations at the electronic level that makes
a qualitative diﬀerence here.

In addition to the electronic energies,

it has been
pointed out in the past that the ZPE plays an essen-

4

tial role in stabilizing the FCC phase over the HCP
phase [38–40]. To check this point, we further add
the diﬀerences of the ZPE contributions of the two
phases to the RPA+rSE results, and plot the resultant
RPA+rSE+ZPE results in Fig. 2 (blue curve). It can be
seen that the ZPE contribution indeed favors the FCC
phase, shifting the entire EFCC − EHCP curve further
down. However, its eﬀect is much smaller in magnitude
compared to the electron correlation eﬀect described by
RPA+rSE. It should be noted that in Fig. 2 the ZPE con-
tributions are calculated using the PBE functional within
the harmonic approximation. In principle, it would be
ideal if the phonon frequencies were evaluated by the
RPA+rSE approach. Unfortunately, at present our im-
plementation does not yet allow one to compute the
phonon spectra according to the RPA+rSE potential en-
ergy surface, and evaluate the ZPE contributions at the
RPA+rSE level. However, as shown in Fig. S1 of the sup-
porting material (SM) , we have checked the ZPEs using
LDA, PBE and PBE+MBD functionals (among which
the cohesive behavior of RPA+rSE sits in between), and
conﬁrmed that the ZPE contribution to the energy dif-
ference does not change appreciably with respect to the
underlying functionals. We thus expect that the scenario
illustrated in in Fig. 2 does not change if RPA+rSE were
used to evaluate the ZPEs. The anharmonic correction
to the ZPE has also been considered in the literature [40],
but its eﬀect is rather small and neglected here.

The P -V curve in the high-pressure regime. Be-
sides the mystery regarding the preferred crystal struc-
ture at ambient pressure, the rare-gas systems in the
high-pressure regime also exhibit fascinating phenomena.
These include the pressure-induced structural phase tran-
sition from FCC to HCP (or to other structures at even
higher pressures), the change of electronic structure, e.g.,
the narrowing of the band gap and/or the change of con-
ductance [60], as well as the rearrangement of electronic
states [61], etc. Even superconductivity has been pre-
dicted to exist at very high pressures [62]. Considerable
eﬀorts have been devoted to understanding the physi-
cal properties of rare gas systems under high pressure
[42, 61, 63–65]. In particular, Schwerdtfeger and cowork-
ers [42, 66] derived the volume and temperature depen-
dence of the the pressure – P (V, T ) – for both Ne and Ar
crystals from the Helmholtz free energy, which consists
of a static term determined from many-body expansion
based on the CC theory and a dynamical term deter-
mined from lattice vibrations. While excellent agreement
with experiment was found for Ne up to 200 GPa [66], a
comparable level of agreement was only achieved up to
20 GPa for Ar at room temperature [42]. In the pressure
range of 20-100 GPa, appreciable discrepancy between
calculated results and experiment was observed. As such,
a theoretical description of the equation of state at high
pressure reaching the experimental accuracy was consid-
ered to be a signiﬁcant challenge for the Ar crystal [42].
To check how RPA+rSE performs in the high-
pressure regime, we here also determine the equation

 
of state P (V, T ) from the Helmholtz free energy via
P (V, T ) = −∂F (V, T )/∂V |T , whereby the expression of
the Helmholtz free energy is presented in Sec. IV (Eq. 5).
In brief, the static part of the Helmholtz energy in our
calculations is given by RPA+rSE total energy, whereas
the ZPE and lattice thermodynamic vibration contribu-
tions are determined from the phonon spectrum based on
PBE calculations. The possible inﬂuence of the underly-
ing XC functional for evaluating the phonon spectra on
the P -V curve is examined in Fig. S2 of the SM, whereby
one can see again that varying the functional has negli-

as a function of V at T = 300 K are presented for the
FCC phase of the Ar crystal. For comparison, the cal-
culated results of Schwerdtfeger et al. [42] as well as the
experimental results [67–69] are also included. To stay
away from the melting point (the melting pressure Pmelt
and volume Vmelt at 300 K are estimated to be 1.353
3
GPa and 32.64˚A
in Refs. [70, 71]), only the compressed
3
volume regime with V < 32˚A
was considered in our
investigation. Figure 3 shows that our calculated P -V
results are in very good agreement with the experimen-
tal data of Ross et al. [69] extracted from static pressure
measurements and of Errandonea et al.
[68] extracted
from dispersive x-ray diﬀraction measurements up to 50
GPa. In addition to the FCC phase, we also calculated
the P -V curve in the high-pressure regime for the HCP
phase, but its diﬀerence from that of the FCC phase in
the scale of Fig. 3 is tiny. Overall, it seems that our ap-
proach describes the equation of states in high-pressure
regime rather well, in contrast with the CC-based many-
body expansions. Schwerdtfeger et al. [42] attributed the
disparity of their results from experiment to the missing
4-body and higher body eﬀects within their approach
and the possible inaccuracy of CCSD(T). In our case,
RPA+rSE is less accurate than CCSD(T), but our cal-
culations account for the many-body eﬀects to inﬁnite
order. From this perspective, we propose that it is most
likely not the method of CCSD(T) itself, but rather the
limited order of the many-body expansion that is respon-
sible for the discrepancy observed by Schwerdtfeger et al.
[42].

The T -P phase diagram for Ar. Figure 2 signiﬁes
that at zero temperature the FCC phase can transform
into the HCP phase at a compressed volume of approx-
imately 17 ˚A3 per atom, corresponding to a pressure of
31.4 GPa, as can be inferred from Fig. 3. To investigate
how the transition pressure changes with the tempera-
ture, we calculate the Gibbs free energies G(T, P ) for
both phases at several diﬀerent temperatures, and pin-
point the boundary between the two phases in the T -P
phase diagram by equating the Gibbs free energies of the
two phases GFCC(T, P ) = GHCP(T, P ). The resultant T -
P phase diagram is presented in Fig. 4, where the bound-
ary line is determined by data points at seven diﬀerent
temperatures ranging from 0 to 300 K. One can see that
the transition pressure increases steadily from 31.4 GPa
at 0 K to about 37.0 GPa at 300 K. In Table SI of SM, we

FIG. 3. Calculated P -V diagram at 300 K for the FCC phase
of the Ar crystal. Calculations are done using the 6-atom
supercell (as Fig. 2) and the results are extrapolated to the
CBS limit. We choose RPA+rSE accomplished with phonon

present the actual values of the critical pressure and vol-
ume along the phase boundary line. The steady increase
of the transition pressure along with the temperature is
related to the diﬀerent phonon spectra of the two phases.
The lattice vibrations are such that the higher-symmetry
phase (FCC) is favored over the lower-symmetry phase at
ﬁnite temperatures, and thus a higher pressure is needed
to turn the FCC phase into the HCP one, compared to
the zero temperature case. Close inspection reveals that
the positive slope of the phase boundary is related to the
slightly larger entropy and volume of the FCC phase than
the HCP phase under the same temperature and pressure
conditions. Namely, the positive sign of ∆S/∆V across
the phase boundary line gives rise to a positive dP/dT
slope, according to the Clausius-Clapeyon relationship
(i.e., dP/dT = ∆S/∆V ) for a solid-solid phase transi-
tion.

observed that a
phase transition from FCC to HCP starts at 49.6 GPa un-
der room temperature [68], and after that the two phases
coexist over a wide pressure range. Determining the hys-
teresis region between the two solid-state phases requires
a rather long-time N P T molecular dynamics simulations
and goes beyond the scope of the present work. Quantita-
tively, our simulation seems to underestimate the transi-
tion pressure, but nevertheless predicts the correct order
of magnitude for the transition pressure. Several factors
might contribute to this underestimation. First, in the
present work, the ideal structure is used for both the FCC
and HCP phases, whereas in reality disorder and defects
play important roles. Second, the dynamics of the phase

transition process is rather complex, governed by a del-
icate interplay between energetics and kinetics, as, e.g.,
discussed in Refs. [65, 72] for the martensitic FCC-HCP
transition in solid xenon. These aspects have not been
taken into account in our studies, but needs to be taken
into account to achieve a quantitatively accurate descrip-
tion of the detailed phase transition behavior.

III. CONCLUSION

To summarize, we carried out a ﬁrst-principles study
of the energy diﬀerence and the transition between the
FCC and HCP phases of the Ar crystal. The electronic
part of the free energy is calculated at the level of RPA
plus renormalized singles corrections [30], and the ZPE
and thermodynamic lattice vibrations are determined at
the PBE level using the harmonic approximation. Our
results show that, at zero temperature, RPA+rSE pre-
dicts that the FCC structure has a lower energy than the
HCP structure at ambient and high pressures up to 30
GPa. The ZPE slightly favors the FCC structure over
the HCP one, but its eﬀect is rather tiny and one or-
der of magnitude smaller than the electron correlation
eﬀect described by RPA+rSE. Computationally, in or-
der to capture the delicate energy diﬀerence between the
two phases, it is important to treat the FCC and HCP
structure on an equal footing, i.e., adopting the same
computational unit cell and parameters for both struc-
tures.

an agreement is not achieved with the CC-based many-
body expansion approach, and has been regarded as a
signiﬁcant challenge for theoretical methods [42]. Based
on our results, we propose that the inadequacy of the
many-body expansion approach is probably due to the
missing four- and higher-body body terms, and not due
to the CCSD(T) method itself. By computing the Gibbs
free energies for both phases, we are able to determine
a T -P phase diagram of the Ar crystal. Although the
transition pressure is somewhat underestimated and no
details of the transition process is provided yet, deter-
mining a qualitatively correct phase diagram for the Ar
crystal entirely from ﬁrst principles itself is a great suc-
cess. We believe our ﬁndings presented in this work will
have signiﬁcant implications for investigating other rare-
gas systems and more complex materials in general.

IV. METHODS

Computer Code and Computational Details.
The ground-state total energy in this work is calcu-
lated using the RPA+rSE method, as is implemented
within the all-electron full-potential code package FHI-
aims [29, 55], based on the numerical atom-centered or-
bital (NAO) basis set framework. Extensive reviews of
the RPA method for many-electron ground-state energy
calculations exist in the literature [27, 28, 73] and its rSE
correction has been discussed in Refs. [30]. The numerical
details and benchmark tests for NAO-based RPA (and
rSE) implementation for ﬁnite systems (molecules and
clusters) have been presented in Refs. [29, 30, 74]. Re-
cently, this implementation has recently been extended to
periodic systems. While the details will be presented else-
where, the basic numerical techniques of periodic RPA
implementation within the NAO framework follow closely
those of periodic G0W0 implementation published re-
cently [75]. Also, the reliability of our NAO-based pe-
riodic RPA implementation has been demonstrated by
recently published benchmark-quality calculations for a
set of semiconductors [76].

The valence correlation-consistent (VCC) NAO basis
sets [56] are used in our calculations. Such basis sets
allow one extrapolate the calculated RPA+rSE results
to the CBS limit, if the following asymptotic behavior is
assumed [77]

E(n) = E(∞) − C/n3

(1)

In Eq. 1 n is the cardinal number of the NAO-VCC-nZ
basis sets [56], and C is a ﬁtting parameter. Our CBS
results for RPA+rSE are then obtained from a two-point
extrapolation with n = 3, 4 [76, 77]

E(∞) =

E(3)33 − E(4)43
33 − 43

In the high-pressure regime, our P -V curve is in excel-
lent agreement with available experimental data. Such

In the photon calculations, 12 × 12 × 6 k grid and a dis-
placement of 0.002 ˚A(for the ﬁnite displacement method)
are adopted. The inﬂuence of diﬀerent functionals on the
phonon spectra, and hence on the ﬁnal ZPE and phonon
contributions to the Helmholtz free energy is presented
in Fig. S5 of the SM.

The Gibbs free energy used to determine the T -P phase

diagram reported in Fig. 3 is given by

G(T, P ) = F (V, T ) + P V .

(6)

The Gibbs free energies are calculated separately for
the FCC and HCP phases, and the phase boundary
separating the two phases are determined by equating
GFCC(T, P ) and GHCP(T, P ) at several diﬀerent temper-
atures.

the convergence with respect to the basis set is much less
demanding. Hence, in the present work, the NAO-VCC-
nZ basis set is used for these functionals. Figure. S3 in
the SM demonstrates the basis set convergence behavior
of both RPA+rSE and PBE calculations.

As already mentioned in Sec. II, to obtain reliable en-
ergy diﬀerences between the FCC and HCP structures, it
is crucial to treat both structures on an equal footing. To
this end, 1×1×6 computational cells with ABCABC and
ABABAB stacking are used for the FCC and HCP struc-
tures, respectively. In Fig. S4, we show that if primitive
unit cell are used instead, one may easily get in incorrect
energy ordering for the two structures for the RPA+rSE
method.

The computational cost of the RPA calculations scales
as N 4
b with respect to the number of basis functions
Nb. To reduce the computational load, the NAO-VCC-
4Z RPA+rSE results for the 6-atom computational cell
at a given volume V (denoted as E4Z (V )) are obtained
from the NAO-VCC-3Z results (E3Z (V )) upon adding a
correction term that is obtained from calculations based
on the primitive unit cells,

E4Z (V ) = E3Z (V ) + Ecorr(V ) .

(12 × 12 × 6) k grids are used for the supercell and
FCC (HCP) primitive cells, respectively. Test calcula-
tions show that such a basis correction scheme only in-
troduces an error less than 0.1 µHa for the energy dif-
ferences between FCC and HCP structures, compared to

(RPA+rSE)@PBE, complemented with ZPE determined us-

curves are obtained by subtracting the corresponding cohe-
sive energy curves of the FCC and HCP structures, which
themselves are obtained by a second-order Birch-Murnaghan
ﬁtting of the original computed data.

Figure S1 shows the energy diﬀerences between the
FCC and HCP structures of the Ar crystal at zero
temperature as a function of volume, calculated us-
ing the random phase approximation (RPA) plus renor-
malized single excitation (rSE) correction [30]. The
RPA+rSE energy diﬀerences are further complemented
by zero point energy (ZPE) as determined by three dif-
ferent functionals – local-density approximation (LDA),
Perdew-Burke-Erzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient ap-
proximation (GGA), and PBE with many-body disper-
sion (MBD) [20]. It can be seen from Fig. S1 the ZPE
contribution to the energy diﬀerence is rather tiny, com-
pared to the electron energy contribution as described
by RPA+rSE. This behavior does not change if diﬀerent
functionals are used to evaluate the phonon frequencies.
From Fig.. S1 we infer that even if the RPA+rSE method
is used to calculate the phonon frequencies, the scenario
will not change.

In Fig. 3 of the main text, we presented the P -V curve
of the FCC Ar crystal in the high-pressure regime. The
curve is determined from the Helmholtz free energy with
respect to the volume V . The static (electronic) part
of the free energy is calculated using (RPA+rSE)@PBE,

FIG. S2. Calculated P -V curves at 300 K for the FCC phase
of the Ar crystal, as derived from the Helmholtz free energy.
The electronic part of the Helmholtz free energy is calculated
using RPA+rSE, whereas the phonon part is evaluated us-
ing three diﬀerent functionals: LDA, PBE, and PBE+MBD.
Calculations are done using the 6-atom supercell and the re-
sults are extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit.
Three sets of experimental data [67–69] are also presented for
comparison (cf. Fig. 3 in the main text).

whereas the lattice vibration contributions are estimated
from the phonon frequencies calculating the PBE func-
tionals. Excellent agreement with the experimental data
is observed. However, there remains the question what
happens if the phonon frequencies are calculated using a
diﬀerent functional. In Fig. S2 we present the P -V curves
with the phonon contributions calculated using LDA,
PBE, and PBE+MBD functionals. The three curves are
practically indistinguishable at the scale of Fig. S2. This
benchmark test indicates that the obtained P -V curve
is insensitive to the underlying functionals for evaluat-
ing the phonon spectrum, and our results are not biased
because of the choice of the PBE functional.

Presented in Table SI are the transition pressures
and volumes along the boundary line between the FCC
and HCP phases at seven equally separated temperature
points (0 K, 50 K, · · · , 300 K). The phase boundary
line is determined by equating the Gibbs free energies of
the FCC and HCP phases. The phonon contributions of
the Gibbs energies are evaluated using both PBE and
PBE+MBD functionals. An inspection of the results
presented in the left- and right-hand sides of Table SI
indicates that using diﬀerent functionals to evaluate the
phonon spectra has insigniﬁcant inﬂuence on the actual
phase boundary.

In Fig. S3 we present the (RPA+rSE)@PBE and PBE
cohesive energies as a function of the volume as calculated
with diﬀerent NAO-VCC-nZ [56] basis sets. One can see
that achieving basis set convergence for the correlated
method (in the present case RPA+rSE) is much more

demanding than the PBE functional which requires only
occupied-state information. Whereas the PBE results
calculated using NAO-VCC-3Z (N3Z) and NAO-VCC-4Z
(N4Z) are almost on top of each other, the RPA+rSE re-
sults shows a sizable shift towards stronger bonding when
going from N3Z to N4Z. Hence, in the present work, we
extrapolate the RPA+rSE results to the complete basis
set (CBS) limit based on the N3Z and N4Z results, where
for PBE the N4Z results are used.

FIG. S3. Calculated PBE and (RPA+rSE)@PBE cohesive
energy curves at 0 K for the FCC phase of the Ar crys-
tal, obtained using NAO-VCC-3Z and NAO-VCC-4Z basis
sets. For (RPA+rSE)@PBE, the two-point extrapolated re-
sults (CBS(3,4)) are also plotted.

Figure S4 compares two diﬀerent strategies to com-
pute the energy diﬀerences between the FCC and HCP
crystal structures. In the ﬁrst strategy, the energy dif-
ferences are calculated using the respective primitive
unit cells for both structures.
In this case, as panel
(a) shows, after converging ∆E = Efcc − Ehcp with re-
spect to the k-grid mesh, one obtains a positive value

of ∆E = 21.6 µHa/atom ≈ 0.6 meV/atom, favoring the
HCP structure. However, this is an artifact, since HCP
has a larger primitive unit cell than FCC and using the
same k grid mesh for both structures may easily pro-
duce biased results, especially when highly accurate re-
sults are hunted for. In the second strategy, 1 × 1 × 6
computational super cells (with ABCABC stacking for
FCC and ABABAB stacking for HCP) are used for
both structures. Now by converging the energy diﬀer-
ences with respect to the k-grid mesh, one obtains a
∆E = −0.4 µHa/atom, marginally favoring the FCC
structure. Please note this is the result obtained using an
under-converged NAO-VCC-3Z basis set. After extrapo-
lating the results to the CBS limit, one ends up with a
∆E ≈ −3.5µHa/atom, in favor of the FCC structure.

In Fig. S5 we present the Helmholtz free energies
(cf. Eq. 5 of the main text) as a function of the vol-
ume calculated at 300 K. Again the electronic part
of the Helmholtz free energies are calculated at the
level of (RPA+rSE)@PBE, whereas the phonon contri-
butions are evaluated using LDA, PBE, and PBE+MBD
functionals. Note that the (negative) slope of these
Helmholtz free energy yields gives the P -V curves pre-
sented in Fig. S2. For comparison, the pure electronic
(RPA+rSE)@PBE total energy is also plotted. Figure S5
reveals that the phonon contributions mainly play a role
in the low pressure (large volume) regime. In the high
pressure regime, the electronic part of the Helmholtz
free energy dominates, and it is important to adopt
the RPA+rSE method in order to achieve a quantita-
tive agreement with the experimental measurements of
the equation of states (cf. Fig. S2).
In the low pres-
sure regime, the LDA phonons yield a noticeable diﬀer-
ence to the Helmholtz free energy compared to the PBE
phonons, whereas the MBD correction brings negligible
changes. However, even the small diﬀerences between the
LDA and PBE phonon contributions become diminishing
when one looks at the derivatives of these curves, i.e., the
P -V curves as shown in Fig. S2.
