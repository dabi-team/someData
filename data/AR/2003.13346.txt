Abstract. NA61/SHINE is a multi-purpose experiment to study hadron-proton,
hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron
(SPS). The experiment performs unique measurements for the physics of strong
interactions as well as important reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray
physics.

The primary goals of the experiment are the study of the onset of deconﬁnement
and the search for the critical point of the strongly interacting matter, to uncover
the mechanism of thermalisation and to test the validity of statistical models. For
this purpose, a two-dimensional scan was performed by varying the beam momentum
(13A–158A GeV/c) and the size of colliding systems (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc,
Xe+La, Pb+Pb).

In this contribution, we present recent NA61/SHINE results on the search for
critical eﬀects in spectra and ﬂuctuations. We see no clear indication for the onset
of deconﬁnement for intermediate colliding systems. Nevertheless, results from p+p
interactions on spectra and onset of deconﬁnement reveal anomalous behaviour in
proximity to transition energy.
In ﬂuctuation analysis of collisions of medium size
nuclei at the top SPS energy, no prominent signal of critical point was observed.

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE is a multi-purpose facility measuring hadron production in hadron-proton,
hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is a ﬁxed target experiment located in
the H2 beam-line of CERN’s SPS North Area.

NA61/SHINE performed a two-dimensional scan in collision energy (13A-150A
GeV/c and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) to study the
phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. The main goals of NA61/SHINE are the
search for the critical point and a study of the onset of deconﬁnement.

2. NA61/SHINE facility

The NA61/SHINE detection system, presented in Fig. 1, is a large acceptance hadron
spectrometer with excellent capabilities in measurements of charged particles. The
spectrometer is based on a set of eight Time Projection Chambers, two of which
are placed in the superconducting magnets, complemented by three Time-of-Flight
detectors. This setup allows for precise momentum reconstruction and identiﬁcation
of charged particles. The high-resolution forward calorimeter, the Projectile Spectator

Detector (PSD), measures energy ﬂow around the beam direction, which in nucleus-
nucleus reactions is primarily a measure of the number of the projectile spectators, i.e
non-interacting projectile nucleons. Thus, the measurement of so-called Forward Energy
(FE) can be related to the violence (centrality) of the collision. The incoming beam
is monitored by a set of beam detectors, which allows to identify beam particles and
measure precisely their trajectories [1].

3. Study of the onset of deconﬁnement

The Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [2] predicts a 1st order phase transition
from the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) to a Hadron-Resonance Gas (HRG) [3] phase in
the energy range available at the SPS. According to SMES, at low collision energies,
only pure HRG is produced, at higher pure QGP state. The model also assumes
that in some collision energy region, the transition region, both states coexist forming
a mixed-phase.
In the transition region, constant temperature and pressure, as well
as an increase of the internal numbers of degrees of freedom, are expected. The phase
transition phenomenon should manifest itself in rapid changes in the energy dependence
of several hadron production properties.

3.1. Inverse slope parameter - “STEP”
One of the signatures of the 1st order phase transition, predicted by SMES due to the
presence of a mixed phase of HRG and QGP, is a plateau (step) in the energy dependence
of the so-called inverse slope parameter (T ). SMES assumes that the energy density
at the early stage of the collision increases with increasing collision energy, which leads
to a rise of the initial temperature and pressure. It also results in an increase of the
transverse expansion of the produced matter, visible in increasing values of the inverse
sNN < 7.62
slope parameter in the energy regions, in which a pure conﬁned phase (
GeV) or pure deconﬁned phase (
sNN > 11.03 GeV) is produced. In the mixed phase
sNN < 11.03 GeV) the ﬂattening of the inverse slope parameter
region (7.62 GeV <
energy dependence is expected due to approximately constant initial temperature and
pressure. The inverse slope parameter is sensitive to both the thermal and collective
motion in the transverse direction, hence an increase of the T value due to increase of
kinematic freeze-out temperature and/or collective eﬀects is expected, which is visible
while increasing the size of the colliding system. [2, 4]

The T parameter is obtained from parametrisation of the transverse mass (mT)
/ transverse momentum (pT) spectra of positively and negatively charged kaons. An
example of K+ pT spectra for Ar+Sc collisions for various beam momenta is presented
in Fig. 2. The kaon spectra parametrisation can be written as:

T 2 + T mK


 ,

where T stands for the inverse slope parameter, mK is kaon mass and S a normalisation
factor.

The “step” was originally observed by the NA49 experiment in Pb+Pb collisions for
mT spectra of K± [5]. Continuing this research, the NA61/SHINE observed qualitatively
similar energy dependence in p+p interactions and such behaviour seems to emerge also
in Be+Be reactions, as visible in Fig. 3. The values of the T parameter in Be+Be
collisions are slightly above those in p+p interactions. The T parameter in Ar+Sc
reactions is found between those in p+p/Be+Be and Pb+Pb collisions.

3.2. K+/π+ ratio - “HORN”

The other very important signature of the onset of deconﬁnement is the so-called “horn”.
It is expected for the energy dependence of the K+/π+ yields ratio which can be
interpreted as strangeness to entropy ratio. According to SMES predictions, K+/π+
steeply rises in the HRG phase, reaches the maximum at the onset of deconﬁnement,
decreases in the mixed-phase to an almost constant value in the QGP phase.

Rapid changes of the K+/π+ yields ratio at mid-rapidity and total K+/π+ yields
ratio as a function of collision energy were observed in Pb+Pb collisions by the NA49
experiment [5]. These two ratios, together with new NA61/SHINE results from Be+Be
and Ar+Sc collisions, are shown in Fig. 4. A plateau-like structure in the K+/π+ energy

dependence is visible in p+p interactions. The ratio K+/π+ at mid-rapidity as well as
the ratio of total yields from Be+Be collisions is close to the p+p measurements. For
Ar+Sc collisions the ratio K+/π+ at mid-rapidity and the ratio of total K+/π+ yields
are higher than in p+p collisions but show qualitatively similar energy dependence and
no horn structure is visible.

3.3. Proton puzzle

Rates of increase with collision energy of the K+/π+ ratio and T change sharply in p+p
interactions at SPS energies [6]. NA61/SHINE results along with available data from
RHIC, LHC, ISR and others, clearly show the breaking point (see Fig.4). To estimate
the break energy between a fast rise at low energies and a plateau (or slower increase)
at high energies, two straight lines were ﬁtted to the p+p data as shown in Fig. 5. The
low energy line was constrained by the threshold energy for kaon production. The ﬁtted
break energy is 8.3 ± 0.6 GeV, 7.70 ± 0.14 GeV, 6.5 ± 0.5 GeV and 7.9 ± 0.2 GeV,
for the K+/π+ , (cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) ratios and T (K−), T (K+), respectively. These values are
close to each other and surprisingly close to the energy of the beginning of the horn and
step structures in central Pb+Pb collisions , the transition energy being approximately
8 GeV (see Fig. 4). Figure 5 also shows that the sharpness of the break cannot be
reproduced by the resonance-string model (UrQMD) [7].

(bottom-right) mesons. The data are ﬁtted by two straight lines in order to locate a
position of the break in the energy dependence. The experimental results are compared
with predictions of the resonance-string model, UrQMD.

3.4. Flow

Directed ﬂow v1 was considered to be sensitive to the ﬁrst-order phase transition due
to strong softening of the Equation of State [8, 9, 10]. The expected eﬀect is a non-
monotonic behaviour (change from positive to negative and again to positive values)
of proton dv1/dy as a function of beam energy. This eﬀect is usually referred to as
the collapse of proton ﬂow and was measured by the NA49 experiment as anti-ﬂow of
protons in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at 40A GeV/c beam momentum (8.8 GeV) [11].
In 2018 the NA61/SHINE experiment reported the ﬁrst results on anisotropic ﬂow,
measured in centrality selected Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c beam momentum.
The NA61/SHINE large-acceptance spectrometer working in the ﬁxed target setup
allows particle tracking and identiﬁcation over a wide rapidity range. Moreover, the
NA61/SHINE forward calorimeter, the PSD, allows to determine the collision event
plane and therefore measurements of the ﬂow coeﬃcients relative to the spectator plane.

Preliminary results on the centrality dependence of dv1/dy at mid-rapidity, measured in
Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c, are presented in Fig. 6 (left). Plotted results show that
the slope of pion v1 is always negative, regardless of the electric charge of the particle.
In contrast, the slope of proton v1 changes sign with decreasing violence of the collision,
here for the centrality of the order of 50%. Proton directed ﬂow as function of rapidity
for Pb+Pb collisions at 13A GeV/c is presented in Fig. 6 (right). Measurement at
more energies are required to draw conclusions on the collapse of proton directed ﬂow
in Pb+Pb interactions [12].

4. Search for the critical point

One of the main goals of the NA61/SHINE experiment is to locate the critical point (2nd
order phase transition) of strongly interacting matter. The exact location of the critical
point (region) on the phase diagram is not known. It was estimated with various models
and lattice calculations[13]. The latest predictions suggest the critical endpoint location
in the µB − T phase diagram accessible to the studies at the SPS, and more speciﬁcally
for so-called critical temperature T CEP
< 135 − 140 MeV and critical baryon chemical
potential µCEP

> 300 MeV [14].

c

NA61/SHINE searches the critical point using such tools like scaled factorial
moments [15], central moments of multiplicity distributions of higher-order [16] as well
as intensive and strongly intensive measures [17] of particle multiplicity and kinematic
variables. Some of them will be discussed in this contribution.

4.1. Strongly-intensive quantities
The 2nd order of phase transition is expected to lead to enhanced ﬂuctuations of
multiplicity and transverse momentum. For their study NA61/SHINE uses strongly
intensive measures, for example Σ[PT, N] [18]. Within the Wounded Nucleon Model
(WNM), the strongly intensive quantities depend neither on the number of wounded
nucleons (W) nor on ﬂuctuations of W. Likewise, in the Grand Canonical Ensemble
they do not depend on volume and volume ﬂuctuations. The quantity Σ is deﬁned as
follows:

Σ[PT , N ] =

CΣ

(cid:105)
(cid:104)
(cid:104)N (cid:105)ωPT + (cid:104)PT (cid:105)ωN − 2((cid:104)PT N (cid:105) − (cid:104)PT (cid:105)(cid:104)N (cid:105))

,

(2)

where ω is the scaled variance of a given variable (e.g. ω[N ] = (cid:104)N 2(cid:105)−(cid:104)N (cid:105)2
). The quantity
is constructed in the way that it is equal to zero in the case of no ﬂuctuations and one
in the case of independent particle production.

The system size dependence of Σ[PT, N] at 150A/158A GeV/c from the
NA61/SHINE and NA49 [19] experiments within the NA49 acceptance as function of

Finally NA61/SHINE results for Σ[PT, N] obtained in the NA61/SHINE acceptance
for p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions are presented in Fig. 7 (right). So far, there is
no prominent structure observed which could be related to a critical point.

4.2. Intermittency

An intermittency signal in proton multiplicity was predicted close to the critical point.
The eﬀect is expected to manifest in local power-law ﬂuctuations of the baryon density
which can be searched for by studying the scaling behaviour of second factorial moments
F2(M ) with the cell size or, equivalently, with the number of cells in (px, py) space of
protons at mid-rapidity [15, 20, 21].

The transverse momentum phase-space is divided into M×M equal-sized bins,
and multiplicities quantify the proton distribution in individual momentum bins. The
second-order factorial moment in transverse momentum space is deﬁned as:

F2(M ) ≡

(cid:42)

1
M 2

M 2
(cid:80)
m=1

(cid:43)

nm(nm − 1)

(cid:43)2

(cid:80)
m=1

,

(3)

where M2 means the number of bins (M bins in px and M bins in py ), while nm is the
number of protons in the m-th bin.

However, subtraction of mixed events is needed in order to remove the non-critical

(trivial) background contribution of proton pairs, as following [22, 23]:

∆F2(M ) ≡ F data

(M ) − F mixed

(M ).

(4)

Then the second factorial moment, ∆F2(M ) should scale according to a power-law (for
M(cid:29)1):

∆F2(M ) ∼ (M 2)φ2.

(5)

In the recent analysis of NA61/SHINE, the intermittency eﬀects were studied in
central Be+Be and centrality selected Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c. Protons were
identiﬁed with a method based on dE/dx measurements and were selected with at least
90% purity. The collision centrality was determined from the energy deposited in the
PSD detector.

The NA61/SHINE results were compared with the most recently published
experimental results on proton intermittency obtained by NA49 in the same acceptance
and with use of the same analysis method. Figure 8 presents a comparison of the

law behaviour can be observed, and in Si+Si collisions by NA49 [23], in which the
intermittency eﬀect in proton multiplicity is clearly visible.

5. Summary and outlook

This contribution focuses on recent results from the NA61/SHINE strong interactions
program aiming to study the onset of deconﬁnement and search for the critical point of
strongly interacting matter.

Results on charged kaon spectra in Ar+Sc collisions at 19A–150A GeV/c were
presented. In particular, the inverse slope parameter of the transverse mass distribution
and the charged kaon to pion multiplicity ratio were discussed. The results on K+/π+
ratio in mid-rapidity and the ratio of total K+/π+ yields obtained for Ar+Sc collisions
are in-between results from p+p/Be+Be and Pb+Pb collisions, but qualitatively show
similar energy dependence to small systems and does not exhibit the signature, which
could be attributed to the onset of deconﬁnement (horn).

Results on energy dependence of K+/π+ ratio and the inverse slope parameter of
kaon pT spectra in inelastic p+p interactions were presented together with available
data from RHIC, LHC, ISR and others. The rates of these observables are rapidly
changing with the collision energy and clearly show the breaking point: 8.3 ± 0.6 GeV,
7.70 ± 0.14 GeV, 6.5 ± 0.5 GeV and 7.9 ± 0.2 GeV, for the K+/π+, (cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) ratios
and T (K−), T (K+), respectively. These values are surprisingly close to the energy of
the beginning of the horn and step structures in central Pb+Pb collisions-the transition
energy being approximately 8 GeV. The sharpness of the break cannot be reproduced
by the resonance-string model (UrQMD) and might be a hint of critical eﬀects (e.g.
onset of deconﬁnement) in inelastic p+p interactions.

Results on directed ﬂow of protons in semi-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at 13A
GeV/c and 30A GeV/c were presented. Still, results in broader energy range, 40A
and 150A GeV/c, are expected and needed to draw conclusions on the collapse of
proton directed ﬂow in Pb+Pb collisions. So far, no prominent structures, which can
be attributed to the onset of deconﬁnement, were observed by NA61/SHINE.

Current NA61/SHINE results on the search for CP via strongly intensive quantities,
obtained by varying number of wounded nucleons and collision energy, reveal no
prominent structure, which could be related to a critical point. Nevertheless, the
NA61/SHINE measurements show consistent trends in the Σ[PT, N] dependence on
the system size to the one obtained by NA49 experiment.

At the present moment, studies of midrapidity proton intermittency in central and
semi-central Ar+Sc collision, with enlarged statistics compared to previously reported
results, show no statistically signiﬁcant signal for the CP. NA61/SHINE continues the
analysis of data recorded within its scan in collision energy and nuclear mass number of
colliding nuclei. New analysis methods are being developed. Thus many more results
on the search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter are expected in the
years to come.

Currently, NA61/SHINE undergoes a signiﬁcant upgrade to prepare for the
extension of the scientiﬁc programme to open charm production measurements in
Pb+Pb collisions in the SPS energy range.
