Abstract. The TREX-DM experiment is conceived to look for low mass WIMPs by means of
a gas time projection chamber equipped with novel micromegas readout planes at the Canfranc
Underground Laboratory. The detector can hold 20 l of pressurized gas up to 10 bar, which
corresponds to 0.30 kg of Ar, or alternatively, 0.16 kg of Ne. The micromegas will be read with
a self-triggered acquisition, allowing for eﬀective thresholds below 0.4 keV (electron equivalent).
The preliminary background model, following a complete material screening program, points to
−1 in the region of interest, making TREX-DM
levels of the order of 1-10 counts keV
competitive. The status of the commissioning, description of the background model and the
corresponding WIMP sensitivity will be presented here.

1. Introduction
Looking for low mass WIMPs which could be pervading the galactic dark halo requires the
use of light elements as target and detectors with very low energy threshold and very low
radioactive background. Gas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) with micromegas planes have
excellent features to fulﬁll these requirements. TREX-DM (TPC for Rare Event eXperiments-
Dark Matter) [1, 2] is a micromegas-read High Pressure TPC for low mass WIMP searches using
Ar or Ne mixtures, not focused on directionality. The detector was built and operated at surface
in the University of Zaragoza as proof of concept. The experiment has been approved by the
Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain and is expected to be installed underground
by the end of 2017. The detector set-up and performance are described in section 2, while the
background model developed and the corresponding sensitivity for WIMP direct detection are
discussed in sections 3 and 4.

at 22.1 keV are shown.

2. Detector set-up and performance
Micromegas are consolidated readout structures; a micro-mesh is suspended over a pixelated
anode plane, forming a thin gap where charge ampliﬁcation takes place. Detectable signals in
the anode and the mesh are generated. Diﬀerent technologies have been built: bulk micromegas
have the readout plane and the mesh all in one and microbulk micromegas are in addition
more homogeneous and radiopure [3]. They oﬀer important advantages for rare event detection:
possibility of scaling-up, topological information to discriminate backgrounds from the expected
signal (just a few microns track for dark matter, giving a point-like event) and low intrinsic
radioactivity as they are made out of kapton and copper, potentially very clean. Indeed, after
a ﬁrst screening of micromegas readouts using a germanium detector in Canfranc [4], more
sensitive measurements using the BiPo-3 detector [5] and a germanium detector with larger
samples are available now. The activity of the lower part of the 238U and 232Th chains is below
0.1 µBq/cm2 [6]. An activity of (3.45±0.40) µBq/cm2 of 40K has been quantiﬁed, which seems
to be related to the production of holes by kapton etching using a potassium compound.

The TREX-DM detector, as built and operated at University of Zaragoza, is described in
detail in [1]. Two active volumes (19×25×25 cm3 each) are separated by a central cathode
made of mylar inside a copper pressure vessel. The ﬁeld cage, made of kapton and copper, is
covered by teﬂon. Two bulk micromegas readouts were installed at the anode planes. Signals
were extracted by ﬂat cables to the AFTER-based electronics. For the set-up at hall A of LSC,
the detector will be upgraded using new more radiopure connectors, microbulk micromegas and
an AGET-based DAQ system; a complete shielding consisting of 5 cm of copper, 20 cm of
low activity lead, 40 cm of neutron moderator is being installed and there will be a Rn-free
atmosphere inside shielding. Signals from 256×256 strips (∼1 mm pitch) will be digitized for
tracking and additional energy spectra are taken from the mesh. The microbulk micromegas of
TREX-DM are the largest area single microbulk readout ever produced so far, with an active
area of 25×25 cm2. After fabrication at CERN, they are being tested inside the TREX-DM
detector for the ﬁrst time (see ﬁgure 1).

First results from the commissioning phase of TREX-DM on surface were shown in [1]. More
recently, microbulk micromegas have been characterized in Ar+1%iC4H10 and Ne+2%iC4H10
mixtures at 1-10 bar using a 109Cd source. Energy resolution has shown some degradation with

 
 
c
pressure, being the FWHM at 10 bar 16(15)% for Ar(Ne) at 22.1 keV (see ﬁgure 2). An excellent
behavior has been registered for gain, with maximum values above 103(104) in Ar(Ne) for all
pressures, which is very important for achieving low energy thresholds. In principle, a very low
threshold is possible thanks to the intrinsic ampliﬁcation in gas. In practice, the readout area,
5 has
the sensor capacitance and the electronic noise set the threshold. A value of 0.45 keVee
been currently achieved in a CAST-like detector using AFTER electronics [7]. In the Zaragoza
set-up, the trigger was limited by the mesh channel noise level; therefore, trigger is going to be
obtained from low capacitance strips, using the AGET electronics. In this way, the TREX-DM
nominal (conservative) aim for eﬀective threshold is 100 eVee (400 eVee).

3. Background model
Ultra-low background conditions are a must in the direct detection of WIMPs. An exhaustive
material screening campaign underway for several years has allowed to design and construct
the detector and shielding according to the radiopurity speciﬁcations [1, 6, 8];
it is based
on germanium gamma spectrometry in Canfranc complemented by other techniques (GDMS,
ICPMS and BiPo-3 measurements). A preliminary background model of TREX-DM for
operation at LSC was presented in [1] and is being completed, including as inputs the material
activity from the screening program together with the measured ﬂuxes of environmental
backgrounds at LSC (gamma-rays, neutrons and muons). Simulations of the detector response
are based on Geant4 (for physical processes) and the custom-made REST code (for electron
generation in gas, diﬀusion eﬀects, charge ampliﬁcation at micromegas, signal generation and
analysis to select point-like events). A detailed geometry of the set-up including shielding has
been implemented (see ﬁgure 3) considering Ar and Ne mixtures at 10 bar.

Table 1 presents the background rates from 2 to 7 keVee

6 due to primordial or cosmogenic
activity in components inside or close to the vessel. The largest contribution comes from
the copper vessel, cosmogenically activated after being a few years at sea level; an activity
of (0.24±0.05) mBq/kg of 60Co was quantiﬁed in a dedicated germanium measurement and
included in the model. This important contribution could be suppressed by constructing a
new vessel. The measured 40K activity in the micromegas readout (see section 2) gives also a
signiﬁcant rate; new chemical treatments are being analyzed to reduce this activity. The use
of underground argon has been assumed, considering the 39Ar activity measured by DarkSide
[9]. The total expected background level is around 5(6) counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1 for Ar(Ne).
Table 2 shows the same background rates but from activity in components outside the vessel
and backgrounds at the laboratory. The eﬀect of radon-induced activity on copper surfaces has
been assessed, considering the deduced limit (<0.32 mBq/cm2 of 210Pb) from a direct germanium
measurement on exposed copper. The contribution from muons and environmental neutrons is
under control in the simulated conditions. All in all, the TREX-DM expected background is
between 1 and 10 counts keV−1 kg−1 d−1.

4. Sensitivity prospects
Figure 4 presents the attainable exclusion plots (90% C.L.) in the direct detection of WIMPs,
for both Ar and Ne-based gas mixtures at 10 bar, obtained assuming spin independent
(SI) interaction and standard values of the WIMP halo model and astrophysical parameters.
Three diﬀerent scenarios for ﬂat-shaped background, energy threshold and exposure have been
considered (see table 3). A data-taking campaign of approximately three years is foreseen,
starting with Ne with the option to change to depleted Ar. TREX-DM has a good potential to
be sensitive to low mass WIMPs beyond current bounds even at the scale of current detector.
