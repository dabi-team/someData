A full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface of spectroscopic quality is developed for the

van-der-Waals complex of a methane molecule and an argon atom. Variational vibrational states are

computed on this surface including all twelve (12) vibrational degrees of freedom of the methane-

argon complex using the GENIUSH computer program and the Smolyak sparse grid method.

The full-dimensional computations make it possible to study ﬁne details of the interaction and

distortion eﬀects and to make a direct assessment of the reduced-dimensionality models often used

in the quantum dynamics study of weakly-bound complexes. A 12-dimensional (12D) vibrational

computation including only a single harmonic oscillator basis function (9D) to describe the methane

fragment (for which we use the ground-state eﬀective structure as the reference structure) has a

0.40 cm−1 root-mean-square error (rms) with respect to the converged 12D bound-state excitation

energies, which is less than half of the rms of the 3D model set up with the

r
(cid:104)

0 methane structure.
(cid:105)

Allowing 10 basis functions for the methane fragment in a 12D computation, performs much better

than the 3D models by reducing the rms of the bound state vibrational energies to 0.07 cm−1.

The full-dimensional potential energy surface correctly describes the dissociation of the system,

which together with further development of the variational (ro)vibrational methodology opens the

route to the study of the role of dispersion forces on the excited methane vibrations and the energy

transfer from the intra- to the intermolecular vibrational modes.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular interactions play an important role in chemistry, biology, and materials science.

Through the many-body construction idea [1] of the potential energy surface (PES) of bulk-

phase systems the study of molecular interactions is translated to the study of molecular

dimers, trimers, and perhaps larger (but still small) clusters [2–10]. Small molecular clusters

can be studied to a great detail and precision by high-resolution spectroscopic and quantum

chemistry and quantum dynamics techniques. A good, ‘ﬁrst’ description of the quantum

dynamical features of molecular complexes is provided by the rigid-monomer approxima-

tion [11–14], which allows considerable savings both on the PES development and on the

quantum dynamics side. For accounting monomer-ﬂexibility eﬀects through the PES repre-

sentation, the application of eﬀective potential energy cuts (for each monomer vibrational

state) provides an improved representation over the rigid-monomer approach while retaining

the small number of active vibrational degrees of freedom [15].

At the same time, monomer ﬂexibility ‘eﬀects’ are, of course, non-negligible [16, 17], espe-

cially for (a) strongly interacting fragments (with strong monomer distortions) [18–20]; (b)

higher vibrational excitations; (c) monomer vibrational excitations that may correspond to

predissociative states of the complex [21, 22]; or (d) for symmetry reasons (i.e., degenerate

monomer excitations may show a non-trivial coupling with the intermolecular modes). A

full account of monomer ﬂexibility in complexes of polyatomic molecules represents a con-

siderable challenge for the current (ro)vibrational methodologies due to the large number of

vibrational degrees of freedom and the typically multi-well character of the potential energy

landscape.

A generally applicable, ‘black-box-type’ description of molecular systems with multiple-

large amplitude motions is truly challenging, due to (a) the high-dimensionality of the prob-

lem; (b) singularities in the kinetic energy operator in the dynamically important region

of the coordinate space, (c) a common lack of good zeroth-order models, (d) large basis

sets and integration grids necessary to converge the results, and thus (e) the necessity to

attenuate the curse of dimensionality. For semi-rigid molecules there have been eﬃcient

methods developed in the past [23] and further major progress has been achieved over the

last decade [24–32]. If there is only a single large-amplitude degree of freedom in the sys-

tem, the reaction-path-Hamiltonian [33] and similar approaches have been successfully used

3

together with semi-rigid techniques [34, 35]. There exist eﬃcient, tailor-made approaches

developed for particular systems, e.g., for molecular complexes [4, 36]. But a general and

eﬃcient solution method for systems with multiple large-amplitude motions remains to be

an open problem. For this reason molecular systems with multiple-large amplitude motions

represent a current frontier of research in quantum dynamics. The present work contributes

to this direction. The family of molecular complexes oﬀer a wide selection of systems with

a varying number of large- and small amplitude motions, varying coupling strengths, singu-

larity patterns, etc., and in this way, their study drives methodological developments.

In the present work we focus on the ﬂoppy, van-der-Waals complex of a methane molecule

and an argon atom (with twelve vibrational degrees of freedom), ultimately aiming to reach

the predissociative states which belong to the vibrational excitation of the methane fragment,

within a full-dimensional vibrational treatment. Due to the weak interactions governing

the internal dynamics of the CH4

Ar complex, powerful approximations could have been
·

introduced in reduced-dimensionality computations, including some methane vibrations, to

interpret the high-resolution predissociative spectrum of the complex [11, 37–39]. In spite

of this earlier experimental and quantum dynamics work (accounting for some methane

ﬂexibility) there is not any full-dimensional (12D) potential energy surface available for

this system. Hence, the ﬁrst part of this article is about the development of an ab initio,

near-spectroscopic quality, full-dimensional PES for CH4

Ar. The second part reports the
·

ﬁrst application of this PES in vibrational computations including all 12 vibrational degrees

of freedom using the GENIUSH–Smolyak procedure developed by two of us in Ref. [40].

Note that in Ref. [40], a (3D+9D) PES was used (only including kinetic couplings in the

Hamiltonian) in order to be able to test the developed vibrational methodology. In addition

to the development and the ﬁrst applications of a full-dimensional PES for CH4

Ar, we also
·

take the opportunity to test the rigid-monomer (here 3D) approximation(s), widely used in

the study of molecular complexes, with respect to the full-dimensional results.

II. PES DEVELOPMENT

A. Computational details

1. Benchmark dissociation energies

Geometries of the global (GM) and secondary minima (SM) of the CH4

Ar complex are
·

optimized using the explicitly-correlated coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative

triples electronic structure method, CCSD(T)-F12b [41], with the aug-cc-pVQZ correlation-

consistent basis set [42], followed by harmonic frequency computations at the same level

of theory. The resulting equilibrium structures have C3v point-group symmetry forming

three (GM) and one (SM) ‘H-bond(s)’—or, more precisely ‘H contacts’, which modulate

the dispersion interaction between Ar and CH4. To obtain benchmark dissociation energies

(De) for the GM and SM complexes single-point energy computations are performed at the

CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVQZ geometries: CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pV5Z, CCSD(T) [43] and

CCSDT(Q) [44] with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set to obtain post-(T) contributions, and both

all-electron (AE) and frozen-core (FC) CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pCVQZ-F12 [45] to determine

core-correlation corrections. The FC approach correlates the valence electrons only, whereas

in the AE computations the following electrons are also correlated: 1s2 for C and 2s22p6 for

Ar. All the ab initio computations are carried out with the Molpro program package [46],

except the CCSD(T) and CCSDT(Q) computations, which are performed using the MRCC

program [47] interfaced to Molpro. The ﬁnal benchmark De values are obtained as

De(CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pV5Z) + δ[CCSDT(Q)] + ∆core ,

2. Full-dimensional PES development

A full-dimensional analytic ab initio PES, named FullD-2019 PES, is developed based

on 15 995 energy points computed at the CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory at

geometries covering the conﬁguration space relevant for the interaction between methane

and argon. Note that previous test computations by one of us showed that the standard

augmented and F12 correlation-consistent basis sets provide similar accuracy for PES devel-

opments [48]. The geometries used for the PES development are generated by isotropically

positioning the Ar atom around the methane unit while atoms of the equilibrium CCSD(T)-

F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ methane structure are also randomly displaced. The C–Ar distance

is varied between 4 and 20 bohr, and the atoms of methane are displaced in Cartesian

coordinates within an interval of [0, 0.95] bohr. The PES is represented by a polynomial

expansion in Morse-like variables of the ri,j internuclear distances, yi,j = exp(

ri,j/a) with

−

a = 2.0 bohr, and using a compact polynomial basis that is explicitly invariant under per-

mutation of like atoms [49, 50]. The highest total polynomial order applied is 7. The total

number of the ﬁtting coeﬃcients is 9355. A weighted least-squares ﬁt is performed on the

energy points, where a certain energy E relative to the global minimum has a weight of

(E0/(E0 + E))

×

(E1/(E1 + E)) with E0 = 0.05 hartree and E1 = 0.5 hartree.

B. Results and discussion

1. Benchmark dissociation energies

In Table I, we present the benchmark dissociation energies corresponding to the global and

secondary minimum geometries of the CH4

Ar complex and compare them to the dissociation
·

energies determined on the newly developed analytic FullD-2019 PES. The correction terms

listed in Table I allow for estimating the accuracy of the benchmark dissociation energies.

The extremely fast basis set convergence of the explicitly-correlated CCSD(T)-F12b method,

which is manifested in the ∆5Z corrections of only 0.5 cm−1, ensures that the CCSD(T)-
F12b/aug-cc-pV5Z energy is basis-set-converged within about 0.1–0.2 cm−1. The correlation

of core electrons increases the dissociation energies by around 1.5 cm−1, and has an estimated

uncertainty of 1 cm−1. The δ[CCSDT(Q)] correlation contributions are also positive values of

around 2 cm−1 with a similar estimated uncertainty of 1 cm−1. (The uncertainty estimates

consider basis set eﬀects and post-(Q) contributions.) Relativistic eﬀects, not taken into

account in this work, are supposed to have smaller contribution than core correlation. Taken

together, the uncertainty of the ﬁnal benchmark dissociation energies is estimated to be

2 cm−1. The benchmark De values, as shown in Table I, are well reproduced on the new
±
PES with 0.3 cm−1 and 2.6 cm−1 diﬀerences in the case of the global and the secondary

minima, respectively. In the case of the global minimum the above agreement is even better

than expected due to cancellation of errors as it can be seen from the data of Table I.

2. Accuracy of the analytic PES

The newly developed full-dimensional analytic PES of the CH4

Ar complex, FullD-2019
·

PES features extremely low root mean square (rms) ﬁtting deviations, listed in Table II, with

7

rms values being lower than 1 cm−1 up to 55 000 cm−1 relative to the global minimum of the

PES. In accord with these low rms values the one-dimensional energy curves obtained on the

PES during the separation of the Ar atom from methane along the C3 axes of the global and

secondary minimum geometries, see Figure 1, show excellent agreement with the ab initio

energies. As also seen in Figure 1, the asymptotic behavior of the weakly-bound CH4

Ar
·

system is also well described by the PES. The asymptotic limits are reached at around

15 bohr from both minima.

It is worth emphasizing that the ﬁtted PES reproduces the

long-range asymptotic behavior of the high-level ab initio data without using any switching

function based on the traditional 1/R6 dispersion model. Figure 2 shows that the structural

parameters obtained at the minima of the PES agree well with the benchmark CCSD(T)-

F12b/aug-cc-pVQZ values. The C–Ar distances are reproduced on the FullD-2019 PES

with a diﬀerence of 0.003 bohr and 0.029 bohr for the global and the secondary minima,

respectively, whereas the C–H bond lengths and the H–C–H angles are practically the same

as in the benchmark geometry. Note that the geometry of CH4 is just slightly perturbed in

the minima relative to the free CH4 structure; the deformation energy at the global minimum
is only 0.05 cm−1. The outstanding accuracy of the FullD-2019 PES is also strengthened

by the dissociation energies corresponding to the global and secondary minima reproducing

the benchmark values within 3 cm−1 (Table I). The C–H separation is also scanned on the

PES and, as Figure 3 shows, FullD-2019 PES describes the C–H stretching motion well up

to 30 000 cm−1 relative to the global minimum. Furthermore, the potential scans (Figures

1 and 3) show that the PES function is smooth without any artiﬁcial oscillations proving

that the large number of ﬁtting parameters does not cause any overﬁtting problem.

C. Asymptotic behavior of the PES and comparison with limiting models

The FullD-2019 PES was ﬁtted to ab initio points using a permutationally invariant

polynomial expansion of Morse variables, yi,j = exp(

ri,j/a) (with a = 2 bohr), which are

−

exponential functions of distances for all atom-atom pairs [49].

In the present work, we

have included in the ﬁt polynomials of yi,j up to degree 7. The advantage of using Morse

variables over regular distances is that they ensure non-divergent dissociation asymptotes

for large ri,j values. At the same time, one might ask whether the exponentially fast decay

of the Morse coordinates allows us to have a correct description of the intermediate range

energetics, which, for the present system, is dominated by London dispersion forces, com-

monly described by a potential energy model, which has not an exponential but a 1/R6-type

limiting behavior.

The low rms values (Table II) indicate that the ﬁtting function used for the FullD-

2019 PES had suﬃcient ﬂexibility to reproduce excellently the ab initio energies, which, of

course, automatically capture all ‘interaction eﬀects’. To gain more insight in the short,

intermediate, and long-range behavior of the system along the dissociation coordinate, we

compare 1D cuts in Figure 4: the FullD-2019 PES, the Morse potential energy curve, and

the best ﬁt of the

−

σ/R6 model (with σ as a constant, ﬁtted parameter) over the R

∈

[7.5, 15.5] bohr intermediate range.

The Morse potential, c0y0

R + c1y1

R + c2y2

R is a second-order polynomial of the yR Morse

variable (deﬁned between the carbon and the argon atoms), and it reproduces excellently

the PES valley but it decays too fast to the asymptotic limit (Fig. 4). To reproduce well the

asymptotic fall, it is necessary to use a higher than second-order polynomial in the Morse

variable, and we found that a polynomial including monomials up to the 7th-order, i.e., up

to y7

R, in the ﬁtting function of the FullD-2019 PES provides an appropriate and automated

way to have an excellent overall (short-, intermediate-, and long-range) description of the

system.

It is worth pointing out that the diﬀerence in the intermediate-range behavior of the Morse

(too fast fall) and the PES ﬁt (fall similar to the 1/R6 dispersion model) is manifested

also in the vibrational structure (Figure 5). The full PES supports an additional bound

vibrational state and the highest energy wave function has a signiﬁcant amplitude over a

much broader range than the highest energy wave function corresponding to the Morse

to the data in the [7.5, 15.5] bohr interval. The RMS values of the FullD-2019 PES are 0.53 and

for the

σ/R6 ﬁts are 1.96 and 0.004 cm−1.

−

ﬁt. The signiﬁcant contribution of higher-order polynomials to the PES representation in

the long-range asymptotics is observed also in relation with using Morse tridiagonal basis

functions (Sec. III B) to solve the vibrational problem: while the low-energy vibrational

states can be converged with a small basis set, the highest-energy bound state requires an

excessive number of such functions indicating that there is an important deviation from the

too rapidly decaying Morse character.

Using the newly developed FullD-2019 PES, the bound vibrational states of the methane-

argon complex have been computed using the GENIUSH–Smolyak approach [40]. This

extension of the GENIUSH program [51, 52] makes it possible to discard basis functions as

well as points from the direct product basis and grid, using the Smolyak method [24, 25],

thereby attenuating the exponential growth of the computational cost with the vibrational

dimensionality. This development makes it possible to solve high-dimensional vibrational

problems, for which or for, at least, parts of which a good zeroth-order representation can

be constructed.

In the case of the CH4

Ar complex, a good zeroth-order approximation is obtained for the
·

methane fragment by using normal coordinates, (q1, q2, . . . , q9) and harmonic oscillator basis

functions. The relative motion of the fragments is described by spherical polar coordinates,

(R, cos θ, φ) similarly to Ref. [40].

The GENIUSH program requires the deﬁnition of the internal coordinates (and the body-

ﬁxed, BF frame) by specifying the Cartesian coordinates in the BF frame with respect

to the internal coordinates. The program uses this information to construct the kinetic

energy operator (KEO) terms in an automated fashion [51]. The usual Cartesian coordinates

expression of the (generalized) normal coordinates, qj

with i = 1(H), 2(H), 3(H), 4(H), 5(C) and α = 1(x), 2(y), 3(z). The liα,j linear combination
coeﬃcients and the cref

iα reference structure can be chosen by convenience (as a special case,

they can be obtained from the harmonic analysis of the PES at the equilibrium structure).

In the present work, we chose cref

iα to reproduce not the equilibrium structure (which could be

one of the minima of CH4

Ar or the isolated CH4 minimum), but to reproduce the tetrahedral

This choice accounts for anharmonicity eﬀects on the structure of the methane fragment al-

ready in the coordinate deﬁnition. (Note that here we used an eﬀective structure determined

in previous work [40] which reproduces the B0 value corresponding to the methane PES of

Ref. [53].) Using an eﬀective methane structure corresponding to the ground-state vibration

instead of the equilibrium structure for the reference structure of the generalized normal

coordinates, slightly speeds up the convergence of the vibrational energies with respect to

the methane basis. In the ‘complete basis’ limit, the precise reference structure becomes

irrelevant, of course.

The Cartesian coordinates of the argon atom are deﬁned with respect to the carbon atom

In the last step of the coordinate deﬁnition, the riα Cartesian structure, Eqs. (4)–(6), is

shifted to the center of mass of the methane-argon complex. Throughout this work, atomic

masses are used, m(H) = 1.007 825 032 23 u, m(C) = 12 u, and m(Ar) = 39.962 383 123 7 u

[54].

In the forthcoming subsections, we ﬁrst test cuts of the FullD-2019 PES in lower-

dimensional vibrational computations. We report the results of 9D computations carried

out for the methane fragment (with the argon atom ﬁxed at a large distance), as well

as, observations from 1D (R) and 2D (cos θ, φ) radial and angular model computations

15

are summarized. The experience gathered from these tests is combined to determine the

optimal parameters for the 12D computation, which is presented in the last subsection.

It is important to emphasize that in the ﬁnal computations we include all 12 vibrational

degrees of freedom in the variational vibrational treatment, but we chose the coordinates, in

particular, the reference structure of the generalized normal coordinate deﬁnition, so that

they provide an excellent description for the bound atom-molecule vibrations, which are

dominated by the methane zero-point state.

A.

Isolated methane vibrations

The energy levels of the methane molecule were computed on the FullD-2019 PES with

the argon atom ﬁxed at a 30 bohr distance from the center of mass of the CH4 fragment.
The atom-molecule interaction is (almost) negligible (less than 0.05 cm−1) at this separation.

For the variational computations, we started out from a direct-product basis set of harmonic

oscillator functions, φn1(q1) . . . φn9(q9) (ni = 0, 1, . . . , i = 1, . . . 9), which was pruned accord-

ing to the simple condition n1 + . . . + n9

≤

b. An integration grid (much) smaller than the

na¨ıve direct-product grid was deﬁned using the Smolyak scheme [24, 25]. In short, the grid

points were chosen to integrate exactly the matrix of the identity and also polynomials of

up to a maximum degree of 5 with the basis functions included in the pruned basis set [40].

The pruning parameter, the size of the basis, and the size of the Smolyak grid are listed in

Table III. The convergence rate with respect to the basis and grid size as well as benchmark

results for the vibrational energies of CH4 are shown in Table IV.

Using the b = 10 basis-pruning parameter, the energies are converged within 0.01 cm−1

up to (and including) the pentad of CH4. The 9690.62 cm−1 zero-point vibrational energy
(ZPVE) on the FullD-2019 PES is in good agreement with the 9691.56 cm−1 value corre-

sponding to the T8 force ﬁeld of Schwenke and Partridge [55]. The root-mean-square (rms)

deviation of the converged vibrational excitation energies with respect to their counterparts

deduced from experiments [56] is 2.88 cm−1, which is excellent given that this is a purely

ab initio PES, which was developed not speciﬁcally for an isolated methane molecule but

for the methane-argon complex. Note that these ‘isolated methane’ energies were obtained

using the FullD-2019 PES with the argon atom ﬁxed at a large distance from the methane

molecule.

d The number of points in the Smolyak grid corresponding to the selected H value.
e When using the FullD-2019 PES with b = 0 (b = 1), we observed that H = 11 (H = 12) is not
suﬃcient to recover the correct degeneracy of the methane vibrations (especially the E states
were aﬀected). So, in the end, we used H = 12 (H = 13) and NSmol = 871 (NSmol = 3481) for
b = 0 (b = 1).

Assessment of smaller basis sets (smaller b values) is important for planning the 12D

computations. The bound states of the CH4

Ar complex are dominated by the zero-point
·
state of methane, hence, b = 3 should be an excellent compromise for computing the in-

termolecular (atom-molecule) states accurately. The computation of predissociative states

corresponding to excited vibrational states of methane will require at least b = 6–7, which

assumes further development of the vibrational methodology.

Intermolecular radial representation

There are several possibilities to describe the vibrational motion along the methane-

argon distance. One can use

(α)
n

L

generalized Laguerre basis functions (with α = 2) [21,

57] or a Morse tridiagonal basis set. The Laguerre basis set may be a better choice for

computing predissociative states, whereas the Morse tridiagonal basis set oﬀers a more

compact alternative for bound states. In the present work, we used the Morse tridiagonal

basis set parameterized with the D = 150 cm−1, α = 0.65, and γ = 0.00033 values [18, 40,

58–60], which gave a good Morse ﬁt to the cut of the FullD-2019 PES at the equilibrium

(global minimum) structure of all other coordinates. Since CH4

Ar is an isotropic complex,
·

this radial basis is expected to perform well over the entire range of the angular coordinates.

The convergence tests suggest that 13 Morse functions with 15 quadrature points for R allow

us to converge the 3D(R, cos θ, φ) and 12D bound-state energies within 0.01 cm−1.

C.

Intermolecular angular representation

For the cos θ coordinate, we use sin-cot-DVR (DVR, discrete variable representation)

basis functions and points [61], while Fourier basis functions are used for the φ angle. Test

computations suggest that 23 sin-cot-DVR functions for cos θ and 21 Fourier functions with

24 quadrature points for φ will be suﬃcient to converge the 3D(R, cos θ, φ) and 12D vibra-

tional excitation energies better than 0.01 cm−1.

D. Full-dimensional (12D) vibrational states and comparison with 3D models

All vibrational bound states of the CH4

Ar complex on the newly developed FullD-2019
·

PES are listed in Table V. The intermolecular basis set corresponding to the (R, cos θ, φ)

coordinates is suﬃciently large to converge all vibrational excitation energies better than

0.01 cm−1. In order to ﬁnd the smallest necessary intramolecular methane basis set (char-

acterized with the b basis-pruning parameter), we have carried out 12D computations with

an increasing basis set size on the methane fragment corresponding to the b = 0, 1, 2, and 3

value. Concerning the ZPVE, we think that the b = 3 12D result is ca. 1

2 cm−1 larger (our

−

approach is nearly variational) than the exact result, similarly to the b = 3 ZPVE value of

isolated methane (Table IV). Concerning the intermolecular vibrational excitation energies,

19

we could eﬃciently rely on the cancellation of error in the relative vibrational energies, and

thus, a rather small methane basis set was suﬃcient to achieve the 0.01 cm−1 convergence

goal for the excitation energies.

It is interesting to consider the convergence of the excitation energies with respect to b.

The 12D computation with b = 0, which corresponds to a single(!) basis function on the

methane fragment, has an rms error of 0.40 cm−1. This rms value is ca. half of the rms

error of a well-converged 3D computation imposing rigorous geometrical constraints with

an

r
(cid:104)

0 methane structure (vide infra). A 12D computation with b = 1, which includes 10
(cid:105)
basis functions for the methane fragment, has an rms of 0.07 cm−1. Finally, our 0.01 cm−1

convergence goal is achieved for the b = 2 and b = 3 pruning parameter values.

Concerning the computational cost, the b = 0 and b = 1 computations took 10 and

20 hours (using 20 processor cores) and required 6 and 8 GB of memory, respectively. The

12D b = 3 (b = 2) computations took 42 (13) days on 50 (20) cores and required 80 (30) GB

of memory. As it was indicated already in the footnote to Table III, we had to use a larger

grid size for b = 0 and 1, than we had originally anticipated, which slightly increased the cost

of the computation. Furthermore, the condition number of the Hamiltonian matrix in the

current representation is very large (due to the application of sin-cot-DVR basis functions,

there are grid points which are very close to the singularities of the KEO), which implies an

increased number of Lanczos iteration steps. We anticipate reduction of the computational

cost with further developments.

Table V also shows the result of 3D, rigid-monomer computations, in which only the

R, cos θ, and φ degrees of freedom were treated as active coordinates. The ‘3D(
(cid:104)

r

0)’ col-
(cid:105)

umn corresponds to reduced-dimensionality results in which rigorous geometrical constraints

were imposed on the methane’s structure (referred to as ‘the reduction in the Lagrangian’

or ‘reduction in the g matrix’ in Ref. [51] and constructed automatically in GENIUSH). The

methane was ﬁxed at a regular tetrahedral structure with

rC–H
(cid:104)

0, which we calculated as
(cid:105)

the expectation value of the C–H distance using the isolated methane’s ground-state wave

function on the present PES. The vibrational excitation energies of this 3D model have a

relatively large, 0.93 cm−1, rms with respect to the converged 12D result. Furthermore, this

3D model (erroneously) predicts an additional, triply degenerate, bound state below the dis-

sociation asymptote, which can be explained by the slightly diﬀerent B0 value corresponding

20

to this model.

In the ‘3D(

0)’ column, we report the bound vibrational energies obtained with an

(cid:105)
‘adjusted’ 3D model. While using the

B
(cid:104)

rC–H
(cid:104)

0 value for deﬁning the 3D cut of the PES, we
(cid:105)

adjusted the C–H distance in the KEO to reproduce the

B

0 eﬀective rotational constant
(cid:105)

(cid:104)

of this PES in 2D coupled-rotor computations [13, 57]. This model reproduces the correct

number of bound states and has a smaller, 0.32 cm−1 rms, than the 3D model with the

rigorous geometrical constraints.

In relation with these 3D models, we conclude that a 12D computation performed with

B
a single 9D basis function for methane (b = 0) is on par with the 3D(
(cid:104)

0) model. If we
(cid:105)

allow only 10 functions for the methane fragment (b = 1) in the 12D computation, the 12D

result clearly outperforms the 3D excitation energies, without increasing the computational

cost dramatically.

In order to rationalize these numerical observations, we may distinguish between ‘static’

and ‘dynamical’ contributions from the methane’s vibrations on the atom-molecule energy

levels. The static contribution is due to the fact that the isolated molecule’s eﬀective (aver-

age) structure, due to anharmonicity of the methane’s vibrations, is diﬀerent from the equi-

librium structure. In 3D computations, this eﬀect is accounted for by ﬁxing the methane’s

structure at an eﬀective structure instead of the equilibrium structure. In 12D computa-

tions, we have ‘built in’ this static eﬀect in the coordinate deﬁnition (using generalized

normal coordinates) in order to speed up convergence with respect to the methane’s basis

size.

The dynamical contribution is due to the coupling of the methane’s vibrations with the

intermolecular dynamics. This dynamical coupling, which is often small but non-negligible,

requires a full-dimensional treatment. In the case of the methane-argon complex, we observe

that using only the ground and all singly excited (9D) harmonic oscillator functions capture

almost all dynamical eﬀects, but well-converged excitation energies assume at least 220 (9D)

harmonic oscillator functions, corresponding to the n1 + n2 + . . . + n9

3 pruning condition,

≤

for the methane fragment.

From a numerical point of view, it is necessary to mention that the 12D and 3D results

are close, within 1-2 cm−1, to the vibrational states reported in Ref. [11] (Table IV) on a 3D

PES developed using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory and an eﬀective (ro)vibrational

21

Hamiltonian some 20 years ago. The present work reports a fully ab initio quantum dynamics

study of the system in full dimensionality and its further extension to predissociative states

may reveal larger deviations from the eﬀectively designed approach of Refs. [11, 37]. There

are also experimental results in the predissociative range [38, 39], which will make the

comparison more interesting. Furthermore, the methodology recently developed and used

in the present work is not designed speciﬁcally for very weakly interacting atom-molecule

complexes, but it can be used for a greater variety of molecular systems and it ﬁts in

a series of recent eﬀorts made for a systematic development of general ‘black-box-type’

(ro)vibrational quasi-variational methods, applicable to molecular complexes or any other

molecular systems, of high vibrational dimensionality and with multiple large-amplitude

motions.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The present work reports the development of a full-dimensional, near-spectroscopic quality

ab initio potential energy surface for the van-der-Waals complex of the methane molecule

and an argon atom. The PES development is accompanied with the computation of all

vibrational bound states of this complex including all (12) vibrational degrees of freedom

in a near-variational treatment using the GENIUSH program and the Smolyak algorithm.

The vibrational excitation energies obtained within a 12D treatment were used to assess

traditional 3D (rigid-monomer) approaches. With further development of the quantum

dynamics methodology, full-dimensional computations will become more widespread and

applicable to ﬂoppy molecules or molecular complexes over a broad energy range.
