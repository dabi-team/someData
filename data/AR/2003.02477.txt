Gaseous  nanobubbles  (NBs),  with  their  unique  physicochemical  properties  and  promising  applications, 
have  become  an  important  research  topic.  Generation  of  monodispersed  bulk  NBs  with  specified  gas 
content remains a challenge.  We developed a simple method for generating bulk NBs, using porous alumina 
films with ordered straight nano-scaled holes. Different techniques, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis 
(NTA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), are used to confirm 
NB formation. The NTA data demonstrates that the minimum size of the NBs formed is less than 100 nm, 
which is  comparable to the  diameter of  nanoholes in the  porous alumina film. By  generating  NBs  with 
different gases, including CO2, O2, N2, Ar, and He, we discovered that the minimum size of NBs negatively 
correlated  with  the  solubility  of  encapsulated  gases  in  water.  Due  to  the  monodispersed  size  of  NBs 
generated from the highly ordered porous alumina, we determined that NB size is distributed discretely 
with a uniform increment factor of √2. To explain the observed characteristic size distribution of NBs, we 
propose a simple model in which two NBs of the same size are assumed to preferentially coalesce. This 
characteristic bubble size distribution is useful for elucidating the basic characteristics of nanobubbles, such 
as the long-term stability of NBs. This distribution can also be used to develop new applications of NBs, 
for example, nano-scaled reaction fields through bubble coalescence.

Introduction 

NBs are spherical bubbles with a diameter of less than 1 μm.  NBs have unique properties such as very long 
lifetime,1,2  and  high-density  surface  charge2-5  and  have  been  actively  investigated  in  many  varied 
applications, including water treatment,1,6 surface cleaning7-13 ultrasound contrast agents,14-17 and biological 
applications.14,18 Despite the great potential of NBs in various applications, the basic characteristics of NBs 

1

 
 
are not fully understood.  Various rationales have been proposed for the long-term stability of NBs, 18-20 
such as hard hydrogen bonds at the peripheral region (interface) of NBs,19,21 organic materials adhesion to 
the  surface  of  NBs,7  and  negative  charges  generation  at the  gas/liquid  interface  of NBs.5  However, the 
origin  of  NB  stability  still  is  not  completely  understood.    This  stability  question  remains  unanswered 
partially due  to  the fact  that  NBs  generated  by  different  methods  have  different sizes and  gas  contents, 
which lead to different properties. Bulk NBs can be generated by electrolysis, though the gas content is 
limited to oxygen or hydrogen.22 NBs can also be formed by sudden changes in temperature or pressure of 
gas-saturated solution, or by pushing gas though a porous glass membrane with random pore diameter.23-25 
However,  it  is  difficult  to  control  the  size  of  the  NBs  using  such  methods.  To  understand  the  basic 
characteristics  and  to  explore  new  applications  of  NBs,  a  simple  and  reliable  method  for  generating 
monodispersed NBs with any specified gas is needed.  

Here, we present a simple technique for generating monodispersed bulk NBs by applying gas pressure 
to a porous alumina thin film, as schematically shown in Figure 1.  A porous alumina film used as a gas 
filter is formed by anodization.  The film has straight, ordered, and densely packed nanoholes with an inner 
diameter of approximately 100 nm, as is shown in Figure S1(b).   Bulk NBs are formed when gas is pushed 
into  the  water  through  the  porous  alumina  nanoholes.    These  NBs  will  be  monodispersed  because  the 
nanohole size of the porous alumina thin film is relatively uniform.  Bulk NBs containing various kinds of 
gas, including rare gases, can be easily produced.  To confirm the NB formation by the new method, we 
used  nanoparticle  tracking  analysis  (NTA),  infrared  absorption  spectroscopy  in  the  multiple  internal 
reflection geometry (MIR-IRAS), and atomic force microscope (AFM).  We confirmed the generation of 
gas-filled NBs with a minimum size of less than 100 nm. The minimum NB size depends on the solubility 
of the encapsulated gases in water.  We also found that the size (radius) of NBs takes discrete values, and 
that those values obey a specific rule. We present a simple model to explain the observed size distribution 
of NBs.  In the model, we assume that bubbles of the same size preferentially coalesce.

by applying gas pressure to the porous alumina thin film with straight nanoholes in the film. 

Results and Discussion  

Confirmation of NB generation. Porous alumina films used as the NB generator in this study were formed 
by  anodization,  as  shown  in  Figure  S1.  Using  the  NB  generator,  we  prepared  a  NB  suspension  by 
introducing various gases into a 1-cc solution cell filled with deionized (DI)  water (or ethanol) at a gas 
pressure of 1.5 atmospheres for 1 h. After gas injection, the NB suspension was transferred to a sample cell 
in the NTA instrument. Under the microscope, the Brownian motion of nanobubbles was clearly visible 
due to light scattering (Movie S1).

Figure 2. Typical size distributions of CO2-containing NBs generated in H2O measured with NTA 
method. 

In Figure 2, we plot a typical size distribution of NBs prepared by injecting CO2 gas into water. Because 
NBs move randomly and collide with each other in the suspension, we often observed a size distribution 
profile with several different sizes, as shown in Figure S2. Distribution profiles in which the NB size is 
relatively  clearly  separated,  as  in  the  profile  in  Figure  2,  appeared  in  the  ratio  of  2  out  of  5  sequential 
measurements, as shown in Figure S2. The discrete size distribution will discuss in detail in the following 
sections. The NTA data indicates that the size of NBs is in the range of 50 to 200 nm, comparable to the 
diameter of the straight nanoholes of the porous alumina film used as the gas filter for bubble formation. 
Thus, we interpret that NBs were generated by passing CO2 gas through the ordered nanohole. As is shown 
in Figure S3, it was confirmed that CO2 NBs could be generated in ethanol using the proposed method, 
indicating that NBs can be generated in different kinds of liquid. 

To  provide  additional  evidence  for  the  formation  of  NBs  thought  the  nanoporous  alumina  film,  we 
carried out MIR-IRAS measurements to examine the CO2 NBs. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 
S4a. As CO2-NBs were released into DI water, chemical changes in the vicinity of the prism surface were 
monitored in-situ. As already demonstrated by Zhang et al., CO2 NBs attached to the prism surface are not 
stable.26-28 To stabilize the CO2-filled NBs in water, therefore, we dissolved a surfactant (sodium laureth 
sulfate)  in  DI  water  at  a  concentration  of  approximately  150  mg/L  before  releasing  CO2  gas  into  the 
water.29,30 Figure S4b plots a series of IRAS spectra measured while introducing CO2 gas into the surfactant-
containing  water  through  the  NB  generator.  We  clearly  identified  absorption  bands  for  gaseous  CO2,29 
indicating that CO2-filled NBs were created, and that those NBs gradually gathered in the vicinity of the Si 
prism  surface.  After  the  experiment,  we  then  collected  ex-situ  AFM  images  of  the  Si  prism  surface  in 
contact with surfactant-covered NBs. In Figure S4c, we show typical AFM images of the Si MIR  prism 
surface taken after removing the prism from the solution cell used for MIR-IRAS measurements. The image 
clearly shows the presence of a number of circular traces on the prism surface. The height of the circular 
traces is approximately 2 nm, which is comparable to the size of the surfactant used in this study.   The 
diameter of the circular traces is 50 to 100 nm.  This diameter is close to that of the NBs observed in the 

3

 
 
 
 
 
 
size distribution profiles of Figure 2. Accordingly, we determined that the observed traces originate from 
the NBs.  We  conclude  that  when  the NBs  on  the prism  surface  broke  immediately  after  the  prism  was 
removed  from  the  solution  cell,  the  surfactant  that  had  covered  the  CO2-containing  NBs  formed  the 
observed circular traces.

Size  distribution  of  NBs.  In  Figure  3,  we  plot  the  size  distribution  of  NBs  containing  different  gases. 
Comparing Figure 3 with Figure 2, we notice that the minimum bubble size of CO2 NB is smaller than NBs 
of other gases,  possibly due to the fact that the  solubility  of  CO2 is higher than  that  of other  gases. To 
confirm  the  correlation  between  the bubble  size and the solubility  of  the encapsulated  gas  in  water,  we 
investigated the relationship between the minimum bubble radius and the solubility of each gas. The results 
are shown in Figure 4.  Gases with higher solubility have smaller minimum NB radius. From this result, we 
conclude that when NBs emerge from the nanoholes of the porous alumina film, they have a size slightly 
larger than the diameter of the nanohole, and then shrink, releasing encapsulated gas into the water. The 
final NB size is determined by the balance between gas solubility and gas permeability of the NB interface. 
NBs containing CO2 gas, therefore, are smaller than those containing other gases.

Calculated size (Normalized)

Figure 5. Correlation between measured and calculated bubble sizes. The bubble sizes are extracted from 
the  NTA  data  (peak  position)  and  are  normalized  by  the  minimum  bubble  sizes  in  every  profile.  The 
normalized sizes are all plotted in logarithmic scale. 

In Figure 2 and Figure 3, the NB sizes fall into discrete groups. The size distributions of NBs seem to obey 
a specific rule. For instance, the smallest size of the NBs is approximately 50 nm, and the second smallest 
size is approximately 75 nm. The ratio of the two sizes is approximately 1.4, which is close to √2. The third 
minimum size is approximately 100 nm that is twice the minimum size. The ratio between adjacent size 
peaks is approximately √2. In order to examine whether such unique size distribution only holds for only 
CO2  NBs  or  it  is  applicable  to  NBs  containing  other  gases,  we  plot  correlation  between  measured  and 

5

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
calculated bubble sizes (normalized) in logarithmic scale in Figure 5. The result unambiguously shows that 
the size distributions of NBs obey the specific rule: size ratio between adjacent peaks is √2. And this unique 
size distribution was observed not only for CO2 gas but also for other kinds of gases.  This characteristic 
size distribution was identified regardless of the encapsulated gas of bulk NBs. 

Coalescence of NBs. As described above, the size of NBs takes discrete values, with an adjacent size ratio 
of about √2. A bubble has a spherical interface between the water and the encapsulated gas. The interfacial 
energy per unit area is given by the surface tension, γ. When a bubble shrinks, the interfacial area is reduced, 
leading to a change in the Gibbs free energy of the system. The change, ΔG, is 

∆𝐺 =  𝛾∆𝐴                                                                    (1) 

where  ΔA  is  the  change  in  interfacial  area.2  Similarly,  it  was  hypothesized  that  when  two  bubbles 
coalesce the overall interfacial area is reduced, and the energy of the system is reduced. If this is the case, 
it is likely that, when coalescing, two NBs fuse to produce a single larger NB. To determine the size of the 
NB formed by coalescence, we consider the case where two NBs with radii of r1 and r2 coalesce to generate 
a larger NB with a radius of rc.  We assume that NB follows the equation of state for an ideal gas, PV = 
nRT, where P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of moles of 
gas and R is a universal constant. It is well known that for NBs the pressure, P, is represented by the Laplace 
pressure given by 

𝑃 = 2𝛾 𝑟⁄                                                                      (2) 

where  r  is  the  radius  of  the bubble  and  P  describes the  increase  in  pressure  within  the  bubble  with 
respect to the immediate surroundings. This expression can be derived from a balance between the decrease 
in  surface  energy  when  a bubble  shrinks  and  the  increase  in  internal  pressure  due  to bubble shrinkage: 
σ∆𝐴 = 𝑝∆𝑉. We furthermore assume that a fixed mass of gas occupies a spherical NB. That is, when the 
two NBs coalesce,  𝑛(cid:2887) = 𝑛(cid:2869) + 𝑛(cid:2870), where n1 and n2 are the number of moles of gas of the initial two NBs 
and nC is that of the larger NB formed by coalescence. Thus, we can obtain the following relation for the 
radii of the NBs. 

(cid:2870) =   𝑟(cid:2869)
𝑟(cid:3004)

(cid:2870) +   𝑟(cid:2870)

(cid:2870).                                                                  (3) 

This  indicates  that the  overall  surface  area  is  conserved  upon  coalescence  of  two  bubbles,  which  is 
contrary to the previously suggested prediction that coalescence will reduce the surface area.2. When that 
two NBs before coalescence have the same radius, 𝑟(cid:3036) (= 𝑟(cid:2869) = 𝑟(cid:2870)) , we obtain 𝑟(cid:3030) =   √2𝑟(cid:3036). This is in good 
agreement with our observation that the ratio between adjacent NB sizes is approximately  √2. Therefore, 
we suggest that bubbles with the same radius coalesce easily.  The NBs created by the porous alumina filter 
have almost the same radius. As schematically shown in Figure 6, small bubbles of the same size coalesce 
to form larger bubbles, and the larger bubbles of the same size also coalesce to form even larger bubbles. 
Such chain coalescence is the origin of the characteristic size distribution profile we observed. 

To examine the process  of  nanobubble  coalescence, we look  further into our experimental setup.  In 
Figure S1a, the distance between adjacent nanoholes is several tens of nanometers.  NBs of the same size 
are formed because the size of the nanoholes is uniform.  Therefore, it is possible that NBs emitted from 
neighboring nanoholes coalesce almost as soon as they form, resulting in the observed size distribution. We 
measured the time evolution of NB size distribution.  Figure 7 shows the results obtained for the CO2 NB 
suspension stored in the solution cell of the NTA instrument for different durations. It is evident in Figure 
7a-c that, as time passes, NBs of larger sizes are generated, indicating that coalescence gradually proceeded 
after some time following NB formation. And even after 9 days, the bubble size distribution still obeys the 
√2 increment rule, as is shown in Figure 7d.

Why bubbles of the same size are likely to coalesce remains a question. Dahiya et al. reported that the 
driving force between two micro droplets is at a maximum when the two droplets have the same size.31 We 
suspect  that  the  NB  may  have  some  similarities  with  the  micro-droplet  system.  And  the  driving  force 
between  two  NBs  maximized  when  they  have  the  same  size.  Further  theoretical  and  experimental 
investigations are needed to elucidate the coalescing mechanism. 

Conclusions 

We have developed a simple method to form NBs, using a porous alumina film with straight nanoholes 
penetrating the film.  In order to confirm the NB formation by our method, we used nanoparticle tracking 
analysis (NTA), infrared absorption spectroscopy in the multiple internal reflection geometry (MIR-IRAS) 
and atomic force microscope (AFM). NTA data showed that the minimum size of generated NBs is less 
than 100 nm, which is comparable to the diameter of nanoholes in the porous alumina film.  We showed 
that the minimum size of NBs depends on the solubility of the encapsulated gases in water. We found that 
the size  (diameter) of  NBs is  discrete,  and that there is  a specific rule  which the bubble  size obeys. To 
explain the observed distribution of the bubble sizes, we proposed a simple model in which two NBs of the 
same  size  are  assumed  to  preferentially  coalescence.  We  hypothesized  that  the  repulsive  force  of  two 
colliding bubbles is smallest when the bubble diameters are the same, which would explain why bubbles of 
the same size preferentially coalesce. 

Experimental Methods 

Porous Alumina Film. Porous alumina films used as the gas filter in this study were formed by anodization.  
These films have many straight, ordered nano-scaled holes with an inner diameter of approximately 100 
nm. Figure S1a shows schematically the fabrication procedure initially described in our previous work.32 
The porous alumina films can withstand an applied pressure of approximately 2 standard atmospheres. A 
cleaned Al plate (thickness 0.3 mm, purity 99.999%) was electropolished at a constant voltage of 40 V in 
a mixture of perchloric acid and ethanol (1:4, v/v) at 0 °C for 4 min. Then the Al plate was anodized in 0.3 
M oxalic acid for 10 h at 0 °C and an applied voltage of 90 V. The remaining metallic Al on the bottom of 
the alumina film  was removed  by  etching in 36  wt % hydrochloric acid  containing  saturated copper(II) 
sulfate.  Finally, the bottom part of  the oxide layer (called the barrier layer)  was removed by dipping in 
phosphoric acid at room temperature for 1 h. This final treatment also widened the pore diameter.  In Figure 
S1b, we show typical SEM images (top and bottom views) of the porous alumina film we fabricated.  The 
porous alumina films have nanoholes with a diameter of below 100 nm.  Figure S1c is a photograph of the 
porous alumina film filter used for NB formation in this study. 

Nanoparticle tracking analysis. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has recently been widely used for 
nanoparticle analysis.33-35 NTA is a method used to analyze the nanoparticle movement by observing the 
Brownian motion of each nanoparticle using images taken with an optical microscope. Compared to the 
widely  used  dynamic  light  scattering  (DLS)  method,  NTA  allows  the  measurement  of  the  particle  size 
distribution with high resolution, especially in the range below 1 μm.  We measured the size distribution 
and  concentration  of  NBs  in  water  using  a  nanoparticle  characterization  system  equipped  with  a  blue 
polarized 405-nm laser (NanoSight LM10-HSBFT14, Quantum Design Japan). Particles detected by this 
technique range from 10 to 1000 nm in diameter.  The size of NBs, r, can be derived using the Stokes-
, where kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature,  is the viscosity 
Einstein equation;  𝐷(cid:2930) =  
of the liquid, and Dt is the diffusion coefficient. The value of Dt is obtained by analyzing the Brownian 
motion of nanoparticles using NTA. Measurements were carried out at approximately 25 oC in a small cell 
installed in the NTA equipment. The sampling time is 30 s unless indicated otherwise. Several different 
locations of the NB-samples were usually measured.

IRAS  measurement.  IRAS  detects  and  distinguishes  molecules  through  infrared  absorption  spectral 
profiles  of  the  molecules.  Previously,  we  have  shown  that  biomolecules  can  be  in-situ  detected  in  an 
aqueous solution using MIR-IRAS.36,37 In the MIR method, a focused infrared light beam passes through a 
Si prism, internally reflecting many  times, and molecular species can be monitored by  measuring  IRAS 
spectra of molecules in the vicinity of the prism surface where an evanescent field is present.38 In Figure 
S4a schematically depicts the MIR-IRAS experimental setup we used. We attached a Si MIR prism to a 
small solution cell with a NB generator.  NBs produced by the bubble generator were introduced into the 
solution cell filled with deionized (DI) water.  To confirm formation of gas-containing NBs, we monitored 
in-situ, real-time infrared spectral changes of the NB-containing water (NB suspension) in the vicinity of 
the  Si  prism  surface  where  an  evanescent  field  of  infrared  light  exists.    The  Si  prism  surface  was
