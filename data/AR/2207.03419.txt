INJECTIVES OVER LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS OF GRAPHS
SATISFYING CONDITION (AR)

GENE ABRAMS, FRANCESCA MANTESE, AND ALBERTO TONOLO

Abstract. Let K be any ﬁeld, and let E be a ﬁnite graph with the property that every
vertex in E is the base of at most one cycle (we say such a graph satisﬁes Condition (AR)).
We explicitly construct the injective envelope of each simple left module over the Leavitt
path algebra LK(E). The main idea girding our construction is that of a “formal power
series” extension of modules, thereby developing for all graphs satisfying Condition (AR)
the understanding of injective envelopes of simple modules over LK(E) achieved previously
for the simple modules over the Toeplitz algebra.

Keywords and phrases: Leavitt path algebra; injective envelope; formal power series

1. Introduction

In [4], the three authors presented a complete, explicit description of the injective envelope
of every simple left module over LK(T ), the “Toeplitz Leavitt path K-algebra” associated to
the “Toeplitz graph” T :=
/ • . Clearly T is an elementary but nontrivial example
of a graph that satisﬁes the following property.

•9

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let E be a ﬁnite graph. We say that E satisﬁes Condition (AR) in case
each vertex of E is the base of at most one cycle.

The condition that each vertex in a ﬁnite graph E is the base of at most one cycle has
been studied in other settings. For example, in [6] the four authors establish that, for any
ﬁeld K, this condition is equivalent to the Leavitt path algebra LK(E) having ﬁnite Gelfand-
Kirillov dimension. Subsequently, Ara and Rangaswamy1 in [7, Theorem 1.1] establish that
this condition is also equivalent to the property that all simple modules over LK(E) are of
a speciﬁed type (so-called Chen modules).

For us, Condition (AR) sits at a wonderfully fortunate conﬂuence of the ideas presented
in [6] and [7]. On one hand, similar to a process carried out in [6], the condition aﬀords the
possibility to consider a well-deﬁned positive integer representing the “length of a chain of
cycles”, and in particular aﬀords the possibility of applying an induction argument in such

a situation. On the other hand, as provided by [7], having a complete explicit description of
all the simple LK(E)-modules puts us in position to describe the injective envelopes of all
simple modules, and consequently to describe an injective cogenerator for LK(E)-Mod.

We show in the current article that the “formal power series” idea developed in [4, Section
6] in the context of the graph T can indeed be extended to all graphs satisfying Condition
(AR). In particular, we show that the injective envelopes of all the simple modules over
LK(E) may be realized as a type of formal power series extension. This is the heart of our
main result, Theorem 5.2.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review some of the basics of Leavitt
path algebras, and provide some properties of Leavitt path algebras of graphs having a
speciﬁed structure. In Section 3 we review the notion of a Chen simple LK(E)-module, as
well as that of a Prüfer LK(E)-module. In Section 4 we introduce the formal power series
construction associated to subsets of Path(E). With the Sections 3 and 4 material in hand,
in Section 5 we state and prove the main result of the article, Theorem 5.2. In addition, in
Section 5 we also provide two speciﬁc examples which we believe will help the reader better
understand and visualize Theorem 5.2.

We conclude this introductory section by giving a reformulation of the standard Baer

Criterion for injectivity, one which is well suited to our situation.

Proposition 1.2. Let L be an associative ring, and let M be a left L-module. Let I be a
ﬁxed left ideal of L. Assume that any morphism f : X → M from any left ideal X ≤ I
extends to a morphism ˆf : I → M, and also assume that any morphism g : Y → M from
any left ideal Y ≥ I extends to a morphism ˆg : L → M. Then M is injective.

Proof. Let J be any left ideal of L, and let h : J → M be an L-module morphism. The
restriction h0 : J ∩ I → M extends by assumption to ˆh0 : I → M. Setting

h1(j + i) = h(j) + ˆh0(i)
for each j ∈ J, i ∈ I yields a morphism h1 : J + I → M. That h1 is well-deﬁned follows from
this observation: j + i = j′ + i′ implies j − j′ = i′ − i ∈ J ∩ I, and hence

h(j) − h(j′) = h(j − j′) = h0(j − j′) = h0(i′ − i) = ˆh0(i′ − i) = ˆh0(i′) − ˆh0(i),
from which h(j) + ˆh0(i) = h(j′) + ˆh0(i′). Clearly h1 extends h. Now h1 : J + I → M extends
by assumption to ˆh1 : L → M. By the Baer Criterion we conclude that M is injective. (cid:3)

2. Leavitt path algebras

A (directed) graph E = (E0, E1, r, s) consists of two sets E0 and E1 together with maps
r, s : E1 → E0, the range and the source maps. The elements of E0 are called vertices,
those of E1 edges. E is ﬁnite in case both E0 and E1 are ﬁnite sets. Unless otherwise
indicated, we assume throughout that all graphs are ﬁnite. A sink w is a vertex
which emits no edges, i.e., s−1(w) = ∅; a source u is a vertex to which no edges arrive, i.e.,
r−1(u) = ∅. A ﬁnite path of length n is a sequence of edges ρ = e1e2 · · · en with r(ei) = s(ei+1)
for i = 1, 2, ..., n − 1. We denote s(ρ) = s(e1) and r(ρ) = r(en). Any vertex is viewed as a

(trivial) path of length 0. We denote by Path(E) the set of all ﬁnite paths in E. For each
e ∈ E1, we call e∗ the associated ghost edge; by deﬁnition, r(e∗) = s(e) and s(e∗) = r(e).
Given any ﬁeld K and (ﬁnite) graph E, the Leavitt path K-algebra LK(E) is the K-algebra
generated by a set {v : v ∈ E0} of orthogonal idempotents, together with a set of variables
{e, e∗ : e ∈ E1}, satisfying the following relations:

(1) for each e ∈ E1, s(e)e = e = er(e) and r(e)e∗ = e∗ = e∗s(e);

(2) for each pair e, f ∈ E1, e∗f =

(3) for each non-sink v ∈ E0, v =

and

The elements of LK(E) are K-linear combinations of paths λµ∗, λ, µ ∈ Path(E) [2, Lemma 1.2.12].
A nontrivial path e1e2 · · · en is a closed path (resp., a cycle 2) if r(en) = s(e1) (resp., and
s(ei) 6= s(ej) for every i 6= j). A cycle of length 1 is called a loop. A source cycle is a cycle
without entrances, i.e., a cycle c = e1 · · · en such that, for each e ∈ E1, r(e) ∈ c0 := {s(ei) :
i = 1, ..., n} implies e ∈ {e1, ..., en}.

P

Because E is assumed to be ﬁnite, LK(E) is a unital K-algebra, with multiplicative

of LK(E).

A subset H ⊆ E0 is hereditary if, whenever v ∈ H and there exists p ∈ Path(E) for which
s(p) = v and r(p) = w, then w ∈ H. An hereditary set of vertices is saturated if for any
non-sink v ∈ E0, r(s−1(v)) ⊆ H implies v ∈ H. Let P be any subset of Path(E). Let ℓ1,
ℓ2 ∈ LK(E) denote either a vertex of E or the sum of distinct vertices of E. We denote by
ℓ1Pℓ2 := {ℓ1pℓ2 : p ∈ P}
the set of all paths in P which start in a vertex summand of ℓ1 and end in a vertex summand
of ℓ2.

Additional general information about Leavitt path algebras may be found in [2].

For a hereditary saturated subset H of E0, EH denotes the restriction of E to H, that is,

the graph with E0

H = H and E1

H = {e ∈ E1 | s(e) ∈ H}.

Proposition 2.1. Let K be any ﬁeld. Let τ be a source loop in the graph E, with s(τ ) =
r(τ ) = t. Let H := E0 \ {t}, and let I be the two sided ideal of LK(E) generated by
ρ :=

u∈H u; that is, I = LK(E)ρLK(E). Then:

(1) The ideal I, when viewed as a K-algebra in its own right, is isomorphic to a Leavitt

P

path K-algebra. Further, I is Morita equivalent to LK(EH).

(2) There is a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of left LK(E)-ideals contained in I

and the lattice of left LK(EH)-submodules of ρI.

however, see Deﬁnition 3.1 below

4

GENE ABRAMS, FRANCESCA MANTESE, AND ALBERTO TONOLO

(3) Any left LK(E)-ideal properly containing I is a principal left ideal of LK(E). It is
generated by an element of the form p(τ ) ∈ LK(E), where p(x) ∈ K[x] has p(0) = 1.

Proof. 1.) Since τ is a source cycle, H is clearly hereditary. As τ is a loop based at t, H
is necessarily (vacuously) saturated as well. Invoking [2, Theorem 2.5.19] we get that I is
isomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra of a (not-necessarily ﬁnite) graph HE. (The graph HE
is a so-called “hedgehog graph".) Note then that I = LK(HE) need not have multiplicative
identity. However, I has local units when viewed as a ring (see e.g., [2, Section 1.2]). Since
ρ = ρ2, and I = LK(E)ρLK(E), clearly then I = IρI; as well, ρIρ = ρLK(E)ρ. Hence by
[1, Corollary 4.3] we have an equivalence

I-Mod

ρI⊗I −

Iρ⊗ρLK (E)ρ−

/ ρLK(E)ρ-Mod

between the category I-Mod of unitary I-modules (i.e., for each M in I-Mod, M = IM
holds) and the category of modules over the full corner ring ρLK(E)ρ. Since there are no
paths containing t that both start and end in H, the ring ρLK(E)ρ is isomorphic to the
Leavitt path algebra LK(EH).

2.) Let J be a left ideal of LK(E) contained in I. Since I has local units, we have IJ = J
and hence J belongs to I-Mod. Conversely, any left I-submodule M of I is a left LK(E)-ideal
contained in I, indeed

LK(E)M = LK(E)(IM) = (LK(E)I)M = IM = M.

Applying the equivalence described in point 1.), we get the indicated lattice isomorphism
between the left LK(E)-ideals contained in I and the left LK(EH )-submodules of ρI⊗I I ∼= ρI.

3.) Let J ′ be any left ideal of LK(E) properly containing I. We must prove that there

exists p(x) = 1 +

m

i=1 aixi ∈ K[x] for which

J ′ = LK(E)p(τ ) = LK(E)(1LK (E) + a1τ + · · · + amτ m).
P

By [2, Corollary 2.4.13], LK(E)/I ∼= LK(
) ∼= K[x, x−1]. Since 0 6= J ′/I is then a
(left) ideal of the principal ideal domain LK(E)/I, it is generated as an LK(E)/I-ideal by a
nonzero polynomial p(x) of degree m ≥ 0 with p(0) = 1 evaluated in τ + I. We consider the
following two elements of LK(E):

•t

τ

pt(τ ) := t + a1τ + · · · + amτ m

and

p(τ ) := 1LK (E) + a1τ + · · · + amτ m = ρ + pt(τ ).
We show that J ′ = LK(E)p(τ ). One can easily check that J ′ = LK(E)pt(τ ) + I, and clearly
J ′ contains pt(τ ) + ρ = p(τ ); since pt(τ ) = tp(τ ) we have

J ′ ≥ LK(E)p(τ ) ≥ LK(E)pt(τ ).
Since then J ′ ≤ LK(E)p(τ ) + I, to prove that J ′ = LK(E)p(τ ) we need to show that I is
contained in LK(E)p(τ ).

To do so, let s−1(t) = {τ, ε1, ..., εn} be the set of edges in E with source t = s(τ ). Any
element of I is a sum of the type αρ + βργs(τ ) with α, β, γ ∈ LK(E). Clearly αρ = αρp(τ )

The following result regarding expressions in LK(E) will be extremely useful in the sequel.

Lemma 2.2. Let E be a ﬁnite graph. Suppose that γ1, γ2 ∈ Path(E) have r(γ1) = r(γ2) = v
for some v ∈ E0. Suppose further that neither γ1 nor γ2 is of the form γδ, where δ is a
closed path having s(δ) = r(δ) = v. Then in LK(E),

otherwise.

Proof. If γ1 or γ2 are vertices, then the result is easy to check. So now assume γ1 = α1 · · · αh
and γ2 = β1 · · · βk, where h, k ≥ 1, and r(αh) = r(βk) = v. Then

Assume γ∗
1γ2 6= 0. If h < k we would have α1 = β1, ..., αh = βh; since r(αh) = r(βh) =
r(βk) = v, we get that the path βh+1 · · · βk would be a closed path with source and range

vertex v, contradicting the hypothesis on γ2. The situation in which h > k follows similarly.
(cid:3)
Therefore h = k and γ1 = γ2, and the result follows.

We close this section by noting some graph-theoretic properties related to Condition (AR).

Lemma 2.3. Let E be a ﬁnite graph. Then E satisﬁes Condition (AR) if and only if all
closed paths in E are powers of cycles.3

Proof. Clearly any graph in which the only closed paths are powers of cycles satisﬁes Con-
dition (AR).

Conversely, let e := e1 · · · en be a closed path in E. We proceed by induction on the
length n of e. If n = 1, then e is a loop and hence it is a cycle. Let n > 1. Assume that e
is not a power of a cycle. Consider the sequence of vertices (s(e1), ..., s(en)). Since e is not
a cycle, in the sequence there are repetitions. In the set

{(i, j) : i < j ∈ {1, ..., n}, s(ei) = s(ej), j − i minimal}

consider the pair (i, j) with i minimal. Then e1 · · · ei−1ej · · · en and ei · · · ej−1 are respectively
a closed path p and a cycle d in E of length < n. By the inductive hypothesis we have
p = cm for a suitable cycle c in E and m ≥ 1. The cycles c and d have in common the vertex
s(ei) = r(ei−1): therefore, by Condition (AR), c = d. By the minimality of i, we get i = 1
and hence

c = d = e1 · · · ej−1,

p = cm = ej · · · en.

Therefore e = cm+1, a power of the cycle c.

(cid:3)

The set of vertices of a graph E is naturally endowed with a preorder structure. Given

u, v ∈ E0, we write v ≤ u if there exists p ∈ Path(E) with s(p) = u and r(p) = v.

Writing u ≡ v if u ≤ v and v ≤ u, one obtains an equivalence relation ≡ on E0. The
≡. Because E0 is assumed to be

preorder ≤ induces a partial order on the quotient set E0
ﬁnite, E0

≡ contains maximal elements.

Remark 2.4. If the graph E satisﬁes Condition (AR), then (using Lemma 2.3) each equiv-
alence class in E0
≡ is either a single vertex, or the set of vertices of a cycle. In particular,
the maximal elements in E0
≡ are either source vertices or the set of vertices of a source cycle.
Therefore, if E in addition contains no source vertices, then the ﬁniteness of E together

with Condition (AR) implies that E contains at least one source cycle.

3. Chen simples and Prüfer modules

We reiterate here our standing assumption that E is a ﬁnite graph. So the Leavitt path

algebra LK(E) has a multiplicative identity, namely, 1LK (E) =

v∈E0 v.

In [8] Chen introduced classes of simple left modules over Leavitt path algebras. Here, we
concentrate on those simples associated to sinks or to cycles: LK(E)w (for any sink w) and

V[c∞] (for any cycle c) in E. We will see that, although these have been viewed as distinct
classes in the literature, they in fact share many properties.

A sink w is an idempotent in LK(E): we consider the left ideal LK(E)w. Since there are
no ghost edges ending in w, any element of LK(E)w is a K-linear combination of paths in
Path(E)w, i.e., of (real) paths ending in w. Since LK(E) =
u∈E0 LK(E)u as left LK(E)-
ideals, we have clearly

L
LK(E)w ∼= LK(E)/LK(E)(w − 1).

Given a cycle c = e1 · · · en in E, the “inﬁnite path" obtained by repeating c inﬁnitely many
times, denoted c∞, can be considered as an “idempotent-like element”: one has cn · c∞ = c∞
for each n ≥ 1. Extending the product deﬁned between elements of LK(E) and c, one can
in the expected way construct the left LK(E)-module LK(E)c∞, which is usually denoted
by V[c∞]. Since e∗c∞ = 0 for each e 6= e1, and e∗
1c∞ = e2 · · · enc∞, any element in LK(E)c∞
is a K-linear combination of paths in Path(E)c∞, i.e., of (real) paths ending in s(c) times
c∞. By [5, Theorem 2.8] we have

LK(E)c∞ ∼= LK(E)/LK(E)(c − 1).

If one thinks of a sink w as a cycle of length 0, and observes that w∞ = w, the two above

constructions of simple modules may be viewed as two manifestations of the same idea.

Deﬁnition 3.1. By a cycle in the graph E we mean either a sink (i.e., a cycle of length 0),
or a proper cycle, i.e., a cycle of length n ≥ 1. We unify notation by setting

for any sink w in E.

V[w∞] := LK(E)w

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let E be a ﬁnite graph, and c any cycle in E. By P E
subset of Path(E):

c we denote the following

.

Remark 3.3. By Lemma 2.3, if the graph E satisﬁes Condition (AR), then for any cycle c
the paths in P E

c do not end with the traverse of any closed path.

Remark 3.4. It follows by [8, §3.1] and [2, Corollary 1.5.15] that for any cycle c, the set
c · c∞ = {p · c∞ : p ∈ P E
c }

P E

is a K-base for the simple left LK(E)-module V[c∞].

If c is any cycle and 0 6= a ∈ K, we denote by σc,a the “gauge” automorphism of LK(E)
associated to c and a. This automorphism is deﬁned to be the identity if c is a sink.
Otherwise, if c = e1e2 · · · en is a proper cycle, σc,a sends u to u for each u ∈ E0, e to e and
e∗ to e∗ for each e ∈ E1 \ {e1}, and e1 to ae1 and e∗
1. If a = 1, then σc,1 is clearly
the identity automorphism of LK(E).

1 to a−1e∗

For M in LK(E)-Mod, we deﬁne M σc,a ∈ LK(E)-Mod by setting M σc,a = M as an abelian

group, but with the modiﬁed left LK(E)-action

ℓ ⋆ m := σc,a(ℓ)m

for each ℓ ∈ LK(E) and m ∈ M. The automorphism σc,a induces an auto-equivalence of the
category LK(E)-Mod given by the functor

LK(E)σc,a ⊗LK (E) − : LK(E)-Mod → LK(E)-Mod
which sends any LK(E)-module M to the “twisted” LK(E)-module M σc,a ∼= LK(E)σc,a ⊗ M.
The twisted module V σc,a

[c∞] is a simple left LK(E)-module for each 0 6= a ∈ K.

A family of simple LK(E)-modules wider than the one presented in [8] for proper cycles
was obtained by Ara and Rangaswamy in [7] as follows. Let K be any ﬁeld, c be any cycle
in E, and f (x) ∈ K[x] be a basic irreducible polynomial in K[x], i.e., a polynomial which is
irreducible in K[x], and for which f (0) = −1. Denote by K ′ the ﬁeld K[x]/hf (x)i and by x
the element x + hf (x)i ∈ K ′.

Deﬁnition 3.5. We denote by V f
LK ′(E)-module V σc,x

E,[c∞] by restricting scalars from K ′ to K.

E,[c∞] the left LK(E)-module obtained from the twisted left

Here is a more precise formulation of V f

E,[c∞]. The K-algebra homomorphism K → K ′
induces a functor U from LK ′(E)-modules to LK(E)-modules which is the right adjoint of
the extension of scalars functor − ⊗K K ′ : LK(E)-Mod → LK ′(E)-Mod. Then V f
E,[c∞] is
deﬁned to be U(V σc,x

E,[c∞]).

In particular, for each 0 6= a ∈ K we may view the previously deﬁned twisted modules in

these more general terms by noting that

V σc,a
E,[c∞] = V f

E,[c∞] where f (x) = a−1x − 1.

We will often omit the graph E when it is clear from the context, writing simply V f
c = w is a sink, then

[c∞]. If

V f
[w∞] = LK(E)w = KP E
for any basic irreducible polynomial f (x) ∈ K[x].

Remark 3.6. Since any element of K ′ is a K-linear combination of elements of the form
xh (0 ≤ h < deg(f (x))), by Remark 3.4 for any cycle c, the set

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let c be any sink and f (x) any basic irreducible polynomial in K[x]. Fol-
lowing Ara and Rangaswamy [7], we call any simple left LK(E)-module of the form V f
[c∞] a
Chen simple module.

Remark 3.8. If c1 is a cycle of length ≥ 2 obtained by “rotating” the cycle c2, then the
simple modules V f
E,[c∞] = VE,[c∞],
for any basic irreducible polynomial f (x) ∈ K[x]. Aside from these cases, the Chen simple
modules are pairwise non-isomorphic. (See [8, Theorem 6.2] and [7, Proposition 3.8].)

In addition to the Chen simple modules, there is another important (and related) con-
struction of LK(E)-modules which will be relevant in the sequel. Let E be a ﬁnite graph,
and c any cycle in E. In [3] the three authors constructed the Prüfer LK(E)-module UE,c−1
associated to any proper cycle c in E. The module UE,c−1 is an inﬁnite length uniserial
artinian LK(E)-module with all composition factors isomorphic to V[c∞]. The module UE,c−1
is the direct limit

UE,c−1 := lim
−→
i,j≥1

{LK(E)/LK(E)(c − 1)i, ψE,i,j}

of the factor modules LK(E)/LK(E)(c − 1)i, with respect to the morphisms

ψE,i,j : LK(E)/LK(E)(c − 1)i → LK(E)/LK(E)(c − 1)j, deﬁned by setting

1 + LK(E)(c − 1)i

7→

(c − 1)j
(c − 1)i + LK(E)(c − 1)j ∀1 ≤ i < j.

Denoting by

ψE,i : LK(E)/LK(E)(c − 1)i → UE,c−1
for each i ≥ 1 the induced monomorphism, the Prüfer module UE,c−1 is generated as an
LK(E)-module by the elements

αc,i := ψE,i(1 + LK(E)(c − 1)i),

i ≥ 1.

If c = w is a sink, then αw,i = (−1)i+1αw,1. The Prüfer module corresponding to a sink then
becomes

UE,w−1 = V[w∞] = LK(E)w = KP E
w .

Clearly, for any cycle c, LK(E)αc,1 is isomorphic to the simple module V[c∞], and hence
it is the socle of the module UE,c−1 (it is equal to V[c∞] if c is a sink). In particular V[c∞] is
essential in UE,c−1. In general we omit reference to the graph E and write simply Uc−1.

We now provide some additional information about the Prüfer LK(E)-module Uc−1 for

any cycle c of E. Let m ≥ 1. Setting αc,0 = 0, we have

(c − 1)αc,m =

0
αc,m−1

(

if c is a sink,
if c is a proper cycle.

If u ∈ E0 \ {s(c)}, then easily one shows that u = (−1)mu(c − 1)m for each m ≥ 1, so we

get uαc,m = 0. (As a result, s(c)αc,m = αc,m.)

10

GENE ABRAMS, FRANCESCA MANTESE, AND ALBERTO TONOLO

If c has length 0 and e ∈ E1, or c is a proper cycle and e ∈ E1 \ {e1}, it is also easily
shown that e∗ = (−1)me∗(c − 1)m for each m ≥ 1. So e∗αc,m = 0 for all m ≥ 1 in this
situation as well.

Finally, if c is a proper cycle c = e1e2 · · · en, then for each m ≥ 1, multiplying each side
1αc,m =
1αc,m−1. (We interpret e2 · · · en as t = s(c) if n = 1.) Continuing in this way,

that the LK(E)-coeﬃcients do not involve any ghost edges. This observation will play a key
role later on.

Analogous to the construction of the simple module V f

[c∞] associated to any proper cycle

c and any basic irreducible f (x) ∈ K[x], we have

Deﬁnition 3.9. Let E be any ﬁnite graph, and K any ﬁeld. Let c be any cycle, f (x) be any
basic irreducible polynomial in K[x], and x := x + hf (x)i ∈ K ′ = K[x]/hf (x)i. We deﬁne

Observe that if c = w is a sink, then Deﬁnition 3.9 reduces to

Remark 3.10. Since for each 0 6= a ∈ K, any automorphism of LK(E) induces an au-

LK(E)-module U σc,a
E,c−1 is an
inﬁnite length uniserial artinian left LK(E)-module with composition factors isomorphic to

As mentioned previously, the cases of simple LK(E)-modules corresponding to sinks and
those corresponding to proper cycles have historically been treated separately in the litera-
ture. We believe that there is enough commonality to these two types of simples that merits
treating them as two cases of the same construction. Admittedly, however, there is a small
price of additional notation to pay in order to achieve this single approach. We set

As expected, the wider class of modules Uf (c) satisfy properties similar to the speciﬁc

modules Uc−1.

Proposition 3.13. Let E be a ﬁnite graph, K any ﬁeld, c a proper cycle in E, and f (x) a
basic irreducible polynomial in K[x]. The LK(E)-module Uf (c) is an inﬁnite length uniserial
artinian module with all composition factors isomorphic to V f

[c∞].

Proof. As sets, we have Uf (c) = Ug(x)c−1. It is suﬃcient to prove that the lattice of LK(E)-
submodules of Uf (c) is equal to the lattice of LK ′(E)-submodules of Ug(x)c−1. Clearly any
LK ′(E)-submodule of Ug(x)c−1 is also a LK(E)-submodule of Uf (c). Consider now an LK(E)-
submodule M of Uf (c). Since, as observed in Remark 3.10,

Corollary 1.5.15].

5. The main result

The aim of this paper is to explicitly construct the injective envelope of all simple modules
over any Leavitt path algebra LK(E) associated to a ﬁnite graph E satisfying Condition
(AR). A ﬁrst important step has already been established. Using a number of powerful tools
(e.g., pure injectivity, and the Bézout property of Leavitt path algebras), the three authors
proved the following.

Theorem 5.1. [3, Theorem 6.4] Let E be any ﬁnite graph, and let c be a proper cycle in E.
Then the Prüfer module UE,c−1 is injective if and only if c is a maximal cycle (i.e., there are
no cycles in E other than cyclic shifts of c which connect to s(c)).

With Theorem 5.1 and the results established in the previous sections in hand, we are

now in position to state the main theorem of the article.

Theorem 5.2. Let K be any ﬁeld, and let E be any ﬁnite graph satisfying Condition (AR).
Let c be a cycle in E, and let f (x) ∈ K[x] be a basic irreducible polynomial in K[x]. Then
the injective envelope of V f
In particular, if c = w is a sink, then the injective envelope of V[w∞] = LK(E)w is the left

Observe that for a proper cycle c, P E

is ﬁnite if and only if c is a maximal cycle. In such
Uf (c). Thus Theorem 5.2 may be viewed as a signiﬁcant extension
a situation we get Uf (c) =
of Theorem 5.1 for graphs satisfying Condition (AR), as it provides the injective envelopes
of simples associated to all sinks, and to all cycles (not only the maximal ones) together with
appropriate irreducible polynomials of K[x].

b

Remark 5.3. As mentioned in the Introduction, by [7, Theorem 1.1], when E satisﬁes Con-
dition (AR) then the Chen simple modules represent all the simple LK(E)-modules. So, once
the proof of Theorem 5.2 is completed, we will get as a consequence an explicit description of
an injective cogenerator for LK(E)-Mod, namely, the direct product of the injective envelopes
of all the simple modules.

Prior to executing the proof of Theorem 5.2, we provide the following speciﬁc example in

order to clarify some of the germane ideas.

Ux−1c−1 by applying the functor U which
that
restricts the scalars from K ′ to K.
Then, to prove the injectivity of

Uc−1, for any cycle c in E, we reduce ﬁrst to connected
graphs, then reduce to graphs which contain no source vertices, and ﬁnally reduce to graphs
in which every source cycle is a loop.

Uf (c) is obtained from the left LK ′(E)-module

After these four reductions, the core of the proof is based on an induction argument on

the number of cycles in the graph E. It is here that the main ideas come to light.

Proposition 5.5. Let c be a proper cycle in E and f (x) ∈ K[x] a basic irreducible polyno-
mial. Denote by K ′ the ﬁeld K[x]/hf (x)i. If
Uc−1 is an injective left LK ′(E)-module, then
Uf (c) is an injective left LK(E)-module.

Proof. Given 0 6= a ∈ K, we ﬁrst consider the case f (x) = a−1x − 1.

The next three lemmas will permit us to reduce our study to connected graphs having no

source vertices and in which the source cycles are loops.

Lemma 5.6. Let E be a ﬁnite graph and Ei, i = 1, 2, ..., m, its connected components. The
Leavitt path algebra associated to E decomposes as the direct sum of two-sided ideals, each
of which is the Leavitt path algebra associated to a connected component of E:

The reduction to graphs having no source vertices and in which the source cycles are
loops will be achieved using relatively standard equivalence functors between categories of
modules over Leavitt path algebras associated to general graphs, and categories of modules
over Leavitt path algebras associated to graphs having no source vertices and all source
cycles being loops. Of course such equivalences will preserve various homological properties,
including injectivity.

However, we need more. The modules

UE,c−1 are built in a speciﬁc way from the data
corresponding to the graph E and cycle c. So if, for example, F is a subgraph of E (or F is
otherwise built from E) which contains the cycle c, and if T : LK(F )-Mod → LK(E)-Mod
UF,c−1 has been shown to be injective as an LK(F )-
is an equivalence of categories, and if
module, then certainly T (
UF,c−1) is an injective LK(E)-module. But it is not at all immediate
from purely categorical considerations that

T (

Fortunately, the displayed isomorphism does indeed hold for each of the equivalence functors

Lemma 5.7. Let E be a ﬁnite graph satisfying Condition (AR), and u a source vertex in

Morita equivalence

Assume now that E contains a source cycle d = d1 · · · dr which is not a loop. By [7,
Lemma 4.4] a ﬁnite graph FE,d can be constructed from E in which the cycle d (and all
its vertices) is replaced by a loop in such a way that LK(E) and LK(FE,d) are Morita
equivalent. More precisely, let d0 denote the set of vertices {s(d1), . . . , s(dr)}, and deﬁne
E,d = {v} ∪ (E0 \ d0) where v is a new vertex. Then to deﬁne F 1
F 0
FE,d(u) =
s−1
E (u) for each u ∈ E0 \ d0; for each edge f with s(f ) ∈ d0 and r(f ) ∈ E0 \ d0, deﬁne an
edge ϕ(f ) with sFE,d(ϕ(f )) = v and rFE,d(ϕ(f )) = rE(f ). Finally, we deﬁne a loop d′ at v so
that sFE,d(d′) = v = rFE,d(d′). Observe that that there are no edges connecting any pair of
vertices in d0 other than the edges d1, ..., dr.

E,d, we ﬁrst set s−1

Lemma 5.8. Let d = d1 · · · dr be a source cycle in the graph E with r ≥ 2. Let FE,d be the
graph described in the previous paragraph, in which d is replaced by the loop d′. Then there
are inverse equivalence functors

Moreover,

UE,c−1

for any cycle c in E.

Proof. We describe how the functors G1 and G2 work. (The details are given in [7, Lemma
4.4].) Consider the map θ : LK(FE,d) → LK(E) deﬁned on vertices by:

b

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

θ(u) = u for u ∈ F 0

E,d \ {v};

θ(v) = sE(d);

and deﬁned on edges by:

θ(e) = e for e having sFE,d(e) ∈ F 0
θ(ϕ(f )) = d1 · · · di−1f for f having sE(f ) = s(di) and rE(f ) ∈ E0 \ d0;
θ(d′) = d = d1 · · · dr.

E,d \ {v};

By [7, Lemma 4.4] the map θ extends to a well-deﬁned K-algebra isomorphism

θ : LK(FE,d) → ωLK(E)ω,

ˆθ : LK(FE,d)-Mod → ωLK(E)ω-Mod.
The ring ωLK(E)ω is easily seen to be a full corner of LK(E) and so is Morita equivalent to
LK(E). The functors G1 and G2 which realise the Morita equivalence between LK(E)-Mod
and LK(FE,d)-Mod are given by the following compositions

In the following example we clarify in a concrete situation how the isomorphisms described

in Lemma 5.8 work.

{d2, ǫ}. Let d0 denote the vertices {s(d1), s(d2), s(d3)}, and denote by ω the idempotent

Proof of Theorem 5.2. Recall that we consider any sink w ∈ E0 as a cycle of length 0.

The essentiality of V f

demonstrate that
f (x) ∈ K[x].

b

[c∞] in

Uf (c) has been shown in Proposition 4.4. So we need only
Uf (c) is injective for each cycle c and each basic irreducible polynomial

b

Given any cycle c, by Lemma 5.6 we can establish the injectivity of

Uf (c) in the Leavitt
path algebra associated to the connected component containing c. By Lemmas 5.7 and 5.8,
we can assume that the connected component containing c has no source vertices, and that
all its source cycles are source loops. Moreover by Proposition 5.5, it suﬃces to show the
result in the case f (x) = x − 1, and hence we may assume

Uf (c) =

Uc−1.

b

We proceed by induction on the number N of cycles in the connected component of E

containing the cycle c. We continue to call this connected component E.

b

b

If N = 0, then by the reduction assumptions the graph E has one vertex and no edges.

So LK(E) ∼= K, and therefore all left LK(E)-modules are injective.

If E consists of one vertex u and one loop at u, then by Theorem 5.1 we conclude that

Uc−1 =

Uc−1 is injective.

b

Otherwise, invoking Remark 2.4, the graph E contains at least one source loop τ and two
UE,τ −1
vertices. Since τ is a maximal cycle, by Theorem 5.1 the Prüfer module UE,τ −1 =
is injective. Denote s(τ ) by t. Denote by I the two sided ideal of LK(E) generated by the
hereditary set of vertices H = E0 \ {t}, and by ρ the idempotent

u∈H u= 1LK (E) − t.
b

By Proposition 2.1, I is isomorphic to a Leavitt path algebra, and there is an equivalence
between the category I-Mod of (unitary) I-modules and the category ρLK(E)ρ-Mod= ρIρ-
Mod, induced by the functors

P

ρI ⊗I − : I-Mod → ρLK(E)ρ-Mod

and

Iρ ⊗ρLK (E)ρ − : ρLK (E)ρ-Mod → I-Mod.

Moreover, the K-algebra ρLK(E)ρ is isomorphic to the Leavitt path K-algebra LK(EH ).

Now let c be any cycle in E, c 6= τ . Then c lives also in EH . Since each of the connected
components of the graph EH (there might be more than one such component) has fewer
cycles than does E, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to conclude that
UEH ,c−1 is an
injective LK(EH )-module.

We prove that

UE,c−1 is injective in LK(E)-Mod. To do so we use the version of Baer’s

b

Criterion presented in Lemma 1.2, with respect to the ideal I.

So ﬁrst, let J be a left ideal of LK(E) contained in I. Since I has local units, we have

IJ = J and hence J belongs to I-Mod. Consider an arbitrary LK(E)-homomorphism

Since IJ = J, ϕ factors through

ϕ : J →

ϕ : J → I

We show that it is possible to extend ϕ to I. Clearly I

UE,c−1 is also a left I-module and ϕ

It is easy to check that ριτ xεy 6= 0 if and only if ι = ι′ρε∗

Moreover, the I-linear map ψ is in fact LK(E)-linear. Indeed, since I has local units, for
each ι ∈ I there exists ζ ∈ I such that ζι = ι. Then for each λ ∈ LK(E), since λζ belongs
to I, we have

ψ(λι) = ψ((λζ)ι) = (λζ)ψ(ι) = λ · ψ(ζι) = λ · ψ(ι).

Composing ψ with the inclusion of I
This completes the ﬁrst step of the application of Baer’s Criterion Lemma 1.2.

To complete the second step required to apply Lemma 1.2, we have to prove that any

We ﬁrst assume J ′ = I. Let
