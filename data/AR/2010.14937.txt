Abstract

Neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering is studied in the plane wave impulse approximation

for three nuclear models: the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG), the independent-particle shell model

(IPSM) and the natural orbitals (NO) model with Lorentzian dependence of the excitation energy.

A complete study of the kinematics of the semi-inclusive process and the associated cross sections

are presented and discussed for 40Ar and 12C. Inclusive cross sections are also obtained by integrat-

ing the semi-inclusive expressions over the outgoing hadron. Results are consistent with previous

studies restricted to the inclusive channel. In particular, a comparison with the analytical results

for the RFG model is performed. Explicit expressions for the hadronic tensor and the 10 semi-

inclusive nuclear responses are given. Theoretical predictions are compared with semi-inclusive

experimental data from T2K experiment.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last years Neutrino Physics has become one of the most ﬂourishing ﬁelds in nuclear

and particle physics. In particular, physicists have devoted a great eﬀort in pursuing the

physics responsible for neutrino masses. As stated in the NuSTEC White Paper [1], ac-

celerator based neutrino scattering experiments have been identiﬁed as the highest priority

intermediate-future eﬀort by the world physics community. This explains the high interest

in international projects like the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [2], to be

hosted by Fermilab, and the Tokai-to-HyperKamioKande (T2HK) in Japan [3]. The main

goal of these experiments is focused on the analysis of the oscillations that neutrinos un-

dergo in travelling from a near to a far detector. The aim is not only to improve our present

knowledge on the oscillation mixing angles, but also to explore the CP-violating phase, that

is related to the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, assess the neutrino mass

hierarchy, and investigate possible physics beyond the standard model [1, 4, 5].

The analysis of neutrino properties, due to the smallness of the weak cross sections,

requires the use of large amounts of target material. In fact, most of the presently running

(T2K, NoVA) and planned (T2HK, DUNE) neutrino oscillation experiments use diﬀerent

complex nuclei as targets, such as carbon, oxygen, argon and iron. Thus, a precise enough

description of the interaction between neutrinos and nuclei is needed. Only by having an

excellent control of the nuclear eﬀects in the weak scattering process, will it be possible to

2

access without ambiguity to the real nature of neutrinos and their properties. This clearly

shows that only a close collaboration between theoretical and experimental groups from

both the nuclear and high energy physics communities will make it possible to overcome the

challenges we face.

In past years a great eﬀort has been devoted to the description of neutrino-nucleus ob-

servables with high accuracy. Very diﬀerent models, initially designed to describe electron

scattering reactions where there exist a large amount of data to compare with, have been ex-

tended to neutrino processes. As a general constraint any nuclear model aiming to describe

neutrino-nucleus interaction should be ﬁrst tested against electron scattering data. Starting

with the simple relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG), still widely used in the analysis of neutrino

oscillation data, models with diﬀerent levels of complexity have been applied to weak interac-

tion processes: nuclear spectral function [6–9], Relativistic Mean Field [10–15], Relativistic

Green Function (RGF) [16–19], Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [20–22], scaling-based

approaches [10, 13, 23–28] and ab-initio Green’s function Monte Carlo (GFMC) [29–31].

A basic diﬀerence between electron and neutrino scattering processes, in addition to the

weak versus electromagnetic interaction, concerns the beam energy. Whereas for electrons

the energy is perfectly known, the situation is clearly diﬀerent for neutrinos where the energy

is distributed along the neutrino ﬂux that can be extended from a few MeV up to several

GeV. This makes a crucial diﬀerence between the two scattering reactions that aﬀects not

only the particular description of the interaction between the lepton and the nuclear target,

but also the analysis of oscillation experiments and the speciﬁc information on the inner

properties of neutrinos.

At present most of the studies related to neutrino-nucleus scattering have concerned

inclusive measurements where only the scattered lepton is detected in the ﬁnal state. This

corresponds to (ν(cid:96), (cid:96)) processes where (cid:96) refers to the lepton in the ﬁnal state. Note that

this process is kinematically equivalent to inclusive electron scattering (e, e(cid:48)). However,

contrary to (e, e(cid:48)) processes where the momentum (q) and energy (ω) transferred to the

nucleus are perfectly known, for (ν(cid:96), (cid:96)) this is not so because of the neutrino beam energy

distribution (ﬂux). As a consequence, in the analysis of (ν(cid:96), (cid:96)) reactions very diﬀerent

reaction mechanisms can contribute signiﬁcantly to the cross sections for a given kinematics

of the ﬁnal lepton. Not only the quasielastic (QE) region should be carefully evaluated but

also nucleon resonances, two-particle two-hole (2p-2h) eﬀects, deep inelastic scattering and

3

even the region at very low momentum/energy transfer where the impulse approximation

is not applicable. This makes the theoretical description of neutrino-nucleus scattering

processes more demanding than the one corresponding to electrons. An illustrative example

of this came with the ﬁrst neutrino-carbon cross sections published by the MiniBooNE

collaboration [32]. It was found that data were largely underestimated by all theoretical

predictions based on the impulse approximation unless the value of the axial mass was

increased by more than

30% compared with the standard value, MA

1 GeV. This was

∼

(cid:39)

known as the “MA-puzzle”. It was soon realized that nuclear eﬀects beyond the impulse

approximation, in particular, the excitation of 2p-2h states, could remedy signiﬁcantly the

discrepancy between theory and data without need to modify the value of MA (see Refs. [33–

37] for details).

The determination of oscillation mixing angles, CP-violating phase and neutrino mass or-

dering from neutrino-nucleus scattering data requires to know precisely the neutrino energy.

Since the neutrino beams are not monochromatic, the incoming neutrino energy should be

reconstructed from the ﬁnal states in the reaction. Up to present this determination has

been based on the analysis of inclusive (ν(cid:96), (cid:96)) reactions assuming that the neutrino interacts

with a neutron in the nucleus at rest (likewise for antineutrinos and protons). This is a

very crude approximation that allows to determine the neutrino energy from the variables

of the lepton in the ﬁnal state, but with high uncertainty due to the eﬀects associated to the

nuclear dynamics and the diﬀerent channels involved in the reaction. The reader interested

in a study of the impact of nuclear eﬀects on the neutrino energy reconstruction can go to [1]

and references therein.

A way to improve signiﬁcantly the analysis, constraining the incident neutrino energy

much better, is to consider events in which not only the ﬁnal-state charged lepton is detected

but some hadron as well. In fact, a proper description of the hadrons and mesons in the ﬁnal-

state will be essential for the next-generation of neutrino experiments. This is connected to

the fact that modern experimental studies of neutrino-nucleus reactions rely on the use of

data simulations to determine the behavior of the detectors involved. This requires having a

reasonable control on the reconstruction of the energy neutrino which can be achieved more

precisely by analyzing the kinematics of the ﬁnal particles. This clearly shows the importance

to have realistic theoretical predictions corresponding to more exclusive processes where, in

addition to the ﬁnal lepton, other particles are detected. Although the theoretical prediction

4

of semi-inclusive reactions is much harder than modelling inclusive processes, the richer

structure of the cross sections allows one to better discriminate among diﬀerent models.

The extension of nuclear models to semi-inclusive reactions is one of the main challenges to

be faced by nuclear theorists working in the ﬁeld.

In this work we present a detailed study of semi-inclusive charged current (CC) processes:

(ν(cid:96), (cid:96)− p) and (ν(cid:96), (cid:96)+ n). We follow the seminal works developed in [38–41] and restrict

ourselves to the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) in which the semi-inclusive cross

section factorizes in a term dealing with the neutrino-nucleon interaction, namely, the single-

nucleon cross section, and the spectral function that incorporates the whole dependence on

the nuclear dynamics. The whole formalism is presented in the paper by writing the explicit

expressions of all the semi-inclusive weak responses entering in the cross section. Moreover,

the consistency of the calculations is proved by comparing the inclusive cross section obtained

by integrating the corresponding semi-inclusive one over the emitted nucleon variables with

the inclusive results already presented in the literature [5, 24, 25, 42]. This is shown for

diﬀerent nuclear models. Although being aware of the oversimpliﬁed description of the

scattering process provided by PWIA, a comparison with some semi-inclusive data recently

measured by the T2K collaboration is performed. In forthcoming work we will extend our

study to all available semi-inclusive data, and will include in our analysis the role played by

the ﬁnal state interactions (FSI) treated within the framework of the Relativistic Distorted

Wave Impulse Approximation (RDWIA), exploiting our past experience on the description

of semi-inclusive (e, e(cid:48)N ) reactions within a fully relativistic microscopic approach.

To conclude, in our present investigation we have restricted our interest to the kinemat-

ics corresponding to T2K (using carbon in the near detector) and DUNE (argon). Semi-

inclusive cross sections for both cases have been shown for selected kinematics as functions

of the ejected nucleon variables (momentum and angle) for the diﬀerent nuclear models.

The development and implementation in experimental event generators of a complete semi-

inclusive formalism for neutrino reactions will have a huge impact in the analysis of new

experiments more sensitive to hadron detection.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. II we present the general formalism for semi-

inclusive neutrino-nucleus scattering reactions. We discuss the general kinematics and eval-

uate the cross section in both the semi-inclusive and inclusive regimes. The discussion on

the nuclear models is presented in Sect. III: here we show the cross sections obtained for

5

the Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG), Independent Particle Shell Model (IPSM) and Natural

Orbitals (NO). Explicit expressions for the ﬂux-averaged semi-inclusive cross sections are

provided for the three cases.

In Sect. IV we present our results for diﬀerent kinematics

corresponding to T2K and DUNE experiments. Sect. IV A contains a detailed discussion on

the semi-inclusive cross sections, while in Sect. IV B we compare our predictions with some

data taken by the T2K collaboration [43]. The case of inclusive responses is considered in

Sect. IV C proving the consistency of the calculations. Finally, in Sect. IV D we discuss the

eﬀects associated to the use of diﬀerent descriptions of the weak current operator, i.e., oﬀ-

shell eﬀects. This is discussed for the semi-inclusive cross sections as well as for the inclusive

ones considering the RFG and IPSM. In Sect. V we summarize our conclusions.

II. GENERAL FORMALISM

In this section we deﬁne the kinematics of the quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus reaction and

set up the general formalism for the corresponding diﬀerential cross section in both the

semi-inclusive and inclusive channels.

Finally, let us ﬁx the axes direction. We consider that the three-momentum k deﬁnes

(cid:112)

the direction of the z-axis. We choose this frame - referred to as the k-system - because

the direction of the neutrino beam is known in experiments, so we can directly compare our

results with experimental data. All the kinematic variables are represented in Fig. 4. To

make clear the discussion we distinguish between the scattering plane and the reaction one.

The former, represented in pink, is deﬁned by the neutrino beam momentum k (z-axis) and

the ejected lepton momentum k(cid:48). The reaction plane, represented in blue, contains k and

the ejected nucleon momentum pN . Thus, the three-momenta deﬁned in the x, y, z frame
(see Fig. 4) are

k = kez,

k(cid:48) = k(cid:48)(sin θlex + cos θlez),

pN = pN (cos φL

N sin θL

N ex + sin φL

N sin θL

N ey + cos θL

N ez) ,

(20)

where φL

N is the angle formed by the two planes. Note that the transferred momentum, q, is
contained in the scattering plane (xz) and θq represents the angle between q and k whereas
θl is the scattering angle, i.e., the angle between k and k’. Finally, θL

N represents the polar
angle that deﬁnes the direction of the ejected nucleon momentum pN with respect to the
z-axis (k-direction).

9

It is important to distinguish between the k-system deﬁned above and the q-system

usually considered in the analysis of semi-inclusive electron scattering processes.

In the

latter the z-axis is chosen to be along the momentum transfer q. Hence the two systems

are simply related by a rotation of an angle θq within the scattering plane. In Sect. II C

and Appendix A we will use the q-system to evaluate the response functions because of its

special symmetries.

Semi-inclusive cross section

In this work we restrict our attention to the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA)

where, neglecting the contribution of the lower components in the relativistic bound nucleon

wave function, the cross section factorizes into a term dealing with the weak interaction of

a single nucleon in the nucleus and the nuclear spectral function that embodies the nuclear

dynamics in the process. The “factorized” ansatz has been shown to work properly in the

case of inclusive processes providing good agreement with experiment.

In the future we

will extend our study by including the role of ﬁnal state interactions (FSI) that break in

general the factorizable form. The sixth-diﬀerential semi-inclusive cross section with respect

to the momenta k(cid:48) and pN and the solid angles Ωk(cid:48) = (θl, φl) and ΩL

The expressions (21) and (22) depend on the variables of the ﬁnal lepton and the out-

going nucleon and assume that the neutrino energy k, and therefore the transferred four-

momentum (ω, q), are ﬁxed. However, in comparing the results obtained using this equation

with experimental data it is necessary to take into account that in long-baseline oscillation

experiments the neutrino beam does not have a well-deﬁned energy: a particle accelerator

boosts protons which collide with a target, for instance graphite or beryllium, producing

charged pions and kaons. Then, these positive (negative) hadrons decay to produce a ﬂux

usually highly dominated by νµ (¯νµ): depending of the speciﬁc experiment, there is a more

11

or less extended range of initial neutrino energies that participate in the reaction. As a

consequence one needs to average over all the possible energies in order to compare with the

experimental data. As already mentioned, in this work we will concentrate our attention on

two of these experiments, namely T2K [45] and DUNE [2]. The corresponding ﬂuxes for the

muonic neutrinos are presented in Fig. 5 [46, 47].

From semi-inclusive to inclusive

Starting from the above expression one can recover the inclusive cross section by inte-

grating over the variables of the outgoing nucleon. In this case we use the q-system (see

Fig. 22) where the transfer momentum determines the z-axis. This frame presents some

special symmetries that simplify signiﬁcantly the calculation of the various response func-

tions that enter in the scattering process. In Appendix A we present in detail the connection

between the variables deﬁned in the k- and q-systems and show the explicit calculation of

all the weak hadronic responses. In the q-system the outgoing nucleon momentum is given

by

pN = pN (cos φN sin θN e1 + sin φN sin θN e2 + cos θN e3) ,

Fig. 22). Note that the connection between these unit vectors and the ones introduced in

the k-system is simply given by a rotation of the angle θq contained in the scattering plane.

The angle between the scattering and reaction planes is given by φN while θN determines

the direction of the ejected nucleon momentum pN with respect to q.

Obviously the use of the k or q-systems does not aﬀect the result for the inclusive cross

section since the diﬀerential of the solid angle is the same in all frames connected to each

other by a rotation:

VK are the inclusive leptonic responses given in Appendix A and RK are the weak nuclear

response functions. These embody the whole dependence on the nuclear model and are given

by taking the appropriate, charge (C), longitudinal (L) and transverse (T ), components of

the weak nuclear tensor [24].

As for the semi-inclusive case, before comparing the theoretical predictions with experi-

mental data an average over the neutrino ﬂux must be performed:

(38)

It is worth mentioning that, although this work only deals with the charged-current

reaction, by integrating the semi-inclusive cross section over the ﬁnal lepton variables one

obtains the ‘u-inclusive” cross section [48] that only depends on the variables of the outgoing

nucleon:

This is the measured cross section in neutral current reactions, where the outgoing neutrino

cannot be detected.

III. NUCLEAR MODELS: THE SPECTRAL FUNCTION

The lepton-hadron cross section is proportional to the contraction of the leptonic and

hadronic tensors. However, the hadronic tensor, W µν, for a complex nucleus is in general

a complicated object and can be evaluated only under some approximations. The expres-

sion (21) for the cross section is based on the assumption that it can be factorized as [40]

W µν =

µν(PA

(40)

PA−1, Q) is the oﬀ-shell single-nucleon response tensor [49], corresponding

where

µν(PA

to the scattering with a moving oﬀ-shell nucleon, and S(pm, Em) is the nuclear spectral

function, which describes the joint probability of ﬁnding a nucleon with given momentum

pm in a nucleus and of reaching a ﬁnal state with excitation energy (or, equivalently, missing

energy Em) of the residual nuclear system [50]. The oﬀ-shell single-nucleon tensor will be

analyzed in Appendix A for the case of charged current reactions.

The spectral function is normalized as [41]

n(pm) =

dEmS(pm, Em) ,

(cid:90)

(41)

where n(pm) is the proton or neutron momentum distribution. Therefore S is correctly

normalized if the relation

is the number of nucleons that are active in the scattering, i.e. the

N

number of neutrons, N , for the case of neutrino scattering (CCν) and the number of protons,

Z, for antineutrinos (CC¯ν).

We shall now provide the explicit expression for the spectral function in three simple

nuclear models: the Independent-Particle Shell Model (IPSM), the Natural Orbitals Shell

Model (NO) and the Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG).

A.

Independent-Particle Shell Model (IPSM)

In the IPSM the nucleons are bound by a potential and occupy discrete energy levels

Enlj. The scattering process for this model is represented in Fig. 6: a nucleon absorbs

−
energy from the probe and produces an on-shell nucleon with relativistic kinetic energy

Since

By inserting Eq. (43) into Eq. (22) we obtain the semi-inclusive cross section for the

IPSM:

we get

B. Natural Orbitals Shell Model (NO).

This model takes into account nucleon-nucleon correlations and the smearing of the en-

ergy eigenstates.

It employs natural orbitals, ψα(r), which are deﬁned as the complete

orthonormal set of single-particle wave functions that diagonalize the one-body density ma-

trix (OBDM) [51]:

ρ(r, r(cid:48)) =

where the eigenvalues Nα(0

The NO single-particle wave functions, that include short-range nucleon-nucleon (NN)

correlations, are used to obtain the occupation numbers and the wave functions in momen-

tum space, i.e., the momentum distributions, and from them the spectral function that is

given by [52]

C. Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG)

This model consists in describing the nucleus as an inﬁnite gas of free relativistic nucleons

that, in the nuclear ground state, occupy all the levels up to the Fermi momentum kF while

the levels above that are empty. The Fermi momentum is the only free parameter of the

model. It is usually ﬁtted to the width of the quasielastic peak in electron scattering data [53]

energy in this model is negative [39]:

to cure this problem and to be more consistent with the other models considered in this

(cid:112)

work, we adopt the prescription of Ref. [41]: we shift the RFG energies by a constant in

such a way that the last occupied level in the Fermi sea coincides with -Es, as shown in

Fig. 7. This amounts to putting the nucleons oﬀ-shell by changing their free energy as

E =

IV. RESULTS

In this section we present and discuss semi-inclusive and inclusive results for the IPSM,

NO and RFG models illustrated in the previous Section, considering two diﬀerent neutrino

ﬂuxes (DUNE and T2K) and two nuclear targets, 40Ar and 12C.

Let us brieﬂy summarize the main features of each model. For the IPSM we describe the

bound nucleon states as self-consistent Dirac-Hartree solutions, derived within a relativistic

mean ﬁeld (RMF) approach using a Lagrangian containing ρ, σ and ω mesons [56, 57]. These

relativistic single-particle wave functions are used to obtain the momentum distribution of

each shell for both types of nucleons in the nucleus. In the NO approach the single-particle

22

wave functions are non-relativistic, but they include short-range NN correlations. They

are used to generate the momentum distributions for the diﬀerent shells. In this case the

energy delta-functions corresponding to each shell are replaced by Lorentzian distributions

(see [58, 59] for details). The RFG is the simplest among the three models and does not

account for the shell structure of the nucleus, because the nucleons are non-interacting.

However the model is fully relativistic and is still employed in most event generators used

in experiments.

In the discussion that follows we focus on the RFG and IPSM in the case of argon

(DUNE experiment), whereas for carbon (T2K experiment) we explore in addition the results

provided by NO. Momentum distributions for 40Ar and 12C are presented in Fig. 8 showing

the complex dependence upon the missing momentum for the IPSM and the NO models,

whereas the RFG distribution is basically a step function. As we will see later, under some

ﬁxed kinematics, the shape and magnitude of the semi-inclusive cross section will be strongly

dependent on the momentum distribution, hence the results for the RFG model will be quite

diﬀerent from the other two.

A.

Semi-inclusive cross sections.

In sections III A, III B and III C we deduced the semi-inclusive cross sections for the IPSM,

NO and RFG models using the spectral function deﬁned for each case. Since we want to

shed some light on the discrepancies between the models, in what follows we select some

speciﬁc kinematics where the dependence of the momentum distribution with the missing

momentum is particularly relevant.

We begin considering the semi-inclusive cross sections for IPSM and RFG with muon

momentum k(cid:48) = 1.5 GeV, muon scattering angle θl = 30◦ and two diﬀerent values for the
azimuthal angle deﬁned in the k-system, namely φL
N = 180◦ and φL
N = 165◦, as function of
N . We consider 40Ar as the target and
use the neutrino ﬂux corresponding to DUNE. Results for the RFG model are presented in

the ejected nucleon momentum pN and the angle θL

and “hawk” (bottom) views. The graphs on the left correspond to φL

Fig. 9 using kF = 0.241 GeV for two diﬀerent points of view, namely “side” (top panels)
N = 180◦ while the ones
N = 165◦. In both cases the shape of the cross section is simple being only
kF . Note that the

diﬀerent from zero in a very well-deﬁned area given by the condition pm

for the set of variables that gives the maximum cross sections in Figs. 9 and 10 together with

the support of the spectral function for the two models. In the case of the IPSM (dashed

curves) the two trajectories corresponding to the two φL

N -values cross the speciﬁc missing
energies for the diﬀerent shells at very diﬀerent values of the missing momentum. Whereas

for φL

N = 180◦ the crossing occurs in the region of low-pm, i.e., pm

50 MeV/c, the situation

is clearly diﬀerent for φL

N = 165◦ where the crossing takes place at larger pm-values (pm

explains the great reduction observed in the maximum of the semi-inclusive cross section

when going from φL

N = 180◦ to φL

N = 165◦.

The situation is clearly diﬀerent for the RFG model. Here the trajectories for the two

φL
N -values (dot-dashed lines) are very close to each other and they cross the value of the RFG
240 MeV/c, i.e., just below the Fermi level. As known, the RFG

momentum distribution is constant and diﬀerent from zero up to pm = kF . Thus the 15%

reduction observed in the maxima of the semi-inclusive cross sections for the two φL

N -values
cannot be connected with the momentum distribution but with the speciﬁc kinematical

factors (evaluated at the particular allowed values for the remaining kinematical variables)

that enter in the cross section.

of the high peak in the cross section shown in Fig. 10 for φL

Using the general expression for the trajectory Em(pm) we can also analyze the origin
N = 180◦. Since this result is
not present in the case of the RFG (Fig. 9), we assume its origin is linked to the complex,

non-constant, structure shown by the global momentum distribution in the IPSM. As al-

ready shown in Fig. 13, the IPSM trajectory corresponding to φL

N = 180◦ is consistent with
signiﬁcant contribution in the momentum distribution at low missing momentum values.

This is the region where the various s-shells entering in 40Ar clearly dominate, giving rise

to the maximum in the cross section observed in Fig. 10. In fact, if one excludes the s-shell

contributions the semi-inclusive cross section decreases signiﬁcantly. This is illustrated in

Fig. 14 that shows the contour graph of the semi-inclusive cross section including all shells

in 40Ar (top panel) and removing the contribution of the s-shells (bottom panel). Note the

the neutrino ﬂux on the shape of the semi-inclusive cross section. More speciﬁcally, we

analyze how the shape of the semi-inclusive cross sections changes with the experimental

neutrino ﬂux that is given in bins as shown in Fig. 5. Results for the RFG (projected cross

section in the (pN , θL

experimental ﬂux (with the bins) leads to the appearance of some discontinuities or jumps

in the cross section that are distributed along the pN axis as the value of θL

N changes. This

occurs because the neutrino energy is also a function of pN and θL

N and it increases when
we move to higher values of pN . Hence, it is simply a direct consequence of the change of

bin in the experimental neutrino ﬂux. This is clearly seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 15

a continuous function ﬁtted to the neutrino ﬂux. As observed, the discontinuities are not

semi-inclusive cross sections for both models are highly correlated with the shapes of the

momentum distributions (see bottom panel in Fig. 8). Notice that the cross section for the

IPSM in Fig. 16 (left) shows a small hole in the center of the region that is not present in the

case of the NO model (right). An analysis of the trajectory curves shows that this particular

region in the (pN , θL

Note that the behavior of the momentum distribution for the two models, IPSM and NO,

diﬀers at low-pm: the former decreases as pm approaches zero whereas the latter does not.

B. Comparison with semi-inclusive experimental data.

In this section we compare our predictions with some recent data from the T2K col-

laboration [43] corresponding to neutrino scattering on 12C with a muon and an ejected

proton measured in the ﬁnal state. We only present some preliminary results based on the

PWIA and the three nuclear models considered in this work. A more complete analysis

including a systematic comparison with all available semi-inclusive data will be presented

in a forthcoming publication. The role played by the ﬁnal state interactions (FSI) will

be also considered in the future within the general scheme of the Distorted Wave Impulse

Approximation (DWIA).

proximation (PWIA). This is obviously an oversimpliﬁed description of both the reaction

mechanism and the ﬁnal state dynamics. FSI and ingredients beyond the IA like Meson

Exchange Currents (MEC) can play a signiﬁcant role in describing the data. This is con-

sistent with the analysis presented in [43] based on results obtained using diﬀerent event

generators. However, it is not yet entirely clear how precisely the event generator transport

mechanisms can reproduce the eﬀects ascribed to the ﬁnal state interactions.

C.

Inclusive cross sections.

Although the main objective of this work is the analysis of semi-inclusive CCν reactions,

in what follows we consider the case of inclusive reactions where only the ﬁnal lepton is

detected. This topic has been studied in detail by several groups using very diﬀerent models

that incorporate not only diverse descriptions of the nuclear dynamics but also FSI, two-

particle two-hole (2p-2h) contributions, nucleon resonances and deep inelastic scattering [1].

Moreover, extensive studies of inclusive neutrino scattering processes based on scaling ar-

guments have been developed by our group in the past [5, 13, 23, 24, 26, 60, 61]. In all

the cases a systematic comparison with data has been provided. Hence, in this section our

semi-inclusive processes, when applied to inclusive reactions.

As we discussed in Section II C, the inclusive results can be recovered from the semi-

inclusive ones by integrating over the kinematical variables corresponding to the nucleon

detected in coincidence with the lepton in the ﬁnal state.

In Fig. 18 we show the ﬂux-

averaged double-diﬀerential inclusive cross sections for 12C evaluated for the three nuclear

models, RFG (red dashed line), IPSM (blue solid) and NO (green dot-dashed). Comparison

with T2K experimental data [62] is also provided. In spite of the very diﬀerent momentum

distributions for the three nuclear models, particularly in the case of the RFG, the inclusive

cross sections are very similar, except for θµ angles close to zero (i.e., small energy transfer)

where the IPSM and the NO results deviate very signiﬁcantly from the RFG ones being much

higher than data. As discussed in [28, 63], the PWIA approach fails in describing lepton-

nucleus scattering reactions at low values of the momentum and energy transfers. This is a

consequence of the lack of orthogonality between the bound and free nucleon wave functions,

and the extremely large eﬀects associated to the overlap between the non-orthogonal initial

and ﬁnal states in the near-threshold region. In the case of the RFG, the cross section at very

forward scattering angles is signiﬁcantly reduced and more in accordance with data. This

result is largely due to the Pauli blocking eﬀects included in the model. Notice that IPSM

and NO lead to similar semi-inclusive responses (see Figs. 9 and 10), being very diﬀerent

from the predictions provided by RFG (Fig. 16).

In the previous sections we have worked in the q-system in order to get the inclusive

responses. A similar analysis can be performed working in the k-system. In this case, the

neutrino-averaged inclusive cross section can be written as

the consistency of the calculations by solving numerically the integrals in Eq. (89).

of cos θl as function of the momentum of the muon k(cid:48) for RFG model (Eq. (74)), IPSM (Eq. (49))

and NO model (Eq. (58)). Data taken from [62].

For the three models considered in this work the semi-inclusive cross sections in the k-

system to be integrated are Eqs. (72), (48), (55). The results obtained should be consistent

with the ones corresponding to Eq. (74) for the RFG, Eq. (49) for the IPSM and Eq. (58)

for the NO, respectively. This is illustrated in Fig. 19 where the inclusive cross sections for

12C using the T2K ﬂux are presented. No diﬀerence is observed between the calculations

performed in the two systems for the three models. Although not shown here for simplicity,

a further test of the consistency of the calculations has been performed using the RFG

model. The simplicity of this model makes it possible to solve the problem in an analytical

way getting closed expressions for the observables of interest. We have checked that these

analytical results coincide with the corresponding ones obtained by solving the integrals

D. Oﬀ-shell eﬀects.

To conclude, in what follows we discuss the eﬀects in the cross sections associated to the

use of diﬀerent descriptions of the weak current operator. As shown in Appendix A, the

semi-inclusive responses contained in

2
χ are given by speciﬁc components of the hadronic
tensor, that is a bilinear combination of the current operator matrix elements between the

F

initial and ﬁnal nucleon wave functions. As known, the weak current of the nucleon consists

of a vector and an axial-vector terms. Following previous studies on electron scattering

reactions [64–67], diﬀerent options can be considered for the vector term. By analogy with

the electromagnetic case, these are denoted as CC1 and CC2 prescriptions (see Appendix A

for explicit expressions). The two operators are equivalent for free on-shell nucleons and are

connected to each other by the Gordon transformation. However, the IPSM and NO models

deal in general with oﬀ-shell bound nucleons, whereas ejected nucleons are on-shell in the

PWIA. Hence the two operators lead to diﬀerent results. The particular case of the RFG

model requires some discussion. The RFG uses relativistic free wave functions, solutions of

the free Dirac equation, for all nucleons. Hence, no diﬀerence between results obtained with

the two prescriptions of the vector current should exist. However, the use of a value of the

separation energy ﬁtted to the experiment in addition to the Fermi kinetic energy breaks

the equivalence between the two currents, introducing at some level oﬀ-shell eﬀects. These

with ω deﬁned in Eq. (80). In the pure RFG the separation energy is negative and equal

to minus the Fermi kinetic energy (see Eq. (59)), hence δ = 0 and no oﬀ-shell eﬀects are

present. In the general case in which Es is ﬁtted to experiment, the value of δ diﬀers from

zero and the election of the particular version of the vector current, CC1 or CC2, leads to

diﬀerent results. Appendix A contains the detailed calculation of all the weak single-nucleon

responses. The case δ = 0 leads to the on-shell result.

The role played by oﬀ-shell eﬀects is illustrated in Fig. 20. Here we present the inclusive

neutrino-12C cross section as a function of the muon energy at diﬀerent kinematical situations

deﬁned by the scattering angle and the neutrino energy. Each panel contains ﬁve curves that

correspond to the RFG and IPSM models. In the former three options are considered: i) the

on-shell limit, i.e., RFG with δ = 0 (solid blue line), ii) RFG with oﬀ-shell eﬀects and the

CC1 prescription for the vector current (red solid) and iii) same as in the previous case but for

the CC2 current (cyan dot-dashed). For the IPSM we show the results corresponding to the

CC2 (green dashed) and CC1 (black dotted) currents. Comparing the results for the RFG

with the two currents and δ ﬁxed by separation energy, we observe a minor, almost negligible,

discrepancy. The same comment applies to the two IPSM results. This is consistent with

previous studies for electron scattering where it was shown that the use of CC1 or CC2

current operators is almost irrelevant for inclusive responses in the PWIA limit [42, 64, 65].

On the contrary, the pure on-shell RFG result deviates signiﬁcantly from the other models.

As shown, the role of δ

= 0 is to shift the RFG cross section to smaller values of the

muon energy by an amount that depends on the particular kinematics considered. Also the

maximum in the cross section varies slightly (increasing or diminishing). Notice that the

position of these maxima for the two oﬀ-shell RFG calculations coincides with the IPSM.

Furthermore, the inclusive cross sections are similar except for the tails present in the IPSM

due to the bound nucleon momentum distribution.

The analysis of the oﬀ-shell eﬀects in semi-inclusive cross sections is illustrated in Fig. 21.

Results in the top panel correspond to the ratio between the diﬀerence and the sum of

the semi-inclusive cross sections evaluated with the two current prescriptions in the IPSM

distribution drops very quickly as pm increases. As already shown in Fig. 10, the semi-

coincides with the one where the semi-inclusive cross sections is visible (Fig. 10). The

percent ratio in this region (top panel) is very small, below

3%. This implies that

oﬀ-shell eﬀects are very minor in the region where the semi-inclusive cross section gets most

of its strength. However, some caution should be drawn on this general conclusion as only

a speciﬁc kinematics has been explored, and more importantly, the addition of ﬁnal state

interactions could modify signiﬁcantly these results.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented the general formalism for semi-inclusive charged-current

neutrino-nucleus reactions, i.e., processes where an incident neutrino (antineutrino) inter-

acts with a nucleus and a ﬁnal lepton (antilepton) is detected in coincidence with some other

particle. We have restricted our attention to the quasielastic kinematic regime and have as-

sumed the impulse approximation, namely, only one-body current operators are considered.

The ﬁnal particle detected in coincidence with the lepton is a single nucleon: proton (neu-

tron) for neutrino (antineutrino) scattering. Three diﬀerent models have been considered to

deal with the nuclear dynamics involved in the problem: the relativistic fermi gas (RFG),

the independent particle shell model (IPSM), but with fully relativistic wave functions so-

lutions of the Dirac equation, and the natural orbitals (NO) shell model that accounts for

NN correlations.

The whole analysis has been performed assuming factorization in the cross section and

the plane wave limit for the ﬁnal nucleon state. Although being aware of the oversimpliﬁed

description of the reaction and, particularly, the signiﬁcant modiﬁcations that FSI may

introduce in the analysis, we are conﬁdent that the present results help in improving our

understanding on the dynamical properties of semi-inclusive cross sections. This will have an

important impact in determining the neutrino beam energy with more precision, an essential

requirement in the analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments.

Flux-averaged semi-inclusive cross sections corresponding to DUNE (argon) and T2K

(carbon) experiments have been presented. The results show that RFG diﬀers completely

from the two shell-based models, IPSM and NO. Not only the shape of the semi-inclusive

cross section is totally diﬀerent, without any sub-shell structure, but also its magnitude

and behavior with the kinematic variables, particularly, with the azimuthal angle of the

outgoing nucleon φL

N . On the contrary, IPSM and NO lead to rather similar results showing
only some discrepancies in the low-pm region because of the eﬀects of NN correlations.

We have checked the consistency of all calculations by recovering the inclusive observables

from the semi-inclusive ones (integrating over the ejected nucleon variables) and comparing

them with those already published in the literature. It is important to point out that the

three models produce similar results for the inclusive cross sections, even being dramatically

diﬀerent for the semi-inclusive ones (RFG compared to IPSM and NO). The richer structure

of the semi-inclusive cross section will help to better discriminate among diﬀerent models,

providing also a more reliable method to reconstruct the incident neutrino energy.

Theoretical predictions for the cross section against the ejected nucleon momentum have

been compared with some of the recent T2K data. In spite of the above mentioned approx-

imations considered, all the three models are capable of reproducing the data , with the

including all available data will be presented in a forthcoming work.

Oﬀ-shell eﬀects have been studied in the past in the case of inclusive and semi-inclusive

electron scattering processes. Here we have extended this analysis to neutrino-nucleus reac-

tions. Using for the vector part of the weak current the two usual prescriptions, CC1 and

CC2, we have shown results for inclusive as well as semi-inclusive cross sections. In the latter

it is shown that the region where oﬀ-shell eﬀects are larger corresponds to high pm-values,

a region where the cross section is almost negligible. A similar comment applies to the in-

clusive cross section when comparing results for a speciﬁc model and the two prescriptions,

CC1/CC2. A particular case emerges for the RFG in the on-shell limit where the inclusive

cross section is shifted by a signiﬁcant amount to larger values of the ﬁnal lepton energy.

To conclude, this work represents a ﬁrst step towards a more sophisticated description of

the semi-inclusive reaction, where all the formalism is settled and some basic models for the

nuclear initial state are applied and tested. Some caution should be drawn on the numerical

results presented, as ﬁnal state interactions may introduce signiﬁcant modiﬁcations. Work

along this line is in progress.

Appendix A: The Reduced Single-Nucleon Cross Section

This appendix contains the detailed calculation of all the reduced single-nucleon weak

responses that enter in the semi-inclusive cross section introduced in previous sections. The

CC neutrino (antineutrino)-nucleon scattering reactions to be considered are:

The cross section for the previous processes can be constructed from the single-nucleon

tensor that is given from the single-nucleon current matrix elements. These contain the

weak charged-current operators and the wave functions for the initial (bound) and emitted

nucleons. As known, the weak current operator consists of a vector and an axial-vector
parts, i.e., ˆJ µ

As already mentioned, the q- and k-systems are related by a rotation in the scattering

plane of an angle θq that deﬁnes the direction of the neutrino momentum, k, with respect

to the momentum transfer, q. Thus, we can write

cos θq =

k

−

k(cid:48) cos θl
q

.

(A69)

The connection between the angular variables of the ejected nucleon momentum in the

k-system, θL

N , φL

N , and the corresponding ones in the q-system, θN , φN , is as follows:

cos θN = cos θL

N cos θq

Using these general results to evaluate the VV, AV and AA components of the single-

nucleon tensor (A7, A8, A9), and taking the appropriate components, the single-nucleon

responses in terms of the several kinematical variables and the oﬀ-shell term δ, can be

written as (for simplicity, we only show the responses for the CC2 prescription)
