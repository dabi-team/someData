Two different types of boron-doped graphene/copper interfaces synthesized using two different 

flow rates of Ar through the bubbler containing the boron source were studied. X-ray 

photoelectron spectra (XPS) and optically stimulated electron emission (OSEE) measurements 

have demonstrated that boron-doped graphene coating provides a high corrosion resistivity of 

Cu-substrate with the light traces of the oxidation of carbon cover. The density functional theory 

calculations suggest that for the case of substitutional (graphitic) boron-defect only the 

oxidation near boron impurity is energetically favorable and creation of the vacancies that can 

induce the oxidation of copper substrate is energetically unfavorable. In the case of non-

graphitic boron defects oxidation of the area, a nearby impurity is metastable that not only 

prevent oxidation but makes boron-doped graphene. Modeling of oxygen reduction reaction 

demonstrates high catalytic performance of these materials.

1. Introduction 

Graphene-based  materials  were  extensively  studied  last  years  due  to  their  special  for  carbon 

allotropes  2D-structure  and  extraordinary  mechanical,  electrical  and  chemical  properties  [1-5]. 

To further improve their usefulness, many methods have been suggested among them, the doping 

with heteroatoms (such as B, N, P, and S) has been shown to be an effective way to modify the 

electrochemical properties and to enhance their  capacitive performances [6-8]. Particularly, the 

doping of graphene by boron seems to be very attractive because of their close atomic sizes that 

should avoid the formation of structural defects such as  carbon vacancies which are found, for 

instance, under doping of graphene by nitrogen [9]. According to DFT calculations, the energy 

barrier to incorporate the boron atoms to graphene lattice is lower compared with that of nitrogen 

[10].  Incorporation  of  boron  atoms  into  an  aromatic  carbon  framework  like  carbon  nanotubes 

[11] and graphene [12] offers a wide variety of functionality in, for example, chemical sensing 

[13, 14], nanoelectronics [15, 16], photocatalysis [17] and battery electrodes [18]. On the other 

hand, the chemical stability of boron-doped graphene coatings is not studied yet although boron 

has  been  found  to  be  unique  and  efficient  dopant  for  improving  the  oxidation  resistance  of 

graphite [19-22]. In the present paper, we have studied oxidation resistance of copper coated by 

boron-doped  graphene  using  XPS  and  OSEE  spectroscopy.  The  obtained  results  are  compared 

with DFT calculations of formation energies of a different configuration of structural defects in 

boron-doped  graphene  and  could  also  be  used  for  the  understanding  of  chemical  properties  of 

boron-doped graphene.   

2. Experimental and Calculation Details 

The samples of B-doped graphene B-Gr50 and B-Gr100 were synthesized at Clemson University 

on Cu substrates using two different flow rates of Ar through the bubbler containing the boron 

source  (50  sccm  and  100  sccm  respectively),  keeping  the  total  flow  rate  of  Ar  at  450  sccm 

through the substrate (Fig. 1).

X-ray  photoelectron  spectra  (XPS)  were  measured  using  a  PHI  5000  Versa  Probe  XPS 

spectrometer (ULVAC Physical Electronics, USA) based on a classic X-ray optic scheme with a 

hemispherical  quartz  monochromator  and  an  energy  analyzer  working  in  the  range  of  binding 

energies from 0 to 1500 eV. Electrostatic focusing and magnetic screening were used to achieve 

an energy resolution of ‚àÜE ‚â§ 0.5 eV for the Al KŒ± radiation (1486.6 eV). An ion pump was used 

to  maintain  the  analytical  chamber  at  10-7  Pa,  and  dual  channel  neutralization  was  used  to 

compensate  local  surface  charge  generated  during  the  measurements.  The  XPS  spectra  were 

recorded using Al KŒ± x-ray emission - spot size was 200 ¬µm, the x-ray power delivered at the 

sample was less than 50 W, and typical signal-to-noise ratios were greater than 10000:3.

The  optically  stimulated  electron  emission  (OSEE)  measurements  were  carried  out  on 

experimental spectrometer ASED-1. Optical stimulation of the surface of the sample was carried 

out using the grating monochromator MSD-2, quartz optical system, deuterium lamp DDS-400 

and  secondary  electron  multiplier  VEU-6  as  electron  detector.  The  measurements  were  carried 

out in the oil-free vacuum of 10-4 Pa at room temperature.  

We  used  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  implemented  in  the  pseudopotential  code 

SIESTA,  [23]  as  in  our  previous  studies  of  similar  graphene-based  systems  [24-25].  All

calculations were performed using the local density approximation (LDA) with spin-polarization 

[26] which is provides better agreement with experiments [27]. During the optimization, the ion 

cores  were  described  by  norm-conserving  non-relativistic  pseudo-potentials  [28]  with  cut  off 

radii 1.25, 1.14, 1.59 a.u. for C, O, and B, respectively, and the wave functions were expanded 

with  localized  orbitals  and  a  double-Œ∂  plus  polarization  basis  set  for  other  species.  The  atomic 

positions  were  fully  optimized,  and  optimization  of  the  force  and  total  energy  was  performed 

with an accuracy of 0.04 eV/√Ö and 1 meV, respectively. All calculations were carried out with 

an energy mesh cut-off of 300 Ry and a k-point mesh of 8√ó6√ó2 in the Monkhorst-Pack scheme 

[29]. A rectangular graphene supercell of 48 carbon atoms over 4 layers (24 atoms each) slab of 

(111)  surface  of  fcc  lattice  of  copper  was  used  [24]  with  a  single  boron  atom  in  the  supercell 

which  corresponds  to  an  impurity  concentration  around  2%  Used  model  provides  separation 

between  boron  impurities  more  than  1  nm  (four  graphene  lattice  parameters).  Thus,  boron 

impurities can be discussed as independent and the model can be used also for description of the 

lower concertation of the impurities.

3. Results and Discussions 

3.1. Raman and XPS Measurements 

The incorporation of boron into graphene lattice is confirmed by Raman spectra measurements 

(Fig. 2).  The Raman spectra are characterized by two prominent peaks at 1340 and 1598 cm-1, 

which correspond to the D and G modes, respectively. The G band originated from the doubly 

degenerate  Brillouin  zone  center  E2g  phonon  mode  and  associated  with  sp2-hybridized  carbon 

networks.  The  dispersive  D  band  correlates  with  sp3  hybridized  carbon  atoms  as  it  requires  a 

defect for its activation by double resonance, thus indicating the presence of lattice defects and 

distortions induced by boron impurity atoms [30, 31].

(Fig. 3) which show the presence both sp2 and sp3-contributions from graphene sheet and carbon 

defects,  respectively,  and  also  small  oxidation  of  carbon  atoms  due  to  the  formation  of  C-O

Figure 5. XPS Cu 2p spectra of boron doped graphene/Cu interface. 

XPS Cu 2p spectra of  B-doped graphene/Cu interface are found to be very  similar  to undoped 

graphene/Cu  case  and  Cu  metal  and  quite  different  concerning  that  of  CuO  (see  Fig.  5).  The 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absence  of  additional  features  in  XPS  specters  demonstrates  that  neither  carbon  nor  boron 

impurities do not penetrate to the copper substrate.  

3.2. Optical properties 

The results of OSEE measurements obtained by using the equation (1) [34] are reported in Fig. 6 

and Table I.

In  Tab.  I  we  report  the  values  of  parameters  œÜ  and  n  which  have  been  found  by  the 

approximation  of  the  experimental  dependences.  Analysis  of  the  data  in  the  table  leads  to  the 

7 

 
 
 
 
  
following conclusions.  The values of n=2.5 which are found for samples under investigation are 

typical for  non-direct optical transitions  [34] which means that process of optical  excitation of 

electrons (Valence Band‚ÜíConduction Band‚ÜíVacuum Level) is realized with the participation 

of phonon sub-system. Work function œÜ provides the process of ionization of electronic states of 

sample  surfaces.  The  œÜ-values  reported  in  the  Table  I  (4.7  -4.8  eV)  are  very  similar  for  both 

samples and very close to that of metallic copper (4.5 eV). On the other hand, the measured œÜ-

values  are  essentially  different  concerning  those  of  Cu-oxides  (œÜ  =  5.15  ‚Äì  5.34  eV).  [35] 

Therefore  according  to  results  of  OSEE  measurements,  we  also  have  not  found  any  traces  of 

copper oxidation in boron-doped graphene/Cu interfaces.

3.3. Modeling of the atomic structure 

For  the  understanding  of  the  effect  of  boron  doping  on  protective  properties  of  graphene,  we 

performed the set of DFT modelings. At the first step, we examine atomic structure and stability 

of boron-doped graphene on copper substrate. Results of the calculations (Tab.  II) demonstrate 

that  graphene  substrate  distances  and  binding  energies  are  closer  to  the  calculated  values  for 

graphene  on  nickel  than  on  copper  substrate.  Huge  difference  between  nickel  and  copper 

substrates caused by the mismatch in translation vectors of graphene lattice and (111) surface of 

discussed  metals.  In  the  case  of  nickel  substrate  there  is  almost  perfect  coincidence  of  the 

translation  vectors  that  provide  robust  interactions  between  graphene  and  metal.  In  the  case  of 

copper substrate small but visible mismatch of translation vectors [36,37] provides weakening of 

graphene-metal  bonds  and  increasing  of  graphene-metal  distance.  The  presence  of  boron 

impurity  leads  changes  of  atomic  positions  of  carbon  atoms  that  eliminate  lattice  mismatch 

between graphene and copper substrate. Thus, boron doping provides increasing of adhesion of 

graphene on copper substrate. 

3.4. Evaluation of Chemical Stability 

In  recent  works  [38,39]  the  high  energy  barriers  for  the  penetration  of  the  oxygen  directly 

through perfect graphene to the copper substrate are discussed. On the other hand, the process of 

9 

 
 
 
oxidation of graphene provides the formation of vacancies in graphene sheets with the extraction 

of CO2 molecule which  can  be  permeable for oxygen.  [40]  We  performed the modeling of the 

step-by-step interaction of boron-doped graphene on copper with molecular oxygen. At the first 

step,  we  checked  the  physisorption  of  an  oxygen  molecule  (Fig.  7a,b).  At  the  second  step,  we 

modeled the adsorption with activation (Fig. 7c,d) and decomposition to the two epoxy groups 

(Fig. 7e,f).  At the last step, we studied the formation of carbon vacancy (Fig. 7g,h) in graphene 

on  copper  in  the  vicinity  of  two  types  of  boron  defects.  The  first  type  is  the  graphitic  type  of 

substitution  when  boron  atom  substitute  carbon  atom  (Fig.  7a).  In  the  case  of  boron  non-

graphitic defect the substitution of the pair of carbon atoms by single boron impurity takes place 

(Fig. 7b).  In the literature, this type of defect discusses is found to be energetically favorable in 

the  case  of  nano-graphenes.  [41]  We  can  also  discuss  this  non-graphitic  boron  defect  as  the 

elimination of Stone-Walles and similar defects when boron impurity substitutes two displaced 

carbon  atoms  and  speculate  that  boron  impurities  sit  on  the  grain  boundaries  with  multiple 

Stone-Walles and similar defects. [42] 

Results of the calculations demonstrate that in contrast to pure free-standing graphene [43] 

and graphene on copper [41] the activation of the oxygen in the vicinity of boron defects is an 

exothermic process. This type of oxygen activation in graphene in the vicinity of boron impurity 

could be the explanation of experimentally detected catalytic properties of boron doped graphene. 

[42-45]  In  the  case  of  graphitic  defects  the  further  decomposition  of  O-O  pair  is  also 

energetically  favorable that could  provide an  oxidation of  graphene in  the vicinity  of  graphitic 

defects.  This oxidation could be a source of minor oxygen contribution to XPS spectra (Fig. 3), 

but the energy cost of formation of vacancy (Fig. 7g) is rather high and close to the values for 

graphite. [39]  

In the case of non-graphitic defect, the decomposition of activated oxygen (Fig. 7d) with 

the  formation  of  two  epoxy  groups  (Fig.  7f)  is  an  exothermic  process  that  corresponds  to  the 

instability of oxidation of graphene in the vicinity of non-graphitic boron defects. Thus despite a 

10 

 
rather  low  energy  cost  of  the  vacancy  formation  (Fig.  7h)  the  instability  of  previous 

configurations  makes  the  formation  of  this  type  of  defect  rather  improbable  at  ambient 

conditions. Thus, based on results of DFT modeling we could conclude that formation of defects 

suitable  for  the  penetration  of  oxygen  atoms  to  the  copper  substrate  is  the  non-preferable 

scenario.  

Figure  8.  Optimized  atomic  structure  of  the  dormation  of  two  hydroxyl  grpups  on  B-doped 

graphene on copper with graphitic (a) and non-graphitic defects (b) corresponding to 4rd step of 

ORR  (see  description  in  text),  and  free  energy  diagram  for  ORR  over  B-doped  graphene  on 

copper, N-doped graphene [46] and platinum [47].

3.5. Modeling of Catalytic Properties 

Described combination of the favorability of molecular oxygen activation with the instability of 

epoxy  groups  in  the  vicinity  of  non-graphitic  boron-defects  makes  this  material  prospective 

candidate  for  catalysis  and  requires  further  evaluation  of  the  catalytic  properties.  For  the 

evaluation of the feasibility of studied systems we performed the calculations of the free energy 

of two electrons oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid media. For the graphene this reactions 

contain five steps [46]: 

1)  Physisorption of molecular oxygen on the surface (Fig. 7a,b), 

2)  Activation of the oxygen molecule (Fig. 7c,d), 

3)  Formation of epoxy groups (Fig 7e,f), 

4)  Interaction of epoxy groups with hydrogen 2Oads + H2 ‚Üí2OHads + 2e- (Fig. 8a,b), 

5)  Interaction of hydroxyl groups with hydrogen 2OHads + H2 ‚Üí2H2O + 2e-. 

The  calculation  of  the  free  energy  was  performed  by  a  previously  developed  method  [47]  for 

platinum  based  catalysis  using  the  formula:  G  =  ŒîEN  -  neU  +  EZP,  where  ŒîEN  is  the  energy 

difference between total energies at N and N+1 step of reaction processes, e the electron charge, 

U  the  equilibrium  potential,  n  is  the  number  of  oxygen  atoms,  and  EZP  the  zero  point  energy 

correction, respectively. The values of U (1.23 V) and zero point energy corrections are the same 

as the ones used in previous works. [46,47] Results of the calculations (Fig. 8c) demonstrate that 

B-doped graphene on copper with graphitic defects have catalytic performance a bit worse that 

nitrogen  doped  graphene  but  better  than  platinum,  and  B-doped  graphene  with  non-graphitic 

defects is a bit worse than platinum but have performance better than other transition metals (see 

discussion  in  Ref.  [47]).  The  combination  of  rather  low  magnitudes  of  Gibbs  free  energies  of 

ORR and stability makes B-doped graphene on copper prospective catalytic material. The further 

progress  in  the  study  of  the  chemical  bonding  in  interfaces  and  its  effect  on  the  stability  of 

electronic  configurations  of  impurity  atoms  in  a  graphene  coating  favorable  for  corrosion 

resistance  and  photocatalytic  activity  is  apparently  associated  with  the  calculation  of  some 

12 

 
quantitative parameters in particular interfacial adhesion of doped graphene and metal substrate. 

It can be realized with help of recently developed bond order-length-strength (BOLS) correlation 

theory [48-51]. 

4. Conclusions 

The  measurements  of  XPS,  Raman  and  OSEE  specters  evidences  that  boron  atoms  substitute 

carbon atoms which provide the homogeneity of graphene layer and prevents to oxidation of Cu-

substrate.  DFT  calculations  confirm  this  conclusion  according  to  which  the  probability  of 

creation of carbon vacancy near graphitic defects is rather low because high energy cost and in 

the  case  of  non-graphitic  defect  despite  favorability  of  oxygen  activation,  the  next  step  in  the 

perforation  of  graphene  is  unstable.  Theoretical  modeling  also  predicts  high  catalytic 

performance of B-doped graphene on copper substrate for oxygen reduction reaction.
