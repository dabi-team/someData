Abstract

The dimension of a graph G is the smallest d for which its vertices can be embedded in d-
dimensional Euclidean space in the sense that the distances between endpoints of edges equal
1 (but there may be other unit distances). Answering a question of Erd˝os and Simonovits
d+2
[Ars Combin. 9 (1980) 229–246], we show that any graph with less than (cid:0)
2 (cid:1) edges has
dimension at most d. Improving their result, we prove that that the dimension of a graph
with maximum degree d is at most d. We show the following Ramsey result: if each edge
of the complete graph on 2d vertices is coloured red or blue, then either the red graph or
the blue graph can be embedded in Euclidean d-space. We also derive analogous results for
embeddings of graphs into the (d

1)-dimensional sphere of radius 1/√2.

(Note that we do not require the edge set of a unit distance graph to contain all unit-distance
pairs.) We say that a graph G is realizable in a subset X of Rd, if there exists a unit distance
graph G′ in Rd on a set of vertices X0 ⊂
X, which is isomorphic to G. We will use this notion
for X = Rd and for X = Sd−1, where Sd−1 is the sphere of radius 1/√2 with center in the origin.

Erd˝os, Harary and Tutte [EHT65] introduced the concept of Euclidean dimension dim G of

a graph G.

Deﬁnition 2. The Euclidean dimension dim G (spherical dimension dimS G) of a graph G is
equal to the smallest integer k such that G is realizable in Rk (on Sk−1

Rk).

The following proposition states that paths and cycles can be realized on S2 in suﬃciently
general position. Note that when a 4-cycle is realized on S2, there is always a pair of non-adjacent
points that are diametrically opposite on the sphere.

Proposition 7. Any graph with maximum degree 2 can be realized on S2 such that the following
two properties hold:

1. For no 3 distinct vertices a, b, and c, does there exist a vertex at distance 1 from all three.

2. No 4 vertices are on a circle, unless the 4 vertices consist of two pairs of diametrically

opposite points coming from two distinct 4-cycles.

This lemma is used in [LSS00] to show that under the same condition, the above random
process gives a realization of the graph such that the points are in general position almost surely.

Theorem 9 ([LSS00, LSS89]). For any graph G = (V, E) that does not contain a complete
bipartite graph on d + 1 vertices, the above random process gives a realization of G such that for
any set of at most d vertices of G, the embedded points are linearly independent.

We now apply Lemma 8 and Theorem 9 to prove Proposition 7.

Proof of Proposition 7. Observe that G is a disjoint union of paths and cycles. If we remove
a vertex from each 4-cycle, we obtain a graph G′ = (V ′, E′) with V ′ =
V that
does not contain a complete bipartite graph on 4 vertices (that is, a 4-cycle or K1,3). Take a
random realization of G′ as described above, and then add back the removed vertices as follows.
If a was removed from the cycle avivjvk with this cyclic order, then embed a as the point
vj
opposite vj. We also denote a by
vj. We claim that this realization satisﬁes the conditions of
the proposition almost surely.

We want to avoid certain conﬁgurations on some small number of vertices. By Lemma 8 it
is always enough to show that if we start with these few vertices then almost surely they do not
form a prohibited conﬁguration.

First we have to see that after adding back the removed vertices, we have a unit distance
realization of G almost surely. By Theorem 9, we have a realization of G′ almost surely, and
for any c with neighbours b and d, we have that b

opposite c. By adding back a =

Proof of Theorem 1. For d = 1 and d = 2, the theorem is trivial. For d = 3, we use Proposition 7
as follows. First we remove vertices of degree 3 in G from V one by one. Let W

circle on S2, there are exactly 2 points at distance 1 from the circle. (They are not necessarily
on the sphere.) For any w
W , we choose one of these two points determined by the circle
through the 3 neighbours of w. It remains to show that there are at most 2 vertices in W that
determine the same circle. First note that at most 2 vertices in W can have the same set of
neighbours, because G does not have K3,3 as a component. Also, if w1 ∈
W have
diﬀerent sets of neighbours, then their neighbours span diﬀerent circles on S2. Otherwise, if the
neighbours of w1 and w2 lie on the same circle C, then by Proposition 7, w1 and w2 have a
common neighbour v on C that lies on a 4-cycle in G[V
W ], so v will have degree 4 in G, a

W has exactly
2 neighbours on each circle, so the set N (w) of d neighbours of w span an aﬃne hyperplane
H not passing through o, hence they lie on a subsphere of Sd−1 of radius less than 1/√2. It
follows that there are exactly 2 points in Rd
Sd−1 at distance 1 from N (w), both on the line
through o orthogonal to H. We choose one of these points to embed w.

Then we add the vertices of W one by one to this embedding. Each vertex w

If some two vertices w1 and w2 from W have diﬀerent sets of neighbours N (w1)

they have diﬀerent pairs of neighbours on at least one of the orthogonal circles, so the aﬃne

assuming that V(d−1)/2 is embedded in S in general position in the sense that no four points of

assumption, embedding V(d−3)/2 is very similar to the embedding of Vd/2 in the even case. First

assumption the aﬃne hyperplane spanned by the set of neighbours N (w) of w does not contain

one of these points to embed w. An argument similar to the one that was used in the even case
shows that there are at most two w

We will also call both a conﬂicting triple and a conﬂicting 4-tuple a conﬂicting set. Note that
any two diﬀerent conﬂicting sets are disjoint. Recall that by the properties of the embedding
of V(d−1)/2 given by Proposition 7, if three vertices on S span a great circle, no vertex from
V(d−1)/2 is embedded in the poles of this circle. It follows that it is suﬃcient for an embedding
to ﬁnd W

1. W is an independent set.

2. If w

4. W contains at most two points of any conﬂicting set (in order to guarantee that the

neighbours of at most two vertices from W can deﬁne the same hyperplane).

Once we ﬁnd such W , we can proceed as in the particular case considered above. In the

remaining part of the proof we construct such W .

Note that the connected components of G[V(d−3)/2] are paths and cycles. We embed paths

of length at most 3 and cycles of length 4 on C. Let
components of G[V(d−3)/2]. It is easy to see the following:

, in a speciﬁc way to be explained below,
a maximal independent WH from each BH, H
and put W := SH∈H WH . First, let us verify that for any choice of W , we can make sure that
the properties 1–3 are satisﬁed. First, clearly, W is an independent set. Second, by the choice
, each vertex in W has degree 2. Third, since each connected
of B in each component H

To conclude the proof, it remains to choose W in such a way that property 4 is also satisﬁed.
Recall that G[M ] is a matching, where M := SH∈H BH, and W
M has exactly 1 vertex from
each edge of G[M ]. The vertices from M may belong to several conﬂicting sets, but, since
diﬀerent conﬂicting sets are disjoint, each vertex belongs to at most one of them.

⊂

We add some new edges to G[M ] to obtain G′ as follows. For each conﬂicting triple, we
add an edge between two of its vertices that were not connected before, and for each conﬂicting
4-tuple we add two vertex disjoint edges that connect two-two of its vertices that were not
connected before. It is clear that ﬁnding such edges is possible. Moreover, the added set of
edges forms a matching. Thus, the graph G′ is a union of two matchings, and therefore does not
have odd cycles. Hence, G′ is bipartite, and it has an independent set W which contains exactly
one vertex from each edge in G′. This is the desired independent set, since no independent set
in G′ intersects a conﬂicting group in more than two vertices.

Lemma 13. If the complement of a graph H on d + k vertices has a matching of size k, then
H can be realized on Sd−1. In particular, the graph of the d-dimensional cross-polytope can be

5 Additional questions

In Theorem 1 we proved that any graph with maximum degree d, except if d = 3 and G has
K3,3 as a component, can be embedded in Rd. We suspect that a slightly stronger statement
can be also true.

Problem 1. Is it true that for d > 3 any graph with maximum degree d, except Kd+1, has
spherical dimension at most d?

For d = 3 the cube (and the cube minus a vertex) cannot be embedded on S2 neither the

}

The lower and upper bound on fD(s) in Theorem 4 are very close, but still it does not give

≥

the exact value of fD(s). We conjecture that the lower bound is sharp.

Problem 2. Is it true that either G or G on 2d + 1 vertices has dimension at most d?
