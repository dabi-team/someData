Abstract

In this work we present the outlines of possible experiments for dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) of ultra-short rel-
ativistic electron bunches produced by the ARES linac, currently under construction at the SINBAD facility (DESY
Hamburg). The experiments are to be performed as part of the Accelerator on a Chip International Program (ACHIP),
funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. At SINBAD we plan to test the acceleration of already pre-
accelerated relativistic electron bunches in laser-illuminated dielectric grating structures. We present outlines of both
the acceleration of ultra-short single bunches, as well as the option to accelerate phase-synchronous sub-fs microbunch
trains. Here the electron bunch is conditioned prior to the injection by interaction with an external laser ﬁeld in an
undulator. This generates a sinusoidal energy modulation that is transformed into periodic microbunches in a subsequent
chicane. The phase synchronization is achieved by driving both the modulation process and the DLA with the same
laser pulse. In addition to the conceptual layouts and plans of the experiments we present start-to-end simulation results
for diﬀerent ARES working points.

1. Introduction

The Accelerator on a Chip International Program
(ACHIP) funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Founda-
tion aims to demonstrate a working prototype of a particle
accelerator on a chip until 2021. Being part of the ACHIP
collaboration DESY will conduct related test experiments
at its SINBAD facility [1]. Here we present plans for the
ﬁrst DLA experiments at SINBAD using electrons pro-
duced by the ARES linac [2, 3]. In addition to the con-
ceptual layout of the experiment we present possible linac
working points and an estimation of the expected results
using a β-matched dual grating type DLA structure [4]
illuminated by a 1 or 2 micron laser.

At the time of this publication three diﬀerent ACHIP-
related experiments are planned to be conducted at ARES.
In the ﬁrst experiment we plan to accelerate already pre-
accelerated relativistic single electron bunches in a laser-
illuminated dielectric grating structure. The goal of the
experiment is to show net-acceleration with low energy
spread growth instead of a broad energy modulation. Since
the ACHIP target periodicity of the DLA structure cur-
rently is 2 µm, achieving a DLA drive laser to electron
phase spread of σφ < π/4 is challenging. At ARES we aim
to produce suﬃciently short bunches using the velocity
bunching technique [5, 6, 7, 8].

In addition to the short bunch lengths the small scale
of the DLA structures consequentely implies the need for
ultra-stable drive laser to electron phase. In order to en-
able stable multi-shot operation we plan to also imple-
ment a technique for phase-synchronous acceleration of
microbunch trains [9]. The main idea of the scheme is to
condition a relatively long bunch in a way that it is trans-
formed into a train of ultra-short microbunches. If done
correctly, these microbunches then populate the periodic
accelerating buckets in a phase stable manner.

The third experiment, which is planned to be conducted
at ARES, aims to test the feasibility of using DLA struc-
tures as transverse deﬂectors (DLA TDS). To this end ei-
ther single bunches or trains of microbunches are injected
in a suitably designed and driven structure. A detailed
study of this topic can be found in these proceedings [10].
Hence it is left out here for brevity.

2. The SINBAD Facility and ARES

The dedicated accelerator R&D facility SINBAD (Short
INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at Desy) is a new
facility at DESY, which is foreseen to host multiple in-
dependent experiments. Two experiments are currently
under construction: ARES (Accelerator Research Exper-
iment at Sinbad) and AXSIS [11]. The ACHIP experi-
ments are planned to be conducted at the ARES linac

Figure 1: The ARES linac.

(see Fig. 1). The ARES linac is a conventional 100 MeV
S-band linac, which is designed to produce sub-fs electron
bunches with charges in the range of 0.5-20 pC. To this end
the electrons are ﬁrst accelerated in a 1.5 cell S-band gun
to 5 MeV with a single bunch repetition rate of up to 50 Hz.
They are then further accelerated in two S-band traveling
wave (TW) structures. In order to compress the bunch the
two TW structures can be used for velocity bunching [5].
Transverse focusing is achieved using multiple solenoids
(cf. Fig. 1). The accelerator is planned to be available for
DLA-related experiments in mid 2019.

In the ﬁrst stage the ACHIP experiments are planned
to be conducted within the 4 m space between the two
TW structures and a matching region, which is needed
for a later energy upgrade of the beamline (see Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3). After the interaction point the beam will be trans-
ported through the matching region to a dipole spectrom-
eter in order to diagnose the energy gain/modulation.

of the ﬁrst ACHIP experiment.

Figure 3: CAD model of the relevant part of the ARES linac beam-
line and the experimental area, which is foreseen for the ACHIP-
related experiments.

3. External Injection of Single Bunches

The ﬁrst DLA-related experiments at SINBAD are
planned to be based on the external
injection of sin-
gle ultra-short electron bunches into a grating-type DLA
structure. In the current design both the cathode of the
RF-gun and the DLA are driven by the same laser system
(see Fig. 2). Since the DLA is foreseen to be operated
with a laser wavelength of 2 µm, the initial 1028 nm beam
is split and converted on the one hand to 257 nm (fourth
harmonic generation) and on the other to 2 µm (optical
parametric ampliﬁer). This setup has the advantage of in-
trinsic synchronization between the cathode and the DLA
laser beams. The relative electron to laser phase jitter is
hence mainly given by the RF-induced beam arrival time
jitter contribution.

3.1. Working Point

Tab. 1 shows the beam parameters at the interaction
point for a simulated ARES working point. It is based on
a 100 fs rms laser pulse length on the cathode (Gaussian
time proﬁle) and optimized for minimal bunch length us-
ing the velocity bunching technique. The simulation was
performed using ASTRA [12] including space charge.

3.2. Simulation

Simulations were performed using a combination of
ASTRA and VSim 7.2 [13]. The procedure combines the
simulation of the ARES working point up to the DLA
(ASTRA-based) and the DLA interaction (VSim-based).
Any possible interaction of the electrons with the dielectric
material is currently not taken into account. The beam is
assumed to be collimated just upstream of the DLA. Fig-
ure 4 shows the energy spectrum of the transmitted part
before and after the DLA interaction respectively. In the
simulation an accelerating gradient of 1 GeV/m over 150
periods was assumed. In reality this will depend a lot on
the achievable laser parameters at the DLA, which are not
ﬁxed at the time of this publication. As the electrons are
already highly relativistic dephasing is not an issue here.
The results show that ∼80 % of the collimated core of the
bunch is accelerated.

energy of the incoming electrons is low enough this trans-
formation can be achieved by a simple drift, but in case
of highly relativistic electrons a dispersive section such as
a magnetic chicane has to be used. Once the train of mi-
crobunches is formed it can be transported and injected
into the DLA structure.
If both the modulator and the
DLA are driven by the same laser and the relative phase
jitter between the two arms is negligible, intrinsic phase
synchronisation between the microbunches and the DLA
ﬁeld can be achieved. Any laser to electron bunch phase
jitter in the DLA caused by the laser system or the elec-
tron time of arrival is compensated due to the fact that the
intrabunch phase of the microbunch train is also shifted by
the same amount. In other words: The modulator acts as
a focusing device in the time/phase domain. Any resid-
ual laser to electron phase jitter can now be attributed to
the mean electron energy (via R56) and the phase jitter
between the two laser arms.

4.1. Integration

In [9] we have already studied a theoretical extension
of the ARES beamline in order to show the feasibility
of the concept in the 2 µm DLA context. A clear en-
hancement of the accelerated fraction in the modulator
on case was conﬁrmed in simulation compared to the
non-modulated beam. Preliminary start to end simula-
tions based on ASTRA, GENESIS 1.3 [17] and VSim 7.2
showed an achievable microbunch train with microbunches
as short as (699 ± 88) attoseconds FWHM with a spacing
of (2.00 ± 0.01) µm in its 6 period core.

In order to keep the setup at SINBAD as small and af-
fordable as possible we aim to use a scaled down version of
the setup, which ﬁts into the planned target chamber. Cur-
rent plans foresee repurposing components that have al-
ready been used at SLAC (NLCTA) [14]. The components
comprise a miniature undulator, permanent magnetic chi-
cance and permanent magnetic quadrupole (PMQ) triplet.
Tab. 2 shows the relevant parameters of the components.

4.2. Simulation

The undulator was originally designed for an 800 nm
drive laser and 60 MeV. The wavelength of emitted undu-

bunch before (left) and after (right) the DLA interaction (mean en-
ergy gain of ∼ 300 keV). The bins are chosen according to the ex-
pected minimum energy resolution of the spectrometer (∼ 10−4).

4. Phase-Synchronous Acceleration

In the previous section a ﬁrst possible experiment in-
volving single bunches was described. As has been stated
above achieving an energy spectrum as shown in Fig. 4
over many conscutive shots assumes a very stable bunch
arrival time at the DLA. In order to achieve reasonably
low energy spread growth due to arrival time jitter, the
rms phase stability needs to be < π/4, which translates
to < 1 fs for a DLA period length of 2 µm. This is a very
challenging goal, as the design phase stability of ARES is
currently given as < 10 fs rms.

In order to tackle this problem, we want to adapt a
scheme that has already been successfully used in other
contexts [14, 15] to our DLA case. The main idea of the
scheme is to condition a relatively long bunch in a way that
it is transformed into a train of ultra- short microbunches.
If done correctly, these microbunches then populate the
periodic accelerating buckets in a phase stable manner.
Fig. 5 shows a sketch of how the scheme works. The in-

coming long electron bunch is modulated inside an undu-
lator, into which a laser pulse is colinearly injected in a
way that it overlaps with the electron bunch in time and
space. The external laser ﬁeld consequently imprints an
energy modulation onto the electron distribution, which

where λu is the undulator period and γ the normalized
energy of the electrons. Since the pulse energy of our cath-
ode laser system is limited and the conversion from 1 µm
to 2 µm involves substantial losses (eﬃciency ∼ 0.2), we
currently plan to perform the microbunching at 1 µm. Us-
ing Eq. 2 hence yields a resonant energy between 50.5 and
75.5 MeV depending on the adjustable K of the undulator.
In order to achieve as short microbunches as possible the
relative energy spread at the modulator needs to be as low
as possible [9]. In our case in order to achieve ≤ π/4 bunch
length, ∆γ/γ0 ≤ 5.7·10−4. Also the energy chirp should be
as low as possible in order ensure even spacing between the
individual microbunches. Tab. 3 shows a possible ARES
working point. For this study we use ELEGANT [18] to

in order to accomodate the <2 µm channel width. Fig. 7

5. Conclusion

We have presented two experiments, which are planned
to be conducted at the SINBAD facility using electrons
produced by the ARES linac. The current schedule fore-
sees ﬁrst tests using single bunches in mid 2019. As a sec-
ond stage we aim to show phase-synchronous acceleration
