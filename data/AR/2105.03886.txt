ABSTRACT

Using the data on magnetic ﬁeld maps and continuum intensity for Solar Cycles 23 and 24, we explored 100 active regions
(ARs) that produced M5.0 or stronger ﬂares. We focus on the presence/absence of the emergence of magnetic ﬂux in these ARs
2-3 days before the strong ﬂare onset. We found that 29 ARs in the sample emerged monotonously amidst quiet-Sun area. A major
emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux within pre-existing AR yielding the formation of a complex ﬂare-productive conﬁguration
was observed in another 24 cases. For 30 ARs, an insigniﬁcant (in terms of the total magnetic ﬂux of pre-existing AR) emergence
of a new magnetic ﬂux within the pre-existing magnetic conﬁguration was observed; for some of them the emergence resulted
in a formation of a conﬁguration with a small 𝛿-sunspot. 11 out of 100 ARs exhibited no signatures of magnetic ﬂux emergence
during the entire interval of observation. In 6 cases the emergence was in progress when the AR appeared on the Eastern
limb, so that the classiﬁcation and timing of emergence were not possible. We conclude that the recent ﬂux emergence is not a
necessary and/or suﬃcient condition for strong ﬂaring of an AR. The ﬂux emergence rate of analysed here ﬂare-productive ARs
was compared with that for ﬂare-quiet ARs analysed in our previous studies. We revealed that the ﬂare-productive ARs tend to
display faster emergence than the ﬂare-quiet ones.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most of the solar ﬂares emanate from active regions (ARs) – sites
where strong magnetic ﬁelds penetrate from the convection zone to
the solar atmosphere. It is widely accepted that the energy released
during solar ﬂares is stored in the form of free magnetic energy
caused by non-potentiality of magnetic ﬁelds (e.g. Melrose 1991;
Schrĳver et al. 2005; Fisher et al. 2015).

the mag-
netic ﬁeld (Mayﬁeld & Lawrence 1985; Sammis, Tang, & Zirin
2000; Toriumi et al. 2017,
to mention a few). For example,
Guo, Lin, & Deng (2014) analysed 3334 ARs observed between
1983 and 2011 and found that 88% of X-class ﬂares were produced
by ARs with 𝛽𝛾𝛿 conﬁguration according to the Mount Wilson clas-
siﬁcation (Hale et al. 1919; Künzel 1960, 1965). Recall that in a
𝛿-sunspot two umbrae of opposite magnetic polarities are located
within a common penumbra and separated by less than 2 degrees
(Künzel 1960). Note, however, that Zirin & Liggett (1987) argued
that a presence of any 𝛿-conﬁguration is not suﬃcient for produc-
tion of a strong ﬂare and both polarities within the 𝛿-spot must be
“substantial” for that. Flare-productive ARs also frequently display
patterns of strong, high-gradient magnetic ﬁelds along the highly-
sheared polarity inversion line (e.g. Zirin & Liggett 1987; Schrĳver

2007). A comprehensive description of morphology and other prop-
erties of ﬂare-productive ARs can be found in the recent review by
Toriumi & Wang (2019) and references therein.

Since ARs with 𝛿-spot are the most plausible candidates to ensure
strong ﬂares, a lot of attention has been paid to the formation of such
magnetic structures from both observational and theoretical points
of view. Thus, Zirin & Liggett (1987) considered the formation and
evolution of 21 ﬂare-productive 𝛿-spot groups observed at the Big
Bear Solar Observatory. They concluded that there exists three types
of 𝛿-spots formation. First, 𝛿-spots may be formed as a result of
simultaneous emergence of one or several magnetic dipoles at one
place. Such structures are very compact and exhibit a large umbra.
The second type is the emergence of a new dipole in the penumbra of
a large pre-existing spot. The size of the newly-emerged dipole must
be comparable to that of pre-existing spot in order to produce strong
ﬂares. The third type of 𝛿-spot formation is the collision of the leading
part of one dipole with the following part of another dipole during the
growth of both dipoles. The 𝛿-spots of this type are less ﬂare-proliﬁc
as compared to the aforementioned ones. Zirin & Liggett (1987) also
stated that, once formed, the polarities of a 𝛿-spot never separate. In
addition, the orientation of the opposite polarities in 𝛿-spots often
disobey Hale’s polarity law (Hale & Nicholson 1925).

Toriumi et al. (2017) analysed the morphology and other proper-
ties of 29 ARs observed between 2010 and 2016. Each AR produced
at least one ﬂare stronger than M5.0 level when it was located within
the 45-degrees distance from the central meridian. More than 80%

of ARs exhibited a 𝛿-structure and at least 3 ARs disobeyed Hale’s
polarity law. The authors proposed four scenarios for the formation
of ﬂare-productive AR:

(i) A complex compact AR with a 𝛿-spot is formed via emergence
of a single or several magnetic dipoles. The distinguishing feature
of these ARs is a long polarity inversion line that extends through
the entire AR. The formation of these ARs might be associated
with the emergence of a highly-twisted magnetic ﬂux bundle with
kink instability (e.g. Linton, Longcope, & Fisher 1996; Tanaka 1991;
Knizhnik, Linton, & DeVore 2018). The possible anti-Hale orienta-
tion of such ARs was explained in a simulation of twisted ﬂux tube
emergence by Fan et al. (1999). This scenario resembles the ﬁrst type
of 𝛿-spot following to Zirin & Liggett (1987). In total, 11 of 29 ARs
were attributed by Toriumi et al. (2017) to this category.

(ii) A complex magnetic structure forms as a result of a new
magnetic dipole emergence in the close vicinity of the pre-existing
spot. The newly-emerged dipole, labelled “satellite” by Toriumi et al.
(2017), is usually smaller than the pre-existing spot. This sce-
nario refers to the second type of 𝛿-spot formation proposed by
Zirin & Liggett (1987) and 15 out of 29 ARs belonged to this cat-
egory. Toriumi et al. (2017) suggested that the minor magnetic ﬂux
bundle might be connected to the main spot below the surface or
might be trapped by the main tube during its raise through the con-
vection zone. This case, as well as all other proposed scenarios, was
successfully modelled by Toriumi & Takasao (2017), see also simu-
lations by Jouve, Brun, & Aulanier (2018); Cheung et al. (2019).
“quadrupole”

in
(type
Zirin & Liggett 1987), when two magnetic dipoles
emerge
close to each other simultaneously and the following spot of the
western dipole approaches to the leading spot of the eastern dipole
forming the common penumbra. An excellent example of such a
structure is the well-studied NOAA AR 11158 (e.g. Sun et al. 2012;
Vemareddy, Ambastha, & Maurya 2012). The dipoles forming the
AR might be two emerging parts of the same magnetic ﬂux tube:
the rising Ω-tube might split into two segments below the surface
(Toriumi et al. 2014), or we observe two rising Ω-segments of a
coherent emerging tube (Fang & Fan 2015; Toriumi & Takasao
2017; Syntelis et al. 2019).

so-called

(iii) The

scenario

(iv) A strong ﬂare occurs between two close ARs (“inter-AR”
event as labelled by Toriumi et al. 2017). This case is similar to the
“quadrupole” scenario with an exception that in this case the inter-
acting ARs are supposed to be disconnected below the photosphere.
There were only two inter-AR events (NOAA ARs 11944 and 12173)
in the sample analysed by Toriumi et al. (2017).

A reasonable inference from the above review seems to be a key
role of the magnetic ﬂux emergence some time prior to a strong ﬂare.
After the thorough study published by Schrĳver et al. (2005) this hy-
pothesis became a widely accepted concept. The authors analysed 95
ARs and concluded that non-potentiality in the corona (i.e. electric
currents feeding a ﬂare) is driven by a complex and large emergence
of the magnetic ﬂux. The electric currents emerging with the mag-
netic ﬂux presumably decay within 10-30 hours, therefore, a solar
ﬂare is expected to occur within this time interval.

Although the emergence of magnetic ﬂux is studied extensively in
conjunction with the appearance of strong ﬂares and eruptions (see,
e.g., a review by Schrĳver 2009), much less attention is paid to the
ﬂux emergence rate of ﬂare-productive ARs. Numerical simulations
predict relatively high values of the ﬂux emergence rate when consid-
ering the emergence of a highly-twisted magnetic tube presumably
forming 𝛿-spot due to kink instability (e.g. Toriumi & Takasao 2017;
Knizhnik, Linton, & DeVore 2018). As for observations, Giovanelli

(1939) probably was the ﬁrst one who showed that emerging ARs
with higher area growth rate (that is equivalent to higher ﬂux emer-
gence rate) exhibit higher probability of ﬂare occurrence.

In the present study, we aim to re-examine the statement
to a strong ﬂare there is always a large emer-
that prior
gence of new magnetic ﬂux. Note that
in our previous paper
(Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Kutsenko 2021), we moved from emer-
gence to ﬂaring. Namely, we detected all ARs emerged on the solar
disc between 2010 and 2017. Out of all detected 243 ARs, there were
only 34 ARs with noticeable ﬂaring and only one of them produced
X-class ﬂare (NOAA 11158), so that the comparison between emer-
gence and ﬂaring was possible only for a scanty data sample. We
found that the faster an AR emerges the higher the ﬂare index is (the
Pearson correlation coeﬃcient reaches 0.74).

In contrast to that study, in the present work we proceed in oppo-
site direction: from ﬂaring to emergence. We selected ARs (observed
between 1996 and 2017) that produced at least one ﬂare stronger than
M5.0 level and investigated the pre-ﬂare behaviour of the AR’s mag-
netic ﬂux. Our goal was to reveal (i) whether strong solar ﬂares are
always preceded by magnetic ﬂux emergence and (ii) whether ﬂare-
productive ARs exhibit higher ﬂux emergence rates as compared
to ﬂare-quiet ARs. We hope that this study will contribute to the
problem of solar ﬂare predictions.

2 DATA

The

and Magnetic

the Helioseismic

second source of magnetic ﬁeld data
Imager

Since our goal is to analyse AR magnetic ﬂux variations associated
with solar ﬂares, we need uninterruptible data on AR magnetic ﬁelds
available at relatively high cadence. The ﬁrst data source we utilized
(1996-2010) was the Michelson Doppler Imager on board the Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI, Scherrer et al. 1995).
SOHO/MDI is a full-disc ﬁltergraph that observes the photospheric
Ni i 6768 Å spectral line at four wavelength positions. The magnetic
ﬁeld is proportional to the diﬀerence between the spectral line centres
in right- and left-circular polarizations. The derived magnetic ﬁeld
maps are 1024×1024 pixels line-of-sight magnetograms with the
pixel size of 2×2 arcsec2. The data are available at 96 minute cadence.
(2010-2017)
was
(Schou et al.
2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI,
Pesnell, Thompson, & Chamberlin 2012). SDO/HMI observes the
Fe i 6173 Å photospheric spectral line at six wavelength positions to
derive solar magnetic ﬁeld maps. The size of the full-disc maps is
4096×4096 pixels with the pixel size of 0.5×0.5 arcsec2. Although
the SDO/HMI data of the full magnetic ﬁeld vector are available, we
decided to use SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetograms of 12 minute
cadence due to the following reasons. First, to treat SOHO/MDI and
SDO/HMI data by the same procedures to ensure the homogeneity of
the derived magnetic ﬂux values. Second, to ensure the consistency
of the data reduction techniques applied in this work and in our pre-
vious works on AR emergence (Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Pevtsov
2019; Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Kutsenko 2021) in order to perform
the comparison of the results. The SDO/HMI algorithm for the line-
of-sight magnetic ﬁeld calculations is similar to that for SOHO/MDI
data.

For the analysis we selected ARs that produced M5.0 or stronger
ﬂares while the AR was located inside the longitudinal interval (-35,
+65) ◦. We suppose that the AR magnetic ﬂux can be reliably esti-
mated then the AR is no farther then 60◦ from the central meridian.
To ensure 2-3 days of reliable ﬂux measurements before the ﬂare

onset, we have to shift the Eastern longitudinal limit to the West by
approximately 25◦.

For each AR we compiled the data cube of magnetograms span-
ning the time interval of the AR’s passage across the solar disc.
For emerging ARs we also tracked the quiet-Sun area where the
AR to be appeared. Prior to calculation of the total unsigned mag-
netic ﬂux, each magnetogram was 𝜇-corrected for the projection
(Leka, Barnes, & Wagner 2017). The magnetic ﬂux density in each
magnetogram pixel was divided by the cosine of the angle 𝜇 be-
tween the line-of-sight and the vector pointing from the centre of the
Sun to the pixel. According to Leka, Barnes, & Wagner (2017) the
𝜇-correction in each pixel allows us to improve an estimation of the
total unsigned magnetic ﬂux from line-of-sight magnetograms.

The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux was calculated as Φ = Í |𝐵𝑖 |Δ𝑠𝑖,
where 𝐵𝑖 and Δ𝑠𝑖 are the 𝜇-corrected magnetic ﬂux density and
area of 𝑖𝑡 ℎ pixel, respectively. The summation was performed over
pixels where the magnetic ﬂux density exceeded the triple noise level
𝐵𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒. The noise level is 𝐵𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 = 6 Mx cm-2 for SDO/HMI and
𝐵𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 ≈ 18 Mx cm-2 for SOHO/MDI magnetograms (Liu et al.
2012). Consequently, the threshold 𝐵𝑡 ℎ was set to 18 Mx cm-2 for
SDO/HMI and to 50 Mx cm-2 for SOHO/MDI data. The uncertainty
of the calculated unsigned magnetic ﬂux was estimated as Φ𝑒𝑟𝑟 𝑜𝑟 =
𝑛𝐵𝑡 ℎΔ𝑠, where 𝑛 is the number of pixel over which the calculation
of magnetic ﬂux was performed.

Using of SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI data allowed us to span
Solar Cycles 23 and 24 covering the time interval between 1996
and 2017 and to get large sample of ﬂare-productive ARs. How-
ever, the instruments use diﬀerent spectral lines and have diﬀerent
spatial resolutions. Therefore, in order to get consistent homoge-
neous estimations of the magnetic ﬂux and ﬂux emergence rate, we
performed a cross-calibration between SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI.
Fig. 1 shows SOHO/MDI versus SDO/HMI total magnetic ﬂuxes for
randomly selected ten ARs observed between 2010 May and 2011
February. Each point in the plot corresponds to the magnetic ﬂux of
a particular AR (coded with diﬀerent colours) at moments with 96
minute cadence. SOHO/MDI and almost co-temporary SDO/HMI
magnetograms of the same region of solar surface were used to cal-
culate the data points. The linear ﬁtting of the distribution yields the
relationship between SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI magnetic ﬂuxes
Φ𝑀 𝐷𝐼 = 1.42 Φ𝐻 𝑀 𝐼 . The slope of the ﬁtting line 1.42 is consistent
with the value 1.40 by Liu et al. (2012) who compared magnetic ﬂux
densities in SOHO/MDI and processed SDO/HMI magnetograms.
In the rest of this work, SOHO/MDI magnetic ﬂuxes are divided by
a factor of 1.42 to get better consistency with SDO/HMI data.

The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux variations of eight ARs are shown
in Fig. 2. Diurnal oscillations of the magnetic ﬂux in panels (c),(f),
and (h) are caused by well-known artefacts of SDO/HMI instrument
(e.g. Liu et al. 2012; Kutsenko & Abramenko 2016). We did not take
any precautions against this artefact since its inﬂuence on the derived
values is minor. Error bars in each panel show typical errors of the
magnetic ﬂux measurements.

For AR with well pronounced emergence stage, the linear ﬁtting
of increasing and maximum patterns of the magnetic ﬂux curve by
a linear piecewise continuous function (?) was performed (green
lines in panels (a)–(d) and (g) of Fig. 2). The ﬁtting function had
two segments one of which (left-handed one in Fig. 2(a-d, g) can
have an arbitrary slope. The second segment had to be horizontal.
The slope of the left-handed segment yields information on the ﬂux
emergence rate, 𝑅𝑎 𝑣, in an AR. The error of the ﬂux emergence rate
measurements was evaluated as the uncertainty of the slope of the
linear ﬁt. The level of the second segment corresponded to the peak
magnetic ﬂux, Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥, of the AR. Note that this ﬁtting was performed

observed in both magnetograms and continuum images, and (ii) the
amount of the newly emerged ﬂux exceeded the uncertainty of the
magnetic ﬂux estimation.

Vertical lines in Fig. 2 denote the moments when M (yellow)
and/or X (red) class ﬂares occurred in the AR. The data on soft
X-ray ﬂare magnitudes taken by Geostationary Operational Envi-
ronmental Satellites (GOES) were retrieved from National Centers
For Environmental Information of NOAA1.

To quantify the ﬂaring productivity of an AR, we calculated a ﬂare

index (FI) introduced in Abramenko (2005):

FI = (100𝑆 (𝑋) + 10𝑆 ( 𝑀 ) + 1.0𝑆 (𝐶) + 0.1𝑆 (𝐵) )/𝜏,

(1)

𝑁 𝑗
𝑖=1 𝐼 𝑗

where 𝑆 ( 𝑗) = Í
𝑖 is the sum of GOES magnitudes and 𝑁 𝑗 is the
number of ﬂares of a certain class, 𝜏 is the total time interval of AR
observation in days. For ARs that passed across the solar disc from
the Eastern to the Western limb 𝜏 was set to a half period of solar
rotation 𝜏 = 13.5 days. For emerging ARs 𝜏 was set to the actual
interval of AR presence on the disc.

Beside magnetograms and continuum images, we also utilized
UV images acquired by the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
(Delaboudinière et al. 1995) on board SOHO and by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (Lemen et al. 2012) on board SDO to analyse
magnetic connections and to locate ﬂares within ARs.

(stronger than M5.0), which were observed between 1996 July and
2017 September. Actually, we revealed that the total number of ARs

3.1 Relationship between ﬂaring and ﬂux emergence

A thorough analysis of the magnetic ﬂux variations, magnetic ﬁeld
maps, and continuum images of ﬂare-productive AR in our set al-
lowed us to conclude that these ARs can be separated into four
subsets. These subsets are not directly related to the AR morphology
as in Zirin & Liggett (1987) or Toriumi et al. (2017). ARs in diﬀer-
ent subsets exhibit diﬀerent behavior of the magnetic ﬂux emergence
prior or during the strongest ﬂares. We will refer to this behavior as
the type of emergence and the assigned type for each AR is shown
in column 10 of Table A1. These types are as follows:

(i) Type I: A complex magnetic structure forming a ﬂare-
productive AR emerges amidst a quiet-Sun area. The total magnetic
ﬂux increases monotonously without signiﬁcant interruptions in the
growth. Usually the magnetic structure with 𝛿-spots is formed as a
result of emergence of multiple interacting magnetic dipoles. Exam-
ples of the total magnetic ﬂux variations of such ARs are shown in
panels (a), (b), and (g) of Fig. 2. A strong ﬂaring (M-class ﬂares) may
start during the initial phases of emergence as in Fig. 2g. However,
most commonly M- and X-class ﬂares occur as the AR reaches its
peak magnetic ﬂux (Fig. 2a, b). NOAA ARs 11429 and 11158 can
be attributed to this type. The number of ARs assigned to this type
of emergence behavior was 29 out of 100.

(ii) Type II: A complex magnetic structure is formed as a result of
emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux within the area of a pre-existing
AR. Moreover, the unsigned magnetic ﬂux of the newly injected
magnetic structure exceeds the uncertainty of the total magnetic ﬂux
measurements, i.e. a considerable amount of a new magnetic ﬂux (as
compared to the magnetic ﬂux of the pre-existing structure) appears
on the surface. In most cases, the AR exhibits no signiﬁcant ﬂaring
prior to the emergence of the new ﬂux.

Examples of the magnetic ﬂux evolution of these type of ARs
are shown in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 2. The magnetic ﬂux of an
AR remains nearly constant at a certain non-zero level during the
initial phase of observations. Then, the total unsigned ﬂux increases
as a result of a new emergence. The ﬂaring activity of the AR in-
creases signiﬁcantly as well. Probably, the most well-known ARs
of this type are NOAA ARs 10930 and 12673. NOAA AR 10930
observed in 2006 December exhibited strong activity near the East-
ern limb. It produced two X-class ﬂares and started to decay as a
unipolar sunspot surrounded by small magnetic features of both po-
larities. An emergence of a fast-rotating satellite occurred near the
main polarity spot (e.g. Zhang, Li, & Song 2007). The formation of
a highly-sheared 𝛿-sunspot led to the production of two more X-
class ﬂares (e.g. Inoue et al. 2012). NOAA AR 12673 showed up in
the Eastern limb in 2017 August as a decaying ﬂare-quiet unipolar
sunspot. An intense emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux around the
sunspot started on 2017 September 03 and lasted for several days.
The AR produced a series of M- and X-class ﬂares including the
strongest X9.3-class ﬂare of Solar Cycle 24.

The evolution of continuum intensity and longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld of one more AR of this type, namely NOAA AR 09236, is shown
in Fig. 3. The variations of the magnetic ﬂux are shown in Fig. 2d.
The AR was a ﬂare-quiet bipolar magnetic structure prior to 2000
November 22 (Fig. 3a). A quite intense emergence began around the
leading polarity on this date (Fig. 3b). An interesting feature of the
emergence is the formation of a circular symmetrical rim of moving
magnetic features around the leading sunspot (Fig. 3c). Three X-class
ﬂares occurred in the AR during the emergence, which can be seen
in Fig. 2d. Two more X-class ﬂares were produced by the formed
𝛿-sunspot (Fig. 3d, see also Park et al. 2013).

For ARs of type II, in the 6-th column of Table A1 (in addition to

Flux emergence prior to ﬂares

5

the peak magnetic ﬂux, Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥), we also list the AR magnetic ﬂux,
Φ𝑚𝑖𝑛, measured prior to the observed emergence onset. There are 24
ARs of type II in our sample. In several cases, when an emerging AR
appeared at the Eastern limb, we were unable to determine whether
this AR emerges amidst a quiet-Sun area or an additional emergence
occurs in the “old” AR. Therefore, these ARs were assigned to a
mixed type I/II. However, the number of such events is only 6 and we
suppose that this uncertainty did not aﬀect the results signiﬁcantly.
(iii) Type III: Although a fact of emergence is observed within
a pre-existing magnetic structure, the ﬂux injection is negligible as
compared to the total magnetic ﬂux of the magnetic structure. This
type resembles the “spot-satellite” scenario in Toriumi et al. (2017).
Typical variations of the total magnetic ﬂux of type III ARs are
shown in panels (e) and (f) in Fig. 2. Insigniﬁcant (as compared to
the uncertainty) injection of a new magnetic ﬂux prior to ﬂares can
be seen in the ﬁgures.

We assume that the emergence of the satellite may play various
roles in the ﬂaring. First, the emergence may result in the formation
of a small/moderate 𝛿-sunspot that will produce a strong ﬂare. A
large amount of the newly-injected ﬂux is not necessary to produce
a X-class ﬂare. For instance, NOAA AR 12017 exhibited one of
the lowest in our sample magnitude of the total magnetic ﬂux of
about 8×1021 (Fig. 2e). The emergence of 1×1021 Mx of additional
magnetic ﬂux yielded the appearance of a compact small 𝛿-sunspot
that resulted in X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 March 29 at 17:48 UT (Fig. 4).

Second, we suppose that the emergence of a small magnetic dipole
within a pre-existing AR may trigger a ﬂare. And the third possibility
is that such an emergence will be irrelevant to the oncoming ﬂare.
Unfortunately, modern data and numerical resources are not enough
to make an adequate decision on the consequences of a small mag-
netic ﬂux appearance. As an example, let us consider the case of
NOAA AR 11944. Emergence of a new magnetic structure in this
AR is shown in Fig. 5. The AR exhibited complex mixed-polarity
structure in the following part. Two strong ﬂares (M7.2 and X1.2)
were produced by the AR on 2014 January 07. Our focus is the
inter-AR X1.2 ﬂare between the strong coherent leading part and the
dispersed decayed following part of the neighbor AR 11943. A small
magnetic dipole started to emerge between the leading and following
parts of NOAA AR 11944 on 2014 January 06 (shown by red arrow
in the upper panels of Fig. 5). The Eastern footpoint of the X1.2-
ﬂare ribbon was located 10-20 Mm away from the newly-emerged
dipole (white arrow in the lower panel (c) in Fig. 5). The dipole could
play some role in the triggering of the ﬂare, however, without addi-
tional information from numerical simulations and magnetographic
measurements on higher levels it seems to impossible to decide.

Similar emergence of a new magnetic dipole was observed in
the largest and one of the most ﬂare-productive AR of Solar Cycle
24 NOAA 12192. Again, to determine the exact inﬂuence of the
emerging structures on the triggering of ﬂares is impossible. In our
opinion, in a certain number of cases these emerging structures do
trigger strong ﬂares. In total, 30 out of 100 ARs were identiﬁed as
type III ARs.

(iv) Type IV: No clear signatures of emergence were observed
during the entire interval of observations (i.e., at least several days
prior to the strongest ﬂare occurrence). An example of magnetic ﬂux
variations of type IV NOAA AR 11520 is shown Fig. 2h. The AR
exhibited almost constant magnetic ﬂux. Insigniﬁcant increase of the
magnetic ﬂux is obvious at the beginning of the interval. However,
we attribute this increase to the projection eﬀect: no signatures of
emergence were observed in the magnetograms or continuum images
at that time. The X-class ﬂare occurred three days after that magnetic
increase. Moreover, ﬂares may occur during the decaying phase of the

AR evolution, see the second (right-hand) X-class ﬂare in Fig. 2g.
Magnetograms of several type IV ARs are shown in Fig. 6. Each
magnetogram shows the presence of interacting opposite magnetic
polarities within the AR. Mutual motions of sunspots resulting in
shearing of magnetic ﬁeld and formation of 𝛿-sunspots were observed
in these ARs. There are 11 type IV ARs in our sample. We must
conclude that, once formed by any suitable mechanism, an AR with
a substantial 𝛿-structure is prone to keep the high ﬂaring potential as
long as the 𝛿-structure exists: no additional emergence is required to
maintain the high ﬂare activity.

3.2 The ﬂux emergence rate of ﬂare-productive ARs

As it was mentioned above, numerical simulations suggest highly
twisted magnetic ﬂux bundles forming 𝛿-sunspot to exhibit high
ﬂux emergence rate during emergence from the convection zone
(e.g. Toriumi & Takasao 2017; Knizhnik, Linton, & DeVore 2018,
and references therein). Most of ARs in our sample contain 𝛿-
sunspots. For type I and type II ARs the data allow us to de-
rive the ﬂux emergence rate 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 using the technique presented in
Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Pevtsov (2019). The relationship between
the peak magnetic ﬂux, Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥, and ﬂux emergence rate for these ARs
is shown in Fig. 7. For type II ARs (blue circles), the background
ﬂux Φ𝑚𝑖𝑛 was subtracted before plotting.

Data points from Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Pevtsov (2019) for
400 emerging dipoles are overplotted with grey circles in Fig. 7.
These dipoles are ephemeral and active regions observed between
2010 and 2017, and majority of them were ﬂare-quiet: only 34
of those ARs exhibited ﬂare index exceeding unity. Several ARs,
presented in both the samples (in Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Pevtsov
(2019) and in the sample used in this work) were counted once.

In Solar Cycle 24 there was one peculiar active region with very
high and stable ﬂux and very low ﬂaring activity. Data for such an
AR may allow us to estimate the upper level of the ﬂux emergence
rate for ﬂare-quiet AR. This is NOAA AR 12674. EUV images taken
by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO, Kaiser et al. 2008; Howard et al.
2008) allowed us to reveal that this AR started to emerge on the
far-side of the Sun on 2017 August 26. By 2017 August 30, the
AR was visible near the Eastern limb ( E85) and exhibited the peak
magnetic ﬂux of approximately 4.1×1022 Mx. We estimated the ﬂux
emergence rate to be of about 3.4×1020 Mx h−1. We overplotted this
data point in Fig. 7 with a green star. The horizontal dashed line in
the ﬁgure marks the upper level of the ﬂux emergence rate for all low-
ﬂaring ARs, including the largest (in sense of ﬂux) one, AR 12674.
Above this level only strong-ﬂaring ARs are observed (however, not
all of them).

In general, the diagram in Fig. 7 demonstrates that new data (colour
circles) are consistent with the published data (grey circles): the di-
agram is now extended toward higher magnitudes and the peak total
unsigned ﬂux tends to be in a direct proportion with the ﬂux emer-
gence rate. Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient from the combined data
set of N=471 events is 0.80+0.03
−0.04. The slope of the linear regression
is the same, 0.48±0.02. This result indicates that the relationship
between Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 and 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 found here does not depend on the sample
selection.

Fig. 8 shows the relationship between ﬂare index and peak mag-
netic ﬂux of all ARs in our sample (left panel) and the relationship
between ﬂare index and ﬂux emergence rate of ARs of types I and
II (right panel). In both panels we also overplotted data points on
ARs (black circles) analysed in Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Kutsenko

MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2021)

(2021). These data points are 34 emerging ARs with the ﬂare index
exceeding unity.

The left panel in Fig. 8 conﬁrms a well-known relationship between
the peak magnetic ﬂux and ﬂare productivity of ARs: larger ARs are
capable of producing stronger ﬂares. Pearson’s linear correlation
coeﬃcient of the distribution is 𝑟 = 0.70+0.06
−0.08, where the conﬁdence
interval is calculated for 95% conﬁdence level. Although larger ARs
tend to produce stronger ﬂares, this relationship is hardly appropriate
for reliable ﬂare forecast. Taking into account logarithmic scale on
both axes of the plot in the left panel of Fig. 8, we may conclude that
ARs of similar peak magnetic ﬂux may exhibit ﬂare indices varying
in an order of magnitude. High peak magnetic ﬂux is a favourable
but not necessary parameter of a ﬂare-productive AR. For instance,
NOAA AR 09087 exhibited relatively high peak magnetic ﬂux of
about 5.5×1022 Mx. The strongest ﬂare occurred in this AR was a
M6.4 event on 2000 July 19 (see column 7 in Table A1). Meanwhile,
relatively weak NOAA ARs 09511 and 12017 with Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 ≈ 9 × 1021
Mx produced X1.2 and X1.0 ﬂares on 2001 June 23 and 2014 March
29, respectively.

The relationship between ﬂare index and the ﬂux emergence rate
shown in the right panel of Fig. 8 supports our results reported in
Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Kutsenko (2021): fast-emerging ARs ex-
hibit, in general, higher ﬂare productivity, the correlation coeﬃcient
from the combined data set (N=84) is 0.61+0.12
−0.15. The similar rela-
tionship (with less inclined slope) seems to be valid for the separate
subset of type II ARs (blue circles). The vertical dashed line shows
the 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 = 3.4 × 1020 Mx h−1 magnitude, the upper level of the ﬂux
emergence rate for ﬂare-quiet ARs. To the right from this segment we
observe a well pronounced subset of strong-ﬂaring and fast-emerging
ARs with a clear proportionality between FI and 𝑅𝑎 𝑣. However, the
number of such ARs in our sample is less than 10%.

The data points in the right panel of Fig. 8 are located predom-
inantly above the main diagonal of the plot suggesting that fast-
emerging ARs must exhibit high ﬂare-productivity. At the same time,
ARs emerging at gradual rates may be ﬂare-quiet or may become
ﬂare-productive as well. So, for the entire data set, the relationship
between the ﬂux emergence rate and ﬂare index is more compli-
cated than a simple linear regression. Non-linear processes deﬁnitely
contribute into the formation of ﬂaring capabilities.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We used SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI data to analyse 100 ARs that
produced M5.0 or stronger ﬂares during Solar Cycles 23 and 24. Our
focus was an investigation of the observable magnetic ﬂux emergence
events during an interval of approximately 2-3 days before the ﬂaring
onset in the AR. We studied both qualitative and quantitative aspects
of the magnetic ﬂux emergence in these ﬂare-productive ARs.

We found that ARs may be sorted out into four types with respect
to the emergence of a magnetic ﬂux prior or during strongest ﬂares.
Type I consists of the ARs that emerged amidst a quiet-Sun area and
started to launch strong ﬂares immediately after (or even before) the
magnetic ﬂux reached its peak magnitude. The monotonous emer-
gence most often results in the formation of a complex magnetic
structure with a 𝛿-spot. Approximately one third (29%) of all ARs in
the sample were assigned to type I.

Emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux within a pre-existing AR was
denoted as type II. In most cases, a complex magnetic conﬁguration
is formed as a result of this new emergence. The amount of the new
magnetic ﬂux is signiﬁcant as compared to the pre-existing magnetic
ﬂux. For instance, the most ﬂare-productive NOAA AR 12673 in

Solar Cycle 24 was assigned to type II. Another quarter of all ARs
(24%) were identiﬁed as ARs of type II.

For one third of all analysed ARs (30%), emergence of only small
amount of new ﬂux was observed during the 2-3 days before a strong
ﬂare, type III ARs. Insigniﬁcant emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux
may result in the formation of a complex structure tending to produce
ﬂares. Interestingly, emergence of a very weak magnetic satellite of
about 1×1021 Mx in the vicinity of main sunspots is enough to
form a small 𝛿-sunspot that could provoke a X-class ﬂare. In our
opinion, newly-emerged dipoles may also trigger ﬂares in complex
pre-existing ARs. Undoubtedly, emerging dipoles may also play no
role in the occurrence of a ﬂare.

A large number of type III ARs in the sample are not promising
for the problem of the solar ﬂare forecast. In general, the duration
of emergence is proportional to the amount of emerging magnetic
ﬂux. Therefore, emergence of a relatively weak satellite in a pre-
existing ﬂare-quiet AR may occur within hours. This emergence may
result in a complication of the magnetic conﬁguration yielding a
start for strong ﬂaring. This means a decrease of the time interval

MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2021)

for the reliable prediction down to hours. Probably, new methods for
early detection of emerging magnetic ﬂux, for example, by means
of helioseismology (e.g. Birch et al. 2019; Dhuri et al. 2020), could
increase the forecast interval. The distortion of the electric current
system of a pre-existing AR by an emerging satellite, which was
discussed in Kutsenko et al. (2018), could also be used in the forecast.
Finally, the type IV ARs are the strong-ﬂaring ARs with no signa-
tures of the new ﬂux emergence during the entire interval of observa-
tions. It means that strong ﬂares could occur at least three days after
any emergence. All of type IV ARs were characterized by interacting
opposite magnetic polarities (see Fig. 6). Two of the strongest ﬂares
of Solar Cycle 23 belong to this type: NOAA ARs 09415 (X14.4,
Fig. 6a) and 10486 (X17.0, Fig. 6c). Although ARs of type IV are
not numerous (only 11 out of 100 ARs), the existence of these ARs
implies the following conclusion: the emergence is not a necessary
ingredient for an AR to produce a powerful ﬂare; once formed by
any scenario, an AR may keep the potential for ﬂaring as long as
favorable conditions are met.

To this end, we conclude that

(i) In 29% of cases the emergence was observed from the zero

background;

(ii) In 24% of cases the major emergence was observed in the

pre-existing AR;

(iii) In 30% of cases the minor emergence was observed in the

pre-existing AR;

(iv) In 11% of cased no emergence were detected;
(v) For 6% of cases data did not allow us to judge.

Our results also support the well-known dependence between the
peak magnetic ﬂux and ﬂaring productivity: stronger ﬂares tend to
occur in larger ARs. However, this dependence is just a tendency
rather than a strong rule. We suppose that the capability of an AR to
produce a strong ﬂare is determined to a great extent by its morphol-
ogy rather than by its size. The examples of relatively weak NOAA
ARs 09511 and 12017 discussed in Section 3 support this suggestion.

𝑅𝑎 𝑣 of ﬂare-quiet ARs is not well pronounced. Flare-productive and
ﬂare-quiet ARs rather form a continuous distribution 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 versus
Φ𝑚𝑎 𝑥 with ﬂare-productive ARs being mostly located at the higher
peak magnetic ﬂux end of the distribution.

The FI versus 𝑅𝑎 𝑣 scatter plot (the right panel of Fig. 8) suggests
that most points lie above the main diagonal, i.e. ﬂux emergence
rate deﬁnes lower limit of the ﬂare productivity. In other words, ARs
emerging at a very high rate must be ﬂare-productive. Gradually,
emerging ARs may exhibit both high and low ﬂaring productivity.
This distribution resembles the relationship between twist and ﬂux
emergence rate of ARs found in Kutsenko, Abramenko, & Pevtsov
(2019, see ﬁg. 3). Fast-emerging ARs were found to exhibit
strong twist. Gradually-emerging ARs could be either weakly or
strongly twisted. Perhaps, both dependencies on the ﬂux emer-
gence rate have the same physical reason: ﬂare-productive ARs
with 𝛿-structures are presumably formed as a result of emergence
of highly-twisted magnetic ﬂux bundles (Toriumi & Takasao 2017;
Knizhnik, Linton, & DeVore 2018).

Very high ﬂux emergence rate can be used as a precursor of strong
ﬂare activity of an AR in the future. Our estimates suggest that ﬂare-
quiet ARs do not exhibit ﬂux emergence rate higher than 3.4 × 1020
Mx h−1. However, the number of such ARs is less than 10% in our
sample. The most ﬂare-productive AR of Solar Cycle 24 NOAA
12673 exhibited extremely high ﬂux emergence rate. Sun & Norton
(2017) estimated the averaged ﬂux emergence rate to be 4.93+0.11
−0.13
Mx h−1 that is comparable to our value 5.89 ± 0.19 Mx h−1 (see
Table A1). We found that similar ﬂux emergence rate of about 6.09 ±
0.67 Mx h−1 was observed in NOAA AR 09393. The AR produced
one of the strongest ﬂare X20.0 of Solar Cycle 23. Interestingly, both
NOAA ARs 09393 and 12673 were classiﬁed as type II ARs: in both
cases fast emergence of a new magnetic structure was observed in
the close vicinity of pre-existing AR.

We hope that this study will contribute to the problem of reliable

ﬂare forecast.
