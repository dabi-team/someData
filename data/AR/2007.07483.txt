We extend the basic theory of Andreev reﬂection (AR) in a normal metal/superconductor junction
to the situation with an arbitrary time-dependent bias voltage V (t) across the junction. The central
element of the theory is the fact that the Fourier transform of the AR amplitude has a casual
structure. As an example, the theory is used to describe the current response to short pulses of
the bias voltage, which create coherent superposition of quasiparticle states with diﬀerent energies.
The current oscillates in time, with the gap frequency ∆/(cid:126), and also as a function of the pulse area
(cid:82) V (t)dt, with the period of the single-electron ﬂux quantum e/h.

Andreev reﬂection (AR) [1] is the process of conversion
of electrons in a normal metal (N) into Cooper pairs in
a superconductor (S) and vice versa, and represent the
main mechanism of electron transport across an NS in-
terface with large electron transparency. As a result, AR
determines the basic transport characteristics of the NS
junctions, including the linear conductance [2, 3], average
current [4–6] and current noise [7, 8]; in junctions with
very low transparency, one can observe individual AR
transitions [9]. AR also gives rise to an enormous amount
of various other transport phenomena. To give just a few
examples, it is the basic mechanism of the supercurrent
ﬂow in Josephson junctions [10–12] and, in the form of
multiple Andreev reﬂections (MAR), determines all their
transport characteristics at ﬁnite bias voltages: average
current [13–19], current noise [20–23] and full statistics
of charge transfer [24, 25]. AR produces thermoelectric
eﬀects in NS junctions [26–30], and plays an important
role in superconducting structures with other materials,
e.g., carbon nanotubes [31–33], graphene [34–37], topo-
logical insulators [38–41]. In all these situations, AR is
typically considered under the conditions of the constant
bias voltage, when the energy of the quasiparticles which
determine the AR amplitude can be taken to be constant
throughout the scattering process. However, in many sit-
uations, a more detailed theory of AR with an arbitrary
time-dependent bias voltage V (t) is desirable. The pri-
mary goal of this work is to develop such a theory.

Physically,

the main novel

the time-
dependent bias is the creation of coherent quantum su-
perposition of the quasiparticle states with diﬀerent en-
ergies. As a result, the junction produces an oscillatory
current response, the magnitude of which is sensitive to
the coherence properties of these superpositions. For in-
stance, as shown below, the oscillating current generated
by the AR processes is more stable to thermal averaging
than that produced by the quasiparticle tunneling, since
AR always involve two quasiparticles with vanishing to-
tal energy. Also, in the limit of short pulses of the bias
voltage, the quantum superposition of quasiparticle ener-
gies leads to the current oscillations as a function of the

total “magnetic ﬂux” (cid:82) V (t)dt carried by the pulse with
the period of the single-electron ﬂux quantum h/e.

We begin by outlining the derivation of our main re-
sults. We use the most basic model of an NS junction, a
small constriction between the normal and superconduct-
ing electrodes (Fig. 1a) with all transport modes charac-
terized by one transparency D. For short constriction,
it is possible to consider the constriction region itself
as normal, reducing the transport inside it to the mo-
tion of independent quasiparticles. We assume that the
bias voltage V (t) across the constriction is arbitrary, but
varies on the time scale set by the energy gap ∆ of the
superconductor and other small energies in the problem,
e.g., temperature T ; i.e., its characteristic frequencies are
smaller than the microscopic energy scales set by the
Fermi energy and by the traversal time of the barrier
that determines the transparency D. In this regime, we
can neglect the eﬀect of the bias voltage on D, and also
use the quasiclassical approximation for the quaiparticle
motion through the constriction. This general approach
is similar to the one used to describe the time-dependent
transport in normal conductors – see, e.g., [42].

One starts by accounting for the eﬀect of the bias volt-

age V (t) on the quasiparticle motion between the two
electrodes. The voltage creates the electric ﬁeld E(t, x)
localized in the constriction, V (t) = (cid:82) dxE(t, x), where
x is the coordinate along the constriction. (The assump-
tion of the relatively low frequencies of V (t) made above
also implies that E(t, x) is quasistatic from the point of
view of electromagnetism.) Describing this ﬁeld through
the vector potential A(t, x), E = −∂A/∂t, and solving
the time-dependent Scr¨odinger equation with A(t, x) in
the quasiclassical approximation, we see that the ampli-
tude ψe(t) of the wavefunction of an electron crossing the
constriction from the normal metal to the superconduc-
tor acquires the A(t, x)-dependent phase:

ψe(t) → exp{

(1)

where the phase φ is deﬁned by the relation ˙φ = e
(cid:126) V (t).
Electrons passing through the constriction in the op-
posite direction accumulate the phase of the opposite
sign. The phases acquired by the holes are switched
in comparison to those for the electrons. Physically,
these phase factors describe the acceleration/deceleration
of the quasiparticles as they move between the junction
electrodes. In the quasiclassical approximation, the par-
ticle energies change, while the change of their velocity
is small and is neglected.

Next, we introduce the Fourier components of the ac-

cumulated phase:

(cid:90)

e−iφ(t) =

dωW (ω)e−iωt,

(2)

in close analogy to what is done in the “Werthamer the-
ory” of the time-dependent properties of the Josephson
tunnel junctions [43, 44]. Then, the electron acceleration
process (1) has the following form in terms of the energy
components a((cid:15)) of the wavefunction ψe(t):
(cid:90)

a((cid:15)) →

dωW (ω)a((cid:15) − ω) .

(3)

The quasiparticle acceleration/deceleration described
above should be combined with the standard quasipar-
ticle scattering scheme in the NS junction as illustrated
schematically in Fig. 1b. For electrons incident from the
normal electrode on the constriction at energy (cid:15), the scat-
tering process consists of the normal barrier scattering
characterized by the scattering matrix U ,

with |t|2 = |t(cid:48)|2 = D and |r|2 = |r(cid:48)|2 = R, and Andreev
reﬂection at the NS interface with the amplitude:

For the holes incident from the normal electrode, the AR
amplitude is the same, while the scattering matrix is U ∗.
Solving this scattering scheme for the electrons and the
holes, taking the standard average over their equilibrium
energy distributions at temperature T , and combining
the electron and the hole contributions to the current,
we get the total current in the constriction:

where N is the number of the spin-degenerate trans-
port modes in the constriction.
In principle, this ex-
pression can be used directly to calculate the current in
the NS junction. For instance, for constant bias voltage,
W (ω) = δ(ω − eV /(cid:126)), and Eq. (6) reduces to the well-
known expression [4], which describes the evolution of the
dc IV curves from the regime of the tunnel to the bal-
listic junction with increasing quasiparticle transparency
D. For general time-dependent voltage, however, it is
more convenient to transform Eq. (6) explicitly into the
time domain.

As the ﬁrst step in this direction, we separate the term
in Eq. (6) that does not decay at large |(cid:15)|. The magnitude
of this term in the integral over (cid:15) is 1−R = D and it gives
D (cid:82) d(cid:15)[f ((cid:15) − ω) − f ((cid:15) + ν)] = D(ω + ν), meaning that this
contribution in Eq. (6) corresponds to the normal-state
current IN (t) in the junction:

where τ is the time normalized to the gap frequency, τ =

An important property of the AR amplitude A(x) (5)
is that it can be viewed as the reduction to the real axis
of the function of the complex variable z: A(z) = z −

z2 − 1. The function A(z) is analytic on the whole z
plane except for the cut on the [−1, 1] interval of the real
axis, and A(x) (5) on this interval is the value of A(z)
on the upper (Imz > 0) branch of the cut. This property
implies that the AR amplitude in the time domain has a
clear casual structure, vanishing for τ < 0:

where Φ is the total area under the voltage pulse, which
has the meaning of the magnetic ﬂux carried by this
pulse, and φV ≡ eΦ/h is the magnitude of this ﬂux in
units of the single-electron ﬂux quantum. Equations (7)
and (14) show that the current in this case is

I(t) = GΦδ(t) + Θ(t)I0(t) sin(2πφV ) ,

(15)

where qualitatively, the current I0(t) oscillates and de-
cays on the time scale (cid:126)/∆. The magnitude of this oscil-
latory response is modulated periodically, with the period
of the single-electron ﬂux quantum, by the area Φ of the
bias voltage pulse.

Quantitatively, the current I0(t) is

Taking the inverse Fourier transform to express the

Equation (14) for the time-dependent NS current can
be used to calculate the current under many diﬀerent bias
conditions. For intance, it shows that the main qualita-
tive feature of the junction response to the voltage that
varies rapidly on the time scale (cid:126)/∆ is interference of the
quasiparticle reﬂection from the gap edges which leads
to oscillations of the current in time with the gap fre-
quency, and also to oscillations in magnitude with the
applied voltage. Consider the simplest model of the volt-
age pulse that is inﬁnitely short on the gap time scale:

Equation (16) can be evaluated explicitly at large tem-
peratures, T (cid:29) ∆. In this limit, diﬀerent terms in (16)
have two diﬀerent behaviors as functions of temperature.

tunneling in the tunnel-junction limit, decays exponen-
tially with T :

(17)

This temperature dependence reﬂects the fact that the
quasiparticles tunnel at diﬀerent energies, and thermal
averaging of the partial amplitudes at diﬀerent energies
results in the exponential decay. In contrast to this, the
other two terms in Eq. (16) decay only as 1/T , as a re-
sult of all AR processes having total zero energy, and
therefore, thermal averaging reducing only the probabil-
ity of the incident quasiparticle to have the initial energy
within the range of ∆. Indeed, in the limit T (cid:29) ∆, the
ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (16) give at times t larger than
(cid:126)/T , when the exponentially decaying quasiparticle con-
tribution (17) can be neglected:

Equations (14) – (18) are valid for junctions with arbi-
trary quasiparticle transparency D. They can be simpli-
ﬁed further in the two limits of ballistic and the tunnel
junction. For the ballistic junction with D = 1, the ker-
nel K(τ ) (9) is given directly by the Fourier transform
(11) of the AR amplitude, and the total current is:

FIG. 2: Oscillating current in a ballistic NS junction driven by the
δ-function pulse of the bias voltage, as a function of time t for sev-
eral temperatures T . The oscillations are produced by interference
of the quasiparticle Andreev-reﬂection from the gap edges and are
suppressed as 1/T at large temperatures.

FIG. 3: Current in an NS tunnel junction as a function of time t
driven by the two voltage pulses (23) with two diﬀerent amplitudes
and the same characteristic time width t0. The curves illustrate
the pulse ﬂux control of the interference current which manifests
itself through the oscillating “tail” of the current response to the
short voltage pulse. The oscillation amplitude is modulated by
the ﬂux φV carried by the pulse according to Eq. (15).
In the
plotted curves, the oscillations are suppressed for the larger pulse
with φV = 0.5 in comparison to the smaller pulse with φV = 0.25.

In this case, the amplitude I0(t) (15) can be calculated
numerically from Eq. (19) and is shown in Fig. 2 for sev-
eral values of the temperature T . Outside of a small
range t ∼ (cid:126)/T near t = 0, where I0 goes to zero as t ln t,
the lowest curve in Fig. 2 agrees with Eq. (18), which for
D = 1 simpliﬁes to I0(t) = πG[(cid:126)J1(t∆/(cid:126))/t]2/(2eT ).

In the tunnel limit D (cid:28) 1, one can separate the single-
particle contribution IT to the current, which is propor-
tional to D and the Andreev-reﬂection current IAR pro-

One can also see directly that expansion in D of the gen-
eral form of this term does not have the D2 part, and
therefore, the AR part of the current is given directly by
the D2 term in Eq. (14). With the current kernels (20),
the time-dependent AR current in the tunnel limit is:

Finally, an important point to check is how the ideal-
ized δ-function limit of the voltage pulses is approached
by the pulses of ﬁnite time width. To do this, we adopt
the shape of the bias voltage pulse:

related to the one that can be produced by switching
Josephson junctions in the context of superconductor
electronics. An example of the current in the NS tunnel
junction calculated in the quasiparticle approximation
(21) for this pulse shape at low temperatures is shown
in Fig. 3. This Figure shows that the main qualitative
prediction of the δ-function approximation, ﬂux modu-
lation of the interference component of the NS current,
is reproduced by the pulses of the-not-extremely small
duration t0 = 0.1(cid:126)/∆.
