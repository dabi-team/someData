ABSTRACT

There is a wide range of eruptions in the solar atmosphere which contribute to space weather,
including the major explosions of radiation known as ﬂares. To examine pre-event behavior in δ-
spot regions, we use here a method based on the weighted horizontal gradient of magnetic ﬁeld
(WGM), deﬁned between opposite polarity umbrae at the polarity inversion line of active regions
(ARs) as measured using from the Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory catalogues. In this work,
we extend the previous analysis of high-energy ﬂares to include both medium (M) and low-energy
(C and B) ﬂares. First, we found a logarithmic relationship between the log value of highest ﬂare
class intensity (from B- to X-class) in a δ-spot AR and the maximum value of WGM of the 127
ARs investigated. We conﬁrm a trend in the convergence-divergence phase of the barycenters of
opposite polarities in the vicinity of the polarity inversion line. The extended sample (i) aﬃrms the
linear connection between the durations of the convergence-divergence phases of barycenters of
opposite polarities in δ-spot regions up to ﬂare occurrence and (ii) provides a geometric constraint
for the location of ﬂare emission around the polarity inversion line. The method provides a tool to
possibly estimate the likelihood of a subsequent ﬂare of the same or larger energy.

1. Introduction

A clear understanding of the dynamics and energetics of magnetic reconnection remains an impor-
tant goal of solar ﬂare research. A key aspect of this research area is to determine the dynamics of
an active region (AR) before ﬂare occurrence. Reliably identifying ﬂare precursors also has prac-
tical signiﬁcance for ﬂare predictions (see, e.g., Georgoulis, 2012, 2013; Barnes et al., 2016, and
references therein). The aim of ﬁnding such precursors was achieved by, e.g., Kors´os et al. (2014)
and Kors´os et al. (2015) (K14 and K15 thereafter, respectively), developing a new type of proxy
measure of magnetic non-potentiality in an AR.

K14 and K15 analysed the horizontal gradient of the line of sight (LOS) component of the
magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of polarity inversion lines (PILs), and found indicative features of
the imminent ﬂaring behaviour up to two-three days prior to the actual ﬂare occurrance. The pre-
ﬂare dynamics and the related physical processes at the solar surface were investigated using data
with an hourly temporal resolution from joint SDD ground- (Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory,
DHO) and space-based (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, SOHO) sunspot data catalogues (see,
e.g. Baranyi et al., 2016) from 1996 to 2010. Furthermore, K14 and K15 focused solely on the
largest intensity ﬂare-class during the investigated AR’s disk passage. Based on the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) ﬂare classiﬁcation system, the 61 investigated ﬂare
cases were all stronger than M5 ﬂare-class in those two papers.

K14 introduced the horizontal gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld (GM), a proxy which measures the
magnetic non-potentiality at the photosphere. The GM is applied between umbrae with opposite
polarities at the PIL of ARs and provides key information about the most important properties
of an imminent ﬂare: its intensity and occurrence time. K14 identiﬁed pre-ﬂare patterns of this
proxy quantity: increasing phase, high maximum and gradual decrease prior to ﬂaring. A linear
relationship was found between the pre-ﬂare GM maximum and the largest ﬂare intensity class of
the AR. Next, the occurrence time estimation was found to be somewhat less precise, for the most
probable time of ﬂare occurrence being between 2-10 hrs after the GM maximum.

In K15, the authors generalised the GM method and presented the concept of the weighted hori-
zontal gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld, WGM. The introduction of the WGM has enhanced the appli-
cation capability by indicating a second ﬂare precursor. Namely, the barycenters (the area-weighted
centers of the positive and negative polarities) display a pattern of approach and recession prior to
the ﬂare. We found that the ﬂare occurs when the distance between the barycenters is approximately
equal to the corresponding distance at the beginning of the convergence phase. This precursor has
the capability for a more accurate ﬂare occurrence time prediction, which is based on the relation-
ship between the durations of the divergence (TD+F) and convergence phase (TC) of the barycenters
of the opposite polarity regions. Next, K15 also found a linear relationship between the values of
the maxima of the WGM (WGmax
M ) and the highest ﬂare intensity of an AR(s). They reported that if
one can identify concurrently the two pre-ﬂare behaviours discussed above, then ﬂare(s) do occur
in their sample. They have also shown that if one of the required pre-ﬂare patterns is absent then a
ﬂare may not be expected (Kors´os et al., 2014; Kors´os and Ruderman, 2016).

In this study, we have generalised the application of the WGM method in two main ways. First,
we have expanded the number of investigated ARs by taking into account not only ARs observed by
the SOHO satellite but also those detected by the higher spatial and temporal resolution SDO (Solar
Dynamics Observatory) mission. Second, we have extended the analysis to encompass GOES ﬂare
classes from as low as B-class to as high as X-class ﬂares. In Section 2, we brieﬂy introduce and
apply the WGM method to lower energetic ﬂares, i.e. between B and M5 ﬂares. In Section 3, we
present an extended statistical analysis of these higher number of AR cases and summarise our
ﬁndings. In Section 4, we introduce a simple visualisation of our observational experience of the
pre-ﬂare behaviour of distance. Finally, we provide discussions of our results and draw conclusions
in Section 5.

2. Applying the WGM method

2.1. Implementation of the WGM Method

In 61 ﬂare cases, K15 demonstrated that WGM could be successfully applied to help identify
features preceding ﬂares with classes above M5. Later, in Zheng et al. (2015) and Kors´os and
Ruderman (2016), the WGM method was applied to case studies of lower than M5 ﬂare cases
employing the SDO/HMI-Debrecen Data (also known as HMIDD, the continuation of the SDD)
catalogue. In the present paper, we go further by enlarging the observational sample to include 6
ARs with B-class ﬂares, 21 with C-class ﬂares, 13 with M1-M5, and 30 additional ARs with ﬂare
events above M5 (see Appendix A).

The main reasons of the small number of the weaker than M5 ﬂaring AR in the sample are as
follows: (i) When the investigated strongest energetic ﬂare class becomes lower and lower (e.g. it
is below M5 or less) then there is an associated decreased chance of having this low-energy ﬂare
class to be the largest ﬂare class of an AR. (ii) In principle, the HMIDD (2011-2014) database
would be slightly more suitable to investigate the lower than M5-class ﬂares because the temporal
and spatial resolutions of this catalogue are better than that of the SDD. However, in case of these
weaker ﬂares, often, we simply cannot identify the two nearby opposite polarities of the AR in the
HMIDD catalogue, so, the WGM method is not applicable.

By considering lower-energy ﬂares, this expansion of the investigation of ﬂare classes explores
whether there could be a “common” physical mechanism underlying the ﬂare process across all
energy scales. However, it must be noted that our method does not give insight into which of the
wide range of proposed ﬂare models available in the literature is applicable. Our method points
merely towards the idea that, regardless of model, there could be a “common” pre-ﬂare features
identiﬁed at photospheric level.

The method is based on tracking changes of the solar surface magnetic conﬁguration in ARs with

the following ﬁve steps:

3

M. B. Kors´os, S. Yang and R. Erd´elyi: WGM method

1. During the entire investigated period it is required that the AR is located between −70◦ and +70◦
(occasionally, when the data permit +75◦, but not further) from the central meridian of the Sun.

2. During the AR’s disk passage, the largest intensity ﬂare-class event of the AR is selected from

the GOES ﬂare catalog.

3. In order to acquire enough preceding data to identify the precursors, the occurrence of the asso-

ciated strongest ﬂare class could be no further than ∼ 40◦ east of the central meridian.

4. The WGM method is applied in a selected area of the AR. As an initial approach, the selected
area is an entire δ-spot of the AR where all umbrae are now taken into account for analysis.
This assumption is based on the idea that the δ-type sunspots themselves are observed and iden-
tiﬁed as the most probable places for the ﬂare onset. A δ-type spot contains opposite polarity
umbrae surrounded by a common penumbra, therefore it has polarity inversion line(s) (PIL). It
is also well known that solar ﬂares often are related to PILs (Schrijver, 2007; Louis et al., 2015).
Furthermore, the umbrae are loci of high ﬂux densities, so they are presumably the dominant
components of the ﬂare processes. However, it should be noted that the Debrecen sunspot cata-
logue does not always indicate the two close opposite magnetic polarities as a δ-type spot. In this
case, the selected area is a circle with a radius of 1.5◦±0.5◦ around the barycentrum of the two
closest opposite polarity umbrae. We introduced the circle in the studied samples of K15. The
diameter of the circle is derived from the common amorphous shape penumbra of the opposite
polarity umbrae approximated by a circle with a radius of 1.5◦±0.5◦ in Carrington heliographic
coordinates. Finally, the selected area is tracked and the evolution (e.g., emergence of new ﬂux
or ﬂux cancellation) of umbrae are monitored.

5. At the end, the WGM method is applied to the selected area. The evolution of the unsigned
magnetic ﬂux, the distance between the area-weighted barycenters of opposite polarities and the
WGM are followed as outlined below:

(a) To establish that a behaviour is related to the upcoming ﬂare rather than merely an insigniﬁcant
ﬂuctuation, (i) the relative gradient of the rising phase of WGM is 30% and (ii) the relative
gradient of the distance parameter of the converging motion is greater than 10% for a period of
at least 4 hrs. Furthermore, a maximum of 10% deviation is allowed as the distance increases
back to its original value that it had at the moment when the convergence phase started.

above, then the WGmax

(b) When the relevant pre-ﬂare behaviour of the WGM proxy is identiﬁed as given in point a)
M can also be determined.
(c) Next, the relevant pre-ﬂare behaviour of the distance parameter is marked with a parabolic
curve. The parabolic curve is ﬁtted from the starting time of convergence to the end of the
divergence phase, where its minimum is the moment of reaching the closest position of the
two barycenters.

Let us comment on the errors and uncertainties of the WGM methods: The uncertainty in ob-
taining the distance parameter originates from the error of position measurements that is 0.1 helio-
graphic degree, while measuring the area has 10% error (Gy˝ori et al., 2011). The mean error of the
unsigned magnetic ﬂux is 15%. The magnetic ﬁeld used here to calculate WGM is estimated from

4

M. B. Kors´os, S. Yang and R. Erd´elyi: WGM method

the values of umbral area and mean ﬁeld strength recorded in the Debrecen (SDD and HMIDD)
catalogues through the application of Eq. (1) in Kors´os et al. (2014). Therefore, the total calculated
uncertainty of WGM is 20%.

2.2. Applying the WGM method to M-, C- and microﬂare cases

First, let us now demonstrate the technique of applying the WGM method to three representative
examples where the ﬂare classes are all lower than M5. The examples for analysis discussed here
are: AR 11504 produced two low M-class ﬂares; AR 11281 generated 3 C-class ﬂares as the largest-
class ﬂare. Finally, AR 11967 is interesting because it hosted a known and identiﬁed microﬂare
(Yang et al., 2015). In Yang et al. (2015), observational evidence of X-shape magnetic reconnection
before a microﬂare was introduced. The magnetic reconnection occurred at the topside edge of AR
11967 on February 3, 2014 07:15 UT. There, Yang et al. (2015) found that the X-shape reconnection
process builds up of two types of reconnection: (i) First, two anti-parallel loops slowly reconnect,
and, after the new loops were formed, they became stacked. This slow reconnection continued
for several tens of minutes. (ii) The second type of reconnection, the rapid reconnection, took only
about three minutes. During the rapid reconnection, the anti-parallel loops very quickly approached
each other and reconnected. After the rapid reconnection, the former anti-parallel loops disappeared
and new loops formed separately.

The resulting diagrams of the WGM analysis of ARs 11504, 11281, and 11967 are shown in Figs.
1a, 2a and 3, respectively. In Figs. 1a–3, we depict the pre- and post-ﬂare evolution of WGM (top
panel) and we also plot the distance between the barycentres of opposite polarities as a function
of time (middle panel). In the middle panels of Figs. 1a–3, the relevant pre-ﬂare behaviour of the
distance parameter is marked with red parabolic curves. In the bottom panels of Figs. 1a–3, we show
the temporal variation of the unsigned magnetic ﬂux in selected area. Figures 1b– 2b visualise the
investigated area by red ellipses in their white-light appearance (upper panel), the corresponding
magnetogram (middle panel) and the corresponding synthetic polarity drawing from the Debrecen
sunspot data catalogue (bottom panel) from which umbral area and mean ﬁeld strength are taken to
calculate WGM.

M

Let us ﬁrst investigate the case where the largest intensity ﬂare class was a weak M-class. AR
11504 produced an M1.2 ﬂare on June 13, 2012 13:17 UT and a further M1.9 ﬂare on June 14, 2012
=0.55·106
14:35 UT. In Figure 1a, we see that the WGM increases to a maximum value (WGmax
M
Wb/m), followed by a less steep decrease which ends with an M1.2 (WG f lare
=0.35·106 Wb/m)
ﬂare and is succeeded by another M1.9 (WG f lare
=0.23·106 Wb/m ) energetic ﬂare (top panel). The
conditions speciﬁed by step 5a are satisﬁed by the pre-ﬂare behaviour of the WGM, therefore we can
dismiss the idea that this behaviour is unconnected to the ﬂare. Moreover, the percentage diﬀerence
(WG%
M) is only 34% in the ﬁrst ﬂare case, which is less than 42% (as deﬁned by the criterion given
by K15), therefore we expected more ﬂares to follow, which did indeed happen. After the second
ﬂare, the WG%
M is 61%, so further ﬂares were not expected. Regarding the distance parameter, the
two convergence-divergence phases are evident. The ﬁrst one is before the M1.2 ﬂare where the
TC is 9 hrs and TD+F is 34 hrs. The second one occurred before the M1.9 ﬂare where TC is 14 hrs
and TD+F is 19 hrs. It is worth mentioning that the two convergence phases of the barycenters had
a duration longer than 4 hrs; the relative gradient of the ﬁrst decreasing phase is 56% and for the
second one it is 54%.

Let us now introduce a representative example of the analysis of a C-class ﬂare of this by inves-
tigating, AR 11281. This AR was the cradle to the following 3 C-class ﬂares: C1.8 on September 2,
2011 15:16 UT, C2.4 and C1.2 on September 3, 2011 07:56 and 20:10 UT, respectively. In Fig. 2a,
we recognise the following pre-ﬂare properties of the WGM and the distance: (i) The rising phase
=0.78·106 Wb/m) is followed by a less steep decrease
and a maximum value of the WGM (WGmax
M
which ends with C1.8 (WG f lare
=0.51·106 Wb/m) and after that
with the C1.2 (WG f lare
=0.36·106 Wb/m) energetic ﬂares. The conditions of point 5a are satisﬁed,
therefore the pre-ﬂare behaviour can be conﬁdently attributed to the ﬂare. (ii) The convergence-
divergence feature of the barycentric distance prior to the ﬁrst C-class ﬂare are also evident. The
duration of the convergence phase of the distance is 13 hrs and the gradient is 26%. The ﬁrst ﬂare
occurred 30 hrs later, measured from the moment of the closest position of the two opposite polar-
ity barycenters. The second C-class ﬂare occurred approximately 17 hrs after the ﬁrst C-class ﬂare.

The ﬁnal C1.2 ﬂare occurred 12 hrs after the second C2.4 ﬂare. Let us now brieﬂy investigate the
percentage diﬀerences of the three ﬂares. The WG%
M is 42% after the ﬁrst C-class ﬂare (C1.8). The
M is 35% after the C2.4 and 54% after the last C-class occurrence from the previous WGmax
WG%
M .
We conclude that one should indeed expect ﬂare(s) after the ﬁrst C1.8 ﬂare, and that one should
not expect further same class ﬂare(s) after the last C-class, which is what happened. Because there
was only one clear U-shape ﬂare precursor, we could not say anything about how many same-class
ﬂares will follow the ﬁrst C ﬂare.

In Figure 3, for AR 11967 we analysed the same area in the HMIDD catalogue as was analysed

from HMI line-of-sight magnetograms in Fig. 1 of Yang et al. (2015).

One can indeed recognise the increasing and decreasing phase of the WGM before the microﬂare.
The maximum value of the WGM is 0.65·106 Wb/m and the value of the WG f lare
is 0.38·106 Wb/m.
The WG%
M is 42% after the maximum of the WGM. Unfortunately, we cannot say whether a further
ﬂare occurred because we do not have any later observations from this area. Next, the convergence
and divergence phases of the distance are also identiﬁable: we emphasise this with a red parabola
in the middle panel of Fig. 3. Here, the duration of the observed TC is 7 hrs, with 40% decreasing
of the distance and TD+F is 6 hrs. Based on the required conditions and steps outlined in 1-5 above,
these two pre-ﬂare behaviours can be classiﬁed as true precursors of the microﬂare. Note that there
may be another typical pre-ﬂare behaviour of the WGM and distance between 02/02 08:00 and 02/02
18:00. Although, based on 5(a), the pre-ﬂare behaviour of the WGM could be a precursor, but, the

pre-ﬂare behaviour of distance does not qualify as a precursor because the decreasing time is only
one hour. In summary, as Fig. 3 demonstrates, it is clear that even microﬂares seem to show the
precursors of ﬂaring identiﬁed by the horizontal magnetic gradient method.

From these three sample studies presented (Figs. 1–3) and, supported by analyses of the entire en-
semble data, we propose that the pre-ﬂare behaviour of WGM and the distance of the area-weighted
barycentre of opposite polarities may be present widely and may be indispensable before the as-
sociated reconnection and/or ﬂaring process. If the conjecture of pre-ﬂare behaviour is proven to
even more solar data than the current ensemble of 127 AR cases, this will certainly give us a greater
statistical signiﬁcance for understanding the underlying physics.

3. Statistical analyses of WGM method on the extended data

Our aim is to analyse the photospheric precursors of ﬂares of a 127 strong set of AR from SDD and
HMIDD. First, let us focus on the relationship between the log value of largest intensity ﬂare of
an AR (log(I)) and the preceding maximum of the WGM (see Fig. 4). We have found a logarithmic
M . The correlation coeﬃcient of the ﬁtted logarithmic
dependence between the log(I) and the WGmax
function is R2 = 0.54 and is an indicator for a reasonable functional ﬁt to the data. The root mean
square error (RMSE) of log(I[W/m2]) is 0.51.

Next, the WGM method reveals further important connections between the proposed precursors
and the associated ﬂare properties. K15 showed that, for large ﬂares, there is a relationship between
the duration of the converging motion (TC) and the sum of the duration of the diverging motion of

the barycenters of opposite polarities together with the remaining time until ﬂare peak (TD+F). The
question is then whether this relationship is also valid in the extended data studied here. In other
words, it is of interest to establish whether this relationship found for ﬂares above M5 remains for
less energetic ﬂares, i.e. below M5 down to C-class or microﬂares.

Figure 5 (left panel) gives a further insight into the relation between these physical quantities by
plotting the elapsed time between the start of the divergence phase and the ﬂare peak as a function of
the duration of converging motion. The linear relationship found may possess the capability to esti-
mate an approximate occurrence time of the associated ﬂare. R2 of the ﬁtted linear function is 0.60
indicating a moderate correlation. By identifying the start of the divergence phase of the barycen-
ters of opposite polarity, one may predict the time of ﬁrst ﬂare occurrance with an estimated error
of 7.2 hrs. We also investigated whether there is a correlation between the duration of converging-
diverging motion and the ﬂare intensity, but we were unable to conclude any statistically signiﬁcant
relationship.

Figure 5 (right panel) shows the linear correlation between the distance from the starting point of
the converging phase to the point of the closest approach (DC) and the distance between the point
of closest approach to the position of the ﬁrst ﬂare occurrences (DF M). The linear ﬁt between DC
and DF M may provide another practical tool for estimating the spatial location of the ﬂare. Here, the
R2 of the linear regression is only 0.42 which means that the correlation is moderate. The RMSE
is 3.6 Mm. Again, we cannot report any statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the distance
values and ﬂare intensity. However, it is worth mentioning that the expected occurrence time and
estimated location could both reinforce the search for a more reliable ﬂare prediction.

M is over 55%, no further energetic ﬂares are expected; but, if the WG%

Last, but not least, we carried out an analysis similar to that of K15 to estimate the corresponding
probability thresholds and have found reassuring results conﬁrming the earlier ﬁndings. Namely, if
the WG%
M is less than ∼40%,
a further ﬂare is probable within approximately 18 hrs. If the WG%
M is between 40% and 55%, one
cannot make a reliable prediction of whether additional ﬂares will/will not take place. In summary,
therefore, these properties of the WGM method may serve as practical ﬂare watch alert tools across

4. Visualisation of pre-ﬂare behaviour of the distance parameter

In this section, inspired by laboratory experiments, we introduce a simple visual interpretation of
the observed pre-ﬂare behaviour of the area-weighted barycenters of opposite polarities prior to the
reconnection process. The process of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere is mostly stud-
ied either using space-based observations or theoretical (e.g. numerical or analytical) modelling.
However, laboratory experiments may also yield some interesting insight and impetus. A good ex-
ample is the series of experimental studies by e.g. Yamada (1999) and Yamada et al. (2010). Yamada
(1999) investigating the physics of magnetic reconnection in a controlled laboratory environment.
In these experiments, reconnection is driven by torus-shaped ﬂux cores which contain toroidal and
poloidal coil windings. Two types of reconnection modes were found, according to whether the
poloidal ﬁeld coil current increased or decreased. When the poloidal coil current increased then
the poloidal ﬂuxes increased as well and plasma was pushed toward the X-point. This reconnec-
tion process is called the push mode. On the other hand, when the poloidal current decreased, the
associated decreasing poloidal ﬂux in the common plasma was pulled back toward the X-point, a
reconnection process known as the pull mode. They found that the push mode occurs more rapidly
than the pull mode.

Besides the extensive modelling in the literature, the experiments by Yamada et al. (2010) have
been a direct drive to solar observational studies of the process of magnetic reconnection. For ex-
ample, in K15, it was found that the area-weighted barycentres of two opposite magnetic polarities
of an AR in the investigated area ﬁrst approach each other, reach their minimum distance followed
by a divergence phase. Most surprisingly, the ﬂare occurrence(s) take place when the growth of the
distance becomes large enough and it approaches the value it had at the beginning of the conver-
gence phase (for the actual details see their middle panel of Figs. 1a–3). K15 have shown, using
61 samples from the SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) era, that there is never a large

separation distance D0 are convergence; (2) the two opposite polarities are at their closest and a
current sheet starts forming, where DMin is the minimum distance, with D0 > DMin; (3) the two

occurs above the polarity inversion line (PIL). After the distance between the polarity barycentres

or increase (i.e. D1 < D0 or D1 > D0). DC=D0-DMin in Fig. 5 (right panel).

ﬂare occurrence when the barycenters are closest. Occasionally, though, smaller so-called precursor
ﬂares may take place. The divergence phase was found to continue until the distance increased back
to about its original value, i.e. to the level of separation when the convergence phase started. The
most energetic ﬂares were found to happen after the divergence phase, and for the ﬂare occurrence
time a statistical relationship was established in terms of the duration of the convergence/divergence
phases (see left-hand side of Fig. 5).

In Figure 6, we introduce a simple visualisation of the pre-ﬂare behaviour. First, the two opposite
magnetic polarities start convergence (panel 1), with an initial barycentric distance of D0. When
the barycentres reach their closest position (i.e. the separation is Dmin), a thin current sheet begins
to form between the opposite polarity ﬁeld lines (or sheets) but there is no reconnection yet (see

11

M. B. Kors´os, S. Yang and R. Erd´elyi: WGM method

panel 2). After the minimum distance stage, the two opposite polarities begin to recede from each
other and the separation at photospheric level increases back to the about the same level of sepa-
ration when the converging process started (see panel 3), with barycentric separation distance of
∼D0. The current sheet is still forming during the divergence phase above the photosphere. Finally,
reconnection takes place, however, well after the moment when the photospheric distance between
the area-weighted centres of polarity is at its about the same value of what it had at the beginning
of the convergence phase (see panel 4), with a barycentric distance D1. During the process of mag-
netic reconnection, the magnetic ﬁeld lines rearrange according to the yet unknown key principles
of reconnection in the highly stratiﬁed lower solar atmosphere. This rearrangement is accompanied
with a sudden energy release, e.g. ﬂare eruption, where the energy of eruption was stored in the
stressed magnetic ﬁelds.

A further possible explanation of our empirical ﬁnding may be that the actual convergence phase
is caused by bipolar ﬂux emergence between the two barycenters at the area of the PIL that even-
tually brings the barycenters closer. Next, the divergence may be caused by the strong shearing
motion between the opposite polarities (Ye et al., 2018).

5. Conclusions

Most ﬂare forecasting models attempt to predict ﬂare probability (see, e.g., Georgoulis, 2012, 2013;
Barnes et al., 2016, and references therein). Many of these ﬂare forecast studies focus on a predictive
time window of 6, 12, 24 and 48 hrs (see, e.g., Al-Ghraibah et al., 2015; Benz, 2017, and references
therein). In K15, the concept of the weighted horizontal gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld, WGM, was
introduced where all umbrae were taken into account in the selected δ-spot for analysis. Initially,
the WGM method was tested on data available from the SOHO era only.

Here, we carry out an extended statistical analysis of these photospheric precursors of pre-ﬂare
dynamics on a larger sample of δ-spots observed, including not only those contained by SDD but
also by those found in HMIDD. The main motivation is to further develop, improve and conﬁrm
the applicability of two parameters (the WGM and barycentric distance parameters) introduced.
Inspired by the results of Zheng et al. (2015) and Kors´os and Ruderman (2016), we expanded
the statistical sample of ﬂares to be investigated below the M5-class down to B-class microﬂares,
therefore oﬀering an over-arching view of the applicability of the WGM method for a wider energy
spectrum of ﬂares. An answer is searched for to the question, do smaller ﬂares display the same
predictive pre-ﬂare features as their stronger cousins. In the present work, we have outlined the
case for the aﬃrmative answer.

In Section 2, we introduced three representative δ-type ARs, AR 11504, AR 11281 and AR
11967 for presenting characteristic sample studies from our extended dataset. These are typical ARs
for less signiﬁcant GOES energetic ﬂare classes. Based on Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory
catalogues, in all of the observed δ-spot of the 127 ARs, we have identiﬁed the two pre-ﬂare patterns
established earlier in K15: (i) the pre-ﬂare behaviour pattern of WGM: a rising phase, a maximum
and a gradual decrease prior to ﬂaring and (ii) the pre-ﬂare evolutionary pattern of the distance of the
area-weighted barycentres during the converging and diverging motion from the minimum distance
value of the area-weighted barycenters of opposite polarities until the ﬂare occurrence. Furthermore,
we have set out empirical conditions that the WGM and the barycenter distance parameters have to
satisfy to qualify as being precursive of a ﬂare rather than an unrelated ﬂuctuation.

12

After identifying the pre-conditions, we have also investigated the relationship between the inten-
sity of ﬂares from δ-spots in terms of the WGmax
M (see Fig 4). We have always focussed on the largest
intensity ﬂare (I) which has occurred in the given AR after reaching WGmax
M . By extending the ﬂare
samples down to B-class, we found a logarithmic relationship between the log(I) of the investigated
ARs and WGmax
M . This relationship may provide a tool to estimate the log(I) of the expected ﬂare
with ± 0.51 uncertainty from the measured WGmax
M .
In K15, we found a linear relationship between the duration of the converging motion and the time
elapsed from the moment of minimum distance until the ﬂare peak. Our extended statistical sample
from SDD and HMIDD data from B-class to X-class ﬂares, again, conﬁrms this linear relationship.
Therefore, we propose that if one can reliably identify the moment when the barycenter distance
in a δ-spot begins to grow again then one is able to estimate the occurrance time of the ﬂare with
± 7.2 hrs of uncertainty. Furthermore, we also investigated the connection between the length of
distance from the starting point of the converging phase to the point of closest approach (DC) and
the distance between the point of closest approach to the position of the ﬁrst ﬂare (DF M) between
the area-weighted barycentres. The linear relationship, with an estimated error of 3.6 Mm, found
between DC and DF M may help to identify the region where the ﬂare occurrence may be expected.
So, the expected time of ﬂare occurrence and its predicted location could serve as combined tools
for ﬂare warning.

M) between the value of the WGmax

We have also searched for phenomenological clues for diﬀerences for predicting the number of
ﬂares expected from δ-spots after the horizontal magnetic gradient reaches WGmax
M , during its de-
creasing phase. In K15, for ﬂares stronger than M5, the conclusion was: if the percentage diﬀerence
M and the ﬁrst value of the WGM after the ﬂare peak (WG f lare
(WG%
M )
is over 54%, no further energetic ﬂare(s) may be expected; but, if the percentage diﬀerence is less
than about ∼42%, further ﬂaring is likely within the following 18 hrs. In the present study, we have
revisited the estimated probability of further ﬂares during the descending phase of the WGM after
its maximum. We found encouraging results extending the initial ﬁndings of K15 to a wider ﬂare
energy range, namely: if the percentage diﬀerence (WG%
M) is over 55%, no further energetic ﬂare(s)
may be expected; but, if WG%
M is less than ∼40%, further ﬂaring is probable within about 18 hrs.
The importance of this empirical result is that it could be a further auxiliary tool for indicating the
properties of imminent ﬂares from δ-spots.
