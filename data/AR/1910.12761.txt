Abstract 

In this Letter, we investigate the variation of endohedral A@CN potential due to addition at 
the center of it a positive charge, for example, in the process of atom A photoionization. Using a 
reasonable model to describe the fullerenes shell, we managed to calculate the variation that is a 
consequence of the monopole polarization of CN shell. 

We  analyze  model  potentials  with  flat  and  non-flat  bottoms  and  demonstrate  that  the 
phenomenological  potentials  that  properly  simulates  the  C60  shell  potential  should  belong  to  a 
family  of  potentials  with  a  non-flat  bottom.  As  concrete  example,  we  use  the  Lorentz-bubble 
model potential. By varying the thickness of this potential, we describe the various degrees of the 
monopole polarization of the C60 shell by positive electric charge in the center of the shell. 

We  calculated  the  photoionization  cross-sections  of  He,  Ar  and  Xe  atoms  located  at  the 
center  of  C60  shell  with  and  without  taking  into  account  accompanying  this  process  monopole 
polarization  of  the  fullerenes  shell.  Unexpectedly,  we  found  that  the  monopole  polarization  do 
not affect the photoionization cross sections of these endohedral atoms.

1. 
The  aim  of  this  Letter  is  to  find  the  extra  potential  induced  in  the  electron  shell  of  an 
endohedral  A@CN under the action  of an extra positive charge z added at its center due  to, for 
example,  photoionization  of  atom  A.  We  intend  also  to  investigate  the  effect  of  this  extra 
potential upon photoionization cross-section of an endohedral. 

The  idea  that  the  electron  interaction  with  almost  fullerene  CN  can  be  described  by  a 
phenomenological  potential  U(r)  formed  by  smeared  carbon  atoms  is  a  widely  used  approach 
(see, for example [1,2] and references therein) despite the fact that this approach is an essential 
simplification of the real molecular field. The atom smearing procedure determines the form of 
the potential function U(r). If it is assumed [3] that the positive charge of the C nuclei together 
with the negative charge of the electrons is smeared in volume between two concentric spheres, 
we come to a function U(r) in the form of potential well with а flat bottom. We can use another 
averaging. At first, let us smear the positive charge over a sphere with the radius R, taking into 
account that all the nuclei of carbon atoms are located at equal distances from the  center of the 
fullerene cage.  After that, we define  the electron spatial distribution in the electric  field of  this 
sphere, and come to a potential well with a non-flat bottom [4]. 

Poisson equation determines the mutual spatial distribution of positive and negative electric 
charges creating the  potential U(r). The solutions of this equation are significantly different for 
these two types of the function U(r). The functions with a flat bottom correspond to onion-like 
molecular structure with two spatially separated double-charges layers; while the functions U(r) 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
with non-flat bottom  correspond to three-layer charges structure, in which the layer  of positive 
charges is located between two negative ones. Such an arrangement of the positive and negative 
components of the fullerene shell leads to appearance of a minimum of the function U(r) at r=R. 

As a concrete example of СN, let us consider almost spherical fullerene С60. Its shell under 
the  action  of  an  external  electric  field,  for  example,  a  positive  charge  z1  located  far  from  the 
center of the cage, acquires an induced electric dipole moment and the C60 shell becomes dipolar 
polarized. The z charge in the center of C60 compresses the electron cloud toward the center of 
the shell, retaining its spherical shape, thus leading to its monopole polarization.  We  encounter 
such a situation, for example, in photoionization of the endohedrals with atom A  located at the 
center of the fullerenes cage. 

The inner volume of C60 shell is large enough to accommodate individual atoms A or even 
small  molecules. The Van der  Waals forces  acting between the electrically neutral  atom  A  and 
the  C60  shell  are too  weak  to  distort  the  electronic  structure  of  both  A  and  the  shell  itself,  and 
therefore these structures one can consider as  independent of each other.  The situation changes 
because of, for example, photoionization of encapsulated atom [5], when a positive charge arises 
in  the  shell  center.  In  this  case,  the  positive  electric  field  of  atomic  residue  shifts  the  negative 
electron  density  of  the  C60  shell  relative to  positive density  of  carbon  ions.  The  shifting  of  the 
electron density in each elementary volume of the C60 shell under the action of positive atomic 
residue A+ results in creating an induced electric dipole moment of this volume, the axes of all 
elementary dipole moments being directed to the center of the C60 sphere. As a result, the electric 
component  of  the  shell,  as  a  whole,  shifts  toward  the  sphere  center,  leading  to  monopole 
polarization of the shell and change of the shape of C60 static potential U(r). 

Paper  [5]  analyzes  the  effect  of  monopole  polarization  in  the  process  of  A@C60 
photoionization. The authors of [5] called it  “interior static polarization  of the C60 shell”. They 
write: “The quintessence of the effect is that the ion reminder A+, ones the photoionization taken 
place  and  the  photoelectron  is  produced,  could  polarize  the  C60  cage…This  causes  that  the 
fullerene  shell  potential  U(r)  to  be  different  versus  the  situation  without  consideration  of  static 
polarization”.  To  take  into  account  this  effect,  the  authors  of  [5]  have  introduced  a  modified 
version of rectangular potential well. They conclude that the interior static polarization of the C60 
shell “may not be ignored in the photoionization of endohedral atoms near threshold”. 

The present Letter is devoted to the consideration of C60 monopole polarization within the 
framework of other type of model potentials with non-flat bottom, so-called the Lorentz-bubble 
potential  [6,  7].  First,  we  examine with  the  Poisson  equation  the  spatial distribution  of  charges 
that create a potential well with a Lorentz profile. Then, by varying the thicknesses of the left and 
right  wings  of  the  potential  well,  we  establish  the  relationship  of  this  variation  with  the 
displacement of part of the collectivized electrons relative to the positive frame of the fullerene 
shell. Further, we will estimate the relative number of electrons pulled into the center of the cage 
by a positive electric charge z in its center. We will use the asymmetric Lorentz potential well to 
calculate the photoionization cross sections of He, Ar and Xe endohedral atoms. 

2. 
The model potential U(r) for C60 shell should satisfy two general requirements. At first, it 
the  binding 
should  be  attractive  and  support  at 
,  thus  reproducing  the  electron  affinity  measured  in  UV  photoelectron 
energy
spectroscopy of the C60 negative ion [8]. At second, the potential U(r) should be located near the 

least  one  electronic  s-state  with

atomic  units.  In  [6,  7]  U(r)  has  been  calculated  within  the  framework  of  the  self-consistent 
spherical jellium model for collectivized electrons. In this approach, the electrostatic potential of 
the fullerene shell as  a whole is a sum of the positive potential of carbon atom  nuclei smeared 
over  a  sphere  with  radius  R,  and  a  negative  potential  created  by  the  electron  clouds.  The

C60  shell  is  equal  to  zero  because  the  potential  (1)  is  a  short-range potential.  Integration  of  the 
negative  parts  of  curve  Q(r)  shows  that  about  46%  of  negative  charge  is  located  in  the  inner

Charge density of C

Let us estimate, in a crude approximation, 
the fraction of electrons transferred from the outer 
cloud  to  the  inner  one  under  the  influence  of  a 
positive  electric  charge  z  placed  at  the  center  of 
the cage. Suppose that the electrons of both clouds 
are  located  on  concentric  spheres  with  radii 
determined by the minima of the electron densities 
of the outer and inner clouds. According to figure 
1, the gap between these spheres ΔR ≈ 1. We will 
consider the entire system of positive and negative 
charges  as  a  spherical  condensator,  on  the  plates 
of  which  negative  charges  are  placed  in  the 
proportions  of  46%  and  54%.  We  assume  that 
such a positive charge between the spheres charge 
distributions  stabilizes  them.  The  electric  field 
inside this condesator is equal to zero; otherwise, 
the electrons would have passed from one plate to 
another.  After  introducing  the  charge  z  into  the 
cage,  some  charge  q  will  move  from  the  outer 
sphere to the inner one to compensate the electric 
field  z/R2.  Taking  into  account  that  the  electric 
field between the plates of a spherical capacitor is 
indistinguishable from the field of a point charge, 
one has z/R2 ≈ q/ΔR2. So, we obtain for the charge 
q the following estimation
. Thus, a 
(
z R R
 
1z    causes  the  transfer  of  about  2% 
unit  charge 
of electrons from the outer cloud to the inner one. This charge displacement corresponds to a set 
of the parameters ΔL and ΔR on the second row of the Table.

Let us apply symmetric and asymmetric Lorentz 
potential  wells  to  calculate  the  photoionization  cross-
sections of some endohedral atoms. The specific feature 
of an endohedral atom photoionization is oscillations in 
the photoionization cross-sections, commonly known as 
confinement 
confinement 
resonances.  Comparing 
resonances for two types of the Lorentz potential wells, 
we  shall  evaluate  the  role  of  monopole  polarization  of 
the C60 shell in this process. These potentials we have to 
ˆH , 
add  to  the  atomic  Hartree-Fock  Hamiltonian 
thereby  obtaining  the  equation  for  the  electrons  of 
endohedral  atom  located  at  the  center  of  C60  shell.

give the initial- and  final-state  electron  wave  functions 
of  encapsulated  atom.  They  are  used  in  calculations  of 
photoionization cross-sections. The results are presented 
in figures 2-4.  
The  curves  in  these  figures  correspond  to  the  set  of 
parameters ΔL and ΔR from the fourth row of the Table. 
The  sets  of  parameters  on  the  second  and  third  rows 
give  the  curves  indistinguishable  from  the  curves 
corresponding  to  the  symmetric  potential  well.  Thus, 
the  monopole  polarization  of  the  C60  shell  begins  to 
affect the photoionization of the endohedral atom with a 
shift  of  approximately  15%  of  collectivized  electrons. 
With  this  shift,  the  discrepancies  of  the  curves  for  the 
symmetric and asymmetric potentials are of the order of 
the  line  thickness.  Coincidence of curves  demonstrates 
the  absence  of  the  monopole  polarization  effect  on  the 
photoionization  of  endohedral  atom*.  So,  given  in  [5] 
statement  that  static  monopole  polarization  of  the  C60 
shell  “may  not  be  ignored  in  the  photoionization  of 
endohedral  atoms  near 
threshold”  is  emphatically 
incorrect.

It  is  interesting  to  trace  the  emergence  and 
development  of  the  concept  of  rectangular  potential 
itself.  In  one  of  the  first  papers  [2]  we  read:  “We 
introduce  a  shell  of  positive  rigid  background  charge, 
jellium,  which  is  symmetrically  placed  with  respect  to 
the  radius  R  of  the  C60  molecule”;  i.e.,  the  positive 
charge  of  the  shell  is  uniformly  filling  the  spherical 
layer between two concentric spheres. If the authors [2] 
suggested that the electrons of the shell are located in it, 
like  “raisins  in  a  bun”,  then  they  would  have  the 
structure resembling the J.J. Thomson’s “plum pudding 
model”  of  an  atom.  However,  the  authors  of  [2]  went 
another way and defined the electron density in the shell 
and  its  effective  potential  by  solving  the  Poisson 
equation with rigid positive spherical layer. As a result, 
they  obtained  the  square  potential  well  that  now  is  a 
widely  used  model  for  the  C60  shell  without  any 
mention about the assumptions made. 

Let  us  apply  the  Poisson  equation  (3)  to 
potential function (7) to understand, what charge distribution corresponds to this potential well. 
Using the Heaviside step function (5), we rewrite the function (7) in the following form

The reasons why we replace the stepwise function (7) by diffuse potentials (8) will become clear 
later. Let us begin from the case 
0  that corresponds to the spatial distribution of the electric 
charge densities when the static polarization of the shell is ignored (the details of calculations are 
in [11]). Figure 5 presents the charge distribution function
. According to this figure, 
two concentric spheres  with radii  r  = r0 and r0+Δr bearing the double  electric layers create the 
radial non-modified square well potential. The thicknesses of layers (for parameter η = 0.05) are 
about 0.05 at. un. Both spheres are electrically neutral. On a surface of the inner sphere,  about 
36% of positive and negative charges are located. The surface of the outer sphere localizes the

. Again, we have zero in the right side of (10) because r≠0 in this line. Thus, the additional terms 
in potential function (7) do not lead to alterations in the mutual disposition of electric charges in 
the  C60  shell,  as  well  as  to  static  monopole  polarization  of  the  fullerene  shell  by  the  electric 
charge located in the center of the shell. Therefore, the question arises, what is the reason for the 
significant  change  in  the  photoionization  cross  section  predicted  in  [5].  The  answer  is  that  the 
authors of [5] simply introduced new arbitrary parameter (in addition to old arbitrary parameters 
r0 and Δr) into the ordinary rectangular potential, which have nothing to  do with the monopole 
polarization of the C60 shell. 

4.  We  observe  here  an  interesting  and  strange  peculiarity:  the  monopole  polarization  of  an 
endohedral shell that appear due to inner atom photoionization does not affect the cross section of 
this process. The result is obtained, however, in the frame a rather crude model that describes the 
fullerenes electron shell. 

The  problem  with  model  description  of  the  shape  and  parameters  of  the  fullerene  shell 
potential is similar, to some extent, to that in nuclear physics where the potential for the nucleon-
nucleon interaction is unknown. To describe the nuclei the researchers use complicated shapes of 
the potentials, up to such exotic as “Elsasser wine bottle” or “Mexican hat” depending on a great 
number of parameters. In such a way, one could model all the magic numbers of nuclei (see e.g. 
[12]).  We  hope  that  more  detailed  experimental  investigations  of  C60  itself  and  endohedral 
systems  A@C60  will  make  the  search  for  the  model  potential  of  C60  more  constructive  than  a 
simple increase in the number of arbitrary parameters in the old model and will discover a new 
avenue to modification of the C60 shell models.
