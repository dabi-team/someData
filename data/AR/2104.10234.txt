ABSTRACT

Context. The origin of the slow solar wind is still an open issue. It has been suggested that upﬂows at the edge of active regions are a
possible source of the plasma outﬂow, and therefore contribute to the slow solar wind.
Aims. Here, we investigated the origin and morphology of the upﬂow regions and compared the upﬂow region and the active region
core properties.
Methods. We studied how the plasma properties (ﬂux, Doppler velocity, and non-thermal velocity) change throughout the solar
atmosphere, from the chromosphere via the transition region to the corona in the upﬂow region and the core of an active region.
We studied limb-to-limb observations of the active region (NOAA 12687) obtained between 14th and 25th November 2017. We
analysed spectroscopic data simultaneously obtained from IRIS and Hinode/EIS in six emission lines (Mg ii 2796.4Å, C ii 1335.71Å,
Si iv 1393.76Å, Fe xii 195.12Å, Fe xiii 202.04Å, and Fe xiv 270.52Å and 274.20Å). We studied the mutual relationships between the
plasma properties for each emission line, as well as comparing the plasma properties between the neighbouring formation temperature
lines. To ﬁnd the most characteristic spectra, we classiﬁed the spectra in each wavelength using the machine learning technique k-
means.
Results. We found that in the upﬂow region the Doppler velocities of the coronal lines are strongly correlated, but the transition region
and coronal lines show no correlation. However, their ﬂuxes are strongly correlated. The upﬂow region has lower density and lower
temperature than the active region core. In the upﬂow region, the Doppler velocity and non-thermal velocity show a strong correlation
in the coronal lines, but the correlation is not seen in the active region core. At the boundary between the upﬂow region and the active
region core, the upﬂow region shows an increase in the coronal non-thermal velocity, the emission obtained from the DEM, and the
domination of the redshifted regions in the chromosphere.
Conclusions. The obtained results suggest that at least three parallel mechanisms generate the plasma upﬂow: (1) the reconnection
between closed loops and open magnetic ﬁeld lines in the lower corona or upper chromosphere; (2) the reconnection between the
chromospheric small-scale loops and open magnetic ﬁeld; (3) the expansion of the magnetic ﬁeld lines that allows the chromospheric
plasma to escape to the solar corona.

1. Introduction

The solar atmosphere continuously generates streams of parti-
cles - the solar wind that creates space weather and the space
environment in the Solar System. These particles inﬂuence the
Earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere and can have a negative
impact on technology and astronauts’ health. The solar wind ve-
locity distribution presents two components of a diﬀerent origin.
The source of the fast solar wind (≈800 km/s at 1AU) is well
established to be coronal holes, but the origin of the slow solar
wind (≈300 km/s at 1AU) is still an open issue. The source of the
slow solar wind has been considered to emanate from the coronal
hole boundaries (Wang et al. 1990), helmet streamers (Einaudi
et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2000), or the edges of the active region
(Kojima et al. 1999; Sakao et al. 2007; Harra et al. 2008). In this

paper, we focus on the border between the active region and the
coronal hole to investigate the origins of the slow solar wind.

Doppler velocity maps, obtained at coronal temperatures, al-
ways show a plasma upﬂow at edges of active regions (Sakao
et al. 2007; Doschek et al. 2007, 2008; Del Zanna 2008; Hara
et al. 2008; Harra et al. 2008). The upﬂow regions have been
documented in all observations of active regions regardless of the
size and complexity and stage of evolution. Harra et al. (2017)
have investigated an upﬂow region during 3 solar rotations, but
Zangrilli & Poletto (2016) have found an upﬂow region that sur-
vived ﬁve solar rotations. The plasma upﬂows have been con-
sidered as a source of the solar wind (Sakao et al. 2007; Harra
et al. 2008). However, the physical processes that generate the
upﬂow regions are still not conﬁrmed, and the following scenar-
ios are considered: plasma circulation in the open coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld funnels (Marsch et al. 2008), impulsive heating at the

footpoints of AR loops (Harra et al. 2008), chromospheric evap-
oration due to reconnection driven by ﬂux emergence and braid-
ing by photospheric motions (Del Zanna 2008), chromospheric
jets and spicules (De Pontieu et al. 2009, 2017), Alfvén waves
triggered by magnetic reconnection (Wang et al. 2015), heating
events (Nishizuka & Hara 2011), expansion of large-scale re-
connecting loops (Harra et al. 2008), continual AR expansion
(Murray et al. 2010), the reconnection between the closed-loop
in the active region core and open magnetic ﬁeld lines create
strong pressure imbalances responsible for the plasma upﬂow
(Del Zanna et al. 2011), and the AR magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion partially uncovered by the streamers, that allows plasma to
easily escape (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2012).

Despite the upﬂow regions often being co-spatial with open
magnetic ﬁeld lines (Sakao et al. 2007; Harra et al. 2008), not all
of these regions are necessarily related to the outﬂow region and
not all of them are the source of the slow solar wind (Edwards
et al. 2016). The coronal outﬂows can originate from the places
with a strong gradient of magnetic connectivity, called Quasi-
Separatrix Layers (QSLs), where magnetic reconnection trans-
forms the closed magnetic ﬁeld loops into ’open’ ﬁeld or large-
scale loops (Baker et al. 2009, 2017). This magnetic ﬁeld topol-
ogy allows the coronal upﬂow material to escape and create the
solar wind (Sakao et al. 2007). Moreover, Brooks et al. (2020)
showed that there are two components of the outﬂow emission
in the active region: (1) a substantial contribution from expanded
plasma that appears to have been expelled from closed loops in
the active region core, (2) and a contribution from dynamic ac-
tivity in the active region plage, with a composition signature
that reﬂects solar photospheric abundances.

Several slow solar wind sources are considered; three main
scenarios are presented below (Abbo et al. 2016). (1) The expan-
sion model assumes that quasi-static long-lived open magnetic
ﬁeld topology allows plasma particle escape (Wang & Sheeley
1990; Wang 1994). This solar wind speed depends on the ﬂux
tube expansion; the faster expansion implied the slower speed.
In the active region edges, the ﬂux tube’s expansion is faster than
in the coronal hole; thus, the active region edges are a slow so-
lar wind source. (2) Interchange reconnection between the open
magnetic ﬁeld and closed-ﬁeld lines in the transition region eject
particles onto open magnetic ﬁeld lines creating the solar wind
(Fisk & Schwadron 2001). (3) The weak magnetic ﬁeld of the
streamer (pseudostreamer) cusp allows the material in the under-
lying closed ﬁeld-lines to escape as a result of the reconnection
(Einaudi et al. 1999; Rappazzo et al. 2005).

The origin of the coronal upﬂow region and its relation to the

solar atmosphere’s underlying layer is also an open question.

One important characteristic of the AR upﬂows is the blue-
ward asymmetries of coronal line proﬁles (Harra et al. 2008). In-
tensive investigations have been performed to understand these
asymmetries. The asymmetries also provide important clues on
the generation mechanisms of the upﬂows (Tian et al. 2011;
McIntosh et al. 2012). However, the mechanisms of the upﬂow
creation and location where in the solar atmosphere these mech-
anisms occur still remain undiscovered. In this work, we con-
centrate on the processes responsible for the upﬂow region cre-
ation and evolution. To address this, we study the evolution of
the plasma properties from the chromosphere through the transi-
tion region to the corona. For plasma diagnostics, we use spec-
troscopic data obtained simultaneously by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014) and Hin-
ode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (Hinode/EIS; Culhane et al.
2007). These observations allow us to analyse the plasma mo-
tions (Doppler velocity), and the excess line width above the

thermal width which is known as the non-thermal velocity. Many
scenarios have been considered to explain the non-thermal line
broadening: propagation of acoustic or MHD waves (Boland
et al. 1975; Coyner & Davila 2011), the small-scale magnetic
reconnection events -nanoﬂares (Parker 1988; Patsourakos &
Klimchuk 2006), unresolved laminar ﬂow along with diﬀerent
size loops (Athay & Dere 1991) and superposition of two or
more velocity components along the line of sight (the multiplic-
ity of line-of-sight velocities) (Chen et al. 2011; Tian et al. 2011).
Although many papers discuss the dependencies between the
intensity, Doppler shift, and non-thermal velocity in the upﬂow
region, there is little information on how these parameters and
their dependencies change with the line formation temperatures
from the chromosphere via transition region to the solar corona.
Several authors have investigated the temperature dependence of
the line parameters, but mainly focus on a narrow temperature
range. For instance, Del Zanna (2008); Tripathi et al. (2009);
Warren et al. (2011)) have performed a detailed study of the
Doppler velocities as a function of line formation temperature.
For a broader view, we analyse the evolution of the plasma prop-
erties in the upﬂow region in a wide range of temperatures that
covers the chromosphere, the transition region, and the corona
through the analysis of simultaneous observations obtained by
IRIS and Hinode (Sect. 2). We use maps of plasma parame-
ters to study their spatial distribution and relationships between
each other (Sect. 3, 4). Finally, we classify the most character-
istic spectra in the active region core and upﬂow region using
an artiﬁcial intelligence method to discuss diﬀerences observed
(Sect. 5). In Sect. 6, we discuss the relationships between the
plasma parameters observed in the diﬀerent spectral lines and
outline the main conclusion and suggestion for further analy-
sis. The methods presented in this work can be used to study
the high-resolution spectroscopic data (SPICE; Spice Consor-
tium et al. 2020) from the Solar Orbiter mission (Müller et al.
2013, 2020).

2. Data analysis

2.1. Observation

We analysed six datasets of the non-ﬂaring NOAA Active Re-
gion AR12687 obtained between 14 and 25 November 2017.
For each observation, we selected a region of interest (ROI)
in order to compare the properties of the upﬂow region and
the active region core (Fig. 1, Table 1). We used spectroscopic
data obtained simultaneously by IRIS and Hinode/EIS to study
the plasma properties. These analyses are carried out for the
temperature range from logT/K=3.8 to logT/K=6.3 (Table 2).
For reliable alignment between the Hinode and IRIS data, we
used the images obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assem-
bly (SDO/AIA; Lemen et al. 2012). The SDO/AIA data are also
used for the diﬀerential emission measure analysis (Sect. 3.5).

2.2. Hinode EIS

The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al. 2007) is
a scanning slit spectrometer on-board Hinode. The Hinode/EIS
observes the upper transition region and the solar corona in two
wavebands: 170-210Å and 250-290Å with a spectral resolution
0.0223Å per pixel. The Hinode/EIS can scan the ﬁeld of view up
to 9.3×8.5 arcmin with the narrowest slit and a spatial scale of 1
arcsec per pixel.

We downloaded the level-0 data from the Hinode/EIS

emission lines Fe xii (195.12Å), Fe xiii (202.04Å), and Fe xiv
(270.52Å, 274.20Å). Additionally, we used nine other spectral
lines obtained from EIS for the diﬀerential emission measure
analysis (Table 2, Sect. 3.5). To calibrate Hinode/EIS data, we
used a standard routine eis_prep that removed the CCD dark
current, cosmic rays pattern, hot and dusty pixels from the
detector exposures. This routine also provided the radiometric
calibration from the data number (DN) to the physical unit (erg
cm−2 s−1 sr−1 Å−1). Moreover, we applied the correction for the
slit tilt and the orbital variation of line position (Warren et al.
2014).

Using the eis_auto_ﬁt routine (Solar SoftWare, https:

//hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/hinode/eis/idl/

analysis/line_fitting/auto_fit/eis_auto_fit.pro),
we ﬁtted a single Gaussian function for Fe xii, Fe xiii, and Fe xiv
spectral lines at each spatial pixel. For the Fe xii lines, the χ2 test
and the velocity error shows that the single and double Gaussian
ﬁts present the same results for our ROIs, hence we chose to use
a single Gaussian ﬁt.

The ﬁtted parameters were used to generate the maps of the
peak intensity and Doppler velocity. Then, we converted the line-
of-sight Doppler velocity to the radial velocity using the direc-
tion cosine correction (µ = cos θ). The direction cosine correc-
tion is used to reduce the systematic component of the projection
eﬀect related to the solar rotation. Using the SolarSoft routine
eis_width2velocity, we computed the non-thermal velocity. This
routine is based on the equation: FWHM2 = (FWHMinstr)2 +
4ln(2)(λ\c)2(Vt +(Vnt)2), where FWHM -full width at half maxi-

2.3. IRIS

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pon-
tieu et al. 2014) is a space-based multi-channel
imaging-
spectrograph that investigates the chromosphere and the tran-
sition region. IRIS provides spectroscopic raster data of the
solar atmosphere in two far-ultraviolet channels (FUV) 1332-
1358Å and 1390-1406Å, and a near-ultraviolet channel (NUV)
2785-2835Å with a spectral sampling of 12.8 mÅ for FUV and
25.6 mÅ for NUV. The ﬁeld of view depends on the observation
mode, usually up to 135"x175", but larger raster are possible by
re-pointing the satellite.

We analysed level-2 data, downloaded from the IRIS
database (https://iris.lmsal.com/search/). These data
have been corrected for ﬂat ﬁeld and geometrical distortion and
the dark current has been subtracted. The automatic wavelength
calibration was conﬁrmed using the O i 1335.60Å line for FUVS
detector, the S i 1401.515Å for the FUVL detector, and Ni i
2799.474Å line for NUV detector. We focused on several lines
of Mg ii, C ii, and Si iv (Table 2). For all IRIS wavebands anal-
ysed in this paper, the raster data were binned to the spatial res-
olution of the Hinode/EIS, but the spectral resolution was not
modiﬁed. This binning increased the signal to noise ratio.

To obtain the intensity and the velocity of the Mg ii peaks, we
modiﬁed the iris_get_mg_features_lev2 routine to work with the
spatially binned data and restricted the velocity range to ±40 km
s−1. The missing data of intensity and velocity (ﬂagged NaN)
were replaced with the interpolated values from the four near-
est pixels. For the C ii and Si iv spectral lines, we ﬁtted a single
Gaussian proﬁle. From the ﬁtted parameters, we created the in-

tensity and Doppler velocity maps. In the last step, the line-of-
sight Doppler velocity maps were converted to radial velocity
map using the direction cosine correction µ = cos θ. The χ2 test
(IDL XSQ_TEST procedure) was used to test the goodness of
ﬁt for the C ii and Si iv line for each spatial pixel. We tested the
hypothesis that the given observed spectral line intensities are an
accurate approximation to the expected Gaussian intensity dis-
tribution and assumed hypothesis signiﬁcance level at 0.05 . For
further analysis, we used only the ﬁts that fulﬁlled this hypothe-
sis.

The Slit Jaw Imager (SJI) onboard IRIS provides contextual
images, showing the area surrounding the slit in four relatively
wide band-passes. The two channels of 55Å bandpass are cen-
tred at 1330Å and 1400Å, the other two channels of 4Å band-
pass are centred at 2796Å and 2832Å. We used the auxiliary SJI
1400Å images for data alignment (Sect. 2.5).

2.4. SDO: Atmospheric imaging assembly (AIA)

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) provides a continuous monitoring of the full-solar disk in
seven EUV and three UV channels that covers the solar atmo-
sphere from the photosphere to the corona. The AIA data are
obtained with a spatial scale of 0.6 arcsec per pixel and a tem-
poral resolution of 12 sec for EUV channels and 24 sec for UV
channels.

We used pre-processed SDO data provided by the Joint
Science Operations Center (JSOC; http://jsoc.stanford.
edu). The pre-processing option AIA_SCALE was applied.
Therefore, data have been corrected for proper plate scaling,
shifts, and rotation (i.e. equivalent to level-1.5 data).

To show context and for the alignment between Hinode/EIS
and IRIS observations, we used the images from SDO/AIA
304Å, 171Å, and 193Å channels (Table 2). Figure 1 shows the
active region’s context in AIA 193Å with the boxes represent-
ing the IRIS (white) and Hinode/EIS (blue) ﬁeld of view. The
Hinode/EIS ﬁeld of view (FOV) is larger than IRIS FOV hence
our region of interest is the latter (solid white box in Fig. 1).
The SDO/AIA images of 6 channels were used for diﬀerential
emission measure analysis (Sect. 3.5).

2.5. Data alignment

The high-precision alignment of the IRIS and Hinode/EIS data
has a direct inﬂuence on a comparison of the plasma proper-
ties from diﬀerent layers of the solar atmosphere. Hinode/EIS
observes signiﬁcantly hotter spectral lines than IRIS, and hence
in order to align accurately we used both SDO/AIA and IRIS
SJI 1400 observations. To keep the same spatial scale of all ob-
servations, we interpolated the IRIS and SDO/AIA data to the
Hinode/EIS spatial scale. Using a cross-correlation method, we
aligned the intensity maps of the lines with close formation tem-
perature. Hence, the maps were aligned according to the follow-
ing chain: Mg ii k2 - Mg ii k3 - C ii - Si iv -SJI1400 -AIA 304
-AIA 171 -AIA 193 - Fe xii - Fe xiii - Fe xiv. In this chain, the
IRIS raster data had a rigid instrumental alignment, similar to
the Fe xii and Fe xiii rasters from EIS. The Fe xiv line spectrum
is recorded on a diﬀerent CCD than Fe xii and Fe xiii lines and
the oﬀset between these two CCDs of Hinode/EIS is determined
using the routine eis_ccd_oﬀset.pro. Finally, IRIS and Hinode
data were aligned with the accuracy of the single Hinode/EIS
spatial pixel.

3. Results

3.1. Maps of intensity, velocity and non-thermal velocity

From the six spectroscopic observations presented in Fig. 1 (Ta-
ble 2), we chose the most representative one - the observation
obtained on 15 November 2017 to show detailed plots. This ob-
servation clearly shows the upﬂow region and the active region
core. The same analysis was carried out for all observations and
we present the statistical results for the rest of the observations.
Figures 2 and 3 show the intensity, velocity and non-thermal
velocity maps of the solar corona, transition region and chro-
mosphere observed on 15 November 2017. Based on the Fe xii
velocity map (Fig. 2), we deﬁned the upﬂow region as the
blue-shifted area with the Doppler velocity smaller than -5 km
s−1, and the active region core as the red-shifted area with the
Doppler velocity larger than 5 km s−1.

The velocity maps (Figs. 2) obtained from the coronal lines
(Fe xii, Fe xiii, and Fe xiv) are similar to each other. These maps
show two clear compact features - the blue-shifted upﬂow re-
gion and the red-shifted active region core. On the contrary to
the corona, the maps of the underlying layers (Si iv, C ii, Mg ii)
present a huge diversity of Doppler velocities and they are rich
in numerous small-scale features.

The intensity maps (Figs. 2, 3) show the bright active region
core and signiﬁcantly darker upﬂow region in the coronal lines.
In the transition region and chromosphere, the upﬂow region is
only slightly darker than the active region core. The Mg ii k2
line shows chromospheric network pattern (brighter than sur-
roundings) and internetwork regions (darker than surroundings)
that in the Mg ii k2 velocity map corresponds to redshifted and
blueshifted areas, respectively.

The non-thermal velocities (Figs. 2) were calculated only for
optically thin lines observed in the corona (Fe xii, Fe xiii, and
Fe xiv) and the transition region (Si iv). In the Fe xiii and Fe xiv
lines, the non-thermal velocity is larger in the upﬂow region than
in the active region core. In the Fe xii line, the non-thermal ve-
locity in the whole active region core and one-third of the up-
ﬂow region is stronger than 30 km s−1. In the rest of the up-
ﬂow region, the non-thermal velocity is below 30 km s−1. The
Fe xiii and Fe xii show stronger non-thermal velocity towards the
boundary in the upﬂow region suggesting that there are more
than one mechanism responsible for a non-thermal spectral line
broadening. The non-thermal velocity of Fe xii 195.12Å is gen-
erally larger in the AR core than in the upﬂow region. In contrast,
other corona lines (Fe xiii, Fe xiv) present the stronger average
non-thermal velocity in the upﬂow region than in the active re-
gion core. It is very likely caused that the Fe xii 195.12Å line
is blended with another line at 195.18Å. It is density sensitive
blend so the higher density active core implies the stronger line
width than in the upﬂow region where density is lower. More-
over, the upﬂow region and the active region core show similar
non-thermal velocities in the transition region (Si iv).

3.2. Mutual relation between intensity in closest line

and the active region core (right side of Table 3). These analyses
showed a strong correlation for all ROIs in all observations.

In the upﬂow region, we found strong correlations (left side
of Table 3), in a range from 0.57 to 0.99, between intensities
from the lines with close formation temperature. In each obser-
vation, the relationship between the transition region and coronal
lines (Si iv - Fe xii) is slightly weaker than that of other pairs, but
the correlation coeﬃcient is at least 0.57.

In the active region core, all pairs of spectral lines show
the correlation coeﬃcient around 0.5 or higher, but only in two
cases, the correlation is below 0.5 (0.43, 0.49). In general, we can
distinguish two groups of the spectral line pairs with the higher
correlation coeﬃcient. The coronal pairs present the correla-
tion higher than 0.85. The chromospheric and chromospheric-
transition region pairs have correlation higher than 0.71. Simi-
larly to the upﬂow region, the correlation between the transition
region and coronal lines are weaker than in other pairs; the cor-
relation coeﬃcient is below 0.5 in two observations. The nearby
limb observation from 24th and 25th November 2017 show a
low correlation between Fe xii and Si iv lines (Table 3). This low
correlation can be a result of the strong projection eﬀect.

The comparison of the intensity correlations of the pairs of
lines with close formation temperature in the upﬂow region and
active region core (Table 3) shows the same trends in both re-
gions, for example two groups of spectral lines with the higher
correlation (coronal and chromospheric-transition region) and
the weaker correlation between the transition region and coro-
nal line (Si iv - Fe XII). Moreover, we found a higher correlation
for the upﬂow region lines than for the active region core. The
high correlation coeﬃcients suggests a clear relation between
the structures observed in the close formation temperatures and
allows for analysis further plasma properties.

In general, we did not notice a signiﬁcant relationship be-
tween the ROI positions on the solar disk and the correlation
coeﬃcient. Still, for large inclination, the projection eﬀects can
be important (e.g. observation from 14, 24, and 25 November
2017).

3.3. Relationship between velocities in pairs of lines with

close formation temperature

To quantify the dependence between the Doppler velocities in
the closest formation temperature lines, we used the same cor-
relation measure as in Sect. 3.2. Table 4 presents the correlation
between Doppler velocities for the upﬂow region (left side) and
the active region core (right side).

In the upﬂow region, the coronal (Fe xii) and transition re-
gion (Si iv) velocities show very weak correlation. This is be-
cause, the Si iv is mostly red-shifted, whereas the Fe xii is blue-
shifted. We also found a weak correlation between the Doppler
velocities of the C ii and Mg ii k3 lines.

The pair of the coronal lines (Fe xiii and Fe xii) are well cor-
related, but the correlation decreases towards higher tempera-
tures (Fe xiv and Fe xiii). We also noticed a strong correlation
for the pair of the transition region lines (C ii-Si iv) and the pair
of the chromospheric lines (Mg ii k3 and C ii).

To quantify the relation between the plasma properties of pairs
of spectral lines with close formation temperatures (e.g. Fe xii
and Fe xiii lines), we used Pearson’s linear correlation coeﬃ-
cient. This coeﬃcient has a value in the range from -1 (negative
correlation) to 1 (positive correlation), while 0 deﬁnes the lack
of correlation. We calculated this correlation coeﬃcient between
the intensities of pairs of spectral lines with close formation tem-
peratures separately for the upﬂow region (left side of Table 3)

The velocities measured in the active region core and the up-
ﬂow region presents almost the same trends. However, the cor-
relation between the coronal (Fe xii) and transition region (Si iv)
velocities is stronger in the active region core compare with the
upﬂow region ones.

Table 4 shows that the velocity correlations in the upﬂow
region are stronger nearby the disk centre and weaker towards to
limb. We did not notice this eﬀect in the active region core.

3.4. Ratio between the average intensities of downﬂow and

upﬂow regions.

We calculated the ratio of the average active region core inten-
sity to the upﬂow region intensity separately for each observa-
tion and at each spectral line. Table 5 shows that the intensity
ratio increases with the growing line formation temperatures and
reaches its highest value in the corona. In the corona, the active

region core is always brighter than the upﬂow region (from 1.5
to 5.6 times) and usually at least two times brighter than in the
transition region and chromosphere. The ratio sharply decreases
to around one in the transition region; thus, there the active re-
gion core and the upﬂow region present similar brightness. In the
chromosphere, the upﬂow region usually is slightly brighter than
the active region core, or both regions have similar brightness.
Thus, this similarity of intensity in chromosphere can suggest
comparable chromospheric heating in the upﬂow region and the
active region core, but further investigations are needed.

3.5. Differential Emission Measure and density diagnostics

(cid:17)−1

(cid:16) dT
dh

The Diﬀerential Emission Method (DEM) provides informa-
tion about the plasma distribution in temperature throughout
the atmosphere along the line-of-sight. The DEM is deﬁned:
DEM = n2
and depends on ne -electron density, T -
e
temperature, h-height along the line-of-sight. We performed a
DEM analysis for the observation of 15 November based on
SDO/AIA images of 94Å, 131Å, 171Å, 193Å, and 211Å, 335Å
channels. We used the regularized DEM inversion method pre-
pared by Hannah & Kontar (2012). To this aim, we chose a set of
near-simultaneous images obtained at 14:46:03 UT 15 Novem-
ber 2017. The SDO/AIA images from all the above-mentioned
channels were spatially aligned with single SDO/AIA pixel ac-
curacy. In our calculation, we took into account the photon noise
and readout noise.

upﬂow region, the DEM increases towards the boundary with the
active region core.

Additionally, we carried out a DEM analysis based on the
observation of 15 November using Hinode/EIS data. We used
all available spectral lines: He ii (256.312Å), Fe viii (185.213),
Fe x (184.536Å, 257.262Å), Fe xi (180.401Å), Fe xii (186.880Å,
193.509Å, 195.119Å), Fe xiii (202.044Å), Fe xiv (274.203Å),
Fe xvi (262.984Å), Ca xvii (192.858Å). He ii
line, optically
thick, is used as a lower-limit constraint on the low tempera-
ture part of the DEM and it is not relevant for the coronal results
we focus on. We pre-processed Hinode/EIS data with a standard
routine described in Sect. 2. Based on the pre-processed data, the
average intensity and their error were computed for the active
region core and upﬂow region for 12 spectral lines, separately.
Then, we computed DEM(T) curves for the active region core
and upﬂow region using the CHIANTI method (Del Zanna et al.
2021).

The DEM curves shows the strongest emission in the up-
ﬂow region at logT/K=6.1 and in the active region core at
logT/K=6.25. Moreover, the upﬂow region presents less emis-
sion than the active region core. Therefore, the DEM analy-
sis of EIS data are consistent with the DEM analysis based on
SDO/AIA observation. To clarify, the peak of the DEM for the
active region core seems low (logT/K=6.3). This is because the
intensities were averaged over the whole active core region so
the contribution from higher temperature loops (logT/K=6.6 -
see e.g. Warren et al. (2012)) is washed out.

We found a plasma density of 1.05 · 109cm−3 in the upﬂow
region. In the active region core, the plasma density was 1.38 ·
1010cm−3 (13 times larger than in the upﬂow region).

4. Non-thermal velocity

We computed non-thermal velocity only for the optically thin
lines: Si iv, Fe xii, Fe xiii and Fe xiv.

The DEM maps (Fig. 4) show the strongest emission in the
upﬂow region at logT/K=5.9-6.0 and in the active region core at
logT/K=6.3. This suggests that the upﬂow region is built from
cooler plasma than the active region core. Moreover, the upﬂow
region presents less emission from the transition region tempera-
tures than the active region core (logT/K=5.6-5.8). The emission
distribution suggests that the dominant part of the upﬂow plasma
is generated in the upper transition region or lower corona. In the

4.1. Relation between Doppler velocity and non-thermal

velocity

To analyse the relationship between the Doppler velocity and
non-thermal velocity, we prepared a 2D histogram of the prob-
ability density function (PDF) of Si iv, Fe xii, Fe xiii, and Fe xiv
lines. For the observation of 15 November, the PDF diagrams
show a linear relationship between the non-thermal velocity and

tion the coronal lines. We used the non-linear Spearman’s rank
order correlation between for the active region core (Fig. 6). The
analogical analysis was carried out with all observations (Ta-
ble 6). In the upﬂow region (Fig. 6 top, Table 6 left side), the PDF
diagrams show negative correlation in the coronal temperatures
(Fe xii, Fe xiii and Fe xiv) and lack of dependencies in the transi-
tion region (Si iv). The negative correlation arises from the fact
that we have chosen upﬂows to be represented by negative num-
bers, as compared with the positive numbers and correlation for
downﬂows. The strong negative correlation between the Doppler
velocity and non-thermal velocity in the upﬂow region suggests
that the processes responsible for non-thermal line broadening
strongly inﬂuence upﬂow in the solar corona. This correlation
has been explained as a natural consequence of the superpo-
sition of high-speed upﬂow on the nearly static coronal back-
ground (Tian et al. 2011), or superposition of multiple upﬂows
with slightly shifted velocities (Doschek et al. 2007; Doschek
2012). However, it is also possible in the other way that if there is
an upﬂow, there may generated more turbulence on small scales.

In the active region core, we noticed the weak correlation or
lack of correlation for Fe xii, Fe xiii, and Fe xiv lines and posi-
tive correlation (of around 0.5) for Si iv lines. Thus, the closed
magnetic ﬁeld line topology of the active region core reduces the
relation between the Doppler velocity and non-thermal velocity,
possibly because the plasma motion is restricted within closed
magnetic ﬁelds. The open magnetic ﬁeld lines topology of the
upﬂow region allows for more freedom of the ionised plasma
motion. Therefore, we suggest that the non-thermal velocity is a
result of the multiplicity of the line-of-sight velocities. More-
over, stronger absolute Doppler velocity implies higher non-
thermal velocity that can be related for example to increasing
turbulence.

Fig. 6. Probability density functions (PDFs) for the non-thermal velocity and Doppler velocity relation for the upﬂow region (upper panels) and
the active region core (bottom panels) for the observation from 15 November 2017. For the upﬂow region panels (top row), the number in the right
corner shows the linear correlation coeﬃcient. For the active region core panels (bottom row), the number in the right corner presents a non-linear
Spearman’s rank correlation. The panel of the Si iv line in the active region core shows a dichotomy. Thus, we additionally calculated the non-linear
correlation coeﬃcient separately for the negative, positive and absolute Doppler velocity and received -0.39, 0.74, and 0.62, respectively.

4.2. Comparison of the average Doppler and non-thermal

velocities in the upﬂow region and the active region core

We compared the average Doppler and non-thermal velocities
computed separately for the upﬂow region and the active region
core. We ordered the average Doppler velocity according to the
increasing line formation temperature and presented in Fig. 7a
for the upﬂow region (blue) and the active region core (red). In
the solar corona, the upﬂow region is always blueshifted, and the
active region core is redshifted. We found almost the same veloc-
ities for the upﬂow region and the active region core in the tran-
sition region and chromosphere. The average Doppler velocities
distribution in the upﬂow region suggests that at least one upﬂow
mechanism is located between Si iv (upper transition region) and
Fe xii (lower corona) lines formation temperature. Several previ-
ous studies (Teriaca et al. 1999; Peter & Judge 1999; Dadashi
et al. 2011) present the distribution of the average Doppler ve-
locity with line formation temperature for active regions, quiet
Sun, or the whole solar disk. However, only few papers focus
on the average Doppler velocity distribution in an upﬂow region
(e.g. Del Zanna 2008; Polito et al. 2020).

We analysed non-thermal velocities in the same way as the
Doppler velocities. They are presented in Fig. 7b and ordered
with the growing line formation temperatures (Fig. 7b). In the
coronal lines, the non-thermal velocities are higher in the upﬂow
region than in the active region core. Moreover, in the coronal
lines, the non-thermal velocities show a huge diversity from less
than 10 km s−1 in the active region core to almost 40 km s−1 in
the upﬂow region. There is a general resemblance with Doppler

velocity, the non-thermal velocity for Fe xiii is usually lower than
in Fe xii and Fe xiv lines. In the transition region (Si iv line),
the non-thermal velocities are in a range of 17-22 km s−1 for
both the upﬂow region and the active region core. The analysis
of the average non-thermal velocity suggests that the magnetic
ﬁeld topology has a strong inﬂuence on the non-thermal broad-
ening. In the solar corona, the non-thermal velocity is stronger
in the upﬂow region dominated by the open magnetic ﬁeld lines,
compared to the active region core governed by closed corona
loops. In general, the relation between the non-thermal velocity
and the line formation temperature was investigated in several
papers (Chae et al. 1998; Peter 2001; Brooks & Warren 2016).
However, we did not ﬁnd a distribution of the non-thermal ve-
locity with the line formation temperature for an upﬂow region
in previous papers.

5. Spectra classiﬁcation

We used an unsupervised algorithm known as the k-means clus-
tering algorithm to identify groups of similar spectral proﬁles
(MacQueen 1967). For a detailed description of an application
on IRIS spectra, see Panos et al. (2018). The IRIS level-2 raster
data were binned to the Hinode spatial scale, but the spectral res-
olution was not modiﬁed. Each spectrum was then normalised
by its maximum intensity value before using the k-means algo-
rithm separately on Mg ii, C ii, and Si iv spectra. The number of
groups is often an ill deﬁned parameter, however, there exists
several methods that can provide an estimation of this quan-

tity. In this regard, we use the elbow method, which tracks the
decrease in variance while incrementally increasing the group
number (Thorndike 1953). We obtained 8 groups for Mg ii, 8
groups for C ii and 8 groups for Si iv, with each group contain-
ing spectra with a similar shape.

Figure 8 shows the representative Mg ii proﬁles of the 8
groups and the map presents the distribution of the groups in the
active region. Group 1-4 (violet-light blue) are characteristics for
the upﬂow region; among them group 4 (light blue) is the most
common. Group 8 (red) is the most representative of the active
region. In groups 1-3, the right peaks of Mg ii k2 and h2 are
stronger than the left one, which indicates the blueshift, but in
the spectra of groups 4,5 and 8, the left peak is stronger, which
indicates redshift (Pereira et al. 2013). Therefore, in the chromo-
sphere of the upﬂow region we ﬁnd blueshifted and redshifted
areas. Moreover, in the upﬂow region, the position of group 4
(redshifted) corresponds well to the area with a non-thermal ve-
locity of the Fe xii line stronger than its surroundings (Fig. 2).
Therefore, we suggest that group 4 points a region with the re-
connection between active region closed loops and open mag-
netic ﬁeld lines of the upﬂow region, especially that this group
is located on the border between the active region core and the
upﬂow region.

Comparing groups 4 and 8, we found that the upﬂow region
spectra present deeper central reversal at the Mg ii k3 and Mg ii
h3 lines centre than the spectra in the active region core. How-

ever, further investigations are needed to explain the central re-
versal diﬀerence between the upﬂow region and active region
core.

The maps of the groups of the characteristic spectra distri-
bution for C ii and Si iv lines are discussed in more depth in the
Appendix A. These maps suggest that the spectra groups of Mg ii
lines can correspond with the location and shape of the spectra
groups of C ii lines and Si iv lines. This implies that the struc-
tures and physical processes in the chromosphere and transition
region are dependent on each other. However, the investigation
of other regions are necessary to test the relation between the
spectral groups from the diﬀerent spectral lines.

6. Discussion and conclusion

In this paper, we have analysed the plasma properties in the up-
ﬂow region and the active region core. The plasma properties
in the upﬂow region have been investigated before by many au-
thors (Sect. 1). We extended the analysis to a broader tempera-
ture range covering the solar atmosphere from the chromosphere
to the corona. We summarise the most important results of our
analysis below:

– The Doppler velocities between adjacent temperature ions in
the upﬂow region show no correlation between the corona
and the transition region but a very strong correlation in the
corona. The upﬂow plasma is dominant in the corona.

spectra classiﬁed into 8 groups. The blue line indicates the centroid of k-means, the blue-red line presents the average spectral line proﬁle, and the
grey lines show the variance of all proﬁles in the group. The color of the rectangle in the spectra corresponds to the color indicating the location
of the spectrum in the distribution map (top right panel). The white contours of the distribution map outline the ±5 km s−1 plasma ﬂow in Fe xii,
thus indicating the position of the upﬂow region and the active region core.

– The ratio between intensity of the core and upﬂow region
is high in the upper corona reaching over 5, whereas it is
around 1 in the chromosphere. The upﬂow region has low
corona density, but the density is similar between the core
and upﬂow region in the lower atmosphere.

– The DEM analysis indicates the upﬂow region has a domi-
nant temperature of log T=5.9-6.1, whereas the active region
core is dominant from log T=6.2-6.4. The upﬂow regions are
cool, and the emission is strongest closest to the boundary
with the active region.

– The Doppler velocity and non-thermal velocity show a
strong correlation in the coronal lines in the upﬂow region
– a correlation that is not seen in the active region core. The
strength of this relationship may be due to the open ﬁeld lines
in the upﬂow region.

– The relationship between both Doppler velocity and non-
thermal velocity with temperature has been explored before
(e.g. Brooks & Warren (2016)). In our case the upﬂow region
deviates in its temperature behaviour above 1MK.

– In the upﬂow region of the chromosphere, there are both
red and blueshifted regions, with the redshifted region be-
ing more dominant closer to the active region boundary. This
is where the strongest non-thermal velocity is seen in the
corona.

– In the upﬂow region, for each of the investigated spectral
lines (Mg ii, C ii and Si iv) we found several groups of the
spectral lines that spatially correspond to each other. Thus,
we suggest that more than one process is responsible for the
upﬂow.

Based on the previous papers (Sect. 1) and our results, we
suggest three parallel processes that together can generate the
plasma upﬂow (Fig. 9):

1. the interchange reconnection between the open magnetic
ﬁeld lines of the upﬂow region and closed magnetic ﬁeld
lines (loops) of the active region core in the solar corona;
2. the reconnection between the small-scale loops in the chro-

mosphere and the open magnetic ﬁeld lines;

3. expansion of the open magnetic ﬁeld lines from the photo-
sphere to the corona allows for the plasma upﬂow due to the
waves in the lower solar atmosphere.

We review each of these three options and describe in which
location and why our observations are consistent with each sce-
nario. Previous papers (e.g. Peter 2001; Tian et al. 2009) present
cartoons of the coronal funnels in the quiet Sun or coronal holes.
Our sketch (Fig. 9) extends these cartoons for an upﬂow region
considering diﬀerent upﬂow scenarios.

6.3. Expansion of the open magnetic ﬁeld lines from the

open magnetic ﬁeld lines in the solar corona

chromosphere to the corona

In the upﬂow region, our analysis shows strong blueshift in the
corona and redshift in the transition region (Sect. 3.1). This im-
plies no correlation between the coronal and transition region
velocities in the upﬂow region (Sect. 3.3) as noticed in the pre-
vious studies for example Warren et al. (2011); Ugarte-Urra &
Warren (2011).

The DEM analysis (Sect. 3.5) indicates the stronger emission
closest to the boundary between the upﬂow region and the active
region. This is where the strongest non-thermal velocity is seen
in the corona (Sect. 3.1), and the redshifted region dominates in
the chromosphere.

We suggest that reconnection occurs between the open mag-
netic ﬁeld lines and closed magnetic ﬁeld loops in the upper
transition region or the lower solar corona (Fig. 9, scenario 1).
As a result of reconnection, plasma is injected towards the solar
corona and photosphere that generates upﬂow (blueshift) in the
corona and downﬂow (redshift) in the transition region, respec-
tively. The chromospheric redshift can be interpreted as the foot-
print of the plasma downﬂow generated during the reconnection.
However, the increasing magnetic ﬁeld concentrations towards
the photosphere decelerate this plasma; thus, the chromospheric
line’s plasma velocities are closer to 0 km/s than in the transition
region. The interchange reconnection should be especially eﬃ-
cient close to the border between the active region core and the
upﬂow region where the open and closed magnetic ﬁeld lines
meet each other. As a result of the reconnection, the emission
increases, hence the DEM increases too. The turbulence related
to reconnection can increase non-thermal line broadening (Gor-
dovskyy et al. 2016).

We received the plasma speed in the upﬂow region that is
signiﬁcantly lower than the Alfvén speed (Régnier et al. 2008).
However, measured reconnection upﬂow speed, even during
ﬂares, are not at the Alfvén speed too that is conﬁrmed in var-
ious papers for example Wang et al. (2017). Moreover, the de-
termining of the Alfvén speed is tricky as well Régnier et al.
(2008). Chromospheric evaporation also shows the speed lower
than the Alfvén speeds as presented by Warren (2006) used
a multi-thread model. This discrepancy can be explained that
within spectral line broadening can exist multiple diﬀerent blue
shift components.

6.2. The reconnection between the small-scale loops and the

open magnetic ﬁeld lines in the chromosphere

The Doppler velocity maps of the transition region lines in the
upﬂow region are dominated by the redshift structures, but these
maps consists also small-scale blueshifted patches (Sect. 3.1).
The blueshifted structures in the transition lines of the upﬂow re-
gion were noticed in the previous papers, for example Del Zanna
(2008); He et al. (2010). However, some of the transition region
blueshifted patches spatially correspond to the redshifted area in
the chromospheric lines. Moreover, our analysis showed a strong
correlation of the Doppler velocities of Si iv - C ii lines and line,
a weaker correlation for C ii - Mg ii k3 lines and stronger for
Mg ii k3 - Mg ii k2 lines (Sect. 3.3).

We suggest, the reconnection between the chromospheric
loops and the open magnetic ﬁeld lines (Fig. 9, scenario 2)
causes the upﬂow above the reconnection place (above the up-
per chromosphere) and the downﬂow below it (middle chromo-
sphere and below).

The Doppler velocity maps show spatially corresponding small-
scale blueshifted patches in the chromosphere (Mg ii) and tran-
sition region (Si iv) of the upﬂow region. These blueshifted ar-
eas are especially well visible in the internetwork of Mg ii k2
(Sect. 3.1).

We suggest that in the upﬂow region, the open magnetic ﬁeld
expands from the photosphere to the corona. Therefore, plasma
can easily escape from the chromosphere to the corona and fur-
ther along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines even when there is no
reconnection. The propagation of the waves in the lower solar
atmosphere can accelerate the plasma upﬂow (Fig. 9, scenario
3). Thus, a blueshift observed from the chromosphere via transi-
tion region to the solar corona is the most characteristic pattern
of the upﬂow generated by the expanding open ﬂux tubes mech-
anism.

Polito et al. (2020) found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in spectral
signatures below the upﬂows compared to the core of an AR ob-
served by IRIS. For example, they noticed blueshifts in the chro-
mosphere (Mg ii, C ii), and smaller redshifts and the presence of
blueshifts in the transition region (Si iv) below the coronal up-
ﬂows (Fe xii). This connection between the chromosphere, tran-
sition region, and corona suggests that the expanding magnetic
ﬁeld scenario can allow jets and spicules to create the upﬂow.

6.4. Comparison of the upﬂow region and the active region

core

The spectral proﬁle shape classiﬁcation (Sect. 5) shows a clear
diﬀerence between the upﬂow region and the active region core
in the chromosphere (Mg ii, C ii) and transition region (Si iv).
We distinguished several groups of the Mg ii proﬁles. Proﬁles
within the same group are similar, but proﬁles from diﬀerent
groups consists of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent spectra. We noticed the
stronger central reversal of Mg ii k3 and Mg iih3 in the upﬂow re-
gion than in the active region core. To understand the Mg ii line
properties and also explain the deep central reversal diﬀerences
between the upﬂow region and the active region core, we require
additional observations and simulations.

The ratio between the intensity of the core and upﬂow region
(Sect. 3.4) shows that the coronal plasma density is lower in the
upﬂow region than in the active region core. Moreover, the DEM
analysis (Sect. 3.5) indicates that the coronal plasma is cooler in
the upﬂow region than in the active region core. The open mag-
netic ﬁeld structures dominate the upﬂow region. But the active
region core is rich in the coronal loops, closed magnetic ﬁeld
structures preventing the plasma from escaping. Therefore, in
the upﬂow region the plasma can escape more readily into space,
hence, the density and temperature of the coronal plasma in the
upﬂow region are lower than in the active region core. However,
in the chromosphere and the transition region, the feeds of the
diﬀerent coronal structures look the same (Peter 2001), hence
the average intensity of the active region core and upﬂow region
are similar.

The Doppler and non-thermal velocity change with the grow-
ing line formation temperature (Sect. 4.2). The increase of the
negative Doppler velocity in the upﬂow region with tempera-
ture is due to the plasma acceleration in the open magnetic ﬁeld
lines. Considering the two-component (Tian et al. 2011) or three-
component scenarios (McIntosh et al. 2012), there is an alterna-
tive interpretation of this observational result: the diﬀerent rel-
ative contributions of the fast upﬂow component and the cool-

ing downﬂow component at diﬀerent temperatures (Wang et al.
2013). The deviation of the non-thermal velocity in the temper-
ature above 1MK suggests that diﬀerent mechanisms can be re-
sponsible for the non-thermal heating in the upﬂow region and
the active region core.

The strong correlation between the Doppler and non-thermal
velocity (Sect. 4.1) observed in the coronal line of the upﬂow
region and a lack of this correlation in the active region core
suggest that the magnetic ﬁeld topology can have a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the non-thermal heating mechanism. It is also pos-
sible that in these two region, there are diﬀerent non-thermal
heating mechanisms at work. However, it is diﬃcult to point out
which non-thermal heating mechanism plays a dominant role in
our ROIs. Thus, further investigation of the non-thermal velocity
is necessary.

core and the upﬂow region (left side) and the description of the plasma ﬂow in each region that corresponds to the blue (upﬂow) and red (downﬂow)
arrows on the left side. The active region core is built with the hot coronal loop (yellow). The open magnetic ﬁeld topology is characteristic for
the upﬂow region (grey). In the chromosphere exists numerous small-scale loops (yellow). The numbers describe the processes responsible for the
upﬂow generation. (1) The reconnection between the closed loop and open magnetic ﬁeld lines (orange X) in the upper transition region or lower
corona. Due to reconnection, plasma is injected towards the corona and chromosphere. The magnetic ﬁeld increases towards the chromosphere and
can decelerate the plasma ﬂow in this direction. (2) The reconnection between the small-scale chromospheric loop and open magnetic ﬁeld lines
(orange X). Due to reconnection, plasma is injected towards the lower chromosphere and the transition region. The expanding open magnetic ﬁelds
lines allow the plasma propagate further to the corona. (3) The open magnetic ﬁeld structures allows plasma to escape from the chromosphere
through the transition region to the solar corona. This process is accelerated by waves propagated in the lower solar atmosphere.

Appendix A: Spectra classiﬁcation

We used the k-means method to classify the groups of similar
spectral lines in an analogous way as in Sect. 2. Figure A.1
shows the representative spectra and their distribution map for
Si iv (a) and C ii (b) lines. These maps show that the upﬂow re-
gion group of spectral lines in Fig. 8 (group 4, light blue) clearly
corresponds to groups 3 and 4 (blue) in Si iv (Fig. A.1a) and
groups 4 (blue) and 5 (green) in C ii (Fig. A.1b). The relationship
between the active region core groups is even stronger, group 8
(red) in Fig. 8 corresponds to Si iv group 8 (red) in Fig. A.1a and
C ii group 8 (red) in Fig. A.1b.

Fig. A.1. The groups of the most characteristics spectra of Si iv(a) and C ii (b). The small panels show the most characteristics spectra in 8 groups
for Si iv (a) and 8 groups of C ii (b). The blue line indicates the most characteristic proﬁle (the centroid of k-means), the blue-red line presents the
average spectral line proﬁle, and the grey line presents all proﬁles in the group. The colour of the rectangular box (right top of the spectra panel)
indicates the spectrum’s location in the distribution map (top right panel). The white contours of the distribution map present the ±5 km s−1 plasma
ﬂow in Fe xii, thus indicating the upﬂow region’s position and the active region core.
