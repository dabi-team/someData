Abstract
We studied the emergence process of 42 active region (ARs) by analyzing the
time derivative, R(t), of the total unsigned ﬂux. Line-of-sight magnetograms
acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were used. A continuous piecewise linear ﬁtting
to the R(t)-proﬁle was applied to detect an interval, ∆t2, of nearly-constant
R(t) covering one or several local maxima. The averaged over ∆t2 magnitude
of R(t) was accepted as an estimate of the maximal value of the ﬂux growth
rate, RMAX, which varies in a range of (0.5-5)×1020 Mx hour-1 for active regions
with the maximal total unsigned ﬂux of (0.5-3)×1022 Mx. The normalized ﬂux
growth rate, RN, was deﬁned under an assumption that the saturated total
unsigned ﬂux, F MAX, equals unity. Out of 42 ARs in our initial list, 36 event were
successfully ﬁtted and they form two subsets (with a small overlap of 8 events):
the ARs with a short (<13 hours) interval ∆t2 and a high (>0.024 hour-1)
normalized ﬂux emergence rate, RN, form the ”rapid” emergence event subset.
The second subset consists of ”gradual” emergence events and it is characterized
by a long (>13 hours) interval ∆t2 and a low RN (<0.024 hour-1). In diagrams of
RMAX plotted versus F MAX, the events from diﬀerent subsets are not overlapped
and each subset displays an individual power law. The power law index derived
from the entire ensemble of 36 events is 0.69±0.10. The ”rapid” emergence is

consistent with a ”two-step” emergence process of a single twisted ﬂux tube.
The ”gradual” emergence is possibly related to a consecutive rising of several
ﬂux tubes emerging at nearly the same location in the photosphere.

1. Introduction

Emergence of new active regions (ARs) is believed to be manifestation of the
solar dynamo action deep in the convective zone (Babcock, 1961; Leighton,
1969). Parker (1975) suggested that a magnetic Ω-shaped ﬂux tube emerges due
to magnetic buoyancy under the resistance of aerodynamic drag. The process
is not available for direct observations, so methods of numerical simulations are
still the main source of information on the details of the emergence process.

Signiﬁcant progress was made since the ﬁrst two-dimensional magnetohydro-
dynamic (MHD) simulations of ﬂux emergence performed by Schuessler (1979).
Thus, Spruit (1981) suggested a thin-ﬂux-tube approximation, and Moreno-
Insertis and Emonet (1996) and Emonet and Moreno-Insertis (1998) performed
compressible MHD simulations for a twisted ﬂux tube. Flux emergence in the
turbulent convective zone (CZ) was also simulated in the framework of the
anelastic approximation (e.g., Jouve and Brun (2009) and references therein).
However, according to Fan (2009), the approximation does not work for the
upper CZ (above 0.95 solar radius) due to large gradients of physical parameters.
The upper 20 Mm of the CZ thus became the focus of intense research eﬀorts.
Thus, Archontis et al. (2004) proposed a two-step-emergence model where
a twisted ﬂux rope, driven by buoyancy emerges from the depth of -20 Mm
and slows down as it reaches the photosphere because the unmagnetized plasma
becomes trapped between the rising ﬂux and the photosphere hindering further
emergence. During the intermediate phase, slow rise of the magnetized plasma is
accompanied by enhanced expansion in the transverse direction. The second step
of emergence is a runway expansion into the corona due to buoyant instability
(see Figures 5 and 7 in Archontis et al. (2004)). The model was later elaborated
in the framework of 2D and 3D compressible MHD simulations by Toriumi and
Yokoyama (2010, 2011).

Cheung, Sch¨ussler, and Moreno-Insertis (2007) and Cheung et al. (2008) ex-
plored the ﬂux emergence process through the top layers of the CZ and the
photosphere using 3D radiative MHD simulations and taking into account the
eﬀect of compressibility, energy exchange via radiative transfer, and partial ion-
ization. Only ARs with the total magnetic ﬂux less than 1020 Mx (a typical ﬂux of
an ephemeral region (Hagenaar, 2001)) were considered. The comparison of the
simulation results with Hinode observations (Cheung et al., 2008) demonstrated
the success of the simulations. Counterparts of observed high-speed down-ﬂows,
bright points, anomalous darkenings, transient kilogauss horizontal ﬁelds were
reproduced by the model and explained. Moreover, Cheung et al. (2008) have
shown that the rate of emergence (the rate of transport of the longitudinal
ﬂux) is higher for the more twisted ﬂux tubes. The undulating behavior of the

ﬁeld lines connecting the poles of a magnetic dipole (serpentine ﬁeld lines) was
demonstrated in the simulations as well. Authors argue that convective dynamics
of photospheric granules is responsible for this eﬀect that is ubiquitous in obser-
vations of ﬂux emergence. In Cheung et al. (2010) the serpentine pattern as well
as the lateral expansion of magnetic ﬂux is demonstrated in case of emergence of
a semi-torus. The process of ﬂux emergence, sunspots formation, and subsequent
decay was recently modeled by Rempel and Cheung (2014) starting from the rise
of a semi-torus shaped magnetic ﬂux of 1.7·1022 Mx from the depth of 15.5 Mm.
Authors have shown that large-scale subsurface ﬂows can aﬀect the resulting
emerged magnetic structure.

The above brief discussion of the most relevant theoretical works is by no
means a comprehensive review of numerical simulation eﬀorts aimed to model
the ﬂux emergence on the Sun. For an extended review, we recommend the
Living Review in Solar Physics by Cheung and Isobe (2014).

Impressive achievements of numerical simulations should be compared with
observations and explain observed features, as they do frequently. However, for
the further progress, eﬀorts in opposite direction are desirable, i.e., character-
istics of ﬂux emergence that follow from observations, should complement the
modeling progress.

When analyzing ﬂux emergence using observations, one of the essential pa-
rameters to study is the total unsigned ﬂux and its time variations. Frequently
the time derivative of the total unsigned ﬂux, the ﬂux emergence rate or ﬂux
growth rate, is explored as well.

Otsuji et al. (2011) studied 101 ﬂux emergence events ranging from small
ephemeral regions to large ARs by using Hinode/SOT ﬁltergrams and mag-
netograms. They calculated the ﬂux growth rate as the ratio of the saturated
unsigned ﬂux to the total emergence time and considered this value as the aver-
age ﬂux growth rate, < dF/dt >= F MAX/T . A relationship between < dF/dt >
0.57. Under a set of simpliﬁcations it
and F MAX was found: < dF/dt >∝ F MAX
was shown that the index should be 0.5, which is close to 0.57. Authors consider
this inference as a partial conﬁrmation of an elaborated physical view of the
solar ﬂux emergence.

Centeno (2012) studied the early emergence of two moderate-size ARs using
SDO/HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld data and Doppler velocities focusing on moving
dipolar features observed between the leading and following parts of an AR.
Their observed characteristics can be well explained in the framework of Cheung
et al. (2010) modeling that predicts unavoidable appearance of serpentine-like
ﬁeld lines responsible for near-surface reconnection and the discharge of mass
from rising magnetic ﬂux tubes.

Khlystova (2013) studied emergence during the ﬁrst ∆t = 12 hours since the
ﬁrst appearance of a new ﬂux using SOHO/MDI magnetograms and Doppler-
grams of 224 emerging ARs. The ﬂux emergence rate, dF/dt, was derived as
the ratio of the maximum (during ∆t) unsigned magnetic ﬂux, F MAX, and the
interval length, ∆t. Their scatter plot (Figure 8 in Khlystova (2013)) allows
to infer a power law relationship between the F MAX and dF/dt with an index
of about 0.4. Author explained the weak dependence between the parameters
suggesting that ARs emerge slowly and gradually fragment after fragment during

a rather long time period (frequently up to several days), and the ﬂux growth rate
derived from the ﬁrst half-day of emergence is not a comprehensive characteristic
of an AR as a whole.

Toriumi, Hayashi, and Yokoyama (2014) utilized SDO/HMI data for 23 emerg-
ing ARs to study horizontal divergent ﬂows that are expected to accompany the
emergence process according to the two-step emergence scenario (Archontis et
al., 2004). In 13 cases, these ﬂows were detected 30-100 minutes prior to the
emergence onset. Authors suggested that the observed consecutive peaks are
likely to indicate bifurcation of the emerging magnetic ﬂux, which may consist
of separate ﬂux bundles (Zwaan, 1985). However, these authors did not remove
the well known artiﬁcial 24-hour oscillations in the magnetic ﬂux (see, e.g.,
Liu et al. (2012); Smirnova et al. (2013); Kutsenko and Abramenko (2016)) so
that the resulting time proﬁles of the ﬂux growth rate are contaminated by
artiﬁcial strong peaks separated by 24-hour intervals (see Figures 1 and 7 in
Toriumi, Hayashi, and Yokoyama (2014)) making the growth rate measurements
uncertain. Nevertheless, the Toriumi, Hayashi, and Yokoyama (2014) suggestion
is promising, and it should be investigated using improved and more accurate
detection routines.

The magnetic ﬂux emergence process is usually accompanied by interaction
between emerging and pre-existing ﬂuxes. This topic was scrutinized by Fu and
Welsch (2016) who explored the problem in both theoretical and observational
way. As a part of their investigation, they determined the emergence time for
116 ﬂux emergence cases. Authors considered only the total unsigned ﬂux time
variations and did not calculate the ﬂux growth rate. A two-step emergence
behavior, when a gradual emergence stage is followed by rapid emergence, was
detected in 54 cases, whereas 46 cases were consistent with a single-phase (rapid)
emergence process.

In the present study, we focus on the analysis of the time variations of the
ﬂux growth rate. Using SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetograms, we derive this
parameter as a time derivative of the total unsigned ﬂux, which was preliminary
ﬁltered to remove the artiﬁcial 24-hour oscillations (Kutsenko and Abramenko,
2016). Our aim is to reveal how the ﬂux growth rate varies during the rising phase
in various active regions and to make an attempt to infer some information about
the emerging structure basing on the ﬂux growth rate proﬁle.

2. Data Selection and Reduction

For this study, we used line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld data taken by the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al. (2012); Schou et al. (2012)) on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin
(2012)). Continuous 5-7 day long data series for 42 emerging ARs were selected
for the study. We chose only isolated ARs, emerging amidst the quiet Sun. The
list of the ARs, the analyzed time interval, the longitude of emergence, and
calculated emergence parameters are listed in Table 1. We selected only those
ARs that emerged at heliographic longitudes less than 60 degree (except a one
event) to avoid errors that can be introduced by the foreshortening eﬀect. All

but one AR (NOAA AR 11678) ﬁrst appeared in the eastern hemisphere which
allowed us to track the emergence process during an extended period of time.
The 720-second magnetograms were carefully aligned using the IDL Fast Fourier
Transform algorithm to remove the solar rotation eﬀect. The total unsigned
ﬂux was calculated from each magnetogram as a sum of absolute ﬂux values
measured at each pixel. Only those pixels with the modulus of the ﬂux density
twice exceeding the noise level were taken into account. The standard deviation
of noise for HMI magnetograms is about 5-6 G (Liu et al., 2012). The observed
total unsigned ﬂux was then corrected for the foreshortening eﬀect by dividing
it with the cosine of the heliographic longitude (see, Hagenaar (2001)). The
resulting time proﬁles of the total unsigned ﬂux for selected ARs are shown in
Figures 1, 2, and 3 with green curves. We observed an active region until the
moment when the total unsigned ﬂux saturates, i.e., its derivative changes the
sign from positive to negative, see Figures 1, 2, 3. We calculated the maximal
total unsigned ﬂux, F MAX, at the moment when the derivative equals zero.

SDO/HMI magnetic data exhibit artiﬁcial oscillations with period of 24 hours
caused by instrumental eﬀects (Liu et al., 2012; Smirnova et al., 2013; Kutsenko
and Abramenko, 2016). Following the routine suggested by Kutsenko and Abra-
menko (2016), we performed low-frequency ﬁltering to remove these artiﬁcial
oscillations and the resulting proﬁles, F (t), are shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3
with red curves. One can see that artiﬁcial ﬂux oscillations are not negligible.
These projection-corrected and ﬁltered time proﬁles of the total unsigned ﬂux,
F (t), will be used in our study to calculate the ﬂux growth rate. For sake of
simplicity, further in the text we will refer to it as the total ﬂux, F (t).

The ﬂux growth rate was calculated as a time derivative, R(t), of the total
ﬂux, F (t): R(t) = d(F (t))/dt. Since the time derivative does not depend on any
constant component of the ﬂux itself, we ignored the contribution from the quiet
Sun areas within a magnetogram, contrary to a routine suggested in van Driel-
Gesztelyi et al. (2003). Time variations of the ﬂux growth rate are presented in
Figures 1, 2, and 3 with turquoise curves.

Having the time proﬁles of the R(t) function during the emergence, for each
AR we performed a piecewise continuous linear ﬁtting under the following re-
quirements: the ﬁt should consist of four linear pieces; the ﬁrst and third seg-
ments are horizontal, whereas the second and the fourth segments may have an
arbitrary slope. The parameters of the linear pieces are calculated under the
requirement of the minimum mean square deviations from the observed R(t)
curve. The start time was set to the ﬁrst magnetogram acquisition time, and the
end time of the ﬁtting interval in the most of the cases was chosen as the moment
where R(t) = 0. In cases of complex R(t) proﬁles, the end time was modiﬁed
in order to preserve the quality of the ﬁt. The ﬁtting procedure gave us two
characteristic time intervals: ∆t1 - the interval of continuously increasing ﬂux
increment, and ∆t2 - the interval of quasi-constant ﬂux increment (see Table
1, 5th and 6th columns, respectively). The latter is followed by an interval of
decreasing ﬂux increment. We were successful in ﬁtting 36 out of 42 ARs, while
the remaining 6 ARs display a complex R(t) proﬁle (Figure 3), so that the ﬁtting
algorithm failed. We include these ARs in Table 1, however, no ﬁtting parameters
are provided in these cases.

Analysis of the ﬂux growth rate in emerging ARs on the Sun

As it follows from Figures 1 and 2, during the ∆t2-interval, the ﬂux growth
rate, R(t), undulates around the ﬂat ﬁtline reaching its maximum at some mo-
ment. The undulations can be rather low (see, e.g., Figure 2, AR 12266) and
high (e.g., AR 11946 in Figure 2), and the absolute maximum of R(t) does not
seem to adequately describe the AR emergence process. Instead, we accept the
averaged over the ∆t2 value of R(t) as a characteristic of the maximum ﬂux
growth rate of an AR. Their magnitudes, calculated as RMAX =< R(t)| ∆t2>
are listed in the 7th column of Table 1.

As can be seen from Table 1, the RMAX varies within a broad range of values
and, presumably, depends on the saturated (maximal) total unsigned ﬂux, F MAX
(4th column in Table 1), determined at the time when R(t) = 0. To compare
the ﬂux growth rate in strong and weak active regions, we calculated a ﬂux
growth rate of an AR normalized by the maximal total ﬂux of that AR: RN =
RMAX/F MAX. This parameter listed in the 8th column of Table 1 indicates the
fraction of the maximal total ﬂux added to the AR per hour during the ∆t2-stage.

3. Data Analysis

The ∆t2 and RN histograms using data from 36 ARs are shown in Figures 4a
and 4b, respectively. Figure 4a shows a gap at approximately 13 hours, while
in Figure 4b we see a similar separation of the data points into two subsets
with RN<0.024 hour-1 and RN>0.024 hour-1. Are these ∆t2 and RN subsets
independent? To answer the question, we plot ∆t2 versus RN in two ways. In
Figure 5a open circles represent cases with ∆t2<13 hour, whereas in Figure 5b
open circles represent cases with RN>0.024 hour-1. We see that only for 8 cases
the symbol coding has changed to the opposite, while the symbol coding for the
rest 28 cases remains unchanged. This means that for majority of ARs the ∆t2
interval and the normalized ﬂux emergence rate, RN are inversely proportional.
For sake of simplicity further in the text the ARs with short ∆t2 and high RN
will be referred to as ”rapid” emergence events, and, correspondingly, the ARs
with long ∆t2 and low RN will be called ”gradual” emergence events.

There exists a well pronounced statistical dependence between the F MAX
and the ﬂux growth rate, RMAX (Figure 6). When all 36 cases are considered,
a linear regression in the double-logarithmic plot with the slope k=0.69±0.10 is
well deﬁned with Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of 0.75. When the ”rapid” and
”gradual” emergence cases are considered separately, again, the two subsets do
not overlap for both methods of segregation, see panels a and b in Figure 6. More-
over, the linear regressions show diﬀerent slopes. Thus, the ”gradually” emerging
ARs (ﬁlled circles) display a steep slope k=0.89±0.08 for all ∆t2>13 hours events
and k=0.87±0.09 for all the RN<0.024 hour-1 events, and both diﬀer signiﬁcantly
from the k=0.69 slope derived for the entire ensemble. The ”rapidly” emerging
active regions (open circles) in both groups are tightly distributed around the
linear (dashed line) ﬁt (see Figure 6), although the slope varies: k=0.62±0.07
for the ∆t2<13 hours events and k=0.97±0.09 for the RN>0.024 hour-1 events.
Further studies with larger statistics are deﬁnitely needed to clarify the value of
the slope.

Figure 1. Time proﬁles of the total ﬂux before (green curve) and after (red curve) the 24-hour
ﬁltering, the ﬂux growth rate (turquoise curves), and the piecewise continuous linear ﬁt (blue
line segments) to the ﬂux growth rate proﬁles; the three vertical dashed lines mark the start of
the ∆t1 interval, the start of the ∆t2 interval, and the end of the ∆t2 interval. The duration of
∆t1 and ∆t2 in hours are noted in the upper left corner of each plot. The horizontal dashed line
shows the zero-level of the ﬂux growth rate function, R(t). Here we show typical examples of
emerging regions with a short (<13 hours) ∆t2 interval and a high magnitude of the normalized
ﬂux growth rate (RN>0.024 hour-1).

An analysis of time series of magnetograms shows that for the ”rapid” emer-
gence ARs coherent appearance of a bundle of elongated mixed-polarity magnetic
threads over a fast-expanding area is a characteristic feature (see Figure 7 and
movies in the online version). At the very beginning of emergence, it is impossible
to identify where the leading and following parts will be formed. An oval-like
structure forms by the moment of maximal ﬂux growth rate, t* (see bottom
panel in Figure 7). After the peak time, t*, the structure continues to emerge,
however, in a diﬀerent way: the leading and following parts are now well formed

and separated from each other, and the mixed-polarity ﬁlaments/threads (pre-
sumably, ”U” shaped parts of serpentine ﬁeld lines) in the middle of the oval
area become less ordered and either disappear at the location, or drift to the
leading or following magnetic concentrations. The entire picture resembles the
passage of a coherent ﬂux tube through the photosphere in accordance with the
”two-step” emergence model (see Conclusions and Discussion section).

Finally, in Figure 8 we show emergence of an AR where the piecewise ﬁtting
failed because of two well pronounced peaks in the R(t)-proﬁle. The pairs of
numbers (1 and 1), (2 and 2), etc. denote ﬁve consecutively emerging magnetic
dipoles which emerged one after another. These data suggest that in case of
”gradual” emergence, we may deal with a series of ﬂux tubes, emerging along the
same channel in the CZ, and appearing near the same place in the photosphere.

4. Conclusions and Discussion

In this paper, we analyse the ﬂux growth rate for 42 emerging ARs. The ﬂux
growth rate function, R(t), was derived from the total unsigned ﬂux, which was
ﬁltered to remove the artiﬁcial 24-hour oscillations in HMI data. This allowed us
to obtain a more conﬁdent estimate of the R(t) than those reported in previous
studies (e.g., Toriumi, Hayashi, and Yokoyama (2014)).

A continuous piecewise linear ﬁt to the R(t)-proﬁles allowed us to determine
an interval ∆t1 of increasing R(t) and an interval ∆t2 of nearly-constant R(t)
followed by the decrease of R(t). This ﬁtting routine failed to perform well for 6
ARs.

Figure 7. Top - Four consecutive HMI magnetograms of NOAA AR 11678 scaled from 500
G (white) to -500 G (black). The size of the ﬁeld of view is 110 Mm × 55 Mm. North is to
the top, west is to the right. Bottom – Total unsigned ﬂux before (green) and after (red) the
24-hour ﬁltering and the ﬂux growth rate R(t) (turquoise). Vertical dashed lines denote the
magnetogram acquisition times; t* denotes the acquisition time of the third magnetogram near
the maximum of R(t). Animation of the emergence process is available in the supplementary
materials.

During the interval ∆t2, the R(t) function typically exhibited one or several
local maxima. This allowed us to consider the averaged over the ∆t2 growth
rate as an estimate of the maximal value of the ﬂux growth rate, RMAX. The
36 successfully ﬁtted events form two subsets (with an 8 event overlap): i) ARs
with short (<13 hours) ∆t2 interval and a high (>0.024 hour-1) normalized ﬂux
emergence rate, RN which we call ”rapid”-emergence events and ii) ”gradual”-
emergence events characterized by long (>13 hours) ∆t2 interval and a low RN
(<0.024 hour-1).

One more evidence for the separation is oﬀered in the diagrams RMAX versus
F MAX, where the events from diﬀerent subsets are not overlapped and each
subset displays an individual power law. The power law index for the ”rapid”-

Figure 8. The same as in Figure 7 but for NOAA AR 11682. The size of ﬁeld-of-view is 140
Mm × 70 Mm. The pairs of numbers (1 and 1), (2 and 2), etc. denote several consecutively
emerging magnetic dipoles. Notations are the same as in Figure 7. Animation of the emergence
process is available in the supplementary materials.

emergence events varies in a range of 0.62-0.97, and in the range of 0.87-0.89 for
the ”gradual”-emergence events. The power law index as derived for the entire
ensemble of 36 events equals 0.69±0.10.

We found that the maximal ﬂux growth rate RMAX varies in a range of (0.5-
5)×1020 Mx hour-1 for active regions with the maximal total unsigned ﬂux
of (0.5-3)×1022 Mx. Our data points (see Figure 6) can be considered as an
extension (toward larger ﬂuxes and higher rates) of the diagram in Figure 5a in
Otsuji et al. (2011), where the ﬂux growth rate varies in the range of (1018-1020)
Mx hour-1 for regions with the total ﬂux of 1018-0.7×1022 Mx. However, the
α is higher (0.69) in our study as
power index α in the relation RMAX ∝ F MAX
compared to that (0.57) reported in Otsuji et al. (2011). The reason might be
either a diﬀerence in the calculation of the ﬂux growth rate, or a real change of
the index with the total ﬂux.

V.I. Abramenko et al.

For six large active regions studied by Khlystova (2013), the ﬂux growth rate
chaotically varies in a range of (0.4 -1.0)×1020 Mx hour-1 when the total ﬂux
varies in a range of (0.8-2)×1022 Mx. The reported ﬂux growth rate is lower than
our estimates for the same values of the ﬂux, see Figure 6. The reason might
be again the calculation method: in Khlystova (2013), as well as in Otsuji et
al. (2011), the ﬂux growth rate was derived by dividing the saturated ﬂux over
the entire emergence time, whereas in our study, the time derivative R(t) of the
total ﬂux was used to calculate the maximal ﬂux growth rate.

Scrutinized inspection of movies of emergence allows us to detect a typical
diﬀerence between the two emergence types. The ”rapid”-emergence scenario is
consistent with a ”two-step” emergence of a single twisted ﬂux tube (Archontis
et al., 2004; Toriumi and Yokoyama, 2010, 2011) and with magnetic ﬂux ”shred-
ding” described in Cheung et al. (2010); Cheung and Isobe (2014). Frequently,
for these active regions, a rapid expansion of an oval-shaped pattern of mixed
polarity magnetic threads is observed. The leading and following sunspots are
formed later, approximately near the peak of the ﬂux growth rate, t* time in
Figure 7. Before the t*-time, the ﬂattened and horizontally expanded (during the
ﬁrst step of sub-photospheric rising) ﬂux tube blows up into the photosphere; by
the t*-time, the cross-section of the tube already rose above the photosphere, and
later the leading and following footpoints of the tube become more vertical; the
ﬂux growth rate diminishes. It is possible to suggest, at least, two reasons for the
decrease of R(t) at this stage of emergence. First, as the apex of the tube rises,
the contribution to the total ﬂux from the serpentine ﬁeld lines diminishes due
to cancellation, magnetic diﬀusion between opposite polarities, retraction of U-
loops, etc. (Cheung et al., 2008; Centeno, 2012). Second, the azimuth component
Bθ of the magnetic ﬁeld of the tube predominantly contributes to the line-of-sight
ﬂux at the very early stage of emergence, when the tube is nearly horizontal. As
the apex rises and the footpoints become more vertical, Bθ contributes to the
transverse ﬂux (Cheung, Sch¨ussler, and Moreno-Insertis, 2007).

The events of the ”gradual” emergence can then be explained as a consecutive
rising of several ﬂux tubes at the same location, in a full agreement with the
suggestions by Zwaan (1985) and Toriumi, Hayashi, and Yokoyama (2014). Each
tube is then experiencing the ”two-step” emergence process: indeed, bubbles
of mixed polarity serpentine-line features always accompany the consecutive
emergence of dipoles of any size.

A question why the ”rapid”-emergence active regions display the higher nor-
malized ﬂux emergence rate (in other words, they are able to experience the
more intensive emergence) than the ”gradually” emerging active regions, is still
open.

A possible explanation can be oﬀered that the sub-photospheric twisting
motions of the roots of emerging ﬂux tube intensify during the emergence and
thus generate additional azimuthal component of the magnetic ﬁeld. The eﬀect
can be more pronounced in the emergence of a single strong ﬂux tube than
in an ensemble of rather weak ﬂux tubes. In the more general way, the sub-
photospheric turbulent dynamo action (see, e.g., Brandenburg, Sokoloﬀ, and
Subramanian (2012); Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova, and Abramenko (2015)) can manifest
itself in this way, at the emergence stage of magnetic structures.

Analysis of the ﬂux growth rate in emerging ARs on the Sun

Another explanation can be suggested as well. We see that ”rapid”-emergence
ARs usually exhibit emergence of a ﬂattened single bundle, while ”gradual”-
emergence ARs are formed by gradual, extended in time appearance of several
dipoles. This observation can be explained by diﬀerent spatial orientation of
magnetic ﬂux bundle before the start of emergence. A horizontally-oriented
ﬂattened subsurface bundle would produce ”rapid” emergence. Correspondingly,
vertically-oriented nearly-ﬂat bundle would result in consecutive appearance of
the dipoles, one-by-one, as they rise through the photosphere. If this explanation
is correct it raises another question – why diﬀerent ARs are oriented in diﬀerent
way in the upper layer of the photosphere during their pre-emergence stage.

Anyway, a further comparison with simulated data are needed to further
clarify the one of the most intriguing phenomenon on the Sun – the birth of an
active region.
