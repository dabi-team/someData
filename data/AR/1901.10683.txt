HIGHLY-CONNECTED PLANAR CUBIC GRAPHS WITH FEW OR MANY
HAMILTON CYCLES

IRENE PIVOTTO AND GORDON ROYLE

Abstract. In this paper we consider the number of Hamilton cycles in planar cubic graphs
of high cyclic edge-connectivity, answering two questions raised by Chia and Thomassen (“On
the number of longest and almost longest cycles in cubic graphs”, Ars Combin., 104, 307–320,
2012) about extremal graphs in these families. In particular, we ﬁnd families of cyclically 5-
edge connected planar cubic graphs with more Hamilton cycles than the generalized Petersen
graphs P (2n, 2). The graphs themselves are fullerene graphs that correspond to certain carbon
molecules known as nanotubes — more precisely, the family consists of the zigzag nanotubes of
(ﬁxed) width 5 and increasing length. In order to count the Hamilton cycles in the nanotubes,
we develop methods inspired by the transfer matrices of statistical physics. We outline how
these methods can be adapted to count the Hamilton cycles in nanotubes of greater (but still
ﬁxed) width, with the caveat that the resulting expressions involve matrix powers. We also
consider cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic planar graphs with few Hamilton cycles, and exhibit
an inﬁnite family of such graphs each with exactly 4 Hamilton cycles. Finally we consider the
“other extreme” for these two classes of graphs, thus investigating cyclically 4-edge connected
cubic planar graphs with many Hamilton cycles and the cyclically 5-edge connected cubic planar
graphs with few Hamilton cycles. In each of these cases, we present partial results, examples
and conjectures regarding the graphs with few or many Hamilton cycles.

1. Introduction

The study of Hamilton cycles in cubic graphs has an extensive history, initially driven by at-
tempts to prove Tait’s conjecture that every 3-connected planar cubic graph is Hamiltonian. If
the conjecture were true, the Four-Colour Theorem would have been an immediate corollary,
but this possible avenue to a proof was ﬁrmly closed nearly 60 years later by Tutte’s [7] discovery
of a non-Hamiltonian 3-connected planar cubic graph. In this same paper, Tutte also presented
an ingenious parity argument that a cubic graph cannot have a unique Hamilton cycle, crediting
the result (but not this particular proof) to his friend and colleague C.A.B Smith. (Unfortu-
nately, Smith’s original proof appears to have been lost.) As a consequence, a Hamiltonian cubic
graph has at least three Hamilton cycles, and while the planar cubic graphs with exactly three
Hamilton cycles are known (Fowler [3]), a full classiﬁcation is not.

Many authors have considered the existence of Hamilton cycles for restricted classes of cubic
graphs deﬁned by imposing additional conditions such as planarity, bipartiteness, high connec-
tivity and/or combinations of such conditions, often leading to diﬃcult still-unsolved problems.
The most prominent of these is probably Barnette’s conjecture that a three-connected cubic
planar bipartite graph is Hamiltonian. There is a smaller literature concerning the enumeration
of Hamilton cycles, though there are some notable results such as Schwenk’s [5] enumeration of
the Hamilton cycles in the generalized Petersen graphs P (m, 2) (which are deﬁned below). It
is clear that exact enumeration results will only ever be possible for explicitly-deﬁned graphs
or families of graphs, and only then if the graphs are highly structured. Where exact results
are impossible, researchers usually try to determine bounds on the values under consideration.
Along these lines, Chia and Thomassen [2] considered a number of classes of cubic graphs deﬁned
according to various connectivity and planarity constraints and investigated upper- and lower-
bounds (as functions of the number of vertices) for the number of Hamilton cycles of a graph

in each class. In fact, they actually considered the slightly broader question of bounding the
numbers of longest cycles, in order to include possibly-non-Hamiltonian graphs in their results.
However in this paper, we restrict our attention to Hamiltonian graphs only giving us the main
question—If a graph in a particular class has at least one Hamilton cycle, then how many more
must it have and how many more can it have.

Accompanying their results and examples, Chia and Thomassen posed ﬁve open problems re-
garding the number of Hamilton cycles in diﬀerent classes of cubic graphs. In this paper, we
answer two of their questions (which happen to be their Question 1 and Question 5), each of
which relates to a class of planar cubic graphs of a particular minimum cyclic edge-connectivity.

Q1 Does every planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graph on n vertices contain at least

n/2 longest cycles?

Q5 Does there exist a planar cubic cyclically 5-edge-connected graph on 4n vertices with

more longest cycles than P (2n, 2)?

We recall here that a graph is cyclically k-edge-connected if there is no edge-set with fewer than
k edges whose deletion leaves at least two connected components each containing a cycle. The
constraint that each connected component contain a cycle is designed to rule out trivial edge
cuts, such as the edges incident with a single vertex or the four edges incident with exactly one
of the endpoints of a ﬁxed edge. So while a cubic graph is at most 3-edge-connected under the
normal deﬁnition, its cyclic edge-connectivity can be arbitrarily large. One family of graphs
that crops up frequently in any discussion of Hamilton cycles in cubic graphs is the family of
u0, u1, . . . , um−1} ∪
generalized Petersen graphs, deﬁned as follows: P (m, k) has 2m vertices
{
where for each i, vertex ui is adjacent to ui+1, vertex vi is adjacent to vi+k,
v0, v1, . . . , vm−1}
{
and ui is adjacent to vi, with all indices being taken modulo m. Generalized Petersen graphs
crop up frequently in the study of cubic graphs, for example P (5, 2) is the Petersen graph and
P (10, 2) is the dodecahedron.

The main results of this paper are that the answers to these two questions are “No” and “Yes”
respectively. In Section 2 we answer Problem 1 by showing that there is an inﬁnite family of
planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs with a constant number of Hamilton cycles,
independent of the number of vertices in the graph. We note that this result was recently
independently obtained by Goedgebeur, Meersman and Zamﬁrescu [4], along with a number
of additional attractive results regarding not-necessarily-cubic Hamiltonian graphs with few
Hamilton cycles.

In Section 5 we answer Problem 5 by showing that a certain family of fullerene graphs (pla-
nar cubic graphs with faces of size 5 and 6 only) known to mathematical chemists as “capped
(5, 0) zigzag nanotubes” has more Hamilton cycles than the generalized Petersen graph P (2n, 2)
whenever the number of vertices is a multiple of 20 greater than 20.

∈ {

In order to count the numbers of Hamilton cycles in the nanotubes and related graphs, we use
methods inspired by the transfer matrix methods of statistical physics. In addition to counting
the number of Hamilton cycles in our particular class of nanotubes, we give a general procedure
that could – in principle – be carried out for nanotubes of any ﬁxed moderate width. For
n
, the graphs P (2n, 2) are themselves fullerenes, but as they have two faces of length n,
5, 6
}
they look less and less fullerene-like as n increases. It is therefore somewhat surprising that the
graphs with more Hamilton cycles than P (2n, 2) are themselves fullerenes. However it turns out
that nanotubes are not the only fullerenes that have more Hamilton cycles than the generalized
Petersen graphs, as our computations revealed an additional example on 56 vertices. We suspect
that this graph lies in another inﬁnite family of fullerenes particularly rich in Hamilton cycles,
but we have not yet been able to describe this family in general.

Computationally, it is relatively straightforward to construct planar cubic cyclically k-edge-
connected graphs using Brinkmann & McKay’s program plantri [1] and then count their

Table 1. Hamilton cycles in planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs

Hamilton cycles. (The numbers of such graphs can be found in Sloane’s Encyclopaedia of Inte-
ger Sequences ([6]) at http://oeis.org/A007021 for k = 4 and http://oeis.org/A006791 for
k = 5.) We performed these computations for all the graphs on up to 42 vertices for k = 4, and
up to 64 vertices for k = 5. The results of these computations are given in Table 1 and Table 2.
Note that while the total numbers of graphs includes graphs that are non-Hamiltonian, the col-
umn “Min” lists the minimum number of Hamilton cycles in a Hamiltonian graph in that family.
(We note that Goedgebeur, Meersman and Zamﬁrescu [4] have more extensive computations for
this class of graphs in their investigation of graphs with few Hamilton cycles.)

Given that we have already computed the necessary data, we also consider the “other extreme”
for each of these two classes of planar cubic graphs. In other words, we consider the cyclically
4-edge connected planar cubic graphs with the most Hamilton cycles in Section 3, and the
cyclically 5-edge connected planar cubic graphs with the fewest Hamilton cycles in Section 4.

2. Planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs with few Hamilton cycles

The ﬁrst class of graphs that we consider is the class of planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected
graphs, focussing ﬁrst on those with few Hamilton cycles thereby addressing the ﬁrst question
from Chia and Thomassen: “Does every planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graph on n ver-
tices have at least n/2 longest cycles?”. We note that this question is essentially asking whether
there is a lower bound on the number of Hamilton cycles that is linear in the number of vertices.
Table 1 shows that this is not true for most of the values of n within our computational range,
and in this section we show that this continues indeﬁnitely by constructing an inﬁnite family
of planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs, each with a constant number of Hamilton
cycles. More precisely, we exhibit a 38-vertex planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graph
with exactly four Hamilton cycles that acts as a “starter” graph. We then show that this graph
contains special conﬁgurations that can be extended by the addition of any multiple of 4 vertices
in such a way that each graph constructed is cubic, planar, cyclically 4-edge-connected, and has
the same number of Hamilton cycles as the starter graph.

Table 2. Hamilton cycles in planar cubic cyclically 5-edge-connected graphs

As noted previously, this has been independently proved by Goedgebeur, Meersman and Zam-
ﬁrescu [4].

The construction adding four vertices proceeds as follows: Let C be an induced 4-cycle in a
graph G, with edges v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, and v4v1. Construct a graph H from G by replacing
the edge v1v2 with a path v1x1x2v2 and replacing the edge v3v4 with a path v3y2y1v4, where
x1, x2, y1, y2 are new vertices. Finally, add edges x1y1 and x2y2. Then we say that H is obtained
from G by a ladder extension on edges v1v2 and v3v4; we are extending a “2-rung ladder” to
a 4-rung ladder. The next lemma shows that — under certain circumstances — performing a
ladder extension does not alter the number of Hamilton cycles in the graph.

Lemma 2.1. Suppose that C is an induced 4-cycle in a graph G with vertices
v1, v2, v3, v4}
{
(as in Figure 1), that all the vertices of C have degree 3 in G, and that G
is not
v1v2, v3v4}
Hamiltonian. Furthermore, let H be the graph obtained from G by a ladder extension on v1v2
and v3v4. Then there is a bijection between the Hamilton cycles of G and the Hamilton cycles
of H.

\ {

Proof. We start by considering a Hamilton cycle D of G. Then either D uses both v1v2 and v3v4
or, without loss of generality, E(D)
. In the ﬁrst case, replacing the
v4v1, v1v2, v2v3}
{
edge v1v2 with the path v1x1x2v2 and the edge v3v4 with the path v3y2y1v4 yields a Hamilton
cycle of H. Moreover, all Hamilton cycles of H using these two paths arise from Hamilton cycles
of G in this way. In the second case, replacing the edge v1v2 with the path v1x1y1y2x2v2 yields
a Hamilton cycle of H. Moreover, all Hamilton cycles of H using this path arise from Hamilton
cycles of G in this way.

Up to symmetry, any further Hamilton cycle in H would necessarily use the paths v1x1y1v4 and
v2x2y2v3 or use the path v1x1x2y2y1v4 and edge v2v3. In either of these two cases, this Hamilton
cycle would correspond to a Hamilton cycle of G using only the edges v1v4 and v2v3 of C, a
(cid:3)

contradiction to the condition that G

is not Hamiltonian.

\ {

We call a 4-cycle extendable if it meets the hypotheses of the lemma, and note that after
performing a ladder extension, the newly-created 4-cycles in H[v1, v2, v3, v4, x1, x2, y1, y2] are
also extendable. Therefore the process can be repeated, extending a 4-cycle to an arbitrarily
long ladder (provided the total number of rungs is even), thus creating an inﬁnite family of
graphs with the same number of Hamilton cycles as the original graph.

Theorem 2.2. For all n > 38 such that n

2 (mod 4), there is a planar cubic cyclically

Proof. It can be veriﬁed, most easily by computer, that the graph of Figure 3 has exactly four
Hamilton cycles. In fact, as illustrated in the second ﬁgure, 30 edges lie in all four Hamilton cycles
and 11 lie in no Hamilton cycles, leaving just 8 out of the remaining 16 edges to (potentially)
complete a Hamilton cycle. These “undecided” edges (drawn dashed in the ﬁgure) fall into two
8-cycles, and it is easy to see that a Hamilton cycle must use exactly four pairwise disjoint edges
(i.e. a perfect matching) from each of these 8-cycles. As each cycle has exactly two perfect
matchings, there are only four choices for the additional 8 edges, and all four of the possible
choices yield a Hamilton cycle.

The graph has two 4-cycles and as every Hamilton cycle uses the two (roughly) vertical edges in
each of those, both of the 4-cycles are extendable, and so can be extended to ladders of arbitrary
(cid:3)
even length.

As the graph of Figure 3 has two extendable 4-cycles and each can independently be extended
to a ladder with an arbitrary (even) number of rungs, this gives to a slowly increasing number
of examples as the number of vertices increases. We expect that there will be another graph on
n

0 (mod 4) vertices with exactly four Hamilton cycles and extendable cycles.

3. Planar cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs with many Hamilton cycles

In this section, we consider planar cubic cyclically 4-edge connected graphs with many Hamilton
cycles. The computational evidence reveals deﬁnite patterns in the extremal graphs in this
class, although probably too complicated for an exact characterisation. We content ourselves
with identifying a family of graphs with many Hamilton cycles that we believe to be extremal
inﬁnitely often, when n satisﬁes certain parity conditions.

A k-rung ladder (or just k-ladder for short) is the Cartesian product Pk (cid:3) K2 of a k-vertex
path Pk with K2, which we will assume is labelled as in Fig. 4. Borrowing terminology from the
physical ladders found in hardware stores, the two copies of Pk are called the rails of the ladder
(so each ladder has a u-rail and a v-rail) and the rungs are the edges connecting the rails.

For m, k > 2, we deﬁne an m-ring of k-ladders, denoted RL(m, k), to be the graph obtained by
connecting m disjoint k-ladders L0, L1, . . ., Lm−1 in a cycle. Adjacent ladders in the circular
order are joined by adding edges connecting the vertices u1 and uk in Li to the vertices v1 and
vk (respectively) in Li+1. (This construction is most easily understood by glancing at Figure 4.)
The graph RL(m, k) is a planar cubic cyclically 4-edge connected graph on 2mk vertices.

edges E(Li−1, Li)
E(Li, Li+1) form an edge-cut of the graph and so any Hamilton cycle C uses
an even non-zero number of these edges, therefore either 2 or 4. Parity considerations show that
there are three distinct cases to consider, according to the number of edges that a Hamilton
cycle C uses from each pair E(Li, Li+1).

If the number of vertices is a multiple of 8, say 8s, then an s-ring of 4-ladders has 2 + (4s)3s−2
Hamilton cycles, which we conjecture to be the maximum for suﬃciently large v.
In fact at
v = 40 the graph RL(5, 4) with 542 Hamilton cycles is the unique extremal graph, and we
expect this to continue for v > 48. However for 16, 24 and 32 vertices there are seemingly
sporadic graphs with more Hamilton cycles than the ring of 4-ladders.

4. Planar cubic cyclically 5-edge-connected graphs with few Hamilton Cycles

After the expected initial variability, the data from Table 2 shows that the minimum number
of Hamilton cycles appears to settle down as the number of vertices increases. It is therefore
tempting and plausible to conjecture that this is the minimum and that every Hamiltonian graph
in this class has at least 16 cycles.

In total, there are 18 planar cubic cyclically 5-edge-connected graphs on 52–64 vertices with
exactly 16 Hamilton cycles. (There are 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2 and 6 graphs on 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62 and
64 vertices respectively). However while they all look qualitatively “similar” to each other, it is
diﬃcult to discern any structural patterns with suﬃcient precision to be generalized.

Having nothing more to add, we therefore conclude this section by presenting two graphs from
this collection in Fig. 6 in the hope that some reader of this paper can detect a pattern that has
eluded us.

5. Planar cubic cyclically 5-edge-connected graphs with many Hamilton Cycles

Problem 5 from Chia and Thomassen [2] asks if the generalized Petersen graphs P (2n, 2) on
4n vertices have the greatest number of Hamilton cycles amongst all planar cubic cyclically

In fact, in the text of their paper
5-edge-connected graphs on the same number of vertices.
they speculate on something rather stronger, namely that “For cubic cyclically 5-edge-connected
graphs, the generalized Petersen graphs are possible candidates for those that have the maximum
number of longest cycles”, whereas in Problem 5 the same question is raised only with respect
to planar graphs.

For m > 9, the generalized Petersen graph P (m, 2) on 2m vertices is a cyclically 5-edge-connected
cubic graph. It is planar if and only if m is even, and in this case the number of Hamilton cycles
of P (m, 2) is given by

of 4, but with a number of curious exceptions on v = 40, v = 56 and v = 60 vertices. In the
remainder of this section we describe an inﬁnite family of graphs, one for each multiple of 20
vertices, that includes the exceptional graphs on 40 and 60 vertices. On 20 vertices, this graph
coincides with P (10, 2), but for all larger multiples of 20, this graph has strictly more Hamilton
cycles than the generalized Petersen graph P (2n, 2) on the same number of vertices.

We deﬁne a graph, which we denote N (5, k) (for reasons to be explained below) in the following
fashion: arrange in a concentric manner k +2 disjoint cycles, where the innermost and outermost
cycles are copies of C5 and the remaining k cycles are copies of C10, as illustrated in the left-
hand graph of Figure 7. Then connect each consecutive pair of cycles with a 5-vertex matching
in such a way that the vertices on each of the inner 10-cycles are connected alternately to the
neighbouring cycle on the inside, and the neighbouring cycle on the outside, while respecting
the cyclic order of the vertices on all the cycles. (A glance at the second illustration of Figure 7
will clarify this rather cumbersome deﬁnition!) The graph N (5, 1) has two 5-cycles separated
by a single 10-cycle and is easily recognised as the dodecahedron, while N (5, 3) and N (5, 5) are
the graphs with the greatest number of Hamilton cycles on 40 and 60 vertices respectively.

Statistical physicists and others interested in the chromatic roots of graphs may recognise this
5P strip of the triangular lattice with a vertex of degree 5
graph as the planar dual of an nF ×
as the end-graph at each end. In fact, we will count the Hamilton cycles of N (5, k) in a manner
highly reminiscent of the “transfer matrix” techniques used in those ﬁelds. On the other hand,
mathematical chemists may recognise this graph as a fullerene graph, which is a cubic planar
graph all of whose faces have size 5 or 6. This name arose because certain carbon allotropes
named fullerenes have a carbon skeleton (i.e., the conﬁguration of carbon atoms joined by bonds)
that is a fullerene graph. The family
corresponds to a family of molecules
N (5, k)
{
called nanotubes, because their physical realization is a long thin cylindrical structure. So the
notation N (5, k) is a mnemonic for “nanotube of width 5 and length k”. (There is more precise
chemical nomenclature as there are a number of diﬀerent types of nanotube, but we do not need
this for our current purpose.)

Although these circular pictures highlight the symmetry and planarity of the graphs N (5, k),
in order to analyse their Hamilton cycles we will draw them in a way that exhibits the 5-edge
cuts separating consecutive layers. Figure 8 shows the graph N (5, 3) with the two 5-cycles at
the left- and right-hand end of the picture, and with three “10-vertex layers” between them.
Our counting argument is based on examining which conﬁgurations of edges inside a layer can
be part of a Hamilton cycle, and in how many ways these conﬁgurations can be combined
across layers. Figure 9 shows a representation of an arbitrary layer, consisting of ﬁve edges

the number of edges used by a Hamilton cycle is the same on each side of the layer. So there
are two types of Hamilton cycle — those using 2 edges between each consecutive pair of layers,
and those using 4 edges between each consecutive pair of layers. We call these Type 2 and Type
4 respectively.

It turns out that N (5, k) always has Type 2 Hamilton cycles, but it only has Type 4 Hamilton
cycles when k is odd, and so it is only when the number of vertices is a multiple of 20 that
N (5, k) has many Hamilton cycles.

Theorem 5.1. For odd k, the graph N (5, k) on n = 10 + 10k vertices has

Hamilton cycles, while for even k it has 5

2k Hamilton cycles.

Proof. For brevity, let N denote the graph N (5, k) and assume that it is laid out as in Figure 8
with L0 denoting the left-hand 5-cycle (here we are using L for “layer”), L1, L2, . . ., Lk denoting
the 10-cycles in order from left-to-right, and Lk+1 denoting the right-hand 5-cycle. We call L0
the starting layer, Li for i 6 i 6 k the internal layers and Lk+1 the ﬁnishing layer. Given
a Hamilton cycle H, let H(i) denote the restriction of H to Li, and let H(0, i) denote the
Li. We say that H(0, i) is a partial Hamilton
restriction of H to the vertices L0 ∪
cycle with i + 1 layers. Our overall strategy will be to count how many ways there are to extend
a partial Hamilton cycle with i + 1 layers to a partial Hamilton cycle with i + 2 layers. As H
is a Hamilton cycle, H(0, i) is a disjoint union of paths that collectively touch every vertex in
Li, and whose vertices of degree 1, which we call terminals, are all on the right-hand
L0∪
side of Li. Illustrating this, Fig. 12 shows a partial Hamilton cycle H(0, 2) in N (5, 3) consisting
of two paths, and which has terminals
. The ﬁfth vertex w4 is not a terminal
w0, w1, w2, w3}
{
because it already has degree 2 in the partial Hamilton cycle. Each path in the partial Hamilton
cycle has two endvertices, and so the terminals of H(0, i) are grouped into pairs. Therefore the
into pairs, and singletons (the
partial Hamilton cycle determines a partition of
vertices of degree 2), which we will call the terminal partition of H(0, i). As an example, the
partial Hamilton cycle of Fig. 12 has terminal partition

The key observation behind our counting technique is that it is the terminal partition alone that
determines in how many ways a partial Hamilton cycle can be extended by another layer and,
in addition, the terminal partitions of the resulting extended partial Hamilton cycles. Thus our
strategy will be to work layer-by-layer, keeping track at each stage not only of the total number of
partial Hamilton cycles, but also the auxiliary information of how many partial Hamilton cycles
have each type of terminal partition. By the observation above, this additional information is
suﬃcient to calculate both the number of partial Hamilton cycles and the additional information
for the partial Hamilton cycles with an additional layer.

The restriction H(i) of a Hamilton cycle H to any individual internal layer Li has the following
structure: it is a spanning subgraph of Li where every vertex has degree 1 or 2, and which has an
even number of terminals in
and (as a consequence) the same even number of ter-
. Similarly, H(0) and H(k +1) are spanning subgraphs of L0 and Lk+1
w0, w1, . . . , w4}
minals in
{
respectively, with every vertex having degree 1 or 2, and again having an even number of vertices
of degree 1 that we call terminals. It is clear that the sequence (H(0), H(1), H(2), . . . , H(k + 1))
determines the entire Hamilton cycle because every terminal vertex is incident with a unique
edge connecting consecutive layers.

v0, v1, . . . , v4}
{

We will call a spanning subgraph of C10 (labelled as in Fig. 9) that meets these conditions
an internal tile and a spanning subgraph of C5 meeting these conditions an end tile. So each

HIGHLY-CONNECTED PLANAR CUBIC GRAPHS WITH FEW OR MANY HAMILTON CYCLES

11

Hamilton cycle can be identiﬁed with a sequence of tiles, starting and ending with an end-
tile, and otherwise consisting of internal tiles. In order that a sequence of tiles correspond to
a Hamilton cycle it is necessary that the terminals on one tile match up to the terminals on
adjacent tiles, and also that the resulting 2-regular graph has just one component. We say that a
tile T is consistent with a partial Hamilton cycle H(0, i) provided that adding T to the sequence
of tiles yields a valid partial Hamilton cycle.

Now we are ready to count the Type 2 Hamilton cycles. A routine case analysis shows that
every end tile is equivalent to the one shown in Figure 13 and every internal tile is equivalent
to one of the two shown in Figure 13. Thus up to symmetry we may assume that H(0) is the
tile pictured in Figure 13. The only valid choices for the next tile are those that have
as
left-hand terminals, so there are two choices for H(1) (also shown in Figure 13). Now although
the exact choices for H(2) depend on which of the two choices for H(1) was used, the number
of possibilities does not. All of the tiles have two consecutive (in the cyclic order) vertices for
left-hand terminals and two consecutive vertices for their right-hand terminals, and so there are
always exactly two tiles consistent with any partial Hamilton cycle. So in total, there are 5
choices for the 5-tile H(0), then 2 choices for each of H(1), H(2), . . ., H(k) and ﬁnally there is
a unique choice of ﬁnal tile to complete the Hamilton cycle. Therefore for all k there are exactly
5

2k Hamilton cycles of Type 2.

For the Hamilton cycles of Type 2, there was only one requirement when extending the tuple of
tiles, namely that the right- and left-hand terminals of consecutive tiles must line up. Therefore
the choices for each tile depended purely on the (right-hand) terminals of the previous one.
However the analysis for Type 4 is slightly more subtle, because whether a tile is consistent
or otherwise depends not just on the set of all terminals, but also on the terminal partition of
H(0, i). If the new edges create a path in H(0, i + 1) joining two terminals of H(0, i) in the same
cell, then H(0, i + 1) will contain a short cycle, so never lead to a Hamilton cycle. If the new tile
is consistent with H(0, i), then by adding it we obtain a partial Hamilton cycle H(0, i + 1) and
this newly extended partial Hamilton cycle will have its own terminal partition. For example,
Fig. 14 shows a possible partial Hamilton cycle H(0, 1) with terminal partition
and

a possible extension H(0, 2) which has terminal partition

Finally we must consider how a partial Hamilton cycle H(0, k) can be completed to a Hamilton
cycle, by adding the ﬁnal tile H(k + 1). Again, a simple case analysis on the ﬁve-cycle shows
that this is only possible if the terminal partition of H(0, k) lies in
O1, and in this case there is a
unique way to complete the partial Hamilton cycle. In particular if k is even, then the terminal
O2 and so it cannot be completed, meaning that these graphs have

no Type 4 Hamilton cycles. If k is odd however, then there are 5 choices for H(0), 4 choices for

Adding the contributions from each type of Hamilton cycle yields the stated result.

(cid:3)

The nanotubes N (5, k) have many Hamilton cycles only when k is odd, so the number of vertices
is a multiple of 20, say v = 20t. Then we are comparing the generalized Petersen graph P (10t, 2)
and the nanotube N (5, 2t
1). Evaluating the two expressions for the numbers of Hamilton
cycles in each graph and extracting the leading term gives the following values:

where ϕ = (1 + √5)/2 is the Golden Ratio.
As ϕ5

cles than the equal-sized generalized Petersen graph, thereby answering Chia and Thomassen’s
question in the aﬃrmative. Checking the exact values for small t conﬁrms that when t = 2, the
nanotube on 40 vertices already has strictly more Hamilton cycles than P (20, 2) and this holds
for all larger values of t.

6. Wider nanotubes

It is easy to see how the deﬁnition of the nanotubes N (5, k) can be generalized to the family
N (w, k) for any ﬁxed w > 5 (here w stands for “width”) — replace the 5-cycles with w-cycles
and the 10-cycles with 2w-cycles, and connect them using the same alternating in-out pattern
as for the family N (5, k). Although these graphs are not even fullerenes for w > 6 we will still
call them nanotubes. In this section we will outline how the method above can be generalized to
enumerate Hamilton cycles in the family N (w, k) for any moderate ﬁxed with k. The resulting
expression involves a matrix product, and while the exact value for the number of Hamilton
cycles can easily be evaluated for speciﬁc values of k, there may be no exact formula.
In
this latter case however, it can be possible to extract the asymptotic rate of growth using the
eigenstructure of the transfer matrix.

As before, any Hamilton cycle in the graph N (w, k) will use a ﬁxed even number of the edges
between consecutive layers, and we separately count the number of Hamilton cycles of Type 2,
Type 4 and so on. Suppose then that we are trying to count the number of Hamilton cycles of
Type 2c for some c such that 2c 6 w.

Let
P
and w

denote the set of non-crossing partitions of

2c singletons, and suppose that

Oi and let the ij-entry of M be the number of tiles that transfers π to a terminal partition
Oj. By the symmetry of the situation, Mij is independent of the actual choice of π.
In Section 5 we implicitly calculated the entries of the transfer matrix, but due to their partic-
ularly simple form, we did not need to explicitly put them into matrix form. Had we done so,
we would have obtained the very simple transfer matrix

Oi can be transferred to a terminal partition in
Hamilton cycles H(0, r + 1) with terminal partition in

Oj, as required.

of partial Hamilton cycles with terminal partition in

which such a partial Hamilton cycle can be completed to a Hamilton cycle.

For any particular choice of w and c, the computation of the transfer matrix and the start-
and ﬁnish-vectors can be totally automated, yielding a formula involving a matrix power. For a
computer algebra system, ﬁnding a speciﬁc power of an integer matrix is relatively easy, even if
both the matrix and the power are quite large. However a list of explicit values for the numbers
of Hamilton cycles in a selection of nanotubes of varying lengths (but always ﬁxed width w)
does not immediately reveal the asymptotic behaviour of these numbers. In these cases, it is
necessary to examine the eigenstructure of transfer matrix in order to extract information about
the asymptotic growth of the number of Hamilton cycles as the length of the nanotube increases.

We conclude by asking whether the nanotubes of width 6 beat the nanotubes of width 5, which
we can analyse just by comparing rate of growth for each family expressed as a function of the
number of vertices. (Notice that we are also ignoring the Hamilton cycles of Type 2 and Type
6 in the width 6 case, but as these are dominated by the number of Type 4, we are justiﬁed in
doing so.) Therefore this is a comparison between 12v/20 for the N (5, k) family and and Bv/12
for the N (6, k) family. However

and so the nanotubes of width 6 will (eventually) beat the nanotubes of width 5. The smallest
number of vertices for which there exists a graph in each of the families is when v = 60, but
N (5, 5) with 3040 Hamilton cycles has dramatically more than N (6, 4) with 1232 Hamilton
cycles (of which 1104 are Type 4).

8. Conclusion

While there is a vast literature on the existence of Hamilton cycles in graphs, especially cubic
graphs, and even more especially planar cubic graphs, there is much less on the enumeration of
Hamilton cycles.

One of the ﬁrst results in this area was Schwenk’s [5] enumeration of the number of Hamilton
cycles in the generalized Petersen graphs P (m, 2). His very ﬁrst open question, now 30 years
old – whether it is possible to determine the number of Hamilton cycles in P (m, k) for k > 3 –
has still not been answered.

It seems that Chia & Thomassen [2] were the ﬁrst to explicitly consider counting the rate of
growth of the maximum number of Hamilton cycles in various classes of cubic graphs. For a range
of classes of cubic graphs, deﬁned primarily by connectivity constraints they found promising
families of graphs rich in Hamilton cycles, and then asked whether these were actually the best
possible. Given that this was likely to be done without computer assistance, it is a testament
to their ingenuity that it seems diﬃcult to ﬁnd families of graphs richer in Hamilton cycles. In
particular, they found a family of 2-connected cubic graphs with
Hamilton cycles and
4√2
a family of 3-connected graphs with (3/√2)
Hamilton cycles. Either a proof that these
(cid:1)
families are indeed extremal or an example with more Hamilton cycles would be very interesting.

Finally, we turn to the single graph on 56 vertices that somehow beats the generalized Petersen
graph P (28, 2), which is pictured in Fig. 19. A rapid examination of the faces illustrated in the
ﬁgure reveal that all have size 5 or 6 and so the graph is again a fullerene. The graph has an
automorphism group of order 6, but it is not cyclic so we cannot obtain a drawing with 6-fold
rotational symmetry. It would be interesting to see if this graph belongs to another family of
fullerenes with more Hamilton cycles than the generalized Petersen graphs.
