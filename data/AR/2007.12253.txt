X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) is used to investigate the ﬂuctuation dynamics dur-
ing self-organized nanopatterning of silicon by Ar+ bombardment at 65◦ polar angle. Rich structure
is observed in the development of the correlation dynamics as seen in the evolving correlation time
τ (q||) and ﬂuctuation relaxation exponent n(q||). On length scales of the ripple structure, local
structure becomes ever more long-lived as coarsening progresses. In addition, τ (q||) develops a peak
on length scales corresponding to the ripple wavelength. As patterning progresses, correlation times
become asymmetric between the positive and negative directions, suggesting the possibility of dif-
ferent dynamics on the slopes facing toward and away from the ion beam. Relaxation exponents
show evolution from linear dynamics at early times to compressed exponential relaxation at low
wavenumbers and stretched exponential relaxation at high wavenumbers. Compressed exponential
behavior is reminiscent of stress relaxation processes observed in glasses.

INTRODUCTION

Broad beam low-energy ion bombardment of surfaces
can lead to the self-organized formation of patterns in-
cluding nanodots [1], nanoscale ripples [2] and nanoscale
pits/holes [3], as well as to ultrasmoothening [4]. The dif-
ferences in morphology can be achieved by varying irra-
diation conditions such as ion energy, ﬂuence, bombard-
ment angle, ion species and substrate [5].
In the case
of elemental semiconductors patterned at room temper-
ature the surface is amorphized by the ions and oﬀ-axis
bombardment can produce ripple patterns. Competing
theories of self-organized ion beam nanopatterning advo-
cate for or combine models of diﬀerent physical processes
believed to play important roles,
including curvature-
dependent sputtering [6–8], lateral mass redistribution
[9], surface diﬀusion [8], ion-enhanced viscous ﬂow [10]
and stress-induced ﬂow [11–15]. Despite much experi-
mental study, agreement on which eﬀects dominate in a
given situation has not been reached. Theory and exper-

iment are often compared using the average kinetics, i.e.
the evolution of the nanoscale surface structure spatially
averaged over the area sampled by the experiment. Pa-
rameters entering theories are often poorly known a pri-
ori and can therefore be varied to ﬁt the average kinetics
observed in a given study, allowing competing theories to
claim agreement with experiment.

Going beyond the average kinetics to examine the de-
tailed ﬂuctuation dynamics of the nanopatterning pro-
cess oﬀers a new route to test theory and gain better
understanding. By dynamics we mean the temporal evo-
lution of ﬂuctuations about the average nanoscale struc-
ture. The dynamics of such surface evolution is becom-
ing accessible through developments in the coherent x-ray
scattering technique of X-ray Photon Correlation Spec-
troscopy (XPCS) [16]. Continued increases in coherent
x-ray ﬂux at synchrotron and free-electron laser sources is
enabling the application of XPCS to surface growth and
patterning, but such studies remain few in number and
the technique’s full potential is not yet clear. Thus, an
important part of the current work is also the continued
exploration and development of the technique’s capabil-
ities for such investigations. XPCS studies of ion beam
nanopatterning have previously been performed for Ar+

patterning of GaSb [17] and of SiO2 [18]. In both cases,
however, the dominant length scale in the system - that
of the ripples formed on the surface - coarsens beyond the
length scales that could be observed in the experiment.
In the present study (Part I) and its companion paper
(Part II [19]) we examine the classic cases of Si surface
nanopatterning by Ar+ and Kr+ respectively. We are
able to examine dynamics on the length scales of the
self-organized ripples, and to compare those results with
predictions of theory.

In the nonlinear regime, theories of surface evolution
cannot be solved analytically and simulation must be
used to determine their predictions. Moreover, obtaining
suﬃcient statistics for analysis of the dynamics requires
more lattice realizations than for analyzing average ki-
netics. Therefore, within the scope of the present pa-
per we could compare results with predictions of a single
theory - a recent minimal model by Harrison, Pearson
and Bradley (HPB) which incorporates a cubic nonlin-
earity [20, 21]. It’s known that the full inclusion of lower
order terms to the widely-used anisotropic Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky (aKS) equation [22] can also give several ki-
netics behaviors similar to those observed below, includ-
ing interrupted coarsening, broken parity, and develop-
ment of ripples with preferential asymmetric slopes [23].
Therefore, our focus on simulations of the minimal HPB
model does not imply the inability of other models to
produce similar results.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In Sect. II below
we describe the methods used in the experiments and
simulations. Section III provides a broad brush overview
of the basic behavior observed in the speckle-averaged
x-ray intensity evolution during nano-ripple formation.
The early stages of the patterning process are analyzed in
Sect. IV to determine the linear theory coeﬃcients which
can themselves be compared with theoretical predictions
and which inform the parameters used in the subsequent
simulations. Section V examines the late-stage coarsen-
ing kinetics in both experiment and simulation while the
evolution of ﬂuctuation dynamics is examined in Sect.
VI. The results and their implications are discussed in
Sect. VII.

II. METHODS

A. Samples and Ion Bombardment

FIG. 1.
Schematic diagram of the GISAXS experiment.
The ion source is placed at the polar angle θ, which causes
self-organized rippling on the silicon surface. The sample is
positioned so that the X-ray incident angle αi is slightly above
the critical angle of total external reﬂection. The scattering
is recorded as a function of the exit angles αf and ψ using a
2D detector.

sample holder was mounted in a custom UHV chamber
with mica X-ray windows and a base pressure of 5 × 10−7
Torr. Samples were kept at room temperature and bom-
barded with a broad beam of 1 keV Ar+ ions, which were
generated by a 3-cm graphite-grid ion source from Veeco
Instruments Inc. placed at 65◦ ion incidence angle (θ),
as indicated in Fig. 1. This ion incidence angle was cho-
sen because it is known to cause self-organized rippling
on the silicon surface [24, 25]. The ion beam ﬂux was
measured to be 1 × 1015 ions cm−2s−1 at the operating
chamber pressure of 1 × 10−4 Torr. The ﬁnal ﬂuence
was 2.2 × 1018 ions cm−2. The ion beam was suﬃciently
broad that it uniformly covered the entire sample.

It is important to note that the coordinate system con-
vention of Fig. 1 follows that often used for GISAXS
experiments and is therefore rotated 90◦ with respect to
the coordinate system typically used in the ion bombard-
ment literature. Thus, in these experiments ”parallel-
mode” ripples form with their wavevector pointing in
the y-direction rather than in the x-direction, as would
conventionally be the situation in studies of ion beam
nanopatterning.

The experiments utilized 640 µm thick p-doped (B)
Si(100) wafers cut into 1 × 1 cm2 pieces and cleaned
with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and methanol. Samples
were ﬁrmly aﬃxed to a stage by Indium bonding. To pre-
vent sputtering of impurities onto the surface, the sample
stage geometry was designed to ensure that nothing was
above the sample surface. The temperature of the water-
cooled sample stage was monitored using a thermocouple
and the stage was electrically isolated except for a wire
leading out to an ammeter in order measure ion ﬂux. The

the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) of

Since qx is small, the horizontal component q|| (parallel
to the surface) can be approximated as simply qy and the
vertical component as qz (perpendicular to the surface).
In the analysis of this paper, we will primarily be inter-
ested in the scattering along the Yoneda wing (Fig. 3),
which is particularly sensitive to surface structure [26].
For simplicity, we will use the term “GISAXS pattern”
for the one-dimensional intensity curve I(q||, t) obtained
by averaging speckles in the detector vertical direction
(approximately qz) across the Yoneda wing as shown in
Fig. 3.

4M detector (Dectris) with 75 µm pixel size, which was
located 10.3 m from the sample. The incident X-ray an-
gle αi was 0.26◦, which is slightly above the critical angle
of total external reﬂection for silicon of 0.186◦. The pro-
jected incident X-ray beam direction on the sample was
perpendicular to the projected ion beam direction. This
allowed scattering in the GISAXS geometry to probe the
dominant direction of ripple formation for the chosen ion
bombardment angle. The diﬀuse scattering was recorded
as a function of the exit angle αf and ψ using the 2D
detector. The change in X-ray wavevector q can be cal-

where η(r, t) is a Gaussian white noise. For Sx > 0 and
Sy < 0, this produces ripples in the y-direction. Nu-
merical integrations were performed on a 2048 × 2048
lattice using the one-step Euler scheme for the tempo-
ral discretization with an integration step ∆t = 0.001.
The spatial derivatives were calculated by standard cen-
tral ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization method on a square
lattice with periodic boundary conditions. To check the
accuracy of our calculations, we also used the Lam-Shin
discretization [27] to compute nonlinear terms and found
the results were similar. In the simulations, the surface
is taken to be initially ﬂat. For comparison with exper-
iment, the lattice size and time units in the simulation
are set as 1 nm and 1 second respectively.

The linear coeﬃcients Sy and B in the simulation were
determined from a preliminary linear theory analysis of
the measured early-stage kinetics as discussed in Sect.
IV. The Sx coeﬃcient was assigned the same magnitude
as Sy, but with opposite sign based on the measurements
suggested by Norris et. al [25]. The amplitude of the
noise term < η2 > was also suggested by the linear the-
ory analysis of kinetics in the early time. The A and
nonlinear coeﬃcients were calculated from the sputter
yield Y (θ) curve as discussed in Pearson et al., [20]. In
sum, the parameters used in the simulations were: A =
-0.26 nm/s, Sx = 0.45 nm2/s, Sy = -0.45 nm2/s, B =
6.96 nm4/s, λx = 1.94 nm/s, λy = 1.94 nm/s, γy = 11.89
nm/s, < η2 > = 0.1 nm2/s2, ∆t = 0.001 s. For compari-
son with experiment, lattices were saved after every 1000

z, the intensity I(q||, t) becomes proportional to
the height-height structure factor, but for accuracy, the
exponential term is kept in the calculations.

The post facto AFM topographs show the development
of ripple structures (Fig. 2). The GISAXS pattern cal-
culated from the AFM images agrees well with the ﬁ-
nal GISAXS patterns actually observed as shown in Fig.
4. This allowed the measured GISAXS pattern to be
normalized to an absolute scale relative to surface struc-
ture height. Equation 3 gives the units of intensity as
(length)4, and so the resulting units of normalized inten-
sity here are nm4. This is a natural unit for surface scat-
tering and, when q(cid:48)
z is small, reﬂects that the intensity is
proportional to the height-height structure factor whose
two-dimensional integral in reciprocal space is equal to
the square of the RMS roughness.

In the experiments, ion bombardment started at t =
0 s, and a clear correlation peak can be seen growing
around t = 100 s due to the formation of correlated rip-
ples on the surface. The initial peak wavenumber is at

In order to connect simulated surfaces and post facto
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) topographs with X-ray

A linear theory analysis of the observed early-time
speckle-averaged kinetics thus allows extraction of exper-
imental values for the coeﬃcients Sy and B for compar-
ison with theoretical prediction and for use in the HPB
model simulations.

At early times, when surface roughness is small, the
x-ray scattering intensity I(q, t) is proportional to the
height-height structure factor, which can be calculated
from Eq. 4 to yield [24, 25]:

I(q, t)= (cid:104)h(q, t) h∗(q, t)(cid:105)

where n is the magnitude of the stochastic noise:
(cid:104)η (r, t) η (r(cid:48), t)(cid:105) = n δ(r − r(cid:48))δ(t − t(cid:48)).

To determine R(q||), the intensity values I(q||, t) were
ﬁrst averaged over 5 detector pixels in the q|| direction
and 100 pixels in the qz direction to remove speckle from
the scattering pattern. The temporal evolution of the
scattering from each wavenumber bin was then ﬁt with
a function of the form I(q||, t) = a(q||)e2R(q||)t + b(q||),
with a, b and R being the independent ﬁt parameters
5). The resulting R(q||) val-
for each q|| bin (Fig.
ues are shown in Fig.
5 with subsequent ﬁts to Eq.
5. The bumps in R(q||) at low q||’s on each side of
the GISAXS pattern are assumed to be due to overlap
with tails of the specularly reﬂected X-ray beam and
are not included in the R(q||) ﬁtting. Fit values are
Sy = −0.47 nm2s−1 and B = 7.27 nm4s−1. Nonlinear
least square ﬁtting was used for the ﬁts but, since R(q||)
at a high q|| has high error bars, Least Absolute Devia-
tion (LAD) and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) were also
examined; they gave similar results. The initial fastest
growing wavenumber according to the linear theory is
|| = (cid:112)|Sy|/(2B) = 0.18 nm−1.
qmax
The ﬁt values of the curvature coeﬃcient Sy and the
ion-induced viscous relaxation coeﬃcient B can be com-
pared with those obtained from ﬁts in previous non-
coherent real-time X-ray experiments by our group and
collaborators using an ion source with lower ﬂuxes.
Scaled up by the higher ion ﬂux here, Madi et al.
[24]
obtained Sy = -1 nm2s−1 and B = 5.5 nm4s−1. Thus
the values of B found between the two experiments dif-
fer by about 25% while there is approximately a factor
of two diﬀerence in the measurements of Sy. This level
of agreement/disagreement must be attributed to some
combination of diﬀerent ion sources, with ion ﬂux varied
by a factor of 500, and diﬀerent experimental set-ups.

For theoretical comparison with the measured Sy, we
examine the erosive formalism of Bradley and Harper
[8] and the redistributive formulism of Carter and Vish-
nyakov [9]
in accordance with our use of the HPB
model, while acknowledging that stress-driven theories
oﬀer competing views [11–15]. To evaluate the parame-
ters in the erosive and redistributive models we follow the
general approaches of Bobes et al. [30] and Hofs¨ass [31]

q0 ≈ 0.22 nm−1 so that the initial wavelength of rip-
ples is approximately 2π/0.22 nm−1 ≈ 28.6 nm. In Sect.
IV below, we quantitatively analyze this behavior using
linear theory of nanopatterning. A typical detector pat-
tern and GISAXS intensity patterns at particular times
in the evolution are shown in Fig. 3. After the time
regime of linear theory, coarsening occurs with the cor-
relation peak position ±q0 shifting to smaller wave num-
ber. The coarsening proceeds at an ever decreasing rate
and, by the end of the experiment, the average GISAXS
pattern changes only slowly; the ﬁnal ripple wavelength
suggested by the correlation peak position was approxi-
mately 2π/0.12 nm−1 ≈ 50 nm. In addition to the pri-
mary correlation peak at ±q0, a harmonic is seen to form
at ±2q0. These behaviors are analyzed below.

IV. SPECKLE-AVERAGED EARLY-TIME
KINETICS

At early stages of nanopatterning, when surface slopes
are small, nonlinear equations such as the HPB model
reduce to a more tractable linear stability theory which,
in reciprocal space, takes the form [8]:

∂˜h (q, t)
∂t

= R (q) ˜h (q, t) + ˜η (q, t)

(4)

where ˜h (q, t) is the Fourier transform of the surface
height h (r, t), R (q) is the ampliﬁcation factor or dis-
persion relation, and ˜η (q, t) is the Fourier transform of
a stochastic noise. The ampliﬁcation factor diﬀerentiates
surface stability or instability; a positive R(q) at a given
bombardment angle drives exponential ampliﬁcation of
modes of wavevector q resulting in surface instability,
while a negative R(q) damps ﬂuctuations and stabilizes
modes of wavevector q. In the x-ray measurement direc-
tion, R(q) is related to the parameters of the nonlinear
HPB theory Eq. 2 by:

R(qx ≈ 0, q||) ≡ R(q||) = −Sy q2

|| − B q4

rent experiments had not yet reached that regime.

FLUCTUATION DYNAMICS

The ripple correlation peaks coarsen with time, but at
an ever decreasing rate. Beyond t = 1000 s, the GISAXS
pattern changes very little - the peak moves only a few
pixels as shown in Fig. 6. While the range of time scales
available is too limited to make a deﬁnitive statement
about the nature of the relaxation, the peak motion can
be ﬁt as a weak power law evolution.

At late times, it’s well known that the ripples begin to
form asymmetric sawtooth structures. As a result, the
scattering pattern becomes asymmetric [35, 36]. Here
it’s observed in Fig. 3 that the correlation peak at −q0
grows slightly higher than the one at +q0. More in-
sight comes from the post facto AFM topograph, which
shows the asymmetric structure, as evidenced by the cut
through the topograph and the slope analysis shown in
Fig. 2. Simple calculations of the scattering expected
from a sawtooth structure show that, if the negative ter-
race slope is larger in magnitude than the positive ter-
race slope on the structure, the negative q|| peak should
be higher, as observed. In this case, the negative terrace
slope is facing the incoming ion beam. Such calculations
also show that, in this case, the harmonic peak at +2q0
should be higher than the one at −2q0, as is also ob-
served.

The simulations produce speckle-averaged GISAXS

scattering patterns (Fig.

Although the speckle-averaged GISAXS pattern shows
the average kinetics, the strength of coherent experiments
lies in their ability to measure temporal correlations of
the detailed speckle pattern through XPCS, illuminating
the underlying ﬂuctuation dynamics. The two-time cor-
relation function (TTCF) measures how the structure on
a given length scale changes between time t1 and time t2
as the sample evolves:

C(q||, t1, t2) =

(cid:10)I(q||, t1)I(q||, t2)(cid:11)
(cid:10)I(q||, t1)(cid:11) (cid:10)I(q||, t2)(cid:11)

(7)

where the angular brackets denote an average over equiv-
alent q|| values and the denominator values can be con-
sidered as speckle-averaged intensities one would have
obtained using non-coherent scattering.

TTCF’s are shown in Fig. 9 for a wavenumber q|| near
the scattering peak. The central diagonal ridge of corre-
lation going from the bottom left to top right indicates
the high correlation expected for t1 ≈ t2. One way to un-
derstand how a surface changes on a given length scale is
by observing the width of the central correlation ridge,
which is a measure of correlation time on the surface. As
seen in Fig. 9, the width continuously increases, but at
a steadily decreasing rate. At other wavenumbers, the
peak width appears to reach a constant value. Quan-

sample, the scattering from the sample increases and the
apparent contrast approaches its limiting value. Finally,
to improve statistics for the ﬁts to Eq. 8, results from ±
10 s around the central mean growth time T were chosen
for averaging.

Figure 10 shows the evolution of τ and n for selected
wavenumbers. Near the peak wavenumber q0, τ increases
continuously, ﬁrst rapidly and then more slowly. Away
from the peak, the τ values initially increase but then
seem to relax to a steady state. Near the peak, the relax-
ation exponent n rapidly increases from approximately
one, indicative of simple exponential decay, to 1.6-1.8,
showing compressed exponential behavior.

Figure 11 shows the behavior of τ as a function of
wavenumber q|| for selected times. It’s seen that the τ (q||)
values near the scattering peak ±q0 grow strongly to be-
come much larger than the relaxation times at smaller
and larger wavenumbers. This distinctive behavior is re-
produced in the simulations, as seen in Fig. 11.

Near the end of the experiment, when the correlations
are changing more slowly, more detail can be obtained
from averaging over a larger time period of T = 500 −
1000 s, i.e. mean T = 750 s, using the auto-correlation
function:

g2(q||, ∆t) =

(cid:10)I(q||, t(cid:48))I(q||, t(cid:48) + ∆t)(cid:11)
(cid:10)I(q||)(cid:11)2

.

(9)

The angular brackets indicate a time averaging over t(cid:48)
and equivalent q values. Again the calculated g2(q||, ∆t)
function is ﬁt with the KWW form Eq. 8.

Plots of experimental τ (q||) and n(q||) are shown in

FIG. 8. Top: A simulated lattice at t = 600 s. Bottom: Slope
distribution calculated from the simulated lattice image. Both
results can be compared with the measurements in Fig. 2.

titative measurement of the evolving dynamics is made
by taking diagonal cuts through the central ridge at a
constant average bombardment time T = (t1 + t2)/2 as
a function of ∆t = |t2 − t2| at each wavenumber q||. The
decay in correlation with time is ﬁt with the Kohlrausch-
Williams-Watts (KWW) form[38]:

gT
2 (q||, ∆t) = b + β(q||) e

−2( ∆t

τ (q|| ) )n(q|| )

,

(8)

where τ (q||) is the correlation time, and n(q||) is an expo-
nent which determines whether the function is a simple
(n = 1), stretched (0 < n < 1), or compressed (n > 1)
exponential. b is the baseline, which was set as 1 or al-
lowed to vary between 0.9 - 1.1. β(q||) describes the con-
trast, which depends on experimental factors including
the eﬀective resolution of the experiment. The magni-
tude of the central diagonal ridge of correlations in Fig.
9 increases with time, indicating an increasing contrast.
This is probably because background incoherent scatter-
ing (e.g. from slits or windows) causes the apparent con-
trast to decrease at early times when the scattering from
the sample is relatively small. As ripples form on the

τ|| is asymmetric, being higher at +q0 than at −q0, This
is the opposite direction of the relative peak intensities.
In addition, it’s seen that there is also a peak in τ (q||)
at the harmonic wavenumbers ±2q0. The peak of τ (q||)
appears to be relatively more pronounced at the har-
monic wavenumbers than does the corresponding peak
in the scattering I(q||) itself. Near the primary correla-
tion peaks ±q0, n(q||) > 1, so that the relaxation is com-
pressed exponential, as noted before. At higher values
of q||, n decreases to below one, indicative of stretched
exponential behavior.

The behavior of the simulations, also shown for com-
parison in Fig. 12, shows generally similar trends as ex-
periment, as discussed below.
In addition, it appears
that there may be a shoulder on n(q||) near the position
of the harmonic peaks ±2q0.

VII. DISCUSSION

The ﬁnal surface slope distribution clearly exhibits
asymmetry with preferential tendency toward a particu-
lar slope value, especially on the positive slope side (Fig.
2). The simulation slope distribution (Fig. 8) is also
asymmetric, though more compact. While the structure
does not reach a highly deﬁned sawtooth stage during the
period of these experiments, it appears to be moving to-
ward such structure. Consistent with the developing rip-

ple asymmetry, both the experiment and simulation show
that asymmetries develop in the intensities of the ripple
correlation peaks at ±q|| (Figs. 3 and 7). The asym-
metry is more prominent for the experiments than for
the simulations. However, peaks at the ripple wavenum-
ber ±q0 in the simulated speckle-averaged intensity are
sharper in the simulation, with the harmonic peaks be-
ing signiﬁcantly more pronounced. This reﬂects that the
simulated lattice looks more ordered (Fig. 8) compared
to the experiment (Fig. 2).

The experiments and simulations show rich structure
in the development of the correlation dynamics as seen
in the parameters τ (q||) and n(q||). For τ (q||), on length
scales of the ripple structure, local structure is becoming
ever more long-lived as coarsening progresses (Figs. 9,
10 and 11). For a total patterning time of T = 700 s, the
correlation time for local ripple structure is about 240 s.
This qualitative behavior does not come as a surprise.
However, actual experimental conﬁrmation of the evolv-
ing longevity is rare and, to our knowledge, the ability
of coherent x-ray scattering to quantify the behavior is
currently unique outside of the specialized environment
of FIB/SEM instruments.

Figures 11 and 12 show that, near the peak wavenum-
bers ± q0, the scattering intensity initially grows much
more rapidly than does the correlation time τ , but that
at later times the intensity grows only slowly while τ con-
tinues to grow signiﬁcantly. Eventually τ (q||) develops a
peak on length scales corresponding to the ripple wave-

There is a secondary peak in relaxation times
at the harmonic wavenumber ±2q0 of the ripples.
It’s
noteworthy that, just as the peaks in the simulation in-
tensity at ±q0 are sharper than in experiment, so too the
peaks in τ (q||) are sharper in the simulation. There are
also diﬀerences in behavior of the experiment and simu-
lations for τ (q||) near the origin q|| = 0. However, there
are reasons for additional care in trusting results in this
range because, in the experiment, the scattered x-rays
may be mixing with the tails of the specular beam and,
in the simulations, ﬁnite size eﬀects presumably become
important.

The τ (q||) values are noticeably higher on the posi-
tive side of the q|| axis, particularly in the experimental
results. Presumably this reﬂects asymmetry in the dy-
namic processes on the two sides of the ripples. The HPB
theory predicts rich dynamics on the terraces of the late-
stage sawtooth structures [21], so this may be related.
However, we have not been able to construct a simple
model explaining the asymmetry.

Summarizing comparison of ripple structure, intensi-
ties and correlation times, while there is more order to
the ripple pattern in the simulations than in the exper-
imental results, there is more asymmetry in the experi-
ment as observed in both the speckle-averaged intensity
I(q||) and τ (q||). It should be noted that there is uncer-
tainty in the coeﬃcients of the terms entering the HPB
simulations because of uncertainty in Y (θ) and no at-
tempt was made to vary the coeﬃcients in an ad hoc
manner to seek better agreement. Moreover, no attempt
was made to include any eﬀects associated with initial
surface structure [39, 40], though we expect those to be
small since experiments started with a polished Si wafer.
Turning to the relaxation exponent n(q||), at early
times the ﬂuctuation relaxation processes are consistent
with being simple exponential in nature (i.e. exponent n
= 1), as expected for linear theory behavior. As pattern-
ing continues, however, Figs. 10 and 11 show that the
relaxation exponents n(q) evolve in both the experiments
and the simulations, with the system exhibiting com-
pressed exponential relaxation on length scales compara-
ble to or longer than that of the ripples and stretched ex-
ponential relaxation on much shorter length scales. The
simulations show clear peaks in n(q||) at slightly higher
|q||| than the intensity peak positions ±q0. These are
less clear in the experimental results, but those results
are also suggestive, especially on the positive side of the
q|| axis. Why relaxation exponents should peak there is
unknown.

x, h2

As we noted in Ref. [41], a common feature of nonlin-
ear models of ion beam nanopatterning is the inclusion
of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) quadratic nonlineari-
ties h2
y. For small ∆t, simulations of the KPZ model
are well ﬁt with compressed exponential behavior [42]
and the leading terms in the KPZ model dynamics [43]
suggest an eﬀective exponent n ≈ (2 + 2α)/z ≈ 1.74,
where α and z are the roughness and dynamic expo-
nents respectively for (2+1) dimensional growth. Thus,

10

the KPZ eﬀective compressed exponent n for small ∆t
is approximately equal to that observed at the nanorip-
ple wavenumber peaks ±q0 in the present experiments.
It is unknown whether the HPB equation is in the KPZ
universality class at long length scales, though the relax-
ation exponents found here appear to be similar. As we
noted previously, the inclusion of lower order terms [22]
in the minimal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (aKS) equation re-
produces some of the kinetics features observed here, and
the aKS equation is known to exhibit KPZ dynamics at
large length scales. This could potentially provide a clear
connection with the KPZ behavior.

As we also discuss in Ref.

[41], the strong peak in
intensity and correlation times at the ripple wavenum-
bers ±q0 is reminiscent of de Gennes narrowing in liq-
uids. Moreover, as discussed there, compressed exponen-
tial decay observed here on length scales comparable to
the ripple wavelength suggests the absence of short decay
times and may be related to the concept of structural
In contrast, the lower exponents observed
persistence.
at longer and shorter length scales suggests exponential
or even stretched exponential behavior at early times,
possibly indicating the lack of such persistence. More-
over, compressed exponential behavior at short times ∆t
in both soft materials [44] and metallic glasses [45] has
been attributed to collective ballistic ﬂow of local struc-
tures due to internal stress relaxation. It’s notable that
some theoretical approaches to understanding ion beam
nanopatterning use ﬂuid dynamic models with stress re-
laxation as a driving force [11–15]. These might provide
a direct connection between the compressed exponential
behavior of ion beam nanopatterning observed here and
that observed in glasses. This would be an attractive
direction for future study.
