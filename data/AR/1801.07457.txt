ABSTRACT

We present an investigation of the rotation and non-radial motion of a coronal mass

ejection (CME) from AR 12468 on 2015 December 16 using observations from SDO,

SOHO, STEREO A and Wind. The EUV and HMI observations of the source region

show that the associated magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) axis pointed to the east before the

eruption. We use a nonlinear fore-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation to determine the

conﬁguration of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld and calculate the magnetic energy density

distributions at diﬀerent heights. The distribution of the magnetic energy density

shows a strong gradient toward the northeast. The propagation direction of the CME

from a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) modeling deviates from the radial direction

of the source region by about 45◦ in longitude and about 30◦ in latitude, which is

consistent with the gradient of the magnetic energy distribution around the AR. The

MFR axis determined by the GCS modeling points southward, which has rotated

counterclockwise by about 95◦ compared with the orientation of the MFR in the low

corona. The MFR reconstructed by a Grad-Shafranov (GS) method at 1 AU has almost

the same orientation as the MFR from the GCS modeling, which indicates that the

MFR rotation occurred in the low corona. It is the rotation of the MFR that caused

the intense geomagnetic storm with the minimum Dst of –155 nT. These results suggest

that the coronal magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the MFR plays a crucial role in the MFR

rotation and propagation direction.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld from the

Sun and are a major driver of space weather eﬀects. When propagating in the heliosphere, they

are called interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). A previous study suggests that at least 40% of CMEs

observed by SOHO/LASCO have a clear magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) structure (Vourlidas et al. 2013).

In the low corona of the active region (AR), an MFR structure is manifested as a hot channel

(HC), a high-temperature erupting structure seen in EUV observations (e.g., Cheng et al. 2013, 2014;

Zhang et al. 2012). When a CME propagates from the Sun, it has a three-part structure in white-light

observations: the white leading edge, core and dark cavity (Illing & Hundhausen 1985; Forsyth et al.

2006). The dark cavity is thought to be the MFR structure. The propagation direction of a CME

MFR will determine whether it can arrive at Earth, and the orientation of a CME MFR will determine

its southward magnetic ﬁeld component at the Earth (e.g., Liu et al. 2010, 2016; Savani et al. 2015;

Kilpua et al. 2012; Isavnin et al. 2014). Therefore, understanding the propagation and rotation of a

CME MFR in the inner heliosphere is of crucial importance for space weather forecasting.

The propagation direction of a CME can deviate from the radial direction of the CME source

region. The magnetic force produced by the coronal magnetic ﬁeld plays an important role in CME

propagation direction (MacQueen et al. 1986; Kilpua et al. 2009). Shen et al. (2011) and Gui et al.

(2011) use the gradient of coronal magnetic energy density to explain the deﬂection of a CME in

the low corona and suggest that the deﬂection is toward the region of the lower magnetic energy.

Kay et al. (2013, 2015) develop a Forecasting CMEs Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model to predict

CME trajectory. Heliospheric current sheets (HCSs) and coronal holes (CHs), which correspond to

minimum and maxmum energy regions on the solar surface, respectively, are important factors that

can deﬂect CMEs (Kilpua et al. 2009; Gopalswamy et al. 2009; Liewer et al. 2015). Recent studies

have demonstrated that CMEs can be deﬂected not only by the nearby large-scale structure, such as

HCSs and CHs, but also can be channelled by the strong magnetic ﬁeld in the CME source region

itself (M¨ostl et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2017). CMEs can also change their propagation

direction in interplanetary space by interacting with fast solar wind streams and other CMEs (e.g.,

Liu et al. 2014, 2016; Lugaz et al. 2012; Gopalswamy et al. 2001; Kataoka et al. 2015).

CME MFRs have been observed to rotate frequently (e.g., Vourlidas et al. 2011; Thompson et al.

2012; Liu et al. 2008b, 2010). Liu et al. (2010) suggest that a CME can exhibit a signiﬁcant rotation

during its propagation in the inner heliosphere by comparing the orientations of a CME MFR from

the GCS modeling and the in situ reconstruction at 1 AU. MFR rotation in the corona has also been

observed during CME eruption. Green et al. (2007) ﬁnd that the direction of the MFR rotation is

determined by the sign of helicity of the source region. For positive (negative) helicity, the MFR

rotates clockwise (counterclockwise). This implies that the conversion of twist into writhe in a kink-

unstable magnetic ﬂux rope is a possible mechanism for the rotation (Kliem et al. 2012). As the

orientation of MFR is a crucial parameter determining its geo-eﬀectiveness, numerical simulations

have been employed to understand the physical mechanism for the MFR rotation. T¨or¨ok & Kliem

4

Liu et al.

(2003, 2005) ﬁnd that vortex ﬂows at the MFR foot points can drive a signiﬁcant rotation (more

than 90◦) in an ideal MHD model. It suggests that the kink instability can cause the rotation. Using

a similar model, Fan & Gibson (2004) obtain a larger rotation (almost 120◦). Applying a breakout

model in which the eruption starts with a developed MFR, Lynch et al. (2009) argue that the right-

handed (left-handed) MFR rotates clockwise (counterclockwise) with a constant rate of about 30◦/R⊙,

reaching a rotation angle of about 50◦ at a height of 3.5 R⊙. Based on observational or numerical

studies, other mechanisms that cause MFR rotation have been suggested, such as reconnection with

the ambient magnetic ﬁeld (Cohen et al. 2010; Thompson 2011; Lugaz et al. 2011) and alignment

with the heliosphere current sheet (Yurchyshyn 2008; Yurchyshyn et al. 2009). Interested readers are

directed to Manchester et al. (2017) for a review of CME MFR rotation as well as deﬂection.

In the present paper, we investigate the propagation characteristics of the CME MFR from AR

12468 on 2015 December 16, using extreme ultraviolet, magnetogram, white-light and in situ obser-

vations from SDO, SOHO, STEREO A, and Wind. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2,

we describe the solar source signatures from AIA and HMI observations, and reconstruct the conﬁg-

uration of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of the source region with a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF)

method and examine the magnetic energy density distribution at diﬀerent heights.

In sections 3

and 4, the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) method and Grad-Shafranov (GS) model are used to

reconstruct the 3D structure of the MFR in the corona and at 1 AU to analyse the propagation and

the rotation of the CME MFR. This study illustrates the important role of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld

around AR in the CME MFR rotation and propagation direction.

2. OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOURCE ACTIVE REGION

2.1. AIA and HMI Observations

Observaions of the Rotation and non-radial motion of MFR

The source region of the eruption event is AR 12468 (S15W15).

It produced a halo-like CME

and a C6.6 ﬂare on 2015 December 16. The ﬂare started at 8:25 UT and peaked at 9:00 UT. The

source region was well covered by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012)

and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics

Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). AIA images the solar atmosphere at temperatures ranging

from 0.06 MK to 20 MK through 10 passbands (7 EUV and 3 UV passbands). The image has a

temporal cadence of 12 s (EUV) / 24 s (UV) and spatial resolution of 1′′.2. The HMI provides high

time resolution magnetograms with a 45 s cadence and vector magnetic ﬁeld data with a 12 min

cadence. Its spatial resolution is 1′′.0.

Figure 1 shows SDO/AIA 131 ˚A and HMI observations of the source region before the eruption.

The S-shaped hot channel marked by the red dotted curve in Figure 1(a) is regarded as the MFR

producing the CME. The S-shape of the hot channel shows that the chirality of the MFR is likely

right-handed (e.g. Canﬁeld et al. 1999; Green & Kliem 2014). The contours of the photospheric

magnetic ﬁeld along the line of sight from a SDO/ HMI magnetogram are overlaid on the EUV

image in Figure 1(a). According to the contours, the MFR rooted in the strong negative polarity

sunspot in the north and the strong positive polarity sunspot in the south. The orientation of the

polarity inversion line (PIL) is almost from the west to the east. The axial ﬁeld of the MFR comes

from the positive polarity sunspot to the positive polarity sunspot, so the axis of MFR points to

the east (marked by the arrow in Figure 1(b)). The angle between the orientation of the central

part of the MFR and the horizontal direction (east) is about 5◦. The MFR poloidal ﬁeld comes out

of the photosphere in the south and goes into the photosphere in the north of the PIL. For such a

ﬁeld conﬁguration, the MFR should be right-handed. The MFR was aligned with the PIL before its

eruption, which can be seen from the AIA EUV observations. At 8:00 UT, it started to expand and

rise.

6

Liu et al.

Figure 2 shows the EUV structures of the source region during the eruption of the MFR. The

contours of SDO/ HMI magnetograms are overlaid on the EUV images. The MFR from the SDO/AIA

131 ˚A image (Figure 1(a)) is indicated by the black dotted curve in Figure 2(a). The EUV loops

overlying the MFR and the open EUV structures surrounding the MFR are marked in the AIA 171

˚A images. At 8:00 UT, the MFR started to rise and then erupted in the AIA EUV observations.

Figure 2(a)-(d) show that the EUV loops at the north of the MFR were pushed away by the CME

MFR from 8:10 UT to 8:40 UT. The arrow pointing to the northeast in Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c)

shows the propagation direction of the disturbance along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines. Therefore,

we can roughly estimate that the CME MFR was propagating to the northeast.

2.2. Coronal Magnetic Field Reconstruction

We use an NLFFF method to understand the relation between the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-

ration and the propagation of the CME MFR in the low corona. The NLFFF method is proposed by

Wheatland et al. (2000) and extended by Wiegelmann (2004) and Wiegelmann & Inhester (2010).

We employ the NLFFF code, which has been optimized for application to SDO/HMI vector mag-

netograms (Wiegelmann et al. 2012), to extrapolate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld from the observed

vector magnetograms in a Cartesian domain. This extrapolation method works well by comparing

the extrapolated magnetic ﬁelds with observed EUV structures as shown in previous studies (e.g.,

Vemareddy et al. 2013, 2016; Guo et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2014, 2015). Here, we bin the data to

about 1′′.0 per pixel and adopt a computation domain of 512 × 256 × 160 grids.

Figure 3 diplays the comparison between the EUV images and the NLFFF extrapolation. The

NLFFF extrapolation results of the source region are shown from diﬀerent viewpoints. We use

diﬀerent colors to distinguish diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux bundles. The NLFFF reconstruction gives an

MFR structure that is consistent with the hot channel in the EUV images before the eruption at 08:24

Observaions of the Rotation and non-radial motion of MFR

UT. The open ﬂux bundles (in Figure 3(c) and (d)) coming from the positive polarity sunspot in the

south of the MFR look like a wall inclining to the northeast. The strong magnetic pressure from the

positive sunspot may change the propagation direction of the MFR as well as its axis orientation.

We now calculate the magnetic energy density εB = B2/2µ0, using the reconstruction results, where

the coronal magnetic ﬁeld B is from the NLFFF extrapolation and µ0 is the vacuum permeability.

Figure 4 plots the magnetic energy density distribution around the CME source region overlying

the MFR before the eruption at heights of 1.07 R⊙ and 1.14 R⊙, respectively. The black and white

diamonds mark the footpoints of the MFR on the solar surface. The arrow shows the orientation

and position of the central part of the MFR before the eruption that likely impact the Earth. The

distribution of the magnetic energy density shows a strong gradient descent toward the northeast.

Comparing the magnetogram contours in Figure 3(a) with the magnetic energy density distribution

at 1.07 R⊙, we can see that the peak of the energy density distribution corresponds to the sunspots

in the south of the MFR. It suggests that the gradient descent is largely produced by the sunspots

in the south of the MFR. The magnetic ﬁeld surrounding the MFR may inﬂuence the propagation

direction and axis orientation of the MFR. The present magnetic energy gradient suggest that the

erupting MFR would propagate toward the northeast.

3. MFR CHARACTERISTICS IN THE EXTENDED CORONA

During 2015 December 16 CME, the STEREO A spacecraft was 166.5◦ east of the Earth and

at a distance of 0.96 AU from the Sun. Communications with STEREO B were lost from 2014

October 1. We use the beacon images of STEREO A as the science data on 2015 December 16 are

not available. The CME is observed as a halo-like CME by SOHO/LASCO. In order to determine

the propagation direction of the CME and the orientation of the MFR in the extended corona, we

employ simultaneous two-point (STEREO A and SOHO/LASCO) white-light observations with the

8

Liu et al.

graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model (Thernisien et al. 2006, 2009). It has six free parameters:

the longitude and latitude of the propagation direction, the tilt angle of the ﬂux rope, the height of

the CME leading front, the half-angle between the two legs of the ﬂux rope, and the aspect ratio

of the CME ﬂux rope. The coronagraph observations and the modeling of the CME are displayed

in Figure 5. The wireframe rendering obtained from the GCS model is consistent with the observed

images from the two viewpoints. The resulting parameters are listed in Table 1. The propagation

direction of the CME deviates by about 45◦ to the east and about 30◦ to the north from the radial

direction of the source region (S15W15). This change is consistent with what the gradient of the

coronal magnetic energy distribution predicts. The tilt angle of the MFR from the GCS model is

–80◦. The axis of the MFR may point to the south or north. In any case, the axis orientation of the

MFR has changed in the corona by comparing with the orientation of the MFR in the source region.

These results reveal that the rotation and non-radial motion of the CME MFR occurred very close to

the sun as suggested by Kay et al. (2013, 2015). Vourlidas et al. (2011) also shows a rotation during

the early evolution of the associated CME.

4. MFR CHARACTERISTICS AT 1 AU AND RELATION TO GEOMAGNETIC ACTIVITY

The in situ measurements associated with the CME on 2015 December 16 at Wind are presented

in Figure 6. A shock passed Wind at 15:40 UT on 2015 December 19. A magnetic cloud (MC) is

identiﬁed with the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld parameters. The magnetic ﬁeld is measured in RTN

coordinates (in which R points from the Sun to the spacecraft, T is parallel to the solar equatorial

plane and points to the planet motion direction, and N completes the right-handed triad). The

magnetic ﬁeld strength ﬁrst increases to about 20 nT and then decreases smoothly. The T component

is largely positive, the R component rotates from positive to negative, and the N component rotates

from negative to positive. The Dst proﬁle indicates a two-step geomagnetic storm sequence with a

Observaions of the Rotation and non-radial motion of MFR

global minimum of –155 nT. The ﬁrst dip is produced by the southward magnetic ﬁeld component

in the sheath region behind the shock, while the second one is caused by the southward ﬁeld within

the MC that is as high as –20 nT and lasts for about 24 hours. The modeled Dst index using the

O’Brien & McPherron (2000) formula (minimum –156 nT) agrees with the observed Dst well, where

the Burton et al. (1975) method gives a deeper globe minimum (–244 nT) than observed.

We use a Grad-Shafranov (GS) method (Hau & Sonnerup 1999; Hu & Sonnerup 2002) to recon-

struct the MC structure, which has been validated by well-separated, multi-spacecraft measurements

(Liu et al. 2008a). The GS reconstruction also helps determine the boundaries of the MC. There is

also a signiﬁcant southward ﬁeld component ahead of the resulting MC leading edge (see Figure 6).

The magnetic ﬁeld strength, however, is not smooth. The GS method is sensitive to the boundaries.

When interval with southward ﬁelds starting from about 3:00 UT to 16:00 UT on 2015 December

20 is included, the GS method cannot give a reasonable reconstruction. The reconstruction result

are shown in Figure 7. The right-handed ﬂux-rope structure resulting from the GS reconstruction

is consistent with the MFR structure in the source region. It has an elevation angle of about –70◦

and an azimuthal angle of about 100◦ in RTN coordinates of the Earth. The maximum value of the

axial magnetic ﬁeld is 17.7 nT, comparable to the total magnetic ﬁeld strength. The axial magnetic

ﬁeld component is the main contributor to the southward magnetic ﬁeld producing the geomagnetic

storm, given the almost southward axis orientation.

Figure 8 shows the axis orientations of the MFR from diﬀerent observations. The axis elevation

angle and azimuthal angle of the MFR at 1 AU are –70◦ and 100◦, respectively (OC in Figure 8).

The axis of the MFR at 1 AU largely points southward. If the axial magnetic ﬁeld did not change

its sign during the propagation in the inner heliosphere, the orientation of the MFR from the GCS

model would also largely point to the south. The aixs orientation of the MFR at 1 AU is thus almost

aligned with the orientation of the MFR in the extended corona (OB in Figure 8). Comparing with

10

Liu et al.

the MFR orientation in the source region (OA in Figure 8), we can see that the axis has rotated by

about 95◦. These results indicate that the rotation of the MFR may have occurred mainly in the low

corona. The MFR axis was largely horizontal in the source region but became almost southward in

the extended corona and at 1 AU. It is the rotation of the ﬂux rope that has resulted in the intense

geomagnetic storm.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

We have investigated the rotation and non-radial motion of a CME MFR from AR 12468 (S15W15)

on 2015 December 16, using the EUV, magnetogram, white-light and in situ observations from SDO,

SOHO, STEREO A, and Wind. We use an NLFFF model to extrapolate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld

arroud the AR, a GCS method to determine the propagation direction and orientation of the MFR

near the Sun, and a GS reconstruction technique to derive the magnetic structure of the MFR at

1 AU and understand its relationship to the geomagnetic activity. The results are summarized and

discussed as follows.

1. The CME changed its propagation direction by about 45◦ in latitude and about 30◦ in longitude

in the low corona due to the asymmetric distribution of the magnetic energy around the source region.

We obtain the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of the AR from the NLFFF method. The open magnetic ﬁelds

surrounding the MFR incline to the northeast of the source region. In order to evaluate the inﬂuence

of the magnetic pressure on the CME propagation direction, we analyse the the magnetic energy

density distributions at diﬀerent heights based on the NLFFF extrapolation results. The magnetic

energy density distribution on each layer shows a gradient descent toward the northeast of the AR,

which is consistent with the CME propagation direction. This indicates that the coronal magnetic

ﬁeld context of the AR plays an important role in the CME propagation direction.

2. The MFR rotated counterclockwise by about 95◦ in the low corona during the eruption, which,

Observaions of the Rotation and non-radial motion of MFR

11

again, can be attributed to the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration around the AR. The error in the

MFR orientation in our case cannot be rigorously determined, but is roughly 20◦ at the source, 20◦ in

the corona from the GCS method, and 10◦-30◦ from GS reconstruction. These errors may not aﬀect

our conclusion on the MFR rotation here, which is about 95◦. Compared with the MFR on the solar

surface before eruption, the MFR obtained from the GCS model in white-light observations rotated

by about 95◦ counterclockwise. The near-Earth MFR from GS reconstuction has almost the same

orientation as the MFR from the GCS model. The MFR was nearly horizontal in the solar source

region, but became largely southward in the extended corona and near the Earth. Therefore, the

rotation of the MFR plays an important role in the generation of the intense geomagnetic storm. Pre-

vious studies of the kink stability (Green et al. 2007) and of the magnetic tension force (Lynch et al.

2009) suggest that the rotation direction of an MFR is determined by the sign of helicity of the

source region: the positive (right-handed) ones rotate clockwise while the negative (left-handed) ones

rotate counterclockwise. In our case, the MFR is right-hand but rotates counterclockwise. However,

the possibility of a clockwise rotation for 265◦, which would result in the same orientation as in the

extended corona, can not be completely excluded. In any case, the geometry of the MFR in relation

to the AR coronal magnetic ﬁeld context is considered to be an important factor for the rotation.

Contours of –800, –400, 400 and 800 G of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld along the line of sight from HMI

magnetograms are overlaid on the EUV images and are marked in blue, cyan, green and red, respectively.

The black dotted curve in (a) shows the location of the MFR from SDO /AIA 131 ˚A. The loops overlying the

MFR and the open EUV structures surrounding the MFR are marked respectively in (a)-(c). The arrow in

(b) and (c) shows the expansion direction of the overlying loops. The open EUV structures are also marked

in (d).

Figure 6. Solar wind plasma and magnetic ﬁeld parameters associated with the CME at Wind. From top

to bottom, the panels show the proton density, bulk speed, proton temperature, magnetic ﬁeld strength

and components, and Dst index, respectively. The dotted line in the third panel denotes the expected

proton temperature calculated from the observed speed (Lopez 1987). The blue and red dashed curves in

the bottom panel represent Dst values estimated with the southward magnetic ﬁeld component in GSM

coordinates using the formulae of O’Brien & McPherron (2000) and Burton et al. (1975), respectively. The

shaded region indicates the magnetic cloud interval determined by the GS reconstruction, and the vertical

dashed line marks the associated shock.

Figure 7. Reconstructed cross section of the magnetic cloud at Wind. Black contours show the distribution

of the vector potential, and the color shading indicates the value of the axial magnetic ﬁeld scaled by the

color bar on the right. The location of the maximum axial ﬁeld is indicated by the white cross. The

dashed line marks the trajectory of Wind. The thin black arrows denote the direction and magnitude of the

observed magnetic ﬁelds projected onto the cross section, and the thick colored arrows show the projected

RTN directions.
