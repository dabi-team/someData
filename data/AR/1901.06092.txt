Abstract

The anti-Ramsey problem was introduced by Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os in 1970s.
The anti-Ramsey number of a hypergraph H, ar(n, s, H), is the smallest integer c such
that in any coloring of the edges of the s-uniform complete hypergraph on n vertices
with exactly c colors, there is a copy of H whose edges have distinct colors. In this paper,
we determine the anti-Ramsey numbers of linear paths and loose paths in hypergraphs
for suﬃciently large n, and give bounds for the anti-Ramsey numbers of Berge paths.
Similar exact anti-Ramsey numbers are obtained for linear/loose cycles, and bounds are
obtained for Berge cycles. Our main tools are path extension technique and stability
results on hypergraph Tur´an problems of paths and cycles.

Introduction

The anti-Ramsey number of a graph G, denoted by ar(n, G), is the minimum number
of colors needed to color the edges of the complete graph Kn so that, in any coloring, there
exists a copy of G whose edges have distinct colors. The Tur´an number of a graph G,
denoted by ex(n, G), is the maximum number of edges in a graph on n vertices that does
not contain G as a subgraph. It is easy to observe that

2 + ex(n, {H − e, e ∈ E(H)}) ≤ ar(n, H) ≤ ex(n, H) + 1,

(1)

for any graph H.

In 1973, Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os [11] showed a remarkable result that ar(n, Kp) =
ex(n, Kp−1) + 2 for suﬃciently large n. Montellano-Ballesteros and Neumann-Lara [35]
extended this result to all values of n and p with n > p ≥ 3. In [11], it was shown that
ar(n, H) − ex(n, {H − e, e ∈ E(H)}) = o(n2) when n → ∞. Furthermore, Jiang [29]
proved that if H is a graph such that each edge is incident to a vertex of degree two, then
ar(n, H) − ex(n, {H − e, e ∈ E(H)}) = O(n). A history of results and open problems on
this topic was given by Fujita, Magnant, and Ozeki [18].

A hypergraph H consists of a set V (H) of vertices and a family E(H) of nonempty subsets
of V (H) called edges of H. If each edge of H has exactly s vertices, then H is s-uniform
and H is called an s-graph. A complete s-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph whose edge
set consists of all s-subsets of the vertex set. In an edge-coloring of a (hyper)graph H, a
sub(hyper)graph F ⊆ H is rainbow if all edges of F have distinct colors.

The anti-Ramsey number and Tur´an number are naturally extended from graphs to hy-
pergraphs. The anti-Ramsey number of an s-uniform hypergraph H, denoted by ar(n, s, H),
is the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges of a complete s-uniform hyper-
graph on n vertices so that there exists a rainbow H in any coloring. The Tur´an number
of H, denoted by ex(n, s, H), is the maximum number of edges in an s-uniform hypergraph
on n vertices that contains no H. ¨Ozkahya and Young [39] investigated the anti-Ramsey
number of matchings in hypergraphs, where a matching is a set of edges in a (hyper)graph
in which no two edges have a common vertex. A k-matching, denoted by Mk, is a matching
with k edges. ¨Ozkahya and Young [39] gave the lower and upper bounds for ar(n, s, Mk)
in terms of ex(n, s, Mk−1). They proved that

ex(n, s, Mk−1) + 2 ≤ ar(n, s, Mk) ≤ ex(n, s, Mk−1) + k,

where the lower bound holds for every n, and the upper bound holds for n ≥ sk + (s −
1)(k − 1). For s = 2, Schiermeyer [40] proved that ar(n, 2, Mk) = ex(n, 2, Mk−1) + 2 for
k ≥ 2 and n ≥ 3k + 3, and this condition was further released to all n ≥ 2k + 1 by Chen,
Li and Tu [5] and by Fujita, Kaneko, Schiermeyer and Suzuki [17], independently.

[sk−1]
s

In fact, for k-matchings, the Tur´an number ex(n, s, Mk) is still not known for k ≥ 3 and
[n]
s ≥ 3. Let [n] denote the set {1, 2, . . . , n},
denote the set consisting of all the k-sets of
k
[n]. Erd˝os put forward a conjecture in 1965 that ex(n, s, Mk) = max{|As|, |Bs(n)|}, where
(cid:1)
|F ∩ [k − 1] 6= ∅}. This conjecture is true for s = 2,
As =
which was shown by Erd˝os and Gallai [10]. In [9], Erd˝os proved that there exists a constant
n0(s, k) such that for n > n0(s, k), the conjecture holds. Then Bollob´as, Daykin and Erd˝os
[1] improved the bound for n0(k, s) such that n0(k, s) ≤ 2s3(k − 1). It was improved to
n0(k, s) ≤ 3s2(k − 1) by Huang, Loh and Sudakov [28] later.

For the anti-Ramsey number of k-matching, ¨Ozkahya and Young [39] conjectured that

when k ≥ 3, ar(n, s, Mk) = ex(n, s, Mk−1) + 2 if n > sk, and

ar(n, s, Mk) =

ex(n, s, Mk−1) + 2
ex(n, s, Mk−1) + s + 1

if k ≤ cs,
if k ≥ cs,

(

if n = sk, where cs is a constant dependent on s. They proved that the conjecture is
true when k = 2, 3 for suﬃciently large n. Later, Frankl and Kupavskii [16] proved that
ar(n, s, Mk) = ex(n, s, Mk−1) + 2 for n ≥ sk + (s − 1)(k − 1) and k ≥ 3. For more results
on matchings, we refer to [13, 15].

For paths, Simonovits and S´os [41] proved that ar(n, P2t+3+ǫ) = tn −

+ 1 + ǫ for
large n, where ǫ = 0, 1 and Pk is a path on k vertices. Comparing with the Tur´an number
of paths

ex(n, Pk) ≤ (k − 2)n/2

given by Erd˝os and Gallai [10], it follows that ar(n, Pk) = ex(n, Pk−1) + O(1) when k
is odd, and ar(n, Pk) = ex(n, Pk−2) + O(1) when k is even. For a cycle Ck of order k,
Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os [11] conjectured that ar(n, Ck) = n
+ O(1). This
conjecture was conﬁrmed by Montellano-Ballesteros and Neumann-Lara [36], and they gave
the exact value of ar(n, Ck) for all n ≥ k ≥ 3. It would be interesting to investigate the
relation between the anti-Ramsey number and the Tur´an number for paths and cycles in
hypergraphs. The Tur´an numbers of paths and cycles are extensively studied, see [12, 19,
20, 33] or Section 2 below for details. Motivated by this, we will study the anti-Ramsey
numbers of paths and cycles and compare it with the Tur´an numbers of paths and cycles
in hypergraphs.

There are several possible ways to deﬁne paths and cycles in hypergraphs as generaliza-

tion of paths and cycles in graphs from diﬀerent aspects.

Deﬁnition 1.1 Let H be an s-uniform hypergraph.

(i) A Berge path of length k in H is a family of k distinct edges e1, . . . , ek and k + 1
distinct vertices v1, . . . , vk+1 such that for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, ei contains vi and vi+1. Let Bk
denote the family of Berge paths of length k. A Berge cycle of length k in H is a cyclic
list of k distinct edges e1, . . . , ek and k distinct vertices v1, . . . , vk such that ei contains vi
and vi+1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, where vk+1 = v1. Denote the family of all Berge cycles of
length k by BCk.

(ii) A loose path of length k in H is a collection of distinct edges {e1, e2, . . . , ek}
such that consecutive edges intersect in at least one element and nonconsecutive edges are
disjoint. Denote the family of loose paths of length k by Pk. A loose cycle is deﬁned
similarly in a cyclic order, and denote the family of all loose cycles of length k by Ck.

(iii) A linear path of length k in H is a collection of distinct edges {e1, e2, . . . , ek}
such that consecutive edges intersect in exactly one element and nonconsecutive edges are
disjoint. Let Pk denote the linear path of length k. A linear cycle is deﬁned similarly in
a cyclic order, and let Ck denote the collection of linear path of length k.

For linear paths and loose paths, we obtain the exact anti-Ramsey numbers for suﬃ-

ciently large n.

We remark that, due to some technique obstruction, our proof of Theorem 1.2 does not
work directly for the case k = 5 or the case k is odd and s = 3. However, those special
cases are handled in Theorem 1.3 for loose path with a reﬁned analysis.

The methods developed in proving Theorems 1.2 and 1.3, with additional eﬀort and
some new ideas, allow us to determine the anti-Ramsey numbers of linear cycles and loose
cycles as well, if k and s are not too small. We obtain the following exact results for linear
cycles and loose cycles.

many n. Then Davoodi, Gy¨ori, Methuku and Tompkins [8] proved that ex(n, s, Bs+1) ≤ n.
We apply those results to obtain the bounds for the anti-Ramsey number ar(n, s, Bk) as
follows.

Theorem 1.6 indicates that the anti-Ramsey number ar(n, s, Bk) varies for diﬀerent s
and k. This may suggest that determining the exact value of ar(n, s, Bk) would be very
diﬃcult. Note that the Tur´an number of Berge path is still not clear at this moment.

However, it seems that the anti-Ramsey numbers of Berge cycles have diﬀerent behavior
with Berge paths, and we obtain the following bounds, similar to the ¨Ozkahya-Young result
[39] on matchings.

Proposition 1.7 For any ﬁxed integers s ≥ 4, k ≥ 3,

ex(n, s, Bk−1) + 2 ≤ ar(n, s, BCk−1) ≤ ex(n, s, Bk−1) + k.

The next section will be focused on introducing results on Tur´an numbers of paths and
cycles in hypergraphs, which are needed tools to derive our main results. A useful lemma
obtained from the stability results on Tur´an problems will be given in the next section as
well, which will be frequently used to ﬁnd certain desired paths in later proofs. The proof
of the main results will be presented in later sections.

2 Preliminaries

Note that the s-uniform Berge path B2 and loose path P2 are the same deﬁnitions, and
the determination of ex(n, s, P2) is trivial. In [20], F¨uredi, Jiang and Seiver determined
ex(n, s, Pk) for s ≥ 3.

Theorem 2.1 [20] Let s, t be positive integers with s ≥ 3. For suﬃciently large n, we
have

For P2t+1, the unique extremal family consists of all the s-subsets of [n] which meet some
ﬁxed set S of size t. For P2t+2, the unique extremal family consists of all the above edges
plus one additional s-set disjoint from S.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

The determination of ex(n, s, Pk) is nontrivial even for k = 2. Frankl [12] gave the value
of ex(n, s, P2) for s ≥ 4 and suﬃciently large n. Then Keevash, Mubayi and Wilson [32]
determined the value of ex(n, 4, P2) for all n. Note that when s = 3, ex(n, 3, P2) ≤ n, which
can be achieved when n is divisible by 4 by taking n/4 vertex disjoint copies of K (3)
(i.e.
the complete 3-graph on 4 vertices). For k ≥ 3, F¨uredi, Jiang and Seiver [20] provided the
exact Tur´an number of Pk for suﬃciently large n, where s ≥ 4, k ≥ 3. Kostochka, Mubayi
and Verstra¨ete [33] considered ex(n, s, Pk) for s ≥ 3, k ≥ 4 and suﬃciently large n. Later,
Jackowska, Polcyn and Ruci´nski [31] determined ex(n, 3, P3) for all n. We summarize those
results (only for the suﬃciently large n) as follows.

The unique extremal family for P2 consists of all the s-subsets of [n] containing some two
ﬁxed vertices for s ≥ 4. For P2t+1, the unique extremal family consists of all the s-subsets
of [n] which meet some ﬁxed set S of size t. For P2t+2, the unique extremal family consists
of all the above edges plus all the s-sets in [n]\S containing some two ﬁxed vertices not in
S.

For linear cycles, Frankl and F¨uredi [14] showed that the unique extremal n-vertex s-
graph (s ≥ 3) containing no C3 consists of all edges containing some ﬁxed vertex x, for
large enough n. For s = 3, Cs´ak´any and Kahn [7] obtained the same result for all n ≥ 6.

F¨uredi and Jiang [19], and Kostochka, Mubayi and Verstra¨ete [33] determined the Tur´an
number of Ck for all k ≥ 3, s ≥ 3 and suﬃciently large n as follows.

Theorem 2.3 [19, 33] Let s, t be positive integers with s ≥ 3. For suﬃciently large n, we

For C2t+1, the only extremal family consists of all the s-sets in [n] that meet some ﬁxed
t-set L. For C2t+2, the only extremal family consists of all the s-sets in [n] that intersect
some ﬁxed t-set L plus all the s-sets in [n] \ L that contain some two ﬁxed elements.

For the exceptional case of C4 in 3-uniform hypergraphs, Kostochka, Mubayi and Ver-

stra¨ete [33] showed that

The Tur´an number of a loose cycle was initially studied by Chv´atal [6]. Then Mubayi
for all s ≥ 3 and n ≥ 3s/2.
and Verstra¨ete [38] proved that ex (n, s, C3) =
F¨uredi and Jiang [19] determined ex (n, s, Ck) for k ≥ 3, s ≥ 4 and suﬃciently large n.
This conﬁrms (in a stronger form) a conjecture proposed by Mubayi and Verstra¨ete [37]
for k ≥ 3, s ≥ 4. Kostochka, Mubayi and Verstra¨ete [33] extended the results above and
determined ex (n, s, Ck) for all s ≥ 3 and large n. We summarize their results as follows.

For Tur´an number of a Berge cycle, Gy˝ori and Lemons proved that ex(n, 3, BC 2k+1) ≤
O(k4) · n1+1/k in [27] and ex(n, 3, BC2k+1) ≤ O(k2) · ex(n, C2k) in [26]. F¨uredi and ¨Ozkahya
[21] obtained better constant factors (depending on k). Further improvements were obtained
for even k by Gerbner, Methuku and Vizer [24], also by Gerbner, Methuku and Palmer
[23], and for odd k by Gerbner [22]. For s ≥ 4, Gy˝ori and Lemons [26] showed that
ex(n, s, BC2k+1) ≤ Os(ks−2) · ex(n, 3, BC2k+1) and ex(n, s, BC2k) ≤ Os(ks−1) · ex(n, C2k),
i.e., ex(n, s, BCk) = O(n1+1/⌊k/2⌋). The constant factors were improved by Jiang and Ma
[30], also for even k by Gerbner, Methuku and Vizer [24].

There are many other results on the Tur´an numbers of paths and cycles, in graphs
[2, 3, 34, 42] or hypergraphs [4, 21, 25]. The readers are referred to these references for
details.

The following stability result on linear paths and linear cycles will be needed in our

proofs. Let ∂H denote the (s − 1)-graph consisting of sets contained in some edge of H.

Theorem 2.5 [33] For ﬁxed s ≥ 3 and k ≥ 4, let ℓ =

[31] pointed out, the similar stability result holds for k = 3 and s = 3 as well. We rewrite
their results for k = 3 with the similar notations in Theorem 2.5 (in a slightly weaker form).

|H| ∼ t

H, where d is a ﬁxed constant. Then for suﬃciently large n, there are max{t − 1, 1} pairs
of (s − 1)-edges in G∗, say {ai, bi}, i = 1, . . . , t − 1, such that each of the following holds.

(iii) all these (s − 1)-edges are disjoint from W .

2. Suppose that there exists a 2-coloring of H without a rainbow P2. Then there must be
two edges e1 and e2 satisfying that the colors of e1 and e2 are diﬀerent and |e1 ∩ e2| > 1.
Let u ∈ e1 \ e2 and v ∈ e2 \ e1. Consider the edge e3 consisting of u, v and s − 2 vertices in
V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2). Since there is no rainbow P2, e3 can not be colored with either of the
two colors, a contradiction. So any 2-coloring of H admits a rainbow P2.

Denote by F the subgraph obtained by deleting e1 and e2 from G. If there is a linear
path P ′ of length two with edges f1 and f2 in F, let us say the colors of f1 and f2 are

β1 and β2, respectively. If f1 or f2 contains a f ree(P ) vertex w of e1 ∪ e2 and w is not
a cross(P ′) vertex in f1 ∪ f2, then the edge consisting of w and some s − 1 vertices in
V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ f1 ∪ f2), along with f1 and f2 form a rainbow P3. Suppose f1 ∪ f2
contains exactly one f ree(P ) vertex w of e1 ∪ e2 and w is the cross(P ′) vertex. Take an
edge e3 consisting of a f ree(P ) vertex x 6= w of e1, a f ree(P ′) vertex y of f1 and s − 2
vertices of V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ f1 ∪ f2), then the color of e3 is either α1 or α2. Hence the
path with edges e3, f1 and f2 is a rainbow P3. If f1 ∪ f2 contains no f ree(P ) vertex of
e1 ∪ e2, then the edge e4 formed by a f ree(P ) vertex x of e1, a f ree(P ′) vertex y of f1 and
s − 2 vertices of V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ f1 ∪ f2), must be colored with α1 or α2. So the path
with edges e4, f1 and f2 is a rainbow P3, a contradiction. Therefore, we can assume that

We divide our discussion into the following cases depending on the relationship between

vertices x, y and edges e1, e2.

Case 1. x, y /∈ e1 ∪ e2.

Consider the edge e consisting of x, y, a f ree(P ) vertex of e1 ∪ e2, and s − 3 vertices in
V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ {x, y}). Then, by the structure of F, we have e ∈ F, and thus e has a
diﬀerent color with α1 and α2. Therefore, we ﬁnd a rainbow P3 with edges e, e1 and e2 in
H.

Case 2. x ∈ e1 ∪ e2, y /∈ e1 ∪ e2, and x is not the cross(P ) vertex in e1 ∪ e2.

The edge e, which consists of x, y and s − 2 vertices in V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ {x, y}), has
a diﬀerent color with α1 and α2. Hence, e, e1, e2 form a rainbow P3 in H. Note that if
y ∈ e1 ∪ e2, x /∈ e1 ∪ e2, and y is not the cross(P ) vertex in e1 ∪ e2, we can also ﬁnd a
rainbow P3 in H similarly.

Case 3. x is a cross(P ) vertex in e1 ∪ e2, y /∈ e1 ∪ e2.

Let e be an edge with a f ree(P ) vertex in e1 and s−1 vertices in V (H)\V (e1∪e2∪{x, y}).
If e has color α2, then we have a rainbow P2 with edges e and e1. Similar to Case 2, we
can ﬁnd a rainbow P3 in H. So the color of e is α1. Pick an edge e′ consisting of x, y, a
vertex z in e \ e1 and s − 3 vertices in V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ {x, y, z}), then e, e′, e2 form a
rainbow P3 in H. And by symmetry, if y is a cross(P ) vertex in e1 ∪ e2 and x /∈ e1 ∪ e2, we
can ﬁnd a rainbow P3 in H as well.

Case 4. x ∈ e1 \ e2, y ∈ e2 \ e1.

Take an edge e consisting of a f ree(P ) vertex w 6= x in e1, and s − 1 vertices in
If the color of e is α1, then the edge e′
V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2), the color of e is α1 or α2.
consisting of w, x, y and s − 3 vertices of V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ e ∪ {x, y}), along with e and
e2 form a rainbow P3. If the color of e is α2, then the edge e′′ consisting of x, y and s − 2
vertices of V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ e ∪ {x, y}), along with e1 and e form a rainbow P3.

ar(n, s, P2) = 2 for n ≥ 3s − 4.

(iv). Let H be a complete s-uniform hypergraph on n vertices. Consider a 3-coloring
of H such that there is no rainbow P3 in H. Since ar(n, s, P2) = 2 < 3 by (iii), there is a
rainbow loose path P of length 2 with edges e1 and e2, colored by, say, α1 and α2. Suppose
that the number of f ree(P ) vertices in e1 is a, so the number of f ree(P ) vertices in e2 is
equal to a. Let

⌊s/2⌋

if s − a > ⌊s/2⌋,

s − a

if s − a ≤ ⌊s/2⌋.

p =




Assume that there is an edge f with color α3 /∈ {α1, α2} such that f ∩ (e1 ∪ e2) = ∅.
Consider an edge e consisting of all the f ree(P ) vertices in e1, p vertices in f , and s − a − p
vertices in V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ f ). Note that the color of e is either α1 or α2. If e is colored
with α2, then e1, e, f is a rainbow P3. So e can only be colored with α1. Similarly, let



⌈s/2⌉

if s − a > ⌈s/2⌉,

s − a

if s − a ≤ ⌈s/2⌉.

q =




Consider the edge e′ consisting of all the f ree(P ) vertices in e2, q vertices in V (f ) \ V (e),
and s − a − q vertices in V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ f ∪ e), then e′ is colored with α2. Thus, e, f, e′
is a rainbow P3.



So each of the edges colored with α3 contains vertices in e1 ∪ e2. Take an edge h with

color α3. Note that h ∩ e1 6= ∅ and h ∩ e2 6= ∅.

Case 1. Either e1 or e2 contains a f ree(P ) vertex not belonging to h.

Without loss of generality, suppose that there are b f ree(P ) vertices in e1 \ h, where b ≥
1. Take an edge e with b f ree(P ) vertices in e1 \h and s − b vertices in V (H)\V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ h).
Then e is colored with α1 or α2. If e is colored with α2, then e, e1, h form a rainbow P3.
So e is colored with α1. Then we have a rainbow P2 with edges h and e2, which are colored
with α3 and α2, respectively. And we have an edge e colored with α1 and e ∩ (h ∪ e2) = ∅.
It is the same situation as we analysed before, we can also ﬁnd a rainbow P3 in H.

Case 2. All the f ree(P ) vertices in e1 ∪ e2 belong to h.

Recall that there are a f ree(P ) vertices in e1. Take an edge e consisting of a f ree(P )
vertices in e1 and s − a vertices in V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ h). If e is colored with α2, then
we have a loose path P ′ of length two with edges e and e1, which are colored with α2
and α1, respectively, and e contains at least one f ree(P ′) vertex not belonging to h. It is
just similar to Case 1, in which we can ﬁnd a rainbow P3 in H. Thus e is colored with

11

α1. Similarly, take an edge e′ consisting of a f ree(P ) vertices in e2 and s − a vertices
V (H) \ V (e1 ∪ e2 ∪ h ∪ e), we can obtain that e′ is colored with α2. Now, there is a rainbow
P3 consisting of edges e, h and e′.

Therefore, ar(n, s, P3) ≤ 3, for n ≥ 4s − 3. Since ar(n, s, P3) ≥ 3 trivially holds, we

have that ar(n, s, P3) = 3 for n ≥ 4s − 3.

Since ar(n, s, B3) ≤ ar(n, s, P3), we obtain that ar(n, s, B3) = ar(n, s, P3) = 3 for

n ≥ 4s − 3.

We argue by contradiction and suppose that there is a coloring of H using D colors yielding
no rainbow Pk. Let G be a spanning subgraph of H with D edges such that each color
appears on exactly one edge of G. By Theorem 2.2, we obtain that there is a linear path
P of length k − 1 in G. Denote by e1, e2, . . . , ek−1 the edges of P , and α1, α2, . . . , αk−1 the
colors of e1, e2, . . . , ek−1, respectively.

Since H contains no rainbow Pk, we obtain the following fact.

Observation 4.1 Let v be a f ree(P ) vertex in e1 ∪ ek−1. Then for any edge g satisfying
g ∩ P = {v}, the edge g must be colored with a color of {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}.

Denote by F the subgraph obtained by deleting e1, e2, . . . , ek−1 from G. We divide the

remaining proof into two cases according to the parity of k.

4.1 Completing the proof when k = 2t is even

In this subsection, we assume that k = 2t ≥ 4 is even.

Claim 4.1 When k = 2t ≥ 4, there is no Pk−1 in F.

Proof. By contradiction, suppose there is a linear path P ′ of length k − 1 in F. Denote
the edges of P ′ by f1, f2, . . . , fk−1 with colors β1, β2, . . . , βk−1, respectively. Since there is
no rainbow Pk in H, every edge g with g ∩ V (P ′) = {u}, where u is a f ree(P ′) vertex in
f1 ∪ fk−1, must be colored with a color of {β1, β2, . . . , βk−1}. We obtain an s-graph Fe by
deleting f1, f2, . . . , fk−1 and all the edges containing at least two vertices of P ∪ P ′ from F.
Let c denote the number of vertices of P ∪ P ′. Then c ≤ 2[(k − 1)s − (k − 2)], and so we
have

|Fe| ≥ |F| − (k − 1) −

for suﬃciently large n. Thus, we have a linear path P ′′ of length k − 2 in Fe. Denote by
h1, h2, . . . , hk−2 the edges of P ′′. Moreover, every edge in P ′′ contains at most one vertex
from P ∪ P ′. So it follows from Observation 4.1 that P ′′ contains no f ree(P ) vertex of e1,
ek−1, and no f ree(P ′) vertex of f1, fk−1. Take an edge e consisting of a f ree(P ) vertex x
of e1, a f ree(P ′′) vertex of h1 \ V (P ∪ P ′) (since s ≥ 3, such vertex does exist), and s − 2
vertices in V (H) \ V (P ∪ P ′ ∪ P ′′), then e is colored with one color in {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}
by Observation 4.1. Take another edge e′ consisting of a f ree(P ′) vertex of f1 \ {x}, a
f ree(P ′′) vertex of hk−2 \ V (P ∪ P ′) and s − 2 vertices in V (H) \ (P ∪ P ′ ∪ P ′′ ∪ e), then
Observation 4.1 indicates e′ is colored with one color in {β1, β2, . . . , βk−1}. Hence the path
with edges e, h1, h2, . . . , hk−2, e′ is a rainbow Pk, a contradiction. This proves the claim. (cid:3)

e ∪ {v} ∈ F for any (s − 1)-edge e ∈ G∗ and any v ∈ L. Moreover, |F − L| = o(ns−1). We
point out that all the vertices of L are not f ree(P ) vertices in e1 ∪ ek−1. Otherwise, let W
be the vertex set of P . By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-edge disjoint with W in G∗,
and it gives an s-edge in F containing only a f ree(P ) vertex of P . This edge together with
P form a rainbow Pk, a contradiction.

Claim 4.2 When k = 2t ≥ 4, there is no edge in F − L.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary there exists an edge h ∈ F − L with color λ say. By Lemma
2.7, we can ﬁnd two (s−1)-edges a0, b0 in G∗, such that a0 and b0 have exactly one common
vertex u and are disjoint from P and h. Let W be the vertex set of P ∪ h ∪ a0 ∪ b0. By
Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1, such
that for every i, ai and bi have exactly one common vertex, and for any j 6= i, {ai, bi} and
{aj, bj} are vertex disjoint. Then,

f1 = a0 ∪ {v1}, f2 = {v1} ∪ a1, f3 = b1 ∪ {v2}, f4 = {v2} ∪ a2, f5 = b2 ∪ {v3},

. . . , fk−4 = {vt−2} ∪ at−2, fk−3 = bt−2 ∪ {vt−1}, fk−2 = {vt−1} ∪ at−1

form a Pk−2 in F, denoted by P ′. In the rest of the paper, this kind of path would be
abbreviated as

t−2

P ′ = a0

({vi} ⊕ ai ⊕ bi) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ at−1.

Mi=1

Let β1, β2, . . . , βk−2 be the colors of f1, f2, . . . , fk−2 respectively. Note that b0 ∪ {v1}
and bt−1 ∪ {vt−1} are edges of F, so both of them have colors distinct from any other edges
in F. The edges, which consist of one f ree(P ′) vertex in f1, one f ree(P ) vertex in e1 and
s−2 vertices disjoint with P and P ′, must be colored with colors from {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1} by
Observation 4.1. Let f be an edge consisting of the f ree(P ′) vertex u in f1, a vertex in h and
s − 2 vertices disjoint with P , P ′, b0 and h. Then the color of f is in {λ, β1, β2, . . . , βk−2},
because otherwise h ∪ f ∪ P ′ is a rainbow Pk. If the color of f is λ, then we can extend
f ∪ P ′ to a rainbow Pk with an additional edge, which containing one f ree(P ′) vertex in
fk−2 and a f ree(P ) vertex in ek−1.

Assume the color of f is βj for some j. Let W be the vertex set of f ∪ P ′ ∪ h ∪ b0.

We will derive the ﬁnal contradiction from the following claim.

Claim 4.3 When k = 2t ≥ 4, there exist at most one edge in P which is disjoint with L.

Proof. Suppose that there are two edges ei and ej (j > i) in P , which are disjoint with
L.
If j > i + 1, we ﬁnd an edge f in F containing a vertex in ei and disjoint with ej,
and an edge g in F containing a vertex in ej and disjoint with ei and f . Let f ∩ L = vp,
g ∩ L = vq. Without loss of generality, we suppose that vp = v1, vq = vt−1. Let W consist

Since P has k−1 edges, Claim 4.3 shows there are at least k−2 edges containing vertices
of L in P . As F = G − E(P ), we conclude that there are at least k − 2 edges containing
vertices in L which are not belonging to F, contradicting (3). This completes the proof for
even k.

4.2 Completing the proof when k = 2t + 1 is odd

In this subsection, we assume that k = 2t + 1 is odd.

Recall that F denotes the subgraph obtained from G by deleting e1, e2, . . . , ek−1.
If
there is no Pk−1 in F, then we can use Theorem 2.5 to characterize the structure of F.
However, this may not be the case when k is odd. Fortunately, we can prove that after
deleting a few edges, the remaining subgraph of F contains no Pk−1.

Claim 4.4 If there is a linear path P1 of length k − 1 in F, then F − E(P1) contains no
Pk−1.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that there is a linear path P2 of length k − 1 in F − E(P1).
Notice that the colors used in P1 and P2 are pairwise distinct by the selection of F. Let
f1, f2, . . . , fk−1 be the edges of P1 with colors β1, β2, . . . , βk−1, respectively, Denote by
g1, g2, . . . , gk−1 the edges of P2 with colors γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−1, respectively.

Let c denote the number of vertices of P ∪P1 ∪P2. Then we have c ≤ 3[(k −1)s−(k −2)].
Note that the number of edges which contain at least two vertices in P ∪ P1 ∪ P2 is at most

for suﬃciently large n, there exists a linear path P3 of length k − 3, such that every edge
in P3 has at most one vertex of P ∪ P1 ∪ P2. Hence, all the f ree(P ) vertices in e1 ∪ ek−1,
f ree(P1) vertices in f1 ∪fk−1 and f ree(P2) vertices in g1 ∪gk−1 are not in P3 by Observation
4.1. Denote by h1, h2, . . . , hk−3 the edges of P3. Consider an edge e, which consists of a
f ree(P ) vertex x in e1, a f ree(P3) vertex in h1 \ (P1 ∪ P2) and s − 2 vertices disjoint with
P ∪ P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3, it follows from Observation 4.1 that the color of e is in {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}.
And consider an edge e′, which consists of a f ree(P1) vertex y 6= x in f1 ∪ fk−1 (we can ﬁnd
such a vertex y since s > 3), a f ree(P3) vertex in hk−3 \ (P1 ∪ P2) and s − 2 vertices disjoint
with P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ P ∪ e, then the color of e′ is from {β1, β2, . . . , βk−1} by Observation 4.1.
Moreover, e ∪ P3 ∪ e′ is a rainbow Pk−1. Now consider another edge e′′, which consists of a
f ree(P2) vertex z 6= x, y in g1 ∪ gk−1, a vertex in e′ \ (P1 ∪ P3) and s − 2 vertices disjoint
with P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ P ∪ e ∪ e′, then e′′ has a color appeared in e ∪ P3 ∪ e′ by Observation
4.1. However, to prevent extending P2 to a rainbow Pk, the color of e′′ should be one of
(cid:3)
{γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−3}, a contradiction.

So if F has a Pk−1, denote by F0 the subgraph obtained by deleting all the k − 1 edges

of that Pk−1 in F. Then we have F0 is Pk−1-free by Claim 4.4 and

Now we focus on the edges which are disjoint with L, namely, the edges in (F ∪P )−L =
G − L and more generally, the edges in H − L. Considering the relationship between edges
in H − L, we make the following claim.

Claim 4.7 Assume that there exist three edges f, g, h in H − L with distinct colors such
that one of the following holds:
(i) f, g, h form a P3;
(ii) f, g form a P2, and h is disjoint with f ∪ g;
(iii) f, g, h are disjoint with each.
Then we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H.

Proof. Notice that for each e ∈ {f, g, h}, there is a unique edge e′ in G having the same
color with e. So we denote f ′, g′, h′ to be the edges in G with the same color with f, g, h,
respectively. If the edge e is in G for some e ∈ {f, g, h}, we have e′ = e.

(i) Assume that there are three edges f, g, h in H − L with distinct colors such that
f, g, h form a P3. Realize that in G∗, there exists an (s − 1)-edge a0 containing a vertex x

As H is a counterexample which contains no rainbow Pk, we know that each of the

by Claim 4.7. In fact, if there are more than two edges in P − L, then one of conditions
(i), (ii), (iii) in Claim 4.7 must occur. On the other hand, since |L| = t − 1, there are at

We shall derive the ﬁnal contradiction depending on F − L contains a P2 or not.

Case A. F − L contains a P2.

We take such a P2 in F − L and denote its edges by h1 and h2 with colors γ1 and γ2,
respectively. Select an edge e in H − L such that e is disjoint with {ei, ej, h1, h2}. If the
color of e is αi or αj, then h1, h2 form a P2 and e is disjoint with them, which satisﬁes
condition (ii) of Claim 4.7, and so we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H. Assume instead that the
color of e is not in {αi, αj}, then e, ei, ej have distinct colors. Furthermore, either e, ei, ej
are pairwise disjoint, or ei, ej form a P2 and e is disjoint with them. This satisﬁes one of
the conditions (ii) and (iii) of Claim 4.7, which we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H.

Case B. F − L does not contain a P2.

edges containing two ﬁxed vertices x and y. Note
Namely, F − L consists of all the

select an edge h in F − L such that h intersects ei ∪ ej as small as possible. Since F − L
edges containing x and y, we have that h intersects ei ∪ ej in at

most two vertices, namely, some of x and y. Then ei, ej , h must satisfy one of the conditions
(i), (ii) and (iii) in Claim 4.7, which we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H. Assume instead that
ei, ej are consecutive in P in the following.

(cid:1)

If either x ∈ ei \ ej, y ∈ ej \ ei or ei ∩ ej ∈ {x, y}, then we can select an edge h in
F − L such that h ∩ ({ei, ej} \ {x, y}) = ∅. Take an edge e in H such that e is disjoint with
{ei, ej, h} and L. If the color of e is αi or αj, then ej, h form a rainbow P2 and e is disjoint
with them, or ei, h form a rainbow P2 and e is disjoint with them. Thus e, ej, h or e, ei, h
satisfy condition (ii) of Claim 4.7, which we can obtain a rainbow Pk in H. If the color of
e is neither αi nor αj, then e, ei, ej have distinct colors. Moreover, ei, ej form a P2 and e
is disjoint with them. This shows e, ei, ej satisfy condition (ii) of Claim 4.7, which we can
ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H.

Finally, assume instead that either {x, y} ∩ {ei, ej} = ∅, or x ∈ ei \ ej, y /∈ ej. Then
we select an edge h in F − L such that h intersects ei ∪ ej as small as possible. Thus h
intersects ei ∪ ej in at most one vertex, namely x, which is a free vertex in ei ∪ ej. This
indicates ei, ej, h satisfy one of the conditions (i) and (ii) of Claim 4.7, and hence we can
ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H.

Therefore, we have established the upper bound.

5 Loose Path–Proof of Theorem 1.3

Let H be a complete s-uniform hypergraph on n vertices. The lower bound in Theorem
1.3 follows from a similar construction in Theorem 1.2 by applying the extreme s-graphs
obtained from Theorem 2.1.

If k = 2t + 1, we consider, by contradiction, a coloring of H using
colors yielding no rainbow Pk. Let G be a spanning subgraph of H with
+ 3
edges such that each color appears on exactly one edge of G. By Theorem 2.2, we obtain
that there is a loose path P of length k − 1 in G. Denote by e1, e2, . . . , ek−1 the edges of P ,
and α1, α2, . . . , αk−1 the colors of e1, e2, . . . , ek−1, respectively.

Denote by F the subgraph obtained by deleting e1, e2, . . . , ek−1 from G. Similar to the
proof of Theorem 1.2, we show that after deleting few edges from F, the remaining subgraph
contains no Pk−1. Actually, we prove something stronger. Call a loose path P ′ bad, if the
number of f ree(P ′) vertices in the two end edges of P ′ is at least three. Since s ≥ 3, it is
easy to get that a linear path is also a bad loose path.

Claim 5.1 There are no edge-disjoint bad loose paths of length k − 1 in F.

Proof. By contradiction, suppose that there are two edge-disjoint bad loose paths P1 and P2
of length k − 1 in F. Denote by f1, f2, . . . , fk−1 the edges of P1 with colors β1, β2, . . . , βk−1,
respectively. And denote by g1, g2, . . . , gk−1 the edges of P2 with colors γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−1,
respectively. Let c denote the number of vertices of P ∪P1∪P2. Then c ≤ 3[(k−1)s−(k−2)].

for suﬃciently large n, there exists a linear path P3 of length k − 3, such that every edge in
P3 has at most one vertex of P ∪ P1 ∪ P2. Hence, for the same reason as in Observation 4.1,
all the f ree(P ) vertices in e1 ∪ ek−1, f ree(P1) vertices in f1 ∪ fk−1 and f ree(P2) vertices
in g1 ∪ gk−1 are not in P3. Denote by h1, h2, . . . , hk−3 the edges of P3. Consider the edge
e, which consists of a f ree(P ) vertex x in e1, a f ree(P3) vertex in h1 \ (P1 ∪ P2) and s − 2
vertices disjoint with P ∪ P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3. Then the color of e must be from {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}.
And consider the edge e′, which consists of a f ree(P1) vertex y 6= x in f1 ∪ fk−1 (we can
ﬁnd such a vertex y since P1 is bad), a f ree(P3) vertex in hk−3 \ (P1 ∪ P2) and s − 2 vertices
disjoint with P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ P ∪ e, then the color of e′ is from {β1, β2, . . . , βk−1}. Moreover,
e ∪ P3 ∪ e′ is a rainbow Pk−1. Now consider another edge e′′, which consists of a f ree(P2)
vertex z 6= x, y in g1 ∪ gk−1, a vertex in e′ \ (P1 ∪ P3) and s − 2 vertices disjoint with

21

P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ P ∪ e ∪ e′, then e′′ must have a color appeared in the rainbow loose path
e ∪ P3 ∪ e′. However, to avoid extending P2 to a rainbow Pk, the color of e′′ should be one of
{γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−3}, a contradiction. Therefore, F contains no edge-disjoint bad loose paths
(cid:3)
of length k − 1.

So if F has a bad Pk−1, denote by F0 the subgraph obtained by deleting all the k − 1
edges of that Pk−1 in F; if F dose not contain a bad Pk−1, then we delete any k − 1 edges
of it and denote the subgraph remained by F0. Then in either case,

F0 contains no bad Pk−1.

, by Theorem 2.5, we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-graph G∗ ⊂ ∂F0
with |G∗| ∼
and a set L of t−1 vertices of F0 such that L∩V (G∗) = ∅ and e∪{v} ∈ F0
for any (s − 1)-edge e ∈ G∗ and any v ∈ L. Moreover, |F0 − L| = o(ns−1). Select a G∗ with
the maximum number of (s − 1)-edges. Let the vertices in L be v1, v2, . . . , vt−1. Note that
all the vi for i = 1, 2, . . . , t − 1 are not f ree(P ) vertices in e1 ∪ ek−1. Otherwise, let W be
the vertex set of P , by Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-edge disjoint with W in G∗, and
then this together with vi will form an s-edge which extends P to a rainbow Pk.

(cid:1)

We divide the edges of F0 − L into two types. Let Q denote the set of f ree(P ) vertices
in e1 ∪ ek−1. For an edge e ∈ F0 − L, we call it of Type I if Q ⊆ e, and of Type II otherwise.
Now we estimate the number of edges of each type.

Claim 5.2 There is no P2 in F0 − L whose edges are all of Type II. Therefore, the number
of edges of Type II is at most ⌊n/s⌋.

Proof. Suppose that there is a P2 with two edges of Type II in F0 − L, whose edges are
denoted by h1 and h2 with colors γ1 and γ2, respectively. We can take (s − 1)-edges a0,
b0 in G∗, such that a0 and b0 have exactly one common vertex u and are disjoint from P ,
h1 and h2. Let W be the vertex set of P ∪ h1 ∪ h2 ∪ a0 ∪ b0. By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd
(s − 1)-edges {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1, such that for every i, ai and bi
have exactly one common vertex, and for any j 6= i, {ai, bi} and {aj, bj} are vertex disjoint.
Then,

t−2

P ′ = a0

({vi} ⊕ ai ⊕ bi) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ at−1

is a P2t−2 = Pk−3. Let the edges of P ′ be f1, f2, . . . , fk−3, and the colors of edges be
β1, β2, . . . , βk−3 respectively.

Mi=1

Consider an edge g, which consists of a vertex in h2 \ h1, the common vertex u of a0
and b0, and s − 2 vertices disjoint from P , P ′, h1, h2, b0 and bt−1. So to prevent extending
P ′ to a rainbow Pk, the color of g is in {γ1, γ2, β1, β2, . . . , βk−3}. If the color of g is γ1,
consider the edge e, which consists of a vertex in Q \ h2, a vertex in at−1 and s − 2 vertices

22

disjoint from P , P ′, h1, h2, g, b0 and bt−1, then the color of e is from {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1},
and hence h2 ∪ g ∪ P ′ ∪ e is a rainbow Pk.

If the color of g is γ2, we pick a vertex w in h1, such that if |Q| < s, let w ∈ h1 \ Q,
and if |Q| ≥ s, let w be an arbitrary vertex in h1. Consider the edge e′ consisting of w, the
common vertex of at−1 and bt−1, and s − 2 vertices disjoint from P , P ′, h1, h2, g, b0 and
bt−1. Then the color of e′ is from {γ1, γ2, β1, β2, . . . , βk−3}, because otherwise, g ∪P ′ ∪e′ ∪h1
is a rainbow Pk. If the color of e′ is γ2, then h1 ∪ e′ ∪ P ′ is a rainbow Pk−1. We obtain a
rainbow Pk by adding an edge e′′, which consists of a vertex in Q \ h1, a f ree(P ′) vertex in
f1 \ {u} and s − 2 vertices disjoint from P , P ′, h1, h2, g, e′, b0 and bt−1. If the color of e′ is
γ1, consider the edge e′′′ consisting of a vertex in Q \ (g ∪ e′), a vertex in g \ (h2 ∪ {u}) and
s − 2 vertices disjoint from P , P ′, h1, h2, g, e′, b0 and bt−1. Then the color of e′′′ is from
{α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}, and hence e′′′ ∪ g ∪ P ′ ∪ e′ is a rainbow Pk. If the color of e′ is βj for
some j. Let W be the vertex set of h1 ∪ h2 ∪ e′ ∪ a0 ∪ b0 ∪ at−1 ∪ bt−1 ∪ g, by Lemma 2.7,

So assume instead the color of g is one of {β1, β2, . . . , βk−3}. Let W be the vertex set

of h1 ∪ h2 ∪ b0 ∪ bt−1 ∪ g. By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges {a′′

Claim 5.2.

Now, we move to Type I edges. Recall that Q denotes the set of f ree(P ) vertices in
e1 ∪ek−1. So if s ≤ |Q| ≤ 2(s−1), the number of Type I edges is at most 1; if 2 ≤ |Q| ≤ s−1,
.
then a rough counting shows the number of Type I edges is at most
We further prove that there is no isolated vertex in F0. Indeed, if F0 has an isolated vertex,

In fact, to ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H, we can make use of the suitable edges in F0 − L and
P − L to extend a Pk−3. We shall prove the following claim, which is analogous to Claim
4.7.

Claim 5.4 (i) For k ≥ 7, if there are three edges f, g, h in H − L with distinct colors such
that f, g, h form a P3, or f, g form a P2 and h is disjoint with f ∪ g, or f, g, h are disjoint
with each other, then we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H.

(ii) For k = 5, if there exists either a rainbow P3 or a P2 plus a disjoint edge with all

three edges having distinct colors in H − L, then we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H.

Proof. Similar to the proof of Claim 4.7, we denote f ′, g′, h′ to be the edges in G with the
same color of f, g, h, respectively. If the edge e is in G for some e ∈ {f, g, h}, we have e′ = e.

(i) Let k ≥ 7. Suppose that there are three edges f, g, h in H − L with distinct colors
such that f, g, h form a P3. In G∗, there exists an (s − 1)-edge a0 containing a vertex x
in h \ g and disjoint with (f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ f ∪ g ∪ h) \ {x}. Let W consist of the vertices in
f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ f ∪ g ∪ h ∪ a0. By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges {ai, bi} disjoint from
W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1. Then,

t−2

f ⊕ g ⊕ h ⊕ a0

({vi} ⊕ ai ⊕ bi) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ at−1

is a rainbow Pk in H.

If f, g form a P2, h is disjoint with f ∪g. In G∗, there exists an (s−1)-edge a0 containing
a vertex x in g \ f and disjoint with (f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ g ∪ h ∪ f ) \ {x}. And there exists an
(s − 1)-edge b0 containing a vertex y in h and disjoint with (f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ f ∪ g ∪ h ∪ a0) \ {y}.
Let W consist of the vertices in f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ f ∪ g ∪ h ∪ a0 ∪ b0. By Lemma 2.7, we can
ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1. Then,

And we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges a′
0 contains a vertex y1 in g and
disjoint with (f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ f ∪ g ∪ h ∪ a0) \ {y1}, b′
0 contains a vertex y2 6= y1 in g and

b0 containing a vertex z in h and disjoint with (f ′ ∪ g′ ∪ h′ ∪ f ∪ g ∪ h ∪ a0 ∪ a′

(ii) For k = 5, the proof is identical to (i), and thus omitted.

(cid:3)

Actually, in P , there are at most 2(t − 1) edges containing vertices of L, so we can ﬁnd
at least 2 edges in P − L. However, there are not three edges of P satisfying the condition
described in Claim 5.4, and so we derive that there are exactly two edges in P − L.

Case A. k ≥ 7.

If |F0 − L| > 0, then the two edges in P − L must be consecutive by Claim 5.4. Let ei
and ei+1 be such two edges. We take an edge h ∈ F0 − L, then select an edge g ∈ H − L,
such that g is disjoint with P and h. If the color of g is αj for some j, then either the color
of g is diﬀerent with ei or diﬀerent with ei+1. Suppose the colors of g and ei are diﬀerent,
then we have three edges ei, g, h satisfying the condition of Claim 5.4, and so we can ﬁnd a
rainbow Pk in H. If the color of g is diﬀerent with both ei and ei+1, then the three edges
ei, ei+1 and g satisfy condition of Claim 5.4, which we can ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H similarly.

Assume instead that |F0 − L| = 0. Then all the

+ 3 − 2(k − 1) edges in
F0 contain vertices in L, and P has k − 3 edges containing vertices in L. Since the number
n
of edges containing vertices of L is at most
, in F \ F0 there are at most k − 2
s
edges containing vertices in L. Since |F \ F0| = k − 1, there is an edge f in F \ F0 such that

same proof to the case that |F0 − L| > 0, by replacing the edge h ∈ F0 − L with f , we can
ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H as well.

Case B. k = 5.

As noticed above, there are exactly two edges, say ei and ej, in P − L.

If |F0 − L| = 0, then all the

+ 3 − 2(k − 1) edges in F0 contain vertices in
L. Also P has k − 3 edges containing vertices in L. Since the number of edges containing
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
vertices of L is at most
, in F \ F0 there are at most k − 2 edges containing
vertices in L. Since |F \ F0| = k − 1, there is an edge h in F \ F0 such that h ∩ L = ∅. Then
the color of h is diﬀerent with any other edges in F, and diﬀerent with the colors appeared
in P . If |F0 − L| > 0, then there exists an edge f1 ∈ F0 − L. We set f to be an edge such
that f = h if |F0 − L| = 0 and f = f1 ∈ F0 − L if |F0 − L| > 0. Then by Claim 5.4, f
satisﬁes that

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

either f ∩ ei = ∅, f ∩ ej = ∅ or

f ∩ ei 6= ∅, f ∩ ej 6= ∅.

(6)

For the former case of (6), pick an edge g ∈ H − L, such that g ∩ ei 6= ∅, g ∩ f 6= ∅ and
g is disjoint with ej. Consider the color of g. If the color of g is αi, then the three edges
ej, g, f are applied for Claim 5.4; if the color of g is αj, then the three edges ei, g, f are
applied for Claim 5.4; if the color of g is diﬀerent with both αi and αj, then the three edges
ei, ej, g are applied for Claim 5.4. Therefore, we can always ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in this case.

For the latter case of (6) that f ∩ ei 6= ∅ and f ∩ ej 6= ∅, we must have ei and ej are
consecutive in P by Claim 5.4. Let g be an edge in H − L such that g is disjoint with ei, ej
and f . If the color of g is αi or αj, then the three edges f , ej, g, or the three edges f , ei,
g are applied for Claim 5.4. If the color of g is neither αi nor αj, then the three edges ei,
ej, g are applied for Claim 5.4, and so we can still ﬁnd a rainbow Pk in H. This completes
the proof of Theorem 1.3.

of H using g(n, s, k) colors yielding no rainbow Ck. Since g(n, s, k) = ar(n, s, Pk) and by
Theorem 1.2, there is a rainbow linear path P of length k in H. Let G be a spanning

Claim 6.1 When k = 2t+1, if there is a linear path P1 of length k−1 in F, then F −E(P1)

that there is a linear path P2 of length k − 1 in F − E(P1). Denote the edges of P1 by
f1, f2, . . . , fk−1, and the edges of P2 by g1, g2, . . . , gk−1, respectively. We obtain an s-graph
F ′ by deleting edge set E(P1) ∪ E(P2) and all the edges containing at least two vertices of

for suﬃciently large n. Thus, we have a linear path P3 of length k − 3 in F ′. Denote by

(V (P ) ∪ V (P1) ∪ V (P2)). Since s − 1 ≥ k − 3 + 5 and every path has two disjoint end edges,
we can always choose distinct vertices v1, v2, . . . , v6 such that the following holds: v1 ∈ e1
and v2 ∈ ek−1 are f ree(P ) vertices, v3 ∈ f1 and v4 ∈ fk−1 are f ree(P1) vertices, v5 ∈ g1

e′ has a color appeared in

Similarly, the edge e′′, which consists of v3, v4, a vertex x in e′ \{v1, v2, u1} and s−3 vertices

disjoint with P ∪ P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ e′, is colored with a color appeared on P1. In addition,
consider the edge e′′′, which consists of v5, v6, u2, a vertex in e′′ \{v3, v4, x} and s−4 vertices
disjoint with P ∪ P1 ∪ P2 ∪ P3 ∪ e′ ∪ e′′. We get that e′′′ is colored with a color appeared on
P2. Now it follows that P3 ∪ e′ ∪ e′′ ∪ e′′′ forms a rainbow Ck, a contradiction. This proves

the claim.

So when k = 2t + 1, if F has a Pk−1, then we denote by F0 the subgraph obtained by
deleting all the k − 1 edges of that Pk−1 from F, and so F0 is Pk−1-free by Claim 6.1. If

27

there is no Pk−1 in F, we delete any k − 1 edges of F, and denote the subgraph remained
by F0. When k = 2t, we obtain F0 by deleting any k − 1 edges from F. In any case, we
obtain a subgraph F0 with |F0| = |F| − [(k − 1)s − (k − 2)] ∼ (t − 1)
. Moreover, F0
is Ck-free for k = 2t, and F0 is Pk−1-free for k = 2t + 1. Thus we can apply Theorem 2.5
to F0 whenever k is even or odd. By Theorem 2.5, we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-graph G∗ ⊂ ∂F0

An s-edge e is called a missing-edge if e contains vertices of L and e /∈ F0. Let M be

We start to prove claims below similar to Claims 4.3, 4.6 and 4.7.

Claim 6.2 Every vertex v ∈ V \ L belongs to G∗. Moreover, for any vertex subset S of V
with |S| ≤ 8s and v /∈ S, there is an (s − 1)-edge g ∈ G∗ such that v ∈ g and g is disjoint
with S.

Claim 6.3 (a) If k = 2t ≥ 8, then there are no two edges e, f in G −L, such that |e∩f | = 1
or e ∩ f = ∅.

(b) If k = 2t + 1 ≥ 11, then there are no three edges e, f, h in G − L satisfying one of

the following conditions:
(i) e, f, h form a P3;
(ii) e, f form a P2, and h is disjoint with e ∪ f ;
(iii) e, f, h are pairwise disjoint.

Proof. (a) Let k = 2t. Suppose to the contrary that there exist two edges e, f in G − L
such that |e ∩ f | = 1. Let u ∈ e \ f , v ∈ f \ e. By Claim 6.2, u, v ∈ V (G∗) and we can
ﬁnd an (s − 1)-edge a0 in G∗ such that u ∈ a0 and a0 is disjoint with e ∪ f \ {u}. Applying
Claim 6.2 again, there is an (s − 1)-edge b0 in G∗ such that v ∈ b0 and b0 is disjoint with
(e ∪ f ∪ a0) \ {v}. Let W be the vertex set of e ∪ f ∪ a0 ∪ b0. By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd
(s − 1)-edge pairs {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1, such that for every i, ai and bi
have exactly one common vertex, and for any j 6= i, {ai, bi} and {aj, bj} are vertex disjoint.
Then

t−2

P ′ = a0

({vi} ⊕ ai ⊕ bi) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ b0

is a Pk−2 in F0. Adding e, f to P ′, we obtain a rainbow Ck, which is a contradiction.

Mi=1

Assume, by contradiction, that there are two edges e, f in G − L such that e ∩ f = ∅.
Select four distinct vertices x, y, z, w such that x, y ∈ e and z, w ∈ f . By Claim 6.2, we can
ﬁnd an (s − 1)-edge a in G∗ such that x ∈ a and a is disjoint with (e ∪ f ) \ {x}. Applying
Claim 6.2 repeatedly, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges b, a′, b′ one by one in G∗ such that y ∈ b and
b is disjoint with (e \ {y}) ∪ f ∪ a; z ∈ a′ and a′ is disjoint with e ∪ (f \ {z}) ∪ a ∪ b; w ∈ b′
and b′ is disjoint with e∪ (f \{w})∪ a∪ b∪ a′. Let W be the vertex set of e∪ f ∪ a∪ b∪ a′ ∪ b′.
By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edge pairs {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1.
Then

P ′ = e ⊕ b ⊕ {v1} ⊕ a′ ⊕ f

is a P4 in G, and

t−2

P ′′ = a

({vi} ⊕ ai−1 ⊕ bi−1) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ b′

is a Pk−4 in F0. Furthermore, P ′ ∪ P ′′ forms a rainbow Ck, a contradiction. This proves
(a).

Mi=2

(b) Let k = 2t + 1. We shall derive a contradiction by assuming one of conditions

(i)(ii)(iii) holds.

(i) Assume that there is a linear path P1 with three consecutive edges e, f, h in G − L.
Take two f ree(P1) vertices u, v such that u ∈ e and v ∈ h. By Claim 6.2, u, v ∈ V (G∗)
and we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-edge a0 in G∗ such that u ∈ a0 and a0 is disjoint with (e \

29

{u}) ∪ f ∪ h. Also, there is an (s − 1)-edge b0 in G∗ such that v ∈ b0 and b0 is disjoint with
e ∪ f ∪ (h \ {v}) ∪ a0. Let W be the vertex set of e ∪ f ∪ h ∪ a0 ∪ b0. By Lemma 2.7, we can
ﬁnd (s − 1)-edge pairs {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1. Then

t−2

a0

({vi} ⊕ ai ⊕ bi) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ b0

Mi=1

is a Pk−3 in F0. Adding e, f, h to that Pk−3, it results a rainbow Ck, a contradiction.

(ii) Suppose there are three edges e, f, h in G − L, satisfying that e, f form a P2 and h
is disjoint with e ∪ f . Take four distinct vertices x, y, z, w such that x ∈ e \ f , y ∈ f \ e,
and z, w ∈ h. By Claim 6.2, we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-edge a in G∗ such that x ∈ a and a is
disjoint with (e \ {x}) ∪ f ∪ h. Applying Claim 6.2 repeatedly, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges b,
a′, b′ in G∗ such that y ∈ b and b is disjoint with e ∪ (f \ {y}) ∪ a ∪ h; z ∈ a′ and a′ is disjoint
with e ∪ f ∪ (h \ {z}) ∪ a ∪ b; w ∈ b′ and b′ is disjoint with e ∪ f ∪ (h \ {w}) ∪ a ∪ b ∪ a′. Let
W be the vertex set of e ∪ f ∪ h ∪ a ∪ b ∪ a′ ∪ b′. By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edge
pairs {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1. Then

P ′ = e ⊕ f ⊕ b ⊕ {v1} ⊕ a′ ⊕ h

is a P5 in G, and

t−2

P ′′ = a

({vi} ⊕ ai−1 ⊕ bi−1) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ b′

Mi=2
is a Pk−5 in F0. Thus P ′ ∪ P ′′ is a rainbow Ck, a contradiction.

(iii) Suppose that there are three pairwise disjoint edges e, f, h in G − L. Take distinct
vertices x, y, z, w, u, v such that x, y ∈ e, z, w ∈ f , and u, v ∈ h . By applying Claim 6.2
repeatedly, we can ﬁnd (s−1)-edges a, b, a′, b′, a′′, b′′ in G∗ such that x ∈ a and a is disjoint
with (e \ {x}) ∪ f ∪ h; y ∈ b and b is disjoint with (e \ {y}) ∪ f ∪ h ∪ a; z ∈ a′ and a′ is disjoint
with e ∪ (f \ {z}) ∪ h ∪ a ∪ b; w ∈ b′ and b′ is disjoint with e ∪ (f \ {w}) ∪ h ∪ a ∪ b ∪ a′;
u ∈ a′′ and a′′ is disjoint with e ∪ f ∪ (h \ {u}) ∪ a ∪ b ∪ a′ ∪ b′; v ∈ b′′ and b′′ is disjoint with
e ∪ f ∪ (h \ {v}) ∪ a ∪ b ∪ a′ ∪ b′ ∪ a′′. Note that the size of vertex set S in applying Claim
6.2 is at most 8s as required. Let W be the vertex set of e ∪ f ∪ h ∪ a ∪ b ∪ a′ ∪ b′ ∪ a′′ ∪ b′′.
By Lemma 2.7, we can ﬁnd (s − 1)-edges {ai, bi} disjoint from W for i = 1, . . . , t − 1. Then

P ′ = e ⊕ b ⊕ {v1} ⊕ a′ ⊕ f ⊕ b′ ⊕ {v2} ⊕ a′′ ⊕ h

is a P7 in G, and

t−2

P ′′ = a

({vi} ⊕ ai−1 ⊕ bi−1) ⊕ {vt−1} ⊕ b′′

is a Pk−7 in F0. Therefore, P ′ ∪ P ′′ is a rainbow Ck, a contradiction. This completes the
(cid:3)
proof of Claim 6.3.

Mi=3

With the aid of Theorem 1.2, it is ready to ﬁnish the proof of this case now. Recall that
P is a linear path of length k in H. Since there are at most 2(t − 1) edges meeting L in P ,

30

we have that there are at least 2 edges in P − L ⊂ G − L when k = 2t, and at least 3 edges
in P − L when k = 2t + 1. Hence we obtain edges satisfying the conditions of Claim 6.3,
which is a contradiction.

(cid:1)

n−8s−t+1

(cid:0)

In this subsection, we assume that m >

− 1 to complete the proof. In this
case, the edges meeting L in F0 may not be enough to make similar arguments as Claim
(cid:0)
6.2, and it seems that we can not use Lemma 2.7 directly to ﬁnd a rainbow Ck as before.
Our new strategy is to search a dense structure playing similar role as Lemma 2.7, which
is motivated by some ideas in [33]. The key ingredient is to ﬁnd some (s − 2)-sets of V
such that each of them can form rainbow edges with every vertex in L and a large number
of other vertices. We shall eventually use these substructures to establish certain desired
paths or cycles.

(cid:1)

For any vertex set Z of a hypergraph H, the degree of Z in H, denoted by dH (Z), is

the number of edges containing the entire set Z in H.

In the following, we denote K = 2s + k − 3 for convenience.

Claim 6.4 There are K pairwise disjoint (s − 2)-sets Ti (i = 1, . . . , K) in V \ L, such that
for every i ∈ [K] and j ∈ [t − 1] we have

dF0(Ti ∪ {vj}) ≥ n − s + 1 −

k(s − 1)m
n−t+1
s−2

.

Proof. For any i ∈ [K] and j ∈ [t − 1], let dF0 (Ti ∪ {vj}) denote the number of s-sets e such
that Ti ∪ {vj} ⊂ e, but e /∈ F0. That is the number of missing-edges containing Ti ∪ {vj}.
Thus we have dF0(Ti ∪ {vj}) + dF0(Ti ∪ {vj}) = n − s + 1.

Consider an (s − 2)-set R of V \ L selected uniformly randomly from all (s − 2)-sets of

Claim 6.6 (1) If k = 2t, then there are no two edges e, f ∈ (F0 − L) ∪ J such that e, f
form a rainbow P2 with |(f \ e) ∩ U | ≥ 1 and |(e \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1.
(2) If k = 2t + 1, then there are no two edges e, f ∈ F0 − L such that e, f form a P2, with
|(f \ e) ∩ U | ≥ 1 or |(e \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1.

Proof. (1) For k = 2t, if there are two edges e, f ∈ (F0 −L)∪J such that e, f form a rainbow
P2 with |(f \ e) ∩ U | ≥ 1 and |(e \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1. Let x ∈ (f \ e) ∩ U and y ∈ (e \ f ) ∩ U .
Since T is disjoint with U , there are at most (2s − 3) such Ti’s that contain vertices of
e or f . Hence, there are at least K − (2s − 3) = k > k − 2 such Ti’s that are disjoint
with e and f . Suppose, without loss of generality, that Ti is disjoint with e and f for each
i ∈ [k − 2]. Then by the deﬁnitions of T and U , there is a rainbow Pk−2 in F0 with edges
h1, h2, . . . , hk−2, such that

h1 = {x} ∪ T1 ∪ {v1}, h2 = {v1} ∪ T2 ∪ {u1}, h3 = {u1} ∪ T3 ∪ {v2},

. . . , hk−3 = {ut−2} ∪ Tk−3 ∪ {vt−1}, hk−2 = {vt−1} ∪ Tk−2 ∪ {y},

where u1, . . . , ut−2 are distinct vertices selected in U \ (e ∪ f ). Adding edges e, f to that
Pk−2, we obtain a rainbow Ck, a contradiction.

(2) For k = 2t + 1, suppose to the contrary that there are edges e, f ∈ F0 − L such that
|e ∩ f | = 1 and x ∈ (f \ e) ∩ U . As there are at most (2s − 2) Ti’s containing vertices of e or
f , we obtain that there are at least K − (2s − 2) = k − 1 > k − 3 such Ti’s that are disjoint
with e and f . Without loss of generality, assume that for i ∈ [k − 3], Ti is disjoint with e
and f . Then there is a Pk−3 with the ﬁrst edge containing x, and all the k − 3 edges are of
the form Ti ∪ {vj, uℓ} similar as above, where i ∈ [k − 3], j ∈ [t − 1] and uℓ ∈ U . Adding
edges e, f to that Pk−3, we obtain a Pk−1 in F0, a contradiction to Claim 6.1 that F0 is
(cid:3)
Pk−1-free for k = 2t + 1.

Now we treat the edges of F0 − L in details. For 0 ≤ i ≤ s, let

B(i) = {e ∈ F0 − L :

|e ∩ U | = i},

and let B(2+) = B(2) ∪ B(3) ∪ . . . ∪ B(s).

By Eq.(8), we have m < ǫ(n − t − s)s−1 < ǫns−1 for every ﬁxed positive constant ǫ when
n is suﬃciently large. Let δ = 8(t + 1) [2Kk(t − 1) · (s − 1)!]s ǫs−2. Here we set the constant
δ to satisfy 0.5 < δ < 1 by selecting an appropriate small constant ǫ > 0.

As a consequence of Claim 6.5, we show the following inequality holds:

4 m < m

4 . In particular, if m = O(ns−2), then |B(0)| ≤ O(1).

2 . In particular, if m = O(ns−2), then |B(1)| ≤ O(n).

Proof. (a) Since the edges in B(0) can not form a Ck, by Eq.(9), we have

and h ⊂ e. We divide Q into two sets Q1 and Q2, such that for every h ∈ Q1 there is only
one vertex u ∈ U satisfying h ∪ {u} ∈ B(1), and Q2 = Q \ Q1. Hence we have

|B(1)| < |Q1| + |Q2|n.

Clearly, |Q1| ≤

4 m < m

To bound |Q2|, notice that there are no h1, h2 ∈ Q2 such that |h1 ∩ h2| = 1. Otherwise,
we obtain two s-edges e, f ∈ F0 − L containing h1, h2, respectively, where e, f form a

rainbow P2 with |(f \ e) ∩ U | = 1 and |(e \ f ) ∩ U | = 1. This contradicts to Claim 6.6. Thus
we have

|B(2+)| = |B(2) ∪ B(3) ∪ . . . ∪ B(s)| = |F0 − L| − |B(0)| − |B(1)|.

(10)

Next, we explore properties of |B(2+)| and m.

Claim 6.8 (a) We have |B(2+)| ≤ ex(n − t + 1, s, P2) =
(b) We must have k = 2t and m = O(ns−2). In fact, we have m < 4

(s−2)! ns−2.

Proof. (a) If |B(2+)| > ex(n − t + 1, s, P2), then there is a P2 with two edges e, f ∈ B(2+).
Moreover, by deﬁnition of B(2+), we have |(f \ e) ∩ U | ≥ 1 and |(e \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1, a
contradiction to Claim 6.6.

(b) If k = 2t + 1, then it follows from Eq.(7) (10) and Claim 6.7 that

|B(2+)| > |F0 − L| −

a contradiction to Claim 6.8 (a).

+ 2 − 2(k − 1) > ex(n − t + 1, s, P2),

So we must have k = 2t. Similar as inequality above, by Eq.(7) (10) and Claims 6.7

and 6.8 (a) for k = 2t, we have

ex(n − t + 1, s, P2) ≥ |B(2+)| > |F0 − L| −

m =

which shows that m < 4ns−2

(s−2)! as required.

(cid:3)

Note that, applying Eq.(7) (10) again, Claims 6.7 and 6.8 provide a further estimation

of |B(2+)| as follows:

n − t − 1
s − 2

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

≥ |B(2+)| ≥ m − O(n) − O(1) + 2 − 2(k − 1).

(11)

Now we are preparing to ﬁnd certain edges aiming to lead a contradiction to Claim 6.6.

Claim 6.9 (i) For any j ∈ {1, k − 1}, there are at least two f ree(P ) vertices in ej, which
are not belonging to L.
(ii) There exist a f ree(P ) vertex x ∈ e1 and a f ree(P ) vertex y ∈ ek−1, such that x, y /∈ L
and not all edges in B(2+) containing both x and y.

Proof. (i) In fact, for any f ree(P ) vertex v ∈ ej ∩ L, and any f ree(P ) vertex u ∈ ej′, where
j, j′ ∈ {1, k − 1} and j 6= j′, the edge g consisting of u, v and s − 2 vertices in V \ V (P ),
k−1
must be colored with a color appeared in
i=1 ei; otherwise, we have a rainbow Ck. This
indicates that g is a missing-edge. Hence, if Claim 6.9 (i) dose not hold, then we count the
number of missing-edges as

S

m ≥ (s − 2)(s − 3)

(cid:18)

n − |V (P )|
s − 2

,

(cid:19)

violating Eq.(11). Hence Claim 6.9 (i) holds.

(ii) By Claim 6.9 (i), assume that x, z are f ree(P ) vertices in e1 \ L, and y is a f ree(P )
vertex in ek−1 \ L. By contradiction, suppose that all the edges of B(2+) contain the vertex
pair {x, y}, and all the edges of B(2+) contain the vertex pair {z, y} as well. Then all the
edges in B(2+) contain {x, y, z}, and so |B(2+)| ≤
, a contradiction to Eq.(11).
(cid:3)
This proves Claim 6.9 (ii).

n−t+1−3
s−3

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Finally, we are ready to complete the proof.

By Claim 6.9 (ii), there exist a f ree(P ) vertex x ∈ e1 and a f ree(P ) vertex y ∈ ek−1,
such that x, y /∈ L and not all edges in B(2+) containing both x and y. Let e∗ ∈ B(2+) be
such an edge that not containing both x and y.

Assume that x, y /∈ e∗. Since e∗ ∈ B(2+), we select a vertex u ∈ e∗ ∩ U , and so
u /∈ {x, y}. Consider an s-edge f consisting of x, y, u and s − 3 vertices disjoint with P ,
L and e∗, such that |f ∩ U | ≥ 2. Then we have f ∈ J, otherwise f ∪ P forms a rainbow
Ck. Thus f and e∗ form a rainbow P2 with |(f \ e∗) ∩ U | ≥ 1 and |(e∗ \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1, which
contradicts to Claim 6.6 (1).

Assume instead that one of x, y belongs to e∗. Without loss of generality, suppose that
{x} = e∗ ∩ {x, y}. Consider the edge g consisting of x, y and s − 2 vertices disjoint with
P , L and e∗, such that |(g \ {x}) ∩ U | ≥ 1. Then we have g ∈ J with the same reason as

36

above. Moreover, g and e∗ form a rainbow P2 with |(e∗ \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1, again contradicting
to Claim 6.6 (1).

Therefore, we establish the upper bound and complete the proof of Theorem 1.4.

7 Loose cycle–Proof of Theorem 1.5

Since the proof of Theorem 1.5 is similar to Theorem 1.4, in this section, we omit some
details and pay more attention to the diﬀerence between the proofs of Theorem 1.4 and
Theorem 1.5.

Let H be a complete s-uniform hypergraph on n vertices. Denote by V the vertex set
of H. The lower bound in Theorem 1.5 follows from a similar construction as Theorem 1.4
by applying the extreme s-graphs without Pk−1 obtained from Theorem 2.1.

For the upper bound, when k = 2t, since a loose cycle is also a linear cycle, we have

ar(n, s, Ck) ≤ ar(n, s, Ck) =

With similar argument as the proof of Claim 6.1, we have the following claim.

Claim 7.1 If F contains a linear path P1 of length k − 1, then F − E(P1) contains no
Pk−1.

If there is a linear path P1 of length k − 1 in F, then we let F0 = F − E(P1); if there is
no linear path of length k − 1 in F, we delete any k − 1 edges of F, and denote the subgraph
remained by F0. So we have

|F0| = |F| − 2(k − 1) =

and F0 is Pk−1-free.

Note that |F0| ∼ (t − 1)

. By Theorem 2.5, we can ﬁnd an (s − 1)-graph G∗ ⊂ ∂F0
and a set L of t−1 vertices of F0 such that L∩V (G∗) = ∅ and e∪{v} ∈ F0
with |G∗| ∼
for any (s − 1)-edge e ∈ G∗ and any v ∈ L. Moreover, |F0 − L| = o(ns−1). Select a G∗ with
the maximum number of (s − 1)-edges. Denote L = {v1, v2, . . . , vt−1} as before.

following similar claim.
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

Claim 7.2 When k = 2t + 1 ≥ 11, there are no three edges e, f, h in G − L satisfying that
one of the following conditions:
(i) e, f, h form a P3;
(ii) e, f form a P2, and h is disjoint with e ∪ f ;
(iii) e, f, h are pairwise disjoint.

The only diﬀerence between Claim 6.3 and Claim 7.2 is to construct a Ck rather than Ck to
obtain a contradiction, with essentially the same argument (see also Claim 5.4 for details).

Then, as P has length k, we can derive that P − L must contain edges satisfying one of

the conditions in Claim 7.2, giving the ﬁnial contradiction in the case m ≤

Claim 7.3 For k = 2t + 1, there are no two edges e, f ∈ F0 − L such that e, f form a P2,
|(f \ e) ∩ U | ≥ 1 or |(e \ f ) ∩ U | ≥ 1.

We still let B(i) = {e ∈ F0 − L :

Then the counting arguments in Claim 6.7 still holds that |B(0)| < m
Hence we have

|e ∩ U | = i} and B(2+) = B(2) ∪ B(3) ∪ . . . ∪ B(s).

By Claim 7.3, there are no two edges f1, f2 ∈ B(2+) such that |f1 ∩ U | = i and |f2 ∩ U | = j
with i 6= j. Moreover, for ﬁxed r, if |f1 ∩ U | = |f2 ∩ U | = r for two edges f1, f2 ∈ B(2+),
then f1 ∩ U = f2 ∩ U , i.e., all the edges in B(2+) contain exactly the same r vertices of U .
Then it follows that

8 Berge Path and Berge Cycle

We shall present the proofs of Theorem 1.6 and Proposition 1.7 on Berge paths and

Berge cycles in this section.

if k > 2s + 1, and
ar(n, s, Bk) ≥ n

into sets of size ⌊k/2⌋ (possibly one of those sets has size smaller than ⌊k/2⌋). Denote
by S1, S2, . . . , Sℓ those obtained sets of size ⌊k/2⌋. Then for each k-set Si, color each
edge contained in Si with a distinct color. The rest edges are colored with one additional
color. It is routine to check that there is no rainbow Bk in the above coloring. So we have

For 3 < k ≤ 2s + 1, we partition the n vertices into sets of size s + 1. Then we select
⌊k/2⌋ − 1 edges in each (s + 1)-set and color each of those edges with a diﬀerent color. The
rest edges are colored with one additional color. Similarly, this provides a n

without a rainbow Bk. Hence ar(n, s, Bk) ≥ n

Then either w1 6= z1 or w1 6= zk. Without loss of generality, suppose that w1 6= z1. Consider

a color belonging to {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}, then e ∪ P ∗ is a rainbow Bk. Therefore, we have
showed that

F contains no Bk−1.

Since |F| > ex(n, s, Bk−2) for suﬃciently large n, there is a Berge path P ′ of length
k − 2 in F. Denote by f1, f2, . . . , fk−2 the edges of P ′ with colors β1, β2, . . . , βk−2,
respectively. And there are k − 1 vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk−1 in P ′ such that ui, ui+1 ∈ fi
for i = 1, . . . , k − 2. Since F contains no Bk−1 by (13), the neighbors of u1 and uk−1 must
belong to {u1, u2, . . . , uk−1}. In fact, we shall further show in the following claim that the
neighbors of each vertex in {u2, . . . , uk−2} also belong to {u1, u2, . . . , uk−1}. Before that,
we need the deﬁnition of Berge cycles to state the following claim. An s-uniform Berge
cycle of length ℓ is a cyclic list of distinct s-sets a1, . . . , aℓ and ℓ distinct vertices v1, . . . , vℓ
such that for each i = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ, ai contains vi and vi+1 (where vℓ+1 = v1).

If there is a Berge cycle of length k − 1 and containing the vertices

u1, u2, . . . , uk−1, then u1, u2, . . . , uk−1 constitute a component of F.

(15)

Suppose that there is a Berge cycle C containing the vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk−1. If an edge
f in the C contains some vertex x other than u1, u2, . . . , uk−1, then deleting f from C, we
have a Bk−2, which can be extended to a Bk−1 with edge f , contradicting to (13). Thus
every edge in the cycle must be contained within the vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk−1. Moreover,
for each vertex ui in C, the neighbors of ui must belong to {u1, u2, . . . , uk−1}. Suppose to
the contrary that ui has a neighbor y other than u1, u2, . . . , uk−1. Then the edge containing
both ui and y is not an edge of C, as shown in the argument above. Thus, removing an
appropriate edge of C so that we get a path of length k − 2 with ui as an endpoint, and
hence we can extend this to a Bk−1 with y as an endpoint, a contradiction to (13). This
proves (15).

Now we show that one can always ﬁnd a Berge cycle of length k − 1 containing the
vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk−1. If there is an edge in F containing both u1 and uk−1, then we
If not, recall that by (14) we have δ(F) ≥

Let R denote the hypergraph obtained by deleting vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk−1 from F.
Then |R| ≥ n
> ex(n−(k −1), s, Bk−2) for suﬃciently large n. Hence
k−1
there is a Berge path P ′′ of length k−2 in R. Denote by h1, h2, . . . , hk−2 the edges of P ′′ with
colors γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−2, respectively. And there are k −1 vertices v1, v2, . . . , vk−1 in P ′′ such
that vi, vi+1 ∈ hi for i = 1, . . . , k − 2. Note that {u1, u2, . . . , uk−1} ∩ {v1, v2, . . . , vk−1} =
∅. Since we have either w1 /∈ {u1, v1} or w1 /∈ {uk−1, vk−1}, suppose, without loss of
generality, that w1 /∈ {u1, v1} holds. Consider the edge e′ with w1, u1, v1 and s − 3 vertices
in V (H) \ (V (P ) ∪ V (P ′) ∪ V (P ′′)).
If s > 3, e′ can only be colored with a color in
{α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}, then h1 ∪ e′ ∪ P ′ is a rainbow Bk. If s = 3, then e′ = {w1, u1, v1}. If
the color of e′ is not belonging to {β1, β2, . . . , βk−2} ∪ {γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−2}, then h1 ∪ e′ ∪ P ′
is a rainbow Bk. If the color of e′ is in {β1, β2, . . . , βk−2}, let ˜P = e′ ∪ P ′′, then ˜P is a
rainbow Bk−1 in H. Consider an edge e′′ = {w1, u1, x}, where x /∈ V (P ) ∪ V (P ′) ∪ V ( ˜P ).
To prevent extending P , the color of e′′ must be in {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}. However, to prevent
extending ˜P , e′′ must be colored with a color from {β1, β2, . . . , βk−2} ∪ {γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−2},
a contradiction. By symmetry, if the color of e′ is from {γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−2}, we can deduce
a similar contradiction as well. In conclusion, any coloring of H using n

k−1
yields a rainbow Bk.

(II) For k ≤ s + 1, let H be a complete s-uniform hypergraph on n vertices. Consider
a coloring of H using n(k−2)
s+1 + 1 colors and yielding no rainbow Bk. Let G be a subgraph
of H with n(k−2)
s+1 + 1 edges such that each color appears on exactly one edge of G. So the
number of edges of G is |G| = n(k−2)
s+1 + 1. Denote by C1, C2, . . . , Ct the components of G,
and n1, n2, . . . , nt the number of vertices of each components, respectively. Then there
is a component Ci, such that |Ci| > ni(k−2)
s+1 ≥ ex(ni, s, Bk−1). Hence there is a rainbow
Berge path P of length k − 1 in Ci. Denote by e1, e2, . . . , ek−1 the edges of P with colors
α1, α2, . . . , αk−1, respectively. And there are k vertices w1, w2, . . . , wk in P such that
wi, wi+1 ∈ ei for i = 1, . . . , k − 1. Let F be the hypergraph obtained by removing all the
edges of P from G. We have that |F| = (k−2)

s+1 n + 1 − (k − 1) = n(k−2)

s+1 − k + 2 > (k−3)

We will make use of the following result given in [25].

In both cases above, we denote by P ′ the Bk−2 we obtained, and denote by f1, f2,
. . . , fk−2 the edges of P ′ with colors β1, β2, . . . , βk−2, respectively. There are k − 1
vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk−1 in P ′ such that ui, ui+1 ∈ fi for i = 1, . . . , k − 2. Note that
u1 /∈ {w1, w2, . . . , wk}. Let R denote the hypergraph obtained by deleting f1, f2, . . . , fk−2
from F. Then |R| = k−2

α1, α2, . . . , αk−1, β1, β2, . . . , βk−2. Otherwise, C∗∗
ℓ ≥ s+1 ≥ k.
With the argument similar to the proof of (16), we can obtain that

Thus, there is a vertex not belonging to {u1, u2, . . . , uk−1, w1, w2, . . . , uk}. We still denote

it by v1. Take an edge e′ in C∗∗
ℓ
diﬀerent with α1, α2, . . . , αk−1, β1, β2, . . . , βk−2. Consider an edge e′′ containing w1, u1, v1,
it must be colored with a color from {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1} since otherwise P can be extended.
But then e′ ∪ e′′ ∪ P ′ is a rainbow Bk, a contradiction. Therefore, we have proved the upper
bound.

8.2 Berge Cycle–Proof of Proposition 1.7

Note that the lower bound in Proposition 1.7 is obvious, which follows from a similar
observation as in Eq.(1) for hypergraphs. Now we prove the upper bound in Proposition
1.7. Let H be a complete s-uniform hypergraph on n vertices. By contradiction, consider a
coloring of H using ex(n, s, Bk−1) + k colors yielding no rainbow BCk. Let G be a subgraph
of H with ex(n, s, Bk−1) + k edges such that each color appears on exactly one edge of G.
So the number of edges of G is |G| = ex(n, s, Bk−1) + k > ex(n, s, Bk−1). Hence there is a
rainbow Berge path P of length k − 1 in G. Denote by e1, e2, . . . , ek−1 the edges of P with
colors α1, α2, . . . , αk−1, respectively. And there are k vertices w1, w2, . . . , wk in P such
that wi, wi+1 ∈ ei for i = 1, . . . , k − 1.

Let F be the hypergraph obtained from G by removing all the edges of P . Then we
have that |F| = ex(n, s, Bk−1) + 1. Therefore, there is a Berge path P ∗ of length k − 1 in F.
Denote by g1, g2, . . . , gk−1 the edges of P ∗, where there are k vertices z1, z2, . . . , zk in P ∗
such that zi, zi+1 ∈ gi for i = 1, . . . , k − 1. Consider an s-edge e containing w1, wk, z1, zk.
If e is colored with a color not in {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}, then e ∪ P is a rainbow BCk. So e is
colored with a color belonging to {α1, α2, . . . , αk−1}, but now e ∪ P ∗ is a rainbow BCk, a
contradiction. Hence, ar(n, s, BCk−1) ≤ ex(n, s, Bk−1) + k for any possible n. This proves
Proposition 1.7.
