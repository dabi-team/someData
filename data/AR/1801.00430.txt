Abstract

We present a combined analysis of the applications of the weighted hor-
izontal magnetic gradient (denoted as W GM in Kors´os et al., ApJ, 802,
L21, 2015) method and the magnetic helicity tool ( Berger & Field, JFM,
147, 133, 1984) employed for three active regions (ARs), namely NOAA
AR11261, AR11283 and AR11429. We analyse the time series of photo-
spheric data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory taken between August
2011 and March 2012 during which period these AR have hosted 8 M- and
6 X-class ﬂares. All three active regions produced series ﬂares and CMEs.
AR 11261 had four M-class ﬂares where one was accompanied with a fast
CME. AR 11283 had similar activity with its two M- and two X- class ﬂares
occurred, however, only with a slow CME. Finally, AR 11429 was the most
powerful of the three active regions as it hosted ﬁve very compact solar erup-
tions. For applying the W GM method we employed the Debrecen Sunspot-
data Catalog and for estimating the magnetic helicity at the photospheric
level we used the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP’s)
magnetograms from SDO/HMI (Solar Dynamic Observatory/Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager). We followed the evolution of the components of
the W GM and the magnetic helicity before the ﬂare and CME occurrences.

We found an unique and mutually shared behavior, called the U-shaped
pattern, of the weighted distance component of W GM and of the shearing
component of the helicity ﬂux before the ﬂare and CME eruptions. This
common pattern is associated with the decreasing-receding phase yet re-
ported only known to be a necessary feature prior to solar ﬂare eruption(s),
but found now at the same time in the evolution of the shearing helicity
parameter. This result leads to the conclusion that (i) the shearing motion
of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld may be a key driver for the solar eruption in
addition to the ﬂux emerging process, and that (ii) the found decreasing-
approaching pattern in the evolution of shearing helicity may be another
precursor indicator for improving the forecasting of solar eruptions.

1. Introduction

The magnetic ﬁeld topology of a solar active region (AR) plays an impor-
tant role in the ﬂare and coronal mass ejection (CME) processes. Shearing
motion and ﬂux emerging are accounted for and viewed widely as respon-
sible for such eruptive changes in the magnetic ﬁeld topology of an AR.
Further, the large CMEs are often associated with more energetic ﬂares
(Yashiro, 2006; Hudson, 2010) indicative of a common underlying physical
mechanism of ﬂares and CMEs.

Adjacent opposite magnetic polarities associated with the sites of large-
scale eruptive events have their own strongly-sheared localised polarity in-
version line (PIL) where the magnetic ﬁeld gradient is high, and, which
indicates the existence of the intense electric currents and therefore large
free magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere (Schrijver, 2007). The free en-
ergy often becomes the energy source of ﬂares and CMEs. Therefore regions
around PILs are preferred area of interest to search for reliable precursors
of these dynamic events. A recent comparative review about the various
forecasting methods and their capabilities for predicting solar eruptions can
be found in (see, e.g., Benz, 2017; Leka et al., 2017, and references therein).
The magnetic ﬁeld is strongly sheared in ﬂaring locations (Hagyard et al.,
1990) and large-scale is shear built up through the slow motion of foot-
points stretching the length of loops (Roudier et al., 2008). In the litera-
ture, the important condition of ﬂux emergence is more widely accepted
than the shearing motion of the footpoint of AR to trigger solar ﬂares
(Chandra et al., 2009; Takafumi & Takaaki, 2014; Louis et al., 2015). A

general concept is that new emerging magnetic ﬂux (tube) may interact
with the pre-existing ﬂux (tubes) where reconnection may occur in the cur-
rent sheet, which forms between the old and new ﬂuxes. In this process the
importance of the emergence of the ﬂux may seem to outweigh the associ-
ated shearing of the magnetic ﬁeld, leading to focus by many on studying
the various measures of ﬂux emergence. By analysing magnetic helicity,
especially its shearing component, we argue that shearing may provide an
important clue prior to ﬂare and CME eruption.

Magnetic helicity in a volume V is deﬁned by H =

V A · Bdv, where
B is the magnetic ﬁeld, and A is the corresponding vector potential which
R
satisﬁes B = ∇ × A. Magnetic helicity in an open volume condition like in
ARs was ﬁrst introduced by Berger & Field (1984) as a description of how
the magnetic ﬁeld is sheared or twisted compared to a reference potential
ﬁeld (Berger, 1984). Analysing magnetic helicity provides insight into un-
derstanding the underlying mechanism of solar magnetic activities such as
ﬂare onset and of CMEs.

As a measure of the non-potentiality of the solar magnetic ﬁeld, mag-
netic helicity can either be generated by photospheric shearing motion or be
transported across the photosphere through emerging of twisted magnetic
structures (Zhang et al., 2012). During the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld,
the total magnetic helicity conservation cannot relax to a potential ﬁeld.
Therefore, the accumulated magnetic helicity could be a source of a CME
occurrence in a non-equilibrium state (D´emoulin, 2007; D´emoulin & Pariat,
2009). The amount of helicity stored in pre-ﬂare structures determines
whether a big ﬂare will be eruptive or conﬁned (Nindos & Andrews, 2004).
In this article, we investigate three diﬀerent ARs with the methods
of the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient (denoted as W GM ) devel-
oped in Kors´os et al. (2015) and a magnetic helicity analysis (Berger, 1984;
Berger & Field, 1984) for improving our ﬂare/CME capability prediction.
The application of the two methods focuses on the evolution of an active
region including analysis of sunspot movements and changes in magnetic
properties to improve the potentials to predict ﬂares and CMEs using pre-
eruption parameters. All three investigated active regions, namely ARs
11261, 11283 and 11429, produced a series ﬂares and CMEs (see for the
details Tables 1-3). From the three studied ARs the AR 11429 was the
most powerful as it hosted ﬁve very compact solar eruptions.
In Section
2, we describe the detailed analysis of three ARs by applying the W GM
method and by evaluating the evolution of their magnetic helicity, respec-

3

tively. Then, Section 3 concludes about the dedicated complementary use
of the W GM method and the magnetic helicity calculation in terms of the
ﬂare and CME forecasting capabilities.

2. Analysis

2.1. Application of weighted horizontal magnetic gradient in 3 diﬀerent

ARs

First, we investigate the pre-ﬂare and CME dynamics of AR 11261,
11283 and 11429 with the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient (denoted
as W GM ) between two opposite magnetic polarity sunspot groups intro-
duced by Kors´os et al. (2015). The method is based on tracking changes of
the solar surface magnetic conﬁguration in ARs, as ﬂare pre-cursors, with
about an hourly resolution, with the purpose of predicting energetic ﬂares,
above M5. In Kors´os et al. (2015), two diagnostic tools were introduced to
probe the pre-ﬂare behavior patterns. The ﬁrst one is based on the rela-
tionship between the values of the maxima of the W GM and the intensity
of the ﬂare(s). The viability of the relationship in terms of ﬂare forecast
capability was tested on the largest available statistical sample of 61 cases
observed during the SOHO/MDI era. It was concluded that this connection
may provide useful insights into the relationship between the accumulated
free energy, represented by W GM as a proxy measure, and the released en-
ergy represented by the highest GOES-class in a set of homologous ﬂares as
another proxy measure. The second tool developed, the prediction of the
ﬂare onset time, is based on the relationship found between the duration
of diverging motion of the barycenters of opposite polarities until the ﬂare
onset and duration of the compressing motion of the area-weighted barycen-
ters of opposite polarities. These new proxies greatly enhance the capability
of forecast, including (i) the expected highest intensity ﬂare-class; (ii) the
accuracy of onset time prediction and (iii) whether a ﬂare, stronger than
M5 in terms of the GOES classiﬁcation scheme, is followed by another same
energetic ﬂare event(s).

In the last columns of Figures 1, 2 and 3, ARs 11261, 11283 and
11429 are shown, in their white-light appearance (upper panel) and the
corresponding magnetogram (bottom panel). The red circles highlight the
study area for the use of the W GM method. The remaining panels of
Figures 1- 3 i.e the results derived from the analysis of the W GM , shows
the variation of the W GM (top panel), distance (middle panel), and net ﬂux
(bottom panel) over the analysed time series are plotted. In Figures 1- 3,
4

the vertical blue/green lines mark the M/X-class ﬂares. The column (b) of
Fig. 1 is associated with ”Area 1” and column (c) with ”Area 2”.

We may state, in general, that the pre-ﬂare behaviour of the weighted
horizontal magnetic gradient applied to the three studied ARs, (AR 11261,
11283 and 11429) conﬁrms well and is agreement with the results presented
by Kors´os et al. (2015). Indeed, we can recognised the distinguishing pre-
ﬂare behaviour of W GM i.e., that it has a steep rise and a high maximum
value followed by a less steep decrease before the ﬂare(s) occurred (up-
per panels of Figures 1- 3). Furthermore, by inspecting the middle panels
of Figures 1- 3 we observe that the distance parameter shows the unique
converging-diverging motion, often referred to as the U-shaped phase, prior
to the ﬂare(s) which is a necessary condition for the reconnection processes
associated with ﬂares (see Kors´os et al., 2015).

Let us now estimate the predicted maximum ﬂare intensity (Sf lare in
the 1-8 ˚A wavelength range of GOES) from the maximum value of W GM
according to Equation (1) of Kors´os & Ruderman (2016). The obtained es-
timated ﬂare classes are in the last but one column of Tables 1-3 for each
AR, respectively. The agreement with the measured GOES classiﬁcation
is acceptable but not best. In most cases only the estimated GOES-class
agrees with its measured counterpart. Therefore this tool may require fur-
ther reﬁnement for a better match. However, this is anyway not the subject
of the current work. Next, also estimate the predicted ﬂare onset times
(Tpred) from the variation of the moment of start time of the converging
phase (TC) of the distance by the next Equation in all investigated solar
eruptions, namely:

Tpred = a1 · TC + b1,

(1)

where a1 = 1.29(0.85) [hr] and b1 = 1.11(12.8) [hr] in the younger (older)
than three days case, respectively. In this study, the ﬁrst M9.3 class-ﬂare
of AR 11261 and the M5.3 class-ﬂare of AR 11283 happened before the
threshold of 72 hours have elapsed, while, the further 11 investigated ﬂares
all occurred after the 72-hr threshold. Therefore for the estimate of the
ﬂare onset time of the M9.3 (of AR 11261) and M5.3 (of AR 11283) ﬂares
we use a = 1.29 [hr] and b = 1.11 [hr] and for the 11 remain investigated
ﬂares, a = 0.85 [hrs] and b = 12.8 [hrs] in Equation (1). In general, one can
conclude that the Eq. (1) over-estimates the ﬂare onset time.

Tables 1-3 summarise the results of applying the W GM method, i.e.
we list the various properties of the investigated ﬂares and the accompa-

nied linear velocity (vlin) of the CME of the three active regions (AR11261,
AR11283 and AR11429). Furthermore, Tables 1-3 also include the maxi-
mum value of the W GM , value of W GM at the ﬂare onset, the duration of
the observed compressing phase (TC), elapsed time between the minimum
point until ﬂare onset (TD+F ), the predicted ﬂare onset time (Tpred com-
puted by Equation ( 1)), the predicted ﬂare intensity (Sf lare determined
by Equation (1) of Kors´os & Ruderman, 2016) and the ratio of maximum
value of the W GM and the value of the W GM at the ﬂare onset. The ratio
is also an important diagnostic tool of the W GM method, because as dis-
cussed in Kors´os et al. (2015), we found that if the value of W GM decreases
over than ∼54% after the local maxima of W GM then no further energetic
ﬂare(s) can be expected; but, if the maximum of the released ﬂare energy
is less than about 42%, further ﬂares are more probable.

In brieﬂy, we can conclude that the W GM method is fairly estimated the
expected ﬂare intensity and the estimated onset time. However, the ﬂare-
prediction capability of the W GM method could be further improved, by
analysing other physical quantities of ﬂaring ARs. Therefore we embark on
investigating the evolution of the total, shearing and the emerging helicity
of ARs before the ﬂare and CME eruptions for these three cases studies.

2.2. Magnetic Helicity Method and Application to 3 diﬀerent ARs case

Let us now determine the magnetic helicity associated with the three
ARs each, and, investigate their evolution prior the eruptions. The magnetic
helicity ﬂux across a surface S introduced by Berger (1984) can be expressed
as:

Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) was launched in 2010. The on-board
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) can map the full disk photospheric
vector magnetic ﬁeld with high cadence and long continuity. The vector
magnetograms employed in this study are from Space-weather HMI Active
Region Patches (SHARPs) with a spatial resolution of 1” and a 12 mins ca-
dence (Bobra et al., 2014). The photospheric plasma velocity was calculated
using the Diﬀerential Aﬃne Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms
(DAVE4VM) algorithm (Schuck, 2008), the window size used in the calcula-
tion is 19 pixels, which was determined by examining non-parametric Spear-
man rank order correlation coeﬃcients, Pearson correlation coeﬃcients and
slopes between ∆h · (vzBh − vhBz) and δBz/δt (Schuck, 2008). The vector
potential Ap is derived using MUDPACK (Adams, 1993), a multigrid soft-
ware for solving elliptic partial diﬀerential equations. Then, we calculated

magnetic helicity from these active regions using Equation (2). The helicity
injection rate could be obtained by integrating over the entire calculation
area. Magnetic helicity generated by shearing motion and emerging motion
are calculated separately, and the total helicity is these combination of the
two components.

Temporal proﬁles of helicity ﬂuxes in the three ARs are plotted in Fig-
ures 4, 5 and 6. In each ﬁgure, the bottom panel is the helicity ﬂux, while
the red dashed line is the magnetic helicity ﬂux generated by shearing and
twisting movements at the photosphere, the blue dot line stands for that
transported across the photosphere, and the black solid line is the total
magnetic ﬂux. The top panel shows the accumulated helicity which is ob-
tained by integrating the helicity ﬂux from the start of the observation to
the speciﬁed time.

As there are several big gaps in SHARP’s data from March 3 to March
11 while with no vector magnetograms, helicity ﬂuxes in Figure 6 had been
separated into ﬁve segments and the accumulated helicity’s time sequence
was calculated from 00:00:00 UTC, March 4 to 06:36:00 UTC, March 7.

The magnetic helicity ﬂux shows a decrease before every M-class or
above ﬂares (see, e.g., Smyrli et al., 2010, and references therein). In AR

11261, the magnetic helicity decrease from the pre-ﬂare highest time to
the ﬂare on-set time is 1.7 × 1038 Mx2s−1, which is 3.6 × 1037 Mx2s−1,
1.6 × 1038 Mx2s−1 and 2.1 × 1038 Mx2s−1 for the following ARs.
In AR
11283, the decrease before each AR is 1.7 × 1038 Mx2s−1, 8 × 1037 Mx2s−1,
2.1 × 1038 Mx2s−1 and 1.3 × 1038 Mx2s−1. The total helicity ﬂux in AR
11429 is negative, the absolute value has a decrease of 1.2 × 1039 Mx2s−1 in
the ﬁrst X1.1 ﬂare, and a total of 1.8 × 1039 Mx2s−1 change in the following
two X-class ﬂares. With three X-class ﬂares and two M-class ones being
produced in AR 11429 and a corresponding much higher helicity injection
than that in the other two ARs (AR 11261 and 11283), it suggests that
large helicity ﬂux which injects magnetic free energy continuously into the
solar atmosphere may results in ﬁerce ﬂare eruptions. Also, the magnetic
helicity ﬂux from emerging motion is more stable than that from shearing
motion which ﬂuctuates considerable during the AR’s life time. It also can
be found that before large ﬂares, the helicity ﬂux from shearing motion
dominated the helicity accumulation, which indicates its essential position
in solar eruptions.

Besides, several clear long-duration decreasing-increasing phases could
be found in either the total helicity ﬂux or the shearing helicity ﬂux before
large ﬂares, even covered a day during the entire phase. Strong shearing
movement along the PIL introduced large shearing helicity ﬂuxes with op-
posite sign in both sides of the PIL resulting in a downward trend in the
total shearing helicity ﬂux in the entire area of interest. When such shearing
motion became weakened, the total shearing helicity would increase with
the domination of one polarity’s helicity ﬂux.

3. Conclusion

There are several ﬂare-forecasting methods based on photospheric obser-
vations of the ARs in the solar atmosphere. Here, we applied two diﬀerent
approaches to develop the basics of a good and reliable ﬂare and CME
prediction model (for a review see Benz, 2017; Leka et al., 2017, and refer-
ences therein). One approach is the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient
method (denoted as W GM ) introduced in Kors´os et al. (2015) and the sec-
ond one is employing magnetic helicity (Berger, 1984; Berger & Field, 1984).
We tested these two methods in three diﬀerent ﬂare- and CME-rich ARs,
namely AR 11261, 11283 and 11429. All three active regions produced a
series of solar eruptive occurrances. AR 11261 hosted four M-class ﬂares
where one was accompanied with a fast CME. AR 11283 had similar activ-
12

ity than AR 11261 with two M- and two X-class ﬂares, however, only with
a slow CME. Finally, AR 11429 was the most powerful of the three active
regions as it gave birth to ﬁve very compact solar eruptions.

Applying the ﬁrst investigation, we follow the temporal evolution of
W GM and the distance between the area-weighted barycenters of opposite
polarities within an appropriately deﬁned region close to the magnetic po-
larity inversion line (PIL) of the three studied ARs. During the empirical
analyses of the three ARs, ﬁrst, we recognised typical pre-ﬂare behaviour
patterns of W GM and distance likewise in Kors´os et al. (2015). One re-
markable behaviour of opposite polarities is that, there is indeed the steep
rise, and the maximum value of the magnetic ﬂux gradient is followed by a
less steep decrease before the ﬂare and CME occurrences. Parallel to the in-
creasing/decreasing trends of W GM , concurrent decreasing/increasing (ap-
proaching/receding) trends of distances, called as U-shaped pattern, were
also observed for opposite polarity spots.

The second approach is employing the total magnetic helicity calcula-
tion. We separately followed the evolution of the total, emerging and shear-
ing helicity components prior the ﬂare and CME occurrences. In general,
the total magnetic helicity is divided into two terms, one is from the emer-
gence of twisted ﬁeld lines that cross the photospheric surface (this is the
so-called emerging helicity) and the other one is from the shearing motion
in the photosphere that are twisting ﬁeld lines (this is where the shearing
helicity comes from) (Berger, 1984; Berger & Field, 1984).

In the helicity calculation, we recognized similar decreasing -increasing
phases in the evolution of shearing and total helicity before the ﬂare(s) and
CME(s) occurred, just as found for the decreasing-receding phase of ﬂares
when applying W GM . This common property is highlighted by red parabo-
lae in Figures 1– 6. We can also conclude that the duration of decreasing-
increasing phases are very comparable during the evolution of shearing he-
licity and distance between the area-weighted barycenters of the spots of
opposite polarities. Furthermore, we note that we cannot determine any
meaningful behaviour in the evolution of the emerging helicity. Therefore,
it is worth pointing out that the shearing motions may play a more impor-
tant role in the formation of total helicity because the value of emerging
helicity is negligible when compared to the value of the shearing helicity.

According to our empirical case studies, we can clearly identify a com-
mon decreasing-increasing phase in the evolution of shearing helicity and
weighted distance prior to ﬂare and CME eruptions (see Figs. 1– 6). This

13

new result is really interesting, because we may conclude that the shearing
mechanism may also be an equally key driver for the solar eruption, and
perhaps not only the so much studied emerging process is relevant. In the
literature, there are several ﬂare and CME models based on the photospheric
shear motion. Sturrock & Coppi (1966) introduced the tearing-mode insta-
bility model which is based on the shearing motion at the photosphere, or
there is the model of sheared loops inside arcade by Somov et al. (1998).
The magnetic breakout model, presented by Antiochoset al. (1999) is also
based on photospheric shearing motions. But, in the literature, the emerg-
ing ﬂux process seems to be more favoured and more acceptable (see, e.g.,
Chandra et al., 2009; Takafumi & Takaaki, 2014; Louis et al., 2015, and ref-
erences therein) when trying to understand ﬂare/CME eruption dynamics.
We would also emphasise that we do not say that the emerging process
is not needed for analysing or predicting large-scale solar eruptions. On
the contrary, without ﬂux emergence there is, of course, likely no ﬂaring.
Finally, we argue that there is a need for a much larger statistical study in
order to conﬁrm our conjecture formulated in this work. However, this is
beyond the scope of the present case studies.
