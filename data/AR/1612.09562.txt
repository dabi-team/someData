ABSTRACT

Context. The dynamics of the ﬂaring loops in active region (AR) 11429 are studied. The observed dynamics consist of several
evolution stages of the ﬂaring loop system during both the ascending and descending phases of the registered M-class ﬂare. The
dynamical properties can also be classiﬁed by diﬀerent types of magnetic reconnection, related plasma ejection and aperiodic ﬂows,
quasi-periodic oscillatory motions, and rapid temperature and density changes, among others. The focus of the present paper is on a
speciﬁc time interval during the ascending (pre-ﬂare) phase.
Aims. The goal is to understand the quasi-periodic behavior in both space and time of the magnetic loop structures during the
considered time interval.
Methods. We have studied the characteristic location, motion, and periodicity properties of the ﬂaring loops by examining space-time
diagrams and intensity variation analysis along the coronal magnetic loops using AIA intensity and HMI magnetogram images (from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO)).
Results. We detected bright plasma blobs along the coronal loop during the ascending phase of the solar ﬂare, the intensity variations
of which clearly show quasi-periodic behavior. We also determined the periods of these oscillations.
Conclusions. Two diﬀerent interpretations are presented for the observed dynamics. Firstly, the oscillations are interpreted as the
manifestation of non-fundamental harmonics of longitudinal standing acoustic oscillations driven by the thermodynamically non-
equilibrium background (with time variable density and temperature). The second possible interpretation we provide is that the
observed bright blobs could be a signature of a strongly twisted coronal loop that is kink unstable.

1. Introduction

magnetic reconnection plays a key role in the driving mechanism
of these events.

The complex magnetic ﬁelds in the solar corona represent causes
and energy sources for diﬀerent eruptive and explosive events.
In turn, such events are often precursors of large space weather
phenomena and play a central role in the formation of local so-
lar weather conditions. The magnetic properties of the ejected
plasma clouds strongly aﬀect the space weather related mag-
netic storms in the magnetosphere of the Earth. A proper ob-
servational and analytical study of these phenomena and of the
physical mechanisms behind them is important for understand-
ing the solar atmospheric and heliospheric dynamics as part of
the uniﬁed Sun-Earth system. In fact, this is one of the key tasks
of the forthcoming Solar Orbiter (ESA) mission. In the solar and
space weather context, ﬂares and other explosive events have
been studied by many authors. There is a general concensus that

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and oscillations in
various solar structures often lead to instabilities, which in turn
can trigger solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). As
a matter of fact, oscillatory regimes of magnetic reconnection
can modulate ﬂare processes and show quasi-periodic proper-
ties (Kliem et al., 2000; Asai et al., 2001). Quasi-periodic pulsa-
tions (QPPs) are associated with ﬂare energy releases in the so-
lar atmosphere, which are observed in radio, soft X-ray (SXR),
hard X-ray (HXR), extreme ultraviolet (EUV), and in gamma ray
emissions (Roberts et al., 1984; F´arn´ık et al., 2003; Nakariakov
& Melnikov, 2006, 2009; Nakariakov et al., 2010). The period
of QPPs ranges from sub-seconds to tens of minutes (see, e.g.,
Tan, 2008; Nakariakov & Melnikov, 2009; Karlick´y et al., 2010;
Kupriyanova et al., 2010; Su et al., 2012, and references therein).

ﬂare. With the arrows we show time intervals of evidence of oscillatory phenomena and magnetic reconnection. The reconnection
starting time corresponds to the peak on ﬂux derivative plot.

Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the
generation of QPPs. The most elaborated model of QPPs consid-
ers MHD oscillations, which aﬀect almost all aspects of the ﬂare
emission generation. Indeed, QPPs are involved in triggering the
magnetic reconnection, modulating the reconnection rate, accel-
erating and transporting non-thermal electrons, and changing the
physical conditions in emitters (Nakariakov & Melnikov, 2009).
Other models are based on a sandpile system with self-organized
critical states (Lu & Hamilton, 1991; Baiesi et al., 2008), the
quasi-stabilized system of non-linear plasmas governed by an
oscillatory phase of wave-wave or wave-particle interactions
(Aschwanden, 1987). Diﬀerent MHD oscillation modes have
been identiﬁed to be responsible for QPPs in a single ﬂaring loop
(Nakariakov et al., 2003; Melnikov et al., 2005; Warmuth et al.,
2005; Inglis et al., 2008; Kupriyanova et al., 2010; Kim et al.,
2012; Kupriyanova et al., 2013). Kolotkov et al. (2015) stud-
ied the QPPs of the microwave emission generated in a X3.2-
class solar ﬂare. They found three well-deﬁned intrinsic modes
with mean periods of 15, 45, and 100 s. These authors pro-
posed that the 100 s and 15 s modes are likely to be associ-
ated with fundamental kink and sausage modes of the ﬂaring
loop, respectively. The 100s oscillations could also be caused
by the fundamental longitudinal mode. The 45s mode, on the
other hand, could be the second standing harmonic of the kink
mode. Inglis & Nakariakov (2009) reported a multi-periodic os-
cillatory event with three distinct periods, namely 28 s, 18 s,
and 12 s. They argued that the cause of this multi-periodic
event is likely to be a kink mode that periodically triggers mag-
netic reconnection. Similar QPPs could be generated by diﬀer-
ent mechanisms. To discover, understand, and distinguish these
mechanisms correctly, detailed and multi-wavelength observa-
tions are required. Within the framework of the EU FP7-project

SOLSPANET (www.solspanet.eu), we are developing a solar
and space-weather knowledge base that will allow such exten-
sive and detailed studies.

In the present paper, we discuss only the ascending phase
of the solar ﬂare that was observed by SDO/AIA on March 6,
2012, in NOAA active region 11429. An M2.1-class ﬂare oc-
curred at 12:23 UT, peaked at 12:41 UT and underwent a decay
phase until 23:56 UT. From 12:20 UT until 12:36 UT, a variety
of phenomena took place, including quasi-periodic oscillations,
magnetic reconnection, and rapid plasma ejection that may have
triggered the solar ﬂare. Observations of the solar ﬂare and the
physical parameters of the ﬂaring loops are described in sec-
tion 2. Section 3 provides a description of the features of the
oscillations and a physical analysis. The discussion and conclu-
sions are given in the last section.

2. Observations and data processing

We employ SDO observations to study the dynamics of active
region (AR) NOAA 11429. We combined observations from dif-
ferent instruments on board the SDO spacecraft (Pesnell et al.,
2012) so as to cover the wide range of heights in the solar at-
mosphere in the vicinity of the ﬂaring region. In particular, the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) (Lemen et al., 2012) en-
ables continuous imaging of the full disc of the Sun in a temper-
ature range from ∼ 5000 K to ∼ 20 MK, at 12 sec time intervals
and at spatial resolution of 0.6 arcsec per pixel. AIA has two UV
and seven narrow EUV passbands; six of the EUV narrowbands
are sensitive to diﬀerent iron ionization lines formed at diﬀerent
temperatures, which are used to study the coronal structure at
diﬀerent heights. The AIA channel in the 304 Å extreme ultra-
violet band shows the ﬁrst ionization helium (He II) lines, which

foot points of the L2 loop, respectively. In panel (b), the rectangular polygon shows the location of the studied ﬂaring loops.

time when the L1 and L2 loops widened and the evident magnetic reconnection started between them.

serve areas in the chromosphere and the lower transition region.
High-resolution (0.6.(cid:48)(cid:48)) magnetograms were obtained from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and these data have
been used to observe the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of the con-
sidered AR. As a matter of fact, HMI measures the full solar disk

line of sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁelds, vector magnetic ﬁelds, and
Doppler velocities in the photosphere. We used HMI LOS mag-
netograms in the Fe I absorption line with wavelength 6173 Å
at 45 sec time intervals. We also employed observations of the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to

To download, calibrate, and analyze AIA and HMI data, we used
standard routines in the Solarsoftware (SSW) package. In or-
der to co-align all the AIA multi-wavelength images and the
HMI magnetograms, we ﬁrst determined the matching times be-
fore rotating the HMI magnetograms to match the ﬁelds of view
(FOV) of the diﬀerent instruments.

The considered AR 11429 has released 2 B-, 43 C-, 15 M-
and 3 X-class ﬂares (i.e., 61 ﬂares in total) during its transit
over the solar disk. This AR was also the source of several
CMEs. Among those 61 ﬂares, only 7 C-, 6 M-, and 3 X-class
ﬂares were associated with CMEs. The ﬂare of interest in the
present paper was observed near the southwest limb with the
UTC-HGS-TOPO (Heliographic Stonyhurst) coordinates: -40,
21. It is important to note that there were no CMEs associated

with this particular ﬂare. The soft X-ray ﬂux (1 − 8 Å) peak
recorded by the X-ray monitor on board GOES reached the value
2.1 × 10−5 Wm−2, the ﬂare magnitude M2.1. According to the
GOES ﬂux plot, the ﬂare had an impulsive rise phase between
12:23 UT and 12:41 UT followed by a gradual decay phase until
12:54 UT (Fig.1).

2.1. Ascending phase of the ﬂare

Figure 2 displays the AIA/SDO photospheric image of AR
11429 in 1600 Å line at 12:25:53 UT, on March 6, 2012. It is co-
aligned with the HMI LOS magnetic ﬁeld image corresponding
to the same moment and the magnetic ﬁeld contours are overlaid
on the image. The blue and yellow colors represent the diﬀer-
ent polarities of the magnetic ﬁeld. Ellipses show the position
of sunspots where the foot points of the studied coronal loops
are probably anchored. Panel b of Fig. 2 shows a co-aligned

AIA/SDO coronal image in the 171 Å line at 12:26:00 UT, in
which the ﬂaring loops are enveloped by the white rectangle.

General information about the evolution of the ﬂare is shown
in Fig. 3. This ﬁgure shows partial coronal snapshots of AR
11429 observed by the AIA/SDO in 171 Å line (Fe ix) between
12:22 and 12:31 UT at diﬀerent moments. At the moment of the
ﬂare start-time, only magnetic loop (L1) was observable, which
is shown with the red contour in Fig. 3 panel 1. After a few
minutes, at approximately 12:25 UT, a second ﬂaring loop (L2)
brightened (cf. red contour in Fig. 3 panel 2 and in this wave-
length, these two loops are hard to separate from one another in
the image. The foot points of the L1 loop are associated with
magnetic spots L1a (negative polarity) and L1b (positive polar-
ity). The coronal loop L2 is longer and more extended; its left
leg is presumably anchored in a small positive magnetic polarity
spot L2a and its right leg into the negative polarity spot L2b, as
shown in Fig. 2 panel (a).

Fig. 8. Same as Fig. 6 but for the intensity minima, middle points for neighboring two bright blobs as marked in Fig. 4 panel (c).

Then, at 12:26 UT, hot plasma was injected along loop L1,
which caused its widening. At wavelength 171 Å, the consid-
ered magnetic loop starts to break oﬀ asymmetrically at 12:31
UT (panel 3 of Fig. 3) and afterwards part of it disappears. Our
current analysis covers the interval of time from 12:23 to 12:30
UT.

The evolution of the loops has been observed not only in the
171 Å line, but also at other wavelengths. Similar behavior is
seen in the AIA 193 Å channel (Fe XII, XXIV) which is de-
signed to observe areas in the corona and hot ﬂare plasma with
temperatures 1.2 × 106 K and 2 × 107 K, respectively.

We observed the same phenomenon at other AIA/SDO
wavelengths as well, namely in the 335 Å and 211 Å channels.
These channels correspond to the active region corona with tem-
peratures 2 × 106 K and 2.5 × 107 K, respectively. The magnetic
structures at these wavelengths cannot be clearly resolved from
the background emission. A blurred conﬁguration can be seen
in 94 Å, 131 Å line images, channels that are used to observe
ﬂaring regions with temperatures higher than 6 × 106 K.

To estimate the physical parameters of the loop L1, we used
diﬀerent SDO images in the AIA/SDO 171 Å series. The ﬁlters
of this channel are designed to provide visibility of high-contrast
scenes, such as solar ﬂares, and are especially good for studying
faint coronal features. The most clear image of the loop is seen at
12:25:36 UT. We therefore used this frame to measure the loop
length, which amounts to ∼ 36 Mm.

We also measured the distance between the foot points of
the L1 loop using LOS HMI images ∼ 23 Mm = 32 pixels.
However, taking into account the projection eﬀects and consid-
ering the loop as a structure equal or longer than a semicircle, the
length of the loop L1 can be estimated as L > πd/2 and should
be more than 50 pixels (Fig. 2).

Therefore, taking into account all these physical parame-
ters and AIA/SDO characteristic temperatures (corresponding
mainly to the 171 Å and 304 Å wavelengths), we suppose that
the observed magnetic loop is located in the lower corona and the
temperature of the ﬂaring loop plausibly varies between 6.3×105
and 1.2 × 106 K.

on the loop length. Derived radii with the Gaussian Fitting increases from 2.3Mm to 3.7Mm. Panel (b) shows distance between
neighboring turns. Panel (c) shows the critical value for kink instability criterion for large aspect ratio loops. Above the critical
value of 1, this criterion is satisﬁed and the occurrence of the kink instability is likely.

3. Oscillations

We detected oscillatory motions in the ﬂaring loop L1. In this
section, we ﬁrst describe the physical parameters of the observed
quasi-periodic oscillations and then present two diﬀerent inter-
pretations of these results in separate subsections.

blob does not show any movement at all. There were also no
strong movements detected between the other blobs. Therefore,
if we were to interpret these patterns as a kind of body wave
motion within the loop, one would deﬁnitely assume that we are
dealing with standing wave patterns.

3.1. Longitudinal standing acoustic modes

From the ﬂare onset time 12:23 UT to 12:30 UT in 171 Å line
images, ﬁve bright blobs occurred along the loop L1 and these
blobs vividly showed periodic brightening behavior over time.

Fig. 4 displays partial 171 Å images from 12:24:48 UT to
12:26:48 UT at intervals of 24 sec. We show these snapshots
as illustrative examples for the temporal analysis of the data that
was performed for the entire period. In panel (a) of Fig. 4, we see
the above mentioned bright blobs, which presumably represent
density enhancements within the loop. We studied de-trended in-
tensity changes along loop L1 using the set of obtained one-pixel
cuts. In Fig. 4(b), we show only the line between two neigh-
boring blobs connecting points S and E in panel (b) of Fig. 4.
In panel (g), the corresponding intensities along the slices S-E
(black lines) are plotted. The obtained data sets are ﬁtted by a
sine function a sin(bx + c) (red lines) along the same slices. The
dotted lines connect the diﬀerent maxima corresponding to the
blobs. The upper blob moved approximately 1.45 Mm towards
the second blob with velocity v ∼ 12 km/s, which is negligible
within the resolution of current measurements, while the second

The latter assumption needs to be proven by investigating
other properties of the observed pattern. For this purpose, the
following was carried out: we ﬁrst smoothed the data with 2 box-
car by the routine ‘SMOOTH’ available in IDL. The SMOOTH
function returns a copy of array smoothed with a boxcar aver-
age of the speciﬁed width and the result has the same type and
dimensions as the given array. Then, we made cuts of the loop,
locally orthogonal to the loop axes, which are separated by a
distance of approximately 1 pixel. Using this method, we ob-
tained 50 cuts in total between two foot points of the loop (as it
is shown in panel 1 of Fig. 3). Next, we performed a Gaussian
ﬁt of the intensity curves along these cuts. The half width of the
Gaussian provided values of the loop local width, which show
that the radius of the loop changes between 3 and 5 pixels along
it. Also, the peaks of the Gaussian ﬁts revealed 50 consecutive
approximative middle points of the loop enabling us to draw a
curved axis of the loop corresponding to a given moment of time,
and we recorded the intensity values accordingly at these points.
By repeating this procedure for 65 moments of time (snapshots)
during the entire period of interest, we obtained a time series
of intensity variability at all of the above mentioned 50 middle
points of the loop axis.

Further analyzing these data, we next ploted the time-
distance diagram as shown in Fig. 5 panel (a) from 12:18 UT to
12:30 UT. In Fig. 6 we display the original time series obtained
for only the ﬁrst four blobs, and in Fig. 7, the corresponding de-
trended version of the same data is shown, corresponding to the
time-distance diagram given in Fig. 5. We applied the piecewise
linear de-trendisation method. For the ﬁfth blob, that is situated
very close to L1a (Fig. 3), the oscillatory signal is not clearly re-
solvable due to the signiﬁcant tilt of the loop in that part towards
the line of sight and the over exposure of the snapshots because
of the high local temperature. That is why we did not perform
a detailed analysis of this blob, neither within the framework of
Fig. 5 nor in Figs. 6 or 7. However, we still assume that there are
ﬁve density blobs (marked with crosses in Panel (a) of Fig. 4),
and below we make our estimations of modal parameters based
on this assumption. Before doing so, we provide a very impor-
tant description of the mode type recognition method we em-
ployed.

From the diagram in panel (a) of Fig. 5 it becomes evident
that we can clearly resolve at least four consecutive blobs (the
ﬁfth one only partially) and the intensity of each of them quasi-
periodically oscillating in time. In panel (b) we show a sketch
of the blobs represented by white circles on a black background
at the moments when the intensities at the central pixels of the
blobs are maximal. It is easy to see that the four rows of circles
shown do not oscillate in phase and, moreover, that they are ap-
proximately in anti-phase to one another. In panel (a) there are
also clearly resolved whitened ridges of the intensity connecting
the bright points in diﬀerent rows. We represent these by thin
vertices connecting the circle nodes of the graph in panel (b).
This observation leads us to the conclusion that the intensity os-
cillation we observe cannot be due to one fundamental or har-
monic mode as this would require the oscillation of the entire
loop in phase; and the observed ridges (vertices) indicate den-
sity enhancements related to the ﬂow of the plasma between the
density antinodes (velocity nodes, since as we observed above,
the brightened blobs do not move) of the standing mode pat-
tern. Moreover, as these ﬂows occur along the loop axis, it is
very plausible that we see the standing pattern of the longitu-
dinal (acoustic mode), provided that each pair of consecutive
blobs oscillates approximately in phase opposition. Of course,
the graph plotted in panel (b) shows certain deformations of the
pattern compared to the classical standing acoustic mode one (as
is shown in panel (c)); and these deformations can be ascribed
to the non-standard geometry of the magnetic loop and, more
importantly, we are observing these oscillations in the ascending
phase of the ﬂare, when drastic rises of temperature and inﬂows
of dense hot plasmas in the loop occur (see Fig. 6 for each blob
separately).

On the one hand, we can assume that the observed high (non-
fundamental) harmonic of the standing acoustic mode can be
excited and driven by such thermodynamically non-equilibrium
source processes. We suppose that the mode can even be ex-
cited by multiple non-equilibrium sources simultaneously due to
the strong couplings caused by the rapid change in background
temperature and density (the analytical description of such cou-
plings, in general, has been given in Shergelashvili et al. (2007),
and for the current particular case a similar modeling is beyond
the main scope of this work, which is mostly of the observa-
tional kind, and will thus be addressed elsewhere). On the other
hand, the presence of the non-equilibrium background actually
causes non-uniform distribution of the plasma characteristics,
such as temperature and density, along the loop, resulting in its
fragmentation and perhaps leading to noticeable deformations of

10

the standing mode pattern compared to the standard case of os-
cillations over a background in thermodynamic equilibrium, as
sketched in panel (c). As we can see in Figs. 6 and 8, clear coher-
ent oscillatory patterns form at 12:23 UT and last until 12:30 UT
(marked with vertical lines). While initially starting from 12:18
UT and continuing until 12:23 UT, the signal is spurious and
barely resolvable at all, although the background plasma param-
eters are already engaged in the uptrend of the started ﬂare (see
Fig. 1) and the loop is already in non-equilibrium state. One can
suppose that this is the very time span when, presumably driven
by multiple external sources, high harmonic modes may prop-
agate in diﬀerent directions to form the standing wave pattern.
As a matter of fact, two consecutive blobs oscillate in almost op-
posite phase, meaning that the distance between the blobs cor-
responds to half of the wavelength (see detailed calculations be-
low).

In all top panels Ak, k = 1, 2, 3, 4 of Fig. 7, we show the
piecewise linearly de-trended time series that enabled us to ex-
tract only the well depicted oscillatory part from the original
signal. Then, for this analysis, we reduced the total time span
to 12:23-12:30 UT, because after this moment the structure of
the observed loop is destroyed as another large reconnection oc-
curs bringing the ﬂare to the next stage of its evolution towards
the peak M2.1 class. The analysis of the dynamical processes
after 12:30 UT goes beyond the scope of the current study and
will be presented in a separate publication. In the present pa-
per, our main focus is simply to understand the properties of
the oscillatory phenomenon we observe in the bright blobs. This
process starts due to a chain of small reconnection events occur-
ring during the initial stage of ﬂare ascending phase (that started
at approximately 12:20 UT) and ending at approximately 12:30
UT. In the mentioned panels Ak, the solid lines show the ﬁtted
sine function and the de-trended data are presented by aster-
isks. Figure 9 is constructed in the same manner, but for velocity
antinodes.

Similarly, we plot the original time curves for the inten-
sity minima between neighboring blobs (marked in panel (c) of
Fig. 4,) in Fig. 8 separately. The density minima (velocity antin-
odes) can also be seen to oscillate in phase with the density max-
ima (velocity nodes). However, the oscillation amplitude of the
antinodes is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the velocity nodes,
which at ﬁrst glance contradicts the classical theoretical picture
of such standing modes. We performed the same analysis for
these and Fig. 9 shows the de-trended time series with the ﬁtted
functions.

Next, we estimated the signiﬁcance of the observed oscilla-
tion signal with respect to the error level. To examine the level of
conﬁdence of the observed oscillations, we calculated the stan-
dard deviation of the given data (D) from their respective approx-
imated sine function (F) on panels Bk, k = 1, 2, 3, 4 in Fig. 7 and
Fig. 9. We also determined the amplitude for each de-trended
curve and calculated the ratio of ﬁtting errors to amplitude for
each velocity node and antinode separately (plotted with dashed
lines) as follows:

We evaluated the error between the data (D) and the ﬁtted

sine function (F) by using the following formula:

where n is the number of samples and A is the average am-

panels, the dotted horizontal line represents the average error for
the whole considered time span (overall error e0) and the solid
horizontal line shows the average error corresponding to the
shorter time span (precise error ep) up to approximately 12:28
UT, where the ﬁtting function manifests the variation of intensity
most adequately and, as we see in all top panels after this mo-
ment of time, the discrepancy between the ﬁtted and observed
data increases noticeably because of changes in the loop conﬁg-
uration itself. The presence of such discrepancy is unavoidable
as we ﬁt the sine function with the ﬁxed period and initial phase,
while in real data, the period changes signiﬁcantly due to mod-
iﬁcation of physical conditions in the loop, such as density and
temperature. For instance, we see that in panel A1, the period
of oscillation increases, meaning that locally in this blob, the
phase speed (sound speed) decreases. On the other hand, we see
in panel A2 that the period decreased after 12:28 UT, indicating
that the sound speed increased locally in this blob. The situation
is similar in other blobs as well. For this reason, we think that
the average error calculated for the time span before approxi-
mately 12:28 UT shows the realistic error level of our ﬁttings
and the average value of the error for all panels is approximately
24%, while means of the errors for the entire time span show sig-
niﬁcantly higher percentages (on average 65%), as is expected
from the above argumentation. In the case of velocity antinodes,
even for the best possible ﬁttings, the error levels for the shorter
time spans are on average at least 50%, with the values for the
whole time span reaching up to 83%. These arguments lead us
to the conclusion that in the case of blobs, we see real oscil-
lations of the intensity with a signiﬁcantly high level of conﬁ-
dence. At the same time, in the case of velocity antinodes, the
observed average amplitudes are noticeably smaller compared
to the case of blobs. Besides, the periods of the oscillations, that
we retrieve using the ﬁtting on sine function, show very large
discrepancies with one another. Thus, they could not represent a
single monochromatic oscillation pattern. Therefore, we assume
that the variations of intensity we see in the velocity antinodes
are not real oscillations, but instead represent some artefact that
could be caused by projection and/or other eﬀects. The values
of the obtained periods, amplitudes, mean errors, and best ﬁtting
errors for each curve are given in table 1.

The wavelength of the observed quasi-periodic oscillations

can be derived as:
λ = 2L

N

>

= 14540 km ≈ 14.5 Mm,

(2)

where, L denotes the length of the L1 loop and N is the num-

ber of blobs.

Based on the observational facts and the data analysis pre-
sented, we suggest that these oscillations with a characteristic
period of 116 sec could be longitudinal acoustic/slow standing
waves. In this case it would correspond to the ﬁfth harmonic, as
we detected ﬁve bright blobs.

Hence, we can estimate the characteristic phase speed (sound

speed) in the loop which should satisfy:

C ph ≥

λ
P

≈ 125 ± 11 km/sec.

(3)

Furthermore, as the sound speed depends on temperature, us-
ing the temperature response of SDO/AIA 171 Å and the logic
related to the temperature given in section 2, we claim that

Cs >

(cid:115)

γkBT
˜µmp

= 120 km/sec,

(4)

where µ = 0.6 is the mean molecular mass of hydrogen
plasma. This estimation is in good agreement with our ﬁnd-
ings. Moreover, if we assume the loop L1 to be a semi-circle.
Taking into account the physical properties (the length and the
distance between the foot points), it would be located no higher
than 25 Mm. This indicates that the observed loops are located
in the low corona.

3.2. Kink instability

In this subsection we present an alternative interpretation of the
observed dynamics. Bright blobs along a coronal loop can also
be a signature of twisting of the loop. Srivastava et al. (2010)
showed that the total twist angle related to kink modes can be
obtained by:

Φ = 2πNtwist,

(5)

where, Ntwist is the number of turns over the tube length. At
least ﬁve diﬀerent turns (bright blobs) can be seen along the loop
L1. The loop width varies along it. Applying a Gaussian ﬁtting,
we derived the loop radius. Further, we measured the radius at
four diﬀerent points along the L1 loop during the ﬂare. We then
calculated the mean values for each point. The radius increases
from ∼ 2.3 Mm to ∼ 3.7 Mm (Fig. 10 panel (a)).

We estimated the mean pitch (2πp), that is, the distance be-
tween subsequent turns of the magnetic ﬁeld lines, for each im-
age. The mean pitch decreases from 10.7 Mm to 5.1 Mm along
the loop, but not gradually (see Fig. 10 panel (b)).

As there are ﬁve blobs along the LI loop, the total twist angle

for the L1 loop is approximately:

Φ = 10.0π,

(6)

in the case of homogeneous distribution. This means that the L1
loop is strongly twisted and could be vulnerable to kink insta-
bility, which eventually may lead to a sudden reconnection with
other loops and a consequent M-class ﬂare. In fact, the Kruskal-
Shafranov instability criterion yields Φ > 2.0π. However, for a
large aspect ratio loop, that is, a loop with a large ratio between

11

Philishvili et al.: Quasi-oscillatory dynamics

the loop length and radius, the critical twist angle increases fur-
ther (Baty, 2001). The approximate aspect ratio for the L1 loop,
even for the narrowest part of the loop, is L/a ∼ 18 (for the
widest part we obtain L/a ∼ 11), which is relatively large. A
normal mode analysis for the large aspect ratio case gives the in-
stability criterion a > 2p (Dungey & Loughhead, 1954; Bennett
et al., 1999), which also yields a large twist angle. Figure10(c)
shows that this criterion is only not satisﬁed for the narrowest
part of the loop, close to the L1b foot point. Increasing the radius
along the loop increases the possibility for kink instability to oc-
cur, with the consequent loop interruption. If we assume that the
radius and pitch do not change along the loop and we take mean
values of the radius and pitch, the a/2p > 1 instability criterion
is also satisﬁed for a symmetric cylinder.

ﬂows might play the role of key indicators of the reconnection,
and the related physical background of these processes will be
studied in a separate investigation.

4. Conclusions

We studied the well-resolved single loop shape L1 using the
imaging observations of SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI(6173 Å) and
estimated its length to be ∼ 36 Mm, while the loop half-width
increases from ∼ 2.3 Mm to ∼ 3.7 Mm. From the ﬂare start-
ing time, before the reconnection between the L1 and L2 loops
occurs, we observed ﬁve bright blobs in the loop that show oscil-
latory patterns in intensity. We analyzed time-distance diagrams
along the loop and showed that the blobs do not move. Further,
we performed an intensity variability analysis for each of the
bright blobs and also for the dark points in between them. We
estime the corresponding quasi-periodic oscillation periods to
range from 103 sec to 128 sec for the blobs. We derived the
mean value to be 116 sec. We found that the bright blobs oscil-
late in anti-phase with each of their neighbors and, moreover, we
observed the whitened ridges of intensity connecting the bright
blobs.

According to our ﬁndings, we interpret this event as follows

with two diﬀerent possible scenarios:

We intuitively ascribe the observed oscillations to longitudi-
nal standing acoustic waves. If we take into account the physical
parameters of the loop and the distribution of the bright blobs
along it, we can assume that we see a high harmonic, speciﬁcally
the ﬁfth harmonic, of the standing longitudinal acoustic mode.
We suppose that this high mode can be excited by multiple non-
equilibrium sources due to the strong couplings related to the
rapid change in background temperature and density. Further,
we suggest that the characteristic phase speed that we estimated
is in accordance with the sound speed in the low corona.

Alternatively, we suggest that the bright blobs could also be
the signature of a strongly twisted magnetic loop that is vulnera-
ble to kink instability. We calculated the total twist angle for the
L1 loop for a homogenous distribution and found Φ = 10.0π,
which is much larger than the Kruskal-Shafranov instability cri-
terion that gives Φ > 2.0π. The aspect ratio for the widest part
of the loop is L/a ∼ 11 and for such a large aspect ratio, the in-
stability criterion is given by a > 2p. If we consider the L1 loop
to be a symmetric cylinder, this criterion is easily satisﬁed. We
derived the mean pitch (the distance between subsequent mag-
netic ﬁeld line turns) and their corresponding loop radii for dif-
ferent parts along the loop. As a result, this criterion is satisﬁed
with the increase of the radius, which enhances the kink insta-
bility leading to magnetic reconnection and consequent energy
release. This in turn may have led to the observed M2.1 class
ﬂare.

We also observed a decaying ﬂow with a velocity in the range
60 − 180 km/sec. This ﬂow seemingly indicates the plasma jets
related to the reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. These
