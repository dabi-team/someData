ABSTRACT 

In  the  context  of  high-accuracy  computational  thermochemistry,  the  valence  CCSD  correlation 

component  of  molecular  atomization  energies  present  the  most  severe  basis  set  convergence 

problem, followed by the (T) component. In the present paper, we make a detailed comparison, 

for  an  expanded  version  of  the  W4-11  thermochemistry  benchmark,  between  on  the  one  hand 

1 

 
orbital-based CCSD/AV{5,6}Z+d and CCSD/ACV{5,6}Z extrapolation, and on the other hand 

CCSD-F12b  calculations  with  cc-pVQZ-F12  and  cc-pV5Z-F12  basis  sets.  This  latter  basis  set, 

now  available  for  H–He,  B–Ne,  and  Al–Ar,  is  shown  to  be  very  close  to  the  basis  set  limit. 

Apparent  differences  (which  can  reach  0.35  kcal/mol  for  systems  like  CCl4)  between  orbital-

based  and  CCSD-F12b  basis  set  limits  disappear  if  basis  sets  with  additional  radial  flexibility, 

such as ACV{5,6}Z, are used for the orbital calculation. Counterpoise calculations reveal that, 

while  TAEs  with  V5Z-F12  basis  sets  are  nearly  free  of  BSSE,  orbital  calculations  have 

significant BSSE even with AV(6+d)Z basis sets, leading to non-negligible differences between 

raw  and  counterpoise-corrected  extrapolated  limits.  This  latter  problem  is  greatly  reduced  by 

switching to ACV{5,6}Z core-valence basis sets, or simply adding an additional zeta to just the 

valence  orbitals.  Previous  reports  that  all-electron  approaches  like  HEAT  lead  to  different 

CCSD(T) limits than "valence limit+CV correction” approaches like FPD and W4 theory can be 

rationalized  in  terms  of  the  greater  radial  flexibility  of  core-valence  basis  sets.  For  (T) 

corrections, conventional CCSD(T)/AV{Q,5}Z+d calculations are found to be superior to scaled 

or  extrapolated  CCSD(T)-F12b  calculations  of  similar  cost.  For  a  W4-F12  protocol,  we 

recommend obtaining the SCF and valence CCSD components from CCSD-F12b/cc-pV{Q,5}Z-

F12  calculations,  but  the  (T)  component  from  conventional  CCSD(T)/aug’-cc-pV{Q,5}Z+d 

calculations  using  Schwenke’s  extrapolation;  post-CCSD(T),  core-valence,  and  relativistic 

corrections  are  to  be  obtained  as  in  the  original  W4  theory.  W4-F12  is  found  to  agree  slightly 

better than W4 with ATcT (active thermochemical tables) data, at a substantial saving in CPU 

time and especially I/O overhead. A W4-F12 calculation on benzene is presented as a proof of 

concept.

Introduction 

Computational  thermochemistry  is  a  cornerstone  of  computational  chemistry,  and  molecular 

total atomization energies (TAEs, or their cognates, molecular heats of formation) are the most 

fundamental thermochemical properties of molecules. 

A number of composite ab initio thermochemistry schemes (for reviews see Refs.1–5) has been 

developed that strive to yield such properties with ‘chemical accuracy’ (traditionally defined as 1 

kcal/mol).  These include the Gaussian-n methods such as G3 and G4,3,6 the CBS approaches of 

the  Wesleyan  U.  group,7,8  and  the  ccCA  approach  of  Wilson  and  coworkers,9–11  as  well  as 

Weizmann-1  (W1)  theory12–14    and  its  variants.15–17  (We  note  here  that  the  term  ‘theory’, 

originally introduced for the ‘Gn theory’ family by the Pople group and followed by other groups 

such as that at Weizmann, is somewhat infelicitous and that terms like ‘prescription’, ‘approach’, 

or ‘protocol’ would be more appropriate: this ‘theory’ usage is followed here only for historical 

reasons.) 

For more accurate calculations, there are approaches such as Weizmann-4 (W4) theory,18,19 the 

HEAT  approach,20,21  and  the  Feller-Peterson-Dixon  (FPD)  approach.22–26  The  stated  goal  here 

(e.g., of W4 theory18) is three-sigma accuracy of 1 kJ/mol (0.24 kcal/mol) for small molecules: in 

the  event  W4  calculations  would  become  technically  feasible  on  medium-to-large  size 

molecules, a modified goal of 3σ=0.24 kcal/mol per (single or multiple) bond would presumably 

be more realistic. 

In an idealized scenario, quantum chemists would be able to calculate the total atomization 

energy of a molecule relativistically, and including diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections at 

the FCI (full configuration interaction) or at least CCSDTQ (coupled cluster27 with all single, 

double, triple, and quadruple substitutions) level near the 1-particle basis set limit, and 

3 

 
correlating all inner-shell as well as valence electrons. In the real world, the ‘scaling wall’ of 

high-level correlated methods such as CCSDTQ — for which the CPU time requirements 

asymptotically scale as O(n4N6), n being the number of electrons and N the number of basis 

functions — make such calculations impossible for all but the smallest systems. 

Instead, high-level composite ab initio methods such as W4 theory, FPD, and HEAT rely on 

decompositions such as: 

TAE e = TAE[CCSD(T)] + TAE[T3-(T)] + TAE[T4 ] + TAE[T 5 ] + TAE[rel.] + TAE[SO] + TAE[DBOC] 

in which TAEe represents the total atomization energy of the molecule in the hypothetical 

motionless state (“at the bottom of the well”) and the right-hand terms are, respectively, the  all-

electron CCSD(T)28,29 atomization energy, the (usually repulsive) correction for higher-order 

connected triple excitations T3, the (universally attractive) correction for connected quadruple 

excitations T4, that of connected quintuple and higher excitations T5, the scalar relativistic 

correction, the spin-orbit coupling correction, and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. 

∆TAE[DBOC] is negligible for heavy-atom systems, and quite small even for hydrogen 

compounds: for benzene, it reaches 0.14 kcal/mol.30 

For a closed-shell molecule, ∆TAE[SO] is just a sum of small atomic spin-orbit splittings. 

∆TAE[rel] is quite small for 1st and 2nd row molecules, reaching about 2 kcal/mol for such 

ststems as SiF4 31 and SO3 32 but typically being a fraction of that. Electron correlation does have 

the effect12,33,34 of reducing the relativistic correction by about 20%: the cross-coupling with 

higher-order correlation effects is negligible. 

For systems dominated by a single reference determinant, the higher-order correlation terms 

TAE[T3–(T)]+TAE[T4]+TAE[T5] largely cancel, while even for molecules like ozone, their 

4 

 
 
 
contribution is no larger than a few kcal/mol.18,19 Their basis set convergence has been studied in 

some detail.19 For the T3–(T) and T4 terms, basis set convergence in terms of the maximum 

angular momentum L was found19 to be similar to the leading L–3 behavior seen for the overall 

correlation energy.35–37 For higher substitution levels, not only do the contributions rapidly decay 

but their basis set convergence becomes ever faster.19 The T5 contribution, for example, is 

already captured adequately by an unpolarized double-zeta basis set --- apparently these high 

connected excitation levels primarily reflect static rather than dynamical correlation. (See also 

Ref.38 for a more detailed discussion.) This is fortunate in view of the ever-steeper computational 

cost scaling of these terms. 

This leaves us with TAE[CCSD(T)] as the main objective, with an asymptotic O(n3N4) cost 

scaling. In the HEAT approach, no further decomposition is made, and inner-shell electrons are 

correlated throughout. For first-row systems, this does not entail a severe computational 

premium, but for molecules with several second-row atoms such as P4 or AlCl3, the additional 

CPU cost and resource overhead of correlating the inner-shell electrons quickly makes the 

calculation intractable, especially in light of the need to use core-valence basis sets throughout. 

In W4 theory (and generally also FPD), a further decomposition is introduced: 

TAE[CCSD(T)] = TAE[SCF] + TAE[CCSD,valence] + TAE[(T ),valence] + TAE[CCSD(T),core-valence]  

where the respective terms are the CCSD (coupled cluster with all singles and doubles39) valence 

correlation energy, the quasiperturbative contribution of connected triple excitations (see 

references for the quasi-fourth-order40 and quasi-fifth-order28 terms, and for the open-shell 

generalization29), and the differential inner-shell correlation contribution. The latter is dominated 

by the core-valence terms as the core-core correlation largely cancels between the molecule and 

5 

 
 
 
the separated atoms.41 Its contributions are on the order of a few kcal/mol for typical first-and 

second-row molecules:12,34,42 Its basis set convergence has been studied in some detail and the 

conclusion was reached that extrapolation from triple- and quadruple-zeta core-valence basis sets 

captures the basis set limit to within a few hundredths of a kcal/mol. (We shall briefly revisit this 

issue in the Results and Discussion section.) 

This leaves as the two largest terms the SCF and valence CCSD correlation terms, the valence 

(T) term typically being an order of magnitude smaller than the CCSD correlation term.  

Out of these, basis set convergence for the SCF term is comparatively rapid (see, e.g., Ref.43). 

Thus, the CCSD valence correlation energy can be singled out as the term that typically limits 

accuracy of ab initio thermochemical calculations. It will be the principal focus of our discussion. 

Approaches such as W4 and HEAT entail extrapolation (joint in HEAT, layered in W4) to the 

CCSD(T)  limit  with  basis  sets  as  large  as  aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z44–46  owing  to  the  slow  basis  set 

convergence  of  the  correlation  energy.35–37  In  the  FPD  approach,  basis  sets  as  large  as  aug-cc-

pV8Z  and  aug-cc-pV9Z  have  been  used.26,47    The  requirements  of  these  latter  calculations,  in 

terms  of  computation  power  and  especially  resources,  make  them  prime  candidates  for 

convergence acceleration by means of explicitly correlated methods.48–55 Such methods, in which 

“geminal”  terms  that  explicitly  depend  on  the  interelectronic  distance  have  been  added  to  the 

orbital  basis  set,    typically  gain  their  users  2–3  basis  set  “zetas”  over  their  conventional 

counterparts. 56–58   

Alas, 

the  use  of  explicitly  correlated  methods 

for  high-accuracy  computational 

thermochemistry met with mixed success in the work of the present authors15,24,59,60 and others.61,62 

While F12 methods enable rapidly reaching the vicinity of the basis set limit, approaching more 

closely in a consistent way proved a greater challenge. For instance, as will also be seen in this 

6 

 
paper, basis set convergence of CCSD-F12 TAEs from F12 methods can be oscillatory or even 

(anomalously)  monotonically  decreasing,  unlike  the  monotonically  increasing  behavior  in 

conventional calculations. 

Correlation  consistent  basis  sets44–46    have  become  something  of  a  de  facto  standard  for 

conventional  ab  initio  calculations,  but  may  not  be  the  most  suitable  choice  for  explicitly 

correlated  ones.  In  response,  a  team  involving  one  of  us  developed  the  cc-pVnZ-F12  and  cc-

pCVnZ-F12  basis  sets63–65  (n  =  D,  T,  Q),  which  were  optimized  at  the  MP2-F12  level  in  the 

presence  of  the  appropriate  geminal  terms.  These  basis  sets  do  appear  to  have  smoother 

convergence behavior, though basis set extrapolation was still found to be necessary.66  

Very recently, a cc-pV5Z-F12 basis set for the first row elements H, He, and B–Ne has been 

published.67  This  basis  set  was  shown  to  be  very  close  to  the  basis  set  limit,  and  it  has  proven 

useful in benchmarking applications involving noncovalent interactions.67–69,70  

Application  to  general  thermochemistry,  such  as  a  putative  W4-F12  theory,  would  require 

expansion  of  the  cc-pV5Z-F12  basis  set  to  second  row  elements,  as  well  as  careful  validation 

against a comparatively large and diverse benchmark, such as W4-11.42  

In the process of doing so, we initially found discrepancies that appeared to suggest that CCSD 

and CCSD-F12b converge to different basis set limits. Upon further exploration, reported in the 

present paper, we found that the discrepancy was an artifact of inadequate radial flexibility of the 

conventional valence basis sets.

Selection of the molecules

We started with the W4-11 set.42 We removed the three beryllium-containing compounds from 

the list and added the following 14 species: C2Cl2, HC2Cl, CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3 (chloroform), 

CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride), FNO, ClNO, COCl2 (phosgene), CF2Cl2 (Freon-12), CHF3, C2H3Cl, 

C2H5Cl, and CH3CONH2 (formamide). For all of these, we were able to obtain CCSD-F12b 

results through aug-cc-pwCV5Z, as well as conventional CCSD results with various augmented 

basis set combinations. This extended W4-11 dataset, now totaling 151 molecules, will be 

denoted as W4-15 throughout. 

		For a subset of 28 first-row systems, denoted TAE28,67 we previously (in the framework of 

Ref.67) obtained CCSD-F12b data with a large sdpfgh reference basis set (denoted REF-h),66 as 

well as truncations of the same at f and g functions (REF-f and REF-g, respectively). Triple 

excitation contributions were obtained from conventional CCSD(T) through REF-i (i.e., adding 

four i functions to the REF-h basis set). The molecules in question are: BF, BH3, BH, BN, C2H2, 

C2H4, C2, CF2, CH2NH, CH4, CO2, CO, F2O, F2, H2CO, H2O2, H2O, H2, HCN, HF, HNC, HNO, 

HOF, N2O, N2, NH3, O3, and CH2(1A1). In the present work, we are expanding TAE28 to the 

TAE42 set by adding in 14 second-row molecules, namely Cl2, ClF, P2, SiO, AlF, AlCl, CS, HCl, 

H2S,  PH3, ClCN, OCS, HOCl, and SO2. 

Computational details 

Most  calculations  were  carried  out  using  MOLPRO  2012.171  running  on  the  Faculty  of 

Chemistry  HPC  cluster  at  the  Weizmann  Institute  of  Science.  Post-CCSD(T)  correlation 

calculations  are  reported  for  some  systems  (notably  benzene):  these  were  obtained  using  the 

MRCC  program  of  Kallay  and  coworkers72    running  on  a  cluster  at  the  University  of  Western 

Australia. 

8 

 
 
For  the  cc-pVnZ-F12  correlation  consistent  basis  sets  (n  =  D,  T,  Q)  optimized  for  F12 

calculations,63 we employed the auxiliary basis sets73 and CABS (complementary auxiliary basis 

sets)74  developed for use with them, as well as the Weigend75,76  JK-fitting basis sets which are 

the MOLPRO default. The SCF component was improved through the “CABS correction”. 54,77  

For the cc-pVnZ-F12 basis set sequence, we have considered two ways of choosing the geminal 

exponents β: one the recommended66 (rather than Ref.63) MP2-F12/3C(fix) optimized values of β 

=  0.9  for  cc-pVDZ-F12,66    1.0  for  cc-pVxZ-F12  (x  =  T,  Q),66  and  1.2  for  cc-pV5Z-F12;67  the 

other choice being β = 1.4 throughout, as is customary with large basis sets.  It appears (Table 1; 

see also Ref.67 and discussion below) that using β = 1.4 throughout leads to more rapid basis set 

convergence  at  the  CCSD-F12b  level.  It  matters  very  little  for  the  extrapolated  V{Q,5}Z-F12 

values,  which  are  within  0.007  kcal/mol  RMSD  of  each  other  for  the  TAE42  set,  and  RMSD 

from the reference data is 0.014-5 kcal/mol in both cases, even if the MSD does drop from 0.004 

to 0.000 kcal/mol. By way of perspective: the TAE42 reference data were obtained from REF-g 

and  REF-h  basis  sets,78  the  extrapolation  covering  just  0.015  kcal/mol  RMS.  For  the 

unextrapolated  V5Z-F12  basis  set,  however,  the  RMSD  drops  from  0.036  to  0.023  kcal/mol 

when  β  =  1.4  is  chosen,  while  for  VQZ-F12,  we  see  a  more  significant  lowering  from  0.14  to 

0.07 kcal/mol.

For some systems, we also applied a large even-tempered uncontracted spdfgh reference basis 

set  proposed  in  Ref.78,  and  used  in  previous  work  by  Peterson  and  coworkers:79  we  use  the

notation REF-f for its truncation at f functions, and similarly REF-g, and REF-h. For the REF-h 

basis set and its truncations, we availed ourselves of very large uncontracted auxiliary basis sets 

previously  reported  in  Ref.66.  For  the  V5Z-F12  basis  set,  we  employed  the  combination  of 

Weigend’s aug-cc-pV5Z/JKFIT basis set76 for the Coulomb and exchange elements with Hättig’s 

aug-cc-pwCV5Z/MP2FIT basis set80 for both the RI-MP2 parts and for the CABS.  

For  comparison,  some  F12  calculations  were  run  with  ordinary  aug-cc-pVnZ  basis  sets,81 

where the JKFIT basis set76 was extended by a single even-tempered layer of diffuse functions, 

RI-MP2 basis set was again taken from Ref. 80 but the CABS basis sets of Yousaf and Peterson 82 

were employed.  

The primary explicitly correlated method considered in this work is CCSD(T)-F12b,  54,55 with 

various forms of scaling for the connected triples. In a previous study (Ref.67; see also Ref.68), we 

considered  CCSD(F12*)  (a.k.a.,  CCSD-F12c)83    instead  of  CCSD-F12b,  and  found  that  the 

difference between the two approaches is only significant for the cc-pVDZ-F12 basis set, which 

is manifestly inadequate for molecular atomization energies.  

Basis  set  extrapolations  for  conventional  calculations  were  carried  out  using  Schwenke’s 

expression84 for CCSD and (T), while for explicitly correlated calculations we used the formulas 

from Ref.78 For comparison, we also applied the original W4 scheme, in which separate L–3 and 

L–5  extrapolations  are  used  as  advocated  by  Klopper46;  in  this  scheme,  the  distribution  of 

opposite-spin,  spin-up,  and  spin-down  correlation  energies  to  S  and  T  pairs  is  not  unique  for 

open-shell systems. We followed the convention from Ref.85: it was found (see below) that this 

did not offer an advantage over Schwenke’s formula, which does not require such a separation. 

F12  approaches  as  presently  practiced  do  not  directly  affect  the  connected  quasiperturbative 

triples,  so  the  basis  set  convergence  behavior  of  the  (T)  contribution  is  effectively  that  of  a 

11 

 
conventional calculation. Marchetti and Werner86 proposed convergence acceleration by scaling 

the  (T)  contribution  by  the  MP2-F12/MP2  correlation  energy  ratio,  and  found  that  this 

considerably improves calculated interaction energies for noncovalent complexes. Such scaling 

will  be  indicated  by  the  notation  (T*)  instead  of  (T).  If  practiced  separately  on  molecule  and 

separate  atoms,  this  practice  is  not  size-consistent:  Marchetti  and  Werner  suggested  using  the 

molecule/dimer  ratio  for  all  species,  restoring  size  consistency  —  which  we  indicate  by  the 

suffix “sc” in (T*sc). In two recent studies,68,69 we found (T*) to be beneficial for F12 harmonic 

frequency  calculations  and  for  noncovalent  interaction  energies69  as  well.  However,  for 

atomization  energies,  Feller87 

recently  performed  a  comparison  of  CCSD(T*)-F12b,  

extrapolated  CCSD(T)-F12b  and  standard  CCSD(T)  with  large  basis  sets  for  a  test  set  of  212 

molecules.  He found (T*) performed well for small basis sets due to a fortuitous cancellation of 

errors  between  underestimating  CCSD(corr.)  and  overestimating  (T),  a  balance  which 

disappeared  with  the  large  cc-pV5Z-F12(rev  2)  basis  set:    Overall,  CCSD(T*)  provided  no 

advantage  over  extrapolated  CCSD(T)-F12b.  In  a  very  recent  revision70  of  the  S66x8 

noncovalent  interaction  benchmark,88  we  found  that  the  overestimate  is  mitigated  by  using  the 

Ecorr[CCSD-F12b]/Ecorr[CCSD] correlation energy ratio instead, which we denote by the symbol 

(Tb),  or  (Tbsc)  for  the  size-consistent  variant.  In  the  original  cc-pV5Z-F12  paper,67  we  instead 

proposed (Ts), which consists of multiplying (T) by a uniform scaling factor specific to the basis 

set, optimized against REF-{h,i} extrapolated values for the TAE28 set: The scaling factors thus 

obtained67 are 1.1413 for VDZ-F12, 1.0527 for VTZ-F12, 1.0232 for VQZ-F12, and 1.0131 for 

V5Z-F12rev2. Generally, one observes ∆TAE(T) < ∆TAE(Ts) < ∆TAE(Tbsc) < ∆TAE(T*sc).  

The MP2-F12 correlation energies discussed are those obtained with the 3C ansatz53 with fixed 

amplitudes,51 a.k.a. “3C(Fix)”.

Unless noted otherwise, the “frozen core” approximation was applied, i.e., all inner-shell orbitals 

were constrained to be doubly occupied. 

Conventional  orbital-based  SCF,  CCSD,  CCSD(T)  results  were  obtained  using  the  aug-cc-

pV(5+d)Z81,89 and aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z89–91 basis sets (AV5Z and AV6Z for short), as well as with 

aug-cc-pCV5Z41,92 and aug-cc-pCV6Z64,93 core-valence basis sets (ACV5Z and ACV6Z for short) 

and  the  core-valence-weighted  aug-cc-pwCVQZ  and  aug-cc-pwCV5Z  basis  sets.41  In  the 

conventional calculations, we omitted diffuse functions on hydrogen, a practice which has been 

adopted  often  in  the  past  and  variously  denoted  aug’-cc-pVnZ,94  jul-cc-pVnZ,95  haVnZ,88  or 

heavy-aug-cc-pVnZ (e.g.,96).  No such omission was made in the F12 calculations with ordinary 

aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets, which were carried out purely for comparison purposes. 

In addition, we considered what we will denote AVn+1Zt basis sets, which are basis sets of the 

next zeta level from which the top angular momentum has been truncated. The AV5+1Zh basis 

set  corresponds  to  aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z  with  the  i  functions  deleted  (i.e.,  retaining  at  most  h 

functions),  while  AV6+1Zi  was  derived  from  the  aug-cc-pV(7+d)Z  basis  set97–99  with  the  k 

functions    removed.  This  constitutes  an  additional  check  of  the  effect  of  enhancing  radial 

flexibility of the basis set (see Results and Discussion). 

For benchmark conventional CCSD(T) calculations, which require no auxiliary basis sets, we 

also expanded the REF-h set with four additional i functions66 to obtain the REF-i basis set. 

Basis set optimization 

The  development  of  the  new  cc-pV5Z-F12  orbital  basis  sets  for  Al–Ar  was  similar  to  the 

previous optimizations of the n = D–Q sets.63 In the present work the s and p portions of the basis 

13 

 
 
sets  were  simply  taken  from  the  standard  contracted  aug-cc-pV6Z  basis  sets.90  Higher  angular 

momentum  correlating  functions  optimized  for  the  MP2-F12/3C(D)  total  energy53  were  then 

added to these HF sets, i.e., (6d4f3g2h). In each case the exponents were constrained to follow 

an  even-tempered  sequence,  except  for  the  tightest  d  and  f  functions,  which  were  freely 

optimized as in the original cc-pVnZ-F12 optimizations.63 In contrast however to the cc-pV5Z-

F12 sets for B–Ne, the correlating functions of this work were optimized for the ground states of 

the atoms instead of the homonuclear diatomics. This was only a matter of convenience and was 

not expected to affect the quality of the resulting basis sets, particularly for one of this size. For 

consistency with Ref.63, all optimizations employed a geminal exponent of 1.4 with the reference 

DF and RI basis sets of Ref.66. (This choice of the geminal exponent keeps the optimized orbital 

exponents  somewhat  more  diffuse  so  that  the  F12  factor  covers  the  short  range  correlation, 

leaving the basis set to take care of the long range.) 

The geminal exponent β was optimized at the MP2-F12 level for the new cc-pV5Z-F12 sets 

according to the same procedure as in Ref. 66 and was found to be β = 1.2. 

Results	and	discussion	

Calibration against TAE42 

In  Table  1,  we  present  error  statistics  for  the  TAE42  dataset,  compared  to  basis  set  limits 

extrapolated  from  large,  uncontracted  spdfg  and  spdfgh  basis  sets  proposed  in  Ref.78  (denoted 

REF-g  and  REF-h  for  short).  The  basis  set  limit  was  obtained  by  extrapolation  using  the 

theoretical Lmax

–7 dependence derived by Kutzelnigg.37 As it bridges just 0.015 kcal/mol RMS, it 

is  deemed  adequate  for  our  purposes.  A  conservative  estimate  for  the  uncertainty  on  the  REF-

{g.h} limits would be about 0.01 kcal/mol RMS 

14 

 
 
Extrapolation from V{Q,5}Z-F12 yields results of nearly the same quality as REF-h, RMSD = 

0.014  kcal/mol  with  β  =  1.4  ,  or  0.015  kcal/mol  with  ‘optimal’  geminal  exponents.  The  raw 

VTZ-F12, VQZ-F12, and V5Z-F12 results are unquestionably closer to the basis set limit with β 

= 1.4 than with the MP2-F12 optimized β. Previous attempts to optimize geminal exponents at 

the  CCSD-F12b  level  led  to  unrealistically  high  β  values  (see,  e.g.,  p.8  of  Ref.78).  We  showed 

previously67  for  REF-h  and  for  cc-pV5Z-F12  that  with  sufficiently  large  basis  sets,  the 

dependence of the correlation energy on the geminal exponent is weak enough that optimization 

of β becomes pretty much irrelevant: for CCSD-F12b or CCSD(F12*) calculations in cc-pVTZ-

F12 or especially cc-pVQZ-F12 basis sets — where β = 1.4 cuts the error in half, from RMSD = 

0.136 to 0.069 kcal/mol — setting β = 1.4 may be a sensible choice. 

CCSD-F12b/awCV5Z yields results of nearly the same quality as REF-h. However, unlike the 

VnZ-F12 series in which basis set convergence is monotonic, CCSD-F12b/awCVQZ TAEs can 

be larger than their CCSD-F12b/awCV5Z counterparts.  

Using  CCSD-F12b  with  conventional  AV(n+d)Z  basis  sets  yields  not  only  non-monotonic 

convergence — AV(Q+d)Z and AV(5+d)Z actually overbind, on average — but even the costly 

AV(5+d)Z basis set still leaves an RMSD = 0.074 kcal/mol. AV{Q,5}Z extrapolation does cut 

this  figure  almost  in  half,  but  V{Q,5}Z-F12  clearly  outperforms  it,  at  comparable  or  lower 

computational cost.  

Turning  now  to  conventional  CCSD  calculations,  the  standard  W4  extrapolation  procedure 

employed  in  the  W4-11  paper  yields  RMSD  =  0.08  kcal/mol,  with  a  clear  underestimate  on 

average  (MSD  =  –0.05  kcal/mol).  Switching  to  joint  extrapolation  using  Schwenke’s  formula 

15 

 
(and hence eliminating the ambiguity as to how to partition the open-shell correlation energies 

between S and T pairs) actually somewhat reduces RMSD to 0.06 kcal/mol.   

Substituting ACV{5,6}Z core-valence basis sets, however, reduces both systematic and RMSD 

error,  the  latter  to  0.045  kcal/mol.  Using  AVn+1Z  basis  sets  from  which  the  top  angular 

momentum  has  been  removed  (denoted  AV6Zh  and  AV7Zi  in  the  table)  actually  yields  a 

statistically equivalent RMSD of 0.043 kcal/mol. This suggests that the issue is related to greater 

radial flexibility in these basis sets. In order to verify whether this results primarily from more 

flexible  valence  orbitals,  or  also  from  the  availability  of  additional  polarization  functions,  we 

carried out an additional set of calculations in which AVn+1Z basis set for s and p orbitals (for 

H,  just  s  orbitals)  was  combined  with  the  ordinary  AVnZ  basis  set  for  the  remaining  angular 

momenta.  This  yields  essentially  the  same  performance,  confirming  that  insufficient  radial 

flexibility in the valence angular momenta of the AVnZ basis sets is the primary culprit. 

For V{Q,5}Z-F12, we obtain essentially the same results whether we use β = 1.4 throughout or 

the recommended66 geminal exponent sequence: 1.0, 1.0, 1.2 for n = T, Q, 5, respectively. For 

the  smaller  basis  sets,  β  =  1.4  greatly  reduces  the  systematic  error.  In  addition,  especially  for 

VQZ-F12, β = 1.4 causes a fairly dramatic improvement in relative terms (from RMSD = 0.134 

to 0.057 kcal/mol).  

V{T,Q}Z-F12  extrapolation  can  achieve  RMSD  =  0.05  kcal/mol  with  either  extrapolation 

sequence, but the systematic error is somewhat smaller with the “optimal” sequence.  

The	complete	W4-15	set	

Let us now turn to larger datasets, namely the 137-member W4-11 and its expanded version 

W4-15  containing  151  molecules  with  up  to  five  non-hydrogen  atoms.  Here,  we  use  cc-

For  the  entire  W4-11  set,  we  find  an  RMSD  between  orbital-based  AV{5,6}Z  values  and 

V{Q,5}Z-F12 of 0.10 kcal/mol, on average systematically underestimated by 0.06 kcal/mol. The 

RMSD  can  in  fact  be  reduced  to  0.08  kcal/mol  by  employing  Schwenke’s  joint  extrapolation, 

which  removes  the  ambiguity  over  the  S-  and  T-pair  distribution.  However,  the  systematic 

underestimate  remains,  and  in  fact  the  RMSD  goes  up  again  to  0.10  kcal/mol  if  the  additional

species  are  included.  Differences  are  especially  large  for  polychlorides:  one  particularly 

instructive  example  is  CCl4  (Table  3),  where  AV{5,6}Z  differs  by  -0.36  kcal/mol  from  our 

V{Q,5}Z-F12  limit,  which  is  within  0.03  kcal/mol  from  awCV5Z  and  0.01  kcal/mol  from  the 

ACV{5,6}Z extrapolation. One sees the same to a lesser extent for polyfluorides. Switching to 

core-valence  basis  sets  for  the  extrapolation  cuts  the  RMSD  to  0.056  kcal/mol  even  for  the 

expanded W4-15 set, and the systematic bias to just -0.023  kcal/mol. Results of a similar quality 

can  be  obtained  with  truncated  AV6Zh/AV7Zi  basis  sets,  or  indeed  with  AVnZ  basis  sets  in 

which just the valence angular momenta were replaced by their AVn+1Z counterparts.

What  about  CCSD-F12b/awCV5Z?  The  RMSD  with  V{Q,5}Z-F12  is  just  under  0.02 

kcal/mol,  buttressing  the  case  for  our  V{Q,5}Z-F12  reference  values.  Average  difference  is 

just -0.01 kcal/mol.  

Had we used unextrapolated V5Z-F12 results as is, that would have led to an RMSD = 0.04 

kcal/mol and an average underestimate by almost the same amount.  

18 

 
 
 
In  contrast,  using  the  original  AV5Z  basis  set  in  conjunction  with  CCSD-F12b  yields  an 

RMSD of about 0.1 kcal/mol, with a systematic overestimate by almost that amount. AV{Q,5}Z 

extrapolation reduces this to 0.07 kcal/mol, with still an average overestimate.  

Finally,  we  note  in  passing  that  the  use  of  the  V5Z-F12  basis  sets,  without  the  additional 

polarization functions on hydrogen that are included in V5Z-F12rev2, incurs an RMSD of 0.019 

kcal/mol. The additional basis functions on hydrogen cause changes as large as 0.08 kcal/mol for 

propane.  As  in  the  original  V5Z-F12  paper,67  we  argue  that  the  additional  basis  functions  are 

strongly recommended for high-accuracy thermochemical work, even as they were found to be 

surplus  to  the  requirements  for  noncovalent  interactions67  and  to  mainly  cause  near-linear 

dependence issues there.  

Basis set superposition error in atomization energies 

In  an  attempt  to  rationalize  the  above  findings,  Table  4  presents  calculated  counterpoise 

corrections  for  the  dissociation  energies  of  N2,  F2,  P2,  S2,  Cl2,  and  CO2  with  various  basis  set 

sequences.  For  the  CO2  triatomic,  the  site-site  function  counterpoise  method  of  Wells  and 

Wilson100 was employed, i.e., the counterpoise-corrected atomization energy of CO2 was taken as 

2E[O(C)(O)]+E[(O)C(O)]-E[CO2], where parentheses indicate ghost atoms.  

A  number  of  observations  can  be  made  here.  First  of  all,  in  non-extrapolated  orbital-based 

calculations, the counterpoise corrections are chemically nontrivial even with basis sets as large 

as AV(6+d)Z.

A positive CP contribution at the basis set limit means the CP-corrected limit is more binding than the CP-uncorrected one. 

We note that in the F12 calculations, the AVnZ results carry very nontrivial HF+CABS BSSEs (unlike VnZ-F12) 

20 

 
 
 
Second,  while  in  principle  extrapolation  to  the  complete  basis  set  limit  should  lead  to  a 

vanishing  counterpoise  correction,  this  is  manifestly  not  the  case  for  the  second-row  species 

(especially Cl2) with the AVnZ sequence.  

Third, in the explicitly correlated calculations, cc-pV5Z-F12, in contrast, does have essentially 

negligible CP corrections, much unlike AV5Z when used in that context. We add that, while the 

BSSEs for the SCF (i.e., HF+CABS) components in the cc-pVnZ-F12 series quickly taper off to 

essentially zero, this is emphatically not the case for the AVnZ series.  

Fourth, coming back to conventional calculations, the alternative basis set sequences ACVnZ 

and AV6Zh/AV7Zi, i.e., the AVn+1Z basis sets with the top angular momentum deleted, suffer 

noticeably less from the issue. What these two sequences have in common, for the purposes of a 

valence calculation, is enhanced radial flexibility. Much of the benefit is recovered, as is seen at 

the bottom of Table 4, by simply using AVn+1Z for the valence angular momenta in conjunction 

with AVnZ for the remainder — i.e., by adding a zeta to the valence orbitals. 

SCF component and core-valence separation 

SCF  limits  for  the  W4-15  dataset  were  established  by  Karton-Martin  extrapolation43  from 

ACV5Z  and  ACV6Z  results.    RMS  deviations  for  various  basis  sets  in  conventional  and 

explicitly correlated (HF+CABS) calculations are summarized in Table 5.  

As can be seen there, the HF components for the ACVnZ series converge quite rapidly, with 

ACV5Z  already  within  0.01  kcal/mol  RMS  and  the  extrapolation  accounting  for  post-ACV6Z 

expansion amounting to just 0.002 kcal/mol RMS. HF+CABS/VQZ-F12 is already quite close at 

21 

 
 
 
RMSD=0.016 kcal/mol,  while HF+CABS/V5Z-F12 is essentially converged with respect to the 

orbital basis set at RMSD=0.003 kcal/mol.

In contrast, HF/AV(5+d)Z still has an RMSD of 0.10 kcal/mol (individual errors reaching 0.6 

kcal/mol for SO3), and even for HF/AV(6+d)Z an RMSD = 0.021 kcal/mol remains. There has 

been  some  discussion  between  the  W4  and  HEAT  groups  as  to  the  reasons  for  the  difference 

between joint all-electron CCSD(T) extrapolation using core-valence basis sets (as practiced in 

HEAT)  and  the  layered  extrapolation  of  SCF,  CCSD,  and  (T)  using  valence  basis  sets, 

augmented with core-valence corrections. This difference can be decomposed into three terms: 

TAE[CCSD(T,all)/ACVnZ]–TAE[CCSD(T,val)/AVnZ] 

= 

TAE[CCSD(T,all)/ACVnZ] 

–TAE[CCSD(T,val)/ACVnZ]+TAE[CCSD(T,val)/ACVnZ]–TAE[CCSD(T,val)/AVnZ] 

=TAE[CV]+{TAEcorr[CCSD(T,val)/ACVnZ]–TAEcorr[CCSD(T,val)/ACVnZ]} 

+{TAE [HF/ACVnZ]- TAEcorr[HF/AVnZ]} 

where  the  first  term,  TAE[CV],  represents  the  core-valence  correction  proper  (calculated 

separately in W4 theory), the second terms is the change in the valence correlation terms due to 

the  more  flexible  basis  set,  and  the  third  term  the  effect  of  this  basis  sets  expansion  on  the 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hartree-Fock component. Based on the present results in Tables 2 and 5, we are prepared to say 

that  the  difference  is  primarily  due  to  the  improved  valence  correlation  term  resulting  from 

additional  radial  flexibility,  with  the  additional  HF  relaxation  energy  a  secondary  factor..  We 

note that these latter two terms are included implicitly in ccCA11 through the technique of taking 

the CV correction as the difference between a core-valence calculation in a CV basis set and a 

valence calculation in a valence set. 

As  seen  in  the  previous  subsection,  the  SCF  component  is  not  the  whole  story.  Detailed 

comparison between TAEcorr,val[CCSD] for AV(6+d)Z and ACV6Z basis sets reveals differences 

reaching  up  to  0.1  kcal/mol,  with  the  core-valence  basis  set  yielding  less  binding,  owing  to 

reduced basis set superposition error. Between AV(5+d)Z and ACV5Z, the differences are much 

larger, reaching 0.3 kcal/mol for CCl4 and 0.24 kcal/mol for CF4, again, due to reduced BSSE. 

The Schwenke-style extrapolation is incapable of reducing the AV{n-1,n}Z BSSE to the desired 

level:  0.09  kcal/mol  remains  for  CF4,  0.25  kcal/mol  for  AlCl3,  0.15  kcal/mol  for  Cl2O,  0.12 

kcal/mol for Cl2, 0.23 kcal/mol for CF2Cl2, and a whopping 0.39 kcal/mol for CCl4. We note that 

in  all  these  cases,  the  V{Q,5}Z-F12  limit  or  the  raw  V5Z-F12  results  are  closer  to  the 

ACV{5,6}Z answer than to the AV{5,6}Z+d one.  

Finally, the question remains how well the core-valence correlation contributions themselves 

can be captured.  

For a subset of 63 molecules, we calculated core-valence correlation contributions at the 

CCSD(T)/ACVnZ level (n=T,Q,5,6). The ACV{5,6}Z extrapolated values were used as a 

primary standard. RMS deviations using smaller basis sets are given in Table 6.

REFERENCE 

As can be seen above, the CCSD(T)/aug’-cc-pwCV{T,Q}Z level used for that contribution in 

W4 theory captures the basis set limits to within 0.02 kcal/mol RMS. The statistics are actually 

somewhat worsened by especially poor performance for some Al and Si hydrides: for Si2H6, for 

instance, the awCV{T,Q}Z and awCV{Q,5}Z limits differ by 0.10 kcal/mol. Further inspection 

revealed that the extrapolations were skewed by especially poor performance of the awCVTZ 

basis sets: the ACV{T,Q}Z  sets did not have the problem. Further analysis of the basis sets 

revealed that the inner-shell f correlation functions in awCVTZ has such a small exponent (the 

better to describe core-valence correlation) that it leaves the basis set insufficient to describe 

core-core correlation. 

At any rate, awCV{Q,5}Z calculations should put that issue to rest in the event that this level of 

accuracy is required. 
The effect of higher-order inner-shell correlation was briefly touched upon in Ref.19. It is 

effectively nil for systems dominated by dynamical correlation but can reach the 0.1-0.2 

kcal/mol regime for molecules with pathological nondynamical correlation such as singlet C2 and 

24 

 
 
 
 
BN. They are considered in W4.4 theory, at great computational expense that effectively puts 

applications beyond very small systems out of reach. 

Connected triple excitations, (T) corrections  

In contrast, as summarized in Table 6, the corresponding differences for the (T) term are small, 

and essentially vanish upon extrapolation, both {5,6} and the smaller {Q,5}.  

In other words, AV{5,6}Z, ACV{5,6}Z, and the AV6Z(no i)/AV7Z(no k) sequence  all yield 

essentially  the  same  values.  For  the  TAE42  set,  all  three  of  these  agree  to  within  about  0.01 

kcal/mol  RMS,  as  do  AV{Q,5}Z  and  ACV{Q,5}Z  with  Schwenke’s  extrapolation  (or 

Ranasinghe and Petersson’s,101 which yields nearly equivalent results). Extrapolation in the REF-

{h,i} results bridges 0.025 kcal/mol RMS. 

Concerning  F12  calculations,  unscaled  (T)  is  clearly  unacceptable  even  with  the  V5Z-F12 

basis set, at RMSD=0.18 kcal/mol for W4-15. Uniform scaling (Ts), as proposed in Ref. 67], yields 

RMSD=0.10  kcal/mol  for  VQZ-F12,  and  still  RMSD=0.04  kcal/mol  for  V5Z-F12.  The  (Tbsc) 

procedure, proposed in Ref. 70 and found to be successful there for noncovalent interactions and 

smaller basis sets, turns out to work less well than (Ts), at RMSD=0.06 kcal/mol; since generally 

(Ts) < (Tbsc) < (T*), it does not surprise that (T*) would be even less effective.  

In  fact,  the  AV{Q,5}Z  extrapolation  that  went  into  the  W4-11  paper  has  a  smaller  RMSD. 

Simply  replacing  the  extrapolation  there  by  Schwenke’s  reduces  its  error  to  0.008  kcal/mol 

RMS. Similar results are obtained for ACV{Q,5}Z.

We  conclude  that  for  accurate  thermochemical  work,  it  is  best  to  obtain  (T)  separately  from 

orbital  calculations,  preferably  AV{Q,5}Z+d  or  better,  and  add  that  on  to  CCSD-F12b/cc-

pV{Q,5}Z-F12 results.  

Application to larger systems: benzene 

26 

 
 
A full W4 calculation on benzene is precluded by near-singularity issues in the aug-cc-pV6Z 

basis set for benzene, as was also seen in recent studies by Harding et al. (HVGSK)30 on benzene 

itself, and by Xantheas102 on benzene dimer. This is obviously to some extent a result of the lack 

of need for diffuse functions with this large basis set, particularly for H. We were able to carry 

out  CCSD/cc-pV6Z  calculations  without  any  issues  though.   Our  data  below  are  at  the 

CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ  geometry,  rCH  =  1.08260  Å  and  rCC  =  1.39498  Å,  which  differs  from  the 

reference geometry of Harding et al. in that the C(1s) core electrons were frozen in the geometry 

optimization.  

The  RHF/cc-pV6Z  atomization  energy,  1044.97  kcal/mol,  agrees  very  closely  with  the 

HF+CABS/cc-pVQZ-F12  value  of  1044.99  kcal/mol,  and  its  cc-pV5Z-F12  counterpart  of 

1045.01 kcal/mol.   

At the CCSD/cc-pV5Z and CCSD/cc-pV6Z levels, we obtain valence correlation contributions 

of  286.04  and  288.14  kcal/mol,  respectively,  leading  to  an  extrapolated  CCSD/cc-pV{5,6}Z 

basis set limit of 290.72 kcal/mol using Schwenke’s extrapolation.  

At  the  CCSD-F12b/cc-pVQZ-F12  level,  we  obtain  290.594  kcal/mol;  with  the  cc-pV5Z-F12 

basis  set,  this  rises  to  290.683  kcal/mol,  leading  to  a  CCSD-F12b/cc-pV{Q,5}Z-F12  limit  of 

290.71  kcal/mol.   The  orbital-based  and  F12  calculations  are  thus  seen  to  be  in  perfect 

agreement.  

The calculated (T)/cc-pVnZ (n = Q, 5) energies of 25.908 and 26.362 kcal/mol translate into a 

Schwenke extrapolated value of 26.70 kcal/mol. The unscaled (T) contribution from CCSD(T)-

F12b/cc-pV5Z-F12  is  26.294  kcal/mol.  Marchetti-Werner  scaling86  (based  on  the  molecular 

Ecorr[MP2-F12]/Ecorr[MP2]  ratio)  leads  to  (T*sc)  =  26.978  kcal/mol;  in  contrast,  (Tbsc)  obtained 

27 

 
from  the Ecorr[CCSD-F12b]/Ecorr[CCSD],  as  proposed  in  Ref.70  clocks  in  at  (Tbsc)  =  26.828 

kcal/mol, much closer to the conventional value. Uniform scaling of the triples, as proposed by 

us in Ref.67 leads to a smaller (Ts) = 26.651 kcal/mol.   

The  valence  CCSD(T)  limit  works  out  to 1362.42  kcal/mol  combining  CCSD-F12b/cc-

pV{Q,5}Z-F12  with  (T)/V{Q,5}Z.  Core-valence  correlation  at  the  CCSD(T)  level  adds  6.670 

(awCVTZ) and 7.074 (awCVQZ) kcal/mol, which extrapolates to 7.369 kcal/mol at the basis set 

limit.  (The  Schwenke  and  L–3  extrapolations  are  essentially  equivalent  for  that  basis  set  pair.) 

This works out to a CCSD(T) all-electron limit of 1369.79 kcal/mol, about 0.5 kcal/mol lower 

than  the HVGSK  limit  of  1370.3  kcal/mol  (Table  IV  in  that  work).  After  adding  in  post-

CCSD(T)  correlation  contributions,  scalar  relativistic  effects,  atomic  spin-orbit  splitting, 

diagonal  Born-Oppenheimer  corrections,  and  the  anharmonic  zero-point  vibrational  energy, 

those authors end up with a TAE of 5463.0±3.1  kJ/mol, i.e., 1305.7±0.74 kcal/mol, which is in 

excellent  agreement  with 

the 

latest  ATcT 

(Active  Thermochemical  Tables103–109) 

[[http://atct.anl.gov ver. 1.112]] value of 1305.9±0.1 kcal/mol.   

The  contribution  of  fully  iterative  triples  was  found  as  -2.62  kcal/mol  in  this  work, 

extrapolated  from  cc-pV(D,T}Z.  This  is  not  greatly  different  from  -2.68  kcal/mol  obtained  by 

HVGSK.  Those  authors  treated  T4  as  a CCSDT(Q)/cc-pVDZ  value,  essentially  identical  to  our 

recalculation at the present geometry of +1.63 kcal/mol.  

We  were,  however,  able  to  complete  a  CCSDT(Q)/cc-pVTZ  calculation  on  benzene,  which 

entailed  2.2  trillion  (Q)  contributions  and  3.1  billion  iterative  CCSDT  amplitudes.  This  led 

to 1.9823  kcal/mol.  As  we  have  previously  shown19  that  the  basis  set  convergence  of  (Q) 

empirically  follows  a  similar  L–3  pattern  as  the  CCSD  correlation  energy,  the  extrapolated  cc-

28 

 
pV{D,T}Z value becomes +2.13 kcal/mol. Thus, the gap between the respective CCSD(T) limits 

is almost exactly compensated by the gap in the post-CCSD(T) corrections.  

At the end of the day, both groups are in excellent agreement with the ATcT determination.  

A W4-F12 PROTOCOL AND ITS PERFORMANCE 

The W4-F12 protocol is now defined as follows: 

• CCSD contribution at the CCSD-F12b/cc-pV{Q,5}Z-F12 level with β = 1.4 

• SCF contribution from HF+CABS with the cc-pV5Z-F12 basis set in the CCSD step 

• (T) extrapolated using Schwenke’s formula from CCSD(T)/AV{Q,5}Z+d basis sets 

• all remaining steps as in the original W4 protocol 

In  Ref.42,  for  the  ATcT  data  available  at  the  time  (only  species  with  ATcT  uncertainty  0.10 

kcal/mol or less were considered), the RMSD for W4 theory was found to be 0.102 kcal/mol. In 

the present work, we apply inverse-variance weighting to the experimental data, except that we 

apply  a  lower  bound  of  0.005  kcal/mol  to  the  uncertainties,  lest  the  very  precise  experimental 

values  for  a  few  diatomics  overwhelm  the  other  data.  Thus,  we  obtain  a  weighted  RMSD  of 

0.105  kcal/mol  for  straight  W4,  compared  to  0.071  kcal/mol  for  W4-F12,  0.085  for  W4  with 

ACVnZ basis sets, and 0.080 kcal/mol for W4 with one extra zeta in the sp parts of the basis sets. 

Adjusting the lower bound downward increases the gap in favor of W4-F12: for instance, with a 

lower bound of 0.002 kcal/mol we obtainRMSD=0.055 kcal/mol for W4-F12, compared to 0.099 

kcal/mol for straight W4 and 0.064 kcal/mol for W4 with an extra zeta in sp. If instead we adjust 

29 

 
the  lower  uncertainty  bound  upward  to  0.01  kcal/mol,  W4,  W4-F12,  and  W4  with  an  extra  sp 

zeta clock in at 0.11, 0.085, and 0.079 kcal/mol, respectively.  

Particularly satisfying is the reduction in the error for the accurately known dissociation energy 

of Cl2 from –0.15 to –0.04 kcal/mol. If we switch to W4.4,19 that is, improve the post-CCSD(T) 

terms,  this  adds  0.05  kcal/mol  to  the  TAE,  bringing  theory  and  experiment  in  complete 

agreement.  

CONCLUSIONS 

The main conclusions we can draw from these results are the following:  

•  For  the  valence  CCSD  component,  which  represents  the  lion’s  share  of  the  basis  set 

convergence problem in computational thermochemistry, there are significant differences 

between  orbital-based  CCSD/AV{5,6}Z+d  binding  energies  and  their   CCSD-F12b/cc-

pV{Q,5}Z-F12 counterparts. 

•  Upon  exploration  of  radially  more  flexible  basis  set  families  in  the  orbital  CCSD 

calculations,  these differences are greatly reduced. Even the addition of a single zeta in 

just the valence orbitals removes most of the discrepancy. 

•  The effect is particularly pronounced for second-row compounds, and to a lesser extent 

for first-row compounds with strongly ionic bonds. 

•  Counterpoise  calculations  reveal  that,  while  TAEs  with  V5Z-F12  basis  sets  are  nearly 

free of BSSE, orbital calculations have significant BSSE even with AV(6+d)Z basis sets. 

AV{5,6}Z+d  extrapolation  still  leaves  BSSE  in  the  0.10  kcal/mol  range  for  Cl2.  The 

30 

 
problem  is  greatly  reduced  by  switching  to  ACV{5,6}Z  core-valence  basis  sets,  or  the 

next larger valence basis sets with the top angular momentum deleted. 

• 

In  F12  calculations,  the  main  advantage  of  cc-pVnZ-F12  basis  sets  (n=T,Q,5)  over  the 

AVnZ  counterparts  rests  in  greatly  reduced  basis  set  superposition  error.  BSSE  in  fact 

causes nonmonotonic basis set convergence of the atomization energy with AVnZ basis 

sets. 

•  Even AV(6+d)Z, let alone AV(5+d)Z, basis sets still do not reach the SCF limit for some 

second-row  systems.  Switching  to  ACV6Z  or  even  ACV5Z  completely  removes  the 

issue. 

•  Previous reports that all-electron approaches like HEAT lead to different CCSD(T) limits 

than  “valence  limit+CV  correction”  approaches  like  W4  theory  can  be  rationalized  in 

terms of the greater radial flexibility of core-valence basis sets. 

•  Considering  the  great  cost  and  mass  storage  requirements  of  ACV6Z  basis  set 

calculations,  CCSD-F12b/cc-pV{Q,5}Z-F12  offers  an  accurate  and  cost-effective 

alternative, as demonstrated by an application on benzene. 

•  For (T) corrections, however, Marchetti-Werner scaling or the CCSD-F12b based variant 

proposed  by  us70  still  cause  unacceptable  errors,  while  the  term  can  be  obtained 

accurately  and  fairly  inexpensively  from  conventional  calculations  with  at  most 

AV(5+d)Z basis sets. 

•  At the end of the day, for the W4-F12 protocol, we recommend obtaining the SCF and 

valence CCSD components from CCSD-F12b/cc-pV{Q,5}Z-F12 calculations, but the (T) 

31 

 
component 

from  conventional  CCSD(T)/aug’-cc-pV{Q,5}Z+d  calculations  using 

Schwenke’s  extrapolation.  W4-F12  is  found  to  yield  better  agreement  with  ATcT 

reference  data  than  ordinary  W4,  despite  W4-F12  having  much  smaller  CPU  time  and 

resource requirements.
