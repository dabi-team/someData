Abstract

Monitoring economic conditions and ﬁnancial stability with an early warning system serves
as a prevention mechanism for unexpected economic events. In this paper, we investigate the
statistical performance of sequential break-point detectors for stationary time series regression
models with extensive simulation experiments. We employ an online sequential scheme for
monitoring economic indicators from the European as well as the American ﬁnancial markets
that span the period during the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. Our results show that the performance
of these tests applied to stationary time series regressions such as the AR(1) as well as the
AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) depend on the severity of the break as well as the location of the break-
point within the out-of-sample period. Consequently, our study provides some useful insights
to practitioners for sequential break-point detection in economic and ﬁnancial conditions.

1 Introduction

Monitoring ﬁnancial stability using break-point detection schemes provides a mechanism for
avoiding economic losses. From the risk management point of view, structural instability in
time series regression models translates into presence of systemic risk in ﬁnancial markets.
According to Gramlich and Oet (2011) these vulnerabilities make the ﬁnancial systems less
resilient and risk-absorbent. On the other hand, current innovations in ﬁnancial products
increase the monitoring complexity in capturing dynamic systemic risk transmission. From
the economics point of view, detecting structural breaks in economic conditions and ﬁnancial
stress indicators provides a signal for an upcoming recession allowing policy-makers to assess
macroeconomic conditions in real time and thus decide whether a warning should be issued.

Speciﬁcally, such tail events are captured by early warning indicators, (EWIs), which are
used by ﬁnancial institutions and policymakers as a macro-prudential tool and a signalling
tool for economic recessions. Therefore, constructing EWIs permits to sequentially monitor
economic conditions (ECIs) and ﬁnancial stability indicators (FSIs) as well as the long-term
equilibrium of economic fundamentals signalling this way an upcoming recession when these
deviate from predeﬁned thresholds. In this ﬁeld, two econometricians Mark W. Watson and
James Stock have pioneered the development and monitoring of such indicators. The study of
Stock and Watson (1989) discusses relevant aspects for developing leading economic indicators
(such as variable selection methods) for monitoring the US economy during the late 1980s.
Furthermore, the study of Watson et al. (1991) discusses the use the probit and logit models
for predicting the probability of recession (see, also Estrella and Mishkin (1998)).

Furthermore, according to Babeck`y et al. (2012) monitoring suitable EWIs provides a tool for
optimum decision making for necessary macroprudential measures aimed at reducing the risk
of occurrence of ﬁnancial crises by mitigating their impact on the economy. More importantly,
the classiﬁcation of appropriate EWIs depends on: (i) the deﬁnition of crisis occurrence1, (ii)
the nature of the crisis (banking, currency, ﬁnancial, economic) and (iii) the characteristics of
the crisis on the real economy. A currency crisis can include high exchange rate depreciation,
a banking crisis might include the exposure of banks to systemic risk while a debt crisis might
include the need for a debt restructuring. Therefore an aggregated collection of time series
observations from such ﬁnancial sectors contributes to the robust construction of economic
indices for monitoring occurrence of economic crises (Babeck`y et al., 2012).

Our study considers both linear time series regressions such as the stationary AR(1) model as
well as the non-linear AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model for sequentially detecting structural breaks
using weekly and monthly frequency NFCI and CISS indices. We consider ﬁrst diﬀerenced
stationary series following the literature of structural break testing procedures which operate
under the assumption of stationarity and ergodicity. Our aim is to investigate the properties
of various break-point detectors when these are employed within the sequentially monitoring
framework of Chu et al. (1996). Furthermore, for statistical inference purposes we consider
the hitting times of Brownian motions (stopping rule) since the underline stochastic processes
of the proposed test statistics are assumed to be mean-reverting. Moreover, we investigate the
ﬁnite and large sample performance of the break-point detectors via extensive Monte Carlo
simulation experiments in which we obtain the empirical size, power function and average run
length distributions for a ﬁxed nominal size (see, also Aue et al. (2009)).

1More speciﬁcally, an economic crisis is deﬁned as the beginning in the quarter in which the real GDP of
an economy falls below the preceding 4-quarter moving average and ending in the quarter in which real GDP
reaches the pre-crisis level (see Vegh and Vuletin (2014)).

1.1 Literature Review

In this study we distinguish between the types of break-point detection procedures, that is,
the in-sample (historical-based) procedures and the sequential monitoring procedures. The
historical monitoring procedures include the various F-tests which are suitable for testing the
null hypothesis of no structural instability based on the full sample such as the studies of Chow
(1960), Dufour (1982) and Hansen (2001) who test for structural breaks in the US Labour pro-
ductivity using the Chow statistic. Similar frameworks which operate under the assumption
of a known break-point location include the residual-based tests for detecting parameter con-
stancy of regression coeﬃcients under the null hypothesis. In particular, Brown et al. (1975)
propose the OLS-CUSUM test based on cumulated sums of recursive residuals for testing for
single structural change in the model coeﬃcients of the linear regression model.

Further studies related to historical monitoring procedures include test statistics based on
recursive residuals (see, Krämer et al. (1991)) as well as reﬁnements of CUSUM type test
statistics based on OLS-residuals such as Krämer et al. (1988), Ploberger and Krämer (1990)
and Ploberger and Krämer (1992), Deng and Perron (2008) and Andreou (2008) who propose
local power corrections. Moreover, the seminal study of Andrews (1993) propose likelihood
ratio and Wald-type statistics for testing for testing the null hypothesis of no parameter in-
stability in linear regression models at unknown break-point locations. Lastly, Leisch et al.
(2000) extend the aforementioned methodologies to the generalized ﬂuctuation test.

In-sample structural break-testing procedures were extended to testing procedures using an
out-of-sample monitoring scheme; implying an estimation window of ﬁxed size and an out-
of-sample window for testing. In particular, in this direction the studies of Kuan and Chen
(1994) and Chu et al. (1995b) propose the recursive estimates and moving estimates tests for
parameter stability respectively. Additionally, Chu et al. (1995a) propose the OLS-MOSUM
test which is constructed based on sums of a ﬁxed number of residuals from a rolling window.
More recent applications which include comparisons between historical and online monitoring
include Zeileis et al. (2010) where the authors use M-type statistics to monitor structural
breaks in the Chinese and Indian exchange rate regimes and Zeileis et al. (2005) with focus on
sequential monitoring procedures in dynamic models.

Sequential monitoring frameworks are investigated in the studies of Berkes et al. (2004) and
Aue and Horváth (2013). In practise, within a sequential monitoring scheme model-based es-
timates and functionals from continuously updated time series observations are compared to
the corresponding estimates based on observations from the historical period. Under the law
of iterated logarithms a large repetition would imply to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis
of no structural break with probability approaching to one which ensure that the monoton-
ically increasing property of the power function of these tests holds. On the other hand,
in-sample structural break testing procedures are based on controlled asymptotic size proper-
ties which can satisfy a uniform property under further regularity conditions (see, Chu et al.
(1996) and Leisch et al. (2000)). Generally, current methodologies in the literature, regard-
less of the monitoring scheme employed, focus on structural change testing and estimation for
distribution moments which implies break detection in the conditional mean, the conditional
variance or higher moments of partial sum processes (Hansen (2000), Horváth et al. (2001),
Kulperger et al. (2005) and Pitarakis (2004)). Other studies focus on developing methodologies
for testing for multiple break-points such as in the studies of Bai (1997), Bai and Perron (1998)
and Andreou and Ghysels (2006), although multiple break-point testing is not so common for
sequential monitoring schemes. We leave this aspect for future research.

1.2 Motivation and Outline

In this paper, we focus on sequential break-point detection for linear and non-linear time series
regression models. In particular, we focus on detecting for structural breaks based on linear
time series models such as the stationary AR(1) regression model using time series observations
of economic condition indices. More precisely, we utilize regression estimate-based processes
as well as regression residual-based processes for the construction of the testing framework.
The former type of ﬂuctuation processes includes tests such as the recursive-estimates process,
(RE) and the moving estimates test, (ME). The latter includes recursive residuals based tests
such as the CUSUM test and the MOSUM test or OLS residuals-based tests such as the OLS-
CUSUM test and the OLS-MOSUM test (Chen, 2002). We evaluate the asymptotic properties
of these test statistics with a Monte Carlo simulation study where the presence of empirical size
distortions or the non-monotonicity of power can indicate for possible problematic assumptions.
Kuan and Chen (1994) consider the ME and FL processes and suggest modiﬁed versions to
deal with the problem of size distortion for variables with high autocorrelation.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the econometric model and the sequential
break-point detection framework along with main modelling assumptions. Section 3 presents
the main ﬁndings of the Monte Carlo simulation study based on the break-point detectors we
examine in this paper. Section 4 presents a discussion on the sequential monitoring procedure.
Moreover, a discussion related to momentary and economic policy is also presented. Section 5
summarizes the main concluding remarks and discusses relevant aspects for future research.

The parameters β1, β2 and κ, where κ > 1 is the break-point location are the theoretical model
parameters which are to be estimated from the ﬁtted econometrics model under examination.
In particular, for the Monte Carlo Simulation Study of the paper we consider a stationary
AR(1) model with an intercept such that yt = µ + ρyt−1 + ǫt. However, in this section we
consider a general linear regression model such that yt = x′

Deﬁnition 1. (Monitoring Scheme). A monitoring scheme is a stopping time, which indicates
the detection of a structural instability in the econometric model. Let Γ
be the detector
function and b(t) the boundary function over an appropriate common time interval (monitoring
period). The empirical ﬂuctuation process rejects the null hypothesis, H0, when the detector
becomes greater than the boundary function at a given time within the monitoring period.

Based on the formulation of the testing hypothesis and the deﬁnition of the monitoring scheme,
detecting for structural break in the model implies rejecting the null hypothesis of no structural
instability when the detector has high enough ﬂuctuations to cross a pre-speciﬁed boundary ap-
proximated with the crossing probabilities of the Brownian motion. Similar assumptions can be
found in the generalized ﬂuctuation testing framework of Leisch et al. (2000) and Zeileis et al.
(2005) as well as in the study of Andreou and Ghysels (2006)). Furthermore, the error term
N
t=1 is assumed to be exogenous (representing economic, monetary and ﬁnancial market

{
shocks) but an i.i.d Gaussian process. Furthermore, we consider that the FCLT result holds
which implies a weak convergence for the partial sum processes of the model residuals and thus
ensures that the asympototic behaviour of a sequential test
is similar to the probability
one convergence; i.e., spend nearly all of its time arbitrarily close to the same limit process
(see, Kushner and Yin (2003)).

2.2 Sequential Break-Point Detection Framework

The sequential (online) break-point detection procedure2 is brieﬂy explained with the following
steps. First, a random process produces randomly the observations xt which are received in
the algorithm sequentially (online). Second, the detector function based on a pre-speciﬁed rule
(boundary) decides on a timely manner (stopping rule) whether a break has occurred at an
unknown break-point location within the monitoring period. Moreover, relevant probability
bounds ensures that the trade-oﬀ between high volume of false-alarms and low volume of
true positives is accommodated in the sequential procedure (see, (Brodsky and Darkhovsky,
2013)). Furthermore, the limiting theorems of sequential theory and Brownian motion provide
the necessary tools for constructing a sequential monitoring framework.

Deﬁnition 2. (Stopping time) A stopping time of a sequential monitoring process is

τn(κ) = min

(2.7)

where the detector function and boundary function are chosen so that under Assumption 2,
the following probability limits hold

(2.8)

where α is the signiﬁcance level (nominal size of the null hypothesis) such that 0 < α < 1.

More speciﬁcally, the detector function is a function of the historical period and is updated in a
sequential manner. Furthermore, the stopping time (or decision rule) as well as the boundary
function requires a critical value in order to detect parameter instability (see Section 2.3),
which can be also seen in terms of a likelihood ratio procedure, such that

τn(κ) = inf

Therefore, based on the above sequential monitoring scheme and suppose that Assumptions
1-3 hold, then we can test for a structural break in the coeﬃcients of the econometric model
within the monitoring period. In terms of the relevant methodologies currently presented in the
literature, Leisch et al. (2000) propose an econometric framework for sequential monitoring for
structural breaks using recursive and moving estimates processes, which are cumulative sums of
model residuals. Horváth et al. (2004) consider the sequential monitoring of the mean function
using the OLS and the recursive CUSUM of residuals3, where emphasis is given in the properties
of the boundary function (i.e.,b6(t)) in regards to the break-point location. Furthermore, based
on a similar monitoring scheme, Hušková and Chochola (2010) propose a detection in the
distribution of sequential arriving time series observations while Chochola (2008) consider an
OLS-CUSUM square process to monitor sequentially changes in the variance, a method also
presented by Chen et al. (2010). Lastly, Zeileis et al. (2005) consider both classes of processes
(estimates-based and residual-based) using econometric models and emphasis on rescaling the
parameters when serial correlation exists, which is closer to the framework of our study.

2Notice that the sequential statistical analysis was ﬁrst introduced during the 1940s with the purpose of
increasing eﬃciency in acceptance sampling and extended to survival analysis models such as the proportional
hazard model (Siegmund, 1986).

3Notice that the standard CUSUM process is based on recursive model residuals and has been proposed in

the seminal study of Krämer et al. (1991).

Recursive Estimates process: The process as described by Chu et al. (1996) and by
Leisch et al. (2000) is based on recursive estimates,(RE), for detecting any structural instability
in the model. The RE detector is deﬁned as the deviation of the updated parameter estimate
ˆβ(m) from the historical parameter estimate ˆβ(n). Under the null hypothesis the process stays
in control since there is no structural break and the detector is below the boundary function.

More detailed regarding the properties of these probability limits can be found in the study
of Robbins and Siegmund (1970) as well as in Corollary 3.6 of Chu et al. (1996)). Moreover,
the particular probability bounds permit to monitor the ﬂuctuations induced by the empirical
ﬂuctuation process sequentially, which ensures the existence of a crossing probability with a
controlled asymptotic size. Although, due to the monitoring scheme which implies continuously
updated comparisons of historical based estimates and out-of-sample based estimates results
to a higher computational complexity (and rate of convergence) than conventional processes.

6

Moving Estimates process: This process presented in Leisch et al. (2000) consists of mov-
ing sums of estimated regression coeﬃcients, which compares sequentially the deviation of the
moving-window estimates to the whole sample estimates for break point detection. The partic-
ular process seems to be more sensitive to the choice of the boundary function, to the sample
size of the historical period as well as to any violations in the independent assumption of
observations. To deal with the problem of serial and high autocorrelation in stationary time
series regression models (e.g., models we use for simulations and estimations) Kuan and Chen
(1994) propose a modiﬁcation in the estimation method of the covariance matrix Ω(n). More-
over, Chu et al. (1995b) present the asymptotic properties of the ME process estimates and
its limiting distribution (i.e., Brownian bridge increments). The ME detector is given by

The rescaled version of the covariance matrix Ω(n), which can adopted to both RE and ME
processes and given by Ω(⌊nt⌋−⌊nh⌋,⌊nh⌋) instead of using just the full historical period uses
only the corresponding observations used in each moving iteration in order to rescale the
estimate of the model parameter. Both covariances matrices converge asymptotically to the
true covariance matrix, however Kuan and Chen (1994) illustrate with a simulation study that
the rescaled covariance matrix has faster rate of convergence and reduce bias, increasing the
robustness and accuracy of the algorithm.

2.2.2 Sequential Residual-based processes

The sequential residual-based processes are less computational expensive than the estimates-
based processes since these processes monitor sequentially the residuals of a regression model
computed at the beginning of the algorithm.

OLS-CUSUM: The OLS-CUSUM partial sum process consists of cumulative sums of stan-
dardized residuals and is often used in literature as a break point detector.
In particular,
Brown et al. (1975) study the properties of the (non-sequential) OLS-CUSUM and OLS-
CUSUM squares. The detector function is given by the following expression

Gn(r) =

, where ˆǫ(n)

t = yt −

t = n + 1, ..., N.

(2.17)

Under the null hypothesis of no structural instability, the process Gn(r) can be proved to con-
verge into a Brownian bridge, σW 0(t), which is the corresponding limiting process. Moreover,
the OLS-CUSUM process is well suited to detect relatively short lasting structural instability
and performs better for changes early in the monitoring period.

Another important aspect of consideration, especially when monitoring time series regression
models such as the stationary AR(1) model, is to provide a correction for the covariance matrix
since the existence of a structural break can cause inﬂated values for ˆρ (close to unit root) and
possibly contributing to a spurious unit root, which consequently can aﬀect the power of the
test statistic. In particular, Andreou (2008) prove that a HAC estimator, using a boundary
condition to control the divergence of the long term variance, can ﬁx the monotonicity property
of the power function and improve the asymptotic properties of the empirical size.

with its limit distribution depending on the distribution of the errors and approximated by a
Brownian bridge Deng and Perron (2008). An appropriate modiﬁcation of the above detector
function along with an appropriate boundary function (e.g., b6(t)) that has traceable crossing
probabilities yields the corresponding sequential process suitable for the monitoring schemes
we consider in this paper.

OLS-MOSUM: The OLS-MOSUM process is constructed based on sums of residuals, with
the main diﬀerence between the OLS-CUSUM process to be the endogenous computation of
the detector function, such that the least-square residuals are estimated using a regression

Therefore, it can be easily proved that the OLS-MOSUM test statistic has a limiting process
which corresponds to the Brownian bridge increments (see e.g., Chu et al. (1995b)). The
known form of the limiting distribution simpliﬁes statistical inference. Furthermore, the OLS-
MOSUM detector might be better suited for sequential detection of multiple breaks due to the
nature of the algorithm. We can investigate the particular aspect in future research.

In particular a sketch proof for the limit result of Theorem 1 (iii) can be found in the Appendix
of the paper. However, notice that a review of these limit results especially to accommodate
correctly the features of these detectors within the monitoring period is essential to develop
relevant asymptotic theory. We will examine the particular aspects in a future research paper.

2.3 Crossing probabilities and boundary functions

Detecting structural breaks within the proposed framework implies the use of a sequential
detection algorithm. The boundary functions are selected so that they satisfy certain regularity
conditions such that the algorithm has a fast break point detection. Extensive examination
of these regularity conditions are presented in the studies of Robbins and Siegmund (1970),
Lerche (1986) as well as in Chu et al. (1996). Appropriate conditions include the existence of
a concave non-decreasing function b(t) as t

→ ∞
More precisely, under the null hypothesis of no parameter instability within the monitoring
period, these boundary functions do not aﬀect the empirical size of the test statistics since a
pre-speciﬁed crossing probability (signiﬁcance level) is deﬁned to control the size. However,
under the alternative hypothesis the power function of the test statistics is aﬀected by the
capability of the boundary to detect any early signs of structural instability in the parameters
of the model (Zeileis et al., 2005). We consider the following linear and non-linear (parabolic
and logarithmic) boundary functions for the empirical ﬂuctuation processes.

that these correspond to monitoring periods with T = 2 and T = 10 as seen on Figure a
and Figure b respectively. These are considered to be of order √t and
log(t) respectively
(see, (Leisch et al., 2000)). Therefore, the speciﬁc boundary functions have diﬀerent behaviour
when employed as stopping rules within a sequential monitoring scheme, which depends on the
location of the break point (such as early vis-a-vis late break), on the empirical process used
(such as RE tends to be sensitive for late breaks) as well as the severity of the ﬂuctuation (e.g.,
volatility persistence) and can be observed especially by the performance of the average run
length as well as by empirical size or power distortions using a Monte Carlo simulation study.

Boundary b1(t) which has a closed form crossing probability is introduced by Chu et al. (1996)
and its applicability is also investigated by Zeileis et al. (2005) which introduce the alternative
boundary b3 (no known closed form crossing probability). Furthermore, Boundary b2(t) is
considered by Zeileis (2001) and boundaries b4(t) and b5(t) are studied by Zeileis (2005). The
critical values for the boundaries b1(t), b2(t), b3(t), b4(t) and b5(t) are λ =7.78, 3.15, 1.58,
2.49 and 6.043 respectively for signiﬁcance level α = %. Boundary b6(t) is especially useful
for sequential monitoring schemes and corresponding critical values for this boundary can be
found on Table 1 in Horváth et al. (2004) (e.g., for α = 5% and γ = 0.25 then λ = 2.386).

Boundaries b7(t), b8(t) and b9(t) are variations of the aforementioned boundaries and chosen
to satisfy the properties of empirical size and power. Other boundary functions are examined by

3 Monte Carlo Simulation Study

Our Monte Carlo Simulation Study aims to assess the statistical validity and eﬀectiveness of
the proposed break-point detection algorithms for ﬁnite (e.g., N = 200) and asymptotic sample
(e.g., N = 2000) sizes via a simulated environment controlled by varying certain factors that
represent stylized facts of ﬁnancial data and in particular speciﬁc characteristics of ﬁnancial
indicators. These include the nature of the data generating process (DGP), (we illustrate and
discuss the results for only one DGP for comparability purposes), the case of spurious breaks
and existence of persistence in the model parameters, the break-point location, the sample
size of historical and monitoring period (by varying the sampling frequency) which permits to
obtain distribution of the detection delay of the empirical ﬂuctuation processes.

3.1 Empirical size and power of testing hypothesis

The computation of the empirical size, under the null hypothesis of structural stability, as well
as of the power, under the alternative hypothesis of a single structural break at unknown break-
point within the monitoring period is carried out with a Monte Carlo procedure. Statistically
these can be considered as the probability of doing Type I Error and the complement of the
probability of doing a Type II Error respectively, which can be helpful to control for algorithmic
convergence using B = 2, 500 repetitions. Comparing the monotonicity property of the power
function as well as checking for any empirical size distortions is a standard way to choose
between competing empirical ﬂuctuation processes (Stock, 1994).

More precisely, for the computation of the empirical size we keep the model parameters stable
throughout the monitoring period while for the simulations of the power we introduce artiﬁcial
breaks at pre-speciﬁed locations such that at 25%, 50% and 75% of the monitoring period.
, where for N = 200
100, ..., 1000
Furthermore, we consider diﬀerent sample sizes, such as n =
}
{
we represent a monthly frequency indicator for a period of about 16 years while for N = 1000
we represent a weekly frequency indicator. Both computations can be thought in simple terms
as percentages of the number of times the sequential processes detect structural change in
the total times of algorithmic repetitions. We present the results of the simulations for the
empirical size of the null hypothesis of no structural break, and the power of the alternative
hypothesis of existence of an artiﬁcial structural break in the model, as these are deﬁned by
Assumption 2 with N = 2n. We also compute the detection of delay times of the empirical size
and the power for the sequential processes using the boundary functions introduced in Section
2.3. The data generating process (DGP) we use to carry out the simulations is given by

yt = µ + ρyt−1 + ǫt, t =

1, ..., n, n + 1, ..., N

and ǫt ∼

N (0, 1)

(3.1)

which produces normally distributed i.i.d random variables, that satisfy our assumptions.

0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9
}
{

Under the null hypothesis, we set the model intercept with µ = 1 and the autocorrelation
coeﬃcient ρ =
to consider the existence of diﬀerent autocorrelation scenarios
within the model such that for example, ρ = 0.3 can be considered as a stationary model with
I(0) time series while ρ = 0.9 can be considered as as a non-stationary model with parameter
persistence, almost I(1). Under the alternative hypothesis we consider two scenarios; (a) a
structural break in the model intercept µ (µ = 1
µ = 1.5); and (b) a structural break in the
autocorrelation coeﬃcient ρ (ρ = 0.3

0.5, 0.6, 0.7).

An important point worth emphasizing when comparing between these diﬀerent metrics for the
sequential monitoring scheme is the fact that the suitability of a boundary function to detect
structural changes depends on the detector function (due to the fact that these processes
tend to have diﬀerent type of ﬂuctuations). Furthermore, when examining the properties
of empirical size we can verify whether the results are uniformly distributed, close to the
nominal signiﬁcance level (α = 5%) with low empirical size distortions, while checking also
the performance the Average Run Length (ARL), that is, the break point detection timing
for each process under each scenario. We obtain the simulated empirical size results for the
OLS-CUSUM and RE test statistics using the boundary functions b1(t), b2(t), b3(t), b7(t), b8(t)
and b9(t). Moreover, the empirical size results based on the quadratic boundary functions b4(t)
and b5(t) have been also computed but since they produce rather low empirical sizes we have
not considered them further (seen also from their plots these boundaries level up too quickly
missing out almost most of the ﬂuctuations of the processes). Detailed describtion about the
performance of boundary b6(t) in simulations is given by Horváth et al. (2004). We ﬁnd that
the boundary function b1(t) and b3(t) introduced by Zeileis et al. (2005) provide good results,
such that for the case of OLS-CUSUM and autocorrelation between 0.3 to 0.7 the empirical
size is uniform especially after the ﬁnite sample size (i.e., n = 200).

Under the alternative hypothesis, we obtain the power with sample size n =
.
50, 100, 200, 1000
}
{
These results are reported on the Tables found in the Appendix of the paper that correspond
to structural breaks both in the model intercept and in the autocorrelation coeﬃcients. Some
conclusions regarding the performance of power of the test statistics are: (a) increasing the
sample size n, improves the detection performance signiﬁcantly with initial values close to 10%
for small sample sizes to values close to 1 for large sample sizes, (b) the precision of power
depends on the location of the structural change (for instance, structural break late in the
monitoring period reduces predictive power) and (c) the value of the autocorrelation coeﬃ-
cient aﬀects the accuracy of the algorithms (for example in the case of high autocorrelation
coeﬃcient such that ρ = 0.9 and large sample sizes appears to induce some power distortions).
Our simulation experiments verify that the power of the tests seem to satisfy the monotonic-
ity property of the power functions, but with diﬀerent rate of convergence across processes,
boundary functions and break point location. The aforementioned conclusions can be also
veriﬁed by observing the plots of power functions produced with B = 2, 500 replications for
n =

(and ρ = 0.3).

100, ..., 1000
}
{

In particular, the linear boundary b3(t) works provides good empirical size results for both the
OLS-CUSUM and RE test statistics for early and mid-way break-point locations (at 25% and
50% of the monitoring period). However, for the ME process and especially for late structural
breaks the hyperbolic boundaries are superior to the linear boundary which also shows the
robustness of the particular process for detecting changes with these boundaries late in the
monitoring period. Similarly, for the OLS-MOSUM process, late changes within the monitoring
period reduce the detection accuracy and robustness of the process with the linear boundary.
Furthermore, the choice of the bandwidth window h can aﬀect the empirical power results. In
particular, for the moving estimates processes, we set h = 0.5, which is an optimal bandwidth
choice that results to superior power when testing using the OLS-MOSUM test in comparison
to the other test statistics such as the maximal likelihood ratio test (see, Chu et al. (1995b)).
Lastly, the asymptotic behaviour of the particular test statistic shows a high probability of
detecting parameter instability within the monitoring period.

12

3.2 Average Run Length of empirical ﬂuctuation processes

The standard approach for assessing the performance of the detector functions in sequential
analysis is to determine the distribution of the average run-length (ARL) within the monitoring
period. Therefore, such a criterion to evaluate the proposed sequential processes is to test the
eﬀectiveness of the ARLs of the processes in detecting the break-point location. A relevant
study in the literature is presented by Moustakides (2004) who propose the min-max criterion
for accessing the eﬀectiveness of the CUSUM process. In this paper, we report the break-point
detection percentages, the ARL distributions as well as their standard deviation for the null
and alternative hypothesis on Tables 3 and 4 respectively. According to Chu et al. (1996) a
robust monitoring framework implies equivalent ARL distributions regardless of the break-
point location (that is, asymptotic distributions which are similar to the ideal shape of the
operating characteristic curve in an acceptance sampling scheme). In our simulation study we
consider the properties of ARLs for diﬀerent break-point locations under the alternatives.

Furthermore, we obtain the kernel densities of the simulated average delay times, which are
useful for examining the attributes that aﬀect the performance of ARL across the test statistics,
as seen on Figure 1 and Figure 2. For example for the OLS-CUSUM test with boundary b3,
the more negatively skewed is the location of the break in the monitoring period the lower the
ARL appears to be. Although the process seems to have higher ARL for early changes within
the monitoring period while induces an earlier indication for a later break, it seems to be of
similar variability regardless of the location of the break (under H0). Under the alternative as
expected the kernel densities have heavier tails to the left due to the properties of the power
functions. Our empirical ﬁndings as demonstrated by the kernel densities on the plots of Figure
1 and Figure 2 verify similar ﬁndings found in the literature (see, Aue et al. (2009)).

3.3 Explanation of the monitoring procedure

In this section we explain the procedure followed for monitoring the chosen indicators which
allow us to shed some light regarding the dating and duration of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 and
the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010; while at the same time providing a way to evaluate
the performance of the sequential break-point detection algorithms for detecting structural
instability in the ﬁtted models, such as the AR(1) model and the AR(1)-Garch(1,1) model.

Model estimations and sequential monitoring were carried out between 1999:01 to 2016:05 while
even though wider time intervals were considered such as 1985:01 to 2016:04 these results are
not presented here since the focus of our work is on capturing the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁnancial
crisis of 2008 and the spillover eﬀects to the ﬁnancial markets. However as pointed out by
Brave and Butters (2012) the particular sub-sampling approach contributes to a restricted
information set by omitting past crises. Furthermore, by monitoring a sub-sample before the
crisis, such as, 1999:01 to 2007:06 (or 1985:01 to 2007:06) we can verify the structural parameter
instability with a comparison of the full sample model estimates and the corresponding sub-
sample estimates as well as to check whether any other signiﬁcant structural instabilities exist.

13

Therefore, by monitoring the aforementioned leading indicators we aim to justify their stochas-
tic trends both statistically and economically and examine their behaviour ex ante and ex post.
Summary tables with the model estimations and sequential monitoring results for both level
and ﬁrst diﬀerence series can be found in the Appendix of the paper.

Firstly, we use the ADF unit root test, proposed by Dickey and Fuller (1979), to check for the
existence of unit roots in the time series observations. Our empirical ﬁndings show that for most
of the indicators the null hypothesis of a unit root is not rejected, which provides statistical
evidence of the permanent eﬀect that the shock of the ﬁnancial crisis had on these indicators as
well as the fact that such a shock is not a realization of the underline data generating process
but an exogeneous eﬀect (see, Perron (1989)). For example, the level series of the NFCI, STFSI
and CISS indicators have ADF statistics -2.44, -2.82 and -2.08 respectively with p-values > 0.10
signalling the existence of a unit root. However, although the non-stationary level series appear
to have high autocorrelations by taking ﬁrst diﬀerences the stationarity assumption is ensured
and satisfactory parameter estimates and HAC standard errors are obtained. Furthermore, we
implement the breakpoint unit root test (with Schwarz IC) to identify the structural break-
point location for the trend stationary series either in 2007:06 (an early sign of structural
instability of the indicators) or around the ﬁnancial crisis.

Secondly, the severity of the structural breaks of model parameters can be seen from the
diﬀerent values of the estimated model coeﬃcients through a UD max test which computes
the models between the regimes of the estimated breaks. More speciﬁcally, the particular
testing procedure shows the number of breakpoints as determined by the unweighed maximized
statistics. For example, implementing a UD max test with 3 breaks for the NFIC indicator
the procedure estimates the corresponding model parameters of the 3 regimes (e.g., 2006:05 to
2008:11 is yt = 0.12 + 1.12yt−1 while for 2008:12 to 2011:12 is yt =
0.05 + 0.87yt−1) showing
the changing stochastic trend of the speciﬁc indicator before and after the crisis. Furthermore,
we implement retrospective sequential procedure proposed by Bai and Perron (1998) which is
suitable for testing for multiple breaks to identify the break-point location in the stationary
time series of the indicators. The statistical signiﬁcance of the breaks is also veriﬁed with
information criteria, (IC), such as the Schwarz and LWZ5. Our estimations illustrate that the
LWZ statistic underestimates the number of breaks in the models, which is also veriﬁed by
Hall et al. (2013). On the other hand, Schwarz is more robust in identifying a break within
the duration interval of the ﬁnancial crisis; which we deﬁne to be 2008:10 to 2009:03. However,
notice that this is not a formal conﬁdence interval but a common interval of the monitored
indicators in which the structural instabilities appear to occur based on our empirical ﬁndings.

−

Furthermore, we use an F-statistic as an extra retrospective testing method to test against
a single-shift alternative of unknown timing which also identiﬁes a structural break within
the crisis interval (e.g, for NFCI and its components a break location lies in the interval
[2008:10,2008:12]. These particular F-statistics proposed by Andrews (1993) compare residu-
als between a segmented regression and an unsegmented model (see also Zeileis (2005)). Ad-
ditionally, as also discussed in Andreou and Ghysels (2009) multiple structural break testing
encompasses two diﬀerent procedures, the model selection based-approach and the sequential
sample segmentation approach. Our study mainly focuses on the classiﬁcation of retrospective
vis-a-vis sequential monitoring procedures.

5Notice that the IC are employed to estimate the number of breaks and include a term of the residual sum
of squares for s no. of breaks and a penalty term proportional to the number of parameters in the model. For
example, Hall et al. (2013) investigate the inferencing on structural breaks with the use of IC; such tests can
particularly applied on interest rate series to test for structural instability in monetary policy.

14

Next, we implement the retrospective monitoring processes to the estimated models, which
include the standard RE and OLS-CUSUM processes (with constant b(t) = c0 and linear
boundary b(t) = λt) as well as the OLS-CUSUM of squared residuals. Our empirical results
show that the OLS-CUSUM with both boundaries lack of any signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations, since
the underline process is not crossing its 5% level boundary, consequently a warning for struc-
tural instability is not issued (due to lack of power against shifts orthogonal to the mean
regressor, which can be veriﬁed by computing the ∆β shift between estimated coeﬃcients of
historical and monitoring period (see, Ploberger and Krämer (1990), Zeileis et al. (2005)). On
the other hand OLS-CUSUM-SQ has higher power (see Deng and Perron (2008)) in correctly
detecting a break (e.g., for CISS EU index a break is detected on 2008:10). This conjecture
is indeed veriﬁed by Ploberger and Krämer (1990) who examine the local power of CUSUM
and CUSUM-SQ showing that CUSUM-SQ has a limit distribution that depends on fourth
moments of disturbances and thus a non-trivial power even against heteroscedasticity.

Thirdly, the next stage to retrospective monitoring is the implementation of the sequential
monitoring procedure (based on the empirical ﬂuctuation processes) to both the regression
model (see Figure 4) and the residuals of Garch(1,1) of ﬁrst diﬀerence series (see Figure 5).
Speciﬁcally, we choose the monitoring period to be 2 times the historical period (i.e. N = 2n)
in order to match the monte carlo experiment of our simulation study. Thus, the period start-
ing on 1999:01 up to 2004:10 is considered as the historical period while 2004:11 to 2016:05
the monitoring period; within which the values of the sequential processes are computed and
monitored by checking whether they cross the pre-speciﬁed boundary function (using bound-
aries b1 and b3). For major indicators such as NFCI (and its components e.g., the risk index
has similar behaviour as the main index), STFSI, Bofa, Moodys and CISS sequential break
point detection is dated on 2008:10 (e.g., for monthly series, NFCI break is on 26/09/2008,
also veriﬁed by Brave and Butters (2012) as a day of ﬁnancial turbulence).

Furthermore, for less volatile indices such as the CFSI and KCFSI after ﬁrst diﬀerencing, the
sequential processes fail to detect the instability that is captured on their level series. Similarly,
for some of the sub-components of the indicators for example the case of the ﬁnancial market
component of CISS, the ﬂuctuations of the processes such as the OLS-CUSUM process seems
to be on a lower level than the ones of the main indicators; which is not surprising since the
sub-components have less features and cross-correlations and are less informative about the
overall ﬁnancial conditions and stability. As a result, the sequential processes fail to detect a
true structural break; nevertheless is important to monitor also these indicators in order to
verify our results and check which sub-series show ﬁnancial stress.

Our empirical study shows that monitoring the CISS Sovereign Stress Index component as well
and corresponding indicators of main European economies permits to evaluate their reaction
to economic events, such as the break-point location in comparison to the main index as well as
the duration and severity of the crisis in regards to the Sovereign Debt crisis of 2010. Although
large European economies such as Germany, had improvement in their ﬁnancial conditions after
the economic recession of 2008 (as seen from the level of the indicator), the Sovereign Debt
stress crisis in Europe exhibits heterogeneity across European countries with diﬀerent level of
ﬂuctuations and diﬀerent break-point locations and severity (asymmetric eﬀects).

15

To conclude, our monitoring procedures are eﬀective in capturing the signal of the ﬁnancial
crisis and match the events of September 2008 in US and are informative about the European
Sovereign Debt crisis of 2010. Moreover, some of the conclusions we get from the sequential
monitoring procedure include the following. Firstly, the choice of the boundary which aﬀects
the detection delay and type II error seems to depend on both the sampling frequency as
well as the size of the historical period in comparison to the sample size of the monitoring
period. For example a higher sampling frequency (such as weekly instead of monthly) seems
to require larger historical period for empirical ﬂuctuation procedures such as OLS-CUSUM
to run eﬀectively. Secondly, the choice of the process itself seems to depend on the nature
of ﬁnancial data under consideration. For example the OLS-CUSUM test statistic shows to
be robust in detecting parameter instabilities with low delay especially for indicators such as
NFCI and STFSI which show to have high volatility change and spike over a certain period of
time. On the other hand, empirical ﬂuctuation processes such as the OLS-MOSUM and ME
are shown to be aﬀected by the type of ﬁnancial data as well as the position of the structural
break within the monitoring period. Lastly, the choice of a dynamic boundary that moves
along the trend of the data and depends on the movement of the series historical observations
is an area worth investigating further.

In addition, we monitor the model residuals ﬁtted to level series produced from the ﬁtted
regression model as well as the residuals of the GARCH(1,1) model of the ﬁrst diﬀerence
series which appear to work well. In particular, for the non-linear time series we estimate the
models for monthly frequency data. However, for example for the CISS indicator we estimate
the Garch(1,1) model for both weekly and monthly frequency in order to examine the eﬀect
of sampling frequency on the robustness of the model parameters as well as the power of the
sequential detection algorithms. Estimation results can be found in the Appendix of the paper.

4 Economic and Monetary Policy Discussion

In this section we provide an overview of other important metrics which reﬂect economic con-
ditions and ﬁnancial stability. Firstly, monitoring ﬁnancial conditions and stability indicators
to provide a timely diagnosis of ﬁnancial crisis is necessary for eﬀective economic planning
and regulation. Furthermore, monitoring both types of indicators simultaneously is essential
in order to avoid ambiguous signals of a ﬁnancial turbulence. In particular, economists ar-
gue regarding the correct set of economic policies which are required to dampen the eﬀects of
recessions and help economies to follow a sustainable growth path.

Romer and Romer (1994) points out that opinions about ﬁscal policy range from “the view
that no recession has ever ended without ﬁscal expansion to the view that ﬁscal stimulus has
always come too late". Similarly, monetary policy and macroeconomic shocks can aﬀect ex-
pectations of economic agents. Therefore, monitoring FCIs provides useful insights regarding
the eﬀectiveness of monetary policies such as the level of the its impact on economic activity
and the improvement of economic conditions (see, Hatzius et al. (2010)). In particular, for the
case of US the low interest rates due to the US housing ﬁnance policy has been one of the
contributing factors triggering the LB ﬁnancial crisis and thus indicating the importance of
designing ﬂexible monetary policies and regulatory ﬁnancial policies to minimize the risks of
similar ﬁnancial events in the future.

Secondly, examining interest rates expectations in relation to forward rates is an additional
method to view the severity of ﬁnancial crisis through the lens of investors and consumers
expectations about economic conditions as well as a tool to identify regimes of economic and
monetary policies. According to Friedman (1979), the empirical literature has tested various
hypotheses about forward and expected future rates however no common consensus exists
due to the diﬃculty in evaluating market participants’ expectations. As a matter of fact,
the author’s empirical study show evidence of rejecting the pure expectations theory of the
term structure of the interest rates. According to the author the systemic variation of the
term structure is not independent of indicators of economic activity and monetary policy. The
aforementioned studies provide us with evidence that sequentially monitoring such ﬁnancial
time series should reveal similar behaviour to the FSIs.

Furthermore, as seen from our simulation study and the sequential monitoring of the ECIs
and FSIs, the eﬀectiveness or the negative impact of an economic policy can be seen from
the severity and the duration of the structural change. A structural change that lasted for
several months might be an indication of an economic policy (or monetary) not so antireces-
sionary. Romer and Romer (1994) ﬁnds evidence of large consistent declines on interest rates
during recessions. Thus, to demonstrate this ﬁnding, we sequentially monitor two measures of
inﬂation rates in the US, the 5 Year Breakeven Inﬂation Rate and the 5 Year Forward Inﬂa-
tion Expectations which permits to verify whether conclusions we obtain from the monitoring
procedure are consistent with relevant macroeconomic theory about monetary policies and
inﬂation expectations during periods of an economic crisis and prolonged uncertainty.

Our sequential break-point detection framework ﬁnds statistical evidence of a structural break
within the crisis interval of 2008 for both rates. Speciﬁcally, for the 5 Year Breakeven Inﬂation
Rate series, the structural break detected with the OLS-MOSUM (break due to changes in
the level of the series) on the 26/09/2008 is the date on which the Washington Mutual Bank
failure happened (largest failure in terms of assets, see e.g., Brave and Butters (2012)).

17

Therefore, our empirical ﬁndings verify the fact that during an economic crisis the inﬂation
rates and inﬂation expectations are severely aﬀected from available information about the
severity of the crisis and thus exhibiting structural instability. In other words, people tend to
form expectations with key macroeconomic relations; uncertainty about future inﬂation impose
higher uncertainty about future interest rates. Such regimes of structural change in interest
rates (i.e., severe decrease after the ﬁnancial crisis) can be seen on Figure 6 (for Euro area, UK
and US) and similarly to the EU government bond yields. While the former indices show the
changes in monetary policy (in accordance also with the inﬂation expectations) the latter verify
the deterioration of ﬁnancial instability in Europe after the Sovereign Debt crisis of 2010 and
their asymmetric eﬀects across European economies. Similar asymmetric eﬀects are found in
government yields as described by Giordano et al. (2012); such as evidence of time-dependent
contagion component in sovereign spreads and diﬀerent responses between core and peripheral
countries. More speciﬁcally, this occurs due to mispricing of actual ﬁnancial instability and
revision of market expectations in regards to the severity of the crisis.

In summary, since ﬁnancial stability and monetary policy are two distinct types of regula-
tory and macro-prudential polices a holistic view in addition to just interest rate policies is
required in order to understand possible contributing factors to an eﬀective ﬁnancial crisis
management such as a more rational banking management and corporate responsibility. For
example, Michail et al. (2016) emphasize through their ﬁndings that monetary policy have
no persistent impact on bank lending or bank credit risk taking thus lending decisions which
aﬀects the liquidity channel of banks should be explained otherwise. Another channel worth
examining is the risk management optimization through Sovereign debt restructuring (see e.g.,
Consiglio and Zenios (2015)6). According to Lane (2012), in the Euro area level, new ﬁnancial
reforms are recommended and implemented to better monitor the ﬁnancial stability of the Euro
area countries. Such policies include the monitor of a threshold for public debt levels, the use of
common Eurobonds to manage over-borrowing by weaker economies across Europe as well as
a dynamic collective ﬁnancial policy across Euro area calibrated in relation to macroeconomic
conditions. Furthermore, the cyclicality of the policies and the eﬀect of austerity measures
on helping economies to recover is a crucial dimension of the crisis management. In particu-
lar, Vegh and Vuletin (2014) examine extensively how policy responses in Latin America have
evolved over time (switching from procyclical to countercyclical). The author argues that the
policymakers response in some Eurozone countries is of early Latin America type; showing
that the implementation of procyclical ﬁscal policy in Eurozone had a negative economic im-
pact by amplifying the duration and severity of the current crisis. As a matter of fact the
aforementioned feedback loop is further fueled when there is inaction and uncertainty about
the economic policy that regulatory authorities will follow (see, Baker et al. (2016)).

6The authors use stochastic programming methodology to derive a model which accounts both the costs of
debt ﬁnancing and the associated risks aiming to choose a model for debt structure that has high probability
of sustainable debt management.

5 Conclusion

An investigation of the symptoms causing ﬁnancial and economic instability as well as unsus-
tainable economic growth can be considered as the ﬁrst stage of the problem identiﬁcation.
Emphasis should also be given to the next crucial stage, that is, the treatment and recovery
stage. This stage includes the true identiﬁcation of the factors and irregularities that can neg-
atively contribute to the emergence of a ﬁnancial and economic crisis. A careful examination
of ﬁnancial stress prevention and sustainable economic growth promotion policies is necessary
in order to prevent or mitigate the risk of crisis recurrence. Our study demonstrates some
important empirical and simulation ﬁndings, verifying related studies in the literature.

Firstly, the proposed sequential monitoring procedure such as the sequential monitoring of
standardized residuals based on US and European indicators has shown to be particularly ro-
bust, in comparison to the timing of the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008 in the US as well as the Sovereign
Stress crisis of 2010 in Europe. The underling behaviour of these indicators which might cause
any violations of the modelling assumptions does not appear to signiﬁcantly compromise the
predictive ability of the methodology, as also extensively examined with our simulation study.

Secondly, the theoretical examination of the properties of sequential processes and their asymp-
totic distributions as well as our simulation study and the empirical comparisons of the se-
quential processes through the computation of the power functions and ARLs give us useful
insights about the predictive performance of the detectors to identify structural instabilities in
the time movement of indicators and especially during the economic crisis of 2008. Speciﬁcally,
the robustness of the detectors depends on the size of the historical and monitoring periods as
well as the location of the structural change within the monitoring period. For example, empir-
ical ﬂuctuation processes such as OLS-CUSUM and RE perform better for early changes in the
monitoring period while the choice of the boundary function as well as the nature of ﬁnancial
data monitored (type of ﬂuctuations, smoothness of transition between regimes, existence of
volatility clustering) are further factors which can aﬀect the performance of the tests.

In particular, when the structural break was more severe with longer duration, then the tests
could detect the break-point location earlier that it actually happens due to higher ﬂuctuations
of the induced monitoring values which do not much the curvature of the boundary function.
Moreover, when these time series have a relative large conditional mean then a higher sampling
frequency and a longer monitoring period will be required (such as Moodys and VIX ﬁnancial
series) to correctly identify the break-point location. On the other hand, in the case of quite
low monitored values (e.g., when using standardized residuals of the Garch(1,1) model) a
recursive estimates detector seems to perform better than other sequential processes. Thus,
our empirical ﬁndings focus on sequentially monitoring regression residuals of level series as
well as monitoring Garch(1,1) residuals of ﬁrst diﬀerence series.

Furthermore, the impact of sampling frequency is worth examining with respect to the accuracy
of the empirical ﬂuctuation processes in detecting structural breaks. Although we use monthly
sampling frequency for the model estimation and monitoring of the indicators, an estimation
comparison of available monthly frequency series yields indeed better statistical signiﬁcance of
some of the model estimates, reduces standard errors and in the sequential monitoring cases it
give us more precise information regarding the dating of the break. Nevertheless, our study has
some limitations as well, which we should point out. The accuracy of the sequential procedure
depends on a correct model speciﬁcation; the existence of model misspeciﬁcation can aﬀect the
performance and robustness of the processes.

19

In our study we use a relative simple linear model and for the case of non-linear models we
consider the cases of Garch(1,1) and AR(1)-Garch(1,1); other stochastic volatility models for
example could be considered, to further examine structural instability in the volatility. Last
but not least, the uniqueness of these indicators lies on the fact that even though diﬀerent
construction methodologies are used in order to model the economic and ﬁnancial conditions
of highly heterogeneous markets their stochastic trend behaviour capture well the crisis events
and are highly informative regarding for example existence of volatility instability. Further
limitations of our study include the fact that we ﬁt the linear and non-linear time series
regression models to ﬁrst diﬀerenced time series observations. The particular practise implies
that the possible presence of nonstationarity can not be correctly modelled. We leave the
aspect of sequential monitoring under the presence of nonstationarity for future research.

In comparison to the already existing methodologies in the literature our proposed testing
framework is robust in terms of detection accuracy, parsimonious enough with no indication
of the presence of multicollinearity. For example the choice of an optimal lag as well as the
individual investigation of each indices ensures the avoidance of such econometric issues (see,
Oet et al. (2013)). Adding a dynamic component of to an EWM substantially improves the
quality of the results, such as it reduces false alarm ratio and increases the percentages of
correctly predicting the structural break. Our proposed framework has interesting extensions
supported with other novel econometric methods which can provide a suitable method for
capturing dynamic and time-varying patterns of macroeconomic and behavioural variables.

Given the global consequences of ﬁnancial crises, is crucial for interconnected economies to
collaborate and adopt common cross-border policies that can assess quickly and in a consis-
tent manner any early signs of ﬁnancial turbulence and thus take appropriate measures for
avoiding the transmission of systemic risks between ﬁnancial systems. Moreover, examining
the impact of these structural instabilities of economic and ﬁnancial conditions in relation to
other economic metrics (e.g., interest rates and inﬂation expectations) is essential in order to
implement appropriate ﬁnancial and monetary policies to ensure stability of the system.

Some further research worth mentioning include: (i) the endogenous estimation of conditional
volatility within-monitoring period and sequential extraction of standardized residuals, (ii)
the modelling of structural instability in continuous-time models (such as stochastic volatility
models), and (iii) the monitoring out-of sample economic conditions robust under the presence
of structural change in mean and conditional variance. An appropriate sequential process
along with a dynamic boundary function with a proven strong detecting ability can be chosen
to monitor ﬁnancial conditions using out-of sample data (real-time monitoring) providing this
way an early warning sign for upcoming ﬁnancial turbulence, so that appropriate correcting
measures and economic policy is designed and implemented in a timely manner.

6 Appendix

The Appendix of the paper presents main simulation, estimation and asymptotic theory re-
sults relevant to our econometric analysis. In particular, Appendix A presents main simulations
results for the Monte Carlo simulation study of the paper such as power simulations and sim-
ulated average run length of the detection of the break-point under the alternative hypothesis.
Appendix B presents the main estimation results of our empirical study which considers the
sequential monitoring of economic and ﬁnancial indicators before and after the 2008 ﬁnancial
crisis in US and Europe. Appendix C provides background asymptotic theory results and some
useful asymptotic results.

Simulations Results: All simulations results such as the empirical size under the null hy-
pothesis and the power under the alternative hypothesis as well as ARLs distributions under
the null and under the alternative hypothesis are carried out using the R package strucchange
with B = 2, 500 Monte Carlo replications.

Consider the model

yt = µ + ρyt−1 + ǫt, ǫt ∼

N (0, 1)

(6.1)

with i.i.d normally distributed errors, which produce a normally distributed response variable
with and mean diﬀerent than zero. Furthermore, tor the empirical ﬂuctuation processes, we use
a a signiﬁcance level α = 5%, with monitoring period 2 times the historical period (N = 2n), a
moving window h = 0.5 (for the ME and OLS-MOSUM) and rescaling for the estimates-based
processes (for the ME and RE test statistics).

Estimation Results: Statistical signiﬁcance of the estimates is denoted with the order:
“***” if p-value

0.05 and “*” if p-value

0.01,“**” if p-value

0.1.

The covariance matrix method employed for the computation of the standard errors of the
regression estimates is the HAC7(Newey-West) of ﬁxed 12 lags (for the monthly frequency
indicators). Similarly the parameter estimates of the Garch(1,1) and AR(1)-Garch(1,1) regres-
sion models with normally distributed innovations we report the robust standard errors, which
are calculated using the R package rugarch.

For unit root testing an ADF test is used as well as a unit root break point test with a
regression model with trend and intercept (in Eviews) and similar model for the retrospective
F-test. For the sequential (retrospective) detection of multiple breaks tests we used the Global
Information Criterion with maximum number of breaks to be 3 and a trimming percentage to
be 15%. For the standard process monitoring we report the OLS-CUSUM-SQ (in Eviews) and
for the sequential monitoring processes we report our estimates from our algorithm in R.

7In particular, the studies of Newey and West (1986) and Andrews (1991) propose a framework for the
covariance matrix construction of parameter estimators in linear and non-linear regression models in the presence
of heteroscedastisity and autocorrelation as well as the bandwidth estimators used to control convergence and
increase estimation accuracy.

Notes: Due to the existence of extreme values (especially during the period of economic crises of 2008)
the indicators are positively skewed with high kurtosis (in many cases more than 3, the kurtosis for
normally distributed data). The calculation of the trimmed mean (i.e., the mean after excluding the
10% extreme tails of the distribution of the indicators) signals the severity of the shocks to the expected
mean value of the ﬁnancial indicators, which is also shown by the high deviation of their maximum
values from the mean.

C Asymptotic Theory

The OLS-CUSUM test (Krämer et al. (1988)) belongs to the class of residual based statistics
(see, Stock (1994)) based on the partial sum process of regression residuals. We deﬁne a general
class of regression residuals based on the partial sum process (see, Kulperger et al. (2005)).

Deﬁnition 3. The m

We focus on the cases where m = 1 and m = 2 which represent functionals of the OLS-
CUSUM and OLS-CUSUM squared (see e.g., Deng and Perron (2008)). Furthermore, we omit
the proof of Theorem 2, which demonstrates a weak invariance principle, a stronger version
of Donsker’s classical functional central limit theorem (see, e.g., Kulperger et al. (2005) and
(Csörgő et al., 2003)). The limit theory related to the residual based tests and Wald type
statistics for detecting structural change is based on the implications of Theorem 2. In this
paper, we focus on functionals of the OLS-CUSUM test and their related limit theory. The
weakly convergence of the asymptotic distribution of the OLS-CUSUM statistic in the case of
the classical regression model is examined by Aue and Horváth (2013).
