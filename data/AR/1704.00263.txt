We report that the surface conductivity of Na2IrO3 crystal is extremely tunable by high energy
Ar plasma etching and can be tuned from insulating to metallic with increasing etching time. Tem-
perature dependent electrical transport for the metallic samples show signatures of ﬁrst order phase
transitions which are consistent with charge or spin density wave like phase transitions recently pre-
dicted theoretically. Additionally, grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) reveal
that the room temperature surface structure of Na2IrO3 does not change after plasma etching.

INTRODUCTION

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

5d transition metal oxides (TMO) are candidates for
novel magnetism1,2.
In 3d TMOs, electron correlation
(U) is the most signiﬁcant energy scale. However, for 5d
TMOs such as Ir-based oxides, spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
becomes comparable to U and plays an important role
in determining the electronic band structure and mag-
netism. For example, the novel Jef f = 1/2 state in the
perovskite iridate Sr2IrO4 arises from splitting of the t2g
level due to spin-orbit coupling3,4. Sr2IrO4 has garnered
a lot of recent attention due to its structural, electronic
2,3. Recently
and magnetic similarities with La2CuO4
insitu surface electron doping by potassium deposition
has been achieved, and it was found that Fermi arcs,
pseudogap, and a low-temperature d-wave gap exist for
these samples demonstrating properties in complete anal-
ogy with the cuprates5–7. These studies on Sr2IrO4 sug-
gest that properties of other iridates might also be highly
tunable. Recently the layered honeycomb lattice Iridates
A2IrO3 (A = Na, Li) have been recognized as spin-orbit
assisted Jef f = 1/2 Mott insulators1,8–10. The magnetic
frustration observed in these materials is argued to arise
from the presence of dominant bond-directional Kitaev-
like exchange interactions with additional Heisenberg ex-
change present10,11. Recent predictions have been made
of novel states emerging on doping the Kitaev-Heisenberg
model. These include topological superconductivity12,13,
spin/charge density waves, electronic dimerization insta-
bilities, and bond order instabilities14. This motivated
us to explore the properties of doped Na2IrO3 crystals.

Conventional doping in the bulk has not been success-
ful so far. We have however, recently discovered that the
surface of these crystals can be doped by Argon plasma
etching15.
In this paper, we reproduce surface doping
of Na2IrO3 crystals using reactive Ar ion etching and re-
port temperature and magnetic ﬁeld dependent electrical
transport studies on these RIE treated Na2IrO3 crystals.
We ﬁnd anomalies in the electrical transport properties
which are consistent with spin/charge density wave-like
phase transitions or structural transitions in these surface
doped Na2IrO3 crystals.

The single crystals of Na2IrO3 were grown using
self-ﬂux growth method described in detail elsewhere8.
Reactive-ion etching (RIE) technique was used to mod-
iﬁed the surface of the crystals. The freshly cleaved (in
air) crystals were bombarded with high energy Ar plasma
(in vacuum) for varying periods of time ranging from 0
to 30 min. The parameters used during plasma etch-
ing are given in Table I. The surface structure of the
crystals before and after RIE was checked using grazing
incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). The
transport measurement have been done using a Quan-
tum Design physical property measurement system. The
etched surface is found to be very sensitive to ambient
lab environment. The change in the transport behaviour
of etched samples is not permanent and reverts back to
insulating behaviour on exposure to ambient atmosphere.
The lab exposure time required for the samples to revert
back to their original behaviour depends on the time they
were etched for. For example, samples etched for longer
time (cid:118) 30 min and 40 min, degrade very fast, within
about two hours or so. Whereas, the crystals etched for
10 min degrade in 1 to 2 days. Additionally, it was found
that transport properties of the crystal surface opposite
to the etched surface remains unchanged. These observa-
tions suggest that only the surface of the Na2IrO3 crystal
is modiﬁed and most likely only a small depth close to
the top of the etched surface is aﬀected. Unfortunately
the depth of the surface layer aﬀected by the RIE is un-
known. For this reason we present electrical transport
data as sheet resistance.

III. RESULTS

A. Crystal Structure and Chemical Analysis

The grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering
(GISAXS) were done on the crystals before and after
the plasma etching. Results of these measurements are
displayed in Fig. 1. GISAXS reveals that the overall

surface structure of the crystals does not change after
plasma etching. A notable change is for the high an-
gle peak (32◦ - 34◦) which shifts to a smaller angle in
the plasma etched samples. This suggests an increase
in the unit cell parameters. This however, could not be
quantiﬁed with the current data. The depth D probed
during the GISAXS measurement can be estimated us-
ing the relation D = dsinθ, where d ≈ 1.25×10−3 cm
is the attenuation length for this sample at the used X-
ray energy of 15 keV, and θ = 0.1◦ is the x-ray incident
angle measured from the surface of the crystal. The esti-
mated depth comes out to be D ≈ 20 nm conﬁrming that
GISAXS is probing the surface structure of the samples.
Since the thickness of the surface layer modiﬁed by the
RIE is unknown and probably depends on the exposure
time of plasma etching, D estimated above can be used
as a lower limit. The chemical composition of the etched
surface was determined using the energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) on a JEOL scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM). The results from this analysis are shown in
Table II. From these results, we can conclude that Na is
being progressively removed from the surface of the sam-
ples with increasing exposure time to the plasma, which
leads to hole doping at surface of the crystal.

B. Electrical Transport

Due to the unknown geometrical factors involved in
the measurements, we present electrical transport for the
etched samples as sheet resistance Rs in the units Ω / sq.
A square sheet with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω/sq will
have a resistance 10 Ω.

The sheet resistance Rs versus temperature T data of
the pristine (unetched) samples and the samples etched

for various time periods, are shown in the Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3. Figure 2 (a) show the ρ versus T data of the
unetched Na2IrO3 single crystal between T = 50 and
305 K. The ρ(T ) data conﬁrms the insulating behavior
in the Na2IrO3 sample as has been reported earlier8. Fig-
ure 2 (b) shows the sheet resistance Rs versus T data for
the 10 minutes etched crystal recorded while cooling the
sample down from T = 305 K to 2 K and while warming
back up again. The Rs(T) versus T increases on cooling
from T = 305 K and reaches a broad maximum around
T = 100-200 K. Below the maximum Rs(T) behaves
like a metal with a weak T dependence. This unusual
behavior of transport is consistent with expectation for
topological insulators where the insulating bulk domi-
nates the transport at high temperature and the surface
states start contributing at lower temperatures when the
bulk gets gaped out. Such a topological state has been
predicted for the Na2IrO3 under certain conditions16,17.
The slight hysteresis in the warming and cooling curve is
not understood at present. We note that at the lowest
temperatures there is a small increase in the resistance.
We believe that this weak upturn is arising from weak

localization of the doped carriers due to the disorder in-
troduced by the RIE process. A non-monotonic electrical
transport behaviour is also sometimes observed due to a
crossover from a larger intrinsic gap at high temperatures
to a smaller dopant gap at low temperatures in doped
semiconductors or insulators. A prominent example of
18. Figure 3 (a) shows
this is the correlated insulator NiS2
Rs(T) data measured for the sample etched for 20 min-
utes, while cooling and warming in various applied mag-
netic ﬁelds H. The sheet resistance increases on cool-
ing below T = 305 K and reaches a maximum around
250 K. A step-like increase iis observed n the Rs(T) at
T0 = 220 K after which there is a rapid decrease in sheet
resistance suggesting metallic behaviour down to 20 K,
below which a slight increase in sheet resistance is ob-
served again. This upturn is stronger than observed for
the 10 min sample and will be consistent with a stronger
localization due to the increased disorder introduced due
to etching for longer times.

The Rs(T) behavior close to the transition is high-
lighted in the inset of Fig. 3 (a). At T0 the step-like

due to partial gaping of the Fermi surface19. The transi-
tion temperature at T0 also shows thermal hysteresis of

a ﬁrst order phase transition. The transition at T0 is ro-
bust in applied magnetic ﬁeld of up to H = 9 T as can
be seen in the Fig. 3 (a). The magnitude of the increase
in Rs(T) increases in applied magnetic ﬁelds as seen in

the inset of ig. 3 (a). Figure 3 (b) show the Rs(T) versus
T data for the sample etched for 30 minutes, measured
in zero magnetic ﬁeld while cooling and heating. The
sheet resistance increases on cooling below T = 305 K
and reaches a maximum around 250 - 270 K, after which
it continuously decreases down to T0 = 95 K. At T0 an
abrupt step-like decrease in Rs(T) by more than an or-
der of magnitude is observed and there is again a thermal
hysteresis between cooling and warming data indicating
the ﬁrst order nature of the transition. The Rs data
at low temperatures follows a T 2 dependence indicating
Fermi liquid behaviour. The T 2 ﬁt through the data is
shown in the inset in Fig. 3 (b). If the complete crystal
thickness (≈ 0.1 mm) is used in calculating the geometri-
cal factor for converting resistance into resistivity ρ then
the coeﬃcient of the T 2 dependence is estimated to be
A = 27 µΩ cm/K2. This value is comparable to values
obtained for Ce-based heavy Fermion compounds20.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have successfully shown that Ar plasma etching
can be used to eﬀectively dope the surface of Na2IrO3
crystals and that their electrical conductivity can be var-
ied all the way from insulating to metallic by control-
ling the etching time. The surface structure of Na2IrO3
does not change by plasma etching as revealed by graz-
ing incident small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). The

metallic samples are observed to show transport signa-
tures consistent with those observed for density wave
or structural transitions. Speciﬁcally, temperature de-
pendent sheet resistance Rs(T) for 20 and 30 minutes
etched samples show charge density wave like phase tran-
sitions with an abrupt change in Rs at T0 = 220 and 95
K, respectively as shown in the Fig. 3. Such transport
anomalies have been observed previously for CDW tran-
sitions in many other materials21–23. The phase transi-
tion is ﬁrst order as revealed by a 10 K thermal hystere-
sis between cooling and warming measurements. The
most metallic (30 minutes etched) sample follows a T2
Fermi liquid behavior at low temperature. Remarkably
such spin/charge density waves, electronic dimerization
instabilities, and bond order instabilities have been pre-
dicted on doping for antiferromagnetic Kitaev and ferro-
magnetic Heisenberg interaction12–14. However, surface
sensitive probes like electron diﬀraction or scanning tun-
nelling microscopy (STM) will be required to conﬁrm the
coupled electron density and structural modulations ex-
pected below a CDW transition19.
