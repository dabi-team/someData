time-consuming  cleanroom  process  that  requires  careful  sample 
preparation,  and  the  resulting  coating  is  typically  narrowband, 
which is not ideal for cascaded generation with a broadband input 
source. Another way to achieve AR over a broad bandwidth is by 
direct thermal nanoimprinting [9–11]. Due to the low glass transi-
tion temperature (Tg) of chalcogenide glasses (~160–280 °C) the 
process can be performed using simple heating elements, and takes 
only a few minutes to complete. 

Another critical aspect of coupling light to a chalcogenide fiber 
is avoiding damage when launching high peak power pulses. The 
simplest solution to allow for better power handling is to scale up 
the fiber core. However, when the core diameter is increased the 
nonlinearity of the fiber is reduced, thus hindering further extension 
of the spectrum. In order to increase the nonlinearity without sacri-
ficing the damage threshold, the fiber diameter can be gradually re-
duced along the propagation direction through thermal tapering, 
thus improving the MIR generation efficiency [12,13]. 

In this work we investigate these two thermal post–processing 
techniques, nanoimprinting and tapering, in order to improve the 
output power and bandwidth of cascaded SC sources. We chose to 
work with single–material Ge10As22Se68 PCF in order to avoid issues 
with varying Tg’s and viscosities between the core and cladding in 
step–index fibers (SIF). The pump source for the experiments was a 
SC source based on a master oscillator power  

Improved long–wavelength transmission and super–con-
tinuum (SC) generation is demonstrated by anti–reflective 
(AR)  nanoimprinting  and  tapering  of  chalcogenide  pho-
tonic crystal fibers (PCF). Using a SC source input spanning 
from 1–4.2 μm, the total transmission of a 15 μm core di-
ameter  PCF  was  improved  from  ~53  %  to  ~74  %  by 
nanoimprinting of AR structures on both input– and out-
put  facets  of  the  fiber.  Through  a  combined  effect  of  re-
duced reflection and red–shifting of the spectrum to 5 μm, 
the relative transmission of light >3.5 μm in the same fiber 
was increased by 60.2 %. Further extension of the spec-
trum to 8 μm was achieved using tapered fibers. The spec-
tral broadening dynamics and output power was investi-
gated using different taper parameters and pulse repeti-
tion rates. 

SC  light  sources  based  on  chalcogenide  glass  optical  fibers  are 
among the main candidates for enabling new and improved mid–
infrared photonic applications within broadband imaging and spec-
troscopy [1–3]. Currently, the most promising method for generat-
ing  SC  reaching  far  into  the  mid–infrared  fingerprint  region  is 
through so–called cascaded generation using a series of concate-
nated silica, fluoride, and chalcogenide fibers that gradually extend 
the spectrum from the near–infrared to the mid–infrared [4–7]. 

One critical point in particular is the coupling to– and from the 
chalcogenide fiber. Due to the high refractive index of chalcogenide 
glasses, a significant part of the pump light is reflected at the end fac-
ets, which means that both the input– and output power is substan-
tially reduced. One way to mitigate this is by using AR thin film coat-
ings such as Al2O3 or diamond deposited on the fiber end facets [8]. 
However, deposition of thin films on fiber facets is an elaborate and

amplifier  (MOPA)  configuration  with  a  variable  pulse  repetition 
rate and 1 ns pulse envelope [14]. The MOPA was used to pump a 7 
μm core diameter ZrF4–BaF2–LaF3–AlF3–NaF (ZBLAN) glass fiber 
generating a spectrum covering 1–4.2 μm. 

The principle of fiber nanoimprinting is depicted in Fig. 1(a). A 
nickel (Ni) mold with the negative structure is placed on a hot plate 
and heated to above the Tg of the chalcogenide glass (~175 °C [15]). 
For  more  details  regarding  the  fabrication  of  the  mold  see 
refs. [9,16]. The fiber is then pressed against the mold for a brief pe-
riod of time, after which the fiber is quickly released to allow for the 
imprinted structure to settle. Force was applied by manually mov-
ing a translation stage, and the combination of force, imprint time, 
and temperature enabled for varying degrees of structuring and de-
formation  of the  fiber. In  general,  higher  temperatures allow  for 
faster imprinting using low force, which also reduces the heat con-
duction to the rest of the fiber and thus reduces deformation. 
Fig. 1(b) shows the PCF used in the experiments, which has a 
core diameter of 15 μm and cladding diameter of 170 μm. The 
best  imprints  were  achieved  using  a  temperature  between 
230–250 °C applying a very small translation force for just a 
few seconds. Fig. 1(c) and 1(d) show high magnification scan-
ning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  images  of  the  imprinted 
structures, which were designed to have a pitch of 1050 nm 
and a height of around 1350 nm, providing  excellent anti–
reflection from 2.6–6.2 μm (<4 % reflection) peaking at 4 μm 
(<1 % reflection) [9,16]. The size of the structure meant that 
for wavelengths below ~2.2 μm the imprint acts as a diffrac-
tion grating, effectively scattering much of the light into the 
cladding. This effect is seen from the microscope image of Fig. 
2(b), which shows the chalcogenide fiber lighting up near the 
butt–coupling interface with the ZBLAN fiber from the pump 
source. It is also apparent from the image that the imprinting 
procedure in this case caused significant deformation of the 
fiber tip, resulting in a so–called elephant’s foot shape. How-
ever,  this  deformation affects mainly the outermost part of 
the cladding leaving the core area more or less intact except 
for some hole shrinkage, as is apparent from Fig. 1(c). The ef-
fect of

fiber tip deformation and hole shrinking on the output beam 
profile is seen when comparing the beam profiles of Fig. 2(c) 
and 2(d), which shows the near fields of the non–imprinted 
and  imprinted  fibers,  respectively.  The  near  field  images 
were captured using an uncooled PbSe camera covering from 
1–5  μm  wavelength  (Tachyon  6400,  NIT).  In  the  non–im-
printed fiber output beam the PCF structure is clearly seen, 
while the imprinted output beam shows a significant distor-
tion of the air–cladding structure while maintaining a circu-
lar core–guided mode. Note that the intensity scale on the fig-
ures  is  logarithmic  in  order  to  clearly  see  the  air–hole  pat-
terns. By optimizing the temperature, pressure, and imprint-
ing time it was possible to reduce the fiber tip deformation 
while maintaining a full imprint of the structure, but it was 
found to have no influence on the transmission since the core 
area is seemingly unaffected by the deformation. To measure 
the output spectra the PCF output was butt–coupled to a 150 
μm core diameter chalcogenide patch cable (IRF–Se–150, IR 
Flex) and guided to a grating–based  spectrometer covering 
from  0.2–5  μm  (Spectro  320,  Instrument  Systems).  From 
comparing the red output spectrum of the non–imprinted fi-
ber in Fig. 2(a) to the purple and blue output spectra of the 
1–face (output) and 2–face imprinted fiber, respectively, it is 
clear that a significant fraction of the light  below 2.2  μm is 
lost due to diffraction. Such properties could potentially be 
useful  for  reducing  the  linear  and  nonlinear  absorption  of 
shorter  wavelengths,  in  particular  two-photon  absorption, 
which  may  improve  the  power  handling.  It  is  also  evident 
from the spectra that the long–wavelength transmission was 
improved after imprinting. In order to quantify the improve-
ment the total output power and output power after a 3.5 μm 
long–pass filter (LPF) was

measured for the non–imprinted and the 2–face imprinted fi-
bers. Many fiber samples with similar lengths around 20–30 
cm were prepared and measured, and because the imprinting 
was performed manually the results varied from producing 
only minor or no improvement in transmission, to even re-
ducing the output power compared to the non–imprinted ref-
erence. However, some samples also produced a significant 
increase in transmission, and these results are presented in 
Table 1. The total transmission improvement (ΔT) between 
the non–imprinted and 2–face imprinted fibers ranged from 
7.0–27.9 % and the maximum total transmission (T) was 73.8 
%.  As  seen from  the orange  curve of Fig. 2(a), a  significant 
part of the pump spectrum is below the diffraction limit of the 
imprinted  structure,  so  the  transmission  increase  >3.5  μm 
was  also  measured  and  found  to  range  from  12.3–60.2  % 
with a maximum transmission of 98.4 %. However, this ex-
tremely high value is attributed to a combination of both re-
duced  reflection  and  increased  red–shifting  of  wavelength 
components below 3.5 μm due to the higher transmission. 
     Previous work  with fiber nanoimprinting has focused on 
large-core  multi-mode  As2S3  SIFs  (50-100  μm  core  diame-
ters) [11], and so it was not clear whether the micron scale 
structures and especially the fiber tip deformation would af-
fect transmission of smaller core fibers. In that respect, this 
work represents the first demonstration of AR nanoimprint-
ing  of a  single-mode chalcogenide PCF,  achieving  increased 
transmission in a fiber suitable for SC generation without sig-
nificantly affecting the core mode of the fiber. Despite the in-
creased transmission and red–shifting in the imprinted fibers 
the  spectral  extent  was  limited  to  5  μm,  so  in  order  to  in-
crease the bandwidth even further, fiber tapering was for the 
first  time  to  the  authors’  knowledge  investigated  for  cas-
caded SCG. In a previous study on SC in tapered chalcogenide 
PCFs [12] using direct pumping it was found that the length 
of uniform fiber before (Lb) and after (La) the tapered fiber 
section  (Lt)  greatly influenced the bandwidth obtained, but 
the influence of the tapered core diameter was never fully ex-
plored.  Here  we  have  investigated  the  influence  of  the  ta-
pered  core  diameter  (dc)  in  five  different  tapered  fibers, 
whose parameters are summarized in Table 2.

All tapers were designed to have around 2.5 cm adiabatic ta-
per transitions. When the fiber core is reduced the zero–dis-
persion wavelength (ZDW) is shifted towards shorter wave-
lengths from around 4.9 μm at the initial 15 μm diameter to 
around 3.6–4 μm at 6–7.5 μm diameter, respectively [12]. But 
while the reduced ZDW allow for more pump power to cou-
ple into the anomalous dispersion regime for improved SCG 
efficiency, the confinement loss edge is also pushed towards 
shorter wavelengths, which introduces a trade–off between 
efficiency and long–wavelength loss. Fig. 3(a) shows the re-
sulting  spectra from  pumping  tapers  A–E  with  around  270 
mW  of  average  power  at  1  MHz  pulse  repetition  rate.  The 
spectra were measured using a fiber–coupled Fourier–tran-
form infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (FOSS, custom) covering 
from 2.8–14 μm. The total transmission of the non-imprinted 
tapers  A–D  varied  from  31–38  %,  with  the  highest  output 
power of 103 mW achieved for taper D.

Despite the differences in taper parameters, tapers A–C pro-
duced  very  similar  output  spectra reaching  up  to  around 8 
μm at the –30 dB level, while taper D was limited to 7.5 μm

In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time im-
proved transmission and broadening in cascaded SC genera-
tion  through  nanoimprinting  and  tapering  of  Ge10As22Se68 
chalcogenide  PCFs.  The  maximum  total  transmission  of  a 
nanoimprinted uniform fiber was increased by 27.9 % rela-
tive to the non–imprinted fiber, and the average power >3.5 
μm  was  increased  by  up  to  60.2  %.  By  tapering  a  non-im-
printed 15 μm core PCF down to a core diameter of 7 μm over 
a 12 cm section a spectrum covering up to ~8 μm with 90 mW 
output power and 25.8 mW >3.5 μm was achieved. By com-
bining the two post–processing methods we expect that the 
output power can be increased to more than 120 mW with 
more than 40 mW above 3.5 μm without damaging the fiber. 
Such power levels would enable applications such as optical 
coherence  tomography  to  push  further  into  the  mid–IR  for 
improved inspection of ceramics, coatings, polymers, and fi-
ber–reinforced composites [19].

and  exhibited  significantly  lower  flatness  compared  to  the 
three  others.  For  a  7.5  μm  core  diameter  the  ZDW  is  esti-
mated to be around 4 μm, which is exactly where we see a dip 
in the output spectrum of taper D. Such a dip followed by a 
peak  or  pedestal  of  lower  intensity  is  commonly  observed 
when pumping in the normal dispersion region close to the 
ZDW [17,18]. Since the SC pump starts to cut off at around 4 
μm the solitons coupled into the PCF will initially experience 
normal dispersion and therefore only the part that broadens 
into  the  anomalous  dispersion  via  self–phase  modulation 
(SPM) will then contribute to the long–wavelength edge. As a 
result the amount of power >3.5 μm is only ~21 % in taper D 
(22.2 mW) compared to ~29 % in taper C (25.8 mW). 

To investigate whether the spectral extension was limited 
by  the  taper  length,  another  taper  denoted  Taper  E  was 
tested. Taper E has the same 6 μm core diameter as taper A, 
but twice  the tapered section length and a longer  length of 
uniform fiber before the taper. It is seen in Fig. 3(a) that the 
longer taper improves the long–wavelength generation, but 
reduces  the  output  power  significantly  due  to  increased 
losses. Fig. 3(b) shows the entire taper E output spectrum at 
~350 mW pump power (41 mW output power), where max-
imum broadening was observed covering from 1.07–7.94 μm 
at the –20 dB level. Further increasing the pump power did 
not  improve  the  long–wavelength  edge,  as  seen  from  the 
trend in Fig. 4(a), which shows that for these pump and taper 
parameters the broadening is limited to around 8 μm.

power  (brackets:  power  >3.5  μm).  (b)  Output  power  degrada-
tion in Taper C during 116.5 hour testing. 

This behavior was found in all of the tapers tested, which sug-
gests that further broadening is limited mainly by the soliton 
dynamics of the MOPA source and ZBLAN fiber rather than 
confinement loss or dispersion in the tapers [5,7]. Lastly, the 
output power stability was tested. Note that at the point of 
this measurement (4 months later) taper C had degraded sig-
nificantly due to exposure to ambient lab conditions [15], and 
so the obtainable bandwidth and output power was reduced. 
The insert shows the degradation in output power during a 
116.5 hour continuous power stability measurement, and ad-
justing the coupling did not improve the output power. This 
highlights  the  need  for  proper  sealing  of  the  optical  facets, 
which could for instance be realized by either fully collapsing 
the  air–holes,  or  by  splicing  an  unstructured  fiber  end–cap 
onto the PCF prior to imprinting.
