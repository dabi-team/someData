ABSTRACT

Context. We present a detailed analysis of an eruptive event that occurred on early 2019 March 8 in active region AR 12734, to
which we refer as the International Women’s day event. The event under study is intriguing in several aspects: 1) low-coronal eruptive
signatures come in “pairs” (i.e. there is a double-peak ﬂare, two coronal dimmings, and two EUV waves); 2) although the event is
characterized by a complete chain of eruptive signatures, the corresponding coronagraphic signatures are weak; 3) although the source
region of the eruption is located close to the center of the solar disc and the eruption is thus presumably Earth-directed, heliospheric
signatures are very weak with little Earth-impact.
Aims. In order to understand the initiation and evolution of this particular event, we perform a comprehensive analysis using a
combined observational-modeling approach.
Methods. We analyze a number of multi-spacecraft and multi-instrument (both remote-sensing and in situ ) observations, including
Soft X-ray, (extreme-) ultraviolet (E)UV), radio and white-light emission, as well as plasma, magnetic ﬁeld and particle measure-
ments. We employ 3D nonlinear force-free (NLFF) modeling to investigate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in and around
the active region, the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model to make a 3D reconstruction of the CME geometry and the 3D mag-
netohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical model EUHFORIA (EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset) to model the
background state of the heliosphere.
Results. Our results reveal a two-stage C1.3 ﬂare, associated with two EUV waves that occur in close succession and two-stage
coronal dimmings that evolve co-temporal with the ﬂare and type II and III radio bursts. Despite its small GOES class, a clear drop in
magnetic free energy and helicity is observed during the ﬂare. White light observations do not unambiguously indicate two separate
CMEs but rather a single entity most likely composed of two sheared and twisted structures corresponding to the two eruptions
observed in the low corona. The corresponding interplanetary signatures are that of a small ﬂux rope (SFR) with indications of strong
interactions with the ambient plasma which result in negligible geomagnetic impact.
Conclusions. Our results indicate two subsequent eruptions of two systems of sheared and twisted magnetic ﬁelds, which merge
already in the upper corona and start to evolve further out as a single entity. The large-scale magnetic ﬁeld signiﬁcantly inﬂuences
both, the early and the interplanetary evolution of the structure. During the ﬁrst eruption the stability of the overlying ﬁeld was
disrupted which enabled the second eruption. We ﬁnd that during the propagation in the interplanetary space the large-scale magnetic
ﬁeld, i.e. , the location of heliospheric current sheet (HCS) between the AR and the Earth likely inﬂuences propagation and the
evolution of the erupted structure(s).

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most
powerful events in our solar system. They come in various sizes
and ﬂavors, and are a direct manifestation of instabilities of the
strong magnetic ﬁelds concentrated in sunspots and active re-
gions. The current paradigm is that both may be related to the
eruption of a sheared magnetic arcade or a ﬂux rope (Patsourakos
et al. 2020), i.e. a magnetic structure with ﬁeld lines helicoidally
winding around a central axis. In support, CMEs are often ob-
served to be ﬁlled with helical magnetic ﬁeld, indicative of a
magnetic ﬂux rope being carried away from the Sun (e.g., Chen
2011). As the ﬂux rope erupts, free magnetic energy that was
built up is impulsively released and the surrounding magnetic
ﬁeld rearranged (Priest & Forbes 2002; Fletcher et al. 2011;
Benz 2017; Green et al. 2018; Temmer 2021).

CMEs may be accompanied by large-scale propagating dis-
turbances, EUV waves, which are most commonly interpreted as
coronal large-amplitude fast-mode MHD waves or shocks, initi-
ated by the impulsive lateral expansion of the CME ﬂanks (e.g.
Veronig et al. 2008; Warmuth 2015; Long et al. 2017; Veronig
et al. 2018), although other interpretations do exist (e.g. Chen
& Wu 2011; Chandra et al. 2018). A subset of EUV waves is
accompanied by type II radio bursts, i.e. slowly drifting bands
of radio emission observed in dynamic spectra, which are signa-
tures of shock waves traveling outwards through the corona and
interplanetary space (Warmuth 2015), and are closely related to
CMEs (Vršnak & Cliver 2008). Another relatively common low
coronal signature of the eruption are coronal dimmings, which
are reﬂections of the expansion of coronal ﬁelds and mass de-
pletion associated with CMEs (Hudson et al. 1996; Thompson
et al. 1998; Dissauer et al. 2018b, 2019; Chikunova et al. 2020).
It has been shown that the localized core dimming regions tend
to be rooted at the footpoints of the ejected ﬂux rope (Sterling
& Hudson 1997; Webb et al. 2000; Temmer et al. 2017; Veronig
et al. 2019), and that the spatio-temporal evolution of the dim-
ming regions provides insight into the initiation and early evolu-
tion of the eruption (Miklenic et al. 2011; Prasad et al. 2020), as
well as into the interaction of the ﬂux rope footpoints with the
surrounding magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Lörinˇcík et al. 2021).

Flare properties can outline footprints of a ﬂux rope (e.g.
Janvier et al. 2014a). Although there seems to be no tendency
showing that large ﬂares are preferentially associated with EUV
waves (Nitta et al. 2013; Muhr et al. 2014; Long et al. 2017),
there is a distinct relation between the ﬂare reconnection ﬂuxes
and magnetic ﬂuxes covered by dimming regions (Dissauer et al.
2018b). On the other hand, there is no one-to-one relation be-
tween CMEs and ﬂares. The so-called stealth CMEs can occur
without solar ﬂares, or any other low coronal signatures (Rob-
brecht et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2010; Nitta & Mulligan 2017) and
so-called conﬁned ﬂares are not accompanied by CMEs (Svestka
1986; Schmieder et al. 2015; Li et al. 2020). There seems to be
a tendency that large ﬂares are associated with CMEs, whereas
small ﬂares are conﬁned. As shown in Yashiro et al. (2006), the
CME-association is a steeply increasing function of ﬂare im-
portance class, with >90% of X-class ﬂares accompanied by a
CME, while only about 10% of C1 class ﬂares are associated
with a CME. However, there exist also notable exceptions to this
general trend, such as active region (AR) 12192, which was the
source of 6 X- and 30 M-class ﬂares during October 2014, out of
which only one ﬂare was associated to a CME (Thalmann et al.
2015; Sun et al. 2015; Veronig & Polanec 2015).

Nevertheless, there seems to be a general trend that more
energetic CMEs occur in close association with powerful ﬂares

and the restructuring of the overlying ﬁelds is ultimately related
to various wave and wave-like signatures in the low corona (see
also Hudson 2011, and references therein). In addition, due to
the feedback relationship between the CME dynamics and the re-
connection process, such CMEs would tend to be more massive,
and thus more likely to have pronounced white light signatures in
the upper corona and interplanetary space (Colaninno & Vourl-
idas 2009; Howard & Tappin 2009). Finally, when such CMEs
have source region close to the central meridian, they are more
likely to hit the near-Earth spacecraft head-on, and thus tend
to produce pronounced magnetic cloud signatures, i.e. a low-
temperature structure with smoothly rotating enhanced magnetic
ﬁeld and linearly decreasing plasma speed (e.g. Kilpua et al.
2017a, and references therein). Magnetic clouds tend to pro-
duce the strongest geomagnetic eﬀects, as they are more likely
to carry a long-lasting enhanced south oriented magnetic ﬁeld
needed to produce a geomagnetic storm (Kilpua et al. 2017b).
Indeed, statistical studies have shown that fast CMEs associ-
ated with large ﬂares with source regions close to the central
meridian are more likely to be more geo-eﬀective (Srivastava
& Venkatakrishnan 2004; Dumbovi´c et al. 2015; Scolini et al.
2018), as well as CMEs which host strong magnetic ﬂux from
dimming areas (Chertok et al. 2013). In addition, highly geo-
eﬀective CMEs are often associated with strong interplanetary
type II radio bursts with low end frequency (Vasanth et al.
2015). However, we note that these general trends do not mean
that all strong ﬂares and energetic CMEs will result in extreme
space weather events. As already discussed, and also shown by
Schmieder et al. (2020), exceptions to this generalization do ex-
ist.

In this paper, we study an intriguing event which seems to
oppose several of the general tendencies described above, a small
double-peaked C1.3 ﬂare that occurred under solar minimum
conditions on 2019 March 8 (SOL-2019-03-08T03:07C1.3), the
International Woman’s Day event. Despite its low GOES class,
the ﬂare was associated with a plethora of phenomena typical for
solar eruptions, including coronal dimmings, two EUV waves,
type II and III bursts and two coronal loop ejections, which
come in “pairs”. Although the event is characterized by very
pronounced low coronal signatures, the observed white light sig-
natures in the upper corona and interplanetary space are quite
weak. This is perhaps not uncommon for a small ﬂare, but is
surprising given that the event has a complete chain of eruptive
signatures, which, according to some general tendencies, should
indicate a strong eruption. Moreover, the event had a very low
impact on the near-Earth environment, although it was Earth-
directed. We study in detail the initiation and early evolution
of the event, with a particular focus on the two-step process re-
vealed in both, the ﬂare energy release and the diﬀerent eruption
signatures. Finally, we follow its faint traces into interplanetary
space and investigate its potential in situ detection and eﬀects at
1 AU.

aspects of the event

2.1. Active Region and ﬂare overview

NOAA AR 12734 emerged during 2019 March 3–4 around the
heliographic position N10E40 and during its passage over the
solar disk had low ﬂare productivity. During its lifetime, it pro-
duced only two small ﬂares: a C1.3 ﬂare on 2019 March 8
(SOL-2019-03-08T03:07C1.3) and a B6.2 ﬂare on 2019 March 9
(SOL-2019-03-09T12:26B6.2). Here we study in detail the C1.3

GOES 1–8 Å SXR emission (black curve), the time derivative of the GOES 0.5–4 Å emission (blue curve), and the NOAA AR 12734 area-
integrated AIA 1600 Å emission (green) normalized to the pre-ﬂare state at 03:00:23 UT. The gray-shaded vertical band marks the extended
impulsive phase of the C1.3 ﬂare, covering the time span between the nominal GOES start time and the time of the second peak in the GOES

ﬂare that occurred at N09W13, and the plethora of eruptive phe-
nomena associated despite its small GOES importance class. The
ﬂare showed two peaks in the GOES soft X-ray lightcurves (see
Fig. 1), indicative of two episodes of energy release.

Fig. 1 shows the time evolution of the soft X-ray (SXR) and
ultraviolet (UV) emission of the ﬂare under study. The full-
disk GOES 1–8 Å SXR ﬂux (black curve) reveals two peaks,
one around 03:18 UT and a subsequent one around 03:37 UT.
The double-peak structure is also observed in the area-integrated
UV emission derived from SDO/AIA 1600 Å ﬁltergrams (green
line). The AIA 1600 Å light curve evolves co-temporally with
the time derivative of the GOES 0.5–4 Å SXR ﬂux, indicative
of the Neupert eﬀect relating the non-thermal and thermal ﬂare
emissions (Neupert 1968; Veronig et al. 2005; Qiu 2021). The
two peaks in these curves are indicative of two episodes in the
ﬂare energy release process, separated by about 20 min.

The overall magnetic pattern of AR 12734 can be character-
ized as quadrupolar, as two bipolar groups can be identiﬁed, a
leading and a following one (see top panels in Fig. 2). This is
a relatively rare conﬁguration, as was shown by Toriumi et al.
(2017). The total area covered by sunspots, at the time when
AR 12734 hosted the C1.3 ﬂare, was about 20 MSH, i.e. , char-
acteristic for ARs that typically produce only ﬂares below GOES
class M1.0 (e.g., Fig. 4 of Toriumi et al. 2017). The AR con-
tained a total unsigned magnetic ﬂux of ≈ 4.5 × 1021 Mx, which
is rather small, even for an AR producing only C-class ﬂares and
smaller (e.g., Fig. 8 of Kazachenko et al. 2017).

On the day before the C1.3 ﬂare, on March 07 at 07:44 UT,
a small ﬁlament is observed in synoptic Hα images1 from the
Kanzelh´’ohe Solar Observatory. These Hα observations support
that a single extended (or a number of smaller individual) ﬂux
rope(s) existed prior to the onset of the C-class ﬂare, aligned with
the solar east-west direction and connecting the leading sunspot
in the west of AR 12734 with the extended plage region to its
east.

Inspection of the (E)UV emission features within the host
AR allows us to establish the link to the underlying ﬂare pro-
cess (cf. Fig. 2 and accompanying movie). During stage one of
the C1.3 ﬂare, covering the time span ∼03:07 UT–03:20 UT, the
coronal ﬁeld of the leading (western) sunspot of AR 12734 was
destabilized. Distinct ﬂare kernels appeared ﬁrst to the north-
east (“K1”) and north (“K2”) of the leading sunspot. The north-
eastern one developed into an eastward progressing ﬂare rib-
bon (“R1”). Simultaneously, EUV observations reveal loop-like
structures erupting towards solar west (marked by large white
arrow in the bottom let panel). During this ﬁrst stage of the ﬂare,
which largely destabilized the western part of the AR, we also
notice a narrow ejection that originated from the north-east of
the AR, at a location where the observed ribbon R1 roughly ter-
minates (indicated by a small arrow in the AIA 94 Å ﬁltergram
at 03:11:36 UT).

However, only during stage two of

the ﬂare (after
∼03:20 UT), the corona in and around the eastern part of the AR
fully destabilized (involving also that part of the AR in which
the narrow ejection has been observed before; see right column

The panels in the two columns correspond to the two phases of the double peak ﬂare and two eruptions from the same NOAA AR 12734. Namely,
snapshots are shown at two time steps corresponding to the ﬁrst (around 03:12 UT; left column) and second (around 03:30 UT; right column)
ﬂare-related eruption. Top to bottom rows show HMI line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld maps, AIA 1600, 304, 171, 211, and 94 Å ﬁltergrams. Labels
“K1” and “K2” in AIA 1600 Å ﬁltergrams refer to locations of ﬂare kernels; labels “R1” and ‘R2” in AIA 304 Å ﬁltergrams to corresponding
ﬂare ribbons. Large white arrows in the AIA 94 Å ﬁltergrams point to the location of erupting loops during stage one and two of the ﬂare process,
respectively. The small arrow in the bottom left AIA 94 Å ﬁltergram points to the location of a narrow ejection to the north-east direction during
the ﬁrst stage. A movie accompanying the ﬁgure is available in the electronic material (movie1).

in Fig. 2). During this stage, the ﬂare kernel and ribbon emis-
sion that developed during the early stages of the ﬂare further
progressed towards solar east, while another ﬂare ribbon formed
to the south of it (“R2”). Simultaneously, expanding loop-like
structures are observed in the Eastern part of the AR (see large
white arrow in the bottom right panel).

These observations indicate that the two successive recon-
nection events during the double-peak C-class ﬂare are causally
connected (see movie accompanying Fig. 2), i.e. , are indicative
of so-called sympathetic ﬂares/eruptions. After the two-stage
ﬂare process, during which ﬁrst the western and subsequently
the eastern active-region corona was destabilized, the post-ﬂare
corona appears to be still highly non-potential. This is notice-
able in the form of apparently highly sheared and/or twisted
EUV loops observed after the nominal end time of the ﬂare at
03:58 UT (see movie associated to Fig. 2). Importantly, the ﬂare-
related reconﬁguration appears to have eﬀected mainly the coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld that bridged the ﬁlament channel, as the latter
is still clearly visible (and has even grown) in Hα observations2
at about four hours after the ﬂare occurred. An available online
movie, covering the time span ∼07:39 UT to ∼15:10 UT sug-

gests that the ﬁlament channel “survived” the eruptions related
to the C-class ﬂare under study3.

Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the event as observed by
the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EUVI; Wuelser
et al. 2004) onboard STEREO-A (Kaiser et al. 2008). On
2019 March 8, the longitude of STEREO-A was −98.1◦ with re-
spect to the Sun-Earth line, and thus STEREO-A observed the
eruptions associated with the ﬂare (located at solar N09W13
from Earth view) almost perfectly on the Western limb. The
EUVI 195 Å running diﬀerence images in Fig. 3 show two subse-
quent eruptions, which can be identiﬁed as the two loop ejections
observed in projection against the disk by SDO/AIA (see Fig. 2).
The ﬁrst eruption observed by EUVI (top panels in Fig. 3) re-
lates to the ejection that destabilized the western part of the AR
corona, as observed in SDO/AIA, whereas the second one (bot-
tom panels of Fig. 3) relates to the ejection that aﬀected mainly
the eastern part of the AR, as observed in SDO/AIA. It can be
seen in Fig. 3 that the second eruption initiated higher up in the
corona compared to the ﬁrst one (see also accompanying movie
to Fig. 3).

211 Å image. Model ﬁeld lines are drawn from randomly selected footpoints and color-coded according to the mean absolute vertical current
density at both footpoints.

2.2. AR magnetic structure and evolution

We investigate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in and
around AR 12734 using the static 3D nonlinear force-free
(NLFF) model (for a review see, e.g., Wiegelmann & Sakurai
2012, and see Appendix A for the method used in this study).
The pre-ﬂare NLFF model at 02:59 UT reveals diﬀerent mag-
netic connectivity domains (Fig. 4), which were selected for vi-
sualization based on the observations presented in Sect. 2.1, i.e. ,
assumed to represent the coronal magnetic ﬁeld overlying the
ﬁlament channel observed in Hα. Thus, the overall shape of the
modeled AR core ﬁeld coincides with the coronal loops observed
in the EUV images (Fig. 2) which got partially involved during
the successive ﬂare-related eruptions.

On the one hand, twisted magnetic ﬁeld (oriented in a north-
southward direction) connects the leading negative-polarity
sunspot to the positive-polarity area in the north-west (NW) of
the AR (see reddish-colored sample ﬁeld lines in Fig. 4a). On
the other hand, a system of sheared ﬁeld (also oriented in a north-
southward manner) connects the north-eastern (NE) plage region
to the smaller negative-polarity ﬁeld in the south-east (SE) of the
AR. The two aforementioned systems are connected by magnetic
ﬁeld along the NE-SW direction. The latter appears to represent
the main orientation of the underlying magnetic dipole ﬁeld (the

overarching ﬁeld is represented by the black lines in Fig. 4a). In
contrast to the much more potential (thus, more vertical) enve-
lope ﬁeld, the more complex magnetic ﬁeld in the AR core is
concentrated at heights below (cid:46) 20 Mm (see Fig. 4b). The mag-
netic ﬁeld associated to the leading sunspot (beyond x ≈ 70 Mm
in Fig. 4c) suggests the existence of a twisted magnetic ﬁeld of
positive handedness, and sheared arcades associated to the plage
region covering the eastern part of the AR.

In order to analyze the time evolution of the coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld in response to the C1.3 ﬂare, we compute the total
and free magnetic energy budgets as well as the relative magnetic
helicity, based on a series of NLFF models, during a ∼ 12 hour
time interval centered around the C-class ﬂare. The total mag-
netic energy (E) indicates the overall corresponding amount be-
ing present in the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, while the free mag-
netic energy (EF) represents an upper limit for the magnetic
energy which can be liberated via reconnection processes. The
total relative helicity (HV) is a gauge-invariant measure for the
geometrical complexity of the magnetic ﬁeld within the ﬁnite
coronal volume (e.g., Berger & Field 1984; Finn & Antonsen
1985, and see Appendix A for the computational method used in
this study). Furthermore, the contribution of the current-carrying
(non-potential) magnetic ﬁeld alone (HJ) can also be meaning-
fully computed (Berger 2003). In agreement to the visual im-

clear response to the C1.3 ﬂare. In particular, we notice a grad-
ual (step-wise) decrease starting already about one hour prior
to the start of the ﬂare. After the ﬂare, it takes about one hour
to regain a characteristic pre-ﬂare level of E. More pronounced
changes are found in the time proﬁle of the free magnetic en-
ergy, which comprises (cid:46) 10 % of the total energy (Fig. 5c). We
observe a sudden decrease of the free magnetic energy during
the C1.3 ﬂare by ∆EF ≈ 8 × 1029 erg. After the ﬂare, it takes less
than one hour to regain, and even to exceed, the characteristic
pre-ﬂare level of EF (cid:39) 2.5 × 1030 erg, indicating a rather fast
replenishment.

The time evolution of the coronal magnetic helicity, HV, is
similar to that of E, also showing a step-wise decrease prior to
the C1.3 ﬂare (Fig. 5b). In contrast to E, the replenishment of
magnetic helicity appears to happen on a longer time scale, re-
quiring about three hours to regain a characteristic pre-ﬂare level
of HV (cid:39) 2.0 × 1041 Mx2. Notable changes in the time proﬁle of
the current-carrying (non-potential) helicity component, HJ, are
detected as early as two hours prior to the start of the C1.3 ﬂare,
with a value of HJ (cid:39) 5 × 1039 Mx2 about two hours prior to
the ﬂare (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we ﬁnd a ﬂare-related change
∆HJ ≈ 1.7 × 1039 Mx2, involving reversal of the sign of HJ.
More precisely, we ﬁnd that the pre-ﬂare corona is characterized
by positive values of HJ, which is drastically reduced during the
C1.3 ﬂare, resulting in values of HJ nearly zero just after the ex-
tended impulsive phase of the ﬂare. The ﬂare-related changes of
HJ suggest the ejection of magnetic structures that have, on over-
all, a positive handedness. Analogously as for HV, also for HJ it
takes about three hours to regain values similar to the pre-ﬂare
corona.

For completeness we note that, though not explicitly shown,
the NLFF magnetic ﬁeld models in the post-ﬂare phase own to
a complexity of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, similar to that of the
pre-ﬂare corona. In other words, the post-ﬂare model corona also
appears strongly non-potential in nature, with highly sheared
and/or twisted magnetic ﬁeld spanning the active-region core (as
observed in coronal observations, described in Sect. 2.1).

2.3. Coronal dimmings

The coronal dimmings caused by the eruptions associated with
the C1.3 ﬂare are analyzed using high-cadence SDO/AIA 211 Å
images. To extract the dimming regions, we use the threshold-
ing method applied to logarithmic base-ratio images described
in Dissauer et al. (2018a), dividing each frame of the series by
a base image recorded at 02:39 UT. For the segmentation of the
dimming masks, we apply a logarithmic threshold of −0.38, and
calculate the corresponding areas on the spherical solar surface.
Our focus lies on the spatial distribution of the dimming regions
and their time evolution, both with respect to the two-step be-
havior of the ﬂare under study.

Fig. 6 and the accompanying movie show the development
of the coronal dimming region in the original SDO/AIA 211 Å
ﬁltergrams, the corresponding logarithmic base ratio images and
the derived detection masks. The movie shows slow changes al-
ready at 03:00 UT. At about 03:10 UT, we can see two distinct
dimming kernels low in the corona close to the AR core and two
at its Western edge. In particular the Northern kernel at about
(x,y)=(20(cid:48)(cid:48),280(cid:48)(cid:48)) is clearly observed to be the footpoint of erupt-
ing large loops (see the AIA 211 Å direct images in the movie).
Thereafter, two extended dimming regions are formed, respec-
tively, at the eastern and western edges of the AR, corresponding
to the location where the observed ﬂare ribbons terminate (com-

(Fig. 5d).

pared to AIA 304 images in third row of Fig. 2). Notably, the
main dimming evolution also shows a distinct two-step behavior,
with ﬁrst the western dimming region growing and thereafter the
eastern one. This characteristics is also clearly seen in the timing
map shown in the top panel of Fig. 7, where we illustrate the im-
pulsive evolution phase of the dimming during the ﬁrst hour of
its development. The color coding refers to the time when each
pixel was detected as a dimming pixel for the ﬁrst time.

To analyze the two-step dimming evolution in more detail,
we divided the dimming region into the eastern and western parts
of the AR (separated at x = 50(cid:48)(cid:48)), and tracked the instantaneous
dimming area and brightness inside the detected dimming re-
gions separately for both regions (see Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b). In
Fig. 7c, we show the time derivative of the dimming brightness.
For comparison with the ﬂare evolution, we show the GOES 1–
8 Å SXR ﬂux and the 0.5–4 Å ﬂux time derivative in Fig. 7d.
It is clearly seen that the evolution of the dimming area and its
brightness evolve diﬀerently in the western and eastern part of
the AR. We see ﬁrst a fast increase of the dimming area and
darkening in the western part, during 03:10 to 03:16 UT, simul-
taneous with the impulsive phase of the ﬁrst ﬂare peak in GOES
soft X-rays. During this time, the eastern part is also developing

but shows a much more gradual evolution. This is followed by an
impulsive increase of the eastern dimming from 03:32 to 03:38
UT, in phase with the second peak of the derivative of the GOES
ﬂare emission. Therefore, the dimming analysis clearly points to
two eruptions. However, we note that we cannot uniquely dis-
tinguish core from secondary dimmings in all of the observed
dimmings. Thus, from the dimming analysis alone it is not pos-
sible to unambiguously conclude whether there are two subse-
quent eruptions of two diﬀerent parts of the same structure, or
two eruptions of two separate structures.

2.4. Associated EUV waves

Two consecutive EUV waves were observed in close succes-
sion associated with the double-peak C1.3 ﬂare under study.
Fig. 8 and the accompanying movie give an overview of the EUV
wave evolution in SDO/AIA 193 Å high-cadence (24 s) running-
diﬀerence images (created with a lag of 288 seconds). The ﬁrst
wave can be clearly identiﬁed after 03:10 UT and shows a quasi-
symmetric circular propagation away from the eruptive center
(top panels). At 03:12:16 UT (panel a), we already see the promi-
nent formation of the EUV wave in the North-West (NW) direc-

tion, while it is not yet so distinct toward the South-East (SE).
However, at 03:17:04 UT (panel b) the EUV wave is clearly seen
in both the NW and SE directions. At 03:21:52 UT (panel c), the
EUV wave is still visible in the SW direction, while there is no
longer a clear wave front discernible in the NW direction. The
second EUV wave can be clearly detected for the ﬁrst time at
03:33:04 UT, i.e. around 20 minutes after the initiation of the
ﬁrst EUV wave. As can be seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 8
(d–f), in contrast to the ﬁrst one the second EUV wave exhibits
an asymmetric character and expands predominantly toward the
Eastern direction. The propagation of the two consecutive EUV
waves is observed for about 40 minutes.

We study the EUV wave propagation in two selected sec-
tors where the wave(s) show strong signals: (i) in the South-
East (SE) sector, where both EUV waves are well observed, and
(ii) in the North-West (NW) sector, in which only the ﬁrst wave
is observed. Both sectors have an angular width of 15 degrees.
To calculate the kinematics of the EUV waves, we derive in-
tensity perturbation proﬁles from base diﬀerence images using
the ring-analysis method (Podladchikova & Berghmans 2005;
Podladchikova et al. 2019; Jebaraj et al. 2020). We ﬁrst build
a spherical polar coordinate system centered at the source AR
12732, and then divide the solar sphere into rings of equal width
(8900 km) around the eruptive center. In the next step, we derive
the perturbation proﬁles by calculating the integral intensity of
all pixels belonging to each ring in the sector under investiga-
tion. The outer border of every ring element is then related to
the corresponding distance from the eruptive center. As a result,
we derive the projections of the radial intensity proﬁles onto the
surface along the line of sight of SDO.

Fig. 9 and the accompanying movie show the derived inten-
sity perturbation proﬁles, smoothed with a forward-backward
exponential smoothing algorithm (Brown 1963), illustrating the
evolution and propagation of the EUV waves in the NW and SE
directions. The y-axis shows the obtained integral intensity, and
the x-axis gives the distance in Mm from the eruptive center.
Panels (a) and (b) show the evolution of the ﬁrst EUV wave in
the NW and SE sectors, while panel (c) shows the evolution of
the second wave in the SE sector. The EUV wave perturbation
proﬁles are characterized by a sharp increase of the intensity to-
wards its peak followed by a decay to the background level. Big
circles (red – ﬁrst wave; black – second wave) mark the peak
amplitude of each proﬁle, whereas small circles (orange – ﬁrst
wave; gray – second wave) mark the determined wave front po-
sitions (extracted at 30% of the proﬁle’s peak value) used for the
derivation of the EUV wave kinematics. The high cadence of the
SDO/AIA imagery allows us to continuously follow the dynam-
ics of the EUV wave. In the movie, which shows the dynamics of
the intensity perturbation proﬁles with a cadence of 24 seconds,
we can clearly see that the ﬁrst wave propagates much faster in
the NW (Fig. 9a) than in the SE sector (Fig. 9b).

To derive the kinematics of the EUV waves, we extract the
positions of the leading wavefronts determined by the 30% level
of the peak amplitude of the perturbation proﬁles (indicated by
small circles in Fig. 9). The resulting kinematics is shown in
Fig. 10c. Panels (a) and (b) show the stack plots derived from
the SDO/AIA 193 Å running diﬀerence images and the results
of ring analysis for the EUV wave propagation on NW (a) and
SE (b) sector. Panel (c) shows the distance-time proﬁles of the
leading fronts of the ﬁrst EUV wave in the NW (red) and SE
(black) sectors, as well as the second EUV wave in the SE sector
(black). Dots denote data points, and the dashed lines are the cor-
responding linear ﬁt. The blue curve in panel (c) shows the time

derivative of the GOES 0.5–4 Å soft X-ray ﬂux of the associated
ﬂare.

For the ﬁrst EUV wave in the NW sector, the linear ﬁts gives
a mean speed of 530 km/s. This is more than twice the mean
speed derived for the SE sector (230 km/s). The mean speed of
the second EUV wave in the SE sector is 240 km/s, which is
comparable with the speed of the ﬁrst wave in the same sec-
tor. As can be seen in Fig. 10c, the initiation of the EUV waves
occurs roughly simultaneously with the peaks of the time deriva-
tives of the GOES SXR emission of the double-peak ﬂare (blue),
indicative of the maxima in the ﬂare energy release process (Ne-
upert 1968; Dennis & Zarro 1993; Veronig et al. 2002). We also
note the spatio-temporal relation of the initiation of the two EUV
waves with the two eruptions (ejected loop systems) associated
with the two energy release episodes of the ﬂare, indicated by
white arrows in the bottom panels of Fig. 2: The ﬁrst (globally)
propagating EUV wave is initiated by the ﬁrst eruption at the
western side of the AR, whereas the second EUV wave (propa-
gating only into the eastern direction) is initiated by the second
eruption at the East of the AR.

2.5. Radio signatures and energetic particles

The two peaks of the GOES ﬂare co-temporal with the two EUV
waves are also associated with two radio events. The dynamic
radio spectrum (colour coded time-frequency diagram) observed
by the Learmonth Radio Spectrograph shows two radio events
observed in close succession (see Fig. 10d). Both radio events
were simple, consisting of only one type of radio emission.

The ﬁrst radio event which occurred co-temporally with the
ﬁrst peak of the ﬂare was a faint, but clearly visible type II ra-
dio burst indicative of a coronal shock wave (e.g. Wild 1950;
Nelson & Melrose 1985; Vršnak & Cliver 2008; Mann 2006;
Magdaleni´c et al. 2010; Mann et al. 2018). Starting at about
03:13 UT, and at approximately 75 MHz, slowly drifting emis-
sion lanes of the type II burst are observed in the dynamic spec-
trum. Type II bursts are considered to be signatures of shock-
accelerated electrons generating Langmuir waves at the funda-
mental electron plasma frequency and/or its harmonics. In this
event, the patchy and broken type II band is most probably the
fundamental emission. We note the absence of type III radio
bursts, i.e. radio signatures of fast electron beams propagating
along open or quasi-open ﬁeld lines, which are usually observed
before the type II burst and frequently associated with the impul-
sive phase of the ﬂare (e.g. Magdaleni´c et al. 2014a, 2020). The

absence of the type III bursts indicates that the event appeared in
a region of the corona with mostly closed magnetic ﬁeld lines.

At about 03:27 UT type III bursts are observed by the
Wind/WAVES instrument (Bougeret et al. 1995), indicating
opening of the ﬁeld lines higher in the corona. This second
radio event lasted until about 03:40 UT and consists of only
two groups of type III radio bursts. These radio bursts coincide
with the second peak of the GOES ﬂare, and they indicate that
the conﬁguration of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld has somewhat
changed after the passage of the ﬁrst EUV wave. The changed
topology of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld provided the possibil-
ity for the fast electron beams to propagate along open or large
quasi-open ﬁeld lines and generate observed type III bursts.

Despite the type III signature of the outward propagating
electrons, no electrons or protons have been observed near Earth
by the GOES satellite. This is not surprising as the ﬂare/CME
eruption is close to the solar disk center while the footpoint of the
interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld of Earth is located towards the west
limb of the Sun away from the eruptive AR. In fact, STEREO-
A has a better magnetic connection to the AR given its helio-
spheric location. In situ STEREO-A IMPACT data4 (not shown
here) show an impulsive but small enhancement of 35–65 keV
electrons starting shortly before 04:00UT on 2019 March 8, i.e. ,
about half an hour after the initiation of the second EUV wave
and the type III bursts. This time delay is in agreement with the

2.6. CME in the upper corona and interplanetary space

The associated CME is analysed in white light observations
from the SOHO/LASCO (Brueckner et al. 1995) C2 and C3
coronagraphs, with a ﬁeld-of-view reaching 6 R(cid:12) and 32 R(cid:12),
respectively, and STEREO-A(ST-A)/SECCHI (Howard et al.
2008) COR1/COR2/HI1 image data with a ﬁeld-of-view reach-
ing 2.5 R(cid:12), 15 R(cid:12), and 90 R(cid:12), respectively. Following the two

eruptions observed at the west limb in EUVI (see Fig. 3), a CME
is observed moving into the COR1 and COR2 ﬁeld of view
(FOV), where it is ﬁrst detected at 03:20 UT and 04:24 UT, re-
spectively. The COR1 and COR2 observations seem to show a
single CME. Quickly after appearing in COR2, the leading edge
of the CME loses coherence in the radial direction (the latitudi-
nal extent remains relatively well deﬁned) and this feature of a
“diﬀuse” leading edge in the radial direction continues in HI1,
making it impossible to track the CME leading edge in HI1 via,
e.g., J-plots. Nevertheless, HI1 observations indicate a slightly
northward direction of the CME. An overview of the CME ob-
servations in COR1, COR2 and HI1 is given in Fig. 11.

From the Earth perspective, and including the ﬂare described
in Sect. 2.1, a CME appears in the C2 FOV at 04:17 UT at a
position angle of 300◦. Quickly after, what appears to be an-
other CME is detected at 04:38 UT at a position angle of 90◦.
These are listed as two diﬀerent CMEs in the LASCO CME cat-
alog5 and marked in the lower left panel of Fig. 12 by green and
blue arrows, respectively. Both features are quite faint in C2 and
are no longer reliably traceable in C3 observations. The plane-
of-sky linear speeds reported in the LASCO CME catalog for
the two features are quite similar, 239 and 294 km s−1, respec-
tively. This indicates that the two structures may correspond to
the same CME (especially given the slightly westward location
of the source position). Second possibility is that they are two
CMEs which already merged and propagate as a single entity.

Further, we perform a 3D reconstruction using the Gradu-
ated cylindrical shell (GCS) model by Thernisien et al. (2006)
and STEREO-A COR2 and LASCO C2 images. In GCS model
CME is represented by a “hollow croissant” geometry, which is

5 https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/

Article number, page 12 of 20

ﬁtted manually to COR2 and C2 images to best represent the
leading edge of the observed CME. The GCS reconstruction is
determined by heliocentric longitude (lon), heliocentric latitude
(lat), the height corresponding to the apex of the croissant (h),
the tilt of the croissant axis to the solar equatorial plane (tilt),
the croissant half-angle measured between the apex and the cen-
tral axis of its leg (half-angle), and the sine of the angle deﬁn-
ing the “thickness” of the croissant leg (aspect ratio). We ﬁrst
perform GCS ﬁtting under the assumption of a single structure
(middle panels of Fig. 12), constraining the ﬁt with the location
of the AR 12734 as the source region (N09W13). The parame-
ters of this reconstruction are: lon=5◦, lat=6◦, h=8 R(cid:12), tilt=5◦,
half-angle=27◦, and aspect ratio=0.3. As can be seen in the mid-
dle panels of Fig. 12, this GCS reconstruction indicates that the
two bright structures observed in LASCO C2 at position an-
gles of 90◦ and 300◦ probably correspond to the same CME. We
next perform GCS ﬁtting under the assumption of two structures
(right panels of Fig. 12), again constraining the ﬁts with the lo-
cation of the AR 12734 as their source region. The parameters of
the ﬁt corresponding to the structure at a position angle of 300◦
(green mesh in the right panels of Fig. 12) are: lon=15◦, lat=6◦,
h=7 R(cid:12), tilt=10◦, half-angle=27◦, and ratio=0.27. The parame-
ters of the ﬁt corresponding to the structure at a position angle
of 90◦ (blue mesh in the right panels of Fig. 12) are: lon=−3◦,
lat=4◦, h=7 R(cid:12), tilt=3◦, half-angle=27◦, and ratio=0.2. As can
be seen in the right panels of Fig. 12, this GCS reconstruction in-
dicates that the two bright structures observed in LASCO C2 at
position angles of 90◦ and 300◦ might correspond to two diﬀer-
ent structures. However, the overlap indicates that two structures
have already merged. Therefore, both reconstructions indicate a
single entity evolving further out, regardless of what occurred in
the lower corona.

Fig. 12. The GCS reconstruction of the CME using STEREO-A COR2 and LASCO C2 observations. The blue and green arrows point towards
two CMEs listed in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog (i.e. two observed features). The green mesh in the middle panels corresponds to the ﬁrst
GCS reconstruction, assuming a single structure. The blue and green mesh in the right panels correspond to the second reconstruction, assuming
two structures. For further details see main text.

Based on the GCS parameters of the ﬁrst reconstruction we
determine the edge-on and face-on widths of the croissant (see
Thernisien 2011) to be ωmin = 17.5◦ and ωmax = 44.5◦, respec-
tively. The corresponding width of the CME in the equatorial
plane, estimated taking into account the tilt, using the relation
described by Dumbovi´c et al. (2019) is ω = 38◦, i.e. very sim-
ilar to the face-on croissant width, as would be expected from
the low tilt. Based on the CME longitudinal extent (ω = 38◦)
and direction of the CME apex (lon=5◦), we would expect to ob-
serve CME signatures near-Earth. However, due to the slightly
northward direction of the CME (lat=6◦) and the fact that it is
a relatively “slim” croissant (ωmin = 17.5◦), we might expect
that only the south part of the CME grazes over the Earth. We
calculate the radius of the croissant at the apex using equations
provided by Thernisien (2011) and obtain a radius of 1.85 R(cid:12)
at a distance of 8 R(cid:12). The linear speed of the CME apex deter-
mined based on the reconstruction at three diﬀerent time-steps
and assuming self-similar expansion is v0 = 350 km s−1. This
means, the CME is quite slow, and therefore not likely to pile-up
a signiﬁcant sheath or drive an interplanetary shock (see e.g., Žic
et al. 2008).

SIDC reports the ICME arrival at 05:44 UT, identiﬁed as a speed
jump from about 360 to 400 km s−1and the abrupt change of the
magnetic ﬁeld orientation, while CCMC reports ICME arrival at
02:00 UT with unspeciﬁed ICME signatures. We note that on

vard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics database (CfA IP

To investigate the arrival of the interplanetary counterpart of
the CME (ICME), we check in situ measurements of the solar
wind plasma and magnetic ﬁeld parameters, respectively. Fig. 13

pha Monitor (SWEPAM; McComas et al. 1998) and Magne-

NASA Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF10). We supplement
these with the time-series of the Disturbance storm time (Dst)

nent of the geomagnetic ﬁeld and is provided by the World Data

frequent than coronagraphic CME observations (Janvier et al.
2014b) and thus debated about whether they are of solar or solar
wind origin (i.e. formed around the heliospheric current sheet,
HCS, Feng et al. 2008; Cartwright & Moldwin 2010; Tian et al.
2010; Janvier et al. 2014c; Murphy et al. 2020). We note that
around the observed SFR there are no typical signatures of the
HCS crossing, such as the reversal of the Bx and By GSE com-
ponents and change in the pitch angle of the suprathermal strahl
electrons (not shown here) accompanied by an increased density
of the heliospheric plasma sheet (Blanco et al. 2006; Sanchez-
Diaz et al. 2019). Moreover, we check Leif Svalgaard’s list of
the sector boundary crossings12, which reports sector boundary
crossings on 2019-02-27 and 2019-03-18, i.e. nowhere near the
observed SFR. Therefore, the observed SFR is likely of solar ori-
gin and corresponds to the eruptions associated with solar event

nT up to ≈ 1.6 nT, i.e. we only observe a partial rotation. Never-
theless, it is observed that Bz rotates south-to-north, while the By
component is negative, indicating counterclockwise rotation in
the Bz-By plane, typical for a right-handed SWN type of ﬂux
rope (Bothmer & Schwenn 1998; Palmerio et al. 2018). This
is in agreement with the positive helicity as determined from
the NLFFF modeling of the source AR. The size of the SFR,
determined based on its duration and estimated mean plasma
speed within the structure of 380 km s−1is ≈ 0.03 AU (6.6
R(cid:12)). Comparing this to the size of the structure reconstructed
using GCS and assuming that the GCS-reconstructed structure
expanded self-similarly following a power-law behaviour (Both-
mer & Schwenn 1998; Démoulin & Dasso 2009), we obtain an
expansion power-law index of na = 0.18, which is very low even
for SFRs (that typically have na ≈ 0.4, see Cartwright & Mold-
win 2010; Janvier et al. 2014c). Therefore, assuming that the ob-
served SFR corresponds to the analysed solar event, it seems that
its expansion was severely hampered. Moreover, the plasma tem-
perature and density in and around the SFR seem to be increased
compared to the ambient solar wind plasma, and the plasma beta
ahead of the SFR is also notably increased. These characteristics
indicate strong interactions of the SFR with the ambient plasma.
It can be seen in Fig. 13 that the plasma speed increase starts
before the SFR at ≈ DOY 71.05 and the plasma density even ear-
lier, around DOY 71.0. These are followed by a sharp increase
of temperature and plasma beta at DOY 71.1 (marked by the ver-
tical solid line in Fig. 13). The increased values of plasma den-
sity, temperature, speed and plasma beta persist until the frontal
border of the SFR, and are accompanied by ﬂuctuating compo-
nents of the magnetic ﬁeld, but the total magnetic ﬁeld is not
increased (on the contrary, it even shows signs of local depres-
sions). Therefore, the region in front of the SFR does not have
typical sheath/pile-up signatures, possibly also related to strong
interactions of the SFR with the ambient plasma ahead.

The last panel in Fig. 13 shows the Dst index, which is a mea-
sure of the geomagnetic response. A clear drop in the Dst index
can be observed corresponding to the south oriented Bz compo-
nent of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld, as would be expected
in geomagnetic storms. However, with a minimum value of −24
nT, the corresponding Dst index is below the −30 nT threshold
to be considered even a minor storm (e.g. Gonzalez et al. 1994).
Finally, we note that based on the observed partial rotation
of the SFR, a slightly northward direction of the eruptions and
GCS-estimated spatial extent it is possible that the structure only
grazed over the spacecraft with its south part. Namely, the posi-

As can be seen in Fig. 13, the in situ measurements around
2019 March 12 (doy 71) are not conclusive of a typical shock-
sheath-magnetic cloud ICME arrival. There is an indication of a
ﬂux rope structure seen as the rotation in the Bz component of the
magnetic ﬁeld starting at DOY 71.26 and lasting until DOY 71.4
and accompanied by the slightly increased total magnetic ﬁeld
(highlighted red in Fig. 13). However, other typical signatures of
a magnetic cloud such as low temperature and low plasma beta
(e.g. Zurbuchen & Richardson 2006; Kilpua et al. 2017a) are
lacking. Given the short duration of this structure (≈ 3.5 hours),
such signatures are indicative of a small ﬂux rope (SFR, see e.g.
Moldwin et al. 2000; Janvier et al. 2014b; Hu et al. 2018; Mur-
phy et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020, and references therein). Such
magnetic structures in the observed solar wind data are far more

tion of the ACE satellite on 2019 March 12 was −7.3◦ with re-
spect to the solar equator. Therefore, the latitudinal separation of
the CME apex as obtained from the GCS reconstruction to the
ACE position is 13.3◦, i.e. only 4.2◦ smaller than the edge-on
width of the croissant.

In order to get a better insight into the state of the heliosphere
during the time of the event under study, we perform a simula-
tion using the European Heliospheric Forecasting Information
Asset (EUHFORIA, Pomoell & Poedts 2018). EUHFORIA is
a 3D MHD model consisting of two parts, the coronal (extend-
ing up to 0.1 AU) and the heliospheric part. The coronal part of
EUHFORIA uses magnetograms as an input to model the solar
corona and to provide the inner boundary conditions for the he-
liospheric part of the model. We employed the GONG Air Force
Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport Model (ADAPT)
magnetograms as an input and the default EUHFORIA coro-
nal setup (Hinterreiter et al. 2019; Samara et al. 2021). In this
setup the initial MHD solar wind parameters at the inner he-
liospheric boundary are provided by the semi-empirical Wang-
Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model (Arge et al. 2003), in combination
with the potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS) model (Altschuler
& Newkirk 1969) and the Schatten current sheet (SCS) model
(Schatten et al. 1969). The 3D presentation of the heliospheric
current sheet (HCS) and a range of fast solar wind velocities
between 580 - 648 km/s as modeled by EUHFORIA, is shown
in Fig. 14. The relative positions of STEREO-A, STEREO-B
spacecraft and Earth are also included. In addition, we show a
corresponding magnetic ﬁeld polarity map, indicating the posi-
tions of AR12734 and Earth relative to the HCS. Fig. 14 shows a
very ﬂat HCS passing above Earth, i.e. Earth is on the opposite
side of the HCS compared to the AR. As discussed in the next
section, such conﬁguration can have multiple consequences for
CME evolution as well as particle propagation.

3. Discussion of the results and interpretation of

the event

Both strong and weak ﬂares are related to restructuring of the
coronal magnetic ﬁeld and the sudden release of previously
stored free magnetic energy. However, for weak ﬂares this re-
structuring is usually not so clearly observed. For ARs with ma-
jor ﬂare activity (GOES class M1.0 and larger), it is generally
hard to detect changes of the coronal (magnetic ﬁeld) evolu-
tion in response to C-class ﬂaring. This is because the magnetic
ﬁeld in major ﬂare-productive ARs is generally very complex
(Hale classes γ–δ) and extended (total area covered by sunspots
(cid:38)200 MSH) (see Table 1 and Fig. 4 of Toriumi et al. 2017, re-
spectively). Then, small ﬂares (GOES class C and smaller) often
aﬀect only a minor portion of the coronal volume of the host
AR and, e.g., ﬂare-associated changes are nearly indistinguish-
able with respect to the total (by orders of magnitude larger)
magnetic energy and helicity budgets. In the present case, how-
ever, we deal with a small AR of moderate magnetic complexity
(Hale class β, total area covered by sunspots ≈20 MSH). This al-
lowed us to unambiguously identify the coronal volume involved
in the ﬂare-related processes and to quantify the corresponding
changes in time proﬁles of the coronal magnetic energy and rel-
ative helicity, deduced from NLFF modeling. Furthermore, its
(magnetically) isolated position on the solar disk also allowed
us to study a manifold of accompanying eruptive features (EUV
waves, coronal dimmings, CMEs, radio bursts, etc.) in great de-
tail.

A ﬂare-related eruption of a pre-existing ﬂux rope may ap-
pear in diﬀerent ﬂavors (for a review see Liu 2020). It may erupt

as a whole, or only partly (for observation-based studies see,
e.g., Sun et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2015, respectively), and even
diﬀerent portions of a ﬂux rope may be ejected during subse-
quent eruptions (for observation-based studies see, e.g., Cheng
et al. 2013; Temmer et al. 2017). Destabilization of a certain
portion of the AR can modify the overlying ﬁeld and change
the stability of neighbouring magnetic conﬁgurations, thus al-
lowing for subsequent eruptions. Indeed, such a scenario has
been shown in MHD simulations to account for magnetically
coupled sympathetic eruptions (Török et al. 2011). We interpret
the observations of the International Womens Day event by such
sympathetic-eruption scenario. First, the two-step nature of the
ﬂare energy release proﬁle is evidenced by the SXR ﬂux deriva-
tive and the AR-integrated UV emission (Fig. 1), as well as the
subsequent loop eruptions observed in SDO/AIA EUV imagery
(Fig. 2 and accompanying movie) on the East and West side of
the AR and the related two-step coronal dimmings. Second, the
fact that the individually involved portions of the coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld were commonly located underneath a single large-

A&A proofs: manuscript no. Dumbovic_et_al_2021

scale (envelope) ﬁeld (Fig. 4a,b), supports the idea that the sta-
bilizing eﬀect of the overlying ﬁeld changed in the course of the
two-step ﬂare process. The recent stability analysis of Joshi et al.
(2021) suggests that the conﬁnement of the overlying magnetic
ﬁeld prior to the ﬂare onset was weakest above the western part
of the AR, i.e. , cospatial to the apparent location of the ﬁrst erup-
tion, prone to torus instability. We assume that the changes to the
conﬁning ﬁeld due to the ﬁrst eruption gave way to subsequent
setting in of torus instability in the eastern part of the AR, i.e. ,
at the location where the second eruption occurred.

In the present case, we argue that it is the low-corona mag-
netic ﬁeld (which bridges a possibly existing low-lying magnetic
ﬂux rope) along the main polarity inversion line (PIL) which
got successively removed in the two-step ﬂare process, rather
than the low-lying ﬂux rope itself. This is supported by the Hα
observations which show that the PIL-aligned ﬁlament is still
present after the two-step eruption (see Sect. 2.1). This interpre-
tation contrasts that of, e.g., Joshi et al. (2021), of a zipping-like
asymmetric eruption of a single underlying ﬂux rope, also be-
cause such a single pre-existing ﬂux rope is not identiﬁable from
our NLFF models, and the corresponding reconstructed 3D CME
geometry is inconclusive in that respect, as discussed at the end
of this section.

The two-step ﬂare process had severe impacts on the coro-
nal relative magnetic helicity budget. In particular, the positive,
non-potential (current-carrying) helicity dropped to nearly zero
in the course of the ﬂare, supporting the ejection of highly non-
potential magnetic structures of positive handedness (Fig. 5d).
Simultaneously, the free magnetic energy dropped by a factor
of ∼two (Fig. 5c), i.e. , about 8 × 1029 erg were available to be
released. This value is in good agreement with the energy typ-
ically released during C1-class ﬂares (about 6 × 1029 erg; e.g.,
Kretzschmar (2011) and Fig. 13 of Tschernitz et al. (2018)).

In association with the two-step ﬂare process, also two EUV
waves were observed that occurred in close succession. They
were initiated close in time to the two peaks of the GOES SXR
ﬂux derivative of the C1.3 ﬂare and two distinct loop eruptions
observed low in the corona in SDO/AIA EUV ﬁltergrams. While
the ﬁrst wave propagated globally in all directions, as has been
observed before in solar minimum events (e.g., Thompson et al.
1998; Veronig et al. 2008; Kienreich et al. 2009; Podladchikova
et al. 2019), the second one was limited to the East side of the
source AR.

The global propagation of the ﬁrst EUV wave can be ex-
plained by the asymmetric eruption on both the East and West
side of the AR, with the major part (ejected loop system) into
the West and a weaker, narrow part to the East. This asymmetry
in the eruption may also explain the very diﬀerent EUV wave
speeds observed for diﬀerent propagation directions of the ﬁrst
wave (530 km/s in the NW sector; 240 km/s in the SE sector),
similar to the asymmetric event studied in Temmer et al. (2011).
Many studies have demonstrated that EUV waves are large-
amplitude, sometimes even shocked, fast magnetosonic waves
propagating through the corona (e.g., Mann et al. 1999; Warmuth
et al. 2001; Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2009; Veronig et al. 2010,
2018; Long et al. 2017). In this scenario, a stronger driver (erup-
tion) initiates a fast-mode MHD wave with a larger amplitude,
and due to the non-linear evolution of the large-amplitude per-
turbation, a higher amplitude is related to a higher phase speed
(Mann 1995; Luli´c et al. 2013; Warmuth 2015; Vršnak et al.
2016).

The second EUV wave was initiated by the ejected loop sys-
tem at the East edge of the AR and was able to propagate freely
in this direction, whereas toward West its propagation was im-

peded by the high Alfvén speeds in the core of the AR. Finally,
we note that the ﬁrst EUV wave was associated with a type II ra-
dio burst, indicative of shock formation somewhat higher in the
solar corona (e.g., Mann et al. 1999; Vršnak & Cliver 2008; War-
muth 2015), whereas the second event was associated with type
III bursts indicative of only accelerated electrons having access
to“open” ﬁeld lines, and no associated shock wave.

Although the low coronal signatures clearly indicate two dis-
tinct eruptions, white light observations do not unambiguously
indicate two separate CMEs. While the SOHO/LASCO view
does reveal two segments (in East and West), STEREO-A white
light observations do not give any indication of two separate
CMEs. A 3D reconstruction using single CME geometry indi-
cates that the two segments observed in LASCO C2 may be
ﬂanks of the same CME, whereas a 3D reconstruction using two
separate CME geometries indicates their merging. Therefore, we
believe that the white light observations point to a single entity,
most likely composed of two merged structures. We note that
the white light signatures are quite weak, especially in the ra-
dial direction around the CME apex as observed by STEREO-
A (the leading edge quickly dissolves). The observed structures
were launched from a centrally located AR and accompanied by
a shock (type II radio burst). Thus, the question arises, why are
the white-light signatures so weak, even when viewed with an
almost perfect quadrature perspective from STEREO-A? During
solar minimum phases, the HCS is known to reside at the low-
latitude streamer belt, exhibiting almost no warps (e.g., Smith
2001). This is exactly the case in our study, as revealed from
modeling results by EUHFORIA. The AR under study was lo-
cated just slightly above the HCS, which is quite ﬂat. The merged
structure shows low tilt with respect to the solar equator and con-
sequently to the HCS. The conﬁguration of the large-scale mag-
netic ﬁeld, as given by the HCS, would thus have little relevance
for the lateral expansion into EW direction. On the other hand
we might expect that its lateral expansion in the NS direction
would be aﬀected by the HCS, especially in its south part. Given
the weak white-light signatures in the radial direction around the
CME apex, it is likely that most of the driving force went into lat-
eral EW expansion, and not radial expansion. The observed type
II burst is most likely generated by the shock wave driven with
the expanding CME ﬂanks (see e.g. Magdaleni´c et al. 2014b;
Zucca et al. 2018). This is also in agreement with the fact that
the interplanetary shock was not observed in situ . The location
of the HCS in addition explains the lack of SEPs detected at
Earth, as the HCS can serve as a discontinuity boundary making
it diﬃcult for charged particles to propagate across. The situation
is diﬀerent for STEREO-A which seems to be situated above the
HCS, namely, on the same side of the HCS as the source region
of the eruptions under study. This may have favored particles to
arrive and be detected at STEREO-A as addressed in Sect. 2.5.
In the in situ signatures a small ﬂux rope (SFR) is observed,
most likely associated with the studied solar event with indica-
tions of strong interactions with the ambient solar wind plasma
and hampered expansion. These can also be related to the fact
that the AR and Earth are located at diﬀerent sides of the HCS.
Being located south of the structure, the HCS is likely to ham-
per its expansion in the south direction and strongly interact and
erode its south part. We note that this event falls into a category
of so-called opposite side events which are also usually related
to lower geo-eﬀectiveness (see e.g., Henning et al. 1985; Zhao
et al. 2007). In addition, as only a partial rotation is observed, it is
possible that only one portion of the structure was crossed by the
spacecraft, which was already indicated by the simple geometry
analysis of the GCS-reconstructed structure’s size compared to

M. Dumbovi´c et al.: The 2019 International Women’s Day event

the relative positions of the AR and spacecraft. Moreover, par-
tial crossing of the spacecraft through the structure, as well as
possible erosion are in agreement with its small detected size, as
well as the lack of two distinct inner magnetic structures. Finally,
the low geomagnetic impact is a direct consequence of the struc-
ture’s size and magnetic ﬁeld strength. Although the SFR has
south-oriented magnetic ﬁeld, its strength and duration are too
small to produce signiﬁcant geomagnetic eﬀect (e.g. Gonzalez
et al. 1994).

4. Summary and Conclusion

We present a detailed analysis of an eruptive event that oc-
curred early on 2019 March 8 in active region AR 12734 (SOL-
2019-03-08T03:07C1.3), to which we refer as the International
Women’s Day event. The event originated from a small AR
of moderate magnetic complexity and is characterized by very
pronounced eruptive low-coronal signatures, including a small
double-peaked C1.3 ﬂare, coronal dimmings, two EUV waves,
type II and III bursts, low particle radiation hazard at Earth and
two loop ejections evolving into an Earth-directed CME with
weak in situ signatures and negligible Earth-impact.

The two-step nature of the ﬂare energy release proﬁle, as
well as the subsequent loop eruptions observed in EUV imagery
and the related two-step coronal dimmings indicate two erup-
tions. These observational ﬁndings are supported by the results
of the NLFF modelling, showing that there are individually in-
volved portions of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld over-arched by a
single large-scale ﬁeld. The eruption in the west part of the AR
would thus disturb the stability of the east part of the AR, caus-
ing the second, sympathetic eruption. However, we ﬁnd that it
is the low-corona magnetic ﬁeld, bridging a possibly existing
low-lying ﬂux rope along the polarity inversion line, which got
removed in the two-step ﬂare process, and not the low-lying ﬂux
rope (evidenced by an Hα ﬁlament) itself.

The observation of two EUV waves provides further support
for the two-eruption interpretation. The ﬁrst, globally propagat-
ing EUV wave is initiated at the time of the ﬁrst eruption at the
western side of the AR, whereas the second EUV wave (prop-
agating only into the eastern direction) is associated with the
eruption at the eastern side of the AR. The ﬁrst EUV wave was
associated with a type II radio burst, indicative of shock forma-
tion somewhat higher up in the solar corona, whereas the second
event was associated with type III bursts indicative of acceler-
ated electrons moving along newly opened ﬁeld lines. This is
supported by electrons observed within half an hour after the
second event at STEREO-A, which had a good magnetic con-
nection to the AR that allowed eﬃcient transport of energetic
particles.

Coronagraphic observations do not unambiguously indicate
two separate CMEs, but rather a single entity most likely com-
posed of two sheared and twisted structures that correspond to
the two eruptions observed in the low corona. We ﬁnd that the
conﬁguration of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld favors the lateral
expansion into East-West direction, over the expansion in the
North-South direction or radial expansion. Moreover, we ﬁnd
that the CME is propagating on the opposite side of the HCS
compared to Earth. The HCS therefore poses an obstacle for both
energetic particles and plasma structures, and as such it is very
important for interpretation of the in situ observations. SEPs are
not observed at Earth, which may be due to lack of magnetic con-
nectivity. The interplanetary signatures of the solar eruptions are
that of a small ﬂux rope with increased density and temperature,
most probably related to the strong interaction with the ambient

plasma (as would be expected for a structure crossing the HCS).
The corresponding geomagnetic impact is practically negligible,
as observed in previous cases of opposite side events. The anal-
ysis of this peculiar event therefore reveals that the large-scale
magnetic ﬁeld can have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on both the early
and the interplanetary evolution of the solar eruption.

description and validation

In order to study the coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of
AR 12734 in space and time, we use data products from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (Schou et al. 2012, HMI)
and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (Lemen et al. 2012,
AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (Pesnell et al.
2012, SDO). We use HMI continuum images images with a
cadence of 45 seconds to study the AR’s photospheric evolu-
tion and, in addition, use AIA images with a time cadence of
24 seconds to investigate the corresponding dynamics at chro-
mospheric/transition region and coronal temperatures. In order
to study the three-dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic ﬁeld, we
use hmi.sharp_cea_720s data which provides the Cylindrical
Equal Area (CEA) projected photospheric magnetic ﬁeld vec-
tor within automatically-identiﬁed active region patches (Bobra
et al. 2014) with the azimuthal component of the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld being disambiguated (Metcalf 1994; Leka et al. 2009).
We use the full-resolution CEA data (pixel scale ≈ 360 km at
disk center) binned by a factor of two, as an input to a nonlin-
ear force-free (NLFF) method. We use data with the native 12-
minute time cadence around the C1.3 ﬂare (between March 08
02:12 UT and 04:12 UT), and use a 1-hour cadence maps cov-
ering an extended time period (between March 07 21:12 UT and
March 08 09:12 UT). AR 12734 was located close to disk center
(N09E01 – N09W04) during the entire considered time interval
(March 21:30 UT – 08 March 08:30 UT) so that projection ef-
fects can be assumed negligible.

In order to perform the NLFF modeling, we apply the
method of Wiegelmann et al. (2012), i.e. , we combine the im-
proved optimization scheme of Wiegelmann & Inhester (2010)
and a multi-scale approach (Wiegelmann 2008). In our work,
we apply a three-level multi-scale approach to the preprocessed
vector magnetic ﬁeld data. The latter is achieved by applying
the preprocessing method of Wiegelmann et al. (2006) to the
original vector magnetic ﬁeld data. We adopted a computational
domain of 168 × 96 × 184 pixel3, with the photospheric mag-
netic ﬂux on the NLFF model lower boundary (at z = 0) be-
ing balanced to within ∼ 5%. We employ two diﬀerent free
parameter choices for both, the preprocessing and optmization
steps, as suggested in Thalmann et al. (2020). More precisely,
we once run the preprocessing using the standard settings as
suggested in Wiegelmann et al. (2012) and once without ex-
plicit smoothing. Hereafter, we subsequently perform the 3D
NLFF reconstruction based on the two time series of prepro-
cessed maps twofold. Once using the equal weightings for the
volume-integrated Lorentz force and divergence term (for de-
tails see Wiegelmann et al. 2012), and one using an enhanced
weighting of the volume-integrated divergence to achieve a more
solenoidal (divergence-free) solution. Consequently, we obtain
four time series of NLFF models, being force- and divergence-
free to a diﬀerent level (which is crucial to be checked for subse-
quent magnetic helicity analysis; see last paragraph of this Sec-
tion).

For each of the individual NLFF solution, a potential (ref-
erence) ﬁeld is computed, suﬃcing B0 = ∇φ, with φ being
the scalar potential, subject to the constraint ∇nφ = Bn on
∂V, where n denotes the normal component with respect to the
boundaries of V. For each of the individual NLFF solutions, a
potential (reference) ﬁeld is computed, suﬃcing B0 = ∇φ, with
φ being the scalar potential, subject to the constraint ∇nφ = Bn
on ∂V, where n denotes the normal component with respect to
the boundaries of V.

Based on these boundary requirements, and the additional
constraint that the NLFF and potential ﬁeld are solenoidal (i.e. ,
∇ · B = 0 and ∇ · B0 = 0), we are able to compute the gauge-
invariant relative helicity (HV; Berger & Field 1984; Finn & An-
tonsen 1985), known to represent a meaningful quantity to com-
pute and track the time evolution of a magnetic system within
a ﬁnite model volume (Valori et al. 2012). In addition, we com-
pute the separately gauge-invariant contribution of the current-
carrying ﬁeld (HJ; Berger 2003) in order to gain additional in-
formation on the time evolution of the respective non-potential
ﬁeld, BJ = B − B0.

In order to be able to compute the helicities introduced
above, one needs to obtain the vector potentials A and A0, which
suﬃce ∇ × A = B and ∇ × A0 = B0, respectively. Therefore,
we use the ﬁnite-volume (FV) method of Thalmann et al. (2011)
to solve the systems of partial diﬀerential equations to obtain A
and A0, using the Coulomb gauge, ∇ · A = ∇ · A0 = 0. The
method has been tested in the framework of an extended proof-
of-concept study on FV helicity computation methods (Valori
et al. 2016), where it has been shown that for various test se-
tups the methods deliver helicity values in line with each other,
diﬀering by only small percentage points. It has also been used
in Thalmann et al. (2019) to show that the computed helicity
is highly dependent on the level to which the underlying NLFF
magnetic ﬁeld satisﬁes the divergence-free condition.

Successful NLFF modeling, and subsequent helicity compu-
tation, requires some numerical conditions to be met. First, the
NLFF models are expected to deliver a 3D corona-like model
magnetic ﬁeld with a vanishing Lorentz force and divergence. In
order to quantify the force-free consistency we use the current-
weighted angle between the modeled magnetic ﬁeld and elec-
tric current density (Schrijver et al. 2006). In order to quan-
tify the divergence-free consistency of our NLFF solutions we
compute the fractional ﬂux metric as introduced by Wheatland
et al. (2000). Alternatively, the non-solenoidal fraction of the to-
tal magnetic energy, Ediv/E, where Ediv denotes the energy con-
tribution due to a non-vanishing divergence, has been found to
represent a relevant criterion (as ﬁrst introduced by Valori et al.
2013). In the proof-of-concept study by Valori et al. (2016),
based on solar-like numerical experiments, it was suggested that
only Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.08 is suﬃcient for a reliable helicity computa-
tion. In a follow-up study, Thalmann et al. (2019) suggested an
even lower threshold (Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.05) for solar applications.

Only two of the four employed NLFF model time series suf-
ﬁce the criterion Ediv/E ≤ 0.08 noted above. More precisely, the
two time series based on an enhanced weighting of the volume-
integrated divergence show a suﬃciently low level of Ediv/E dur-
ing the considered time interval, and are used for further analy-
sis. Having two NLFF model time series of suﬃcient solenoidal
quality at hand (represented by ﬁlled and empty symbols in
Fig. A1c, allows us to compute a mean value as well as to in-
dicate a related uncertainty range (black line and gray-shaded
area, respectively). For our two NLFF model time series we ﬁnd
a mean value of Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.06. The corresponding mean val-
ues describing the force-free and divergence-free consistency are
θ j (cid:46) 15◦ and < | fi| >(cid:46) 3 × 10−4, respectively (see Fig. A1a and
Fig. A1b, respectively). Having two NLFF model time series of
model quality at hand, we are able to compute a mean value of
the investigated quantities (magnetic energy (E), free magnetic
energy (EF), relative helicity (HV), and non-potential helicity,
HJ) as well as to indicate a related uncertainty.
