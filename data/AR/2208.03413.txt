Abstract 

Half-Heusler alloy topological semimetal YPtBi is a promising candidate for an efficient spin source 

material having both large spin Hall angle θSH and high thermal stability. However, high-quality YPtBi 

thin films with low bulk carrier density are usually grown at 600oC, which exceeds the limitation of 

400oC for back end of line (BEOL) process. Here, we investigate the crystallinity and spin Hall effect 

of YPtBi thin films grown at lower growth temperature down to 300oC. Although θSH degraded with 

lowering the growth temperature to 300oC due to degradation of the crystallinity, it was recovered by 

reducing the sputtering Ar gas pressure. We achieved a giant θSH up to 8.2 and demonstrated efficient 

spin-orbit torque magnetization switching by ultralow current density of ~105 A/cm2 in YPtBi grown 

at 300°C with the Ar gas pressure of 1 Pa. Our results provide the recipe to achieve giant θSH in YPtBi 

grown at lower growth temperature suitable for BEOL process.

Introduction 

Spin orbit torque (SOT) generated by the spin Hall effect in a non-magnetic layer can be used 

for manipulating the magnetization of an adjacent magnetic layer,1  which is promising for spintronic 

devices such as magnetoresistive random access memory,1,2  spin torque oscillator,3,4  and racetrack 

memory.5  Numerous  studies on  efficient spin source materials have been conducted with focus on 

improving the charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, or spin Hall angle θSH.6,7,8,9,10,11,12  Early works 

show that heavy metals (HMs) with strong spin orbit interaction have moderately large θSH of 0.08-0.3 

and good compatibility with back end of line (BEOL) processes,6,7,8 and thus, the first-generation SOT 

devices  have  been  developed  with  HMs. 13 , 14   Recently,  chalcogenide-based  topological  insulators 

(TIs) have been shown to have very large θSH (>1) thanks to their large Berry phase originated from 

the  Dirac-like  dispersion  of  their  topological  surface  states  (TSSs).9,10,11,12  However,  utilizing  the 

chalcogenide based TIs in realistic SOT devices is still challenging due to their pour compatibility with 

BEOL  processes  such  as  low  thermal  stability  and  high  toxicity,  because  they  consist  of  mostly V   

group  (Bi,Sb)  and  VI  group  (Se,Te)  elements. 15 ,16   Therefore,  the  second-generation  SOT  devices 

based on chalcogenide-based TIs have not  yet been adopted by the industry despite their attracting 

feature of large θSH.17 

Recently,  we  have  demonstrated  large  θSH  in  YPtBi, 18   which  is  a  half-Heulser  alloy 

topological semimetals with no toxic element.  19,20,21  We have shown that YPtBi has not only large 

effective spin Hall angle 

  up to 4.1 but also high thermal stability of 600oC, which is favorable

for BEOL process. In YPtBi, suppression of bulk carrier or bulk conductivity is a key to achieve large 

.18,22  Since YPtBi is basically a zero-gap topological insulator, the bulk carriers are generated by

crystal  defects.  Therefore,  previous  reports  adopted  high  growth  temperature  of  600oC  during 

sputtering to improve the crystal quality.18,22 However, such a high growth temperature exceeds the 

limitation  of  400oC  of  BEOL  process.  For  fabrication  of  realistic  SOT  devices  on  top  of  silicon 

electronics during BEOL process, it is essential to reduce the growth temperature to below 400oC. 

In this work, we investigate the crystallinity and spin Hall effect of YPtBi grown at lower 

temperature  down  to  300°C.  We  found  that 

   and  the  effective  spin  Hall  conductivity 

   of 

YPtBi decrease with lowering the growth temperature from

Effect of growth temperature on the crystallinity and spin Hall effect of YPtBi 

First, we investigated how the growth temperature (TG) affects the crystallinity and spin Hall 

effect of YPtBi. We prepared 30 nm-thick YPtBi films grown at TG = 300, 400, 500 and 600oC by co-

4 

 
 
 
sputtering Y, Pt, and Bi targets. The Ar gas pressure during YPtBi sputtering was fixed to 2.0 Pa, and 

the atomic Y/Pt composition ratio was fixed to the exact stoichiometry of 1.0 to minimize the bulk 

carriers.22 The sample structure was Ta (1.0) / MgAl2O4 (5.0) / YPtBi (30) / c-Sapphire (the number 

are the layer thicknesses in nm). Here, we assumed that the 1 nm-thick Ta layer on MgAl2O4 was fully 

oxidized after exposure to the air. Figure 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra for the YPtBi 

samples grown at various temperature. Peaks from YPtBi(111) orientations were clearly observed in 

all samples. Peaks from residual Bi (filled triangles) were also observed at TG below 400oC, when the 

Bi  de-absorption  rate  from  the YPtBi  films  is  lower.  Figure  1(b)  shows  the  TG  dependence  of  the 

integrated peak intensity of YPtBi(111) with the powder ring correction.23  Although the integrated 

peak intensity is nearly unchanged at TG ≥ 400oC, it dropped at TG = 300oC indicating degradation of 

the crystallinity. Figure 1(c) shows the TG dependence of the hole carrier density (p) and mobility (µ) 

measured by using the Van der Pauw method at room temperature. p and µ are nearly unchanged at TG 

≥ 400oC and comparable to those reported in another sputtered Bi-based half Heusler alloy.24  However, 

p increased  to 1021 cm-3 while µ dropped to 7 cm2/Vs at TG = 300oC, reflecting degradation  of the 

crystallinity. Therefore, weaker spin Hall effect is expected for the sample grown at 300oC due to its 

poor crystallinity. 

We then investigate the relationship between the growth temperature and the spin Hall effect. 

For this purpose, we fabricated heterostructure samples consisting of Ta (1.0) / MgAl2O4 (1.0) / Pt 

(0.8) / Co (0.8) / Pt (0.8) / YPtBi (10) / c-Sapphire, where the YPtBi layer was grown at 300, 400, 500 

5 

 
and 600oC, and the Pt/Co/Pt layers were grown at room temperature. Below, we will refer Pt (0.8) / Co 

(0.8) / Pt (0.8) as CoPt (2.4) for short. Here, the parasitic spin Hall effect from the two Pt layers is 

negligible because the thickness of the Pt layers is few times thinner than the spin diffusion length of 

Pt  and  the  layer  structure  of  CoPt  is  symmetric. 25 , 26 , 27 , 28   After  deposition,  these  samples  were 

patterned into 10×60 μm2 Hall bar devices with Pt / Ta electrodes for transport measurements. Figure 

2(a) – (d) show the anomalous Hall resistance  RAHE  of the Hall bar devices measured with an external 

magnetic  field  Hext  applied  along  the  z-direction  (film  normal).  Although  all  samples  show 

perpendicular magnetic  anisotropy (PMA), the squareness ratio of the hysteresis of  RAHE  becomes 

less  than  1  at  300oC.  These  results  suggest  that  the  quality  of  CoPt  on YPtBi  also  degrades  with 

decreasing TG. Next, we used the high-field second harmonic Hall effect measurement technique with 

an alternating current at 259.68 Hz for evaluation of 

. In the high-field second harmonic Hall effect 

method, the second harmonic Hall resistance  Rxy

Effect of sputtering Ar gas pressure on the crystallinity and spin Hall effect of YPtBi

Next, we investigated the effect of sputtering Ar pressure (PAr) on the crystallinity and spin 

Hall effect of the sample grown at 300oC. Improvement of the bulk crystallinity of YPtBi is expected 

for  lowering  PAr  during  YPtBi  deposition,  because  lower  PAr  provides  higher  kinetic  energy  of 

sputtered Y/Pt/Bi atoms and recoil Ar atoms, leading to higher migration energy for the atoms that 

arrive on the film surface.31  Figure 4(a) shows the PAr dependence of the XRD spectra for 30 nm-

thick stand-alone YPtBi samples grown at 300oC. We found that YPtBi(111) orientation is maintained 

at lower PAr. Figure 4(b) shows the PAr dependence of the integrated peak intensity of YPtBi(111). The 

intensity was improved by reducing PAr, indicating improvement of the crystallinity. Figure 4(c) shows 

the PAr dependence of p and µ in 30 nm-thick stand-alone YPtBi thin films measured by using the Van 

der Pauw method at room temperature. p monotonically decreases while µ monotonically increases 

with lowering PAr, indicating  improvement  of  their  crystallinity, which is  consistent with  the XRD 

results. 

Next,  we  investigated  the  spin  Hall  effect  of  YPtBi  grown  at  300°C  with  various  PAr  in 

heterostructures of Ta (1.0) / MgAl2O4 (1.0) / Pt (0.8) / Co (0.8) / Pt (0.8) / YPtBi (10) / c-Sapphire.   

Figure 5(a) – (d) show RAHE of 10×60 μm2 Hall bar devices of those samples measured with Hext applied 

along  the  z-direction.  We  found  that  the  squareness  ratio  of  the  RAHE  hysteresis  was  recovered  by 

reducing PAr. Figure 6(a) – (d) show the surface morphology for these samples measured by atomic 

force  microscopy.  We  observed  that  the  grain  size  becomes  larger  as  expected  from  the  higher 

migration energy of atoms arrived on the surface of YPtBi at low PAr, consistent of the improved bulk 

8 

 
crystal quality shown in Fig. 4 and the enhanced hysteresis of RAHE in Fig. 5. Figure 7(a) shows the 

representative high-field second harmonic Hall resistance data for the sample grown at PAr = 1.0 Pa 

with low conductivity σYPtBi of 0.14×105 Ω-1m-1, and the corresponding fitting using Eq. (1) at bias 

currents of 1.8 to 3.4 mA (0.4 mA step), where the dots and solid curves are the experimental data and 

fitting curves, respectively. Figure 7(b) shows the relationship between the extracted values of HDL and 

JYPtBi for this sample. From this slope, we obtained a giant 

  of 8.2 thanks to suppression of bulk 

shunting current in this sample. This value is larger than 

𝜃𝜃

eff

  of many  conventional chalcogenide-

based TIs,9,10,11 and comparable to that of sputtered BiSb topological insulator.32  Figure 7(c) shows

the PAr dependence  of 

. Although 

  does  not  increase monotonously with  lowering PAr, we 

achieved large 

  of 1.5 at PAr = 0.7 Pa and 4.2 at PAr = 0.5 Pa. Figure 7(d) shows the PAr dependence

with PAr = 2.0 Pa (denoted by the dashed line). 

Finally,  we  demonstrated  SOT  magnetization  switching  by  ultralow  current  density  in  the 

sample  with  giant 

   of  8.2.  Figure  8(a)  shows  direct  current  (DC)-induced  SOT  magnetization 

switching  with  Hext  (-0.55  ~  0.55  kOe)  applied  along  the  x-direction.  The  switching  polarity  was

inverted when the direction of Hext was reversed, consistent with the feature of SOT switching. Here, 

the switching polarity was same as Pt.18,33  Figure 8(b) shows the threshold current density  Jth

YPtBi  as 

a  function  of  Hext.  Low  Jth

YPtBi  on  the  order  of  105 Acm-2  was  achieved  for  entire  Hext.  Figure  8(c) 

shows the pulse current-induced SOT switching with Hext of 0.18 kOe applied along the x-direction, 

9 

 
where the pulse width τ was set to 50 µs ~ 10 ms. Figure 8(d) shows  Jth

YPtBi  as a function of τ. The 

switching  current  density  in  YPtBi  is  two  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  that  in  Pt  with  CoPt 

ferromagnetic layer at 100 ms pulse current.34  We then fit  Jth

YPtBi   =  7.3×105  A/cm2.  Finally,  we 

demonstrate repeating SOT switching by pulse currents of JYPtBi = 6.8×105 A/cm2 and τ = 50 μs. Figure

9(a)  shows  the  sequence  of  total  105  pulse  currents.  Figure  9(b)  shows  the  Hall  resistance  data 

measured with Hext = 0.18 kOe applied along the x-direction. We observed very robust switching by 

YPtBi. These results indicate that the YPtBi film grown at 300oC and low PAr has SOT performance 

not inferior to that of the sample grown at 600oC. 

Conclusion 

We  have  investigated  the  crystallinity  and  spin  Hall  effect  of YPtBi  films  grown  at  lower 

temperature. When  we  reduced  the  growth  temperature  from  600oC  to  300oC,  both 

   and

decrease due to degradation of crystallinity of YPtBi and spin transparency at the interface between

reduced the Ar gas pressure to increase the migration energy of atoms arrived on the surface of YPtBi.
