Summary

In this chapter we analyze the multiple ionization by impact of |Z| = 1 projec-
tiles: electrons, positrons, protons and antiprotons. Diﬀerences and similarities
among the cross sections by these four projectiles allows us to have an insight
on the physics involved. Mass and charge eﬀects, energy thresholds, and rela-
tive importance of collisional and post-collisional processes are discussed. For
this purpose, we performed a detailed theoretical-experimental comparison for
single up to quintuple ionization of Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe by particles and an-
tiparticles. We include an extensive compilation of the available data for the
sixteen collisional systems, and the theoretical cross sections by means of the
continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state approximation. We underline
here that post-collisional ionization is decisive to describe multiple ionization
by light projectiles, covering almost the whole energy range, from threshold to
high energies. The normalization of positron and antiproton measurements to
electron impact ones, the lack of data in certain cases, and the future prospects
are presented and discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction

1

Multiple ionization is a challenging subject, which plays an important role
in the knowledge of many-electron processes, such as multiple-electron transi-
tions, collisional and post-collisional ionization or electron correlation eﬀects.
The goal of this contribution is to deepen in the study of the multielectronic
processes by collision of |Z| = 1 particles and antiparticles. For this purpose
we focused in the multiple ionization of the heaviest rare gases, Ne, Ar, Kr
and Xe. We analyzed the diﬀerences and similarities in the cross sections of
equal-charge versus equal-mass projectiles. The ionization cross sections by
light (electrons and positrons) and heavy (protons and antiprotons) projec-
tiles are quite diﬀerent in the low and intermediate energy regions. On the
contrary, in the high energy region all these cross sections converge. However,
this convergence to proton impact values is diﬀerent for antiprotons, positrons
or electrons. A detailed knowledge of this tendency from intermediate to high
impact energies is important because of the experimental normalization of rel-
ative cross sections of antiparticles to electron or to proton values. Classical
reviews on particle and antiparticle collisions can be found in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

The theoretical description of the multiple ionization processes by these
projectiles must consider the charge and mass eﬀects, the projectile trajecto-
ries, and the energy thresholds. The post-collisional ionization (PCI) due to
Auger-type processes following inner-shell ionization, enhance the ﬁnal num-
ber of emitted electrons. For heavy projectiles this is important at high en-
ergies. For light projectiles, such as electrons and positrons, PCI dominates
the highly-charged ion production in the whole energy range, even close to
the energy threshold. The ionization by proton and electron impact has been
studied since the early years of the development of atomic physics. However,
the experimental data on multiple ionization by high energy protons could not
be theoretically described until the last ﬁfteen years [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; and by
electron impact only recently [13]. This was possible by a consistent inclusion
of the branching ration for PCI within the independent electron model.

Multiple ionization is also a sensitive test for the experimental work. Mea-
surements require highly advanced techniques to get all possible channels and
ﬁnal states. For protons, they must separate pure ionization from capture
In
channels, which enhance the data in the intermediate energy region [6].
the case of positron impact, the total ionization values at low energies include
positronium formation [7]. On the other hand, the higher the order of ioniza-
tion the smaller the cross sections. The quintuple ionization cross sections of
Kr and Xr are of the order of the 10−19 cm2 at high energies, while for Ar they
are 10−20 cm2 or even 10−21 cm2.

The published experimental data of multiple ionization of Ne, Ar, Kr and

2

LIST OF FIGURES

Xe by proton impact is profuse [6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Much
more abundant are the measurements by electron impact. They include the
pioneering works by Schram and co-workers in the 60s [21] to the present
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].

Instead, the experimental data by antiparticle is more scarce, what is rea-
sonable. Antiprotons are produced in high-energy physics sources and then
decelerated for atomic collisions experiments. This research has been devel-
oped by Knudsen and coworkers at CERN [16, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37], ﬁrst in
the low energy antiproton ring (LEAR) and nowadays in the antiproton de-
celerator (AD). A very recent state of art of antiproton impact ionization
has been published by Kirchner and Knudsen [38]. In the case of positrons,
most of the experimental publications report only values of single ionization
[39, 40, 41, 42, 43], some articles include double or triple ionization measure-
ments [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51], and only one paper quadruple ionization
[49]. It is worth to mention that antiproton and positron values are normalized
to electron impact ionization cross sections at high energies.

In this chapter we present a comparison of the multiple ionization cross
sections by impact of electrons, positrons, protons and antiprotons. We con-
sider the rare gases Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, and ﬁnal charge states from +1 to +3
(Ne), and +5 (Ar, Kr and Xe). The comparison includes the theoretical results
obtained by employing the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state ap-
proximation in [12, 13, 52, 53], and the available experimental measurements.
The extensive compilation of data for the four projectiles and the four targets
included here, allow us to have a wide vision of the experimental state of art,
and some future prospects.

0.2 Theoretical description

The theoretical description of the multiple ionization reviewed in this chapter
relies on three approximations:

1. The independent particle model (IPM): the ejected electrons ignore
each other, neglecting the correlation in the ﬁnal state and the changes
in the target potential due to the successive loss of electrons. Under this
assumption, the probability of multiple ionization can be expressed as a
multinomial combination of independent ionization probabilities.

2. The continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW-EIS)
approximation [54, 55]. This is a proved model to describe intermediate
and high energy multiple ionization by protons and antiprotons [12, 52].
In [13, 53], the CDW-EIS is adapted to describe ionization by electrons

0.2. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION

or positrons, by taking into account the ﬁnite momentum transferred,
the non-linear trajectory and the mass eﬀect. Light particle ionization
is characterized by the sharp energy thresholds, which are diﬀerent for
single to quintuple ionization. The results in [53] include the diﬀerent
thresholds of energy within the multinomial expansion following [56].

3. The post-collisional ionization (PCI), independent of the pro-
jectile. Thus, it is included within the multinomial expression in a semi
empirical way following [8, 10], using the experimental branching ratios
of the charge-state distribution after a single initial vacancy. Present
formalism is explained in [12]. A detailed compilation of these branching
ratios is available in [13].

In what follows the implications of these approximations on the calcula-
tions are summarized. More details of them can be found in the mentioned
references.

0.2.1 The independent particle model for multiple ion-

ization

Within the IPM, the probability of direct ionization of exactly qj electrons of
the j subshell as a function of the impact parameter b, P(qj)(b), is obtained as
a multinomial distribution of the ionization probabilities pj(b) given by

P(qj)(b) =

Nj
qj (cid:19)

(cid:18)

[pj(b)]qj [1 − pj(b)]Nj −qj ,

(1)

where Nj is the total number of electrons in the subshell. If n electrons are
j qj, then the total probability of direct
ionized from the diﬀerent shells, n =
ionization is

P

P(n)(b) =

Xq1+q2+...=n Yj

P(qj )(b).

(2)

and the cross section corresponding to the direct ionization of exactly n elec-
trons is

σn =

Z

P(n)(b) 2π b db.

(3)

The main and more sensitive values of these calculations are the ionization
probabilities as function of the impact parameter, pj(b). Diﬀerent models
have been employed in the last ﬁfteen years to obtain these pj(b) for multiple
ionization calculations, by the groups of Montenegro [8, 9, 12, 57, 58, 59, 60],
Kirchner [10, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65], Rivarola [11, 66, 67], and Miraglia [12, 13, 52,
53, 68, 69].

0.2.2 CDW-EIS ionization probabilities by proton, an-

tiproton, electron and positron impact

We review here the results for proton, antiproton, electron and positron impact
multiple ionization in [12, 13, 52, 53]. These results employ the CDW-EIS code
by Miraglia [54]. Details of these calculations are in [52, 54]. The aim is to
discuss the scope and limitations of this model to deal with particle-antiparticle
and heavy-light projectile eﬀects.

The CDW-EIS ionization probabilities pj(b) as function of the impact pa-
rameters are the seeds to be introduced in the multinomial expression given by
(1). As expected, these results tend to the ﬁrst Born approximation ones at
suﬃciently high impact energies [52]. In fact, the extension of the theoretical
results for impact velocities v > 8 a.u. in [12, 13, 52, 53] is achieved using the
ﬁrst Born approximation.

On the other hand, the CDW-EIS results for light projectiles in [13, 53]
were obtained by adapting the CDW-EIS model for equal-charged light pro-
jectiles, i.e. protons → positrons; antiprotons → electrons. This calculation
accounted for the ﬁnite momentum transferred, the non-linear trajectory (very
diﬀerent for positrons and electrons due to the repulsive or attractive poten-
tials), and the minimum energy for ionization. A detailed explanation and the
corresponding equations can be found in [13].

The CDW-EIS results in [12, 13, 52, 53] describe pure ionization of the
target. No electron transfer or transfer followed by projectile electron loss is
included. These processes are possible only for positive projectiles, and may
enlarge the experimental cross sections at low energies.

Ionization processes present a sharp energy threshold:

ionization is not
possible for projectile energies below the binding energy of the target outer
electrons. The threshold for each shell of electrons must be taken into account
within the multinomial expression (1). One of the diﬀerences between light
and heavy projectiles is that, on equal impact velocity, light projectiles have
impact energies of the order of the target binding energies or even lower. This
is the main cause of diﬀerences between ionization cross sections by light and
heavy projectiles at intermediate to low energies.

Experimentally the threshold or appearance energy is well known and mea-
sured in electron and positron-impact ionization. For n-fold ionization the ex-
periments indicate that this appearance energy is much greater than n times
the binding energy of the outermost electrons. This was analyzed in [56] con-
sidering not only the energy gap, but also the mean velocity of the outgoing
electrons in a semi-classical way. This proposal was included in the multiple
ionization calculations by electron and positron impact in [53]. Although the
threshold itself is rather well described, the theoretical model cannot be em-

0.3. RESULTS AND DATA

ployed close to the energy threshold. The CDW-EIS approximation fails at
low impact energies, i.e. when the energy loss by the projectile is comparable
to the impact energy. We will return to this later in this chapter.

0.2.3 Auger type postcollisional ionization

The PCI is the rearrangement of the target atom after inner-shell ionization.
Diﬀerent processes (shake oﬀ, Auger decay and emission) are involved in the
emission of one or more electrons long after the collision. Following Cavalcanti
et al [8] and Spranger and Kirchner [10], the PCI is included inside the binomial
equation (1) in a semi-empirical way by using experimental branching ratios
of charge state distribution after single photoionization. The deeper the initial
hole, the greater the number of electrons in PCI.

The branching ratios Fj,k are the probabilities of loosing k electrons in
PCI after single ionization of the j subshell. They correspond to time delayed
processes that only depend on the target. A detailed compilation of the exper-
imental branching ratios Fj,k for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe available in the literature
is tabulated in [13]. It is interesting to note that they verify the unitary con-
kmax
k=0 Fj,k = 1. In [12] the branching ratios are introduced in (1) as
dition,

Afterwards, the addition of probabilities is arranged in order to put together
those terms that contribute to the same ﬁnal number of emitted electrons.
New probabilities of exactly n emitted electrons are obtained, including di-
rect ionization and PCI, P P CI
(see section 2.3 in [12] for details). Thus, the
corresponding cross sections of n-fold ionization including PCI are

0.3 Results and data of particle and antipar-

ticle ionization: charge and mass eﬀects

What follows is a revision of the theoretical CDW-EIS results for multiple ion-
ization of Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe by protons and antiprotons [52], electrons [13],
and positrons [53]. This is achieved by comparing and analyzing the cross sec-
tions for the four |Z| = 1 projectiles together, and contrasting them with the
experimental data available in the literature. The comparison is performed on

6

equal impact velocities, and is plotted as a function of the corresponding elec-
tron impact energy. The change to proton impact energies is straightforward,
just an mp/me factor (the ratio of masses of heavy and light projectiles).

In the following sections the results for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe are pesented.
We will note that the threshold for light particles is quite well described by
the theory. However, we will focus on the description of the intermediate to
high impact energy processes that is the range of validity of the CDW-EIS.

In ﬁgures 1-3 we plotted together the CDW-EIS results for proton, antiproton,
electron, and positron impact ionization [52, 13, 53], for ﬁnal Ne+ to Ne+3. We
do not pretend to extend the validity of the IPM for Ne (ten bound electrons)
beyond the triple ionization [60]. Changes in the target potential may be
signiﬁcant in this case. On the contrary, for targets with larger number of
bound electrons, the IPM is expected to work.

Ne single ionization

In ﬁgure 1 we include the theoretical curves and the experimental measure-
ments for the single ionization cross sections of Ne by protons (p+), antipro-
tons (p-), electrons (e-), and positrons (e+). It can be observed that the main
diﬀerence between heavy and light projectiles are the lower values at inter-
mediate and low energies, and the sharp threshold around 23 eV. Instead, all
the results converge at high energies. The intermediate energy region is the
most interesting one. We note that for equal mass, the values for projectiles
with charge Z = −1 are below the Z = +1 ones. It could be said that the
ionization of Ne is more eﬀective by positive charges.

The theoretical description is rather good for the heavy projectiles. In the
case of protons, below the maximum the agreement is ﬁne only with the data
by DuBois [6] who separates pure ionization and capture. This may be the
diﬀerence between DuBois [6] data and the recent Sarkadi et al [20] experi-
mental values at intermediate to low energies. In the case of antiprotons we
remark the good agreement with Andersen measurements at high energies [16].
Instead, the data by Paludan [35] are somewhat below the predictions, but the
tendency is correct. For single-ionization by light particles, the theoretical val-
ues overestimate around the maximum, and describe nicely the measurements
at high energies.

The normalization of antiparticle cross sections is a point of discussion [53].
The experimental cross sections by positrons and antiprotons are mostly rela-
tive values normalized to well known and tested high energy electron impact

data, such as Rapp et al [70], Sorokin et al [71], or Krishnakumar et al [24].
For example, the positron data by Kara et al [45] and antiproton data by
Paludan et al [35] are both normalized to electron impact data by Krishnaku-
mar et al [24] at 800-1000 eV. The comparison displayed in ﬁgure 1 shows
that for the theoretical model, antiprotons and positrons tend faster to proton
values than to electron ones at high energies. At 400 eV proton, antiproton
and positron curves are together and 10% above electron impact values. Even
around 1000 eV the electron single ionization is still a little below the rest.
This implies that antiproton and positron relative values could be normalized
to total proton-impact ionization cross sections, such as those by Rudd et al
[72], at no so high energies.

Ne double ionization

In ﬁgure 2 we display the double ionization of Ne. We use the logarithmic
scale to emphasize the fall down and convergence at high energies, which is
much more drastic than for single-ionization.

The double ionization cross sections by antiprotons at intermediate to low
velocities, i.e. v < 2.3 a.u. are higher than by proton impact. Inverse to single
ionization. And this reversal can be seen in the data and in the theoretical de-
scription too. Another point to remark in ﬁgure 2 is that theoretically, above
200 eV (electron impact) the proton, antiproton and even positron curves con-
verge to a single value. Instead, for electron impact the convergence is above
600 eV. Experimentally, the positron data are below the electron measure-
ments. It is not clear how much it inﬂuences the normalization of the single
ionization measurements of positrons to electron-impact data at the level of

the double ionization.

At high energies, the description is actually good. Our values include the
post-collisional Auger and shake oﬀ processes. At 3 keV the PCI contribution
is 60% of the total double ionization (see ﬁgure 2 in [53]). At intermediate
energies, the theoretical curves clearly overestimate the electron and positron-
impact data. This is related to the inclusion of PCI due to shake-oﬀ of the
outer shell electrons of Ne, as explained in [13]. This is an interesting open
topic: The inclusion of PCI allows us to describe the high energy region, but
it produced too high values at intermediate energies. On the contrary, if only
direct double ionization is considered, the maximum for electron impact cross
section and the energy threshold are better described, but the high energy
measurements are undervalued.

Ne triple ionization

The triple ionization cross sections of Ne are displayed in ﬁgure 3. The the-
oretical results for proton and antiproton triple ionization are rather good.
They clearly show that antiprotons produce larger triple ionization for ener-
gies around the maximum than protons. Note that this is exactly the opposite
for single ionization.

The comparison of the cross sections by heavy and light projectiles shows
the expected lower values for light projectiles and the convergence at high
energies. The CDW-EIS results for light projectiles overestimate the measure-
ments near the energy threshold. This is partially due to the overestimation
of the shake-oﬀ contribution, and partially due to being in the limit of validity
of the model, as mentioned previously in this chapter.

It is very interesting to mention that the high energy data could not be
described if the postcollisional contribution to triple ionization (initial ioniza-
tion of inner shells and rearrangements processes) is not included [13]. This
contribution is important above 400 eV, being 90% of the triple ionization
cross sections at 1 keV.

0.3.2 The multiple ionization of Ar

We analyze in this section the Ar multiple ionization, from single to quintuple.
In ﬁgures 4-8 we displayed together the CDW-EIS results for proton, antipro-
ton, electron and positron in Ar [52, 13, 53], and an updated compilation of
experimental data for the four projectiles.

In the following ﬁgures it will be noted that the theoretical description
shows better agreement with the measurements than for Ne. This behavior is
enhanced for heavier targets, as we will observe for Kr and Xe in the following

sections. The IPM works better to describe the multiple ionization in multi-
electronic targets, so that the number of loose electrons is much smaller than
the number of bound electrons.

Ar single ionization

In ﬁgure 4 the single ionization of Ar by the four |Z| = 1 projectiles is displayed.
The good description of the experimental values by the CDW-EIS can be noted.
The proton impact measurements by Andersen et al[16] and by Sarkadi et al
[20] at impact velocities below 2.5 a.u. are clearly higher than the theoretical
values. It may be possible that these single ionization measurements by proton
impact include capture, enhancing the number of measured Ar+. Obviously,
the antiproton measurements are pure ionization, and capture is not possible.

[35].

In the high energy region, the convergence of the proton, antiproton, positron
and electron measurements and also of the theoretical curves, is clearly above
300 eV. Again, our model predicts that the ionization by positrons tends to
antiproton and proton values at lower energies than to the electron impact
values. In the case of Ar, this tendency is also found in the experimental data
by Laricchia and coworkers [42, 40].

Ar double ionization

In ﬁgure 5 the double ionization of Ar is shown. The general description
obtained with the CDW-EIS for the heavy and the light projectiles is good.
Though this model is not capable of describing the low energy processes, the

results are quite good in this region too. The threshold for double ionization
of Ar by electron and positron impact is correctly described, as compared to
the data.

At high energies (E > 1 keV) our curves are below most of the electron-
impact and proton-impact data. It is worth to mention that all the Ar shells
have been included in this calculation, even the K-shell. So this unexplained
undervalue of the theory may be related to the empirical branching ratios
employed.

Ar triple ionization

LIST OF FIGURES

In ﬁgure 6 the triple ionization of Ar is displayed. The experimental data
for heavy projectiles is rather well described, though overestimated around
the maximum. The theory predicts antiproton values above the proton ones
at the maximum of the cross section. Experimentally, the data for protons
match well with the data for antiprotons.

In this ﬁgure we remark the importance of the PCI by including the direct
triple ionization values (dashed double-dotted line) and the triple ionization
including PCI (solid line) for electron impact ionization. As can be noted, PCI
is correctly included. It is interesting to note a double-shoulder shape in the
triple ionization by light projectiles. This is due to the passage from the energy
region of direct ionization (only valence-shell ionization) to the region of higher
energies, where PCI is not negligible (inner shell ionization). Note that this
double shoulder can be observed also in the electron impact measurements.
The theory reproduces the shape but overestimates below 250 eV. It would
be interesting to have measurements of triple ionization by positron impact to
study this eﬀect too.

Ar quadruple ionization

In ﬁgure 7 the quadruple ionization cross sections of Ar are displayed. Again we
emphasize the importance of PCI by including the direct quadruple ionization
for the electron-impact case (dashed double-dotted curve). Above 300 eV the
PCI is crucial, instead the direct ionization falls down, being negligible for
impact energies above 400 eV. The theory predicts a small shoulder around
200 eV related to these two diﬀerent ionization mechanisms. It can also be
noted that the threshold for electron-impact quadruple ionization is nicely
described.

Figure 7 shows that there are no antiparticle data for quadruple ionization
of Ar. This is related to the diﬃculties to measure such low values, i. e. around
or less than 10−18 cm2 for proton impact, around or less than 10−19 cm2 for
electron impact.

Ar quintuple ionization

Finally in ﬁgure 8 the quintuple ionization of Ar is displayed. The only data
available in the literature is for electron-impact quintuple ionization. Nev-
ertheless we include the CDW-EIS results for the four |Z| = 1 projectiles.
Hopefully, these cross sections could be tested with future measurements by
proton, antiproton and positron impact.

The theoretical description is very good considering it is quintuple ioniza-
tion of Ar in an IPM approximation. The prediction of the threshold at 230 eV
is also ﬁne. In this ﬁgure, the cross sections by electron and positron impact
are entirely due the PCI following inner-shell ionization (1s, 2s, and 2p). And
this is valid in the whole energy range, even just above the threshold. The
direct-ionization contribution is so small that it is out of scale in ﬁgure 8, i.e.
less than 2 10−22 cm2.

0.3.3 The multiple ionization of Kr

We present in this section a comparative study of Kr multiple ionization by
the four |Z| = 1 projectiles, covering from single up to quintuple ionization. In
ﬁgures 9-13 we displayed together the CDW-EIS results for proton, antiproton,
electron and positron [52, 13, 53], and the available experimental data.

0.3. RESULTS AND DATA

Kr single ionization

19

In ﬁgure 9 we display the single ionization cross sections of Kr. The theoretical-
experimental agreement is very good. Note that for electron impact the theo-
retical description agrees in the maximum and in the energy threshold. Above
100 eV all the data seem to converge. Similarly to the case of Ar, the data by
Sarkadi et al [20] for proton impact are quite above the CDW-EIS predictions.
But in this case we can also compare with the measurements by DuBois and
coworkers [6, 17]. DuBois experiments separate capture and pure ionization.
The diﬀerences between Sarkadi et al [20] and DuBois data [6, 17] below 60
eV are clear. This seems to conﬁrm the presence of capture in [20].

Kr double ionization

In ﬁgure 10 we can observe and analyze the double ionization of Kr by particle
and antiparticle impact. The good description of Kr double ionization by
antiproton, proton and electron impact is remarkable. The theoretical and
experimental values show clearly that the cross sections for heavy projectiles
are quite similar for impact velocities above 1.7 a.u.

The theoretical results show that the double ionization cross sections by
the light projectiles are much lower than those of the heavy projectiles at
intermediate energies, with the threshold around 40 eV. These values reproduce
the electron impact data rather well. However, the positron data by Kara et
al [45] are below the theoretical predictions and quite below the electron data.
At low impact energies the mass-eﬀect dominates. The cross sections by
light projectiles are below the heavy projectiles ones, with the characteristic
sharp threshold. This contrasts with the charge-eﬀect at high energies. Above
100 eV positron values are closer to proton values than to electron ones. The
high energy convergence of the diﬀerent curves and data is evident at high
energies, as expected.

Kr triple ionization

The theoretical results presented in ﬁgure 11 nicely describe the measurements
of proton, antiproton and electron impact. No measurements for triple ioniza-
tion of Kr by positrons have been reported yet. For light projectiles, PCI is the
main contribution almost in the whole energy range. This is remarked in ﬁgure
11 with a separate curve that shows the direct triple ionization without PCI.
Again, the small hump near the threshold is associated with the appearance of
the PCI contribution. It is present in the theoretical curve for electron impact,
and may be noted in the certain data. The bigger hump for positron impact

could be an artifact of the theoretical calculations. However, no theoretical
experimental comparison is possible for positron impact.

As already mentioned, the mass eﬀect is more important than the charge
eﬀect at low and intermediate energies, while equal charge determines the
energy for which the curves converge. Theoretically, the positron cross sections
tend to proton ones for E > 1 keV. Instead electron impact cross sections
converge to the rest above 2 keV. This may indicate that when the ionization
of inner shells dominates, the mass eﬀect prevails over the charge eﬀect.

Kr quadruple ionization

agreement is noticeable. The comparison is very interesting. The direct ioniza-

tion is a minor contribution for light particles even near the energy threshold.
In the case of heavy particles, PCI is important at rather low energies. This
is remarked in ﬁgure 12 by including the theoretical direct quadruple ioniza-
tion cross section by proton impact. Below 700 eV the theoretical results for
positron impact are close to the electron ones, but no comparison with the
experiments is possible for positron impact. The lack of antiparticle cross sec-
tions is evident in this ﬁgure. We expect that the present study may be of
interest for future measurements.

Kr quintuple ionization

Finally, the quintuple ionization is displayed in ﬁgure 13. The behavior is
similar to the one observed for quadruple ionization. Note that for proton

impact there is only one set of experimental data, by DuBois [6]. The case is
diﬀerent for electron impact measurements, which are by far the most abundant
of the four projectiles studied here. However, we included the theoretical
predictions for the four |Z| = 1 projectiles in view of future measurements.

For electron impact, PCI dominates the quintuple ionization in the whole
energy range. The direct quintuple ionization is negligible even for energies
near the threshold.
It is worth to mention that to describe the quintuple
ionization of Kr, even the ionization of the L-shell must be considered [68].
Moreover, the good performance of the CDW-EIS for the Kr+5 ﬁnal charge
state is due to the correct description of the ionization probabilities of the
very deep shells, both by heavy and light projectiles.

0.3.4 The multiple ionization of Xe

Finally, Xenon multiple ionization by |Z = 1| projectiles is displayed in ﬁgures
14-18, from single to quintuple ionization. The results for multiple ionization
of Xe in these ﬁgures show the scope of the model that combines CDW-EIS,
IPM for multiple ionization, mass eﬀects in the description of light projectiles
and the PCI through the empirical branching ratios. The theoretical results
for Xe show a very good description of the experimental measurements for
the diﬀerent |Z| = 1 projectiles, meaning that the charge eﬀects (positive vs.
negative charges, repulsive or attractive potential) and the mass eﬀects (dif-
ference in the impact energy, threshold, non-linear trajectories) are correctly
included. On the other hand, it is reasonable that the IPM approximation
(no electron-electron correlation, no changes in the target potential due to the
loss of one or more electrons) works better for Xe with 54 electrons than for
Ne, with only 10 electrons. The Xe potential is less aﬀected by the loss of a
few electrons, and the approximation of independent events without changes
is more realistic.

Xe single ionization

In Figure 14 the ionization of just one electron is displayed in linear scale in
order to show in detail the measurements and the theoretical cross sections
around the maximum. The CDW-EIS predicts that proton and antiproton
maximum cross sections are around 40 eV (in electron impact energy, it is
v ∼ 1.7 a.u.), while positron and electron curves are shifted to 55-60 eV. It
is very interesting that the positron and antiproton highest cross sections are
almost equal. The electron impact values are below the positron data around
the maximum. For impact energies 40-80 eV, the single ionization by positron-
impact is more eﬀective (higher probabilities) than by electron-impact.

The very good agreement with the experimental values reinforce these con-
clusions. The measurements for the diﬀerent projectiles converge at high ener-
gies, and show the peculiar behavior for each projectile at lower energies. The
description of the antiproton measurements by Paludan et al [35] is quite good
in the whole energy range. The same for electron and positron impact. Clearly
the positron measurements are above the electron ones, as predicted theoreti-
cally, with values very similar to those of antiproton. The experimental data
for proton impact by Manson et al [18] are well described at high energies, but
the three measurements for impact velocities v < 3 a.u. are clearly above the
theoretical curve. The comparison of them with the single ionization by an-
tiproton, which is actually pure ionization, suggests that electron capture may
be present in this proton impact data. At high energies, the measurements
of single ionization of Xe by proton impact by Cavalcanti et al [9] are below
the rest. It would be useful to compare measurements for Xe+ production by
proton impact at 1 ≤ v ≤ 4 with the similar antiproton values.

Xe double ionization

The agreement between the theoretical and the experimental values in ﬁgure
15 is amazing. These cross sections are not so small, i.e. around 10−15 − 10−16
cm2. The experimental values for double ionization of Xe by antiprotons are
very interesting because they cover the energy range around the maximum of
the cross section. Instead, there is a lack of proton impact data in this energy
region (velocity v < 3 a.u.). For positron impact, there are three groups of
independent data with rather good agreement with the CDW-EIS results. It
may be noted that the low energy measurements by Bluhme et al [48] suggest a
diﬀerent energy threshold for electron and positron impact. This is not shown
by the theory [56, 53] included here. However, it is worth to remember here
that the CDW-EIS is not expected to be valid near the energy threshold. So
we cannot state a conclusion abut this positron-electron diﬀerence.

Above 1 keV all the double ionization cross sections converge. These values
are highly inﬂuenced by the single ionization of a subvalence electron followed
by decay and emission of a second electron. This PCI is important for energies
above 200 eV and represents 80% of the double ionization cross section at 1
keV.

Xe triple ionization

The triple ionization of Xe, theory and compilation of available data, is pre-
sented in ﬁgure 16. The comparison shows again the validity of the description.
The antiproton, proton and electron impact data are in reasonable agreement

with the theoretical curves. For triple ionization, the threshold for light projec-
tile ionization is very sharp and pushes down the cross sections. Theoretically,
the cross sections are similar for electron and positron impact, with the two
humps and a small minimum at 200 eV. At high energies, the positron curve
converges to proton one at 400 eV, while the electron curve does above 1 keV.
This high energy triple ionization is mostly PCI, as indicated in the ﬁgure.
The curve obtained just considering the direct triple ionization (without PCI)
is far from describing the data.

It can be noted in ﬁgure 16 that there are diﬀerences among the three
sets of positron data. The measurements by Kruse et al [51] agree with the
expected values around the maximum. However, the more recent measure-
ments by Moxom et al
[50] are below the curves and
the electron-impact data. Again we can draw attention to the lack of proton
impact measurements at intermediate and low energies.

[49] and Helms et al

Xe quadruple ionization

In the ﬁgure 17 the quadruple ionization of Xe is displayed, including the
experimental data available and the CDW-EIS results for the four |Z| = 1
projectiles. The abundance of electron impact data can be noted, while there
is only one set for positron impact [49], and only one set for proton impact [9].
No antiproton values are available in the literature, and proton data is available
only in the energy region where they converge to electron-impact ones. The
lack of measurements for the heavy projectiles around the maximum of the
cross section does not allow to evaluate the theoretical predictions for proton
and antiprotons. On the other hand, the positron measurements by Moxom
et al [49] are a factor 2 below the theoretical values.

The agreement with the electron impact data below 300 eV is ﬁne con-
sidering they are quadruple-ionization cross sections. On the contrary, the
theoretical high-energy values are too small. Concerning this undervalue, the
CDW-EIS results in [53] include very deep shells, so the branching ratios of
PCI may be the reason. However, it is fair to remark that at 5 keV the direct
quadruple ionization cross sections are 4 orders of magnitude below the exper-
imental values. Thus, the theoretical values including PCI, even a factor two
below the data at 5 keV, are a rather good description of the electron impact
values.

Xe quintuple ionization

Finally, for quintuple ionization of Xe in ﬁgure 18, only electron and proton
impact data are available in the literature. For electron impact, the theoretical
curve is in good agreement with the experimental measurements, considering

the diﬃculties of such low values. The high energy proton measurements by
Cavalcanti et al [9] also agree with the electron data, except with those by
Almeida et al [29] that are larger than the rest. The theoretical curves for
proton and antiproton impact are quite similar around the maximum. But
there is no experimental data to conﬁrm this.

There are some characteristics to remark about the CDW-EIS results for
quintuple ionization displayed in ﬁgure 18: the ﬁrst one is that at low im-
pact energies, the energy threshold for electron and positron impact is nicely
described. The inclusion of the mean energy transferred in the threshold for
multiple ionization proved to be important [56]. For example, while the outer
5s and 5p electrons of Xe have binding energies around 13 eV, the threshold for
quintuple ionization is 178 eV [53], much greater than 5 × 13 eV. The second
point to emphasize is that the Auger-like processes leading to quintuple ioniza-

tion are by far the main contribution for light projectiles in the whole energy
range, even near the threshold. The single ionization of the Xe 4s, 3d, and 3p
electrons are the most important contributions to ﬁnal quintuple ionization.
This is clear in view of the experimental branching ratios for Xe in table 4 of
[13]. At high energies, again the convergence of positron values to proton and
antiproton takes place around 400 eV, while electron impact values do so only
above 6 keV.

0.4 Concluding remarks and future prospects

In this chapter the particle and antiparticle multiple ionization of Ne, Ar, Kr
and Xe was analyzed considering heavy and light projectiles. This was done
based on the CDW-EIS results and a vast compilation of the experimental data
available in the literature for the sixteen collisional systems, four projectiles
and four targets.

The theoretical formalism combines the independent particle model, the
CDW-EIS ionization probabilities for heavy projectiles, the changes in this
approximation to consider light-particle collisions (diﬀerence in the impact en-
ergy, threshold, non-linear trajectories), and the inclusion of the post-collisional
contribution to the ﬁnal charge state due to Auger-like processes.

The multiple ionization of Kr and Xe shows the scope of the model: good
description for the diﬀerent |Z| = 1 projectiles, meaning that the charge and
mass eﬀects are correctly included. The improvement of the theoretical results
with the target nuclear charge (or with the number of bound electrons) is
evident. The employment of the independent particle model to obtain multiple
ionization probabilities does not consider changes in the target potential due
to the loss of one or more electrons. It is reasonable that this approximation
works better for atoms such as Kr or Xe than for Ne.

The correction of the CDW-EIS approximation to describe light particles
shows the tendency of the experimental data. On the other hand, the energy
thresholds calculated separately and imposed within the multinomial expan-
sion, proved to describe rather well the experimental values for electron and
positron impact. Although the threshold itself is rather well described, the
CDW-EIS approximation is not expected to be valid for low energies.

The highly-charged ion production is dominated by the post-collisional elec-
tron emission that follows the inner-shell ionization (rearrangement and/or
Auger processes). The CDW-EIS results are good even for quadruple and
quintuple ionization cross sections. These calculations are sensitive to the
good description of the deep shell ionization. They also rely on the empirical
branching ratios of post-collisional ionization. We concluded that in multi-
ple ionization by light particles, the post-collisional contribution is the main
ionization channel in the whole energy range, even close to the threshold.

Future prospects can be separated in two lines. Within the theoretical
work, the case of Ne is one of the limitations of the model. Not only related
to the independent electron approximation, but also to the inclusion of the
shake-oﬀ. Future progress in this regard is expected. On the other hand, the
CDW-EIS has already been tested for sextuple ionization of Kr and Xe by
electron impact with very good agreement with the experimental data. The
extension to higher ionization orders (ﬁnal charge state +q ≥ 7) requires high

computational eﬀort but is possible.

Within the experimental research, the extensive compilation of data and
the comparison of electron, positron, proton and antiproton values have been
very enlightening. Unfortunately, the thorough particle-antiparticle compar-
ison could be made up to double ionization. This is an interesting point to
consider for future research. There are no positron impact experiments for
higher levels of multiple ionization of rare gases. The exception is Xe. The
antiproton data available goes up to triple ionization. It is interesting to note
that, though the requirements and diﬃculties of the antiproton experiments
(high energy physics facility), there are more measurements for ionization of
Xe by antiprotons than by protons.

Present review also discussed the normalization of antiparticle relative mea-
surements to the high energy electron ionization cross sections. We found that
at high energies, the ionization cross sections by antiparticles impact converge
to proton impact values at lower energies rather than to electron impact ones.
Recent techniques for electron ionization measurements introduce very low rel-
ative errors, and make them quite interesting and reliable for the normalization
purposes. The point to consider is that from which impact energy positron
