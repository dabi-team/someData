CAMASSA-HOLM CUSPONS, SOLITONS AND THEIR
INTERACTIONS VIA THE DRESSING METHOD

ROSSEN IVANOV, TONY LYONS, AND NIGEL ORR

Abstract. A dressing method is applied to a matrix Lax pair for the Camassa-
Holm equation, thereby allowing for the construction of several global solutions
of the system. In particular solutions of system of soliton and cuspon type are
constructed explicitly. The interactions between soliton and cuspon solutions of
the system are investigated. The geometric aspects of the Camassa-Holm equa-
tion ar re-examined in terms of quantities which can be explicitly constructed
via the inverse scattering method.

1. Introduction

This paper aims to explai how the dressing method, well known in the soliton
theory, can be applied to one of the most famous integrable equations of the last
20 years - the Camassa-Holm (or CH) equation. In particular, the method allows
for the explicit construction of the soliton and cuspon solutions and for further
investigation of the interactions between them. The Camassa-Holm equation is
given by

(CH)

qt + 2uxq + uqx = 0
uxx
q = u

u(x, t) = u0, where

u0 > 0 is constant. The CH equation admits both smooth and peaked travelling
wave solutions cf.
[3, 4]. Physically the Camassa-Holm equation has attracted
a great deal of interest as an approximate ﬂuid model for two-dimensional water
waves propagating over a ﬂat bed [3, 4, 24, 22, 23, 36, 37, 38, 17, 28] as well as
in other set-ups [5]. Interpreted as a ﬂuid model, the solutions u(x, t) represent
the ﬂuid particle velocity induced by the passing wave, or alternatively as the
surface elevation associated with the wave. Moreover, the system also constitutes
a model for the propagation of nonlinear waves in cylindrical hyper-elastic rods,
in which the solutions u(x, t) represent the radial stretching of a rod relative to
the undisturbed state, see [19].

For the past number of decades the Camassa-Holm equation has proven to be a
remarkably fertile ﬁeld of mathematical research, with the volume of research pa-
pers dedicated to various aspects of the system most likely measured in thousands,
and as such our bibliography is by no means exhaustive. A particularly striking

feature of the Camassa-Holm equation relates to the existence of peaked solutions
for the system, which are solutions of the form

|

with q0 and p0 being constants. These peaked solutions (or peakons) are weak
solutions whose wave crests appear as peaks, see [3, 4, 18, 43]. In addition the
Camassa-Holm equation also allows for the existence of breaking wave solutions,
which are realised as solutions which remain bounded but whose gradient becomes
unbounded in a ﬁnite time, cf. [3, 4, 9, 10, 7, 53]. The presence of both peaked and
breaking wave solutions for the system (CH) ensures the Camassa-Holm equation
is a highly interesting physical model. To compliment the utility of the system in
modelling a diversity of physical phenomena, the Camassa-Holm equation exhibits
a rich mathematical structure. The equation is a member of a bi-Hamiltonian
hierarchy of equations [25] and it is integrable with a Lax pair representation [3].
A notable property of the system is its formulation as a geodesic ﬂow on the
Bott-Virasoro group [44, 30, 31, 15].

Soliton solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation have been derived by manifold
methods, including but not restricted to Hirota’s method [42, 43, 46, 47, 48], via
the B¨acklund transform method [52, 41], along with the inverse scattering method
[11, 2]. In the current work we develop a modiﬁed version of the inverse scattering
method, namely the dressing method, to construct the cuspon and soliton solu-
tions and cuspon-soliton interactions of the Camassa-Holm system. The dressing
method is an eﬃcient variation of the inverse scattering transform which allows for
a very direct construction of soliton solutions of integrable PDE [54, 55, 45, 26].
The essential procedure behind this dressing method is the construction of a non-
trivial (dressed) eigenfunction of an associated spectral problem from the known
(bare) eigenfunction, by means of the so-called dressing factor. This dressing fac-
tor is analytic in the entire complex plane (of values of the spectral parameter),
except for a collection simple poles at pre-assigned discrete eigenvalues. This bare
spectral problem is obtained for some trivial solution, e.g. u(x, t) = u0, where u0
as indicated above is the asymptotic value of the solution, which we require to
be constant and strictly positive. Since the potential terms of this bare spectral
problem are simply constant, this means the spectral problem is readily solved to
yield the bare eigenfunction. In the following we will outline the construction of
the solutions of the CH equation associated with the discrete spectrum of the Lax
operator, i.e. the solitons and cuspons.

The Camassa-Holm equation has many similarities with the integrable Degasperis-

Procesi (or DP) equation [20, 21]. The inverse scattering transform of the DP
equation is studied in [14, 1], and in particular the dressing method for the DP
equation is presented in [13]. In the following we will reformulate equation (CH) in
the form of a matrix Lax pair, and impose an appropriate gauge transformation on

A DRESSING METHOD FOR THE CAMASSA-HOLM EQUATION

this matrix equation, which reduces the spectral problem to the familiar Zakharov-
Shabat spectral problem. We deduce several important reduction symmetries of
the spectral problem, which are then utilised in constructing the dressing factor.
This in turn allows for the construction of solutions of the dressed spectral prob-
lem, from solutions of the bare spectral problem which are readily solved. Finally,
using these dressed eigenfunctions, we obtain the physical solutions we seek by
solving a straight forward diﬀerential equation.

may be seen to represent the Camassa-Holm equation (cf. equation (CH)), by
φtxx on the spectral function φ and
imposing the compatibility condition φxxt ≡
comparing terms of equal order in λ, [3]. The constant λ appearing in equation
(2.1) is the time-independent spectral parameter, while the potential u(x, t) corre-
sponds to a solution of the CH equation. Solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation
may be obtained from the spectral problem above by means of the Inverse Scatter-
ing Transform, and the reader is referred to the works [11, 12] for further discussion
in this regard. A discussion of the Inverse Scattering Transform applied to con-
structing periodic solutions of the system (CH) may be found in [16, 6, 27]. We
note that in contrast to some previous works we shall omit the dispersion term
ux in the CH equation, and instead we will allow for a constant asymptotic value
u(x, t)

. This is the setup adopted in [52].

data is chosen such that q(x, 0) > 0. Symmetry of the Camassa-Holm equation

To implement the dressing method it is ﬁrst necessary to reformulate the spectral
problem in (2.1) as a matrix Lax pair. To achieve this we let φ1 denote an eigen-
function of equation (2.1), and we observe that the ﬁrst member of this spectral
problem may be reformulated as

where ¯λ denotes the complex-conjugate of λ. This reduction is found to arise due to
J. Moreover, the same Z2-symmetry reduction
the symmetry relation σ3Jσ3 =
is observed by the associated operator M(λ). A crucial result of the symmetry
relation (2.17) is that the potential h(y, t) must be real. Furthermore, since all
aspects of the spectral problem (2.16) obey the reductions in (2.17), the associated
solutions Ψ(y, t, λ) and the dressing factor g(y, t, λ) (cf. Section 3) observe the
following reductions:

3. The Dressing Method

3.1. The dressing factor. The soliton, cuspon and soliton-cuspon solutions have
N
associated discrete spectra containing a ﬁnite number distinct eigenvalues
n=1,
with the eigenfunctions of the spectral problem (2.13) being singular at these
discrete eigenvalues. Starting from a trivial (or bare) solution u(x, t) = u0, where
u0 is constant, with its associated eigenfunction Ψ0(x, t, λ), we may obtain an
eigenfunction Ψ(x, t, λ) corresponding to soliton solutions, via the dressing factor
g(x, t, λ), deﬁned by the following

λn}

The dressing factor g(x, t, λ) is singular at each λ = λn belonging to the discrete
spectrum, and is otherwise analytic for λ

In the following we shall work with the y-representation introduced in equa-
tion (2.13), which we implement via the diﬀeomorphism x = X(y, t). Under this
representation the dressing factor then satisﬁes

where g(y, t, λ) is to be interpreted as g(X(y, t), t, λ). Moreover, since the solution

Meanwhile, re-parameterising in terms of the y-variable, the eigenfunction of the
dressed spectral problem at λ = 0 (cf. equation (2.13)) may be written as

(3.5)

Ψ(X(y, t), t, 0) = g(y, t, 0)Ψ0(y, t, 0)K0,
where Ψ0(y, t, 0) is a solution of the bare spectral problem when λ = 0. Hence
SL(2) is an arbitrary constant matrix, a consequence of equa-
the matrix K0 ∈
tion (3.1). We note however that the t-dependence of the bare spectral function
Ψ0(y, t, λ) becomes singular when λ = 0, an observation which is immediately
obvious when we refer to the second equation of the spectral problem (2.14). As
such, in equation (3.5) we only consider the time-independent solution, namely,
the solution which satisﬁes the spectral problem corresponding to the L(λ = 0)-
operator.

To circumvent singular behaviour of Ψt(x, t, λ) at λ = 0, we note from equation
since q > 0 for all t. Speciﬁcally we ﬁnd

(2.12) that as x

t), we
of the ACH equation and imposing the change of variables (y, t)
obtain another solution once we determine x = X(y, t). In other words, if X(y, t) is
a solution of the Camassa-Holm equation then so too is x = ˜X(y, t) = X(

values which we denote iω1 and iω2, with residues 2iωkAk (k = 1, 2). Extending

Again, we note that the cuspon phase velocity may be either positive or nega-
tive, while the soliton phase velocity is strictly positive. Thus, the cuspon-soliton
interaction may arise in two forms, namely a right moving soliton interacting with
either left or right moving cuspon. Both scenarios are presented in the following:
In Figure 7 we present a cuspon-soliton interaction wherein both the cuspon and
soliton are moving to the right. In Figure 8 a cuspon-soliton interaction is shown
in which the solition is right moving while the cuspon moves to the left.

5. The geometry of the soliton and cuspon solutions

It is well known that the CH equation is closely related to the group of the
diﬀeomorphisms of the real line, cf. [30, 15]. We are going to explore this relation
in some more detail, making use of the variables that we have already evaluated
explicitly for the soliton and cuspon solutions. Let us consider a local chart pa-
Diﬀ(R) given by the coordinate X. Then
rameterisation of the Lie group
dX is the basis for the co-tangent bundle T ∗Diﬀ(R),
= P dX is a 1-form, and
ω = d
dX is the standard symplectic form. Thus, if (X, P ) are the canon-
ical Hamiltonian variables, then (dX, dP ) are the canonical local coordinates on
the phase space T ∗

in coordinate form is

Theorem 5.1. [39, 40] The dual space of g is a space of distributions but the
subspace of local functionals, called the regular dual g∗, is naturally identiﬁed with
the space of quadratic diﬀerentials q(x)dx2 on R. The pairing is given for any
vector ﬁeld u∂x ∈

Vect(R) by

6. Discussion

Since the emphasis of this study was on the Zakharov-Shabat dressing method
many important additional questions have been overlooked - such as the phase
0. These
shifts after the interaction and the peakon (antipeakon) limit when u0 →
issues have been studied previously, for instance in [49, 50, 51]. We mention only
that the cuspon behavior is very similar to the peakon behaviour, especially the
peakon-antipeakon interactions.

Another interesting aspect of the momentum map obtained here is that in the
peakon limit equation (5.2) becomes the well known singular momentum map used
for the construction of peakon, ﬁlament and sheet singular solutions for higher di-
mensional EPDiﬀ equations [29]. Holm and Staley [32] introduced the following
measure-valued singular momentum solution ansatz for the n
dimensional solu-
tions of the EPDiﬀ equation

These singular momentum solutions, called “diﬀeons,” are vector density functions
supported in Rn on a set of N surfaces (or curves) of co-dimension (n

Rk with k < n. They may, for example, be supported on sets of points (vector
