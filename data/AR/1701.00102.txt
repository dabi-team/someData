ABSTRACT
We present an investigation of the supernova remnant (SNR) G306.3−0.9 using
archival multi-wavelength data. The Suzaku spectra are well described by two-
component thermal plasma models: The soft component is in ionization equilibrium
and has a temperature ∼0.59 keV, while the hard component has temperature ∼3.2
keV and ionization time-scale ∼2.6 × 1010 cm−3 s. We clearly detected Fe K-shell line
at energy of ∼6.5 keV from this remnant. The overabundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe
conﬁrm that the X-ray emission has an ejecta origin. The centroid energy of the Fe-K
line supports that G306.3−0.9 is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova (SN) rather than a
core-collapse SN. The GeV gamma-ray emission from G306.3−0.9 and its surrounding
were analyzed using about 6 years of Fermi data. We report about the non-detection
of G306.3−0.9 and the detection of a new extended gamma-ray source in the south-
west of G306.3−0.9 with a signiﬁcance of ∼13σ. We discuss several scenarios for these
results with the help of data from other wavebands to understand the SNR and its
neighborhood.

1 INTRODUCTION

G306.3−0.9 is a new Galactic supernova remnant (SNR)
that was detected at mid-IR wavelengths by Spitzer at 24
µm (Carey et al. 2009) and WISE at 22 µm (Wright et al.
2010). Reynolds et al. (2013) presented a study of Chandra,
24 µm Spitzer and the 5 GHz Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) data. The Chandra spectrum was described
by a thermal plasma model (VNEI, VPSHOCK or Sedov)
with the absorption column density NH ∼ (1.94−1.96)×1022
cm−2. In their spectral ﬁtting, the ionization time-scale
shows that the plasma is approaching ionization equilibrium,
τ in the range of ∼(0.89−2.5)×1012 s cm−3.

Recently, Combi et al. (2016) studied the northeast,
central, and southwest part of the G306.3−0.9 using XMM-
Newton and Chandra data. They found that the X-ray spec-
tra were well represented by two absorbed VAPEC and
VNEI thermal plasma models with the absorption column
density NH ∼ (1.40−1.57)×1022 cm−2. They also found en-
hanced abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe in the VNEI
component, indicating that the X-ray emission has an ejecta

origin. The other thermal component is associated with the
swept-up interstellar medium (ISM).

Using the high-resolution Chandra data, Reynolds et al.
(2013) and Combi et al. (2016) concluded that G306.3−0.9
has a semi-circular and asymmetric X-ray morphology. The
X-ray emission of the southern region shows semi-circular
brightened structure, while the northern emission is very
weak. The image of the southern region is also consistent
with radio and IR observation. Reynolds et al. (2013) and
Combi et al. (2016) discussed the progenitor of this remnant
and favored a Type Ia supernova (SN) rather than a core-
collapse (CC) SN.

In the 1st SNR Catalog of the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on board Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope (Acero
et al. 2016), G306.3−0.9 was mentioned in the ‘SNRs Not
Detected by the LAT’ table (Table 3). However, another
nearby extended source, ‘G306.3−00.8’, was reported among
the ‘Other Detected Sources’, which are not classiﬁed as
SNRs. It was detected with a signiﬁcance of ∼9σ and the
best-ﬁtting location was found as R.A.(J2000) = 199◦.33 ±
0◦.07stat ± 0◦.17sys and decl.(J2000) = −62◦.96 ± 0◦.07stat ±
0◦.21sys. The extension (radius of a disk) of this source was
measured as 0◦.53 ± 0◦.07stat ± 0◦.07sys. The spectrum was
ﬁt to a power-law (PL) that yielded a photon ﬂux and a

photon index of (7.77 ± 0.94) × 10−9 ph cm−2 s−1 and Γ
= 2.56 ± 0◦.18stat ± 0◦.1sys, respectively. When Acero et al.
(2016) tested two alternative IEMs (the interstellar emis-
sion model, which accounts for gamma rays produced by
cosmic ray (CR) interactions with interstellar gas and radi-
ation ﬁelds in the Milky Way) for ‘G306.3−00.8’, they found
out that the source had an extended gamma-ray morphol-
ogy for one of the tested IEMs, and was a point-like source
(was not extended) for the other IEM.

The nearby gamma-ray source 3FGL J1317.6−6315 is a
pulsar candidate classiﬁed by two diﬀerent statistical pulsar
classiﬁcation methods (i.e. BLR: Boosted Logistic Regres-
sion & RF: Random Forest) in Saz Parkinson et al. (2016).
The location of the source given in the 3rd Fermi Source
Catalog (3FGL) is R.A.(J2000) = 199◦.403 and decl.(J2000)
= −63◦.259 and its detection signiﬁcance is about 13.5σ
(Acero et al. 2015). Another signiﬁcant gamma-ray source
close to G306.3−0.9 is the HESS unidentiﬁed object, HESS
J1303−631 (Aharonian et al. 2005; H.E.S.S. Collaboration
2011), which is interpreted as physically related to the pul-
sar PSR J1301−6305. It is assumed that the electrons ra-
diatively cool as they propagate away from the pulsar, such
that the highest-energy gamma rays are found close to the
pulsar and the lower-energy particles are mainly in the ex-
tended nebula. X-ray observations revealed a pulsar wind
nebula (PWN) around PSR J1301−6305 extending asym-
metrically roughly towards the gamma-ray source. The most
recent sensitivity proﬁle derived from the H.E.S.S. Galactic
Plane Survey (Donath et al. 2016) shows that the sensitivity
ranges between 1 and 2 per cent of the Crab Nebula, which
corresponds to about ∼1×10−11 erg s−1 cm−2 in 1−10 TeV,
but the point-like source signiﬁcance map shows no TeV
gamma-ray excess at or around the location of G306.3−0.9.
In this paper, we investigate the X-ray spectral proper-
ties and the explosion type of G306.3−0.9 based on a ∼190
ks Suzaku observation. We also analyzed 6-years of Fermi-
LAT data and interpreted the results with the help of multi-
wavelength data. This paper is organized as follows: The X-
ray and gamma-ray spectral analyses are described in Sec-
tion 2. The results are discussed in Section 3. Summary and
Conclusions are given in Section 4.

2 ANALYSIS

2.1 X-ray Observation and Data Reduction

We used an archival Suzaku data (Obs ID. 509072010). The
observation was performed by the X-ray Imaging Spectrom-
eter (XIS; Koyama et al. 2007) on 2014 August 20 for an
exposure time of ∼190 ks. The XIS instrument consists of
four X-ray CCD cameras on the focal planes of the X-Ray
Telescope (XRT; Serlemitsos et al. 2007). The XIS0, 2 and
3 cameras have front-illuminated (FI) CCDs, whereas the
XIS1 is back-illuminated (BI). XIS0, XIS1, and XIS3 were
available in this observation.

Data reduction and analysis were made with HEADAS
software version 6.16 and xspec version 12.9.0 (Arnaud
1996) with AtomDB 3.0.3 (Smith et al. 2001; Foster et al.
2012). The 5×5 and 3×3 editing mode event ﬁles were com-
bined using xis5×5to3×3 and xselect version 2.4b. The

vatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) radio contours at 843 MHz
(Whiteoak & Green 1996). The radio contour levels are 3, 5.2, 7.4,
9.6, 11.8, and 14 mJy beam−1. The source regions for the spec-
tra of the whole and the centre are shown by the solid circles.

area. For the background estimation, we excluded the calibration
regions and the source region from the dashed area.

ﬁle (ARF) for the spectral analyses are generated by the
xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tools, respectively (Ishisaki
et al. 2007).

2.2 X-ray Spectral Analysis

Figure 1 shows XIS image of G306.3−0.9 in the 0.3−10.0
keV energy band. In order to characterize the emission,
we extracted spectra from two circular regions centered at
the source location with radii of 1.0 arcmin (central re-
gion) and 2.5 arcmin (the whole SNR), and from an an-
nulus region (the rim region). These regions are shown by
the solid circles in the upper panel of Figure 1. For compari-
son, the radio data (J.A. Combi, private communication) at
843 MHz taken from the MOST Supernova Remnant Cata-
log (Whiteoak & Green 1996) are overlaid. The background
spectra were extracted from a source free region in the same
ﬁeld of view (FoV), which is shown as the dashed area in the
lower panel of Figure 1 excluding the calibration regions.

able (reduced χ2=2.8). Because the one-component plasma
model failed to reproduce the Fe-Kα line (∼6.5 keV) proﬁle
and the ﬁt gave a large reduced chi-squared value, we ﬁtted
the spectra with a two-component thermal plasma model, in
CIE (VAPEC model in xspec) and VNEI model. The abun-
dances of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe for the VNEI component are
free parameters. We also allowed the abundances of Ne and
Mg to vary freely. We found the abundances of Ne and Mg
are near solar values. Therefore, we ﬁxed them to the solar
value. For CIE component, the electron temperature and
normalization are free parameters, while the abundances of
all elements are ﬁxed to the solar values assuming that the
emission is from the shocked ISM. This ﬁt leaves a large
residual ∼1.2 keV that comes from the uncertainty of the Fe
L-shell data in the VNEI code. Thus we also added a narrow
Gaussian emission line at ∼1.2 keV. This additional Gaus-
sian line component does not aﬀect the best-ﬁt values for all
other model parameters. The ﬁt was improved to be χ2 =
1.18 (dof=1966). We also ﬁtted the spectra extracted from
the centre and the rim regions with an absorbed VAPEC
and VNEI model. The best-ﬁtting parameters are summa-
rized in Table 1, and the background-subtracted XIS spectra
are shown in Figure 2.

2.3 Gamma-ray Analysis

To search for a gamma-ray emission in the GeV energy
range, we analyzed the gamma-ray data of Fermi-LAT for
the time period of 2008-08-04 − 2016-03-23. In this paper
we used the Fermi analysis toolkit fermipy1.

Using gtselect of Fermi Science Tools (FST), we se-
lected the Fermi-LAT Pass 8 ‘Source’ class and front+back
type events coming from zenith angles smaller than 90◦
and from a circular region of interest (ROI) with a ra-
dius of 20◦ centred at the SNR’s radio position. The max-
imum likelihood ﬁtting method (Mattox et al. 1996) was
employed on the spatially and spectrally binned data using
the P8R2−SOURCE−V6 version of the instrument response
function. After the maximum likelihood ﬁtting between 200
MeV and 300 GeV, the detection signiﬁcance value is calcu-
lated, which is roughly the square root of the test statistics
(TS) value and larger TS values indicate that the null hy-
pothesis (maximum likelihood value for a model without an
additional source) is incorrect.

The model of the analysis region contains the diﬀuse
background sources and all the point-like and extended
sources from the 3rd Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (Acero et
al. 2015) located within a square region with side 15◦ cen-
tred on the ROI centre. All parameters of the diﬀuse Galac-
tic emission (gll−iem−v6.ﬁts) and the isotropic component
(iso−P8R2−SOURCE−V6−v06.txt) were freed. We also freed
all sources with TS > 10 and ﬁxed all sources with TS <
10.

The TS map created using this model showed gamma-
ray excess extending toward the south-west of G306.3−0.9.
To understand if this excess was related to the SNR, we
added this SNR as a point-like source with a PL-type spec-
tral shape into the background model, since there was no
gamma-ray source corresponding to G306.3−0.9 in the 3rd

energy band. The spectra are overlaid with the best-ﬁt model. The
bottom panel is the residuals of the data oﬀ the best-ﬁt model.

2.2.1 Background Estimation

For G306.3−0.9, the background emission contains the
non-X-ray background (NXB), cosmic X-ray background
(CXB) and Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE). The
NXB for the source and the background spectra were ex-
tracted from the night-earth data using xisnxbgen (Tawa
et al. 2008). The NXB was subtracted from the source
and the background data. We ﬁtted the NXB-subtracted
background spectrum with a model of Abs1×power-law +
Abs2×(apec+apec), where the apec is a collisional ioniza-
tion equilibrium (CIE) plasma model in the xspec. In this
ﬁtting, an absorbed two-temperature apec component rep-
resents the GRXE emission, while an absorbed power-law
model represents the CXB emission. To deﬁne the CXB
emission, we assumed a power-law shape with a photon in-
dex of 1.4, and a surface brightness of 5.4 × 10−15 erg s−1
cm−2 arcmin−2 in the 2−10 keV band (Kushino et al. 2002).
Next, we simulated the background spectra using the fakeit
command in xspec and subtracted it from the source spec-
tra. All spectra were grouped with a minimum of 30 counts
bin−1.

2.2.2 Spectral Fitting

We ﬁrst ﬁt the spectra of the whole region with an ab-
sorbed (TBABS: Wilms, Allen & McCray 2000) single-
component variable-abundance non-equilibrium ionization
(NEI) plasma model (VNEI model with NEI version 3.0 in
xspec). In this ﬁtting the absorbtion (NH), electron tem-
perature (kTe), and ionization parameter (τ =net) are free
parameters, where ne and t are the electron density and
elapsed time following shock-heating. The abundances of Si,
S, Ar, Ca, and Fe are free parameters, while the other abun-
dances were ﬁxed to the solar abundance (Wilms, Allen &
McCray 2000). This model gave a large reduced χ2 of 3.28
(dof=1975) with large residuals ∼1.20−1.23 keV and ∼6.5
keV. We reﬁt the spectra with Ne and Mg abundances var-
ied. The ﬁt improved but it was still not statistically accept-

Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (Acero et al. 2015). After creat-
ing a new TS map, including where G306.3−0.9 in the back-
ground model, south-west of the SNR position still showed a
signiﬁcant amount of gamma-ray excess spread across a wide
area. To account for this extended gamma-ray excess, we
added a new point-like source with a PL-type spectral shape
into the model, which we called ‘SourceA’ and found its
best-ﬁtting position. However, introducing SourceA into the
background model could not remove the excess of gamma
rays in the south-west of G306.3−0.9, which were distributed
in a region encircled by the signiﬁcance contours of 5σ. Fi-
nally, we tested diﬀerent models of extension (Radial Gaus-
sian and Disk) for SourceA having a PL-type spectrum. The
results of these analyses are summarized in Section 3.2.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 SNR Origin

Previous X-ray studies of G306.3−0.9 suggested a Type Ia
progenitor for this remnant (Reynolds et al. 2013; Combi
et al. 2016). Using Suzaku XIS data, we investigated the
explosive origin of G306.3−0.9. For this investigation, we
consider the abundance pattern and the centroid of the Fe-
K line of the remnant. To compare our data with the SN
explosion models, we calculated the abundance ratios of S,
Ar, Ca, and Fe relative to Si. Table 2 shows a comparison of
our best-ﬁtting relative abundances with the results from the
CC models (Woosley & Weaver 1995) for various progenitor
masses and Type Ia models (Nomoto et al. 1997; Badenes et
al. 2003). We also give the abundance ratios of S/Si, Ar/Si
and Ca/Si from Chandra/XMM-Newton data (Combi et al.
2016) in Table 2.

The abundance ratios of S/Si, Ar/Si and Ca/Si of
Suzaku and Chandra/XMM-Newton data are consistent with

12M(cid:12) CC model as seen Table 2. But our abundance ra-
tio of Fe/Si is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the 12M(cid:12)
CC model. This ratio is consistent with the CC model with
the progenitor mass of 11M(cid:12) and W7 model. All four ra-
tios are consistent with one or more of the four Type Ia
models. However, none of Type Ia models agrees with more
than two ratios. None of the ratios is consistent with the
15M(cid:12) CC model. Therefore, by looking at the results on
Table 2, neither Type Ia nor CC SN models are conclusive
for G306.3−0.9. However, the CC SN of a 15M(cid:12) progenitor
is ruled out for the origin of G306.3−0.9.
Recently, Yamaguchi et al.

systematically
searched for Fe-K emission from Galactic and LMC SNRs
using Suzaku data. They concluded that the centroid en-
ergy of the Fe-K emission and the ionization state of Fe are
a powerful tool for distinguishing progenitor types. They
found that Fe-Kα centroid energies are below ∼6.55 keV for
Type Ia SNRs and the Fe-K emission of Type Ia SNRs is sig-
niﬁcantly less ionized than in CC-SNRs. Combi et al. (2016)
obtained the centroid of the Fe-K line in the central region
of the SNR and estimated a centroid of 6.52±0.01 keV. They
concluded that this value consistent with a Type Ia origin.
In order to estimate the centroid energy of an Fe-Kα, we
ﬁtted the 5.0−8.0 keV spectra with a PL and a Gaussian.
We estimated the centroid energy of Fe-Kα for each region
and listed them in Table 1. The centroid energy of Fe-Kα is
supportive of the Type Ia SN origin.

3.2 Gamma-ray Results

We found no excess gamma-ray emission from the direction
of G306.3−0.9, where the upper limit at 95 per cent con-
ﬁdence level (CL) on the photon ﬂux and energy ﬂux was
found to be 1.3 × 10−8 photons cm−2 s−1 and 5.3 × 10−6
MeV cm−2 s−1, respectively.

background model and G306.3−0.9 is left in the model as a point-like source. On both panels, Suzaku X-ray counts (50, 200, 500) are
shown in yellow color, white lines show the CO intensity contours of 12.5 (dashed), 30 (solid), 55 (solid), 78 (solid), 101 (solid) K km

in magenta color. Right Panel: Both G306.3−0.9 and SourceA are included in the background model. The black contours on the left
panel and green contours on the right panel are for the gamma-ray TS values (25, 30, 40, 45, 49).

A new gamma-ray source was detected at the south-
west of the G306.3−0.9 position, which we designate as
‘SourceA’ in this analysis. Assuming that it is a point-like
source, the TS value of ∼94 was found and the best-ﬁtting
location of this source was found as R.A.(J2000) = 199◦.47
± 0◦.07stat and decl.(J2000) = −63◦.93 ± 0◦.07stat using the
localize method of FST. This new source has an oﬀset from
the radio location of the SNR by an amount of 0◦.575. At the
best-ﬁtting location, we found the spectral index to be Γ =
2.7 ± 0.1 for the PL-type spectrum. The total photon ﬂux
and energy ﬂux of SourceA is (1.43 ± 0.27) × 10−8 pho-
tons cm−2 s−1 and (8.10 ± 1.08) × 10−6 MeV cm−2 s−1,
respectively, for the point-like source model with PL-type
spectrum.

We used two extension models for the gamma-ray emis-
sion morphology of SourceA: Disk and Radial Gaussian
models, where the centres of these extension models were
kept at the best-ﬁtting location of SourceA. To detect the ex-
tension of a source, we used the TS of the extension (TSext)
parameter, which is the likelihood ratio comparing the likeli-
hood for being a point-like source (Lpt) to a likelihood for an
existing extension (Lext), TSext = 2log(Lext/Lpt). We tabu-
lated the ‘Extension Width’, which is the 68% containment
radius of the extension model (R68), and the correspond-
ing TSext values of these ﬁts in Table 3. The highest TSext
value was found as ∼40 and the total TS value of SourceA
was found to be 158 assuming the Disk like extension model.
Assuming a PL-type spectrum for this extended source, we

obtained Γ = 2.1 and the total photon ﬂux and energy ﬂux of
SourceA was found to be (1.9 ± 0.2) × 10−8 photons cm−2
s−1 and (2.07 ± 0.2) × 10−5 MeV cm−2 s−1, respectively.
These results found for SourceA are in agreement with the
ones that were given for G306.3−0.8 in the 1st Fermi-LAT
SNR Catalog (Acero et al. 2016). The TS map shown on the
Right Panel of Figure 3 was obtained after applying the Disk
like extension model to SourceA and adding SourceA to the
background model. The spectral energy distribution (SED)
of SourceA with a Disk extension and PL-type spectrum is
shown in Figure 4.

The upper limit at 95 per cent CL on the energy ﬂux
of G306.3−0.9 was found to be 2.7 × 10−6 MeV cm−2 s−1
adding SourceA as a point-like source with a PL-type spec-
trum and 3.1 × 10−6 MeV cm−2 s−1 adding SourceA as an
extended source with a PL-type spectrum.

3.3 Gamma-ray Variability and Pulsation

To see the long term variability in the light curve of SourceA,
we apply Fermi-LAT aperture photometry taking data from
the circular region of 0.2◦ around the best-ﬁtting position
of SourceA. Figure 5 shows the 1-month binned light curve,
where we checked for possible variations in the ﬂux levels. In
Figure 5 most of the ﬂux data points remain within the 1σ
and 3σ bands. One of the ﬂux data points with large error
bars is above 3σ, could be due to the contamination by the
nearby pulsar 3FGL J1317.6−6315. Therefore, by looking at
0.◦2 around the best-ﬁtting location of SourceA we conclude
that SourceA shows no variability including pulsations in
gamma rays.

To
around
G306.3−0.9 and SourceA, we used the carbon monox-
ide (CO) data collected by the Harvard-Smithsonian CfA
1.2 m Millimeter-Wave Telescope from the fourth quadrant
(DHT36)2 with a 0.◦25 beam sampling (Bronfman et al.
1989).

We checked the velocity integrated CO intensity (WCO)
in the whole velocity range integrated from −70 to +40 km
s−1, where the velocity intervals are divided such that each
range includes at least one cloud cluster peaking in tempera-
ture at a certain velocity. Figure 6 shows the WCO maps pro-
duced at diﬀerent velocity ranges of [−70,−50], [−50,−35],
[−35,−10] km s−1 from bottom right to left and [−10,0],
[0,15], [15,40] km s−1 from top right to left. The white con-
tours represent the TS values of SourceA gamma-ray data at
25, 30, 40, and 45, and yellow contours are the X-ray counts
at 50, 200 and 500. The color scale for WCO is set to the
same range for all plots, which is between 0.0 and 76.2 K km
s−1, with the WCO values peaking in the velocity range of
[−50,−35] km s−1. Calculating the distance for this velocity
range, we obtain a distance range of ∼3−6 kpc. The distance
of the clouds that coincide with SourceA are in the veloc-
ity range of [−35,−10] km s−1, where the distance range
calculated is ∼1−9 kpc. The distance range found here is
consistent with other measurements (Reynolds et al. 2013;
Combi et al. 2016), but it is not much constraining. So, we
will use the distance to the SNR as 8 kpc assuming that the
SNR lies at a ﬁducial distance of the Galactic center.

The total WCO value found for the regions overlapping
with SourceA and G306.3−0.9 is about 44 and 3 K km s−1,
respectively. Using the CO-to-H2 conversion factor of X =
1.8 × 1020 cm−2 K−1 km s−1 (Dame, Hartmann & Thaddeus
2001), we found N(H2) = 0.8 × 1022 cm−2 for SourceA and
N(H2) = 0.5 × 1021 cm−2 for G306.3−0.9.

There are two gamma-ray production scenarios involv-

ing molecular clouds (MCs): First model is the ‘interacting
cloud model’(Aharonian, Drury & Volk 1994; Inoue et al.
2012), where gamma rays are produced through the inter-
action of accelerated hadrons like protons with the molecu-
lar material of the MC producing neutral-pions, which then
decay into gamma rays. In the second scenario, the ‘illumi-
nated cloud scenario’(Yamazaki et al. 2006; Gabici, Aharo-
nian & Casanova 2009; Ohira, Murase & Yamazaki 2011),
cosmic rays (CRs) escape from the SNR and diﬀuse into
the nearby dense MCs producing gamma rays through the
neutral-pion decay.

The best evidence for the interacting cloud scenario, is
to detect maser emission at the location of the SNR interact-
ing with MCs. There are no masers reported at the locations
of G306.3−0.9 and SourceA indicating an interaction with
the MCs. By assuming a spherical geometry of the cloud,
we computed the average density of protons to be ∼3 pro-
tons cm−3 ∼14 protons cm−3 for G306.3−0.9 and SourceA,
respectively. These derived proton densities are much lower
in comparison to the densities derived for other SNRs, such
as 3C 391 and G349.7+0.2 (Ergin et al. 2014, 2015), that
are interacting with MCs.

However, although CO is the most widely used proxy
to track down molecular gas in the Galaxy, not all por-
tions of an MC containing H2 also contain CO. New data
from ESA’s Herschel Space Observatory (Herschel) (Pineda
et al. 2013) conﬁrmed this estimation by showing that al-
most one third of all molecular gas in the Milky Way had
remained undetected. Herschel’s survey has established the
three-dimensional distribution of the molecular gas across
the Milky Way using a diﬀerent tracer (ionized carbon (C+))
for H2. The densest MC cores of the ISM, where most of the
molecular gas resides, contain both H2 and CO, but their
immediate surroundings might be inﬂuenced by ultraviolet
radiation from nearby stars, where H2 and C+ are found to
coexist. ‘CO-dark’ molecular gas is named for regions of H2

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

mixed with CO that can not be traced by CO emission. The
Herschel data showed that CO-dark H2 accounts for about
30 per cent of the Milky Way’s entire reservoir of molecular
gas (Pineda et al. 2013).

Assuming there is a dense gas cloud at the location of
SourceA, we can interpret the results such that the CRs es-
caping from G306.3−0.9 reaching the dense MC at the loca-
tion of SourceA, causing the emission of gamma rays (the il-
luminated cloud scenario). SourceA has a radius of extension
of 0.◦72 and the angular distance between the radio location
of G306.3−0.9 and best-ﬁtting location of SourceA is 0.◦576,
which corresponds to a physical distance of 81 pc considering
an 8 kpc distance to the SNR and assuming that SourceA
is also at the same distance as the SNR. Gabici, Aharonian
& Casanova (2009) has shown in their Figure 5 left-most
panel, the gamma-ray energy ﬂux emitted from an MC of
mass 105 solar masses and at a distance of 1 kpc for the case,
where the distance between the SNR and MC is about 50
pc. Using the dotted line, which refers to the emission at a
time 2000 years after the SN explosion, we calculated the ex-
pected gamma-ray energy ﬂux emitted for 1 kpc of distance,
which is about 3 × 10−6 MeV cm−2 s−1 and 3 × 10−7 MeV
cm−2 s−1 for 10 and 100 GeV, respectively. After correcting
for the distance of 8 kpc, these values become ∼4 × 10−8
MeV cm−2 s−1 and ∼4 × 10−9 MeV cm−2 s−1 for 10 and
100 GeV, respectively. If the distance to SourceA is about
1 kpc, the SED data point at 10 GeV of SourceA shown in
Figure 4 is comparable to the expected gamma-ray energy
ﬂux from the illuminated clouds. If the distance of SourceA
is the assumed 8 kpc, comparing the estimated gamma-ray
energy ﬂux values of the illuminated clouds with the mea-
sured SED data points of SourceA shown in Figure 4, we
can conclude that the estimated gamma-ray energy ﬂux val-
ues are lower than the measured ones. So, there might be
a source of gamma rays other than the illuminated clouds

that is contributing to the total gamma-ray emission coming
from SourceA.

with variable source types, such as pulsars or binary sys-
tems.

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we examined the elemental abundances, ioniza-
tion state of plasma and the explosive origin of G306.3−0.9
using Suzaku observation and investigated the gamma-ray
emission from G306.3−0.9 and its neighborhood using the
Fermi-LAT data. Our main conclusions can be summarized
as follows:

(i) We found that the thermal X-ray emission from
G306.3−0.9 consists of two kTe plasmas. The overabun-
dances of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe in the hot temperature com-
ponent conﬁrm the ejecta-dominated nature of G306.3−0.9.
The low-temperature component is associated with an ISM
material. The regional spectral analysis shows that kTe,
abundances, and τ of the NEI component are generally high-
est for the Whole spectrum, compared to the mean values
found for the Center and the Rim. For example, abundances
of Si and Fe are signiﬁcantly higher for the Whole SNR than
those for the Center and the Rim, which could be a result
of systematic uncertainties. These systematic errors do not
aﬀect the conclusions drawn in this paper.

(ii) We clearly detected the Fe-K line emission in the
ejecta component of this remnant. Its centroid energy is sup-
portive of the Type Ia SN origin.

(iii) We compared the results of our spectral ﬁt to the
predicted abundances from CC (Woosley & Weaver 1995)
and Type Ia SN (Nomoto et al. 1997; Badenes et al. 2003)
models. The results show that neither Type Ia nor CC SN
of 11M(cid:12) and 12M(cid:12) progenitors is conclusively favored for
G306.3−0.9, while the CC SN of a 15M(cid:12) progenitor is ruled
out.

(iv) G306.3−0.9 is not detected in gamma-rays. X-ray ob-
servations of G306.3−0.9 revealed that the SNR is formed
in a supernova explosion of Type Ia and there is no com-
pact object. Additionally, synchrotron emission from a PWN
or X-ray ﬁlaments in the shell of the SNR was not ob-
served. So, we do not expect to see gamma-ray emis-
sion from G306.3−0.9 that could be produced by electrons
accelerated at the forward shock through the relativistic
bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering processes.
The alternative way of producing gamma rays would be
through the hadronic process, where accelerated hadrons
interact with the background gas and subsequently produce
gamma rays from the neutral pion decay. If G306.3−0.9 were
in a dense molecular cloud region, we might have been able
to detect hadronic gamma rays.

(v) A new extended gamma-ray source was located in
the south-west of G306.3−0.9, which we called ‘SourceA’
in our paper. The best-ﬁtting location of R.A.(J2000) =
199◦.47 ± 0◦.07stat and decl.(J2000) = −63◦.93 ± 0◦.07stat and
the extension parameters, as well as the spectral parame-
ters found for SourceA shows that this source is probably
‘G306.3−00.8’ reported in the 1st Fermi-LAT SNR Catalog
(Acero et al. 2016).

(vi) No variations or pulsations were detected in the
gamma-ray light curve of SourceA by looking at 0◦.2 around
the best-ﬁtting location of the SNR, eliminating scenarios

(vii) SourceA might be an independent

source of
G306.3−0.9. Due to the low molecular gas density at the lo-
cation of SourceA, a signiﬁcant contribution of the hadronic
gamma-ray emission is not expected. All ﬁve pulsar wind
nebulae (PWNe) detected by Fermi-LAT (Crab Nebula
(Abdo et al. 2010a), Vela X (Abdo et al. 2010b), MSH
15−52 (Abdo et al. 2010c), 3C 58 (Abdo et al. 2013b),
HESS J1640−465 (Slane et al. 2010)) have nearly ﬂat spec-
trum at the GeV energy range. The observed spectrum of
SourceA shown in Figure 4 is generally consistent with that
of a PWN. However, the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey
(Donath et al. 2016) has not reported a detection from the
direction of SourceA at a sensitivity level of 1−2 per cent
of the Crab Nebula, which corresponds to about 6.2 × 10−6
MeV cm−2 s−1. Tanaka et al. (2013) showed the properties
and the TeV detectability of the non-TeV PWNe. SourceA
could be a member of this group of PWNe, but there are
no observations in other wave-bands, especially in radio and
X-rays, at the location of SourceA so far, which could give
some clues on the nature of this mysterious object.
