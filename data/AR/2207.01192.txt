Abstract. KEK electron positron injector LINAC initiated the injection operation into
Photon Factory (PF) light source in 1982. Since then for 39 years, it has served for multiple
projects, namely, TRISTAN, PF-AR, KEKB, and SuperKEKB. Its total operation time has
accumulated 200 thousand hours on May 7, 2020. We are extremely proud of the achievement
following continuous eﬀorts by our seniors. The construction of the injector LINAC started
in 1978, and it was commissioned for PF with 2.5 GeV electron in 1982.
In parallel, the
positron generator linac was constructed for the TRISTAN collider project. The slow positron
facility was also commissioned in 1992. After the KEKB asymmetric-energy collider project
was commissioned in 1998 with direct energy injections, the techniques such as two-bunch
acceleration and simultaneous injection were developed. As the soft structure design of the
LINAC was too weak against the great east Japan earthquake, it took three years to recover.
Then the construction and commissioning for the SuperKEKB project went on, and the
simultaneous top-up injection into four storage rings contributes to the both elementary particle
physics and photon science.

1. Introduction
In the experimental particle physics research in the 1970s, there was growing expectation for the
world-class Japanese domestic collider after the successes in the world-level theoretical research.
On the other hand, in the ﬁeld of synchrotron radiation science, there were demands for the
establishment of a synchrotron radiation research institute with a dedicated accelerator.
In
order to realize both of those accelerator projects, a 400-m electron linear accelerator capable
of 2.5 GeV direct energy injection was constructed in 1982.

Since then, the injector had been in operation for 38 years in 2020, supporting the consecutive
accelerator projects of Photon Factory (PF), TRISTAN, KEKB, PF-AR, and SuperKEKB as

depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 5. It has ﬁnally achieved 200,000 hours of operation in May 2020.
The brief operation history would be given.

2. 2.5 GeV injection for PF/TRISTAN
At the time of the initial construction since 1978, several university-based accelerator facilities
had achieved research successes in Japan. It was fortunate that a new linear electron accelerator
had been built to share resources for advanced scientiﬁc research in both particle physics and
synchrotron radiation science, which were based on the accumulated experiences at universities.
The situation might be similar to recent J-PARC’s focus on both nuclear and particle physics,
as well as neutron and muon science. It seems that there are not many accelerator projects in
the world that have multiple disciplines from the beginning. Those Japanese accelerators are
quite unique that deliver beams for multiple science ﬁelds.

While many researchers of synchrotron radiation research wanted the institute independent
from particle physics, the accelerator science played a role as a bridge between those two. One
hundred sixty of 2-m-long S-band traveling-wave accelerating structures with 2π/3 mode quasi-
constant gradient were installed, and driven by forty 20-MW klystrons to achieve 2.5 GeV
electron and positron beams [1]. 2.5 GeV direct energy injection was made for PF and 2.5 GeV
electron positron beams from the injector were accelerated through the TRISTAN synchrotron
chain for the 32 GeV collision as depicted in Fig. 2.

When the synchrotron radiation facility, PF, was completed, there must be an enthusiastic
response to the dedicated synchrotron radiation facility that would promote research in

The TRISTAN project also began to take the lead in high-energy
experimental physics, after Japanese theorist had contributed to the worldwide development
of particle physics theory. It was realized recently that the speciﬁcations of the electric power
facilities built at that time secured the expansion possibility even for the ﬁelds of nuclear physics
and ultraviolet synchrotron radiation science. Such design facilitated the upgrades towards
KEKB and SuperKEKB later.

3. 8-GeV upgrade for KEKB
Since the construction of TRISTAN, a linear collider was expected as the next particle physics
experiment project.
Instead of immediately promoting a large scale collider, however, the
construction of a B Factory, KEKB, was carried out to experimentally conﬁrm the remaining
issues of CP violation in particle theory proposed by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa.
Since the injection performance was important to achieve the integral performance as a factory,
there were concerns compared to SLAC/PEP-II, which was planning the B-factory in parallel.
The direct energy injections for the asymmetric energy collider rings were realized by an
energy upgrade from 2.5 GeV to 8 GeV by introducing SLED microwave pulse compressors and
adding 50% more accelerating structures that extends the length of the injector up to 700 m in
a shape of a letter ‘J’ as in Fig. 3. It was a substantial and diﬃcult construction because the
injector continued the PF injection [2, 3]. It made maximum use of the opportunities of the
longest shutdown of nine months in 1997 during the construction.

The success of the KEKB operation was largely due to the online operating environment of
the SAD beam simulation software and the EPICS control framework which were developed
during the injector commissioning period [4].

KEKB and PEP-II projects developed the friendly competition, and they compared the
performance of the accelerators in those control rooms everyday [5]. The performance of the
KEK injector was gradually improved during the project step-by-step [6].

The positron beam injection was enhanced by employing dual bunch acceleration. The
separation of two bunches was chosen to be 96 ns because of the frequency relationship between
the injector and the ring [7].

Then later, it also succeeded in continuous injection by switching the injection every several
minutes while the Belle collision detector was in operation. In 2008, the injection was further

improved by the simultaneous top-up injection in to three storage rings except PF-AR in pulse-
to-pulse modulation switching beams with distinct properties every 20 ms employing event-based
control architecture [8] as in Fig. 4.

4. Slow positron and others
The injector facility usually contributes by injecting beams into the downstream storage rings.
However, there are cases where experiments are performed using direct electrons. In the past
at KEK LINAC, there have been experiments at the beam dump for a search for an axion like
particle, beam irradiation calibration of tile ﬁber calorimeter detectors for the SSC project,
positron beam channeling experiments, and positron production using electron channeling
radiation. As a result of the positron generation experiment, a crystal target was actually
applied to the positron generation for KEKB injection in 2006, and the positron generation
eﬃciency was successfully improved by about 25% [9].

Another ongoing project is the research experiments for material science and particle physics
by slow positrons. Between injections to the TRISTAN project slow positrons were generated
at the end of LINAC. While the experimental setup had to be moved twice due to the change in
the beam operation of the main LINAC, now a dedicated 50 MeV linac is used for slow positron
It is valuable to produce
experiments sharing the same resources as the main LINAC [10].
scientiﬁc results within the LINAC building.

5. SuperKEKB and simultaneous top-up injection
After the KEKB project was completed in 2010 the injector, whose girders were built with the
concept of a ﬂexible structure, suﬀered a serious damage due to the Great East Japan Earthquake
in 2011. While light source injections were recovered in 3 months, it took three years to start the

beam test for SuperKEKB as the alignment was severely deteriorated. Actually, the alignment
requirement became much tight in order to suppress the wakeﬁeld eﬀect in the accelerating
structure. While the light source injections were maintained even during the upgrade towards
SuperKEKB, the longest construction period of ﬁve months was secured in 2017.

The energy enhancement was the main subject for the previous KEKB injection upgrade, on
the other hand the SuperKEKB project required quality improvements of the injection beam
for the electron positron collision with the novel nano-beam scheme [11] as in Fig. 5. A beam
emittance of about 20 mm.mrad was required with a charge of 4 nC per bunch. The positron
capture section was reconstructed [12] in order to increase the positron charge employing a
ﬂux concentrator pulsed solenoid, large aperture S-band structures (LASs), long DC solenoid
magnets and a hundred of quadrupole focusing magnets. A damping ring was newly constructed
to damp the positron emittance. For the electron beam, a new high-current and low-emittance
RF gun was developed with an iridium-cerium photocathode and a quasi-travelling-wave side-
coupled cavity (QTWSC) [13].

More than hundred pulsed focusing and corrector magnets were newly installed [14]. Pulsed
low-level RF controls were also developed. Based on those equipment upgrades [15], the
simultaneous top-up injections for four storage rings of SuperKEKB HER, LER, PF ring and PF-
AR were realized in 2019, which contributed to the considerable improvement of experimental
eﬃciency [16].

The continuous operation of the electron-positron injector has supported the history of

advanced research at KEK by providing beams for various projects as shown in Fig. 1.

At 8:50 a.m. on May 7, 2020, 200,000 hours of operation was accomplished as shown in
Fig. 6, since the PF injection operation started in 1982. Authors are very proud to have reached
the milestone of 200,000 hours of operation by inheriting the operation results accumulated by
our predecessors. Although no special event was held due to the eﬀects of COVID-19, a toast
was made with morning coﬀee via video conference. In the statistics, the partial failure rate
indicates that a certain device has failed but the beam injection operation was still possible due
to redundancy, and the injection stop rate indicates that the failure was so serious that the beam
injection was impossible. At the beginning of each program, the failure rate increases before
understanding the equipment characteristics, but it tends to stabilize as countermeasures are
taken.
