The paper examines the boundary values of functions in Rt(K, µ) for certain compact subset

∞
Rt(K, µ) denote the closure in Lt(µ) of Rat(K). In the case that K is polynomially convex,
Rt(K, µ) = P t(µ), the closure of
in Lt(µ). Multiplication by z deﬁnes a bounded linear
operator on Rt(K, µ) which we will denote by Sµ. A rationally invariant subspace of Rt(K, µ)

the normalized Lebesgue measure dθ
we denote the support of ν by spt(ν). For a compact subset K, we denote the boundary of K
by ∂K. The inner boundary of K, denoted by ∂iK, is the set of boundary points which do not
belong to the boundary of any connected component of C

Rt(K, µ) by bpe(Rt(K, µ)) and set Mλ =

eλ(f ) analytic in B(λ0, δ)

for all f
Rt(K, µ). We denote the set of abpe’s for Rt(K, µ) by abpe(Rt(K, µ)). Clearly analytic bounded
point evaluations are contained in the interior of K.

Because of Thomson’s decomposition, the study of general P t(µ) can be reduced to the case
where P t(µ) is irreducible (contains no nontrivial characteristic functions) and abpe(P t(µ))
is a nonempty simply connected open set whose closure contains sptµ. Olin and Yang (1995)
shows that one can use the Riemann Mapping Theorem to further reduce to the case where
abpe(P t(µ)) = D. In this case, Aleman et al. (2009) obtained the following remarkable structural
theorem.
Aleman-Richter-Sundberg’s Theorem. Suppose that µ is supported in ¯D and is such that
abpe(P t(µ)) = D and P t(µ) is irreducible, and that µ(∂D) > 0. Then:
a) If f

Conway and Elias (1993) extends some results of Thomson’s Theorem to the space Rt(K, µ).

1 the corresponding summand Rt(Ki, µ

where for each i

it contains no non-trivial characteristic function. Furthermore, if Ui = abpe(Rt(Ki, µ
∆i )) for
|

1, then Ui is a connected region and the closure of Ui contains ∆i. The results includes both
Thomson’s theorem and results of Conway and Elias (1993).
It is evident that some restriction on the nature of C

K is necessary in order ensure (1-1) to
be valid in general. Because of Brennan’s decomposition under some additional conditions for
C
K, it is reasonable to assume, in the study of general Rt(K, µ), that Rt(K, µ) is irreducible
and abpe(Rt(K, µ)) is a nonempty connected open set whose closure contains sptµ. It is the
purpose of this paper to explore the boundary values of functions and indices of rationally
invariant subspaces for Rt(K, µ) and to extend Aleman-Richter-Sundberg’s Theorem.

\

\

Notice that it is possible for two compact sets, K1 and K2, to contain the support of µ
and satisfy Rt(K1, µ) = Rt(K2, µ). Thus giving conditions on a compact set K is inappropriate
unless attention is focused on the smallest compact set which yields the same set of functions.
Since K
σ(Sµ), the spectrum of Sµ, σ(Sµ) is the smallest set. We will always assume that
⊃
K = σ(Sµ).

For readability purpose, in section 2, we consider an important special case that the bound-
ary of unbounded component of C
K is the unit circle. Proposition 1, which locally estimates
the boundary values of Cauchy transform of an annihilating measure in the sense of capacitary
density, plays a key role in proving Theorem 1 that extends Aleman-Richter-Sundberg’s The-
orem. As a consequence, our approach provides an alternative short proof of Aleman-Richter-
Sundberg’s Theorem. The main diﬃculty in their original proof, in Aleman et al. (2009), is the
proof of the following inequality:

∂D, where C is some constant. Our proof does not depend
nontangentially for m-almost all z
on the inequality (1-2). However, we will also develop a more general version of (1-2) in section
3 (see Theorem 5). Proposition 2, which estimates the upper bound of Cauchy transform of
an annihilating measure, is used to prove Theorem 2 that extends Theorem C in Aleman et al.
(2009).

The purpose of section 3 is to investigate the boundary behaviors of the functions in Rt(K, µ)
for the boundaries other than the unit circle in section 2. Theorem 3 proves if Rt(K, µ) is
irreducible and there are ’big parts’ of C
∂K, then µ(E) = 0. In
the above example, the inner boundary M of K2 satisﬁes the property, so our result implies
νa(E) = 0. Therefore, it is not needed to investigate the values of functions in Rt(K2, ν) for the
boundary M. Theorem 3 can also be applied to those K for which the diameters of all components
of C
K are bounded away from zero. For example, if K in Theorem 1 or Theorem 2 satisﬁes
∂D is away from D
K. In the case, the nontangential limits
the property, then the carrier of µ
|
of functions in Rt(K, µ) can be deﬁned with respect to µ
∂D. Theorem 4 generalizes Theorem 1.

Finally, Theorem 5 generalizes the inequality (1-2) ((1.4) in Aleman et al. (2009)).

author reﬁnes the estimations for Cauchy transform, in Lemma 4 of Yang (2018), to study
the bounded point evaluations for rationally multicyclic subnormal operators. Also see the

In this section, we will concern the special cases where the outer boundary of K is the unit circle
∂D. Consequently, we provide alternative proofs of Theorem A and Theorem C in Aleman et al.

∂D, we deﬁne the nontangential approach region Γσ(z) to be the
B(0, σ). It is well known that the existence of nontangential
∂D is independent of σ up to sets of m-measure zero, so we will write
(z) a nontangential approach region. The following lemma is due to Lemma 1 in

Proof: Let S be a closed square whose edges are parallel to x-axis and y-axis. S is deﬁned

to be light if Area(S

K) = 0. S is heavy if it is not light.

∩

We now sketch our version of Thomson’s coloring scheme for Q with a given a positive integer

m. We refer the reader to Thomson (1991) and Thomson (1993) section 2 for details.

For each integer k > 3 let

be an enumeration of the closed squares contained in C with
edges of length 2−k parallel to the coordinate axes, and corners at the points whose coordinates
are both integral multiples of 2−k (except the starting square Sm1, see (3) below).
In fact,
Thomson’s coloring scheme is just needed to be modiﬁed slightly as the following:

Skj

{

}

(1) Use our deﬁnition of a light ǫ square.
(2) A path to

convex hull of Φ by Q).

∞

means a path to any point that is outside of Q (replacing the polynomially

(3) The starting yellow square Sm1 in the m-th generation is R. Notice that the length of

Sm1 in m-th generation is 1 (not 2−m).

We will borrow notations that are used in Thomson’s coloring scheme such as

{

n≥m, etc. We denote

Suppose the scheme terminates, in our setup, this means Thomson’s coloring scheme reaches
a square S in n-th generation that is not contained in Q. One can construct a polygonal path
P, which connects the centers of adjacent squares, from the center of a square (contained in Q)
adjacent to S to the center of a square adjacent to R so that the orange (non green in Thomson’s
coloring scheme) part of length is no more than Y ellowBuf f erm. Let GP =

3 Boundary values of Rt(K, µ) for certain K
In this section, we are concerning the boundary behaviors of functions in Rt(K, µ) near the
boundary of K (not necessarily outer boundary as in last section), in particular, the inner
boundary of K. Our approach in estimating Cauchy transform, in section 2, is concentrating on
the local behavior of the transform. This makes it possible to extend our methodology to more
general K. In order to apply our approach, the following requirements are needed.
(A) Plemelj’s formula must hold for the boundary points under consideration;
(B) Lemma 1 (2) and Lemma 2 shall be extended.

For (A), it is known that Plemelj’s formula holds for a Lipschitz graph (see Theorem 8.8
in Tolsa (2014)). So we will restrict our attention to the boundary of K which is a part of a
Lipschitz graph although Plemelj’s formula may hold for more general rectiﬁable curves.

We deﬁne the open cone (with vertical axis)
