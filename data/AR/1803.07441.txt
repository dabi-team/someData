Abstract— The local descriptors have gained wide range of attention due to  their enhanced discriminative abilities. It has been 
proved that the consideration of multi-scale local neighborhood improves the performance of the descriptor, though at the cost 
of increased dimension. This paper proposes a novel method to construct a local descriptor using multi-scale neighborhood by 
finding the local directional order among the intensity values at different scales in a particular direction. Local directional order 
is  the  multi-radius  relationship  factor  in  a  particular  direction.  The  proposed  local  directional  order  pattern  (LDOP)  for  a 
particular  pixel  is  computed  by  finding  the  relationship  between  the  center  pixel  and  local  directional  order  indexes.  It  is 
required to transform the center value into the range of neighboring orders. Finally, the histogram of  LDOP is computed over 
whole image to construct the descriptor. In contrast to the state-of-the-art descriptors, the dimension of the proposed descriptor 
does not depend upon the number of neighbors involved to compute the order; it only depends upon the number of directions. 
The introduced descriptor is evaluated over the image retrieval framework and compared with the state-of-the-art descriptors 
over challenging face databases such as PaSC, LFW, PubFig, FERET, AR, AT&T, and ExtendedYale. The experimental results 
confirm the superiority and robustness of the LDOP descriptor.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Facial image analysis such as face recognition, face retrieval and facial expression recognition is being widely studied by 
the  researchers  during  the  last  few  decades.  Recently,  face  recognition  techniques  in  the  unconstrained  environment  is 
gaining much interest of the researchers, where either the images are collected from the internet such as ―Labeled Faces in 
the Wild‖ [1] and ―Public Figures‖ [2] or, the images are taken from the surveillance cameras and mobile devices [3]. The 
major  problem  with  face  image  analysis  is  the  sensitivity  to  the  image  capturing  environments  such  as  pose  variations, 
scale change, illumination difference, blurring effect,  viewpoint change, and noise [4], [5]. To deal with the face images 
with  these  geometric  and  photometric  challenges,  it  is  required  to  develop  robust  methods  capable  of  handling  adverse 
imaging  conditions.  The  advancement  and  recent  trends  in  the  effective  solution  for  face  image  analysis  have  been 
extensively reviewed by several researchers from time to time [6], [7], [8].  

Any  face  recognition  approach  mainly  has  two  components:  face  description  and  face  matching  using  the  multi-class 
classifiers  such  as  nearest  neighbor  (NN)  classifier  and  sparse  representation  classifier  (SRC)  [9].  The  image  feature 
description has been proved to be the backbone in most of the computer vision problems. An efficient feature descriptor is 
expected  to  have  the  following  three  properties:  a)  distinctive,  b)  robust,  and  c)  low  dimensional.  In  this  paper,  a  local 
directional order pattern (LDOP) based face representation is proposed for face retrieval as illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the 
intensity order among neighbors at different radius in a particular direction is used to get the local directional orders. Then, 
the original image is transformed into the range of local directional orders. After that, the proposed descriptor is computed 
by encoding the relationship  between transformed image and local directional orders.  At last, the  most  similar  faces  are 
retrieved from the database on the basis of the distances between the descriptors of the query image and database images. 

The  rest  of  paper  is  organized  in  following  manner:  Section  2  discusses  the  related  works;  Section  3  introduces  the 
construction process of proposed LDOP descriptor as well as multi resolution LDOP descriptor; Section 4 presents the face 
retrieval framework using multi resolution LDOP descriptor; The experimental analysis over benchmark face databases are 
carried out in Section 5; and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper with motivating remarks about LDOP descriptor.

2. RELATED WORKS 
Face description is required to make the face recognition approaches robust to intra-class variations and discriminative to 
inter-class similarities. The face image-descriptor based methods [10], [11], [12], [13], and deep learning based methods 
[14], [15], are the two major approaches widely adapted in the research community, for face retrieval. The advantages of 
former  methods  are  data  independence,  ease  of  use,  no  complex  computation  facility  needed  and  robustness  to  real-
situation variations like rotation, scale, expression and illumination differences.  

The  image-descriptor  based  methods  can  be  further  classified  into  two  categories,  i.e.,  hand-crafted  descriptor  and 
learning based descriptor.  The designing of hand-crafted image descriptors are the mostly followed research area for  the 
face representation. The local binary pattern (LBP) is proved as a very efficient and simple feature descriptor to capture the 
micro  information  of  the  image  [16],  [17]. The  LBP based  approaches  have  shown  promising  performance  for  different 
computer vision applications such as texture classification and retrieval [18], [19], [20], [21]. Ahonen et al. investigated the 
suitability  of  LBP  for  the  face  recognition  task  [10].  They  computed  the  LBP  descriptor  over  several  blocks  and 
concatenated  to  form  a  single  descriptor.  This  approach  outperformed  the  classical  methods  such  as  PCA,  Bayesian 
Classifier  and  Elastic  Bunch  Graph  Matching.  Recently,  Huang  et  al.  surveyed  the  LBP  based  approaches  for  face 
recognition [22] and Yang and Chen [23] have presented a comparative study over LBP based face recognition techniques. 
Several local descriptors have been investigated for face recognition inspired by the success of LBP [13], [24], [25], [26], 
[27],  [28],  [29],  [30],  [31],  [32],  [33],  [34].  Zhang  et  al.  modeled  a  Local  Gabor  Binary  Pattern  Histogram  Sequence 
(LGBPHS) by concatenating the histograms of all the local regions of all the local Gabor magnitude binary pattern maps 
for a face image [24]. The LGBPHS consists of histograms at different scale and orientation which make it more effective 
than LBP. The local ternary pattern (LTP) is proposed for illumination robust face recognition by considering ternary value 
against  binary  value  of  LBP  and  shown  promising  performance  [25].  The  LTP  descriptor  is  more  discriminant  and  less 
sensitive to noise in uniform regions. Zhang et al. did a revolutionary work over LBP and considered LBP over high-order 
derivatives of the image to introduce local derivative pattern (LDP) for face representation [26]. The pattern at high-order 
local  derivative  captures  more  detailed  information  as  compared  to  the  first  order  local  pattern.  Weber  local  descriptor 
(WLD)  is  proposed  for  faces  and  texture  recognition  with  inspiration  from  the  Weber’s  theory  [27].  Local  Gabor  XOR 
pattern  (LGXP)  is  introduced  by  utilizing  the  Gabor  magnitude  and  phase  information  in  the  LBP  framework  [28].  The 
LBP  feature  on  orientated  edge  magnitudes  is  computed  to  form  the  Patterns  of  Oriented  Edge  Magnitudes  (POEM) 
descriptor [29]. Multiscale local phase quantization (MLPQ) is proposed for blur-robust face recognition by encoding the 
blur-invariant  information  in  face  images  [30].  Local  directional  number  pattern  (LDN)  used  the  prominent  direction 
computed  from  Kirsch  masks  to  get  the  pattern  [31].  The  LDN  does  not  utilize  the  wider  neighborhood,  whereas  the 
proposed  approach  does.  The  LDN  requires  the  computation  of  edge  response,  whereas  our  approach  requires  the

computation of directional order. Recently, the concept of LDP descriptor is extended by Fan et al. into local vector pattern 
(LVP) for face representation [32]. They encoded the relationship of referenced pixel with neighbouring pixels in different 
directions  at  different  distances  over  high-order  face  image.  The  proposed  Local  Directional  Order  Pattern  (LDOP)  is 
different  from the  Local Vector Pattern (LVP). The proposed LDOP descriptor encodes  the directional ordering pattern, 
whereas the LVP descriptor encodes the relationship between the differences of intensity at different directions. Unlike the 
LDOP  descriptor,  the  LVP  descriptor  works  on  high-order  image  space.  The  only  similarity  between  both  is  that  both 
incorporate  the  directional  information.  The  unique  novelty  of  LDOP  is  that  it  uses  the  intensity  order  along  different 
directions  to  form  the  descriptor.  Basically,  it  encodes  the  relationship  among  the  directional  order  pattern.  The  semi-
structure local binary pattern (SLBP) derived the LBP over locally aggregated image (i.e. the center is replaced by sum of 
intensities  from  its  3×3  window)  for  facial  analysis  [33].  Other  notable  descriptors  for  face  recognition  include  local 
directional  gradient  pattern  (LDGP)  [34]  and  dual  cross  patterns  (DCP)  [13].  The  relationships  between  higher  order 
derivatives in four directions are utilized to encode the LDGP [34]. DCP works by computing the two cross patterns with 
different set of neighbors selected from two different radiuses [13]. This work uses the first derivative of Gaussian operator 
(FDG) to convert the face image into multi-directional gradient image which in terns increases the dimension of the final 
descriptor [13]. Arandjelovi has proposed the gradient edge map features for face recognition, where he directly compared 
the feature images instead of forming the descriptor [35]. This method can be used only for the frontal images. 

A harvesting visual concept is used in [56] for image search with complex queries. Researchers have also explored the 
Wavelet-based feature descriptors for different applications such as image retrieval and watermarking [57], [58], [59]. In 
recent  years, several learning-based descriptors using supervised and unsupervised techniques have evolved. Some  well-
known  descriptors  in  this  category  are  Learning-based  (LE)  Descriptor  [11],  Learned  Background  Descriptor  [12], 
AdaBoost Multi-scale Block LBP [36],  Local Quantized Patterns (LQP) [37],  Discriminant Face Descriptor  (DFD) [38], 
and Compact Binary Face Descriptor (CBFD) [39]. The learning-based descriptors are having the wider diversity in terms 
of the larger sampling size as compared to the hand-crafted descriptors. 

There are two  kinds of order based descriptors, one using  LBP framework in  high-order derivative space and another 
using intensity order among  neighboring  values  for local region  matching. Some examples of  former approach are  LDP 
[26]  and  LDGP  [34].  Recently,  the  intensity  order  based  descriptors  have  been  introduced  for  feature  description  and 
applied  mainly  to  the  local  region  matching  [40],  [41],  [42],  [43].  The  Local  Intensity  Order  Pattern  (LIOP)  is  widely 
known  due  its  simplicity  and  robustness  for  region  matching  [41].  Using  intensity  order  as  compared  to  raw  intensity 
values provides the inherent robustness to the descriptor over uniform illumination changes. The LBP descriptor [10] has 
been  successful  in  several  computer  vision  applications.  It  has  been  also  observed  that  the  performance  of  LBP  can  be 
boosted further by considering it at the higher scales at the cost of high dimensionality. The LBP is suitable for capturing 
the  micro  information,  whereas  it  fails  to  capture  the  macro  information  from  the  image  due  to  the  limited  local 
neighbourhood.  Some  LBP  variants  consider  the  multiple  scales  but  do  not  utilize  the  relationship  among  neighbours  at 
different scales which leads to high dimensionality. 

 In this work, we utilize the properties of intensity order over directional neighbors to solve the following two problems: 
to  encode the  wider neighborhood to discriminate  the inter-class similarity and to have the robustness  for the  intra-class 
variations. Next we illustrate the process of constructing the proposed LDOP descriptor.

3. LOCAL DIRECTIONAL ORDER PATTERN 
We describe the proposed LDOP descriptor first, followed by the multi-resolution LDOP descriptor. 

A.  Proposed LDOP Descriptor 

In  this  sub-section,  the  construction  process  of  local  directional  order  pattern  is  described.  First,  we  discuss  the  local 
directional neighborhood extraction, then local directional order computation, then center pixel transformation, and finally 
the construction of local directional order pattern. 

Local Directional Neighbors 

Let  𝐼 is an image with dimension          and having a bit-depth of    bits. Let  𝐼    represents the intensity value at co-
    is the intensity value of 𝑘   neighbor of 
ordinate (    ), where           ,            and     𝐼      (   −  ). Let 𝐼   
the center pixel (    ) when total   neighbors are considered equally spaced at a radius of    from the center as shown in 
 . The co-ordinates of 𝑘   neighbor at 
Fig. 2. Let (  
radius   (i.e.,   

 ) is the co-ordinates of 𝐼   
 ) is given as follows, 

   , then we can also say that 𝐼   

      𝐼  

  and   

      −  (   (𝜃 ))                                                                                               ( ) 
         (   (𝜃 ))                                                                                               ( ) 
where 𝜃        is the angular displacement of 𝑘   neighbor from     neighbor in counter-clockwise direction, w.r.t. center 
pixel and computed as follows, 

𝜃    (𝑘 −  )

 𝜋

                                                                                                  ( ) 

It  is  obvious  that  𝜃   represents  the  𝑘    direction  w.r.t.  the  center.  We  refer  the  intensity  value  of       neighbor  (i.e., 
   . We define    directional neighbors of center  (    ) in  𝑘   

neighbor at radius    from the  center) in  𝑘   direction by  𝐼   
. So,       
direction by a vector       

 will consist of the following neighboring values, 

    (𝐼   

     𝐼   

         𝐼   

         𝐼   

   )                                                                                    ( ) 

Local Directional Orders 

In multi-scale descriptors like LVP [32], the relationship among neighbors at different radius is not encoded. In this work, 
we  encode  the  relationship  among  the  local  neighbors  at  different  radius  (i.e.,  distance  from  the  center)  in  a  particular 
direction to encode the directional relationship among neighbors. 

Let       

 is the sorted version of       

 in the increasing order. We represent       

 as follows, 

    (    

   )                                                                                ( ) 

The order in the 𝑘   direction is represented by       

 and defined as follows, 

  (    

   )                                                                                ( ) 

such that  

where 

and 

𝐼   

                                                                                                 ( ) 

                     , 

       . 
Now, we are having   distinct values in 𝑘   directional order       

to represent the order using a single value.  

 for which we have to compute an index value

The order index

This idea is illustrated in Fig. 3, where by encoding the relationship exist among the    neighbors in 𝑘   direction (i.e.,

useless  information,  whereas,  LDOP  is  avoiding  useless  information.  Moreover,  it  can  be  noted  that  LDOP  is  capturing 
more  detailed  information  for  lower  value  of     using  narrow  neighborhood  and  capturing  more  corus  information  for 
higher value of R using wider neighborhood.

The multi resolution      accumulates the      descriptors at different scales/radius. It actually exhibits the progressive 
effect  of  increasing  the  area  of  local  neighborhood  over  the        descriptor.  We  define  the  multi  resolution 
                            as follows, 

                                                                                                        (  ) 
The  dimension  of  multi  resolution        is  given  by  (   −       )     .  The  construction  of  multi  resolution       
with 2, 3 and 4 radius of neighborhoods is illustrated in Fig. 5 using the same example image considered in Fig. 4(a). The 
     maps at different radius (i.e.       ,       , and       ) are derived first and then the feature vector using 
histograms  over  each  map  is  concatenated  to  form  the  final        multi  resolution  descriptor,  which  is  used  for  face 
retrieval.

4. FACE RETRIEVAL USING LDOP  
The framework for face retrieval using the proposed multi resolution LDOP is depicted in Fig. 1. For query image as well 
as database images, LDOP based descriptors are computed. The LDOP descriptor of query face is compared with all the 
faces of the database by finding the distances between them. Based upon the lower distances, top   faces are retrieved from 
the database. In this paper, Chi-square distance is used in most of the experiments, whereas the performance of proposed 
descriptor with other distances like  Euclidean distance, Cosine distance,  L1 distance, and D1 distance is also investigated 
[20], [44]. 

A.  Evaluation Criteria 

In  face  retrieval,  the  ultimate  goal  is  to  retrieve  the  most  similar  faces  against  a  query  face  from  a  face  database.  For 
evaluation purpose, we converted each face image of the database into the query image and retrieved top    faces from the 
database. Note that, the query face image is also present in the database, thus, the first retrieved face is the query face itself. 
The  Precision  and  Recall  metrics  are  used  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  different  descriptors  for  face  retrieval.  The 
average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) for a given database are defined as follows, 

∑   ( )

∑   ( )

                                                                                               (  ) 

                                                                                               (  ) 

where     represent  the  total  number  of  classes  in  the  database,    ( )  and    ( )  represent  the  average  precision  and 

average recall respectively over the images of the ith class of the database and given as follows,

                                                                                       (  ) 

where    represent the number of face images in the ith class of the database, Pr and Re represent the precision and recall 

respectively for a query face and defined as follows, 

  (𝑘)     [    ]  

  (𝑘)     [    ]  

                                                                   (  ) 

                                                                (  ) 

where   represent the number of retrieved faces when 𝑘   image of     class is considered as the query face. 
We  also  computed  the  F-Score  from  ARP  and  ARR  in  terms  of  the  number  of  top  matching  retrieved  images.  The 
average normalized modified retrieval rank (ANMRR) metric is also computed and represented in percentage in this paper 
[45]. The higher value of ARP, ARR and F-Score means the better retrieval performance and vice-versa, whereas the lower 
value of ANMRR represents the better retrieval performance and vice-versa. 

B.  Face Databases 

We  have  used  seven  face  databases  namely  PaSC  [46],  LFW  [1],  [47],  PubFig  [2],  FERET  [48],  [49],  AR  [50],  [51], 
AT&T [52] and ExtendedYale [53], [54], for the face retrieval. After localization, all the face images are down-sampled in 
64×64 dimension.  The PaSC  still images face  database is very challenging due  to  many variations present such as  pose, 
illumination  and  blur  [46].  Total  9376  images  from  293  subjects  with  32  images  per  subject  are  present  in  the  PaSC 
database. We used Viola Jones object detection method [55] for face localization over PaSC images. Finally, we have 8718 
faces in this database where faces are successfully detected using Viola Jones detector. 

The  face  retrieval  in  unconstrained  environment  is  a  fundamental  problem.  LFW  and  PubFig  databases  contain  the 
images  collected  from  the  internet.  These  images  are  captures  in  completely  unconstrained  environments  with  non-
cooperative subjects. Thus, the variations like pose, lighting, expression, scene, camera, etc. are present. The gray-scaled 
version of LFW cropped database [47] is used in this paper. In image retrieval framework, it is required to retrieve more 
than one (typically 5, 10, etc.) best matching images. So, in our database, the sufficient number of images should be present 
in each category. Thus, we have considered only those subjects that are having at least 20 images. Finally, in this database,

there are 3023 face images from 62 individuals. The PubFig (i.e. PublicFigure) database is having 60 individuals with 6472 
number of total images in the database [2]. We have downloaded the images from the internet directly following the urls 
given in this database and removed the dead urls. 

―Portions of the research in this paper use the FERET database of facial images collected under the FERET program, 
sponsored by the DOD Counterdrug Technology Development Program Office‖ [48], [49]. Due to the severe variations in 
the expression and pose (13 different poses), Color-FERET database is adopted as a challenging database. We considered 
only those subjects that are having at least 20 images, converted the color images into gray-scale images. Finally, FERET 
database  is  having  141  subjects  with  4053  total  number  of  images.  The  AR  face  databases  exhibit  different  facial 
expressions,  illumination  conditions  and  occlusions  [50].  We  have  used  the  cropped  version  of  this  database  [51]  and 
converted the color image into gray-scaled image. The AR database consists of a total 2600 images from 100 individuals 
with 26 images per individual. The AT&T face database (formerly ―The ORL Database of Faces‖) is having 10 images per 
subject  from  40  different  subjects  [52].  There  are  variations  in  the  lighting  conditions  and  facial  expressions  for  some 
subjects. A dark homogeneous background is used to capture the images in AT&T database with the subjects in an upright, 
frontal position. The ExtendedYale database is having gray-scaled cropped and aligned faces [53], [54]. This database is 
created in the controlled lighting environment having severe and non-uniform illumination changes. Total 38 subjects are 
present in the database. Each subject is having 64 images with 2432 total images in this database.

5. EXPERIMENTS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
In this section, first we analyze the effect of radius of local neighborhood and multi resolution over LDOP descriptor; then, 
we  compare  the  results  with  existing  descriptors  over  seven  challenging  face  databases;  and  finally,  we  investigate  the 
effect of distance measures. The Chi-square distance measure is used for the experiments until or otherwise specified. In 
order to demonstrate the improved performance of proposed LDOP descriptor for face retrieval, we compare the proposed 
method with state-of-the-art face descriptors such as LBP [10], LTP [25], LDP [26], SLBP [33], LVP [32], LDGP [34] and 
DCP  [13].  Note  that,  all  these  descriptors  have  shown  very  promising  performance  for  facial  analysis  under  different 
imaging conditions such as rotation, scale, background, blur, illumination, pose, masking, etc. We have used radius        
for  LBP,  LTP,  LDP,  SLBP  and  LDGP  and         for  LVP  and  DCP  as  per  the  source  papers  of  these  descriptors.  The 
number of local neighbors (i.e.,  ) at a fixed radius is 8 for all the descriptors in all the experiments. 

A.  Effect of Radius and Multi Resolution 

The  effect  of  radius  of  local  neighborhood  (i.e.,   )  over  LDOP  descriptor  is  observed  in  this  experiment  over  each 
database. Fig. 6 illustrates the results in terms of the F-score for top 10 retrieved images. The number of local neighbors 
(i.e.,  ) at a fixed radius is 8 for LDOP in all the experiments. In Fig. 6, the values of   considered for LDOP are 2, 3, 4, 5 
and 6, whereas the range of value of   considered for multi resolution LDOP are 23, 24, 25, 56, 46, 36, and 26. Here the 
range  written  in  two  digit  like      represents  the  multi  resolution  LDOP  with                             .  Over  LFW 
database,  the  performance  of  LDOP  is  improving  with  increase  in  the  local  neighborhood  area  with          as  best 
performing combination. It can be observed that the performance of  LDOP over FERET database is better if combining 
lower  values of R such as 23, 24, and 25. This behavior of  LDOP is due to the presence of  huge pose  variations in the 
FERET database which restricts to consider very wide local neighborhood. The best result over AR database is obtained 
for      . Due to the non-uniform illumination variations, the result for higher values of    is not improved as directional 
order is getting affected much. The AT&T database is also having some amount of pose variations, thus the performance is 
improving upto       over this database. It is observed that the best performance of LDOP is obtained at different settings 
for different databases. Still, in the rest of experiments, we use multi resolution       . 

B.  Results Comparison 

The comparison results in terms of the ARP, ARR, F-score, and ANMRR against the number of retrieved images (i.e.   ) 
are shown in Fig. 7 over PaSC, LFW, PubFig, FERET, AR and AT&T face databases. It is clear from this result that the 
performance  of  LDOP  descriptor  is  outstanding  as  compared  to  the  other  descriptors  over  these  challenging  databases. 
These databases are having pose, illumination, scale, unconstraint and expression variations, thus it is deduced that LDOP 
is more robust and discriminative as compared to LBP, LTP, LDP, SLBP, LVP, LDGP and DCP descriptors against these 
variations. DCP is the second best performing  method in  most of the cases. The PaSC  database is having  very complex 
variations like blur, illumination and pose and it is observed that LDOP is much suitable to this database. The images in 
LFW  and  PubFig  databases  are  taken  in  totally  uncontrolled  manner.  The  outperformance  of  proposed  descriptor  over 
LFW  and  PubFig  databases  evidences  the  utilization  of  wider  neighborhood  for  more  discriminability.  The  FERET 
database is having images with huge pose differences. The better performance using LDOP over FERET database suggests 
that LDOP is more robust for pose variations than state-of-the-art descriptors. Over AR database, the proposed descriptor 
has the comparable performance to DCP. The reason of such behavior is related to the complex illumination change and 
masked  faces  that  many  faces  in  AR  database  have.  The  performance  of  LDOP  under  complex  illumination  will  be 
analyzed  in  next  sub-section  over  ExtendedYale  database.  The  proposed  descriptor  is  also  good  enough  for  the  frontal 
faces  as  its  performance  is  outstanding  among  all  the  descriptors  over  AT&T  database.  It  is  also  observed  that  the 
improvement using multi resolution LDOP is more significant over LFW and AT&T databases, whereas if we use LDOP 
at lower radius then the improvement over FERET and AR databases will be also significant as suggested by the results 
analysis of Fig. 6. The main problem with LBP, LTP, LDP, SLBP, LDGP and DCP is due to the lack of utilization of the 
relationship among the dense local neighbors. Basically, these methods use only the local neighbors at a specific radius. 
Whereas, the proposed LDOP method uses the dense local neighborhood. Moreover, most of the existing descriptors miss 
to utilize the relationship among local neighbors. The LVP descriptor encodes the relationship between the differences of 
intensity at different directions, whereas, the proposed LDOP descriptor encodes the directional ordering pattern, whereas. 
Unlike the LDOP descriptor, the LVP descriptor works on high-order image space. The dimensions of the descriptors are 
as  follows:  LBP  (256),  LTP  (512),  LDP  (1024),  SLBP  (256),  LVP  (1024),  LDGP  (65),  DCP  (512),  and  LDOP  (768). 
However, the performance of LDOP is superior. It points out that the dimension alone is not the key factor that influences 
the discriminativeness of LDOP, because LDP and LVP has higher dimension than proposed method.

C.  Performance under Severe Illumination Changes 

Even though the intensity order is invariant to only uniform illumination change, we experiment using proposed method 
under  non-uniform  illumination  change  also.  We  conduct  an  experiment  over  ExtendedYale  face  database  to  test  the 
robustness of proposed descriptor towards non-uniform and severe illumination changes. The results in terms of the ARP, 
ARR, F-Score and ANMRR are presented in Fig. 8 over ExtendedYale face database. Despite of the sensitivity of intensity 
order  towards  non-uniform  intensity  changes,  LDOP  is  the  second  best  performing  descriptor  over  ExtendedYale  face 
database. Moreover, its performance is significantly improved as compared to DCP for more number of retrieved images.

The performance of LVP is better in this scenario due to the non-uniform light change under extreme lighting conditions. 
The LDOP uses the order which may not be preserved in case of non-uniform light change. This is one of the limitations of 
proposed method. 

D.  Effect of Distance Measure 

We also investigate the effect of different distances over the performance of proposed LDOP descriptor over each database 
in Table 1. Euclidean, Cosine, L1, D1 and Chi-square distances are used. In this table, the results are presented using ARP 
values  in  percentage  for  top  5  numbers  of  retrieved  images.  It  is  found  that  the  ARP  values  using  Chi-square  distance 
measure is more as shown in bold in Table 1 over each database except AT&T. Thus, it is suggested to use the Chi-square 
distance with LDOP descriptor for face matching. 

6. CONCLUSION  
A local directional intensity order pattern (LDOP) based descriptor is proposed in this paper for robust face retrieval.  The 
LDOP  concept  facilitates  to  utilize  wider  local  neighbors  without  increasing  the  dimension  of  the  descriptor.  The 
directional  intensity  order indexes are used to encode the relationship among directional neighbors. This also provides a 
way to converge the wider neighborhood into the compact form. The center pixel values are transformed in the range of 
directional order indexes to find the LDOP pattern. The LDOP is also investigated using multi resolution mechanism. The 
retrieval results are compared over  seven benchmark face  databases (i.e., PaSC,  LFW,  PubFig,  FERET, AR,  AT&T and 
ExtendedYale)  having  different  kind  of  variations  such  as  pose,  illumination,  scale  and  expressions.  Promising 
performance  of  proposed  LDOP  descriptor  is  observed  as compared  to  the  seven  recent  state-of-the-art  face  descriptors. 
The  experimental  results  suggest  that  LDOP  is  more  robust  to  the  intra-class  variations  and  more  discriminative  to  the 
inter-class  similarities.  It  is  investigated  that  the  performance  of  LDOP  is  better  with  lower  radius  in  case  of  huge  pose 
variations and non-uniform illumination changes are present in the images. It is also found that the results are better with 
Chi-square distance. In future, the LDOP descriptor can be used to analyze the facial expressions. It can be extended for 
the facial analysis by considering the color information also.
