−13 M(cid:12)) black hole in the Galactic solar neighborhood has led to

Context. The recently claimed discovery of a massive (MBH
controversial discussions because it severely challenges our current view of stellar evolution.
Aims. A crucial aspect for the determination of the mass of the unseen black hole is the precise nature of its visible companion, the
B-type star LS V+22 25. Because stars of diﬀerent mass can exhibit B-type spectra during the course of their evolution, it is essential
to obtain a comprehensive picture of the star to unravel its nature and, thus, its mass.
Methods. To this end, we study the spectral energy distribution of LS V+22 25 and perform a quantitative spectroscopic analysis that
includes the determination of chemical abundances for He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe.
Results. Our analysis clearly shows that LS V+22 25 is not an ordinary main sequence B-type star. The derived abundance pattern
exhibits heavy imprints of the CNO bi-cycle of hydrogen burning, that is, He and N are strongly enriched at the expense of C and O.
Moreover, the elements Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe are systematically underabundant when compared to normal main-sequence B-type
stars. We suggest that LS V+22 25 is a stripped helium star and discuss two possible formation scenarios. Combining our photometric
and spectroscopic results with the Gaia parallax, we infer a stellar mass of 1.1 ± 0.5 M(cid:12). Based on the binary system’s mass function,
this yields a minimum mass of 2–3 M(cid:12) for the compact companion, which implies that it may not necessarily be a black hole but a
massive neutron- or main sequence star.
Conclusions. The star LS V+22 25 has become famous for possibly having a very massive black hole companion. However, a closer
look reveals that the star itself is a very intriguing object. Further investigations are necessary for complete characterization of this
object.

1. Introduction

Stellar black holes are hard to ﬁnd if they are not in interacting
binaries, that is, in X-ray binaries. Recently, Giesers et al. (2018)
found a single-lined binary in the globular cluster NGC 3201
consisting of a turn-oﬀ star orbited by a detached compact ob-
ject of minimum mass 4.36 ± 0.41 M(cid:12) in a highly eccentric orbit
with a period of 166.8 d. Because this minimum mass exceeds
the Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ limit, the discovery represents the ﬁrst
direct mass estimate of a detached black hole in a globular clus-
ter.

Most recently, Liu et al. (2019) reported the discovery of
the long-period (single-lined) spectroscopic binary system LB-1
(LS V+22 25). The visible component of this system is a bright
B-type star with a prominent and broad Hα emission line very
similar to a Be star. A ﬁt of TLUSTY B-star model spectra
lead to an eﬀective temperature Teﬀ = 18 104 ± 825 K, a sur-
face gravity of log(g) = 3.43 ± 0.15, and a metallicity consis-
tent with the solar value. Comparing these atmospheric parame-
ters with stellar evolution models of B-type main sequence (MS)
stars, the authors concluded that it is a young, massive star with
M = 8.2+0.9
−1.2 M(cid:12) and R = 9 ± 2 R(cid:12) located in the direction of the
Galactic anti-center at a distance of d = 4.23 ± 0.24 kpc.

The absorption lines of the star show radial-velocity vari-
ations with a period P = 78.9 ± 0.3 d. Fitting a binary or-
bit to the radial-velocity curve yielded a semi-amplitude K1 =

52.8 ± 0.7 km s−1 and a very small eccentricity e = 0.03 ± 0.01.
Adopting the above-mentioned mass for the visible B-star, the
mass of the companion would have to be higher than 6.3+0.4
−1.0 M(cid:12).
Since no spectral features of another star are detectable in the
spectra, Liu et al. (2019) concluded that the companion cannot
be a star, but instead has to be a black hole.

Based on the complex shape and substantial width (∼
240 km s−1) of the Hα emission line, the authors concluded that
it can only be a Keplerian disk. Since its radial velocity does
not follow the motion of the star, but shows a very small varia-
tion (Kα = 6.4 ± 0.8 km s−1) in anti-phase, the authors propose
that the disk is connected to the black hole companion. If so, the
orbital inclination of the binary would be very small (io = 15–
18◦) and the black hole extremely massive (MBH = 68+11
−13 M(cid:12)).
This result strongly challenges stellar evolution models, which
do not predict black holes of such high masses to be formed in
metal-rich environments (Liu et al. 2019; Eldridge et al. 2019;
Groh et al. 2019; Belczynski et al. 2019). The conclusion of Liu
et al. (2019) rests on two main pillars: ﬁrst, the B-star is a mas-
sive MS star; and second, the emission line is connected to the
compact companion. However the latter was severely questioned
by Abdul-Masih et al. (2019) and El-Badry & Quataert (2019)
who argue that the radial velocity variation of the emission line
is actually caused by the variability of the underlying absorption
line of the visible star and is therefore not related to the compact
companion. Because the Hα emission appears to be stationary, it

seems to remain as the only constraint on the mass M2 of the
compact companion, which is then a function of two unknowns,
namely the mass of the visible star M1 and the orbital incli-
nation io. The spectral analysis by Abdul-Masih et al. (2019)
revised the atmospheric parameters to Teﬀ = 13 500 ± 700 K,
log(g) = 3.3±0.3, and a projected rotational velocity of (cid:51) sin(i) =
7.5±4.0 km s−1. Those parameter values might still be consistent
with a massive B-type subgiant. However, the very low projected
rotational velocity – although it can be explained by seeing the
object relatively pole-on – is quite unusual for such an object
and could also be indicative of a diﬀerent nature. Indeed, some
evolved low-mass stars are known that can mimic normal B-
type stars spectroscopically (see, e.g., Hambly et al. 1997; Ram-
speck et al. 2001); these can be distinguished from massive B
stars by their slow rotation and chemical anomalies. Therefore,
in order to unravel the nature of the visible star and hence its
mass, we embarked on a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of
LS V+22 25. This analysis shows that this object is very likely
a rare stripped helium star in an evolutionary stage, at which
it simply mimics a massive MS star. This has important conse-
quences for the mass and potentially also for the nature of its
compact companion.

2. Analysis

2.1. Quantitative spectroscopic analysis

Our spectral investigation is based on the publicly available high-
resolution Keck/HIRES spectra described by Liu et al. (2019).
The analysis strategy and the applied models are explained in
detail in Irrgang et al. (2014). Brieﬂy, model computations fol-
low a so-called hybrid approach in which the structure of the
atmosphere is computed in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) with Atlas12 (Kurucz 1996) while departures from LTE
are accounted for by applying updated versions of Detail and
Surface (Giddings 1981; Butler & Giddings 1985). The Detail
code computes population numbers in non-LTE by numerically
solving the coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium
equations. The Surface code uses the resulting departure coef-
ﬁcients and more detailed line-broadening data to compute the
ﬁnal synthetic spectrum. All three codes have been recently up-
dated (Irrgang et al. 2018) by allowing for non-LTE eﬀects on
the atmospheric structure as well as by the implementation of
the occupation probability formalism (Hubeny et al. 1994) for
hydrogen and new Stark broadening tables for hydrogen (Trem-
blay & Bergeron 2009) and neutral helium (Beauchamp et al.
1997). Moreover, the concept of opacity sampling is consis-
tently used throughout all computational steps, which is impor-
tant when atmospheres with nonstandard chemical compositions
are analyzed. The best-ﬁtting model parameters are found by a
simultaneous ﬁt of all available spectra over their entire useful
spectral range; see Fig. A.1 for a comparison.

Our atmospheric parameters (Teﬀ = 12 720 ± 260 K, log(g) =
3.00 ± 0.08, see Table A.1) are, within error bars, consistent
with those of Abdul-Masih et al. (2019) but quite diﬀerent
from those of Liu et al. (2019). Furthermore, the low values
for the projected rotational velocity and for the microturbu-
lence, which were adopted or measured by Liu et al. (2019)
and Abdul-Masih et al. (2019), are more or less conﬁrmed here

Fig. 1. Diﬀerential abundance pattern of LS V+22 25 with respect to
the cosmic abundance standard by Nieva & Przybilla (2012) in terms
of fractional particle numbers (upper panel) and mass fractions (lower
panel). Solar abundances by Asplund et al. (2009) are used for Al, S,
and Ar because cosmic abundances are not available for these elements.
The error bars are the square roots of the quadratic sums of all given in-
dividual 1σ uncertainties. The gray-shaded area marks elements whose
abundances show signatures of hydrogen burning via the CNO bi-cycle.
To get rid of this eﬀect, the invariant sum of the bi-cycle-catalysts C, N,
and O (“CNO”) is also plotted. The abundance pattern of metals heavier
than oxygen is nonstandard as well.

((cid:51) sin(i) = 8.7 ± 0.2 km s−1, ξ ≤ 0.1 km s−1). While those val-
ues are already quite uncommon for a MS B-type star, the most
striking result is revealed by the abundance analysis; see Fig. 1.
The star shows an overwhelming signature of material that is
processed by hydrogen burning via the CNO bi-cycle, namely
extremely strong enrichment in helium and nitrogen at the ex-
pense of carbon and oxygen. Additionally, the heavier chemical
elements also exhibit pronounced peculiarities. Magnesium and
aluminum are considerably depleted while silicon, sulfur, argon,
and iron are closer to “standard” values, but still systematically
depleted in terms of mass fractions1. Atomic diﬀusion processes
could possibly explain such an abundance pattern, in particular
because the observed helium lines show an unusual shape: the
observed line wings are too strong while the line cores are too
weak (see Fig. A.2). This could be the signature of vertical strat-
iﬁcation due to diﬀusion in the atmosphere, as observed in the
spectra of some blue horizontal branch and hot subdwarf B stars
(sdBs, see Schneider et al. 2018 and references therein). How-
ever, diﬀusion is unlikely to act in a star with such low gravity
(log(g) = 3.00). Therefore, it is more plausible to attribute the
mismatch of the helium lines to disk emission ﬁlling the line
cores, which is the same eﬀect that is observed for the hydrogen
Balmer lines (Liu et al. 2019). However, much higher tempera-
tures would be required to see this eﬀect also in helium. An im-

1 We focus here on mass instead of number fractions because the for-
mer are invariant against stellar evolution, i.e., they do not change when
hydrogen is converted to helium. Consequently, they are the natural
measure for chemical peculiarities when stellar evolution is at play.

proved understanding of the disk structure is needed to solve this
open question. For the time being, we adopt rather conservative
systematic uncertainties on temperature and gravity to compen-
sate for this source of uncertainty.

2.2. Analysis of the spectral energy distribution

To cross-check our spectroscopic results and to obtain a more
comprehensive picture of LS V+22 25, we also ﬁtted its spec-
tral energy distribution using a two-component model consist-
ing of a stellar spectrum plus a blackbody component. The latter
was included to empirically account for the observed infrared
excess, which might be associated with the disk structure. While
the derived blackbody temperature (Tbb = 1140+120
−100 K) indicates
that this thermal source is much cooler than the stellar compo-
nent, we do not want to overinterpret this result given that the
disk is certainly much more complex than a simple blackbody.
Nevertheless, by including this component, we are able to re-
produce the entire spectral energy distribution from the near-
ultraviolet to the far-infrared (see Fig. A.3) yielding results (see
Table A.2) that are consistent with spectroscopy. Another no-
table outcome of this exercise is an estimate for the star’s an-
gular diameter and for the interstellar reddening in its line of
sight. Using the extinction law by Fitzpatrick (1999), we ob-
tain an extinction coeﬃcient RV = 3.64+0.22
−0.20 and a color excess
E(B − V) = 0.397 ± 0.024 mag. Those values become important
below, when the reliability of the Gaia parallax is discussed.

3. The nature of LS V+22 25 and its unseen

companion

3.1. B-type stars: not only a MS phenomenon
B-type spectra can be observed for stars of very diﬀerent evolu-
tionary stages. The most common ones are young, massive MS
stars. However, the much less massive (∼ 0.47 M(cid:12)) and smaller
(∼ 0.1–0.3 R(cid:12)) sdBs show relatively similar spectra. Most of
them are likely core helium-burning stars located on or some-
what evolved away from the horizontal branch (Dorman et al.
1993; Han et al. 2002). However, in addition, even less massive
(∼ 0.2–0.47 M(cid:12)) helium stars, which are direct progenitors of
helium white dwarfs (He-WDs) can show B-type spectra for a
period of time (∼ 106–107 yr; Driebe et al. 1998; Althaus et al.
2013; Istrate et al. 2014) during their evolution (e.g. Heber et al.
2003; Latour et al. 2016). Those objects are closely related to
the cooler and less massive extremely low-mass white dwarfs,
which have been discovered in substantial numbers in recent
years (Brown et al. 2016; Pelisoli & Vos 2019).

Most low-mass B-type stars are much less luminous than
their MS counterparts and their higher surface gravities lead to
a stronger broadening of the spectral lines. Moreover, the major-
ity of them also show chemical peculiarities in their atmospheres
due to earlier mixing episodes, diﬀusion, isotopic anomalies, or
stratiﬁcation (e.g., O’Toole & Heber 2006; Geier 2013; Schnei-
der et al. 2018). Finally, low-mass B-type stars are usually intrin-
sically very slow rotators (Geier & Heber 2012). Consequently,
such objects can in general be easily distinguished from MS
stars.

3.2. Helium stars

One common feature of all sdB types is that they are helium
stars, which is diﬃcult to explain using evolutionary scenarios
involving only single stars. The helium core of a red giant has to

be stripped either well before or at the moment at which helium-
burning starts in the core. The stripping is done either by stable
Roche lobe overﬂow (RLOF) to a companion star or via unstable
common-envelope ejection (Han et al. 2002; Han et al. 2003).
Depending on the mass-transfer mechanism, very short-period
post-common-envelope systems consisting of sdBs with small
companions (P ∼ 0.05–30 d, e.g., Kupfer et al. 2015; Schaﬀen-
roth et al. 2019) or wide post-RLOF systems (P ∼ 300–1200 d,
Vos et al. 2013) are formed.

Only a few candidates for core helium-burning sdB stars
have been proposed to have neutron star or black hole compan-
ions (Geier et al. 2010), but an extended survey for such ob-
jects in close orbits could not conﬁrm their existence (Geier et al.
2011; Geier et al. 2015). However, at least one pre-He-WD with
a neutron star companion is known (Kaplan et al. 2013) and the
more evolved He-WDs are regularly detected as visible compan-
ions of neutron stars.

Stripped helium stars with masses higher than ∼ 0.47 M(cid:12) are
also predicted by binary evolution models (Götberg et al. 2018).
However, these are much rarer and only a few of them have been
observed so far, such as for example HD 49798 (Mereghetti et al.
2009). This enigmatic X-ray binary subdwarf O star (sdO) may
be considered as the prototype for a stripped helium star (Brooks
et al. 2017). Although HD 49798 has been assigned the spec-
tral type sdO, it is unique among the hot subdwarfs because
it is considerably more massive and luminous. It is a single-
lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 1.5 d, which
was discovered as a soft X-ray source by the ROSAT satellite.
The presence of X-rays indicates that a compact object accretes
from the stellar wind. X-ray eclipses allowed dynamical mea-
surement of the masses of the two binary components, reveal-
ing that HD 49798 is much more massive (1.5 M(cid:12)) than normal
hot sudwarfs stars (∼ 0.47 M(cid:12)) and that its companion is either
a white dwarf or a neutron star of 1.28 ± 0.05 M(cid:12). HD 49798
has been revisited recently, using both spectroscopy and evolu-
tionary modeling. Krtiˇcka et al. (2019) carried out a quantitative
spectral analysis of optical and ultraviolet spectra to derive the
abundance pattern. Similar to LS V+22 25, the atmospheric he-
lium is strongly enriched and the CNO pattern is obvious. The
abundances of heavier elements are also nonstandard: mostly
overabundant with respect to the Sun. Brooks et al. (2017) com-
puted the evolution of such a binary and were able to explain the
observed abundances in helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen as
a result of stripping of the envelope of a 7 M(cid:12) star by its compact
companion.

3.3. LS V+22 25: An intermediate-mass stripped helium

star?

To constrain the mass, radius, and luminosity of LS V+22 25,
we make use of its angular diameter, surface gravity, and paral-
lax from Gaia ((cid:36) = 0.4403 ± 0.0856 mas), which places the star
much closer than expected for a massive B-star. Liu et al. (2019)
argued that the Gaia measurement could be erroneous because
of the orbital motion of the star. However, the Gaia quality ﬂags
indicate that the astrometric solution is well-behaved: The uncer-
tainty is smaller than 20%, 100 out of 103 astrometric observa-
tions are marked as good, the “renormalized unit weight error”
(RUWE = 0.95, see Lindegren 2018) is perfectly acceptable,
and possibly problematic correlations between position and par-
allax discussed by Liu et al. (2019) were shown to simply be the
result of Gaia’s scanning pattern (Eldridge et al. 2019). More-
over, and contrary to Liu et al. (2019), the combination of our
derived value for interstellar reddening towards the line-of-sight

A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper

of LS V+22 25 with three-dimensional dust maps by Green et al.
(2019) yields a distance estimate that is fully consistent with the
parallactic distance; see Fig. A.4. Assuming the Gaia parallax to
be correct, we can combine it with the photometrically derived
angular diameter and the surface gravity from spectroscopy to
determine the radius, mass, and luminosity of LS V+22 25 (see
Table A.2), yielding R1 = 5.5 ± 1.1 R(cid:12), M1 = 1.1 ± 0.5 M(cid:12), and
log(L1/L(cid:12)) = 2.95±0.19. If LS V+2 25 was indeed a stripped he-
lium star of that mass, it should be observed as a helium-rich sdO
star (Götberg et al. 2018). However, and as already mentioned
by Liu et al. (2019), the star could be caught in the short-period
post-stripping transition phase during which it evolves on the
Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale, which is of the order of 104 yr. The
unseen companion could then have a mass as low as 2.5+0.4
−0.5 M(cid:12)
and might therefore be either a black hole, a (massive) neutron
star, or even a relatively unevolved low-mass MS star that is
too faint to be detected (see Fig. A.5). For orbital inclinations
smaller than 45◦, the mass of the compact companion would ex-
ceed 5.0+0.6
−0.7 M(cid:12) and therefore reach values that are quite typical
for known black holes in X-ray binaries.

If this were the correct scenario, we would see a stripped
star in a very short-lived relaxation phase just after the stripping
event. The presence of a disk around the companion consisting
of the remnants of the envelope of the red-giant progenitor might
then be the relic of mass transfer. Also, the almost perfectly cir-
cular orbit of the binary would ﬁt to a previous episode of mass
transfer which circularized the rather wide orbit.

3.4. LS V+22 25: A low-mass stripped pre-He-WD?

As outlined by Liu et al. (2019), the orbital motion in the binary
system may have a non-negligible impact on the Gaia measure-
ments. Based on the orbital parameters by Liu et al. (2019), the
projected semimajor axis of the binary system is

a1 sin(io) = 1
2π

(1 − e2)1/2K1P = 0.383 ± 0.006 AU .

(2)

Depending on the orientation of the orbital plane (e.g., the orbital
inclination) and the scanning pattern of Gaia (e.g., the number of
visits and their sampling of the binary orbit), this intrinsic binary
motion may be comparable to Earth’s movement of 1 AU, and
thus large enough to disturb the parallax measurement without
producing a strong signal in the quality ﬂags. If we thus allow
LS V+22 25 to be even closer than suggested by the parallax and
the reddening maps, another scenario may be considered, which
involves a low-mass stripped pre-He-WD.

LS V+22 25 would not be the ﬁrst pre-He-WD mimicking a
MS B-type star. Already decades ago, a similar case was dis-
cussed (Luyten 1965). The star HZ 22 (also known as UX CVn)
resembled an early-type MS star. However, variations in the ra-
dial velocity and in the light curve due to ellipsoidal deforma-
tion showed that it must be a single-lined spectroscopic binary
system with a massive white dwarf companion. The resulting or-
bital period of about half a day (Young et al. 1972) was too short
for the system to contain a normal MS B-star. Based on evo-
lutionary models, HZ 22 was identiﬁed as a helium-core object
of ∼ 0.39 M(cid:12) (Trimble 1973; Schönberner 1978). Shimanskii
(2002) performed a detailed quantitative abundance analysis and
found that helium, carbon, and iron are depleted, which is con-
sistent with an old evolved star, that is, with the interpretation
that this object is a proto-helium-core white dwarf.

Figure A.6 shows a (Teﬀ, log(g)) diagram with MS evolution-
ary tracks (Ekström et al. 2012) as well as pre-He-WD tracks

Article number, page 4 of 10

(Driebe et al. 1998). Therein, tracks for very low-mass pre-He-
WDs can be clearly seen to overlap with the MS tracks of mas-
sive B-type stars. LS V+22 25 is located close to tracks with
masses of ∼ 0.315 M(cid:12) and might be in a slightly earlier evo-
lutionary phase than the prototype HZ 22, which is hotter and
more compact. The evolutionary timescale of such a contracting
object until it crosses the zero-age main sequence is about 105 yr
(Driebe et al. 1998). The respective stellar radius would still be
as large as ∼ 2.6 R(cid:12). The minimum mass of the compact com-
panion could be as low as 1.69 ± 0.04 M(cid:12), which would be con-
sistent with a neutron star or a black hole. A low-mass MS com-
panion is less likely in this scenario because it would probably be
luminous enough to leave imprints in the observed spectrum (see
Fig. A.5), and these are not seen in the currently available data.
For orbital inclinations smaller than 45◦, the mass of the com-
pact companion would exceed 3.95+0.10
−0.09 M(cid:12) which would rule
out a neutron star companion. However, the spectroscopic dis-
tance of such a pre-He-WD would then be just 1.21 ± 0.12 kpc,
that is, about half the Gaia and reddening distances.

4. Summary
We carried out a quantitative spectral analysis of LS V+22 25
and derive an eﬀective temperature and a surface gravity that
are both lower than previously reported. The inferred abundance
pattern is characterized by the signature of hydrogen burning via
the CNO bi-cycle. Moreover, heavier elements (magnesium, alu-
minum, silicon, sulfur, argon, and iron) deviate more or less from
values expected for normal B-type MS stars. We also ﬁnd a good
ﬁt of the spectral energy distribution based on a stellar model
plus a blackbody component that was used as a simple proxy
for the circumstellar disk. Making use of the Gaia parallax, the
spectrophotometric angular diameter, and the spectroscopic sur-
face gravity, we derive a stellar mass of 1.1 ± 0.5 M(cid:12), which is
much lower than that of a B subgiant. Together with the peculiar
abundance pattern, this suggests that LS V+22 25 is not a normal
MS B-type star but rather a stripped helium star.

Motivated by two prototypical low-mass hot stars, the sdO
X-ray binary HD 49798 and the B + WD binary HZ 22, we con-
sidered two classes of stripped helium stars. The former scenario
envisages envelope stripping of a massive star by a compact
companion while the latter assumes that a low- to intermediate-
mass red giant is stripped before the onset of the helium ﬂash,
leaving behind an inert helium star of low mass (< 0.5 M(cid:12)). We
consider the latter scenario unlikely because it is at variance with
the distance determined from parallax and reddening. Moreover,
the expected lifetimes are of the order of 105 to 106 years, which
might be too long to sustain the observed disk if it is indeed
circumbinary as suggested by El-Badry & Quataert (2019). The
intermediate-mass scenario on the other hand is consistent with
the distance estimates as well as with a young age as indicated
by the star’s position in the Perseus spiral arm (see Fig. A.7),
but would be in a rather short-lived evolutionary phase (104 yr),
which might explain the presence of the circumstellar disk, that
is, as a relic of the mass transfer. The abundances derived here
will serve as crucial constraints for tailored evolutionary models.
Our mass estimate for LS V+22 25 is signiﬁcantly smaller
than that proposed by Liu et al. (2019). Consequently, for a wide
range of orbital inclinations, the mass of the compact companion
is considerably lower than the claimed value of MBH = 68+11
−13 M(cid:12)
and therefore not in conﬂict with the general picture of stellar
evolution in our Galaxy. For inclinations close to 90◦, the com-
pact companion might not even be a black hole but a neutron star
or a relatively unevolved low-mass MS star.

A. Irrgang et al.: A stripped helium star in the potential black hole binary LB-1

A possible progenitor system of LS V+22 25 has already
been discovered recently: 2MASS J05215658+4359220 consists
of a bright, rapidly rotating red giant star orbited by a noninter-
acting compact companion with a mass of 3.3+2.8
−0.7 M(cid:12), which is
probably a neutron star or a black hole (Thompson et al. 2019).
Just like LS V+22 25, the orbit is almost circular, but the most
stunning similarity is the orbital period of ∼ 83 d. The object
2MASS J05215658+4359220 likely shows ellipsoidal variations
and is close to ﬁlling its Roche lobe. This red giant will soon get
stripped by the compact companion and might evolve to a con-
ﬁguration that resembles that of LS V+22 25.

Fig. A.1. Comparison of best-ﬁtting model spectrum (red line) with re-normalized observation (black line; HIRES spectrum taken on December
12, 2017). Light colors mark regions that have been excluded from ﬁtting, e.g., due to data reduction artifacts or the presence of features that are
not properly included in our models such as disk emission in the cores of the hydrogen and helium lines or possible stratiﬁcation eﬀects in the
helium lines. Residuals χ are shown as well.

Notes. The abundance n(x) is either given as a fractional particle number (upper three rows) or a mass fraction (lower three rows) of species x with
respect to all elements. Statistical uncertainties (“Stat.”) are 1σ conﬁdence limits based on χ2 statistics. Systematic uncertainties (“Sys.”) cover
only the eﬀects induced by additional variations of 2% in Teﬀ and 0.08 in log(g) and are formally taken to be 1σ conﬁdence limits (see Irrgang
et al. 2014 for details).

24, 2017) with special focus on the broad He i lines 4387.93 Å (left panel) and 4471.48 Å (right panel). Light colors mark regions that have been
excluded from ﬁtting. Residuals χ are shown as well. The resulting residual pattern, namely that the observed wings are too strong while the
observed cores are too weak, could be indicative of vertical stratiﬁcation; see, e.g., Schneider et al. (2018) for details, or disk emission ﬁlling the
line cores.

Fig. A.3. Comparison of synthetic and observed photometry: The top panel shows the spectral energy distribution. The colored data points are
ﬁlter-averaged ﬂuxes which were converted from observed magnitudes (the respective ﬁlter widths are indicated by the dashed horizontal lines),
while the gray solid line represents the best-ﬁtting model, i.e., it is based on the parameters from Table A.2, degraded to a spectral resolution of
6 Å. The individual contributions of the stellar (light blue) and blackbody (light red) component are shown as well. The panels at the bottom and on
the side show the residuals χ, i.e., the diﬀerence between synthetic and observed data divided by the corresponding uncertainties, for magnitudes
and colors, respectively. The photometric systems have the following color code: Johnson-Cousins (blue; Mermilliod 2006; Henden et al. 2015;
calibration from Bessell & Murphy 2012); SDSS (golden; Henden et al. 2015); Gaia (cyan; Evans et al. 2018 with corrections and calibrations
from Maíz Apellániz & Weiler 2018); 2MASS (red; Skrutskie et al. 2006); WISE (magenta; Cutri & et al. 2014).

Fig. A.5. Mass of the secondary component as a function of the orbital inclination io: primary masses M1 of 1.1 ± 0.5 M(cid:12) (left panel; see Table A.2)
and 0.315 ± 0.015 M(cid:12) (right panel; see Fig. A.6) are used to numerically solve Eq. (1) for M2. The width of the gray shaded region reﬂects
all 1σ-uncertainties. The y-axis on the right-hand-side shows the luminosity of a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) star with mass M2 based on
evolutionary tracks for nonrotating stars of solar metallicity (Ekström et al. 2012). The light-blue shaded horizontal bar represents the inferred
luminosity of the visible B-type primary, log(L1/L(cid:12)). For high orbital inclinations, a relatively unevolved low-mass MS companion could be
outshined by its primary by more than one (right panel) to almost two (left panel) orders of magnitude, which could be faint enough to avoid
imprints in the observed spectrum.

Fig. A.6. Position of LS V+22 25 (blue error bars) in the (Teﬀ, log(g)) diagram: the black solid lines are pre-He-WD tracks from Driebe et al.

solar metallicity (gray dashed lines; Ekström et al. 2012), and the corresponding ZAMS are shown for reference.

Fig. A.7. Three-dimensional orbit of LS V+22 25 in a Galactic Cartesian coordinate system in which the Galactic center (marked by a black +) lies
at the origin, the Sun (marked by a black (cid:12)) is located on the negative x-axis, and the z-axis points to the Galactic north pole. The nine trajectories
(red lines; arrows indicate the star’s current position) illustrate the eﬀects of uncertainties in the parallax and proper motions from Gaia, and in the
systemic radial velocity from Liu et al. (2019). These were computed back in time for 200 Myr using a standard three-component, axisymmetric
model for the Galactic gravitational potential (see Irrgang et al. 2013 for details on the Milky Way mass model and on the orbit computations).
The shape of the orbit (prograde, almost circular, small vertical oscillations) is typical for a thin-disk star (see, e.g., Pauli et al. 2006 for details on
the properties of diﬀerent kinematic groups). The thick blue solid lines schematically represent the loci of the spiral arms based on the polynomial
logarithmic arm model of Hou & Han (2014). Interestingly, the current position of the star seems to be aligned with the Perseus spiral arm, which
could be a possible sign of youth.
