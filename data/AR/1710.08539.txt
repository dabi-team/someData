ABSTRACT
We have used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain
a series of 4 far ultraviolet (FUV, 915-2148 ˚A) spectroscopic observations of the prototypical dwarf
nova U Geminorum during its cooling following a two-week outburst. Our FUV spectral analysis of
the data indicates that the white dwarf (WD) cools from a temperature of ∼ 41, 500 K, 15 days after
the peak of the outburst, to ∼ 36, 250 K, 56 days after the peak of the outburst, assuming a massive
WD (log(g) = 8.8) and a distance of 100.4 ± 3.7 pc. These results are self-consistent with a ∼ 1.1M⊙
WD with a 5, 000 ± 200 km radius. The spectra show absorption lines of H i, He ii, C ii iii iv, N iii iv,
O vi, S iv, Si ii iii iv, Al iii, Ar iii, and Fe ii, but no emission features. We ﬁnd supra-solar abundances
of nitrogen conﬁrming the anomalous high N/C ratio. The FUV lightcurve reveals a ±5% modulation
with the orbital phase, showing dips near phase 0.25 and ∼0.75, where the spectra exhibit an increase
in the depth of some absorption lines and in particular strong absorption lines from Si ii, Al iii, and
Ar iii. The phase dependence we observe is consistent with material overﬂowing the disk rim at the
hot spot, reaching a maximum elevation near phase 0.75, falling back at smaller radii near phase 0.5
where it bounces oﬀ the disk surface and again rising above the disk near phase ∼0.25. There is a
large scatter in the absorption lines’ velocities, especially for the silicon lines, while the carbon lines
seem to match more closely the orbital velocity of the WD. This indicates that many absorption lines
are aﬀected by- or form in- the overﬂowing stream material veiling the WD, making the analysis of
the WD spectra more diﬃcult.

(i.e. DNe with period P > 3 hrs). For that reason, it
has been extensively studied, observed numerous time in
the X-ray (e.g. Mason et al. 1988; Szkody et al. 1996),
extreme ultraviolet (e.g. Long et al. 1996), ultraviolet
(e.g. Long et al. 1993), optical (e.g. Zhang and Robinson
1987; Unda-Sanzana et al. 2006; Echevarr´ıa et al. 2007),
and infrared (e.g. Panek & Eaton 1982), and it has even
been modeled using three-dimensional hydrodynamics
(e.g. Kunze et al. 2001) as well as within the context
of the restricted three-body problem (e.g. Smak 2001).
Consequently, we restrict ourselves here below to sum-
marizing only the characteristics of the system that are
directly relevant to the present work with a limited num-
ber of references (as the complete list is extensive).

1. INTRODUCTION: U GEM - THE
PROTOTYPICAL DWARF NOVA

Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) are semi-detached inter-
acting binaries in which a white dwarf (WD) accretes
matter from a Roche lobe-ﬁlling late type companion.
When the WD has a weak or negligible magnetic ﬁeld,
the matter is accreted by means of a disk in which it
dissipates its gravitational potential energy. The most
common class of CVs are the dwarf novae (DNe), found
mostly in a state of low accretion, when the disk is dim
and the WD dominates in the ultraviolet (UV) band.
Every few weeks to months, DNe undergo semi-regular
outbursts (lasting days to weeks) in which the system
brightens by 3-5 visual magnitudes, as the mass transfer
rate increases due to a thermal instability in the disk.
During outbursts, the accretion disk totally dominates
the systems in the UV and optical bands.

XIV/A

In December 1855 the dwarf novae U Gem became the
ﬁrst CV to be discovered (Hind 1856), and as such it also
became the prototypical “UG” sub-type of dwarf novae

U Gem has a period of 0.1769061911 day (∼ 4
hr 15 min, Marsh et al. 1990; Echevarr´ıa et al. 2007;
Dai & Qian 2009)), and a mass ratio q = 0.35 ±
0.05 (Long & Gilliland 1999; Echevarr´ıa et al. 2007) with
a WD mass Mwd ∼ 1.1 − 1.2M⊙ (Sion et al. 1998;
It has distance of 100.4 ±

(Kraft 1962; Krzeminski 1965) in which the disk un-
dergoes partial eclipses (around phase 0.0 ± 0.1) by
the donor, the hot spot undergoes full eclipses (just
after phase 0.0) by the donor, while the WD is
never eclipsed (Smak 1971; Warner and Nather 1971;
Marsh et al. 1990; Echevarr´ıa et al. 2007). For this to
happen with a mass ratio q ∼ 0.35, the inclination has
to be in the range 62◦ − 74◦ (Long & Gilliland 1999;
Long et al. 2006), and the value derived in the litterature
is between i = 67◦ and i = 72◦ (Long & Gilliland 1999;
Long et al. 2006; Smak 2001; Unda-Sanzana et al. 2006),
conﬁrming the early estimate by Zhang and Robinson
(1987) of i = 69.7◦ ± 0.7◦. The system parameters are
listed in Table 1 together with their references.

U Gem goes into outburst every ∼118 days, bright-
ening from mv = 14.9 to mv = 8.2 for an average
outburst time of ≈ 12 days (Szkody and Mattei 1984;
Ritter & Kolb 2003). However, the system actually ex-
hibits two kinds of outbursts: narrow outbursts lasting
about a week (∼ 4 − 7 days), and wide outbursts last-
ing about two weeks (∼ 14 days, Sion et al. 1998). Ul-
traviolet spectroscopic observations obtained during a
wide outburst are consistent with a steady state disk
with a mass accretion rate ranging from ˙M = 2 ×
10−9M⊙/yr (Sion et al. 1997) to ˙M = 7−8×10−9M⊙/yr
(Panek & Holm 1984; Froning et al. 2001). During the
decline from outburst the mass accretion rates decreases
( ˙M = 6 × 10−10M⊙/yr, see Sion et al. 1997), and even-
tually the metal-enriched hot WD dominates the spec-
trum. A second component appears on the WD, pos-
sibly an optically thick hot boundary layer or an “ac-
cretion belt” (Long et al. 1993),
improving the model
ﬁt in the shorter wavelengths of Far Ultraviolet Spec-
troscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectra of U Gem (< 960˚A ,
Froning et al. 2001).

In quiescence, shortly after outburst, the WD has
a temperature still above 40,000 K (Long et al. 2006),
and cools to ∼ 30, 000 K within several months
(Kiplinger et al. 1991; Long et al. 1994, 1995). The
length of the quiescence dictates the post-outburst tem-
perature reached, which has occasionally been observed
to be anomalously low (Sion et al. 1998) following a very
long quiescence period. The exact WD temperature de-
rived from the data depends also on the WD eﬀective
surface gravity log(g) assumed in the modeling.

Nonsolar metal abundances attributed to the WD pho-
tosphere have been found in the studies of U Gem
(Sion et al. 1998; Long & Gilliland 1999; Froning et al.
2001), revealing evidence of CNO processing, namely
sub-solar carbon and silicon abundances and supra-
solar nitrogen abundance. Sub-solar aluminum has also
been recorded (Long & Gilliland 1999). However, phase-
dependent absorption has been shown to be responsible
for the time-variable absorption seen in the FUV, which
complicates the analysis of the WD spectra (Long et al.
2006).

While U Gem was observed previously with HST in
the UV band with the HST/Goddard High-Resolution
Spectrograph (GHRS, Sion et al. 1998; Long & Gilliland
1999), we obtained HST/COS FUV observations of U
Gem extending down the Lyman limit (915-2148 ˚A).
The only previous observations covering the Lyman re-
gion were made with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope
(HUT) (Long et al. 1993) and FUSE (Froning et al.
2001; Long et al. 2006).

We present here the FUV spectral analysis of 4 HST
COS spectra obtained following a two-week outburst.
The data obtained at the ﬁrst epoch were purposedly
collected to span a complete binary orbit (∼ 4 hours),
while the data obtained at the remaining three epochs
were each collected for only a quarter of an orbit. In this
manner we were able to analyze the data to detect any
variation as a function of the orbital phase as well as a
function of the time passed since outburst. In the next
section we describe the observations and data, in section
3 we present and discuss the results from our spectral
analysis, we then conclude in section 4 with a summary.

2. THE HST/COS SPECTRA

2.1. Observations

U Gem went into an outburst on November 29, 2013,
for about 15 days, increasing its brightness from ∼ 14.2
to ∼ 9.3. The outburst, shown in Fig.1, was fairly nor-
mal for a “wide” outburst, however, it followed a quies-
cence period of only 69 days (the previous outburst was
a short 7-day outburst that started on September 14).
The HST/COS observations of U Gem were taken on
December 20 & 26, 2012, and on January 7 & 30, 2013,
following the wide November outburst.

The time at which the observations were taken is

marked on Fig.1 with vertical arrows pointing down. The
observation log is given in Table 2.

COS was set up in the FUV conﬁguration with the
G140L grating centered at 1280 ˚A in time tag mode. The
data were collected through the primary science aperture
(PSA) of 2.5 arcsec diameter. This conﬁguration pro-
duces two spectral segments covering ∼915-1193 ˚A and
∼1266-1248 ˚A, with a gap between 1193 ˚A and 1266 ˚A.
While the resulting spectrum covers the Lyman series
down to its cut-oﬀ, it does not cover the Lα region.

The data were processed with CALCOS version 3.1.8
through the pipeline which produces for each HST or-
bit 4 sub-exposures generated by shifting the position
of the spectrum on the detector by 20 ˚A each time.
This strategy is to reduce detector eﬀects. It is left to
the observer to compare the 4 sub-exposures and iden-
tify all the detector artifacts which appear on all sub-
exposures but with a shift of 20 ˚A from sub-exposure
to sub-exposure. The ﬁrst epoch data are covering 3
HST orbits and consist of 12 sub-exposures, the remain-
ing data obtained at epochs 2, 3 and 4 all consist of one
HST orbit each, made of 4 sub-exposures each. The sec-
ond sub-exposure of epoch #2 was lost due to the COS
light path being blocked during that exposure. We there-
fore collected a total of 23 sub-exposures each consisting
of two spectral segments with a gap in the Lα region.

Figure 2. A sub-exposure (from a single detector po-
sition) is presented here to show the poor signal in the
very short and very long wavelengths (sub-exposure #1
of (HST) orbit #2 obtained at epoch #1). In this spec-
trum the gap occurs between 1195 ˚A and 1318 ˚A , though
some detector edge eﬀects aﬀect the spectrum and makes
the actual gap wider. We discard the region > 2000 ˚A,
however, it is likely that the spectrum is aﬀected at even
shorter wavelengths (∼ 1900 ˚A).

For the ﬁrst orbit of epoch #1, and for the single orbit
of epoch # 2, 3, and 4, the eﬀective good exposure time
of each sub-exposure is a little more than ∼200 sec. For
the second and third orbits of epoch #1 the exposure
time for each sub-exposure is ∼ 600 sec.
In Fig.3 we
display the 23 spectra extracted from the sub-exposures
in the Si iv doublet (∼ 1400 ˚A) region to show the quality
of the spectra.

Due to the gap between the two segments of the detec-
tor and the 20 ˚A shift in the detector position for each of
the 4 sub-exposures, and due to detector artifacts (espe-
cially near its edges), the spectra are not reliable beyond
the C iii (1175) absorption lines, nor below ∼1300 ˚A. In
Fig.4 we illustrate how the detector edges (and gain sag)
aﬀect some of the spectral regions, and we explain how
we identify these artifacts that need to be discarded. For
this reason the spectral lines analysis is carried out on
the individual sub-exposures, which have a much lower
S/N than the combined spectrum.

were obtained at 4 epochs, covering 6 HST orbits as shown on the right. Each HST orbit generated 4 sub-exposures
(one for each of the 4 COS detector position) totaling 23 spectra (sub-exposure 2 of the second epoch contains no
data). The sub-exposures of the 2nd and 3rd orbits obtained at the ﬁrst epoch have an exposure time of ∼600 s each,
the remaining sub-exposures have an exposure of only ∼200 s each. The diﬀerence in the S/N can be seen in the

Figure 4. Each COS exposure is made of 4 sub-exposures that are generated by shifting the position of the spectrum
on the detector by 20 ˚A. This strategy allows to identify and compensate for detector artifacts by inspecting the 4
sub-exposures simultaneously. We display here the ﬁrst HST/COS observations sub-exposures vertically shifted for
clarity. Detector artifacts repeat themselves at 20 ˚A intervals and are easily found by looking for similar pattern shifted
by 20 ˚A from sub-exposure to sub-exposure. In the present case, for illustration, we isolate two such artifacts within
the circle and within the ellipse. Unfortunately the detector artifacts are stronger toward the edges of the detectors
which render the eﬀective detector gap larger than it actually is.

 
FUV Spectroscopy of U Gem

Because of the sub-exposure spectra having a diﬀerent
wavelength coverage, the C iii (1175) and N iii (1183)
absorption lines are only present in 6 sub-exposures.

2.2. The FUV Absorption Lines

Figure 5. The short wavelength region of the COS G140L
spectrum of U Gem, exposure LC1U01010 (epoch # 1),
is shown here for line identiﬁcations. The Hydrogen Ly-
man series lines are marked underneath the panels to-
gether with the He ii Balmer lines n = 5 at 1084.94 ˚A
and n = 7 at 992.36 ˚A. The spectrum is characterized by
the broad wings of the hydrogen Lyman series in absorp-
tion as well as broad absorption lines from low and high
ionization species. The carbon, silicon, sulphur, and ni-
trogen lines are typical to accreting WD stars, though the
nitrogen lines seems to be stronger than usual. The N iv
and O vi doublet possibly form in a hot (∼ 80, 000 K)
medium veiling the WD. The spectrum does not show
any ISM absorption lines and clearly reveals a moder-
ately hot accreting WD.

In this subsection we present the absorption lines de-
tected in the COS spectrum of U Gem. While many
lines can be easily identiﬁed, some other lines were iden-
tiﬁed during our spectral analysis and the procedure we
follow for line identiﬁcations is described in the analysis
section. We did not detect any emission features in the
COS spectrum of U Gem.

During quiescence we expect the WD to dominate the
FUV and, therefore, we expect the COS spectrum to ex-
hibit absorption lines from a moderately hot (∼30,0000-
40,000 K) WD, namely the hydrogen Lyman lines, he-
lium Balmer lines, low ionization species lines, as well
as possibly some higher ionization species lines. The in-
dividual sub-exposure spectra are very noisy, especially
below 1000 ˚A, and we consequently ﬁrst proceed by com-
bining together the sub-exposures of the ﬁrst epoch to
clearly display the absorption lines and identify them be-
low 1080 ˚A. For clarity the resulting epoch #1 spectrum

is

The COS spectrum (as

shown in the long wavelength
region, but on a diﬀerent vertical scale. The spectrum
reveals the usual absorption lines seen the photospheres
of accreting WDs, such as the Si iii (1300), C ii (1335),
silicon doublet (∼1400), C iv (1550) and He ii (1638).
The spectrum exhibits some unusually strong Ar iii
(∼1669) and Al iii lines (1353, 1855, & 1863). The
absorption features marked with the ⊕ symbol are
detector artifacts (gain sag in regions illuminated by
airglow).
In the longer wavelengths (lower panel), the
spectrum becomes extremely noisy and for that reason
we discard the region > 2000 ˚A.

is presented in two ﬁgures. The actual spectral analysis
is carried out on the sub-exposures rather than on the
combined spectrum.

In Fig.5 we display the short wavelength segment which
has a similar spectral range to FUSE spectra. The hy-
drogen Lyβ absorption line is the main broad feature
dominating the spectrum in the middle panel. The hy-
drogen Lyγ and Lyδ absorption features are also clearly
apparent, but the higher orders of the series are not. The
spectrum is marked by broad absorption features usually
detected in the FUSE spectra of CV WDs (Godon et al.
2012) from carbon (C iii 977, 1175), nitrogen (N iii 990,
1085, 1184), silicon (Si iii 1110, 1144; Si iv 1167, 1122,
1128), and sulphur (S iv 1063, 1073). In addition, some
higher ionization species absorption lines appearing only
at higher temperature (T ∼ 80, 000 K) are also seen, N iv
(923) and the O vi doublet (1032, 1038), an indication
that a hot absorbing medium is in front of the WD. The
S vi (933, 944) and P v (1118, 1128) absorption lines, pre-
viously seen in the FUSE spectra of U Gem in quiescence
(Long et al. 2006), are not detected here in the spectrum.
The line identiﬁcations process is explained in the analy-
sis section where each spectrum (and its sub-exposures)
are modeled with realistic photospheric WD models. We
list the absorption lines in Table 3 where only the rest
(laboratory) wavelength is listed for each line, since the

Note—All the lines listed here have
been marked in Figs.5 and 6. As de-
scribed in the analysis section, many
lines were identiﬁed by comparing them
to low-metallicity synthetic stellar spec-
tra while increasing the abundance of
one species (metal) at a time.
In this
manner we identiﬁed the sawtooth pat-
tern between ∼ 1450 ˚A and ∼ 1600 ˚A
as a multitude of small iron absorption
lines (Fe ii). Lines anotated with an as-
terisk (*) are contaminated with detec-
tor artifacts.

exact position of the lines changes for each sub-exposure.
Not unsurprizingly the COS spectrum of U Gem does
not show any interstellar absorption lines as it is a nearby
system.

The long wavelength segment of the epoch # 1 spec-
trum is displayed in Fig.6, where, for clarity, the vertical
scale has been stretched. The ﬁrst striking feature of
the long wavelength segment spectrum are the numerous
absorption features seen at wavelengths below 1400 ˚A.
An inspection of the sub-exposures reveals that most of
the ‘lines’ are due to detector artifacts (gain sag in re-
gions illuminated by airglow), as they are seen in each
sub-exposure shifted by 20 ˚A. Below 1400 ˚A, we detect
with conﬁdence Si iii (∼1300) and C ii (1324) lines. The
C ii (1335) is contaminated with a detector artifact. All

the other features between 1265 ˚A and 1380 ˚A are detec-
tor artifacts. Fortunately, the longer wavelength region
is not aﬀected and we identify silicon lines (Si iv doublet
∼1400; Si iii ∼1342, 1417, 1500; Si ii 1527, 1533), the
C iv (1550) line, the He ii (1640) line, as well as aluminum
(Al iii 1855, 1863) and possibly argon (Ar iii 1670) lines.
In the line analysis section we will show that the saw-
tooth pattern observed from ∼ 1420 ˚A to ∼1630 ˚A is
likely due to iron (Fe ii).

3. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS RESULTS AND

DISCUSSION

We

use

Ivan Hubeny’s FORTRAN suite

SYNSPEC (Hubeny
to generate synthetic

of
codes TLUSTY and
1988;
spec-
Hubeny & Lanz 1995)
tra for high-gravity stellar atmosphere models. We
ﬁrst generate a one-dimensional vertical stellar atmo-
sphere structure with TLUSTY for a given surface
gravity log(g), eﬀective surface temperature Teﬀ, and
surface composition of the star. We treat hydrogen
and helium explicitly, and treat nitrogen, carbon and
oxygen implicitly (Hubeny & Lanz 1995). We then run
SYNSPEC using the output stellar atmosphere model
from TLUSTY as an input, and generate a synthetic
stellar spectrum over a given (input) wavelength range,
here from 900 ˚A to 3200 ˚A. The code SYNSPEC
derives the detailed radiation and ﬂux distribution of
continuum and lines and generates the output spectrum.
For temperatures above 35,000 K the approximate
NLTE treament of
lines is turned on in SYNSPEC
(Hubeny & Lanz 1995). Rotational and instrumental
broadening as well as limb darkening are reproduced
using the routine ROTIN. For full details of the codes
see Hubeny & Lanz (2017a,b,c).

Following this procedure, we generated photospheric
models for U Gem in quiescence with an eﬀective WD
temperature ranging from 25,000 K to 50,000 K in in-
crements of 1,000 K, 500 K, and ∼250 K, as needed for
the convergence of the model ﬁt. The eﬀective surface
gravity was set to log(g) = 8.8 to match the large mass
of the WD ∼ 1.1 − 1.2M⊙. We varied the projected
stellar rotational velocity Vrot sin(i) from 100 km s−1 to
250 km s−1 to match the known WD velocity of about
100 − 150 km s−1, and in order to ﬁt the absorption fea-
tures of the spectrum, we varied the abundances of the
elements, one at a time, from 0.01× solar to 20× solar.
The spectral analysis to derive the eﬀective WD tem-
perature and the abundance of the elements was carried
out iteratively. Namely, we ﬁrst assessed the WD tem-
perature using solar abundances, then for that temper-
ature we varied the abundances one element at a time,
then we ﬁne-tuned the WD temperature using the best-
ﬁt abundances.

3.1. Abundances

Except for hydrogen and helium that were set to solar
abundances, we started by setting all the metals (i.e. Z >
2) to a very low abundance such that no absorption lines

Note—The lines were ﬁtted with a rotational broadening velocity of 150 km s−1. The values listed are accurate to the next
adjacent discrete values (see text). The abundances derived from the C iii 1175, N iii 1185, N iii 1184, and Si iii 1160 line
complexes were deemed unreliable and are marked with an asterix * (top of the table). Unreliable abudances within the table
are also marked with an asterix * . No value is given for lines in the detector gap or in very noisy regions of the sub-exposure.

formed in the theoretical spectra, except for the lines of
the hydrogen Lyman and helium Balmer series. We then
increased the abundance of one metal at a time starting
at 0.01× solar, up to 20× solar, taking all the discrete
values : 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.15,
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15,
20. In this manner we generated theoretical spectra with
varied abundances for C, N, O, P, S, Si, Al, Ar, Fe, Mg,
Na, and Ne, one at a time. In all the models we choose
log(g) = 8.8, and for the ﬁrst epoch spectra the WD
temperature was set (see next sub-section) to 41,500 K,
for the second epoch T = 39, 850 K, for the third epoch
T = 37, 650 K, and for the fourth and last epoch T =
36, 350 K. We then ﬁtted each line in each single sub-
exposure with the varied abundances WD spectra until
a match was found.

The ﬁtting did not reveal abundances for O, P, Mg,
Na or Ne (there were no matching lines). In Table 4 we
list the abundances we found for C, N, S, Si, and Al,
and in Fig.7 we illustrate the abundance ﬁts for these
ions. Some spectral regions (e.g. N III ∼990, Fig.7(a))
are more noisy than others (e.g. Si iv 1400, Fig.7(l)),
and some line complexes (e.g. Si iii 1110, Fig.7(h)) ex-

considers only the vicinity of a given line (or complex),
then in some cases the continuum is diﬃcult to iden-
tify (e.g. Figs.7(a),(d)). For that reason the abundances
were checked visually for each line in each sub-exposure.
For the N iii (∼990) line (Fig.7(a)), in spite of the fact
that the region is very noisy, the data do agree with a
very large nitrogen abundance [N]=20× solar or larger.
For the N iii (∼1085) absorption feature (Fig.7, panel
b), the depth of the line barely changes from [N]=0.01
(solid red line) to [N]=20.0 (solid green line), and con-
sequently one cannot rely on this feature to assess the
nitrogen abundance. In addition, the exact wavelength
of the line is also diﬃcult to assess: a [N]=1 model red-
shifted by more than 1 ˚A is also shown for comparison
(solid blue line) and it ﬁts only the right wing of the
line, while the two other models ﬁt only the left wing of
the line. As to the the N iii (1184) absorption feature
(panel c), it seems to be more reliable, however, the ﬁt-
ting of the adjacent C iii (1175) line complex brings up
the question of how to assess the continuum ﬂux level.
For the nitrogen abundance derived from the N iii (1184)
absorption feature, as well as for most of the other abun-

at a given wavelength for a speciﬁc ionized species from a single sub-exposure spectrum (solid black line) together with
the theoretical models (color coded) as indicated in each panel. This ﬁgure qualitatively illustrates how the abundance
for each ion listed in Table 4 was assessed. See text for details.

dances derived here, we used the continuum ﬂux level
obtained from ﬁtting the entire theoretical spectrum to
the observed spectrum. For the C iii (1175) absorption
feature (panel d), we found that the left wing (including
two additional smaller carbon absorption lines to its left)
and the right wing cannot be ﬁtted simultaneously. The
ﬁtting of the left side of the feature (as shown in panel
d, giving [C]≈0.4) yields a higher continuum ﬂux level
than derived from the global ﬁt. The ﬁtting of the right
side of the feature, while giving the same continuum ﬂux
level as derived from the global ﬁt, does not agree at all
with the left side of the feature and produces a line that
is far too narrow ([C]=0.01). This could be due to detec-
tor eﬀects near the edge of the spectral segment, where
the ﬂux seems to drop. This wavelength region is only
covered for one of the four detector positions used with
COS, i.e. only one in four sub-exposures, we therefore
decided not to rely on this carbon absorption feature,
nor on the N iii 1184 feature. For the carbon abundance,
we are left with the C iv doublet (1400, shown in panel
e) which is covered in all the sub-exposures. Here the
abundance is assessed mainly by ﬁtting the wings of the
absorption feature. The aluminum abundance is derived
by ﬁtting the Al iii doublet near 1860 ˚A , as shown in
panel f. For the sub-exposure displayed, the aluminum
abundance is in excess of 20× solar. The sulfur abun-
dance was derived by ﬁtting the S iv (1063 & 1073) lines
(shown in panel g). This region of the spectral segment
is very noisy and we found that the ﬁtting of the 1063
line, which is to be narrower than the 1073 line, gave
a lower abundance than the 1073 line, possibly due to
the noise. Nevertheless, the sulphur abundance listed in
Table 4 is an average taken from ﬁtting the two lines. Sil-
icon abundances were derived from ﬁtting 5 absorption
line complexes. The Si iii (∼1112), displayed in panel
h, shows another example of a complex with lines that
are shifted relative to one another. The Si iv (∼1126)
displayed in panel i, shows how the right side of the ab-
sorption feature (at λ > 1132 ˚A) has a reduced ﬂux in
the vicinity of the edge of the spectral segment (followed
by a gradual drop to zero at 1140 ˚A). The Si iii (1143)
absorption feature (panel j) is not very pronounced or
deep, but still provides a relatively good assessment of
the silicon abundance, contrary to the Si iii (1160) ab-
sorption feature (panel h) which is unreliable as it does
not match the expected lines. The Si iv (1400) doublet
(panel l) provides a more reliable assessement of the sil-
icon abundance, in particular with the additional small
line seen around 1419 ˚A . Accordingly, in Table 4, we
marked all the absorption features and abundances that
are unreliable with an asterix.

For argon (Ar iii ∼1669.5, see Fig.9), we found that
the abundance would have to be 100× solar or larger.
It is possible the ∼1669 absorption features belongs to a
diﬀerent element which we could not identify.

The iron abundance was derived by ﬁtting the saw-
tooth pattern in the wavelength range ∼ 1500 − 1600 ˚A,
as shown in Fig.8.

Overall we found that carbon and sulfur are both con-
sistent with sub-solar to solar abundances; nitrogen, alu-
minum and argon have all supra-solar abundances. Sili-
con is sub-solar except for the Si iii (∼ 1112 ˚A) and Si iv
(1400 ˚A) lines that match about solar abundances, con-
ﬁrming the claim of Long et al. (2006) that the Si iii lines
at ∼1110 ˚A require abundances that are much larger than
required at 1140 and 1155 ˚A. We note, however, that the
silicon lines at ∼ 1112 ˚A can be ﬁt with a lower tempera-
ture, namely Teﬀ = 25 − 35, 000 K. We will come back to
this in section 3.4. The supra-solar nitrogen abundance
with the sub-solar carbon abundance further conﬁrms
the anomalously high N/C ratio observed in previous
spectra of U Gem in quiescence that has been attributed
to CNO processing (Sion et al. 1998; Long et al. 2006).
At solar abundance, the He ii 1640 absorption feature
needs a higher rotational velocity of 200-250 km s−1 in
some of the sub-exposure spectra. We also found that
the Si iv doublet (∼ 1400 ˚A) appears to be oﬀ (red-
shifted) by about one Angstrom compared to other lines,
as noted by Long et al. (2006) who suggested that they
not always form in the stellar photosphere. Some of the
absorption lines appear to be transient (see next subsec-
tion). We also found that the width, shape, shift and
depth of many lines are not uniform and vary, even in a
single sub-exposure, indicating that the lines do not form
in the same medium. At a ﬁrst glance (e.g. Table 4), the
abundances do not seem to change as a function of the
time since outburst. We, therefore, decided to analyze

lar, was assessed by ﬁtting the sawtooth pattern in the
∼ 1400 − 1600 ˚A region of the spectrum with a synthetic
WD stellar model spectrum (solid black line). The model
has a temperature of 41,500 K, a projected rotational
velocity of 150 km s−1, hydrogen and helium solar abun-
dances, but no metal except for iron. The iron was in-
creased gradually until the sawtooth pattern could be ﬁt
in some regions of the spectrum. As an example we dis-
play some of these regions here in the rectangular boxes.
From a careful examination we found that lines could be
ﬁtted for [Fe]=1 × solar (e.g. box d) to [Fe]=3 × solar
(e.g. box b). The COS spectrum displayed here (solid
red line) is the ﬁrst sub-exposure of the second orbit ob-
tained at epoch # 1 (phase φ = 0.81). Similar ﬁts were
obtained for all sub-exposures.

The variation of the strength of the absorption lines as a function of the orbital phase. The spectra

were generated by co-adding a number of sub-exposures in the immediate vicity of the orbital phase as shown on the
right. The aluminum (Al iii 1854.7 & 1862.8) and argon (Ar iii ∼1669.5) absorption lines (upper panels) are stronger
around phase φ ∼0.25 and 0.75, and are much weaker (almost unoticable) around phases φ ∼0.0 and 0.5. The carbon
(C iv ∼1550) and helium (He ii 1640) lines (lower panels) do now show such a strong phase variability. Note the
strengthening of the Si ii (1526.7 & 1533.4) lines around phase φ ∼ 0.25 and especially at phase φ = 0.78 (to the left
of the C iv lines in lower left panel). The spectrum at phase 1.00 (0.00) was obtained by combining the sub-exposure
spectra from phases 0.96, 0.99, 0.00, and 0.03; the spectrum at phase 0.88 from phases 0.85, 0.86, 0.88, and 0.91; the
spectrum at phase 0.81 from phases 0.80 and 0.81; the spectrum at phase 0.67 from phases 0.66 and 0.69; the spectrum
at phase 0.54 from phases 0.51, 0.54, and 0.57; and the spectrum at phase 0.25 from phases 0.21, 0.25, and 0.30.

3.2. Orbital Phase Variability of the Absorption

Lines

We use the ephemeris of U Gem as given by
Echevarr´ıa et al. (2007) to ﬁnd the phase at which each
sub-exposure was obtained, where we take the phase
φ = 0 as the secondary conjunction. The phase of the
start of each exposure is indicated in Fig.3 as well as in
the last column in Table 4 to within an accuracy of 0.01
(∼ 150 s).

By visual inspection of the sub-exposure spectra, we
found that many absorption lines appear stronger/deeper
at some orbital phases, regardless of the epoch at which
the spectra were taken. We, therefore, decided to exam-
ine the sub-exposure spectra in order of increasing orbital
phase from 0.0 to 1.0 and to combine them near the same
orbital phases when possible. Following this procedure
we generated 9 spectra at orbital phases 0.00 (made of 4
sub-exposures), 0.16 (1 sub-exposure), 0.25 (3), 0.54 (3),
0.67 (2), 0.78 (1), 0.81 (2), 0.88 (4) 0.98 (1), and 1.00
(=0.00). We found that the Al iii (1854.7, 1862.8), Ar iii
(∼1669.5), and Si ii (1526.7, 1533.4) absorption lines are
particularly sharp and deep at orbital phases φ = 0.25
and 0.78, and are much weaker (almost absent) around
orbital phases φ ∼ 0.54 and 0.00 (1.00) (see Fig.9). Al iii
appears to be stronger at phases 0.78 & 0.81 and 0.16 &
0.25, namely over a wider range of phases.

Most of the other metal absorption lines (especially
the silicon lines in the range ∼ 1110 to ∼ 1130 ˚A) seem
to exhibit some change with the orbital phase, where
the depth of the absorption lines decreases from phase
∼0.80 (deepest), to phase ∼0.25 (intermediate), and
phases ∼0.0 and ∼0.54 (shallowest, see Fig.10). The Si iv
(1400), and C iv (1550) absorption lines are only slightly
deeper around phase 0.25 and 0.80, while the He ii (1640)
absorption line does not exhibit such a variation. Due to
the wavelength coverage of the sub-exposure spectra we
could not carry out the same analysis for the the C iii
(1175) and N iii (1183) absorption lines.
In addition,
the low S/N below 1100 ˚A prevented us from obtain-
ing robust results for absorption lines in that wavelength
region.

In spite of the fact that the sub-exposure spectra were
obtained at 4 diﬀerent epochs, the results show a con-
sistent increase in the depth of the absorption lines at
indicating the
orbital phases 0.16-0.30 and 0.67-0.81,
presence of an absorbing material with high metal con-
tent (i.e.
Si, Al, Ar) in front of the WD at those
phases. This is in complete agreement with the results
of Froning et al. (2001); Long et al. (2006) who found
an increase in depths of the lines and the sudden ap-
pearance of low-ionization lines at orbital phase between
0.53 and 0.85. These are the same orbital phases at
which the X-ray and EUV light-curves dip, as seen in U
Gem in both outburst and quiescence (Mason et al. 1988;
Long et al. 1996; Szkody et al. 1996). The increase in the
depth of the absorption lines and the EUV/X-ray light
curve dips have possibly the same origin, i.e. a (rim)
disk bulge with mass stream overﬂow material located

at large disk radii to agree with the observed low radial
velocity (Froning et al. 2001; Long et al. 2006). The in-
crease in the depth of the lines around phase 0.16-0.30
can be attributed to the stream material overﬂowing the
disk rim and bouncing oﬀ the disk surface near phase 0.5
where it is then redirected toward phase ∼ 0.10 − 0.30
(Kunze et al. 2001).

The silicon lines in the wavelength range
1100-1130 ˚A are deeper around phase 0.80, and shallower
around phase 0.54 (and 1.00 - not shown for clarity). The
increase in the depth of the absorption lines indicates
the presence of absorbing material in front of the WD at
phases ∼ 0.25 and ∼ 0.80. The spectrum around phase
0.54 was created by combining together the sub-exposure
spectra from phases 0.51, 0.53, 0.54 and 0.57, the phase
0.25 spectrum was obtained from combining phases 0.21,
0.24, 0.25 and 0.30, and that of phase 0.80 was from
combining phases 0.78, 0.80 and 0.81.

In order to try and further identify the location of the
formation of the absorption lines in the COS spectrum of
U Gem, we measured the velocity shift of the lines in each
sub-exposure spectra. We match each line individually
with the corresponding line in a synthetic stellar atmo-
sphere spectrum generated with TLUSTY/SYNSPEC,
and we (red- or blue-) shifted the spectrum until the ob-
served line became superposed to the theoretical line. In
this manner we obtained a spectral shift accurate within
∼0.1 ˚A , which we then translated into a radial velocity
shift. The lines for which the velocity was measured were
the C iv (1550), Si iv (1400, 1122.5, 1128.3), Si iii (1113,
1144, 1500), and Si ii (1530). For the C iii (1175), N iii
(1183), and Al iii (∼1860) lines only a limited number of
dataset were available. The velocity shift of the absorp-
tion lines is displayed as a function of the orbital phase
in Fig.11, together with the expected velocity shift of the
WD, taking into account a 122 km s−1 orbital velocity
(Long et al. 2006), a 80.4 km s−1 gravitational redshift
(Sion et al. 1998), and a recessional velocity of 84 km s−1
(Wade 1981). The ﬁrst thing that is striking in Fig.11

12

is the large scatter observed at all phases, but this scat-
ter has been observed before (Froning et al. 2001). The
carbon lines (in black) appear to follow the WD velocity
more closely than the other lines, and the Si iv lines seem
to have the largest velocity oﬀset, followed closely by the
Si iii lines. Long et al. (2006) also found the Si iv dou-
blet (∼ 1400 ˚A) to be red-shifted by about one Angstrom
compared to the other lines, suggesting that they not al-
ways form in the stellar photosphere. For the most part
the velocity oﬀset of the silicon is positive, indicative of
material falling toward the WD. The average velocity
oﬀset is the largest (positive) at phases 0.78-0.91, which
is consitent with the location of the L1-stream material
overﬂowing the disk’s edge and falling toward smaller
radii.

rest wavelengths for the 23 sub-exposures using a syn-

ity amplitude of ∼122 km s−1 (Long et al. 2006), a WD
gravitational redshift of ∼80.4 km s−1 (Sion et al. 1998),
and a proper motion radial velocity of ∼84 km s−1 for
the U Gem (Wade 1981). The carbon lines (black circles
& dots) follow more closely the WD orbital velocity. The
Si iv (λλ 1122.5, 1128.3, ∼1400) lines (red stars) exhibit
the largest oﬀset from the WD orbital velocity, followed
by Si iii (λλ ∼1113, ∼1144, 1500) lines (red circles) &
Si ii (λλ1530) lines (red triangles). Only a small num-
ber of data points could be obtained for nitrogen (green
diamonds) and aluminum (blue squares).

3.3. Orbital Phase Variability of the Continuum.

The 12 sub-exposures of the ﬁrst epoch are covering
a complete binary orbit and where all obtained within
that time frame. The sub-exposures obtained at epoch

# 2, 3 and 4 have a lower ﬂux since they were obtained
as the system was declining. Consequently, in order to
check the variability of the continuum in a self-consistent
manner, we used only the 12 sub-exposures from the
ﬁrst epoch. For each of the 12 sub-exposures we inte-
grated the ﬂux from 915 ˚A to 2000 ˚A and normalized it.
The resulting COS FUV lightcurve is presented in Fig.12
and exhibits an orbital phase variability with a maxi-
mum amplitude of only ± 5%, which is relatively small
compared to +20% and -30% observed in FUSE obser-
vations obtained in deep quiescence (Long et al. 2006).
Even though the lightcurve is made of only 12 data
points covering the entire binary orbit, we notice that the
two lowest points are at φ = 0.25 (local minimum) and
φ = 0.78 (global minimum), with maximum at phases
φ = 0.81 − 0.91.

In order to make a better comparison with the FUSE
and optical lightcurves, we generated two lightcurves,
one covering the shorter wavelengths 915-1100 ˚A , and
the other one covering the 1380-2000 ˚A region (Fig.13).

is a dip at φ = 0.25 and a second deeper dip at φ = 0.78,
and a maximum toward φ ∼ 0.8 − 0.9. The total ﬂux
(915-2000 ˚A) varies by only ±5%.

actual feature of the shorter wavelengths only, while the
maximum is more pronounced in the longer wavelengths.

 
 
FUV Spectroscopy of U Gem

The two dips observed in Fig.12 appear mainly as fea-
tures in the short wavelength lightcurve only (in blue in
Fig.13). The two dips correspond to veiling of the WD
by the same L1-stream material that has overﬂowed the
disk rim (near φ ∼ 0.9): ﬁrst as it overﬂows higher above
the disk toward smaller radii near φ = 0.78, then as it
is re-directed toward phase φ ∼0.25 after it has bounced
oﬀ the disk surface near phase 0.5 (Kunze et al. 2001).
This is completely consistent with the FUSE lightcurve
revealing dips at orbtial phase 0.6-0.85 as well as at or-
bital phase 0.2-0.35. Note that in the FUSE lightcurve
the ﬂux below 970 ˚A decreases substantially during the
∼ 0.7 phase dip (Long et al. 2006).

The longer wavelength lightcurve (Fig.13) exhibits an
increase of ﬂux near phase 0.8-0.9. This is similar to
the optical (blue and red) light curves revealing a strong
hump at phase 0.8-0.9 due to the contribution of the
hot spot facing the observer and before it is occulted
by the secondary near phase 0.0 (Unda-Sanzana et al.
2006; Echevarr´ıa et al. 2007). A secondary broad hump
around phase 0.25 is also observed in the Hα & Hβ light
curves (Marsh et al. 1990; Unda-Sanzana et al. 2006;
Echevarr´ıa et al. 2007).

3.4. The White Dwarf Temperature

Since many absorption lines in the spectrum of U
Gem are either forming in an absorbing medium in
front of the WD, or are being aﬀected by that absorbing
medium, we decided to model the WD spectrum using
the continuum and not concentrate on the metal
absorption lines in the model ﬁt. The continuum is
essentially characterized by its slope and by the broad
absorption features of the hydrogen Lyman and helium
Balmer series. The advantage of the COS spectrum is
that it covers the spectral range down to the Lyman limit
(though the Lyα feature falls into the detector gap) and
consequently allows us to derive the WD temperature
by ﬁtting the Lyman series. While the continuum slope
can also be used to derive the WD temperature, it is not
as sensitive to the temperature as the Lyman series (for
the WD temperatures considered here). For our WD
temperature analysis, we combined the sub-exposure
spectra by epoch to generate 4 spectra, one for each
epoch. Since the ﬁrst epoch has 12 sub-exposures, its
spectrum has a much higher S/N than the second, third
and fourth exposure spectra. Also, since the lines have
a ‘scattered’ velocity broadening of about 300 km s−1
(see Fig.11; reaching almost 400 km s−1 at φ = 0.25),
we shifted only the ﬁrst epoch sub-exposure spectra by
the WD orbital velocity before combining them. As a
results the absorption lines have a velocity broadening
larger than the known WD projected rotational velocity
of 100-150 km s−1.
In order to approximately match
the absorption lines we set up solar abundances for all
elements, except for nitrogen and aluminum that were
both set to 20× solar. We then modeled the 4 epoch
spectra with synthetic WD (with log(g) = 8.8) model
spectra generated in the manner described at the very

beginning of this section.

3.4.1. The First Epoch.

As we ﬁtted synthetic WD model spectra to the ﬁrst
epoch spectrum, we found that the slope of the COS con-
tinuum in the longer wavelength down to 2000 ˚A agreed
with a temperature as low as 25,000 K which gives an ex-
tremely short distance (43pc) but did not provide enough
ﬂux below 1200 ˚A and basically no ﬂux below 1000 ˚A . As
we increased the temperature to 35,000 K, the slope of
the theoretical continuum decreased very slowly, while
the short wavelength region was still deﬁcient in ﬂux
and the proﬁle of the Lyman series were not ﬁtted prop-
erly. In the longer wavelength the slope of the continuum
agreed down to about λ ∼1800 ˚A but the model was very
slightly deﬁcient in ﬂux for λ > 1800 ˚A.

In order to match the proﬁle of the Lyman series
(down to ∼ 940 ˚A), we had to increase the temperature
to 41,500 K, while the continuum of the model in the
longer wavelengths slightly decreased. The Lyman se-
ries is much more sensitive to the temperature than the
continuum slope in the longer wavelength and therefore
provides a much more reliable way to determine the tem-
perature of the WD. This model presents a satisfactory
ﬁt to the overall spectrum and is presented in Fig.14.

Our grid of model for epoch 1 is spaced every 250 K,
and we ﬁnd that the best ﬁt spans 3 models,
from
40,250 K to 40,750 K, giving limiting values of 40,000 K
and 41,000 K. We therefore take a 500 K error bar for
the WD temperature, namely, for the ﬁrst epoch spec-
trum we ﬁnd a WD temperature of 41,500 K±500 K, 15
days after the peak of the outburst. For comparison, a
40,500 K model has a ﬂux that is 3% too low at 1000 ˚A
when scaled from the ﬂux at 1400 ˚A , but the calibration
errors of COS are ∼1.5% at 1400 ˚A .

With a distance of 100.3 pc, the scaled WD radius
is Rwd =5,029 km, corresponding to a WD mass of
Mwd = 1.111 M⊙ at a temperature of 41,500 K (Wood
1995; Panei et al. 2000). The WD mass and radius give
an eﬀective surface gravity of log(g) = 8.765 which is
consistent with our assumption of log(g) = 8.8. This
model is a little deﬁcient in ﬂux at very short wavelengths
(< 950 ˚A) and long wavelengths (> 1725 ˚A , see Fig.14).
A possible explanation for the discrepancy in the very
long wavelength region could be a detector edges eﬀects
as apparent from Fig.2.

There are other possible emitting components in the
system such as the hot spot (L1-stream impacting the rim
of the disk), the boundary layer, or the very low mass ac-
cretion rate disk which could contribute additional ﬂux.
It has also been suggested that the WD itself could have a
hot accretion belt remaining in its equatorial region after
ouburst, or the WD could have a non-uniform tempera-
ture (Long et al. 1993; Sion et al. 1998; Long & Gilliland
1999; Long et al. 2006). As mentioned previously, not all
the silicon lines can be ﬁtted at the same time with the
same abundance, however, this could also be due to two

days after the peak of the outburst, is modeled with a WD photosphere spectrum (in black). The observed spectrum
extends from ∼915 ˚A (the hydrogen Lyman limit) to ∼2150 ˚A , while the theoretical spectrum extends from 900 ˚A
to 3200 ˚A . The spectral regions of the observed spectrum that are matched to the theoretical spectrum are in red,
the excluded regions are in blue; namely, λ < 915 ˚A, λ > 2000 ˚A, and the gap betweens the two spectral segments
overlaping the hydrogen Lyα region ∼ 1190 − 1268 ˚A. The model has log(g) = 8.8 and is scaled to the distance of
∼100pc, giving a a temperature of 41,500 K, with a projected rotational velocity of 250 km s−1. The abundances
are all solar, except for nitrogen and aluminum which had to be set to 20 times solar to ﬁt the absorption features.
Note in the very long wavelengths, the model is slightly deﬁcient in ﬂux, which could be due to the small contribution
from a very weak component, but could also be due to some detector eﬀect as shown in the lower panel of Fig.2.
This spectrum is a combination of 12 sub-exposures and has the best S/N, but consequently it also suﬀers from line
broadening.

emitting components with a diﬀerent temperature. For
example the Si ii (1530) and Si iii (∼ 1112) lines are best
ﬁtted at ∼30,000 K (assuming log(g) = 8.8), while the
other silicon lines give a better ﬁt at 35,000-45,000 K.
We therefore tried two-temperature WD models, with a
hot equatorial region on the surface of a cooler WD.

In order to ﬁt the longer wavelength region, we started
by taking a low WD temperature (∼ 25, 000 K) model
(with a corresponding larger radius) that did not provide
any ﬂux in the short wavelength region, and added to it
the contribution from a hotter region (T ∼ 45, 000 K and
higher) to provide ﬂux in the shorter wavelength region.
Such models did not ﬁt the COS spectrum better than
the single WD models. We varied the size and tempera-
ture of the hot equatorial region and the temperature of
the WD, but this combined model did not provide a qual-
itatively better ﬁt to the single WD model and was not
required by the data. The number of two-temperature
models that could ﬁt the data was very large (divergence
of the solution). Therefore, in in our analysis below, we
only considered single WD models.

The WD temperature depends on the assumed eﬀec-
tive surface gravity (log(g)) of the model as well as on the
addition of a hot second component (Long et al. 1995,
2006)). The second component is not always detected
(Sion et al. 1998), either because of the wavelength cov-
erage (i.e. λ > 1, 000 ˚A) or maybe simply because it is
not always there. The nature of the second component
is still a matter of debate, as diﬀerent physical mod-
els for the second component ﬁt the data just as well
(Long et al. 2006). Nevertheless, the WD temperature
we obtained two weeks after the peak of the outburst
is in good agreement with previous spectral analysis of
the system in quiescence and decline (Sion et al. 1998;
Long & Gilliland 1999; Froning et al. 2001; Long et al.
2006).

3.4.2. The Second Epoch.

With only three sub-exposures, the second epoch spec-
trum has a much noisier spectrum, especially in the short
wavelength region. Our single WD model ﬁt gave a tem-
perature of 39,850±500 K , and a scaled WD radius of

Figure 15. The COS spectrum of U Gem obtained at epoch #2, 21 days since the peak of the ouburst, is modeled with
a WD photosphere spectrum, as in the previous ﬁgure. The temperature obtained from the ﬁtting is 39,850 K. The
abundances are all solar, except for nitrogen and aluminum which were set to 20 times solar. This spectrum is pretty
noisy, especially in the very short wavelength region, as it is a combination of only 3 sub-exposures (sub-exposure #2
was lost due to the COS light path being blocked).

5,022 km, nearly equal to that obtained for epoch # 1.
However, due to the slightly lower temperature, this ra-
dius corresponds to a 1.109M⊙ WD mass, or a log(g) of
8.766. This model ﬁt is presented in Fig.15. This spec-
trum was obtained 21 days after the peak of the outburst,
exhibiting a cooling of 1,650 K in 6 days. The discrep-
ancy in the long wavelength region is barely noticeable,
but it is still noticeable in the very short wavelength re-
gion. The broadening of the lines (200 km s−1) includes
some orbital velocity broadening as well as lines form-
ing in diﬀerent regions, as the projected WD rotational
velocity is known to be about 100-150 km s−1.

3.4.3. The Third Epoch.

With 4 sub-exposure spectra obtained 33 days after
the outburst peak, the third epoch spectrum yielded a
WD temperature of 37,650±500 K and a scaled radius of
4,999 km. This corresponds to a WD mass of 1.109M⊙
and an eﬀective surface gravity of log(g) = 8.77. In 17
days (since epoch # 2), the WD temperature dropped
by an additional 2200 K. Compared to the two previous
epoch spectra, the model ﬁt (Fig.16) has improved, there
is no more discrepancy in the long wavelength region, and
it is barely noticeable in the short wavelength region.

3.4.4. The Fourth Epoch.

Also with 4 sub-exposure spectra, the fourth and last
epoch spectrum was ﬁtted with a single WD model with
a temperature of 36,250±500 K (Fig.17), revealing a fur-
ther cooling of 1400 K in 23 days (i.e. 56 days after
the outburst peak). The scaled radius obtained was
5,005 km, corresponding to a WD mass of 1.107M⊙ and
an eﬀective surface gravity of log(g) = 8.768. Here too,
there is no more discrepancy in the long wavelength re-
gion, and very little discrepancy in the short wavelength
region.

For the third and fourth epoch spectra, the ﬁt to the
continuum is relatively good and there is little indication
of a possible second emitting component. We ﬁnd that
our results are self-consistent with a massive WD with
an eﬀective surface gravity of log(g) ≈ 8.77 (as there is
basically no diﬀerence between theoretical spectra with
log(g) = 8.77 or log(g) = 8.8 - which was our initial
assumption), and a radius of about 5,000 km. If we take
the error in the distance, of about 4%, into account, we
ﬁnd an error in the WD radius of 200 km, giving Rwd =
5000 ± 200 km. We ﬁnd that the WD cools by 5,250 K
in 41 days, from a temperature of 41,500 K 15 days after
the peak of the outburst, down to 36,250 K 56 days after
the peak of the outburst. The cooling of the WD is
displayed in Fig.18. The WD radius and temperatures
we obtained in our analysis are consistent with the results

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have obtained HST/COS spectra of U Gem follow-
ing a wide outburst when the WD dominated the FUV.
The spectra were taken at 4 epochs, 15 days, 21 days,
33 days, and 56 days after the peak of the outburst, and
reveal a decreasing FUV ﬂux as a function of time, an
obvious sign of the cooling of the WD.

1. The HST/COS spectra of U Gem exhibits the usual
hydrogen Lyman and helium Balmer absoprtion
lines forming in the WD photosphere, as well as
absorption lines of low ionization energy species of
carbon (C ii iii iv), nitrogen (N iii), sulphur (S iv)
and silicon (Si ii iii iv). We also identiﬁed absorp-
tion lines of iron (Fe ii), aluminum (Al iii), and pos-
sibly also argon (Ar˙iii). All the metal lines could
potentially form in the photosphere of a moder-
ately hot WD. However, many of them (i.e. Si,
Al, Ar) are deeper at orbital phases φ ∼ 0.25 and
φ =0.67-0.81, indicating the presence of absorbing
material at these speciﬁc phases. Higher ionization
energy species of N iv and O vi seen in absorption
are known to form at a much higher temperature
(∼ 80, 000 K) and are not attributed to the WD.
The spectra do not show any emission features.

the short wavelength range. The FUV light curves
display an increase in ﬂux near phase φ = 0.9, a
small dip near phase φ = 0.25 and a stronger dip
near phase φ = 0.78. The increase in ﬂux at φ =
0.9 is most likely due to the hot spot facing the ob-
server (Unda-Sanzana et al. 2006; Echevarr´ıa et al.
2007). The dip around phase φ = 0.78 is due to L1-
stream material overﬂowing the disk rim and falling
toward smaller radii, where it has been shown to
bounce back oﬀ the disk plane near phase φ = 0.5;
there it is re-directed toward φ ≈ 0.2 (Kunze et al.
2001), where it is likely responsible for the small dip
observed in the FUV lightcurve at φ = 0.25. The
overﬂowing L1-stream material is also responsible
for the strong orbital phase variation of the depth
of the the absorption lines of silicon, aluminum and
argon.

3. Our analysis of absorption lines velocity as a func-
tion of the binary orbital phase reveals an overall
red-shift in the velocity of the silicon lines, espe-
cially Si iii & iv, compared to the WD orbital ve-
locity, indicating material falling towards the WD.
The largest velocity shift in the lines is observed
around phase φ ∼ 0.78 − 0.91. The carbon lines
appear to follow more closely the WD orbital ve-
locity, implying that they are probably forming in
the WD photosphere.

4. The spectra exhibit solar to sub-solar abundances
of carbon and sulfur, supra-solar (up to 20×) abun-
dances of nitrogen, aluminum, and argon, while
iron is only marginally supra-solar (2×). Silicon is
sub-solar except for the Si iii (∼ 1112 ˚A) and Si iv
(1400 ˚A) that are solar. Our analysis indicates that
the silcon, aluminum and argon lines are at least in
part forming in material above the disk veiling the
WD at orbital phases φ ∼ 0.25 and 0.75. In spite
of the fact that many lines might be aﬀected by ab-
sorbing material in front of the WD at all orbital
phases, our analysis conﬁrms the high N/C ratio
observed previously in the FUV spectra of U Gem
in quiescence, a sign of possible CNO enrichment
of the accreted material on the WD surface.

5. At the time of the ﬁrst epoch, 15 days after the
peak of the outburst, the WD was still rather hot
reaching a temperature of 41,500 K. By the time of
the 4th epoch, 41 days later, the WD had cooled
down to a temperature of 36,250 K. The tempera-
tures we obtained are consistent with previous ob-
servation of U Gem in quiescence for the log(g)
considered here (Long et al. 2006) and are theoret-
ically consistent with compressional heating and
subsequent cooling of the WD as shown by Sion
(1995).

2. The ﬁrst epoch spectra cover en entire orbital phase
and show a variation in the continuum ﬂux level
with the orbital phase that is more pronounced in

6. The spectra are consistent with a single temper-
ature WD component, and two-temperature WD
models did not provide any improvment in the ﬁt.

18

Our single WD temperature model ﬁts are self-
consistent with a massive WD with an eﬀective
surface gravity log(g) = 8.77 and a (∼ 40, 000 K)
WD radius of 5000 ± 200 km corresponding to a
WD mass Mwd ≈ 1.11M⊙ and consistent with
previous spectral analysis of U Gem in quiescence
(Long et al. 2006).

7. We conﬁrm that phase-dependent absorption is the
most plausible interpretation of the time-variable
absorption seen in the FUV spectra of U Gem
during quiescence, and we concur with Long et al.
(2006) that it complicates the analysis of the WD
spectra.

The picture that emerges from the orbital phase
variability of the spectra is a familiar one. The
L1-stream material hits the disk’s rim near φ =
0.81 − 0.91 creating a peak in the UV light curve
at that orbital phase. Some of the material over-
ﬂows the disk’s edge and moves to smaller radii
where it reduces the UV ﬂux at phase 0.78, in-
creases the depth of some absorption lines at φ =
0.78 − 0.81, and adds a red-shifted component
to absorption lines near φ = 0.78 − 0.91. The
overﬂowing material eventually falls back onto the
disk near phase 0.5 (as corroborated by Doppler
mapping Echevarr´ıa et al. (2007) and simulations
Kunze et al. (2001)) where it bounces back oﬀ the
disk and continues in a trajectory toward φ = 0.25.
At this phase the material is high enough above the
disk to veil the WD for a second time, creating a
second dip in the UV lightcurve as well deeper ab-
sorption lines in the spectrum.
