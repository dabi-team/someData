ABSTRACT
Kes 79 (G33.6+0.1) is an aspherical thermal composite supernova remnant (SNR) observed across
the electromagnetic spectrum and showing an unusual highly structured morphology, in addition to
harboring a central compact object (CCO). Using the CO J = 1–0, J = 2–1, and J = 3–2 data, we
provide the ﬁrst direct evidence and new morphological evidence to support the physical interaction
between the SNR and the molecular cloud in the local standard of rest velocity ∼ 105 km s−1. We
revisit the 380 ks XMM-Newton observations and perform a dedicated spatially resolved X-ray spec-
troscopic study with careful background subtraction. The overall X-ray-emitting gas is characterized
by an under-ionized (τc ∼ 6 × 1011 cm−3) cool (kTc ≈ 0.20 keV) plasma with solar abundances, plus
an under-ionized (τh ∼ 8 × 1010 cm−3) hot (kTh ≈ 0.80 keV) plasma with elevated Ne, Mg, Si, S and
Ar abundances. The X-ray ﬁlaments, spatially correlated with the 24 µm IR ﬁlaments, are suggested
to be due to the SNR shock interaction with dense gas, while the halo forms from SNR breaking out
into a tenuous medium. Kes 79 appears to have a double-hemisphere morphology viewed along the
symmetric axis. Projection eﬀect can explain the multiple-shell structures and the thermal composite
morphology. The high-velocity, hot (kTh ∼ 1.4–1.6 keV) ejecta patch with high metal abundances,
together with the non-uniform metal distribution across the SNR, indicates an asymmetric SN explo-
sion of Kes 79. We reﬁne the Sedov age to 4.4–6.7 kyr and the mean shock velocity to 730 km s−1.
Our multi-wavelength study suggests a progenitor mass of ∼ 15–20 solar masses for the core-collapse
explosion that formed Kes 79 and its CCO, PSR J1852+0040.

1. INTRODUCTION
Core-collapse supernova remnants (SNRs) are more or
less aspherical in their morphology (Lopez et al. 2011).
The asymmetries could be caused by external shaping
from non-uniform ambient medium (Tenorio-Tagle et al.
1985), the dense slow winds of progenitor stars (Blondin
et al. 1996), the runaway progenitors (Meyer et al. 2015),
and the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld (Gaensler 1998; West et
al. 2015). Intrinsic asymmetries of the explosion can also
impact on the morphologies of SNRs, with increasing ev-
idences provided by studying the distribution and physi-
cal states of the ejecta. The historical SNR Cas A shows
fast moving ejecta knots outside the main shell (e.g. , Fe-
sen & Gunderson 1996) and non-uniform distribution of
heavy elements (e.g. Hwang et al. 2000; 44Ti recently re-
ported by Grefenstette et al. 2014). High-velocity ejecta
“shrapnels” have been discovered in the evolved SNR
Vela (Aschenbach et al. 1995). The accumulating ob-
servations of asymmetric SNRs challenge the standard
spherical pictures of SN explosion and SNR evolution.
In light of this, the environmental and spatially resolved
study of asphercial SNRs becomes more and more im-
portant.

Kes 79 (a.k.a. G33.6+0.1) is a Galactic SNR with a

round western boundary and deformed eastern bound-
ary in radio band (Frail & Clifton 1989). The ra-
dio morphology is characterized by multiple concentric
shells or ﬁlaments (Velusamy et al. 1991). An early
ROSAT X-ray observation showed that most of the dif-
fuse X-ray emission is from a bright inner region and
some faint X-ray emission is extended to the outer re-
gion (Seward & Velusamy 1995). The 30 ks Chandra
observation revealed rich structures, such as many ﬁla-
ments and a “protrusion,” and a constant temperature
(0.7 keV) across the SNR (Sun et al. 2004; hereafter
S04). The spectral results of the global SNR were next
supported with the spectral study using two epochs of
XMM-Newton observations (Giacani et al. 2009). Us-
ing XMM-Newton observations spanning 2004 and 2009,
the spatially resolved studies provided further informa-
tion on the hot gas, where two thermal components are
required to explain the observed spectra (Auchettl et al.
2014, hereafter A14). Kes 79 hosts a central compact ob-
ject (CCO) PSR J1852+0040 (Seward et al. 2003), which
was discovered as a 105 ms X-ray pulsar (Gotthelf et al.
2005) with a weak magnetic ﬁeld (Halpern et al. 2007;
Halpern & Gotthelf 2010). In the south, an 11.56 s low-
B magnetar, 3XMM J185246.6+003317, was found at a
similar distance to Kes 79 (Zhou et al. 2014; Rea et al.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Zhou et al.

2014).

Kes 79 is classiﬁed as a thermal composite (or mixed-
morphology) SNR presenting a centrally ﬁlled morphol-
ogy in X-rays and shell-like in the radio band (Rho &
Petre 1998). Thermal composite SNRs generally dis-
play good correlation with H I or molecular clouds (MCs;
Rho & Petre 1998; Zhang et al. 2015) and γ-ray emis-
sion (check the SNR catalog1 in Ferrand & Saﬁ-Harb
2012), and are believed to be the best targets to study
hadronic cosmic rays. Green & Dewdney (1992) per-
formed 12CO J = 1–0 and HCO+ J = 1–0 observations
toward Kes 79 and found a morphological coincidence
of the SNR with the MCs in the east and southeast
at the local standard of rest (LSR) velocity (VLSR) of
105 km s−1. At this velocity, broad 1667 MHz OH ab-
sorption (Green 1989) and H I absorption were detected
(Frail & Clifton 1989). Green et al. (1997) reported the
detection of 1720 MHz OH line emission toward Kes 79,
although no OH maser was found. Hence, Kes 79 is very
likely interacting with MCs at around 105 km s−1, but
direct physical evidence is still lacking. The LSR velocity
corresponds to a kinetic distance of 7.1 kpc according to
the rotation curve of the Galaxy (Frail & Clifton 1989;
Case & Bhattacharya 1998). GeV γ-ray emission is also
detected with Fermi east of Kes 79 at a signiﬁcance of
∼ 7σ, where bright CO emission is present (A14).

In order to study the origin of asymmetries and ther-
mal composite morphology of Kes 79 and to ﬁnd physi-
cal evidence for the SNR–MC interaction, we performed
new multi-transition CO observations (see also Chen et
al. 2014) and revisited the XMM-Newton data. This pa-

Our results are shown in Section 3 and the discussion is
presented in Section 4. A summary is given in Section 5.

2. OBSERVATION
2.1. CO Observations
The observations of 12CO J = 1–0 (at 115.271 GHz)
and 13CO J = 1–0 (at 110.201 GHz) were taken during
2011 May with the 13.7 m millimeter-wavelength tele-
scope of the Purple Mountain Observatory at Delingha
(PMOD), China. The new Superconducting Spectro-
scopic Array Receiver with 3 × 3 beams was used as the
front end (Shan et al. 2012). The 12CO J = 1–0 and
13CO J = 1–0 lines were conﬁgured at at the upper and
lower sidebands, respectively, and observed simultane-
ously. The Fast Fourier Transform Spectrometers with
1 GHz bandwidth and 16,384 channels were used as the
back ends, providing a velocity resolution of 0.16 km s−1
for 12CO J = 1–0 and 0.17 km s−1 for 13CO J = 1–0.
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main
beam was 56′′, the main beam eﬃciency was 0.48 in the
observation epoch, and the pointing accuracy was bet-
ter than 4′′. We mapped a 30′ × 30′ region centered at
(18h52m40s, +00◦38′42′′, J2000) in on-the-ﬂy observing
mode. The data were then converted to 12CO J = 1–0
and 13CO J = 1–0 main-beam temperature (Tmb) cubes
with a grid spacing of 0.′5 and a velocity resolution of 0.5
km s−1. The corresponding mean rms of the spectra in
each pixel is 0.41 K and 0.26 K per channel, respectively.

The 12CO J = 2–1 (at 230.538 GHz ) obser-
in 2010 Jan-
vation of Kes 79 was carried out
uary with K¨olner Observatory for Submillimeter As-
tronomy (KOSMA; now renamed CCOSMA). We
mapped an 18′ × 16′ area centered at (18h52m35s,
+00◦39′12′′, J2000) with a grid spacing of 1′ using a
superconductor–insulator–superconductor receiver and a
medium-resolution acousto-optical spectrometer. The
FWHM of the main beam was 130′′ and the velocity
resolution was 0.21 km s−1 at 230 GHz. The main beam
eﬃciency was 68%.

We retrieve the 12CO J = 3–2 (at 345.796 GHz) data of
Kes 79 from the CO High Resolution Survey (Dempsey
et al. 2013) observed with Heterodyne Array Receiver
Program (HARP) on board the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT). The ﬁrst release of the survey covers
|b| ≤ 0.◦5 between 10.◦25 < l < 17.◦5, and |b| ≤ 0.◦25 be-
tween 17.◦5 < l < 50.◦25. The FWHM of the main beam
at the frequency was 14′′, and the main beam eﬃciency
was 0.63. We use the rebinned data, which has a pixel
size of 6′′ and a velocity resolution 1 km s−1.

The J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 data were reduced with the
GILDAS/CLASS package.2 For the data analysis and vi-
sualization, we made use of the Miriad (Sault et al. 1995),
KARMA (Gooch 1996) and IDL software packages.

2.2. The XMM-Newton and Spitzer Data
There are 21 archival XMM-Newton observations to-
ward Kes 79, which were taken in 2004 (PI: F. Se-
ward), 2006-2007 (PI: E. Gotthelf), and 2008-2009
(PI: J. Halpern). We excluded ﬁve observations (Obs.
ID: 550671401,550671501, 55061601, 55061701, and
55062001) since they were performed with ﬁlter cal-
closed (aﬀected by radiation) and observation 550671101
suﬀered from ﬂares for most of the observation time. We
use EPIC-MOS data which covered the whole SNR in
full frame mode with medium ﬁlter, while EPIC-pn data
are not used here since the pn detector only covered the
inner part the remnant in small window mode.

The EPIC-MOS data were reduced using the Science
Analysis System software (SAS3). We used the XMM-
Newton Extended Source Analysis Software, XMM-
ESAS, in the SAS package to ﬁlter out the time intervals
with soft proton contaminations, detect point sources in
the ﬁeld of view, and create particle background images.
After removing time intervals with heavy proton ﬂarings,
the total eﬀective exposures are 376 ks and 380 ks for
MOS1 and MOS2, respectively. Detailed information,
including the observation ID, observing date, and net
exposure of the observations, is summarized in Table 1.
We retrieve Spitzer 24 µm post-basic calibrated data
from the Spitzer archive. The mid-IR observation was
performed as a 24 Micron Survey of the Inner Galactic
Disk Program (PID: 20597; PI: S. Carey).

Kes 79 has been suggested to expand into the denser
ISM in the east, since the eastern radio shells are de-
formed and has a prominent protrusion in the northeast
(Velusamy et al. 1991). Previous CO J = 1–0 observa-
tions showed that the SNR morphology is correlated with
the eastern molecular gas at VLSR ∼ 105 km s−1 (Green
& Dewdney 1992). In this paper, we present the direct
kinematic evidence with multiple transitions of CO.

We ﬁrst search for morphological coincidences between
the CO emission and the SNR shells, especially for the
deformed eastern and northeastern shells, which might
be shaped by dense ambient medium. Figure 1 displays
the channel maps of PMOD 12CO J = 1–0 in the ve-
locity ranges of 4–124 km s−1 with a velocity step of
6 km s−1. Each channel shows the velocity-integrated

the upper-left panel, we deﬁne several radio shells (also
referring to the deﬁnition in S04), which will be used
for multi-wavelength comparison in the following study.
Located on the inner Galactic plane, the sky region of
Kes 79 is rich in molecular gas in its line of sight. There
is bright 12CO emission in the eastern and northeastern
shells in the velocity range 100–112 km s−1, as noted by
Green & Dewdney (1992), while the CO emission fades
out to the northwest. We also notice that a molecular
shell at ∼ 115 km s−1 spatially matches the SNR’s mid-
dle and outer radio shells in the west, and the inner radio
shell in the east. At VLSR ∼ 35 km s−1 and ∼ 49 km s−1,
the MCs are spatially close to the eastern double shell
of the remnant as well; however, the gas does not match
the deformed northeastern shell. The CO emission at
other velocities is either outside the SNR or revealing
complicated morphology inside the remnant. The open
H I shell detected in the north and west at ∼ 95 km s−1
(Giacani et al. 2009), however, seems to not correspond

to shell structure of CO emission. From both the mor-
phology and the spectral lines, we cannot ﬁnd a signal
for MC–SNR interaction below 95 km s−1.

The JCMT high-resolution observations

in the
12CO J = 3–2 line (with beamwidth of 14′′ and pixel
size of 6′′) provide more details on the gas morphology
and can be compared with the VLA 20 cm continuum
data with a synthesis beam size of 14′′ × 7′′. Since the
12CO J = 3–2 transition has a relatively high critical
density of 4 × 104(T /33 K)−0.5 cm−3 and a high upper
state temperature of 33 K (Sch¨oier et al. 2005), it can
trace dense and warm gas better than 12CO J = 1–0, and
thus help to reveal shocked gas. Figure 2 shows HARP
12CO J = 3–2 channel maps in the velocity interval 88–
118 km s−1, overlaid with the 20 cm radio continuum
contours. The velocity step of the channels is 2 km s−1
and the maps cover a 24′ × 24′ area. The brightest
12CO J = 3–2 emission is shown near the northeast radio
protrusion, and along the eastern double shell. Notably,
at VLSR ∼ 105 km s−1, two thin, clumpy 12CO J = 3–2
ﬁlaments mainly align with the boundary of the eastern
double shell, indicating a relation between the dense and
warm molecular ﬁlaments and the eastern double-shell.
We also found that the 12CO J = 3–2 emission shifts
from the northeast to the west with increasing velocity
(up to 115 km s−1).

Broad molecular line broadening or asymmetric pro-
ﬁle is an evidence of shock perturbation of molecular
gas (e.g., Denoyer 1979; Chen et al. 2014). A broad
12CO J = 3–2 line is found in the bright clump at the
southern boundary of the radio protrusion (18h52m58s58,
00◦42′29′′95, J2000; with size of ∼ 30′′ and denoted by an
arrow in Figure 2). As shown in Figure 3, the spectrum
consists of a sharp peak at 103 km s−1 and a broad wing
spanning a velocity range over 20 km s−1, which cannot

ﬁnd that the proﬁle can be well described by two Gaus-
sian components: a narrow line with line width (FWHM)
∆v ≈ 2 km s−1 at VLSR ≈ 103.3 km s−1; and a broad line
with ∆v ≈ 12 km s−1 at VLSR ≈ 104.4 km s−1. The nar-
row line corresponds to the dense, quiescent gas, while
the broad component is probably emitted by the shocked

gas. The broad 12CO J = 3–2 line detected at the pro-
trusion position, together with the morphological agree-
ment between the two molecular ﬁlaments in the east
and the radio double shell, supports that the systemic
velocity of Kes 79 is at ∼ 105 km s−1.

We subsequently search for shocked molecular gas over
the entire SNR. Figure 4 shows a grid of line proﬁles

the 75–125 km s−1 velocity range across the whole SNR.
The radio image is displayed as a background. Due to a
low abundance of 13CO in the interstellar molecular gas
([13CO]/[H2] ∼ 2×10−6; Dickman 1978), the 13CO emis-
sion is normally optically thin and traces the quiescent
gas. The molecular gas shocked by the SNR may show
asymmetric or broad 12CO lines deviating from the line
proﬁles of 13CO. The 13CO emission associated with the
SNR peaks at VLSR ∼ 105 km s−1 across the remnant. In
the western hemisphere of the remnant, the 12CO lines
shift to higher velocity (red-shift) relative to the 13CO
line peaks. The 12CO line proﬁles in the northeast of the

a higher mean velocity than the systemic velocity given
by the 13CO emission in the west. Notably, the high-VLSR
12CO emission delineates the outer, middle, and the east-
ern inner radio shells, suggesting this high-VLSR emission
is excited by the shock at the SNR shells.

We merged the data of the 15 EPIC-MOS observations
and show a tri-color image of Kes 79 in Figure 6(a),
in which the X-ray emission in the soft (0.3–1.2 keV),
medium (1.2–2.0 keV), and hard (2.0–7.0 keV) bands
is colored red, green, and blue, respectively. The en-
ergy bands are chosen to obtain similar counts in these
images. Each of the three band images was exposure-
corrected and adaptively smoothed with a Gaussian ker-
nel to achieve a minimum signiﬁcance of 3 and a max-
imum signiﬁcance of 4 using the “csmooth” command

in CIAO.4 The X-ray emission of Kes 79 is highly ﬁl-
amentary and clumpy.
In the east, two striking X-ray
ﬁlaments are distorted and composed of with a string
of small X-ray clumps in scale of less than 15′′ (0.5 pc
at a distance of 7.1 kpc). The V-shaped structure in
the southern part appears to be the softest X-ray emit-
ter (due to its relatively red color).
In the SNR inte-
rior, two jet-like ﬁlaments stretch from the southeast to
the northwest and across the CCO. Near the northwest-
ern end, there is a patch of hard X-ray emission, which
is discussed in Section 4.3. The two compact sources,
the magnetar 3XMM J185246.6+003317 and the CCO
PSR J1852+0040, are located in the south and the cen-
ter of the SNR, respectively.

The Spitzer 24 µm IR image reveals many thin ﬁla-
ments inside the remnant which are well matched with
the bright X-ray ﬁlaments (see Figure 6b). Here we use
the unsharp mask IR image5 instead of the original emis-
sion image in order to highlight the sharp structures.

In ﬁgure 6d, we compare the distribution of the high-
VLSR MCs (110–120 km s−1; above the system velocity
105 km s−1; green) with that of the SNR’s X-ray (blue)
and radio (red) emission. A molecular arc delineates the
western outer radio shell and conﬁnes the bright X-ray
emission in the SNR interior. Meanwhile, a northeast-
south oriented molecular ridge also spatially matches the
bright X-ray ﬁlaments and eastern inner radio emission.

3.2.2. X-Ray Halo
A faint X-ray halo surrounding the ﬁlamentary struc-
tures appears to stretch to the outer radio boundary,
as shown in the 0.3–7.0 keV X-ray image (Figure 6(c)).
The X-ray image was exposure-corrected, smoothed with
a Gaussian kernel of 3.′3, and overlaid with contours of
the 20 cm radio continuum emission. Here we display the
X-ray image with a histogram equalization scale to high-
light the faint emission. Unlike the ﬁlaments, the faint

4 http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao
5 We ﬁrst produce a smoothed (with a Gaussian kernel of 6.′′26),
or unsharp, image as a positive mask. The mask is then inverted,
scaled, and added to the original image. The resulted image will
increase the sharpness or contrast.

X-ray halo has no evident IR counterpart. The proper-
ties of the X-ray halo and the ﬁlaments will be compared
in Section 3.3.

We investigate the distribution of metal lines ﬁrstly by
using the EW images of Mg Heα at ∼ 1.34 keV, Si Heα
at ∼ 1.85 keV, S Heα at ∼ 2.45 keV, and Ar Heα at ∼ 3.1
keV (see Figure 7). The EW of an emission line is deﬁned
as EW = R Il(E)dE/Ic, where R Il(E)dE and Ic are the
energy-integrated intensity of the line component and the
intensity of the underlying continuum at the line center,
respectively. The EW values of metal lines depend on
the abundances, and are also aﬀected by the temperature
and ionization states.

We deﬁne the energy bands of the lines, and the left
and right continuum shoulders as shown in Table 2, ac-
cording to the global spectra of Kes 79 (see Section 3.3.2
below). The continuum emission of each line is estimated
by interpolating the left and right shoulders’ emission.
The background of each image is subtracted before pro-
ducing the EW map. The quiescent particle background
(QPB) is ﬁrst subtracted from each image since it is ap-
parently spatially variant at ∼ 1.49 keV and ∼ 1.74 keV,
which would aﬀect the EWs of the Mg and Si lines.
The QPB images are created from the ﬁlter-wheel closed
(FWC) data with the XMM-ESAS software. We then
estimate the local background level from a region near
the remnant and subtract it from the QPB-subtracted
image of each band. We adaptively bin the background-
subtracted EW images with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)
≈ 5 by applying the weighted Voronoi tessellations bin-
ning algorithm (Diehl & Statler 2006), which is a gener-
alization of Cappellari & Copin’s (2003) Voronoi binning
algorithm. The bins with S/N< 4 and low continuum
ﬂuxes were set to zero.

3.2.3. Equivalent Width (EW) Images of Metal Species
The EWs of the Mg line are nearly uniform across the
remnant. Here the Mg Heα line’s soft shoulder is strongly
aﬀected by the variation of the interstellar absorption,
which could also bring uncertainties to the estimation of
the continuum.

Asymmetric distribution is clearly revealed in both

EW images of Si and S. The largest EW values are found
in a patch in the northwest. Generally, the EWs at the
X-ray ﬁlaments are larger than those in the faint halo re-
gions. A similar trend can also be found in the EW map
of Ar. The asymmetric EW distribution of the metal
lines suggests that the hot gas properties (abundances,
temperature, or ionization states) are not uniform in the
SNR. The halo and ﬁlamentary regions may not be in
the same physical states, as conﬁrmed below according
to the spectral analysis.

3.3. XMM-Newton Spectral Analysis
3.3.1. Spectral Extraction and Background Subtraction

The & 375 ks XMM-Newton observations allow us to
quantitatively investigate the hot gas in small-scale re-
gions in Kes 79. We deﬁne source (on-SNR) and back-
ground (oﬀ-SNR) regions for spectral analysis after re-
moving the central bright X-ray source PSR J1852+0040
by excluding a circular region with a radius of 30′′ cen-
tered at (18h52m38s522, 00◦40′20′′89, J2000) (see Fig-
ure 8). We select a large region with a radius of 5.′5 that
covers the whole SNR, 14 small regions for the bright
ﬁlamentary structures (“f1–14”) and 5 smaller regions
(“c”, “mE”, “mW”, “oW”, and “oN”) for the faint halo
gas. The background region “bg” is selected from the
nearby sky with the same Galactic latitude as that of
the remnant to minimize contamination by the Galactic

ridge emission.

We apply a double-subtraction method that takes into
account vignetting eﬀects and the spatially variable in-
strumental background as follows: (1) subtract respec-
tive instrumental background contribution from the raw
on- and oﬀ-SNR spectra by using the FWC data of

MOS1; (2) construct a background model by ﬁtting the
oﬀ-SNR spectra (instrumental background-subtracted),
which is subsequently normalized by area and added to
the source model to describe the on-SNR spectra. FWC
data are selected in the epochs close to those of the source
observations in order to reduce variation of instrumental
background. Using the task addascaspec in HEASOFT,
we merged the spectra taken within two months to in-
crease the statistical quality for the hard X-ray band.
Hence, the spectra of the two 2004 observations, ﬁve
2008 observations, and six 2009 observations are merged
respectively. Finally, the 10 source spectra (5 MOS1 plus
5 MOS2 spectra taken from the 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008,
and 2009 observations) for each on-SNR region are then
instrumental background-subtracted and binned to reach
an S/N of > 4 in the following joint-ﬁt. We only use
the six oﬀ-SNR spectra (region “bg”; 3 MOS1 plus 3
MOS2) taken in 2004, 2006 and 2008 to construct the

sian kernel of 3. The solid regions colored in blue, red, and black
are deﬁned for spectral extraction of the whole SNR, the ﬁlaments,

background model, since the region “bg” was at the un-
usable CCD of MOS1 during the observations in 2007
and 2009.

XSPEC (version 12.9) is used for spectral ﬁtting.
The spectra in the oﬀ-SNR region “bg” is phenomeno-
logically described with an absorbed nei+power-law
plus an unabsorbed bremsstrahlung + gaussian model
(χ2
ν/d.o.f = 1.33/231; see Figure 9). The on-SNR sky
background is determined by normalizing the model ac-
cording to the region sizes.

3.3.2. The Global Spectra
Figure 9 shows the spectra extracted from source re-
gion “SNR” (upper) and background region “bg” (bot-
tom; normalized by area). The global spectra of the SNR
in 0.5–8 keV reveals distinct He-like lines of Mg (∼ 1.34
keV), Si (∼ 1.85 keV and ∼ 2.19 keV), S (∼ 2.45 keV),
and Ar (∼ 3.1 keV), and several faint H-like lines of Ne
at 0.9 keV and S at 2.9 keV.

We ﬁrst applied an absorbed non-equilibrium ioniza-
tion (NEI) model (plus the background model with ﬁxed
values) to jointly ﬁt the 10 source spectra in 0.5-8.0 keV.
For the foreground absorption, we used the tbabs model
with the Anders & Grevesse (1989) abundances and pho-
toelectric cross-section from Balucinska-Church & Mc-
Cammon (1992). The NEI model vnei (NEI version
3.0 in XSPEC) is ﬁrstly applied, with the abundances
of Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Fe (the abundance of Ni is
tied to Fe) in the models allowed to vary in the spec-

tral ﬁt. Here vnei describes an NEI plasma with single
and uniform ionization parameters. However, the single
NEI model fails to describe the spectra in the hard X-
ray band (χ2
ν /d.o.f = 2.98/2657) as also pointed out by
A14. The elevated tail of the observed spectra compared
to the model above 3 keV is also seen in single thermal
model spectral ﬁttings in previous studies (e.g. S04, and
Giacani et al. 2009), implying that the global spectrum
of Kes 79 should contain more than one component.

Since some thermal composite SNRs show recombining
plasma, we tried an absorbed recombining plasma model
(vrnei in XSPEC) to ﬁt the spectra. However, the spec-
tral ﬁt (χ2
ν/d.o.f = 2.96/2656) gives an initial plasma
temperature (0.12 keV) much smaller than the current
plasma temperature (0.75 keV), suggesting that the gas
is under-ionized rather than over-ionized.

An absorbed nei+vnei model is subsequently used,
which substantially improves the spectral ﬁt (χ2
ν /d.o.f =
1.92/2654; see Table 3 for the spectral ﬁt results and Fig-
ure 9 for the spectra). The abundance of the cool com-
ponent is set to solar since variable abundance does not
apparently improve the spectral ﬁt. The model is still
not good enough to reproduce the spectra, especially in
the 1-3 keV band, which suggests that the physical prop-
erties of the X-ray emitting gas are not uniform across
the remnant. However, the two-temperature model, to
some extent, provides us with general properties of the
hot plasma.

According to the nei+vnei model, the X-rays from
the remnant suﬀers an interstellar absorption NH =
1.71 × 1022 cm−2 and the X-ray-emitting plasma can
be roughly described as under-ionized two-temperature
gas. The cool phase of the gas has a temperature
kTc = 0.19 keV, an ionization timescale τc = ne,cti,c =
6.4 ± 0.4 × 1011 cm−3 s , and solar abundances (so
ﬁxed to 1), while the hot phase has a temperature
kTh = 0.80 keV, an ionization timescale τh = ne,hti,h =
8.1 ± 0.1 × 1010 cm−3 s and enriched metal abundances
([Ne]/[Ne]⊙ = 1.83 ± 0.05, [Mg]/[Mg]⊙ = 1.56 ± 0.03,

[S]/[S]⊙ = 1.40 ± 0.02, and [Ar]/[Ar]⊙ = 1.8 ± 0.1).

The column density (inferred from the tbabs model) is
larger than that obtained by S04 (1.54±0.5×1022 cm−2,
phabs model) and Giacani et al. (2009; 1.52 ± 0.02 ×
1022 cm−2, phabs model), but smaller than that reported
by A14 (2.43 ± 0.05 × 1022 cm−2; tbabs model). Some
other spectral ﬁt results, such as kTc and abundances,
are also diﬀerent from those obtained by A14. We believe
that the background selection is the main reason for the
discrepancy between our work and A14. In particular,
some of the background regions selected by A14 are well
inside the SNR where halo X-ray emission is present (see
Figure 6c in this paper in comparison to Figure 3 in A14).
We assume that the two-temperature gas ﬁlls the
whole volume (fc + fh = 1) and is in pressure bal-
ance (ncTc = nhTh), where f and n are the ﬁll-
ing factor and hydrogen density (n = 1.2ne), respec-
tively. The subscripts “c” and “h” denote the param-
eters for the cool and hot phases, respectively. The
nei+vnei ﬁt results (see Table 3) give an emission mea-

and d7.1 is the distance scaled to 7.1 kpc. The cool

3.3.3. Spatially resolved spectroscopy

The X-ray image of Kes 79 (see Figure 6a) has revealed
a non-uniform nature of the hot gas. The EW maps of
metal lines (Figure 7) also indicate a nonuniform distri-
bution of the ejecta. The gas properties are thus ex-
pected to be spatially variant, and the global spectra
may not be well described with a simple one-component
or two-component model. We thus compare the spectral
analysis results of the 19 deﬁned small regions to inves-
tigate the variation of gas properties across the SNR.

A two-component thermal model is needed to describe
the spectra well for the 19 small-scale regions. Adding
an extra model to a single thermal model is also feasible
according to the F-test null hypothesis probabilities. We
ﬁrst use nei(soft)+ vnei(hard) to ﬁt the spectra, and
then replace nei with apec (APEC thermal model de-
scribing the plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium;
ATOMDB version 3.0.2) for the cool phase if its ioniza-
tion timescale reaches higher than ∼ 1013 cm−3 s. Here
we allow the Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Fe abundances of
the hot component to vary as long as they can be well
constrained. The abundance of the cool component is
set to solar since variable abundance does not appar-
ently improve the spectral ﬁt. The best-ﬁt results for
the nei/apec+vnei model are tabulated in Table 3.6

6 We also tried the pshock/apec+vpshock model for a com-
parison, where pshock is a plane-parallel shock plasma model
with a range of ionization parameters and solar abundances, while

The interstellar column density NH of the X-ray emis-
sion varies from ∼ 1.5 × 1022 cm−2 in the south to
∼ 2.0 × 1022 cm−2 in the northwest, consistent with the
fact that the southern portion emits softer X-rays (as
shown in Figure 6a). Generally, both the bright ﬁla-
mentary (except regions “f5”, “f10” and “f11”) and faint
halo gas hold spectral properties similar to the global
SNR gas, including the temperature of the cool phase
(kTc ∼ 0.2 keV), and the temperature (kTh ∼ 0.7–
1.0 keV), ionization timescale (τh = 6–12 × 1010 cm−3 s),
and metal abundances of the hot phase. Nevertheless,
there is a trend that the gas near the SNR edge has lower
kTh (∼ 0.7 keV) than in the SNR center (∼ 0.9 keV).

To estimate the density of the plasma, we assume sev-
eral three-dimensional shapes for the two-dimensional re-
gions: (1) oblate spheroids for the elliptical regions “f1–
12”; (2) oblate cylinders for the rectangular regions “f13–
14”; (3) sections of spherical layers for the shell-like halo
regions “mW” and “oW”; 4) for the halo regions “c”,
“mE” and “oN”, the volumes are expressed as V = S × l;
where S is the area of the region and l is the line of
sight length along the SNR sphere (depending on the
distance of the region to the SNR center). We assume
that fc + fh = 1 and ncTc = nhTh, similar to the calcu-
lation for the global gas. The calculated densities of the
two-phase gas are summarized in Table 3.

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Multi-wavelength Manifestation of the SNR-MC

Interaction

4.1.1. Molecular environment
Using the multi-transition CO observations, we have
provided kinematic and new morphological evidence to
support the scenario that Kes 79 is interacting with MCs
at a systemic LSR velocity of ∼ 105 km s−1.

The column density and mass of the surrounding
molecular gas can be estimated by using the 13CO J = 1–
0 lines spanning the velocity range of 95–115 km s−1. As-
suming that the rotational levels of the 13CO molecules
are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we obtain the
column density of 13CO molecules as follows (Kawamura
et al. 1998):

N (13CO) = 2.42×1014 τ (13CO)∆v( km s−1)Tex( K)

1 − exp(−5.29 K/Tex)

cm−2,

(1)
where Tex and ∆v are the excitation temperature and
line width of 13CO J = 1–0, respectively. When the
13CO lines are optically thin (optical depth τ (13CO) ≪
1), the main beam brightness temperature of 13CO
is Tmb ≈ Texτ (13CO). Considering that Tmb∆v ≈
R Tmb(v)dv and taking the N (H2) to N (13CO) ratio as
5 × 105 (Dickman 1978), we obtain the column density
of H2:

vpshock has variable abundances. The two models result in almost
identical temperature and abundance values, with larger NH and
τh obtained with the latter model. The larger τh value is inter-
pretable given that in vpshock it stands for the upper limit of the
ionization scale while in vnei a single ionization scale is adopted.
In this paper, we use the ﬁt results of the nei/apec+vnei model
because it is based on a simpler uniform assumption and generally
provides a good characterization of the gas’s general properties.

A typical MCs temperature of 10 K is adopted here for
Tex, which is also close to the peak main beam tempera-
ture of 12CO J = 1–0 lines in the vicinity of Kes 79 (see
Figure 4). The 13CO emission integrated in the velocity
range 95–115 km s−1 (associated with the SNR) is then
used to derive the N (H2) and the distribution of N (H2)
near the remnant is revealed in Figure 10.

The mass of the environmental molecular gas in the
22′ × 22′ (or 45.4d7.1 pc ×45.4d7.1 pc) region (ﬁeld
of view in Figure 10),
is obtained to be Mmol =
7.1 × 104 M⊙, where the mean
µmH P[N (H2)L2] ∼ 5.7d2
molecular weight µ = 2.8, mH is the mass of the hydro-
gen atom, and L is the size of the gas (45.4d7.1 pc). The
size and mass values of the cloud is typical for giant MCs
(GMCs; Dame et al. 2001). The mean molecular density
of the GMC can be estimated as n(H2) ∼ N (H2)/L ∼
30d−1
7.1 cm−3, where N (H2) is the mean column density.

4.1.2. Origin of the Mid-IR and X-Ray Filaments
A good spatial correlation is present between the mid-
IR ﬁlaments and the X-ray ﬁlaments (see Figure 6). Pre-
vious IR studies toward middle-age SNRs summarized
three main origins of the emission at the Spitzer 24 µm
band: (1) continuum emission of dust grains (e.g., An-
dersen et al. 2011); (2) atomic lines such as [Fe II] at
25.988 µm and [O IV] at 25.890 µm (e.g., Reach & Rho
2000), and (3) molecular lines such as the vibrational ro-
tational line of H2 at 28.2 µm (e.g., Neufeld et al. 2007).
The IR emission at & 15 µm is usually dominated by
the continuum of dust grains with typical temperature
∼ 40–100 K (Seok et al. 2013), while at the shorter wave-
lengths, the IR emission of SNRs can be dominated by
ionic/molecular lines (e.g., IC 443, Cesarsky et al. 1999;
3C 391, Reach et al. 2002). The warm dust could be

heated by either collisions or radiation. In the collisions
case, the swept-up dust grains are collisionally heated by
the electrons in the hot plasma (Dwek 1987), which re-
sults in a good spatial correlation between the IR and
X-ray emission. The dust grains could also be heated by
the UV photons from the postshock gas in the radiative
shock (Hollenbach & McKee 1979), which may be eﬃ-
cient for the SNRs interacting with MCs. Considering
the MC–IR-X–ray correlation revealed in Kes 79 (Fig-
ure 6), the two cases may both work here. The SNR
has been considered to be in the Sedov phase of evo-
lution (S04; see also discussion in Section 4.2) and no
optical emission has been detected to support the radia-
tive shock scenario (could possibly be due to heavy ab-
sorption). However, small-scale radiative shock in MCs
cannot be excluded. Since the IR emission is ﬁlamen-
tary and a strong IR-X-ray correlation is widely seen in
the whole remnant (see Figure 6b), it is more likely that
the 24 µm emission comes from dust heated by the hot
plasma. Further IR spectroscopic observations are re-
quired to provide a ﬁrm conclusion.

The most prominent IR ﬁlaments emerge in the east-

tion with the X-ray structures, including the enhance-

two ﬁlaments in the eastern part of the SNR revealed
in 12CO J = 3–2, 24 µm, and the 0.3–7.0 keV X-ray
bands. The three bands correspond to three hierachical
gas phases: cold dense gas, warm gas/dust, and hot ten-
uous plasma. There is a trend wherein the colder gas
is located east of the hotter gas. In particular, the thin
IR ﬁlaments with a width of 6′′ (0.2 pc at a distance of
7.1 kpc) are just east of the X-ray ﬁlaments (∼ 15′′). The
trend is consistent with a scenario where the shock is in-
teracting with multi-phase ISM in the east, which then
generates diﬀerent types of shocks. The shock is damped
while it propagates into denser medium. The fast shocks
heat the moderate-density cloudlet (nc ∼ 6 cm−3) to
a temperature of kTc ∼ 0.2 keV and the low-density
inter-cloud medium (nh ∼ 1–2 cm−3) to a tempera-
ture of kTh ∼ 0.7 keV (see Table 3). The nondissocia-
tive shock transmitted into the dense molecular clumps
(> 104 cm−3 for the clumps emitting 12CO J = 3–2 emis-
sion) has a low velocity (. 50 km s−1, Draine & Mckee
1993) and generates the broad/asymmetric 12CO lines.
Therefore, the multiple shocks in clumpy ISM explains
the bright ﬁlamentary radiation in multi-wavelengths.

The interior X-ray ﬁlaments probably arise from SNR
interaction with relatively dense gas (∼ 4–13 cm−3 for
the cold component), as compared to the low density of
the halo gas (∼ 1–2 cm−3 for the cold component; see
Table 3).

4.1.3. Projection Eﬀects

Kes 79 was classiﬁed as a mixed-morphology or ther-
mal composite SNR (Rho & Petre 1998), as its bright-
est X-ray emission arises from the interior and the radio
emission is shell-like, Diﬀerent from most other thermal
composite-type SNRs, which have a smooth, centrally
ﬁlled X-ray morphology, Kes 79 has a highly structured
X-ray morphology, and the interior X-ray and radio emis-
sion are correlated (see Figure 6). As S04 note, the inner
X-ray shell and outer X-ray halo have clear-cut edges and
may both come from shock surfaces.
In Section 4.1.2,
we have provided evidence that the X-ray and IR ﬁla-
ments, and the radio shells in the SNR interior result
from the interaction of the shock with a dense medium.
Hence, projection eﬀect is the most plausible origin of
the multiple-shell structure mixed-morphology nature.

Kes 79 may have a double-hemisphere morphology
viewed essentially along the symmetric axis.
SNRs
breaking out from an MC into a low-density region can
produce such a double-hemisphere morphology as pre-
dicted by hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Tenorio-Tagle
et al. 1985; Cho et al. 2015). There are a number of
SNRs showing such double-hemisphere morphology due
to shock breaking out from a dense medium, such as
IC 443 (e.g., Troja et al. 2006), W28 (e.g., Dubner et
al. 2000), 3C391 (e.g., Reynolds & Moﬀett 1993, Chen
et al. 2004), VRO 42.05.01 (e.g., Pineault et al. 1987),
G349.7+0.2 (e.g., Lazendic et al. 2005), etc. All of these
SNRs are associated with MCs (see Jiang et al. 2010
and references therein). Here we suggest that Kes 79 is
among the group of double-hemisphere SNRs interact-

ing with MCs. The bright ﬁlaments correspond to the
smaller hemisphere (radius R1 ∼ 4′) evolving into the
denser ISM, while the shock breaking out in a tenuous
medium forms a larger hemisphere (radius R2 ∼ 6′) ﬁlled
with hot halo gas. The larger hemisphere or the blow-
out part is the blueshifted one essentially heading toward
us. This picture can be conﬁrmed based on the distribu-
tion of the foreground absorption, NH, and the molecular
line analysis. As summarized in Table 3, NH is lowest in
the southeast (“f5” and “mE”) and southwest (“f6” and
“mW”) of the remnant. Since the column density of MC
at these regions can reach as high as ∼ 1022 cm−2 (see
Figure 10), heavy absorption would have been present if
the MCs were in the foreground. Hence, we suggest a
picture where most of the molecular gas (except that in
the east) is behind the larger hemisphere (halo gas) and
the X-ray ﬁlaments correspond to the SNR–dense-gas in-
teracting regions. This scenario is also in agreement with
the 12CO shell being red-shifted due to shock perturba-
tion (VLSR = 110-120 km s−1; see the detailed description
in Section 3.1).

4.2. Global evolution parameters
Most small-scale regions have temperatures kTc and
kTh similar to those of the global gas (see Table 3),
while the ﬁlling factors fc could be varying across
the remnant. Hence, the overall spectral results can
represent the average properties of the SNR’s X-ray-
emitting plasma. The masses for the cool and hot phases
−4(fc/0.62)1/2d5/2
(M = 1.4nHmHV ) are 277+7
7.1 M⊙ and
42±1(fh/0.38)1/2d5/2
7.1 M⊙, respectively. Both masses are
too high to be produced by the SN ejecta, and are most
likely due to the shock-heated ISM. The enriched S and
Ar in the hot component indicates that part of the mass
in the hot phase must be also contributed by the ejecta.
Hence, the hot phase with lower density (0.5 cm−3) and
elevated metal abundances is related to the emission in
the inter-cloud medium, while the cool phase with higher
density (2 cm−3) and solar abundances is suggested to
come from the shocked denser cloud.

We use the parameters of the hot phase gas to in-
vestigate the SNR evolution in the inter-cloud medium.
The bright X-ray emission and low ionization age (ti ∼
4.2 kyr) for the hot component suggest that Kes 79
has not yet entered radiative phase (at least globally).
Hence, we adopt the Sedov evolutionary phase (Se-
dov 1959) for Kes 79 as done in previous studies of
the remnant (e.g. S04 and A14). Adopting kTh =
0.80 ± 0.01 keV as the emission measure weighted tem-
perature for the whole remnant, the post-shock temper-
ature can be estimated as kTs = kTh/1.27 (for ion–
electron equipartition; Borkowski et al. 2001), which
is 0.63 ± 0.01 keV. The shock velocity can be derived
as vs = [16kTs/(3µmH)]1/2 = 727 ± 5 km s−1, where
µ = 0.61 the mean atomic weight for fully ionized
plasma. Taking the curvature radius of the western shell
R2 = 12.4d7.1 pc (6′), we estimate the explosion energy
as E = (25/4ξ)(1.4n0mH)R3
7.1 erg,
where ξ = 2.026 and the preshock diﬀuse gas density
n0 = nh/4 ∼ 0.13 cm−3. The Sedov age of the remnant
is estimated as t = 2Rs/(5vs) ≈ 6.7 kyr. The real age
might deviate from 6.7 kyr to some extent because of the

non-spherical evolution of Kes 79. Varying Rs between
R1 (∼ 4′) and R2 (∼ 6′) gives an age range between 4.4–
6.7 kyr. The lower limit 4.4 kyr is close to the ionization
age of the hot component (4.2 kyr).

4.3. High-velocity Ejecta Fragment(s)
The asymmetric metal distribution in Kes 79 is sup-
ported by both the EW maps of Si and S (see Figure 7)
and the spatially resolved spectral results (see Table 3).
Notably, a bright patch is revealed in the Si and S EW
maps. The northwestern regions “f11”, “f10” have a dis-
tinctly higher kTh and abundances compared to other ﬁl-
amentary regions. The regions overlap the bright patch
in the EW maps of Si and S.

−1.0), Si (5.2+2.2

The metal-rich patch mainly corresponds to the spec-
tral extraction region “f11” at 18h52m25s4, 00◦41′45′′5
(J2000), where the hot component gas has a high kTh (=
−0.3 keV) and the largest abundances of Ne (4.4+3.5

−2.2),
−1.1) and Ar (4.2+2.4
−1.3), S (5.2+1.8
Mg (3.6+1.7
−1.8).
The patch is a protrusion of the ﬁlaments in the north-
west (see Figure 6a) and may be an ejecta fragment
or a conglomeration of ejecta fragments at a high ve-
locity. Using the hot component temperature (kTh =
1.6+0.6
−0.3 keV), the velocity of the fragment is estimated
−0.1 × 103 km s−1,
to be vej = [16kTh/(3µmH)]1/2 = 1.0+0.2
which is 41% faster than the mean shock velocity ∼
730 km s−1 derived in Section 4.2. In the opposite direc-
tion, the plasma in region “f5” has a high temperature
(kTh = 1.4+0.3
−0.2 keV; about twice the average value) and
−0.4 × 1010 cm−3 s)
a lower ionization timescale (τh = 2.3+0.5
in the hot component, while the metal abundances are
not signiﬁcantly elevated. The gas in region “f5” thus
could be fast ejecta clump well mixed with the ambient
medium.

The non-uniform distribution of metal species in
Kes 79 and the presence of high-velocity ejecta frage-
ment(s) reﬂect the intrinsic asymmetries of the SN ex-
plosion.

4.4. Constraints on the progenitor
Kes 79 hosts a CCO, PSR J1852+0040, which is strong
evidence of core-collapse explosion. Therefore, its pro-
genitor is a massive (& 8 M⊙) star born in the MCs.
During its short lifetime (∼ 106–107 years in the main-
sequence stage; Schaller et al. 1992), the massive progen-
itor launches a strong stellar wind which blows a stellar
wind bubble and sculpts the parent MCs. The SNR ex-
panding inside the bubble may ﬁnally interact with the
molecular cavity wall if the MC has not been dissipated,
and actually several such SNRs have been revealed dur-
ing the past several decades (see Chen et al. 2014; Zhang
et al. 2015 and references therein). Chen et al. (2013)
found a linear relationship between the size of the mas-
sive star’s molecular cavity and the star’s initial mass

shell delineates the western radio outer shell and conﬁnes
the middle shell. If the smaller hemisphere correspond-
ing to the bright X-ray/IR ﬁlaments is in contact with
the molecular cavity created by the progenitor’s stellar
wind, we can adopt Rb ≥ R1 ∼ 4′ (8.3 pc; we use ≥
here since part of the wind energy may leak into the ten-
uous medium). The progenitor mass of Kes 79 is thus
estimated to be ≥ 14 ± 2 M⊙.

Another method to estimate the progenitor mass is to
compare the metal compositions inferred from the X-ray
spectra with those predicted in the nucleosynthesis mod-
els. This method requires that diﬀerent metal species
are well mixed and observed, if the abundances from the

global gas properties are used for comparison. Accord-
ing to the XMM-Newton spectral analysis of the global
hot gas, Kes 79 has enriched Ne (1.8), Mg (1.6), Si (1.4)
, S (1.7), and Ar (∼ 1.8). We ﬁrst compare the best-
ﬁt abundances of Ne, Mg, S, and Ar relative to Si (e.g,
[Ar/Si]/[Ar/Si]⊙) in Kes 79 to those produced by the
progenitors with diﬀerent masses based on the spheri-
cal core-collapse nucleosynthesis models of Nomoto et
al. (2006) and Woosley & Weaver (1995). Diﬀerences
between the two models are discussed by Kumar et al.
(2014; see also Kumar et al. 2012). However, we ﬁnd that
none of the available nucleosynthesis models can explain
all of the observed metal abundance ratios for this SNR.
We subsequently compare the element masses in the
X-ray-emitting gas with the predicted SN yields in the
two nucleosynthesis models, which can provide at least
a lower limit of the SNR’s progenitor mass. The ele-
ment (Z) mass MZ is estimated from the abundance AZ
and the mass of the hot component Mh (= 42 ± 1M⊙):
MZ = AZMh(MZ⊙/M⊙), where (MZ⊙/M⊙) is the so-
lar mass fraction of the metal Z adopted from Anders
& Grevesse (1989). As shown in Figure 12, a progenitor
mass less than 15 M⊙ can be excluded (spherical explo-
sion models), since the mass of observed Ne exceeds that
predicted in the ≤ 15 M⊙ yield models. It is consistent
with the value ≥ 14 ± 2 M⊙ given by the Rb–M relation
(discussed above). The observed metal masses are no
larger than the 20 M⊙ yield models for either the spher-
ical or bipolar explosion (hypernova model with kinetic
energy 10–30 times of the typical value of 1051 erg) sce-
narios. Under the assumption that most of the ejecta are
observed in the X-ray band and that the Ne and Mg are
well mixed in the SNR, the progenitor mass of Kes 79 is
likely between 15 and 20 M⊙.

However, the element masses are not consistent with
any group of the modeled nucleosynthesis yields. The
ﬁrst explanation is that the ejecta are not well mixed or
asymmetrically distributed in the SNR. Asymmetric dis-
tribution of ejecta is present in the SNR as discussed in
Section 4.3. An alternative reason might be that Kes 79
is born from an asymmetric explosion with normal ki-
netic energy (∼ 1051 erg) and the ejecta abundances
cannot be explained with current spherical explosion or
hypernova bipolar explosion model. Last but not least,
the available nucleosynthesis models do not consistently
provide similar yields, partly because of the assumptions
made in the calculations. Future detailed models incor-
porating mildly asymmetric explosions and binary evo-
lution are desirable to provide a more secure constraint
on the progenitor of Kes 79 and other SNRs.

5. SUMMARY
We have investigated the multi-wavelength emission
from the thermal composite SNR Kes 79. Using the
multi-transition CO data covering the whole SNR, we
study the large-scale molecular environment as well as
the small-scale structures which cause the asymmetries of
the SNR. We also revisit the 380 ks XMM-Newton MOS
data and carry out imaging and spectroscopic analysis of
the X-ray-emitting plasma. The combined long-exposure
X-ray data allow us to study the detailed distribution of
diﬀerent elements and the hot gas properties across the
SNR. The main results are summarized as follows.

1. We provide kinematic and morphological evidence
to support the interaction of SNR Kes 79 with
the MCs in the velocity range 95-115 km s−1: (1)
broadened 12CO J = 3–2 line (∆v ≈ 12 km s−1)
is detected for the ﬁrst time near the protrusion
at the northeastern radio boundary; (2) the mor-
phology agreement between the two 12CO J = 3–2
ﬁlaments and the radio/IR/X-ray ﬁlaments in the
east, and between the western molecular shell and
the radio shells; and (3) the red-shifted 12CO lines
relative to 13CO, suggesting an interaction with the
MCs from the foreground SNR. The molecular gas
region (mostly inside a 22′ region) near Kes 79 has
a mass of ∼ 5.7d2
7.1 × 104 M⊙, which is typical for
a GMC.

2. The overall X-ray-emitting gas can be character-
ized by a cool (kTc = 0.195+0.003
−0.002 keV) under-
ionized plasma with τh = 6.4 ± 0.4 × 1011 cm−3 s
and solar abundances, plus a hot (kTh = 0.80 ±
0.01 keV) plasma with ionization timescale of τh =
8.1 ± 0.1 × 1010 cm−3 s and elevated Ne (1.83+0.04
−0.05),
Mg (1.56 ± 0.03 ), Si (1.40 ± 0.02), S (1.72 ± 0.03),
and Ar (1.8 ± 0.1) abundances. The average den-
sities of the two components are ∼ 2 cm−3 and ∼
0.5 cm−3, respectively. The masses are ∼ 280 M⊙
and ∼ 40 M⊙, respectively. Hence, most of the
X-ray emission is contributed by the shocked ISM.
Kes 79 has a Sedov age of 4.4–6.7 kyr. The mean
shock velocity is 7.3 × 102 km s−1.

3. The XMM-Newton image of Kes 79 reveals many
bright X-ray ﬁlaments embedded in a faint halo. A
two-temperature model (generally kTc ∼ 0.2 keV
and kTh ∼ 0.7–1.0 keV) is required to describe
the small-scale regions’ spectra all over the SNR.
The ﬁlamentary gas has densities ∼ 4–13 cm−3 and
∼ 1–2 cm−3 for the cool and hot components, re-
spectively, which are much larger than those of the
halo gas (∼ 1.4–2.4 cm−3 and ∼ 0.3–0.5 cm−3 for
the cool and hot components, respectively). The
ionization ages of the hot component in the ﬁla-
ments (0.5–2.0 kyr) are smaller than in the halo
(∼ 4–11 kyr). The X-ray-bright ﬁlaments are prob-
ably produced by the SNR interaction with the
dense ambient gas, while the halo forms from SNR
breaking out to a low-density medium.

4. The SNR shock propagating into the dense gas
produces bright ﬁlamentary radiation in multiple
wavelengths. The X-ray ﬁlaments show good spa-
tial correlation with the 24 µm IR ﬁlaments and
part of the radio shells. The ﬁlamentary mid-IR
emission may come from the dust grains collision-
ally heated by the hot plasma.

5. Due to shaping by the inhomogeneous environ-
ment, Kes 79 is likely to have a double-hemisphere
morphology. The smaller hemisphere containing
bright ﬁlaments is at the back side and projected
into the SNR interior. Projection eﬀect can ex-
plain the multiple-shell structures and the thermal
composite morphology of Kes 79.

7. The progenitor mass of Kes 79 is estimated to be
15–20 M⊙ by using two methods: (1) the linear
relation between the progenitor mass and the wind
blown bubble size (Rb–M relation), and (2) a com-
parison between the metal masses and the yields
predicted by nucleosynthesis models.
