ABSTRACT

We compare the coronal magnetic energy and helicity of two solar active regions (ARs), proliﬁc in major eruptive
(AR 11158) and conﬁned (AR 12192) ﬂaring, and analyze the potential of deduced proxies to forecast upcoming ﬂares.
Based on nonlinear force-free (NLFF) coronal magnetic ﬁeld models with a high degree of solenoidality, and applying
three diﬀerent computational methods to investigate the coronal magnetic helicity, we are able to draw conclusions
with a high level of conﬁdence. Based on real observations of two solar ARs we checked trends regarding the potential
eruptivity of the active-region corona, as suggested earlier in works that were based on numerical simulations, or solar
observations. Our results support that the ratio of current-carrying to total helicity, |HJ|/|HV |, shows a strong ability
to indicate the eruptive potential of a solar AR. However, |HJ|/|HV | seems not to be indicative for the magnitude
Interpreted in context with earlier observational studies, our
or type of an upcoming ﬂare (conﬁned or eruptive).
ﬁndings furthermore support that the total relative helicity normalized to the magnetic ﬂux at the NLFF model’s
lower boundary, HV /φ2, represents no indicator for the eruptivity.

1. INTRODUCTION

Finn & Antonsen 1984), in the form

Magnetic helicity is uniquely related to the geometri-
cal complexity of the underlying magnetic system, de-
termined by the twist and writhe of individual magnetic
ﬁeld lines, as well as their mutual entanglement. Mag-
netic helictity is a signed scalar quantity that is (almost)
conserved in (resistive) ideal MHD (Berger 1984; Pariat
et al. 2015). Its time evolution reﬂects the dynamic evo-
lution of the respective magnetic system. For practical
cases, such as the solar corona, a gauge-invariant form
of the magnetic helicity has been introduced to allow a
physically meaningful estimation (Berger & Field 1984;

HV =

(cid:90)

V

where the reference ﬁeld B0 shares the normal compo-
nent of the studied ﬁeld B on the volume’s boundary,
∂V. Usually a potential (current-free) ﬁeld is used as
reference ﬁeld. Here, A and A0 are the vector poten-
tials of B and B0, respectively, where B = ∇ × A and
B0 = ∇ × A0.

Since HV in Eq. (1) is computed with respect to a ref-
erence ﬁeld it is called “relative helicity”. Valori et al.
(2012) demonstrated the validity and physical meaning-
fulness to compute (and track in time) the relative mag-
netic helicity in ﬁnite volumes in order to characterize
(the evolution of) a magnetic system.

Following Berger (1999), Eq. (1) may be written as

HV = HJ + HPJ, with

(cid:90)

HJ =

(A − A0) · (B − B0) dV,

V
(cid:90)

HPJ = 2

V

A0 · (B − B0) dV,

(3)

where, HJ is the magnetic helicity of the current-
carrying part of the magnetic ﬁeld, and HPJ is the
volume threading helicity between B0 and the current-
carrying ﬁeld. Because B and B0 are designed such that
they share the same normal distribution on ∂V, not only
HV , but also both HJ and HPJ are independently gauge
invariant.

In contrast to HV , however, HJ and HPJ are not con-
served in ideal MHD, as shown recently by Linan et al.
(2018), who provided the ﬁrst analytical derivation of
the time variation of these helicities. From their an-
alytical study and their analysis of diﬀerent numerical
experiments, they revealed the existence and key role of
a gauge-invariant transfer term between HJ and HPJ,
that enables the exchange between the diﬀerent contri-
butions to HV .

The properties of HJ and HPJ have been investigated
in a few works only so far. Moraitis et al. (2014) studied
them, based on three-dimensional MHD models of the
emergence of a twisted magnetic ﬂux tube, that resulted
in the formation of a small active region (AR) in the
model corona. Two experiments have been analyzed, a
“non-eruptive” and an “eruptive” one. In the eruptive
case, part of the model magnetic structure is ejected
from the simulation volume at least once during the
simulation time span, while in the non-eruptive case the
magnetic ﬁeld remains conﬁned within the model vol-
ume. It was found that at least HJ showed pronounced
ﬂuctuations around the onset of the model mass ejection
in the eruptive simulations.

Pariat et al. (2017) presented a study based on seven
diﬀerent three-dimensional visco-resistive MHD simula-
tions of the emergence of a twisted model ﬂux rope into
a stratiﬁed model atmosphere, that resulted in either a
stable (non-eruptive) or an unstable (eruptive) coronal
conﬁguration. While the basic setup in all of these sim-
ulations was identical, only the strength and direction of
the background (surrounding) magnetic ﬁeld was mod-
iﬁed to obtain the diﬀerent solutions. They concluded
that, for the analyzed set of numerical experiments HV
clearly discriminated between stable and unstable sim-
ulations, in contrast to, e.g., total, potential, and free
magnetic energy, as well as magnetic ﬂux. A generally
higher HV in the stable simulations, however, disquali-
ﬁed HV as a useful quantity to predict eruptive behavior,

at least in cases where the self and mutual helicities are
of opposite sign (see also, e.g., Phillips et al. 2005).

In contrast, signiﬁcantly greater values of HJ during
the pre-eruptive phase, and especially during the time of
strong ﬂux emergence, were noticed from the unstable
simulations studied in Pariat et al. (2017). Even more
powerful, the ratio of the current-carrying to total helic-
ity, |HJ|/|HV |, turned out as to represent a most fruit-
ful proxy for eruptivity, with values (cid:38) 0.45 prior to the
model eruptions, in contrast to the corresponding value
for the stable (non-eruptive) conﬁguration. As noted by
the authors, the threshold |HJ|/|HV | (cid:39) 0.45 is not to be
regarded as a universal one, but rather depends on the
properties of the particular analyzed case.

In another recent study, Zuccarello et al. (2018) in-
vestigated the helicity-based eruptivity threshold using
three-dimensional line-tied MHD simulations, in which
eruptivity was imposed by controlled motions, driven
on the lower boundary of the simulation domain. These
motions were designed such as to mimic the long-term
evolution of solar ARs, including shearing motions and
magnetic diﬀusion on large scales. Starting from the
same initial ﬁeld conﬁguration that contained a ﬂux
rope, the diﬀerent numerical simulations were based
on diﬀerent types of boundary motions that led to
the eruptive evolution. The authors noted a value of
|HJ|/|HV | (cid:39) 0.3 at the onset times of torus instability,
for all simulations, i.e., independently of how the system
was destabilized.

As a side result, analyzing a simulation of the genera-
tion of a solar coronal jet, Linan et al. (2018) also found
that the jet was triggered for large values of the ratio
|HJ|/|HV |, though the focus of the study was primarily
on the analysis of the properties of HJ and HPJ.

So far, only few works attempted to investigate the
decomposed helicity for observational cases. In James
et al. (2018), a nonlinear force-free (NLFF) model of
AR 11504 one hour prior to a ﬁlament eruption was used
to calculate the contributions to the total helicity. They
found |HJ|/|HV | = 0.17, underlying that the thresholds
for eruptivity given in Pariat et al. (2017) and Zuccarello
et al. (2018) are valid with regards to the particular
analyzed simulations only.

Moraitis et al. (2014) was the ﬁrst to attempt the
monitoring of the long-term evolution of the individ-
ual contributors to magnetic helicity for two solar ARs
(11072 and 11158, proliﬁc in conﬁned and eruptive ﬂar-
ing, respectively). The time evolution of HJ showed a
clear correspondence to rapid ﬂux emergence and the
formation of a ﬁlament and a X2.2 ﬂare in AR 11158,
despite the rather low time cadence of the underlying
NLFF models (four hours). The corresponding analysis

of AR 11072 was hampered by a non-satisfactory level
of solenoidality of the underlying NLFF solutions.

Just recently, two studies dealt with the long-term
evolution of the magnetic energy and helicity budgets
in solar ARs that hosted major ﬂares, based on helic-
ity computations of unprecedented accuracy, within the
application to observed data. Moraitis et al. (2019) an-
alyzed the helicity and energy budgets of AR 12673, in
the course of two major ﬂares (a preceding conﬁned and
a following eruptive X-ﬂare). They found distinct local
maxima in time evolution of |HJ|/|HV | allowing them to
suggest an approximate threshold of |HJ|/|HV | (cid:39) 0.15
for the eruptivity in that AR. Their results are in line
with that of Thalmann et al. (2019) who analyzed the
coronal evolution of AR 11158. Though the primary fo-
cus of the latter study was on the sensitivity of the mag-
netic helicity computation with respect to the solenoidal
property of the underlying NLFF solution (for more de-
tails see also Sect. 2.3.1 in the present study), an approx-
imate characteristic pre-ﬂare level of |HJ|/|HV | (cid:39) 0.2
can be identiﬁed in their Fig. 4(d).

In our work, we go further and provide the ﬁrst study
of the (decomposed) magnetic helicity budget in two so-
lar ARs of diﬀerent respective ﬂare proﬁle (proliﬁc in
either major conﬁned or major eruptive ﬂares) and evo-
fast evolving with
lutionary stage (well-developed vs.
rapid ﬂux emergence). For this purpose, we study
AR 11158 during February 2011 and AR 12192 dur-
ing October 2014, respectively. We analyze the coronal
magnetic helicities and energies in the course of con-
ﬁned and eruptive ﬂaring, to study their potential to
discriminate the two types of ﬂaring timely before their
occurrence. Importantly, we base our analysis on opti-
mized NLFF time series, with highly satisfactory force-
free and solenoidal properties, to allow helicity compu-
tations of unprecedented accuracy. Moreover, we incor-
porate the results of three diﬀerent helicity computation
methods, in order to explore the possible spread of val-
ues obtained.

2. METHODS

2.1. AR selection

We aim to compare the coronal magnetic energy and
helicity of two solar ARs, proliﬁc in major (GOES class
M5.0 and larger) eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares. AR
AR 11158, produced the ﬁrst X-class ﬂares of solar cycle
24. All major ﬂares of this AR, as observed during disk
passage in February 2011, were associated with CMEs.
In contrast, AR AR 12192 showed a ﬂare proﬁle that
clearly deviates from known ﬂare-CME statistics (e.g.,
Yashiro et al. 2006) in that, during its disk passage in

3

October 2014, it produced six conﬁned X-class ﬂares,
but none was associated with a CME.

2.2. Data

The magnetic characteristics were studied based on
photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data (Hoeksema et al.
2014), derived from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO;
Pesnell et al. 2012) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Schou et al. 2012) polarization measurements.
In particular, the hmi.sharp cea 720s data series was
used which contains a Lambert Cylindrical Equal-Area
projected magnetic ﬁeld vector, decomposed into Br ,
Bφ, and Bθ at each remapped grid point, within auto-
matically identiﬁed active-region patches (Bobra et al.
2014). These spherical components relate to the helio-
graphic magnetic ﬁeld components, as deﬁned in Gary &
Hagyard (1990), as (Bx , By , Bz ) = (Bφ, −Bθ, Br ), where
x, y and z denote the solar positive-westward, posi-
tive northward and vertical direction, respectively. The
native resolution of the photospheric ﬁeld data is 0.03
CEA-degree, corresponding to ≈ 360 km pixel−1 at disk
center.

Within large sunspot umbrae, unreasonable magnetic
ﬁeld values with high errors are sometimes present in
HMI data products. The center of the negative-polarity
sunspot in AR 12192 represents such a case, with a patch
of abnormally weak Bz (i.e., Br). In order to compen-
sate for the artiﬁcial magnetic proﬁle within the sunspot
umbra, we use the irregularly sampled but known and
accurately measured magnetic ﬁeld values, to interpo-
late smoothly over the grid of erroneous measurements,
using bilinear interpolation.

2.3. Modeling

2.3.1. Magnetic ﬁeld modeling

For NLFF modeling, we binned the photospheric data
by a factor of four, to a resolution of ≈ 2(cid:48)(cid:48) pixel−1,
while almost preserving the magnetic ﬂux. The adopted
computational domains are of the extent of 148 × 92 ×
128 pixel3 and 276 × 200 × 128 pixel3, to model the
force-free corona of AR 11158 and 12192, respectively.
The NLFF equilibria are computed using the method
of Wiegelmann & Inhester (2010). In this way, we ob-
tain the quasi-static evolution of the solar corona in and
around AR 11158 from 2011 February 11 19:00 UT to
February 15 23:59 UT, and for AR 12192 from 2014 Oc-
tober 20 06:59 UT to October 25 11:59 UT. Around the
time of intense ﬂares (equal or larger GOES class M5.0),
we use the native time cadence of 12 minutes and use
an 1-hour cadence otherwise.

Two controlling parameter are frequently used to
quantify the consistency of the obtained NLFF solu-

4

tions. The current-weighted angle between the modeled
magnetic ﬁeld and electric current density, θJ , (Schri-
jver et al. 2006) and the volume-averaged fractional ﬂux,
(cid:104)|fi|(cid:105), (Wheatland et al. 2000), which is a measure of lo-
cal deviations from solenoidality within the model vol-
ume. As a rule of thumb, the smaller the corresponding
values are, the more force- and divergence-free a NLFF
solution is. For a perfectly force-free and solenoidal
NLFF solution, θJ = 0 and (cid:104)|fi|(cid:105) = 0.

For the NLFF time series of AR 11158, we ﬁnd median
values of θJ = 15.6◦ ± 2.7◦ and (cid:104)|fi|(cid:105) × 104 = 2.23 ± 0.98.
The corresponding estimates for AR 12192 are θJ =
5.62◦±0.16◦ and (cid:104)|fi|(cid:105)×104 = 3.46±0.25, underlying the
high quality of the NLFF ﬁelds for subsequent reliable
helicity computation (see Thalmann et al. 2019, for a
dedicated study).

Also Valori et al. (2016) highlighted that, in order
to guarantee a reliable computation of magnetic helic-
ity, the input magnetic ﬁeld has to fulﬁll certain re-
quirements concerning its divergence-freeness, i.e., how
well ∇ · B is satisﬁed.
It was shown that if the ratio
Ediv/E (cid:38) 0.1, the error in the computation of HV may
grow considerably (see their Sect. 7 and Fig. 8(b)). The
expression Ediv is based on the decomposition of the
magnetic energy within V by Valori et al. (2013), in the
form

E =

1
2µ0

(cid:90)

V

B2 dV = E0 + EJ

= E0,s + EJ,s + E0,ns + EJ,ns + Emix,

(4)

with E0 and EJ being the energies of the potential and
current-carrying magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. E0 is used
to compute an upper limit for the free energy as EF =
E − E0. E0,s and EJ,s are the energies of the poten-
tial and current-carrying solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponents. E0,ns and EJ,ns are those of the correspond-
ing non-solenoidal components. All terms are positive-
deﬁned, except for Emix, which corresponds to all cross
terms (see Eq. (8) in Valori et al. 2013, for the detailed
expressions). For a perfectly solenoidal ﬁeld, one ﬁnds
E0,s = E0, EJ,s = EJ, and E0,ns = EJ,ns = Emix = 0.
Based on Eq. (4), the divergence-based energy contribu-
tion is deﬁned as Ediv = E0,ns + EJ,ns + |Emix|.

Recently, an extension to the work of Valori et al.
(2016) who investigated the corresponding eﬀect based
on an idealized model, was presented by Thalmann et al.
(2019) who considered the dependency of helicity com-
putations on the ﬁeld’s solenoidal property in NLFF
time series based on solar observations. It was shown
that helicity computations may be meaningful and trust-
worthy only, if Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.05 and (cid:104)|fi|(cid:105) × 104 (cid:46) 5, for

present work, both NLFF time series have a median
value of Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.01, and thus, we may safely as-
sume a correspondingly small error in the helicity com-
putations. Note that these values, together with that of
(cid:104)|fi|(cid:105) listed above, are considerably better than in ear-
lier works (e.g., Moraitis et al. 2014; James et al. 2018;
Moraitis et al. 2019).

2.3.2. Magnetic helicity computation

The 3D cubes containing the NLFF magnetic ﬁeld are
used as an input to three diﬀerent ﬁnite-volume (FV)
helicity computation methods. In brief, the method of
Thalmann et al. (2011) to compute the relative helic-
ity, solves systems of partial diﬀerential equations to
obtain the vector potentials A and A0, employing the
Coulomb gauge, ∇ · A = ∇ · A0 = 0, (“FVCoul JT”
hereafter; see also Sect. 2.1 of Valori et al. 2016, for de-
tails). The methods of Valori et al. (2012) and Moraitis
et al. (2014) are based on an integral formulation for
the vector potentials within a ﬁnite volume and employ
a DeVore gauge, Az = Ap,z = 0, (see also Sect. 2.2
of Valori et al. 2016). The two methods diﬀer in the
way in which the Laplace equation for the potential
ﬁeld solution is solved numerically, as well as the nu-
merical calculation of the involved integrals and deriva-
tives. The method of Valori et al. (2012) is referred to
as “FVDeV GV”, hereafter. We consider two realizations
of the FVDeV KM method, one where the rectangle in-
tegration rule is used (“FVDeV KM”) , and one where
the weighted trapezoidal rule is used (“FVw
DeV KM”) to
compute the involved integrals. All methods deﬁne the
reference ﬁeld as B0 = ∇ϕ, with ϕ being the scalar
potential, subject to the constraint ∇nϕ = Bn on ∂V,
and solve the corresponding Laplace equation for ϕ with
diﬀerent methods.

The methods have been tested in the framework of an
extended proof-of-concept study on ﬁnite-volume helic-
ity computation methods (Valori et al. 2016), where it
has been shown that for various test setups the methods
deliver helicity values in line with each other, diﬀering
by a few percent only, given a suﬃciently low level of
∇ · B in the underlying magnetic test case.

2.4. Analyzed quantities

We apply the diﬀerent FV helicity computation meth-
ods to the two time series of NLFF extrapolations for
AR 11158 and AR 12192, and correspondingly obtain
four, possibly diﬀering, results for each time instant for
the extensive quantities HV and its contributors, HPJ
and HJ, as well as for E0, and thus EF, since the dif-
ferent FV helicity computation methods derive B0 in
a diﬀerent numerical way. For each time instance, we
compute the mean values ¯E0, ¯EF, ¯HV , ¯HJ, and ¯HPJ,

and consider this as to be the most representative ap-
proximation of the real values.

In order to make the computed quantities of the two
diﬀerent ARs better comparable, we also calculate in-
tensive quantities. We deﬁne the normalized helicity
(cid:82)
as ¯HV /φ2, where φ = 1
i.e., half of
2
the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, φ, across the NLFF
lower boundary. Often employed proxies to quantify the
non-potentiality and eruptivity of the considered mag-
netic conﬁguration are the form of the free energy ratio,
¯EF/E, where E is the total magnetic energy of the input
NLFF ﬁelds, and the helicity ratio, | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV |.

S(z=0) |Bz|dS,

All mean values are presented and interpreted in con-
text with the spread of the four values obtained for
the individual physical quantities, where we deﬁne the
spread as to be bounded by the two estimates which
deviate the most from the respective mean value.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Coronal magnetic ﬁeld structure

In agreement with previous works, we ﬁnd the coro-
nal magnetic ﬁeld above AR 11158 on February 14 at
∼21:00 UT in the form of a low-lying magnetic ﬂux rope
aligned with the main polarity inversion line and sur-
rounded by the large-scale ﬁeld associated to the strong
westernmost positive and easternmost negative polarity
patches of the AR (Fig. 1(a)). Similar model results
have been presented and discussed in, e.g., Jing et al.
(2012); Sun et al. (2012); Inoue et al. (2013).

The coronal magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration above
AR 12192 on October 24 at ∼19:00 UT appears in
the form of a low-lying weakly twisted ﬂux rope above
the main polarity inversion line of the AR (Fig. 1(b)),
bridged by the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld associated to
the dispersed magnetic ﬁeld surrounding. Similar model
results have been presented in, e.g., Jing et al. (2015);
Sun et al. (2015); Inoue et al. (2016).

3.2. Extensive quantities:
Magnetic ﬂux, free magnetic energy, and helicities

3.2.1. AR 11158

Upon emergence, AR 11158 exhibited a considerable
increase in the total unsigned ﬂux (Fig. 2(a); black line),
starting from late February 12, which corresponds to the
time when a pronounced ﬁlament was emerging, as ana-
lyzed in detail by, e.g., Sun et al. (2012). Parts of the ﬁl-
ament erupted during two eruptive ﬂares, an M6.6 ﬂare
(SOL2011-02-13T17:38) and an X2.2 ﬂare (SOL2011-02-
15T01:56).

The corresponding evolution of the mean free mag-
netic energy, ¯EF, is shown in Fig. 2(c). The spread of the
energy values deduced from the diﬀerent FV methods is

shown as gray shaded area, and is bounded by the results
from the FVDeV KM/FVCoul JT method at higher/lower
energies. Two distinct episodes can be distinguished.
First, a considerable increase of ¯EF, co-temporal with
the strong ﬂux emergence, resulting in a free magnetic
energy of ≈ 0.8×1032 erg early on February 13. Second,
notable decreases of ¯EF are observed around the two ma-
jor eruptive ﬂares (the M6.6 and X2.2 ﬂare, marked by a
vertical dashed and solid line, respectively). The trends
just discussed compare well with results previously pub-
lished in literature (e.g., Sun et al. 2012; Jing et al. 2015;
Tziotziou et al. 2013).

The time evolution of the mean magnetic helicity, ¯HV
(Fig. 2(e)), also reﬂects the emergence of the magnetic
ﬂux rope, with ¯HV increasing from ≈ 0.1 × 1042 Mx2 to
≈ 3 × 1042 Mx2. The response to the occurring eruptive
ﬂares is reﬂected by a response similar to that of ¯EF,

The individual contributions of the current-carrying
( ¯HJ) and volume-threading ( ¯HPJ) helicities are shown
in Fig. 2(g) (dotted and solid curve, respectively).
Throughout the considered time period, both, ¯HJ and
¯HPJ are positive, with ¯HPJ being the dominated con-
tributor to ¯HV at most time instances (being a factor
of 2–10 larger than ¯HJ).

3.2.2. AR 12192

AR 12192, the largest solar AR observed during the
past ∼24 years, exhibited a more or less constant and
unusually high unsigned magnetic ﬂux (≈ 2 × 1023 Mx)
during disk passage (see also, e.g., Table 1 of Sun et al.
2015). The little variation resulted from the slow time
evolution of the well-developed AR, in absence of strong
ﬂux emergence (Fig. 2(b)).

The corresponding evolution of ¯EF (Fig. 2(d)) is
characterized by distinct variations around three ma-
jor conﬁned ﬂares (SOL2014-10-22T01:59M8.7, 2014-
10-22T14:28X1.6, and 2014-10-24T21:41X3.1), with
the spread of solutions being bound by that of the
FVDeV KM and FVCoul JT method at higher and lower
energies, respectively. Despite the similar trend, we ﬁnd
¯EF by a factor of 10 higher than Jing et al. (2015), and
in the approximate range 2–3 × 1033
erg. Given the
unusually high unsigned magnetic ﬂux, we regard our
numbers as highly plausible, however. This is further
substantiated by an estimated mean free magnetic en-
ergy of ≈15%, which for an AR with a well deﬁned ﬂux
rope is highly realistic (see Sect. 3.3.2 and Fig. 3(b)).

¯HV was negative increasing from about −4×1044 Mx2
to −6 × 1044 Mx2 during the considered time period
(see Fig. 2(f) and note the reversed y-axis labeling).
The time evolution of ¯HV shows hardly any sensitiv-
ity towards the occurrence of the major conﬁned ﬂares.
The spread of the solutions of the individual methods
is bounded by the values derived from the FVCoul JT
(FVDeV GV) method at higher (lower) values. Similar
as for ¯EF before, also our estimates of ¯HV are by a fac-
tor of 10 larger than those presented in Jing et al. (2015),
still showing a similar trend. Yet again, our results are
compatible with the strong magnetic ﬂux in AR 12192,
substantially higher than that of “typical” ARs (a few
1022 Mx; see, e.g., Fig. 4 of Toriumi et al. 2017). Also,
our results are highly reliable, given the low value of
Ediv/E in the underlying NLFF models (see Sect. 2.3.1).
¯HV is dominated by the contribution of ¯HPJ at all
times (Fig. 2(h); solid line), with ¯HJ being by a factor
of ∼25 smaller (Fig. 2(h); dotted line). The spread of

7

solutions for HPJ is bounded by that of FVCoul JT and
FVDeV GV at high and low helicities. That of HJ is
bound by FVDeV KM and FVDeV GV, respectively.

3.3. Intensive quantities:
Normalized helicity and eruptivity proxies

The goal of our study is to compare ARs that hosted
almost exclusively major conﬁned (AR 12192) or erup-
tive ﬂares (AR 11158), during their disk passage. The
analysis of the extensive quantities ¯EF, ¯HV , ¯HJ, and
¯HPJ, above (see Sect. 3.2), revealed quite some diﬀer-
ences between the two ARs. Well-developed and slowly
evolving AR 12192 hosted a total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux, φ, and free magnetic energy, ¯EF, and a helicity
of the current-carrying ﬁeld, ¯HJ, about 10 times larger
than the newly formed and rapidly evolving AR 11158.
Only, the decomposition of ¯HV into ¯HJ and ¯HPJ, re-
vealed that ¯HV in AR 12192 exceeded that of AR 11158
by a factor of 100, due to the contribution of the volume-
threading helicity, ¯HPJ. In order to more easily compare
the two diﬀerent ARs, we analyze intensive quantities in
the following.

3.3.1. AR 11158

The energy ratio shows increasing trends prior to the
eruptive ﬂares and values ¯EF/E (cid:38) 0.17 (Fig. 3(a); see
horizontal dashed line for reference). Highest values are
obtained for the time period related to the strong ﬂux
emergence, with ¯EF/E (cid:39) 0.25. Prior to the presence of
strong magnetic ﬂuxes (before late February 12), it is
considerably smaller ( ¯EF/E (cid:46) 0.1). The spread of val-
ues of ¯EF/E is bounded by the solutions of FVDeV KM
and FVCoul JT at its higher and lower bound, respec-
tively.

Peak values of ¯HV /φ2 (cid:38) 0.05 are also found around
the time of strong ﬂux emergence (early on February 13),
while it is (cid:46) 0.04 at most other times (Fig. 3c). The
spread of solutions is bound by the results obtained with
the FVDeV KM and FVCoul JT at higher and lower val-
ues, respectively.

| ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | shows an (in-) decreasing trend (before)
after the major eruptive ﬂares, with pre-ﬂare values
| ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | (cid:38) 0.17 (Fig. 3(e); see horizontal dashed line
for reference). Note also the little spread of the results
based on the diﬀerent methods. The spread of solutions
is bound by the results obtained with the FVDeV KM
and FVCoul JT at higher and lower values, respectively.

3.3.2. AR 12192

The energy ratio shows no clear trends prior to the
occurrence of the major conﬁned ﬂares, and values
¯EF/E (cid:46) 0.17 at all times (Fig. 3(b); see horizontal

Very little variation of | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | is found around the
time of the major conﬁned ﬂares, including no signiﬁcant
increase, or a characteristic pre-ﬂare value (Fig. 3(f)).
The spread is bounded by the solutions of FVCoul JT
(FVDeV GV) at low (high) values.

4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We aimed to compare the coronal magnetic energy
and helicity of two solar ARs, proliﬁc in major erup-
tive (AR 11158) and conﬁned (AR 12192) ﬂares, and

analyze the potential of proxies for eruptivity ( ¯EF/E,
| ¯HJ|/| ¯HV |) to hint at the upcoming ﬂares. AR 11158
was rapidly evolving and produced the ﬁrst major ﬂares
of solar cycle 24, all associated with CMEs.
In con-
trast, well-developed and slowly evolving AR 12192 pro-
duced six major conﬁned X-class ﬂares (i.e., no associ-
ated CMEs).

Our results are based on the application of three dif-
ferent numerical approaches to compute the relative he-
licity (Thalmann et al. 2011; Valori et al. 2012; Moraitis
et al. 2014). Compared to previous works, we based
our energy and helicity computations on time series
of NLFF model solutions with unprecedented quality
regarding their fulﬁllment of the solenoidal condition
((cid:104)|fi|(cid:105) × 104 (cid:46) 4 and Ediv/E (cid:46) 0.01), supporting the
high reliability of our main ﬁndings:

(i) For both ARs, ¯HV and ¯EF exhibit a similar time
evolution (Fig. 2(c)–2(f)). Timely centered around
the emergence of strong magnetic ﬂux, as well as
the occurrence of major ﬂares, we detect signiﬁcant
changes only for CME-productive AR 11158.

(ii) For the analyzed ARs, ¯HV was dominated by the
contribution of ¯HPJ (Fig. 2(g), 2(h)). Noteworthy,
while the absolute value of HPJ exceeds that of HJ
by a factor of 2–10 in AR 11158, it is about ∼ 25
times larger in AR 12192, probably due to the un-
usually large unsigned magnetic ﬂux (φ ∝ 1023 Mx).

(iii) On average, ¯HV /φ2 is larger for AR 12192 ((cid:38) 0.05;
Fig. 3(d)), compared to that of AR 11158 ((cid:46) 0.04;
Fig. 3(c)). The noteworthy exception is the period
of strong ﬂux emergence early on February 13, with
peak values ¯HV /φ2 (cid:38) 0.13 for AR 11158.

(iv) While the eruptivity proxy,

| ¯HJ|/| ¯HV |,

increases
strongly before major eruptive ﬂares in AR 11158,
only little variation is found for AR 12192 (Fig. 3(e)
and 3(f), respectively). A corresponding statement
holds for ¯EF/E (Fig. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively).
For both, ¯EF/E and | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV |, characteristic pre-
ﬂare values in AR 11158 are (cid:38) 0.17.

(v) | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | does not scale with the size of the ﬂares
in NOAA 11158. We ﬁnd values of | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | (cid:38)
0.4 ((cid:38) 0.17) prior to the eruptive M6.6 (X2.2) ﬂare,
respectively (see Fig. 3(e)).

(vi) A pronounced response of | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | on the occur-
rence of ﬂares is only seen for the major eruptive
ﬂares (i.e., for AR 11158; see Fig. 3(e)).

In summary, our ﬁndings substantiate the suggestion
of Pariat et al. (2017) that the helicity ratio |HJ|/|HV |

shows a strong ability to indicate the eruptive potential
of a magnetic system, and that peak values are to be ex-
pected prior to eruptive ﬂaring. Our results also support
the ﬁndings of Zuccarello et al. (2018) and Linan et al.
(2018) in that a close correlation may exist between large
values of the helicity ratio and eruptivity. In our work,
these ﬁndings are based on real solar observations of two
diﬀerent ARs, whereas the aforementioned studies were
based on numerical simulations.

The analysis of Pariat et al. (2017) was based on nu-
merical simulations of a solar-like AR, that involved
distinct reorganizations of the model coronal magnetic
ﬁeld. More precisely, a ﬂux rope rises from the convec-
tion zone to reconnect with the magnetic ﬁeld in the
low atmosphere above, to form a secondary twisted ﬂux
rope. This secondary ﬂux rope is either stable (in the
non-eruptive simulations; Leake et al. 2013) or unsta-
ble (in the eruptive simulations; Leake et al. 2014). We
may therefore compare our helicity analysis of AR 12192
and 11158 with the corresponding analysis of the stable
and unstable simulations, respectively, by Pariat et al.
(2017).

Pariat et al. (2017) suggested that |HJ|/|HV |
is
(smaller) larger in (non-) eruptive cases, based on nu-
merical simulations, composed of a model ﬂux rope
emerging into an overlying arcade ﬁeld (non-) favorable
for magnetic reconnection. For a given dipole strength of
the overlying ﬁeld arcade, they found |HV | to be (larger)
smaller for the (non-) eruptive case (compare, e.g., vio-
let dash-dotted and red dashed lines in their Fig. 5(a)),
if the orientation of the upper part of the poloidal ﬁeld
of the ﬂux rope was oriented parallel (anti-parallel) with
respect to the overlying arcade ﬁeld.

Similarly, In our work, we ﬁnd (smaller) larger values
of | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | for (non-) eruptive AR (12192) 11158. We
assume that the smaller | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | in AR 12192 can be
attributed to the substantially higher unsigned magnetic
ﬂux, φ, and thus a much larger | ¯HV |.

Noteworthy, | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | in our study appears indicative
only for the upcoming major eruptive ﬂares in AR 11158,
but not for the major conﬁned ﬂares in AR 12192. This
indicates that |HJ|/|HV | is a good proxy for the erup-
tive potential of an AR, but cannot be expected to serve
as an indicator whether an upcoming ﬂare will involve
the rearrangement of the magnetic ﬁeld in a conﬁned
(non-eruptive) or eruptive manner. This speculation is
supported by the recent work of Moraitis et al. (2019)
who studied the magnetic helicity of AR 12673, around
two consecutive major X-class ﬂares (a preceding con-
ﬁned and a following eruptive one, about three hours
later). They found values of |HJ|/|HV | comparable with

10

Thalmann et al.

that of AR 11158 in our study, with even higher values
prior to the major conﬁned ﬂare.

Our observation based analysis represents an exten-
sion of the work by James et al. (2018) and Moraitis
et al. (2019), who suggested values of |HJ|/|HV | (cid:38) 0.15
to be characteristic for the immediate pre-ﬂare mag-
netic ﬁeld, based on NLFF modeling of the solar corona
above selected ARs. Based on our long-term analysis of
AR 11158, we ﬁnd values of | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV | (cid:38) 0.17 prior to
In addition, we notice that
the major eruptive ﬂares.
the pre-ﬂare magnitude of |HJ|/|HV | appears unrelated
to the intensity of the eruptive ﬂares.

In the statistical survey of the magnetic helicity injec-
tion in (345) 48 (non-) X-class ﬂare productive ARs by
LaBonte et al. (2007), HV was approximated by the ac-
cumulated photospheric helicity ﬂux during speciﬁed ob-
serving intervals. From their Fig. 8, a signiﬁcant spread
of HV is noticeable for a given AR magnetic ﬂux, and
that the corresponding AR may not necessarily produce
an X-ﬂare. Since literally all X-class ﬂares are eruptive
(e.g., Yashiro et al. 2006), this ﬁnding is equivalent to
the argument that the normalized helicity, HV /φ2, is not
indicative for eruptivity. In our work, we ﬁnd values for
¯HV /φ2 for non-eruptive AR 12192 in the same range as
those of eruptive AR 12673 (Moraitis et al. 2019). Thus,
in line with the statistical work of LaBonte et al. (2007),
we suggest that ¯HV /φ2 does not serve as discriminant
factor for the eruptive potential of a solar AR.

For completeness, we note distinct local maxima in
the time proﬁle of ¯EF/E prior to eruptive ﬂare occur-
rences in AR 11158, though small compared to the cor-
responding variations for AR 12192, and with much less
pronounced diﬀerences than for the respective time pro-
ﬁles of | ¯HJ|/| ¯HV |. Therefore, we agree with earlier works
(e.g., Pariat et al. 2017; Moraitis et al. 2019) that though
EF (and thus EF/E) is tightly linked to the potential
eruptivity of an AR, it does not represent a suﬃcient
condition for an eruption to occur.

Last, we note that all of the analyzed extensive quan-
tities (and possibly also the intensive ones) may depend,
in general, on the extension of the analyzed volume
and the spatial resolution of the vector magnetogram
data. In the present work, for convenience, we binned
the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data by a fac-
tor of four, prior to magnetic ﬁeld modeling and sub-
sequent magnetic helicity computation. A ﬁrst attempt
to quantify corresponding diﬀerences has been presented
by DeRosa et al. (2015), who applied diﬀerent existing
NLFF modeling techniques to a sequence of vector mag-
netograms with diﬀerent spatial resolutions, constructed
from polarimetric inversion of polarization spectra that
were binned by factors ranging from 2 to 16. Their re-
sults suggested that, even given a suﬃcient fulﬁllment of
the solenoidal property, the magnetic helicity computed
from the model magnetic ﬁelds of diﬀerent spatial res-
olution (using the method of Valori et al. 2012), for a
given NLFF method, may vary substantially.

We expect further substantiation and clariﬁcation of
the aspects discussed above from anticipated future
studies, based on the analysis of the helicity budgets of
a large number of solar ARs, that will correspondingly
allow more robust statements.
