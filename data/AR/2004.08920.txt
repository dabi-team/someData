1.  Introduction 

BtScCoV-512, 

Coronaviruses include a large and diverse family of 
enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses [1]. The latest 
International  Committee  of  Taxonomy  of  Viruses 
(ICTV)  classification  indicate  that  the  thirty-eight 
species of coronaviruses belong to one of four genera (α-
,  β-,  δ-,  and  γ-)  [2],  where  α-  and  β-CoVs  principally 
infect mammals, seventeen species among them hosted 
in bats (BtCoV-HKU10, BtCoV-CDPHE15, BtRfCoV-
HuB13,  BtMiCoV-1,  BtMiCoV-HKU8,  BtMy-Sax11, 
BtNy-Sc13, 
BtRhCoV-HKU2, 
BtKYNL63,  BtHpCoV-ZJ13,  MERSr-CoV,  BtPiCoV-
BtEoCoV-GCCDC1, 
HKU5, 
BtRoCoV-HKU9  and  SARSr-CoV),  γ-  and  δ-CoVs 
principally  infect  birds.  Six  species  of  CoVs:  α-CoVs 
229E  and  NL63  and  β-CoVs  HCoV-HKU1,  MERSr-
CoV, SARSr-CoV and HCoV-OC43 can infect human 
causing  diseases.  [3-6].  SARS-CoV  and  MERS-CoV 
were the causal agents of respiratory disease outbreaks 
in  2002  and  2012  in  Guangdong  Province,  China,  and 
the  Middle  East,  respectively  [4,5,7,8].  A  novel 
coronavirus  was  isolated  and  identified  in  2019  in 
Wuhan,  China,  which  was  named  2019  novel 
coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [8,9].

On  17th  February  and  according  to  world  health 
organization,  a  number  of  71  429  confirmed  cases  
worldwide, among them 2162 new cases recorded in last 
24 hours. 2019-nCoV caused 1772 deaths in china and 3 
death  outside  [10].  The  coronavirus  3CL  hydrolase 
(Mpro)  enzyme,  also  known  as  the  main  protease, 
exhibits an important function in the viral life-cycle. Its 
inhibition provides a promising therapeutic principle for 
developing  treatments  against  CoViD-19  to  prevent 
further spread [11-13]. 

The 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) is one of coronaviruses’ 
proteases. CoVMpro has become an attractive target for 
anti-CoV  drug  design, due  to  his  responsibility  for  the 
maturation  of  itself  and  key  functional  enzymes  such 
as:replicase and helicase. It is involved in counteracting 
the  host  innate  immune  response  [14-16].  It  has  been 
reported  that  The  Mpros  of  two  CoVs  infecting  pigs 
antagonize  the  host  immune  response.  They  cleave 
porcine 
site, 
Gln231↓Val232, where NEMO is required for activating 
the NF-κB and IRF3 pathways, which abrogates NF-κB 
signaling and inhibits IFNβ induction [17,18]. the Mpro 
of  PDCoV  also  impair  the  JAK-STAT  pathway  by 
processing porcine STAT2 at two sites, Gln685↓Glu686 
and Gln758↓Ser759 [14,19].

the 

Hispidin 

(6-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)-4-hydroxy-2-
pyrone)  is  a  polyphenol  and  an  important  medicinal 
metabolite  [20].  It  is  widespread  among  fungi  of  the 
Strophariaceae  family,  genera  Gymnopilus  P.karst, 

 
 
Hypholoma (Fr.) P.Kumm. and Pholiota (Fr.) P.Kumm. 
[21].  Hispidin  was  originally  isolated  as  the  main 
compound  of  Inonotus  hipidus  (Bull.)  P.karst  from 
Pistacia  atlantica  tree  [22,23].  We  have  reported  in 
previous  studies  that  the  isolation  method  of  hispidin, 
and this latter had anti-lipase activity [23-25]. It can be 
found  in  medicinal  mushrooms  such  as  Inonotus  and 
Phellinus  [26,27].  It  has  been  reported  that  hispidin 
exhibit antiviral activity [28].  

The seeds of Lepidium sativum are a rich source of 
alkaloids [29]. Lepidine B and E are major compounds 
with 1.1% and 0.88 % respectively. In a previous study, 

it has proved that Lepidine B and E have antimicrobial 
activity [30]. 
Curcumin 

(1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-
1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione)  is  a  main  phytochemical  of 
Curcuma longa L. rhizome (turmeric) [31]. It has been 
demonstrated that curcumin has a wide range of antiviral 
activity  against  different  viruses  including  inhibitory 
effect of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases [31-33]. 

This study aims to identify potent inhibitors for 2019-
nCoV main protease for designing and developing drugs 
against the viral infection.

2.  Materials and Methods 

2.1 Sequence Alignment of Main protease 

PDB  and  Sequence  files  of  genomes  and  main 
protease  (6lu7  and  1q2w)  was  download  from  the 
Protein  Data  Bank  (PDB)  [34-36],  where  6lu7  is  the 
protein sequence of 2019-nCoV and 1q2w is the protein 
sequence  of  SARS-CoV.  We  have  conducted  a  brief 
Alignment  of  two  structures  of  Mpro:  6lu7  and  1q2w, 

using  Similarity  Matrix:  BLOSUM62,  and  BioEdit  as 
software [37]. 

2.2 Molecular docking 
The inhibitory effect of studied compounds on 3CL 
protease was investigated by blind and specific docking 
experiments.  All  molecules  were  obtained 
from 
PubChem  database  [38],  the  2D  structures  of  studied 
molecules are represented in figure1. The PDB file of the 
enzyme (PDB ID: 6LU7) was download from the Protein 
Data Bank (PDB) [36]. 

 
 
 
 
Figure1. 2D structure of studied molecules. 

 
 
 
For  docking,  the  protein  must  be  prepared  by 
removing  all  water  molecules,  heteroatoms,  any 
ligands  and  co-crystallized  solvent.  Polar  hydrogens 
and partial charges were added to the structure using 
Autodock tools (ADT) (version 1.5.4). Co-crystallized 
inhibitors have been removed. Molecular docking was 
performed by the AutoDock Vina program [39] in an 
eight  CPU  station.  The  software  uses  rectangular 
boxes  for  the  binding  site,  the  center  of  the  box  has 
been set and displayed using ADT. The box grid for 
6LU7  in  blind  and  specific  docking  where  sets  as 
presented in Table 1 with one Å separated grid points 
positioned in the middle of the active site. The default 
settings were used, except that the  number of output 
conformations was set to one. The number of docking 
runs  was  set  at  50  runs.  The  number  of  solutions 
obtained  is  equal  to  50  conformations.  All  these 
solutions are very well handled. The "random seed" is 
random.  The  preferred  conformations  were  those  of 
lower  binding  energy  within  the  active  site.  Finally, 
the generated docking results were directly loaded into 
Discovery Studio visualizer, v 4.0 [23,40,41].

4.  Discussion 

Chymotrypsin-like  protease  (3CLpro)  called  also 
the  main  protease  (Mpro)  [43]  is  suggested  to  be  a 
potential  drug  target  to  combat  2019-nCoV.  With  a 
view  to  identify  inhibitors  of  2019-nCoV  Mpro, 
twenty-one  drugs  were  selected  based  on  their 
structure and the conformation of Mpro active site. As 
presented in table 2 and 3, the results show that three 
molecules (hispidin, lepidine E and folic acid) could 
bind  tightly  with  the  enzyme.  His41,  Cys145,  and 
Glu166 are important residues in the substrate‐binding 
subsite  S1  for  the  proteolytic  activity  [44],  the 
involvement  of  these  residues  in  forming  hydrogen 
bonds  is  important  for  the  inhibitory  effect  of  the 
Mpro. The molecular docking study demonstrated that 
most of studied molecules bind with one or more of 
these residues. 

The  best  molecule  is  hispidin.  The  blind  docking 
shows that 100% of poses are in the active site, those 
poses  share  the  same  position  and  interactions  with 
2019-nCoV  protease  residues  (Fig.3  (d)).  The 
predicate binding affinity to the 2019-nCoV protease 
is  -7.2  Kcal/mol.  Hispidin  forms  a  strong  hydrogen 
bond network with nCoV-2019 protease, six hydrogen 
bonds have been observed in both blind and specific 
docking.  The  strongest  hydrogen  bond  (1.77Å)  is 
formed by the hydroxyl group of the benzene ring of 
hispidin  and  CO  of  Leu141.  Hydroxyl  groups  of 
hispidin  and  residues  Leu141,  Ser144,  Cys145  and 
Met165  of  2019-nCoV  protease  form  the  other 
hydrogen  bonds.  No  hydrophobic  interactions  have 
been recorded. 

The  second  molecule  is  lepidine  E, 76% of poses 
are in the active site. We ran specific docking to study 
the binding mode of lepidine E in the active site (Fig.3 
(b)).  Lepidine  E  bind  tightly  with  the  2019-nCoV 
protease residues with a binding affinity -7.8 kcal/mol. 

 
A  very  strong  and  short  hydrogen  bond  has  been 
observed between hydroxyl groups of lepidine E and 
Leu141  with  length  of  1.64Å  and  1.74Å  in  blind 
docking  and  specific  docking  respectively.  Which 
mean  it  can  form  a  covalent  bond  that  may  lead  to 
irreversible inhibition. The other atoms of lepidine E 
forms  hydrogen  bond  with  2019-nCoV  protease 
residues, whereas, NH of both imidazole rings bind to 
Oxygen  atom  (of  main  chain)  of  Thr24and  His164 
(with interatomic distances “ID” of 2.32 and 2.38Å). 
Oxygen  atom  and  hydroxyl  group  interact  with  NH 
main group of Gly143 and Cys145 forming hydrogen 
bond with length of 2.88 and 3.38Å, respectively. This 
binding  supported  by  hydrophobic  interactions  with 
Thr24, Leu27 and His41 by means Π-sigma, Π-alkyl, 
and  Π-Π-stacked,  respectively.  It  is  noticed  that 
lepidine B bind to 2019-nCoV protease differently, the 
hydrogen bonds are of length 2.7, 2.9 and 3.09Å with 
His164, His163, and Glu166 respectively (Fig.3 (a)). 
The  third  best  molecule  is  folic  acid.  The  blind 
docking shows that 90% of poses are in the active site 
with  a  binding  affinity  of  -7.6  kcal/mol.  Different 
positions  have  been  recorded  in  specific  docking. 
Despite  this,  we  observe  that  all  positions  contain 
hydrogen bonds, from 5 to 11 hydrogen bonds in one 
position.  In  the  most  frequented  pose,  we  record  6 
hydrogen bonds (Fig.3 (c)).  The strongest hydrogen 
bond (1.74Å) between this molecule and the protease 
is the carboxyl group of the molecule and the oxygen 
atom of Thr190 in the main chain. The carboxyl group 
of the molecule also forms hydrogen bond with N in 
the  side-chain  of  the  residue  Gln192  (2.88Å).  The 
additional hydrogen bonds are as follows: NH2 of the 
molecule with CO of Thr26, NH with CO of Glu166, 
and  N  of  the  pteridine  ring of  folic  acid bind  to  NH 
main  group  of  Ser144  and  Cys145.  These  hydrogen 
bonds lead to a strong binding of 2019-nCoV protease 
binding site. 

In  PDB  file  of  crystal  structure  of  main  protease 
with the inhibitor, we observed that the inhibitor was 
bind  weaker  than  our  molecules.  It  forms  nine 
hydrogen  bonds  with  2019n-CoV  main  protease’s 
residues:  Phe140,  Gly143,  His163,  His164,  Glu166, 
Gln189, and Thr190. All hydrogen bond’s length was 
higher  than  2Å.  The  shortest  hydrogen  bond  was 
between His163 and PJE5 of the inhibitor with length 
of 2.43Å. 

Curcumin shows also a strong binding affinity with 
-7.5  kcal/mol.  In  most  repeated  pose  (90%),  four 
hydrogen  bonds  have  been  formed  with  Gly143  and 
Ser144 (2.96-3.38 Å). It has been found that curcumin 
has an inhibitory effect against  of HIV-1 and HIV-2 
proteases [31-33]. 

Colchicine,  febuxostat,  aloxistatin,  DHPEHP,  and 
β-carboline  derivatives  bind  strongly  in  the  binding 
site of 2019-nCoV protease. β-carboline was stabilized 
in the active site mostly by hydrophobic interactions. 
The binding affinity was -6.9 to -5.7 Kcal/mol except 
DHPEHP where the binding affinity was -7.2, but the 
length of the hydrogen bonds was always bigger than 
2Å.  No  hydrogen  bond  was  formed  with  colchicine, 
Harmaline,  Harmane,  Harmine,  Harmol,  Methoxy, 
and Norharman. 

Since publishing the crystalized structure of 2019-
nCoV  main  protease,  many  preprint  papers  have 
performed insilico studies for identify an inhibitor for 
it. A number of  1903  drugs were tested as the Mpro 
inhibitors  in  a  preprint  manuscript,  among  them, 
Nelfinavir  was  proposed  to  be  potential  inhibitor 
against  2019-nCoV  [45].  In  another  study,  it  was 
found by screening 8,000 clinical drug libraries that 4 
small molecular drugs have high binding capacity with 
the  main  protease  [46].  No  binding  manner  or 
hydrogen bonds formation with active site residues has 
been discussed in these studies. It was declared that 10 
commercial medicines may form hydrogen bonds with 
key  residues  of  2019-nCoV  main  protease  [47]. 
in  Nature 
According 
to  articles  published 
Communications  and  Nature 
reviews  drug 
discovery (Sheahan et al, 2020 and Guangdi et al, 
2020) 
four  drugs 
(Ritonavir, Darunavir, cobicistat, and ASC09F) are 
considered for treatment of 2019-nCoV as 3CLpro 
inhibitors.  Through  this  study,  we  recommend  to 
enter  these  molecules  (Hispidin,  Lepidine  E  and 
Folic acid) in the therapy of this disease especially 
that  the  studied  molecules  are  known  and  all  the 
necessary  clinical  experiments  are  already  done, 
for  the  natural  compounds,  they  are  used  in  folk 
medicine to treat several diseases.

Conclusions 

We have found that hispidin, lepidine E, and folic 
acid  display  a  strong  inhibitory  activity  on  3CL 
enzyme,  which  prevents  spreading  the  infection  by 
stopping  the  virus’s  cycle  life.  Based  on  this  study's 
results  and  other  previous  studies,  we  propose  a 
therapeutic  strategy  to  prevent  and  treat  the  virus 
infection.  The  potent  metabolites  hispidin  and  folic 
acid  that  inhibits  the  main  protease  of  2019-nCoV 
might  be  an  effective  strategy  to  treat  2019  novel 
coronavirus 
individuals.  Those  natural 
molecules also might become drug candidates as anti- 
CoViD-19 drug.
