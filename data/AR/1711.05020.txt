Controlling the state of a Bose-Einstein condensate driven by a chirped frequency perturbation in a
one-dimensional anharmonic trapping potential is discussed. By identifying four characteristic time
scales in this chirped-driven problem, three dimensionless parameters P1,2,3 are deﬁned describing
the driving strength, the anharmonicity of the trapping potential, and the strength of the particles
interaction, respectively. As the driving frequency passes the linear resonance in the problem, and
depending on the location in the P1,2,3 parameter space, the system may exhibit two very diﬀerent
evolutions, i.e. the quantum energy ladder climbing (LC) and the classical autoresonance (AR).
These regimes are analysed both in theory and simulations with the emphasis on the eﬀect of the
interaction parameter P3. In particular, the transition thresholds on the driving parameter P1 and
their width in P1 in both the AR and LC regimes are discussed. Diﬀerent driving protocols are also
illustrated, showing eﬃcient control of excitation and de-excitation of the condensate.

INTRODUCTION

Unique properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC)
attracted enormous interest in the last decades as a very
ﬂexible framework for experimental and theoretical re-
search in many-body physics and a promising basis for
new technologies. Modern applications require under-
standing of nonlinear dynamics of the condensates. Non-
linear dynamics is especially interesting in anharmonic
trapping potentials, when motion of the center of mass
is coupled to internal degrees of freedom [1], and may
even become chaotic [2]. In this paper we take advan-
tage of the anharmonic potential to excite a quasi-one-
dimensional condensate from the ground state to a high
energy level. The basic idea is to use a driving pertur-
bation with a slowly varying frequency to transfer the
population from the ground quantum state to the ﬁrst
excited state, then to the second, and so on. This dy-
namical process, when only two energy eigenstates are
resonantly coupled at a time, is the ladder climbing (LC)
regime.

The classical counterpart of the ladder climbing is the
autoresonance (AR), the phenomenon discovered by Vek-
sler and McMillan in 1944 [3] and referred to as the phase
stability principle at the time. Nowadays, the AR has
multitude of applications in such diverse areas as hydro-
dynamics [4–6], plasmas [7–9], magnetism [10–12], non-
linear optics [13], molecular physics [14], planetary dy-
namics [15] etc. The AR in BECs was previously studied
in [16] for the case of oscillating scattering length. The
excitation of a BEC from the ground state to the ﬁrst

which describes a BEC in a trap with the anharmonic
potential U (x, t) perturbed by a small amplitude oscil-
lating drive. Here β > 0 is the anharmonicity param-
eter assumed to be small. The frequency of the drive
αt slowly decreases in time (α > 0)
ω(t) = ˙ϕ(t) = ω0 −
and passes through the linear resonance frequency ω0 in
the problem at t = 0. We assume that the wave function
is normalized to unity and, thus, parameter g is propor-
tional to the total number of particles in the condensate.
Both the classical AR and the quantum LC in the lin-
ear limit (g = 0) of Eq. (1), i.e., the quantum Duﬃng
oscillator, were studied in Refs. [14, 19–21].

In this work, we focus on the nonlinear eﬀects due to
the interaction of the particles in the condensate. As a
[19] to
ﬁrst step, we adopt the notations used in Ref.
allow comparison with the linear case. To this end, we
classify diﬀerent dynamical regimes of Eq. (1) in terms
of parameters P1, P2 used in Ref.
[19] and introduce
a new parameter P3, characterizing the nonlinearity in
the problem. These parameters are constructed using
four characteristic time scales in the problem: the inverse
Rabi frequency TR = √2m~ω0/ε, the frequency sweep
time scale TS = α−1/2, the anharmonic time scale TA =
3~β/(4mα) of the trapping potential, and the nonlinear
~/mω0 is the
time scale TN = g/(~αℓ), where ℓ =
characteristic width of the harmonic oscillator. Time TA
is the time of passage of the frequency ω(t) through the

p

 
 
 
 
 
 
anharmonic frequency shift between the ﬁrst two levels
of the energy ladder. Similarly, TN is the time of passage
through the nonlinear frequency shift. Then, our three
dimensionless parameters are deﬁned as

tionary terms in the driving and nonlinear components
in Eq. (6)) to get a dimensionless system

and characterize the strength of the drive, the anhar-
monicity of the trapping potential and the nonlinearity of
the condensate, respectively. We limit our discussion to
the case of the positive nonlinearity (repulsion), P3 > 0.
The scope of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we study
the dynamics of our system in the energy basis of the
quantum harmonic oscillator and ﬁnd a domain in P1,2,3
parameter space where the successive quantum energy
ladder climbing process takes place. In Sec. III, we dis-
cuss the opposite limit of semiclassical dynamics. The
details of our numerical simulations are presented in Sec.
IV and the conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.

II. QUANTUM LC REGIME

Here we focus on the LC regime, where the quantum
nature of the system is mostly pronounced. In this case,
it is convenient to express Eq. (1) in the energy basis of
the linear harmonic oscillator Ψ(x, t) =
n cn(t)ψn(x),

linear LZ model attracted signiﬁcant attention recently
[25–27], especially in the context of BECs in optical lat-

ation from the linear case is the breakdown of adiabatic-
ity due to the bifurcation of nonlinear stationary states
[28, 29]. In this paper we focus on another property of

This condition (10) shows that the AR is an essentially

A typical dynamics of the nonlinear LZ model is illus-
trated in Fig. 1. For a given nonlinearity P3, the thresh-
old condition (10) separates two diﬀerent types of evolu-
tion of the system. If P1 < P1,cr (see Fig. 1a), the pas-
50
sage through the resonance at τ
yields a small excitation and a fast growth of the phase
mismatch δ between the two states (see solid line in Fig.
1a). In contrast, we observe synchronization and nearly
complete transition between the states when the coupling
parameter exceeds the threshold, P1 > P1,cr. Figures 1b
and 1c illustrate this eﬀect just beyond the threshold and
far from the threshold, respectively. One can see that
above the threshold the phase mismatch is bounded, ex-
hibiting the phase-locking phenomenon characteristic of
the AR. One can also see that the amplitudes vary sig-
niﬁcantly during the transition from n
1 to n state.
The phase-locking is destroyed only after the system al-
most completely transfers to the new state. As long
as the phase-locking is sustained, the population imbal-
ance increases on average as S(τ )

The numerical integration of the nonlinear LZ model (8)
gives the transition probability shown in Fig. 2. The
curve corresponding to P3 = 0 coincides with the lin-
ear LZ result (11). The transition probability steepens
as the nonlinearity P3 increases and tends to a step-like
function in the strongly nonlinear limit. The front of this

step corresponds to the onset of the AR at P1 ≈
Once phase-locked, the system remains in this state until
almost complete population inversion is achieved, as in-
dicated by transition probability (the height of the step)
close to unity in Fig. 2. This means that the threshold
(10) obtained in Ref. [13] in a small-amplitude limit, i.e.
assuming S
1, is applicable to the fully
nonlinear equations (9) as well.

For interpreting numerical simulations covering both

transition probability, i.e., Wn(P1,cr) = 1/2. Using this
deﬁnition we numerically solve Eq.(8) to ﬁnd the thresh-
old values P1,cr and compare these results with the the-
oretical prediction (10) in Fig. 3. One can see that in

The equation W (P1, P3) = 1/2 deﬁnes the threshold
P1,LC (P3) for this LC process. As it was found numer-
ically [19] in the linear P3 = 0 case, the product (12)
quickly converges for N > 5 and one ﬁnds P1,LC ≈
0.79.
On the other hand, in the strongly nonlinear limit one can
approximate the transition probability by the Heaviside
step function Wn(P1, P3)
P1,cr(P3, n)), where
P1,cr is given by Eq. (10). Since P1,cr decreases with the
transition number n and every transition leads to nearly
complete population inversion, the product (12) can be
replaced by the single n = 1 term W
W1 and the cap-
ture into the LC regime occurs after the ﬁrst transition.

Note that the threshold width, deﬁned as the inverse
slope of the transition probability at W = 1/2, equals
∆P1,LC = 0.66 in the linear case [19] and tends to zero
in the strongly nonlinear regime.

Similarly to the linear case, we can assume that the
successive transitions in the nonlinear regime will be well-
separated provided the time between two successive tran-
f1K1P3. This esti-
sitions satisﬁes ∆τ

mate can be simpliﬁed because f1 =

the linear result (7) we ﬁnd the condition for essentially
quantum dynamics in the P1,2,3 parameter space:

1 + P1 + 0.1P3.

(13)

This inequality together with the condition P1 > P1,LC
deﬁnes the region of the parameter space, where eﬃcient
excitation of quantum states in the model (1) via the
autoresonant LC is achieved.

III. SEMICLASSICAL REGIME

If the anharmonicity parameter P2 of the trap de-
creases, the two-level approximation employed in the pre-
vious section breaks down as several levels can resonate
1, the
with the drive simultaneously. In the limit P2 ≪
number of coupled levels is so large that the dynamics
becomes semiclassical. The linear P3 = 0 case in this
problem was already studied in Ref. [19]. It was shown
that the autoresonant excitation of BEC oscillations is
possible provided the drive strength P1 exceeds the clas-
sical autoresonance threshold for the Duﬃng oscillator
[30]

P1,AR =

0.82
√P2

.

(14)

In this regime, the center of mass of the condensate oscil-
lates in the trap with an increasing amplitude. The fre-
quency of these oscillations remains close to the driving
frequency during the whole excitation process, despite
the variation of the driving frequency. In this section we
discuss the threshold value P1,AR in the nonlinear case
P3 > 0.

the nonlinearity (characterized by parameter P3) in the
semiclassical regime does not aﬀect the evolution of the
maximum. Then it also does not change the threshold
of the AR (14) and should not shift the transition prob-
ability versus P1 in contrast to the quantum regime (see
Fig. 2). We conﬁrm these conclusions in numerical sim-
ulations in the following section.

classical autoresonance threshold (14) is shown by the
black long-dashed line. The two roughly horizontal lines
P2 = 1 + P1 + 0.1 P3 separate the regions of the quantum
and semiclassical dynamics in the linear (P3 = 0, red line)
and nonlinear (P3 = 100, blue line) regimes. The vertical
lines show the theoretical LC transition thresholds P1,LC
for the linear and nonlinear regimes.

One can see that the classical AR threshold (14) yields
a good approximation for the transition boundary for P2
versus P1 in both the linear and the nonlinear cases. In
the case P3 = 100, the nonlinear ladder climbing transi-
tions emerge at signiﬁcantly smaller values of the driving
parameter P1 and larger anharmonicity P2, compared to
the linear case. This is in agreement with the shift of the
threshold in the nonlinear model of the autoresonant LZ
transitions discussed above (see Fig. 2).

The important change due to the nonlinearity in the
problem is the decrease of the width of the transition re-
gion. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 5 for the case of the
semiclassical autoresonant transition. The width of the
transition for the nonlinear case decreases rapidly with
the increase of the nonlinearity parameter P3 and the
transition probability assumes a nearly step-like shape
for P3 > 15. One also observes that the threshold lo-
cation, where the probability crosses 50%, only slightly
changes with the variation of P3 as discussed at the end
of Sec. II.

The eﬀect of the narrowing of the transition width in
the semiclassical regime with the increase of the nonlin-
earity parameter can be associated with the improved
stability of the autoresonant classical trajectories de-
scribed by Eq. (17) . Indeed, in dimensionless variables,

We show in the Appendix that this equation predicts
parametric-type instability for P3 = 0 and we attribute
the existence of the width in the transition to autores-
onance as seen in Fig. 5 to this eﬀect. Note that the
κQ3 in the last
addition of the nonlinearity (the term
equation) shifts the eigenfrequency so that the paramet-
ric resonance can be avoided and characteristic trajec-
tories with nearby initial conditions remain close to the
classical autoresonant trajectory, narrowing the transi-
tion width as seen in Fig. 5. For the parameters in
this ﬁgure, the system stabilizes at P3 > 0.3 (see the
Appendix). Nonetheless, the deviation from the autores-
onant state is still large until P3 > 10, when the autores-
onant transition width practically disappears.

Our next numerical simulation shows that the system
can be fully controlled by the AR in both the quantum
and semiclassical regimes. Two protocols of such a con-
trol of the LC dynamics are shown in Fig. 6. Parameters
Pi are chosen so that both condition (13) and P1 > P1,LC
are satisﬁed. Due to a relatively strong anharmonicity,
the nonlinear LZ transitions are well separated in time.
One can see that the energy in the system grows step-

chirp rate α [red dashed line in Fig. 6(a)] results in the
excitation of the condensate to the sixth energy level. In
the second protocol (solid line) we ﬁrst excite the sys-

and ﬁnally return the system to the ground state by in-
creasing the driving frequency back to its original value.
One can see that the quantum state of (1) can be eﬃ-
ciently controlled as long as the LC autoresonant condi-
tions are met and the frequency and phase of the driving
are continuous. The quantum state in the ﬁrst protocol
105 is further illustrated in Figs. 6 (b) and
at T = 2
(c) showing the distribution of populations of diﬀerent
levels and the Wigner function. Small deviations of the
solution from the fourth eigenfunction χ4(ξ) of the linear
harmonic oscillator are due to the anharmonicity and the
nonlinearity in the problem.

A similar control protocols for the semiclassical case
are illustrated in Fig. 7. One can see that resulting
wave function has a Gaussian (Poissonian in the early
stages of dynamics) population distribution, characteris-
tic of coherent states. The Wigner function is positive
everywhere (on the computational grid) and close to the
n-squeezed coherent state. The second protocol (solid
line in Fig. 7) demonstrates that a more complex control
scenarios are possible in the semiclassical case, as long as
the driving parameter is within the region of autoreso-

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have studied the eﬀect of the parti-
cles interaction on the excitation of Bose-Einstein con-
densate in a anharmonic trap under chirped-frequency
perturbation. We have identiﬁed three dimensionless pa-
(3)] characterizing the driv-
rameters P1,2,3 [see Eqs.
ing strength, the anharmonicity and the strength of the
interaction to show that there exist two very diﬀerent
regimes of excitation in this parameters space, i.e., the
quantum-mechanical ladder climbing (LC) and the semi-
classical autoresonance (AR). The transition boundary
to the semiclassical AR in the P1,2 parameter space is in-
dependent of the nonlinearity parameter P3. In contrast,
the LC transition boundary is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by

sical regime for parameters ˜α = 10−6, P1 = 1.6, P2 = 0.3,

ond scenario (solid line) the frequency chirp is set to zero from

the strength of the interaction of the particles, because
the underlying nonlinear Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions
behave diﬀerently than their linear counterpart. In the
limit of strong interaction, the nonlinear LZ transition
probability as a function of the driving strength param-
eter P1 approaches the Heaviside step function due to
the nonlinear phase-locking. We have also found that
in both the quantum and the semiclassical regimes the
width ∆P1 of the transition decreases as the strength of
the interaction increases. In the quantum limit this ef-
fect is related to the autoresonance of the nonlinear LZ
transitions, while in the semiclassical limit, the eﬀect is
due to the wave packet stability enhancement by avoiding
parametric resonance between the center-of-mass motion
and the internal dynamics of the condensate.

Possible applications of the results of this paper may
include a control of the quantum state of BECs and the
implementation of precision detectors based on either the
LC or the AR. Unlike the noninteracting case [33], the
resolution of such a detector is not limited by quantum
ﬂuctuations if the particles interaction is strong enough.

We are interested in passage through resonance when pa-

In both of these cases,
Φ slowly increases initially and then passes π/2. Then

stable only if Φ < π/2 and, since we approach this value
in the vicinity of the threshold as mentioned above, one
encounters instability near the threshold, explaining the
appearance of the width of the autoresonant transition
as some initial conditions dephase. On the other hand, a
suﬃciently large κP3 stabilizes the solution and the width
of the autoresonance threshold disappears. For the pa-

rameters of Fig. 5 one ﬁnds that the solution is stable for
P3 > 0.27. Finally we check these conclusions by solving
the set (21) and (22) numerically. The results of these
