Ocean ventilation is the integrated eﬀect of various processes that propagate surface properties to
the ocean interior. Its precise understanding is the prerequisite for addressing essential questions such
as oxygen supply, the storage of anthropogenic carbon and the heat budget of the ocean. Currently
employed observational methods to infer ventilation utilise transient tracers, i.e. tritium, SF6, CFCs
and the radioisotope 14C. However, their dating ranges are not suitable to resolve the dynamics of
the deep ocean. The noble gas isotope 39Ar with a half-life of 269 years ﬁlls this gap. Its broad
application has previously been hindered by its very low abundance, requiring at least 1000 litres
of water for dating. Here we report on successful 39Ar dating with only 5 litres of water based on
the atom-optical technique Atom Trap Trace Analysis. Our data reveal previously not quantiﬁable
ventilation patterns in the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic, where we ﬁnd that advection is more
important for the ventilation of the intermediate depth range than previously assumed. This result
implies faster ventilation than estimated in other studies and thus a signiﬁcantly higher anthropogenic
CO2-storage. The demonstrated analytical capabilities now allow for a global collection of 39Ar data,
which will have signiﬁcant impact on our understanding of ocean ventilation.

The well mixed surface layer of the ocean exchanges
properties with the atmosphere through air-sea gas ex-
change. Various processes such as advection and diﬀusion
are responsible for transporting surface waters with their
corresponding properties to the ocean interior. The inte-
grated eﬀect of such water mass propagation is termed
ocean ventilation. Knowledge of its temporal and spa-
tial variations is essential for a reliable prediction of the
Earth system’s response to climate change[1, 2]. Thus, a
systematic observation on a global scale is desired. With
the new capabilities reported here, this now appears to
be feasible.

the age of the water.

Quantifying ventilation implies an estimation of the
time since the water was last in contact with the atmo-
sphere, i.e.
It can be accessed
by observations of transient tracers which encode time
information via radioactive decay or a time dependent
input function[3]. The short atmospheric histories of
well-established transient tracers such as chloroﬂuorocar-
bons (CFCs) and sulfurhexaﬂuoride (SF6)[4] cover only
the last 70 years, preventing the dating of the slowly
ventilated part of the global ocean. There, time-scales
of approximately 1000 years are estimated from 14C
measurements[5]. However, these results are rather un-
certain due to the complex carbon dynamics, long air-sea
equilibration time and long half-life compared to ocean
ventilation. The chemically inert noble gas isotope 39Ar
with a half-life of 269 years has long been identiﬁed as the
ideal tracer for the time scales of deep ocean circulation[6–
10]. However, even though argon is a common gas in the
atmosphere, the desired 39Ar isotope is extremely rare,

due to its very low isotopic abundance of 8 × 10−16. The
corresponding low activity necessitates samples of ∼1000
litres of water for 39Ar detection by low-level counting
(LLC) of the radioactive decays[6, 10, 11]. This large sam-
ple size hinders routine measurements of ocean samples.
Here we show that our method for analysing 39Ar, which
we call Argon Trap Trace Analysis (ArTTA), reduces
the required water volume to 5 litres. This makes large
scale ocean surveys feasible as taking 5 litres of water
can be readily integrated into standard water sampling
procedures on research vessels.

ARGON TRAP TRACE ANALYSIS

For the detection of long-lived radioisotopes, it is more
eﬃcient to count atoms rather than radioactive decays[12].
For example, atom counting by accelerator mass spec-
trometry (AMS) dramatically reduced sample-size require-
ments for 14C dating. AMS is not easily applicable for
noble gases, yet atom counting and the related substantial
reduction of sample size becomes possible by employing
the modern atom-optical technique known as Atom Trap
Trace Analysis (ATTA). It utilises techniques from the
ﬁeld of atomic physics to detect rare isotopes down to
the 10−16-level. It exploits shifts of the optical resonance
frequency due to diﬀerent isotopic mass and nuclear spin.
The high background of abundant isotopes hinders selec-
tion by a single resonant excitation, but the sensitivity
is strongly enhanced by many cycles of photon absorp-
tion and subsequent spontaneous emission. Therefore,
ATTA’s outstanding isotopic selectivity is based on mil-
lions of resonant photon scattering events required for
cooling, trapping and detecting single atoms inside a

Figure 1. 39Ar concentrations in percent of modern Argon (pmAr) for diﬀerent depths in the Eastern Tropical
North Atlantic. Each sample was analysed with at least two independent measurements and the horizontal error bars represent
the uncertainties of the combined single measurements. The sensitivity and eﬃciency of ArTTA allows for a full depth proﬁle
from just one CTD-cast corresponding to sample sizes as small as 5 litres of water. For comparison, three historic (1981) data
points[11] from two speciﬁc sites are included; the required 1000 litres for LLC analysis were obtained by combining four 250
litres sampling bottles integrating over a depth range of 600 to 800 meters (vertical error bars).

magneto-optical trap (MOT).

The general concept of ATTA has ﬁrst been demon-
strated for the rare isotopes 85Kr (half-life of 10.76 years)
and 81Kr (half-life of 229 000 years)[13, 14] and is ap-
plied for dating groundwater[15–17] and ice[18]. While
the ﬁrst 39Ar detection by this approach was reported
in a proof of concept experiment in 2011 [19], the ﬁrst
explicit demonstration for dating groundwater samples
was achieved in 2014 [20]. The ﬁrst apparatus used in
that study still required ∼1000 litres of water. Since then
the setup has been signiﬁcantly improved by doubling
the count rate, ensuring reliability and employing well
characterised enriched reference samples. The crucial step
for the reduction of the necessary sample size is the im-
plementation of gas recirculation in an optimised vacuum
system. With this ArTTA system, 39Ar quantiﬁcation is
now possible with only 2 mL STP of argon, which can be

extracted from 5 litres of water. Thus, a complete ocean
depth proﬁle of 39Ar can be sampled from one standard
hydrographic cast equipped with 10 L Niskin sampling
bottles, fulﬁlling the requirements for broader application
of 39Ar in oceanography[21].

39AR DEPTH PROFILES

Here we apply our new analytical capabilities to ex-
plore the ventilation regime in the Eastern Tropical North
Atlantic, in the context of investigations of the Oxygen
Minimum Zone in this region. In 2015, three depth pro-
ﬁles were taken with only one single hydrographic cast
per proﬁle during the research cruise M116 on research
vessel Meteor. Two proﬁles (#44, #55) originate from
the centre of the Oxygen Minimum Zone and one proﬁle

proﬁles of 39Ar on a linear and of CFC-12 on a logarithmic scale: Red markers for proﬁle #82, blue markers for the combined

system performance and the known systematic uncertainties. The solid and dashed grey vertical lines indicate the limits of
detection and quantiﬁcation, respectively. Panel b) illustrates how 39Ar (green) and CFC-12 (grey) data constrain possible
parameter combinations (Γ, ∆/Γ) of the IG-TTD given by their intersecting red area. Panel c) shows the corresponding
distributions. For comparison we add in the middle panel the distribution obtained using only CFC-12 data with the commonly
assumed ∆/Γ unity ratio.

(#82) from the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory[22] (Fig-
ure 1). The ocean water was sampled by closing three 10
litres Niskin bottles of a 24 bottle rosette per depth and
transferring ∼7 litres of the content of each Niskin bottle
into an evacuated 27 litres commercial propane gas bottle.
This way, 24 sampling containers ﬁlled with 20 litres of
water from eight diﬀerent depths at three sampling sites
were taken. Gas extraction from these samples followed by
argon separation resulted in a total argon yield between
5 and 8 mL STP, consistent with the temperature depen-
dent solubility[23]. Each sample was analysed by at least
two independent measurements, where the analytical un-
certainties are dominated by counting statistics. As seen
in Figure 1, we ﬁnd a clear decline in 39Ar-concentration
in the upper 1000 meters, a minimum at ∼3000 meters
and a slight increase towards the bottom at 4000 me-
ters. For comparison, we also include the three historic
39Ar samples closest to our sampling positions, which were
taken in 1981 and analysed by low-level counting[11]. The
observed diﬀerences in concentrations are consistent with
the known meridional gradients in tracer concentrations
characteristic for this region. Note that these historic 39Ar
data are integrated concentrations of a depth interval of
600 to 800 meters as indicated by the vertical error bars

due to the required large sample size of 1000 litres. The
ArTTA technique allows for 24 39Ar samples during one
single cast (with a “standard” 24 bottle rosette) that takes
∼3 hours of ship-time, which is about the same amount
of time needed for one large volume sample required for
LLC.

TRANSIT TIME DISTRIBUTION

In the following we discuss how the obtained 39Ar con-
centrations constrain the ventilation in this area. Since
ventilation always implies mixing along the ﬂow path, it is
adequate to describe a water sample by a distribution of
ages rather than one distinct age. One common assump-
tion is that this age distribution, known as Transit Time
Distribution (TTD)[24, 25], is described by the Inverse
Gaussian function (IG-TTD)[26], which is deﬁned by its
ﬁrst two moments: The mean of the distribution Γ and
the width of the distribution ∆

transport described by a one dimensional ﬂow model with
constant advective velocity and diﬀusivity. The ∆/Γ ratio
indicates the diﬀusive compared to the advective trans-
port characteristics of a water parcel; the lower ∆/Γ the
more dominant the advection. A ∆/Γ ratio of 0.4-0.8 indi-
cates an advectively dominated transport, whereas a high
ratio of 1.2-1.8 indicates transport dominated by diﬀusive
processes. Several approaches have been proposed for con-
straining the parameters of the IG-TTD based on tracer
data; here we use the method outlined and thoroughly
discussed by[27]. This approach is based on constraining
the TTD for each sample individually. Given a TTD
for a location in the ocean interior, the concentration at
sampling time ts and location r is described by

c (ts, r) =

Z ∞

0

c0 (ts − τ ) · e−λτ · G (τ, r) dτ

where c0 (ts − τ ) corresponds to the concentration at
source year ts − τ related to the input function of a
tracer. The exponential term accounts for the decay rate
of radioactive transient tracers. G(τ, r) is the Green’s
function of the ﬂow model for the given location[25], in
our case the IG-TTD. The two parameters of the IG-TTD
can be constrained using observed concentrations of at
least two transient tracers with suﬃciently diﬀerent time
information covering the expected age range of the water
parcel[3, 26].

As second independent tracer we choose CFC-12, which
was sampled at the same, or nearby, position. In Figure
2 a) the corresponding 39Ar and CFC-12 concentrations
are depicted and are well above the limit of quantiﬁcation.
The uncertainties of the 39Ar concentrations are limited
by the counting statistics and for CFC-12 by the sys-
tem performance of the on-board measurements and the
known systematic uncertainties. In Figure 2 b) we illus-
trate for three diﬀerent depths how both measured tracers
constrain possible parameter combinations (Γ, ∆/Γ). Con-
sidering the year of sampling and the input function of the
tracers, a particular tracer concentration can correspond
to a range of combinations of ∆ and Γ, which we plot as
∆/Γ vs. Γ [27]. For two (or more) independent tracers
multiple such curves can be analysed and the range of
possible combinations of ∆ and Γ can be constrained, as
indicated by the intersecting areas. The precision of the
results is limited by the combination of the uncertainty
of the input function (including saturation of the tracer
at water mass formation), and the analytical and inter-
polation uncertainties. For our study we assume for 39Ar
a constant input and for CFC-12 reported data for the
northern hemisphere[28]. In Figure 2 c) the corresponding
IG-TTDs are depicted.

IMPLICATIONS FOR VENTILATION REGIMES

The water column can be tied to diﬀerent regimes based
on ventilation as described by ∆/Γ ratios and mean ages
Γ (Figure 3 a and b) or by the dominant water masses as
illustrated by their salinity and temperature characteris-
tics (Figure 3 c). The water samples above ∼800 meters
correspond to the Atlantic Central Waters. Here we ﬁnd a
unity ratio ∆/Γ = 1 and mean ages consistent to estimates
based on the tracer couple SF6/CFC-12 for this ocean
region[29]. It is important to note that this regime is only
poorly constrained by 39Ar. For deeper and thus older
water the SF6/CFC-12 tracer couple is not applicable
for determining the age distribution, but 39Ar/CFC-12
gives new insights. For example, in intermediate depths
(1000-2000 meters), where Antarctic Intermediate Water
(AAIW) and Labrador Sea Water (LSW) dominate, we
ﬁnd ∆/Γ = 0.5 − 0.6 based on our data. This is in stark
contrast to the ∆/Γ unity ratio, which has been commonly
applied to this depth interval before[29–31]. Our ﬁndings
of these low ∆/Γ ratios reveal that the ventilation there
is of a more advective nature than previously assumed.
Additionally, the ﬁrst reliable mean ages Γ in this deeper
region can be derived due to the unique half-life of 39Ar
and increase with depth from 200 to 400 years (Figure
3 b). The deepest ventilation regime with ∆/Γ ∼ 0.9 is
found for water mainly composed of North Atlantic Deep
Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW).
We identify an increase in mean age up to Γ = 800 years
at 3000 meters depth, followed by a decrease towards
the ocean ﬂoor due to the better ventilated AABW. In
these areas the TTD can only be poorly constrained due
to low CFC-12 signals, resulting in large uncertainty of
the inferred mean age Γ = 810+1200
years for our oldest
−320
sample at 3000 meters depth. Alternatively, using the
extracted mean ∆/Γ ∼ 0.9 for the third ventilation regime
we ﬁnd Γ = 754+138
years based on our 39Ar data. Thus
−115
39Ar provides essential information on ventilation ages
for old waters.

BROADER IMPLICATIONS AND PROSPECTS

Once the age distribution of a water body is known, one
can derive concentrations of substances which have not
been or which cannot be measured directly, as long as their
input functions are known. An important factor in global
climate change is the storage of anthropogenic carbon
(Cant) by the ocean. In the studied area we ﬁnd a Cant
concentration within the AAIW/LSW range for proﬁle
#44/#55 at 1000 meters of ∼6.9 µmol kg−1, which is in
contrast to ∼3.8 µmol kg−1 using the commonly assumed
∆/Γ unity ratio. For the water column between 1000 and
2000 meters in ventilation regime II, this diﬀerence adds
up to ∼3 mol m−2 which should be compared to the total
column inventory of ∼25 mol m−2 [31].

The presented work is an example how applied quan-
tum technology developed in the context of fundamental

research in atomic physics contributes to the advance of
other ﬁelds, such as oceanography. The demonstrated
ArTTA method for small sample sizes makes the unique
time scale of 39Ar accessible for large scale ocean sur-
veys. This can increase our knowledge of ocean dynamics
signiﬁcantly and, with that, support ocean and climate
modelling. There are many other areas in environmental
sciences, such as glaciology, limnology and groundwater
research, where the novel analytical capabilities and much
smaller sample sizes will enable new applications and lead
to new insights.

Atom Trap Trace Analysis for argon with small
sample sizes

The basic concept of our atomic beam apparatus for
argon follows the established route [14, 19, 20] with some
modiﬁcations as mentioned below. It consists of a RF dis-
charge source, which prepares the atoms in the metastable
state necessary for laser cooling. The source is cooled
with liquid nitrogen to reduce the initial velocity spread of
the atomic beam. The divergent atomic beam, with a lon-
gitudinal mean velocity of 270 m s−1, is collimated with
transverse laser cooling in a tilted mirror setup and fo-
cused by a magneto-optical lens. Subsequently the atoms
with a maximum velocity of 600 m s−1 are longitudinally
slowed down in a 1.8 meters long increasing ﬁeld Zeeman
slower. The ﬁnal velocity of the atoms leaving the Zee-
man slower is around 70 m s−1 and is chosen above the
capture velocity of the MOT. Thus the atomic beam is
prevented to diverge rapidly at the end of the Zeeman
slower. An additional laser frequency builds a second lon-
gitudinal slowing stage together with the rising slope of
the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT. The atoms are refocused
there by the MOT and losses due to the divergence of
the atomic beam are reduced signiﬁcantly. Finally the
atoms are trapped inside the MOT and detected by their
ﬂuorescence with an avalanche-photodiode with a high
time resolution and spatially resolved on a CCD camera.
The detection threshold is set so that the rate of falsely
counted atoms due to background noise is kept below 1
atom in 100 hours. The corresponding detection eﬃciency
is 94 % of all trapped 39Ar atoms.

An additional 802 nm laser deexcites isotope-selectively
99 % of all metastable 40Ar atoms to the ground state,
which are responsible for half of the background light on
the single atom detection. The photons (843 nm) emitted
by the deexciting 40Ar atoms are detected by a photo-
diode which allows the monitoring of the atomic beam
ﬂux. Three diﬀerential pumping tubes together with
seven turbo molecular pumps build up a pressure gra-
dient from 4.8 × 10−6 mbar in the source chamber down
to 1.4 × 10−7 mbar inside the MOT. Thereby, the argon
throughput of the source is ∼50 mL STP per hour.

By closing the vacuum completely (i.e. the argon sam-
ple recirculates in the system and no roughing pump
removes gas from the system) the required sample size
can be reduced by more than two orders of magnitudes.
In this so called recycling or closed mode, the sample
circulates permanently inside the system. Outgassing
reactive gases, such as nitrogen and water, are removed
by a getter pump, which does not aﬀect noble gases. The
argon sample will remain in the vacuum chamber and
stays clean during the measurement process. A stable
operation over the required measurement time is possible
with samples sizes >1 mL STP of argon.

For further optimisation, the pressure inside the diﬀer-
ential pumping tubes was simulated by a Monte Carlo sim-

6

ulation. By doubling the total pumping speed we achieve
an atmospheric count rate of up to 7.0 atoms/hour, which
is an improvement by a factor of 2 compared to the count
rate reported previously[20].

Extraction and separation of argon

The propane gas bottles containing the collected water
samples were shipped to the laboratory in Heidelberg
where each sample was degassed and puriﬁed. The dis-
solved gas was extracted by shaking the sample container
and trapping the gas on a liquid nitrogen cooled activated
charcoal trap. After 15 minutes more than 95 % of the gas
is stored on the trap. In a second step, all reactive gases
are removed on a 900 ◦C titanium sponge getter, while
the released hydrogen is trapped on a second titanium
getter at room temperature. The ﬁnal gas fraction only
consists of noble gases, thus of >98 % argon. With a
getter capacity of about 8 L STP for the relevant reactive
gases, more than 10 samples of ∼50 litres of water can be
puriﬁed before having to replace the getter material.

Puriﬁcations of blank samples and helium leak tests
are performed regularly and showing that cross sample
contamination and leakage into the vacuum chamber is
negligible.

Two ocean samples were puriﬁed per day yielding be-
tween 5 to 8 mL STP of argon per sample with a purity
and extraction eﬃciency of >98 %.

39Ar-Analysis

The puriﬁed argon samples were analysed with the
atom optical detection technique ArTTA optimised for
39Ar and small sample sizes as described above. Our 24
hour measurement cycle consists of 20 hours of measur-
ing an ocean sample, followed by 2 hours of referencing
with an enriched sample of a well-known concentration
of 9.60+0.33
-times the atmospheric concentration. Finally
−0.31
the system is ﬂushed for one hour by running the dis-
charge source with krypton to avoid any signiﬁcant cross
sample contamination between the reference and the next
environmental sample. After 24 hours the next sample
is analysed. The currently achieved atmospheric 39Ar
count rate of up to 7.0 atoms per hour enables – depend-
ing on the sample concentration – up to 150 counts for
both the ocean sample and the reference within one day,
leading to 10 % uncertainty. For analysing the data, both
reference measurements before and after counting the
ocean sample are taken into account, resulting in an un-
certainty of about 7 % for the reference. Due to previous
optimisation and characterisation of the apparatus with
one million times enriched 39Ar samples more than ﬁve
years ago there is still a low but detectable contamination
present. This contamination together with a potential
cross sample contamination was quantiﬁed with 39Ar-free
underground samples originating from CO2 production

wells[32]. The measured count rates were corrected for
this eﬀect corresponding to about 10 atoms during a 20
hour measurement.

We apply a Bayesian approach for the analysis of the
39Ar-measurements. The reported concentrations are the
most probable values and the bounds of the one sigma
intervals contain most likely 68.3 % of the values.

CFC measurements

Two purge-and-trap gas chromatographic systems were
used for the measurements of the transient tracer CFC-12
during the cruise, slightly modiﬁed from [33]. The traps
for both systems consisted of 100 cm 1/16 00 tubing packed
with 70 cm Heysep D kept at temperatures between −60
and −68 ◦C during trapping. The gas was desorbed by
heating the trap to 130 ◦C and was passed onto the pre-
column consisting of 20 cm Porasil C followed by 20 cm
Molsieve 5A in a 1/8 00 stainless steel column. A 1/8 00

7

packed main column consisting of 180 cm Carbograph
1AC (60-80 mesh) and a 50 cm Molsieve 5A post-column
provided chromatographic separation. All columns were
kept at 50 ◦C and detection was performed on an Electron
Capture Detector (ECD).

The water samples for the determination of CFC-12
were collected in 250 mL ground glass syringes, of which
an aliquot of about 200 mL was injected to the purge-and-
trap system. Standardization was performed by injecting
small volumes of gaseous standard with the CFC-12 cali-
brated to the SIO98 scale. The precision was determined
to 8 fmol kg−1 and the limit of detection to 0.06 fmol kg−1.
Since we did not take samples for CFCs on the CTD casts
where we collected samples for 39Ar measurements, we
use nearby proﬁles that are comparable. Proﬁle #54 (N
11.00°, W 22.00°) was used to compare the CFC-12 val-
ues to the 39Ar proﬁles #44 (N 11.55°, W 23.00°) and
#55 (N 11.25°, W 22.00°). For proﬁle #82 (N 17.58°, W
24.30°) we used a CTD taken immediately prior on the

took place on diﬀerent CTD-casts, we interpolated the
CFC-12 data vs. density to match the 39Ar samples.
