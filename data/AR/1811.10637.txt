Recent JLAB measurements of inclusive (e,A) cross sections as a function of outgoing lepton
momentum may provide information on the nucleon spectral function in targets that will be relevant
for the planned DUNE neutrino long-baseline experiment. They also provide an important testing
ground for neutrino generators. We have therefore used the transport theoretical framework and
code GiBUU to calculate the cross sections for the targets C, Ar and Ti. We compare the calculations
with the experimental data. The overall agreement is good. Relatively small discrepancies appear
mainly on the low-electronenergy side of the QE-peak where QE and 2p2h excitation processes
overlap.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Among the top priorities in particle physics are the
precise determination of neutrino mixing angles, of the
mass-ordering and of the CP symmetry violation in weak
interactions. The experiment DUNE (Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment), with a beam originating at Fer-
milab and a far-detector located deep underground at the
Sanford Lab, about 1300 km away, will be at the forefront
of such studies for the coming two decades [1].

Crucial for the extraction of the aforementioned prop-
erties is the knowledge of the neutrino energy since it
enters explicitly into the oscillation formulas. As a con-
sequence, the accuracy with which the incoming neutrino
energy is known determines the accuracy of the extracted
neutrino properties. Unlike in any other experiment in
high-energy or nuclear physics the neutrino beam energy
is not sharp, but is known only within a fairly broad dis-
tribution. At DUNE, e.g., the energy distributions peaks
at about 3.5 GeV, with tails out to 30 GeV.

The neutrino energy is thus not ﬁxed by some acceler-
ator but must be obtained from an – often incomplete –
observation of the ﬁnal state of the neutrino-nucleus reac-
tion. The reconstruction of the neutrino energy amounts
to ’calculating backwards’ from an observed ﬁnal state.
This is the purpose of generators such as GENIE, NEUT
or NuWro [2]. These generators must be able to handle
not only the very ﬁrst, initial interaction of the incom-
ing neutrino with bound and Fermi-moving nucleons, but
also the often sizeable ﬁnal state interactions that the
hadrons, produced in the ﬁrst reaction, experience. The
quality and predictive power of the ’backwards calcula-
tion’ then depends critically on the quality of the under-
lying nuclear theory encoded in the generators [3].

A crucial test for the quality of generators is provided
by the description of electron interactions with nuclei

since these are sensitive to both the vector part of the
initial electroweak interaction and the same ﬁnal state
interactions. Although the neutrino experiments require
the knowledge of the ﬁnal state of the reaction, i.e. the
four-vectors of all particles present, for the energy recon-
struction a necessary test is already provided by inclusive
cross sections. The new experimental data from Jeﬀer-
son Laboratory, in which the inclusive cross sections were
measured on C and Ti [4] and Ar [5] at an energy of 2.222
GeV and a scattering angle of 15.541 degrees, provide
such a testing ground. So far, no theoretical descriptions
of all of these data were attempted; for C a calculation
using the spectral function (SF) method is shown in [4]
and for Ar the results of a calculation using the Rela-
tivistic Green’s Function (RGF) method only for the QE
peak are given in [5]. Generator comparisons with these
data are not available at all.

It is, therefore, the purpose of the present short paper
to describe the results obtained with GiBUU, a theory
and code framework for the description of nuclear inter-
actions with nuclei [6].

II. METHOD

We use GiBUU for the calculation of these inclusive
cross sections as a function of outgoing lepton energy,
i.e. essentially of the energy transfer. Unlike in neutrino
experiments, where this energy transfer is not directly
measurable, in electron experiments the energy-transfer
is an observable. GiBUU cannot only provide the in-
clusive cross sections discussed in this paper, but it also
describes the full time-development of a nuclear reaction,
giving at the end the four-vectors of all particles present
in the ﬁnal state. GiBUU can, therefore, also be used as
a generator.

We stress that all the subprocesses described in the fol-
lowing subsections consistently involve the same ground-
state of the target nucleus (with the exception of the

2p2h process where we rely on a phenomenological de-
scription). This consistency is not present in other gen-
erators; there pieces from diﬀerent theories are used for
the description of the various interactions. This combi-
nation of various ingredients in the description of one and
the same nucleus introduces artiﬁcial degrees of freedom.
For details we refer to the GiBUU review which con-
tains all the theoretical basis and information on the tech-
nical implementation [6]1. For the results to be discussed
in the following section no special tunes were used; they
were obtained ’out of the box’.

A. Ground State Potential

The GiBUU theory prepares the ground state by ﬁrst
calculating for a given realistic density distribution a
mean ﬁeld potential from a density- and momentum-
dependent energy-density functional, originally proposed
for the description of heavy-ion reactions [7]. The poten-
tial obtained from it is given by

which is explicitly momentum dependent. Here ρ0 is the
nuclear equilibrium density and f ((cid:126)r, (cid:126)p(cid:48)) is the nuclear

(2)
This same phase-space distribution and the momentum-
dependent potential also enter into the calculation of ma-
trix elements and transition probabilities. By an itera-
tive procedure we make sure that the Fermi-energy is
constant over the nuclear volume; the binding is ﬁxed to
-8 MeV for all nuclei.

The parameters appearing in this potential are given
for two diﬀerent parameter sets in Table I. Here the
parameterset labeled EQS5 is that used in all our for-
mer calculations of neutrino interactions with nuclei; it
was originally obtained from a ﬁt to heavy-ion data [8].

FIG. 1. The two potentials corresponding to the parame-
tersets EQS5 (solid) and EQS14 (dashed) at density ρ0 =
0.16f m−3 as a function of kinetic energy. EQS14 (dashed) is
obtained from a ﬁt to experimental pA data [9] at r = 0.

The other parameterset EQS14 approximates the poten-
tial obtained by Cooper et al from a ﬁt to p+A data
[9]. The two potentials are shown in Fig. 1 in their de-
pendence on momentum p. The potentials EQS5 and
EQS14 agree with each other in the kinetic energy range
100 < T < 300 MeV. For lower kinetic energies, corre-
sponding to lower energy transfers, EQS5 gives a better
description of the data (see the results shown in [10]).

This very same potential is present both for the initial
interaction as well as for the ﬁnal state propagation of
outgoing baryons. There is thus no need to invent ar-
tiﬁcial binding energy parameters as usually used in all
other generators which do not contain any nuclear bind-
ing [11]. We note that none of the other generators have
a potential for the outgoing particles implemented.
In
GENIE and NuWro a potential for the ﬁnal state phase
space of the ﬁrst, initial interaction can be added ’by
hand’. However, since their ﬁnal state propagation does
not allow for any potential this creates unphysical poten-
tial steps with corresponding spikes in the forces. In the
SF method the ﬁnal state potential is added by hand to
the initial process [12] by correcting only the ﬁnal state
phase-space. There is no consistency with the initial state
potential that is eﬀectively hidden in the SF.

B.

Inelastic Excitations

Inelastic reactions in GiBUU are described by the ex-
plicit treatment of nucleon resonances (for an invariant
mass W < 2 GeV) and their decay, based on the MAID07
analysis, and by DIS processes, as described by PYTHIA,
for higher W [13].

C. 2p2h Interactions

1 The code can be downloaded from gibuu.hepforge.org

In lepton interactions with nuclei also so-called 2p2h
processes can take place [14, 15]. Since there is no the-

EQS5EQS140.00.10.20.30.40.5-80-60-40-20020T[GeV]U[MeV]3

oretical framework available to calculate these processes
starting from the GiBUU ground state and for the kine-
matical regime relevant for DUNE we take this 2p2h con-
tribution from a global ﬁt to electron scattering data on
carbon over a wide kinematical range; for details see [10].
Since the MEC contributions are rather short-ranged we
take them directly proportional to the nuclear mass num-
ber A.

D. Final State Interactions

For inclusive cross sections ﬁnal state interactions play
a role only through the ﬁnal states of the very ﬁrst lepton-
nucleus interaction. We obtain these from the very same
potential as the one used for the construction of the
ground state, as explained above in Eq. (1).

FIG. 2. Inclusive cross section for (e,12C) at 2.222 GeV and
15.541 deg as a function of outgoing electron energy E(cid:48). The
various curves give the contributions of diﬀerent interaction
processes to the total. The data are taken from Ref. [4].

III. RESULTS

In Figs. 2, 3 and 4 we show the inclusive cross section
for the 3 targets 12C, 40Ar and 48Ti as a function of
outgoing electron energy. A ﬁrst look shows that the
agreement is quite good for all 3 targets over the full
kinematical range, as far as the general structure and
the overall magnitude of the cross section are concerned.

A. Comparison with experiment

In all three cases the agreement in the resonance region
is perfect. In the QE region, however, a discrepancy on
the left (lower electron energy) side of the QE peak shows
up. There the theory gives too much strength for energy
transfers of about 200 - 300 MeV. The results of a spectral
function method shown in Ref. [4] for 12C show a better
description of the QE peak, but worse agreement both in
the dip region and the high energy transfer region. The
results of a RGF calculation, shown in Ref. [5] for Ar,
describe the QE peak very well, but do not contain any
inelastic components.

We now discuss the observed discrepancy at the high-
energy-transfer side of the QE peak.
Its origin is nev-
ertheless not so clear since in this region the QE contri-
bution overlaps mainly with the 2p2h contribution and
– to a lesser extent – also with that of the ∆ excitation
and the pion background component. We note, ﬁrst, that
the agreement with data could be somewhat improved by
shifting the energy-transfer by only about 20 MeV. This
shift could be achieved by changing the momentum de-
pendence of the single particle potential. While in a QE
scattering process the initial nucleon has a low kinetic
energy below the Fermi-energy, after the energy transfer
of ≈ 350 MeV it is close to 400 MeV and thus sees a
much less attractive potential (see Fig. 1). Comparing
the uppermost solid (EQS14) and dashed (EQS5) curves

various curves give the contributions of diﬀerent interaction
processes to the total. The black solid line gives the total cross
section calculated with EQS14, the topmost dashed black line,
which nearly overlaps with the solid line, gives the total cross
section calculated with EQS5. The data are taken from Ref.
[5].

1. Z-Scaling

Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the total cross sections
for all 3 targets normalized to the target proton number.
The scaled cross sections are very close to each other for
all energies. This scaling with Z reﬂects the fact that all
reaction processes (QE, resonance excitations and 2p2h)
are all one-particle or short-ranged processes. The curves
for Ar and Ti are on top of each other while the curve for
C is somewhat narrower and higher in the QE peak; this
same behavior is also seen in the data (Fig. 2 in [5]).

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have compared the results of GiBUU
calculations with very recent inclusive electron scatter-
ing data on nuclei that were taken with an aim to pro-
vide a basis and crucial input for neutrino generators.
The comparison was done without any tuning and good
agreement was obtained. A persistent discrepancy at the
high energy-transfer side of the QE peak could possibly
be traced back to the momentum-dependence of the sin-
gle particle potential and/or to the behavior of the 2p2h
contribution that extends into the region of the QE peak.
In all three targets there is a signiﬁcant 2p2h strength al-
ready at energies below the QE peak; this will complicate
the extraction of the single-particle spectral function, one
of the original aims of the JLAB experiment.

Since the description of electron scattering data on nu-
clei is usually seen as a crucial test for generators the
comparison presented here is a ﬁrst step into that direc-
tion (see also the lower-energy comparisons in Ref. [10]).
It would be instructive to see also results of similar com-
parisons of the data with the results of other generators
as a ﬁrst, necessary test of their reliability.

V. NOTE ADDED IN PROOF

After this paper was uploaded to the arXiv we became
aware of results obtained with the GENIE generator by
A. Ankowski and A. Friedland [16]. Also, results of a
calculation using the SUSA scaling model have become
available in the meantime [17].

FIG. 5. Inclusive cross section per proton for (e,C), (e,Ar) and
(e,Ti) at 2.222 GeV and 15.541 deg as a function of outgoing
electron energy E(cid:48).

in Fig. 3 shows that the sensitivity of the calculated re-
sults to these equation of state is very weak, because both
potentials agree in the relevant kinetic energy range.

Furthermore, it is not clear if the observed discrepancy
is due to the QE process alone or whether the 2p2h con-
tribution, which is quite signiﬁcant in the lower-energy
region of the QE peak, also contributes to the observed
disagreement. We have, therefore, abstained from tuning
the potential to these kinematics since within the poten-
tial form of Eq. (1) and the constraints by the Cooper
potential it seems to be diﬃcult to maintain simultane-
ously the good agreement at the lower energies obtained
in [10].

Anyway, since the overall energy transfer here is about
350 MeV, the necessary correction amounts to only about
5 % of the energy transfer. This relatively small shift will
play an even smaller role in neutrino-induced reactions
where the energy transfer is smeared over because of the
width of the incoming neutrino energy distribution. Fur-
thermore, at the planned DUNE experiment the incom-
ing beam energy is higher than here so that DIS will play
a larger role. It is, therefore, encouraging to see that the
present calculations give perfect agreement in particular
in the region of large energy transfers.
