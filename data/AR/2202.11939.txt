Morphological and chemical structures of M33 are investigated with the LAMOST DR7 survey. Physical
parameters; extinction; chemical composition of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar (where available); and radial
velocities were determined for 110 nebulae (95 H II regions and 15 planetary nebulae) in M33. Among them, 8
planetary nebulae and 55 H II regions in M33 are newly discovered. We obtained the following O abundance

1. Introduction
M33 (NGC 598, Triangulum galaxy) is the third-largest
member of our Local Group of galaxies following the
Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way. Spectroscopic
studies of M33 started a long time ago, when the bright lines in
the nebulae were observed by Slipher (1915), Pease (1915),
and Hubble (1926). Almost 100 yr ago Edwin Hubble noticed
that the great angular diameter of M33 and its high degree of
resolution provide an exceptional opportunity for detailed
investigation. Therefore, M33 is still considered by astron-
omers as a perfect astrophysical laboratory for studying star
formation processes, stellar evolution, galacto-chemical evol-
ution, and the properties of the interstellar medium.

The distribution of chemical abundances in M33 and other
galaxies was originally investigated by Searle (1971). His
discovery of a negative metallicity gradient outward in spiral
galaxies subsequently has been conﬁrmed by numerous studies
(e.g., Pagel et al. 1979; Kwitter & Aller 1981; Garnett &
Shields 1987). The metallicity gradients have engaged much
attention, because they reﬂect the evolution of the galaxy and
can provide better understanding of complex processes, such as
star formation, stellar migration, gas ﬂows within the disk,
radial gas ﬂows, and metal-enriched gas outﬂows.

Chemical gradients are commonly tracked by measuring the
abundance of metals such as O, Ne, S, and Ar as a function of
galactocentric distance. Traditionally, oxygen is the most
common element for determination of the abundance gradient.
Oxygen abundances are well determined from ionic abun-
dances of O+ and O++, whose lines are observed in the visual

range of wavelengths. However, it should be noted that the
lines of
oxygen abundance measured from the spectral
planetary nebulae (PNe) could differ
from the oxygen
abundance of the preexisting gas out of which the progenitor
stars originated. Oxygen could be produced or destroyed in the
stellar progenitors. Delgado-Inglada et al. (2015) presented
evidence that oxygen can be produced at low metallicity, and
their analysis showed that argon and chlorine are the best
metallicity indicators of the progenitors of PNe.

There are many studies where metallicity gradients were
derived from H II regions, PNe, and massive supergiant stars in
M33, e.g., Monteverde et al. (1997), Urbaneja et al. (2005),
Crockett et al. (2006), U et al. (2009), Magrini et al. (2009),
Rosolowsky & Simon (2008), Magrini et al. (2010), Bresolin
et al. (2010), Bresolin (2011), Toribio San Cipriano et al.
(2016), Lin et al. (2017), and others. The best review of current
observational knowledge concerning the abundances of the
ionized gas (H II
regions and PNe)
in nearby galaxies,
including M33, and how they inform us about
the time
evolution of metallicity gradients can be found in Bresolin
(2015).

Magrini et al. (2009, 2010) claimed that H II regions and
PNe have oxygen gradients very close within the errors. Their
result was conﬁrmed by Bresolin et al. (2010), who found no
signiﬁcant oxygen abundance offset between PNe and H II
regions at any given galactocentric distance despite their
different age groups. It would be reasonable to expect that the
gradients obtained using H II regions and massive stars are the
same, since the two types of objects represent the same young
galactic population. Such a kind of comparison has been
carried out in M33, and a difference on the order of 0.2 dex was
reported in Bresolin (2015). The origin of this disagreement is
still not clear. Peña & Flores-Durán (2019) analyzed galacto-
centric radii and chemical abundances from the literature and

inferred that the metallicity gradients shown by PNe are ﬂatter
than those of H II regions.

The theoretical models of galacto-chemical evolution can
predict both directions of gradient evolution: the gradient could
become steeper or ﬂatter with time (Kang et al. 2012; Mollá
et al. 2019). There are many factors playing a role, such as gas
infall, gas outﬂow, and turbulence in the interstellar medium.
All these are based on observations of H II regions, PNe, and
massive stars representing different age groups in the evolution
of the galaxy. To infer a reliable chemical history of M33, a
larger and more homogeneous sample of H II regions, PNe, and
to get observational
B-type stars is demanded in order
constraints on the real gradients.

M33 is a spiral galaxy with SA(s)cd Hubble classiﬁcation.
Earlier studies of the structure of M33 are based on optical
images, e.g., Boulesteix et al. (1974), Sandage & Humphreys
(1980), where Sandage & Humphreys (1980) identiﬁed 10
spiral arms, ﬁve on each side of the center. In the optical bands,
M33 could be considered as a ﬂocculent spiral galaxy, while
UV and IR observations show more prominent arms. The spiral
structure of M33 has also been examined on the basis of 197
OB associations by Ivanov & Kunchev (1985). They pointed
out a system of seven spiral arms. Although there are many
recent studies about the spiral structure of M33 (e.g., Li &
Henning 2011; Kam et al. 2015), the arms are traced slightly
differently in various sources, and M33 does not have a clearly
deﬁned grand-design spiral pattern.

In this paper we present a spectroscopic study of M33 with
spectra obtained with the Guoshoujing Telescope (the Large
Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope,
LAMOST) from 2011 to 2018 yr. A large and homogeneous
sample of 110 nebulae (95 H II regions and 15 PNe) that
spreads over the whole M33 disk is investigated. More than a
half of all nebulae are investigated for the ﬁst time. The spectra
are analyzed to determine abundances of the elements He, N,
O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar represented by observed emission lines.
Different methods for calculating chemical abundances in
photoionized nebulae are employed: the direct method based
on the analysis of collisionally excited lines (CELs), and the
strong-line abundances with O3N2 and N2
method of
diagnostics and optical recombination lines (ORLs). We hope
that our study will help to shed light on the evolution of the
gradient of oxygen and other elements in M33.

The article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
observations, reduction techniques, and target selection. The
method of calculations is presented in Section 3. The radial
velocities of the sample nebula are calculated in Section 4.2. In
Section 4, we
and chemical
investigate morphological
structures of M33. Comparisons with the previous studies are
presented in Section 5. We summarize our conclusions in
Section 6.

2. Observations, Target Selection, and Classiﬁcation

The Large sky Area Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) is a 4.0 m telescope located at
the Xinglong
Observatory northeast of Beijing, China. The LAMOST survey
is a spectroscopic survey that eventually covers approximately
half of the celestial sphere and collects 10 million spectra of
stars, galaxies, and quasars (Zhao et al. 2006, 2012; Cui et al.
2012).

We checked 2154 LAMOST low-resolution (R ∼ 1800)
spectra at 3700–9099 Å from the DR7 release (observed from
2011 December to 2018 October) in the radius of
from the
center of the M33. A total of 110 high signal-to-noise ratio
nebular spectra were selected for further analysis. They were
divided into two groups: H II regions and PNe. Objects with
emission-line spectra were classiﬁed with the commonly used
Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich (BPT) criteria from Baldwin et al.
(1981) to distinguish the PNe and H II regions, and criteria
from Kauffmann et al. (2003) to distinguish the starburst and
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). It should be noted that other
classiﬁcation dividers are available in the literature (e.g.,
Kniazev et al. 2008; Sanders et al. 2012). The BPT diagram
with our objects is presented in Figure 1.

We have identiﬁed 95 H II regions and 15 PNe. The number
of H II regions is higher because H II regions are much larger
(∼10–30 pc) than PNe (∼0.1 pc), so the probability of ﬁnding
H II is higher during the survey. The whole sample of PNe and
H II regions is presented in Table 1, and their distribution in
M33 is plotted in Figure 2. We call regions “new” if there is no
previous classiﬁcation as an H II region or PN in the literature
for objects within the radius of 2″ (the site seeing of the
telescope). For regions that were classiﬁed in previous works,
we provide references in Table 1.

Recently, Zhang et al. (2020a) presented a catalog of Hα
emission-line point sources in the vicinity of M31 and M33
observed with LAMOST at the period from 2011 September to
2016 January. For classiﬁcation, Zhang et al. (2020a) adopted
the commonly used criteria from Baldwin et al. (1981) to
distinguish the PNe and H II regions and criteria from Sabbadin
et al. (1977), Canto (1981), and Riesgo & López (2006) to
separate the supernova remnants (SNRs) from PNe and H II

1000 cm−3. The extinction law of Howarth (1983) was
adopted for calculations of extinction coefﬁcients c(Hβ). The
subsequent extinction-corrected intensities were employed for
calculation of the electron densities (ne) and temperatures (Te).
Electronic density was derived from the intensities of the
sulfur-line doublet [S II] λλ6716, 6731 assuming a Te of 10,000
K. The scheme to calculate the densities and temperatures can
be found in Wesson et al. (2012).

For 6 PNe and 21 H II regions from our sample, low- and
high-excitation temperatures were calculated from the inten-
sities of several emission-line ratios. Electron temperature
Te[N II] was obtained from ratio [N II] λ5755/(λ6548 +
λ6584), Te[O II] from ratio λ3727/(λ7320 + λ7330), and
Te[O III] from ratio λ4363/(λ5007 + λ4959) (Osterbrock &
Ferland 2006). For
the remaining objects, a value of
Te = 10,000 K was assumed to calculate the chemical abun-
dances. Ionic abundances are calculated from CELs using the
ionization
temperature and density appropriate to their
[O I]
potential. We used (where available)
λλ6300, 6364, [O II] λλ3727, 7320, 7330, [O III] λλ4363,
4959, 5007, [N II] λλ5755, 6584, 6548, [Ne III] λ3869, [S II]
λλ4069, 4076, 6716, 6731, [S III] λλ6312, 9069, [Ar III]
λλ7136, 7751, and [Cl III] λλ5517, 5537. The ionic abundance
is adopted as a weighted average of the abundances from each
ion, if several lines from a given ion are presented.

the lines of

For helium, lines of He I λλ4471, 5876, 6678 were employed.
The tabulated emissivities for helium were adopted from Porter
et al. (2012). NEAT interpolates logarithmically in temperature and
density between the tabulated values to determine the appropriate
emissivity. The chemical abundances are determined by applying
the ionization correction factors (ICFs) for unseen ions following
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014). The classical ICF was applied for
nitrogen (N/O = N+/O+). For H II regions, oxygen abundances
were determined with two strong-line diagnostics: O3N2 and N2
employing the calibration formulae from Marino et al. (2013). The
validity intervals, −1.1 < O3N2 < 1.9 and −1.6 < O3N2 < −0.2,
were considered.

The error in ﬂux ±10% may led to error in temperature
±30 K. We estimated the uncertainties of the abundances by
propagation of the errors in line ﬂuxes ±10% and errors in
temperature ±500 K. The calculation was done for H II region
#45 with Te = 8333 K and ne = 56.9 cm−3 (Table 4). The total

regions. Some objects are common with the catalog of Zhang
et al. (2020a), for example, PNe: J013332.34+304240.3 (#4)
and J013302.02+301108.2 (#15); H II regions: J013439.00
+310231.0 (#21),
J013301.67
+303027.9 (#65), J013313.57+302236.3 (#82), and J013442.54
+305544.5 (#85). The nebula J013340.36+302001.6 (#84) was
classiﬁed as an H II region in our study. However, this nebula is
located very close to J013340.37+302001.6, which was classiﬁed as a
new SNR candidate in Zhang et al. (2020a), who employed an
additional classiﬁcation based on Frew & Parker (2010). We classiﬁed
J013402.76+303833.2 (#26) and J013350.88+303712.2 (#37) as
H II regions, while they were classiﬁed as PNe in Ciardullo et al.
(2004) and Magrini et al. (2000). Both regions are marked in Figure 1.

3. Method of Calculations

The adopted parameters of M33 and their references are
presented in Table 2. The identiﬁcation of the lines, ﬁtting with a
Gaussian proﬁle, and measurement of line intensities were done
employing FITYK software. Among 110 objects, 108 targets do not
contain stellar contamination. The spectra of the remaining two H II
regions (#46 and #110) are contaminated by broad emission lines
from ionizing central stars. These lines were subtracted during the
nebular ﬂux measurements. All spectra were corrected by
subtracting a globally ﬁtted continuum.

The subsequent plasma diagnostics and interstellar red-
dening were treated using the code NEAT3 (v.2.2) (Nebular
Empirical Analysis Tool; Wesson et al. 2012). Line intensities
were measured on scale Hβ = 100. The code NEAT corrects for
interstellar reddening using the ratios of the Hα, Hβ, Hγ, and
Hδ lines.
the lines are ﬁrst calculated
assuming a temperature of 10,000 K and a density of

The chemical abundances of O, He, N, Ne, S, and Ar as a
function of galactocentric distance (R/R25) are presented in
Figure 3. The chemical abundances obtained with the
Te-sensitive method in 21 H II regions were used for metallicity
gradient analysis. We ﬁt the relation between abundances, 12
+log(M/H) (where M = O, He, Ne, S, Ar), and R/R25 as a
ﬁrst-order polynomial, with Gaussian intrinsic scatter around
this line with standard deviation in the 12+log(M/H) direction.
This is accomplished using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) technique implemented in the EMCEE package of
PYTHON (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). Throughout this study
EMCEE is run using 50 walkers and 2000 steps. The chain for
all the parameters is inspected to check for convergence. Once
the chain has converged, the best ﬁts are presented in Figure 3,
where the shading areas represent the uncertainty around this
ﬁt. The uncertainty is taken as the difference between the 84th
and 50th percentile as the upper limit and the difference
between the 50th and 16th percentile as the lower limit. If the
posterior distributions follow normal (Gaussian) distributions,
then this equates to the 1σ uncertainty. Final chemical gradients
and 1σ uncertainties in H II regions are summarized in Table 5
and illustrated in Figure 4. The spatial distribution of chemical
abundances of O, He, Ne, S, Ar, and Cl (where available) in
M33 is presented in Figure 5.

The H II regions are relatively young objects. They are large,
massive (generally between 102 and 103 Me) regions of gas

regions. On the horizontal axis, each element and the diagnostic method are

that are ionized by the UV radiation emitted by recently formed
OB-type massive stars, luminous blue variables (LBVs), or
Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars with typical effective temperatures
between 25 and 50 kK. There are several known giant H II
regions in M33: NGC 604, NGC 595, VGHC 2-22 (NGC 592),
NGC 588 IC 131, and IC 142.

A total of 55 H II regions were discovered for the ﬁrst time in
this study. The new H II regions are marked in Table 1. Some
objects have combined spectra with both stellar and nebular
characteristics. For example, J013441.32+302811.6 (#23) is
an F-type star with nebular emission lines in spectra from an
H II region. J013348.14+303928.6 (#28) is a G-type star with

J013316.36+305320.5 (#32) is an A-type star with nebular
emission lines in spectra from an H II
region. Although
J013402.76+303833.2 (#26) was classiﬁed before as a PN
(Ciardullo et al. 2004), we classiﬁed it as an H II region based
on the BPT diagram (Figure 1).

PNe are expanding shells of the luminous gas expelled by
dying stars of low and intermediate masses. They stem from
objects that have lifetimes up to a gigayear. PNe are small and
less massive (∼10−1 Me). After the envelope ejection, the
remnant core of the star increases in temperature before the
nuclear burning ceases and the star quickly fades, becoming a
white dwarf. The high temperature of the central star (∼25 ×
104 K) causes the previously ejected material to be ionized,
which becomes visible as a PN. There will be ionizing photons
with enough energy to ionize high-excitation species, hence

producing qualitatively different spectra from that of H II
regions.

Eight PNe from our sample were discovered and investigated
for the ﬁrst time (Table 1): #3, #6, #7, #8, #10, #11, #13,
and #14. We spectroscopically conﬁrmed that J013416.39
+304326.5 (#12) is a PN. We present the chemical abundances
of O, He, N, Ne, S, and Ar (where available) obtained with the

Te-sensitive method in six PNe (Figure 3). We do not ﬁnd strong
deviation between the chemical compositions in six PNe and H II
regions. The abundance gradient in PNe was not presented,
because our PNe are located in the narrow range of galacto-
centric distances (0.7  R/R25  1.1).

We have investigated the azimuthal distribution of some
metals. The azimuthal O, N, and S distribution of H II regions

λλ6716, 6731 lines were considered. The error was
calculated as standard deviation, σ(Vr), from these lines. A

sketch of
Humphreys (1980).

4.3. Spiral Structure of M33

H II regions are the sites of recent massive star formation,
and they are good tracers for the galactic spiral structure. Here
we present the grand-design pattern of the spiral structure of
M33 by employing 519 H II regions. We collected 95 H II
regions from this study, 396 nonoverlapping H II regions from
Lin et al. (2017), and 28 nonoverlapping H II regions from
Zhang et al. (2020a). Figure 8 presents the designed pattern of
the spiral structure of M33. The sketches were drawn to follow
the H II regions and trace the multiarm proﬁle of M33. We
identiﬁed 14 spiral arms in M33. Our grand-designed pattern is
close to the one shown in Kam et al. (2015). However, more
arms were noticed in this study compared to Kam et al. (2015).

4.4. NGC 604

and

(#50),

J013433.41+304653.8

NGC 604 is the largest star-forming region in M33 and the
second most massive H II region in the Local Group and is thus
an important laboratory for massive star formation. NGC 604 is
also known as a depository of W-R stars. There are three
objects in NGC 604 in our sample: J013432.29+304659.3
(#46),
J013431.65
+304717.5 (#104). Below we comment on individual objects.
J013432.29 + 304659.3 (#46): The spectrum of this nebula
contains both types of lines: narrow nebular and broad emission
lines C III λ4650 and C IV λ5806 from an ionizing W-R star
(Figure 10). Based on the relative strengths of these carbon lines,
we classiﬁed this as a WC star. Possibly,
this is a newly
discovered WC star. However, we do not rule out that these
carbon features may belong to an already-known WCE star
classiﬁed by Massey & Johnson (1998) and studied in Neugent
& Massey (2011) with its name J013432.32+304659.7, since
the distance between J013432.32+304659.7 and J013432.29
+304659.3 is 2″.

J013433.41 + 304653.8 (#50): This object has no clear
history of spectral classiﬁcation in the literature prior to this
work. We identiﬁed it as an H II region, and its spectrum is
presented in Figure 9. The nebular part of its spectrum is
similar to that of J013432.29+304659.3. Lines such as [O I],
[O II], [O III], [N II], [Ne III], [S II], [S III], [Cl III], [Ar III], He I,
He II, and hydrogen lines were measured. The chemical
composition of this H II region was obtained for the ﬁrst time.
The chemical abundances of all investigated elements in both
#46 and #50 are found to be similar.

J013431.65 + 304717.5 (#104): This object is located close

to H II region LGGS J013431.69+304717.4.

4.5. NGC 595

NGC 595 is a large star-forming region in M33. There are three
objects in NGC 595 in our sample: J013334.27+304136.7 (#17),
J013334.22+304127.6 (#24), and J013335.28+304146.0 (#99).
J013334.27+304136.7 (#17) was identiﬁed before as a W-R star
in Neugent & Massey (2011). Both nebulae J013334.22
+304127.6 (#24) and J013335.28+304146.0 (#99) are inves-
tigated here for the ﬁrst time.

in M33 is shown in Figure 6. The speciﬁc azimuths are the
number of degrees, which increase counterclockwise from due
north. The abundances of presented elements have nearly
uniform azimuthal distribution within the uncertainty (rms
scatter) of 0.02 dex for oxygen (N2 and O3N2 methods), 0.08
dex for nitrogen, and 0.18 dex for sulfur. These results are in
line with previous studies (e.g., Bresolin 2011; Lin et al. 2017).

4.2. Radial Velocities

Radial velocities (Figure 7) were calculated with formula
Rv = c(λ/λ0 − 1)+Va, where c is speed of light, λ are
emission peaks of a line proﬁle, λ0 is laboratory wavelength,
and Va is heliocentric correction. Heliocentric correction
counting the orbital Earth rotation, daily rotation, and secular
and Earth−Moon perturbations was calculated following the

4.6. New Transition W-R WN/C Star in M33?

W-R stars are massive stars at the ﬁnal evolutionary stage
characterized by highly evolved surface elements and high
their spectra
mass-loss rates. Due to strong stellar winds,
showed strong, broad emission lines of nuclear-processed
material (Cassinelli & Hartmann 1975). W-R stars are divided
into two types: WN (nitrogen rich) or WC (carbon rich),
depending on the emission lines in their spectrum. Both types
contain large amounts of helium with little to no hydrogen
(Massey & Olsen 2003; Meynet & Maeder 2005; Meynet et al.
2011). In the spectra of some stars, the strong emission lines of
both carbon and nitrogen can be detected,
leading to an
intermediate WN/C classiﬁcation (Conti & Massey 1989;
Crowther et al. 1995). WN/C stars are indeed considered to be

The broad emission lines C III λ4650 and C IV λ5806 are marked. Plenty of the

Figure 11. Top panel: the blue (3650–5950 Å) part of the spectrum of J013237.67+304005.4 (#110). The broad emission lines C III λ4650 and C IV λ5806 belong to
the WC companion, while N III λλ4634.42 and λλ4511.15 belong to the WN companion. Bottom panel: the red (5950–9200 Å) part of the same star. Narrow

at an intermediate evolutionary phase from the WN to WC
stages. These transition stars are rarely observed in galaxies,
because this transition period must be relatively short.

The stars with WN/C characteristics were discovered as in
M33 (Schild et al. 1990), as well as in other galaxies, e.g., in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (Breysacher et al. 1999; Shenar
et al. 2019; Hung et al. 2021), in the nearby spiral galaxy M81
(Gómez-González et al. 2016, 2020), and in our Galaxy (Zhang
et al. 2020b). Recently, the ﬁrst transition WN/C star was
discovered in M31 (Shara et al. 2016).

Here we present a possible transition W-R WN/C star
J013237.67+304005.4 (#110) in M33. The spectrum of
#110 with line identiﬁcation is presented in Figure 11.
Except for narrow emission lines indicating evidence for
circumstellar nebulae,
there are plenty of broad emission
lines. The broad emission lines C III λ4650 and C IV λ5806
allow us to classify the star as WC, and strong nitrogen lines
such as N IV λ4058 and N III λλ4634.42 and 4511.15 lead to
WN classiﬁcation; however, P Cygni proﬁles in He I λ3889
and He I λ4471 are main characteristics of Ofpe/WN9
“Slash” stars. These stars show properties intermediate
between those of Of and WN stars and are believed to be a
quiescent form of LBV (Massey et al. 1996). Our object has
log EW(He II λ4686) = 1.56 and log EW(C IV λ5808) = 1.80,
which are quite similar to those measured in other transition
stars (Figure 5 in Conti & Massey 1989). According to the
log of EW of C IV λ5808 versus
diagram of
He II λ4686 from Conti & Massey (1989) and templates

the

from Schild et al. (1990) and Massey & Johnson (1998), we
classiﬁed J013237.67+304005.4 (#110) as WN8/C4-5.

To determine whether the carbon and nitrogen features arise
in two stars or in a single object whose composition is
intermediate between that of WN and WC stars, we measured
radial velocities from the most emission lines that can be found
in the spectra (Table 6). Each line was ﬁtted with a Gaussian
function, whose parameters are presented in Table 6. Some
spectra are composite. For example, Hα proﬁles contains two
emission lines (broad and narrow). Their Gaussian ﬁts are in
the top panel of Figure 12. The region 4686 Å is even more
complex, and four Gaussian functions are required to get the
best ﬁt of this region. Although the C III
line has three
components at 4647.42, 4650.25, and 4651.47 Å, we treated it
as one line at 4649.445 Å. We found that both carbon lines C III
λ4649.445 and C IV λ5806 are broader compared to other lines
and the radial velocities are different. Using time domain data
and three spectra of #110, obtained at the local times 23:50
(2018 October 9), 00:23, and 00:56 (2018 October 10), we
found no wavelength shifts within this 1 hr period. However,
the observational period is too short to completely rule out the
binary system. We also cannot rule out that the spectrum of
#110 is
the spectrum of an Ofpe/WN9 “Slash” star,
contaminated with WC features from a WC star, which is not
gravitationally connected with #110.

The biggest sample of 413 star-forming H II regions in M33
was investigated by Lin et al. (2017). They obtained O/H
gradients ﬁtted out to 1.1 R25: −0.17 ± 0.03, −0.19 ± 0.01,
and −0.16 ± 0.17 dex
1, utilizing abundances from O3N2,
N2 diagnostics, and a direct method, respectively. Our results
are in agreement within the error bars with Lin et al. (2017) for
all three methods. Toribio San Cipriano et al. (2016) performed
a deep spectrophotometry of 11 H II regions in M33 and
obtained oxygen gradients of −0.33 ± 0.13 dex
1 (or
−0.045 ± 0.13 dex kpc−1) using the ORLs and −0.36 ± 0.07
1 (or −0.0495 ± 0.07 dex kpc−1) from CELs. Their
dex
gradients are slightly higher in absolute value compared to our
results for oxygen. Magrini et al. (2010) analyzed the spatial
distribution of metals in M33 using a new sample and the
literature data on H II regions and concluded that the metallicity
gradient in the disk of M33 has a slope of −0.27 ± 0.009 dex
1. A similar result was obtained by Bresolin (2011), who

6. Conclusion

The study of the morphological and chemical structures of
M33 can provide a constraint on models of the formation and
evolution of the galaxies. We present the spiral structure and
metallicity structure of M33 employing 110 nebulae in M33
from the LAMOST survey. A total of 63 newly identiﬁed
nebulae (55 H II regions and 8 PNe) are investigated for the ﬁrst
time in this study. By employing commonly used BPT criteria,
110 nebulae in our sample were classiﬁed as 95 H II regions
and 15 PNe. The plasma diagnostics; chemical composition of
O, N, He, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar (where available); and interstellar
reddening were treated using the code NEAT (v.2.2; Wesson
et al. 2012). For 6 PNe and 21 H II
regions, chemical
abundances were obtained with the Te-sensitive method, while
Te = 10,000 K was employed for the remaining objects. We
obtained the following O abundance gradients: −

index. Negative axisymmetric metallicity gradients were
obtained from all presented elements. This result conﬁrms the
existence of the global metallicity distribution that is assumed
in numerous previous studies.

H II regions are good tracers of the sites of recent massive
star formation. We use H II regions to probe the spiral structure
of M33. Our sample of 95 H II regions was combined with 424
nonoverlapping H II
regions known from the literature.
Employing the sample with a total of 519 H II regions, we
identiﬁed 14 spiral arms in M33. The reconstructed spiral
structure of M33 is close to the one shown in Kam et al. (2015)
from the distribution of the ionized gas.

During this study, we have found two spectra with a
combination of the narrow nebulous emission lines and the
broad emission lines that belonged to the mother star. Based on
the spectral analysis, we report on possible discoveries: one WC
star candidate J013432.29+304659.3 (#46) and one transition
W-R WN/C candidate star J013237.67+304005.4 (#110).

All presented tables in this study, as well as measured ﬂuxes,
ﬂuxes corrected for extinction, and ionic abundances in
machine-readable format, are available via private request.
