Abstract

Suppose the ground ﬁeld is algebraically closed and of characteristic diﬀerent from
2. In this paper, we described the intrinsic connections among linear super-commuting
maps, super-biderivations and centroids for Lie superalgebras satisfying certain assump-
tions. This is a generalization of the results of Breˇsar and Zhao on Lie algebras.

super-commuting maps, super-biderivations and centroids for Lie superalgebras satisfying
certain conditions. Most results of commuting maps and biderivations on Lie algebras are
from these papers [11, 15, 14, 4, 9, 13, 8, 2]. The idea of this paper springs from biderivations
and linear commuting maps on the Lie algebras [2]. Breˇsar and Zhao [2] presented two results
for a perfect and centerless Lie algebra L. One is that every skew-symmetric biderivation is
of the form of the centroid of L. The other is that every commuting linear map from L to
L lies in the centroid of L under a strong assumption. The parallel results are obtained for
Lie superalgebras in this paper. Our reason for doing so goes beyond a pure generalization.
Rather, we expect that linear commuting maps on Lie superalgebras will play an important
role in the theory of functional identities on Lie superalgebras. The reason is a fact that the
description of linear commuting maps on Lie algebras can be viewed as a testing case for
developing the theory of functional identities on Lie algebras [2]. The root lies in additive
commuting maps on prime rings [1] which eventually led to the theory of functional identities
on noncommutative rings [3].

An interest in studying super-biderivations and super-commuting maps on superalgebras
has grown more recently [16, 18, 7, 17, 5]. Xia, Wang and Han [16] proved that any super-
skewsymmetric super-biderivation of Super-Virasoro Algebras is inner and obtained the form
of every linear super-commuting map. Yuan and Tang [18] characterized super-biderivations
of classical simple Lie superalgebras over the complex ﬁeld C and proved that all super-
biderivations of classical simple Lie superalgebras are inner super-biderivations. Fan and Dai
[7] proved that all super-biderivations on the centerless super-Virasoro algebras are inner
super-biderivations and studied the linear super-commuting maps on the centerless super-
Virasoro algebras. Yuan, Chen and Cao [17] characterized the super-biderivations of Cartan
type Lie superalgebras over the complex ﬁeld C and proved that all super-biderivations of
Cartan type simple Lie superalgebras are inner super-biderivations. Cheng and Sun [5] proved
that every super-skewsymmetric super-biderivation of the twisted N = 2 superconformal
algebra is inner. The results in these papers [16, 7, 18, 17, 5] hold for certain superalgebras
by using the approach depending on the certain superalgebras, respectively. In this paper,
our results hold for the general Lie superalgebras satisfying certain assumptions. The results
are suitable for simple Lie superalgebras.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 will introduce the deﬁnitions of super-
biderivations, super-commuting maps and centroids for a Lie superalgebra. Section 2 will
be devote to describing the internal connections between super-biderivations and centroids.

Finally, in Section 3, the connections between super-commuting maps and centroids will be
expressed.

2 Deﬁnitions and notions

Suppose L = L¯0 ⊕ L¯1 is a superalgebra over a ﬁeld F. If a linear map f : L −→ L such that

f (Li) ⊆ Li+τ , ∀ i ∈ Z2,

then f is a homogeneous linear map of degree τ , that is |f | = τ , where τ ∈ Z2. If τ = ¯0,
then f is called an even linear map. For a linear map f , if |f | occurs, then f implies a
homogeneous map. For a Lie superalgebra L = L¯0 ⊕ L¯1, if |x| occurs, then x implies a
homogeneous element in L. A linear map D : L −→ L is a superderivation of L [10, 12], if

D([x, y]) = [D(x), y] + (−1)|D||x|[x, D(y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L.

Denote by Derτ (L) the set of all superderivations of degree τ for L. Obviously, Der(L) =
Der¯0(L) ⊕ Der¯1(L). For a Lie superalgebra L = L¯0 ⊕ L¯1, if a bilinear map

δ : L × L −→ L

satisfying that

δ(Li, Lj) ⊆ Li+j+τ , ∀ i, j ∈ Z2,
then δ is a homogeneous bilinear map of degree τ , that is |δ| = τ , where τ ∈ Z2. A bilinear
map δ : L × L −→ L is a super-biderivaton of L [2], if

δ(x, y) = −(−1)|x||y|δ(y, x),
δ([x, y], z) = (−1)|δ||x|[x, δ(y, z)] + (−1)|y||z|[δ(x, z), y], ∀ x, y, z ∈ L.

Denote by BDerτ (L) the set of all super-biderivations of degree τ for L. Obviously,

BDer(L) = BDer¯0(L) ⊕ BDer¯1(L).

Deﬁnition 2.1. For a Lie superalgebra L = L¯0 ⊕ L¯1, an even linear map f : L −→ L is
called a linear super-commuting map if

[f (x), y] = [x, f (y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L.

3 Super-biderivations

Lemma 3.1. Let L be a Lie superalgebra and f : L −→ L be a linear super-commuting map.
Suppose

δ(x, y) = [x, f (y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L.

Then δ : L × L −→ L is a super-biderivation.

Proof. By

it follows that |δ| = |f | = ¯0. For one thing, we have

δ(x, y) = [x, f (y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L,

−(−1)|x||y|δ(y, x) = −(−1)|x||y|[y, f (x)]

= (−1)|x||y|+|y|(|f |+|x|)[f (x), y]

= [f (x), y]

= [x, f (y)]

= δ(x, y).

For the other, we get

δ([x, y], z) = [[x, y], f (z)]

= [x, [y, f (z)]] − (−1)|x||y|[y, [x, f (z)]]
= [x, δ(y, z)] − (−1)|x||y|[y, δ(x, z)]
= [x, δ(y, z)] + (−1)|x||y|+|y|(|δ|+|x|+|z|)[δ(x, z), y]
= (−1)|δ||x|[x, δ(y, z)] + (−1)|y||z|[δ(x, z), y].

Combining (1) with (2), then δ is a super-biderivation.

Deﬁnition 3.2. [6] Let L be a Lie superalgebra and γ : L −→ L a linear map. Then

Γ(L) = {γ : L → L | γ([x, y]) = (−1)|γ||x|[x, γ(y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L}

is called the centroid of L. Denote Γτ (L) by the set of all elements of degree τ in Γ(L).
Obviously,

Γ(L) = Γ¯0(L) ⊕ Γ¯1(L).

Lemma 3.3. Let L be a Lie superalgebra. Suppose that γ : L −→ L is a linear map and
δ : L × L −→ L a bilinear map. Let δ(x, y) = γ([x, y]). If γ ∈ Γ(L), then δ is a super-
biderivation.

Proof. By the deﬁnition 3.2, it follows that

δ(x, y) = γ([x, y]) = (−1)|γ||x|[x, γ(y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L.

Then |δ| = |γ|. First, we have

−(−1)|x||y|δ(y, x) = −(−1)|x||y|γ([y, x])

= −(−1)|x||y|γ(−(−1)|x||y|[x, y])

= δ(x, y), ∀ x, y ∈ L.

Second, by super-Jacobi identity we have

δ([x, y], z) = γ([[x, y], z])

= γ([x, [y, z]] − (−1)|x||y|[y, [x, z]])
= γ([x, [y, z]]) − (−1)|x||y|γ([y, [x, z]])
= (−1)|x||γ|[x, γ([y, z])] − (−1)|x||y|+|γ||y|[y, γ([x, z])]
= (−1)|x||γ|[x, γ([y, z])] + (−1)|x||y|+|γ||y|+|y|(|γ|+|x|+|z|)[γ([x, z]), y]
= (−1)|x||γ|[x, γ([y, z])] + (−1)|y||z|[γ([x, z]), y]
= (−1)|x||δ|[x, δ(y, z)] + (−1)|y||z|[δ(x, z), y], ∀ x, y, z ∈ L.

Then δ is a super-biderivation.

Deﬁnition 3.4. Suppose S is a non-empty subset of Lie superalgebra L. Let

ZL(S) = {v ∈ L | [S, v] = 0}.

If S = L, then Z(L) = ZL(L) is the center of L. If ZL(L) = {0}, then L is centerless. Denote
L′ = [L, L] by the derived algebra of L. If L = L′, then ZL(L′) = ZL′(L′) is the center of L′.

Lemma 3.5. [7] Suppose L is a Lie superalgebra and δ : L × L −→ L is a super-biderivation
of L. Then

[δ(x, y), [u, v]] = (−1)|δ|(|x|+|y|)[[x, y], δ(u, v)], ∀ x, y, u, v ∈ L.

6

Lemma 3.6. Suppose L is a Lie superalgebra and δ : L × L −→ L is a super-biderivation.
Then

δ(u, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)] ∈ ZL(L′), ∀ u, x, y ∈ L.

Proof. By Lemma 3.5, we have

(3.1)

[δ(z, w), [x, y]] = (−1)|δ|(|z|+|w|)[[z, w], δ(x, y)].

On the one hand, replacing x by [x, u], then

(3.2)

[δ(z, w), [[x, u], y]] = (−1)|δ|(|z|+|w|)[[z, w], δ([x, u], y)].

On the other hand, by super-Jacobi identity we have

(3.3)

[δ(z, w), [[x, u], y]] = [δ(z, w), [x, [u, y]]] − (−1)|x||u|[δ(z, w), [u, [x, y]]].

Therefore, by (3.2),

(3.4)

[δ(z, w), [[x, u], y]]

= (−1)|δ|(|z|+|w|)[[z, w], δ(x, [u, y])] − (−1)|x||u|+|δ|(|z|+|w|)[[z, w], δ(u, [x, y])].

Comparing (3.3) and (3.4) we have

(3.5)

(−1)|δ|(|z|+|w|)[[z, w], (δ([x, u], y)] − δ(x, [u, y]) + (−1)|x||u|δ(u, [x, y])) = 0.

Because δ is a super-biderivation, by (3.5) we get

2(−1)|δ|(|z|+|w|)+|x||u|[[z, w], ([δ(u, x), y] + (−1)|δ||x|[x, δ(u, y)] − (−1)|δ||x|+|x||u|[u, δ(x, y)])] = 0.

According to

it follows that

[δ(u, x), y] + (−1)|δ||x|[x, δ(u, y)] = δ(u, [x, y]),

(−1)|δ||x|+|x||u|δ(u, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)] ∈ ZL(L′), ∀ u, x, y ∈ L.

Lemma 3.7. Suppose L is a Lie superalgebra with L = L′ and δ : L × L −→ L is a
super-biderivation. Then

(3.6)

δ(u, [x, y]) = (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)], ∀ u, x, y ∈ L.

Proof. We have

δ([u, v], [x, y]) − (−1)|δ|(|u|+|v|)[[u, v], δ(x, y)]

= (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(v, [x, y])] + (−1)|v|(|x|+|y|)[δ(u, [x, y]), v]

−(−1)|δ|(|u|+|v|)[u, [v, δ(x, y)]] + (−1)|δ|(|u|+|v|)+|u||v|[v, [u, δ(x, y)]]

= (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(v, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||v|[v, δ(x, y)]]

−(−1)|v|(|x|+|y|)+|v|(|δ|+|u|+|x|+|y|)[v, δ(u, [x, y])] + (−1)|δ|(|u|+|v|)+|u||v|[v, [u, δ(x, y)]]

= (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(v, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||v|[v, δ(x, y)]]

−(−1)|v|(|δ|+|u|)[v, δ(u, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)]], ∀ u, v, x, y ∈ L.

By Lemma 3.6 and L = L′ we have

δ(u, [x, y]) = (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)], ∀ u, x, y ∈ L.

Theorem 3.8. Suppose that L is a centerless Lie superalgebra with L = L′. Then every
superderivation δ : L × L −→ L can be written as

δ(x, y) = γ([x, y]),

where γ is in the centroid of L.

Proof. Suppose γ : L −→ L is a linear map given by

(3.7)

γ([x, y]) = δ(x, y), ∀ x, y ∈ L.

By Lemma 3.7, γ is well deﬁned. In fact, suppose Σi[xi, yi] = 0, we have

0 = δ(u, Σi[xi, yi]) = Σiδ(u, [xi, yi]) = (−1)|u||δ|[u, (Σiδ(xi, yi))].

By ZL(L) = {0}, we have Σiδ(xi, yi) = 0. By (3.6), we have

δ(u, v) = (−1)|δ||u|[u, γ(v)], ∀ u, v ∈ L.

By (3.7), we get

γ([x, y]) = (−1)|δ||u|[x, γ(y)], ∀ x, y ∈ L.

Then it suggests that γ ∈ Γ(L).

Deﬁnition 3.9. Suppose that δ is a skew-symmetric bilinear map with δ(L, L′) = 0. Then
δ is a super-biderivation, called a trivial super-biderivation of L.

Remark 3.10. Suppose δ : L × L −→ L is an arbitrary super-biderivation of L. Then we
have

0 = δ([z, x], y)

= (−1)|δ||z|[z, δ(x, y)] + (−1)|x||y|[δ(z, y), x]
= (−1)|δ||z|[δ(z, y), x], ∀ x, y ∈ L, z ∈ Z(L),

that is, [δ(z, y), x] = 0. So δ(Z, L) ⊂ Z(L). Furthermore, let ¯L = L/Z(L) and

¯δ(¯x, ¯y) = δ(x, y), ∀ x, y ∈ L.

Then ¯δ : ¯L × ¯L −→ ¯L is a super-biderivation, where ¯x = x + Z(L) ∈ ¯L, ∀ x ∈ L.

Theorem 3.11. Suppose L is a Lie superalgebra. Up to isomorphism, the map δ −→ ¯δ is
one-to-one correspondence from a trivial superderivation δ of L to a trivial superderivation
¯δ of ¯L.

Proof. Obviously, it is surjective. It remains to show that the map is injective. Suppose δ1
and δ2 are superderivations of L satisfying ¯δ1 = ¯δ2. Let δ = δ1 − δ2. Then

By virtue of

we have

Thus,

¯δ1(¯x, ¯y) = ¯δ2(¯x, ¯y), ∀ ¯x, ¯y ∈ ¯L.

¯δ1(¯x, ¯y) = δ1(x, y) and δ2(¯x, ¯y) = δ2(x, y),

δ1(x, y) = δ2(x, y).

δ(x, y) = δ1(x, y) − δ2(x, y) ∈ Z(L).

Then δ is a trivial super-biderivation.

Deﬁnition 3.12. Suppose L is a Lie superalgebra. If δ : L × L −→ ZL(L′) is a super-
biderivation of L satisfying δ(L′, L′) = 0, then δ is called a special super-biderivation of
L.

Remark 3.13. Suppose L is a Lie superalgebra and δ : L × L −→ L is a super-biderivation
satisfying

δ(u, [x, y])) = [δ(u, x), y] + (−1)(|δ|+|u|)|x|[x, δ(u, y)], ∀ x, y, u ∈ L.

(3.8)

Let

Then δ′ is a super-biderivation of L′.

δ′ := δ|L′ : L′ × L′ −→ L′.

Theorem 3.14. Let L be a centerless Lie superalgebra. Then

(1) Up to isomorphism, every special superbidevition of L is the unique extention of a

special super-biderivation of L′.

(2) If L is a Lie superalgebra with L = L′, then any special super-biderivation of L is

zero.

Proof. (1) Suppose δ1 and δ2 are super-biderivations of L satisfying δ′
Then δ(L′, L′) = 0. Substitute u, y ∈ L′ into (3.8). We have

1 = δ′

2. Let δ = δ1 − δ2.

[δ(u, x), y] = 0, ∀x ∈ L, y, u ∈ L′,

that is δ(L, L′) ⊂ ZL(L′). By Lemma 3.7, one can get [L, δ(L, L)] ⊂ ZL(L′).

By (3.1), we have

0 = [[L, L], δ(L, L′)] = [δ(L, L), [L, L′]].

Then, for any x, y, z, u, v ∈ L, it suggests that

0 = [[[x, y], z], δ(u, v)]

= [[x, y], [z, δ(u, v)]] − (−1)(|x|+|y|)|z|[z, [[x, y], δ(u, v)]]
= (−1)(|x|+|y|)|z|+|z|(|x|+|y|+|δ|+|u|+|v|)[[[x, y], δ(u, v)], z]
= (−1)|z|(|δ|+|u|+|v|)[[[x, y], δ(u, v)], z].

Since L is centerless, one gets δ(L, L) ⊂ ZL(L′). Then δ is a special super-biderivation of L.
(2) Suppose δ is a special super-biderivation of L. By (1) we have δ(L, L′) ⊂ ZL(L′). Since

L is a centerless Lie superalgebra and L = L′. Then δ(L, L′) = 0.

Suppose δ 6= 0. Then there exist x1 and x2 ∈ L satisfying δ(x1, x2) = z12 6= 0. Since
L is centerless. Picking 0 6= x3 ∈ L such that [x3, z12] = z 6= 0. Let δ(xi, xj) = zij, where
i, j = 1, 2, 3. For one thing, we have

0 = δ([x1, x3], x2)

= (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, δ(x3, x2)] + (−1)|x2||x3|[δ(x1, x2), x3]
= (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, z32] + (−1)|x2||x3|[z12, x3]
= (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, z32] − (−1)|x2||x3|+(|δ|+|x1|+|x2|)|x3|[x3, z12]
= (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, z32] − (−1)|x1||x3|+|δ||x3|z.

For the other, we have

0 = δ([x1, x2], x3)

= (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, δ(x2, x3)] + (−1)|x2||x3|[δ(x1, x3), x2]
= (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, z23] + (−1)|x2||x3|[z13, x2].

For another, we have

0 = δ([x2, x3], x1)

= (−1)|δ||x2|[x2, δ(x3, x1)] + (−1)|x1||x3|[δ(x2, x1), x3]
= (−1)|δ||x2|[x2, z31] + (−1)|x1||x3|[z21, x3]
= (−1)|δ||x2|[x2, z31] − (−1)|x1||x3|+|x1||x2|[z12, x3]
= (−1)|δ||x2|[x2, z31] + (−1)|x1||x3|+|x1||x2|+(|δ|+|x1|+|x2|)|x3|[x3, z12]
= (−1)|δ||x2|[x2, z31] + (−1)|x1||x3|+|x1||x2|+|δ||x3|+|δ||x3|z.

Therefore, it follows at once

(−1)|x1||x3|+|δ||x3|z = (−1)|δ||x1|[x1, z32]

= −(−1)|δ||x1|+|x2||x3|[x1, z23] = [z13, x2]
= −(−1)|x1||x3|[z31, x2]
= (−1)|x1||x3|+(|δ|+|x1|+|x3|)|x2|[x2, z31]
= (−1)|δ||x2|+|x1||x2|+|x2||x3|+|x1||x3|++|x1||x2|+|x2||x3|+|δ||x3|+|δ||x2|z
= −(−1)|x1||x3|+|δ||x3|z.

Then we have z = −z, which contradicts to z 6= 0, thus δ = 0.

4 Linear super-commuting maps

Lemma 4.1. Let L be a Lie superalgebra. Suppose f : L −→ L is a linear super-commuting
map. Then

(cid:2)[w, z], [u, f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)]](cid:3) = 0, ∀ x, y, u, w, z ∈ L.

Proof. Since f is a super-commuting linear map. Then we have

Let

By Lemma 3.3 then

[f (x), y] = [x, f (y)].

δ : L × L −→ L.

δ(x, y) = [x, f (y)]

is a super-biderivation. By Lemme 3.6, we have |δ| = |f | = ¯0 and

(cid:2)[w, z], δ(u, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)](cid:3) = 0, ∀ x, y, u, w, z ∈ L.

Since

and

(−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)] = (−1)|δ||u|[u, [x, f (y)]] = (−1)|f ||u|[u, [x, f (y)]] = [u, [x, f (y)]]

δ(u, [x, y]) = (−1)|f ||u|[u, f ([x, y])] = [u, f ([x, y])], ∀ x, y, u, w, z ∈ L.

Then one can get

0 = [[w, z], δ(u, [x, y]) − (−1)|δ||u|[u, δ(x, y)]]

= [[w, z], [u, f ([x, y])] − [u, [x, f (y)]]]

= [[w, z], [u, f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)]]].

Therefore, it follows that

[[w, z], [u, f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)]]] = 0.

Theorem 4.2. Let L be a Lie superalgebra with L = L′ and ZL(L′) = {0}. If f : L −→ L is
a linear super-commuting map, then f ∈ Γ¯0(L).

Proof. By Lemme 4.1, we have

[[w, z], [u, f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)]]] = 0, ∀ x, y, z, u, w ∈ L.

then

[u, f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)]] ∈ ZL(L′).

Since ZL(L′) = {0}. It follows that

[u, f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)]] = 0.

Furthermore, we get

f ([x, y]) − [x, f (y)] ∈ ZL(L) = ZL(L′) = {0}.

that is,

Thus f ∈ Γ¯0(L).
