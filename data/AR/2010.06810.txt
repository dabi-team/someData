Neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering (νAel) provides a unique laboratory to study the quantum-
mechanical (QM) coherency eﬀects in electroweak interactions. The deviations of the cross-sections
from those of completely coherent systems can be quantitatively characterized through a coherency
parameter α(q2). The relations between α and the underlying nuclear physics in terms of nuclear
form factors are derived. The dependence of cross-section on α(q2) for the various neutrino sources
is presented. The α(q2)-values are evaluated from the measured data of the COHERENT CsI and
Ar experiments. Complete coherency and decoherency conditions are excluded by the CsI data with
p=0.004 at q2=3.1×103 MeV2 and with p=0.016 at q2=2.3×103 MeV2, respectively, verifying that
both QM superpositions and nuclear many-body eﬀects contribute to νAel interactions.

INTRODUCTION

The elastic scattering of a neutrino with a nucleus [1, 2]

νAel :

ν + A(Z, N ) → ν + A(Z, N ) ,

(1)

where A(Z, N ) denotes the atomic nucleus with its re-
spective atomic, charge and neutron numbers, is a fun-
damental electroweak neutral current process in the Stan-
dard Model (SM).

Studies of neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering can pro-
vide sensitive probes to physics beyond SM (BSM) [3, 4]
and certain astrophysical processes [1, 5].
It oﬀers
prospects to study quantum-mechanical (QM) coherency
eﬀects in electroweak interactions [6], neutron density
distributions [7], to detect supernova neutrinos [8] and
to provide a compact and transportable neutrino detec-
tors for real-time monitoring of nuclear reactors [9]. The
νAel events from solar and atmospheric neutrinos are the
irreducible “neutrino ﬂoor” background [10] to the com-
ing generations of dark matter experiments [11].

There are several active experimental programs to ob-
serve and measure the νAel processes with neutrinos from
reactors [12] or from decay-at-rest pions (DAR-π) [4] pro-
vided by spallation neutron source [13]. Future dark mat-
ter experiments may also be sensitive to νAel from solar
neutrinos [14]. First positive measurement of νAel was

achieved by the COHERENT experiment with CsI(Na)
detector [15], followed by measurements with liquid Ar
detector [16].

The νAel interaction provides a laboratory to probe
the QM coherency eﬀects [6]. Experimental measure-
ments are mostly performed in a parameter space where
the coherency eﬀects are partial and incomplete. The
deviations from perfect coherency would have to be de-
scribed and quantiﬁed before this interaction can be ef-
fectively applied towards other goals like the studies of
BSM physics.

Coherency in QM superpositions among scattering am-
plitudes from individual nucleons is central to νAel in-
teractions. Our earlier work [6] identiﬁed a coherency
parameter α(q2) which can quantify and consistently
characterize the degree of coherency in νAel with dif-
ferent ν-sources and target nuclei. This article follows
and expands on these studies. The relations between
α(q2) with the complementary descriptions in terms of
nuclear physics via the language of nuclear form factors
or with the reduction in cross-sections are discussed in
Section II. The dependence of coherency eﬀects with in-
teraction kinematics for various neutrino sources and de-
tector targets are surveyed in Section III. The constraints
provided by the COHERENT-CsI and -Ar data are de-
rived in Section IV.

CHARACTERIZATION

The νAel diﬀerential cross-section at three-momentum
transfer q (≡ |(cid:126)q|) and neutrino energy Eν can be ex-
pressed as [2, 6]:

where Γ(q2) is a function describing the contributions due
to many-body physics in the target nuclei, since the νAel
interactions involve collective contributions of individual
nucleons in the nucleus.

The relevant kinematics variable is q2 which charac-
terizes the physics and is universal to all target. The
experimental observable is the nuclear recoil energy (T ),
expressed in units of keVnr in this article, which de-
pends on the target nuclear mass M and is related
to q2 via q2=2M T +T 2(cid:39)2M T . The minimal observ-
able energy Tmin for the nuclear recoils is the detec-
tor threshold, while kinematics limits the maximum

to T are discussed in Appendix A.

2/(M +2Eν)(cid:39)2Eν

Depending on the particular physics aspects to probe,
there are complementary formulations on the Γ(q2) func-
tion. The conventional description is based on nuclear
physics, expressed as

Γ(q2) ≡ ΓN P (q2) = (cid:2)εZFZ(q2) − N FN (q2)(cid:3)2

,

(3)

where FZ(q2)∈[0, 1] and FN (q2)∈[0, 1] are, respectively,
the proton and neutron nuclear form factors for the nu-
cleus A(Z, N ), while ε≡(1−4 sin2θW)=0.045, indicating
the dominant contributions are from the neutrons.

The merit of this description is to connect νAel to nu-
clear physics so that its studies may beneﬁt from or con-
tribute to the wealth of information and data. Electron-
nucleus scattering experiments provide important data to
the nuclear proton form factor FZ(q2) [17]. The neutron
counterpart FN (q2), however, would require weak pro-
cesses to probe. Studies of νAel have therefore triggered
intense activities towards their measurements [7], com-
plementing experiments with parity-violation scattering
using polarized electrons [18].

In the kinematics regime relevant to this work −
q2R2(cid:28)π2 (natural units with (cid:126)=c=1 are used through-
out), where R=1.2A1/3 fm is the typical scale charac-
terizing the radius of nuclei − nucleons can be taken
as structureless point-like particles, such that their in-
ternal dynamics and QCD eﬀects can be neglected. At
q2→0, there is a perfect alignment of the scattering
amplitude vectors of individual nucleons in the target
nucleus [6]. The interactions are completely coherent.
As q2 increases, deviation from this complete coherency

condition leads to reduction in the cross-section. The
degree of coherency can be quantiﬁed by a parameter
α(q2)≡cosφ∈[0, 1] where φ(q2)∈[0, π/2] is the misalign-
ment phase angle between the scattering amplitudes of
two non-identical nucleons [6]. This leads to a formula-
tion in terms of QM superpositions among the various
scattering centers, in which:

tally measured α(q2)-values from diﬀerent isotope targets
can be directly compared to reveal their varying degrees
of coherency in the respective processes.

An alternative measurement-driven description, de-
noted by ξ(q2), is the cross-section reduction relative to
that of complete coherency condition [6], where
Γ(q2) ≡ ΓDAT A(q2) = (εZ − N )2 · ξ(q2) .

(5)

The functions ΓN P , ΓQM and ΓDAT A are complementary
descriptions of the νAel interactions. The experimentally
measurable cross-section reduction fraction (ξ in ΓDAT A)
is related to QM coherency (α in ΓQM) and nuclear form
factors via, respectively,

representative nuclei are shown in Figures 1a&b, re-
spectively. Contours of maximum-q2 for diﬀerent neu-
trino sources are marked in Figure 1b. The behavior

of ΓN P , α and ξ at the limiting domains corresponding
to the complete coherency and decoherency conditions
are summarized in Table I. In particular, the relation
ΓN P =(ε2Z + N ) for completely decoherent νAel interac-
tions is a result that emerges by relating ΓN P and ΓQM
in Eq. 8, and could not be derived by considerations of
nuclear form factor of Eq. 3 alone.

III. PROJECTED EXPERIMENTAL RANGES

The functions ΓN P , ΓQM and ΓDAT A can be directly mea-
sured from νAel data without input from the underlying
physics. Prior to actual measurements, speciﬁc formu-
lations of the nuclear form factors have to be adopted
for phenomenological studies and to establish the typical
ranges to guide the choices of experimental parameters.
To serve these purposes, the frequently adopted approach
is to take the nuclear form factors for protons and neu-
trons are identical: FN (q2)=FZ(q2)≡FA(q2), and to use
the eﬀective “Helm Form Factor” description of Ref. [20]:

FA(q2) =

form factor is equivalent to the cross-section reduction
fraction: [FA(q2)]2=ξ(q2).

trino sources, with three selected nuclei (Ar;Ge;Xe) are
depicted in Figure 3. The q2-dependence is universal for
the diﬀerent neutrino sources, though their q2
max-values
are distinct due to their varying maximum Eν. These
spectra end-points for reactor, solar and DAR-π neutri-
nos are well-deﬁned, and their corresponding ranges in α
and q2 are depicted in Figures 1b&3, respectively.

A summary plot on the variations of (cid:104)α(cid:105) with the neu-
trino sources and target nuclei is illustrated in Figure 4,
in which the ranges in Eν are deﬁned by the Full-Width-
Half-Maximum (FWHM) of [Φν·σνAel]. For complete-
ness, the diﬀerential and integral event rates due to the
four neutrino sources in measurable nuclear recoil energy
T , together with their corresponding α and (cid:104)α(cid:105) values,
are discussed and presented in Appendix A.

It can be seen that coherency is mostly complete
(α>95%) for νAel with reactor and solar neutrinos,
whereas coherency is only partial for DAR-π and weak
for atmospheric neutrinos. Accordingly, studies of νAel
with diﬀerent neutrino sources provide complementary
information and cover the transitions from completely
coherent to decoherent states.

IV. MEASUREMENTS FROM CURRENT DATA

The COHERENT-CsI(Na) and -Ar experiments at the
DAR-π beam with the Spallation Neutron Source facil-
ity at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory have provided
positive measurements on νAel.

While the ﬁrst-generation ‘discovery” measurements
cannot be expected to provide severe constraints on
α(q2), it is instructive to go through the data analysis
to establish the ranges of the eﬀects and to check consis-
tency.

The published event rates and statistical uncertainties
from the COHERENT CsI(Na) [15] and Ar [16] data were
adopted as input in this analysis. What were measured
per event are the numbers of photo-electrons. To con-
vert these to nuclear recoil energy for physics interpreta-
tion, the knowledge of quenching factor (QF) is necessary.
The Ar results of Ref. [16] has QF incorporated already.
The uncertainties of the QF-model used to derive the
ﬁrst results of CsI(Na) in Ref. [15] were at ∼25%. For
this analysis, a subsequent improved QF-measurement
by the same Collaboration [22] were adopted, in which
an accuracy of ∼3.6% was stated. We note that a previ-
ous independent QF-measurement [23] provided results
consistent with this one at a ∼14% level.

Folding in published signal eﬃciencies, the eﬃciency-
corrected event rates in diﬀerent q2-bins were derived
and are depicted in Figures 5a&b for CsI and Ar, re-
spectively. These were compared with the complete co-
herency conditions in which α=1(φ=0) and equivalently
Γ(q2)=((cid:15)Z−N )2 is set in Eq 2. Expected spectra for the
completely decoherent cases are also displayed.

The systematic uncertainties of this analysis were
taken from the published estimates discarding the com-

These are represented by the width of the complete co-

are correlated in q2 in general. In practice, statistical ac-
curacies dominate the uncertainties at the current level
of sensitivities, as shown by comparing the theory band
width with the data error bars in Figures 5a&b. Accord-
ingly, the systematic errors are assumed to be uncorre-
lated in q2. They are combined bin-wise in quadrature
with the statistical errors to produce the total uncertain-
ties. Under this error estimation scheme, the systematic

the speciﬁc cases of α=1(0), equivalently φ=0(π/2), with

In particular,
the most stringent bounds within the stated region-of-
interest in Ref. [15] in excluding complete QM coherency
and decoherency at 90% conﬁdence levels with speciﬁed
p-values are, respectively,

α < 0.57
φ < 0.61 · (π/2)

φ > 0.80 · (π/2)

(12)

at q2=2.3×103 MeV2. These results verify that both
QM superpositions among the nucleonic scattering cen-
ters and nuclear many-body eﬀects contribute to the νAel
process.

These diverse ranges of α-sensitivity indicate the
complementarity of νAel measurements among reactor
and DAR-π neutrinos. Future measurements of solar
νAel [14] with multi-ton detectors would probe a similar
range of α as reactor neutrinos. Xenon detectors with
scale O(100)ton would be required to probe the weakly-
coherent region at α<0.2 with atmospheric neutrinos.

V. SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS

Neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering − the interaction
νAel in Eq. 1 − involves two distinct concepts: elastic
kinematics and QM-coherency. It provides a laboratory
to study QM-superpositions in electroweak interactions.
The QM-coherency aspect should be characterized by
distributions with dependence on A(Z, N ) and q2. De-
scriptions of coherency as a binary state or having both
concepts bundled together may have the unintended con-
sequences of missing the complexities of the process and
suppressing the potential richness of its physics content.
We formulated a quantitative and universal parametriza-
tion of the QM-coherency [6] to facilitate studies of QM-
eﬀects in νAel, under which the fundamental parameter is
the experimentally accessible misalignment phase-angle

corresponds to the stated region-of-interest in Ref. [15] where
physics analysis was performed.

eﬀects contribute to <4% and <1.5% of the total uncer-
tainties over all q2-bins for CsI and Ar, respectively.

The cross-section reduction fractions ξ(q2) were evalu-
ated, from which α(q2) and their uncertainties were ex-
tracted using Eq. 6. The various measures which charac-
terize allowed and excluded intervals at each q2-bin were
then derived with the standard statistics procedures [24],
assuming Gaussian errors.

The allowed 1-σ ranges in α(q2) are depicted as stripe-
shaded regions in Figures 6a&b for CsI and Ar, respec-
tively. These results are data-driven without invoking
nuclear physics input. Measurements and implications
of every q2-bin are independent of and uncorrelated with
the others, and therefore the allowed intervals in adjacent
bins are discontinuous.

The diﬀerent q2-bins become correlated when the nu-
clear form factors of Eq. 9 are adopted and imposed as
theoretical expectations. The predicted parameter space
from measurements with projected 10% uncertainty at
±1σ-level is superimposed as dark-shaded bands, show-
ing the cases with CsI (equivalently, Xe) and Ar at
DAR-π. The projected sensitivity for reactor-ν on Ge is
displayed in Figure 6c, showing that measurements with
reactor νAel can probe the complete coherency regime. A
bin-wise 10% uncertainty corresponds to an appropriate
sensitivity target for future experiments. It is the scale
where systematic eﬀects start to contribute, and the mea-
surements can make strong tests on the extreme cases of
α=0(1) as well as making comparisons with nuclear form
factor predictions.

It can be seen that the current data are consistent with
the predictions from Eq. 9. Future measurements with
suﬃcient accuracies would probe the transitions in QM

(φ, equivalently as α≡cosφ) between non-identical nucle-
onic scattering centers.

Current positive measurements on νAel provide only
weak constraints to α(q2) and equivalently misalignment
phase-angle φ(q2). Data with O(10%) accuracy would
allow the studies of transitions in QM-coherency over a
wide range in α∈[0, 1].

The νAel process described in terms of QM-eﬀects
(ΓQM) is complementary to the conventional descriptions
with nuclear form factors (ΓN P ) based on the many-body
physics in the nucleon-nucleus interplay. Both formu-
lations are related with the directly measurable cross-
section reduction fraction (ξ), and among themselves, via
Eqs. 6,7&8.

The α-parameter quantiﬁes QM-coherency in νAel and
adds preciseness to the qualitative discussions. While
the derivation of the α-values depends on A(Z, N ) and
q2 in similar footing as those for ΓN P , the interpreta-
tion of measurements with α in terms of degrees of QM-
coherency or scattering phase-angle alignment is univer-
sal among diﬀerent conﬁgurations with varying nuclei
and q2. This feature allows the quantitative character-
ization of the conﬁgurations and is not available with
the ξ or ΓN P frameworks. Referring to an example illus-
trated in Figure 1a, the four cases C0,1,2,3 are all within
the DAR-π measurable kinematics domain.
It can be
inferred that Conﬁguration-C0 with Ar has the same
QM-coherency as C2 in CsI (α0=α2) while having lower
and higher levels of coherency than C1 (α0<α1) and C3
(α0>α3), respectively, despite the nuclear targets and
interaction kinematics (q2 and T ) are diﬀerent and the

cross-section reduction ξ0>ξ1,2,3 apply in all cases.

New measurements on νAel from a variety of neutrino
sources and nuclear targets can be expected. To facilitate
comprehensive book-keeping of the expanding array of
data from diverse conﬁgurations, it would be beneﬁcial to
include the α-parameter as a qualiﬁer on QM-coherency
to each measurement, in the similar spirit as adopting q2
to qualify the interaction kinematics.

The quantitative description of QM-superpositions
with the α-parameter among the scattering amplitudes
between individual nucleons may serve as natural entry-
points to some BSM studies, such as those where both
coherent and decoherent channels would contribute to
νAel [25]. The experimentally measurable relation be-
tween ΓN P and α in Figure 1b describes the transitions
in QM-coherency in terms of the evolution from nuclear
to nucleon eﬀects in νAel
interaction. Understanding
and applications of these are possible topics of future
research, but are beyond the scope of the present work.

Integration over T ∈[Tmin, Tmax] gives the total event
rates.

The universality of Figure 3 no longer applies when q2
is replaced by T . The variations of α, FA and ξ with T de-
pend on Eν-distributions and therefore neutrino sources.
The variations are depicted in Figure 8.

The diﬀerential rates derived from the four sources and
three targets are displayed in Figure 9. The correspond-
ing total rates are shown in Figure 10, showing their vari-
ations with Tmin and (cid:104)α(cid:105). The values of (cid:104)α(cid:105) and (cid:104)ξ(cid:105) as
well as the total event rates at Tmin=1(10) keVnr for
the various neutrino sources and target nuclei are sum-
marized in Table II. Evaluation of these rates are based
on standard solar and atmospheric spectra [21]. Reactor
¯νe ﬂux is taken to be 1013 cm-2s-1, while DAR-π per-
ﬂavor neutrino ﬂux is 3.4×1014 cm-2yr-1 corresponding
to 2×1023 proton-on-target(POT)/year at 19.3 m from
target [15]. There is no high-energy cut-oﬀ in Eν for the
atmospheric neutrino spectra. The diﬀerential and inte-
gral spectra of Figures 9&10d are therefore evaluated for
α∈[0.01, 1.0], corresponding to T <(361;148;60) keVnr for
(Ar;Ge;Xe).

Typically, measurements of νAel with reactor and so-
lar neutrinos require O(1)keVnr detector threshold giving
expected rates of O(1)/kg-day and O(1)/ton-yr, respec-

mospheric neutrinos are O(10)/kg-yr and O(0.01)/ton-yr
at a threshold of O(10)keVnr, respectively.

At the detection threshold of 1 keVnr, 90% of
the elastic scattering events between Weakly Interact-
ing Massive Particles (WIMPs)-dark matter of mass
1 TeV with (Ar;Ge;Xe)-target have recoil energy up to

(99;74;35) keVnr. These kinematics ranges correspond
to α as low as (0.49;0.22;0.14) for νAel scattering with
atmospheric neutrinos, as indicated in Figure 8d − far
from the complete coherency regime. Accordingly, the
description of “the neutrino ﬂoor originates from coherent
neutrino-nucleus scattering” is not applicable for WIMPs
at TeV or higher mass scales.
