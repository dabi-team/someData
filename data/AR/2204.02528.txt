Abstract

Let R be a commutative ring with unity 1 ∈ R. In this article, we introduce the concept
of prime principal right ideal rings (PPRIR), A prime ideal P of R is said to be prime
principal right ideal (PPRI) is given by P = {ar : r ∈ R} for some element a. The
ring R is said to be prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) if every prime ideal of R
is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI). A prime principal right ideal ring R is called a
prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID) if R is a domain. Several properties and
characteristics of prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR).

1. Introduction

Throughout this article, all rings are commutative ring with nonzero unity 1. An ideal
P of the ring R is said to be prime ideal if for all x, y ∈ R with xy ∈ P then x ∈ P or
y ∈ P . Since prime ideals are so signiﬁcant in commutative rings theory, this concept has
been expanded and examined in a variety of ways. Some of these generalizations are as
important as the prime ideals. Burton in [6] deﬁned the maximal ideals of R, an ideal P
of R is said to maximal ideal provided that P 6= R and whenever I is an ideal of R with
P ⊂ I ⊆ R, then J = R. A prime ideal P is said to be a prime ideal minimal over an
ideal I if it is minimal among all prime ideals containing I.

Let P be a proper ideal of R. Then the radical of P is denoted by Rad(P) and it is

deﬁned as written below:

Rad(P)={a ∈ R : an ∈ P for some positive integer n}

Note that Rad(P) is actually an ideal of the ring R which contains P (see [6]).

Let P be an ideal of R, P is said to be principal right ideal is given by P = {ar : r ∈ R}
for some element a. Conrad deﬁned Noetherian rings in [2]. A commutative ring R is
called Noetherian if each ideal in R is ﬁnitely generated. In [4], R is said to be principal
right ideal ring if every right ideal of R is a principal right ideal. We say that R is a
principal right ideal domain if R is a domain.

A prime principal left ideal ring (PPLIR) and domain (PPLID) are deﬁned sym-
metrically. A ring R is called a prime principal ideal ring (PPIR) if R is both a prime
principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) and a prime principal left ideal ring (PPLIR)

In Section Two, we introduce the concept of prime principal right ideal rings (PPRIR).
We say that P is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI) of R is given by P = {ar : r ∈ R}
for some element a, when P is a prime ideal of R. A ring R we say that a prime principal
right ideal ring (PPRIR) if every prime ideal is prime principal right ideal. A prime
principal right ideal ring R is called a prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID) if R
is a domain. We study rings with this property. Clearly, every principal right ideal rings
(PRIR) is prime principal right ideal rings (PPRIR). In Theorem 1, we show R/P is
a prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID) when R is a prime principal right ideal
ring (PPRIR) and P is a prime ideal of R. We investigate some basic properties of prime
principal right ideal ring (PPRIR).

2. Prime Principal Right Ideal Rings

In this section, we introduce and study prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR).

Deﬁnition 1. Let R be a commutative ring with identity 1 ∈ R.
1. A prime ideal P of R is prime principal right ideal (PPRI) is given by P = {ar : r ∈ R}
for some element a.
2. R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) if every prime ideal is prime principal
right ideal. A prime principal right ideal ring R is called a prime principal right ideal
domain (PPRID) if R is a domain.

Clearly, every principal right ideal rings (PRIR) is prime principal right ideal rings
(PPRIR). We show examples of prime principal right ideal rings in the following exam-
ples. For a ring R and n ∈ Z+, Mn(R) means the ring of n × n matrices over R and
In(R) = {rI : r ∈ R}, where I is the n × n identity matrix of Mn(R).

Example 1. 1. Every ﬁeld and division ring are prime principal right ideal ring.

2. Let R be a principal right ideal ring and J a subring of Mn(R) containing In(R).
Then J is a principal right ideal ring (see [3], Proposition 1.7), so J is a prime principal
right ideal ring. In particular, Mn(R) is a prime principal right ideal ring.

Theorem 1. Let R be a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR). Then P is a prime
ideal of R if and only if R/P is a prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID).

Proof. First, take P is a prime ideal of R and R is (PPRIR), so is the quotient ring
R/P. The only thing left is to make sure R/P doesn’t have any zero divisors. Assume the
following:

(x + P)(y + P) = P

In other words, the zero element of the ring R/P is the product of these two cosets. The
preceding equation clearly equates to a requirement that xy + P = P, or xy ∈ P . But by
assumption P is a prime ideal, so x ∈ P or y ∈ P . This is means that either the coset
x + P = P or y + P = P. Hence, R/P is without zero divisors. Therefore R/P is a
(PPRID).

We just invert the argument to establish the converse. Assume that R/P is (PPRID)

and xy ∈ P . This indicates, in terms of cosets, that

(x + P)(y + P) = xy + P = P

By assumption R/P has not zero divisors, so x + P = P or y + P = P. In each case,
one of x or y belongs to p, forcing P to be a prime ideal of R.

Note that, let R be a commutative ring with unity then every maximal ideal is a

prime ideal (see [6]).

Proposition 0.1. If R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR), then every max-
imal ideal is prime principal right ideal (PPRI).

Proof. Assume that R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR), so R is a commu-
tative ring with unity. Then every maximal ideal is prime ideal, but every prime ideal of
R is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI). Hence the maximal ideal is a prime principal
right ideal (PPRI).

2

The converse of Proposition 0.1 does not hold, the following example show that there
exist prime ideal of the prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) which is not maximal
ideal.

Example 2. Let R = Z × Z be a prime principal right ideal ring and P = Z × {0} be a
prime ideal of R. Since

with Z × Ze an ideal of R, then Z × {0} is not maximal ideal.

Z × {0} ⊂ Z × Ze ⊂ R

Proposition 0.2. Let R be a Boolean ring and (PPRIR). Then P is a prime principal
right ideal (PPRI) of R if and only if P is a maximal ideal of R.

Proof.
It suﬃces to show that if P is the prime principal right ideal (PPRI), P is
also the maximal ideal. Suppose that I is an ideal of R with P ⊂ I ⊆ R, what we need
to show is that I = R. Let x ∈ I and x /∈ P , then x(1 − x) = 0 ∈ P . But P is a prime
principal right ideal of R with x /∈ P , so 1 − x ∈ P ⊂ I. Then x and 1 - x in I, it follows
that 1 = x + (1 − x) ∈ I. As a result, the ideal I contains the identity and, as a result,
I = R. Since there is no appropriate ideal between P and the entire ring R, we come to
the conclusion that P is a maximal ideal.

Proposition 0.3. Let R be a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR). If P is a prime
principal right ideal (PPRI) of R, then P id a semiprime ideal of R.

Proof. Assume that P is a prime principal right (PPRI) of R, so R/P is a prime
principal right ideal domain (PPRID) by Theorem 1, and so R/P has no zero divisors.
Thus R/P has no nonzero nilpotent elements. Hence P is a semiprime ideal of R.

Theorem 2. A ring R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) if and only if for
each inﬁnite increasing sequence of prime ideals P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ P3 ⊂ ... in R, then Pn = Pn+1
for all large n.

(⇒) If P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ P3 ⊂ ... is an increasing sequence of prime ideals. Let
Pn be a prime ideal of R. Since R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR),

Proof.
P = Sn≥1
so P is a Prime principal right ideal (PPRI). Now, by increasing condition for each ﬁnite
subset of P lies in a common Pn, so a ﬁnite set of P is in some Pm. Thus P ⊂ Pm as
well as that Pm ⊂ P , so P = Pm. Then for all n ≥ m, Pm ⊂ Pn ⊂ P = Pm, so Pn = Pm.

(⇐) Suppose that R is a not prime principal right ideal ring, so R has a prime ideal
P that is not prime principal right ideal. Take p1 ∈ P . Since P is not prime principal
right ideal, so P 6= {p1r : r ∈ R} = (p1). Consequently, there is a p2 ∈ P − (p1)
but P 6= (p1, p2). Follow the same steps to take pn in P for all n ≥ 1 by making
pn ∈ P − (p1, p2, ..., pn−1) for all n ≥ 2. Then we have an increasing sequence of prime
ideals (p1) ⊂ (p1, p2) ⊂ ... ⊂ (p1, p2, ..., pn−1) ⊂ ... in R where each prime ideal is com-
pletely contained within the one after it, so this is contradiction. Hence R is a prime
principal right ideal ring (PPRIR).

Theorem 3. Let R be a prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID). If φ from R to R
is a surjective ring homomorphism, then φ is an injective ring homomorphism and thus

3

is an isomorphic ring homomorphism.

Proof. Let φ : R → R be a surjective ring homomorphism. The nth iteration φn,
let Pn = ker(φn) be a prime ideal of R and these prime ideals form an increasing chain
P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ P3 ⊂ ... since x ∈ Pn then φn(x) = 0 and then φn+1(x) = φ(φn(x)) = φ(0) = 0,
so x ∈ Pn+1. Since R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) by Theorem 2
Pn = Pn+1 for some n. Take x ∈ ker(φ), so φ(x) = 0. The map φn is surjective
map, so x = φn(y) for some y ∈ R. Thus 0 = φ(x) = φ(φn(y)) = φn+1(y).Therefore
x ∈ ker(φn+1) = ker(φn), so x = φn(y) = 0. Thus ker(φ) = {0}, so φ is an injective
ring homomorphism.

The converse of Theorem 3 is not true, the following example show this.

Example 3. Let R[X] be a prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID) since it is a
principal right ideal domain (PRID) and let φ : R[X] → R[X] by φ(x) = x2. The
homomorphism ring φ is an injective but not surjective.

Theorem 4. If R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) then R[X] is a prime
principal right ideal ring (PPRIR).

Proof. It is clearly if R = {0}, so suppose that R 6= {0}. To prove the theorem must
prove every prime ideal of R[X] is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI). By contradic-
tion, assume that P is a prime ideal of R[X] bu not prime principal right ideal. We have
P 6= (0). Deﬁned a sequence of polynomials f1, f2, f3, ... in P as the following:
1. Take f1 ∈ P − (0) with minimal degree.
2.Since P 6= (f1), take f2 ∈ P − (f1) with minimal degree. Note that deg(f1) ≤ deg(f2).
3. For n ≥ 2, if we have deﬁned f1, f2, ..., fn in P then P 6= (f1, f2, ..., fn), so we may
take fn+1 ∈ P − (f1, f2, ..., fn) with minimal degree.

We have deg(fn) ≤ deg(fn+1) for all n. The case n = 1 was already examined and

for n ≥ 2, fn and fn+1 are in P − f1, f2, ..., fn−1 so deg(fn) ≤ deg(fn+1).

Let dn = deg(fn) for n ≥ 1 and cn be the leading coeﬃcient of fn, so dn ≤ dn+1 and

fn(X) = CnX dn+ terms of a lower degree.

Now choose the prime ideal (c1, c2, ...) in R is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI)
since R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR). This prime ideal has elements
are all linear combination of ﬁnitely many cn, so (c1, c2, ...) = (c1, c2, ..., cm) for some m.

Since cm+1 ∈ (c1, c2, ..., cm), we have

cm+1 =

m

X
n=1

xncn

for some xn ∈ R. From dn ≤ dm+1 for n ≤ m, the leading term in fn(X) = cnX dn + ...
can be transformed into a degree dm+1 by using fn(X)X dm+1−dn = cnX dm+1 + ..., and
this is in P since fn(X) ∈ P and P is a prime ideal of R[X]. By the previous linear
combination of cm+1 the linear combination

m

X
n=1

xnfn(X)X dm+1−dn

is in the ideal (f1, f2, ..., fm) and its coeﬃcient of X dm+1 is P

m
n=1 xncn which equals the

4

leading coeﬃcient cm+1 of fm+1(X) in degree dm+1. The diﬀerence

fm+1(X) −

m

X
n=1

xnfn(X)X dm+1−dn

is in P and not 0 since fm+1 ∈ P −(f1, f2, ..., fm) with degree less than dm+1. But fm+1 has
a minimal degree in P − (f1, f2, ..., fm) and the previous diﬀerence is in P − (f1, f2, ..., fm)
with lower degree than dm+1. This is the contradiction. Thus P is a prime principal right
ideal (PPRI) of R[X].

In a single sentence, we would want to summarize this proof, ” use a prime ideal of

leading coeﬃcients”.

In the proof of Theorem 4, the prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) property
of R where we mentioned is used (c1, c2, c3, ...) = (c1, c2, ..., cm) for some m. To get the
contradiction in the evidence, all we need to do is cm+1 ∈ (c1, c2, ..., cm) for some m.
Since (c1) ⊂ (c1, c2) ⊂ (c1, c2, c3) ⊂ ..., the following property is what we require:
for
each inﬁnite increasing sequence of prime ideals P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ P3 ⊂ ... in R, Pm = Pm+1 for
some m. Of course this is implied by prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) property,
but it also implies the prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) property since a non-
prime principal right ideal ring has an inﬁnite increasing sequence of ideals with strict
containment at each step see the proof of Theorem 2.

Where did we apply the assumption that R is a prime principal right ideal ring
(PPRIR) in the proof of the Theorem 4? It is how we know the prime ideals (c1, c2, ..., cn)
for n ≥ 1 stabilize for large n, so cm+1 ∈ (c1, c2, ..., cm) for some m. The contradiction we
obtain from that really shows cm+1 /∈ (c1, c2, ..., cm) for all m, so the proof of Theorem 4
could be construed as proving the converse: if R[X] is not prime principal right ideal ring
then R is not prime principal right ideal ring.

Remark. The converse of Theorem 4 is true, if the ring R[X] is a prime principal right
ideal domain (PPRID) then R is a prime principal right ideal domain (PPRID), since
R ∼= R[x]/(x).
Corollary 4.1. If R is a prime principal right ideal ring then R[X1, ..., Xn] is a prime
principal right ideal ring.

Proof. The case of n=1 is in Theorem 4. For n ≥ 2, write R[X1, ..., Xn] as R[X1, ..., Xn−1][Xn],
with R[X1, ..., Xn−1] being a prime principal right ideal ring by the inductive hypothesis.
As a result, we have been limited to the most basic case.

Proposition 0.4. Let R be a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR). If P is a pri-
mary ideal of R then Rad(P) is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI) of R.

Proof. Suppose that P is a primary ideal of R, by proposition 4.1 in [1] the Rad(P)
is a prime ideal of R. But R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR), so Rad(P)
is a prime principal right ideal of R.

Proposition 0.5. Let R be a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR). If P is a prime
ideal of R then Rad(P) is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI) of R.

Proof. Suppose that P is a prime ideal of R, so Rad(P) = P. But R is a prime principal
right ideal ring (PPRIR), then every prime ideal of R is a prime principal right ideal
(PPRI), and then Rad(P) is prime principal right ideal (PPRI).

Theorem 5. A ring R is a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) if and only if every
nonempty collection T of a prime ideals of R contains the maximum element in terms of
inclusion there is a prime ideal in T not strictly contained in another prime ideal in T.

Proof. (⇒) Suppose that there is a nonempty collection T of a prime ideals in R which
there is no maximum member in terms of inclusion. Thus suppose we begin with a prime
ideal P1 in R. we can ﬁnd prime ideals recursively P2, P3, ... such that Pn−1 ⊂ Pn for all
n ≥ 2. Pn−1 would be a maximum element of T if there was no prime ideal in T strictly
containing Pn−1, which does not exist. This is contradiction of Theorem 2 .
(⇐) Let P be a prime ideal in R and T be the set of all a prime principal right ideal
(PPRI) contained in P. Suppose that I ∈ T no other element of T contains this, so I
is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI) in P and no other prime principal right ideal
(PPRI) of R contains I. we will prove P = I by contradiction, which would prove P is a
prime principal right ideal (PPRI). If P 6= I, take x ∈ P −I, since I is a prime principal
right ideal (PPRI), also I + (x) is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI) where (x) is a
prime ideal in R. So I + (x) ∈ T and so I ∈ I + (x) this is a contradiction of maximality
of I as a member of T. Hence P = I.

Theorem 6. Let R be a prime principal right ideal ring (PPRIR) and I be a proper
ideal of R. If every prime ideal minimal over I is prime principal right ideal (PPRI),
then there are only ﬁnitely many prime ideals minimal over I.

Proof. Let T = {P1, ...Pn : each Pi is a prime ideal minimal over I}. If H ∈ T we
have H ⊆ I, then any prime ideal P minimal over I contains some Pi, so {P1, ..., Pn} is
the set of minimal prime ideals of I. Now assume that H 6⊆ P for some H ∈ T . Let the
set S = {J : J is a prime ideal of R with I ⊆ J and H 6⊆ J for some H ∈ T }. Since
every element in T is a prime principal right ideal (PPRI), S is inductive and hence
by Zorn’s Lemma has a maximal element Q. But I ⊆ Q, Q contains a prime ideal P
minimal over I (see [5], Theorem 10). Thus P ∈ T , this is a contradiction.

3. Conclusions

In this study, we introduced the concept of prime principal right ideal rings which is a
generalization of principal right ideal rings. We investigated some basic properties of
prime principal right ideal rigs. As a proposal to further the work on the topic, we are
going to study the concepts of S-prime principal right ideal rings and graded S-prime
principal right ideal rings.
