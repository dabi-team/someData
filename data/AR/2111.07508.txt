Abstract: International economics has a long history of improving our understanding of factors 

causing  trade,  and  the  consequences  of  free  flow  of  goods  and  services  across  countries.  The 

recent shocks to the free-trade regime, especially trade disputes among major economies, as well 

as black swan events (such as trade wars and pandemics), raise the need for improved predictions 

to inform policy decisions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are allowing economists to solve 

such prediction problems in new ways. In this manuscript, we present novel methods that predict 

and associate food and agricultural commodities traded internationally. Association Rules (AR) 

analysis  has  been  deployed  successfully  for  economic  scenarios  at  the  consumer  or  store  level 

(such  as  for  market  basket  analysis).  In  our  work  however;  we  present  analysis  of 

imports/exports  associations  and  their  effects  on  country-commodity  trade  flows.  Moreover, 

Ensemble  Machine  Learning  (EML)  methods  are  developed  to  provide  improved  agricultural 

trade predictions, outlier events’ implications, and quantitative pointers to policy makers.  

Keywords:  International  Trade,  Association  Rules,  Ensemble  Machine  Learning,  Country-

Commodity Transactions, Black Swan Events, Gravity Models. 

1.  Introduction 

In recent  years, many  countries are concerned about  rising trade deficits  (value of exports less 

imports) and their implications on production, consumption, prices, employment, and wages. For 

instance,  the  United  States'  goods  and  services  trade  deficit  with  China  was  $345.6  billion  in 

2019  (USTR,  2020).  Such  large  gaps  are  forcing  countries  to  either  exit  trade  agreements  or 

enforce  tariffs,  (e.g.  Brexit,  U.S.  tariffs  on  Chinese  goods,  and  other  de-globalization 

movements).  Other  outlier  events  could  lead  to  additional  uncertainties  in  global  production

chains  and  irregularities  in  trade  of  essential  goods  (e.g.  soybeans,  steel,  aluminum,  and  beef). 

While traditional economic models aim to be reliable predictors, we consider the possibility that 

AI methods (such as AR and EML) allow for better predictions to inform policy decisions. The 

2020  U.S.  National  Artificial  Intelligence  Initiative  Bill  states:  “Artificial  intelligence  is  a  tool 

that  has  the  potential  to  change  and  possibly  transform  every  sector  of  the  United  States 

economy” (S.1558 – AIIA, 2020). As AI methods are applied across different domains, they are 

often presented with a stigma of being irrelevant or a “black-box”. Few studies have applied AI 

to  economics;  accordingly,  some  have  called  for  increased  attention  to  the  role  of  AI  tools 

(Mullainathan  and  Spiess,  2017).  A  study  by  the  National  Bureau  of  Economic  Research 

(NBER)  points  to  the  potential  of  economists  adopting  ML  more  than  any  other  empirical 

strategy (Athey and Imbens, 2017). While some success stories are recorded for deploying ML to 

international trade analysis, we present methods that elevate predictions’ accuracy through EML, 

and evidence-based policy making through AR. 

Open-government  data  provide  the  fuel  to  power  the  mentioned  methods.  Unlike 

traditional  approaches,  e.g.  expert-judgment  based  linear  models  or  time-series  methods,  EML 

and  AR  methods  provide  a  range  of  data-driven  and  interpretable  projections.  Prior  studies 

indicate the high relevance of AI methods for predicting a range of economic relationships with a 

greater  accuracy  than  traditional  approaches  (Athey  and  Agrawal,  2009).  With  recent 

international  trade  policies  garnering  attention  for  limiting  cross-border  exchange  of  essential 

goods  and  with  trade’s  critical  effects  on  production,  prices,  employment,  and  wages  (ERS, 

2020),  our  motivation  in  this  study  is  to  test  the  following  two-tier  hypothesis:  (a)  Trade 

transactions  can  point  to  country-commodity  associations  (i.e.  AR)  that  are  not  revealed  by 

traditional economic models. (b) Trade patterns are predicted on time and with higher accuracy 

Page 3 of 73 

 
if boosting models are using data from top world traders that are identified through clustering 

(i.e. EML). Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) developing a novel AR method for 

international trade, (2) providing trade predictions using EML that are superior to existing public 

sector predictions, (3) ML methods for the management of economic and trade policies during 

outlier events, (4) a review of the most important ML methods used in economics, (5) country-

specific  or  commodity-specific  trade  predictions,  and  (6)  an  open  source  R  dashboard  that 

encompasses all the mentioned ML methods and visualizations.  

Sections 1.1 and 1.2 present the motivation for AR and EML modeling. The next section 

(2) provides a review of traditional econometrics and presents the state of the art in applying AI 

methods to trade analysis. Section 3 introduces the methods (EML and AR) as they are applied 

to trade data; and section 4 presents all experimental results. Section 5 incorporates methods for 

validation,  anomaly  detection,  outlier  events  and  their  manifestations  on predictions.  Section  5 

also shows two use cases for policy making as well as other ideas for future work. Discussions, 

trade policy implications, and conclusions are presented in section 6. 

1.1 Beer and Diapers for International Trade 

The success of AR for online and brick and mortar commerce is undeniable. Amazon’s “people 

who  bought  this  item  are  also  interested  in…”  is  a  recommendation  engine  that  tells  us  what 

items have been bought together. Many other success stories exist: the famous beer and diapers 

association  at  grocery  stores,  Netflix’s  movie  recommendations,  Walmart’s  placing  of  bananas 

next  to  cereal  boxes,  and  Target’s  predictions  of  pregnancy  based  on  buying  trends  (MapR, 

2020). Those commercial algorithms that use AR are referred to as MBA. In our work, we ask 

the question, can MBA through AR be applied to international trade? Can we look into trade of 

Page 4 of 73 

 
 
commodities  between  countries  and  build  associations  that  could  manifest  trade  associations 

such as: “when the U.S. exports more Cereal to Mexico, Mexico will import less or no livestock 

and other animal products”. We look at trade flows and aim to illustrate how the waves of trade 

are influenced by an increase or decrease of commodity’s flow between countries.  

1.2 EML for Country-Commodity Trade 

EML  are  meta-algorithms  that  combine  several  Machine  Learning  (ML)  techniques  into  one 

model  to  decrease  bias  (such  as  through  boosting)  (Ke  et  al.,  2017),  and  improve  predictions 

(through using multiple methods). In this paper, we develop methods for trade predictions using 

boosting  and  k-means  clustering.  K-means  clustering  is  a  commonplace  method  for  grouping 

items using non-conventional means. We cluster the countries of the world, and use the highest 

quality  outputs  of  the  k-means  model  to  execute  tailored  predictions  through  boosting 

algorithms. Boosting is  a class of ML methods based on the idea that a combination of simple 

classifiers  (obtained  by  a  weak  learner)  can  perform  better  than  any  of  the  simple  classifiers 

alone. Additionally, boosting is used to classify economic variables, and measure their influence 

on trade projections. A ranking of variables is presented per commodity to aid in understanding 

relationships  between  variables  (for  instance:  GDP,  Distance,  and  Population),  and  their  effect 

on trade during conventional (white swan) and outlier (black swan) events.  

2.  AI and Econometrics 

Econometrics (and model calibration, and other empirical methods used by economists) aim to 

elucidate mechanisms and identify causalities, whereas AI aims to find patterns in the data. The 

challenge with the latter for any kind of forward-looking or policy analysis is the famous “Lucas 

Page 5 of 73 

 
 
 
Critique”. Lucas (1976) argued that the economic parameters of traditional econometric models 

depended implicitly on expectations of the policy making process, and that they are unlikely to 

remain constant as events change and policymakers alter their behavior. In section 5, we present 

methods (for outlier detection and model’s retraining) that aid policy makers in such situations, 

and allow them to amend their policies.  

Section 2.1 presents an overview of AI methods applied to trade; and section 2.2 outlines 

traditional econometrics, and contrasts both paradigms. 

2.1 Applying AI to Trade 

Few  studies  have  applied  ML  methods  to  economics.  Storm  et  al.  (2019)  provided  a 

comprehensive review of AI methods deployed to applied economics; especially their potential 

in informing policy decisions. In 2013, Gevel et al. published a book called "the Nexus between 

Artificial Intelligence and Economics". It was one of the first few works that introduced agent-

based  computational  economics  (Gevel  et  al.  2013).  One  year  later,  Feng  et  al.  (2014)  studied 

economic  growth  in  the  Chinese  province  of  Zhejiang  using  a  neural  networks  model.  Their 

method however, is very limited in scope, and proved difficult to deploy across other provinces 

in  China  or  other  geographical  entities  in  other  countries.  Abadie  et  al.  (2010)  developed  a 

similar model, but applied it to the rising tobacco economy in California. In 2016, Milacic et al. 

(2016)  expanded  the  scope,  and  developed  a  model  for  growth  in  GDP  including  its  major 

components: agriculture, manufacturing, industry, and services. See also Kordanuli et al. (2016) 

for an application of neural networks for GDP predictions. Falat et al. (2015) developed a set of 

ML  models  for  describing  economic  patterns,  but  did  not  offer  predictions. In  a  recent  study, 

Batarseh et al. (2019) presented boosting ML methods for trade predictions. In their study, many 

Page 6 of 73 

 
 
economic features were considered to identify which of them have the highest influence on trade 

predictions,  and  which  ones  could  be  controlled  and  tuned  to  change  the  forecasts.  Different 

commodities had different rankings of economic variables, however population and GDP of both 

countries and tariffs had some of the highest impact on whether two countries would trade major 

commodities  or  not.  AI  methods  are  categorized  into  3  areas:  ML  (including  supervised  and 

unsupervised), Deep Learning (DL), as well as Reinforcement Learning (RL). Table 1 presents a 

brief and relevant history of ML/DL/RL applications to international trade analysis.

No  method  is  found  in  literature  that  applied  AR  to  country-commodity  exports  and  imports 

(Serrano et al., 2015), and EML has not been extensively tested for international trade. The work 

presented in this paper addresses that gap.  

2.2 Traditional Econometrics for Trade 

A  key  objective  of  quantitative  economic  analyses  is  to  uncover  relationships  –  e.g.  demand, 

supply, prices or trade – for use in making predictions or forecasts of future outcomes. However, 

when the current systems generates forecasts for decision making, they require a range of ad hoc, 

expert-driven  or  a  combination  of  simple  forecasting  models  supplemented  by  subject  matter 

expertise  to  econometrics-based  methods  and  mega-models,  i.e.  applied  general  equilibrium. 

Employing  such  approaches,  many  international  institutions  and  government  agencies  project 

economic  variables  including  trade  flows  to  inform  decisions  in  national  and  multilateral 

contexts  (World Economic Outlook  –  International  Monetary  Fund, 2019;  Trade in  Goods and 

Page 8 of 73 

 
 
 
Services  Forecast,  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development,  2019;  World 

Trade Organization, 2019; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2019). These predictions are highly 

valued by producer and consumer groups as well as policymakers in making decisions (Karali et 

al. 2019). However, some of these predictions based on a combination of simple linear models 

and  expert  judgment,  have  limitations  (Isengildina-Massa  et  al.  2011).  For  instance,  U.S. 

Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Outlook for Agricultural Trade has forecast accuracy that 

is below 35% (USDA, 2019), while the long-term U.S. Agricultural Projections to 2030 does not 

provide  a  measure  assessing  the  quality  of  projections.  Similarly,  these  predictions  are  also 

limited in their ability to quantify the contribution of underlying economic factors. For instance, 

Chapter  4  (World  Economic  Outlook  –  International  Monetary  Fund,  2019)  notes  that  “the 

gravity model clearly distinguishes between the principal drivers of bilateral trade; these can be 

more difficult to disentangle in practice.” 

Mega-models  (using applied general  equilibrium techniques) have been  a  boon to  trade 

policy  research  over  the  past  25  years  (Kehoe  et  al.,  2017).  They  have  helped  change  the 

landscape  of  trade  negotiations  by  arming  developing  and  emerging  economies  with  tools 

generally used by their developed counterparts (GTAP, 2019). However, as Kehoe et al. (2017) 

note,  these  models  need  additional  theoretical  development  and  improved  measures  of  data 

employed for simulation of policy outcomes. These mega-models relying mostly on annual data 

are  not  nimble  enough  to  respond  to  short-  to  medium-term  informational  needs.  More 

importantly, policy uncertainty or uncertainty in general further limits both back-of-the envelope 

and  mega-modeling  approaches  to  inform  decision-making.  In  the  latter  case,  part  of  the 

challenge  is  the  static  nature  of  most  trade  models,  which  often  conduct  comparative  static 

analysis  of  trade  outcomes  from  deterministic  trade  policy  changes.  For  example:  Steinberg 

Page 9 of 73 

 
(2019)  offers  a  theoretical  model  incorporating  trade  policy  uncertainty.  Using  applied  general 

equilibrium  techniques,  he  finds  that  Brexit  had  a  negative,  but  small  effect  on  U.K.’s  GDP. 

Other  studies  exploring  the  empirical  effects  of  trade  policy  uncertainty  or  trade  war  include 

Amiti et al. (2019), Caldara et al. (2019) and Fajgelbaum et al. (2019).  

Little  guidance  exists  on  theoretical  modeling  of  trade  policy  uncertainty  and  its 

implications  for  producer  and  consumer  behavior.  As  a  result,  ad  hoc  approaches  to 

incorporating uncertainty can create specification bias in quantifying economic relationships and 

consequently,  less  precise  outcomes  on  future  agricultural  trade  patterns.  The  later,  i.e.  less 

precise forecasts, impacts producer and consumer decisions as well as government expenditures. 

These  mega-models  draw  information  from  a  variety  of  sources,  e.g.  elasticities,  which  can 

introduce additional specification errors or mismatch data distributions. 

While grappling with trade policy and other uncertainties, the availability of big data and 

advances  in  AI  software  systems  posed  new  challenges  to  conventional  approaches  (such  as 

gravity  models)  to  quantifying  complex  economic  relationships  (Varian  2014).  The  challenges 

include dealing with  the sheer volume of data (evolving from  spreadsheets  and SQL databases 

towards Hadoop clusters and distributed data), the lengthy list of variables available to explain 

such relationships (and associated collinearity issues), and the need to  move beyond static and 

linear models. AI has been offered as an alternative to address many of these challenges (Bajari 

et al. 2015; Mullainathan and Spiess 2017; Batarseh and Yang 2017; Athey and Imbens 2019). 

Several authors including Chief Economists of Google and Amazon have strongly advocated the 

use  of  big  data  and  AI  to  uncover  increasingly  complex  relationships  even  in  an  analysis  as 

simple as fitting a supply or demand function. The economics community is catching on, but the 

speed  of  AI  advances,  i.e.  new  techniques  emerge  every  month,  can  make  an  academic  study 

Page 10 of 73 

 
stale  by  the  time  peer  reviews  are  completed.  Nonetheless,  the  academic  community  facing 

seismic  shocks  from  advances  in  big  data  and  AI  has  been  called  on  to  revisit  time-tested 

theories and relationships (Mullainathan and Spiess 2017). In sum, traditional models – ad hoc, 

econometrics  or  mega-models  –  have  been  challenged  both  on  modeling  uncertainties,  and 

providing accurate and on-time information for policy and decision making. 

3.  Methods 

Data  for  this  project  are  from  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  Bilateral  Imports  dataset, 

which  comprises  annual  country  to  country  trade  data  from  1996  to  2018.  Data  come  from 

countries reporting imports from trading partners around the world, only countries that are part 

of  the  WTO  report  imports  (the  sample  of  countries  is  ~190).  International  trade  data  are 

organized by Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS Code System), and 

this study focused on the chapter level of the system: the 2-digit codes (HS-2). Data on the 96-

chapter 

level 

trade  products  are  downloaded 

from 

the  WTO  developer  portal 

(https://apiportal.wto.org/). Using Pandas and Numpy libraries in Python, data are loaded into a 

PostgreSQL  database  for  ease  of  analysis.  We  dig  deeper  (lower  aggregation)  for  the  EML 

models: data for EML are extracted from the General Agricultural Trade System (GATS) on the 

HS-4  level  for  prime  agricultural  commodities  (years  1960-2018);  from  this  web  portal: 

https://apps.fas.usda.gov/gats/default.aspx.  

Finally,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  data  are  collected  for  GDP  statistics 

(https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/), and U.S. Department of Commerce data have been 

collected  for  example  trade  outliers  in  Livestock,  and  overall  data  and  models’  validation

(presented in section 5). All cleaned datasets are shared in a public repository on Github (refer to 

the data availability statement).  

3.1 AR for Trade 

Mining frequent commodities that trade in association with each other has a direct implication on 

decision making. AR is a popular method for discovering hidden relations between variables in 

big datasets. Piatetsky and Shapiro (1991) describe analyzing strong rules discovered in datasets. 

Based  on  the  notion  of  strong  rules,  Agrawal  et  al.  (1993)  introduced  the  problem  of  mining 

association rules from transaction data. 

The idea of AR is as follows: Let X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} be a set of n commodities. Let T = 

{t1,  t2,  ...,  tn}  be  a  set  of  transactions  (where  Tt  is  the  total  number  of  transactions).  Each 

transaction in T has a unique ID and contains a subset of the commodities (X) that are traded. A 

rule is defined as an implication of the form Xa ⇒ Xb where Xa ,Xb ⊆ X and Xa ∩ Xb = ∅.  

The  sets  of  commodities  Xa  is  called  antecedents  (left-hand-side  or  LHS)  and  the  set  of 

commodities Xb is called consequents (right-hand-side or RHS) of the rule. 

Besides  antecedent-consequent  rules,  the  quality  of  the  associations  is  measured  through  the 

following three metrics:  

Support = 

𝑋𝑎+ 𝑋𝑏
 𝑇𝑡

  (1) 

Confidence = 

𝑋𝑎+ 𝑋𝑏
𝑋𝑎

  (2) 

Lift =  

(𝑋𝑎+ 𝑋𝑏)/ 𝑋𝑎
(𝑋𝑏/𝑇𝑡)

  (3) 

Support  indicates  that  for  example  67%  of  customers  purchased  beer  and  diapers  together. 

Confidence is that 90% of the customers who bought beer also bought diapers (confidence is the 

Page 12 of 73 

 
 
best  indicator  of  AR).  While  lift  represents  the  28%  increase  in  expectation  that  someone  will 

buy diapers, when we know that they bought beer (i.e. lift is the conditional probability).  

In  our  study,  AR  mining  is  performed  using  the  arules  library  in  R.  Data  are  pulled  and 

processed from PostgreSQL. Transactions in the data represent each country-country pair’s trade 

for  a  given  year.  The  goods  in  the  data  are  the  96  commodity  code  trade  dummies,  which  are 

boolean  values  depending  on  whether  trade  occurred  for  a  specific  country-country  pair  for  a 

given  year.  Apriori  association  rules  are  collected  with  a  minimum  support  of  0.35  and  a 

maximum number of antecedents set to 3. Results are visualized in plotly and exported using 

R. The top 4 million+ rules are pulled out of the models, and migrated into a structured relational 

SQL database (called: AR-Trade). The rules are pulled for U.S. trade for top trade countries in 

Asia (China, Korea, and Japan); as well as the top trade countries in Europe (UK, Spain, France, 

and  Germany).  Relational  SQL  tables  include  the  following  columns:  Lhs  (antecedent),  Rhs 

(consequent), Lhs name, Rhs name, Support, Confidence, Lift, Count, Country_O, Country_D.  

AR  results  are  plotted  using  an  R-Shiny  dashboard,  as  well  as  R  plots using  the  arulesViz 

library such as through this script: 

isS4(AR-Trade) 
AR-Trade@lhs 
plot(AR-Trade) 

Results  are  recorded  and  analyzed.  The  next  section  presents  EML  methods  (clustering  and 

boosting), and how they are deployed in experimental setup. 

3.2 EML for Trade 

Python libraries are used to deploy three boosting trees (GBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM) (Ke 

et al. 2017). Boosting trains weak learners sequentially, and in every cycle, each trying to correct 

Page 13 of 73 

 
 
its predecessor. Our boosting models offer an alternative to econometric approaches, which are 

seldom cross-validated.  

K-means is used to cluster countries (to identify big world traders), different k values are 

used to improve the EML process, the best clustering model is chosen as input for the boosting 

algorithms. The k-means model is executed using Euclidean distances, where distance from p to 

q: d (p, q) = Sqrt ((q1-p1)2 + (q2-p2)2 + … + (qn-pn)2)  (4) 

Countries  in  certain  clusters  can  be  better  indicators  to  international  trade  flows,  for 

example,  the  trade  values  of  France  have  higher  influence  on  the  predictions  quality  than  the 

trade values of Fiji. Accordingly, in this EML process, we identify the best k for clustering using 

silhouette coefficient and elbow diagram methods.  

Silhouette coefficient = max s(k). Where s(k) represents the mean s(i) over all data points 

in the trade dataset for a specific number of clusters k. The k-means model is developed for k=2 

to k=20, “powerful” country clusters are then used to create better trade predictions/boosting.  

We  aim  to  find  the  most  appropriate  Sum  of  Square  Errors  (SSE).  For  each  k,  a  score  is 

computed for SSE via the formula:  

SSE = ∑ (ti

𝑛=1

2)

𝑛

𝑛
∑ (ti
𝑛=1

−

)2
⁄   (5) 
n

SSE tends to decrease towards zero as k increases and so SSE is equal to 0 when k is equal to the 

number of data points in the trade dataset. Therefore, the goal is to choose a small value of k that 

has a low SSE. The result for all rows (n) and columns (t) is evaluated using an elbow diagram 

that indicates the most appropriate number of clusters. After clustering is performed, predictions 

are  evaluated  within  the  context  of  the  clusters.  Moreover,  a  “flag”  validation  and  anomaly 

detection  engine  is  deployed  (with  application  to  livestock)  to  allocate  outliers  and  inform 

commodity-specific policy making; outcomes are collected and presented.

availability statement). 

4.  Experimental Results 

The models’ results are illustrated through a R-Shiny dashboard, Tableau dashboard, other text 

tables, and R plots. 

4.1 Descriptive Maps and AR Results 

After the data are wrangled, few descriptive dashboards are developed, for instance, a heat map 

showing the history of trade is illustrated in Figure 1a. The rise of China is obvious in the figure, 

as  well  as  how  big  traders  seem  to  dominate  international  trade.  Figure  1b  illustrates  a 

comprehensive international trade map that shows the flow of trade between all countries of the 

world. The highlighted example shows the mentioned Asian and European countries of choice, 

as well as the U.S. Additionally, the trade map presents the evolution of trade for every country; 

in Figure 1b, the UK is selected and trade values from 2010 to 2018 are illustrated in a bar chart.  

The  Tableau  dashboards  presented  in  this  manuscript  are  shared  on  Tableau  public  (a  public 

online repository) and available for anyone for further exploration.  

Certain  countries  trade  more  with  each  other  due  to  treaties,  distance,  GDP,  and  other 

economic  variables.  Results  from  the  associations  (selected  top  confidence  sums),  for  all 

countries are presented in Table 2  (showing agricultural  and non-agricultural  associations). An 

extended version of the table, with top 100 rules is added to Appendix 1. Table 3 presents the top 

multiple antecedent rules by HS code, along with their confidence, support, and lift.

Figure 5 shows the R-Shinny app that is developed to present the 6-clusters model (as well as the 

associations and correlations), and how countries relate to each other in it. 

The  6-clusters  model  illustrates  the  countries  in  cluster  1  are  the  biggest  players  (USA,  Japan, 

China, EU…etc). That result is then used to predict the future of trade for year 2020 and beyond. 

For  example,  results  for  trade  predictions  through  the  XGBoost  Model  scored  predictions’ 

quality = 69%, and through LightGBM scored a quality of 88% (in contrast, GBoost scored the 

Page 21 of 73 

 
 
lowest of the three approaches). Data from cluster 1 countries are used to train the models, but 

scoring  is  applied  to  all  countries.  Parameter  tuning  for  boosting  models  include:  Number  of 

leaves, Maximum Depth of the tree, Learning Rate, and Feature fraction.  

Figure 4: Silhouette and Elbow Diagrams 

Figure 5: R-Shiny app for EML 

Small learning rates are optimal (0.01), with large tree depths. Additionally, to speed up training 

and avoid over-fitting, feature fraction is set to 0.6; that is, selecting 60% of the features before 

Page 22 of 73 

 
 
 
 
training  each tree. Early stopping round is  set  to  500;  that allowed the model  to  train  until  the 

validation score stops improving. Maximum tree depth is set to 8.  

  Those settings led to  the best  output through  LightGBM.  Sugar for instance had an R2  score 

(prediction  quality)  of  0.73,  0.88  for  Beef,  and  0.66  for  Corn  (three  essential  commodities). 

These initial  results confirm  the applicability of  EML methods to  projecting trade patterns and 

also  point  to  accuracy  gains  over  traditional  approaches.  However,  after  using  only  countries 

from  cluster  1:  the  models  yielded  even  better  results.  Figure  6  illustrates  the  boosting  models 

quality  (actual  vs.  predicted)  before  deployment  of  k-means  outputs  (i.e.  using  cluster  1),  and 

after (i.e. with and without EML). 

Figure 6: (a) Models quality without EML vs. (b) Models quality with EML 

Moreover,  EML  methods  presented  in  this  manuscript  allowed  for  the  extractions  of  the  best 

economic  variables  that  would  affect  trade  of  specific  commodities.  Distance  had  the  highest 

effect  (i.e. the U.S.is  better off trading beef to Canada  and Mexico, its two closest  neighbors). 

While Australia, being an island, has to focus its policies for beef exports on GDP measures, and 

the population of the importer. Feature Importance for all economic variables are (namely: split, 

Page 23 of 73 

 
 
 
gain.):  Distance:  1469,  6.38.  GDP  of  Exporter:  1431,  6.22.  Year:  993,  4.318.  Population  of 

Exporter: 882, 3.83. Population of Importer: 847, 3.68. Currency of Importer: 801, 3.48.  

  The next section (5) introduces a use case for contrasting two commodities (milk and corn) by 

economic  variables,  and  what  that  means  for  decision  making.  Over  2006-2017,  the  USDA 

forecast  accuracy (Ag outlook reports) was less than 35% (USDA  ERS, 2018). Their  accuracy 

improves to 92% only after having actual data for three-quarters of the forecasted year. Models 

presented  in  this  paper  offer  forecast  accuracy  in  the  69%  –  88%  range  (even  before  data  for 

three quarters are available).  

Albeit  models  presented  offer  higher  accuracy,  but  what  happens  when  those  data  patterns 

are majorly disrupted by an outlier event such as trade wars, embargoes, or pandemics? How are 

economic variables such as tariffs, production, and prices influencing policy during black swan 

events?  The  next  section  presents  methods  to  evaluate  such  shifts  in  trade  patterns  and  use  AI 

methods to provide pointers to policy alternatives. 

5.  Outlier Events and AI Methods 

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) updated their forecasts 

for the global economy. The IMF warned of soaring debt levels, as well as country’s economies 

contracting  (8%  contraction  for  the  US,  9.1%  for  Brazil,  as  well  as  10.5%  for  Mexico). 

Moreover, the IMF estimates an overall contraction of 4.9% in global GDP in 2020 (IMF, 2020). 

Figure 7 illustrates IMF’s Global GDP projections; the figure illustrates how Covid-19 lead to a 

major drop in 2020’s country-wise GDP. Such numbers provide a general overview of the global 

economy’s health; however, it is  not  clear how GDP rates will affect trade patterns around the 

world, as well as production, prices, and many other economic variables. 

Page 24 of 73 

 
 
Isolation forests, distance-based, and density-based approaches can be generally used for 

outlier detection within a learning environment, however, for explainability and clarity purposes, 

in  our  presented  boosting  models,  we  present  commodity-specific  variable  correlations  to 

support policy making during outlier events. For example, some commodities infer that the GDP 

of the importer is the main influencer (via classification measures) of the size of trade between 

both  countries.  Other  commodities  exchange  depends  on  distance  or  population  and  so  on. 

Hence,  by  looking  at  commodity-specific  changes  (within  different  contexts),  implications  on 

policies that shape production, pricing, or consumption of that commodity could be altered in a 

more acute manner.

5.1 Data during Black Swan Events 

In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department of Justice (DOJ) subpoenaed the four 

largest  meat  packers  in  the  US  (Tyson,  Cargill,  JBS,  National  Beef).  The  DOJ  looked  into 

Page 25 of 73 

 
 
 
 
allegations of price manipulation as prices paid to ranchers declined while retail meat prices rose. 

The “Big Four” meat packers account for more than 70% of beef processing in the U.S. (Dorsett, 

2020).  Outlier  events  affect  economic  variables,  and  so  during  such  black  swan  events, 

predictions  and  forecasts  ought  to  be  modified.  During  outlier  events,  historical  data  become 

much less dependable. Timeliness of data is a critical practical challenge as well. To estimate the 

current and future macroeconomic effects of Covid-19’s uncertainties, we need measures that are 

available in real time, or nearly so. This kind of analysis can aid in avoiding a serious disruption 

to economic activity (Fan et al., 2020). During such events, analysis is performed in uncharted 

waters.  Issues  arise such as the need to  use daily if not  hourly  data (but  not  monthly data)  for 

pattern  recognition  and  predictions.  Additionally,  decisions  become  timelier  and  need  to  be 

executed in a quick manner using real time analysis and on-demand analytics (Barro et al., 2020) 

(Eichenbaum et al., 2020). 

Accordingly, as established prior, commodities flow and trade are influenced differently by 

different economic variables. During outlier times, traditional models fail to re-learn in real time 

to provide an updated prediction based on hundreds of variables. The box below presents a milk 

and corn use case to shed a light on determinants of trade patterns  of these commodities using 

boosting. 

Usecase#1: 
While  all  industries  have  been  seriously  affected  by  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  food  and 
agriculture  have  been  among  the  hardest  hit  segments  of  the  U.S.  economy.  The 
primary reason lies in the composition of household food expenditures. The impacts of 
the pandemic appear to vary by commodity based on two critical issues: perishability 
and labor use. Perishables like milk are among the hardest hit. Specialty crops such as 
corn also depend on labor for growing and harvesting – both types of commodities are 
affected  during  outlier  events.  Figure  8 
importance  (using 
illustrates  feature 
classification tree splits) for milk trade and compares that to corn. 
We  consider  commodity-specific  distress  during  outlier  events,  for  instance,  on  the 
biggest milk exporters: New Zealand, Germany and the U.S. If we know that GDP rates 
(as  the  IMF  data  showed)  have  sunk  for  those  countries,  and  also,  production  is 

Page 26 of 73 

 
reduced  due  to  closures  and  shutdowns;  while  other  variables  such  as  language, 
distance, and trade agreements stay the same, we are able to retrain the model with 
updated values and produce new real-time predictions that are suitable for the context 
at hand.  

Figure 8: Economic variable importance for Milk and Corn (use case #1) 

Our  analysis  of  variables  effecting  milk’s  production  can  dictate  policy  decisions  at  the  Dairy 

Margin  Program  (DMC)  for  instance,  and  associations  of  milk  trade  using  our  AR  model.  For 

example, through measures taken by USDA based on the Farm Bill (USDA, 2018), post Covid-

19,  dairy  producers  are  granted  a  different  set  of  agricultural  loans  based  on  the  negative 

projections for production. 

Not all economic variables are influential during a pandemic, while other are more important 

to  consider  during  conventional  times  (such  as  distance)  and  during  policy  making  (such  as 

Page 27 of 73 

 
 
 
 
tariffs and production). In our boosting models, we considered the following economic variables 

(o  refers  to  origin,  and  d  refers  to  destination):  Distance,  Population_d,  GDP_d,  GDP_o, 

Population_o,  Colony_o,  Colony_d,  Landlocked_o,  GATT  membership_d,  Landlocked_d, 

Member  of  EU_o,  Hostility  level_d,  WTO  membership_d,  Hostility  level_o,  Member  of  EU_d, 

Sanction threat trade, Island_d, Sanction imposition trade, Island_o, Customs union agreement, 

Common  language,  FTA  agreement,  WTO  membership_o,  Preferential  trading  area  goods, 

GATT  membership_o,  Environmental  impact  assessment,  Preferential  trading  area  services, 

Continguity, Polity_d, Language_d, Tariffs, Polity_o, Latitude_o, Latitude_d, Language_o, and 

Year (all used in Figure 8). 

By using AI methods, issues such as endogeneity are marginalized. Most traditional methods 

for  high-dimensional  statistics  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  none  of  the  regressors  are 

correlated  with  the  regression  error  (i.e.  they  are  exogenous).  Yet,  endogeneity  can  arise 

incidentally from a large pool of regressors in cases of a high-dimensional regression. This leads 

to the inconsistency of the penalized least-squares method, and  to  possible false outcomes  and 

sub-optimal policies. Our methods are not affected by this notion. However, in the next section, 

we present methods for validation of trade data (including anomaly detection), as well as other 

potential methods such as RL and causal learning that we aim to explore as part of future work. 

5.2 Validation and Anomaly Detection 

In the system developed, a validation and outlier detection module is  deployed. The Validation 

engine presented in this section is based on work from Batarseh et al. (2017). The engine consists 

of  two  parts:  flag  validation,  and  anomaly  (i.e.  outlier)  detection.  We  worked  with  USDA 

analysts to define the “acceptable” ranges for numbers within a sector, for example, if production 

Page 28 of 73 

 
 
of milk exceeds a certain amount, then our system should raise a “flag”. For instance, for yearly 

values,  a  red  flag  means  that  the  number  is  not  within  the  accepted  historical  range,  and  it 

requires attention. Red flags are expected to be prominent during black swan events for example. 

An orange flag means the number is within the range but not the last 10 years, yellow means the 

value is within the last 10 years’ range, but not 5 years range, then blue indicates 5 years range, 

and green indicates 3 years. The flag system is applied to livestock, in use case #2. 

Another  measure  to  identify  outliers  is  using  statistical  methods:  Median  and  Median 

Absolute  Deviation  Method  (MAD).  For  this  outlier  detection  method,  the  median  of  the 

residuals is calculated. Then, the difference is calculated between each historical value and this 

median. These differences are expressed as their absolute values, and a new median is calculated 

and multiplied by an empirically derived constant to yield the median absolute deviation (MAD). 

If  a  value  is  a  certain  number  of  MAD  away  from  the  median  of  the  residuals,  that  value  is 

classified as an outlier. The default threshold is 3 MAD. This method is generally more effective 

than the mean and standard deviation method for detecting outliers, but it can be too aggressive 

in classifying values that are not really extremely different. Also, if more than 50% of the data 

points have the same value, MAD is computed to be 0, so any value different from the residual 

median  is  classified  as  an  outlier.  MAD  is  calculated  for  univariate  and  multivariate  outliers, 

using these two formulas; given a two dimensional paired set of data (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2) … (Xn,

5.3 Future Work 

As part of our future work, we aim to explore more AI methods for policy making. AI provides 

methods  for  causality  and  analysis  of  different  scenarios  and  alternatives.  For  example,  AI 

contextual  reasoning  could  be  deployed  to  define  the  context  of  an  analysis  (Stensrud  et  al., 

2003). However, in most cases, it is highly challenging to define what context is. Context could 

be infinite (Bazire et al., 2005), and so data that ought to be collected to define a complete and 

universal context are also potentially infinite (Batarseh and Kulkarni, 2019).  

Hanson et al. (2015) present an improvement on Ricardian trade models, in an approach 

that  runs  counter  to  recent  theoretical  research  in  trade;  they  rely  on  what  they  call  “deep 

variables”  (an  equivalent  to  context  variables  in  AI)  to  examine  dynamics  of  comparative 

advantage.  Context  however,  doesn’t  lead  to  understanding  causality  (a  notion  that is  major  in 

economics). An alternative to such modeling for big data sets are methods such as:  RL, Causal 

Learning (CL), and other data-driven algorithms that can more explicitly point to causation.  

For  instance,  the  RL  process  is  as  follows:  “the  process  starts  from  a  start  state  and  a 

number of actions are available to transform the start state to the next states. Similarly, for each 

Page 31 of 73 

 
 
of the next  states in  the search space, there  are actions to  transform  them into  yet  other states. 

These transitions are given or are learned from carrying out actions in the environment. Rewards 

and  punishments  are  given  accordingly  to  the  states  depending  on  whether  they  are  desired  or 

undesired states. One version of RL, called Q-learning updates the state-action values, called Q-

values,  and  causalities  between  actions  and  rewards  are  learned”  (Ho,  2017).  The  RL  process 

will  find  an  optimal  solution  path  to  that  state  (Watkins,  1989).  Q-learning  is  presented  in  the 

following formula: 

V(s)   =  Max of a (R (s, a)   +  γ V (s′))  (7) 

Where, s =  a particular  state; a = action; s′ =  state to  which the  model/agent  goes  from  s, 𝜸 = 

discount  factor;  R  (s,  a)  =  a  reward  function  which  takes  a  state  s  and  action  a,  and  outputs  a 

reward value; V (s) = value of being in a particular state. 

Causal learning however relates more to cause and effect: Knowing what events cause what 

other events provides the information for an intelligent system to predict what may happen next 

so  that  it  can  better  prepare  and  plan  for  the  future  (through  deductive  or  inductive  analysis). 

Causal  learning  also  provides  the  means  for  it  to  solve  problems  by  reasoning  backward  (i.e. 

counterfactuals): If I desire trade outcome X to increase or decrease, what actions do I need to 

take? (Ho, 2017). Such methods allow for acute and more detailed simulation of trade outcomes 

in alternative policy scenarios. 

Additionally, in our future work, we aim to deploy  HS4 and HS6 AR analysis to influence 

production decisions at farm level, provide commodity-based tariff insights, and other potential 

pointers  to  economic  policies.  A  digital  platform  with  “bigger”  data  shall  provide  acute 

associations on commodities’ trade. HS4 or HS6 ARs for example, can point to some interesting 

Page 32 of 73 

 
pairing of countries and  commodities. HS4 and  HS6  codes will produce  many more AR rules, 

which require more computational power, something we anticipate to do in the future. 

6  Policy Implications 

Methods presented in this paper provide ways of evaluating and managing policy scenarios. For 

instance, as presented in use cases 1 and 2, production of certain commodities can be hindered or 

amplified due to shifts in markets, changes in consumption, or other issues such as shipping and 

prices. Classification splits and gains lead to understanding these variables effects. Additionally, 

for  instance:  the  amount  of  food  available  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  available 

commodity supplies and nonfood use (i.e. disappearance) (USDA ERS, 2020): 

Total annual food supply of a commodity = supply (production + imports + beginning stocks) - 

disappearance (farm inputs + exports + ending stocks) (8) 

This  (supply  and  use)  allows  analysts  to  produce  reports  that  inform  policy  makers  on 

commodities  outlook,  and  so  on  policy  decisions  that  influence  variables  per  commodity.  As 

presented in the two use cases and by using the presented EML and AR models, decision makers 

have better understanding of these variables, as they can predict them better, validate them and 

find outliers. Examples on policies across the world during outlier events include:  

1. USA:  

a.  The  Covid-19  Food  Assistance  Program  provides  direct  relief  to  producers  who 

faced price declines and additional marketing costs due to the virus. 

b.  The  Office  of  Homeland  Security  has  commenced  a  series  of  events  to  educate 

the  Intelligence  Community  on  threats  to  agriculture  and  the  collection  of 

information on emerging threats. 

Page 33 of 73 

 
 
c.  Local  and  Regional  Food  Aid  Procurement:  On  March  26,  2019,  Foreign 

Agricultural Service (FAS) announced up to $15 million funding opportunity for 

Local and Regional Food Aid Procurement. 

2. Canada: 

a.  Farm Credit banks will receive support from the federal government that will allow for an 

additional  $5.2  billion  in  lending  capacity  to  producers,  agribusinesses,  and  food 

processors (IMF, 2020). 

3. South Africa and India:  

a.  New  funds  are  available  to  assist  producers  under  stress,  mainly  small-scale  farmers 

operating in the poultry, livestock, and vegetables sectors (IMF, 2020). 

Policy on data sharing is critical to such studies.  Encouraging government agencies to produce 

and share datasets on public repositories is essential for additional work in this context.  

7  Conclusions 

In recent years, there has been a challenge to achieve consensus at international bodies such as 

the  United  Nations,  World  Trade  Organization,  and  others.  For  instance,  the  Doha  round  of 

multilateral trade negotiations initiated in 2001 has not been concluded as of today. Some have 

argued that G20, a group of 20 nations that account for much of world’s GDP and population, 

has  become  increasingly  assertive  on  multilateral  policies.  For  instance,  In  Annex  II  of  G20’s 

Strategy  for  Global  Trade  Growth  (SGTG,  2020),  the  G20  declares  developing  a  world  trade 

outlook  indicator,  and  promoting  further  e-commerce  development.  That  includes  an  initiative 

on an electronic World  Trade Platform (e-WTP). The EML model illustrated in  this  paper can 

allow for contrasting between decisions made by G20 (i.e. mostly countries of cluster 1 in  our 

Page 34 of 73 

 
 
analysis) versus engaging all countries like at the United Nations. The experimental work in this 

article  indicates  the  high  relevance  of  EML  for  predicting  timely  trade  patterns  with  a  greater 

accuracy than traditional approaches.  

In  our  work,  we  show  that  transactional  agricultural  trade  data  could  be  used  to  enable 

insights  into  policy  making  such  as:  if  the  U.S.  is  exporting  beef  to  Mexico  ⇒  Mexico  will 

import less or no hay for animal feed (many other associations are presented). Similar to Market 

Basket Analysis (MBA) at grocery stores, trade trends for specific country-commodity pairs are 

directly  affected  by  other  “hidden”  HS-2  commodity  flows  (confidence  >  90%).  Top  world 

traders’  imports  and  exports  data  (such  as  G7  or  G20  countries)  perform  better  training  and 

scoring of AI models when compared to all international trade data (R2 > 69%). Countries of the 

world are best clustered in 6 groups based on their trade patterns. The 6-clusters model has low 

inter-cluster  distances  but  high  intra-cluster  distances;  and  it  influences  boosting  models  that 

result  in  better  predictions  than  traditional  governmental  outlooks.  EML  and  AR  models  can 

have a direct effect on trade policy making during conventional times and black swan events in 

the U.S. and the world; our work evaluates and validates such scenarios. 

Moreover,  we  show  methods  that  analyze  trade  associations.  AR  is  applied  to  HS2 

commodity codes (i.e. oil seeds trade lead to cotton trade). EML models are based on clustering 

of countries and re-training of ML models based on that. Additionally, we present two use cases 

(using  milk,  corn,  and  livestock)  for  validation  and  outlier  detection  of  economic  commodity-

specific  variables,  with  application  to  agricultural  economics.  EML  and  AR  models  allow  for 

simulation  of trade outcomes  in  alternative policy  scenarios. We offer a  superior alternative to 

current  approaches  in  public  sector  forecasting  of  trade  flows.  We  rely  on  big  data  and  AI  – 

instead of complex behavioral models with assumptions solved by accessing information from a 

Page 35 of 73 

 
myriad of studies. We can AI methods on data to allow for alternative and robust specifications 

of complex economic relationships and trade policies.
