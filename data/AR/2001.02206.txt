(Dated: 8 January 2020)

We report the implementation of a cost-effective approximation method within the framework of time-dependent op-
timized coupled-cluster (TD-OCC) method [J. Chem. Phys. 148, 051101 (2018)] for real-time simulations of intense
laser-driven multielectron dynamics. The method, designated as TD-OCEPA0, is a time-dependent extension of the
simplest version of the coupled-electron pair approximation with optimized orbitals [J. Chem. Phys. 139, 054104
(2013)]. It is size extensive, gauge invariant, and computationally much more efﬁcient than the TD-OCC with double
excitations (TD-OCCD). We employed this method to simulate the electron dynamics in Ne and Ar atoms exposed
to intense near infrared laser pulses with various intensities. The computed results, including high-harmonic gen-
eration spectra and ionization yields, are compared with those of various other methods ranging from uncorrelated
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) to fully-correlated (within the active orbital space) time-dependent complete-
active-space self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF). The TD-OCEPA0 results show a good agreement with TD-CASSCF
ones for moderate laser intensities. For higher intensities, however, TD-OCEPA0 tends to overestimate the correlation
effect, as occasionally observed for CEPA0 in the ground-state correlation energy calculations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years there has been a signiﬁcant breakthrough
in the experimental techniques to measure and control the
motions of electrons in atoms and molecules, for example,
measurement of the delay in photoionization1,2, migration
of charge in a chemical process3,4 and dynamical change of
the orbital picture during the course of bond breaking or
formation5–7. Atoms and molecules interacting with laser
pulses of intensity 1014 W/cm2 or higher in the visible to
mid-infrared region, show highly nonlinear response to the
ﬁelds such as above-threshold ionization (ATI), tunneling ion-
ization, nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) and high-
harmonic generation (HHG). All these phenomena are by na-
ture nonperturbative8. The essence of the attosecond science
lies in the HHG9–11, one of the most successful means to
generate ultrashort coherent light pulses in the wavelength
ranging from extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) to the soft x-ray
regions12–15, which can be used to unravel the electronic
structure5,6 or dynamics4,16 of many-body quantum systems.
The HHG spectrum is characterized by a plateau where the in-
tensity of the emitted light remains nearly constant up to many
orders, followed by a sharp cutoff17.

A whole lot of numerical methods have been developed
to understand atomic and molecular dynamics in the in-
tense laser ﬁeld (For a comprehensive review on various
wavefunction-based methods for the study of laser-induced
electron dynamics, see Ref. 18) to catch up with the progress

in the experimental techniques. In principle, “the best” one
could do is to solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
(TDSE) to have an exact description. However, the exact solu-
tion of the TDSE is not feasible for systems containing more
than two electrons19–28. As a consequence, single-active elec-
tron (SAE) approximation has been widely used, in which the
outermost electron is explicitly treated with the effect of the
other electrons modeled by an effective potential. The SAE
model has been successful in numerically exploring various
high-ﬁeld phenomena29,30. However, the missing electron cor-
relation in SAE makes this method at best qualitative.7

Among other established methods,

the multiconﬁgura-
tion time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF)31–35 and time-
dependent complete-active-space self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-
CASSCF)36–38 are the most competent theoretical methods for
the study of the laser-driven multielectron dynamics where
both conﬁguration interaction (CI) coefﬁcients and the or-
bitals are propagated in time. The time-dependent (or op-
timized in the sense of time-dependent variational principle)
orbital formulation widens the applicability of these methods
by allowing to use a fewer number of orbitals than the case
of ﬁxed orbital treatments. Though powerful, the dilemma
with these full CI-based methods is the applicability to large
atomic or molecular systems due to the factorial escalation
of the computational cost with respect to the number of elec-
trons. To subjugate this difﬁculty, more approximate, thus
computationally more efﬁcient time-dependent multiconﬁgu-
ration self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-MCSCF) methods have been
developed, based on the truncated CI expansion within the
chosen active orbital space39–42 , compromising size exten-
sivity.

To regain the size extensivity,

the coupled-cluster
expansion43–45 of the time-dependent wavefunction emerges

 
 
 
 
 
 
naturally as an alternative to the truncated CI expansion. The
initial ideas of developing time-dependent coupled-cluster go
back to as early as 1978 by Sch¨onhammer and Gunnarsson46,
and Hoodbhoy and Negele47,48. Here we take note of a
few theoretical works on the time-dependent coupled-cluster
method for time-independent Hamiltonian49–53 and a few re-
cent applications of the method with ﬁxed orbitals54,55. Hu-
ber and Klamroth56 were the ﬁrst to apply the coupled-cluster
method (with single and double excitations) to laser-driven
dynamics of molecules, using time-independent orbitals and
the CI wavefunction reconstructed from the propagated CC
amplitudes to evaluate the expectation value of operators.

In 2012, Kvaal pioneered a time-dependent coupled-cluster
method using time-dependent orbitals for electron dynamics,
designated as orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster
(OATDCC) method57. Based on Arponen’s bi-orthogonal
formulation of the coupled-cluster theory58, the OATDCC
method is derived from the complex-analytic action func-
tional using time-dependent biorthonormal orbitals. Recently,
we have also developed time-dependent optimized coupled-
cluster (TD-OCC) method59 based on the real action func-
tional using time-dependent orthonormal orbitals. The TD-
OCC method is a time-dependent extension of the orbital op-
timized coupled-cluster method popular in the stationary elec-
tronic structure theory60–63. It is not only size extensive, but
also gauge invariant, and scales polynomially with respect
to the number of active electrons N . Theoretical as well as
numerical comparison of closely-related OATDCC and TD-
OCC methods is yet to be done, and will be discussed else-
where. (See Refs. 64 and 65 for recent theoretical accounts on
orbital-optimized and time-dependent coupled-cluster meth-
ods, and Refs. 66 and 67 for the gauge-invariant coupled-
cluster response theory with orthonormal and biorthonormal
orbitals, respectively.)

We have implemented TD-OCC method with double ex-
citations (TD-OCCD) and double and triple excitations (TD-
OCCDT) within the chosen active space59, of which the com-
putational cost scales as N 6 and N 8, respectively. Such scal-
ings are milder than the factorial one in the MCTDHF and
TD-CASSCF methods; nevertheless, a lower cost alterna-
tive within the TD-OCC framework is highly appreciated to
further extend the applicability to heavier atoms and larger
molecules interacting with intense laser ﬁelds.

One such low-cost model is a family of the methods called
coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA), originally intro-
duced in 1970’s68–74.
In particular, the simplest version of
the family, denoted as CEPA0 (See Sec. II for the deﬁnition.),
is recently attracting a renewed attention75–78 due to its high
cost-performance balance. The orbital-optimized version of
this method (OCEPA0) has been also developed and applied to
the calculation of, e.g, equilibrium geometries and harmonic
vibrational frequencies of molecules79, which motivated us to
extend it to the time-dependent problem.

In the present article, we report the implementation of the
time-dependent, orbital-optimized version of the CEPA0 the-
ory, hereafter referred to as TD-OCEPA0. Pilot applications
to the simulation of induced dipole moment, high-harmonic
spectra, and ionization probability in three different laser

2

intensities for Ne and Ar are reported. We compare TD-
OCEPA0 results with those of other methods ranging from
uncorrelated TDHF, TD-MCSCF with a truncated CI expan-
sion, TD-OCCD, and fully correlated TD-CASSCF, using the
same number of active orbitals (except for TDHF) to quantita-
tively explore the performance of TD-OCEPA0. The compu-
tational cost of TD-OCEPA0 scales as N 6, which is formally
the same as that of TD-OCCD; however as shown in Sec. II,
one need not solve for the double deexcitation operator Λ2,
but it is sufﬁcient to propagate the double excitation operator
T2 since Λ2=T †
2 . This leads to a great saving of the computa-
tional time as numerically demonstrated in Sec. III.

The manuscript is arranged as follows. A concise descrip-
tion of the TD-OCEPA0 method is presented in Sec. II. Sec-
tion III discusses the computational results. Finally, we made

units unless stated otherwise, and Einstein convention is im-
plied throughout for summation over orbital indices.

where xi = (ri, σi) is a composite spatial-spin coordinate.

The complete set of 2nbas spin-orbitals (labeled with
µ, ν, γ, λ) is divided into nocc occupied (o, p, q, r, s) and
2nbas − nocc virtual spin-orbitals having nonzero and van-
ishing occupations, respectively, in the coupled-cluster (or
MCSCF) expansion of the total wavefunction. The occupied
spin-orbitals are classiﬁed into ncore core spin-orbitals which
are occupied in the reference Φ and kept uncorrelated, and
nact = nocc − ncore active spin-orbitals (t, u, v, w) among
which the Nact = N − ncore active electrons are correlated.

The active spin-orbitals are further splitted into those in the
hole space (i, j, k, l) and the particle space (a, b, c, d), which
are occupied and unoccupied, respectively, in Φ. The core
spin-orbitals can also be splitted into those in the frozen-core
space (i(cid:48)(cid:48), j(cid:48)(cid:48)) which are ﬁxed in time, and the dynamical-core
space (i(cid:48), j(cid:48)) which are propagated in time36.

Hereafter we refer to spin-orbitals simply as orbitals. [Note
that Refs. 36,37,42 for TD-MCSCF methods deal with the
equations of motion (EOMs) for spatial orbitals.] The system
Hamiltonian (2) is equivalently written as

ˆH = E0 + f µ

ν { ˆEµ

νλ { ˆEµγ

where E0 = (cid:104)Φ| ˆH|Φ(cid:105), f µ
νj (j running over core
and hole spaces), vµγ

implies that the operator inside is normal ordered relative to
the reference.

In summary, the TD-OCEPA0 method is deﬁned by the EOMs
of ˆT2 amplitudes [Eq. (18)] and orbitals [Eq. (25)], with
the hole-particle mixing determined by solving Eq. (22) and
RDMs given by Eqs. (29).

a The overlap, one-electron, and two-electron repulsion integrals over
Gaussian basis functions are generated using Gaussian09 program
(Ref. 82), and used to propagate EOMs in imaginary time in the
orthonormalized Gaussian basis, with a convergence threshold of 10−15
Hartree of energy difference in subsequent time steps.

contrast to the fact that Eq. (A2) should be solved for TD-
OCCD. These simpliﬁcations make TD-OCEPA0 computa-
tionally much more efﬁcient than TD-OCCD, as numerically
demonstrated in Sec. III.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Ground-state energy

We have implemented the TD-OCEPA0 method for atom-
centered Gaussian basis functions and spherical ﬁnite-element
discrete variable representation (FEDVR) basis for atoms,
both with spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted treatments, by
modifying the TD-OCCD code described in Ref. 59. Exploit-
ing the feasibility of the imaginary time relaxation to obtain
the ground state59, we ﬁrst computed the ground-state en-
ergy of Be and Ne atoms with standard Gaussian basis sets,
and compare the results with those obtained by PSI4 program
package80, in which the time-independent OCEPA0 method
is implemented. To facilitate the comparison, the number of
active spatial orbitals nact/2 are set to be the same as the num-
ber of basis functions nbas, since this is the only capability of
the PSI4 program. In this case, there are no virtual orbitals
(See Sec. II B for the deﬁnition.), and therefore, the ﬁrst term
of Eq. (25) vanishes. We also take an option of imaginary-
propagating amplitudes only, with all orbitals frozen at the
canonical HF solution, to obtain the ﬁxed-orbital CEPA0 en-
ergy.

culated with TDHF, TD-OCISD, TD-OCEPA, TD-OCCD, and TD-
CASSCF methods.

The calculated total energies listed in Table I demonstrate
a virtually perfect agreement of the results of this work and
PSI4 program, both for CEPA0 and OCEPA0 methods and for
Be and Ne atoms (with a small discrepancy due to a digit trun-
cation of Gaussian one- and two-electron integrals), which
conﬁrms the correctness of our implementation.

It is also observed that, for both Be and Ne, the OCEPA0
energies are noticeably lower than the OCCD ones, and for
the Be case, the OCEPA0 energy is slightly lower than the
FCI energy. Such an overestimation of the correlation energy
is usually considered not critical, and more than compensated
by the size extensivity in the stationary case.

B. Application to electron dynamics in Ne and Ar

Next, we apply the TD-OCEPA0 method to the laser-driven
electron dynamics in Ne and Ar atoms. Within the dipole ap-
proximation in the velocity gauge, the one-electron Hamilto-
nian is given by

where Z is the atomic number, A(t) = − (cid:82) t E(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48) is the
vector potential, with E(t) being the laser electric ﬁeld lin-
early polarized along z axis. It should be noted that TD-OCC
method (including TD-OCEPA0) is gauge invariant; length-
gauge and velocity-gauge simulations, upon numerical con-
vergence, give the same result for observables. The velocity

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 3T , and E(t) = 0 otherwise, with the cen-
tral wavelength λ = 2π/ω0 = 800 nm, the period T =

0 . We
consider three different intensities 5×1014 W/cm2, 8×1014
W/cm2, and 1×1015 W/cm2 for Ne, and 2×1014 W/cm2,
4×1014 W/cm2, and 6×1014 W/cm2 for Ar.

The orbital functions are represented by the spherical
FEDVR basis37,89, with the maximum angular momentum
lmax = 47 for Ne and lmax = 63 for Ar, and the FEDVR
basis supporting the radial coordinate 0 < r < 240 using 63
ﬁnite elements each containing 21 (for Ne) and 23 (for Ar)
DVR functions. The absorbing boundary is implemented by a
cos1/4 mask function switched on at r = 180 to avoid reﬂec-
tion from the box boundary. The ground state of each method
is obtained by the imaginary time relaxation, and then the real-
time dynamics are simulated starting from the ground state.
The Fourth-order exponential Runge-Kutta method90 is used
to propagate the EOMs with 10000 time steps for each optical
cycle.

We compare the performance of the following methods: (i)
TDHF, (ii) TD-MCSCF with a TDHF determinant and singly
and doubly excited conﬁgurations included (TD-OCISD), (iii)
TD-OCCD, (iv) TD-OCCDT, and (iv) TD-CASSCF as the
fully correlated reference for a given number of active or-
bitals. In all the methods, the 1s orbital of Ne, and 1s2s2p
orbitals of Ar are kept frozen at the canonical Hartree-Fock
orbitals, and for the correlated approaches (ii)-(iv) the eight

6

valence electrons are correlated among 13 active orbitals. The
method (ii) was ﬁrst introduced in Ref. 40, and referred to
as the time-dependent restricted-active-space self-consistent-
ﬁeld method.
It can also be considered a specialization of
more general time-dependent occupation-restricted multiple-
active-space method37. Here we denote the method as TD-
OCISD (time-dependent optimized CI with singles and dou-
bles) for simplicity.

The simulation results are given in Figs. 1-3 for Ne and
Figs. 4-6 for Ar. For each atom, we report the time evolution
of the dipole moment [Figs. 1 and 4], the ionization proba-
bility [Figs. 2 and 5], and the HHG spectra [Figs. 3 and 6].
The dipole moment is evaluated as a trace (cid:104)ψp|ˆz|ψq(cid:105)ρq
p us-
ing the 1RDM, and the ionization probability is deﬁned as
the probability of ﬁnding an electron outside a sphere of ra-
dius 20 a.u, computed by an expression using 1RDM and
2RDM91. The HHG spectrum is obtained as the modulus
squared I(ω) = |a(ω)|2 of the Fourier transform of the ex-
pectation value of the dipole acceleration, which, in turn, is
obtained with a modiﬁed Ehrenfest expression37. The TD-
OCCDT results of the dipole moment and the ionization prob-
ability are not shown, since they meet a virtually perfect
agreement with TD-CASSCF ones. The HHG spectrum is
shown only for TDHF, TD-OCEPA0, TD-OCCD, and TD-
CASSCF methods [Figs. 3(a)-(c) and 6(a)-(c)] to keep a visi-
bility, and an absolute relative deviation

of the spectral amplitude a(ω) from the TD-CASSCF value is
reported for each method [Figs. 3(d)-(f) and 6(d)-(f)]. Note
that both I(ω) and δ(ω) are plotted in the logarithmic scale,
and δ(ω) = 1 corresponds to a 100% deviation from the TD-
CASSCF amplitude.

The dipole moment (Fig. 1) and the ionization probability
(Fig. 2) of Ne atom show a general trend that the deviation of
results for each method from TD-CASSCF ones decreases as
TDHF (cid:29) TD-OCISD > TD-OCEPA0 ≈ TD-OCCD > TD-
OCCDT. The HHG spectra [Fig. 3 (a)-(c)] are well reproduced
by all the methods, except a systematic underestimation of the
intensity by TDHF, with the magnitude of the error amount-
ing to 100% of the TD-CASSCF spectral amplitude as shown
in Fig. 3 (d)-(f). The magnitude of the error depends weakly
on the harmonic order at the plateau region, which decreases
again as TDHF (cid:29) TD-OCISD > TD-OCEPA0 ≈ TD-OCCD
> TD-OCCDT. The Ne atom is characterized by its large ion-
ization potential of 21.6 eV, resulting in relatively low ioniza-
tion probabilities (Fig. 2) for the present laser pulses. In that
case, TD-OCEPA0 and TD-OCCD give a notably similar, and
accurate description of dynamics, implying that the trunca-
tion after the doubles amplitudes and the linearization of the
Lagrangian [Eq. 16] are both justiﬁed.

The Ar atom, having a lower ionization potential of 15.6
eV, exhibits a richer dynamics than Ne, e.g, a larger-amplitude

oscillation of the dipole moment (Fig. 4), ionization probabil-
ities as high as 70% (Fig. 5), and HHG spectra characterized
by a dip around 34th harmonic related to the Cooper mini-
mum of the photoionization spectrum92 at the same energy
(Fig. 6). The trend of the accuracy of each method is similar
to the case for Ne, except that TD-OCEPA0 and TD-OCCD
give noticeably different descriptions of dynamics.
In gen-
eral, TD-OCEPA0 tends to capture a larger part of the correla-
tion effect (the difference between TDHF and TD-CASSCF)
than TD-OCCD does. This results in, on one hand, a better
agreement of the TD-OCEPA0 results (than TD-OCCD) with
TD-CASSCF ones for lower intensity cases [Fig. 4 (a),(b),
Fig. 5 (a),(b), and Fig. 6 (d),(e)], and, on the other, leads to
an overestimation of the correlation effect for the highest in-
tensity [Fig. 4 (c), Fig. 5 (c), Fig. 6 (f)], somewhat analogous
to the overestimation of the ground-state correlation energy as
discussed in Sec. III A.

The nonlinear exponential parametrization in TD-OCCD
seems to play a role in correcting the overestimation, and the
inclusion of the triple excitations (TD-OCCDT) is essential

to retain the decisive accuracy across the employed range of
the laser intensity. Despite the aforementioned overestima-
tion of the correlation effect for higher intensities, we judge
that the present results of TD-OCEPA0 are quite encourag-
ing; it clearly outperforms TD-OCISD for all properties of
both atoms, and at least performs equally as TD-OCCD for a

moderate laser intensity.

a CPU time spent for the simulation of Ar atom with nact active orbitals

and Nact active electrons (nacte-Nacto), recorded and accumulated over
1000 time steps of a real-time simulation (I0 = 2 × 1014 W/cm2 and
λ = 800 nm.), using an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU with 12 processors having
a clock speed of 3.33GHz.

Finally, we compare the computational cost of TD-
OCEPA0 and TD-OCCD methods. Table II reports the central
processor unit (CPU) time for the computational bottlenecks
differing in these two methods, with varying numbers of ac-
tive electrons and active orbitals. The largest active space with
18 electrons and 18 orbitals (18e-18o) is challenging for the
fully correlated TD-CASSCF.

First, depending on the active space conﬁgurations, the
evaluation of the ˆT2 equation of the TD-OCEPA0 [Eq. (18)]
is 1.9∼2.5 times faster than that of TD-OCCD [Eq. (A1)].
A bigger computational gain comes from the fact that one
need not solve for the Λ2 equation, which, for TD-OCCD
[Eq. (A2)] takes longer than that for the ˆT2 equation because

of more mathematical operations involved. A further signiﬁ-
cant cost reduction is obtained by TD-OCEPA0 for the 2RDM
evaluation [Eqs. (29d)], which is 5.5∼7.2 times faster than the
TD-OCCD case [Eqs. (A3d)]. As a whole, the TD-OCEPA0
simulation with, e.g, the (18e-18o) active space achieves 6.3
times speed up relative to the TD-OCCD simulation with the
same active orbital space.

IV. SUMMARY

We have presented the implementation of TD-OCEPA0
method as a cost-effective approximation within the TD-OCC
framework, for the ﬁrst principles study of intense laser-driven
multielectron dynamics. The TD-OCEPA0 method retains the
important size-extensivity and gauge-invariance of TD-OCC,
and computationally much more efﬁcient than the full TD-
OCCD method. As a ﬁrst numerical test, we applied the
present implementation to Ne and Ar atoms irradiated by an
intense near infrared laser pulses with three different inten-
sities to compare the time-dependent dipole moment, the ion-
ization probability, and HHG spectra with those obtained with
other methods including the fully correlated TD-CASSCF
methods with the same number of active orbitals.
It is ob-
served that, for the highest laser intensity, with sizable ion-
ization, the TD-OCEPA0 tends to overestimate the correla-
tion effect deﬁned as the difference between TDHF and TD-
CASSCF descriptions. For moderate intensities, however, the
TD-OCEPA0 method performs at least equally well as TD-
OCCD with a substantially lower computational cost.
It is
anticipated that the present TD-OCEPA0 method serves as an
important theoretical tool to investigate ultrafast and/or high-
ﬁeld processes in chemically relevant large molecular sys-
tems.
