Abstract

Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) allows for rapid, high-sensitivity determination of trace
impurities, notably the primordial radioisotopes 238U and 232Th, in candidate materials for low-background rare-event
search experiments. We describe the setup and characterisation of a dedicated low-background screening facility at
University College London where we operate an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS. The impact of reagent and carrier gas purity
is evaluated and we show that twice-distilled ROMIL-SpATM-grade nitric acid and zero-grade Ar gas delivers similar
sensitivity to ROMIL-UpATM-grade acid and research grade gas. A straightforward procedure for sample digestion and
analysis of materials with U/Th concentrations down to 10 ppt g/g is presented. This includes the use of 233U and 230Th
spikes to correct for signal loss from a range of sources and veriﬁcation of 238U and 232Th recovery through digestion
and analysis of a certiﬁed reference material with a complex sample matrix. Finally, we demonstrate assays and present
results from two sample preparation and assay methods: a high-sensitivity measurement of ultra-pure Ti using open
digestion techniques, and a closed vessel microwave digestion of a nickel-chromium-alloy using a multi-acid mixture.

1. Introduction

Rare event search experiments such as those seeking in-
teractions from galactic dark matter scattering or evidence
of neutrino-less double beta decay (0νββ) require con-
struction from intrinsically radio-pure materials to limit
radiogenic backgrounds. Experiments must conduct radio-
assay campaigns to select materials and to accurately char-
acterize residual radioactivity for the experiment’s back-
ground model against which any observed excess will be
evaluated and statistical conﬁdence ascribed. The radioac-
tive isotopes 238U and 232Th and their decay-chain progeny
are of particular concern, contributing the bulk of the γ-
ray, α-particle, and, via spontaneous ﬁssion and (α,n) re-
actions, neutron-induced backgrounds.

Comprehensive radio-assay campaigns now increasingly
deploy multiple techniques to build a high-precision back-
ground model, and to meet sample throughput require-
ments during the experiment’s construction phase. Mass
spectrometry techniques such as ICP-MS can be used to
directly measure trace quantities of 238U and 232Th, de-
livering assays from small samples that are digested and
screened with turnaround times on the order of 1–2 days.
ICP-MS can achieve part-per-trillion (ppt) g/g level sen-
sitivity to 238U and 232Th when sample preparation pro-
tocols with stringent cleanliness constraints are used to
limit contamination [1, 2, 3]. Gamma-spectroscopy is used

to assay larger samples, including ﬁnished components,
over several weeks to determine the activities of the de-
cay chain daughters [4]. Other techniques such as Glow-
Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GD-MS) and Neutron Ac-
tivation Analysis (NAA) may also be used for some materi-
als not well-suited to either ICP-MS or gamma-spectroscopy.
Here we present results from a new ICP-MS facility
at University College London (UCL) constructed to per-
form radio-assays in support of rare-event searches, such
as the ‘Generation-2’ LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter Ex-
periment [5]. In Section 2 we give an overview of the UCL
ICP-MS facility and investigate the impact of reagent and
Ar gas purity on achievable sensitivity. Then,
in Sec-
tion 3, we describe a straightforward procedure for rou-
tine and fast-turnaround of materials with U/Th concen-
trations down to 10 ppt g/g. We present detection lim-
its for diﬀerent vessel cleaning protocols and describe the
use of 230Th and 233U spikes for signal loss correction. A
certiﬁed reference material representing a realistic sample
matrix is processed to verify overall U/Th signal recovery.
Finally, in Section 4 we present results from an open di-
gestion of ultra-pure Ti and a closed vessel digestion of a
nickel-chromium-alloy requiring multi-acid digestion.

2. Laboratory Overview

The UCL ICP-MS facility was installed and commis-
sioned in a newly constructed ISO Class 6 cleanroom in
late 2015. The primary instrument is an Agilent 7900 ICP-
MS with an instrument sensitivity to U and Th down to

10−15–10−14 g/g (1–10 parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) g/g).
The ICP-MS is ﬁtted with an integrated auto-sampler for
high-speed discrete sample uptake with a low-ﬂow, Peltier-
cooled sample introduction system. The system octopole
can provide species discrimination through interference re-
moval by running in either the He collision or H2 reaction
gas mode. High-purity Ar (N5.5/N5.0), He and H2 (N6.0)
are introduced to the system as carrier, collision and re-
action gasses, respectively. The system is ﬁtted with an
inert sample introduction kit that includes a PFA nebu-
lizer, spray chamber and torch connector, platinum sam-
pling and skimmer cones and a plasma torch with quartz
outer body and sapphire injector. This allows up to 20%
v/v acid concentration in the sample introduced to the
ICP-MS, including hydroﬂuoric acid (HF).

The limiting factor in realising reproducible high through-

including:

put ppt sensitivity is clean, standardised sample prepara-
tion requiring dedicated digestion apparatus and well de-
veloped procedures, including the use of ultra-pure acids
to avoid contamination of samples. The facility has the
sam-
relevant infrastructure to provide this,
ple preparation in separate ISO Class 5 laminar ﬂow unit
(LFU), sample digestion with the Milestone ETHOS–UP
closed vessel microwave digestion system with SK–15 high
pressure rotor, Milestone sub-boiling point acid distillation
(subCLEAN) and reﬂux cleaning (traceCLEAN) systems
and an ELGA PURELAB ﬂex ultra-pure de-ionised (DI)
water supply (18.2 MΩ.cm, < 5 parts-per-billion (ppb) to-
tal organic carbon). Finally, a Pyro–260 microwave ashing
system allows for the digestion of materials such as PTFE
that are resistant to most acids, including HF.

For most assays we follow material-by-material diges-
tion routines available for the ETHOS–UP and SK–15 high
pressure rotor. These specify the acid combinations and
microwave heating proﬁles needed to achieve complete di-
gestion. Where these do not exist, custom routines for
non-standard materials have been developed based on ex-
isting routines and in partnership with Milestone and U.K.
supplier Analytix Ltd. Typically nitric acid (HNO3) is
used to digest organic material, hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) for
decomposing silicates and metals such as Ti that are re-
sistant to oxidising acids, and hydrochloric acid (HCl) for
Fe-based alloys. When ﬁtted with the SK–15 high pres-
sure rotor the ETHOS–UP can simultaneously digest up
to 15 samples (with the same chemistry) each in their own
100 mL TFM vessels. TFM is a chemically modiﬁed form
of PTFE with excellent properties for trace analysis: high
chemical resistance, low-trace metal impurities, high melt-
ing point and an extremely smooth surface for decontam-
ination and cleaning.

2.1. Reagent purity

The purity of acids and other reagents used for diges-
tion, vessel-cleaning and preparation of calibration stan-
dards is critical for the limit of detection achievable when
assaying a material. For standard cleaning of vessels and
digestion of samples with ≫ ppb U/Th concentrations

2

we use ROMIL–SpATM Super Purity Acids (SpA). These
are cost eﬀective acids produced using sub-boiling point
distillation and are typically certiﬁed to < 0.1 ppb 238U
and 232Th per gram of reagent. For lower detection limits
and sub-ppb materials we use ROMIL-UpATM acids and
reagents which are produced through multiple re-distillation
and are typically certiﬁed to < 0.1 ppt 238U and 232Th.

Table 1 compares measured background equivalent con-
centrations (BEC) for nitric acid process blanks made with
ROMIL–SpA and ROMIL–UpA acids as well as for ROMIL–
SpA nitric acid that was subsequently twice-distilled using
the in-house subCLEAN distillation system. Inferred con-
centrations for undiluted HNO3 are consistent with the
manufacture’s stated typical concentrations: < 100 ppt
U/Th for SpA and < 0.1 ppt U/Th for UpA. We ﬁnd
that twice-distilled SpA is consistent with the UpA back-
ground concentration for 232Th and approaches that for
238U. Based on these results we now use twice-distilled
SpA–grade nitric for most digestions unless ultimate de-
tection limits are required. In addition, twice-distilled SpA
can be used in cleaning procedures requiring larger quan-
tities of reagents where UpA–grade acid is prohibitively
costly.

acid diluted to ∼ 20% v/v with DI water. Solutions were prepared
in 50 mL PP (polypropylene) vessels pre-leached in SpA nitric acid
for 24 hours. Equivalent concentrations for concentrated 69% nitric
acid are shown. These represent upper limits on the acid purity as
contributions from other sources, such as leaching from vessels, are
not subtracted.

2.2. Ar gas supply

In analysis mode the ICP-MS consumes up to 20 litres
per minute of argon gas, one 50 L 200 bar cylinder for every
8 hours of running1. Given the importance of Ar gas purity
for ultra-trace analysis and the potential costs associated
with the high-turnaround we have compared the perfor-
mance of the ICP-MS with two diﬀerent grades of bottled
gas: N5.0/zero-grade (min. 99.999%) and N5.5/research-
grade (min. 99.9995%), where the cost of research-grade is
signiﬁcantly higher, between 5 and 10 times that of zero-
grade from our supplier.

1A liquid argon supply was considered but was less cost eﬀective

due to wastage during periods of downtime.

Table 2 shows the 232Th and 238U BECs for a 5% v/v
HNO3 acid blank for both zero- and research-grade argon.
Two sets of acid blanks were prepared, a ﬁrst using uncon-
ditioned labware (virgin PP DigiTubes and 1 L Nalgene
containers) that was simply rinsed with DI water prior to
use and a second set where all labware was ﬁrst leached in
10% v/v SpA HNO3 for 24 hours prior to use. Switching
to blanks prepared using pre-conditioned labware halved
the BECs down to 7.1 ppq 232Th and 5.9 ppq 238U when
using research-grade argon. Zero-grade argon shows a few
ppq increase with respect to research-grade although re-
sults are almost within measurement errors.

Switching to zero-grade did not cause deterioration in
the CPS/ppt instrument response or the level of oxides
and doubly charged species during tuning;
in this case
(156CeO+/140Ce++) and (70Ce++/Ce+). Given this and
the sub-dominant blank rate increase we conclude zero-
grade argon is suﬃcient for most routine samples where
232Th and 238U are the analytes of interest.

(PP vials and DigiTubes) were leached in 10% ROMIL SpA HNO3
for 24 hours prior to use. For each run the instrument response based
on external calibrations were ∼ 300 CPS/ppt.

3. Procedures and analysis

With a focus on high-throughput and fast-turnaround
of time-critical assays, straightforward cleaning, sample
preparation and analysis procedures have been developed
for materials with U/Th concentrations in the 10 ppt to
1 ppb range: Samples are microwave-digested in pre-cleaned
TFM vessels using ultra-high purity acids. They are then
diluted, without further chemical treatment, into dispos-
able 50 mL polypropylene (PP) vessels ready for ICP-MS
analysis. Fractional recoveries of 230Th and 233U spikes
added prior to digestion are used to correct for 232Th and
238U signal loss from a range of sources.
In particular,
this enables accurate analysis of samples with high total
dissolved solids (TDS) where the instrument response de-
grades throughout the run. A full assay including diges-
tion, ICP-MS measurement and analysis can be completed
in a single day.

For a typical material three samples and three pro-
cess blanks are prepared2. Where possible, samples are

weighed directly into the 100 mL TFM vessel on an an-
alytical balance—located in the Class 5 LFU—for a dif-
ferential measurement. If this is not possible the average
of three separate measurements is taken before and after
addition of the sample. For a 0.1 g sample this results in
a systematic uncertainty of between 2-4%. If applicable,
230Th and 233U spike solution is then pipetted into the
vessel where the amount added is determined as a diﬀer-
ential measurement with a fractional error < 0.2%. The
digestion vessel is then transferred to the fume cupboard
where reagents are added.

Following digestion, the content of each vessel is de-
canted and rinsed into a 50 mL PP vessels (pre-weighed
and labeled) using DI water and diluted up to a total vol-
ume of 50 mL. The PP vessels are then weighed on the
analytical balance to determine overall dilution and sam-
If further dilution is needed to reach
ple concentration.
a sample concentration of 0.2%3 or because the sample is
expected to have a high (> few ppb U/Th content) then a
second stage of dilution into a new PP vessel is performed.
The samples are then ready to be poured into 6 mL PP
vials and loaded into the integrated auto-sampler.

The ICP-MS plasma auto-tune mode is chosen based
on the sample type:
for samples with high TDS (0.01-
0.2%) the General Purpose mode is used, whereas for low
TDS the Low Matrix mode is used. The ICP-MS is then
auto-tuned for high mass sensitivity using a tuning so-
lution containing Li, Y, Tl, Co and Ce in 2% HNO3.
The samples are then analysed in a single ICP-MS run:
for routine analysis we use a batch with external calibra-
tions, whereas for high precision measurements of sam-
ples with complex matrices we use the method of standard
additions to prepare calibrations in the sample matrix it-
self. To monitor instrument stability throughout the batch
∼ 1 ppb of 193Ir and 209Bi internal standards are added
into the sample line using a mixing tee; these are not used
for corrections. Masses (m/z ) 230, 232, 233 and 238 are
monitored in single point peak mode (a single channel per
mass at the mass peak) with the total integrated sample
time/mass chosen based on the expected signal size: for
measurements close to the detection limits greater than 20
seconds.

All data is exported from the MasssHunter software in
uncalibrated form: counts per second (CPS) plus instru-
ment relative standard deviation (RSD) for each sample
measurement and mass point. Calibration, blank rate sub-
traction, sample dilution and spike recovery corrections are
then applied oﬄine. The RSD errors are treated as gaus-
sian and combined with systematic errors associated with
the blank rate subtraction, dilution and spike-recovery cor-
rections.

3To ensure TDS are below the maximum recommended by the
manufacturer to avoid signiﬁcant matrix eﬀects and contamination
of sampler and skimmer cones.

3.1. Vessel cleaning and blank rates

Control of the analytical blank is key to achieving de-
tection limits low enough to assay materials for rare-event
searches. When using SpA-grade reagents for microwave
digestion the dominant contribution to the blank rate is
the purity of the reagent itself, yielding typically a few
ppt (g/g) of 232Th and 238U in the ﬁnal 20% solution and
limiting the detection limit to >ppb-levels in terms of sam-
ple concentration. For digestions with UpA-grade reagents
desorption of impurities in the TFM digestion vessels, PP
labware and the sample introduction system become im-
portant.

We apply two levels of cleaning for plastic labware such
as the PP 50 mL DigiTubes, 1 L High Density Polyethylene
(HDPE) bottes and 6 mL auto-sampler vials. Unlike the
TFM digestion vessels, they do not come into contact with
concentrated acids at elevated temperatures and we have
found that using new labware that has simply been rinsed
three times with DI water (and left to dry in the LFU if
being used for weighing) is suﬃcient for most purposes as
typical U/Th BECs seen in calibrations and samples pre-
pared are below < 30 ppq. For samples requiring lower
blank rates we leach all labware in 20, 10 or 5% v/v SpA
nitric acid for 24 hours prior to use, where the concentra-
tion is chosen to match the expected use. An example of
this was shown in Table 2, where we saw a halving of the
blank rate for 5% UpA blanks prepared in DigiTubes that
were ﬁrst leached in 10% SpA HNO3 for 24 hours.

As they hold concentrated reagents at elevated tem-
peratures contamination from the digestion vessels is of
particular concern. Following sample digestion each TFM
vessel and lid is rinsed a minimum of three times with DI
water and then, after drying, is put through a decontami-
nation microwave program. For routine cleaning this is a
15 minute ramp and 15 minute hold at 180◦C with 5 mL
of HNO3 SpA-grade and 5 mL of DI water. If a further
reduction in blank rate is required the process is repeated
with higher purity reagents, longer hold time or by match-
ing the reagents to those being used for the subsequent
digestion. For example, for the open vessel digestions of
Ti wire in §4.1 the vessel cleaning routine included an ad-
ditional 2 mL of hydroﬂuoric acid.

We now compare process blank rates for vessels pre-
cleaned using diﬀerent purity HNO3, ﬁrst with SpA-grade
and then with doubly-distilled SpA. Table 3 shows process
blank rates measured following closed vessel digestion of
10 mL of UpA-grade nitric acid on a typical microwave
routine (15 minute ramp and 20 minute hold at 210◦C).
There is a clear improvement when switching to doubly-
distilled SpA with the average blank rates coming down
to < 5 ppq for 232Th and < 10 ppq for 238U. More im-
portantly, the variability of the blank rate reduces signif-
icantly with standard deviations going from > 10 ppq to
< 3 ppq.

Taking 3× the standard deviation on the blank rates

in Table 3 as a guide to the achievable detection limits4
and accounting for a hypothetical 500-fold dilution (0.1 g
digested sample diluted to 50 mL ﬁnal solution) this im-
plies detection limits of around 20 ppt g/g for vessels pre-
cleaned with SpA HNO3 and below 5 ppt g/g when using
vessels cleaned with doubly-distilled-SpA.

Table 3: Comparison of process blank rates (in ppq g/g of 50 mL ﬁnal
diluted solution) for closed vessel microwave digestion with 10 mL
HNO3 (ROMIL UpA-grade) for 20 minutes at 210◦C. Blank rates
were measured twice for four vessels following the same microwave
cleaning procedure (20 minutes at 180◦C with 50% HNO3) but with
diﬀerent purity HNO3: once with SpA-grade HNO3 and once with
doubly-distilled SpA-grade HNO3. The large relative uncertainties
for the distilled-SpA pre-cleaned blanks indicates their proximity to
the instrument detection limits (∼10 ppq for this batch).

The reduced blank rates demonstrated with the double-
distilled SpA pre-cleaning are at or below instrument de-
tection limits when running the ICP-MS in a General Pur-
pose plasma mode with a standard tune for high-mass sen-
sitivity and stability. It is reported that with a custom tun-
ing the Agilent 7900 can achieve > 1000 CPS/ppt response
with instrument detection limits of 1.3 ppq with BEC of
0.48 ppq for a 238U calibration [6]. In these circumstances
further steps to reduce the process blank rate would be
motivated, such as using only ﬂuorinated polymers (FEP,
PFA) for all labware and the use the traceCLEAN acid
steam cleaning system.

3.2. 230Th and 233U spikes

Isotopic reference materials for 230Th and 233U were
purchased from the Institute for Reference Materials and
Measurements (IRMM)5 for use as spikes in isotopic dilu-
tion analysis. Each reference material was supplied in a
glass ampule containing 5 mL of chemically stable nitric
acid and was subsequently diluted using 5% v/v UpA ni-
tric acid into pre-conditioned6 FEP bottles to make ∼ 100

ing assayed and factors such as instrument stability, matrix eﬀects
and total integration time per mass.

mL stock solutions. These stock solutions are then further
diluted as needed to make ∼ppb g/g working solutions
from which the 1–100 ppt typical spike and calibration
solutions are made up.

Tables 4 and 5 show calculated concentrations for the
stock, working and a ﬁnal spike solution based on certiﬁed
values for the 230Th (IRMM–061 [7]) and 233U (IRMM–
051 [8]) spikes, respectively. To conﬁrm the isotope ratios
as well as the overall dilution scale the spike solutions were
measured using an ICP-MS run with external calibrations
(matrix matched) and show good agreement for all iso-
topes.

The low spike ratios of n(232Th)/n(230Th) < 0.2%
and n(238U)/n(233U) < 1% and the proximity of typical
low-background materials to instrument detection limits
means that for many materials full isotope dilution analy-
sis to determine 232Th and 238U reduces to a simple spike
recovery correction.

3.3. 232Th and 238U recovery for IAEA–385 Irish Sea Sed-

iment CRM

To verify 232Th and 238U recovery in a realistic sample
matrix four samples of reference material IAEA–385 [9]
were processed for comparison to certiﬁed values. IAEA–
385 is a powder made from sediment collected from the
Irish Sea in 1995 which was ground, sieved and homoge-
nized and then certiﬁed for a range of radionuclides. Con-
sisting mainly of Si (160 mg/g), Ca (55 mg/g), Al (45
mg/g), Fe (31 mg/g) and K (18 mg/g), it represents a com-
plex matrix requiring multi-acid digestion. The certiﬁed
values of 33.7 Bq/kg 232Th and 29.0 Bq/kg 238U translate
to concentrations of 8.3 ppm and 2.3 ppm respectively.

Samples were digested using the ETHOS–UP microwave
following a method developed for soil samples with Ana-
lytix. Up to 0.2 g of sample was weighed into each TFM
vessel and then 8 mL HNO3 (ROMIL SpA) + 2 mL HF
(Fisher TraceMetal) + 2 mL H2O2 (Merck Suprapur) was
added. The vessels were left for 10 minutes before running
through a modiﬁed ETHOS–UP Sea Sediment method
(SK–Environmental–026): 15 minute ramp to 200◦C, then
hold for 20 minutes, then fan cool for 40 minutes. Follow-
ing digestion the vessel contents were decanted into 50
mL DigiTubes and diluted up to a total volume of 50 mL
using deionized water, a dilution of around 250. The di-
gested solution was a clear light green/blue liquid. Due
to the high >ppm levels of contamination expected a fur-
ther factor 100 dilution was performed to bring ﬁnal solu-
tion concentrations down to O(100 ppt) to avoid potential
contamination of the sample introduction system and ICP-
MS itself. In addition to the four IAEA-385 samples three
process blanks were prepared. Samples were not spiked
with 230Th and 233U as this would have required a signif-
icant quantity of each stock solution, with an associated
potential for contamination, to be added to each vessel
to yield comparable concentrations to those expected for
232Th and 238U.

Twice diluted samples and process blanks were pro-
cessed in a single batch with the Agilent 7900 running in
General Purpose plasma mode and auto-tuned for high-
mass sensitivity. 20, 75, 150 and 300 ppt external cali-
brations were used yielding instrument sensitivities of 350

each sample are shown as well as their average and stan-
dard deviation. The equivalent Bq/kg speciﬁc activity can
be compared to the IAEA certiﬁed values (95% conﬁdence

ciﬁc activity is within 2% of the certiﬁed value whereas for
232Th there is a ∼20% deﬁcit indicating a partial recovery.

The partial recovery of 232Th could be due to a number
of factors such as the formation of insoluble ﬂouride species
formed by the reaction of Th and hydroﬂuoric acid or the
over-dilution of the digested samples such that 232Th is
no longer stable in the solution. Further measurements
with a boric acid (H3BO3) complexation step and with
judiciously chosen 230Th and 233U spikes would likely re-
solve the source of partial recovery. For now an additional
20% systematic uncertainty is assumed for 232Th measure-
ments.

4. Results for typical low-background materials

To illustrate both a high-sensitivity assay using open
digestion and a more routine material requiring closed-
vessel digestion in a multi-acid mixture we present results
for two low-background materials that were assayed as
part of the LZ materials screening campaign: an open ves-
sel digestion of small drilling burrs taken from a slab of
ultra-low background Ti and a closed-vessel digestion of a
nickel-chromium-alloy wire.

4.1. Open digestion: ultra-pure Ti chips

TIMET HN3469 is a single 15,000 kg slab of ultra-
radiopure ASTM Grade 1 titanium procured to make the
LZ cryostat following an extensive radio-assay campaign [10].
A sample of ∼ 2 g of burrs drilled from a test coupon,
taken from the middle of TIMET HN3469, were provided
for rapid ICP-MS analysis for the purposes of quality con-
trol. For this coupon the inferred values of 238U and
232Th as determined through gamma-spectroscopy mea-
surements with high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors
were 238U = 2.8 ± 0.15 mBq/kg and 232Th < 0.2 mBq/kg.
The small sample mass, low activity and fast turnaround
makes this a canonical use-case for ICP-MS.

Prior to digestion samples were sonicated twice in high-
purity IPA (Fisher Chemical Optima grade > 99.9%),
rinsed in DI water and then etched in a 2% v/v HF and
2% v/v HNO3 solution. The etching process consumed
around 30% of the mass, after which samples were rinsed
in DI water and left to dry overnight in the ISO Class 5
LFU. At each stage a small amount of the sample was set
aside to gauge the eﬀectiveness of each step. Four samples
with masses between 0.1 and 0.2 g were prepared for di-
gestion: samples #1 and #2 had been both cleaned and
etched, sample #3 was only cleaned and sample #4 was
neither cleaned nor etched.

Samples were weighed into open TFM vessels (pre-
cleaned in the ETHOS-UP with SpA-grade HNO3) and
spiked with ∼ 1.5 mL of 50 ppt 230Th and 233U solu-
tion, to give ∼ 0.75 ppt in diluted samples. In addition to
the sample vessels three process blanks were prepared and
spiked. To digest, 10 mL of a ∼10% v/v HF and ∼10%
v/v HNO3 mixture was added to each vessel. The ves-
sels were left for an hour (visually, samples were dissolved
within 5 minutes) prior to a two-stage dilution with DI

water to bring the total sample concentration to below
0.2%, the maximum recommended TDS for the ICP-MS.
For both etching and digestion only ROMIL UpA-grade
HF and doubly-distilled SpA HNO3 were used.

All diluted samples and blanks were processed in a sin-
gle ICP-MS batch in General Purpose plasma mode and
auto-tuned to high-mass sensitivity. External calibrations
of 0.05, 0.25, 1.0 and 5.0 ppt established instrument sen-
sitivities of 72 CPS/ppt 230Th, 71 CPS/ppt 232Th, 77
CPS/ppt 233U and 77 CPS/ppt 238U. The low CPS/ppt
responses were due to buildup on the sampling cone fol-
lowing earlier runs with high TDS.

Results are shown in Table 7 where the Ti sample or-
dering corresponds to their order in the batch run. Process
blank rates were below the instrument detection limits and
show full spike recovery for both 230Th and 232Th. Spike
recovery drops signiﬁcantly throughout the run, consistent
with the response from the 193Ir and 209Bi internal stan-
dards. Results for ppt g/g of Ti are corrected for spike
recovery and sample mass/dilution on a sample-by-sample
basis. All measurements were consistent with results from
HPGe assays with the exception of 232Th in sample #4,
which showed an elevated activity consistent with the in-
troduction of surface contamination during processing and
handling. The uncertainties on these measurements were
not process blank rate limited and it is expected that with
a more typical instrument sensitivity (∼ 400 CPS/ppt,
achievable after cleaning) measurements down to 10 ppt
g/g of can be achieved.

4.2. Closed vessel microwave digestion: Ni-based alloy

A 10 g piece of nickel-chromium-alloy (Inconel) wire
sample was made available for assay. Before digestion the
wire was cleaned using IPA-cleanroom wipes, rinsed with
DI water and left to dry overnight in the LFU. Three small
∼0.1 g sections of Inconel were cut7 and weighed directly
into the digestion vessels and two process blanks were pre-
pared. One sample (#1) and one process blank were spiked
with 1.5 mL of 50 ppt 230Th and 233U solution, to give
∼ 1.5 ppt in the diluted solution.

Samples were digested in 6 mL HCl + 3 mL HNO3
+ 1 mL HF (all ROMIL UpA-grade) using closed vessel
microwave digestion following the ETHOS-UP SK–Metal–
018 Inconel routine: 20 minute ramp to 220◦C and then 15
minute hold at 220◦C. Following digestion, samples were
decanted into 50 mL PP DigiTubes and diluted down to
< 0.2% concentration by topping up to 50 mL with DI
water.

Samples were processed in a single ICP-MS batch with
the instrument in General Purpose plasma mode and auto-
tuned for high-mass sensitivity. External calibrations of
0.2, 1.0 and 20.0 ppt established instrument sensitivities
of 238 CPS/ppt 230Th, 238 CPS/ppt 232Th, 272 CPS/ppt

Table 7: ICP-MS analysis of TIMET HN3469–M Ti chips provided by the LZ collaboration. Samples were digested in open TFM vessels using
8 mL DI water + 1 mL HF + 1 mL HNO3 (both ROMIL UpA-grade). 232Th and 238U ppt values are per gram of sample mass and include
process blank and spike recovery corrections. Ti samples #1 and #2 were cleaned and etched prior to digestion, sample #3 was cleaned but
not etched and sample #4 was neither cleaned or etched. External calibrations established the instrument response at the start of the run to
be 71 CPS/ppt 232Th and 77 CPS/ppt 238U. Throughout the ICP-MS run this response degraded due to buildup on sampling and interface
cones. Per sample spike recovery was used to correct the external calibrations for this time dependence plus any matrix or digestion eﬃciency
eﬀects.

233U and 272 CPS/ppt 238U. Results are shown in Ta-
ble 8. Measured ppb g/g of Ni-Cr-alloy concentrations
include a sub-dominant average process blank subtraction
and are corrected for the spike recovery in sample #1.
Errors on individual sample measurements include the in-
strument statistical error, uncertainty in the process blank
and the error associated with weighing the ∼ 1 g sam-
ples. The use of a single spike correction results in an
additional 10% systematic error giving ﬁnal speciﬁc activ-
ities for 232Th of 4.0 ± 0.1(meas.)± 0.4(syst.) mBq/kg, and
110.9±2.1(meas.)±11.1(syst.) mBq/kg for 238U. This mea-
surement demonstrates the precision that can be achieved
for samples with relatively high activities. The additional
systematic would be eliminated by the use of appropriate
quantities of spikes in all samples.

5. Summary and Outlook

The UCL ICP-MS rare-event search laboratory serves
as a dedicated materials screening facility for the LZ dark
matter experiment. The primary instrument is an Agi-
lent 7900 ICP-MS with an instrument sensitivity down to
∼ 10 ppq U/Th and ﬁtted with an inert sample intro-
duction kit to allow direct sampling of solutions with up
to 20% acid concentrations, including HF. The ICP-MS
is operated inside an ISO Class 6 cleanroom alongside all
necessary infrastructure for sample preparation.

Straightforward cleaning, sample preparation and anal-
ysis procedures have been developed to allow high-throughput
and fast-turnaround of materials with U/Th concentra-
tions down to 10 ppt g/g of sample. These are based on
microwave assisted sample digestion in pre-cleaned TFM
vessels and then direct ICP-MS measurement of the di-
luted sample with no further chemical treatment or evap-
oration steps. We use 230Th and 233U spikes to correct
for signal loss from a range of sources, and demonstrate
the importance of their use through digestion and assay of
a complex sea sediment CRM. These procedures allow a
complete assay, including digestion, ICP-MS measurement
and analysis, to be completed in a single day.

We have evaluated the impact of reagent purity on
U/Th background levels and found that for most routine
assays it is possible to use doubly-distilled ROMIL-SpA
nitric acid as an almost equivalent and cheap alternative
to ultra-pure ROMIL-UpA grade acid. In addition, it was
shown that switching ICP-MS Ar carrier gas purity from
research-grade (N5.5) to zero-grade (N5.0) causes no sig-
niﬁcant increase in U/Th background level given current
instrument sensitivity and labware cleaning protocols.

Results were presented for two typical low-background
materials assayed as part of the LZ materials screening
campaign: an open digestion of ultra-pure Ti demonstrat-
ing a ∼ 30 ppt g/g 232Th measurement and showing consis-
tency with HPGe results for both Th and U; and a closed
vessel digestion of a nickel-chromium-alloy wire requiring
a multi-acid mixture as an example of a high-precision
measurement of a ppb-level sample. These demonstrate
the suitability of the procedures to screen the majority of
materials for the current generation low-background ex-
periments. Over 100 assays have been performed for LZ
with this facility already as part of the experiment’s con-
struction phase. Results from these measurements will be
presented by the collaboration in the future.

Looking ahead, future low-background experiments, such

as so-called ‘Generation-3’ dark matter, and next gener-
ation 0νββ searches will require backgrounds and conse-
quent radio-assay capability at least an order of magnitude
better than present searches. ICP-MS, with both requisite
sensitivity to direct 232Th and 238U measurements and
high throughput, will be a key technique, complementing
gamma-spectroscopy, radon emanation, and material sur-
face activity measurements in the radio-assay campaigns
of all such future experiments. Moreover, sensitivity can
be enhanced further. Improved cleanliness procedures and
matrix separation techniques, see for example [11], can be
applied to concentrate U/Th and boost 232Th and 238U
signal to sub-ppt sensitivity.

to 220◦C and then 15 minute hold at 220◦C. 232Th and 238U ppb values are per gram of sample mass and include process blank and spike
recovery corrections (using sample #1). There is an additional 10% systematic associated with the spike-correction. Results are consistent
across the three samples assayed.
