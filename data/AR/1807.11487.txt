Abstract: We present a procedure to calculate the Sudakov radiator for a generic recursive
infrared and collinear (rIRC) safe observable in two-scale problems. We give closed formulae for
the radiator at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, which completes the general
NNLL resummation for this class of observables in the ARES method for processes with two emitters
at the Born level. As a byproduct, we deﬁne a physical coupling in the soft limit, and we provide
an explicit expression for its relation to the MS coupling up to O(α3
s). This physical coupling con-
stitutes one of the ingredients for a NNLL accurate parton shower algorithm. As an application we
obtain analytic NNLL results, of which several are new, for all angularities τx deﬁned with respect
to both the thrust axis and the winner-take-all axis, and for the moments of energy-energy corre-
lation F Cx in e+e− annihilation. For the latter observables we ﬁnd that, for some values of x, an
accurate prediction of the peak of the diﬀerential distribution requires a simultaneous resummation
of the logarithmic terms originating from the two-jet limit and at the Sudakov shoulder.

Introduction

Distributions in event shapes and jet resolution parameters, collectively jet observables, are among
the most studied QCD observables. Since they are continuous measures of the hadronic energy-
momentum ﬂow in jet events at colliders, they constitute a powerful probe of the dynamics of strong
interactions, from high scales where ﬁxed-order perturbative calculations can be applied, down to
low scales where the yet unexplained phenomenon of hadronisation plays a decisive role.

Jet observables play a major role in measurements of the QCD coupling αs, and in testing
non-perturbative hadronisation models (see e.g. Ref. [1] and references therein). The study of jet
observables also led to important advances in the understanding of all-order properties of QCD
radiation, which lead to the discovery of the so-called non-global logarithms [2–4]. Distributions in
jet observables can be computed at ﬁxed order in QCD perturbation theory. Such calculations have
reached next-to-next-leading order (NNLO) accuracy for a number of relevant QCD processes. In
particular, for e+e− annihilation, NNLO corrections to three-jet production have been computed
in refs. [5–9].

While ﬁxed-order calculations provide a reliable tool to describe jet observables in the region
where their values are large, the bulk of data lies in a region where multiple soft-collinear emis-
sions give rise to large logarithms of the jet observable at all orders in perturbation theory. To be
precise, given a generic jet observable, let us consider its cumulative distribution Σ(v), the frac-
tion of events such that the observable’s value is less than v. This quantity exhibits logarithmic

– 1 –

terms as large as αn
s L2n, where L = − ln v and n is the order in QCD perturbation theory. Re-
summing those large logarithms means reorganising ln Σ in such a way that it can be written as
αsg1(αsL) + g2(αsL) + αsg3(αsL) + . . . , where g1(αsL) resums the so-called leading logarithmic
s Ln−1, and
(LL) contributions, αn
so on.

s Ln+1, g2(αsL) the NLL ones, αn

s Ln, g3(αsL) the NNLL ones, αn

Next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) resummations, that include all terms O(αn

s Ln) in the loga-
rithm of cumulative distributions, have been available for many years for speciﬁc observables [10–16].
Nowadays, NLL resummation for jet observables that have the properties of recursive infrared and
collinear (rIRC) safety and continuous globalness [18, 19] is a solved problem. The general solution
is based on a semi-numerical approach developed for e+e− event-shapes and jet rates in Ref. [20],
and later extended to any suitable jet observable in any QCD hard process [18, 19]. The method
is implemented in the computer program CAESAR [18], that also veriﬁes whether a given observ-
able is rIRC safe and continuously global. This led to a ﬁrst systematic study of event shapes
in hadronic dijet production at NLL accuracy matched to next-to-leading order (NLO) results at
hadron colliders [21, 22].

NLL predictions have a sizeable theoretical uncertainty. Given the precision of current experi-
ments, theoretical accuracy for resummations should aim at NNLL, and in some cases beyond. Most
NNLL resummations are observable speciﬁc, and rely on the properties of the observable to achieve
resummation through factorisation theorems that separate diﬀerent kinematical conﬁgurations (e.g.
hard, soft, collinear), and appropriate renormalisation group equations based on the fact that phys-
ical distributions do not depend on the unphysical scales that need to be introduced to achieve
such separation. Such approaches made it possible to obtain full next-to-next-to-leading logarith-
mic (NNLL) predictions for a number of global e+e− event shapes such as thrust 1 − T [23–25],
heavy jet mass ρH [26], jet broadenings BT , BW [27], C-parameter [28], energy-energy correlation
(EEC) [29–31], heavy hemisphere groomed mass [32], and angularities [33]. Among the above ex-
amples, for 1 − T , ρH , C-parameter, and EEC, all N3LL corrections are also known, except for the
four-loop cusp anomalous dimension, that has been computed numerically more recently [34]. Jet
observables have been resummed at NNLL accuracy also in deep inelastic scattering [35–37]. For
hadronic collisions, full NNLL resummations are available for processes where a colour singlet is
produced at Born level, speciﬁcally for a boson’s transverse momentum [38, 39] and φ∗ [40], the
beam thrust [41, 42], transverse thrust [43], and the leading jet’s transverse momentum [44–47],
and for heavy quark pair’s transverse momentum [48, 49]. For an arbitrary number of legs, a NNLL
accurate resummation is available for the N -jettiness variable [50]. Very recently, resummations for
the boson’s transverse momenta and φ∗ have been pushed to N3LL accuracy [51–53].

Despite these remarkable results, most jet observables are beyond the scope of factorisation
theorems. This is especially true for those observables which cannot be expressed in terms of sim-
ple analytic functions of momenta, e.g. event shapes like the thrust major, or the two-jet rate in
the Durham algorithm. For rIRC safe observables, it is possible to achieve NNLL accuracy by
means of the semi-numerical method ARES (Automated Resummer for Event Shapes), developed
for e+e− event shapes in Ref. [54], and later extended to jet rates [55]. These publications focused
on NNLL corrections induced by resolved real radiation. There, the cancellation of infrared sin-
gularities between unresolved real and virtual corrections to the Born process was parametrised in
an observable dependent Sudakov form factor called “radiator”, that was extracted from existing
calculations. This made it possible to study only observables that scale like powers of the transverse
momentum or the invariant mass of the jet, which constitute a vast set of the phenomenologically
relevant observables. This led to the ﬁrst resummations for complicated observables such as the
thrust major and the two-jet rate with various jet algorithms in e+e− [54, 55].

In this paper we complete the last analytic ingredient necessary to have a fully general formula
for the resummation of rIRC safe jet observables at NNLL in processes with two hard legs at the

– 2 –

Born level. This makes it possible to handle all known observables of this type in a single framework,
and hence paves the way to systematic phenomenological applications. We formulate the Sudakov
radiator at all orders for a generic rIRC jet observable in QCD, and we explicitly compute it at
NNLL accuracy. Our calculation of the Sudakov radiator must be then supplemented with the
ﬁnite contributions coming from real radiation that are computed as in refs. [54, 55].

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we give the formulation of a general procedure for
the resummation of jet observables with the ARES formalism. There we deﬁne the main object of our
paper, the Sudakov radiator, which we compute at NNLL accuracy in section 3. The computation
of the radiator leads to a deﬁnition of the physical coupling for soft radiation at higher orders. This
generalises the scheme of Ref. [61], and constitutes an ingredient for future NNLL accurate parton
shower algorithms. In that same section, we present a new formulation of the NNLL correction
δFcorrel introduced in Ref. [54], that we redeﬁned in order to make sure that the Sudakov radiator
can be computed analytically for an arbitrary rIRC safe jet observable. In section 4, we apply our
method to angularities and moments of energy-energy correlation in e+e− annihilation, and outline
brieﬂy the main features of their phenomenology at present and future colliders. Section 5 contains
our conclusions.

2 Resummation in the ARES formalism

In this section we summarise the structure of the NNLL resummed cross section for a generic rIRC
observable in e+e− annihilation. We ﬁrst set up the relevant notation and kinematics, and then we
move on to derive the resummed cross section up to NNLL accuracy.

2.1 Kinematics and notation

Let V ({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) be a generic continuously global, rIRC safe ﬁnal-state observable, a function
of all ﬁnal-state momenta.1 Here {˜p} denotes {˜p1, ˜p2}, which are the quark-antiquark pair initiating
the process after all radiation has been emitted, and k1, . . . , kn are the momenta of the additional
radiation. At Born level V ({˜p}) = 0.
In order to parametrise the radiation momenta ki, we
introduce the following Sudakov decomposition

i = z(1)

where pµ
i is a space-like four-vector and its magnitude
is denoted by kti ≡ (cid:112)−κ2
i z(2)
i = 0 implies that z(1)

choice of the reference momenta p1 and p2 is arbitrary, and determines the mapping between
the Sudakov variables {z(1)
, κi} and the actual ﬁnal-state momenta {˜p1, ˜p2, k1, . . . , kn}. A
particular choice is therefore motivated by computational convenience. In our case, we observe that
the product of the squared amplitude and phase space for an emission k collinear to either ˜p1 or ˜p2
is proportional to

1The actual inputs of ﬁnal-state observables are hadron momenta. However, it is well known that using parton
momenta gives distributions that diﬀer from the measured ones by corrections suppressed by powers of the typical
hard scale of the process, in this case the centre-of-mass energy of the e+e− collision.

– 3 –

up to corrections that vanish as a power of kt in the limit kt → 0. One possible solution, adopted
in Ref. [18], is to choose the two reference vectors p1 and p2 in Eq. (2.1) to be the momenta of
the emitter of parton ki and the corresponding spectator. The precise deﬁnition of emitter and
spectator requires specifying an ordering of insertion of the emissions in the event. A natural way
of reconstructing the kinematics is to insert the emissions as follows:

• Start with the two-parton event consisting of the initial q ¯q pair, without any additional

emissions. These momenta deﬁne the initial p1 and p2 vectors.

• Consider a set of emissions parametrised by the triplet {z(1)

, κi}. At this stage the
kinematics is not uniquely determined, as we did not specify the reference vectors of Eq. (2.1).

• Associate emissions for which z(1)

(2.5)

• For each leg (cid:96), insert the emissions into the initial event starting from the one at smaller
η((cid:96)). The reference momentum p(cid:96) in Eq. (2.1) represents the emitter and takes the transverse
recoil. The longitudinal recoil is shared between the emitter and a spectator momentum
(i.e. the remaining reference vector in Eq. (2.1)). However, for the purpose of the analytical
method presented in this paper, one can safely neglect the longitudinal recoil of the spectator
(which is proportional to k2
ti) that would otherwise give rise to regular terms in the cross
section. For instance, for an emission k emitted oﬀ leg 1, and parametrised by Eq. (2.1), we
have

1 → (1 − z(1))pµ
pµ

1 − κµ ,

2 → pµ
pµ
2 .

(2.6)

The resulting momenta p1 and p2, after the emission, will be massless up to O(k2

ti) corrections.

• Update the reference momenta, and proceed with the insertion of emissions at progressively

larger η((cid:96))

i

.

This procedure guarantees the validity of Eq. (2.3), and implies that the reference vectors p1 and
p2 are diﬀerent for each emission [54].

Before proceeding, we stress that the ordering chosen for the insertion of the emissions in the
event has nothing to with the way the triplets {z(1)
, κi} are produced. For instance, when
computing the resummation via a Monte Carlo algorithm, it is convenient to generate this triplet
according to an ordering in the observable’s value (see, e.g. [18, 54]). This ordering is however
unrelated to the ordering with which the emissions are inserted, which follows the angular ordering
arguments outlined above. This is essential to specify a correct recoil scheme that preserves the
simple factorised form of QCD matrix elements.

2.2 General structure of NNLL resummation

Any rIRC safe observable V ({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn), can be parametrised in the following way for a single
soft and collinear emission k collinear to each leg (cid:96)

V ({˜p}, k) (cid:39) Vsc(k) ≡

t

Here k((cid:96))
, η((cid:96)), φ((cid:96)) are the transverse momentum, rapidity and azimuth of k with respect to the
emitter p(cid:96) as deﬁned in the previous section, whereas a, b(cid:96), d(cid:96) are constants.2 The scale Q represents
a typical hard scale of the process, in our case the centre-of-mass energy of the e+e− collision.

Our aim is to resum large logarithms in the cumulative distribution Σ(v), the fraction of events

for which V ({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) < v, in the region v (cid:28) 1. This is given by

Σ(v) ≡

(2.8)

where H(Q) includes all virtual corrections to the Born process (normalised to the total cross
section σ) and M2(k1, ..., kn) is the amplitude squared for n real emissions. The Lorentz-invariant
phase-space in d = 4 − 2(cid:15) dimensions is denoted by [dk] and deﬁned as

[dk] ≡

ddk
(2π)d−1 δ(k2)Θ(k0).

(2.9)

Given the Sudakov decomposition of any four-momentum k of (squared) invariant mass k2 = m2
as in Eq. (2.1), the measure ddk can be expressed as

ddk = (p1p2)dz(1)dz(2)d2−2(cid:15)kt =

y ≡

(cid:18) z(1)
z(2)

(cid:19)

(2.10)

The variable y is the rapidity of k (with respect to some reference light-like directions p1 and p2),
and for real emissions, i.e. k2 = 0, it is bounded by3
(cid:18) Q
kt

|y| < ln

(2.11)

(cid:19)

.

It is immediate to link y to the rapidity of a massless emission k with respect to a given leg (cid:96). In
fact, η(1) = y for y > 0, and η(2) = −y for y < 0. This implies that the phase space [dk] in Eq. (2.9)
can be written as follows

[dk] =

(2.12)

So far, all momenta have to be considered in d-dimensions, because dimensional regularisation is
needed to regulate the IRC divergences present both in H(Q) and in the real radiation.

The virtual corrections H(Q) can be expressed as [56, 57]

(2.13)

The virtual corrections are parametrised in three objects. First, w(m2, k2
t + m2; (cid:15)) denotes the soft
web [58, 59] of total momentum k and squared invariant mass m2, in d = 4 − 2(cid:15) dimensions. The
web is obtained by considering the Feynman graphs with two eikonal lines that cannot be further
decomposed into subgraphs by cutting each eikonal line once. For example, at lowest order in
perturbation theory we ﬁnd

w(1)(m2, m2 + k2

t ; (cid:15)) = (4π)2 2C(cid:96)
k2
t

R αs(µR)δ(m2) ,
µ2(cid:15)

(2.14)

2IRC safety implies a > 0 and b(cid:96) > −a. While b(cid:96), d(cid:96) and g(cid:96) can be diﬀerent for each leg, continuous globalness

implies a has to be the same for all legs.

3Strictly, one should use (cid:112)2(p1p2) instead of the centre-of-mass energy of the e+e− collision Q. However, for the

emissions of relevance in this paper, the two scales coincide, up to corrections that vanish as a power of kt.

– 5 –

where C(cid:96) = CF in the case of quarks, and C(cid:96) = CA in the case of emitting gluons. Note that the
web does not depend on the rapidity y, due to the properties of eikonal Feynman rules. Remarkably,
at each order in perturbation theory, the web has a ﬁnite limit for (cid:15) → 0, which we will simply
denote by w(m2, m2 + k2
t ). Second, the function γ(cid:96)(αs(k, (cid:15))) coincides, up to an overall sign change,
with the coeﬃcient of the δ(1 − x) term of the regularised splitting functions Pqq(x) and Pgg(x),
according to whether leg (cid:96) is a quark or a gluon, respectively. The strong coupling αs(k, (cid:15)) is deﬁned
as the solution of the d-dimensional renormalisation group equation:

where β(d=4) is the beta function in four dimensions, given by the following expansion

β(d=4)(αs) = −α2

s .

(2.15)

(2.16)

In our representation of H(Q), the upper integration bound for the kt-integral of the web is set by the
centre-of-mass energy Q, and the upper bound for the rapidity integral to |y| < ln(Q/(cid:112)k2
t + m2).
Finally, the overall quantity C(αs(Q)) is a multiplicative constant that is obtained by matching
Eq. (2.13) at each order in perturbation theory to the quark or gluon form factor computed in the
MS scheme.

In order to proceed, we need to deﬁne a procedure to cancel the IRC singularities in Eq. (2.13)
against those in the real emissions. This can be done by introducing a resolution parameter that
is engineered in such a way to divide the real radiation into a resolved set and an unresolved
one. The idea behind this procedure is to handle the unresolved part of the radiation analytically,
and hence cancel the divergences against the virtual corrections. The cancellation is performed
in a manner that the resolved contributions could subsequently be computed numerically in d = 4
dimensions. The resolution parameter is deﬁned through its action on the soft and/or hard-collinear
contributions to the squared amplitudes, as outlined below.

We start by considering soft radiation. The soft squared amplitudes for n emissions, denoted

hereafter as M 2

s (k1, . . . , kn), can be iteratively reorganised as follows
s (k1) ≡ ˜M 2
M 2
s (k1, k2) = ˜M 2
M 2
s (k1, k2, k3) = ˜M 2

s (k1)

The quantities ˜M 2
s (k1, . . . , kn) represent the correlated portion of the n-emission soft amplitude
squared, together with its virtual corrections.4 This is strongly suppressed unless all emissions
k1, . . . , kn are close in angle. We refer to the latter as soft correlated blocks and they play a
dominant role in constructing the webs, which are the building objects of the Sudakov radiator
to be deﬁned below. Each correlated block admits a perturbative expansion in αs due to virtual
corrections, hence

The tree-level correlated block with two emissions ˜M 2
s,0(k1, k2) is reported in Appendix A, and will
be useful later. This decomposition is particularly convenient to deﬁne a logarithmic counting.

s (k1, . . . , kn) will contribute to ln Σ(v) at most with a factor αn

The deﬁnition of the resolution parameter proceeds as follows. First, we deﬁne a clustering

The property of rIRC safety [18] implies that all particles in a cluster are both close in angle and
have commensurate transverse momenta. This allows one to evaluate the QCD running couplings of
each cluster at the transverse momenta of the corresponding emissions. This procedure allows us to
absorb all logarithms of µR/kti into the running of the coupling. As a consequence of this procedure,
for rIRC safe observables, using the decomposition (2.17), every correlated block ˜M 2
s (k1, . . . , kn)
(when combined with the corresponding virtual corrections) will contribute to ln Σ(v) with terms of
s lnm+2−n(v) for m ≥ n. This allows us to build a logarithmic counting at the level of the
order αm
squared amplitude, which deﬁnes which contributions must be considered at a given logarithmic
order.

In order to proceed with the calculation of Σ(v), we then choose a resolution parameter δ (cid:28) 1

such that all clusters of total momentum kclust. satisfying

Vsc(kclust.) < δv ,

(2.24)

are labelled as unresolved. This choice guarantees that one is able to compute analytically the
contribution of unresolved emissions for an arbitrary rIRC safe observable. For this class of ob-
servables, the unresolved clusters can be neglected from the Θ function in Eq. (2.8) since they do
not contribute to the observable V up to corrections suppressed by powers of δpv, with p being a
positive parameter.

The above deﬁnition of the resolution parameter allows us to exponentiate the contribution of
unresolved soft blocks. From the decomposition of Eq. (2.17), it is straightforward to connect the
correlated blocks ˜M 2
s (k1, . . . , kn) to the webs introduced in Eq. (2.13). In fact

where the factor S(n) represents the multiplicity coeﬃcient for each soft ﬁnal state (quarks or glu-
ons). For instance, for n identical gluons, S(n) = 1/n!. Therefore, the contribution of an arbitrary

and we took the four-dimensional limit of the web (and the relative integration measure) since the
integral is now ﬁnite.

The next step is to handle the remaining hard-collinear divergences present in the integral
over γ in Eq. (2.27). Unlike the case of soft radiation, the exponentiation of the unresolved hard-
collinear emissions is more delicate in that every hard-collinear emission could potentially change
the colour charge felt by subsequent radiation. However, the treatment of hard-collinear radiation
is much simpliﬁed by observing that, owing to rIRC safety, only a ﬁxed number of hard-collinear
emissions is to be considered at a given logarithmic order. Therefore, instead of proceeding as in
the soft case, it is convenient to start from the integral over the anomalous dimension γ in the
virtual corrections (2.27) and split it into two pieces at the collinear scale of the resolution variable,
that is found by setting the rapidity η((cid:96)) to its maximum (i.e. ln(Q/kt)) in Eq. (2.7), which yields
Vsc(k) ∼ ka+b(cid:96)
Inspired by this, the integral over γ then can be split at k = v1/(a+b(cid:96))Q and
becomes

The ﬁrst non-trivial order in the expansion must be included at NNLL, the second at N3LL (together
with the squared of the ﬁrst), and so forth. The divergences of these terms will cancel order-by-order
in perturbation theory against those of the hard-collinear emissions in the real radiation.

The last step to obtain a NNLL expression for Σ(v) is to handle the squared matrix element
for real emissions M2 in Eq. (2.8). At NLL accuracy, rIRC safety ensures that resolved radiation

contains no hard-collinear emissions, and the real matrix element squared is approximated by its
soft approximation M 2

particular, at NNLL, it is suﬃcient to allow one single emission to be hard and collinear. When
combined with Eq. (2.30), this leads to a ﬁnite, logarithmically enhanced, left over, as it will be
shown shortly. In such conﬁgurations, at NNLL, the remaining soft radiation consists of an arbitrary
number of single-emission clusters.

With the above decomposition, the NNLL resummed cross section Σ(v) of Eq. (2.8) takes the

where the functions FNLL and δFNNLL have a general expression for any rIRC safe observable [18,
54, 55] and can be eﬃciently evaluated numerically in d = 4 dimensions. The NNLL function is
decomposed as follows

δFNNLL = δFsc + δFhc + δFrec + δFwa + δFcorrel + δFclust ,

(2.46)

where each term has a well-deﬁned physical origin.

– 11 –

• The corrections δFsc, δFwa, δFcorrel and δFclust have soft origin and they all originate from

the ﬁrst term in the curly brackets of Eq. (2.39).

The function δFsc accounts for running coupling corrections to the real emissions in the CMW
scheme [61] as well as for the correct rapidity boundary for a single soft-collinear emission.
For event shapes variables this correction is particularly simple [54] owing to the fact that the
rapidity dependence of the observable can be always handled analytically. For observables
with a more complicated rapidity dependence, such as jet rates [55], the running coupling
correction and the correction due to the rapidity boundary must be treated separately.

The function δFwa accounts for the diﬀerence between the observable and its soft-collinear
parametrisation for a single soft-non-collinear (wide-angle) emission accompanied by many
soft-collinear gluons.

At NLL all resolved emissions are strongly ordered in angle, and thus emitted independently.
The matrix element used to compute the function FNLL is simply given by a product of an
arbitrary number of single-gluon emission squared amplitudes ˜M 2
sc(ki), in the decomposition
of Eq. (2.17). However, starting from NNLL two or more resolved emissions can become close
in angle. In this type of conﬁgurations, the squared amplitude is given by an abelian term
(deﬁned by the product of n single emission probabilities) and by non-abelian, correlated
clusters of two or more particles (see Eq. (2.17)). At NNLL it is suﬃcient to account for
the eﬀect of only two emissions getting close in angle, while the others can be considered far
apart. This induces two types of corrections: δFcorrel and Fclust.

The correlated correction δFcorrel accounts for the insertion in the resolved ensemble of soft-
collinear, independently emitted gluons of a single double-soft cluster ˜M 2
s,0(k1, k2) that is
deﬁned as the non-abelian part of the square of the double-soft current [54]. More details on
this correction will be given in Sec. 3.4.

The clustering correction δFclust (deﬁned in Ref. [55]), on the other hand, accounts for the
contribution of two independently emitted gluons that become close in angle. Due to the
nature of most event shapes, this correction normally vanishes and it becomes diﬀerent from
zero only when the observable has a non-trivial dependence on the rapidity of the emissions,
as for instance in the case of jet rates [55].

• The corrections δFhc and δFrec originate from the second term in the curly brackets of
Eq. (2.39), and have a hard-collinear nature. The emission of a hard collinear parton in-
duces two types of corrections: at the level of the squared amplitude (encoded in δFhc), and
at the level of the kinematics, due to the recoil of the whole event against the hard-collinear
emission (encoded in δFrec).

were neglected. The function FNLL is purely NLL [18], while the multiplying constants H (1)
and C (1)

hc,(cid:96) induce NNLL corrections.

Since the detailed formulation of the functions FNLL and δFNNLL is given in refs. [18, 54, 55], we
do not report their expressions here, and refer to the original publications.

In the next section we perform the calculation of the Sudakov radiator at NNLL accuracy.
Before we proceed, it is important to stress that in the deﬁnition of the unresolved soft radiation

– 12 –

given in Eq. (2.24) one clearly has some freedom in deciding precisely how the resolution variable
is deﬁned. In particular, instead of Vsc, one could use any observable Vres that shares the same
leading logarithms as the full observable V that is being resummed. This is in fact the only requisite
for this method to be applied. The choice of Vsc is mainly due to computational convenience, as
all ingredients in the Sudakov radiator can be computed analytically for any rIRC safe observable.
Choosing another resolution variable would change the expression in the Sudakov radiator, and
consequently the expression of the functions FNLL and δFNNLL.

A particularly important aspect of the deﬁnition of the resolution variable concerns the way
Vsc in Eq. (2.24) is evaluated on the total momentum kclust. of a cluster of more than one particle.
Although the cluster has a non-zero invariant mass, Vsc (2.7) does not depend on the mass, and
hence, in the deﬁnition resolution scale, the cluster is treated as if it were massless. This will lead
to great simpliﬁcations in evaluating the Sudakov radiator, where the integral over the invariant
mass can be evaluated analytically as it will be shown in Sec. 3. The prescription of treating the
cluster as massless also impacts the deﬁnition of the correlated correction δFcorrel, that will be the
subject of Sec. 3.4.

massive rapidity y of the web as deﬁned in Eq. (2.10), while the observable is expressed in terms of
the rapidity of a massless parton η((cid:96)). Now we wish to write Eq. (3.1) in a way in which LL, NLL

The separation of the radiator as in Eq. (3.5) has a physical justiﬁcation. If one ignores the running
of the coupling constant, then the massless radiator R0
(cid:96) (v) only contains double logarithmic terms,
while the mass correction δR(cid:96)(v) is purely single logarithmic.

Let us now focus of the massless radiator at NNLL. Eq. (3.6) can be easily evaluated by
observing that the resolution variable does not depend on the mass of the web. Therefore, in
t + m2) over its
Eq. (3.6) we can freely integrate over this variable. The integral of the web w(m2, k2
invariant mass deﬁnes a generalisation of the physical CMW coupling [61]:

Note that K (1) is proportional to the two-loop cusp anomalous dimension, but this is not true any
more starting from K (2). We stress that this is not the case for rIRC unsafe cases, such as threshold
resummation. In this case, one needs to perform the integration over the web transverse momentum
in d dimensions and subtract the residual collinear singularity in a given factorisation scheme. The
divergent integral over kt then gives an extra contribution that enters at same order as K (2) so that
the coeﬃcient of the α3

sL2 term in the Sudakov coincides with the cusp anomalous dimension.

For the computation of the mass correction at NNLL, we only need to consider the web up
to α2

From the above derivation we observe that the O(α3
s) correction to the physical coupling (3.9) is the
only place where the α3
s web enters in a NNLL resummation of any rIRC safe observable. Indeed
the resolved real corrections only involve correlated blocks with up to two soft partons. Therefore,
the physical coupling deﬁned in Eq. (3.9) constitutes a universal ingredient to account for the triple-
correlated soft contribution (and relative virtual corrections due to the double-correlated soft at
one loop as well as single-correlated soft at two loops) at NNLL accuracy. In particular, it deﬁnes
a building block of a parton shower algorithm at this order, that will be relevant in the context of
the current eﬀorts that aim at improving the accuracy of these algorithms [64–71].

It is customary to express the radiator in terms of λ = αsβ0 ln(1/v), with αs = αs(Q). We
further parametrize the radiator in terms of functions of λ, in such a way as to separate LL, NLL

dently. The invariant mass of the web is denoted by m2 = (ka + kb)2. The conﬁguration in which
ka and kb are collinear to diﬀerent Born legs requires the parent gluon to be emitted with a large
angle, and hence gives at most a N3LL contribution. The observable

simply denotes the soft-collinear approximation of the full observable, as this is the only limit
relevant here.

In order to make sense of the diﬀerence between the two Θ functions, we should ﬁrst discuss

how the cluster of two soft partons is treated in the ARES algorithm.

The two-particle correlated soft block ˜M 2

s,0(ka, kb) diverges when ka and kb are collinear, i.e.
when the invariant mass of the cluster tends to zero. Such a divergence is entirely cancelled by
the one-loop correction to the single-emission cluster ˜M 2
s,1(k), that should be included at NNLL. In
the evaluation of the Sudakov radiator, as shown in Sec. 3, the cancellation of the above collinear
singularity is performed analytically. This is because we chose to deﬁne a resolution variable that
does not depend on the invariant mass of the cluster, and hence the corresponding integral becomes
straightforward. This inclusive integration of ˜M 2
s,1(k) is responsible for the presence
of the physical coupling in the radiator, see Eq. (3.9).

s,0(ka, kb) and ˜M 2

In the resolved radiation, however, the situation is more complicated, as in the full observable
we are not allowed to integrate over the invariant mass of the cluster inclusively. We can, however,
deﬁne the following subtraction scheme to cancel the collinear singularity arising from ˜M 2
s,0(ka, kb)
in four dimensions. We ﬁrst treat the {ka, kb} cluster inclusively, as done in the deﬁnition of the
radiator. This can be done by considering only the total momentum ka + kb when evaluating
the contribution of the cluster to the observable, and treat it as if it were a massless (lightlike)
momentum in the computation of the observable. This once again allows us to combine it with the
one loop correction to the single-emission cluster ˜M 2
s,1(k) analytically. This contribution is encoded
in δFsc which features the coeﬃcient K (1) of Eq. (3.11a), as explained in refs. [54, 55]. As a second
step, we consider the diﬀerence between the full observable, where the {ka, kb} cluster is treated
exclusively, and its inclusive approximation that we considered above to cancel the singularity
against the virtual correction. This is represented by the diﬀerence in the two Θ functions in
Eq. (3.34). It is important to bear in mind that in the second Θ function the observable Vsc treats
the momentum ka + kb as if it were massless, in order to exactly match our convention for the
cancellation of real and virtual corrections in δFsc. This is implemented by the limit in the second
Θ function in Eq. (3.34).

There are many ways to parametrise the phase space for ka and kb to keep, in δFcorrel, only
NNLL contributions that correspond to conﬁgurations in which ka and kb are collinear to the same
Born leg. One possible parametrisation was presented in Ref. [54].
Instead, here we adopt the
notation of appendix A, that is the same we used to compute the NNLL radiator. We deﬁne the
rescaled invariant mass of the {ka, kb} cluster µ2 = m2/k2
t , and we introduce the pseudo-parent
parton k of ka and kb with transverse momentum kt and observable fraction ζ deﬁned as

(cid:126)kt = (cid:126)kt,a + (cid:126)kt,b ,

ζ ≡

with Cab(µ, z, φ) = C(ka, kb) given by Eq. (A.9), and µ2 ∈ [0, ∞), z ∈ [0, 1], φ ∈ [0, 2π). The
matrix element squared and phase space for the pseudo-parent k is given in Eq. (2.32). Actually,
due to the fact that the pseudo-parent has a non-zero invariant-mass, the integral over its rapidity
η((cid:96)) should have the boundary |η((cid:96))| < ln(Q/(cid:112)k2
t + m2). However, following what is done in the
computation of the NLL function FNLL [18], we observe that the exact position of the rapidity
integration bound in the resolved radiation enters at one logarithmic order higher. Therefore, in
order to neglect all N3LL corrections and obtain a result that is purely NNLL, we replace the actual

rapidity integration limit with the massless one, as done in Eq. (2.32). The integral over η((cid:96)) can
be evaluated analytically [54] and the correlated correction takes the following simple form

Naturally, for analytic calculations the parametrisation for the phase space and matrix element
should be chosen in order to simplify the integrals for any given observable. The present choice
will make the integrations in the next section simpler, while an alternative parametrisation was
reported in Ref. [54].

3.4.1 Additive observables

A particularly interesting case is that of additive observable, for which all NNLL corrections admit
a simple analytic form, reported in the appendix of Ref. [54]. The correlated correction for such
observables can be simpliﬁed considerably. The additivity of the observable implies that

Vsc({˜p}, ka, kb, k1, . . . , kn) = Vsc(ka) + Vsc(kb) + Vsc({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) ,

Vsc({˜p}, ka + kb, k1, . . . , kn) = Vsc(ka + kb) + Vsc({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) .

We now introduce f ((cid:96))

correl(µ, z, φ) as:

Vsc(ka) + Vsc(kb) = ζv f ((cid:96))

correl(µ, z, φ) .

This gives

(3.41)

Following the derivation in the appendix of Ref. [54], we can now rescale the momenta k1, . . . , kn
in two ways. In Eq. (3.38), in the term involving the step function of Vsc({˜p}, ka, kb, k1, . . . , kn), we
construct rescaled momenta ˜k1, . . . , ˜kn such that

Vsc({˜p}, ˜k1, . . . , ˜kn) =

This result will be used in Sec. 4 to obtain the NNLL resummation for angularities and moments
of energy-energy correlation.

4 Fully worked out examples: angularities and moments of EEC

In this section we apply the resummation procedure described in the previous sections to interesting
observables in e+e− annihilation, namely angularities and moments of energy-energy correlation.

Angularities are deﬁned with respect to some reference axis, usually the thrust [72] or the

winner-take-all (WTA) [17, 73] axis. They depend on a parameter x, as follows

τx ≡

(cid:80)

i Ei| sin θi|x(1 − | cos θi|)1−x
i |(cid:126)qi|

(cid:80)

,

(4.1)

where the sum runs over all hadrons in the event, (Ei, (cid:126)qi) is the four-momentum of hadron i, and
θi is the angle between hadron i and the reference axis.

In Ref. [18], another class of observables was introduced, the fractional moments of energy-

energy correlation (EEC), deﬁned by

F Cx =

(cid:88)

i(cid:54)=j

EiEj| sin θij|x(1 − | cos θij|)1−x
i Ei)2

((cid:80)

Θ [((cid:126)qi · nT )((cid:126)qj · (cid:126)nT )] ,

(4.2)

where, as before, the sums run over all hadrons in the event, θij denotes the angle between hadrons
i and j, and (cid:126)nT is the thrust axis. Note that similar variables have attracted interest due to their
discriminating power between quark- and gluon-initiated jets [73]. For instance, in jet studies for
e+e− collisions, one considers

C (β)

1 ≡

(cid:88)

i(cid:54)=j

EiEj
Q2 θβ
ij ,

(4.3)

where one considers the particles i, j within a given jet. At hadron colliders the deﬁnition of C (β)
[73]
involves the transverse momentum and the angular distance R2
ij between ﬁnal state
particles. The global component of the resummed cross section for these observables has analogous

ij = ∆y2

ij + ∆φ2

1

– 20 –

resummation properties as the observables F C2−β studied here. However, in this case, the cross
section receives a non-global logarithmic correction starting at NLL. Both angularities with respect
to the WTA axis and moments of EEC have the property that, in the presence of multiple soft and
collinear emissions k1, . . . , kn, they are always additive, i.e.

Vsc({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) =

n
(cid:88)

i=1

Vsc(ki) .

(4.4)

Angularities with respect to the thrust axis are additive as long as x < 1 [18]. For these observables,
x < 1 is the range of values of x that we will implicitly consider in the following.

The NNLL resummed distribution is given by Eq. (2.45). Our task is to compute each ingredient
of that formula. First, we observe that both τx and F Cx are infrared safe, and collinear safe for
x < 2. With a single soft and collinear emission, and in the range of values of x appropriate for
each observable, we have

Vsc(k) =

e−(1−x)η((cid:96))

,

(cid:96) = 1, 2 .

(4.5)

kt
Q

Therefore, the soft-collinear radiator Rs(v), the hard-collinear radiator Rhc(v) and the hard-collinear
constant C (1)
hc,(cid:96) are obtained by computing Eqs. (3.3), (3.13) and (2.41) respectively, with a = 1,
b(cid:96) = 1−x, and d(cid:96) = g(cid:96)(φ) = 1. In the following subsections, we compute the corrections due to real
radiation.

The results we will present below for the WTA-axis angularities have been found to be in
complete agreement with the ﬁndings of Ref. [33], that have been obtained in a SCET framework.

Here, for notational convenience, we introduced R(cid:48)

and R(cid:48)(cid:48). Note that both expressions in Eqs. (4.6) and (4.7) do not depend explicitly on the parameter
x, but this dependence is implicit in the functions R(cid:48)

NLL,2, and similarly for R(cid:48)

NLL,1 + R(cid:48)

NLL = R(cid:48)

NLL, R(cid:48)

NNLL and R(cid:48)(cid:48).

4.2 Hard-collinear and recoil corrections

If we add to an ensemble of soft and collinear emissions k1, . . . , kn a single hard emission k, collinear
to either p1 or p2, our observables behave as follows

Vhc({˜p}, k, k1, . . . , kn) − V ({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) =

(cid:19)2−x

(cid:18) kt
Q

f ((cid:96))
hc (z, φ((cid:96))) .

For the angularities with respect to the thrust axis, we obtain

f ((cid:96))
hc (z, φ((cid:96))) =

z1−x + (1 − z)1−x
[z(1 − z)]1−x

,

x < 1 ,

whereas if we compute angularities with respect to the WTA axis, we obtain

(4.8)

(4.9)

f ((cid:96))
hc (z, φ((cid:96))) =

1
[z(1 − z)]1−x

1
max[z, 1 − z]

,

x < 2 .

(4.10)

– 21 –

Finally, for fractional moments of EEC, we get

f ((cid:96))
hc (z, φ((cid:96))) =

1
[z(1 − z)]1−x ,

x < 2 .

If we extrapolate f ((cid:96))

hc (z, φ((cid:96))) for z → 0 we obtain the same result for all observables:

f ((cid:96))
hc (z, φ((cid:96))) →

1

4.3 Soft wide-angle corrections

If we add to an ensemble of soft and collinear emissions, k1, . . . , kn, a single soft emission k, at an
angle θ with respect to the thrust axis that is much larger than that of all other emissions, we have

| sin θk1| (cid:39) | sin θk2| (cid:39) | sin θ| ,

(4.17)

where θk(cid:96) is the angle between k and ˜p(cid:96), with (cid:96) = 1, 2. Also, for any appropriate value of x, since
k is the emission at the largest angle, its transverse momentum with respect to its emitter is the

– 22 –

same as that with respect to the thrust axis. Therefore, for all considered observables, we have

Vwa({˜p}, k, k1, . . . , kn) − Vsc({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) =

kt
Q

(cid:18) 1 + | cos θ|
1 − | cos θ|

(cid:19) x−1

=

kt
Q

e−(1−x)|η| = Vsc(k) .

(4.18)

Therefore, Vwa({˜p}, k, k1, . . . , kn) = Vsc({˜p}, k, k1, . . . , kn), and δFwa = 0.

4.4 Correlated corrections

Since all the observables we consider are the same in the soft and collinear limit, whenever we have
any two soft emissions ka, kb, collinear to the same leg (cid:96), together with an ensemble of soft-collinear
emissions k1, . . . , kn, we obtain

Vsc({˜p}, ka, kb, k1, . . . , kn) − Vsc({˜p}, k1, . . . , kn) = Vsc(ka) + Vsc(kb) .

(4.19)

In terms of the variables deﬁned in appendix A, we have

Vsc(ka) + Vsc(kb) =

(4.20)

Using the rescaled variables µ2 ≡ m2/k2
obtain

t and (cid:126)ui ≡ (cid:126)qi/kt, and using the notation of section 3.4.1, we

fcorrel(z, µ, φ) ≡ (1 + µ2)

(4.21)

(cid:112)1 + µ2

(cid:2)z + (1 − z)µ2 + (1 − z) + zµ2(cid:3) =

(4.23)

This implies that, for x = 0, one has

Vsc(ka) + Vsc(kb) =

(cid:112)k2

e−η((cid:96))

= V ({˜p}, ka + kb) .

(4.24)

Therefore, only for x = 0 are the considered observables fully inclusive with respect to multiple
collinear splittings. This result generalises to an arbitrary number of soft and collinear emissions.
Now we can compute δFcorrel for any value of x using the general formula in Eq. (3.44). We

4.5 Matching and issues with Sudakov shoulders for F Cx

It is interesting to study the matching to ﬁxed order for the moments of energy energy corre-
lation (4.2). Such observables feature a Sudakov shoulder [74], whose position can get danger-
ously close to the Sudakov peak for certain values of x. To examine this feature we now match
the resummed NNLL distributions to NLO ﬁxed-order diﬀerential cross sections obtained with
EVENT2 [75]. Although we only analyse F Cx below, the procedure discussed in the following applies
to all observables considered in this article. The matching is performed according to the log-R
scheme (see for instance [25, 76]). As it is customary in resummed calculations, to probe the size
of subleading logarithmic terms we introduce a rescaling constant xV as

ln

1
v

= ln

xV
v

− ln xV ,

(4.28)

and expand the cross section around ln xV /v neglecting subleading terms.6 Eventually we modify
the resummed logarithm ln xV /v in order to impose that the total cross section is reproduced at
the kinematical endpoint vmax

has to replace ln xL → − ln xV .

to the endpoint. Since in the following we do not perform a phenomenological study, we simply set
p = 1 and vmax = 1 for the sake of simplicity.

To obtain our central predictions we set µR = Q, with Q being the centre-of-mass energy of the
hard scattering, corresponding to αs(MZ) = 0.118, and xV = 1. We then construct the uncertainty
bands by varying µR and xV individually by a factor of two in either direction. The relevant
formulae for the scale dependence are reported in the appendix of Ref. [54].

Q = MZ . The lower inset shows the ratio to the relative central value for each of the two bands.

Figure 2 shows the NLO diﬀerential distribution matched to both NLL and NNLL for the cases

x = 1/2 and x = 1. From the plots one can appreciate the following two interesting features.

The ﬁrst is that the size of NNLL corrections increases with x. This can be explained by
inspecting the parametrisation of the observable in the soft and collinear limit (4.5). The charac-
teristic transverse momentum of the soft radiation is kt ∼ Qv, while the hard-collinear radiation
1
2−x , with x < 2. The soft scale is therefore lower than the collinear scales
occurs at scales kt ∼ Qv
for x < 1, the two coincide for x = 1, and the situation is inverted for 2 > x > 1. For a given
value v of the observable, the typical size of the soft logarithms (and hence of the soft corrections)
does not depend on the moment parameter x. Conversely, the size of the hard-collinear logarithms
increases with x, hence leading to larger subleading corrections. One also expects that corrections
beyond NNLL become more sizeable as x increases, as it is reﬂected by the scale uncertainty band
in Figure 2. For x > 1 the subleading corrections grow very large as the collinear scale becomes
smaller than the soft one, which corresponds to a badly convergent logarithmic series. A conse-
quence of this fact is that for x > 1 the abscissa of the Landau pole moves towards larger values of
v, and hence the diﬀerential distribution becomes non-perturbative at moderate values of v.

A second interesting observation is that the relative distance between the Sudakov peak and
the shoulder decreases for increasing x. This implies that there is a value of x for which the two
overlap. Such a situation can be observed in the left plot of Figure 3 for x = 3/2, where the curves
are obtained at the Z resonance and for central values of the scales.

In this case the solution provided by the resummation in the two-jet limit is obviously un-
physical. The position of the Sudakov peak represents the bulk of the soft and collinear radiation
probability in the two-jet conﬁguration, and it coincides with the kinematic endpoint for the three-
jet conﬁguration, above which the distribution is again dominated by soft and collinear emissions.
This phenomenon is due to the violation of momentum conservation in the formulation of
the resummed calculation, in which the exact kinematics in the presence of an extra hard parton
is ignored. In such a situation one should perform a simultaneous resummation of the Sudakov

logarithms treated here together with the logarithms that originate at the shoulder. This is currently
out of reach at the logarithmic order analysed in this article.

While in this case a matching to ﬁxed order results in an unphysical prediction, the right plot
of Figure 3 shows that the situation improves at higher collider energies. As can be seen from this
plot, for higher collider energies the position of the Sudakov peak moves towards smaller values
of the observable, driven by the smaller coupling constant, while the position of the shoulder does
note depend on Q. At these scales the resummed result is physical and can be matched to the ﬁxed
order. An example is reported in Figure 4, where the matched distribution for Q = 1 TeV is shown.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have completed the study of jet observables at NNLL accuracy in e+e− annihilation,
that started in refs. [54, 55]. These results constitute the core of the ARES method for the semi-
numerical resummation of jet observables at NNLL accuracy, which generalises the NLL procedure
of refs. [18–20]. This involves the calculation of an observable dependent Sudakov form factor, the
radiator, which encodes the all-order cancellation of infrared singularities between real and virtual
contributions, and that we have computed at NNLL accuracy for a generic rIRC safe observable.

As a byproduct, we have deﬁned a generalisation of the well known CMW physical coupling

it constitutes one of the main ingredients for a NNLL accurate parton shower algorithm.

As an application, we have computed NNLL resummed distributions for angularities and frac-
tional moments of EEC, for all allowed values of the parameter x they depend on. We have also
presented a very basic phenomenology of moments of EEC, highlighting their main features. A
particularly severe issue is that, for x > 1, the Sudakov peak of the diﬀerential distribution, where
the observable should be dominated by multiple soft-collinear emissions, becomes dangerously close
to the edge of the phase space for real emissions, so that the core approximation underlying soft-
collinear resummations breaks down. This situation is severe at LEP energies and prevents us to
make any sense of resummed prediction matched to ﬁxed order for certain values of x > 1. This
is not the case at a future e+e− collider with centre-of-mass energy of 1 TeV, where the Sudakov
peak moves towards lower values of the observable, while the position of the kinematical boundary
stays unchanged. This is a feature that should be considered when using these observables for
phenomenology.

We stress that the procedure outlined in this paper is only an example on how to construct
a Sudakov radiator. The same calculation could for instance be performed at all orders using
the methods of Soft-Collinear Eﬀective Theory (SCET), along the lines of what has been shown
for thrust in Ref. [77]. To achieve a full resummation, the radiator should be supplemented by
appropriate NLL and NNLL corrections due to the resolved real radiation. In this paper, we have
deﬁned the Sudakov radiator in such a way that all NLL, and most NNLL corrections are the same
as in refs. [54, 55]. The only exception is the NNLL correction δFcorrel, which we had to redeﬁne
to ensure that the radiator could be computed analytically for a generic rIRC safe observable.

We also note that this very same radiator could in principle be used also for processes with
incoming hadrons, for reactions with two hard emitting legs at the Born level. In that case, all
corrections due to soft radiation, FNLL, δFsc, δFwa, δFcorrel stay unchanged, and one has to evaluate
parton distribution functions at the factorisation scales of order v1/(a+b(cid:96))Q, and recompute only
the hard-collinear contributions C (1)
hc,(cid:96), δFhc, δFrec, as done for instance in Ref. [51, 78] for certain
classes of observables. For processes with more than two legs, all terms in the master formula (2.45)
must be redeﬁned in order to account for the structure of the wide-angle soft radiation. This will
be left for future work.

In summary, this work completes the formulation of a general method for to the calculation
of any jet observable in processes with two legs, that can be systematically generalised to more
complicated cases. We hope that the results presented here will deﬁne a solid starting point for
future systematic studies of jet observables at all perturbative orders.

A Correlated two-parton emission

We start by decomposing the momenta of the two partons ka and kb as in Eq. (2.1). We then
introduce relative variables to parameterise the two-parton phase space, as follows

The contribution due to two ﬁnal-state quarks in Eq. (A.9) has been multiplied by two, to com-
pensate for the overall 1/2! factor in Eq. (3.38). The three functions S, Hg and Hq are the 4 − 2(cid:15)-
dimensional counterparts of the homonymous terms deﬁned in Ref. [79]. They depend only on the
dimensionsless variables z, φ and µ2 ≡ m2/k2
