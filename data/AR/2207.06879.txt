ABSTRACT

We have reviewed the ﬁrst year of observations of the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard Chandrayaan-2,
and the available multi-wavelength observations to complement the XSM data, focusing on Solar Dynamics
Observatory AIA and Hinode XRT, EIS observations. XSM has provided disk-integrated solar spectra in the
1–15 keV energy range, observing a large number of microﬂares. We present an analysis of multi-wavelength
observations of AR 12759 during its disk crossing. We use a new radiometric calibration of EIS to ﬁnd that
the quiescent AR core emission during its disk crossing has a distribution of temperatures and chemical abun-
dances that does not change signiﬁcantly over time. An analysis of the XSM spectra conﬁrms the EIS results,
and shows that the low First Ionization Potential (FIP) elements are enhanced, compared to their photospheric
values. The frequent microﬂares produced by the AR did not affect the abundances of the quiescent AR core.
We also present an analysis of one of the ﬂares it produced, SOL2020-04-09T09:32. The XSM analysis indi-
cates isothermal temperatures reaching 6 MK. The lack of very high-T emission is conﬁrmed by AIA. We ﬁnd
excellent agreement between the observed XSM spectrum and the one predicted using an AIA DEM analysis.
In contrast, the XRT Al-Poly / Be-thin ﬁlter ratio gives lower temperatures for the quiescent and ﬂaring phases.
We show that this is due to the sensitivity of this ratio to low temperatures, as the XRT ﬁlter ratios predicted
with a DEM analysis based on EIS and AIA gives values in good agreement with the observed ones.

1. INTRODUCTION

There is ample literature on observations and modelling
of relatively large ﬂares, of GOES X-class C and above, but
comparatively little on the weaker ﬂares in active region (AR)
cores, despite the fact that they are much more frequent. We
deﬁne here microﬂares as those events of GOES class A or
below, not to be confused with larger ﬂares, often also called
microﬂares. The physics of microﬂares remains elusive, as
key spectroscopic observations to study the evolution of 5–
10 MK plasma have been lacking, as discussed in the review
by Del Zanna et al. (2021). The review points out the need

for high-resolution, high-sensitivity spectral imaging in the
soft X-rays (100–150 Å) to study microﬂares.

An earlier statistical study based on GOES X-ray and
Yohkoh Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) observations
found a relationship between temperatures (Tmax) and X-ray
emission measures (EM) at the peak of the X-ray emission,
with lower-class microﬂares generally having lower tempera-
tures (Feldman et al. 1996). A-class microﬂares had temper-
atures around 5 MK i.e. close to the ‘basal’ 2–3 MK values
of active region cores (cf Del Zanna & Mason 2018). One
limitation of this and similar studies was the assumption that
the plasma was isothermal.

Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) broad-band observa-
tions of microﬂares in AR cores were used to obtain isother-
mal temperatures ranging between 4–8 MK (Shimizu 1995),
lasting for 2–7 min.

DEL ZANNA, G. ET AL.

The sensitivity of the SphinX X-ray irradiance spectrome-
ter, on board the CORONAS-PHOTON mission was higher
than that of the earlier GOES X-ray monitors, and showed
that microﬂares are indeed very common. Some studies
of the general characteristcs of microﬂares, produced from
the Bremsstrahlung emission and the isothermal assumption
(see, e.g. Kirichenko & Bogachev 2017), found a relation be-
tween Tmax and EM for the smaller events that was different
to that found by Feldman et al. (1996).

Studies of a few microﬂares, based on NuSTAR observa-
tions of the Bremsstrahlung emission and again the isother-
mal assumption (see, e.g. Hannah et al. 2019; Cooper et al.
2020; Duncan et al. 2021) have been published. Tempera-
tures were in the range 4–8 MK and little evidence of non-
thermal emission was generally found.

Several questions arise from previous studies of ﬂares.
First, is there a relation between the highest temperatures
in the post-ﬂare loops and the X-ray class ? The above-
mentioned Feldman et al. (1996) study clearly indicates that
larger ﬂares have higher temperatures at their peak X-ray
emission, but there are e.g. B-class ﬂares that reach very
different maximum temperatures. In the example discussed
below, a B-class ﬂare did not reach 7 MK, while in the text-
book case of another B-class ﬂare, observed by Hinode EIS
(Culhane et al. 2007), a peak temperature of 12 MK was
reached (Del Zanna et al. 2011). Perhaps such differences
are related to the physical size of the ﬂaring volume. A study
of larger (GOES C8 class) ﬂares by Bowen et al. (2013) in-
deed indicated that the peak temperature (in the 10–20 MK
range) is inversely correlated with ﬂare volume.

Second, is the isothermal assumption reasonable for small
ﬂares? To address this question, detailed spectroscopic ob-
servations are needed. Some information was obtained by
Mitra-Kraev & Del Zanna (2019) with the analysis of Hin-
ode EIS observations of a microﬂare. This event was com-
posed of a bundle of strands being activated at similar times,
with sizes that appeared resolved at the AIA resolution,
1′′. The EIS spectra indicated that these strands had rel-
atively low peak temperatures (about 4–5 MK) and were
nearly isothermal in their cross-section, although the 5–10
MK temperature range was not well constrained (see also
Winebarger et al. 2012, on the limitations in this range). The
EIS results were consistent with the broad-band observations
by the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (SDO/AIA) (Lemen et al. 2012) and Hinode XRT.
Multi-wavelength observations of several other microﬂares
were studied by Mitra-Kraev & Del Zanna (2019), indicating
that the example provided was a ’typical’ case.

Another science questions about microﬂares relates to their
possible contribution to the basal heating in AR cores. This
basal emission has peak near-isothermal emission around 3
MK and does not signiﬁcantly change its characteristics over

time (Del Zanna 2013a; Del Zanna et al. 2015). Detailed
studies about the frequency of microﬂares have been lacking.
They have typical lifetimes of about 10 minutes as seen in
the EUV (Mitra-Kraev & Del Zanna 2019). The older X-ray
observations of AR cores from the Solar Maximum Mission
(SMM) X-ray polychromator (Acton et al. 1980) Bent Crys-
tal Spectrometer (BCS) also showed common weak ﬂaring
emission on those timescales (Del Zanna & Mason 2014), so
it is possible that they were the same type of events. The
Mg XII images from CORONAS-PHOTON also show a peak
in the distribution of AR ﬂaring events around 10 minutes
(Reva et al. 2018), although it is not clear if these are the
same features (temperatures are uncertain as Mg XII can be
formed between 5 and 25 MK).

such as

the B-class

Larger ﬂares

textbook case
(Del Zanna et al. 2011) show quick chromospheric evapo-
ration and ﬁlling of the ﬂare loops with hot (above 10 MK)
plasma, with a slow cooling phase where the plasma radiates
at all temperatures whilst draining back to the chromosphere.
In contrast, microﬂare loops are observed to cool down to
nearly the background 3 MK, but then drain/disappear very
quickly and do not show emission at lower temperatures
(Mitra-Kraev & Del Zanna 2019). This suggests that mi-
croﬂares do not contribute to the basal emission in AR cores.
The chemical abundances of the ﬂaring plasma also hold
key information related to the heating and cooling. The
chemical abundances of low- FIP elements such as Fe, Si,
relative to those of high-FIP ones such as S,O,Ne were found
to be increased by a factor of about 3.2 (with respect to the
photospheric values) for AR cores, regardless of their size
and age (Del Zanna 2013a; Del Zanna & Mason 2014). This
is the so-called FIP effect.

The FIP effect has gained a lot of interest in recent liter-
ature. It is most likely caused by ion-neutral separation in
the chromosphere, due to the Ponderomotive force of trapped
Alfven waves in magnetically-closed loops (see references
in Laming 2015). Observationally, there has been a wide
range of different chemical abundances measured in coronal
plasma, as reviewed by Laming (2015); Del Zanna & Mason
(2018). Regarding large ﬂares, there is ample evidence that
the ﬂare loops have near-photospheric abundances. We do
not have measurements of abundances in microﬂares, but if
they were available and were also photospheric, that would
also provide an indication that microﬂares do not contribute
to the basal emission in AR cores.

The Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) (Vadawale et al. 2014;
Shanmugam et al. 2020) onboard Chandrayaan-2 has been
providing disk-integrated spectra in the 1 – 15 keV energy
range since September 2019, providing temperatures, emis-
sion measures, and absolute chemical abundances of a few
elements, with timescales of the order of a minute. XSM has
a much greater sensitivity than previous GOES X-ray moni-

tors, and is able to observe microﬂares down to A 0.01 class.
A discussion of sub-A class ﬂares during the minimum of
solar cycle 24, and which occurred outside of ARs was pre-
sented in Vadawale et al. (2021a). The instrument has also
been used to study the X-ray emission of the global quiet Sun
corona, which was found to be dominated by X-ray bright
points. A temperature close to 2 MK and a coronal FIP bias
of about two were found (Vadawale et al. 2021b).

XSM does not have enough sensitivity to measure chem-
ical abundances for individual microﬂares, but is able to do
so for B-class ﬂares. Mondal et al. (2021) presented a time-
resolved spectroscopic analysis of several B-class ﬂares oc-
curring in AR cores. During the peak of the X-ray emission,
temperatures reached 6–8 MK, whilst the chemical abun-
dances of Mg, Al, and Si decreased towards their photo-
spheric values. Similar decreases in the abundances were
found at the peaks of larger ﬂares by the Miniature X-Ray
Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat (Woods et al. 2017;
Moore et al. 2018). During the gradual decay phase, the
XSM measurements found that the chemical abundances re-
turned to their pre-ﬂare coronal values. The MinXSS and
XSM measurements are the ﬁrst observations of this kind,
providing new observational constraints to models of the at-
mosphere which include element fractionation, such as those
of Laming (2017).

To complement the XSM observations, in particular to un-
derstand the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission ob-
served by XSM, we have run several multi-wavelength cam-
paigns, including Hinode HOP 396. For this paper, we have
selected observations during March/April 2020, when a sin-
gle AR (NOAA 12759) crossed the solar disk and produced
many microﬂares and several B-class ﬂares. The main aim of
this paper is to present a multi-wavelength analysis of Hin-
ode XRT and EIS observations, combined with XSM and
SDO/AIA during the AR disk passage, to establish the ac-
tive region core temperatures and abundances, and discuss
the temperatures of one of the ﬂares, as measurable by these
instruments.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

We have analysed a large number of microﬂares observed
by XSM during the ﬁrst period of operations and searched for
suitable Hinode observations. We have selected for presenta-
tion here observations of AR 12759 during its disk crossing,
as a direct comparison between the XSM irradiances and the
signal measured by the other instruments is straightforward,
as this was the only AR on the disk. Also, we selected one of
the ﬂares to study, which occurred on Apr 9, as it had XRT
coverage. EIS observed the AR in several instances during
its quiescent phase, but did not observe any ﬂares.

XSM observes the Sun from a lunar orbit.

It provides
disk-integrated solar spectra at every second in the energy
range of 1-15 keV with an unprecedented energy resolution
of 180 eV at 5.9 keV (Mithun et al. 2020). The observed
raw (level-1) spectra at every second are stored in a day-
wise data ﬁle. Since the visibility of the Sun varies within
the XSM ﬁeld of view and the Sun also gets occulted by
the moon, the level-1 data contains both solar spectra as
well as non-solar background. We used XSM Data Analy-
sis Software (Mithun et al. 2021) to generate the level-2 sci-
ence data product for the Solar observations by selecting the
Good Time Intervals (GTI) based on the observing geometry
and a few other instrumental parameters. To do a spectral
analysis of the XSM spectra we used the “chisoth” model
(Mondal et al. 2021). This is a local model of X-ray spectral
ﬁtting package (XSPEC) (Arnaud 1996), meant for the spec-
tral ﬁtting of the observed X-ray spectrum. The “chisoth”
model calculates the synthetic photon spectrum from a spec-
tral library, generated by using CHIANTI v.10. The model
takes the logarithm of the temperature, abundances of the el-
ements with Z=2 to Z=30, and the volume emission measure
as input parameters.

Fig. 1 shows the XSM 2–15 keV lightcurve during the disk
crossing of AR 12759. By March 28 the outer part of the
AR appeared outside the east limb, when the X-ray ‘back-
ground’ increased. During its disk crossing, this AR (the only
one on the visible disc) produced many microﬂares. A few
of the larger, B-class ﬂares have already been analysed by
Mondal et al. (2021). In all those cases, the behaviour of the
chemical abundances was similar, i.e. the abundances were
closer to photospheric values during peak X-ray emission.
By April 12 the core of the AR was behind the west limb.
This paper focuses on an analysis of the quiescent emission
from the AR during its disk crossing on the Apr 1, 4, 8 and
the B-class ﬂare that peaked on Apr 9 around 9:12 UT. The
XSM lightcurves for Apr 1, 4, 9 are shown in Fig. 1 (bottom
plots, on Apr 8 XSM did not observe).

2.2. Hinode XRT

We processed the XRT images using the standard Solar-
Soft procedures, paying particular attention in removing sat-
urated images and taking into account the pointing informa-
tion stored in the XRT database (SolarSoft dbase). To obtain
the temperatures, we used CHIANTI v.10 (Del Zanna et al.
2021) atomic data and calculated the responses. The Al poly /
Be thin ﬁlter ratio is essentially insensitive to different chem-
ical abundances 1.

We have analysed full-Sun XRT synoptic observations dur-
ing the AR disk crossing. The averaged count rates in the
Be-thin ﬁlter for a selection of dates are shown in Fig. 1 as

boxes, scaled by a normalization factor. There is generally
good agreement in the variability of the XRT signal in this
ﬁlter and the XSM count rates, as expected. This is because
the XSM sensitivity is close to that of this XRT ﬁlter. The
XRT Be-thin full-disk images are also very useful for check-
ing that AR 12759, even during quiescence, is dominating
the full-disk signal. This means that the XSM signal is also
dominated by the active region, making a direct comparison
between XSM and the other instruments (XRT, EIS, AIA)
possible.

There are also many XRT partial-frame observations of the
active region during its disk crossing, with the same ﬁlters.
We have used one set for a direct EIS/XRT cross-calibration.
For each XSM ﬂare we searched for available XRT ob-
servations. As microﬂares last about 10 minutes, it was es-
sential to obtain an XRT cadence of about a minute, which
was obtained with a reduced FOV and the use of two ﬁlters.
In many instances, the automatic exposure control (AEC), a
safety measure for the instrument, was too slow to reduce the
exposures, and the XRT images during the peak of the mi-
croﬂares were saturated (the standard AEC works relatively
well for larger ﬂares, as they have a longer duration). One
observation which we could use for analysis was the ﬂare on

Apr 9, produced by AR 12759, where XRT used the Al-poly
and Be-thin ﬁlters.

2.3. Hinode EIS

For each XSM ﬂare we searched for available EIS obser-
vations,but found none. However, there is an excellent set of
observations of AR 12759 during its disk crossing, allowing
us to check the active region evolution.

To process EIS data, we used custom-written software
which mostly follows the standard SolarSoft programs, with
the exception that the bias is subtracted while doing the line
ﬁtting, and the particle hits are removed by averaging proce-
dures along the slit direction.

The main issue we faced in the analysis is related to the EIS
radiometric calibration, and its variations in time and wave-
length. Del Zanna (2013b) presented a signiﬁcant revision
of the ground calibration, with an additional time-dependent
decrease in the sensitivty of the long-wavelength channel,
however this was only valid until 2012, and indicated that
further wavelength-dependent corrections with time would
eventually be needed. A long-term programme was therefore
started to analyse data after 2013 and provide a new radio-
metric calibration. The preliminary results of this study (Del

are provided in the Appendix.

2.4. SDO/AIA

As EIS did not observe the ﬂare on April 9, we used SDO
AIA data to study the thermal structure of the ﬂare. We have
used Mark Cheung’s Differential Emission Measure (DEM)
code (Cheung et al. 2015). As input we used averaged im-
ages over 36 s (images at 3 consecutive times) from the six
EUV AIA channels (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335 Å) to derive
EM maps. We took a minimum log T [K] = 5.7 and 13 tem-
perature bins of width 0.1 dex. The SDO/AIA response func-
tions were calculated using CHIANTI version 10 considering
a constant pressure of 1015 cm−3 K and chosen abundances.

We used the effective areas with the estimated degradation
in the various channels as available within SolarSoft, noting
that such degradation was extrapolated from the last calibra-
tion sounding rocket ﬂight which ﬂew in 2018. Hence, some
additional uncertainty is present.

3. RESULTS

3.1. EIS results for the quiescent AR core

Hinode EIS observed AR 12759 during its disk crossing
with several studies. We analysed the ATLAS_60 spectra,
obtained with 60 s exposures on Apr 1,4, and 8 to obtain
the DEM and the FIP effect in the AR core. There was no
signiﬁcant variability in the AR core during these three ob-
servations, as seen in the XSM light curves (cf Fig. 1, bottom

Note that sulphur has a FIP of 10 eV, but can be used as a
proxy for the high-FIP elements. In fact, in remote-sensing
observations its variations are in line with those of the high-
FIP elements. The sulphur EIS lines are strong and cover
a wide temperature range, as are the iron lines, so the Fe/S
results are more accurate than Ar/Fe. A few weak lines from
other elements (e.g. K, P, Al) are also present and conﬁrm

well as the calibrated intensities. It also indicates Tmax, the
temperature where the line contribution function G(T ) has a

plots) and as observed from XRT. For each observation, we
selected an AR core region using the intensity of the Fe XVI
263 Å line, as shown in Fig. 2. The ﬁgure also shows AIA
335 Å images, which are dominated in the AR core by Fe
XVI, and full-Sun XRT Be-thin images, which show that the
AR was dominating the signal from the Sun. The AIA full-
disk images were used to coalign EIS. The AR on Apr 1 was
close to the east limb, on the 4th it was close to meridian and
on the 8th it was close to the west limb.

We adopted the Del Zanna (2013a) chemical abundances,
where the FIP bias is 3.2 (low FIP elements increased com-
pared to their photospheric abundances) and used CHIANTI
v.10 to obtain DEMs. To calculate the line emissivities we
used a constant electron density of 2×109 cm−3, a typical av-
erage AR value which ﬁts the main EIS density-sensitive line
ratios. The DEM was obtained using the method described in
Del Zanna (1999), where the DEM is assumed to be a spline
function, and considering only low-FIP ions.

The DEM for Apr 1st is shown in Fig. 3. Those for Apr 4,
8 are similar and are shown in the Appendix. The plasma
distribution in temperature has two peaks, one around 1.5
MK, typical of the diffuse emission in the AR core, and one
around 3 MK, typical of the nearly isothermal hot AR core
loops. Both temperature structures have an FIP bias of about
3, as the main lines are well reproduced within 20–30% (the
uncertainty in the radiometric calibration).

Table 1 lists a small selection of the lines, showing a rela-
tively good agreement between the low FIP elements (e.g.
Fe, Si, Ca) and the high-FIP element argon. There are
several argon lines in the EIS spectra, but they are all ex-
tremely weak in AR core spectra and blended to some de-
gree, some with unknown transitions. The strongest line is

that is an average temperature more indicative of where a line
is formed.

The DEM results of the AR core regions selected for Apr
4th and Apr 8th are similar, as shown in the Appendix, al-
though the AR core on the 8th had a lower emission in the
high temperature peak. We also ﬁnd, importantly, that the
chemical abundances of the quiescent AR core do not vary,
regardless of the age and the fact that many ﬂares occurred.
This result agrees with our previous studies of several active
regions.

in the XSM spectra. The Si abundance is within 25% the
Del Zanna (2013a) AR core values. The Al abundance is
also close, while the Mg abundance as measured by XSM is
lower. We note that the relative Al and Si abundances were
measured by Del Zanna (2013a) using lines formed at lower
temperatures, between 1 and 1.5 MK, while the Mg abun-
dance was estimated by assuming the same increase over the
photospheric value as Si (the Mg lines in the EIS spectra are
formed at much lower temperatures). Del Zanna (2013a) es-
timated the absolute abundances assuming a unitary ﬁlling
factor and measuring the path length of an AR core loop, so
the agreement with the XSM result is remarkable.

3.3. XRT temperatures and EIS / XRT cross-calibration

We have analysed several XRT observations of the AR
(at non-ﬂaring times), and found consistently that the Be-
thin/Al-Poly ﬁlter ratio has a value around 0.13 in the AR
core. This value is equivalent to a temperature of about 2
MK, signiﬁcantly lower than the 3 MK measured by XSM.
Also, as shown below, the isothermal temperatures obtained
from this XRT ﬁlter ratio are signiﬁcantly lower than those
measured by XSM during the B-class ﬂare.

We initially thought that this discrepancy could be due

eral reports in the literature about a discrepancy between
the estimated and measured XRT count rates (see, e.g.
Mitra-Kraev & Del Zanna 2019, and references therein), but
not on possible problems in the relative calibration of the two
channels.

We also know that a leakage of visible light in some of
the ﬁlters can signiﬁcantly affect some ﬁlter ratios (but not
the Be-thin). Currently, it is possible to correct for this leak-
age by subtracting specially selected calibration images from
full-frames, but not for partial frames. Also, the leakage can
be more pronounced in partial frames. So, we ﬁrst checked

(red and blue points with error-bars), together with the best ﬁt
model spectrum (red and blue solid lines) and the background signal
(grey). The lower panel shows the residuals between observations
and best ﬁt model.

To measure the absolute FIP effect in the AR core, we have
analyzed the XSM spectra of the quiescent AR on April 1
from 02:29:27 UT to 02:51:03 UT, and April 4 from 09:30:11
UT to 09:53:49 UT, the timings of the EIS core observa-
tions. Due to the presence of the single AR on the solar disk,
the XSM X-ray emission during this time was dominated by
the AR core emission. We have ﬁtted the XSM spectra with
a single temperature model by considering the temperature,
EM, and the abundances of Mg, Al and Si as a free param-
eters. Figure 4 shows the XSM best ﬁt model spectra (red
and blue solid lined) along with the observed ones (red and
blue points). The best ﬁtted parameters along with the 1-
σ error-bars are given in Table 2. The isothermal tempera-
ture of 3 MK agrees with the peak in the DEM as measured
by Hinode EIS. The absolute abundances of Mg, Al and Si

Al-Poly full-disk calibration data, which is essentially a ﬂat
ﬁeld, and found that the variations between the center and
the edges of the FOV are within a few DN/s, hence are neg-
ligible. Then we analysed several full-frame XRT synoptic
datasets, and obtained isothermal temperatures for the AR
core. The central part of the AR core is generally satu-
rated in the synoptic observations (either in the Al-Poly or
the Be-thin), except the 1s exposures, where the signal is of-
ten low, so combined images with different exposures need
to be used. The full-disk ﬁlter ratios consistently indicate a
temperature of 2 MK, i.e. the same as that obtained from the
partial-frame ﬁlter ratios. We therefore conclude that leakage
of visible light does not affect the partial frame Be-thin/Al-
Poly observations of this active region.

thin image of the AR core. The selected box was used to obtain
a DEM from EIS and averaged signal in the XRT ﬁlters. Bottom:
isothermal temperature (MK) map in the box region, obtained from
the Be-thin/Al-Poly ﬁlter ratio.

To investigate this issue further, we analysed the XRT ob-
servations on April 8 and performed a cross-calibration with
EIS. A detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison is difﬁcult, as the
two instruments have different spatial and temporal resolu-
tions, and as the EIS jitter is difﬁcult to quantify. So we opted
for an overall cross-calibration of the whole AR core. We
co-aligned the XRT images against EIS/AIA. Three Be-thin
averaged frames around 10 UT are shown in Fig. 5 (top).

We then obtained from the Be-thin/Al-Poly ﬁlter ratio the
isothermal temperature map in the AR core region (box),
shown in Fig. 5 (bottom). The averaged temperature is 2
MK. The averaged XRT signal in the AR core in each of the
two ﬁlters changed by only a few percent during the EIS ob-
servation. The averaged values are 31.6 DN/s in the Be-thin
and 233.2 in the Al-Poly, resulting in a ratio of 0.136. The
ratio varied between 0.133 and 0.139 during the EIS scan of
the AR core.

As we have a relatively reliable EIS absolute calibration,
we can predict the averaged AR core signal in the two XRT
ﬁlters. The main issue here is the chemical abundance of the
elements. Having conﬁrmed from the EIS and XSM analy-
sis that the Ar, S, Si, Fe abundances are consistent with the
Del Zanna (2013a) abundances, indicating an FIP effect of
3.2, we have assumed that the abundances of the other ele-
ments contributing to the XRT bands (mainly O, Ne) follow
the same trend, which is consistent to the X-ray results ob-
tained by Del Zanna & Mason (2014).

We used the DEM obtained from EIS, which has two
peaks, one around 1.8 MK and one around 2.5 MK, and cal-
culated the XRT signal using the current knowledge of the
XRT effective areas as available in SolarSoft. We obtained
the simulated spectra shown in the Appendix and an averaged
value of 25 DN/s in the Be-thin and 196 in the Al-Poly, re-
sulting in a ratio of 0.128, i.e. only 6% lower than observed,
and corresponding to an isothermal temperature of 2 MK.
The absolute DN/s are also very close, within 26 and 19%,
which is a remarkable result, considering the uncertainty in
the calibration of the instruments and in the chemical abun-
dances.

In conclusion, the lower isothermal temperatures obtained
for the AR core by the XRT Be-thin/Al-Poly ﬁlter ratio are
simply due to the fact that the Al-Poly is sensitive to low
temperatures, so the isothermal temperature has a signiﬁcant
contribution from the peak in the emission measure around
1.8 MK.

3.4. The 9:15 UT ﬂare

The AR produced a B-class ﬂare which started around 9:00
UT and ﬁnished by 9:50 UT. Fig. 6 shows a selection of XRT
images and corresponding isothermal temperatures obtained
from the Be-thin/Al-Poly ﬁlter ratio. The two ﬁlters had ex-
posures within a few seconds, but several images were satu-
rated and were discarded. The ﬂare started with an activation
of a ﬁlament and a compact X-ray emission. Later on, many
ﬂare loops became activated and occupied a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the AR core, reaching peak X-ray intensity around
9:15 UT.

From the XRT ﬁlter ratio we have also obtained the emis-
sion measure for each pixel. We have then obtained averaged
temperatures for the whole AR, weighted by the EM values,

images. Hot emission is visible in the AIA 94 Å band, due
to Fe XVIII, as described in Del Zanna (2013a). Note that the
ﬁlament is still visible in absorption at this wavelengths, but
not in the XRT X-ray images. It is clear from inspection of
the other AIA channels that this ﬂare did not reach temper-
atures above 10 MK, otherwise the Fe XXI line would have
contributed to the 131 Å band.

To obtain a DEM from the AIA data it is necessary to adopt
a set of chemical abundances. Note that the AIA bands are
dominated by Fe lines, while the XRT ﬁlters have contribu-
tions from Fe, Ne, O, Mg, and other elements. XSM can reli-
ably measure the Si abundance, but also provides abundances
for other elements. We performed an analysis of the XSM
spectra around 9:12 UT and from the line to continuum we
obtained for Si, Mg, Al, and S, the following absolute abun-
dances: 7.7, 7.5, 6.5, and 7.1 dex. The Mg, Al, and S are
close to the photospheric values, while the Si abundance is
between photospheric (7.51 dex) and the Del Zanna (2013a)
coronal value (8.0 dex). We used these values for the DEM
analysis.

intermediate FIP fractionation which is close to the results
obtained from the low-FIP Si and the mid-FIP S, used as a
proxy for the high-FIP elements. For example, the Fe hybrid
abundance is 7.83 dex (i.e. between the photospheric value
of 7.50 and the coronal value of 8.0 dex, as Si), and the O,
Ne hybrid abundances are actually close to the photospheric
values recommended by Asplund et al. (2009).

The resulting column EM values for a range of tempera-
tures are shown in Fig. 8 (bottom). We note that the high
temperatures are not well constrained, as the only hot channel
with signal was the AIA 94 Å. For this reason, the maximum
temperature for the inversion was set to log T [K]=6.9.

From the column EM values we calculated a volume EM
by averaging the emission measures over the core of the mi-
croﬂare, in a region covering 100 * 50 pixels in the x and y

to be compared to the isothermal temperatures obtained from
the spectral ﬁtting of XSM. The XSM spectra were binned in
time to increase the signal to noise. The results are shown
in Fig. 7. XSM indicates a peak temperature of nearly 6
MK, while the peak temperature from XRT is much lower,
although the variations are similar. We have veriﬁed that
the X-ray signal from the AR is dominating over that from
the whole Sun, looking at the full-Sun X-ray Be-thin images.
Therefore, the XRT temperatures should be directly compa-
rable to those of XSM.

We note that ﬁtting the XSM spectra with a two tempera-
ture component (one for the quiescent AR core emission and
one for the ﬂare emission) would result in a slightly higher
ﬂare component, and the discrepancy would remain.

As the isothermal assumption is clearly an approximation
for both the XSM and XRT datasets, we have explored the ef-
fects that a DEM distribution has for this ﬂare. We selected a
time close to the peak, at 9:12 UT, and obtained a DEM from
the six AIA coronal images. We averaged the AIA data over
a minute around 9:12 UT. Fig. 8 (top) shows the AIA EUV

direction, respectively. The resulting volume EM is shown
in Fig. 9. We then used this volume EM to predict the XSM
spectrum, which is shown, together with the observed one, in
Fig. 10. There is excellent agreement between the two, indi-
cating a reliable cross-calibration between AIA and XSM.

We then preformed forward modelling of the XRT signal,
using the same EM and chemical abundances. We obtained
222 and 1019 DN/s for the Be-thin and Al-Poly ﬁlters, re-
spectively. This results in a ratio of 0.22, equivalent to an

isothermal temperature of 4 MK, nearly the same value ob-
tained from the ﬁlter ratio. We note that adopting a very
different set of chemical abundances does not change the
result. In fact, with the photospheric values recommended
by Asplund et al. (2009) or with the Feldman (1992) coronal
values we obtain a ratio of 0.23, i.e. still 4 MK.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

After a multi-wavelength survey of dozens of microﬂares
and B-class ﬂares during the ﬁrst period of operation of the
XSM monitor, it became clear how difﬁcult it is to obtain
reliable measurements of these weak, fast evolving events.
XSM X-ray spectra have been great at providing an overview
of how common microﬂares are in AR cores (even though
many small heating events also occur outside ARs). Given
its medium resolution, a multi-temperature analysis is difﬁ-
cult. However, the instrument has the great capability to mea-
sure the absolute chemical abundances for ﬂares of B-class or
above.

Trying to catch a ﬂare with a slit spectrometer such as EIS
is notoriously difﬁcult, especially for microﬂares, as they
only last 10 minutes or so. The information that can be
telemetered is also limited, so are the diagnostics. On the
basis of the present analysis, we developed and tested new
EIS observing sequences for additional diagnostics.

During the multi-wavelength campaign, we also learned
how to adjust the AEC to avoid saturation in the XRT ﬁlters
as much as possible. On the basis of the present analysis,
we have run new XRT observing sequences with different
ﬁlters, as the Be-thin/Al-Poly provides isothermal tempera-
tures which are much lower than the peak values. With a
direct comparison between simultaneous EIS and XRT ob-
servations we were able to explain this result, due to the sen-
sitivity of the Al-Poly ﬁlter to lower temperatures. The im-
proved XRT observations will be discussed in a following
paper.

One important result of our analysis regards the quiescent
AR core emission during its disk crossing, which was found
to have a distribution of temperatures and chemical abun-
dances that did not change signiﬁcantly over time. The XRT,
EIS and XSM observations were all consistent with each
other.

Most of the emission in the AR core was around 1.5 and
3 MK. As the XSM signal was dominated by the AR core,
we were also able to obtain another result: the XSM spec-
tra during quiescence indicate a FIP bias of about 2.5±0.2,
adopting the silicon value. This result is important, as pre-
vious measurements did not clearly assess if it was the low-
FIP elements that are enhanced in AR cores or the high-FIP
ones to be depleted, relative to their photospheric values. The
EIS observations indicate that the Fe/Si vs. Ar/S abundances
are increased by about a factor of about 3 over the photo-

spheric value. Combining the XSM and EIS results therefore
indicates that the argon and sulphur abundances are slightly
below their photospheric values. Such observations ﬁt the
nanoﬂare-heated scenario, where high-frequency nanoﬂares
cause this relatively steady basal heating, and the Alfven
waves excited by them cause the chemical fractionation. In
fact, in the physical model discussed by Laming et al. (2019),
a closed magnetic loop behaves as a resonant cavity, where
the waves bounce from footpoint to the other, with a travel
time that is an integral number of the wave half periods. In
such case, the ponderomotive force creates a fractionation of
the elements at the top of the chromosphere, where most of
the hydrogen is ionized, and elements with a FIP around 10
eV such as sulphur are predicted to behave as the high-FIP
elements.

In our previous study (Mondal et al. 2021), we used XSM
data to show for the ﬁrst time that chemical abundances of
low-FIP elements quickly decrease towards photospheric val-
ues in B-class ﬂares, with a return towards coronal values
during the gradual phase. AR 12759 produced many such
ﬂares during its disk crossing, but clearly such variations did
not affect the abundances of the AR core. In our previous pa-
per, we have suggested possible reasons for such abundance
variations, pointing out the need for a model to explain the
observations.

It may well be that the same physical processes (e.g. mag-
netic reconnection in the corona) heat the basal AR cores and
the ﬂare loops, but produce very different signatures: low-
energy and high-frequency nanoﬂares would slowly evapo-
rate already fractionated plasma from the top of the chro-
mosphere, while B-class ﬂares deposit their energy deeper
in the chromosphere, causing a faster evaporation of un-
fractionated plasma.

The abundance variations during a ﬂare could be used as a
diagnostic to assess if the low-energy tail of the distribution
of microﬂares is causing the basal active region heating. Ide-
ally, one would therefore want to see if also microﬂares have
similar abundance variations as B-class ﬂares. If they do, this
would be an argument in favor of microﬂares not contributing
to the basal AR core heating.

One of our aims was to provide estimates of the spatial
and temperature distribution of the ﬂare loops producing the
XSM signal using multi-wavelength observations, to com-
plement the analysis of the X-ray full-Sun spectra. The in-
formation on the spatial distribution is provided by the AIA
and XRT, but the temperature distribution turned out to be
difﬁcult to estimate. The AIA analysis was limited, with only
one hot band responding to the ﬂare (the 94 Å). Assuming a
continuous multi-thermal emission, we obtained from AIA
a strong peak around 3 MK and a secondary (ﬂare) emis-
sion around 6-7 MK. The 3 MK emission is mostly back-
ground/foreground quiescent emission of the AR core. We

are encouraged by the excellent agreement between the X-ray
XSM spectra as predicted from the AIA DEM modelling and
the observed values, especially considering the uncertainty
in the AIA calibration. However, the isothermal approxi-
mation ﬁts the XSM spectra equally well to a multi-thermal
distribution. Clearly, the isothermal temperatures from the
XSM analysis are more representative of the ‘true’ peak ﬂare
temperatures than those from the XRT Be-thin/Al-Poly ﬁl-
ter ratio, as the latter has a bias towards the lower temper-
atures. However, multi-thermal emission is clearly present
and should be taken into account whenever suitable observa-
tions are available.

Better estimates of the temperature distribution can be ob-
tained from spectroscopic observations or from AIA when
temperatures well above 7 MK are present, as Fe XXI be-
comes visible in the AIA 131 Å (and also Fe XXIV in the
193 Å band). Also, the XSM spectra of higher-T ﬂares are
very different, not just in terms of slope of the continuum,
but also in terms of line emission.

In some respects we were surprised to see a low maxi-
mum temperature of about 6-7 MK from this B-class ﬂare, as
smaller ﬂares often do produce much higher temperatures, as
in the Del Zanna et al. (2011) example. In this case it is clear
that the higher GOES class is simply due to the presence of
an extended set of ﬂare loops, which ﬁts with the conclusions
on the C-class ﬂares by Bowen et al. (2013) that ﬂares with
larger volumes have lower maximum temperatures.

Further improvements on our understanding of small ﬂares
is achievable with current instrumentation and modelling, but
as we mentioned in the introduction, key new high-resolution
spectroscopic observations are needed.

APPENDIX

A. FURTHER DETAILS

Fig. 11 shows the two DEMs for the AR core observed on 2020 Apr 4 and 8 obtained from Hinode EIS, while Tables 3,4

provide the details.

Figure 11. DEM for the AR core observed on 2020 Apr 4 and 8 obtained from Hinode EIS. The points are plotted at the temperature Tmax, and
at the theoretical vs. the observed intensity ratio multiplied by the DEM value.

B. EIS CALIBRATION

A DEM analysis was applied to off-limb quiet Sun observations close in time to the observations discussed here, to obtain the
relative EIS calibration using the strongest coronal lines. The advantage is that the plasma is nearly isothermal and isodensity,
and removes from the coronal lines blending with cool lines. This is an extension of the method used by Warren et al. (2014),
where strict isothermality was assumed. The line ratio method adopted in Del Zanna (2013b) was also extended, using both quiet
Sun and Active region observations. The calibration relative to AIA was also assessed, as was AIA against SDO EVE. Further
details are given in Del Zanna and Warren (2022).

Table 3. List of emission lines from the 2020 Apr 4 active region core. λobs (Å) is the measured wavelength. DN is the number of total counts in
the line, while Iobs is the calibrated radiance (phot cm−2 s−1 arc-second−2) obtained with our new EIS calibration. Tmax and Teff are the maximum
and effective temperature (log values in K), R the ratio between the predicted and observed radiances, Ion and λexp (Å) the main contributing
line, and r the fractional contribution to the blend.
