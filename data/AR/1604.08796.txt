The influence of ambient air on the flowing afterglow of an atmospheric pressure Ar/O2 radiofrequency plasma has 
been  investigated  experimentally.  Spatially  resolved  mass  spectrometry  and  laser  induced  fluorescence  on  OH 
radicals were used to estimate the intrusion of air in between the plasma torch and the substrate as a function of 
the torch-to-substrate separation distance. No air is detected, within the limits of measurement uncertainties, for 
separation distances smaller than 5 mm. For larger distances, the effect of ambient air can no longer be neglected, 
and radial gradients in the concentrations of species appear. The Ar 4p population, determined through absolute 
optical emission spectroscopy, is seen to decrease with separation distance, whereas a rise  in emission from the 
N2(C–B) system is measured. The observed decay in Ar 4p and N2(C) populations for separation distances greater 
than 9mm is partly assigned to the increasing collisional quenching rate by N2 and O2 molecules from the entrained 
air.  Absorption  measurements  also  point  to  the  formation  of  ozone  at  concentrations  from  1014  to  1015  cm–3, 
depending both on the injected O2 flow rate and the torch-to-substrate separation distance. 

1. Introduction 

Non-equilibrium atmospheric pressure plasmas have recently created widespread interest (cf. dedicated topics in symposia on plasma 

and material science), notably for thin film deposition,1–3 surface treatment,4–6 and biomedical applications.7–9 Their attractiveness 

stems principally from both a non-reliance on elaborate vacuum technology and their low operating gas temperatures. 

The atmospheric pressure plasma under study in this paper is that of an AtomfloTM 250D plasma torch from Surfx Technologies LLC, 

commercialized for plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition1,3 and for treating polymer surfaces to increase, for instance,  their 

adhesion properties.6 The plasma is a capacitive discharge excited by a 27.12MHz radiofrequency (RF) power source. Substrates to be 

treated are placed downstream of the plasma. This creates a remote plasma operating regime where reactions occur quasi-exclusively 

between neutral reactive species and the substrate surface. Helium is normally the main feedstock gas, but this has been replaced with 

argon in this study. With the ever increasing rarity and expected rises in the price of helium, the choice to use argon has been made to 

prepare for the possibility that helium becomes less commercially attractive. 

For material processing applications, a crucial issue is the control of the reactive species impinging the substrate surface. In this context, 

the aim of this study is to quantify the effect of ambient air on the physical and chemical properties of the flowing afterglow. To that 

purpose, a characterization of the plasma afterglow as a function of the plasma torch-to-substrate separation distance is undertaken 

by  optical  diagnostics  and  mass  spectrometry.  Optical  emission  and  absorption  spectroscopy  are  employed  to  gain  insight  into  the 

variations of the Ar 4p population and the creation of new species arising from the interaction between the plasma afterglow and the 

air. Both spatially resolved mass spectrometry and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) on OH radicals are implemented to determine the 

intrusion of air in between the plasma torch and the substrate. As a follow-up to the results obtained, we propose possible mechanisms 

for the changes in the properties of the afterglow induced by air entrainment. We also show that for short torch-to-substrate separation 

distances (<5 mm), the plasma afterglow is effectively free of any contamination from the ambient air.

2. Experimental setup & Diagnostics 

2.1. Plasma source 

Figure 1 presents a schematic view of the plasma torch under study. The discharge is produced between two perforated, parallel plate 

electrodes, 2.5 cm in diameter. The upper electrode is powered at a frequency of 27.12 MHz, while the lower electrode is grounded. 

The Ar and O2 gases flow through the electrodes at rates of 30 L/min and in the range 0–30 mL/min, respectively. Additionally, precursors 

for  plasma  enhanced  chemical  vapor  deposition  can  be  fed  to  the  inlet  distributor  which  is  mounted  downstream  of  the  lower 

electrode.1 Both the distributor and the lower electrode contain 126 holes 1mm in diameter each. The bottom of the distributor acts 

as an exit grid for the plasma-precursor mixture. The  power injected in the discharge can  be set between 60W and 100 W.  All the 

experiments have been carried out a) at a fixed power of 80W. 

FIG. 1. Schematic of the plasma torch and substrate holder. 

FIG.  2.  OH  (A2+;  v’=0    X2;  v"=0)  band  integrated 

intensity versus plasma on time, with and without injected 

water vapor (Ar 30 L/min, O2 0 mL/min, 80 W, gap= 5 mm). 

A silicon substrate, cut to a rectangle of dimensions 70mm*80 mm, is placed downstream of the plasma torch, at a distance varying 

from 2mm to 13 mm. The torch-to-substrate separation distance will also be denoted as “gap” in some figures, the two terms being 

used  interchangeably.  The  surface  of  the  silicon  substrate  was  previously  etched  in  a  SF6/O2 plasma  and  appears  black  due  to  the 

presence of columnar microstructures;10 this treatment was done to decrease the reflectivity of the sample and limit the detection of 

stray light from the afterglow. 

OH radicals are easily detected in our conditions by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) through the A2+,v’=0X2,v"=0 emission 

band around 309 nm. Ar and O2 gas purities are 99.999%, and several tests lead us to conclude that the OH production mostly comes 

from water that adsorbs on the inner walls of the plasma torch when the plasma is turned off. The evolution of the emission intensity 

from excited OH (A2+), as shown in Figure 2, suggests that the OH concentration decays as the plasma on time increases. Therefore, 

for all the experiments presented in this study, water vapor is injected via the inlet distributor to allow for a better stabilization of the

OH concentration. The water vapor mass flow rate carried by Ar in the bubbling system is approximately 9mg/min, determined from 

mass measurements of the bubbler. For a total Ar flow rate of 30  L/min, this represents a concentration of water molecules of 370 

molar ppm. When no oxygen is injected in the plasma torch, one H2O molecule can give at most one OH molecule through dissociation, 

so the injected water vapor can supply a maximum OH radical density of 5-9.1015 cm–3 for gas temperatures in the range 300–460 K. 

FIG. 3. Experimental set-up for optical emission spectroscopy in the plasma afterglow. 

2.2. Optical emission spectroscopy 

OES has been performed with a Spectra Pro 2500i Acton Research spectrometer equipped with a CCD camera (Princeton digital camera 

with 400*1340 pixels). As depicted in Figure 3, light emitted by the plasma afterglow is focused by a set of two converging lenses into 

an optical fiber and sent to the entrance slit of the spectrometer. Optical emission spectra in the UV range are acquired with a 2400 

grooves/mm grating blazed at 240 nm (linear dispersion of 0.745 nm/mm at a wavelength of 254 nm). The width of the entrance slit 

being set to 10 lm, the FWHM of the Hg254nm from a mercury lamp is 3.6*10–2 nm. A 1800 grooves/mm grating blazed at 500 nm (linear 

dispersion of 0.846 nm/mm at a wavelength of 579 nm) is used for optical emission spectra in the visible–near infrared (VNIR) range. 

With the same setting of the entrance slit, the FWHM of the Hg579nm line is 4.2*10–2 nm. For measurements in the VNIR range, a yellow 

glass high-pass filter is inserted just before the optical fiber to eliminate the second order of OH and N2 band emission. 

Absolute densities of Ar excited atomic states have been determined experimentally through absolute line intensity measurements. 

Given the size of the plasma imaged, we assumed the plasma to be optically thin, i.e., possible absorption by the plasma is neglected. 

The captured flux  (W) integrated on a transition ul is given by 

where /=4 is the fraction of solid angle detected, V the emitting plasma volume (cm3), T the transmission of the optical system, Nu 

the density of atoms in the upper state (cm–3), Aul the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission (s–1), and hul the energy of the 

transition (J). 

The emitting plasma volume and solid angle of detection have been determined by injecting white light backwards from the end of the 

optical fiber and measuring the dimensions of the cone imaged at the position of the plasma afterglow. A diaphragm, 7mm in diameter, 

is located just before the lens of collection, to increase the depth of field and reduce the solid angle of detection down to 0.01 sr. The

focal point, i.e., the image of the optical fiber entrance, is 1mm in diameter. The emitting plasma volume is then approximated to be a 

cylinder of diameter 1mm and length 16 mm, corresponding to sixteen holes of the lower electrode in the line of sight. All the OES 

measurements have been carried out with the line of sight centered relative to the circular plasma torch and at an axial position centered 

at 0.5mm (the origin is the exit grid of the plasma torch). Screening by the plasma torch and/or the substrate holder is accounted for by 

calculating the ratio of the shadowed cross section to the full cross section of the cone at a known distance from the lens and dividing 

the solid angle value by this ratio. In most situations, the solid angle is reduced to about 70%. The transmittance of the lenses is assumed 

to be 96% per dioptre, hence 84.9% for the two lenses. The transmittance of the high-pass filter has been determined experimentally. 

The signal intensity measured by the CCD camera has been calibrated to an equivalent flux by using an irradiance calibrated tungsten-

halogen lamp positioned at a distance of 50 cm from the optical fiber (without any optics). The flux emitted by the lamp is calculated 

by multiplying the nominal irradiance to the surface area of the optical fiber (1.22 mm2). 

2.3. Ozone concentration measurements by absorption of mercury emission line 

An estimation of the ozone concentration in the plasma afterglow has been obtained by measuring the absorption of the Hg253,65nm 

emission line from a mercury lamp. The mercury lamp and optical fiber are positioned at opposite sides of the plasma torch. Pinholes 

of diameter 1mm are inserted right after the lamp and before the optical fiber to limit the detection of stray light. The absorption path 

length l is about 10 cm. Assuming a homogeneous concentration, the ozone concentration nO3 is determined from the measurement of 

I0, the intensity of mercury line with the plasma off, and I, when the plasma is turned on, according to the Beer-Lambert law, 

where  is the absorption cross section for ozone, which equals 1.15*10–17 cm–2 at 254 nm.11 The absorption cross sections for O2, N2, 

and H2O at this wavelength are <5*10–24 cm2, 12,13 <5*10–24 cm2,12 and <9*10–22 cm2, 14 respectively. The Hg253,65nm emission line is 

not resonant with OH absorption lines with rotational levels lower than N"=15. 15 The influence of absorption by molecular species 

other than O3 is therefore neglected. 

In our experimental conditions, other diagnostics employed suggest that the concentration of ozone is not constant along the absorption 

path length, so the values obtained should be considered as indicative only. To account for slow temporal variations in intensity of the 

mercury lamp, four series of measurements of I then I0 have been taken by switching alternatively on and off the plasma. As a result of 

the uncertainty on I=I0 and the short absorption path length, the lowest detectable number density of O3 molecules is 1014 cm–3. 

2.4. Mass spectrometry 

A quadrupolar mass spectrometer (Balzers Omnistar 300) adapted to atmospheric pressure measurements has been employed to get 

information  on  relative  concentrations  of  major  stable  species  in  the  plasma  afterglow.  The  ionization  chamber  of  the  mass 

spectrometer is evacuated to a pressure of 1-4*10–7 mbar by a turbomolecular pump assisted by a primary pump. A capillary tube, 100 

lm in internal diameter and about 1m long, is used to probe neutral species, the tip of which is positioned horizontally in between the 

plasma torch and the substrate.  To obtain maps  of concentrations, the plasma torch system is moved relative to the capillary both 

horizontally and vertically.

For  our  experiments,  the  ionization  energy  is  set  to  70  eV.  The  dynamic  range  of  measurements  is  104,  hence  only  species  with 

concentrations higher than 100 ppm can be detected. Ar, N2, O2, CO2, and H2O species have been considered for the analysis.  

The relative concentration xi of each stable species i in the plasma afterglow is calculated using the relationship, 

where Impi is the intensity of the main ion peak for species I and BGmpi its background intensity. Whatever the plasma conditions and the 

plasma  torch-to-substrate  separation  distance,  a  residual  background  containing  N2,  O2,  CO2,  H2O,  F,  and  Cl  is  always  detected.  By 

inserting the capillary inside  a tube of flowing argon (purity 99.999%), this background  signal can be determined and subsequently 

subtracted.  

fi is a correction factor that allows measurements of the main ion peaks to account for isotopes and fragmentation into ions of lower 

mass. It is determined experimentally for each species i from the mass spectrum of air and is equal to  

with Ispik the intensity of a secondary ion peak for species i. Table I lists the m/z values of the main and secondary ion peaks for each 

species considered in the present analysis, along with the experimentally calculated values of the factors fi.

2.5. Laser induced fluorescence on OH radicals 

In the scope of this study, LIF experiments on OH radicals have been carried out to gain insight into their collisional environment. Figure 

4 shows the schematic of the experimental set-up for the LIF diagnostic of the plasma afterglow. The OH(A–X, 0–0) band excitation 

around  309  nm  has  been  obtained  with  a  Sirah  Cobra-Stretch  dye  laser  pumped  by  a  pulsed  Nd:YAG  laser.  The  frequency  doubled 

emission at 532 nm of the Nd:YAG laser pumps a DCM dye with methanol mixture to provide emission at around 618 nm. A second 

harmonic generator (denoted SHG in Figure 4) is then used to obtain the wavelength of 309 nm. The laser pulse duration is about 8 ns, 

the repetition rate 10 Hz, and the linewidth about 8*10–4 nm (constructor data).

FIG. 5. OH LIF excitation scan on P1(2) transition (laser energy 1.3 µJ/ 

80 W, gap 5 mm). 

The laser beam energy can be varied from 0.3 to 2 mJ/pulse. It is attenuated by a series of beamsplitters and by one or several neutral 

density  (ND)  filters  before  the  beam  is  focused  into  the  plasma  afterglow  by  a  fused  silica  spherical  lens  of  focal  length  50  cm.  A 

horizontal slit of width 2mm is inserted in front of the lens to cut 2/3 of the beam height; the laser spot at the entrance of the plasma 

afterglow region is 0.8mm high and 0.5mm wide. 

The fluorescence emitted by the OH radicals is collected by a fused silica spherical lens of focal length 6 cm and sent to a photomultiplier 

tube (PMT Hamamatsu R928) after passing trough an assembly comprised of a vertical slit of width 1mm, a narrowband interferential 

filter (center at 310 nm, FWHM 10nm) and a ND filter to prevent the PMT from saturating. The lens and vertical slit are positioned such 

that the magnification is equal to 1. Therefore, the plasma volume sampled by LIF is approximately 1mm*0.5mm*0.8mm. The signal 

detected by the PMT is recorded on an oscilloscope (Tektronics DPO3032 with a bandwidth of 300MHz and a sample rate of 2.5 Gs/s) 

and averaged over 128 laser pulses to reduce laser energy fluctuations. 

The laser pumping is set on the P1(2) transition at 308.639 nm which excites the F1(1) level of the upper OH(A2+; v’=0) vibrational state 

from the f1(2) level of the ground OH(X2P; v"=0) vibrational state. Other levels in the v’=0 state may be populated by collision induced 

rotational energy transfer (RET). Broadband fluorescence on the (0–0) band is then detected. The choice of the pumping wavelength 

was motivated by the low lying energy of the pumped level; hence, it is one of the highest populated levels in the X2; v"=0 state. 

Furthermore, the transition is isolated and the wavelength is in the acceptable range of the laser dye. Figure 5 shows the excitation scan 

on the P1(2) transition for a laser energy of 1.3 µJ/pulse, and the time-integrated LIF signal intensity at the center of the P1(2) transition 

versus the laser pulse energy. A linear relationship is verified for laser energy up to 1.4 µJ/pulse, therefore, all the experiments have 

been carried out at an energy around 1.3 µJ/pulse. 

The v"=0v’=0 excitation scheme has been widely used for OH detection in flames16–18 and in the troposphere.19 Since the method 

employs the same bands for excitation and detection, it can induce experimental uncertainties due to Rayleigh scattering of the laser 

beam  and  possible  reabsorption  of  fluorescence.  Nonetheless,  the  excited  vibrational  state  can  only  decay  through  radiative  de-

excitation or collision induced electronic quenching, which makes it easier than schemes with excitation of v’=1 (Refs. 20–22) or v’=3 

(Refs. 23 and 24) (where the excited vibrational state can also decay through collision to lower lying vibrational states in A2+ before 

fluorescence occurs) for measuring the quenching rate and estimating the concentration of collision partners. 

3. Results 

3.1. Plasma emission 

The absolute densities of Ar excited states have been determined close to the exit grid of the plasma torch (axial position 0.5 mm, with 

a spatial resolution of 1 mm) through OES measurements, for a varying torch-to-substrate separation distance. Most of the detected 

emission is in the 690-1050 nm range, corresponding to transitions that originate from Ar 4p states (12.5–13.5 eV). Minor emission lines 

are detected from higher excited states, namely, the 4d (14.7 eV) and the 5p states (14.5 eV), and no ionic lines are visible. 

An Ar excitation temperature, T13, is then derived from the calculation of the Ar ground state density (level 1) and from the measured 

Ar 4p states density (denoted as level 3, the level 2 corresponding to the Ar 4s atomic states, which are either metastable states or 

resonant states emitting in the vacuum ultraviolet region). Because of the energy difference between the ground state and the 4 p 

states, this method is more accurate than comparing only excited state densities to obtain an excitation temperature in non-equilibrium 

plasmas.25 A collisional radiative model is then needed to convert the estimated temperature T13 to an electron temperature, which is 

beyond the scope of this study. Variations in T13 only are presented and give a measure of the evolution of the whole Ar 4 p population. 

The Ar ground state density n1 is obtained from the ideal gas law, P=n1kTgas, where P is 1 bar and Tgas is estimated by the OH(A2+; v’=0) 

rotational temperature. This equation is used assuming that the population of the Ar ground state is much greater than that of any 

other  species  in  the  plasma  afterglow.  To  obtain  the  OH(A)  rotational  temperature,  the  OH  (A–X,  0–0)  band  emission  is  fitted  to 

simulated spectra using the software LIFBASE.15 For plasmas ignited in Ar with added water vapor, Trot is always found in the 400–

450K range. 

The  use  of  excited  OH(A)  rotational  temperature  to  estimate  the  gas  temperature  in  plasmas  has  been  discussed  in  various 

publications.26–29 In order to assume that both temperatures are equal, the OH(A) rotational population must follow a Boltzmann 

distribution at the translational temperature of neutral species, i.e., a thermalized distribution. This is only possible if the OH(A2+; v’=0) 

state is directly created with a thermalized rotational population distribution or if the state can relax to a thermalized one by RET before 

deexcitation by emission or electronic quenching occurs. OH(A) radicals can be produced efficiently by collisions of H2O molecules with 

metastable Ar atoms.30,31 A three-step dissociative excitation mechanism is proposed in Ref. 31, where OH(X), and OH(A) radicals at 

high rotational levels (with a maximum at N’=10–11) are the main products. Dissociative excitation of H2O molecules by electron impact 

is another channel to produce OH(A) radicals, this requires electrons of energies greater than 9 eV.32 As it will be detailed in Sec. IIID, 

RET through collisions with argon atoms is very efficient, and for most cases the effective lifetime of OH(A2+; v’=0) state is greater than 

the RET time constant by at least an order of magnitude, so we will consider that the state is in thermal equilibrium. A further check on 

the  rotationally  resolved  OH(A–X,  0–0)  emission  spectrum  indeed  reveals  a  slight  overpopulation  of  rotational  levels  N’=10–18. 

However, their overall population does not exceed 3%, and the v2 error on the fit is not significantly improved by changing from a pure

Boltzmann distribution to a modified distribution. Therefore, the OH(A) rotational temperature should provide a good estimation of the 

gas temperature, Tgas, close to the exit grid of the plasma torch.   

The inset in Figure 6 illustrates the determination of T13 from a semi-logarithmic plot of N/g, the argon electronic state populations 

divided by the respective level degeneracies, versus the level energies E. The slope of the linear regression between the Ar 4s state and 

the 4p states is -1/kT13 (k is the Boltzmann constant). The uncertainty on T13, reported as error bars on the values of Figure 6, is calculated 

from the standard deviation of the slope of the linear regression. It should be noted that the 4p state densities measured are averages 

over the line of sight.

determination of T13. 

Calculated excitation temperatures T13 are in the range 5000–5800 K, the values being always greater when O2 is added to Ar. Most 

interestingly, a decrease in T13 is observed as the plasma torch-to-substrate distance increases, with and without O2 in the gas mixture. 

Figure  7(a)  indicates  that  a  significant  emission  from  the  second  positive  system  of  N2  is  measured  for  plasma  torch-to-substrate 

separation distances greater than 6mm. The emissivity of the N2 C3uB3g (0–2) transition around 380 nm is seen to increase with 

the plasma torch-to-substrate separation distance up to a distance of 9 mm, from which a decay is observed. The more intense N2 (C–

B, 0–0) transition around 337 nm is also detected (cf. Figure 7(b)), but the emission band overlaps another molecular band which is 

attributed  to  the  NH(A3X3–)  system.33,34  Emission  from  NH(A)  species  is  detected  for  shorter  torch-to-substrate  separation 

distances than for N2(C) species, which suggests that if N2 molecules diffuse into the afterglow, they are completely dissociated, or that 

N2 impurities are flowing with the injected Ar with water vapor mixture. Since the NH(A–X) emission intensity is much lower than that 

of N2(C–B) for a gap of 9mm and since no emission from N2(C) species is detected for small gaps, we can hypothesize that the air diffusion 

is weak in the range 2–5 mm. Evidence of this hypothesis will be given in Secs. III C and IIID.

3.2. Ozone concentration 

Measured, line averaged, ozone concentrations close to the exit grid of the plasma torch and to the substrate are shown in Figure 8(a) 

as  a  function  of  the  plasma  torch-to-substrate  separation  distance.  The  O2  flow  rate  injected  is  25mL/min.  The  lowest  detectable 

concentration is 1.1014 cm–3, therefore, the ozone concentration is significantly higher than this limit only for plasma torch-to-substrate 

separation distances greater than 8mm. It then increases as the substrate is moved further away from the plasma torch. 

The evolution of ozone concentration versus the oxygen flow rate is displayed in Figure 8(b) for a gap of 10 mm; measurements were 

carried out at axial positions 2mm and 9 mm. The ozone concentration is seen to increase with the increase in oxygen flow rate. Graphs 

(a) and (b) of Figure 8 indicate that it is both necessary to inject some oxygen in the plasma torch and to move the substrate at separation 

distances  greater  than  8mm  to  produce  ozone  at  concentrations  higher  than  the  detectable  limit.  It  is  also  noticeable  that  the 

concentrations of ozone measured close to the substrate are almost equal to those measured close to the exit grid of the plasma torch.

3.3. Ar, N2, and O2 relative concentrations by mass spectrometry 

Figure 9(a) presents Ar, O2, and N2 relative concentrations obtained from mass spectrometry measurements (H2O and CO2 molecules 

were included in the total composition) versus plasma torch-to-substrate separation distance at a radial position of 0mm and an axial 

distance of 2mm. Positioning of the metallic capillary closer to the exit grid of the plasma torch causes plasma instabilities with arcing 

effects.  At  this  location,  N2  and  O2  molecules  are  only  detected  for  gaps  greater  than  7  mm,  and  their  concentration  dramatically 

increases as the substrate is moved further away from the torch. 

In Figure 9(b), the evolution of N2 relative concentration is represented for several radial positions of measurement. This graph highlights 

the presence of radial gradients in N2 concentration for gaps larger than 6 mm. Such an effect is further illustrated in Figure 10 where 

the N2 relative concentration is plotted against the axial and radial position, for gaps of 4mm, 5mm, 7 mm, and 10 mm. For a gap of 

4mm, the N2 concentration is not significant, and for a gap of 5mm, N2 (and O2) molecules start to be detected close to the substrate 

at a radial position of 12.5 mm, their concentration reaching 2%. Then for gaps of 7mm and 10 mm, radial and axial gradients in N2 (and 

O2) are measured. For a gap of 10 mm, the N2 concentration reaches 72% at a radial position of 12.5mm and an axial position of 2 mm.

3.4. Laser induced fluorescence on OH radicals 

The air content under the plasma torch has been estimated by analyzing the decay rate of OH radicals excited by laser pumping to the 

F1(1)  level  of  the  A2+;  v’=0  vibrational  state.  The  temporal  evolution  of  the  broadband  measured  LIF  signal  ILIF  is  fitted  to  a  single 

exponential decay of the form, 

If the upper vibrational state achieves thermal equilibrium through RET before de-excitation, the effective lifetime eff of the LIF signal 

corresponds to  

with A the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, Q the total quenching rate, kx the rate constant for collisional quenching of 

OH by collider x and nx the concentration of collider x. A, Q, and kx are averaged over the whole v’=0 vibrational state. 

The  time  constant  for  rotational  relaxation  is  calculated  to  be  in  the  range  0.1–0.4  ns  according  to  Refs.  35  and  36.  Wysong  et  al. 

estimated that laser pumping of OH radicals, initially in the X2 v"=0 state at room temperature, to the N’=2 and N’=5 levels of the A2+ 

v’=0  state,  resulted  in  a  thermalized  rotational  population  distribution  in  5  Torr  of  argon  after  50  ns  and  300  ns,  respectively.37 

Extrapolating to atmospheric pressure, thermalization out of the level N’=1 should then be complete in a maximum time of 2 ns. The 

effective lifetime values are determined by fitting the temporal LIF signal to an exponential decay from 10 ns onwards after the end of 

the laser pulse. 

From the knowledge of the rate constants kx and the Einstein coefficient A, it is possible to obtain information on the concentrations of 

collision partners. A is taken as 1.45*106 s–1 from Ref. 15. Table II shows the rate constants for collisional quenching of OH(A2+; v’=0) 

by several species at a temperature of 400K (cf. Sec. IIIA).

OH (A2+; v’=0) by several species at 400 K. 

The gas composition is determined from a mixture of species coming from the plasma torch and air species. Ar and H2O are taken into 

account for the plasma gas mixture. The air composition is chosen as N2 77.18%, O2 20.71%, H2O 1.15%, Ar 0.92%, CO2 380 ppm (air 

composition at 1013 hPa, relative humidity of 50%).

Figure 11(a) presents the eff values computed from Eq. (6) while varying the air content in the 10–3% - 100% range, for several H2O 

concentrations in the plasma gas mixture. It is noticeable that the latter parameter has a strong influence on the resulting effective 

lifetime of the LIF signal for air contents lower than 1%. 

The evolution of experimental eff as a function of radial position is depicted in Figure 11(b) for several axial positions, for a plasma 

torch-to-substrate separation distance of 5 mm. It should be noted that the standard error on the exponential decay fit was always 

smaller than 1.5 ns in the higher range of eff values (and decreased down to 0.2 ns for the shorter eff values presented in Figure 11(d)) 

and was thus comprised in the limits of the square symbols. The value of eff fluctuates between 155 ns and 215 ns, and the evolution 

versus radial position is similar for the whole set of axial positions. This fluctuation is not clearly understood. It may arise from some 

scattering and reflection of the laser light on the exit grid of the plasma torch, due to the short gap. When comparing these experimental 

data to the simulation, we observe values corresponding to 0% air and spread between 200 and 350 ppm H2O in the plasma gas mixture. 

The latter value is similar to the result of computation with 0.2% air and a plasma gas mixture of Ar with 200 ppm H2O. Hence, for a 

torch-to-substrate separation distance of 5mm, the air content is limited to 0.2% whatever the radial position.  

Although we have estimated, through mass measurements of the bubbler, that the H2O concentration injected in the plasma torch is 

370 ppm on average, further determinations of the air content are achieved by comparing the experimental data to the simulation with 

Ar  and  200  ppm  H2O  in  the  plasma  gas  mixture.  Most  LIF  measurements  were  carried  out  at  a  radial  position  of  0mm,  and  these 

parameters give the best fit for a gap of 5mm, assuming a negligible air content at this location (cf. results of mass spectrometry in Sec. 

III C).  

Figure 11(c) presents the evolution of experimental eff as a function of the plasma torch-to-substrate separation distance at a radial 

position of 0mm and an axial position of 1.4 mm. The effective lifetime decreases as the substrate is moved away from the plasma torch. 

A faster decrease is observed for torch-to-substrate separation distances longer than 8 mm, the estimated air content rising from 0.1% 

for a gap of 8mm to 3%–4% for a gap of 12 mm. Qualitatively, this trend is well correlated to mass spectrometry measurements. 

When the torch-to-substrate separation distance is set to 10mm (cf. Figure 11(d)), the effective lifetime value falls as the radial position 

moves from 0 to 12.5 mm. For an  axial  position of 1.4 mm, the value of  eff stabilizes, which  again may arise from interfering with 

scattered laser light signal. For other axial  positions, the shortest eff value that can be measured is 5–10 ns. At a radial position  of 

12.5mm, the LIF signal intensity is generally too weak and eff cannot be extracted, indicating that the air content exceeds 20%. 

4. Discussion 

4.1. Air content between the plasma torch and the substrate 

Both mass spectrometry and laser induced fluorescence on OH radicals have been used for spatially resolved measurements of the air 

content  between  the  plasma  torch  and  the  substrate,  while  varying  the  torch-to-substrate  separation  distance.  Comparison  of  the 

results obtained with the two diagnostics reveals some discrepancies in the values obtained: e.g., for a gap of 10 mm, the air content

estimated by LIF is at most 1.4% and 10% at radial positions of 0mm and 6mm, respectively, while mass spectrometry measurements 

give N2 relative concentrations reaching 5% and 24%, corresponding to air contents of 6.4% and 31% for the same radial positions, 

respectively.  However,  the  relative  trends  are  similar:  the  air  concentration  is  negligible  (compared  to  lower  limit  measurement 

threshold of mass spectrometry) for gaps shorter than 5 mm, and strongly increases from gaps of 8mm onwards. Radial gradients in the 

concentrations of species then appear, which is coherent with an effect of air entrainment by the gas flowing out of the plasma torch. 

It should be recalled that mass spectrometry is an intrusive diagnostic, and that only the species which are incident on the  capillary 

entrance can be detected. The relative intensities measured are thus critically dependent on the positioning of the capillary. Moreover, 

the detector is more sensitive to ions of lower m/z ratio, which could participate to the higher N2 concentrations measured by this 

method. Finally, the relative concentrations have been calculated by considering only Ar, N2, O2, H2O, and CO2. 

Laser induced fluorescence is practically a non intrusive technique in the linear excitation regime, where the level depopulated by laser 

pumping is instantaneously refilled through RET. It allows spatially resolved measurements with the implementation of an appropriate 

optical set-up (radial resolution of 1mm and axial resolution of 0.8mm were achieved in this work). In our experimental conditions, the 

air  concentration  values  obtained  from  the  comparison  of  experimental  and  simulated  effective  lifetime  of  OH(A2+;  v’=0)  radicals 

should be more reliable than the values obtained from mass spectrometry measurements when the air content is in 1%–15% range. 

Beyond a concentration of 15%, the effective lifetime is shorter than 7 ns and the recorded LIF signal intensity is too weak. The two 

techniques employed are thus complementary for the determination of the air content over a wide range. 

4.2. Influence of ambient air on the flowing afterglow 

The air entrainment under the plasma torch strongly modifies the properties of the flowing afterglow of the Ar/O2 plasma. In the present 

study, this results in emission from N2(C) molecules being observed, the Ar excitation temperature T13 going down, and ozone molecules 

being created, provided O2 is injected in the plasma torch.  

The emergence of N2 (C–B) emission is correlated to the sharp increase in air concentration as measured by LIF and mass spectrometry. 

Possible pathways for the excitation of N2 molecules to the C3u electronic state include: electron impact excitation from lower excited 

states or from the X1g

+ ground state, energy pooling reactions between N2(A3u

+) molecules,38 cascade transitions from higher excited 

states, and collision induced energy transfer between Ar metastable atoms and N2(X1g

+) molecules.39 The electron density and Ar 

metastable concentration determined from a two-dimensional fluid model on a very similar plasma source (the excitation frequency is 

13.56 MHz, a pure Ar discharge is considered, and there is no inlet distributor under the grounded electrode) lie in the range 1010–1011 

cm–3 and 109–1010 cm–3, respectively.40 Stepwise electron impact excitation, energy pooling reactions in N2(A), and energy transfers 

between Ar metastable atoms and N2(X) molecules may contribute significantly to the population of N2(C) state.  

The rise in N2 (C–B) emission intensity with increasing plasma torch-to-substrate separation distance up to 9mm is reasonably expected 

from the rise in N2 concentration. The subsequent decrease in emission intensity for higher separation distances can be assigned to the 

increasing  collisional  quenching  rate  of  N2(C3u;  v’=0)  state  by  N2,  O2,  and  H2O  molecules  from  the  ambient  air.  The  average  rate 

constants for quenching of N2(C3u; v’=0) state by N2, O2, H2O, and Ar found in the literature are 1.14*10–11 cm3s–1,41 3.0*10–10 cm3.s–

1,42 3.9*10–10 cm3.s–1,42 and at most 3.3*10–12 cm3 s–1,43 respectively. The average radiative frequency is high (2.77*107 s–1 (Ref. 41)),

but at atmospheric pressure and at a gas temperature of 400 K, we estimate that the collisional quenching rate is already twice as high 

as the radiative frequency in an argon environment. Using the same air composition as in Sec. IIID, and a mixture of Ar with 200 ppm of 

H2O for the plasma gas composition, the estimated total quenching rate varies from 6.1*107 s–1 to 1.3*108 s–1 for a radial position of 

0mm, as the torch-to-substrate separation distance increases from 5mm to 12 mm. At a radial position of 12.5 mm, the total quenching 

rate exceeds 1.3*109 s–1 for gaps longer than 10 mm. It is therefore very likely that the progressive decay in the (averaged over the line 

of sight) concentration of N2(C) molecules for increasing torch-to-substrate separation distance above 9mm is related to their increasing 

quenching rate by N2/O2/H2O. 

The continuous decrease in Ar excitation temperature T13 (close to the exit grid of the plasma torch), hence in Ar 4 p population, with 

increasing  torch-to-substrate  separation  distance,  can  be  explained  by  a  combination  of  diminishing  Ar  concentration  due  to  air 

entrainment, and growing quenching rate of Ar 4 p states by N2 and O2 molecules (in the absence of data for collisional quenching by 

H2O molecules). 

The rate constants for quenching of Ar 4 p states by N2, O2, and Ar are, depending on the 4 p state considered, 0.3–3.5*10–10 cm3.s–1, 

4.6–7.6*10–10 cm3.s–1, and 1.2–1.6*10–11 cm3.s–1, respectively.44 In pure Ar plasma, at atmospheric pressure and T=400 K, the quenching 

rate of Ar 4 p states by Ar atoms is 2.1-2.9*108 s–1, i.e., about ten times larger than the radiative frequency (2.5–4.5*107 s–1 (Ref. 45)). 

The quenching mechanisms of the Ar 4p states by collision with Ar atoms are relaxation to other 4p states or lower 4s states, whereas 

the  quenching  mechanisms  for  collisions  with  N2  and  O2  are  excitation-transfer  reactions,44  with  Ar  atoms  decaying  back  to  the 

electronic ground state. The total quenching rate of Ar 4p states changes from 2.2–2.9*108 s–1 to 2.2-4.5*108 s–1 for a radial position of 

0mm, as the torch-to-substrate separation distance increases from 5mm to 12mm. At a radial position of 12.5 mm, the total quenching 

rate is above 0.4–4.6*109 s–1 for gaps bigger than 10 mm. 

Moreover, Ar metastable states are also quenched through excitation-transfer reactions with N2(X) molecules, leading to emission in 

the N2(C–B) system. Since the Ar 4 p states are in great part populated by electron collisions with Ar 4s atoms,46 an increase in the 

quenching rate of metastable states by N2 will in turn reduce the rate of formation of Ar 4 p states and participate in the observed decay 

in their concentration. 

Absorption measurements have revealed that, on average, ozone forms at concentrations larger than 1014 cm–3 when both the torch-

to-substrate separation distance exceeds 8mm and O2 is added to the inlet Ar gas flow. Since the ozone formation rate is controlled by 

three-body  recombination  involving  O2  and  O  species,  this  can  signify  that  the  dissociation  rate  of  O2  in  the  plasma  discharge  and 

afterglow is so high that extra O2 molecules are required to reach a detectable ozone concentration; these are brought by the entrained 

air. Another possibility is that entrained N2 molecules, excited in the afterglow to electronic states A3u

+ and B3g

+, transfer their energy 

through collisions to O2 molecules, to give rise to O atoms which then participate in reactions for ozone generation.47 Measurements 

of the absolute concentration of O radicals must be undertaken to gain insight into the reaction kinetics of ozone creation. 

4.3. Implications for surface treatment 

The  AtomfloTM  250D  plasma  source  was  designed  to  operate  in  the  open  air  for  polymer  surface  treatment  and  PECVD.  Our 

experimental results indicate that the air content in between the plasma torch and the substrate is negligible for torch-to-substrate 

separation  distances  shorter  than  5  mm.  NH(A)  molecules  have  been  detected,  but  the  absence  of  emission  in  the  N2(C–B)  system 

suggests  that  N2  molecules  are  completely  dissociated,  which  further  supports  the  conclusion  that  the  air  diffusion  is  very  weak. 

Therefore,  for  small  torch-to-substrate  separation  distances,  the  flowing  afterglow  creates  a  protective  atmosphere  above  the 
15

substrate, and the species incident at the surface are controlled by the plasma operating conditions only. When heat sensitive materials 

such  as  polyethylene  need  to  be  treated,  separation  distances  greater  than  5mm  are  often  chosen,6  the  gas  temperature  being 

approximately 400K close to the exit grid. In that case, the influence of ambient air can no longer be neglected, and radial gradients in 

the concentrations of neutral species appear, which may lead to spatial inhomogeneities for surface treatments. Furthermore,  new 

species are generated from the interaction of the flowing afterglow and the entrained air: ozone is detected at average concentrations 

higher than 1014 cm–3 when O2 is injected with Ar. Apart from O and OH radicals, which are formed in the plasma discharge region and 

the afterglow, it is highly probable that other reactive oxidative species are also created, such as NOx species. These are susceptible to 

play a role in the surface modification of polymers. 

4. Conclusion 

The influence of ambient air on the flowing afterglow of an atmospheric pressure Ar/O2 plasma (with water vapor injected downstream 

of the electrodes) has been investigated by means of optical diagnostics and mass spectrometry. Both laser induced fluorescence on 

OH radicals and mass spectrometry were implemented to determine the air content in between the plasma torch and the substrate, 

while varying the torch-to-substrate separation distance from 2mm to 12 mm. Our measurements indicate that for short separation 

distances (<5 mm), no air is detected (within the limits of measurement uncertainties), hence the nature of species incident  at  the 

substrate  surface  is  controlled  by  the  plasma  operating  conditions.  For  separation  distances  larger  than  8mm,  the  air  content 

dramatically increases, and radial gradients in the concentrations of species are measured, consistent with an effect of air entrainment 

by the gas flowing out of the plasma torch. The air entrainment induces a diminution in the Ar 4 p population, along with the appearance 

of optical emission in the N2(C–B) system. The decrease in Ar 4 p and N2(C) concentrations for separation distances larger than 9mm are 

assigned, at least in part, to the increasing rate of collisional quenching by N2 and O2 molecules from the ambient air. O3 molecules are 

also detected at concentrations higher than 1014 cm–3 for torch-to-substrate distances higher than 8 mm, provided O2 is injected with 

Ar. This result leads us to expect that other reactive oxidative species, such as NOx, are generated from the interaction of the flowing 

Ar/O2 plasma afterglow with the ambient air.
