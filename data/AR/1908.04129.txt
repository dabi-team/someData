Abstract

We call a subgraph of an edge-colored graph rainbow subgraph, if all of its edges have
diﬀerent colors. The anti-Ramsey number of a graph G in a complete graph Kn, denoted
by ar(Kn, G), is the maximum number of colors in an edge-coloring of Kn with no rainbow
subgraph copy of G. In this paper, we determine the exact value of the anti-Ramsey number
for star forests and the approximate value of the anti-Ramsey number for linear forests.
Furthermore, we compute the exact value of ar(Kn, 2P4) for n ≥ 8 and ar(Kn, Sp,q) for
large n, where Sp,q is the double star with p + q leaves.

Keywords: Anti-Ramsey number, star forest, linear forest, double star.

1. Introduction

Let G be a simple undirected graph. For x ∈ V (G), we denote the neighborhood (the set of
neighbors of x) and the degree of x in G by NG(x) and dG(x), respectively. The maximum degree
and the minimum degree of G are denoted by ∆(G) and δ(G), respectively. For ∅ 6= X ⊂ V (G),

G[X] is the subgraph of G induced by X and G−X is the subgraph of G induced by V (G)\X. If

X = {x}, then G− X will be denoted by G− x for short. Given a graph G = (V, E), for any (not
necessarily disjoint) vertex sets A, B ⊂ V , let EG(A, B) := {uv ∈ E(G)|u 6= v, u ∈ A, v ∈ B}. A
star forest is a forest whose components are stars and a linear forest is a forest whose components

are paths. We use tG and G to denote t vertex-disjoint copies and the complement of G,
respectively. Given two vertex disjoint graphs G1 and G2, we denote by G1 + G2 the join of

graphs G1 and G2, that is the graph obtained from G1 ∪ G2 by joining each vertex of G1 with
each vertex of G2.

We call a subgraph of an edge-colored graph rainbow, if all of its edges have diﬀerent colors.
Let G be a graph. The anti-Ramsey number ar(Kn, G) is the maximum number of colors in
an edge-coloring of Kn which has no rainbow copy of G. The Tur´an number ex(n, G) is the
maximum number of edges of a simple graph on n vertices without a copy of G. The anti-Ramsey

number was ﬁrst studied by Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os [6]. They showed that the anti-Ramsey

number is closely related to Tur´an number. Since then, there are plentiful results in this ﬁeld,

including cycles [1, 17], cliques [16, 19], trees [12, 13] and so on. See Fujita, Magnant and Ozeki

[7, 8] for an abundant survey. Among these results, almost the considered graphs are connected

graphs, and a few unconnected graphs are considered including matchings [4, 11], vertex-disjoint

cliques [21]. In this paper, we will consider the cases that G is a star forest or a linear forest.

We mention some of the results, which are relevant to our work.

Jiang [12] and Montellano-Ballesteros [18] independently found the anti-Ramsey number for

stars.

Simonovits and S´os [20] considered the anti-Ramsey number for paths and obtained the

following result.

Let Ωk denote the family of graphs that contain k vertex-disjoint cycles. Jin and Li [14]

computed the anti-Ramsey number for Ω2.

Theorem 3. ([14]) For any n ≥ 6, ar(Kn, Ω2) = max{2n − 2, 11}.

Later, Chen, Li and Tu [4] and independently Fujita, Kaneko, Schiermeyer and Suzuki [7]
showed that ar(Kn, tK2) = ex(n, (t − 1)K2) + 1 for n ≥ 2t + 1 ≥ 5. The values ar(K2t, tK2) =
ex(2t, (t − 1)K2) + 1 for 2 ≤ t ≤ 6 and ar(K2t, tK2) = ex(2t, (t − 1)K2) + 2 for t ≥ 7 were
determined in [4] and by Haas and Young [11], independently.

Gilboa and Roditty [9] considered the graphs with small connected components and proved
inductive results of the form “if ar(Kn, G ∪ t0Ps) ≤ f (n, t0, G) for suﬃciently large n, then
ar(Kn, G ∪ tPs) ≤ f (n, t, G) for suﬃciently large n and t ≥ t0, where s = 2 or 3.” These results
imply the following theorem.

We get the approximate value of the anti-Ramsey number for linear forests by Theorem 9

and it would be interesting to determine the exact value. Bialostocki, Gilboa and Roditty [2]
and independently Gorgol and G¨orlich [10] showed that ar(Kn, 2P3) = max{n, 7} for n ≥ 6.
Gorgol and G¨orlich showed that ar(Kn, 3P3) = 2n − 2 for n ≥ 13. In Section 4, we will use
Theorem 3 to compute the exact value of ar(Kn, 2P4) for n ≥ 8.

Theorem 10. For any n ≥ 8, ar(Kn, 2P4) = max{2n − 2, 16}.

Another motivation of this paper is the following conjecture of Gorgol and G¨orlich [10]:

Let G be a connected graph on n0 ≥ 3 vertices and t ≥ 1, then for large n,

ar(Kn, tG) = (t − 1)n −

t
2
(cid:19)

(cid:18)

+ ar(Kn−t+1, G)

if and only if G is a tree.

Statement (4) in Theorem 5(4) and Theorem 8 show that this conjecture is true for P3 and
K1,p (p ≥ 3), respectively. However, from Theorem 9, some simple calculation shows that this
conjecture fails for Pl, l ≥ 4.

Actually, for an arbitrary tree Tk with k edges, it is diﬃcult to determine the (approximate)

value of ar(Kn, Tk). Jiang and West [13] showed that for n ≥ 2k,

k − 2
2

n

(cid:23)

(cid:22)

+ O(1) ≤ ar(Kn, Tk) ≤ (k − 1)n.

The upper bound comes from the well-known bound of ex(n, Tk) ≤ (k − 1)n. Erd˝os and S´os gave
the following conjecture.

Conjecture 1.

ex(n, Tk) ≤

k − 1
2

n.

If Conjecture 1 is true (Ajtai, Koml´os, Simonovits, Szemer´edi announced it for large k),
2 n. Also, Jiang and West [13]

then the upper bound of ar(Kn, Tk) can also be reduced to k−1
conjectured that:

Conjecture 2.

ar(n, Tk) ≤

k − 2
2

n + O(1).

Notice that if Tk is a star or a path of even length, then ar(n, Tk) = k−2

2 n + O(1).

The double star Sp,q, where p ≥ q ≥ 1, is the graph consisting of the union of two stars K1,p
and K1,q together with an edge joining their centers. In Section 5, we compute the anti-Ramsey
number of double stars.

Theorem 11. For p ≥ 2, 1 ≤ q ≤ p and n ≥ 6(p2 + 2p), we have

ar(Kn, Sp,q) =

⌊ p(n−1)
2

(

⌋ + 1, q = p.

Notice that if we take Tk = Sp,p−1, then we have ar(Kn, Tk) = ⌊ k−2

2 ⌋ n

2 + O(1).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the proof of Theorem 8. The proof

of Theorem 9 will be given in Section 3. The proof of Theorem 10 will be given in Section 4.

The proof of Theorem 11 will be given in Section 5. Finally we will give a conjecture in Section

6.

Notation: Given an edge-coloring c of G, we denote the color of an edge uv by c(uv). We
denote the number of colors by |c|. For any v ∈ V (G), let C(v) := {c(vw)| w ∈ NG(v)} and
dc(v) := |C(v)|. Let H be a subgraph of G. Denote C(H) = {c(uv)| uv ∈ E(H)}. A color a is
stared (at x) if all the edges with color a induce a star K1,r (centered at the vertex x). We let
dc(v) = |{a ∈ C(v)| a is stared at v}|. A representing subgraph in an edge-coloring of Kn is a
spanning subgraph containing exactly one edge of each color. In the rest of this paper, we will
use V to denote the vertex set of Kn for short.

2. Star forests

In this Section, we use the idea of [9] to prove Theorem 8.

Theorem 8. Let F =
s = max{i : pi ≥ 2, 1 ≤ i ≤ t}. For n ≥ 3t2(p1 + 1)2,

Proof. For 1 ≤ i ≤ s, we color Kn as follows. We color Ki−1 +K n−i+1 rainbow and color Kn−i+1
with new ar(Kn−i+1, K1,pi) colors without producing a rainbow copy of K1,pi. In such way, we

use exactly (i − 1)(n − i + 1) +

Let c be any edge-coloring of Kn using f (n, F ) + 1 colors. We will ﬁnd a rainbow F by

considering the following two cases.

Claim 1. There is a rainbow copy of F − K1,p1 in Kn − v0 with respect to c′.

Proof of Claim 1. We consider the following two subcases.

Subcase 1.1 p2 ≤ 2.

In this subcase, we have F − K1,p1 = (s − 1)K1,2 ∪ (t − s)K1,1 and

f (n, F ) = max

Subcase 1.2 p2 ≥ 3.

In this subcase, we have

|c′| ≥ f (n, F ) + 1 − (n − 1) ≥ f (n − 1, F − K1,p1) + 1 = ar(Kn−1, F − K1,p1) + 1.

By induction hypothesis, there is a rainbow F − K1,p1 in Kn − v0 with respect to c′.

By Claim 1, there is a rainbow F −K1,p1 in Kn−v0 with respect to c′ (also respect to c). Since
t
dc(v0) ≥
i=1 pi+t, we are surely left with at least p1 edges, say v0w1, v0w2, . . . , v0wp1, such that
w1, w2, . . . , wp1 /∈ V (F − K1,p1) and c(v0w1), c(v0w2), . . . , c(v0wp1) /∈ {c(e)|e ∈ E(F − K1,p1)}.
By adding such p1 edges to F − K1,p1, we get a rainbow F .

obtain a rainbow F and use exactly s(n − s) +

Since we can regard the union of even paths as the subgraph of one long even path (see Corollary

1), we just need to prove the upper bound is correct for linear forest with exact one even path and
some odd paths. So we assume that F = P2s ∪ P2t1+1 ∪ P2t2+1 ∪ · · · ∪ P2tk+1, where s ≥ 1, k ≥ 1
and tk ≥ tk−1 ≥ · · · ≥ t1 ≥ 1. Let s + t1 + t2 + · · · + tk = m. In this proof, we just consider
the case s ≥ 6. The case s < 6 can be proved by the similar arguments but need to distinguish

more cases as in [20].

Consider an edge-coloring of Kn with ar(Kn, F ) colors such that there is no rainbow F .
First we take a rainbow path Pl = u1u2 . . . ul with maximum length. If l ≥ 2m + k, we can get a
rainbow F , a contradiction. By Proposition 1 and Theorem 2, ar(Kn, F ) ≥ ar(Kn, P2m−1)+1 for
large n, which implies there is a rainbow P2m−1. Hence we assume that 2m − 1 ≤ l ≤ 2m + k − 1.
Take a representing subgraph G of Kn such that Pl ⊂ G. Then |E(G)| = ar(Kn, F ). We would
partition V \ V (Pl) into three sets U1, U2 and U3 as follows:

Pl

u1 u2

ul−1 ul

U1

U2

U3

U1 is the subset of vertices of V \ V (Pl) which are not jointed to Pl at all: neither by edges

nor by paths;

U2 is the set of isolated vertices of V \ V (Pl) which are jointed to Pl by edges;

U3 = V \ (V (Pl) ∪ U1 ∪ U2).

Claim 1. |E(G[U1])| ≤ (m − 2)|U1|.

Proof of Claim 1 We ﬁrst prove that there is an P2s∪P2t1+1∪. . .∪P2tk+1 in P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1∪
P2s+2t1+...+2tk−2 by induction on k. The base case k = 1 is correct since P2s ∪ P2t1+1 ⊂
P2s+2t−1 ∪ P2s+2t1−2. Suppose the statement holds for k − 1. We divide P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1 and
P2s+2t1+...+2tk−2 respectively into two parts P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1−1, P2tk and P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1−2, P2tk .
We can ﬁnd an P2s ∪ P2t1+1 ∪ . . . ∪ P2tk−1+1 in P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1−1 ∪ P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1−2 by in-
duction hypothesis. Since (2s + 2t1 + . . . + 2tk−1 − 1) + (2s + 2t1 + . . . + 2tk−1 − 2) >
2s + (2t1 + 1) + . . . + (2tk−1 + 1), there is at least one vertex of either P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1−1 or
P2s+2t1+...+2tk−1−2 which is not used in P2s ∪ P2t1+1 ∪ . . . ∪ P2tk−1+1. Hence, we can ﬁnd an
P2s ∪ P2t1+1 ∪ . . . ∪ P2tk+1 in the original two long paths.

Since G contains no F , G[U1] contains no P2m−2 by the statement above. Thus |E(G[U1])| ≤

(m − 2)|U1| by (a).

Proof of Claim 2 It is obvious that NG(v) ⊂ V (Pl) \ {u1, ul} for all v ∈ U2. Suppose
|{v ∈ U2 : dG(v) ≥ m − 1}| ≥ (m + k)
subsets of order
m−1 in V (Pl)\{u1, ul}. By Pigeonhole Principle, there are A ⊆ V (Pl)\{u1, ul} with |A| = m−1
and B ⊆ U2 with |B| = m + k + 1 such that A ⊆ NG(v) for any v ∈ B. So there is a rainbow
Km−1,m+k+1. By adding one edge whose endpoints are in the large part of Km−1,m+k+1 to
Km−1,m+k+1, we can ﬁnd a rainbow F , a contradiction.

The following claim 3 is Lemma 1 in [20]. We include the proof for the sake of completeness.

Claim 3. |E(G[U3])| + |EG(Pl, U3)| ≤ (m − 2)|U3|.

Proof of Claim 3 Take a component H of G[U3] and denote by r the length of the longest
If H is a tree, let r = 2. By (b), we have |E(H)| ≤ r(|V (H)|−1)
. For any v ∈
cycle of H.
V (H), we can ﬁnd an Pr in H starting from it. Hence, u1, . . . , ur and ul−r+1, . . . , ul cannot
be joined to v. Otherwise, there is a rainbow Pl+1, a contradiction. For any three consecutive
vertices {ui, ui+1, ui+2}, there is no two independent edges in EG({ui, ui+1, ui+2}, V (H)) by the
maximality of Pl. Hence, we have

|E(H)| + |EG(Pl, H)| ≤

l ≤ 2m + k − 1. Since s ≥ 6, m ≥ s + k ≥ 6 + k which implies |E(G[U3])| + |EG(Pl, U3)| ≤

By Claims 1, 2 and 3, we have

4. The exact value of ar(Kn, 2P4)

In this Section, we will prove Theorem 10. We denote the complete graph on n vertices

minus one edge by K −

n . The following fact is trivial.

Fact 1. Let n ≥ 8. If there is an edge coloring of Kn using 17 colors such that there is a

rainbow K6 or K −

6 , then there is a rainbow 2P4.

We ﬁrst prove the following lemma.

Lemma 1. ar(K8, 2P4) = 16.

10

Proof. By Proposition 1 in Section 3, we just need to show the upper bound. Consider an
17-edge-coloring c of K8. Suppose there is no rainbow 2P4 in K8. By Theorem 3, there must
be a rainbow Ck ∪ Cl. Assume that k ≤ l. Then k = 3. Let T1 = C3 = x1x2x3x1 and
T2 = Cl = y1 . . . yly1. We choose a representing subgraph G such that G ⊃ T1 ∪ T2. We just
need to consider the following three cases.

Case 1. l = 5.

We claim that c(xy) ∈ C(T1 ∪ T2) for all x ∈ V (T1) and y ∈ V (T2). Otherwise, say
c(x1y1) /∈ C(T1 ∪ T2), then x2x3x1y1 ∪ y2y3y4y5 is a rainbow 2P4, a contradiction. Then the
total number of colors is at most 3 +

= 13 < 17, a contradiction.

Case 2. l = 4.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

3 = x1x2x3x1, C 2

Let the remaining vertex be z. We have c(x1z) = c(x2x3); otherwise there must be a rainbow
2P4 in T1 ∪ T2 ∪ {x1z}. Similarly, we have c(x2z) = c(x1x3) and c(x3z) = c(x1x2). Now we have
3 = zx2x3z, C 3
four rainbow C3’s: C 1
3 = zx1x3x1z. If there
are u ∈ {z, x1, x2, x3}, say u = z, and 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, say j = 1, such that c(zy1) 6= c(zy2) and
c(zy1), c(zy2) /∈ C(C 1
3 and a rainbow C5 = y1zy2y3y4y1 and
the situation is the same as Case 1. Hence we have |EG(u, T2)| ≤ 2 for any u ∈ {z, x1, x2, x3}.
= 17, which means G[V (T2)] = K4 and |EG(u, T2)| = 2 for
Then 17 = |E(G)| ≤ 3 + 4 × 2 +
any u ∈ {z, x1, x2, x3}. Thus we can ﬁnd a rainbow 2P4, a contradiction.

3 ∪ T2) then we have a rainbow C 1

(cid:0)

Case 3. l = 3.

Let the remaining vertices be z1, z2. By Case 2 and G containing no rainbow 2P4, we have
|EG({z1, z2}, T1∪T2)| ≤ 2 and then |E(G[V (T1∪T2)])| ≥ 17−2−1 = 14. Thus G[V (T1∪T2)] ∼= K6
or K −

6 and we can get a rainbow 2P4 by Fact 1, a contradiction.

Now we will complete the proof of Theorem 10.

Theorem 10. For any n ≥ 8, ar(Kn, 2P4) = max{2n − 2, 16}.

Proof. By Proposition 1, we just need to show the upper bound. We will prove it by induction

on n.

Consider an (2n − 1)-edge-coloring of Kn for n ≥ 9. Suppose there is no rainbow 2P4. By
Theorem 3, there is a rainbow Ck ∪Cl. Assume that k ≤ l. Then k = 3. Let T1 = C3 = x1x2x3x1
and T2 = Cl = y1 . . . yly1. We ﬁnish the proof by considering the following four cases.

Case 1. 4 ≤ l ≤ n − 5.

In this case, there are at least two vertices z1, z2 /∈ V (T1 ∪ T2). Since there is no rainbow
2P4, we have c(x1zi) = c(x2x3), c(x2zi) = c(x1x3) and c(x3zi) = c(x1x2) for i = 1, 2. But we
can have a rainbow 2P4 whatever the color of z1z2 is, a contradiction.

Case 2. l = n − 4.

Let V (Kn) \ V (T1 ∪ T2) = {z}. Since there is no rainbow 2P4, we have that c(x1z) = c(x2x3),
c(x2z) = c(x1x3), c(x3z) = c(x1x2), c(xy) ∈ C(T1 ∪ T2) for all x ∈ V (T1) ∪ {z} and y ∈ V (T2).
By Case 1, we can assume that c(yiyj) ∈ C(T1 ∪ T2) for all yi, yj ∈ V (T2). Hence the total

11

number of colors is at most 3 + n − 4 = n − 1 < 2n − 1, a contradiction.

Case 3. l = n − 3.

Since there is no rainbow 2P4, we have that c(xy) ∈ C(T1 ∪ T2) for all x ∈ V (T1) and
y ∈ V (T2). By Case 1 and Case 2, we can assume that c(yiyj) ∈ C(T1 ∪ T2) for all yi, yj ∈ V (T2).
Hence the total number of colors is at most 3 + n − 3 = n < 2n − 1, a contradiction.

Case 4. l = 3.

In this case we will consider the following two subcases. We choose a representing subgraph

G such that G ⊃ T1 ∪ T2.

Subcase 4.1 n = 9.
If there is a vertex v0 such that dc(v0) = 0, then K9 − v0 uses exactly 17 colors and there
is a rainbow 2P4 in K9 − v0 by Lemma 1. Hence we have dc(v) ≥ 1, for all v ∈ V (K9). Thus
δ(G) ≥ 1.

Let Z = V (K9) \ V (T1 ∪ T2) = {z1, z2, z3}. We claim that |EG(zj, Ts)| ≤ 1 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ 3
and 1 ≤ s ≤ 2. Otherwise G contains an C3 ∪ C4 and the situation is the same as Case
If there are zi ∈ Z and s ∈ {1, 2} such that |EG(zi, Ts)| = 1, then |EG(z, Tt)| = 0 for
1.
any z ∈ Z \ {zi} and t ∈ {1, 2} \ {s} by G having no 2P4.
If EG(Z, T1 ∪ T2) = ∅, then
|E(G[V (T1 ∪ T2)])| = 17 − |E(G[Z])| ≥ 17 − 3 = 14 which implies G[V (T1 ∪ T2)] ∼= K6 or K −
6 and
there is a rainbow 2P4 by Fact 1, a contradiction. Hence we have EG(Z, T1 ∪ T2) 6= ∅. Assume
z1x1 ∈ E(G) and we will consider the following two subcases.

Subcase 4.1.1 EG(Z, T2) = ∅.

Recall z1x1 ∈ E(G) and |EG(zj, T1)| ≤ 1 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ 3. If there is z ∈ {z2, z3} such that
z1z ∈ E(G), then EG({x2, x3}, T2) = ∅ which implies |E(G)| ≤ 15, a contradiction. Hence we
have |E(G[Z])| ≤ 1 and then |E(G[V (T1 ∪ T2)])| ≥ 17 − 3 = 14. Thus G[V (T1 ∪ T2)] ∼= K6 or
K −

6 and there is a rainbow 2P4 by Fact 1, a contradiction.

Subcase 4.1.2 EG(Z, T2) 6= ∅.

In this case, we have |EG(Z, T1 ∪ T2)| = |EG(z1, T1 ∪ T2)| = 2 and assume z1y1 ∈ E(G).
If EG(z1, {z2, z3}) 6= ∅, say z1z2 ∈ E(G), then EG(T1, T2) ⊆ {x1y1}. Hence |E(G)| ≤ 12, a
contradiction. So we have EG(z1, {z2, z3}) = ∅, which implies z2z3 ∈ E(G) by δ(G) ≥ 1. Thus
|E(G[V (T1 ∪ T2)])| = 17 − 3 = 14 and G[V (T1 ∪ T2)] ∼= K −
6 . We can get a rainbow 2P4 by Fact
1, a contradiction.

Subcase 4.2 n ≥ 10.
If there is a vertex v0 such that dc(v0) ≤ 2, then Kn − v0 uses 2n − 1 − dc(v0) ≥ 2n − 1 − 2 =
2(n − 1) − 1 colors and we get that Kn − v0 contains a rainbow 2P4 by induction hypothesis, a
contradiction. So we assume that dc(v) ≥ 3 for all v ∈ V (Kn). Thus δ(G) ≥ 3.

Let Z = V (Kn) \ V (T1 ∪ T2) = {z1, z2, . . . , zn−6}. Since G contains no rainbow 2P4, we have
that if there are z ∈ Z and s ∈ {1, 2} such that EG(z, Ts) 6= ∅, then EG(z′, Tt) = ∅ for any
z′ ∈ Z \ {z} and t ∈ {1, 2} \ {s}.

Subcase 4.2.1 EG(Z, T1) 6= ∅ and EG(Z, T2) 6= ∅.

12

In this case, there is exactly one vertex in Z, say z1, such that EG(z1, T1), EG(z1, T2) 6= ∅
and EG(Z \ {z1}, T1 ∪ T2) = ∅. Since dG(v) ≥ 3, G[T1 ∪ T2 ∪ {z1}] contains a cycle with length at
least 4 and G[Z \ {z1}] contains a cycle of length at least 3. Then we can have a contradiction
by Cases 1 to 3.

Subcase 4.2.2 EG(Z, T1) = ∅ or EG(Z, T2) = ∅.

Assume that EG(Z, T1) = ∅. By Case 1, we can assume that |EG(z, T2)| ≤ 1 for any z ∈ Z.
Then δ(G[Z]) ≥ 2 and there is a cycle in G[Z]. Since dG(xi) ≥ 3, we have |EG(xi, T2)| ≥ 1 for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 and there is a cycle with length at least 4 in G[T1 ∪ T2]. Then we can have a
contradiction by Cases 1 to 3.

5. Double stars

The following Lemma 2 is an extension of Theorem 1. The idea of the proof is the same as

the idea used in [12]. We include the proof for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 2. Let V (Kn) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. For 1 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ · · · ≤ pn ≤ n
3 , the maximum
number of colors of an edge-coloring of Kn such that dc(vi) ≤ pi for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n is at most

Proof. Let c be an edge-coloring of Kn such that dc(vi) ≤ pi for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let G be a
representing subgraph of Kn. Then dG(vi) ≤ dc(vi) ≤ pi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and |E(G)| = |c|. Write
V = V (G) = V (Kn). Let S = {vi ∈ V : dG(vi) = pi}. If S = ∅, then dG(vi) ≤ pi − 1 for
1 ≤ i ≤ n and hence

and we are done. Hence we may assume that S 6= ∅. For v ∈ V , let CG(v) be the set of
colors used on the edges incident to v in G. Clearly, we have CG(v) ⊂ C(v) for all v ∈ V and
CG(v) = C(v) for v ∈ S. Particularly, {c(uv)} = C(u) ∩ C(v) = CG(u) ∩ CG(v) for u, v ∈ S.

Claim 1. G[S] is a clique.

Proof of Claim 1. Let u, v ∈ S. Since c(uv) ∈ C(u) ∩ C(v) = CG(u) ∩ CG(v), uv ∈ E(G).

Hence G[S] is a clique.

Claim 2. Let u, v ∈ S and w ∈ V − S. If c(uw) = c(vw), then c(uw) = c(vw) = c(uv).

Proof of Claim 2. Since c(uw) = c(vw) ∈ C(u) ∩ C(v) = CG(u) ∩ CG(v) = {c(uv)}, we

have c(uw) = c(vw) = c(uv).

Claim 3. Let u ∈ S, v /∈ S and uv /∈ E(G). Then c(uv) /∈ CG(v).

Proof of Claim 3. Suppose c(uv) ∈ CG(v). Since u ∈ S, we have c(uv) ∈ CG(u). Hence

c(uv) ∈ CG(u) ∩ CG(v) which implies uv ∈ E(G), a contradiction.

Claim 4. For all vi /∈ S, dG(vi) ≤ pi − |S\NG(vi)|
Proof of Claim 4. Let S \ NG(vi) = {u1, u2, . . . , uk}. By Claim 3, c(ujvi) /∈ CG(vi) for
all 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Furthermore, by Claim 2, if c(ujvi) = c(ulvi), then c(uj vi) = c(ulvi) = c(ujul).

.

13

This implies that no three edges in the set {u1vi, u2vi, . . . , ukvi} have the same color; otherwise,
by Claim 1, G[S] would contain a monochromatic triangle, a contradiction. Hence at least k
2
distinct colors are used on the edges viu1, viu2, · · · , viuk, and those colors are not in CG(vi). So
|C(vi)| ≥ |CG(vi)| + k
2 ≤ pi, which
yields dG(vi) ≤ pi − k

When q = p, we color the edges of Kn as follows. We color K1,n−1 rainbow and color Kn−1 with
new ar(Kn−1, K1,p) colors without producing a rainbow K1,p. In such way, we use exactly

Let c be any edge-coloring of Kn using g(n, p, q) + 1 colors. We will ﬁnd a rainbow Sp,q by
considering the following two cases.

Case 1. There is some vertex v0 such that dc(v0) ≥ p + 2q + 1.

Let U = {v ∈ V \ {v0} : the color c(v0v) is stared at v0}. Consider the induced edge-coloring

c′ of c on Kn − v0. We have

|c′| = |C(Kn − v0)| = g(n, p, q) + 1 − dc(v0) ≥ g(n, p, q) + 1 − |U |.

Claim 1. Kn − v0 contains a rainbow K1,q with center in U or a rainbow K1,q+1 with center

in V (Kn − v0) \ U with respect to c′ (also c).

Proof of Claim 1. Suppose dc′(u) ≤ q − 1 for all u ∈ U and dc′(v) ≤ q for all v ∈

V (Kn − v0) \ U , by Lemma 2, we have

|c′| ≤

|U |(q − 1) + (n − 1 − |U |)q − (n − 1)
2

+ 1.

While |c′| ≥ g(n, p, q) + 1 − |U |, we can get |U | ≥ n, a contradiction.

By Claim 1, we get a rainbow K1,q in Kn − v0 with respect to c whose center is u0 such that
the color c(v0u0) does not present in c(K1,q). The vertex v0 is the endpoint of at least p + 2q + 1
edges with distinct colors (with respect to c). Since dc(v0) ≥ p + 2q + 1, there are at least p
edges, say v0v1, v0v2, . . . , v0vp, such that vi /∈ V (K1,q) and c(v0vi) /∈ C(K1,q) ∪ {c(v0u0)} for all
i = 1, . . . , p. So we can get a rainbow Sp,q.

Case 2. dc(v) ≤ p + 2q for all v ∈ V .

Since g(n, p, q) + 1 ≥ ar(Kn, K1,p+1) + 1, we can ﬁnd a rainbow K1,p+1. Choose some
color c0 which is not in C(K1,p+1). Consider an edge-coloring c′′ of Kn − V (K1,p+1): for e ∈
E(Kn − V (K1,p+1)), if c(e) /∈ C(K1,p+1), then c′′(e) = c(e); else c′′(e) = c0. Then

|c′| ≥ g(n, p, q) + 1 − (p + 2q)(p + 2) ≥ ar(Kn−p−2, K1,q+1) + 1.

So there is a rainbow K1,q+1 in Kn − K1,p+1 with respect to c′′ (also c). K1,q+1 has at most one
edge e with color c0. By joining the centers K1,p+1 and K1,q+1 and deleting one edge of K1,p+1
and K1,q+1 respectively, we can ﬁnd a rainbow Sp,q.

6. Open problems

A spider is a tree with at most one vertex of degree more than 2, called the center of the

spider (if no vertex of degree more than two, then any vertex can be the center). A leg of a

spider is a path from the center to a vertex of degree 1. Thus, a star with p edges is a spider of

p legs, each of length 1, and a path is a spider of 1 or 2 legs.

The number of edges in a maximum matching of a graph G is called the matching number

of G and denoted by ν(G).

Observation 1. Let p ≥ 2 and T be a spider of p legs, each of length at least 2. We have

min{ν(T − e1 − e2) : e1, e2 ∈ E(T )} ≤ min{ν(T − e) : e ∈ E(T )},

the equality holds if and only if T has exactly one leg with length even.

Let p ≥ 2 and T be a spider of p legs, each of length at least 2. Let β(T ) = min{ν(T − e) :

e ∈ E(T )}.

Proposition 2. Let p ≥ 2 and T be a spider of p legs, each of length at least 2. We have

ar(Kn, T ) ≥ (β(T ) − 1)n −

β(T )

+ r,

where r = 2 if there is exactly one leg of T with length even and r = 1 otherwise.

Proof. Let β = β(T ). We take an Kβ−1 + Kn−β+1 and color it rainbow, and use r extra colors
for all the remaining edges. Suppose there is a rainbow T in this coloring. Then T − e contains
a matching of size β for any e ∈ E(T ) (or T − e1 − e2 contains a matching of size β for any
e1, e2 ∈ E(T ) if T has exactly one leg with length even). But Kβ−1 + K n−β+1 does not contain
a matching of size β, a contradiction.

If we regard Pk+1 as a spider of 2 legs, the lower bound of Proposition 2 is sharp for p = 2
and large n by Theorem 2. We conjecture that the lower bound is sharp for p ≥ 3 and large n.

Conjecture 3. Let p ≥ 3 and T be a spider of p legs, each of length at least 2. For large n,

ar(Kn, T ) = (β(T ) − 1)n −

β(T )
