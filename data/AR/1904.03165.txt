The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter
and study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement. For this purpose we perform a two-
µB) phase diagram by varying the energy (5.1 < √sNN < 16.8/17.3
dimensional scan of the (T
GeV) and the system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) of the collisions.
In this article the NA61/SHINE results on particle spectra as well as ﬂuctuations and correlations
in p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions are presented. In particular, the latest results on
charged kaons spectra, charged pions ratios (electromagnetic effects), proton intermittency, and
anisotropic ﬂow are discussed. Finally, the motivation, NA61/SHINE plans, and the ﬁrst measure-
ments of open charm production in heavy ion collisions at the Super Proton Synchrotron energies
are shown.

1. Introduction and NA61/SHINE program

NA61/SHINE at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is a ﬁxed-target experiment pur-
suing a rich physics program including measurements for strong interactions, neutrino, and cosmic
ray physics.

Originally, for neutrino and cosmic ray programs, we planned to obtain precision data on
hadron production (spectra) as reference measurements of p+C interactions for the T2K experi-
ment for computing neutrino ﬂuxes from the T2K beam targets, and reference measurements of
p+C, π+p, p+p, and π+C interactions for cosmic-ray physics (Pierre-Auger and KASCADE ex-
periments) for improving air shower simulations. Currently, those programs are extended by h+A
measurements for the Fermilab neutrino program and analysis for experiments located in space,
namely the measurement of Nuclear Fragmentation Cross Sections (NFCS) of intermediate mass
nuclei needed to understand the propagation of cosmic rays in our Galaxy (background for dark
matter searches with space-based experiments as AMS).

The main goal of the strong interactions pro-
gram is to study the characteristics of the onset of
deconﬁnement and search for the signatures of the
critical point (CP). Presently, there are several more
projects at energies corresponding to the SPS en-
ergy range:
the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BNL,
Brookhaven), NICA (JINR, Dubna), J-PARC-HI
(J-PARC, Tokai), and SIS-100 (FAIR GSI, Darm-
stadt). NA61/SHINE is the ﬁrst experiment to per-
form a two-dimensional scan, in beam momentum
(13A–150A/158A GeV/c) and mass number (p+p,
p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) of colliding
nuclei. For the study of the properties of the on-
set of deconﬁnement we search for the onset of the
horn, kink and step [1] in collisions of light nuclei.
In order to search for the critical point we look for a non-monotonic behavior of CP signatures
such as ﬂuctuations of transverse momentum and multiplicity, intermittency, etc., when the system
freezes out close to the CP. The planned strong interactions program includes also the study of high
pT particles (energy dependence of nuclear modiﬁcation factor) in p+p and p+Pb interactions to
better understand cold nuclear matter effects at SPS energies.

Figure 1: Data sets recorded within the strong
interactions program of NA61/SHINE, and those
planned to be recorded after year 2020.

The NA61/SHINE strong interactions program is currently being extended by Pb+Pb inter-
actions.
It will allow to obtain the ﬁrst measurements of open charm production in heavy ion
collisions at SPS energies. Moreover, the anisotropic ﬂow effects, spectator-induced electromag-
netic phenomena, as well as ﬂuctuations are also planned to be measured in Pb+Pb events. The
recorded systems and those planned to be recorded in the nearest future are presented in Fig. 1,
where the size of the box is proportional to the number of recorded events.

2. Can we see the onset of deconﬁnement in light and intermediate mass systems?

The spectra and yields analyzed in NA61/SHINE allow to study the properties of the onset of
deconﬁnement by looking whether the kink, horn, and step [1] structures appear also in collisions
of small and intermediate mass nuclei. For Pb+Pb interactions the NA49 experiment reported a
sharp peak (horn) in the K+/π + ratio, which was interpreted as due to onset of deconﬁnement [2].
Additionally, a plateau (step) in the inverse slope parameter (T ) of mT spectra was also observed
as expected for constant temperature and pressure in a mixed phase. The status of horn and step
plots, as available before the CPOD 2018 conference, is presented in Fig. 2.

The recent NA61/SHINE results show that even in p+p collisions the energy dependences of
the K+/π + ratio and T exhibit rapid changes (however without a maximum for K+/π +) in the SPS
energy range. Moreover, the results for Be+Be are very close to the ones for p+p, independently of
ratio in Ar+Sc collisions
collision energy. For the currently available three energies the
lies between the values for Pb+Pb and p+p.

of NA61/SHINE results are preliminary. See Ref. [4] for references to world data.

Figure 3 shows the system size (and centrality) dependence of the K+/π + ratio at two SPS
energies. The plot conﬁrms the similarities of p+p and Be+Be collisions and clearly shows a rapid
jump from p+p and Be+Be collisions (small clusters) to the heavy Pb+Pb system (ﬁreball). The
lower panel of Fig. 3 demonstrates that the hadron resonance gas model in canonical ensemble (CE
HRG) formulation (γS = 1) cannot describe NA61/SHINE data [7].

results to predictions of the hadron resonance gas model in canonical ensemble formulation [7] (here W = A1 + A2
represents the total number of nucleons in the colliding nuclei).

The small clusters (such as p+p or Be+Be collisions) can be understood as independent, non-
statistical small objects for which the Wounded Nucleon Model works. In contrast, a ﬁreball can be
treated as a large object that decays statistically. Based on the recent NA61/SHINE p+p and Be+Be
results a new sketch of the energy – system size plot has been proposed (Fig. 4). Two onsets are
expected in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Namely, the old and known onset of deconﬁnement, where
we observe the beginning of QGP formation with increasing collision energy, and the onset of
ﬁreball, where we see the beginning of formation of a large cluster which decays statistically.
According to NA61/SHINE results the onset of ﬁreball should be located somewhere between
Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions.

For this conference the new set of results on identiﬁed particles in Be+Be collisions have been
obtained (see Ref. [8] for more details). Figure 5 shows preliminary π ±, K± and proton spectra
from the 20% most central Be+Be collisions at two selected SPS energies. Results were obtained
via the dE/dx identiﬁcation method. The new results extend the acceptance of the to f
dE/dx
identiﬁcation method to the forward hemisphere (the older to f
dE/dx results for charged kaons
can be found in Ref. [9]).

The rapidity spectra of charged kaons are presented in Fig. 7. They were obtained by com-
bining the current results from the dE/dx identiﬁcation method with the previously obtained mid-
rapidity results from the to f
dE/dx identiﬁcation method [9]. The results were reﬂected around
mid-rapidity and ﬁtted by two Gaussian functions (symmetrically displaced around mid-rapidity)
to obtain the 4π mean multiplicities of charged kaons. They are needed to draw the horn plot. Fi-
nally, symmetry between production of π + and π − was assumed when calculating the

to those observed in p+p interactions. No horn structure is observed, in contrast to the behaviour
seen in heavy Pb+Pb or Au+Au systems. It suggests that the onset of ﬁreball should be present for
collisions of nuclei heavier than beryllium.

3. Can we study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement using anisotropic ﬂow?

Directed ﬂow v1 was considered to be sensitive to the ﬁrst order phase transition (strong soft-
ening of the Equation of State) [12, 13, 14]. The expected effect was a non-monotonic behaviour
(change from positive to negative and again to positive values) of proton dv1/dy as a function of
beam energy. This effect is usually referred to as collapse of proton ﬂow. Numerical predictions for
v1 within the hydrodynamical model with and without the ﬁrst order phase transition can be found
for example in Ref. [12]. Quite a long time ago the NA49 experiment measured anti-ﬂow of protons
at mid-rapidity [15]. A negative value of dv1/dy was observed in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at
40A GeV/c beam momentum (√sNN = 8.8 GeV).

as available for the CPOD 2018 conference). Kaon and pion multiplicities in p+p data are taken from Ref. [3], the rest
of NA61/SHINE results are preliminary. See Ref. [4] for references to world data.

More recently the STAR experiment at RHIC published the energy dependence of dv1/dy at
mid-rapidity. The analysis was done for Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7
200 GeV and for dif-
ferent particle species [16, 17] (see also Refs. [18, 19] for additional STAR results on this subject).
The v1 slopes are always negative for pions, kaons, anti-protons, anti-lambdas, and φ mesons,
whereas v1 slopes for protons, Λ baryons, net-protons and net-Λ(cid:48)s change signs at lower energies
and show a minimum at √sNN = 10
20 GeV (14.5 GeV for net-protons). In fact, net-protons
and net-Λ(cid:48)s exhibit a double change of sign, from positive to negative and again to positive dv1/dy
values. Such behaviour is consistent with hydro models with a 1st order phase transition, however,
some calculations suggest that the scenario with a cross-over type transition may lead to similar
structures.

In 2018 the NA61/SHINE experiment reported the ﬁrst results on anisotropic ﬂow, measured in
centrality selected Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c beam momentum (√sNN = 7.6 GeV). According
to the horn structure in the energy dependence of the K+/π + ratio in Pb+Pb, this is the the energy
of the onset of deconﬁnement. Therefore, studying the centrality dependence of ﬂow at this speciﬁc
energy may allow to better understand the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement.

The NA61/SHINE ﬁxed target setup allows tracking and particle identiﬁcation over a wide
rapidity range. Flow coefﬁcients were measured relative to the spectator plane estimated with the
Projectile Spectator Detector1 (PSD), which is unique for NA61. Preliminary results on centrality
dependence of dv1/dy at mid-rapidity, measured in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c, are presented
in Fig. 9. One sees that the slope of pion v1 is always negative. In contrast, the slope of proton v1
changes sign for centrality of about 50%. Results for Pb+Pb at 13A and 150A GeV/c as well as six
energies of Xe+La are expected soon.

Figure 10 shows the particle type dependence of elliptic (v2) and directed ﬂow. A clear mass
hierarchy of v2 is observed which is interpreted as due to radial ﬂow2. The difference between v2

1The Projectile Spectator Detector is located on the beam axis and measures the forward energy related to the non-
interacting nucleons of the beam nucleus. In NA61/SHINE it is used to determine the centrality of A + A collisions, as
well as the spectator plane in the analysis of anisotropic ﬂow.

2Hierarchy (mass ordering) of v2 (for a given pT v2 is lower for a higher-mass particle) is qualitatively reproduced
(at lower pT ) by hydrodynamical models and understood as due to radial ﬂow. In hydro models the elliptic ﬂow follows:

The difference between v1 of π + and π − is sensitive to electromagnetic effects (see charged pions
yield asymmetry in the next section). More results and details on ﬂow analysis, as well as the new
analysis of NA49 data with respect to the spectator plane, can be found in Refs. [20, 21].

4. Can we see the electromagnetic interactions between charged pions and

spectators?

The measurement of the π +/π − ratio helps to study spectator-induced electromagnetic effects.
Spectators (in non-central collisions) follow their initial path with unchanged momenta (Fig. 11).
Charged spectators generate electromagnetic ﬁelds. Charged pion trajectories can be modiﬁed by
electromagnetic interactions (repulsion for π + and attraction for π −) with the spectators. This
effect is sensitive to the space-time evolution the system. Therefore, the π +/π − ratio allows to
study spectator-induced electromagnetic effects and brings new information on the space and time
evolution of the particle production process [22, 23].

on peripheral Pb+Pb interactions at 158A GeV/c are also shown. It can be seen that the repulsion of
π + is the strongest for pions with rapidities close to beam rapidity (spectators) and with low pT (the
minimum at the blue curve in Fig. 12, middle). This is the ﬁrst observation of spectator-induced
electromagnetic effects in small systems at the SPS energies. Qualitatively, a similar effect is seen
both in intermediate centrality Ar+Sc and in NA49 peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. A comparison of
NA61/SHINE results with models, and resulting conclusions for the space-time evolution of the
system, can be found in Ref. [25].

5. Can we contribute to understanding of the time evolution of the ﬁreball?

The analysis of short-lifetime resonances can contribute to our understanding of the time evo-
lution of high-energy nucleus-nucleus collision. It may help to distinguish between two possible
freeze-out scenarios: the sudden and the gradual one [26]. Namely, the ratio of K∗(892)0 to charged
kaon production, may allow to study the length of the time interval between chemical and kinetic
freeze-out. The lifetime of the K∗(892)0 meson (
4 fm/c) is comparable to the expected dura-
tion of the rescattering hadronic gas phase between freeze-outs. Consequently, some K∗(892)0
resonances may decay inside the ﬁreball. The momenta of their decay products can be modiﬁed

variant mass analysis. In such a case a suppression of the observed K∗(892)0 yield is expected.
Assuming no regeneration processes (Fig. 13, left), and that conditions at chemical freeze-out of
p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are the same, the time between freeze-outs can be determined [27] from

NA61/SHINE has measured K∗(892)0 meson production via its K+π − decay mode in inelas-
tic p+p collisions at beam momentum of 158 GeV/c (√sNN = 17.3 GeV). The template method
was used to extract raw K∗(892)0 signals (see Ref. [29] for details). In this method the background
(Fig. 13, right) is described as a sum of two components: mixed events and Monte Carlo gener-
ated templates which describe the contribution of K+π − pairs coming from sources other than the
K∗(892)0. For the studied resonance, the template method was found to be much more effective in
estimating the background than the standard procedure relying on mixed events only.

The double differential yields of K∗(892)0 mesons in inelastic p+p collisions at 158 GeV/c
are presented in bins of (y, pT ) in the left panel of Fig. 14. The right panel shows the pT -
extrapolated and pT -integrated rapidity spectrum of K∗(892)0 from which the 4π multiplicity can
be obtained. The preliminary value of the mean multiplicity of K∗(892)0 mesons was found to be
0.0026, where the ﬁrst uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.
0.08058
This result is similar to the NA49 measurement (0.0741
0.0067) for the same system
and energy [30], however the NA49 multiplicity was obtained for the range 0 < pT < 1.5 GeV/c
instead of 4π acceptance as in NA61/SHINE.

, and for p+p data the φ meson was excluded from the ﬁt. For p+p collisions
(cid:105)
(cid:104)
the Canonical Ensemble (CE) was used. For heavier C+C and Si+Si systems the S-Canonical En-
semble (SCE) was applied (assumes exact strangeness conservation and grand-canonical treatment
of electric charge and baryon number), and for Pb+Pb the Grand Canonical Ensemble (GCE) was
assumed4. In the another HGM calculation, described in Ref. [35], the K∗(892)0 multiplicity in
p+p collisions was obtained assuming GCE formulation and the φ meson was normally included
in the ﬁt.

Figure 15, right shows that the deviation from the HGM increases with increasing system size.
For heavier systems (including C+C and Si+Si), there is no signiﬁcant difference between ﬁt "A"
and ﬁt "B". Surprisingly, the small p+p system can be quite well described by the GCE. The CE
formulation can reproduce the K∗(892)0 multiplicities in p+p only in case of ﬁt "A", where the φ
meson is excluded from the ﬁt.

6. Can we see critical point from proton density ﬂuctuations?

An intermittency signal in protons was predicted close to the critical point. This will manifest
in local power-law ﬂuctuations of the baryon density which can be searched for by studying the
scaling behaviour of second factorial moments F2(M) with the cell size (see Fig. 16) or, equiva-
lently, with the number of cells in (px, py) space of protons at mid-rapidity (see Refs. [36, 37, 38]).
The transverse momentum space is partitioned into M
M equal-size bins, and the proton dis-
tribution is quantiﬁed by multiplicities in individual bins. The second order factorial moment in
transverse momentum space is expressed as:

×

where M2 is the number of bins (M bins in px and M bins in py) and nm is the number of protons in
the m-th bin. Combinatorial background subtracted (by mixed events) second factorial moments,
∆F2(M), should scale according to a power-law (for M

The resulting exponent (intermittency index φ2) can be compared to the theoretically expected [39]
critical value φ2 = 5/6.

In the recent analysis of NA61/SHINE [40] the intermittency effects were studied in central
Be+Be and centrality selected Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c. The dE/dx method was used for
the identiﬁcation of protons. Centrality was determined using the information on energy deposited
in the PSD detector. For Ar+Sc collisions protons were selected with at least 90% purity (see
Ref. [40] for more details and other proton purities). Figure 17 shows preliminary results on F2(M)
and ∆F2(M) of mid-rapidity protons produced in 5-10% and 10-15% central Ar+Sc collisions at

from the corresponding mean number of wounded nucleons), before comparing it to NA49 data.

150A GeV/c. In Fig. 18 preliminary NA61/SHINE Be+Be and Ar+Sc results are compared to older
NA49 results for 0-12% central ’C’+C and ’Si’+Si and 0-10% central Pb+Pb interactions [41].

The overlap of F2(M) for data and mixed events seen in NA61/SHINE Be+Be collisions and
NA49 ’C’+C and Pb+Pb interactions indicates that ∆F2(M) ﬂuctuates around zero, and suggests
that no intermittency (scaling of second order factorial moments) is observed. In contrast, an in-
dication of an intermittency effect is seen in mid-central Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c. This is
similar to the effect seen by the NA49 experiment in central ’Si’+Si collisions5 at 158A GeV/c.
The result seen in Ar+Sc collisions is a ﬁrst possible evidence of a CP signal in the NA61/SHINE
experiment. The analysis of Xe+La at 150A GeV/c, as well as Ar+Sc at 75A GeV/c has the high-
est priority in NA61/SHINE as it might strengthen the evidence for the expected non-monotonic
system size and collision energy dependence of an intermittency signal from the critical point.
Here, one could mention older intriguing results observed for intermediate mass systems at 158A
GeV/c. Namely, an intermittency signal of di-pions was seen in 158A GeV/c Si+Si interactions
by NA49 [42]. Also, the event-by-event transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations were
increased in semi-central Si+Si and C+C collisions at 158A GeV/c [43, 44] (see also next section).

7. Can we extend the critical point search by looking at the ∆η dependence of

ﬂuctuations?

NA61/SHINE uses the strongly intensive measures ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] to study transverse
momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations [45]. In the Wounded Nucleon Model (WNM) they de-
pend neither on the number of wounded nucleons (W ) nor on ﬂuctuations of W . In the Grand
Canonical Ensemble they do not depend on volume and volume ﬂuctuations. Moreover, ∆[PT , N]
and Σ[PT , N] have two reference values, namely they are equal to zero in case of no ﬂuctuations
and one in case of independent particle production.

The NA61/SHINE acceptance used in this analysis is described in Ref. [45]. Additionally, due
to poor azimuthal angle acceptance and stronger electron contamination at backward rapidities, we
limited the rapidity acceptance to 0 < yπ < ybeam, where yπ is the rapidity calculated assuming pion
mass, and ybeam is the beam rapidity.

5In NA49 intermittency analysis the fragmentation ’C’ beam was a mixture of ions with Z=6 and 7, and fragmenta-

tion ’Si’ beam was a mixture of ions with Z=13, 14, 15.

Figure 19 shows the energy dependence of ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] measured in inelastic p+p
collisions, as well as in the 0-5% most central Be+Be and Ar+Sc interactions (note that p+p and
Be+Be results were already shown by NA61/SHINE [45, 46] but in a slightly different acceptance).
Centrality was determined based on the energy measured in the PSD. The energy dependences of
the studied systems show no prominent non-monotonic behaviors that could be attributed to a CP.
The values of ∆[PT , N] smaller than 1 and Σ[PT , N] higher than 1 may be due to Bose-Einstein statis-
tics and/or anti-correlation between event transverse momentum and multiplicity (see Ref. [47] and
references therein). A growing deviation of ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] from unity (independent particle
model) with energy may be due to increasing azimuthal acceptance (for a given energy azimuthal
acceptance for p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc is the same).

Figure 19: Upper panel: ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] for all charged hadrons (h+ + h−) in inelastic p+p (grey squares),
0-5% Be+Be (red triangles), and 0-5% Ar+Sc (blue circles) collisions obtained by NA61/SHINE in the rapidity interval
0 < yπ < ybeam and with pT < 1.5 GeV/c. Only statistical uncertainties are shown. Bottom panel: similar as top but
results for negatively charged hadrons (h−). All NA61/SHINE results are preliminary.

Preliminary NA61/SHINE results have been compared to NA49 data. For the system size
dependence of Σ[PT , N] at 150A/158A GeV/c (Fig. 20, left) the NA49 [44] and NA61/SHINE data
points show consistent trends. ∆[PT , N] (not shown) is more sensitive to the width of the centrality
interval [47] and points are scattered (see Ref. [48]). So far the analysis in NA49 was restricted to
1.1 < yπ < 2.6 but in 2017 p+p, C+C and Si+Si data were reanalyzed in the acceptance currently
used by NA61/SHINE (0 < yπ < ybeam). As expected, ﬂuctuations are larger for the larger rapidity
interval (Fig. 20, right) and an increase of Σ[PT , N] from p+p to Ar+Sc/Si+Si can be observed.
It is now very important to obtain future NA61/SHINE results in Xe+La and Pb+Pb to ﬁgure out
whether a monotonic or rather non-monotonic (as seen in Fig. 20, left) dependence will be observed
in this larger rapidity window.

Now, one may want to come back to the question asked in the title of this section, namely, can
we extend the critical point search by looking at ∆η dependence of ﬂuctuations? Varying the width

tials. The ratio of anti-proton to proton multiplicities can be expressed as ¯p/p = exp(
where T is chemical freeze-out temperature and µB baryochemical potential. Rapidity spectra of
protons and anti-protons in inelastic p+p collisions at SPS energies (Fig. 21) show that the anti-
proton to proton ratio signiﬁcantly changes with rapidity. Therefore, varying the rapidity position
and/or rapidity bin width is an additional way to scan the phase diagram of strongly interacting
matter.

Figure 22 shows a sketch of the uncorrected psedorapidity spectrum of charged hadrons with

slightly different ∆η ranges were used in the analysis of Be+Be and p+p data. The corresponding
∆η dependences of transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations are presented in Fig. 23. A
non-trivial ∆[PT , N] dependence on the width ∆η of the window can be observed for p+p and Be+Be
interactions at 158/150A GeV/c. Such a behaviour is not reproduced by the EPOS model [50] and
the deviation from EPOS grows with the width of the pseudorapidity window. On the other hand,
a disagreement of data and model is not present in p+p collisions at 20 GeV/c (Be+Be interactions
at lower energies are not analyzed yet). The values and ∆η trends of Σ[PT , N] (not shown here),
studied for Be+Be at 150A GeV/c and p+p at 20–158 GeV/c, are fairly consistent with the EPOS
model predictions. More NA61/SHINE results on this subject can be found in Refs. [51, 52].

8. Future: Can we help to calibrate the QGP thermometer?

It was suggested a long time ago that the quarkonium states may serve as a quark-gluon plasma
thermometer. The melting of different states depends on the initial state temperature of the pro-
duced matter (Fig. 24). The currently available models try to describe the production rates of
charmonium states, by implementing sequential melting, regeneration effects, initial state effects,
etc.. The cross-section for charm quark production is an important parameter for the models, but
predictions of different models (Fig. 25) differ by two orders of magnitude!

Figure 24: Surviving quarkonium states for different quark-gluon plasma temperatures. Figure taken from Ref. [53].

The NA61/SHINE ﬁxed target experiment can measure

production in the full phase space.
This will be the ﬁrst time in history when such a measurement will be performed at SPS energies.
In order to estimate the average number of charm quark pairs, the yields of all the most frequently
produced charm carriers need to be known. Figure 26 presents the distribution of open charm
among different charm carriers, as obtained from the PHSD model [55, 56] for the 0-20% most
central Pb+Pb interactions at 150A GeV/c. As a ﬁrst step, NA61/SHINE will focus on D0 and D0

ondary vertex (so-called V 0) displaced from the primary interaction vertex. The average lifetime

Pb+Pb data at 150A GeV/c was recorded in 2016. The vertex ﬁt resolution is on the level of
50 µm.

Figure 28: Project (left) and photo (right) of the Small Acceptance Vertex Detector.

The ﬁrst indication of a D0 and D0 peak, observed in central Pb+Pb collisions at 150A GeV/c,
is presented in Fig. 29. The signal was obtained by matching Time Projection Chamber (TPC, see
Fig. 30, upper panel) tracks and SAVD tracks (interpolation procedures were used). The applied
cuts included longitudinal distance of the pair vertex to the primary vertex. The particle identiﬁ-
cation of V 0 products was not used yet, but in future, it should reduce the background by a factor
of 5.

Motivated by the successful reconstruction of D0 and D0 peak, the NA61/SHINE experiment
plans to perform precise measurements of charm hadron production in 2021-2024. These will
be possible with several detector upgrades (Fig. 30) foreseen during Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) at

CERN planned for 2019-2020.
The upgraded VD will be based on the same layout and mechanical support as the SAVD, but
the 16 MIMOSA-26 sensors will be replaced by 46 ALPIDE sensors developed for the ALICE-
Inner Tracking System (they produce much lower noise than MIMOSA-26 sensors). The total
active surface, 32 cm2 of the SAVD, will be replaced by 180 cm2 for the VD, resulting in larger
acceptance for each station. Finally, the time resolution of 115.2 µs (SAVD) will be improved to
10 µs (VD).

9. Can we measure high pT particles and multi-strange hadrons in NA61?

Due to limited statistics the NA49 experiment measured transverse momentum spectra of iden-
tiﬁed hadrons only up to 4 GeV/c in Pb+Pb collisions and up to 2 GeV/c in p+p interactions [62].
One of the goals of NA61/SHINE is to extend the measurements for p+p and obtain spectra in p+Pb
4 GeV/c, in order to determine the nuclear modiﬁcation factors RAA and RpA at
collisions up to
higher transverse momenta. These measurements will allow a more sensitive test for the presence
of high pT particle suppression at SPS energy.

≈

Figure 32 shows the NA61/SHINE performance results on acceptance corrected spectra of
positively and negatively charged particles at mid-rapidity in p+p and p+Pb interactions at 158
GeV/c beam momentum. A comparison of the new results with existing NA61/SHINE spectra [3,
63] of identiﬁed particles is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 32. The analysis of high pT identiﬁed
particles is in progress.

Similarly to the analysis of K∗(892)0 resonance and high pT particle spectra, a very large
statistics (approx. 60 milion of recorded events) of p+p collisions at 158 GeV/c were used to
obtain the ﬁrst NA61/SHINE results on Ξ− hyperon production. The analysis was performed in
Λπ − decay channel. Λ candidates were searched via their decays into p π − pairs. An example
invariant mass distribution of Ξ− hyperon candidates, obtained by combining Λ candidates with
π − mesons, is presented in Fig. 33. The black curve shows the ﬁtted function consisting of a
Lorentzian for the signal and a polynomial (up to 4th order) for the background. Additionally, the
signal component of the ﬁt is shown in magenta and the background as a blue line.

Preliminary results, derived from two dimensional (y, pT ) spectra, are presented as trans-
verse momentum distributions in two example bins of rapidity in the left and middle panel of
Fig. 34. Statistical uncertainties are shown as vertical bars and preliminary estimates of sys-
tematic uncertainties are indicated by shaded bands. The right panel of Fig. 34 presents the pT -
extrapolated and pT -integrated rapidity spectrum of Ξ− hyperons, from which the 4π multiplicity
can be obtained. The preliminary value of the mean multiplicity of Ξ− hyperons was found to be

10. Summary

Several new NA61/SHINE results were presented during the CPOD 2018 conference. Among
them charged pion, kaon and proton spectra in central Be+Be collisions. The energy dependencies
of K+/π + ratio and inverse slope parameter of mT spectra are similar to those in p+p collisions.
The rapidity distributions of protons conﬁrm the similarity between p+p and Be+Be collisions,
suggesting that the onset of ﬁreball is occuring for systems larger than Be+Be.

Figure 34: Left and middle: preliminary results on transverse momentum spectra (in GeV/c) of Ξ− hyperons produced
in inelastic p+p interactions at 158 GeV/c. Two selected rapidity bins are shown. Right: pT -extrapolated and pT -
integrated rapidity spectrum of Ξ− hyperons.
In both panels statistical uncertainties are shown as vertical bars and
systematic ones as shaded regions.

The ﬁrst NA61/SHINE results on anisotropic ﬂow in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c were
obtained. Proton dv1/dy changes sign for centrality of about 50%. The centrality dependence of
protons dv1/dy serves as an another tool to study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement.

We also studied the effects of electromagnetic interactions between produced pions and spec-
tators. Such an effect is clearly seen for intermediate centrality Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c
and qualitatively comparable with the effect observed by NA49 for peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at
158A GeV/c.

For this conference the ﬁrst, high precision results on K∗(892)0 production in inelastic p+p
collisions at 158 GeV/c were obtained. Combined with the data for heavier systems they can be
used to estimate time interval between chemical and kinetic freeze-out.

The most intriguing result shown by NA61/SHINE at this conference was an indication of
an intermittency effect in mid-central Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c. This is the ﬁrst possible
evidence of a critical point signal in NA61/SHINE.

We also presented the ∆η dependence of ﬂuctuations. They are studied in order to extend the
phase diagram scan. A non-trivial ∆[PT , N] dependence on the width of the ∆η window is seen for
p+p and Be+Be interactions at 158/150A GeV/c.

Moreover, we presented the prospects of open charm and high pT particle measurements in
NA61/SHINE. Finally, the analysis of multi-strange hadrons in p+p collisions is well advanced.
The ﬁrst results on Ξ− hyperon spectra are already released.
