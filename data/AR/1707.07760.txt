PROPER HOMOTOPY TYPES AND Z-BOUNDARIES OF SPACES
ADMITTING GEOMETRIC GROUP ACTIONS

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

Abstract. We extend several techniques and theorems from geometric group the-
ory so they apply to geometric actions on arbitrary proper metric ARs (absolute
retracts). Previous versions often required actions on CW complexes, manifolds,
or proper CAT(0) spaces, or else included a ﬁnite-dimensionality hypothesis. We
remove those requirements, providing proofs that simultaneously cover all of the
usual variety of spaces. A second way that we generalize earlier results is by elim-
inating a freeness requirement often placed on the group actions. In doing so, we
allow for groups with torsion.

The main theorems are new in that they generalize results found in the literature,
but a signiﬁcant aim is expository. Toward that end, brief but reasonably compre-
hensive introductions to the theories of ANRs (absolute neighborhood retracts) and
Z-sets are included, as well as a much shorter short introduction to shape theory.
Here is a sampling of the theorems proved here.

1. Introduction

In this paper all spaces are assumed separable and metrizable. A metric space
(X, d) is proper if every closed ball in X is compact. Separability is automatic for
proper metric spaces and every proper metric space is locally compact; conversely,
every locally compact space admits a proper metric.

A locally compact space X is an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) if, whenever
X is embedded as a closed subset of a space Y , some neighborhood of X in Y retracts
onto X. An ANR X is an absolute retract (AR) if, whenever X is embedded as a
closed subset of Y , its image is a retract of Y .1

One of the most signiﬁcant aspects of “ANR theory” is that it provides a common
ground for studying a variety of nice spaces: manifolds; locally ﬁnite CW (including
simplicial and cube) complexes; proper CAT(0) spaces; Hilbert cube manifolds; etc.
This is particularly useful in subjects where it is desirable to move freely between
categories.
In this paper we will generalize several theorems and techniques from
geometric group theory and metric geometry, previously restricted to one or more of
these categories, to the full spectrum of ANRs. A second way that we improve upon
known results is by extending several theorems that previously applied only to free
geometric actions. In our versions, freeness is not required, so the theorems can be
applied to groups with torsion.

For the reader with little or no experience working with abstract ANRs, we include
a short, elementary introduction to ANR theory that is suﬃcient for a complete
understanding of most of the work presented here. Indeed, a secondary goal of this
paper is to provide the reader that background, and to provide a level of comfort with
this useful category of spaces.

Here are the most notable theorems to be proved here. Versions of the ﬁrst theorem
and its corollary are well-known when X and Y are CW complexes (see [Geo08,
Ch.10]). The traditional proof is inductive over skeleta—sometimes called a “connect-
the-dots strategy.” Ours relies on a generalized version of that method, which does
not require a CW structure.

Theorem 1.1. If quasi-isometric groups G and H act geometrically on proper metric
ARs X and Y , resp., then X is proper homotopy equivalent to Y . In fact, there exist
continuous coarse equivalences f : X → Y and g : Y → X such that gf and f g are
boundedly (hence properly) homotopic to idX and idY .

The following corollary can be obtained via covering space theory and a deep result
from ANR theory (see Theorem 2.10), when the G-actions are free, and for arbitrary
CAT(0) groups by a theorem of Ontaneda [Ont05]. Our proof is more elementary
and the conclusion is more general.

Corollary 1.2. If a group G acts geometrically on proper metric ARs X and Y , then
X is proper homotopy equivalent to Y via continuous coarse equivalences f : X → Y
and g : Y → X such that gf and f g are boundedly homotopic to idX and idY .

The next collection of theorems involves “Z-boundaries” of groups—a notion intro-
duced by Bestvina and expanded upon by Dranishnikov (see §6 for deﬁnitions). The
idea is to provide an axiomatic treatment of group boundaries that includes Gromov
boundaries of hyperbolic groups and visual boundaries of CAT(0) groups, but which
can be applied more generally. Both [Bes96] and [Dra06] recognized ANR theory as
the natural setting for such a theory. In order to obtain some of his most notable con-
clusions, Bestvina worked only with ﬁnite-dimensional ANRs and torsion-free groups.
Dranishnikov relaxed those conditions, but some of Bestvina’s conclusions were then
lost. Here we extend several several theorems from [Bes96] to the more general setting
suggested in [Dra06].

PROPER HOMOTOPY TYPES AND Z-BOUNDARIES

The ﬁrst of those theorems allows “boundary swapping” when a group admits
a ﬁnite K (G, 1) complex. More generally, Bestvina asserted a boundary swapping
result for pairs of quasi-isometric groups, each of that type. We obtain generalizations
which allow non-free actions on arbitrary ARs. In addition, we prove an equivariant
version that applies to EZ-boundaries, as deﬁned by Farrell and Lafont [FL05].

Theorem 1.3 (Boundary Swapping Theorem). Suppose G acts geometrically on
proper metric ARs X and Y , and Y can be compactiﬁed to a Z-structure [resp.,
EZ-structure]
for G. Then X can be compactiﬁed, by addition of the same
X, Z
boundary, to a Z-structure [resp., EZ-structure]

for G.

For a pair of quasi-isometric groups, the EZ conclusion no longer makes sense, but

(cid:1)

the rest of Theorem 1.3 goes through as follows.

Theorem 1.4 (Generalized Boundary Swapping Theorem). Suppose quasi-isometric
groups G and H act geometrically on proper metric ARs X and Y , respectively, and
Y can be compactiﬁed to a Z-structure
for H. Then X can be compactiﬁed,
by addition of the same boundary, to a Z-structure

Remark 1. A geometric action is one that is proper, cocompact, and by isometries.
By results to be discussed in §6, it is enough to assume that the action is proper and
cocompact.

(cid:1)

It is well-known that a word hyperbolic group G has a well-deﬁned Gromov bound-
ary, but a CAT(0) group can admit non-homeomorphic visual boundaries [CK00]. A
version of well-deﬁnedness can be recovered using shape theory; one wishes to assert
that any two Z-boundaries of a group G are shape equivalent. That assertion—
implicit in [Geo86]—was made explicitly in [Bes96], for certain torsion-free groups.
Later, Ontaneda [Ont05] proved an analogous theorem, without a torsion-free hy-
pothesis, for the special case of visual boundaries of CAT(0) groups. Here we show
that all of these additional hypotheses are unnecessary.

Theorem 1.5. If quasi-isometric groups G and H admit Z-structures

up to shape equivalence.

2. Some basics of ANR theory

In this section we cover the necessary background from ANR theory. Rather than
simply quoting results from the literature, we provide a brief, elementary treatment
of the topic—including proofs of most key facts used in this paper. More complete
treatments can be found in [Hu65] or [vM89].

Recall that a locally compact space X is an an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR)
if, whenever X is embedded as a closed subset of another space Y , some neighborhood
of X retracts onto X; if the entire space Y always retracts onto X, we call X an
absolute retract (AR).

4

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

Remark 2. A ﬁnite-dimensional ANR [resp., AR] is often called a Euclidean neigh-
borhood retract (ENR) [resp. Euclidean retract (ER)]. A key aspect of this paper is
the development of techniques that do not require a restriction to this subcategory.

Some of the most important properties of A[N]Rs involve extensions of maps. In
fact, an alternative approach deﬁnes A[N]R using these very extension properties. In
that setting, they are sometimes called A[N]Es (absolute [neighborhood] extensors).
We will not use that terminology, but the following characterization is crucial.

Lemma 2.1 (Extensor characterization of ARs and ANRs ). A locally compact space
X is an AR [resp., ANR] if and only if it satisﬁes the following extension property:

(†) If A is a closed subset of an arbitrary space Y and f : A → X is continuous, then
there is a continuous extension f : Y → X [resp., a continuous extension f : U → X,
where U is a neighborhood of A in Y .].

Proof. We begin with the reverse implications. Suppose X is embedded as a closed
subset of a space Y and consider the identity map idX : X → X. By viewing the
domain copy of X as a closed subset of Y , the absolute extension property guarantees
a map f : Y → X that restricts to the identity on X, i.e., f is a retraction. If we
assume the weaker extension property, we get a retraction f : U → X.

For the forward implications, choose a proper metric d on X, let {xi}∞

i=1 ⊆ X be
a dense subset, and for each i deﬁne gi (x) = d (xi, x). Then g = (gi) embeds X as a
closed subset of R∞ (with the product topology). In what follows, view X as a closed
subset of R∞ and let j : X ֒→ R∞ be the inclusion map.

Suppose A is a closed subset of a space Y and f : A → X is continuous. By
applying the Tietze Extension Theorem coordinate-wise, extend jf : A → R∞ to a
continuous map F : Y → R∞. If X is an AR, choose a retraction r : R∞ → X and let
f = rF . If X is an ANR, choose a retraction r : V → X, where V is a neighborhood
(cid:3)
of X in R∞; then let U = F −1 (V ) and f = r F |U .
Proposition 2.2 (Homotopy Extension Property). Let A be a closed subset of a
space Y , T = (Y × {0}) ∪ A × [0, 1] and h : T → X a map into an ANR. Then there
is an extension of h to a homotopy H : Y × [0, 1] → X. If the homotopy h|A×[0,1] is
K-bounded2 and Y is locally compact, then H can be chosen to be (K + 1)-bounded.

Proof. By Lemma 2.1 there is an extension of h to h : U → X, where U is a neigh-
borhood of T in Y × [0, 1]. Let V ⊆ Y be an open neighborhood of A such that
V × [0, 1] ⊆ U, and choose a Urysohn function λ : Y → [0, 1] with λ (Y \V ) = 0 and
λ (A) = 1. Deﬁne

H (y, t) =

h (y, λ (y) · t)
h (y, 0)

if y ∈ V
if y /∈ V

(cid:26)

Now suppose h|A×[0,1] is K-bounded and Y is locally compact. Then each a ∈ A
has a compact neighborhood Na ⊆ V ; so by uniform continuity, there is an open

2Bounded homotopies are deﬁned in §4.

neighborhood Va ⊆ Na over which all tracks of h
(cid:12)
Rechoose V to be ∪a∈AVa; then H, as deﬁned above, is (K + 1)-bounded.
(cid:12)

Va×[0,1] have diameter < K + 1.
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.3. If A is a closed subset of an arbitrary space Y and f : A → X is a
null-homotopic map into an ANR, then f extends to a map f : Y → X.

Proof. Let J : A × [0, 1] → X be a homotopy with J0 (A) = {p} and J1 = f . Extend
J to a map of h : (Y × {0}) ∪ A × [0, 1] → X by sending Y × {0} to p; then apply
(cid:3)
the Homotopy Extension Property and let f = H1.

Corollary 2.4. An ANR is an AR if and only if it is contractible.

Proof. Suppose X is an AR. By the argument used in Lemma 2.1, we may assume
X is a closed subset of R∞; so by hypothesis, there is a retraction r : R∞ → X.
Composing any contraction of R∞ with r gives a contraction of X.

For the converse, assume X is contractible and X ֒→ Y is an embedding as a closed
subset of a space Y . Then idX : X → X is a null-homotopic map into an ANR, so
(cid:3)
by Corollary 2.3 it extends to a map of Y into X. That map is a retraction.

Corollary 2.5. Every open subset of an ANR is an ANR.

Proof. Let V be an open subset of an ANR X, and f : A → V a continuous map,
where A is a closed subset of a space Y . By Lemma 2.1, there is an open neighborhood
U ′ of A in Y and an extension f ′ : U ′ → X of f . Let U = U ′ ∩ (f ′)−1 (V ) and
(cid:3)
f = f ′|U .

With additional work, one can prove a similar, but diﬀerent proposition.

Proposition 2.6. A space X with the property that each x ∈ X has an open neigh-
borhood that is an ANR, is itself an ANR.

The next proposition provides a wealth of examples.

Proposition 2.7. Being an AR [ANR] is a topological property. Furthermore,

(1) [0, 1] , [0, 1), and (0, 1) are ARs,
(2) every ﬁnite product of A[N]Rs is an A[N]R,
(3) a countably inﬁnite product of ARs is an AR, provided all but ﬁnitely many

factors are compact,

(4) Every retract of an A[N]R is an A[N]R.

Proof. That these properties are invariant under homeomorphism is clear. Asser-
tion (1) follows from Lemma 2.1, Corollaries 2.4 and 2.5, and the Tietze Extension
Theorem.

For assertion (2), let A ⊆ Y be closed and f = (fi) : A →

noncompact. With those caveats, the above proof remains valid for ARs (but fails
for ANRs).

To prove assertion (4), ﬁrst recall that if r : X → X0 is a retraction, then X0 is
closed in X, so X0 is locally compact. Now suppose f : A → X0 is continuous, with
A a closed subset of a space Y . If X is an AR, there is an extension F : Y → X.
Then f = rF : Y → X0 is an extension, showing that X0 is an AR. By the same
(cid:3)
approach, if X is an ANR, then so is X0.

Recall that a space X is locally contractible at x ∈ X if every neighborhood U of
x contains a neighborhood V , such that V contracts in U. A space that is locally
contractible at each of its points is locally contractible.
Proposition 2.8. Every ANR is locally contractible and every ﬁnite-dimensional
locally compact and locally contractible space is an ANR.

Sketch of proof. It is easy to see that a retract of a locally contractible space is locally
contractible. If X is an ANR then there is an embedding X ֒→ R∞ as a closed subset
and a retraction r : U → X of an open neighborhood onto X. Since U is locally
contractible, so is X.

k ∪ X → X, where N (k)

If X is locally compact and ﬁnite-dimensional, there is a proper closed embedding
of X ֒→ Rn for some n < ∞. By Corollary 2.5 and Proposition 2.7, it suﬃces to
exhibit a retraction of some neighborhood onto X. Choose a polyhedral neighborhood
N0 of X and an inﬁnite triangulation of N0 − X that gets progressively ﬁner near X.
Deﬁne r0 : N (0)
0 ∪ X → X by sending each vertex of N − X to a nearest point in
X. Assume inductively that there is a polyhedral subneighborhood Nk of X and a
retraction rk : N (k)
is the k-skeleton of Nk − X. By the local
contractibility of X, there exists a polyhedral neighborhood Nk+1 ⊆ Nk, suﬃciently
small, that for each (k + 1)-simplex σk+1 of Nk+1, rk|∂σk extends over σk+1 to a map
into X, thereby giving a retraction rk+1 : N (k+1)
k+1 ∪ X → X. The desired retraction
(cid:3)
follows by induction.
Example 1. Using the above observations, one sees that: every ﬁnite-dimensional
or Hilbert cube manifold; every locally ﬁnite CW, simplicial, or cube complex; and
every ﬁnite-dimensional proper CAT(0) space is an ANR. (In fact, [Ont05] shows that
every proper CAT(0) space is an ANR, hence an AR.)

k

A few deeper facts about ANRs will play a role in this paper. We state them here

without proofs.
Theorem 2.9 (Hanner’s Theorem [Han51]). A space X is an ANR if for every open
cover U of X there is an ANR Y and maps f : X → Y and g : Y → X such that gf
is U-homotopic to idX.
Theorem 2.10 (West’s Theorem [Wes77]). Every ANR is proper homotopy equiv-
alent to a locally ﬁnite polyhedron; every compact ANR is homotopy equivalent to a
ﬁnite polyhedron.
Theorem 2.11 (Edwards’ Theorem [Edw80]). If X is a locally compact ANR, then
X × [0, 1]∞ is a Hilbert cube manifold.

3. Z-sets and Z-compactifications

A closed subset A of a space X, is a Z-set if there exists a homotopy H : X×[0, 1] →
X such that H0 = idX and Ht(X) ⊂ X − A for every t > 0. In this case we say that
H instantly homotopes X oﬀ from A.

Remark 3. Notice that, if A ⊆ X is a Z-set, then A is nowhere dense in X.

Example 2. The prototypical Z-set is the boundary of a manifold. More generally,
a closed subset A of an n-manifold M n is a Z-set if and only if A ⊆ ∂M n.

The following lemma generalizes [Fer00, Prop.1.6]. It will play a crucial role in our

boundary swapping theorems.

Lemma 3.1. Let f : (X, A) → (Y, B) and g : (Y, B) → (X, A) be continuous maps
with f (X − A) ⊆ Y − B, g (Y − B) ⊆ X − A, and gf |A = idA. Suppose further that
there is a homotopy J : X × [0, 1] → X which is ﬁxed on A and satisﬁes: J0 = idX,
J1 = gf , and J ((X − A) × [0, 1]) ⊆ X − A. If B is a Z-set in Y , then A is a Z-set
in X.

Proof. Since A = g−1 (B), A is closed in X. Choose K : Y × [0, 1] → Y that instantly
homotopes Y oﬀ from B. We will construct H : X × [0, 1] → X, which instantly
homotopes X oﬀ from A, by describing the track of each x ∈ X.

For each x ∈ X deﬁne αx : [0, 1] → X by αx (t) = Jt (x) and βx : [0, 1] → X by

βx (t) = gKt (f (x)). Note that

(1) αx (0) = x and αx (1) = gf (x) = βx (0),
(2) if x ∈ X − A then αx, βx ⊆ X − A,
(3) if x ∈ A then αx ≡ x, βx (0) = x, and βx ((0, 1]) ⊆ X − A, and
(4) diam (αx) → 0 as d (x, A) → 0.
The track γx of x under H will follow the concatenation αx · βx, but in order for
points to be instantly homotoped oﬀ from A, reparameterizations are necessary. Let
rx = min
and deﬁne γx : [0, 1] → X as follows:

d (x, A) , 1
2

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

γx (t) =

αx (t/rx)
βx (t − rx/1 − rx)

if 0 ≤ t < rx
if rx ≤ t ≤ 1

(cid:26)

Observation 4 and the fact that αx, βx, and rx vary continuously with x combine to
show that γx varies continuously with x. Deﬁne H (x, t) = γx (t) and apply Observa-
(cid:3)
tions 2 and 3 to deduce that H instantly homotopes X oﬀ from A.

A Z-compactiﬁcation of a space Y is a compactiﬁcation Y such that Z ≡ Y − Y
is a Z-set in Y . In that case we call Z a Z-boundary for Y . Here we follow standard
convention for compactiﬁcations ([Mun00] or [Dug78]) by requiring Y to be Hausdorﬀ
and Y to be dense in Y . Under that convention: Y must be locally compact and
Hausdorﬀ; Y is necessarily open in Y ; and Z is compact and nowhere dense.

Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 allow us to stay within preferred categories of spaces when

taking Z-compactiﬁcations.

8

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

Lemma 3.2. If Y is a Z-compactiﬁcation of a (separable metrizable) space Y , then
Y is also separable and metrizable.

Proof. For metrizability, we apply the Urysohn Metrization Theorem [Mun00, p.214].
Since Y is compact and Hausdorﬀ it is a normal space, so we need only check that
there is a countable basis for its topology. Being separable and metrizable, Y admits
a countable basis B0. For each integer i > 0, let Bi =
and note

1/i (B) | B ∈ B0

H −1

n

o

that B = ∪i≥0Bi is a countable basis for Y .

Since Y is compact and metrizable, it is separable.

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.3. If Y is a Z-compactiﬁcation of an ANR Y , then Y is an ANR. If Y
is an AR, then so is Y .

Proof. The fact that Y is an ANR is a straight forward consequence of Theorem 2.9.
For the latter observation, use the deﬁnition of Z-set to homotope Y into Y , then
follow that homotopy with a contraction of Y to obtain a contraction of Y . Now
(cid:3)
apply Corollary 2.4.

Lemma 3.4. Let N be a neighborhood of a Z-set A in an ANR X. Then A is a
Z-set in N.

Proof. Let H : X × [0, 1] → X instantly homotope X oﬀ from A, and choose open
sets U, U ′ ⊆ X such that

A ⊆ U ⊆ U ⊆ U ′ ⊆ U ′ ⊆ int N.

By truncating H at a time 0 < t0 ≤ 1 then reparameterizing, we may obtain a
⊆ U ′. Extend K to the
homotopy K : U × [0, 1] → int N such that K
trivial (constantly identity) homotopy on (N − U ′) × [0, 1] and the identity map on
N × {0}. By Corollary 2.5, we can apply the Homotopy Extension Property to obtain
K : int N × [0, 1] → int N, after which we can extend to the identity over the frontier
of N. Moreover, by choosing a suﬃciently small neighborhood V of (int N − U ′) ∪ U
(as was used in the proof of the Homotopy Extension Property) we can arrange that
(cid:3)
no track of K passes through A.

U × [0, 1]
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

Remark 4. If one restricts attention to ANRs, Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 allow a variety
of equivalent formulations of Z-set and Z-compactiﬁcation. For example, a closed
subset A of an ANR X is a Z-set if and only if U − A ֒→ U is a homotopy equivalence
for every open set U in Y . See [Hen75].

The next deﬁnition blends topology and geometry in that the speciﬁc metric on X

plays a role.

Deﬁnition 3.5. A controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of a proper metric space (Y, d) is a
Z-compactiﬁcation Y satisfying the additional condition:

(‡) For every R > 0 and every open cover U of Y , there is a compact set C ⊂ Y so
that if A ⊆ Y − C and diamd A < R, then A ⊆ U for some U ∈ U.

PROPER HOMOTOPY TYPES AND Z-BOUNDARIES

Example 3. The (standard) compactiﬁcation of hyperbolic n-space, by addition of
an end point to each ray emanating from the origin, is a controlled Z-compacti-
ﬁcation; so is the analogous compactiﬁcation of Euclidean n-space. More generally,
adding the visual sphere at inﬁnity, with the cone topology, to a proper CAT(0) space
is a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation.

The compactiﬁcation R = R ∪ {±∞} is a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of R. By
contrast, R×R is a Z-compactiﬁcation of R2, but not a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation
(under the Euclidean metric).

Remark 5. By Lemma 3.2, we may place a metric d on Y . Then, using Lebesgue
numbers, (‡) can be reformulated as:
(‡′) For every R > 0 and ε > 0, there is a compact C ⊂ Y so that if A ⊆ Y − C and
diamd A < R, then diamd A < ε.

Except for an impact on the size of C, the speciﬁc d chosen is unimportant; more-
over, there is no direct relationship between d and d. The following useful lemma
highlights the diﬀerence between those metrics.

Lemma 3.6. Suppose Y = Y ∪ Z is a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of Y . For each
z ∈ Z, each neighborhood U of z in Y , and each R > 0, there is a neighborhood V of
z so that dY (V, Y − U) ≥ R.

Proof. Place a metric d on Y , then choose a neighborhood U ′ of z whose closure is
contained in the interior of U and let ǫ = d(U ′, Y − U). From the control condition
there is a C ⊆ Y so that sets in Y − C of d-diameter less than R have d-diameter
less than ǫ/2. Set V = U ′ − NR (C), where NR (C) is the closed R-neighborhood of
C, and suppose there exist x ∈ V and y ∈ Y − U with d(x, y) < R. Then y ∈ Y − C,
so {x, y} ⊆ Y − C and diamd{x, y} < R. By the control condition d(x, y) < ǫ/2, a
(cid:3)
contradiction.

4. Preliminaries from geometric group theory and metric geometry

Through the remainder of this paper, functions (also called maps) are not always
continuous. When continuity is assumed or required, it will be done explicitly. Since
the concepts presented here are geometric, all spaces are assumed to come with a
ﬁxed metric. We use Bd (x, r) and Bd [x, r] to denote open and closed metric balls,
respectively.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let X be a space, A a collection of subsets of X, and D ⊆ X.

(1) A is locally discrete if each x ∈ X has a neighborhood intersecting at most

one element of A

(2) A is uniformly bounded if the set {diam (A) | A ∈ A} is bounded above, and
(3) D is large-scale dense (also called quasi-dense) if {d (x, D) | x ∈ X} is bounded

above.

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let f, g : X → Y be functions. Then

(1) f is large-scale surjective if f (X) is large-scale dense in Y ,

10

(2) f is metrically proper if the pre-image of every bounded subset of Y is a

bounded in X,

(3) f is large-scale uniform (also called bornologous) if, for every R > 0, there is

an S > 0 so that if dX(x, x′) < R, then dY (f (x), f (x′)) < S,

(4) f and g are boundedly close if {diam (f (x) , g (x)) | x ∈ X} is bounded above.

We reserve the term proper for its traditional meaning: a continuous function
f : X → Y for which f −1(C) is compact whenever C is compact. Similarly, homotopy
always indicates a continuous function. A bounded homotopy H : X × [0, 1] → Y
is one for which the collection {H ({x} × [0, 1]) | x ∈ X} is uniformly bounded. A
continuous function f : X → Y is a proper homotopy equivalence if there exists a
continuous g : Y → X such that gf and f g are homotopic, via proper homotopies,
to idX and idY , respectively. The following is immediate.

Lemma 4.3. Let f, g : X → Y be functions between proper metric spaces. Then
(1) if f and g are boundedly close and f is metrically proper, then so is g,
(2) if f and g are large-scale uniform and boundedly close over a large-scale dense

subset of X, then f and g are boundedly close,

(3) f is metrically proper and continuous if and only if f is proper, and
(4) if H : X × [0, 1] → Y is a bounded homotopy, then H is proper if and only if

Ht is proper for some [resp., all] t.

The next set of deﬁnitions provides useful generalizations of “quasi-isometric em-

bedding” and “quasi-isometry”.

Deﬁnition 4.4. A map f : X → Y is:

(1) coarse if it is metrically proper and large-scale uniform;
(2) a coarse equivalence if it has a coarse inverse, i.e., a coarse map g : Y → X

such that gf and f g are boundedly close to idX and idY ;
(3) a coarse embedding if f : X → f (X) is a coarse equivalence.

Remark 6. An equivalent formulation of coarse embedding is the existence of non-
decreasing, metrically proper functions ρ−, ρ+ : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) such that

ρ− (d (x, x′)) ≤ d (f (x) , f (x′)) ≤ ρ+ (d (x, x′))
for all x, x′ ∈ X, with f being a coarse equivalence if it is also large-scale surjective.
Quasi-isometric embeddings and quasi-isometries are the special cases where ρ− and
ρ+ can be chosen to be aﬃne linear functions.

A group action on a metric space X is geometric if it is proper, cocompact, and
by isometries. Here cocompact means that there exists a compact K ⊆ X such that
GK = X, and proper (sometimes called properly discontinuous) means that, for any
compact K ⊆ X, the set {g ∈ G | gK ∩ K 6= ∅} is ﬁnite. A useful application of the
notion of coarse equivalence is the following variation on the classical ˇSvarc-Milnor
Lemma.

PROPER HOMOTOPY TYPES AND Z-BOUNDARIES

11

Proposition 4.5 (Generalized ˇSvarc-Milnor). Suppose G acts geometrically on a
connected proper metric space X. Then G is ﬁnitely generated and, when G is en-
dowed with a corresponding word metric and x0 ∈ X, the map g 7→ gx0 is a coarse
equivalence.

Proof. This is a special case of [BDM07, Cor.0.9]. Our version is simpler since the
ﬁnite generation of G (which is standard [BH99, Th.I.8.10]), allows the use of a word
(cid:3)
metric, which (also standard) is well-deﬁned up to quasi-isometry.

Remark 7. For length spaces (hence, for ﬁnitely generated groups) coarsely equiva-
lent and quasi-isometric are equivalent notions [NY12, p.19]. A nice aspect of Propo-
sition 4.5 is that X need not be a length space.

The order of an open cover U of a space X is the largest integer k such that some x ∈
X is contained in k members of U. Classical Lebesgue covering dimension of X looks
at orders of open covers with arbitrarily small mesh; at the other extreme, asymptotic
dimension of X considers orders of uniformly bounded covers with arbitrarily large
Lebesgue numbers. The following deﬁnition is far less rigid than either of these,
requiring a single uniformly bounded open cover of a given index.

Deﬁnition 4.6. A space X has ﬁnite macroscopic dimension if it admits a uniformly
If the order of that cover is n + 1, we write
bounded open cover of ﬁnite order.
mdim X ≤ n; if n is the minimum such integer, we say mdim X = n.

Deﬁnition 4.7. A space X is uniformly contractible if for each R > 0, there exists
S > R so that every ball B(x, R) contracts in B(x, S).

The most fundamental examples of the above two deﬁnitions occur in the context

of geometric group actions.

Lemma 4.8. If a group G acts geometrically on a contractible proper metric space
X, then X is uniformly contractible and has ﬁnite macroscopic dimension.

Proof. Let x0 ∈ X, and choose T > 0 suﬃciently large that GB (x0, T ) = X. Ap-
plying properness to B[x0, T ] shows that {gB (x0, T ) | g ∈ G} is a ﬁnite order open
cover.

For uniform contractibility, let R > 0 and x ∈ X be arbitrary. Since B[x0, T + R] is
compact, the contraction of X restricts to a contraction of B[x0, T +R] in B (x0, S) for
some S > 0. Choose g ∈ G such that d (x, gx0) < T . Then B (x, R) ⊆ B (gx0, R + T ).
Since the latter contracts in B (gx0, S), which is contained in B (x, T + S), then
(cid:3)
B (x, R) contracts in B (x, T + S) .

5. Continuous approximations and proper homotopy equivalences

A crucial ingredient in this paper is an ability to approximate certain functions
with continuous ones. In this section, we develop the necessary tools. Theorem 1.1
and Corollary 1.2 will be almost immediate consequences.

Let U be a locally ﬁnite open cover of a space X. The nerve of U is the abstract
simplicial complex N (U) with vertex set U and a k-simplex {U0, U1, · · · , Uk} whenever

12

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

i=0Ui 6= ∅. Clearly N (U) is a locally ﬁnite complex. When discussing the geometric
∩k
realization |N (U)| we will denote the vertex corresponding to U ∈ U by vU . There is
a partition of unity {λU }U ∈U where, for each U0 ∈ U, λU0 : X → [0, 1] is deﬁned by

λU0 (x) = d (x, X\U0) /

d (x, X\U)

PU ∈U

The local ﬁniteness assumption ensures that the sums are ﬁnite and continuous. Use
these functions to deﬁne the barycentric map β : X → |N (U)| by

f (x) =

λU (x) vU

PU ∈U
In other words, x is taken to the point in the geometric realization of the simplex
{U0, U1, · · · , Uk} of all open sets containing x with barycentric coordinates λUi (x).

Our primary use of the above construction is the following.

Lemma 5.1. Suppose X admits a uniformly bounded open cover of order n + 1.
Then X contains a collection A0, A1, · · · , An of locally discrete families of disjoint,
uniformly bounded, closed sets which together cover X.

Proof. By a theorem of general topology (see Lemma 41.6 in [Mun00]) we may assume
that U is locally ﬁnite. Let β : X → |N (U)| be the barycentric map. Let N ′ and N ′′
be the ﬁrst and second derived subdivision of |N (U)|; then for each i, let Ai be the
collection of preimages of closed star neighborhoods in N ′′ of the vertices of N ′ which
(cid:3)
are barycenters of the i-simplices of |N (U)|.

Proposition 5.2. Let f : X → Y be a large-scale uniform function, where X has
ﬁnite macroscopic dimension and Y is a uniformly contractible ANR. Then there is
a continuous function g : X → Y that is a bounded distance from f . If E ⊆ X is a
closed set on which f is already continuous, then g may be chosen so that g|E = f |E
Proof. Let A0, A1, · · · , An be a ﬁnite set of locally discrete collections of K-bounded
closed sets which together cover X, and let A denote the collection ∪Ai. From each
A ∈ A, choose a point pA, and note that the set {pA} is discrete. By adjoining these
points to E we may assume, without loss of generality, that E intersects each A ∈ A.
Deﬁne closed sets C−1 ⊆ C0 ⊆ C1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Cn by C−1 = E and Ci = Ci−1 ∪

(∪A∈AiA) for each i ≥ 0. We will construct g : X → Y inductively over the Ci.

Choose L > 0 such that d (f (x) , f (x′)) < L whenever d (x, x′) < K. Then let
g−1 ≡ f |E : C−1 → Y , and assume inductively that there exists Li > 0 and a
continuous function gi : Ci → Y which is 2Li-close to f |Ci and agrees with f on E.
To extend gi to gi+1 : Ci+1 → Y , let A ∈ Ai+1. Since f (A) ⊆ B (f (pA), L), then
gi (C i ∩ A) ⊆ B (f (pA), L + 2Li). Choose Li+1 > L+2Li so that each B (y, L + 2Li) ⊆
Y contracts in B (y, Li+1). By Corollaries 2.3 and 2.5, there is a continuous exten-
sion of gi|A∩Ci to gA
i+1 : A → B (y, Li+1); this map is necessarily 2Li+1-close to f |A.
i+1, over all A ∈ Ai+1, to obtain a continuous map
Take the union of gi with the gA
gi+1 : Ci+1 → Y which is 2Li+1-close to f |Ci+1 and is identical to f on E. The
(cid:3)
Proposition follows by induction.

PROPER HOMOTOPY TYPES AND Z-BOUNDARIES

13

Corollary 5.3. Suppose f, g : X → Y are continuous, boundedly close, large-scale
uniform maps, where X has ﬁnite macroscopic dimension and Y is a uniformly con-
tractible ANR. Then f and g are boundedly homotopic.

Proof. Apply Proposition 5.2 to the situation J0 = f and Jt = g for 0 < t ≤ 1 and
(cid:3)
E = X × {0, 1} to get a continuous approximation K : X × [0, 1] → Y .

Corollary 5.4. Let f ′ : X → Y be a coarse equivalence between uniformly contractible
proper metric ANRs, each having ﬁnite macroscopic dimension. Then

(1) f ′ is boundedly close to a continuous coarse equivalence f : X → Y ,
(2) f (and hence f ′) has a continuous coarse inverse g : Y → X,
(3) gf and f g are boundedly (hence properly) homotopic to idX and idY , so f and

g are proper homotopy equivalences.

The ﬁnal observation of this section provides strong versions Theorem 1.1 and

Corollary 1.2.

Theorem 5.5. Suppose quasi-isometric groups G and H act geometrically on proper
metric ANRs X and Y , respectively. Then X and Y are proper homotopy equivalent
via continuous coarse equivalences.

Proof. Use Proposition 4.5 to conclude that X and Y are coarsely equivalent to their
respective groups and, thus, to each other; then apply Lemma 4.8 and the previous
(cid:3)
corollary.

6. Z-Boundaries of groups

In [Bes96], Bestvina introduced the notion of “Z-boundary of a group”, to provide
a framework that includes Gromov boundaries of word hyperbolic groups and visual
boundaries of CAT(0) groups, and can also be applied to other types of groups, as well.
To avoid some technical issues, he restricted attention to groups that act properly,
freely, and cocompactly (i.e., by covering transformations) on ﬁnite-dimensional ARs
(i.e., ERs).
In [Dra06], Dranishnikov modiﬁed the deﬁnition to allow for non-free
actions and arbitrary (proper metric) ARs; but the added ﬂexibility came with a
loss of generality in some key theorems. Some of the lost generality was restored in
[Mor16]; most of the rest is taken care of in this paper. So, with recent progress taken
into account, Dranishnikov’s version seems to be the “right” deﬁnition. It is:

Deﬁnition 6.1. A Z-structure on a group G is a pair of spaces (X, Z) satisfying the
following four conditions:

(1) X is a compact AR,
(2) Z is a Z-set in X,
(3) X = X − Z is a proper metric space on which G acts geometrically, and
(4) X satisﬁes the following nullity condition with respect to the G-action on X:
for every compact C ⊆ X and any open cover U of X, all but ﬁnitely many
G translates of C lie in an element of U.

14

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

When this deﬁnition is satisﬁed, Z is called a Z-boundary for G. If, in addition to
the above, the G-action on X extends to X, the result is called an EZ-structure
(equivariant Z-structure), and Z is called an EZ-boundary for G.

Examples:

(1) If G acts geometrically on a proper CAT(0) space X, then X = X ∪ ∂∞X,

with the cone topology, gives an EZ-structure for G.

(2) In [BM91] it is shown that if G is a hyperbolic group, Pρ(G) is an appropriately
chosen Rips complex, and ∂G is the Gromov boundary, then P ρ(G) = Pρ(G)∪
∂G (appropriately topologized) gives an EZ-structure for G.

(3) Osajda and Przytycki [OP09] have shown that systolic groups admit EZ-

structures.

(4) Guilbault, Moran, and Tirel [GMT] have shown that Baumslag-Solitar groups

admit EZ-structures.

More general classes of groups have been addressed by Tirel [Tir11] (free and di-
rect products), Dahmani [Dah03] (relatively hyperbolic groups), and Martin [Mar14]
(complexes of groups).

Remark 8. Bestvina’s deﬁnition of Z-structure did not require G to act by isometries
on X, but only cocompactly by covering transformations. By the following proposi-
tion, deduced from [AMN11], there is no loss of generality in requiring a geometric
action.

Proposition 6.2. Suppose G acts properly and cocompactly on a locally compact
space X. Then there is an equivalent proper metric for X under which which the
action is by isometries.

Due to our use of coarse equivalences and the Generalized ˇSvarc-Milnor Theorem,
the following proposition (when it applies) is stronger than necessary. We include it
because it is interesting and not widely known.

Proposition 6.3. Suppose G acts cocompactly by covering transformations on a con-
nected, locally connected space X. Then there is an equivalent proper geodesic metric
for X under which the action is by isometries.

Proof. Let p : X → G\X be the resulting covering projection. By [Bin52], there is a
geodesic metric d′ on G\X which generates the desired quotient topology. Lift that
metric to X by deﬁning

ρ (x, y) = inf {length (pα) | α is a path in X from x to y}

Since p is a local homeomorphism, ρ generates the original topology on X. By similar
reasoning, (X, ρ) is complete and locally compact; so by the Hopf-Rinow Theorem
[BH99, Ch.I.3], ρ is a proper geodesic metric. Clearly the G-action on (X, ρ) is by
(cid:3)
isometries.

PROPER HOMOTOPY TYPES AND Z-BOUNDARIES

15

Without the beneﬁt of covering space theory, we do not know the answer to the

following:

Question. If a group G acts geometrically on a proper metric AR (X, d) does there
exist an equivalent geodesic metric ρ under which the action is by isometries?

We close this section with an easy, but useful, lemma linking controlled Z-com-

pactiﬁcations and Z-structures.

Lemma 6.4. If a group G admits a Z-structure (X, Z), then X is a controlled Z-
compactiﬁcation of X = X − Z. Conversely, if G acts geometrically on a proper
metric AR (X, d) which admits a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation X = X ∪ Z, then
(X, Z) is a Z-structure on G.

Proof. The initial observation can be found in [GM16]. For the converse, choose any
compact set C ⊂ X and any open cover U of X. Set R = diam C + 1. From the
control condition on X, there is a compact K ⊆ X so that each subset of X − K of
diameter less than R is contained in element of U. Since the action is by isometries
diam(gC) < R for all g ∈ G, and since the action is proper only ﬁnitely many
(cid:3)
translates of C intersect K; thus, all but ﬁnitely many lie in an element of U.

7. Boundary swapping

We now obtain proofs of Theorems 1.3 and 1.4. Both follow from a more gen-
eral theorem that does not involve group actions. Our approach expands upon one
suggested by Ferry [Fer00].

Theorem 7.1. Let f : (X, dX) → (Y, dY ) be a coarse equivalence between uniformly
contractible proper metric spaces, each having ﬁnite macroscopic dimension, and sup-
pose Y admits a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation Y = Y ∪Z. Then X admits a controlled
Z-compactiﬁcation X = X ∪Z. If f is continuous, this may be done so that f extends
to a continuous map f : X → Y which is the identity on Z.

Proof. If necessary, use Corollary 5.4 to replace f with a continuous coarse equivalence
and choose a continuous coarse inverse g : Y → X and a bounded homotopy J :
X × [0, 1] → X with J0 = idX and J1 = gf .

Extend f to a function f : X ⊔ Z → Y by letting f be the identity on Z. Then give
(U)
X ⊔ Z the topology generated by the open subsets of X and sets of the form f
where U ⊂ Y is open, and let X denote the resulting topological space. Clearly,
f : X → Y is continuous and X is compact, Hausdorﬀ, and second countable. It
follows that X is metrizable and separable. The theorem will be proved by showing
that X is a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of X.

−1

Before proceeding, we establish some notation. Let g : Y → X and J : X ×[0, 1] →
X be the obvious extensions which are the identity on Z, and ﬁx metrics dX and dY to
X and Y , respectively (these are not extensions of dX and dY ). Whenever U denotes
a subset of X [resp., Y ], U will denote U ∩ X [resp., U ∩ Y ]. Finally, select K > 0 so
that J is a K-homotopy and f g is K-close to idY .

16

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

Claim 1. X is a Z-compactiﬁcation of X.

This claim follows from Lemma 3.1, provided that g and J are continuous (all other

hypotheses are immediate).

−1

To see that g is continuous at z ∈ Z, let f

be a basic open neighborhood of
g (z) = z in X. Then z ∈ U and by Lemma 3.6, there is a smaller open neighborhood
V of z in Y such that dY (V, Y − U) > K. If y ∈ V then dY (y, f (g (y))) ≤ K, so
f (g (y)) ∈ U ⊆ U ; therefore g (y) ∈ f
, so g is
U
continuous at z.

Subclaim. Given z ∈ Z, a neighborhood U of z in X, and R > 0, there is a
neighborhood V of z so that d(V, X − U) ≥ R.

−1

Proof of subclaim. Since f is a coarse map, choose S > 0 so that whenever
dX(x, x′) < R then dY (f (x), f (x′)) < S. Without loss of generality, we may assume
(W ), where W is open in Y . By Lemma 3.6, z has an open neigh-
that U = f
borhood W ′ ⊂ W dY (W ′, Y − W ) > S. Let V = f
(W ′) and note that if x ∈ V ,
y ∈ X − U, and d(x, y) < R; then f (x) ∈ W ′, f (y) ∈ Y − W , and dY (f (x), f (y)) ≤ S,
a contradiction which proves the subclaim.

−1

To see that J is continuous at (z, t) ∈ Z × [0, 1], let U be a neighborhood of
J (z, t) = z in X. Apply the subclaim to ﬁnd a neighborhood V of z in X such that
dX (V, X − U) > K. For any x ∈ V , J (x × [0, 1]) intersects V and has diameter
⊆ U, so J is continuous at
≤ K, so J (V × [0, 1]) ⊆ U. It follows that J
(x, t) and Claim 1 is complete.

Since W covers Z, C ≡ Y − ∪W is a compact subset of Y . Let D be a compact
subset of Y such that C ⊆ int D. Then W ∗ = W∪ {int D} is an open cover of Y .
Choose S > 0 so that, if A ⊆ X and diamdX (A) ≤ R, then diamdY (f (A)) ≤ S. Then
choose compact E ⊆ Y such that E ⊇ D and subsets of Y − E of dY -diameter < S
lie in an element of W ∗. Then f −1 (E) ⊆ X is compact and if A ⊆ X − f −1 (E) with
diamdX (A) < R, then f (A) lies in an element of W ∗ which is clearly not int D. So
(cid:3)
f (A) ⊆ W for some W ∈ W, and therefore A ⊆ f

(W ) ∈ U.

Proof. By Lemma 4.8 both X and Y are uniformly contractible with ﬁnite macro-
scopic dimension, and by Proposition 4.5 they are coarsely equivalent. Since Y is a
controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of Y (Lemma 6.4), Theorem 7.1 provides a correspond-
ing controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of X. Another application of Lemma 6.4 assures
(cid:3)
the desired Z-structure on G.

The non-equivariant version of standard boundary swapping is now immediate.

Corollary 7.3 (Z-boundary Swapping Theorem). If G acts geometrically on proper
for G,
metric ARs X and Y , and Y can be compactiﬁed to a Z-structure
then X can be compactiﬁed by addition of the same boundary to another Z-structure

for G.

The EZ-version of Corollary 7.3 requires some additional work. We already have
a Z-compactiﬁcation X = X ⊔ Z; moreover, G acts on X and Z, individually (the
latter by restricting the action on Y ). The idea is to combine these into a single
G-action on X. For each γ ∈ G, if γX : X → X and γZ : Z → Z are the corre-
sponding homeomorphisms under the sub-actions, we need γX ∪ γZ : X → X to be a
homeomorphism. For that, it is enough to verify continuity at points of Z.

A variation on the continuity argument for g, used in Theorem 7.1, proves:

Lemma 7.4. Let X = X ⊔ Z be a controlled Z-compactiﬁcation of a proper metric
space X and suppose f, f ′ : X → X are boundedly close continuous functions. If
f : X → X is a continuous extension of f that takes Z into Z, then f ′ = f ′ ∪ f
Z is
a continuous extension of f ′.
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

In Theorem 7.1, we began with a continuous coarse equivalence f : X → Y and a
continuous a coarse inverse g : Y → X. Those were extended to continuous functions
f : X → Y and g : Y → X, both of which are the identity on Z. If, in addition, the
G-action on Y extends to Y , then for every γ ∈ G, gγf : X → X is a continuous
extension of gγf which agrees with γ on Z. By Lemma 7.4, if gγf is boundedly close
to γ on X, we can extend γ to X using γ|Z. So EZ-boundary swapping is completed
by the following proposition.

Proposition 7.5. Suppose proper metric ARs X and Y each admit geometric G-
actions. Then there exists a continuous coarse equivalence f : X → Y , a continuous
coarse inverse h : Y → X, and a constant K > 0 such that, for every γ ∈ G, hγf is
K-close to γ.

Proof. Fix points x0 ∈ X and y0 ∈ Y . Let α : G → X be deﬁned as α(g) = gx0
and β : G → Y be given by β(g) = gy0. Since G acts geometrically on X and Y ,
Proposition 4.5 guarantees, when G is endowed with a word metric, that α and β
are coarse equivalences. Deﬁne a coarse inverse α′ : X → G as follows:
for each
gx0 ∈ Gx0, let α′(gx0) = g′ where g′ ∈ G is such that gx0 = g′x0. Having deﬁned α′
on the orbit of x0, we may now deﬁne α′ on all of X. Since G acts cocompactly on
X, there exists an R > 0 such that X = GB(x0, R). Then, for x ∈ X, choose a g ∈ G
such that x ∈ gB(x0, R) and let α′(x) = α′(gx0). Deﬁne a coarse inverse β′ : Y → G
in a similar fashion.

18

CRAIG R. GUILBAULT AND MOLLY A. MORAN

Now, let f = βα′ and h = αβ′. As these are compositions of coarse equivalences,
both f and h are coarse equivalences. We may further assume they are continuous
from Corollary 5.4. We will show these are the desired coarse equivalences.

Since G acts geometrically on X and Y , stabilizers of points have uniformly bounded
diameters (e.g., [BH99, I.8.5]). Choose M > 0 such that diamGGz < M for all
z ∈ X ∪ Y . Then choose L > 0 so that whenever dG(g1, g2) < M, dX(α(g1), α(g2)) =
dX(g1x0, g2x0) < L, and set K = R + 2L. We will show that hγf is K-close to γ for
all γ ∈ G.

Let x ∈ X and γ ∈ G. Choose g ∈ G so that x ∈ gB(x0, R) and note that
dX(γx, γgx0) < R. Now, consider, hγf (x) = αβ′γβα′(x). By deﬁnition, α′(x) =
α′(gx0) = g1 for some g1 ∈ G with g1x0 = gx0. Notice that since g−1g1 ∈ Gx0,
then dG(g, g1) < M and thus dX(gx0, g1x0) < L. Now, β′γβα′(x) = β′γβ(g1) =
β′γ(g1y0) = β′(γg1y0) = g2 where g2 ∈ G is such that γg1y0 = g2y0. Since g−1
2 g1 ∈ Gy0,
dG(γg1, g2) < M and thus dX(γg1x0, g2x0) < L.

Thus, we have hγf (x) = α(g2) = g2x0 and we observe:

dX(γx, hγf (x)) = dX(γx, g2x0)

≤ dX(γx, γgx0) + dX(γgx0, γg1x0) + dX(γg1x0, g2x0) < R + L + L = K.

8. Shape equivalence of Z-boundaries

We now prove Theorem 1.5 and Corollary 1.6. For readers familiar with shape the-
ory, these are almost immediate consequences of the Boundary Swapping Theorems.
That connection and the remaining technical details were worked out in [Gui16, §3.7];
but there the conclusions were less general since a full-blown boundary swapping the-
orem was not yet known. Here we complete the picture. We will begin with a brief
review of shape theory and then outline the main argument. Additional details can
be found in [Gui16, §3.7]. For comprehensive treatments of shape theory, see [Bor71],
[DS78] or [MsS82].

To deﬁne the shape of a compact metric space A, one ﬁrst associates to A an inverse

sequence of ﬁnite polyhedra and continuous maps

K0

f1←− K1

f2←− K2

f3←− · · ·

Such a sequence can be obtained in a variety of ways. For example: the Ki can be
chosen to be nerves of progressively ﬁner ﬁnite open covers of A; or, if A can be
embedded in Rn, the Ki can be progressively smaller polyhedral neighborhoods of A
connected by inclusion maps. Clearly, these sequences are not uniquely determined

by A. A pair of inverse sequences of ﬁnite polyhedra {Ki, fi} and {Li, gi} are pro-
homotopy equivalent if they contain subsequences that ﬁt into a ladder diagram

in which each triangle of maps homotopy commutes. (Doubly subscripted maps are
compositions.) It can be shown that any two inverse sequences associated with A are
pro-homotopy equivalent. The pro-homotopy class of these sequences determines the
shape of A, i.e., compact metric spaces A and A′ are deﬁned to be shape equivalent
if their associated inverse sequences are pro-homotopy equivalent.

If A is a compact subset of an ANR X, one can always choose a nested sequence

of compact neighborhoods

(8.1)

L0 ←֓ L1 ←֓ L2 ←֓ · · ·

with ∩Li = A. If, in addition, the Li themselves can be chosen to be ANRs (as is
the case for the most commonly studied X), Theorem 2.10 allows us to use sequence
(1.3) to represent the shape of A. From there, a proof of Theorem 1.1 is rather easy.
For the general case, we will use just a bit of the theory of Hilbert cube manifolds (in
particular Theorem 2.11) along with the boundary swapping techniques developed
here, to replace X with a space for which that easy strategy can be applied.

Remark 9. For those who prefer to avoid Hilbert cube manifolds, a more general (but
slightly more technical) approach to shape theory can be used to circumvent their
need. That approach, developed in [MsS82], allows the use of inﬁnite CW complexes
(or noncompact ANRs) in associated inverse sequences representing a compactum A.
That means an allowable sequence of type (8.1) is immediately available—just choose
the Li to be open neighborhoods of A. (This approach was used by Ontaneda for
similar purposes in [Ont05].) Whichever approach one uses, boundary swapping helps
to make the ﬁnal conclusion straightforward, as the following argument shows.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. Suppose quasi-isometric groups G and H admit Z-structures
with boundaries Z and Z ′, respectively. Then, by Theorem 7.1, there exists a proper
metric AR X and a pair of Z-compactiﬁcations X = X ∪ Z and X
= X ∪ Z. Assume
for the moment that there is a sequence

′

N 0 ←֓ N 1 ←֓ N 2 ←֓ · · ·

of compact ANR neighborhoods of Z in X with ∩N i = Z. By Corollary 2.5 and
Lemma 3.3, this is equivalent to the existence of a coﬁnal sequence

N0 ←֓ N1 ←֓ N2 ←֓ · · ·

of closed ANR neighborhoods of inﬁnity in X, where by Lemma 3.4, each N i is a
Z-compactiﬁcation of Ni. Since each Ni ֒→ N i is a homotopy equivalence, choose
homotopy inverses gi : N i → Ni.

To complete the proof, we must address the situation where Z does not have
arbitrarily small compact ANR neighborhoods in X (equivalently, X does not contain
arbitrarily small closed ANR neighborhoods of inﬁnity). In that case, we will replace
X with the AR X × [0, 1]∞. By Theorem 1.4 or Corollary 7.3, we can Z-compactify
X × [0, 1]∞ with either Z or Z ′, and by Theorem 2.11, X × [0, 1]∞ is a Hilbert cube
manifold. By standard Hilbert cube manifold topology [Cha76], X × [0, 1]∞ contains
arbitrarily small closed Hilbert cube manifold neighborhoods of inﬁnity. Since these
(cid:3)
are ANRs, the general case follows from the earlier special case.
