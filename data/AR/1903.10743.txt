We present a numerical implementation of the time-dependent surface ﬂux (tSURFF) method
[New J. Phys. 14, 013021 (2012)], an eﬃcient computational scheme to extract photoelectron
energy spectra, to the time-dependent multiconﬁguration self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-MCSCF) method.
Extending the original tSURFF method developed for single particle systems, we formulate the
equations of motion for the spectral amplitude of orbital functions constutiting the TD-MCSCF
wave function, from which the angle-resolved photoelectron energy spectrum, and more generally,
photoelectron reduced density matrices (RDMs) are readiliy obtained. The tSURFF method applied
to the TD-MCSCF wave function, in combination with an eﬃcient absorbing boundary oﬀered by
the inﬁnite-range exterior complex scaling, enables accurate ab initio computations of photoelectron
energy spectra from multielectron systems subject to an intense and ultrashort laser pulse with a
computational cost signiﬁcantly reduced compared to that required in projecting the total wave
function onto scattering states. We apply the present implementation to the photoionization of Ne
exposed to an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulse and above-threshold ionization of Ar
irradiated by an intense mid-infrared laser ﬁeld, demonstrating both accuracy and eﬃciency of the
present method.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid progress in experimental techniques for high-
intensity, ultrashort optical pulses, has lead to the advent
and development of strong-ﬁeld physics and attosecond
science [1, 2], with the ultimate goal to directly mea-
sure and control electron motion in atoms, molecules,
and solids. Although the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (TDSE) provides a rigorous theoretical frame-
work to investigate electron dynamics, solving it for mul-
tielectron systems poses a major challenge. To simulate
multielectron dynamics in intense laser ﬁelds, the time-
dependent multiconﬁguration self-consistent ﬁeld (TD-
MCSCF) methods have been developed [3–12] which ex-
press the total wave function as a superposition,

Ψ(t) =

(cid:88)

I

ΦI (t)CI (t),

(1)

of the Slater determinants (or electronic conﬁgurations)
ΦI (t) constructed from single-electron orbitals. Both the
conﬁguration-interaction (CI) coeﬃcients {CI } and or-
bitals are varied in time.
If we consider all the pos-
sible conﬁgurations for a given number of orbitals as
in the multiconﬁguration time-dependent Hartree-Fock
(MCTDHF) method [4–6], the computational cost in-
creases factorially with the number of electrons. To
overcome this diﬃculty, we have recently formulated and

∗ ykormhk@atto.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp

numerically implemented the time-dependent complete-
active-space self-consistent-ﬁeld (TD-CASSCF) method
[9], and even more general and less demanding time-
dependent occupation-restricted multiple-active-space
(TD-ORMAS) method [12]. The former introduces or-
bital classiﬁcation into doubly occupied core orbitals and
fully correlated active orbitals; the core orbitals are fur-
ther divided into time-independent frozen core and time-
dependent dynamical core. The latter further divides
active orbitals into an arbitrary number of subgroups,
specifying the minimum and maximum numbers of elec-
trons distributed in each subgroup. Flexible description
of the wave function oﬀered by the orbital classiﬁcation
and occupation restriction enables converged simulations
of highly nonlinear, correlated multielectron dynamics in
systems containing several tens of electrons.

Photoelectron energy spectra (PES) and their angular
distribution, or angle-resolved photoelectron energy spec-
tra (ARPES) are among important experimental probes.
In principle, they could be calculated by projecting the
departing photoelectron wave packet onto plane waves
or Coulomb waves. This approach, however, requires re-
taining the complete wave function without being ab-
sorbed, leading to a huge simulation box and prohibitive
computational cost. To circumvent this diﬃculty, Tao
and Scrinzi have devised the time-dependent surface ﬂux
(tSURFF) method [13], which extracts PES by integrat-
ing the electron ﬂux through a surface. Thus it allows one
to use an absorbing boundary, bringing signiﬁcant cost
reduction. The tSURFF method was ﬁrst developed for
single electron systems [13] and then applied to multielec-

 
 
 
 
 
 
tron simulations with, e.g., the hybrid antisymmetrized
coupled channels method [14], the time-dependent con-
ﬁguration interaction singles method [15], and the time-
dependent density functional theory[16].

In this study, we combine the tSURFF method with
the TD-CASSCF and TD-ORMAS methods in order to
extract photoelectron energy spectra from ab initio simu-
lations of multielectron dynamics in atoms subject to in-
tense and/or ultrashort laser pulses. Under a physically
reasonable assumption that the nuclear potential and in-
terelectronic Coulomb interaction are negligible for pho-
toelectron dynamics in the region distant from the nuclei,
we derive the equations of motion for the momentum am-
plitudes of each orbital. They contain an additional term
compared with the single-electron case. While we use the
inﬁnite-range exterior complex scaling (irECS) [17, 18] as
an eﬃcient absorbing boundary, the present tSURFF im-
plementation also supports other absorption boundaries
such as mask functions and complex absorbing potentials.
We achieve highly accurate calculations of angle-resolved
PES with considerably reduced computational costs.

This paper is organized as follows. We brieﬂy review
the TD-CASSCF and TD-ORMAS methods in Sec. II
and the tSURFF method for single-electron systems in
Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we describe our theoretical appli-
cation and numerical implementation of tSURFF to the
TD-MCSCF method. Numerical examples are presented
in Sec. V. Conclusions are given in Sec. VI. We use
Hartree atomic units unless otherwise indicated.

II. THE TD-CASSCF AND TD-ORMAS
METHODS

We consider an N -electron atom with N↑ up-spin and
N↓ down-spin electrons (N = N↑ + N↓) in a laser ﬁeld
E(t). Its dynamics is described within the dipole approx-
imation by the Hamiltonian,

H(t) = H1(t) + H2,

gauge, since ECS works only with it, and not with the
length gauge [19].

where ˆA denotes the antisymmetrization operator, Φfc
and Φdc the closed-shell determinants formed with nfc
frozen-core and ndc dynamical-core orbitals, respectively,
and {ΦI } the determinants constructed from na active or-
bitals. Whereas the active electrons are fully correlated
among the active orbitals in the TD-CASSCF method,
the TD-ORMAS method [12] further subdivides the ac-
tive orbitals into an arbitrary number of subgroups, spec-
ifying the minimum and maximum number of electrons
accommodated in each subgroup.

The equations of motion (EOMs) describing the tem-
poral evolution of the CI coeﬃcients {CI } and the or-
bitals {ψp} are derived on the basis of the time-dependent
variational principle (TDVP) [12, 20] and read,

III. THE tSURFF METHOD FOR
SINGLE-ELECTRON SYSTEMS

IV. APPLICATION OF THE TSURFF METHOD
TO THE TD-ORMAS SIMULATIONS

In this section, we brieﬂy review the tSURFF method

[13] for single-electron systems governed by TDSE,

(11)

(12)

To obtain PES in multielectron systems described by
the multiconﬁguration expansion Eq. (1), we deﬁne the
photoelectron reduced density matrix (PRDM). Since
our deﬁnition of ionization is based on the spatial domain
|r| > Rs , the single particle reduced density matrix of a
photoelectron in the coordinate space can be deﬁned as,

where V (r) denotes the nuclear potential. The photo-
electron momentum amplitude (PMA) a(k, t) for mo-
mentum k and PES

(cid:90)

ρ(E, t) =

dΩ|a(k, t)|2|k|2

(E = |k|2/2),

(13)

can in principle be approximately calculated by project-
ing the outgoing wave packet residing outside a given
radius Rs onto the plane wave (2π)−3/2 exp(ik · r) at a
time t suﬃciently after the pulse. Then, PMA is given
by,

a(k, t) = (cid:104)χk(r, t)|ˆθ(Rs)|Ψ(t)(cid:105) ,

(cid:90)

(14)

(15)

(16)

where χk(r, t) denotes the Volkov wave function and θ(x)
the Heaviside function.

On the other hand, the tSURFF method calculates
PES by a time integration of the wave function surface
ﬂux, based on an assumption that the nuclear potential
does not aﬀect the time evolution of the distant photo-
electron wave packet. Under this assumption, the Volkov
wave functions and photoelectron wave packets in the re-
gion |r| > Rs are evolved by the same nuclear-potential-
free Hamiltonian

hs = −

1
2

∇2 − iA(t) · ∇.

(17)

By taking time derivative of Eq. (14), we obtain the EOM
of the momentum amplitude,

−i

∂
∂t

a(k, t) = (cid:104)χk(t)|[hs, θ(Rs)]|Ψ(t)(cid:105) .

(18)

As shown in Ref. [13], since all the terms appearing in
the commutator [hs, θ(Rs)] contain delta functions δ(r −
Rs) [see Eq. (28) below], wave functions and their spatial
derivative only on the surface |r| = Rs are required to
solve Eq. (18). Hence, it is no longer needed to keep
the whole wave function and allowed to use an absorbing
boundary, which leads to a signiﬁcant computational cost
reduction.

In the momentum space, its elements are given by,

(cid:90)

˜P (k, k(cid:48)) =

drdr(cid:48) (cid:104)χk(t)|r(cid:48)(cid:105) P (r, r(cid:48)) (cid:104)r|χk(t)(cid:105)

(cid:88)

(cid:104)χk(t)| θ(Rs) |ψp(cid:105) Dp

q (cid:104)ψq| θ(Rs) |χk(cid:48) (t)(cid:105) .

(20)

The diagonal part ˜P (k, k) is interpreted as photoelectron
momentum distribution, and, then, PES is given by,

(cid:90)

ρ(E) =

dΩ ˜P (k, k)|k|2.

(21)

A similar deﬁnition of the PRDM as Eq. (20) and the di-
rect projection onto scattering states were used to com-
pute photoelectron spectrum in Ref. [21].

B. EOMs of momentum amplitudes of orbitals

In this subsection, we derive the EOM of the momen-

tum amplitude of orbital p,

ap(k, t) = (cid:104)χk(t)|θ(Rs)|ψp(cid:105) ,

(22)

which appears in Eq. (20). We assume that the nu-
clear potentials are negligible for photoelectrons as in the
single-electron case and additionally that the interelec-
tronic Coulomb interaction does not aﬀect the dynamics
of photoelectrons in the region beyond the radius Rs.
Then, the orbital EOM Eq. (7) can be approximated as,

(cid:34)

|ψp(cid:105) (cid:39) −i

ˆhs |ψp(cid:105) −

d

(23)

so that EOMs of ap(k) is obtained as

(24)

It should be noted that the second term in Eq. (24) repre-
sents a signiﬁcant diﬀerence from the single-electron case
[Eq. (18)]. This term includes the eﬀect of the interelec-
tronic Coulomb interaction inside Rs and is not negligi-
ble; for example, the phase variation due to the energy
of the ionic core is reﬂected in photoelectron momentum
spectra through this term.

It may not be a priori obvious if the Coulomb interac-
tion between electrons in the outer region is negligible. A
numerical validation of this approximation will be given
in Sec. V.

sorbing boundary, inﬁnite-range exterior complex scaling
is implemented [17, 18], which shows high eﬃciency and
accuracy. On the other hand, we discretize the orbital
momentum amplitudes with grid points in the spherical
coordinates, where the Volkov wave function for a mo-
mentum k = (k, θk, ψk) is given by,

χk(r, t) =

with jl(kr) being the spherical Bessel function of the ﬁrst

In this subsection, we describe the implementation of
the tSURFF method to TD-MCSCF simulations. The
implementation is based on our TD-CASSCF code [22]
for atoms subject to a laser pulse linearly polarized in the
z direction. The orbitals are discretized with spherical

to the z-polarization of the laser pulse [22]. As an ab-

Using Eqs. (26) and (27) and introducing gp

We integrate Eq. (24) with the ﬁrst order exponential

We compute exp[i∆tX(t)] by directly diagonalizing X(t)
at every time step, which is not demanding since the size
of X(t) is [Norb × Norb] and the number of orbitals Norb
usually falls within the range from a several to several
tens.

(35)

where I0 is a peak intensity, T is a period at the central
frequency ω = 2π/T , and Nopt is the total number of
optical cycles.

A. Ne atom

We ﬁrst calculate the PES of a neon atom subject to an
attosecond pulse with a peak intensity of 2.5×1012W/m2,
a wavelength of 12.398 nm corresponding to 100 eV pho-
ton energy, and Nopt = 16. The results by tSURFF and
direct projection on plane waves are compared. As an
absorbing boundary we use irECS with a scaling radius
R0 of 40 a.u for tSURFF and 400 a.u for direct projec-
tion. The latter is large enough to hold the departing
wave packet from two-photon ionization. Rs = 40 a.u.
for tSURFF, and the wave packet outside this radius is
used for projection.

We do TD-CASSCF simulations with 3 kinds of or-
bital classiﬁcations (nfc, ndc, na) = (0, 0, 5), (0, 0, 9), and
(1, 0, 8), where nfc, ndc, and na are the number of frozen-
core, dynamical-core, and active orbitals, respectively.
Note that the ﬁrst and second correspond to the time-
dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) [25] and MCTDHF
methods, respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 1.
We see single photon ionization peaks (around 30 - 90
eV) and two photon above threshold ionization (ATI)
peaks (around 130 eV - 190eV) from 2s and 2p orbitals.
The agreement between the results by tSURFF and di-
rect projection is excellent. This shows the validity of
the neglect of the electron-electron and nucleus-electron
Coulomb interaction beyond Rs assumed in tSURFF.
While the single photon ionization peaks from 2s and 2p
orbitals are expected to be at 51.5 and 78.4 eV, respec-
tively, based on the experimental values of the binding
energies [26], the peaks in the calculated spectra are lo-
cated at 47.5 and 76.7 eV in Fig. 1(a), 48.9 and 77.9 eV in
(b), and 48.7 and 77.9 eV in (c), coming closer to the ex-
perimental positions with increasing number of orbitals.
Otherwise, TDHF gives results similar to the MCTDHF
and TD-CASSCF ones for this process.

ject to an attosecond pulse with 100eV photon energy cal-
culated with orbital classiﬁcation (a) (nfc, ndc, na) = (0, 0, 5)
(TDHF), (b) (0, 0, 9) (MCTDHF), and (c) (1, 0, 8) (TD-
CASSCF). The results by tSURFF and direct projection are
compared.

B. Ar atom

Next, we simulate ATI of a Ar atom subject to an in-
tense visible laser pulse using the TD-ORMAS method
and discuss the eﬀect of electronic correlation. We
consider a pulse, which has a peak intensity of 2.0 ×
1014 W/cm2, a wavelength of 532 nm, and a pulse width
of Nopt = 14 optical cycles. The ponderomotive energy
Up is 5.285 eV. The temporal shape and energy spectrum
of the pulse are shown in Fig. 2.

Here, we subdivide na active orbitals into 4 and (na−4)
orbitals, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3 for orbital
decomposition (nc, nd, na) = (5, 0, 13). By setting the
maximum number of electrons in the second subgroup

Figure 4 shows PES calculated with diﬀerent orbital
classiﬁcations. We can recognize the direct cutoﬀ at 2Up
and rescattering cutoﬀ at 10Up. In Fig. 4(a), the results
with diﬀerent numbers of active orbitals within single
and double (SD) excitation are compared. The spectrum
is nearly converged with 25 and 29 active orbitals. Fig-
ure 4(b) compares the results with SD and SDT excita-
tion restriction and full CI (TD-CASSCF), with 13 active
orbitals. The SDT and full CI results almost overlap each
other, indicating that SDT is suﬃcient for numerical con-
vergence. Thus, the result using 25 active orbitals with
SDT excitation is expected to be numerically nearly ex-
act. Then, in Fig. 4(c), we compare the PES calculated
using 13, 20 and 25 active orbitals with SDT excitation
restriction and also the TDHF result. The peak positions
slightly depend on the number of orbitals, as we have also
seen in Fig. 1. Moreover, in the TDHF case, the peaks
are signiﬁcantly broadened. The ATI peak position En
corresponding to n-photon absorption is given by,

En = n(cid:126)ω − Ip − Up,

(36)

where Ip is the ionization potential. The diﬀerence in
peak position observed in Fig. 4 can be attributed to that
in Ip, which depends on the number of orbitals and exci-
tation restriction. In addition, in mean-ﬁeld approaches

ORMAS method for an Ar atom with 18 electrons, which
wave function is composed of 5 frozen cores and 13 active
orbitals, (nc, nd, na) = (5, 0, 13). The excitation restrictions

and triple, · · · ) excitation from the blue to red group are only
allowed.

such as TDHF, the ionization potential eﬀectively in-
creases as ionization proceeds and the electron density
near the nucleus decreases [27]. This results in the peak
broadening.

Finally, in Fig. 5, we compare ARPES calculated with
the TD-ORMAS method using 25 active orbitals with
SDT excitation restriction and with the TDHF method
using 4 dynamical-core orbitals. We see diﬀerence in de-
tailed structure.
In particular, the high-order (> 2Up)
rescattering contribution has much broader angular dis-
tribution in the TD-ORMAS result. The diﬀerence can
also be clearly observed in Fig 6, which shows the photo-
electron angular distribution (PAD) at 10 eV (< 2Up)
and 40 eV (> 2Up), representatives of the lower and
higher energy regions, respectively. At 10 eV photoelec-
tron energy, where the main contribution is from direct
ionization, all the results exhibit similar behavior. In con-
trast, at 40 eV photoelectron energy, for which rescatter-
ing from the parent ion is involved and thus strong elec-
tron correlation is expected, the calculated PAD varies
with the number of orbitals till it approximately con-
verges with na = 25. Especially, the TDHF method sig-
niﬁcantly underestimates the yield in the direction (90◦)
perpendicular to the laser polarization. This indicates
that electronic correlation is non-negligible in detailed
discussion of ATI ARPES.

VI. SUMMARY

FIG. 5. Angle-resolved photoelectron energy spectra of a Ar
atom subject to a visible intense laser pulse with a wavelength
of 532 nm and an intensity of 2.0×1014 W/cm2. The laser po-
larization (z direction) corresponds to 0◦. (a) (nfc, ndc, na) =
(5, 4, 0), i.e., TDHF (b) (nfc, ndc, na) = (5, 0, 25) and SDT
excitation restriction.

We have presented a successful numerical implementa-
tion of tSURFF to the TD-MCSCF (TD-CASSCF and
TD-ORMAS) methods to extract angle-resolved photo-
electron energy spectra from laser-driven multielectron
atoms. We have derived the EOMs for photoelectron
momentum amplitudes of each orbital. To obtain PES
in systems described within the MCSCF framework, the
photoelectron reduced density matrix has been intro-
duced, whose diagonal elements in the momentum space
correspond to PES. Since one of the biggest beneﬁts of
tSURFF is no need to hold the complete wave function
within the simulation box, it allows combined use of an
eﬃcient absorbing boundary such as irECS [17, 18].

We have applied the present implementation to Ne and
Ar atoms subject to attosecond XUV pulses and intense

visible laser pulses, respectively. We have demonstrated
converged calculation of ATI spectra from Ar including
electronic correlation, which would be prohibitive with-
out tSURFF and irECS. It is expected that this achieve-
ment enables direct comparison with experiments and
precise prediction of high-ﬁeld and ultrafast phenomena.

While we have presented the application of tSURFF to
TD-MCSCF methods in this study, it is straightforward
to extend it to other multielectron ab initio methods us-
ing time-dependent orbitals such as the time-dependent
optimized coupled-cluster method [28] and TD-MCSCF
methods including nuclear dynamics [29]. Such appli-
cations would enable us to compute ARPES from even
more complicated systems and processes.
