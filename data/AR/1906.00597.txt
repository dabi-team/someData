The possibility of the 14C cluster being a basic building block of medium mass nuclei is discussed.
Although α cluster structures have been widely discussed in the light N ≈ Z mass region, the neutron
to proton ratio deviates from unity in the nuclei near β-stability line and in neutron-rich nuclei.
Thus, more neutron-rich objects with N > Z could become the building blocks of cluster structures
in such nuclei. The 14C nucleus is strongly bound and can be regarded as such a candidate. In
addition, the path to the lowest shell-model conﬁguration at short relative distances is closed for the
14C+14C structure contrary to the case of the 12C+12C structure; this allows to keep appreciable
separation distance between the 14C clusters. The recent development of antisymmetrized quasi-
cluster model (AQCM) allows us to utilize jj-coupling shell model wave function for each cluster
in a simpliﬁed way. The AQCM results for the 14C+14C structure in 28Mg are compared with
the ones of cranked relativistic mean ﬁeld (CRMF) calculations. Although theoretical frameworks
of these two models are quite diﬀerent, they give similar results for the nucleonic densities and
rotational properties of the structure under investigation. The existence of linear chain three 14C
cluster structure in 42Ar has also been predicted in AQCM. These results conﬁrm the role of the
14C cluster as a possible building block of cluster structures in medium mass nuclei.

The α cluster structures have been extensively studied
over the years [1, 2]. Since the binding energy per nu-
cleon is extremely large in 4He, it can be a building block
of the nuclear systems called α cluster. Also, the rela-
tive interaction between the α clusters is weak, which is
another condition for the appearance of the cluster struc-
tures. For example, 8Be is not bound but its ground state
has a developed α+α cluster structure. The candidates
for α cluster states have been widely discussed in other
light 4N (N is integer here) nuclei [3]. This is illustrated
by a few examples below. The second 0+ state of 12C
at Ex = 7.65 MeV, located just above the threshold en-
ergy to the decay into three α’s, has a developed three-α
cluster structure and plays a crucial role in the forma-
tion of 12C in stars [4]. In 16O, the ﬁrst excited state at
Ex = 6.05 MeV, located very close to the threshold of the
decay into 12C and 4He, can be interpreted as 12C+4He
cluster state. It has been known as the mysterious 0+
state; the reproduction of this state based on the stan-
dard picture (shell-model approaches) is still a big chal-
lenge. Various cluster structures have been proposed also
in 20Ne, 24Mg, and 44Ti etc. [1–3].

The description of such cluster structures has been at-
tempted in simple cluster models. However, it is well
known that non-central nuclear interactions are very im-
portant in nuclear systems and their eﬀects cannot be
taken into account in simple α cluster models. With in-
creasing mass number, the symmetry of the jj-coupling
shell model dominates the nuclear structure, and sub-
closure conﬁgurations of j-shells, f7/2, g9/2, and h11/2
become important, corresponding to the magic numbers
of 28, 50, and 126 [5]. Indeed the observation of these
magic numbers is the evidence that the spin-orbit interac-
tion strongly contributes in the medium and heavy mass

regions, and this interaction is known to play a substan-
tial role in breaking the α clusters [6].

Therefore, it is natural to think about a diﬀerent ob-
ject as a cluster in the study of medium mass nuclei.
Here one should also consider that neutron to proton ra-
tio of stable nuclei deviates from unity with increasing
mass number. Thus, there is the possibility that more
neutron-rich object could be a building block of cluster
structures. In this study, we discuss the possibility that
the 14C nucleus could be a cluster. This can be justiﬁed
by the following arguments.

First of all, 14C is strongly bound. This is because
the proton number 6 corresponds to the subclosure of
the p3/2 subshell of the jj-coupling shell model, and the
neutron number 8 is the magic number corresponding to
the closure of the p shell. Although 14C has two valence
neutrons, the lowest threshold to emit particle is the neu-
tron threshold at Ex = 8.18 MeV, which is high enough
value. In addition, because of strong shell eﬀects, there is
no excited state below Ex = 6 MeV just like in 16O. The
β-decay of free 14C is very slow reﬂecting the stability of
this nucleus. Thus, 14C is a famous nucleus used for the
age determination [7]. The second argument is the fol-
lowing: although the single 14C nucleus is β-unstable, the
line connecting the origin of the nuclear landscape and
the point of 6 protons and 8 neutrons (corresponding to
14C) on the nuclear chart, which has N/Z ∼ 1.3, ex-
trapolates into β-stability line above Z ≈ 40. The third
argument is that it is well known that 14C is emitted from
some of heavy nuclei [such as 221−224,226Ra, 223,225Ac and
221Fr (see Ref. [8])] in the process which is called cluster
decay [9]. In reality, there is much more experimental
data for the 14C emission as compared with the emission
of 12C in medium and heavy mass nuclei, and neutron

 
 
 
 
 
 
richness of 14C can be important for that. These ex-
perimental data also strongly suggest that 14C can be a
building block of cluster structures in heavy nuclei. Fi-
nally, contrary to the case of the 12C+12C cluster struc-
ture, the path to the lowest shell-model conﬁguration is
closed at short relative distances in the 14C+14C cluster
structure. This factor leads to appreciable distance be-
tween the 14C clusters and it is a subject of the present
study.

in Refs.

In this Letter, the appearance of 14C cluster struc-
tures is investigated and the predictions obtained in the
cluster and mean ﬁeld approaches are compared. The
protons of 14C correspond to the subclosure of p3/2 in
the jj-coupling shell model. The jj-coupling shell model
wave functions can be easily prepared starting from the
[10–20], the antisymmetrized
cluster model;
quasi-cluster model (AQCM), which allows to smoothly
transform α cluster model wave functions to jj-coupling
shell model ones and incorporate the eﬀects of the spin-
orbit interaction, has been proposed. A reliable nucleon-
nucleon interaction, which includes both the cluster and
shell features in the light and medium mass nuclei, is
inevitably needed. The Tohsaki interaction, which has
ﬁnite range three-body terms [10, 20–22], is employed
here. Although this is a phenomenological interaction, it
provides a reasonable size and binding energy for the α
cluster and reproduces α+α scattering phase shifts. In
addition, it describes the saturation properties of nuclear
matter rather well.

In AQCM, each single-particle wave function is de-

scribed by a Gaussian,

φ =

h

χ,

(1)

where the Gaussian center parameter ζ shows the ex-
pectation value of the position of the particle, and χ is
the spin-isospin wave function. The size parameter ν is
set to 0.17 fm−2 for 28Mg (two 14C) and 42Ar (three
14C). The Slater determinant in the conventional Brink
model [1] is constructed from these single particle wave
functions by antisymmetrizing them. Here, four single
particle wave functions with diﬀerent spin and isospin
sharing a common Gaussian center parameter ζ corre-
spond to an α cluster. In the conventional cluster models,
there is no spin-orbit eﬀect for the α clusters. Thus, they
are changed into quasi-clusters based on AQCM [10–19].
According to AQCM, when the original position of one
of the particles (the value of Gaussian center parameter)
is R, the Gaussian center parameter of this nucleon is
transformed by adding the imaginary part as

ζ = R + iΛespin × R,

(2)

where espin is a unit vector for the intrinsic-spin orienta-
tion of this nucleon. It has been previously shown that
the lowest conﬁgurations of the jj-coupling shell model
can be achieved by Λ = 1 and R → 0 for all the nucle-
ons [16].

2

For the description of 14C, at ﬁrst, di-nucleon clus-
ters are prepared;
in each di-nucleon cluster, two nu-
cleons with opposite spin and same isospin are sharing
common Gaussian center parameters. Four di-nucleon
clusters with a tetrahedron conﬁguration (the distance
between two di-neutron clusters is parameterized as R)
and small relative distances (R → 0) corresponds to the
closure of the p-shell, which is introduced for the neu-
tron part. In the calculations, R is set to 0.1 fm. For the
proton part, three di-proton clusters with equilateral tri-
angular conﬁguration and small distance between them
are introduced, and the imaginary parts of the Gaussian
center parameters are given as Λ = 1 in Eq. (2), which
correspond to the subclosure of the p3/2 shell [10, 15].

For the analysis based on AQCM, the Hamiltonian
consists of kinetic energy and potential energy terms, and
the potential energy has central, spin-orbit, and Coulomb
parts. For the central part, the Tohsaki interaction [21]
is adopted, which has ﬁnite range three-body nucleon-
nucleon interaction terms in addition to two-body terms.
This interaction is designed to reproduce both saturation
properties and scattering phase shifts of two α clusters.
For the spin-orbit part, the spin-orbit term of the G3RS
interaction [23], which is a realistic interaction originally
developed to reproduce the nucleon-nucleon scattering
phase shifts, is adopted. The combination of these two
has been well investigated [19, 20].

ted line) and 14C+14C (28Mg, solid line) measured from the
threshold energies. The dashed curve corresponds to the 0+
energy curve of 16O+16O (32S). The threshold energies are
estimated by adopting the optimal R and Λ values for the
free 12C, 14C, and 16O nuclei with the size parameter of
ν = 0.2 fm

−2.

We start the discussion with the comparison of the
12C+12C and 14C+14C systems. The energy curves of
the 0+ states of these two systems measured from the
threshold energies are shown in Fig. 1. It is conﬁrmed
that the minimum energy is much lower than the thresh-
old in the case of the 12C+12C system (dotted line). The

 
 
 
 
 
optimal distance is rather small, around 2 fm. According
to the jj-coupling shell model, the small distance limit of
two 12C corresponds to the lowest conﬁguration of 24Mg.
This means that the path going to the ground state after
the fusion is opened for the 12C+12C system. This sit-
uation is diﬀerent in the case of 14C+14C system (solid
line). Small distance limit of two 14C does not corre-
spond to the lowest jj-coupling shell model wave func-
tion of 28Mg. As a result, the minimum energy appears
somewhat below the threshold. This result suggests the
possibility that 14C clusters keep the relative distance
(∼4 fm), which is much larger than in the case of the
12C+12C system, and form a developed cluster structure.
The dashed line is for the energy of the 16O+16O system
measured from the threshold.
In this case, again the
path going to the ground state is closed, which works
for the appearance of a well-developed cluster structure.
However, the energy is much higher than the threshold
because of large Coulomb repulsion. The 16O+16O struc-
ture of 32S has been discussed for years [24], but it has
been known that the 16O+16O cluster component corre-
sponds to highly excited states [25]. The possibility of
the existence of highly excited superdeformed bands in
32S based on the 16O+16O structure has also been dis-
cussed in density functional theories [26–28]. In the case
of 14C+14C system, the state appears around the thresh-
old because of smaller Coulomb repulsion.

An alternative way to look on clustering in nuclei is
through the prism of density functional theories (DFT).
Both relativistic and non-relativistic DFTs have been ap-
plied to the investigation of this phenomenon in nuclei
(see Refs. [28, 29] and references quoted therein). The
advantage of the DFT framework is the fact that it does

3

not assume the existence of cluster structures; the for-
mation of cluster structures proceeds from microscopic
single-nucleon degrees of freedom via many-body corre-
lations [29–32]. As a result, the DFT framework allows
the simultaneous treatment of cluster and mean-ﬁeld-
type states.

This is a reason why cranked relativistic mean ﬁeld
(CRMF) approach (see Ref.
[33]) is also used in the
present manuscript for the study of clusterization in
28Mg. This approach has been successfully employed for
the study of both the clusterization in light nuclei ranging
from 12C up to 50Ti [28, 32, 34–37] and of the rotation of
light, medium and heavy mass nuclei (see Ref. [33] and
references quoted therein). In the CRMF approach the
nucleus is described as a system of pointlike nucleons,
Dirac spinors, coupled to mesons and to the photons (see
Ref. [33]). The nucleons interact by the exchange of sev-
eral mesons, namely, a scalar meson σ and three vector
particles, ω, ρ and the photon. The CRMF calculations
are performed with the NL3* functional [38].

Figure 2 shows calculated energies of the lowest con-
ﬁgurations in 28Mg. The conﬁgurations are labeled by
shorthand [p, n] labels where p (n) is the number of oc-
cupied N = 3 proton (neutron) intruder orbitals (here N
is principal quantum number). The ground state band
[0,0] has no such orbitals occupied and it has quadrupole
deformation of β2 = 0.34 at spin I = 0. As discussed in
Ref. [28], such normal deformed band has limited angular
momentum content and it terminates in purely single-
particle state at I = 8. Subsequent particle-hole ex-
citations lead to rotational bands with structure [0,1],
[0,2], [1,2], [2,2], ..., which have larger angular momen-
tum content (see Fig. 2) and larger deformation. Neutron
densities of selected states of these rotational bands are
shown in Fig. 3. The density distribution of the [0,2] con-
ﬁguration at spin I = 0 (Fig. 3 (a)) corresponds to the
14C+14C cluster structure and it is similar (especially in
high-density region) to the one obtained in the AQCM
(Fig. 3 (c)). In both calculations, the 14C+14C distance
is approximately equal to 4 fm.

However, this cluster structure behaves diﬀerently as
a function of the spin in the CRMF and AQCM calcula-
tions. This is illustrated in the insert to Fig. 2 which
shows the moments of inertia of the 14C+14C cluster
structure as a function of the spin.
In the CRMF cal-
culations, the moment of inertia is gradually decreasing
with spin. This is due to two factors: the decrease of
quadrupole deformation and washing out of clusteriza-
tion with increasing spin which is generally observed in
DFTs calculations (see Refs. [28, 32]). The comparison
of the densities at spins I = 0 and 16 illustrates the latter
feature (see Figs. 3 (a) and (b)). On the contrary, the
moments of inertia are somewhat smaller in the AQCM
calculations and they stay almost constant up to I = 8.
Note that in AQCM it is assumed that cluster structure
persists even at highest calculated spins. In the light of
distinct predictions of these two models, the experimen-
tal observation of the superdeformed band built on the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14C+14C structure would be extremely useful for clari-
ﬁcation of existing diﬀerences in the description of clus-
terization in the DFT and cluster-originating models.

Note that in the CRMF calculations the [0,2] conﬁgu-
ration, representing the 14C+14C cluster structure, plays
a role of a basic building block of more elongated clus-
ter structures with the [1,2] conﬁgurations, which are
created by means of particle-hole excitations. At spin
zero, the total (proton + neutron) quadrupole deforma-
tions of the [0,2] and [1,2] conﬁgurations are 0.81 and
0.89, respectively. The density of the [1,2] conﬁguration
is shown in Fig. 3 (d). The diﬀerences in the density
distributions of the [0,2] and [1,2] conﬁgurations are due
to proton particle-hole excitation from the 3/2[211] or-
bital into 1/2[330] one. These orbitals have diﬀerent
spatial distributions of the single-particle density (see
Ref. [32, 39] for details) and thus such a particle-hole
excitation moves density from the middle part of the nu-
cleus to the polar region leading to a more elongated
shape (compare Fig. 3 (d) with Fig. 3 (a)). Note that
there are two [1,2] conﬁgurations which are signature
degenerated up to I ∼ 10 because of the degeneracies
of the 3/2[211](r = ±i) orbitals. Subsequent particle-
hole excitations, leading to the [2,2] conﬁguration with
quadrupole deformations of 1.13 at spin zero, partially
suppress 14C+14C cluster structure and form ellipsoidal-
like density distribution.

tions, while panel (c) the densities of the 14C+14C structure
obtained in the AQCM calculations. The density colormap
starts at ρ = 0.005 fm−3 and shows the densities in fm−3.

Next, we consider the case of linear chain structure of
three 14C clusters (14C+14C+14C) in 42Ar. The energy
curves for such a structure are shown in Fig. 4 as a func-
tion of the 14C+14C distance. The AQCM solutions for

4

the states with angular momentum ranging from I = 0
up to I = 8 are shown in this ﬁgure. Similar to the case
of cluster 14C+14C structure in 28Mg, the minima of the
energy curves are obtained around the threshold energy
with the relative distance of the 14C clusters being ap-
proximately equal to ∼4 fm. The moment of inertia of
the calculated rotational band is 15.59 MeV−1. In the
future, one should investigate the stability of the linear
chain state against the bending motion. Even if it is not
stable against the bending motion at spin zero, there is a
possibility that it becomes stabilized when large angular
momentum is given to the system. This is because it is
well known that rotation can stabilize elongated shapes
owing to the centrifugal force [35–37].

In conclusion, the possibility that 14C can be a build-
ing block of cluster structures in medium mass nuclei
has been investigated for the ﬁrst time. On going from
light to heavier nuclei, the beta-stability line gradually
evolves from N ∼ Z to N ∼ 1.3Z. This suggests that
the nuclei with similar neutron to proton ratio can be
the building blocks of cluster structures in medium mass
nuclei. The 14C nucleus is such a candidate since it has
N/Z = 1.33. It is strongly bound and reveals itself as a
cluster in the 14C emission from actinides. Moreover, the
path to the lowest shell-model conﬁguration at short rel-
ative distances is closed in the 14C+14C structure, which
allows to keep the distance between the clusters approx-
imately equal to 4 fm. Despite underlying diﬀerences in
theoretical assumptions, the AQCM and CRMF calcula-
tions predict the existence of such a cluster structure in
28Mg. In addition, the possible existence of linear chain
14C+14C+14C cluster structure in 42Ar has been inves-
tigated within the framework of the AQCM approach.

 
 
 
 
These results strongly point to an important role of 14C
as a building block of cluster structures in medium mass
nuclei.
