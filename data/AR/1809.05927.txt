The properties of deexcitation of the same 220Th compound nucleus (CN) formed by diﬀerent
mass (charge) asymmetric reactions are investigated. It is demonstrated that the eﬀective ﬁssion
barrier < Bﬁs > value being a function of the excitation energy E∗
CN is strongly sensitive to the var-
ious orbital angular momentum L = (cid:96)(cid:126) distributions of CN formed with the same excitation energy
E∗
CN by the very diﬀerent entrance channels 16O+204Pb, 40Ar+180Hf, 82Se+138Ba and 96Zr+124Sn.
Consequently, the competition between the ﬁssion and evaporation of light particles (neutron, pro-
ton, and α-particle) processes along the deexcitation cascade of CN depends on the orbital angular
momentum distribution of CN. Therefore, the ratio between the evaporation residue cross sections
obtained after emission of neutral and charged particles and neutrons only for the same CN with a
given excitation energy E∗
CN is sensitive to the mass (charge) asymmetry of reactants in the entrance
channel.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known to the scientiﬁc community that in
heavy ion collisions, at low energies, the complexity of
processes preceding the formation of reaction products
strongly inﬂuences their properties and nature, and that
due to very transient characteristics of these processes it
is impossible to observe how they occur. Moreover, in the
reactions there are products that are strongly determined
by the ﬁrst stage of the collision between the projectile
and target nuclei leading to the capture of reactants and
then to the evolution of the dinuclear system (DNS) [1]
up to the formation of products of the quasiﬁssion pro-
cess in competition with the ones of the complete fusion
process. In this last case, the complete fusion stage can
lead to the fast ﬁssion (FF) products [2] (caused for an-
gular momentum values (cid:96) > (cid:96)cr since in this intervall
of (cid:96) the ﬁssion barrier Bﬁs is zero, and the deformed
mononucleus breaks down into two fragments without to
reach the compound nucleus (CN) stage), and to reac-
tion products caused by the deexcitation of CN leading
to the formation of fusion-ﬁssion fragments in competi-
tion with the evaporation residue (ER) nuclei reached af-
ter light particle emissions surviving ﬁssion [2–6] at each
step of the cascade. In this complex context, many ER
nuclei can not be detected and identiﬁed due to concrete
limits of experimental apparata and/or analysis of data.
Therefore, in the analysis of experimental data there are

unavoidable uncertainties on the identiﬁcation and sep-
aration of the products that are formed in each step of
the reaction process. Of course, also in calculation of the
theoretical models there are serious uncertainties on the
obtained results due to the assumptions made in the pro-
cedures and use of phenomenological models. In this pa-
per, we present a detailed analysis and comparison of cal-
culated results obtained by the study of the 16O+204Pb,
40Ar+180Hf, 82Se+138Ba, and 96Zr+124Sn very diﬀerent
mass asymmetry reactions (with mass asymmetry pa-
rameter η=0.86, 0.64, 0.26, and 0.13, respectively) lead-
ing to the same 220Th CN. These reactions are character-
ized by various values of the threshold excitation energy
E∗
CN due to diﬀerent reaction barrier energies[3] of about
27.8, 35.5, 12, and 17.5 MeV, respectively, caused by dif-
ferent values of repulsive Coulomb and centrifugal rota-
tional potentials and the attractive nuclear interaction.
Since the reaction products formed at deexcitation cas-
cade of CN are the evaporation residues after neutrons
and charged particle emissions in competition with the
ﬁssion process, it is interesting to analyze the eﬀects re-
lated to the various deexcitation modes of the same CN
with the same excitation energy E∗
CN, since the formed
CN is characterized by a speciﬁc angular momentum dis-
tribution due to the diﬀerent mass (charge) asymmetry
in the entrance channel.

II. METHOD

† nasirov@jinr.ru

The study of heavy ion collisions near the Coulomb
barrier energies is based on calculations of the incoming

 
 
 
 
 
 
path of projectile nucleus and ﬁnding the capture prob-
ability, taking into account the possibility of interaction
with diﬀerent orientation angles of the axial symmetry
axis of deformed nuclei [4]. Moreover, the surface vi-
bration of the nuclei, which are spherical in the ground
state and deformed shape in the ﬁrst excited 2+ state,
is taken into consideration. The ﬁnal results are aver-
aged over all orientation angles the axial symmetry axis
of deformed nuclei or vibrational states of the spherical
nuclei. These procedures are presented in the Appendix
A and Appendix B of the papers [2, 3].

The capture of the projectile by the target is charac-
terized by the full momentum transfer of the relative mo-
mentum into the intrinsic degrees of freedom and shape
deformation. The capture occurs if the following neces-
sary and suﬃcient conditions are satisﬁed. The necessary
condition of capture is overcoming the Coulomb barrier
by projectile nucleus to be trapped in the potential well
of the potential energy surface (PES). The collision dy-
namics is calculated by the solution of the equations of
the relative distance R and angular momentum (cid:96)[2, 3].

The condition of suﬃciency for capture is the decrease
of the relative kinetic energy due to dissipation by fric-
tion forces up to values lower than the depth of the po-
tential well [7–9]. The potential well is formed due to
the competition of the short range nuclear attractive and
the Coulomb and centrifugal repulsive potentials. This
condition depends on the values of the beam energy and
orbital angular momentum, the size of the potential well
and intensity of the friction forces that cause dissipation
of the kinetic energy of the relative motions to internal
energy of two nuclei. So, the trapping of the collision
path in the well means that the capture has occurred
and the DNS is formed. The lifetime of the DNS is de-
termined by its excitation energy E∗
DNS and by the size of
the potential well. The height of the inner barrier of the
potential well is called the quasiﬁssion barrier Bqf in our
approach. This deﬁnition is related to the quasiﬁssion
process: in this case the DNS decays without reaching the
equilibrated shape of a compound nucleus [8–10]. The al-
ternative to the quasiﬁssion process in the evolution of
DNS is the complete fusion of its constituent fragments.
According to this scenario the partial capture cross sec-
tion σ(cid:96)
cap for a given relative energy in the center-of-mass
system Ec.m. and angular momentum value (cid:96) is the sum
fus and quasiﬁssion σ(cid:96)
of the partial complete fusion σ(cid:96)

cross sections [11];

cap(Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2) = σ(cid:96)
σ(cid:96)
+ σ(cid:96)

fus(Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2)
qf (Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2).

(1)

The capture cross section is determined by the number
of partial waves which lead to the path of the total energy
of colliding nuclei to be trapped in the well of the nucleus-
nucleus potential after dissipation of a suﬃcient part of
the initial kinetic energy. The size of the potential well
decreases with increasing orbital angular momentum (cid:96).

2

Therefore, the capture cross section is calculated by the
formula

σcap(Ec.m.; α1, α2) =

(cid:96)d(Ec.m.)
(cid:88)

(cid:96)=0

σ(cid:96)

(2)

the complete fusion (CF) cross section is obtained as

σCF(Ec.m.; α1, α2) =

(cid:96)d(Ec.m.)
(cid:88)

(cid:96)=0
CF (Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2),

(3)

and the quasiﬁssion cross section at the stage of DNS is
obtained as

σqf (Ec.m.; α1, α2) =

(cid:96)d(Ec.m.)
(cid:88)

(cid:96)=0

σ(cid:96)
cap(Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2)

× [1 − P (cid:96)

CF (Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2)];

(4)

for details see [2]. Therefore, the part of complete fusion
reaching the compound nucleus formation is

σfus(Ec.m.; α1, α2) =

(cid:96)cr(cid:88)

σ(cid:96)
cap(Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2)

(cid:96)=0
× P (cid:96)
CF (Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2),

(5)

while the part going in fast ﬁssion is

σﬀ (Ec.m.; α1, α2) =

(cid:96)d(Ec.m.)
(cid:88)

σ(cid:96)
cap(Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2)

(cid:96)=(cid:96)cr
CF (Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2).

× P (cid:96)

(6)

In relation (2) λ is the de Broglie wavelength of the
entrance channel and P (cid:96)
cap(Ec.m., (cid:96); α1, α2) is the cap-
ture probability which depends on the collision dynamics:
P (cid:96)
cap is 1 at (cid:96)min ≤ (cid:96) ≤ (cid:96)d, while is 0 if (cid:96) < (cid:96)min or (cid:96) > (cid:96)d.
That means the (cid:96) possible values leading to capture
can form in some cases a “window” of angular momen-
tum values because the friction coeﬃcient is not so strong
to trap the projectile in the potential well. Moreover, the
maximal value of partial waves ((cid:96)d) leading to capture is
calculated by the solution of the equations of the rela-
tive motion of nuclei [7, 8, 12], and (cid:96)min is the minimal
value of (cid:96) leading to capture. In relation (3), P (cid:96)
CF rep-
resents the complete fusion probability that the excited
DNS -through the exchange of nucleons between the two
interacting nuclei- evolves towards the complete fusion
in competition the quasiﬁssion process that instead con-
sists in the separation of the two constituent nuclei. The
fusion probability is strongly dependent on the values of
the intrinsic fusion barrier B∗
fus and quasiﬁssion barrier
B∗
qf , both sensitive to some parameters of the reaction.
For any details see [2, 3, 13].

III. ROLE OF THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM
ON THE CN FORMATION AND ITS
DEEXCITATION

The role of the angular momentum distribution of the
entrance channel on the capture and fusion cross sections
and consequently on the evaporation residue products
was in general discussed in papers [2, 3]. The angular
momentum distribution of the partial fusion cross sec-
tion σ(cid:96)
fus versus (cid:96) for the four very diﬀerent mass (charge)
asymmetric reactions leading to the same 220Th CN
formed at the same excitation energy E∗
CN: 35.5, 46, and
61 MeV, respectively, is presented in Fig. 1. The choice
of 35.5 MeV as the lower E∗
CN value for which we can com-
pare the eﬀects of the angular momentum distribution for
the complete set of the four considered reaction is due
to the fact that for the 40Ar+180Hf reaction the thresh-
old energy for the DNS formation (and consequently to
reach the 220Th CN) is 35.5 MeV while for the other
three 16O+204Pb, 82Se+138Ba and 96Zr+124Sn reactions
the threshold energy values are lower (see Fig. 2). More-
over, for the 40Ar+180Hf asymmetry reaction (η=0.64)
the moment of inertia for dinuclear system JDNS is small,
therefore, at low energy of about E∗
CN =35.5 MeV only
collisions between 40Ar and 180Hf with angular momen-
tum (cid:96) ≤ 20(cid:126) lead to capture, since at the corresponding
energy of the center-of-mass Ec.m. entrance channel en-
ergy, the nucleus-nucleus interaction potential [3] V (R, (cid:96))
still forms a potential well up to (cid:96) = 20(cid:126). Consequently,
the partial fusion cross section σ(cid:96)
fus of the 220Th CN can
be contributed from (cid:96) = 0 to 20 (cid:126), while for (cid:96) > 20(cid:126) the
deep-inelastic collisions take place. Moreover, the com-
parison of the fusion excitation functions, calculated for
the considered reactions (see Fig. 2) shows only for the
40Ar+180Hf reaction a strong variation (more than 2 or-
ders of magnitude) in the range of the excitation energy
CN =35.5 - 55 MeV while the trends for the 16O+204Pb
E∗
and 96Zr+124Sn reactions are almost saturated or even
slightly decreasing for the 82Se+138Ba reaction.

It is seen in the panels of Fig. 1 the relevant diﬀer-
ences between the shapes of curves representing the par-
tial fusion excitation functions σ(cid:96)
fus for the four reactions
leading to the same 220Th CN with the same excitation
energy E∗
CN value and mainly between the diﬀerent angu-
lar momentum (cid:96) intervals that cover these σ(cid:96)
fus functions.
Obviously, the diﬀerent yields of the σ(cid:96)
fus functions are
related to the diﬀerent formations of the capture cross
section for the four reactions and, consequently, to the
σ(cid:96)
fus fusion cross section values corresponding to the ex-
citation energies of the compound nucleus E∗
CN of 35.5,
46 and 61 MeV, respectively. The speciﬁc shape of σ(cid:96)
fus
and range of (cid:96) of each reaction determines the relevant
diﬀerences in the type of the deexcitation of CN in the
diﬀerent reactions leading to the same CN with the same
excitation energy E∗

CN.

Our calculations of each step of reaction to study the

main properties of various processes have shown that:

1. The competition between the quasiﬁssion and com-

plete fusion processes at the deexcitation of DNS is
strongly sensitive to the characteristics of reactants

functions σ(cid:96)

respectively. The main role is played by the values

sion barrier that are both sensitive to the angular

still holds. For details see Appendix B of [2] regarding
the intrinsic and collective level density determinations,
where we also show the sensitivity of the model on ﬁnal
reaction products by using mass asymmetric and almost
symmetric reactants in the entrance channels.

The method of our study for the deexcitation of CN
does not use free parameters that can be changed for each
reaction, but it is rigorously applied to all reactions and
for any explored excitation energy range.

IV. RESULTS ON THE REACTIONS LEADING
TO THE 220TH CN

We study some properties of the deexcitation of the
220Th CN formed by four very diﬀerent mass (charge)
asymmetric and almost symmetric reactions in the en-
trance channel ( 16O+204Pb, 40Ar+180Hf, 82Se+138Ba
and 96Zr+124Sn) in a wide range of excitation energy
E∗

CN.
In panel a) of Fig. 3, we present the eﬀective ﬁssion
barrier < Bﬁs > versus the excitation energy E∗
CN for the
220Th∗ (full line) obtained in the 16O+204Pb very mass
asymmetric reaction. The same quantity calculated for
the 219Th∗ (dashed line), 218Th∗ (dotted line), 217Th∗
(dash-dotted line), and 216Th∗ (dash-double dotted line)
after emission of one, two, three and four neutrons from
220Th∗, respectively, are presented there.

The eﬀective ﬁssion barrier < Bﬁs > value of CN with
excited energy E∗
CN and any intermediate excited nucleus
with energy E∗ is obtained as the weighted average of
Bﬁs((cid:96), T ) by the partial σ(cid:96)
fus:

where the ﬁssion barrier Bﬁs((cid:96), T ) is:

In formula (8), T = (cid:112)E∗/a represents the nuclear tem-
perature where a is the intrinsic level density parameter,
and Bm
ﬁs is the part of the rotating liquid drop model
contribution to the ﬁssion barrier; while h(T ) and q((cid:96))
represent the damping functions of the nuclear shell cor-
rection δW by the increase of the excitation energy E∗
and angular momentum (cid:96), respectively,

h(T ) = {1 + exp[(T − T0)/d]}−1
q((cid:96)) = {1 + exp[((cid:96) − (cid:96)1/2)/∆(cid:96)]}−1.

In equation (9), d = 0.3 MeV is the rate of wash-
ing out the shell corrections with the temperature, and
T0 = 1.16 MeV is the value at which the damping fac-
tor h(T ) is reduced by 1/2. Analogously, in Eq. (10),
∆(cid:96) = 3(cid:126) is the rate of washing out the shell corrections
with the angular momentum, and (cid:96)1/2 = 20(cid:126) is the value
at which the damping factor q((cid:96)) is reduced by 1/2. It

3. The angular momentum distribution of the com-
pound nucleus determines the competition between
the deexcitation cascade of CN through the evapo-
ration of light particles (that can lead to the forma-
tion of ER nuclei with Zi and Ai values not very
diﬀerent from the Z and A numbers of CN) and
its ﬁssion to two fragments with the charge Zi and
and mass Ai numbers near Z/2 and A/2, where Z
and A are the atomic and mass numbers of CN,
respectively.

The probabilities of emission of light particles (n, p,
and α-particle) and ﬁssion processes are estimated by cal-
culations of Γn, Γp, Γα, and Γﬁs widths, respectively, for
each intermediate excited nucleus formed during the de-
excitation cascade starting from the CN. The widths are
determined by the corresponding level densities which are
function of the separation energies of emitted particles
and the ﬁssion barrier. Moreover, the shell corrections in
the ﬁssion barriers and the level densities ρ are damped
with functions depending on the excitation energies E∗ of
nuclei and orbital angular momentum (cid:96). The ﬁssion and
particle decay widths are calculated by considering the
collective enhancement coeﬃcients in the collective level
density in order to correctly take into account in addition
to the intrinsic excitations also the rotational and vibra-
tional states by the collective enhancement factors [2, 14].
Therefore, while the adiabatic approach for the estima-
tion of the collective enhancement in the level density
is acceptable only at very low excitation energies of few
MeV, at higher E∗
CN excitation energies it is necessary
to use the non-adiabatic approach for the correct estima-
tion of the collective level density ρnon−adiab.
(E∗, J). We
use a damping function q(E∗, β) with the aim to account
the coupling of the collective to the intrinsic degrees of
freedom due to the nuclear viscosity because it is rather
unlikely that at high energies the adiabatic assumption

is useful to note that the values of parameters d, T0,
(cid:96)1/2 and ∆(cid:96) used in the damping functions h(T ) and
q((cid:96)) are not changed in the study of heavy ion reactions
leading to heavy and superheavy nuclei. The parameters
d = 0.3 MeV and T0=1.16 MeV in the damping function
of the nuclear temperature were obtained by investiga-
tion of a very wide set of heavy ion reactions. The values
of parameters (cid:96)1/2 = 20(cid:126) and ∆(cid:96) = 3(cid:126) reduce the q((cid:96))
function from 0.9 to 0.1 in the 12-26(cid:126) interval conﬁrming
the important role of the q((cid:96)) damping function in deter-
mination of the eﬀective ﬁssion barrier < Bﬁs((cid:96), T ) >, as
explained in Fig. 18 of Appendix B of paper [2].

In our calculation, the intrinsic level density parameter
a is especially tailored to account for the shell eﬀects in
the level density [2]

(11)

where γ =0.0064 MeV−1 is the parameter which accounts
for the rate at which shell eﬀects wash out with excita-
tion energy for neutron or other light particle emission.
The general expression (11) works well also for deformed
prolate or oblate nuclei. Physically, the disappearance of
the shell eﬀects with E∗ excitation energy may be seen
as a rearrangement of the shell-model orbitals in such a
way that the shell gap between orbitals close to the Fermi
energy vanishes. In order to determine the aﬁs level den-
sity parameter in the ﬁssion channel we use the relation
af is(E∗) = an(E∗) × r(E∗) found in [14] where r(E∗) is
given by the relation

In our code, the ﬁssion and particle decay widths Γﬁs
and Γn,p,α are calculated by the formulas B1 and B2,
respectively, reported in Appendix B of paper [2].

Similarly to what was done in panel a), we present in
panels b), c), and d) of Fig. 3 the excitation functions
of < Bﬁs > for the 40Ar+180Hf asymmetric reaction,
82Se+138Ba almost symmetric reaction, and 96Zr+124Sn
symmetric reaction, respectively.

Moreover, the panels a), b), c), and d) of Fig. 4 present
the branching ratio of the calculated neutron emission
width results of excitation functions Γn/Γtot from the
excited 220Th∗, 219Th∗, 218Th∗, 217Th∗, and 216Th∗ nu-
clei for the very diﬀerent entrance channels 16O+204Pb,
40Ar+180Hf, 82Se+138Ba, and 96Zr+124Sn, respectively.
Analogously, in panels a), b), c), and d) of Fig. 5 are re-
ported the results of Γﬁs/Γtot excitation functions repre-
senting the ﬁssion probabilities from the 220Th∗, 219Th∗,
218Th∗, 217Th∗, and 216Th∗ excited nuclei for the above-
mentioned reactions.

Similar considerations can be made by observing the
values of neutron emission probabilities Γn/Γtot reported
in Fig. 4 and the corresponding values of the ﬁssion prob-
abilities Γﬁs/Γtot reported in Fig. 5, at any ﬁxed excita-
CN when the 220Th CN is formed
tion energy value of E∗
by the four very diﬀerent reactions in the entrance chan-
nel. Since the eﬀective ﬁssion barrier < Bﬁs > values
are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for the excited nuclei 220Th∗,
219Th∗, .... 216Th∗ along the deexcitation cascade at any
ﬁxed excitation energy value of the formed 220Th CN,
also the competition between the value of the neutron
emission probability Γn/Γtot and the one of the corre-
sponding ﬁssion probability Γﬁs/Γtot is diﬀerent for any
studied excited nucleus reached along the deexcitation
cascade. This assertion and the related diﬀerences can be
easily veriﬁed by comparing the Γn/Γtot values in Fig. 4
(and the Γﬁs/Γtot values in Fig. 5) obtained at any E∗
CN
value (see for example at 35.5, 46, and 61 MeV) when the
same 220Th CN and other intermediate excited nuclei are
formed by the four diﬀerent considered reactions in the
entrance channel.

As discussion about results concerning < Bﬁs >,
Γn/Γtot and Γﬁs/Γtot represented in Figs. 3, 4, and 5,
respectively, we give the following details. The trends
of the lines < Bﬁs > given in Fig. 3 for the four con-
sidered reactions represented in panels (a), (b), (c) and
(d), respectively, are consistent with each other taking
into account that for the two very asymmetric reactions
(panels (a) and (b)) the fusion process is dominant in
comparison with the quasiﬁssion one due to low values of
the intrinsic fusion barrier B∗
fus [3], especially at high val-
ues of angular momentum (cid:96) during the evolution of DNS.

Instead, for the two almost symmetric reactions (panels
(c) and (d) of ﬁgure 3) the quasiﬁssion process is domi-
nant in comparison with the fusion one due to low value
of quasiﬁssion barrier Bqf [3], especially at high values of
(cid:96). But, at the deexcitation of CN the ﬁssion process is
dominant for asymmetric reactions (panels (a) and (b))
in comparison with the evaporation process of light par-
ticles (n, p, and α) especially at high E∗
CN values where
< Bﬁs > strongly decreases. Diﬀerently, for the symmet-
ric reactions (panels (c) and (d) of ﬁgure 3) a large part of
high momentum values contributes to quasiﬁssion during
the DNS stage determining the CN formation character-
ized by a reduced range of angular momentum (cid:96). In these
cases represented in panels (c) and (d), the < Bﬁs > val-
ues slowly decrease with the increase of the excitation
energy E∗
CN since the damping function on the shell cor-
rection by formula (10)-produces a smaller fade-out of the
ﬁssion barrier Bﬁs in comparison with the cases of pan-
els a) and b) representing the asymmetric reactions, for
any excitation energy E∗
CN. Consequently to the results
presented in Fig. (3) and the above comments, for the
asymmetric reactions the ﬁssion probability Γﬁs/Γtot of
220Th CN versus E∗
CN in average increases (see solid lines
in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 5) and obviously the neutron
emission probability Γn/Γtot of excited 220Th CN in av-
erage decreases versus E∗
CN (see solid lines in panels (a)
and (b) of Fig. 4). Instead, for the symmetric reactions
represented in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 4, at a weak
increase of the neutron emission probability Γn/Γtot ver-
sus E∗
CN corresponds a decrease of the ﬁssion probability
Γﬁs/Γtot versus E∗
CN (see solid lines in panels (c) and (d)
of Fig. 5).

Moreover, in order to verify the eﬀects that are induced
on the types of evaporation residue nuclei formed along
the deexcitation cascade of the same 220Th CN (reached
with the same value of excitation energy E∗
CN by a very
diﬀerent mass asymmetric reactions in the entrance chan-
nel) we also calculated the ER yields obtained by the
intermediate excited nuclei (with Z < 90) after charged
particle emissions (proton and α) together with neutron
emission, and the ER yields obtained by the excited nu-
clei after neutron emission only (with Z = 90). For this
purpose, we present in table II the ratio between the
ER production from excited nuclei with Z < 90 and the
ER production from excited nuclei with Z = 90, when
the 220Th CN is formed at excitation energies of 35.5,
46, and 61 MeV by the very diﬀerent reactions in the
entrance channel: 16O+204Pb, 40Ar+180Hf, 82Se+138Ba,
96Zr+124Sn.

By considering the obtained results of the ratio
ER(Z < 90)/ER(Z = 90) it is possible to conclude that:

i) the contribution of the ER formation after charged
and neutral particle emission with Z < 90 is many
times higher than ER formation after neutron emis-
sion only, at any excitation energy E∗
CN of the com-
pound nucleus formation, and for any type of reac-
tion in the entrance channel;

ii) the rate of the ER formation after charged particle
emission generally increases with the increase of the
excitation energy value of E∗

CN;

iii) at any excitation energy value of E∗

CN, the ratio
ER(Z < 90)/ER(Z = 90) is strongly sensitive to
the entrance channel reaction starting from the ﬁrst
nuclear contact of reactants (forming the DNS) up
to the complete evolution of the reaction mecha-
nism that is speciﬁc for each reaction, and that ra-
tio changes for the same considered reaction with
the excitation energy value of E∗

CN.

Therefore, the results presented in table II and the
consequent related analysis of reactions leading to the
same 220Th CN allow one to conclude that the rates of
the reaction products (quasiﬁssion, fusion-ﬁssion, fast ﬁs-
sion, and the types of evaporation residues formed after
neutron and charged particles emissions) are strongly de-
pendent on the reaction in the entrance channel and on
the excitation energy E∗
CN. Moreover, the deexcitation
cascade of the same CN formed with the same excitation
energy value E∗
CN is strongly sensitive to the reaction
in the entrance channel to cause of the diﬀerent angular
momentum distribution σ(cid:96)
fus versus (cid:96) at formation of CN.
The presented methodology and results on the excita-
tion functions of evaporation residues formed after neu-
tron and charged particles emissions can be useful to ex-
perimentalists in order to observe and measure with a
better eﬃcient rate the ﬁnal products of heavy nuclei
reactions leading to formation of superheavy compound
nuclei. Since along the deexcitation cascade of super-
heavy CN it is possible for excited nuclei to evaporate
charged particles (α and proton) together with neutrons,
and the formation of evaporation residues (ERs) after
charged particle emission too is much larger in compari-
son with the ERs formation after neutron emission only
(see Fig. 6), it is necessary in experiments to arrange fa-
cilities and methods useful to detect evaporation residues
with ZER < ZCN within an interval of residue nuclei
with atomic number Zi ranging between Zi=ZCN − 8 and
Zi=ZCN. The eﬃciency of detecting evaporation residues
of superheavy nuclei and the possibility of determining
the related cross sections are more favorable than those
currently used for the identiﬁcation of ERs after neutron
emission only from the CN.

As an example we present in ﬁgure 6 the comparison

between the σER cross sections versus E∗

the 48Ca+249Cf reaction leading to the 297118 CN when
the charged particles are also considered in the evapora-
tion (full line) and when the neutron emission only are
considered (dashed line) along the deexcitation cascade
of the compound nucleus. As one can see, the cross sec-
tion obtained by including the emission of charged par-
ticles overcomes the one obtained via neutron emission
only by more than one order of magnitude. The evap-
oration residue calculated for neutron emission and the
comparison with experimental data was reported in our
previous work [6]. The theoretical group [20] suggests
the opportunity to use the charged emission channels for
the synthesis of superheavy elements by making quanti-
tative calculation, while others [21] aﬃrm charged emis-
sion contribution to ERs being negligible in this kind of
reaction. Therefore, accurate experimental investigation
on the identiﬁcation of the evaporation residue produced
also by the emission of charged particles can give pre-
cious information to theoretical groups to improve the
prediction power of their models.

V. CONCLUSION

The present investigation on heavy ion reactions with
various mass (charge) asymmetry parameters points out
the eﬀects of the entrance channel on the CN formation
and the consequent diﬀerent ways of its deexcitation cas-
cade even when the formed CN is characterized by the
same Z and A values and has the same excitation energy
E∗
CN. The reason of this diﬀerent way of deexcitation of
CN is due to the diﬀerent orbital angular momentum dis-
tribution of reactants in the entrance channel to cause of:
diﬀerent mass (charge) asymmetry parameter of reacting
nuclei, the speciﬁc shapes (oblate, prolate or spherical),
and also the eventual deformation parameters of these
beam and target nuclei, even when the CN is formed
with the same Z, A and E∗
CN values. Moreover, the eﬀec-

tive ﬁssion barrier < Bﬁs > of each intermediate excited
nucleus reached at each step of the deexcitation cascade
of the same formed CN with the same E∗
CN but by vari-
ous entrance channels, is aﬀected by the various angular
momentum distributions for the four considered reactions
forming the 220Th CN; in addition, the damping function
of the ﬁssion barrier Bﬁs determines diﬀerent eﬀects on
the deexcitation of CN to cause of the diﬀerent ranges
of angular momentum (cid:96) covered by the considered reac-
tions. Therefore, the competition between Γn/Γtot and
Γﬁs/Γtot for each considered intermediate excited nucleus
reached along the deexcitation cascade of CN is aﬀected
by the type of reaction in the entrance channel and the
excitation energy E∗
CN too. Furthermore, we can antic-
ipate the information that at each E∗
CN value the for-
mation of evaporation residue nuclei ERs –formed after
neutrons emission only along the deexcitation cascade of
CN and the ones formed by the charged emission too–
is strongly sensitive to the type of reaction in the en-
trance channel and to the complete reaction mechanism
also when it leads to the same CN for A, Z and E∗
values.

CN

Therefore, by considering also the emission of charged
particles proton and α together with neutron emission
along the deexcitation cascade of the 220Th CN the re-
sults of calculation show that the total ER evaporation
residue nuclei cross sections contributed by the interme-
diate excited nuclei after charged particle emission too
(with Z <90) along the complete deexcitation cascade

of CN are greater than the ER yields obtained by the
excited nuclei after neutron emission only (with Z =90).
This additional result on the evaporation residue produc-
tion further conﬁrms that the deexcitation of the same
CN with the same excitation energy E∗
CN formed by var-
ious reactions with diﬀerent mass (charge) asymmetry
parameter is strongly sensitive to the eﬀects of the en-
trance channel and also to the complete reaction mecha-
nism that is speciﬁc for each reaction.

We have shown that the consistent description of the
fade-out of the shell correction to the ﬁssion barrier with
increasing temperature and angular momentum is very
important for reliable estimation of the ﬁnal reaction
products. This result is of crucial importance for the
synthesis of superheavy elements, since it extends the
stabilizing eﬀects of the shell structure to higher temper-
ature, but this stabilizing eﬀects, however, will be partial
removed by the decrease of the shell correction with the
increase of angular momentum. Moreover, the present
result related to the determination of ERs nuclei forma-
tion after charged particle emission of CN indicating total
evaporation residue cross sections much higher than the
ER cross section after neutron emission only (see Fig.
6), suggest researchers in experiment of developing ap-
propriate procedures useful for the identiﬁcation of ER
nuclei with Z < ZCN.
