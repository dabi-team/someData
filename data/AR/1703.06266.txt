Abstract We have performed numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of two closed
active regions (AR). The input magnetic ﬁeld values were the coronal magnetic ﬁeld computed
as extrapolation coronal from observations of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld. The studied active
regions, NOAA AR12565 and AR12567, were registered as diﬀerent bipolar region. Our investigation,
the 3D coronal extrapolations, as well as the numerical MHD experiments, revealed that actually
they evolved together as a quadrupolar active region. The second region emerged later under the
loops system of AR12565 and separated from this one. A natural current sheet formed between then
and it plays an important role in the explosive events (ﬂares and coronal mass ejections) occurrence.

Keywords: Solar physics, numerical simulations, active regions, magnetogram, solar observations.

1 Introduction

The active regions (ARs) represent major features of the solar activity. They are the typical manifestation
of the bipolar or more complex magnetic ﬁeld emerging from the convective zone. An active region is itself
a complex entity involving diﬀerent levels of the solar atmosphere, from the sub-photosphere to the corona.
Bumba and Howard [2] have provided an observational perspective of an active region development. They
have highlighted the importance of the supergranular pattern in the formation of the sunspot groups, the
base of the active regions.

Modeling such phenomena presume the development of non-linear processes and a multitude of
developing scenarios, that’s why the use of numerical simulations are the most common approaches.
Numerical MHD simulations, studying the formation and development of the active regions, approaches
the rise of toroidal ﬂux tubes from the bottom of the convection zone based on the thin ﬂux tube
approximation. There are simulations (it e.g. [3,4,5,6]) able to reproduce global properties of ARs such as
their tilt angles, latitude of apparition, asymmetries between the leading and following polarities. There
are many other modern simulations and we mention the work of [7], that emphasis the results from the
interaction of the rising magnetic ﬁeld with the turbulent convective ﬂow during the rising process. Fan
and Gibson [8] performed a 3D numerical simulation of a low-β coronal magnetic ﬁeld modeled as an
arcade, where a twisted ﬂux tube emerge into. They have found that the ﬂux tube became kink-instable
when it attainted a big enough twist. A current sheet with S-shape formed between the coronal and the
emerging magnetic ﬁeld. Recently, [9] performed a MHD simulation of a nearly realistic simulation of a
solar eruption from origin to onset, using observational data-driven model and a potential-ﬁeld-source
surface model for the coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation. Inoue [10] summarized the current progress
for the MHD simulations using the observed magnetic ﬁeld, by approaching both steps.

Our aim was to study the development of an active region starting from real magnetogram data as
initial input for the magnetic ﬁeld, and not with analytical expression as classical used. Our goal is to
emphasize the evolution of an active region, starting with the magnetic ﬁeld data registered at a certain
moment by HMI/SDO instrument, and to compare the obtained scenarios to the observed events. A ﬁrst
attempt for such numerical MHD experiments was performed by [11]. This goal implied two stages of the
work: (I) the extrapolation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld from the observed photospheric one, based on
nonlinear force-free ﬁeld approximation, and (II) the use of this magnetic ﬁeld components as initial input
for the MHD numerical simulations. We have applied a nonlinear force-free ﬁeld method to extrapolate
the magnetic ﬁeld, method transcribed in an IDL program by [12], to obtain the components of the
magnetic ﬁeld Bx, By, Bz. Two of them, Bx, Bz became the initial magnetic ﬁeld values for a 2D MHD

and later intensively used by T.Forbes [14], and C.Dumitrache [15].

The present work intends to study an interesting complex of two bipolar neighbor active regions that
developed together. We have chosen the AR12565 and AR12567 that were observed on the Sun between
12 and 24 July 2016. The bipolar AR12565 raised the ﬁrst on the visible side of the Sun, on 12 July 2016,
and it was followed by AR12567, forming together a quadrupolar active region on 16 July 2016. They
developed as a unique quadrupolar active region for few days. Both active regions were very productive
in ﬂares and more mass ejecta. We have observed these two regions in white light and Halpha wavelength
at Bucharest Solar Station of the Astronomical Institute of Romanian Academy, where three solar ﬂares
were registered: on 18 July - a two ribbon ﬂare, while on 21 and 22 July - compact ﬂares [16].

2 Description of the method

The computational method implies two main steps: (I) the preparation of the data by performing 3D
extrapolation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines and so getting the values of the magnetic ﬁeld components
Bx, By, Bz at that time moment, and (II) the MHD numerical simulations in the coronal conditions,
using a 2D code and the Bx, Bz components.

(I) We have used the magnetograms measured by the HMI instrument onboard of the SDO spacecraft.
First, the active regions zone was selected and cut oﬀ from the magnetogram in order to be analysed. Fig.
1 displays the magnetogram and the active regions zones, where the little red crosses indicate the ten
dipoles positions used in the extrapolation computation at that moment.

Figure 1. The full-disk HMI/SDO magnetogram and the active region zone cutting up.

The positions of the ﬁve pairs of magnetic dipoles were detected in Cartesian coordinates from the
magnetogram, by choosing the local extrema for each polarity by Powell method. Finding the locations
of the dipoles from the magnetogram involves two steps: ﬁnding the XY coordinates of the major or
dominate dipoles and than ﬁnding the z coordinates.

The IDL code [12] considers the active region as a magnetic dipole deﬁned by

By = B0 ·

Bz = −B0

3xz

where r = px2 + y2 + z2 and B0 scales the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. We have modiﬁed this code
to be adapted to our needs. The numerical resulted components of the magnetic ﬁeld were used to the
next step (II).

(II) The second step was performed using a two dimensions Fortran code for the integration of the
MHD equations. The Alfven code was described by [13] and extensively used by T.Forbes, and later by
C.Dumitrache ([14], [15]). This code is based on SHASTA (SHarp and Smooth Transport Algorithm)
method that was developed by Boris and Book [17], [18]. It is a ﬂux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm
type that was constructed to solve the radiative, diﬀusive MHD equations by a predictor-corrector
numerical scheme of integration. SHASTA uses high-diﬀusion monotone ﬁrst-order schemes and low-
diﬀusion second-order ones. We point out that the Alfven code computations published in the past were
performed on a mesh 49 x 97. For big mesh, the code becomes instable. After a long experience of
working with this code, we considered recently a mesh of 100 x 100, taking care for the numerical step of
integration.

In the present paper, we have performed both steps of calculations for more magnetograms, registered
at diﬀerent time moments, for β = 0.1 and one solar radius. The run of the program for a certain
magnetogram was stopped when a stable state is attainted and the topology of the magnetic ﬁeld, velocity
ﬁeld and plasma density rest unchanged. Usually, we have obtained development of a conﬁguration for few
seconds. The use of a 2D code is enough for our purpose, for the moment. The results of the simulations
are only indicative for the plasma and magnetic ﬁeld behaviour, but gave unrealistic values for the plasma
parameters.

3 The results

Our simulations were focused on the period when both region are visible on the Sun, it i.e. between 16
and 22 July. We have analyzed and started with the magnetograms registered on the following dates
and times format yyyymmdd_hhmmss. Each ﬁgure displays the results of the 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld
extrapolations at a time moment, magnetic ﬁeld (Bx and Bz components) that is the starting point for
the simulations. The main stages of the numerical results are plotted too, where the elapsed time in
seconds is noted at the up left corner of each cartoon.

The cartoons with the results plot the dimensionless quantities: the magnetic ﬁeld lines, the velocity
ﬁeld and the plasma density (ﬁled plots), on a grid of 200 × 100, ie the symmetry axis is at the 10 division
on the graphic abscise. In the plots, the Ox axis from the simulations code, along that the gravity acts,
becomes Oz, it i.e. vertical one. Each ﬁgure displays the bar code of the colors used for the density for the
ﬁlled contours. The bar code labels represent the values of the dimensionless density (ρ), the dimension
coronal densities being ρ‘ = ρ · 109 part./ cm−3.

The ﬁrst magnetogram contents the AR12565 ﬁeld lines, but the AR12567 emerged during 16 July
2016. Next days, during their evolution, these two active regions acted either as one or as two entities.
They produced many ﬂares and suﬀered many magnetic reconnections. The open magnetic ﬁeld lines in
the ﬁgures are marking of eruptive events. Fig. 2 and 3 display the evolution of the complex composed by
NOAA AR12565 and AR12567 during the day when the second active region appeared very closed to
AR12565. As ﬁg. 2 indicates, the ﬁrst cartoon catches the ﬂux emergence. The open magnetic ﬁeld lines
indicates the place of emergence and they are bought together as in a single root. The simulations (2)

show the plasmoids emergence from an unique root, with the development of plasma ﬂows in divergent
directions. Two loop systems formed later, starting with the third cartoon in the ﬁgures. At the end of
the simulation we remark a ﬂare resulted from all the magnetic reconnections in zone. To note that a
ﬂare can be also seen on the AIA/SDO coronal observations in the 131Å wavelength (please see [19]).
In ﬁg. 3, we see in the 3D extrapolations the completed apparition of the second active region and the
well deﬁned loop systems of both regions, with also loops underlying both of them. The simulations also
indicate the separation of a bipolar active region in two parts, but with plasma emergence in the current
sheet appeared between the two loop systems. Interesting fact is that downward ﬂows can be view in the
ﬁrst stage of evolution, ﬂows that probably pushed and separated the active regions, before the loops
form. After that, upward ﬂows indicate continuum ﬂux emergence.

contours) and velocity ﬁelds. The colour bar quantiﬁes the dimensionless density.

On 17 July the two loop systems representing the two active regions are well deﬁned, with other loops
underlying them in a unique quadrupolar system. In the region between them plasma insulated as the
active regions push these plasmoids upward. A small coronal mass ejection (CME) can be observed in
the middle region ([20]). At that moment the active regions crossed the central meridian, but no other
signiﬁcative CME’s source could be observed in the second dial on the solar disk [21].

On 18 July (ﬁg. 5), both regions are separated and AR12565 displays open magnetic ﬁeld lines in the
3D extrapolation. This magnetic conﬁguration usually indicates an explosive event that has produced
or it follows to produce. The simulations show a continuum plasma and magnetic ﬁeld emergence in

contours) and velocity ﬁelds. The colour bar quantiﬁes the dimensionless density.

zone between both active regions, and a two ribbon ﬂare occurrence. The solar Halpha observations ([16])
testify this scenario: a two ribbon ﬂare was observed as starting between AR12565 and AR12567 (at
07:54 UT), but extending at both active regions. The simulations for 19 July (ﬁg. 6) repeated the same
scenario. Observationally, few sub-ﬂares and one more important ﬂare were registered [22].

On 20 July (ﬁg. 7), AR12565 and AR12567 behave as two separate bipolar regions. Four sub-ﬂares
appeared ([22]) and the numerical simulations indicate more features resembling with bright points. On
21 July (ﬁg. 8) the active regions are linked again, but both of them display open magnetic ﬁeld lines and
indicate so explosive events to watch. The simulations revealed a ﬂare followed by a CME. Observationally,
more explosive events happen, one of them being observed also at Bucharest Observatory in Halpha line
([16]).

Fig. 9 displays the results for 22 July, when AR12567 is more pronounced and AR12565 seems to be
in the decaying phase, but with an open magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The simulations revealed explosive
events again and a mass ejecta. More ﬂare were registered ([22]) including one observed at Bucharest
([16]) starting with 06:38 UT. These simulations show again that both regions acted as single one since
the main ejecta left the middle zone.

4 Discussions

Far to be accomplished the goal of obtaining realistic values for the plasma parameters, as well as the
aim of having MHD tool for explosive events forecast for the space weather purpose, we have performed
a series of numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) experiments starting with real magnetograms as
input data for the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. These work involved two stages: the 3D coronal magnetic
ﬁeld extrapolation from HMI/SDO magnetograms and the integration of the MHD equations, by setting
the bottom boundary of the model at the coronal base. The numerical scheme of the Fortran (Alfven)
code used is based on a Flux-Corrected Transport algorithm (SHASTA method) and was applied in a
Cartesian frame. The results are interesting for the magnetic topology results, the velocity ﬁeld and
plasma density distribution, they giving a view of the scenarios of evolution for the studied active regions.
The comparison of these results to the observational data regarding the active regions AR12565 and
AR12567 gave us a conﬁrmation of the method, though the MHD numerical code used in this work is
only 2D one.

The complex formed by AR12565 and AR12567 acted many time as a quadrupolar unique region.
The 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolations revealed that AR12567 appeared by ﬂux emergence too
close to AR12565, or even separated from this one from one of its side. In this way, their evolution can
not be a surprise, many ﬂares occurring in the middle zone between the two active regions. So, the main
conclusion of this paper is that we actually have a single one region with development in more stages: a
period being a bipolar region and later becoming a quadrupolar one. The numerical simulations results
shown a continuous plasma and magnetic ﬂux emergence during the AR evolution. These processes led to
a myriad of each day ﬂares and a few of small CMEs or mass ejecta.
