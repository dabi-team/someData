We explore the system size dependence of heavy-quark-QGP interaction by studying the heavy
ﬂavor meson suppression and elliptic ﬂow in Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, Ar-Ar and O-O collisions at the LHC.
The space-time evolution of the QGP is simulated using a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic
model, while the heavy-quark-QGP interaction is described by an improved Langevin approach that
includes both collisional and radiative energy loss inside a thermal medium. Within this framework,
we provides a reasonable description of the D meson suppression and ﬂow coeﬃcients in Pb-Pb
collisions, as well as predictions for both D and B meson observables in other collision systems yet
to be measured. We ﬁnd a clear hierarchy for the heavy meson suppression with respect to the
size of the colliding nuclei, while their elliptic ﬂow coeﬃcient relies on both the system size and
the geometric anisotropy of the QGP. Sizable suppression and ﬂow are predicted for both D and B
mesons in O-O collisions, which serve as a crucial bridge of jet quenching between large and small
collision systems. Scaling behaviors between diﬀerent collision systems are shown for heavy meson
suppression factor and the bulk-eccentricity-rescaled heavy meson elliptic ﬂow as functions of the
number of participant nucleons in heavy-ion collisions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that at
extremely high temperature and density, nuclear matter
transits from the hadron state to a color-deconﬁned state,
known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1]. This has
been supported by a large number of experimental evi-
dences from relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Rela-
tivistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) [2], among which anisotropic ﬂow and jet
quenching are considered as the two most important sig-
natures of the formation of QGP. At low transverse mo-
mentum (pT), hadrons emitted from the QGP exhibit
strong anisotropy in their azimuthal angular distribu-
tions [3–5], which has been successfully described by rela-
tivistic hydrodynamic models [6–10]. The small values of
the speciﬁc shear viscosity extracted from hydrodynamic
calculations [11, 12] clearly shows the strongly-coupled
nature of this ﬂuid-like QGP. At high pT, hadrons and
reconstructed jets emanating from initial hard scatter-
ings are signiﬁcantly quenched after traversing the QGP
medium [13–18]. The extracted large values of the jet
quenching parameter ˆq [19, 20] indicate the quark-gluon
degrees of freedom inside the dense nuclear matter.

Over the past few years, large anisotropic ﬂows have
been observed in small collision systems as well, such as
deuteron-gold (d-Au) collisions at RHIC and proton-lead

(p-Pb) collisions at the LHC [21–24]. Interestingly, these
ﬂow coeﬃcients can also be successfully described by hy-
drodynamic calculations, implying the possible formation
of mini-QGP in such small systems [25–33]. On the other
hand, the other strong evidence of QGP, jet quenching,
has not been observed so far. For instance, despite the
large elliptic ﬂow coeﬃcient (v2) of D mesons in p-Pb
collisions [34], their nuclear modiﬁcation factor (RpA) is
found to be consistent with unity [35]. This has trig-
gered hot debates on whether the collectivity observed
in small systems originates from ﬁnal-state QGP eﬀects
or from initial-state gluon saturation eﬀects [36–43]. One
possible way of disentangling the initial-state and ﬁnal-
state contributions to jet observables is to scan the jet
quenching eﬀect across various sizes of nuclear collision
systems [44, 45]. This would bridge the gap between large
and small systems and may hopefully help identify the
boundary across which QGP disappears. Along this di-
rection, several theoretical eﬀorts have been recently de-
voted to explore the nuclear modiﬁcation eﬀects on high
pT hadrons in systems smaller than Pb-Pb collisions at
the LHC energies [46–49], and how parton energy loss
depends on the size of collision systems [50, 51].

Among various energetic probes of medium properties,
heavy quarks are of particular interest [52, 53]. Due to
their large masses that suppress their thermal produc-
tion from the QGP, heavy quarks are mainly produced
via initial hard scatterings and then interact with the
medium with their ﬂavors conserved, which makes them
a clean probe to the evolution history of the expanding
QGP. Tremendous eﬀorts have been made towards under-
standing the dynamics of heavy quarks inside the QGP,

 
 
 
 
 
 
including their elastic scattering [54–56], inelastic scat-
tering [57–66] and hadronization [67–71] processes. For
detailed comparisons between diﬀerent model implemen-
tations, one may refer to Refs. [72–76].

In this work, we aim at using heavy quarks to probe
QGP with diﬀerent sizes. Our state-of-the-art Langevin-
hydrodynamics framework is applied to calculate the nu-
clear modiﬁcation factor (RAA) and the elliptic ﬂow co-
eﬃcient (v2) of heavy ﬂavor mesons across Pb-Pb, Xe-
Xe, Ar-Ar and O-O collisions. The (3+1)-dimensional
viscous hydrodynamic model CLVisc [77–80] is adopted
for simulating the realistic QGP proﬁles produced in
these collision systems, while the improved Langevin ap-
proach [81, 82] is used for describing both elastic and
inelastic scatterings of heavy quarks through the QGP
medium. Hadronization plays an important role in study-
ing heavy ﬂavor dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. In this
work, heavy quarks exiting the QGP are converted to
heavy ﬂavor hadrons using our advanced coalescence-
fragmentation model [71], which has successfully pre-
dicted the heavy ﬂavor hadron chemistry at RHIC and
the LHC. These sophisticated models on heavy quark
energy loss and hadronization are necessary for a more
quantitative comparison to the experimental measure-
ments. Within this framework, we predict both D and
B meson RAA and v2 for diﬀerent collision systems and
collision centralities, from which we investigate the hi-
erarchy of heavy quark energy loss and its momentum
anisotropy with respect to the medium size and geometric
anisotropy. In particular, the scaling behaviors of heavy
ﬂavor meson observables between diﬀerent collision sys-
tems are explored. We ﬁnd that both RAA and the bulk-
eccentricity-rescaled elliptic ﬂow (v2/ε2) of heavy ﬂavor
mesons scale with the number of participant nucleons
(Npart). These ﬁndings help to disentangle the eﬀects of
the overall intensity of medium modiﬁcation and its ge-
ometric asymmetry on jet quenching observables, which
can be tested by future measurements.
This paper is organized as follows.

ergy loss of heavy quarks inside QGP. In Sec. IV, our
numerical results on D and B meson RAA and v2 are
presented for diﬀerent centrality regions across Pb-Pb,
Xe-Xe, Ar-Ar and O-O collision systems, from which the
hierarchy and scaling behaviors of these observables with
respect to the system size, medium geometry and heavy
quark mass will be investigated in detail. The conclusion
of this study is presented in Sec. V.

density distribution S(τ0, x, y, ηs) is constructed by fold-
ing the smooth entropy density s(x, y) in the transverse
plane and the parametrized envelope function H(ηs) in

by the Trento initial condition [85], in which the posi-
tions of nucleons within nucleus are ﬁrst sampled using

spherical harmonic functions Ynl(θ). Here, β2, β4 and w

II. HYDRODYNAMIC SIMULATION OF
MEDIUM PROFILES

In this study, the dynamical evolution of the QGP
medium is provided by the (3+1)-dimensional CLVisc

where we use η0 = 2.23, σηs = 1.8 for Xe and η0 = 1.7,
σηs = 2.0 for other nuclei in this study. For each cen-
trality interval of each collision system, we average over
5000 Trento events to get a smooth initial entropy distri-
bution as our hydrodynamic input at the initial proper
time τ0 = 0.6 fm.

In the framework of

the CLVisc hydrodynamic
model
[78], the equation of motion for the energy-
momentum tensor T µν and the dissipative equation for
the shear stress tensor πµν are solved with the partial
chemical equilibrium equation of state s95p-pce in the
Milne coordinate using the Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) al-
gorithm:

where σµν is the symmetric shear tensor and θ is the ex-
pansion rate. We set the speciﬁc shear viscosity ηv/s =
0.16 and the relaxation time τπ = 3ηv/(T s). After hydro-
dynamic evolution, the QGP is converted to hadrons via
the Cooper-Frye formula with the switching temperature
set as Tsw = 137 MeV. With above setups, our hydro-
dynamic calculation provides reasonable descriptions of
the soft hadron spectra in Pb-Pb collisions and Xe-Xe
collisions. The QGP proﬁles of Ar-Ar and O-O collisions
should be viewed as predictions at this moment.

III. HEAVY QUARK EVOLUTION INSIDE QGP

The time evolution of heavy quarks through the QGP
medium is described using the modiﬁed Langevin equa-
tion [81] that simultaneously includes quasi-elastic scat-
tering and medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung pro-
cesses of heavy quarks inside a thermal medium:

In the above equation, the ﬁrst two terms on the right-
hand side follow the classical Langevin equation, denot-
ing the drag force and thermal random force experienced
by a heavy quark while it frequently scatters with the
constituents of a thermal medium. The thermal force ~ξ

In addition to the drag and diﬀusion from the mul-
tiple scattering process, the eﬀects of medium-induced
gluon radiation is introduced into Eq. (7) as a recoil force
~fg =
d~pg/dt exerted on heavy quarks while they emit
gluons with momentum ~pg. The probability of gluon ra-
diation during a time interval (t, t+∆t) is evaluated using
the average number of emitted gluons during this time

gluon transport coeﬃcient which can be related to the
quark diﬀusion coeﬃcient via ˆq = 2κCA/CF , where CA
and CF are color factors of gluon and quark respectively.
Note that in our modiﬁed Langevin model, there is only
one free parameter which we choose as the dimensionless
quantity Ds(2πT ).
It is adjusted as Ds(2πT ) = 4 [76]
to provide a reasonable description of the heavy ﬂavor
meson observables in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.
When we sample the energy-momentum of

the
medium-induced gluons according to Eq. (9), a lower cut-
oﬀ is implemented for the gluon energy at ω0 = x0E =
πT , below which gluon is not allowed to form. Due to the
lack of the gluon absorption process in the current imple-
mentation, this cut-oﬀ helps mimic the balance between
gluon emission and absorption processes around the ther-
mal energy scale. We have veriﬁed that an approximate,
though not exact, thermal equilibrium of heavy quarks
can be achieved after a suﬃciently long time of evolution
inside a thermal medium [81].

Using this Langevin framework, we can simulate the
heavy quark evolution through the QGP. The realis-
tic QGP medium is generated by the CLVisc hydrody-
namic model as described in Sec. II. Meanwhile, the
initial heavy quarks are sampled using the binary col-
lision vertices from the Monte-Carlo Glauber model for
their position space, and the ﬁxed-order-next-to-leading-
log (FONLL) calculation [90–92] convoluted with the
CT14NLO [93] parton distribution function for their mo-
mentum space. Then heavy quarks are placed into our
Langevin model for their subsequent interaction with the
QGP medium, which we assume to commence at the ini-
tial time (τ0 = 0.6 fm) of the hydrodynamic evolution.

After heavy quarks travel outside the QGP bound-
ary,
i.e., the local temperature of the medium drops
below Tc = 160 MeV, they are converted to heavy
ﬂavor hadrons via an advanced hybrid fragmentation-

probability between heavy quarks and thermal
light
quarks are calculated according to the wavefunction over-
lap between the free-quark state and hadronic bound
state. Both s and p-wave hadronic states are included
in our calculation, which naturally cover the majority of
heavy ﬂavor hadron states observed in the Particle Data
Group [94]. Based on this probability, heavy quarks that
do not hadronize through coalescence are fragmented into

heavy ﬂavor hadrons via Pythia [95] simulation. The
heavy ﬂavor hadrons produced from both coalescence and
fragmentation processes are then utilized for analyzing
the ﬁnal-state observables.

As discussed earlier, a constant Ds(2πT ) = 4 is used
in this work since our main focus is on the system size
dependence of heavy quark energy loss and heavy ﬂa-
vor suppression and ﬂow at the LHC. One may refer
to our previous study [76] for a detailed analysis of the
systematic uncertainties introduced by various model in-
gredients, such as the initial heavy quark spectrum, the
starting time of heavy-quark-medium interaction, the
medium proﬁle in the pre-equilibrium state, and the tem-
perature dependence of the heavy quark diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient, etc. Compared to the linear Boltzmann trans-
port model used in our earlier work [51], the Langevin
approach is expected to be applicable to quasi-particles
with large masses inside a thermal medium. However,
it is easier to include the non-perturbative interaction
between low energy heavy quarks and the QGP in the
Langevin approach than in the perturbative-based Boltz-
mann calculation. Note that both models use the same
method to implement the radiative energy loss of heavy
quarks [51, 76].

IV. HEAVY FLAVOR MESON SUPPRESSION
AND FLOW

In this section, we present numerical results on the
nuclear modiﬁcations of D and B mesons, and compare
them between diﬀerent collision systems (Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe,
Ar-Ar and O-O) at the LHC energies. The two most fre-
quently quoted heavy ﬂavor observables – nuclear mod-
iﬁcation factor (RAA) and elliptic ﬂow coeﬃcient (v2) –
are utilized to quantify features of heavy quark energy
loss inside the QGP. In the present study, they are ex-
tracted as follows from the ﬁnal-state energy-momentum
information of the heavy ﬂavor mesons:

where Ncoll denotes the average number of binary colli-
sions in a given centrality bin of a given nucleus-nucleus
collision system, and
represents the average over
the ﬁnal-state heavy ﬂavor mesons generated in our sim-
ulations. Smooth hydrodynamic proﬁles are used in this
work, in which the x-z axes deﬁne the event plane while
the x-y axes deﬁne the transverse plane of nuclear col-
lisions. Within this setup, the azimuthal angle φ in
Eq. (11) is measured with respect to the +x direction.
Note that each smooth hydrodynamic proﬁle is generated
from an initial entropy distribution that has been aver-
aged over 5000 Trento events, whose participant planes
have been individually rotated to the x-z plane of our

computational frame. Therefore, such smooth hydrody-
namic proﬁle has captured key features of event-by-event
ﬂuctuations in the initial state and serve as a good ap-
proximation of direct event-by-event simulations of QGP
for studying heavy ﬂavor observables. Implementing full
event-by-event calculations can lead to stronger energy
loss of heavy quarks [96] and larger v2 [97] than using the
smooth proﬁles, though such diﬀerence is expected to be
within 10%. In this work, we use the event plane method
Eq. (11) to evaluate the heavy meson v2, following the
ALICE [98] and STAR [99] collaborations. Note that the
correlation method has also been applied in STAR [99]
and CMS [100] measurements. As shown by Ref. [99],
these two methods produce similar v2 for heavy mesons.
With these setups, we ﬁrst present in Fig. 1 the RAA
and v2 of D and B mesons in diﬀerent centrality classes
of Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.02 TeV. In the upper
panels, eﬀects of the nuclear shadowing eﬀects on the D
meson observables are shown. The shaded bands show
the diﬀerence between whether or not this nuclear shad-
owing eﬀect has been included in our calculation. Af-
ter including the EPPS16 [101] parametrization at the
next-to-leading-order, one may observe (in the upper left
panel) a suppression of the D meson RAA at low pT,
while an enhancement (anti-shadowing) at high pT. On
the other hand, this shadowing eﬀect has little impact on
the D meson v2, as illustrated in the upper right panel.
Note that the impact parameter averaged nuclear shad-
owing parametrization is used in Fig. 1. The dependence
of nuclear shadowing on the impact parameter could in-
troduce additional dependence of nuclear modiﬁcation
on centrality. This will be included in our future study.
Since the EPPS16 parametrization does not cover all nu-
cleus species that we investigate in the present work, we

choose to exclude this cold nuclear matter eﬀect for the
rest of our calculation in order to conduct an unbiased
comparison between diﬀerent collision systems. With the
heavy quark diﬀusion coeﬃcient set as D(2πT ) = 4, our
results on the D meson RAA and v2 for Pb-Pb collisions
are consistent with the data from ALICE and CMS col-
laborations [98, 100, 102]. This helps conﬁrm the sat-
isfactory path-length dependence of parton energy loss
embedded in our transport model.

Comparing diﬀerent centrality classes in each panel of
Fig. 1, one can observe a clear hierarchy in the heavy
meson RAA, i.e., larger heavy quark energy loss in more
central collisions leads to a smaller nuclear modiﬁcation
factor. However, this hierarchy does not hold for the
heavy meson v2 which depends on the competing eﬀects
between the amount of energy loss and the geometric
anisotropy of the medium. The former is stronger in
more central collisions, while the latter is larger in more
peripheral collisions. Therefore, one usually observes a
maximum for elliptic ﬂow v2 in semi-central/peripheral
collisions (e.g. 30-40%). Comparing upper panels and
lower panels, one can observe that D mesons have smaller
RAA and larger v2 than B mesons because charm quarks
have much smaller mass than bottom quarks.

Within the same framework, we investigate the nuclear
modiﬁcation of heavy ﬂavor mesons in smaller systems at
the LHC. Results are presented in Fig. 2 for Xe-Xe colli-
sions at √sNN = 5.44 TeV, in Fig. 3 for Ar-Ar collisions
at √sNN = 5.85 TeV, and in Fig. 4 for O-O collisions at
√sNN = 6.5 TeV, in spite of the current absence of the
corresponding experimental data. Similar to previous re-
sults for Pb-Pb collisions, in each ﬁgure, we present cal-
culations for D mesons in the upper panels and B mesons
in the lower panels, left for RAA and right for v2. In each

Comparing diﬀerent collision systems (from Fig. 1 to
Fig. 4), a general conclusion can be drawn, i.e., parton
energy loss becomes weaker inside a smaller collision sys-
tem, as suggested by the gradually larger heavy ﬂavor
meson RAA and smaller v2 within the same centrality
class as we move from Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, Ar-Ar to O-O col-
lisions. Such system size dependence of jet quenching
eﬀects provides a crucial bridge of jet-medium interac-

tion between large and small collision systems.

It is interesting to note that even in the relatively small
system produced by O-O collisions, considerable amount
of energy loss eﬀects are found for both charm and bot-
tom quarks in the most central collisions – the corre-
sponding D and B meson RAA’s are signiﬁcantly smaller
than unity while their v2’s have sizable values. As one
moves from central to peripheral collisions, heavy ﬂavor
meson RAA increases and approaches unity at high pT in
peripheral collisions. The rise-and-fall structure of RAA
at low pT region is due to the coalescence mechanism in
heavy hadron formation in the presence of QGP medium,
which converts low pT heavy quarks into intermediate pT
heavy ﬂavor mesons. For the heavy ﬂavor meson v2, it
ﬁrst increases and then decreases as a function of cen-
trality class due to the competing eﬀects between parton
energy loss and geometric anisotropy of the collision zone.
To have a more quantitative understanding of how
heavy quark energy loss depends on the system size of
QGP, we present the participant number (Npart) depen-
dence of the RAA and v2 of D mesons in Fig. 5 and B
In each panel of these two ﬁgures,

we present the pT-integrated observable as a function of
Npart for diﬀerent collision systems. The upper panels are
for 5 < pT < 8 GeV and the lower for 8 < pT < 16 GeV.
In the left panels, we observe a stronger nuclear modiﬁca-
tion of heavy mesons with a larger Npart. As previously
discussed, one can ﬁnd clear nuclear modiﬁcation of both
D and B mesons even in the small-size O-O collisions as
long as Npart is not small.
In addition, a scaling be-
havior of the nuclear modiﬁcation factor with respect to
Npart can be seen in the left panels: the heavy ﬂavor me-
son RAA in diﬀerent collision systems follow the similar
Npart dependence. In other words, heavy ﬂavor mesons

produced from diﬀerent collision systems share a similar
RAA as long as Npart is ﬁxed. The slight breaking of
this Npart scaling behavior shown in the ﬁgures could be
due to diﬀerent initial heavy quark spectra produced at
diﬀerent √sNN for diﬀerent collision systems.

Unlike RAA, the Npart scaling behavior does not exist
for v2, as shown in the right panels of Figs. 5 and 6. This
is because v2 is driven not only by the overall energy
loss of heavy quarks that is determined by Npart, but
also by the geometric anisotropy of the medium. For the
same centrality class, larger collision system (e.g. Pb-
Pb) has higher Npart than smaller system (e.g. O-O). In
other words, for similar Npart, larger system has stronger
anisotropy. Therefore, one observes the hierarchy of Pb-
Pb > Xe-Xe > Ar-Ar > O-O for the heavy meson v2 in
the right panels of these two ﬁgures.

To investigate how the heavy ﬂavor observables rely on
the geometry of the QGP, we present RAA and v2 as func-
tions of centrality in Figs. 7 and 8 for D and B mesons
respectively. Similar to the Npart dependence ﬁgures pre-
sented above, we show in each ﬁgure the pT-integrated
observables within 5 < pT < 8 GeV in the upper panel
and 8 < pT < 16 GeV in the lower panel. The left panels
are for RAA and the right for v2. For a given collision
system, we generally observe that the heavy ﬂavor meson
RAA increases from central co peripheral collisions due to
smaller heavy quark energy loss in more peripheral col-
lisions, while v2 ﬁrst increases and then decreases due
to the competing eﬀects between parton energy loss and
medium geometry. The only exception here is the large D
meson v2 in central O-O collisions. This could be caused
by the larger initial state ﬂuctuations in smaller O nuclei,
which generates large average eccentricity for the QGP
ﬁreballs produced in central O-O collisions.

FIG. 8. (Color online) Centrality dependence of RAA (left)
and v2 (right) of B mesons in diﬀerent collision systems, upper
for 5 < pT < 8 GeV and lower for 8 < pT < 16 GeV.

Comparing diﬀerent collision systems, one can clearly
observe the hierarchies of both RAA and v2 of heavy ﬂa-
vor mesons. As discussed earlier, for a given centrality
class (or medium eccentricity), a larger collision system
has a higher Npart, resulting in stronger energy loss of
heavy quarks through the medium. This yields Pb-Pb <
Xe-Xe < Ar-Ar < O-O for the heavy meson RAA, and
Pb-Pb > Xe-Xe > Ar-Ar > O-O for their v2. The ex-
ception of the D meson v2 in central O-O collisions is
again caused by larger ﬂuctuation eﬀects in smaller colli-
sions systems. Again, comparing Fig. 7 and 8, we notice
that D mesons have much smaller RAA and much larger

v2 than B mesons due to the mass dependence of charm
and bottom quark energy loss through the QGP.

Since the elliptic ﬂow coeﬃcient v2 of heavy ﬂavor
mesons depends on both the amount of heavy quark
energy loss and the medium anisotropy, its scaling be-
havior between diﬀerent collisions systems is hard to be
displayed when plotting as a function of either Npart or
centrality.
Interestingly, one may remove the medium
anisotropy eﬀect from the total contribution by rescaling
the heavy meson v2 with the bulk medium eccentricity
ε2. As shown in Fig. 9, the rescaled v2/ε2 is mainly de-
termined by the amount of parton energy loss, thus scales
with the system size or Npart between diﬀerent collision
systems. This behavior is very similar to heavy meson
RAA. Note that although the amount of heavy quark
energy loss is the main source of the heavy meson v2 af-
ter removing the bulk geometry eﬀect, the coupling of
heavy quark motion to the QGP ﬂow and the hadroniza-
tion process can also aﬀect the ﬁnal state heavy meson v2
and break the scaling behavior of v2/ε2 v.s. Npart. Such
breaking eﬀect is more prominent for low energy heavy
quarks and when the bulk radial ﬂow eﬀect is strong.

V. SUMMARY

Within our Langevin-hydrodynamics framework, we
have performed a systematic study on the system size
dependence of heavy quark energy loss in heavy-ion col-
lisions at the LHC energies. The space-time evolution of
the QGP produced in diﬀerent collision systems is simu-
lated using our (3+1)-dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamic
model. The medium modiﬁcation of the heavy quark
energy-momentum is described by our modiﬁed Langevin

equation that incorporates both elastic and inelastic scat-
terings of heavy quarks inside the QGP. By combining
this Langevin model with the FONLL calculation for
the initial heavy quark spectra and the fragmentation-
coalescence model for hadronization, we have calculated
the nuclear modiﬁcation factor (RAA) and elliptic ﬂow
coeﬃcient (v2) of D and B mesons in various centrality
regions of Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, Ar-Ar and O-O collisions at
the LHC. The transverse momentum, participant num-
ber and centrality dependences of the heavy meson RAA
and v2 have been investigated in detail.

Our results show a clear system size dependence of the
heavy meson RAA. For the same collision system, RAA
increases from central to peripheral collisions. For the
same centrality class, RAA increases (Pb-Pb < Xe-Xe <
Ar-Ar < O-O) as the size of colliding nuclei decreases.
We have demonstrated a clear scaling of the heavy me-
son RAA as a function of Npart between diﬀerent collision
systems, which indicates a direct correlation between the
amount of jet energy loss and the size of the QGP pro-
ﬁles. On the other hand, the heavy meson v2 simulta-
neously depends on the size and anisotropy of the QGP.
For the same collision system, v2 ﬁrst increases and then
decreases from central to peripheral collisions. For the
same centrality class, v2 generally increases as the size of
colliding nuclei increases, except for the relatively large
v2 in central O-O collisions due to the strong initial-state
ﬂuctuations of the small O nucleus. After eliminating
the eﬀects of diﬀerent bulk medium anisotropy in diﬀer-
ent collision systems, the bulk-eccentricity-rescaled heavy
meson elliptic ﬂow (v2/ε2) is found to scale with Npart.
This reveals a direct correlation between v2/ε2 and the
amount of heavy quark energy loss which depends on the
overall size of QGP. Moreover, the comparison between
D and B mesons demonstrates a clear mass dependence
of parton energy loss that yields smaller RAA and larger
v2 of D mesons than B mesons for the same collisions

system and the same centrality class.

The system size dependence of D and B meson ob-
servables discussed in this work provides a crucial bridge
between large (Pb-Pb) and small (p-Pb) systems of rel-
ativistic nuclear collisions. Comparison between our nu-
merical predictions here and future system-size-scan ex-
periments on jet quenching is expected to help resolve
several open questions in high-energy nuclear physics,
such as the precise path-length dependence and mass de-
pendence of parton energy loss, and the detailed corre-
lation of collective ﬂow coeﬃcients between hard probes

the small O-O collisions, as suggested by the quenching

mesons in central O-O collisions. This further implies

these even smaller collision systems. We note that our
earlier study [41] suggests that the strong elliptic ﬂow [34]
of D mesons in p-Pb collisions cannot be explained by
the ﬁnal state parton energy loss eﬀects.
In contrast,
Refs. [40, 103] show that the initial state gluon satura-
tion eﬀect can explain well the observed elliptic ﬂow of
heavy mesons in p-Pb collisions. Further investigations
on both heavy and light ﬂavor RAA and v2 in large and
small systems, and their scaling behaviors, may help to
identify the boundary where QGP disappears.
