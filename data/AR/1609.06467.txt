Probable projectile-target combinations for the synthesis of superheavy element 302120 have been 
studied taking Coulomb and proximity potential as the interaction barrier. The probabilities of compound 
nucleus  formation, PCN for the projectile-target combinations  found  in the cold reaction valley of  302120 
are estimated. At energies near and above the Coulomb barrier, we have calculated the capture, fusion and 
evaporation residue cross sections for the reactions of all the probable projectile-target combinations so as 
to predict the most promising projectile-target combinations for the synthesis of SHE 302120 in heavy ion 
fusion reactions. The calculated fusion and evaporation cross section for the more asymmetric (“hotter”) 
projectile-target  combination  is  found  to  be  higher  than  the  less  asymmetric  (“colder”)  combination.  It 
can  be  seen  from  the  nature  of  quasi-fission  barrier  height,  mass  asymmetry,  probability  of  compound 
nucleus  formation,  survival  probability  and  excitation  energy,  the  systems  44Ar  +  258No,  46Ar  +  256No, 
48Ca + 254Fm, 50Ca + 252Fm, 54Ti + 248Cf, 58Cr + 244Cm in the deep region I of cold reaction valley, and the 
systems  62Fe  +  240Pu,  64Fe  +  238Pu, 68Ni  +  234U,  70Ni  +  232U,  72Ni  +  230U,  74Zn  +  228Th  in  the  other cold 
valleys  are  identified  as  the  better  projectile-target  combinations  for  the  synthesis  of    302120.  Our 
prediction on the synthesis of   302120 superheavy nuclei using the combinations  54Cr+248Cm, 58Fe+244Pu, 
64Ni+238U  and  50Ti+249Cf    are  compared  with  available  experimental  data  and  other  theoretical

I. INTRODUCTION 

Heavy  ion  fusion  reactions  have  been  widely  used  to  synthesize  elements  in  the  heavy  and 
superheavy (SH) region and now nuclear reactions induced by heavy ions have become the principal tool 
in  nuclear  physics  research.  In  order to  form  heavy  nucleus,  relatively  heavier  projectile  must  be  fused 
with heavy target nuclei. This will lead to the formation of a highly excited completely fused system with 
a reduced probability of survival against fission. Up to now, considerable progress has been achieved in 
the  experimental  and  theoretical  investigations  in  the  region  of  SHE  [1-15].  Several  successful  [1] 
experiments  have  been  done  at  different  laboratories  for  the  production  of  SHE  with  Z≤118  and  an 
attempt  to  produce  Z=120  have  been  reported  [2].  To  extend  the  periodic  table,  two  different 
experimental approaches to synthesize SHE are used; the cold fusion reaction performed mainly at JINR-
FLNR,  Dubna  and  the  hot  fusion  reaction  performed  mainly  at  GSI,  Darmstadt,  and  at  RIKEN,  Japan. 
Using  cold  fusion  approach,  elements  with  Z=107-112  have  been  synthesized  [4-6]  and  hot  fusion 
reaction  led to the discoveries of elements with Z=113-118[7-11]. Several theoretical  calculations about 
the synthesis and decay of SHE have been performed within the fusion-by-diffusion (FBD) model[16-18], 
nuclear  collectivization  model  [19-20],  di-nuclear  system(DNS)  model  [21-26]  and  Coulomb  and 
Proximity Potential for Deformed Nuclei(CPPMDN)[27-29]. 

Nuclear theorists have predicted the existence of stability in the upper region of nuclear chart for 
the  last  four  decade  and  are  called  the  island  of  superheavy  elements  (SHE).  The  magic  number  for 

proton  shell  closure  next  to  Z  =  82  is  predicted  to  be  at  Z  =114,120  and  126  and  that of  neutron  shell 
closure  next  to  N  =  126  is  commonly  predicted  to  be  at  N  =184  [30-32].  The  experimentalists  have 
reached  the  shore  of  the  island  of  stability  around  Z  =  120,  124,  or  126  and  N=  184  [33]  through  the 
progress  in  the  accelerator  technologies.  The  study  of  superheavy  element  Z=120  is  of  great  interest, 
because it is useful in determining whether the magic proton shell should be at Z = 114 or at higher proton 
numbers Z = 120–126. 

The short lifetimes and the low production cross sections (in the region of SHE, production cross 
section  is  in the order of pico barn) of the SH elements have posed difficulties to both experimentalists 
and theoreticians in studying the various properties of SH elements. In the calculation of the evaporation 
residue cross section, the reaction process leading to the synthesis of SHE can be divided into three steps. 
First, the projectile is captured by the target by overcoming the Coulomb barrier, which then evolves into 
the compound nucleus and, finally the compound nucleus loses excitation energy and cools down by the 
emission  of  particle  and  gamma  rays  and  goes  into  the  ground  state.  Therefore,  the  cross  section  for 
producing  an  evaporation  residue,  σER  is  the  product  of  capture  cross  section  σCapture,  probability  of 
compound nucleus formation PCN   and the survival probability Wsur  of excited compound nucleus [34-36]. 
For light and medium-heavy projectile-target combination, where the fission barrier is high, each 
capture  event  leads  to  the  formation  of  a  compound  nucleus,  so  σcapture(cid:1)σfusion(cid:1)σER.  But  for  heavy 
systems, especially for more symmetric combination, where the fission barrier is comparatively low and 
those leading to super heavy compound nuclei, the quasi fission process and the deep inelastic scattering, 
which  lead  to  the  two  fragments  in  the  exit  channel,  comes  in  and  competes  with  the  fusion  process 
[35,37]. In this case, only a small part of the capture events are converted to fusion. Hence the complete 
fusion  cross  section  (σfusion/σCN)  is  a  part  of  the  capture  cross  section  σcapture  and  it  is  necessary  to 
distinguish  the  capture  and  fusion  processes  [38].  The  complete  fusion  cross  section  can  be  written  as 
σfusion= σcapture X PCN, where PCN is the probability that complete fusion will occur. 

In 2008, experiments aimed at the synthesis of  isotopes of element Z=120 have been done using 
238U (64Ni, xn) 302-x120 reaction and a cross section limit 90fb at E*=36.4 MeV was obtained [39]. Later in 
2009,  using  the  reaction  244Pu  (58Fe,  xn)  302-x120,  an  attempt  to  produce  Z=120  reaction  have  been 
performed,  yielding  an  upper  limit  of  400fb  [2].  A  cross  section  limit  of  560fb  was  established  in  the 
54Cr+248Cm  reaction  at  SHIP  in  2011[40,  41].  From  the  analysis  of  mass  and  total  kinetic  energy 
distributions,  compound  nucleus  fission  cross  section  were  estimated  experimentally  by  Kozulin  et  al., 
[42],  and  concluded  that  the  combination  64Ni+238U  is  less  favorable  to  synthesis  element  Z  =  120 
compared to the combination 58Fe+244Pu. 

Several  theoretical  studies  [43-56],  are  also  being  done  for  investigating  the  expected  cross 
sections  of  yet  unexplored  reactions  for  the  synthesis  of  new  isotopes  of  element  Z=120.  Predicted 
empirical complete fusion cross sections for superheavy element Z = 120 for the system  252Cf (50Ti, 4n) 
and  208Pb  (87Sr,  n)  by  Loveland  [43]  is  30fb  and  2fb  respectively.  Zagrebaev  et  al.,  [44]  predicted  that 
excitation functions for the production of the Z=120 element using 58Fe+244Pu and 64Ni+238U reactions are 
lower than those of the less symmetric  54Cr+248Cm (see Fig.10 of Ref. [44]). The possibility to synthesis 
the element Z = 120 using  50Ti+249-252Cf was evaluated by Liu et al.,[45] within the  fusion-by-diffusion 
model  and  it was found that the reactions of  250,251Cf (50Ti,3n)  297,298120 and  251,252Cf (50Ti,4n)  297,298120 

 
 
are relatively favorable with the maximum evaporation residue cross sections of 0.12pb, 0.09pb, 0.11pb, 
and 0.25 pb, respectively. Nasirov et al., [49] calculated and compared the fusion and evaporation residue 
cross  sections  of  50Ti+249Cf  and  54Cr+248Cm  systems  and  it  was  found  that  the  evaporation  residue 
excitation  function  for the  more  mass  asymmetric  reaction  50Ti+249Cf  is  higher  in  comparison  with  less 
mass  asymmetric  54Cr+248Cm.  The  maximum  values  of  the  excitation  function  of  the  3n  channel  of  the 
evaporation  residue  formation  of  the  above  system  are  about  100fb  and  55fb  respectively.  Siwek-
Wilczynska et al., [52] predicted the cross sections for the reactions 249Cf (50Ti, xn) 299-x120, for which the 
predicted cross section is only 6 fb. For producing Z = 120, the maximum ER cross section obtained by 
Bao et al., [55] is 0.12 pb by the 3n channel of  50Ti+251Cf. The predicted maximum cross section varies 
greatly,  depending  on  the  models  and  methods  used,  the  overall  uncertainties  in  predicting  the  cross 
section of SHE is examined by Loveland [56]. 

The studies on heavy ion fusion cross section reveals that, the projectile-target combinations, the 
incident  energy,  mass  asymmetry  in  the  entrance  channel  and  excitation  energy  are  the  key  factors  on 
which the fusions cross section strongly dependent.  Hence  it  will  be  interesting and  useful  to  study  
such  dependencies  for  the synthesis of new superheavy elements (SHE). The theoretical predictions will 
be very useful  for the experimentalist to choose the specific combinations with optimum energy and for 
the  estimation  of  cross  section.  The  selection  of  most  promising  projectile-target  combination  is  crucial 
for an experimentalist for the synthesis of new element. 

One of us (KPS) calculated the total fusion cross sections for the fusion of 12C, 16O, 28Si and 35Cl 
on  92Zr target [57];  9Be on  27Al and  64Zn targets, 16O on  64Zn target [58];  16O on  144-154Sm target [59] by 
taking scattering potential as the sum of Coulomb and proximity potential [60] and the computed values 
are  compared  with  experimental  data.  By  using  the  concept  of  cold  reaction  valley  [61],  probable 
projectile target combination for 286112 is also studied [62] and it was found that the systems 82Ge+204Hg, 
80Ge+206Hg and 78Zn+208Pb, 48Ca+238U, 38S+248Cm, 44Ar+242Pu in the cold reaction valley are predicted to 
be the better optimal projectile target combinations for the synthesis of super heavy nuclei  286112. In the 
present work we have studied the cold reaction valley of 302120 SHE for identifying the better projectile-
target  combinations  for  the  synthesis  of  302120.  The  scattering  potential  energy  curves  for  all  probable 
combinations  are  studied.  The  probability  of  compound  nucleus  formation  PCN,  capture  cross  sections 
σcapture, fusion cross sections σfusion, survival probability Wsur and evaporation residue cross section σER for 
the reactions of all the probable projectile-target combinations found in the cold valleys are systematically 
estimated. The details of scattering potential and the methodology used in the estimation of cross section 
are  described  in  Section  II.  In  Section  III,  results  and  discussion  are  given  and  the  entire  work  is 
summarized in Section IV.

B. CROSS SECTION 
1. CAPTURE/TOTAL CROSS SECTION 

To describe the fusion reactions at energies not too much above the barrier and at higher energies, 
the barrier penetration  model developed  by  Wong [64] has been widely used, which obviously  explains 
the experimental result properly.            

The  capture  cross  section  at  a  given  center  of  mass  energy  E  can  be  written  as  the  sum  of  the 

cross section for each partial wave l ,

Lefort and collaborators have shown that not a critical angular  momentum but a critical distance 
of  approach  may  be  the  relevant  quantity  limiting  complete  fusion  during  a  collision  between  two 
complex nuclei [69]. In order to substantiate the finding of a critical distance of approach, it is necessary 
to check the linear dependence of sigma on 1/E in the region of high energy. The value of critical distance 
was found to be

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The  driving  potential,  which  is  the  difference  between  the  interaction  potential  (Coulomb  and 
proximity potential) and Q value of the reaction for all the projectile target combinations of SHE 302120 is 
calculated. For a fixed pair of (AP, AT), a pair of (ZP, ZT) is singled out for which the driving potential is 
minimum, and is plotted as a function of projectile mass number AP. This plot is usually referred to as the 
cold  reaction  valley  plot,  and  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  minima  and  deep  minima  valleys  in  these  plots 
corresponds  to  the  magicity  of  projectile/target  combinations,  and  these  minima  represent  the  most 
probable projectile target combinations for fusion of superheavy element. 

In    the    cold    reaction    valleys    of    superheavy    element  302120,  the  probable  combinations 
observed are 8Be + 294,Lv,10Be + 292Lv, 12C + 290Fl, 14C + 288Fl, 16C + 286Fl, 20O + 282Cn, 22O +280Cn, 24Ne 
+ 278Ds, 26Ne +276Ds, 28Mg + 274Hs, 30Mg + 272Hs, 32Si + 270Sg, 34Si + 268Sg, 36Si+266Sg, 38S + 264Rf, 40S + 
262Rf,  42S  +  260Rf,  etc.  The  three  deep  minima  are  observed  in  the  range  44  <  AP  <  60  (region  I),              
84 < AP < 100 (region II) and 126 <  AP < 138 (region III) which are due to the  magic shell closures of 
either or both the interacting nuclei. The probable combinations observed in the region I of the cold valley 
plot are  44Ar +  258No,  46Ar + 256No, 48Ca +  254Fm,  50Ca +  252Fm,  52Ca +  250Fm,  54Ti +  248Cf,  56Ti +  246Cf, 
58Cr  +  244Cm,  60Cr  +  242Cm;  in  region  II the  combinations  are  84Se  +  218Rn,  86Se  +  216Rn,  88Kr  +  214Po, 
90Kr  +  212Po,  92Sr  +  210Pb,  94Sr  +  208Pb,  96Sr+206Pb,  98Zr+204Hg;  and  in  region  III  the  combinations  are 
124Sn+178Yb, 126Sn+176Yb, 128Sn+174Yb,  130Te+172Er. 

In region I, the minima at  46Ar + 256No are due to the neutron shell closure N=28 of  46Ar and the 
minima at  48Ca +  254Fm,  50Ca +  252Fm,  52Ca +  250Fm are due to the presence of   doubly or near doubly 
magic  nuclei Ca. The combinations  92Sr +  210Pb,  94Sr +  208Pb,  96Sr +206Pb in the region II  is  because of 
doubly  or  near  doubly  magic  nuclei  Pb  and  in  region  III, the  combinations  124Sn+178Yb,  126Sn  +  176Yb, 
128Sn  +174Yb,  130Te+172Er, 132Te  +  170Er  were observed  due  to  near  doubly  magic  nuclei  Sn  and  Te  and 
make  these  systems  as  suitable  projectile-target  combinations  for  the  synthesis  of  super  heavy  nucleus 
302120.  Since  the  above  discussed  combinations  lie  in  the  cold  valleys,  they  are  the  optimal  cases  of 
binary  splitting  and  hence  can  be    identified    as    the    optimal    projectile-target  combinations  for    the  
synthesis    of    super    heavy  element,  with  considerations  to  the  nature  of  interaction  barrier,  potential 
pocket and the probability of CN formation. 

For  all  the  optimal  projectile-target  combinations  identified  in  the  cold  valley  of  super  heavy 
302120  nucleus,  using  Coulomb  and  proximity  potential  as  the  scattering  potential  we  have  studied  the 
interaction  barriers  (scattering  potential  energy  curve)  for the  fusion  of  projectile  and  target  against the 
distance  between  the  centers of  the  colliding  nuclei  and  the  corresponding  barrier  height  VB, the  barrier 
radius RB and the quasi-fission barrier Bqf  (depth of the potential well in the nucleus-nucleus interaction) 
is  noted  with 
 and  the  values  are  given  in  Table  I.  While  analyzing  the  interaction  barrier,  it  was 
found  that  barrier  height  VB  is  increasing  and  quasi-fission  barrier  is  decreasing  with  increasing  atomic 
number of the projectile.

As the part of a systematic study for predicting the most suitable projectile-target combination for 
heavy  ion  fusion  experiments  in  the  synthesis  of  302120,  initially,  considered  the  projectile  target 
combinations 126Sn + 176Yb, 128Sn +174Yb, 130Te + 172Er, 132Te + 170Er found in deep region III of the cold 
valleys  of    302120.  The  interaction  barrier  against the  distance  between  the  centers of  the  projectile  and 

target for the above four combinations are shown in Fig. 2. But, while observing Fig. 2, it is clear that the 
quasi-fission  barrier  that  are  to  be  appreciable  for  the  fusion  to  takes  place  are  shallow,  in  all  the  four 
cases and hence cannot be used as a suitable projectile-target combination for heavy ion fusion reactions. 
Moreover,  the  projectiles  are  comparatively  heavy,  systems  are  nearly  symmetric,  and  those  systems 
leading  to  SHE  302120,  the  quasi-fission  and  deep  inelastic  scattering  compete  with  the  fusion  process 
with reduced probability of forming CN. So combinations in region III are not favorable for fusion.  

While  analyzing  the  interaction  barriers  for  the  rest of  the  combinations  in  the  cold  valley,  it  is 
observed  that the  potential  pocket  is  observed  only  for the  combinations  up to  102Zr+200Hg  system.  The 
barrier  height  VB  and  barrier  radius  RB  and  the  potential  pocket  for  the  102Zr+200Hg  system  are 
318.847MeV,  13.083fm  and  478eV  respectively.  It  is  noted  that,  from  the  interaction  barrier,  for  the 
combinations 84Se + 218Rn, 86Se + 216Rn, 88Kr + 214Po, 90Kr + 212Po (shown in Fig. 3), 92Sr + 210Pb, 94Sr + 
208Pb, 96Sr + 206Pb, 98Zr+204Hg (shown in Fig. 4) found in region II, the potential pocket is small compared 
with that for the combinations 44Ar + 258No, 46Ar + 256No, 48Ca + 254Fm, 50Ca + 252Fm, (shown in Fig. 5); 
52Ca + 250Fm,  54Ti +  248Cf,  56Ti +  246Cf,  58Cr +  244Cm (shown in Fig. 6) found in region I. The  potential  
pocket    is    appreciable  in    the    cases    of  combinations  found  in  the  cold  valley  region  I  and  that  of 
combinations in region II . So, combinations in first deep region and second deep region can be identified 
as the most probable projectile-target combinations for the fusion. Excitation energy of the combinations 
in region I near and above barrier is comparatively higher than that in region II because combinations in 
region  I  are  more  asymmetric.  So  we  can  take  combinations  in  region  I  as  favorable  for  hot  fusion 
reaction and the combinations in region II is favorable for cold fusion reactions. 

Further, in an attempt to predict  more suitable projectile-target, which are  having good potential 
pockets,  we  have  considered  the  projectiles  and  targets  having  comparatively  large  half-lives  and  the 
systems 20O + 282Cn, 36Si + 266Sg, 40S + 262Rf, 62Fe + 240Pu, 64Fe + 238Pu, 66Fe + 236Pu, 68Ni + 234U, 70Ni + 
232U, 72Ni + 230U, 74Zn + 228Th are found in the other cold valley are also feasible for fusion experiments. 
It  is  noted  that  as  the  reaction  asymmetry  increases,  excitation  energy  also  increases.  The  excitation 
energy near and above the barrier for  the combinations  20O +  282Cn,  36Si +  266Sg,  40S +  262Rf, which are 
more  mass  asymmetric  than  the  combinations  in  region  I,  is  comparatively  higher  and  thus  have  less 
survival  probability  to  form  a  evaporation  residue  and  these  combinations  are  not  at  all  favorable  for 
fusion.  Based  on  the  two  simple  arguments  of  reaction  asymmetry  and  excitation  energy,  the 
combinations 20O + 282Cn, 36Si + 266Sg, 40S + 262Rf are not a promising choice for an attempt to synthesize 
the element 302120. 

We  have  evaluated  the  capture  cross  sections  as  a  function  of  center  of  mass  energy  (excitation 
function) for the predicted combinations using Wong formula, approximated Wong formula, and Glas and 
Mosel  formula. The corresponding excitation  function σcapture versus ECM are given  in the upper panel of 
Figs. 14-25. It is found that the Wong formula is in good agreement with the Glas and Mosel formula. 

In  order  to  find  the  fusion  cross  section  for  these  combinations  of  superheavy  302120,  the 
knowledge  of  probability  of  compound  nucleus  formation  PCN  is  a  must  and  is  determined  using  the 
equation (21) and are plotted against excitation energy of compound nucleus which are shown in Figs. 7-
12.  It  is  found  that,  PCN  for  the  combinations  in  region  II  (less  asymmetric  cold  combinations)  is  very 
small as compared to combinations in region I (more asymmetric hot combination). It is found that PCN is 

larger  for more asymmetric  hot combination. For a given excitation energy (E*=35 MeV  for hot fusion 
reaction, E* = 5 MeV for cold fusion reaction), it can also be seen from the Fig. 13 that PCN is larger for 
the more asymmetric hot fusion combinations. Fusion probability increases with increasing quasi-fission 
barrier height (potential pocket) and the incident energies in the reactions leading to the SHE. 

Near and above the barrier, using the  values of PCN for each center of  mass energy,  fusion cross 
section  is  computed  by  using  the  equation  σfusion=  σcapture  X  PCN    for  the  above  systems  and  the 
corresponding fusion excitation functions (σfusion versus ECM plots) are shown in upper panels of Figs.14-
25.  From  the  plots  it  can  be  seen  that  computed  fusion  cross  section  for  combinations  in  the  first  deep 
region 44 < AP < 58 is in the order of micro barn, which is higher than in the second region 84 < AP < 100, 
where  the  fusion  cross  section  is  in  the  order  of  pico  barn  and  for  the  combinations  in  region                   
60 < AP < 82, fusion cross section is in between that of region I and II. The fusion cross sections for more 
asymmetric (and “hotter”) fusion reactions found to be higher than symmetric “colder” combinations. The 
combinations with large fusion cross sections are the ones which are more asymmetric and having more 
potential pockets (quasi-fission barrier).  

For  the  de-excitation  stage,  the  survival  probability 

surW  is  calculated  by  using  the  formalism 
discussed in sub section 3.1. We calculated the evaporation residue cross sections for the 2n, 3n, 4n and 
5n evaporation channels for the hot combinations, and 1n evaporation channel for the cold combinations 
and  plotted  in  the  lower  panels  of  Figs.  14-25.  The  predictions  of  the  maximum  value  of  the  ER  cross 
sections  of  all  the  probable  combinations  are  presented  in  Table  2.  The  calculated  cross  section  for  3n 
channel  (84.21fb)  and  4n  channel  (15.67fb)  is  larger  for  the  reaction  48Ca+254Fm  and  2n  cross  section 
(325.21fb) is larger for 68Ni+234U. Predicted 1n cross section (shown in lower panel of figures 22-25) for 
cold fusion combinations is too small as compared to hot fusion combinations. So to synthesize element 
Z=120, our study reveals that, hot fusion reaction is preferable. 

As shown in Fig. 14(c) and 14(d), maximum ER cross section (2n and 3n) for 46Ar+256No is found 
to  be  higher  than  44Ar+258No.  Also  among  the  combinations  48Ca+254Fm,  50Ca+252Fm  and  52Ca+250Fm 
(Fig. 15(c), 15(d) and 16(c)), our result shows that σER is larger for 48Ca +254Fm and is the most favorable 
projectile target combination.  The ER cross sections for 54Ti+248Cf (Fig.16 (d)) are higher than 56Ti+246Cf 
(Fig  17(c)).  Among  the  combinations  58Cr+244Cm  (Fig.  17(d)),  60Cr+242Cm  (Fig18(c)),  latter reaction  is 
more  favorable  to  2n  channel  and  former  reaction  is  favorable  to  3n  and  4n  channel.  Similarly  for  the 
reactions  62Fe+240Pu (Fig.18 (d)), 64Fe+238Pu (Fig19(c)) and  66Fe+236Pu (Fig.19 (d)), σER (2n) is  more for 
64Fe+238Pu  whereas  σER (3n  and  4n)  is  more  for  62Fe+240Pu.  The  ER  cross  sections  of  68Ni+234U  (Fig. 
20(c)) are more than  70Ni+232U (Fig.20 (d)) and  72Ni+230U (Fig. 21(c)) systems. Based on the arguments 
of  quasi-fission  barrier,  reaction  asymmetry,  excitation  energy,  probability  of  compound  nucleus 
formation and survival probability, the most promising choice for an attempt to synthesize element 302120 
are 44Ar + 258No, 46Ar + 256No, 48Ca + 254Fm, 50Ca + 252Fm, 54Ti + 248Cf, 58Cr + 244Cm, 62Fe + 240Pu, 64Fe + 
238Pu, 68Ni + 234U, 70Ni + 232U, 72Ni + 230U, 74Zn + 228Th. 

In order to check the consistency of our calculations, we have evaluated the capture, fusion, and 
evaporation  residue  cross  sections  of  four  reactions,  54Cr+248Cm,  58Fe+244Pu,  64Ni+238U  and  50Ti+249Cf, 
for which several theoretical studies and attempt to produce the element Z=120 were done. Fig. 26 shows 
the predicted capture, fusion and ER cross section for 54Cr+248Cm and 58Fe+244Pu systems. The calculated 

3n  and  4n  channel  ER  cross  sections  for  the  reaction  54Cr+248Cm  (Fig.  26(c))  is  15.4fb  and  5.04fb 
respectively and for 58Fe+244Pu reaction (Fig. 26(d)), it is found to be 6.12fb and 2.78fb respectively. The 
excitation functions for 64Ni+238U and 50Ti+249Cf shown in Fig. 27. The 3n and 4n channel maximum ER 
cross  section  for  64Ni+238U  (Fig.  27(c))  are  7.81fb  and  1.49fb  respectively,  and  that  of  50Ti+249Cf  (Fig. 
27(d))  are  102.92fb  and  2.264fb  respectively.  We  have  observed  that  the  more  mass  asymmetric 
50Ti+249Cf  is  more  favorable  to  synthesize  element  Z=120  because  3n  and  4n  evaporation  residue  cross 
section are much larger than the maximal values for the other reactions. To compare the results with other 
models,  we  listed  the  maximum  ER  cross  sections  (3n  and  4n)  for  the  combinations  54Cr+248Cm, 
58Fe+244Pu, 64Ni+238U and  50Ti+249Cf in Tables 3 and 4. The calculated maximum 3n and 4n evaporation 
residue cross sections for the above mentioned combinations are of the same order with other theoretical 
models and 50Ti+249Cf is found to the more feasible combination in all the theoretical studies, which very 
well  establishes  the  reliability  of  our  work.  Note  that  experimental  upper  limit  for  above  reactions 
58Fe+244Pu,  64Ni+238U  and  54Cr+248Cm  had  been  established  at  400fb[2],  90fb[39],  560fb[40,41] 
respectively and an attempt was done using the reactions  50Ti+249Cf [85]. Recently  Hofmann et al., [86] 
measured  the  cross  section  for  the  three  event  chain  observed  in  the  reaction  54Cr+248Cm  tentatively

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

Probable target- projectile combinations  for the super heavy  element  302120 have  been  identified 
from  the  cold  reaction  valleys.  We  have  calculated  the  interaction  barriers  for  the  fusion  of  all  the 
projectile-target  combinations  identified  in  the  cold  valleys  of  super  heavy  302120  nucleus,  against  the 
distance between the centers of the projectile and target by taking Coulomb and proximity potential as the 
scattering potential. Near and above the barrier, the total capture, fusion and ER cross sections for all the 
systems also have been calculated. The systems  44Ar +  258No,  46Ar +  256No,  48Ca +254Fm,  50Ca +  252Fm, 
52Ca + 250Fm, 54Ti + 248Cf, 56Ti + 246Cf, 58Cr + 244Cm in the deep region I of cold valley, and the systems 
60Cr + 242Cm, 62Fe + 240Pu, 64Fe + 238Pu, 66Fe + 236Pu, 68Ni + 234U, 70Ni + 232U, 72Ni + 230U, 74Zn + 228Th in 
the  cold  valleys  are  identified  as  the  better  projectile  target  combinations  for  the  synthesis  of  302120. 
While  considering  the  nature  of  quasi-fission  barrier  height  and  half-lives  of  colliding  nuclei,  mass 
asymmetry,  probability  of  compound  nucleus  formation,  survival  probability  and  excitation  energy,  the 
systems 44Ar + 258No, 46Ar + 256No, 48Ca + 254Fm, 50Ca + 252Fm, 54Ti + 248Cf, 58Cr + 244Cm, 62Fe + 240Pu, 
64Fe  +  238Pu,  68Ni  +  234U,  70Ni  +  232U,  72Ni  +  230U,  74Zn  +  228Th  give  maximum  probability  for  the 
synthesis  of  super  heavy  nucleus  302120.  The  computed  ER  cross  section  for  54Cr+248Cm,  58Fe+244Pu, 
64Ni+238U  and  50Ti+249Cf  combinations  are  compared  with  experimental  data  and  other  theoretical 
models,  and  all  models  predicted  the  maximum  cross  section  for  the  combination  50Ti+249Cf,  which 
proves reliability of our work. Through our extensive study, we predict several promising possibilities for 
the synthesis of SHE 302120.
