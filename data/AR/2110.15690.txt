We present the angular proﬁles of the triple differential cross-section (TDCS) for the (e,2e) process on the
noble gas atoms, namely He (1s), Ne (2s and 2p), and Ar (3p) for the plane wave and the twisted electron impact.
We develop the theoretical formalism in the ﬁrst-born approximation. The present study compares the TDCS
for different values of orbital angular momentum number m and opening angles θp of the twisted electron beam
with that of the plane wave beam. In addition, we also investigate the TDCS for macroscopic atomic targets
to explore the inﬂuence of opening angle θp of the twisted electron beam on the TDCS. Our results show that
the peaks in binary and recoil region shift from the momentum transfer direction. The results also show that
for larger opening angles the peaks for p-type orbitals split into double-peak structures which are not observed
in the plane wave results for the given kinematics. The angular proﬁles for averaged cross-section show the
dependence of TDCS on the opening angles which are signiﬁcantly different from the plane wave TDCS.

INTRODUCTION

The process of electron impact

ionization (hereafter
referred as an (e,2e) process) of various atomic and molecular
targets frequently ﬁnds an important place in many ﬁelds.
ionization has practical
To name a few, electron impact
applications in plasma physics, atmospheric physics,
ra-
diation physics, astronomy, and even biology [1–5]. A
single electron is ejected from the target in a coincident
(e,2e) process when interacting with an incident electron.
The ejected and scattered electrons are detected with their
momenta fully resolved [6]. Experimental research in this
ﬁeld was ﬁrst performed by Erhardt et al. [7] and Amaldi et
al. [8] independently. Since then, there has been tremendous
progress in the theoretical and experimental study of electron
impact ionization processes. The way we generally study an
(e,2e) process is through the triple differential cross-section
(TDCS). The TDCS is proportional to the probability of
detecting the two outgoing electrons (the ejected electron and
the scattered electron) in coincidence with their momenta
fully resolved. Measuring and analyzing the TDCS of
(e,2e) processes can provide valuable insight into collision
mechanisms and electronic structure of the given target and
serve as very strict tests on theoretical models of few-body
quantum dynamics.

After decades of progress in theoretical models aimed at
describing (e,2e) processes, we now have models that can
fully explain the cross-sections of simple targets such as H
and He atoms [9, 10]. However, current theoretical models
still struggle to fully understand the dynamics for more
complex targets, such as molecules and multi-electron atoms.
Among these complex targets are inert gas atoms, such as
Ne, Ar and Xe. Theoretical models for atomic H and He that
give good agreement with experimental results, such as the
BBK method [11], yield discrepancies for heavier atoms in
the intermediate and low energy regimes. Signiﬁcant efforts
have been made to develop theoretical models that agree
with experimental TDCS results of inert atoms. Bell et al.

[12] measured experimental TDCS results for Argon (3p)
electrons in co-planar geometry and compared them with
theoretical results using distorted wave Born approximation
(DWBA). Brothers et al.
[13] calculated theoretical cross
sections for Ne (2s), Ne (2p), Ar (2p), and Ar (3p) using
the factorized plane-wave Born approximation. The BBK
and the DWBA+R-matrix (close coupling) models were
also used to describe TDCS of He (1s) and Ar (3p) [14].
Kheifets et al.
[15] used the DWBA-G (DWBA corrected
by the Gamow factor) model to include the post-collision
interactions with the Gamow factor for calculating TDCS of
He (1s), Ne (2s), Ne (2p), and Ar (3p). Other sophisticated
like a convergent close-coupling, DWBA-G, and
models,
a hybrid DWBA+R-matrix method, are also used for the
calculation of the TDCS for Ne and Xe ionization process
[16]. Pﬂüger et al. [17] used the non-perturbative B-spline R
Matrix (BSR [18]) approach to calculate low incident energy
Ne (2p) TDCS. Ren et al. [19] used different models to study
Ne (2p) ionization at low energies, including second order
DWBA-RM model, BSR model, three-body distorted wave
(3DW) model and distorted-wave Born approximation with
The TDCSs

have also been calculated for Ar (3p) and Ar (3s) atoms in
the modiﬁed distorted wave formalism using the second Born
approximation [20]. Very recently, Gong et al.
[21] used
the multi-center three distorted wave method(MCTDW) to
calculate Ne(2p) TDCS at low incident energies.

There have been several undertakings to improve the agree-
ment between experimental and theoretical data for the plane
wave ionization of inert atoms. However, it is still to be ex-
plored for the twisted beam impact ionization of the same.
Unlike plane waves, twisted electron beams carry a well-
deﬁned orbital angular momentum (OAM) along the beam
axis. This non-zero OAM stems from the usual phase fac-
tor of eimφ . In addition to quantized OAM, they also have a
non-zero transverse linear momentum, and non-uniform in-
tensity in the transverse direction [22, 23]. Inspired by op-
tical vortex beams, many experimental groups have recently
demonstrated the production of electron vortex beams with
several orders of phase singularity and the corresponding an-
gular momentum[24, 25]. Different experimental groups have
been successful in generating electron vortex with very high

 
 
 
 
 
 
angular momentum: up to 1000¯h [26, 27]. These laboratory
realizations of vortex beams have stirred up a brand new area
of research and boast promising applications. There is a scope
for applications in transmission electron microscopy(TEM),
ﬁne probing of matter, surveying magnetic properties of novel
materials, investigating chiral properties of crystals, strong-
ﬁeld ionization, transfer of angular momentum to nanoparti-
cles, etc.[28, 29]. The quantized OAM possessed by electron
vortex beams acts as a new degree of freedom in electron-
target collision studies. Changing this new degree of freedom
may have interesting effects, and therefore, we must investi-
gate the impact of OAM on collision cross-sections.

Pioneering studies by Boxem et al. [28, 30, 31] inspired
further research in this direction. Serbo et al.
[32] ana-
lyzed twisted electron scattering in the relativistic regime and
showed that the cross-section for bulk targets must be inte-
grated over all possible impact parameters. This integral elim-
inates any dependence on the ‘m’ value or the amount of OAM
associated with the twisted beam. Matula et al. [33] studied
the role of angular momentum in radiative capture of twisted
electrons by bare hydrogen-like ions. Using a theoretical anal-
ysis of twisted Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS)
from C60 fullerene, Schüler and Berakdar investigated the ef-
fects of OAM transfer on plasmon generation [34]. Koshleva
et al. calculated the cross-sections for twisted electron Mott
scattering by atomic targets in the fully relativistic regime
[35]. Using the ﬁrst Born approximation, Maiorova et al.
investigated the elastic scattering of twisted electrons by H2
molecule [36]. Harris et al. [23] calculated the fully differen-
tial cross-section corresponding to twisted electron wave ion-
ization of hydrogen atom. The FDCS showed a shift in recoil
and binary peak positions due to the transverse momentum
component. Dhankhar et al. reported theoretical calculations
of the ﬁve-fold differential cross-section of double ionization
of He atom by twisted waves in θ variable mode and constant
θ12-mode [37]. The study by Mandal et al. (2020) showed the
dependence of the Total Angular Momentum (TAM) number
(m) and opening angle (θp) on the angular proﬁle of the TDCS
and spin asymmetry for the relativistic electron impact ioniza-
tion of the heavy atomic targets [38]. Dhankhar et al. inves-
tigated the inﬂuence of the OAM number ‘m’ and the open-
ing angle θp single ionization cross-sections of H2 and H2O
molecule by twisted electron waves independently [39, 40].

In this communication, we extend our previous studies (for
(e,2e) process on H2 and H2O) of the differential cross-section
by the twisted electron beam on the inert gas atoms. We
present the theoretical estimation for the ionization of noble
gas atoms, namely He, Ne (2s and 2p), and Ar (3p) for the
twisted electron beam. Our theoretical calculations are within
the ﬁrst Born approximation framework for an incident plane
wave electron beam and an incident twisted electron beam.
We describe the plane wave, Roothan-Hartree-Fock wave-
function, Coulomb wave for the scattered electron, the bound
states of He, Ne, and Ar, and the ejected electron, respectively.
We present the theoretical formalism of our calculation of the
TDCS in Sec.II. We present our results of the TDCS for the
different outer orbitals of the atoms for different parameters
of the twisted electron beam in Sec.III. Finally, we conclude

our paper in the Sec.IV. Atomic units are used throughout the
paper unless otherwise stated.

II. THEORETICAL FORMALISM

In this study, we have calculated the TDCS for (e,2e) pro-

cess on inert gas atoms :

e−i + X

→

e−s + e−e + X +.

(1)

here, e−i , e−s , e−e , X and X + represents the incident, scattered,
the ejected electron, the target atom and the ionized target
respectively.
The theory used here closely follows the
approach used in our previous studies [39, 40]. We have
the theoretical analysis in the framework of
carried out
the ﬁrst Born approximation. We have also neglected the
exchange effects between the incident/scattered electron with
the bound/ejected electron here since the incident/scattered
electron is faster than the bound/ejected electron (Es >> Ee).

The triple differential cross section for an (e,2e) process of

an inert gas can be written as,

here, dΩe and dΩs denote differential intervals of the solid
angles of the ejected and scattered electrons respectively. dEe
denotes the energy interval of the ejected electron. ki, ks, and
ke are the momentum vectors of the incident, scattered and
ejected electrons respectively. The plane wave scattering am-
plitude is given by,

where q = ki −
ks is the momentum transfer vector, φi is the
initial state wave function of the system, and φ f is the ﬁnal
state wave function. V is the interaction potential between
the incident electron and the multi-electron target atom.
In
this communication we use the frozen-core approximation, in
which the problem of N (total number of electrons in the target
atom) electrons can be reduced to one active electron problem.
In this approximation, we assume that only one of the target
electrons (from the outer orbital of the target atom) participate
in the ionization process and is ejected in the ﬁnal channel,
while the other electrons remain as frozen. The interaction
potential under the approximation is then deﬁned as,

V = −
r1

+

r12

,

(4)

In the above equation, the ﬁrst term represents the Coulomb
interaction of the incident electron with the nucleus of the in-
ert gas atom, with r1 as the distance from the nucleus to the
incident electron. The second term is the Coulomb interac-
tion between the incident electron and the participating bound
electron, with r12 as the separation between the two electrons.
For calculating the transition matrix element, we have used
the following assumptions:

2

• The incident and the scattered electrons are both treated

as plane waves.

The transition matrix element is then given by the following
expression

• The Roothaan-Hartree-Fock wave functions represent
the participating bound electron wave function of the
target atom. These atomic wave functions are given by
a combination of Slater orbitals using Clementi-Roetti
(CR) coefﬁcients [41], where Slater orbitals take the
following general form [6],

χnlm(r) = N(n, α)rn
1e−
−

αrYlm(θ , φ ).

(5)

Here n, l, m are the quantum numbers of the atomic or-
bital, α is the orbital exponent, Ylm(θ , φ ) are the com-
plex spherical harmonics, and

N(n, α) =

2

(2α)n+ 1
[(2n)!]

(6)

is the normalization constant.

• The ejected electron is described by a Coulomb wave,
(r2). This way, the long-range effects of the residual

Ψ−ke
ion on the slow electron are taken into account.

We can then write the initial wave function as;

φi = χki(r1)Φ j(r2),

(7)

where χki(r1) is the normalized incident electron plane wave,
and Φ j(r2) is the jth Hartree-Fock atomic orbital from CR
coefﬁcients of the target atom and is described as;

Φ j(r2) =

N
∑
i=1

ciχnilimi(r2),

(8)

where i is the ith basis function, ci is the expansion coefﬁcient
of the atomic orbital for the ith basis function and χnilimi(r2)
is given by equation 5. Similarly, the ﬁnal state wave function
can be written as

φ f = χks (r1)ψ −ke

(r2),

(9)

where χks (r1) is approximated by plane wave, and ψ −ke
approximated by the Coulomb wave, described as;

The extension to twisted wave scattering in this formalism is
straightforward. We change the incident electron wave func-
tion from a plane wave to a twisted wave propagating along z-
axis. Similar to our previous studies, we have used the Bessel
beam [31] to represent the incident electron that carries quan-
tized angular momentum. In this case, the incident momen-
tum vector ki has a transverse component and is given by the
following expression.

ki = (ki sin θp cos φp) ˆx + (ki sin θp sin φp) ˆy + (ki cos θp)ˆz.

(13)
Here, θp and φp are the polar and azimuthal angles of the mo-
mentum vector respectively. ki carves out the surface of a
cone when we change φp. The longitudinal component of the
momentum kiz is ﬁxed, but the transverse momentum compo-
nent ki
has a direction that depends on φp. This means that
the direction of incident momentum is not well deﬁned. How-
ever, the magnitude of the transverse momentum is ﬁxed, and
(kiz)2. The opening angle of

the cone can be calculated as θp = arctan( ki

The phase singularity of the eimφp is responsible for the quan-
tized angular momentum content of the twisted wave, and the
delta factor ensures that the magnitude of the transverse mo-
iki.b fac-
mentum is well deﬁned. Also, the addition of the e−
tor accounts for the transverse orientation of the incident beam
with respect to the target. Here, b is the impact parameter vec-
tor measured with respect to the axis of the incident wave. Un-
like the plane wave, the Bessel beam has concentric rings of
high and low-intensity in the transverse direction [43]. There-
fore, we need to account for the orientation of the target with
respect to the incident beam.

When we replace the incident plane wave by the twisted
wave, we get the following expression for twisted wave matrix

(18)
θs and φs are the polar and azimuth angles of the scattered
electron momentum vector ks, which is described by a
plane wave in our treatment. Unlike the plane wave, the
momentum transfer of a twisted wave is not constant for a
particular direction of ks, and depends on the azimuthal angle
of the incident wave vector ki. This inherent uncertainty of
momentum transfer direction for a twisted wave is accounted
for by taking an integral over the azimuthal angle φp in
equation 16.

We can now calculate the TDCS for twisted waves using

4

equation 16 and equation 12 for the target ﬁxed with respect
to the incident beam. However, since scattering experiments
are usually characterized by a uniform distribution of scatter-
ing centers ( inert atoms in our case) over a certain volume, we
cannot assume a ﬁxed value of impact parameter b. Instead,
we need to average over all possible values of b for mean-
ingful results that can be compared with experimental results.
The details of averaging over all possible orientations can be
found in [23, 32], and average TDCS can be written as ;

TDCS independent of the OAM value ‘m’[32]. However, this
does not mean that twisted wave TDCS is the same as plane
wave TDCS since the transverse momentum component of
twisted waves plays a direct role in the momentum transfer.
The cross-section now depends on the opening angle θp of
the incident twisted electron beam.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We present the results of our calculations for the TDCS for
noble gas atoms viz., Helium (1s), Neon (2s and 2p orbitals),
and Argon (3p) by a twisted electron beam impact in this sec-
tion. We benchmark our theoretical calculations with the ex-
isting experimental data for the plane wave. We present the
results of the TDCS for twisted electron beam to study the ef-
fects of different parameters of the beam on TDCS. We com-
pare our twisted electron beam TDCS with that of the plane
wave TDCS for different values of orbital angular momentum
(OAM) number m and opening angle θp. For the given m,
we compare the TDCS’s proﬁles for the different values of θp
, viz. 1°, 6°, 15° and 20°. The kinematics we have used

From ﬁgure 1, we observe that our theoretical model repro-
duces the experimental results reasonably well in the binary
region for all the cases. The theory, however, underestimates
the recoil peak for most of the cases. This may be explained
by the fact that our theoretical model uses a 1-Coulomb wave-
function (1CW) for the ejected electron. The experimental
results are on a relative scale, so we have scaled them to com-

pare the results of our theoretical model in the binary peak re-
gion. The plane wave TDCS proﬁle represents a binary peak
and a recoil peak along the momentum transfer directions θq
q respectively for both the kinematics. For the plane
and θ
wave ionization, we also observe that the magnitude of the
TDCS decreases with an increase in the ejected electron en-
ergy.

B. Angular proﬁles of the TDCS for the twisted electron wave

In this section, we present the results of our calculations for
TDCS with the twisted electron beam for Es = 500eV, Ee

7

= 37eV and 74eV and θs = 6° in the co-planar asymmetric
geometrical mode for He, Ne (2s and 2p sub-shell) and Ar
(3p). Here, we study the effect of twisted electron beam on
the TDCS by varying OAM number m as well as the opening
angle θp. Figures 2-5 represent the TDCS for an incident
twisted electron beam for the noble gas atoms for different
values of m and θp. In ﬁgures 2-6, the black, orange, green,
blue and red curves represents the TDCS for plane wave

(pw), θp = 1°, 6°, 15° and 20° respectively. In the ﬁgures 2-5,
frames (a),(d); (b),(e) and (c),(f) depict the TDCS for m = 1, 2
and 3 respectively for the ejected electron energies 37eV and
74eV.

We have used different scaling factors to compare the
TDCS for the twisted electron beam with the plane wave
TDCS as shown in tables I-IV. For all the cases considered
here, the magnitude of TDCS is the lowest for the smallest
opening angle i.e. θp = 1° (see scaling factors for θp = 1°
in tables I-IV). The angular proﬁles for the TDCS at θp =
1°and for m = 1 and 3, predict peaks in the binary and recoil
regions for He and Ne (2s), and a peak in the binary region
only for Ne(2p) and Ar (3p) (see orange curves for m = 1 and
3 in ﬁgures 2-5). The peaks, however, are shifted from the
momentum transfer direction (see orange curves in ﬁgures
2-5 for m = 1 and 3 around the arrows). At the same opening
angle and m = 2, we observe the peaks along the momentum
transfer directions for He, Ne(2p) and Ar (see orange curves
in ﬁgures 2, 4, 5 for m = 2 around the arrows). However, for
Ne (2s) at θp = 1° and m = 2, we observe peaks in the forward
and backward regions (see orange curves in ﬁgure 3 (b) and
(e)).

When the opening angle is same as the scattering angle

i.e., θp = θs, we observe peaks in the forward and backward
direction for most of the cases (see green curves in the ﬁgures
2-5 around θe = 0°(or 360°) and 180°). However, for He and
Ne (2s), we observe peaks in the forward and perpendicular
directions for m = 1 only (see green curves in the ﬁgures 2 (a)
and (d) and 3 (a) and (d) around θe = 0°(or 360°) and 90°).
For all the cases, a minimum is observed around the plane
wave momentum transfer direction. Similar observation has
also been accounted in our previous communication for the
water molecule [40] and by Harris et al.
for the hydrogen
atom [23].

On further increasing the opening angle of the incident
beam to 15°, some interesting results are observed. The
magnitude of the TDCS decreases as θp is increased from
6°. For the s-orbitals (He and Ne (2s)), the angular proﬁle of
the TDCS at θp = 15° represents a two peak structure around
the perpendicular directions with the dominant peak close
to θe = 270° and a shallow peak around θe = 90° (see blue
curves in ﬁgures 2 and 3), except for Ee = 74eV and m = 1.
For Ee = 74eV and m = 1, the dominant peak is around 90°
(see blue curve in ﬁgure 2(d) and 3(d) around θe = 90° and
270°). For Ne (2p) and Ar (3p) at θp = 15°, the peak around
θe = 90° splits and we observe a double-peak structure which
is a characteristic of the p-dominant atomic orbitals. The
double-peak structure in the TDCS is observed only for m =

1 for Ee = 37eV and for all values of m in the TDCS for Ee
= 74eV for Ne (2p) and Ar (3p) (see blue curves in ﬁgures 4
and 5).

For an opening angle θp = 20°, the angular proﬁles of
the ionization cross-sections is somewhat similar to those ob-
served for θp = 15°. We observe peaks approximately around
θe = 90° and 270° as observed earlier for He and Ne (2s) (see
red curves in ﬁgures 2 and 3). For Ne (2p) and Ar (3p), at
lower energy of the ejected electron i.e. Ee = 37eV, we ob-
serve a shallow peak and a double-peak structure (similar to
the one observed at θp = 15° for the same atoms) around θe
= 90° and 270° respectively for most of the cases. However,
for Ee = 74eV and m = 1, we observe a dominant peak and a
shallow double-peak structure around θe = 270° and 90° re-

spectively. For the same ejected electron energy and m = 2
and 3, we observe a dominant peak and a shallow peak in the
perpendicular directions (see red curves in ﬁgures 4-5 around
θe = 90° and 270°). Due to the additional transverse momen-
tum, we observe peak splitting for the twisted electron TDCS
at higher opening angles only, i.e., for θp = 15° and 20° for the
Ne (2p) and Ar (3p). The present calculations of the TDCS for
twisted electron wave on the noble gas atoms clearly show the
dependence of TDCS on both m and θp.

and 2p shells) and Ar (3p) noble gases in the co-planar asym-
metric geometry. As shown by the equation 19, the (TDCS)av
depends only on the opening angle θp of the incident twisted
electron beam. We keep the same kinematics as used in the
earlier ﬁgures. We compare the results of the averaged cross-
section ((TDCS)av) with the plane wave TDCS. We present
the angular proﬁles for θp = 1°, 6°, 15° and 20°. For a bet-
ter comparison of the (TDCS)av with the plane wave TDCS,
we have scaled the (TDCS)av for θp = 15° and 20° by a fac-
tor of 5. We have not used any scaling factors for θp = 1°
and 6°. From ﬁgure 6, we observe that for the smallest open-
ing angle, i.e. θp = 1°, the angular proﬁle of the (TDCS)av
is similar to that of the plane wave TDCS for all the atoms
(see orange curves in the ﬁgure 6). For θp = θs = 6°, we
observe peaks in the forward and backward direction with a
small peak around the plane wave momentum transfer direc-
tion for He only (see green curves around the arrows in ﬁgure
6 (a) and (e)). For higher opening angles, like 15° and 20°, we
observe that the angular proﬁles represent a two peak structure
with peaks around the perpendicular directions (θe = 90° and
270°). For both the opening angles, the dominant peak is ap-
proximately around θe = 270° and the shallow peak is located
close to θe = 90° except for He, wherein for Ee 74eV and θp
= 15° the dominant and shallow peak is located around θe =
90° and 270° which is in contrast to all the other cases for θp
= 15°. We also observe that the magnitude of (TDCS)av de-
creases with an opening angle. It can be seen from equations
2 and 12 that the plane wave TDCS is inversely proportional
to the quad of momentum transfer magnitude. Thus, in com-
puting the (TDCS)av, the plane wave TDCS from azimuthal
angles with smaller momentum transfer magnitude will dom-
inate the average, thus resulting in a shift of binary peak to the
recoil direction for higher θp (for more details see [44]).

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented the theoretical study of
the triple differential cross-sections (TDCS) for an (e,2e) pro-
cess on different noble gas atoms (He, Ne (2s and 2p), and Ar

(3p)) by the twisted electron beam. We studied the angular
distributions of the TDCS for the co-planar asymmetric ge-
ometry in the ﬁrst Born approximation for both the plane and
twisted electron beam. We have studied the effect of the OAM
number, m and the opening angle θp of the incident twisted
electron beam on the TDCS. We have benchmarked our the-
oretical results with the experimental data for the plane wave
electron beam.
For the (e,2e) ionization of the noble gas atoms by twisted
electron impact, the angular proﬁle of the TDCS is altered
from the plane wave case. We also observe that the magni-
tude of the TDCS for twisted electron wave impact is smaller.
For the plane waves, the angular proﬁle of the TDCS peaks
around θq (binary peak) and θ
q (recoil peak). However, for
−
the twisted electron beam, due to the additional transverse mo-
mentum and the phase (OAM (m)) dependence of the incident
twisted electron beam, the angular proﬁles of the TDCS for
twisted electron case the peaks are shift from the momentum
transfer directions for a smaller opening angle. A minimum
occurs around the plane wave momentum transfer direction
when θp = θs. For higher opening angles, like 15° and 20°, we
observe peaks in the perpendicular directions. At these open-
ing angles, we also observe that the peaks split into double-
peak structures for p-type orbitals (Ne (2p) and Ar (3p)). In
addition, we discuss the (TDCS)av (averaged over the impact
parameter b) as a function of the opening angle θp of the
twisted electron beam. For a macroscopic target, the angu-
lar proﬁles of (TDCS)av signiﬁcantly depend on the opening
angle (θp) of the twisted electron beam. At smaller open-
ing angle, like θp = 1°, the (TDCS)av is similar to the plane
wave TDCS. However, for higher opening angles i.e. 15° and
20° the peaks shift to perpendicular directions. The results
of (TDCS)av show the dependence of momentum transfer and
thus the averaged cross-section on the opening angle of the
incident twisted electron beam.

Our present communication attempts to investigate the
(e,2e) process on the noble gas atoms to unravel the effects
of the twisted electron’s different parameters on the angular
proﬁle of the TDCS. We have used the 1CW wave function in
our theoretical model to study the TDCS. The present study
can also be extended for other complex theoretical models,
like DWBA, CCC, 2C, etc.. We are working on this aspect.
