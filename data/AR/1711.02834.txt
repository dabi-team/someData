BOOTSTRAPPING GENERALIZATION ERROR BOUNDS
FOR TIME SERIES

By Robert Lunde and Cosma Rohilla Shalizi∗

Carnegie Mellon University

We consider the problem of ﬁnding conﬁdence intervals for the
risk of forecasting the future of a stationary, ergodic stochastic pro-
cess, using a model estimated from the past of the process. We show
that a bootstrap procedure provides valid conﬁdence intervals for the
risk, when the data source is suﬃciently mixing, and the loss func-
tion and the estimator are suitably smooth. Autoregressive (AR(d))
models estimated by least squares obey the necessary regularity con-
ditions, even when mis-speciﬁed, and simulations show that the ﬁnite-
sample coverage of our bounds quickly converges to the theoretical,
asymptotic level. As an intermediate step, we derive suﬃcient con-
ditions for asymptotic independence between empirical distribution
functions formed by splitting a realization of a stochastic process, of
independent interest.

1. Introduction. Suppose we have observed data points Y1, . . . , Yt ≡
Y1:t from a stationary stochastic process Y , and want to predict Yt+1 using
a model ˆft estimated from the observations. As in any other statistical pre-
diction problem, we want to be able to evaluate how well we will forecast,
and in particular make an estimate of the expected performance, or risk,
of the model, i.e., estimate the expected loss L(Yt+1, ˆft) for some suitable
loss function. While several diﬀerent notions of risk have been proposed for
time series [40, 27], we follow Shalizi and Kontorovich [49], deﬁning risk as
the long-term average of instantaneous expected losses, conditioned on the
observations:

1Thus, for example, if we used an AR(1) model, with parameter θ, the estimator ˆθt
would be a function of Y1:t alone, but the prediction at time t + i would be ˆθt(Y1:t)Yt+i−1.

Kontorovich [49] show that this is well-deﬁned for ergodic sources. Accepting
this notion of risk, how might we estimate it? Suppose ˆft takes as input some
ﬁxed vector Zi = (Yi, . . . , Yi+d+1) and let t0 = t−d+1. Clearly, the in-sample
performance of ˆft on the training data Y1:t:

L(zi, ˆft)

will generally be overly optimistic an estimate of out-of-sample performance,
precisely because the model has been adjusted to ﬁt that speciﬁc time series
(and not another). We thus wish to know the “generalization error” of the
model η( ˆft) ≡ R( ˆft) − ˆR( ˆft). It is particularly helpful to control the proba-
bility that η( ˆft) exceeds any given value, i.e., to probabilistically bound how
much worse than its in-sample performance ˆft might really be.

In this paper, we give asymptotically-valid generalization error bounds
for time-series forecasting. To do this, it is clearly suﬃcient to have a con-
1−α( ˆft),
sistent estimator for the 1 − α quantile of the generalization error η∗
since that lets us give a probabilistic guarantee for worst-case out-of-sample
performance of our model:

(3)

P ( ˆRt( ˆft) + η∗

1−α( ˆft)) > 1 − α

Following an idea proposed in McDonald [32, sec. 8.3], we achieve this by
using the block bootstrap [26] to directly simulate estimating a model from
a time series, and then evaluating the ﬁtted model’s ability to forecast the
continuation of the same realization of the process. (See Section 2.3, Al-
gorithm 1 for a precise statement of the algorithm.) Therefore, the main
theoretical question that we consider is bootstrap consistency of our esti-
mator of the generalization error η∗( ˆft). By this, we mean showing that the
centered, normalized bootstrap process,

where E∗ [·] denotes expectation with respect to the bootstrap measure, and
the precise deﬁnition of (cid:98)η( ˆft) is postponed to Section 3.1.

Our results focus on models ˆft whose estimators are expressible as plug-
in estimators of some d-dimensional marginal distribution of the stochastic

3

process Y . In this framework, we can also view the generalization error itself
as a functional of distribution functions, enabling the use of weak conver-
gence results from empirical process theory. In contrast to the constraints
on the model and its estimator, essentially the only limit we put on the data
source Y is that it has to be mixing (i.e., all correlations must decay) at a
polynomial rate. In particular, we do not assume that the model is in any
way well-speciﬁed. An important part of our proof is establishing suﬃcient
conditions for the asymptotic independence of empirical processes formed
by splitting one realization of a stochastic process. This was implications
beyond the current problem, e.g., it allows us to show the asymptotic Gaus-
sianity and consistency of k-fold cross-validation for the risk with dependent
data (Appendix B).

We show (Section 3.3) that our conditions on the model hold for linear
autoregressive (AR(d)) models estimated by least squares — again, whether
or not the actual data-generating process is a linear autoregression. Simula-
tion studies (Section 4) indicate that convergence to the asymptotic coverage
levels is quite rapid, even when the model is highly mis-speciﬁed.

1.1. Related work.

If the data source were not just stationary but in-
dependent and identically distributed (IID), the deﬁnition of R( ˆft) would
(cid:105)
reduce to the usual E
, and we would be on familiar ground. If
we want a point estimate of the risk, we might adjust the in-sample per-
formance through the analytical approximations of the various information
criteria [11], or we might turn to computational procedures which attempt
to directly simulate extrapolating to new observations from the same dis-
tribution, such as cross-validation [5] or the bootstrap [16]2. If we want an
interval estimate, there are again abundant analytical results from statis-
tical learning theory, based on notions of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension,
Rademacher complexity, etc. [53, 38]. Many of these approaches, however,
require at the very least extensive re-thinking when applied to time series.
Thus, for example, while information criteria have been extensively stud-
ied for selecting the order of time series models (mostly AR and ARMA
models) since at least the work of Shibata [51], Hannan [20], it is well-
known that their penalty terms they add to the in-sample risk are only

2Bunke and Droge [9] compares the properties of cross-validation and a bootstrapped
generalization error, but in a theoretical study involving IID linear regression with Gaus-
sian errors. Shao [50] studies the theoretical properties of the bootstrapped generalization
error for model selection consistency in the linear regression, generalized linear regression,
and autoregressive model regimes. He considers a residual resampling scheme and shows
that this bootstrap is not consistent for model selection, but an m out of n variant of the
bootstrap is consistent.

accurate under correct model speciﬁcation [11]. Similarly, while forms of
cross-validation for time series exist [10, 21, 44, 45], we are unaware of work
which studies their properties under model mis-speciﬁcation. Both informa-
tion criteria and cross-validation moreover only provide point estimates of
the risk, rather than probabilistic bounds.

Extensive work has been done on extending the statistical-learning ap-
proach to deriving such “probably approximately correct” bounds to time
series [35, 24, 37, 36, 27, 34], but this strand of work has, from our point
of view, two drawbacks. The ﬁrst is that the bounds derived hold uniformly
over very wide ranges of processes. This is obviously advantageous when
one knows little about the data source, but means that the bounds are often
extremely conservative. The second drawback is that bounds often involve
diﬃcult-to-calculate quantities, especially the beta-mixing coeﬃcients which
quantify the decay of correlations in the stochastic process (see Deﬁnition
3.1). These are typically unknown, though not inestimable [33]. In contrast,
our bounds, while only asymptotically valid, are distribution-dependent and
fully calculable, though we do need to make a (weak) assumption about the
mixing coeﬃcients.

2. Proposed Estimator.

In this section, we describe our algorithm in
greater detail. We begin by discussing the resampling procedure, which will
be used to generate both the training and the test sets. The circular block
bootstrap variant that we will use can be found in Lahiri [28].

2.1. The Circular Block Bootstrap (CBB). Suppose the functional of in-
terest is a function of a d-dimensional distribution function. For each ob-
servation {1, . . . t}, generate a chunk given by Zi = (Yi, . . . , Yi+d−1). If an
index k exceeds t, change the value of the index to k mod t. By wrapping
the data around a circle, we ensure that each point is equally likely to be
resampled.3

To capture the dependence structure in the data, we will need to resample
contiguous blocks of the chunks, given by Bi = (Zi, . . . , Zi+(cid:96)−1), where (cid:96) is
the block-length. Suppose the desired resample size is N = t. Then we will
resample b = (cid:100)(N − d)/(cid:96)(cid:101) blocks, where the blocks are uniformly chosen
from {B1, . . . , Bt}. Let {s(1), . . . , s(b)} denote the indices corresponding to
the selected blocks. The result of the bootstrap procedure is the vector
given by (Bs(1), . . . , Bs(b)) = (Zs(1), Zs(1)+1, . . . , Zs(1)+(cid:96)−1, . . . Zs(b)+(cid:96)−1). If

3Had we ignored chunks with indices exceeding t, we would have had a moving-blocks
bootstrap, which has the undesirable property that the bootstrap expected value no longer
equals the sample mean.

the length exceeds N −d, truncate entries at the end of the vector as needed.
We can expand each Zi to form the (N − d) × d data matrix X∗ given by:

Note that it is also possible to perform a CBB procedure directly on Y1, . . . , Yt
to generate a bootstrapped series Y ∗
N , and then construct the boot-
strapped data matrix. This approach, however, suﬀers from the fact that
some rows in bootstrapped data matrix contain observations from two dif-
ferent blocks, leading to worse ﬁnite sample performance.

2.2. Computing the Generalization Error Bound. Our proposed proce-
dure is described in Algorithm 1, which follows McDonald [32, sec. 8.3].
Intuitively, we use the CBB to generate a training and test set. We then com-
pute an estimator of the generalization error, and take the (1 − α) quantile
of this estimator across all bootstrap iterations and use this to a construct
conﬁdence interval for the risk.

2.3. Choosing the Block Length. The theoretical results in the next sec-
tion are compatible with a range of block-length sequences, and so allow
for data-driven block-length selection. To our knowledge, there are no pro-
cedures in the literature that provide a consistent estimate of the optimal
block length for quantile estimation of a general Hadamard-diﬀerentiable
function. (The methods of Hall, Horowitz and Jing [19] and Lahiri, Fu-
rukawa and Lee [29] only apply to functionals in the “smooth function of
the mean” framework.) For convenience, we have used the procedure of Poli-

6

tis and White [42], which is optimized for the sample mean but performs
adequately in our simulation study4.

3. Main Results.

(cid:80)N

3.1. Preliminaries.

In this section, we will prove the main theorem, which
establishes suﬃcient conditions for bootstrap consistency of an estimator of
the generalization error to hold. Let (cid:101)RN ( ˆft) ≡ 1
i=t0+1 L(yi, ˆft) denote
t0
the test error. We will consider the case where N = 2t0. The sampling dis-
tribution that we would like to approximate with our bootstrap estimator
is that of (cid:98)η( ˆft) ≡ (cid:101)RN ( ˆft) − (cid:98)Rt( ˆft).

To derive limiting distributions, we will need assumptions about the de-
pendence structure. We will assume that the process has a β-mixing coeﬃ-
cient that decays at least at a cubic rate. While there are several equivalent
deﬁnitions of the β-mixing coeﬃcient, below we state the version we ﬁnd to
be most intuitive for strictly stationary processes.

Definition 3.1 (β-mixing coeﬃcient for stationary processes). Let Y
be a stationary stochastic process and (Ω, F, P∞) be the probability space
induced by the Kolmogorov extension. The coeﬃcient of absolute regularity,
or β-mixing coeﬃcient βY (k) is given by:

(7)

βY (k) = (cid:107)P−∞:0 ⊗ Pk:∞ − P−∞:0Pk:∞(cid:107)T V

where (cid:107)·(cid:107)T V is the total variation norm, P−∞:0⊗Pk:∞ is the joint distribution
of the blocks {Yi}0
i=k and P−∞:0Pk:∞ is the product measure
between the two blocks. We say that a process is β-mixing if βY (k) → 0.

i=−∞ and {Yi}∞

From the deﬁnition, we can see that βY → 0 implies asymptotic indepen-

dence as the gap between the past and future of the process grows.

We will also need to impose a diﬀerentiability condition on the estimated
parameters ˆθ(F ), which take as input a d-dimensional distribution function.
Since the input is an inﬁnite-dimensional object, we will need a generalized
notion of derivative. The notion we use is tangential Hadamard diﬀerentia-
bility, which we deﬁne below:

Definition 3.2 (Tangential Hadamard derivative). A map φ : Dφ ⊂
D (cid:55)→ E is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at θ ∈ D, tangential to a set D0 ⊂ D if

4In additional simulations, not shown here, we used block-lengths of the form Cn1/3
for a large grid of values of C. The procedure of Politis and White [42] was at least
comparable, in terms of coverage, to the best-in-retrospect C.

there exists a continuous linear map φ(cid:48)

(8)

φ(θ + tnhn) − φ(θ)
tn

→ φ(cid:48)
θ

as n → ∞ for all converging sequences tn → 0 and hn → h ∈ D0.

Finally, let (cid:96)∞(A, B) denote the space of bounded functions mapping from
A to B. If the second argument is omitted, take B to be R. Now we are ready
to state the main theorem.

Theorem 3.3. Let Y1, . . . , Yt be observations from a strictly stationary
β-mixing process Y supported on [−M, M ] for some M ∈ R. Suppose our
loss function can be expressed as L(z, θ) ∈ (cid:96)∞(Z × Θ, R), where z ∈ Z =
[−M, M ]d and θ ∈ Θ, where Θ is a subset of a normed space. Assume that
X ∗
train are generated by the CBB procedure described in Section 2
with the block size b(t) → ∞. Further, let ˆθ(·) : A ⊂ (cid:96)∞(Z, R) (cid:55)→ Θ, where
F ∈ A and θ0 = ˆθ(F ). Also assume the following conditions:

test and X ∗

k=1(k + 1)2βY (k) < ∞
2 b(t) < ∞

C1 (cid:80)∞
C2 lim supt→∞ t− 1
C3 L(·, θ) is appropriately tangentially Hadamard diﬀerentiable with re-
spect to θ at θ0 and L(z, θ0) is diﬀerentiable with respect to z with
bounded mixed partial derivatives up to the dth order on Z
C4 ˆθ(F ) is appropriately tangentially Hadamard diﬀerentiable at F

Then, the bootstrap is consistent for η∗( ˆf ∗

t ).

3.2. Proof of Main Theorem. We will show bootstrap consistency using
the functional delta method for the bootstrap. We will deﬁne additional
notions needed to state this theorem below. The deﬁnitions we adopt here
can be found in Kosorok [25].

Bootstrap consistency is known to follow from a certain conditional weak
convergence, which we will deﬁne below. For ease of exposition, we do not
address measurability issues in our deﬁnitions; again, the reader is referred
to van der Vaart and Wellner [52] or Kosorok [25] for details.

As discussed in Lahiri [28], we will construct chunks of size d such that
Zi = (Yi, . . . , Yi+d+1) and consider functionals of the distribution function of
Z. Let t0 = t − d + 1. In addition, let Pt = 1
i=1 δZi denote the empirical
t0
(cid:80)N
measure for the training data and PN = 1
i=t0+1 δZi denote the empirical
t0
measure for the test data, where N = 2t0. Similarly, let P ∗
N denote
the bootstrap measure for the training set and the test set, respectively,
where each measure is conditioned on t points.

For z ∈ Z, let the ≤ operator be deﬁned element-wise: that is, a ≤ b iﬀ

ai ≤ bi for all i ∈ {1, . . . , d}. If we let F be the function class given by:

(9)

F = {fs : s ∈ Z, fs(z) = 1(z ≤ s)}

It follows that the empirical distribution function for the training set and
test set can be expressed point-wise as Ft(s) = Ptfs and FN (s) = PN fs, re-
spectively. Analogous expressions hold for bootstrap measures. To represent
the entire distribution function, we can view Ft(·) and FN (·) as elements of
N (·) as elements of (cid:96)∞(Ω × ¯Ω × F, R), where
(cid:96)∞(Ω × F, R) and F ∗
¯Ω is the probability space associated with the bootstrap weights. For a ﬁxed
sample path, we may view these mappings as belonging to (cid:96)∞(F, R).

t (·) and F ∗

Our ﬁrst step is to translate ˆR( ˆft) and (cid:101)RN ( ˆft) into plug-in estimators.

This is done in the following lemma:

Lemma 3.6. Let A, B ∈ (cid:96)∞(F, R) and deﬁne the mappings:

(10)

(11)

(12)

φtrain(A, B) =

φtest(A, B) =

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

L(z, ˆθ(A)) dA

L(z, ˆθ(A)) dB

L(z, ˆθ(A)) dF

Then, ˆR( ˆft) and (cid:101)RN,( ˆft) are plug-in estimators for φtrain(·, ·) and φtest(·, ·),
respectively. Furthermore, suppose that Y is a stationary β-mixing pro-

9

cess satisfying (cid:80)∞
(Yt, . . . Yt−d) such that L(Yt+1, ˆft) = L(z, θ(Ft)). Then for each t ∈ N:

k=1 βY (k) < ∞ and ˆft is a function of θ(Ft) and zt =

L(z, ˆθ(Ft))dF = φrisk,F (Ft)

Proof of Lemma. The fact that the training and test errors are plug-in es-
timators of functionals given in (10) and (11) follows immediately by inspec-
tion. To see (13), consider the measurable space (Ωt+d, At+d), where super-
scripts denote product spaces, and let {µm}m∈N be a sequence of probability
measures corresponding to the distribution of (Y1, . . . , Yt, Yt+m, Yt+m+d−1).
By the deﬁnition of βY (·), it follows that:

(14)

(cid:107)µm − µ∞(cid:107)T V ≤ βY (m)

where µ∞ is the product measure between (Y1, . . . Yt) and (Yt+1, . . . Yt+d−1).
Now we will use a result from Schervish and Seidenfeld [48], stated in a less
general form for current purposes:

Lemma 3.7 (Schervish and Seidenfeld [48]). Let Q and R be probability
distributions on (Ωj, Aj) where j is allowed to be ∞. Deﬁne the space of
histories (Ht, Ht), where Ht = Ωt and Ht = At and let ht ∈ Ht be a history.
Suppose Q and R permit regular conditional probabilities, denoted Q(·|ht)
and R(·|ht), respectively. Then,

(15)

(cid:107)Q − R(cid:107)T V < ab =⇒ Q((cid:107)Q(·|ht) − R(·|ht)(cid:107)T V > a) < b

Applying this lemma with the assumed mixing conditions yields:

(16)

∞
(cid:88)

m=1

P∞ ((cid:107)µm(·|ht) − µ∞(·|ht)(cid:107)T V > am) < ∞

where P∞ is the distribution of the process Y and am → 0 5, which implies
that (cid:107)(µm(·|ht)−µ∞(·|ht)(cid:107)T V → 0, P∞−a.s. by Borel-Cantelli Lemma. Now,
we will use the fact that for all bounded f , (cid:107)(µm(·|ht) − µ∞(·|ht)(cid:107)T V → 0
implies that:

(17)

(cid:90)

f dµm(·|ht) →

(cid:90)

f dµ∞(·|ht)

5The fact that such an am exists can be shown using the Open Mapping Theorem in

functional analysis. See for example, Driver [14, Problem 25.23].

10

Applying this result to L(z, θ),which we assumed to be bounded, we conclude
= (cid:82) L(z, θ(Ft)dF P∞−a.s., which
that limm→∞ E
(cid:3)
implies that the Cesaro mean also converges to the desired limit.

(cid:104)
L(Zt+m, ˆθ(Ft)|Y1, . . . Yt)

(cid:105)

Remark 1. Going back to at least Akaike [2], a proposal for risk in the
time series setting is (cid:82) L(z, θ(Ft)dF , where Z and Y1, . . . Yt are observations
from diﬀerent runs of the process (and are therefore independent). While
easier to work with than many proposals for the conditional risk, it suﬀers
from the fact that we are often interested in how our model will perform on
future data from the same realization of the process. Our result here provides
suﬃcient conditions for which this convenient notion of risk is equivalent to
that of Shalizi and Kontorovich [49].

Remark 2. Summability of β-mixing coeﬃcients ensures convergence
of the shifted risk to the desired limit, which is stronger than what would
be minimally needed to show Cesaro convergence. One could make a similar
argument based on a uniform bound on the decay of correlations in Cesaro-
mean, but β-mixing is used in the main theorem, so we will not introduce
nonstandard notions of dependence here.

Now deﬁne Ht, H∗

t ∈ (cid:96)∞(F, R2), which represent centered bivariate em-
pirical processes related to the empirical distribution functions and boot-
strapped empirical distribution function, respectively:

the covariance function. We will derive the limiting distribution of Ht in the

Proof of Lemma. We will prove joint convergence using the following result
from the literature:

Proposition 3.9 (van der Vaart and Wellner [52], 1.5.3). Let Xα :
Ωα (cid:55)→ (cid:96)∞(U ) and Yα : Ωα (cid:55)→ (cid:96)∞(V ) be asymptotically tight nets such that

(22)
(Xα(u1), . . . Xα(uk), Yα(v1), . . . , Yα(vl)) (cid:32) (X(u1), . . . X(uk), Y (v1), . . . , Y (vl))

for stochastic processes X and Y . Then there exists versions of X and Y
with bounded sample paths and (Xα, Yα) (cid:32) (X, Y ) in (cid:96)∞(U ) × (cid:96)∞(V ).

That is, to show weak convergence of a vector-valued stochastic process, it
suﬃces to show (a) marginal asymptotic tightness and (b) ﬁnite-dimensional
convergence of arbitrary joint distributions. We will set U = V = F, where
F is the function class corresponding to indicator functions deﬁned in (9).
To show (a), it is suﬃcient to prove that there exists a semimetric ρ for
which U is totally bounded and

Proposition 3.10 (Kosorok [25], Theorem 11.25, after Arcones and Yu
[4], Theorem 2.1). Let Y be a stationary sequence in a Polish space with
marginal distribution P, and let F be a class of functions in L2(P ). Let
Gn(f ) = Pnf − P f . Suppose there exists a 2 < p < ∞ such that:

(a) limk→∞ k2/(p−2)(log k)2(p−1)/(p−2)βY (k) = 0
(b) F is permissible, VC and has envelope F satisfying P outF p < ∞.

Then Gn (cid:32) G in (cid:96)∞(F), where G is a mean 0 Gaussian Process with
covariance structure given in (21).

12

We can apply the result to each process marginally to show that (a) holds.

See Appendix A.2 for additional details.

To show (b), we will use the Cramer-Wold device. We will need a cen-
tral limit theorem for nonstationary triangular arrays satisfying some mixing
condition to show univariate convergence. To this end, we will state a modiﬁ-
cation of a theorem of Ekstrom [17]6, itself a modiﬁcation of Politis, Romano
and Wolf [41], which requires a slightly diﬀerent notion of mixing:

Definition 3.11 (α-mixing coeﬃcient).

(24)

αX (k) = sup

It is a well-known result in mixing theory that αX ≤ βX [8, Eq. 1.1].

Proposition 3.12 (Ekstrom [17], Theorem 1). Let {Xn,i, 1 ≤ i ≤ dn}
be a triangular array of random variables, with αn(·) being the α-mixing
coeﬃcients for the nth row, and ¯Xn ≡ d−1
i=1 Xn,i being the sample mean
n
of that row. Assume the following. For some δ > 0,

Let {u1, . . . , uk, v1, . . . , vl} be a set of arbitrary elements of Z for any

applying Cramer-Wold, we are left with the following sample mean:

We will view {gi(Zi)}dt
i=1 as elements of the triangular array. B1 follows for
our class F. Although the process is now nonstationary, it still satisﬁes B2
since the mixing coeﬃcient of {gi(Zi)}dn
i=1 is bounded by αY (·). Since we can
take δ to be arbitrarily large and αY (·) ≤ βY (·), (b) follows.

6This paper uses the notion of weakly-approaching random variables [7], which does
not require the existence of a limiting distribution; this is more general than what we need
here.

Now we will need to check that the limiting variance matches that of

limiting Gaussian process deﬁned in (21). Simple calculation reveals that:

The desired result will follow if we can show that the last two terms on the
RHS goes to 0. We ﬁnd conditions for this to be true below.

Lemma 3.13. Suppose Y is a stationary stochastic process that is poly-
nomially β-mixing and let G be the linear hull of F. That is, G is the function
class corresponding to ﬁnite linear combinations of F, given by:

(29)

|Cov(X, Y )| ≤ 10β(σ(X), σ(Y ))r(cid:107)X(cid:107)p(cid:107)Y (cid:107)q

where r + 1/p + 1/q = 1. For any g ∈ G, (cid:107)g(cid:107)∞ ≤ (cid:80)m
i=1 |ai|. We can therefore
set r = 1 − (cid:15) for an arbitrarily small (cid:15) > 0. Letting k = |i − j| and applying
the above inequality, we see that:

Since we have shown both (a) and (b), we have the joint convergence of
the empirical process deﬁned in (18) to a tight element in (cid:96)∞(F) × (cid:96)∞(F).
Furthermore, since each of the ﬁnite dimensional distributions are Gaussian,
the limiting process is Gaussian. Asymptotic independence of the marginal
Gaussian processes follows from asymptotic independence of ﬁnite dimen-
(cid:3)
sional distributions; see Kallenberg [23, Lemma 11.1].

Remark 3. When the stochastic process is compactly supported, this
result holds for an arbitrary permissible VC class. In a more general setting,
there is a trade-oﬀ between assumptions on moments and mixing rates.

Remark 4. For d-dimensional distribution functions, this lemma holds

under α-mixing due to a result of Rio [47, Theorem 7.3].

Now, ﬁnite VC dimension, along with the assumed mixing conditions,

allows us to invoke the following theorem due to Radulovi´c [46]:

Proposition 3.14 (Kosorok [25], Theorem 11.26, after Radulovi´c [46],
Theorem 1). Let Y be a stationary sequence taking values in Rd for some
d ∈ N with marginal distribution P , and let F be a class of functions in
L2(P ). Let G∗

n are generated
by the CBB procedure with block size b(n) → ∞ as n → ∞, and that there

Since F is permissible, by Yu [54] the measurability criteria are satisﬁed.
Finally, the functional delta method requires tangential Hadamard diﬀer-
entiability of φtest(A, B) − φtrain(A, B) at our limit point (F,F). Note that
φtest(·) can be expressed as the following composition of mappings:

(31)

(b)

(c)

Due to the Chain Rule, which we will state below, it will suﬃce to establish
tangential Hadamard diﬀerentiability for each of the intermediate mappings.

Proposition 3.15 (Chain Rule, van der Vaart and Wellner [52], Lemma
If φ : Dφ ⊂ D (cid:55)→ Eφ is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at θ ∈ Dψ tangen-
3.9.3).
tially to D0 and ψ : Eψ (cid:55)→ F is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at φ(θ) tangentially
θ(D0), then ψ ◦ φ : Dφ (cid:55)→ F is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at θ tangentially
to φ(cid:48)
to D0 with derivative ψ(cid:48)

φ(θ) ◦ φ(cid:48)
θ.

Diﬀerentiability of (a) follows from C4, (b) from C3, and (c) follows from
a multivariate generalization of the following proposition (see Appendix A.3
for details):

Proposition 3.16 (Integration, van der Vaart and Wellner [52], Lemma
3.9.17). Given a cadlag function A and a function of bounded variation B
on an interval [a, b] ∈ ¯R, deﬁne

(32)

φ(A, B) =

Then, φ : D[a, b] × BVM [a, b]
(A, B) ∈ Dφ such that (cid:82) |dA| < ∞. The derivative is given by:

(cid:55)→ R is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at each

φ(cid:48)
A,B(α, β) =

Condition C3 is stronger than what is needed to establish Hadamard
diﬀerentiability for step (b), but ensures that the derivative is well-deﬁned.
See Appendix A.3 for details.

Similar reasoning holds for φtrain(·) and Hadamard diﬀerentiability of
the diﬀerence holds due to the fact that the derivative is a linear operator.
Then by the Functional Delta Method for the bootstrap, the bootstrap is
consistent for η∗( ˆft).

Remark 5. Adding an estimate of the 1 − α quantile of the generaliza-
tion error to the training error is not the only way to construct conﬁdence
intervals. In particular, one could also bootstrap the test error.

3.3. Application of main theorem to AR(p) models under weak assump-
tions. The motivating example for this theorem is the setting in which
we use an AR(p) model to predict a stationary β-mixing process. We will
state a corollary of our theorem that establishes bootstrap consistency of
our procedure in this setting under squared error loss.

16

Corollary 3.17. Let Y be a compactly-supported stationary stochas-
tic process satisfying the mixing condition C1 and Θ be a compact subset of
Rp for some p ∈ N. Suppose L(z, θ) = [zT (−θ, 1)]2, where ˆθ(F ) is the least
square estimator for an AR(p) model. Further suppose that b(n) satisﬁes
C2. Then the bootstrap is consistent for η∗( ˆf ∗

t ).

Proof. We will start by establishing C3, appropriate tangential Hadamard
diﬀerentiability of L : Θ (cid:55)→ (cid:96)∞(Z, R) at θ0. For notational convenience, let
z = (x, y), where y = yd and x = (y1, . . . yd−1). We will establish the required
tangential Hadamard diﬀerentiability by showing that:

(34)

where:

→ 0

θ0((x, y), h) = 2(y − θT
L(cid:48)

0 x)hT x

The expression on the LHS of (34) may be rewritten as:

(36)

(cid:13)2(y − xT θ0)xT (hn − h)(cid:13)
(cid:13)

(cid:13)∞ + |tn| · (cid:13)

(cid:13)(xT hn)2(cid:13)
(cid:13)∞

For the ﬁrst term in (36), there exists C < ∞ such that for all hn:

(37)

max
x,y

|2(y − xT θ0)xT (hn − h)| < C||hn − h||1

Since ||hn − h||∞ → 0, this term goes to 0. Since maxx(xT hn)2 → M 2||h||2
1
and tn → 0, the second term also converges to 0, and Hadamard diﬀerentia-
bility at θ0 follows.

The only condition that remains to be checked is C4, the tangential

Hadamard diﬀerentiability of the least squares estimator.

We will start by introducing some notation. Given a subset Θ of a Banach
space and another Banach space L, let (cid:96)∞(Θ, L) be the Banach space of uni-
formly bounded functions z : Θ (cid:55)→ L. Let Z(Θ, L) be the subset consisting of
all maps with at least one zero. Let φ : Z(Θ, L) (cid:55)→ Θ be a map that assigns
one of its zeros to each element z ∈ Z(θ, L). In the squared error case, Θ
represents the domain of the coeﬃcients and L represents the codomain of
the estimating equations. Further let lin Θ denote the linear closure of Θ.
Hadamard diﬀerentiability is established by the following:

Proposition 3.18 (Z-Estimators, van der Vaart and Wellner [52], Lemma
3.9.34). Assume Φ : Θ (cid:55)→ L is uniformly norm-bounded, is one-to-one,

17

possesses a θ0 and has an inverse (with domain Φ(Θ)) that is continuous
at 0. Let Φ be Frechet diﬀerentiable at θ0 with derivative ˙Φ, which is one-
to-one and continuously invertible on lin Θ. Then the map φ : Z(Θ, L) ⊂
(cid:96)∞(Θ, L) (cid:55)→ Θ is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at Φ tangentially to the set of
z ∈ (cid:96)∞(Θ, L) that are continuous at θ0. The derivative is given by φΦ(z) =
− ˙Φ−1
θ0

(z(θ0)).

This result establishes Hadamard diﬀerentiability of the least squares esti-
mator as a function of Φ(·). We can view Φn(·) as a Hadamard diﬀerentiable
mapping of distribution functions to complete the proof. We will show this
last step in the proposition below:

Proposition 3.19. Let Υ : A ⊂ (cid:96)∞(Z, R) (cid:55)→ (cid:96)∞(Θ, Rd−1), be the least
squares estimator with d − 1 parameters, where A is a subset in which
integration is well-deﬁned. Let the jth coordinate of Υ(θ, A) be given by:

(38)

Υj(θ, A) = −2

(cid:90)

yt−j+1(yt − θ1yt−1 − . . . − θd−1yt−d+1)dA ≡

(cid:90)

υj(z, θ)dA

Then, Υ(·, A) is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at a distribution function F , tan-
gentially to C([−M, M ]d)7, with derivative of the jth coordinate given by:
(cid:90)

(39)

˙ΥF,j(·, h) =

υj(z, ·)dh

Proof. Since the codomain is ﬁnite-dimensional, it suﬃces to establish
Hadamard diﬀerentiability for each coordinate. Since the estimating equa-
tions are symmetric, we can further restrict our attention to one coordinate.
First for ||hn − h||∞ → 0 and tn → 0, point-wise in θ, notice that:

(40)
(cid:82) υj(z, θ)d(F + tnhn) − (cid:82) υj(z, θ)dF

(cid:82) υj(z, θ)d(F − F )

υj(z, θ)dh

Next, since Θ is compact, (cid:82) υj(z, ·)dhn is convex (aﬃne), point-wise conver-
gence implies uniform convergence [22, Thm 3.1.4]. Therefore,

(42)

7Since υj(z, θ) has bounded variation in the Hardy-Krause sense, this tangent set is
suﬃcient for well-deﬁnition of the integral by an integration by parts argument. For details,
see Remark 6.

18

and Hadamard diﬀerentiability of Υ(·, A) at F follows.

See Appendix A.3 for additional details regarding the multivariate stochas-
tic integration that results from applying the Functional Delta Method. In
particular, Remark 6 provides an additional suﬃcient condition on the loss
function that ensures that the pathwise Riemann-Stieltjes integral exists a.s.
This condition is satisﬁed for squared error loss.

4. Simulation Study. To demonstrate the performance of our method
in a non-asymptotic setting, we examine three simulated examples. In each
example, we will use squared error loss, an AR(ρ) model for prediction,
and data generating process satisfying the mixing conditions imposed in our
theorem. Note that here we consider distributions with unbounded support;
our procedure seems to work with the distributions considered supported on
entire real line.

4.1. ARMA(p, q) DGP. Suppose that the data generating process is of

the form:

(43)

Xt =

p
(cid:88)

i=1

ϕiXt−i +

q
(cid:88)

j=1

θj(cid:15)t−j + (cid:15)t

where the coeﬃcients satisfy stationarity and {(cid:15)j}j∈Z is an iid sequence
such that E((cid:15)j) = 0 and the distribution of (cid:15)j is dominated by the Lebesgue
measure. Then Doukhan [13] establishes that Xt is geometrically β-mixing.
We will simulate from an ARMA(2,2) process, with coeﬃcients ϕ1 = 0.5,
ϕ2 = 0.5, θ1 = 0.5, and θ2 = 0.25 with (cid:15)i ∼ N (0, 1). We will use an AR(1)
model for prediction.

4.2. AR-ARCH DGP. We will consider an AR data generating process

with heteroscedastic ARCH noise. That is, consider:

p
(cid:88)

Xt =

ϕiXt−i + (cid:15)t

i=1
(cid:112)

(cid:15)t =

htzt
r
(cid:88)

ht = ω +

αj(cid:15)2

t−j

j=1

where zt is an iid noise sequence. More speciﬁcally, Lange, Rahbek and
Jensen [30] show that an AR(1)-ARCH(1) model satisfying E(log(α1z2
t )) < 0
and |ϕ1| < 1 is stationary and geometrically β-mixing.

19

In our simulation, we will set ϕ1 = 0.8, α1 = 0.99, and zt ∼ N (0, 1). Note
that our choice of α1 leads to a high but ﬁnite variance. We will use an
AR(3) model for prediction.

4.3. Markov-switching DGP. Breaks in the data are commonly modeled
as a switch from one stationary generating process to another, where the
regime switch is determined by a Markov Chain. Here, we consider a data
generating process that switches between a ﬁnite number of ARMA(p, q)
models. In particular, we will follow the example used by Lee [31]:

yt =






1.5yt−1 + 0.6et−1 + et X = 1
0.9yt−1 − 1.2et−1 + et X = 2
X = 3
0.7et−1

with transition matrix P given by





0
0.7
0.5





0.2 0.8
0.3
0
0.5
0

If et is iid and E|et|5 < ∞, then yt is geometrically ergodic and since it is a
stationary Markov Chain, it is also geometrically β-mixing. We will simulate
using et ∼ N (0, 1) and an AR(2) model for prediction.

4.4. Coverage of proposed bootstrap procedure. We summarize the be-
havior of our estimator in Figure 1. For all data generating processes, we
examine 11 sample sizes, ranging from 50 to 1000, and select a block length
using Politis and White [42]. We simulate a time series of length 1000 to
estimate the risk. We consider 500 bootstrap replications and generate 500
diﬀerent bootstrap conﬁdence intervals based on diﬀerent runs of the data
generating process to calculate coverage.

For the AR(2,2) data generating process, we see that the bootstrap conﬁ-
dence intervals have coverage close to desired α-level even for sample sizes as
small as 25. Both the AR-ARCH(1) and Markov-switching data generating
processes exhibit poor coverage for small sample sizes but reach the desired
coverage level by 1000 observations.

5. Discussion. We propose a method based on the block bootstrap
for constructing conﬁdence intervals for the risk. We succeed in showing
bootstrap consistency with minimal assumptions on the data generating
process itself. However, it may seem that assumptions about mixing rates

20

Fig 1: Coverage of Bootstrapped Generalization Error Bounds

may be hard to verify. While we do not disagree with this sentiment entirely,
the β-mixing coeﬃcient is in principle estimable [34], and the cubic mixing
rate condition is satisﬁed for both m-dependent and geometrically ergodic
Markov Chains [8].

While we have not dealt directly with model selection, our work opens
up possibilities for that topic. The diﬀerence of two risk functionals satis-
fying the conditions of our theorem would also be Hadamard diﬀerentiable,
allowing for model selection, at least in the ﬁxed-d setting. Our approach
could not distinguish between models with the same asymptotic risk, but
this is not a major concern if one presumes all models are mis-speciﬁed. The
limitation to ﬁxed d may be more of an issue, and this is one more reason
to studying the growing-memory regime.

Another topic of future research is showing the viability of our procedure
for a wider range of models. Showing Hadamard diﬀerentiability of more
complicated functionals may prove diﬃcult, but Hable [18] for instance is a
promising step in this direction. In these cases, more conditions on the data
generating process may be needed, which may be a price worth paying to
prove guarantees for other models commonly used in data analysis.

dro Rinaldo and Valerie Ventura for helpful discussions. We wish to record

posed in [32].

APPENDIX A: PROOF MODIFICATIONS

At several points, we invoke propositions which are slight extensions or
modiﬁcations of ones established in the prior literature. In the interest of
completeness, this appendix indicates how the published proofs need to be
adjusted.

A.1. Proposition 3.14, after Radulovi´c [46, Theorem 1]. Let zi =
(yi, . . . yi+d−1). By resampling these blocks of blocks, we arrive at the CBB
discussed in Section 2.3. After applying an f ∈ F to the zi’s, we are again
back to the case of real-valued functions, and the rest of the argument carries
through.

A.2. Proposition 3.10, after Arcones and Yu [4, Lemma 2.1].

Here, we need to conﬁrm that the process {
satisﬁes the stochastic equicontinuity condition, deﬁned in (23). We will show
this by making a small modiﬁcation in Lemma 2.1, equation (2.14). Permis-
sibility implies that (cid:107) · (cid:107)F is measurable; therefore the following holds due
to strict stationarity:

t0(1/t0

i=t0+1 f (Xi)−E [f (X)]}F

i=1

At each t, the bound is the same as that of the process starting at i = 1.

A.3. Proposition 3.16, after van der Vaart and Wellner [52,
Lemma 3.9.17]. The proof of van der Vaart and Wellner [52] general-
izes to the multivariate case if we consider a rectangular support region
R ≡ (cid:81)d
i=1[ai, bi] ⊂ Rd. In the ensuing discussion of Lebesgue-Stieltjes and
Riemann-Stieltjes integrals of the form (cid:82) f dg, we will refer to f as the in-
tegrand and g as the integrator. Lebesgue-Stieltjes integration requires that
the function in the integrand has bounded variation over the interval [a, b].
In the univariate case, this means that:

(46)

sup
Y∈Y

(cid:88)

y∈Y

|f (y+) − f (y)| < ∞

where Y is a ladder on [a, b], consisting of ﬁnitely many values from this
interval. Suppose for a given ladder, we arrange each of the points in in-
creasing order: y0 < y1, . . . < ym. The successor of a particular y, denoted

22

as y+, is deﬁned as the next element in the sequence. The supremum is over
all such ladders.

A multivariate extension of Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals requires a gener-
alization of this notion of bounded variation. More than one such generaliza-
tion is possible; below we will discuss variation in the Hardy-Krause sense,
which will also require that we deﬁne variation in the Vitali sense.

We will start by introducing relevant concepts. We will largely follow the
notation in Owen [39]. Let [a, b] be a hyperrectangle in Rd. Suppose that
u, v ⊂ {1, . . . , d} and x, z ∈ [a, b] and u ∩ v = ∅. Take xu : zv to be the
concatenation, resulting in a vector with values equal to x for i ∈ u and
equal to z for i ∈ v. Let −v represent the complement of v. Take the d-fold
alternating sum over [a, b] to be

(47)

∆(f ; a, b) =

(cid:88)

(−1)|v|f (av : b−v)

v⊂{1,...,d}

Now let Y = (cid:81)d
The variation of f over Y is:

j=1 Y j, where Y j is a univariate ladder for the jth coordinate.

(48)

VY (f ) =

(cid:88)

y∈Y

|∆(f, y, y+)|

By again taking the supremum of the variation over all possible ladders we
arrive at the Vitali notion of variation:

Definition A.3.1. The variation of f on the hyperrectangle [a, b] in the

sense of Vitali, is:

(49)

VV(f ) = sup
Y∈Y

VY (f )

The Hardy-Krause notion of variation is closely related to that of Vitali
deﬁned above. It consists of restricting the function to take the value of bi for
each subset of the coordinates and summing the resulting Vitali variations.

Definition A.3.2. The variation of f on the hyperrectangle [a, b] in the

sense of Hardy and Krause is

(50)

VHK(f ) =

(cid:88)

VV(f (xu : b−u))

u⊂{1,...,d},u(cid:54)=∅

Variation in the Hardy-Krause sense is generally larger than in the Vitali
sense; in fact, one can construct examples such that the former is inﬁnite
while the latter is ﬁnite. See for example, Beare [6].

23

In the univariate case, bounded variation implies the existence of the Jor-
dan decomposition, where the integrator is expressed as the diﬀerence of two
monotonic functions. Then, one can use the Caratheodory extension theo-
rem to uniquely match each Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure with an appropriate
Lebesgue measure. An analogous result holds in the multivariate case if the
integrator is of bounded variation in the Hardy-Krause sense, making it a
natural condition to impose in our proof modiﬁcation.

Proposition A.3.3. Given a continuous function A and a function of
bounded variation B in the sense of Hardy-Krause in the hyperrectangle
R ≡ (cid:81)d

i=1[ai, bi], deﬁne

(51)

φ(A, B) =

(cid:90)

A dB

Then, φ : C(R)×BVM (R) (cid:55)→ R is Hadamard diﬀerentiable at each (A, B) ∈
Dφ such that (cid:82) |dA| < ∞. The derivative is given by:

(52)

φ(cid:48)
A,B(α, β) =

(cid:90)

A dβ +

(cid:90)

α dB

Proof. For αt → α and βt → β, deﬁne At = A + tαt and Bt = B + tβt.

Write:

(53)
(cid:82) AtdBt − (cid:82) AdB
t

− φ(cid:48)

A,B(αt, βt) =

(cid:90)

αd(Bt − B) +

(cid:90)

(αt − α)d(Bt − B)

Analogous to van der Vaart and Wellner [52], the second term on the RHS
can be bounded by 2C(cid:107)αt − α(cid:107)∞ → 0 for some C < ∞. See Aistleitner and
Dick [1] for the relationship between the total variation in the Hardy-Krause
sense and variation of the signed measure.

For the ﬁrst term, we again make an identical argument. Since α is con-
tinuous we can construct a d-dimensional grid such that α varies no more
than (cid:15) within a particular grid. Let (cid:101)α be the discretization that is constant
and takes the value α(y) where y is the left endpoint of the grid. Then,

(cid:12)
(cid:90)

24

where a coordinate is ﬁxed at bi when there is no successor y+
i . The ﬁrst
item on the RHS can be made arbitrarily small by making (cid:15) small, and the
last term is bounded by |Ygrid| · (cid:107)α(cid:107)∞
i=1 |bi − ai| · (cid:107)Bt − B(cid:107)∞, which can
be made arbitrarily small for a ﬁxed partition.

(cid:81)d

Remark 6. Evaluating the Hadamard derivative after applying the Func-
tional Delta Method results in integration with respect to a Gaussian pro-
cess. This leads to some issues as even the canonical empirical process
G = limt→∞
t(Ft − F ) is known to have unbounded variation in the iid
one-dimensional case for general P even though it is uniformly continuous;
see Dudley [15].

√

We can follow van der Vaart and Wellner [52] and deﬁne the integral via an
integration by parts formula. Since tight Gaussian processes are continuous
a.s., it is enough to require that the integrand is of bounded variation in
the Hardy-Krause sense for the pathwise Riemann-Stieltjes integral to exist
a.s. A simple condition to ensure bounded variation is that the integrand is
diﬀerentiable with bounded mixed partial derivatives [39, Prop. 13].

Lebesgue-Stieltjes integration is often thought of as a generalization of
Riemann-Stieltjes integration. This is indeed the case when the integrator
has bounded variation. Riemann-Stieltjes integration requires that the inte-
grand and integrator share no points of discontinuity, whereas discontinuities
are not an issue when the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral is transformed into a
Lebesgue integral.

However, an integration by parts formula for Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals
generally requires both functions to be of bounded variation since the strat-
egy is to replace the integrand with a corresponding measure and use the
Fubini-Tonelli Theorem. A Riemann-Stieltjes integral can be shown to exist
when one side of the integration by parts formula exists, which does not
require both functions to be of bounded variation [43].

Note that in the main theorem, we will ﬁx θ for L(z, θ) in this step in the

Chain Rule.

APPENDIX B: IMPLICATIONS FOR K-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION

B.1. Functional Representation of K-fold Cross-Validation. Here
we show that K-fold cross-validation can also be expressed as a functional
of distribution functions. Let Ft,i correspond to the empirical distribution
function of the ith fold at time t. We will ignore the issue of fold membership
when t is not divisible by k since this is irrelevant in the triangular array

setting. A simple extension of Lemma 3.8 implies that:

where Hk is the kth product of G, the limiting Gaussian process with covari-
ance function given in (21). Since we have weak convergence, we can apply
the Functional Delta Method to show asymptotic Normality and consistency
of Cross Validation under nearly identical conditions to the main theorem:

Proposition B.1.1. Consider the Cross-Validated risk, deﬁned as:

We study the asymptotic Normality of the cross-validated risk using the
same data generating processes considered in Section 4 in the plots below.
For each process, we run 5-fold cross-validation using an AR(2) model for
prediction on a range of sample sizes. We examine asymptotic Normality
by simulating 10000 runs of the procedure and comparing the standardized
quantiles with those of a Normal distribution. In general, we see that the
Normal approximation is poor for relatively small sample sizes (n = 50, n =
100), with the quantiles exhibiting very heavy tails. However, with increasing
n, we see that the tails become better behaved.

To our knowledge, the only other result regarding the risk consistency of
Cross-Validation for time series is Racine [45], who considers autoregressive
models. Our result is more agnostic about the data generating process, but
could probably be extended using diﬀerent tools.
