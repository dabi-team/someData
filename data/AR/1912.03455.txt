Abstract

We present an approach to generate high ﬁdelity 3D face
avatar with a high-resolution UV texture map from a single
image. To estimate the face geometry, we use a deep neural
network to directly predict vertex coordinates of the 3D face
model from the given image. The 3D face geometry is fur-
ther reﬁned by a non-rigid deformation process to more ac-
curately capture facial landmarks before texture projection.
A key novelty of our approach is to train the shape regres-
sion network on facial images synthetically generated using
a high-quality rendering engine. Moreover, our shape esti-
mator fully leverages the discriminative power of deep fa-
cial identity features learned from millions of facial images.
We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate
the superiority of our optimized 2D-to-3D rendering ap-
proach, especially its excellent generalization property on
real-world selﬁe images. Our proposed system of rendering
3D avatars from 2D images has a wide range of applica-
tions from virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and telepsy-
chiatry to human-computer interaction and social networks.

1. Introduction

Acquiring high quality 3D avatars is an essential task in
many vision applications including VR/AR, teleconferenc-
ing, virtual try-on, computer games, special effect, and so
on. A common practice, adopted by most professional pro-
duction studios, is to manually create avatars from 3D scans
or photo references by skillful artists. This process is often
time consuming and labor intensive because each model re-
quires days of manual processing and touching up.
It is
desirable to automate the process of 3D avatar generation
by leveraging rapid advances in computer vision/graphics

and image/geometry processing. There has been a ﬂurry of
works on generating 3D avatars from handheld video [19],
Kinect [1] and mesh model [45] in the open literature.

Developing a fully automatic system for generating 3D
avatar from a single image is challenging because the esti-
mation of both facial shape and texture map involves intrin-
sically ambiguous composition of light, shape and surface
material. Conventional wisdom attempts to address this is-
sue by inverse rendering, which formulates image decom-
position as an optimization problem and estimates the pa-
rameters best ﬁtting the observed image [4, 2, 31]. More
recently, several deep learning based approaches have been
proposed - either in a supervised setup to directly regress
the parameterized 3D face model [50, 11, 43] or in an un-

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
supervised fashion [39, 16, 32] with the help of a differen-
tiable rendering process. However, these existing methods
usually assume over-simpliﬁed lighting, shading and skin
surface models, which does not take real-world complex-
ities (e.g., sub-surface scattering, shadows caused by self-
occlusion and complicated skin reﬂectance ﬁeld [9]) into
account. Consequently, the recovered 3D avatar often does
not faithfully reﬂect the actual face presented in the image.
To meet those challenges, we propose a novel semi-
supervised approach to utilize synthetically-rendered,
photo-realistic facial images augmented from a prioritized
3D facial scan dataset. Upon collecting and processing 482
neutral facial scans with a medical grade 3D facial scan-
ner, we perform shape augmentation and utilize a high-
ﬁdelity rendering engine to create a large collection of
photo-realistic facial images. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the ﬁrst attempt to leverage photo-realistic fa-
cial image synthesis for accurate face shape inference.

For facial geometry estimation, we propose to ﬁrst ex-
tract deep facial identity features [37, 28], trained on mil-
lions of images, which encodes each face into a unique la-
tent representation, and regress the vertex coordinates of a
generic 3D head model. To better capture facial landmarks
for texture projection, the vertex coordinates are further re-
ﬁned in a non-rigid manner by jointly optimizing over cam-
era intrinsic, head pose, facial expression and a per-vertex
corrective ﬁeld. Our ﬁnal generated model consists of a
shape model with low polygon counts but a high-resolution
texture map with sharp details, which allows efﬁcient ren-
dering even on mobile devices (as shown in Fig. 1).

At the system level, 3D avatars created by our approach
are similar to those of Pinscreen [17, 48] and FaceSoft.io
[14]. For Pinscreen avatar,
the shape model is recon-
structed via an analysis-by-synthesis method [4]; while our
shape model is directly regressed from deep facial iden-
tity features, hence reaching higher shape similarity. For
FaceSoft.io avatar, both shape and texture models utilize
a collection of 10,000 facial scans [6]; while our semi-
supervised method only uses 482 scans and is still capa-
ble of achieving similar shape reconstruction accuracy and
higher resolution UV-texture map from an input selﬁe.

Our key contributions can be summarized as follows:
• A system for generating a high-ﬁdelity UV-textured 3D
avatar from a single image which can be efﬁciently rendered
in real time even on mobile devices.

• Training a shape estimator on the synthetic photo-
realistic images by using pre-trained deep facial identity
features. The trained networks demonstrate excellent gen-
eralization properties on real-world images.

• Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the
proposed method against other state-of-the-art face mod-
eling techniques demonstrates its superiority (i.e., higher
shape similarity and texture resolution).

3D Face Representation.

3D Morphable Model
(3DMM) [4] uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
aligned 3D neutral faces to reduce the dimension of 3D
face representation making the face ﬁtting problem more
tractable. The FaceWareHouse technique [8] enhances the
original PCA-based neutral face model with expressions by
applying multi-linear analysis [44] to a large collection of
4D facial scans captured with RGB-D sensors. The quality
of multi-linear model was further improved in [5] by jointly
optimizing the model and the group-wise registration of 3D
scans. In [6], a Large Scale Facial Model with 10,000 faces
was generated to maximize the coverage of gender and eth-
nics. The training data was further enlarged in [27], which
created a linear shape space trained from 4D scans of 3800
human heads. More recently, a non-linear model was pro-
posed in [41] from a large set of unconstrained face images
without the necessity of collecting 3D face scans.

Fitting via Inverse Rendering. Inverse rendering [2, 4]
formulates 3D face modeling as an optimization problem
over the entire parameter space seeking the best ﬁtting for
the observed image. In addition to pixel intensity values,
other constraints such as facial landmarks and edge con-
tours, are exploited for more accurate ﬁtting [31]. More re-
cently, GanFit [14] used a generative neural network for fa-
cial texture modeling and utilized an additional facial iden-
tity loss function in the optimization formulation. The in-
verse rendering based modeling approach has been widely
used in many applications [48, 18, 40, 15].

Supervised Shape Regression. Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based approaches have been proposed to
directly map an input image to the parameters of a 3D face
model such as 3DMM [10, 50, 22, 42, 49]. In [20], a volu-
metric representation was learned from an input image. In
[34], an input color image was mapped to a depth image
using an image translation network. In [11], a network was
proposed to jointly reconstruct the 3D facial structure and
provide dense alignment in the UV space. The work of [43]
took a layered approach toward decoupling low-frequency
geometry from its mid-level details estimated by a shape-
from-shading approach. It is worth mentioning that many
CNN-based approaches use facial shape estimated by in-
verse rendering as the ground truth during training.

Unsupervised Learning. Most recently, face modeling
from images via unsupervised learning becomes popular
because it affords almost unlimited amount of data for train-
ing. An image formation layer was introduced in [39] as the
decoder jointly working with an auto-encoder architecture
for end-to-end unsupervised training. SfSNet [35] explicitly
decomposes an input image into albedo, normal and light-
ing components, which are then composed back to approxi-
mate the original input image. 3DMM parameters were ﬁrst
directly learned in [16] from facial identity encoding and

then the problem of parameter optimization was formulated
in an unsupervised fashion by introducing a differentiable
renderer and a facial identity loss on the rendered facial im-
age. A multi-level face model, (i.e. 3DMM with corrective
ﬁeld) was developed in [38] following an inverse render-
ing setup that explicitly models geometry, reﬂectance and
illumination per vertex. RingNet [32] employed a similar
idea as the triplet loss for encoding all images of the same
subject to the same latent shape representation.

Deep Facial Identity Feature. Recent advances in face
recognition [37, 28, 33] attempt to encode all facial images
of the same subject under different conditions into identi-
cal feature representations, namely deep facial identity fea-
tures. Several attempts have been made to utilize this ro-
bust feature representation for face modeling. GanFit [14]
used an additional deep facial identity loss to the commonly
used landmark and pixel intensity losses. In [16], 3DMM
parameters were directly learned from deep facial features.
Although our shape regression network is similar to theirs,
the choice of training data is different. Unlike their unsu-
pervised setting, we opt to work with supervision by syn-
thetically rendered facial images.

3. Proposed Method

3.1. Overview

An overview of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 2.
To facilitate facial image synthesis (Sec. 3.2) for training a
shape regression neural network (Sec. 3.3), we have col-
lected and processed a prioritized 3D face dataset, from
which we can sample augmented 3D face shape with UV-
texture to render a large collection of photo-realistic facial
images. During testing, the input image is ﬁrst used to di-
rectly regress the 3D vertex coordinates of a 3D face model
with the given topology, which are furthered reﬁned to ﬁt
the input image with a per-vertex non-rigid deformation ap-
proach (Sec. 3.4). Upon accurate ﬁtting, selﬁe texture is
projected to the UV space to infer a complete texture map
(Sec. 3.5).

3.2. Photo-Realistic Facial Synthesis

3D Scan Database. The most widely used Basel Face
Model (BFM) [29] has two major drawbacks. First, it con-
sists of 200 subjects but mainly Caucasian, which might
lead to biased face shape estimation. Second, each face
is represented by a dense model with high polygon count,
per-vertex texture appearance and frontal face only, which
limits its use for production-level real-time rendering. To
overcome these limitations, we have collected a total of
512 subjects using a professional-grade multi-camera stereo
scanner (3dMD LLC, Atlanta 1) across different gender and
ethnicity as shown in Table 1.

group for testing and the rest subjects are used for training
and validation.

A face representation containing a head model of 2925
vertices and a diffuse map sized by 2048 × 2048 is used.
We take a non-rigid alignment approach [8] of deforming a
generic head model to match the captured facial scan. Then
we transfer the texture onto the generic model’s UV space.
With further manual artistic touch up, we obtain the ﬁnal
high-ﬁdelity diffuse map.

Shape Augmentation. 482 subjects are far from enough
to cover all possible facial shape variations. While it is ex-
pensive to collect thousands of high-quality facial scans, we
adopt an alternative shape augmentation approach to im-
prove the generalization ability of the trained neural net-
work. First, we adopt a recent deformation representation
(DR) [46, 13] to model a 3D facial mesh P. DR feature

encodes the ith vertex Pi = [P i
Hence the DR feature of the entire mesh is represented as a
vector D ∈ R|P|×9. Please see the supplementary material
on how to compute a DR feature D from P and vice versa.
Upon obtaining a set of DR features as (D1, ..., DN )
where N is the total number of subjects, we follow [21]
to sample new DR features. More speciﬁcally, we sam-
ple a vector (r, θ1, ..., θm1) in Polar coordinates, where
r observes a uniform distribution U[0.6, 1.3] and θi fol-
lows uniform distribution U[0, π/2]. We calculate its cor-
responding Cartesian coordinates (a1, a2, ..., am) and in-
terpolate the sampled DR features as (cid:80)m
i=1 aiDi, from
which we further calculate the corresponding facial mesh.
In our experiments, we use m = 5 and only select
samples from the same gender and ethnicity. We gener-
ate 10,000 new 3D faces with a ratio of 0.65/0.30/0.05
across Asian/Caucasian/Black and a ratio of 0.5/0.5 across
Male/Female. For each new sampled face, we assign its UV
texture by choosing that is the closest 3D face in the same
ethnicity and gender from existing 482 subjects.

Synthetic Rendering. We use an off-the-shelf high
quality rendering engine V-ray 2. With artistic assistance,
we set up a shader graph to render photo-realistic facial
images given a custom diffuse map and a generic specular
map. We manually set up 30 different lighting conditions

and further randomize head rotation [−15
yaw and pitch. The background of rendered images are ran-

domized with a large collection of indoor and outdoor im-
ages. We opt not to render eye models and mask out the eye
areas when testing by using detected local eye landmarks.
Please see supplementary material for more details.

3.3. Regressing Vertex Coordinates

Our shape regression network consists of a feature en-
coder and a shape decoder. Deep facial identity feature is
known for its robustness under varying conditions such as
lighting, head pose and facial expression, providing a nat-
urally ideal option for the encoded feature. Although any
off-the-shelf facial recognition network would be sufﬁcient
for our task, we propose to adopt Light CNN-29V2 [47] due
to its good balance between network size and encoding ef-
ﬁciency. A pre-trained Light CNN-29V2 model is used to
encode an input image into a 256-dimensional feature vec-
tor. We have used a weighted per-vertex L1 loss: weight of
5 for vertices on the facial area (within a radius of 95mm
from the nose tip) and weight of 1 for other vertices.

For shape decoder, we have used three fully connected
(FC) layers, with the output size of 128, 200 and 8,775
respectively. The last FC layer directly predicts concate-
nated vertex coordinates of a generic head model consisting
of 2,925 points, and it is initialized with 200 pre-computed
PCA components explaining more than 99% of the variance
observed in the 10,000 augmented 3D facial shapes. When
compared with unsupervised learning [16], our accessibility
to a high-quality prioritized 3D face scan dataset makes it
possible to achieve higher accuracy by supervision.

3.4. Non-rigid Deformation

3D vertex coordinates generated by the shape regression
neural network is not directly applicable to texture projec-
tion because facial images usually contain unknown factors
such as camera intrinsic, head pose and facial expression.
Meanwhile, since shape regression predicts the overall fa-

cial shape, local parts such as eyes, nose and mouth are not
accurately reconstructed; but they are equally important to
quality perception when comparing against the original face
image. We propose to utilize facial landmarks detected in
a coarse-to-ﬁne fashion and formulate non-rigid deforma-
tion as an optimization problem that jointly optimizes over
camera intrinsic, camera extrinsic, facial expression and a
per-vertex corrective ﬁeld.

Problem Formulation. To handle facial expressions,
we transfer the expression blendshape model in FaceWare-
house [8] to the same head topology with artist’s assis-
tance as {B1, B2, ..., BM }.
In addition, we introduce a
per-vertex correction ﬁeld δP to cover out of space non-
rigid deformation. Finally, a 3D face is reconstructed as

M
(cid:80)
i=1

PF = P +

βiBi + δP. Camera extrinsic T trans-

forms the face from its canonical reference coordinate sys-
tem to the camera coordinate system. It has a 3-DoF vector
t for translation and a 3-DoF quaternion representation q
for rotation. Camera intrinsic K projects the 3D model to
the image plane. During the optimization, we have found
that using a scale factor fs to update the intrinsic matrix
by K = (cid:0) fsf 0 cx
(cid:1) leads to the best numerical stability.
Here [f, cx, cy] are all initialized from the size of the input
image as cx = imh
2 , and f = max(imh, imw).
Putting things together, we can represent the overall param-
eterized vector by p = [β, δP, t, q, fs].

Landmark Term. We employ a global-to-local method
for facial landmark localization. For global inference, we
ﬁrst detect the standard 68 facial landmarks, and use this ini-
tial estimation to crop local areas including eyes, nose, and
mouth - i.e., a total of 4 cropped images. Then we perform
ﬁne-scale local inference on the cropped images (Please see
the supplementary material for more details). The landmark
localization approach produces a set of facial landmarks L
where Li = [Lx
i ]. We propose to minimize the distance

pre-select m on M and follow the sliding scheme [7] to

Corrective Field Regularization. To enforce a smooth
and small per-vertex corrective ﬁeld, we combine the fol-
lowing two losses,

The ﬁrst loss is used to regularize a smooth deformation
by maintaining the Laplacian operator L on the deformed
mesh (please refer to [36] for more details). βt−i indicates
the estimated facial expression blendshape weights from the
last iteration and is a ﬁxed value. The second loss is used
to enforce a small corrective ﬁeld and λδ is used to balance
the two terms.

Other Regularization Terms. We further regularize
on facial expression, focal length scale factor, and rotation
component of camera extrinsic as follows,

Er =

where σ is the vector of eigenvalues of the facial expression
covariance matrix obtained via PCA. λf and λq are regular-
ization parameters.

Summary. Our total loss function is given by

E = El + ωcEc + ωrEr,

(4)

where ωc and ωr are used to balance relative importance of
the three terms. E is optimized by Gauss-Newton approach
over parameters pt for a total of N iterations. For the ini-
tial parameter vector p0, β0 and δP0 are initialized as all-0
vectors, t0 and q0 are estimated from the EPnP approach
[26], and f 0

s is initialized to be 1.

3.5. Texture Processing

Upon non-rigid deformation, we project selﬁe texture to
the UV space of the generic model using the estimated cam-
era intrinsic, head pose, facial expression and per-vertex
correction. While usually only the frontal area on a selﬁe
is visible, we recover textures on other areas, e.g., back of
head and neck, by using the UV texture of one of the 482
subjects that is closest to the query subject. We deﬁne close-
ness as L1 loss on the distance between LightCNN-29V2
embeddings, i.e., through face recognition. Finally given a
foreground projected texture and a background default tex-
ture, we blend them using the Poisson Image Editing [30].

4. Experimental Results

4.1. Implementation Details

For shape regression, we use Adam optimizer with a
learning rate of 0.0001 and the momentum β1 = 0.5,
β2 = 0.999 for 500 epochs. We train on a total of 10,000
synthetically rendered facial images with a batch size of 64.
For non-rigid deformation, we use a total of N = 5 iter-
ations. When minimizing Eq. (4), we use ωc = 25 and
ωr = 10. In Eq. (2), we set λδ = 4, and in Eq. (3) we set
λf = 5 and λq = 5.

4.2. Database and Evaluation Setup

Stirling/ ESRC 3D Faces Database The ESRC [12] is
the latest public 3D faces database captured by a Di3D cam-
era system. The database also provides several images cap-
tured from different viewpoints under various lighting con-
dition. We select those subjects who have both 3D scan and
a frontal neutral face for evaluation. There are total 129
subjects (62 male and 67 female) for testing. Note that in
this dataset, around 95% of people are Caucasian.

The

JNU-Validation Database

JNU-Validation
Database is a part of the JNU 3D face Database collected
It has 161 2D images
by the Jiangnan University [25].
of 10 Asians and their 3D face scans captured by 3dMD.
Since the validation database was not used during training,
we consider it as a test database for Asians. The 2D images
of each subject are in range of [3, 26]. To minimize the
impact of imbalance data, we select three frontal images of
each subject for quantitative comparison.

Our Test Data Since there is no public database avail-
able for testing, which shall cover all the gender and races,
we randomly pick ﬁve subjects from the six group in Table 1
and form a total 30 subjects as the evaluation database. The
other 482 scans are used as for data augmentation and train-
ing/validation stage for both geometry and texture. Each
subject has two testing images: a selﬁe captured by a Sam-
sung Galaxy S7 and an image captured from a Sony a7R
DSLR camera by a photographer.

Evaluation Setup We compared our method with sev-
eral state-of-the-art-methods including 3DMM-CNN [42],
Extreme 3D Face (E3D) [43], PRNet [11], RingNet [32],
and GanFit [14]. The reconstructed model detail of each
methods are shown in Table 2. Note that for our method
and RingNet, both eyes, teeth and tongue and their model
holders are removed before comparison. Because the evalu-
ation metric is using the point-to-plane error, unrelated data
will increase the over all error. Although removing those
parts will also slightly increase the error (e.g., no data in the
eyes area to compare), the introduced error is much smaller
than the error of directly using the original models.

4.3. Quantitative Comparison

Evaluation Metric: To align the reconstructed model
with ground truth, we followed the step of [42, 16, 14] and
the challenge [12]. Since the topology of each method is
ﬁxed, seven pre-selected vertex index is ﬁrst used to roughly
align the reconstructed model to the ground truth and then
the model was further reﬁned by iterative closest point (ICP)
[3]. The position of vertex of the tip of the nose vt is cho-
sen to be the center of the ground truth and reconstructed
models. Given a threshold d mm, we discard those vertex
vi, where ||vi − vt|| > d. To evaluate the reconstructed
model with ground truth, we used the Average Root Mean
Square Error (ARMSE) 3 as suggested by the 2nd 3DFAW
Challenge 4 , where it computes the closest point-to-mesh
distance between the ground truth and predicted model and
vice versa.

ESRC and JNU-validation Dataset: In Figure 3, we
have chosen d = [80, 90, 100, 110] and computed the
ARMSE for each reconstructed model and ground truth.
Note that the annotation provided by ESRC database only
has the seven landmark for alignment, thus instead of us-
ing the tip of nose, we use the average of the 7 landmark
as the center of face.
In ESRC, our result is better than
other methods when d > 95 and our performance is more
resilient as d increases. This indicates that our method can
better replicate the shape of the entire head than other meth-
ods. In JNU-validation database, since other methods are
trained from a Caucasian-dominated 3DMM model, while
the other races are also considered during our augmented
stage, we can achieve much smaller reconstructed error at
every d value.

Our Test Dataset: In Figure 4 (a), the centers of each
error-bar are the average of the ARMSE from the 60 recon-
structed meshes. The range of the errorbar is ±1.96 × SE,
where SE is the standard error.
It is shown that our re-
constructed models is slightly better than GanFit and sig-
niﬁcantly better than other methods. It is worth mention-

ing that our vertex number is only ∼ 70% of RingNet and
less than 6% of other methods. In Figure 4 (b), the cropped
mesh of the ground truth and each methods are shown under
different threshold of d. To utilize the reconstructed mod-
els for real-world application, we believe that d = 110 is
the best value because it captured the entire head instead of
the frontal face. We further investigate the performance un-
der different races and the results are shown in Figure 4 (c).
Our method can correctly replicate the model to under 2.5
mm of error in all ethnicity, while other methods such as
RingNet and PRNet are very sensitive to the ethnicity dif-
ferences. Although GanFit performed slightly better than
our method on White and Black races, the overall perfor-
mance is not as good as ours because they are not able to
recover the Asian geometries well. It is worth noting that
we used 10000 synthetic images augmented from less than
500 scan data, which is only 5% of the data used in Gan-
Fit. To fairly visualize the error between methods without
the effect of different topology, we ﬁnd the closest point-
to-plane distance from ground truth to reconstructed model
and generate the heat-map for each method in Figure 5.

4.4. Ablation Study

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the individual mod-
ules in the proposed approach, we modify one variable at a
time and compare with the following alternatives:

• No Augmentation (No-Aug): Without any augmenta-
tion, we simply repetitively sample 10,000 faces from 482
subjects.

• Categorized-PCA Sampling (C-PCA): Instead of DR
Feature based sampling, we propose a PCA based sampling
method. We train a shape PCA model from 482 subjects,
and for each group in Table 1, a Gaussian random vector
x ∼ N (µi, Σ2
i ) is used to create weights of the principal
shape components, where µi and Σ2
i are the mean vector
and co-variance matrix of those coefﬁcients in the group.
We sample 10,000 faces with this augmentation approach.
Instead of using
high-quality photo-realistic renderer, we use Unity, a stan-

dard game rendering engine, to synthesize facial images.
The quality of rendered images are comparatively lower
than V-ray. We keep the DR feature based augmentation ap-
proach and rendered exactly the same 10000 synthetic faces
mentioned in Section 3.2.

In Fig. 6, our proposed approach outperforms all other
alternatives.
It is expected that without data augmenta-
tion (i.e., No-Aug), the reconstructed error is the worst
among all methods. The difference between C-PCA and
our method proves that DR sampling augmentation creates
more natural synthetic faces for training. The results be-
tween Unity and our method shows that the quality of ren-
dered images plays an important role in bridging the gap
between real and synthetic images.

4.4.1 Qualitative Comparison

Figure 7 shows our shape estimation method on frontal face
images side-by-side with the state-of-the-arts in MoFA test
database. We picked the same images shown in GanFit [14].
Our method creates accurate face geometry, while also cap-
turing discriminate features which allow the identity of each
face to be easily distinguishable from the others. Mean-
while, as shown in Table 2, our result maintains a low geo-
metric complexity. This allows our avatars to be production
ready even in demanding cases such as on mobile platforms.
In Figure 8, we choose a few celebrity to verify the geom-
etry accuracy of our method comparing to others. In Fig-
ure 9, we demonstrate our ﬁnal results with blended diffuse

5. Conclusions and Future Works

In this paper, we demonstrated a supervised learning
approach for estimating high quality 3D face shape with
photo-realistic high-resolution diffuse map. To facilitate
facial image synthesis, we have collected and processed a
prioritized 3D face database, from which we can sample

augmented 3D face shape with UV-texture to render a large
collection of photo-realistic facial images. Unlike previous
approaches, our method leverages the discriminative power
of an off-the-shelf face recognition neural network trained
on millions of synthesized photo-realistic facial images.

We have demonstrated the transferable proﬁciency of the
proposed method from the objective of accurate face recog-
nition to fully reconstruct the facial geometry based on a
single selﬁe. While training on synthetically generated fa-
cial imagery, we have observed strong generalization power
when tested on real-world images. This opens up oppor-
tunities in many interesting applications including VR/AR,
teleconferencing, virtual try-on, computer games, special
effect, and so on.

Supplemental Material

Section 3.2. Scan Pre-processing

As shown in Fig. 10, we process a raw textured 3D fa-
cial scan data to generate our 3D face representation that
consists of a shape model with low polygon count and a
high-resolution diffuse map for preserving details.

Section 3.2. Deformation Representation

Here we give a detailed formulation of the Deformation
Representation (DR) feature. DR feature D encodes local
deformation around each vertex of P with respect to a ref-
erence mesh PR into a R9 vector. We use the mean face of
all 482 processed facial models as the reference mesh.

Encode D from P. We denote the i-th vertex as pi
and pR
i respectively. The deformation gradient in the clos-
est neighborhood Ni of the i-th vertex from the reference
model to the deformed model is deﬁned by the afﬁne trans-
formation matrix Ti that minimizes the following energy

E(Ti) =

(cid:88)

i∈Ni

cij(cid:107)(pi − pj) − Ti(pR

i − pR

j )(cid:107)2,

(5)

where cij is the cotangent weight depending on the refer-
ence model to handle irregular tessellation. With polar de-
composition, Ti is decomposed into a rotation component
Ri and a scaling/shear component Si such that Ti = RiSi.
The rotation matrix can be represented with a rotation axis

Figure 10: Top row: left is the raw facial scan with dense
topology, and right is the model with UV texture; Bottom
row: left is the processed face model with sparse topology,
and right is the model with UV texture.

ωi and rotation angle θi pair, and we further convert them
to the matrix logarithm representation:

logRi = θi





0
ωi,z
−ωi,y

−ωi,z
0
ωi,x



 .

ωi,y
−ωi,x
0

(6)

Finally the DR feature for pi is represented by di =
{logRi; Si − I} where I is the identity matrix. Since
(cid:107)ωi(cid:107) = 1 and Si is symmetric, di has 9 DoF.

Recover P from D. Given the DR feature D and the
reference mesh PR, we ﬁrst recover the afﬁne transforma-
tion Ti for each vertex. Then we try to recover the optimal
P that minimizes:

E(P) =

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

pi∈P

j∈Ni

cij(cid:107)(pi − pj) − Ti(pR

i − pR

j )(cid:107)2. (7)

For each pi, we obtain it by solving ∂E(P)
∂pi

= 0 which gives

(cid:88)

2

j∈Ni

cij(pi − pj) =

(cid:88)

j∈Ni

Ti(pR

i − pR

j ).

(8)

The resulting equations for all pi ∈ P lead to a linear sys-
tem which can be written as AP = b. By specifying the
position of one vertex, we can get the single solution to the
equation to fully recover P.

Section 3.4. Landmark Localization

To achieve higher landmark localization accuracy, we
have developed a coarse-to-ﬁne approach. First, we pre-
dict all facial landmarks from the detected facial bounding
box. Then, given the initial landmarks, we crop the eye,
nose, and mouth areas for the second stage ﬁne-scale land-
mark localization. Fig. 11 shows our landmark mark-up as
well as the bounding boxes used for the ﬁne scale landmark
localization stage. We have used a regression forest based
approach [24] as the base landmark predictor and we train 4
landmark predictors in total, i.e., for overall face, eye, nose
and mouth.

Section 4.4. Different Rendering Quality

In this section, ﬁrst we illustrate the 30 different manu-
ally created lighting conditions used for high-quality Vray
rendering as shown in Fig. 12. Then we provide several syn-
thetic face images rendered from Vray and Unity as shown
in Fig. 13. Note that, for both rendering method, we ran-
domized the head pose, environment map, lighting condi-
tion, and the ﬁeld of view (FOV) to mimic the selﬁe in the
real world. We don’t render eye models, and as a result, we
mask out the eye area with detected facial landmarks during
test time as mentioned in Section 3.2.

we present the results of several celebrities and compare our
method not only for geometry but also in appearance. Note
that by projecting the selﬁe to a high-resolution UV tex-
ture, our reconstructed models has photo-realistic appear-
ance while 3DMM-CNN [42] and PRNet [11] used vertex
color results in limited texture reapplication.

Application - Audio-driven Avatar Animation

Our automatically generated head model is ready for dif-
ferent applications. Here we demonstrate a case of auto-
matic lip syncing driven by a raw waveform audio input as
shown in Fig. 21. For data collection and deep neural net-
work structure, we adopt a similar pipeline as that of [23]
to drive the reconstructed model. All the animation blend-
shapes are transferred to our generic topology. Please refer
to our video for more details.

Section 4.5. More Qualitative Results

In this section, we provide more comparison results that
cannot be included in the paper due to page limits. For
GanFit [14], we have requested them to run the recon-
structed results of our test data. Thus, we are only able
to show the qualitative comparison with GanFit in our test
database. For those images/selﬁes in the other database, we
have compared our results with those papers whose codes
are available online including RingNet [32], PRNet [11],
Extreme3D [43] and 3DMM-CNN [42].

More Qualitative Results of Our Data
In Fig. 14, we provided the qualitative results of each
categories. The ﬁrst and second columns are the input im-
age and the ground truth. Instead of showing the cropped
mesh, we decided to show the whole models for each
method in Fig. 14. It is worth noting that our reconstructed
full head model is ready to be deployed for different appli-
cations.

Qualitative ESRC and JUN-Validate
Due to the paper limitation, we are not able to show the
qualitative result of ESRC and JUN-validate Dataset. As
shown in Figs. 15, we can still see the similar results we
claimed in the paper that the proposed method can correctly
replicate the 3D models from single selﬁes with much lower
polygon.

More Qualitative Results of MoFA In Fig. 16, we have
requested the results from MoFA [39] for side-by-side com-
parisons. Although the quality of reconstructed models are
not as good as the results from other database due to the im-
age resolution, large head pose variation, occlusion such as
hair and glasses, our model is still considerably better than
other methods.
