Abstract Here we discuss the current state of knowledge on how atmospheric escape processes 

can fractionate noble gas isotopes and moderately volatile rock-forming elements that populate 

primordial  atmospheres,  magma  ocean  related  environments,  and  catastrophically  outgassed 

steam  atmospheres.  Variations  of  isotopes  and  volatile  elements  in  different  planetary 

reservoirs  keep  information  about  atmospheric  escape,  composition  and  even  the  source  of 

accreting material. We summarize our knowledge on atmospheric isotope ratios and discuss the 

latest  evidence  that  proto-Venus  and  Earth  captured  small  H2-dominated  primordial 

atmospheres that were lost by EUV-driven hydrodynamic escape after the disk dispersed. All 

relevant  thermal  and  non-thermal  atmospheric  escape  processes  that  can  fractionate  various 

isotopes and volatile elements are discussed. Erosion of early atmospheres, crust and mantle by 

large  planetary  impactors  are  also  addressed.  Further,  we  discuss  how  moderately  volatile 

1 

 
 
 
elements such as the radioactive heat producing element 40K and other rock-forming elements 

such as Mg can also be outgassed and lost from magma oceans that originate on large planetary 

embryos  and  accreting  planets.  Outgassed  elements  escape  from  planetary  embryos  with 

masses that are ≤ MMoon directly, or due to hydrodynamic drag of escaping H atoms originating 

from  primordial-  or  steam  atmospheres  at  more  massive  embryos.  We  discuss  how  these 

processes affect the final elemental composition and ratios such as K/U, Fe/Mg of early planets 

and their building blocks. Finally, we review modeling efforts that constrain the early evolution 

of Venus, Earth and Mars by reproducing their measured present day atmospheric  36Ar/38Ar, 

20Ne/22Ne noble gas isotope ratios and the role of isotopes on the loss of water and its connection 

to the redox state on early Mars.

1  Introduction 

The earliest atmospheric records of Venus, Earth and Mars are stored in the noble gases and 

their isotopes. The reason is that these elements do not react with other atmospheric species or 

the surface. Noble gas elements such as Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe and their isotopes contain historical 

records  related  to  the  early  evolutionary  processes  starting  during  the  accretion  phase  of 

planetesimals to planetary embryos before and after disk dispersal (Ozima and Podosek, 2002; 

Porcelli et al., 2002).    

Depending on how fast planetary embryos grow to larger masses within the disk and at which 

orbital locations they originate or migrate, embryos will evolve to objects with different volatile 

and elemental abundances, which results in different elemental ratios compared to their initial 

ones (Brasser et al. 2019; this issue). Heating by short-lived 26Al and 60Fe radioisotopes shape 

the  thermal  history  and  interior  structure  of  growing  planetesimals  and  planetary  embryos 

during  the  early  stages  of  planetary  formation  (e.g.,  Lichtenberg  et  al.,  2016;  Young  et  al., 

2019).  The  subsequent  thermo-mechanical  evolution,  such  as  magma  ocean-related  internal 

differentiation, rapid volatile degassing, and the possible accumulation of H2/He-envelopes has 

important  implications  for  the  final  structure,  composition  and  evolution  of  terrestrial 

protoplanets (Ikoma and Genda, 2006; Elkins-Tanton, 2012; Massol et al., 2016; Stökl et al., 

2016; Lichtenberg et al., 2016; Benedikt et al., 2019). Under these extreme conditions, noble 

gases  with  low condensation temperatures  such as Ar and Ne,  significant amounts of  major 

rock-forming elements (e.g., K, Si, Mg, Fe, Ca, Al, Na, S, P, Cl), and other moderately volatile 

2 

 
 
 
elements like Rb or Zn with condensation temperatures of ≈  1000 K and lower (Lodders et al., 

2009) populate the hot accretionary atmospheres to significant amounts (Albarède and Blichert-

Toft, 2007; Schaefer and Fegley, 2007; Fegley et al., 2016).  

If one considers for instance  a mixture of ordinary chondrites with enstatite-like material 

and/or carbonaceous chondrites with ureilites as recently suggested by Schiller et al. (2018) as 

indicated by specific isotopic abundances to be the parent bodies of the Earth, then the terrestrial 

K/U ratio would be higher than the present-day ratio. This indicates that most likely some loss 

process during proto-Earth’s accretion was necessary to deplete moderately volatile elements 

and fractionate K from U. Since radioactive decay of the heat producing element 40K contributes 

to drive a long-lived magnetic dynamo and influences the long-term temperature evolution of 

a planet’s interior (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 2002; Murthy et al., 2003; Nimmo, 2015; O’Neill 

et al., 2019; this issue), it is very important to investigate how atmospheric escape can modify 

the amount of 40K and other moderately volatile elements such as Si, Mg, Fe, Ca, Al, Na, S, P, 

Cl, Rb, Zn until an Earth-like planet finishes its accretion.  

Although planetary embryos grow within the protoplanetary disk (Wade and Wood, 2005), 

these bodies  are differentiated and depleted in  moderate  volatile  elements  (Hin  et  al.,  2017; 

Young et al., 2019) due to the loss of a magma ocean-related catastrophically outgassed steam 

atmospheres (Odert et al., 2018b; Benedikt et al., 2019) as soon as they are not surrounded by 

the nebula gas anymore. Hydrodynamic atmospheric escape, which is controlled by planetary 

parameters (e.g. Lammer et al., 2016; Owen and Wu, 2016; Guo, 2019) and the EUV flux of 

their young host stars (e.g. Koskinen et al., 2013; Erkaev et al., 2013, 2015, 2016; Lammer et 

al.,  2014;  Odert  et  al.,  2018b;  Kubyshkina  et  al.,  2018c;  Guo,  2019;  Benedikt  et  al.,  2019; 

Zahnle et al., 2019), can be very efficient if the mass of the protoplanetary body is small and 

the main upper atmospheric species is hydrogen. If hydrogen, which either originates from gas 

accretion in the disk or from dissociation of H2O vapour of a magma ocean-related outgassed 

steam atmosphere, escapes efficiently, H atoms can drag along heavier species to space (Zahnle 

and Kasting, 1986; Hunten et al., 1987; Zahnle et al., 1990; Chassefière, 1996a, 1996b; Odert 

et al., 2018b; Guo, 2019; Benedikt et al., 2019; Zahnle et al., 2019). The conditions under which 

this so-called post-nebula atmospheric escape and volatilization processes take place, further 

lead to the modification of volatile composition and elemental abundances, as well as to the 

odd elemental and isotopic ratios that are observed in the Solar System planets (e.g. Gillmann 

et al., 2009; Marty, 2012; Jellinek and Jackson, 2015; Bonsor et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2015; 

Benedikt et al., 2019; Lammer et al., 2019).

The  main  aim  of  this  work  is  to  review  the  latest  knowledge  on  various  atmospheric 

evolution and escape processes that fractionate isotopes and elements during Venus’, Earth’s 

and Mars’ atmosphere evolution since their accretion phase in the disk. Sect. 2 summarizes our 

knowledge on the main atmospheric isotopic species and the composition of terrestrial planets 

obtained from various space missions. In Sect. 3 we discuss the evidence that accreting proto-

Venus and Earth captured primordial atmospheres during their growth within the disk. Here we 

also discuss briefly the new knowledge obtained from exoplanet research and the discovery of 

H2-dominated  low  mass  exoplanets.  In  Sect.  4  we  briefly  review  various  thermal  and  non-

thermal atmospheric loss processes and discuss their role in isotopic fractionation of different 

atmospheric species. In Sect. 5 the role of impact erosion of primordial atmospheres and crustal 

material as well as the role of this process in the modification of volatile elements of accreting 

protoplanets  are  discussed.  In  Sect.  6  we  address  the  loss  and  isotopic  and  elemental 

fractionation of rock-forming volatile elements and noble gases from solidifying magma oceans 

from Moon- to Mars-like planetary embryos. In Sections 7 and 8 we address the latest attempts 

for constraining the early evolution of Venus and Earth and Mars by reproducing their present 

noble  gas  and  elemental  ratios  until  these  planets  finished  accretion.  Sect.  9  concludes  the 

review.   

2 Atmospheric isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets 

Noble gases can be seen as a key to a planet’s past because their abundances and isotope ratios 

represent the earliest record of atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Their evolved isotope ratios 

contain records of cataclysmic events that the evolving atmospheres experienced. These could 

be  collisions  with  planetary  embryos,  comets,  mass-fractionating  atmospheric  escape 

processes, outgassing from the planetary interior and geologic upheavals (Becker et al., 2003; 

Baines et al., 2013; Lammer et al., 2018). 

Table  1  summarizes  and  compares  the  observed  atmospheric  isotope  ratios  in  the 

atmospheres of Venus, Earth and Mars. The large Martian atmospheric 14N/15N disequilibrium 

(Fox and Hać, 1997; Füri and Marty, 2015) between the atmosphere and mantle and the similar 

but  smaller  disequilibrium  on  Earth  (Cartigny  and  Marty,  2013)  combined  with  the 

fractionation of the significantly heavier Xe isotopes (e.g., Pepin, 1991; 2000; Cassata, 2017; 

Avice et al., 2018; Zahnle et al., 2019; Avice and Marty, 2019; this issue) are a strong indication 

for  different  mass-  and/or  ionization-related  atmospheric  escape  processes  and  atmosphere-

magnetosphere  environments  of  early  Earth  and  Mars.  These  processes  were  shaped  by  the 

young Sun’s radiation and plasma conditions (Lammer et al., 2018; and references therein). A 

detailed discussion on the nitrogen and Xe disequilibria in Earth’s and Mars’ atmosphere can 
4 

 
 
be found in Avice and Marty (2019; this issue). Additionally to Earth, icy moons such as Triton 

or the dwarf planet Pluto also possessing N2-dominated atmospheres. For example, Titan has a 

1.45  bar  atmosphere  with  a  N2-dominated  atmosphere  (Strobel  and  Shemansky,  1982; 

Coustenis  and  Taylor,  2008).  However,  the  origin  of  such  atmospheres  is  related  to  early 

photolysis of accreted and outgassed NH3 from subsurface H2O-NH3 oceans, leading to a very 

different evolution compared to Earth’s N2 atmosphere (Coustenis and Taylor, 2008; Mandt et 

al.,  2009,  2014).  The  origin  and  evolution  of  atmospheres  that  are  constrained  by  14N/15N 

isotope ratios at frozen worlds like Titan, Triton, and Pluto are discussed in Scherf et al., 2019; 

this issue). Here we focus mainly on noble gases and moderate volatile rock-forming element 

evolution  on  planetary  embryos,  early  Venus,  Earth  and  Mars  that  originated  in  an  inner 

planetary system.  

The  present  atmospheric  36Ar/38Ar  and  20Ne/22Ne  noble  gas  isotope  ratios  can  provide 

historical records on the growth rate of proto-Venus and Earth in the presence of the nebula 

(Lammer et al., 2019) and hence their early atmospheric evolution, which is also the case for 

Mars (e.g., Jakosky et al., 1994; 2017; Kurokawa et al., 2018). The atmospheric 36Ar/22Ne ratio 

also contains evidence related to the post-primordial atmosphere impactor composition that was 

delivered to terrestrial planets (Marty and Allé, 1994; Marty 2012; Lammer et al., 2019).  

A  reproduction  of  the  primordial  and  steam  atmosphere  related  D/H  ratios  yields 

information  that  may  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  oxidation  states  and  initial  H2O 

inventories of terrestrial planets. The terrestrial water (oceans) and meteorites are enriched by 

a factor of about 6 in D relative to the protosolar nebula value (Robert et al., 1999; Marty, 2012; 

Pahlevan  et  al.,  2019).  Besides  heterogeneities  in  the  disk,  mass  fractionation  during 

atmospheric escape processes from  early terrestrial planets can enrich water in oceans in D, 

since  the  lighter  isotopes  are  preferentially  concentrated  in  the  escaping  upper  atmosphere 

relative to ocean water (Genda and Ikoma, 2008).  

The preservation of a carbonaceous chondritic D/H signature with a mean statistical D/H 

ratio of (150 ± 10) × 10-4 (e.g., Robert et al., 2012) in Earth’s seawater (Marty, 2012) provides 

evidence that early Earth’s ocean underwent minimal D-enrichment via equilibration with H2 

followed by hydrodynamic escape. According to the recent results of Pahlevan et al. (2019) the 

close  match  of  ≈ 10  -  20  %  between  Earth’s  seawater  and  carbonaceous  chondrites  further 

constrains the prior existence of an atmospheric H2-inventory of any origin on post-giant-impact 

Earth to <  20 bars. Moreover, the observed oxidation of silicate Earth occurred before or during 

the crystallization of the final magma ocean (Pahlevan et al., 2019). Unless D escape is very 

efficient on Venus, the present H escape flux (averaged over a solar cycle) cannot be larger than 

5 

 
about  107  cm-2  s-1,  if  the  present  water  vapour  in  Venus’  atmosphere  is  a  remnant  of  water 

deposited billion years ago (Donahue, 1999). On the other hand, these authors argued that, if 

the escape flux remains constant and is as large as about 3×107 cm-2 s-1, water would be the 

remnant of H2O outgassed only about 500 million years ago. If the hydrogen escape fluxes were 

> 3 × 107 cm-2 s-1  during the past 100 Myrs then the present day D/H ratio in Venus’ atmosphere 

could have been created since a massive resurfacing event a few 100 Myrs ago (Grinspoon, 

1993).

Hydrogen escape rates based on the loss of suprathermal H atoms and ions on present Venus 

were  studied  by  Lammer  et  al.  (2006).  These  authors  modelled  photochemically  produced 

suprathermal H atom escape rates in the order of ≈ 3.8 × 1025 s-1 which is in agreement with the 
6 

 
 
estimates of Donahue and Hartle (1992). Ion escape rates were uncertain at that time and only 

model-based H+ escape rates in the order of ≈7.0×1025 s-1 largely overestimated the escape from 

Venus  over  the  planets  nightside  by  assuming  ion  acceleration  by  an  outward  electric 

polarization force related to ionospheric holes (Hartle and Grebowsky, 1993). A recent study 

that investigated the H+ escape from Venus during 8 years of data from the Venus Express ion 

mass analyser instrument obtained much lower H+ ion loss rates in the order of  ≈7.6 ×1024 s-1 

at  solar  minimum  and  ≈  2.1  ×  1024  s-1  during  solar  maximum  (Persson  et  al.,  2018).  These 

authors found that the decrease of the H+ ion escape from solar minimum to maximum is caused 

mainly  by  the  change  in  the  flow  direction  in  the  magnetotail.  During  solar  maximum  a 

significant Venus ward ion flow close to the planet and its magnetotail was observed (Persson 

et al., 2018). Thus, the present day Venus total hydrogen escape is in the order of ≈ 4.5 ×1025 

s-1 (≤ 107 cm-2 s-1) with suprathermal H atom escape as the dominant process. 

The findings of lower H+ ion escape rates by Persson et al. (2018) compared to previous 

estimates  indicates  that  Venus’  present  D/H  ratio  is  most  likely  a  remnant  of  the  ancient 

evaporated water inventory and subsequently outgassed water vapour that were  modified by 

various non-thermal atmospheric escape processes during time periods that lasted longer than 

the last resurfacing event 500±200 Myr ago.   

Other isotopes such as 16O/17O, 16O/18O may reveal information related to a common kinship 

of the planets (e.g., Clayton, 1993; Yurimoto et al., 2006), 33S/32S and 34S/32S isotopes contain 

evidence on the past and current planetary volcanic activity and magmatic composition (e.g., 

Mahaffy et  al., 2012), outgassing from the interior is recorded by  4He,  40Ar and  129,131-136Xe 

(e.g., Allègre et al., 1987; Marty and Allé, 1994; Watson et al., 2007), and 12C/13C can be related 

to a possible biological activity (e.g., Galimov, 1985; 2003).  As one can see in Table 1, several 

isotopes have large error bars or were not measured by spacecraft in the past. Therefore, new 

future in-situ measurements of these isotopes as discussed in Dandouras et al. (2019; this issue) 

in  planetary  atmospheres  are  necessary  for  constraining  and  understanding  the  state  and 

evolution of terrestrial planets in the Solar System and beyond. 

3  The disk phase: H2-dominated envelopes on low mass planets 

In the Solar System, there are two well-separated classes of planets: rocky planets (Mercury, 

Venus, Earth, and Mars with average densities between 3.7 and 5.5 g cm-3) and gas/ice giants 

(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune with average densities between 0.7 and 1.6 g cm-3). The 

rocky  planets  have  a  mass  of  about  one  Earth-mass  (MEarth),  or  less,  while  gas  giants  have 

masses of tens to hundreds of MEarth. However, the largest population of exoplanets discovered 

7 

 
to date has a mass/radius falling between those of the Earth and Neptune (e.g., Mullally et al., 

2015), demonstrating that the variety of planets existing in nature is much larger than previously 

thought. 

3.1 Low mass exoplanets with primordial atmospheres 

The mass-radius, or equivalently mass-density, diagram is the first diagnostic enabling the basic 

classification of a planet, e.g. identify whether a planet hosts a H2-dominated atmosphere or 

not. The rapidly increasing sample of Neptune-like planets and smaller for which we have a 

measurement of both mass and radius indicates that these planets present a surprisingly large 

variety of densities (see Fig. 1). 

Fig. 1. Left: known exoplanets with masses smaller than Neptune in the mass vs radius plane, in Earth 
units.  The  color  indicates  the  planetary  equilibrium  temperature  Teq.  The  black,  red,  and  blue  lines 
indicate compositions corresponding to 100% Fe, 100% Rock, and 100% water, respectively (from Zeng 
et al. 2016). Right: same as left panel, but considering only planets with a mass and radius known to 
better than 25%. Data from the NASA exoplanet archive (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). 

This  can  be  clearly  seen  in  the  left  panel  of  Fig. 1  showing  the  position  of  the  known 

exoplanets with a mass smaller than Neptune in the mass vs. radius diagram, color-coded by 

the planetary equilibrium temperature (Teq). This plot clearly indicates the presence of a large 

spread in planetary radius, and thus density, at a given mass, particularly for planets with masses 

larger than 1.5-2.0 MEarth. The same can be seen also when considering only systems for which 

masses and radii are known to better than 25% (Fig. 1, right panel), indicating that this large 

spread in bulk density is not the result of large uncertainties on the planetary parameters.  

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although  planetary  cores  with  various  densities/compositions  certainly  exist,  this  spread  is 

most likely tightly related to the existence of a large variety of planetary atmospheres that can 

range  from  being  H2-dominated  primordial  atmospheres  to  CO2/H2O-dominated  steam 

atmospheres, or secondary atmospheres, thus more compact. Furthermore, this spread does not 

seem to be directly correlated with the amount of irradiation they receive from the host star. 

The origin of this phenomenon is unclear and several factors are likely to play a role, such as 

protoplanetary nebula lifetime (e.g., Stökl et al., 2015; 2016), mass accretion time (e.g., Schiller 

et al., 2018), migration history, collisions (e.g., Bonomo et al., 2019), received amount of high-

energy irradiation (e.g., Fossati et al., 2017; Owen and Wu, 2017; Zahnle and Catling, 2017; 

Jin and Mordasini, 2018; Kubyshkina et al., 2018a; 2018b), possible biases in the measurement 

of  planetary  radii  due  to  the  presence  of  high-altitude  aerosols  (e.g.,  Lammer  et  al.,  2016; 

Cubillos et al., 2017a; 2017b). 

It has been shown that these planets are likely to have Earth-like density cores (Owen and 

Wu, 2017) and the observations conducted to date clearly show that a number of them still host 

an H2-dominated atmosphere, most likely accreted from the protoplanetary nebula, despite their 

close distance to the host star. It is therefore possible that also the inner planets of the Solar 

System began their evolution with a rocky core surrounded by an H2-dominated envelope.   

3.2 Evidence of captured nebula gas during early Earth’s and Venus’ accretion 

Besides disk lifetime (e.g. Montmerle et al., 2006; Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) and 

the young Sun’s X-ray, EUV and FUV fluxes and plasma winds (Tu et al., 2015; see also Güdel 

et  al.,  2019;  this  issue),  the  accretion  time  is  the  relevant  factor  on  whether  a  protoplanet 

captured enough mass to be able to accumulate and sustain an H2-dominated envelope after the 

disk disappeared (e.g., Ikoma and Genda, 2006; Lammer et al., 2016; Stökl et al., 2015; 2016; 

Lammer et al., 2019). In the case of the early terrestrial planets in the Solar System, scientists 

of various  research areas debate since decades whether it was  possible  for proto-Venus  and 

Earth to accrete enough mass during the disk lifetime for accumulating nebula gas before the 

disk disappeared. If a protoplanet reached a mass > 0.5MEarth before the disk evaporated it could 

have captured a small  H2-dominated envelope  that  remains  after  the nebula dissipated  (e.g., 

Ikoma and Genda, 2006; Stökl et al., 2015; 2016; see also Lammer et al., 2019b; this issue). 

Captured  nebula  gas  was  used  in  past  attempts  to  reproduce  the  present  atmospheric 

36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne noble gas ratios of Venus and Earth by various researchers (e.g., Sekiya 

et al.. 1980a; 1980b; Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1989; Harper and Jacobsen, 1996; Pepin, 2000, 

Porcelli and Pepin, 2000; Porcelli et al., 2001; Gillmann, 2009; Odert et al., 2018; Lammer et 

9 

 
al., 2019). In the case of the Earth, there is data from 20Ne/22Ne isotope ratios in mantle material 

indicating that a fraction of noble gases has been trapped in Earth’s interior in solar composition 

from  the  protoplanetary  disk  (Mizuno  et  al.  1980;  Porcelli  et  al.,  2001;  Yokochi  and  Marty 

2004;  Mukhopadhyay,  2012).  Some  researchers  argued  that  these  20Ne/22Ne  isotope  ratios 

between 12.52-12.75 could have also been reproduced through implantation of solar wind onto 

accreted material (Trieloff, 2000; Podosek, 2003; Feigelson et al., 2002; Raquin and Moreira, 

2009;  Moreira, 2016;  Péron et  al., 2016; 2017). Later on, such solar wind related noble gas 

isotopes  could  then  be  outgassed  during  the  magma  ocean  phase.  A  recent  study,  however, 

measured 20Ne/22Ne values up to 13.03 ± 0.04 from deep mantle plumes and determined a ratio 

for the primordial plume mantle of 13.23 ± 0.22 (Williams and Mukhopadhyay 2019). These 

values are only slightly fractionated but comparable with the nebular (solar) ratio. Even if the 

debate carries on, this can be seen as a robust evidence for a reservoir of nebular gas that is 

preserved in the deep mantle.  

If the accreting proto-Venus and Earth captured H2-dominated envelopes from the disk then 

these primordial atmospheres were lost during some time after disk dispersal. Below we discuss 

various atmospheric escape processes, there efficiencies and capabilities for the fractionation 

of various elements (i.e., isotopes and volatile elements, including rock-forming ones).  

4  Atmospheric escape processes and their relevance for elemental 

fractionation 

Losses of atmospheric gases to space are caused by a large number of physical processes taking 

place in the thermosphere, exosphere, and in the case of the Earth in the magnetosphere. These 

processes are mostly driven by inputs from the Sun in the forms of its high energy radiative 

spectrum and the solar wind. For this reason, loss processes were more important during earlier 

phases of the solar system when the Sun was more active. 

4.1 Upper atmospheres 

The  upper  atmospheres  of  planets  are  of  primarily  importance  for  determining  how  rapidly 

atmospheric gases are lost to space and for determining the relative losses of different elements 

and  isotopes.  Understanding  how  Earth’s  upper  atmosphere  has  evolved  is  important  for 

understanding  the  effects  of  losses  on  isotopic  fractionation.  Various  atmospheric  layers  of 

interest are outlined in Fig. 2. The main layers in a planetary atmosphere can be defined by the 

temperature  structure.  On  Earth,  above  the  troposphere  and  stratosphere,  starting  at 

approximately 50 km altitude, is a region called the mesosphere; in this region, the temperature 

decreases with altitude due to cooling by CO2 molecules emitting infrared radiation to space. 
10 

 
Above this is the thermosphere, starting at approximately 100 km altitude, which is heated by 

the  Sun's  X-ray,  extreme  ultraviolet  and  ultraviolet  radiation,  and  therefore  has  a  positive 

temperature  gradient.  The  top  of  the  thermosphere  is  the  exobase  (typically  at  altitudes  of  

≈  500 km for the modern Earth), which is the point above which the gas density is so low that 

the mean free paths of particles are long enough compared to the scale height of the atmosphere 

that the gas is non-collisional. This non-collisional region above the exobase is the exosphere. 

An additional important layer is the thermosphere-ionosphere region, which starts in the upper 

mesosphere and extends to the exobase. This is the domain in which most of the Sun's X-ray 

and extreme ultraviolet radiation is absorbed, which causes photoionization of the atmospheric 

constituents.  

In the thermosphere, the composition of the gas not only changes due to molecular diffusion, 

but  also  due  to  photodissociation  and  photoionization,  driven  by  the  absorption  of  solar 

radiation at wavelengths below approximately 200 nm. For the modern Earth, the dissociation 

of O2 and N2 molecules, combined with molecular diffusion, mean that the gas in the exobase 

is primarily composed of atomic O and N. The 

absorption  of 

this 

radiation  has  several 

additional  effects  on  the  gas,  with  the  most 

important  being  heating. When the  atmosphere 

is  in  a  steady  state,  this  heating  of  the  upper 

atmosphere is balanced by cooling from infrared 

emission to space, particularly by CO2.  

Fig. 2. Earth’s atmospheric temperature structure and 
regions of interest. 

Locally within the gas however, heating and 

cooling do not balance, and downward thermal 

conduction is in fact the main process responsible for cooling the upper thermosphere.  

For Venus and Mars, the same basic set of physical processes are important in the upper 

atmospheres, with the only additional important process being heating by the absorption of solar 

infrared radiation by CO2 (Fox et al., 1991). The high CO2 concentration in these atmospheres 

also means that infrared cooling is much stronger and the thermospheres are therefore much 

cooler. The higher concentrations of CO2 expected in the Earth's atmosphere at earlier times 

would  also  likely  have  this  effect,  cooling  the  atmosphere  and  reducing  the  effects  of 

atmospheric loss (Kulikov et al., 2007; Johnstone et al., 2018). 

11 

 
 
It is common to break down the vertical structure of an atmosphere into the homosphere and 

heterosphere.  In  the  homosphere,  which  for  the  Earth  extends  from  the  surface  to  the 

homopause at approximately 120 km altitude, turbulent mixing of the gas causes the mixing 

ratios of all long lived species (those that are not rapidly created and destroyed by chemical 

processes) to be uniform with altitude regardless of the particle masses. 

Fig.  3.  Illustration  of  density-altitude  structures  in  the  homosphere-heterosphere  transition 
region. In the homosphere the atmosphere is mixed and all species are distributed by the same 
average scale height (homosphere), while above the homopause all species are distributed by 
their own scale heights as a function of mass. The density of heavy elements decreases very 
fast compared to light elements.  

This  process  is  often  known  as  eddy  diffusion  and  is  responsible  for  allowing  heavier 

particles such as CO2 molecules and noble gases such as Ne, Ar, and even Xe atoms to reach 

the  lower  thermosphere.  Without  eddy  diffusion,  the  abundances  of  heavier  particles  would 

rapidly  drop  with  increasing  altitude  as  molecular  diffusion  separates  the  particles  by  mass. 

This is indeed what happens above the homopause, with the abundances of heavier particles 

becoming  extremely  low  in  the  mid  and  upper  thermospheres.  This  process  contributes  to 

causing lighter particles to be lost from the atmosphere more efficiently than heavier particles. 

A related and imported concept is that of diffusion-limited escape. This is itself not a loss 

process but an upper limit on how rapidly minor (low-abundance) species can be lost from the 

upper atmosphere of a planet. This limit exists because minor species cannot be lost from the 

upper atmosphere more rapidly than they can be transported upwards by molecular diffusion at 

the homopause. The reason to consider the homopause here, or at least the region directly above 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the homopause, is that this is the region in the heterosphere where molecular diffusion is the 

least efficient due to the high density and relatively low temperature.  

For  instance,  H  atom  escape  on  present  Earth,  Venus  and  Mars  is  limited  by  upward 

diffusion through the upper atmosphere (e.g. Hunten, 1975; Kasting and Pollack, 1983). On 

Earth,  H2O,  H2,  and  CH4  move  upward  in  the  atmosphere  via  turbulent  mixing  up  to  the 

homopause. At ≈17 km, the cool temperatures at the tropopause freeze out most of the water 

vapour,  preventing  the  upward  mixing  of  some  hydrogen.  Near  the  homopause  hydrogen 

bearing  molecules  (i.e.  CH4)  are  dissociated  by  UV  photons  so  that  atomic  and  molecular 

hydrogen particles are produced. These H and H2 particles diffuse upward through the upper 

atmosphere  to  the  exobase  level  from  where  they  can  escape  by  thermal  Jeans  escape.  On 

present  Earth,  the  “bottleneck”  for  hydrogen  escape  is  therefore  diffusion-limited.  This 

diffusion-limited flux is proportional to the hydrogen-mixing ratio at the homopause, which is 

≈5.0  ×10-7  at  present  Venus  (Kasting  and  Pollack,  1983)  and  ≈3.0  ×10-5  at  present  Mars 

(Krasnopolsky and Feldman, 2001). For such low water vapour mixing ratios at the homopause 

the escape of hydrogen at the exobase level at Mars and Venus, but also at Earth are thermal 

Jeans escape. 

Higher homopause water mixing ratios lead to higher escape rates that are not controlled by 

diffusion through the upper atmosphere anymore.  Kasting and Pollack (1983) found that for 

H2O  mixing  ratios  at  the  homopause  that  are  ≥  5.0  ×10-4  the  stellar/solar  EUV  flux  that  is 

absorbed  above  the  homopause  level  in  a  hydrostatic  atmosphere  becomes  larger  than  the 

energy that is carried away by the thermally escaping particles. At such high H2O mixing ratios 

at the homopause level the hydrogen-dominated upper atmosphere becomes unstable against 

expansion  and  Jeans  escape  transfers  to  hydrodynamic  escape.  According  to  Kasting  and 

Pollack (1983), for H2O mixing ratios at the homopause that are ≥ 10-3 the hydrogen escape 

flux reaches values that are comparable to energy limited escape. High H2O-mixing ratios at 

the homopause level in the order of 0.1 and higher can originate in steam atmospheres (e.g., 

Lebrun et al., 2013; Massol et al., 2016; Salvator et al., 2017; Benedikt et al., 2019). Under such 

conditions  thermal  escape  of  H  atoms  from  the  upper  atmosphere  and  the  corresponding 

fractionation  of  isotopes  and  other  heavier  minor  and/or  trace  species  is  then  controlled  by 

thermal hydrodynamic escape (e.g., Hunten, 1973; Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Hunten et al., 

1987; Zahnle et al., 1990; Odert et al., 2018; Lammer et al., 2019). 

Atmospheric Loss Processes and their influence on isotope fractionation 

13 

 
Loss  processes  are  often  broken  down  into  thermal  and  non-thermal  processes.  Thermal 

processes are related to the thermal energy of the gas and can be primarily broken down into 

Jeans escape and hydrodynamic escape. Non-thermal processes are essentially all others. Most 

escape processes preferentially remove lighter isotopes, though they differ in how efficiently 

they  fractionate  by  mass.  The  ability  of  an  escape  process  to  fractionate  isotopes  is  often 

described by a fractionation factor f, with f>1 meaning that the heavier isotope is preferentially 

removed, f<1 meaning that the escape process preferentially removes the lighter isotope, and 

f=1 describing the case of no fractionation. The Rayleigh distillation relationship is commonly 

used to describe fractionation of an isotope ratio due to a separate process. This relationship 

connects the initial, n0, and current, n, inventory of the constituent and a fractionation factor of 

the escape process, f (e.g., Lunine et al., 1999; Donahue, 1999; Mandt et al., 2009; 2014; 2015): 

n0/n = (R/R0)1/1-f,   

(1) 

where R is the current ratio of the heavy to light isotope abundance, and R0 is the initial ratio. 

The ratio  R/R0 defines the degree of enrichment in  the heavier isotope in comparison  to  the 

primordial value. The upper limit of the enrichment of the heavier isotope can be found as 

R/R0 ≤ (φt/n+1)(1-f),  

(2) 

where φ is  the maximum  escape flux and  t  is time. Different  escape processes have various 

possible maximum escape fluxes and different fractionation coefficients that can depend on the 

structure and the composition of the upper atmosphere. Below, we briefly summarize the main 

atmospheric escape processes and their influence on the atmospheric fractionation. 

Jeans escape: when an upper atmosphere is hydrostatic and is not able to flow away from 

the planet hydrodynamically, it is still possible for particles in the high-speed tail of the thermal 

distribution of particles at the exobase to have speeds exceeding the escape velocity. The loss 

of  such  particles  is  known  as  Jeans  escape.  This  process  leads  to  highly  mass-dependent 

fractionation. For the present solar system planets, Jeans escape rates are quite low, so that it 

takes a long  time to  fractionate a large  atmospheric reservoir assuming  present  escape rates 

(Mandt et al., 2014) though the process would have been much more rapid at earlier times when 

the Sun was much more active. The fractionation factor f for Jeans escape can be written as 

(e.g., Mandt et al., 2009) 

𝑓 = √

𝑚1
𝑚2

[𝑒(𝜆1−𝜆2) (1+𝜆2)
(1+𝜆1)

].  

(3) 

Hydrodynamic escape: if the upper atmosphere is heated by the EUV flux of the planet’s 

host star to very high temperatures, it is possible that the gas in the upper atmosphere  flows 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
away from the planet with a speed at the exobase exceeding the escape speed. Such a flow has 

the form of a transonic Parker wind (e.g. Tian et al., 2005; Johnstone et al., 2019). Whether an 

atmosphere reaches this state depends on the gas temperature in the upper atmosphere and the 

mass of the planet, with hydrodynamic escape taking place significantly more readily for lower 

mass planets. The source of the energy that heats the gas is typically the X-ray and ultraviolet 

field  of  the  star.  Very  early  in  a  planet’s  history,  immediately  after  the  dissipation  of  the 

primordial  nebula,  it  is  also  possible  for  hydrodynamic  escape  to  be  powered  by  the  initial 

accretion energy of the envelope gas (Stökl et al., 2015) and the bolometric radiative emission 

of the star (Owen and Wu, 2016), though the latter is unlikely to have been significant for the 

young solar system planets due to their large distances from the Sun. Previous works have found 

that  hydrodynamic  escape  removes  all  isotopes  very  efficiently,  which  leads  to  small 

fractionations  (Mandt  et  al.,  2009).  For  hydrodynamic  escape  the  fractionation  factor  f 

converges towards 

     𝑓 = √

𝑚1
𝑚2

,    

(4) 

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the lighter and heavier isotope, respectively. 

When hydrogen atoms escapes hydrodynamically, however, it will drag heavier elements 

with it. This effect can subsequently lead to a fractionation of lighter isotopes to heavier isotopes 

(e.g., Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Hunten et al., 1987; Zahnle et al., 1990; Odert et al., 2018). If 

besides hydrogen one assumes a second major species, e.g. oxygen, in the hydrodynamically 

escaping atmosphere, which is also dragged by hydrogen, then the fractionation factors xi for 

the  second  major  species  and  xj  for  an  arbitrary  amount  of  additional  minor  species  can  be 

written as (e.g., Odert et al., 2018) 

𝑥𝑖 = 1 −

and 𝑓𝑖 the mixing ratio of the second major species to hydrogen.

Ion pick-up: above the exobase, neutral atmospheric particles follow ballistic trajectories. If 

these particles reach the region above the magnetopause or ionopause, they can directly interact 

with the solar wind, where they can be ionized by solar XUV radiation and interactions with 

the solar wind. These ions are picked up by the solar wind and are lost from the planet. If a 

planet does not have an intrinsic magnetic field, as is the case for modern Mars and Venus, then 

the solar wind can directly interact with the ionosphere of the planet, thus making the ion pick 

up escape more efficient. For a magnetized planet, atmospheric particles have first to reach the 

location of the magnetopause to be picked up by the solar wind, which can reduce the ion pick 

up  escape  rates  in  comparison  to  the  non-magnetized  case.  Due  to  diffusive  separation  of 

atmospheric  particles  by  mass  above  the  homopause  (see  also  Fig.  2),  isotopes  with  lighter 

masses reach higher altitudes and will therefore be preferentially removed from the top of the 

atmosphere. For non-thermal escape such as ion pick-up, the fractionation factor can be defined 

as follows (Lunine et al. 1999, Mandt et al. 2014), i.e.  

𝑓 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [−

𝑔(Δ𝑧)(𝑚2−𝑚1)
𝑘𝐵𝑇

],  

(7) 

where Δ𝑧 = 𝑟𝑒 − 𝑟ℎ is the distance between the homopause 𝑟ℎ and the exobase 𝑟𝑒  levels (see 

also Fig. 2) if the planet has no intrinsic magnetic field, otherwise the exobase can be substituted 

by the magnetopause. 

Sputtering:  in  this  process,  atmospheric  atoms  or  molecules  are  ejected  due  to  collisions 

between solar wind protons and backscattered pick-up ions with the planetary atmosphere (e.g., 

Johnson, 1990). This process efficiently fractionates the isotopes through diffusion as a function 

of  the  temperature  in  the  upper  atmosphere  and  the  distance  between  the  exobase  and  the 

homopause.  Like  with  other  loss  processes,  the  efficiency  of  the  fractionation  by  sputtering 

depends  on  the  exact  structure  of  the  upper  atmosphere,  with  expanded  atmospheres 

fractionated more easily (Johnstone et al., 2018). Sputtering preferentially removes the lighter 

atom or particle. On low mass planetary bodies such as Mars, ion pick up and sputtering are 

likely the two fractionation processes that led to the observed 38Ar/36Ar fractionation (Jakosky 

et al., 2017). The fractionation factor f can be calculated in the same as for ion pick-up escape. 

Plasma instabilities: plasma instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholz instability, can drive an 

escape of plasma vortexes from the ionospheric boundary from planets which have no intrinsic 

magnetic dynamo (i.e., Venus, Mars,…). A wave-like structure of initially small amplitudes 

can grow and form  vortexes. These vortexes detach from  the ionized upper atmosphere and 

escape from the planet in a plasma cloud. This escape process is relevant for planets with weak 

or  no  intrinsic  magnetic  fields  (Terada  et  al.,  2002;  Amerstorfer  et  al.,  2007).  Since  plasma 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
instabilities  remove  a  large  number  of  ions  at  once,  they  are  not  very  efficient  isotope 

fractionators. 

Cold  ion-outflows:  ions  and  free  electrons  produced  by  the  absorption  of  solar  extreme 

ultraviolet and X-ray photons are able to escape by a separate process. The expansion of the 

lighter electrons produces an ambipolar electric field that accelerates the ions away from the 

planet causing an outflow of ions and electrons (Ganguli, 1996). For magnetised planets like 

the Earth, this flow takes place at the magnetic poles. This process can accelerate the planetary 

ions and, if they reach a sufficiently high velocity, lead to them escaping the planet’s gravity 

(e.g.,  Hartle  et  al.,  1993;  Lundin  et  al.,  2011).  Heavier  ions  can  also  be  dragged  by  other 

atmospheric constituents through this process, as was probably the case for the  easy ionized 

Xe+ isotopes in the Earth’s and Mars’ atmosphere (e.g., Zahnle et al., 2019; Avice and Marty, 

2019; this issue).  

Photochemical escape: this type of escape is related to chemical reactions that produce hot 

atoms with high energies, so called suprathermal or “hot” atoms. If the energy of an atom is 

high enough, it can exceed the energy of the gravitational binding to the planet, and then the 

atom  is  lost  (e.g.,  Amerstorfer  et  al.,  2017).  The  reactions  can  include  various  chemical 

reactions, including dissociative recombination or charge exchange. Photochemically produced 

suprathermal atom escape can preferentially remove lighter isotopes. On Mars, photochemical 

processes lead to removal of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, and similar to the fractionation by ion 

pick-up, the fractionation is  driven by the diffusive separation of different  isotopes by mass 

above the homopause (e.g., Jakosky et al., 1994).  

Not all escape processes are equally efficient at causing mass fractionation. For example, 

hydrodynamic outflow is relatively inefficient at fractionating of elements and isotopes with a 

small mass difference (i.e., D/H…), while it can be efficient if a light species such as atomic 

hydrogen drags heavier ones, whereas Jeans escape is very efficient but much less efficient for 

the  total  atmospheric  escape.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  high-rate  loss  processes,  such  as 

hydrodynamic escape, are very efficient in removing the atmospheric gas, but are inefficient 

fractionators in case of light elements where it takes a long time to change the isotopic ratio. 

On the other hand, low-rate loss processes are efficient fractionators, but take a very long time 

to influence a large inventory.  

Impact erosion: early in the planet’s history, atmospheric gas can be removed by impacts 

Due to a large mass of gas removed simultaneously; this process is not an efficient fractionator 

of isotopes related elements in atmospheres and is discussed in more detail in the subsect. 5.3.  

5  Impact erosion of early crust, mantle and atmosphere 

17 

 
Understanding  impact  and  collision  processes  and  their  consequences  during  accreting 

planetary  embryos  and  protoplanets  is  a  vital  component  in  the  overall  picture,  since  those 

events  happened  during  all  stages  of  terrestrial  planet  formation.  The  currently  established 

picture distinguishes several main stages, where theoretical knowledge about the early phases 

from dust to planetary embryos is still limited and  various competing theories are discussed 

(e.g.  Raymond  et  al.  2014;  Johansen  and  Lambrechts,  2017;  Izidoro  and  Raymond,  2018; 

Lammer et al. 2019a; this issue). However, it is relatively well established that the final phase 

of accretion, lasting for  millions to several 10s of Myr is marked by giant collisions among 

planetary embryos and remaining planetesimals, which shape the bulk properties of eventually 

formed planets. 

A central aspect of collisional processes in an active planet formation environment is the 

deposition of large amounts of heat. Together with the release of gravitational energy during 

differentiation and from short-lived radioactive isotopes, this can lead to largescale melting of 

outer  silicate  layers,  with  the  result  of  local  or  even  global  magma  oceans.  Their  general 

evolution  and  particularly  their  solidification  time  are  strongly  coupled  to  the  overlying 

atmosphere, which can consist of primordial nebular gas and/or outgassed volatiles from the 

current or an earlier magma ocean phase itself. 

5.1 Impact related atmosphere erosion 

As  discussed  above,  growing  bodies  accrete  nebular  gas  once  they  become  sufficiently 

massive, where cores larger than one Earth-mass accrete an H2-dominated envelope that most 

likely remain during their whole lifetime (Johnstone et al., 2015; Owen and Wu, 2016), while 

protoplanets  below  0.5MEarth  probably  loose  most  of  their  primordial  atmosphere,  which  is 

largely boiled off after the surrounding gas dissipates and potentially replaced by an outgassed 

one later (Stökl et al., 2016). It is important to mention that existing work on the interplay of 

internal  and  external  (impact)  heating,  magma  ocean  and  (proto-)atmosphere  evolution  of 

growing  terrestrial  planets  has  focused  on  roughly  Earth-mass  objects,  even  though  smaller 

bodies – the size of planetary embryos and below – are the stepping stones on the way to fully 

grown planets.  

Studies on impact effects onto atmosphere and ocean-covered protoplanets were often based 

on  one-dimensional  hydrodynamic  codes  (Genda  and  Abe,  2003,  2005;  Inamdar  and 

Schlichting, 2016), analytical models in combination with such codes (Schlichting et al., 2015), 

and also 3-dimensional hydrocode simulations of impacts of small bodies (Shuvalov, 2009) up 

to head-on collisions in the Earth- to super-Earth mass range (Liu et al., 2015). An important 

18 

 
result is that smaller impactors are - per unit mass - much more efficient in eroding atmosphere 

than larger ones (e.g. Schlichting et al.,  2015; Schlichting and Mukhopadhyay, 2018, for an 

overview). The mass loss efficiency (the ratio of lost atmospheric to impactor mass) is largest 

for small bodies, e.g. in the kilometer range for current Earth, and decreases with mass by orders 

of magnitude up to the giant impact regime (∼ 1000 km bodies) This is mainly because for 

small impactors the majority of the energy is available for driving of atmosphere locally; above 

the tangent plane of the impact location, the gas can be entirely lost.

structure. Panel b: Atmospheric collision losses in percent of H2-envelope covered protoplanets caused

For impactors with energy deposition larger than what is required for ejecting all material 

above the tangent plane, considerable parts of their kinetic energy have to be used to drive a 

strong  shock  through  the  target  body  to  eject  atmosphere  globally,  once  the  shock-induced 

ground  velocity  is  sufficient  to  accelerate  atmosphere  components  to  escape  velocity.  The 

presence of oceans on the surface has been found to aid the escape of overlying atmosphere, 

due to their lower shock impedance compared to a solid surface (Genda and Abe, 2005).  In 

recent  3-dimensional  smoothed-particle  hydrodynamics  (SPH)  giant  impact  simulations, 

atmosphere  losses  of  ≈ 5 %  per  collision  for  Moon-mass/size,  and  ≈ 10-20  %  for  Mars-

mass/size  impactors  in  collisions  with  a  ≈ 0.5-0.75MEarth  protoplanet  with  primordial 

atmospheric mass fractions of ≥  0.001 have been obtained (Lammer et al., 2019). 

The impact scenarios in this study cover the full range of impact angles and common impact 

velocities from 1 to 2 × vesc. An SPH collision snapshot of a Moon-mass impactor that crashes 

into  an  H2-covered  protoplanet  with  0.5MEarth is  shown  in  panel  (a)  in  Fig. 4  (Burger  et  al., 

2018;  Lammer  et  al.,  2019).  Panel  (b)  in  Fig. 4  shows  eroded  primordial  H2-dominated 

atmospheres in percent from protoplanets with masses ≈  0.5 - 0.75MEarth caused by Moon-mars 

and Mars-mass impactors as a function of impact angle and escape velocity (Lammer et al., 

2019). The different results shown in Lammer et al. (2019) indicate that studying atmospheric 

losses caused by giant impacts only by assuming head-on scenarios (e.g. Liu et al., 2015) may 

be  insufficient  to  understand  the  full  diversity  and  efficiency  of  atmospheric  losses  by  such 

events.  These  results  confirm  that  -  like  for  small  bodies  -  even  in  the  giant  impact  regime 

lower-mass  bodies  are  more  efficient  (normalized  to  impacting  mass)  than  larger  ones  in 

eroding atmosphere (Schlichting et al., 2015; Schlichting and Mukhopadhyay, 2018). 

5.2 Collisional erosion of crust/mantle material by large impactors 

During  its  accretion  phase,  in  particular  during  the  so-called  giant  impact  phase,  a  growing 

protoplanet is expected to experience energetic collisions with other planetary embryos (e.g., 

Quintana et al., 2016). Such a collision can then remove part of the newly formed crust from 

the planet which will either re-accrete or be lost to space (Carter et al., 2018). This process will 

therefore  preferentially  remove  incompatible  lithophile  elements  from  the  growing  planet 

leading to a fractionation between siderophile and lithophile elements (O’Neill and Palme et 

al., 2008; O’Neill et al., 2019; this issue). While Fe/Mg or Fe/Si, of which Fe is siderophile and 

Mg and Si are lithophile, will be fractionated by collisional erosion, other ratios such as K/U, 

which are both lithophile elements, will not. This process could therefore account for the high 

20 

 
 
terrestrial Fe/Mg ratio of 2.1 ± 0.1 compared to the solar ratio of 1.9 ± 0.1 (O’Neill et al., 2008). 

Another ratio that was suggested to be fractionated by collisional erosion is Earth’s 142Nd/144Nd 

ratio (Jellinek and Jackson, 2015). Here, however, a more recent study found that 142Nd/144Nd 

might not have been fractionated at all (Bouvier and Boyet, 2016). 

Whether collisional erosion can account for the high terrestrial Fe/Mg ratio was numerically 

studied by Carter et al. (2015) and Bonsor et al. (2015). Even though they both conclude that 

collisional erosion can fractionate Earth’s Fe/Mg from a chondritic to the present-day terrestrial 

value, they also found that this fractionation can only be reached if Earth was an extreme case. 

The growing planetary embryos that exhibit a different range of core mass fractions through 

giant impacts must have had a significant dynamical excitation to finally create the present-day 

day Fe/Mg  ratio of Earth (Bonsor et  al., 2015;  Carter  et  al., 2015). A  more recent  study by 

Carter et al. (2018) found that a growing protoplanet on average can lose about one third of its 

crust through collisional erosion which in turn would lead to the loss of up to 20% of its heat 

producing elements if the crust does not re-accrete onto the planet. Such an alteration of the 

planetary heat budget might further also have implications on the habitability of a planet since 

this could strongly affect the evolution of tectonic activity (Jellinek and Jackson, 2015; O’Neill 

et al., 2019; this issue). 

Collisional erosion could further also have been important in view of Mercury’s high iron 

abundance,  as  was  recently  simulated  by  Chau  et  al.  (2018).  These  authors  found  that  an 

energetic impactor could alter the iron distribution within a planet by up to 25%. According to 

their  study,  Mercury’s  abnormally  high  abundance  of  iron  could  therefore  be  the  result  of 

multiple collisions. Another recent study by Clement et al. (2019), however, concludes that, 

even though planets with elevated core fractions were produced in 90% of their simulations 

through  the  fragmentation  of  collided  bodies,  there  is  only  a  probability  of  ≤  1%  to 

simultaneously reproduce Mercury and Venus after such an event. 

5.3 Elemental fractionation caused by large impact events 

To summarize the impact erosion processes, one finds two scenarios where large impactors 

will change the composition of a growing proto-planet. Both cases are illustrated in Fig. 4. If a 

proto-planet  accreted  >  0.5 MEarth  inside  the  disk,  elements  in  solar  abundance  and  magma 

ocean-related  outgassed  moderately  volatile  rock-forming  elements  and  noble  gases  will  be 

embedded as trace elements in a captured H2-dominated primordial atmosphere.  

As  illustrated  in  Fig. 5a  large  impactors  that  mainly  affect  the  atmosphere  can  then 

contribute to the fractionation of moderately volatile elements such as K and/or Mg compared 

21 

 
to U or Fe, which remain in the crust/mantle. If a large impactor crashes into the body, so that 

crustal /mantle material is also eroded (see Fig. 5b), then refractory elements (e.g., U, Th) will 

also be lost (e.g. Palme and O’Neill, 2003; see also O`Neill et al., 2019; this issue).  

Fig. 5. Illustration of the two impact related erosion scenarios. a) Impact erosion of atmospheres, and b) 
direct impacts and related erosion of crustal and mantle material. Impacts that mainly affect a primordial 
atmosphere  can  contribute  to  the  modification  of  ratios  between  moderately  volatile  rock-forming 
elements that can also be in a primordial atmosphere and refractory elements that remain in the surface, 
such as U or Th (panel a), while direct impacts can also erode crustal and mantle material (panel b).   

Impacts, however, will not fractionate isotopes of atmospheric noble gases (e.g. 36Ar, 38Ar, 

20Ne,  22Ne, etc.) if they only affect the atmosphere (Fig. 5a) but  contribute to a depletion of 

volatile elements from a planetary body. If impactors with different isotopic compositions and 

ratios are involved in the accretion of a protoplanet (Fig. 5b), noble gas isotope ratios, however, 

can be modified by their mixing with compositions, abundances and ratios of the impacting 

bodies as discussed in Sect. 6 Below we discuss atmospheric escape and fractionation of such 

elements  from  planetary  embryos,  which  experience  magma  oceans  and  therewith  related 

outgassing of volatile elements. 

6 Escape of rock-forming elements and volatiles from planetary embryos 

Terrestrial planets accrete mass by numerous collisions between small objects that accumulate 

to larger ones, including Moon and Mars-mass planetary embryos that accrete onto full planets 

(e.g., Johansen and Lambrechts, 2017; Izidoro and Raymond, 2018;  Lammer et al., this issue 

2019a).  Growing  planetesimals,  which  are  embedded  in  the  circumstellar  disk,  with  a  size 

between hundred to thousand kilometers develop global magma oceans, caused by the heating 

of short-lived radioactive elements, like 26Al (e.g., Lichtenberg et al., 2016; 2018; Young et al., 
22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2019), and mutual collisions (e.g., Safronov and Zvjagina, 1969; Wetherill, 1980; Tonks and 

Melosh, 1993). Schaefer and Fegley (2007) and Fegley et al. (2016) performed chemical kinetic 

and equilibrium calculations for modeling the chemistry of moderate volatile elements (e.g., K, 

Si,  Mg,  Fe, Ca, Al, Na,  S, P, Cl,  F)  released by  heating of different  types of carbonaceous, 

ordinary  and  enstatite  chondrites  as  a  function  of  temperature  and  pressure  of  early 

atmospheres. These studies yield significant amounts of major rock-forming and other volatile 

elements, such as Rb and Zn, and noble gases (Ar, Ne, etc.) in primordial and/or catastrophically 

outgassed steam atmospheres at high temperatures (1000-2500 K). 

When the disk dissipates, after a short but efficient boil-off phase (Owen and Wu, 2016; 

Lammer et al., 2018) the magma oceans of the former disk-embedded bodies solidify and steam 

atmospheres  are  catastrophically  outgassed  (see  Fig. 6).  Depending  on  the  redox  state  these 

catastrophically outgassed atmospheres contain H2, CO (reduced interior) and/or H2O and CO2 

(oxidized interior) (Nikolaou et al., 2019). The outgassed amount per element depends on the 

Fig. 6.  a)  Illustration  of  planetary  embryo  growth  due 
to  collisions  between  differentiated 
planetesimals/planetary  embryos.  The  red  areas  correspond  to  magma  from  which  various  elements 
evaporate and can be lost directly at bodies with masses ≤ MMoon (Benedikt et al., 2019; Young et al., 2019) 
and by dragging of hydrodynamically escaping H atoms dissociated either from H2O molecules originated 
from catastrophically outgassed steam atmospheres during magma ocean solidification (Benedikt et al., 
2019) or b) from remnants of captured H2-dominated nebula-based envelopes (Lammer et al., 2019). 

bulk  composition  of  a  particular  planetary  embryo  and  the  solidification  process  of  the 

mentioned magma ocean (e.g., Elkins-Tanton, 2008; 2012; Salvador et al., 2017; Nikolaou et 

al., 2019).  

23 

 
Recently, Benedikt et al. (2019) studied the losses of magma ocean-related catastrophically 

outgassed steam atmospheres and outgassed rock-forming elements as well as Ar and Ne noble 

gases from planetary embryos with masses between 1.0MMoon and 1.5MMars along the EUV-flux 

evolution tracks of slow and moderate/fast rotating young G-type stars (Tu et al., 2015; Güdel 

et al., 2019; this issue) at orbital distances between 0.5 – 1.5 AU.  

Based on studies from Wakita and Schmitt (1970), Right and Chabot (2011), and Elkins-

Tanton (2012), one can assume magma ocean depths for planetary embryos within the mass 

ranges mentioned above between 500 – 1000 km for surface temperatures of 1500 – 3000 K. 

Because of the low mass of planetary embryos and these high surface temperatures, according 

to 1D radiative-convective atmosphere models (Marcq, 2012; Marcq et al., 2017; Pluriel et al., 

2018), it was found that the steam atmosphere heights are increasing up to a few thousands of 

kilometers  (Benedikt  et  al.,  2019).  The  main  process,  which  is  dragging  heavier  atoms  into 

space,  is  the  EUV-driven  hydrodynamic  escape  of  H  atoms  from  these  extended  upper 

atmospheres, originating from dissociation of H2O at the 1 µbar (Guo, 2019) level.  

Fig. 7. Escape time t of steam atmospheres for a planetary embryo with a mass of 0.5MMars, various 
partial surface pressures of H2O/CO2 and surface temperatures of 1500 and 2000 K for a weakly 
active slowly rotating young G-type star in dependence of the orbital distance d. The solid dark 
blue line in each panel shows the steam atmosphere solidification time based on the study of Lebrun 
et al. (2013) (after Benedikt et al., 2019). 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For  planetary  embryos  with  masses  ≤ 1 MMoon  no  dense  silicate  atmosphere  or  steam 

atmosphere can build up (Hin et al., 2017; Benedikt et al., 2010; Young et al., 2019), the embryo 

will continuously lose outgassed elements very fast to space. Therefore, one can expect that 

these  bodies  will  be  strongly  depleted  in  volatiles,  noble  gases  and  outgassed  rock-forming 

elements.  

One should note that in the recent study by Young et al. (2019) it is assumed that hydrostatic 

conditions  for  an  outgassed  rock  vapour  atmosphere  above  a  magma  ocean  with  a  surface 

temperature  of  1830  K  on  a  planetary  embryo  with  half  of  the  mass  of  Pluto  builds  up. 

As discussed in Benedikt et al. (2019), under such extreme conditions where the ratio between 

the gravitational energy and the thermal energy (Jeans parameter) is < 6 (in the case of Young 

et al., 2019 the Jeans parameter at the surface is 1.38) it is impossible that an atmosphere can 

build  up  at  such  low  mass  and  hot  bodies.    In  such  cases,  direct  escape  of  outgassed  rock-

forming elements occurs unless there is a steady supply from the interior to compensate for 

these  fast  losses.  For  silicate  atmospheres,  this  means  that  the  entire  mantle  will  eventually 

depleted in the outgassed elements. The assumption of a hydrostatic equilibrium as assumed in 

the study of Young et al. (2019) is thus only justified for cases in which the Jeans parameter of 

the outgassed elements at the surface of an embryo exceed ≈ 6 (Erkaev et al., 2015; Volkov et 

al., 2011).  

According  to  Benedikt  et  al.  (2019)  more  massive  embryos  with  masses  larger  than  0.5 

Mars  masses  also  lose  outgassed  heavy  trace  elements  when  they  are  incorporated  into 

solidified  magma  ocean-related  steam  atmospheres.  As  long  as  steam  atmospheres  do  not 

condense and outgassed rock-forming elements reach the upper atmosphere they can also be 

lost by the dragging of escaping H atoms. Fig. 7 shows an example of escape times of magma 

ocean-related catastrophically outgassed steam atmospheres and embedded trace elements for 

a planetary embryo with a mass of 0.5MMars at various orbital distances, partial surface pressures 

of 50/5 (green), 100/10 (red), 150/30 (blue) bar H2O/CO2 and surface temperatures of 1500 K 

(solid  line)  and  2000 K  (dashed  line).  The  bold  blue  line  corresponds  to  the  condensation 

temperature of a steam atmosphere based on the results of Lebrun et al. (2013). As one can see 

in Fig. 7, depending on the partial pressure and surface temperature, embryos with a mass of 

0.5MMars can lose steam atmospheres at an orbital distance of 1 AU within the condensation 

time. For heavier planetary embryos of up to ≈ 1.5MMars almost all outgassed trace elements 

can  be  lost  together  with  the  escaping  steam  atmosphere  within  ≈  10  Myr  (Benedikt  et  al., 

25 

 
2019), which lies within the time frame of the formation of the first protocrust on Mars (Bouvier 

et al., 2018).  

This indicates that frequent smaller impactors (Maindl et al., 2015) keep shallow magma 

oceans molten most likely over longer time frames so that the steam  atmosphere can longer 

remain in vapour form compared to the modelled time scales given in Lebrun et al. (2013). A 

more active young Sun-like star leads to a shorter escape time for the whole steam atmosphere 

compared to the slow rotator as shown in Fig 7.  

Fig. 8. Escape related evolution of the K/U, Mg/U, Na/U, Si/Fe, Mg/Fe, Mg/Si,  20Ne/22Ne, 
36Ar/38Ar ratios and losses of Ar and Ne as a function of time of a 50 bar H2O and 5 bar CO2 
outgassed steam atmosphere from a planetary embryo with 0.5MMars at 1 AU. The embryo’s 
steam atmosphere is exposed to the EUV flux of a weakly active slowly rotating young Sun-
like star after the magma ocean solidification that is assumed to be at ≈ 5 Myr. About 75% of 
the  total  initial  amounts  of  the  elements  are  lost  more  or  less  within  1  Myr    with  surface 
temperatures corresponding to 1500 K (solid lines) and 2000 K (dashed lines). The lines end 
when the steam atmospheres are lost from the embryo. The ratios were calculated for mol/g 
and U and Fe assumed not to escape but remain at the body with their initial amounts (after 
Benedikt et al., 2019).  

Fig. 8  shows  an  example  of  the  remaining  amount  of  various  elements  on  a  planetary 

embryo with 0.5 MMars at 1 AU, with a magma ocean-related steam atmosphere partial surface 

pressure of 50 bar H2O and 5 bar CO2. If all outgassed elements escape, the particular volatiles 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are  depleted  by  ≈  75 %  within  the  planetary  embryo.  The  remaining  amount  of  Ne  and  Ar 

isotopes in mol/g and 20Ne/22Ne and 36Ar/38Ar ratios are also shown. One can see that on such 

low mass bodies the Ne and Ar isotopes only escape to space but do not fractionate due to the 

high loss rates. Isotope fractionation, however, between the vapour and melt of small planetary 

embryos could at least fractionate the isotopic ratios of Mg and Si at near-equilibrium (Young 

et al., 2019).  

It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  depletions  and  ratios  of  the  volatile  rock-forming 

elements of the larger planetary embryos with masses ≥  0.5 MMars most likely represent upper 

values. First, it is unclear whether 100 % of the outgassed elements will indeed be incorporated 

into  the  steam  atmosphere  or  if  a  fraction  remains  inside  the  magma  ocean.  Second,  the 

outgassed rock-forming elements have to overcome a bottleneck from the lower atmosphere to 

the upper atmosphere where they have to overcome a so-called cold-trap in the mesosphere; 

otherwise, they will reach the condensation temperature. 

 For noble gases such as Ne or Ar, however, the atmospheric cold-trap of larger bodies does 

not exist due to their low condensation temperatures. Because of this, it seems reasonable that 

large planetary embryos should be more depleted in noble gases (i.e., Ne and Ar) than in rock- 

forming elements such as K, Si, Mg, Fe, Ca, Al, Na, S, P, Cl, F due to their significantly higher 

condensation temperatures.   

In general, these studies also agree with the recent experimental and theoretical based results 

of Sossi and Fegley (2018) and Sossi et al. (2019), that atmospheric escape caused by one large 

evaporation  event  at  Earth  is  ineffective  in  fractionating  moderately  volatile  element 

abundances to an extend that match the observations. Instead, the present moderately volatile 

element abundance in terrestrial planets most likely reflects accretion from several lower-mass 

embryos where each of them experienced different degrees of volatilization. One can conclude 

from these recent studies that a late accretion of chondritic material via planetary embryos that 

underwent melting processes might therefore not necessarily lead to a volatile rich planet. 

7 Evolution of Earth’s and Venus’ Ar and Ne noble gas isotope  

and K/U bulk elemental ratios 

Chondritic meteorites have long been linked to the bulk composition of the silicate part of Solar 

System terrestrial planets (e.g. Taylor, 1964; Anders and Grevesse, 1989;  Javoy et al. 2010; 

Dauphas 2017; Schiller et al., 2018). Dauphas (2017) analyzed isotopes of lithophile (O, Ca, 

Ti, Nd), highly siderophile (Ru) and moderately siderophile (Cr, Ni and Mo) elements from 

Earth’s  mantle  and  found  that  they  record  different  accretion  stages.  According  to  analysed 
27 

 
isotope compositions by Dauphas (2017), the first 60 % of proto-Earth consisted of about 50 % 

enstatite-like and 5 % chondrite-like material, whereas all of the remaining accreted material 

consisted  of  enstatite-like  impactors.  According  to  Budde  et  al.  (2019)  most  isotopic 

compositions  can  also  be  explained  if  mixtures  of  carbonaceous  chondritic  and  non-

carbonaceous chondritic material composed the building blocks of the accreting Earth. On the 

other hand, the oxygen isotopic composition of the Earth is nearly identical to that of enstatite 

chondrite  meteorites.  Oxygen  is  the  most  abundant  element  in  rocks  and  one  of  the  most 

abundant element in Earth depending on the estimated FeO content in the mantle and the Fe 

content in the core. Unless the Earth has a large enstatite chondrite component, the oxygen-

isotopic composition and the iron content of the Earth cannot be matched (Dauphas, 2017). The 

Dauphas  (2017)  O-isotope  model  and  composition  hypothesis  agrees  also  with  the  two-

component models of Ringwood (1979), Wänke and Dreibus (1988) and Lodders (2000), which 

assume almost the same percentage of O-isotope related enstatite chondritic material.   

Recently,  Schiller  et  al.  (2018)  investigated  the  48Ca/44Ca  isotope  evolution  of  the 

composition of different Solar System objects such as Lunar and Martian meteorites, ordinary 

and carbonaceous chondrites, angrites, eucrites, ureilites, as well as very young chondrules from 

ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites and its role as a precursor element to rocky planets. The 

results of this study indicate that the 48Ca/44Ca composition of the earliest material in the inner 

disk originated from a ureilite-like composition and evolved to a terrestrial composition within 

the first million years  after the formation of the Sun. Calculated accretion rates of the inner 

protoplanetary disk inferred from the Ca isotope composition of the involved objects reveal that 

the bulk disk composition at ≈ 5-6 Myr after the formation of the Solar System consisted of a 

mixture of about 60 % ureilite-like and 40 % outer Solar System CI chondritic material (Schiller 

et al., 2018).  

In contrast to this, 36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne noble gases of the present Earth atmosphere and 

isotopes of water (D/H), and nitrogen (14N/15N) can also be reproduced by assuming a volatile 

content equivalent to a mixture of about 98 % non-chondritic dry material with a contribution 

of  about  2 %  undepleted  carbonaceous  CI-CM-like  material  (Marty,  2012).  Although,  the 

results for the proto-Earth obtained by Dauphas (2017) and Schiller et al. (2018) might seem to 

contradict the findings of Marty (2012) representing present Earth, it is not necessarily the case. 

As shown and discussed in Odert et al. (2018), Benedikt et al. (2019) and in Sect. 6, the building 

blocks  of  terrestrial  planets  were  most  likely  depleted  in  noble  gases  and  other  moderately 

volatile rock-forming elements. Additionally one should not forget that proto-Earth and Venus 

28 

 
underwent  different  evolutionary  processes  since  the  evaporation  of  the  disk,  including  the 

possible escape of a primordial atmosphere, magma oceans and impactors with  a depletion-

modified abundance of their composition. These processes certainly  played a crucial role in 

shaping  the  noble  gas  isotope,  elemental  and  volatile  evolution  of  these  planets  over  their 

history. 

Since  decades,  various  researchers  tried  to  model  the  compositional  evolution  of  early 

Venus and Earth by reproducing the observed isotope ratios of the non-radiogenic noble gases 

Ar and Ne in their atmospheres (e.g., Cameron, 1983; Pepin, 1991; 1997; Becker et al., 2003; 

Gillmann et al., 2009). For instance, Gillmann et al. (2009) studied the escape and fractionation 

of 36Ar/38Ar, and 20Ne/22Ne noble gas isotope ratios in Venus early atmosphere with a simple 

hydrodynamic escape model that is based on approaches and inputs provided by earlier studies 

of  Hunten  (1997),  Kasting  and  Pollack  (1983),  Zahnle,  and  Kasting  (1986)  and  Chassefière 

(1996a; 1996b; 1997).  

Fig. 10. Illustration of main processes and scenarios involved in the reproduction attempts of 
present day atmospheric 36Ar, 38Ar, 20Ne, 22Ne, noble gas isotope ratios and bulk K/U ratios on 
Venus and Earth by Lammer et al. (2019). 

In this approach Gillmann et al. (2009) introduced a factor η = ε f + Φsw / ΦEUV, that depends 

on  the  heating  efficiency  ε  of  the  solar  EUV  flux  ΦEUV,  generally  assumed  to  be  ≈ 15 % 

(Chassefière,  1996b;  Shematovich  et  al.,  2014;  Lammer  et  al.,  2014),  a  geometrical 

amplification factor f related to the EUV heated and extended upper atmosphere and the relative 

contribution Φsw of the solar wind energy deposition to the total energy deposition (solar wind 

+ EUV) near the exobase level. Since at the time of this study only very rough estimates existed 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on  the  young  Sun’s  activity  evolution,  Gillmann  et  al.  (2009)  assumed  η  values  between 

0.3 – 20.  The  introduced  geometrical  amplification  factor  f  was  also  based  on  arbitrary 

assumptions within a range of 4 – 8, since no upper atmosphere structures have been modelled 

in detail in these pioneering but simplified models.  

Fig. 9  shows  resulting  36Ar/38Ar  and  20Ne/22Ne  isotope  fractionation  patterns  in  Venus 

atmosphere, obtained by the simple model approaches presented in Gillmann et al. (2009). One 

can see that their obtained evolutionary scenarios are  consistent within the present  error bar 

ranges. Since no upper atmosphere structure and temperature profiles were modelled in their 

approach these authors assumed various average thermospheric temperatures between 300 and 

2000 K.  For  high  thermospheric  temperatures  > 1000 K,  Gillman  et  al.  (2009)  obtained  too 

large isotopic fractionations, because the densities of Ne and Ar and their escape fluxes are too 

large in their model approach.  One can also see that for average  thermosphere temperatures 

< 400 K,  Ne  is  not  fractionated  enough  to  fit  the  present  fractionation  value  due  to  its  low

abundance at the escape level. One should also note that the amount of hydrogen necessary to 

obtain the fractionation results for assumed η values of 0.6 (Fig. 9a) and 1.2 (Fig. 9b) contained 

6 – 14 terrestrial oceans (TO) and 30 – 40 TOs, respectively (Gillmann et al., 2009).  

More recently, Lichtenegger et al. (2016) studied the expected relative contribution Φsw of 

the solar wind energy deposition on early Venus, by assuming that the young Sun was either a 

weak or a moderately active young G star. These authors assumed a hydrogen-dominated upper 

atmosphere and modelled the precipitation of energetic hydrogen atoms (ENAs) that originate 

30 

 
due  to  charge  exchange  between  the  planet’s  extended  exosphere  and  solar  wind  protons 

(Chassefière, 1996b; 1997). Chassefière (1997) and Gillmann et al. (2009) expected that these 

ENAs deposit a huge amount of energy into the upper atmosphere and as a result enhance the 

H  escape  rate  that  influenced  the  noble  gas  fractionation.  According  to  Lichtenegger  et  al. 

(2016),  however,  ENAs  deposit  their  energy  and  heat  mainly  above  the  main  EUV  energy 

deposition layer. Although these particles modify the thermal structure of the upper atmosphere, 

the enhancement of the thermal escape rates caused by ENAs remains negligible (Lichtenegger 

et al., 2016). Since several pioneering studies including that of Cameron (1983), Pepin (1991) 

and Gillmann et al. (2009) lacked knowledge on the X-ray and EUV evolution of the young 

Sun/stars,  magma  ocean  physics  or  impact  studies,  assumed  arbitrarily  reservoirs  of  H2-

molecules from primordial atmospheres and/or catastrophically outgassed H2O inventories, one 

can  consider  that  these  arbitrarily  chosen  assumptions  are  insufficiently  accurate  and  hence 

outdated.  

Recently, Odert et al. (2018) tried to reproduce the 36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne isotope ratios 

of  Venus’  atmosphere  within  a  more  realistic  parameter  space  and  found  that  EUV-driven 

hydrodynamic  escape  of  an  H2-envelope  that  remained  around  proto-Venus  after  the  disk 

evaporated can reproduce the observed atmospheric Ne and Ar isotope ratios within their large 

error  bars.  In  the  study  of  these  authors  the  EUV  activity  evolution  of  the  young  Sun 

corresponded to a slowly to moderately rotating young Sun (Tu et al., 2015; Lammer et al., 

2019b). These findings stimulated Lammer et al. (2019b) to apply more complex models to 

figure out whether one can reproduce the measured atmospheric 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne 

noble gas isotope ratios and bulk planet K/U elemental ratios of Earth and Venus to constrain 

their early evolution. 

That a fraction of K compared to its initial composition was lost during accretion can be 

seen in the K/U ratio of each planet (e.g. ≈ 13 800 for the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) (Arevalo et 

al., 2009; Lodders et al., 2009), and ≈ 7 000 on Venus’ surface (Davis et al., 2005), compared 

to  a  K/U  abundance  ratio  of  ≈ 64 650  in  the  solar  photosphere  (Lodders  et  al.,  2009)  and 

≈ 68 930  in  unprocessed  chondrites  (Lodders  et  al.,  2009).  This  study,  for  the  first  time, 

additionally included the moderately volatile rock-forming element K which is released at high 

temperatures (≈ 1500 – 2500 K) from  magma oceans that form below primordial atmospheres 

(Schaefer and Fegley, 2010; Fegley et al., 2016; see also O’Neill et al., this issue 2019).  

The  model  efforts  carried  out  in  Lammer  et  al.  (2019b)  are  illustrated  in  Fig. 10  and 

summarized below:

assumed compositions – i.e., ureilite (UR), enstatite (EN), carbonaceous chondrites 

(CC); see Fig. 10 are included into the remaining atmosphere.

ratios. χ2 values that are larger than 5.0 indicate that at least one element is not within the error bars 
of today’s measurements and scenarios with values larger than 30 show distinct deviations (after 
Lammer et al., 2019).

evolution code that drag heavier trace elements (Zahnle, and Kasting, 1986; Odert 

et al., 2018) out of the gravity field of accreting proto-planets are applied for various 

expected EUV-flux scenarios from slow to moderate and fast rotating young Sun 

evolution scenarios.  

•  Atmospheric  mass  loss  of  the  H2-envelope  caused  by  Moon-  to  Mars-mass 

impactors (Sect.  5) is  considered  additionally  to  the EUV-driven thermal escape. 

Since the masses of these impactors, which are assumed to be admixtures of CC, 

UR, EN, are added to the protoplanetary mass, they are also altering the 36Ar, 38Ar, 

20Ne,  22Ne,  and  K  content  of  proto-Earth  and  Venus,  which  has  to  be  taken  into 

account.

evolution is also included in the study.  

The illustrations in Fig. 10 show the two main phases and processes that are included in the 

recent model simulation attempts of Lammer et al. (2019b) for reproducing proto-Venus’ and 

Earth’s  36Ar,  38Ar,  20Ne,  22Ne, K/U ratios. Fig. 11 shows the statistical outcome of modelled 

proto-Earth and proto-Venus masses at the end of the disk lifetime (3 – 5 Myr) by Lammer et 

al. (2019). The white areas illustrate the parameter space of EUV flux and protoplanetary mass 

in which the 36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne noble gas isotope ratios and bulk planet K/U elemental 

ratios  were  successfully  reproduced  for  particular  compositions  on  both  planets  within  their 

error bars.

One can see that the present day ratios can be reproduced if proto-Earth and Venus were 

released from the disk between 3 – 5 Myr with masses of about 0.53 – 0.58MEarth and 0.68 –

0.81MEarth,  respectively,  if  the  young  Sun  followed  an  EUV  flux  evolution  path  between  a 

slowly and moderately rotating young G-type star.  

Fig. 12  shows  evolution  scenarios  for  early  Earth  with  an  initial  protoplanetary  mass  of 

0.55 MEarth at the end of the disk at ≈ 4 Myr (Bollard et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017) orbiting a 

young  Sun  that  evolves  along  an  EUV  activity  that  corresponds  to  an  intermediate  rotating 

young G-type star, with a post-H2-envelope impactor composition of ≈ 95 % EN and ≈ 5 % CC 

(Dauphas, 2017; solid lines), 100 % CC (Schiller et al., 2018; dotted lines) and 98 % EC and 

2% CC (Marty, 2012; dashed lines). Today’s atmospheric  36Ar/22Ne ratio of ≈ 18.8 could be 

best reproduced by the model methods applied in Lammer et al. (2019) for the Dauphas and 

Schiller  scenarios  but  with  different  assumed  growth  rates  and  depletions  of  the  post-H2-

envelope  impactors.  A  significant  difference  in  these  production  attempts  is  the  amount  of 

volatile rich CCs. The more CCs are delivered to the growing protoplanet the faster it has to 

grow  so  that  the  volatile  elements  can  escape  together  with  the  captured  primordial  H2-

dominated  atmosphere.  If  proto-Earth  captured  such  a  tiny  primordial  atmosphere,  initial 

composition  suggested  by  Marty  (2012)  cannot  reproduce  Earth’s  present  atmospheric 

36Ar/22Ne ratio. However, if proto-Earth accreted less mass so that no primordial atmosphere 

remained after disk dispersal the composition derived in Marty (2012) cannot be excluded. Due 

to this, the reproduction of the present day atmospheric Ar and Ne isotope ratios only yields an 

upper limit for the mass of the proto-Earth (≤ 0.58 MEarth) at the time when the disk evaporated.  

According  to  the  resent  work  of  Burkhardt  et  al.  (2019)  an  analysis  of  measured  Ti  and  Sr 

isotopic compositions of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) from the Allende CV3 chondrite indicate 

that CAI-like material was the carrier of the nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies in most minor 

and  trace  elements.  These  authors  found  that  a  variable  admixing  of  CAI-like  refractory 

material to an average inner solar nebula component could explain the planetaryscale Ti and Sr 

isotope anomalies and the elemental and isotopic difference between noncarbonaceous (NC) 

and  carbonaceous  (CC)  nebular  reservoirs  for  these  elements.  If  this  is  the  case,  then  the 

differences between meteorites and Earth may simply reflect the timing or spatial location for 

adding this CAI-like material to the solar nebula. The findings by Lammer et al. (2019) that the 

post-H2-envelope impactors should have also be at least partially related to the CC-reservoir 

agrees also  with the dating of terrestrial planet building blocks from CAIs, from which it is 

34 

 
inferred that CCs finished their accretion at times around ≈ 3 – 4 Myr after the formation of the 

Solar System (Kruijer et al, 2017).

36Ar/38Ar and 20Ne/22Ne isotope and K/U surface ratios at Venus. A final accreted Venus at the time 
when  the  disk  evaporated  can  reproduce  the  present  observations  if  the  captured  primordial  H2-
dominated atmosphere is exposed to a slowly to less than moderately rotating young Sun (solid lines). 
All ratios are normalized to the initial ratio. A lower mass proto-Venus with a mass of about 0.86MVenus 
over fractionates these noble gas isotopes and yields lower K/U ratios as measured by Venera 8, 9, 10, 
and Vega 1 and 2 (after Lammer et al., 2019).  

Fig. 13  shows  a  best-case  evolution  scenario  obtained  by  Lammer  et  al.  (2019)  that  can 

reproduce the present atmospheric  36Ar/38Ar,  20Ne/22Ne and measured surface K/U ratios on 

Venus by assuming a similar initial composition and the same young Sun EUV flux evolution 

track as assumed for the successful reproduction of the elements on Earth in Fig. 12. In this 

particular scenario, proto-Venus accreted its whole mass during the disk lifetime and was 

released from the disk at ≈ 4 Myr with a H2-dominated primordial atmosphere with a hydrogen 

partial pressure of ≈ 1000 bar. The escaping H atoms dragged away the heavier trace species 

and fractionated  36Ar/38Ar,  20Ne/22Ne from the initially solar-dominated ratios to the ones in 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
today’s  Venus’  atmosphere  (Lammer  et  al.,  2019).  Besides  the  noble  gas  isotope  ratios,  the 

corresponding K/U ratio lies slightly above Vega 1, 2 and Venera 9, 10 data (Davis et al., 2005) 

but  within  the  range  of  the  Venera 8  landing  site  (Basilevsky,  1997;  Abdrakhimov  and 

Basilevsky, 2002). The dashed lines in Fig. 12 show an example modelled by Lammer et al. 

(2019) where these authors failed to reproduce the present-day ratios for Venus. In this failed 

attempt  a  less  massive  proto-Venus  with  about  0.86 MVenus  (0.69 MEarth)  leads  to  an  under 

fractionation of the Ar, Ne isotope and K/U ratios. 

Compared to both large terrestrial planets in the Solar System, the evolution for the lower 

mass planet Mars was different and one cannot constrain it in a similar way as in the case of 

Venus and Earth. Mars’ mass is too low to capture a relevant H2-envelope during the phase the 

small planet grew within the gas disk. Noble gases could have also been lost and dragged away 

by the escaping H atoms as long as hydrogen, which originated from solidified magma ocean-

related outgassed steam  atmospheres,  dominated  the upper atmosphere (Pepin, 1994;  2002). 

Afterwards ionization related fractionation through thermal and non-thermal escape (i.e., ion 

pick  up,  sputtering,  dissociative  recombination)  of  the  planet’s  CO2  atmosphere  resulted  in 

today’s observed Ar, Ne and N isotopic compositions (e.g., Jakosky et al., 1994; Hutchins and 

Jakosky, 1996; Carr, 1999).  In the next section, the isotopic fractionation and escape of the 

Martian atmosphere and initial water inventory are discussed.  

8 Isotopic fractionation as a constraint on the atmospheric evolution and 

water inventory on Mars 

Small gravity and absence of an intrinsic magnetic field allow efficient atmospheric escape 

from Mars induced by the solar EUV radiation and the solar wind. Its isotopic compositions 

show heavy-isotope enrichment in hydrogen (D/H), carbon (13C/12C), nitrogen (15N/14N), and 

noble  gases  (22Ne/20Ne,  38Ar/36Ar,  and  non-radiogenic  xenon  isotopes)  except  krypton 

compared  to  their  possible  origins  (nebula  gas,  chondrites,  and  comets),  as  an  outcome  of 

atmospheric escape. As mentioned above, noble gases are particularly useful to constrain the 

atmospheric evolution since they are mostly partitioned into the atmosphere and do not form 

molecules so that the escape processes are limited to hydrodynamic escape and to atmospheric 

sputtering for lower mass bodies without magnetospheres (e.g., Pepin, 1991; 1994; Jakosky et 

al.,  1994).  Nitrogen  behaves  similarly  to  noble  gases  as  it  is  chiefly  partitioned  into  the 

atmosphere  but  ion-molecule  photochemical  reactions  also  induce  atmospheric  escape  (e.g., 

Fox and Dalgarno, 1983; Fox 1993ab; Fox and Hác, 1999; see also Avice and Marty 2019; this 

issue).  Carbon  is  partitioned  into  multiple  reservoirs  -  the  atmosphere,  carbonate,  organic 

36 

 
compounds,  CO2/CH4-clathrate,  and  CO2  ice  (e.g.,  Kurahashi-Nakamura  and  Tajika,  2006; 

Longhi,  2006;  Hu  et  al.,  2015;  Wray  et  al.,  2016)  so  that  the  isotopic  fractionation  is  more 

complicated. 

As briefly discussed in  Sect. 4 fractionation mechanisms include diffusive separation by 

mass between the homopause and exobase (e.g., McElroy and Yung, 1976; Jakosky et al., 1994; 

2017). The number densities of photochemically long-lived atmospheric species follow their 

own scale height above the homopause. As the escape processes remove atoms, molecules, and 

ions  from  the  vicinity  of  the  exobase,  the  diffusive  separation  causes  mass-dependent 

fractionation. Since atmospheric sputtering is so energetic that mass-dependent fractionation in 

the  removal  process  itself  is  limited  (Johanson,  1992),  the  isotopic  fractionation  through 

sputtering is chiefly determined by the diffusive separation (Jakosky et al., 1994). 

The diffusive separation between the homopause and exobase was recently probed with the 

help of the MAVEN spacecraft (Jakosky et al., 2017; Slipski et al., 2018). Measurements of the 

N2/40Ar ratio indicated substantial variations at the homopause (≈ 60 – 140 km) and exobase 

(≈ 140 – 200  km)  altitudes.  This  represents  an  unresolved  combination  of  real  geophysical 

variations  with  time  and  location  but  confirms  the  concept  of  elemental  and  isotopic 

fractionation.  Photochemical  processes  fractionate  isotopic  ratios  due  to  the  difference  in 

reaction  rates  between  isotopic  species.  Both  photodissociation  of  CO  and  dissociative 

recombination of CO+ and CO2

+ could induce preferential loss of 12C rather than 13C (Fox and 

Hác, 1999; Hu et al., 2015). Dissociative recombination of N2

+ causes isotopic fractionation 

between 14N and 15N (Wallis, 1989; Fox and Hác, 1997; Manning et al., 2008). 

8.1 Isotopic compositions of the present-day Martian atmosphere 

The  observed 

isotopic  compositions  of  N2,  Ne,  and  of 

the  non-radiogenic  Ar 

(δ15N = 572 ± 82 ‰, 20Ne/22Ne = 10.1 ± 0.7, and  36Ar/38Ar = 4.2 ± 0.1, Pepin, 1991; Wong et 

al.,  2013;  Atreya  et  al.,  2013)  are  well  described  by  the  steady  state  where  the  loss  via 

atmospheric escape balances the supply via, for example, volcanic outgassing (Fig. 14), and is 

given by I/I0 = 1/f, where I, I0, and f are the isotope ratio in the atmosphere, the isotope ratio of 

the source, and the net fractionation factor. 

The estimated lifetimes of N (via sputtering and photochemical escape) and Ne (via sputtering) 

are shorter than one billion years, supporting the hypothesis of steady state (Jakosky et al., 1994; 

Manning et al., 2008; Kurokawa et al., 2018). The lifetime of Ar is comparable to the age of 

Mars (Jakosky et al., 1994), but its isotopic ratio being close to the value of steady state suggests 

37 

 
that the lifetime was shorter on earlier time (Kurokawa et al., 2018). Being close to the steady 

state suggests 

• 

the model for their isotopic fractionation is valid, and 

• 

the present-day isotopic compositions do not reflect the earlier period (i.e. before ≈ 4 

billion years ago (Ga)). 

Fig. 14. Isotope ratios of volatile elements in present-day Martian atmosphere with respect to 
their  source  isotope  ratio  (data  points).  We  assumed  the  source  values  of  Martian  mantle 
informed from Martian meteorites for C and N (Wright et al. 1992; Mathew and Marti 2001), 
and  solar  abundances  for  noble  gases  (Pepin  1991;  Pepin  et  al.  2012).  Data  for  Martian 
atmosphere are from Mahaffy et al. (2013), Pepin (1991), Wong et al. (2013), Atreya et al. 
(2013), Conrad et al. (2016). The expected steady state values are shown as horizontal ranges. 
We  assumed  the  upper  atmospheric  temperature  to  be  200  K  and  the  homopause-exobase 
separation  60-80  km  to  calculate  the  fractionation  factor  for  the  diffusive  separation.  We 
adopted  additional  fractionation  for  photochemical  escape  of  C  and  N,  f = 0.62  and  0.74, 
respectively (Manning et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2015). 

The observed 13C/12C ratio being smaller than the ratio expected from the steady state with 

sputtering and/or photochemical escape (Fig. 14) suggests that atmospheric escape is not the 

only sink of an ancient dense atmosphere. Other sinks include carbonate precipitation (Hu et 

al.,  2015;  Wray  et  al.,  2016),  organic  compounds  deposition,  and  CO2-clathrate  formation 

following the basal melting of CO2-ice caps (Longhi, 2006; Kurahashi-Nakamura and Tajika, 

2006). Hu et al. (2015) considered atmospheric escape, carbonate precipitation, and concluded 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that  Mars  at  ≈ 3.8 Ga  had  an  atmospheric  pressure  ≤1 bar.  Based  on  an  experimental  study 

(Eiler et al., 2000), part of the atmospheric CO2 may convert into CO2 ice without significant 

isotopic fractionation (δ13Cice-vapor <  -0.4 ‰ at 135 K). Considering additional sinks may allow 

a denser atmosphere. 

The isotopic composition of Xe is also less  fractionated compared to the value expected 

from  the  steady  state  with  atmospheric  sputtering.  It  suggests  that  the  present-day  Xe  is  a 

remnant  of  early  hydrodynamic  loss  (Pepin,  1994)  or  a  result  of  ionization-induced  escape 

(Zahnle et al., 2019; see also Avice and Marty, 2019; this issue).  Ionization-induced escape 

can lead to high Xe+ escape rates, while the escape of other heavy noble gases such as the hardly 

ionizable Kr is not significant.  

Fig. 15. Illustration of the cosmic ray-related surface chemistry that takes place in the 
Martian  regolith,  as  an  explanation  why  particular  Xe  and  Kr  isotopes  are  more 
abundant in the atmosphere than expected (Conrad et al., 2016) (NASA/GSFC/JPL-
Caltech). 

Furthermore,  as  illustrated  in  Fig. 15,  atmosphere-surface  interaction  processes  in 

combination with cosmic ray exposure and its related chemistry in the Martian surface can also 

contribute to an enhancement of some of the Xe and Kr isotopes in the Martian atmosphere 

(Conrad et  al.,  2016). Because of the present  thin Martian atmosphere, galactic cosmic rays 

penetrate into the surface material. According to these authors, if cosmic rays hit a barium (Ba) 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
atom, Ba can lose neutrons. Xe atoms can catch some of those neutrons to form the isotopes 

124Xe and 126Xe. 

In  a  similar  way,  Br  can  lose  neutrons  to  Kr,  leading  to  the  formation  of  80Kr  and  82Kr 

isotopes.  Impacts  and  abrasion  allow  that  these  isotopes  enter  the  atmosphere,  where  they 

underwent escape by impact erosion. 

8.2 Hydrodynamic escape from early Mars 

Models of the upper atmosphere have shown that hydrodynamic escape prohibits early Mars 

from developing a stable atmosphere (Tian et al., 2009; Erkaev et al., 2014; Odert et al., 2018). 

The primordial H2/He atmosphere originated from solar nebula (Pepin 1991, 1994; Stökl et al., 

2015; 2016; Saito and Kuramoto, 2018) but was lost due to a short and efficient boil-off phase 

during disk dispersal (Lammer et al., 2018). This was followed by a catastrophically outgassed 

steam atmosphere during the solidification of a magma ocean (Elkins-Tanton, 2008; Lebrun et 

al., 2013; Erkaev et al., 2014) that has been lost early on, and a secondary atmosphere later from 

volcanic outgassing (Lammer et al., 2013). 

Hydrodynamic  escape  involves  mass-dependent  elemental  and  isotopic  fractionation: 

heavier species are bound by the gravity more strongly and enrich in the remaining atmosphere 

(e.g., Hunten et al., 1987; Pepin, 1991; 1994; Odert et al., 2018). The isotopic compositions of 

trapped  non-radiogenic  Xe  in  Martian  meteorites  Allan  Hills  84001  (ALH84001)  formed 

4.1 Ga  and  North  West  Africa  7034  (NWA7034)  formed  4.4 Ga  are  indistinguishable  from 

current atmospheric Xe (Cassata, 2017; see also Avice and Marty; this issue 2019), suggesting 

that the fractionation has completed before 4.4 Ga. If atmospheric Xe fractionated before 4.4 

Ga and was later influenced by impact erosion and replenishment through time (de Niem et al., 

2012;  Kurokawa  et  al.,  2018;  Sakuraba  et  al.,  2019),  atmospheric  escape  of  Xe  in  the  later 

period  via  a  photo-ionized  hydrogen  wind  (Zahnle  et  al.,  2019)  might  compensate  the 

replenishment.  

8.3 Atmospheric evolution after the build-up of a secondary atmosphere 

Since  except  Xe  the  present-day  isotopic  compositions  do  not  probe  the  early  atmospheric 

history, Kurokawa  et  al. (2018)  utilized the isotopic compositions in  the atmosphere 4.1 Ga 

recorded  in  ALH84001  (Mathew  and  Marti,  2001).  While  a  dense  atmosphere  preserves 

primitive isotopic compositions  in  their model,  a thin atmosphere on early Mars is  severely 

influenced by stochastic impact events and following escape-induced fractionation (Fig. 16). 

40 

 
Though the timing when Mars started to build up a stable atmosphere depends on the initial 

spin rate and related activity of the Sun (Tu et al., 2015) as well as on the volcanic outgassing 

activity on early Mars (Amerstorfer et al., 2017; Lammer et al., 2018), the less fractionated N 

(δ15N = 7‰)  and  Ar  (36Ar/38Ar >  5.0)  recorded  in  the  ALH84001  meteorite  (Mathew  and 

Marti,  2001)  which  formed  at  4.1 Ga  (Lapen  et  al.,  2010)  suggest  that  a  dense  atmosphere 

whose pressure was >  0.5 bar has already existed at the time (Kurokawa et al., 2018).

Ne,  and  (d)  Ar  isotope  ratios  (modified  after  Kurokawa  et  al.,  2018).  Three  cases  are  shown:  the 
atmosphere has been dense for 4.5 Gas (black), the atmosphere becomes thin after 4.1 Ga (blue), and 
the atmosphere becomes thin before 4.1 Ga (green). Data points in blue show the average value in the 
cases where the atmosphere collapsed at some point. Data points in yellow are the value of Martian 
atmosphere (Wong et al., 2013; Pepin, 1991; Atreya et al., 2013; Mathew and Marti, 2001). 

Other geochemical and geological estimates of paleo-pressure also point to a moderately 

dense atmosphere whose pressure is comparable to or slightly ≤1 bar (Kite 2019 and references 

therein). Elevated radiogenic Ar (40Ar/36Ar) and Xe (129Xe/132Xe) ratios recorded in ALH84001 

(Cassata et al., 2010; Cassata 2017) are consistent with the Martian atmosphere originating at 

≈ 4.1 Ga from late outgassing.

8.4 Loss of water on Mars 

The D/H ratio recorded in ALH84001 (Boctor et al., 2003; Greenwood et al., 2008; Usui 

et al., 2017) is in the range of δD = 500 – 3000 ‰, which means that more than 1/3 of the 

surface water could have been lost at 4.1 Ga (Fig. 16). The surface water has experienced further 

loss to reach δD = 5000 – 6000 ‰ (Usui et al., 2012; Kurokawa et al., 2014; Mahaffy et al., 2014; 

Villanueva et al., 2015). An intermediate D/H ratio (δD = 1000 – 2000 ‰) recorded in impact glasses 

in Martian meteorites suggests that the majority of near-surface water might have been stored as 

subsurface ice isolated from the atmosphere (Usui et al., 2015; Kurokawa et al., 2016; Grimm et al., 

2017).  

On  the  other  hand,  if  one  assume  for  a  Noachean  ocean  volume  of  about  500 m  global 

equivalent layer (GEL) or 0.05 times the terrestrial ocean mass (MTO) (Di Ahille and Hynek, 

2010), the water loss before 4.1 Ga is > 160 m GEL, which might exceed the integrated oxygen 

escape (Jakosky et al., 2018). This imbalance between H and O escape drives the oxidation of 

the Martian surface environment (Lammer et al., 2003a; Zahnle et al., 2008). 

Fig. 17.  Evolution of  D/H (upper  panel) and  water volume (lower panel)  on Mars  (modified after 
Kurokawa et al. 2014, 2016; Usui et al., 2017). Data for D/H are from Usui et al. (2012, 2015, 2017), 
Boctor et al. (2003), Greenwood et al. (2008), Webster et al. (2013), Mahaffy et al. (2015), Villanueva 
et al. (2015), Krasnopolsky (2015), and Aoki et al. (2015). Water volume was computed by assuming 
Rayleigh fractionation with f = 0. 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That Mars lost large amounts of water was also suggested by Lammer et al. (2003b), who 

estimated the present and past H2O-ice reservoirs, which are and were in exchange with the 

atmosphere, by using the observed D/H ratio in the atmospheric water vapour, measured D/H 

ratios in Martian SNC meteorites and D/H isotope ratios based on a study regarding asteroid 

and cometary water delivery to early Mars by Lunine et al. (2003). 

These authors estimated the present H2O-ice reservoir to be equivalent to about 11 – 27 m 

GEL.  From  this  obtained  range,  depending  on  atmospheric  escape  of  D  and  H  a  reservoir 

exchangeable with the atmosphere on Mars 3.5 Ga equivalent to a global ocean with a thickness 

of between ≈  17 to 61 m was found. If one uses these estimated water reservoirs 3.5 Ga ago, 

Lammer et al. (2003b) found water reservoirs affected by isotopic fractionation equivalent to a 

global ocean with a depth of between 97 - 115 m if 1.2 times the terrestrial sea water ratio was 

the initial isotope ratio in Mars’ H2O 4.5 Ga as (Lunine et al., 2003). The difference with respect 

to  the  initial  volume  of  about  0.05 MTO  (Di  Ahille  and  Hynek,  2010)  may  have  escaped 

unfractionated to space between 3.5 - 4.5 Ga and/or partly stored in the subsurface (Orosei et 

al. 2018) (see also Fig. 17).  

8. 5 Redox state of the Martian atmosphere in relation to the atmospheric escape 

The preferential  loss of hydrogen into  space causes the oxidation  of the Martian surface 

(e.g. Lammer et al., 2003a). Additionally, carbon escape may have dominated against oxygen 

escape on early Mars (Tian et al., 2009; Amerstorfer et al., 2017) which may have also oxidized 

Mars’ surface. If this is the case, the redox state of the early Martian atmosphere could be more 

reducing than modern Mars. Thus, it is worth considering the possibility of an early reducing 

Martian atmosphere. 

First, the outgassing composition of presumably early Martian volcanos could have been 

more reducing than Earth’s since the oxygen fugacity of the Martian mantle could be up to 3 

log-units  lower  than  of  the  terrestrial  mantle  and  possibly  close  to  the  IW-buffer  especially 

during its early period (Wadhwa, 2001; Herd et al., 2002; Righter et al., 2008; McSween et al., 

2009). When  assuming  a low oxygen fugacity (log fO2 = IW+1), the  outgassing  composition 

should be roughly H2 : H2O :  CO : CO2 = 10 : 1 : 1 : 1 (Zolotov, 2003), which is much more 

reducing than Earth’s present volcanic flux. Although the oxygen fugacity of the Martian crust 

may vary and could be higher than in the mantle (Wadhwa, 2001), the Martian basaltic volatiles 

could be dominated by H2 and CO relative to CO2 based on a thermodynamic calculation of 

Gaillard  and  Scaillet  (2014).  Given  the  H2-rich  volcanic  flux,  the  early  Martian  atmosphere 

should have been very reducing and possibly rich in CO (Sholes et al., 2017). This is due to 

43 

 
CO2 continuously being photolyzed into CO, whereas the oxidation of CO back into CO2 is not 

efficient if the volcanic flux provides sufficient reducing agents into the atmosphere. This might 

then lead to a CO-runaway (Yung and DeMore, 1998; Zahnle et al., 2008). 

The  reducing  early  Martian  atmosphere  may  provide  a  solution  to  explain  why  the 

atmospheric  CO2  of  Mars  (δ13CPDB = +46 ± 4‰;  Webster  et  al.,  2013)  is  so  enriched  in  13C 

compared to that of the Martian mantle (δ13CPDB = -25 ± 5‰; Wright  et  al., 1992). Galimov 

(2000) originally proposed that CO2 could have been a minor component in the early Martian 

atmosphere as compared with CH4 or CO from a thermodynamic point of view. CH4 and CO 

are  depleted  in  13C  and  preferentially  escaped  into  space,  whereas  the  13C-enriched  CO2  is 

ultimately  deposited  as  carbonate.  Also,  as  mentioned  above,  Hu  et  al.  (2015)  argue  that 

photodissociation of CO may significantly induce preferential loss of 13C. 

In these scenarios, the atmospheric 13C-enrichment is caused by preferential escape of 13C 

into space though time. Based on the isotopic studies of carbonate globules in ALH84001 (Eiler 

et  al.,  2002;  Halvey  et  al.,  2011),  the  enrichment  in  13C  may  have  possibly  occurred  before 

3.9 Ga, when the geomagnetic field may have still existed and according to Lillis et al., (2013) 

prohibited carbon escape into space via pick-up-ion sputtering induced by the solar wind. On 

the other hand, C atoms most likely escaped efficiently during this period by thermal escape 

(Tian et al., 2009; Amerstorfer et al., 2017). Moreover, due to the higher EUV flux of the young 

Sun early Mars upper atmosphere expanded to larger distances so that the intrinsic magnetic 

field  may  not  have  shielded  exospheric  particles  against  escape.  A  reducing  atmosphere  (a 

smaller  CO2  mixing  ratio)  leads  to  a  higher  temperature  in  the  upper  atmosphere  due  to 

inefficient cooling and therefore allows efficient escape (Kulikov et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2009; 

Johnstone et al., 2018). Further experimental and model studies are required to test the reducing 

early Martian atmosphere scenario.  

 An additional alternative mechanism for early 13C-enrichment recorded in ALH84001 than 

atmospheric escape is isotopic fractionation by solar UV photodissociation of CO2, which may 

cause  significantly  large  carbon  isotopic  fractionation  of  about  200 ‰  based  on  theoretical 

calculation  of  absorption  spectra  of  the  CO2  isotopologues  (Schmidt  et  al.,  2013).  Such  a 

process is also relevant if Mars early atmosphere would have been lost during younger ages 

compared  to  that  of  ALH84001.  Although  the  effect  has  not  yet  been  tested  by  laboratory 

experiment,  solar  UV  could  dissociate  12CO2  preferentially,  and  thus  provide  13C-enriched 

carbonate  precipitating  from  the  remaining  CO2.  In  this  case  highly  13C-depleted  CO  is 

produced in the atmosphere. Under this reducing condition and the presence of water vapor, 

44 

 
CO could be converted mainly into formaldehyde and removed from the atmosphere (Bar-Nun 

and Hartman, 1978; Pinto et al., 1980; Bar-Nun and Chang, 1983). If this scenario is correct, 

then 12C preferentially deposited as organics into sediment, but did not escape into space.  

9 Conclusion 

We  discussed  the  relevance  of  various  loss  processes  that  led  most  likely  to  today’s 

atmospheric Ar, and Ne noble gas isotope anomalies and the depletion of moderately volatile 

rock-forming elements on the terrestrial planets. A complex interplay between the young Sun’s 

EUV flux, the accreted protoplanetary mass within the disk lifetime, a possible accumulated 

primordial H2-dominated atmosphere, the impacting bodies that were involved in the accretion 

before  and  after  disk  dispersal,  as  well  as  the  depletion  of  volatile  elements  from  planetary 

embryos and the final protoplanets led eventually to today’s measured ratios. The discovery of 

many low mass exoplanets that have captured a primordial H2-dominated atmosphere that never 

escaped to space during billions of years indicates that the accretion of smaller planets is also a 

fast  process.  One  finds  from  early  atmosphere  evolution  models  that  measured  atmospheric 

36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne and 36Ar/22Ne isotope ratios can be reproduced if proto-Venus and Earth 

were released from the solar nebula at ≈ 4 Myr with a small captured H2-dominated envelope 

and  protoplanetary  masses  of  ≈  0.85 – 1.0 MVenus  and  0.53 – 0.58 MEarth,  respectively,  and. 

From the isotopic analysis of evolution models one finds that post-H2-envelope impactors with 

an  admixture  of  ≥ 70%  carbonaceous  chondrites  and  ≤ 30%  dry  ureilite-like  material 

reproduces  Earth’s  present  atmospheric  36Ar/22Ne  isotope  ratios  at  best.  These  late  stage 

impactors, however, have to be depleted in Ar, Ne and moderately volatile elements like K. As 

long  as  the  accreting  proto-planet  were  embedded  in  the  nebula  or  surrounded  by  an  the 

escaping nebula-based H2-dominated primordial atmosphere the solar-like Ar and Ne isotope 

abundance  dominated  to  any  accreted,  or  from  the  underlying  magma  ocean  outgassed 

composition/ratios.  Because  of  this,  one  can  only  determine  from  reproduction  attempts  of 

today’s  atmospheric  Ne  and  Ar  the  accreted  material  composition  after  the  primordial 

atmosphere  was  lost.  If  EN-like  material  was  involved  in  the  accretion  of  proto-Earth  as 

suggested by Dauphas (2017), then this material should have been delivered to early Earth’s 

accretion as long as the growing proto-Earth was surrounded by nebula gas. 

Impact erosion and outgassing of volatiles from magma pools and oceans and subsequent 

escape to space should have depleted the planetary embryos that acted in the final accretion of 

the  early  terrestrial  planets.  Latest  reproduction  attempts  of  atmospheric  36Ar/38Ar  and 

20Ne/22Ne isotope ratios and bulk K/U ratios on Venus agree with the findings related to early 

45 

 
Earth’s evolution that the young Sun was less active than a moderate rotator und EUV fluxes 

corresponding to a faster rotating young Sun were very unlikely.  

Thus, new precise measurements by future Venus’ space missions of atmospheric Ar, Ne, 

Kr, and Xe noble gas isotope ratios and more data of moderately volatile elements distributed 

over a wide surface area would give a precise evolution scenario of Venus and would further 

help  to  constrain  the  Sun’s  history.  For  terrestrial  exoplanets  one  can  expect  that  different 

accretion scenarios and different radiation fields of their host stars will result in different heat 

producing elements and hence in different tectonic regimes (see also O’Neill et al., 2019; this 

issue), which can have tremendous implication for the planet’s evolution and habitability. 

From D/H analysis, one finds that Mars lost a huge fraction of its initial water inventory 

during the first 500 Myr after its origin. The low gravity and high EUV fluxes of the young Sun 

led  also  to  high  escape  rates  of  its  bulk  atmosphere.  After  the  EUV  flux  of  the  young  Sun 

decreased at ≈ 4–4.1 Ga, volcanic outgassing and impacts could have resulted in the build-up 

of a denser atmosphere of ≤ 1 bar, which is also constrained by analysis of 36Ar/38Ar and 13C/12C 

data. Analysis of the atmosphere enriched in 13C isotopes compared to Mars’ mantle may be an 

indication that early Mars was more reduced as today. CO2 could have been a minor component 

of the early Martian atmosphere as compared with CO or CH4 from a thermodynamic point of 

view. Both molecules are depleted in 13C and preferentially escaped into space, whereas  13C-

enriched CO2 is ultimately deposited as carbonate. CO2 could have been released from surface 

reservoirs during periods of climate change or impacts and may have modified the atmospheric 

surface pressure several times during the planet’s history. Since ≈ 3.5 Ga, when the young Sun’s 

EUV flux decreased to lower values, Mars’ atmospheric evolution until today was determined 

by a complex interplay of ion escape, atmospheric sputtering and suprathermal hot atom escape, 

carbonate precipitation, and serpentinization that led to today’s low surface pressure.
