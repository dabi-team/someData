We measure the liquid argon scintillation response to electronic recoils in the energy range of 2.82
to 1274.6 keV at null electric ﬁeld. The single-phase detector with a large optical coverage used in
this measurement yields 12.8 ± 0.3 (11.2 ± 0.3) photoelectron/keV for 511.0-keV γ-ray events based
on a photomultiplier tube single photoelectron response modeling with a Gaussian plus an additional
exponential term (with only a Gaussian term). It is exposed to a variety of calibration sources such
as 22Na and 241Am γ-ray emitters, and a 252Cf fast neutron emitter that induces quasimonoenergetic
γ rays through a (n, n(cid:48)γ) reaction with 19F in polytetraﬂuoroethylene. In addition, the high light
detection eﬃciency of the detector enables identiﬁcation of the 2.82-keV peak of 37Ar, a cosmogenic
isotope in atmospheric argon. The observed light yield and energy resolution of the detector are
obtained by the full-absorption peaks. We ﬁnd up to approximately 25% shift in the scintillation
yield across the energy range and 3% of the energy resolution for the 511.0-keV line. The Thomas-
Imel box model with its constant parameter ς = 0.033+0.012
−0.008 is found to explain the result. For
liquid argon, this is the ﬁrst measurement on the energy-dependent scintillation yield down to a few
keV at null ﬁeld and provides essential inputs for tuning the argon response model to be used for
physics experiments.

INTRODUCTION

tract physics quantity from observed scintillation signal
with LAr.

A liquid argon (LAr) scintillation detector has several
features that make it attractive for use in various physics
experiments to detect ionization particles: it has eﬃcient
conversion of energy deposition into a scintillation light
signal, powerful discrimination between electronic recoil
(ER) and nuclear recoil (NR) events based on its scintil-
lation pulse shape, and beneﬁts from the fact that large
quantities of argon are cheaply available. One promising
application of the detector is to search and identify the
NR signal possibly induced by a dark matter candidate,
weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [1, 2]. The
typical energy of the signal is in the range of a few keV
to several hundreds of keV. Burdensome backgrounds in
this search are ER events caused by β rays from diﬀused
isotopes (such as 39Ar and 85Kr) in LAr and γ rays from
radioimpurities in detector components. Predicting the
measured signal from these background sources is neces-
sary to estimate its contamination in the signal region of
interest. In this context, characterization of the detec-
tor response to ER events is crucial for achieving lower
energy threshold, suppressing systematic uncertainty re-
lated to background contamination, and hence enhancing
physics sensitivity of the search. Furthermore, recently
the searches for new particles, such as bosonic dark mat-
ter and axion-like particle, have been actively performed
using the ER events by xenon (e.g. [3–5]), where its scin-
tillation response is well understood [6–8], while the one
for argon is not fully established yet. Therefore this work
is essentially important for physics interpretation to ex-

In the LAr detector, a charged particle interaction ex-
cites and ionizes the detector medium, resulting in the
formation of self-trapped exciton states, Ar∗
2, through
the collision and recombination processes. The excimer is
formed in either a singlet or a triplet state, both of which
decay radiatively with vast diﬀerent lifetimes of approxi-
mately 7 ns and 1.6 µs, respectively [9]. The scintillation
light spectra from both radiative decays lie in the vacuum
ultraviolet (VUV), peaked at 128 nm [10]. As direct de-
tection of the VUV photon at LAr temperature (around
87 K) is technically challenging, it is often downshifted
to the visible region where most cryogenic photosensors
exhibit peak sensitivity using a wavelength shifter such
as 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB) [11, 12]. The
recoiled particle and its energy are inferred from the ob-
served photon signal waveform.

In this work, we measure the LAr scintillation response
to ER ranging from 2.82 to 1274.6 keV using a single-
phase detector. The measurement is performed with a
variety of calibration sources including the 2.82-keV line
of cosmic-ray induced 37Ar. Owing to a high light col-
lection eﬃciency (LCE) of the detector, the low energy
37Ar line in the scintillation signal is identiﬁed. Although
these kinds of measurement under ﬁnite electric ﬁeld is
important as well, we herein focus on the scintillation
response at null electric ﬁeld. We present the energy
dependence of the scintillation yield, as well as the ba-
sic properties of this detector such as the observed light
yield and energy resolutions of the full-absorption peaks.
The energy dependence of the scintillation yield down to
a few keV is discussed by comparing a model prediction,
which is allowed by the use of the 37Ar source.

FIG. 1. LAr handling system consisting of the ﬁlling line
(left part of the schematic), the vacuum line (top center), the
recirculation line (right), and the main cryostat (center). In
the recirculation line, gaseous argon (GAr) extracted from
the cryostat is pumped into the getters after passing through
a heat exchanger. It then returns to the heat exchanger to
be cooled and is condensed in the liqueﬁer. The cryostat
containing the detector maintains GAr and LAr over the data
collection period in stable cryogenic conditions.

II. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

The measurement presented here is performed at the
surface laboratory at Waseda University. Figure 1 shows
the argon handling system used in this work. It mainly
consists of a stainless-steel cryostat of diameter 50 cm
and height 100 cm, in which a scintillation detector sits.
The argon ﬁlled in the cryostat is cooled by the recircu-
lation system, which extracts hot gas from the cryostat
and passes it through the liqueﬁer with a 200-W GM cry-
ocooler (Sumitomo CH-110). The argon is maintained at
a typical pressure of 1.4 atm and at a liquid level that
varies by no more than 1 mm throughout the data col-
lection period.

Impurities in the argon (such as water, oxygen, and
nitrogen) aﬀect the scintillation properties, resulting in a
reduced signal yield [13–15]. In order to remove adsorbed
impurities and outgassing from the detector components,
the whole system is pumped to vacuum over about ten
days before the measurement. The pressure of the cryo-
stat reaches below 1.0 × 10−3 Pa. Then, commercial LAr
ﬁlls the system via a single path through a liquid ﬁlter
consisting of a molecular sieve and reduced copper which
removes electronegative impurities. Additional puriﬁca-
tion is continuously performed by the getters (SAES Mi-
croTorr MC1500-902 and PURERON GP-5) in the recir-
culation system. Several measurements performed in this
system conﬁrm the concentrations of these impurities are
negligible in this measurement: water and oxygen con-
taminations of sub-ppb level and nitrogen contamination

scaled). The detector including the PMTs is immersed in
LAr. Oxygen-free copper (OFC) of roughly 2 cm thick and
lead of 10 cm thick surround the cryostat and act as a passive
shield against ambient γ rays. An 241Am source is installed
at the outer surface of the PTFE bulk, and the other sources
(137Cs, 22Na, 133Ba, and 252Cf) are placed on the outside
surface of the cryostat wall.

of sub-ppm level.

The scintillation detector shown in Fig. 2 is designed
to minimize the loss of scintillation photons in their path
and maximize LCE. The cylindrical ﬁducial volume of the
detector has a diameter 6.4 cm and a length 5 cm, con-
tained within an approximately 3-cm-thick polytetraﬂu-
oroethylene (PTFE) sleeve. The PTFE sleeve serves
not only as the main detector structure but also as a
γ-ray emitter, as will be described in Sec. IV B. A mul-
tilayer plastic-foil reﬂector (3M ESR) coated with the
TPB wavelength shifter lines the inner surface of the
PTFE sleeve. Each end of the cylindrical volume is
capped by a 3-in. Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier
tubes (PMTs), with around 30% quantum eﬃciency for
blue light after wavelength conversion by the TPB. The
PMT windows are also coated with the TPB. Both the
TPB layer on the reﬂector and that on the PMT windows
are deposited using a vacuum-evaporation technique, and
their amounts are approximately 40 and 30 µg/cm2, re-
spectively, corresponding to the deposited-layer thick-
nesses of O(1 µm). These are conﬁrmed by a quartz
crystal microbalance sensor and a stylus proﬁler, as with
a procedure similar to that reported in Ref. [16]. The
3-in. PMTs are operated with a negative bias voltage of
−1570 V. Field-shaping rings with the same bias voltage
are embed in the PTFE bulk and ensure electric ﬁeld in-
side the ﬁducial volume less than 1 V/cm to establish the
measurement under null electric ﬁeld. The whole sleeve
is immersed in a LAr bath contained in the cryostat.

Four 2-in. PMTs (Hamamatsu R6041-506) are imple-
mented to view the LAr bath surrounding the ﬁducial
volume, as shown in Fig. 2. These PMTs are located
20 cm above the ﬁducial volume and just below the liquid
surface so that additional energy deposition in the outer
region is tagged by a coincident scintillation signal. The
windows of the PMTs are also coated with TPB. A pas-
sive shield against ambient γ rays surrounds the cryostat,

injected into the ﬁducial volume through optical ﬁber,
while the generator simultaneously triggers the DAQ sys-
tem, and the corresponding waveforms from each PMT
are recorded over a window of ±1 µs. A baseline ADC
count is determined by the ﬁrst 0.6 µs of the window, and
its subtraction is applied waveform by waveform. The
charge response of the PMT is measured by integrating
the waveforms within a 48-ns window starting 20 ns prior
to the photoelectron pulse arrival time. The gain value
is determined by ﬁtting the charge distribution to model
functions. In this analysis, two models are considered to
describe the PMT response. One expression of the mod-
els (gain-model A) as a function of the integrated charge
q is followed to that used in Ref. [17]:

(cid:88)

f (q) =

P (n; λ) × fn(q),

n
fn(q) = ρ(q) ∗ ψn∗
1 (q),
ρ(q) = G(q; x0, σped),

(1)

ψ1(q) =

pE
τ

exp(−q/τ ) + (1 − pE)G(q; xm, σm)

where P (n; λ) is a Poisson distribution with mean λ,
G(q; x, σ) is a Gaussian distribution with mean x and
standard division σ, ∗ denotes a convolution, ψ1(q) is
the PMT single photoelectron response, and ψn∗
1 (q) is the
n-fold convolution of ψ1(q) with itself. This model con-
sists of two components comprising the PMT response:
a simple Gaussian term, which accounts for a photoelec-
tron signal fully ampliﬁed by the dynode chain, and an
exponential term characterized by a parameter τ , which
accounts for underampliﬁed photoelectrons and/or feed-
back from the dynode photoemission signal. The frac-
tion of the single photoelectron response found to be the
underampliﬁed terms is pE. Another expression (gain-
model B) is simpler, consisting of only the Gaussian term;
i.e., the fraction pE in Eq. (1) is ﬁxed to 0. This assumes
that there is no underampliﬁed or dynode-feedback re-
sponse in a PMT and that the photoelectron response is
perfectly described by Gaussians.

Figure 3 shows the charge distribution and ﬁt for a
LED calibration run with the gain-model A (which has a
nonzero fraction pE), where 1 count · sample corresponds
to an output charge of 9.8 × 10−15 C. The mean charge
for a single photoelectron g deﬁned as

g = pEτ + (1 − pE)xm

(2)

is approximately 2.0 × 106 e−/p.e. with a bias voltage
of −1570 V. The ﬁt with the gain-model B (i.e., simple
convolution of Gaussian functions) returns a 12% higher
gain value than gain-model A. This diﬀerence is nearly
consistent with the result reported in Ref. [17]. While
we do not have enough data to determine which model
is more appropriate to describe the PMT response, the
gain-model A is adopted as the baseline, and the result
from the model is used in the later analysis. This calibra-
tion is performed every 12 hours during a data collection
period lasting seven days. The overall stabilities of the

which consists of roughly 2-cm-thick oxygen-free copper
and 10-cm-thick lead.

The data acquisition (DAQ) system used in this exper-
iment consists of a 14-bit, 250-MS/s ﬂash analog-digital-
converter (ADC) (Struck SIS3316). The signals from
two ﬁducial-viewing PMTs and four outer-bath PMTs
are digitized and recorded. The length of the digitizer
records is set to 25 µs (5 µs before a trigger point and
20 µs after), longer than the lifetime of the slow compo-
nent of LAr scintillation light. The trigger is given by
the coincidence, within 1 µs, of the two ﬁducial PMTs
with pulses above a threshold, which is set just above
the baseline noise and below a typical single photoelec-
tron (p.e.) pulse. The coincidence decision is internally
made by the ﬂash ADC board itself. An inhibition time
of 100 µs is introduced after each trigger to prevent re-
triggering of the afterpulse of the PMTs, which mainly
occurs after events with far greater energies than the re-
gion of interest (e.g., cosmic-ray events). A Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation of the LAr data sample is generated to
evaluate the trigger eﬃciency. By emulating the internal
trigger logic of the ﬂash ADC board on these MC events,
the eﬃciency is found to be consistent with unity for ER
signals larger than 25 p.e., as shown in Fig. 10.

ing a blue light-emitting diode (LED) powered by a pulse

a width of approximately 20 ns at tenth maximum are

gain and observed light yield during the period are within
less than 0.5% from both the LED measurement and an
energy calibration mentioned below.

The nonlinearity of the PMT is studied by a pulsed
laser source, and we found that the eﬀect is less than 1%
(0.1%) at 1 MeV (below 200 keV) at the operation volt-
age. The observed light yields are corrected accordingly,
and its correction factors are considered as a systematic
uncertainty.

B. Signal analysis and selection criteria

The analysis of the LAr scintillation signal
formed following a photon-counting algorithm.
For
each waveform, this algorithm ﬁrst calculates the base-
line from the pretrigger window; once that baseline is
subtracted, all samples above a software threshold are
grouped with three neighboring samples (one bin before
and two bins after). The software threshold is set based
on the baseline noise and is below a typical single photo-
electron PMT pulse. The signal detection time is identi-
ﬁed as the ﬁrst sampling time above a threshold of 50%
peak amplitude. Detected scintillation light is deﬁned as
the integrated charge in the time interval between −0.04
and 7.0 µs. A pulse shape discrimination (PSD) param-
eter is also deﬁned as the fraction of light detected after
0.1 µs of the scintillation signal (termed “slow/total”).

A set of data quality cuts is applied to remove instru-
mental eﬀects and event pileups. The selection criteria
are as follows: (1) Software imposes a 10-ms veto af-
ter events that contain signals greater than ≈2.0 × 104
(≈5.0 × 103 p.e.) for datasets taken with a γ-ray source
with >100 keV (<100 keV) its energy. This aims to re-
move the unstable period of the PMT after outputting a
large charge signal. (2) The event has a stable baseline
noise and no more than 0.7 p.e. pulses in the pretrigger
(3) The event does not occur near the PMT
window.

event is consistent with that of the ER. This requirement
is particularly important for the 252Cf data because it
enhances the γ-ray full-absorption peaks over continuous
nuclear recoil spectrum. The band of the parameter used
in this cut is determined by 22Na data requiring the co-
incidence detection of the backward-traveling 511-keV γ
ray whose details are described in the following section.
The selection band contains 95% of ER events, as shown
in Fig. 4.

C. Determination of photoelectron per keV with
sodium-22 and cesium-137 sources

Determination of the observed light yield, photoelec-
tron per keV of the detector is performed by 511.0-,
661.7-, and 1274.6-keV γ rays. The γ-ray sources, 137Cs
and 22Na, with approximately 1 MBq, respectively, are
placed on the outside surface of the cryostat wall to ex-
pose the γ ray to the detector.

with the 137Cs source. The full-absorption peak of the
661.7-keV line of the 137Cs source is ﬁt with a Gaussian
with mean µ and width σ. The continuous background
components around the peak, mainly coming from the
Compton edge and degraded tails, are modeled with error
and linear functions and added to the ﬁt function. The
ﬁt shown in Fig. 5 returns χ2/ndf = 62.5/56.

The observed light spectra obtained with the 22Na
source are shown in Fig. 6. In this measurement, an addi-
tional NaI(Tl) scintillator (2 × 2 in.2 cylinder) is set with
the source at opposite sites of the cryostat to tag the
backward-traveling 511.0-keV γ ray (back-to-back tag-
ging). The distance between the cryostat wall and the
source is set to 15 cm, and that between the source and
the scintillator to 25 cm. The black and blue spectra
in Fig. 6 are the observed scintillation spectra before and
after requiring the coincidence detection of the 511.0-keV
γ-ray signal in the NaI(Tl) scintillator. Since the 1274.6-
keV γ ray is considered to have no angular correlation
with back-to-back γ rays, the corresponding peak ap-
pears only in the former spectrum. Each peak is ﬁt with
a Gaussian plus background model function consisting of
error and linear functions. Values of χ2/ndf = 72.6/72
and χ2/ndf = 96.5/48 are returned from the ﬁts for
1274.6- and 511.0-keV peaks, respectively.

These observed photoelectron signals contain extra
charge from PMT afterpulses and systematic eﬀect from
the photon-counting algorithm. A correction for these
eﬀects is thus applied to reconstruct the observed light
signal per ER energy. This correction is based on an in-
dependent study of the PMT response as well as a MC
simulation of the LAr signal. It is relatively small, ap-
proximately 1% for the 137Cs line and less than 3% for the
whole energy region of interest of this analysis, where the
amount of afterpulse is estimated as 2%–4% of the pho-
toelectron signal, and the algorithm can systematically
slightly underestimate the charge signal. The observed

ble I with uncertainties. The uncertainty includes the
estimation of PMT afterpulses, systematic error in the
corrections, and stability of the detector.

IV. MEASUREMENT OF SCINTILLATION
RESPONSE WITH CALIBRATION SOURCES

A. Barium-133 source

The detector is exposed to a 356.0-keV γ ray using a
133Ba radioactive source with approximately 1 MBq. The
spectrum obtained with a 133Ba source is shown in Fig. 7.
The peak around 4700 p.e. corresponds to the γ-ray line
and ﬁtted with a Gaussian. An exponential function is
added to the ﬁt function to model the overall background
components; the main background sources are due to the
degraded γ-ray tail and the γ-ray spectra of the other
two lines of the 133Ba source around the peak energy
(those at 383.9 and 302.9 keV) that have relatively high
intensity. The resulting ﬁt function is overlaid in Fig. 7.

B. Californium-252 source exploiting γ rays
through the (n, n(cid:48)γ) reaction with ﬂuorine-19

Measurements for the 109.8- and 197.1-keV quasimo-
noenergetic lines are performed using γ rays emitted from
the (n, n(cid:48)γ) reaction with 19F [18]. As an external fast
neutron source, a 252Cf source with a spontaneous ﬁssion
rate of approximately 1 × 105 ﬁssion/s is used. The dis-
tance between the center of the ﬁducial volume and the
source is set to 90 cm. The NaI(Tl) scintillator is placed
beside the source to detect associated γ rays from the
spontaneous ﬁssion and to provide timing information.
Fast neutrons from 252Cf generate (n, n(cid:48)γ) reaction with
19F in the PTFE bulk, producing quasimonoenergetic
γ rays. Although the intensities of each quasimonoen-
ergetic line depend upon their incident neutron energy,

from the α ray from the primary disintegration is de-
tected by the outer-bath PMTs, allowing the γ-ray in-
teraction to be proved in the ﬁducial volume. Figure 9
shows the observed light spectrum after requiring the de-
tection of the α-ray signals in the outer region. Because
of the relatively low energy of the γ ray from 241Am and
the passive components between the source and the ﬁdu-
cial volume, the spectrum does not exhibit a clear full-
absorption peak. The tail of the peak comes from γ rays
that reach the ﬁducial volume via single or multiple scat-
tering from any materials in their path.

The detector response to a 59.5-keV γ ray is evaluated
via MC simulation of the experimental setup based on
the Geant4 toolkit [19, 20]. The MC simulation takes
into account the detector geometry and composition in-
side the LAr bath, as well as the radioisotope mounting
structure. It proceeds by generating γ rays from 241Am
with a random momentum direction and calculating the
energy deposition in the ﬁducial volume. The observed
spectrum is ﬁtted by converting the energy deposition
to the observed light yield with a constant scintillation
yield, constant LCE, and Gaussian resolution. The best
ﬁt spectrum is also shown in Fig. 9; although the ﬁt is
performed only around the 59.5-keV peak (700–900 p.e.),
reasonable agreement between the data and MC is found
down to around 400 p.e.

Measurement for ERs of a few keV is performed using
37Ar, which is the second most abundant radioactive iso-
tope in atmospheric argon, comprising an abundance of
≈1.3 × 10−20 [21]. It decays via electron capture to the
ground state of 37Cl with a half-life of 35 days, producing
x rays and Auger electrons with a total energy release of
2.82 keV (for K-shell capture), 0.27 keV (for L-shell cap-
ture), or 0.02 keV (for M-shell capture) [22, 23]. Since

dioactive sources described in the previous section. Non-
linear response on the scintillation yield is seen, which
peaks around 200 keV. This trend can be attributed to
the energy dependence of the ionization electron-ion re-
combination probability. The Thomas-Imel box (TIB)
model [26] and Doke-Birks’s law [27] can presumably ex-
plain the data, as is the case for the liquid xenon (LXe)
scintillation detector [6]. For the higher energy range,
the Doke-Birks’s law is generally applied to deal with
relativistic and longer-range tracks and to predict the
decrease of the probability as the track energy increases
(or dE/dx decreases). On the other hand, for the lower
energy range, typically less than O(10 keV), it is known
that the TIB model is suitable for modeling the data be-
cause it is based on the low energy recoiled track whose
range is comparable to or shorter than the mean ion-
ization electron-ion thermalization distance. The TIB
model predicts the increase of the probability as the track
energy increase (or number of ionization electron-ion pair
increase). Further study for quantitative evaluation and
modeling of the LAr response will be discussed in Sec. VI.
The energy resolution of the detector is also character-
ized based on the full-absorption peaks and is shown in
the lower panel of Fig. 11. The set of points is ﬁt to the

where σs accounts for stochastic ﬂuctuation, and σc ac-
counts for the variance of the mean value of monoenergy
deposition. The values are found to be σs = 0.37 ± 0.03
and σc = 0.021 ± 0.002, respectively.

Several sources are expected to degrade the energy res-
olution. The contribution of each source is examined
and listed in Table II. Convoluting the stochastic terms
(σs/(cid:112)Eγ) listed in Table II explains approximately 90%
of the stochastic term observed in the data. The rest
of the term possibly comes from ﬂuctuations in the ion-
ization electron-ion recombination process; detecting the
charge yield would be necessary to fully address it. The

the production of 37Ar is mainly due to cosmogenic acti-
vation of atmospheric argon [21], it is expected to reach
equilibrium and the decay rate of 37Ar in the detector
is expected to be constant from the argon ﬁlling time to
the end of measurement.

The data used in this measurement come from approx-
imately 27 hours of detector operation without any exter-
nal sources. Figure 10 shows the observed light spectrum
for this measurement. The spectrum consists of events
that do not have associated scintillation signals in any of
the four outer-bath PMTs. The peak around 25 p.e. is
attributed to the energy release of 2.82 keV from 37Ar.
No structures corresponding to the L- or M-shell cap-
ture could be seen, probably due to the large amount of
random coincidence background and the lack of photo-
statistics. The spectrum with 37Ar is ﬁtted with the sum
of the Gaussian, exponential, and constant terms that
describe the signal and low energy background model.
The rate of 37Ar decays returned by the ﬁt is approxi-
mately 25 mBq/kg, which is compatible with literature
values [21, 24, 25]. The goodness of ﬁt for the peak is
χ2/ndf = 82.21/84.

constant term (σc) is believed to mainly consist of the
geometrical eﬀect.

The result is subjected to several systematic uncer-
tainty sources which stem from both the detector re-
sponse and the analysis procedure, as listed in Table III.
The former is the linearity of the PMT gain and its af-
terpulse explored by the PMT response study using both
LAr data and a property measurement of the PMT af-
ter the LAr detector operation and the time stability of
the detector complex monitored by the regular calibra-
tions throughout the data collection period. The latter
mainly comes from the photon-counting algorithm part
and the related correction of the analysis. We assign the
size of the correction as the uncertainty. Relatively small
uncertainty is attributed to the ﬁt of the full-absorption
peak, which is estimated by reﬁtting the peak with a
simple Gaussian function. The trigger eﬃciency is an
additional uncertainty source for the 37Ar line analysis.
We reﬁt the peak without the correction, and assign the
corresponding uncertainty as the variation between these
results.

The uncertainty of the energy resolution is considered
as typically 10% in total, mainly from the ﬁtting model-
ing.

VI. TIB MODEL INTERPRETATION ON
SCINTILLATION RESPONSE

The absolute scintillation yield, the number of photons
generated by an incident particle nph per unit energy de-
position photon/keV is a more essential quantity for the
LAr scintillation detector than the observed light signal
per incident energy p.e./keV. The yield for a recoiled
electron is measured by Doke et al. as 41±2 photon/keV
using a 1-MeV β-ray source [29].

On the other hand, the 511-keV full-absorption point
is the most suitable energy for the comparison between
the previous measurements since several works [17, 30–
32] have commonly presented the observed light yield
at this point. As the scintillation yield of a γ-ray full-
absorption event is aﬀected by the energy dependence
of that for recoiled electrons because of multiple scatter-
ing, we perform a Geant4 MC simulation to evaluate it.

FIG. 12. Top: the γ-ray cross sections for argon provided by
XCOM [28]. Bottom: average number of interaction points
for the full-absorption peaks calculated by the Geant4 MC
simulation.

Figure 12 shows the average number of the interaction
points. It indicates that 511-keV full-absorption events
contain about three interaction points on average; how-
ever, a discrepancy between the yield for the 511-keV γ
ray and that for the β ray is found to be less than 2%
when assuming Doke-Birks’s law (gray line in Fig. 13)
[29]. Therefore, we determine the absolute scintillation
yield by using the 511-keV point and referring the Doke’s
measurement.

Figure 13 shows the scintillation yield obtained in this
analysis. As mentioned in the previous section, the en-
ergy dependence of the yield is attributed to the ioniza-
tion electron-ion recombination probability. For a lower
energy event, the TIB model presumably predicts the re-

lation detector with the TPB wavelength shifter is im-
mersed in puriﬁed LAr and yields 12.8 ± 0.3 p.e./keV
(11.2±0.3 p.e./keV) for a 511.0-keV γ-ray full-absorption
event based on the PMT calibration assuming a PMT
single photoelectron response model with an additional
exponential term (with only a Gaussian term), and its
energy resolution is 3% for the γ-ray line. The scin-
tillation response is investigated by the full-absorption
peaks of external γ-ray sources, as well as an 37Ar source
with a 2.82-keV line. These measurements demonstrate
that the scintillation yield decreases in the low energy
region. We interpret it by analogy with the LXe scintil-
lation detector response, where the ionization electron-
ion recombination probability is attributed to the energy
dependence of the yield. By referring the previous mea-
surement of the scintillation yield at 1 MeV, the TIB
model parameter ς is calculated by the 2.82-keV point as
ς = 0.033+0.012
−0.008.

FIG. 13. Measured scintillation yield as a function of the inci-
dent energy Eγ (black solid circle). The absolute yield is de-
termined by referring the measurement by Doke et al. (black
open circle) [29]. The TIB model function with a parameter
found by the 2.82-keV point is shown with its uncertainty (red
band). The results from other experiments, CLEAN (violet
star point) [30], DarkSide-10 (green ﬁlled square) [17], ARIS
(blue open square and blue ﬁlled rhombus) [31], and Xiong
et al. (green open rhombus) [32] are also shown where each
yield is normalized at 511 keV referring the Doke-Birks’s law
(gray solid line) [29].

where Eer is the recoiled electron energy, W = 19.5 eV is
the eﬀective work function [27], Nex and Ni are the num-
bers of produced excitons or electron-ion pairs, respec-
tively, α = 0.21 is the initial ratio of the average of Nex to
Ni [33], and ς is a constant parameter of the model. Con-
sidering the facts that the number of the interaction point
of the 37Ar events can be approximated to be one due to
its low energy deposition and decay mode mainly con-
sisting of Auger electrons [22], and that the TIB model
is fully applied for liquid xenon at corresponding energy
where the electron track length is smaller than the ther-
malization distance of the ionization electron [6, 34], we
determine the parameter ς from the 37Ar data. It is cal-
culated as ς = 0.033+0.012
−0.008 and represented with the red
band in Fig. 13. Further studies, such as additional mea-
surements around 10 keV and discussion on the stitching
between the TIB model and Doke-Birks’s law, should
be performed in future work. This result also would be
practically essential input for tuning the response model
implemented, for instance, in the NEST package [35].

electronic recoils ranging from 2.82 to 1274.6 keV is mea-
sured using a single-phase detector with high LCE ex-
posed to a variety of calibration sources. The scintil-
