Abstract In the current article, we study anisotropic
spherically symmetric strange star under the background
of f (R, T ) gravity using the metric potentials of Tolman-
Kuchowicz type [1,2] as λ(r) = ln(1 + ar2 + br4) and
ν(r) = Br2 + 2 ln C which are free from singularity, sat-
isfy stability criteria and also well behaved. We calcu-
late the value of constants a, b, B and C using matching
conditions and the observed values of the masses and
radii of known samples. To describe the strange quark
matter (SQM) distribution, here we have used the phe-
nomenological MIT bag model equation of state (EOS)
where the density proﬁle (ρ) is related to the radial
pressure (pr) as pr(r) = 1
4Bg). Here quark pres-
3 (ρ
sure is responsible for generation of bag constant Bg.
Motivation behind this study lies in ﬁnding out a non-
singular physically acceptable solution having various
properties of strange stars. The model shows consis-
tency with various energy conditions, TOV equation,
Herrera’s cracking condition and also with Harrison-
Zel′dovich-Novikov’s static stability criteria. Numerical
values of EOS parameter and the adiabatic index also
enhance the acceptability of our model.

1 Introduction

Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) consists of concep-
tual ingenuity and mathematical elegance in its ev-
ery steps. To describe a gravitating system and non-
inertial frames from a classical view point at large scale
regimes, GR is a highly useful tool [3]. But inspite of its
beauty, singularity makes it stagnant [4] in few cases.

Also the theory is unable to behave rationally for the
description of observational accelerating phase of the
Universe. It cannot describe properly the cosmic dy-
namics of the Universe without considering the exotic
form of matter-energy which is supposed to be known
as dark matter and dark energy [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,
13,14]. Einstein’s GR does not consider the quantum
nature of matter and cannot be quantized in a conven-
tional way of renormalization. In this line of thinking it
was shown [15] that inclusion of higher order curvature
terms in Einstein-Hilbert action will make the system
renormalizable in one loop. On the other hand, to in-
clude quantum corrections one has to consider higher
order curvature invariants in the eﬀective gravitational
action at low energy regime [16,17,18].

To overcome the above mentioned problems of GR,
several modiﬁed or alternative theories of gravitation
have been proposed from time to time by researchers.
The modiﬁcation has been done by changing the ge-
ometrical part of the Einstein ﬁeld equations (EFE),
i.e., the action is modiﬁed by considering a general-
ized functional form of gravitational Lagrangian den-
sity. Some of the well known relevant alternative the-
ories of gravitation are f (R) gravity [19,20,21,22,23],
f (T) gravity [24,25], f (R, T ) gravity [26,27,28,29,30,
31,32,33,34], f (T, T ) gravity [35,36,37,38,39,40], f (G)
gravity [41,42,43] and f (R, G) gravity [44] where R, T,
T and G are scalar curvature, torsion scalar, trace of
the energy momentum tensor and Gauss-Bonnet scalar
respectively.

In the present work we are interested in f (R, T )
theory. This theory is developed by considering non-
minimal coupling between the Ricci Scalar R and trace
of the energy momentum tensor T . Harko et al. [45] in-
troduced it ﬁrst to tackle the problems in an eﬃcient
way. In this theory matter is considered on an equal

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

footing with geometry. As a result one can explore many
interesting and novel features of the Universe, such as
the role of dark matter [46]. One can note that depen-
dency of T may come from the consideration of quan-
tum eﬀects or from the presence of an imperfect ﬂuid.
Neutron stars have been the subject of immense
study for the last few decades due to its small size (ra-
dius
⊙
1017 kg/m3), which distort
a tremendous density (ρ
the space-time geometry [47]. They take birth from the
gravitationally collapsing massive star (M > 8M
), af-
ter type II supernovae explosion [48]. Neutron stars en-
riched with neutrons, spin rapidly and often making
several hundred rotations per second. Sometimes neu-
tron stars form radio pulsars, emitting radio waves.

The tremendous pressure and density is probably
responsible for phase transition of neutrons inside the
neutron stars to hyperon (Λ, Σ, Ξ, ∆, Ω) and quark mat-
ter (u, d, s). Cameron [49] predicted that conversion of
nucleon into hyperon is energetically more favourable.
Interior (specially core) of the neutron star contains
quark matter since they become free of interaction due
to high energy density and extreme asymptotic momen-
tum transfer. The idea that quark matter may exist in
the core of the neutron star, has been suggested by sev-
eral scientists [50,51,52,53,54,55,56].

The energy level of the hyperon at the Fermi-surface
becomes higher than its rest mass, due to the tremen-
dous density and as a result these particles could be de-
conﬁned into strange quarks. Though quark stars may
contain up (u), down (d) and strange (s) quarks but
mostly they contain strange (s) quarks [51,57,58,59,
60] since strange quarks are the most stable ones. Un-
der some conditions, up (u) and down (d) quarks can
also be transformed into strange (s) quarks. So once
up (u) and down (d) quarks of the quark star convert
into strange matter, the entire quark matter get con-
verted into strange matter. In this way neutron stars
may be totally converted into strange quark star [61].
The neutron stars may very well contain quark matter
in their cores, which ought to be in a color supercon-
ducting state [62,63,64,65]. But still now, no one has
been able to predict (theoretically or experimentally)
the exact density at which expected phase transition to
quark matter occurs.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) deals with the
quark conﬁnement mechanism. At asymptotic density,
the ground state of QCD with a vanishing strange quark
mass is the color-ﬂavor-locked (CFL) phase. According
to Chodos et al. [66], a strongly interacting particle can
be deﬁned as a ﬁnite region of space, conﬁned with
ﬁelds and bag constant is such a candidate. As a result,
bag constant aﬀects the energy momentum tensor of

the star and even the spacetime geometry. According to
the MIT bag model, the universal pressure Bg known
as bag constant, is responsible for quark conﬁnement
and it is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between energy den-
sity of the perturbative and non-perturbative quantum
chromodynamics vacuum. According to Farhi [67] and
Alcock [60], for a stable strange quark matter (SQM),
the bag constant should be within the following range
(55-75) MeV/fm3 under GR. However CERN-SPS and
RHIC [68] provided a wide range of this constant.

Abbas et al. [69] using MIT bag model, investigated
anisotropic charged strange stars in f (T ) gravity em-
ploying the diagonal tetrad ﬁeld of static space-time.
Biswas et al. [70], have established a new model for
highly compact anisotropic strange star using the met-
ric potentials, given by Krori-Barua [71] under f (R, T )
gravity. Besides these, several studies are available in
literature survey [72,73,74,75,76,77,78] based on strange
star.

Inhomogeneous matter distribution and its evolu-
tion changes the fabric of the spacetime of compact ob-
jects and leads to the anisotropic features. Anisotropy
plays an important role to study the stellar properties.
Anisotropic pressure measures the diﬀerence between
radial component of pressure and tangential compo-
nent of pressure. Ruderman [79] ﬁrst argued that at
very high density (> 1015 gm/cc) anisotropy in pres-
sure arises and we have to treat nuclear interactions
relativistically. Diﬀerent physical properties of a stel-
lar object like energy density, total mass, gravitational
redshift and frequency of oscillation of the fundamen-
tal mode are aﬀected by the anisotropy. The reasons
behind the anisotropy are provided by diﬀerent scien-
tists in their research work from time to time. Usov [80]
suggested that strong electric ﬁeld is the producer of
anisotropy. According to Weber [81] the anisotropy in
pressure inside a strange star is due to immense mag-
netic ﬁeld of the neutron star. Sokolov [82] argued that
diﬀerent types of phase transitions can be taken as re-
sponsible for this anisotropy. Also pion condensation
can be taken as one of the reason behind the anisotropy,
predicted by Sawyer [83]. According to Kippenhahn and
Weigert [84], the anisotropy may arise due to presence
of a type 3A superﬂuid or existence of solid stellar core.
The literature survey regarding anisotropic ﬂuid sphere
are provided in the following references [85,86,87,88,
89,90,91,92,93,94,159,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103].

In this background, we shall summarize our research
work as follows. Basic mathematics behind f (R, T ) grav-
ity has been discussed in Sect. 2. Solutions to EFEs for
strange star and the proper choice of EOS for SQM dis-
tribution have been explained in Sect. 3. Sect. 4 con-
tains the boundary conditions from whics we have cal-

culated all the model parameters. In Sect. 5, diﬀerent
physical features like density and pressure (5.1), energy
conditions (5.2), have studied along with diﬀerent sta-
bility criteria like Herrera’s cracking conditions (5.3.1),
TOV equation (5.3.2), adiabatic index (5.3.3), equa-
tions of state parameter (5.3.4) and Harrison-Zel′dovich-
Novikov static stability criteria (5.3.5) etc. The eﬀec-
tive mass, compactness, i.e., the mass-radius ratio from
which one can calculate the gravitational as well as the
surface redshift, has been discussed in Sect. 5.4. Finally,
in Sect. 6, we have provided an overall conclusion of
our detailed study from diﬀerent aspect of strange star
model.

3 Solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations

To study a strange star, we consider the static, spheri-
cally symmetric stellar conﬁguration, for which the line
element of the interior space-time, can be described as
the following metric:

ds2 = eν(r)dt2

Here the metric potentials λ(r) and ν(r) are chosen
as λ(r) = ln(1 + ar2 + br4) and ν(r) = Br2 + 2 ln C,
known as Tolman-Kuchowicz metric potentials [1,2].
The constants a, b, B and C can be determined us-
ing matching conditions. The non-zero components of

The strange quark matter distribution inside the
strange star has been generated by the simplest phe-
nomenological MIT bag model EOS [66,67,60]. The

4

quark pressure of SQM, considering the quarks are non-
interacting, massless and including all the corrections
of energy and pressure, can be deﬁned as

where pf is the individual pressure of all three ﬂavors
of quarks and Bg is the bag Constant.

The relation between the individual quark pressure
pf and energy density of individual quark ﬂavor is given
by pf = 1
3 ρf . Therefore deconﬁned quarks inside the
bag have the total energy ρ as follows

ρ =

ρf + Bg.

Xf =u,d,s

(13)

Using Eqs. (15) and (16) we have the MIT bag EOS

as

pr(r) = α [ρ(r)

(14)

where α is a constant having numerical value 0.28 for
the massive strange quarks with mass 250 MeV and 1

are the necessary conditions for the solution to be free

star and achieve maximum value at the surface of the
star. Variation of Bg with the coupling constant χ has
also shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). From the display, one
can note that χ eﬀectively reduces the Bg value. Here,
for simpliﬁcation, we have assumed χ = 1 for which

Eqs. (16)-(18) provide us the eﬀective density, eﬀective
radial pressure and eﬀective tangential pressure. Since,
as an example for strange star candidate, we have con-
2230, it will be most eﬀective if we
sidered P SRJ 1614
look at the numerical values of those eﬀective quantities
for this star. From Table 2 it is noticeable that eﬀec-

Though the decreasing nature of the eﬀective density is
very prominent but very high matter density through-
out the stellar system make it as a possible candidate of
ultra dense strange quark star [105,106]. The graphical
variation of ρef f (Fig 3, left panel) demonstrates that
it is maximum at the center and decreases gradually
with the radius of the star.

The variation of the eﬀective radial pressure pef f
as well as the transverse pressure pef f
(Fig 3, middle
panel) also maintain the same pattern, i.e., they are
maximum at the center and decreases nonlinearly with
the radius of the star. Their ﬁnite value at the center
of the star makes it a singularity free model of strange
star. The graphical variation of the pressures clearly
indicate that at the surface, eﬀective radial pressure
vanishes prominently whereas eﬀective tangential pres-
sure retain a ﬁnite value which make the shape of the
star spheroidal in nature [107,108,103]. The origin of
this spheroidicity makes it a topic of future research.

The anisotropic stress is represented in Eq. (19).
The beauty of this expression is that the anisotropy
will be directed inward when ∆ < 0, i.e. pef f
t < pef f
whereas ∆ > 0, i.e. pef f
implies that direc-
tion of the anisotropy will be outward [109]. From the
graphical variation of the anisotropic stress (Fig 3, right
panel), it is clear that at the origin anisotropy van-
ishes, i.e. at the center the eﬀective perpendicular pres-
sures are equal. Also we can observe that anisotropy
increases nonlinearly with the increase of the radius of
the star. The positive value of the anisotropic stress
helps to construct more compact object as described
by Gokhroo and Mehra [110]. The graphical represen-
tation of anisotropic stress shows that it achieves max-
imum value at the surface of the star, which according
to the Deb et al. [161] is an inherent property of any
ultra dense compact object.

5.1 Density and pressure

We know that the density and pressure are the most im-
portant physical quantity in the study of a stellar sys-
tem. Since we consider anisotropic ﬂuid distribution in
the modiﬁed gravity in the speciﬁc form f (R, T ), so we
have to consider the eﬀective value of those quantities.

The distribution of matter in the space-time, as mea-
sured by an observer, is termed as energy conditions.
The positivity of these conditions implies the ﬂow of
matter should be along null or time-like world line.
Our proposed anisotropic ﬂuid distribution will be con-
sistent with the energy conditions, i.e., the null en-

But several matter conﬁgurations violate the strong
energy condition, e.g. for a scalar ﬁeld with a posi-
tive potential and any cosmological inﬂationary pro-
cess [112] can violate this condition. In such a situation
we have to use an alternative theory of gravity since vi-
olation of SEC will violate the classical regime of GTR.
From the graphical variation (Fig. 4) it is clear that
our model satisﬁes all the energy conditions for coupling
constant χ = 1 which will represent a stable anisotropic
strange star conﬁguration of our consideration.

5.3 Stability Criteria

5.3.1 Herrera’s concept for stability analysis

rs < 1 and 0 < v2

The stability of our model can be checked by the help of
causality condition of Herrera. According to this condi-
tion, square of the radial and tangential speed of sound
for anisotropic ﬂuid distribution should follow the re-
sults 0 < v2
ts < 1. Another concept
for checking the stability of a stellar system is known
as cracking concept. It appears when the equilibrium
conﬁguration of the ﬂuid distribution has been per-
turbed. According to cracking concept the region for
which square of the transverse speed of sound is smaller
than the square of the radial speed of sound, is a poten-
tially stable region [113,114,115,116,117]. For the sta-
ble matter distribution Herrera [114] and Andr´easson [117]

Here the ﬁrst term represents the gravitational force
(Fg), second term denotes the hydrodynamic force (Fh)
and third term indicates the anisotropic force (Fa). The
fourth term arises due to coupling between the matter
and the geometry, which can be termed as the force due
to modiﬁed gravity (Fmg). So we can conclude that sum
of all the forces are zero, i.e., Fg + Fh + Fa + Fmg = 0,
which implies that our system is completely stable.

The modiﬁed form of the energy momentum tensor in
the framework of f (R, T ) gravity is presented in Eq. (7).
Hence the modiﬁed form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-

Fig. 6 shows the variation of diﬀerent forces with
respect to the radius of the star. From the pictorial rep-
resentation it is clear that inward pull of Fg is counter
balanced by the combined eﬀect of Fh, Fa and Fmg
which acts along outward direction. For χ = 0 the usual
form of TOV equation as in GR will be retrieved be-
cause in this situation the force due to modiﬁed gravity
vanishes, i.e., eﬀect of coupling vanishes.

sity proﬁle [118]. It can be used to study stability of
a relativistic and non relativistic ﬂuid sphere. Accord-
ing to Chandrasekhar [119] the dynamical stability of
the stellar model can be checked against an inﬁnitesi-
mal radial adiabatic perturbation. Later on several re-
searchers [120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127] used the
idea to diﬀerent astrophysical system.

According to this stability condition Γ must be greater
than 4
3 . For an anisotropic ﬂuid sphere Γ can be rep-
resented as Γr and Γt, the radial adiabatic index and
tangential adiabatic index respectively [128]. Chan et
al. [115] and Heinzmann [129] predicted that adiabatic
index should exceed 4
3 inside an anisotropic, relativistic
and dynamically stable stellar system. Γr and Γt can
be expressed mathematically as follows
Γr = ρef f +pef f
Γt = ρef f +pef f

5.3.4 Equation of State (EOS)

The simplest form of the barotropic equation of state
can be represented as pi = ωiρ, where ωi are the param-
eters along the radial and transverse direction. Since
we have considered the anisotropic strange star under
f (R, T ) gravity our radial and transverse EOS param-
eter will be given by as follows:

and ωef f

For simplicity we have considered the ﬂuid distribu-
tion to be spatially homogeneous, though diﬀerent lit-
erature survey [130,131,132,133] shows the possibility
of space and time dependency of ω. From the graphical
representation of EOS (Fig. 8) it is clear that 0 < ωi <
1
3 , i.e., the matter content of our proposed model is
non-exotic in nature [102] and decreases monotonically
towards the surface of the star.

5.3.5 Harrison-Zel′dovich-Novikov static stability
criteria

According to Harrison et al. [134] and Zel′dovich and
Novikov [135] the adiabatic index of a slowly deformed
matter is comparable with that of a pulsating star. This
result states that for a stable conﬁguration the nature
of the mass will be increasing with respect to the central
density (i.e., dM
> 0) and for an unstable conﬁguration

a signiﬁcant role in determining the compactiﬁcation
factor of the strange stars in f (R, T ) gravity.

for an anisotropic star can reach maximum higher value

according to Ivanov [89] maximum acceptable value of
surface redshift will be 5.211.

6 Discussions and concluding remarks

Motivation of this work is to study the relativistic strange
star under the framework of f (R, T ) gravity where spher-
ically symmetric spacetime is of Tolman-Kuchowicz type.
With the help of SQM distribution, demonstrated as in
the famous MIT bag EOS [Eq. (15)], we explore strange
quark star. As anisotropic matter distribution is con-
sidered here, incorporation of the EOS does not make
the system over determined. Solving EFEs [Eqs. (9)-
(11)] in modiﬁed gravity, using Tolman-Kuchowicz met-
ric as well as MIT bag EOS, we have obtained diﬀer-
ent physical parameters. Numerical values of diﬀerent
physical quantities have been calculated and shown in
tabular form and their graphical variations have been
shown w.r.t. the radial co-ordinate r. Though graph-
ical representation has been made for the candidate
P SR J 1614 2230, we have shown the respective values
for diﬀerent strange star candidates, like V ela X

Geometry of the space-time can be speciﬁed by the
metric potentials ν(r) and λ(r). From variation of ν(r)
and λ(r) in Fig. 1, it’s clear that eν(r)(r = 0)
= 0 and
positive Also eλ(r)(r = 0) = 1, which are the necessary
conditions to achieve the non-singular solutions from
physical as well as geometrical aspects. Both the func-
tions eν(r)) and eλ(r) increases non-linearly toward the
surface from the center.

In f (R, T ) gravity, a constant χ arises due to the
coupling between matter and geometry. Assuming χ =

1 in anisotropic condition, we can calculate the bag con-
stant Bg which remains in the range (47-48) MeV/fm3,
though the predicted range for stable SQM matter dis-
tribution is (55-75) MeV/fm3 [67,60] in GR. However,
very recently Aziz et. al [141] have discussed about the
possible wide range (41.58-319.31) MeV/fm3 for Bg on
the basis of observational data for diﬀerent strange star
candidates. In our model the coupling parameter χ ef-
fectively reduces to Bg in case of f (R, T ) gravity. In-
corporating χ = 0 in anisotropic condition, we get Bg
in the range (68-69) MeV/fm3. Biswas et al. [70] have
previously shown that χ is blameworthy behind this
eﬀective reduction of Bg. The coupling constant plays
a very crucial role to study the strange star. Depend-
ing on its value we can study diﬀerent aspect of Bag
constant.

Bauswein and his co-workers [142,143] predicted a
strange star-strange star merger process which increases
the probability of SQM hypothesis if one can detect
Gravitational Wave from this merging phenomenon. It
is to note that some simple features of the GW signals
may reveals whether Strange Star (SS) or Neutron Star
(NS) merger had produced the emission. In case of SS
mergering, the maximal frequency during the inspiral
and the frequency of ringdown of the postmerging rem-
nant are higher than those of NS merging. A particular
choice of the EOS will make the frequencies similar for
SS and NS merging procedure. In such a case one can
take the help of Gravitational Wave luminosity spec-
trum to reveal the features. As a result to diﬀerenti-
ate between NS and SS merging one can use the ratio
of energy emitted during the inspiral phase to the en-
ergy radiated away in the postmerger stage. Hopefully,
the upcoming advanced GW detectors LIGO [144,145]
and VIRGO [146] may provide more valuable data re-
garding the signals from high density compact object
binaries [147].

Other forms of self-bound matter like pion conden-
sation may lead to the stellar objects similar to SS [148,
149,150]. So we can generalize our study to these states
of matter also provided we have the knowledge of the
speciﬁc EOS. In addition to GW measurements the
cooling history of NS, SS and self-bound pion condensed
stars are diﬀerent [81,151,152,153]. Since merger rem-
nants are the promising source to develop better under-
standing regarding the origin of GW spectra, one can
claim in future a better understanding of SS and BH
through SS-BH merger.

Now the current study can be summarized as fol-

lows:

(i) Density and pressure: The eﬀective density,
eﬀective radial and tangential pressure are maximum
at the center of the star and decrease monotonically

towards the surface of the star, shown in the Fig. 3
as well as in Table 2. However, it is to be noted that
the eﬀective density at the surface of the star reduces to
34.56 % of its value at the center. The anisotropic stress
is minimum at the center of the star and increases non-
linearly with the radius of the star and acquire the max-
imum value at the surface of the system. The tremen-
dous pressure at the center make the system ultra com-
pact object. The spheroidicity in our system arises due
to this maximum anisotropic force at the surface of the
star. The pictorial variation of EOS Fig. 8 states clearly
that 0 < ωi < 1
3 , i.e., our system consists of non-exotic
matter.

(ii) TOV equation: In f (R, T ) gravity, our pro-
posed model satisﬁes the force condition, i.e., the gener-
alized TOV equation [Eq. 25]. From Fig. 6, it is distinct
that the eﬀect of gravitational force (Fg) stabilizes the
uniﬁed eﬀect of hydrostatic force (Fh), anisotropic force
(Fa) and the newly modiﬁed gravity force (Fmg), orig-
inated due to the matter-geometry coupling in f (R, T )
gravity.

(iii) Energy Conditions: Our system is consis-
tence with all the energy conditions, e.g. NEC, WEC,
SEC and DEC for both the radial and tangential cases
of pressure. Variations of all these conditions have been
shown graphically (Fig. 4) which re-conﬁrms the phys-
ical stability and acceptability of proposed model.

(iv) Stability: To examine the stability of the sys-
tem, we have checked Herrera’s cracking condition and
v2
rs < 1
the causality conditions as
rs −
and 0 < v2
ts < 1. Fig. 5 also manifest that all the in-
equality criteria are well satisﬁed This enhances the

physical acceptability of the system with the background
of sound velocity of the system.

From Fig. 7, it’s clear that both the adiabatic indices
(i.e., Γr and Γt) remain within the critical value 4
3 [128]
through out the system which establish that inﬁnites-
imal adiabatic perturbation can’t distort the stability
of the model. Harrison-Zel′dovich-Novikov’s static sta-
bility criteria is well satisﬁed, Fig. 9 shows that dm
is
dρc
always positive throughout the system.

(v) Buchdahl condition: Variation of the eﬀec-
tive mass has been featured in Fig. 10 (upper panel)
which emphasizes the regularity of M (r)ef f as for r

features highly recommend for a strange star candi-

tinuously from center to surface. The surface redshift

At this point we would like to conduct a compara-
tive study between our work in f (R, T ) gravity and that
of the investigations by other authors [156,157,158], es-
pecially by Asthashenok et al. [157] in f (R) gravity
which are as follows:
(i) In f (R) gravity, f (R) contains 1st and higher order
terms of scalar curvature R, connected through a con-

12

stant parameter α. Setting α = 0 gives the simpler form
as f (R) = R. But in our work of f (R, T ) gravity, where
Ricci scalar R and the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor T are connected through a coupling constant pa-
rameter χ, arises due to the matter-geometry coupling.
(ii) In the above study, α is the key factor and dif-
ferent results with the variation of α have been investi-
gated in their study whereas in our case the key factor
is χ and setting χ = 0 gives the results for GR as well
as non-zero χ represents the alternative gravity.

(iii) The study [157] is based on general relativistic
stars like neutron stars and quark stars. It’s not explic-
itly clear whether the model is energetically stable or
not. Our study is speciﬁcally based on strange quark
stars where we have calculated diﬀerent unknown pa-
rameters like the matter density, radial and tangential
pressure, value of EOS parameter, redshift etc. Besides,
consistency of our model with various stability condi-
tions at a time, is also worthy to mention.

(iv) Though Asthashenok et al. [157] in their study
have also mentioned about the MIT bag model EOS
and and hence bag constant Bg. But, here we have cal-
culated the range for Bg in f (R, T ) gravity. We have
also shown that value of Bg reduces in f (R, T ) due to
the eﬀect of χ. Setting χ = 0 one can get the higher
value of Bg which exactly matches to the predicted
range [67,60].

In connection to the above comparative discussion
we would also like to make comments on the current
article regarding strange stars that the study shows re-
markably diﬀerent results in comparison to the earlier
works [159,160,161,162,163]. Here, one can ﬁnd a very
interesting feature that the value of bag constant Bg
gets eﬀected under modiﬁed gravity. However, the new
results can be mentioned as follows:

(i) In this study, we have shown the existence of sta-
ble strange quark stars with lower bag value in the range
(47-48) Mev/fm3 whereas earlier works obtained [159,
160] or assumed [161,162,163] Bg in the higher range
for strange star models in GR [159,160] as well as in the
modiﬁed theories of gravity [161,162,163]. Our calcula-
tions in this study, therefore, clearly illustrate the ef-
fect of f (R; T ) gravity. Here, the matter-geometry cou-
pling constant χ, eﬀectively reduces the value of Bg.
Besides, minimization of the matter-geometry coupling
(i.e. χ = 0) in this study, gives back the higher val-
ues of Bg in the range (55-75) Mev/fm3 as proposed by
Farhi [67] and Alcock [60] for stable strange star model.
(ii) Following the literature [159,160,161,162,163],
we have studied all the energy conditions, TOV equa-
tion, Herrera’s cracking conditions, Buchdahl limit, adi-
abatic index and the EOS parameter. We have also
shown the variations of all these parameters w.r.t. r

for strange star candidate PSR J 1614 2230. Our pro-
posed model of anisotropic strange star with Tolman-
Kuchowicz metric under modiﬁed f (R, T ) gravity, shows
it’s consistency with all the stability criteria and indi-
cates the physical acceptability and stability. Proposed
model also satisfy the Harrison-Zel’dovich-Novikov cri-
teria for stability. It’s mention worthy that no earlier
work [159,160,161,162,163] shows it’s consistency with
all the static stability criteria as our study does eﬀec-
tively.

We ﬁnally comment that our model is completely
free from both physical and geometrical singularities
and represents a strange quark star with highly dense
SQM distribution. It can be observed that under f (R, T )
gravity, study of anisotropic strange star using Tolman-
Kuchowicz metric, provides such a model which satisfy
all the stability criteria and perfect for studying dif-
ferent features of anisotropic strange stars. Along with
this, another fascinating feature is the reduction in bag
value. The coupling constant χ caused due to the cou-
pling between matter and geometry, eﬀectively reduces
Bg and also the value of v2
3 ) in
GR. For both the cases, χ = 0 retrieves the result that
exactly matches to GR results. However, as our model
works well within the low range (47-48) MeV/fm3 for
χ = 1 and (68-69) MeV/fm3 for χ = 0, therefore the
present investigation may be generalized by consider-
ing more realistic EOS obtained from QCD simula-
tions [155] to make it also suitable for the higher range
(41.58-319.31) MeV/fm3 [141].
