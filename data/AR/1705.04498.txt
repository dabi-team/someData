We report on studies of collisions between 3 keV Ar+ projectile ions and neutral targets of isolated
1,3-butadiene (C4H6) molecules and cold, loosely bound clusters of these molecules. We identify
molecular growth processes within the molecular clusters that appears to be driven by knockout
processes and that could result in the formation of (aromatic) ring structures. These types of
reactions are not unique to speciﬁc projectile ions and target molecules, but will occur whenever
atoms or ions with suitable masses and kinetic energies collide with aggregates of matter, such
as carbonaceous grains in the interstellar medium or aerosol nanoparticles in the atmosphere.

1 Introduction

Carbon forms the basis of the majority of the molecular species
that so far have been identiﬁed in space 1. Although small
carbon-based molecules, like CO, are some of the most abundant
molecules in space, only a small fraction of the carbon is expected
to be locked up in such species 1. Instead a large portion of the in-
terstellar carbon—perhaps more than 10 percent—is expected to
be contained in some of the largest molecules identiﬁed in space,
such as the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the
fullerenes 2,3. Since the 1980s 4–6, PAH molecules have been sug-
gested to be carriers of unidentiﬁed emission bands in the near
infrared that are observed on top of the IR continua from dust
grains in many regions of space. These bands are generally con-
sidered to arise from the characteristic C–C and C–H stretching
modes of aromatic rings, but because these signatures are nearly
the same for all PAH types, no individual PAH species has been
identiﬁed so far in the interstellar medium (ISM) 1.
Individual
fullerenes (C60 and C70), on the other hand, have been identiﬁed
in the IR emission spectra of planetary nebulae 7 and reﬂection
nebulae 8, and more recently C+
60 has been identiﬁed as a carrier
of four diffuse interstellar bands 9,10.

Despite the anticipated ubiquity of PAHs and fullerenes in
space, the mechanisms for formation and growth of aromatic
systems in these environments remain largely unknown. Sev-
eral experimental and theoretical studies on the growth of PAHs

and fullerenes have revealed a number of bottom-up processes
where carbon rings are formed through the sequential addition of
11–19.
small hydrocarbon building blocks such as CH3 and C2H2
However, the applicability of such chemical processes to inter-
stellar environments is limited by low densities and fragile re-
action intermediates, which are likely to photodissociate before
they may grow further in the harsh environment of the ISM 20.
Instead, top-down models are often used to predict the forma-
tion of fullerene cages in the ISM through the decay of larger
carbon-based complexes 21, e.g. large PAHs (the formation paths
of which also are poorly known), when these are processed by
energetic photons 3,22,23, e.g. by the intense UV radiation ﬁelds in
planetary nebulae, or particles 24, e.g. by energetic atoms/ions in
supernova shockwaves.

Recently it has been shown that keV ions colliding with loosely
bound clusters of PAHs or fullerenes can induce molecular growth
within these clusters 25–29. This growth is mainly driven by the
prompt fragmentation of molecules in cluster when the impact-
ing projectile ion deposits a large amount of energy and momen-
tum to individual atoms through nuclear scattering processes 29.
When enough energy is transferred in such processes, atoms can
be knocked out from the individual molecules in the cluster, creat-
ing secondary projectiles (the atoms that have been knocked out
may cause further damage) and fragments with dangling bonds.
These remaining molecular fragments are often highly reactive
and may form covalent bonds with neighboring molecules in the
cluster on sub-picosecond timescales. That is, well before the ex-
cited cluster dissociates 29. The surrounding molecules are impor-
tant here as they provide fuel for the reactions and dissipate some
of the excess energy. This helps to cool the reaction products and
protects them from secondary statistical fragmentation 29.

The elastic nuclear scattering that initiates reactions in PAH and
fullerene clusters is often the main mechanism for energy trans-
fer when atoms, ions, or molecules collide at energies below a few
keV (the exact limit varies depending on the projectile) 29,30. At
higher collision energies, energy is mainly transferred through in-
elastic electronic scattering processes that excites the electrons in
the target in a similar way as in photo-absorption processes 29–31.
In most cases, most of the energy that is transferred to the target
by either mechanism will be redistributed, e.g. by internal conver-
sions from electronically to vibrationally excited states, over all

will then typically cool by dissociating through their lowest en-
ergy pathways 29 and/or by emitting photons 5,32, typically pro-
ducing at most one reactive product. The prompt knockout of
atoms on the other hand is a process unique to energy transfer
through nuclear scattering by heavy particles and often leads to
the formation of multiple highly reactive fragments 29.
In addi-
tion to the reactions in PAH and fullerene clusters 25–29, knockout
driven fragmentation has been detected in experiments with iso-
lated C60 anions 33,34, C60 cations 35, and PAH cations 35,36. The
balance between nuclear and electronic scattering can be stud-
ied choosing different projectiles ions and energies—slow and
heavy projectile ions interact mainly through nuclear scattering,
and fast and light ions interact mainly through electronic scat-
tering. Furthermore, the importance of both processes and the
reaction dynamics may also depend on the structure and size of
the irradiated molecule, and whether the molecule is isolated or
in a cluster. It has for example been shown that radical cations
such as C8H•
can be formed through electron impact ionization
8
of clusters of small hydrocarbon chain molecules such as acety-
37. Thus, it appears that simple ionization may also

Here we investigate if impulse driven (knockout) reactions like
those observed in PAH and fullerene clusters can drive the growth
of small hydrocarbon chains into larger structures and to form
aromatic molecules from non-aromatic ones. In the next two sec-
tions we present the experimental setup and theoretical methods
that we use here. We then move on to show and compare exper-
imental and theoretical results for 3 keV Ar+ ions colliding with
isolated 1,3-butadiene (C4H6) molecules and their loosely bound
clusters. We ﬁnd that these collisions result in a wealth of molec-
ular growth products that could include aromatic rings.

2 Experimental Details

The experimental part of this work was performed at the ARIBE
low energy ion facility at GANIL in Caen, France, using the
crossed beam apparatus 42 shown schematically in Figure 1. The
butadiene target was supplied from a bottle which fed gas into
a cluster aggregation source.
In experiments involving molecu-
lar clusters, the cluster source is cooled with liquid nitrogen at
77 K and a He buffer gas is injected to aid the cooling of the bu-
tadiene gas, which then condenses into clusters with a broad log-
normal size distribution 42. It is not possible to isolate individual
cluster sizes with the present setup. Beams of isolated molecular
(monomer) targets are formed in the same way, but with the clus-
ter source operating at ambient temperature. The neutral clusters

or molecules, depending on which of the targets that is prepared,
leave the source through a nozzle and pass a differential pump-
ing stage before entering the interaction region of the experiment
where they cross with the keV ion beam. The 3 keV Ar+ ions
are produced by means of an ion gun and standard equipment to
yield 3.0 µs long pulses.

The interaction region is placed in the extraction zone in a
Wiley-McLaren time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer 43. After the ion-
beam pulse has left this region, the extraction voltage of the mass
spectrometer is applied and positively charged products are ac-
celerated into the ﬁeld free region. The charged products then
hit a position sensitive 80 mm microchannel plate (MCP) detec-

tor (biased to
time-of-ﬂight of each charged product (with respect to the time
when the extraction voltage is switched on) is recorded with ns

3 Computational Details

Following the approach successfully used to model collision in-
duced molecular growth in PAH clusters 28, we have performed
classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of neutral Ar
atoms colliding with 1,3-butadiene clusters. We used the AIREBO
(Adaptive Intermolecular Reactive Empirical Bond Order) poten-
tial 44 to describe the chemical interactions between C and H
atoms in the molecules as well as non-bonding dispersive forces
between molecules. The AIREBO potential is a reactive potential
that allows for bonds to be formed and broken dynamically dur-
ing the simulation based on the bond order and type of each atom
and its neighbors. The interactions between the projectile and the
clusters were described using the ZBL (Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark)
potential 45, a screened Coulomb potential for modeling nuclear
scattering processes. These classical force ﬁelds do not contain an
explicit description of charge or polarization. However, previous
results have shown that these methods still produce results that

are in good agreement with experiments and higher level theory
where charged reaction products are studied 25,27,28. We used the
LAMMPS package 46 and the forceﬁelds as deﬁned therein for the
present simulations.

The simulations were performed by ﬁrst generating a system of
50 closely separated C4H6 molecules with random orientations.
We then optimized the geometry of the cluster using the AIREBO
potential. The resulting cluster has a compact structure and a
binding energy (from dispersion forces) of 190 meV per molecule.
This cluster geometry (shown in Fig. 2) was used for all of the
classical MD simulations performed here. For each simulation
run, the cluster was positioned with its center-of-mass at the ori-
gin of a three-dimensional coordinate system and was then ran-
domly rotated around this origin. The Ar projectile atom was ﬁred
with a randomly selected impact parameter (with the respect to
the origin of the coordinate system) towards the cluster from a
position 20 Å away. The collision occurs within the ﬁrst few fs of
the simulation and the system was followed for a total simulation
17 s). At the end of
time of 10 ps (using a time step of 5
a simulation the positions of all the atoms were analyzed to de-
termine which covalent bonds have been broken and which new
ones that have been formed. We repeated this simulation process
10,000 times to produce a mass spectrum. Figure 2 shows an
Ar + [C4H6]50 system at the ﬁrst time step of a simulation run.
We have tested the simulation with different cluster sizes. The
size has little effect on the types of reactions that take place in
the clusters—i.e. on the simulated fragment mass spectrum—but
as expected larger clusters give greater reaction probabilities for
geometrical reasons.

In addition, we have performed Density Functional Theory

(DFT) calculations to determine the relative stability of the dif-
ferent isomers of a given molecular species (molecular growth
product) that is formed in the collisions. The complete sets of the
very large number of possible isomers for each studied reaction
product were generated using the Open Molecule Generator 47.
In a ﬁrst step we optimized all of these structures at the B3LYP/3-
21G level of theory. The lowest energy isomers (those within
2 eV of the lowest energy structure) were then re-optimized at the
B3LYP/CC-pVDZ level of theory. For these systems we also per-
formed a frequency analysis to ensure that real energy minima
had been found. These DFT calculations were performed using
the Gaussian 09 software 48.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Collisions with isolated butadiene molecules

In Figure 3 we show a mass spectrum for 3 keV Ar+ ions colliding
with isolated butadiene molecules (by operating the cluster source
at room temperature and without the buffer gas).

The fragment mass spectrum exhibits strong peaks from H-
loss (without C-loss) resulting in fragments down to C4H+ at
49 amu/e. We also see an odd-even effect in the number of
H atoms for the C4H+
fragments with the odd-numbered frag-
x
ments (which have closed electronic shells) being signiﬁcantly
more abundant than those with even numbers of H atoms. Other
notable features are the strong peaks due to C2H+
4 , and
C3H+
3 fragments. The latter is the main dissociation product ob-
served in photodissociation 49 and electron impact 50 experiments
with 1,3-butadiene. However, here we observe a wider range of
fragment sizes than in the photodissociation experiments 49, and
more small fragments, e.g. C2H+
4 , than in the electron im-
pact experiments 50. These differences could be caused by the
molecules having higher excitation energies in our experiments,
but could also be inﬂuenced by knockout-driven fragmentation.

[C4H6]+
2 . For the products with 9 C atoms, the odd-even effect
for the number of H atoms is not observed.

In the right panel of Figure 5 we show a mass spectrum from
our MD simulations of 3 keV Ar atoms colliding with [C4H6]50
clusters. Qualitatively the simulations agree with the experi-
mental results in that there are many different growth products
formed in the collisions. However, the simulations predict much
broader distributions in the number of H atoms in products with
any given number of C atoms than what we observe in the ex-
periments (especially for the products with 7 or less C atoms).
As was seen in experiments on clusters of pyrene 28, the main
growth mechanism is that individual molecules are promptly de-
stroyed by the impinging projectile (knockout) and that the frag-
ments rapidly form bonds with neighboring molecules on sub-
picosecond timescales. The differences we see here between the
experiments and simulations with 3 keV Ar suggest that secondary
fragmentation, where the newly formed molecules undergo addi-
tional fragmentation, plays a much more important role here than
in the case of molecular growth inside pyrene clusters. The sim-
ulated and experimental results are much closer to each other in
the case with pyrene clusters 28. Another important factor for the
survival of reaction products could be the role of charge, which
is not included in the present classical simulations. For larger
molecules, like PAHs and fullerenes with their many delocalized
electrons, the reactivity and stability is largely the same regardless
of whether the molecule is neutral or a singly-charged cation 27.
This is, however, likely not the case for smaller molecules like
those that we detect here. The presence of “magic” (particu-
larly stable/abundant) growth products in the experimental mass
spectrum (left panel of Figure 5) does indeed suggest that the
charge of the molecules affects their stability, in particular since
the strongest features (C4H+
9 , C7H+
7 , C5H+
7 , C6H+
7 ,
C7H+
11 etc.) all have closed-shell electronic structures. De-
spite the differences between the experimental and theoretical
results, both are consistent with prompt knockout of individual
atoms acting as the main mechanism responsible for driving the
ﬁrst steps of the bond-forming reactions. However, we can not
rule out that other processes, e.g. heating of the clusters though
electronic scattering or through the formation of radicals by ion-
ization, also play a role in the growth processes we observe. As
an example, photoionization of ethylene (C2H4) clusters by syn-
chrotron radiation has been shown to induce molecular growth
in those systems 40.

formed Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of all possi-
ble isomers for a given number of C and H atoms. Due to the
increasingly large number of isomers possible for some of the

clusters produced in collisions with 3 keV Ar+ projectiles. The numbers

cluster size.

4.2 Collisions with butadiene clusters

When cooling the cluster aggregation source to 77 K the 1,3-
butadiene molecules condense into weakly bound clusters. Fig-
ure 4 shows an overview mass spectrum of intact, singly ionized
clusters ranging in sizes of up to at least 17 molecules from col-
lisions between these neutral clusters and the 3 keV Ar+ projec-
tiles. These charged clusters are mainly formed when the pro-
jectile ions capture an electron from the neutral clusters at large
distances, leaving the charged clusters with low internal energies.
Due to the low binding energy of the butadiene clusters (190 meV
in our MD simulations of large clusters, 120 meV per molecule
in DFT calculations of dimers 51), even the low excitation ener-
gies involved when the clusters are ionized, together with other
processes such as ion induced dipole interactions within in the
charged clusters, could be enough to induce some cluster dissoci-
ation. This dissociation primarily takes place through the evapo-
ration of intact molecular monomers from the charged clusters.

In the left panel of Figure 5 we present a zoom-in of the same
mass spectrum as in Fig. 4, focusing on the region from the intact
molecular cation up to a mass above that of the molecular dimer.
We see that a wide range of products with mass-to-charge ratios
greater than C4H+
6 (54 amu/e) are detected. The most prominent
peak in this spectrum corresponds to the protonated butadiene
cation, C4H+
7 . In addition, we measure peaks over a wide range
of masses from molecules consisting of between 5 and 9 C atoms,
each with different distributions of the number of H atoms. The

odd numbers of H atoms mostly are signiﬁcantly more abundant
than those with even numbers. The only exception to this is the

exception of C5H+
8 , cyclic structures are more stable than the low-
est energy open structures. We see that the energy difference be-
tween open and cyclic structures varies signiﬁcantly, and is nearly
2 eV in the case of C6H+
6 . Our classical MD simulations show that
most growth products are created when small fragments form co-
valent bonds with intact C4H6 molecules. Products formed in this
way will initially have open structures, which in many cases have
high potential energies relative to the cyclic ground states. As the
reaction products relax into lower energy structures, this excess
potential energy will be converted into vibrational energy that
could lead to secondary fragmentation (together with the energy
deposited in the collisions). This, together with the large energy
differences between open and cyclic isomers could help explain
why some products, e.g. C5H+
6 , are less abundant than
other similarly sized products.

tive peaks in the experimental mass spectrum for the 3 keV Ar+

cillations in the δ -values between different molecules agree with
the odd-even effects that we ﬁnd in the abundances of reaction
products formed in the experiments. This qualitative agreement
supports the idea that an initially broad size distribution of hot

Journal Name, [year], [vol.],reaction products in our simulated mass spectrum can result in
distributions with “magic” features (as seen in the experiments)
through losses of H atoms. However, since δ only compares the
stability of a molecule with those nearest in size, it essentially rep-
resents the relative stability of these molecules against the loss of
single H atoms. It is also likely that the molecules formed in a
decaying cluster could lose not only individual H atoms, but also
one or more C atoms or H2 molecules. This means that a com-
plete theoretical description of the secondary fragmentation that
reshapes the reaction products would have to consider other sta-
tistical fragmentation channels in addition to single H-loss (see
e.g. Refs. 53,54).

5 Summary and Conclusions

We have shown that keV ions colliding with loosely bound clus-
ters of 1,3-butadiene can induce bond-forming reactions. As in
the case of ion-induced reactions in PAH 28 and fullerene clus-
ters 25,26, the present reactions could also be initiated when atoms
are knocked out of molecules via Rutherford-like ion-atom scat-
tering processes. The fragments that are initially formed in such
ways are often highly reactive and form covalent bonds with
neighboring molecules on sub-picosecond timescales. Our clas-
sical MD simulations indicate that a wide range of molecular
growth products are formed also in the present collisions between
3 keV Ar+ ions and clusters of butadiene (C4H6) molecules. How-
ever, in the experiment we mainly observe particularly stable,
“magic” structures, which most likely is due to fast dissociation
of the less stable reaction products.. The most abundant of the
growth products which we observe are C5H+
7 . Our
DFT calculations show that the most stable isomers of these (and
of other abundant reactions products) have ring structures. Fur-
ther, the measured ﬁnal size distribution of the reaction products
can be understood in terms of their calculated relative stabilities.
These ﬁndings suggest that we are indeed forming cyclic rings
from initially linear molecules. The similarities between our ex-
perimental and simulated mass spectra suggest that the very fast
atom knockout processes that are included in these simulations
play important roles. However, it cannot be excluded that also

7 and C6H+

other types of processes such as electronic excitation processes or
ionization processes also can initiate molecular growth—in par-
ticular in clusters of smaller molecules.

The reactions that we have discussed in this work are likely to
occur whenever energetic particles with suitable combinations of
mass, charge, and kinetic energy collide with aggregates of mat-
ter, such as when supernova shockwaves interact with carbon-
based dust grains in the interstellar medium (ISM) 24. In this con-
text it is important to note that argon (Ar) is signiﬁcantly heavier
than the ionic species most commonly found in space 24. How-
ever, the present molecular growth products are believed to be
quite general and will most likely occur for different types of pro-
jectiles depending on the amount of energy deposited through nu-
clear scattering. In general, this processes is the dominant mech-
anism for energy transfer in slow collisions (like those discussed
here). We thus expect the knockout driven molecular growth to
be important in shocks, where H and He atoms/ions with kinetic
energies up to a few hundred eV, and C atoms/ions with ener-
gies up to a few keV are abundant 24.
In the future, it will be
interesting to perform a systematic investigation of the relative
importance of ionization and of electronic and nuclear stopping
processes for molecular growth inside clusters of small hydrocar-
bon molecules.
