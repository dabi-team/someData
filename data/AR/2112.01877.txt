NA61/SHINE (SPS Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment) is a ﬁxed target experiment located
at the CERN SPS. Its strong interactions program is devoted to study properties of the phase
diagram of strongly interacting matter. For this goal the two-dimensional scan is performed by
measurements of hadron production properties as a function of collision energy (13A - 158A
GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This contribution presents
new results on the onset of deconﬁnement - the transition between the state of hadronic matter
and the quark-gluon plasma. Also, new results on ﬂuctuations and correlations devoted to the
search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter will be presented. Obtained results are
compared with the available data from other experiments and from various theoretical models.

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE [1] at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is a ﬁxed-target experiment
pursuing a rich physics program including measurements for strong interactions, neutrino, and
cosmic ray physics.

Among the aims of the strong interactions program is to search for the critical point (CP)
and study of the onset of deconﬁnement (OD) of strongly interacting matter. NA61/SHINE is the
ﬁrst experiment which explores the phase diagram of strongly-interacting matter by performing a
two-dimensional scan, in beam momentum (13A – 150/158A GeV/c) and size of colliding system
(p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This is exactly the energy range where indications
of OD were reported [2]. Such a scan allows for a rare possibility for measurements of strong
interactions at different conditions with similar detector set-up. The illustration of the scan as well
as list of gathered and planed system/energies are shown in Fig. 1 along with the illustration of the
phase-diagram of strongly interacting matter.

This contribution discusses new results on the OD studies as well as on the search for the CP.

2. Study of the onset of deconﬁnement

The Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [3] predicts several signatures of the 1st order
phase transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons. In the transition region, constant temperature
and pressure in the mixed-phase and an increase of the number of internal degrees of freedom is
expected.

Figure 2 (left) presents energy and system-size dependence of K+/π + ratio at mid-rapidity ob-
tained by NA61/SHINE in p+p [4], Be+Be [5] and Ar+Sc (preliminary); and NA49 in Pb+Pb [6].
The so-called horn in the K+/π + ratio was predicted within SMES as one of the signatures of the
OD. The data were compared with few dynamical models (see right top panel of Fig. 2). Those
without phase transition (EPOS [7, 8], UrQMD [9] and SMASH [10]) agree with the results from
small systems (p+p and Be+Be), while do not describe the results from heavier systems (Ar+Sc and
Pb+Pb). In contrast, the model with phase transition (PHSD [11]), follows the trend observed at

models: renormalised SMES [12] (with the phase transition) and HRG [13] (without it) overesti-
mate the K+/π + ratio especially in small systems (see right bottom panel of Fig. 2). The energy
and system-size dependence of another signature - the so-called kink, is shown in Fig. 3. It presents
the dependence of the ratio of the mean number of pions to the mean number of wounded nucleons

Pb+Pb interactions. The behavior of Ar+Sc stands in contradiction to Be+Be measurements, which
are close to the Pb+Pb results except for the top SPS beam energy.

Spatial asymmetry of the initial energy density in the overlapping region of the colliding rel-
ativistic nuclei is converted to the asymmetry of momentum distribution of particles in the ﬁnal
state. The resulting asymmetry carries information about the transport properties of the created
quark and gluons system. Asymmetry is usually quantiﬁed with vn coefﬁcients in a Fourier de-
composition of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles relative to the reaction plane. The
Projectile Spectator Detector allows NA61/SHINE to estimate the reaction plane in a unique way
(for details see Refs. [15, 16]).

The slope of proton directed ﬂow at mid-rapidity, dv1/dy, at considered energy range it is
expected to change its sign [17, 18, 19]. Directed ﬂow of π − and p as well as dv1/dy (centrality
dependence) for Pb+Pb collisions at 13A and 30A GeV/c is presented in Fig. 4. Shapes of v1(pT )

ﬂow of π − starts with negative values and than changes sign (Fig. 4, center). There is also a clear
difference of the v1 slope between 13A and 30A GeV/c (Fig. 4, center and right).

3. Search for the critical point

The expected signal of a critical point (CP) is a non-monotonic dependence of various ﬂuctu-
ation/correlation measures in NA61/SHINE energy – system size scan. Fluctuations of conserved
charges (electric, strangeness or baryon number) are of special interest [20, 21, 22].

To compare ﬂuctuations in systems of different sizes, one should use quantities insensitive
to system volume, i.e. intensive quantities. They are constructed by division of cumulants κi of
the measured multiplicity distribution (up to fourth order), where i is the order of the cumulant.
For second, third and fourth order cumulants intensive quantities are deﬁned as: κ2/κ1, κ3/κ2 and
κ4/κ2. Their reference values for no ﬂuctuations are 0 and for independent particle production are
1. In case of net-charge, cumulant ratios are redeﬁned to κ2/(κ1[h+] − κ1[h−]), κ3/κ1[h+ − h−]
and κ4/κ2[h+ − h−] in order to keep the same references.

Figure 5 shows the system size and energy dependence of second, third and fourth order cu-
mulant ratio of net-electric charge in p+p as well as central Be+Be and Ar+Sc interactions. So far,

there is no clear difference between systems for higher order moments. More detailed studies are
needed.

Another, possible tool for search of CP is a proton intermittency.

In the proximity of CP
a local power-law ﬂuctuations of the baryon density should appear which can be searched for
by studying second factorial moments, F2(δ ) = (cid:104) 1
i=1 ni(cid:105)2 with the cell size or, equivalently,
with the number of cells in (px, py ) space of protons at mid-rapidity [23, 24, 25]. NA61/SHINE
measures F2(M) using using statistically independent points and cumulative variables. Preliminary
results on F2(M) of mid-rapidity protons measured in 0-20% most central Ar+Sc collisions at 150A
GeV/c and 0-10% most central Pb+Pb collisions are presented in Fig. 6 in left and right panels,
respectively. The intermittency index φ2 for a system freezing out at the QCD critical endpoint
is expected to be φ2 = 5/6 assuming that the latter belongs to the 3-D Ising universality class.
Measured F2(M) of protons for Ar+Sc at 150A GeV/c and Pb+Pb at 30A GeV/c show no indication
for power-law increase with a bin size which could indicate CP.

mid-rapidity which is not described by studied models. The results on energy dependence of
(cid:104)π(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105) ratio suggests an increase of effective number of degrees of freedom in central Ar+Sc
collisions at top SPS energies. Presented results do not show any indications of the CP in the pre-
sented analysis. Clear separation of small (p+p, Be+Be) and large (Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb) systems for
spectra results does not remain for ﬂuctuations of net-electric charge described by higher-order
cumulants of the distribution.
