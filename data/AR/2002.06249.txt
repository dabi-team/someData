Abstract. Solar coronal dimmings have been observed extensively in the past two decades and
are believed to have close association with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent study found
that coronal dimming is the only signature that could diﬀerentiate powerful ﬂares that have
CMEs from those that do not. Therefore, dimming might be one of the best candidates to observe
the stellar CMEs on distant Sun-like stars. In this study, we investigate the possibility of using
coronal dimming as a proxy to diagnose stellar CMEs. By simulating a realistic solar CME event
and corresponding coronal dimming using a global magnetohydrodynamics model (AWSoM:
Alfv´en-wave Solar Model), we ﬁrst demonstrate the capability of the model to reproduce solar
observations. We then extend the model for simulating stellar CMEs by modifying the input
magnetic ﬂux density as well as the initial magnetic energy of the CME ﬂux rope. Our result
suggests that with improved instrument sensitivity, it is possible to detect the coronal dimming
signals induced by the stellar CMEs.

1. Introduction

“Coronal dimming” refers as the reduction in intensity on or near the solar disk
across a large area during solar eruptive events. It was ﬁrst observed in white light
corona and described as a “depletion” (Hansen et al. 1974) and later was found in so-
lar X-ray observations as “transient coronal holes” (Rust & Hildner 1976). The studies
about coronal dimming dramatically increased with Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO)/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging (EIT) observations (Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995),
with which the coronal dimming was ﬁrst observed in multiple EUV channels with dif-
ferent emission temperatures (Thompson et al. 1998). The coronal dimming was also
found usually associated with coronal EUV waves (also called “EIT waves”, Thompson
et al. 1999). Recently, with EUV observations of unprecedented high temporal (∼12 s)
and spatial resolution (∼0.6 arcsec) in seven channels from Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012)
as well as the high spectral resolution data from SDO/Extreme Ultraviolet Variability

Experiment (EVE; Woods et al. 2012), it provides us an unique opportunity for in-depth
studies about coronal dimming.

Two decades of solar observations suggest that all coronal dimmings are associated
with coronal mass ejections (CMEs; e.g., Sterling & Hudson 1997; Reinard & Biesecker
2008). Furthermore, since observations show simultaneous and co-spatial dimming in
multiple coronal lines (e.g., Zarro et al. 1999; Sterling et al. 2000) and the spectroscopic
observations show that the dimming region has up-ﬂowing expanding plasma (e.g., Harra
& Sterling 2001; Harra et al. 2007; Imada et al. 2007; Jin et al. 2009; Attrill et al. 2010;
Tian et al. 2012), it is widely accepted that the coronal dimming is due to the plasma
evacuation during the CME and the dimming area is believed to be the footpoints of the
erupting ﬂux rope. Recent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modeling results of coronal
dimming (e.g., Cohen et al. 2009; Downs et al. 2012) also suggest that the dimming
is mainly caused by the CME-induced plasma evacuation, and the spatial location is
well correlated with the footpoints of the erupting magnetic ﬂux system (Downs et al.
2015). Although, there are other known mechanisms that could cause coronal dimming
in observations (Mason et al. 2014).

Due to its close association with CMEs, coronal dimming encodes important informa-
tion about CMEs mass, speed, energy etc. (e.g., Hudson et al. 1996; Sterling & Hudson
1997; Harrison et al. 2003; Zhukov & Auch`ere 2004; Aschwanden et al. 2009; Cheng & Qiu
2016; Krista & Reinard 2017; Dissauer et al. 2018a,b), therefore provide critical estima-
tions for space weather forecast. For example, Krista & Reinard (2013) found correlations
between the magnitudes of dimmings/ﬂares and the CME mass by studying variation
between recurring eruptions and dimmings. Using SDO/EVE observations, Mason et al.
(2016) found that the CME velocity/mass can be related to coronal dimming properties
(e.g., dimming depth and dimming slope), which could be used to estimate CME mass
and speed in the space weather forecast operations. On the other hand, by exploring the
characteristics of 42 X-class solar ﬂares, Harra et al. (2016) found that coronal dimming
is the only signature that could diﬀerentiate powerful ﬂares that have CMEs from those
that do not. Therefore, dimming might be one of the best candidates to observe the
stellar CMEs on distant Sun-like stars.

In this study, we ﬁrst model the coronal dimming associated with a realistic CME
event on 2011 February 15 (Schrijver et al. 2011; Jin et al. 2016) to demonstrate the
capability of the model to reproduce solar observations. We then extend the model for
simulating stellar CMEs by changing the input magnetic ﬂux density as well as the initial
energy of the CME ﬂux rope. In §2 we brieﬂy introduce the global MHD model used in
this study, followed by the results and discussion in §3.

2. Global Corona & CME Models

In this study, the model for reconstructing the global corona environment is the Alfv´en
Wave Solar Model (van der Holst et al. 2014) within the Space Weather Modeling Frame-
work (SWMF; T´oth et al. 2012). AWSoM is a data-driven global MHD model with inner
boundary speciﬁed by observed magnetic maps and simulation domain extending from
the upper chromosphere to the corona and heliosphere. Physical processes included in
the model are multi-species thermodynamics, electron heat conduction (both collisional
and collisionless formulations), optically thin radiative cooling, and Alfv´en-wave tur-
bulence that accelerates and heats the solar wind. The Alfv´en-wave description includes
non-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) reﬂection and physics-based apportioning of tur-
bulent dissipative heating to both electrons and protons. AWSoM has demonstrated the

capability to reproduce high-ﬁdelity solar corona conditions (Sokolov et al. 2013; van der
Holst et al. 2014; Oran et al. 2013, 2015; Jin et al. 2016, 2017a).

Based on the steady-state global corona solution, we initiate the CME by using an
analytical Gibson-Low (GL) ﬂux rope model (Gibson & Low 1998). This ﬂux rope model
has been successfully used in numerous modeling studies of CMEs (e.g., Manchester
et al. 2004a,b; Lugaz et al. 2005; Manchester et al. 2014; Jin et al. 2016, 2017a). Jin
et al. (2017b) developed a module (EEGGL) to calculate the GL ﬂux rope parameters
based on near-Sun observations so that this ﬁrst-principles-based MHD model could be
utilized as a forecasting tool. Analytical proﬁles of the GL ﬂux rope are obtained by
ﬁnding a solution to the magnetohydrostatic equation (∇ × B) × B − ∇p − ρg = 0 and
the solenoidal condition ∇ · B = 0. After inserting the ﬂux rope into the steady-state
solar corona solution: i.e. ρ = ρ0 + ρGL, B = B0 + BGL, p = p0 + pGL, the combined
background-ﬂux-rope system is in a state of force imbalance and thus erupts immediately
when the numerical model is advanced forward in time. The simulation setup in this study
is similar to that in our previous work (Jin et al. 2016).

3. Results & Discussion

To demonstrate the capability of the model for reproducing the solar coronal dimming,
we synthesize the EUV emissions of 6 AIA wavebands for two hours after the CME onset
in the 2011 February 15 event (Schrijver et al. 2011; Jin et al. 2016). In addition, we
calculate the Emission Measure (EM) in 4 temperature bins (5.75 < lgT < 6.55). In
Figure 1, we show the core dimming (near the source region) evolution in the simulation.
The left panel in Figure 1 shows a base-diﬀerence image (by substracting the pre-event
intensity) in AIA 211 ˚A at t = 1 hour. The black box shows the sub-region where the
EUV intensities and EMs are derived. In the middle panel of Figure 1, the EUV intensity
evolution (represented by relative changes in percentage comparing with the pre-event
values) in 2 hours for all 6 AIA wavebands is shown. We can see that the intensities in
all 6 wavebands drop, which suggests the plasma depletion included by the CME. This
is also evident in the EM calculation (right panel of Figure 1). By ﬁtting the intensity
curves, we can estimate the dimming recovery time is about ∼9 to 16 hours.

like stars, their coronas are believed to be hotter than the solar case. By varying the
(cid:104)|f B|(cid:105) in the model by 5, 10, 20, 30 times, we demonstrate this eﬀect quantitatively in
Figure 2. With the increasing magnetic ﬁeld strength, the peak EM temperature shifts
from ∼1 MK for the solar case to ∼5 MK for the stellar case with magnetic ﬁeld 30 times
stronger. Note that the peak EM temperature for the solar case is consistent with the
dominant dimming lines in the solar observation (i.e., 171 ˚A and 193 ˚A, with emission
temperatures around 1 MK). Therefore, even without simulating the CMEs, the steady-
state corona solution is useful to estimate the dominant coronal dimming lines in the
stellar cases with diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux densities.

Figure 2. Integrated EM for diﬀerent input magnetic ﬂux densities. “x1” represents the solar
case, and “x30” means the magnetic ﬂux density is 30 times the solar case.

We then initiate CMEs with varying initial energies and into diﬀerent steady-state
coronal conditions. The simulation is switched to time-accurate mode to capture the CME
eruption, and the MHD equations are solved in conservative form to guarantee the energy
conservation during the eruption process. Here, we show two representative cases: one
conﬁned eruption and one explosive eruption. The conﬁned eruption is due to the strong
overlaying global coronal magnetic ﬁeld that prevents the CME to escape (Alvarado-
G´omez et al. 2018). In this case, since there is no plasma depletion involved, the EUV
lines show no dimming features. Instead, due to the redistribution of the magnetic energy
in the corona, it leads to a second peak in some EUV intensity proﬁles as shown in Figure
3. The second peak is more evident in the lines with higher emission temperature (e.g.,
335 ˚A and 284 ˚A), which suggests the coronal plasma is dominant in these temperatures.
This phenomenon is also frequently observed on the Sun and referred as EUV late-phase
(e.g., Woods et al. 2011).

The second case is an explosive eruption in which the coronal mass is released into
the interstellar space and leads to EUV coronal dimmings. In this case, the input (cid:104)|f B|(cid:105)
is 5 times higher than the solar case. And the initial CME ﬂux rope energy is about
1033 ergs. The resulting CME speed is ∼3000 km s−1, which is only slightly higher

than the fast solar CMEs due to the stronger coronal ﬁeld conﬁnement. We simulate
the coronal dynamical evolution for 4 hours after the CME eruption and synthesize
the EUV line emissions. To further investigate the detectability of the dimming signals,
we apply the instrument performance estimates from the Extreme-ultraviolet Stellar
Characterization for Atmospheric Physics and Evolution (ESCAPE) mission concept,
which provides extreme- and far-ultraviolet spectroscopy (70 - 1800 ˚A) to characterize
the high energy radiation environment in the habitable zones around nearby stars (France
et al. 2019). The EUV detector of the ESCAPE mission will be ∼100 times more sensitive
than the previous EUVE mission (Craig et al. 1997). Figure 4 shows the simulated Fe XV
284 ˚A and Fe XVI 335 ˚A line emissions by assuming the star at 6 pc and using 30 minutes
exposure time. The ISM absorption eﬀect has been taken into account assuming N (H
I) = 1018 cm−2 (France et al. 2018). This preliminary result suggests that with better
instrumentation, the stellar coronal dimmings associated with CMEs can be observed.

We summarize the main results as follows:
• The coronal dimmings encode important information about CME energetics, CME-

driven shock properties, and magnetic conﬁguration of erupting ﬂux ropes.

• With higher magnetic ﬂux density, the stellar dimming occurs in the higher tem-
perature range than the solar case. With better instrumentation, the coronal dimming
could be detected from the distant stars.

• Our results show a proof-of-concept that the MHD model can be used for quanti-
tative studies of CME-dimming relationships and applied to stellar cases. To get useful
CME information from the future stellar observations, more detailed modeling studies
are needed.

Discussion
Christoffer Karoff: How would this look if you looked in the optical and not the
UV?

Meng Jin: Because the mass loss of the CME is mainly from the corona, the coronal
dimming is not seen in the optical bands that dominate by photospheric emissions.
