We study the Andreev reﬂections (ARs) at the interface of the type-II Weyl semimetal-
superconductor junctions and ﬁnd double ARs when the superconductor is put in the Weyl semimetal
band tilting direction, which is similar to the double reﬂections of light in anisotropic crystals. The
directions of the double (retro and specular) ARs are symmetric about the normal due to the hy-
perboloidal Fermi surface near the Weyl nodes, but with diﬀerent AR amplitudes depending on the
direction and energy of the incident electron. When the normal direction of the Weyl semimetal-
superconductor interface is changed from parallel to perpendicular with the tilt direction, the double
ARs gradually evolve from one retro-AR and one specular AR, passing through double retro-ARs,
one specular AR and one retro-AR, into one retro AR and one normal reﬂection, resulting in an
anisotropic conductance which can be observed in experiments.

In condensed matter physics, massless Dirac fermions
or chiral Weyl fermions exist as low-energy excitations
and exhibit many novel phenomena in quantum transport
[1–6], triggering much interest in exploring new quasi-
particles in real quantum systems [7–9]. Materials host-
ing Weyl fermions are called Weyl semimetals (WSMs),
where the crossing points of the conduction and valence
bands are known as the “Weyl nodes” with conic-like
spectrums around them. The Weyl node acts like a
topological charge in momentum space with the charge
sign corresponding to its charity. WSMs with point-like
Fermi surface are referred as the conventional or type-I
WSMs. But recent progresses show that the conic spec-
trum can be tilted or overtilted to transform the WSM
into the type-II one [10], where the Fermi surface near
the Weyl nodes is hyperboloidal with a large density of
states. The dramatic spectrum tilt violates the Lorentz-
invariance and generates electron and hole pockets near
the Weyl nodes, resulting in some distinct phenomena,
e.g. the magnetic breakdown, ﬁeld-selective anomalous
optical conductivity and anomalous Hall eﬀect [11–16].
Experimentally LaAlGe, WTe2, and MoTe2 have been
conﬁrmed as the type-II WSMs by observing the topo-
logical Fermi arcs between electron and hole pockets us-
ing angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES)
[17–22].

In this Letter, we investigate the type-II WSM-
superconductor junctions and ﬁnd a new phenomena,
double Andreev reﬂections (ARs), at the interface caused
by the spectrum tilt. In the conductor-superconductor
interface, except for the normal electron reﬂection, there
also exists AR [23], a process where the electron is re-
ﬂected back as a hole in the conductor and a Cooper-
pair is injected into the superconductor. At the small
bias, the conductance of the conductor-superconductor
junction is mainly determined by the AR [24]. ARs can
be classiﬁed into retro-AR and specular AR according
to the directions of the reﬂected holes. Retro-AR oc-
curs in the normal metal-superconductor interface where
the hole almost retraces the path of the incident electron

[Fig.1(a)] and the electron-hole conversion is intraband,
i.e. both electron and hole locate in the same conduction
or valence band. In the graphene-superconductor junc-
tions, the electron and reﬂected hole can locate in diﬀer-
ent bands, of which the interband conversion results in
the specular AR [Fig.1(b)] [25]. In both cases only single
AR (retro or specular AR) occurs at the interface, and
the normal reﬂection exists usually. However, in type-II
WSM-superconductor junctions, the spectrum tilt makes
the conduction and valence bands lie in the same Fermi
level, so both intraband and interband electron-hole con-
versions happen if the superconductor is in the tilt di-
rection (+x direction), leading to the double ARs (retro
and specular ARs) for one incident electron [Fig.1(c)].
The band tilt also forbids the normal reﬂection, result-
ing in a conductance plateau when the bias is within
the superconductor gap. When the interface orientation
of the WSM-superconductor junction is changed from
+x direction to +y direction, the double ARs gradually
evolve into one retro-AR and one normal reﬂection with
a decreasing subgap conductance, indicating the ARs or
conductance through type-II WSM-superconductor junc-
tions are anisotropic. We impose the anisotropic conduc-
tance as a useful detection for the tilting direction of the
Weyl cones.

Consider a two-band eﬀective Hamiltonian near the
Weyl node K 0 which respects the time-reversal symme-
try but breaks inversion symmetry:

H+(k) = ¯hv1kxσ0 + ¯hv2k ·σ,

(1)

where the wave vector k is the displacement from the
Weyl node K 0, σ0 is the identity matrix, σ is the Pauli
matrix vector, and v2 is the Fermi velocity with its sign
determining the charity of the node. The spectrum tilt is
described by the parameter v1. Here we set v1, v2 to be
positive, and v1 > v2 to make the WSM being the type-II
one. Time reversal symmetry requires another Weyl node
locating at −K 0 with its eﬀective Hamiltonian satisfying
[26]:

H−(k) = −¯hv1kxσ0 − ¯hv2(kxσx − kyσy + kzσz).

regions, respectively. By solving the eigenvalues of HBdG,
we obtain the energy dispersions for electron and hole
excitations in the type-II WSM:

Ee±(k) = ¯hv1kx ± ¯hv2|k| − µ,
Eh±(k) = −¯hv1kx ± ¯hv2|k| + µ,

and the excitation energy in the superconductor:

Es(k) = (cid:112)∆2 + (¯hv1kx ± ¯hv2|k| − U )2.

with |k| =
z. Denote Ee+ (Eh−) as the
conduction band for electron (hole), and Ee− (Eh+) for
the valence band. The band tilt makes the slopes in the
+x direction of the bands for electrons (holes) all posi-
tive (negative), so there are two incident modes for elec-
trons and two reﬂected modes for holes. Here we consider
the electron incident from the valence band (Ee−). The
holes are then reﬂected into the conduction band (Eh−)
and the valence band (Eh+). The intraband electron-hole
conversion results in the retro-AR (A1) and the interband
conversion is for the specular AR (A2) [see Fig.1(c-d)].
So at the WSM-superconductor interface, a beam of in-
cident electron is Andreev reﬂected into two beams of
holes, which is similar to the double reﬂections of light
in anisotropic crystals [28, 29].
In the momentum space,

the equienergy surfaces
(Fermi surfaces) for electrons and holes are circular hy-
perboloids satisfying the equation (kx−kxc±)2

and ‘+’ for electrons, ‘-’ for holes. During the reﬂection
process, the energy E, the wave-vectors ky and kz keep
invariant. Since the equienergy surface has rotational
symmetry along the kx-axis, for simplicity we set kz = 0
in the following analysis. Then in the kx − ky plane, the
equienergy lines become hyperbolas as shown in Fig.1(d).
Given E and ky, the intersections A, B, C, D denote the
modes for the incident electron and the reﬂected holes
with their semiclassical velocity (vx, vy) ≡ ∇k E(k )/¯h
[E(k ) is the energy dispersion for electrons or holes] being
perpendicular with the equienergy lines. The black arrow
at point A denotes the direction for the incident electron
with an incident angle α (α = − arctan vy/vx), and the
arrows at C and D are the directions for retro-AR (A1)
and specular AR (A2). Eh+ and Eh− is symmetric about
kx = kxc−, so A1 and A2 have opposite reﬂection angles.
With the increasing of |ky|, |α| increases but saturates at
a critical angle αc = arctan(v2/(cid:112)v2

WSM-SC interface. The solid black arrows indicate the direc-
tions of the incident (reﬂected) electrons and the dashed red
arrows indicate the directions for the reﬂected holes. (d) Hy-
perbolic equienergy lines (Ee±, Eh±) for electrons and holes in

arrows at A and B denote the directions of the incident elec-
tron, and the arrows at C and D are the directions for the
double ARs. α is the incident angle.

By substituting k with p/¯h = −i∇r , we get the eﬀective
Hamiltonian for Weyl nodes at K 0 and −K 0 in the real
space: H+(p/¯h) and H−(p/¯h).

We consider the BCS pairing in the superconductor.
Electron excitations near K 0 are coupled by hole exci-
tations near −K 0, so the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)
Hamiltonian reads [27]:

HBdG =

(cid:18) H+(p/¯h) − µ(r )
∆∗(r)

∆(r )

−H ∗

−(p/¯h) + µ(r )

(cid:19)

, (3)

where µ(r ), ∆(r ) are the chemical potential and the pair-
ing potential. One can verify that H ∗
−(p/¯h) = H+(p/¯h)
because of the time reversal symmetry. The chemical
potential µ(r ) and the pairing potential ∆(r ) are step
functions:

µ(r ) =

(cid:26) µ x < −y tan θ
U x > −y tan θ,

∆(r ) =

(cid:26) 0

x < −y tan θ
∆ x > −y tan θ.

In the WSM region (x < −y tan θ), the chemical poten-
tial µ is tuned by a gate voltage and the superconductor
gap is zero. On the other side, it is the superconducting
region (x > −y tan θ) with a nonzero superconductor gap
∆ and a large chemical potential U (U (cid:29) µ, ∆). Here
θ is the intersection angle of the normal of the WSM-
superconductor interface with the x-bias.

First, let us consider the case of θ = 0. In this case,
the WSM and superconductor are in x < 0 and x > 0

specular AR happen [see Fig.2(b)]. When E = 0, i.e. at
the zero-energy incidence, we ﬁnd A1 = 1 and A2 = 0.
As E increases, A2 goes up and A1 falls down, and they
both get a sharp decline when E > ∆. The total AR co-
eﬃcient A shows the same variation behaviors in Fig.2(a)
and (b) because A only depends on E and ∆. In Fig.2(c)
and (d) we change the chemical potential µ and the tilt
parameter v1 to see how A1 varies. As µ increases, A1
gets higher and approaches A1 = T A(E) in the large µ
limit. A1 also shows the similar asymptotic behavior in
the large tilting limit [see v1 = 30 in Fig.2(d)]. How-
ever, when the tilt is very small (see v1 = 1.01), we ﬁnd
A1 (cid:39) Θ(µ − E), which is similar to the normal incident
case.

√

The incident energy E and angle α dependence of the
AR coeﬃcients A1 and A2 is investigated exhaustively in
2, then α has an up
Fig.3. The tilt v1 is chosen to be
limit αc = 45◦ from the analysis of Fig.1(d). Below the
chemical potential (E < µ), A1 ﬁrst gets down and then
goes up to T A with the increasing of α [Fig.3(a)]. While
A1 just increases monotonically with α when E > µ. For
the ultimate angle incidence (α = αc), A1 = T A and
A2 = 0, so only the retro-AR happens. The specular AR
A2 shows the opposite behavior as A1 due to the relation
A1 + A2 = T A. Note that for appropriate E and α,
the retro-AR and specular AR happen with nearly equal
probabilities (see the green regions in Fig.3). Another
interesting thing we ﬁnd is that for µ = 0, A1 and A2 are
independent of E when E < ∆ [Fig.3(c,d)], which means
once the incident angle α is given, the AR coeﬃcients are
determined.

Next we consider the nonzero orientation angle θ of
the WSM-superconductor interface and will show that
the double ARs are anisotropic, strongly depending on
θ. By performing the coordinate transformation:

the Hamiltonian of the WSM becomes:

H+ = v1σ0(˜px cos θ − ˜py sin θ) + v2σx(˜px cos θ − ˜py sin θ)
(10)

+v2σy(˜px sin θ + ˜py cos θ),

where ˜px = −i¯h∂˜x, ˜py = −i¯h∂˜y. The energy dispersion
is:

Ee±(˜k ) = ¯hv1(˜kx cos θ − ˜ky sin θ) ± ¯hv2|˜k | − µ,

where |˜k | =
y. In the new coordinate system,
the WSM and superconductor are respectively in ˜x < 0
and ˜x > 0 regions, but the band tilts in both ˜x and ˜y
directions. Since E and ˜ky are conserved upon reﬂection
at the interface ˜x = 0, by performing the same calcula-
tion we obtain the directions and the amplitudes of the
double ARs [30]. Fig.4(a) is the schematic diagram of

FIG. 2: (Color online) AR coeﬃcients A1, A2 and A as func-
tions of the incident energy E. The parameters are:

with β = arccos E/∆ if E < ∆, β = −i arcoshE/∆ if
E > ∆. Note the specular-AR (retro-AR) coeﬃcient has
the same amplitudes for the electron incident from the
valence band Ee− and conduction band Ee+ [30]. For
the normal incidence (α = 0), the results reduce into

A1(E) = Θ(µ − E)T A(E), A2(E) = Θ(E − µ)T A(E),(8)

where Θ is the Heaviside step function and T A(E) = 1
√
if E < ∆, T A(E) = (E −
E2 − ∆2)2/∆2 if E > ∆,
so only one AR happens at the normal incidence and
A1, A2 exchange at the chemical potential µ. While for
a general incidence case with α (cid:54)= 0, both A1 and A2
are nonzero. Importantly, the total AR coeﬃcient A ≡
A1 + A2 = T A(E), which only depends on the energy
E and the gap ∆, with nothing to do with the incident
angle α and other parameters. Within the gap (E < ∆),
A = 1, which means the electron-hole conversion at the
interface happens with unit probability. This is because
no modes for the normal electron reﬂection exist, and the
normal tunneling from the WSM to the superconductor
is also prohibited when E < ∆.

In the following numerical calculations, we set ¯h = 1,
v2 = 1, ∆ = 1 and kz = 0. Fig.2(a) shows AR coeﬃ-
cients A1, A2 and A versus E at the normal incidence
(α = 0). The results coincide with Eq.(8) and from the
band structure point of view, the modes symmetry for
electron and hole plays an important role [30]. However,
for the oblique incidence case (α (cid:54)= 0), both retro-AR and

0.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.51.01.50.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.51.01.52.00.00.20.40.60.81.0 A1 A2 A A1, A2 and A(a)(b)  A1 A2 A (c) A1E     (d)E 1=1.01 1=1.5 1=2 1=5 1=10 1=304

and a specular AR again. Note that now A2 is retro-
AR and A1 is specular AR. Further increasing θ, αA2
goes up straightly to 90◦, then the AR A2 disappears
at the critical angle θc = arccos v2/v1 and the normal
electron reﬂection arises with its reﬂection angle αN R =
−90◦. At the critical angle θc, the double ARs evolve
into one specular AR and one normal reﬂection (NR) due
to the band tilt in ˜x direction changing from the type-
II (v1 cos θ > v2) into the type-I (v1 cos θ < v2). Note
that although the WSM still belongs to the type-II one,
only the tilt along the normal direction (˜x-axis) plays a
decisive role in generating the double ARs. With the
further increasing of θ from θ = θc, both αA1 and αN R
go up. Finally when θ = 90◦, αN R increases to −30◦
and A1 turns back to the retro-AR but with smaller AR
angle αA1 than α, which is similar with the normal metal-
superconductor junction. Fig.4(c) shows the amplitudes
for A1, A2 and the NR. One can see that both A1 and A2
have large value with A = A1 + A2 = 1 at θ < θc. A1 = 1
and A2 = 0 at the critical angle θc. Further increasing θ,
A2 disappears and the NR arises with its coeﬃcient RN
increasing with θ except for θ near 90◦. All the analysis
above shows the spatial anisotropy of the double ARs.

(cid:82) d˜ky

The diﬀerential conductance of the type-II WSM-
superconductor junction can be obtained from the
(cid:82) dkz[1 +
BTK formula [31]: G(eV ) = 2e2S
π2h
A(˜ky, kz, eV ) − RN (˜ky, kz, eV )], with the cross-sectional
area of the junction S. Here the spin and valley degenera-
cies [32] are already considered. While the interface angle
θ < θc, G(eV ) can reduce into 2e2 ˜q2S
πh [1 + T A(eV )], where
˜q is the cut-oﬀ value of the integral area (i.e. ˜k2
z ≤
˜q2). Within the superconductor gap T A(eV ) = 1 and we
ﬁnd G(eV ) = 4e2 ˜q2S
πh , which shows a plateau with respect
to the bias V and may be experimentally observed. On
the other hand, when θ > θc, the conductance decreases
and the plateau is broken, because the NR arises and the
total AR coeﬃcient A < 1 [Fig.4(c)] and depends on eV ,
indicating the conductance through the type-II WSM-
superconductor junction is strongly anisotropic. This can
be used to detect the tilt direction of the Weyl cones in
real experiments.

The corresponding reﬂection angles αA1 and αA2 are
shown in Fig.4(b). When θ = 0, the retro-AR A1 has
the same angle as the incident angle (αA1 = 30◦), and
the specular AR A2 is symmetric with A1 with αA2 =
−30◦. With the increasing of θ, αA1 decreases and αA2
increases. At θ ≈ 2◦, αA2 becomes positive, indicating
A2 jumps into the other side of the normal and becomes
the retro-AR. Now double retro-ARs occur with both αA1
and αA2 being positive while 2◦ <
∼ 5◦. At θ ≈ 5◦,
αA1 drops from positive to negative, leading a retro-AR

∼ θ <

In conclusion, we ﬁnd the double ARs in the type-
II WSM-superconductor junction. The band tilt of
the type-II WSM makes both interband and intraband
electron-hole conversions happen at the interface, result-
ing in the specular AR and retro-AR for one incident
electron. The diﬀerential conductance through the junc-
tion is also considered, which exhibits strongly spatial
anisotropy when varying the WSM-superconductor in-
terface orientation.

I. Detailed derivation of Andreev reﬂection coeﬃcients A1 and A2 while the WSM-superconductor interface
orientation angle θ = 0.

While the WSM-superconductor interface orientation angle θ = 0, the WSM is in the x < 0 region and the
superconductor is in the x > 0 region. To calculate the Andreev reﬂection coeﬃcients A1 and A2, we ﬁrst solve the
BdG equation in the type-II WSM side (x < 0):

x+ and k(cid:48)

In fact, here kx−, kx+, k(cid:48)
x− are the kx coordinates of the point A, B, C and D in Fig. 5 [or in Fig.1(d) in the
main text], respectively. The wave-functions Ψe+ and Ψe− are the eigenstates for electrons in the tilted conduction
band Ee+ and valence band Ee−. Ψh+ and Ψh− are the eigenstates for holes in the tilted valence band Eh+ and
conduction band Eh− (see Fig. 5). Both Ψe+ and Ψe− move in the +x direction, so there are two incident modes for
electrons with given energy E and wave vector ky, kz. The Andreev reﬂection is denoted as A1 (A2) if the holes are
reﬂected in the mode Ψh+ (Ψh−).

We ﬁrst consider Ψe− as the incident mode. The wave functions Ψ(r) in the WSM region (the x < 0 region) can

be written as follows:

Ψ(r) = Ψe−(r) + r1Ψh+(r) + r2Ψh−(r),

(15)

FIG. 5: Dispersion relations for electrons and holes in the type-II WSM. Ee+ (Eh−) denotes the tilted conduction band for
electrons (holes), and Ee− (Eh+) is the tilted valence band for electrons (holes). The intersections of the black dashed line
with the bands denote the incident modes Ψe± for electrons and the reﬂected modes Ψh± for holes.

where r1 and r2 are the reﬂection amplitudes to be determined by matching the boundary conditions.

The superconductor is put in the x > 0 region with its BdG equation:

The eigenstates ΨS±(r) are the superpositions of electron and hole excitations in the superconductor, which have
similar forms as the solutions in the graphene-superconductor junction.[1] When E > ∆ these states propagate in the
+x direction, carrying net electron or hole current.[2] When |E| < ∆, ΨS±(r) both decay exponentially as x → +∞,
and the net particle current is zero, so the normal tunneling from the WSM to superconductor is prohibited. In this
case the electron incident from the WSM can only be normally reﬂected as an electron or Andreev reﬂected as a hole.
Since no modes exist for the normal electron reﬂection in the Type-II WSM, the Andreev reﬂection happens with
unit probability.

After obtaining the modes ΨS±(r), the wave functions in the superconductor region (the x > 0 region) can be

described as:

Ψ(r) = aΨS+(r) + bΨS−(r),

where a and b are constants to be determined by matching the boundary conditions.

The matching condition of the wave-functions at x = 0 interface of the WSM-superconductor junction is

Ψ(r)|x=0− = Ψ(r)|x=0+. This means:

[Ψe−(r) + r1Ψh+(r) + r2Ψh−(r)]|x=0− = [aΨS+(r) + bΨS−(r)]|x=0+ .

This is Eq.(7) in the main text. In addition, one can easily verify that when ky = kz = 0 (normal incidence), A1 and
A2 reduce into:

A1(E) = Θ(µ − E)|e−iβ|2,
A2(E) = Θ(E − µ)|e−iβ|2.

(24)

From the band structure point of view, the modes symmetry for electrons and holes plays an important role for
Eq.(24). Fig. 6 is the dispersion relation for the normal incidence (ky = kz = 0). One can see that the reﬂected
holes only locate in the modes symmetric with the incident modes of the electrons about kx = kx0. When E < µ,
the reﬂected hole locates in the valence band of which the intra-band electron-hole conversion results in the retro-AR

FIG. 7: Andreev reﬂection coeﬃcients A1e+, A2e+ and Ae+ = A1e+ + A2e+ as functions of the incident energy E for the
conduction band Ee+ incidence. The parameters are µ = 0.5, v1 = 2, ky = 0 in (a), and µ = 0.5, v1 = 2, ky = 0.2 in (b). One
can see that A1e+ and A2e+ have the same values as A2 and A1 in the Ee− incidence [see Fig.2(a) and (b) in the main text].

(A1). When E > µ the symmetric reﬂection modes lie in the conduction band, so A1 disappears and A2 arises due
to the inter-band electron-hole conversion. In addition, due to the normal incidence with the incident angle α = 0,
both the angle αA1 of the intra-band Andreev reﬂection and the angle αA2 of the inter-band Andreev reﬂection are
zero also.

Up to now we have only considered the incident electron from the valence band Ee−. Similarly, the Andreev
reﬂection coeﬃcients A1e+ and A2e+ for the incident electron from the condcution band Ee+ can be calculated also
[Here A1e+ and A2e+ are the coeﬃcients for holes reﬂected into the valence band Eh+ and the conduction band Eh−,
respectively]:

The results for the conduction band Ee+ incidence are shown in Fig. 7. One can see that A1e+ and A2e+ have the same
values as A2 and A1 in the valence band Ee− incidence by comparison with Fig. 2(a) and (b) in the main text, due
to the unitarity of the scattering matrix. For the conduction band Ee+ incidence, the incident direction is symmetric
with that of Ee− about the normal [see Fig. 1(d) in the main text], so A1e+ becomes specular Andreev reﬂection and
A2e+ becomes the retro-Andreev reﬂection. Therefore, for given energy E and wavevector ky and kz, no matter which
incident mode the electron locates in, the coeﬃcient of the specular Andreev reﬂection (the retro-Andreev reﬂection)
has the same values.

II. Detailed derivation of Andreev reﬂection coeﬃcients A1 and A2 while the WSM-superconductor interface
orientation angle θ (cid:54)= 0.

In this section, we consider the case of the nonzero orientation angle (θ (cid:54)= 0) of the WSM-superconductor interface.
We consider that the normal of the WSM-superconductor interface is still in the x-y plane, but it has an intersection
angle θ with the x−axis [see Fig. 4(a) in the main text]. If the normal of the WSM-superconductor interface is not in
the x-y plane, one can do a rotation transformation around the x-axis to make the normal in the x-y plane, because
that the Hamiltonian of the WSM in Eqs.(1) and (2) in the main text has the symmetry around the x-axis. For a ﬁnite
orientation angle θ, the WSM is in the x < −y tan θ region and the superconductor is in the x > −y tan θ region. In
this case, the incident angle α lies in the range [max(−π/2, θ − αc), min(π/2, θ + αc)] with αc = arctan(v2/(cid:112)v2
2).

θ = π/2.

We ﬁrst take a coordinate transformation:

˜y

(cid:18) cos θ

sin θ
− sin θ cos θ

(cid:19) (cid:18) x

(cid:19)

.

=

After the coordinate transformation, the BdG Hamiltonian becomes (for simplicity we set pz = 0):

˜HBdG =

(cid:18) H+(˜p) − µ(˜x)
∆∗(˜x)

∆(˜x)
−H+(˜p) + µ(˜x)

(cid:19)

,

where H+(˜p) is:

(27)

(28)

H+ = v1σ0(˜px cos θ − ˜py sin θ) + v2σx(˜px cos θ − ˜py sin θ) + v2σy(˜px sin θ + ˜py cos θ),

(29)

where ˜px = −i¯h∂˜x, ˜py = −i¯h∂˜y. µ(˜x) and ∆(˜x) in Eq.(28) are:

µ(˜x) =

(cid:26) µ
U

˜x < 0
˜x > 0,

∆(˜x) =

(cid:26) 0

˜x < 0
∆ ˜x > 0.

(30)

In the new coordinate, the WSM is in the ˜x < 0 region and the superconductor is in the ˜x > 0 region.

Note that there are two cases need to be considered. The ﬁrst one is v1 cos θ > v2, where the slopes in the
+˜x direction of the tilted bands for the incident electrons (reﬂected holes) are all positive (negative), and there
exists double Andreev reﬂections at the interface. The second case is v1 cos θ < v2, where the band tilt in the +˜x
direction is not so violent that only one reﬂected mode exists for holes. In this case, an Andreev reﬂection and a
normal reﬂection happen at the WSM-superconductor interface, which is similar to the normal metal-superconductor
junction or graphene-superconductor junction.

Next considering an electron incidence from the WSM side to the WSM-superconductor interface with the incident
angle α and the incident energy E, and choosing the valence band (Ee−) incidence, the modes for incident and
reﬂected electrons (holes) in the WSM region (˜x < 0) can be given as follows:

In Eq.(31), ˜Ψe− is the incident mode for electron. The reﬂected mode ˜Ψh+ for hole always exists regardless of the
angle θ, but the other reﬂected mode ˜Ψh− for hole keeps only when v1 cos θ > v2. If v1 cos θ < v2 the normal reﬂection
mode ˜Ψr arises, replacing the reﬂected hole ˜Ψh−. Therefore, the wave functions Ψ(r) in the WSM region (the ˜x < 0
region) can be written as follows:

Ψ(r) =

(cid:26) ˜Ψe− + r1 ˜Ψh+ + r2 ˜Ψh−
˜Ψe− + r1 ˜Ψh+ + rN R ˜Ψr

if v1 cos θ > v2,
if v1 cos θ < v2.

Here r1, r2 and rN R are the amplitudes of the Andreev reﬂection A1, the Andreev reﬂection A2 and the normal
reﬂection, respectively.

After obtaining the outgoing modes, the wave functions Ψ(r) in the superconductor region (the ˜x > 0 region) is:

Ψ(r) = a ˜ΨS+ + b ˜ΨS−,

The matching condition at the interface ˜x = 0 of the WSM-superconductor junction is Ψ(r)|˜x=0− = Ψ(r)|˜x=0+. For

the v1 cos θ > v2 case, we have:
