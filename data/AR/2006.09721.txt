We report results from searches for new physics with low-energy electronic recoil data recorded

background rate of 76 ± 2 stat events/(tonne × year × keV) between 1–30 keV, the data enables one
of the most sensitive searches for solar axions, an enhanced neutrino magnetic moment using solar
neutrinos, and bosonic dark matter. An excess over known backgrounds is observed at low ener-
gies and most prominent between 2–3 keV. The solar axion model has a 3.4 σ signiﬁcance, and a
three-dimensional 90% conﬁdence surface is reported for axion couplings to electrons, photons, and
an < 4.8 × 10−18,
nucleons. This surface is inscribed in the cuboid deﬁned by gae < 3.8 × 10−12, gaegeﬀ
and gaegaγ < 7.7 × 10−22 GeV−1, and excludes either gae = 0 or gaegaγ = gaegeﬀ
an = 0. The
neutrino magnetic moment signal is similarly favored over background at 3.2 σ and a conﬁdence
interval of µν ∈ (1.4, 2.9) × 10−11 µB (90% C.L.) is reported. Both results are in strong tension
with stellar constraints. The excess can also be explained by β decays of tritium at 3.2 σ signiﬁ-
cance with a corresponding tritium concentration in xenon of (6.2 ± 2.0) × 10−25 mol/mol. Such
a trace amount can neither be conﬁrmed nor excluded with current knowledge of its production
and reduction mechanisms. The signiﬁcances of the solar axion and neutrino magnetic moment
hypotheses are decreased to 2.0 σ and 0.9 σ, respectively, if an unconstrained tritium component is
included in the ﬁtting. With respect to bosonic dark matter, the excess favors a monoenergetic peak
at (2.3 ± 0.2) keV (68% C.L.) with a 3.0 σ global (4.0 σ local) signiﬁcance over background. This
analysis sets the most restrictive direct constraints to date on pseudoscalar and vector bosonic dark
matter for most masses between 1 and 210 keV/c2. We also consider the possibility that 37Ar may
be present in the detector, yielding a 2.82 keV peak from electron capture. Contrary to tritium, the
37Ar concentration can be tightly constrained and is found to be negligible.

INTRODUCTION

A preponderance of astrophysical and cosmological ev-
idence suggests that most of the matter content in the
Universe is made up of a rarely interacting, non-luminous
component called dark matter [1]. Although several hy-
pothetical dark matter particle candidates have been pro-
posed with an assortment of couplings, masses, and de-
tection signatures, dark matter has thus far eluded direct
detection. The XENON1T experiment [2], employing a
liquid-xenon time projection chamber (LXe TPC), was
primarily designed to detect Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP) dark matter. Due to its unprecedent-
edly low background rate, large target mass, and low
energy threshold, XENON1T is also sensitive to inter-
actions from alternative dark matter candidates and to
other physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Here we
report on searches for (1) axions produced in the Sun,
(2) an enhancement of the neutrino magnetic moment
using solar neutrinos, and (3) pseudoscalar and vector

bosonic dark matter, including axion-like particles and
dark photons.

The XENON1T experiment operated underground at
the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS)
from 2016–2018, utilizing a dual-phase LXe TPC with a
2.0-tonne active target to search for rare processes. A
particle interaction within the detector produces both
prompt scintillation (S1) and delayed electrolumines-
ence (S2) signals. These light signals are detected by
arrays of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) on the top and
bottom of the active volume, and are used to determine
the deposited energy and interaction position of an event.
The latter allows for removing background events near
the edges of the target volume (e.g., from radioactivity
in detector materials) through ﬁducialization. The S2/S1
ratio is used to distinguish electronic recoils (ERs), pro-
duced by, e.g., gamma rays (γs) or beta electrons (βs),
from nuclear recoils (NRs), produced by, e.g., neutrons or
WIMPs, allowing for a degree of particle identiﬁcation.
The ability to determine scatter multiplicity enables fur-
ther reduction of backgrounds, as signals are expected to
have only single energy deposition.

In this paper, we report on searches for ER signals with
data acquired from February 2017 to February 2018, a
time period referred to as Science Run 1 (SR1) [3]. As the
vast majority of background comes from ER events, we
search for excesses above a known background level. The
analysis is carried out in the space of reconstructed en-
ergy, which exploits the anti-correlation of S1 and S2 sig-
nals by combining them into a single energy scale [4], thus
reducing the statistical ﬂuctuations from electron-ion re-
combination [5]. Both S1 and S2 signals are corrected
to disentangle position-dependent eﬀects, such as light
collection eﬃciency (LCE) and electron attachment to

electronegative impurities. After correcting to the mean
LCE across the TPC, S1 is reconstructed using signals
from all PMTs (cS1). For the S2 reconstruction, only
the bottom PMT array is used (cS2b) because it features
a more homogeneous light collection [3]. The full energy
region of interest (ROI) is (1, 210) keV, which is primar-
ily motivated by the search for bosonic dark matter and
discussed further in Sec. III A.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present
the theoretical background and signal modeling of the
beyond-the-SM channels considered in this search. We
describe the data analysis in Sec. III, including the data
selection, background model, and statistical framework.
In Sec. IV, upon observation of a low-energy excess in
the data, we present a hypothesis of a new background
component, tritium, which may be observable for the
ﬁrst time in a xenon detector due to our unprecedented
low background. We then report the results of searches
for solar axions, an anomalous neutrino magnetic mo-
ment, and bosonic dark matter. We end with further
discussion of our ﬁndings and a summary of this work in
Secs. V and VI, respectively. The presence of the excess
motivated further scrutiny of the modeling of dominant
backgrounds, the details of which we present in the Ap-
pendix.

II. SIGNAL MODELS

This section describes the physics channels we search
for in this work. In Sec. II A, we motivate the search of
solar axions, presenting their production mechanisms in
the Sun and the detection mechanism in LXe TPCs, and
summarize two benchmark axion models. In Sec. II B, we
introduce the search for an anomalous neutrino magnetic
moment, which would enhance the neutrino-electron elas-
tic scattering cross section at low energies. In Sec. II C,
we discuss the signals induced by bosonic dark matter
including pseudoscalar and vector bosons, examples of
which are axion-like particles and dark photons, respec-
tively. Expected energy spectra of these signals in the
XENON1T detector are summarized at the end of this
section.

For all signal models presented below, the theoret-
ical energy spectra in a LXe TPC were converted to
the space of reconstructed energy by accounting for de-
tector eﬃciency and resolution, summarized in Fig. 1.
The eﬃciency is shown in Fig. 2 and discussed in
Sec. III A. For the energy resolution, the theoretical spec-
tra were smeared using a Gaussian distribution with
energy-dependent width, which was determined using
an empirical ﬁt of mono-energetic peaks as described
in [2, 4]. The energy resolution σ is given by

√

E + b · E,

(1)

σ(E) = a ·
√

with a = (0.310 ± 0.004)

keV and b = 0.0037 ± 0.0003.
When building a signal model, the resolution is ﬁrst
applied to the deposited, “true” energy spectrum, and

3

then the smeared distribution is corrected according to
the predicted loss due to eﬃciency. This implies that,
near threshold, the mean reconstructed energy is higher
than the true energy, as the reduced eﬃciency at lower
energies shifts the mean of the observed distribution up-
wards. This type of reconstruction bias is fully accounted
for in this analysis.

A. Solar Axions

As a solution to the strong CP problem in quan-
tum chromodynamics (QCD), Peccei and Quinn postu-
lated a mechanism that naturally gives rise to a Nambu-
Goldstone boson, the so-called axion [6–8]. In addition
to solving the strong CP problem, QCD axions are also
well-motivated dark matter candidates, with cosmologi-
cal and astrophysical bounds requiring their mass to be
small (typically (cid:28) keV) [9–13]. On account of this mass
constraint, dark matter axions produced in the early Uni-
verse cannot be observed in XENON1T. However, so-
lar axions would emerge with—and in turn deposit—
energies in the keV range [14–16], the precise energies
to which XENON1T was designed to be most sensi-
tive. An observation of solar axions would be evidence of
beyond-the-SM physics, but would not by itself be suﬃ-
cient to draw conclusions about axionic dark matter.

We consider three production mechanisms that con-
tribute to the total solar axion ﬂux: (1) Atomic recom-
bination and deexcitation, Bremsstrahlung, and Comp-
ton (ABC) interactions [14, 17], (2) a mono-energetic
14.4 keV M1 nuclear transition of 57Fe [15], and (3)
the Primakoﬀ conversion of photons to axions in the
Sun [18, 19]. The ABC ﬂux scales with the axion-electron
coupling gae as

and was taken from [14]. The 57Fe ﬂux scales with an ef-
fective axion-nucleon coupling geﬀ

and interpolated between points using the logarithms of
both photon energies and cross sections. Combining the
production and detection mechanisms, we are able to
(cid:12)
constrain the values of |gae| (ABC), (cid:12)
(cid:12) (57Fe), and
|gaegaγ| (Primakoﬀ)1. We consider these three observ-
ables independently in the analysis, lest we implicitly as-
sume any particular axion model. Still, it is important
to note that these values are indeed related to each other
and to the axion mass under diﬀerent models.

are mostly
model-dependent. We describe here two benchmark
classes of QCD axion models: Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-
Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) [27, 28],
in which axions couple to
electrons at tree level, and Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-
Zhakharov (KSVZ) [29, 30], where couplings to leptons
occur only at loop level. For this reason the ABC
ﬂux is dominant in DFSZ models, while the Primakoﬀ
ﬂux is dominant in KSVZ models. Since the axioelec-
tric cross section scales with the axion-electron coupling,
XENON1T is in general more sensitive to DFSZ-type ax-
ions.

In DFSZ models the axion-electron coupling is given

and Xu and Xd are the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) charges of
the up and down quarks, respectively [20, 31, 32]. The
couplings to quarks take on a similar expression with
respect to βDFSZ. The axion-nucleon couplings g0
an and
g3
an are functions of Xu, Xd, and fa, and can be found
in [31, 33]. For a DFSZ axion, it follows that gae and
geﬀ
an are both non-zero in general, as they are connected

depend on the PQ charges but is directly related to the
axion decay constant (and thus the mass):

the up/down quarks, and E/N represent
model-dependent electromagnetic/color anomalies of the
axial current associated with the axion ﬁeld [34].
It is
typically assumed that E/N = 8/3 in DFSZ models.

In KSVZ models, the PQ charges of the SM quarks
vanish, and there is no βDFSZ-like parameter. The
axion-electron coupling strength,
induced by radiative
corrections, depends on the axial current [31, 35]:

where w = mu/ms, ms is the mass of the strange quark;
Λ is the cutoﬀ of the QCD conﬁnement scale. The
isoscalar/isovector axion-nucleon couplings g0/3
an do not
depend on the PQ charges and are also found in [31, 33].
The axion-photon coupling is given by Eq. (9). For KSVZ
models a benchmark value of E/N = 0 is often used, but
many values are possible [36].

As mentioned above, no particular axion model is as-
sumed in the analysis itself; the three ﬂux components are
considered completely independent of each other. Since,
in principle, it is possible for all three components to
be present at the same time, our solar axion model in-
cludes three unconstrained parameters for the diﬀerent
components. Were a signal observed, the results of the
three-component analysis could then be used to constrain
diﬀerent axion models and possibly infer the axion mass.
This approach also implies that the results hold gen-
erally for solar axion-like particles, which do not have
strict relationships between the couplings, as described
in Sec. II C.

4; the 57Fe component is proportional to

to (gaegaγ)2.

B. Neutrino Magnetic Moment

In the SM, neutrinos are massless, and therefore with-
out a magnetic dipole moment. However, the observation
of neutrino oscillation tells us that neutrinos have mass
and the SM must be extended, thus implying a magnetic

moment of µν ∼ 10−20 µB [37–40], where µB is the Bohr
magneton. Larger values of µν have been considered the-
oretically and experimentally [40–42].
Interestingly, in
addition to providing evidence of beyond-SM physics, the
observation of a µν (cid:38) 10−15 µB would suggest that neu-
trinos are Majorana fermions [40]. Currently the most
stringent direct detection limit is µν < 2.8 × 10−11 µB
from Borexino [42], and indirect constraints based on the
cooling of globular cluster and white dwarfs are an order
of magnitude stronger at ∼ 10−12 µB [32, 43, 44].

An enhanced magnetic moment would increase the
neutrino scattering cross-sections at low energies (on
both electrons and nuclei), and thus could be observable
by low-threshold detectors such as XENON1T. Here we
only consider the enhancement to elastic scattering on
electrons, given by [45]

where Er is the electronic recoil energy and Eν is the
energy of the neutrino. Note that Eq. (11) assumes free
electrons; small corrections need to be made for the elec-
tron binding energies at O(keV) energies.

We search for an anomalous magnetic moment using
solar neutrinos, predominantly those from the proton-
proton (pp) reaction [46]. The expected energy spectrum
for µν = 7 × 10−11 µB is shown in Fig. 1 (right), which
was calculated by folding the expected solar neutrino
ﬂux [46] with Eq. (11) and applying a step-function ap-
proximation to account for the electron binding energies.
In the energy range considered here, this approximation
agrees well with more detailed calculations [47]. Note
that this signal would be added to the SM neutrino elas-
tic scattering spectrum, which we treat as a background
as described in Sec. III B.

C. Bosonic Dark Matter

Axion-like particles (ALPs),

like QCD axions, are
pseudoscalar bosons, but with decay constant and parti-
cle mass (Eq. (6)) decoupled from each other and instead
taken as two independent parameters. This decoupling
allows for ALPs to take on higher masses than QCD ax-
ions; however, it also implies that ALPs do not solve the
strong CP problem.

ALPs are viable dark matter candidates [48], and
could be absorbed in XENON1T via the axioelectric ef-
fect (Eq. (5)) like their QCD counterparts. Assuming
ALPs are non-relativistic and make up all of the lo-
cal dark matter (density ρ ∼ 0.3 GeV/cm3 [49]), the ex-
pected signal is a mono-energetic peak at the rest mass of
the particle, ma, with an event rate given by (see [25, 50])

medium (A ≈ 131 u for xenon). The rate coeﬃcient from
our calculation is consistent with [51] for the dark matter
density used in this work.

In addition to the pseudoscalar ALPs, XENON1T is
also sensitive to vector bosonic dark matter, of which
dark photons are a common example. Dark photons can
couple weakly with SM photons through kinetic mix-
ing [52] and be absorbed with cross section σV given

pseudoscalar above, absorption of a vector boson would
also result in a monoenergetic peak broadened by the
energy resolution of the detector, but with a rate that is
inversely proportional to the particle mass. The expected
spectrum for a 20 keV/c2 ALP with gae = 2 × 10−13 is
shown in Fig. 1 (right). Vector bosons have the same
signature as ALPs, but the rate scales diﬀerently with
mass (see Eqs. (12, 14)).

III. DATA ANALYSIS

This section describes the data-analysis methods em-
ployed to search for the aforementioned signals. The
event-selection criteria and their overall eﬃciency, the
detection eﬃciency, as well as the determination of ﬁdu-
cialization and ROI are given in Sec. III A. Sec. III B
details each component of our background model, the
predictions of which are consistent with the results of a
background-only ﬁt to the data. In Sec. III C, we deﬁne
the likelihood used for the ﬁtting and discuss the statis-
tical framework.

A. Data Selection

The data-selection criteria for this search are similar
to [3], with the selections and eﬃciencies optimized and
reevaluated for the diﬀerent parameter space and ex-
tended energy range. For an event to be considered valid,
an S1-S2 pair is required. A valid S1 demands coinci-
dent signals in at least 3 PMTs, and a 500 photoelectron
(PE) threshold is imposed on the S2 size. This S2 thresh-
old is more stringent than that in [3] in order to reject
background events originating from radon daughters on
the TPC surface [54]. Since signal events are expected
to deposit energy only once in the detector, events with
multiple interaction sites are removed. A variety of se-
lection criteria are applied to ensure data quality and a
correct S1 and S2 pairing, which is detailed in [55]. The
eﬃciencies and uncertainties of the selection criteria are
estimated in a procedure similar to [55], and the cumula-
tive selection eﬃciency is determined using an empirical
ﬁt of the data. The average cumulative selection eﬃ-
ciency over the (1, 210) keV region is (91.2 ± 0.3)%.

The combined eﬃciency of detection and event selec-
tion with uncertainties is shown in Fig. 2. The detec-
tion eﬃciency, dominated by the 3-fold coincidence re-
quirement of S1s, was estimated using both a data-driven
method of sampling PMT hits from S1s in the 20–100 PE

6

range and an independent study based on simulation of
low-energy S1 waveforms [55]. The diﬀerence between
the two methods (∼ 3% average relative diﬀerence in the
drop-oﬀ region) was considered as a systematic uncer-
tainty. This eﬃciency was then converted from S1 to
reconstructed energy using the detector-response model
described in [54], accounting for additional uncertainties
such as the photon yield. The S2 eﬃciency can be as-
sumed to be unity for the energies considered here [55].

FIG. 2. Eﬃciency as a function of energy. The dashed (dot-
ted) line refers to detection (selection) eﬃciency, while the
blue curve and band illustrate the total eﬃciency and the as-
sociated 1-σ uncertainty, respectively. The detection thresh-
old is indicated by the right bound of the gray shaded region.

Events with energies between (1, 210) keV are selected
for this search, with the lower bound determined by re-
quiring the total eﬃciency be larger than 10%, shown in
Fig. 2, and the upper bound limited by an increasing
γ−ray background from detector materials, which is dif-
ﬁcult to model due to large uncertainties on its spectral
shape. While extending the ROI to 210 keV is primarily
motivated by the bosonic dark matter search, all proﬁle
likelihood ﬁts use this full energy range, as it also allows
for better constraints on the background components.
The same 1042 kg cylindrical ﬁducial volume as in [56]
was used to reduce the surface and material backgrounds.
After event selection and strict ﬁducialization, the sur-
face backgrounds, accidental coincidences, and neutrons
make up less than 0.003% of the total events (< 0.3%
below 7 keV), and thus are negligible for this search. Ad-
ditionally, events within 24 hours from the end of calibra-
tion campaigns using injected radioactive sources were re-
moved due to residual source activity. The ﬁnal eﬀective
SR1 live time is 226.9 days and thus the total exposure
is 0.65 tonne-years.

Within the (1, 210) keV ROI and the 1042 kg ﬁducial
volume, ten diﬀerent components were used to model the
background and ﬁt the data, as listed in Tab. I and illus-
trated in Fig. 3.

Six components, numbers i–vi in Tab. I, exhibit con-
tinuous energy spectra and were modeled based on either
theoretical predictions or GEANT4 Monte Carlo simula-
tions, and the rest are mono-energetic peaks that were
modeled as Gaussian functions of known energies and
resolution. The spectrum of each background component
considers the detector energy resolution and eﬃciency
loss in the same way as the signal model construction in
Sec. II. The rates of the background components are con-
strained, when possible, by independent measurements
and extracted by the ﬁt.

The β decay of 214Pb, the dominant continuous back-
is present due to 222Rn emanation into the
ground,
LXe volume by materials. An additional background
comes from intrinsic 85Kr, which is subdominant due
to its removal via cryogenic distillation [57, 58]. The
shape of these spectra, particularly at low energies, can
be aﬀected by atomic screening and exchange eﬀects,
as well as by nuclear structure [59, 60]. The β de-
cays of 214Pb and 85Kr are ﬁrst forbidden non-unique
and ﬁrst forbidden unique transitions, respectively; how-
ever spectra from the IAEA LiveChart (Nuclear Data
Services database) [61] are based on calculations of al-
lowed and forbidden unique transitions, neither of which
includes exchange eﬀects [62]. Likewise, models from
GEANT4 [63] include only the screening eﬀect; however,
its implementation displays a non-physical discontinuity
at low energies [62, 64]. For this work, we performed

7

dedicated theoretical calculations to account for possible
low-energy discrepancies from these eﬀects in 214Pb and
85Kr spectra. These calculations are described in detail
in Appendix A.

The activity of 214Pb can be constrained using in situ
measurements of other nuclei in the same decay chain.
These constraints, described in [54], place a lower bound
of 5.1 ± 0.5 µBq/kg (from coincident 214BiPo) and up-
per bound of 12.6 ± 0.8 µBq/kg (218Po α-decays). For
this analysis, we leave the normalization of the 214Pb
rate unconstrained and use the ﬁt to extract the activ-
ity. The background-only ﬁt results give an event rate
of 63.0 ± 1.3 events/(tonne×year×keV) (abbreviated as
events/(t·y·keV) for the rest of paper) over the ROI af-
ter eﬃciency correction. With the 11% branching ra-
tio (from [65]) and the spectrum of 214Pb decay to the
ground state (calculated in Appendix A), the 214Pb ac-
tivity is evaluated to be (11.1 ± 0.2stats ± 1.1sys) µBq/kg
throughout SR1 and is well within the upper/lower
bounds. The 10% systematic uncertainty is mainly from
the aforementioned branching ratio [65].

The 85Kr decay rate is inferred from dedicated mea-
surements of the isotopic abundance of 85Kr/natKr
(2 × 10−11 mol/mol) and the natKr concentration evo-
lution in LXe [66]. The same measurements also al-
low for the time-dependence of the 85Kr decay rate to
be taken into account. The average rate of 85Kr is
7.4 ± 1.3 events/(t·y·keV) over the ROI in SR1.

An additional background arises from γ emissions
from radioimpurities in detector materials that induce
Compton-scattered electrons; however, this background
is subdominant in the ROI due to the strict ﬁducial vol-
ume selection. The rate from materials is constrained
by radioassay measurements [67] and predicted by simu-
lations [68] to be 2.7 ± 0.3 events/(t·y·keV). This back-
ground is modeled by a ﬁxed, ﬂat component in the ﬁt.
One of the continuous backgrounds considered was
136Xe, a 2νββ emitter intrinsic to xenon. This com-
ponent has an increasing rate as a function of energy
over the ROI. It was constrained in the ﬁt according to
the predicted rate and associated uncertainties on (1) a
136Xe isotopic abundance of (8.49 ± 0.04stat ± 0.13sys)%
as measured by a residual gas analyzer [69], (2) the re-
ported half-life [70], and (3) the calculated theoretical
spectrum [71, 72].

The ﬁrst observation of two-neutrino double electron
capture (2νECEC) of 124Xe was recently reported us-
ing mostly the same SR1 dataset (but diﬀerent selection
cuts) as used in this analysis [73] and is treated as a

branching ratio of 2νECEC, the capture of two K-shell
electrons inducing a peak at 64.3 keV. It is also possible
to capture a K-shell and L-shell electron (36.7 keV) or two
L-shell electrons (9.8 keV) with decreasing probability, as
calculated in [74]. For this analysis, the event selection
and consideration of time dependence allow us to include
all three peaks in the background model. The predicted
rates of the peaks are taken from an updated half-life [75]

8

with ﬁxed branching ratios from [74]; the overall rate was
not constrained in the ﬁt since the half-life was derived
from the same dataset.

Three additional backgrounds were included for
neutron-activated isotopes: 133Xe (β), 131mXe (internal
conversion (IC)), and 125I (electron capture (EC)). These
isotopes were produced during neutron calibrations and
decayed away with half-lives of O(10) days. The IC
decay of 131mXe produces a mono-energetic peak at
164 keV [76], which, along with the other mono-energetic
backgrounds, has the same signature as a bosonic dark
matter signal. It was well-constrained using its half-life
and known dates of neutron calibration. 133Xe decays
to an excited state with a dominant branching ratio and
emits an 81 keV prompt γ upon de-excitation [77], re-
sulting in a continuous spectrum starting at ∼ 75 keV,
given the energy resolution. The rate was also con-
strained in the ﬁt with prediction obtained using time
dependence. The third activated isotope 125I, a daugh-
ter of 125Xe, decays via EC of K-shell, L-shell, and M-
shell with decreasing probability and produces peaks at
67.3 keV, 40.4 keV, and 36.5 keV, respectively [78]. Sim-
ilar to 124Xe 2νECEC, all three peaks of 125I EC are
included in the background model with the ﬁxed branch-
ing ratios from [78]. The 125I contribution was con-
strained using a model based on the time evolution of
125Xe throughout SR1, as detailed in [73].

During SR1, a background from 83mKr (IC) was
83Rb (EC,
present due
T1/2 ∼ 86 days) in the xenon recirculation system, which
presumably was caused by a momentary malfunction of
the source valve and conﬁrmed using half-life measure-
ments. 83mKr decays via a two-step scheme (second step
T1/2 ∼ 154 ns) [79] resulting in many of these events
being removed by the multi-site selections mentioned in
Sec. III A; however, due to the short half-life of the second
step, these decays are often unresolved in time and hence
contribute as a mono-energetic peak at 41.5 keV. This
component was also constrained using a time-evolution
model.

Elastic scattering of solar neutrinos oﬀ electrons is
expected to contribute subdominantly over the entire
ROI. The expected energy spectrum was obtained using
the standard neutrino ﬂux in the Large Mixing Angle
Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (LMA-MSW) model and
cross section given by the SM [46, 80]. Based on rate
calculations of neutrino-electron scattering in xenon as
given in [81], a 3% uncertainty was assigned and used to
constrain the solar neutrino rate in the ﬁt.

We denote the background model described above
as B0. This model was used to ﬁt the SR1 data in
(1, 210) keV by maximizing the likelihood constructed in
Sec. III C. The ﬁt results are consistent with predictions,
as summarized in Tab. I. The best ﬁt of B0 is shown
in Fig. 3, where the top panel is the full SR1 data set
and the bottom two panels are partitions of SR1, which
were ﬁt simultaneously to include the temporal infor-
mation of several backgrounds (see Sec. III C). This ﬁt

In Sec. IV we raise the possibility of an additional
background component, the β decay of tritium, that
we did not include while constructing the background
model. A validated β−decay spectrum from the IAEA
LiveChart [61, 82] was used for the 3H model, as de-
scribed in Appendix A. We treat the possible tritium
contribution separately from B0 for reasons discussed in
Sec. IV A.

tion uncertainties, speciﬁcally for 124Xe (3 peaks), 83mKr,

parameters.

Due to time-dependent backgrounds, the SR1 data
set is divided into two partitions: SR1a consisting of
events within 50 days following the end of neutron cal-
ibrations and SR1b containing the rest, with eﬀective
live times of 55.8 and 171.2 days, respectively. Including
this time information allows for better constraints on the
time-independent backgrounds and improves sensitivity
to bosonic dark matter, especially as the time-dependent
background from 133Xe impacts a large fraction of its

9

search region. The full likelihood is then given by

L = La × Lb,

(16)

where La and Lb are evaluated using Eq. (15) in each
partition. Nuisance parameters that do not change with
time, along with all of the signal parameters, are shared
between the two partitions. The constant nuisance pa-
rameters are:

• the eﬃciency parameter, which is dominated by de-
tection eﬃciency and does not change with time.

• The 214Pb component, which was determined to
have a constant rate in time using detailed studies
of the α-decays of the 222Rn and 218Po as well as
the coincidence signature of 214Bi and 214Po.

• The solar neutrino rate, which would vary by ∼3 %
between the two partitions on account of Earth’s
orbit around the Sun. This is ignored due to the
subdominant contribution from this source.

• The decay rates of the intrinsic xenon isotopes

parameters that maximizes L, while L(µs, ˆˆµb,
maximized L by proﬁling nuisance parameters with a
speciﬁed signal parameter µs. The statistical signiﬁ-
cance of a potential signal is determined by q(0). For
the neutrino magnetic moment and bosonic dark mat-
ter searches, a modiﬁed Feldman-Cousins method in [83]
was adopted in order to derive 90% C.L. bounds with the
right coverage. We report an interval instead of an upper
limit if the global signiﬁcance exceeds 3 σ. For bosonic
dark matter this corresponds to 4 σ local signiﬁcance on
account of the look-elsewhere eﬀect, which is not present
for the neutrino magnetic moment search. The 3 σ signif-
icance threshold only serves as the transition point be-
tween reporting one- and two-sided intervals, and was
decided prior to the analysis to ensure correct coverage.
A two-sided interval does not necessarily indicate a dis-
covery, which in particle physics generally demands a 5σ
signiﬁcance and absence of compelling alternate explana-
tions.

Since the solar axion search is done in the space of
gae, gaegaγ, and gaegeﬀ
an , we extend its statistical analy-
sis to three dimensions. For this search, we use a stan-
dard proﬁle likelihood construction where the true 90th-
percentile of the test statistic (Eq. (17)) was evaluated

The test statistic used for the inference is deﬁned as

at several points on a three-dimensional grid and in-
terpolated between points to deﬁne a 3D ‘critical’ vol-
ume of true 90-percent threshold values. By construc-
tion, the intersection of this volume with the test statis-
tic q(gae, gaegaγ, gaegan) deﬁnes a three-dimensional 90%
C.L. volume in the space of the three axion parameters.
In Sec. IV we report the two-dimensional projections of
this volume, found by proﬁling over the third respective
signal component.

ing to a radial distance from the TPC surface of (cid:38) 11 cm)
along with the stricter S2 threshold cut. Both of these
backgrounds also have well-understood signatures in the
(cS1, cS2b) parameter space that are not observed here,
as shown in Fig. 5.

220Rn calibration events are also shown (density map). All the
distributions are within the one-tonne ﬁducial volume. Gray
lines show isoenergy contours for electronic recoils, where 1
and 7 keV contours, the boundaries of the reference region,
are highlighted in blue.

work described in Sec. III C. This ﬁt suggests that the eﬃ-
ciency shown in Fig. 2 describes well the expected spectrum
from 214Pb, the dominant background at low energies.

FIG. 4. A zoomed-in and re-binned version of Fig. 3 (top),
where the data display an excess over the background model
B0. In the following sections, this excess is interpreted under
solar axion, neutrino magnetic moment, and tritium hypothe-
ses.

When compared to the background model B0, the
data display an excess at low energies, as shown in
Fig. 4. The excess departs slightly from the background
model near 7 keV, rises with decreasing energy with a
peak near 2–3 keV, and then subsides to within ±1 σ of
the background model near 1–2 keV. Within this refer-
ence region of 1–7 keV, there are 285 events observed in
the data compared to an expected 232 ± 15 events from
the background-only ﬁt, a 3.3 σ Poissonian ﬂuctuation.
Events in this energy region are uniformly distributed in
the ﬁducial volume. The temporal distribution of these
events are discussed in Sec. IV E.

Several instrumental backgrounds and systematic ef-
fects were excluded as possible sources of the excess.
Accidental coincidences (AC), an artiﬁcial background
from detector eﬀects, are expected to be spatially uni-
form, but are tightly constrained to have a rate of
< 1 event/(t·y·keV) based on the rates of lone signals
in the detector, i.e., S1s (S2s) that do not have a corre-
sponding S2 (S1) [54]. Surface backgrounds have a strong

using 220Rn calibration data. The β decay of 212Pb, a
daughter of 220Rn, was used to calibrate the ER response
of the detector, and thus allows us to validate the eﬃ-
ciency modeling with a high-statistics data set. Similarly
to 214Pb, the model for 212Pb was calculated to account
for atomic screening and exchange eﬀects, as detailed in
Appendix A. A ﬁt to the 220Rn data with this model and
the eﬃciency parameter described in Sec. III C is shown
in Fig. 6 for a 1-tonne ﬁducial volume, where good agree-
ment is observed (p-value = 0.50). Additionally, the S1
and S2 signals of the low-energy events in background
data were found to be consistent with this 220Rn data
set, as shown in Fig. 5. This discounts threshold eﬀects
and other mismodeling (e.g., energy reconstruction) as
possible causes for the excess observed in Fig. 4.

Uncertainties in the theoretical background models
were considered, particularly for the dominant 214Pb
component. More details can be found in Appendix A,
but we brieﬂy summarize them here. A steep rise in
the spectrum at low energies could potentially be caused
by exchange eﬀects in β-decay emission; however, this
component is accurate to within 1% and therefore neg-
ligible with respect to the observed excess. The remain-
ing two components, namely the endpoint energy and
nuclear structure, tend to shift the entire β distribu-
tion, rather than cause steep changes over a range of
∼ 10 keV. Conservatively, the combined uncertainty from
these two components is +6% in the 1–10 keV region, as
described in the Appendix A. In comparison, a +50% un-
certainty at 2–3 keV on the calculated 214Pb spectrum,
as constrained by the higher energy component, would
be needed to make up the excess.

We also considered backgrounds that might in princi-
ple be present in trace amounts. First, low-energy X-
rays from 127Xe EC, as seen in [84] and [85], are ruled
out for a number of reasons. 127Xe is produced from cos-
mogenic activation at sea level; given the short half-life
of 36.4 days and the fact that the xenon gas was under-
ground for O(years) before the operation of XENON1T,
127Xe would have decayed to a negligible level. Indeed,
high-energy γs that accompany these X-rays were not
observed, and with their O(cm) mean free path in LXe
they could not have left the O(m)-sized TPC undetected.
For these reasons, we conclude that 127Xe was no longer
present during SR1.

Another potential background is 37Ar, which decays
via EC to the ground state of 37Cl, yielding a 2.82 keV
peak with a 0.90 branching ratio [86].
It was consid-
ered by the LUX collaboration as a background to ex-
plain a possible excess rate at ∼ 3 keV in their data [87].
Its ingress was hypothesized to come from either from
an initial amount in the xenon gas or from an air leak
during operations; however, no deﬁnitive conclusion was
drawn based on measurements of both the leakage rate
and the 37Ar concentration in air at the experimental
site [88]. We consider the two aforementioned possibil-
ities for the introduction of 37Ar into the xenon target

11

and place quantitative constraints on each source.

37Ar has a half-life of T1/2 = 35.0 days [86] and a typ-
ical abundance in natAr of ∼ 10−20 mol/mol [89]. Given
an initial measured natAr concentration of <5 ppm in the
xenon inventory [90], 37Ar decayed to a negligible level,
< 1 events/(t·y), by the start of the XENON1T com-
missioning phase (> 400 days). As with krypton, argon
is not removed by the getter in the puriﬁcation system,
although it is removed by online 85Kr distillation (see
Sec. III B). This further suppresses its presence prior to
SR1. These factors conclusively rule out the presence of
37Ar from its initial concentration in the xenon inventory.

With respect to an 37Ar component from a constant
air leak, the similarities between krypton and argon noble
gases allow us to use natKr to constrain the concentration
of 37Ar in the detector. From frequent measurements
using rare gas mass spectrometry (RGMS) [66] and its
natural abundance [91], the observed increasing concen-
tration of natKr of < 1 ppt/year gives an upper limit on
the leak rate of ≤ 0.9 liter/year during SR1, following on-
line distillation [92]. We make a conservative assumption
that the natKr increase is due entirely to a leak (neglect-
ing emanation).

The air inside the experimental hall at LNGS, supplied
from outside of the laboratory and fully exchanged within
2.5 hours, has an 37Ar concentration of < 3.2 mBq/m3,
as determined from measurements taken in July 2020 fol-
lowing the methods in [93, 94]. We set a constraint using
a robust upper limit of 5 mBq/m3 for the 37Ar equi-
librium concentration to account for possible seasonal
variations [95, 96]. The estimate is further reﬁned after
considering the diﬀerential leak rates of the two noble
gases based on their respective viscosities in air, as well
as accounting for the relative volatility of argon in liq-
uid/gaseous xenon. Applying these corrections and con-
servatively assuming that 37Ar reached an equilibrium
activity by the start of SR1, we ﬁnd that its expected rate
is <5.2 events/(t·y). To explain the excess in XENON1T,
the 37Ar rate is required to be ∼ 65 events/(t·y), imply-
ing that the deduced upper limit is a factor of 13 too low
to account for the excess. This conservative constraint
on its presence in SR1 therefore excludes 37Ar from a
constant air leak as an explanation for the excess.

The time dependence of a potential 37Ar background
is discussed further in Sec. IV E; however no clear trend
is observed due to low statistics, and any temporal ﬂuc-
tuations are still constrained by the measured krypton
concentrations throughout SR1. Given its short half-life,
low measured concentration, and strong constraints from
the leak hypothesis, we conclude that 37Ar cannot make
up the excess, although it may be present in the detector
at a negligible level.

We also considered an additional background that has
never been observed before in LXe TPCs: the β emis-

sion of tritium2, which has a Q-value of 18.6 keV and a
half-life of 12.3 years [100]. Tritium may be introduced
from predominantly two sources: cosmogenic activation
of xenon during above-ground exposure [101] and em-
anation of tritiated water (HTO) and hydrogen (HT)
from detector materials due to its cosmogenic and an-
thropogenic abundance. In contrast to 127Xe and 37Ar,
the tritium hypothesis cannot be ruled out. In Sec. IV A
we consider several possible mechanisms for the intro-
duction of tritium into the detector and the uncertainties
involved in its production and reduction processes in an
attempt to estimate its concentration.

A. Tritium Hypothesis

In order to determine the hypothetical concentration of
tritium required to account for the excess, we search for
a 3H ‘signal’ on top of the background model B0. When
compared to B0, the tritium hypothesis is favored at 3.2 σ
and the ﬁtted rate is 159 ± 51 events/(t·y) (68% C.L.),
which would correspond to a 3H/Xe concentration of
(6.2 ± 2.0) × 10−25 mol/mol. As tritium is expected to
be removed by the xenon puriﬁcation system, this con-
centration would correspond to an equilibrium value be-
tween emanation and removal. The spectral ﬁts under
this hypothesis are illustrated in Fig. 7 (a).

Due to its minute possible concentration, long half-life
with respect to our exposure, and the fact that it decays
through a single channel, we are unable to conﬁrm the
presence of tritium from SR1 data directly. We therefore
try to infer its concentration from both initial conditions
and detector performance parameters.

A tritium background component from cosmogenic ac-
tivation of target materials has been observed in sev-
eral dark matter experiments at rates compatible with
predictions [102], although it has never before been de-
tected in xenon. From exposure to cosmic rays during
above-ground storage of xenon, we estimate a conser-
vative upper limit on the initial 3H/Xe concentration
of < 4 × 10−20 mol/mol, based on GEANT4 activation
rates [101] and assuming saturation activity. At this
stage, tritium will predominantly take the form of HTO,
given the measured ppm water impurities in the xenon
gas and equilibrium conditions [90, 103]. Through xenon
gas handling prior to ﬁlling the detector (i.e., conden-
sation of H2O/HTO on the walls of the cooled xenon-
storage vessel) and puriﬁcation via a high-eﬃciency get-
ter with a hydrogen removal unit [2, 104], we expect the
concentration to be reduced to < 10−27 mol/mol, thus

12

reaching negligible levels with respect to the observed
excess.

Tritium may also be introduced as HTO and HT via
their respective atmospheric abundances. Water and
hydrogen, and therefore tritium, may be stored inside
materials, such as the TPC reﬂectors and the stainless
steel of the cryostat. This type of source is expected
to emanate from detector and subsystem materials at
a rate in equilibrium with its removal via getter puriﬁ-
cation. Tritium can be found in water at a concentra-
tion of (5 − 10) × 10−18 atoms of 3H for each atom of
hydrogen in H2O [105–107]. Here we assume the same
abundance of 3H in atmospheric H2 as for water3. Us-
ing the best-ﬁt rate of tritium and the HTO atmospheric
abundance, a combined (H2O + H2) impurity concentra-
tion of (cid:38) 30 ppb in the LXe target would be required to
make up the excess. Since water impurities aﬀect opti-
cal transparency, the high light yield in SR1 indicates an
O(1)-ppb H2O concentration [68, 110], thus implying a
maximum contribution from HTO to the 3H/Xe concen-
tration of ∼ 1 × 10−26 mol/mol. With respect to H2, we
currently have no direct or indirect measurements of its
concentration in the detector. Instead, we consider that
O2-equivalent, electronegative impurities must reach sub-
ppb levels in SR1, given the achieved electron lifetime of
∼ 650 µs (at 81 V/cm) [3, 111]. Thus for tritium to make
up the excess requires a factor ∼ 100 higher H2 concen-
tration than that of electronegative impurities. Under
the above assumptions, tritium from atmospheric abun-
dance appears to be an unlikely explanation for the ex-
cess. However, we do not currently have measurements
of the equilibrium H2 emanation rate in XENON1T, and
thus the HT concentration cannot be suﬃciently quanti-
ﬁed.

In conclusion, possible tritium contributions from cos-
mogenic activation or from HTO in SR1 appear too small
to account for the excess, while it is not possible to in-
fer the concentration of HT. In addition, various fac-
tors contribute further to the uncertainty in estimat-
ing a tritium concentration within a LXe environment,
such as its unknown solubility and diﬀusion properties,
as well as the possibility that it may form molecules other
than HT and HTO. Since the information and measure-
ments necessary to quantify the tritium concentration
are not available, we can neither conﬁrm nor exclude it
as a background component. Therefore, we report re-
sults using the background model B0, and then sum-
marize how our results would change if tritium were in-
cluded as an unconstrained background component. All
reported constraints are placed with the validated back-
ground model B0 (i.e., without tritium).

2 Tritium in the form of tritiated methane has been used for cal-
ibration of LXe TPCs [97–99], including XENON100, but was
not used as a calibration source in XENON1T. Following the
XENON100 tritium calibration, neither the xenon gas nor the
materials that came into contact with the tritiated methane were
used in XENON1T.

3 Although geographical and temporal HT abundances in the
atmosphere vary due to anthropogenic activities, HT that
reaches the Earth’s surface undergoes exchange to HTO within
5 hours [108, 109].

FIG. 7. Fits to the data under various hypotheses. The null and alternative hypotheses in each scenario are denoted by gray
(solid) and red (solid) lines, respectively. For the tritium (a), solar axion (b), and neutrino magnetic moment (c) searches,
the null hypothesis is the background model B0 and the alternative hypothesis is B0 plus the respective signal. Contributions
from selected components in each alternative hypothesis are illustrated by dashed lines. Panel (d) shows the best ﬁts for an
additional statistical test on the solar axion hypothesis, where an unconstrained tritium component is included in both null
and alternative hypotheses. This tritium component contributes signiﬁcantly to the null hypothesis, but its best-ﬁt rate is
negligible in the alternative hypothesis, which is illustrated by the orange dashed line in the same panel.

B. Solar Axion Results

We search for ABC, 57Fe, and Primakoﬀ axions simul-
taneously. Under this signal model, B0 is rejected at
3.4 σ, a value determined using toy Monte Carlo meth-
ods to account for the three parameters of interest in
the alternative hypothesis. A comparison of the best ﬁts
under the alternative hypothesis (B0 + axion) and null
hypothesis (B0) can be found in Fig. 7 (b).

A three-dimensional conﬁdence volume (90% C.L.) was
an . This

calculated in the space of gae vs. gaegaγ vs. gaegeﬀ
volume is inscribed in the cuboid given by

gae < 3.8 × 10−12
an < 4.8 × 10−18

gaegeﬀ
gaegaγ < 7.7 × 10−22 GeV−1.

While easy to visualize, this cuboid is more conservative
(it displays over-coverage) than the three-dimensional
conﬁdence volume it encloses and does not describe
the correlations between the parameters. The correla-

tion information can be found in Fig. 8, which shows
the two-dimensional projections of the surface. For the
ABC–Primakoﬀ and ABC–57Fe projections (Fig. 8 top
and middle, respectively), gae can be easily factored out
of the y-axis to plot gaγ vs gae (top) and geﬀ
an vs gae
(middle). This is not as straightforward for the 57Fe-
Primakoﬀ projection (Fig. 8 bottom). Also shown in
Fig. 8 are constraints from other axion searches [84, 85,
112–116] as well as predicted values from the benchmark
QCD models DFSZ and KSVZ.

Fig. 8 (top) is extracted from the projection onto the
ABC–Primakoﬀ plane. Since the ABC and Primakoﬀ
components are both low-energy signals, the 90% con-
ﬁdence region is anti-correlated in this space and — due
to the presence of the low-energy excess — suggests ei-
ther a non-zero ABC component or non-zero Primakoﬀ
component. Since our result gives no absolute lower
bound on gae, the limit on the product gaegaγ cannot
be converted into a limit on gaγ on its own; i.e., with
gaegaγ=7.6 × 10−22 GeV−1, gaγ → ∞ as gae → 0, as
shown in Fig. 8 (top).

ABC–57Fe plane. Unlike the ABC-Primakoﬀ case, these
two signals are not degenerate; however, they still display
anti-correlated behavior. The reason for this is that the
test statistic q (Eq. (17)) is relatively large with small
gae, meaning small changes in the 57Fe rate about the
best-ﬁt make q cross the 90% threshold value and thus
be excluded by our 90% conﬁdence volume. There is
no statistical signiﬁcance (< 1 σ) for the presence of a
14.4 keV peak from 57Fe axions.

Lastly, Fig. 8 (bottom) shows the projection onto the
Primakoﬀ-57Fe plane, where no correlation is observed.
The Primakoﬀ and 57Fe components are both allowed to
be absent as long as there is a non-zero ABC component.
This means that, of the three axion signals considered,
the ABC component is the most consistent with the ob-
served excess.

The three projections of Fig. 8 can be used to recon-
struct the three-dimensional 90% conﬁdence volume for
gae, gaegaγ, and gaegeﬀ
an . Due to the presence of an ex-
cess at low energy, this volume would suggest either a
non-zero ABC component or a non-zero Primakoﬀ com-
ponent. However, the coupling values needed to explain
this excess are in strong tension with stellar cooling con-
straints [114–118], with the exception of a minute region
in the 3D coupling space which corresponds to small gae
and large geﬀ
an , gaγ. The CAST constraints [112] as shown
are valid for axion masses below 10 meV/c2 while those
from XENON1T and similar experiments hold for all ax-
ion masses up to ∼ 100 eV/c2. For an axion mass be-
low 10 meV/c2, the CAST result prefers the region with
large gae and small gaγ; however, there is no tension be-
tween the CAST result and this result for higher axion
masses (ma > 250 meV/c2) due to the limited sensitivity
of CAST for high-mass axions.

As described above, we cannot exclude tritium as an
explanation for this excess. Thus, we report on an ad-
ditional statistical test, where an unconstrained tritium
component was added to the background model B0 and
proﬁled over alongside the other nuisance parameters. In
this case, the null hypothesis is the background model
plus tritium (B0 + 3H) and the alternative includes the
three axion signal components (B0 + 3H + axion), where
tritium is unconstrained in both cases. The solar axion
signal is still preferred in this test, but its signiﬁcance
is reduced to 2.0σ. The ﬁts for this analysis are shown
in Fig. 7 (d). The tritium component is negligible in the
alternate best-ﬁt, but its presence allows for a better ﬁt
under—and thus a reduced signiﬁcance of rejecting—the
null hypothesis.

C. Neutrino Magnetic Moment Results

When compared to the neutrino magnetic moment sig-
nal model, the background model B0 is rejected at 3.2 σ.
The best-ﬁts of the null (B0) and alternative (B0 + µν)
hypotheses for this search are shown in Fig. 7 (c).

is given by

µν ∈ (1.4, 2.9) × 10−11 µB,

and is shown in Fig. 9 along with the constraints from
other searches. The upper boundary of this interval is
very close to the limit reported by Borexino [42], which
is currently the most stringent direct detection constraint
on the neutrino magnetic moment. Similar to the solar
axion analysis, if we infer the excess as a neutrino mag-
netic moment signal, our result is in strong tension with
indirect constraints from analyses of white dwarfs [119]
and globular clusters [44]. The result is also compatible
with the constraint from XENON1T using the S2-only
method, which is able to probe a lower energy region
and is further discussed in Sec. IV E. It is important to
note that the neutrino ﬂavor does impact the interaction
involving the magnetic moment, which in reality is a 3×3
matrix due to neutrino mixing. Our result, based on a
ﬂavor-insensitive detection of solar neutrinos, is thus di-
rectly comparable to Borexino’s, but not necessarily to
Gemma’s (reactor electron anti-neutrinos) or the astro-
physical limits (electron neutrinos).

As in Sec. IV B, we report on an additional statistical
test where an unconstrained tritium component was in-
cluded in both null and alternative hypotheses. In this
test the signiﬁcance of the neutrino magnetic moment
signal is reduced to 0.9 σ with the presence of a tritium
background.

This is the most sensitive search to date for an en-
hanced neutrino magnetic moment with a dark matter
detector, and suggests that this beyond-the-SM signal
be included in the physics reach of other dark matter
experiments.

D. Bosonic Dark Matter Results

For bosonic dark matter, we iterate over (ﬁxed) masses
between 1 and 210 keV/c2 to search for peak-like ex-
cesses. The trial factors to convert between local and
global signiﬁcance were extracted using toy Monte Carlo
methods. While the excess does lead to looser constraints
than expected at low energies, we ﬁnd no global signiﬁ-
cance over 3 σ for this search under the background model
B0. We thus set an upper limit on the couplings gae and
κ as a function of particle mass.

These upper limits (90% C.L.) are shown in Fig. 10,
along with the sensitivity band in green (1σ) and yel-
low (2σ). The losses of sensitivity at 41.5 keV and
164 keV are due to the 83mKr and 131mXe backgrounds,
respectively, and the gains in sensitivity at around 5
and 35 keV are due to increases in the photoelectric
cross-section in xenon. The ﬂuctuations in our limit
are due to the photoelectric cross-section, the logarith-
mic scaling, and the fact that the energy spectra dif-
fer signiﬁcantly across the range of masses. For most
masses considered, XENON1T sets the most stringent

FIG. 9. Constraints (90% C.L.) on the neutrino magnetic mo-
ment from this work compared to experiments Borexino [42]
and Gemma [120], along with astrophysical limits from the
cooling of globular clusters [44] and white dwarfs [119]. The
constraint from XENON1T using ionization signal only (S2-
only) is also shown (see Sec. IV E). Arrows denote allowed
regions. The upper boundary of the interval from this work
is about the same as that from Borexino and Gemma. If we
interpret the low-energy excess as a neutrino magnetic mo-
ment signal, its 90% conﬁdence interval is in strong tension
with the astrophysical constraints.

direct-detection limits to date on pseudoscalar and vec-
tor bosonic dark matter couplings.

Due to the presence of the excess, we performed an ad-
ditional ﬁt using the bosonic dark matter signal model,
with the particle mass allowed to vary freely between
1.7–3.3 keV/c2. The result gives a favored mass value of
(2.3 ± 0.2) keV/c2 (68% C.L.) with a 3.0 σ global (4.0 σ
local) signiﬁcance over background. A log-likelihood ra-
tio curve as a function of mass is shown in Fig. 11 (left),
along with the asymptotic 1-σ uncertainty and the local
signiﬁcance for each mass. The spectral ﬁt of the 2.3 keV
peak is illustrated in Fig. 11 (right). Since the energy
reconstruction in this region is validated using 37Ar cali-
bration data, whose distribution has a mean value within
< 1% of the expectation at 2.82 keV [86], this analysis
can also be used to compare the data to potential mono-
energetic backgrounds in this region.

E. Additional Checks

Here we describe a number of additional checks to in-
vestigate the low-energy excess in the context of the tri-
tium, solar axion, and neutrino magnetic moment hy-
potheses.

The time dependence of events with energies in
(1, 7) keV in SR1 was investigated and found to be incon-
clusive. The event rate is slightly higher in the beginning
of SR1, but the rate evolution is statistically consistent
with (1) a constant rate, (2) a constant background rate
(B0) plus a subtle ∼ 7 % (peak-to-peak) rate modula-

nent between 2 and 3 keV, where the respective detec-
tion eﬃciencies are ∼ 80% and 94%, changing the analy-
sis threshold has little impact unless set high enough so
as to remove the events in question. This is not well-
motivated, given the high eﬃciency in the region of the
excess. For all thresholds considered (namely, 1.0, 1.6,
2.0, 3.0 keV), the solar axion model gives the best ﬁt to
the data. We hence conclude that our choice of analysis
threshold impacts neither the presence nor interpretation
of the low-energy excess.

We also checked data from Science Run 2 (SR2), an
R&D science run that followed SR1, in an attempt to
understand the observed excess. Many puriﬁcation up-
grades were implemented during SR2, including the re-
placement of the xenon circulation pumps with units that
(1) are more powerful, leading to improved puriﬁcation
speed, and (2) have lower 222Rn emanation, leading to
a reduced 214Pb background rate in the TPC [129, 130],
which is further decreased by online radon distillation.
The resulting increased puriﬁcation speed and reduced
background make SR2 useful to study the tritium hy-
pothesis. If the excess were from tritium (or another non-
noble contaminant), we would expect its rate to decrease
due to the improved puriﬁcation; on the other hand, the
rate of the signal hypotheses would not change with pu-
riﬁcation speed.

While the SR2 puriﬁcation upgrades allowed for an
improved xenon purity and a reduced background level,
the unavoidable interruption of recirculation for the up-
grades also led to less stable detector conditions. Thus,
in addition to a similar event selection process as SR1
in Sec. III A, we removed several periods of SR2 for this
analysis to ensure data quality. Periods where the elec-
tron lifetime changed rapidly due to tests of the puriﬁ-
cation system were removed to reduce uncertainty in the
energy reconstruction. We also removed datasets during
which a 83mKr source was left open for calibration. Data
within 50 days of the end of neutron calibrations were
also removed to reduce neutron-activated backgrounds
and better constrain the background at low energies. Af-
ter the other selections, this data would have only added
∼ 10 days of live time; thus, for simplicity, it was re-
moved rather than ﬁt separately like the SR1 dataset.
With these selections, the eﬀective SR2 live time for this
analysis is 24.4 days, with an average ER background re-
duction of 20% in (1, 30) keV as compared to SR1.

A proﬁle likelihood analysis was then performed on
SR2 with a similar background model as SR1, denoted
as BSR2. Since we are primarily interested in using this
data set to test the tritium hypothesis, we focus on the
tritium results.

Similarly to SR1, we search for a tritium signal
on top of the background model BSR2, and ﬁnd that
the background-only hypothesis is slightly disfavored at
2.3 σ. The SR2 spectrum, along with the ﬁts for the null
(BSR2) and alternative (BSR2 + 3H) hypotheses, can be
found in Fig. 12. A log-likelihood ratio curve for the tri-
tium component is given in Fig. 13, which shows that

tion from the change in Earth-Sun distance, and (3) a
constant background rate (B0) plus an exponentially de-
creasing component with a ﬁxed half-life of 35 days (37Ar
half-life) or 12.3 years (3H half-life). As another test of
time dependence, we split SR1 into three periods with
equal exposure and ﬁt the data in each period with the
ABC solar axion signal model. Similarly to the (1,7) keV
rate evolution, the best-ﬁt signal rate is the highest in the
ﬁrst period of SR1, but is not statistically signiﬁcant as
the signal rate is consistent within uncertainty between
the three periods. We therefore conclude that, due to
limited statistics, at this time we cannot use time de-
pendence to exclude any of the hypotheses discussed in
this work. More detailed time dependence studies will be
presented in a forthcoming publication.

Since the excess events have energies near our 1 keV
threshold, where the eﬃciency is ∼ 10%, we consid-
ered higher analysis thresholds to check the impact of
this choice on the results. With the excess most promi-

the ﬁtted tritium rate is 320 ± 160 events/(t·y), higher
than that from SR1 but consistent within uncertainties.
The rate uncertainty in SR2 is much larger than that
in SR1 due to limited statistics. The solar axion and
magnetic moment hypotheses give similar results, with
signiﬁcances ∼ 2 σ and best-ﬁt values larger than, but
consistent with, the respective SR1 ﬁt results. Thus these
SR2 studies are largely inconclusive.

Lastly, we also checked these hypotheses in a diﬀer-
ent energy region using the so-called ‘S2-only’ approach,
where the requirement for an S1 signal is dropped, al-
lowing for a ∼ 200 eV energy threshold. XENON1T’s S2-
only analysis [123] was used to place limits on the tritium
rate (< 2256 events/(t·y)) and gae (< 4.8×10−12) that are
far greater than, and therefore consistent with, the con-

straints derived here. The S2-only analysis is not as sensi-
tive to the tritium and axion signals because both spectra
peak above 1 keV. On the other hand, many of the pre-
dicted signal events from neutrino magnetic moment fall
below 1 keV as the rate increases with falling energy, so
the S2-only search is more relevant for this hypothesis. It
yields a 90% C.L. one-sided limit of µν < 3.1 × 10−11 µB,
consistent with the upper boundary of the 90% conﬁ-
dence interval obtained in Sec. IV C. Therefore, none of
the discussed hypotheses are in conﬂict with the S2-only
result.

DISCUSSION

We observe an excess of electronic recoil events at low
energies in XENON1T data. In the reference region of
1–7 keV, 285 events are observed whereas 232 ± 15 events
are expected from the background-only ﬁt to the data.
The β decay of tritium is considered as a possible ex-
planation, as it has a similar spectrum to that observed
and is expected to be present in the detector at some
level. We are unable to independently conﬁrm the pres-
ence of tritium at the O(10−25) mol/mol concentration
required to account for the excess, and so treat it sep-
arately from our validated background model.
If elec-
tronic recoils from tritium decay were the source of the
excess, this would be its ﬁrst indication as an atmospheric
source of background in LXe TPCs. The tritium hypoth-
esis clearly represents a possible SM explanation for the
excess, but — based on spectral shape alone — the solar
axion model is the most favored signal by the data at
3.4 σ, albeit at only ∼ 2 σ if one considers tritium as an
additional background.

If this excess were a hint of a solar axion, our result
would suggest either (1) a non-zero rate of ABC axions
or (2) a non-zero rate of both Primakoﬀ and 57Fe axions.
If we interpret the excess as an ABC axion signal (i.e.,
take gaγ and geﬀ
an to be zero), the required value of gae
is smaller than that ruled out by other direct searches
but has a clear discrepancy with constraints from indi-
rect searches [44, 131]. These constraints are a factor of
∼ 5–10 lower than reported here, although subject to sys-
tematic uncertainties. It is noteworthy that some of these
astrophysical analyses, while their constraints are still
stronger than direct searches, do in fact suggest an addi-
tional source of cooling compatible with axions [117, 131].
If the indirect hints and the XENON1T excess were in-
deed explained by axions, the tension in gae could be
relieved by underestimated systematic uncertainties in,
e.g., stellar evolution theory [44] or white dwarf luminos-
ity functions [132], or by a larger solar axion ﬂux than
that given in [14].

Although not considered in this work, XENON1T is
also directly sensitive to the axion-photon coupling via
the inverse Primakoﬀ eﬀect, whereby a solar axion coher-
ently scatters oﬀ the eﬀective electric ﬁeld of the xenon
atom, thus producing an outgoing photon and inducing
an electronic recoil. This detection channel was ﬁrst con-
sidered only recently for xenon-based detectors in [133]
and [134], which demonstrated that the tension of axion-
photon coupling between the XENON1T excess and stel-
lar constraints can be signiﬁcantly reduced.

Continuing to interpret the excess as a hypothetical
QCD axion signal, we can extend the analysis to make
statements on the axion mass ma under assumptions of
diﬀerent models, as outlined in Sec. II A. As examples, we
consider a DFSZ model with variable βDFSZ and KSVZ
model with variable electromagnetic anomaly E (for sim-
plicity we ﬁx the color anomaly N = 3). Comparing
these two classes of models with our 90% conﬁdence sur-

18

face, we ﬁnd that both are consistent with our result for
a subset of parameters. For the DFSZ model, we ﬁnd
ma ∼ 0.1 − 4.1 eV/c2 and cos2 βDFSZ ∼ 0.01 − 1 would
be consistent with this work. Alternatively, under the
KSVZ model ma ∼ 46 − 56 eV/c2 and E = 6 would be
similarly consistent. These model-speciﬁc mass ranges
are not conﬁdence intervals, as their speciﬁc assumptions
were not included when constructing Fig. 8. We instead
report a single, model-independent conﬁdence region on
the couplings to allow comparison with a variety of mod-
els, not just the examples mentioned here.

Additionally, we describe a direct search for an en-
hanced neutrino magnetic moment. This signal also
has a similar spectrum to the excess observed, but
at 3.2 σ displays a lower signiﬁcance than that from
solar axions. We report a conﬁdence interval of
µν ∈ (1.4, 2.9) × 10−11 µB (90% C.L.), the upper bound-
ary of which is very close to the world-leading direct limit
reported by Borexino [42]. This shows that dark mat-
ter experiments are also sensitive to beyond-SM physics
in the neutrino sector. Here we only search for an en-
hanced neutrino-electron cross-section due to an anoma-
lous magnetic moment, but a similar enhancement would
also occur in neutrino-nucleus scattering [135]. With the
discrimination capabilities of LXe TPCs to ER and NR
events, it would be interesting to consider this channel in
future searches as well.

If from an astrophysical source, the excess presented
here is diﬀerent from the result reported by the DAMA
experiment, which claims that an observed annual mod-
ulation of events between 1 and 6 keV might be due to
a dark matter signal [136, 137]. We present here a lep-
tophilic dark matter model, where WIMPs couple with
electrons through an axial-vector interaction [138]. This
model was used to explain the DAMA signal but was re-
jected already by the XENON100 experiment [139]. In-
terpreting the modulating source observed by DAMA un-
der this model, the expected signal rate in the XENON1T
detector would be more than 2 orders of magnitude
higher than the total event rate we observed, as shown in
Fig. 14. Consequently, the excess observed in this work
is unrelated to the one observed by DAMA.

VI. SUMMARY

We report on searches for new physics using low-energy
electronic recoils in XENON1T. In a search for bosonic
dark matter, world-leading constraints are placed on the
interaction strengths of pseudoscalar and vector parti-
cles. An excess is observed at low energies that is con-
sistent with a solar axion signal, a bosonic dark matter
signal with a mass of 2.3 keV/c2, a solar neutrino signal
with enhanced magnetic moment, or a possible tritium
background. We are unable to conﬁrm nor exclude the
presence of tritium at this time.

In an attempt to understand the low-energy excess, we
performed a number of additional studies. The analysis

Appendix A: β Spectra Modeling

This appendix brieﬂy describes the diﬀerent theoretical
models used in the present work to compute the β spectra
for 214Pb, 212Pb, and 85Kr.

1. GEANT4 Radioactive Decay Module

The Radioactive Decay Module (RDM) in GEANT44
simulates the decay of a given radionuclide using the nu-
clear data taken from an Evaluated Nuclear Structure
Data File (ENSDF) [143]. The required β spectra are
generated in a dedicated class using an analytical model.
The β spectral shape, i.e.
the unnormalized emission
probability per electron energy, is derived from Fermi’s
golden rule as:

dN
dW

∝ pW q2F (Z, W )C(W )S(Z, W ),

(A1)

with Z the atomic number of the daughter nucleus. Here,
W is the total energy of the β particle and is related to
its kinetic energy E by W = 1 + E/me, with me the elec-
tron rest mass. The maximum energy W0 is deﬁned iden-
tically from the energy of the transition E0. The β par-
W 2 − 1 and the (anti)neutrino
ticle momentum is p =
momentum is q = W0 − W , assuming a massless parti-
cle (mν = 0).

√

The Fermi function F (Z, W ) corrects for the static
Coulomb eﬀect of the nucleus on the β particle. Con-
sidering the Coulomb ﬁeld generated by a point-like nu-
cleus, the Dirac equation can be solved analytically and
the well-known expression of the Fermi function can be

4 Here we refer speciﬁcally to the current version 10.6; however the
corrections described in this work have been implemented since
at least version 9.5 [63].

XENON1T data (signal plus background). Dotted lines rep-

XENON1T detector if the DAMA modulated signals are in-

vector interactions. XENON1T data are indicated by black
points and the background model B0 is illustrated by the red

old in this analysis.

of an additional data set called SR2 — which displays a
∼20% lower background rate but only ∼10% statistics
compared to SR1 — is consistent with the SR1 analysis
but largely inconclusive about the nature of the excess.
An S2-only search, which is able to probe sub-keV en-
ergies, similarly yielded consistent constraints for all the
discussed hypotheses. Compared to the excess observed
by DAMA, it is much lower in rate and thereby unrelated.
The signals discussed here can be further explored
in the next-generation detectors, such as the upcom-
ing PandaX-4T [140], LZ [141] and XENONnT [142] ex-
periments. The next phase of the XENON program,
XENONnT, featuring a target mass of 5.9 tonnes and
a factor of ∼6 reduction in ER background, will enable
us to study the excess in much more detail if it persists.
Preliminary studies based on the best-ﬁt results of this
work suggest that a solar axion signal could be diﬀeren-
tiated from a tritium background at the 5 σ level after
only a few months of data from XENONnT.

the Fermi function from [144].

The shape factor C(W ) takes into account the nuclear
and lepton matrix elements. Assuming constant values
of the lepton wave functions within the nuclear volume,
one can demonstrate that allowed and forbidden unique
transitions can be calculated without involving the struc-
ture of the nucleus. For an allowed transition, the shape
factor is constant: C(W ) = 1. In GEANT4, ﬁrst, second
and third forbidden unique transitions are calculated fol-
lowing the approximate expressions given in [145] that
were established by considering the analytical solutions
of the Dirac equation, the same as for the Fermi function.
In any other case, the decay is treated as allowed.

The atomic screening eﬀect corresponds to the inﬂu-
ence of the electron cloud surrounding the daughter nu-
cleus on the β particle wave function. GEANT4 takes
this into account following the most widespread approach
set out by Rose in [146] almost a century ago. For a
β electron, this eﬀect is evaluated by subtracting from
the particle energy W a constant Thomas-Fermi poten-
tial V0 which only depends on Z. This corrected energy
W (cid:48) = W − V0 replaces W in all the quantities required
for the calculation of the spectral shape, except in the
(anti)neutrino energy q because this neutral particle is
not aﬀected by the Coulomb ﬁeld. The parameterization
of the potential used in GEANT4 is close to the prescrip-
tion given in [147]. The screening correction is then given
by:

S(W, Z) =

p(cid:48)W (cid:48)
pW

×

F (Z, W (cid:48))
F (Z, W )

.

(A2)

It is noteworthy that this correction can only be applied
for W ≥ V0, which creates a non-physical discontinuity
in the spectrum at W = V0, as seen in Fig. 15.

IAEA LiveChart

The β spectra available on the IAEA LiveChart web-
site [61] are produced with the ﬁrst version of the Be-
taShape program [148]. The required information for
each transition is taken from the most recent ENSDF ﬁle
with results from the latest nuclear data evaluation [59].
The physics model in BetaShape has already been de-
tailed in [62], except for the atomic screening eﬀect. The
β spectral shape is described in the Behrens and B¨uhring
formalism [149] by:

dN
dW

∝ pW q2F (Z, W )C(W )S(Z, W )R(Z, W ),

(A3)

with all quantities as deﬁned before. The quantity
R(Z, W ) are the radiative corrections described below.

In this formalism, the Fermi function is deﬁned from
the Coulomb amplitudes αk of the relativistic electron
wave functions:

F (Z, W ) = F0L0 =

−1 + α2
α2
+1

.

(A4)

These wave functions are numerical solutions of the Dirac
equation for the Coulomb potential of a nucleus modeled
as a uniformly charged sphere. Indeed, no analytical solu-
tion exists even for such a simple potential; however, the
method from [149] allows for a precise, and fast, calcula-
tion of the Coulomb amplitudes. The method inherently
accounts for the ﬁnite nucleus size while other methods
usually require an analytical correction (L0 in Eq. (A4)).
The total angular momentum change ∆J = |Ji − Jf |
and the parity change πiπf between the initial and ﬁnal
nuclear states are from the input ENSDF ﬁle and deter-
mine the nature of the transition. Given that L = 1 if
∆J = 0 or 1 for an allowed transition, and L = ∆J for
any (L − 1)th forbidden unique transition, the theoretical
shape factor can be expressed as:

C(W ) = (2L − 1)!

tudes αk by:

(A6)

In the case of forbidden non-unique transitions, the
structures of the initial and ﬁnal nuclear states must be
taken into account, which greatly complicates the cal-
culation. The usual approximation consists of treating
such a transition as a forbidden unique transition of iden-
tical ∆J. The validity of this approximation, minutely
tested in [62], can be demonstrated only for some ﬁrst
forbidden non-unique transitions, which are then calcu-
lated as allowed.
Its generalization to every forbidden
non-unique transition is implemented in BetaShape.

The radiative corrections are non-static Coulomb cor-
rections from quantum electrodynamics. They can be
split into two parts:
the inner corrections, which are
independent of the nucleus; and the outer corrections,
which depend on the nucleus. Only the latter depend
on the β particle energy. The outer radiative corrections
R(Z, W ) take into account the internal bremsstrahlung
process, by which the β particles lose energy in the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld of the nucleus. For allowed transitions,
analytical corrections were derived in [150, 151] and are
implemented in the ﬁrst version of BetaShape as de-
scribed in [62].

Finally, the spectral shape is modiﬁed by applying the
screening correction S(W, Z). The BetaShape program
includes an analytical correction based on the work of
B¨uhring [152] that is more precise than Rose’s correction.
The most realistic, spatially varying screened potentials
at the time were of Hulth´en type (see [153] and references
therein). B¨uhring ﬁrst developed a version of the Dirac
equation that correctly includes Hulth´en’s potentials but
simpliﬁed the angular momentum dependency, allowing
analytical solutions to be established [154]. He then per-
formed in [152] a radial expansion at the origin of both

21

the wave functions and the Coulomb potential, includ-
ing Hulth´en’s screened potential, and retained only the
dominant term. This procedure allows the determination
of screened-to-unscreened ratios for the Fermi function
F0L0 and the λk parameters, which are then used to cor-
rect for screening in Eq. (A3). Therefore, the quantity
In
S(Z, W ) in Eq. (A3) is more a symbolic notation.
BetaShape, this approach is used with Salvat’s screened
potentials [155], which can be expanded at the origin as:

A precise description of the exchange eﬀect was set
out in detail in [60, 159], but only for the allowed tran-
sitions. In such a case, β electrons are created in con-
tinuum states with quantum number κ = ±1 and the
selection rules imply that exchange can only occur with
atomic electrons of identical κ, i.e. in s1/2 (κ = −1) and
p1/2 (κ = +1) orbitals. The inﬂuence of the exchange ef-
fect can then be taken into account through a correction
factor on Eq. (A3):

These potentials are widely used for their precision and

It is noteworthy that B¨uhring’s correc-
tion does not create any non-physical discontinuity in the
spectrum as in Rose’s correction. However, it tends to
greatly decrease the emission probability at low energy.

3.

Improved Calculations

When high precision at low energy is required, the
modeling of β− decays must include the atomic screen-
ing and exchange eﬀects. The two approximate screening
corrections previously described are not suﬃcient. The
exchange eﬀect is even more signiﬁcant and comes from
the indistinguishability of the electrons. The regular, di-
rect decay corresponds to the creation of the β electron
in a continuum orbital of the daughter atom. In the ex-
change process, the β electron is created in an atomic or-
bital of the daughter atom and the atomic electron which
was present in the same orbital in the parent atom is
ejected to the continuum. This process leads to the same
ﬁnal state as the direct decay, i.e. one electron in the
continuum, and is possible because the nuclear charge
changes in the decay.

Precise relativistic electron wave functions are neces-
sary to calculate such eﬀects. The numerical procedure
was described in detail in [156], with the nucleus mod-
eled as a uniformly charged sphere. For the continuum
states, the Coulomb potential includes the appropriate
Salvat screened potential. The wave functions, and there-
fore the Fermi function F0L0 and the λk parameters, in-
herently take into account the screening eﬀect. For the
bound states, an exchange potential has to be added to
this Coulomb potential and a speciﬁc procedure was im-
plemented to ensure good convergence to precise atomic

The sums are running over all occupied orbitals of the
daughter atom of same quantum number κ.

It is noteworthy that in [156], only the s1/2 orbitals
were taken into account, following the prescription in
[60]. The “new screening correction” proposed in [156]
was necessary to reproduce the experimental β spectra
of 63Ni and 241Pu, but was later found to be incompat-
ible with a rigorous derivation of the β spectrum start-
ing from the decay Hamiltonian and the corresponding
S matrix. If correct screening and exchange eﬀect with
s1/2 and p1/2 orbitals are considered, together with pre-
cise atomic orbital energies, excellent agreement over the
entire energy range of the two spectra is obtained.

Finally, more precise radiative corrections have been
considered compared with those previously described.
They were developed using more recent mathematical
techniques and a signiﬁcant change in the correction
terms was found [160]. Describing the various changes is

out of the scope of the present work; however, many de-
tails can be found in [161]. The inﬂuence of these new ra-
diative corrections on the integrated β spectrum is given
for twenty superallowed transitions in [162], for which an
excellent agreement is obtained with the present imple-
mentation. It appears that these corrections are signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than the previous ones, especially for high
atomic numbers.

4. Application to the Transitions of Interest

These diﬀerent models have been applied to the
ground-state to ground-state transitions in 212Pb, 214Pb,
and 85Kr decays. The resulting spectra are similar to
each other in the major part of the energy range, except
at low energy.

The diﬀerences are illustrated in Fig. 15 for the low
energy region of the 214Pb β spectrum. The yellow curve
is the GEANT4 RDM model as described in A 1 and the
non-physical discontinuity due to the screening correc-
tion is clearly visible at 12 keV. The red curve is from
IAEA LiveChart, thus generated by the ﬁrst version of
the BetaShape program as described in A 2. One can
see the eﬀect of B¨uhring screening correction that tends
to decrease the emission probability. The cyan and blue
curves were determined as described in A 3, without and
with the atomic exchange correction, respectively. The
screening eﬀect is found to have a much smaller inﬂuence
on the spectral shape when determined using a full nu-
merical procedure than when applying an analytical ap-
proximation. However, the atomic exchange eﬀect has a
strong inﬂuence, as expected from previous studies [156].

FIG. 15. Low energy part of the β spectral shape of the
ground-state to ground-state transition in 214Pb decay. This
ﬁrst forbidden non-unique transition was calculated as al-
lowed in every case but with diﬀerent levels of approximations,
as described in the text. The four spectra are normalized by
area over the full energy range. See text for details on the
shape of each spectrum.

Both transitions in 212Pb and 214Pb ground-state to

22

ground-state decays were calculated as allowed, accord-
ingly with the approximation described in A 2. It is im-
portant to keep in mind that formally, such ﬁrst forbid-
den non-unique transitions should be determined includ-
ing the structure of the initial and ﬁnal nuclear states,
a much more complicated calculation that is beyond the
present scope.

The transition in 85Kr decay is ﬁrst forbidden unique
and can thus be calculated accurately without nuclear
structure. The description of the exchange eﬀect from
[60, 159] used here is only valid for allowed transitions.
For a ﬁrst forbidden unique transition, one can expect a
contribution of the κ = ±2 atomic orbitals but the exact
solutions have still to be derived. However, the spectral
shape is derived from a multipole expansion of the nu-
clear and lepton currents, as shown in the shape factor
in Eq. (A5). Therefore, one can expect that the allowed
exchange correction should give the main contribution,
and this was done to determine the 85Kr β spectrum.

The tritium β spectrum used in this work was ob-
tained from the IAEA LiveChart [61], thus calculated
using the standard Fermi function without corrections.
As 3H decays via an allowed transition, this spectrum
is suﬃciently precise at energies above 0.5 keV, as con-
ﬁrmed experimentally in [82].

5. Uncertainties

The dominant

continuous
contribution to
XENON1T low-energy background comes from 214Pb
β decay. We thus focus the uncertainty discussion
on the 214Pb ground-state to ground-state transition,
calculated for the ﬁnal model (blue curve in Fig. 15).

the

The transition energy is directly given by the Q-
value [163]: Qβ = 1018(11) keV. This uncertainty
can be propagated by calculating the spectrum at
(1018 ± 11) keV, namely at 1σ. The result is an enve-
lope centered on the spectrum calculated at the Q-value,
which provides an uncertainty on the emission proba-
bility for each energy bin. The relative uncertainty is
1.7% below 10 keV and 1.1% at 210 keV. However, most
of this uncertainty is removed because the 214Pb spec-
trum is left unconstrained in the ﬁtting procedure. The
remaining uncertainty component on the emission prob-
ability is ∼ 0.5% for each energy bin, in which the shape
of the spectrum cannot vary steeply.

The atomic screening eﬀect only slightly modiﬁes the
shape of the β spectrum.
Its uncertainty contribution
can thus be safely ignored. The atomic exchange eﬀect
strongly aﬀects the spectral shape below 5 keV, and its
accuracy depends on the atomic model used. For the β
spectra of 63Ni and 241Pu, the residuals between their
high-precision measurement and the improved calcula-
tion in A 3 showed that the agreement is better than
the statistical ﬂuctuations due to the number of counts
in each energy channel, from 0.5 keV to the endpoint en-
ergy. A conservative value of 1% for each energy bin is the

maximum relative uncertainty and is the value adopted
here.

The 214Pb transition of interest is ﬁrst forbidden non-
unique. As explained in A 4, the nuclear structure should
be taken into account for such a transition because it has
an inﬂuence on the spectral shape. Treating it as an al-
lowed transition induces an inaccuracy which cannot be
estimated by comparison with a measured spectrum –
no measurement has been reported so far. In the same
mass region, the 210Bi decay exhibits also a ﬁrst forbid-
den non-unique, ground-state to ground-state transition
with a comparable Q-value, and an experimental shape
factor is available. As can be seen in [164], treating this
transition as allowed leads to an important discrepancy
with measurement. The question is then how this ob-
servation can be used for assessing an uncertainty to the
214Pb spectral shape.

First, allowing the rate normalization to be free in
the (1, 210) keV region absorbs the vast majority of
any diﬀerence. Second, the nuclear structures of 210Bi
and 214Pb are not identical. The 210Bi decay can be
seen as two nucleons in the valence space above the
doubly-magic 208Pb core, with the initial conﬁguration

(p, 1h9/2)(n, 2g9/2) and two protons in the 1h9/2 orbital
in the ﬁnal state. However, this picture is too simple to
be accurate because the core is not really inert. Nucle-
ons from the core can give contributions to the β decay
matrix elements, mainly through meson exchange eﬀects
In 214Pb decay, a
and core polarization eﬀects [165].
single proton in the 1h9/2 orbital is present in the ﬁ-
nal state and in the initial state, six neutrons are spread
over the orbitals of the valence space but tend to couple
to each other through pairing and dominantly occupy
the 2g9/2 orbital. Contributions from the core nucleons
can be expected to be relatively small compared to the
main (n, 2g9/2) → (p, 1h9/2) transition. In addition, even
though it is diﬃcult to predict if the nuclear structure
component shifts the spectrum to lower energies, as for
210Bi, or to higher energies, a steep variation at low en-
ergy is not realistic.

To conclude, we conservatively estimate a relative un-
certainty on the spectral shape of 5% due to the nuclear
structure component and an additional 1% for the en-
ergy dependency of the relative uncertainty on the maxi-
mum energy. Thus a 6% total uncertainty on the spectral
shape is estimated for the 214Pb β-decay model in this
work.
