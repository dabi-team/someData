Abstract: We used the Blast wave model with Boltzmann Gibbs statistics and analyzed the
experimental data of transverse momentum spectra (pT ) measured by NA61/SHINE and NA
49 Collaborations in inelastic (INEL) proton-proton, and the most central Beryllium-Beryllium
(Be-Be), Argon-Scandium (Ar-Sc) and Lead-Lead (Pb-Pb) collisions. The model results ﬁt the
experimental data of NA61/SHINE and NA 49 Collaborations very well. We extracted kinetic
freezeout temperature, transverse ﬂow velocity and kinetic freezeout volume directly from the
spectra. We also calculated mean transverse momentum and initial temperature from the ﬁt
function. It is observed that the kinetic freezeout temperature increases with increasing the collision
energy as well as collision cross-section (size of the colliding system). Furthermore, the transverse
ﬂow remains unchanged with increasing the collision energy, while it changes randomly with the
collision cross-section. Similarly, with the increase in collision energy or the collision cross-section,
the freeze-out volume and the average pT increase. The initial temperature is also observed to be
an increasing function of the collision cross-section.

INTRODUCTION

A new state of matter, namely Quark-Gluon Plasma
(QGP), is formed under the extreme conditions of tem-
perature and energy densities. This matter is formed in
the early stages of the collisions and have a very short life-
time of almost 7-10 fm/c, after which it changes quickly
to a system of hadron gas. Due to multi- partonic inter-
actions in the collision system, the information about the

‡Correspondence: a.hajismail@ajman.ac.ae

initial condition gets lost and we can get the ﬁnal state
behavior of such systems from measure of numbers and
identity of produced particles along with their energy and
transverse momentum spectra.

During heavy ion collisions, the constituents of hot
and dense matter interact elastically or inelastically with
each other and evolves into a new state of free matter.
This phenomenon of particles decoupling is called freeze-
out. There are two kinds of freezeout. When the colliding
medium reaches a stage of chemical equilibrium and then
cools down by expansion. The inelastic collisions stop
due to the expansion of the system, and the mean free
path for the interactions becomes comparable to the size
of the system. In addition, the abundances of diﬀerent

 
 
 
 
 
 
particle species get ﬁxed. This is referred as chemical
freezeout. The chemical freezeout stage is followed by
another stage, although the relative fractions of the par-
ticles are ﬁxed, they continue to interact with each other
until the ﬁnal state interactions between the particles are
no longer eﬀective. This is known as kinetic freezeout.
At the stage of kinetic freezeout, all the interactions stop
and the transverse momentum spectra of the particles do
not change. Therefore, the transverse momentum spec-
tra of the particles are very important due to the reason
that it contains the necessary information about the ﬁnal
state particles, including the kinetic freezeout tempera-
ture (T0), transverse ﬂow velocity (βT ), kinetic freezeout
volume (V ) and time of ﬂight of the particles.

The above discussed freezeout stages correspond to
the chemical freezeout temperature (Tch) and kinetic
freezeout temperature (T0) respectively. In addition to
the two kind of temperatures, the initial temperature (Ti)
is also important because of its determining eﬀect to the
evolution system.

Large collision systems are expected to form QGP
matter, however small systems (especially with low mul-
tiplicity) are expected to create it due to the reason that
they have a small volume of violent collision regions.
From the similar multiplicity at the energy range up to
200 GeV, small systems are more similar to peripheral
AA collisions, however, they are not similar to central
AA collisions [1]. At low energies from a few GeV to 10
GeV, the situation is diﬀerent due to the dominance of
baryons [2].

In the present work, we will use the Blast Wave model
with Boltzmann Gibbs statistics [3, 4, 5] to analyze the
transverse momentum spectra of the pion in diﬀerent col-
lisions system at diﬀerent energies and will extract the ki-
netic freezeout temperature, transverse ﬂow velocity and
kinetic freezeout volume. We will show the dependence
of the above parameters on collision energy and collision
cross-section. The dependence of these parameters are
in contradiction in diﬀerent literatures [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In fact, it is very
useful to do more studies on these topics and to ﬁnalize
some corroborative conclusions. In addition, we will also
extract the initial temperature (Ti) and average trans-
verse momentum (< pT >) from the ﬁt function to show
their dependence on collision energy and collision cross-
section.

Before going to the next section, we would like to
point out that we choose the Blast Wave model with
Boltzmann Gibbs statistics in the present work because
it is very close to ideal gas model, and the reason behind

2

the selection of pion is that the temperature obtained
from its spectra is the closest to the source temperature.

II. FORMALISM AND METHOD

In high energy collisions, the pT spectra of the pro-
duced particles is very complex. Although the function
can be of various forms, it is not enough to use a single
probability density function to describe the pT spectra
(especially when the maximum pT is up to 100 GeV/c)
[20]. There are various pT regions [21] according to the
model analysis that are described in our previous work
[22]. The soft excitation and hard scattering are the two
main processes for particle production. The soft excita-
tion process results in the production of most light ﬂavor
particles whose pT range is narrow (less than 2–3 GeV/c),
while hard scattering process exists in a wide pT range
(pT >3 GeV/c), in addition, some light ﬂavor particles
are also produced in this process. In some cases of not
too high collision energies, the hard scattering process
can be underestimated and the soft excitation plays the
main role in the particle production. Similar or diﬀerent
probability density functions describe the soft and hard
scattering processes. In general, due to the small fraction
of the hard process in narrow pT range, the hard scat-
tering process does not contribute in temperature and
ﬂow velocity. For soft excitation process, we have various
choices of formalisms which include but are not limited
to the standard distribution [23], Tsallis statistics [24–
26], Erlang distribution [27–29], Schwinger mechanism
[30–33], the Blast Wave model with Boltzmann Gibbs
statistics [4 ,34], Blast Wave model with Tsallis statistics
[35–37] and Hagedorn thermal model distribution [38].

In the present work, we used the Blast Wave model
with Boltzmann Gibbs statitics (BGBW), which assumes
that the particles are locally thermalized at the ther-
mal/kinetic freezeout temperature, and are moving with
a common transverse collective ﬂow velocity [4, 39]. Let
us assume a thermal source, which is radially boosted,
has kinetic freezeout temperature (T0) and a transverse
radial ﬂow velocity (βT ), the transverse momentum (pT )
spectra distribution of the particles is

proﬁle, (r/R) represents the relative radial position in
thermal source. The average β(r) can be obtained from
< βT >=2βS/(n0+2), where n0 is the self similar ﬂow
velocity proﬁle and its value can be 1 [13] or 2 [39] or
it may also be considered a free parameter [40]. In some
cases, it is possible that BGBW does not ﬁt the whole pT
region, then we use two-component of the model, which
is not discussed in the present work. However the whole
methodology of the two component model is discussed in
detail in our previous work [14, 22, 41].

In the ﬁt process, the extracted parameters has usu-
ally a correlation, such as T0 in some cases is larger and
a smaller βT can lead to a similar result if a smaller T0
and larger βT are used. This is due to the inﬂuence of
pT range, and also n0 if taken as free parameter. To re-
duce the eﬀect of such correlation, we need to analyze
the mean pT (< pT >) and the root-mean square pT
over √2 (
T > /2). We can calculate < pT > and
< p2

y

The transverse momentum (pT ) spectra of π− mseons
produced in inelastic (INEL) proton-proton (pp)
,
Beryllium-Beryllium (Be-Be), Argon-Scandium (Ar-Sc)
and Lead-Lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at diﬀerent energies are
represented in ﬁg. 1. Panel (a)-(d) show the pT spectra
of pion in inelastic (INEL) p-p collision, and the most
central Be-Be, Ar-Sc and Pb-Pb collisions respectively
= 0.1 rapidity. The symbols represent the experi-
at
mental data of NA61/SHINE [45, 46, 47] and NA49 Col-
laboration [48, 49] measured at the SPS CERN, while
the curve represents the result of our ﬁt by the Blast
Wave model with Boltzmann Gibbs statistics. On can see
that Eq. (1) approximately describes the experimental
data well and the related parameters are extracted
from the ﬁt of Eq. (1) to the data by using the
least square method. The data in ﬁg. 1(a), 1(b) and
[45], [46] and [47] respectively,
1(c) are taken from ref.
while the data in panel (d) is taken from ref.
[48, 49].
In order to see the ﬁt results clearly, the spectra of pion
in pp collisions at 40, 80 and 158 A GeV/c in panel (a)
are scaled by 4, 14 and 40, respectively.
In panel (b),
at 30, 40 and 150 A GeV/c, the spectra are scaled by

3

4, 2 and 1/8, respectively. While in panel (c), at 40, 80
and 160 A GeV/c, the spectra are scaled by 20, 8 and 4,
respectively.

The lower layer in each panel represents the corre-
sponding ratio of data/ﬁt. The related values of free
parameters and χ2 and degrees of freedom (dof) are pre-
sented in table 1. One can see that Eq. (1) provides an
approximately well ﬁt to the data in all collisions at all
energies.

The least square method is used by us in the ﬁt pro-
cess to get the minimum χ2.
In ﬁg.1, the χ2 in some
cases are large which show the large dispersion between
the curve and data, but the ﬁtting is approximately ac-
ceptable. However in most cases the experimental data
is described well by the model in the pT spectra of the
pions produced in diﬀerent collisions at diﬀerent energies.

To study the change in the trend of parameters with
collision energy and collision cross-section, Fig. 2 shows
the dependencies of kinetic freezeout temperature (T0),
transverse ﬂow velocity (βT ) and kinetic freezeout vol-
ume (V ) on collision energy and collision cross-section.
Panel (a), (b) and (c) show the result for kinetic freezeout
temperature, transverse ﬂow velocity and kinetic freeze-
out volume, respectively. Diﬀerent symbols represent dif-
ferent collision systems. The trend of parameters from
left to right shows the energy dependence of the corre-
sponding parameter, while from up to down the diﬀerent
symbols show the collision cross-section dependence of
the corresponding parameters. In panel (a), the depen-
dence of kinetic freezeout temperature on the collisions
energy and collision cross-section is shown. We observed
that as the collision energy increases, T0 also increases.
The reason behind it is that at high energies, the collision
is very violent which gives a higher excitation to the sys-
tem. The higher energies, the higher degree of excitation
the system will get. Furthermore, it is also observed that
T0 in pp collisions is less than in the other three collisions,
while in Pb-Pb is the largest, followed by Ar+Sc and then
Be-Be collisions. It clearly indicates that T0 depends on
the collision cross-section interaction. Larger the colli-
sion cross-section, larger T0. Proton-proton is a small
collision system and have smaller collision cross-section,
while Lead-Lead is the largest collision system and there-
fore it has the largest T0. This is in agreement with [14].
Panel (b) shows the dependence of βT on energy and col-
lision cross-section. At the present we observed that βT
remains unchanged with increasing the collision energy.
We believe that is due to the reason that collective behav-
ior does not change with increasing energy. In addition,
βT changes randomly for every system. There is no de-

Fig.1. Transverse momentum spectra of π− produced in pp, and the most central Be-Be, Ar-Sc and Pb-Pb collisions at
diﬀerent energies at |y| = 0.1 rapidity interval. The symbols are the experimental data of NA61/SHINE [45, 46, 47] and NA49
Collaboration [48, 49] measured at the SPS CERN, and the curves are our ﬁt by using Eq. (1). The corresponding data/ﬁt
ratios are are followed in each panel.

pendence of βT observed on the collision cross-section. In
panel (c), the dependence of V on collision energy and
collision cross-section is represented. One can see that V
increases as the collision energy increases. The reason be-
hind it is that there is a larger initial bulk system at high
energies. The increase in energy results in longer evo-
lution time which corresponds to larger partonic system
and the kinetic freezeout volume becomes larger in large
partonic system. Furthermore, we also observed that the
freezeout volume is larger for Pb-Pb collisions, followed
by Ar-Sc and then Be-Be collisions, and it is the lowest
in pp collisions. This clearly indicates its dependence on
the collision cross-section (size of the interacting system).

Fig. 3(a) shows the dependence of < pT > and Ti

on collision energy and collision cross-section. One can
see that < pT > increases with an increase of collisions
energy and also collision cross-section because larger mo-
mentum (energy) is transferred at higher energies and
large collision systems, which results in further multiple
scattering. However in ﬁg. 3(b), the dependence of initial
temperature (Ti) on energy and collision cross-section is
represented. One can see that Ti increase with increas-
ing the collision energy and is larger for large collision
cross-section system.

We observed that the initial temperature is larger
than the kinetic freezeout temperature. Generally, the
initial temperature is larger than the eﬀective temper-
ature and the eﬀective temperature is larger than the

the initial and kinetic freezeout temperatures generally,
and is slightly larger than or approximately equal to the
eﬀective temperature, and this order is in agreement with
the order of time evolution of the interacting system.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We summarize here our main observations and con-

clusions as follows.

(a) The transverse momentum spectra of pion pro-
duced in inelastic proton-proton, and most central Be-
Be, Ar-Sc and Pb-Pb collisions at diﬀerent energies have
been studied by the Blast Wave model with Boltzmann
Gibbs statistics. The results are in agreement with the
experimental data measured by the NA61/SHINE and
NA49 Collaboration at CERN.

in the system at higher energies and in large colliding
systems.

(c) The transverse ﬂow velocity is observed to remain
constant with the increase of energy due to the invari-
ant collective ﬂow with increasing energy. There is no
dependence of βT on the collision cross-section.

(d) The kinetic freezeout volume increases with in-
creasing the collision energy due to large initial bulk at
higher energies, and it is also larger for large collision
systems.

(e) The mean transverse momentum increases with
increasing the collision energy due to more transfer
of energy in the system at higher energies.
It is also
observed that < pT > is larger for large colliding systems
because in large colliding systems the transfer of energy
is large.
