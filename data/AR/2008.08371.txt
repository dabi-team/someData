ABSTRACT

Context. Gaia benchmark stars are selected to be calibration stars for diﬀerent spectroscopic surveys. Very high-quality and homoge-
neous spectroscopic data for these stars are therefore required. We collected ultrahigh-resolution ESPRESSO spectra for 30 of the 34
Gaia benchmark stars and made them public.
Aims. We quantify the consistency of the results that are obtained with diﬀerent high- (R ∼ 115 000), and ultrahigh- (R ∼ 220 000)
resolution spectrographs. We also comprehensively studied the eﬀect of using diﬀerent spectral reduction products of ESPRESSO on
the ﬁnal spectroscopic results.
Methods. We used ultrahigh- and high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectrographs to mea-
sure spectral line characteristics (line depth; line width; and equivalent width, EW) and determined stellar parameters and abundances
for a subset of 11 Gaia benchmark stars. We used the ARES code for automatic measurements of the spectral line parameters.
Results. Our measurements reveal that the same individual spectral lines measured from adjacent 2D (spectrum in the wavelength-
order space) echelle orders of ESPRESSO spectra diﬀer slightly in line depth and line width. When a long list of spectral lines is
considered, the EW measurements based on the 2D and 1D (the ﬁnal spectral product) ESPRESSO spectra agree very well. The EW
spectral line measurements based on the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectra also agree to within a few percent. However, we
note that the lines appear deeper in the ESPRESSO spectra than in PEPSI and HARPS. The stellar parameters derived from each
spectrograph by combining the several available spectra agree well overall.
Conclusions. We conclude that the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectrographs can deliver spectroscopic results that are suf-
ﬁciently consistent for most of the science cases in stellar spectroscopy. However, we found small but important diﬀerences in the
performance of the three spectrographs that can be crucial for speciﬁc science cases.

1. Introduction

Stellar spectra contain a wealth of information about the forma-
tion, evolution, and current characteristics of stars. The amount
and robustness of the information that can be extracted from
spectra depends on their quality: the higher the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) and spectral resolution (R), the more detailed and
precise the extracted information. In addition to these proper-
ties, the homogeneity of the data and analysis method becomes

crucial for comparative studies among several stars. These ob-
vious factors (high quality and homogeneity) are the base for
the success of small and large surveys. Representative examples
of small programs are the solar-twin observations made with
the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS)
by Nissen (2015), the HARPS Guaranteed Time Observations
(GTO) survey for exoplanet and galactic stellar populations stud-
ies (Adibekyan et al. 2013, 2012b), and the AMBRE1 project
(de Laverny et al. 2012). The large successful spectroscopic sur-
veys include the Gaia-ESO (Gilmore et al. 2012) and the Apache

Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE -
Majewski et al. 2017) surveys, to mention a few.

Several additional very large ground-based spectroscopic
surveys of Milky Way stars are ongoing, with the common goal
of understanding the formation and structure of our Galaxy (e.g.,
GALAH2 (De Silva et al. 2015), LAMOST3 (Deng et al. 2012),
SDSS4 (Yanny et al. 2009), and RAVE5 (Steinmetz et al. 2006)).
The Gaia space mission (Perryman et al. 2001) beautifully com-
plements this list of ground-based surveys. Depending on the
speciﬁcations of the science goals and instrument conﬁguration,
these surveys use diﬀerent methods and techniques to provide
their ﬁnal scientiﬁc products (e.g., stellar parameters and chem-
ical abundances). It is therefore not straightforward to combine
scientiﬁc outputs from diﬀerent surveys without common stan-
dard stars for calibration.

A massive eﬀort has been made by the Gaia-ESO scientiﬁc
community to deﬁne a list of 34 FGK stars (including the Sun)
and M giants that can be used as benchmarks (Heiter et al. 2015).
Most of these stars, called Gaia benchmark stars, have interfero-
metric observations that allow fundamental, that is, less model-
dependent and spectrum-independent, methods to be used to
determine their eﬀective temperature and surface gravity. Five
metal-poor candidates were later added to the list (Hawkins et al.
2016). However, these new targets do not have interferomet-
ric observations, like the initial Gaia benchmarks do. Because
the spectra of these stars were obtained from diﬀerent high-
resolution (HR) spectrographs, they were ﬁrst convolved and
resampled to the lowest resolution (ﬁrst to R∼70 000 and later
convolved to a common resolution of R∼47 000) of the spec-
trographs and to cover the visible range from 480 to 680 nm
(Blanco-Cuaresma et al. 2014). The spectra from this homoge-
nized library were used for further spectroscopic analyses of the
stars with diﬀerent methods by diﬀerent groups (see, e.g., Jofr´e
et al. 2014, 2015). We refer to Jofr´e et al. (2017) for further de-
tails and references.

However, when very high precision in stellar parameters and
chemical abundances are the aim, then even a higher resolution
and intrinsic homogeneity of the spectra might be required. An
important work toward creating a truly homogeneous ultrahigh-
resolution (UHR) library of Gaia benchmark and other standard
stars has recently been performed by Strassmeier et al. (2018b).
The authors observed 48 bright AFGKM stars, including 23 of
the Gaia benchmark stars, with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric
and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) spectrograph installed at
the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona (Strassmeier
et al. 2015). These spectra have an average R∼220 000, a wave-
length coverage of 383–912 nm, and a S/N in the combined spec-
tra that ranges from 70 to 6 000, depending on the star and wave-
length region. In addition to achieving a very precise determina-
tion of global stellar parameters, the authors demonstrated the
high potential of using these UHR spectra by detecting the rare-
earth element dysprosium and other diﬃcult-to-measure heavy
elements, such as uranium and thorium. The authors also mea-
sured 12C/13C isotope ratios, which have very important impli-
cations for diﬀerent ﬁelds of stellar astrophysics and planet en-
gulfment theories (e.g., Privitera et al. 2016), and even for the
search for solar siblings (Adibekyan et al. 2018).

As mentioned above, only 23 of the 34 Gaia benchmark
stars have been observed with PEPSI. This is because the ma-

jority of these benchmark stars are located in the southern hemi-
sphere. The Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and
Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) spectrograph
(Pepe et al. 2010; Gonz´alez Hern´andez et al. 2018), installed at
the Very Large Telescope (VLT), presented us with the unique
opportunity of observing the southern benchmark stars at a reso-
lution higher than 220 000. Our team seized this opportunity and
observed 30 of the Gaia benchmark stars in a uniform fashion.
The remaining four targets are not observable with ESPRESSO
but have previously been observed with PEPSI. The science-
ready 1D combined ESPRESSO spectra of the 30 Gaia bench-
mark stars are made public and can be downloaded from our
dedicated webpage6.

The PEPSI and ESPRESSO instruments are new, have dif-
ferent speciﬁcations (because their scientiﬁc goals are diﬀer-
ent), and are unique (spectral coverage and resolution), thus it
is important to verify whether these two benchmark spectro-
graphs give consistent results. It has been shown that when stel-
lar parameters are compared that were derived from diﬀerent
spectra, obtained with diﬀerent instruments (i.e., spectral res-
olution and wavelength coverage), and under diﬀerent observ-
ing and meteorological conditions, the choice of the instrument
plays a major eﬀect (see, e.g., Bedell et al. 2014; Bensby et al.
2014). Although the resulting diﬀerences are acceptably small
for most of the science cases (Sousa et al. 2018), they can be
very important when very ﬁne diﬀerences in chemical abun-
dances between binary stars (e.g., Saﬀe et al. 2016; Adibekyan
et al. 2016; Ram´ırez et al. 2019), abundance diﬀerences between
stars with and without planets (e.g., Adibekyan et al. 2012a,
2015b; Gonz´alez Hern´andez et al. 2010, 2013; Delgado Mena
et al. 2018), or the composition of diﬀerent galactic populations
are studied (Nissen & Schuster 2010; Adibekyan et al. 2011;
Bergemann et al. 2014; Spina et al. 2016; Nissen et al. 2020).

The main aim of this work is to make a detailed compari-
son of the spectral data products of ESPRESSO and PEPSI. We
did not directly compare the spectra, but the properties of spec-
tral lines (line depths; widths; and equivalent widths, EW). This
is a very important test for the scientiﬁc community to know at
which level these UHR spectrographs are compatible. In addi-
tion, we compared the spectroscopic results obtained with these
two spectrographs with those taken with the HARPS spectro-
graph. HARPS has a spectral resolution of about 115 000 (nearly
half of the resolution of PEPSI and ESPRESSO) and has been
and contiues to be one of the most frequently used ESO spectro-
graphs since its commissioning in 2002 (Mayor et al. 2003).

The outline of this manuscript is as follows: in Sect. 2 we
brieﬂy describe the sample. At the beginning of Sect. 3 we
brieﬂy described the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Then, in Sects
3.2, 3.3, 3.4, B, and C we compare the spectral line properties
in detail, based on measurements from the ESPRESSO spec-
tra taken for the Sun in diﬀerent formats. The comparison of
the spectroscopic results based on the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and
HARPS spectra for the becnhmark stars is presented in Sect. 4.
A summary of the results is provided in Sect. 5.

2. Sample

During ESO periods P102-P104 we observed 30 (out of 34)
Gaia benchmark stars with the ESPRESSO spectrograph in UHR
mode. In this mode the spectral resolution is four times higher
than the nominal (minimum) resolution of the spectra collected

in Blanco-Cuaresma et al. (2014). Fig. 1 illustrates the eﬀect of
this diﬀerence in spectral resolution for τ Cet, the slowest rotat-
ing (vsin i < 1 km/s) star in our sample7. The distribution of these
stars in the Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) diagram is presented in
Fig. 2, and their stellar characteristics together with the S/N of
the ESPRESSO spectra are presented in Table A.1. Twenty of
these 30 stars also have UHR PEPSI observations, and for 18 of
them, HR spectra were obtained with HARPS.

From the 18 stars with ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS
observations we excluded 3 stars (HD 84937, HD 140283, and
HD 122563) with [Fe/H] < -2 dex, 2 stars (α Cet and α Tau) with
Teﬀ < 4000 K, and 2 stars (η Boo and HD 49933) with vsin i >
10 km/s. The reason for this was that we wished to avoid spectra
with very weak (metal-poor stars), blended (cool stars), and very
broad (fast rotators) spectral lines, which are diﬃcult to measure
with automatic spectral line ﬁtting tools. The resulting sample of
11 stars is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2, and their char-
acteristics are presented in Table 1. The S/N at ∼5800 Å for the
HARPS and ESPRESSO combined spectra was calculated from
the ﬂux (photon counts) and for the PEPSI spectra, the S/N was
taken from Strassmeier et al. (2018b,a). These values are pre-
sented in Table 1 as well.

We used a list of about 460 spectral lines belonging to 28 dif-
ferent chemical species from carbon to neodymium (Adibekyan
et al. 2012c, 2015a; Sousa et al. 2008; Delgado Mena et al.
2017). The spectral line properties were measured with the au-
tomatic ARES v2 code8 (Sousa et al. 2015a). ARES performs a
local continuum normalization around each spectral line and ﬁts
Gaussian proﬁles to measure the line properties.

3. Exploring the internal consistency of ESPRESSO

spectra using solar data

High-precision stellar spectroscopy requires high-resolution and
high S/N spectra. These HR spectra are typically taken with

their original R ∼ 115 000 resolution.

cross-dispersed echelle spectrographs, the reduction of which is
diﬃcult (Piskunov & Valenti 2002; Prugniel & Soubiran 2001).
In October and November 2018, we obtained ﬁve ESPRESSO
UHR spectra of the Sun reﬂected from Vesta. The S/N of these
spectra ranges from about 200 to 300. In this section we use
these spectra at diﬀerent stages of reduction and with diﬀerent
formats to study their eﬀect on the spectral line properties.

3.1. The ESPRESSO spectrograph

ESPRESSO is a ﬁbre-fed, cross-dispersed, high-resolution
echelle spectrograph installed at the VLT (ESO). The spectro-
graph was designed to achieve a 10 cm s−1 – level precision in
radial velocity.

The spectral resolution of ESPRESSO can be ∼70 000 (mul-
tiMR mode), ∼140 000 (singleHR mode), or up to ∼220 000
(singleUHR) depending on the conﬁguration. Because a pupil
slicer (anamorphic pupil slicing unit) is used at the entrance
of the spectrograph, ESPRESSO delivers two simultaneously
observed spectra of the same target for the singleHR and sin-
gleUHR modes. The spectrograph produces 85 interference or-
ders over two detectors, which together cover a wavelength
range between 3782 and 7887 Å. Within a single interference or-
der, the transmission variations are dominated by the blaze func-
tion9. At the boundary wavelengths (∼5250 Å) of the blue- and
red-arm detectors the eﬃciency is slightly lower because of the
dichroic that splits the light into the two arms (see Fig. 3).

The ﬁnal data products generated by the ESPRESSO Data
Reduction Software (DRS) include an extracted blaze-corrected

9 The blaze function is the chromatic variation of transmission and
results form the interference patterns of the grooves of the echelle grat-
ing. For echelle gratings operating at high resolution, the small grove
spacings leads to broad blaze functions that for eﬃciency, peak close to
the center of the order and have minimum values at the edges.

2D spectrum (spectrum in the wavelength-order space, called
S2D in DRS) and a merged, blaze-corrected, rebinned 1D spec-
trum (called S1D in DRS). The S1D and S2D spectra are brought
to the baricenter of the Solar System by applying the Earth radial
velocity measured along the line of sight at the time of the ob-
servation to the wavelength solution. For a detailed description
of the spectrograph and its performance, we refer to Pepe et al.
(2020, submitted). Further information about the spectrograph is
available in the ESPRESSO User Manual documents10.

3.2. Lines in multiple spectral orders

ESPRESSO, like many multiple-order echelle spectrographs,
has contiguous orders that cover the same wavelength range.
Because of this overlap, some spectral lines appear in multiple
spectral orders. It is very common to observe diﬀerences of up
to a few percent in the line parameters observed in adjacent or-
ders for echelle spectrographs (e.g., Suzuki et al. 2003; ˇSkoda
& Hensberge 2003; Hensberge 2004). Diﬀerent approaches are
proposed to solve the inconsistencies when the spectral orders
are merged (e.g., Erspamer & North 2002; Hensberge 2007;

Fig. 4. Absolute (left panel) and relative (normalized to the size
of the echelle order) distance (right panel) of the spectral lines
from the center of the ESPRESSO spectral orders. The aver-
age distance is shown for lines observed in multiple orders. The
boundary wavelength region (at ∼5250 Å) of the blue- and red-
arm detectors is indicated by the rectangle.

Brahm et al. 2017). In this section we compare the spectral line
parameters as measured in multiple orders of the 2D spectra.

In Fig. 4 we show the distance of the selected spectral lines
from the centers of the spectral orders. For the lines observed
in multiple orders, the average distance to the respective order’s
center is presented. We note that for lines observed in two or-
ders, the relative average distance from the order centers is 0.5,
that is, half the distance (in angstroms) between the centers of
two adjacent orders. About 35% of the lines are observed in two
orders, and 64% are only observed in single orders. About 1%
of the lines with wavelengths close to the boundary wavelength
(∼5250 Å) of the blue and red arms appear in three orders. The
overlap in wavelength coverage in orders is maximized to guar-
antee full coverage at the cutoﬀ wavelengths. The ﬁgure shows
that lines in single orders have shorter distances from the center
of the orders than their counterparts observed in multiple orders.
Because in an echelle spectrograph the wavelength coverage per
order increases with wavelength, the average distance increases
in the same way.

In Fig. 5 we show how the relative and absolute diﬀerences
of spectral line parameters (EW; line depth; and full width at
half maximum, FWHM) as measured in diﬀerent echelle orders
depend on wavelength, EW, and the diﬀerence in distance from
the centers of the spectral orders (“∆ dist. from orders centers”).
This diﬀerence in distances from order centers, as the name sug-
gests, is calculated as the diﬀerence of the spectral line distances

from the adjacent order centers. For example, if its value is zero,
then the line is located at the same distance from the centers
of the two orders. A negative value means that the distance of
the line from the longer wavelength order center is larger than
its distance from the shorter wavelength order center (e.g., the
5584.77 Å line in Fig. 3).

The relative diﬀerences of the line characteristics were calcu-
lated in the following way. For each solar spectrum and for each
spectral order, we measured the line parameters with ARES.
Then for each line observed in multiple orders we calculated the
relative diﬀerence (diﬀerence divided by the mean) in the line
parameter. As a ﬁnal relative diﬀerence for each spectral line pa-
rameter, we used the average value of diﬀerences obtained for
the ﬁve solar spectra. Lines with very large relative diﬀerences
(more than 3σ diﬀerent from the mean values calculated for all
the lines) in parameters were considered as outliers and removed
from the analysis. One of the main sources for the inaccurate line
measurements (outliers) are telluric lines. We note that to mea-
sure the spectral line parameters, ARES requires the S/N for the
spectrum (or in this case, the S/N for each spectral order) to es-
timate the noise and place the continuum. The S/N at the center
of each order was extracted from the headers of the S2D spectra.
The mean (and the standard deviation around the mean) rela-
tive diﬀerence for EW, FWHM, and line depth calculated for all
the spectral lines is -1.4±3.6%, -2.3±3.1%, and 0.9±1.2%, re-
spectively. While these average diﬀerences are smaller than the
scatter around these values, the left panel of Fig. 5 shows a clear
dependence of ∆EW/EW and ∆FWHM/FWHM on the ∆ dis-
tance from order centers, suggesting that the measurements of
the line properties depend on the location of the lines relative to
the center of the order. Moreover, the fact that linear regression
ﬁts do not cross the zero points when the ∆ distance from order
centers is zero suggests that the asymmetry of the blaze function
plays a role.

Blazed gratings do not provide a constant eﬃciency over
wavelength. As a consequence of this eﬃciency distribution, the
S/N decreases at the order edges (Eversberg & Vollmann 2015).
Consequently, the spectral lines that appear in two adjacent or-
ders will be observed at diﬀerent S/N. This is best illustrated in
the right panel of Fig. 3, where the 5594.66 Å line is observed
at the same S/N in both orders, while the S/N at the 5584.77 Å
3 times (S/N goes with square root of ﬂux) higher
line is about
in the left order than in the right. Because in our line parameter
measurements with ARES we considered a single value (maxi-
mum value which corresponds to the center of the order) of S/N
for each spectral order the accuracy of the continuum placement
might decrease with the distance from the order center.

√

We decided to repeat the line measurements with ARES, but
varied the S/N for each line according to their distance from the
center of the order. The approximate S/N around each line was
calculated from the ﬂux (photon counts) at the nearby contin-
uum. The results of the test are shown in Fig. 6. It is apparent
that the trend with distance from the order center almost dis-
appeared. It is also important to note that the mean relative (and
absolute) diﬀerences and their standard deviations decreased sig-
niﬁcantly and became -0.7±1.8%, -1.7±2.0%, and 0.9±1.1% for
EW, FWHM, and line depth, respectively. This decrease is espe-
cially apparent for the absolute value of the diﬀerence obtained
for the EW, which changed from -0.8±1.9 to -0.3±0.7 mÅ.

Despite the improvement of the line parameter measure-
ments with variable S/N, Fig. 6 shows that an oﬀset still re-
mains (statistically insigniﬁcant, however) in FWHM and line
depth measurements for the lines measured in two adjacent or-

ders. In the top right panel of Fig. 7 we show a small spec-
tral region around 5588 Å in which we compare the normalized
spectra of two spectral orders. The inset plot shows the core of
the line, demonstrating that the line observed in the left (short
wavelength) order is deeper than in the right (long wavelength)
order. This is more clearly demonstrated in the middle right
panel, which shows the result of the division of the two nor-
malized spectra. The origin of this diﬀerence might be related
to the widths of the lines being slightly diﬀerent in the consec-
utive echelle orders. Because the spectral resolution within each
echelle order increases with wavelength (Pepe et al. 2020, sub-
mitted), the same line located in the overlapping region of two
adjacent orders will be observed at higher resolution in the short-
wavelength order when compared with the longer-wavelength
order 11.

The tests we performed in this section suggest that the spec-
tral lines measured automatically with ARES from diﬀerent
spectral orders can provide consistent results, well within the
uncertainties, if the S/N is correctly measured around each spec-
tral line. However, for some spectral lines, a diﬀerence of up to
∼4-5% in the EW can be observed. Figs. 5 and 6 suggest that
the largest diﬀerences are observed for the lines that are located
close to the boundary of the blue and red arms at ∼5250 Å.

3.3. S1D vs. S2D spectra

In this section we compare the spectral line parameters as mea-
sured from the S1D and S2D spectra. A 1D spectrum is the ﬁnal
product of ESPRESSO DRS, which is created by merging the re-
binned and blaze-corrected echelle orders and coadding the two
slices. In the left panels of Fig. 7 we show a small portion of the
S1D spectrum together with the two adjacent echelle orders from
the 2D spectra before (left top) and after (left bottom) correction
for the blaze function.

The line measurements for 2D spectra were made as in the
previous section by considering variable S/N depending on the
position of the spectral lines. For each spectral line, the average
values of the measurements from the two slices were taken. For
the line measurements from S1D spectra, we considered a diﬀer-
ent S/N for each spectral order as extracted from the headers of
the S1D ﬁts ﬁles. The results of our measurements are shown in
Fig. 8. Again the average values obtained for the ﬁve solar spec-
tra are shown. The outlier lines (at a 3σ level) were removed. For
the spectral lines observed in diﬀerent orders, the average values
are considered.

In general, we found relatively good agreement between the
line parameter measurements. The average relative diﬀerence
in EW, for example, is -0.6±0.8% and the absolute diﬀerence
is -0.19±0.22 mÅ. The relative diﬀerences in line parameters
further decrease for relatively strong lines with EW > 30 mÅ.
However, Fig. 8 shows that the discrepancy between the line
parameter measurements is larger for the lines that are posi-
tioned in multiple orders. In particular, the relative diﬀerence
in EW is larger by a factor of two for lines in multiple orders
(∆EW/EW = -1.1±1.1%) than for the lines observed in single
orders (∆EW/EW = -0.5±0.6%). A similar behavior is also ob-
served for the FWHM of the lines where ∆FWHM/FWHM in-
creases from -0.3±0.5% for single lines to -0.9±0.8% for multi-
ple lines.

11 Because of varying resolution and sampling in spectral orders, we
had to resample the two spectral orders to a common ﬁxed step size to
produce the middle right panel of Fig. 7.

Fig. 5. Relative (left panel) and absolute (right panel) diﬀerences of spectral line parameters measured in diﬀerent ESPRESSO
echelle orders as a function of wavelength, EW, and the distance from the center of the spectral order. The boundary wavelength
region (at ∼5250 Å) of the blue- and red-arm detectors is indicated by a gray rectangle. Line properties have been measured with
ARES with a ﬁxed S/N for each order. The linear regression of the data is shown as black lines.

Fig. 6. Same as Fig. 5, but for a S/N that varies as a function on the position of the spectral line in the echelle order. See the text for
details.

In Sect. 3.2 we proposed that becaue of the slight variation
in spectral resolution from the centers to the edges of spectral
orders, the widths of spectral lines appear diﬀerent in diﬀerent
spectral orders. In the top right panel of Fig. 7 we compare the
normalized spectra of two adjacent orders with the S1D spec-
trum for a small spectral region. The inset plot shows that the
depth of the line in the S1D spectrum is intermediate between
the lines observed in the two adjacent orders. The bottom right
panel shows the residuals of the division of the left (short wave-
length) 2D order by the 1D spectrum. These results suggest that
the observed diﬀerence in FWHM and EW for the lines mea-

sured from 1D and 2D spectra is probably related to the slight
variation in spectral resolution from the centers to the edges of
spectral orders.

Another interesting feature is visible in Fig. 8. There seems
to be an oﬀset in EW and FWHM diﬀerences between lines lo-
cated in the blue and red arms. In Fig. 9 we show the dependence
of ∆EW and ∆FWHM on wavelength, where the linear regres-
sion was performed for the lines located in the blue and red arms
separately. The plot shows that the oﬀset is visible both for lines
located in only single orders and lines located in multiple orders.
It is diﬃcult to identify the exact reason of this oﬀset. Because

Adibekyan et al.: Benchmark stars, benchmark spectrographs

Interestingly, 1D spectra single lines (lines that are located
in a single echelle order in the 2D spectra) show a slightly
worse agreement (-0.6±2.3%) with ATLAS measurements than
the lines that are located in multiple echelle orders in the 2D
spectra (-0.5±1.8%). The opposite trend is observed for the 2D
spectra where the agreement for the single lines is slightly better:
-1.2±2.5% vs -1.4±2.2%. These diﬀerences are not statistically
signiﬁcant and need to be taken only as indications.

The observational results that the measurements based on 1D
spectra are more accurate than those based on 2D spectra may
suggest that a single measurement of spectral lines from com-
bined spectra is preferable to averaging multiple measurements
of spectral lines from diﬀerent orders and slices. It is possi-
ble that when more sophisticated averaging techniques are used
(e.g., giving diﬀerent weights to line measurements based on the
S/N around the line or based on the distance from the center of
the echelle orders), the results will be improved for 2D spectra.
However, this might be only relevant for very speciﬁc science
cases where extremely high precision in line parameter measure-
ments is required.

3.4. Combined versus individual spectra

In this section we compare the atmospheric parameters and
abundances of several refractory elements derived from the com-
bined ESPRESSO spectra with those derived from the ﬁve in-
dividual ESPRESSO S1D spectra. The choice of the elements
was motivated by the choice of the EW method to determine
their composition, that is, elements whose abundances require
spectral synthesis or elements with lines that are signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by the hyperﬁne splitting were not considered. The ele-
ment abundances were derived as in Adibekyan et al. (2015a)
using the same tools and atmosphere model as for the deter-
mination of the stellar parameters. Our results are presented in
Table A.2 and are shown in Fig. 12. The ﬁgure shows [X/Fe]
abundance ratios relative to the mean <[X/Fe]> . The [X/Fe]
instead of [X/H] is preferred to compensate for the slightly dif-
ferent metallicities we obtained for each spectrum.

The table shows that the stellar parameters derived from the
combined and individual spectra agree in very well. It might
come as a surprise that the estimated uncertainties for the stellar
parameters did not decrease for the combined spectra. However,
we should note that the precision and accuracy of the stellar pa-
rameters depend not only on the quality of the spectra, but also
on several other factors such as atomic data of the spectral lines
and atmosphere models. When a diﬀerential spectroscopic anal-
ysis is performed, that is, when the atmospheric parameters of a
star relative to another star are determined, the eﬀect of the latter
factors is reduced, which gives the greatest weight to the qual-
ity of the spectra (Saﬀe et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2020). However,
in our analysis we are interested in comparing the parameters
and abundances determined from each spectrum individually.
Additionally, when UHR spectra are combined, the process of
combining (because of rebinning, e.g.) individual spectra also
plays a role. Nevertheless, our results show that the determina-
tion of solar atmospheric parameters from the diﬀerent spectra
is robust at the level of ∼10 K for Teﬀ, ∼0.03 dex for log g, and
∼0.01 dex for [Fe/H].

Fig. 12 shows that the abundances of the elements also agree
very well for the diﬀerent spectra. The ﬁgure shows that the
error bars for the elements (Na i, Mg i, and Al i) with fewer
than four spectral lines are signiﬁcantly larger for the individual
ESPRESSO spectra than the results obtained with the combined
spectra. The main reason for this is that the methods of esti-

S1D spectrum with the normalized S2D adjacent orders for a
small spectral region in which the two orders overlap. The inset

of the optical-design and manufacturing parameters, the spectral
resolution at the red end of the blue arm is diﬀerent from the
resolution at the blue end of the red arm (Pepe et al. 2020, sub-
mitted). Our interpretation is that the observed trend is a result
of the combination of the aforementioned diﬀerence in spectral
resolution between the two arms, slight dependence of the ∆EW
and ∆FWHM on EW (right panel of Fig. 8), and the complex de-
pendence of EW on wavelength (see Fig. 10). Fig. 10 shows that
the average EW of the spectral lines at the reddest end of the
blue arm is larger than that of the shortest wavelength spectral
lines of the red arm.

Although the observed diﬀerence in EWs as measured from
2D and 1D spectra is smaller than ∼1%, it is worth trying to
understand which measurements are more accurate and there-
fore preferable. Sousa et al. (2008) measured EWs of about 300
iron lines manually (using the IRAF12 “splot” routine) from the
Kurucz solar atlas (Kurucz 2005)13. Assuming these measure-
ments are accurate, we compared our EW measurements from
1D and 2D spectra with these reference values. Our comparison
(Fig. 11) suggests better agreement for the measurements per-
formed on the 1D spectra (-0.6±2.2%) than on the 2D spectra
(-1.2±2.4%). For both measurements based on the 1D and 2D
spectra the disagreement with the solar atlas observations seems
to increase for the lines that are located farthest from the cen-
ter of the echelle orders, although the trend is statistically not
signiﬁcant (F statistics suggest a p-value of 0.2 that the slope is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, a probability that is too high to
provide conﬁdence on the ﬁt).

mating the EW measurement uncertainties are diﬀerent for lines
with fewer or more than four spectral lines (see Adibekyan et al.
2016, for details). For the elements with more than three spectral
lines (Si i, Ca i, Ti i, Ti ii, Cr i, and Ni i in our study), the line-to-
line abundance scatter is used as an EW measurement error. For
elements with three or fewer spectral lines (Na i, Mg i, and Al i in
our study) the errors on EWs were calculated following Cayrel

(1988). These uncertainties take the statistical photometric error
due to the noise in each pixel (as we discussed in Sect. C) and the
error related to the continuum placement into account, which is
the dominant contribution to the error (Cayrel 1988; Bertran de
Lis et al. 2015). The larger error for the individual ESPRESSO
spectra arises from the dependence of the uncertainty estimation
by the formula on the S/N. Given the very good agreement in the
abundance determination for Na i, Mg i, and Al i (top three pan-
els of Fig. 12) based on diﬀerent spectra, the EW measurement
uncertainties might be overestimated.

“Gaia benchmark stars and other M-K standards”15. As men-
tioned on the PEPSI webpage, the spectra were reduced with
SDS4PEPSI Version 1.0, and its future releases may change the
resulting spectra, in particular, the continuum setting of the very
blue part. This should not be a problem for our analysis because
ARES performs a local continuum normalization for each spec-
tral line. Moreover, the spectral lines we used start at a wave-
length of ∼4500 Å, that is, farther away by about 700 Å from the
blue wavelength limit of the PEPSI spectra. Because the avail-
able PEPSI spectra are already normalized, it is not possible to
estimate the S/N from the ﬂux. We therefore let ARES automat-
ically determine and ﬁx the S/N (at around 6000 Å) for the spec-
tra and place the continuum accordingly (see Sousa et al. 2015a,
for more details about ARES).

Fig. 13 shows the relative diﬀerences between the line pa-
rameter measurements from the ESPRESSO spectra and those of
PEPSI and HARPS. As in the previous sections, the outlier mea-
surements at the level of 3σ were removed from the analysis. We
plotted these diﬀerences as a function of the average FWHM of
the spectral lines (measured from ESPRESSO spectra) because
the eﬀect of spectral resolution on line measurements should de-
pend on the intrinsic broadening of the lines. In addition to the
average width of the lines, the relative diﬀerence will also de-
pend on other characteristics of the spectral lines such as on the
average strength of the spectral lines.

The bottom panel of the ﬁgure clearly shows that the lines
appear deeper in ESPRESSO spectra than in PEPSI and HARPS.
As expected, these diﬀerences are more pronounced for stars

In this section we compare the line parameters and resulting stel-
lar parameters of the 11 stars for which we have ESPRESSO,
PEPSI, and HARPS spectra. We measured the lines on the com-
bined 1D spectra (more than one spectrum was available for
most of the stars). Reduced S1D HARPS spectra were taken
from the ESO Phase 3 archive14. The science-ready normal-
ized 1D PEPSI spectra were taken from the PEPSI archive of

with intrinsically narrow spectral lines (small FWHM). For τ
Cet, the slowest rotating star (Table A.1), the average relative
diﬀerence in line depth when ESPRESSO is compared with
PEPSI and HARPS is ∼3±1.5% and ∼8±2%, respectively. For
the fastest rotating star, this diﬀerence decreases to about 1%
when ESPRESSO is compared with PEPSI, and to about 2%
when ESPRESSO is compared with HARPS.

Because of the diﬀerent spectral resolution of ESPRESSO,
PEPSI, and HARPS (∼220 000, ∼220 000, and ∼115 000, re-
spectively), and because the vsin i and other stellar broaden-
ing mechanisms are comparable to the resolution element of the
spectrograph measured, the FWHM as measured on each spec-
trographs is expected to scale with resolution. However, it should
be noted that the spectral samplings of the two spectrographs
are diﬀerent: 2.5 pixels and 2 pixels per resolution element for
ESPRESSO and PEPSI, respectively. Additionally, the spectral
resolution of the two spectrographs changes within the end of
the echelle orders in diﬀerent nonlinear ways Strassmeier et al.
(2018b, ; Pepe et al. 2020, submitted). Finally, on further in-
vestigation, it was recently found that the PEPSI spectra of the
brightest stars (e.g., the Sun) used for comparison (taken before
2019) and available online were obtained with exposures times
of about a few seconds. For these exposure times, CCD con-
troler and shutter issues led to the ﬂashing of white light on the
detector, leading to shallower lines. These issues were solved
for recently acquired spectra, and a new dataset, corrected for
this eﬀect, will soon be released to the community (Strassmeier
2020, priv. comm).

Fig. 14 shows a comparison of the ESPRESSO, PEPSI,
and HARPS spectra of the Sun and Arcturus for a small spec-
tral window. For comparison, the Kurucz solar atlas (spectral
resolution of about 500 000) from Kurucz (2005) and the Kitt
Peak National Observatory (KPNO) Arcturus atlas (spectral res-
olution of about 150 000) from Hinkle et al. (2000) are also
shown. The plot shows an almost perfect match for the contin-
uum between the diﬀerent spectra. It also clearly shows (espe-
cially for the strongest lines) that the lines are indeed deeper
in ESPRESSO spectra than in PEPSI and HARPS. As expected
from its highest spectral resoling power, the deepest lines for the
Sun are observed in the Kurucz atlas.

The top panels of Fig. 13 show the diﬀerence in EWs
and FWHM of the lines as measured with ARES from the
ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectra. Because ARES as-
sumes a Gaussian proﬁle of the spectral lines when the ﬁt is
made, and because of the diﬀerences in line depths outlined in
the previous sections, we expect to see (on average) higher val-
ues of the FWHM for the lines observed in HARPS and PEPSI
spectra when compared to the ESPRESSO ones. The spectral
lines that appear deeper in ESPRESSO spectra are also narrower.
The maximum diﬀerence, observed for the slowest rotating star,
is ∼9±2% and ∼2±1% between ESPRESSO and HARPS, and
between ESPRESSO and PEPSI, respectively.

While we see diﬀerences in the spectral line proﬁles (width
and depth) measured from the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS
spectra, the middle panel of Fig. 13 shows that the EWs of the
lines are practically conserved. In general, it can be assumed
that for a conceptual spectrograph, the EWs of spectral lines are
conserved and in particular are not a function of resolution (as
long as the line is unblended). The average EW of the lines mea-
sured from the spectra of these spectrographs are indistinguish-
able within the error bars. The only exception is Arcturus, for
which the diﬀerence is slightly above 1σ (∼-1.6±1.1% between
ESPRESSO and HARPS, and ∼1.0±0.8% between ESPRESSO

10

and PEPSI). This makes the diﬀerence between PEPSI and
HARPS EW measurements signiﬁcant at a level of about 3σ.

We tested whether the observed diﬀerences in the line pa-
rameters between the spectrographs show a systematic depen-
dence on wavelength or distance from the center of the echelle
order (as measured in ESPRESSO 2D spectra). We found a
small but statistically signiﬁcant dependence of ∆FWHM be-
tween ESPRESSO and HARPS on wavelength. This might be
explained by a larger variation of the spectral resolution of
ESPRESSO over the wavelength range than that of the HARPS
spectrograph.

As in the previous section, we used these EW measure-
ments to determine the stellar parameters of the sample stars
and estimate the eﬀect of the observed diﬀerences. Fig. 15
shows the stellar parameters of the stars as a function of the
average FWHM of the spectral lines. The presented parameters
are relative to the reference values as presented in Jofr´e et al.
(2014) and Heiter et al. (2015). Except for the signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences from the reference values, our parameters derived from the
ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectra agree well. The largest
diﬀerence in stellar parameters observed between the spectro-
graphs is as follows: ∆Teﬀ of 82±70 K for Arcturus (between
PEPSI and HARPS); ∆log g of 0.256±0.138 dex for (cid:15) Eri (be-
tween ESPRESSO and HARPS); and ∆[Fe/H] of 0.052±0.044
for (cid:15) Vir (between PEPSI and HARPS). In general, the spec-
troscopic results obtained with ESPRESSO and PEPSI agree
slightly better than with those obtained with HARPS.

It is beyond the scope of this manuscript to discuss the pos-
sible reasons for the observed deviation of these spectroscopic
stellar parameters from the benchmark reference values in de-
tail, and we refer to Jofr´e et al. (2014) and Heiter et al. (2015).
However, we recall that the reference values for Teﬀ and log g
are not spectroscopic, but obtained with other fundamental, less
model-dependent methods. The only star for which our spectro-
scopic [Fe/H] deviates from the (spectroscopic) reference value
by more than one sigma is Procyon. However, this is expected
because of the observed diﬀerence in Teﬀ and log g for this star.

5. Summary and conclusion

We performed an intensive observational campaign with the
main goal of creating a homogeneous UHR spectral library for
all the Gaia benchmark stars and a catalog of homogeneously de-
rived stellar parameters and chemical abundances of these stars.
We obtained UHR ESPRESSO spectra for 30 out of the 34 FGK
benchmark stars. The remaining 4 stars are not observable from
the Paranal observatory, where the ESPRESSO spectrograph is
installed. Fortunately, UHR spectra for these 4 stars (in addition
to 19 more benchmark stars) have been obtained with the PEPSI
spectrograph. Now the question that follows is “Can PEPSI and
ESPRESSO go well together?” If for most of human beings it is
just a matter of taste, for us it is a matter of testing.

We compared the spectroscopic data obtained with
ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectrographs. ESPRESSO
and PESPI observations have been conducted at a spectral reso-
lution of about ∼220 000, and the resolution of HARPS spectra is
R∼115 000. For our analysis we considered 11 Gaia benchmark
stars with 4200 < Teﬀ < 6600 K, 1.5 < log g < 4.7 dex, -0.9 <
[Fe/H] < 0.25 dex, and vsin i < 10 km/s. The spectral lines (line
depth, line width, and EW) were measured with the ARES v2
(Sousa et al. 2015a) automatic code.

In the ﬁrst part of the manuscript we used the Vesta-reﬂected
ﬁve solar spectra obtained with ESPRESSO to estimate the eﬀect
of using diﬀerent reduction products on the measurements of

the spectral lines. Bellow we brieﬂy present the main results in
itemized form.

– Spectral lines observed in multiple echelle orders. Our re-
sults suggest that on average, the EWs of spectral lines mea-
sured from diﬀerent spectral orders agree well. However, we
found an oﬀset between the FWHM and depths of the spec-
tral lines as measured in adjacent orders. We interpret this
as a consequence of the variation in spectral resolution with
wavelength for each echelle order.

– Spectral lines measured from the S1D and S2D spectra.
By measuring the EWs of spectral lines from the 1D and
2D spectra, we found an average diﬀerence of ∼0.6% with
a scatter that is slightly larger than the oﬀset. The observed
oﬀset is larger for spectral lines that were observed in mul-
tiple orders (these lines are usually located farther from the
center of the spectral order) than for lines that are located in
only a single order. Our comparison of these measurements
with the manual EW measurements of Sousa et al. (2008)
based on the solar Kurucz atlas suggests a better agreement
for the 1D spectra. This result may mean that a single mea-
surement of spectral lines from combined (after combining
the echelle orders and two slices) 1D spectra is preferable
to simply averaging multiple measurements of spectral lines
from diﬀerent orders and slices in 2D spectra.

– Spectrum-to-spectrum scatter. We compared the line pa-
rameters measured from ﬁve individual 1D spectra and found
that the measurements agreed very well. The average scatter
in EW is 0.35±0.15 mÅ, which is very close to the aver-
age statistical photometric error for EWs estimated (Cayrel
1988) for the quality of the used spectra.

– Solar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances.
Using the EW measurements of the lines from the ﬁve S1D
spectra, we determined the stellar parameters and chemical
abundances of a few refractory elements. Our results show

an excellent agreement between the parameter and abun-
dance determinations. A scatter of only 9 K for Teﬀ, 0.01
dex for log g, and 0.005 dex for [Fe/H] is measured. The ob-
served scatter of the chemical abundances ranged from 0.002
dex (for Ti ii) to 0.01 dex (for Al i and Ca i). The observed
spectrum-to-spectrum abundance scatter for elements with
only a few lines (equal to or fewer than three) is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the uncertainty based on the propagation of the
EW errors, which takes into account the statistical photomet-
ric error and the error related to the continuum placement
(Cayrel 1988).

– Individual versus combined spectra. Our comparison
of the solar atmospheric parameters and chemical abun-
dances determined from the combined and individual S1D
ESPRESSO spectra showed very consistent results. We also
note that the uncertainties in the parameters and abundances
(for the elements with several available spectral lines) do
not decrease for the combined ESPRESSO spectrum when
compared with those based on the individual, lower S/N
ESPRESSO spectra. This result suggests that below given
values, the precision is mostly dominated by the uncertain-
ties in the atomic data of spectral lines, uncertainties in the
model of atmospheres, our assumption of a Gaussian proﬁle
for the spectral lines, and/or the process of combining the
individual spectra. However, it is important to note that for
elements with only one or two weak lines, the increase in
S/N is very important (see, e.g., Adibekyan et al. 2016, for
the case of oxygen lines).

In the second part of the paper we compared the spectro-
scopic results based on the measurements performed on the 1D
combined ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectra. Below we
itemized the main results.

– ESPRESSO – PEPSI – HARPS: spectral line measure-
ments. The comparison of the EW measurements based
on the spectra of these three spectrographs showed a good
agreement. The average relative diﬀerence in EW varied
from 0.03±0.5% (for β Gem, between ESPRESSO and
PEPSI) to 1.7±1.7% (for HD22879 between ESPRESSO and
PEPSI). While the EWs seems to be conserved when line pa-
rameter measurements are made, our results show that the
lines appear deeper in ESPRESSO spectra than in PEPSI
and HARPS. The largest diﬀerence in line depth between
ESPRESSO and PEPSI is about 3% and about 9% when
ESPRESSO is compared with HARPS. The largest diﬀer-
ences, as expected, are observed for the stars with intrinsi-
cally narrow spectral lines where the eﬀect of the spectral
resolution is more apparent. While the observed diﬀerence
between ESPRESSO and HARPS is expected because of the
diﬀerence in spectral resolutions, the discrepancy between
ESPRESSO and PEPSI results is still to be understood.
– ESPRESSO – PEPSI – HARPS: stellar parameters. The
good agreement in EW measurements between the diﬀerent
spectra resulted in consistent stellar parameters. The diﬀer-
ences range from 2 to 82 K in Teﬀ, from 0.002 to 0.256 dex
in log g, and from 0.004 to 0.052 dex in [Fe/H].

Summarizing our

results, we can conclude that

the
ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectrographs can deliver
spectroscopic results that are suﬃciently consistent for most of
the sciences cases in stellar spectroscopy. However, we found
small diﬀerences in the performance of the three spectrographs
that can be important for speciﬁc science cases, for instance,

12

when ultrahigh precision in chemical abundances based on lim-
ited weak lines is required, or when accurate line proﬁle ﬁtting
is required. At this stage, a proper accounting for 3D eﬀects and
deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium will be cru-
cial to obtain reliable and accurate abudnances (e.g., Bergemann
et al. 2012; Amarsi et al. 2016). These will be the subject of our
next works based on the full ESPRESSO sample.

Appendix A: Additional tables

Appendix B: Two slices of ESPRESSO S2D spectra

As mentioned in Sect. 3, two simultaneously observed 2D spec-
tra are obtained with the pupil slicer. In this section we compare
the spectral line parameters as measured from the two slices of
the S2D spectra. The line measurements were performed as in
the previous section, considering a variable S/N as a function
of the position of the spectral lines. The results of our measure-
ments are shown in Fig. B.1. As in the plots of the previous sec-
tion, the average values obtained for the ﬁve solar spectra are
shown. The outlier lines (at a 3σ level) were removed. For the
spectral lines observed in diﬀerent orders, the mean values are
considered.

The left panel of Fig. B.1 shows that the line parameter mea-
surements from the two slices are consistent within a few per-
cent. No trend can be seen in the ﬁgure, except for the fact that
the relative diﬀerence in EW measurements increases for weak

lines. This is expected because the absolute diﬀerences in EWs
are nearly constant; they are ∆EW = 0.05±0.44 mÅ.

In the previously discussed plot we did not separate the
spectral lines observed in only single orders from the lines ob-
served in multiple orders because we found no diﬀerence be-
tween the two groups: 0.1±1.0% vs 0.1±1.1% for EW, 0.1±1.2%
vs 0.1±1.2% for FWHM, and 0.2±0.8% vs 0.2±0.9% for line
depth. While we found practically no diﬀerence in EWs of the
lines as measured from the two slices and relatively small scatter
of 0.44 mÅ for ∆EW, we decided to perform additional tests to
understand which fraction of this scatter comes from our method
of measurements of the lines and which fraction is due to the lim-
ited S/N of the spectra (slices). We compared the EWs as mea-
sured from the two slices for each of the ﬁve solar spectra. The
average diﬀerence was nearly zero for all the cases, and the scat-
ter ranged from 0.74 mÅ (for the poorest S/N spectrum) to 0.98
mÅ (for the highest quality spectrum). Following Cayrel (1988),
we calculated the average statistical photonic error for the line
EWs. This error estimate is the theoretical lower limit because it
does not take various sources of error into consideration, such as
continuum placement. The Cayrel formulae suggest an average
error of 0.41 mÅ (to be compared with 0.74 mÅ) for the spectra
with the highest S/N and an error of 0.63 mÅ (to be compared
with 0.98 mÅ) for the lowest S/N solar spectrum. This simple
comparison shows that ARES measurements of the EWs of the
spectral lines on average are commensurate with the statistical
photonic errors in EWs expected for the S/N of the spectra.

Appendix C: Spectrum-to-spectrum scatter

The next test we performed for the ﬁve UHR solar spectra was
to compare the line parameters as measured from these ﬁve S1D
spectra. As in the previous sections, we discarded 3σ outlier
lines, that is, lines for which the spectrum-to-spectrum scatter
for a given line parameter is at least three times larger than the
average of spectrum-to-spectrum scatter for all the lines. The re-
sults of our measurements are shown in Fig. C.1. The plot shows
no diﬀerence between lines located (in 2D spectra) in single and
multiple orders.

In general, the line measurements are highly consistent. The
average relative scatter for EW is 1.1±0.8% and increases only to
about 4% for the weakest lines with EW < 10 mÅ. The absolute
scatter for the EW is 0.35±0.15 mÅ, which is very close to the
average error of 0.3 mÅ in EW estimated by the Cayrel (1988)
formulae for our spectra.

The next logical step in our study is to estimate the eﬀect
of the spectrum-to-spectrum, non-astrophysical variations of the
line parameters on the stellar parameter determinations. We de-
termined the atmospheric parameters of the Sun from the ﬁve
individual S1D spectra following Sousa et al. (2015b). In brief,
we used the EWs of the FeI and FeII lines and searched for
the ionization and excitation equilibrium in our spectral anal-
ysis. We used the grid of Kurucz model atmospheres (Kurucz
1993) and the 2014 version of the radiative transfer code MOOG
(Sneden 1973). We refer to Sousa (2014) for more details about
the method.

The results are presented in Table A.2. The parameter de-
terminations agree excellently well in general. In particular, the
observed spectrum-to-spectrum scatter for Teﬀ is ∼9 K, while
the average error is ∼11 K, for log g the scatter is ∼0.01 dex with
an average error of ∼0.02 dex, for Vtur the scatter is ∼0.02 km/s
with an average error of ∼0.02 km/s, and ﬁnally, for the [Fe/H]
the observed scatter is ∼0.005 dex, while the average error is

∼0.009 dex. This result also suggest that the procedure we used
to determine the uncertainties (internal precision) is consistent
and robust.

Because our iron line-list is composed of a large number of
single and multiple lines, it gives us a good opportunity to test
whether the two sets of lines deliver statistically discrepant abun-
dances. In Fig. C.2 we show how the abundances of individual
lines deviate from the mean iron abundance as a function of their
EW, wavelength, and distance from the center of the spectral or-
der. For each line, the average abundance derived from the ﬁve
solar S1D spectra is considered. The ﬁgure does not show any
particular trend for lines observed in single or multiple orders.
The average diﬀerence between the abundances derived from

14

these two sets of lines is ∼0.001±0.015 dex. The scatter around
the mean is slightly smaller for the multiple lines (∼0.010 dex)
than for the single lines (∼0.012 dex).

In Fig. C.3 we show the spectrum-to-spectrum abundance
scatter for each iron line. The mean scatter for single and multi-
ple lines is very similar: 0.010±0.004 dex and 0.009±0.004 dex,
respectively. The mean scatter for all the lines is 0.009±0.004
dex, which can be considered as the translation of the average
spectrum-to-spectrum EW scatter of 0.35±0.16 mÅ into iron
abundances.
