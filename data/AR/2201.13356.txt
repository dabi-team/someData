Abstract 

Iron- and steelmaking cause ~7% of the global CO2 emissions, due to the use of carbon for the 
reduction  of  iron  ores.  Replacing  carbon  by  hydrogen  as  the  reductant  offers  a  pathway  to 
massively  reduce  these  emissions.  However,  the  production  of  hydrogen  using  renewable 
energy  will  remain  as  one  of  the  bottlenecks  at  least  during  the  next  two  decades,  because 
making  the  gigantic  annual  crude  steel  production  of  1.8  billion  tons  sustainable  requires  a 
minimum  stoichiometric  amount  of  ~97  million  tons  of  green  hydrogen  per  year.  Another 
fundamental aspect to make ironmaking sector more sustainable lies in an optimal utilization 
of green hydrogen and energy, thus reducing efforts for costly in-process hydrogen recycling. 
We therefore demonstrate here how the efficiency in hydrogen and energy consumption during 
iron ore reduction can be dramatically improved by the knowledge-based combination of two 
technologies: partially reducing the ore at low temperature via solid-state direct reduction (DR) 
to  a kinetically defined degree, and subsequently melting and completely transforming it to 
iron under a reducing plasma (i.e. via hydrogen plasma reduction, HPR). Results suggest that 
an optimal transition  point  between these two technologies occurs where  their efficiency in 
hydrogen utilization is equal. We found that the reduction of hematite through magnetite into 
wüstite via DR is clean and efficient, but it gets sluggish and inefficient when iron forms at the 
outermost layers of the iron ore pellets. Conversely, HPR starts violent and unstable with arc 
delocalization, but proceeds smoothly and efficiently when processing semi-reduced oxides. 
We performed hybrid reduction experiments by partially reducing hematite pellets via DR at 
700°C to 38% global reduction (using a standard thermogravimetry system) and subsequently 
transferring them to HPR, conducted with a lean gas mixture of Ar-10%H2 in an arc-melting 
furnace, to achieve fully conversion into liquid iron. This hybrid approach allows to exploit the 
specific  characteristics  and  kinetically  favourable  regimes  of  both  technologies,  while 
simultaneously showing the potential to keep the consumption of energy and hydrogen low and 
improve both, process stability and furnace longevity by limiting its overexposure to plasma 
radiation. 

Keywords:  green  steel;  hybrid  hydrogen-based  reduction  of  iron  ores;  efficiency  in  H2 

consumption; process stability.

1. Introduction 

The urgent mission for decarbonisation has put the steel industry at the crossroads of a 

critical transition from fossil-based to hydrogen-based iron production [1–3]. This is because, 

currently, more than 70% of the global iron production is conducted through the blast furnace 

(BF) and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) integrated route, which generates the staggering amount 

of approximately 1.9 tons CO2 per each ton of produced steel due to the use of carbon-carrying 

substances as reducing agents. Such a number makes the iron- and steelmaking responsible for 

about 7% of all CO2 emissions on the planet, yet with a projection for a further massive increase 

for the coming decades [4,5]. Therefore, replacing carbon by green hydrogen (i.e. produced via 

renewable energy sources) as the reducing agent offers a promising pathway for cleaner and 

sustainable iron production, as the associated by-product is water rather than CO2. 

 From the plethora of possible technological approaches to produce iron using hydrogen 

as  a  reducing  agent,  three  have  been  identified  as  most  viable  for  widespread  industrial 

application: one is the direct injection of hydrogen into existing blast furnaces, in addition to 

coke (Figure 1a) [6–8]; the second one is the direct reduction (DR) conducted in shaft furnaces 

or  fluidized  bed  reactors,  where  the  solid  iron  ore  is  exposed  to  hydrogen-containing  gases 

(Figure 1b) [9–11]; the third one is the hydrogen plasma-based reduction (HPR), in which the 

ores  get  melted  and  reduced  simultaneously  (Figure  1c)  [12–14].  The  first  option  has  the 

highest technology-readiness level; however, it still requires coke as energy supply and porous 

solid  support  to  permit  gas  percolation,  and  thus  can  only  serve  as  a  short-term  transition 

technology  of  limited  effectiveness.  DR  performed  with  reformed  natural  gases  is  a  well-

established route (e.g. the MIDREX process) , but operation with molecular hydrogen has been 

proven to be feasible as well [9,10,15]. Independent on the reducing agent used, though, DR 

provides  solid  sponge iron, which has  to  be  subsequently  melted, typically by  conventional 

plasma  in  an  electric  arc  furnace  (EAF)  to  provide  the  liquid  iron  for  alloy  adjustment  and 

2 

 
 
casting [16], Figure 1 (d). The HPR process on the other hand is much more thermodynamically 

efficient  as  it  allows  for  simultaneous  reduction  and  melting  of  the  ores  as  well  as  for  the 

addition  of  scrap  into  the  same  aggregate  [12,17,18],  but  it  is  still  in  its  exploratory  stage. 

However, many technical aspects required in reducing hydrogen plasma reactors are already 

standard technology in existing EAFs. For example, the operational and controlling conditions 

of electric/plasma arcs in EAFs are standard industrial practices as well as magnetics stirring 

of the molten baths [19]. When operated under a DC current mode, EAFs can be set with one 

single electrode, namely cathode, enabling the bottom of the furnace to serve as the anode, i.e. 

similar to the setup employed in HPR where the plasma arc is ignited between the tip of the 

electrode  and  the  material  to  be  processed  (Figure  1c).  Such  configuration  enables 

simultaneous melting and stirring of the charged material, as it exploits the heat from the DC 

current passing through the melt and the associated produced magnetic fields [19]. Electrode 

and crucible design, protective slags formation for lining preservation, and water-based cooling 

systems are transferable knowledge from industrial EAFs to hydrogen plasma reactors [20]. 

Thus, it is conceivable that slight adjustments of existing EAF technology for such hydrogen-

based plasma-reduction purposes would require only comparatively modest investments, a key 

aspect for decision making in this industry at its current crossroads.  

One  essential  task  for  making  steel  production  not  only  sustainable  but  also 

commercially viable lies in the most efficient use of the costly reducing agent (green) hydrogen 

[21–23]. This is because of its direct link to the total energy balance which also includes the 

associated efforts for its in-process recycling and reutilization, as non-consumed H2, steaming 

from  the  outflux  streams,  can  be  reintroduced  back  to  the  processes  provided  it  is  properly 

purified  [15,24,25].  Driven  by  this  goal,  we  monitored  the  reduction  kinetics  of  iron  ores 

processed under individual DR and HPR routes along with their corresponding efficiency in 

hydrogen  utilization.  We  found  that  an  optimal  transitioning  point  between  these  two 

3 

 
 
technologies occurs at the reduction stage where their efficiency in hydrogen utilization has a 

cross-over point. These  findings suggest  that  the  goal  for  an  efficient  usage of hydrogen  in 

sustainable iron production (with minimum quantitates being sent to recycling) can be reached 

when combining DR and HPR into a novel hybrid process, where iron oxides partially reduced 

via a DR process to a kinetically defined degree is fed into a reducing plasma reactor to reach 

full conversion into liquid iron (Figure 1d). 

Our  findings  demonstrate  that  this  hybrid  process  not  only  occurs  without 

compromising the total process time (as the iron sponge coming from DR must be subsequently 

melted anyway) but also keeps both, the usage of hydrogen and consumption of energy low, 

by exploiting the process efficiency limits of both DR and HPR. The reason for this synergy 

lies in the underlying physics of the reduction kinetics. The first reduction steps in hydrogen-

based DR, from hematite through magnetite into wüstite, are very fast [26–29]. In contrast, the 

final reduction of wüstite into iron is very slow, endothermic, and requires a higher chemical 

potential of hydrogen. The thermodynamic requirements for wüstite reduction thus impose a 

utilization limit for hydrogen, causing additional efforts for its in-process recycling [30]. This 

means that DR starts efficiently (reducing hematite to wüstite), but gets slow and inefficient in 

the last stages of the reduction into iron [27,30,31]. The hydrogen-containing plasma on the 

other hand is violent and potentially unstable at the beginning of the reduction process,  but 

becomes much smoother when the ore has started to liquefy. Thus, under well-controlled arc 

conditions, HPR can proceed more efficiently with using semi-reduced oxides. Also, limiting 

the exposure of the furnace to a reducing plasma substantially enhances its lifespan, particularly 

regarding refractory linings and electrodes [20,32]. 

Scientific results reported here help identify and understand the most kinetically and 

energetically  favourable  regimes  of  individual  lab-scale  hydrogen-based  DR  and  HPR 

processes. A comprehensive evaluation of the associated underlying mechanisms that drive the 

4 

 
 
reduction reactions yet enables the combination of these regimes into a hybrid and efficient 

strategy for iron production with low impurity contents. With this work, we aim to open a new 

perspective for decision making steps in green steel production towards the optimization of the 

main boundary conditions in this field. They include a reflected green hydrogen exploitation, 

permitting also its optimized recycling, as well as a minimum total energy consumption, and 

robust and stable processing conditions (e.g. plasma arc stability) at minimum investment and 

maintenance costs (e.g. by limiting inner furnace linings to overexposure to plasma). Otherwise 

the  risk  exists  that  non-sustainable  hydrogen  and  inefficient  energy  usage  will  sweep  the 

market,  shifting  greenhouse  gas  emissions  simply  from  one  industry  to  another,  without 

enhancing industry’s overall sustainability.

2. Experimental 

2.1 Material 

In this work, commercial hematite in the form of both, pellets (average diameter of 8 

mm) and irregular pieces (average size of 1.5 mm) were used. The chemical composition of 

the pellets is 28.2 wt.% O, 0.52 wt.% Si, 0.11 wt.% Mn, 0.18 wt.% Al, 0.50 wt.% Ca, 0.37 

wt.%  Mg,  0.11  wt.%  Ti  and  traces  of  P,  S,  Na,  K  (with  Fe  as  balance).  The  chemical 

composition of the irregular pieces is 29.4 wt.% O, 0.10 wt.% Si, 0.01 wt.% Mn, 0.08 wt.% 

Al,  0.13  wt.%  S  and  traces  of  Ca,  Mg,  Ti  (with  Fe  as  balance).  The  content  of  metals  was 

evaluated  via  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectrometry  (ICP-OES).  The 

oxygen content was evaluated via reduction fusion under a helium atmosphere and subsequent 

infrared absorption spectroscopy. Sulphur was evaluated via combustion followed by infrared 

absorption spectroscopy. 

2.2 Solid-state direct reduction 

Hematite  pellets  were  isothermally  reduced  into  sponge  iron  in  the  static  bed  of  a 

standard thermogravimetry apparatus at temperatures of 700 and 900oC under an H2 flow of 

0.5 L/min [33]. The static bed is connected to a thermal balance and encapsulated by a quartz 

glass tube, which is surrounded by a cylindrical-shaped infrared furnace. Figure 2 (a) shows a 

schematic representation of the thermogravimetry system in which the furnace is drawn in its 

open position. Before annealing, a constant H2 flow of 0.5 L/min was set to percolate at room 

temperature  through  the  quartz  glass  tube  containing  the  material  to  be  processed.  This 

procedure was kept for  1 h in order to  remove any traces of gaseous substances (especially 

oxygen  and  water).  Subsequently  to  this  cleaning  procedure,  isothermal  annealing  was 

conducted for 2 h at 700 and 900°C respectively. The changes in weight of the pellets were 

continuously tracked over the course of the reduction processes by the thermal balance. These 

7 

 
 
values were further used to calculate the reduction degree as well the amount of H2 effectively 

consumed, as reported in Section S.1 in the Supplementary Material. The pellets were cooled 

down to room temperature inside the furnace. Further details of this procedure can be found in 

a preceding study [30]. 

Figure 2. (a) Schematic representation of the thermogravimetry apparatus used for hydrogen-

based solid-state direct reduction of iron ores [33]. The output stream is mostly composed of 

non-consumed  H2  and  the  by-product  water  vapour  (b)  schematic  representation  of  the  arc 

melting furnace equipped with a tungsten electrode and flooded with an Ar-10%H2 gas mixture 

used for hydrogen plasma-based reduction of iron ores. The output stream is a complex mixture 

of non-consumed H2, water vapour and gangue impurities evaporated from the ore [12]. 

2.3 Hydrogen-plasma reduction of molten iron ore 

Hematite  pieces  with  an  average  weight  of  15  g  were  introduced  in  an  arc-melting 

furnace equipped with a 6 mm-diameter tungsten electrode, Figure 2 (b). The furnace chamber 

(18  L)  was  charged  with  an  Ar-10%H2  mixture  (total  pressure  of  900  mbar).  Simultaneous 

melting and reduction of the samples were achieved by igniting an arc plasma between the tip 

8 

 
 
 
 
of the electrode and the input iron oxide at a voltage of 44 V and a current of 800 A (Figure 

2b). To achieve different intermediate levels of reduction, hematite pieces were submitted to a 

series of melting, solidification and remelting cycles up to 15 times. The corresponding plasma 

exposure  was  1  min  for  each  cycle  where  complete  melting  was  achieved  with  only  6  s  of 

exposure to hydrogen plasma. Samples were reduced during 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min. Proper 

reducing  atmosphere  conditions  to  maintain  the  progressing  reaction  were  ensured  by 

replenishing the furnace chamber with fresh Ar-10%H2 after the completion of every single 

melting and solidification cycle.  Further details of the experimental apparatus  and reducing 

conditions are reported in a preceding study [12]. 

The solidified samples were hammered in order to separate the mm-sized iron portion 

from the remaining unreduced oxide one. The latter was further powdered and subjected to X-

ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a diffractometer D8 Advance A25-X1 (cobalt Kα 

X-ray source), operated at 35 kV and 40 mA. The weight fraction of the phases contained in 

the powder was determined via Rietveld refinement. The weight  fractions of the iron oxide 

variants (mainly wüstite) were reported in a preceding study [12]. Here, these values were used 

to calculate the corresponding amount of oxygen in all samples. 

To  evaluate  the  thermal  decomposition  of  hematite  and  sort  out  the  corresponding 

amount  of  oxygen  that  actually  reacts  with  hydrogen  and  the  one  that  is  evaporated  due  to 

vapour pressure, 15 g of hematite pieces were processed in the arc-melting furnace under a 

pure argon atmosphere using the same process conditions described above (i.e. 44 V, 800 A, 

total pressure of 900 mbar, up to 15 min process). The furnace chamber was also replenished 

with  fresh  argon  after  the  completion  of  every  single  melting  cycle.  Samples  were  also 

hammered  into  powder  and  characterized  via  XRD  measurements  according  to  the  above-

mentioned protocol. The corresponding amounts of consumed hydrogen were determined via 

mass balance calculation, as reported in Section S.1 in the Supplementary Material.

2.4 Hybrid reduction 

Hematite pellets were partially reduced via DR (Figure 2a) to 38% reduction at 700oC 

(this process step is hereafter named as “DR to crossover”, Section 3.3) under an H2 flow rate 

of  0.5  L/min.  In  this  work,  the  kinetically  defined  reduction  degree  of  38%,  conducted  at 

700°C, was chosen as the “crossover point” for the hybrid reduction route (Section 3.3). Four 

38%-partially reduced pellets obtained via DR (whose total weight was approximately 15 g) 

were transferred to a hydrogen reducing plasma (Ar-10%H2) using the reactor schematically 

shown in Figure 2 (b) and processed according to the methodology described in Section 2.3 

(this second step is hereafter named as “HPR after crossover”). The semi-reduced pellets were 

further reduced through HPR at different intermediate stages with exposure times to hydrogen 

plasma varying from 1 to 10 min. Supplementary Figure 3 shows the weight fractions of iron 

and wüstite for these samples, obtained using the same protocol described in Section 2.3. The 

corresponding weight fraction of wüstite was used to calculate the amount of oxygen in each 

sample. 

2.5 Microstructural characterization 

Representative samples processed via the hybrid reduction route (Section 2.4) were cut, 

embedded and metallographically prepared for high-resolution scanning electron microscopy 

analysis using a Zeiss Merlin scanning electron microscope (SEM). Energy-dispersive X-ray 

spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were also conducted for this sample at an accelerating voltage of 

15 kV.

3. Results 

3.1 Reduction kinetics of direct reduction versus hydrogen plasma reduction 

Figure  3  (a)  shows  the  solid-state  DR  kinetics  of  hematite  pellets  exposed  to  pure 

molecular hydrogen at 700 and 900 ºC under a constant gas flow of 0.5 L/min, as performed in 

a preceding study [30]. This  figure also  displays the corresponding kinetics for  HPR of the 

molten iron ore, conducted with a small H2 partial pressure of 10% (viz. Ar-10%H2). Figure 3 

(a) also reveals that the total conversion of hematite into liquid iron is achieved after 15 min of 

exposure to hydrogen plasma, whereas sponge iron is produced in the DR route within ~70 and 

~40 min direct exposure of hematite to H2 at 700 and 900°C, respectively.  

The reduction rates for both DR and HPR are shown in Figure 3 (b). In this figure, the 

vertical dashed line at 33% reduction (i.e. 33 wt.% oxygen loss) corresponds to the theoretical 

reduction  degree  at  which  hematite  is  expected  to  be  completely  transformed  into  wüstite 

(through  magnetite)  during  DR,  i.e.  33%  reduction  represents  the  onset  of  the  solid-state 

wüstite reduction regime [30]. However, hematite pellets, when exposed to a reducing gas, get 

heterogeneously reduced, with substantial gradients through their thickness [27,30,34]. This 

means that, at a 33% global reduction degree, iron forms preferentially at the outermost layers 

of the pellets or ore pieces, whereas their core remains partially reduced into magnetite and 

wüstite, as reported in a preceding study [30].   

Figure 3 (b) also shows that the transformations beyond 33% reduction exhibit reaction 

rates of almost one order of magnitude lower than those observed at the earlier reduction stages, 

independently of the process employed. In the solid-state DR scenario, such sluggish kinetics 

is mainly associated with slow nucleation rates of iron domains within the oxide pellets as well 

as to  sluggish  mass transport of outbound  oxygen through the outer dense iron layer of the 

pellets  [30,31].  The  use  of  HPR  that  simultaneously  melts  and  reduces  the  ore,  however, 

enables to proceed approximately two times faster from 33% reduction onwards, as shown in 

11 

 
Figure 3 (b). This is because within the high-current plasma, high densities of highly energetic 

hydrogen-originated  radicals  are  being  created,  including  protons  as  the  most  reactive 

[13,17,35]. As they are accelerated towards the molten ore, their energy is partially transferred 

to the reaction interface, enabling local heat releasing and thus self-supplying energy to the 

reduction reaction [12,13].

kinetics  of  molten  iron  ore  performed  via  HPR  using  a  lean  Ar-10%H2  gas  mixture.  (b) 

Reduction rates of both, DR and HPR as a function of the reduction degree. The vertical dashed 

line at 0.33 reduction represents the theoretical onset of the wüstite reduction regime during 

DR. 

3.2 Process stability and thermal decomposition during hydrogen plasma reduction  

The plasma arc stability was qualitatively evaluated at different stages of the HPR route, 

as shown in Figure 4 (a). At the early beginning of the process, especially when the iron ore is 

not  yet  completely  melted,  the  arc  is  potentially  unstable  and  gets  scattered,  as  revealed  in 

Figure 4 (a1). Conversely, the arc becomes well-controlled and smoother when the material 

gets melted and the reduction proceeds further past the hematite to magnetite transition (Figure 

4 a2). This might be one of the possible reasons why reduction kinetics drastically vary at the 

12 

 
 
 
beginning of the HPR process (i.e. in the early 20% reduction stage), as shown in Figures 3 (b) 

and (c). Figure 4 (a3) shows an image of the specimen fully converted into a molten iron pool. 

Figure 4. (a) Analysis of the arc plasma stability during HPR recorded at distinct reductions 

stages of the process. (b) Thermal decomposition of hematite during argon plasma processing. 

(c) Deconvolution of the competing partial chemical reactions during HPR: chemical changes 

due  to  thermal  instability  of  hematite  before  melting,  and  the  reduction  associated  with  the 

redox reaction between oxygen of the ore and hydrogen plasma species. 

 Oxygen loss of hematite due to thermal decomposition was monitored under the same 

process  conditions  adopted  in  HPR,  but  using  an  argon  atmosphere  inside  the  arc-melting 

furnace rather than a gas mixture of Ar-10%H2 (Section 2.3). The oxygen loss due to vapor 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
pressure  is  reported  in  Figure  4  (b).  This  figure  shows  that  over  15  min  exposure  to  argon 

plasma, hematite reduces to a mixture of magnetite plus wüstite with a global oxygen content 

of  approximately  25  wt.%,  which  translates  into  ~14  wt.%  global  reduction.  These  results 

evidence that the reduction degree achieved at each intermediate stage via HPR (as documented 

in  Figure  3)  is  associated  with  two  competing  partial  chemical  reactions,  namely,  chemical 

changes linked to thermal instability of the ore before melting, and the reduction that is actually 

attributed to the redox reaction between oxygen of the ore and hydrogen plasma species, as 

reported in Figure 4 (c).  

3.3 Efficiency analysis 

The process efficiency of H2 utilization during lab-scale DR and HPR was calculated 

by the ratio between the amount of H2 effectively consumed by the reaction, which was derived 

from  the  kinetic  data  displayed  in  Figure  3  (a)  for  DR  and  Figure  4  (c)  for  HPR  (i.e.  after 

subtracting  the  thermal  decomposition  effects),  and  the  hydrogen  provided  to  the  furnace 

(Section S.1 in the Supplementary Material). The efficiencies in H2 utilization for both, DR 

and HPR follow the trends represented by the burgundy line and blue dashed line in Figure 5, 

respectively. Considering reduction solely via DR, the highest efficiencies are observed during 

the initial stages of the process, where hematite pellets become partially but quickly reduced 

as the hydrogen has surface access to the reaction front, as schematically shown in Figure 5. 

The efficiency of a full HPR route abruptly changes from 60% to nearly zero during the early 

20% reduction stage (i.e. within the initial 2 min of the process where the arc tends to delocalize 

and  where  the  reduction  kinetics  drastically  vary,  as  shown  in  Figure  3).  However,  the 

efficiency  increases  again  from  33%  reduction  onwards,  displaying  values  between  20  and 

40%. Figure 3 reveals that there is an optimal crossover point for these two technologies where 

their efficiencies in H2 utilization are the same. These observations encouraged us to combine 

14 

 
 
the best features of these two routes into a hybrid process to realize the most efficient use of 

hydrogen, as indicated by the green line in Figure 5. 

Figure 5. Overall trend of the efficiency in hydrogen consumption during a pure DR process 

(represented  by  the  burgundy  line),  a  pure  HPR  (blue  dashed  line)  approach,  and  the 

corresponding one for a hybrid reduction (green line). For a hybrid scenario, hematite pellets 

are partially reduced to an optimal crossover point via DR, as schematically represented in the 

upper part of this figure. After the crossover point, the partially reduced pellets are transferred 

to an EAF with a reducing hydrogen plasma to complete the conversion into liquid iron. 

Figure 6 (a) shows the efficiency plots for the pure DR, conducted at 700 and 900ºC, 

respectively,  together  with  the  corresponding  one  for  the  pure  HPR.  Opportunities  for  a 

crossover between the two processes occur at 38 and 60% reduction, respectively, when the 

direct reduction step is conducted at 700 and 900ºC. These results suggest that decreasing the 

temperature of the DR step allows its interruption at earlier reduction stages before transferring 

the  material  to  the  reducing  plasma,  thus  enabling  to  reduce  thermal  energy  consumption 

15 

 
 
 
 
already in the DR step (it is worth to recall in that context that hydrogen-based direct reduction 

is endothermic). 

The  total  amount  of  hydrogen  circulated  through  the  thermogravimetry  system  to 

produce  sponge  iron  via  a  pure  DR  route  is  reported  in  Figure  6  (b)  together  with  the 

corresponding  H2  quantities  required  in  both  steps  of  a  hybrid  process,  namely  “DR  to 

crossover” and “HPR after crossover” (the latter using the arc-melting furnace). This figure 

shows that a hybrid process requires considerably less hydrogen (a total of 10.5 moles H2/mol 

hematite  to  be  flooded  into  the  furnace)  when  compared  with  a  pure  lab-scale  DR  route 

performed at 700 or 900oC. However, the highest potential for saving hydrogen circulation is 

achieved by a hybrid process in which the “DR to crossover” step is conducted at 700oC up to 

38% reduction. In this case, the amount of hydrogen employed to reach the crossover point is 

only 4.3 moles per mol of hematite. The subsequent “HPR after crossover” step requires only 

an additional amount of 6.1 moles H2 /mol hematite, instead of 22.7 moles H2 /mol hematite 

that would be necessary to fully convert the pellets into sponge iron at 700oC in the solely lab-

scale DR route. Thus, in the hybrid scenario, six times less hydrogen is circulated through the 

system  during  the  corresponding  employed  DR  step.  This  observation  also  suggests  that  a 

hybrid  procedure  enables  less  amounts  of  hydrogen  to  be  recycled  from  the  off-gas  stream 

before being reintroduced to the process (as reported in Supplementary Figure 2).

(burgundy  line)  and  900oC  (gold  line)  under  a  constant  H2  flow  rate  of  0.5  L/min.  The 

corresponding H2 efficiency during HPR is represented by the blue pentagon symbols. (b) Total 

amount of hydrogen employed to produce sponge iron via a pure DR route at 700 and 900oC,

processes, namely “DR to crossover” and “HPR after crossover”. 

3.4 Validation of the hybrid reduction concept 

Based on the findings reported in Figure 4, we performed hybrid reduction experiments 

in which the “DR to crossover” step was conducted at 700oC to reach a reduction degree of 

38%. Figure 7 (a) shows the reduction kinetics for the corresponding hybrid reduction route. 

The data reveal that both steps, namely “DR to crossover” and “HPR after crossover”, require 

10 min each. Figure 7 (b) reveals that the use of HPR after the crossover point enhances the 

reaction rates by about one order magnitude in comparison with the rates observed during the 

17 

 
 
 
second half of the DR step (within the interval between 20 and 38% reduction). Figure 7 (c) 

summarises the total process time and the total amount of hydrogen employed in the hybrid 

reduction route proposed in this work. For the sake of comparison, this figure also shows the 

corresponding process time and H2 quantities used in the stand-alone DR (conducted at 700 

and 900oC) and HPR routes. Figure 7 (c) suggests that the hybrid reduction investigated here 

enables a total hydrogen consumption similar to that employed in a pure HPR scenario, which 

is considerably lower than those quantities required to produce sponge iron via DR.  

Figure 7 (c) also shows that the total process time of the hybrid approach is 20 min, a 

value that is 5 min longer than the total time required to produce iron  solely via pure HPR. 

However, Figure 7 (b) shows that the “HPR after crossover” step of the hybrid approach is only 

10 min, and not 15 min as in the case of a pure HPR.

Figures 8 (a) and (b) display images of hematite subjected to different steps of a hybrid 

reduction  process.  Figure  8  (a)  shows  one  hematite  pellet  before  and  after  partial  direct 

reduction to 38% at 700oC. Four 38%-partially reduced pellets were transferred to HPR and 

processed for 1 and 10 min, achieving ~ 50 and ~ 100% reduction, respectively (Figure 8b). 

After solidification, these specimens were probed via microscopy at the regions indicated by 

the numbers 1 to 4 in Figure 8 (b). The major portion of iron produced after 1 min of HPR 

sinks to the bottom of the melt pool (region of the sample with bright contrast in Figure 8b), 

leaving  the  remaining  unreduced  oxide  on  the  top  of  the  sample  [12,18].  Microstructural 

characterization of this sample (Figure 8c), reveals that small iron dendrites are found dispersed 

within  the  remaining  wüstite  (frames  1  and  2  in  Figure  8e),  which  solidifies  with  a  typical 

dendritic structure. Iron obtained after 10 min of HPR contains a small volume fraction (~ 0.01) 

of Fe- and Si-bearing oxide particles that remained trapped within the solidified material, as 

revealed by the elemental distribution maps displayed in Figure 8 (d). These particles have also 

a tendency of floating atop of the melt pool (similar to a slag layer), as indicated by the arrow 

in Figure 8 (b), due to their lower density when compared with that of iron. Therefore, it is 

conceivable that they can be properly separated from the melt when adequate conditions for 

flotation are applied.

4. Discussion 

Hydrogen-based  iron  production  is  the  most  viable  option  to  drastically  reduce  the 

staggering CO2 emissions in this sector. In that context, the economical consumption of this 

reductant  is  of  the  highest  importance  for  sustainable  iron  production,  as  green  hydrogen 

produced by renewable energy sources will continue as one of the major bottleneck during the 

next decades [23,36,37]. The underlying reasons are the low electrolysis productivity and the 

insufficient  capacities in  both  renewable electricity  and industrial  infrastructures to  produce 

sufficient amounts of green hydrogen, especially in view of the gigantic demand for currently 

1.8 billion tons of steel being produced every year, with forecasts predicting 2.4 billion tons by 

the  year  2040  [38].  In  its  current  transient  technology  state,  hydrogen  comes  mainly  from 

reforming methane via steam (called grey hydrogen, or blue when it is combined with carbon 

capture and storage [23]). Therefore, highly efficient exploitation of hydrogen for carbon-free 

iron-making is crucial for the challenge of decarbonizing the steel industry [1], enabling also 

lesser efforts for hydrogen recycling and reutilization. 

The pure HPR route for green iron production would be an ideal scenario, where the 

ore is simultaneously melted and reduced. However, our results obtained in model laboratory-

scale processes suggest that significant technical adjustments for plasma arc stabilization at the 

beginning of the process (Figure 4 a1) are necessary in order to reduce process inefficiency 

with  respect  to  reduction  kinetics  (Figure  3),  electrical  energy  consumption  and  use  of 

hydrogen (Figure  6). An  important  processing  aspect  is  that the initial  arc ignition  is  rather 

violent  and  unstable,  causing  sputtering  of  solid  hematite  which  delays  the  progress  of  the 

reaction and can damage the electrodes. Prolonged exposure to an unstable arc and violent bath 

dynamics  can  also  cause  damage  to  the  inner  structure  of  the  reactors  (e.g.  the  refractory 

linings)  when  not  protected  by  purposely  developed  slags,  diminishing  their  lifespan  and 

requiring  additional  maintenance  costs  [32].  Conversely,  the  plasma  is  much  smoother  and 

21 

 
well-controlled  when  the  reaction  proceeds  from  33%  reduction  onwards,  permitting  better 

exploitation of hydrogen, as documented in Figure 6 (a). These factors concerning arc stability, 

slag development and efficient use of hydrogen are essential aspects for up-scaling of the HPR 

process. 

Considering that DR starts efficiently and fast during the first stages of the reduction 

and that sponge iron currently produced via industrial DR routes must be melted anyway in 

EAFs,  a  hybrid  strategy  involving  DR  and  HPR  allows  to  combine  the  advantages  of  both 

technologies: first reducing hematite to  a kinetically defined reduction level  with controlled 

and efficient DR, to later transfer the semi-reduced product to a plasma furnace enabling the 

enhancement of both kinetics and H2 utilization at simultaneously improved process stability. 

Our research results for the hybrid route provide promising insights on efficiency and kinetics 

in this direction. The total hybrid reduction time is only 5 min longer than that required in a 

pure hydrogen plasma reduction (Figure 7). However, we must consider that the exposure time 

to plasma in the hybrid route is shorter (i.e., only 10 min and not 15 min as in the case of a 

solely HPR, Figures 3 and 7), enabling a longer lifespan of the reactor linings and electrode 

materials. The total amount of hydrogen provided in the hybrid process is practically the same 

as  the  one  employed  in  an  ideal  pure  HPR  scenario,  i.e.  the  approach  of  bringing  partially 

reduced  pellets  or  lump  ores  into  a  reducing  plasma  environment  produces  liquid  iron  at 

minimal  hydrogen  utilization  yet  enabling  optimized  opportunities  for  its  recycling 

(Supplementary Figure 2). Recycling of H2 is another fundamental aspect in existing hydrogen-

based steel production, as it allows not only recovering costly H2 but also the associated thermal 

energy  [15,39].  As  reduction  of  iron  ores  conducted  solely  via  hydrogen-based  DR  is 

endothermic, an excess of hydrogen input is demanded to serve as heat carrier in shaft-furnaces 

and  maintain  the  productivity  rates  [40].  Typical  numbers  associated  with  the  MIDREX 

technology and other reports [41] are ~800 m3 of H2 per ton of produced sponge iron, of which 

22 

 
250 m3 are essentially required as fuel for gas heater. Energy recovery from H2 in condensers 

are  dependent  on  the  excess  of  hydrogen  flooded  in  shaft-furnaces  though,  as  recently 

documented  in  a  detailed  assessment  of  process  parameters  for  industrial  hydrogen-based 

reduction of iron ores. It was demonstrated that an oversupply of hydrogen above six times the 

quantity  required  to  produce  sponge  iron  hinders  heat  recovery  from  hydrogen  output  in 

condensers [15]. This means that additional energy supply must be given to the system to heat 

the input hydrogen. Results from our lab-sale hybrid route suggest that lower quantities of H2 

could be employed in the DR step, as the product is not sponge iron but a semi-reduced oxide 

processed  at  relatively  low  temperatures.  In  other  words,  DR  is  only  conducted  within  the 

hematite  through  magnetite  to  wüstite  reduction  regime,  avoiding  entering  the  wüstite 

reduction interval that thermodynamically requires higher chemical potentials of hydrogen to 

drive the kinetically sluggish reaction FeO + H2 → Fe + H2O. This implies that the residence 

time for the input material in a shaft furnace can be shortened, yet suggesting that reactors with 

more  compact  dimensions  could  be  designed  for  this  purpose.  When  processing  the  semi-

reduced material during the second step of the hybrid route, namely HPR, an efficient usage of 

H2 is also indispensable, as the off-gas is not only composed of non-consumed H2 and product 

water, but it also contains a broad variety of gangue elements (e.g. P, S, Si and others) that get 

evaporated from the ore due to  their high vapor  pressures [12]. Thus, additional efforts  are 

demanded for H2 purification before being reintroduced to the process if a non-optimized usage 

of H2 is conducted during the HPR step.  

Although  our  results  are  based  on  laboratory  experiments,  and  the  absolute  values 

reported  here  might  change  when  upscaled  to  large-scale  industrial  aggregates,  the  results 

suggest  that  a  viable  hybrid  strategy  for  the  green  steel  industry  can  be  applied,  based  on 

merging  the  best  features  of  DR  and  HPR  at  minimal  changes  to  existing  industry-scale 

23 

 
aggregates and workflows, with special emphasis on the efficient use of energy and hydrogen, 

both key bottlenecks in green steel making.  

24 

 
 
 
5. Summary and conclusions 

We  investigated  the  fundamental  and  process  aspects  of  a  hybrid  hydrogen-based 

reduction of iron ores. Based on lab-scale experiments, the maximum utilization and highest 

potential for H2 savings were achieved when hematite pellets were partially reduced to 38% at 

700°C with a H2 flow (namely, crossing over point), and subsequently converted into liquid 

iron under a hydrogen reducing plasma (Ar-10%H2).  

Results  also  suggested  that  this  hybrid  route  allows  to  exploit  the  best  kinetics 

reduction, energy and stability aspects in both DR and HPR steps. This is because on one hand 

the solid-state phase transformations that heterogeneously occur along the pellets length until 

reaching 38% global reduction (i.e. before the crossing over point) proceeds fast and efficient. 

On the other hand, the arc plasma proceeds much more stable when processing semi-reduced 

oxides (e.g. 38%-reduced pellets) in comparison with the scenario where hematite is used as 

input material. Our findings suggested that six times less hydrogen is consumed in the DR step 

of a hybrid process when compared with a pure lab-scale DR route conducted at 700°C. This 

suggests that the residence time in direct reduction furnaces can be shortened, as the product is 

not sponge iron but a semi-reduced oxide. Therefore, reactor with more compact dimensions 

could be designed for this purpose. These findings also suggest that less costly H2 can be sent 

to purification before being reintroduced to the process, a task that would require lesser efforts, 

energy and costs. Better utilization and recycling during HPR are also of great importance as 

non-consumed H2 present in the off-gas is mixed with water vapor, argon, and gangue elements 

evaporated from the ore, thus requiring additional efforts to its purification.  

With  this  work  we  aim  to  provide  a  decision-making  suggestion  for  sustainable 

ironmaking  in  order  to  avoid  energy  expenses  for  unnecessary  recirculation  of  H2  in  shaft 

furnaces  or  plasma  rectors,  yet  permitting  the  production  of  pure  iron  with  competitive 

conversion rates.
