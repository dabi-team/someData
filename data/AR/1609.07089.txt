One major background in direct searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) comes
from the deposition of radon progeny on detector surfaces. The most dangerous surface background
is the 206Pb recoils produced by 210Po decays. In this letter, we report the ﬁrst characterization
of this background in liquid argon. The scintillation signal of low energy Pb recoils is measured
to be highly quenched in argon, and we estimate that the 103 keV 206Pb recoil background will
produce a signal equal to that of a ∼5 keV (30 keV) electron recoil (40Ar recoil). In addition, we
demonstrate that this dangerous 210Po surface background can be suppressed, using pulse shape
discrimination methods, by a factor of ∼100 or higher, which can make argon dark matter detectors
near background-free and enhance their potential for discovery of medium- and high-mass WIMPs.
We also discuss the impact on other low background experiments.

Noble liquid detectors have demonstrated exceptional
sensitivity in direct searches for weakly interacting mas-
sive particles (WIMPs), a popular candidate for dark
matter. Over the past decade, xenon-based experiments
including XENON100 [1] and LUX [2] have achieved the
highest sensitivities in this ﬁeld. Recently, argon-based
experiments have also developed key technologies neces-
sary for sensitive WIMP searches, as demonstrated by
the DarkSide-50 experiment [3, 4]. The DEAP-3600 ex-
periment [5], which is being commissioned at SNOLAB,
is expected to achieve a higher dark matter sensitivity
than that of current xenon experiments, especially for
high-mass WIMPs. With the powerful pulse shape dis-
crimination (PSD) capability of argon, argon dark mat-
ter searches at multi-tonne scales can be free of electron
recoil backgrounds from solar neutrinos [6] and from ra-
dioactive decays of radon progeny and 85Kr [7], all of
which compromise the sensitivity of xenon experiments.
Due to the low expected interaction rate between
WIMP dark matter and ordinary matter, it is critical
for WIMP search experiments to achieve a very low back-
ground rate, especially for nuclear recoil background that
can mimic a WIMP interaction. One such nuclear recoil
background can result from the exposure of detector sur-
faces to radon that is naturally present in the environ-
ment, speciﬁcally in air and in ground water. Through
the following decay sequence,

222Rn → 218Po → 214Pb → 214Bi → 214Po
→ 210Pb → 210Bi → 210Po → 206Pb

210Po and other radon progeny can be produced and be-
come attached to detector surfaces. The decay of 210Po

The recoiling 206Pb nucleus can make a dangerous back-
ground if it is recorded in the active volume of the de-
tector. Unlike the short-lived nuclides in the early radon
chain, 206Pb could be produced many years after radon
exposure owing to the long half-life (∼22 years) of 210Pb.
206Pb recoils have been identiﬁed as one of the most
important backgrounds in several major dark matter ex-
periments, such as LUX [2], SuperCDMS [8, 9], Co-
GeNT [10], and CRESSTII [11]. For example, a sur-
face 210Po α-decay rate of ∼ 35 mHz was detected in
the LUX experiment [12], and 206Pb was the major re-
maining background observed in the WIMP search signal
region even after position cuts [2]. For argon-based dark
matter experiments like DarkSide-50 and DEAP-3600,
position sensitivity as accurate as that in xenon detectors
has not been achieved, which makes these experiments

has been considered the most dangerous background for
the DEAP-3600 experiment [13].

This paper presents a study of the surface 206Pb nu-
clear recoil background for argon dark matter experi-
ments. We will report the ﬁrst scintillation measurement
of low energy Pb recoils in liquid argon, and then charac-
terize the full surface background by taking into consid-
eration the signals induced by the α particles accompa-
nying the Pb recoils. Because argon experiments usually
use a wavelength shifter (WLS) coating on the interior
detector surfaces for the detection of vacuum ultraviolet
(VUV) argon scintillation light, the α particles can pro-
duce additional scintillation photons in the WLS. With
this scintillation signal, we demonstrate that this sur-
face background in argon dark matter experiments can
be signiﬁcantly suppressed. The impact of this research
on DarkSide-50, DEAP-3600 and other low-background
experiments will be discussed.

Although the 206Pb recoils from 210Po decays are pro-
duced at a relatively high energy (103 keV), most of the

energy is non-radiatively dissipated as heat and cannot
be detected in argon detectors. Due to the low detectable
energy and the lack of signal tagging methods, no char-
acterization of this 206Pb recoil signal has been reported.
In this work, we took an alternative approach, namely, to
investigate the 206Pb recoil signal by studying the 210Pb
recoils in the α decays of 214Po. 214Po can be produced
by the β decay of 214Bi in the 222Rn chain; the short half
life (∼164 µs) of 214Po means that the 214Bi and 214Po de-
cays will be in delayed coincidence, and this 214Bi-214Po
coincidence can be used to eﬃciently tag 214Po decays.

The slightly higher 210Pb recoil energy makes the direct
measurement more viable; at the same time, one does
not expect the scintillation eﬃciency of argon for 206Pb
recoils to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from that for 210Pb.

In this experiment, we ﬁrst collected 222Rn progeny
onto a VUV-reﬂective mirror (>85% reﬂectivity for ar-
gon scintillation light at 128 nm [14]) by exposing its re-
ﬂective side to a radon-argon gas mixture with a 222Rn
activity of ∼2 MBq [15]. The VUV mirror consists of a
highly reﬂective aluminum coating on a quartz substrate
and a 25±10 nm MgF2 protective layer to prevent the alu-
minum from oxidizing. During the exposure, the progeny
of 222Rn plated out on the VUV mirror and 214Pb quickly
accumlated due to its relatively long half life (27 min).
After about 3 hours, this VUV mirror was removed from
the radon collection chamber and deployed into a liquid
argon detector as illustrated in Fig. 1. The detector was
then pumped and purged for several cycles to remove
electronegative impurities, cooled down to 87 K with an
external liquid argon bath, and ﬁlled with puriﬁed argon
for scintillation measurements.

As 214Po decayed on the surface of the VUV mirror,
the daughter 210Pb nucleus could recoil into the liquid
argon and produce VUV argon scintillation light. Mean-
while, the accompanying α particle will lose its energy in
the mirror and not produce signiﬁcant light due to the
thinness of MgF2. The 210Pb light was eﬃciently col-
lected by a photomultiplier (PMT) through the use of the
VUV mirror and a WLS coating on the Spectralon reﬂec-
tor. Due to the 27 min lifetime of 214Pb, the 214Bi-214Po
coincidence rate became negligible within several hours
of the initial radon exposure. The whole measurement
therefore had to be completed within 6–8 hours. This
was achieved by the specially designed single-phase liq-
uid argon detector illustrated in Fig. 1.

The energy spectrum of the 214Po decay events, iden-
tiﬁed by the 214Bi-214Po coincidence, is shown in Fig. 2
(dotted blue). The energy scale is given by the number
of photoelectrons (p.e.) detected by the PMT, which is
proportional to the number of scintillation photons pro-
duced. Due to the presence of electronegative impurities
in the liquid argon, a small fraction of the triplet ar-
gon scintillation was lost; a correction for this eﬀect was
made based on the measured triplet scintillation lifetime

and singlet-to-triplet ratio. Two groups of events were
observed in the 214Po decays. The high energy events
around 20,000 p.e. were easily identiﬁed as α particles
and the low energy events below 100 p.e.
can be at-
tributed to 210Pb recoil nuclei. The rates of the two
event groups are approximately equal, which conﬁrmed
the explanation of their origins.

However, the 210Pb energy spectrum exhibited a broad
distribution with a high-energy cutoﬀ instead of a mono-
energetic peak. This could be explained by 214Po pre-
cursors recoiling into the surface and becoming embed-
ded beneath it. When these embedded 214Po nuclei de-
cayed the energy of the recoiling 210Pb nuclei would be
degraded by the time they reached the argon. The pulse
shape parameter Fprompt, deﬁned as the fraction of scin-
tillation within the ﬁrst 90 ns, also exhibited lower values
at lower energy for the embedded events, as shown in the
inset of Fig. 2. This trend is similar to that of 40Ar re-
coils measured by [16], but occurs at higher energies for
210Pb recoils. This behavior was qualitatively conﬁrmed
by SRIM simulations [17] that predict that 210Pb nuclei
lose most of their energy to recoils with argon nuclei,
which then scintillate. A single 210Pb nucleus recoiling

high fraction of the 210Pb energy to be dissipated as heat,
decreasing the Lindhard factor, and 2) a high argon dimer
decay rate through non-radiative channels, strengthening
the Birks saturation. The SRIM simulations, however,
under-predict the amount of quenching, possibly due to
Lindhard model breaking down for Pb recoils at low en-
ergies, as suggested in [19].

Assuming that the scintillation eﬃciency of liquid ar-
gon is the same for 210Pb recoils (146 keV), measured in
this work, and for 206Pb recoils (103 keV) produced by
210Po, the 206Pb surface background would produce only
a modest ∼5 keVee signal, similar to a ∼30 keV 40Ar
recoil. This background is below the energy threshold
of current argon dark matter experiments [3]. However,
since argon detectors usually use WLS coatings on the
inner detector surfaces, when a surface 206Pb nucleus
enters liquid argon, the α particle will enter the WLS
and produce additional scintillation light. This α signal
will contribute to the overall scintillation light, and make
the 206Pb recoils more likely to become a background in
argon-based dark matter experiments.

Therefore, we carried out a direct, in situ surface back-
ground measurement that combined scintillation signals
from both the Pb recoils and the accompanying α parti-
cles. The measurement used a similar technique to the
210Pb recoil experiment described earlier, but instead of
leaving the α particles undetected, we used a WLS coat-
ing to produce a scintillation signal upon α particle inci-
dence, as occurs for real surface backgrounds in argon de-
tectors. Again, we used 214Po decays to produce the sig-
nals and used the 214Bi-214Po coincidence method to tag
the surface 214Po events. In this study, two WLS chemi-
cals were investigated: tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB), the
most widely used WLS in argon dark matter experiments,
and 1,4-Diphenylbenzene (pTP, or p-Terphenyl). To en-
sure consistency in the comparison, we applied approxi-
mately the same coating thickness for both WLSs (∼0.3-
0.4 mg/cm2), which was chosen to match that used in
dark matter experiments.

The energy spectra of 214Po decay products, selected
with the 214Bi-214Po coincidence, are shown in Fig. 3. As
expected, two peaks are observed in each spectrum. The
higher energy peak contains the full energy α signals in
argon and the Pb recoils in the WLS. The lower energy
peak contains the 210Pb recoil signals in argon together
with the α-induced signals in the WLS. Due to the ad-
ditional WLS scintillation, the light output of the low
energy peak greatly increased in comparison to that in
Fig. 2. The diﬀerent amount of increase observed with
the two WLSs agrees well with studies of WLS scintilla-
tion properties under α excitation [15, 20–22]. Due to the
mix of argon scintillation and WLS scintillation in this
measurement, the argon scintillation loss due to impuri-
ties is not corrected, but the eﬀect on the overall energy
scale is estimated to be less than 5%.

The peak signals from the low energy surface back-
ground events were observed at 88 p.e. and 192 p.e. for
TPB and pTP, respectively. Both fall in the dark mat-

α events are observed around 20,000 p.e.. The inset ﬁgure

value, and a Gaussian ﬁt to the spectrum is also shown.

in argon will therefore produce a signal similar to that of
multiple lower energy argon nuclei recoiling, explaining
why Fprompt decreases at higher energies for 210Pb recoils
than it does for direct 40Ar recoils.

To calculate the argon scintillation light yield for full
energy 210Pb recoils (146 keV), we selected the 210Pb
events within the Fprompt range of 0.72 - 0.9, as shown
in the inset of Fig. 2. These 210Pb events were selected
because they exhibited Fprompt values above the most
probable value (0.72) and were only weakly aﬀected by
the embedded events. The resulting spectrum exhibited
a Gaussian peak, the peak position of which was found
at 41.2±0.6 p.e. using a χ2 ﬁt. The uncertainty resulting
from the Fprompt cut was evaluated by varying the cut
range. The data acquisition threshold in the measure-
ment was set to be ∼1.5 p.e., and the trigger eﬃciency
is expected to be 100% above the analysis threshold of
10 p.e. The full energy 210Pb light output was corrected
to 45.7±2.3 p.e. after considering the VUV reﬂectivity
of the aluminum mirror. A second measurement with a
non-VUV-reﬂective silver foil as the radon backing ma-
terial yielded consistent results after corrections.

Using the measured scintillation light yield of
6.2±0.2 p.e./keV for 59.5 keV 241Am γs, we can ob-
tain an electron-equivalent energy of 7.4±0.4 keVee for
the 146 keV 210Pb recoils. This result indicates a scin-
tillation quenching factor of 19.7±1.2 relative to gam-
mas/electrons and 6.2±0.5 relative to 40Ar nuclear re-
Simulations using the
coils, extrapolated from [18].
SRIM software [17] indicate that the stopping power of
210Pb recoils in liquid argon is ∼5 times higher than that
of 40Ar recoils. This high stopping power can cause 1) a

creasing the coating thickness, which will lower both the
central value and the spread of the Fprompt distribution
for the combined surface background events. Optimiza-
tion of the surface background rejection power for argon
dark matter experiments is beyond the scope of this pa-
per;
interested readers can ﬁnd more on this topic in
references [15] and [22].

We point out that the surface background suppres-
sion power presented here is conservative for two rea-
sons. First, we left out the correction for the loss of
argon triplet scintillation due to impurities, and such a
correction will lower the overall Fprompt values for the
surface background events. Second, the Fprompt value of
206Pb recoils will be lower than that of 210Pb due to the
lower recoil energy, especially for those embedded under
the detector surfaces. Both factors will increase the sep-
aration of the surface background from the nuclear recoil
values in Fprompt distributions and enable stronger back-
ground rejection. A full evaluation of the 210Po back-
ground in argon dark matter experiments requires ex-
trapolation from the measured 214Po results, but we ex-
pect the background suppression factor to be at the same
order of magnitude due to the relatively small contribu-
tion of the Pb recoils to this background.

Finally, we comment that this method of rejecting sur-
face backgrounds by detecting the α particles has po-
tential applications beyond argon-based dark matter ex-
periments. For example, coating the reﬂector surfaces
of xenon experiments with a thin layer of MgF2 or LiF,
which can produce signiﬁcant scintillation [23, 24] under
α excitations and which are transparent to xenon scin-
tillation light, can help reject surface backgrounds reject
surface backgrounds like those observed in LUX [12, 25].
For double-beta decay experiments like CUORE, the
dominant surface background arises from α particles with
partial energy deposition in the crystals [26].
Simi-
larly, the α particles may be detected with a thin coat-
ing of scintillating material on the surfaces of the crys-
tals/supporting structures, which would allow this back-
ground to be suppressed.

face events measured in argon, using TPB (∼0.4 mg/cm2) and
pTP (∼0.3 mg/cm2) as the WLS, respectively. The low en-

ter search window as used in DarkSide-50 [3, 4]. The fact
that this background has not been observed in DarkSide-
50 could be partially explained by the relatively low
statistics, and more importantly by the low ionization
collection eﬃciency on the detector surfaces, which cause
surface events to fail the analysis cuts, similar to that
observed in LUX [12]. Single phase argon dark matter
experiments like DEAP-3600, on the other hand, only
collect the scintillation signals and are therefore more
vulnerable to surface background contamination [13].

The surface background, however, can be suppressed
using the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method. The
inset of Fig. 3 shows the overall Fprompt distribution
of the low energy surface background events. Owing
to the relatively slow WLS scintillation under α exci-
tation [21, 22], the overall Fprompt distribution of surface
background events is strongly biased towards lower val-
ues than those of pure nuclear recoils in liquid argon.
Using the simple Fprompt PSD method, we estimate that
the surface background can be suppressed by a factor of
∼10 (100) for TPB (pTP) at 50% (90%) 40Ar recoil ac-
ceptance for coatings of the investigated thicknesses. Al-
though TPB exhibits a low background rejection power
using the simple Fprompt method, a newly discovered long
decay component in TPB under α excitation [21] could in
principle increase the PSD rejection to a factor of 100 or
better [22]. As for pTP, the rejection power against the
Pb recoil background can also be further improved by in-
