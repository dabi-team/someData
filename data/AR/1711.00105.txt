ABSTRACT
We present one-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative
transfer simulations (using CMFGEN) of two sub-Chandrasekhar (sub-MCh), one MCh and one
super-MCh Type Ia SN ejecta models. Three originate from MCh delayed detonation mod-
els, and the fourth is a sub-MCh detonation model. Ejecta masses are 1.02, 1.04, 1.40, and
1.70 M(cid:12), and all models have 0.62 M(cid:12) of 56Ni. Sub-MCh model light curves evolve faster,
reaching bolometric maximum 2–3 days earlier and having 3–4 days shorter bolometric half
light widths. The models vary by ∼12 per cent at maximum bolometric luminosity and by
0.17 mag in Bmax. While ∆M15(B) increases with ejecta mass it only varies by ∼5 per
cent around 1 mag. Sub-MCh models are 0.25 mag bluer in B − R at Bmax. Optical spectra
share many similarities, but lower mass models exhibit less UV line blanketing during the
photospheric phase. At nebular times, signiﬁcant NIR spectroscopic differences are seen. In
particular, emission lines of the Ca II NIR triplet; [S III] λλ9068,9530; [Ca II] λλ7291,7324;
[Ar III] λλ7135,7751; and [Ni II] 1.939 µm are stronger in higher mass models. The [Ni II]
1.939 µm line is absent in the sub-MCh detonation model, and provides a valuable potential
tool to distinguish sub-MCh explosions from MCh explosions. In general, the nebular phase
models are too highly ionized. We attribute this to the neglect of clumping and/or the distribu-
tion of intermediate mass and iron group elements. The two sub-MCh models, while exploded
by different mechanisms, can be distinguished in the J and H bands at late times (e.g., +200
days).

INTRODUCTION

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thought to be thermonuclear
runaway explosions of carbon-oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs (WDs)
(Hoyle & Fowler 1960), but the formation channel of the progen-
itor remains uncertain. Determining the progenitor channel(s) of
SNe Ia, and their diversity, is of crucial importance since it will im-
prove their use as probes of cosmological parameters (Riess et al.
1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). Further, understanding the progenitor
channel allows us to probe stellar evolution of binary systems prior
to the SN occurring, and hence place constraints on both binary
synthesis models and binary evolution.

There are two main progenitor channels invoked to explain the
origin of SNe Ia – the single degenerate (SD) channel and double
degenerate channel. In the “classic” SD channel, the WD accretes
matter (usually hydrogen and/or helium) from a non-degenerate
star due to binary interaction via Roche lobe overﬂow. However,
mass transfer in the SD channel is not limited to Roche lobe over-

ﬂow – it can also be mediated by wind mass loss as, for example, in
symbiotic systems (see Maoz et al. 2014, for a review). In the SD
channel matter accumulates on the white dwarf, where stable burn-
ing can occur, until the star approaches the Chandrasekhar mass
(MCh≈1.4 M(cid:12)) and explodes leading to a SN Ia (Whelan & Iben
1973; Nomoto 1982).

How the WD explodes has long been a matter of study within
the astrophysics community. The different explosion mechanisms
include pure detonation (Arnett 1969; Sim et al. 2010), pure de-
ﬂagration (Nomoto et al. 1976), delayed detonation and pulsating
delayed detonation (Khokhlov 1991a,b; Gamezo et al. 2005; Livne
et al. 2005; R¨opke & Niemeyer 2007; Jackson et al. 2010; Seiten-
zahl et al. 2013), and gravitationally-conﬁned detonation (GCD)
(Plewa et al. 2004). More recent research on the GCD, including
3D full star simulations, was presented by Seitenzahl et al. (2016).
For sub-MCh WD masses, a double detonation scenario has been
explored (Woosley & Weaver 1994; Livne & Arnett 1995; Fink
et al. 2007, 2010).

One of the most successful theories at reproducing the proper-
ties of standard SNe Ia is the delayed-detonation transition (DDT)
model where the WD ﬁrst undergoes a subsonic deﬂagration phase.

The resulting expansion of the WD creates lower density fuel,
which is necessary for the production of intermediate mass ele-
ments (IMEs). At a particular density, the burning switches from
subsonic to supersonic (Khokhlov 1991a,b). This scenario is re-
quired to recreate the observed chemical stratiﬁcation. Pure deto-
nation models produce too many iron group elements (IGEs) such
as iron and nickel but not enough IMEs at high velocities to repro-
duce SN Ia spectra. On the other hand, deﬂagration models pro-
duce abundant amounts of IMEs but not enough 56Ni to power the
SN luminosity. This mechanism is a possible channel for under-
luminous SNe Ia (Travaglio et al. 2004; Phillips et al. 2007; Jordan
et al. 2012; Kromer et al. 2013). One dimensional (1D) DDT mod-
els have been very successful in reproducing the observed proper-
ties of SNe Ia. However, these models describe the turbulent ﬂame
propagation only in a parametrized way. Three dimensional (3D)
models better capture the ﬂuid instabilities and mixing. This lead to
different ejecta structures that do not reproduce observables as well
as 1D models (see e.g. Seitenzahl et al. 2013; Sim et al. 2013b).

The double degenerate scenario corresponds to the merger of
two WDs through loss of angular momentum by gravitational wave
emission. It is not understood how the merger triggers the explo-
sion, although it is thought that during the merger the smaller mass
WD donates matter to the more massive WD. Recently, modeling
by Sato et al. (2015) has shown that, depending on the masses of
the two WDs, explosions can occur either during the merger phase,
provided both WDs are within a mass range between 0.9–1.1 M(cid:12),
or within the merger remnant phase when the more massive object
reaches MCh. From their models, the authors estimate that 9 per
cent of galactic SNe Ia can be attributed to mergers. One prob-
lem in this scenario is that rapid mass accretion of carbon and
oxygen leads to an off-centre carbon ignition and subsequently an
O/Ne/Mg WD (Saio & Nomoto 1985). Accretion induced collapse
creates additional problems for high accretion rates, leading to the
formation of a neutron star instead of a SN Ia. For an extensive
review about progenitors of SNe Ia, see Maoz et al. (2014).

When almost the entire C/O WD has burnt, releasing ∼1051
ergs (more energy than the gravitational binding energy of a MCh
WD), the energy liberated unbinds the WD, producing an ejecta
with no remnant. Ejecta velocities of the order of ∼10 000 km s−1
are produced, and within minutes, the ejecta reaches a homologous
coasting phase (radiation pressure from 56Ni decay produces sec-
ond order effects). At early times the ejecta is radiation dominated
and heated by the decay of 56Ni (56Co for post-maximum evolu-
tion). It is because of this main decay chain of 56Ni→56Co→56Fe,
with roughly 1.7 MeV of energy release per decay for 56Ni and
3.7 MeV per decay for 56Co, that these objects are so luminous.
However, Dessart et al. (2014a) show the importance of heating the
outer ((cid:62)20 000 km s−1) ejecta from other decay channels.

Early work by Stritzinger et al. (2006) suggested sub-MCh
WDs as progenitors for some SNe Ia based on comparisons of
U V OIR light curves of 16 SNe with analytical models of nuclear
decay luminosities and energy deposition. Scalzo et al. (2014a,b),
Sim et al. (2010, 2013a), and Blondin et al. (2017) have shown that
there is both observational and theoretical evidence for sub-MCh
explosions. From photometric model ﬁtting, Scalzo et al. (2014a,b)
shows that the mass distribution for SNe Ia includes both sub-MCh
and super-MCh events. Scalzo et al. (2014b) argue that 25–50 per
cent of SN Ia events deviate from MCh events, with most of these
occurring as sub-MCh explosions. Therefore, for given measured
56Ni masses, one can compare SNe Ia to better understand how
ejecta mass affects light curves and spectral evolution.

Sim et al. (2010, 2013a) found good agreement with photo-

metric observations at maximum and reproduced IME features in
synthetic spectra at maximum with 1D pure detonations of sub-
MCh explosions. However, these models decline too rapidly post
maximum. This idealized approach ignores the inﬂuence of any
accreted helium layer. Previous works (Woosley & Weaver 1994;
Livne & Arnett 1995; Hoeﬂich & Khokhlov 1996; Hoeﬂich et al.
1996; Nugent et al. 1997; Kromer et al. 2010) found difﬁculties re-
producing the observed light curves, colours and spectral evolution
after treating the burnt helium layer, which synthesizes a signiﬁcant
amount of 56Ni.

Woosley et al. (2007) explored a grid of SN Ia models com-
ing from 1.38 M(cid:12) WDs with varying amounts of mixing and
56Ni, ﬁnding models of similar 56Ni to have large variations of de-
cline rates (∆M15(B) – which is the change in B-band magnitude
15 days after B-band maximum (Phillips 1993)) and anti width-
luminosity relationships. Woosley & Kasen (2011) computed hy-
drodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of sub-MCh mass
models for helium-accreting WDs, but the authors only found rea-
sonable agreement with spectra and light curves of common SNe
Ia for the most massive white dwarfs with the smallest helium lay-
ers they considered. Blondin et al. (2017) looks at broadening our
understanding of the width-luminosity relation (WLR) using pure
detonations of sub-MCh WDs. Their work shows promising agree-
ment with observations of faint SNe Ia, conﬁrming the need for
two WD populations to explain the full behavior of the WLR seen
at high and low SN Ia brightnesses.

Observations have shown high-velocity features (HVFs) in
early-time spectra of SNe Ia. These features have been used to con-
strain the explosion scenario (Mazzali et al. 2005a,b; Tanaka et al.
2006; Blondin et al. 2013; Childress et al. 2013, 2014; Silverman
et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2015; Pan et al. 2015). Studying the forma-
tion of these features as well as their correlation with galaxy en-
vironment can improve our understanding of Type Ia progenitors.
We can gain insights, for example, into the density and temperature
structure of the outer layers. The latter will reveal itself through
changes in ionization and hence the strength of spectral features.

In this paper we study two sub-MCh models (∼1 M(cid:12)), a MCh
model (∼1.4 M(cid:12)), and a super-MCh model (∼1.7 M(cid:12)), all with the
same 56Ni mass by design, to determine the effects of ejecta mass.
One model is a standard DDT model, two models are standard
DDT models whose density have been scaled to give the desired
ejecta mass, while the ﬁnal model arises from a pure detonation
in a sub-MCh model. The original DDT models are also somewhat
artiﬁcial. For example, the onset of detonation in a DDT model is
a free parameter. Further, it is impossible in current models to re-
solve and adequately model the thermonuclear ﬂame (see Ciaraldi-
Schoolmann et al. (2013) and references therein). We consider evo-
lution over more than two hundred days in time – from ∼1 day after
the explosion until approximately 220 days after the explosion, and
look for diagnostics of ejecta mass (Mej) for our 56Ni mass that
can be used to distinguish between the different models. Since the
precise explosion mechanism is uncertain, the two sub-MCh mod-
els were exploded using different assumptions. Spectra and light
curves were computed using non-LTE and time-dependent radia-
tive transfer. Looking for SN Ia diagnostics, we wanted to remove
sensitivity of 56Ni while focusing on ejecta mass to uncover in-
sights in SN Ia evolution, both spectroscopically and photometri-
cally.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the
techniques used and initial ejecta properties. We compare the bolo-
metric light curves as well as synthetic photometric light curves in
Section 3. We discuss the spectral evolution, highlighting the strong

spectral differences, in Section 4. In Section 5, we further high-
light the distinctions between our two sub-MCh models. In Section
6.1 we comment on the lack of high velocity features. Section 6.2
shows spectral comparison to a few SNe Ia that are close in mea-
sured Mej and 56Ni mass. In Section 6.3 we discuss shortcomings
of our models in reproducing spectral characteristics of SNe Ia be-
yond 20 days post-maximum. Section 7 summarizes our results and
conclusions.

2 TECHNIQUE

To determine spectral and light curve diagnostics we utilize hydro-
dynamical models that have been evolved from explosion until 0.75
days. Homologous expansion of the ejecta is well established at 100
seconds, and it is assumed to strictly hold at all times thereafter.
We allow for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) and
solve the spherically symmetric, time-dependent, relativistic radia-
tive transfer equation in order to produce emergent synthetic spec-
tra from which synthetic light curves (LCs) can be produced.

2.1 Ejecta and Radiative Transfer Modeling

Our models correspond to scaled ejecta of model DDC0 (density
scaled by 0.73, model SUB2) and DDC15 (density scaled by 1.22,
model SUP), complemented with models DDC10 (no scaling ap-
plied, model CHAN) – see Blondin et al. (2013) – and SCH5p5
(density scaled by 0.98, model SUB1) – see Blondin et al. (2017).
This density scaling is applied to produce ejecta with the same 56Ni
mass initially (0.62 M(cid:12)), but differing in ejecta mass so that they
lie below, at, and above the MCh. This scaling, applied exclusively
to the density at 10 seconds after explosion, is obviously artiﬁcial.
An advantage of this scaling method is that, while the mass varies,
the chemical stratiﬁcation does not. This ensures the models re-
tain their fundamental characteristic of all SN Ia ejecta. We do not
compute the combustion nor make any claim that a ﬂame would
behave in the way adopted for the corresponding WD mass (i.e.,
deﬂagration followed by detonation in the DDC models; pure det-
onation in the SCH model). Even in the original (unscaled) model,
the treatment of combustion is largely imposed rather than com-
puted from ﬁrst principles. The purpose of the study is to investi-
gate the signatures sensitive to variations in ejecta mass, keeping
the 56Ni mass the same between all models in order to retain only
one variable quantity. Model masses, kinetic energies, and impor-
tant species masses are summarized in Table 1.

The use of scaled DDT models for SUB2 and SUP is prob-
lematical since the explosion properties will depend on the mass
of the WD. For example, differences in the initial central densities
before the explosion will likely lead to different abundance pro-
ﬁles within the ejecta. In particular, sub-MCh WDs, unlike their
MCh counterpart with stable IGEs in their inner ejecta, do not ex-
hibit a ‘56Ni hole’ which is a low 56Ni abundance inside an expan-
sion velocity of 2500 km s−1. However, a comparison of SUB2
with SUB1 will allow us to test the sensitivity of the results to
the adopted explosion model. The explosion mechanism for ejecta
with super-Chandrasekhar masses is extremely uncertain, and any
adopted model will have limitations.

The radiative transfer models have been computed using CM-
FGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998; Hillier & Dessart 2012; Dessart et al.
2014a,b), which solves the spherically symmetric, non-local ther-
modynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), time-dependent, relativistic ra-
diative transfer equation in the co-moving frame. To advance in

locity. The cumulative mass begins to ﬂatten off around 25 000 km s−1 for
all models, the velocity at which the density begins to decrease rapidly. Less
than 1 per cent of the total mass is exterior to this velocity.

time, we used a 10 per cent time step for each model starting from
0.75 days until ∼100 days, after which we used a time step of 10
days. At early times (∼<7 days) during the time sequence, we as-
sumed that γ-ray photons created from radioactive decays are lo-
cally deposited. Otherwise, we approximate the γ-ray deposition
as grey, adopting the procedure from Swartz et al. (1995) and a
κγ = 0.06Ye cm2 g−1. The kinetic energy of decay positrons is
locally deposited at all epochs. CMFGEN currently treats both one-
and two-step decay chains for calculating non-thermal heating.

2.2 Ejecta Conditions for Radiative Transfer

Table 1 shows the yields for the most abundant species in our ejecta
models at 0.75 days. Since the 56Ni mass is ﬁxed, there are sub-
stantial variations in the mass of the IMEs. In particular, the mass
of individual IMEs in model SUP is a factor of 3 to 5 larger than in
model SUB2; model SUB1 has ∼1.3 to 1.4 times the mass of IMEs
and ∼1/3 times the iron mass of SUB2. The initial iron abundance
in SUB1 is almost a factor of 6 lower than in SUP. The mass of
stable nickel (58Ni and 60Ni) is 0.011, 0.026, 0.025, and 0.030 M(cid:12)
for SUB1, SUB2, CHAN, and SUP. The presence of stable nickel
features in nebular spectra, and the ability to measure the nickel
abundance, is discussed in Sections 4 and 6.3.

In Fig. 1 we show the outward cumulative mass as a function
of velocity. Less than 1 per cent of the mass lies beyond 25 000
km s−1 for all models, and hence we restrict future model ejecta
comparisons to velocities less than 30 000 km s−1. Higher velocity
material makes very minor contributions to synthetic spectra.

Fig. 2 compares the initial mass fraction at 0.75 days for all
models. All but model SUB1 exhibit an ‘56Ni hole’ at velocities
less than ∼2500 km s−1. As noted earlier, the hole in SUB2 is ar-

3 LIGHT CURVES

The light curves and colour evolution of Type Ia models depends on
the progenitor system, and potentially offer a means to distinguish
between progenitor systems. Due to differences in ejecta mass, the
diffusion time varies between models, giving rise to morpholog-
ical separations in both the width of each bolometric light curve
and the peak luminosity. However, from work by Pinto & Eastman
(2000a,b), we expect this effect to be small.

Fig. 3 shows the bolometric light curves of all models rela-
tive to the time of explosion. Decreasing ejecta mass (shorter dif-
fusion time) corresponds to a faster evolving supernova. In days
since explosion, the bolometric luminosity maximum occurs at
14.4 (3.80×109 L(cid:12)), 14.4 (3.96×109 L(cid:12)), 15.84 (3.63×109 L(cid:12)),
and 17.42 (3.47×109 L(cid:12)) for models SUB1, SUB2, CHAN, and
SUP respectively. To characterize the bolometric light curves, we
list tmax (time of bolometric maximum), t−1/2 and t+1/2 (the
times to rise from half bolometric maximum luminosity to max-
imum and to decline from bolometric maximum back to half of
maximum – see Contardo et al. (2000)) in Table 2. Between ∼1–
1.7 M(cid:12), we have roughly a 1 day difference in half light rise times
(t−1/2), with SUB ejecta models rising faster. After bolometric
maximum, the SUP ejecta model takes roughly ∼ 3.5 days longer
than the SUB ejecta models to decline to half light (t+1/2). With
precise measurement determinations of the rise time in Lbol, we
can put stronger constraints on the ejecta mass for a given 56Ni
mass.

As the 56Ni mass is the same for all models, differences in the
bolometric light curve evolution are primarily due to ejecta mass.
However, despite differences in ejecta mass of ∼70 per cent, the
differences are relatively small, though measurable. This effect of
ejecta mass should be clearly visible from a statistical sample of
deep high cadence observations of SNe Ia.

Fig. 4 shows synthetic light curves plotted in days since B-
band maximum. The light curves for the two sub-MCh ejecta mod-
els tend to be more luminous at maximum (with the exception of the
NIR bands) but have fainter nebular luminosities. The former arises
because at bolometric maximum Lbol ≈ Ldecay and since the peak
is earlier, the decay rate is greater. The latter arises because of the

less efﬁcient trapping of γ-rays. Table 2 also lists the peak LC ab-
solute magnitudes for different Johnson bands (MU → MK ), rise
times (in days since explosion), and decline parameter ∆M15(X)
for a given band X. All bands show a faster rise time for lower-
mass ejecta models, just as they do for Lbol.

Observational evidence suggests that H-band photometry for
SNe Ia can provide higher accuracy than the B-band calibration
galactic distances (Krisciunas et al. 2004, 2007; Wood-Vasey et al.
2008). However, our models have a spread of almost one magni-
tude in the H-band at the time of B-band maximum light. Fol-
lowing the temperature separation between models (higher mass
→ cooler ejecta), the higher mass ejecta also show larger ﬂux in
the H-band at all epochs. Our light curves still show two peaks in
the H-band as normal SNe Ia do, a consequence of the ionization
shift in iron (and other IGEs) going from ionization states 2+→1+
(Kasen 2006). The second peak is of the same brightness for our
SUB models compared to higher ejecta mass models. Past the sec-
ond H-band peak, we see roughly a constant decline in all models
until close to 150 days past maximum light.

Fig. 5 shows the U − B, B − V , and B − R colour evolution
relative to B-band maximum. It shows that the lower mass models
are bluer at most epochs. There is over a magnitude difference in
B − R from sub-MCh to super-MCh around 25 days after Bmax.
SUB models are bluest in color post B-band maximum compared
to higher mass models. Post maximum, model SUP remains the
most red of all the models, while SUB1 remains bluer than other
models after +40 days, a result of higher temperatures and ioniza-
tion due to larger M (56Ni)/Mej. This is explored in Figs. 6 and 7
and then in Section 4 where we discuss the spectral evolution.

Fig. 6 shows the temperature evolution of our models, with
SUB1 and SUB2 maintaining higher temperatures at all epochs.
Fig. 7 shows the average ionization for a few IGEs such as iron,
cobalt, and nickel. SUB models show a higher ionization compared
to higher mass models, producing ejecta with bluer colors. The
monotonic temperature distribution of SUB1 below 5000 km s−1
is due to the lack of a ‘56Ni hole’. Fig. 8 shows the fraction of
the energy deposition from positrons to the total energy deposition
at about 216 days post explosion. At late times SUB1 maintains
a higher ionization in the innermost ejecta due to more assumed
local positron energy deposition. Generally speaking, SUB1 and
SUB2 have higher temperatures at comparable epochs than those

CHAN (bottom left), and SUP (bottom right). Notice the absence of the ‘56Ni hole’ in model SUB1 (i.e. presence of 56Ni), a result of having lower densities
during the initial explosion. Also apparent is the overlap of the nickel distribution with IMEs around 8000 to 12 000 km s−1 in all models.

Figure 4. The plots show all LCs as a function of age since B-band maximum. Unlike the bolometric luminosity (Fig. 3), the B-band LCs for SUB1 and
SUB2 are different – SUB1 is roughly 0.2 magnitudes brighter than SUB2 between ∼25-60 days post B-band maximum. This difference in evolution arises
because SUB1 lacks the ‘56Ni hole’ (Fig. 2), and hence is hotter, and has higher ionization, at lower velocities than SUB2. The H-band shows a triple peak
for model SUB2 as the ionization shifts downwards, enhancing charge 2+ and then 1+ ion abundances of IGEs like cobalt and iron.

of CHAN and SUP. We further discuss the implications of higher
temperatures in Section 4.

4 SPECTRAL DIAGNOSTICS

Spectra provide important constraints for distinguishing progenitor
and explosion models. However, despite a 70 per cent difference in
mass, model optical spectra (Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13) at most
phases are similar, consistent with work by Blondin et al. (2013)
who concluded that SNe Ia are mainly distinguished by their 56Ni
mass. This similarity is observed for classical SNe Ia where dif-
ferences in optical spectra are generally rather subtle (Filippenko
1997), which presumably occurs because of similarities in compo-
sition. Interestingly, optical spectra of models SUB1 and SUB2 are
remarkably similar for most phases of evolution, despite the dif-
ferent methods to produce these ejecta models. However, there are
differences between models, particularly in the infrared, and these
do give rise to useful diagnostics. We investigate these diagnostics
by comparing model spectra at time steps of approximately −10,
−5, 0, +5, +10, +20, +50, +100, and +200 days from bolomet-
ric maximum (Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13). Thus, when comparing
observational spectra of SNe Ia from comparable 56Ni mass, these
diagnostics will separate events by ejecta mass. Note that model
spectra are plotted for vacuum wavelengths; however, wavelengths
(cid:62)2000 ˚A listed are quoted in air.

Fig. 9 shows the early spectral evolution (−10, −5, and 0 days
relative to bolometric maximum) plotted in λFλ (arbitrary units).
We label the contributions of important species at bolometric max-
imum. Figs. 10 and 11 show the post maximum photospheric phase

(+5, +10, +20, +50) plotted in λFλ (arbitrary units). Figs. 12 and
13 show nebular spectra at +100 and +200 days post bolometric
maximum plotted in Fλ (arbitrary units). Contributions from im-
portant species are labelled. Notice the transition towards predom-
inantly forbidden lines in nebular spectra. These ﬁgures are used to
highlight important diagnostics.

4.1 [Ni II] 1.939 µm

In SNe Ia, the nickel abundance is sensitive to the progenitor mass
and/or explosion scenario. In 1D explosion modeling, higher cen-
tral densities have higher neutronisation that leads to more sta-
ble 58Ni being produced during nuclear burning (Nomoto 1984;
Khokhlov 1991a,b). This 1D modeling implies that sub-MCh SNe
Ia will show a lower abundance of 58Ni compared to MCh SNe
Ia (for the same 56Ni mass). However, 3D DDT modeling sug-
gests that the 56Ni hole predicted in 1D MCh WD DDT models
may be absent, and both 56Ni and 58Ni extend from the lowest ve-
locities to about 10 000 km s−1(Kasen et al. 2009; Seitenzahl et al.
2013). 22Ne settling in sub-MCh has also been proposed as a way
to enhance the neutronisation; however, the time-scale for gravita-
tional settling can be ∼ 109 − 1010 yrs (Bildsten & Hall 2001).
Therefore, nickel diagnostics, particularly at nebular times, may
constrain the progenitor scenario, nucleosynthesis, and explosion
mechanism (Woosley 1997; Iwamoto et al. 1999; Stehle et al. 2005;
Mazzali & Podsiadlowski 2006; Gerardy et al. 2007; Maeda et al.
2010; Mazzali et al. 2011; Mazzali & Hachinger 2012; Mazzali
et al. 2015). At nebular times most of the 56Ni will have decayed,
and any nickel emission features are due to stable nickel, and in par-
ticular 58Ni and 60Ni, which are expected to be underabundant in

B-band maximum all models have similar colours. As the ejecta ages, differences in the B − R colour become much larger – at B-band maximum, the B − R
colour differs by ∼0.3 mag between SUB2 and SUP, while at later epochs the colour difference between SUB1 and SUP can be in excess of 1 magnitude.

(1D) sub-MCh DDT models compared with MCh models. The width
of any observed nebular nickel feature will constrain the hydrody-
namic width of the emitting region, thus testing model predictions
about the presence of a 56Ni hole. Therefore, nickel features may
offer the best diagnostic for ejecta masses below MCh if ejecta do
or do not have 56Ni holes as predicted by 1D modeling.

In the optical nebular spectra at +100 and +200 days
(Figs. 12 and 13), the [Ni II] λλ7378,7412 lines are blended,
and hence not very useful
for abundance determinations.
However,
in the NIR there is a forbidden [Ni II] transition
(3d8(3F)4s2 F7/2 − 3d8(3F)4s4 F9/2) at 1.939 µm which in our
synthetic spectra is relatively blend-free. It overlaps with telluric
lines in low-redshift SNe, but higher redshift (z > 0.08) SNe avoid
telluric absorption. While observations of this line appear to be
rare, Friesen et al. (2014) ﬁnd evidence for this line in spectra of
SN2011fe, SN2014J, and SN2003du.

In our models, SUB1 shows no evidence of [Ni II] 1.939 µm.

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

On the other hand, SUB2, CHAN, and SUP show the line, with
a strength that correlates with ejecta mass. The absence of [Ni II]
1.939 µm in SUB1 arises from two effects — SUB1 has a smaller
amount of stable nickel (see Table 1) and a higher ionization than
the other models. The presence of 56Co under ∼3000 km s−1 in
SUB1 means that there is a great amount of heating from positrons,
which deposit their energy locally (Fig. 8). This, combined with the
lower densities, leads to both a higher temperature, and a higher
ionization (Figs. 6 and 7). Surprisingly, and despite their similar
ionization potentials, Fe II cannot be used as an ionization tracer for
Ni II. In SUB1 Ni III/Ni II is signiﬁcantly larger than Fe III/Fe II.
This arises because the photoionization of Ni II is dominated by
large resonances in its photoionization cross-section. Therefore, the
absence of [Ni II] 1.939 µm in SN Ia spectra at 100–200 days in-
dicates that the mass of the progenitor is below MCh. However, we
re-emphasize that SUB2 is a scaled MCh model, so it is not a true

4.2

Ionization

Once the 56Ni mass is determined via “Arnett’s rule”, which states
that the luminosity at bolometric maximum is equal to the 56Ni de-
cay chain luminosity, or using LC ﬁtting like that of Scalzo et al.
(2014a,b), one can separate different SNe Ia based on ejecta mass
using differences in ionization/temperature (see Fig. 6). This result
follows from the heating per gram available to the gas. The greater
the ejecta mass is, the lower the heating rate per gram is. Conse-
quently, ejecta with a larger M (56Ni)/Mej are hotter – see Blondin
et al. (2017) for ˙edecay ≡ Ldecay/Mtot. Indeed our models indi-
cate that low mass WD models, for a given 56Ni mass, maintain
higher ionizations throughout their spectral evolution.

4.2.1 UV-Blanketing

Previous studies focused on the UV variability and used the UV
spectral region for understanding SNe Ia. These studies looked at
the role of metallicity on UV blanketing (Lentz et al. 2000; Walker
et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Foley & Kirshner 2013) ﬁnding that
lower metallicities shift the blanketing blueward. Foley et al. (2016)
looked at a sample of SNe Ia and found the UV diversity linearly
correlates with the optical LC shape. In particular, the strength of
UV line ﬂux measurements (∼2030 & 2535 ˚A) increases with in-
creasing ∆m15(B). Other studies of UV variation hope to use it
as a cosmological utility (Ellis et al. 2008; Sullivan et al. 2009) to
improve standardizability. Therefore, understanding how Mej for
a given 56Ni mass inﬂuences the UV spectrum is important to the
astronomical community.

Until the ejecta begins entering its nebular phase (∼100 days),
we see larger UV blanketing shortward of 4000 ˚A for larger mass
ejecta. This effect is attributed to a temperature difference between
models. We see in Figs. 6 and 7 that below 25 000 km s−1models
with higher temperatures have higher ionizations, seen as a shift
in the line blanketing to higher frequencies. Pre-maximum spec-

Figure 7. Average ionization state for bolometric maximum (left) and 216 days post explosion (right) for IGEs. The average ionization is deﬁned as the total
number of free electrons from each species divided by the total species population. At bolometric maximum, the average ionization rises beyond 20 000 km s−1
due to the low densities inhibiting recombination. The average ionization state is higher for sub-MCh models, a result of more heating per unit mass. At nebular
times, SUB1 remains at a higher average ionization in the inner region due to a larger deposition of energy by positrons arising from the higher 56Co mass
fraction in the inner region (see Fig. 8).

differences show up as absorption affecting the slope of the fea-
ture at ∼ 3500 ˚A. Post-maximum (Figs. 10 and 11), there is less
variation in UV blanketing between the models.

If we compare the peak ﬂuxes at bolometric maximum (Fig. 9)
of three UV features (namely the features near ∼2850 ˚A, ∼3150 ˚A,
and ∼3550 ˚A), we can characterize the level of blanketing by
comparing the ﬂux at peak in each feature. For all ejecta mod-
els, the ﬂux ratio F (3150)/F (2850) is close to unity (0.93, 1.07,
1.03, and 1.11 for SUB1, SUB2, CHAN, and SUP). However,
comparing these lines to the feature just short of the Ca II H&K
and Si II ∼λ3660 ˚A absorption proﬁle, we see that the ﬂux ratio
F (3550)/F (2850) is strongly dependent on ejecta mass. This ﬂux
ratio F (3550)/F (2850) is 0.99, 1.01, 1.20, and 1.75 for SUB1,
SUB2, CHAN, and SUP. These UV features reﬂect the tempera-
ture and ionization of the ejecta and offer a diagnostic of ejecta
mass for a given 56Ni mass.

4.2.2 Optical and IR

Besides variations in UV blanketing, other ionization diagnostics
are seen in optical and infrared spectra. For instance, leading up
to maximum (Fig. 9), each model shows a different strength of the
Si III triplet (λλ4553,4568,4575) absorption, which is strongest in
the models SUB1 and SUB2. SNe Ia typically classiﬁed as normal,
such as SN2011fe, show the Si III feature around 4400 ˚A (Pereira
et al. 2013) as our model CHAN does. SNe Ia such as SN2003hv,
thought to be a sub-MCh event (Mazzali et al. 2011), show this ab-
sorption feature much more strongly (Leloudas et al. 2009), as in
our SUB models.

56Co) to the energy deposited by nuclear decays in the ejecta at about
216 days post explosion. SUB1 shows a much higher ratio shortward of
5000 km s−1 due to the lack of a ‘56Ni hole’ and higher 56Ni production
in the core. This leads to higher ionization and a higher temperature in the
inner region (in combination with lower densities) compared to other mod-
els.

tra show the Ca II feature (H & K lines near λ3500) is affected
by UV blanketing, making it difﬁcult to distinguish in SUP and
CHAN (Fig. 9). Ti II contributes to much of the blanketing more
than 5 days before maximum, while Ti II, Fe II, and Fe III shape
the UV spectra just prior to maximum. Around maximum, Co II
contributes much of the UV blanketing (below 3500 ˚A) with the
strongest blanketing occurring in model SUP. Looking inwards of
25 000 km s−1, SUB1 and SUB2 show a higher ionization of cobalt
than that of models SUP and CHAN. For Co II there is about a half
dex difference in ionization between SUB1 and SUP. These Co II

in λFλ vs λ in order to contrast the NIR tail of the spectrum. All models have been scaled by the same factor, and we have added an offset to allow spectra to
be more easily distinguished. During these phases the optical spectra (3500 to 7000 ˚A) are very similar. However, there are differences in the amount of UV
blanketing occurring shortward of 3500 ˚A, and in the strength of O I and the Ca II NIR triplet. We also see that the strength of the O I feature decreases with
age while the Ca II NIR triplet increases in strength.

20973.15 ˚A) lines. Many of the Co II and Fe II features are absent
in SUB1, a result of the higher ionization.

Optical nebular spectra typically exhibit emission lines of
Fe III and Co III (Figs. 12 and 13). In the NIR S2+ and Ar2+
show up in our model spectra as [S III] λλ9068,9530, and [Ar III]
λλ7135,7751, with the strength of these features relative to [Fe III]
λ4658 correlating with higher ejecta mass. As will be discussed in
Section 6.3, our model spectra tend to exhibit too high an ioniza-
tion, especially after 40 days. In particular, they lack strong [Fe II]

(e.g., [Fe II] ∼4350 ˚A). However [Fe II] and [Co II] features are
readily identiﬁed in the IR, except for model SUB1. Since SUB1
comes from the explosion of a sub-MCh WD, its inner density is
lower throughout its evolution compared to SUB2, and this hin-
ders recombination. Further, SUB1 lacks the ‘56Ni hole’ seen in
the later models, and hence the temperature in the inner region is
higher than in the other models (see Figs. 6, 7, and 8).

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

4.3 C/O and IMEs

As the mass of C/O and IMEs is strongly correlated (by design from
the density scalings) with the ejecta mass for a given 56Ni mass
(see Table 1), one should expect that lines from C/O and IMEs will
provide a useful diagnostic tool for ejecta mass. As to be expected,
our models show stronger absorption features for oxygen and IMEs
for increasing ejecta mass. For example, the strength of absorption
due to the O I λλ7772,7774,7775 triplet absorption correlates with
ejecta mass in pre-maximum spectrum (Fig. 9). The feature fades
by a few weeks post bolometric maximum. Mg II λλ9218,9244 is
another feature whose strength correlates with high ejecta mass–see
Table 3 which lists the pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs) measured
by a straight line across the maxima of the absorption proﬁle; it also
fades within a few weeks post bolometric maximum.

Si II λλ5958,5979, observed roughly around ∼λ5750,
is
a spectroscopic classiﬁcation diagnostic for SNe Ia (R(Si) ≡
pEW(Si II λ5750)/pEW(Si II λ6100)) and, like other IME features,
its strength correlates with ejecta mass. Table 3 highlights the cor-
relation of pEWs of various features with ejecta mass of our mod-
els. Post maximum (Figs. 10 and 11), we see the strength of the
emission increase, giving a large morphological separation between
models. Calcium (as Ca II) also shows the same behaviour as Si II.
The absorption and emission strength of the Ca II NIR triplet dis-
tinguishes models throughout the spectral evolution. We ﬁnd that
the strength of this feature correlates with ejecta mass. We further
discuss the Ca II NIR triplet and the Si II λλ6347,6371 doublet in
Section 6.1.

5 EXPLOSION SCENARIO: SUB1 VERSUS SUB2

Since the explosion process and progenitor system are unknown,
we highlight and summarize useful diagnostics for distinguishing
our models of the same Mej. As mentioned earlier, SUB1 comes
from a detonation model of a sub-MCh WD, while SUB2 comes
from the DDT of a MCh WD, which was scaled in density to have
the same mass as SUB1 and the same 56Ni mass. Since SUB1
was detonated as a sub-MCh WD, it had lower densities when ex-
ploded compared to SUB2 and lacks the ‘56Ni hole’. Without the
‘56Ni hole’, SUB1 has a larger (assumed) local deposition fraction
from decay positrons compared to the total decay energy deposi-
tion (Fig. 8) for velocities less than 5000 km s−1. This keeps the
inner region of SUB1 hotter than SUB2, which shows stronger fea-
tures of higher ionization states of IGEs as the ejecta evolves past
the photospheric phase and exposes the inner iron-rich material. At
nebular times, the strength of [Ni II] 1.939 µm gives a clear dis-
tinction between SUB1 and SUB2, as lower density ejecta model
SUB1 does not show this feature.

Up to maximum light, SUB1 and SUB2 possess very similar
spectra (Fig. 9), especially in the optical. However, as the photo-
sphere begins to recede inwards differences are seen in the NIR –
Fe II and Co II features are absent in SUB1 but present in SUB2
(Figs. 10 and 11). Below 5000 km s−1, the densities in SUB1 are
roughly a factor of 3 lower than in SUB2. Further, SUB1 has a
larger fraction of local radioactive heating from positrons. These
factors inhibit recombination and a higher ionization persists in
SUB1 compared to SUB2. The NIR region is potentially the best
diagnostic for the ionization state of the ejecta in SNe Ia (shown in
Figs. 12 and 13).
This higher

ionization, seen in post-maximum spectra
(Figs. 10 and 11), yields lower ﬂuxes in the NIR. We see roughly

half a magnitude difference in the post maximum I, J, and H
bands. However, the magnitude difference between J and H grows
to ∼2 mag difference by 200 days post maximum.

6 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS

In this section we present additional investigations of our ejecta
models focusing on high velocity features and comparisons to ob-
servational data. We also explore shortcomings with our ejecta
models.

6.1 High Velocity Features – Si II & Ca II

High velocity features (HVFs) are absorption features, seen in the
strongest lines, that show a distinct difference in velocity (often
early and prior to maximum), by more than a few thousand km s−1
from the lower velocity, photospheric component (Gerardy et al.
2004; Mazzali et al. 2005a,b). Note the two strongest compo-
nents of the Ca II NIR triplet (λ8542 & λ8662) are separated by
∼4000 km s−1. Thus, any single Ca II NIR proﬁle may show an
absorption feature with two components separated by a few thou-
sand km s−1 which is different from a HVF. In many SNe Ia, HVFs
have even been observed at maximum for the Ca II NIR triplet but
not for Si II λλ6347,6371 (Childress et al. 2014). There is no clear
indication when HVFs start to disappear in all observed cases. Sil-
verman et al. (2015) state that the HVF Ca II triplet begins to disap-
pear around −1 days prior to maximum for ∆M15(B) = 1.4 to 1.6
mag, however discoveries of HVFs are potentially biased towards
those that persist closer to maximum light.

Shown in Figs. 14 and 15 is the evolution of the Si II doublet
and the Ca II NIR triplet, with a vertical line at −15 000 km s−1 as
a reference. In all models, Ca II HVFs are seen before bolometric
maximum (∼< −11 days). However, no HVF for Si II λλ6347,6371
is seen. Notice the striking difference in the pre-maximum Ca II
triplet proﬁle (∼< −11 days) and the proﬁle at later dates. The lack
of a Si II doublet HVF could just be a byproduct of atomic physics.
Although both the Ca II NIR triplet and the Si II doublet are not res-
onance transitions, the lower level of the Ca II triplet is metastable.
The lower level of the Si II λ6355 doublet is the 4s state which is
coupled to the ground state by a permitted transition. Therefore,
when compared to the Si II λ6355 doublet, the Ca II NIR triplet
persists longer because the metastable lower level population per-
sists longer.

By deﬁning a straight line between the maxima on either side
of the absorption proﬁles of these Si II features, we are able to com-
pute our models’ pEWs (listed in Table 3). Comparing our work to
ﬁg. 8 of Blondin et al. (2012), we ﬁnd our spectra are clustered
around those labelled broad-lined Ia as seen in Fig. 16. Branch
et al. (2006) looked at the pEWs of Si II features near λ6100 and
λ5750 in these spectra at maximum in order to group these spectra
in different classiﬁcations: “core-normal”, “broad-line”, “shallow-
silicon”, and “cool”. For the most massive model (SUP), it might
fall under the “cool” classiﬁcation from Branch et al. (2006), but it
lacks the strong Ti II absorption.

6.2 Comparison to Data

Here we present both light curve and spectral comparisons to data
for a span of spectral epochs. We focus on SNe Ia that have
claimed 56Ni masses similar to that of our models (0.6 M(cid:12)) or
similar ∆m15(B) and those tagged as sub-MCh (SN2005el), MCh

space in order to contrast the NIR tail of the spectrum. In each plot, all models have been scaled by the same value, and we have added a multiple of the
offset to more easily distinguish the models. The optical spectra is again similar showing still the strong Si II doublet at ∼6100 ˚A. The UV spectrum shows
stronger blanketing in higher mass models. The strength of the Ca II NIR triplet deviates between the models, showing stronger absorption/emission in the
cooler (higher mass) models.

pernova identiﬁcation program SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007) on
models at bolometric maximum to ﬁnd additional SNe Ia to com-
pare (SN1994ae). The spectra are taken from the CfA Supernova
Archive (Blondin et al. 2012). Archived light curve photometry
is taken from Open Supernova Catalog (Guillochon et al. 2017).
When comparing models to observations, the spectra are normal-
ized between λmin=4000 ˚A and λmax=7000 ˚A, such that

Normalizing spectra allows us to better compare spectral features,
removes uncertainties in distance, and compensates for small dif-
ferences in 56Ni mass. To compare LCs, we correct for extinction

using the CCM reddening law (Cardelli et al. 1989) and literature
E(B − V ) and RV values. We normalize the LCs by adding a con-
stant offset (model and object dependent), such that Bmax = 0 mag
at t(Bmax). We also shift the LCs so that time of B-band max-
ima agree. Thus, uncertainties in distance and explosion time are
reduced. A constant value of 0.05 mag is included with the photo-
metric error bars for uncertainty in reddening. K-corrections, ex-
pected to be small, have not been applied. Photometric band mag-
nitudes and bolometric luminosities of the models at maximum are
provided in Table 2.

6.2.1

SN1994ae

SN1994ae exploded in NGC 3370 (z = 0.0043 – Riess et al.
1999; Jha et al. 2007) and was ﬁrst discovered on 14 Novem-
ber 1994 by van Dyk et al. (1994). It reached B-band maximum
(mB = 13.21 mag) on MJD 49685.5 with ∆m15(B)=0.96 mag
(Riess et al. 1999; Jha et al. 2007). For comparison, we reddened
our models using E(B − V ) = 0.0226 mag and RV = 3.1 (Jha
et al. 2007). Fig. 17 shows the spectral comparison of SN1994ae at
+0.0, +10.0, and +152.7 days after B-band maximum and nor-
malized LCs relative to band maximum are shown in Fig. 18.

At +0 days, our model spectra do not reproduce the veloc-
ity of the Si II λ6355 doublet and UV Si II triplet. Results by

differences emerge in the NIR, such as the strength of the Ca II NIR triplet and the growth of Fe II and Co II lines – see Section 4.2.2. Despite the lack of Fe II
and Co II features in SUB1 (a consequence of having lower densities and higher temperatures/ionization in the inner ejecta), spectra of SUB1 and SUB2 are
still fairly similar.

Figure 12. Spectral comparison between models in the nebular phase at roughly +100 days after bolometric maximum. We have scaled all models by the
same value, and plot Fλ vs λ. All models exhibit roughly the same amount of emission in the [Fe III] λ4658 line, but show substantial ﬂux differences in the
NIR. Unlike the other models, SUB1 lacks NIR Fe II and Co II features. Emission lines of [S III] λλ9068,9530, and [Ar III] λλ7135,7751 are present, and
increase in strength relative to [Fe III] λ4658 as the ejecta mass, and equivalently, as the mass of IMEs, increases.

Dessart et al. (2014a) suggest SNe Ia resulting from pulsational-
delayed detonations (PDD) retain more unburnt carbon and have
little mass at high velocity (∼>15 000 km s−1) due to pulsations.
Therefore, spectral features of SN1994ae might be best explained
by PDD modeling, and would resemble similar radiative proper-
ties of DDT models. The spectra also show evidence of the Si III
triplet (λλ4553,4568,4575) absorption as in our SUB models (an
indication of high ionization). Later spectra show cooler ejecta and
model SUP is closest to reproducing the features. However, at neb-
ular times (+152.7 d) our model optical [Fe III] lines appear too
strong and [S III] λλ9068,9530 are absent in the observational data.

For the light curve comparison, we shifted the LCs to give the
same time of Bmax and reddened the models with AB = 0.091,
AV = 0.070, AR = 0.057, and AI = 0.041 mag, obtained using
E(B − V ) = 0.0226 mag and RV = 3.1 from Jha et al. (2007).
We normalized the light curves to 0 mag at Bmax and shifted the
observational data by 12.98 mag. We see in Fig. 18 that our B-
band LC is consistent until 20 days post maximum, where our LCs
begin showing roughly half a magnitude more ﬂux. Model CHAN
matches well the V /R-band observations. However, our models fail
to reproduce the second peak in the I-band, and the disagreement
is greater in lower mass models.

6.2.2

SN1995D

SN1995D exploded in NGC 2962 and was discovered on 10 Febru-
ary 1995 (Nakano et al. 1995). Its redshift is z = 0.0067, and
it reached B-band maximum (mB=13.44 mag) on MJD 49768.7
(Riess et al. 1999; Jha et al. 2007). SN1995D has been argued as
having a 56Ni mass of about 0.58 M(cid:12) and an ejecta mass around
1.45 M(cid:12) (Childress et al. 2015). For comparison, we reddened our
models using E(B − V ) = 0.026 mag and RV = 3.1 (Jha et al.
2007).

Fig. 19 shows the spectral comparison of SN1995D at +3.6,
+42.5, and +93.5 days after B-band maximum. The early epochs
(+3.6 days) show good qualitative agreement with SUB1 except
our model shows a larger blueshifted Si II doublet. This may be
best explained by a PDD model (Dessart et al. 2014a). SUB1
also matches the UV spectrum shortward of 4000 ˚A. At later
epochs like +42.5 and +93.5 days, we see a better agreement
to model SUP and to CHAN, due to lower temperatures and
ionization. Roughly all features at +93.5 days are matched by
SUP. Despite the calculated 56Ni and ejecta mass being closest
to CHAN, SN1995D shows only moderate qualitative agreement
at later epochs. SN1995D transitions from looking like our SUB1
into that of SUP from early to late epochs.

To compare light curves, we shifted the LCs to give the same
time of Bmax and reddened the models with AB = 0.106, AV =

Figure 13. Spectral comparison between models in the nebular phase at roughly +200 days after bolometric maximum. We have scaled all models by the
same value, and plot Fλ vs λ. As at 100 days, SUB1 shows no prominent [Fe II] or [Co II] lines. Further, spectra of SUB1 in the J and H bands are now
substantially different from those of SUB2. The [S III] λλ9068,9530 and the [Ar III] λλ7135,7751 features have increased in strength relative to [Fe III]
λ4658. The broad emission feature covering 7000 through 7500 ˚A is a blend of [Ar III] λ7135, [Ni II] λ7378, and [Ca II] λλ7291,7324.

0.081, AR = 0.066, and AI = 0.048 mag, obtained using E(B −
V ) = 0.026 mag and RV = 3.1 (Jha et al. 2007). We normalized
the light curves to 0 mag at Bmax and shift the observational data
by 13.35 mag.

In Fig. 20, we see that our B-band LC is consistent with all
models until ∼12 days post maximum, where our LCs then be-
gin showing roughly half a magnitude more ﬂux. Model CHAN
matches well the V /R-band observations. Our models fail to re-
produce the second peak in the I-band (it occurs 10 to 20 days
too early) although the SUP model matches the data at late times.
Model SUP also seems consistent with the peak ﬂux ratios in
SN1995D.

6.2.3

SN2001ay

SN2001ay exploded outside IC 4423 and was discovered on 18
April 2001 by Swift et al. (2001). Krisciunas et al. (2011) and ref-
erences therein cite its redshift as z = 0.0302 and indicate that
it reached B-band maximum (MB = −19.19 mag) on 23 April
2001. For spectral comparison, we reddened our model spectra us-
ing E(B − V )MW = 0.026 mag, E(B − V )host = 0.072 mag, and
RV = 3.1 (Krisciunas et al. 2011). Krisciunas et al. (2011) states a
M (56Ni) of (0.58±0.15)/α M(cid:12), for an α = Lmax/ENi, typically
between 1–1.2. Given the close proximity between the estimated

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

56Ni mass for SN2001ay and that of our model set, we explore the
spectral similarities.

Fig. 21 shows the spectral comparison for epochs −1.5, +9.3,
and +56.3 days relative to B-band maximum. All models provide a
good qualitative ﬁt to the optical spectrum at −1.5 days, with SUP
exhibiting the worst ﬁt. While all models ﬁt the Si II λλ6347,6371
doublet in absorption strength and velocity, our models show
stronger absorption in the Si II λλ5041,5056,5056.3 triplet around
4800 ˚A. Blended with this feature is absorption arising from Fe II
λ5018, and this is also somewhat too strong in the models. The
biggest discrepancy between model and observation for the blend
occurs for model SUP. SUB1 lacks absorption at ∼4000 ˚A, which
is clearly present in the observations, and all of the other models.
No model reproduces the shape of the UV absorption near 3700 ˚A,
which could be due to a discrepancy with the Ca II H&K lines.

Later, model SUP qualitatively agrees the SN2001ay spectra
at +9.3 and +56.3 days best. At +9.3 days, SUP shows agree-
ment despite its stronger Fe II absorption lines around 4800 ˚A.
At +56.3 days, the spectra is dominated by Fe II features, which
SUP matches well given its cooler temperatures and lower ioniza-
tion. Models SUB1, SUB2, and CHAN are too highly ionized, and
exhibit too much emission from higher ionization states such as
Fe III. Despite matching much of the optical spectrum, SUP does
not match well the absorption features associated with the Ca II
NIR triplet and the Ca II H&K lines. Given the discrepancy with

calcium at −1.5 days, this may indicate that the calcium abundance
is too high, or that the distribution in velocity space is incorrect.

For the light curve comparison, we reddened the models with
AB = 0.397, AV = 0.307, AR = 0.148, and AI = 0.178 mag, by
combining host and MW values as E(B − V )=0.098 mag and
RV =3.1 (Krisciunas et al. 2011). We normalize the light curves
to 0 mag at Bmax and shift the observed data by 16.35 mag. Fig. 22
shows our models fail to reproduce the post maximum decline ex-
cept for U/B-bands. Our models show too little V /R/I ﬂux in the
decline post maximum, but SUP agrees in peak ﬂux ratios between
bands with SN2001ay.

6.2.4

SN2005el

SN2005el exploded in NGC 1819 and was discovered on 19
September 2005 (Madison et al. 2005) at a redshift of z = 0.0148
(Hicken et al. 2009). It reached B-band maximum (mB = 14.84
mag) on MJD 53646.4 (Hicken et al. 2009). Scalzo et al. (2014a)
classiﬁed SN2005el as having 0.9 M(cid:12) of ejecta as well as 0.54
M(cid:12) of 56Ni, which, considering the errors in the determinations,
are close to our models SUB1 and SUB2. For comparison, we ap-
plied reddening to our models using E(B − V ) = 0.136 mag and
RV = 3.1 (an E(B − V ) value that is higher than that stated in
Scalzo et al. (2014a)).

Fig. 23 shows our spectral comparison to SN2005el. The early
epochs of −5.9 and +2.1 days show some qualitative agreement,
mostly with SUB1 and SUB2. At this epoch, our models do not re-
produce the Si II λλ6347,6371 doublet. Our models indicate a Si II
λλ6347,6371 doublet formed at higher velocities. Therefore, spec-

tral features of SN2005el may be best explained by a PDD model.
Unlike the Si II doublet, models CHAN and SUP do reproduce the
S II ‘w’ feature. Since our models show a higher blue-shifted Si II
doublet, it is not surprising that our UV does not match, given other
Si II and Ca II H&K features in this region. If the Ca II H&K lines
and Si II λλ3854,3856,3862 triplet are separated by thousands of
km s−1, then it is likely to result in the spike seen at the bottom of
the 3700 ˚A absorption feature, whereas our models show one broad
absorption feature around 3700 ˚A – seen in SN2008ec, for exam-
ple). Given the strong absorption proﬁle around 4400 ˚A, we suggest
this is the Si III λλ4553,4568,4575 triplet, indicating a high ioniza-
tion at this epoch.

At +24.9 days, we see that model SUP agrees qualitatively
in almost all features. Other models are too blue compared to the
cooler SUP model. This is surprising given the claim that SN2005el
is a sub-MCh SN with an ejecta mass of only 0.9 M(cid:12). The discrep-
ancy around 5300 ˚A could be the result of differences in the Fe II
or Cr II absorption.

One should expect SUB1 or SUB2 to resemble the spectral
evolution of SN2005el; however, we only see that SUB1 matches
prior to maximum and does not match SN2005el at late epochs,
where SUP shows best agreement. There are several possible expla-
nations for the inconsistencies. First, the 56Ni mass may be lower
than 0.54 M(cid:12). Second, the poor agreement in the extent of the Si II
λλ6347,6371 doublet could indicate a different explosion scenario
(such as PDD mentioned earlier – little mass at high velocity).

To compare light curves, we shifted the LCs relative to the
time of Bmax and reddened the models with AB = 0.543, AV =
0.414, AR = 0.339, AI = 0.245, AJ = 0.122, and AH = 0.077 mag,

time behaviour in the H-band is reproduced, the NIR LCs do not
generally agree with the SUB models. The double peak structure in
the J-band observations is well produced by the models, although
in the H-band it less evident.

6.3 Model Setbacks and Theoretical Problems

When compared to observation data, our models do show a higher
ionization, especially in the nebular phase. The strength of the
[Fe III] λ4658 feature is too strong compared to other optical/NIR
features. Further, optical spectra lack emission such as [Fe II]
∼λ4350 emission, seen in nebular spectra of SNe Ia of Tauben-
berger et al. (2013) and Black et al. (2016), for example. Other
researchers have also had difﬁculty modeling the Fe II feature near
4350 ˚A (Spyromillo 2016, private communication; Sim 2016, pri-
vate communication; Mazzali et al. 2015; Friesen et al. 2017). It is
not surprising that these models struggle to get the ionization cor-
rect – there are no free parameters and the density structure and
element distribution is set by the adopted initial model.

At late times the super-MCh model was generally in better
agreement with observation – a result of the model being cooler
with lower ionization. Since we know that most of the observed
SNe we discussed are not super-MCh, there is a fundamental prob-
lem with the models. This problem might arise from the adopted ex-
plosion models, be related to assumptions about mixing and clump-
ing, and/or be a problem in the ionization calculations. Since nebu-
lar spectra show strong [Fe II] and [Fe III], the Fe+/Fe2+ ratio must

obtained using E(B − V ) = 0.136 mag and RV = 3.1 slightly
higher than Scalzo et al. (2014a). The light curves were normalized
to 0 mag at Bmax and we adjust the observational data by 14.76
mag. In Fig. 24, we see the optical bands are reproduced well with
our SUB models (except B beyond 20 days). Although the late

comparison, we reddened our models using E(B − V ) = 0.0226 mag and RV = 3.1 (Jha et al. 2007). All ﬂuxes have been normalized between 4000-7000
˚A according to Eqn. 1. The observational data was taken from public CfA data https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/SNarchive.html.
At +0 days, we see that our model spectra do not reproduce the velocity of the Si II λ6347,6371 doublet and the UV Si II triplet. The spectra show evidence
of the Si III triplet (λλ4553,4568,4575) absorption as do our SUB models (an indication of high ionization). Spectra at later epochs indicate cooler ejecta
and model SUP is closest to reproducing the features. However, at nebular times (+152.7 days) our model optical Fe III lines appear too strong and the [S III]
λλ9068,9530 lines appear to be absent in observed spectra.

maximum. Afterwards, our LCs show roughly half a magnitude more ﬂux. The V /R-band LC agrees with our model CHAN. Our models disagree with
observations in the location of the I-band’s second peak and more so for models with lower ejecta mass. Archived light curve photometry is taken from

be of order unity, and consequently it is sensitive to the Fe atomic
models (and the density structure).

The disconnect between early and late time modeling is not
unexpected. Early time spectra are dependent on the outer ejecta
whereas late time spectra are primarily dependent on the inner
ejecta. Further, the processes determining the observed spectra in
the photospheric and nebular phases are distinct, and subject to dif-
ferent uncertainties in the atomic data.

Another problem is the strong nebular [S III] λλ9068,9530
and [Ar III] λλ7135,7751 lines. The [S III] λλ9068,9530 does not
seem to appear in nebular spectra. However, it is not clear if [Ar III]
λ7135 is present. There are three additional transitions contributing
to that overall feature between 7000-7500 ˚A. There are two [Fe II]
λλ7155,7172 lines that overlap [Ar III] λ7135 and, depending on
the ionization structure of the ejecta, it becomes difﬁcult to deter-
mine the source of the feature in observations. However, atomic
physics of the [Ar III] λλ7135,7751 lines requires that the line ra-
tio, I(7135)/I(7751), should be a factor of 4.2, so if spectral de-
tections of [Ar III] λ7751 are possible, then one can determine the
strength of the blended [Ar III] λ7135 line. However, observed SN
Ia nebular spectra appear absent of IME lines. This could be due to
an absence of 56Ni in the IME zone. In our models, the presence
of some 56Ni in the IME zone means that positrons are available
as a heating source after the ejecta has become optically thin to
γ-ray photons. One would expect some level of mixing to occur
through Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities between these layers – see
Hicks (2015) and references therein. To address the problem of too
high an ionization, clumping, arising from radiation hydrodynamic
instabilities, should be considered in future studies. Our prelimi-
nary work shows that, as expected, clumping lowers the ionization,
and we will address this issue in a future paper.

Another possible explanation concerns the validity of the ex-
plosion models. We have considered only four models, and only
two of the explosion models were obtained from “ﬁrst principles”,
and even these were derived from 1D explosions. Alternative explo-
sion mechanisms might give rise to different density and abundance
proﬁles, and in particular, the spatial distribution of 56Ni. The later
will inﬂuence the amount of UV line blanketing, potentially intro-
ducing degeneracies with the ejecta mass. However, other diagnos-
tics (e.g. the NIR nickel line) provide additional information, and
can break the degeneracies. Further, despite the deﬁciencies, the

MNRAS 000, 1–25 (2016)

models have highlighted important diagnostics and questions that
can help facilitate future progress towards understanding Type Ia
SNe.

7 CONCLUSION

We have presented four 1D SN Ia models – three delayed deto-
nation models with masses of 1.02, 1.40, and 1.70 M(cid:12) and one
detonation sub-MCh model with a mass of 1.04 M(cid:12). By design, the
models have the same 56Ni mass of ∼0.62 M(cid:12) which allows us
to investigate the dependence of light curves and spectra on ejecta
mass. Despite the smallness of the model grid they serve to high-
light important diagnostics that can help facilitate future progress
towards understanding Type Ia SNe.

Our results show that despite large differences in ejecta mass,
the optical ﬂux throughout the photospheric phase shows less than
0.3 mag difference in peak brightness in the LCs, as well as nearly
identical spectral features. We have seen that the peak bolometric
luminosity of each model is similar to within about 15 per cent, and
the difference in rise time is less than ∼20 per cent. Due to differ-
ences in diffusion time, however, the two sub-MCh mass models do
evolve faster (pre-maximum) by a day as seen from the bolometric
luminosity and synthetic B-band LCs. There is only a slight differ-
ence (∼5 per cent) in the decline parameter, ∆M15(B), between
sub-MCh and super-MCh models. Our sub-MCh models have much
bluer colours at all epochs compared with SUP (B − R difference
of ≈ 0.3 mag at maximum and a difference in B − R ∼>1 mag
roughly 20 days post maximum). Our models show larger differ-
ences in NIR light curves, particularly with the H-band’s ∼1 mag
difference at maximum light between sub-MCh and super-MCh.

Spectroscopically, at most photospheric phases, the optical
spectra show the same gross features. However, the strength of UV
blanketing between 2000-4000 ˚A is found to correlate with ejecta
mass. Lower mass models have higher temperature and ionization
(as more heating per gram), and hence lower UV blanketing be-
tween 2000-4000 ˚A. M (56Ni)/Mej is the leading parameter con-
trolling this study. Higher mass models produce stronger IME fea-
tures, such as the Ca II NIR triplet and the Si II λ6347,6371 doublet
prior to the nebular phase, and stronger [S II] λλ9530,9068, [Ca II]
λλ7291,7324, and [Ar III] λ7135 in the nebular phase. Lower mass
models have higher ionization, as indicated by the presence of the

Figure 19. SN1995D compared to models at times +3.6, +42.5 and +93.5 days relative to B-band maximum which occurred on MJD 49768.7. We have
corrected for redshift with a value of 0.0067. We reddened the models with E(B−V )=0.026 mag and RV =3.1. All ﬂuxes have been normalized between 4000-
7000 ˚A according to Eqn. 1. The observational data was taken from public CfA data https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/SNarchive.
html. +3.6 days shows good qualitative agreement with SUB1, except our models have the Si II λ6355 doublet formed at a higher velocity. SUB1 also
matches the UV spectrum shortward of 4000 ˚A. Later epochs (+42.5 and +93.5 days) show a better agreement to model SUP and to CHAN, due to lower
temperatures and ionization. Roughly all features at +93.5 days are matched by SUP.

Figure 20. SN1995D multi-band LCs normalized to Bmax and corrected for reddening (see Section 6.2.2). B-band LC agrees until ∼12 days post maximum.
Afterwards, our LCs show roughly half a magnitude more ﬂux. The V /R-band LCs qualitatively agree with our CHAN model although our models fail to
reproduce the second peak in the I-band. However, model SUP agrees with the observational data at late times. Archived light curve photometry is taken from
Open Supernova Catalog (Guillochon et al. 2017), with references from CfA Supernova Archive https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/

Si III λλ4553,4568,4575 triplet near maximum and the lack of
strong Fe II and Co II lines in the optical post-photospheric/nebular
phase. Model SUB1, unlike SUB2, is dominated by strong [Fe III]
and [Co III] lines, such as [Fe III] λ4658, [Fe III] λ5270, [Co III]
λ5888, and [Co III] 1.5484 µm.

In the nebular phase, the [Ni II] 1.939 µm line is absent in our
sub-MCh detonation model, but readily visible in the three other
models. Potentially, the [Ni II] 1.939 µm line provides us with a
diagnostic of the amount of stable nickel (58Ni & 60Ni), unlike the
blended optical [Ni II] λλ7378,7412 lines. Its absence in NIR spec-
tra would provide strong evidence for a lack of a ‘56Ni hole’ and
potentially sub-Chandrasekhar mass ejecta (given 1D modeling).
However, complex ionization issues can inﬂuence the strength of
all [Ni II] lines, making absolute determinations of the abundance
model-dependent. Overall the NIR provides the best diagnostics for
distinguishing between our different SN Ia progenitor models.

In comparing our spectra to observation at times greater than
20 days post maximum, we consistently ﬁnd better qualitative ﬁts
with our cooler, high mass super-MCh model. Given that there is
a ∼20-70 per cent difference in claimed ejecta mass between our
compared observational objects and our super-MCh model, we sug-
gest clumping as a way to lower the high ionization and high tem-
peratures observed in our models. While it is difﬁcult to reproduce
all observational features due to the diversity of SNe Ia, we are able
to match some features shown in our comparison to observations.
Prior to maximum, the best choice of model varies. Agreement de-
pends on the velocity structure of the ejecta. For instance, the pho-
tospheric features Si II λλ6347,6371 and the Ca II NIR triplet ex-
pose the difﬁculty of reproducing the velocity structure of SN Ia
(Figs. 21 and 23, for example). Future efforts to reproduce the di-
versity of these features requires a better understanding of the outer
ejecta and explosion mechanism.

Parallel work has been undertaken by Blondin et al. (sub-
mitted to MNRAS) who studied SN 1999by using a low mass
model (0.9 M(cid:12)) and a model with a Chandrasekhar mass (both
with 0.12 M(cid:12)of 56Ni). They ﬁnd that the lower mass model pro-
vides a better match to the light curve, and exhibits a faster rise and
a brighter maximum. As in our study, the lower mass model does
not show the [Ni II] 1.939 µm line, which is seen in their Chan-
drasekhar model

progenitors we need to understand clumping and inhomogeneities
in Ia ejecta. Some insights can be obtained from multi-dimensional
explosion modeling, while additional insight might be obtained
from studies of young SN remnants that are not interacting with the
surrounding ISM. During the photospheric phase, more UV spec-
tral data will help to constrain the ionization and temperature of the
gas. More NIR spectral data will help to test our diagnostics, such
as the NIR Ca II triplet (or nebular [Ca II] λλ7291,7324), the neb-
ular features between 9000 ˚A-1 µm (such as [S III] λλ9068,9530),
and the [Ni II] 1.939 µm line (requiring SNe Ia at a high enough
redshift to avoid the telluric absorption). These nebular features can
provide leverage on the progenitor channel by constraining initial
densities ([Ni II]), the overlap between IMEs and IGEs ([Ca II]),
and the ionization structure.

As many more SN spectra become available it will be possible
to do systematic statistical comparisons between SNe which have a
similar initial 56Ni mass. As discussed above, our studies show that
Type Ia SN will exhibit systematic differences in spectra and multi-
band LCs as a function of ejecta mass, thus providing fundamental
constraints on the nature of the progenitors.

Figure 21. SN2001ay compared to models at epochs −1.5, +9.3, and +56.3 days relative to B-band maximum. Observed spectra have been corrected for
a redshift of z = 0.0302. Models are reddened using E(B − V )MW =0.026 mag, E(B − V )host=0.072 mag, and RV =3.1. All ﬂuxes are normalized in
the range of 4000-7000 ˚A according to Eqn. 1. Observational data was taken from public CfA data https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/
SNarchive.html. Early on, models reproduce velocity of the Si II λλ6347,6371 doublet. Models show stronger Si II λλ5041,5056,5056.3 triplet ab-
sorption seen around 4800 ˚A, and also show discrepancies in Fe II λ5018, seen around 4900 ˚A. SN2001ay shows similar Si III λλ4553,4568,4575 triplet
absorption as CHAN. No model reproduces the shape of the UV feature, most likely a discrepancy of formation velocity for the Ca II H&K lines. Later
spectral phases (+9.3 and +56 days) are best reproduced by SUP, indicating much lower temperature towards the innermost ejecta. SUP, however, shows a
stronger absorption feature of the Ca II NIR triplet. Given the discrepancies we see at −1.5 days with the Ca II H&K lines, SN2001ay shows a lack of strong
Ca II features.

Figure 22. Multi-band LCs for SN2001ay normalized to Bmax and corrected for reddening (see Section 6.2.3). Our models fail to reproduce the post maximum
decline except for U/B-bands. Models show too little V /R/I ﬂux in the decline post maximum. However, the peak ﬂux ratio between bands matches to model
SUP. A larger reddening and an adjustment of the time of B-band maximum would improve the comparison. Archived light curve photometry is taken from

Figure 23. SN2005el compared to models at times −5.9, −4.9, and +23.1 days relative to B-band maximum. Observed spectrum is corrected for a redshift of
0.0148. Models are reddened with E(B−V )=0.136 mag and RV =3.1. All ﬂuxes are normalized between 4000-7000 ˚A according to Eqn. 1. This observational
data was taken from public CFA data https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/supernova/SNarchive.html. Around −5 days, our models do not
reproduce the Si II λλ6347,6371 doublet. Models show line formation at higher velocities. Unlike the Si II doublet, CHAN and SUP do reproduce the S II “w”
feature. UV spectra is poorly reproduced due to formation velocities of Si II and Ca II H&K features in this region. If the Ca II H&K lines are formed a few
thousand km s−1 away from the Si II λλ3854,3856,3862 triplet (which our models show both sum to the broad absorption feature around 3700 ˚A), it is likely
to result in the spike seen at the bottom of the 3700 ˚A absorption feature. SN2005el also shows a strong absorption proﬁle around 4400 ˚A, which we suggest
to be the Si III λλ4553,4568,4575 triplet, indicating a high ionization. At +24.9 days, model SUP agrees qualitatively in almost all spectral features. At this
epoch, SUP has the coolest inner ejecta. This agreement is surprising given the 70 per cent difference in claimed ejecta mass. The discrepancy around 5300 ˚A
could be the result of differences in the Fe II or Cr II absorption.
