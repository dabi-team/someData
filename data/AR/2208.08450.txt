ABSTRACT
AR Scorpii (AR Sco) is the only radio-pulsing white dwarf known to date. It shows a broad-band spectrum extending from
radio to X-rays whose luminosity cannot be explained by thermal emission from the system components alone, and is instead
explained through synchrotron emission powered by the spin-down of the white dwarf. We analysed NTT/ULTRACAM,
TNT/ULTRASPEC, and GTC/HiPERCAM high-speed photometric data for AR Sco spanning almost seven years and obtained
a precise estimate of the spin frequency derivative, now conﬁrmed with 50-𝜎 signiﬁcance. Using archival photometry, we show
that the spin down rate of 𝑃/ (cid:164)𝑃 = 5.6 × 106 years has remained constant since 2005. As well as employing the method of
pulse-arrival time ﬁtting used for previous estimates, we also found a consistent value via traditional Fourier analysis for the
ﬁrst time. In addition, we obtained optical time-resolved spectra with WHT/ISIS and VLT/X-shooter. We performed modulated
Doppler tomography for the ﬁrst time for the system, ﬁnding evidence of emission modulated on the orbital period. We have
also estimated the projected rotational velocity of the M-dwarf as a function of orbital period and found that it must be close to
Roche lobe ﬁlling. Our ﬁndings provide further constraints for modelling this unique system.

1 INTRODUCTION

The binary system AR Scorpii (henceforth AR Sco) is composed of a
white dwarf with an M-dwarf companion in a 3.56-hour orbit (Marsh
et al. 2016). In contrast to cataclysmic variable systems (CVs), which
show this same binary conﬁguration, there is no evidence that the
white dwarf in AR Sco accretes mass from its companion. It is
further distinguished from other similar binaries by strongly pulsed
emission with a period of 1.97 minutes (see Fig. 1) over a broad
range of wavelengths, from radio (Stanway et al. 2018) to X-rays
(Takata et al. 2018), which led to it being dubbed a white dwarf
pulsar (Geng et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017). The physical process
behind AR Sco’s pulses is, nonetheless, not the same as for traditional
neutron-star radio pulsars (Katz 2017; Lyutikov et al. 2020). This is
inferred from the fact that no phase coherent radio emission has been

reported for AR Sco, and from the companion being within the radius
of the white dwarf’s light cylinder.

The pulsed variability of AR Sco was ﬁrst reported by Marsh et al.
(2016), who detected two components of very similar frequency
in AR Sco’s amplitude spectra, at ≈ 731 and ≈ 738 cycles per
day (c/d). The diﬀerence between the two values corresponds to the
orbital frequency, suggesting that the higher frequency component
represents the spin of the white dwarf, whereas the lower frequency
is a re-processed beat frequency. Marsh et al. (2016) also found the
maximum luminosity of AR Sco to be well in excess of the combined
luminosity of the stellar components. Given the lack of accretion
signatures (such as strong X-ray luminosity, broad emission lines, or
ﬂickering), they proposed this excess luminosity to be powered by
the spin-down of the rapidly-rotating white dwarf. They estimated a
spin frequency derivative of (cid:164)𝜈spin = (−2.86 ± 0.36) × 10−17 Hz s−1,
corresponding to a rate of loss of rotational energy of 𝐿 (cid:164)𝜈 = 1.5 ×
1026 W.

Potter & Buckley (2018a) carried out a Fourier analysis of data
spanning three years (2015 to 2017) but could not conﬁrm the spin-

down found by Marsh et al. (2016). Instead they found a spin fre-
quency derivative consistent with zero, but were only able to constrain
it to the broad range −20 × 10−17 Hz s−1to +10 × 10−17 Hz s−1.
On the other hand, Stiller et al. (2018) conﬁrmed the occur-
rence of spin-down, again from just three years coverage (2016
to 2018), but found that it had a signiﬁcantly larger magnitude,
(cid:164)𝜈spin = (−5.14 ± 0.32) × 10−17 Hz s−1, than determined by Marsh
et al. (2016). Stiller et al. (2018) argued that the apparent inconsis-
tency between the results of Marsh et al. (2016) and Potter & Buckley
(2018a) arose from an underestimate of (cid:164)𝜈spin in Marsh et al. (2016),
likely due to sparse sampling and low time resolution of their data.
They also pointed out that their value of (cid:164)𝜈spin could explain the dif-
ference in the spin periods found by Marsh et al. (2016) and Potter
& Buckley (2018a), being consistent with the spin period found in
both works. More recently, the spin-down rate was further reﬁned
to (cid:164)𝜈spin = (−4.82 ± 0.18) × 10−17 Hz s−1by Gaibor et al. (2020).
The spin-down rate measurements have thus converged, with the
most recent consistent with each other, but questions remain over the
earlier measurements. Marsh et al. (2016) based their measurement
upon data from the CRTS survey that preceded (by several years)
the more recent intensive follow-up data used by Potter & Buckley
(2018a), Stiller et al. (2018) and Gaibor et al. (2020). The CRTS
data were very sparse, and used relatively long exposures (30 secs),
which rightly raises a question mark over the reliability of Marsh
et al. (2016)’s measurement of spin-down (Potter & Buckley 2018a).
However, could Marsh et al. (2016)’s result, together with those of
Stiller et al. (2018) and Gaibor et al. (2020), point towards a genuine
change in the rate of spin down in AR Sco? Such behaviour is often
seen amongst close relatives of AR Sco, the intermediate polars (IPs,
see e.g. ﬁg. 2 of Patterson et al. 2020). If the same applied to AR Sco,
it could suggest that (ﬂuctuating) mass accretion has some role to
play in the spin-down, despite a relative lack of any other evidence
for accretion in the system (Marsh et al. 2016). A second puzzle is
why Potter & Buckley (2018b) obtained so loose a constraint upon
the spin derivative, some 30 times worse than Stiller et al. (2018)
from data covering the same time span. Is the Fourier-based method
somehow ﬂawed in the case of AR Sco?

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2022)

The orbital period of the system is also expected to change, as a
result of angular momentum losses caused by the interplay between
magnetic braking and gravitational radiation. Stiller et al. (2018) con-
strained the orbital frequency derivative to (cid:164)𝜈orbit (cid:46) 2 × 10−18 Hz s−1,
which at their precision implied (cid:164)𝜈spin = (cid:164)𝜈beat. An even tighter con-
straint of (cid:164)𝜈orbit (cid:46) 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1was found by Peterson et al.
(2019) using archival photometric plate data dating back to 1902.
They pointed out that their constraint is consistent with the semi-
empirical model of Knigge et al. (2011) describing angular momen-
tum loss in CVs, which predicts an orbital frequency derivative of
(cid:164)𝜈orbit (cid:46) 2 × 10−20 Hz s−1for AR Sco’s orbital period. Additional
studies of the orbital behaviour were performed by Littleﬁeld et al.
(2017), who found that the light curve shows a stable orbital wave-
form on timescales of days, but alters slowly over timescales on the
order of years.

As well as time-series photometry, time-resolved spectra have also
been obtained for AR Sco. The spectra in the visible show a blue
continuum added to the red spectrum of an M5-type dwarf, with
strong Balmer and neutral helium lines in emission (Marsh et al.
2016). The radial velocity variation of the emission lines suggests that
they originate near the surface of the M-dwarf facing the white dwarf.
Garnavich et al. (2019) found the Balmer lines to show signiﬁcant
structure as they vary over the orbital period. Similar to what is
observed for the orbital modulation of the light curve, the Balmer
lines show peak ﬂux between phases 0.4 and 0.5, and minima around
phase 0.11. The continuum shows a similar behaviour, but is further
aﬀected by fast variations on the beat period. Doppler tomography
shows that most of the H𝛼 emission originates on the face of the
secondary star, but satellite emission features are seen, which in
other systems have been attributed to long-lived prominences on the
secondary star (e.g. Parsons et al. 2016). Garnavich et al. (2019)
argued that the stability of these prominences requires the M-dwarf
to have a magnetic ﬁeld of the order of 100–500 G (Ferreira 2000),
which is comparable to the white dwarf magnetic ﬁeld strength at
the M-dwarf (∼ 200 G, Takata et al. 2018), implying that interaction
between the two stars’ magnetic ﬁelds is likely responsible for the
energy production in AR Sco.

A pulsar model for AR Sco is supported by polarimetric obser-
vations, which detected strong linear polarisation (as high as 40 per
cent) modulated on both the spin and beat periods (Buckley et al.
2017). The observed broad-band spectrum is associated with syn-
chroton radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated as the white
dwarf magnetosphere sweeps past the M-dwarf, resembling the emis-
sion from neutron star pulsars, but with a diﬀerent mechanism whose
details remain a mystery. Most likely it relates to direct interaction be-
tween the two stars, resulting in emission from the surface or coronal
loops of the M-dwarf, from the magnetosphere of the white dwarf,
or possibly through an associated bow shock (Geng et al. 2016; Katz
2017; Takata et al. 2017; Potter & Buckley 2018b; du Plessis et al.
2022). A collimated relativistic outﬂow, i.e. a jet, has also been con-
sidered, but seems to be ruled out by radio observations (Marcote
et al. 2017).

AR Sco’s nature, and the rapid spin-down of its white dwarf sug-
gests that it could be a missing link between the two major classes
of accreting magnetic white dwarfs, polars and IPs, which are dis-
tinguished by whether or not the white dwarf’s spin is synchronous
with the orbit of the binary (Katz 2017), but how AR Sco attained its
current conﬁguration is unknown. A prior stage of accretion-driven

white dwarf, when the M-dwarf is closest to us.

spin-up is required to explain the current spin period. However, the
high magnetic ﬁeld estimated for the white dwarf in AR Sco given its
measured spin-down (100–500 MG, Katz 2017; Buckley et al. 2017)
presents a signiﬁcant challenge, as an extremely high mass transfer
rate would have been required in the past to crush the magnetosphere
down to a co-rotation radius matching the 2 minute spin-period. In
an alternative model, Lyutikov et al. (2020) argued the magnetic ﬁeld
of AR Sco must be only ∼ 10 MG to allow its spin-up, and that this
is consistent with the observed spin-down rate if the material leav-
ing the M-dwarf is originally neutral. In that case, the material can
approach the white dwarf without interacting, until it is ionised by
the white dwarf itself. This model requires both that the white dwarf
temperature be such that the material is ionised only near the white
dwarf (𝑇eﬀ ≈ 12 000 K), and that the heated face of the M-dwarf is
cool enough not to ionise the gas before it heads towards the white
dwarf. Although the ﬁrst condition could be fulﬁlled (Garnavich et al.
2021), the heated face of the M-dwarf seems to be hot enough that
the material would have a high ionisation rate (Garnavich et al. 2019,
2021).

Another potential solution that reconciles the need for accretion-
driven spin-up and the apparently high magnetic ﬁeld was put forward
by Schreiber et al. (2021). They proposed that AR Sco only became
magnetic as a result of a crystallisation- and rotation-driven dynamo.
In this model, AR Sco would originally be non-magnetic, allowing
for straightforward accretion-driven spin-up. When crystallisation
starts to occur in the core of the cooling white dwarf, strong density
stratiﬁcation combined with convection creates the conditions for a
dynamo, generating the magnetic ﬁeld (Isern et al. 2017). If the ﬁeld
is strong enough, the rapid transfer of spin angular momentum into
the orbit may cause the binary to detach and mass transfer to cease,
leading to a system such as AR Sco.

The many open issues surrounding the modelling of AR Sco, as
well as its potential central role for constraining the evolution of CVs,
make precise observational constraints a valuable asset. In this work,
we analyse high-speed photometry of AR Sco obtained with ULTRA-
CAM (Dhillon et al. 2007), ULTRASPEC (Dhillon et al. 2014), and
HiPERCAM (Dhillon et al. 2021) spanning seven years (2015–2022),
and time-resolved spectra obtained with the Intermediate-dispersion
Spectrograph and Imaging System2 (ISIS) at the William Herschel
Telescope (WHT) and X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).
We further constrain the spin-down of the white dwarf using two dif-
ferent techniques, pulse-time arrival modelling and Fourier analysis.
We probe for evidence of orbital period change by modelling spin
and beat frequencies independently in the Fourier analysis. Based on
our photometry, we discuss the possibility of using AR Sco as a cos-
mic clock for timing observations. Using our spectroscopic data, we
perform modulation Doppler tomography (Steeghs 2003), extending
the work of Garnavich et al. (2019). We also measure the rotational
velocity of the M-dwarf as function of orbital phase to probe for
variability that could conﬁrm that the M-dwarf is Roche lobe ﬁlling.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 Photometry

We started a monitoring campaign of AR Sco shortly after its dis-
covery in 2015. We used three diﬀerent high-speed photometers:
ULTRACAM at the 3.5-m ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT),
ULTRASPEC mounted at the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (TNT),

and HiPERCAM at the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC)
(Dhillon et al. 2007, 2014, 2021). We observed it on a total of 68
diﬀerent nights, over a time span of almost seven years (2015–2022).
Our cadence varied between 0.1 and 9.1 seconds, with an average of
3.3 s. This includes the readout time, which varied with the conﬁg-
uration and readout mode, but was never longer than 15 ms. With
ULTRASPEC, we typically used a 𝑔 ﬁlter, with the exception of three
nights when a red-blocking KG5 ﬁlter (eﬀectively 𝑢 +𝑔 +𝑟) or an 𝑟 ﬁl-
ter was installed. For ULTRACAM and HiPERCAM, dichroic beam
splitters allow simultaneous observations in three or ﬁve diﬀerent ﬁl-
ters, respectively. Filters 𝑢, 𝑔, 𝑟 or 𝑢, 𝑔, 𝑖 were used for ULTRACAM
until 14 May 2017, after which they were replaced with similar ﬁlters
whose cut-on/oﬀ wavelengths match those of the typical Sloan Dig-
ital Sky Survey (SDSS) ﬁlters, but with a higher throughput, being
sometimes referred to as 𝑢𝑠, 𝑔𝑠, 𝑟𝑠, 𝑖𝑠, 𝑧𝑠 or "super" SDSS. These
"super" ﬁlters were also used for the HiPERCAM observations. For
simplicity, we omit the 𝑠 subscript in the text, but details of each of
our runs and ﬁlters used can be found in Table A1.

All datasets were reduced with the dedicated HiPERCAM data
reduction pipeline3. We performed bias subtraction, and ﬂat ﬁeld
correction using skyﬂats taken during twilight. We also used the
pipeline to carry out diﬀerential aperture photometry with a variable
aperture size, set to scale with the seeing estimated from a point-
spread function (PSF) ﬁt. We used the same comparison star for
all observations, with the exception of our two HiPERCAM runs,
for which the chosen comparison star was not in the ﬁeld of view.
Our default comparison star was Gaia EDR3 6050299715251225344
(𝐺 = 13.3, 𝐺 𝐵𝑃 − 𝐺 𝑅𝑃 = 2.3), whereas for HiPERCAM we used
Gaia EDR3 6050298302203861888 (𝐺 = 15.2, 𝐺 𝐵𝑃 −𝐺 𝑅𝑃 = 1.9).
For reference, AR Sco itself has reported values of 𝐺 = 15.0, and
𝐺 𝐵𝑃 − 𝐺 𝑅𝑃 = 1.4.

To extend our baseline to earlier years, we retrieved data for AR Sco
from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS, Drake et al.
2009). These data span from 2005 August 01 to 2013 July 08. The
typical CRTS exposure time of 30 s is short enough that the spin and
beat periods are not completely smeared out.

The observing times of all datasets were corrected to Barycen-
tric Julian Date (BJD) in the Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)
reference system.

2.2 Spectroscopy

We obtained spectroscopic observations of AR Sco in 2016 both with
X-shooter at the 8.2 m VLT (Vernet et al. 2011), and with ISIS at the
4.2 m WHT.

The X-shooter observations were carried out using a 1 arcsec slit
for the UVB arm (300-559.5 nm, 𝑅 = 5400), and 0.9 arcsec slits
for the VIS (559.5-1024 nm, 𝑅 = 8900) and NIR (1024-2480 nm,
𝑅 = 5600) arms. In the UVB arm, we limited our exposure time to
16.1 s to allow for sampling of the beat/spin variability and obtained
689 exposures (readout time was 14 s). A fraction of the spectra that
were taken continuously (the observations were brieﬂy interrupted
by clouds) is shown in Fig. 2. For the VIS arm, we obtained 42
exposures of 354 s ((cid:39) 3 times the beat period; readout time was
58 s). The same exposure time was used for the NIR arm, but the
diﬀerence in the way readout is carried out allowed 47 frames to be
taken (with a readout time of 8.2 s). The spectra were reduced using
the standard procedures within the ESO reflex reduction pipeline 4,

including telluric line removal using molecfit (Smette et al. 2015;
Kausch et al. 2015).

ISIS observations were obtained using the R600B and R600R grat-
ings in the blue and red arms, respectively. The central wavelength
was set to 4500 Å for the blue arm, and to 6200 Å for the red arm.
We used a 1.0 arcsec slit and set the exposure time to 7.3 s (blue)
and 8.0 s (red), whereas the readout time was ≈ 70 s. 1078 and
1081 consecutive exposures were obtained for blue and red arms,
respectively. All spectra were de-biased and ﬂat-ﬁelded using the
starlink5 packages kappa, figaro and convert. Optimal spectral
extraction was carried out using pamela and wavelength calibration
was performed with molly (Marsh 1989). Spectra taken with the red
arm are shown as a trail in Fig. 3.

3 DATA ANALYSIS

3.1 Pulse arrival time estimates

We have estimated individual pulse arrival times for each of our
observing runs with ULTRASPEC, ULTRACAM, or HiPERCAM.
As the pulse timing depends on the ﬁlter used (see Gaibor et al. 2020,
and Section 4.2), we have only used data taken with the 𝑔 ﬁlter for this
purpose. Our method is similar to that previously employed by Stiller
et al. (2018) and Gaibor et al. (2020), who used a Gaussian function

5 https://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/starlink

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2022)

to model the beat pulse peak. We ﬁrst estimated the location of each
peak using previously determined ephemeris for the beat period.
Next, we cross-correlated the data around each peak with a Gaussian
function with a ﬁxed width set to minimise the residuals when ﬁtting
the ephemeris. We experimented with standard deviation (𝜎) values
for the Gaussian ranging from 5 to 20 s, ﬁnding an optimal value of
10.1 s. To determine the maximum of the cross-correlation function,
which is the estimate for the location of the peak, we determined
the value at which the derivative of the cross-correlation changes
sign from positive to negative using Newton-Raphson iteration. The
initial ephemeris was also used to estimate the cycle number of each
peak measurement. We repeated the procedure recalculating the cycle
numbers using the derived ephemeris in order to get self-consistent
values; this was repeated until the assumed and ﬁtted ephemeris
showed no signiﬁcant change.

Data points aﬀected by clouds were manually ﬂagged in each run,
and for each peak we computed the resulting number of bad points.
Peak measurements were only accepted if the number of good points
exceeded the number of bad points by at least a factor of three.
Peaks were also rejected if the diﬀerence between the measurement
and predicted value based on the approximate ephemeris was more
than 10 per cent of the beat period. This method resulted in 3195
good pulse measurements (table included as Supplementary Mate-
rial). However, the beat pulses are known to show an orbital phase
dependence (Stiller et al. 2018), which needs to be corrected for. To
account for this orbital modulation, we performed an initial ﬁt to the
derived pulse times, and calculated the observed minus calculated
values (O-C) as a function of orbital phase 𝜙orb. We then modelled
the O-C behaviour with a Fourier series, and subtracted the mod-
elled O-C orbital behaviour from each obtained pulse arrival time6
(see Fig 4). Note that the values supplied as Supplementary Material
do not include this correction, as combining them with more data
can change the required number of Fourier components and their
coeﬃcients.

This same procedure cannot be applied to the CRTS data, since
the pulses are not individually resolved at the CRTS cadence. We
have instead determined the maxima by ﬁtting a cosine to the data.
We ﬁrst phase-folded the data to the orbital ephemeris of Marsh
et al. (2016), and modelled the orbital variability with a Fourier
series. The orbital contribution was then subtracted from each mea-
surement. Given the long-time span of the CRTS observations, the
spin-down can have a measurable eﬀect in the data. To account for
this, we subtracted a quadratic term obtained from ﬁtting the ULTRA-
SPEC/ULTRACAM/HiPERCAM data from the measured times. We
then ﬁtted cosines with a period ﬁxed to the beat period to the CRTS
data divided into two datasets at the midpoint of observations (2008
September 17). Data taken at phases showing excess scatter (see next
paragraph) were excluded. This resulted in two measurements for
the maximum of the beat pulse extending our baseline back to 2005,
with each representing the mean pulse time from three years of CRTS
coverage.

Finally, we carried out a least-squares ﬁt of a quadratic function to
the measured times and estimated cycle numbers. We excluded from
our ﬁt the measurements taken around orbital phases 0.05 and 0.55
(more speciﬁcally, in the ranges 0.987–0.140 and 0.455 and 0.635),
which show excess scatter because the maxima are less well deﬁned
around these phases (see Fig 4, as well as Gaibor et al. 2020, ﬁg.

6 We have used a Fourier series with four terms in the form 𝑆𝑖 sin(2 𝜋𝑖 𝜙orb) +
𝐶𝑖 cos(2 𝜋𝑖 𝜙orb) with (𝑆𝑖 , 𝐶𝑖) coeﬃcients in seconds given by (-1.752,
2.165), (4.723, -2.769), (-0.929, 0.734), (0.541, -1.382).

data, simultaneously modelled the identiﬁed dominant contributions
with a Fourier series, subtracted the model from the light curve,
and then re-calculated the Fourier transform of the residuals. The
modelling was done by performing a least-squares ﬁt to the data
with orbital contributions modelled as sine waves, whereas the spin
and beat contributions were modelled as cosines (we diﬀerentiate
between sines and cosines to make it clear what phase 0 implies).
Timing parameters were common to all data, whereas amplitudes and
phases were ﬁtted individually to each run. We started by subtracting
the fundamental frequency and the ﬁrst harmonic for the orbital
(Ω), spin (𝜔), and beat (𝜔 − Ω) frequencies. This revealed the next
main contribution to be the second harmonic of the beat frequency
2(𝜔 −Ω), followed by the combinations 2𝜔 −Ω, 4𝜔 −2Ω, 𝜔 −2Ω, the
third harmonic of the beat frequency 4(𝜔−Ω), 𝜔+Ω, and 2𝜔−3Ω. At
this point, the dominant peak became again the beat period, which
is not perfectly modelled using this procedure due to the varying
amplitude of the peak (see Stiller et al. 2018, and Fig. 6). Figure 8
illustrates this pre-whitening process.

Once we identiﬁed the main contributions to the observed light
curve, we carried out a ﬁt of the light curve including all of these con-
tributions using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) implemented
with emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We initially performed
a ﬁt with amplitudes and phases of all contributions allowed to vary
freely, but each set to be constant throughout the whole span of our
data. This led to a poor ﬁt of the light curve, as the amplitudes of
the peaks are not consistent over time (as shown in Fig. 6). We then
opted for initially ﬁtting each of our runs individually, with the tim-
ing parameters ﬁxed to the values obtained from a least-squares ﬁt to
all of the data, but amplitudes and phases free. The obtained ampli-
tudes and phases were then ﬁxed, and we carried out the MCMC ﬁt
with only the timing parameters, 𝑇 orb

as free. Since our runs typically do not cover a full orbit, the orbital
period itself is not well constrained from sinusoidal ﬁts to our data,
but it can be indirectly obtained by modelling the beat and spin fre-
quencies separately. We therefore allowed the spin and beat periods
to vary freely, and calculated the orbital period from their diﬀerence.
The linear term corresponding to 𝑇0 was allowed to be free for the

mean-square deviation (RMS) larger than 2.5 s after correcting for
orbital eﬀects. For the remaining 2135 measurements, the uncertainty
was recalculated as the RMS at the given orbital phase. Fitting these
measurements, we obtained the ephemeris:

and Gaibor et al. (2020) (−4.82 ± 0.18 × 10−17 Hz s−1) within 1 𝜎,
and with a 50-𝜎 signiﬁcance. Figure 5 shows the ﬁt of the quadratic
component of the ephemeris.

3.2 Fourier Analysis

In addition to using our photometric data to perform pulse arrival
time estimates, we also carried out a Fourier analysis. As in the
previous section, we focused on observations taken with the 𝑔 ﬁlter.
To minimise systematic eﬀects, we excluded any data points aﬀected
by clouds, and only utilised data employing our default comparison
star.

To identify the main harmonics and combinations contributing to
the observed waveform, we calculated the Fourier transform of the

orbital and beat periods, but constrained to be within one period of
our initial guess. For the spin period, as well as spin/orbit combi-
nations, 𝑇0 was set to be equal to the beat 𝑇0, but a phase shift was
allowed. A phase shift was also allowed for all harmonics. In addition
to the periods themselves, we also included the period derivative as
a free parameter for both spin and beat in our model. We have not
constrained them to be equal in order to probe for a signiﬁcant orbital
period derivative. Data points whose residuals were more than three
standard deviations away from an initial least-squares ﬁt were ex-
cluded from the MCMC ﬁt to avoid occasional strong peaks, which
typically have low uncertainties and could bias our ﬁt. Uncertainties
were inﬂated by a factor of 8 to achieve reduced 𝜒2 ≈ 1 (though we
report the 𝜒2 prior to this renormalisation below). Additionally, we
excluded data taken towards the end of our last run, 2022 April 26
(MJD > 59695.2125), because we noticed that the inclusion of these
data led to an increase in 𝜒2 of at least a factor of two, leading to
a poor solution. The reason behind this seems to be an inversion in
the strength of consecutive peaks (see Fig. 7), possibly caused by a
change in which pole generates the strongest synchrotron emission
power. This is also eventually observed in other runs, but has a par-
ticularly damaging eﬀect to the ﬁt when occurring in the last portion
of data, which plays an important role in constraining the frequency
derivatives. With the current data we see no evidence for a periodical
behaviour of such inversion, which seems to be stochastic. Future
observations will reveal whether this behaviour persists after our last
run.

When running the MCMC ﬁt, we at ﬁrst applied a prior forcing
the diﬀerence between spin and beat derivatives to be consistent
with the upper limit determined by Peterson et al. (2019), that is
(cid:164)𝜈spin − (cid:164)𝜈beat (cid:46) 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1. We obtained a solution with
𝜒2 = 18415210 (for 153527 datapoints), whose obtained parameters
are given in Table 1. Next we removed the prior and let (cid:164)𝜈spin and (cid:164)𝜈beat
vary freely. Without the prior, we obtain a solution with a lower 𝜒2
of 18381704 for the same number of points. Figure 9 shows a section
of the data with this best-ﬁt model, and Figure B1 shows a corner
plot of the resulting timing parameters. The obtained beat period
and spin and beat frequency derivatives are consistent at the 99 per
cent conﬁdence level for the two solutions, though the value of the
spin period and of 𝑇 beat
shift signiﬁcantly. Notably, in both cases we
obtain (cid:164)𝜈beat consistent with our pulse time arrival analysis. The main
distinction between the two ﬁts is that, without a prior, the diﬀerence

Figure 7. The inversion of pulse strength observed in our last run. The data are
shown as black dots, with our Fourier model shown in red. Data beyond the
grey dashed line was excluded from the Fourier ﬁt. The typical behaviour of
AR Sco consists of alternating strong (s) and weak (w) pulses, whose intensity
can get very similar in particular for certain orbital phases. However, after
MJD = 59695.2125 there was a particularly strong pulse where a weak pulse
was expected. After some pulses with the normal behaviour, the inversion
becomes persistent, which caused a large increase in 𝜒2.

between our spin and beat period derivatives implies a signiﬁcant
(cid:164)𝜈orbit = (8.43 ± 0.37) × 10−19 Hz s−1, higher than the upper limit
suggested by Peterson et al. (2019), whereas the value is naturally
lower, (cid:164)𝜈orbit = (3.68 ± 0.17) × 10−20 Hz s−1, when the upper-limit
prior is applied. We further discuss this result in Section 4.1.

3.3 Doppler tomography

Similarly to Garnavich et al. (2019), we have applied the Doppler
tomography technique to our obtained spectra. This technique con-
sists of mapping the observed line proﬁles at diﬀerent orbital phases
into velocity space, thereby allowing the line emission distribution in
the binary to be mapped (see Marsh 2001, for a review). We started
by analysing the H𝛼 line using our WHT spectra. Garnavich et al.
(2019) previously reported the existence of long-lived prominences
(see their ﬁg. 7), whose existence, they argued, requires the M-dwarf
to have a strong magnetic ﬁeld (100 − 500 G). Owing to the short
integration time of our exposures, we were able to search for vari-
ations of these prominences with beat period, which could indicate
that they are modulated by the interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld
of the white dwarf and the companion, since the beat phase tracks
the orientation of the white dwarf with respect to the binary orbit. As
can be seen in Figure 10, these features seem to persist regardless of
beat phase, suggesting that they are indeed inherent to the M-dwarf.
In addition, they seem to appear only for the H𝛼 line, whereas the
emission for other lines is mostly concentrated on the face of the M-
dwarf facing the white dwarf, though there are some substructures
that vary from line to line (see Figure 11). The detection of He ii
is particularly important, as it suggests a high temperature on the
M-dwarf’s heated face that would ionise material before it leaves the
star, which invalidates Lyutikov et al. (2020)’s model (as previously
pointed out by Garnavich et al. 2021). The location of this stream
also suggests interaction close to the M-star, in agreement with the
model suggest by Katz (2017), rather than to the white dwarf, as
proposed by Lyutikov et al. (2020).

It is important to note that persistent H𝛼 prominences have been
detected in other non-accreting systems, such as QS Vir (Parsons et al.
2016) or SDSS J1021+1744, in which they have been attributed to
long-lived material near the L5 point (Irawati et al. 2016). Promi-
nences are also shown by some CVs during low states, as reported

spectrum, the main contribution is again the beat frequency. Given the sparse sampling over many years, many aliases are seen, in particular one-day aliases at
this scale.

X-shooter spectra, which have a better spectral resolution than our
WHT spectra.

Both lines show components with a signiﬁcant orbital period mod-
ulation. Unlike the average amplitudes, which are somewhat dissim-
ilar for H𝛼 and H𝛽 given that only the former shows strong promi-
nences, the modulated amplitude shows a similar behaviour for both
lines. The sine component, which peaks at orbital phase 0.5, shows
two main components, one of which has a similar origin as one of
the observed H𝛼 prominences, whereas the other is located near the
trailing face of the M dwarf, much like seen for the HeII 4686 Å line.
The cosine component (peaking at phase 0.0) is mainly along the
line connecting the two stars, with an extension towards the same H𝛼
prominence seen in the sine map. This phase-dependent behaviour
is further illustrated in Figure 14. The extension seems to be lo-
cated between what would be the Keplerian and stream trajectories,
if there were any mass transfer between the two stars. This is similar
to what is seen in, for example, U Geminorum (Marsh et al. 1990). In
AR Sco’s case, there is no evidence for accretion; yet, the existence
of persistent prominences suggests the concentration of matter in the
region where the stream would be. The modulated emission could
thus result from a shock in this region resulting from interaction
between the two stars’ magnetic ﬁelds as the system rotates.

3.4 Rotational velocity of the M-dwarf

Evidence of ellipsoidal variation in AR Sco’s light curve suggests
that the M-dwarf is ﬁlling its Roche lobe, or very nearly so (Marsh
et al. 2016). For any star with a high Roche lobe ﬁlling factor, the
radius along the line of sight can change signiﬁcantly as it rotates,
which translates into variable projected rotational velocity, 𝑣rot sin 𝑖,
given that 𝑣rot = 2𝜋𝑅★/𝑃★ (where 𝑅★ and 𝑃★ are the radius and
rotation period of the star). Our X-shooter spectra include several
lines originating in the atmosphere of the M-dwarf that allow us to
probe for this 𝑣rot sin 𝑖 variability.

Following Parsons et al. (2018), we selected three sets of lines for
the estimates: the KI line at 7699 Å, the NaI lines at 8183/8193 Å,

Figure 11. Doppler tomography for the CaII H&K lines (left panel), and
for HeII 4686 Å (right panel). Both emissions originate mainly from the
irradiated Roche lobe of the M-dwarf, though the HeII line shows an excess
near the trailing face of the star, as also seen by Garnavich et al. (2019).

for instance for AM Her (Kafka et al. 2008) and BB Dor (Schmid-
tobreick et al. 2012). Similar to what we see here, these CVs also
show strong prominences mainly in H𝛼, with emission in other lines
appearing more concentrated near the heated face of the white dwarf
companion. Kafka et al. (2008) and Schmidtobreick et al. (2012)
noted that the prominences do not coincide with the location of the
outer Lagrangian points, L4 and L5, but Schmidtobreick et al. (2012)
hypothesised that the magnetic ﬁeld could alter the Roche geometry
and result in equilibrium points where the prominences are observed.
A magnetic ﬁeld has also been suggested by Parsons et al. (2016) to
explain the prominences seen in QS Vir, and could also be responsi-
ble for the features seen in AR Sco.

One of the assumptions of traditional Doppler tomography is that
the ﬂux of any point in the binary system is constant over time.
However, emission that is modulated with time is often observed in
interacting systems (e.g. Papadaki et al. 2008; Calvelo et al. 2009;
Somero et al. 2012). Steeghs (2003) extended the Doppler tomogra-
phy method to allow for emission modulated on the orbital period.
We applied this modulated Doppler tomography to the WHT spec-
tra H𝛼 line (Figure 12), and to the H𝛽 (Figure 13) line using the

Figure 14. The left panel shows the total modulated amplitude for the H𝛼
line as a vector map. The direction of the arrow indicates the orbital phase,
with the arrow pointing upwards for phase zero and going clockwise from
there (i.e. phase 0.25 to the right, and phase 0.5 downwards, and so on). The
length of the arrows is proportional to the amplitude. The panel on the right
is the same as the top right panel in Fig. 12, but it is repeated here with the
same scale as the vector map to facilitate comparison.

an orbital inclination of 60 degrees (Potter & Buckley 2018b; du
Plessis et al. 2019). The exposure length and the spectral resolution
were ﬁxed at values matching our X-shooter spectra. We estimated
the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of each line by ﬁtting a
Gaussian proﬁle, and did the same for the 1.252 𝜇𝑚 line (which is
the most isolated of the analysed lines). We then interpolated the
observed (close to linear) relationship between FWHM and 𝑣rot sin 𝑖
to estimate the 𝑣rot sin 𝑖 value of each synthetic proﬁle. We carried
out this estimate both for a completely Roche-lobe ﬁlling M-dwarf,
and for radii of 90, 80, 70 and 60 per cent of the Roche-lobe radius
(the latter corresponds approximately to the radius of an isolated
M-dwarf of mass 0.3 M(cid:12)). These radii are a linear measure of the
distance from the centre of mass of the M-dwarf to L1, that is a linear
measure of its radius relative to the Roche lobe, not a volume-based
measurement. Our results are shown in Fig. 15.

Though a lot of scatter is present in our measurements, in particular
around orbital phase 0.5 when the analysed lines from the M-dwarf
become much shallower, it can be clearly seen that a low degree
of Roche-ﬁlling is incompatible with the estimated values. Whereas
the reduced 𝜒2 for the 1.252 𝜇𝑚 line is similar for models with full
Roche-lobe ﬁlling and for a radius of 90 per cent of the Roche-lobe
radius (4.5 and 6.0, respectively), the value more than doubles for a
radius of 80 per cent (13.6), and increases by at least a factor of 5 for
70 and 60 per cent (34 and 62, respectively). Therefore, a radius of
less than 80 per cent of the Roche-lobe radius is very unlikely for the
M-dwarf.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 The rates of period change

Our pulse timing analysis builds on previous work (Marsh et al.
2016; Stiller et al. 2018; Gaibor et al. 2020) and further conﬁrms the
occurrence of spin-down, now conﬁrmed at the 50-𝜎 level through
this method. Moreover, we have shown that the spin-down rate has
been constant to within the observational uncertainties over a period
of 17 years for which there are data. Applying a quadratic term
correction based on other measurements to the CRTS times, as well
as excluding data taken at phases showing scatter, were crucial for
obtaining a good ﬁt to the CRTS data. Marsh et al. (2016) did not

and the KI line at 1.252 𝜇m. We have used the M4.5 template from
Parsons et al. (2018), which we found to yield a better ﬁt to these
lines than the M5 template. Our approach was to ﬁnd the value of
𝑣rot sin 𝑖 that minimised the 𝜒2 between the observed line and the
template. We normalised and continuum-subtracted both observed
spectra and template prior to ﬁtting. We also corrected the observed
spectra to the rest-frame of the M-dwarf.

In order to obtain model values for comparison, we utilised the
lprofile code, which is part of the lcurve package (Copperwheat
et al. 2010). We calculated phase-resolved synthetic line proﬁles
assuming the system parameters derived by Marsh et al. (2016) and

velocity is shown in the middle panel. Green circles are measurements from
the NaI 8183/8193 Å line, red triangles from KI 7699 Å, and blue squares

Marsh et al. (2016). The dashed line in the radial velocity panel is a sinusoidal
ﬁt to the data, which was used to correct the wavelengths to rest frame before
measuring 𝑣rot sin 𝑖. The bottom panel shows residuals to this ﬁt. The obtained
parameters agree to within less than one-sigma with those reported by Marsh
et al. (2016). In the 𝑣rot sin 𝑖 panel, the lines are for radii of 100, 90, 80, 70,
and 60 per cent of the Roche radius (from top to bottom).

take into account the large scatter at some orbital phases, which could
explain the discrepancy with more recent measurements.

For the ﬁrst time, we have also succeeded in obtaining an estimate
of the beat frequency derivative via Fourier analysis, obtaining a
value in good agreement with results from pulse arrival timing. In
order to obtain a good ﬁt to the data, amplitudes had to be ﬁt individ-
ually in each run given that the pulse strength is clearly variable with
time. In addition, data from our most recent observation for which
the strength of consecutive pulses was not consistent with the typical
behaviour had to be excluded. Possibly these measures have allowed
us to obtain a Fourier ﬁt consistent with the pulse timing analysis
when previous attempts have failed.

One puzzling result of our Fourier analysis was a signiﬁcant dif-
ference between our derived beat and spin frequency derivatives
when they were left to vary freely, which implies a measurable or-
bital frequency derivative. Our value of (cid:164)𝜈orbit = (8.43 ± 0.37) ×
10−19 Hz s−1is in agreement with the upper limit set by Stiller et al.
(2018), but is more than 20𝜎 above the upper limit derived by Peter-
son et al. (2019).

It is worth noting that Peterson et al. (2019) remarked that they too
obtained a non-null (cid:164)𝜈orbit if the timing uncertainties in their data were
not accounted for (which would be unrealistic). As their data included
photographic plate measurements, that is indeed a great source of
uncertainty, and they point out that it can be up to 11 minutes for their
data. Since the inclusion of uncertainties changes what is obtained
for (cid:164)𝜈orbit, that implies that the signiﬁcance of (cid:164)𝜈orbit depends on the
assumed uncertainties. Peterson et al. (2019)’s conclusion could for
example be altered if their uncertainties were overestimated, that is if
their timing measurements were more precise than they assumed. The
timing uncertainties in our measurements were taken into account,
though they are negligible.

pointing out that the models of Knigge et al. (2011) predict (cid:164)𝜈orbit (cid:46)
2×10−20 Hz s−1for AR Sco’s orbital period. However, this prediction
does not take into account that AR Sco is highly magnetic, which
aﬀects angular momentum loss (e.g. Kolb 1995; Cohen et al. 2012;
Belloni et al. 2020). The direction in which angular momentum loss
is aﬀected, however, is a subject of much discussion. According to
Liebert & Stockman (1985) and King (1985), the white dwarf mag-
netic ﬁeld would lead to enhanced magnetic breaking. They argued
that the wind from the donor can be temporarily trapped by the white
dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld lines, thus gaining angular momentum and
subsequently carrying more angular momentum out of the system.
Li et al. (1994), on the other hand, proposed the opposite: that the
donor’s wind would remain trapped in the system due to the white
dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld, leading to reduced angular momentum loss.
This model was supported by modelling of the polar population done
by Belloni et al. (2020).

Given that we ﬁnd a higher (cid:164)𝜈orbit than the upper limit suggested
by the non-magnetic semi-empirical model of Knigge et al. (2011),
this would require AR Sco to be losing more angular momentum
than a non-magnetic system, or enhanced magnetic braking. We
estimate (cid:164)𝐽magnetic (cid:38) 40 (cid:164)𝐽non−magnetic given the ratio between our
obtained value and the estimate using Knigge et al. (2011)’s model.
Considering the uncertainties surrounding angular momentum loss
in magnetic cataclysmic variables, particularly in the case of a unique
system such as AR Sco, it is hard to establish whether this is feasible
or not.

The orbital period change could instead happen at ﬁxed angular
momentum if it is triggered by structural changes in the secondary,
which can be explained by magnetic activity. Activity can aﬀect the
distribution of angular momentum within the star, changing its rota-
tional oblateness (i.e. the gravitational quadrupole moment), which
translates into a change in the gravitational ﬁeld. That in turn causes
the orbit and speed of the stars to change, altering the orbital period
of the system without aﬀecting its angular momentum (the so-called
Applegate mechanism, Applegate 1992; Lanza et al. 1998; Lanza
& Rodonò 1999). This model was proposed to explain the orbital
period changes often observed for eclipsing systems (e.g. Parsons
et al. 2010; Bours et al. 2016), which in many cases are well above
the rate expected from magnetic breaking. In addition, the rate of
period change caused by the Applegate mechanism is not constant,
and can even change in signal (i.e. the period can go from decreas-
ing to increasing and vice-versa). This could potentially explain the
discrepancy between our derived value and the limit obtained by Pe-
terson et al. (2019). This explanation of course requires the M-dwarf
to be magnetically active, which seems to be the case at least for
AR Sco.

4.2 AR Sco as a cosmic clock

The regularity and strength of the beat pulsations observed for
AR Sco, as well as the precise ephemeris that can be obtained for the
beat period, raise the question of whether AR Sco could be used for
calibrating the timing accuracy of high-speed observations. This is
potentially useful given that it is fairly bright, varies at a speed that
it accessible to many instruments, and there is not a need to target
particular eclipses. Whereas the ephemerides are precise to less than
a second, one important issue is their colour dependency. As already
pointed out by Gaibor et al. (2020), the times of the primary pulses
depend on the choice of ﬁlter, and their diﬀerence varies with orbital
phase. This is illustrated in Figure 16 for a section of one of our
HiPERCAM runs.

Peterson et al. (2019) support their own empirical estimate by

We have further showed that those persist throughout the beat cycle,
which suggests that they are not triggered by interaction between
the M-dwarf and the white dwarf. Instead they are likely inherent
to the M-dwarf, and remain stable due to its magnetic ﬁeld. Further
evidence for this is the fact that similar behaviour is observed for
other non-accreting systems (e.g. QS Vir, Parsons et al. 2016), and
even for CVs during low-states (e.g. BB Dor, Schmidtobreick et al.
2012), and is thus not unique to AR Sco. Likely the prominences
are explained by the magnetic ﬁeld altering the Roche geometry and
displacing the location of the L4 and L5 Lagrange points.

By performing modulated Doppler tomography, we have identi-
ﬁed the occurrence of emission modulated on the orbital period, in
particular along the line connecting the two stars, but also remark-
ably in the region where an accretion stream would be located if
there were mass transfer. A possible cause for this is a shock wave in
the long-lived prominence that is located in this region, triggered by
interaction between the two stars’ magnetic ﬁelds.

In addition, by measuring the 𝑣rot sin 𝑖 for diﬀerent orbital phases,
we provide evidence that the companion is likely ﬁlling at least 80
per cent of its Roche-lobe.

5 SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

We performed an extensive study of the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco
using precise photometric data spanning almost seven years, com-
plemented by CRTS data that extends our baseline to 2005. We
reﬁned the beat period ephemeris using pulse time arrival analysis,
detecting a non-zero frequency derivative at the 50𝜎 level. We also
conﬁrm this value via Fourier analysis. We performed two diﬀer-
ent ﬁts, ﬁrst constraining the diﬀerence between (cid:164)𝜈spin and (cid:164)𝜈beat to
be no more than 3.8 × 10−20 Hz s−1, the (cid:164)𝜈orbit upper limit found
by Peterson et al. (2019), and next leaving both to vary uncon-
strained. Both cases lead to signiﬁcant values of (cid:164)𝜈orbit, in the ﬁrst case
(3.68 ± 0.17) × 10−20 Hz s−1, and (8.43 ± 0.37) × 10−19 Hz s−1when
no prior is applied. This could suggest that AR Sco is undergoing
orbital period changes in excess of what is predicted by magnetic
breaking and gravitational wave losses, similar to what is observed
for many eclipsing systems and often attributed to changes in the
quadrupole moment of the M-dwarf due to magnetic activity. How-
ever, since the 𝜒2 values obtained for our two ﬁts are comparable and
they lead to very diﬀerent (cid:164)𝜈orbit estimates, we believe that there is no
strong evidence for measurable orbital period change at the moment,
though continuous monitoring might change this picture. There is
also no reason to believe (cid:164)𝜈orbit to be constant, as its value can depend
on the magnetic activity of the M-dwarf. Large changes have been
observed for post-common envelope systems (Parsons et al. 2010;
Bours et al. 2016).

We additionally carry out an analysis of time-resolved spectra ob-
tained with both ISIS/WHT and X-shooter/VLT. Modulated Doppler
tomography, performed here for the ﬁrst time, shows the occurrence
of emission modulated on the orbital period in the region where
an accretion stream would be. This region also shows long-lived
prominences that appear inherent to the M-dwarf, given their lack of
dependence on beat phase. The modulated emission could thus be
the result of shock interaction between the two stars’ magnetic ﬁelds
in this region as the system rotates. Our spectra also reveal evidence
of tidal deformation detected via the variation on the observed pro-
jected rotational velocity, which indicates that the M-dwarf must be
at least 80 per cent Roche lobe ﬁlling.

AR Sco remains a unique and puzzling system. If our ﬁndings
of a possibly signiﬁcant (cid:164)𝜈orbit are conﬁrmed, they could require the

with the 𝑢, 𝑔, 𝑟 , 𝑖, and 𝑧 ﬁlters (from top to bottom). The vertical lines show
the pulse arrival times obtained for each ﬁlter. In the two insets, it becomes
clear that there is a varying level of diﬀerence in the pulse arrival times.

depends on the desired accuracy. If the orbital phases around 0.05
and 0.5 are avoided, an accuracy of the order of one second could
be obtained fairly easily (see top panel of Figure 17), although a few
pulses times may require combining if signal-to-noise is low. Around
phases 0.35 and 0.85, the arrival times for diﬀerent ﬁlters converge,
so a better accuracy can be obtained, and one could perhaps hope to
calibrate to a few tenths of a second. However, for large telescopes and
high signal-to-noise, AR Sco is not fully reliable as a timing ﬁducial,
and systematic errors from the source itself will limit precision. An
overall important result is that, if the timing calibration is being done
with a speciﬁc ﬁlter, preferably an ephemeris obtained with the same
ﬁlter should be used. Nevertheless, AR Sco could prove useful in
some instances, for example as a quick check against the large errors
that can sometimes plague timing work, such as whether the start,
middle or end of the exposure has been used, and whether barycentric
corrections have been implemented correctly.

Our Doppler tomography conﬁrms the existence of prominences

system to be losing angular momentum at a higher rate than non-
magnetic systems, which could provide clues to explain the origin
of AR Sco. Alternatively, this could provide a probe for the mecha-
nism proposed by Applegate (1992), which allows for orbital period
changes at ﬁxed angular momentum. The detection of modulated
emission can shed light on the interaction between the M-dwarf and
the white dwarf, which remains not fully understood.
