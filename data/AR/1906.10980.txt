Abstract

The gallium anomaly, i.e. the missing electron-neutrino ﬂux from 37Ar and 51Cr electron-capture
decays as measured by the GALLEX and SAGE solar-neutrino detectors, has been among us already
for about two decades. We present here a new estimate of the signiﬁcance of this anomaly based on
cross-section calculations using nuclear shell-model wave functions obtained by exploiting recently
developed two-nucleon interactions. The gallium anomaly of the GALLEX and SAGE experiments
is found to be smaller than that obtained in previous evaluations, decreasing the signiﬁcance from
3.0σ to 2.3σ. This result is compatible with the recent indication in favor of short-baseline ¯νe
disappearance due to small active-sterile neutrino mixing obtained from the combined analysis of
the data of the NEOS and DANSS reactor experiments.

Keywords: Gallium anomaly, charged-current cross-sections, nuclear shell model,
neutrino-nucleus interactions

1. Introduction

Gallium-based solar-neutrino experiments, GALLEX [1, 2, 3] and SAGE [4], were designed to
detect pp neutrinos from the sun. These two experiments are unique in having been tested for
their detection eﬃciency by 37Ar and 51Cr radioactive sources. These sources emit discrete-energy
electron neutrinos (Eν < 1 MeV) based on their decay via nuclear electron capture (EC). Detection
of these neutrinos is achieved through the charged-current neutrino-nucleus scattering reaction

νe + 71Ga(3/2−)g.s. → 71Ge(J π) + e−

(1)

to the lowest four (ﬂux from the 51Cr source) or ﬁve (ﬂux from the 37Ar source) nuclear states in
71Ge. In this article we discuss also the analogous reaction

νe + 69Ga(3/2−)g.s. → 69Ge(J π) + e−

(2)

in order to test our calculated shell-model wave functions more comprehensively.

The scattering of 37Ar and 51Cr neutrinos oﬀ 71Ga leads mainly to the ground state and the
excited states at 175 keV and 500 keV in 71Ge. The scattering cross sections for the mentioned

three low-lying states can be estimated by using the data from charge-exchange reactions [5] or by
using a microscopic nuclear model, like the nuclear shell model [6]. In both cases it has been found
that the estimated cross sections are larger than the ones measured by the GALLEX [1, 2, 3] and
SAGE [4] experiments. The measured neutrino capture rates (cross sections) are 0.87 ± 0.05 of
the rates based on the cross-section estimates by Bahcall [6]. The related model calculations and
analyses based on them have been discussed in [7, 8, 9]. It should be noted that the response to
the ground state is known from the electron-capture f t value of 71Ge. The discrepancy between
the measured and theoretical capture rates constitutes the so-called “gallium anomaly”.

One of the explanations to the the gallium anomaly is associated with the oscillation of the
electron neutrinos to a sterile neutrino in eV mass scale [7, 9]. The same scheme could also explain
the so-called “reactor-antineutrino anomaly” [10, 11, 12], discussed, e.g.
in [9]. Searches for the
sterile neutrinos are under progress in several laboratories. However, it should be remarked here that
there is no accepted sterile neutrino model to explain the experimental anomalies consistently, and
also alternative solutions to the reactor-antineutrino anomaly have been proposed, like the proper
inclusion of ﬁrst-forbidden β-decay branches in the construction of the cumulative antineutrino
spectra [13].

2. Neutrino-nucleus scattering formalism

We now summarize the main points of the formalism for calculating cross sections for charged-

current neutrino-nucleus scattering. Details of the formalism can be found from [14, 15].

For the low-energy (Eν < 1 MeV) 37Ar and 51Cr neutrinos considered in this work the creation
of the two heavier lepton ﬂavors, µ and τ , is not energetically possible. At these low energies the
four-momentum transfer is small compared to the mass of the exchanged gauge boson W ±, that
is, Q2 = −qµqµ (cid:28) M 2
W ±. Therefore, to a good approximation the scattering can be considered in
the lowest order as a single eﬀective vertex with a coupling constant G = GF cos(θC), where GF
is the Fermi constant and θC ≈ 13◦ is the Cabibbo angle. The matrix element of this eﬀective
Hamiltonian can be written as

(cid:104)f |Heﬀ |i(cid:105) =

(cid:90)

G
√
2

d3rlµe−q·r(cid:104)f |J µ(r)|i(cid:105) ,

(3)

where J µ denotes the hadronic current and lµ = eq·r(cid:104)l|jµ(r)|ν(cid:105) [14].

The initial nuclear state in the scatterings of Eqs. (1) and (2) is the J πi

i = 3/2− ground state
of 69,71Ga. Assuming that the ﬁnal nuclear states in 69,71Ge also have well deﬁned spin-parities
J πf
f , the double diﬀerential cross section for the charged-current (CC) neutrino-nucleus scattering
is given by [14, 16, 17]

contain vector and axial-vector pieces, which depend on the four-momentum-transfer-dependent
nuclear form factors F V
1,2 (vector), F A (axial-vector), and F P (pseudoscalar). At low neutrino
energies the cross section is dominated by Fermi and Gamow-Teller type of transitions which
proceed via the operators F V(q)j0(qr)1 and F A(q)j0(qr)σ respectively [14]. There are also small
contributions from spin-dipole type transitions mediated by the operator F A(q)[j1(qr)Y 1σ]0−,1−,2−.

3. Results of nuclear-structure calculations

Figure 1: Experimental and theoretical low-lying energy spectra of 71Ga.

The nuclear wave functions and one-body transition densities (OBTDs) (see e.g.

[19]) were
calculated in the interacting nuclear shell model using the computer code NuShellX@MSU [20].
The calculations were done in a model space consisting of the proton and neutron orbitals 0f5/2,
1p, and 0g9/2 with the eﬀective Hamiltonian JUN45 [21]. The low-energy excitation spectra of
71Ga and 71Ge, of interest in this work, are presented in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively (see also
[21] for the 1–3 MeV range in 71Ge). For both cases the ground-state spin-parity
Honma et al.
is correctly predicted: 3/2− for 71Ga and 1/2− for 71Ge. The energies of the ﬁrst two excited
states in 71Ga agree well with the experimental spectrum but the ordering of the 5/2− and 1/2−
states is reversed. The second 3/2− state is also higher than the experimental one, with energy 882
keV compared to the experimental energy 511 keV. For 71Ge the ordering of the ﬁrst four states,
including the negative parity states which we are actually interested in, agree with the experimental

3

data. The qualitative features of the computed low-energy spectrum are also very similar to the
experimental one, with the gap between the 5/2− and 9/2+ states being much narrower than the
gap between the ground state and the ﬁrst exited state as well as the gap between the 9/2+ and
3/2− states. However, the shell-model-calculated energies of the excited states are a bit lower than
the experimentally determined states, with the 175 keV state predicted at 76 keV and the 500 keV
state predicted at 268 keV.

Figure 2: Experimental and theoretical low-lying energy spectra of 71Ge.

The electromagnetic properties are also pretty well predicted (see the original article of Honma
et al. [21] for details). For the ground state of 71Ga the theoretical electric quadrupole moment is
+0.155 eb [21] (with eﬀective charges ep = 1.5, en = 0.5) while the experimental one is +0.1040(8)
eb [22]. For the 9/2+ state in 71Ge the theoretical value -0.339 eb seems to agree perfectly with
the experimental value 0.34(5) eb [23], however, the sign has not been experimentally determined.
The magnetic dipole moments of the low-lying states are excellently predicted. With the g factors
gl = g(free)
the magnetic dipole moment of the 71Ga ground state is predicted to
l
be +2.188 µN which is in good agreement with the experimental value +2.56227(2) µN [22]. For
the 1/2−, 5/2−, and 9/2+ states in 71Ge the magnetic moments are +0.438 µN , +1.060 µN , −1.014
µN , while the experimental ones are +0.547(5) µN [24], +1.018(10) µN [25], and −1.0413(7) µN
[23], respectively.

and gs = 0.7g(free)

The calculations were also done for 69Ge and 69Ga. In this case the shell model reproduced the
experimental data even better. The ﬁrst three states in 69Ge were predicted with the correct spin
parities 5/2−, 1/2−, and 3/2−. The shell model energies 0 keV, 98 keV, and 189 keV agree well

4

with the experimental energies 0 keV, 87 keV and 233 keV. Also the electromagnetic properties are
well reproduced in this case [21].

For the calculation of the cross sections we use recently measured Q values and branching ratios
from [26] and the same L/K capture ratios as well as atomic overlap corrections as Bahcall in his
analysis [6]. The neutrino energies adopted here are for 51Cr 751.82 keV (9.37 %), 746.99 keV
(80.70 %), 431.74 keV (1.033 %), and 426.91 keV (8.890 %). For 37Ar the energies we use are
813.60 keV (90.2 %) and 811.05 keV (9.8 %).

4. Results for BGT values

The neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are proportional to the β-decay BGT values,
which could be, in principle, extracted from β-decay half-lives. This procedure gives us accurately
the ground-state-to-ground-state BGT value, but it is not implementable for the BGTs of the
excited states. Therefore, other techniques, such as performing charge-exchange reactions, must
be utilized. However, this technique can be problematic for some transitions due to the signiﬁcant
tensor contributions, as was shown to be the case for the (p, n) reaction leading to the ﬁrst excited
state in 71Ga by Haxton [8]. In this case, there is a signiﬁcant cancellation between the Gamow-
Teller (GT) and tensor (T) matrix elements. The interference between the GT and T NMEs is
described by the linear combination

(cid:104)f ||O(p,n)||i(cid:105) = (cid:104)f ||OGT||i(cid:105) + δ(cid:104)f ||OL=2||i(cid:105) ,

(5)

where i (f ) is the initial (ﬁnal) nuclear state and δ is the mixing parameter.

The calculated GT and T matrix elements are listed in tables 1 and 2. For 71Ga the matrix
elements for the scattering to the 3/2−
2 states are also included for comparison with the
available charge-exchange data. As predicted by Haxton [8], the GT and T contributions cancel
signiﬁcantly for 5/2−
Interestingly, the
GT and T contributions counteract each other also for the ground-state-to-ground-state transition,
meaning that a (p, n) reaction would underestimate the BGT value. This is signiﬁcant regarding the

validity of the BGT values reported by Frekers et al. [5, 27], since there these tensor contributions
are ignored. This leads to an underestimation of the ground-state-to-ground-state BGT value and,
since this is adjusted to the one extracted from β decay, to an overestimation of the BGT values to
the excited states. It should be noted that the value δ = 0.097 used here, as well as in the work of
Haxton, has been obtained by ﬁtting β transitions in the p-shell [8]. However, uncertainties related
to this choice are hard to quantify. A reasonable estimate might be 0.05 < δ < 0.15, meaning
that the overestimation in the ground-state BGT is somewhere between 10 % and 40 %. It should
be emphasized that this alone is not enough to explain the discrepancy between the shell-model
calculations and charge-exchange results, since the ratio BGT500/BGTg.s. is 0.207±0.016 according
to the charge-exchange experiment [27], while the shell model predicts a ratio as low as 0.019.

In [5] the projectile, target and relative angular-momentum transfers [Jprojectile Jtarget Jrelative]
were measured in the 71Ga(3He,3H)71Ge charge-exchange reaction. One possible explanation for the
remaining diﬀerence between the shell-model calculations and charge-exchange results relates to the
extraction of the [110] component of the angular-momentum transfers at 0◦, which corresponds to
the GT and T contributions. This was done in [5] by ﬁtting various angular-distribution functions,
with diﬀerent [Jprojectile Jtarget Jrelative] combinations, to the experimental angular distribution.
However, in the calculation of the distributions shell-model OBTDs calculated in the f p-space
using the Hamiltonian GXPF1a [28, 29] were used. This Hamiltonian does not seem to be the
best choice here: it for example predicts the level ordering of 71Ge as 5/2− ground state, 1/2− at
388 keV, and 3/2− at 1496 keV, which does not agree at all with the experimental spectrum. The
one-body transition densities turn out to be oﬀ as well. To replicate the experimental half-life of
71Ge one would need to adopt gA ≈ 0.6 and the ratios BGT175/BGTg.s. and BGT500/BGTg.s. are
predicted as 0.0025 and 0.695 respectively, which is not at all consistent with the ﬁnal experimental
values. Frekers et al. report the [110] component at 0◦ to be 92 % for the ground state and 87
% for the second excited state. It cannot be easily estimated how much and which way the use
of these OBTDs eﬀects the ﬁts and thus the percentages. In a scenario where the ground-state
[110] component is underestimated and/or the 500 keV-state [110] component is overestimated, we
would also have an other source of systematic overestimation of the ratio BGT500/BGTg.s.. For
example if the true [110] components for the ground state and the 3/2− state would be 95% and
70% instead and δ = 0.15, we would get roughly a 70% overestimate for the BGT ratio.

2 and 3/2−

What comes to the transitions to the 1/2−

2 states, the shell model is in agreement
with the charge-exchange results in that the transition to the 1/2−
2 state is the second strongest
after the ground-state-to-ground-state transition. However, the transition to 3/2−
2 is predicted to
be signiﬁcantly stronger than the one to the 3/21 state, while the results of Frekers et al. [27] would
imply this to be the weakest of the transitions. The shell model predicts qualitatively correctly
that the ground-state-to-ground-state scattering has a much lower cross section for 69Ga than for
71Ga, but the ratio ≈ 3 × 10−4 seems to be oﬀ from the experimental value ≈ 0.02. The inability
of the shell model to predict very low BGT values is due to the fact that there are cancellations of
single-particle matrix elements of roughly the same size, resulting in large numerical inaccuracies.
However, this is not a problem for the larger BGT values where theoretical uncertainties are usually
about 10 % [30]. On the other hand, the BGT values for the excited states in 71Ge are rather small,
but there should not be any problems with the numerical inaccuracies as large cancellations are
not present. Here we adopt a very conservative 50 % uncertainty for these transitions in order to
avoid overstatements regarding the signiﬁcance of the gallium anomaly.

The cross sections for the 51Cr and 37Ar neutrinos scattering oﬀ 71Ga are given in tables 3

positive-parity states are about 10−4 % and thus the fact that these were left out from the previous
analyses does not aﬀect the reliability of their conclusions.

6. Reassessment of the gallium anomaly

The gallium anomaly was originally discovered [31, 32, 33, 34] using the Bahcall cross sections
[35] reported in the ﬁrst line of Table 5, that have been obtained using the BGT’s measured in
1985 in the (p, n) experiment of Krofcheck et al. [36, 37] (see Table I of Ref. [35]), listed in the ﬁrst

corresponding to the BGT’s of Haxton [8, 9], Frekers et al. [5, 9], and the JUN45 calculation presented in this paper.

The ﬁrst line in Table 7 gives the ratios of measured and expected 71Ge event rates in the four
radioactive source experiments and their correlated average obtained using the Bahcall cross section,
which led to a 2.6σgallium anomaly.

In 1998 Haxton [8] published a shell model calculation of BGT5/2− that gave the relatively
large value in the second line of Table 6, albeit with a very large uncertainty. The cross sections
obtained with the Haxton BGT5/2− and the Krofcheck et al. measurement of BGT3/2− are listed
in the second line of Table 5. As one can see from Table 7 the larger uncertainties of the Haxton
cross sections lead to a slight decrease of the gallium anomaly from the Bahcall 2.6σ to 2.5σ, in
spite of the larger Haxton cross sections.

In 2011 Frekers et al.

[5] published the measurements of BGT5/2− and BGT3/2− in the third
line of Table 6, obtained with 71Ga(3He, 3H)71Ge scattering. They found a ﬁnite value of BGT5/2−,
albeit with a large uncertainty, which is compatible with the upper limit of Krofcheck et al. [36, 37].
On the other hand, the Frekers et al. value of BGT3/2− is about 2.9σ larger than that of Krofcheck
If one considers these Gamow-Teller strengths as applicable to the νe–71Ga cross section
et al.
without corrections due to the tensor contributions (that would require a theoretical calculation),
there is a signiﬁcant increase of the 51Cr and 37Ar neutrino cross sections with respect to the
Bahcall cross sections and an increase of the gallium anomaly to 3.0σ, as shown in Table 7.

From Table 5 one can also see that our JUN45 shell-model calculation of the Gamow-Teller
strengths, listed in the fourth row of Table 6, gives cross sections that are smaller than the previous
ones. As a result, the gallium anomaly decreases to 2.3σ, as shown in Table 7.

The gallium anomaly has been considered as one of the indications in favor of short-baseline
neutrino oscillations due to active-sterile neutrino mixing (see the reviews in Refs. [38, 39, 40, 41]).
In the framework of the 3+1 mixing scheme, which is the simplest one that extends the standard
three-neutrino mixing with the addition of a sterile neutrino at the eV mass scale, the survival

the gallium data with the four cross sections in Table 5. One can see that the Haxton and Frekers

The indication in favor of short-baseline νe disappearance due to active-sterile mixing is at the
level of 1.9 (∆χ2 = 5.7 with 2 degrees of freedom with respect to the absence of oscillations). This
value must be compared with the 2.2, 2.7, and 2.6 levels obtained with the Bahcall, Haxton, and
Frekers cross sections, respectively.

It is also interesting to compare our results for the gallium anomaly with the recent indication
in favor of short-baseline electron neutrino and antineutrino disappearance [43, 44] obtained from
the combined analysis of the data of the NEOS [45] and DANSS [46] reactor experiments. This
indication is independent of our knowledge of the reactor antineutrino ﬂuxes, because it is obtained
from comparisons of the detection energy spectra at diﬀerent distances from the reactor source.
Hence, it depends only on the experimental uncertainties, not on the theoretical uncertainties of
the neutrino rates and spectra that are widely considered to be larger than those estimated before
the discovery of the mysterious 5 MeV bump (see, for example, Ref. [47]).

A comparison of the results for the gallium anomaly obtained with our JUN45 shell-model cal-
culation with the NEOS and DANSS indications in favor of short-baseline oscillations is interesting
because the comparison presented in Ref. [43], where the Frekers cross sections have been used,
indicated an incompatibility of the 2σ allowed regions, with a tension quantiﬁed by a parameter
goodness of ﬁt of 4%.

Figure 4 shows the comparison of the allowed regions in the |Ue4|2–∆m2

41 plane obtained with
our JUN45 shell model for diﬀerent conﬁdence levels with the regions obtained from the combined
analysis of the data of the NEOS and DANNS reactor experiments, to which we have added the
more recent data of the PROSPECT [48] reactor experiment that excludes large values of |Ue4|2 for
0.7 (cid:46) ∆m2
(cid:46) 7 eV2. One can see that there is an overlap of the 90% CL allowed regions, indicating
41
a reasonable agreement between the gallium anomaly and the reactor data. The corresponding
parameter goodness of ﬁt is a favorable 16% (∆χ2/NDF = 3.6/2).

7. Conclusions

In this Letter we presented the results from large-scale shell-model calculations regarding the
scattering of 37Ar and 51Cr neutrinos oﬀ the 69,71Ga isotopes. The new theoretical estimates for

these cross sections are 6.80 ± 0.12 × 10−45 cm2 and 5.67 ± 0.10 × 10−45 cm2 respectively which are
2.5–3.0% lower than the previous predictions.

According to our JUN45 shell-model calculation of the cross sections of the interaction of νe’s
produced by 51Cr and 37Ar radioactive sources with 71Ga, the gallium anomaly related to the
GALLEX and SAGE experiments is weaker than that obtained in previous evaluations, decreasing
the signiﬁcance from 3.0σ to 2.3σ. Our result is compatible with the recent indication in favor
of short-baseline ¯νe disappearance due to small active-sterile neutrino mixing obtained from the
combined analysis of the data of the NEOS and DANSS reactor experiments.

The possible sources for the diﬀerence between the new theoretical cross sections and those
predicted by charge-exchange reactions were examined.
It is pointed out that the cross section
of the scattering to the 500 keV 3/2− state in 71Ge is most likely overestimated in the charge-
exchange reaction due to a particular combination of destructive and constructive interferences
between Gamow-Teller and tensor contributions.
