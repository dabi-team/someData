Abstract. The solar active region (AR) 12192 was one of the most ﬂare productive region of
solar cycle 24, which produced many X-class ﬂares; the most energetic being an X3.1 ﬂare on
October 24, 2014 at 21:10 UT. Customarily, such events are believed to be triggered by mag-
netic reconnection in coronal magnetic ﬁelds. Here we use the vector magnetograms from solar
photosphere, obtained from Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI) to investigate the magnetic
ﬁeld topology prior to the X3.1 event, and ascertain the conditions that might have caused
the ﬂare. To infer the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, a novel non-force-free ﬁeld (NFFF) extrapolation
technique of the photospheric ﬁeld is used, which suitably mimics the Lorentz forces present
in the photospheric plasma. We also highlight the presence of magnetic null points and quasi-
separatrix layers (QSLs) in the magnetic ﬁeld topology, which are preferred sites for magnetic
reconnections and discuss the probable reconnection scenarios.

1. Introduction

The solar corona represents a magnetized plasma with high electrical conductivity
whose evolution is determined by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The large magnetic
Reynolds number RM (= vL/η, in usual notations) of the corona ensures that the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines (MFLs) to remain tied to ﬂuid parcels during their evolution. In contrast,
instances of various eruptive events (ﬂares and coronal mass ejections) occurring in the
corona are believed to be signatures of magnetic reconnection: the topological rearrange-
ment of magnetic ﬁeld lines along with the conversion of magnetic energy into heat and
the kinetic energy of mass motion. Currently, the coronal ﬁelds are numerically extrap-
olated from the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds, as direct coronal measurements are not
available. Here we present a model for coronal magnetic ﬁelds derived from the varia-
tional principle of the minimum energy dissipation rate (Hu et al. 2008; Prasad et al.
2017) formulated by superposing three linear-force-free ﬁelds and its application for the
X3.1 ﬂare event of AR 12192 on October 24th 2014 at 21:10 UT.

2. Results

For the NFFF extrapolation, we select the vector magnetogram at 20:46 UT obtained
from HMI on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), roughly 20 minutes prior
to the ﬂare. In Fig. 1a, we show the large-scale sheared MFLs (shown in blue) near
the polarity-inversion line and also the MFLs constituting the spine-fan structure of a

the QSLs (regions of high squashing-factor Q; c.f. Fig. 1b). It is well known that 3D nulls
and QSLs are preferred sites for magnetic reconnections (Pontin 2012).

In Fig. 2, we overlay the above MFLs with the extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) 131 ˚A chan-
nel and the ultra-violet (UV) 1600 ˚A channel images from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) at 21:02 UT and 21:28 UT respectively, when the brightening in these
channels are maximum. The near accurate correspondence between the brightening ob-
served in the AIA channels with the MFL footpoints validate the NFFF extrapolations
presented here. The dynamics of the MFLs leading to the ﬂare require full MHD simu-
lations with these NFFF as initial ﬁelds. This would be presented elsewhere in future.
