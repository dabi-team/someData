Stellar Structures in f (

) Gravity with Tolman-Kuchowicz Spacetime

Lahore Campus, Pakistan

This paper is devoted to explore some relativistic conﬁgurations of stellar objects for static
spherically symmetric structures in the context of modiﬁed f (G) gravity, by exploiting the
Tolman-Kuchowicz spacetime [1, 2]. We develop the equations of motion for spherically symmetric
spacetime in the presence of anisotropic matter distribution by considering the physically valid
expressions of the metric potentials, ν = Br2 + 2lnC and λ = ln(1 + ar2 + br4). To attain the
values of the unknown constants we consider the observational data of Cen X − 3, EXO 1785 − 248
and LM C X − 4 star models. Further, by using evaluated form of the solutions we provide
many aspects which are described by the physical status like eﬀective energy density, components
of radial and transverse pressure, energy conditions, stability against equilibrium of the forces,
speed of sound, mass-radius relation, surface redshift, compactness parameter, adiabatic index and
anisotropic measurement. It is observed that all these features follow physically accepted patterns
and the resulting outcome is in the experimental range which depicts the viability of our presented
f (G) gravity models.

INTRODUCTION

), f (R,

The spatial behavior of accelerated expansion of universe has captured much attention in the modern generation of
cosmology and astrophysics [3, 4]. Recent evolutions in this era of cosmology have exposed new concepts to acquaint
the critical and observational innovations for this accelerated expansion of universe. Diﬀerent observations may
provide direct evidence related to the accelerated expansion as a consequence of high red-shift supernova experiments
[5], while large scale structures [6] and cosmic microwave background ﬂuctuations [7] yield indirect evidences. This
accelerating expansion of universe is caused due to a mysterious force named as dark energy which retains strong
negative pressure. Moreover, it is considered that the mysterious dark energy comprises almost 68% of the total energy
of the universe. Thus, in order to analyze the phenomenon of acceleration expansion, we need some modiﬁcations
to the classical theory. Such type of problems lead into the search of modiﬁed or extended theory of gravity that
might succeed in deﬁning the situations in which the general theory of relativity (GR) given unsatisfactory results.
As an alternative to GR, various gravitational modiﬁed theories have been proposed in the recent years. Some of
, T ) theories of gravity which have been developed by the composition
which are f (R), f (R, T ), f (
of curvature scalars, topological invariants along their derivatives. To describe the late time acceleration and dark
energy issues, the modiﬁcations of GR seem seductive. Furthermore, diﬀerent cosmological approaches and thoughts
provided by these theories are helpful to reveal the secrets behind the phenomenon of accelerated expansion of
universe [8]. In past few years, Einstein’s theory of relativity has been amended by many scientists. In these valuable
modiﬁcations one of the most simplest and well known modiﬁed theory [9] is f (R) attained by supplanting the term
Ricci scalar R with an arbitrary function f (R). These alternative theories of gravity paly a vital role to understand
the mysterious nature of the universe, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of universe [10, 11]. Another
remarkable theory which has attained eminence in the last few years is dubbed with the name, is modiﬁed Gauss-

Bonnet gravity, also known as f (
the Einstein Hilbert action, by replacing term R with f (R,
). In the scenario of large expansion of universe, the
additional Gauss-Bonnet term has resolved the deﬁciencies of f (R) theory of gravity [12]-[17]. It is considered that

In astrophysics, the study of compact stars have gained much attention.

in f (R) gravity [33]. The equilibrium condition of compact stars is found by Abbas et al.

various cosmic issues as an alternative to dark energy [19], the modiﬁed f (
) gravity provide an inﬂuential platform
for this purpose. Mak and Harko [20] investigated exact solutions of Einstein ﬁeld equations for some standard models
with anisotropic background. An analytical formulation for the solutions of ﬁeld equations with anisotropic matter
source was constructed by Chaisi and Maharaj [21]. Rahaman et al. [22] extended the technique of Krori and Barua
solution to the system of strange star with MIT bag model. Kalm et al.
[23, 24] also studied the compact stellar
objects by assuming anisotropic source matter under the Krori and Barua metric. The possibility for the existence of
higher dimensional compact star was explored by Bhar et al. [25]. The stability analysis and fundamental formation of
anisotropic compact stars were analyzed by Zubair et al. [26] in f (R, T ) theory of gravity. Further, the investigations
on the charged anisotropic solutions for the compact objects were formulated by Maurya et al. [27]. Recently, Ilyas
[28] discussed compact structures in modiﬁed Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of charge.
The relativistic massive objects known as compact stars can be expressed by GR as well as the gravitational extended
theories of gravity [29]-[32]. These compact stars have strong gravitational force due to its very small size and
immensely massive structure.
In recent
decades it has been considered a vigorous subject of research due to their fascinating physiognomies and structures.
Some exact solutions in the result of a collapsing star with anisotropic stress and heat ﬂux were explored by Goswami
[34], further they
et al.
also analyzed the physical features in the framework of f (

contribution in studying and examining the nature of compact stellar structures and matter at high densities [35]-[40].

where α1, β1 and n1 are arbitrary constants to be estimated depending on several physical requirements. Observa-
tionally well-consistent cosmic results are obtained by this model due to its extra degrees of freedom allowed in the
dynamics [45]. To probe the possible existence of the compact stars for the model (11), the values of constants are
picked in such a way that eﬀective energy density, eﬀective pressure and all energy conditions remain positive for

C. Boundary Conditions

The existence of physical and geometric singularities within the star is considered as the most important features
in the study of compact stellar objects. For the existence of singularises, we analyze the behavior of both metric
potentials eν(r) and eλ(r) at the center of structure r = 0. For a physical viability and stability of the model, the
metric potentials should be singularity-free, positive, monotonically increasing and regular inside the compact stellar
structure. The variation of metric potentials at the center of the star i.e. eλ(r=0) = 1 and eν(r=0) = C2 is shown
in Fig. 1. It is observed that the considered election on metric potentials are consistent with the above-mentioned
conditions. The graphical behavior shows that value of the both metric potentials at the center is minimum, then it
increase nonlinearly and become maximum at the boundary surface.

behaviour and capability of characterizing the realistic stars, we plot the graphs of these features.

IV. EXTERIOR METRIC AND MATCHING CONDITIONS

The intrinsic boundary metric remains the same, whether it is constructed from the interior and exterior geometry
of the star. This mechanism ensures that the metric components irrespective of the coordinate system across the
boundary surface will remain continuous. No doubt, in theory of GR the Schwarzschild’s solution is considered as
the appropriate choice to choose from the diverse possibilities of the matching conditions while exploring the compact
stellar objects. Also according to the Jebsen-Birkhoﬀ’s theorem statement, every spherically symmetric vacuum
solution of ﬁeld equations must be static and asymptotically ﬂat. Furthermore, as concern with the modiﬁed f (
)
G
) gravity models for
gravity, the Schwarzschild’s solution may be accommodated with a proper choice of viable f (

non zero density and pressure. Perhaps, this fact leads to the violation of Birkhof’s theorem in modiﬁed theories
of gravity [48]. A lot of work on matching conditions has been done by many authors ([30]-[31],[49]). The junction
conditions that appear in the extended theories of gravity implement some restrictions on the stellar objects are
proved by Goswami et al.
[33]. However for this goal many authors [50]-[53] have considered the Schwarzschild’s
solution, giving some fascinating results. At this juncture to solve the ﬁeld equations under the speciﬁed constraint at
r = R, the pressure pr(r = R) = 0, we match the intrinsic metric (7) to the vacuum Schwarzschild’s exterior metric,

V. PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF f (G) GRAVITY MODEL

In this section, we study various physical attributes of the anisotropic dense stellar objects such as, eﬀective energy
density, radial and transversal pressure, energy bounds, anisotropic factor, mass function, compactiﬁcation parameter
and analysis of surface redshift and adiabatic index of our proposed models for the speciﬁc values of the model
parameters.

A. Energy Density and Pressure Evolutions

The eﬀective energy density and pressure components inside the stellar system show maximal value due to densest
nature of compact relativistic objects. The graphical analysis of the eﬀective energy density, radial and transverse
pressure for considered compact star candidates with respect to fractional radial coordinate r/R is shown in Figs. 2
and 3.

(right panel) for stars, CenX − 3, EXO1785 − 248 and LM CX − 4, under viable f (G) gravity model 2.

From this graphical behavior it is clear that at the center of the compact stars, the eﬀective energy density and
components of pressure attain its maximum values and further approaches to the zero on the surface boundary, which
point out this fact that our stellar objects show very high compactness. These plots clearly demonstrate the existence
) gravity. The numerical values of
of anisotropic conﬁguration of compact stars for our suggested models in f (
eﬀective central density and radial pressure for three compact stars are shown in Table II and III. These physical
features are positive ﬁnite at the center, which conﬁrms that our present system is free from physical and geometrical
singularities.

9

Some physical properties known as energy conditions are very helpful to investigate the presence of the realistic
matter distribution. Furthermore, these conditions play a vital role to identify the normal and exotic nature of matter
inside the stellar structure model. These energy conditions have captured much attention in the discussion of some
cosmological issues. By using the energy conditions one can easily examine the validity of the second law of black
hole thermodynamics and Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems [56]. In cosmology many riveting results have been
described by the use of energy conditions [57]-[62]. These energy conditions are segregated into null, weak, strong
and dominant energy bounds and symbolized by NEC, WEC, SEC and DEC, respectively. These conditions in the
presence of anisotropic ﬂuid (7) for curvature-matter coupled gravity [63] are deﬁned as

C. The Modiﬁed TOV Equation for f (G) Gravity

Energy conservation equation of motion for our system is deﬁned by

µ T ef f

µν = 0.

(26)

(27)

The physically acceptable models must be stable under the three forces, viz., gravitational force (Fg), hydrostatic
force (Fh) and anisotropic force (Fa) in such a way, that the sum of the forces becomes zero for the system to be in
equilibrium, proposed by Tolman [1], and later on Oppenheimer and Volkoﬀ [64] i.e.

Fg + Fh + Fa = 0,

where Fg = ν
and Fa justify the condition of equilibrium for our system.

D. Stability analysis

Stellar structure’s stability plays an important role in examining the physical consistent of the models. To study
evolution of stellar structure conﬁguration, the role of stability is considered as a very critical and burning issue. A
lot of work on stability analysis has been discussed by many researchers. Here we consider Herrera’s cracking concept
[65] to probe the stability of our considered compact stars candidates via technique of radial and transverse sounds
speed symbolized by v2

tr. The radial and transverse speed of sounds are deﬁned as

sr and v2

v2
sr =

dpef f
r
dρef f ,

and

v2
st =

dpef f
t
dρ

.

(29)

1
To preserve causality condition, the radial and transverse sound speed must lie in interval [0, 1] i.e. 0
1, everywhere inside the star, for a physically stable stellar structure. Herrera and collaborators [65]-
and 0
[67] constructed new notion of the cracking concept to explore the potentially stable/unstable conﬁgurations of stellar

structures. One can easily assess that potentially stable/unstable regions within matter conﬁgurations are determined
by the diﬀerence of sound propagation. The region in which speciﬁcally the components of radial speed sound is greater
1, while for
than the components of transverse sound speed is known as potentially stable region i.e. 0
unstable region this inequality doesn’t hold. The evolution of radial and transversal speed of sounds for compact star
candidates Cen X
4 can easily seen from the Figs. 11 and 12 and it is noted

that matter conﬁguration relation is stable, as discussed.

The behavior of mass function in Fig. 13 clearly shows that the mass of compact star is directly proportional to the
radius which depicts that mass is regular at core i.e. M ef f
0. Here we can see from the graph that
maximum mass is obtained at r = R. Furthermore the mass-radius relation in the framework of f (
) gravity is also
compatible, while studying the neutron stars [35]. Moreover, Buchdahl [68] found a limit for the mass to radius ratio

EXO1785 − 248 and LM CX − 4 compact stars.

The strong physical interaction between particles inside the star and its equation of state can be described by
surface redshift. The variation of surface redshift and compactness factor for suggested compact stars with respect
to fractional radial coordinate is shown in Fig. 13. It increases towards the boundary surface of compact stars but
vanishes at the center. In our case, all compact stars satisfy Buchdahl condition and the allowed maximum value for
surface redshift is zs ≤

5.211 [69].

G. Adiabatic Index Analysis

The stiﬀness of equation of state can be described by the term adiabatic index, for a given energy density, and it
also illustrates the stability of the both relativistic and non-relativistic compact stars. The concept of the dynamical
stability against inﬁnitesimal radial adiabatic perturbation of the stellar system has been developed by Chandrasekhar
(as a pioneer) [70] and later on this idea has been successfully tested by many authors [71]-[76] for both the isotropic
and anisotropic stellar objects. In their work it is estimated that for a dynamically stable stellar objects the adiabatic
index must be greater than 4
3 in all internal points. The notation of the adiabatic index corresponding to radial and
transverse pressure for anisotropic ﬂuid is deﬁned as

indices is greater than 4

anisotropy, expressed as

graphically with the help of observationally data of the considered stars, which is presented in Table 1. If pef f

analysis of anisotropic measurement corresponding to fractional radial coordinate r/R shows decreasing behavior for
the considered stars, suggesting that pef f

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

G

In order to detect the equitable model for realistic geometry of internal compact stellar structures not only in
) gravity, is considered as an attracting challenge. Our motivation is to examine the
GR but also in modiﬁed f (
real composition of these compact stars in their internal cores under the consideration of two diﬀerent viable f (
)
G
gravity models. For this goal, we have certiﬁed these models for three diﬀerent observed compact stars, labeled
4 with an anisotropic source matter by considering the Tolman-
as Cen X
Kochowicz spacetime [41], with metric potentials ν = Br2 + 2lnC and λ = ln(1 + ar2 + br4), where a, b, C and B
are constant parameters. These arbitrary constant values are constructed by matching the interior of a metric with
Schwarzschild’s exterior metric. This aspect is very valuable to observe the physical behavior of the compact stars

The main aim of this study is to deal the compact stars with formulation of analytical models by consider-
) gravity. The graphical analysis and
ing anisotropic static source conﬁgurations in the context of modiﬁed f (
interpretation of these results exhibit some conspicuous properties related to these anisotropic compact stars as follows:

Geometry of the space time is described by the metric potentials. The evolution of metric potentials eν and eλ
with respect to the fractional radial coordinate r/R in Fig. 1 satisfy the condition eλ(r=0) = 1 and eν(r=0) = C2.
Both metric potentials have minimum value at the core of star and then increase monotonically away from the
center to surface. For a physical viability and stability of the suggested models, metric potentials should be
positive, ﬁnite and free from the geometrical singularities. The graphical behavior in Fig. 1 clearly shows that
our metric potentials are consistent and satisfy all the above requirements.

The variation of eﬀective energy density, radial and tangential pressure corresponds to the fractional radial
coordinate r/R for both models is regular at the center. The graphical behavior depicts that the eﬀective
energy density and both pressures are free from the central singularities. It is clear from the Figs. 2 and 3
that these features attain maximum value at the center and show continuously decreasing behavior away from
the center to the boundary of the star. The numerical values of eﬀective energy density and radial pressure
for suggested models at the center of the three compact objects namely Cen X
248 and
LM C X
4 are given in Table II and III. These numerical values clearly show that the value of central
density is higher than the surface density. This fact assures the high compactness of most dense stellar compact
objects.

It has been observed from the Figs. 4 - 7 that the radial derivatives of eﬀective energy density and anisotropic
pressures are negative, and at the center these values vanish. This fact conﬁrms high compactness at core of
the star.

It can be noted from the Figs. 8 and 9 that all energy bounds for our proposed models are well satisﬁed which
exhibit the realistic matter content.

To check that whether all forces namely, gravitational force (Fg), hydrostatic force (Fh) and anisotropic force
(Fa) are in equilibrium for our models, we studied the TOV equation in modiﬁed f (
) gravity frame of reference.
Fig. 10 yields that all the forces are in equilibrium, which endorse stability of our system.

The radial and tangential speeds of sound for compact stars are denoted by v2
st. The values of the
square of sound speeds lie within the range 0 and 1. From the Figs. 11 and 12, it can be easily seen that our
models are consistent with the causality condition. Further, our present system is consistent with the Herrera
cracking condition i.e. 0

1, which conﬁrms the stability of our system.

Fig. 13 shows that the calculated mass for our suggested models is very close to the standard observational data,
which depicts that our mass function is regular at the center of core. Further, the evolution of compactiﬁcation
factor and the behavior of surface redshift with respect to the fractional radial coordinate favor our models, as
the values of compactness and redshift factor satisfy the required limits.

The radial Γr and tangential Γt adiabatic indices have been constructed in Figs. 14 and 15. For a dynamically
stable stellar objects the adiabatic index must be greater than 4
It is clear from the
graphical representation that the value both adiabatic indices are greater than 4

establish the stable nature of our proposed models.

In the study of compact stellar structures, the role of modiﬁed f (
) gravity is very alluring. The study of possible
existence of compact stars and particle physics with their extremely dense cores has enforced the researchers for more
reliable solutions of the modiﬁed ﬁeld equations. As a ﬁnal comment, in this present study we have favorably showed
singularity free and entirely stable stellar system, which is advisable to express the anisotropic nature of compact
stars, by employing the Tolman- Kuchowicz metric. Here we observed that our proposed models in the framework of
modiﬁed f (
) gravity are consistent and stable, as all physical attributes of compact stars follow physically accepted
patterns.
