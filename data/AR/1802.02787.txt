Abstract  

We report on a direct method to measure the interatomic potential energy curve of diatomic 

systems. A COLTRIMS reaction microscope was used to measure the squares of the vibrational 

wave functions of H2, He2, Ne2, and Ar2. The Schrödinger equation relates the curvature of the 

wave function to the potential V(R) and therefore offers a simple but elegant way to extract the 

shape of the potential.

Introduction 

Interaction potentials between the building blocks of matter shape the structure of bound species 

on a fundamental level. In the context of atomic and molecular physics potentials of interest are 

e.g. the van der Waals potential or, within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the potential 

energy surfaces of molecules. For a given potential the Schrödinger equation is typically 

considered as the condition equation for the wave function of a bound system. Mathematically, 

however, also the reverse is true: a given bound state wave function Ψ(R) of a two-particle 

system determines the full functional dependence of the interaction potential V(R) between the 

particles:  

ℏ²
2µ

𝑑2𝛹(𝑅)
𝑑𝑅²
𝛹(𝑅)

+ 𝐸 

𝑉(𝑅) =

(1) 

Furthermore, the binding energy E is also contained in the wave function, as the wave function’s 

exponential decay for 𝑅 → ∞ is solely determined by the reduced mass µ of the system and E 

[1, 2]. The wave function of a diatomic vibrational ground state is real-valued. Therefore, such 

wave functions and their second derivative are experimentally accessible by measuring their 

density distribution. In molecular physics, today, state of the art imaging techniques like 

Coulomb explosion imaging provide such density distributions and hence open the door to 

pursue this direct access to interaction potentials as we will show in this paper. We utilize the 

measured square of the wave function of the van der Waals-bound systems He2, Ne2, and Ar2 as 

well as of the covalently bound H2 in coordinate space to obtain the respective interaction 

potential V(R) as a function of the internuclear distance R.

The traditional way of probing the potential between two particles is by performing elastic 

scattering experiments. The integral and differential scattering cross-sections rely on the exact 

shape of the internuclear potential, which therefore can be reconstructed analyzing the measured 

deflection pattern. Interference patterns, originating from different trajectories leading to 

identical deflection angles having different phases, enable a precise determination of the 

attractive, the repulsive, and the well region of the potential V(R). In order to extract the shape of 

V(R) from such measurement, generally two approaches are possible. Firstly, one can assume a 

theoretical potential function between two particles and calculate the resulting deflection pattern 

for a given relative particle speed. This theoretical pattern is compared to the measured one, and 

the parameters of the function are then varied until good agreement is reached [3, 4]. Secondly, 

one can solve the inverse problem of scattering and infer the shape of the potential directly from 

the angular- and energy-dependence of the measured cross-section [5, 6]. Our alternative 

approach using Eq. (1) does not rely on scattering experiments at all. While the accuracy of our 

method is not yet competitive to accuracies reached in the established techniques, they allow, in 

principle, for a direct access to the shape of the potential for the full range of internuclear 

distances R.  

Experimental approach 

We measured the square of the ground state wave functions of the diatomic systems H2, He2, 

Ne2, and Ar2 employing Coulomb explosion imaging using a COLTRIMS setup [7-9]. In brief, a 

supersonic gas jet consisting of the target molecules or rare gas dimers is intersected with 

ionizing light from either a synchrotron or strong femtosecond laser. Charged fragments created 

in the photoreaction are then guided by a homogeneous electric field towards a time and position 

sensitive micro channel plate detector. By measuring the positions of impact and the times of 

3 

 
flight of each charged particle the particles’ initial vector momenta can be reconstructed yielding 

all derived quantities as kinetic energies or emission directions. All charged photo fragments are 

measured in coincidence. The supersonic gas jet is created by expanding the target gas through a 

small aperture into a vacuum. For examining the rare gas dimers, additionally, a matter wave 

diffraction approach was employed as mass selector. While the expansion conditions were 

chosen such that considerable shares of helium, neon or argon dimers, respectively, occurred in 

the supersonic jet, clusters of other sizes are created, as well. In order to select the dimers from 

the condensed gas beam a 100 nm transmission grating has been installed in the path of the gas 

jet. The emerging diffraction separates particles in the gas jet according to their mass [10] 

towards slightly different deflection angles. The experiments were then performed by focusing 

the ionizing light into the part of the diffracted beam belonging to dimers. 

By doubly ionizing the molecular system under investigation, two ions repelling each other by 

their Coulomb forces are created. In the subsequently occurring Coulomb explosion the potential 

energy of the two ions (initially located at an internuclear distance R) converts into kinetic 

energy of the ions (kinetic energy release (KER)). The KER is measured using the COLTRIMS 

reaction microscope and can be used to reconstruct the internuclear distance at the instant of the 

ionization via the so-called reflection approximation (in atomic units): 

𝑅 =

1
𝐾𝐸𝑅

. 

(2) 

By recording a large number of Coulomb explosion events we obtain the distribution of 

internuclear distances R occurring in the system. Accordingly, this distribution represents a 

direct measurement of the square of the vibrational wave function |Ψ(R)|².

Results and Discussion 

A. H2 

As a first example we present our results on the hydrogen molecule. For this experiment we used 

single photon double ionization by 160 eV photons provided by the Advanced Light Source 

(ALS) synchrotron in Berkeley (same experimental setup as in [11, 12]). At this photon energy 

one of the electrons absorbs the synchrotron light and the second electron is released via a shake-

off or knock-off processes [13]. As Coulomb explosion imaging relies on the R-independence of 

the ionization process, we corrected our measured KER distributions for known small R-

dependences of the respective double ionization process. The photoelectron emission from 

homonuclear diatomic molecules is known to be strongly influenced by interference phenomena 

which appear due to the two-center nature of the molecule. This interference is known to 

modulate the photoabsorption cross-section of the molecule [14, 15] according to 

𝜎 ~ 𝜎𝐻(𝑍∗) (1 +

sin(𝑘𝑅)
𝑘𝑅

), 

(3) 

where σH is the atomic photoionization cross section for an effective charge Z* and k is the 

electron wave-vector. In single photon double ionization, as demonstrated in [12], a 

corresponding dependence is observable in the sum momentum of the two emitted electrons. The 

measured |Ψ(R)|² has been corrected correspondingly, applying a mean sum momentum kmean of 

2.9 a.u.. Despite this inconvenience, single photon double ionization induced by soft X-ray 

synchrotron light is far superior to e.g. laser-based sequential double ionization for triggering a 

Coulomb explosion, as it is instantaneous on the time scale relevant for nuclear motion. This is 

5 

 
 
 
 
especially vital for light systems with steep potential energy surfaces of the intermediate singly 

charged ionic state, as for example H2

+.  

Figure 1 shows the results of our measurement and the application of Eq. (1) to the measured 

data in order to obtain V(R). A binding energy D0 = 4.478 eV [16] of the hydrogen molecule was 

assumed. After adjusting the measured KER values by 3%, the measured potential shows 

excellent agreement with the calculated potential energy curve [17]. Furthermore, the measured 

potential allows, for example, to extract the depths of the potential De and the equilibrium 

distance Re. Table I presents the values obtained by fitting a Morse function to the measured H2 

potential. 

B. Van der Waals-bound systems 

The van der Waals-bound systems have been investigated using sequential tunnel ionization 

induced by a strong ultrashort laser pulse (Ti:Sa laser, Dragon KMLabs, 780 nm, 40 fs) in order 

to initiate the Coulomb explosion (see [18, 19] for a discussion of the influence of nuclear 

motion during the laser pulse). Also in this case we account for an R-dependence of the 

ionization rate. The ionization probability of tunnel ionization depends on the effective principal 

quantum number n* which factors in the ionization potential and, for the second ionization step, 

the kinetic energy released in the Coulomb explosion [20]:

depends on the electric field of the laser F and the charge of the remaining ion Z, with 

D = (4eZ3/Fn*4)n*. Since the KER depends on the distance of the atoms at the instant of 

ionization (see Eq. (2)), the tunnel ionization probability ωADK shows a corresponding 

dependency. Therefore, the distribution of R obtained in the measurement is not equal to the 

square of the vibrational wave function of the system, but equals the square of the wave function 

multiplied by tunnel ionization probabilities according to Eq. (5). The influence of this 

dependency can be substantial as Figs. 3 and 4 reveal. The peak intensity of the laser in the 

focus, which is needed when evaluating Eq. (5), was estimated by inspecting the ratio of the 

single ionization of monomers to the double ionization of dimers, after considering the detector 

efficiency of 0.6 and the fraction of dimers in the supersonic gas jet (1 % for Ne2 and 5 % for 

Ar2). This results in a laser peak intensity of 2.3∙1014 W/cm² and 8.2∙1013 W/cm² in the Ne2 and 

Ar2 experiments, respectively. The measurement of He2 was conducted at a higher laser 

intensity, saturating the helium single ionization probability. Accordingly, the dependence of Eq. 

5 on the KER can be neglected in this case. The measurement of the KER requires a careful 

calibration of the COLTRIMS reaction microscope. This calibration was done by resolving 

vibrational features occurring in the double ionization of O2 and comparing them to a 

measurement of Lundqvist et al. [21]. This results in an KER uncertainty of less than 1%. 

From the measured square of the wave function we extracted the interaction potential V(R) using 

Eq. (1). Obviously, this requires to analyze the second derivative of the wave function Ψ which 

needs to be computed numerically from the experimental data. This procedure is susceptible to 

statistical fluctuations, especially on the edges of the potential well where the wave function and 

7 

 
 
thus our signal vanishes. To reduce this influence, the curvature was calculated including five 

adjacent data points instead of the minimal required three in case of the Ne2 and the Ar2 

measurements. 

Figures 2, 3, and 4 show our results for the squares of the wave functions and for the potentials 

of He2, Ne2 and Ar2 respectively. For Ar2 we used a binding energy of 10.5 meV [22], for Ne2 a 

binding energy of 2.09 meV [23]. For He2 the binding energy of 0.15 µeV obtained from the 

measured wave function itself [1] is negligible on the scale of the figure. 

The same quality of agreement between the predicted potential and our measurement as in the H2 

case is reached for He2 comparing the experimental results to theoretical calculations by 

Przybytek et al. [24]. For the Ne2 case our measured potentials show excellent agreement with 

the calculations reported in [25]. We note that there are more than three orders of magnitude 

between the depth of the potentials of He2 and H2 demonstrating the versatility of our approach. 

Only for Ar2 a deviation from the theoretically modelled curve [22] remains, even after 

correcting for the R-dependence of the ionization probability. We attribute this to a systematical 

problem of this correction, as good agreement is obtained by assuming a lower ionization 

intensity (i.e. altering the ionization probabilities). For internuclear distances larger than 9 a.u. 

the measured potential energy curve of Ar2 is lower than theory predicts. In fact, it converges to 

the value of the binding energy E. The reason for this is that the first term on the right-hand side 

of Eq. (1) converges to zero for larger interatomic distances in our analysis, but not to the 

theoretical value of –E. This shortcoming is most likely due to the low statistics of the measured 

square of the wave function at large interatomic distances. The same can be seen for Ne2.

which result from fitting Lennard-Jones functions to the rare gas dimer potentials and compares 

them to theory values. 

Conclusion 

We demonstrate the extraction of the interaction potential of diatomic systems from Coulomb 

explosion imaging data recorded by a COLTRIMS reaction microscope. By employing an 

ionization process which is independent of the internuclear distance of the diatomic system, or 

which has a well-known dependency, the square of its wave function can be imaged. The wave 

function, along with the binding energy of the system, can be inserted into the Schrödinger 

equation, resulting in an elegant way to determine the potential V(R) over the full range of 

internuclear distances present in the system.
