Abstract

Understanding the nature of the interface between a biomaterial implant and

the biological ﬂuid is an essential step towards creating improved implant ma-

terials. This study examined a Diamond-like Carbon coating biomaterial, the

surface energy of which was modiﬁed by Ar+ ion sputtering and laser graphi-

tisation. The arrangement of proteins was analysed by angle resolved X-Ray

photoelectron spectroscopy, and the eﬀects of the polar component of surface

energy on this arrangement were observed. It was seen that polar groups (such

as CN,CO) are more attracted to the coating surface due to the stronger polar

interactions. This results in a segregation of these groups to the DLC-protein in-

terface; at increasing takeoﬀ angle (further from to DLC-protein interface) fewer

of these polar groups are seen. Correspondingly, groups that interact mainly by

dispersive forces (CC, CH) were found to increase in intensity as takeoﬀ angle

increased, indicating they are segregated away from the DLC-protein interface.

The magnitude of the segregation was seen to increase with increasing polar

surface energy, this was attributed to an increased net attraction between the
solid surface and polar groups at higher polar surface energy (γp

S).

1. Introduction

The use of medical implants drives the need understand the interactions that

are taking place at the interface between biological ﬂuid and implant materi-

als. Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) coatings are commonly applied as coatings

on arterial stents [1], and in this application in particular, the interactions at

the interface are of key importance. This is due to adsorption of proteins - a

commonplace phenomenon that occurs when an implant material is introduced,

and in some cases this can lead to thrombus formation and embolism (formation

of blood clots that can block blood vessels and cause tissue death) [2]. Under-

standing the nature of the interface and the initial protein layer is therefore an

important step towards developing superior and safer implant materials.

The adsorption of BSA (Bovine Serum Albumen) onto stainless steel sur-

faces has been widely studied [3–5], with results showing signiﬁcant interactions

between the protein and the surface. These interactions result in conforma-

tional and structural changes of the protein, and even migration of surface

species. There have been few XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) stud-

ies on protein adsorption onto DLC surfaces, however Ahmed et al.

[6] found

that increased Si doping increases sp3 content, as well as decreasing adsorption.

These results suggest that surface chemistry has a strong eﬀect on both the

overall adsorption, as well as the structure of the adsorbed layer. In addition,

it is known that upon adsorption, protein molecules are likely to undergo con-

formational changes and denaturation [7], however what these changes are has

not yet been identiﬁed for DLC coatings.

The polar component of surface energy appears to be the major contribu-

tor to the amount of protein adsorption [7–9]. However, the arrangement of

this initial protein layer, and the eﬀects of surface energy on this, has not been

comprehensively studied. The lack of information in this area appears to be

a common trend in the study of protein adsorption to surfaces, with Silva-

2

Bermudez and Rodil identifying that more work need to be done to correlate

the properties of the surface to protein adsorption mechanisms [7]. Studies by

Browne et al. and Baio et al.

[10, 11] of protein adsorption onto polystyrene

and calcium phosphate surfaces shows that adsorption of protein can be sig-

niﬁcantly aﬀected by substrate surface chemistry, and it is suggested that the

changes in adsorption behaviour seen require a change in conformation of the

protein molecule. Feng et al. [8] found that protein adsorption depended mainly

on the polar component of surface energy and the hydroxyl groups, but there

has been no investigation into whether this interaction causes a change in the

arrangement of the adsorbed protein. In the present study, the arrangement

of diﬀerent protein functional groups adsorbed onto a DLC surface was investi-

gated, and the eﬀect of the polar surface energy component on this arrangement

was analysed.

Studies on protein adsorption on DLCs have also shown that the sp2/sp3

bonding ratio in the DLC material has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the haemocompat-

ibility of the surface, with increasing sp3 content increasing adsorption of Human

Serum Albumin relative to Fibrinogen [12]. Therefore in this study the sp2/sp3

bonding ratio was altered by surface treatments (speciﬁcally Ar+ ion sputter-

ing and laser graphitisation) in order to observe the eﬀect on protein adsorption.

In order to examine the arrangement of proteins on the biomaterial surface,

a protein layer was adsorbed onto the surface of the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed

DLC coatings. BSA was used as it is often used as a model for protein adsorption

from blood [13], as well as being a well-characterised protein that is often used

to study protein interactions with solid surfaces [14]. This allows the present

study to be relevant for applications involving interactions of blood with DLCs

such as arterial stents.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Diamond-like Carbons

Diamond-like carbons (DLCs) are a form of amorphous carbon, with a mix-

ture of both sp2 and sp3 bonded carbon. The properties of the DLC coating

are heavily dependent on this sp2 to sp3 bonding ratio [15]. In this work, Ar+

ion sputtering and laser graphitisation are used to graphitise the surface of the

DLC coatings, that is, to convert some of the sp3 bonded carbon to sp2; the

form found in graphite.

The diamond-like carbon coating used was a DLC coating with metallic

interlayers to improve adhesion to the substrate, and was deposited by a com-

bination of PACVD (Plasma Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition) and PVD

(Physical Vapour Deposition) methods.

2.2. Ar+ Ion Sputtering

Ar+ ion sputtering was carried out to induce surface graphitisation of DLC

coatings, using the method developed by Viljoen et. al.

[16]. The ion beam

used was the Kratos Minibeam III (an accessory technique to the Kratos Axis

ultraDLD XPS - see below). Samples were prepared in the same way as for

XPS. For ion sputtering, the chamber pressure of the XPS was slightly higher

than usual (1.5x10-7 Torr), due to the presence of the sputtering gas. The ion

beam energy was 5.2 keV with an emission current of 6mA. The raster size was

adjusted to 3x3mm, and the ion beam turned on for 4 minutes.

In order to

graphitise a larger area, the raster square was moved to several diﬀerent posi-

tions on the sample rather than increasing the area (which would give a lower

emission current density, seen by trials to result in non-optimal graphitisation).

To ensure that any changes in surface chemistry seen were a result of ac-

tual changes in the DLC coating (rather than just removal of adsorbed species),

the sputtered DLC was exposed to atmosphere for 10 minutes, before being re-

analysed. If the changes seen are simply due to removal of adsorbed species, we

4

would expect to see the C1s peak shift back to the higher binding energy asso-

ciated with sp3 carbon after exposure to air, as adsorbed species (adventitious

carbon) are usually of the sp3 conﬁguration [17]. However if an actual change

in surface chemistry is achieved there should be little change in the C1s peak

after exposure to air - it should remain at the lower binding energy associated

with sp2 (graphitised) carbon.

2.3. Laser Graphitisation

Laser graphitisation experiments were carried out using a femtosecond laser

micromachining system based on a Ti:Sapphire ampliﬁed femtosecond laser

(Mantis (oscillator) and Legend Elite (ampliﬁer), Coherent Inc., USA); simi-

lar to the method used by Dumitru et. al.

[18]. This laser supplies 800 nm

wavelength, ultrashort (100 fs) pulses at a repetition rate of 500Hz to a JPSA

IX-100 micromachining platform under atmospheric conditions. The laser was

set up to produce a square spot (50x50 µm) with an energy density of 1.28

J/cm2. Beam attenuation was set to 69% (using a waveplate and polariser vari-

able attenuator) to give the desired energy density of 0.4 J/cm2 to compare with

the work of Dumitru et. al. The micromachining platform was programmed to

scan and ﬁre across the whole sample surface, resulting in a uniformly laser

treated surface.

2.4. Protein Adsorption

A 1mg/mL BSA solution was prepared by dissolving BSA powder into dis-

tilled water. The solution was be prepared immediately before the adsorption

test, and then analysed without delay, to prevent degradation of the protein.

The sample was immersed in 20 mL of BSA solution in a plastic vial, unagitated

at room temperature, for 60 minutes. After immersion the sample was rinsed

with distilled water to remove any solution that may have dried on the surface

(not adsorbed).

5

2.5. Analysis Methods

XPS was carried out on a Kratos Axis ultraDLD, using a monochromated

Al Kα X-Ray source with a power of 150 W. The chamber pressure was approx-

imately 1.5x10-7 Torr. Survey scans were performed at pass energy of 160 eV

from 0 to 1350 eV, while core level scans were carried out at 20 eV to improve

resolution. Angle Resolved XPS was used to alter the analysis depth for analy-

sis of protein arrangment - a higher take-oﬀ angle results in a smaller analysis

depth. Take-oﬀ angles of 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80◦ were used to produce a depth

proﬁle of the surface (take-oﬀ angle is deﬁned here as the angle between the

collection angle and surface normal).

Peak ﬁtting was carried out using CasaXPS software, ﬁtting with a Shirley-

type background and Gauss-Lorentz component peak shapes. Graphitic (sp2)

carbon was ﬁtted with the Doniach-Sunjic asymmetry known to be character-

istic of graphite [19]. Components were ﬁtted so that peak widths remained

similar for all components. The sp3 and sp2 components of the DLC were ﬁtted

using two peaks at 285.4 eV and 284.8 eV respectively [1, 17].

The components of the adsorbed protein were determined from analysis of

a BSA standard sample. Samples were cleaned with isopropanol and air dried

before analysis to remove surface contaminants (for samples with adsorbed pro-

teins distilled water was used instead), and six repeats were carried out for all

samples to ensure reliability and repeatability of data. Charge neutralisation

was used for the BSA protein standard, which was prepared by evaporating BSA

solution (1mg/mL) in a gold-coated sample stub. The sp2 carbon component

at 284.8 eV was used as a binding energy reference.

Scanning Electron Microscopy was carried out using a Phillips FEI XL30S,

with a Field Emission Gun (FEG) electron source. The imaging parameters

such as accelerating voltage are seen in the information bar on the image.

6

The surface energy of treated and untreated DLCs were calculated from

measurements of contact angles of di - iodomethane and water, a polar and

non-polar ﬂuid. Prior to measurement, samples were cleaned with ethanol and

distilled water. The instrument used was a KSV CAM 101 goniometer, using

the sessile drop technique, where a drop of the probe liquid is dropped onto the

surface and the contact angle of this drop with the surface is measured. This

measurement was done by the CAM 2008 software. Between measurements,

samples were rinsed with distilled water to remove any residual ﬂuid.

The surface energy was calculated by the Owens and Wendt equation [20],

where the contact angle with two diﬀerent ﬂuids is required. The Owens and

Wendt equation is shown below, where γ is the surface energy, θ is the contact

angle, the subscripts S and L denote the solid and liquid parts of the system

respectively, and the superscripts p and d denote the polar and dispersive com-

ponents of surface energy respectively.

A summary of surface chemistry components measured by XPS is shown in

Table 1. The unmodiﬁed DLC is primarily composed of C-C bonds (sp3 and

sp2), with some CO and C=O bonds also found. After Ar+ ion sputtering,

no change was seen in the SEM image from the unmodiﬁed DLC (Figure 1),

indicating that this graphitisation had not aﬀected the surface morphology, but

only the surface chemistry. The nodular structure seen in these images is the

result of the PACVD and PVD processes used to produce the DLC coating.

A signiﬁcant change is seen in the XPS C1s spectrum after Ar+ ion sputter-

ing, as seen in Figure 2A,C,D. The main peak shifts to the right (lower binding

energy), indicating a decrease in the sp3/sp2 fraction from 0.77 to 0.19 (as the

7

sp2 component has lower binding energy than sp3). This can be explained by

the mechanism proposed by Briand et. al. [21]. The positively charged Ar+ ion

penetrates into the surface and extracts electrons from the material, creating

positive holes. On dielectric materials like DLCs, these positive holes cannot

be neutralised immediately, creating high local stresses, in turn causing surface

modiﬁcation (graphitisation). The energy (in the form of moving ions) input

into the material allows C atoms to transform to the stable graphite (sp2) struc-

ture from meta-stable (at ambient conditions) diamond sp3.

The SEM image of the laser graphitised DLC (Figure 1) shows how the laser

square has been rastered across the surface, causing a surface modiﬁcation.

The modiﬁcation is mainly graphitisation of the DLC, seen by the decrease in

sp3/sp2 ratio, but some oxidation of the surface has occured, as shown by Figure

2B - increased CO and C=O components are found, as well as the sp2 and sp3

components of the DLC. This is the result of the high temperatures generated

at the surface by the laser.

In order to ensure that any changes in surface chemistry of the Ar+ sput-

tered DLC were a result of changes in the DLC coating rather just than removal

of adsorbed species, samples were exposed to atmosphere for 10 minutes, be-

fore being re-analysed by XPS. From the XPS spectra in Figure 2D, it is easy

to see the shift in binding energy associated with graphitisation. Comparing

the two spectra before and after exposure to air, there is essentially no diﬀer-

ence, indicating that the binding energy shift from 285.4 eV to 284.8 eV (i.e.

graphitisation) seen is a result of a chemical change, rather than simply removal

of adsorbed species (as adsorbed species would be manifested as hydrocarbon

species at 285.4 eV[17]). This is veriﬁed by quantiﬁcations of the various compo-

nents of these peaks, giving an sp3/sp2 ratio of 0.77 (±0.01) before sputtering,

0.19 (±0.02) after sputtering, and 0.17 (±0.01) after exposure to air. From

survey scans we are able to quantify the oxygen composition: 6.9%(±0.4) for

the DLC, 0.6%(±0.1) after sputtering, and 2.5%(±0.2) after exposure to air.

8

This does suggest that some adsorption has taken place, however because our

analysis focuses on the C1s peak, we are most concerned with the eﬀects on

this. Figure 2D shows signiﬁcant change after sputtering, and no change after

exposure of the sputtered sample to air, so we can reasonably conclude that the

changes seen are not a result of removal of adsorbed species.

Both the unmodiﬁed DLC and the Ar+ ion sputtered DLC are seen to have

a dispersive component of surface energy that is signiﬁcantly greater than the

polar component (see Table 2),indicating that the surface is composed primar-

ily of non-polar bonds (such as C-C bonds). This agrees with the composition

already measured by XPS, where only a small polar component (5.4 - 5.5% CO

and C=O bonding for both) was found. Ar+ ion sputtering did not signiﬁcantly

alter the dispersive surface energy component, however the polar surface energy

decreases from 5.7 to 3.5 mN/m, which can only have been caused by the change

in sp3/sp2 ratio.

Laser graphitisation appreciably changes the surface energy of the DLC. The

most notable change is the increase in the polar surface energy component from

5.7 to 13.6 mN/m, due to the oxidation (which contains polar CO and C=O

bonds) caused by laser graphitisation.

Angle Resolved XPS (ARXPS) was used to characterise the DLC surfaces

as a function of depth, before BSA adsorption. Figure 3 shows the arrangement

of diﬀerent groups in the DLC coating as a function of takeoﬀ angle. The

unmodiﬁed DLC shows negligible change in the CO and C=O groups with

depth, however at higher takeoﬀ angles (i.e. more surface sensitive) the sp3

content decreases slightly. After Ar+ ion sputtering sp3 content follows the same

trend as for the unmodiﬁed DLC, albiet at a lower sp3 content to begin with.

The laser graphitised DLC shows an increasing trend for sp3, CO and C=O

groups with increasing takeoﬀ angle. This trend is uncertain however, as SPM

(Scanning Probe Microscopy) showed that laser graphitisation resulted in an

9

increased surface roughness, with a variation in the z-direction of >200nm, hence

it cannot be veriﬁed that this is an actual trend rather than a surface roughness

eﬀect. Because of the uncertainty introduced by this surface roughness, we have

removed the laser graphitised DLC from our analysis from this point forward.

3.2. Protein Overlayer

To establish the functional groups present and their relative proportions, a

standard sample with BSA adsorbed onto a gold-coated sample stub was anal-

ysed. The C1s spectrum was ﬁtted with three peaks corresponding to common

protein functional groups: CC/CH at 285.4eV (equivalent to sp3 bonded car-

bon), CO/CN at 286.7eV, and COOH/CONH at 288.6eV. These are consistent

with literature [3, 17] and are shown in Table 3 and Figure 4.

From the XPS spectra of BSA adsorbed onto DLC surfaces, four diﬀerent

components could be deconvoluted from within the C1s envelope:

• sp2 at 284.8 eV, from the DLC only

• sp3/CC/CH at 285.4 eV, from the DLC and CC/CH bonds in the protein

• CO/CN at 286.7 eV, from CO bonds in the DLC and CO/CN bonds in

the protein

• C=O/COOH/CONH at 288.6 eV, from C=O bonds in the DLC and

COOH/CONH bonds in the protein

The relative proportions of the diﬀerent functional groups are consistent with

published data on the relative proportions of these groups in the bulk protein

[22, 23]. This indicates that the protein on the gold surface has not segregated

and the values shown in Table 3 can be taken as indicative of the bulk BSA.

In order to analyse the protein arrangement, the XPS signal from the BSA

was deconvoluted from the combined signal that contains both the BSA over-

layer and the underlying DLC. The depth proﬁles of the modiﬁed and unmod-

iﬁed DLCs (before BSA adsorption) were used to characterise the amounts of

10

diﬀerent chemical groups (i.e. sp3, CO and C=O) relative to sp2. The sp2 car-

bon was used as a reference as it is the only carbon component that is present

in the DLC but not in the protein overlayer. From these depth proﬁles it was

possible to calculate the amount of sp3, CO, and C=O carbon relative to sp2

for each DLC as a function of analysis depth (in terms of inelastic mean free

path λIM F P ).

The depth of the protein overlayer (assuming formation of a homogeneous

overlayer) was then estimated using the Strohmeier equation, where N repre-

sents the volume density of atoms, I represents the intensity (peak area), and

the subscripts s and o indicate the substrate and overlayer respectively:

d = λo cos Θ ln

NoλoIs

(cid:21)

+ 1

(2)

For each of the DLC surfaces analysed, the protein overlayer thickness (see

Table 1) was found to be of the order of the inelastic mean free path (48.32˚A

[24]). These values are similar the 35˚A ±8 measured by Frateur et al.

[25]

by EQCM. The protein layer adsorbed onto the untreated DLC surface is sig-

niﬁcantly thicker than that on the Ar+ ion sputtered DLC though, which is

thought to be a result of the larger polar surface energy component (see Table

2) increasing the bonding between substrate and protein, as seen in multiple

other studies [7–9]. The BSA protein itself has approximate dimensions of a

40 x 40 x 140˚A spheroid, [22, 26, 27] therefore these thickness measurements

indicate that adsorption has taken place in the form of a monolayer, oriented

side-on (long axis parallel to the surface).

The fact that the layer thickness and inelestic mean free path are of sim-

ilar magnitude means that the signal from the underlying DLC will originate

from the very near surface of the DLC (i.e. close to the DLC-protein interface)

and have the corresponding composition as measured by depth proﬁling of the

DLC surface before protein adsorption. This known composition of the DLC

(in terms of the amounts of sp3, CO and C=O carbon relative to sp2) was sub-

11

tracted from the signal obtained (again normalised to sp2), to determine the

signal from the BSA alone. Shown in Figure 5 is an example of the XPS C1s

spectrum of BSA adsorbed onto one of the DLC surfaces. Overlays of the DLC,

DLC with adsorbed BSA, and BSA only C1s spectrums are also shown here, to

demonstrate the change seen on adsorption of BSA, and how this relates to the

composition of the pure BSA.

After subtracting the signal from the underlying DLC, the arrangment of

the adsorbed protein overlayer could be analysed - this is shown in the protein

arrangement graphs (Figure 6) showing the composition of the BSA overlayer

as a function of depth. Both the unmodiﬁed DLC and the Ar+ ion sputtered

DLC display a greater proportion of sp3 carbon than the bulk BSA (42%, see

Table 3), which indicates that these CC/CH bonds are facing outwards - away

from the substrate-protein interface.

For the unmodiﬁed DLC, the relative amount of CO/CN carbon increases

(with a corresponding decrease in the CC/CH group) as the analysis depth in-

creases, indicating that the CO/CN groups are slightly segregated towards the

protein - DLC interface. This is consistent with the trend seen by Premathilaka

[28] in ARXPS studies of whey protein adsorption, even though these use a

diﬀerent protein at a higher temperature of 7◦C. This same trend is observed

in the Ar+ ion sputtered DLC, which shows a much larger change in relative

amounts of the CC/CH and CO/CN groups with depth - CC/CH decreases

with increasing analysis depth, while the CO/CN group increases. One notable

diﬀerence between the protein adsorbed onto the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed DLC

substrates is the proﬁle of these changes. As analysis depth increases (i.e. take-

oﬀ angle decreases), for the Ar+ ion sputtered DLC the increase in the CO/CN

group (and the corresponding decrease in the CC/CH group) begins earlier than

for the unmodiﬁed DLC. This is a consequence of the decreased thickness of the

protein layer on the Ar+ ion sputtered DLC compared to the unmodiﬁed DLC

(see Table 1, which allows stronger signals from the groups located closer to the

12

DLC-protein interface at higher takeoﬀ angles.

The important role of CO/CN groups in bonding between the DLC surface

and protein layer is due to the increased strength of polar interactions compared

to the much weaker dispersive interactions experienced by CC/CH groups. The

COOH/CONH group, on the other hand, does not change with analysis depth

for any of the three samples - implying that it may not have much contribution

to bonding between the adsorbed BSA and the surface. This is probably due

to the larger size of these groups, making it more diﬃcult for them to change

orientation and participate in bonding.

It is particularly interesting to observe the relationship between the segre-

gations observed here, and the surface energies measured. Figure 7 shows the

magnitude of the segregation of the non-polar CC/CH group (in terms of the

change in composition between the bulk BSA and the adsorbed BSA at 80◦
takeoﬀ angle) as a function of the polar component of suface energy (γp

S). It
has previously been shown [8] that the polar component of surface energy is
the dominant factor in adsorption of BSA onto solid surfaces - as γp

S increases,
adsorption increases. The results here support this, and demonstrate that due

to the important role polar groups (CO/CN, COOH/CONH) play in bonding,

non-polar CC/CH groups are segregated away from the interface. When the po-

lar component of surface energy is higher, segregation of BSA groups increases

- this is shown here by the increase in non-polar group (CC/CH) segregation

away from the interface.

In addition to analysing the variations in these groups with depth, we can

also discuss the signiﬁcance of their relative magnitudes. The BSA adsorbed

onto the unmodiﬁed DLC coating displays a CC/CH fraction that is consistently

0.1-0.2 higher than the Ar+ ion sputtered DLC coating (see Figure 6). This can

be attributed to the slightly diﬀerent thicknesses of the adsorbed protein layers

mentioned above. Since we have established that the proportion of CC/CH

13

bonded carbon decreases as we move down the protein layer towards to DLC-

protein interface, it follows that the XPS signal from a thicker protein layer will

contain a higher proportion of carbon in this conﬁguration. This explains the

diﬀerence between the baseline CC/CH concentrations of the DLC and Ar+ ion

sputtered DLC.

4. Conclusions

Signiﬁcant changes in the surface chemistry of the DLC coatings were achieved

after modiﬁcation. Laser graphitisation was seen to increase the amount of CO

and C=O groups on the DLC surface, leading to an increase in the polar com-

ponent of surface energy. Ar+ ion sputtering decreased the amount of CO and

C=O groups, leading to a corresponding decrease in the polar component of

surface energy.

Angle Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARXPS) of the adsorbed

BSA layer shows that polar groups (i.e. CO/CN) are segregated towards the

DLC-protein interface - this is due to their important role in bonding.

It is

known that the polar component of surface energy aﬀects protein adsorption
onto solid surfaces, with a higher γp
has shown that an increased γp

S resulting in higher adsorption. This study
S also results in a greater degree of segregation of
the polar CO/CN groups involved in bonding, presumably a result of increased

net attraction between the solid surface and polar groups at higher polar surface

energy.
