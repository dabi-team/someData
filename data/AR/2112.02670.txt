We formulate a transparent measure that quantiﬁes chirality in single electron ionization triggered
in atoms, which are achiral systems. We do so in the context of Ar driven by a new type of optical
ﬁelds that consists of two non-collinear laser beams giving rise to chirality that varies in space across
the focus of the beams. Our computations account for realistic experimental conditions. To deﬁne
this measure of chirality, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the sign of the electron ﬁnal momentum scalar triple product
pk · (pi × pj) and multiply it with the probability for an electron to ionize with certain values for
both pk and pipj. Then, we integrate this product over all values of pk and pipj. We show this to
be a robust measure of chirality in electron ionization triggered by globally chiral electric ﬁelds.

Ultrafast phenomena in chiral molecules triggered by
intense, infrared laser pulses are at the forefront of laser-
matter interactions [1–5]. While ultrafast chiral processes
can be studied using high harmonic generation (HHG)
[1, 6–10], the underlying recollision mechanism entails
that a stronger chiral response comes at the expense of
a greatly suppressed high harmonic signal [1]. Hence,
photoelectron spectroscopy is a promising route to a ro-
bust signal from molecules driven by intense chiral ﬁelds
[2, 3, 5, 11–13]. However, the sensitivity of chiral pho-
toelectron spectroscopy also struggles with the fact that
laser wavelengths are several orders of magnitude larger
than the molecular dimensions, i.e., the chiralities of the
optical ﬁeld and the molecule are incommensurate.

Recently, Ayuso et al. proposed a new type of optical
ﬁeld which is chiral on the atomic scale [6] and thereby
holds the potential for unprecedented chiral sensitivity.
The chiral ﬁeld is synthesized by combining two orthog-
onally polarized two-color laser ﬁelds in a non-collinear
geometry as illustrated in Fig. 1. The non-collinear ge-
ometry creates an intensity and ellipticity grating, and
thereby causes the chirality of the laser ﬁeld to spatially
vary across the focus. Thus, it is a fundamental challenge
for experiments to decipher the signatures of chirality in
the photoelectron spectra from these new laser ﬁelds.

Here, we provide a simple prescription on how to an-
alyze experimental photoelectron spectra produced from
any type of chiral light. To this end, we perform semi-
classical simulations of strong-ﬁeld ionization, taking into
account the focal volume distribution of the degree of
light chirality. To develop an understanding of chiral elec-
tron ionization we model atomic photoionization, since
ground-state atoms have spherical symmetry and are in-
trinsically achiral systems. Thus, the chiral response of
the escaping electron that is imprinted on the ionization
spectra in our model arises solely from the dynamics trig-
gered by the electric ﬁeld of the laser.

In order to analyze the resulting photoelectron spectra
we identify a transparent measure that quantiﬁes chi-

consisting of ω-2ω orthogonally polarized linear ﬁelds; ω is po-
larized on the x-y plane and 2ω along the z-axis. Both beams
propagate towards the atom in the focus region (red-shaded
ellipse). The resultant electric ﬁeld has chirality (square in-
set) that changes along the x-axis in the focus region.

rality in electron ionization dynamics ensuing from an
atom strongly-driven by a chiral electric ﬁeld. We con-
struct this measure by ﬁnding the probability P(pk, pipj)
for an electron to ionize with certain values for both pk
and pipj, with pi,pj,pk being the components of the ﬁnal
electron momentum. Next, we multiply this probabil-
ity by the sign of the momentum scalar triple product
pk · (pi × pj). Integrating over the whole range of values
of pk and pipj, we obtain a measure of chirality

X (pk, pipj) =
(cid:90) (cid:90)

sign(pk · (pi × pj))P(pk, pipj)dpipjdpk.

We show that X has an opposite sign for synthetic pulses
with opposite chirality, while it is zero for achiral syn-
thetic pulses. This measure of handedness of electron
ionization dynamics is a general one and accounts for

We demonstrate that X is a measure of handedness of
electron ionization dynamics ensuing from atoms, in the
context of Ar driven by two non-collinear laser beams,
see Fig. 1. Beams 1, 2 propagate on the x-y plane with
wavevectors k1, k2 forming an angle α with the y axis

k1 = k sin(α)ˆx + k cos(α)ˆy
k2 = −k sin(α)ˆx + k cos(α)ˆy,

(2)

where k = 2π/λ. The electric ﬁeld of each beam consists
of two orthogonally polarized ω and 2ω laser ﬁelds. The
ω ﬁeld is polarized along the x-y plane and the 2ω ﬁeld
is polarized along the z-axis. Also, we take the 2ω ﬁeld
to have small intensity compared to the ω ﬁeld.

We note that τ = 25 fs and τ (cid:112)2 ln(2) is the full
width at half maximum of the pulse duration in inten-
sity, while E0 is the ﬁeld strength corresponding to inten-
sity 5 × 1013 W/cm2. Also, ρ is the radial distance to the
propagation axis of each laser beam. Since α is small, 5◦,
x2 + z2. Moreover, w0 = 8.49 µm is
it follows that ρ ≈
the beam waist of the ω laser ﬁeld, and r2
0 is the intensity
ratio of 1/100 of the 2ω versus the ω ﬁeld. Finally, the
wavelength λ of the ω ﬁeld is taken equal to 800 nm.

We treat single electron ionization of driven Ar by em-
ploying a three-dimensional (3D) semi-classical model.
The only approximation is the initial state. One electron
tunnel-ionizes through the ﬁeld-lowered Coulomb-barrier
at time t0. To compute the tunnel-ionization rate, we em-
ploy the quantum mechanical Ammosov-Delone-Krainov
(ADK) formula [14, 15]. We use parabolic coordinates
to obtain the exit point of the tunneling electron along

2

the laser-ﬁeld direction [16]. We set the electron mo-
mentum along the laser ﬁeld equal to zero, while we
obtain the transverse momentum by a Gaussian distri-
bution [14, 15]. The microcanonical distribution is em-
ployed to describe the initial state of the initially bound
electron [17].

We select the tunnel-ionization time, t0, randomly in
the time interval [-2τ ,2τ ]. Next, we specify at time t0
the initial conditions for both electrons. Using the three-
body Hamiltonian of the two electrons with the nucleus
kept ﬁxed, we propagate classically in time the position
and momentum of each electron. All Coulomb forces and
the interaction of each electron with the electric ﬁeld in
Eq. (3) are fully accounted for with no approximation.
To account for the Coulomb singularity, we employ reg-
ularized coordinates [18]. Here, we use atomic units.

Previous successes of this model include identifying the
mechanism underlying the ﬁngerlike structure in the cor-
related electron momenta for He driven by 800 nm laser
ﬁelds [19], see also [20–22]. Moreover, we investigated the
direct versus the delayed pathway of non-sequential dou-
ble ionization for He driven by a 400 nm, long duration
laser pulse and achieved excellent agreement with fully
ab-initio quantum mechanical calculations [23]. Also, for
low intensities, we have identiﬁed a novel mechanism of
double ionization, namely, slingshot non-sequential dou-
ble ionization [24]. In addition, for several observables of
non-sequential double ionization, our results have good
agreement with experimental results for Ar when driven
by near-single-cycle laser pulses at 800 nm [25].

It was previously shown [6] that the resultant electric
ﬁeld is globally chiral if the relative phases of the ω and
2ω laser ﬁelds in beams 1 and 2, i.e. φ2ω

To illustrate that X is a measure of chirality in electron
ionization of driven atoms, we perform six independent
studies. Each study corresponds to Ar being driven by
one of six diﬀerent resultant electric ﬁelds corresponding
to six diﬀerent synthetic pulses. For simplicity, we refer
to the resultant electric ﬁeld of the synthetic pulse as
electric ﬁeld. Each of the six synthetic pulses (cases 1-6)
corresponds to a diﬀerent combination of φ2ω
1 and

φ2ω
2 for beams 1 and 2, respectively, see Fig. 2(a).
Using the conditions in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), we select
four globally chiral electric ﬁelds, cases 1,2,4,5, and two
globally achiral ﬁelds, cases 3, 6, see Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(b),
we show that the electric ﬁelds which are globally chiral
maintain the same handedness along the x-axis in the
focus region. That is, Ey(x)/Ex(x) and Ez(x) change sign
at the same points in space x. As a result, electric ﬁelds 1
and 4 have the same chirality (+) in Fig. 2(b) and electric

FIG. 3. Probability distribution Pm(px, pypz) for the elec-
tron to ionize with momenta px and pypz, with m=1,2,3 for
electric ﬁelds 1,2,3, respectively. The sign in each quadrant
corresponds to the sign of px · (py × pz) in this quadrant.

tron ionization spectra are obtained using at least 107
singly ionizing trajectories.
In Fig. 3, we plot

the probability distribution
Pm(px, pypz) for an electron to singly ionize with mo-
menta px and pypz for the globally chiral 1, 2 and glob-
ally achiral 3 electric ﬁelds.
In each quadrant we as-
sign the sign resulting from the scalar triple product
px · (py × pz). Next, using Eq. (1), we compute the mea-
sure of chirality in electron ionization X (px, pypz). We
ﬁnd it to be equal to 1.8 × 10−2, −1.9 × 10−2, −0.1 × 10−2
for electric ﬁelds 1,2,3, respectively. Indeed, a close in-
spection of Fig. 3 for case 1 reveals that the probabil-
ity distribution of the electron momenta px and pypz
has larger values at the ﬁrst and third quadrants, where
px · (py × pz) has a + sign. It follows that X has a pos-
itive value when Ar is driven by synthetic pulse 1.
In
contrast, in Fig. 3 for case 2 the probability distribution
of the electron momenta px and pypz has larger values
at the second and fourth quadrants, where px · (py × pz)
has a - sign. Hence, X has a negative value for case 2.
The opposite signs of X when Ar is driven by electric
ﬁelds 1 and 2 are consistent with the opposite chirality
of these ﬁelds. Moreover, |X | is roughly the same for
cases 1 and 2. The small oﬀset is due to the statistical
error introduced in our computations from the number
of single ionization events considered. This is also sup-
ported by X being equal to −0.1 × 10−2, instead of zero,
when Ar is driven by the achiral ﬁeld 3.

Very interestingly, we ﬁnd that all three measures of
chirality X (px, pypz), X (py, pzpx) and X (pz, pxpy) have
the same values for electric ﬁeld 1, 2 and 3. That is, all
three measures are equal to 1.8 × 10−2 for electric ﬁeld 1,
equal to -1.9 × 10−2 for ﬁeld 2 and equal to -0.1 × 10−2
for ﬁeld 3, see Table I. The same is true for all three
measures of chirality X when Ar is driven by synthetic
pulses 4,5,6. Indeed, all three X are equal to 1.×10−2 for

collinear beams; (b) change of sign of Ey(x)/Ex(x) (black) and
Ez(x) (blue) along the x-axis in the focus region, at y=z=0,
t=T/50. Cases 1,2 correspond to globally chiral electric ﬁelds
with opposite handedness, the same holds for cases 4 and 5.
Cases 3 and 6 correspond to globally achiral electric ﬁelds.

ﬁelds 2 and 5 have the same chirality (-) in Fig. 2(b). It
follows that the pairs of electric ﬁelds (1,2) and (4,5) have
opposite chirality. Also, when Ey(x)/Ex(x) and Ez(x)
change sign at diﬀerent points in space x as deﬁned by
Eq. (7), the chirality of the electric ﬁeld ﬂips sign along
the x-axis in the focus region. Hence, the electric ﬁeld
has no overall chirality. This is the case for the globally
achiral ﬁelds 3 and 6 shown in Fig. 2(b).

Next, we describe how we obtain the electron ioniza-
tion spectra of Ar for each of the six synthetic pulses
(cases 1-6). For simplicity, for each case, we set φω
2 = 0.
Since only the diﬀerences φ2ω
2 are im-
portant, there is no loss of generality. Moreover, for each
of the six synthetic pulses, to simulate realistic experi-
mental conditions, we select 101 equally spaced values of
the phase φω
1 in the interval [0,2π). This allows us to
account for the nucleus being at diﬀerent positions along
the x-axis in the focus region. Next, for each of the 101
values of φω
1 , we register the single ionisation events and
obtain the electron ionization spectra. Then, we aver-
age over all φω
1 values and obtain the electron spectra
Pm(px, pypz), Pm(py, pzpx) and Pm(pz, pxpy). We nor-
malize each one of these spectra to one. The m index
corresponds to the m electric ﬁeld, i.e. to case m and
ranges from 1-6. For each synthetic pulse 1-6, the elec-

electric ﬁeld 4, equal to −1.1×10−2 for electric ﬁeld 5 and
equal to -0.1 × 10−2 for electric ﬁeld 6, see Table II. The
above further corroborate that X is a robust measure of
chirality in electron ionization triggered by a chiral ﬁeld,
yielding the same value for any of the three combinations
of the components of the ﬁnal electron momentum.

values are expressed in 10−2.

Next, we outline a yet more transparent way to demon-
strate chirality in electron ionization. Namely, we plot
P m,n(pk, pipj) deﬁned as the diﬀerence of the normalized
probability distributions in the following way

P m,n(pk, pipj) = Pm(pk, pipj) − Pn(pk, pipj),

(8)

The corresponding measure of chirality is given by

X d(pk, pipj) =
(cid:90) (cid:90)

sign(pk · (pi × pj))P m,n(pk, pipj)dpipjdpk.

FIG. 4. Probability distribution P m,n(px, pypz). The m,n
indexes are 1,2 for Case 1-Case 2, 1,3 for Case 1-Case 3 and
2,3 for Case 2-Case 3. The sign in each quadrant corresponds
to the sign of px · (py × pz) in this quadrant.

In Figs. 4(a1)-4(a3), we plot the probability distribu-
tion P m,n(px, pypz) for the pair of opposite chirality elec-
tric ﬁelds (1,2), i.e. Case1-Case 2 (Fig. 4(a1)), and for
the pairs of chiral-achiral electric ﬁelds (1,3) and (2,3),
i.e. Case 1-Case 3 (Fig. 4(a2)) and Case 2-Case 3 (
Fig. 4(a3)). In each quadrant, we assign the sign result-
ing from the scalar triple product px · (py × pz). The
yellow (blue) color denotes positive (negative) values of
P m,n(px, pypz), corresponding to the electron being more
(less) probable to ionize with momenta px and pypz due
to pulse m rather than pulse n. Next, in each quadrant,
we multiply the ± sign (yellow/blue), resulting from the
distribution, with the ± sign of px · (py × pz) and then
sum up. It easily follows that the measure of chirality
X d(px, pypz) is larger and positive (3.7 × 10−2) for the
pair of opposite chirality ﬁelds (1,2), see (Fig. 4(a1)).
Also, X d is positive (1.9 × 10−2) for the pair of electric
ﬁelds (1,3) and negative (−1.8 × 10−2) for the pair (2,3),
with 1.9 × 10−2 − 1.8 × 10−2 being roughly zero, since
pulses 1 and 2 have opposite chirality. As for chirality
measures X , we ﬁnd that all three measures of chirality
X d(px, pypz), X d(py, pzpx) and X d(pz, pxpy) have the
same value for each of the ﬁelds 1,2,3, see Table II.

TABLE II. Measure of chirality X d for globally chiral electric
ﬁelds 1,2,4,5 and globally achiral ﬁelds 3,6. X d is computed
for each of the three probability distributions P m,n(px, pypz),
P m,n(py, pzpx) and P m,n(pz, pxpy). The values are expressed
in 10−2.

A similar analysis holds for the measures of chirality
in electron ionization when Ar is driven by the globally
chiral electric ﬁelds 4,5 and the globally achiral ﬁeld 6.
Indeed, in Figs. 4(b1)-4(b3), we plot the probability dis-
tribution P m,n(px, pypz) corresponding to the pair of op-
posite chirality electric ﬁelds (4,5), Case 4-Case 5, and
to the pairs of chiral-achiral pulses (4,6), Case 4-Case 6,

5

and (5,6), Case 5-Case 6. As for our results for elec-
tric ﬁelds 1,2,3, we ﬁnd that X d(px, pypz) for the pair
of opposite chirality ﬁelds (4,5) has the largest value of
2.1×10−2. Also, as expected, for the pairs (4,6) and (5,6),
we ﬁnd that X d has roughly opposite values, 1.1 × 10−2
and −1.0 × 10−2. The exact same results hold for X d
obtained for the other two combinations of momentum
components for ﬁelds 4,5,6, see Table II.

Summarizing, we identify a transparent and simple
measure of chirality in electron ionization triggered in
atoms (Ar) by synthetic pulses. These pulses can create
electric ﬁelds which are globally chiral or achiral along
the focus region. Our computations account for real-
istic experimental conditions. We deﬁne this measure
by multiplying the sign of the ﬁnal electron momentum
scalar triple product pk · (pi × pj) with the probability
for an electron to ionize with certain values for both pk

and pipj. Finally, we integrate over all values of pk and
pipj. Three such measures can be deﬁned, corresponding
to the three combinations of pk and pipj. We ﬁnd that
all three measures of chirality have the same value for a
given electric ﬁeld. This robust measure of chirality has
opposite values when the electron dynamics is triggered
by ﬁelds with opposite chirality and is zero for a globally
achiral ﬁeld. We expect that this measure of chirality in
electron ionization of atoms applies to any chiral ﬁeld.
