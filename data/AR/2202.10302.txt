ABSTRACT
We present a methodology for the use of sulphur as global metallicity tracer in galaxies, al-
lowing performing a complete abundance analysis using only the red-to-near infrared spectral
region. We have applied it to a compilation of high-quality data split into two samples: Hii
regions (DHR) in spiral and irregular galaxies, and dwarf galaxies dominated by a strong
starburst (HIIGal). Sulphur abundances have been derived by direct methods under the as-
sumption of an ionisation structure composed of two zones: an intermediate one where S++
is originated and a low ionisation one where S+ is formed. Ionisation correction factors (ICF)
have been calculated from the Ar2+/Ar3+ ratio and are shown to correlate with the hardness of
the radiation ﬁeld. Only about 10% of the objects show S3+ contributions to the total abun-
dance larger than 30%. A good correlation exists between sulphur abundance and ionising
temperature with low metallicity objects being ionised by hotter stars. No correlation is found
between ionisation parameter and total S/H abundance. Most of the HIIGal objects show S/O
ratios below the solar value and a trend for increasing S/O ratios with increasing sulphur
abundances while DHR objects show S/O ratios larger than solar and a tendency for lower
S/O ratios for higher metallicities. Finally, we present a calibration of the sulphur abundance
through the S23 parameter that remains single valued up to sulphur abundances well beyond
the solar value. S23 is independent of the ionisation parameter and only weakly dependent on
ionising temperature.

Introduction

Metals – any chemical element heavier than helium – are formed
inside stars. Therefore, it is expected that metal enrichment in the
universe started soon after the formation of the ﬁrst short-lived mas-
sive stars that promptly returned to the interstellar medium (ISM),
in explosive events, the newly synthesised chemical elements. It is
thought that these ejecta, at some point, mixed with the surround-
ing gas helping to its cooling and propitiated the appearance of a
new generation of stars, hence giving rise to the cycle of cosmic
chemical evolution.

Metals play a very important role in star formation and stellar
evolution. Amongst other things they control the cooling of the
interstellar gas, thus allowing the formation of stars; they aﬀect the
radiation transport, through the opacities involved in the diﬀerent
microscopic processes; and they have the most important role in
the dust formation and mass loss from stars. Diﬀerent chemical
element abundances can be derived from the analysis of the ionised
nebulae (Hii regions) that accompany the young, massive stellar
component in galaxies. These massive stars illuminate and ionise
cubic kilo parsec sized volumes of the ISM and hence are visible

in far away galaxies. Hii regions emit strong hydrogen and helium
recombination lines and forbidden lines from a variety of heavy
elements: O, Ne, N, S, Ar, etc., and, with appropriate constraints on
physical conditions such as the electron temperature and density of
the emitting gas, it is possible to derive ionic and total elemental
abundances and thus obtain the composition of the ISM.

Recombination lines yield the most accurate abundances be-
cause of their weak dependence on the nebular electron temperature
(in fact, helium abundances can be determined with an accuracy
higher than 5 %). But, unfortunately, most of the observed emission
lines in nebulae are collisionally excited and their intensities depend
exponentially on electron temperature which, in principle, can be
derived from appropriate line ratios of nebular to auroral lines, the
latter one being intrinsically weak and diﬃcult to detect. However,
it is possible to use the cooling properties of the ionised gas in order
to produce empirical calibrations relating the emission line intensity
ratios of nebular lines, much stronger and easily observable, with
the abundance of a given element.

Over many years oxygen has been used as the main present
abundance tracer in galaxies with star formation. In fact, it is the
oxygen abundance which is referred to when the term "metallicity"
is employed in this context. Oxygen, the most abundant element
after hydrogen and helium in Hii regions, is produced in high mass

stars (m > 8 M(cid:12)) and ejected in supernova explosions. Forbidden
collisionally excited emission lines of singly and doubly ionised
oxygen are observed in the blue-yellow region of the spectrum
([OII] 𝜆𝜆 3727,29 Å and [OIII] 𝜆𝜆 4959, 5007 Å) accessible with
conventional spectrographs from many decades back and a well
developed methodology to compute their abundances exists (see,
for example, Peimbert & Costero 1969), although this is not exempt
of problems, as we will see later.

On the other hand, the use of sulphur as an abundance tracer has
frequently been overlooked. Although less abundant than oxygen,
sulphur is also produced in massive stars and therefore its yield is
expected to follow closely that of oxygen. Nebular S/H abundances
are therefore expected to also follow those of O/H and hence the
S/O ratio should remain constant at about the solar value, log S/O (cid:39)
-1.7 (Asplund et al. 2009). Empirical tests to validate this have been
performed apparently conﬁrming the cosmic nucleosynthetic ratio
(see Berg et al. 2020, for a recent relation between S/O and O/H),
although the results of some works suggest that this relation should
be explored further, particularly at the not well sampled metallicity
ends: extremely metal deﬁcient Hii galaxies (i.e. very low O/H)
and Hii regions in the inner zones of galaxy discs (i.e. metal rich
central zones with the highest O/H abundances). It should be taken
into account that, although a certain amount of oxygen in diﬀused
clouds is depleted, this is not the case for sulphur which is almost
undepleted in the low density, ISM (Jenkins 2009; Rodríguez-Baras
et al. 2021).

The nebular emission lines of sulphur are analogous to those of
oxygen, with the singly and doubly ionised sulphur lines occurring
at longer wavelengths: [SII] at 𝜆𝜆 6716,31 Å and [SIII] at 𝜆𝜆 9069,
9532 Å, and, in principle, the same methodology can be used for
the direct derivation of its abundance, but presenting several ad-
vantages. On the theoretical side, although their intensities depend
exponentially on electron temperature, as in the case of oxygen, this
dependence is lower due to the lower energies involved in the atomic
transitions and this fact renders the lines observable even at solar
or over-solar abundances (Díaz et al. 2007). This also applies to the
[SIII] auroral line, at 𝜆 6312 Å which can be detected and measured
at, at least, solar abundances (Kinkel & Rosa 1994). Furthermore,
the region in the ionised nebula where 𝑆2+ originates practically
covers the 𝑂+ and 𝑂++ ones (see Garnett 1992) and hence the cor-
responding [SIII] electron temperature, T𝑒([SIII]), can be taken as
representative of the whole nebula. On the observational side, the
fact that the [SIII] 𝜆 6312 Å falls in a spectral region of high in-
strumental sensitivity and is weakly aﬀected by underlying stellar
population absorption, makes it possible to derive 𝑆/𝐻 by direct
methods up to solar values. Also, the lines of both [SII] and [SIII]
can be measured relative to nearby hydrogen recombination lines
(H𝛼, P9, P𝜖), thus minimising the eﬀect of any reddening and/or
calibration uncertainties. On the negative side, the strong nebu-
lar [SIII] lines shift out of the far red spectral region for redshifts
higher than 0.1. However this drawback is being overcome by the
existence of new, eﬃcient, infrared spectrographs. For instance, the
XShooter spectrograph can accommodate in the visible and the in-
frared J, H and K bands the emission lines needed to apply this
methodology minimizing sky subtraction problems for more than
106 SDSS galaxies in diﬀerent redshift ranges between 0.17 and
1.5 and presumably a good portion of these should present emis-
sion lines associated to present star formation. Observations made
with NIRSpec on board the JWST, whose spectroscopic range starts
at 6000 Å, would be able to provide data for objects with redshifts
between 0 and 4.24.

Despite the mentioned advantages, apart from the works of

Díaz & Pérez-Montero (2000); Pérez-Montero & Díaz (2005);
Kehrig et al. (2006); Díaz et al. (2007), very little attention has been
given to the [SIII] lines in the literature. Kewley & Dopita (2002)
mentioned brieﬂy the [SIII]/[SII] ratio for the estimation of the ioni-
sation parameter suggesting the existence of errors in its derivation.
They also mentioned the possibility of estimating abundances us-
ing diagnostics involving the strong sulphur lines and concluding
that: "this diagnostic does not reliably estimate abundances for any
metallicity range, and should therefore not be used". Contrary to
this, later work by Dors et al. (2011) concluded that the use the
[SIII]/[SII] vs [[OIII]/[NII] diagnostic gives O/H values nearest to
those derived from direct electron temperature methods and similar
to those resulting from the application of detailed modelling.

At any rate, as expected from the exponential dependence on
temperature of the intensities of collisionally excited lines, when the
cooling is dominated by metals the electron temperature depends
inversely on their abundance and the auroral lines become too faint
to be detected and measured. But it is possible to establish a rela-
tion between increasing metal abundance (i.e. decreasing electron
temperature) and decreasing intensity of the strong nebular lines.
Following this general idea, a plethora of so called “empirical cali-
brations” have been devised, starting with the ratio of [OIII] 𝜆 5007
Å/H𝛽 (Jensen et al. 1976), the ratio of [OIII] 𝜆 5007 Å/[NII] 𝜆 6584
Å(Alloin et al. 1979) and the ratio of ([OII]𝜆𝜆 3727,29 Å+ [OIII]
𝜆𝜆 4959,5007 Å)/H𝛽 (Pagel et al. 1979), commonly referred to as
R23. The fact that this latter index is not aﬀected by variations in
relative abundances, as is the case of [OIII]/[NII], and remains es-
sentially constant within a given giant Hii region despite variations
in excitation (Diaz et al. 1987), has made of it the most widely used
abundance calibrator. The calibration is, however, far from being
ideal due to its intrinsic two-folded nature, since, at the highest
metallicities, the high eﬃciency of the oxygen as a cooling agent
decreases the strength of the oxygen emission lines, while, at low
metallicities, the cooling is mainly exerted by hydrogen recombi-
nation lines and the oxygen line strengths increase with metallicity.
A value of of O/H (cid:39) 1.3 × 10−4 (12+log(O/H) (cid:39) 8.1) divides the
two diﬀerent abundance regimes. Although some line ratios like,
for instance [NII]/H𝛼 have been proposed in order to break this
degeneracy, the fact that a large number (up to 80 % ) of Hii regions
and star forming galaxies lie right on the turnover region is of great
concern (see e.g. Pérez-Montero & Contini 2009).

In this respect, the use of the sulphur lines allows to overcome
this caveat. Due to their nature, similar to that of the oxygen lines,
the same line of reasoning may be put forward regarding the use
of an S23 parameter deﬁned as ([SII] 𝜆𝜆 6716,31 Å+ [SIII] 𝜆𝜆
9069, 9532 Å)/H𝛽, as an alternative abundance indicator, which in
fact presents several advantages against R23: (1) due to the longer
wavelengths of the lines involved, its relevance as a cooling agent
starts at lower temperatures (higher metallicities) which makes the
relation to remain single-valued up to solar abundances, at least;
(2) their lower dependence on electron temperature, renders the
lines observable even at over-solar abundances; and (3), as stated
above, the lines of both [SII] and [SIII] can be measured relative to
nearby hydrogen recombination lines thus minimising the eﬀect of
reddening and/or calibration uncertainties. For calibration purposes
in this wavelength range, the sulphur lines can be easily scaled to
the closest hydrogen recombination lines like:

where H𝛼/H𝛽 and P9/H𝛽 are the theoretical case B recombination
ratios.

Given these properties, here we put forward a methodology for
the use of spectroscopy in the red-to-near infrared wavelength range
in order to derive physical properties and abundances of ionised
regions, including the red lines from [SIII] 𝜆 6312 Å and [SII] 𝜆
6717,31 Å in the red up to the far-red lines [SIII] 𝜆 9069,9532 Å.
These lines can a play a convenient analogue, in this wavelength
range, of the role played by the [OII] and [OIII] lines in the optical.
Among the advantages provided by this observational set up is the
much lower sensitivity to reddening eﬀects, something of especial
relevance for the study of heavily reddened star-forming objects, Hii
regions in the Milky Way through the Galactic disc or inner regions
of galaxies. Besides, most of the spectrographs being built for large
telescopes at present are optimised for the red wavelength range
(e.g. SDSS, MUSE) starting at about 4000-4800 Å which makes
worthy the eﬀort to develop methodologies adequate to this new
situation.

In the next section we present the sample of objects that we have
used here to establish a good quality sulphur abundance calibration.
Section 3 is devoted to the direct derivation of sulphur and oxygen
abundances, including the treatment of the ionisation correction
factor (ICF), not yet well established, using selected data on Hii
regions and Hii galaxies with measurements of the [SIV] infrared
line ﬂuxes, together with the predictions of photoionisation models.
In Section 4 we present the proposed empirical calibration of S/H
versus S23. Section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the results
obtained in this work and, ﬁnally, section 6 summarizes our main
conclusions.

2 Sample selection

Data obtained using CCD detectors sensitive in the red to near-
infrared spectral range started to appear in the mid 80’s. First CCDs
showed a great amount of fringing that was diﬃcult to eliminate
and required long ﬂat ﬁeld exposures. Their size was small and
therefore the spectral coverage was also small. Several diﬀerent
exposures were required in order to cover a spectral range that
would be suﬃcient to allow an adequate abundance analysis. Flux
calibration was also diﬃcult due to the lack of calibration star data
up to 1 𝜇m (Diaz et al. 1985, 1987). The night sky lines, mainly
O2 and OH lines, are very intense in the far-red spectral region
(Osterbrock & Martel 1992), and therefore a good sky subtraction
was crucial. This subtraction is better if moderate to high spectral
resolution (600 mm −1, R (cid:39) 6000) is used (Hanuschik 2003). Also,
atmospheric water absorption bands can show up very prominently.
They depend on the level of humidity and can vary through the
observing night. They can be eliminated by observing a star of
almost featureless spectrum before and after the exposure at the
same resolution (Stevenson 1994; Smette et al. 2015). Nowadays,
most of these problems have been solved and very good quality
spectra are routinely obtained (see, for example, Hägele et al. 2008).
The general sample selected for this study consists of nebulae
ionised by young massive stars residing in galaxies with diﬀerent
properties and they have been split into two. The ﬁrst sub-sample la-
belled "DHR" comprises observations of diﬀuse Giant Extragalac-
tic Hii Regions over spiral galaxy discs, including our own, and
the Magellanic Clouds. It lists 256 independent observations. The
second one, labelled HiiGal, comprises compact galaxies whose
spectra are entirely dominated by a current star formation burst
and therefore show very intense emission line spectra with large

equivalent widths and weak underlying stellar continua. This sec-
ond sub-sample lists 95 independent observations and includes the
galaxies with the lowest gas metallicities found.

Data in all the objects of the general sample have been taken
from the literature and some of them correspond to very well studied
objects (e.g. Orion nebula in the Milky Way Galaxy or 30Dor in
the Large Magellanic Cloud) which have more than one set of
data. They cover, at least, the spectral range from 𝜆 3700 Å to 𝜆
9200 Å. Moderate to high spectral resolutions have been required
for the sample selection. Also they have been required to provide
measurements of the auroral and nebular [SIII] emission lines at 𝜆
6312 Å and 𝜆 9069 Å respectively, necessary to derive [SIII] line
electron temperatures and hence provide direct determinations of
sulphur abundances. Most of the spectroscopy has been obtained
with large telescopes providing very good quality data. Details can
be found in the references listed in Tables 1 and 2 that give the
ID number of the object in column 1, some information about the
instrumentation used in column 2 and the reference to the data
source in column 3.

The spectral information from extragalactic H II regions has
been traditionally obtained from single-aperture or long-slit ob-
servations of the brightest part of the region, under the tacit as-
sumption that the observations and the derived measurements are
representative of the whole H II region, i.e. basically internal varia-
tions within the nebula are assumed to be minimal or non-existent.
López-Hernández et al. (2013) used IFS data for the centre and an
external region of M33 to test whether the description of the whole
H II region with a single value for diﬀerent parameters is valid and
studied internal gradients of the intrinsic parameters of the H II
regions for apertures or shells deﬁned according to their average
surface brightness in H𝛼. Cumulative ﬂuxes of the [SII] and [SIII]
lines for concentric individual shells turned out to be remarkly con-
stant through both the high metallicity observed region and the low
metallicity one leading to constant values of S+/H+, S++/H+ and
S/H.

The reddening corrected intensities of the emission lines of
interest for this work, relative to that of H𝛽, together with their
uncertainties, are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

3 Direct derivation of abundances

The physical conditions – electron temperatures, electron density
and abundances – for the whole sample have been recalculated
using PyNeb (Luridiana et al. 2015), based on a ﬁve-level statistical
equilibrium model, using the atomic coeﬃcients given in Table 3
of Fernández et al. (2018). According to the diﬀerent data sources
used, electron densities were determined from the [SII] 𝜆 6717Å
/ 𝜆 6731Å line ratio yielding small values, well below critical, in
most cases, therefore a value of 𝑛𝑒 = 100 𝑐𝑚−3 has been assumed
through this work.

The S++ electron temperature, 𝑇𝑒 ([𝑆𝐼 𝐼 𝐼]) has been derived
from the ratio of intensities of the nebular to auroral [SIII] lines
(𝑅𝑆3 = 𝐼 (𝜆 9069Å+𝜆 9532Å)/I(𝜆 6312Å)). Since most expressions
quoted in the literature do not apply to electron temperatures lower
than about 8000 K, too high for many disc Hii regions present in
our sample, we have used PyNeb to calculate 𝑡𝑒 ([𝑆𝐼 𝐼 𝐼]) in the
required temperature extended range. The results can be seen in
Figure 1 where it is shown how the expressions commonly used, for
example the ones given in Hägele et al. (2008) or Pérez-Montero
(2017), overestimate the electron temperature in these cases thus

Since diﬀerent ions are formed in regions of diﬀerent tempera-
tures, a certain ionisation structure for the nebula has to be assumed
in each case, which diﬀers for the objects of each sub-sample of this
study, as described below.

metallicity cases. Due to the low ionisation potential for sulphur, the
contribution by S0 can be neglected, but, on the other hand, a certain
contribution by S3+ is expected in high excitation, low metallicity,
objects which amount only to about 4% of the sub-sample.

Figure 3 shows the ionisation structure computed from a
Cloudy model (version 17.01 Ferland et al. 2017) of low density
(100 cm−3) Hii regions with half solar abundance ionised by a 5
Ma star cluster (upper panel) and a Hii galaxy of low metallicity
(Z=0.004) ionised by a young (1 Ma) star cluster of 105 M(cid:12) (lower
panel), showing the contribution by S3+. The star cluster spectral
energy distributions have been synthesised with the PopStar code
(Mollá et al. 2009). In the two cases, both S+ and S++ ions can be
seen to to overlap in a transition zone that encompasses almost the
whole nebula, a result that has also been shown, for example, by
Garnett (1992) and Pellegrini et al. (2012).

In the majority of objects of the DHR sub-sample most of the
sulphur is expected to be in the form of S+ and S++, with S++
being the dominant ionization stage, except perhaps in the highest

According to this, we have assumed an only zone in which

where I(𝜆6717Å + 𝜆6731Å) denotes the sum of the intensities of
the two red [SII] lines, I(𝜆9069Å + 𝜆9532Å) denotes the sum of the
two near infrared [SIII] lines †, I(H𝛽) denotes the H𝛽 intensity and
t𝑒([SIII]) denotes the [SIII] electron temperature in units of 10−4 K.
The derived ionic abundances, in the format 12 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑋𝑖/𝐻+), are
given in columns 2 and 3 of Tables 5 and 6 for each of the objects
in the two studied sub-samples, whose ID numbers are listed in
column 1. Column 4 of the tables gives the sum of the S+ and S++
relative to H+. which, for the objects in the DHR sub-sample, can
be taken to be the total S/H abundance, as we will see later.

On the other hand, the Hii Gal sub-sample includes a substan-
tial proportion of low metallicity and high excitation objects for
which the contribution by S3+ has to be taken into account. A direct
determination of this contribution would require the measurement
of the ﬂux from the infrared [SIV] line at 10.54 𝜇m. In the ab-
sence of these data, as is the case for most of the objects of this
sub-sample, the knowledge of ionisation correction factors (ICF) is
required. The ICF for sulphur is deﬁned as:

𝐼𝐶𝐹 (𝑆+ + 𝑆++) =

𝑆
𝐻

(cid:18) 𝑆+ + 𝑆++
𝐻+

·

(cid:19)−1

In order to calculate the individual ICF for our objects, we
have used the relation between ionic ratios of Ar and S in contigu-
ous ionisation stages: 𝐴𝑟+2/𝐴𝑟+3 vs. 𝑆2+/𝑆3+ . This relation has
been calculated using the Cloudy photoionisation grid described in
Fernández et al. (2018) and is shown in their Figure 3. The linear
ﬁtting obtained is:

The application of this alternative requires the measurement of
the [ArIII] and [ArIV] emission lines at 𝜆𝜆 7135 and 4740 Å respec-
tively. Also, the [ArIV] lines, as well as those of [SIV], originate in
a high excitation zone better characterised by the 𝑂++ temperature

measurements of the [ArIV] line exist are given in column 5 of Table
9 together with the 𝐴𝑟++/𝐻+, 𝐴𝑟3+/𝐻+,and 𝑆3+/𝑆++ ionic ratios,
in columns 2,3 and 4 respectively.

Since the ionisation of S3+ requires high energy photons, it
could be expected for the ICF to show a certain dependence on the
hardness of the ionising radiation ﬁeld. This can be mapped using
the 𝜂 parameter deﬁned by Vilchez & Pagel (1988) as:

𝜂 =

𝑂+/𝑂++
𝑆+/𝑆++

or its empirical analog:

𝜂(cid:48)

=

[𝑂𝐼 𝐼]/[𝑂𝐼 𝐼 𝐼]
[𝑆𝐼 𝐼]/[𝑆𝐼 𝐼 𝐼]

where [OII], [OIII], [SII] and [SIII] stand for the sum of the two
corresponding strong lines of each ion.

The relation between the derived ICF and 𝜂’ is shown in Figure
4 where it can be seen that the ICF has a value of 1.0, between the
uncertainties, for values of 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝜂’ larger than 0.0 (T𝑖𝑜𝑛 ≈ 38000 K)
and increases as log𝜂’ decreases according to the expression:

𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐼𝐶𝐹 − 1) = (−0.914 ± 0.064) + (−1.194 ± 0.066) · 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝜂(cid:48) (8)

We have used this empirically derived function to estimate the ICF
for the objects for which no data on the [ArIV] line exist and their
values are given in column 6 of Table 9 for the objects with ICF >
1.1.

On the other hand, data obtained by the Spitzer satellite on
the IR [SIV] and [SIII] emission lines, at 10.54 and 18.71 𝜇m
respectively, exist for some objects of our sample. Some very well
studied objects, among which are included the two lowest metallicity
observed galaxies: IZw18 and SBS0335-052E, have data from two
diﬀerent sources, which can serve to estimate the magnitude of the
internal errors in this kind of observations. From these data we have

electron temperature is well represented by T𝑒([OII]). T𝑒([OIII]) is
derived from the ratio of intensities of the nebular to auroral [OIII]
lines (𝑅𝑂3= I(𝜆4959Å + 𝜆5007Å) / I(𝜆4363Å)) as explained above,
and T𝑒([OII]) is usually derived with the help of photoionisation
models, (e. g. Stasińska 1990; Pagel et al. 1992):

𝐾

𝑇𝑒 ([𝑂𝐼 𝐼])−1 = 0.50 (cid:16)

𝑇𝑒 ([𝑂𝐼 𝐼 𝐼])−1 + 0.00008(cid:17)
Most of the oxygen is in the form of O+ and O2+, their relative
contributions depending of the degree of ionisation. Only for ex-
ceptionally high excitation objects, those that show HeII emission
at 𝜆 4686 Å, there is a small contribution by O3+ that in our case
can be neglected.

(10)

Then, the O+/H+ and O2+/H+ abundance ratios are derived
with the use of T𝑒([OII]) and T𝑒([OIII]) respectively. A detailed
description of this method, at times referred to as "the standard
method", can be found in Izotov et al. (1994). However, T𝑒([OII])
depends on density so that the relation between T𝑒([OII]) and
T𝑒([OIII]) is not straightforward (see Figure 8 of Hägele et al.
2006) and it is clear that not a simple single relation exists between
both. This is also the case when a homogeneous family of objects is
considered, as can be seen for the sample of Hii galaxies analysed
by Izotov et al. (2006). Even though the graph shown in their Figure
4 is seen to be dominated by a considerable scatter and large error
bars, most of the data with the smaller error bars fall oﬀ the rela-
tion between the temperatures assumed in the "standard method".
Therefore, the determination of O+/H+ carries a large uncertainty.
Unfortunately, O+/H+ can be of the same order as, or larger than,
O2+/H+ in low excitation nebulae, and hence the resulting total
value of the O/H abundance carries a large uncertainty for these
objects. In our case this is circumvented since the assumption of
𝑇𝑒 ([𝑂𝐼 𝐼]) (cid:39) 𝑇𝑒 ([𝑆𝐼 𝐼]) (cid:39) 𝑇𝑒 ([𝑆𝐼 𝐼 𝐼]) is made. The 𝑂+ and 𝑂++

The infrared derived ICF values for all the objects in the general
sample for which we have found suitable data (including some disc
Hii regions in M101) are listed in Table 10 and Figure 5 shows
a comparison of these IR derived values with the ones calculated
using our method, either from the A𝑟+2/Ar+3 ionic ratio or from
Eq. 8 in the case in which no data in the [ArIV] lines exist. As can
be seen, the agreement is rather good. We have therefore multiplied
those values by the derived (𝑆+ + 𝑆++)/𝐻+ ratio to obtain the total
S/H abundances which are given in column 7 of Table 9.

7 and 8 for each of the objects in the two sub-samples for which
data on the 𝜆 4363 Å line are available. The ID object numbers are

4 Empirical Calibrations

In the previous sections we have described the method to derive
sulphur and oxygen abundances by the so called "direct method" that
requires the actual determination of the gas electron temperature.
However, in many cases, the emission lines necessary to do this
are too faint to be detected, either due to the low brightness of the
objects to observe or to the strong cooling eﬀect of metals in some
of the observed regions. In order to overcome this obstacle Pagel
et al. (1979) and Alloin et al. (1979) pioneered methods to estimate
the metallicity, usually traced by the oxygen abundance, using only
strong, easily observable, emission lines.

The "strong line methods" assume that all Hii region spectra
are essentially characterised by their overall metallicity, Z. However,
other properties, mainly the hardness of the ionising radiation and
the gas ionisation degree, are intimately related with it. The former
can be inferred from the spectral energy distribution of the ionising
source and can be parametrised by the 𝜂’ parameter deﬁned in
Section 3.1 and the latter is represented by the ionisation parameter
for hydrogen which is essentially the ratio of the ionising photon
ﬂux to the gas electron density and can be deﬁned as:

𝑢 =

𝑄(𝐻)
4𝜋𝑅2 · 𝑐 · 𝑛𝑒

where Q(H) is the ﬂux of hydrogen ionising photons, R is the size
of the ionised region and n𝑒 is the gas electron density (the speed of
light,c,is included only to make the parameter dimensionless). Since
there will be a diﬀerent ionisation parameter for each volume ele-
ment at each point of the cloud, u is deﬁned at the illuminated front of
the cloud. This ionisation parameter can be adequately described by
the emission line ratio [𝑆𝐼 𝐼]𝜆𝜆6716, 6731 Å/[𝑆𝐼 𝐼 𝐼]𝜆𝜆9069, 9532
Å (Diaz et al. 1991). In fact, the three parameters: Z (as represented
by the abundance of a chosen element as oxygen or sulphur, for
example), 𝜂 (or 𝜂(cid:48)) and u are non-linearly inter-linked but the exact
nonlinear relation between them is still unknown.

Observed line ratio diagnostics are central to the whole en-
deavour of metallicity determinations, hence the large amount of

MNRAS 000, 1–18 (2021)

literature devoted to the identiﬁcation of abundance indicators and
their calibration (see, for example Pérez-Montero & Díaz 2005;
Marino et al. 2013). In fact, there are two separate and important
issues: the choice of the ideal indicator, and the proper abundance
calibration. Although a plethora of diﬀerent indicators have been
proposed, it has not yet been possible to perform their calibration
over the full range of metallicity with the necessary conﬁdence due
to a lack of data and an incomplete understanding of the physics
in the high metallicity regime (see Bresolin et al. 2004; Pilyugin
et al. 2006). The observation and measurement of the strong nebular
[SIII] lines provides an alternative metallicity calibration, similar in
nature to that of the commonly used R23, but presenting the con-
siderable advantage of remaining single-valued up to, at least, solar
abundances.

The ﬁrst comprehensive calibration of the S23 parameter was
presented in Díaz & Pérez-Montero (2000). The sample of 196
objects was rather heterogeneous and only about 30% of them had
measurements of the weak auroral [SIII] line. During the last two
decades, the number of objects with data on this line has increased
along with the data quality, as corresponds to the use of more
recent instrumentation and larger telescopes, which can improve
the resulting calibration while reducing considerably the associated
error, one of the objectives of the present work. The calibrations
of the S23 parameter in terms of the S++S++/H+ ionic ratio (upper
panel) and the total S/H abundance (lower panel) are shown in
Figure 6. Second order polynomial ﬁts yield the relations:

5 Discussion

5.1 Characteristics of the observed objects

The electron temperature of the ionised gas, given by T𝑒([SIII]),
was shown in Figure 2 above to have diﬀerent distributions for the
two studied sub-samples. The median value of T𝑒 for the disc Hii
region sample (DHR) is ∼ 7900 K while for the Hii galaxy sample
(HiiGal) is 13000 K. Since in ionised regions the cooling is exerted
by the emission lines corresponding to the diﬀerent metals, this

mostly reﬂects the diﬀerent average metallicities of the objects in
the two sub-samples. The eﬀect of sulphur ions as cooling agents
is evident by the good correlation shown between the total sulphur
abundance and the electron temperature as measured by T𝑒([SIII])
(Figure 7) and this relation is the base of the empirical calibrations
presented in Section 4 above.

Figure 8 shows the distribution of ionisation parameter and
ionising temperature, as parametrised by the [SII]/[SIII] excitation
ratio and 𝜂’ respectively, for the two sub-samples. The two of them
show rather similar distributions regarding excitation, with median
values of log([SII]/[SIII]) of -0.25 for the disc Hii region sample
(DHR) and -0.38 for the Hii galaxy sample (Hii Gal). These values
translate into ionisation parameters 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑢 of -2.56 and -2.34 accord-
ing to the calibration given in Diaz et al. (1991). The situation,
however, is very diﬀerent for the distributions of the values of the
𝜂’ parameter which are clearly diﬀerent for the two sub-samples
showing median values of 0.45 for the DHR objects and -0.36 for
the Hii Gal objects which, according to Vilchez et al. (1988), would
correspond to stellar eﬀective temperatures of about 38000 K and
55000 K (the scale being somewhat model dependent) respectively.
The similarity between the [SII]/[SIII] distributions can be justiﬁed
by selection eﬀects since the requirement of the detection of the
weak auroral [SIII] line can introduce a certain bias in both sub-
samples precluding the selection of lower ionisation parameter Hii

(upper panels) and Hii Gal (lower panels).

regions. On the other hand, the diﬀerent distribution of ionising
temperatures seems to correspond to a real eﬀect probably related
to the nature of the ionising clusters as shown in Figure 9. In fact,
Hii galaxies are characterised by their low metallicities and young
ages, while disc Hii regions show a spread of abundances up to
the solar values, and maybe beyond, and many of them are more
evolved. Both high stellar metallicities and cluster evolution would
lead to lower ionising star temperatures. Also, a diﬀerent behaviour
is shown by the objects in the two sub-samples in Figure 10 where
diagonal lines would correspond to diﬀerent values of 𝜂’ (see, for
example Hägele et al. 2008).

5.2 Abundance results

5.2.1

Ionic abundances

For both sub-samples, S++ is found to be the dominant ionisation
specie as can be seen in the right panel of Figure 11, with S++/S

for the two sub-samples, in both of them ++ seems to be the dominant ionic
specie.

𝐴𝑟+2/𝐴𝑟+3 vs. 𝑆2+/𝑆3+ which, according to photoionisation mod-
els, is found to be linear.

As mentioned in Section 3.1 above, the application of this alter-
native requires the measurement of the [ArIII] and [ArIV] emission
lines at 𝜆𝜆 7135 and 4740 Å respectively. Unfortunately, not all
published works include data on this latter line, which limits the
application of the method to a certain number of cases and can
be circumvented by using the empirical calibration for the ICF by
means of the 𝜂’ parameter as explained in Section 3.1.

For the Hii Gal sample objects showing a signiﬁcant S3+ con-
tribution to the total abundance (ICF > 1.5; 0.18 dex in the derived
sulphur abundance) which are about 28% of the Hii Gal sub-sample,
this contribution is about 45% in average (see lower panel d) of Fig-
ure 14 and is taken into account by the ICF. The highest ICF are
found for objects: J0159+0751, J1205+4551 and J0132+4919, taken
from the sample of compact star-forming galaxies with extremely
high [OIII]/[OII] ﬂux ratios from Izotov et al. (2017) which are
probably strong Ly𝛼 leaking photons and can be considered rather
peculiar.

On the other hand, most of the disc Hii regions (DHR sample),
show ICF close to unity with only 17 objects (7%) of the sub-sample
having ICF > 1.2 and 5 objects (2%) having ICF > 1.5. Therefore,as
stated in Section 3.1 it can be assumed that, in the case of this family
of objects, no ICF corrections are needed.

5.2.2 Total abundances

The distribution of the total abundances of sulphur for the objects
in the two sub-samples is shown in the left panel of Figure 11.

It is evident from the ﬁgure that the S/H distributions in both
samples are rather diﬀerent. The median values of 12+log(S/H) are
6.27 in the case of the Hii galaxies and 6.92 in the case of the disc
Hii regions with 25% of the objects in this sub-sample showing
abundances larger than solar, reaching up to 5 times the solar pho-
tospheric value (12+log(S/H)(cid:12)= 7.12, Asplund et al. 2009). At this
high abundances, the [OIII] 𝜆 4363 Å auroral line is not detected and
hence these objects would had been missing from the metallicity
distribution had oxygen been chosen as abundance tracer. The high-

dance: 12+log(O/H).

median values of about 0.7. This fact justiﬁes the assumption of
T𝑒([SIII]) as the representative electron temperature for the ionised
regions. However, in many cases, and mainly for Hii galaxies, cor-
rections regarding the contribution by S3+ are required.

Most ICF proposed in the literature are based on the ionisation
potential of oxygen ions as compared to those of sulphur with Pe-
imbert & Costero (1969) ﬁrst suggesting the use of the ionic ratio
(𝑂+ + 𝑂++)/𝑂+ as the factor to correct for the lack of observa-
tional data on [SIV] emission lines. Later, Stasińska (1978), based
on photoionisation models, proposed the use of the expression:

(𝑆+ + 𝑆++)/𝐻+ =

(cid:18)

(cid:20)

1 −

to calculate the ICF for sulphur as a function of the O+/O ionic
ratio. Diﬀerent ﬁts to observations by several authors give values
of 𝛼 between 2 and 3 (see, for example, Pérez-Montero et al. 2006;
Dors et al. 2016).

As an alternative to this functional form, in recent works (Fer-
nández et al. 2018), we have proposed the use of the relation be-
tween the ionic ratios of Ar and S in contiguous ionisation stages:

est sulphur abundance is found in region 11 of NGC 5236 (M 83)
(Bresolin et al. 2005). For this object, these authors ﬁnd T𝑒([SIII])=
(4800 ± 200) K, very close to our derived value of (4858 ± 338)
K and agreeing within the errors. Their corresponding value of the
sulphur abundance is 12+log(S/H)= 7.71, also consistent with our
derived value of 7.82 ± 0.08. Therefore, this abundance seems to
be well established.

On the other extreme, the lowest sulphur abundances are found
for objects in the Hii Gal sub-sample, with the lowest values, of about
only 2% of the solar one, found for SBS0035-052E and IZw18. In
these two cases the comparison with the abundances derived by
the authors of the articles of reference is diﬃcult. For IZw18SE
Skillman & Kennicutt (1993), give 12+log(S/H)= 5.55±0.06, that
should be compared to our derived value of 5.70±0.04. However, it
is not clear which electron temperature is used to derive the S++/H+
ionic ratio and no value of T𝑒([SIII]) is given. If T𝑒([OIII]) (17200
K) has been used, this value is higher than the T𝑒([SIII]) derived
here by 2000 K which would then lead to lower values of S++/H+,
and hence lower values of the total S abundance, since this is the
dominant specie and the ICF estimated in the two works diﬀer by
less that 10%. For IZw18NW, the value of 12+log(S/H) given by
Skillman & Kennicutt (1993), and the one derived in the present
work are fully consistent within the errors. This is probably due to
the fact that our value of T𝑒([SIII]) (19400 K) is very close to their
value of T𝑒([OIII]) (19600 K).

The situation is similar for SBS0035-052E. There is a large
diﬀerence between the value of T𝑒([SIII]) given by Izotov et al.
(2009a), 18704 K, and the one obtained here, 13360 K, for knots 1+2
that translates into larger values of the total sulphur abundance in the
latter case by 0.29 dex. Since the oxygen abundance derived by both
Izotov et al. (2009a) and the present work is identical (7.28±0.01),
the diﬀerence in the sulphur abundance implies a diﬀerence in the
S/O abundance of about a factor of 2. On the other hand, as in the
former case, the results obtained for the other region analysed in
this galaxy, knots 4+5, are fully consistent in the two works.

5.2.3 The sulphur over oxygen abundance

Figure 12 shows the relation between the total abundances of oxy-
gen and sulphur which shows a diﬀerent behaviour for the the two
families of objects studied here, the relation being in both cases
almost linear but with diﬀerent slopes which, in principle, argues
against the commonly assumed constancy of the S/O ratio.

In fact, this is more clearly seen in Figure 13 where the S/O
ratio is shown as a function of the S/H abundance (upper panel)
and the O/H abundance (lower panel). There are similarities and
diﬀerences between these two graphs. In the upper panel a tendency
can clearly be seen for Hii galaxies showing an S/O ratio increasing
with increasing sulphur abundance; this tendency is however lost in
the lower panel where the abundance is traced by oxygen. In both
cases, most of the objects show S/O ratios below the solar value
which is indicated by the horizontal line. Izotov et al. (2006) invoke
oxygen depletion onto grains increasing with metallicity to explain a
similar tendency found in Hii galaxies for the Ne/O vs O/H relation.
This might well apply also in our case being more clearly visible
when an undepleted element as sulphur is used as metallicity tracer.
The second tendency, appreciable in both graphs is that ex-
hibited by HII regions. Firstly, they show S/O ratios larger than the
solar value and, secondly they show a tendency for lower S/O ratios
for higher metallicities as traced by both sulphur and oxygen. This
eﬀect has already been noticed by other works (Diaz et al. 1991;
Christensen et al. 1997; Vermeĳ & van der Hulst 2002; Pilyugin

Figure 15. The diﬀerence between O/H abundances derived with the temper-
ature structure assumed in this work, i.e. T𝑒([SIII])=T𝑒([OII])=T𝑒([SII]),

rived from T𝑒([OIII]), plotted against T𝑒([SIII]).

are found for the two studied sub-samples. In Hii galaxies most of
the oxygen is in the form of O++, and a large uncertainty in the
assumed value of T𝑒([OII]) from the choice of diﬀerent photoion-
isation model sequences, as described in Section 3.2, aﬀecting the
derivation of the O+/H+ abundance ratio does not translate into
large uncertainties in the derivation of the total O/H abundance.
However, the opposite can be said about disc Hii regions where
most of the oxygen is in the form of O+, and hence a large uncer-
tainty in the assumed value of T𝑒([OII]) translates into large errors
in the derived total O/H abundance. The formal error attached to
the derivation of T𝑒([OII]) is the propagation of the error in the de-
rived T𝑒([OIII]) value and no uncertainty is attached to the choice
of the photoionisation models involved or the model calibration
obtained. Figure 15 shows the diﬀerence in the O/H abundances
derived with the temperature structure assumed in this work, i.e.
T𝑒([SIII])=T𝑒([OII])=T𝑒([SII]), and the one commonly assumed,
T𝑒([OII])=T𝑒([SII]) with T𝑒([OII]) derived from T𝑒([OIII]) with
the help of Eq. 10, against T𝑒([SIII]). As can be seen in the ﬁgure,
almost no diﬀerence exists for T𝑒([SIII]) (cid:38) 11000 K, but the diﬀer-
ence becomes progressively larger as T𝑒([SIII]) decreases, which
stems from the fact that Eq. 10 overestimates T𝑒([OII]) for low
temperature regions (something recently pointed out also by Yates
et al. (2020)), in fact out of the range of the temperature relation,
which leads to an underestimation of the O+/H+ which is the major
contributor to the O/H abundance. Therefore, the O/H abundances
derived for moderate to high metallicity Hii regions using the stan-
dard method should be taken with caution.

On the other hand, our assumption of T𝑒([SIII]) = T𝑒([OII]) =
T𝑒([SII]) seems to be well justiﬁed in view of recent works that ﬁnd
a tight relation between directly derived T𝑒([SIII]) and T𝑒([NII]),
this latter one characterising the low ionisation zone (Bresolin et al.
2004; Croxall et al. 2015; Berg et al. 2020). Besides, in both Hii
galaxies and disc Hii regions most of the sulphur is in the form of
S++, and the error in the derived total S abundance just depends
on the error in the derivation of T𝑒([SIII]). To this, one should add
the corresponding uncertainty introduced by the estimated ICF for
the approximately 50% of the Hii galaxies for which there is some
contribution by S3+ (light green histogram in lower right panel), at

Figure 14. Distribution of the ionic ratios of oxygen (O+ and O++ (upper

et al. 2006), but its reality is diﬃcult to establish due to the diﬀerent
uncertainties involved, mainly in the derivation of the oxygen abun-
dance and the usually large observational errors present up to now,
but highly reduced in this work. Some of the uncertainties could also
be due to the heterogeneous nature of our general sample, probably
aﬀecting more to the DHR sub-sample comprising HII regions of
diﬀerent sizes and geometries. In order to check our results to a
more homogeneous HII region sub-sample we have collected the
IFU data presented by Yates et al. (2020) in Tables B.1 for selected
HII regions in 12 galaxies from the MANGA survey and B.2 for
their global integrated spectra. They are shown in Figure 13 as blue
diamonds and seem to follow the same trend as our data.

At this point, it is opportune to comment on the uncertainties
involved in both oxygen and sulphur abundance derivations (see
Section 3). Since the observational errors attached to the strong
recombination and collisional line measurements are rather small,
these concern essentially the uncertainties in the derivation of the
electron temperatures involved, which have diﬀerent eﬀects depend-
ing on the ionisation structure of the nebulae. Figure 14 shows the
distribution of the ionic ratios of oxygen (upper panel) and sulphur
(lower panel) one and twice ionised. In the case of oxygen only
the O+ and O++ species are involved, hence mirror distributions

any rate amounting, in average, to less than 30% and included in
the error budget.

If the eﬀect of a decreasing S/O ratio with increasing metallic-
ity in Hii regions is real, as it seems, it is expected to be related to
stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution. Theoretically, sul-
phur is mainly synthesised in hydrostatic and explosive burning of O
and Si, and stars with masses greater than 10 M(cid:12) are the most likely
candidates for its production. The S/O ratio produced is greater for
stars with masses in the range 12-20 M(cid:12); then, in principle, varia-
tions in the IMF for massive stars could produce variations in the
S/O ratio. However, the situation could be more complex if there
were a signiﬁcant contribution from SNIa to the S yield as has lately
been found (see for example Iwamoto et al. 1999). Recent work on
the the chemical composition of evolved stars (upper giant branch)
along the galactic disc (3 to 15 kpc) presenting the trends of ele-
mental abundance ratios, S/O among them, shows very little SNIa
contribution to the sulphur enrichment, contrary to theoretical yield
results, and a decrease of the S/O ratio with increasing metallic-
ity, as shown by our data, is evident although with a smaller slope
Weinberg et al. (2019). Obviously more detailed work is needed,
mostly in the high-metallicity regime, in order to assess the reality
of the trends of S/O with metallicity shown by Hii regions.

5.3 Empirical calibrations

The observation of the nebular sulphur lines provides an excellent
calibrator, S23, for empirical abundance determinations, since they
are easily observable in objects covering a wide range in overall
abundance, the calibration can be done in a purely empirical way
without relying on photoionisation models or extrapolations and
it remains single valued up to metallicities well beyond the solar
abundance.

The calibrations presented in Figure 6 diﬀer only in the ap-
plication of the ICF correction which aﬀects mostly to the regions
showing the highest excitation (lower metallicities). The version
shown in the upper panel can be used with conﬁdence for low exci-
tation Hii regions which constitute the bulk of the giant extragalactic
regions observed over the discs of spirals.

Although the abundance empirical calibrations or strong line
methods assume that ionised regions are essentially characterised
by their chemical composition, the degree of ionisation and the
ionising temperature, as well as the electron density to a lesser
degree, are also involved in the production of the emission line
spectrum. Therefore, a good abundance calibrator should not be
very dependent on these secondary parameters. Actually this is one
of the problems encountered when parameters involving emission
lines of oxygen and nitrogen are used (see, for example McGaugh
1991; Denicoló et al. 2002; Pérez-Montero & Díaz 2005; Yin et al.
2007; Marino et al. 2013).

The dependence of S23 on ionisation parameter and ionisation
temperature can be explored using the [SII]/[SIII] line ratio (Diaz
et al. 1991) and the 𝜂’ one (Vilchez et al. 1988). The upper panel
of Figure 16 shows that there is no apparent correlation between
ionisation parameter and S23, with objects with the lowest metal-
licities (log(S23)< -0.6) showing an almost constant value of the
[SII]/[SIII] ratio and the rest of objects showing a wide range of
values at a given S23. On the other hand, the lower panel of the ﬁg-
ure shows a clear relation between this parameter and 𝜂’ in the sense
that lower metallicity objects, mainly Hii galaxies and Hii regions
in the Magellanic Clouds, show lower values of 𝜂’ (higher ionising
temperatures) than objects with higher metallicities, mainly disc
Hii regions, something already reported by Kehrig et al. (2006) in

Figure 16. Dependence of the S23 from the [SII]/[SIII] excitation ratio,

their study of a small sample of Hii galaxies for a more restricted
parameter range. These relations stem from the fact that a tight cor-
relation exists between 𝜂’ and total sulphur abundance (see Figure
9) while, contrary to what is commonly assumed, no relation seems
to exist between ionisation parameter and metallicity as can be seen
in Figure 17.

To better understand the relation between the S23 parameter
and the functional parameters: S/H, u, and 𝜂’ we have performed
a principal component analysis (PCA). The obtained result clearly
conﬁrms the independence of the ionisation parameter, u, from the
rest of the variables and hence it has been excluded from further
analysis. The relation among the other three parameters involved
explains 76 % of the variance shown by the data set, with very similar
weights by each of them (Fig. 18). This tendency is maintained
in the analysis of the calibration residuals. According to this, we
have made a correction to the derived log(S/H) from the calibration
given by eq. 14 to take into account the correlation of its residuals
with 𝜂’. This correction is a separate term, a function of log(𝜂’),
that should be added to the original calibration and reduces the
typical deviations by 14% for log(S/H) and 10% for log(S23). This
correction is negative for log(𝜂’) > 0.301 and therefore decreases

regions, developing a methodology to derive physical properties and
abundances of ionised regions using mainly spectroscopy in the red-
to-near infrared wavelength range, from 600 to 980 nm. The method
involves the analysis of the emission lines of [SIII] 𝜆 6312 Å, [SII]
𝜆 6717,31 Å and [SIII] 𝜆 9069,9532 Å, analogous to the optical
[OIII] 𝜆 4363 Å, [OII] 𝜆 3227,29 Å and [OIII] 𝜆 4959,5007 Å
lines. This observational set up presents several interesting advan-
tages: the [SIII] 𝜆𝜆 9069,9532 Å are clearly observable over the full
metallicity range and the [SIII]𝜆 6312 Å falls in a spectral region of
high instrumental sensitivity and is weakly aﬀected by underlying
stellar population absorption. These two facts taken together make
it possible to derive the sulphur abundances by direct methods up to
over-solar values. Besides, the region in the ionised nebula where
𝑆2+ originates practically covers both the 𝑂+ and 𝑂2+ ones and
hence the [SIII] electron temperature, T𝑒([SIII]), can be taken as
representative of the whole nebula.

We have compiled a large set of high quality, moderate-to-
high spectral resolution, published data that have been divided in
two sub-samples: Hii regions in spiral and irregular galaxies (DHR
sub-sample) and dwarf galaxies dominated, at present, by a strong
starburst (HiiGal sub-sample). The two sub-samples show overlap-
ping ranges of ionisation parameter, however they diﬀer widely in
the value of the parameter 𝜂’ indicating that objects of sub-sample
HiiGal have hotter ionising stellar populations.

For all the objects, we have derived the abundances of sulphur
by direct methods under the assumption of an ionisation structure
composed of two zones: an intermediate excitation zone where S++
is originated and a low ionisation zone where S+ is formed. For
both sub-samples, S2+ is found to be the dominant ionisation specie,
however, in high ionisation zones, the S3+ contribution cannot be
neglected. We have used an ICF scheme based on the Ar3+/Ar3+
ratio which requires the detection and measurement of the [ArIV]𝜆
4740 Å line, ﬁnding a good correlation between the sulphur ICF
and the parameter 𝜂’, which is a proxy for the ionisation tempera-
ture. We have applied this correlation to estimate the ICF for those
objects without data on the [ArIV] line. Only 28% of the objects
of sub-sample HiiGal show ICF > 1.5 and hence a signiﬁcant S3+
contribution to the total abundance. On the other hand, most of the
objects from sub-sample DHR (disc Hii regions) show ICFs close
to unity and therefore, it is rather safe to assume that, in the case of
this family of objects, no ICF correction needs to be applied.

The S/H abundances distributions in both samples span diﬀer-
ent ranges with median values of 12+log(S/H) of 6.27 in the case of
the HiiGal sub-sample, and 6.92 in the case of the DHR sub-sample
with abundances reaching up to 5 times the solar photospheric value
in the most extreme case. At this high abundances, the [OIII] 𝜆 4363
Å auroral line is not detected and hence these objects would had
been missed from the distribution had oxygen been chosen as abun-
dance tracer. The lowest sulphur abundances are found for objects
in the Hii Gal sub-sample, with the lowest values, of about only
2% of the solar one. A good correlation exists between the sulphur
abundance and 𝜂’ such as low metallicity objects, mostly from the
HiiGal sub-sample, seem to be ionised by stellar clusters of higher
eﬀective temperature (lower 𝜂’ values).

In order to explore the relation between the sulphur and oxygen
abundances, we have derived the latter, also using direct methods,
for the objects of the general sample that have data on the [OIII] 𝜆
4363 Å. Most of the objects from the HiiGal sub-sample show S/O
ratios below the solar value and a trend is found for an increased S/O
ratio with increasing sulphur abundance, that we hypothesise might
be due to a degree of oxygen depletion onto grains increasing with
metallicity. On the other hand, the objects in the DHR sub-sample

6 Summary and conclusions

In this work we have explored the use of sulphur to trace chemical
abundances as deduced from the observation of ionised star-forming

show S/O ratios larger than solar and show a tendency for lower S/O
ratios for higher metallicities as traced by both sulphur and oxygen.
More detailed work is needed, mostly in the high-metallicity regime,
in order to assess the reality of this trend and understand its causes.
Finally, we present a calibration of the S23 parameter with the
S/H abundance both in the form of (S++S++)/H+, i.e. without cor-
recting for the presence of S𝑆3+, and in the form of 12+log(S/H)
where this latter contribution is included through the calculated
ICF. This calibration is an update of those presented (Díaz & Pérez-
Montero 2000) and (Pérez-Montero et al. 2006) and has been pro-
duced using only the highest quality spectroscopic data in order to
reduce the observational errors and study better the systematic ones.
A reexamination of the calibration shows the S23 parameter to be
independent of the ionisation parameter, but weakly correlated with
the 𝜂’ parameter, reﬂecting some dependence of S23 on the temper-
ature of the radiation ﬁeld. An empirical correction is proposed to
account for this eﬀect which applies only to the lowest excitation
objects whose abundances are overestimated by a small amount.
