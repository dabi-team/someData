Abstract 
Measurements  of  the  energy  spectra  of  multiply  charged  positive  and  negative  carbon  ions  ((cid:1829)(cid:3041)±)  recoiling 
from  graphite  surface  under  100  and  150  keV  argon  and  krypton  ion  bombardment  are  presented.  With  the 
energy  spectrometer set at  recoil angle of 79.5°, direct recoil (DR) peaks have been observed with singly as 
well as multiply charged carbon ions (cid:1829)(cid:3041)± , where  n =  1  to 6. These (cid:1829)(cid:3041)± ions have been  observed recoiling 
with the characteristic recoil energy  (cid:1831)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)    =  (cid:1863)(cid:1831)(cid:2868)  (cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1871)(cid:2870) 
(cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019) where (cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)   is the direct recoil  angle,  k = 4m1m2 
/(m 1 + m 2 )2, m1  and  E0  are projectile mass and energy and  m2  is carbon mass. We have observed sharp 
DR  peaks.  A  collimated  projectile  beam  with  divergence  ~ ± 0.2°  is  supplemented  with  a  similar 
collimation before the energy analyzer to reduce the background  of sputtered ions due to scattered   projectiles. 

1. Introduction 

In  our  present  investigations  high  angle  charged  recoils  from  graphite  surface  under  heavy  ion 

bombardments form the basis of Direct Recoil (DR) detection. In these experiments 100 and 150 keV 
Ar+ and Kr+ ions are incident on amorphous graphite. The technique used for charged particle detection 

is Direct Recoil Spectroscopy (DRS) which is the same as Elastic Recoil Detection (ERD) as developed  

by  a  number  of  investigators  [l-4].  In  ERD,  generally  smaller  recoil  angles  ~  20-30°  have  been 

preferred for  the detection of lighter impurities (Z ≤15). At these angles heavy projectiles with 100 s of 

MeV  (i.e.,  with  energy  -  l  MeV  /amu)  result  in  lighter  particles  recoiling  with  at  least  a  few  MeV. 

Whereas, in case of DR studies [5-8,10] keV projectiles are used and recoil angles are generally large 

when scattered projectiles are to be  avoided. 

Regarding  the  charge  state  of  direct  recoils,  ERD  is  insensitive  to  individual  recoil's  charge 

identification since it is mainly a particle detection technique and the detector collects neutral as well as 

charged species. DRS on the other hand, does provide a tool to distinguish between neutral and charged

recoils  and  indicate the  charge  state  as  well  [7,8]. Datz and  Snoek  [9] showed conclusively  that  solid 

surfaces  could  be  used  for  studying  individual  collisions  under  energetic  ionic  bombardment  and  the 

ensuing mechanisms of charge transfer between projectiles and the target atoms. 

Among  the  lighter  targets,  carbon  in  the  form  of  amorphous  graphite  is  a  reasonable  choice  for 

isotropic  materials.  Graphite  has  been  chosen  for  our  present  work  because  of  its  extensive  use  in 

reactors, fission as well as fusion.  

The target atoms recoiling after elastic collisions with projectiles carry with them energies which are 

function of target to projectile mass  ratio (m2/m1),  angle of  recoil (cid:2016)(cid:3045), and the bombarding  energy  (cid:1831)(cid:2868)   

The  probability    of  occur-rence  of  a  recoil  in  a  particular  direction  has  to  be  worked  out  from  the 

calculations and measurements of differential cross sections d u of these events. The cross sections for a 

recoil  to  occur  for  a  particular  combination    of  (m2/m1),  (cid:2016)(cid:3045),  and  the  bombarding    energy    (cid:1831)(cid:2868)  can  be 

worked out from   the LSS [11,12] theory. However, the probability  of a specific charge state of a recoil 

depends on factors like the  type of chemical bonding of targets, formation of molecular  orbitals during 

collisions [13,14] and the state  of  sputtering surface e.g., adsorption, ion induced roughing,  etc.  There 

have been attempts to provide explanations on the  basis of models of Hagstrum [15] and Van der Weg 

and Pol [16].  

Our  choice  of  carbon  as  target  and  Ar+  and  Kr+  as  bombarding  ions  has  been  prompted  by  the 

requirements of moderate recoil  energies in the range  0  < Er < 5  keV for  an effective utilization of a 

compact  90°  electrostatic  energy  analyzer  (EEA)  and  secondly,  the  requirement  to  keep  the  data 

acquisition time per run ~ 20-30 min  with  a few µA beam. These conditions require  that c oll i si on 

cross sections be  such that recoil  emissions  at  (cid:2016)(cid:3045)=  79.5° be significant and measurable. 

The (cid:1831)(cid:3005)(cid:3019) measurements are performed at a fixed recoil angle (cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019) = 79.5°. The energy of graphite 

atoms/clusters of  mass m2  recoiling at angle  (cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)   is given by 

(cid:1831)(cid:3005)(cid:3019) = 4(cid:4668)((cid:1865)(cid:2869)(cid:1865)(cid:2870))/((cid:1865)(cid:2869) + (cid:1865)(cid:2870))(cid:2870)(cid:4669)(cid:1831)(cid:2868)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1871)(cid:2870)(cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)

according  to  Sigmund  [12] utilizing  the  LSS  theory as

compared  with  that for 60°. This ratio is further enhanced  when  we  go  from  Ar+  to Kr+.  In our 

setup due to  high  recoil angle  (cid:2016)(cid:3045)  ,    the    scattered    projectiles    are    avoided  and  the  characteristic  DR

this  initial  cleaning   process,  secondary ions emitted  are continually  monitored and  a systematic  

evaluation  of  adsorbed    gases'  contribution    is  done.  A  state  of  dynamic  cleaning  is  achieved 

when  (cid:1829)(cid:3041)± peaks dominate over those due to N ±, 0 ±  etc. For example, the dynamically clean 
surface  at 100 keV  Kr+-C  the ratio C+/N+ ~ 4 when counts per unit interval of recoil energy 
(counts/(cid:2012)E) are compared. The measured ratio of total counts C+/N+ ~ 8 and similarly for 
C-/N-~10.  Al-though  the  spectrum  has  large  number  of  peaks  but  the  cumulative  (cid:1829)(cid:3041)±  counts 

predominate  over  all  other  species.  These  numbers  also  indicate  that  less  than  a  monolayer  is 

expected to be on the surface during the   experiments. 

There is a peculiar advantage of having the adsorbed species present  in  the recoil  spectra as we  
can      calibrate  the      (cid:1831)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)      pointers    for    N±,  O±,    etc.,    which    help    us        to  clearly    distinguish  
various   peaks   due  to  (cid:1829)(cid:3041)±.   N±   peaks are  generally  very  sharp  and  help to  establish  positions  of

at  50, 75 and 100 keV, respectively. For all of the three bombarding energies, arrows point to the 

positions  of  expected  DR  peaks  for  singly  charged  recoils.  The  spread  around  the  main  peaks    is 

noticeable.  Also identifiable are the higher charge states at (cid:1831)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)/n, where n ≥ 2. It may  be  pointed  

out that the maximum recoil energy delivered to any mass  in  a  binary  collision  at  (cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019) = 79.5°  

is  3.32  keV  i.e., for (m2/m1) = 1  and  E0 = 100 keV. Since we can see recoils up to S keV even 

in  SO  keV  spectrum,  which  indicates    a  large  contribution  by  the  scattered  projectiles.  This 

contribution  is seen on the higher  side of  the  DR  peaks  with  Er > EDR  which  implies  (cid:2016)(cid:3045) < (cid:2016)(cid:3005)(cid:3019)· 

This particular  set  of  data  (Fig.  2)  was taken  with a single aperture of 0.8 mm diameter in front 

of  the  EEA.  Although  this  subtended  a  small  solid  angle  of  8.7 x  10-6  st.  rad.  but  did  allow 

(cid:2012)(cid:2016)(cid:3045)~ ± 0.6° which can introduce large errors in (cid:2016)DR and EDR measurements. This spread in recoil 

angle  is  due  to  the  beam  spread  at  large  (cid:2009)  angle.  Rest of the data presented  in Figs. 3-6 has been 

taken  with  a  collimator  placed  in  front  of  the  EEA  which  limits  the  spread  in  (cid:2012)(cid:2016)(cid:3045)~ ± 0.1°.  The 

most  important  effect  of  the  collimator  in  front  of  EEA  is  the  reduction  of  scattered  projectiles'   

contribution  in  the  energy  spectra  which  in  turn  reduces  the  background  and  enhances  direct  recoil 

peaks.
