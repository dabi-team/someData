ABSTRACT
We examine limits to the energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated by relativistic
shocks, showing that acceleration of light ions as high as 100 EeV is unlikely. The
implication of our estimates is that if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are accelerated by
shocks, then those shocks are probably not relativistic.

INTRODUCTION

The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is still
a mystery. A number of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration pro-
cesses have been proposed. Here we concentrate on diﬀusive
shock acceleration (Axford, Leer & Skadron 1977, Krimskii
1977, Bell 1978, Blandford & Ostriker 1978). General ar-
guments (Hillas 1984; Blandford 2000) indicate that accel-
eration to ∼ 100 EeV is favoured by high shock velocities,
large magnetic ﬁelds, large spatial scales and shocks with a
high power throughput as may occur in outﬂows from ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGN) and gamma-ray bursts (GRB).
These factors point towards relativistic shocks as likely ac-
celerators of UHECR, but here we give reasons why this is
not the case. In this paper we show that, if UHECR are
accelerated by shocks, then those shocks are probably not
relativistic.

We discuss three eﬀects that limit the maximum energy

to which CR can be accelerated by relativistic shocks:
(i) Steep CR spectrum. Relativistic shocks generate CR en-
ergy spectra that are steeper than those generated by non-
relativistic shocks. Consequently, there is less energy in the
high energy CR component to drive the turbulence and am-
plify the magnetic ﬁeld that scatters the high energy CR
and determines the rate at which CR are accelerated (Sec-
tion 3).
(ii) Small-scale turbulence. Because CR do not penetrate far
upstream of relativistic shocks and because anisotropy in the
CR momentum distribution decays rapidly downstream of
the shock, the jCR × B force (where jCR is the CR electric
current and B is the magnetic ﬁeld) has time to drive tur-
bulence only on scales much smaller than a UHECR Larmor
radius and consequently does not eﬀectively scatter UHECR

(Section 4).
(iii)Quasi-perpendicular shocks. Because relativistic shocks
are characteristically quasi-perpendicular, the scattering
magnetic ﬁeld has to be ampliﬁed within one UHECR
Larmor radius of the shock for eﬀective scattering before
UHECR are advected downstream away from the shock
(Section 5).

The structure of the paper is that, after two introduc-
tory sections, we progressively add in each of these three
eﬀects and show how each successively reduces the maxi-
mum possible CR energy. The results are presented in Table
1 and Figure 1, to which we will refer during the course
of the paper. In Section 6 we compare relativistic and non-
relativistic shocks. In Section 7 we discuss the acceleration
of heavier nuclei, but in all earlier parts of the paper we
consider only protons. In section 8 we present our conclu-
sions. Throughout this paper we use SI units except where
explicitly stated.

2 UPPER LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM CR

ENERGY

As discussed by Hillas (1984) an upper limit to the maxi-
mum energy to which a CR particle can be accelerated by a
shock is TH = uBR where R is the size of the accelerating
region, u is the characteristic velocity of the bulk thermal
plasma, and TH is the particle kinetic energy in eV. The
Larmor radius of an UHECR is orders of magnitude larger
than that of thermal particles, so the bulk thermal plasma
behaves magnetohydrodynamically (MHD) with a local elec-
tric ﬁeld E = −u × B. Consequently uB is the maximum
electric ﬁeld available and uBR corresponds to moving the
particle a distance R through an electric ﬁeld uB. The Hillas

1.1 (T /EeV) (B/µG)−1 kpc. CR reaching the Hillas limit at
a relativistic shock have a Larmor radius comparable with

The magnitude of B is crucial. At non-relativistic
shocks in supernova remnants (SNR), CR drive an insta-
bility that ampliﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld (typically to 100s
of µG) far beyond that in the ambient medium (Bell 2004).
There are other means by which the magnetic ﬁeld might be
ampliﬁed (Giacalone & Jokipii 2007) but these amplify the
ﬁeld over a large distance downstream of the shock and we
do not consider them here since ﬁeld ampliﬁcation needs to
take place close to a relativistic shock. Similar, presumably
CR-driven, magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation appears to happen
at the termination shocks of the jets of radio galaxies where
the hot-spot ﬁeld is again typically 100s µG (eg Araudo et
al 2016). Magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation is a general feature of
optimal CR acceleration to high energy since the magnetic
energy density upstream of the shock can be expected to be
much smaller than the kinetic energy density (Γsh − 1)ρc2
produced by any event releasing suﬃcient energy to be ca-
pable of particle acceleration to high energy (where ρ is the
density and Γsh the Lorentz factor of the bulk ﬂow).

The magnetic ﬁeld B in the expression for TH is there-
fore generally a turbulent magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁed by the
CR. This has two consequences. First, the magnetic energy
density cannot be larger than the energy density of the CR
amplifying the ﬁeld. Second, the scale-size s of the turbu-
lent magnetic ﬁeld cannot exceed the Larmor radius of the
CR driving the turbulence as discussed in Section 4. Mag-
netic ﬁeld structured on a scale much smaller than the CR
Larmor radius is ineﬀective in scattering the CR. Hence,
low energy CR with a small Larmor radius contribute little
to the scattering of high energy CR. The scattering of CR
with a given energy is dominated by turbulent magnetic ﬁeld
generated by CR with that same energy. And consequently,
as discussed below, the energy density of the magnetic ﬁeld
scattering CR with a given energy cannot greatly exceed the
energy density of CR with that energy. A further apparent
consequence of strong turbulent magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation

c(cid:13) 2014 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

3

is that any uniform ﬁeld existing upstream of the shock, be-
ing comparatively small, has little eﬀect on CR transport.
Shocks can then be treated as unmagnetized in the sense
that magnetic ﬁeld ordered on a large supra-Larmor spatial
scale is negligible. We will show in Section 5 that this last
statement, while being true for CR at most energies, needs
severe qualiﬁcation. In the case of perpendicular relativistic
shocks, the uniform magnetic ﬁeld turns out to be impor-
tant in determining the maximum CR energy. However, for
the moment we will assume that CR transport is dominated
by the turbulent disordered magnetic ﬁeld and treat shocks
as unmagnetised on the large scale. Equivalently, this is the
same as treating shocks as parallel rather than perpendic-
ular since a large scale magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the shock
normal has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on CR transport.

The importance of the scale-size s is seen in Lagage
& Cesarsky (1983a,b) and Drury (1983) who estimated a
characteristic time for CR acceleration:

taccel =

3
u2
sh

(cid:18) rDu + r2Dd
r − 1

(cid:19)

(2)

where Du and Dd are the CR spatial diﬀusion coeﬃcients
upstream and downstream of the shock respectively, ush is
the shock velocity, and r is the compression at the shock
(that is, ush/r is the downstream ﬂow velocity relative
to the shock). The maximum acceleration rate occurs if
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is of the order of Bohm diﬀusion,
DBohm = crg/3 = T /3B, since the CR scattering mean free
path λ cannot be smaller than the Larmor radius rg. Ac-
celeration must take place in time R/ush, so the maximum
CR energy is deﬁned by taccel = R/ush. Assuming a ﬁxed
ratio for λ/rg, and estimating that the magnetic ﬁeld is com-
pressed and increased by a factor rB at the shock, the max-
imum CR energy is [rB/r][(r − 1)/(rB + 1)](rg/λ)ushBR ,
where 1 (cid:54) rB (cid:54) r depending on the angle between the mag-
netic ﬁeld and the shock normal. For strong ultra-relativistic
and non-relativistic shocks r takes the values 3 (Kirk &
Duﬀy 1999) and 4 repectively. For simplicity we make the
approximation that ush = c, rB = r = 3, and so deﬁne a
‘Lagage & Cesarsky’ (LC) limit as

TLC =

(cid:16) rg
λ

(cid:17) cBR

.

(3)

Observational evidence (Stage et al 2006, Uchiyama et
al 2007) indicates that Bohm diﬀusion applies at non-
relativistic shocks. Furthermore, the diﬀusion has to be ap-
proximately Bohm for SNR to accelerate Galactic CR to the
knee in the spectrum observed at a few PeV.

In later sections we will see that the maximum CR en-
ergy is low at relativistic shocks because the CR mean free
path is often much larger than the Larmor radius since the
spatial scale-size of the magnetic ﬁeld is much smaller than
rg. If the magnetic ﬁeld is randomly orientated on a scale-
size s, each cell scatters the CR through a small angle s/rg,
and the mean free path is

λ ≈

(see for example, Ostrowski & Bednarz (2002), Kirk & Re-
ville (2010), Lemoine & Pelletier (2010), Sironi, Spitkovsky
& Arons (2013) and Reville & Bell (2014)). rg = TLC/cB,

so

.

(5)

The energy TLC is smaller than the Hillas energy TH by a
factor (cid:112)s/2R. This means that if CR are to be accelerated
to energies approaching the Hillas limit, as seems necessary
to reach ∼ 100 EeV, then the magnetic ﬁeld responsible for
scattering them in the shock environment must be generated
by the high energy CR themselves. If turbulence is driven by
the non-resonant hybrid (NRH) instability (Bell 2004) or the
resonant instability (Lerche 1967, Kulsrud & Pearce 1969)
the scale-size s is equal to the CR Larmor radius or smaller.
If the turbulence is driven by CR protons with 1 GeV energy
in a magnetic ﬁeld of 1 µG at a shock with R = 1 kpc, then
s ∼ rg ∼ 3 × 1010m and
sR = 3 × 10−5R. Other longer
wavelength instabilities (eg Drury & Falle 1986, Bykov et
al 2011) may play a role in scattering CR, but they are
unlikely to close the large gap between the values of s and
R. Hence we assume that we need only consider magnetic
ﬁeld ampliﬁcation driven by the highest energy CR because
magnetic ﬁeld on smaller scales is unable to accelerate CR to
high energy. More will be said about this assumption below.

√

3 THE MAGNITUDE OF THE MAGNETIC

FIELD

In later sections we consider the eﬀect of non-Bohm diﬀusion
(λ (cid:29) rg), but ﬁrst we consider the limit on the maximum
CR energy arising from the condition that the energy density
of the magnetic ﬁeld responsible for scattering CR is limited
to the energy density of the CR at the same energy. In this
section we assume that λ = rg.

The standard CR energy spectrum generated by strong
non-relativistic shocks is proportional to T −2. This spreads
the CR energy density uniformly in log(T ) with the con-
sequence that a signiﬁcant fraction of the available shock
energy is given to the highest energy particles. In contrast,
relativistic shocks produce steeper CR spectra ∝ T −β where
β is larger than 2. Kirk et al (2000) (see also Achterberg
et al (2001)) derive β = 2.23, and simulations by Sironi
et al (2013) produce a spectrum steeper than this. A com-
monly observed synchrotron spectral index for radio galaxies
is α ∼ 0.75, corresponding to β ∼ 2.5, and powerful radio
galaxies tend to have even steeper spectra (Blundell, Rawl-
ings & Willott (1999), Miley & De Breuck (2001)). If CR
are injected into the acceleration process at low suprather-
mal (GeV) energies, even a small steepening of the spectrum
substantially reduces the CR energy density at EeV energies.
This is important because EeV CR are most strongly scat-
tered by turbulence generated by the EeV CR themselves,
and the scattering magnetic energy density is correspond-
ingly small. CR at GeV energies have a large energy density
and generate a large magnetic ﬁeld, but its maximum scale
is that of the Larmor radius of GeV CR, which is too small
to scatter EeV CR eﬀectively.

If Γsh is the Lorentz factor of the shock, the energy
density available for CR acceleration is (Γsh − 1)ρc2. We
deﬁne the fraction of this energy given to CR with energy
T in a logarithmic energy range (∆T = T ) to be

η(T ) = η0(T /Tinj)−(β−2)

(6)

4

where Tinj is the injection energy. Estimates of CR accel-
eration eﬃciency in the Galaxy are varied (eg Drury 1983,
Blandford & Eichler 1987) but the eﬃciency must be high
to provide the measured Galactic CR density, and obser-
vations of supernova remnants indicate that the CR pres-
sure is dynamically signiﬁcant (Helder et al 2012). We take
η0 = 0.1, equivalent to ∼ 30% of the available energy going
to CR, and ignore the dependence of the CR energy den-
sity on β for a given η0. In a similar vein of approximation
we assume that the injection energy is relativistic and that
Tinj ∼ ΓshGeV. Given the approximate nature of our calcu-
lation we simplify our notation by treating shocks as rela-
tivistic and ignoring the diﬀerence between Γsh − 1 and Γsh.
In the generous assumption of energy equipartition between
CR at energy T and the magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁed by CR at
energy T , the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀective in scattering CR with
energy T is BT ∼ (µ0η(T )Γshρc2)1/2, which is equivalent to
BT ∼ 500Γ1/2

tal magnetic ﬁeld, but only the component responsible for
scattering CR with energy T . The total magnetic ﬁeld is
larger and is dominated by the ﬁeld ampliﬁed by low energy
suprathermal CR. The corresponding LC limit with Bohm
diﬀusion cBTR/2 (λ ≈ rg in equation 3) is

and ξ(2.5) = 1.2 × 1018 (see Fig 1 and Table 1). We have
labeled this energy TBohm because of the assumption that
λ = rg. TBohm is much less than the CR energy achievable
in the total magnetic ﬁeld, for example cBR/2 = 230 EeV if
R = 1 kpc and B = 500 µG, but TBohm still exceeds 1 EeV.
The choice of 10−4cm−3 as the characteristic density
may appear to be unnecessarily low, but a higher density
would imply an uncomfortably large energy ﬂux through the
shock unless a smaller characteristic scale-size R were cho-
sen. The characteristic parameters adopted in equation (8)
are appropriate for jet termination shocks of radio galaxies.
Alternatively a larger density and smaller scale-size might
be chosen. However, as shown by Waxman (1995, 2001) and
Blandford (2000), the choice of realistic parameters is lim-
ited by the energy ﬂux through the shock. Equation (8) can
be recast in terms of the shock power, Ps = πR2Γshρc3, or
equivalently

Ps = 1.5Γsh

Even with the generous assumption of Bohm diﬀusion and
equipartition magnetic ﬁelds, protons can be accelerated to
a few EeV only if energy is fed through the shock at a power
exceeding 1040W, independent of the density and scale-size.
The power would need to be higher (Ps ∝ T β
Bohm) for proton
acceleration to 100 EeV.

4 THE SCALE-SIZE OF THE MAGNETIC

FIELD

We have argued above that the turbulent magnetic ﬁeld
must dominate any ambient ordered magnetic ﬁeld. The
maximum acceleration rate at shocks occurs if the CR diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient is of the order of Bohm diﬀusion coeﬃcient,
DBohm = crg/3 = T /3B, for which the CR scattering mean
free path λ is approximately equal to the Larmor radius rg.
We now show that the scattering mean free path λ is in fact
much larger than the CR Larmor radius rg as deduced from
observations of termination shocks in radio galaxies (Araudo
et al 2015, 2016). This limits further the energy to which CR
can be accelerated by relativistic shocks. The magnetic ﬁeld
is frozen-in to the thermal plasma which behaves magne-
tohydrodynamically. Magnetic ﬁeld can only be generated
on a scale s if the plasma into which it is frozen is moved
a distance s by the jCR × B force through which the CR
with current density jCR acts on the background thermal
plasma. An upper limit on the distance moved is therefore
s ∼ jCRBt2/Γshρ where t is the time during which the force
acts.

If the CR proton current jCR exists in a layer of thick-
ness L about the shock, then t ∼ L/c. The energy ﬂux of
CR with energy T is ∼ η(T )Γshρc3, so jCR ≈ η(T )Γshρc3/T
(Bell 2004) giving

s ∼ η(T )rg

(cid:19)2

(cid:18) L
rg

(11)

where rg = T /cB. The ratio L/rg is expected to either re-
main constant or increase (become less Bohm-like) with in-
creasing CR energy, but not decrease (become more Bohm-
like). Unless the CR spectral index is very steep (β > 3),
η(T )rg (∝ T −(β−3)) increases with energy. Consequently s
increases with CR energy and, as discussed above, the scat-
tering of CR at a particular energy is dominated by the
turbulent magnetic ﬁeld generated by CR with that energy.
The scale-size of magnetic ﬁeld generated by lower energy
CR is too small to eﬀectively scatter CR.

When considering the scattering of CR with the high-
est energy (Tmax) we need only take account of the mag-
netic ﬁeld generated by these CR through their current
density jCR ≈ η(Tmax)Γshρc3/Tmax. The maximum char-
acteristic time during which the jCR × B force acts is R/c,
so the maximum displacement of the background plasma is
jCRBR2/c2Γshρ, giving

smax ∼

η(Tmax)R2
rg(Tmax)

(12)

where rg(Tmax) = Tmax/cB. We assume that the magnetic
ﬁeld is randomly orientated in cells of size smax. Equation
(4) for the mean free path λ gives rg/λ ∼ ηR2/r2
g. In combi-
nation with equation (3), the maximum CR energy is then

where Bs = [µ0η(Ts)Γshρc2]1/2, and we have labeled this
energy Ts since it is derived by determining the displacement
s of the bulk ﬂuid by the jCR × B force. As in Section 3, the
magnetic ﬁeld Bs is assumed to be in energy equipartition
with CR with energy ∼ Ts. From equation (6) for η(T ),

where ξs(β) = 10(9β+6.24)/(β−0.8). giving ξs(2.5) = 8 × 1016
and ξs(2.23) = 3 × 1018 (see Fig 1 and Table 1).

These equations show the combined eﬀect of the rela-
tivistic steepening of the power law (β > 2) both for re-
ducing the equipartition magnetic ﬁeld, as in the previous
section, and also for reducing the jCR × B force, reduc-
ing the distance by which the plasma can be moved, and
thereby resulting in a diﬀusion coeﬃcient larger than Bohm
(λ > rg). For this reason, the energy Ts derived in this sec-
tion is smaller than the energy TBohm given by equation (8).
The diﬀerence between Ts and TBohm is greater when the
CR energy spectrum is steeper.

The estimate Ts derived in this section for the maximum
CR energy is based on the maximum turbulence scale-size
that can be generated by the jCR × B force operating in the
equipartition magnetic ﬁeld (equation (7)). The magnetic
ﬁeld only reaches equipartition if the instability responsible
for magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation has suﬃcient time to grow.

5 MAGNETIC FIELD AMPLIFICATION AT

RELATIVISTIC SHOCKS

As noted above, shocks only accelerate CR to high energy if
the magnetic ﬁeld is ampliﬁed beyond its ambient value, in
which case CR transport is dominated by small angle scat-
tering and isotropic diﬀusion. Acceleration to high energy is
only possible if the CR currents are suﬃcient to drive the
turbulence and generate the ampliﬁed magnetic ﬁeld in the
time available. This imposes an additional limitation on CR
acceleration: that the linear growth time of the plasma in-
stability responsible for amplifying the magnetic ﬁeld must
be smaller than the time t during which CR drive the insta-
bility.

If the shock is parallel or unmagnetised and CR are free
to propagate large distances away from the shock then t ∼
R/c. If the CR are scattered such that the mean free path λ
is smaller than R, then (equation (4)) t ∼ λ/c ∼ r2
g/sc since
λ is the maximum spatial scale of the upstream CR precur-
sor and also the distance over which momentum anisotropy
decays downstream. However, as discussed below in Section
5.1, if the shock is perpendicular then CR currents exist only
within a Larmor radius of the shock (Milosavljevic & Nakar
2006) and the relevant time is t ∼ rg0/c where rg0 = T /cB0⊥
is the CR Larmor radius in the uniform perpendicular mag-
netic ﬁeld B0⊥. If λ < rg0 then t ∼ λ/c as with parallel
shocks. Overall, the time during which currents of CR with
energy T drive turbulence is

determining the characteristic times in the brackets are R,
rg0 & λ (= r2
g/s) respectively. The time available for mag-
netic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation varies according to whether the
shock is parallel or perpendicular, and whether or not the
CR are strongly scattered.

It is well known (eg Kirk & Duﬀy 1999) that ultra-
relativistic shocks are much more likely to be quasi-
perpendicular than quasi-parallel with respect to the up-
stream ambient magnetic ﬁeld. CR moving along a ﬁeld
line (zero pitch angle) can only escape ahead of an oblique
shock if the direction of the ﬁeld line lies within an angle
θ = sin−1(1/Γsh) of the shock normal. Upstream escape is
further restricted if the CR pitch angle is non-zero and the
CR spirals along the magnetic ﬁeld. Another reason why
relativistic shocks behave quasi-perpendicularly is that the
perpendicular component, unlike the parallel component, is
increased by a factor Γsh when transforming from the up-
stream rest frame to the rest frame of the shock. Addition-
ally, compression of the perpendicular component as it tra-
verses the shock further increases the perpendicularity of
the magnetic ﬁeld downstream of the shock. Since relativis-
tic shocks are characteristically perpendicular rather than
parallel, we treat the perpendicular case ﬁrst before return-
ing to the case of parallel shocks.

The CR current around non-relativistic shocks is pre-
dominantly upstream of the shock as the CR diﬀuse ahead
of the shock in a stationary precursor. In contrast, the CR
currents occur both upstream and downstream of relativis-
tic shocks since strong anisotropies at the shock take a
while to decay as the CR are advected away downstream
of the shock. Figures 2 and 3 of Bell et al (2011) show that
there can be strong downstream currents at perpendicular
shocks even at shock velocities as low as c/10. CR currents
at high velocity perpendicular shocks are primarily diamag-
netic anisotropies due to a deﬁciency of CR with gyrocentres
upstream of the spatial point in question. Downstream cur-
rents are also strong at fully relativistic parallel shocks in
the downstream plasma frame since CR have to drift at a
velocity greater than c/3 to re-enter the upstream plasma
from downstream. The NRH instability is excited by CR
currents both upstream and downstream of the shock. For
simplicity, and in keeping with our level of approximation,
we treat magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation as though it occurs
entirely downstream of the shock. Note from Section 5.1.1
below, that the maximum CR energy depends on the uni-
form magnetic ﬁeld B0 at perpendicular shocks where the
CR current is strong downstream of the shock. The appro-
priate magnitude of B0 in the calculation is its compressed
downstream value.

5.1 Strong magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation at

perpendicular shocks

Here we demonstrate that the plasma instability generating
the turbulent magnetic ﬁeld must be able to amplify the
magnetic ﬁeld by a large factor in the time rg0/c during
which the plasma advects one Larmor radius downstream
from the shock.

Our model is as follows. A uniform perpendicular mag-
netic ﬁeld exists upstream of the shock. The uniform ﬁeld
is compressed to a downstream magnitude B0 as it passes
through the shock. Because the magnetic ﬁeld increases at

6

the shock, the CR drift along the shock front with a current
density jCR ∼ ηΓshρc3/T distributed over a layer of thick-
ness rg0 = T /cB0 around the shock in the absence of scatter-
ing. jCR is directed along the shock surface and perpendicu-
lar to B0. The jCR × B0 acts along the shock normal to slow
down the background plasma ﬂowing through the shock, but
it also excites the NRH instability (Bell 2004) with k vector
aligned parallel to B0 as derived by Bell (2005). Riquelme &
Spitkovsky (2010) have investigated in depth the instability
in this perpendicular geometry (jCR perpendicular to B0),
referring to it as the perpendicular current-driven instabil-
ity (PCDI), using a 2D PIC code. Using a 3D MHD code
with an imposed uniform CR current, Matthews et al (2017)
compare the perpendicular geometry with the parallel ge-
ometry (jCR parallel to B0 as in Bell (2004)). Riquelme &
Spitkovsky and Matthews et al show that the two geometries
have closely similar linear growth rates (consistent with the
dispersion relation derived as equation (4) of Bell (2005)).
Matthews et al ﬁnd closely similar parallel and perpendic-
ular non-linear growth rates (consistent with simulations of
the parallel geometry by Beresnyak & Li (2014)). More-
over, the instability converges to a similar non-linear spatial
structure in both geometries. In its 3D non-linear turbulent
phase, when the magnetic ﬁeld has been signiﬁcantly ampli-
ﬁed, the instability loses sense of the initial direction of B0
relative to jCR. In both geometries the instability converges
to a cavity/wall/loop structure qualitatively similar to the
expanding loop version of the instability analysed in section
2.2 of Bell (2005). Given the insensitivity to the orientation
of jCR relative to B0 and the approximate nature of our cal-
culations, we apply a common analysis to instability growth
without distinguishing between parallel and perpendicular
geometries of the NRH instability. We consider the mag-
netic ﬁeld to be the sum of the large-scale uniform ﬁeld of
magnitude B0 and a turbulent ﬁeld of magnitude B1 gener-
ated by the NRH instability and growing to be much larger
than B0.

As in Section 4, we estimate the maximum distance
s that the jCR × B1 force can displace the plasma in the
available time, which we take to be ∼ rg0/c in this sec-
tion, and thereby estimate the scale-size of the turbulently
generated magnetic ﬁeld: s ∼ jCRB1(rg0/c)2/Γshρ where
jCR ∼ η(T )Γshρc3/T and rg0 = T /cB0, giving

s ∼ η(T )rg0

Since η (cid:28) 1 for high energy CR, s (cid:28) rg0 unless the ampliﬁed
magnetic ﬁeld is much larger than the uniform ﬁeld.

CR are accelerated at a relativistic quasi-perpendicular
shock only if CR are strongly scattered within a distance of
one Larmor radius downstream of the shock. That is, the
scattering mean free path immediately downstream of the
shock must be less than a Larmor radius, λ < rg0 (Lemoine
& Pelletier 2010, Reville & Bell 2014). Since λ ∼ r2
g/s (equa-
tion (6)) where rg is the CR Larmor radius in the ampliﬁed
ﬁeld, the condition that λ < rg0 imposes a requirement of
strong magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, B1 (cid:29) B0:

which shows that the scale-size s of the turbulence can be

The exponent (β − 2)/3 is small for our representative val-
ues of β (2.23 and 2.5), but for acceleration to high en-
ergy, T /Tinj (cid:29) 1, signiﬁcant magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation is
needed during the time t ∼ rg0/c in which the plasma ad-
vects a distance of one Larmor radius rg0 = T /cB0 in the
uniform ﬁeld B0. The CR current needs to be able to drive
the ampliﬁcation process for many instability growth times.

5.1.1 Magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation and the maximum CR

energy at relativistic perpendicular shocks

Since the scale-size s is much larger than the thermal Lar-
mor radius, the ﬁeld must be ampliﬁed by a MHD instability,
most probably the NRH instability as discussed in the previ-
ous section. For any other MHD process to drive non-linear
turbulence more eﬀectively and to enable CR acceleration
to higher energy, it would have to make better use of the
jCR × B force, which appears unlikely from the simple dy-
namical argument in section 4. Kinetic instabilities such as
the Weibel instability operate on a scale which is too small
to scatter UHECR.

The NRH instability has a maximum growth rate
(cid:112)µ0/Γshρ (Bell 2004) where jCR ∼
γmax = 0.5jCR
ηΓshρc3/T as above. The NRH instability has the advantage
that it can amplify the magnetic ﬁeld by orders of magni-
tude since it continues to grow rapidly in its non-linear phase
(δB/B (cid:29) 1). As discussed by Bell et al (2013), an approx-
imate condition for the time t taken for ampliﬁcation by a
factor 10-100 in parallel geometry is given by γmaxt ∼ 5−10.
As noted above, growth is very similar in parallel and per-
pendicular geometry. Matthews et al (2017) show that the
main diﬀerence is that in the perpendicular geometry the
transition from linear growth to the slower non-linear growth
occurs at a smaller amplitude, thereby marginally increasing
the time needed to reach a given non-linear amplitude.

CR acceleration is only possible if the scattering mean
free path λ is smaller than the CR Larmor radius rg0, and
we have argued in previous sections that scattering of CR
with energy T is dominated by turbulent magnetic ﬁeld
generated by CR with the same energy T . If the mag-
netic ﬁeld is ampliﬁed by the NRH instability, then the
maximum CR energy TNRH,⊥ for acceleration at a perpen-
dicular shock in magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁed by the NRH in-
stability is determined by the condition γmaxt ∼ 5 − 10
(cid:112)µ0/Γshρ where
for t = TNRH,⊥/cB0 and γmax = 0.5jCR
jCR ∼ η(TNRH,⊥)Γshρc3/Tmax . Hence TNRH,⊥ is determined
by the equation

and ξ⊥(2.23) = 1.6 × 1014 (see Fig 1 and Table 1). This en-
ergy is labelled TNRH,⊥ because it is limited by the growth
of the NRH instability at a perpendicular shock. CR beyond
this energy are unable to generate turbulence before passing
a Larmor radius rg0 downstream of the shock. Their scatter-
ing length λ in given turbulence increases strongly in propor-
tion to T 2, whereas their Larmor radius rg0 increases only
in proportion to T , so they are carried away downstream
without returning to the shock for further acceleration.

5.2 Perpendicular shocks with low magnetization

This estimate (equation (21)) of the maximum CR energy
falls far short of 100 EeV needed to explain the acceleration
of UHECR. Equation (21) might be interpreted as an indica-
tion that large CR energies might be reached if the upstream
magnetic ﬁeld is very small. However, the above analysis as-
sumes that the CR Larmor radius in the shock-compressed
upstream magnetic ﬁeld is smaller than the shock radius
R. This condition only holds if B0 exceeds a critical value
Bcrit = (TNRH,⊥/EeV)(R/kpc)−1µG. If B0 < Bcrit, the Lar-
mor radius is greater than the shock radius and the time
available for magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation is t ∼ R/c which is
smaller than the value rg0/c assumed here. At the limits of
the perpendicular shock analysis, B0 = Bcrit, in which case

If B0 (cid:54) Bcrit, the appropriate analysis is that of a parallel or

Hence in the case that B0 is very small and the shock is

limit on the energy to which CR can be accelerated (see

shocks

CR acceleration by relativistic shocks is hampered by a
number of factors:
(i) The CR energy spectrum is steeper than T −2, so a
smaller fraction of the shock energy is given to the highest
energy CR that drive the large-scale turbulence required to
scatter the highest energy CR.

so CR have to be strongly scattered
within one Larmor radius if they are to return to the shock
from downstream.
(iii) Because of (ii), the jCR × B force has insuﬃcient time
to move the bulk thermal plasma through one CR Larmor
radius, so the scale-size s of the ampliﬁed magnetic ﬁeld is
small; it can only scatter the CR eﬀectively if it is ampliﬁed
to a magnitude much larger than that of the uniform ﬁeld
B0. There is little time for CR-driven plasma instabilities
to amplify the magnetic ﬁeld.

predominantly

In contrast, in the case of non-relativistic shocks:
(i) The standard CR energy spectrum, T −2 places equal en-
ergy densities in each logarithmic range of energy.
(ii) Non-relativistic shocks are predominantly quasi-parallel
rather than perpendicular; CR are able to diﬀuse far up-
stream, amplify the magnetic ﬁeld before it is overtaken by
the shock, and produce strong CR scattering both upstream
and downstream of the shock.
(iii) The magnetic ﬁeld has time to grow on Larmor scales
and produce Bohm-like diﬀusion as indicated by observation
(Stage et al 2006, Uchiyama et al 2007).
(iv) The magnetic energy density has time to reach large
values upstream of the shock on all scales.

Non-relativistic shocks have advantages over ultra-
relativistic shocks for particle acceleration, but the diﬃculty
with non-relativistic shocks is that the accelerating electric

8

ﬁeld (∝ ushB) is reduced by the ratio of the shock velocity
ush to the CR velocity c. Also, the CR current is reduced
by ∼ ush/c, thus reducing instability growth rates (Bell et
al 2013). Shocks with ush (cid:28) c, as in Sedov-phase SNR, do
not accelerate CR to high energies (Bell 2015).

Consequently, it appears that if shocks are to accelerate
UHECR they probably must have velocities less than c by
a factor of a few, but not by a factor very much larger than
this. An important question is just how much less than c
the shock velocity must be for eﬀective particle acceleration.
Araudo et al (2015, 2016) show from observations that ex-
tragalactic jet termination shocks with velocities around c/3
are poor accelerators. Similarly, the highest velocity SNR
(ush ∼ c/10 − c/5) have steep synchrotron spectra indi-
cating ineﬀective CR acceleration (Bell et al, 2011). These
observations suggest that ush ∼ c/5 might be optimal for
CR acceleration, but these cases might be special since in
both cases the shocks may be perpendicular. In the case
of extragalactic jets, the magnetic ﬁeld in the jet might be
predominantly toroidal. Similarly, young fast SNR may ex-
pand into a magnetic ﬁeld in the form of a Parker spiral.
Mildly relativistic shocks (ush ∼ c/5 − c/2) expanding into
a randomly orientated magnetic ﬁeld are equally likely to
be quasi-perpendicular or quasi-parallel. From theory and
simulations it is known that the CR energy spectrum at
mildly relativistic shocks can be either ﬂattened or steep-
ened relative to T −2 with a spectral index dependent on the
obliqueness of the shock (Kirk & Heavens 1989, Bell et al,
2011). It is possible that mildly relativistic parallel, but not
perpendicular, shocks might be good UHECR accelerators.

that the maximum CR energy is further reduced to Ts when
the departure from Bohm diﬀusion due to the small spatial
scale-size s of the magnetic ﬁeld is allowed for. In Section
5 we derived an expression for the maximum CR energy
TNRH,⊥ & TNRH,(cid:107) when the condition is applied that there
must be time for the magnetic ﬁeld to be ampliﬁed by the
NRH instability. The maximum CR energy is particularly
reduced in the case of quasi-perpendicular shocks character-
istic of relativistic ﬂows. TBohm and Ts are upper limits to
the maximum CR energy since both are derived for paral-
lel shocks and neither allows for the additional limitations
imposed by the time needed to amplify the magnetic ﬁeld.
TNRH,⊥ may oﬀer a reasonable estimate of the maximum
CR energy, but other factors may intervene to further limit
acceleration and make this also an upper limit. As shown in
ﬁgure 1, TNRH,⊥ depends strongly on the spectral index β
of the CR energy distribution since the NRH instability is
driven by the electric current carried by high energy CR.

Our overall conclusion is that if UHECR are accelerated
by shocks then the shocks are probably non-relativistic, or
possibly mildly relativistic, but not ultra-relativistic. The
strongest limit on the maximum CR energy arises from the
need to amplify a turbulent magnetic ﬁeld within one Lar-
mor radius of the shock. The maximum CR energy is larger
if the shock is parallel, but parallel relativistic shocks are a
special and unlikely case. The maximum CR energy is also
potentially larger if the upstream plasma is unmagnetized
such that the CR Larmor radius is larger than the size R of
the shock, but in this case the need for a large shock power
limits the CR energy.

7 THE ACCELERATION OF HEAVY NUCLEI

9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thus far throughout the paper we have considered only the
acceleration of protons. If an upstream plasma consisted en-
tirely of fully ionized atoms with charge Ze and mass Zmp
(A = Z), with ion number density ni in the shock rest frame,
it would behave exactly the same as a plasma consisting en-
tirely of fully ionized hydrogen with number density Zni
except that the energies of individual nuclei would be Z
times larger. The situation can be more complicated when
the plasma consists of a mix of species with diﬀerent A/Z
at diﬀerent energies as observed by the Auger array (Molina
Bueno et al 2015). The plasma turbulence will be driven
by CR with the largest current density, which can be ex-
pected to be protons in most cases. The ampliﬁed magnetic
ﬁeld would have an amplitude and scalelength determined
by protons, their injection eﬃciency, their spectra, their spa-
tial distribution, and their maximum energy. It is not clear
how this aﬀects the acceleration of nuclei with a diﬀerent
A/Z, but in general one can still expect heavier nuclei to be
accelerated to higher energy than protons.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the maximum energy of CR accelerated
by relativistic shocks falls far short of the Hillas energy. In
Section 3 we derived an expression for the maximum CR
energy TBohm as reduced by the steepness of the CR spec-
trum but assuming Bohm diﬀusion. In Section 4 we showed
