Abstract 

Ion sputtering induced nanoscale pattern formation on Ge (001) surface by 500 eV 

Ar+ bombardment has been investigated for a wide range of ion incidence angles at 

temperature of 3000C. A fourfold symmetric topography forms in the angular regime 

0  -  650.  Above  650,  they  show  a  remarkable  transition  into  highly  regular  one-

dimensional  (1D)  asymmetric  pattern,  known  as  perpendicular  mode  ripples.  In 

order to understand growth dynamics of both kind of patterns, we have investigated 

their temporal evolution as a function of ion fluence in a wide range from 1  1017 

to 1  1020 ions cm-2. In addition, we study the effect of substrate rotation on Ge 

surface morphology in whole angular range. The four-fold symmetric patterns effect 

does  not  found  to  alter  their  symmetry,  while  the  ripples  degenerate  into  hole 

structure with a weak fourfold symmetric pattern. The origin of square topographies 

and their symmetry independency on ion incident angle in the range 00 to 650 can be 

attributed to the  growth process due to biased diffusion of vacancies arising  from

1. Introduction 

Low energy ion beam sputtering (IBS) on solid is known to be a simple technique 

for  producing  self-organized  structures  in  the  nanometer  length  scale.  It  is 

advantageous  for  its ability of  nanostructuring  in  large area (order of cm2) within 

few  minutes  in  just  one  step  without  any  mask,  resist  or  chemical  hazards.  Two-

dimensional  dot  and  one-dimensional  ripple  topographies  are  generally  found  to 

develop on the surfaces of semiconductors due to IBS at room temperature [1-6]. 

Experimentally, the pattern formation has been studied mostly with Si [3-8] because 

of its easy availability and technological importance in semiconductor industry [9]. 

Ge  is  also  noteworthy  in  device  fabrication  technology  [10],  instead  only  a  few 

works of Ge nanostructuring via the one step IBS are reported so far [3, 11-18] where 

the formation of swelling at normal incidence angle (e.g. [16]) and ripple and faceted 

pattern at high incidence angles are observed. These experiments were carried out at 

room temperature and unfortunately, the room temperature IBS of semiconductors 

causes  surface  amorphization  which  significantly  limits  its  electrical  conductivity 

and  hence,  deteriorates  the  functionality  of  the  nanoscale  devices.  However,  the 

crystallinity of the sample can be maintained if the irradiation is performed near or 

above the recrystallization temperature or can be recovered by post-bombardment 

annealing  of  the  sample.  In  the  former  case,  the  dynamic  annealing  of  the  ion-

induced  defects  keeps  the  sample  crystalline  and  texturing  becomes  well-ordered 

3 

 
 
and nearly defect-free. Such crystalline Ge nanostructures exhibit high potential in 

different activities, ranging from optics to optoelectronics [19], thermoelectrics [20], 

photovoltaics  [21,  22],  energy  storage  devices  [23]  etc.  Another  advantage  of  the 

high temperature irradiation is the activation of the terrace diffusion barrier known 

as Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier [24, 25] which produces a new kind of surface 

instability  behind  the  formation  of  nanopattern.  The  ES  barrier  at  the  step  edges 

causes anisotropic surface diffusion of adatoms and vacancies created by ion impact, 

which results in the growth of  instabilities perpendicular to the step direction and 

develops  structures  according  to  the  symmetry  and  orientation  of  the  crystal  face 

[26]. 

Recently, the ES barrier induced pattern formation on Ge crystal surface by 

means  of  IBS  at  high  temperature  attracts  considerable  attention  [27-31].  The 

remarkable work of Ou et al. [27] on hot Ge by 1 keV Ar+ sputtering illustrates the 

formation of ES barrier driven dense arrays of  crystalline  alternating  mounds and 

pits,  resembling  homoepitaxial  growth  of  checkerboard  structure  as  obtained  in 

molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [32]. In our earlier work [28], we also demonstrated 

the  similar  kind  of  pattern  formation  through  the  Ar+  sputtering  near  the  sputter-

threshold  energy  ~  30  eV.  Since  both  the  investigations  were  done  at  normal  ion 

beam incidence, it highly motivates us to extend the pattern formation study at off-

normal angle of incidences, especially at grazing incidence angles, in order to realize 

4 

 
 
whether  such  diffusion-bias-generated  instability  can  influence  the  morphological 

evolution  at  grazing  incidence  too  or  some  other  physical  phenomena  takes  over. 

For  the  further  understanding  of  the  pattern  formation  mechanism,  one  of  the 

approach  is  to  study  the  evolution  dynamics  of  patterns  due  to  off-normal  ion 

incidences on Ge at elevated temperature which have not receive attention so far. 

In this paper, we represent the evolution of nanoscale patterns of Ge (001) for 

whole angular range 00 to 850 by 500 eV Ar+ IBS at high temperature. We observed 

four-fold symmetric checkerboard morphology  which sustains up to the incidence 

angle of 650 and after that there is a transition to a two-fold symmetric ripple pattern 

is observed. The four-fold symmetric pattern remains unaffected when the substrate 

is  rotated  during  ion  irradiation,  thus  showing  the  importance  of  anisotropic 

diffusion dynamics similar to those involved in the case of MBE. On the other hand, 

the  substrate  rotation  breaks  the  two-fold  symmetric  ripple  morphology  thereby 

revealing  the  dominance  of  curvature-dependent  sputtering  mechanism  at  high 

incidence angles. We also studied the growth dynamics of both of these structures 

by examining their temporal evolution as a function of ion fluence ranging from 1  

1017 to 1  1020 ions cm-2. Here, we choose ion energy for irradiation low (~ 500 eV) 

because  of  their  low  penetration  depth  in  solid  (~2  nm  in  Ge  according  to  SRIM 

2008 [33]) which in turn yields less amorphization and thus, easy to regain surface 

crystallinity upon annealing. The importance and usefulness of crystalline patterns 

5 

 
 
from application perspective is already discussed before. Going low beyond 500 eV 

in  our  equipment  will  reduce  the  ion  current  density  which  in  consequence  will 

increase the sputtering time a lot to reach the range of high ion fluences (~ 1020 cm-

2) chosen in this investigation. 

3. Experimental 

Ion  irradiation  were  carried  out  on  commercially  available  epi-polished  Ge  (001) 

wafers  with  a  beam  of  diameter  4  cm  extracted  from  an  inductively  coupled  RF 

discharge ion source (M/s Roth & Rau Microsystems GmbH, Germany) [4]. Before 

irradiation, the wafers were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone followed by methanol 

for 5 min in each. During irradiation, the chamber pressure was reduced to 10-4 mbar, 

while usually the base pressure remains around 10-8 mbar. Ion incidence angle was 

varied  from 0-90 with respect to substrate normal. There is also the provision to 

rotate  azimuthally  the  substrate  chuck  around  its  axis  at  the  speed  of  5  rpm.  A 

schematic  diagram  of  ion  beam  irradiation  geometry  is  depicted  in  fig.  1.  The 

irradiation  was  performed  at  3000C  which  is  well  above  the  recrystallization 

temperature (Tc) of Ge (Tc  2700C) [34]. Substrate temperature was raised using a 

radiation  heater  mounted  at  the  top  of  the  chamber  which  can  increase  the 

temperature  up  to  450C.  The  surface  temperature  was  measured  by  a  calibrated 

thermocouple  mounted  behind  the  target  holder.  Care  has  been  taken  to  prevent 

surface contamination with metallic impurities from the chamber wall or the ion-

 -source.  Ion  current  density  was  kept  constant  around  1000  A  cm-2.  After 

irradiation,  the  surface  topography  was  examined  by  atomic  force  microscope 

(VeccoNanoscope IV multimode microscope) under ambient condition operating in 

tapping mode with Si cantilevers of nominal tip radius 10 nm. The crystalline quality 

of  the  irradiated  surface  was  checked  by  cross-sectional  transmission  electron 

microscopy. For room temperature bombardment a thin amorphous layer (~ 2 nm) 

was  formed  on  the  surface,  which  was  found  absent  when  the  experiment  was 

performed at high temperature (3000 C). 

4. Results and discussion 

Figure 1 shows the influence of the incidence angle () on the evolution of the Ge 

surface topography irradiated with 500 eV Ar+ ions at elevated temperature 300C

and  ion  fluence  1    1019  ions  cm-2.  To  realize  Ge  morphological  variation  due  to 

identical bombardment situation at room temperature, one can see Ref. 18 where we 

reported parallel mode ripples from  = 65-75 and perpendicular mode ripples at 

85 respectively. The pattern formation was explained in the framework of curvature 

dependent  ion  erosion  and  smoothening  via  surface  diffusion  [35].  In  the  present 

case of ion irradiation at target temperature 3000C, we observe four-fold symmetric 

checkerboard  patterns  at  normal  incidence  due.  The  pattern’s  shape  is  found 

rectangular with an orientation in the <100> direction. The roughness increases to 

about  3.5  nm  compared  to  virgin  Ge  surface  roughness.  With  increase  of  ion 

incidence  angle,  these  structures  retain  their  four-fold  symmetry  up  to  650  with  a 

slight decrease of  the average  rms roughness to 2.75 nm. In addition, from 150 to 

350,  the  structures  are  found  to  hold  square  shape  which  again  start  to  show 

elongation in the beam direction from 45 onwards. The elongation becomes more 

prominent after   650 and finally a ripple-like structure appears at  = 700. Here, 

the  roughness  shows  a  maximum  of  4.25  nm.  The  wave-vector  of  the  ripples  are 

found to orient along perpendicular direction of ion beam projection and thus, named 

as perpendicular mode ripples. Beyond 700, the ripple’s regularity gets better and a 

sharp fall of roughness is observed. With further increase of incidence angle at 850, 

the ripples become fainted and the surface become almost smooth again. A further 

drop of surface roughness is also seen.  

8 

 
 
For further studies of the order, symmetry and orientation of the nanopattern, 

we evaluate the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and two-dimensional angle distribution 

for different angles of incidence from the corresponding AFM images (fig. 1). These 

are shown at the left side of each AFM images. Both the distributions show a clear 

signature  of  facet  formation.  At  low  angles,  the  FFTs  in  reciprocal  space  exhibit 

fourfold  symmetric  central  spot  with  edges  oriented  along  the  <100>  crystal 

directions. Also, the angle distribution shows four distinct peaks which  indicate a 

clear  signature  of  the  facet  formation  tilted  away  from  the  high-symmetry 

orientation.  

Fig. 1: Ion incidence angle dependence of IBS on Ge surface at 3000 C 500 eV Ar+  Ge ; ion current 

density  =  1000  A  cm-2  and  ion  fluence  =  11019  ions.cm-2  .  The  corresponding  FFT  and  2D  angle 

distribution are shown left side of the AFM images. Black arrow indicates the incident ion beam direction. 

The left top corner AFM image (a) is at room temperaure irradiation. Height scales are in nm. 

9 

 
 
 
 
As the incident angle increases beyond 450, the 2D-FFT and 2D slope distribution 

are  started  to  get  squeezed  in  the  vertical  direction  indicating  the  gradual 

transformation to two dimensional facet structures (nanoripple) with the orientation 

parallel to the incident beam direction. Finally at 850 irradiation, although the surface 

turns out to be flat as revealed from the corresponding AFM image, the central spot 

of  the  corresponding  FFT  shows  an  elongated  structure  perpendicular  to  the 

direction of ion beam projection thus revealing the reminiscence of the presence of 

perpendicular mode ripples on the surface. 

All the above described observations can be quantitatively visualized from the 

variation  of  different  surface  characteristics,  rms  roughness  (Rq),  wavelength  and 

facet angle against . We calculate the rms roughness or the interface width from the 

height-height correlation function defined as 𝐺(𝒓) ≡ 〈[ℎ𝑖 − ℎ𝑗]

2

〉 where ℎ𝑖 and ℎ𝑗 

are the heights corresponds to two surface positions separated by a lateral distance 

𝒓. For 𝒓 ≪ 𝜉, 𝐺(𝒓, 𝑡) scales linearly with 𝒓 as 𝒓2𝛼 and for 𝒓 ≫ 𝜉, √𝐺(𝒓)/2 gives a 

measure of the rms roughness, where  𝜉 and 𝛼 are known as the lateral correlation 

length  and  the  roughness  exponent,  respectively.  For  the  patterned  structures, 

calculations  of  𝐺(𝒓)  along  the  direction  of  pattern’s  repetition  show  a  number  of 

oscillations after the linear part of the curve where the first minimum provides the 

repeat distance between two consecutive height maxima.

Fig.  2:  Ion  incidence  angle  dependent  morphological  characteristics  on  Ge(100)  surface  at  implant 

temperature 3000C during Ar+ ion beam sputtering; ion energy = 500 eV, ion current density = 1000  A 

cm-2 and ion fluence = 11019 ions.cm-2. 

In our experiment, the patterns in between 00 to 650 are four fold symmetric mound 

and pits and beyond that, patterns show repetition in perpendicular direction of the 

ion  beam  projection  on  surface.  Thus,  we  extract  𝐺(𝒓)  directly  from  the  AFM 

micrographs  assigned  for  different  ion  incidence  angles  along  the  mentioned 

direction  and  plot  them  in  Fig.  2(a)  as  √𝐺(𝒓, 𝑡)  versus  𝒓  in  logarithmic  scale. 

Expectedly,  the  curves  show  periodic  oscillations  from  00  to  800  as  the  surface 

morphologies consists of the periodic repetition of height modulation. From the first 

11 

 
 
 
minimum, we extract the wavelength () of patterns and plot in fig. 2(b) as function 

of incidence angle . The overall variation of  is found to be similar as observed 

for surface roughness. For small values of  (up to 150),  is found around 110 nm 

which  decreases  a  bit  to  95  nm  from  250  to  550.  Then,    shows  an  increase  with 

increase of  and reaches a maximum of 260 nm at 750. After that, it shows a sudden 

drop and finally ended with 120 nm at 80. We also calculate roughness exponent  

from the linear part of √𝐺(𝒓, 𝑡) versus 𝒓 curve for each ion incidence angles which 

are displaed in fig. 2(b). From angular range 0 to 700,  value is found 0.95  0.01 

which  closely  corresponds  to  the  theoretically  predicted  value  for  a  Schwoebel 

barrier-induced roughening instability [36].  

Furthermore,  we  analyse  the  facet  angles  from  the  two-dimensional  slope 

distributions and its variation with  is displayed in fig. 2(d). Up to the incidence 

angle of 350, the facets forms angles about 90 with the (001) surface which plausibly 

be assigned to plane {106}. Such selection of slope in the continuum description of 

kinetic  instabilities  is, again, related  to  the Schwoebel barrier  and  is consistent  to 

those observed in Ge homoepitaxy [37-39]. From 450 to 650, where the checkerboard 

pattern  starts  showing  elongation  along  the  beam  direction,  the  facet  angle  value 

drops around 60 which might corresponds to the development of {109} plane. For 

further increase of incidence angles,  ≥ 700, the facet angle value is again decreased 

12 

 
 
and  finally  reaches almost  null  value at 850 which characterizes a smooth surface 

and is found in conformity with the roughness variation presented in fig. 2(b).  

The above described morphological details indicate that the ES barrier instability 

is responsible for pattern formation up to incidence angle 650, the existence of which 

is  found  only  on  crystalline  surface.  In  order  to  ascertain  the  role  of  surface 

crystallinity in pattern formation, we rotate the substrate around its surface normal 

azimuthally with a constant speed of 5 rpm after fixing it at the respective angles of 

ion bombardment. 

Fig. 3: Result of substrate rotation 5 rpm on the evolution of nanopatterns on Ge (100) surface at different 

ion incidence angles and temperature 3000 C; ion energy = 500 eV, ion current density = 1000 A cm-2 and 

ion  fluence  =  11019  ions.cm-2.  At  the  left  of  the  AFM  images,  the  corresponding  FFT  and  2D  angle 

distribution are shown. Height scales are in nm. 

13 

 
 
This scenario becomes equivalent to the system where the substrate with a certain 

tilt is bombarded homogeneously by an ion beam through all azimuthal angles. The 

results  are  represented  in  fig.  3.  The  AFM  images,  their  corresponding  FFT  and 

angle distribution up to   650, confirms that the symmetry of the pattern remains 

similar to those obtained for the non-rotating target.  This clearly indicates that the 

four-fold  symmetric  checkerboard  patterns  are  influenced  only  by  the  substrate 

crystallography  i.e.,  by  the  ES  barrier  instability  and  not  by  the  incident  beam 

direction.    However, after  = 650, the results are different;  the anisotropic ripple 

morphology  following  rotation  degenerates  into  hole/pit  structure  with  feeble 

reminiscence of four-fold symmetry. Consequently, the corresponding FFT images 

and the angular distributions show a weak four-fold symmetric structure. At more 

grazing incidence angle  of 800, these pits grow larger  in size and at 850, a few of 

them  sustains  as  isolated  large  shallow  square  pits  on  surface.  From  the  above 

results,  one  may  say  that,  beyond  the  incidence  angle  650,  pattern  formation  is 

dominated by the ion beam direction with respect to the surface normal with weak 

presence of ES barrier surface instability.  

We may, therefore, conclude that two kinds of surface instability play the role in 

the development of  surface topography  in the present experimental conditions: (i) 

the  Ehrlich-Schwoebel  (ES)  barrier  induced  surface  instability  at  incident  angles 

close  to  normal,  and  (ii)  the  curvature  dependent  surface  instability  at  grazing 

14 

 
 
incident  angles.  The  ion  incidence  angle      700  can  be  thought  as  the  transition 

angle from the ES barrier instability to curvature dependent ion beam instability for 

Ge surface at 3000C implantation temperature.  

We also analyses the  morphological characteristics influenced by the substrate 

rotation  at  each  incidence  angles  in  order  to  understand  the  effect  of  substrate 

rotation  (SR)  on  surface  topographies  in  contrast  to  the  static/non-rotating  (NR) 

condition.

the Ge surface morphologies as function of ion incidence angle with constant substrate rotation 5 rpm at 

3000 C during Ar+ ion beam sputtering; ion energy = 500 eV, ion current density = 1000 A cm-2 and ion 

fluence = 11019 ions.cm-2. 

15 

 
 
 
Surface roughnes Rq(SR), wavelength SR and roughness exponent SR are determined 

from the height-height correlation functions (the curves are not shown here) similar 

to those discussed for NR case and are plotted in fig. 4(a), (b) and (c) respectively 

as  a  function  of  incidence  angle  .  We  also  calculate  facet  angles  from  the 

corresponding slope distributions, which are displayed in fig. 4 (d). The results show 

some  differences  with  the  NR  case  (cf.,  fig.  2).  The  Rq(SR) versus    shows  a  bell-

shaped  type  variation  with  a  maximum  at  700  similar  to  Rq(NR),  but  exhibits  less 

roughness amplitude up to 650 and higher afterwards with respect to NR case. On 

the other hand, the wavelength of the nanostructures SR remains constant up to 650 

followed by a sudden rise at 700 (fig. 4b). This trend looks similar to that observed 

in  NR  case  (Fig.  2b).  However,  the  SR  values  are  found  lower  than  the 

corresponding NR. After  = 70, the weakly ordered pits exhibit  no more spatial 

correlation among them which makes the extraction of its wavelength not feasible. 

Figure 4(c) shows the variation of roughness exponent SR with , which again show 

similar kind of variation as observed in NR case.  The SR exhibits a value around 

0.95  up  to  700  followed  by  a  sharp  fall  with  further  increase  of  ,  which  might 

indicate  the  transition  from  ES  biased  instability  to  curvature  dependent  surface 

instability.  

In  order  to  further  illuminate  the  pattern  formation  mechanism,  we  have 

investigated the temporal evolution of the checkerboard pattern at oblique incidence 

16 

 
 
angles  = 150 and 650 and also, of the perpendicular mode ripples at 800. The results 

are  presented  in  figs.  5(a  -  e),  (f  -  j)  and  (k  -  o)  respectively  where  each  of  them 

displayed  series  of  AFM  images  corresponding  to  different  ion  fluences.  All  the 

AFM  images  again  enclose  their  corresponding  FFT  and  two  dimensional  angle 

distribution.

the corresponding FFT images and 2D angle  distributions are  included. Height scales are in  nm.  White 

arrow indicates the incident ion beam direction. 

17 

 
 
 
First,  the  results  for  150  will  be  described  and  then  650  and  800  will  be 

uncovered in sequence. For ion irradiation at  = 150 and at temperature of 3000C, 

we observe no development of distinctive surface morphology [fig. 5(a)] at initial 

ion fluence 11017 ions.cm-2. Consequently, the FFT as well as the angle distribution 

both are found isotropic. The increase of ion fluence to 51017 ions.cm-2 leads a faint 

topography  of  mound structures with  no clear preference  in orientation.  Also, the 

corresponding FFT accordingly displays almost isotropic central spot but the angle 

distribution starts to demonstrate four-fold symmetric distribution [fig. 5(b)]. A clear 

four-fold symmetric pattern of alternate mounds and pits with an orientation along 

<100> crystal direction is found to develop at fluence 11019 ions.cm-2, although the 

four fold symmetry in FFT becomes more clear from fluence 51018 ions.cm-2. As 

we move to  = 650, the surface morphology tends to demonstrate random pits at the 

early  fluence  regime  from  8.61017  to  2.21018  ions.cm-2  [a  representative  AFM 

image is only shown for fluence 8.61017 ions.cm-2 (fig. 5(f))]. Further increase of 

fluence  to  31018  ions.cm-2  leads  four-fold  symmetric  patterns  with  a  slight 

elongation along the  ion beam direction.  This behaviour  is also confirmed by the 

corresponding  FFT  image  and  the  angle  distribution  as  both  of  them  display 

elongated  central  spot  perpendicular  to  ion  beam  direction.  The  alignment  of  the 

patterns along the direction of ion beam gets more pronounced with the increase of 

ion fluence as seen from the AFM images [figs. 5(h) – (j)]. This characteristic is also 

18 

 
 
reflected in both the FFT and angle distribution showing the increase of squeezing 

of the central spot along the respective direction. At grazing ion incidence of 800 the 

AFM image reveals again a smooth surface at lower fluences, although the signature 

of  the  perpendicular  mode  ripple  can  be  confirmed  from  both  the  FFT  and  angle 

distribution images [fig. 5(k)]. At high ion fluence 11019 ions.cm-2 [fig. 5(m)], the 

ripples become pronounced but comprises a number of topological defects, e.g., the 

lateral merging of the two ripple ridges into Y-like junctions. Further increase of ion 

fluence greatly reduces the number of defects and enhances the ripple ordering.  

In  order  to  know  quantitatively  the  morphological  characteristics  of  the 

evolved patterns at  = 150, 650 and 800, we have extracted the rms roughness (Rq), 

wavelength  ()  and  the  facet  angle  of  the  patterns  from  the  corresponding  AFM 

images and the data are plotted as a function of ion fluence () in figs. 6 (a) – (c), 

(d) – (f) and (g) – (i), respectively. For  = 15, Rq is found to remain constant up to 

the fluence 51017 ions.cm-2 [fig. 6(a)]. After which it shows increase with increase 

of  following a power law Rq   with growth exponent  = 0.69  0.11 and reaches 

a  saturated  value  around  3.6  nm  at      11019  ions.cm-2.  On  the  other  hand,  the 

wavelength () and the facet angle, both show an increase from the beginning and 

saturates  at  fluences      11019  ions.cm-2  similar  to  that  observed  for  the  surface 

roughness. The increment of  from 58 to 120 nm occurs with coarsening exponent 

19 

 
 
n = 0.24  0.03 (  n), whereas the facet angle initially showing a sharp increase 

and saturates around 90. 

Fig. 6: The RMS roughness, wavelength and facet angle as function of ion fluence for incidence angle 15 

(top row: a-c), 65 (middle row: d-f) and 80 (bottom row: g-i) respectively for 500 eV Ar+ ion irradiation 

on Ge surface at implant temperature 300C. 

For 650 angle of incidence, where the elongated checkerboard patterns are formed, 

Rq,  and the facet angle all of them increase initially and finally saturates at the high 

fluence   11019 ions.cm-2. Moreover, Rq and  exhibit growth () and coarsening 

(n) exponent as 0.77  0.45 and 0.35  0.04, respectively and their saturated values 

corresponds to 4.5 nm and 140 nm, respectively. The saturation value for facet angle 

20 

 
 
is found around 50. In case of the evolution of the perpendicular mode ripples at  = 

80, Rq displays a constant value for initial ion fluences up to  = 11019 ions.cm-2 

and then shows increase with growth exponent =0.73  0.04. On the other hand, 

the increment of  with ion fluence exhibits the coarsening exponent 0.17   0.02. 

However, no saturation is observed for both Rq and  up to the highest ion fluence 

of 51019 ions.cm-2. In contrast to Rq and , the facet angle shows saturation around 

8 after an initial increase with ion fluence. 

Summary 

In  summary,  we  study  the  pattern  formation  on  Ge  surface  by  low-energy  ion 

irradiation above the dynamic recrystallization temperature 300C. Up to incidence 

angle  650,  crystalline  four-fold  symmetric  ordered  nanostructures  are  found  to 

develop which resemble the checkerboard patterns observed in case of homoepitaxy. 

In between, from incidence angle 45, the patterns show slight elongation along the 

ion  beam  projection  on  surface  which  becomes  prominent  at  more  grazing 

incidences and  finally results  highly  regular perpendicular  mode  ripples from 75 

onwards.  The  growth  dynamics  study  reveals  that,  for  initial  ion  fluences,  the 

amplitude of the patterns grows more rapidly at higher off-normal incidences (65 ~ 

0.77  0.45 > 15 ~ 0.69  0.11, where checkerboard patterns develops) below the 

critical angle of pattern  transition  C ~ 70 and after which  the  growth rate slows 

21 

 
 
down a bit with exponent value 80 ~ 0.73  0.04 (where perpendicular mode ripples 

occur).  On  the  other  hand,  for  high  ion  fluences,  the  pattern’s  amplitude  leans 

towards saturation where the fluence value to reach saturation is  found to shift to 

higher value for larger angle of ion incidence independent of angular regime above 

or  below  C.  For  instance,  the  evolution  of  checkerboard  patterns  at  15  shows 

saturation at fluence 11019 ion.cm-2 whereas the perpendicular mode ripples at 80 

do  not  even  saturation  even  at  comparatively  five  times  higher  ion  fluence  value 

51019 ion.cm-2. Moreover,  the checkerboard patterns are found to retain  its  four-

fold symmetry due to concurrent sample rotation during ion irradiation. At the same 

circumstance,  the  perpendicular  mode  ripples  completely  loses  its  two  fold 

symmetry and results into pit structures with a weak four-fold symmetry. The overall 

morphological  variation  indicates that at  low angles of  ion  irradiation, the kinetic 

instability is largely influenced by the surface diffusion of vacancies due to presence 

of ES barrier, whereas at grazing incidence angles, the surface curvature dependent 

ion beam induced instability dominates.
