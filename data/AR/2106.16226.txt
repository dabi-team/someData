We for the ﬁrst time map the range of active-sterile neutrino mixing angles in which leptogenesis
is possible in the type I seesaw model with three heavy neutrinos with Majorana masses between 50
MeV and 70 TeV, covering the entire experimentally accessible mass range. Our study includes both,
the asymmetry generation during freeze-in (ARS mechanism) and freeze-out (resonant leptotenesis)
of the heavy neutrinos. The range of mixings for which leptogenesis is feasible is considerably larger
than in the minimal model with only two heavy neutrinos and extends all the way up to the current
experimental bounds. For such large mixing angles the HL-LHC could potentially observe a number
of events that is large enough to compare diﬀerent decay channels, a ﬁrst step towards testing the
hypothesis that these particles may be responsible for the origin of matter and neutrino masses.

Introduction: Right-handed neutrinos νR appear in
many extensions of the Standard Model (SM) of particle
physics [1–5] and could solve several of its shortcomings [6].
Amongst others,1 they can explain the masses of ordinary
neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism [12–17] and generate
the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the observable uni-
verse [18] through leptogenesis [19]. Both, the number n
of ﬂavours νRi and their Majorana masses Mi cannot be
ﬁxed by established theoretical principles without spec-
ifying the UV completion of the SM and may therefore
be treated as free parameters in an agnostic approach.
While the original idea of leptogenesis assumed Mi to be
much larger than the electroweak scale, it was realised
in the 90s and 2000s that leptogenesis is feasible for Mi
below the TeV scale [20–24], light enough to be produced
and discovered at particle accelerators [25–27] (see [28–
32] for reviews). The exciting possibility to probe the
common origin of neutrino mass and the visible matter in
the universe has triggered a growing experimental eﬀort
to search for heavy neutrinos including searches at the
LHC main detectors [33–36] as well as ﬁxed target ex-
peirments [37, 38]. Heavy neutrinos have also become an
important benchmark model in the physics case studies
of proposed future detectors [39–41] (including SHiP [42],
MATHUSLA [43], FASER [44], CODEX-b [45]) and fu-
ture colliders, such as the FCC-ee [46] or CEPC [47].
From an experimental viewpoint the two most important
properties of the heavy neutrinos are their masses Mi
and their mixing angles θai = Faiv/Mi with ordinary neu-
trinos νLα (with v the Higgs vev), which determine the
strength of the weak interactions that the heavy neutrino
mass eigenstates Ni ∼ νRi + θαiνc
Lα feel. The mapping of

the viable leptogenesis parameter space and the perspec-
tives to probe it experimentally have been the subject of
numerous studies, cf. e.g. [32] for a review. Exhaustive
parameter space scans so far have almost entirely been
focused to scenarios that can eﬀectively be described by
the model with n = 2,2 the minimal scenario consistent
with light neutrino oscillation data. A third νRi is not
only needed to give mass to the lightest SM neutrino, but
also required in the context of many gauge extensions of
the SM to ensure the anomaly freedom of the theory. In
the present work we for the ﬁrst time identify the range
U 2
αi = |θαi|2 for which the extension of the SM by three νR
can simultaneously explain the light neutrino masses and
the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe across
the entire experimentally accessible mass range between
50 MeV and 70 TeV,3 where the lower limit is motivated
by the interplay between direct search bounds and cosmo-
logical bounds [50] ,4 covering the entire experimentally
accessible mass range.

with F a matrix of Yukawa couplings, MM a Majorana
mass matrix, and Φ and ‘L the SM Higgs and lepton
doublets, respectively. The model (1) should be regarded
as an eﬀective ﬁeld theory [57] with some cutoﬀ scale Λ,
which in principle could be as high as the Planck scale [58],
but may be considerably lower if it is e.g. associated with
the breaking of additional gauge symmetries. For instance,

1 They can e.g. also be Dark Matter (DM) candidates [7, 8]
(cf. e.g. [9, 10] for reviews) or explain oscillation anomalies [11].

2 The νMSM falls into this category because one of the Ni is a DM

candidate and has very small couplings, cf. [48].

3 For larger masses Eqs. (5) need to be modiﬁed to take the equili-

bration of right-handed electrons into account [49].

in the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) [12, 14, 59–62]
there is a viable corner in parameter space in which the Mi
are considerably below the WR mass [63]. In the present
work we remain agnostic regarding the UV completion
and simply assume that Λ is large enough to justify the
use of (1) at all relevant energies and temperatures T .
We focus on the case with three νR ﬂavours (n = 3)
with all Mi below 105 GeV.5 Though the Lagrangian (1)
is identical to the classic high-scale seesaw mechanism,
the smallness of the light neutrino masses in this case
cannot be explained by the ratio v/Mi, but instead is
typically related to approximate symmetries, which permit
to explain the light neutrino masses with Fai of order one
for sub-TeV values of the Mi. A popular choice is an
approximate B − ¯L conservation, with baryon number
B and some generalised lepton number ¯L under which
the νR are charged [64, 65]. Popular models that can
incorporate this idea e.g. include the inverse [66–69] and
linear [70, 71] seesaws, scale invariant models [72] and the
Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (νMSM) [64] proposed
in [23, 73]. A generic feature of these symmetries is
the appearance of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum of
Mi. While B − ¯L type symmetries typically enforce pair-
wise degeneracies amongst the eigenvalues of MM [74],
additional symmetries can imply that all eigenvalues are
degenerate [24, 75–77]. Previous work has shown that the
largest U 2
αi consistent with leptogenesis for n = 3 can be
achieved in this regime [78]. Since our goal is to identify
the largest and smallest U 2
αi for given Mi, we focus on the
case of three quasi-degenerate Mi ’ ¯M in the following.
In our study of the parameter space we employ the

usual Casas-Ibarra parametrization [79],

F =

(2)

where Uν is the PMNS matrix, mν and MM are the
mass matrices of the light and heavy neutrinos respec-
tively.6 The matrix R satisﬁes RRT = 1 and is usu-
ally parametrized by three complex Euler angles. Large
imaginary parts of these complex angles correspond to
large mixing angles U 2 and Yukawa couplings. In such
a parametrisation it is not immediately clear whether
the light neutrino masses remain stable under radiative
corrections, or how it is related to B − ¯L conserving sce-
narios. To make this connection more clear, in this work
we instead parametrize the matrix R as:

R = OνRCON ,

5 A discussion of theoretical motivations for a low scale seesaw can

e.g. be found in Sec. 5 of [41].

6 This parametrization can be modiﬁed to include radiative correc-
p ˜Mi [81], as well corrections

tions [80] by replacing
from unitarity of the mixing matrix [82].

RC = R(12)
(where the superscript indicates the plane of

tion as rotation by a complex angle ωc around some axis,
which is then rotated to the appropriate basis in νR and
νL-ﬂavor spaces (we note for completeness that any real
O(12)
can be absorbed into RC, giving us a
N
total of six physical parameters, same as in the complex
Euler angle parametrization). When written this way, a
large imaginary part of the angle in RC leads to a B − ¯L
conserving structure of the Yukawa couplings, as required
by [74], which is perturbed by the splittings between the
eigenvalues of MM . Explicitly, if we perform a ﬂavor
rotation of the Yukawa matrix by OT
N , up to corrections
of O(|Mi − Mj|), and O(e−| Im ωc|), the Yukawa couplings
are given by7

(4)

If all three neutrinos are quasi-degenerate, the matrix
ON can have signiﬁcant deviations from the unit matrix,
and all three mass eigenstates can have mixings of the
same order of magnitude. In this parametrisation, an
approximate mass degeneracy of the three HNLs is a
suﬃcient condition to ensure stability of the light neutrino
masses under radiative corrections, irrespective of the
choice of the matrix ON .

Low scale leptogenesis: The simplest thermal lep-
togenesis scenario requires Mi > 109 GeV [83], which
can be lowered by taking ﬂavour eﬀects into account [84].
Low scale leptogenesis can be made possible in diﬀerent
ways [85]. In the model (1) it is typically achieved by a res-
onant enhancement of the contributions from the Ni-mode
p to the asymmetry generation by a factor that roughly
scales as Γp/∆M [86], where Γp is the thermal width of the
Ni-mode p.8 In the non-relativistic regime this requires
quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum of Mi [88, 89], while
in the relativistic regime it is suﬃcient that T (cid:29) Mi [90].
It is common to distinguish between asymmetries that
are generated during the Ni’s approach to equilibrium
(“freeze-in mechanism”) and those generated during their
decay (“freeze-out mechanism”). Traditionally the latter
is associated with “resonant leptogenesis” [22, 24] while
the former is associated with “baryogenesis from neutrino
oscillations” [21, 23], but in general both mechanisms

7 The special case of n = 2 is realised in the limit mlightest = 0,
with ON ≈ 1, where νR1 and νR2 form a pseudo-Dirac pair and
Oν is a permutation matrix that depends on the light neutrino
mass ordering.

contribute (in particular in the weak washout regime),
and oscillations occur during both, freeze-in and freeze-
out [86].

A uniﬁed description of all scenarios under considera-
tion here can be achieved with matrix-valued quantum
kinetic equations (QKEs) for the heavy neutrinos and the
asymmetries in diﬀerent SM degrees of freedom, which
can be derived in diﬀerent ways [91, 92]. In the present
work we use the QKEs presented in [86],

Results: We solve the set of equations (5) for two
types of initial conditions for the Ni : i) vanishing abun-
dances or ii) thermal initial abundances. The former
apply in scenarios where the reheating temperature is
considerably lower than Λ, such as the νMSM, the latter
apply in scenarios where the νR have additional inter-
actions at high energies and the reheating temperature
is larger than Λ. In both cases we assume that all SM
chemical potentials vanish initially, cf. [95, 96] for a recent
discussion of this point.

The model (1) contains 7n − 3 free parameters, and the
equations (5) contain a large number of times scales that
can depend on all of them, making a complete exploration
of the parameter space numerically challenging. The
goal of the present work is a ﬁrst identiﬁcation of the
range of mixings U 2
α for
given ¯M for which a matter-antimatter asymmetry that
exceeds the current observational value of the baryon-to-
photon ratio [97] can be generated while simultaneously
explaining the light neutrino oscillation data without ﬁne-
tuning. For this purpose we focus on the case of normal
light neutrino mass ordering and separately consider the
two choices mlightest = 0 eV and mlightest = 0.1 eV. We ﬁx
all measured neutrino oscillation parameter to the best ﬁt
values presented in [98] and used uniform priors for the

α U 2

3

Dirac and Majorana phases in Uν as well as the real parts
of the rotation angles in R. For the imaginary part of the
rotation angle in RC we used a uniform prior between
−10 and 10. In each step of the scan we ﬁxed ¯M to a
particular value and randomised the relative deviations of
the eigenvalues in MM with uniform log10 priors between
−10 and −1.

We impose three criteria on all parameter points to
ensure the theoretical consistency of the computations.
Perturbative unitarity: For the Ni to be well deﬁned
as quasiparticles, we require their decay width to be
smaller than half their mass. Seesaw expansion: We
only consider points with U 2 < 0.1 to ensure that the
parameterisation (2) is approximately valid. No ﬁne
tuning. We require small radiative corrections for the
light neutrinos masses which suggests the presence of
an underlying B − ¯L symmetry. As discussed after (3),
this condition is automatically satisﬁed when all Mi are
quasi-degenerate.

The results of this scan are displayed in Fig. 1. As it
is the most important quantity from a phenomenological
viewpoint, we show the results in the ¯M −U 2 plane in this
Letter. We will present other representations of the 18-
dimensional parameter space and a detailed discussion in
a longer follow-up work. In Fig. 1 we compare this to the
reach of selected experiments in the ¯M − U 2
µ plane. This
is justiﬁed because we ﬁnd that the maximal allowed U 2
µ
tends to be very close to the maximal U 2 for given ¯M . In
contrast to that, the maximal U 2
e in the case mlightest = 0
is about an order of magnitude smaller, which can be
understood from Fig. 11 in [50] and is consistent with the
e /U 2 allowed by neutrino
known fact that the range of U 2
oscillation data is small for n = 2 [99–102].

Discussion and conclusion: Our main ﬁndings are

as follows:

1) For both types of initial conditions we ﬁnd that
leptogenesis with n = 3 is possible with U 2 that
are orders of magnitude larger than in the case
n = 2 [86, 110].

2) For thermal initial conditions leptogenesis is feasible
for masses as low as 1.7 GeV and U 2 that are acces-
sible to current experiments. For vanishing initial
conditions the lower bound on ¯M from leptogenesis
is weaker than that from experiments and BBN.
3) The maximal U 2 is larger for mlightest = 0 eV than

for mlightest = 0.1 eV.

4) For mlightest = 0 and ¯M > 102 GeV, we ﬁnd that
leptogenesis from thermal initial conditions can lead
to larger mixing angles than leptogenesis with van-
ishing initial Ni occupation numbers.

One of the most surprising outcomes of the parameter
scan is the observation 1) that the allowed mixing angles
in the scenario with three heavy neutrinos exceed the
leptogenesis bounds from the scenario with n = 2 [86] by
several orders of magnitude. A similar observation has

4

the νRi ﬂavor space can remain weakly coupled and can
have a much more signiﬁcant deviation from equilibrium.
This is in contrast to the case with n = 2, where both
reach equilibrium soon after they become non-relativistic
because they form a pseudo-Dirac pair. The deviation
from equilibrium during decays is typically of the order
δni ≈ ˙neq/Γ , where Γ ≈ Γ1 ≈ Γ2 is the inverse lifetime
of the two neutrinos νR1 and νR2 that form the pseudo-
Dirac pair with M2 ’ M3. If we include a third neutrino
νR3, its lifetime is not necessarily determined by the
mixing angle U 2, it can have a much bigger deviation
from equilibrium. If M3 is very diﬀerent from M2 and
M1, the B − ¯L symmetry dictates that νR1 and νR2 form
a pseudo-Dirac pair of mass eigenstates Ni (ﬁrst two
columns in (4)) with mixings of order U 2, while the third
mass eigenstate N3 remains feebly coupled (third column
in (4)). However, in the triple mass-degenerate scenario,
νR3 can mix with the pseudo-Dirac pair through the mass
term. This explains not only point 1), but also point 3)
because smaller mlightest allow for smaller couplings of νR3.
Regarding 2), leptogenesis with thermal initial conditions
is possible for ¯M (cid:28) v because the enhancement of the
asymmetry due to resonant and ﬂavour eﬀects can be
suﬃcient to overcome the suppression by ( ¯M /T )2 of the
deviation from equilibrium [86, 110–112].9 Finally, point
4) is a result of the well-known fact that the asymmetries
generated during freeze-in and freeze-out have opposite
signs [115] (cf. [116] for a recent discussion) and partially
cancel each other in the case of vanishing initial conditions.
The much larger range of masses and mixings for which
leptogenesis is feasible for n = 3 compared to n = 2
do not only imply considerably better chances for exist-
ing experiments to discover the Ni, but also imply that
a much larger number of them may be observed. The
price at which this comes is the larger number of model
parameters, which makes the model with n = 3 less pre-
dictive than with n = 2, where in principle all model
parameters can be constrained experimentally [99, 100].
In spite of this, with such a large number of events, one
can perform several consistency checks of the hypotheses
that the model (1) can simultaneously generate the light
neutrino masses and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in
the universe. For instance, if U 2 happens to lie near the
current experimental limit, we estimate (using the results
of [104]) that the HL-LHC could observe thousands of
displaced vertex events. This would permit a percent
level determination of the fractions U 2
α/U 2 (cf. appendix
B of [109]). Moreover, the amount of B − ¯L breaking

9 The late decay of the Ni in this scenario could potentially generate
a lepton asymmetry that greatly exceeds the baryon asymmetry,
which can have interesting phenomenological consequences, in-
cluding enhanced singlet fermion DM production [8] and aﬀect
the nature of the QCD transition [113] and primordial black hole
production [114].

been made in [78], where only the freeze-in and ¯M below
50 GeV were considered. Amongst the various diﬀerences
between n = 2 and n = 3 discussed in [78], two are most
relevant here. i) Lepton asymmetries can be preserved
from large washout by a ﬂavor hierarchical washout, since
the ratios U 2
i with n = 3 are much less constrained by
neutrino oscillation data than for n = 2 [50]. ii) Thermal
eﬀects can cause a level-crossing between the Ni dispersion
relations (similar to the well-known MSW eﬀect) that
resonantly enhances the asymmetry production, which
cannot be realised in the B − ¯L limit for n = 2. For the
freeze-out (where the Ni are non-relativistic) these two
eﬀects appear to play a much smaller role since we ﬁnd
a large population of points that do not satisfy either
of these two criteria. We instead ﬁnd that a crucial
element in preventing washout is that one direction in

can be studied by measuring the total ratio between lep-
ton number violating and conserving decays [117–122]
(cf. also [123, 124]), the dependence of this quantity on
Γ [125–127], the U 2
α/U 2 [128], or the Ni momentum distri-
bution [129–131]. Finally, parameters that are not directly
accessible (R, Majorana phases in Uν) may be accessed
by measuring the CP-violation in Ni decays [132], the
U 2
α/U 2 [100, 133] or neutrinoless double β-decay [99, 134–
137].

In summary, we for the ﬁrst time studied the range
of mixing angles U 2
α for which right-handed neutrinos
with Majorana masses below 100 TeV in the model (1)
can generate the light neutrino masses and the baryon
asymmetry of the universe. We considered both, the
cases of vanishing initial conditions that one would ﬁnd
in minimal models like the νMSM and thermal initial
conditions that one would expect in models with an ex-
tended gauge sector. We ﬁnd that this range is much
bigger than in the case of two right-handed neutrinos,
which opens up the possibility to see thousands of events
in existing experiments. When combined with data from
neutrino oscillation experiments and neutrinoless double
β-decay, this permits various consistency checks to test
the hypothesis that right-handed neutrinos are common
the origin of neutrino masses and baryonic matter in the
universe
