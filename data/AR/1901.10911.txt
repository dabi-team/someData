Abstract

The oddness of a cubic graph is the smallest number of odd circuits in a 2-factor
of the graph. This invariant is widely considered to be one of the most important
measures of uncolourability of cubic graphs and as such has been repeatedly reoc-
curring in numerous investigations of problems and conjectures surrounding snarks
(connected cubic graphs admitting no proper 3-edge-colouring). In [Ars Math. Con-
temp. 16 (2019), 277–298] we have proved that the smallest number of vertices of
a snark with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness 4 is 44. We now show that there

from subgraphs of the Petersen graph and a small number of additional vertices.
Depending on their structure they fall into six classes, each class giving rise to an
inﬁnite family of snarks with oddness at least 4 with increasing order. We explain
the reasons why these snarks have oddness 4 and prove that the 31 snarks form the
complete set of snarks with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness 4 on 44 vertices. The
proof is a combination of a purely theoretical approach with extensive computations
performed by a computer.

1 Introduction

This paper is a sequel of [8] where we have proved that the smallest number of vertices
of a snark – a connected cubic graph whose edges cannot be properly coloured with three
colours – which has cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness at least 4 is 44. The purpose of the
present paper is to show that there are precisely 31 such snarks, all of them having oddness
exactly 4, resistance 3, and girth 5. Together with [8], this paper provides a partial answer
to the following question posed in [4, Problem 2], leaving open the existence of cyclically
5-edge-connected snarks of oddness at least 4 on fewer than 44 vertices:
Problem [4]. Which is the smallest snark (with cyclic connectivity (cid:62) 4 and girth (cid:62) 5)
of oddness strictly greater than 2?

The oddness of a bridgeless cubic graph G is the smallest number of odd circuits in
a 2-factor of G, and the resistance of G is the smallest number of vertices (or edges)
of G whose removal yields a 3-edge-colourable graph. Both invariants are important
measures of uncolourability of cubic graphs and have been investigated by numerous
authors [1, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 25]. One of the reasons why these invariants have recently
received so much attention resides in the fact that snarks with large resistance or oddness
may provide potential counterexamples to several profound conjectures such as the cycle
double cover conjecture, the 5-ﬂow conjecture, and others [11, 13, 14].

The set M of all 31 snarks of order 44, cyclic connectivity 4, and oddness 4 has been
constructed with the help of a computer. A detailed description of its members appears
in Section 3 where we also give a computer-free proof that each of them has oddness at
least 4. The equality can be established easily by specifying a 2-factor containing four
odd circuits, which can be checked directly.

The snarks constituting the set M fall into six classes depending on their structure.
A remarkable feature of the set is that all of them are built up from subgraphs of the
Petersen graph and a small number of additional vertices. The veriﬁcation that M is a
complete set of snarks of order 44, cyclic connectivity 4, and oddness at least 4 combines
purely mathematical considerations with extensive computations; the proof can be found
in Section 4. Its mathematical part is essentially a mixture of edge-colouring and cyclic
connectivity arguments. In the computational part we perform an operation that takes

2

two cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks G1 and G2 of order at most 36 and creates from
them – in all possible ways – a cubic graph by either removing two adjacent vertices or
two nonadjacent edges, and connecting the resulting 2-valent vertices in G1 with those in
G2. In total, more than 2 × 1013 graphs have been constructed and checked for oddness 4.
The entire computational eﬀort for this project amounts to 25 CPU years.

In Section 5 we analyse a sample of 887 152 cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks of
oddness 4 whose orders range from 46 to 52, as well as 872 snarks of oddness 4 with lower
connectivity constructed in [9]. We evaluate various invariants for them such as resistance,
perfect matching index, circumference, and others. The purpose of this investigation is
to provide grounds for possible prediction of certain properties that snarks with higher
oddness might have in general.

We conclude this paper with several open problems. At the end we append the adja-

cency lists of all 31 snarks constituting the set M.

2 Preliminaries

This section collects the most basic deﬁnitions and notation needed for understanding the
present paper. For a more detailed introduction to the topic we refer the reader to our
preceding paper [8].

2.1. Graphs and multipoles. All graphs in this paper are ﬁnite and for the most
part simple. However, for the sake of completeness we have to permit graphs containing
multiple edges or loops, although these features will be usually excluded by the imposed
connectivity or colouring restrictions. For a graph G and a subgraph H ⊆ G we let |G|
denote the number of vertices of G, and G[H] the subgraph of G induced by the vertex
set of H.

Throughout this paper we use multipoles as a convenient tool for constructing graphs.
Every edge of a multipole has two ends and each end can, but need not, be incident
with a vertex. An edge which has one end incident with a vertex and the other not
is called a dangling edge, and if neither end of an edge is incident with a vertex, it is
called an isolated edge. An end of an edge that is not incident with a vertex is called
a semiedge. A multipole with k semiedges is called a k-pole. Two semiedges s and t
of a multipole can be joined to produce an edge s ∗ t connecting the end-vertices of the
corresponding dangling edges. Given two k-poles M and N with semiedges s1, . . . , sk and
t1, . . . , tk, respectively, we deﬁne their complete junction M ∗ N to be the graph obtained
by performing the junctions si ∗ ti for each i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. A partial junction is deﬁned
in a similar way except that a proper subset of semiedges of M is joined to semiedges
of N . Partial junctions can be used to construct larger multipoles from smaller ones. In
either case, whenever a junction of two multipoles is to be performed, we assume that
their semiedges are assigned a ﬁxed linear order.

Semiedges in multipoles are often grouped into pairwise disjoint sets, called connectors.
The size of a connector is the number of its semiedges. A connector of size n is often
referred to as an n-connector. An (n1, n2, . . . , nk)-pole is a multipole with n1 +n2 +· · ·+nk

2.2. Cyclic connectivity. Let G be a connected graph. An edge-cut of a graph G is
any set S of edges of G such that G − S is disconnected. For example, if H a proper
subset of vertices or induced subgraph of G, then the set δG(H) of all edges with exactly
one end in H is an edge-cut in G. An edge-cut S is said to be cycle-separating if at
least two components of G − S contain cycles. We say that a connected graph G is
cyclically k-edge-connected if no set of fewer than k edges is cycle-separating in G. Let
β(G) = |E(G)| − |V (G)| + 1 denote the cycle rank of G. The cyclic connectivity of G,
denoted by ζ(G), is the largest number k (cid:54) β(G) for which G is cyclically k-connected
(cf. [20, 22]). It is not diﬃcult to see that ζ(G) = β(G) if and only if G any two curcuits
of G have a vertex in common. For cubic graphs this can happen only when G is the
complete bipartite graph K3,3, the complete graph K4 on four vertices, or the graph
consisting of two vertices and three parallel edges joining them.

For a cubic graph G with ζ(G) (cid:54) 3, the value ζ(G) coincides with the usual vertex-
connectivity and edge-connectivity of G, so cyclic connectivity provides a natural exten-
sion of the classical connectivity parameters for cubic graphs. Another useful observation
is that the value of cyclic connectivity remains invariant under subdivisions and adjoining
new vertices of degree 1.
In particular, homeomorphic graphs have the same value of
cyclic connectivity.

For edge-cuts that separate an acyclic component from the rest of the graph we have

the following easy but useful observation.

Lemma 1. A connected acyclic k-pole has k − 2 vertices.

2.3. Edge-colourings. A 3-edge-colouring of a graph G is a mapping ϕ : E(G) →
{1, 2, 3} such that adjacent edges receive distinct colours; the same deﬁnition applies
to multipoles. A graph or a multipole which admits a 3-edge-colouring will be called
colourable, otherwise it will be called uncolourable. A 2-connected uncolourable cubic
graph is called a snark. A snark is nontrivial if it is cyclically 4-edge-connected and has
girth at least 5.

In the study of colourings of cubic graphs it is often convenient to take the colours
to be the non-zero elements of the group Z2 × Z2, because in this case 3-edge-colourings
correspond to nowhere-zero Z2 × Z2-ﬂows. We identify the colours (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1)
with 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

4

The following well known lemma – in fact, an immediate consequence of ﬂow continuity

– is a fundamental tool in the study of snarks.

Theorem 2. (Parity Lemma) Let M be a k-pole endowed with a proper 3-edge-colouring
with colours 1, 2, and 3. If the set of all semiedges of M contains ki edges of colour i for
i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, then

k1 ≡ k2 ≡ k3 ≡ k

(mod 2).

In this paper we study snarks that are far from being 3-edge-colourable. Two measures
of uncolourability are relevant for this paper. The oddness ω(G) of a bridgeless cubic
graph G is the smallest number of odd circuits in a 2-factor of G. The resistance ρ(G)
of a cubic graph G is the smallest number of vertices of G which have to be removed
in order to obtain a colourable graph. Somewhat surprisingly, the required number of
vertices to be deleted is the same as the number of edges that have to be deleted in order
to get a 3-edge-colourable graph (see [24, Theorem 2.7]). In fact, in many cases it is more
convenient to delete edges rather than vertices.

Obviously, if G is colourable, then ω(G) = ρ(G) = 0.

If G is uncolourable, then
both ω(G) (cid:62) 2 and ρ(G) (cid:62) 2. Observe that for every bridgeless cubic graph G we
have ρ(G) (cid:54) ω(G) since deleting one edge from each odd circuit in a 2-factor leaves a
colourable graph. On the other hand, the Parity Lemma implies that ρ(G) never equals 1,
which together with a standard Kempe chain recolouring argument yields that ρ(G) = 2
if and only if ω(G) = 2 [24, Lemma 2.5]. The diﬀerence between ω(G) and ρ(G) can be
arbitrarily large in general [25], nevertheless, resistance can serve as a convenient lower
bound for oddness because it is somewhat easier to handle.

By the Parity Lemma, every colouring of a 4-pole has one of the following types:
1111, 1122, 1212, and 1221 (for a precise deﬁnition of the type of a colouring see [8]).
Observe that every colourable 4-pole admits at least two diﬀerent types of colourings.
Indeed, we can start with any colouring and switch the colours along an arbitrary Kempe
chain to obtain a colouring of another type. Colourable 4-poles thus can have two, three,
or four diﬀerent types of colourings. Those attaining exactly two types are particularly
important for the study of snarks; we call them colour-open 4-poles, as opposed to colour-
closed multipoles discussed in more detail in [21].

There are two types of colour-open 4-poles. A 4-pole M will be called isochromatic
if its semiedges can be partitioned into two pairs such that in every colouring of M the
semiedges within each pair receive the same colour. A 4-pole M will be called heterochro-
matic of its semiedges can be partitioned into two pairs such that in every colouring of M
the semiedges within each pair receive distinct colours. Typical examples of isochromatic
and heterochromatic 4-poles are depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.

The adjectives “isochromatic” and “heterochromatic” can be similarly applied to
graphs: a subgraph of a cubic graph will be called isochromatic if attaching a dangling
edge to every 2-valent vertex produces an isochromatic 4-pole; a heterochromatic subgraph
is deﬁned similarly.

3 The 31 snarks

Let S36 denote the set of all cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks with at most 36 vertices;
as mentioned in [8], the set S36 consists of 432 105 682 nonisomorphic graphs. For any
two snarks G1 and G2 from S36 let us apply the following operation:

• From each Gi form a 4-pole Mi by either removing two adjacent vertices or two

nonadjacent edges and by retaining the dangling edges.

• Construct a cubic graph G by identifying the semiedges of M1 with those of M2

after possibly applying a permutation to the semiedges of M1 or M2.

The resulting graph G will be called a 4-join of G1 and G2. Deﬁne M to be the set all
pairwise nonisomorphic cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks of order 44 with oddness at
least 4 that can be expressed as a 4-join of two not necessarily distinct graphs from S36.
We have implemented a program which applies a 4-join in all possible ways to any
two input graphs; see [8] for more details concerning the program. We have applied this
program in all possible ways to every pair of graphs from S36 that lead to a graph on
44 vertices, and then tested which of the constructed graphs have oddness at least 4.
This computation took approximately 2 CPU years on a cluster consisting of Intel Xeon
E5-2660 CPU’s at 2.60GHz and produced 31 snarks with oddness exactly 4.

Observation 1. The set M consists of exactly 31 snarks, each of them having oddness
exactly 4 and girth 5.

In the remainder of this section we describe the 31 snarks in detail and provide a
computer-free proof that each of them has oddness at least 4. Their adjacency lists,
displayed in the order as they were generated, can be found in Appendix. Graph number
28 is illustrated in Figure 1, two more of the 31 graphs are depicted in Figure 1 and
Figure 4 in our previous paper [8] which represent graphs number 15 and 17, respectively.

Building blocks

The basic building blocks of all snarks constituting the set M are ﬁve multipoles I, H1,
H2, T, and N, described below, all of them arising from the Petersen graph by removing
vertices or severing edges. Every individual member of M may have a small number of
additional vertices not belonging to any of these subgraphs.

Figure 2: Building block I

1. Let I denote the (2, 2)-pole arising from the Petersen graph by removing two adjacent
vertices and grouping the semiedges formerly incident with the same vertex to the
same connector; it is shown in Figure 2. Since every 3-edge-colouring of I assigns
the edges in the same connector the same colour, I is an is an isochromatic 4-pole.
It is the only isochromatic 4-pole on eight vertices and at the same time the smallest
connected isochromatic 4-pole. In the symbolic representation of I we represent the
edges in one of the connectors by bold lines, see Figure 6. This clearly determines
the other connector as well. Due to the symmetry of the Petersen graph, the two
connectors of I are interchangeable.

We emphasise that the connectors of I, as well as those of the other four building
blocks H1, H2, T, and N, are unordered. Diﬀerent orderings are needed for the
construction of the members of M, a fact which partially explains a relatively large
size of this set.

Figure 3: Building blocks H1 and H2

2. Let H denote a (2, 2)-pole formed from the Petersen graph by severing two inde-
pendent edges and grouping the semiedges arising from the same edge to the same
connector. Every 3-edge-colouring of H assigns diﬀerent colours to the dangling
edges within the same connector, so H is a heterochromatic 4-pole. There are two
ways how to select a pair of independent edges in the Petersen graph – either at

7

distance 1 or at distance 2. Accordingly, there exist two nonisomorphic heterochro-
matic 4-poles on ten vertices, denoted by H1 and H2, respectively. Observe that
there exists no bridgeless heterochromatic 4-pole with fewer vertices. The two het-

erochromatic 4-poles on ten vertices are displayed in Figure 3.
representation of H we distinguish the two connectors of H again by using bold
lines for one of the connectors, see Figure 6. Again, the connectors of both H1 and
H2 are interchangeable.

Figure 4: Building block T

3. Let T denote the (2, 3)-pole obtained from the Petersen graph by removing an
arbitrary vertex v and severing an edge e not incident with v; the semiedges formerly
incident with v are put to one connector and those arising by severing e are put
to the other connector. The resulting (2, 3)-pole is shown in Figure 4. Given an
arbitrary 3-edge-colouring of T, the edges of the 2-connector receive two distinct
colours x and y, while the edges of the 3-connector receive the colours x + y, z, z,
where z is any colour from {1, 2, 3}. In the symbolic representation of T the edges
of the 2-connector are drawn bold, see Figure 6.

Figure 5: Building block N

4. Let N denote the (2, 2, 1)-pole arising from the Petersen graph by removing a path of
length 2. The two 2-connectors consist of the edges formerly incident with the same
end-vertex of the path, the 1-connector gets the remaining edge. The resulting
(2, 2, 1)-pole is shown in Figure 5. The important property of N consists in the
fact that every 3-edge-colouring of N assigns the edges of one of the 2-connectors
two distinct colours x and y while the edges of the other 2-connector receive the

8

same colour z ∈ {1, 2, 3}; the ﬁfth edge of N is coloured x + y. In the symbolic
representation of N the edges of one 2-connector are drawn bold and the 1-connector
edge is drawn dashed, see Figure 6. As with I and H before, the two 2-connectors
of N are interchangeable.

Six classes

We divide the 31 snarks of M into six classes depending on the number of disjoint copies
of I, H, T, and N, and on the number of additional vertices in the graph. For example,
by 2H + 2I + N + 1 we denote the set of all snarks from M that consist of two copies
of H, which need not be isomorphic, two copies of I, one copy of N, and one additional
vertex. We do not distinguish between the two varieties H1 and H2 of H because both
of them play the same structural role within the snark in question and their contribution
to increasing the oddness is the same. The six classes of M are

2H + 3I, 2H + 2I + N + 1, H + 4I + 2, H + 3I + T + 1, 5I + 4, and 4I + T + 3.

In the rest of this section we describe each of the classes in detail and prove that every
member G ∈ M has ω(G) (cid:62) 4. In our discussion we will be employing certain standard
combinations of the multipoles I, H, and T deﬁned by means of junctions. The order of
semiedges in connectors is in all cases irrelevant. We deﬁne the (2, 2)-poles Z1 = I ◦ H
and Z2 = I ◦ H ◦ I, the (2, 3)-pole Z4 = I ◦ T, where the junction involves the 2-connector
of T, and the (2, 2, 1)-pole Z3 deﬁned as follows: in the (2, 2)-pole I ◦ I subdivide one of
the edges between the two copies of I and subsequently attach a dangling edge to the new
vertex of degree 2; the connectors of Z3 are deﬁned in the obvious way. The multipoles
Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4 are illustrated in Figure 7.

Lemma 3. The following statements hold true:

ρ(Z1) = ρ(Z3) = ρ(Z4) = 1 and ρ(Z2) = 2.

Proof. Observe that Z1 is uncolourable because it is a junction of an isochromatic (2, 2)-
pole I with a heterochromatic (2, 2)-pole H. Hence, ρ(Z1) (cid:62) 1. Similarly, every colouring
of T assigns its 2-connector two distinct colours while I is isochromatic, so Z4 = I ◦ T is
uncolourable too, and therefore ρ(Z4) (cid:62) 1 again. If the (2, 2, 1)-pole Z3 was colourable,
then every 3-edge-colouring of Z3 would assign the edges adjacent to the dangling edge of

the 1-connector two distinct colours. At most one of these colours would match the colour
of the edge connecting the two copies of I in Z3. Therefore, the isochromatic property
of at least one copy of I in Z3 would always be violated. Hence, Z3 is uncolourable, and
therefore ρ(Z3) (cid:62) 1.

Finally we prove that ρ(Z2) (cid:62) 2. Since Z1 is contained in Z2 and ρ(Z1) (cid:62) 1, we
infer that ρ(Z2) (cid:62) 1 as well. In particular, the graph K obtained from Z2 by identifying
the semiedges within each connector is a snark. To prove that ρ(Z2) (cid:62) 2 suppose to the
contrary that ρ(Z2) = 1, and let v be a vertex such that Z2 − v is 3-edge-colourable.
Clearly, v cannot belong to a copy of I for otherwise Z2 − v would still contain a copy of
Z1 and therefore would be uncolourable. Thus v must belong to the copy of H, and hence
every 3-edge-colouring of Z2 − v must assign the same colour to both semiedges in any
of the connectors. Now we can match the semiedges of each connector, thereby obtaining
a 3-edge-colouring of K − v. Since K is a snark, such a colouring does not exist. This
contradiction proves that ρ(Z2) (cid:62) 2.

To establish the required equalities for each particular multipole one has to display
the corresponding colourings. Finding such colourings is straightforward, and therefore is
left to the reader.

In our analysis of the 31 snarks we will often need to distinguish between diﬀerent
copies of the same basic building block B ∈ {I, H, T, N}. For this purpose we will be
using upper indices, for example B1, B2, etc.

Class 1: 2H + 3I (7 graphs)

This class splits into two subclasses, Class 1a and Class 1b, depending on how the building
blocks are connected between each other. Both subclasses are illustrated in Figure 8. Each
graph G from Class 1 contains a copy of Z1 and a copy of Z2. Since the copies of Z1 and
Z2 are disjoint, Lemma 3 implies that ρ(G) (cid:62) 3 and hence ω(G) (cid:62) 4.

Class 1a consists of graphs 15, 17, and 18, while Class 1b contains graphs 1, 4, 21,

and 24.

Class 2: 2H + 2I + N + 1 (4 graphs)

The structure of graphs from Class 2 is illustrated in Figure 9. It can be seen that every
graph G from Class 2 contains two disjoint copies of Z1, therefore ρ(G) (cid:62) 2. Note each of
the induced subgraphs [H1 ∪N∪H2], [H1 ∪I1], [H2 ∪I2], and [I1 ∪I2 ∪{v}] is uncolourable,
the last of them being isomorphic to Z3. Thus if there exist two vertices u and w in G such
that G − {u, w} is colourable, then either one of them lies in H1 and the other lies in I2,
or one of them lies in H2 and the other lies in I1. In all other cases one of the mentioned
uncolourable subgraphs will remain intact. Without loss of generality we may assume
that u belongs to H1 and w belongs I2. Since I1 is isochromatic, the edges between I1 and
H1 have the same colour. Because H2 is heterochromatic, the colours the edges between
H2 and N are diﬀerent. The inverting property of N ensures that the edges between N
and H1 also have the same colour.
If we now identify the dangling edges within each
connector of H1, we obtain a colouring of the Petersen graph with one vertex removed.
This contradiction proves that that ρ(G) > 2, which means that ω(G) (cid:62) 4, as required.

Class 2 contains graphs 10, 11, 19, and 27.

which are disjoint, therefore ρ(G) (cid:62) 3 and ω(G) (cid:62) 4. Class 3c is somewhat diﬀerent and
requires a separate argument. Consider an arbitrary graph G graph from Class 3c. Since
G contains a copy of Z1, we have ρ(G) (cid:62) 2. Note that each of the subgraphs [H ∪ I1],
[I2 ∪ I3 ∪ {x}], and [I3 ∪ I4 ∪ {y}] has resistance 1. Thus if there exist two vertices u and
w in G such that G − {u, w} is 3-edge-colourable, then one of them, say u, lies in [H ∪ I1]
and the other belongs to I3. Since I2 and I4 remain intact in G − {u, w}, the isochromatic
property of I implies that the edge e connecting I2 to H has the same colour as the edge
f connecting I4 to H. Since H is heterochromatic, we conclude that u lies in H. As a
consequence, I1 remains intact in G − {u, w} too, which means that the two edges e(cid:48) and
f (cid:48) joining H to I1 are equally coloured as well. But then the induced colouring of H yields
a 3-edge-colouring of the Petersen graph with a single vertex removed. This contradiction
proves that ρ(G) > 2 and ω(G) (cid:62) 4.

Class 3a contains graphs 5 and 6, Class 3b contains graphs 7 and 23, and Class 3c

contains graphs 9 and 26.

Class 5: 5I + 4 (2 graphs)

Class 5 has two subclasses Class 5a and Class 5b; they are represented in Figure 12.
Observe that every member of Class 5 contains a 5-pole isomorphic to Z3, namely [I1 ∪
I2 ∪ {v1}], whose resistance is 1 by Lemma 3. Hence, every member of Class 5 is indeed
a snark.

Now, let us consider a graph G from Class 5a. To prove that ω(G) (cid:62) 4 suppose the
contrary. Then ω(G) = ρ(G) = 2, which means that there exist vertices u and w in
G such that G − {u, w} is colourable. Since each of the 5-poles [Ik ∪ Ik+1 ∪ {vk}], with
k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, is isomorphic to Z3, and ρ(Z3) = 1, none of them survives in G − {u, w}.
It follows that one of u and w lies in I2 and the other one lies in I4. Let ϕ be a 3-
edge-colouring of G − {u, w}. Without loss of generality we may assume that ϕ(f1) = 1,
ϕ(g1) = 2 and ϕ(h1) = 3. Since I1 remains intact in G − {u, w}, we have ϕ(e1) = 1.
Similarly, since I5 is intact, we have ϕ(h2) = ϕ(h1) = 3. Consider the colours of e2
and f2. Since I3 remains intact G − {u, w}, we deduce that ϕ(e2) = ϕ(g2) and hence
ϕ(e2) (cid:54)= ϕ(f2). Furthermore, {1, 2} = {ϕ(e1), ϕ(g1)} (cid:54)= {ϕ(e2), ϕ(f2)} because otherwise
the induced colouring of I2 would give rise to a 3-edge-colouring of the Petersen graph with
one vertex removed, which is impossible. Therefore {ϕ(e2), ϕ(f2)} = {1, 3} or {2, 3}, but
since ϕ(f2) (cid:54)= ϕ(h2) = 3 we conclude that ϕ(e2) = 3. However, the isochromatic property
of I3 forces ϕ(g2) = ϕ(e2) = 3, which is in conﬂict with the value ϕ(h2) = 3 because g2
and h2 are adjacent. Therefore ρ(G) (cid:62) 3 and ω(G) (cid:62) 4.

Next, let us consider a graph G from Class 5b. We wish to prove that ω(G) (cid:62) 4.
Suppose the contrary. Then ρ(G) = 2, which again means that there exist vertices u and
w in G such that G − {u, w} is 3-edge-colourable. In this case it is easy to see that one
of the vertices belongs I2 and the other one belongs to I4 ∪ I5 ∪ {v4}. Suppose that the
vertex w lies in I5 ∪ {v4} so that I4 remains intact. Take an arbitrary 3-edge-colouring ϕ
of G − {u, w}, and let ϕ(f3) = x. Since I1 and I3 are also left intact in G − {u, w}, we
deduce that ϕ(e3) = x, ϕ(g2) = x, and ﬁnally ϕ(g1) = x. However, the edges g1 and e3
are adjacent, so this is impossible. Therefore w ∈ I4, which means that I5 is left intact. In
this situation we can derive a contradiction in a similar way as for Class 5a. This proves
that ω(G) (cid:62) 4 for every graph from Class 5b.

Both Class 5a and Class 5b consist of a single graph each – graphs 28 and 30, respec-

tively.

Class 6: 4I + T + 3 (2 graphs)

The structure of Class 6 is displayed in Figure 13. Let us ﬁrst observe that every member
G of Class 6 is uncolourable because it contains the subgraph [I1 ∪ T] isomorphic to
It follows that ρ(G) (cid:62) 2. To prove that
Z4, whose resistance equals 1 by Lemma 3.
ω(G) (cid:62) 4 suppose to the contrary that ω(G) = 2 = ρ(G). Since each of the subgraphs
[Ik ∪ Ik+1 ∪ {vk}], with k ∈ {2, 3}, is also uncolourable, there exist vertices u ∈ I3 and
w ∈ [I1 ∪ T] such that G − {u, w} is 3-edge-colourable. Let ϕ be one such colouring.
Without loss of generality we may assume that ϕ(e1) = 1, ϕ(e2) = 2, and ϕ(e3) = 3.
Since I2 and I4 are left intact, we have ϕ(f1) = 2 and ϕ(f2) = 3. Put together, the

edges of the 3-connector of T receive three distinct colours from the colouring ϕ. As
previously mentioned, every 3-edge-colouring of T forces a repeated colour in the 3-
connector. Therefore w must belong to T. It follows that I1 remains intact and therefore
ϕ(g1) = ϕ(g2). But then the induced colouring of T yields a 3-edge-colouring of the
Petersen graph with a single vertex removed. This contradiction proves that ω(G) (cid:62) 4.

Class 6 contains two nonisomorphic graphs – 29 and 31.

Properties of graphs in M

We have determined the values of several invariants for the 31 snarks in M.
In most
cases the computations were performed by a computer. The evaluated invariants can be
divided into two groups. The ﬁrst group is constituted by general invariants: namely,
the order of the automorphism group, genus (minimum genus of an orientable surface
upon which a given graph can be drawn without intersections), diameter, radius, and
circumference (the maximal circuit length in a graph). The values of these invariants for
individual members of M are summarised in Table 1. In particular, all members of M
have circumference 41, that is, n − 3 where n is the number of vertices. The values of the
remaining invariants vary over the set M. It is quite remarkable that the automorphism
group of every graph in M is a 2-group (or is trivial).

The second group of invariants comprises those which are of particular interest for
snarks: perfect matching index π, resistance ρ, weak oddness ω(cid:48), and two invariants
introduced in [15, 26, 27] and denoted by µ3 and γ2; see also [5] for a recent survey. The
perfect matching index of a bridgeless cubic graph G, denoted by π(G) (also known as
excessive index and denoted by χ(cid:48)
e), is the smallest number of perfect matchings that
cover all the edges of G [2, 7]. The weak oddness of a cubic graph G, denoted by ω(cid:48)(G), is
the smallest number of components of odd order in an even factor of G; by an even factor
we mean a spanning subgraph with all degrees even. Given a bridgeless cubic graph G,
we deﬁne γ2(G) to be the smallest number of common edges that two perfect matchings
of G can have, and let µ3(G) be the smallest number of edges of G that are left uncovered
by the union of any three perfect matchings of G.

Table 1: Basic invariant values for the 31 snarks of M.

The perfect matching index π(G) of G is bounded below by 3 and equals 3 if and
It is believed, by a conjecture of Berge (see [23]), that
only if G is 3-edge-colourable.
π(G) (cid:54) 5 for every bridgeless cubic graph G. This conjecture, if true, thus divides all
snarks into two subclasses, those with perfect matching index equal to 4, and those with
perfect matching index 5. We have determined that π(G) = 4 for every G ∈ M.

The remaining invariants, along with oddness, can be regarded as measures of un-

16

colourability as they take value 0 on 3-edge-colourable graphs, and positive values other-
wise. Their comparison with oddness and resistance may therefore be very instructive.

First of all, using a computer we have determined that ρ(G) = 3 for all snarks G ∈ M.
As regards weak oddness, it is easy to see that ω(cid:48)(G) is an even integer such that ρ(G) (cid:54)
ω(cid:48)(G) (cid:54) ω(G). Furthermore, if ω(G) = 4, then necessarily ω(cid:48)(G) = 4 as well, because
otherwise ω(cid:48)(G) = 2 would immediately yield ρ(G) = 2 whence ω(G) = 2. In particular,
for all snarks G ∈ M we have ω(cid:48)(G) = ω(G) = 4. It is known, however, that in general
both the diﬀerence ω(G) − ω(cid:48)(G) and ω(cid:48)(G) − ρ(G) can be arbitrarily large (see [1, 17]).
We ﬁnish this section by discussing the previously mentioned invariants γ2 and µ3.
In [27, Proposition 2.1] Steﬀen proved that ω(G) (cid:54) 2γ2(G) for every bridgeless cubic
graph G. Using a computer we have determined that γ2(G) = 2 for every G ∈ M, which
shows that every snark from M fulﬁls the upper bound on ω set by γ2 with equality.
Similarly, in [15, Corollary 2.4] Jin and Steﬀen proved that ω(G) (cid:54) 2µ3(G)/3 for every
bridgeless cubic graph. Using a computer we have determined that all snarks G ∈ M
have µ3(G) = 6, which means that they again reach the upper bound on ω in terms of
µ3 with equality. Snarks with the latter property have a very special structure of sets of
edges left uncovered by three perfect matchings and therefore deserve special attention.
The values of perfect matching index, resistance, weak oddness, γ2, and µ3 for the

snarks of M are summarised in Table 2.

Inﬁnite families

Each of the six classes described above gives rise to an inﬁnite family of snarks with
oddness at least 4 and cyclic connectivity 4. It is suﬃcient to replace the basic building
blocks I, H, T, and N obtained from the Petersen graph with similar structures created
from any cyclically 4-edge-connected snark. With a little additional care one can construct
inﬁnite families of snarks with increasing oddness.

4 Completeness of M

In this section we prove that the set M, constructed and analysed in Section 3, is the
complete set of pairwise nonisomorphic snarks with cyclic connectivity 4, oddness at least
4, and minimum order. Our point of departure is the following theorem proved in [8].

Theorem 4. The smallest number of vertices of a snark with cyclic connectivity 4 and
oddness at least 4 is 44. The girth of each such snark is at least 5.

17

This result is a consequence of the following stronger and more detailed result from [8]

which will be needed for the proof of the main result of this paper.

Theorem 5. Let G be a snark with oddness at least 4, cyclic connectivity 4, and minimum
number of vertices. Let S be a cycle-separating 4-edge-cut in G whose removal leaves
components G1 and G2. Then, up to permutation of the index set {1, 2}, exactly one of
the following occurs.

(i) Both G1 and G2 are uncolourable, in which case each of them can be extended to a

cyclically 4-edge-connected snark by adding two vertices.

(ii) G1 is uncolourable and G2 is heterochromatic, in which case G1 can be extended to
a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark by adding two vertices, and G2 can be extended
to a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark by adding two isolated edges.

(iii) G1 is uncolourable and G2 is isochromatic, in which case G1 can be extended to a
cyclically 4-edge-connected snark by adding two vertices, and G2 can be extended to a
cyclically 4-edge-connected snark by adding two vertices, except possibly ζ(G2) = 2.
In the latter case, G2 is a partial junction of two colour-open 4-poles, which may be
isochromatic or heterochromatic in any combination.

Here is our main result:

Theorem 6. The set M is the complete set of snarks with cyclic connectivity 4 and
oddness at least 4 on 44 vertices.

Let N be the set of all snarks with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness at least 4 on 44
vertices. To prove Theorem 6 it suﬃces to show that N ⊆ M. The general strategy of
the proof is to show that every snark G ∈ N is a 4-join of two cyclically 4-edge-connected
snarks of order at most 36. As soon as this is done, one can perform 4-joins in all possible
ways that give rise to a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark of order 44, identify those whose
oddness equals 4, and check whether all of them belong to M.

In order to apply this strategy we employ Theorem 5. It implies that we can split
each G ∈ N into two subgraphs G1 and G2 each of which can be extended to cyclically
a 4-edge-connected snark by adding at most two vertices. The diﬃcult part of the proof
arises when one of the subgraphs, namely G1, has 36 vertices and G2 is an isochromatic
4-pole on 8 vertices (see (iii) of Theorem 5). Adding two adjacent vertices to G1 is now
useless because the list of all cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks is known only up to 36
vertices [4, 8]. Instead, we show that it is possible to add two isolated edges to G1 in such
a way that a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark of order 36 is created. A detailed analysis
that precedes this step is the core of the proof of Theorem 6, which now follows.

Proof. Let G be a snark with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness at least 4 on 44 vertices.
We wish to prove that G ∈ M. Suppose the contrary. In order to derive a contradiction
we ﬁrst establish four claims.

18

Claim 1. Every cycle-separating 4-edge-cut of G determines two components, one un-
colourable on 36 and one isochromatic on 8 vertices. Both components are 2-edge-connected.

Proof of Claim 1. Let S be an arbitrary cycle-separating 4-edge-cut in G and let G1
and G2 be the components of G − S. Since S is a minimum cycle-separating edge-cut,
both G1 and G2 are easily seen to be 2-edge-connected. ¿From Theorem 5 we deduce
that one of the components, say G1, is uncolourable. If G2 was either uncolourable or
heterochromatic, then it would have at least 10 vertices and hence G1 has at most 34
vertices. Using Theorem 5 again we could conclude that both G1 and G2 can be extended
to snarks of order at most 36, so G would be a 4-join of two snarks from S36 and therefore
a member of M. This contradiction shows that G2 is isochromatic.

Now we prove that the isochromatic component produced by an arbitrary cycle-sepa-
rating 4-edge-cut has only eight vertices. Suppose to the contrary that there exists a cycle
separating edge-cut R in G such that the isochromatic component, denoted by J, has at
least ten vertices. Choose R to minimise the number of vertices of J. Clearly, the other
component K of G − R has at most 34 vertices and, by the ﬁrst part of the proof, it is
uncolourable. It follows that K also has at least ten vertices, so J has at most 34 vertices
too. Theorem 5 further implies that K can be extended to a cyclically 4-edge-connected
snark ˜K by adding two vertices. If ζ(J) (cid:62) 3, the same theorem implies that J can also
be extended to a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark ˜J by adding two vertices. Since both
˜J and ˜K have order at most 36, G belongs to M – a contradiction. Therefore J has
a 2-edge-cut. By Theorem 5 (iii), J is a partial junction of two colour-open 4-poles J1
and J2. Since both δG(J1) and δG(J2) are cycle-separating 4-edge-cuts, both J1 and J2
must be isochromatic. If any of them had more than eight vertices, then the corresponding
edge-cut would contradict the choice of R. Therefore J is a partial junction of two copies
of the isochromatic 4-pole I on eight vertices, so J has 16 vertices and K has 28 vertices.
It follows that G can be expressed in the form (P (cid:12) P ) ⊗ H where P is the Petersen
graph, H is a snark on 30 vertices, and L1 (cid:12) L2 denotes a 4-join of cubic graphs L1 and
L2 which employs 4-poles resulting from the removal of two adjacent vertices from both
L1 and L2, while Q1 ⊗ Q2 denotes a 4-join of cubic graphs Q1 and Q2 which employs a
4-pole obtained from Q1 by removing two nonadjacent edges and a 4-pole obtained from
Q2 by removing two adjacent vertices. Using a computer we have constructed all graphs
G arising in this way and veriﬁed that each of them either belongs to M or has oddness
at most 2. This contradiction establishes Claim 1.

Claim 2. Every 4-edge-cut in G separates a subgraph with at most eight vertices from
the rest of G.

Proof of Claim 2. Let Q be a 4-edge-cut in G. If one of the components of G − Q is
acyclic, then, by Lemma 1, this component has two vertices.
If Q is cycle-separating,
then the conclusion follows from Claim 1. Claim 2 is proved.

Fix a cycle-separating 4-edge-cut S in G; we will refer to S as the principal 4-edge-cut
of G. As before, let G1 and G2 be the components of G − S where G1 is uncolourable.
By Claim 1, the other component G2 is isochromatic on eight vertices. Let A be the set
of end-vertices of S in G1. Since S is independent, we have |A| = 4.

19

The remainder of the proof is devoted to proving the following fact:

The component G1 can be extended to a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark by adding
two edges between the vertices of A.

As a consequence, G will be a 4-join of two graphs from S36, and therefore a member of
M. This will provide a ﬁnal contradiction.

Claim 3.G1 is cyclically 3-edge-connected and has a cycle-separating 3-edge-cut.
Proof of Claim 3. If ζ(G1) (cid:62) 4, then adding to G1 two edges joining the vertices of A
in an arbitrary manner would produce a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark of order 36.
Consequently, G would belong to M. Therefore ζ(G1) (cid:54) 3. To prove that ζ(G1) (cid:62) 3
suppose to the contrary that G1 has a cycle-separating 2-edge-cut U , and let G11 and G12
be the two components of G1 − U . Since G is cyclically 4-edge-connected, two edges of S
join G2 to G11 and other two edges of S join G2 to G12. Thus δG(G11) is a cycle-separating
4-edge-cut which separates G11 from G12 ∪ G2. Since G12 ∪ G2 contains more then eight
vertices, Claim 1 implies that G11 is an isochromatic dipole on eight vertices. Likewise,
G12 is an isochromatic dipole on eight vertices. Put together, G has altogether 24 vertices,
which is again a contradiction. Therefore ζ(G1) = 3. Finally, G1 is homeomorphic to a
certain cubic graph ¯G1 with ζ( ¯G1) = ζ(G1) on 32 vertices, so G1 is not a subdivision of the
complete graph K4 and therefore contains a cycle-separating 3-edge-cut. This establishes
Claim 3.

Before we can proceed we need two deﬁnitions. First, a cycle-separating 3-edge-cut Q
in G1 will be called balanced if each component of G1 − Q is incident with exactly two
edges of the principal 4-edge-cut S. Otherwise, Q will be called unbalanced. Second, let
R and T be two cycle-separating 3-edge-cuts in G1. Let X1 and X2 be the components
of G1 − R and let Y1 and Y2 be the components of G1 − T . The edge-cuts R and T in G1
will be called comparable if Xi ⊆ Yj or Yj ⊆ Xi for some i, j ∈ {1, 2}.

Claim 4. G1 contains two incomparable balanced 3-edge-cuts.

Proof of Claim 4. Let us ﬁrst observe that if Q is an arbitrary unbalanced 3-edge-cut
in G1, then adding any two edges between the vertices of A in an arbitrary manner will
produce a cubic graph ˜G1 where Q has ceased to be an edge-cut. It follows that if every
cycle-separating 3-edge-cut in G1 is unbalanced, then ˜G1 is a cyclically 4-edge-connected
snark and G is a 4-join of ˜G1 with the Petersen graph. Since G1 has 36 vertices, G ∈ M
and we have arrived at a contradiction. Therefore G1 must contain a balanced 3-edge-cut.
If every pair of balanced 3-edge-cuts in G1 is comparable, we can arrange the balanced
3-edge-cuts in an increasing linear order, say Q1, . . . , Qm. Clearly, there is a component
H1 of G1 − Q1 and a component Hm of G1 − Qm such that both of them are disjoint from
all of Q1, . . . , Qm. It is easy to see that H1 contains two vertices of A while Hm contains
the other two, see Figure 14. Thus we can connect the two vertices of H1 ∩ A to those
of Hm ∩ A by two edges, producing a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark ˜G1. Again, G is
a 4-join of ˜G1 with the Petersen graph, so G belongs to M contrary to the assumption.
Therefore G1 contains two incomparable balanced 3-edge-cuts. This proves Claim 4.

...In the rest the proof we explore the structure of G1 arising from a pair of incomparable
balanced 3-edge-cuts. Let R and T be any two incomparable balanced 3-edge-cuts in G1.
Clearly, G1 − R has two components, say X1 and X2, and G1 − T has two components,
say Y1 and Y2. The deﬁnition of comparable edge-cuts readily implies that each of the
subgraphs Xi ∩ Yj is non-empty. Let a be the number of edges between X1 ∩ Y1 and
X1 ∩ Y2, b the number of edges between X1 ∩ Y1 and X2 ∩ Y2, c the number of edges
between X1 ∩ Y1 and X2 ∩ Y1, d the number of edges between X1 ∩ Y2 and X2 ∩ Y1, e the
number of edges between X2 ∩ Y1 to X2 ∩ Y2, and ﬁnally f the number of edges between
X1 ∩ Y2 and X2 ∩ Y2; see Figure 15.

Since X1, X2, Y1 and Y2 are all connected, we have

a (cid:62) 1,

e (cid:62) 1,

c (cid:62) 1,

f (cid:62) 1.

|R| = |δG1(X1)| = c + f + b + d = 3

Next,

and

|T | = |δG1(Y1)| = a + e + b + d = 3.

By combining (1) and (2) we can further conclude that

b + d (cid:54) 1.

(4)

We now consider two cases according to whether there exists a set Xi ∩ Yj such that

Xi ∩ Xj ∩ A = ∅ or not.

Case 1: There exists a subgraph Xi ∩ Yj, with i, j ∈ {1, 2}, such that Xi ∩ Xj ∩ A = ∅. In
view of symmetry we can clearly assume that X1 ∩ X2 ∩ A = ∅. In this situation X1 ∩ Y2
is incident with two edges of S, because R is balanced, and X2 ∩ Y1 is incident with the
other two edges of S, because T is balanced. It follows that |X2 ∩ Y2 ∩ A| = 0 as well.

With (1) in mind, we ﬁrst prove that a = e = c = f = 1. Suppose to the contrary
that one of these values is strictly greater than 1. In view of symmetry we can assume
that a > 1. Now (1) and (3) forces a = 2, e = 1, b = 0, and d = 0, which together
with (2) implies that either c = 2 and f = 1, or c = 1 and f = 2. In the former case,
|δG(X2 ∩ Y2)| = b + e + f = 2 contrary to the fact that G is 3-edge-connected, while in the
latter case X2 ∩ Y1 is separated from the rest of G1 by c + d + e = 2 edges, contradicting
Claim 3. Therefore a = e = c = f = 1.

Now, (2) and (4) imply that b + d = 1. However, b (cid:62) 1 for otherwise |δG(X1 ∩ Y1)| =
a + b + c = 2, contrary to the fact that G is 3-edge-connected. So b = 1 and d = 0. It
follows that |δG(X1 ∩ Y1)| = a + b + c = 3 and |δG(X2 ∩ Y2)| = b + e + f = 3. Since G
is cyclically 4-edge-connected, both X1 ∩ Y1 and X2 ∩ Y2 are acyclic, and therefore, by
Lemma 1, both consist of a single vertex. Further, |δG(X1 ∩ Y2)| = 2 + a + d + f = 4 and
|δG(X2 ∩ Y1)| = 2 + c + d + e = 4, so |X1 ∩ Y2| (cid:62) 2 and |X2 ∩ Y1| (cid:62) 2. By Claim 2, one of

22

the components determined by δG(X1 ∩ Y2) has at most eight vertices. Since the number
of vertices of G lying outside X1 ∩ Y2 is

|G2| + |X2 ∩ Y1| + |X1 ∩ Y1| + |X2 ∩ Y2| (cid:62) 8 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12,

we conclude that |X1 ∩ Y2| (cid:54) 8. Similarly, |X2 ∩ Y1| (cid:54) 8. Summing up,

|G1| (cid:54) |X1 ∩ Y1| + |X2 ∩ Y2| + |X1 ∩ Y2| + |X2 ∩ Y1| (cid:54) 1 + 1 + 8 + 8 < 36,

which contradicts Claim 1. This establishes Case 1.

Case 2: Xi ∩ Xj ∩ A (cid:54)= ∅ for each i, j ∈ {1, 2}. Clearly, this is only possible when each
of the subgraphs Xi ∩ Yi is incident with exactly one edge of the principal 4-edge-cut S.
We may assume that A = {a1, a2, a3, a4} where a1 lies in X1 ∩ Y1, a2 lies in X1 ∩ Y2, a3
lies in X2 ∩ Y1, and a4 lies in X2 ∩ Y2.

For each Xi ∩ Yi we count the number of edges of R ∪ T this subgraph is incident with.

According to (1) we obtain

a + b + c (cid:62) 2,

a + d + f (cid:62) 2,

c + d + e (cid:62) 2,

b + e + f (cid:62) 2.

(5)

If all the inequalities in (5) are strict, then summing the ﬁrst two of them yields

6 (cid:54) 2a + (b + c + d + f ) = 2a + |R| = 2a + 3,

whence a (cid:62) 2. Similarly, summing the latter two inequalities implies that e (cid:62) 2. But
then

|T | = a + b + d + e (cid:62) 4,

which is a contradiction.

Therefore at least one of the inequalities in (5) holds with equality. Due to symmetry
we may assume that a + b + c = 2. From (1) we now infer that a = c = 1 and b = 0. If
we plug these values into (2) and (3), we get d + f = 2 = d + e. Since d (cid:54) 1 on account
of (4), we conclude that either d = e = f = 1, or d = 0 and e = f = 2.

First assume that d = e = f = 1. In this case |δG(X1 ∩ Y1)| = 3 = |δG(X2 ∩ Y2)|, so
|X1 ∩ Y1| = 1 = |X2 ∩ Y2| by Lemma 1. Furthermore, |δG(X1 ∩ Y2)| = |δG(X2 ∩ Y1)| = 4.
By Claim 2, one of the components determined by δG(X1 ∩ Y2) has at most eight vertices.
As in Case 1, the number of vertices of G outside X1 ∩ Y2 is at least 12, so |X1 ∩ Y2| (cid:54) 8.
Similarly |X2 ∩Y1| (cid:54) 8, and therefore |G1| (cid:54) 1+1+8+8 < 36, which contradicts Claim 1.
Next assume that d = 0 and e = f = 2. Recall that a = c = 1 and b = 0. It follows
that |δG(X1 ∩ Y1)| = 3 which means that X1 ∩ X1 consists of a single vertex a1. Further,
|δG(X1 ∩ Y2)| = 4 and |δG(X2 ∩ Y1)| = 4, so |X1 ∩ Y2| (cid:54) 8 and |X2 ∩ Y1| (cid:54) 8. Also,
|δG(X2 ∩ Y2)| = 5. In fact, Claim 1 implies that X1 ∩ Y2 and X2 ∩ Y1 are isochromatic 4-
poles on eight vertices, because R and T are cycle-separating edge-cuts and hence X1 ∩ Y2
and X2 ∩ Y1 must contain circuits.

We show that X2 ∩ Y2 is 2-edge-connected. If X2 ∩ Y2 was disconnected, it would have
a component B with |δG(B)| (cid:54) 2, contradicting the fact that G is 3-edge-connected. If

23

there was a bridge in X2 ∩ Y2, then the bridge would join a subgraph B1 with δG(B1) = 3
to a subgraph B2 with δG(B2) = 4. By Lemma 1 and Claim 2, |B1| = 1 while |B2| (cid:54) 8, so
|G1| (cid:54) 1 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 8 < 36, contrary to Claim 1. Therefore X2 ∩ Y2 is 2-edge-connected.
Let us now extend G1 to a cubic graph ˜G1 by adding the edges a1a4 and a2a3. Since
G1 is uncolourable, ˜G1 is a snark. We wish to show that ˜G1 is cyclically 4-edge-connected.
To this end, observe that a cycle-separating 3-edge-cut of G1 that separates either a1 from
a4 or a2 from a3 fails to be an edge-cut in ˜G1. Therefore every cycle-separating 3-edge-cut
that might survive from G1 to ˜G1 separates {a1, a4} from {a2, a3}. We prove that such a
cut does not exist, displaying four edge-disjoint {a1, a4}-{a2, a3}-paths in G1.

Let a1b2 and a1b3 be the edges that join a1 to a vertex b2 in X1 ∩ Y2 and to a vertex b3
in X2 ∩ Y1, respectively. Let c2d2 be an edge joining a vertex c2 in X1 ∩ Y2 to a vertex d2
in X2 ∩ Y2, and let c3d3 be an edge joining a vertex c3 in X2 ∩ Y1 to a vertex d3 in X2 ∩ Y2
(see Figure 16). Since X1 ∩ Y2, X2 ∩ Y1, and X2 ∩ Y2 are all 2-edge-connected, there exist

– edge-disjoint paths J2 and L2 in X1 ∩ Y2 from a2 to b2 and c2, respectively;

– edge-disjoint paths J3 and L3 in X2 ∩ Y1 from a3 to b3 and c3, respectively; and

– edge-disjoint paths M2 and M3 from a4 to d2 and d3, respectively.

It follows that a1b2J −1
are four edge-disjoint paths
joining {a1, a4} to {a2, a3} in G1. As a consequence, ˜G1 is a cyclically 4-edge-connected
snark of order 36, and therefore G ∈ M. This ﬁnal contradiction establishes the theorem.

5 Further computational results

In addition to determining the complete set M of snarks of oddness at least 4 with cyclic
connectivity 4 and minimum number of vertices, we have also generated a considerable
number of snarks of oddness at least 4 with orders ranging from 46 to 52. In order to
produce as many nonisomorphic snarks as possible we have applied the 4-join operation
in all possible ways to any pair of cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks with at most 36
vertices as long as the resulting graph had at most 52 vertices and computed its oddness.
To extend the set we have further applied I-extensions and I-reductions in all possible
ways to the snarks of oddness at least 4 constructed by 4-joins until no new snarks of
oddness at least 4 were found. An I-extension of a cubic graph subdivides two edges e
and f of G with a new vertex ve and vf , respectively, and adds a new edge between ve
and vf ; an I-reduction is the inverse of an I-extension. The combination of 4-joins, I-
extensions, and I-reductions produced a set 887 152 nonisomorphic snarks of orders from
46 to 52, all of oddness 4. None of the produced snarks had oddness greater than 4 or
cyclic connectivity greater than 4.

The counts of the number of snarks of oddness at least 4 which our method yielded
can be found in Table 3. While the set of 31 snarks of order 44 is complete by Theorem 4,
it is very unlikely that this is the case for any of the sets of snarks of oddness 4 of orders
between 46 and 52.

Table 3: Counts of the smallest snarks of oddness 4 and cyclic connectivity 4.

In [16, Theorem 12] it was shown that if we allow trivial snarks, the smallest one with
oddness greater than 2 has 28 vertices and oddness 4. There are exactly three such snarks,
one with cyclic connectivity 3 and two with cyclic connectivity 2, all three having girth 5
(see [9] and [16, Corrigendum]). Since small snarks with oddness 4 – irrespectively of their
connectivity – can be useful for a better understanding of oddness, we include Table 4
which lists the counts of all trivial snarks of oddness 4 with girth at least 4 of orders from
28 to 34. The graphs from Table 4 were generated by the ﬁrst author in [9]. Restricting to
girth at least 4 is reasonable because every snark with oddness 4 that contains a triangle
or a digon must arise from a smaller snark with the same oddness in a straightforward
manner [16, Lemma 1].

A glance at Table 3 reveals that no snarks of oddness 4 and girth 4 on 46 vertices have
been found. A similar phenomenon occurs for the trivial snarks in Table 4: there are no

snarks of oddness 4 and girth 4 of order 30. In contrast to orders 44 and 28, we do not
have any theoretical argument that would exclude the existence of such snarks.

The graphs from Table 3 can be downloaded from the House of Graphs [3] at http:
//hog.grinvin.org/Snarks and the snarks of oddness 4 on 44 and 46 vertices from
Table 3 can be inspected at the database of interesting graphs from the House of Graphs
by searching for the keywords “nontrivial snarks * oddness 4”.

In the remainder of this section, we discuss several invariants of the graphs from
Tables 3 and 4, again divided into two groups – uncolourability measures and general
invariants. All invariant values have been computed by two independent programs or by
programs which were already extensively tested in earlier research. For example, the two
independent programs that we have used to compute the oddness of the graphs can be
downloaded from [10]. In the Appendix we describe how some of the graphs from Table 3
which appear particularity interesting can be obtained.

5.1 Resistance and other measures of uncolourability

We begin our discussion with invariants which, in a certain sense, measure uncolourability
of cubic graphs. For all snarks from Tables 3 and 4 we have determined their resistance,
perfect matching index, and the invariants γ2 and µ3. All of them have been deﬁned
earlier in this paper and their values were discussed for the 31 snarks in M in Section 3.
We also know that all snarks from Tables 3 and 4 have weak oddness 4 because this is
true in general for all snarks of oddness 4. The remaining invariants have been computed
with the help of a computer.

We start with the resistance of the snarks that we have constructed.

Observation 2. All snarks from Table 3 and 4 have resistance 3, except for six snarks
on 52 vertices, which have resistance 4.

The ﬁrst example of a cyclically 4-edge-connected snark with resistance 4 on 52 ver-
tices was constructed by Lukot’ka et al. [16, Section 7]. The same snark is depicted and
discussed by Jin and Steﬀen in [15, Figure 3]. Two more examples of order 52 can be
easily obtained if we replace one or both copies of H1 contained in this snark with H2;
all three of them are included among the mentioned six snarks. Since we have no guaran-
tee that these are the smallest nontrivial snarks with resistance 4, we oﬀer the following
problem.

26

Problem 1. What is the smallest order of a snark with resistance 4? What is the smallest
order of a nontrivial snark with resistance 4?

A snark with oddness 4 and connectivity 2 on 40 vertices was constructed in [16,
Section 6]. We have veriﬁed that its resistance is 4, so the upper bound for the ﬁrst
question in Problem 1 is 40. On the other hand, Observation 2 implies that the lower
bound is 36.

All nontrivial snarks with resistance 3 known to us have weak oddness 4 (and hence

oddness 4 as well). It is therefore tempting to ask the following questions.

Problem 2. Does there exist a nontrivial snark with resistance 3 and weak oddness
greater than 4? Can the diﬀerence be arbitrarily large?

Allie [1] constructed nontrivial snarks demonstrating that the diﬀerence ω − ω(cid:48) can be
arbitrarily large. Unfortunately, all of them have resistance 3 and weak oddness 4 while
their oddness is arbitrarily large.

The remaining three uncolourability measures that we are going to examine are related
to the structure of perfect matchings in snarks: the perfect matching index π and the
invariants µ3 and γ2 (see Section 3). The results for perfect matching index are collected
in the following observation and Table 5.

Observation 3. All snarks of oddness 4 from Table 3 have perfect matching index π = 4,
except for one graph of order 52 which has π = 5.

Table 5: Counts of the value of perfect matching index for the snarks from Table 4.

While the previous observation seems to suggest that among snarks with oddness at
least 4 those with perfect matching index 5 (or more) are rare, Table 5 draws a diﬀerent
picture: only 46 among the 872 trivial snarks of oddness 4 of orders 28–34 listed in Table 4
have perfect matching index 4.

We proceed to the invariant µ3. Tables 6 and 7 show the counts of the value of µ3 of the
snarks of oddness 4 from Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Again, there is a striking diﬀerence
between the trivial and the nontrivial snarks. Most cyclically 4-edge-connected snarks in
Table 3 have µ3 = 6, which is the minimal possible value for snarks with ω = 4, according
to [15, Corollary 2.4]. By contrast, most trivial snarks from Table 4 have µ3 > 6.

Finally, we discuss the invariant γ2.

Table 8: Counts of the value of γ2 for the snarks from Table 4.

Table 8 shows the counts of the value of γ2 of the snarks of oddness 4 from Table 4.
Again, the picture for trivial snarks is quite diﬀerent. Most cyclically 4-edge-connected
snarks from Table 3 have γ2 = 2, which is the minimum possible value for snarks with
ω = 4, by [27, Proposition 2.1]. By contrast, for trivial snarks the distribution of values
γ2 = 2 and γ2 = 3 is more even.

5.2 Circumference

Every hamiltonian cubic graph is 3-edge-colourable, which means that the circumference
of every snark can be at most n − 1, where n denotes the number of vertices. The

28

circumference deﬁcit, denoted here by ξ, is the diﬀerence between order and circumference.
It is not diﬃcult to observe that the circumference deﬁcit of a cubic graph G is at least
its resistance ρ(G), if the circumference deﬁcit is even, and at least ρ(G) − 1, otherwise.
In this sense, circumference deﬁcit can also be considered as one of the measures of
uncolourability of cubic graphs.

The well known dominating cycle conjecture [6] implies that every cyclically 4-edge-
connected snark has circumference at least 4n/3, where n is the order of the graph. On
the other hand, in [18] M´aˇcajov´a and Maz´ak constructed a family of cyclically 4-edge-
connected snarks on 8m vertices with circumference 7m + 2. They also made a conjecture
that every cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic has circumference at least 7n/8.

Brinkmann et al. determined in [4] that nearly all nontrivial snarks up to 36 vertices
have circumference n − 1 and the remainder (about 0.002 %) has circumference n − 2. We
have determined the circumference of our snarks of oddness 4, and the result is as follows.

Observation 5. All snarks of oddness 4 from Table 3 have circumference deﬁcit 3, except
for nine graphs on 52 vertices which have circumference deﬁcit 4.

The nine graphs with circumference deﬁcit ξ = 4 from Observation 5 include the six

graphs of resistance 4 from Observation 2.

As can be seen from Table 9, the behaviour of circumference on trivial snarks is again

quite diﬀerent from that of the nontrivial ones.

5.3 Automorphism group

Tables 10 and 11 show statistics of the number of automorphisms of the snarks from
Tables 3 and 4, respectively. With the exception of two snarks on 50 vertices, the auto-
morphism group of each of these graphs has order a power of 2, three times a power of 2,
or nine times a power of 2, powers of 2 signiﬁcantly prevailing.

5.4 Genus

Tables 12 and 13 show the genus of the snarks of oddness 4 from Tables 3 and 4 and reveal
that among the constructed snarks of oddness 4 there are no snarks of genus smaller than
their resistance and no nontrivial snarks of genus smaller than their oddness. On the
other hand, it is known that there exist inﬁnitely many snarks of genus 1 (Vodopivec [28])

6 Final remarks

It is important to emphasise that Theorem 4, which is the main result of our previous
paper [8], does not yet determine the order of a smallest nontrivial snark with oddness at
least 4. The reason is that it does not exclude the existence of cyclically 5-edge-connected
snarks with oddness at least 4 on fewer than 44 vertices. However, the smallest currently
known cyclically 5-edge-connected snark with oddness at least 4 has 76 vertices (see [16,
Section 8]), which indicates that a cyclically 5-edge-connected snark with oddness at least
4 on fewer than 44 vertices either does not exist or will be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Thus the
following problem remains open.

Problem 5. Determine the smallest order of a nontrivial snark with oddness at least 4.

If we take into account the fact that the validity of the cycle double cover conjecture

is open for snarks of oddness 6 [11], the following problem appears to be interesting.

Problem 6. Determine the smallest order of a nontrivial snark with oddness at least 6.

The problem remains interesting even in the version where snarks are required only
to be 2-connected rather than nontrivial, since trivial snarks with large oddness can
serve as ingredients for constructions of nontrivial ones. The best current upper bound
for Problem 6 is 70 in the nontrivial version, see [16, Section 7] and 40 in the trivial
version [16, Section 6]. It follows from [9] that the current lower bound for the trivial
version is 36.

Appendix 1: Obtaining graphs from the Observations in Section 5

Exceptional graphs mentioned in Observations 2-5 in Section 5 can be obtained from the
database of interesting graphs in the House of Graphs [3] by searching keywords “snark
* resistance 4”, “snark * perfect matching index 5”, “snark * gamma”, and “snark *
circumference deﬁcit 4”, respectively.

Appendix 2: Adjacency lists of the 31 snarks in M

We present the adjacency lists of the 31 snarks in M. These graphs can be downloaded
at http://hog.grinvin.org/Snarks or can be inspected at the database of interesting
graphs from the House of Graphs [3] by searching for the keywords “nontrivial snarks *
oddness 4”. The graphs are listed in the order in which they were generated.
