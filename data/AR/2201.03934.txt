Abstract 

Two-dimensional  wedge-stabilized  oblique  detonations  in  stoichiometric  and  fuel-lean 
H2/O2/Ar mixtures with water mists are studied with Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The effects of 
water  droplet  mass  flow  rate  on  flow  and  chemical  structures  in  the  induction  zone,  as  well  as 
physical  /  chemical  roles  of  water  vapor,  are  investigated.  The  results  show  that  the  oblique 
detonation wave (ODW) can stand in a range of water mass flow rates for both stoichiometric and 
fuel-lean mixtures. With increased droplet mass flow rate,  the deflagration front in the induction 
zone is distorted and becomes zigzagged, but the transition mode from oblique shock wave (OSW) 
to ODW does not change. Moreover, the initiation and transition locations monotonically increase, 
and the OSW and ODW angles decrease, due to droplet evaporation and water vapor dilution in the 
induction region. For fuel-lean mixtures, the sensitivity of  characteristic locations to the droplet 
loading variations is mild, which signifies better intrinsic stability and resilience to the oncoming 
water  droplets.  The  chemical  explosiveness  of  the  gaseous  mixture  between  the  lead  shock  and 
reaction  front  is  studied  with  the  chemical  explosive  method  analysis.  The  smooth  transition  is 
caused  by  the  highly  enhanced  reactivity  of  the  gas  immediately  behind  the  curved  shock, 
intensified  by  the  compression  waves.  Nonetheless,  the  abrupt  transition  results  from  the 
intersection between the  beforehand generated  detonation wave  in the induction zone  and OSW. 
Besides, the degree to which the gas chemical reactivity in the induction zone for fuel-lean mixtures 
is reduced by evaporating droplets is generally lower than that for stoichiometric gas. Also, physical 
and chemical effects of water vapor from liquid droplets result in significant differences in ODW 
initiation and morphology. When  abrupt transition occurs, both  physical and chemical effects of 
water vapour influence transition location and ODW angle, but only physical one is important for 
smooth transition.

1. Introduction 

Oblique  detonation  engine  (ODE)  is  a  promising  propulsion  technology  for  air-breathing 

hypersonic  aircraft  operating  at  high  flight  Mach  number  [1 ,2  .  It  not  only  has  the  advantages  of 

scramjet [3,4 , but also enjoys high thermal cycle efficiency because of oblique detonation combustion 

[5 . Oblique detonation wave (ODW) is a fundamental combustion mode in ODE, and results from the 

coupling between an oblique shock and chemical reactions of supersonic combustible mixture flowing 

past a wedge [6 . Under some practical conditions, unsteadiness or non-uniformity of the supersonic 

flows may exist. For instance, variations of the flight speed or altitude of oblique detonation engine 

would change inflow conditions, inducing imperfect reactant mixing and compositional stratification. 

Besides, liquid fuel vapor concentration may not be uniform if the liquid fuel is not well atomized, 

resulting  in  differentiated  evaporation  rates.  How  an  ODW  is  initiated  and  stabilized  under  such 

realistic scenarios are still not well understood. 

Most of the previous studies about ODW initiation and stabilization are focused on idealized (e.g., 

premixed, uniform, or homogeneous) approaching combustible mixtures. For instance, Pratt et al. [7  

derive  analytical  solutions  between  oblique  shock/detonation  wave  angle  and  inflow  conditions 

through thermodynamic analysis. Li et al. [6  find that oblique detonation is composed of a nonreactive 

oblique shock, an induction zone followed by a reaction zone, and an oblique detonation. Figueira da 

Silva  et  al.  [8    reveal  various  regions  behind  the  oblique  shock  wave  (OSW)  depending  on  local 

chemical and gas dynamics properties. Verreault et al. [9  investigate the dynamics of transverse waves 

in oblique detonations and find that spatial oscillations from the ODW transition evolve into transverse 

waves propagating downstream. Moreover, two OSW-ODW transition modes are identified [10,11 : 

abrupt transition connected by a multi-wave point, and smooth transition featured by a curved shock. 

Recent studies by Teng et al. [12  observe more complex wave systems, and different wave structures 

in the transition zone are also discussed. 

How  the  induction  zone  and  oblique  detonation  wave  evolve  subject  to  non-uniformity  or 

perturbation of thermochemical state in the combustible mixture is also studied. For instance, Li et al. 

[6  study how the induction zone changes when a density perturbation is introduced, and the oblique 

2 

detonation structure is shown to have good resilience. Similar resilience is also studied by Fusina et al. 

[13 , who introduce some small pockets without fuel in the inflow mixtures. Besides, Iwata et al. [14  

simulate  oblique  detonations  with  inhomogeneous  mixtures,  and  their  results  indicate  that  the 

deflagration fronts can be “V” or “V+Y”-shaped. The distorted deflagration front is also observed by 

Guo et al. [15  when non-uniform equivalence ratios are considered. Fang et al. [16  find that ODW 

can remain stable, even at high equivalence ratio gradient. Recently, Ren et al. [17  investigate the 

response of ODW to a (time-evolving) sinusoidal variation of inflow equivalence ratio. The results 

show that for low-to-medium fluctuations the increasing amplitude only affects the ODW initiation 

and  leads  to  ODW  surface  instability,  and  the  ODW  structures  become  more  robust  in  fuel-lean 

situations. 

It  is  well  known  that  liquid  fuels  have  numerous  advantages,  e.g.,  high  energy  density,  easy 

storage, and possibility to be used as engine coolant. Therefore, they have good potential for detonation 

engine applications. Indeed, feasibility to utilize liquid fuels for laboratory scale detonation propulsion 

test rigs has been confirmed through deliberately designed combustor and fuel injector. For instance, 

Fan  et  al.  [18    successfully  conduct  two-phase  pulse  detonation  engine  experiments  with  liquid 

C8H16/air mixture. Besides, Kindracki et al. [19  investigate the influence of liquid kerosene properties 

on  initiation  and  propagation  of  rotating  detonations.  Nonetheless,  use  of  liquid  fuels  may  lead  to 

highly inhomogeneous mixtures and investigations on ODW with liquid fuels are rather limited in the 

open  literature.  Recently,  Ren  et  al.  [20 ,21    study  the  effects  of  evaporating  droplets  and  spray 

equivalence ratios on ODW initiation in two-phase kerosene-air mixtures. The results show that the 

variations of initiation length and transition pressure are dominated by evaporative cooling and heat 

release,  respectively.  However,  they  have  not  studied  how  the  OSW-ODW  transition  mode  and 

induction zone structure change when the gas-liquid two-phase approaching flows are considered. 

Typically,  under  supersonic  flow  conditions,  liquid  fuels  need  to  be  well sprayed  for  efficient 

evaporation and vapor combustion due to short residence time in the chamber. This leads to a large 

number of dispersed fine droplets in the incoming flows. These droplets would have strong and multi-

faceted coupling with the continuous gas phase. For example, droplet evaporation leads to latent heat 

3 

absorption  and  vapor  addition,  thereby  modulating  the  thermochemical  state  of  the  mixture  and 

combustion  morphology  [22 . The  objective  of  this  work  is  to  study  how  the  evaporating  droplets 

affect the initiation mode and induction zone structure of the oblique detonation induced by a wedge. 

Eulerian-Lagrangian method is used to simulate the multi-species compressible gas-liquid two-phase 

flows. Hydrogen will be considered as the fuel, and the disperse phase is ultrafine water droplets. A 

parametric analysis is performed to reveal the effects of water droplet mass flow rate on detonation 

initiation and induction zone structure in both abrupt and smooth transitions from shock to detonation. 

2. Mathematical model and computational method 

The Eulerian-Lagrangian method is employed to simulate wedge-induced hydrogen detonations 

in water fog environment. The Eulerian gas and  Lagrangian liquid droplet governing equations are 

solved by a compressible two-phase reacting flow solver, RYrhoCentralFoam [23,24 . It is developed 

from a fully compressible flow solver rhoCentralFoam in OpenFOAM 6.0 [25 . The details about the 

equations and models are presented below. 

2.1 Gas phase 

The equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species mass fraction are solved for multi-species, 

two-phase, reactive, compressible flows. They respectively read

In  above  equations,  𝑡  is  time  and  ∇ ∙ (∙)   is  the  divergence  operator.  ρ  is  the  gas  density,  u  is  the 

velocity vector, and  𝑝  is the pressure updated from the equation of state, i.e.,  𝑝 = 𝜌𝑅𝑇.  𝑇  is the gas

fraction  of  m-th  species  and  𝑀   is  the  total  species  number.  𝐸 ≡ 𝑒𝑠 + |𝐮|2 2⁄    is  the  total  non-

chemical  energy,  in  which  𝑒𝑠 = ℎ𝑠 − 𝑝 𝜌⁄    is  the  sensible  internal  energy  and  ℎ𝑠   is  the  sensible 

enthalpy [26 . 

The viscous stress tensor  𝐓  in Eq. (2) is modelled by  𝐓 = −2𝜇[𝐃 − tr(𝐃)𝐈/3]. μ is the dynamic 

viscosity,  following  the  Sutherland’s  law.  𝐃 ≡ [∇𝐮 + (∇𝐮)𝑇]/2  is  the  deformation  gradient  tensor 

and I is the unit tensor. In addition, j in Eq. (3) is the diffusive heat flux, modelled with Fourier’s law, 

i.e.,  𝐣 = −𝑘∇𝑇. Thermal conductivity k is calculated using the Eucken approximation [27 , i.e.,  𝑘 =

𝜇𝐶𝑣(1.32 + 1.37𝑅/𝐶𝑣).  𝐶𝑣  is the heat capacity at constant volume and derived from  𝐶𝑣 = 𝐶𝑝 − 𝑅. 

Here  𝐶𝑝 = ∑

In Eq. (4),  𝐬𝐦 = −𝐷𝑚∇(𝜌𝑌𝑚)  is the species mass flux.  𝐷𝑚  is calculated through  𝐷𝑚 = 𝑘/𝜌𝐶𝑝 

with a unity Lewis number assumption. Moreover,  𝜔̇ 𝑚  is the production or consumption rate of m-th 

species by all N reactions, and can be calculated from the reaction rate of each reaction, i.e.,  𝜔̇ 𝑚 =

2.2 Liquid phase 

The Lagrangian method is used to model the dispersed liquid phase, which is composed of a large 

number of spherical droplets [29 . Droplet collisions are neglected because we only study dilute water 

sprays with initial volume fraction less than 0.1% [30 . Droplet breakup is not considered in this work. 

Besides, since the ratio of gas density to the water droplet material density is well below one, Basset 

force, history force and gravity force are neglected [30 . The temperature inside the droplet is assumed 

to be uniform, considering the small Biot number of water droplets. Therefore, the governing equations 

of mass, momentum and energy for a single droplet are

where  𝑚𝑑 = 𝜋𝜌𝑑𝑑𝑑

3/6  is the mass of a single droplet,  𝜌𝑑  and  𝑑𝑑  are the droplet material density 

and diameter, respectively.  𝐮𝑑  is the droplet velocity vector,  𝐅𝑑  and  𝐅𝑝  are the drag and pressure 

gradient force exerting on the droplet.  𝑐𝑝,𝑑  is the droplet heat capacity at constant pressure, and  𝑇𝑑 

is the droplet temperature. 

The droplet evaporation rate,  𝑚̇ 𝑑, in Eq. (5) is modelled through [31  

𝑚̇ 𝑑 = 𝜋𝑑𝑑𝑆ℎ𝐷𝑎𝑏𝜌𝑠ln (1 + 𝑋𝑟), 

where the vapor molar ratio  𝑋𝑟  is estimated from 

𝑋𝑟 =

𝑋𝑆−𝑋𝐶

. 

(8) 

(9) 

Here  𝑋𝐶  is the vapor mole fraction in the surrounding gas, and  𝑋𝑆  is the water vapor mole fraction 

at the droplet surface, calculated using Raoult’s Law, i.e.,   

𝑋𝑆 = 𝑋𝑚

𝑝𝑠𝑎𝑡
𝑝

.   

(10) 

𝑋𝑚  is the mole fraction of the condensed species in the liquid phase.  𝑝𝑠𝑎𝑡  is the saturation pressure 

and is a function of droplet temperature  𝑇𝑑  [32 , i.e., 

𝑝𝑠𝑎𝑡 = 𝑝 ∙ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (𝑐1 +

𝑇𝑑

+ 𝑐3𝑙𝑛𝑇𝑑 + 𝑐4𝑇𝑑

𝑐5), 

(11) 

where the constants  𝑐𝑖  can be found from Ref. [32 . Moreover, in Eq. (8),  𝜌𝑆 = 𝑝𝑆𝑊𝑚/𝑅𝑇𝑆  is the 

vapor density at the droplet surface, where  𝑝𝑆  is the surface vapor pressure and  𝑇𝑠 = (𝑇 + 2𝑇𝑑)/3 

is the droplet surface temperature.  𝐷𝑎𝑏  is the vapor diffusivity in the gaseous mixture [33 , i.e., 

𝐷𝑎𝑏 = 3.6059 × 10−3 × (1.8𝑇𝑠)1.75 ×

where  𝛼𝑙  and  𝛽𝑙  are the model constants from Ref. [34 .

where  Sc  is  the  Schmidt  number  of  gas  phase. The  droplet  Reynolds  number  in  Eq.  (13),  𝑅𝑒𝑑   is

Besides, the pressure gradient force  𝐅𝑝  in Eq. (6) is 

𝐅𝑝 = −𝑉𝑑∇𝑝. 

Here  𝑉𝑑  is the volume of a single water droplet. 

The convective heat transfer rate  𝑄̇ 𝑐  in Eq. (7) is calculated from 

𝑄̇ 𝑐 = ℎ𝑐𝐴𝑑(𝑇 − 𝑇𝑑), 

(14) 

(15) 

(16)

where  ℎ𝑐  is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and computed using the correlation by Ranz and

where Nu and Pr are the Nusselt and Prandtl numbers of gas phase, respectively. In addition, the heat 

transfer associated with droplet evaporation,  𝑄̇ 𝑙𝑎𝑡  in Eq. (7), is 

𝑄̇ 𝑙𝑎𝑡 = −𝑚̇ 𝑑ℎ(𝑇𝑑), 

(20) 

where  ℎ(𝑇𝑑)  is the latent heat of vaporization at the droplet temperature  𝑇𝑑. 

Two-way coupling between the gas and liquid phases is implemented through Particle-source-in-

cell (PSI-CELL) approach [37 . The terms,  𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠,  𝐒𝑚𝑜𝑚,  𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦  and  𝑆𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑠,𝑚  in Eqs. (1)−(4),

(24) 

Here  𝑉𝑐   is  the  CFD  cell  volume,  𝑁𝑑   is  the  droplet  number  in  one  cell,  and  ℎ𝑔   the  water  vapor 

enthalpy at the droplet temperature. Due to the dilute and fine sprays considered, the hydrodynamic 

force work by the droplet phase is neglected in Eq. (23). 

2.3 Computational method 

For the gas phase, cell-centered fine volume method is used to discretizing Eqs. (1)−(4). Second-

order implicit backward method is employed for temporal discretization and the time step is about 

5×10-11  s.  The  MUSCL-type  Riemann-solver-free  scheme  by  Kurganov  et  al.  [38    is  used  for  the 

convective terms in the momentum equations, whilst the total variation diminishing scheme for the 

convective terms in energy and species equations. Also, second-order central differencing scheme is 

applied  for  the  diffusion  terms  in  Eqs.  (2)− (4).  Chemistry  integration  is  performed  with  a  Euler 

implicit method, and its accuracy has been confirmed with other ordinary differential equation solvers 

in our recent work [24 . A hydrogen mechanism with 9 species and 19 reactions [39  is used, which is 

validated against measured ignition delay and detonation cell size [24 .   

For the liquid phase, the water droplets are tracked based on their barycentric coordinates. The 

equations, i.e., Eqs. (5)−(7), are solved by first-order Euler method and the right-hand terms (e.g.,  𝑚̇ 𝑑 

in  Eq.  5)  are  integrated  in  a  semi-implicit  approach.  Meanwhile,  the  gas  properties  at  the  droplet 

location are interpolated from gas phase simulation results.   

The above numerical methods in the RYrhoCentralFoam solver have been extensively validated 

and  verified  against  the  experimental  or  theoretical  data  in  different  detonation  and  shock 

benchmarking problems [24 . It has been successfully applied for modelling various detonation and 

supersonic combustion problems [4043 . In particular, the accuracy of RYrhoCentralFoam in ODW 

simulations is also verified and we find that it is comparable with that of the results by Tian et al. [44

3. Physical model and numerical implementation 

Oblique detonations induced by a semi-infinite wedge with an inflow of gas-liquid two-phase 

mixtures are studied in this work. A two-dimensional configuration is considered, as illustrated in 

Fig. 1. The simulated domain is enclosed by the dashed lines. The x (y) axis is parallel (normal) to 

the wedge surface, whilst the origin lies at the leading edge of the wedge.  Note that the length (x-

direction)  of  the  domain  is  adjusted  in  different  simulations,  to  ensure  that  oblique  detonation 

morphology of interest is fully captured. The wedge angle is θ = 25° in our simulations. 

Dirichlet  conditions  are  enforced  for  gas  properties  (e.g.,  species  mass  fractions,  velocity, 

temperature,  and  pressure)  at  the  left  and  top  boundaries  in  Fig.  1.  The  gas  composition  of  the 

incoming  mixtures  is hydrogen and  oxygen with 70%  (by vol.)  argon  dilution. Two  equivalence 

ratios are studied, i.e., ϕ = 1.0 and 0.5. Therefore, the species mole ratio follows H2/O2/Ar = 2ϕ/1/7. 

Based on our simulations, they respectively correspond to abrupt and smooth transition from OSW 

to  ODW  [6,45  ,  and  therefore  it  is  favorable  to  examine  how  these  two  modes  respond  to  the 

dispersed droplets. The incoming flow velocity is 2447 m/s (e.g., inflow gas Mach number is 7.0 

for ϕ = 1.0, whereas 7.3 for ϕ = 0.5), whereas the temperature and pressure are 298 K and 1.0 atm, 

respectively.  Besides,  the  outlet  is  non-reflective,  whilst  non-slip  and  adiabatic  conditions  are 

employed for the wedge surface. A rebound condition is  applied  for droplet-wall interactions, in

hydrogen/oxidant mixtures with water droplets OSWβODWComputationaldomainODWContact surfaceTransitionθOutflowInflowWedge surfaceβOSW 
 
which the normal component of droplet velocities is reversed after wall collision.   

Ultrafine water droplets are loaded in the incoming flows, to mimic a  highly humid or foggy 

atmosphere. They enter the domain from left and top boundaries, as marked in Fig. 1. The droplets 

are assumed to be spherical, with initial diameter of  dd

0  = 1 μm. Such small diameter is reasonable, 

because the incoming flows are compressed by the preceding shocks in the inlet [1,46,47  and the 

droplets  may  have  been  aerodynamically  fragmented.  The  droplet  initial  material  density,  heat 

capacity,  and  temperature  are  997  kg/m3,  4187  J/kg/K,  and  298  K,  respectively.  The  droplet 

injection velocity is assumed to be identical to that of the local carrier gas (i.e., initial slip velocity 

is zero). In our simulations, we consider the following  droplet mass flow rates, i.e.,  𝑓𝑑  = 0.208, 

0.416, 0.624, 0.832 and 1.041 g/s. 

The computational domain in Fig. 1 is discretized with Cartersian cells. The background mesh 

size  is  16×16  μm2,  based  on  which  two  additional  levels  of  mesh  refinement  are  made  with 

OpenFOAM refineMesh utility near the OSW and ODW, as well as the post-OSW and -ODW areas. 

This leads to a cell size of 4×4 μm2 in the foregoing locations to sufficiently resolve the significant 

characteristics of OSW and ODW. The half-reaction lengths in Chapman-Jouguet detonations with 

ϕ  =  0.5  and  1.0  are  about  174  and  69  μm,  respectively,  calculated  with  Shock  and  Detonation 

Toolbox  [48 . As  such,  they  correspond  to  about  44  and  17  cells  in  the  half-reaction  zone. This 

resolution  is  comparable  with  or  even  finer  than  those  for  gaseous  ODW  simulations  [9,4951 . 

Considering  the  droplet  evaporation  and  heat  absorption  from  the  gas  phase,  more  cells  can  be 

expected  due  to  the  thickened  half-reaction  zone  in  spray  detonations  [52,53 .  Mesh  sensitivity 

analysis (presented in supplementary document) has shown that further refining the mesh does not 

change the results of the present ODW simulations.

4. Results 

4.1 Stoichiometric H2/O2/Ar mixture 

4.1.1 ODW characteristics 

Oblique detonations in stoichiometric H2/O2/Ar mixtures with different water mass flow rates 

(i.e.,  𝑓𝑑  = 0.208–0.832 g/s) are shown in Fig. 2, about the gas temperature and pressure gradient 

magnitude.  Generally,  the  ODW  morphology  is  considerably  influenced  by  the  dispersed  water 

droplets,  although  the  ODWs  can  stably  stand  in  the  supersonic  two-phase  flows  in  all  cases. 

However,  compared  with  the  gas-only  results  in  Fig.  2(a),  the  ODW  surface  tends  to  be  more 

cellular, and the distance between the transverse waves slightly increases as the droplet mass flow 

rate  increases,  as  evidenced  from  the  pressure  gradient  distributions,  which  indicates  more 

pronounced instability of the oblique detonative waves [9,49 . Evident from Fig. 2(a) is an abrupt 

OSW-ODW transition in gas-only mixture, with a salient multi-wave point (annotated as “transition 

point”). This is also predicted by Teng et al. [54 , under the same fuel and inflow conditions.  In 

Figs. 2(b)−2(e), when the water droplets are loaded, this mode remains, but the transition location 

recedes when  𝑓𝑑  gradually increases., which will be further discussed in Section 5.1. 

A  closer  inspection  of  Fig.  2  also  reveals  a  fundamental  change  of  the  flow  structure  in  the 

induction zone when water droplets are loaded. When  𝑓𝑑  ≥ 0.624 g/s in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e), C-shaped 

compression / pressure waves with upper and lower branches can be found close to the transition 

point (see the inset of Fig. 2d). The upper compression waves interact with the incoming droplets, 

and their leading edges are distorted. The lower pressure wave is still weak with  𝑓𝑑  = 0.624 g/s but 

become stronger when  𝑓𝑑  is further increased to 0.832 g/s, which is marked as CW2 in Fig. 2(e). 

In general, the intensity of CW1 is much higher than that of CW2, as can be found from the inset 

of Fig. 2(e). The C-shaped structure is shown to  regularly oscillate with moving transition point, 

which results in a dynamic stabilization of the ODW. This can be clearly seen from the animation 

submitted  with  this  manuscript.  As  𝑓𝑑   increases,  the  wave  structure  underneath  the  transition 

becomes more complicated, characterized by the interactions between shock waves / shocklets and 

12 

compression waves.   

The  distributions of post-OSW gas temperature  and  pressure with various  𝑓𝑑  are  shown in 

Fig. 3, which are extracted  along y = 0.3 mm. As  𝑓𝑑  increases, the OSW gradually recedes with 

larger x coordinates, whilst the temperature behind the OSW decreases. The latter can also be seen 

from the temperature contours in Fig. 2, which is caused by the heat absorption for droplet heating 

and gasification. Moreover, the pressure experiences a jump across oblique shock waves. Various 

pressure peaks are  observable behind the OSW. The pressure peaks (e.g.,  𝑓𝑑  = 0 and 0.208 g/s) 

corresponds to the position of characteristic wave structures behind the OSW, such as compression 

waves,  transverse  shock  wave  and  reflected  shock.  The  reader  should  be  reminded  that  with 

increased droplet mass flow rates, the position of multi-wave point moves downstream and off the 

wedge surface. Therefore, the position of y = 0.3 mm actually corresponds to different part of the 

post-OSW structure, as marked by the white lines in the insets of Fig. 2.

Figure 4 shows the distributions of the reactive fronts with different water droplet mass flow 

rates. The reaction front can be identified through high combustion heat release rate (HRR). When 

𝑓𝑑  = 0.208 g/s in Fig. 4(a), the deflagrative combustion is initiated at location #1 (about  x = 0.39 

mm). At around x = 2 mm, detonative combustion is initiated due to the mutual enhancement of the 

local  heat  release  and  shock  wave,  with  HRR  larger  than  5×1013  J/m3s.  This  reaction  front 

distribution is similar to that in gas-only mixture (not shown here) corresponding to Fig. 2(a). When 

𝑓𝑑  is further increased to 0.624 g/s, bifurcation of the reaction front appears, with multiple initiation 

loci and segmented reaction fronts. Figure 4(b) shows that besides #1, a new initiation location #2 

is present at around x = 3 mm. The upper and lower branches of the C-shaped reaction fronts starting 

from #2 correspond to detonation and deflagration waves, respectively. Similar C-shaped reaction 

fronts  are  also  observed  in  gaseous  ODW  with  stratified  inflowing  premixtures  [14,16   and  are 

attributed to the non-uniform mixture composition near the wedge surface. Besides, the deflagrative 

fronts  extending  from  #1  and  #2  intersect  at  around  x  =  6  mm,  resulting  in  a  spatially  delayed 

deflagration fronts between #1 and #2, as compared to the reaction front morphology in Fig. 4(a) 

and gas-only mixture. 

In Fig. 4(c), when  𝑓𝑑  = 0.832 g/s, the distributions of reaction fronts in the induction zone 

become more complicated. They become nominally zigzagged, with three reaction initiation points,

i.e., #1, #2, and #3. The deflagrative front interaction position extending from the locations #1 and 

#2 is  more  downstream, at about  x  = 12 mm. The distance between  the  deflagrative fronts  from 

different initiation locations increases, and the heat release rate of combustion waves far away from 

the main multi-wave point decreases. These peculiar distributions of reaction fronts in Fig. 4 are 

caused by the dispersed droplets in the shocked gas, which will be examined through the droplet 

distribution in Section 4.1.2. 

Figure 5: Distribution of droplet volume fraction.  𝑓𝑑  = 0.832 g/s. Solid line: OSW and ODW. 

4.1.2 Droplet distribution 

Figure 5 shows the distribution of droplet volume fraction when  𝑓𝑑  = 0.832 g/s. It is calcualed 

from the ratio of total droplet volume to gas volume in each CFD cell. Apparently, behind the OSW, 

there are two distinct zones (i.e., A and B) with higher volume fractions and hence larger droplet 

concentrations.  Why  the  droplets  are  accummulated  there  will  be  interpreted  in  Figs.  6  and  7. 

Figures  6(a) − 6(d)  respectively  shows  the  Lagrangian  droplets  colored  by  their  velocity, 

temperature,  and  diameter.  Note  that  the  colorless  areas  indicate  that  the  droplets  have  already 

vaporized there. It can be seen from Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) that both x- and y-velocities are generally 

reduced behind both OSW and ODW. This is because  the local flow decelerates after the shocks, 

and ultrafine droplets (1 µm in this study) can respond to the gas speed variations quickly due to 

their small Stokes numbers. However, behind the OSW, the y-direction velocities are greater than 

zero (50–100 m/s), and these droplet streams move along the narrow “channel” between the two

deflagration fronts extending from #2 and #3, respectively. This leads to a local acumulation of the 

water droplets in zone A, indicated in Fig. 5. One can see from Fig. 6(c) that the temperatures of 

these droplets have been elevated to above 400 K (close to the local saturation temperature), due to 

the  short  thermal  response  time  of  fine  droplets.  After  a  finite  distance  behind  OSW,  droplet 

evaporation starts. This can be featured by reduced droplet size in Fig. 6(d) and pronounced mass 

transfer  ∆𝑚  (i.e., water vapor) from the liquid phase to gas phase in Fig. 6(e). Significant energy 

absoprtion (∆𝐸  < 0) from the gas phase can also be observed in Fig. 6(f). These mass and energy 

transfer  with  water  mists  significantly  delay  gas  chemistry  initiation,  which  hence  leads  to 

bifurcation between the leading points #2 and #3 marked in Fig. 4, and distorts the reaction fronts 

(see the HRR isolines in Fig. 6).

To elucidate the formation of zone B in Fig. 5, Fig. 7 shows the close-up view near the leading 

edge. The oncoming droplets bounce up on the wedge and hence have an positive y-velocity, see 

Fig. 7(b) or Fig. 6(b). This results in an area with high water concentration, corresponding to zone 

B. Below the dashed line, the droplets have higher temperature and reduced diameter, because they 

are heated by the hot boundary layer and thereby strongly vaporize. This can be also corroborated 

by considerable mass and energy transfer between the droplet and gas phase, as illustrated in Figs. 

7(e) and 7(f). Therefore, it has been shown that heating and evaporation of high-concentration water

droplets  may  change  the  local  thermochemical  states  in  zones A  and  B,  thereby  bifurcating  the 

reaction fronts. Similar observations are also made for other cases when reaction front bifurcation 

is present, e.g.,  𝑓𝑑  = 0.624 g/s (due to relatively low droplet addition, only zone B is seen). How 

the  chemical  reactions  modulated  by  the  water  mists  in  zones A  and  B  will  be  quantified  with 

chemical explosive mode analysis in Section 5.2. 

4.2 Lean H2/O2/Ar mixture 

4.2.1 ODW characteristics 

Fuel-lean H2/O2/Ar mixture (ϕ = 0.5) with different  water mass flow rates is studied in this 

section. The distributions of gas temperature and pressure gradient magnitude  are shown in Fig. 8, 

and the evolutions of ODW surface can be found from the animation submitted with this manuscript. 

Addition of water droplets  does  not change the initiation mode, compared to the purely gaseous 

case  in  Fig.  8(a).  Different  from  the  stoichiometric  mixtures,  the  oblique  detonation  is  initiated 

through a smooth transition through a curved shock wave, for all studied flow rates. Evident from 

Fig.  8  is  the  receding  transition  point  with  increased  droplet  mass  flow  rate.  Moreover,  two 

compression waves (marked as “CWs”) are observed around the transition point, which intersect 

with the OSW. The latter becomes concaved with respect to the flows, and hence is intensified. Due 

to the evaporation and motion of the droplets in the induction zone, the shocked gas temperature  

decreases, which is also demonstrated from the profiles at y = 0.3 mm in Fig. 9. To clarify, since 

the data in Fig. 9 are extracted along a fixed height off the wedge (see the white lines in the insets 

of Fig.  8)  and  the  OSW-ODW-CW complex moves  as  𝑓𝑑  increases, the  reduced  pressure peaks 

does not mean that the intensities of the CW are weakened.

Figure 10 demonstrates the distributions of the combustion heat release rate with three water 

mass  flow  rates,  i.e.,  𝑓𝑑  =  0.208,  0.624  and  0.832  g/s. When  𝑓𝑑  is  0.208  g/s  in  Fig.  10(a),  the 

deflagrative combustion is initiated at location #1 (about x = 0.33 mm) near the wedge surface. The 

deflagration front exists when  x < 1.3 mm, which  develops into detonation  beyond  x = 1.3 mm, 

characterized by much higher heat release rate (over 1×1013 J/m3/s). This is caused by the coherent 

coupling between the chemical reactions and shock/compression wave (see CWs in Fig. 8). Further 

downstream, the reaction front smoothly evolves into the ODW. When  𝑓𝑑  is further increased to 

0.624 g/s in Fig. 10(b), slight distortion of the reaction front is observed at location #2. Meanwhile, 

the transition from deflagration to detonation wave is also delayed, now at x = 2.2 mm. In Fig. 10(c), 

the foregoing two features becomes more outstanding. Meanwhile, bifurcation of the reaction front 

appears, resulting in two initiation locations, i.e., #1 and #3, and a S-shaped morphology.

4.2.2 Droplet distribution 

Figure 11 shows the droplet volume fraction, corresponding to  the conditions in  Fig. 10(c). 

Behind the OSW and ODW (the solid line), considerable droplets exist, featured by  finite droplet 

volume fractions, which leads to gas-liquid heterogeneous mixtures. Relatively higher water droplet 

concentrations can be observed extending from the wedge edge, marked as zone C in Fig. 11. The 

formation of this zone share the similar mechanism with  zone B in Fig. 5, due to the droplet-wall 

interactions.  Plotted  in  Fig.  12  are  the  Lagrangian  droplets  colored  by  velocity,  temperature, 

diameter, as well as the  interphase  mass and energy exchange when  𝑓𝑑  is 0.832 g/s. Behind the 

OSW and ODW, the droplet velocites generally have similar distributions, which is different from 

the situations of the abtupt transition mode in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). This can be attributed to the flow 

field difference behind OSW and ODW in these two transition modes. After crossing the oblique 

shock wave, the droplets are heated to above 400 K, but droplet diameter remains unchanged, as 

shown in Figs. 12(c) and 12(d). After a certain distance behind OSW, the droplets begin to evaporate 

under local saturation temperature. Droplet evaporation has significant mass transfer  ∆𝑚  with the 

surrounding  gas  mixtures  and  absorbs  a  lot  of  energy  (∆𝐸<  0)  from  it  in  Figs.  12(e)  and  12(f).

Accordingly the droplet diameter decreases in Fig. 12(d). For lean H2/O2/Ar mixtures, the droplet 

penetration distance normal to the detonation surface is close to that behind the OSW during thermal 

response time. Nonetheless, the area where droplets are present is relatively short behind the ODW 

due to the gas temperature behind ODW is relatively high. This can be seen from the magnitudes 

of mass and energy transfers in Figs. 12(e) and 12(f). 

5. Discussion 

5.1 Characteristic location and wave angle 

Figure  13  summarizes  the  initiation  location,  transition  location  and  wave  angles  from  the 

stoichiometric and fuel-lean cases. The initiation location  𝐿𝑖  is defined as the distance from  the 

wedge  tip  to  the  position  with  10%  of  the  maximum  HRR  along  the  wedge  surface,  while  the 

transition location  𝐿𝑡  is defined as the distance (x-direction) from the wedge tip to the OSW-ODW 

transition  locus.  See  their  indications  in  Figs.  2  and  8.  It  is  shown  from  Fig.  13(a)  that  for  two 

mixtures,  𝐿𝑖   linearly  increases  with  the  droplet  mass  flow  rate.  This  indicates  the  increased 

influences of droplet heating and evaporation on the initiation location. However,  𝐿𝑖  in the fuel-

lean  mixtures  are  generally  smaller  compared  to  the  counterpart  from  the  stoichiometric  ones. 

Specifically,  when  𝑓𝑑   =  0.832  g/s,  for  the  stoichiometric  and  fuel-lean  mixture  cases, 𝐿𝑖   only 

increases  15.1%  and  10.8%  respectively,  relative  to  the  gas-only  case.  This  is  because  the 

temperature and pressure behind OSW are generally higher in fuel-lean mixtures, for instance, see 

Figs.  3  and  9.  The  thermochemical  conditions  behind  the  OSW  directly  influences  the  reaction 

initiation,  and  therefore  𝐿𝑖   lies  more  upstream.  Evident  from  Fig.  13(b)  is  that  the  transition 

locations  from the two  mixtures  are  more  different. The transition location  𝐿𝑡  in  stoichiometric 

mixtures changes with  𝑓𝑑  exponentially. However, only linear variation of  𝐿𝑡  is observed in fuel-

lean cases. This leads to increased  difference between their transition locations when the droplet 

loading is high, such as 0.624 and 0.832 g/s.  Therefore, for fuel-lean mixtures, the sensitivity of 

these  characteristic  locations  to  the  droplet  loading  variations  is  milder  compared  to  that  in 

24 

 
stoichiometric  cases.  This  implies  that  the  fuel-lean  mixtures  with  smooth  shock-to-detonation 

transition  mode  are  more  stable  and  resilient  than  the  stoichiometric  cases.  This  resilence 

dinctinction is also observed by Iwata et al. when they consider an inhomogeneous H 2-air mixture 

[14 , although no explanations are provded from their studies. 

Figure 13 Initiation location (a), transition location (b), OSW angle (c), and ODW angle (d) as 
functions of droplet mass flow rate. Thereotical results are from shock polar analysis [55 . 

The evaporating water droplets also influence the OSW and ODW angles, as seen from Figs. 

13(c)  and  13(d). The  definitions  of  shock/detonation  angles,  𝛽OSW  and  𝛽ODW,  are  annotated  in 

Fig. 1. The predicted angles in the droplet-free cases well reproduce the theoretical results from the 

shock polar analysis [55 . Besides, both  𝛽OSW  and  𝛽ODW  in spray detonations are lower than the 

values  of  droplet-free  case. As  𝑓𝑑  increases,  both  angles  decrease  monotonically.  For  the  OSW 

angle, this tendency can be justified by the fact that the oblqiue shock is attentuated by the droplet

momentum  and  energy  extraction  when  they  cross  the  shock  front  [56 ,57  .  This  can  also  be 

comfirmed through the continuously delayed OSW position in Figs. 3 and 9. Decreased shock angle 

generally leads to reduced temperature and pressure behind it. This also modulates the post-shock 

thermodynanic conditions, thereby jointly influencing chemical reaction induction together with in-

situ droplet heating and evaporation behind the OSW. For ODW angle, this is because higher droplet 

concentration would lead to more energy aborption from the gas phase and hence lower combustion 

heat release, which would result in smaller ODW angle based on the thermodynamic relations [7,58 . 

Specifically,  when  𝑓𝑑   is  0.832  g/s,   𝛽OSW   decreases  8.28%  and  5.77%  respectively  in  the 

stoichiometric and fuel-lean mixtures, relative to the gas-only case. However,  𝛽ODW  decreases by 

about  4.95%  and  8.93%,  respectively.  In  spite  of  the  above  differences,  the  oblique  shock  and 

detonation waves have generally good stability when dispersed droplets are loaded in the oncoming 

flows and therefore interact with the gas mixture in the induction zone. 

5.2 Chemical timescale and structure 

The chemical explosive mode analysis [59,62  is employed to quantify the chemical reaction 

information of oblique detonations. It has been successfully used for analysing the induction zone 

of detonations [52,63,64 , and detailed information about this method can be found in Refs. [59,60 . 

Although the smooth and abrupt  OSW-ODW transition modes  have been discussed  in numerous 

studies  [12,15,44,45,50 ,  nonetheless,  limited  attention  has  been  paid  to  their  intrinsic  chemical 

structures. Figure 14 shows the distributions of chemical timescale  𝜏𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚  (in logarithmic scale) of 

stoichiometric H2/O2/Ar oblique detonations in droplet-free and two-phase (𝑓𝑑  = 0.832 g/s) cases. 

Here, 𝜏𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚   is  calculated  from  the  reciprocal  of  the  real  part  of  eigen  values  𝜆𝐸   of  chemical 

Jacobian  matrix  [59 .  For  better  illustration,  only  chemical  explosive  areas  with  positive  eigen 

values (hence excluding the fresh and burned  areas) are shown. They correspond to the induction 

zones behind the shocks. The profiles of  𝜆𝐸  and key thermochemical quantities along lines 1-4 in 

Fig. 14 are shown in Fig. 15. 

26 

 
We  first  look  at  the  droplet-free  case  in  Fig.  14(a).  The  oncoming  gas  changes  from  non-

explosive  to  explosive  state  because  of  compression  by  the  OSW  (dotted  lines  in  Fig.  15). 

Accordingly,  the  chemical  timescale  is  considerably  reduced,  generally  to  less  than  10-7.5  s.  For 

instance,  along  line  2,  𝜏𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚   is  continuously  reduced  towards  the  deflagration  and  detonation 

surfaces.  The  corresponding  𝜆𝐸   gradually  increases  and  peaks  ahead  of  the  reaction  front 

(corresponding to  𝜆𝐸  = 0 [59 ), as seen from  Fig. 15. Near the transition location (e.g., line 1), 

𝜏𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑚  is further lowered to 10-8 s and there is a bump of  𝜆𝐸, indicating the strong mixture reactivity 

for  local  detonative  combustion.  Beyond  the  transition  point,  the  chemical  timescale  of  the 

relatively narrow induction zone of ODW is generally 10-8 s.

stoichiometric H2/O2/Ar mixture: (a)  𝑓𝑑  = 0 and (b)  𝑓𝑑  = 0.832 g/s. 

When the  water droplets are loaded, the results  in Fig. 14(b) demonstrate that  the chemical 

timescale near the transition point increases and the chemically more explosive region (with higher 

𝜆𝐸 )  becomes  narrower,  compared  to  that  of  the  droplet-free  case.  This  can  be  found  through

comparing the results in Figs. 15(d) and 15(c). Moreover, there are two salient striped areas with 

relatively high chemical timescale (up to 10-3 s) and much lower  𝜆𝐸  (e.g., see line 4 in Fig. 15d), 

which corresponds to zones A and B in Fig. 5. This implies that the chemical explosion propensity 

of the shocked gas is largely reduced due to the interactions with the evaporating water mists and 

hence the reaction fronts are distorted in the induction zone.

Figures 16 and 17 show the counterpart results from the fuel-lean (ϕ = 0.5) H2/O2/Ar mixture 

with  𝑓𝑑  = 0 and 0.832 g/s. Similar to the results in Fig. 14, the chemically explosive gas mixture 

also  exists  in  the  induction  zones.  However,  we  can  observe  interesting  differences  about  the 

distribution  of  timescale  and  eigen  value  near  the  transition  locations.  Specifically,  for  smooth 

transition here, the gas mixture reactivity is rapidly increased behind OSW and then levels off for 

a distance before the deflagration front, see the variations of  𝜆𝐸  in Fig. 17(a). This is caused by 

the compression of the curved shock, which is intensified by the compression waves . The highly 

reduced reaction timescale immediately  behind  the shock is kinetically  favourable to induce the 

coherent  interactions  between  the  lead  shock  and  reaction  front  in  an  ODW.  Therefore,  the 

mechanism for smooth transition is essentially different from the abrupt mode in Fig. 14 and 15. In

the latter, the most chemically explosive mixture is formed by the re-compression of the shocks in 

the  induction  zone,  which  results  in  detonative  combustion  as  demonstrated  in  Fig.  4.  This 

detonation wave further intersects with the OSW and leads to an ODW.   

When the water mists are added in the fuel-lean mixture, the gas reactivity near the transition 

point  is  slightly  affected,  see  Fig.  17(c).  More  pronounced  influence  lies  in  zone  C  with  higher 

droplet concentration  (marked in Fig. 11, corresponding to line 4), and its chemical timescale is 

decreased to 10-7-10-6.8 s. Even so, it is still much shorter (more reactive) than that in zones A and 

B  in  Fig.  14.  Therefore,  the  results  in  Figs.  16  and  17  well  justify  why  the  ODW  with  smooth 

transition  is  more  resilient  for  droplet-laden  approach  flows  from  the  perspective  of  chemical 

explosiveness and characteristic timescale.

5.3 Physical and chemical effects of water vapor 

To elucidate how the physical and chemical effects of the water vapour, we conduct numerical 

experiments, following Refs. [6567 . Both stoichiometric and lean mixtures are considered and  𝑓𝑑 

= 0.832 g/s. If droplet evaporation is considered, the water vapor is released from the liquid droplets. 

It is well known that H2O species can participate in gas phase chemical reactions, acting as reactant 

or third-body species. This leads to possible chemical effects of the water species in the reaction 

system. In our experiments, we introduce an artificial species H2O(v) in the chemical mechanism, 

to  differentiate  from  the  water  species  as  combustion  product,  H2O(c).  H2O(v)  has  the  same 

thermodynamic and transport properties as the real water species H2O(c). 

Four cases are compared, as tabulated in Table 1. In case a, the droplet evaporation model is

turned off and hence the water vapor effects (including physical and chemical ones) are completely 

ruled out. Note in passing that case a is still a spray detonation modelling, considering momentum 

and energy transfer between dispersed and continuous phases.  Case b only considers the physical 

effects (including compositional dilution and thermodynamic parameter modulation), whilst case c 

incorporates the chemical (but only as third-body species) effect. Case d has the full models, already 

discussed in Section 4. It is reminded that the combustion product water H2O(c) plays a full role in 

these tests.

H2/O2/Ar  mixtures.  For  non-evaporating  water  droplets  in  case  a  (Fig.  18a),  the  structure  of  the 

induction zone is similar to the gas-only case in Fig. 2(a). Through the results in Fig. 18, one can 

see that the water vapor addition plays a significant role in induction zone and ODW morphology. 

The physical effects of water vapor can be examined in Figs. 18(a) and 18(b): addition of H2O(v) 

considerably delays the deflagration/detonation initiation and change the induction zone structure. 

Figure  20  quantifies  the  predicted  transition/initiation  locations  and  OSW/ODW  angles  when 

different roles of H2O(v) are considered. One can see that, compared to case a, transition location 

and  ODW  angle  in  case  b  increases  by  around  189%  and  15%,  respectively.  Nonetheless,  t he 

initiation location and OSW angle are shown to have slight increase and decrease, respectively. This 

is due to the energy transfer between the surrounding gas mixtures and the post-shock water droplets, 

resulting in a decrease in the total energy of the post-shock gas. It means that compositional dilution 

and/or thermodynamic parameter variation by the water vapor  results in significant differences in 

ODW initiation and behaviours. 

When  H2O(v) third-body effects  are considered in  Fig. 18(c), the transition location further 

moves downstream to about x = 10.7 mm and the ODW angle increases to 57.9º, compared to the 

results in Fig. 18(b). Meanwhile, in Fig. 18(c), a new “channel” with low temperature  (also high 

chemical timescale as quantified in Section 5.1) appears, which disconnect the combustion waves 

near  the  multi-wave  point  and  the  wedge  surface.  This  is  due  to  local  high  concentration  water 

vapor 

and  hence 

enhanced 

third-body 

recombination 

elementary 

reactions 

(e.g., 

H+OH+M→H2O+M,  H+H+M→H2+M  and  H+O2+M→HO2+M).  Furthermore, 

the  overall 

OSW/ODW flow field in Fig. 18(c) is close to that in case d in Fig. 18(d). Since the only difference 

between them is H2O(v) as a reactant, we can conjecture that the H2O(v) reactant effects are limited. 

However, a closer inspection of Figs. 18(c) and 18(d) reveals that the ODW surfaces still differ. It 

can be found from Fig.  20 that the ODW angle in case d is  about 46.6º, much lower than that in 

case c. Water vapor as reactants probably shifts the elementary reactions to generate more radicals, 

and therefore less heat is released by exothermic reactions (which is consistent with the lower post-

ODW temperature demonstrated in Fig. 18d, compared to Fig. 18c), thereby a lower ODW angle.

Figure  19  show  the  results  from  the  numerical  experiments  based  on  fuel-lean  mixture. 

Through comparing Figs. 8(a) and 19(a), one can see that non-evaporating droplets slightly delay 

the detonation initiation. As shown in Fig. 20, the transition location increases from 2.25 to 2.81 

mm. In addition, due to droplet heating and momentum absorption, the post-shock and -detonation 

temperatures are generally reduced. In Fig. 19(b), in which only physical effects are included, the 

foregoing features are more pronounced. However, different from the stoichiometric mixture results, 

the  chemical  effects  of  H2O(v)  almost  do  not  affect  the  macroscopic  flow  structures, 

transition/initiation locations, and ODW angles, as quantified in Fig. 20. Besides, for both abrupt 

and smooth transitions, the OSW angle is negligibly affected by the chemical effects of H2O(v). 

To sum  up, the key information from the  above  experiments include:  (1)  either physical or 

chemical effects of water vapor from liquid droplets do not change the OSW/ODW transition mode; 

(2) both effects affect the transition location and ODW angle when abrupt transition (ϕ = 1.0 in this 

study) occurs, but only the physical ones are important for smooth transition (ϕ = 0.5); (3) about 

the chemical effects of the H2O(v) in abrupt transition, the third-body effects are dominant, although 

H2O(v) also plays a discernible role as reactant for elementary reactions, thereby modulating the 

ODW front characteristics. 

6. Conclusions 

Two-dimensional wedge-induced oblique detonations in H2/O2/Ar mixtures  with water sprays 

are computationally studied with Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Stoichiometric and fuel-lean mixture 

compositions  are  considered,  in  which  smooth  and  abrupt  transitions  from  oblique  shock  and 

detonation respectively occur. The effects of water droplet mass flow rate on the change of flow and 

chemical structures in the induction zone, as well as the physical and chemical roles of water vapor, 

are discussed. The following conclusions can be drawn: 

(1) The ODW can exist for the studied water droplet mass flow rates for both stoichiometric 

and fuel-lean mixtures. With increased droplet mass flow rate, the induction zone structure of the 

oblique detonation becomes complex. The deflagration front is distorted, which is caused by droplet 

34 

 
accumulation  locally  and  therefore  higher  water  mist  concentration,  subject  to  different  flow 

structures  in  the  stoichiometric  and  lean  mixtures.  Moreover,  the  transition  from  OSW  to  ODW 

does not change when different concentrations of water sprays are loaded.   

(2) For both stoichiometric and fuel-lean mixture, the initiation location and transition location 

monotonically increase with droplet mass  flow rate. This is caused by enhanced effects of water 

droplet evaporation  and water vapour  dilution in the induction  zone.  In particular, the transition 

location increases exponentially  in the stoichiometry case. Moreover, the OSW and ODW  angles 

decrease with increasing droplet mass flow rate. In general, for fuel-lean mixtures, the sensitivity 

of  characteristic  locations  to  the  droplet  loading  variations  is  mild.  The  ODW  structures  with 

smooth transition are more stable and hence more resilient than the stoichiometric cases with abrupt 

transition. 

(3) The chemical timescale is computed with the chemical explosive method analysis. It is found 

that the gas between the lead shock and reaction front is intrinsically chemically explosive. For the 

lean mixture, the smooth transition is caused by the highly enhanced reactivity of the gas immediately 

behind  the  curved  shock,  intensified  by  the  compression  waves.  Nonetheless,  the  abrupt  transition 

results from the intersection between the detonation wave (from the coupling between shock wave and 

chemical reactions in the induction zone) and the OSW. With the evaporating water mists, the chemical 

explosion propensity of shocked gas mixtures is reduced. Besides, the degree to which the chemical 

timescale is reduced in fuel-lean mixtures is generally lower than that in the stoichiometric gas. 

(4) Numerical experiments show that physical (composition dilution, thermodynamic state) and 

chemical effects (reactant or third-body species for elementary reactions) caused by water vapor from 

liquid droplets result in significant differences in ODW initiation and morphology. It is seen that both 

effects  affect  the  transition  location  and  ODW  angle  when  abrupt  transition  occurs,  but  only  the 

physical ones are important for smooth transition. As for the chemical effects of the water vapor in 

abrupt transition, the third-body species effects are dominant, although the role as a reactant is also 

discernible from the oblique detonation wave characteristics.
