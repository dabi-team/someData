Abstract

We performed coordinated observations of AR 12205, which produced a C-class ﬂare on 2014
November 11, with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Domeless Solar
Telescope (DST) at Hida Observatory. Using spectral data in the Si IV 1403 ˚A, C II 1335 ˚A,
and Mg II h and k lines from IRIS and the Ca II K, Ca II 8542 ˚A, and Hα lines from DST, we
investigated a moving ﬂare kernel during the ﬂare. In the Mg II h line, the leading edge of the
ﬂare kernel showed the intensity enhancement in the blue wing, and the smaller intensity of
the blue-side peak (h2v) than that of the red-side one (h2r). The blueshift lasted for 9–48 s
with a typical speed of 10.1 ± 2.6 km s−1 and it was followed by the high intensity and the
large redshift with a speed of up to 51 km s−1 detected in the Mg II h line. The large redshift
was a common property for all six lines but the blueshift prior to it was found only in the Mg II
lines. A cloud modeling of the Mg II h line suggests that the blue wing enhancement with such
peak difference can be caused by a chromospheric-temperature (cool) upﬂow. We discuss a
scenario in which an upﬂow of cool plasma is lifted up by expanding hot plasma owing to the
deep penetration of non-thermal electrons into the chromosphere. Furthermore, we found that
the blueshift persisted without any subsequent redshift in the leading edge of the ﬂare kernel
during its decaying phase. The cause of such long-lasting blueshift is also discussed.

1 Introduction

Solar ﬂares are the most energetic phenomena observed in the
solar atmosphere, releasing a huge amount of energy up to
1032 ergs on a typical timescale of minutes to tens of min-
utes. Magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere is released
through magnetic reconnection and converted to various kinds
of energy: kinetic energy of mass ejection, thermal energy of
hot plasma, and non-thermal energy of accelerated particles

(Shibata & Magara 2011). On the basis of observations and
theories, the standard ﬂare reconnection model has been devel-
oped (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp
& Pneuman 1976). From the viewpoint of energy transporta-
tion, it is unclear not only where and how the energy is released,
transported, and converted to thermal and kinetic energy, but
also how the lower atmosphere responds to the energy input.
In chromospheric lines such as the Hα and Ca II H and K, a

pair of long and curved bright areas (ﬂare ribbons) and strongly
bright patches in ﬂare ribbons (ﬂare kernels) have been ob-
served during ﬂares (Svestka 1976). Such chromospheric ﬂares
are thought to be excited by the energy transferred from the
corona into the chromosphere.

A number of authors have proposed mechanisms of the en-
ergy transport from the ﬂare site in the corona to the chromo-
sphere: e.g., electron beams (Brown 1973), thermal conduc-
tion (Hirayama 1974), soft X-ray (SXR) irradiation (Henoux
& Nakagawa 1978), ion beams (Lin et al. 2003), and Alfv´en
waves (Fletcher & Hudson 2008). A beam of accelerated (non-
thermal) electrons is a key mechanism that has been widely dis-
cussed, since strong enhancement of chromospheric (and occa-
sionally photospheric) emission is temporally and spatially cor-
related with hard X-ray (HXR) emission and microwave radia-
tion (e.g., Asai et al. 2012) that are generated by the non-thermal
bremsstrahlung (Brown 1971) and gyrosynchrotron emission
(Takakura & Kai 1966), respectively.

In relation to such a chromospheric heating, hot (8–25 MK)
and dense upﬂow (up to 400 km s−1) along the ﬂare loops has
been detected in the wavelength range of SXR and extreme ul-
traviolet (EUV) during ﬂares (Doschek et al. 1980; Antonucci et
al. 1982; Strong et al. 1984; Milligan 2015), which is called the
chromospheric evaporation. In the chromospheric evaporation
scenario, high-energy (accelerated) particles go into and collide
with the chromospheric plasma, which causes a rapid increase
of temperature and pressure in the chromosphere (Hirayama
1974; Fisher et al. 1985). The heated plasma expands drasti-
cally upward along the magnetic ﬁeld lines almost at its sound
speed. As a result, the plasma is observed as coronal hot loops
in the SXR and EUV. At the same time, the chromospheric
plasma is strongly compressed and the downward propagating
shock waves are excited in the chromosphere, because of the
low chromospheric sound speed. In this compressed region, ra-
diative cooling becomes so effective that the temperature does
not increase so much. Consequently, the density increases more
to keep the pressure balance, which leads to further effective
radiation. Therefore, the chromospheric condensation accom-
panying strong compression and downﬂow takes place. Indeed,
redshifts and enhancements in the red wing (red asymmetry)
have been observed in the chromospheric lines in the impulsive
phase of ﬂares (e.g., ˇSvestka et al. 1962; Ichimoto & Kurokawa
1984; Shoji & Kurokawa 1995; Ding et al. 1995), which can
be explained by condensation downﬂow in the chromosphere.
Ichimoto & Kurokawa (1984) measured redshifts and down-
ward Doppler velocities in the Hα line during ﬂares quanti-
tatively and established that downﬂow (∼ 50 km s−1) can be
explained by the momentum balance with the chromospheric
evaporation upﬂow. This is conﬁrmed by Shoji & Kurokawa
(1995) that investigated other lines such as the Ca II K and He
D3 as well as the Hα line and showed that the velocity derived

from the Hα spectra was consistent with that from the He D3
line (50–100 km s−1).

On the other hand, blue asymmetry in the chromospheric
lines has also been reported ( ˇSvestka et al. 1962; Canﬁeld et al.
1990; Heinzel et al. 1994; Kerr et al. 2015). ˇSvestka et al. (1962)
studied the line asymmetry in 244 spectra of 92 individual ﬂares
observed in the Hα, Ca II H and K, and He I lines. They con-
cluded that 80% of the ﬂares show red asymmetry and 23% of
the ﬂares contain regions with blue asymmetry. Furthermore,
they showed that the blue asymmetry predominantly occurs in
the early phase of the ﬂares. In Heinzel et al. (1994), the Balmer
and Ca II H lines showed blue asymmetry at the same time dur-
ing the onset phase of a ﬂare. Some researchers have attempted
to explain the origin of the blue asymmetry (Canﬁeld et al.
1990; Heinzel et al. 1994; Ding & Fang 1997; Kuridze et al.
2015; Kuridze et al. 2016), but we have not obtained consensus.

The chromosphere in solar ﬂares has been spectroscopi-
cally observed mostly from the ground so far. The frequently-
used lines have been the Balmer lines (mainly the Hα) and the
Ca II H, K, and 8542 ˚A in visible and near infrared. In addi-
tion to them, there are several lines in ultraviolet having strong
emissions from the chromosphere that are not available from the
ground. The Mg II lines are the representative ones. Now we
can use the Mg II h and k lines detected by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS: De Pontieu et al. 2014), which
was launched in 2013. Furthermore, other chromospheric and
transition region lines such as the C II and Si IV lines are also
available with IRIS. With these ultraviolet lines, numerous stud-
ies of solar ﬂares have been conducted. Kerr et al. (2015)
and Liu et al. (2015) studied the response of the Mg II lines
to solar ﬂares and presented the spatial and temporal behav-
ior of the physical quantities. Kerr et al. (2015) showed very
intense, spatially localized energy input at the outer edge of
the ribbon, resulting in redshifts equivalent to velocities of 15–
26 km s−1, line broadenings, and line asymmetry in the most in-
tense sources. Graham & Cauzzi (2015) presented the dynamic
evolution of chromospheric evaporation and condensation in a
ﬂare ribbon. Successive brightenings in the impulsive phase dis-
played the same initial coronal upﬂows of up to 300 km s−1 and
chromospheric downﬂows up to 40 km s−1. See also Li et al.
(2015), Li et al. (2017), and Brosius & Inglis (2017), which in-
vestigated chromospheric evaporation and condensation using
ultraviolet lines by IRIS. Recently, a narrow and dark moving
feature has been observed at the front of ﬂare footpoints in the
He I 10830 ˚A (Xu et al. 2016). Xu et al. 2016 suggest that the-
oretically the dark feature in the He I 10830 ˚A can be produced
under special circumstances by non-thermal electron collisions
or photoionization followed by recombination. This might be
related to the blue asymmetry observed in the chromospheric
lines.

a C5.4 ﬂare on 2014 November 11 simultaneously observed by
IRIS and the Domeless Solar Telescope (DST: Nakai & Hattori
1985) at Hida Observatory of Kyoto University. We show the
temporal and spatial evolution of six chromospheric and tran-
sition region lines in relation to a moving ﬂare kernel that was
observed during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare. In section 2,
we describe the data set and data reduction. Then, observa-
tional description of the ﬂare kernel and our method to analyze
the data are shown in section 3. Section 4 shows the results.
Finally, we discuss the interpretation of observational results
and present the summary in section 5.

2 The data set and data reduction

We performed coordinated observations (HOP 275) of NOAA
AR 12205 located near the disk center (N13◦ W17◦) from 2014
November 10 to 11 with IRIS and DST. The active region pro-
duced a C5.4 ﬂare that started at 23:55 UT on November 10,
peaked at 00:01 UT, and ended at 00:08 UT on November 11
(ﬁgure 1).

IRIS observed the ﬂare at the ﬁxed slit location (sit-and-stare
mode) from 23:48:05 UT on November 10 to 00:36:30 UT on
November 11 (observation time is shown in ﬁgure 1). The ﬁeld
of view (FOV) by the slit-jaw imager (SJI) was 120′′×162′′
with a sampling of 0.′′166 pixel−1. The spatial sampling along
′′166 pixel−1. The
the IRIS slit by the spectrograph was also 0.
temporal cadence was 9.5 s for the spectral data and 29 s for
the SJI ﬁltergrams. In this study, we used the Mg II h 2803 ˚A,
Mg II k 2796 ˚A, C II 1335 ˚A, and Si IV 1403 ˚A lines, which have

the formation temperatures of Log T [K] = 4.0, 4.0, 4.3, and
4.8, respectively (De Pontieu et al. 2014). We used mainly the
Mg II h line rather than the Mg II k line, because another line
locates in the blue wing of the Mg II k line and this causes difﬁ-
culties of correct measurements of characteristic parameters of
the line as described later. The Mg II k line behaves similarly
to and has relatively higher intensity than the Mg II h line. We
note that the signal from the Fe XXI line, which can be used for
the indication of the coronal evaporation upﬂow, was too weak
to be detected.

DST observed the ﬂare from 23:59:08 UT on November 10
to 00:23:25 UT on November 11 (as shown in ﬁgure 1). Raster-
scanned maps by the slit that moved from west to east on the
solar surface were obtained with the horizontal spectrograph on
DST with a repeat cadence of 10 s. We used the spectral data of
the Ca II K 3934 ˚A, Ca II 8542 ˚A, and Hα 6563 ˚A lines, which all
form at around the chromospheric temperature (∼ 104 K). The
data were taken by three identical cameras: Prosilica GE1650,
and the timing to get the data were synchronized in all the cam-
eras. The spatial samplings in the vertical direction to the slit
′′27 pixel−1,
were 0.
0.′′28 pixel−1, and 0.′′36 pixel−1 for the Ca II K, Ca II 8542 ˚A,
and Hα lines, respectively. We note that the actual spatial res-
olution was about 2′′ due to the seeing effect. The spectral
sampling and the velocity that corresponds to the spectral sam-
pling were 15 m ˚A pixel−1 and 1.1 km s−1 for the Ca II K line,
15 m ˚A pixel−1 and 0.5 km s−1 for the Ca II 8542 ˚A line, and
22 m ˚A pixel−1 and 1.0 km s−1 for the Hα line. We used the
spectral data smoothed over ±5, 15, and 10 data points along

′′64 pixel−1 and those along the slit were 0.

spectively because physical parameters cannot be derived due to
the low signal-to-noise ratio of them. This smoothing does not
affect the measurements of velocities described in the section 3.
The smoothing leads an artiﬁcial broadening of proﬁles, but the
absolute values of line widths are not important in this study.

Time proﬁles of the high-energy emissions are obtained
by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH: Nakajima et al.
1994) and the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM: Meegan
et al. 2009). The NoRH data were created by SSW func-
tion “norh tb2ﬂux”, with the option “abox = [0, 220, 80,
330]” (with the unit [arcsecs]) covering the ﬂare region. The
Fermi/GBM n0 detector was best facing the Sun during this
ﬂare and used in this study.

We also used 94 ˚A, 304 ˚A, and 1600 ˚A images of the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al. 2012)
and continuum images and line-of-sight magnetograms of the

Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al. 2012).
Both AIA and HMI are installed in the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO: Pesnell et al. 2012).

We conducted co-alignments between the data of the dif-
ferent
instruments, using images and maps taken around
23:59:08 UT. First, we aligned the intensity map at the Hα −8 ˚A
from DST to the continuum image of HMI. Second, maps in the
Ca II K −5.5 ˚A and Ca II 8542 ˚A −5.0 ˚A from DST were aligned
to the Hα map. Third, the AIA 1600 ˚A image and the IRIS Si IV
image were used for alignment between all SDO images and
IRIS data. Combining these procedures, we can ﬁnally remove
offsets between images and maps.

Fig. 4. Time series of the ﬂare region in the white box of ﬁgure 3. In each panel, the elapsed time from the start time of the ﬂare at 23:55 UT (t) is shown. The
dashed line indicates the IRIS slit location. In (a) and (b), the bright feature staying at the same slit position is indicated by the yellow arrows. The (a) cyan and
(b) orange arrows indicate the position of the moving ﬂare kernel. (Color online)

of the ﬂare. Here is the description of the ﬂare kernel on which
we focus in this paper. We deﬁne two variables t and yslit as the
elapsed time from the ﬂare onset at 23:55:00 UT and the y po-
sition along the IRIS slit in the solar coordinates, respectively.
Figure 2 shows the temporal variation of high energy emissions
around the impulsive phase (t =150–360 s), which indicates the
energy input from the corona to the lower atmosphere. The im-
pulsive phase consists of two bursts. The ﬁrst one was involved
in the NoRH 17 GHz and Fermi HXR ﬂux during t =150–200 s.
During the second burst (t =200–360 s), the time derivative of
the GOES SXR and Fermi HXR ﬂux increased. Figure 3 shows
images of the ﬂare region at the ﬂare peak time. There were
two sets of two conjugate ﬂare ribbons. Each set of them was
at the northern and southern part of the ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of
ﬁgure 3. The northern ﬂare ribbons (FR+
N) were at
two sides of the magnetic polarity inversion line of the delta-

N and FR−

S and FR−

type sunspot. The southern ﬂare ribbons (FR+
S ) were
involved in the mixed polarity region to the south of the delta-
type sunspot. The ﬂare kernel that we focus on was located in
FR−
S (on the IRIS slit (yslit ∼174′′ in ﬁgure 3(c-d))). As shown
in ﬁgure 4, the intensity of the ﬂare ribbon was weak during the
ﬁrst burst and became much higher at t ∼200 s. Note that the
increase of the NoRH 17 GHz in the ﬁrst burst (t =150–200 s in
ﬁgure 2(c)) was involved in the northern ﬂare (see ﬁgure 3(a)),
which is out of our scope. During the second burst (t =200–
360 s), the ﬂare kernel moved ∼ 9′′ northward along the slit
with an apparent speed of 31 km s−1. At t ∼360 s, the feature
stopped moving in the vicinity of the penumbra and became less
bright.

We investigated the temporal and spatial variation of dy-
namics around the ﬂare kernel by measuring three quantities
of the spectral lines: peak intensity, line width, and Doppler ve-

locity as well as ﬁrst moment velocity (intensity-weighted ve-
locity across the line). The original line proﬁles were used to
derive the quantities from the IRIS data (mostly emission pro-
ﬁles), while the DST line proﬁles (mostly absorption proﬁles)
were processed after subtracting the reference proﬁle from the
original ones. The reference proﬁles of the DST lines are the
averaged spectra of a non-ﬂaring region. The rest wavelengths
were deﬁned by the central wavelengths of averaged spectra in
non-ﬂaring regions, which are expected to have intrinsic veloc-
ity of zero or less than a few km s−1. Doppler velocity and line
width were derived by the bisector method:
the central posi-
tion and the difference of the two wavelengths in red and blue
sides of the line proﬁle at which the intensity gets 30% of the
peak, respectively. We adopted this intensity level since inten-
sity enhancement in line wings, which will be focused on in this
study, is well captured at this level (30% level was also used
by Graham & Cauzzi 2015). We derived Doppler velocity and
line width with other intensity levels (at every 1% from 20%
to 40%) and conﬁrmed that the values differ from those of the

30% level within 5 km s−1 for Doppler velocity and 30 km s−1
for line width, respectively. The instrumental width of the IRIS
FUV band (including the C II and Si IV lines) and the NUV band
(including the Mg II lines) is 25.85 m ˚A and 50.54 m ˚A, respec-
tively (De Pontieu et al. 2014), which are essentially negligible
in this study. Note that the line widths derived in this paper (the
full width at 30% maximum) are larger than those by the usual
deﬁnition (the full width at half maximum (FWHM)).

Figures 5 and 6 are the space-time plots of the peak intensity,
the Doppler velocity, and the line width along the IRIS slit lo-
cation for the IRIS and DST lines, respectively, in the range to
focus on the moving ﬂare kernel. We do not show the ﬁrst mo-
ment velocity in this paper, since they evolved similarly with,
but slightly smaller than, the Doppler velocity determined by
the bisector method in all the lines. The peak intensities of the
IRIS lines evolved similar to each other, while the brightening

Fig. 6. Same as ﬁgure 5, but for the DST lines. Three diagonal dotted lines are drawn at the same space and time as those in ﬁgure 5. The detail of the
location indicated by the horizontal dotted line (yslit =172.′′

4) is shown in ﬁgure 8. Note that the DST observation started at t = 242 s. (Color online)

in the three DST lines persisted longer than in the IRIS lines.
On the other hand, the temporal and spatial variations of line
shifts look different: only in the Mg II h line, the blueshift was
conﬁrmed. No clear blueshift was observed in other ﬁve lines.
The blueshift appeared when the ﬂare kernel started moving; the
blueshift lasted during the second burst (t =200–360 s). While
the bluesift from 171.′′0 to 176.′′2 in yslit was followed by the
redshift in the Mg II h line, the blueshift from 176.′′2 to 178.′′1
in yslit persisted and was not followed by any clear redshift. In
the DST lines, the spatial structure was extended in the spatial
direction compared to that in the IRIS lines due to the seeing
effect (∼ 2′′).

Here we focus on the evolution of the peak intensity, the
Doppler velocity, and the line width from 171.′′0 to 176.′′2 in
yslit. (The evolution from 176.′′2 to 178.′′1 in yslit is described
in the last paragraph of this section.) The temporal variations of
the three quantities at the pixels in the yslit range were similar
to each other, while redshifts continued longer in the positions
′′2 in yslit. The spatial width of the region

with the blueshift in the Mg II h line was ∼ 700 km in the travel-
ing direction. Recently Xu et al. 2016 observed the dark feature

in the He I 10830 ˚A line at the leading edge of ﬂare footpoints
before the burst phase. The spatial width of the dark feature
in their study (340–510 km) was smaller than that of the fea-
ture with blueshift in this study, but both occurred at the leading
edge of ﬂare footpoints.

With ﬁgures 7 and 8, we take a closer look at the typical
temporal variation of the three quantities at a pixel: the peak in-
′′4
tensity, the line width, and the Doppler velocity at yslit =172.
(horizontal dotted line in ﬁgure 5 and 6). At this location, the
blueshift in the Mg II h line was the largest among all the pix-
′′2 in yslit. The blueshift that was larger

than 5 km s−1 lasted for 29 s with the maximum velocity of
14 km s−1 (shown by the blue arrow in ﬁgure 7). During
this period, the intensity of the Mg II h was still small but just
started getting large. The line width became broader when the
blueshift appeared in the Mg II h line. After that, the large red-
shift in the Si IV, C II, and Mg II h lines lasted for 67 s, 29 s, and
10 s (e-folding time) with the maximum velocity of 62 km s−1,
79 km s−1, and 51 km s−1, respectively. The intensity and the
line width also increased together. The three quantities reached
their maxima almost at the same time as indicated by the red ar-

for the DST lines, when the observation started (purple arrow in
ﬁgure 8), the blueshift in the Mg II h line was almost over and all

imum velocity was 34 km s−1, 15 km s−1, and 46 km s−1 for
the Ca II K, Ca II 8542 ˚A, and Hα lines, respectively. Then, the
Doppler velocities decreased in the three lines. The line widths
varied similarly to the line shifts. The brightening in the three
DST lines peaked a little later and persisted longer than in the
IRIS lines.

′′0 to 176.

The line proﬁles at the times indicated by the three arrows
in ﬁgure 7 are shown in ﬁgure 9. From ﬁgures 7(c) and 9(g-
i), we can recognize that the blueshift in the Mg II h line was
due to the weak enhancement in the blue wing with the mod-
erate peak intensity and that the redshift was due to the strong
enhancement in the red wing with the large peak intensity. In
addition, as shown in ﬁgure 9(g), the blue-side peak (h2v) was
smaller than the red-side one (h2r). The Si IV and C II lines (ﬁg-
ure 9(a-c) and (d-f)) show strong enhancement in the red wing,
in particular at t =223 and 280 s, respectively. Note that the
proﬁle shown in ﬁgure 9(b) was saturated. Figure 10 shows the
similar plots as ﬁgure 9 but for the DST lines at the times in-
dicated by the three arrows in ﬁgure 8, with the reference and
original proﬁles. In all the DST lines at t =248 and 278 s, no
blueshift was conﬁrmed and the strong emission especially in
the red wing can be seen. These characteristics were similar in

detail of the blueshift in the Mg II lines from 171.
in yslit. In ﬁgure 11(a), black plus signs show the distribution
of the blueshift that was larger than 5 km s−1 in the location
from 171.′′0 to 178.′′1 in yslit. Each of thick plus signs among
them indicates the time of the peak blueshift at each pixel of the
location from 171.′′0 to 176.′′2 in yslit, where the blueshift pre-
ceded the redshift. Thick and thin lines in ﬁgure 11(b-c) show
the average and ﬁve examples of the Mg II h and k line proﬁles
at the positions indicated by black and colored thick plus signs
in ﬁgure 11(a), respectively. As is the case with the proﬁle in
ﬁgure 9(g), the averaged proﬁle of the Mg II h line had the en-
hanced blue wing and the small intensity of the blue-side peak
(h2v) compared to the red-side peak (h2r), which was the typi-
cal shape among the blueshifted line proﬁles. The Mg II k line
behaved similarly with the Mg II h (ﬁgure 11(b-c)) while its in-
tensity is larger and the blue wing is blended by another line.
In the Mg II h line, the mean velocity of the blueshift indicated
by the thick plus signs in ﬁgure 11(a) was 10.1 km s−1 with
the standard deviation of 2.6 km s−1. The mean duration of the
blueshift (> 5 km s−1) at one pixel location was 28 s with the
minimum and maximum duration of 9 s and 48 s, respectively.
Figure 11(d) shows an example of the temporal evolution of the

Mg II h line proﬁles at a speciﬁc location (yslit=173.
signs in ﬁgure 11(a)): the transition from the blueshifted pro-

ﬁles to the redshifted proﬁles. The strong redshift and red wing
enhancement were observed just after the moderate intensity
with the blue wing enhancement. This was the typical evolu-
′′0 to
tion of the Mg II h and k proﬁles in the location from 171.

′′2 in yslit.
As we have conﬁrmed, the intensity, the redshift, and the line
width in all the six lines had spatially and temporally good cor-
relation with each other. The moving ﬂare kernel was observed
simultaneously with the increase of Fermi hard X-ray ﬂux.
Therefore, the variation of three quantities would be involved
in the variation of energy input by electron beams (Fang et al.
′′4
1993). The maximum velocity of the redshift at yslit =172.
was 62 km s−1 (Si IV), 79 km s−1 (C II), and 51 km s−1
(Mg II h), 34 km s−1 (Ca II K), 15 km s−1 (Ca II 8542 ˚A),

5 Discussion

5.1 Observational results related to the blueshift in

the Mg II lines

We discovered the blue wing enhancement of the Mg II h and k
lines prior to the large intensity and redshift. The blueshift in
the wing amounts to 10.1 ± 2.6 km s−1 and it lasted for 9–48 s
or for 28 s in average in the Mg II h line. It is also found that
the blue-side peaks (h2v and k2v) were weaker than the red-
side ones (h2r and k2r) in the Mg II h and k lines during this
period. We discuss two scenarios for such blueshift: the cool
downﬂow scenario in the sebsection 5.2 and the cool upﬂow
scenario in the subsection 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5.
In addition, we
observed the long-lasting blueshift that was not followed by any
large redshift and intensity. Note that we could not conﬁrm any
ﬁlament-like motion around the location where the blue wing
enhancements were observed.

5.2 Discussion of the blueshift: the cool downﬂow

scenario

First, let us think about a possibility that a downward motion of
chromospheric plasma generates the blue asymmetry. Heinzel

Fig. 12. A schematic cartoon of the one-dimensional cool upﬂow scenario that we discuss in this study. The deep penetration of non-thermal electrons into
the chromosphere causes an upﬂow of the chromospheric-temperature (cool) plasma lifted up by the expanding (hot) plasma, before the strong emission in
the chromospheric lines from the downward moving condensation region. (Color online)

et al. (1994) proposed a model in which the upper chromo-
spheric layer moving downward absorbs the radiation of the
red-side peak of emission in the Hα line formed in deeper
layer thus lowering its intensity in comparison to the blue one.
Kuridze et al. (2015) calculated the chromospheric line proﬁles
and showed that the blue asymmetry can occur in the Hα line,
which is owing to the shift of maximum opacity of the overlay-
ing layer to longer wavelengths. However, in such cases, the
intensity of the red-side peak is lower than that of the blue one,
while in our observation the red-side peak was higher than the
blue-side one in the Mg II h and k lines. Hence, this scenario
cannot explain the observed feature of the Mg II h and k lines.

5.3 Discussion of the blueshift: the cool upﬂow

scenario

On the other hand, Canﬁeld et al. (1990) discussed that an up-
ward motion of chromospheric plasma can cause the blue asym-
metry when high-energy electrons rush into the deep chromo-
sphere in the early phase of the ﬂare. Although in their study
the blueshift in the Hα line occurred when the intensity level
maximized, in our observation the blueshift in the Mg II h line
lasted for 9–48 s at each pixel before the largest intensity and
redshift. We present a scenario for our observation in ﬁgure 12,
which is a cartoon of temporal variation of plasma dynamics

at a ﬂare footpoint; high-energy electrons penetrate into the
deeper layer, and the plasma is heated to orders of magnitude of
106−7 K. Then, the chromospheric cool plasma above the ex-
panded plasma is lifted up, which can be observed as blueshift
in chromospheric lines until the radiation from the condensa-
tion region become too strong. This scenario is partially im-
plied in one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of ﬂaring
loops by thick-target heating (Nagai & Emslie 1984; Allred et
al. 2005; Kennedy et al. 2015; Rubio da Costa et al. 2015b). In
Allred et al. (2005), the cool (Log T [K] = 4.5–4.7) and dense
plasma is moving upward above the hot (Log T [K] = 6.0–6.5)
plasma during the explosive phase of both moderate and strong
heating cases, while the radiation from the chromospheric con-
densation region seems to be already strong in this phase. In
Kennedy et al. (2015), the non-thermal electron beam heating
causes a region of high-density cool (Log T [K] = 4.0–4.5) ma-
terial propagating upward (∼ 100 km s−1) through the corona
during the explosive phase. Then the temperature of this mate-
rial rapidly increased because the energy input by non-thermal
electrons and thermal conduction was too large to be radiated
away. We suppose that in speciﬁc condition, ﬂare heating can
balance with radiative cooling in such cool dense plasma and
the material can survive for longer time. The blue wing en-
hancement in the Mg II h line observed in our study may be
attributed to such cool upﬂow above expanding hot plasma that

16

Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, (2014), Vol. 00, No. 0

is attributed to high energy electrons. Actually, the blueshift in
the Mg II h line occurred in the second burst with the increase of
the time derivative of the GOES SXR ﬂux and Fermi HXR ﬂux
(ﬁgure 2), which is a proxy of the energy input by high energy
electron beams.

5.4 A cloud modeling based on the cool upﬂow

scenario

To discuss our result more quantitatively in terms of the cool
upﬂow scenario, we calculated the Mg II h line proﬁle using a
cloud model (Beckers 1964; Tziotziou 2007). In this model, the
equation of radiative transfer is expressed as

I(∆λ) = I0(∆λ) e

∆λ = λ − λ0 is the difference between the wavelength λ and
the rest wavelength of the Mg II h line λ0, I(∆λ) is the ﬂare
intensity, I0(∆λ) is the background intensity, τ (∆λ) and S
are the optical thickness and averaged source function of the
cloud, respectively, τ0 is the optical thickness of the cloud at
the line center, ∆λLOS ≡ λ0VLOS/c is the shift of wavelength
corresponding to the line-of-sight velocity of the cloud VLOS
(c is the light speed), ∆λD is the Doppler width, kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, mM g is the atomic
mass of Magnesium, and Vturb is the turbulent velocity in the
In the calculation, we assume that the temperature of

the cloud is T =104 K, and for the background intensity I0(∆λ)
we use a symmetric line proﬁle made from the red-side half
of the averaged proﬁle shown in the thick line in ﬁgure 11(b).
In addition, α is deﬁned as the ratio of the source function to
the background intensity at the line center (α ≡ S/I0(∆λ = 0)).
Figure 13 shows a result of cloud model ﬁtting where the values
of free parameters are VLOS = −40 km s−1, Vturb = 40 km s−1,
τ0 = 0.5, and α = 0.6. The result produces a line proﬁle simi-
lar to the averaged proﬁle from the observation. We stress that
the observed peak difference (the blue-side peak is smaller than
the red-side peak) is attributed to the attenuation by the cloud
I0(∆λ) exp[−τ (∆λ)] and the blue wing enhancement is due to
the brightening from the cloud itself S {1 − exp [−τ (∆λ)]}. In
this point, the scenario of upward moving cool plasma is consis-
tent with our observation. In addition, the line-of-sight velocity
of the cloud VLOS in the cloud modeling is larger (40 km s−1)
than the the velocity by the bisector method in the observation
(10.1 ± 2.6 km s−1). Note that the bisector method generally
leads to smaller shifts compared to cloud model ﬁtting.

It is true that we did not perform the full non-LTE model-
ing of Mg II line proﬁles, which can be done in a next paper.
Therefore, we do not exclude other possibilities. However, the
cloud model itself represents the formal solution of the non-
LTE transfer equation assuming the simple model with constant
quantities within the moving layer. In comparison with the ob-
served proﬁles, the cloud model provides a reasonable estimate
of the ﬂow velocity and the line width, along with other two
quantities that are the line source function and the line center
optical thickness. While the emission from the moving cloud
produces the blue wing enhancement but the absorption by the
cloud causes the lowering of the blue-side peak, the detailed
non-LTE modeling will be needed to compute other quantities.
This will then require the model of temperature and density
structure. Such models have been recently produced using the
hydrodynamical code (Nakamura et al. in preparation) and pre-
liminary non-LTE modeling based on selected time snapshots
indeed leads to qualitatively the same Mg II proﬁles as observed
(P. Heinzel, private communication).

5.5 Consistency of the cool upﬂow scenario with

observational results in various lines

Next, why was the blueshift not observed in other lines, when
it appeared in the Mg II h line? Concerning the DST lines, one
possibility is that the region with the blue wing enhancement
(spatial scale ∼1′′) was not resolved by the ground-based DST
observation because of the seeing effect (∼2′′). The other possi-
bility is due to the opacity differences; if we assume the VAL-C
atmosphere (averaged quiet Sun model: Vernazza et al. 1981)
as an initial model and pay attention to the 10,700 K plasma,
then the opacity of the Mg II h line is estimated to be about 14
times larger than that of the Hα line. In addition, the opacity of
the Mg II h line is known to be larger than that of the Ca II K line
and the Ca II 8542 ˚A line (Leenaarts et al. 2013). Therefore, it
is possible that cool upﬂow is seen in the Mg II h line but not in
the Ca II K, Ca II 8542 ˚A, and Hα lines. On the other hand, the
opacity of the C II 1335 ˚A line is similar to that of the Mg II h
line (Rathore et al. 2015). Indeed, the blue-side peak was typi-
cally smaller than the red-side peak in the C II 1335 ˚A line but
no blue wing enhancement was observed in our study. This can
be interpreted in this way: the difference of the peak intensi-
ties can be understood by the same model as that of the Mg II h
line. However, the source function of the upward moving cloud
might be too small to cause blue wing enhancement in the C II
1335 ˚A. Finally, the Si IV 1403 ˚A line forms at transition re-
gion temperatures around 105 K and thus is optically thin at
104 K. The upward moving cool cloud might be transparent in
the Si IV 1403 ˚A line.

had lower intensity than those at yslit <176.′′2. That means
the energy ﬂux at yslit >176.′′2 was so small and heating was
weak, which resulted in smaller kinetic energy of downward
ﬂow. Thus, the downward velocity and downward compres-
sion would have been weak, and bright condensation downﬂow
would not be observed. On the other hand, it is reasonable that
cool upﬂow is associated with such small energy ﬂux. There
are possible interpretations for both the cases with the small en-
ergy input in the deeper and the middle or upper chromsphere.
The small energy input in the deeper chromosphere could lead
to the local heating, causing gas pressure increase to generate
a shock wave, which drives the cool upﬂow when it crosses the
transition layer (Osterbrock 1961; Suematsu et al. 1982). In this
case, the transition region moves upward, which results in cool
upﬂow without any expanding hot plasma. If the small energy
input is given in the middle or upper chromosphere to increase
the gas pressure to a few times of the initial value, then the
gas pressure gradient force accelerates the cool plasma upward
(Shibata et al. 1982). Also in this case, the cool upﬂow is not
associated with any expanding hot plasma.

5.7 Summary and future work

We performed coordinated observations of NOAA AR 12205,
which produced the C-class ﬂare on 2014 November 11, with
the IRIS and the DST at Hida Observatory. Using spectral data
in the Si IV 1403 ˚A, C II 1335 ˚A, and Mg II h and k lines from
IRIS and the Ca II K, Ca II 8542 ˚A, and Hα lines from DST, we
investigated the temporal and spatial evolution around the ﬂare
kernel during the ﬂare. The ﬂare kernel apparently moved along
the IRIS slit. In the Mg II h line, the leading edge of the ﬂare ker-
nel showed intensity enhancement in the blue wing, and small
intensity of the blue-side peak (h2v) compared to the red-side
one (h2r). Then, the drastic change of the intensity in the red
wing occurred. The blueshift lasted for 9–48 s with a typical
speed of 10.1 ± 2.6 km s−1 and it was followed by strong red-
shift with a speed of up to 51 km s−1 detected in the Mg II h line.
The strong redshift was a common property for all six spectral
lines used in this study but the blueshift prior to it was found
only in the Mg II lines. A cloud modeling of the Mg II h line
suggests that the blue wing enhancement with such peak differ-
ence can be caused by a chromospheric-temperature (cool) up-
ﬂow. We discuss a scenario in which an upﬂow of cool plasma
is lifted up by expanding (hot) plasma owing to the deep pene-

tration of non-thermal electrons into the chromosphere. In addi-
tion, the long-lasting blueshift was also observed in the Mg II h
line, which was not followed by any large redshift and intensity
enhancement. This occurred at the northern leading edge of the
ﬂare kernel in its decaying phase. Such long-lasting blueshift
can be explained by cool upﬂow caused by so small energy ﬂux
into the lower atmosphere that expanding hot upﬂow is not pro-
duced.

The chromospheric lines used in this study are formed under
the non-LTE condition. The observed line proﬁle is inﬂuenced
by the three-dimensional radiative ﬁeld depending on the tem-
perature and density structure. In the case of no velocity ﬁeld,
the intensities in the line core and wings reﬂect the information
about the higher and lower levels of the atmosphere, respec-
tively, since the absorption coefﬁcient has its maximum in the
line core and is smaller in the wings. In addition, there are large
velocity gradients during solar ﬂares. Therefore, it is not so sim-
ple to diagnose the velocity ﬁeld at a certain height from spectral
line proﬁles. Modeling of the ﬂaring atmosphere and synthesiz-
ing chromospheric line proﬁles has been conducted so far (e.g.,
Nagai & Emslie 1984; Allred et al. 2005; Rubio da Costa et
al. 2015a, 2015b, 2016, Rubio da Costa & Kleint 2017). Our
result about the blueshift in the Mg II lines will restrict the fur-
ther modeling. There would be both cases of ﬂaring regions
with and without a signature of blueshift in the chromospheric
lines. Even at a single location, the chromospheric response to
ﬂares differs for different observing lines. The initial condition
and energy input may affect the evolution of cool upﬂow sig-
niﬁcantly and the spectra would also change sensitively by the
surrounding environment. More studies are needed in the fu-
ture to clarify what causes these differences and to understand
the heating mechanism of the ﬂaring chromosphere from the
spectroscopic observations.
