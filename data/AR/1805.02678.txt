ABSTRACT
On 2017 September 10 Neutron Monitors (NMs) apparatus located at ground level and high latitudes
detected an increase in the counting rate associated to solar energetic particles (SEPs) emission from
X8.2-class solar ﬂare and its associated CME. This was the second-highest ﬂare of the current solar
cycle. The origin was the active region AR 12673 when it was located at the edge of the west solar disk,
magnetically poorly connected with Earth. However, there was a peculiar condition: the solar protons
accelerated by the CME shocks were injected within a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) region when
Earth was crossing this region. We show that often HCS and SEPs propagation are closely related. If
the source locations of SEPs are within or close to HCS, the HCS play the role of a Sun−Earth magnetic
connection. SEPs drift around HCS paths, and SEPs are also drift in a wide range of longitudes by the
HCSs. In some cases, and especially when Earth crosses the HCS sector, a fraction of these particles
can reach Earth with a harder energetic particle ﬂux, triggering a ground-level enhancement (GLE).
The blast on 2017 September 10, which triggered the GLE #72, was the second in the current solar
cycle. We show that the two GLEs, including all sub-GLEs observed in the current solar cycle, comes
from solar explosions that happened within an HCS structure; this behavior is also observed in the
GLEs of the previous solar cycle. In general, solar explosions from active regions poorly connected
with Earth can trigger GLEs, through the mechanism described above. In all cases, the SEPs drift
processes by HCS structures provides an eﬃcient particle transport, allowing the observation of these
solar transient events.

INTRODUCTION
Ground-level enhancements (GLEs), typically in the MeVGeV energy range, are sudden increases in cosmic ray in-
tensities registered by neutron monitors (NMs), which are ground-based instruments that detect a variety of secondary
particles, mainly neutrons produced by primary protons penetrating the Earths atmosphere (Miroshnichenko et al,
2008; Gopalswamy et al., 2010). These enhancements can be registered by other types of ground-based detectors,
such as air shower detectors and muon telescopes (L3 Collaboration 2008; Wang, 2009; Nitta etal., 2012). In most
cases, GLEs occur during the intense X-class solar ﬂares2 as well as the fast (above ∼ 1000 km s−1) Coronal Mass
(2012)). However, there are also some cases of
Ejections (CMEs; Gopalswamy et al.,
GLEs associated with weaker ﬂares and slower CMEs when preceded by other events that provides seed particles that
increase the eﬃciency of particle acceleration (Cliver, 2006).

(2010); Gopalswamy at al.,

In general, the production of a GLE need harder energetic particle ﬂuxes having strong ﬂuences, above the back-
ground ﬂuence due to galactic cosmic rays. Statistical analysis has shown that a conjunction between CME-driven
interplanetary shock and ﬂare are likely to be the cause of GLEs, but CMEs alone presumably does not cause GLEs
(Firoz et al., 2010).

2 Flares are classiﬁed into 5 major classes, X, M, C, B, and A, with X corresponding to the Geostationary Operations Environmental
Satellite (GOES) energy ﬂux (in the energy band 100-800 pm) in excess of 104 W atts m−2 at Earth and successive classiﬁcations decrease
over decades (Fletcher et al., 2011).

On the other hand, a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) is a transition zone that separates regions of opposing
interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld polarity (Wilcox & Ness, 1965). A minor geomagnetic activity is often observed when
Earth crosses through a fold in the heliospheric current sheet, a vast undulating system of electrical currents shaped
like the skirt of a ballerina. The Earth dips in and out of it all the time. These crossings are called “solar sector
boundary crossings”, and they occasionally trigger high-latitude auroras.

Galactic cosmic rays are also modulated by the HCS (Burger & Potgieter, 1989; Alanko-Huatori et al., 2007),
particularly the eﬀect of drift on the transport of cosmic rays due to an HCS that has been obtained by Jokipii (Jokipii
& Thomas, 1981). Drift eﬀects are dependent on particle energy and on the Interplanetary Field (IMF) conﬁguration.
The deceleration of particles (protons) by drift processes on the A > 0 conﬁgurations of the IMF retains a signiﬁcant
portion of their energies because, under this condition, the latitudinal drift is constraining. Galactic cosmic rays
inferred from neutron monitors often show a small peak in the counting rate preceding the HCS crossing, followed by
a drop after the crossing (Thomas et al., 2014). Also, often an HCS structure has an inﬂuence on the propagation of
a high-speed stream (Augusto et al., 2017).

In addition, the eﬀects of the HCS on the propagation properties of solar disturbances, such as the SEPs, depends on
the source location in relation to HCS (Henning et al., 1985; Wei & Dryer, 1991; Xie et al., 2006). The modulation
of SEP also depends on the magnetic conﬁguration (A > 0 or A < 0) of the IMF. SEPs near an HCS drift across a
wider range of longitudes in the A > 0 conﬁguration, and drift across latitudes in the A < 0 conﬁguration (Battarbee
et al., 2018).

In this paper, we show that the signals detected by spacecraft detectors on 2017 September 10 correspond to two
diﬀerent phases of the solar ﬂare. The energy release, during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, was observed as an
increase of gamma rays and hard X-rays registered by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) and Fermi GBM. The GOES observed soft X-ray signals corresponding to gradual (or extended) phase of
the ﬂare. Solar protons observed by GOES were accelerated by CME shock waves with an average speed of 948 km/s,
triggering a radiation storm of up to S3 (strong) level in the NOAA storm scale. A conjunction between CME-driven
interplanetary shocks and an X8.2-class ﬂare triggered the GLE #72 detected by neutron monitors located at high
latitudes. Some characteristics of the GLE #72 can be found in (Kurt et al, 2018) and the kinematics of the blast on
2017 September 10 and the spectral characteristics of the associated energetic particles were reported in (Gopalswamy
et al., 2018).

However, as the blast happened in the western edge of the solar disk, i. e., a non-geoeﬀective region because it is
longitudinally separated by more than 90 degrees from Earth, the energetic particles (protons and ions) ejected needed
to be drifted longitudinally in order to reach Earth. In the present case, this mechanism was enhanced, because protons
were injected within an HCS, and under the A > 0 conﬁguration of the IMF (2017 September), besides particles drift
across the HCS path, they also drift in a wide range of longitudes. Thus, the HCS modulation has played the role of
a Sun−Earth magnetic connection to obtain a harder energetic particle ﬂux at Earth, triggering the GLE #72.

These observations are reported, including a brief description of all activity of sunspot AR 12673 in 2017 September,
the origin of relativistic particle levels on 2017 September 10, the connection between ﬂare, CME, and SEPs, including
the GLE #72. In the Appendix, where we present ﬁve solar blasts that happened at the western edge of the solar limb,
three of them the active region; at the time of the blast, it was no longer seen from Earth. Even so, in all cases, SEPs
were observed, triggering GLEs or at least sub-GLEs. We also show two cases where the SEPs and HCS structures
are correlated, even in events magnetically better connected to Earth. In all cases, the blasts occurred within an HCS
structure. This means that SEPs propagation and HCS are closely related.

2. ACTIVITY OF SUNSPOT AR 12673 IN 2017 SEPTEMBER
The active region AR 12673 began to be visible on August 26, and during its rotation toward the sun’s western
limb, AR 12673 had a “beta-gamma-delta” magnetic conﬁguration, producing strong eruption on the Sun. Indeed,
AR 12673 erupted 25 M-Flares and 3 X-Flares, including the two largest of the current solar cycle (Cycle 24). Figure 1
is a photograph of AR 12673 made by Maximilian Teodorescu of Magurele, Romania3, on 2017 September 8, i.e., two
days after of the strongest eruption in the current solar cycle an X9.2-class ﬂare, on 2017 September 6.

Two X-class solar ﬂares erupted on 2017 September 6 from AR 12673. The ﬁrst was a long-duration X2.2-class ﬂare
at 9:33 UT. The blast was associated with a narrow CME ejected on the western region of the solar disk. However,
the average shock wave speed was only 419 km s−1 and they were also injected mainly “below” of the ecliptic plane.
This ﬂare was the ﬁrst X-class since 2015 May 5. The second was at 12:02 UT, and was also the strongest eruption in
the current solar cycle, reaching the condition of X9.2-class ﬂare.

The blast was associated with a full-halo CME (CME #0017, in the Cactus quicklook CME catalog), the lowest and
highest shock velocities detected within the CME was 376 km s−1 and 1955 km s−1, respectively, with a median value
of 978 km s−1. The CME #0017 was classiﬁed as halo IV because its angular width was above 270◦ and reached the
value of 360◦.

The presence of Type IV and Type II radio emissions associated with the blast means a strong coronal mass ejection
was associated with solar radiation storms. After a travel of 35 h, the halo CME arrived at Earth on 2017 September
7 at ∼23:00 UT, triggering a strong G3 geomagnetic storm. This was the second strongest geomagnetic storm in the
current solar cycle. The Dst geomagnetic index reached up to -142 nT in the transition from 2017 September 7-8; the
top panel of Figure 2 summarizes the situation.

magnetic conﬁguration. The AR 12673 region size was more than ten times the size of Earth. Reproduced with permission. c(cid:13)Maximilian
Teodorescu 2017.6

In addition, the strong geomagnetic storm triggered a Forbush decrease (FD). An FD is a transient decrease followed
by a gradual recovery in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity. The perturbed geomagnetic ﬁeld during geomagnetic
storms disperses the cosmic rays in the vicinity of the Earth, producing a fall in the counting rate at ground-level
detectors. The FD intensity increases as the geomagnetic rigidity cutoﬀ of the site of the detector decreases. Thus,
the FDs are more intense in detectors located at high latitudes. The FD associated with G3 geomagnetic reached an
intensity variation of up to 11% at South Pole NM. The bottom panel of Figure 2 summarizes the situation.

On 2017 September 10, AR 12673 erupted when it was in the extreme western limb. It was the second strongest
ﬂare of the cycle 24, reaching up to X8.2-class, associated to a halo IV CME. A fraction of the shocks within the
CME was ejected within an HCS region and when Earth was crossing the HCS region. The HCS allowed a direct
magnetic (Sun−Earth) connection, because of the solar energetic particles, accelerated by the CME shocks started
arriving on Earth, up to reaching the S3 (strong) condition in the NOAA storm scale, triggering the second ground-
level enhancement (GLE #72) in the current solar cycle detected in some NMs, as shown in bottom panel in Figure 2.
These observations are detailed in the next section.

3. ORIGIN OF RELATIVISTIC PROTON LEVELS AND THE GLE #72
On 2017 September 10, almost out of view from our fair planet, rotating around the Sun’s western edge, the active
region AR 12673 erupted again at 15:35 UT, the blast was an X8.2-class ﬂare. An image in the extreme ultraviolet
region was caught by Solar Dynamics Observatory and it is shown on the left panel of Fig. 3. The blast had its

associated CME (CME #0037 in the LASCO quicklook CME catalog) and whose image captured by the Lasco on the
SOHO spacecraft is shown on the right panel of Fig. 3. This CME had a signiﬁcant release of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld
from the solar corona, it was classiﬁed as halo IV and reaching the value of 360 degrees (full halo). The angular width
derived from projected images is only an apparent quantity, it indicates the angular size of the CME volume projected
onto the plane of the sky. A CME appears as a halo IV only if it is launched on a path close to the Sun−Earth direction
and this happened only when the active solar region is near to the solar central region. But this is not the case for
the CME #0037, the active region that originated the blast was at the western edge. This eﬀect it can be explained
considering the reduction of the heliospheric pressure in the solar cycle 24 in relation to the previous (cycle 23), this
can propitiate an anomalous expansion of coronal mass ejections near the Sun (Gopalswamy et al., 2015). However,
in this case, can be also associated, at least in part, to the location of the active region, within an HCS. Under this
condition, the magnetic pressure of the environment region during the expansion of the CME is non-existent, because
of the HCS is a transition region between two magnetic polarities, where B ∼ 0.

the X8.2-class ﬂare at 16:48 UT. It was a halo IV CME, reaching an angular width of 360◦ (full halo) at 16:48 UT. (Credit: Cactus analysis
from LASCO detector).

The data is from LASCO coronagraph images and automatically generated by CACTus (Robbrecht et al., 2009).
The pa CACTus parameter correlated with the CME projected latitude, and it is deﬁned as the middle angle of the
CME when seen in the white-light images. The pa parameter also depends on the orientation of the CME in the
relation of the observer (Lagrange Point L1). The principal angle is measured counterclockwise from North (degrees).
Thus, the projected latitudes are only a good estimation of the true direction of propagation. Values of the pa close
to 90 and 270 degrees represent zero latitudes. The pa = 90◦ and pa = 270◦ coincides with the eastern side and with
the western side of the ecliptic plane, respectively (Augusto et al., 2018). In addition, from Figure 4 we can see that
the shock wave velocities in the CME #0037 ranging from 104 to 2013 km s−1, with a median velocity of 948 km s−1
and they have an almost uniform distribution, across the pa region (this happens only for a full-halo CME).

However, there was another important factor, a signiﬁcant fraction of the CME was ejected within an HCS region.
Figure 5, shows a snapshot of the WSA-Enlil model4 run around on 10 September. The model shows the solar wind
plasma density in the ecliptic plane. Blue colors show very high plasma density and grey color represents low density.
The Earth is marked as the red circle, and the Sun is shown by the blue circle. Following this ﬁgure, we can see that
on 10 September the Earth was crossing a wide region of high solar plasma density, i.e., crossing the HCS. The crossing
of Earth, through the boundary sectors of HCS, is usually not associated with big disturbances in the geomagnetic
ﬁeld, but there is a signature on the solar wind parameters. In the present case, a sector boundary crossing (SBC)
occurred in 2017 September 6 (DOY 249), when the magnetic ﬁeld changed from “away” to “towards” Sun, and ∼
8 days later (at transition from 13 to 14 September, DOY 256-257) back to “away”, as shown in the time proﬁles of
Phi angle in the top panel of Figure 6, there are also changes (ﬂuctuations) in the solar wind density and speed, as
shown in the central and bottom panel of Figure 6, respectively. Data were taken from ACE. Particularly, Phi is the
angle of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld that is being carried out by the solar wind. Phi is measured in the GSM
(geocentric solar magnetospheric) coordinate system. Phi would be 0 degree if it were pointing to the Sun and 180
degrees if it were pointing from the Sun to the Earth. Sudden and rapid changes in the Phi angle happen when the
Earth is crossing an HCS sector. This property is used to limit the sector boundary crossing (SBC).

On the other hand, three dimensional Monte Carlo simulations on the propagation of solar energetic protons with
energies from 1 to 800 MeV (Battarbee et al., 2017, 2018), has shown that the HCS has a big inﬂuence on the SEPs

transport in the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld close to the ecliptic plane.

The results show that the presence of an HCS near high-energy particles play an important role in the longitudinal
and latitudinal transport of SEPs, allowing it to drift over 180 degrees in longitude, i.e., protons can reach regions
far from the injection longitude. Under the A > 0 condition of the IMF, protons are drifted preferentially to eastern
regions, whereas under the A < 0 condition, protons are drifted preferentially to western regions. However, in both
cases, a fraction of protons are conﬁned in the vicinity of the HCS. The study considered only the magnetic conﬁguration
at the solar minimum when the Sun polarity is well deﬁned and consider only small injection regions.

However, there are at least two diﬀerent conditions in the event of 2017 September 10, when compared with the
simulated results. The ﬁrst, is that the event happened during the declining phase of the current solar cycle, even
so, close to the solar minimum. The second and more important is relative to the injection region of particles, in
the event on 2017 September 10, particles were accelerated mainly by shock waves of a full-halo CME, due to an
anomalous CME expansion, this means an extensive region when compared with the small injection region considered
in the simulation.

Thus, if particles (protons) are injected within an HCS region and when the Earth is crossing by this region, the
counting rate in the time proﬁles of detectors at Earth can be signiﬁcantly increased. We believe that this mechanism
happened on 2017 September 10, due to the X8.2-class ﬂare and its associated CME ejected at the west solar edge
and within an HCS, as are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 5.

Under a good magnetic connection and what happens when the active region which gave rise to the blast is at west,
but not far from the Sun central region, solar energetic particles in the MeV to GeV energy region can bridge the
Sun−Earth distance in a time as ∼ 10 − 20 minutes. However, the delay between the blast beginning and the onset of
proton ﬂux increase observed by the GOES on 2017 September 10 was ∼ 56 minutes (see next section). A fraction of
this delay time can be attributed to drift processes.

4. CONNECTION FLARE CME AND GLE
The observation by the Skylab around 40 years ago, of X-ray emissions by solar ﬂares at the edge of the solar limb
has enabled the clear identiﬁcation up to three phases in a solar ﬂares (Pallavicini et al., 1977), a precursor phase,
an impulsive phase (prompt) and a gradual phase (delayed). However in most cases, only the two last phases are
identiﬁed, the impulsive and the gradual according to the their X-ray duration (Ruﬀolo, 1997). From the analysis
of the timing of the diverse populations in large events, is possible to identify these two types, in the same explosion.
They are known as diﬀerent phases of a solar ﬂare (Lin et al., 2002, 2003).

In some ﬂares, the timing of electromagnetic emissions and relativistic protons suggests that the ﬁrst proton peak is
related to the acceleration during the impulsive phase (Murphy et al., 1987; Klein et al., 2014). Protons and heavier
ions are accelerated in the impulsive phase to relativistic energies by small-scale coronal loops. The impulsive phase is
characterized by a fast rise and shorter decay times, with duration of some tens of minutes (Pallavicini et al., 1977).
A fraction of these high-energy particles can interact with the nuclei of the diﬀerent elements in the ambient solar
atmosphere, these interactions can produce neutral pions which decay immediately and generate a broad gamma-ray
line with a maximum near 70 MeV (Kurt et al., 2013). There is also the emission of hard X-rays in this phase, due
to bremsstrahlung, produced by electrons that have been accelerated to much higher energies than those found in the
ambient plasma (Lin et al., 2003). The hard X-rays and the gamma-rays emissions are the evidence of acceleration
of electrons and protons (ions) to relativistic energies in this impulsive phase.

In general, the peak of the impulsive phase coincides with the rise time of the soft X-rays due to the CME expansion

and indicates the gradual phase of the solar ﬂare. Protons and ions are accelerated at this gradual phase by CME
shocks. Thus, these particles (SEPs) are spread over a broad region in solar longitude and under some (geoeﬀective)
conditions of the active area, or if it to be inside or close to an HCS structure, the most energetic particles can give
rise to a GLE (Chupp et al., 2009).

The relativistic particles emission in the large particle event on 2017 September 10, is also likely to be interpreted

in two diﬀerent phases, an impulsive (prompt) and a gradual (delayed) particle acceleration.

Signatures of the impulsive phase were seen by RHESSI (Lin et al., 2002) in hard X-ray and gamma-ray emissions

up to 20 MeV. The onset time of the RHESSI signal is estimated by as 15:50 UT, with a peak at 15:57 UT5.

A comparison between the hard X-ray emission during the impulsive phase as observed by Fermi GBM and the soft
X-ray emission during the gradual phase as observed by GOES 15 is shown in Figure 7. From this ﬁgure, we can see
that the hard X-ray emission, peaked about 10 minutes before then the soft X-ray peak.

In most cases, a type II and IV radio emissions are observed in the gradual phase at the high corona (Gopalswamy

et al., 2007) and they are typically associated with strong coronal mass ejections and solar radiation storms. In fact,
in the event around Sunspot AR 12673 on 10 September, there were type II radio emissions, with onset at 16:08 UT,
indicating that the coronal mass ejection was associated with the X8.2-class observed in the soft X-ray emission by
GOES 13, as shown in Figure 8 (top panel).

The blast generated a strong S3 Level Solar Radiation Storm (a proton ﬂux at 1AU above 1000 particles per cm2
per second and energies above 10 MeV), as observed by the GOES satellite. Figure 8 (central panel) summarizes the
situation, showing the GOES proton ﬂux for ﬁve diﬀerent energy band, from 5 MeV to 100 MeV. We can see a fast
rise increase in relativistic proton levels and after 3 hours of the onset (16:10 UT), the solar radiation storm reaches
the S3 level (strong level) in the NOAA storm radiation scale.

Correlated with this observations we have the signature of the GLE #72 (Fig. 8 (bottom panel)), in the time proﬁles
in the counting rate of three neutron monitors: South Pole (0.1 GV)(conﬁdence 5.6%), Oulu (0.8 GV)(conﬁdence
3.5%, and Lomnicky (LMKS) (3.8GV) (conﬁdence 0.7%). As expected, neutron monitors in places with high magnetic
rigidity cutoﬀ, for instance, the Athens NM (8.5 GV) did not detect any signal (see Figure 2).

5. CONCLUSIONS
On 2017 September 10, an X8.2-class solar ﬂare erupted from the active region AR 12673. This was the second
strongest solar ﬂare of the current solar cycle. Besides, the blast happened under three circumstances, the ﬁrst was the
location of the AR 12673, on the western edge of the solar disk, without a magnetic connection with the Earth. The
second is the AR 12673 footprint, within an HCS region and the third was a temporal coincidence, the blast happened
when the Earth was crossing by this HCS region.

The 2017 September 10 event, here analyzed, reinforce the hypothesis that SEPs propagation is closely related with
the HCS structures. Active regions at the solar limb have a poor magnetic connection with Earth, but, if the blasts
are within an HCS structure, SEPs from these blasts, can reach Earth and triggered GLEs.

This means that the HCS structure plays the role of a Sun−Earth magnetic connection. We present in the Appendix
four GLEs (2001 April 18, 2014 January 6, 2012 May 17 and 2014 November 1) whose origins were at the western
edge of solar limbo and in all cases, the blasts happened within an HCS structure and when the Earth was crossing
an HCS structure (except the event on 2014 January 6).

The same mechanism can be seen in the event on 29 October 2015 (Augusto el al., 2016), SEPs triggered a sub-GLE

when the Earth was crossing through a fold of the heliospheric current sheet. In short, the two GLEs and all sub-GLEs,
so far, that happen in the current solar cycle have this behavior, i.e., an HCS structure as a Sun−Earth magnetic
connection.

Also, besides the event on 2001 April 18, that happened in the previous solar cycle, we show also two GLEs #68
and #69 in January 2005, they were detected when the Earth was crossing by an HCS structure. Both were originated
from the same active region when it was within an HCS structure at the western region of the solar disk, but not at
the edge of the solar disk. This means that even the SEPs from solar active areas, better connected to Earth, the HCS
structures play a role of an eﬃcient magnetic connection.

From a timing analysis, we found that the signals detected from this blast on 2017 September 10, correspond to
diﬀerent phases of the solar ﬂare. The energy release, during the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, was observed as an
increase of gamma rays and hard X-rays, registered by RHESSI and Fermi GBM and peaking at ∼ 15:57 UT. While
the energy release in the gradual phase of the ﬂare was observed as an increase of soft X-rays registered by GOES
and peaking at 16:06 UT. The GOES proton ﬂux also corresponds to energy release in the gradual phase of the ﬂare.
Solar protons were accelerates by shock waves with a median speed of 948 km s−1, reaching a radiation storm of up
to S3 (strong) level. In addition, the ground-based detectors located in high latitudes observed a GLE (the GLE#72)
with a conﬁdence of up to 5.6%, in temporal correlation with the GOES proton ﬂux.

Finally, some peculiarities of the active region AR 12673 were reported, such as the eruption on 6 September, an
X9.3-class ﬂare, the strongest ﬂare of the current cycle. It was associated with a halo CME toward Earth, triggering
the second major geomagnetic storms of the current solar cycle (so far) on 7 September.

APPENDIX A.
In this appendix, we show seven solar ﬂares associated with CMEs that triggered GLEs, ﬁve of them happened on
the western edge of the solar disk, and in three of them, the source of the events, i.e., the active region, already had
turned to another side of the Sun and it was no longer visible from Earth.

We highlight that in all cases, the solar active regions at the time of the explosions, were within an HCS structure and
in six cases, the blast happened when the Earth was crossing this region. These events have very similar characteristics
to the event on 2017 September 10 here analyzed.

These ﬂares and their associated CMEs produced SEPs with harder energetic particle ﬂux, triggering ﬁve GLEs
(four of them in the previous solar cycle) and two sub-GLEs. Thus, the structure HCS is able to favor an eﬃcient

A.1 EVENTS ON 2001 APRIL 15 AND 18
The most spectacular solar blast from active region AR 19415 was on 2001 April 18 because, despite to be located

behind the solar western limb at 02:54 UT, emerged a full-halo CME.

The CME is the 0098 in the CACTus catalog, with shock wave velocities from 359 to 1953 km s−1 and a median
value of 1116 km s−1, as shown in Figure 9 (left top and right top panel). This behavior is hard to understand. How
an occulted region can generate a full halo CME. In addition, it also diﬃcult to understand how a poorly connected
region can be the origin of SEPs triggering a GLE, the GLE #61.

In 2001, the WSA-Enlil model of the heliosphere, that predict the solar wind structure was not available yet.
However, from the solar wind parameters obtained from ACE spacecraft at L1, is possible to see that at time blast, on

2001 April 18 (DOY 108), the Earth was crossing a wide HCS region (yellow region, in Figure 9 (left bottom panel)).
Because the HCS region was very wide, the active region also was within the HCS structure. This means, that the
CME expansion was in a region where the environment magnetic ﬁeld is close to zero, this propitiated an anomalous
expansion of coronal mass ejections, it was a full halo CME as seen from Earth. In addition, the SEPs from the blast
were drifted around the HCS path, reaching Earth and triggering the GLE #61, as shown in Figure 9 (right bottom
panel).

We would like to point out, that three days before, on 15 April 2001 (DOY 105), the AR 19415 already had blasted
SEPs from this explosion triggered the GLE #60. This happened when AR 19415 already was within the HCS region
(see Figure 9 (left bottom panel)).

APPENDIX B.
EVENT ON 2014 JANUARY 6
On 2014 January 6 at aproximately 07:50 UT the GOES satellite detected a soft X-ray emission, was a C2-class
ﬂare from a solar eruptions located behind western solar limb, i.e., the source of the ﬂare, the active region AR 11936
could no longer be seen from Earth. The tip from ﬂare were also seen by SDO/AIA as a ﬁlament. For this ﬂare the
STEREO observations indicates that the ﬂare would be a X3.5-class at 08:00 UT.

The ﬂare had its associated CME, registered by LASCO as the CME 0028 in the CACTus catalog, with a width of

188 degrees and shock waves with velocities from 123 to 1736 km s−1 with a median value of 961 km s−1, as shown in
the Figure 10 (right top panel).

As in the previous case, the source (AR 11936) at time of the blast was within an HCS structure, as shown in
Figure 10 (left top panel) where the predicted plasma density of solar wind structure is show according to WSA-Enlil
model, the black arrow indicate the CME direction emission.

However, at the time of the blast the Earth already had crossing the HCS, see Figure 10 (left bottom panel), where
the time series of solar wind parameters is presented. Even so, the HCS played the role of a Sun−Earth magnetic
connection, because the SEPs were drifted in a wide region of latitudes, following the HCS structure. Thus SEPs began
to reach the Earth at 08:00 UT, triggering an S1-class solar radiation storm, as shown in Figure 10 (right bottom
panel). The SEPs triggered a sub-GLE detected by several neutron monitors, those with a low geomagnetic rigidity
cutoﬀ, i.e., located at high latitude (polar regions), as shown in Figure 10 (right bottom panel).

An analysis of this event is presented in (Thakur et al., 2014).

B.1. EVENT ON 2014 NOVEMBER 1
The solar active region AR 12192 was the biggest sunspot, so far, of the current solar cycle, and on 2014 November 1
it was no longer visible from Earth. However, even under this condition, a soft X-ray emission was detected by GOES
satellite from AR 12192 at 9:20 UT, probably was an X-class ﬂare, while from Earth was observed only as a C4.5-class.

Another important factor is shown by the images obtained through the Lasco-c2 equipment. The CACTus catalog
reveals that the CME 0003 (associated with this blast) was a narrow CME, with an angular width of only 14 degrees,
even so, with shock waves on the western side of the ecliptic plane, as show in the Figure 11 (right panel), we can see
that the velocity of the shocks produced during the CME ejection reached ∼ 2000 km s−1.

The combination of the shock waves capable of accelerating particles in the range of up to GeV, with the structure
HCS that is able to favor the transport of these relativistic particles to the neighboring of the Earth. Showing that
AR 12192 eruption is the source of the SEPs, reaching near an S1-level radiation storm on November 1, as shown
in Figure 11 (left bottom panel). The SEPs have triggered a sub-GLE observed by neutron monitors with a low
geomagnetic rigidity cutoﬀ, i.e., those located at high latitudes (polar regions), as shown in Figure 11 (right bottom
panel).

B.2. EVENT ON 2012 MAY 17
On 2012 May 17 at 01:25 UT, an M5.1-class ﬂare exploded in the edge of the western solar limb. A CME was also
associated with this ﬂare. About 20 minutes after the soft X-ray emission, solar particles reached the Earth, there was
a proton ﬂux with energies above 100 MeV, leading to an S2 solar radiation storm level.

This explosion was the source of the ﬁrst GLE (GLE #71) since 2006 December and the ﬁrst of the current solar
cycle 24. The GLE was detected by neutron monitors (NM) and other ground-based detectors. Analysis of the GLE
#71 on 2012 May 17 using data from the global neutron monitor network is presented in Mishev et al.,
(2014);
Gopalswamy et al., (2013).

Fig. 12.— Left panel: the extreme UV ﬂash, of the solar ﬂare reaching M5.1-class, on 2012 May 17 at 01:25 UT (Credit: Solar Dynamics
Observatory). Right panel: the phi angle time proﬁles for seven consecutive days. The yellow area indicates the Earth-crossing time by
the HCS, the sectors boundary crossing is indicated as SBC. The vertical arrow indicate the onset time of GLE #71.

We would like to highlight that this event also reinforces the hypothesis that SEPs and HCS structures are closely
related. The explosion (a medium sized one) from an active region even with a poor connection with the Earth
triggered a GLE. We believe that this occurrence was possible due to the presence of an HCS structure, as shown in
Figure 12 (right panel), where the time proﬁles of phi angle is shown, there is a clear demarcation of time when Earth
is crossing by the HCS structure (yellow area). In short, the HCS plays the role of a magnetic connection.

B.3. EVENTS ON 2005 JANUARY
On 2005 January 17, a giant sunspot 720 has unleashed another big solar ﬂare. The X3-class explosion hurled a
CME directed to the Earth. Protons accelerated up to relativistic energies by the blast, hit the Earth and triggering
the GLE #68.

After around three days, the giant sunspot 720 erupted again on 2005 January 20, unleashing a powerful X7-class
solar ﬂare. The blast hurled a coronal mass ejection (CME) into space and sparked the strongest radiation storm since
October 1989, triggering the GLE #69.

We would like to highlight again, that these two events also reinforce the hypothesis that SEPs and HCS structures
are closely related. Despite in both cases, the active region that generated these two explosions had a better connection
with the Earth, also in both cases, the GLEs were detected when the Earth was crossing by the HCS sector. Due to
the large width of the HCS sector, the two explosions happened within the HCS structure, as shown in Figure 13,
where the time proﬁle of phi angle is shown, as in the previous case, there is a clear demarcation of time when Earth
is crossing by the HCS structure (yellow area).
