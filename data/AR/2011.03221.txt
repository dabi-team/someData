ABSTRACT

We present an atmospheric characterization study of two medium sized planets bracketing the radius of Neptune:
HD 106315 c (RP=4.98 ± 0.23 R⊕) and HD 3167 c (RP=2.740+0.106
−0.100 R⊕). We analyse spatially scanned spectroscopic
observations obtained with the G141 grism (1.125 - 1.650 µm) of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) onboard the
Hubble Space Telescope. We use the publicly available Iraclis pipeline and TauREx3 atmospheric retrieval code
and we detect water vapor in the atmosphere of both planets with an abundance of log10[H2O] = −2.1+0.7
−1.3 (∼5.68σ)
and log10[H2O] = −4.1+0.9
−0.9 (∼3.17σ) for HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c, respectively. The transmission spectrum of
HD 106315 c shows also a possible evidence of ammonia absorption (log10[NH3] = −4.3+0.7
−2.0, ∼1.97σ -even if it is not
signiﬁcant-), whilst carbon dioxide absorption features may be present in the atmosphere of HD 3167 c in the ∼1.1-
1.6 µm wavelength range (log10[CO2] = −2.4+0.7
−1.0, ∼3.28σ). However the CO2 detection appears signiﬁcant, it must
be considered carefully and put into perspective. Indeed, CO2 presence is not explained by 1D equilibrium chemistry
models, and it could be due to possible systematics. The additional contribution of clouds, CO and CH4 are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

High precision photometry with the NASA’s Kepler
space mission revealed the existence of a large popula-
tion of transiting planets with radii between those of
the Earth and Neptune, and with period shorter than
100 days (e.g. Borucki et al. 2011; Batalha et al. 2013;
Howard et al. 2012; Fressin et al. 2013; Dressing & Char-
bonneau 2013; Petigura et al. 2013). Thanks to more
precise measurements of the stellar radii of the Kepler
ﬁeld, ﬁrst via spectroscopy (Petigura et al. 2017; Ful-
ton et al. 2017) and then via Gaia Data Release 2 data
(Fulton & Petigura 2018), it was then discovered that
the radius distribution of small planets is bimodal with
a paucity of planets with radii in the range of 1.5-2 R⊕.
The right peak of this bimodal distribution (2-5 R⊕) is
made up of sub-Neptune (2-4 R⊕), and Neptunes planets
(R≥4 R⊕). For this population of planets, a broad range
of scenarios are possible, including water-worlds, rocky
super-Earths and planets with H- and He- dominated
atmospheres (e.g. L´eger et al. 2004; Valencia et al. 2006;
Rogers & Seager 2010a,b; Rogers et al. 2011; Rogers
2015; Zeng et al. 2019a). Atmospheric measurements are
needed to understand their composition. To date, very
few atmospheric studies concerning this class of planets
have been conducted (see Table 1), but a larger number
of observations will be necessary to put constraints on
the planetary formation and migration theories and link
the larger gas giants to the smaller terrestrial planets.

An element of comparison, which allows us to bet-
ter understand the atmospheric physics of sub-Neptune
and Neptune-type exoplanets, can be found in our Solar
System, more precisely in Uranus and Neptune. These
ice giants can be used as (cold) template for listing the
physical phenomena present in this class of planets, and
a good understanding of them would give access to more
accurate extrapolations for diﬀerent temperatures of the
planets. One element to emphasis is the large diﬀer-
ences in atmospheric composition between Uranus and
Neptune, reviewed in Moses et al. (in press). The ob-
servability of chemical compounds is deﬁned by equilib-
rium chemistry in the hot interior, modiﬁed in the up-
per atmosphere by transport-induced quenching as well
as photochemistry. The dynamic activity of the planet
(modelized by an eddy diﬀusion coeﬃcient for simpliﬁed
mixing calculations) can therefore have a direct eﬀect

on the observable composition. Such eﬀects could have
to be considered for this class of planets, especially for
warm sub-Neptune and Neptune-type planets.
In this paper we analyse the transmission spectra of
the Neptune-type HD 106315 c and of the sub-Neptune
HD 3167 c, using publicly available observations from
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Cam-
era 3 (WFC3) operating in its spatial scanning mode.

The ﬁrst small warm planet we studied in this paper is
HD 106315 c. With a mass of 14.6±4.7 M⊕, a radius of
4.98±0.23 R⊕, and a density of 0.65±0.23 g cm−3, it or-
bits its F5V host star with a period of 21.05731±0.00046 day
(this work, Table 2). Its equilibrium temperature, com-
puted by assuming an albedo of 0.2 (Crossﬁeld & Kreid-
berg 2017), is 835±20 K. The planet has a inner-smaller
companion HD 106315 b (RP=2.18±0.33 R⊕, this work).
The discovery of this multi-planetary system was simul-
taneously announced by Crossﬁeld et al. (2017) and
Rodriguez et al. (2017) using data from the K2 mission.
Due to the paucity of radial velocities measurements,
both teams were not able to derive a precise measure-
ment of the planetary mass, and only the High Accuracy
Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) radial veloc-
ity observations by Barros et al. (2017) allowed a mass
estimation. More recently, Zhou et al. (2018) reported
also an obliquity measurement (λ = −10 ◦. 9+3.6
−3.8) for
HD 106315 c from Doppler tomographic observations
gathered with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle
(MIKE), HARPS, and Tillinghast Reﬂector Echelle
Spectrograph (TRES). Given the brightness of the host
star (V=8.951±0.018 mag, Crossﬁeld et al. 2017), the
atmospheric scale height (H∼518 ± 174 km, calcu-
lated by assuming a primary mean molecular weight of
2.3 amu), and the contribution to the transit depth of
1 scale height (40 ± 14 ppm, calculated by using the
relationship that the change in transit depth due to
a molecular feature scales as 2 H Rp/R2
(cid:63), Brown et al.
2001), HD 106315 c represents a golden target on which
to perform transmission spectroscopy, and thus, to pro-
vide constraints on not only the planetary interior, but
also the formation and evolution history.

The other small-size planet we analyzed in this work
It was discovered orbiting its host star,
is HD 3167 c.

et al. (2017) and Christiansen et al. (2017) then re-
vised the system parameters and determined radii and
masses for the two exoplanets. HD 3167 c has a mass
of MP=8.33+1.79
−0.100 R⊕
(Gandolﬁ et al. 2017), and a temperature of Teq=518±12 K
(assuming an albedo of 0.2). It orbits its K0V host star
with a period of 29.84622+0.00098
−0.00091 days. Given a mean
density of ρ=2.21+0.56
−0.53 g cm−3, Gandolﬁ et al. (2017)
quoted that HD 3167 c should have had a solid core
surrounded by a thick atmosphere. The brightness of

the host star (V=8.94± 0.02 mag, Vanderburg et al.
(2016)) combined with the atmospheric scale height
(171 ± 40 km, calculated by assuming a primary mean
molecular weight of 2.3 amu), and with the contribution
to the transit depth of one scale height (18 ± 4 ppm, this
work) make the planet a suitable target for atmospheric
characterization.

We used the publicy avaiable Python package Iraclis
(Tsiaras et al. 2018a) to analyze the raw HST/WFC3
images of the two warm small planets. In § 2 we present
the diﬀerent steps we performed to obtain our 1D trans-
mission spectra from the raw images. We then explain
(§ 3) the modeling of the extracted spectra carried out
by using the publicly available spectral retrieval algo-
rithm TauREx3 (Waldmann et al. 2015b,a; Al-Refaie
In § 4, we discuss our ﬁndings under-
et al. 2019).
ling possible limitations of our data-analysis and due to
WFC3’s narrow spectral coverage. We draw also some
interpretations of the interior compositions of the two
exoplanets, and we put our results in comparison with
other low spectral resolution studies (e.g.
those aris-
ing from ARES, i.e. Edwards et al. 2020; Skaf et al.
2020; Pluriel et al. 2020b). We then simulate possi-
ble future studies with the upcoming space-borne in-
struments, such as the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST), and Ariel. Finally, we conclude (§ 5) by high-
lighting the importance of future atmospheric character-
isation both from the ground and from the space.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

From the comparison of the above-mentioned papers
(Crossﬁeld et al. 2017; Rodriguez et al. 2017; Barros
et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2018) a discrepancy emerges in
the light-curve parameters of HD 106315 c, and in par-
ticular in the value of the planetary radius (RP). On one
hand, the photometric studies by Crossﬁeld et al. (2017);

4

Rodriguez et al. (2017), and Barros et al. (2017) seem
to converge toward a lower planetary radius (∼4 R⊕),
but with big error bars (this is probably a consequence
of having a light curve with a high impact parameter).
More precisely, Crossﬁeld et al. (2017) measured a plan-
etary radius of 3.95+0.42
−0.39 R⊕, Rodriguez et al. (2017) of
4.40+0.25
−0.27 R⊕, and Barros et al. (2017) of 4.35±0.23 R⊕.
On the other hand, the independent spectroscopic anal-
ysis by Zhou et al. (2018) resulted in a higher RP value
with smaller uncertainties (i.e. RP=4.786±0.090 R⊕).
To overcome these inconsistencies, before looking at
the HD 106315 c’s HST/WFC3 data, we decided to per-
form a combined analysis, using both spectroscopic and
photometric observations. More precisely, we included
in our analysis ESO/HARPS radial velocities (Barros
et al. 2017), space-based K2 data and three ground-
based transits, namely one observation gathered with
the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) telescopes (Barros
et al. 2017) and two with the EULER telescope (Lendl
et al. 2017). We modeled these data by employing the
Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian Planet Analysis
and Small Transit Investigation Software (PASTIS) code
(D´ıaz et al. 2014) as done in Barros et al. (2017). The
improved system’s parameters are listed in Table 2. In
particular, if we compare our results to the previous pa-
pers, trying to break the above-mentioned inconsistency
on the RP value, we note that our planetary radius is in
agreement with that found by the spectroscopic analysis
of Zhou et al. (2018).

Our analysis is based on four and ﬁve transit observa-
tions of HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c, respectively (Ta-
ble 3). Both were obtained with the G141 infrared grism
(1.125 - 1.650 µm) of the HST/WFC3. The observations
were part of the HST proposal GO 15333 (PI: Ian Cross-
ﬁeld) and were downloaded from the public Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) archive. An in-
dependent analysis of the same dataset for HD 106315 c
and HD 3167 c, with diﬀerent pipelines, is presented by
Kreidberg et al. (2020) and Mikal-Evans & et al. (sub-
mitted), respectively. We analyzed and extracted white
and spectral light-curves from the raw HST/WFC3 im-
ages using Iraclis (Tsiaras et al. 2018a). This tool
includes multiple diﬀerent steps:

∗ Data reduction and calibration (§ 2.1)
∗ Light-curves extraction (§ 2.2)
∗ Limb-darkening coeﬃcients calculation (§ 2.3)
∗ White light-curves ﬁtting (§ 2.4)
∗ Spectral light-curves ﬁtting (§ 2.5)

Each transit was observed over six and seven HST or-
bits for HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c, respectively. We
used both forward (increasing row number) and reverse
(decreasing row number) scanning.

2.1. Data reduction and calibration

The ﬁrst step of the Iraclis pipeline is the reduc-
tion and calibration of the HST/WFC3 raw images.
This part of the analysis consists of several operations:
zero-read subtraction, reference pixels correction, non-
linearity correction, dark current subtraction, gain con-
version, sky background subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁeld correc-
tion, bad pixels/cosmic rays correction and wavelength
calibration (Tsiaras et al. 2016b,c, 2018b).

2.2. Light-curve extraction

After the reduction and calibration of the raw images,
we extracted the wavelength-dependent light-curves.
In performing this operation the geometric distortions
caused by the tilted detector of the WFC3/IR channel
are taken into account, as explained in Tsiaras et al.
(2016b).
Two kinds of light-curve were extracted:

∗ a white light-curve:

calculated from a broad
wavelength band (1.088 – 1.68 µm) covering the
whole wavelength range of WFC3/G141,

∗ a set of spectral light-curves: extracted using a
narrow band with a resolving power at 1.4 µm of
70. The bins were selected such that the signal to
noise is approximately uniform across the plane-
tary spectrum. We ended up with 25 bands, with
bin-widths in the range 188.0-283.0 nm.

2.3. Limb darkening coeﬃcients

The stellar limb darkening eﬀect is modelled using the
non-linear formula with four terms from Claret (2000).
The coeﬃcients are calculated by ﬁtting the stellar pro-
ﬁle from an ATLAS model (Kurucz 1970; Howarth 2011)
and by using the stellar parameters presented in Table 2.
Table 4 shows the limb-darkening coeﬃcients calculated
for the white light-curve (between 1.125 - 1.650 µm).

2.4. White light-curves ﬁtting

The products of the previous steps are the white and
spectral light-curves. To continue our characterization
of the two exoplanet atmospheres we then created trans-
mission spectra which were obtained by ﬁtting the light-
curves with a transit model. However, before ﬁtting
the extracted white and spectral light-curves, we had to
consider the time-dependent systematics introduced by
HST: one long-term ‘ramp’ (which aﬀects all the visits)
with a linear (and, in some cases, a quadratic) trend and
one short-term ‘ramp’ (which aﬀects every HST orbit)
with an exponential trend.

In order to remove all these systematics, we ﬁtted
the white light-curves using the transit python package
P yLightcurve, i.e. we used a transit model multiplied

by a model for the systematics (Tsiaras et al. 2016b,
2018b):

Second order (quadratic) visit-long ramps were also ﬁt-
ted for HD 3167 c visits because they were more aﬀected
by systematics. The parameter space was sampled via
emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We used 300000

tions. We employed this set up for all the visits for both
the planets. The only exception is represented by the
fourth visit of HD 106315 c were we had to use 200000
iterations to obtain a good ﬁt to our data.
Figure 1 shows the light-curves for the ﬁrst transits
of both exoplanets divided by the best-ﬁt systematic
model. (The same plots for the other transits are shown
in appendix in Figure A.1). In the ﬁt we took T0 and
RP/R(cid:63) as free parameters, and we used ﬁxed values for
P , ω, i, a/R(cid:63), and e parameters, as reported in Table 2.
We made this choice because we miss ingress/egress ob-
servations in some visits. For both the planets we de-
cided to eliminate data gathered during the ﬁrst HST
orbit and the ﬁrst two points of each orbit because of
the stronger systematics that aﬀect them. An incorrect
ﬁtting of the behavior of the instrument at this stage
would have introduced additional uncertainties in the
ﬁnal values of the transit parameters. Processing vis-
its 3 and 4 for HD 3167 c required additional steps; this
was on account of poor initial ﬁtting due to HD 3167 b
also transiting the stellar disk during these observations.
Strong auto-correlation in the ﬁt residuals for visits 3
and 4 led to an investigation of the orbits for both the
transiting planets in the HD 3167 system: b and c. The-
oretical transit light curves were plotted for all four HD
3167 observation windows, again using P yLightcurve
and taking parameters for both planets from Gandolﬁ
et al. (2017). The theoretical light curves showed no
overlap between transits for the ﬁrst two visits but con-
tamination of the third and fourth visits by concurrent
transits of HD 3167 b. In both cases this eﬀect was lim-
ited to a single HST orbit in each aﬀected visit. These
two orbits were then disregarded, leaving six orbits for
each of visits 1, 2, and 5 ﬁve orbits apiece for vists 3
and 4. These aﬀected orbits can be seen in the ap-
pendix in ﬁgure A.2. The ﬁnal ﬁtting results and their
uncertainties can be found in Table 4.

2.5. Spectral light-curves ﬁtting

In order to correct for the systematics present in the
spectral light-curves, we used the divide white method
introduced by Kreidberg et al. (2014c), i.e. each spectral
light-curve was ﬁtted with a model that includes the
white light curve and its best-ﬁt model:

nscan
λ

[1 − ra(t − T0)]

LCW
MW

(2)

where ra is the coeﬃcient of a wavelength-dependent
linear slope along each HST visit, LCW is the white
light-curve, MW is best ﬁtting model to the white light-
curve, nscan
is the normalisation factor we used (it
changes to nfor
λ , when the scanning direction is upwards,

λ

and to nrev
λ when it is downwards). As Table 4 shows
we obtained big numbers for these normalization fac-
tors, these is due because the light curve are in units of
electrons, thus the large values are reasonable. In the
spectral light-curve ﬁtting, the only free parameter is
RP/R(cid:63), while the other parameters are the same as we
used for the white light-curve ﬁtting. Using the white
light-curve as a comparison has the advantage that the
residuals from ﬁtting one of the spectral light-curves (see
Figure 2) do not show trends similar to those in the
white light-curve (see Figure 1). All the spectral and
white light-curves we obtained, for the ﬁrst HST visit of
each planet, are plotted in Figure 3. As for the white
light-curves ﬁtting, the parameters space was sampled
by using the emcee method. In this case we used 50000
emcee iterations, 100 walkers and 20000 burned itera-
tions.
Starting from the spectral light-curves, the ﬁnal spectra
were extracted and combined from the spectral light-
curves by computing the average of the transit spec-
tra weighted by their respective uncertainties. First we
subtracted each spectrum by the corresponding white
light-curve depth, and then we computed the weighted
average of all the transit observations. Finally, we added
the weighted average of all white light-curves values to
the averaged spectrum. The white light transit depths
were consistent between transits, except for visit 3 for
HD 3167 c (0.0291±0.0005 compared to the weighted
mean 0.03058±0.00015). This is probably due to re-
maining systematics or to stellar activity. We obtained
a ﬁnal spectrum with an increased S/N ratio (Table 5,
and Figure 4) which we then used for atmospheric re-
trieval.

3. ATMOSPHERIC CHARACTERISATION

3.1. TauREx setup

Once each planetary spectrum was obtained, we ﬁtted
it using the retrieval code TauREx31 (Al-Refaie et al.
2019). This algorithm uses the nested sampling code
Multinest (Feroz et al. 2009) to map the atmospheric
forward model parameter space and ﬁnd the best ﬁt to
our empirical spectra. In our retrieval analysis we used
1500 live points and an evidence tolerance of 0.5.

The atmosphere of the two warm small planets was
simulated by assuming an isothermal temperature-
pressure (T/P) proﬁle with molecular abundances con-
stant as a function of altitude. These assumptions are
acceptable since, due to the short wavelength covered
by HST/WFC3, we are probing a restricted range of the

planetary T/P proﬁle (Tsiaras et al. 2018b). We note
that this may not be the case anymore with next gener-
ation space telescopes (Rocchetto et al. 2016; Changeat
et al. 2019). We calculated the equilibrium tempera-
tures of the two planets using the following formula:

Teq = T(cid:63)

(cid:19)1/2

(cid:18) R(cid:63)
2 a

(1 − A)1/4

(3)

where R(cid:63) is the stellar radius, a is the semi-major axis,
A is the geometric albedo. Assuming an albedo of 0.2
(Crossﬁeld & Kreidberg 2017), we obtained a temper-
ature of 835 ± 20 K and 518 ± 12 K for HD 106315 c
and HD 3167 c, respectively. We then used a wide
range of temperature priors ±60% Teq (334–1336 K for
HD 106315 c, and 207–829 K for HD 3167 c) to allow dif-
ferent temperatures around the expected Teq. The plan-
etary radius is also ﬁtted in the model ranging from
±50% of the values reported in Table 2 (0.22-0.68 RJ
for HD 106315 c, and 0.12-0.38 RJ for HD 3167 c).

We simulated atmospheres with pressures between
10−2 and 106 Pa, uniformly distributed in log-space
across 100 plane-parallel layers. We considered the fol-
lowing trace-gases: H2O (Polyansky linelist, Polyansky
et al. 2018), CH4 (Exomol linelist, Yurchenko & Ten-
nyson 2014), CO (linelist from Li et al. 2015), CO2
(Hitemp linelist, Rothman et al. 2010), NH3 (Exomol
linelist, Yurchenko et al. 2011) and assumed the atmo-
sphere to be H2/He dominated. Each trace-gas abun-
dance was allowed to vary between 10−12 and 10−1 in
volume mixing ratios (log-uniform prior). We used ab-
sorption cross-sections at a resolution of 15000 and in-
clude Rayleigh scattering and collision induced absorp-
tion of H2–H2 and H2–He (Abel et al. 2011; Fletcher
et al. 2018; Abel et al. 2012). Clouds are modeled as-

suming a grey opacity model and cloud top pressure
bounds are set between 10−2 and 106 Pa. All priors are
listed in Table 6. Recently, Kreidberg et al. (2020) pre-
sented a transmission spectrum of HD 106315 c based on
HST/WFC3, K2, and Spitzer observations. They chose
to add N2 in the retrieval analysis of HD 106315 c to
compensate for invisible molecular opacities that could
impact the mean molecular weight. The high equilib-
rium temperature of HD 106315 c (∼800 K) suggests in-
deed the favored presence of N2. However, we note
that no further constraints have been found regarding
N2 opacity in the posterior distributions presented in
Kreidberg et al. (2020) . Considering this result and for
consistency with HD 3167 c whose equilibrium temper-
ature is lower (∼500 K), we decided to consider NH3
instead of N2 in the retrieval analysis for both plan-
ets. This choice is mainly motivated by the low density
of HD 106315 c (∼600 kg/m3) indicating, most likely, a
primary light atmosphere. We therefore decided not to
add N2 to the analysis in order to maintain a primary
mean molecular weight (µ ∼2.3 amu).

To assign a signiﬁcance to our detection, we used the
ADI (Atmospheric Detectability Index) (Tsiaras et al.
2018b). It is a positively deﬁned Bayes Factor between
the nominal atmospheric model and a ﬂat-line model (a
model which contains no active trace gases, Rayleigh
scattering or collision induced absorption). We also
computed two other Bayes factors in the same way as
the ADI. The ﬁrst one, ∆E1 is used to compute the sig-
niﬁcance of a molecule detection using a Bayes factor
between the nominal atmospheric model and the same
model without the considered molecule. The second one,
∆E2 compares a given model to a model containing only
water, Rayleigh scattering and collision-induced absorp-

tion as the reference Bayesian’s evidence. It is used to
asses the necessity of a complex model to explain the
atmosphere of the observed planet. These Bayes fac-
tors were then translated into a statistical signiﬁcance
(Kass & Raftery 1995) by using Table 2 of Benneke &
Seager (2013). Signiﬁcances greater than 3.6 are consid-
ered ‘strong’, 2.7-3.6 are ‘moderate’, 2.1-2.7 ‘weak’, and
below 2.1 ‘insigniﬁcant’.

3.2. Results

Table 6 lists our full TauREx retrieval results for the
two planets while posterior distributions are plotted in
Figure 7 and Figure 8. Retrieved best-ﬁt spectra and
corresponding best-ﬁt molecular opacity contributions
are shown in Figure 6. For each opacity source, the con-
tribution function is the transit depth that we would
obtain if the molecule was alone in the atmosphere.
Therefore, the opacity sources, like H2O in HD 3167 c
(Figure 6 d) are never fully dominant since there are
always some residuals CIA, Rayleigh or other molecules
that contribute to the model. Opacity contributions are

represented for one solution, the one considered as the
best one statistically speaking, i.e with the highest log
evidence. The oﬀset opacities correspond to molecules
that do not contribute to the ﬁt and are found to be
unconstrained. Besides, the grey line in Figure 6 c and
d represents the top cloud pressure retrieved by Tau-
REx for the best ﬁt solution. The signal is theoreti-
cally blocked by this layer and nothing can be observed
at higher pressures. Opacities found below this line
are unconstrained. Using the Bayesian log evidences,
we computed the ADI, ∆E1 and ∆E2 as explained in
§ 3.1. For both planets, retrieval results are consistent
with water absorption features detectable in the spec-
tral band covered by the G141 grism. We note a sig-
niﬁcant detection of carbon-bearing species in the at-

mosphere of HD 3167 c consistent with CO2 absorption
features. This result is unexpected, indeed, considering
the planetary equilibrium temperature, CH4 features are
more likely to be present than CO2 (see e.g., Figure 5
and Venot et al. 2020). Other species like NH3, CO
and CH4 have either unconstrained or low abundances.
They could be present in both atmospheres, but spectra
do not present signiﬁcant absorption features. We note
however that NH3 abundance is better constrained in
the atmosphere of HD 106315 c (see Figure 7). Clouds
top pressure is retrieved at diﬀerent levels, 103.7 Pa for
HD 106315 c and 105.3 Pa for HD 3167 c, corresponding
to an upper bound (see the posterior distribution in Fig-
ure 7, and 8). The presence of molecular features in our
spectra suggests a clear atmosphere for both planets. If
opaque clouds are present, they are located below the
region probed by WFC3/G141 observations.

3.2.1. HD 106315 c

According to the ADI, we retrieved a signiﬁcant
(5.99σ) atmosphere around the warm Neptune HD 106315 c
with a notable water detection. H2O is the only species
that explains the absorption features between 1.3 and
1.5 µm (Figure 6). We obtained a temperature of
630+326
−115 K which is lower than the equilibrium tempera-
ture, but consistent within 1σ. This could be explained
by the fact that we are probing the atmosphere in the
terminator area, and we modeled the atmosphere in 1D
using an isothermal proﬁle (Caldas et al. 2019; Mac-
Donald et al. 2020; Pluriel et al. 2020a). Skaf et al.
(2020), by analysing their three Hot Jupiters (WASP-
127 b, WASP-79 b and WASP-62 b) together with the
exoplanets from Tsiaras et al. (2018b), highlighted the
existence of a global trend between the equilibrium and
the retrieved temperatures, with the retrieved temper-
atures showing almost always lower values.
In Fig-
ure 9 we updated Figure 6 from Skaf et al. (2020) by
adding the retrieved/equilibrium temperatures of the
two Neptunes-like planets analysed in this work. We
can see that HD 106315 c follows the global trend.
The best-ﬁt solution contains a notable amount of water,
log10[H2O] = −2.1+0.7
−1.3. Figure 7 shows that the right
wing of the water’s abundance Gaussian distribution is
not complete. This indicates that the abundance of H2O
could take even higher values (log10[H2O] ∼ −1), but
this is an unrealistic solution for a primary atmosphere,
expected here for this Neptune-type planet. This is due
to the limited coverage of HST/WFC3 G141. We note
that the Bayes factor between a pure water model and
the full chemical model ∆E2 is equal to 6.07 (see Ta-
ble 7) meaning that the complexity of the full chemical
model is justiﬁed with a ‘strong’ signiﬁcance (3.91σ).

The temperature retrieved by TauRex (∼600 K)
is compatible with absorption from NH3, and this
strenghtens our choice to consider NH3 as active gas
instead of N2. However, NH3 contribution is debat-
able – the detection is driven by a few points at 1.28,
1.55 µm and 1.60 µm, hence the weak abundance of
log10[NH3] = −4.3+0.7
−2.0. We note that a high temper-
ature solution gives no constraint on NH3 abundance
whereas a lower temperature requires the molecule to
be present (Figure 7). NH3 abundance is also corre-
lated to the amount of H2O. Moreover, we can only
put constraints on the higher abundance of CH4:
it
could be found below 10−5. CO and CO2 abun-
dances are unconstrained. The model ﬁnds a clouds
top pressure of 103.7 Pa correlated to the amount of
H2O: the deeper the clouds are, the more water we
have. The best-ﬁt solution suggests a clear atmo-

sphere with a signiﬁcant amount of water.
der to give an estimation of the planetary C/O ra-
tio, we employed the following formula re-adapted
from MacDonald & Madhusudhan (2019): C/O =
(XCH4 + XCO + XCO2)/(XH2O + XCO + 2CO2),
where the numerator indicates all species containing
C atoms, while the numerator indicates all other O-
bearing species. As we obtained a constrained value
only for the water abundance, we decided to explore
the range of valid C/O by using not only the mean
abundances, but also the upper/lower possible values
allowed by the posteriors (see Table 6). In this way, we
obtained a C/O ratio that could vary in the range (7.5
×10−9-0.60).

3.2.2. HD 3167 c

The ADI value found for HD 3167 c retrieval is lower
than the one computed for HD 106315 c (Table 6), yet
it corresponds to a 4.76σ signiﬁcance detection of an
atmosphere around this sub-Neptune. The temperature
retrieved by TauREx (440+119
−79 K) is lesser then the equi-
librium temperature obtained assuming an albedo equal
to 0.2, but it is consistent within 1σ.

The main diﬀerence with HD 106315 c’s atmosphere
is the strong detection of CO2, and more generally the
presence of carbon-bearing species. Opacity source con-
tributions in Figure 6 show both water and carbon diox-
ide features; these two species seem required to ﬁt the
data obtained by HST/WFC3 and their abundances
are highly correlated (see Figure 8). ∆E2 is equal to
6.65 (Table 7) meaning that the full chemical model
is statistically signiﬁcant (4.07σ) compared to a pure
water model. This is probably driven by the carbon
dioxide detection that explains the absorption features
at 1.20 µm, 1.45 µm, and 1.60 µm. The best-ﬁt so-

have been calculated using the Reliable Analytic Thermochemical Equilibrium (RATE) Python open-source package (Cubillos
et al. 2019), assuming a solar elemental composition. Panel a highlights that given the range of pressures probed by HST/WFC3
-marked by black dashed horizontal lines-, and the planet’s equilibrium temperature the presence of N2 should be favour over
that of NH3 in the atmosphere of HD 106315 c. Moreover, panel b shows as H2O, CH4, and NH3 are the expected molecules in

ter log10[H2O] = −4.1+0.9
would have expected CH4 to be the main carbon-bearing
species instead of CO2.

Looking at the posterior distributions in Figure 8, we
can constrain the higher limits of ammonia and methane
abundances, which are below 10−5. The monoxide abun-
dance posterior distribution is highly degenerate, hence
the weak detection. Carbon dioxide and monoxide fea-
tures are diﬃcult to distinguish in WFC3/G141 observa-
tions because they have similar features between 1.5 µm
and 1.6 µm, leading potentially to degeneracies between
the two abundances. The amounts of H2O and CO2, as
well as the planet temperature and radius are correlated.
For less water and carbon dioxide, the model requires a
higher temperature and lower radius at 10 bar atmo-
spheric pressure (see Figure 8). The best-ﬁt solution
suggests a clear atmosphere with a top cloud pressure
retrieved at 1 bar. As for HD 106315 c, we derived a
range of possible values in which the C/O ratio could
vary, i.e. (0.49-0.85).

4. DISCUSSION

Considering the narrow wavelength coverage and the
low data resolution, the results obtained here are to
be considered carefully and put into perspective. The
model we tested has 8 free parameters and 25 observa-
tion data points. Molecular abundances and tempera-
tures retrieved by TauREx are sensitive to the inputs
and bounds set up by the users. TauREx gives us a ﬁrst

.

insight into these exoplanets’ atmospheres and, in par-
ticular for HST/WFC3, helps us to infer the presence
of water. To better constrain the molecular detections
found in § 3.2, we analysed diﬀerent simulations (A0-A5
and B0-B7 in Table 7, for HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c,
respectively) that include the expected molecules con-
sidering the wavelength coverage and the equilibrium
temperature A0 and B0 are ﬂat-line models that help
us compute the ADI and A2 and B2, pure water models
are used to compute ∆E2.

4.1. Strength of H2O detection

For both planets, to assess the signiﬁcance of H2O de-
tection, we removed this active gas from the full chemi-
cal model and we analysed the Bayes factor ∆E1. It de-
creases from 226.91 (A1) to 212.70 (A3) (see Table 7)
and from 235.41 (B1) to 231.80 (B3) for HD 106315 c
and HD 3167 c, respectively. H2O detection is statisti-
cally conﬁrmed for both planets with a ‘strong’ signif-
icance (5.68σ) for HD 106315 c, and a ‘moderate’ one
(3.17σ) for HD 3167 c.
In the recent paper by Kreid-
berg et al. (2020), they reported a tentative detection
(with a Bayes factor of 1.7 or 2.6, depending on prior
assumptions) of water vapor with a small amplitude of
30 ppm. In this simultaneous and independent analysis,
by using diﬀerent algorithms both for the extraction of
the transmission spectrum from the WFC3 data (with
Iraclis), and for the retrieval analysis (performed with
TauREx3), we also detect the presence of water in the

atmosphere of HD 106315 c with a high signiﬁcance.
Moreover our observed spectrum seems to be compati-
ble with deeper H2O features, which reinforces the de-
tection. To date, water has been detected on several
Neptune and sub-Neptune planets which allows compar-
isons. HD 106315 c could be compared to to HAT-P-11 b
(with a water detection’s signiﬁcance, hereafter σH2O,
of 5.1σ, Fraine et al. 2014), and to GJ 3470 b (σH2O=
5.2σ, Benneke et al. 2019a). While HD 3167 c has a
lower water detection, appearing more similar to K2-
18 b (σH2O=3.6σ, Tsiaras et al. 2019, and σH2O=3.93σ,
Benneke et al. 2019b). Crossﬁeld & Kreidberg (2017)
studied the water features amplitude of six warm Nep-
tune planets and highlighted correlations with the equi-
librium temperature and the mass fraction of hydrogen
and helium. To verify the correlation of H2O amplitude,
in units of atmospheric scale height, with the equilib-
rium temperature we computed HD 106315 c, HD 3167 c
and K2-18 b water amplitude using HST/WFC3 spec-
tra obtained here and in Tsiaras et al. (2019). We used
the same method described in Crossﬁeld & Kreidberg

(2017). We ﬁtted a carbon-free template of GJ 1214 b
normalized in units of scale height (Crossﬁeld et al.
2011) to the observations using the Levenberg and Mar-
quardt’s least squares method (L-M) (Markwardt 2009).
Then, we measured the amplitude taking the normalized
average value from 1.34µm to 1.49µm and subtracting
it from the average value outside this wavelength range.
The scale height H=KBTeq/µg is computed assuming a
hydrogen rich atmosphere (µ=2.3 amu) and the equi-
librium temperature is calculated for an albedo of 0.2.
We ﬁnd a water feature amplitude of 1.02±0.18 for HD
106315 c, of 1.04±0.24 for HD 3167 c, and of 1.28±0.49
for K2-18 b. We note that Kreidberg et al. (2020) recent
paper found a lower absorption feature, i.e 0.80±0.04
for HD 106315 c. We plot our values in Figure 10 along
with the amplitudes computed in Crossﬁeld & Kreid-
berg (2017) and the ones found in Libby-Roberts et al.
(2020) for Kepler 51 b and Kepler 51 d. Finally, we ﬁtted
a linear relation and compared the Pearson correlation
coeﬃcient and the probability. We ﬁnd a correlation
coeﬃcient of 0.43 and a p-value of 0.18. The strong cor-

relation highlighted in Crossﬁeld & Kreidberg (2017) is
not found here, mostly because of K2-18 b high water
feature amplitude at low temperature. While removing
K2-18 b and Kepler 51 d amplitudes – to focus on planets
with temperature between 500 and 1000 K as in Cross-
ﬁeld & Kreidberg (2017)- we ﬁnd a correlation coeﬃcient
of 0.70 and p-value of 0.04 while they found a coeﬃcient
of 0.83 for a p-value equal to 0.04. A reﬁnement of the
scale height, HST/WFC3 water amplitude and correla-

tions computations will be detailed in a follow-up paper
focusing on intermediate size planets (RP < 6 R⊕) with
consistent published spectra.

In § 3.2, we retrieved a clear atmosphere for both plan-
ets, but we expect species to condense and clouds to

Figure 8. HD 3167 c atmospheric retrieval posterior distributions

(Kreidberg et al. 2014b) and HD 97658 b (Knutson et al.
2014b) were interpreted as high cloud or haze at low
pressure. We conﬁrm the clear atmosphere by removing
the cloud top pressure parameter from the full chemi-
cal model. ADIs of cloud free models (A4 and B4 in
Table 7) are higher than ADIs of full chemical models
including clouds (A1 and B1 in Table 7). Clouds do
not impact retrieval results, even for HD 106315 c with
a lower top clouds pressure, and this means that either

the planet has a clear atmosphere or the clouds are lo-
cated below the visible pressure where the atmosphere
is opaque. Looking at HD 106315 c’s clouds top pressure
correlations with H2O abundance (see Figure 7), a sec-
ond mode appears meaning that clouds could be present
in the region we are probing.

The TauREx retrieval does not bring any information
on cloud composition and we must recall that the wave-
length coverage is not wide enough to constrain cloud

4.3. NH3 in HD 106315 c’s atmosphere

i.e log10[NH3] = −4.3+0.7

HD 106315 c’s best ﬁt solution includes a small amount
of NH3,
−2.0. Looking at the
posteriors distribution (Figure 7), NH3 abundance con-
verges toward a solution. To conﬁrm this detection,
we removed this gas from the full chemical model and
computed ∆E1 (see A5 in Table 7). The diﬀerence
is 0.91 meaning that NH3’s detection has to be con-
sidered ‘not-signiﬁcant’ (1.97σ). However, we observe
some diﬀerences, the temperature rises to 1004 K with
less constraints and consequently, the radius decreases
to 0.374 RJ. Clouds are found at a higher level 102.5 Pa.
The cloud deck compensates for NH3 features by cutting
H2O ones and shrinking the spectrum. From this analy-
sis, we conclude that HD 106315 c can be surrounded by
either a primary clear atmosphere with H2O and traces
of NH3 or by a primary atmosphere with H2O and deep
clouds.
As mentioned in § 3.1 the high equilibrium temperature
of HD 106315 c should have favor the presence of N2 in-
stead of NH3 (see e.g., Figure 5). NH3 is expected to
disappear above 500-550 K. However, we retrieve at the
terminator, so we should expect a lower temperature
(closer to this 500 K limit) and more NH3. Moreover,
N2 is an inactive gas, with no feature in WFC3, which
means that the ‘free’ retrieval we perform – the retrieval
in ‘free’ mode is used to retrieve the abundance for ac-
tive molecules that have features in the spectrum- will
not pick up this molecule except if it inﬂuences the mean
molecular weight. To test this, we added N2 in the anal-
ysis to see the possible consequences that this molecule
could have had on the mean molecular weight. We as-
sumed an initial N2 abundance of 10−4, compatible with
the one expected by thermochemical-equilibrium condi-
tion (see Figure 5), and we allowed it to vary between
10−12 and 10−1 in volume mixing ratios (log-uniform
prior) -as for the other molecules. The inclusion of
N2 does not aﬀect the mean molecular weight, a sim-
ple clouds model added to H2O and NH3 features are
enough to ﬁt the spectrum, there is no need to add ex-
tra molecular weight to shrink the spectrum. Moreover,
NH3 detection remains around 10−4 (see Figure A.3).

CO2 from the full chemical and compared log evidences,
it decreases from 235.41 (B1, Table 7 ) to 231.48 (B5)
corresponding to a 3.28σ “moderate” detection. The
ADI decreases as well to 5.64. We note that CO is now
compensating for CO2 features and its log abundance
increases to log10[CO] = −1.9+0.5
−1.6. This value is too
high for a realistic primary hydrogen-rich atmosphere
that we expect for this planet. We successively removed
CO from the full chemical model, but it does not im-
pact the retrieval results (B6 in Table 7) and ∆E1 is
below 1 (‘not signiﬁcant’). Finally, we removed both
CO and CO2 to asses the detection of those carbon-
bearing species (B7). The diﬀerence in log evidences
is now equal to ∆E1=5.55 and corresponds to more
than 3σ carbon detection. This test does not impact
the abundance of water nor the top cloud pressure, but
constrains better the abundance of ammonia to 10−6.4.
We note that CH4 does not compensate the lack of the
other carbon-bearing species,
it’s abundance remains
constrained below 10−5. The temperature increases to
keep a primary atmosphere hypothesis and an extended
clear atmosphere.

This unexpected detection of carbon bearing species
could be explained by noise or systematic eﬀects that
were not removed during the white light curve ﬁtting

phenomena that our 1D equilibrium chemistry modeling
cannot reproduce, e.g. 3D transport cross-terminator.
An other interpretation could be the actual presence
of CO2 in the atmosphere of HD 3167 c due for exam-
ple to a very high metallicity, enhanced over that of
the host star which is consistent with solar metallic-
ity ([Fe/H]=0.03±0.03 dex, Gandolﬁ et al. 2017).
It
is known indeed that the abundance of CO2 scales
quadratically with metallicity (see e.g. Moses 2014), and
other examples of overabundance of CO2 interpreted as
caused by an high metallicity can be found in the liter-
ature (see e.g. Madhusudhan & Seager 2011). However,
if we use the water abundance as a proxy of metallic-
ity (see e.g., Kreidberg et al. 2014a) we infer a solar or
sub-solar metallicity for HD 3167 c, which would be in
tension with the possibility that CO2 could be present
due to high metallicity. More observations are thus nec-
essary to better constraint a possible presence of CO2
in the atmosphere of HD 3167 c.

4.4. CO2 in HD 3167 c’s atmosphere

4.5. Inferences from the Mass and Radius

HD 3167 c best ﬁt solution includes an important
amount of CO2 (i.e log10[CO2] = −2.4+0.7
−1.0). This de-
tection is supported by the data points from ∼1.5 to
1.6 µm, but water seems to explains better the absorp-
tion features around 1.4 µm (see Figure 6). We removed

There is a strong degeneracy in exoplanet interiors
as there are many compositional models that are com-
patible with an observed mass and radius. However,
by combining the mass, radius, and the spectroscopic
results of our study we can get an inference for the in-

terior composition of HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c. Our
discovery of icy constituents, such as H2O in both plan-
etary atmospheres (and maybe NH3 in the envelope of
HD 106315 c) indicate an ice-rich embryo. Curiously, the
mass and radius of HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c are also
consistent with an ice-rich core which we explain below.
For the following results we adopted the planetary
models from Zeng & Sasselov (2013), Zeng et al. (2016),
and Zeng et al. (2019b). Based on the mass and radius
of HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c they are both consistent
with icy cores with hydrogen envelopes ∼ 5 wt.% and
0.3 − 1 wt.% of their total planetary masses respectively.
We show these results in Figure 11. Nevertheless, there
is still enough uncertainty in the results that a silicate
embryo engulfed by a hydrogen atmosphere is still plau-
sible for both planets. Certainly, with improved mass
and radius measurements, together with more accurate
spectroscopic observations, the interior structure of exo-
planets such as HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c will get fur-
ther constrained. We discuss the implications of this in
§ 4.7.

Besides, Mousis et al. (2020) recent publication,
showed that close-in planets could have water-rich hy-
drospheres in super-critical state. Their model suggests
that intermediate-size planets could be hydrogen/helium-
free and their interiors would simply vary from one
another depending on the water content.

4.6. Comparison with previous results

This paper is the result of work carried out during the
ARES Summer School, where we used algorithms and
data available to the public, thus allowing our results
to be tested and reproduced. This is the fourth paper
output of this summer school. In the ﬁrst work ARES
I (Edwards et al. 2020) and in the third one ARES III
(Pluriel et al. 2020b) we analysed the transmission and
the emission spectra of WASP-76 b and Kelt-7 b respec-
tively, while in the second one ARES II (Skaf et al. 2020),
the atmospheric study of WASP-42 b, WASP-79 b, and
WASP-127 b was performed. In this work, we used the
ADI as a signiﬁcance index to make the approach in our
work uniform with these previous papers, with Tsiaras
et al. (2018b), and with Tsiaras et al. (2019). Figure 12,
shows the gaseous exoplanets studied by Tsiaras et al.
(2018b) (in black), K2-18b examined in Tsiaras et al.
(2019) (in blue), the hot Jupiters analysed in ARES I,
ARES II, ARES III - for consistency with other works
here we plot the ADI obtained from the analysis of
WASP-76 b’s and Kelt-7 b’s transmission spectra - (in
red), and ﬁnally the Neptune-like planets, HD 106315 c
(in green) and HD 3167 c (in violet), studied in this pa-
per. From this ﬁgure, it emerges that, even if the two

and Uranus and Neptune (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/
planetary/factsheet/). The mass and radius models are
from Zeng & Sasselov (2013) and Zeng et al. (2016).

exoplanets characterized in this paper have smaller radii
than most of the other targets, their ADI is not smaller.
Our study, together with Tsiaras et al. (2019), shows
that even smaller planets’ atmospheres can be charac-
terized with high signiﬁcance. This opens the way for
the atmospheric study of planets with smaller radii than
the hot Jupiter targets which have mostly been analyzed
so far.

4.7. Future Characterization

It is evident that in the future the exoplanetary ﬁeld
will be based on the detailed characterisation of exo-
atmospheres. In this scenario, NASA’s upcoming JWST
its large aper-
telescope will play an important role;
ture, high sensitivity and wide spectral range will allow
the detection of molecular species in the atmospheres
of planets with diﬀerent masses: from super Earths to
super-Jovians. Scheduled to launch in the late 2020s,
the ESA Ariel space mission will enable atmospheric
characterisation of a large sample (∼1000) of exoplan-
ets in order to address how the chemical composition
of an exoplanet is linked to its formation/evolution en-
vironment (Tinetti et al. 2018; Edwards et al. 2019a).
With this prospect in mind, HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c
represent suitable targets for both these space-borne in-

struments and so we used the Ariel Radiometric Model
(ArielRad) (Mugnai et al. 2020) to simulate observa-
tions by Ariel. For each planet, we took the best-ﬁt
solution from the HST/WFC3 analysis to model Ariel
the TIER 3
observations at its native resolution (i.e.
resolution); we considered ten Ariel transits.
In addi-
tion, we simulated JWST observations using ExoWebb
Edwards et al. (2020), assuming the collection of one
single transit using NIRISS GR700XD plus a transit
with NIRSpec G395M. Figure 13, shows, for the two
planets, the results of our simulations for both JWST
(left panels, a and c) and Ariel (right panels, b and
d). It highlights the increased wavelength coverage and
data quality that will be obtained with both Ariel and
JWST. The power of having a broad wavelength cov-
erage is that we can probe multiple absorption bands
for each molecule. This helps break degeneracies due
to overlapping features and always molecular composi-
tions to be more readily constrained. Additionally, these
future missions could shore up the detections of both
NH3 (for HD 106315 c), and CO2 (for HD 3167 c): the
larger the spectral range covered, the more absorption
bands may be present. Namely, on one hand, JWST and
Ariel could highlights the CO2 absorption features be-
tween ∼1.7-2.0 µm and 4.0-5.32 µm; on the other hand
NH3 presents strong absorption features at longer wave-
lengths compared to the one probed with WFC3.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We presented here the analysis of HST/WFC3
spatially scanned observations of the Neptune-type
HD 106315 c, and of the sub-Neptune HD 3167 c re-
sulting in the detection of water vapor in both at-
mospheres. Starting from the raw data, and using the
routine Iraclis, we extracted a transmission spectrum
for both planets. We then interpreted it through the
use of the Bayesian spectral retrieval algorithm Tau-
REx3. We found a statistically signiﬁcant atmosphere
surrounding the two planets and evaluated the strength
of our detection through the ADI metric.

From the TauREx analysis, we retrieved a ‘strong’ de-
tection of H2O (log10[H2O] = −2.1+0.7
−1.3, ∆E1=14.21) and
a ‘possible evidence’ of NH3 (log10[NH3] = −4.3+0.7
−2.0,
∆E1=0.91, even if it is not signiﬁcant) in the atmosphere
of HD 106315 c. When removing ammonia, a deep cloud
deck is required to ﬁt the spectrum. We can only put
an upper bound on methane abundance (10−5), while
carbon dioxide and monoxide abundances are uncon-
strained.

The HD 3167 c analysis resulted in both a water va-
por (log10[H2O] = −4.1+0.9
−0.9, ∆E1=3.61) and a carbon
dioxide (log10[CO2] = −2.4+0.7
−1.0, ∆E1=3.93) ‘moderate’
detection. As CO2 is not explained by 1D equilibrium
chemistry models, its presence could be due to noise and

highlights the limitations of our data quality. More pre-
cise constraints on the chemical abundances could be
given if 3D models were employed instead of 1D ones.
The shortcomings of retrieval analyses performed with
1D forward models have been highlighted already in pre-
vious papers (see e.g. Caldas et al. 2019). On the con-
trary, if we assume a high metallicity, CO2 could ac-
tually be present in the atmosphere of HD 3167 c (an
increase in metallicity by a factor of x tends to increase
the abundance of CO2 by a factor of x2, see Moses see
e.g. 2014), and what we are seeing could not be due to
noise or to systematics. Thus, further observations are
needed to establish whether the CO2 might actually be
present in the atmosphere of this exoplanet.

The future is bright for atmospheric studies of exo-
planets thanks to both space-based and ground-based fa-
cilities. On one hand, Cowan et al. (2015), Greene et al.
(2016), Tinetti et al. (2018), and Edwards et al. (2019b)
have shown the potential of the JWST, Twinkle, and
Ariel space missions to characterize exo-atmospheres.
On the other, ground-based instruments such as the
European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), -and in
particular the Mid-Infrared E-ELT Imager and Spectro-
graph (METIS) instrument (Brandl et al. 2018)-, the

Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT, Skidmore et al. 2018),
and the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT, Fanson et al.
2018), will become available. This will lead to the sys-
tematic study of thousands of exoplanets’ day sides and
terminators both at high-(HRS, from the ground) and at
low-(LRS, from the space) spectral resolution. By com-
bining HRS with LRS, and thus probing diﬀerent regions
of the exoplanetary atmospheres (higher atmospheric
altitudes with HRS, lower atmospheric altitudes with
LRS), we will better understand the atmospheric com-
positions, and thus be able to apply more constraints on
their formation and evolution. Given the brightness of
their respective host stars, and the large scale heights
we computed (H∼518 ± 174 km and H∼171 ± 40 km
for HD 106315 c and HD 3167 c, respectively), the two
Neptune-like planets we studied in this paper are suit-
able targets for these upcoming instruments.

APPENDIX

A. ADDITIONAL FIGURES

In this appendix section, in Figure A.1 we show the results of the white light-curve analysis for the transits not
reported in Figure 1 for both the two exoplanets analysed in this work, whilst in Figure A.2 we plot the HD 3167 c’s
orbits that showed contamination from HD 3167 b. The last Figure of the appendix (Figure A.3) shows the posterior
distribution we obtained by including also N2 in the retrieval analysis of HD 106315 c.

Figure A.3. HD 106315 c’s posterior distribution including also N2 to the full chemical scenario. As this Figure shows, the
inclusion of nitrogen does not aﬀect the mean molecular weight. Moreover, the detection of NH3 remains around 10−4.
