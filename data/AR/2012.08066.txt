Fermi arc surface states are the hallmark of Weyl semimetals, whose identiﬁcation is usually chal-
lenged by their coexistence with gapless bulk states. Surface transport measurements by fabricating
setups on the sample boundary provide a natural solution to this problem. Here, we study the
Andreev reﬂection (AR) in a planar normal metal-superconductor junction on the Weyl semimetal
surface with a pair of Fermi arcs. For a conserved transverse momentum, the occurrence of normal
reﬂection depends on the relative orientation between the Fermi arcs and the normal of the junc-
tion, which is a direct result of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Consequently, a crossover from the
suppressed to perfect AR occurs with varying the orientation of the planar junction, giving rise to
a change from double-peak to plateau structure in conductance spectra. Moreover, such a crossover
can be facilitated by imposing a magnetic ﬁeld, making electrons slide along the Fermi arcs so as
to switch between two regimes of the AR. Our results provide a decisive signature for the detection
of Fermi arcs and open the possibilities of exploring novel phenomenology through their interplay
with superconductivity.

INTRODUCTION

In 1929, Hermann Weyl proposed a new type of mass-
less fermion with deﬁnite chirality1. After that, great
eﬀorts have been made in pursuing such elemental par-
ticles in high-energy particle physics2, yet up until now,
no candidate Weyl fermion has been reported3,4. In re-
cent years instead, Weyl fermions are surprisingly found
in an alternative form of quasi-particle excitations in
a class of solid-state materials with conic band cross-
ing, called Weyl semimetals (WSMs)5. The discovery
of WSM opens up a new avenue for the study of rela-
tivistic Weyl fermion in condensed matter physics6–22.
It provides an interesting platform for the experimental
testing of predictions made by quantum ﬁeld theory23–25
in terms of anomalous transport and optical properties
in the condensed matter context26–44.

In addition to its high-energy counterpart, WSM also
exhibits unique properties that exist only in the con-
densed matter context, especially the emergence of Fermi
arc (FA) surface states on the sample boundaries5.
In
WSMs, Weyl points always appear in pairs with oppo-
site topological charge (chirality)25, the FA spanning be-
tween each pair in the surface Brillouin zone5. Such dis-
connected FAs cannot be realized in any noninteracting
2D bulk states so that its emergence can serve as the
hallmark of WSMs9–22. It was recently shown that the
conﬁgurations of the FA are sensitive to the details of the
sample boundary45–47, which opens the possibility for en-
gineering FA and exploring its applications through sur-
face modiﬁcation. With this prospect, it is of great im-
portance to extract and analyze clear signatures of the FA
from measurement information in the presence of gapless
bulk states. Surface transport measurements provide a
natural solution to this goal because the setups contact
directly to the sample boundaries48,49.

In this work, we propose that Andreev reﬂection (AR)
in a planar normal metal (N)-superconductor (S) junc-
tion on the WSM surface can provide a unique signa-

ture of the FA. The junction consists of two parallel N
and S strip electrodes mediated by the topological sur-
face states in between; see Fig. 1(a). For the unclosed
FA, there generally exist two regions of diﬀerent AR sce-
narios, referred to as I and II in Fig. 1(c).
In region
I, no normal reﬂection channel is available [Fig. 1(a)] so
that there is a perfect AR with probability equal to unity
within the energy gap [cf. Fig. 2(c)], in spite of the inter-
face barrier. On the contrary, AR is strongly suppressed
in region II by normal reﬂection at the boundary of the
S [Fig. 1(b)] which results in a pair of resonant peaks
of the AR probability at the gap edges [cf. Fig. 2(a)].

The proportion of electrons in two regions relies on the
relative orientation between the WSM and the normal of
the planar junction. This leads to a crossover between
the double-peak and plateau structures in the conduc-
tance spectra by changing the orientation of the planar
junction in diﬀerent samples [Fig. 2(d)]. Two limiting
cases occur as the electrons reside entirely in region I or
II [Figs. 2(a) and 2(c)]. Remarkably, such a crossover
can be greatly facilitated by imposing a magnetic ﬁeld
to a properly orientated planar junction such that the
two AR regions coexist. The magnetic ﬁeld drives elec-
trons sliding along the FA and simultaneously opens up
a transport channel in the bulk, i.e., the chiral Landau
band, connected with the surface FA50. As a result, part
of the electrons can switch between the two AR regions
while the remaining ones penetrate the bulk with negli-
gible contribution to the surface transport signature. In
this way, the same crossover behavior of the conductance
can be achieved along with a reduction of its magnitude.
The AR spectra have the advantage that two scenarios
can be clearly revealed by diﬀerent shapes of the con-
ductance rather than its magnitude, which provides a
distinctive and robust signature of the FAs.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec.
In
II, we introduce the model and calculation details.
Sec.
III, we show that a crossover of the conductance
from the suppressed to perfect AR can be achieved by
varying the orientation of the planar junction. We show
that such an eﬀect can be facilitated by the magnetic
ﬁeld in Sec. IV. Finally, some remarks are given in Sec.
V.

II. MODEL AND CALCULATION DETAILS

We consider a WSM with four Weyl points, which can

be captured by the eﬀective two-band model as49

where vy is the velocity in the y direction, k0,1 and
M1,2 are parameters, σx,y,z are the Pauli matrices in the
pseudo-spin space. The two bands are degenerate at four
Weyl points kW = (±k1, 0, ±k0). The main results of this
work are associated with the relative orientation between
the FAs and the planar junction. We deﬁne θ as the az-
imuthal angle between the symmetry axis of the FA and
the normal of the junction (set to the x axis); see Fig.
1(c). Experimentally, this can be alternatively realized
by fabricating various planar junctions along diﬀerent di-
rections. The FAs with azimuthal angle θ correspond
to the rotated Hamiltonian HW (k) = H 0

condition in the y direction. To yield curved FAs simi-
lar to those in real materials47,52–54, an on-site potential
is imposed to the top layer of the WSM lattice, which
modiﬁes the dispersion of the surface states49 through
surface band bending eﬀect55–57 . The FAs for diﬀerent
azimuthal angle θ are shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(c).

To investigate the AR, we write the Hamiltonian for
the whole system in Nambu space. The electron and
hole components are decoupled in the WSM so that
the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes Hamiltonian takes a diagonal
W (k), 0; 0, −H 0∗
form of HW (k) = [H 0
W (−k)]. For a given
kz, the Hamiltonian HW (k) deﬁnes a 2D slice in mo-
mentum space. Edge states induced by the non-trivial
band topology of the bulk states emerge as the kz slice
intersects the FAs under the open boundary condition58,
which provide scattering channels for electrons (holes).
Throughout the work, all the results are calculated using
a lattice version of this model obtained by substituting
ki=x,y,z → a−1 sin kia and k2
i → 2a−2(1 − cos kia), with
a the lattice constant of the ﬁctitious cubic lattice (see
Appendix A for details).

We then discuss the transport process of the 2D slices
with diﬀerent kz. Generally, the FA can be divided into
two parts, according to whether the normal reﬂection
channels exist or not; see Fig. 1(c).
In region I, only
a single chiral edge state exists for each kz so that no
normal reﬂection can occur; see Fig. 1(d). However, a
hole channel is available for the AR, which corresponds
to the electron-paired state with opposite kz as sketched
by the blue dashed circle in Fig. 1(c). As a result, perfect
AR with unity probability can be realized. Such a band
structure for a given kz breaks particle-hole symmetry,
which cannot be realized in any 2D system. It appears
only as a subsystem of the whole 3D WSM, where two
paired electrons are from opposite kz slices carrying zero
net momentum. As all the kz channels are taken into
account, the particle-hole symmetry retains. In region II,
both normal reﬂection and AR channels exist as shown
in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), similar to a conventional metal.
Given that the normal reﬂection generally occurs at the
boundary of the S electrode due to the interface barrier
or momentum mismatch, a suppression of AR is expected
in region II, giving rise to two resonant peaks at the edges
of the band gap.

We solve the transport problem through the surface
planar junction as shown in Fig. 1(a). The N elec-
trode deposited on top of the WSM is described by
the eﬀective Hamiltonian as HN (k) = (Ck2 − µN )τz
with C determined by the eﬀective mass of the electron,
µN the chemical potential, and τx,y,z the Pauli matri-
ces in Nambu space. Similarly, the S bar is captured
by HS(k) = (Ck2 − µS)τz + ∆τx with a diﬀerent chem-
ical potential µS and a ﬁnite s-wave pair potential ∆.
Due to the proximity eﬀect, an eﬀective superconducting
gap ∆e(kz) can be induced in the FA under the S elec-
trode (see Appendix B for details). We assume that the
size of both strip electrodes in the z direction is much
larger than the Fermi wavelength and their boundaries

are smooth enough that the transverse momentum kz is
approximately conserved during scattering. Then by tak-
ing kz as a parameter, the 3D system can be decomposed
into a set of 2D slices labelled by kz, thus simplifying the
transport calculation.

III. CONDUCTANCE

We ﬁrst study the transport properties of the 2D slices
of the system labelled by kz. For a hybridized square
lattice, the Hamiltonian at a given kz is set as HW (k),
HN (k), and HS(k) for diﬀerent parts. The coupling be-
tween the N (S) and the WSM is described by coupling
strength tN (tS) between two outmost lattice layers of
contacting areas. The lattice Hamiltonian for calcula-
tion is elucidated in Appendix A. The thickness of the
WSM and the N (S) electrode in the y direction is 100
nm and 50 nm, respectively. The width of the hopping
area between the WSM and the N electrode is W = 20
nm, the separation between two electrodes is L = 40 nm
[cf. Fig. 1(b)] and the hopping between the WSM and
the S electrode extends to inﬁnity in the x direction. An
on-site potential of 6 eV is introduced at the boundary
line of the S electrode to simulate the interface barrier or
the momentum mismatch in the planar junction. Both
the WSM and N (S) electrodes connect to the leads ex-
tending to inﬁnity in the ±x directions. In the energy
scale smaller than ∆e(kz), the current is dominated by
the AR. For the two-dimensional lattice with ﬁxed kz,
the scattering process can be described by

describes the scattering amplitude from electrons of

Then the AR probability can be calculated by tak-
ing the trace of the electron-to-hole reﬂection matrix,
he(E, kz)ˆrhe(E, kz)] = (cid:80)
Akz (E) = Tr[ˆr†
he(E, kz)|2, us-
ing KWANT59, which describes the AR process that an
electron is incident from the N electrode and a hole is
reﬂected back. We plot Akz (E) in Figs. 2(a)-2(c) for
diﬀerent orientations of the FAs. In the limiting case of
θ = 0 in Fig. 2(a), all kz is in region II, so that the AR
is strongly suppressed, leaving only two resonant peaks
at E = ±∆e. Note that ∆e(kz) slightly varies with kz,
so that the positions of resonant peaks for diﬀerent kz
do not coincide.
It stems from that the surface states
labeled by kz possess diﬀerent spreading in the y direc-
tion, which determines the eﬀective coupling between the
surface states and the superconductor. Therefore, the
proximity eﬀect and the induced gap ∆e(kz) varies with
kz; see Appendix B for details. In a general case, e.g.,
θ = 0.15π in Fig. 2(b), region I and II coexist [cf. Fig.
1(c)]. As kz lies in region I, perfect AR occurs with nearly
unity probability within ∆e ; In stark contrast, for kz in
region II, the AR probability exhibits double-spike be-
havior, which indicates a strong normal reﬂection.
In
the opposite limit, e.g., θ = 0.25π in Fig. 2(c), all the
electrons reside in region I, and so the AR probability
exhibits a perfect AR plateau within ∆e. The AR prob-
ability is slightly smaller than unity which stems from
that in our simulation, the incident channels of the FA
are not fully occupied by the electrons injected from the
N electrod. Nevertheless, the perfect AR can be mani-
fested in the subgap plateau of its probability.

The crossover from suppressed to perfect AR can be

reﬂection probability.

The absolute value of conductance G relies on sam-
ple details such as the length of the strip electrodes,
which is not important to our main conclusion. We plot
the normalized conductance G/G0 with G0 = G∆=0 in
Fig. 2(d) for diﬀerent θ. The conductance spectra are
contributed by all the kz channels, thus depending on
the weight of two AR regions.
In the limiting case of
θ = 0, all the kz channels are in region II, giving rise to
a double-peak structure in the conductance spectra, the
conductance within the gap being strongly suppressed.
As θ increases from zero, a portion of kz channels trans-
fer from region II to I so that the AR probability with
either double-spike or plateau shape exists for diﬀerent
kz channels [Fig. 2(b)]. Consequently, the conductance
peaks are lowered accompanied by a rise of the conduc-
tance plateau within the gap. As θ exceeds the threshold
tan−1(k0/k1), all the electrons reside in region I with per-
fect AR. Therefore, the conductance exhibits a plateau
within the gap corresponding to perfect AR in all the kz
channels. The crossover from the double-peak to plateau
structure in the conductance spectra originates from the
high anisotropy of FA conﬁgurations and thus provides a
unique signature of the FA.

IV. MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECT

Such a crossover can be more easily observed by im-
posing a magnetic ﬁeld B in the y direction.
In this
way, only a single sample with properly orientated pla-
nar junction is required. Here, we take θ = 0.15π. The
incident electrons in the right-moving channels will slide
along the FA by the Lorentz force, leading to a switch-
ing between two AR regions. Speciﬁcally, for B < 0, a
portion of electrons originally in region I are driven into
region II, resulting in a transition from perfect to sup-
pressed AR accordingly; see Fig. 3(a). Meanwhile, some
of the electrons originally in region II are pushed into the
chiral Landau bands of the bulk due to the surface-bulk
connection at the Weyl points50; see Fig. 3(c). Those
electrons cannot reach the S electrode so that they do
not contribute to the current J ﬂowing into the S. On
the other hand, some of the reﬂected electrons also enter

the bulk [cf. Fig. 3(a)] and they do aﬀect the conduc-
tance spectra via the competition with the AR process.
In short, the magnetic ﬁeld increases the proportion of
the transport electrons in region II but reduces the total
number of current carriers. This is well reﬂected in the
conductance spectra of Fig. 3(e), where with increasing
B, there are a more visible double-peak structure and a
decrease of the conductance amplitude. As B exceeds a
critical value, all electrons reside in region II. If B in-
creases further to the saturation value Bc = (cid:126)Kz/(eL),
all electrons will transfer into the bulk and there will be
no surface electron transport. Here Kz is the span of the
FA in the kz direction [Fig. 3(a)] and L is the distance
between the N and S electrodes [Fig, 1(b)]. For the pa-
rameters Kz (cid:39) 0.71 nm−1 in Fig. 2(b) and L = 40 nm,
the saturated magnetic ﬁeld is evaluated to be Bc (cid:39) 11.7
Tesla (see Appendix C for details).

Similarly, for B > 0, electrons originally in region II are
driven into region I [Fig. 3(b)], which induces a transi-
tion from the double-spike to plateau structure of the AR
probability. Consequently, a plateau-like conductance
spectrum gradually form with increasing B, accompanied

fer of electrons from region I into the bulk [Fig. 3(d)]; see
Fig. 3(f). The response of the AR spectra to the mag-
netic ﬁeld stems from the unique surface-bulk connection
so that it provides another unambiguous evidence of the
FA.

In the calculation, we adopt the Landau gauge A =
(0, 0, Bx) so that the Peierls substitution k → −i∇ ±
eA/(cid:126) (taking e > 0) for both the electron and hole parts
retains the kz conservation. The number of electrons that
do not reach the S electrode is subtracted from Nkz in
Eq. (3) by tracking their trajectory in the −x direction
on the bottom surface, and the number of electrons trans-
ferring to the bulk for the normal reﬂection is included in
Bkz by tracking their trajectory in the x direction on the
bottom surface as well. To include the reduction of the
conductance due to the magnetic ﬁeld, all results in Figs.
3(e) and 3(f) are normalized by the same G0|B=0. For a
strong magnetic ﬁeld B (cid:39) Bc, all the incident electrons
go into the bulk so that the current J ﬂowing into the S
electrode is quenched.

V. DISCUSSION

65, and YbMnBi2

Some remarks are made below about the experimen-
tal implementation of our proposal. The surface planar
NS junction can be achieved by state-of-the-art fabrica-
tion techniques61–63. We considered the WSM with a
pair of FAs here, which have been reported in NbIrTe4
(TaIrTe4)47,52–54, WP2
64, MoTe2
66.
The main conclusion can be generalized to the situation
with more Weyl nodes straightforwardly, as the main
results stem from the anisotropy of the open FAs and
the proximity eﬀect between the superconductor and the
FAs, which do not rely on the number of the Weyl nodes.
For the multiple pairs of Weyl nodes, the present results
still hold as long as the two regions of the Andreev re-
ﬂection, without or with backscattering channels [region
I and II in Fig. 1(c)], can be well separated in the recip-
rocal space denoted by kz, then the switching between
them can be achieved in the same way by tuning θ or
B. The FA with a regular shape is beneﬁcial to our
proposal, in which the monotonic change of kz channels
between two AR regions can be revealed visibly in the
conductance spectra. This requires a big separation be-
tween Weyl points in momentum space52,64,66–69. In our
calculations, for simplicity, zero chemical potential was
taken in the WSM, where there is a vanishing density

bulk states, our main results remain unchanged as long
as the FAs are well separated from the bulk states in the
surface Brillouin zone. The presence of bulk states will
only cause certain leakage of surface electrons, but does
not change the current qualitative results. Finally, we
focused on spin-degenerate FA in this work, and for the
FA with ﬁne spin textures70,71, the analysis of AR will
be modiﬁed by including the spin degree of freedom.

the 2D slices labeled by kz have diﬀerent mass terms or
gaps in the bulk, which lead to diﬀerent spreading of the
surface states. Here only the low energy surface states
are of interest and then H 0

W reduces to

(B3)

with (cid:15)k(cid:107) the energy of the surface states for kz ∈
(−k0, k0), and γk(cid:107) the corresponding Fermi operator.

For the low-energy scale of order ∆, we can interpret

the ﬁeld operator ψk(cid:107) (y) by the surface states as

ψk(cid:107) (y) (cid:39) γk(cid:107) φk(cid:107) (y).

(B5)

where Vk(cid:107) is the eﬀective coupling between the surface
states and the superconductor. It strongly depends on
the distribution function fkz (y) of the surface states and
thus on kz. Starting from the eﬀective tunneling Hamil-
tonian, one can solve the self-energy of the surface states
due to its proximity to the superconductor.

The self-energy of the surface states in Nambu space

can be expressed as

Σsurf (ω) = ˆT †gS(ω) ˆT ,
ω + εkτz + ∆τx
k − ∆2 ,
ω2 − ε2

gS(k; ω) =

(B6)

where gS(k, ω) is the bare Green’s function in the super-
conductor and ˆT = Vk(cid:107) τz represents the tunneling terms
from the surface states to the superconductor in Ht. We
obtain the self-energy after some algebra as

Appendix B: Superconducting proximity eﬀect of
the surface states

In this section, we employ a tunneling model descrip-
tion to calculate the eﬀective pair potential ∆e(kz) in the
surface states of the WSM induced by the superconduc-
tor deposited above. We will show that the pair poten-
tial ∆e(kz) generally possesses a kz dependence. Next
we work on the continuous model instead of the discrete
one and the whole Hamiltonian contains three terms as

ψk(cid:107) (y) = [ψ1k(cid:107) (y), ψ2k(cid:107) (y)]T is the two-component Fermi
operator in the WSM that is interpreted by the in-plane
momentum k(cid:107) = (kx, kz) and spatial coordinate y in the
perpendicular direction. We assume a good quality of
contact between the superconductor and the WSM such
that k(cid:107) = (kx, kz) is conserved during tunneling.

The coupling between the superconductor and the
surface states strongly relies on the spatial distribu-
tion of the latter, which gives rise to the proximity ef-
fect. Moreover, the pairing occurs mainly around the
Fermi level (here it is the zero energy) so that it is suf-
ﬁcient to look at the surface states at the Fermi en-
ergy. We solve the surface states for a semi-inﬁnite Weyl
semimetal with the upper surface set to y = 0. Ap-
plying the substitution ky → −i∂y to Eq. (1) and tak-
ing vy = 1 for simplicity, the surface states φk(cid:107) (y) with
zero energy and kz ∈ (−k0, k0) is solved by the equation

(B10)

We focus on the weak coupling limit ξ << 1 and the
eﬀective pairing potential reduces to

∆e(kz, ω) (cid:39) ξ(kz, ω)∆.

(B11)

Note from Eq. (B8) that ξ ∝ |Vk(cid:107) |2 which increases as
kz deviates from ±k0, so that ∆e(kz) also varies with kz,
which explains the slight splitting of the resonant peaks
for diﬀerent kz slice in Fig. 2(a).

Appendix C: Semiclassical description of the
magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects

In this Section, we evaluate the saturated magnetic
ﬁeld Bc based on a semiclassical picture. As shown in Fig.
5(a), once the magnetic ﬁeld is employed, the incident
electrons in the right-moving channels will be driven by
the Lorentz force and slide along the Fermi arc. Bc is
the critical value such that all electrons incident from the
normal metal arrive the Weyl node and transfer into the
bulk Landau band before they reach the superconductor.
The semiclassical equation of motion is given by

(cid:126) ˙kz = (−e)vx × B

(C1)

here vx is the x-direction velocity. Integrating the equa-
tion on both sides yields (cid:126)∆kz = −e∆xB, which relates
the change of the momentum kz in the z direction and
the displacement ∆x in the x direction. The saturated
magnetic ﬁeld is thus given by

Bc =

(cid:126)Kz
eLx

.

Weyl node by the Lorentz force. (b) The electron trail in real
space of the critical case that the incident electrons with kz at
a Weyl node are pushed into the other Weyl node just before

energy Nk(cid:107) (0), which yields

Σsurf (k(cid:107), ω) = −ξ(ω) [ω − ∆τx] ,

ξ(ω) = |Vk(cid:107) |2πNk(cid:107) (0)(∆2 − ω2)− 1

Then we obtain the full Green’s function of the surface
states as
