ABSTRACT

We present observations and magnetic ﬁeld models of an intermediate ﬁlament present on the Sun in August 2012,
associated with a polarity inversion line that extends from AR 11541 in the east into the quiet sun at its western end.
A combination of SDO/AIA, SDO/HMI, and GONG Hα data allow us to analyse the structure and evolution of the
ﬁlament from 2012 August 4 23:00 UT to 2012 August 6 08:00 UT when the ﬁlament was in equilibrium. By applying
the ﬂux rope insertion method, nonlinear force-free ﬁeld models of the ﬁlament are constructed using SDO/HMI line-
of-sight magnetograms as the boundary condition at the two times given above. Guided by observed ﬁlament barbs,
both modelled ﬂux ropes are split into three sections each with a diﬀerent value of axial ﬂux to represent the non-
uniform photospheric ﬁeld distribution. The ﬂux in the eastern section of the rope increases by 4×1020 Mx between
the two models, which is in good agreement with the amount of ﬂux cancelled along the internal PIL of AR 11541,
calculated to be 3.2×1020 Mx. This suggests that ﬂux cancellation builds ﬂux into the ﬁlament’s magnetic structure.
Additionally, the number of ﬁeld line dips increases between the two models in the locations where ﬂux cancellation,
the formation of new ﬁlament threads and growth of the ﬁlament is observed. This suggests that ﬂux cancellation
associated with magnetic reconnection forms concave-up magnetic ﬁeld that lifts plasma into the ﬁlament. During this
time, the free magnetic energy in the models increases by 0.2×1031 ergs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Filaments are accumulations of cool, dense, partially
ionised plasma that are suspended in the solar corona
against gravity. They lie above polarity inversion lines in
the photospheric radial magnetic ﬁeld (PIL; Babcock &
Babcock 1955). This includes the PIL of active regions
(“active region ﬁlaments”), between active regions (“in-
termediate ﬁlaments”) and in the quiet sun (“quiescent
ﬁlaments”).

When observed on disk in Hα, ﬁlaments are seen to
have a main body that extends horizontally along the
structure called a spine, and barbs, which are lateral
extensions protruding from the spine at an acute angle
(e.g. Martin et al. 1992; Martin & Echols 1994; Mar-
tin 1998; Lin et al. 2008). Both of these substructures
exhibit thin threads of ﬂowing plasma that are thought
to outline the magnetic ﬁeld (Martin et al. 2008). The
spine represents the axial magnetic ﬁeld of the ﬁlament,
whereas barbs extend vertically down to the chromo-
sphere or possibly into the photosphere. Barbs can also
be used to indirectly determine the chirality of a ﬁlament
when viewed from the positive-polarity side, with left-
(right-) bearing barbs being an indication that the ﬁla-
ment has sinistral (dextral) chirality (Martin & Echols
1994).

Due to the high electrical conductivity of the corona,
and even of the relatively weakly ionised prominence
plasma, the plasma is frozen into the magnetic ﬁeld,
meaning that plasma can move freely along ﬁeld lines
but not across them. Under these conditions the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration is thought to play a major role
in supporting ﬁlament plasma against gravity. This led
Kippenhahn & Schl¨uter (1957) to suggest that dips in
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of ﬁlaments could pro-
vide locations for plasma accumulation. Since then, ﬁl-
ament models have evolved and are usually divided into
two main groups. The ﬁrst group involves a weakly-
twisted magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, known as a ﬂux
rope (Kuperus & Raadu 1974; Pneuman 1983; van Bal-
legooijen & Martens 1989), where ﬁlament material is
supported in concave-up sections of the magnetic ﬁeld.
The second group involves a sheared arcade in which
ﬁeld lines can have dips (Antiochos et al. 1994; DeVore
& Antiochos 2000). However, it has been proposed that
due to the dynamic nature of ﬁlament plasma, magnetic
dips may not be necessary for their formation (e.g. Mar-
tin & Echols 1994; Karpen et al. 2001).

In addition to understanding the speciﬁc magnetic
conﬁguration that can support ﬁlament mass, the phys-
ical processes that allow ﬁlament material to form and
accumulate must also be addressed. There are a vari-
ety of physical mechanisms that could explain the accu-

mulation of plasma. These include the emergence of a
highly-twisted ﬂux rope (Rust & Kumar 1994), U-loop
emergence (Deng et al. 2000), or magnetic reconnec-
tion associated with the observation of ﬂux cancellation
that lifts plasma into the atmosphere (van Ballegooi-
jen & Martens 1989; Litvinenko & Martin 1999; Litvi-
nenko et al. 2007; Litvinenko 2015). Also, the direct
injection of chromospheric plasma (Poland & Mariska
1986; Wang 1999; Chae et al. 2001), which is largely
motivated by the connection between ﬂux cancellation
and the formation of ﬁlament channels (van Ballegooijen
& Martens 1989; Martin 1998; Wang & Muglach 2007,
2013), and evaporation-condensation models (Engvold
& Jensen 1977; An et al. 1985; Antiochos & Klimchuk
1991; Dahlburg et al. 1998). For a more in-depth review
of the magnetic structure and dynamics of ﬁlaments see
Mackay et al. (2010).

The ﬁrst 3D magnetic models of ﬁlaments using lin-
ear force-free ﬁeld (LFFF) extrapolations of the photo-
spheric line-of-sight (LoS) magnetic ﬁeld were developed
by Aulanier & D´emoulin (1998). These magnetic models
were able to explain many observed features of Hα ﬁla-
ments, in particular, the orientation and hence chirality
patterns of the ﬁlament barbs and also the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld measurements.
In the model the barbs are
formed by concave-up dips in the magnetic ﬁeld that are
local to small-scale PILs of parasitic (minority) polari-
ties in the photosphere. These sites correspond to the
existence of ﬁeld that is tangential to the photosphere
known as “bald patches” (Titov et al. 1993). Further-
more, Aulanier et al. (1998) and Mackay & van Bal-
legooijen (2009) found that the motion of the ﬁlament
barbs corresponds to the changes of the parasitic polar-
ities. This 3D modelling of ﬁlaments supports the inter-
pretation that the plasma is supported in the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration of a ﬂux rope.

The comparison of observed photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld under ﬁlaments with coronal modelling, indicates
that ﬂux cancellation might be fundamentally important
to the formation and evolution of ﬁlaments. Flux can-
cellation is seen as small-scale opposite polarity features
that converge, collide, and subsequently disappear along
the PIL (Martin et al. 1985). The opposite-polarity fea-
tures that collide and subsequently disappear are inter-
preted as representing the footpoints of two magnetic
ﬂux systems, which become sheared across the PIL.
During collision, these features are assumed to undergo
magnetic reconnection that leads to the formation of
two magnetic ﬂux systems with a diﬀerent connectiv-
ity to the pre-reconnection pair: a small loop which is
pulled below the photosphere by magnetic tension (the
observational manifestation of ﬂux cancellation) and a

Evolution of an intermediate filament

longer, highly sheared loop that remains in the solar at-
mosphere as the ﬂux rope axis. Once a suﬃcient amount
of ﬂux has accumulated at the PIL this process starts
to build helical ﬁeld around the axis, forming the ﬂux
rope. Therefore, ongoing ﬂux cancellation associated
with the process of magnetic reconnection can transform
a sheared coronal ﬁeld into a ﬂux rope (van Ballegooijen
& Martens 1989).

The amount of ﬂux available to be built into the rope
is equal to the total amount of ﬂux cancelled. However,
the amount of ﬂux that is built into the rope may dif-
fer from the amount of ﬂux cancelled, depending upon
properties such as the amount of shear and length of the
PIL along which ﬂux cancellation is taking place (Green
et al. 2011). The concave-up sections of the ﬂux rope
that move through the dense plasma of the lower at-
mosphere not only provide locations that are capable of
supporting dense ﬁlament plasma but also allow plasma
to be pulled into the rope.

Nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) models are more
suitable than LFFF to describe the conﬁguration of the
non-potential magnetic ﬁeld of a ﬂux rope, which is held
down by an overlying potential arcade. Static NLFFF
models created at diﬀerent times during the evolution
of a region can provide its 3D magnetic ﬁeld struc-
ture, as ﬁeld lines from the models can be veriﬁed us-
ing observed plasma emission and absorption structures.
This allows us to investigate, for example, whether a
modelled ﬂux rope, and its corresponding features, are
consistent with the observations. To date, the evolu-
tion of several active regions that exhibit ﬁlaments have
been modelled applying the magnetofrictional relaxation
technique (Yang et al. 1986). This technique uses the
photospheric LoS magnetic ﬁeld as the boundary condi-
tion for the extrapolation, observations of a ﬁlament to
guide the position of an inserted ﬂux rope and EUV/X-
ray emitting loops to constrain the model.
(e.g. Bo-
bra et al. 2008; Su et al. 2009; Savcheva et al. 2012).
This method also allows certain topological features of
the magnetic ﬁeld to be studied such as the presence
of magnetic dips or bald patches, which can be com-
pared with photospheric magnetic ﬁeld and coronal ob-
servations.
It is also possible to use the magnetofric-
tional relaxation technique to construct a continuous
time-dependent series of NLFFF models by evolving the
initial coronal magnetic ﬁeld through changing the lower
boundary conditions (Mackay et al. 2011; Gibb et al.
2014; Yardley et al. 2018a, 2019). Another set of stud-
ies invoke a more general method to create static models
of ﬂux ropes in active regions by using the photospheric
vector magnetic ﬁeld to constrain the NLFFF models
(e.g. R´egnier et al. 2002; Schrijver et al. 2006; Canou &

Amari 2010; Guo et al. 2016). The signatures of mag-
netic dips have also been observed in vector magnetic
ﬁeld data as bald patches, where the magnetic ﬁeld is
tangent to the photosphere and crosses the PIL in the
inverse direction (Lites et al. 2005; L´opez Ariste et al.
2006; Okamoto et al. 2008; Yardley et al. 2016). That
said, both these methods are aﬀected by uncertainties
in the direction of the transverse ﬁeld due to the 180◦
ambiguity and so bald patches must be spatially and
temporally coherent.

These previous NLFFF studies have all focused on
modelling active region ﬁlaments, which are reasonably
compact and located along PILs in a strong magnetic
ﬁeld distribution. In active regions the transverse com-
ponent of the ﬁeld normally exceeds the level of noise as-
sociated with this ﬁeld component. This is not necessar-
ily the case for observations of the transverse component
in the quiet sun. Therefore, to study the magnetic struc-
ture of ﬁlaments outside active regions NLFFF models
that require only the LoS photospheric magnetic ﬁeld,
due to its lower noise values, can be used. For example,
Su & van Ballegooijen (2012) used the ﬂux rope insertion
method to model a polar crown ﬁlament as this method
relies only on the LoS magnetic ﬁeld component. In a
more recent study Jiang et al. (2014) utilized the vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation technique to model the
coronal ﬂux rope of a large-scale intermediate ﬁlament
located between an active region and a weak ﬁeld region.
The study successfully managed to match the magnetic
dips in a ﬂux rope to observations of the ﬁlament and
its barbs.

In this paper we present the study of an intermediate
ﬁlament that was observed on the Sun during August
2012. We model the magnetic ﬁeld of the ﬁlament at
two diﬀerent times using the ﬂux rope insertion method
(van Ballegooijen 2004) and compare these models to
photospheric, chromospheric and coronal observations.
This is the ﬁrst time the ﬂux rope insertion method has
been used to model a ﬁlament of this nature. The in-
termediate ﬁlament has its eastern end anchored along
the internal PIL of AR 11451, which is situated in an
active region complex (ARs 11538–11541) and the west-
ern end positioned in the quiet sun. In order to further
our understanding of the physical processes and mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration responsible for the formation
and support of ﬁlament plasma a comparison is made
between the observations and NLFFF models over a 33
hour time period. A NLFFF model is constructed at
both the start and end of this time period, allowing us
to investigate the locations of dips in the modelled ﬁeld,
the ﬂux content of the magnetic structure of the ﬁlament
and the variation of these properties with time. These

are compared with the sites of ﬂux cancellation and the
evolution of the ﬁlament plasma distribution.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives
details on the instrumentation used and the algorithm
application for observational analysis of ﬂux cancella-
tion. Section 3 describes the photospheric ﬁeld distri-
bution and chromospheric and coronal observations of
the intermediate ﬁlament.
In Section 4 details of the
ﬂux rope insertion method, used to construct the two
NLFFF models, are given. Section 5 provides the re-
sults and the comparison of the observations with the
NLFFF models. Finally, the results are discussed and
the conclusions are given in Section 6.

2. INSTRUMENTATION & ALGORITHM

APPLICATION

2.1. Instrumentation

The evolution of the intermediate ﬁlament and the
associated photospheric magnetic ﬁeld are analyzed in
detail during the period 2012 August 4–6 using a wide
range of space-borne and ground-based instrumentation.
A brief description of the data used is now given.

Data taken by the Extreme UltraViolet Imager on
board the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-B
(STEREO-B/EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004; Howard et al.
2008) are used to calculate the height of the ﬁlament
when it is seen at the west limb from the STEREO-B
viewpoint. At this time the ﬁlament is near Sun-centre
from the AIA perspective. The evolution and dynam-
ics of the ﬁlament plasma are studied during its disk
passage using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). AIA provides obser-
vations of multi-temperature plasma, which allows us
to investigate the plasma evolution in the chromosphere
and corona with respect to changes in the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, we focus on observing the
plasma evolution in the 171, 193, 211 and 304 ˚A wave-
bands, which are dominated by plasma temperatures
around 0.6 MK, a combination of 1.2 and 20 MK, 2 MK
and 0.05 MK, respectively. Hα images taken from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG; Harvey et
al. 2011) are also used to study the ﬁlament evolution
and the orientation of its barbs to determine the chi-
rality sign of the ﬁlament. The evolution of the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld is analyzed using full disk LoS
magnetogram data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board SDO. In this
study, we focus on analyzing observations of the ﬁla-
ment during the time period beginning 2012 August 4 at
23:00 UT until 2012 August 6 at 08:00 UT when the ﬁla-
ment remains in equilibrium. However, to constrain the

magnetic ﬁeld models we use observations taken when
the ﬁlament is activated as during these times heated
plasma reveals important information about the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration. The occurrence and timings
of the CMEs associated with the ﬁlament are deter-
mined from observations made by the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO, Brueckner et al.
1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995). Filament activations and
eruptions have been previously studied by Li & Zhang
(2013); Srivastava et al. (2013); Joshi et al. (2014).

2.2. Algorithm Application

The photospheric ﬁeld evolution of AR 11541 and
the quiet sun photosphere above which the ﬁlament re-
sides is studied using the HMI 720 s cadence data series
(Hoeksema et al. 2014; Couvidat et al. 2016). The ﬂux
cancellation is quantiﬁed by using the Solar Tracking of
the Evolution of photospheric Flux (STEF) algorithm,
the discussion of which can be found in Yardley et al.
(2016, 2018b). Once the region for analysis is identiﬁed
the radial component of the magnetic ﬁeld is estimated
by applying a cosine correction using the Heliocentric
Earth Equatorial (HEEQ) coordinate system (Thomp-
son 2006). The radialised ﬁeld data are then diﬀeren-
tially rotated to the central meridian passage time us-
ing a routine that corrects for area foreshortening. For
this particular case no smoothing is applied and pixels
are selected with magnetic ﬂux density values above a
threshold of 3σ, where σ is the noise in the LoS mag-
netic ﬁeld, which is 10 G for HMI. No smoothing and a
low threshold is applied to the data in this case as the
ﬁeld of the decayed active region and the quiet sun is
quite dispersed. Due to the dispersed nature of the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld along the ﬁlament, even in the
active region section, a second criterion is applied. That
is, magnetic fragments must be 4 HMI pixels or larger
to be selected for measurement to avoid false detections.
Once this process is completed the total magnetic ﬂux is
calculated from the selected pixels. Only ﬂux cancella-
tion occurring in AR 11541 is quantiﬁed, by calculating
the reduction in the total positive magnetic ﬂux in the
active region since the negative magnetic ﬂux is more
dispersed and diﬃcult to measure. Flux cancellation
sites are identiﬁed along the section of the ﬁlament that
extends into the quiet sun, but the diﬃculty of linking
a ﬂux cancellation event with the magnetic structure of
the ﬁlament precludes a quantitative analysis. To sepa-
rate out the diﬀerent ﬂux cancellation sites for both the
ARs and quiet sun a mask was applied to the magne-
tograms.

3. OBSERVATIONS

Evolution of an intermediate filament

5

On 2012 August 4 at approximately 11:12 UT the ﬁla-
ment becomes activated in response to the eruption of a
structure overlying the ﬁlament’s eastern section in AR
11541. Double coronal dimmings, which are an indica-
tion of the footpoints of the erupting magnetic conﬁg-
uration, are observed to be situated over the magnetic
polarities of AR 11541, either side of the ﬂare arcade
(Figure 2 (a)). The interaction between the erupting
structure and the ﬁlament leads to the perturbation and
heating of the ﬁlament, revealing plasma that follows
helical magnetic ﬁeld lines. The presence of ﬁne heli-
cal plasma threads suggests that the ﬁlament plasma
is supported in a ﬂux rope conﬁguration. The right-
handed twist of the plasma threads is consistent with
a ﬂux rope of positive chirality. The eruption, which is
associated with a GOES C3.5 class ﬂare, is observed
by SOHO/LASCO C2 at around 12:48 UT and also
by STEREO-B/SECCHI COR1 (13:35 UT) and COR2
(14:24 UT). A more detailed study of the eruption and
its impact on the ﬁlament is presented by Joshi et al.
(2014). The ﬁlament is stable again by 17:00 UT on
August 4. On August 6 at approximately 08:30 UT the
middle section of the ﬁlament activates and the western
end begins to rise around 12:45 UT. Fine threads of ﬂux
rope plasma become heated during this period reveal-
ing helical threads in the central section of the ﬁlament
(Figure 2 (b)). A fraction of the ﬁlament material ap-
pears to lift oﬀ slowly at the western end from around
14:00 UT. There is a C1.1 GOES class ﬂare at 19:50 UT
in AR 11541, which is associated with a faint, slow CME
visible in LASCO/C2 at 20:24 UT.

The majority of the ﬁlament barbs, identiﬁed in the
Hα data, are left-bearing indicating that the ﬁlament
has sinistral chirality, which is typical for the southern
hemisphere and is in agreement with Joshi et al. (2014).
The height of the ﬁlament plasma is estimated using
STEREO-B, which is positioned at 114.8◦ away from the
Sun-Earth line, trailing the Earth. The central section
of the ﬁlament is seen to be suspended directly above
the west limb from the STEREO-B perspective. The
height of the plasma is measured at the time of the ﬁrst
NLFFF model (2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT). The ﬁl-
ament plasma spans a range of heights from approxi-
mately 7 Mm to 47 Mm above the photosphere.

The ﬁlament is seen to exhibit plasma ﬂows both along
and perpendicular to its spine. These ﬂows are best ob-
served in the 304 ˚A waveband of AIA and are concen-
trated in the eastern section of the ﬁlament that over-
lies the PIL of the active region. These include counter-
streaming ﬂows that are most apparent on August 5 and
6. The ﬁlament is also observed to have grown in size
between August 4 23:00 UT and August 6 08:00 UT. In

Figure 1. Hα image from the GONG Network shows the
ﬁlament and locations of the four ARs in the AR complex
(ARs 11538–11541), which have been labelled in blue. The
corresponding SDO/HMI magnetogram has been overlaid on
the image where white (black) contours represent the positive
(negative) magnetic ﬁeld with saturation levels of ±100 G.

3.1. Photospheric Field & Filament Evolution

The ﬁlament initially forms during Carrington Ro-
tation (CR) 2125, remains intact until it rotates back
onto the disk during CR 2126 on 2012 August 1, and
makes its ﬁnal appearance during CR 2127 when it ﬁ-
nally erupts on 2012 August 31. During its lifetime there
are four eruptions: two eruptions that lead to the desta-
bilization of the ﬁlament and two eruptions which re-
sult in the ejection of ﬁlament material. In this study
we concentrate on analyzing observational data taken
during CR 2126, in particular, a time period after one
of the eruptions when the ﬁlament is stable beginning
on 2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT until 2012 August 6 at
08:00 UT, after which the ﬁlament gets destabilized and
erupts again. This enables us to study the ﬁlament evo-
lution and associated ﬂux cancellation during a quiet
period.

The eastern end of the ﬁlament is rooted in an AR
complex that includes decayed regions (AR 11519, 11520
and 11521) from the previous rotation (CR 2125) and
a new region that emerged on the far-side. These four
ARs are numbered: 11538, 11539, 11540 and 11541 (in
CR 2126). The ﬁlament exists along a PIL that begins
in the western section of AR 11541 and extends into the
quiet sun (Figure 1).

The two eruptions that act to destabilize the ﬁlament
are described below as the EUV observations taken dur-
ing these times (see Figure 2) are used to constrain the
NLFFF models of the ﬁlament.

(MGN) technique of Morgan & Druckm¨uller (2014). Panel (a): The ﬁlament (indicated by the black arrow) is perturbed by
the erupting structure in the south east. The corresponding coronal dimmings have been labelled with blue arrows. Panel (b):
The ﬁlament becomes activated for a second time. The white arrows in both panels indicate the ﬁne, helical threads that show
the ﬁlament is supported by a twisted structure. An animation of this ﬁgure is available online.

particular, the extension of the ﬁlament’s western end
towards AR 11538 is notable (see white arrow in Fig-
ure 3 (b) and the blue arrows in Figure 3 (d)). There
are also more ﬁlamentary threads present (blue arrows
in Figure 3 (d)) along and perpendicular to the internal
PIL of AR 11541.

3.2. Flux Cancellation

The photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data show that there
are ﬂux cancellation sites along the full length of the ﬁl-
ament throughout the time period studied (2012 August
4 23:00 UT – 2012 August 6 08:00 UT); both along the
internal PIL of AR 11541 and in the quiet sun. There are
also ﬂux cancellation events in the immediate surround-
ing area of the ﬁlament channel. The ﬂux cancellation
sites are shown in Figure 4; these sites are more abun-
dant in the quiet sun than in the AR due to the spatial
extent of the ﬁlament.

In the quiet sun, ﬂux emergence and cancellation were
observed to occur every few hours and there was no over-
all trend in the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld. Flux can-
cellation in the quiet sun has not been quantiﬁed in this
study due to the diﬃculties in identifying which cancel-
lation events are connected to the ﬁlament’s magnetic
structure. However, there were a total of 12 cancella-
tion sites spanning an area of 5000 Mm2 underneath the
western section of the ﬁlament (white box in Figure 4).
The location of these cancellation sites corresponds to
a section of the ﬁlament that grows in size as seen in
the Hα and AIA observations (white arrow in top-right
panel of Figure 3).

There are two main regions of ongoing ﬂux cancella-
tion located at the internal PIL of AR 11541. These two

regions are indicated by blue and yellow boxes in Fig-
ure 4 and are referred to as sites 1 and 2, respectively.
To calculate the quantity of ﬂux cancelled in these two
locations over the time period studied (2012 August 4
23:00 UT until 2012 August 6 08:00 UT) the STEF al-
gorithm was applied. The quiet sun method was used
due to the very dispersed and fragmented nature of the
active region ﬁeld (see Section 2.2). It was not possible
to isolate and determine the boundary of the negative
polarity in this case so the amount of ﬂux cancelled was
calculated using the reduction in the total positive mag-
netic ﬂux only. The total positive ﬂux cancelled was
calculated separately in sites 1 and 2.
In addition to
ﬂux cancellation, a ﬂux emergence episode occurred on
August 5 between 14:00 UT and 15:48 UT at site 1 and
on August 6 between 05:00 UT and 08:00 UT at site 2.
These ﬂux emergence events act to mask the ﬂux can-
cellation occurring along the internal PIL of AR 11541.
Therefore, the positive magnetic ﬂux of the two emer-
gence episodes are subtracted from the total positive
ﬂux. The amount of ﬂux cancellation that occurred at
sites 1 and 2 during the time period studied is 1.4 and
1.8 × 1020 Mx, respectively. Therefore, the total ﬂux
cancelled is 3.2 × 1020 Mx. This gives an average ﬂux

4. THE NLFFF MODEL

To study the 3D magnetic structure that supports the
ﬁlament plasma we require the construction of coronal
magnetic ﬁeld models. This is due to the diﬃculty of
directly measuring the coronal magnetic ﬁeld and the
presence of projection eﬀects due to the contributions of

multiple plasma structures along the line of sight in an
optically thin plasma.

In this section, we discuss the construction of 3D
NLFFF models of the intermediate ﬁlament at the start
and end of our time period of study. We compare
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of the models to the
SDO/AIA and HMI observations to determine the two
“best-ﬁt” models; one on 2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT and
the other on 2012 August 6 at 08:00 UT. These mod-
els are then used for subsequent analysis. In particular,
the models are used to investigate the magnetic conﬁg-
uration of the ﬁlament. The models are also used to
determine whether the observed ﬂux cancellation sites
correspond to the location of dips in the modelled ﬁeld,
and whether their evolution from the ﬁrst model to the
second is as expected considering the ﬂux cancellation
scenario.

4.1. Flux Rope Insertion Method

Filaments exist in sheared and possibly twisted ﬁeld
conﬁgurations that are constrained by the overlying
coronal magnetic ﬁeld and as such are best described

by NLFFF models. The magnetic ﬁeld B, of this con-
ﬁguration is given by the force-free criterion that can be
derived from Amp´ere’s Law: ∇ × B ≈ α(r)B(r), where
the torsion parameter α, is constant along ﬁeld lines but
can vary as a function of position (i.e. ﬁeld lines can
have diﬀerent values of α). To model the non-potential
coronal magnetic ﬁeld we use the ﬂux rope insertion
method (van Ballegooijen 2004). Magnetic models are
constructed by inserting a weakly-twisted ﬂux rope (typ-
ically 1–1.5 turns) into a potential ﬁeld extrapolation of
the region. The potential ﬁeld is constructed by apply-
ing the potential force source surface (PFSS) model us-
ing line-of-sight magnetograms taken by SDO/HMI as
the lower boundary condition. For the computational
domain where the ﬂux rope is inserted we use a high-
resolution HMI magnetogram taken at the time of the
two models (2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT and 2012 Au-
gust 6 at 08:00 UT). We use a synoptic magnetogram
from Carrington Rotation (CR) 2126 to construct the
low-resolution global potential ﬁeld that provides the
side boundary conditions for the high-resolution domain.
The method uses a staggered grid to ensure second or-

der accuracy and to satisfy the solenoidal condition.
The ﬂux rope insertion method has been previously de-
scribed in detail in papers such as Savcheva et al. (2012)
and Su & van Ballegooijen (2012), where it has been
used to model sigmoids, active region and quiescent ﬁl-
aments. This is the ﬁrst time the method has been used
to model an intermediate ﬁlament.

The potential magnetic ﬁeld model is modiﬁed by cre-
ating a cavity above and along the ﬁlament’s path as de-
termined from the 304 ˚A AIA observations of ﬁlament
plasma. The axial ﬁeld of a ﬂux rope is inserted into this
cavity. Poloidal ﬁeld is introduced by inserting a set of
closed ﬁeld lines that wrap around the axial ﬁeld. This
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is not in equilibrium and so
needs to be relaxed in order to reach a force-free equi-
librium. This is achieved by applying magnetofrictional
relaxation (Yang et al. 1986) along with hyperdiﬀusion
(Boozer 1986; Bhattacharjee & Hameiri 1986). During
the initial stages of relaxation resistive diﬀusion is used
to merge the axial and poloidal ﬁelds of the ﬂux rope
together. The coronal ﬁeld is then evolved using the in-
duction equation, and the ﬂux rope to expands until the
magnetic tension of the overlying arcade balances the
magnetic pressure associated with the ﬂux rope. A small
amount of hyperdiﬀusion is used to smooth out gradients

in the force-free parameter while conserving magnetic
helicity. This is an iterative process and we perform at
least 30,000 iterations for each ﬂux rope model.

5. MODEL RESULTS & COMPARISON WITH

OBSERVATIONS

We computed 26 models for each of the times 2012
August 4 at 23:00 UT and 2012 August 6 at 08:00 UT.
The models have been constructed by inserting ﬂux
ropes with diﬀerent combinations of of axial and poloidal
ﬂuxes in the ranges [0.5 ×1020, 1 × 1021] Mx and
[5 × 108, 1 ×1010] Mx cm−1, respectively. Figure 5
shows the ﬁlament paths for the ﬁrst and second set
of ﬂux rope models. The inserted ﬂux rope has right-
handed twist in accordance with the sinistral chirality of
the ﬁlament, as the majority of the ﬁlament barbs are
seen to be left-bearing in the observations (see Figure 1
and Section 3.1). The eastern footpoint of the ﬁlament is
rooted in the negative polarity of AR 11541 whereas, the
western end resides in the positive polarity of AR 11538.
Therefore, the axial ﬁeld of the ﬂux rope points to the
east. The eastern section of the ﬁlament is located in a
region of stronger photospheric magnetic ﬁeld compared
to the western section therefore, the ﬂux along the ﬁla-
ment is likely to be non-uniform. This is reﬂected in the

and the 304 ˚A images have been enhanced using the MGN technique. The red curves represent the path along which the ﬂux
rope is inserted into the model. The path is divided into three sections: east, central and west as determined by the locations
of the two main barbs of the ﬁlament (yellow bars in the top panel). The ﬁrst section is at the eastern end where the ﬂux rope
is rooted in the negative polarity of AR 11541, the middle section is between the two barbs and the ﬁnal section is between the
second barb and the end rooted in the positive polarity of AR 11538. Each section has a diﬀerent value of axial ﬂux, which is
given in Table 1.

construction of the NLFFF models, which involves three
sections each containing a diﬀerent value of axial ﬂux in
order to keep the ﬁlament in equilibrium. These sections
are constrained by the two main ﬁlament barbs that are
represented by the yellow bars in Figure 5. These sec-
tions are referred to as the eastern, central and western
sections.

5.1. Best-ﬁt Models

Once the NLFFF models are constructed, AIA ob-
servations are used to select the “best-ﬁt” model at
each model time. Sample magnetic ﬁeld lines from each
model are selected and compared with AIA observations
of the ﬁlament. The sample ﬁeld lines were compared
to the ﬁne helical plasma threads, which are visible in

193 ˚A during the time when the ﬁlament becomes acti-
vated (on August 4 between ∼12:00 and 15:00 UT, see
Figure 2 and Section 3.1). In addition, plasma ﬂows ob-
served at the eastern end of the ﬁlament in 304 ˚A were
also used to identify aspects of the magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration and help constrain the models. Finally, the
chosen models had to possess coherent magnetic dips
that overlay the axis of the ﬂux rope. We note that the
AIA 193 ˚A observations used to select the best-ﬁt mod-
els are taken during a time period when the ﬁlament
is not in equilibrium. This approach was necessary as
there were no overlying loops visible in the X-ray or
EUV data that could be used to constrain the models
during the phase where the ﬁlament is in equilibrium.
The models are produced roughly 12 hours following and

6 hours preceding ﬁlament activation events caused by
eruptions occurring in AR 11541.

Table 1 gives the approximate values of axial ﬂux of
the three diﬀerent sections of the ﬂux rope (from east
to west) for the two best-ﬁt models. Both of the best-ﬁt
models have a poloidal ﬂux of 5 ×108 Mx cm−1. The ax-
ial ﬂux in the eastern section of the ﬂux rope increases by
4 × 1020 Mx from the time of the ﬁrst NLFFF model to
the time of the second model. This is comparable to the
total amount of ﬂux cancelled, as determined from ob-
servations, of 3.2 × 1020 Mx. Therefore, we ﬁnd consis-
tency between the NLFFF models and the photospheric
evolution. free magnetic energy also increases from 8.8
×1031 ergs in model 1 to 1×1032 ergs in model 2, which
is suﬃcient to power the eruption that occurs roughly
12 hours after model 2.

Figure 6 shows sample ﬁeld lines taken from the best-
ﬁt magnetic models. The ﬁeld lines in model 1 are rel-
atively twisted and conﬁned along the PIL of AR 11541
whereas, in the quiet sun region that extends towards
AR 11538, the ﬁeld lines appear less twisted. The ﬁeld
lines along the internal PIL of AR 11541 connect across
the two main sites of ﬂux cancellation. Conversely, in
model 2 the ﬁeld lines are more continuous, especially
along the PIL of AR 11541 and at the western end that
extends towards AR 11538. This is consistent with the
evolution of the ﬁlament in 304 ˚A where ﬂows are seen
along the eastern end and the ﬁlament at the western
end grows in length. Sample ﬁeld lines plotted in the x-z
plane show that a bald patch topology present in both
of the modelled ﬂux ropes (see Figure 7).

in the cell volume in model 2 compared to model 1,
however, the dips that remain are concentrated along
the PIL underneath the ﬁlament plasma. There is a
change in the location of dips at the western end of the
ﬁlament in the quiet sun, where the ﬁlament is observed
to have accumulated more plasma, as seen in Hα and
304 ˚A (Figure 3 and 4) and ﬂux cancellation has taken
place. The dips along the ﬁlament spine appear to be
fragmented due to line-of-sight eﬀects and the fact that
the dips are only plotted between the heights of 4 and
6 Mm.

5.3. Current Distribution

Figures 9 and 10 show the current density maps of the
two NLFFF models at diﬀerent locations along each ﬂux
rope. In both models it is evident that the ﬂux rope has
a complex structure and in the western end of the rope
the current is concentrated in the outer layers of the
rope. The distribution of current of the eastern section
of the ﬂux rope, which is located in the AR, is very com-
pact whereas the middle and western sections that are
located in the quiet sun are very broad. The “knee” in
the eastern section of the ﬁlament, that is present in the
observations, is also visible in the current distribution
(arrows in Figure 9 and Figure 10). In Figure 10, which
shows model 2, the current distribution is enhanced in
the western end compared to the previous model. This
is consistent with the growth in the ﬁlament and the
location of a large number of ﬂux cancellation sites in
the quiet sun in the observations (orange arrow in Fig-
ure 10).

5.2. Location of Modelled Dips

6. SUMMARY & DISCUSSION

One aim of constructing the NLFFF models is to in-
vestigate whether the location of magnetic dips is con-
sistent with the observed ﬂux cancellation sites and how
these both evolve over the time period between the ﬁrst
model to the second. The location of the dips in the
modelled magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Figure 8. Dips at
a height of 4 and 6 Mm are plotted in light blue and
blue, respectively. These dips are lower than the alti-
tude of the lowest observed ﬁlament plasma, which is
estimated from the observations to be 7 Mm. Magnetic
dips at heights lower than the ﬁlament were chosen in
order to investigate whether they correspond to the ﬂux
cancellation sites in the observations. These concave-up
sections of magnetic ﬁeld may be sites where ﬁlament
plasma eventually accumulates.

The dips are observed along the PIL at the locations
of the ﬁlament material and the surrounding ﬂux rope
with the dips being more broadly distributed in area in
the quiet sun. There are fewer magnetic dips present

We present an analysis of an intermediate ﬁlament,
from both an observational and a modelling perspective.
The intermediate ﬁlament was located along a photo-
spheric PIL that at the western end was rooted in the
periphery of the positive polarity of AR 11538, extended
through a quiet sun region, and ended in the negative
polarity of AR 11541. Photospheric and atmospheric ob-
servations over a 33 hour time period were analyzed and
supplemented by NLFFF models that were constructed
at the start and end of this time period. The aim of
the analysis is to investigate the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration that supports the ﬁlament plasma and probe the
physical processes that underlie the formation and evo-
lution of ﬁlaments.
In particular, we ask whether the
process known as ﬂux cancellation plays an important
role in the ﬁlaments evolution.

The ﬁlament formed in the southern hemisphere and
was determined to be of sinistral chirality from the ori-
entation of its barbs as seen in Hα observations. This

is in agreement with the study of this ﬁlament by Joshi
et al. (2014) and is typical for southern hemisphere ﬁl-
aments in general. The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of
the ﬁlament was investigated through the construction
of NLFFF models on 2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT and
on 2012 August 6 at 08:00 UT. The models were created
using the ﬂux rope insertion method (van Ballegooijen
2004), which utilizes observations of a ﬁlament to guide
the insertion of a weakly-twisted ﬂux rope into a poten-
tial ﬁeld extrapolation that is created using the LoS pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld as the boundary condition. The
modelled ﬁeld is then relaxed to remove Lorentz forces.
The axial and poloidal ﬂux of the ﬂux rope can be varied
so that the relaxed magnetic ﬁeld lines are seen to match
observed plasma emission structures. The magnetic ﬁeld
environment of the intermediate ﬁlament studied here
(involving active region and quiet sun ﬁeld) resulted in
the modelled ﬂux rope being composed of three sections,
each with varying axial ﬂux. These sections are referred
to as the eastern, central and western sections and will
be discussed more later. The two ﬂux rope models, val-
idated against observations, suggest that the ﬁlament

plasma was supported by a weakly-twisted ﬂux rope,
which had right handed twist in line with its sinistral
categorization.

Validating the NLFFF models for this intermediate
ﬁlament was challenging. The extension of the ﬁlament,
and its associated channel that is dark in EUV, into the
quiet sun provides few plasma emission structures that
can be used to select the modelled ﬁeld conﬁguration
that best matches the observed coronal loops. To over-
come this challenge we use EUV observations at times
close to, but not the same as, the times of the NLFFF
model. In particular we utilize times when the ﬁlament
was activated approximately 12 hours before the ﬁrst
NLFFF model and 6 hours after the second NLFFF
model. At these times ﬁne threads of plasma become
heated, revealing the global structure of the ﬁlament.

Given the ﬂux rope magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration we
now discuss the position of magnetic dips in the NLFFF
models and the sites of ﬂux cancellation. Dips in the
modelled ﬁeld at a relatively low altitude of 4 and 6 Mm
were investigated, with a focus on whether there is an
overall change in the distribution of dips between the

modelled ﬂux ropes.

Sample magnetic ﬁeld lines from models 1 and 2 plotted in the x-z plane to show the magnetic topology of the

ﬁrst and second NLFFF models. Overall, the dips in
the modelled ﬁeld are seen to be concentrated along the
photospheric PIL in both models, where it is presumed
that ﬂux cancellation has taken place prior to the time
period of this study. Comparing the ﬁrst NLFFF model
to the second model allows us to investigate the diﬀer-
ence in the magnetic ﬁeld over time and reveals that
the number of dips in the cell volume decreases from
the ﬁrst to the second model. However, the dips that
remain are concentrated along the PIL underneath the
ﬁlament plasma.

There is a reduction in the number of ﬁeld line dips
in the region that corresponds to sites of ﬂux cancella-
tion away from the PIL, for example, in the quiet sun
region on the ﬁlament’s northern side. Flux cancellation
in these locations presumably involves smaller-scale ﬂux
systems, that do not themselves build into the main ﬁl-
ament magnetic structure and do not contribute axial
ﬁeld. It may be that in these locations dips are short-
lived, or they may be created at diﬀerent altitudes to
the ones that we study. The results presented here em-
phasis the importance of ongoing ﬂux cancellation at the
same PIL to build up the non-potential structure that
supports the ﬁlament plasma, which in this study forms
a ﬂux rope.

The ﬂux cancellation sites that occur close to the po-
larity inversion line are concentrated at the eastern and
western ends of the ﬁlament, in active region and de-
cayed ﬁeld regions respectively. The ﬂux cancellation
that occurred along the internal PIL of AR 11541, at

the ﬁlaments eastern end, was quantiﬁed by measuring
the reduction in total positive magnetic ﬂux during the
time period beginning 2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT until
2012 August 6 at 08:00 UT. This time period coincides
with the time when the ﬁlament was close to central
meridian, meaning that our results are unaﬀected by
HMI instrument sensitivity issues that cause peaks in
the line of sight ﬁeld for ﬂux measured at a centre-to-
limb angle of 60◦ (Hoeksema et al. 2014; Couvidat et al.
2016). The geosynchronous orbit of SDO also introduces
a time-varying systematic error in the ﬂux that mani-
fests itself as superimposed sinusoidal oscillations with
periods of 12 and 24 hours (Hoeksema et al. 2014), com-
pared to our time period of study of 33 hours. Overall,
the total positive ﬂux cancelled along the internal PIL
of AR 11541 was calculated to be 3.2 × 1020 Mx. This
is in fairly good agreement with the increase in ﬂux in
the eastern section of the modelled ﬂux rope, which was
found to be 4×1020 Mx.

It was not possible to quantify the amount of ﬂux
cancelled in the western section of the ﬂux rope due to
the large quantity and small size of the fragments there.
However, the growth of the western section of the ﬁla-
ment does correspond to an area in the quiet sun where
a large number of ﬂux cancellation sites are observed
(12 sites in ∼5000 Mm2) and an increase in the size
of the ﬁlament is observed. Li & Zhang (2013) were
able to measure the magnetic ﬂux at the footpoints of
ﬁne-scale structures that are part of the western end
of the ﬂux rope at the time of the ﬁlament activation

at around 12:56 UT on 2012 August 4. The footpoints
of the ﬁne-scale structures have values of magnetic ﬂux
ranging from 1.1 × 1019 Mx to 8.1 × 1019 Mx, and Li
& Zhang (2013) deduced that the ﬂux rope contains at
least 7.6 × 1020 Mx. The NLFFF model on this day
suggests a lower value of total ﬂux of 0.5×1020 Mx con-
tained in the western end of the ﬂux rope, which is an
order of magnitude less than Li & Zhang (2013). This
is due to the model containing three sections that are
joined to create one ﬂux rope. If we insert one ﬂux rope
into the model then the ﬂux rope is no longer in equi-
librium, which does not reﬂect the ﬁlament seen in the
observations. The NLFFF model on August 6 contains
a larger amount of ﬂux in all sections of the ﬂux rope.
This suggests that the cancellation of ﬂux builds ﬂux
into the ﬂux rope. These observations are consistent
with the previous studies of Liu et al. (2012); Zhang et
al. (2014); Yardley et al. (2016), where dense ﬁlamen-
tary threads build into a ﬁlament through the process
of reconnection that is associated with ﬂux cancellation.

Whilst the evolution of the axial ﬁeld of the modelled
ﬂux rope bears close correspondence with the observed
ﬂux cancellation, the poloidal ﬂux does not change be-
tween the models. This is driven by the observations
that show no support for the structure becoming more
twisted with time. Although ﬂux cancellation builds
axial ﬂux into the rope, it doesn’t necessarily increase
the poloidal ﬂux. It depends on the details of how the
ﬂux cancellation proceeds. For details see Green et al.
(2011).

The height range of plasma in the central section of
the ﬁlament was measured to be between 7 and 46 Mm
using observations from STEREO-B, which was close
to being in quadrature at the time of this study. This
height range is higher than the dips in the ﬁeld that
we investigate using the NLFFF models. However, the
close spatial correspondence of the dipped ﬁeld, ﬂux can-
cellation and the ﬁlament plasma locations as seen from
above is still consistent with the plasma being supported
in dips in the ﬁeld that were created as a result of ﬂux
cancellation. The NLFFF models allow us to probe in

more detail the overall height and extent of the ﬂux
rope at the start and end of our time period of inter-
est. Over the 33 hours from the time of the ﬁrst model
to the second, all three sections of the modelled rope
show an increase in altitude with the rise being most
pronounced in the central and western sections. This
is consistent with the observations that show the erup-
tion of the western end of the ﬁlament occurs ∼6 hours
after the second NLFFF model and causes part of the
ﬁlament and supporting structure to rise and become
destabilized.

The modelling results in our work are consistent with
the observations that show that the eventual eruption of

the ﬁlament initiates in the western (quiet sun) section.
In the western section the magnetic structure is evolv-
ing due to ﬂux cancellation and, as indicated from the
modelling, the axial ﬂux doubles in size accompanied
by a rise of the structure. Both the ﬂux cancellation,
which will add axial ﬂux to the rope, and the rise of
the structure are consistent with the eventual eruption
of the ﬁlament. The lack of helical deformation of the
ﬁlament in the observations in the lead up to eruption
along with the low values of poloidal ﬂux in the NLFFF
models leads us to believe that the eruption is not due
to the kink instability (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005). The on-
set of eruption is therefore most likely caused by the

slow rise of the ﬁlament to a height at which the gradi-
ent of the magnetic ﬁeld overlying the ﬁlament decays
rapidly enough with height for the torus instability to
occur (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010;
Kliem et al. 2013).

In summary, observations of an intermediate ﬁlament
were analyzed and compared to the NLFFF models con-
structed using the ﬂux rope insertion method. The lo-
cation and evolution of plasma distribution, sites of ﬂux
cancellation and magnetic dips in the NLFFF models
were found to be in agreement. In addition, the total
ﬂux cancelled as calculated from the HMI observations
was comparable to the change in axial ﬂux between the
NLFFF models. Finally, there was an increase in the
free magnetic energy 0.2×1031 ergs between the NLFFF
models. Therefore, these results are consistent with ﬂux

cancellation and associated reconnection lifting plasma
into a forming or growing ﬂux rope, lengthening the pre-
existing ﬁlament and producing ﬂows along the ﬁlament
that originate from the ﬂux cancellation sites.
