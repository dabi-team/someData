Abstract

images and line-of-sight magnetograms from the Solar Dynamics
Earlier studies using extreme-ultraviolet
Observatory (SDO) have suggested that active region (AR) plages and strong network concentrations often have
looplike features embedded within them, even though no minority-polarity ﬂux is visible in the
small,
corresponding magnetograms. Because of the unexpected nature of these ﬁndings, we have searched the SDO
database for examples of inverted-Y structures rooted inside “unipolar” plages, with such jetlike structures being
interpreted as evidence for magnetic reconnection between small bipoles and the dominant-polarity ﬁeld. Several
illustrative cases are presented from the period of 2013–2015, all of which are associated with transient outﬂows
from AR “moss.” The triangular or dome-shaped bases have horizontal dimensions of ∼2–4 Mm, corresponding to
∼1–3 granular diameters. We also note that the spongy-textured Fe IX 17.1 nm moss is not conﬁned to plages, but
may extend into regions where the photospheric ﬁeld is relatively weak or even has mixed polarity. We again ﬁnd a
tendency for bright coronal loops seen in the 17.1, 19.3, and 21.1 nm passbands to show looplike ﬁne structure and
their footpoints. These observations provide further conﬁrmation that present-day
compact brightenings at
magnetograms are signiﬁcantly underrepresenting the amount of minority-polarity ﬂux inside AR plages and again
suggest that footpoint reconnection and small-scale ﬂux cancellation may play a major role in coronal heating, both
inside and outside ARs.

1. Introduction

In a now widely favored model for the heating of coronal
loops, random convective motions lead to the formation of
current sheets in the overlying magnetic ﬁeld, where the energy
is then dissipated locally (see, e.g., Parker 1988; Galsgaard &
Nordlund 1996; Dahlburg et al. 2016). In an alternative (but not
necessarily mutually exclusive) scenario,
loops
reconnect with small-scale ﬁelds at their footpoints, with the
dissipated energy being transmitted to greater heights via
chromospheric evaporation and magnetohyrodynamic waves
(see, e.g., Priest et al. 2018; Syntelis et al. 2019). A list of
arguments in favor of the latter view has been given by
Aschwanden et al. (2007).

the coronal

In the case of the active region (AR) corona, a strong
argument against footpoint heating is that the plage areas in
which the AR loops are embedded generally contain almost no
minority-polarity ﬂux, according to even high-resolution
recorded by the Transition
magnetograms. Observations
Region and Coronal Explorer in the 17.1 nm passband have
shown that plages often have a reticulated appearance, referred
to as “moss.” It
is now widely accepted that AR moss
represents the downward-conductively heated, upper transition
region of the overlying hot coronal loops (Berger et al. 1999;
Fletcher & De Pontieu 1999; Martens et al. 2000; Vourlidas
et al. 2001). Rather surprisingly, however, De Pontieu et al.
(1999, 2003) found that the 17.1 nm emission is only weakly
correlated with the underlying distribution of Ca II K-line
brightness, a proxy for the photospheric ﬁeld strength (see, e.g.,
Sheeley et al. 2011; Pevtsov et al. 2016).

Recent studies have raised questions about the reliability of
present-day magnetograms and the extent to which “unipolar”
regions are actually unipolar.
In an analysis of extreme-
ultraviolet (EUV) coronal plumes employing data from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO), Wang et al. (2016) found that strong plume emission
often occurred above network concentrations where very little
minority-polarity ﬂux was visible in the HMI magnetograms.
However, simultaneous AIA images invariably showed small,
looplike structures in the cores of the plumes. In a subsequent
study focusing on unipolar plage areas, Wang (2016) found
large numbers of looplike features embedded within the plages,
with horizontal sizes of up to ∼3–5 Mm; some of the structures
had an inverted-Y topology. Partial
these
unexpected results comes from ∼0 1-resolution measurements
of an emerging AR made with the SUNRISE Imaging
(IMaX), as reported by Chitta
Magnetograph Experiment
et al. (2017). They noted that the footpoints of coronal loops
were often located near minority-polarity ﬂux that was invisible
or barely visible in the corresponding lower-resolution HMI
magnetograms (see also Chitta et al. 2018, 2019). However, the
minority-polarity elements detected using IMaX were conﬁned
to the edges of the strong plage areas, whereas the small
looplike features identiﬁed in Wang et al. (2016) and Wang
(2016) were located well inside the supposedly unipolar plages
and network concentrations, as well as at their peripheries.

The SDO study of Wang (2016) was limited to three ARs,
while the balloon-borne observations of Chitta et al. (2017)
were recorded over only 17 minutes. Because of the surprising

(0 G<Blos<100 G); dark gray (−100 G <Blos<0 G); black (Blos<−100 G). The inverted-Y structure, here seen clearly in both Fe IX (T∼0.7 MK) and
Fe XIV (T∼2.0 MK), is anchored in strong positive-polarity ﬂux. Its cusp-shaped base has a width and height on the order of 6″ (∼4 Mm). The outﬂow is ﬁrst
observed in Fe XIV before becoming visible in Fe IX, suggesting that the plasma is initially heated to high temperatures but progressively cools. The available

nature of some of these recent ﬁndings, we have searched the
AIA/HMI database for further examples of looplike ﬁne
structure inside AR plages. The ARs in our sample were
selected randomly from the period of 2013–2016, except for
the requirement
the footpoint areas should be clearly
visible in Fe IX 17.1 nm, which effectively excluded newly
emerged ARs (where the moss tends to be obscured by the
overlying bright loops) and those located very close to the
solar limb.

Plages

The AIA instrument records full-disk images in seven EUV
and three UV channels, with 0 6 pixels and 12 s cadence.
HMI provides longitudinal magnetograms with 0 5 pixels,
obtained every 45 s and having a noise level of order 10 G.
looplike ﬁne structure inside AR plages,
To search for
we employ images taken in three passbands: 17.1 nm,
dominated by Fe IX (T∼0.7–0.8 MK), 19.3 nm, dominated
by Fe XII (T∼1.5–1.6 MK), and 21.1 nm, dominated by

Fe XIV (T∼1.9–2.0 MK). The AIA and HMI images were
coaligned using the IDL procedures read_sdo and aia_prep
from the SolarSoft library.

In this section, we describe examples of transient outﬂows
from 17.1 nm moss embedded in strong unipolar ﬂux, where
the outﬂows are associated with inverted-Y structures and/or
overlie small, loop-shaped features. Such jetlike structures may
be seen in almost any AR with visible moss; we have selected
some of the clearest cases from a small, arbitrary sample
of ARs.

2.1. NOAA 11731: 2013 April 30

Figure 1 shows an example of a transient loop structure that is
rooted in unipolar AR plage and has a characteristic lifetime on
the order of an hour (see also the accompanying animation). The
sequence of Fe IX 17.1 nm (Fe XIV 21.1 nm) images in the left
(middle) column were recorded between 06:12 and 06:45 UTC
on 2013 April 30; the underlying photospheric ﬁeld is displayed
in the right column. Throughout this paper, the grayscale coding
for the HMI magnetograms is as follows: white (Blos>100 G);

Figure 2. Inverted-Y structure rooted in unipolar moss/plage inside NOAA 11734, 2013 May 4. The circled area has radius 12″ and is centered at (−215″, −206″)
(17:34 UTC). Left column: sharpened Fe IX 17.1 nm images recorded at 17:01:47, 17:16:11, 17:34:11, and 17:44:59 UTC. Middle column: corresponding images
recorded in Fe XII 19.3 nm (T∼1.6 MK) at 17:01:42, 17:16:06, 17:34:06, and 17:44:54 UTC; again, an unsharp mask has been applied. Right column: HMI
magnetograms taken at 17:02:06, 17:16:21, 17:34:21, and 17:44:51 UTC, with the grayscale saturated at±100 G as in Figure 1. The inverted-Y structure is most
clearly seen in the Fe IX images, where it appears in isolation; the Fe XII images show a collection of relatively diffuse loops with complex ﬁne structure around their
footpoints.

light gray (0 G<Blos<100 G); dark gray (−100 G <Blos<
0 G); black (Blos<−100 G).

Initially, the loop is observed as a progressively strengthen-
ing outﬂow from a brightening in the underlying moss, with the
outﬂowing material being more visible in Fe XIV than in Fe IX.
Subsequently, the 21.1 nm emission weakens relative to the
lower-temperature 17.1 nm emission and is the ﬁrst to fade.
The loop has an inverted-Y topology, with a bright, triangular
base suggestive of the “fan” or “dome” of a coronal
jet.
Located in the positive-polarity plage with ﬁeld strengths
the base has horizontal and vertical
exceeding 100 G,
dimensions of roughly 6″ (∼4 Mm), corresponding to ∼3
granular diameters. The cusp-like apex appears to rise with
time, as might be expected if reconnection or ﬂux exchange
between two loop systems is occurring at a null point.

2.2. NOAA 11734: 2013 May 4

The Fe IX 17.1 nm images in the leftmost column of Figure 2
show the evolution of another inverted-Y loop, as observed

inside NOAA 11734 on 2013 May 4; an unsharp mask has
been applied to bring out the ﬁne structure. The base is rooted
in negative unipolar plage and appears to consist of one or
more small, looplike features. Although not displayed here,
subsequent
images show the overlying stalk fading after
∼18:00 UTC, leaving a compact brightening at its footpoint.
The middle column of Figure 2 shows the evolution of the
same region as it appears in sharpened Fe XII 19.3 nm images.
The coronal loops are more diffuse and occupy a wider area of
moss in Fe XII (T∼2.0 MK) than in Fe IX (T∼0.7 MK).
looplike features and compact
small,
Again, however,
brightenings are seen at
the footpoints of the large-scale
loops. The solitary inverted-Y structure appearing in Fe IX is
no longer as distinct in Fe XII, where it is surrounded by
similar structures. As in the example of Figure 1, the outﬂow
becomes visible earlier and fades earlier
in the higher-
temperature passband. The coronal emission becomes even
more diffuse and widespread in Fe XIV 21.1 nm images (not
displayed here).

(646″, 135″) (17:14 UTC). Left column: Fe IX 17.1 nm images recorded at 16:15:35, 16:56:11, 17:04:11, and 17:14:35 UTC. Middle column: sharpened versions of
the same images. Right column: HMI longitudinal magnetograms recorded at 16:15:35, 16:56:05, 17:04:20, and 17:14:50 UTC and saturated at±100 G. In the 17:14
UTC panels, the arrow points to a clearly deﬁned loop situated next to the footpoint of the long 17.1 nm stalk. This small, bright loop has a horizontal extent of ∼4″
and is rooted in purely unipolar plage, according to the corresponding HMI magnetogram. The available animation presents time sequences, running from 16:40 to
17:29 UTC, of (left to right) the 17.1 nm images; the 17.1 nm images with contours of Blos superimposed; and the HMI magnetograms. The gray scale for the
magnetograms and the colored contour lines are as indicated in Figure 1’s caption.
(An animation of this ﬁgure is available.)

2.3. NOAA 12158: 2014 September 14

The Fe IX 17.1 nm images in the left column of Figure 3
show the formation of three stalk-like structures inside NOAA
in the middle column, an
12158 on 2014 September 14;
unsharp mask has been applied to the same sequence of
images, which were recorded between 16:15 and 17:14 UTC.
At 17:14 UTC (bottom panels), a small, bright loop is clearly
visible within the circled area just to the northeast of the image
to the base of the narrow
center. This loop,
17.1 nm stalk, has a horizontal extent of ∼4″ and is rooted
entirely within the negative-polarity plage. It is not as well
deﬁned in 19.3 or 21.1 nm images (not displayed here). A
comparison of the images taken at 17:04 and 17:14 UTC
suggests that the looplike feature was earlier attached to the
stalk but then separated from it (see also the accompanying
animation). The separation might be due to the fading of the

located next

original stalk/jet and the strengthening of the adjacent outﬂow.
We also note that reconnection between small- and large-scale
loop systems would lead to an exchange of footpoints and
changes in the intensities and orientations of the reconnecting
structures.

2.4. NOAA 12221: 2014 December 1

The 17.1 nm images in the left column of Figure 4 show a
number of inverted-Y structures inside NOAA 12221 during
2014 December 1;
the middle column displays sharpened
versions of the same images. At 01:22 UTC, in the southwest
quadrant of the circled area, a small loop of width ∼3″ may be
seen embedded in the positive-polarity plage at the base of a
narrow outﬂow stream. Another inverted-Y structure is visible
to the northeast, whose eastern leg is located above a negative-
polarity region. In the image taken at 02:14 UTC, the long,

(−323″, 70″) (02:14 UTC). Left column: Fe IX 17.1 nm images recorded at 01:22:11, 02:00:35, 02:14:59, and 02:37:11 UTC. Middle column: sharpened versions of
the same images. Right column: HMI magnetograms recorded at 01:22:10, 02:00:25, 02:14:40, and 02:37:10 UTC and saturated at±100 G. In the 17.1 nm images
taken at 01:22 UTC, the inverted-Y structure toward the eastern edge of the circled area has one leg rooted in or near an area of minority-polarity ﬂux.

newly formed stalk rooted inside the circle has a topologically
complex base that is centered above an area where the unipolar
ﬁeld is relatively weak (<100 G). At 02:37 UTC, the HMI
magnetogram shows some minority-polarity ﬂux elements
invading this weaker-ﬁeld corridor, but the shrunken base of
the narrow stalk remains embedded in positive-polarity ﬂux.

2.5. NOAA 12232: 2014 December 13–15
The (original and sharpened) Fe IX 17.1 nm images in
Figure 5, recorded at 14:06 UTC on 2014 December 13, show a
row of three inverted-Y structures inside NOAA 12232. Their
bases have horizontal dimensions of ∼3″, close to the typical
granular diameter of ∼2″. The southernmost structure overlies
an area containing minority-polarity ﬂux, but the two structures
to the north are rooted entirely inside positive-polarity plage or
strong network. The middle Fe IX structure is not visible in
Fe XII 19.3 nm (third panel). It is also noteworthy that the
bright 17.1 nm moss underlying these structures extends
southward into an area of relatively weak, mixed-polarity ﬂux;
this is consistent with the idea that the moss contains small
loops (see also Figures 8 and 11 below).

Figure 6 displays 17.1 and 19.3 nm observations of the same
AR during 10:31–11:01 UTC on December 15. Toward the top
of the circled area, the 17.1 nm image recorded at 10:31 UTC
shows a pair of closely spaced stalks with a suggestion of cusp-
these narrow
like features at

their bases. By 10:51 UTC,

inverted-Y structures have largely faded away. In the mean-
time, a brightening near the center of the circled area increases
in size and intensity and develops into a 17.1 nm stalk with a
large, bulbous base having horizontal dimensions of ∼6″ or
∼4 Mm (see the bottom left image recorded at 11:01 UTC). As
observed in the 19.3 nm passband, this structure was already
present at 10:31 UTC, but continually brightens over the next
30 minutes. The dome-shaped base (which may actually consist
of an arcade of small loops) is entirely embedded within the
positive-polarity plage. Near the bottom of the circled area, the
sharpened 19.3 nm images also show a loop-shaped feature that
appears to straddle the boundary between the positive- and
negative-polarity regions.

2.6. NOAA 12436: 2015 October 23

The sequence of Fe IX 17.1 nm images in the left column of
Figure 7 show the formation of an inverted-Y structure inside
NOAA 12436 on 2015 October 23. The dome-like base is
rooted in positive-polarity plage and has an angular size of
∼6″. Initially, at 01:10 UTC, a brightening in the underlying
moss is observed, which evolves into a small, curved feature at
01:14 UTC. The narrow stalk seen at 01:22 UTC greatly
widens by 10:27 UTC. The corresponding Fe XIV 21.1 nm
images in the middle column of Figure 7 show a broad, diffuse
outﬂow from the same area throughout this period, with the
base structure being topologically similar to that observed in

Wang, Ugarte-Urra, & Reep

during 2015 December 19. At 05:34 UTC, a compact, short-
lived brightening (arrowed) is observed above the base of the
outﬂow/jet; from the HMI magnetogram, note the presence of
small minority-polarity ﬂux elements just northward of the
base. The location of the compact brightening is roughly
coincident with that of the cusp-like feature indicated by the
arrow in the 05:36 UTC frame. At 05:45 UTC, a small, bright
loop having a width of ∼3″ is clearly visible under the 17.1 nm
jet. The accompanying animation shows weak negative-
polarity elements just southward of the base region impinging
on the positive-polarity plage and disappearing, as a result of
resolution/
either ﬂux cancellation or
instrument sensitivity. As in the example of Figure 5,
the
17.1 nm images in Figure 8 show bright moss extending even
into the regions of mixed polarity to the east and southeast of
the circled area (see also Figure 11 below).

3. Looplike Fine Structure at the Base of Bright Coronal
Loops

In the preceding section, we displayed examples of transient
outﬂows occurring above loop- or cusp-shaped features rooted
inside supposedly unipolar plage areas. This arbitrary sample
from the AIA/HMI image archive provides further support for
the assertion that AR plages contain signiﬁcant amounts of
minority-polarity ﬂux that does not appear
in the HMI
magnetograms. The following examples pertain more generally
to the relationship between the looplike ﬁne structure observed
in AR moss and the heating of the overlying large-scale loops.

3.1. NOAA 11734: 2013 May 5

The 17.1 and 19.3 nm images in Figure 9 focus on a bundle
of long coronal loops embedded in a unipolar plage area within
NOAA 11734. The observations were taken between 00:07 and
00:45 UTC on 2013 May 5. In the sharpened 17.1 nm images,
small, curved features and compact brightenings may be seen at
the footpoints of the loops. This ﬁne-scale (∼3″–4″) structure
appears to change continually over the 38 minute interval, as
does the detailed spatial and intensity distribution of the
overlying loops. The Fe XII loops shown in the third column of
Figure 9 are wider and more diffuse than their Fe IX
counterparts, but likewise exhibit time-varying, topologically
complex structure at their bases.

3.2. NOAA 12443: 2015 November 5

As another example, the left column of Figure 10 shows a
collection of Fe IX 17.1 nm loops at four different times during
late 2015 November 5;
the middle column displays the
corresponding Fe XII 19.3 nm images. The loops are located
in an area of unipolar plage within NOAA 12443. Again, a
continually evolving conﬁguration of compact brightenings
and small, looplike features, with scale sizes of ∼3″–6″, may
be seen at the footpoints of the 17.1 nm loops. These ﬁne-
structure changes are accompanied by variations in the
overlying coronal emission; for example, the arrowed footpoint
feature in the bottom left panel of Figure 10 underlies a newly
brightened 17.1 nm stalk (see the accompanying animation,
which also shows downﬂows occurring as Fe IX loops fade).
As observed at higher temperatures, the coronal emission is

show a row of three inverted-Y structures with base widths of order 3″; the
southernmost structure overlies a small pocket of minority/negative-polarity
ﬂux, but the other two structures are rooted in positive-polarity plage/network.
The 19.3 nm image does not show the middle structure, although a number of
other loops with bulbous bases are seen in and around the circled area.
Comparing the top and bottom panels, we note that the bright 17.1 nm moss
extends south- and southeastward from the center of the circled area into a
region of weak, mixed-polarity ﬂux.

01:10 UTC, a faint, narrow “jet” with a cusp-shaped base is
visible just to the west of the moss brightening.)

the top of the circled area, the 17.1 nm images show a pair of narrow stalks (also visible in the 19.3 nm passband) with cusp-like bases, which fade between 10:31 and
11:01 UTC. Meanwhile, near the center of the circled area, another jetlike structure forms, whose bright, dome-shaped base has a width of ∼6″ (∼4 Mm). This structure
(which may contain separate components that merge in the line of sight) is also prominent in the 19.3 nm images, where it is already visible at 10:31 UTC. A variety of
small, looplike features may be seen within the 19.3 nm moss, some of which appear to have one leg rooted in the negative-polarity ﬂux at the edge of the positive-
polarity plage (see, e.g., the arrowed feature at 10:51 UTC).

more diffuse and ubiquitous, but complexly structured bright-
enings may still be seen at the footpoints of the Fe XII loops.

4. Relationship Between Moss and the Photospheric Field
Strength
An inspection of the previous ﬁgures suggests that, while
areas of bright 17.1 and 19.3 nm moss frequently overlie a
strong (>100 G) photospheric ﬁeld, they may also occur where
the underlying ﬁeld is relatively weak. Conversely, areas of
strong unipolar ﬂux sometimes appear dark in the 17.1 nm
bandpass; this is usually due to the presence of horizontal ﬁbril
structure in the vicinity of polarity inversions.

Figure 11 focuses on an area of moss observed inside NOAA
12232 on 2015 December 15 (this region is located near the top
left corner of the images in Figure 6). The bright 17.1 nm
moss within the circle is seen to overlie a patch of weak,

mixed-polarity ﬁeld. Morphologically, it is virtually indistin-
guishable from the adjoining moss that extends over the
positive-polarity plage to the southwest, where the ﬁeld
strengths are in excess of 100 G. This similarity in appearance
suggests that moss is not simply a tracer of the footpoints of hot
coronal loops embedded in strong unipolar ﬂux. (Figures 5 and
8 provide further examples of bright moss that extends into
areas of mixed polarity.)

As remarked in Wang (2016), moss-like regions are also
found outside ARs. Figure 12 shows the 17.1, 19.3, and
21.1 nm emission associated with a chain of negative-polarity
network elements located just to the north of NOAA 12321, as
observed at 14:29 UTC on 2015 April 18. In the sharpened
looplike
17.1 nm image,
features may be seen within a “mossy” region that is oriented
roughly along the axis of the supergranular network elements.

whose looplike nature is also suggested by the 17.1 and 21.1 nm images recorded at 01:14 UTC. The base has an angular size of ∼6″ and is embedded in positive-
polarity plage. The outﬂow observed in the 17.1 nm passband widens considerably between 01:22 and 01:37 UTC. The 19.3 nm images show diffuse emission over

Finally, Figure 13 shows an inverted-Y structure embedded in
an area of moss inside NOAA 12335, as observed at 06:14 UTC
on 2015 May 5. The base of the structure is rooted in strong
negative-polarity plage, but the bright moss occupies a much
wider area, extending through the weaker-ﬁeld region to the
south. The dark areas in the 17.1 nm image in the top panel
represent ﬁbrilar and ﬁlament material located near large- and
small-scale polarity inversion lines.

These examples suggest

that a strong underlying photo-
spheric ﬁeld is neither a necessary nor a sufﬁcient condition for
the presence of bright moss.

5. Summary and Discussion

We have presented illustrative examples of

inverted-Y
structures embedded inside Fe IX 17.1 nm moss, where the
underlying photospheric ﬁeld was purely unipolar according to
simultaneous HMI magnetograms. (Additional examples may
be seen in Figures 2, 4, and 5 of Wang 2016.) The triangular or
dome-shaped bases of these structures had horizontal dimen-
sions of ∼3″–6″ or ∼2–4 Mm. In the standard topological
interpretation, the base contains minority-polarity ﬂux, with a
null point located at its apex. The lifetimes of the looplike

footpoint features ranged from less than a minute to the order of
an hour, with the smaller features generally being shorter-lived
than the larger ones.

As an alternative possibility that does not require the
presence of minority-polarity ﬂux, the triangular structures
might represent canopies overlying individual granular cells,
with thermal pressure dominating above the cell centers and
excluding the unipolar ﬂux fanning out from the granular
lanes. However, the base widths of some of our inverted-Y
structures are well in excess of a granular diameter (∼2″).
Moreover, the observed cusps are generally located at heights
above ∼2 Mm, where the plasma β falls well below unity and
thermal pressure becomes negligible (see, e.g., Figure 3 in
Gary 2001). In addition, in cases such as that displayed in the
bottom panels of Figure 3, small
loops are sometimes
unmistakably present.

We are thus led to conclude that AR plages may contain
minority-polarity ﬂux that does not appear in HMI long-
itudinal magnetograms. That the footpoints of the looplike
features are often separated by as many as ∼5–10 pixels
suggests that the failure to detect the minority polarity is not
simply a matter of spatial resolution, but may also be related
to instrument sensitivity. We conjecture that pixels containing
strong ﬂux of the dominant polarity sometimes “bleed” into

lived brightening occurs near the location of the cusp-like feature indicated by the arrow in the 05:36 UTC frame. At 05:45 UTC, a small, bright loop is clearly visible
under the 17.1 nm jet, with minority-polarity ﬂux elements present just southward of it. Throughout this period, both the 17.1 and the 19.3 nm images show looplike
features pervading the moss, which extends even into the regions of mixed polarity to the east and southeast of the circled area. The available animation presents time
sequences, running from 05:19 to 05:59 UTC, of (left to right): the 17.1 nm images, the 17.1 nm images with contours of Blos superimposed, and the HMI

of-sight magnetogram is constructed from 72 individual
ﬁltergrams taken over a 270 s period; the procedure involves
correcting for differential rotation and interpolating in both

Although the looplike features described here have hor-
izontal extents 3″, some of the 17.1 nm images in this paper
and in Wang (2016) suggest the presence of loops even closer
to the ∼1″ resolution limit. From their analyses of 19.3 nm
images recorded with ∼0 3–0 4 resolution by the rocket-
borne High-resolution Coronal Imager, Peter et al. (2013) and
Barczynski et al. (2017) have found evidence for granular-size
coronal loops with footpoint separations of only ∼1 Mm. On
this spatial scale, it is hardly surprising that the corresponding

HMI magnetograms showed the same polarity at both loop
footpoints.

Section 3 focused on collections of large-scale loops that
were rooted in unipolar ﬂux and that underwent brightness
changes on timescales of minutes to an hour. These intensity
variations were accompanied by changes in the ﬁne-scale
structure of the loop footpoints, where compact brightenings
and small looplike features were observed. We attribute this
continually evolving footpoint
topology to the effect of
reconnection with minority-polarity ﬂux that does not appear
in the HMI magnetograms. An alternative interpretation might
be that
the loop legs are being directly deformed by the
underlying granular convection itself, rather than by recon-
nection processes driven by this convection or by small-scale
ﬂux emergence. However, deformations due to granular
jostling would be propagated away by magnetohydrodynamic
waves and could not account for the compact brightenings
and cusp-shaped features that extend to heights 2 Mm,
where β=1.

Figure 9. Time-varying footpoint structure below a bundle of coronal loops inside NOAA 11734, 2013 May 5. The circled area has a radius of 15″ and is centered at
(−176″, −208″) (00:22 UTC). Leftmost column: Fe IX 17.1 nm images taken at 00:07:23, 00:15:11, 00:22:23, and 00:45:11 UTC. Second column: sharpened
versions of the same images. Third column: sharpened Fe XII 19.3 nm images taken at 00:07:18, 00:15:06, 00:22:18, and 00:45:06 UTC. Rightmost column: HMI
magnetograms recorded at 00:07:21, 00:14:51, 00:22:21, and 00:44:51 UTC and saturated at±100 G. The curved features and compact brightenings underlying the
long 17.1 nm loops have horizontal dimensions typically on the order of 3″–4″. As observed in Fe XII, the bundle of coronal loops is broader and more diffuse than in
Fe IX, but the footpoint region continues to exhibit a complex topology.

As mentioned in the Introduction, De Pontieu et al.
(1999, 2003) found that AR moss emission is poorly correlated
with Ca II K-line brightness, a proxy for
the unsigned
photospheric ﬂux. We have shown examples of bright moss
overlying relatively weak ﬁeld, including even areas of mixed
polarity (see Figures 5, 8, and 11). Such observations provide
support for the hypothesis that the moss emission depends not
just on the strength of the photospheric ﬁeld, but also on the
presence of minority-polarity ﬂux, which in turn gives rise to
the looplike ﬁne structure seen in mossy regions both inside
and outside ARs.

In the transient outﬂow events described in Section 2, we
found a general tendency for the outﬂows to appear in the
higher-temperature passbands (21.1 and 19.3 nm) well before
becoming visible at 17.1 nm. This behavior may be understood
if the evaporating chromospheric material is initially heated to
high temperatures, but subsequently cools (see, e.g., Ugarte-
Urra et al. 2006; Aschwanden et al. 2007). The sporadic and
isolated nature of some of our events suggests that they may
have been triggered by underlying ﬂux emergence. It is also

well known that
lower-temperature loops tend to be more
dynamic, with faster cooling rates and shorter lifetimes, than
high-temperature loops (see Ugarte-Urra & Warren 2012, and
references therein).

We have focused on relatively cool (T2 MK) coronal
loops because they are more easily identiﬁed and tracked than
the diffuse, high-temperature loops that occupy most of the
moss (Berger et al. 1999; Fletcher & De Pontieu 1999). As
suggested by the 17.1 nm images in Figure 1, many areas of
brightened moss do not show overlying loops in the lower-
temperature passbands. Based on our examples involving
“activated” 17.1, 19.3, and 21.1 nm loops, we infer that the
moss emission is enhanced where minority-polarity ﬂux
undergoes reconnection with the dominant-polarity ﬁeld. If
these footpoint reconnection events heat the overlying loops to
in excess of ∼2 MK,
lower-temperature
temperatures well
loops will be observed only if the hot loops have sufﬁcient time
to cool before the next reconnection event (see Ugarte-Urra
et al. 2009).

The brightness and spatial distribution of the 17.1 nm loops vary continually over the 5 hr period, as does the underlying ﬁne structure, which consists of looplike
features and compact brightenings. Arrows in the 17.1 nm image recorded at 22:51 UTC point to a bright outﬂow stream with a compact brightening at its base.
Animations suggest that the fading of the Fe IX loops is often accompanied by downﬂows. At progressively higher temperatures, the coronal emission becomes
increasingly diffuse and widespread; however, the Fe XII loops continue to exhibit complexly structured brightenings at their bases. Most of the footpoint structures
are rooted in unipolar plage. The available animation presents time sequences, running from 20:59 to 22:58 UTC, of (left to right): the 17.1 nm images, the 17.1 nm
images with contours of Blos superimposed, and the HMI magnetograms. The gray scale for the magnetograms and the colored contour lines are as indicated in
Figure 1’s caption.
(An animation of this ﬁgure is available.)

Additional heating mechanisms, such as current sheet
formation (ﬁeld-line braiding) due to footpoint shufﬂing, may
well be operating in coronal
loops. However, because the
coronal ﬁeld tends to weaken and become more uniform with
increasing height, reconnection near the loop footpoints, where
the ﬁeld is both strong and topologically complex, is likely to
play a major role provided that sufﬁcient minority-polarity ﬂux
is present. This paper has presented further evidence that the
amount of minority-polarity ﬂux inside AR plages has been
underestimated.

To investigate further the reasons for the discrepancies
between the EUV and magnetic data, it would be worthwhile to
compare SDO images of plages and network concentrations

with Hinode magnetograms, which have a spatial resolution of
∼0 3 and a noise level of order 5 G. Comparisons should
also be made with Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
observations of the underlying chromospheric ﬁne structure. In
the near future, we anticipate that the Daniel K. Inouye Solar
Telescopeʼs visible and near-infrared spectropolarimeters will
be able to measure plage magnetic ﬁelds with unprecedented
sensitivity and with spatial resolution down to 0 1.
