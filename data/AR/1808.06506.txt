1 Introduction

We study a matrix diﬀerential equation ˙x = ABx, whose matrix
is a product of an m×n complex matrix A and an n×m complex
matrix B. It is equivalent to ˙y = S−1ARR−1BSy, in which S and
R are nonsingular matrices and x = Sy. Thus, we can reduce
(A, B) by transformations of contragredient equivalence

(A, B) 7→ (S−1AR, R−1BS),

S and R are nonsingular. (1)

The canonical form of (A, B) with respect to these transforma-
tions was obtained by Dobrovol′skaya and Ponomarev [3] and,
independently, by Horn and Merino[5]:

each pair (A, B) is contragrediently equivalent to a direct sum,
uniquely determined up to permutation of summands, of pairs
of the types (Ir, Jr(λ)), (Jr(0), Ir), (Fr, Gr), (Gr, Fr),

(A1, B1) ⊕ (A2, B2) := (A1 ⊕ A2, B1 ⊕ B2).

Note that (F1, G1) = (010, 010); we denote by 0mn the zero matrix
of size m × n, where m, n ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . }. All matrices that we
consider are complex matrices. All matrix pairs that we consider
are counter pairs: a matrix pair (A, B) is a counter pair if A and
BT have the same size.

A notion of miniversal deformation was introduced by Arnold
[1, 2]. He constructed a miniversal deformation of a Jordan ma-
trix J; i.e., a simple normal form to which all matrices J +E close

2

to J can be reduced by similarity transformations that smoothly
depend on the entries of E. García-Planas and Sergeichuk [4]
constructed a miniversal deformation of a canonical pair (2) for
contragredient equivalence (1).

(A+
is called a perturbation of (A, B). Each perturbation (
(A, B) deﬁnes the induced perturbation A

matrix AB that is obtained as follows:
