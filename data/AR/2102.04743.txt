ABSTRACT
We have used very high-cadence (sub-minute) observations of the solar mean magnetic ﬁeld
(SMMF) from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) to investigate the mor-
phology of the SMMF. The observations span a period from 1992–2012, and the high-cadence
observations allowed the exploration of the power spectrum up to frequencies in the mHz
range. The power spectrum contains several broad peaks from a rotationally-modulated (RM)
component, whose linewidths allowed us to measure, for the ﬁrst time, the lifetime of the RM
source. There is an additional broadband, background component in the power spectrum which
we have shown is an artefact of power aliasing due to the low ﬁll of the data. The sidereal
rotation period of the RM component was measured as 25.23 ± 0.11 days and suggests that the
signal is sensitive to a time-averaged latitude of ∼ 12◦. We have also shown the RM lifetime
to be 139.6 ± 18.5 days. This provides evidence to suggest the RM component of the SMMF
is connected to magnetic ﬂux concentrations (MFCs) and active regions (ARs) of magnetic
ﬂux, based both on its lifetime and location on the solar disc.

INTRODUCTION

The Sun has a complicated magnetic ﬁeld structure; many features of
the Sun and proxies for the solar activity are related to the evolution
of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld.

The solar mean magnetic ﬁeld (SMMF) is a surprising, non-
zero measurement of the imbalance of opposite polarities of mag-
netic ﬂux observed on the full visible disc of the Sun (Svalgaard et al.
1975), and is deﬁned as the mean line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld
when observing the Sun-as-a-star (Scherrer et al. 1977a,b; García
et al. 1999). In the literature the SMMF is also sometimes referred
to as the general magnetic ﬁeld (GMF) (Severny 1971) or the mean
magnetic ﬁeld (MMF) (Kotov 2008) of the Sun.

Observations of the SMMF have typically been made by
measuring the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines using a ground-
based Babcock-type magnetograph (Scherrer et al. 1977a), al-
though more recently the SMMF has been calculated from full-disc
LOS magnetograms taken from space-borne telescopes such as the
Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(SDO/HMI) (Kutsenko et al. 2017; Bose & Nagaraju 2018). It is
understood that the strength of the SMMF may vary depending on
the spectral line used to measure it (Kotov 2008, 2012); however,

the SMMF varies slowly with the solar activity cycle, with an am-
plitude on the order of a Gauss during solar maximum and a tenth of
a Gauss during solar minimum (Plachinda et al. 2011). In addition,
the SMMF displays a strong, quasi-coherent rotational signal which
must arise from inhomogeneities on the solar disc with lifetimes of
several rotations (Chaplin et al. 2003; Xie et al. 2017).

Despite existing literature on SMMF observations spanning
several decades, the SMMF origin remains an open debate in so-
lar physics. The principal component of the SMMF is commonly
assumed to be weak, large-scale magnetic ﬂux, distributed over
the entire solar disc, rather than from magnetic ﬂux concentrations
(MFCs), active regions (ARs), or sunspots (Severny 1971; Scherrer
et al. 1977a; Xiang & Qu 2016). However, conversely, Scherrer et al.
(1972) found that the SMMF was most highly correlated with only
the inner-most one quarter, by area, of the solar disc, which is more
sensitive to active latitudes.

In recent literature, Bose & Nagaraju (2018) provided a novel
approach to understanding the SMMF whereby they decomposed
the SMMF through feature identiﬁcation and pixel-by-pixel analysis
of full-disc magnetograms. They concluded that: (i) the observed
variability in the SMMF lies in the polarity imbalance of large-scale
magnetic ﬁeld structures on the visible surface of the Sun; (ii) the
correlation between the ﬂux from sunspots and the SMMF is sta-
tistically insigniﬁcant; and (iii) more critically that the background

ﬂux dominates the SMMF, accounting for around 89 per cent of
the variation in the SMMF. However, there still remained a strong
manifestation of the rotation signal in the background component
presented by Bose & Nagaraju (2018). This signal is indicative
of inhomogeneous magnetic features with lifetimes on the order of
several solar rotations, rather than the short-lived, weaker ﬁelds usu-
ally associated with the large-scale background. It therefore raises
the question of whether their technique assigned ﬂux from MFCs
or ARs to the background. It is possible that some of the strong
ﬂux may have been assigned to the background signal, which then
contributed to this rotation signal.

Despite these ﬁndings, it is known that the strength of the
SMMF is weaker during solar minimum, when there are fewer
ARs, and stronger during solar maximum, when there are more
ARs (Plachinda et al. 2011). This is suggestive that the evolution of
ARs has relevance for the evolution of the SMMF.

There is a contrasting view in the literature which claims AR
ﬂux dominates the SMMF. Kutsenko et al. (2017) state that a large
component of the SMMF may be explained by strong and intermedi-
ate ﬂux regions. These regions are associated with ARs, suggesting
between 65 to 95 per cent of the SMMF could be attributed to strong
and intermediate ﬂux from ARs, and the fraction of the occupied
area varied between 2 to 6 per cent of the solar disc, depending
on the chosen threshold for separating weak and strong ﬂux. This
ﬁnding suggests that strong, long-lived, inhomogeneous MFCs pro-
duce the strong rotation signal in the SMMF; however, Kutsenko
et al. (2017) also discuss that there is an entanglement of strong
ﬂux (typically associated with ARs) and intermediate ﬂux (typi-
cally associated with network ﬁelds and remains of decayed ARs).
This means it is diﬃcult to determine whether strong ARs or their
remnants contribute to the SMMF.

The Sun’s dynamo and hence magnetic ﬁeld is directly coupled
to the solar rotation. The Sun exhibits latitude-dependent and depth-
dependent diﬀerential rotation with a sidereal, equatorial period of
around 25 days (Howe 2009). To Earth-based observers, the synodic
rotation of the Sun is observed at around 27 days, and the SMMF
displays a dominant signal at this period, and its harmonics (Chaplin
et al. 2003; Xie et al. 2017; Bose & Nagaraju 2018). It was also
reported by Xie et al. (2017) that the diﬀerential solar rotation was
observed in the SMMF with measured synodic rotational periods
of 28.28 ± 0.67 days and 27.32 ± 0.64 days for the rising and
declining phases, respectively, of all of the solar cycles in their
considered time-frame.

On the other hand, Xiang & Qu (2016) utilised ensemble em-
pirical mode decomposition (EEMD) analysis to extract modes of
the SMMF and found two rotation periods which are derived from
diﬀerent strengths of magnetic ﬂux elements. They found that a
rotation period of 26.6 days was related to weaker magnetic ﬂux
elements within the SMMF, while the measured period was slightly
longer, at 28.5 days, for stronger magnetic ﬂux elements.

In this work, we use high-cadence (sub-minute) observations
of the SMMF, made by the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network
(BiSON) (Chaplin et al. 1996, 2005; Hale et al. 2016), to investigate
its morphology. This work provides a frequency domain analysis of
the SMMF, and a rotationally-modulated (RM) component with a
period of around 27 days is clearly observed as several peaks in the
power spectrum. The breakdown of the paper is as follows.

In Section 2, we provide an overview of the BiSON data used
in this work; how the observations are made and the SMMF data
are acquired. As this work provides an investigation of the SMMF
in the frequency domain, in Section 3 we discuss in detail how the
power spectrum was modelled.

In Section 4 the results from modelling the power spectrum are
presented. We outline the key ﬁndings and draw similarities between
the properties of the RM component and ARs, suggesting that ARs
may provide a strong contribution to the SMMF. Conclusions and
discussions are presented in Section 5.

2 DATA

2.1 Summary of the Data Set

Chaplin et al. (2003) provided the ﬁrst examination of the SMMF
using data from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (Bi-
SON), and the work presented in this paper is a continuation of that
study.

BiSON is a six-station, ground-based, global network of tele-
scopes continuously monitoring the Sun, which principally makes
precise measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the
photosphere due to solar 𝑝 mode oscillations (Hale et al. 2016).
Through the use of polarizing optics and additional electronics, the
BiSON spectrometers can measure both the disc-averaged LOS ve-
locity and magnetic ﬁeld in the photosphere (Chaplin et al. 2003);
however, not all BiSON sites measure the SMMF.

In this study we focus on the data collected by the Suther-
land node in South Africa, which was also used by Chaplin et al.
(2003). This is the only station that has had the capability to mea-
sure and collect data on the SMMF long-term. Data are sampled on
a 40-second cadence, and the SMMF data collected by the Suther-
land station span the epoch from 01/1992 – 12/2012 (i.e. covering
7643 days). Over this period, the average duty cycle of the 40-
second data is ∼ 15.6 per cent. If instead we take a daily average of
the BiSON SMMF, the average duty cycle is ∼ 55.2 per cent. This
gives a higher duty cycle but a lower Nyquist frequency. Because
of the much lower Nyquist frequency, modelling the background
power spectral density is more challenging; therefore we use the
40-second cadence data in this work. However, both data sets return
similar results; we discuss later in Section 3.2 how we handled the
impact of the low duty cycle of the 40-second data. A comparison
of the daily-averaged SMMF observations made by BiSON to those
made by the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) is given in Chaplin
et al. (2003).

2.2 Obtaining the SMMF from BiSON

To acquire the SMMF from BiSON data, the method described by
Chaplin et al. (2003) was adopted; here we discuss the key aspects.
Each BiSON site employs a resonant scattering spectrometer
(RSS) to measure the Doppler shift of the Zeeman 2S1/2 → 2P1/2
line of potassium, at 769.9 nm (Brookes et al. 1978). A potassium
vapour cell placed within a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld Zeeman
splits the laboratory line into the two allowed D1 transitions (Lund
et al. 2017). The intensity of the longer wavelength (red; 𝐼𝑅) and
shorter wavelength (blue; 𝐼𝐵) components of the line may be mea-
sured by the RSS almost simultaneously, by using polarizing optics
to switch between the red and blue wings of the line, to form the ratio
given by equation (1) which is used as a proxy for the Doppler shift
from the LOS velocity of the photosphere (see Brookes et al. (1976,
1978); Elsworth et al. (1995a); Chaplin et al. (2003); Broomhall
et al. (2009); Davies et al. (2014b); Lund et al. (2017)):

positive is for a ﬁeld pointing outwards from the Sun. (b) Power spectrum

Nyquist frequency is 12500 𝜇Hz.

Furthermore, conversion from ratio residuals into velocity

residuals uses the calibration given by equation (7):

Figure 1. An example of the BiSON ratio data over a 30-minute period. The
separation between the 2 ratios is due to the solar mean magnetic ﬁeld and
oscillations are due to the 5-minute 𝑝 mode signal.

Photospheric magnetic ﬁelds Zeeman split the Fraunhofer line
and the Zeeman-split components have opposite senses of circular
polarization (Chaplin et al. 2003). Additional polarizing optics are
used in the RSS to manipulate the sense of circular polarization
(either + or -) that is passed through the instrument. The ratio R+
or R− is formed, and the ratios R± would be equal if there was no
magnetic ﬁeld present.

The observed ratio (R±) may be decomposed as:

(2)

R± = Rorb + Rspin + Rgrs + 𝛿𝑟osc (𝑡) ± 𝛿𝑟B (𝑡) ,
where Rorb is due to the radial component of the Earth’s orbital
velocity around the Sun, Rspin is due to the component towards the
Sun of the Earth’s diurnal rotation about its spin axis as a function
of latitude and time, Rgrs is from the gravitational red-shift of the
solar line (Elsworth et al. 1995b; Dumbill 1999), 𝛿𝑟osc (𝑡) is due to
the LOS velocity due to 𝑝 mode oscillations, and 𝛿𝑟𝐵 (𝑡) is due to
the magnetic ﬁeld (± denotes the polarity of the Zeeman-split line
that is being observed) (Dumbill 1999). The eﬀect of the magnetic
ﬁeld on the ratio is shown in Fig. 1, and from equation (3), the
diﬀerence between the opposite magnetic ﬁeld ratios is twice the
magnetic ratio residual, i.e.:

R+ − R− = 2 𝛿𝑟B (𝑡) .

(3)

𝛿𝑣(𝑡) =

(cid:18) 𝑑R𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑐
𝑑𝑉

𝛿𝑟 (𝑡) .

(7)

The BiSON RSS is measuring the velocity variation on the
solar disc, and therefore a calibration from the ratio to a velocity
is necessary. One method of calibration is achieved by ﬁrst ﬁtting
a 2nd- or 3rd-order polynomial as a function of velocity to the
observed ratio averaged over both magnetic polarities, as discussed
by Elsworth et al. (1995b). Here we chose to ﬁt the ratio in terms of
velocity, Rcalc (𝑢), i.e.,

Rcalc (𝑢) =

∑︁

R𝑛𝑢𝑛 ,

𝑛

where:

(4)

𝑢 = 𝑣orb + 𝑣spin ,
and 𝑣orb is the velocity component related to the ratio, Rorb; 𝑣spin
is related to the ratio, Rspin; 𝑛 is the polynomial order.

(5)

It is possible to see that through the removal of Rcalc (𝑢) (which
we set up to also account for Rgrs) from the observed ratios, one
is left with the ratio residuals of the 𝑝 mode oscillations and the
magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.,

R± − Rcalc (𝑢) = 𝛿𝑟osc (𝑡) ± 𝛿𝑟B (𝑡) .

(6)

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2020)

In order to ﬁnally obtain the SMMF in units of magnetic ﬁeld,
one must combine equation (3) and equation (7) with the conversion
factor in equation (9) (Dumbill 1999), and the entire procedure can
be simpliﬁed into:

and 𝜇𝐵 is the Bohr magneton, ℎ is Planck’s constant, 𝑐 is the speed

Through the application of this methodology, one acquires the
SMMF as shown in Fig. (2a). The power spectrum of the full, 7643-
day Sutherland data set is shown in Fig. (2b), and it shows a strong
rotational signal at a period of ∼ 27 days. The power spectrum of the
SMMF is shown again in Fig. 3 on a logarithmic scale covering the
entire frequency range, which highlights the broadband background
component of the power spectrum.

3 METHODOLOGY

3.1 Parametrization of the SMMF Power Spectrum

As we have 40-second cadence observations of the SMMF, we were
able to investigate the power spectrum up to a Nyquist frequency of
12500 𝜇Hz. There are a number of features within the full SMMF
power spectrum, shown in Fig. 3.

The peaks between 0.2 – 2.0 𝜇Hz in Fig. 2b are a manifestation
of rotation in the SMMF. The distinct set of peaks indicates the exis-
tence of a long-lived, inhomogeneous, rotationally-modulated (RM)
source. Due to the quasi-coherent nature of the SMMF, and based
on the comparatively short timescales for the emergence of mag-
netic features compared to their slow decay (Zwaan 1981; Harvey &
Zwaan 1993; Hathaway & Choudhary 2008), we assume the evolu-
tion of individual features that contribute to the RM component may
be modelled by a sudden appearance and a long, exponential decay.
In the frequency-domain, each of the RM peaks may therefore be
described by a Lorentzian distribution:

𝐿𝑛 (𝜈; Γ, 𝐴𝑛, 𝜈𝑛) =

(cid:32)

2

2𝐴𝑛
𝜋Γ

1 +

(cid:18) (𝜈 − 𝜈𝑛)
Γ/2

(cid:19)2(cid:33)−1

,

(10)

where 𝜈 is frequency, 𝐴𝑛 is the root-mean-square amplitude of the
peak, Γ is the linewidth of the peak, 𝜈𝑛 is the frequency of the peak,
and 𝑛 simply ﬂags each peak. The mean-squared power in the time
domain from the RM component of the SMMF is given by the sum
of the 𝐴𝑛

2 of the individual harmonics in the power spectrum.
Through this formulation we can measure the 𝑒-folding time
(𝑇𝑒) of the amplitude of the RM component, as it is related to the
linewidth of the peak by:
Γ = (𝜋 𝑇𝑒)−1 .

(11)

The low-frequency power due to instrumental drifts, solar ac-
tivity, and the window function can be incorporated into the model
via the inclusion of a zero-frequency centred Lorentzian (Basu &
Chaplin 2017), given by:

𝐻 (𝜈; 𝜎, 𝜏) =

4𝜎2𝜏
1 + (2𝜋𝜈𝜏)2

,

(12)

where 𝜎 is the characteristic amplitude of the low frequency signal,

Figure 4. Locations of aliased power in sideband peaks. The orange dotted-
lines show the locations of frequencies at multiples of 1/day. The green
dashed-lines show the location of the sideband peaks – harmonic frequencies
reﬂected around multiples of 1/day. The inset shows a zoom of one set of
sideband peaks around 1/day.

and 𝜏 describes the characteristic timescale of the excursions around
zero in the time-domain.

Finally, the high frequency power is accounted for by the in-
clusion of a constant oﬀset due to shot-noise, 𝑐 (Basu & Chaplin
2017).

In the absence of any gaps in the data, the model function used

to describe the power spectrum is given by:

𝑃(𝜈, a) =

𝑁
∑︁

𝑛=1

𝐿𝑛 (𝜈; Γ, 𝐴𝑛, 𝜈𝑛) + 𝐻 (𝜈; 𝜎, 𝜏) + 𝑐 ;

(13)

the subscript, 𝑛, describes a single peak in the power spectrum. In
implementing the model we constrain the mode frequencies such
that they must be integer values of 𝜈0: 𝜈𝑛 = 𝑛𝜈0. This means that
we deﬁne a single rotation frequency only, 𝜈0, and subsequent peaks
are the harmonic frequencies. It is worth noting explicitly that this
function assumes the line width of each Lorentzian peak is the same,
only the amplitudes and central frequencies diﬀer.

The duty cycle of the Sutherland SMMF observations is very
low, ∼ 15 per cent, therefore it was important to take into consid-
eration the eﬀect that gaps in the data have on the power spectrum.
Gaps in the data cause an aliasing of power from the signal fre-
quencies to other frequencies in the spectrum, and the nature of the
aliasing depends on the properties of the window function of the
observations.

Periodic gaps in the data give rise to sidebands in the power
spectrum and random gaps cause a more broadband shifting of
power, meaning that some power from the low-frequency RM com-
ponent is aliased to higher frequencies. The daily, periodic gaps in
the BiSON data, due to single-site observations, produce sidebands
around a frequency of 1/day, i.e. ∼ 11.57 𝜇Hz, and its harmonics.
The aliased power is therefore located at frequencies:

𝜈𝑛,𝑖 = 𝑖 (

1
day

± 𝜈𝑛) ,

(14)

where 𝑖 denotes the sideband number and 𝑛 denotes the harmonic of
the mode. The sideband structure implied by equation (14) is shown
clearly in Fig. 4.

The tails of the aliased peaks are long, therefore aliased power
was re-distributed across the entire frequency range which produced
a red-noise-like background component. To understand the broad-
band eﬀects of the window function we generated an artiﬁcial time
series from a single Lorentzian (representing the fundamental RM

of the window function of the observations (|F [𝑔(𝑡)]|2), i.e.,

orem was obeyed, that no power was lost or gained from the convo-

3.2 Modelling the SMMF Power Spectrum

Parameter estimation using the model deﬁned in the previous sec-
tion, including all parameters, a, was performed in a Bayesian man-
ner using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ﬁtting routine.

Following from Bayes’ theorem we can state that the posterior
probability distribution, 𝑝(a|𝐷, 𝐼), is proportional to the likelihood
function, 𝐿 (𝐷|a, 𝐼), multiplied by a prior probability distribution,
𝑝(a|𝐼):

𝑝(a|𝐷, 𝐼) ∝ 𝐿 (𝐷 |a, 𝐼) 𝑝(a|𝐼) ,

(19)

where 𝐷 are the data, and 𝐼 is any prior information.

To perform the MCMC integration over the parameter space
we must deﬁne a likelihood function; however, in practice, it is
more convenient to work with logarithmic probabilities. The noise
in the power spectrum is distributed as 𝜒2 2 degrees-of-freedom
(Anderson et al. 1990; Handberg & Campante 2011; Davies et al.
2014a), therefore the log likelihood function is:

ln (𝐿) = −

(cid:26)

∑︁

𝑖

ln (𝑀𝑖 (a)) +

(cid:27)

,

𝑂𝑖
𝑀𝑖 (a)

(20)

for a model, 𝑀𝑖, with parameters, a, and observed power, 𝑂𝑖, where
𝑖 describes the frequency bin. This likelihood function assumes that
all the frequency bins are statistically independent but the eﬀect of
the window function means that they are not. We handled this issue
in the manner described below, which used simulations based on
the artiﬁcial data discussed in Section 3.1.

The prior information on each of the parameters used dur-
ing the MCMC sampling were uniform distributions (denoted by
U (𝑙, 𝑢) with 𝑙 and 𝑢 representing the lower and upper limits of the
distribution, respectively):

𝜈0 ∼ U (0.38, 0.50) 𝜇Hz
Γ ∼ U (0.00, 0.11) 𝜇Hz
𝐴1 ∼ U (100, 350) mG
𝐴2 ∼ U (50, 200) mG
𝐴3 ∼ U (20, 150) mG
𝐴4 ∼ U (10, 100) mG
𝜎 ∼ U (0.01, 500) mG
𝜏 ∼ U (0.10, 200) 106 s
𝑐 ∼ U (10−3, 102) G2 Hz−1 .

by using a fake data set and this is compared to the BiSON power spectrum.

the artiﬁcial data without and with gaps, respectively; amber line: the input

component). The artiﬁcial data were generated by calculating the
inverse Fourier transform of the power spectrum which had the same
Nyquist frequency and frequency resolution of the SMMF power
spectrum. We then injected the gaps from the BiSON observations
into this artiﬁcial time series, to ensure the window function was
the same as the BiSON SMMF, and ﬁnally investigated the resultant
power spectrum both without and without the window function.

Fig. 5 shows the eﬀect of the window function on the resul-
tant power spectrum. The power spectrum generated from the time
series without gaps produces a single Lorentzian peak (amber and
green lines). The injection of gaps into the time series (orange line)
produces both the red-noise-like background component, as well
as the sidebands, which bears a striking resemblance to the power
spectrum of the BiSON SMMF observations (black line) and also
the power spectrum of the window function (blue line).

This shows that the BiSON SMMF spectrum has a red-noise-
like background component that is not due to any ephemeral signal,
but due to the re-distribution of power by the window function of
the BiSON observations.

In the time domain, the observed data, 𝑦(𝑡), includes the win-
dow function which, analytically, we can express as a multiplication

The limits on the priors were set to cover a sensible range in
parameter space, whilst limiting non-physical results or frequency
aliasing.

The power spectrum of the 40-second cadence SMMF was
modelled using equation (17) (with 𝑁 = 4 Lorentzian peaks
in 𝑃(𝜈, a)) using the aﬃne-invariant MCMC sampler emcee
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to explore the posterior parameter
space.

The chains are not independent when using emcee, therefore
convergence was interrogated using the integrated autocorrelation
time. We computed the autocorrelation time using emcee and found
𝜏 ∼ 120 steps. Foreman-Mackey et al. (2013) suggests that chains of
length ≥ 50𝜏 are often suﬃcient. After a burn in of 6000 steps, we
used 7000 iterations on 50 chains to explore the posterior parameter
space, which was suﬃcient to ensure we had convergence on the
posterior probability distribution.

As a result of the convolution in the model the widths of the
posterior distributions for the model parameters were systematically
underestimated. This eﬀect arises because we do not account ex-
plicitly for the impact of the window function convolution on the
covariance of the data; it is diﬃcult to overcome computationally,
especially with such a large data set (∼ 107 data points). To over-
come this issue we performed the simulations using artiﬁcial data,
described above, both with and without the eﬀects of the window
function and the use of the convolution in the model. This helped us
to understand how the convolution aﬀected our ability to measure
the true posterior widths, which allowed us to account for the sys-
tematic underestimate of the credible regions of the posterior when
modelling the power spectrum of the observed BiSON SMMF.

We also analysed the data as daily, one-day-cadence averages;
this gave a higher ﬁll (∼ 55 per cent) but a lower Nyquist frequency
(∼ 5.787 mHz). Because of the much lower Nyquist, modelling
the background power spectral density was more challenging but
the duty cycle was approximately three times higher, resulting in a
smaller eﬀect from the window function. We note that we recovered
results in our analysis of the daily averaged data that were consistent
with those from the analysis of the data with a 40-second cadence.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Rotation

From the adjusted posterior distributions for each of the parameters,
acquired through modelling the power spectrum, we were able to
measure the fundamental rotational frequency and linewidth of the
RM component. The latter was assumed to be the same for each
peak.

In Table 1 the median values of marginalised posterior dis-
tributions for each of the model parameters of equation (17) are
displayed. The resultant posterior distributions were approximately
normally distributed and there was no signiﬁcant covariance be-
tween parameters, therefore reported uncertainties on the parame-
ters correspond to the 68 per cent credible intervals either side of
the median in the posterior distributions, adjusted for the systematic
window function eﬀects. In addition, we show the raw data with
the model ﬁt over-plotted in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, on logarithmic and
linear scales, respectively, to highlight the ﬁt over the full frequency
range, and the RM peaks, respectively.

The central frequency of the model, 𝜈0, implies a fundamental
synodic rotation period of 27.11 ± 0.11 days, and hence a sidereal
rotation period of 25.23 ± 0.11 days. The rotation period measured

here is in agreement with other literature for the rotation signal in
the SMMF (Chaplin et al. 2003; Xie et al. 2017).

According to the model for diﬀerential rotation in equa-
tion (A6), the measured rotation period suggests that the observed
SMMF is sensitive to a time-averaged latitude of around 12◦. This
latitude is consistent with those spanned by sunspots and ARs over
the solar activity cycle (Maunder 1904; McIntosh et al. 2014), and
particularly during the declining phase of the solar cycle (Thomas
et al. 2019). This suggests the origin of the RM component of the
SMMF could be linked to active regions.

4.2 Lifetimes

From the measured linewidth of the Lorentzian peaks, we have
calculated the lifetime of the RM component using equation (11).
The linewidth suggests a RM lifetime of 139.6 ± 18.5 days, which is
in the region of ∼ 20 ± 3 weeks. The eﬀects of diﬀerential rotation
and AR migration do not impact our ability to measure the linewidth,
and thus lifetime, of the peaks (as explained in Appendix A).

The typical lifetime of active magnetic regions and sunspots
is on the order of weeks to months (Zwaan 1981; Howard 2001;
Hathaway & Choudhary 2008), therefore the observations of the
SMMF by BiSON measure a lifetime of the RM component which
is consistent with the lifetime of ARs and sunspots. This again
suggests that the RM signal is linked to active regions of magnetic
ﬁeld, suggesting them as a possible source of the signal.

When verifying these results by repeating the analysis with a
daily averaged SMMF (see Section 3.2), the results for the linewidth
were consistent.

5 DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented, for the ﬁrst time, a frequency-domain analysis
of ∼20 years of high-cadence (40-second) BiSON observations of
the SMMF.

The investigation of very high-cadence observations of the
SMMF allowed the exploration of the power spectrum up to
12.5 mHz and the long duration of observations provided near-
nHz resolution in the power spectrum which allowed us to measure
the parameters associated with the rotationally modulated (RM)
component of the SMMF.

We have measured the central frequency of the RM compo-
nent, allowing us to infer the sidereal period of the RM to be
25.23 ± 0.11 days. This rotation period matches to an activity
cycle average latitude of ∼ 12◦, which is in the region of the typical
latitudes for active magnetic regions averaged over the activity cycle
(Maunder 1904; McIntosh et al. 2014; Thomas et al. 2019).

For the ﬁrst time, using the linewidth of the peaks we have

measured the lifetime of the RM component in the SMMF. The
lifetime of the source of the RM component was inferred to be
139.6 ± 18.5 days. This lifetime is consistent with those of active
magnetic regions and sunspots, in the region of weeks to months
(Zwaan 1981; Hathaway & Choudhary 2008).

There has been considerable debate in the literature concerning
the origin of the SMMF. In this study, as the properties of the
RM component are consistent with ARs, we have presented novel
evidence suggesting them as the source of the SMMF.

APPENDIX A: TESTING THE EFFECTS OF
DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION AND MIGRATION

As a result of solar diﬀerential rotation and the migration of ARs
towards the solar equator during the activity cycle, it is understood
that the rotation period of ARs will vary throughout the solar cycle.
As we have inferred that the RM component of the SMMF is
likely linked to ARs, we may therefore assume that the RM com-
ponent is also sensitive to latitudinal migration. Here we analysed
the eﬀect of this migration and diﬀerential rotation on our ability to
make inferences on the lifetime of the RM component.

Several studies have modelled the the solar diﬀerential rotation,
and its variation with latitude and radius of the Sun (see Beck
(2000) and Howe (2009) for in-depth reviews of the literature on
solar diﬀerential rotation). Magnetic features have been shown to
be sensitive to rotation deeper than the photosphere; therefore in
general magnetic features can be seen to rotate with a shorter period
than the surface plasma (Howe 2009).

Chaplin et al. (2008) analysed the eﬀects of diﬀerential rotation
on the shape of asteroseismic 𝑝 modes of oscillation with a low
angular degree (i.e. 𝑙 ≤ 3), and showed that the consequence of
diﬀerential rotation is to broaden the observed linewidth of a mode
peak. The authors provide a model of the resultant proﬁle of a
𝑝 mode whose frequency is shifted in time to be a time-average
of several instantaneous Lorentzian proﬁles with central frequency

where the angled brackets indicate an average over time, 𝐻 and Γ are
the mode height (maximum power spectral density) and linewidth,
respectively, and the full period of observation is given by 𝑇.

Chaplin et al. (2008) also show that by assuming a simple,
linear variation of the unperturbed frequency, 𝜈0, from the start to
the end of the time-series by a total frequency shift Δ𝜈:

𝜈(𝑡) = 𝜈0 + Δ𝜈

the resultant proﬁle of a 𝑝 mode can analytically be modelled by

(A3)

(A4)

(A5)

As the mode linewidths are broadened by this eﬀect, we eval-
uated whether our ability to resolve the true linewidth of the RM,
and hence the lifetime, was aﬀected. In order to evaluate this we
computed the broadened proﬁles given by both equation (A1) and
equation (A3), and ﬁt the model for a single Lorentzian peak, to
determine whether there was a notable diﬀerence in the linewidth.
In the ﬁrst instance, we computed the broadened peak using
equation (A1). Over the duration of the observations, we computed
the daily instantaneous proﬁle, 𝑃(𝜈(𝑡)). The time-averaged proﬁle,
(cid:104)𝑃(𝜈)(cid:105), was a weighted average of each instantaneous proﬁle, where
the weights were given by the squared-daily-SMMF, in order to
allow a larger broadening contribution at times when the SMMF
amplitude is higher.

In the second instance, we computed the broadened peak using
equation (A3). Over the duration of the observations the daily fre-
quency shift, Δ𝜈, was computed. The time-averaged shift, Δ𝜈, was
a weighted average, where again the weightings were given by the
squared-daily-SMMF.

To determine the shift in the rotation rate as the active bands
migrate to the solar equator, we used the model of the solar dif-
ferential rotation as traced by magnetic features (Ω𝑚) given by:

Ω𝑚
2𝜋

= 462 − 74𝜇2 − 53𝜇4 nHz ,

(A6)

where 𝜇 = cos 𝜃 and 𝜃 is the co-latitude (Snodgrass 1983; Brown
et al. 1989).

The time-dependence on the latitude of the active regions used

the best-ﬁtting quadratic model by Li et al. (2001).

In both instances, the broadened peak was modelled as a sin-
gle Lorentzian peak using equation (10). Again, we use emcee
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to explore the posterior parameter
space, with priors similar to the above full-ﬁt on the relevant pa-
rameters.

Figure A1. (a) Shows the peak distribution before and after the time-

peak distribution before and after the analytical broadening, and the ﬁt to
the broadened peak. In both plots the broadened peaks have been shifted by
the relevant frequency to overlay them on top of the true 𝜈0 for comparison.

A1 Results: Time-Averaged Broadened Proﬁle

Over the entire duration of the SMMF observations, the time-
averaged proﬁle was calculated, using equation (A1), and this is
shown in Fig. A1a. The broadened mode used the input parameters
outlined in Table 1, however with the background parameter set to
zero.

By eye, the broadened proﬁle does not appear to have a
signiﬁcantly larger linewidth. The input linewidth was 0.0264 ±
0.0035 𝜇Hz, and the ﬁt to the time-averaged broadened peak pro-
duced a linewidth of 0.0262+0.0038
𝜇Hz. The linewidth of the broad-
−0.0037
ened peak under this method was rather unchanged from that of the
true peak, and both linewidths are within uncertainties of each other.
This result shows that numerically, the mode broadening eﬀect
of diﬀerential rotation and migration does not aﬀect our ability to
resolve the linewidth of the peak, and hence the predicted lifetime
of the RM component of the SMMF.

A2 Results: Analytically Broadened Proﬁle

The time-averaged frequency shift due to diﬀerential rotation was
calculated, much in the same way as equation (A1), to be Δ𝜈 =
0.01285 𝜇Hz. This shift was used to generate the broadened proﬁle
using equation (A3). The broadened mode distribution also used the
input parameters outlined in Table 1, however with the background
parameter set to zero.

Similar to the numerically broadened peak, by eye, the an-
alytically broadened proﬁle does not appear to have a signiﬁ-
cantly larger linewidth (see Fig. A1b). The input linewidth was
0.0264 ± 0.0035 𝜇Hz, and the linewidth of the analytically broad-
ened peak from the ﬁt was 0.0263+0.0038
𝜇Hz, which was within
−0.0037
the uncertainties of the linewidth of the input peak.

This result shows, analytically, the mode broadening eﬀect of
diﬀerential rotation and migration does not aﬀect our ability to
resolve the linewidth of the peak, and hence the lifetime of the RM
component of the SMMF.

A3 Discussion

Both broadening methods applied were shown to have a negligible
eﬀect on the linewidth of the proﬁle, and our ability to resolve the
true linewidth of the peak remains unaﬀected. This result provides
conﬁdence that the measured linewidth in Table 1 was the true
linewidth of the RM peaks, providing the correct lifetime for RM
component, unaﬀected by migration and diﬀerential rotation.
