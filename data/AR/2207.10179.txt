Abstract

In this study, comprehensive calculations of energies, hyperﬁne structure constants, Land´e gJ factors and isotope shifts
have been performed for the lowest 71 states of Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions. Radiative parameters viz., wave-
lengths, transition rates, oscillator strengths and lifetimes are also estimated for the electric and magnetic dipole (E1,M1)
and quadrupole (E2,M2) transitions among these levels. The states under consideration include 1s22s22p6nl for n = 3−9,
l = 0 − 6, and the fully relativistic multiconﬁguration Dirac–Fock (MCDF) method integrated in the latest version of the
general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package (GRASP) is used for the calculations. The relativistic corrections,
viz., Breit interactions and quantum electrodynamics effects are also included in the present work and their effects on
energies and other parameters are analysed. We also examined the impact of including the core-core and core valence
correlations on level energies. Further, to inspect the reliability of our MCDF results, we performed another set of cal-
culations using the many-body perturbation theory inbuilt into the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC). A thorough comparison
between the two obtained calculations and with the previous theoretical and experimental results, wherever available, is
carried out and a good agreement is observed. The present calculations will considerably extend the already existing
results for these Na-like ions as most of the results are reported for the ﬁrst time. Further, we believe that our results are
of high accuracy and will be beneﬁcial for spectral analysis and diagnosis in plasma and astrophysics.

Introduction

Spectroscopy of highly charged ions (HCI) has become an exquisite research topic as knowledge of their atomic structures
and other parameters plays a crucial role in various ﬁelds of science and technology such as astrophysics, lasers, plasma
and collision physics [1]. For instance, HCI may serve as the source of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation for lithography.
Also, they are being used as added impurities for fusion plasma diagnosing, e.g., ET-EFDA. In addition, precise atomic
results such as ﬁne-structure levels, transition parameters, hyperﬁne structure constants, etc., are vital for developing
sophisticated stellar atmosphere models, calculating the opacities and other atmospheric parameters [2] and designing
new atomic clocks. Sodium-like ions are of particular interest as their emission lines are the sources of prominent features
in the spectra of sun [3], high-temperature tokamak plasma and thus have diagnostic applications [4, 5]. Moreover,
these ions are appropriate for examining the electron-correlation and quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects on atomic
properties [6].
However, due to the challenges in experimental techniques for HCI systems, estimation of their atomic parameters relies
primarily on precise theoretical studies. Thus, driven by the vast applications of HCI and the upsurge in demand for their
electronic structure data in astrophysics and projects like ITER, we purpose to carry out a comprehensive study of atomic
parameters for sodium-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions. Their chemical inertness makes them beﬁtting candidates for
use in tokamaks, fusion plasma research and diagnostics. For example, these elements are typically used as trace gases
in reactive plasma to examine the density variation of the radicals formed [7]. Xe and Kr have a rich emission spectrum
and are an indispensable element in developing lasers, laser techniques, and light sources. Further, xenon ions are likely
to be employed as an edge plasma coolant in the ITER fusion reactor and are also being used in gas-discharge lamps,
plasma contactors, spacecraft propulsion [8] and a potential EUV source for next-generation lithography [9]. Krypton
has excellent implications in plasma physics as it is usually employed in ECR ion sources and controlled fusion [10].
It is proposed that injection of Kr in the ITER will assist in cooling the outermost plasma region and reduce erosion by
producing a peripheral radiating mantle. Further, lines of HCIs of Kr and Xe have been observed in tokamak plasma [4].

Moreover, xenon and krypton have been identiﬁed in planetary nebula NGC 7027 [11], hot DO-type white dwarf RE 0503-
289 [12]. The excessive abundance of Xe ions is observed in almost all mercury–manganese stars [13]. Furthermore, Xe
and Kr are neutron(n)-capture elements. Understanding their properties play a crucial role in enhancing the understanding
of nucleosynthesis and mixing processes in the stars, e.g., AGB stars [14, 15] and can provide a way to map the universe’s
chemical evolution [16]. However, a scarcity of reliable atomic results for these trans-iron elements has hindered their
accurate spectra analysis and precise abundance predictions in astrophysical objects [17, 18]. Likewise, argon has been
detected in interstellar clouds [19], stellar atmosphere, solar ﬂares and is one the most abundant elements in the universe
[20]. Lines of Na-like Ar7+ have been detected in radio-loud quasar[21] and in laboratory plasma [22].
Further, various isotopes of Xe, Ar and Kr have been detected in the atmosphere of Sun, Earth, Mars [23], martian
meteoroids [24] and coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko [25]. Hyperﬁne interaction effects also exist in many of
these isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin. These effects can lead to broadening and shifting of the atomic lines and, thus,
are unavoidable for correctly interpreting spectra. Also, hyperﬁne interaction can open up many forbidden transitions,
which are beneﬁcial for improving the plasma models and diagnosis. Results of isotope shifts (IS) and hyperﬁne structures
(HFS) are also integral to study isotope anomalies and understanding nucleosynthesis processes in astronomical objects
[26, 27]. Besides plasma and astrophysical applications, these effects are also signiﬁcant in nuclear physics, e.g., to
estimate the mean-square nuclear charge radii and nuclear quadrupole moment. Further, the strong magnetic ﬁeld in stellar
atmosphere necessitates the knowledge of Land´e gJ factors. Therefore, for understanding the dynamics and properties of
astrophysical objects and laboratory plasma, precise and complete calculations of atomic structures, including the HFS,
IS and Land´e gJ factors, are essential.

To investigate the atomic properties of Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+, several experimental and theoretical studies
have been performed in the recent past. Theoretical work on Na-like ions includes the study of ionization potential
and oscillator strengths (f ) of electric dipole (E1) transition nl − n′l′ (n, n′ ∶ 3 − 4, l, l′ ∶ s − p) for Na iso-electronic
series by Fischer [28] using the multiconﬁgurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method. To ease the reading we omit closed-
shells i.e., 1s22s22p6, for representing the states of Na-like ions. Bi´emont [29] calculated the f values for nl − n′l′
(n, n′ ≤ 8; l, l′ = s, p, d, f ; Z∶ 11 − 26) using the monoconﬁgurational Hartree-Fock (HF) procedure. Godefroid et al. [30]
have estimated the oscillator strengths for 3s 2S − 3d 2D electric quadrupole (E2) lines up to Z = 26 by employing the
MCHF technique. Theodosiou and Curtis [31] calculated the lifetime for 3p and 3d levels of Na-like ions for Z = 11–54,
74, 79, 90, and 92 using the experimental data and MCDF method. Relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT)
was applied by Guet et al. [32] to determine f of 3p − 3s E1 lines for Z = 11 − 29 Na-like ions. Johnson el al. [33]
used the third-order many-body perturbation theory to evaluate the energy and transition rates (A) for 3p − 3s and 4s − 3p
lines for Na-like ions from Z = 3-100. Semi empirical calculations of energies and electric dipole transition probabilities
for Na-like ions (Z = 30 - 60) have been performed by Matsushima et al. [34] using the relativistic parametric potential
approach. Siegel et al. [35] applied monoconﬁgurational Dirac-Fock theory to calculate f values between states with
n = 3 − 5 and l = s, p, d, f of sodium iso-electronic sequence from Na to Ca. Charro and Mart´ın [36] used the relativistic
quantum defect orbital (RQDO) method to compute A values between nl − n′l(n, n′ = 3 − 4) states for Si IV to Kr XXVI
ions . Later, Charro and Mart´ın [37] employed the same method to calculate oscillator strengths for np 2P - n′f 2F
(n = 3 − 5, n′ = 3 − 6) E2 lines of Na-like K8+ to Cs44+ ions. Applying the C1V3 code of Hibbert, Younis et al. [38]
determined the energy levels and dipole oscillator strengths between n = 3 − 5 and l = 0 − 3 levels of Na-like ions up
to krypton. Fischer et al. [39] reported the energy levels, transition probabilities and lifetimes of Ar7+ using the MCDF
method for n = 3 − 4 and l = 0 − 3. Calculations of energies, E1 transitions rates and lifetimes for 5 lowest levels of
Na-like Xe43+ have been done by Vilkas et al. [40] using the relativistic many-body Møller–Plesset perturbation theory.
Sapirstein and Cheng [41] implemented the S-matrix-based QED formalism to calculate the 3s − 3p transition energies of
Na isoelectronic sequence ranging from Z = 30-100. Apart from the structure calculations, Fontes and Zhang [42] used
relativistic distorted wave (RDW) theory to obtain the collision strengths for 10 transitions with n = 3 in the 67 Na-like
ions (Z = 26-92). Electron impact excitation data belonging to nl − n′l(n, n′ = 3 − 6 and l = 0 − 5) have been estimated
for Na-like Mg+ to Kr25+ ions using the intermediate coupling frame transformation R-matrix method by Liang et al.
[43]. They have also computed the level energies, A and weighted oscillator strengths (gf ) among these levels using the
AUTOSTRUCTURE [44] program. Sampson et al. [45] used the Dirac-Fock Slater potential to determine the electronic
radial functions, transition energies and oscillator strengths and further employed the RDW theory to calculate collision
strengths for 3l − nl, n = 4 − 5 states of Z = 22-92 Na-like ions. Further, neglecting the relativistic effects, large-scale
calculations for allowed transition between n ≤ 10 and l ≤ 4 levels of Ar VIII were performed under the Opacity Project
[46]. However, these results are available only for the ﬁne-structure unresolved multiplets.
On experimental front, using the beam-foil technique and ANDC principle, Livingston et al. [47] studied the spectra of
Ar V - Ar VIII using beam-foil excitation and determined the lifetime of 3p and 3d states. Later, Reistad et al. [48]
measured the f values for 3s − 3p transition in Ar VIII and also evaluated the lifetime for 3p 2P1/2,3/2 levels. Gillaspy et
al. [49] measured the wavelength of D lines of Na -like Xe using the NIST electron beam ion trap (EBIT) and also applied
the RMBPT procedure to evaluate the wavelengths of D lines for Na-like ions from argon to uranium. Kink et al. [50]
carried out lifetime measurement of 3p 2P3/2 level of Kr25+ using the beam-foil excitation and cascade-corrected analysis.
Lifetime of 3p and 3d levels of Xe43+ have been measured by Tr¨abert et al. [51] using the time-resolved spectroscopy
of foil-excited ion beams. Later, Tr¨abert et al. [52] measured the wavelengths of Xe43+ at the SuperEBIT. Fahy et al.
[53] performed the extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of Xe ions using NIST EBIT and measured the wavelength of lines

arising from 3s–3p transitions in Xe43+ and other ionic states. Osin et al. [54] identiﬁed n = 3 - n′ = 3 transitions from
Ni-like to Na-like xenon at the NIST EBIT and measured the corresponding wavelengths.
Reader et al. [55] measured the wavelength of 3s − 3p, 3p − 3d and 3d − 4f transitions in Kr25+ using the photographing
laser-produced plasmas and tokamak plasmas with grazing-incidence spectrographs. Further, they extrapolated their
results by least square ﬁtting to estimate the wavelengths of Ar7+ to Xe43+. Wavelengths of 3s − 3p emission lines of
Kr25+ have been measured by Kondo et al.[56] in the Alcator C tokamak plasmas.
Studies on HFS, IS and Land´e gJ factors are scarce, particularly for higher excited levels. Dutta and Majumder [57] used
the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory and calculated the HFS constants AJ and BJ of states with conﬁguration
nl(n = 3 and l = 0 − 2) for Na-like Si to V ions. They also studied the electron correlation effects on HFS. Using the
RMBPT method Safronova and Johnson [58] derived the ﬁeld shift (FS) and speciﬁc mass shift (SMS) constants for
3s, 3p and 3d levels in sodium like ions with Z = 12 - 18 and Z = 26. Tupitsyn et al. [59] reported the FS and SMS for
3p1/2 − 3s1/2 transition of Na-like Ar and Xe ions by performing large-scale conﬁguration interaction Dirac-Fock (CIDF)
calculations. Using the EBIT facility at NIST, Silwal et al. [60, 61] measured the mass shifts (MS) and FS for D1 and D2
transitions between sodium like 124Xe and 136Xe ions.
An evident scarcity of the results of the atomic structures for higher excited states of sodium-like ions can be pictured
from the studies mentioned above, especially for Xe and Kr; only a few are fully relativistic. Further, there is a lack
of results on transition parameters of forbidden spectral lines, HFS, IS and Land´e gJ factors. However, beside allowed
transitions, results on forbidden lines are vital for determining precise lifetimes of energy levels, effective and accurate
plasma modeling. Also, due to the non-zero nuclear spin of numerous isotopes of these noble gasses, precise spectral
analysis demands hyperﬁne structures and isotope shift factors. Therefore, we will provide complete and comprehensive
results for energy levels, (E1,M1) and (E2,M2) transition probabilities, lifetime, HFS constants AJ -BJ , Land´e gJ and IS
factors for Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions in this work. An evident scarcity of the atomic structures results for higher
excited states of sodium-like ions can be pictured from the studies mentioned above, especially for Xe and Kr; only few are
fully relativistic. Transitions parameters of a small number of forbidden and allowed spectral lines are available. Further,
there is a paucity of results on HFS, IS and Land´e gJ factors. However, due to the non zero nuclear spin and presence
of numerous isotopes of these noble gasses, precise spectral analysis demands for the hyperﬁne structures and isotope
shift factors. Therefore, we will provide complete and comprehensive results for energy levels, (E1,M1) and (E2,M2)
transition probabilities, lifetime, HFS constants AJ -BJ , Land´e gJ and IS factors for Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+
ions in this work. In this connection, we implement the MCDF procedure to perform a systematic and fully relativistic
calculations for the lowest 71 levels of these ions. The Breit interaction, QED effects, normal and speciﬁc mass shift
corrections are also taken into consideration to enhance the accuracy of calculated parameters. The conﬁguration of our
interest includes 1s22s22p6nl, where n = 3 − 9 and l = 0 − 6. Energy levels, HFS constants AJ -BJ and IS are estimated
for all the above mentioned levels. All the parameters mentioned earlier are calculated using GRASP2018 package [62]
except for IS, for which RIS4 module [63] is employed. To examine the reliability of our results, we have performed
similar calculations using the many body perturbation theory (MBPT) inbuilt in ﬂexible atomic code (FAC)[64]. A good
agreement is achieved by comparing the two results and also with the available previous results. We also analyse the
effect of correlations by considering the core-valence and core-core correlations for Na-like Xe43+. We believe that our
calculations are precise enough to be used in studying the plasma properties, chemical abundance of stars and stellar
atmosphere modeling.

2 Theory

2.1 The MCDF-RCI method

We have given here only a brief description of the methods applied in the present calculations. Although theoretical details
are widely available in the literature, they can also be followed from previous papers [62, 65, 66].
The MCDF method is based on the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian, which for an N electron system is written as,

HDC =

N
∑
s=1

[cαs ⋅ ps + (βs − 1)c2 + V nuc

s

] +

N
∑
s<t

.

(1)

Here, α and β are the 4 x 4 Dirac matrices and ps is the momentum operator of the sth electron. V nuc and c are the
electron-nucleus interaction potential and the speed of light, respectively. The last term denotes the electron-electron
Coulomb interaction.
The atomic state functions (ASFs), describing the energy states for N electrons, are derived as a linear combination of the
conﬁguration state functions (CSFs),

∣Ψ⟩ =

NCSF
∑
s=1

es∣γsP JMJ ⟩,

(2)

where es are the mixing coefﬁcients. P , J and MJ represent the parity, total angular momentum quantum number and
its associated magnetic quantum number, respectively. γ refers to the occupation number and all other appropriate quan-

3

tum labels that are required to uniquely specify a CSF. These CSFs are in-turn built from the anti-symmetric products of
Dirac’s one-electron orbitals.
Employing the variational principle method and the relativistic self consistent ﬁeld (RSCF) procedure, the radial com-
ponents of one electron orbitals and the mixing coefﬁcients are optimised to self consistency. Further, to perform the
relativistic conﬁguration interaction (RCI) calculations, the Breit interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) ef-
fects, viz., self-energy, vacuum polarization, and speciﬁc mass shift corrections are also added to the Dirac-Coulomb
Hamiltonian (equation(1)).

All the further atomic structure properties like transition rates, hyperﬁne structure constants, Land´e gJ factors, and

isotope shift factors can be estimated from the ASFs and are brieﬂy described in the following sections.

2.1.1 Transition parameters

The line parameters for a transition between upper u and lower l states, can be expressed in terms of the reduced matrix
elements of operator (O) corresponding to the multipole expansion of electron-photon interaction [67],

⟨u∣∣Oq

ξ ∣∣l⟩.

(3)

Here ξ is the rank of the operator. Its values can be 0 or 1, which deﬁnes the electric or magnetic type of multipole.
Further, q is 1 and 2, referring to the dipole and quadrupole transitions. By applying the Racah algebra, these matrices
can be further simpliﬁed into a weighted sum over radial integrals and the weights can be obtained by performing angular
integration. We have studied only electric and magnetic dipole (q =1) and quadrupole (q =2) transitions in the present
work.

2.1.2 Hyperﬁne structures and Land´e gJ factors

The hyperﬁne constants AJ and BJ are deﬁned as,

AJ =

µI
I

√

(J(J + 1))

⟨γP J∣∣T (1)∣∣γP J⟩,

BJ = 2QI

√

√

J(2J − 1)

⟨γP J∣∣T (2)∣∣γP J⟩,

(4)

(5)

where µI and QI are the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments, respectively. T (k) is a spherical
tensor operator in the electron space having a rank k [68]. In this study, only the diagonal hyperﬁne components are
considered. Further, the Land´e gJ factor determines the splitting of the magnetic levels in the presence of an external
magnetic ﬁeld and can be written as [66],

gJ =

(6)

where Γ and α are the relativistic spin matrix and ﬁne-structure constant, respectively. X refers to a spherical tensor. The
values of the spin g factor, gspin, is 2.00232.

2.1.3 Isotope shift

The difference in the atomic transition frequencies of the isotopes of an atom is predominantly due to the difference in the
masses and nuclear charge distributions of the isotopes and are called mass shift and ﬁeld shift, respectively.
The mass shift correction operator HM S is given as, [69],

HM S =

1
2M

N
∑
s,t

(ps ⋅ pt −

αZ
rs

(αs +

(αs ⋅ rs)rs
r2
s

) ⋅ pt) .

(7)

Equation 7 can be further separated into the one body (s = t) and two body (s ≠ t) terms, corresponding to the NMS and
SMS, respectively. For two isotopes A and A′ of mass M and M ′, the level mass shift can be written as,

δEA,A′

i,M S = δEA,A′

i,NM S − δEA,A′

i,SM S =

M − M ′
M M ′ KM S ,

where KM S is the electronic factor deﬁned as,

KM S
M

= ⟨γP JMJ ∣HM S∣γP JMJ ⟩

.

(8)

(9)

The energy shift due to different nuclear charge radii of two isotopes A and A′ for a particular atomic state, is,

where F s is the ﬁeld shift factor given by,

δEs

A,A′ = F s(⟨r2⟩A − ⟨r2⟩A′) ,

F s =

2π

4π(cid:15)o

) ∆∣Ψ(O)∣2
s .

Here ∆∣Ψ(O)∣2

s is the electron probability density at origin for the state s.

(10)

(11)

2.2 The MBPT approach

The present work also implements the MBPT method included in the Flexible Atomic Code [64] to calculate the electronic
structure parameters. It is based on no-pair Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian, written as,

HDCB =

N
∑
s=1

[hd(s) −

Z
rs

] + ∑
s<t

(

1
rst

+ Bst) ,

(12)

where hd is one electron Dirac Hamiltonian and Bst is the Breit interaction. Further, the Hamiltonian in equation 12 is
divided into a perturbation V and model Hamiltonian Ho, given by,

and

Ho =

N
∑
s=1

[hd(s) + U (rs)] ,

V =

N
∑
s=1

[

Z
rs

+ U (rs)] + ∑
s<t

(

1
rst

+ Bst) .

(13)

(14)

Here U (r) is a model potential including the screening effect of all the electrons and should be chosen appropriately to
make V as small as possible. The prime feature of the MBPT method is to divide the Hilbert space of the Hamiltonian into
M and N orthogonal spaces. Here M represents the model space containing the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian and
N includes the perturbation expansion. The electron correlation effects are accounted for within the M space, while the
perturbation method is applied to work out the interaction between M and N model space. Eigenvalues in second-order
are acquired by solving the generalized ﬁrst-order effective Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem.

3 Computational procedure

We performed the calculations for the lowest 71 levels having the conﬁgurations 1s22s22p6nl for n = 3 − 9, l = 0 − 6
of Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions using the MCDF method inbuilt in GRASP2018 [62]. These states are grouped
according to their parity and independent calculations in extended optimal level (EOL) scheme are performed for the
even and odd sets. The multi-reference (MR) set for odd states includes 34 levels which are built with the conﬁgurations
1s22s22p6nl for n = 3 − 9, l = p, f, h. Similarly, the even parity states contain 37 levels pertaining to the conﬁgurations
1s22s22p6nl for n = 3 − 9, l = s, d, g, i, making these as the even MR set. The initial calculations are performed on the
MR sets, which account for the static electron correlations. In the next step, expansion of CSFs is done in a restrictive
active space approach, by single and double substitutions of electrons from the MR set orbitals to higher orbitals upto
n = 11 and l = s − i and forms the active space (AS). The 1s orbital is considered as inactive core, whereas the 2s and 2p
orbitals are taken as the active core. The core-valence and valence-valence correlations are considered due to excitation
from 2s22p6 and nl orbitals of the MR set. To monitor the convergence of the computed electronic structure parameters,
the active space are divided into layers of the same n and all the corresponding orbital quantum numbers upto l = 6.
So, we deﬁne the AS’s as, AS{10} and As{11} with n = 3 − 10 and n = 3 − 11, respectively. Both AS{10} and As{11}
have l = s, p, d, f, g, h, i. For each AS, only the outer orbitals are optimized while the inner ones are kept frozen. The
number of CSFs generated for AS{10}/AS{11} is 53352/71820 and 47191/63339 for even and odd parities, respectively.
Further, we incorporate the transverse photon interaction and QED effects by performing the RCI calculations. Since the
calculations are done in the jj−coupling scheme, we transform the levels to LS−coupling scheme to ease their identiﬁ-
cation and comparisons with other’s results. Also, due to the non-orthogonality of initial and ﬁnal states, biorthogonal
transformations are performed on the odd and even sets to remove the complexities in estimating transition probabilities.
The speciﬁc mass shift, normal mass shift and ﬁeld shift are calculated using RIS4. Though it is a sub program written
for GRASP2K [70], we did the required modiﬁcations to use it in alliance with GRASP2018 code.
To demonstrate the correlation effects, we choose Xe43+, which is expected to be the best candidate among the three ions

5

considered in the present work. In this regard, we performed calculations by simultaneously considering the valence-
valence, core-valence and core-core correlations with a restriction that correlation orbitals will always have at least two
electrons. The CSFs generated for AS{10}/AS{11} are 933241/1099439 and 726101/853388 for even and odd sets,
respectively. These exceedingly large number of CSFs make the computations time-consuming and constrain the compu-
tational resources. To mitigate such a situation, we rearranged the CSFs into the zero and ﬁrst-order spaces. We consider
the full interaction of the CSFs in the zero-order space, while only the diagonal interaction due to the CSFs in the ﬁrst-
order space is included.
Furthermore, we performed the MBPT calculations using FAC as an additional accuracy test of our results. The 1s22p6nl
conﬁgurations for n = 3 to 9 and the corresponding orbital quantum numbers are considered in the model space M. All
the possible conﬁgurations originated by single and double substitutions from the M space in the N space are considered.
Further, the leading order corrections like vacuum polarization, self-energy, etc. are also taken into account in addition to
HDCB in equation 12.

4 Results

4.1 Energy levels

We carried out systematic MCDF-RCI calculations for AS{9} to AS{11} to determine the energies of the lowest 71
levels of Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+. The corresponding AS label deﬁnes the calculated energies for each active
space. Further, to examine the importance of relativistic corrections, we performed another set of calculations for AS{11}
without incorporating the Breit, QED and other corrections (labeled as AS{11} MCDF). Furthermore, to ascertain the
accuracy of our results, independent calculations are performed using the MBPT approach. A thorough comparison with
the previously available results and a detailed analysis of each ion are presented in the following subsections.

4.1.1 Ar7+

We compare the present energy values for Ar7+ in Table 1 with the MCDF results for 12 levels reported by Fischer et
al.[39], R-matrix calculations of Liang et al.[43] for 32 levels and the corresponding results available at the NIST[71]
data base. For an enhanced analysis, the deviation of the present (AS{9} to AS{11}, AS{11} MCDF and MBPT) and
previous [39, 43] results relative to the NIST values are shown in Fig. 1 (a). We ﬁnd a fair convergence of our results
with mean absolute deviations of 0.45%, 0.16%, 0.13% and 0.16% for AS{9}-AS{11} and AS{11} MCDF, respectively.
The present AS{11} values show a maximum difference of 1.17% for 9s state but differ by less than 0.15% for all
the other states. The results of Fischer et al.[39] and Liang et al.[43] have average variations of 0.30% and 0.35%,
respectively, as compared to the NIST values. Further, the present MBPT results deviate by 0.32% and 0.42% relative
to the NIST and the present AS{11} energies, respectively. Furthermore, the energies at opacity database [46] were
available for multiplets. Therefore, we converted our AS{11}, MBPT and NIST energies of the ﬁne structure levels to
their corresponding multiplets. To compare these results, in Fig.1 (b) the relative difference of present AS{11}, MBPT and
opacity [46] results with respect to the NIST values is displayed. Energies from [46] show an absolute mean discrepancy
of 0.74% and a max difference of about 2%. Therefore, our results are more precise, as evident from Fig.1 (b). Large
deviation in energies can lead to a fallacious prediction of stellar and plasma properties. Our results for almost all the

7

levels are more accurate than that of [39, 43, 46] and hence are of prime importance for stellar and plasma modeling.
Moreover, we also provide energies of few ﬁne structure levels which are missing in the NIST database.

Figure 1: (a) Relative percentage deviation from the present AS{9}(star), AS{10}(plus), AS{11}(circle), AS{11} MCDF
(triangle left), MBPT (triangle right) and previous work of Fischer et al.[39] (tri down) and Liang et al.[43]
(triangle down) with respect to the NIST [71] values. (b) Relative percentage deviation in energy (for multiplets) from
the present AS{11}, MBPT and opacity database [46] (square) with respect to the NIST [71] values for Ar7+.

Table 2: The present MCDF-RCI and MBPT energies as a function of increasing active space for lowest 71 levels of
Kr25+ and the values of NIST [71], Younis et al.[38] and Liang et al. [43].

4.1.2 Kr25+

For sodium-like Kr25+ results of only 28 levels (excluding the excited core levels) were available at the NIST, while
Younis et al. [38] and Liang et al. [43] have reported energies of the lowest 20 and 32 levels respectively. The present
MCDF-RCI and MBPT results for each active space, the values available from the NIST, CIV3 [38] and R-matrix [43]
calculations are tabulated in Table. 2. Further, the relative difference in energies of the present and previous [38, 43]
results with respect to the NIST values is displayed pictorially in Fig. 2(a). To distinguish the different results we did not
include AS{9} values in Fig. 2(a) as the maximum deviation is found to be 6% for AS{9}, although the mean deviation
is 0.88% only. It is noticeable from the ﬁgure that the present calculations converge well towards the NIST values with an
increase in the active space and show mean difference of 0.091% and 0.032% for AS{10} and AS{11}, respectively. The
agreement with the NIST results improves from 0.15% AS{11} MCDF to 0.032% as we move from AS{11} MCDF to
AS{11} calculations. However, the RCI calculations introduce a remarkable rectiﬁcation for the lowest four levels from
0.7% to 0.05%. This makes the importance of including the relativistic corrections for Kr25+ abundantly clear. In our
MBPT calculations, the mean discrepancy is only 0.079% and 0.05% relative to the NIST and the present AS{11} results,
respectively. Such an excellent agreement between the two theories further validates the accuracy of our calculations.
Younis et al. [38] and Liang et al.[43] have mean deviations of 0.43% and 0.14%, respectively, which are more than our
results. Moreover, energies reported in [38] for a few levels show relatively large differences. For example, energy for
3p 2P1/2 state strays by 3.8% in [38] whereas, the corresponding value deviates only by 0.06%, 0.23% and 1.37% in the

9

present AS{11}, MBPT and R-matrix [43] calculations, respectively. An excellent agreement of our calculated energies
for Kr25+ ion with the NIST assists in establishing the reliability of the other electronic structure parameters determined
in this work. Moreover, the results for 1s22s22p6nl levels, where n = 7 − 9 and l = 0 − 6, are reported for the ﬁrst time.

Table 3: The present MCDF-RCI and MBPT energies as a function of increasing active space for lowest 71 levels of
Xe43+ and the values of NIST [71] and Vilkas et al.[40] .

4.1.3 Xe43+

Table. 3 displays comparison of our calculated energies for Na-like Xe43+ ion with the previous results of the four levels
reported by Vilkas et al. [40] using the relativistic many-body møller–plesset perturbation theory and 28 levels available
at the NIST database. Similar to Ar7+ and Kr25+, we show the relative percentage deviation of the two theoretical works
with respect to NIST values in Fig. 2 (b). Clearly, agreement with the NIST results improves with increment in the AS
except for the ﬁrst four levels where the deviation in AS{9} is the least. However, the absolute mean deviation is only
0.08% in case of AS{11} compared to that obtained for AS{9} (0.1%), AS{10} (0.09%), and AS{11} MCDF (0.22%).
Therefore, we ﬁnd that the quality of the wavefunctions and hence, the electronic parameters get enhanced by including
the relativistic corrections. Although the mean error in MBPT results is slightly less than the AS{11} calculations, the
two results digress only by 0.06% and thus, are in excellent agreement.

Energies calculated by Vilkas et al.[40] for 3p levels show better agreement with the NIST values than the present
calculations. However, for 3d states, our results better match the corresponding NIST energies. Overall, we can say that
the present calculations provide fairly precise energies along with the new results for 41 levels for Xe43+.
Further, a thorough examination of Fig. 1 (a), 2 (a) and 2 (b), afﬁrms the dominant role of relativistic effects in heavy

11

ions. The relative difference in AS{11} MCDF and AS{11} increases from 0.03% in Ar7+ to 0.13% and 0.26% in Kr25+
and Xe43+, respectively. Therefore, including the relativistic effects in the atomic structure calculations becomes essential
with increase in nuclear charge.

4.2 Transition parameters

Using the MCDF-RCI method, we calculated the wavelengths, transition rates and oscillator strengths corresponding to
E1, M1, E2 and M2 transitions among the 1s22s22p6nl for n = 3 − 9 and l = s, p, d, f, g, h, i levels of Na-like Ar7+,
Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions. The transition probabilities are obtained using the Coulomb and Babushkin gauges. We present
the results through Tables 4 - 6 in the Babushkin gauge only, while Coulomb gauge results are used to determine the
uncertainty parameter dT. It appraises the uncertainty in the obtained transition rates and is given by

dT =

∣AB − AC∣
max(AB, AC)

,

(15)

where AB and AC are the transition rates in the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges, respectively. We do not report the
transition rates having values smaller than 104 for E2, M1 and M2 transitions. Since E1 transitions are considered more
important than the forbidden transitions, therefore, as an additional validation of the present results, we performed similar
calculations using the MBPT technique. Detailed analysis of radiative parameters for each ion is as follows.

respect to NIST database [71]. (c) The E1 dT parameter, (d) The relative percentage deviation in present RCI and Liang
et al. [43] values of E2 transition rates, for Ar7+

4.2.1 Ar7+

For Ar7+, after neglecting the transition with A ≤ 104 s−1, the radiative parameters of 377 and 250 lines are computed for
E1 and E2 type transitions, respectively, and are presented in Tables S1-S2 (supplementary data). Since all the possible
magnetic transitions among the states under consideration have A smaller than 104 s−1, these are not shown in Tables

12

S1-S2. A detailed comparison of the present (RCI and MBPT) and previous results of Siegel et al. [35], Fischer et al.[39],
Liang et al.[43], NIST [71] and CAMBD [72] for E1 lines is shown in Table 4. We observe that the present wavelengths
are in excellent agreement with those of [72] and show a mean deviation of only 0.16%. Further, the gf values from the
present work and Siegel et al. [35] are also in excellent agreement. Furthermore, in Fig.3(a), we display the consistency
between the transition rates calculated using the RCI and MBPT theories. The two theoretical results primarily lie within
20%; however, more deviations are observed for a few weak lines with A < 109 s−1. For a more effective analysis,
we demonstrate the comparison of the present transition rates and other previous results [39, 43] with respect to the
NIST values in Fig. 3(b). Our results are fairly consistent with the NIST values except for 3d 2D5/2 − 4p 2p3/2 and
3d 2D3/2 − 4p 2p1/2 lines. However, all the theoretical results match reasonably well for these transitions. The estimated
uncertainty for the NIST A values lies within 18-25%. In fact, for a few transitions, the accuracy range extends up to
50%. Hence, our results are within the experimental uncertainties and can be considered reliable. To further establish the
accuracy of our calculations for E1 transitions, the dT parameter is shown in Fig. 3 (c). Since its value lies below 0.05
for most cases, one can rely on the accuracy of the present results. Further, our calculated E2 transition probabilities are
compared in Fig 3 (d) with the corresponding values available only for 83 lines from Liang et al [43]. We display only 50
transitions here, for which the deviation is below 40%. Except for a few transitions, the two theories show a reasonable
agreement. Although Charro and Mart´ın [36] had also reported E2 transition probabilities, we found that their calculations
deviate signiﬁcantly from the present as well as previous [43] results. Therefore, these results [36] are not displayed in Fig
3 (d). Overall, most of the present radiative parameters are consistent with previous values in the literature. Furthermore,
the radiative parameters of few allowed and forbidden lines of Ar7+ are also reported for the ﬁrst time.

et al. [35], NIST [71] and CAMBD atomic database[72] for Ar7+ .

4.2.2 Kr25+

For Kr25+, the number of E1, M1, E2 and M2 transitions among the presently considered levels are 481, 36, 524 and 102,
respectively. The radiative parameters for these lines are given in Tables S3-S4 of the supplementary data.

Table 5, shows a thorough analysis of our calculated and previously reported E1 transition parameters [43, 45, 71, 72].
The present wavelengths agree extremely well with results of 26 and 41 lines available at the NIST [71] and CAMBD[72]
databases with an average deviation of 0.049% and 0.045%, respectively. Our weighted oscillator strengths have a mean
deviation of only 2.71% relative to the theoretical results of Sampson et al. [45], with only six transitions exhibiting a
variation above 5%. Liang et al. [43] also reported gf values and mentioned that their results agree within 20% with [45].
Since our results also show a similar comparison with these R-matrix calculations [43] for gf, the latter are not included
in Table 5.

The present A values for E1 transitions lie primarily within 10% of those reported by Liang et al. [43] with a few
exceptions. However, signiﬁcant discrepancies are encountered in comparing the transition rates of Younis et al. [38] with
both present, and the R-matrix [43] values. Therefore, we do not report a full comparison with [38]. A good agreement
of our results with [43] supports the accuracy of our calculations. Further, to clarify the ambiguity, we calculated the
E1 transition probability by MBPT method using FAC and found a good agreement with the RCI values as displayed in
Fig.4 (a). Moreover, in Fig 4 (b), we evaluated the uncertainty in the E1 A values from length (Coulomb) and velocity
(Babushkin) gauges.
It is evident that a profusion of transitions has low dT values (less than 0.1); hence, brace the
accuracy of our calculations.

E1 dT parameter, (c) The relative absolute percentage deviation in the present RCI and Liang et al. [43] values of E2
transition rates, for Kr25+

The present E2 transition probabilities show a good agreement with Liang et al. [43] and are displayed in Fig 4 (c).
We found large discrepancies in the RQDO A values of Charro and Mart´ın [36] relative to both the present and previous
[43] results and hence, did not include those for comparison. Similar behavior was seen for Ar7+. This could be due to
the non-inclusion of indirect relativistic effects in RQDO method as mentioned in [36].

Further, we compared the present E2 oscillator strengths with the multiplets results from another work of Charro and
Mart´ın [37] based on the RQDO procedure. The relative percentage deviation between the two results is displayed in Fig5
and a fair consistency (within 22%) is evident.

4.2.3 Xe43+

The transition parameters of 462, 92, 534 and 270 lines for E1, M1, E2 and M2 transitions, respectively, of Xe43+, are
tabulated in Tables S5-S6 (Supplementary data).

Table 6, presents comprehensive comparison of the present and previous [71, 73, 45, 33, 40] results for wavelengths,
It is evident that our results are in good

E1 transition probabilities and corresponding weighted oscillator strengths.

agreement with the wavelengths of 4 transitions listed at NIST and have a maximum difference of 0.866 ˚A for 3p 2P1/2
- 3s 2S1/2 line. The wavelengths of 34 allowed transitions from the earlier work [34] available at the SPECTRA-W3
database [73] shows an excellent match with the present results within a marginal difference of 0.009 ˚A. The present gf
values also agree with the theoretical calculations of [45]. The most considerable difference of 0.058 between the two
results occurs for 4f 2F7/2 - 3d 2D5/2 line, whereas the mean difference is found to be only 0.007. Further, the mean
deviation in our transition rates are within 2.0% and 0.8% on comparing with the results reported by Vilkas et al. [40] for
ﬁve lines and Johnson et al. [33] for four lines, respectively. The relative deviation in the MBPT to RCI transition rates
is shown in Fig. 6(a). The average difference between the present two results is only 1.96%. However, a few transitions
digress by more than 10%. The transition 3d 2D5/2 - 9p 2P3/2 deviated the most by 19%. This inconsistency could be due
to the difference in the conﬁguration interaction effects considered in the two physical models. Further, the uncertainty
dT in E1 transition rates is illustrated in Fig 6(b). The majority of E1 transitions are below the dT value of 0.01. Hence,
our results of transition rates from the length and velocity gauges are in excellent agreement with a mean uncertainty (dT)
of 0.003% for E1 transitions.

Figure 6: (a) The relative absolute percentage deviation in the present MBPT values with respect to RCI results, (b) The
E1 dT parameter, for Xe43+

Comparison of the present E2 oscillator strengths with the multiplet f values from Charro and Mart´ın [37] is shown
in Fig 5. Our results agree well for almost all the transitions, except for 4f − 4p and 5p − 4f lines that stray relatively
larger by 24% and 16% from the present results. This is possibly due to the small value ( 10−06) of oscillator strengths
corresponding to these lines. Overall, the agreement among all the results is pretty satisfactory. To our knowledge, no
other comprehensive results exist for Na-like Xe43+ ion; hence, most radiative parameters are new.

4.3 Lifetime

The lifetime (τ ) of a level l is given as,

τl =

1
ΣuAul

,

(16)

where the summation is over the transition probabilities of E1, E2, M1 and M2 transitions. The lifetimes calculated
for the presently considered levels of Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ are tabulated in Table S7 (supplementary data).
For a few levels, theoretical [31, 40] and experimental [50, 51] results are available for comparison. Therefore, our
calculated lifetimes are compared with these studies in Table. 7. Our results for Xe43+ have an excellent match with the
corresponding values of Vilkas et al. [40]. However, these are within 1.4%, 0.8% and 3%, for Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+,
respectively, in comparison to the results of Theodosiou and Curtis [31]. Further, the present lifetimes for the levels of
Kr25+ and Xe43+ also show a good agreement with the measurements of Kink et al.[50] and Tr¨abert et al. [51] and lie
within the experimental uncertainties.

al.[51] and Kink et al.[50] for Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions.

Further, we perform an accuracy check by plotting the ratio of lifetimes (τb/τc) for all the 71 levels in the length and
velocity gauges in Figs. 7 (a), (b) and (c), for Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+, respectively. For Xe43+, the ratio is close to one for
most of the levels and the largest value is 1.06 for 3p 2P1/2 state. Similarly, for Kr25+ and Ar7+, the majority of levels have
a ratio near to one. The maximum differences of 0.86 and 0.87 occur for the 9d 2D5/2 and 9s 2S1/2 states, respectively.
Overall we ﬁnd a decent consistency between the lifetime results calculated from the two gauges.

4.4 Hyperﬁne Interaction constants and Land´e gJ Factors

Using the GRASP2018, we computed the hyperﬁne constants (AJ and BJ ), and Land´e gJ factors for the 71 levels of the
presently studied Na-like inert gas ions. To provide generalized results, we assumed the nuclear magnetic and quadrupole
moments to equal one. Table S8 (supplementary data) represents our RCI results of AJ /µ,BJ /Q, and Land´e gJ factors for
all the there ions. The comparison of the present values with the only available RCC calculations of Dutta and Majumder
[57] for Ar7+ is shown in Table 8. AJ and BJ /Q have been reported for only 3s, 3p and 3d states in [57]. The maximum
absolute difference between the present and RCC values is observed for the 3p 2P3/2 state where AJ /µI and BJ //Q stray
by 40.5 (MHz/units of µI ) and 28.9 (Mhz/b), respectively. Further, Dutta and Majumder [57] also calculated the HFS
for the Dirac-Fock (DF) reference states without considering the correlations and Gaunt corrections. Hence, we carried
out similar MCDF calculations of HFS for the MR set AS{9} labelled as MCDF AS{9}. The comparison of these two
results is also given in Table.8. An excellent agreement with a maximum relative deviation of 0.1% exists between the
present MCDF AS{9} and previous DF BJ /Q values. However, our RCI AJ /µI values exhibit a better match with the
RCC calculations [57] as compared to the agreement between the MCDF AS{9} and DF results [57]. Therefore, the
slight variation between the RCI and RCC results could be due to the correlation and relativistic corrections considered in
these two calculations.

ing results of Dutta and Majumder [57] for Ar7+

Since the study of hyperﬁne interactions is a valuable probe to the QED effects; therefore, to analyze this, we present
the ratio of HFS constants calculated with and without including QED corrections in Fig. 8 for all three ions. The ratio
is maximum for Xe43+ and slightly comparable for Ar7+ and Kr25+. The observation supports the fact that heavy ions are
more sensitive to QED effects.

Further, to the best of our knowledge, there are no other studies involving the estimation of HFS and Land´e gJ factors
of higher levels of Na-like ions. Therefore we can say that most parameters are the ﬁrst report. Since hyperﬁne constants
are crucial for precise abundance estimation, and line modeling and Land´e gJ factors are requisite for exploring magnetic
ﬁelds in hot stars, we believe our results will beneﬁt such studies and be helpful for comparisons for future works.

Isotope Shifts

Using the RIS4 module, we computed the electronic factors corresponding to normal mass, speciﬁc mass, and ﬁeld shifts
for the 71 levels of Na-like Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions. We listed them in Table S9 (supplementary data). Previous
results of IS factors are available from the MBPT calculations of Safronova and Johnson [58] for Ar7+, CIDF results
of Tupitsyn et al. [59] for Ar7+ and Xe43+, and RMBPT and GRASP values of Silwal et al. [60] for Xe43+. Table. 9
displays comparison of the present and aforementioned studies [58, 59, 60]. We observed that our calculated FS values
show an excellent agreement with [59], but the SMS results have a relative error of 5.7% and 2.4% in Ar7+ and Xe43+,
respectively. A minimum and maximum deviation of 0.3% and 2% is noticed in present FS results of Ar7+ when compared
with Safranova and Johnson [58] values. In contrast, for SMS parameters, the difference goes up to 15%. Further, our IS
value for the D1 line of Xe43+ deviates only by 0.5% and 0.4% with the GRASP2K and RMBPT calculations from Silwal
et al. [60], respectively. Altogether, a reasonably good agreement exists between the present and previous results.

Further in Fig.9 (a), (b) and (c), we have analysed the trend in FS, SMS and NMS factors of the three Na-like ions
for few allowed transitions among the n = 3 and n = 4 levels. It can be clearly observed that the IS factors for Xe43+ are
the order of magnitudes more than those of Ar7+ and Kr25+. Moreover, a difference in the sign of FS factor is seen in
Kr25+ for 3d 2D3/2 − 3p 2P3/2 and 3d 2D5/2 − 3p 2P3/2 transitions. For these lines, the FS is positive for Ar7+ and Xe43+,
whereas it is negative for Kr25+. Somewhat similar trend is observed in 3d 2D3/2 − 3p 2P1/2 and 4d 2D3/2 − 3p 2P1/2
lines where the FS value changes from positive in Ar7+ to negative in Kr25+ and Xe43+. The possible reason for these
features could be the J dependence of these transitions and can be subjected to further investigations in future studies of
Na-like iso-electronic series. The plots for SMS and NMS show no such trends. Most of the present results are arrived at
ﬁrst in the literature for all three ions. Also, we are conﬁdent that our calculated IS parameters will be signiﬁcant in stellar
modeling, heavy-ion storage experiments, and the investigation of nuclear charge radii.

5 Conclusions

We performed a systematic computation of level energies, lifetimes, multipole radiative rates, transition wavelengths,
hyperﬁne constants, Land´e gJ and isotope shift factors for 71 states of the nl n ≤ 9; l ≤ 6 conﬁgurations of Na-like Ar7+,
Kr25+ and Xe43+ ions. The MCDF-RCI method is implemented to carry out these calculations using the GRASP2018 and
its module RIS4. A large section of the present results of the three ions is reported for the ﬁrst time. The gross absence of
previous theoretical or experimental results led us to carry out similar independent calculations using the MBPT theory
to establish our MCDF-RCI results’ accuracy. The average deviations between the present MCDF-RCI and MBPT level
energies are 0.427%, 0.05% and 0.06% for Ar7+, Kr25+, and Xe43+, respectively. The transition rates computed using
the MCDF-RCI and MBPT approach are within 10% agreement for most of the lines, which conﬁrms the reliability of
the present MCDF-RCI and MBPT results. Further, a good agreement is obtained in comparing our results with the
corresponding values from NIST, Spectra W3, CAMBD atomic database, and other previous theoretical and experimental
studies, wherever available. The absolute mean difference of only 0.13%, 0.03% and 0.08% in the present MCDF-RCI
energies is observed with reference to the NIST values for Ar7+, Kr25+ and Xe43+, respectively. Our calculated lifetimes in
the length and velocity gauges are highly consistent and agree well with the other results. There is a good match between
our HFS and IS results with the earlier theoretical and experimental works. We believe that the present calculations
are accurate and comprehensive. These results will fulﬁll the demand for atomic parameters for HCI and will also be
beneﬁcial in studying chemical abundance in space, spectra analysis, and diagnosis of plasma.
