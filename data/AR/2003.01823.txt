All three components of the current density are required to compute the heating rate due to free
magnetic energy dissipation. Here we present a first test of a new model developed to determine if
the times of increases in the resistive heating rate in active region (AR) photospheres are correlated
with the subsequent occurrence of M and X flares in the corona. A data driven, 3D, non-force-free
magnetohydrodynamic model restricted to the near-photospheric region is used to compute time series
of the complete current density and the resistive heating rate per unit volume [Q(t)] in each pixel in
neutral line regions (NLRs) of 14 ARs. The model is driven by time series of the magnetic field B
measured by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite.
Spurious Doppler periods due to SDO orbital motion are filtered out of the time series for B in every
AR pixel. For each AR, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of the NLR area
integral Qi(t) of Q(t) is found to be a scale invariant power law distribution essentially identical to
the observed CDF for the total energy released in coronal flares. This suggests that coronal flares and
the photospheric Qi are correlated, and powered by the same process. The model predicts spikes in
Qi with values orders of magnitude above background values. These spikes are driven by spikes in the
non-force free component of the current density. The times of these spikes are plausibly correlated with
times of subsequent M or X flares a few hours to a few days later. The spikes occur on granulation
scales, and may be signatures of heating in horizontal current sheets. It is also found that the times
of relatively large values of the rate of change of the NLR unsigned magnetic flux are also plausibly
correlated with the times of subsequent M and X flares, and spikes in Qi.

rent densities that represent free magnetic energy available
for conversion into particle energy during the flaring pro-
cess [1–6]. Coronal observations show that for M and X
flares, smaller pre-cursor flares occur in the same region
within (cid:24) 24 hours prior to the main flares [7], and that
there are temporal and spatial correlations between con-
secutive flares [8]. These facts suggest that, in the corona,
the NLR current system evolves towards a large flaring
event, and that this evolution involves smaller scale en-
ergy releases via current dissipation. Observations of quiet
Sun network magnetic fields in the transition region indi-
cate the appearance and intensification of non-potential
magnetic fields, and hence of current densities, and sug-
gest this can lead to network scale, magnetic reconnection
driven eruptive events similar to, though on a smaller scale
than coronal flares [9]. This process is observed to be cor-
related with photospheric magnetic flux emergence, and
might be causally connected with coronal flaring [9]. Sim-
ulations and observations indicate that forming ARs ex-
pand into the corona with net currents that concentrate
in NLRs [5, 10]. Collectively, these coronal and transition
region observations and simulations raise the questions
of whether there are corresponding current enhancements
and heating events in the photosphere, and whether they
are correlated with coronal flaring.

Observations of the complete photospheric current den-
sity J at sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolu-
tion and coverage can answer these questions. Computa-
tion of J = c∇ (cid:2) B/(4(cid:25)), where B is the magnetic field
and c is the speed of light, requires knowing the 3D field
B(x; y; z; t) at the photosphere, modeled here as a plane
surface using Cartesian coordinates (x; y; z), with z height
above the photosphere, and t the time. Accurate computa-
tion of J from observations of B is challenging because its
components are differences of derivatives of components of
B. This double differencing operation on components of
B amplifies measurement error in B.

There are models based on incomplete observations
of the photospheric B, such as those based on Michel-
son Doppler Imager (MDI, [11]) line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms, and Imaging Vector Magnetograph magne-
tograms (IVM, e.g., [12]) that suggest affirmative answers
to these questions, and show some effectiveness in predict-
1)
ing M and X flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
Examples of such models are those of Falconer et al. [13–
17], Schrijver [18], Korsós et al. [19–22], Georgoulis &
Rust [23] (also see [24]), and Leka & Barnes [25–27] and
Barnes & Leka [28] (also see [1, 29, 30]). A review of some
of these models, and of others, along with a compari-
son of their effectiveness in predicting flares is given by
Barnes et al. [31], in which it is concluded that the mod-
els considered do not perform substantially better than

1)MDI provides full disk measurements of the LOS photospheric
magnetic field with a spatial resolution of 4′′, and a full disk mag-
netogram temporal resolution of 90 minutes. IVM provides spatial
and temporal resolutions (cid:24) 0:55′′ (cid:0) 2′′ and 2–4 minutes.

climatological forecasts, which are based on long-term
averages.

It is claimed here that the predictions of the better per-
forming models are more directly based on estimates of
components of J , and that there is a positive correlation
between larger values of J and the occurrence of M and
X flares. Of the 11 flare prediction algorithms reviewed
and compared in Barnes et al. [31], none are found to
be clearly superior to others, and none are found to be
especially effective. However, the algorithms of Schrijver
[18] and Falconer et al. [13–17] are among the top per-
forming algorithms. It is claimed here that the reason for
this is that those algorithms come closest to directly com-
puting part of the current density, and using its mag-
nitude as a major component of the algorithm. Due to
the fact that observations do not provide the complete
photospheric B, none of these models compute the com-
plete photospheric J . The success of these models suggests
that greater success in forecasting flares may be achieved
by using models that: (i) Compute the complete J . (ii)
Are driven by higher resolution measurements of B that
cover entire ARs continuously in time. (iii) Do not con-
strain the model-derived B to be force-free, so that pho-
tospheric phenomena, such as NLR current sheet dynam-
ics, which involves non-zero Lorentz forces and heating by
currents ?B, can be extracted from the data through the
models.

1.1 An HMI data driven model that computes the

complete photospheric current density

A model of this type is presented here, along with ini-
tial results based on the analysis of time series of B from
14 ARs. The model is driven by the 2D photospheric
B(x; y; t) observed by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI, [32–34]) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) satellite. The model combines this data with the
∇ (cid:1) B = 0 condition to determine an analytic expression
for a 3D magnetic field B(x; y; z; t) that is valid suffi-
ciently close to the photosphere at z = 0. This allows
the model to predict the complete J at the photosphere.
HMI has the unique capability of combining full disk, con-
tinuous time observations of B with a spatial and tempo-
ral resolution of 1′′ and 12 minutes, which are sufficiently
fine to begin to resolve the dynamics of granules. Gran-
ules are the smallest convection cells in the photosphere.
They have diameters d (cid:24) 1000–2000 km, and flow speeds
v (cid:24) 2–7 km(cid:1)s(cid:0)1 [35]. Their lifetime is defined as the con-
vective turnover time (cid:28) (cid:24) d/v (cid:24) 2:4–16.7 minutes. Ob-
servations show that the photospheric magnetic field is
concentrated in inter-granular lanes, and magnetic flux
continually emerges into the photosphere in these regions,
with quiet Sun field strengths up to several hG in internet-
work, (cid:24) 103 G in network, and with the emergence first
appearing as a region of mixed polarity, nearly horizon-
tal magnetic flux [36–40]. The photospheric J (x; y; 0; t) is
obtained by analytically computing ∇ (cid:2) B(x; y; z; t), and

setting z = 0.
This gives an estimate of the complete,
full disk, photospheric J on granulation scales. The vector
potential A, and electric field E are also computed along
with the resistive heating rate per unit volume (Q) at the
photosphere. These quantities are used to compute J (cid:1) E
and v (cid:1) (J (cid:2) B)/c, where v is the center of mass (CM)
velocity, which are respectively the rate per unit volume
at which the electromagnetic (EM) energy and particle ki-
netic energy (KE) reservoirs exchange energy, and the rate
at which the EM energy and CM KE reservoirs exchange
energy.

The model and the computational algorithm that solves
it using HMI data were developed on a NASA Phase 1
SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) project (2014
3)
- henceforth and in the bibliography referenced as S14)
.
The algorithm computes quantities in every AR pixel. Be-
fore computing quantities that involve B, the spurious
Doppler periods in the HMI measured B due to SDO or-
bital motion, and concentrated at periods of 6, 12, and
24 hours, are filtered out of the time series of B for each
pixel using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based band
pass filter. Due to the time and funding constraints of S14,
it was only possible to develop and implement the com-
putational algorithm, and test it on 14 ARs using 3–4 day
long time series of the HMI measured B for each AR.

1.2 Summary of the main results

Define Qi(t) to be the NLR area integral of Q(x; y; 0; t).
The algorithm used to select the pixels that define the
NLR at each time for each AR is described in Section 2.3.
The main results presented in this paper are:

i) Spikes in Qi, appearing as increases by orders of mag-
nitude above background values are found to occur
in the NLRs of the 14 ARs. The largest spikes oc-
cur in the time series of Qi for ARs that have M
or X flares, and their times of occurrence suggest it
is plausible they are correlated with the occurrence
of M or X flares a few hours to a few days later.
A subset of these spikes was analyzed at the pixel
level, and found to occur on the HMI and granulation
scales of 1 arcsec and 12 minutes. Spikes are found in
ARs with and without M or X flares, and outside as
well as inside NLRs, but the largest spikes are local-
ized in the NLRs of ARs with M or X flares, and
associated with horizontal magnetic field strengths
(cid:24) several hG, and vertical magnetic field strengths
several orders of magnitude smaller. The large spikes
in Qi are due to non-force-free currents J? (?B),
and convection driven heating, which converts CM
kinetic energy into thermal energy. At all times, and
especially in strongly flaring ARs, resistive heating

2)In the model, it is only at z = 0 that the ∇ (cid:1) B = 0 condition is

satisfied exactly. See Section 2.2.

(/ J 2) tends to be dominated by J? by orders of
magnitude. These results suggest the large spikes are
associated with horizontal, granulation scale current
sheets. These results are discussed in Sections 5 and
6.

ii) Let (cid:8)i(t) be the NLR area integral of the signed mag-
netic flux through the photosphere. The times of oc-
currence of the larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj are plausibly
correlated with the times of subsequent large spikes
in Qi, and M and X flares. A similar analysis of the
time series of the unsigned magnetic flux, the mag-
nitude of the signed magnetic flux, and the magnetic
energy density does not suggest such correlations be-
tween their behavior and the occurrence of M or X
flares, or spikes in Qi. These results are discussed in
Section 5.

iii) The model computed cumulative distribution func-
tion (CDF) of Qi for each of the 14 ARs is found
to be essentially identical to the observed CDF of
the energy E of coronal flares. The CDF of Qi is the
number N (Qi) of NLR area integrated heating rates
with values (cid:21) Qi. Above an AR dependent value of
Qi, N (Qi) is found to be a scale invariant power law
distribution, meaning N (Qi) = kQ(cid:0)s
i with k an AR
dependent number independent of Qi, and s indepen-
dent of Qi and the same for all ARs to within about
1 standard deviation. The observed CDF N (E) for
coronal flares is N (E) = KE(cid:0)S where K is an AR
dependent number independent of E, and S is in-
dependent of E, and shows little statistical variation
between ARs. It is found that the observed range of S
and the model computed range of s are essentially the
same. This similarity between N (Qi) and N (E) sug-
gests a connection between whatever process drives
the photospheric Qi, and the one that drives coronal
flares. These results are discussed in Section 7.

2 The model

The model is a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that
uses all of the available HMI B data for a given AR. The
model is valid close to the photosphere, meaning that the
analytical, semi-empirically determined expression for B
is valid through order z2, and the ∇ (cid:1) B = 0 condition
is satisfied through order z, as discussed in Section 2.2.
Once all derivatives with respect to z are computed for
quantities of interest, such as J , the limit z ! 0 is taken to
obtain the final set of photospheric time series. In this way,
the 3D nature of the model differs from that of the many
types of models that extrapolate the magnetic field from
the photosphere into the corona (e.g., [41] and references
therein).

The only differential equation in the model is for A.
This equation is solved analytically. E is determined
from A. There are no equations for density, tempera-

ture, pressure, or momentum. A data determined length
scale L(x; y; t) determines the derivatives of all compo-
nents of B with respect to z at the photosphere, allowing
the complete J (x; y; 0; t) to be computed. It is enforcing
the ∇ (cid:1) B = 0 condition that allows L(x; y; t), and hence
J (x; y; 0; t) to be computed.

The HMI pixel side length is 0:5′′, with pixel overlap
resulting in a magnetic field resolution (cid:24) 1′′((cid:24) 725 km).
The HMI data pipeline provides time averaged data with
a resolution of 12 minutes. Data with higher time resolu-
tion is available. The 12 minute averaged data from the
hmi.sharp_720s_cea data series are used here to minimize
effects of noise. Every 12 minutes HMI provides a full disk
map of B. HMI B is a function of x; y, and t. The use of
the cea (cylindrical equal area) data helps minimize pro-
jection error, including correcting for the effect of solar
differential rotation [34, 42].

The use of Cartesian coordinates and Cartesian mag-
netic field components in the model introduces projec-
tion error in the following sense. The hmi.sharp_720s_cea
data series used here provides the magnetic field in spher-
ical components (Br; B(cid:18); Bϕ) as a function of spherical
coordinates ((cid:18); ϕ) at the photosphere. Bϕ is positive west-
ward in the direction of solar rotation, B(cid:18) is positive in
the southward direction, and Br is positive upward from
the photosphere. Here we set Bx = Bϕ, By = B(cid:18), and
Bz = Br, with the x; y directions chosen correspondingly.
Therefore a transformation between spherical and Carte-
sian coordinates and vector components that accounts for
the finite radius of curvature of the Sun is not used. The
resulting error is projection error. The following estimates
show this error is not expected to be large for ARs that are
not too close to the limb where it is difficult to make ac-
curate measurements. The maximum error is (cid:24) the ratio
of the characteristic dimension of an AR ((cid:24) 7 (cid:2) 104 km)
to the solar radius Rs. This ratio is (cid:24) 0:1. The error is ex-
pected to be smaller for our analysis since it is restricted
to NLRs, which have areas smaller than those of their cor-
responding ARs. Pixel scale computations, such as of J ,
have a much smaller error, on the order of 1′′/Rs (cid:24) 10(cid:0)3
for HMI. In order to partially reduce projection error, the
time series used here are chosen so the corresponding ARs
stay within (cid:24) 60◦ of disc center during the duration of the
time series.

2.1 The model magnetic field

The temporal and horizontal spatial variation of the pho-
tospheric magnetic field B is known down to the resolu-
tion of HMI. The HMI measurements are compromised
by spurious Doppler oscillations, which we filter out of
the data before using it to determine the model magnetic
field. HMI does not provide information about the vertical
dependence of B. Since the horizontal J involves @Bx/@z
and @By/@z, it is necessary to know this dependence near
the photosphere in order to determine the complete J at
the photosphere. The model field is constructed to repro-

duce the HMI time series of B in each pixel in each AR,
and to have a space and time dependent vertical varia-
tion at the photosphere determined by requiring that the
∇ (cid:1) B = 0 constraint be satisfied exactly at the photo-
sphere. The model field is not constrained to be force-free.
These are natural requirements on the model field, but
there are many ways to construct such a field. We choose
a relatively simple form for this field, but do not claim it
is an accurate representation of the actual photospheric
field. Our objective is to find a way to improve flare pre-
diction. The degree to which our choice of the model field
is justified is the degree to which results derived from it
improve flare prediction.

Let Lx and Ly be the x and y dimensions of the rectan-
gular region used to enclose most or all of the AR modeled.
The HMI pixel side length ∆ = 0:5′′. The number of HMI
data points covering this region is N = (Nx + 1)(Ny + 1),
where Nx = Lx/∆, Ny = Ly/∆, and Nx and Ny are given
by the HMI datasets. For any function f (x; y; z; t), define
f;x = @f /@x, and similarly for derivatives with respect to
y; z, and t.

Here the bnm(t) are complex, and L(x; y; t) (cid:17) L0(x; y; t)+
zL1(x; y; t)/L0 where L0 and L1 are real and determined
by the HMI data and the ∇(cid:1)B = 0 condition, as described
in Section 2.2. Equation (1) is assumed to be valid for
sufficiently small z.

Equation (1) is chosen as the representation of B for the
following reasons: (i) As discussed below, at z = 0 the 2D
Fourier expansion of B(x; y; 0) allows the expansion coef-
ficients to be determined rapidly using a FFT that uses all
of the HMI data in each AR. The resulting B(x; y; 0) ex-
actly reproduces the HMI measured field in each pixel. (ii)
The data determines the space and time dependence of L,
and so directly determines @B/@z, and hence Jx and Jy.
(iii) The separable, exponential form of the z dependence
is chosen for simplicity. It allows @B/@z to be exactly
computed analytically, as opposed to requiring numerical
computation. Any determination of B is approximate,
and the degree to which its mathematical representation
is justified is determined by how useful it proves to be in
understanding the solar atmosphere. Equation (1) appears
to be a new representation of B at the photosphere. The
results in this paper suggest it is useful.

For z = 0, and given the N vectors B(xi; yi; 0; tj) from
the HMI data for each j, Eq. (1) represents N complex,
linear, inhomogeneous equations for the N complex un-
knowns for each of the three components of bnm(t). There
are a total of 3N equations to solve at each time. The
time series of the bnm(t) are determined using an FFT
algorithm to solve these equations. The imaginary part of
B must be zero, which is used as a check on the numerical

solution for the bnm(t). Since B must be real, it is compu-

This is done as follows.

As discussed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4, J and A are
determined analytically from B, and E is determined by
numerical time differentiation of A. Since the magnetic
field model reproduces the HMI determined field, errors
in J ; A, and E are due to inaccuracies in the data, which
include limited time and space resolution, and due to
any deviation of the actual height dependence of B at
the photosphere from the assumed exponential
factor
exp((cid:0)z/L(x; y; t)) where z ! 0, and L is determined
by the HMI data as discussed in Section 2.2. Because J
involves differences of derivatives of components of B, it
is especially sensitive to measurement and model error.
The magnetic field model is largely chosen on the basis
of information available from observations of the field,
which, relative to resolving the horizontal variation of B,
are severely lacking in resolution of the height dependence

The right hand sides of Eqs. (5) and (6) are evaluated at
z = 0. Therefore, L0 and L1 are completely determined
by the HMI data. The resulting expression for B is valid
through order z2. It is the ∇ (cid:1) B = 0 condition plus the
HMI data that determine the z dependence of B, which
is what allows the complete expressions for Jx and Jy to
be computed. Without a determination of the height de-
pendence of B, the components of Jx and Jy that involve
By;z and Bx;z at z = 0 cannot be computed.

orders of magnitude above background values, with the
largest spikes occurring in the NLRs of strongly flaring
(SF) ARs. Here an SF AR is defined as one with M or X
flares, and a control AR (C AR) is defined as one with
lower class or no flares.

The NLR for each AR at each time is determined in the
following way. Schrijver [18] used MDI magnetograms to
identify 3 (cid:2) 3 pixel blocks that contain one or more pairs
of opposite polarity LOS magnetic fields with magnitudes
> 150 G. The set of such blocks contains the highest gra-
dient polarity separation lines, which define the regions
of highest current density. Each region is convolved with
an appropriately centered Gaussian with a FWHM of 15

Mm centered on the region. The resulting set of pixels is
defined to be the NLR. This NLR mapping algorithm was
modified and implemented for HMI data by Bobra [43].
This modified algorithm is used here to define the NLR.
The set of pixels that define the NLR varies with time,
may comprise disjoint regions, and is re-computed by the
model at each 12 minute time step. The NLRs analyzed
here are comprised of (cid:24) 103–104 pixels.

The ai(0 (cid:20) i (cid:20) 3) are obtained by solving A = ∇ (cid:2) B
together with the Coulomb gauge condition ∇ (cid:1) A = 0,
order by order in powers of z, for specified boundary con-
ditions on the ai. The question is how to choose these
boundary conditions. There is no guidance from observa-
tions for how to make this choice. Consequently, the choice
is made heuristically as follows.

The electric field may always be written as
E = (cid:0) 1
c

@A
@t

(cid:0) ∇(cid:8);

(12)

for some scalar function (cid:8). The electric and magnetic
fields are gauge independent [44]. The Coulomb gauge is
the appropriate gauge to use for computing E in cases
in which E is primarily an induction field, generated by
@B/@t, as opposed to an electrostatic field, generated
by charge separation. The reason is that in the Coulomb
gauge (cid:8) is the electrostatic potential, so (cid:0)∇(cid:8) is the elec-
trostatic field, in which case this term may be neglected

in Eq. (12). This simplification is used here based on
the assumption that the electrostatic field may be ne-
glected in comparison with the induction electric field
on the photospheric space and time scales of interest
here, which are respectively ≫ the Debye length, and

assumption is consistent with MHD because the quasi-
neutrality approximation of MHD is by definition valid on
these space and time scales. Then, in the Coulomb gauge,
E (cid:24) (cid:0)c(cid:0)1@A/@t.

It follows that boundary conditions on E can to some
extent be used to determine boundary conditions on A.
Assume that Ez(x; y; 0; t) = (@Ez(x; y; z; t)/@z)z=0 = 0
for all t. Consistent with this assumption, the choice a0z =
a1z = 0 for all t is made. A heuristic justification for the
assumed boundary conditions on Ez is as follows. Treating
the photosphere as a perfectly conducting surface implies
Ez = 4(cid:25)(cid:27), and Ex = Ey = 0 at z = 0, where (cid:27) is the
surface charge density. Assuming (cid:27) = 0, and ∇ (cid:1) E =
4(cid:25)(cid:26)c = 0, where (cid:26)c is the volume charge density, gives the
assumed boundary conditions.

With these boundary conditions A is uniquely deter-
mined. Let (cid:6)′ denote the sum over all n and m except the

2.5 Ohm’s law

The assumed Ohm’s law for the photosphere is

E +

v (cid:2) B
c

= (cid:17)J :

(16)

Here (cid:17) is the parallel (Spitzer) resistivity, assumed con-
stant with the value 2 (cid:2) 10(cid:0)12 s (Fig. 3 of Ref. [45])
. E
and J can be computed once B is determined from the
model.

5)

4)The relevant Debye length and collision times are (cid:24) 10(cid:0)5 cm and
10(cid:0)10–10(cid:0)9 s. These are insignificant compared with the HMI
spatial and temporal resolutions of 1′′ and 12 minutes.

5)This value of (cid:17) corresponds to a temperature T (cid:24) 6000 K, and
includes the effects of electron collisions with protons, HI, and HeI.
See Ref. [45] for a detailed derivation of the conductivity tensor
for a 3-particle species representation of the solar atmosphere that
includes contributions from electrons, protons, HI, HeI, and singly
charged ions other than protons.

Independent of the form of the Ohm’s law, the rate
J (cid:1)E at which EM energy is converted into particle energy
may be decomposed as J (cid:1) E = Q + RCM . Here Q (cid:17)
J (cid:1) (E + (v (cid:2) B)/c) is the Joule heating rate per unit
volume, and RCM (cid:17) v (cid:1) (J (cid:2) B)/c is the rate at which
EM energy is converted into CM KE. For the Ohm’s law
used here, Q = (cid:17)J 2, and RCM is computed as J (cid:1) E (cid:0) Q.
Although the Ohm’s gives v? = c[(E (cid:0) (cid:17)J ) (cid:2) B]/B2, v?
is not used in this paper.

If jJ (cid:1) Ej ≪ Q then Q (cid:24) (cid:0)RCM . This is the case of
convection driven heating, for which there is essentially
no change in the EM energy of the plasma, and CM KE
is transformed directly into thermal energy. In this case,
the electric field that drives the heating is the convection
electric field Econv = (v (cid:2) B)/c. Noting that J (cid:1) E =
Q (cid:0) J (cid:1) Econv, the case of convection driven heating may
be defined by the condition Q (cid:24) J (cid:1) Econv. The convection
electric field drives a current density J? perpendicular to
B. As shown in Sections 5 and 6, the largest values of Qi,
which correspond to the strongest current enhancements,
are almost entirely convection driven, while most smaller

34601-6

Michael L. Goodman, et al., Front. Phys. 15(3), 34601 (2020)

Research article

values of Qi are not convection driven. Consistent with
this result, it is shown that the larger values of Qi are due
to increases in J? by orders of magnitude, while there is
relatively little or no change in J//, which is the magnitude
of the current density parallel to B.

Define RCM i as the NLR area integral of RCM . It fol-
lows from J (cid:1) E = Q + RCM that (J (cid:1) E)i = Qi + RCM i.
This relation is used to compute RCM i in Section 5 and 6
to show that the largest spikes in Qi are convection driven.

3 Removal of spurious Doppler periods from

the HMI BBB data

Due to the orbital motion of SDO, there are spurious,
Doppler shift generated oscillations in the HMI data for
the components of B in each pixel [33, 34, 46–49]. The fun-
damental oscillation period is 24 hours, but associated os-
cillations at 6 and 12 hours are observed, and other related
spurious periods may also be present, although their val-
ues and ranges are not clearly known. The oscillation am-
plitudes can be as large as 100 G, with the largest ampli-
tudes concentrated in strong field regions (i.e., B > 1000
G). Consequently, the resulting error in quantities that
are sums over pixels of quantities derived from the mag-
netic field increases with the number of pixels, and can
be very large. Since NLR integrated quantities typically
involve sums over from 103 to several times 104 pixels,
we decided to remove this Doppler noise by applying an
FFT based band-pass filter to the time series of HMI B
for each pixel. The filter removes all components of the
magnetic field signal with periods (cid:21) 5:56 hours, but re-
tains the DC component. This means our analysis is based
on the high frequency component of B, meaning that only
periods < 5:56 hours are retained in the signal, in addition
to the DC component. The filtering probably eliminates
all or almost all of the Doppler noise. But it also removes
any real AR magnetic field dynamics with periods in this
range. The HMI time series analyzed here have lengths of
70–140 hours, and AR magnetic fields typically undergo
large changes on these time scales. The filter eliminates
a large source of error due to the spurious Doppler peri-
ods, but may also remove multiple, real oscillations in B
at periods (cid:21) 5:56 hours that occur during the duration
of the time series. However, this elimination of part of
the real magnetic field signal is not by itself a problem
because the important question is whether the remain-
ing high frequency component of B, or quantities derived
from it, prove useful for flare prediction. Based on re-
sults presented in Section 5, we claim it is plausible that
the derived Qi and jd(cid:8)i/dtj are useful in this way, but a
definitive statistical test of their usefulness must be based
on an analysis of at least hundreds more HMI AR time
series of B. Henceforth it is understood that all magnetic
field based quantities are high frequency quantities, mean-
ing that they are derived from the high frequency B just

defined. In Section 5.2 it is shown there is a plausible corre-
lation between larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj, spikes in Qi, and
M and X flares. Larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj correspond to
larger values of j@B/@tj, which correspond to the higher
frequency component of B. This suggests that filtering
out the lower frequency component of B, as is done here,
retains the dynamics of B most important for flare pre-
diction.

Examples of the effect of the filter are as follows. Denote
the filtered and un-filtered time series for Bx as Bxf and
Bxu, and similarly for other quantities. Figure 1 shows
the filtered HMI time series of the components of B, the
difference between the un-filtered and filtered time series,
and the magnitude of their ratio for a randomly selected
pixel from the NLR of NOAA AR 1166 during a 70 hour
long time series. This AR is one of the SF ARs analyzed
here. The figure shows that the difference between the
filtered and un-filtered time series is as large as 50 G.
These differences are consistent with observations of the
Doppler noise (see references at the beginning of this sec-
tion). Similar differences are found for time series of B in
other pixels that have maximum unfiltered field strengths
up to a few hundred G. For pixels with larger unfiltered
field strengths the differences tend to increase with field
strength, reaching RMS values up to (cid:24) 102 G. We be-
lieve these larger differences are due to the filtering out of
some of the real AR dynamics with periods (cid:21) 5:56 hours,
in addition to the Doppler noise.

As stated, the differences between filtered and unfiltered
quantities that are integrals of pixel level quantities over
NLRs can be large. For example, again consider the time
series for NOAA AR 1166 used for Fig. 1. Figures 2–3
show the results of integrating the filtered and un-filtered
pixel level results for (cid:17)J 2 and B2/8(cid:25) over the NLR at
each time. The 70 hour long time interval includes 1 X, 2
M, and 9 C flares. For these and subsequent figures, the
red, green, and light blue vertical lines and their labels
indicate the times and magnitudes of X, M, and C flares.
During the 70 hour long time series the number of pixels
in the NLR varies across the range of (cid:24) 3 (cid:2) 104 (cid:0) 6 (cid:2) 104.
The figures show large differences between the filtered and
unfiltered quantities.

4 Fluctuations in BBB and measurement error

There are three basic processes that can appear as random
fluctuations in B.

One is random fluctuations in the HMI measurement
system. Their mean values are (cid:24) 100 G for B, with the
noise in LOS B (cid:24) 10 times smaller than in transverse B
[34, 50]. For the Cartesian representation used here, this
approximately translates into mean noise levels (cid:24) 9:95 G
in Bz, and (cid:24) 70:4 G in each of Bx and By. Larger random
fluctuations in B, up to (cid:24) 220 G, mainly in transverse B,
are possible [33].

A second process is the random fluctuations in photo-
spheric dynamics. This is part of the real dynamics of
B. The amplitude of these fluctuations is not accurately
known. Here this amplitude is estimated using the ob-
served approximate validity of the equi-partition condi-
tion B = (4(cid:25)(cid:26))1/2v, valid mainly for horizontal fields, but

accurate to within a factor (cid:24) 2 for stronger vertical fields
[51]. Assume a constant background state with density
(cid:26)0, velocity v0, and magnetic field B0, and random per-
turbations (cid:26)1; v1, and B1. The equi-partition assumption
implies (B0 + B1)2/(8(cid:25)) = ((cid:26)0 + (cid:26)1)(v0 + v1)2/2. Taking
the time average ⟨ ⟩ of this expression gives B2

time scale of granular dynamics, the photospheric plasma
is incompressible, which here means that (cid:26) (cid:24) (cid:26)0. This is
a reasonable approximation if photospheric dynamics is
driven mainly by convective forces rather than by mag-
netic forces. This is the case if two related conditions are

satisfied: (i) The first condition is that the plasma (cid:12) ≫ 1,
where (cid:12) (cid:17) 8(cid:25)p/B2 = (4/3)(Vs/VA)2. Here p; Vs, and VA
are the pressure, and sound and Alfvén speeds defined by
Vs = [3kBT /(2mp)]1/2 and VA = B/(4(cid:25)(cid:26))1/2, assuming
the ideal gas equation of state p = (cid:26)kBT /mp for a neutral
H plasma, where kB and mp are Boltzmann’s constant

g(cid:1)cm(cid:0)3, and B = 500 G gives Vs (cid:24) 9 km(cid:1)s(cid:0)1, VA (cid:24) 2:5
km(cid:1)s(cid:0)1, and (cid:12) (cid:24) 17:3. Even for field strengths (cid:24) 103 G,
(cid:12) (cid:24) 4:3. It follows that photospheric dynamics is domi-
nated by the hydrodynamics of convection, so the speed of
acoustic waves determines how rapidly local density fluc-
tuations are damped out by wave spreading. (ii) Given
this, the second condition is that Vs be sufficiently large
so that the time it takes an acoustic wave to cross a gran-
ulation diameter (cid:24) 103 km is less than the characteristic
granulation lifetime (cid:28) (cid:24) 2:4–16:7 minutes (Section 1.1).
This crossing time is 103 km/Vs (cid:24) 1:85 minutes, which is
< (cid:28) . From (i) and (ii) it follows that the effects of (cid:26)1 can be
ignored to first order when estimating the fluctuation am-
plitude B1 within the equi-partition approximation. Then
⟩1/2 = 2–7 km(cid:1)s(cid:0)1,
B1 (cid:24) (4(cid:25)(cid:26)0)1/2⟨v2

which is the approximate range of granule flow speeds [35]
gives B1 (cid:24) 400–1400 G, which is (cid:24) 4–14(1:8–6:4) times
larger than the mean(maximum) HMI measurement noise
amplitudes for B. These rough estimates suggest that the
random component of B driven by photospheric dynamics
is significantly larger than the HMI measurement error.

The third process is the chaotic component of photo-
spheric dynamics. This is a deterministic component of
the dynamics, but usually difficult or impossible to detect
in complex, spatially extended systems such as the pho-
tosphere due to insufficient resolution, and consequently
is often indistinguishable from a random process. This is
discussed more in Section 7. Any fluctuations in B due to
photospheric chaos is part of the real dynamics of B.

The conclusion is that photospheric dynamics domi-
nates HMI measurement error in determining the mea-
sured B.

In addition, regions of higher B have a higher signal to
noise ratio (SNR). NLRs tend to be the regions of high-
est B, and, as discussed in Section 2.3, Schrijver’s algo-
rithm [18] constructs NLRs based on selecting 3 (cid:2) 3 pixel
blocks containing one or more pairs of opposite polarity
LOS magnetic fields with magnitudes (cid:21) 150 G, tending
to maximize the SNR.

5 Heating spikes and signed magnetic (cid:13)ux in

strongly (cid:13)aring ARs

Let (cid:8)i be the signed magnetic flux through the photo-
sphere. It is computed as the integral of Bz over the area
of the NLR. Figure 4 and the upper left plot in Fig. 5 show
the time series of Qi, and of the indicated time averages
of (cid:8)i for the 7 SF ARs.

5.1 A plausible correlation between spikes in Qi, and M

and X flares

The times of the largest spikes in Qi relative to the times
of M and X flares in these plots indicate it is plausible

Research article

that these spikes are correlated with the subsequent oc-
currence of these flares, and indicate the need to analyze
time series of Qi for more ARs to statistically determine
if such a correlation exists. The plausibility of a correla-
tion is suggested by the following trends shown for each
AR.

AR 1158: The largest spike in Qi by a factor (cid:24) 25
occurs (cid:24) 38–68 hours before the first X and M flares, and
before the start of the flaring sequence.

AR 1166: The largest spike is (cid:24) 3:5 orders of magnitude
larger than all others, and occurs 26 hours before the X
flare. The next 2 largest spikes occur (cid:24) 38–44 hours before
the X flare. All of these spikes occur before the start of
the flaring sequence.

AR 1261: The 6 largest spikes occur (cid:24) 18–39 hours
before the M flare, and all but one are more than an order
of magnitude larger than the 7th largest spike. The second
largest spike, which is close in magnitude to the largest,
occurs before the start of the flaring sequence.

AR 1283: The 3 largest spikes occur (cid:24) 22–25 hours
before the first X flare, and occur before the start of
the flaring sequence. The 2 largest of these are more
than an order of magnitude larger than the 4th largest
spike.

Coupled ARs 1429 and 1430: These ARs are magneti-
cally coupled in the sense that they are merging during the
time series. The 9 largest spikes occur about one day be-
fore the two X flares near t=0, but after the X1.1 flare. The
meaning of the timing of these spikes for ARs 1429/1430,
and for AR 1890 is complicated by the fact that the largest
spikes occur between X flares.

AR 1890: For values above background values, which
are ≲ 1023 ergs(cid:1)s(cid:0)1(cid:1)cm(cid:0)1, Qi increases from the left to-
wards the first X1.1 flare, attains its largest value between
the two X1.1 flares, and tends to decrease after the second
X1.1 flare.

AR 2017: The largest spike by an order of magnitude
occurs (cid:24) 4 hours before the X flare. The next 3 largest
spikes occur before the start of the flaring sequence, and
(cid:24) 90–105 hours before the X flare.

For the 5 ARs with heating rate time series that begin
before the start of the flaring sequence, the largest spike
and/or some of the other large spikes occur before the
start of the flaring sequence.

5.2 A plausible correlation between jd(cid:8)i/dtj, spikes in

Qi, and M and X flares

In Figs. 4 and 5 the time series of (cid:8)i are averaged using
the Matlab moving window function “smooth”. Two win-
dows are chosen for the averaging to better reveal trends
on relatively short and long time scales. The time series
of (cid:8)i for the SF ARs suggest the most rapid and pro-
longed increases or decreases in (cid:8)i are correlated with the
larger subsequent increases in Qi within a few hours. A
correlation between longer time scale and rapid changes

in (cid:8)i, and the occurrence of subsequent M or X flares
is also suggested by the following trends shown for each
AR.

AR 1158: The first M flare occurs about 6 hours after
the end of the interval t = [(cid:0)55:6; (cid:0)36:4] over which (cid:8)i
decreases. The second M flare occurs about 6 hours after

the end of the interval t = [(cid:0)25:4; (cid:0)14:8] over which (cid:8)i
decreases. The first X flare occurs near the end of the
interval t = [(cid:0)7:4; 2] over which (cid:8)i decreases. The third M
flare, along with a C flare occurs at the end of the interval
t = [2; 23:6] over which (cid:8)i increases. (cid:8)i then decreases to
the end of the time series, with an M flare and a cluster of

C flares occurring during this interval. The initial interval
from the beginning of the time series to t = (cid:0)55:6, over
which (cid:8)i increases by a large amount does not contain any
flares, but does contain the value of Qi that is the largest
by a factor of 40.

AR 1166: The X flare and the near simultaneous

C9.4 flare occur at the end of the 15 hour interval t =
[(cid:0)45; (cid:0)30], during which (cid:8)i decreases. This is followed by
the 28 hour interval t = [(cid:0)30; (cid:0)2] during which (cid:8)i in-
creases, with the two M flares occurring in the middle of
this interval after a large amplitude oscillation in (cid:8)i in the
interval t = [(cid:0)20; (cid:0)16]. The C7.7 flare at t = (cid:0)24, and

the largest value of Qi, at t = (cid:0)27, occur immediately
after a period of rapid decrease and increase in (cid:8)i over
the interval t = [(cid:0)35; (cid:0)27].

AR 1261: The M flare at t=0 occurs after a rapid in-
crease and then decrease in (cid:8)i during the interval t =
[(cid:0)18; (cid:0)8]. It is less clear if the rapid decrease in (cid:8)i in the
interval t = [(cid:0)35; (cid:0)30], which appears to be associated
with at least the first two of the 5 largest values of Qi, is
also associated with the M flare.

AR 1283: The first M flare occurs soon after two rapid
oscillations in (cid:8)i, and occurs immediately after the cluster
of the 3 largest values of Qi, and after 3 other relatively
large values of Qi. The first X flare follows a rapid increase
and decrease in (cid:8)i over the interval t = [(cid:0)31; (cid:0)25]. After
the first X flare there is an overall increase in (cid:8)i, beginning
with a sharp increase around t = (cid:0)20. There are 3 sharp,
large amplitude oscillations in (cid:8)i ending (cid:24) 3 hours before
the second X flare. (cid:8)i continues to increase to the end
of the time series, with the second M flare occurring (cid:24) 8
hours later.

Coupled ARs 1429 and 1430: The time series begins
just after the first X flare so there are no prior val-
ues of Qi or (cid:8)i that may be correlated with it. The
3 consecutive time intervals defined by the times t =
[(cid:0)31:2; (cid:0)26:8; (cid:0)24:2; (cid:0)20:2] show an overall increase, de-
crease, and increase, respectively, in (cid:8)i with large slopes,
and these intervals contain 3, 1, and 2 M flares. There
is then an overall decrease in (cid:8)i up to t (cid:24) (cid:0)10, with
2 M flares occurring during this interval. After a brief,
sharp increase in (cid:8)i, there is a sharp, large decrease in (cid:8)i
up to the time of the two X flares near t = 0, followed
by a sharp, large amplitude increase. The 3 largest val-
ues of Qi occur near the end of intervals during which (cid:8)i
increases.

AR 1890: The first M flare follows a sharp increase in (cid:8)i
in the interval t = [(cid:0)77; (cid:0)74]. The second M flare follows
a sharp decrease in (cid:8)i in the interval t = [(cid:0)67:8; (cid:0)64:6].
The first X flare at t (cid:24) (cid:0)49 immediately follows a sharp
decrease in (cid:8)i beginning at t (cid:24) (cid:0)53:2. The second X flare
occurs at the end of the interval t = [(cid:0)11:6; 0] during
which (cid:8)i rapidly increases and then decreases. There are
other time intervals over which (cid:8)i rapidly increases or
decreases, and these are often soon followed by large spikes
in Qi or large C flares, or clusters of C flares.

AR 2017: There is a sharp decrease and then increase
in (cid:8)i over the interval t = [(cid:0)50; (cid:0)30], which ends at the
beginning of the flaring sequence, and (cid:24) 10 hours before
the first two M flares. The 4 hour average of (cid:8)i then re-
mains fairly constant until it drops sharply over the inter-
val t = [(cid:0)9; (cid:0)1], just before the X flare. This is followed
by a sharp increase and decrease in (cid:8)i just before the sub-
sequent M flare and a cluster of 6 of the largest values of
Qi. (cid:8)i continues to decrease after this M flare to the end
of the time series, with the largest C flare occurring (cid:24) 10
hours after the M flare.

A correlation between larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj, and sub-

H

sequent M/X flares and large spikes in Qi is suggested
by the following implications of Faraday’s law of induc-
tion, @B/@t = (cid:0)c∇ (cid:2) E. Let ϕ be the signed magnetic
flux through a photospheric area A bounded by the closed
curve C. Faraday’s law implies dϕ(t)/dt = (cid:0)c
C E (cid:1) dl,
showing that the changing flux generates an induction
electric field proportional to dϕ/dt. Next, taking the curl
of Faraday’s law, and neglecting the term containing the
net charge density, consistent with the quasi-neutrality
condition, gives @J /@t = [c2/(4(cid:25))]∇2E, showing that a
sufficiently inhomogeneous E drives changes in the cur-
rent density, increasing (decreasing) the kinetic energy of
particles if J (cid:1) E > (<)0. In order for a flare to occur,
J (cid:1) E must be > 0 over some volume and time interval
in order that magnetic energy be converted into particle
energy to drive the flare. These two equations for dϕ/dt
and @J /@t may be viewed as applying to each pixel in an
NLR. They are applied to an entire NLR by integrating
them over the area of the NLR. Let N (t) be the num-
ber of pixels in an NLR. Performing this integration on
the first equation gives d(cid:8)i/dt = (cid:0)c(cid:6)N (t)

work that would be done by E in moving a unit charge
around each of the Cjs, V (t) is a measure of the mag-
netic energy that E can potentially transfer to particles
in the NLR at time t, so this equation shows a direct con-
nection between d(cid:8)i/dt and the instantaneous magnetic
energy available for conversion into particle energy at the

occurs in this sum if some of the Vk have opposite signs. The NLRs

suggest a stronger correlation with flares and spikes in Qi than the
magnitude of the sum of the Vk, which is jV (t)j(= c(cid:0)1jd(cid:8)i/dtj).

tude of the NLR integrated signed magnetic flux, denoted

because, in contrast to the signed magnetic flux (cid:8)i, they
exclude negative values, and so do not provide as accu-

5.3 The lack of correlation between photospheric

magnetic energy and spikes in Qi, and M and X flares

Analysis of active region magnetograms generated from
Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) data shows a lack of cor-
relation between photospheric magnetic energy and coro-
nal flares (e.g., [15]). Consistent with this finding, and as
discussed in more detail in the following paragraph, there
is no correlation between photospheric magnetic energy
and spikes in Qi, or M and X flares for the ARs analyzed
here. Three possible reasons for this lack of correlation are
given.

Time series of the NLR area integral of the magnetic en-
ergy density, denoted (B2/(8(cid:25)))i, were also plotted along
with Qi and flare times. The plots are not included here.
For some SF ARs they show some combination of a grad-
ual increase, or relatively large spikes in (B2/(8(cid:25)))i be-
fore the beginning of a flaring sequence, or before M or
X flares during a flaring sequence. For the other SF ARs,
such a correlation between (B2/(8(cid:25)))i, Qi, and flare times
is much less apparent, and this is more the case for the
C ARs. Therefore (B2/(8(cid:25)))i is much less plausibly corre-
lated than jd(cid:8)i/dtj with the larger spikes in Qi, and M and
X flares. Three possible reasons for the lack of such a cor-
relation are the following. First, (B2/(8(cid:25)))i includes po-
tential and non-potential magnetic energy, and so might
not be an accurate measure of the non-potential energy,
which is the free magnetic energy available for conversion
into particle energy. Second, (B2/(8(cid:25)))i is a photospheric
quantity, and so might not provide any information about
the magnetic energy in the corona, where the flaring pro-
cess is believed to occur. The third reason is based on the
time evolution equation for B2/(8(cid:25)), which is Poynting’s
theorem, given by (8(cid:25))(cid:0)1@B2/@t = (cid:0)∇ (cid:1) S (cid:0) J (cid:1) E, where
S is the Poynting flux. Integrating this over an NLR gives
∇ (cid:1) SdA (cid:0) (Qi + RCM i). As dis-
d(B2/8(cid:25))i/dt = (cid:0)
cussed in Section 5.4, the largest spikes in Qi are found
to be driven by the conversion of CM KE into thermal
energy, rather than by the conversion of magnetic energy
into thermal energy, meaning that Qi (cid:24) (cid:0)RCM i during

a large spike. In that case it follows from Poynting’s the-
orem that during a large spike any change in (B2/(8(cid:25)))i
is mainly due to the Poynting flux term, and so does not
have a significant correlation with Qi.

5.4 The large spikes in Qi are due to non-force-free

currents and convection driven heating

Figures 5 and 6 show the time series of RCM i for the 7 SF
ARs. The plots include the values of Qi and (J (cid:1) E)i when
Qi exceeds a threshold for each time series. Each threshold
is the approximate value below which most values of Qi
occur, and above which the relatively few large spikes oc-
cur. The time series show that for values of Qi above the
threshold, which is similar ((cid:24) 1021–1022 ergs(cid:1)s(cid:0)1(cid:1)cm(cid:0)1)
for all 7 time series, Qi is very close to (cid:0)RCM i. As dis-
cussed in Section 2.5, this is the case of convection driven
heating: the largest heating events, corresponding to the
largest current spikes, are due to the conversion of bulk
flow kinetic energy into thermal energy, rather than due
to the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy.
If convection driven heating occurs in this way, it does
not exclude the possibility that these heating events are
reconnection driven, with magnetic energy initially con-
verted into bulk flow kinetic energy in the form of recon-
nection jets with a component ?B that generates a con-
vection electric field (v (cid:2) B)/c that drives a J? that un-
dergoes resistive dissipation. This possibility corresponds
to the case for which the space and time averaged B in-
ferred by HMI mainly describes the latter part of this
process.

I? and I// are the unsigned NLR currents. Then Qi =

larger than I// at all times of moderate or larger increases
in I?, and that I// is essentially constant, or varies by
no more than a factor (cid:24) 2–3 for all times. Since Qi /

almost all times. Resistive heating in the SF ARs is due
almost entirely to dissipation of non-force-free currents.

This suggests that the occurrence of Qi values in the first

range in an AR is plausibly predictive of the subsequent
occurrence of M or X flares, while the occurrence of Qi
values in the second range in an AR is plausibly predictive
of flares not larger than C class. However, comparison of
the figures also suggests that a correlation of Qi values in

7 Similarity of the CDFs of QQQiii and coronal
(cid:13)ares, and the possibility of self organized
criticality in the photospheric heating rate
distribution

The CDFs of Qi for each of the 14 ARs, for all SF ARs
collectively, for all C ARs collectively, and for all ARs
collectively are shown in Figs. 10–14. Log–log plots are
used since if N (Qi) = AQ(cid:0)s
i where A and s are constant
over some range of Qi, then log N (Qi) = (cid:0)s log Qi + log A
over this range, which is a line with slope (cid:0)s. CDFs with
these properties are called scale invariant since the value of

s does not depend on any physical scale over this range of
Qi. The lines that are fit to the data are generated by the
Matlab polyfit function over the range of Qi indicated in
each figure. In most cases the linear fits are very good over
the indicated ranges. In some cases the linear behavior
breaks down for N (Qi) ≲ 10. Visual inspection suggests
that in most cases this breakdown is due to an insufficient
number of data points for the higher values of Qi, in which
case the linear behavior would extend to higher values
of Qi if longer time series were used to provide better
statistics. However, for SF AR 1166 in Fig. 10 there is a
data point at Qi = 1029 ergs(cid:1)s(cid:0)1(cid:1)cm(cid:0)1, about 3.5 orders
of magnitude to the right of the bottom of the linear fit.
This suggests that for this AR the scale invariant behavior
breaks down for Qi ≳ 1026 ergs(cid:1)s(cid:0)1(cid:1)cm(cid:0)1.

The figures show that the CDFs of the 14 ARs exhibit
scale invariant behavior over ranges of Qi that extend over
(cid:24) 2–2.9 orders of magnitude for 3 ARs, and over (cid:24) 3:3–6.3

old value remains the same over the corresponding range
of Qi. This behavior is a necessary but not sufficient con-
dition for the system, here an AR NLR, to be in a state

of self organized criticality (SOC) [63]. SOC states arise
naturally during the evolution of dynamical systems with
extended spatial degrees of freedom, such as the photo-
sphere and corona. They are characterized by long range
spatial order, are stable in a narrow range of system pa-
rameter values, and exhibit a high degree of chaos and
noise [63–69], where chaos is deterministic but often in-
distinguishable from noise due to insufficient resolution.
The transition of a system into an SOC state is similar to
a phase transition in that the system makes a transition
from a state without long range order to one with long
range order.

For the SF ARs, s = (0:4472, 0.4579, 0.4708, 0.4742,
0.4858, 0.5101, 0.5143). For the C ARs, s = (0:3351,
0.4080, 0.4303, 0.4356, 0.4459, 0.5148, 0.5385). The range
of s is (cid:24) 0:34–0.54, with all but one value in the range
0.4–0.54. The mean, median, and standard deviation of
s for all SF ARs, all C ARs, and all ARs are, respec-
tively,
(0:4440; 0:4356; 0:0675),
and (0:4620; 0:4643; 0:0524). This shows there is little sta-
tistical variation in s among the 14 ARs, so s is largely
independent of individual AR properties.

(0:4800; 0:4742; 0:0252),

The scale invariant behavior of N (Qi), and the range,
mean values, and weak dependence of s on AR are similar

to the observed properties of the CDF N (E) for coronal
flares, where E is the total energy released, defined as
the total amount of magnetic energy converted into par-
ticle energy. It is observed that N (E) / E(cid:0)(cid:11)E where (cid:11)E
varies little from one AR to another, being largely inde-
pendent of the differences between ARs such as area, total
unsigned magnetic flux, and sunspot distribution [70–72].
Observation based estimates of (cid:11)E have been made for
over 40 years [70, 73–79]. For HXR, SXR, and (cid:13) ray based
constructions of N (E), it is found that (cid:11)E (cid:24) 0:40–0.88,
with almost all values in the range of (cid:24) 0:4–0.6.

These observation based values for (cid:11)E are consistent
with: (i) Values of (cid:11)E predicted by first principles, SOC
theories, which give (cid:11)E (cid:24) 0:4–0.67 [76–79]. (ii) Values
of (cid:11)E predicted by simulations of the solutions to lat-
tice based avalanche models, which give (cid:11)E (cid:24) 0:40–0.57
[76, 77, 80–83]. (iii) Values of (cid:11)E (cid:24) 0:35–0.6 predicted
by semi-empirical, force-free magnetic field models for the
free energy distribution of magnetic discontinuities in non-
flaring AR coronae [84].

The fact that the ranges of s and (cid:11)E are similar, and
that s and (cid:11)E show relatively little variation with AR sug-
gests a common origin of the photospheric N (Qi) and the
coronal N (E). If they do have a common origin, a question

is whether SOC theory can help clarify it. The first appli-
cation of SOC theory to propose a physical process that
gives rise to N (E) is presented in Refs. [80, 81]. There
it is proposed that the solar corona is in an SOC state,
and that flares consist of a time series of random, spa-
tially distributed avalanches of sub-resolution magnetic
reconnection events that trigger one another. If this the-
ory of flares as a coronal process is correct, a question is
whether the photosphere is also in an SOC state, and ex-
hibits similar avalanche type flaring events with a similar
CDF on smaller energy and spatial scales. The form of
N (Qi) found here for 14 ARs suggests the answer to this
question may be affirmative for the SF ARs, which have
the largest Qi spikes. For C ARs, the results presented
here suggest their photospheres are in an SOC state, but
the connection between this apparent property and flaring
in these regions is less evident. The similarity of N (E) and
N (Qi) discussed above does not prove ARs enter an SOC
state when Qi exceeds a threshold value, but it is evidence
in support of this possibility, and implies it is important
to further explore this possibility using time series from
more ARs for better statistics.

SOC related reconnection avalanches are not the only
possible process that can give rise to the observed N (E).
A model based on the idea of a flare being due to a single

energy release event with a range of possible energies, and
of the observed N (E) being due to the statistical distri-
bution of such events is presented by Wheatland & Craig
[85].

The similarity of N (Qi) and N (E), and the suggestion
that photospheric AR NLRs are in an SOC state are con-
sistent with the observation based findings of Uritsky et al.
[86, 87] for the CDFs of photospheric magnetic field fluc-
tuations and overlying coronal heating events in the quiet
Sun. Uritsky et al. [86] generate time series of increases
in the MDI LOS magnetic flux, and in the intensity of
overlying coronal EUV emission flux images from the So-
lar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet
Imager (STEREO EUVI, [88]) in quiet Sun regions. Define
the CDF P (I) of each of these time series as the proba-
bility of the occurrence of an intensity or LOS magnetic
flux increase (cid:21) I. Uritsky et al. [86] computed dP (I)/dI
for each time series, and show they are scale invariant
power law distributions with exponents 1:48 (cid:6) 0:03 for the
photospheric LOS magnetic flux, and 1:47 (cid:6) 0:03 for the
coronal EUV emission flux (see table 3 of Ref. [86]). It fol-
lows that the corresponding P (I), which are the integrals
of dP (I)/dI over I, are also scale invariant power law dis-
tributions, with exponents (cid:24) 0:48 and 0:47, respectively,
which are essentially identical. Further analysis by Uritsky

et al. [87] leads to the conclusion that in the quite Sun, the
photosphere and corona are in magnetically coupled SOC
states, the quiet corona is heated by SOC-like avalanches
of magnetic energy dissipation, and the heating on spatial
scales > 3 (cid:2) 103 km is driven by turbulent photospheric
convection. Uritsky et al. [86] identified increases in the
photospheric LOS magnetic flux as proxies for energy re-
lease events in the photosphere, and show they are corre-
lated with coronal heating events identified by increases in
EUVI flux. This raises the question of whether increases in
the AR NLR heating rate Qi computed here is correlated
with the overlying coronal heating rate. Another study
involving coronal observations is necessary to answer this
question, and might also give insight into a possible corre-
lation between the times of enhancements in Qi, and the
times of subsequent flaring.

8 180 degree ambiguity error

There is 180 degree ambiguity phase error in the HMI data
[34]. It results from the fact that HMI can determine the
direction of the magnetic field component perpendicular

to the LOS, denoted B?LOS, only up to a sign, so the
direction can be in error by an angle (cid:25). The error tends to
be larger (smaller) in regions where B is smaller (larger).
The error can cause a spurious gradient in B?LOS between
adjacent pixels, and a corresponding change in J . Since
many of the results in this paper are based on a calculation
of J , it is important to estimate if ambiguity phase error
causes significant error in this calculation.

Phase error correction algorithms are implemented in
the HMI data pipeline by the HMI team. The algorithms
are not perfect, so it is important to estimate the residual
ambiguity error. In the Cartesian coordinate system used
here, this is done using two tests, one global, and one local.
Both tests are based on using time sequences of images of
the horizontal magnetic field Bh = (Bx; By) in an AR to
determine where Bh reverses direction in one time step.
This is done for several ARs. Here Bh (cid:24) B?LOS for the
near-disk centered ARs used here. It is assumed that if
Bh changes direction by (cid:6)(cid:25) to within 1% in a pixel in one
time step, that change is due to ambiguity error, rather
than real magnetic field dynamics.

The global test consists of randomly selecting 5 time
consecutive images of Bx and By in each AR pixel, com-

The local test is as follows. Several pixels in which
a large current spike occurs are selected. For each such
pixel the 3 (cid:2) 3 pixel block with this pixel at its center is
selected. If t is the time at which the current spike occurs
in the center pixel, B in each pixel in the block at times
(t(cid:0)∆t; t; t+∆t) is determined, where ∆t = 12 minutes. It
is then checked if there are any reversals in the directions
of Bh anywhere in the pixel block from t (cid:0) ∆t to t, and
from t to t + ∆t. Any such reversal indicates ambiguity
error, and suggests that the current spike is due to this
error. No such reversals are found for any of the spikes
tested. This test is especially important because it is a
direct test of whether a current spike is due to ambiguity
error.

The spikes that are analyzed using the local test are

Jh (cid:24) BhjBx;x + By;yj/jBzj, where the terms involving
Bz;x and Bz;y are omitted since they are found not to
make a major contribution to the large spikes. It is found
that the larger spikes are caused by the larger values of
Bh/jBzj, which are due to a simultaneous occurrence of
smaller values of jBzj and larger values of Bh. Comparably
small values of jBzj occur inside and outside NLRs, and
in SF and C ARs, but the values of Bh associated with
the larger spikes tend to be orders of magnitude larger in
the NLRs of SF ARs than elsewhere.

The conclusion from the analysis in this section is that
it is unlikely that ambiguity error has a significant effect
on the model results. In particular, the large spikes in the
heating rate Qi are not caused by ambiguity error.

As discussed in Section 5.4, the large spikes in Qi are
due to spikes in J?, and J? generally dominates resis-
tive heating in the ARs, especially in the SF ARs. For
the spikes analyzed in this section, the current spikes are
due to spikes in Jh. It follows that J? (cid:24) Jh for these
spikes. This suggests that at the location of at least the
large spikes, J and B are horizontal and orthogonal. At
z = 0, Eqs. (7) and (8) imply Jh (cid:24) cBh/(4(cid:25)L0) (cid:24)
(c/4(cid:25))@Bh/@z. Together these results suggest the strong
heating events occur in horizontal current sheets associ-
ated with large vertical gradients of Bh at or near the
photosphere. Because the HMI spatial resolution of B is
(cid:24) 1′′, it follows that the areas of these sheets are ≲ the
characteristic area of a granule.

9 Data quality

The possibility that the largest current spikes are due to
poor quality of the un-filtered data was investigated as fol-
lows. For each HMI image there is a data quality keyword
value (henceforth “value”), with a zero value meaning
good quality, and a non-zero value meaning poor quality.
The values were plotted for all raw data images of Bx; By;
and Bz for the 14 AR time series analyzed. For each AR
the value was checked for the images containing the two
largest spikes, and sometimes additional spikes in Qi. The
values were all zero. The images analyzed showed a pe-
riod of about 12 hours between consecutive non-zero val-
ues. This is probably due to the spurious 12 hour Doppler
period.

An example of this value analysis is shown in Fig. 15.
The figure shows the values for 352 time consecutive im-
ages of Bx for NOAA AR 1166, including the time interval
in the AR 1166 plot in Fig. 4. Of these images, 27 have
nonzero values. These 27 images have image numbers 31,

a quantity is evaluated at the photosphere (z = 0) is dropped. It
is understood that all quantities are evaluated at the photosphere.

largest values of Qi in the plot for AR 1166 in Fig. 4, cor-
responding to Qi (cid:21) 1024 ergs(cid:1)s(cid:0)1(cid:1)cm(cid:0)1. These 12 values
correspond to image numbers 17, 24, 49, 52, 59, 106, 164,
232, 241, 260, 292, and 324. The figure shows that none of
these Qi values occur at times of poor data quality. The
figure also shows the approximate 12 hour periodicity of
the nonzero values. The corresponding plots for By and
Bz are identical to Fig. 15.

10 Conclusions

The spurious Doppler induced periods in the HMI B time
series can introduce significant error into photospheric
quantities derived from B. In particular, they can cause
large errors in calculations of the photospheric J , which
represents free magnetic energy in the photosphere, and
determines the Lorentz force (J (cid:2) B)/c, and J (cid:1) E. They
can also cause errors in the calculation of E if it is com-
puted from E (cid:24) (cid:0)c(cid:0)1@A/@t, with A determined by solv-
ing ∇ (cid:2) A = B. As discussed in Section 3, as a result
of filtering out these periods, our analysis is based on a
high frequency representation of the photospheric mag-
netic field. However, in Section 5.2 it is shown there is
a plausible correlation between larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj,
spikes in Qi, and M and X flares. Larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj
correspond to larger values of jdB/dtj, which correspond
to the higher frequency component of B. This suggests
that filtering out the lower frequency component of B re-
tains the dynamics of B most important for flare predic-

tion.

The largest photospheric heating events predicted by
the model, corresponding to the largest spikes in Qi for
ARs with M or X flares are plausibly correlated in time
with the subsequent occurrence of M or X flares several
hours to several days later.

The larger values of Qi are convection driven in that
they are driven almost entirely by the conversion of bulk
flow kinetic energy into thermal energy, rather than by
the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy, at
least for the time and space averaged magnetic field in-
ferred by HMI. It is possible that reconnection initiates
the energy conversion process that includes acceleration
of bulk flow across magnetic field lines, which generates a
convection electric field that drives current that is resis-
tively dissipated. Higher resolution is needed to determine
if this is the case.

The times of larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj are plausibly cor-
related with the subsequent occurrence of large spikes in
Qi, and M and X flares. Such a correlation is expected
since, by Faraday’s law, larger values of jd(cid:8)i/dtj imply
larger values of the induction electric field, through which
magnetic energy is converted into particle energy, which
drives flares. By contrast, time series of the NLR inte-
grated unsigned magnetic flux, of the magnetic energy
density, and of j(cid:8)ij do not suggest a correlation with Qi
or flares.

The CDFs of coronal flares and of Qi are essentially
identical
in that they are both scale invariant power
law distributions, and have power law index ranges that
strongly overlap and are largely independent of AR. This
suggests that the processes that drive coronal flares and
photospheric resistive heating are the same process oper-
ating on two largely different sets of spatial and temporal
scales.

The form of the CDFs of Qi for the 14 ARs is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for AR photospheres to be in
an SOC state, at least outside of flaring times. For ARs
that produce M or X flares, the near identity of the CDFs
of Qi and coronal flares suggests that the formation of an
SOC state is part of a coupled evolution of the corona and
photosphere into SOC states that relax to states of lower
magnetic energy through avalanches in the conversion of
magnetic energy into particle energy. Results also suggest
that ARs that produce weaker or no flares also evolve into
an SOC state, but one that is relatively stable, consistent
with the result that the spikes in Qi for these ARs are
several orders of magnitude smaller than those for the ARs
that produce M or X flares.

These model predicted correlations between flare times
and Qi and jd(cid:8)i/dtj, and the near identity of the photo-
spheric CDF of Qi and the observed CDF of coronal flares
indicate the model and model output analysis might be
the basis of a new and useful algorithm for flare predic-
tion. In order to determine the degree to which it is useful
with statistical certainty, an analysis of at least hundreds

of ARs involving automated feature recognition and cor-
relation algorithms is necessary.
