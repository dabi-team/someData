We  report  on  the  structural  and  superconducting  properties  of  nanocrystalline  tungsten  thin 

films growth by sputtering at room temperature with an N2:Ar mixture (N2 from 3% to 50%). The 

crystalline phases were identified by comparing as-grown and thermal annealed thin films. For 
N2/(Ar+N2)  mixtures  between  3  and  10  %,  the  films  display  nanocrystalline  b -W  phase. 
Coexistence of b -W and W2N phases are observed for gas mixtures with N2 between 20 % and 

40%.  A  detailed  study  of  the  superconducting  properties  as  function  of  the  thickness  was 

performed for W films  growth with 8 % N2 mixtures. For this concentration, the nitrogen atoms 

increase the disorder at the nanoscale reducing the grain size and avoiding the crystallization of 
a -W.  The  superconducting  critical  temperature  (Tc  =  4.7  K)  is  thickness  independent  for  films 

thicker than ~ 17 nm. Below this thickness, the Tc value decreases systematically being 3.1 K 
for 4 nm thick films. Our study provides a simple method for the fabrication of nanocrystalline b -

W thin films with potential applications in superconducting devices.

1. Introduction 

Tungsten is a metal with several applications in micro-electromechanical devices [1,2]. 

W films  exist  in  two  allotropic forms:  alpha  (α)-W  (body-centered  cubic  structure)  and 

beta  (β)-W  (A15  structure).  The  electrical  resistivity  of  α-W  is  always  lower  than  the 

electrical resistivity of β-W. A distinctive feature of W is that displays superconductivity 

[3,4]. The superconducting critical temperature Tc can be enhanced from 12 mK for α-

W  to  up  5.2  K  for  the  coexistence  of  nanocrystalline  β-W  and  amorphous  structures

[5,6].  A  simple  method  to  study  the  influence  of  the  microstructure  on  the  electronic 

properties of nanocrystalline W is growing thin films. Among the different techniques for 

the development of thin films, sputtering allows the growth of high-quality samples even 

at  a  low  substrate  temperature.  The  structural,  mechanical  and  electronic  properties 

usually  depend  on  the  deposition  parameters  [7,8,9].  Extremely  disordered  structures 

can  be  achieved  by  both  reducing  the  deposition  temperature  and  adding  impurities. 
For example, nanocrystalline W thin films with coexistence of β− and a - phases can be 

obtained  by  sputtering  at  room  temperature  [8].  In  addition,  nanocrystalline  β−W  has 

been  stabilized  in  thin  films  growth  at  low  temperatures  by  reactive  sputtering  with 

Ar/O2 [10] and Ar/N2 mixtures [9,11]. The high stability of metallic W growth in reactive 

atmospheres  can  be  related  to  low  heat  of  formation  [12].  While  it  is  clear  that  the 

interstitial impurities and the structural disorder stabilize the β-phase, only a few works 

have  discussed  their  influence  on  the  thermal  stability  and  the  superconducting 

properties [8,11,13]. 

In this work, we analyze the presence of superconductivity in nanometric grain size W 

thin  films  growth  at  room  temperature  in  an  N2/Ar  mixture  (N2  from  3%  to  50%).  The 

results  show  that  the  microstructure,  crystalline  structure  and  the  presence  of 

superconductivity depend on the N2 concentration in the gas mixture. The comparison 

between as-grown and thermal annealed films shows that the superconductivity can be 

related  to  nanocrystalline  β-W  phase  and  amorphous  phases. We  study  in  detail  the 

superconducting  properties  for  films  growth  with  an  8%  N2  mixture.  For  this 

concentration, no features related with W2N were observed for X-ray diffraction in as-

grown  samples  (nitrogen  is  mainly  an  interstitial  impurity).  The  study  of  the 

superconducting properties was performed for films with thickness between 3 nm and 

160 nm. The superconducting critical temperature (Tc = 4.7 K) is thickness independent 

for  films  thicker  than  ~  17  nm.  Below  this  thickness,  the  Tc  value  decreases 

systematically being 3.1 K for 4 nm thick films. The analysis of the upper critical fields 

Hc2  indicates  that  the  extrapolated  value  at  zero  increases  as  the  films  thickness 

decreases, which can be related to changes in the microstructure and reduction in the 

grain size average. 

2. Materials and methods 

W  films  were  deposited  on  Si  (100)  wafers  by  sputtering  in  an  Ar  /  N2  mixture.  The 
substrates (»  1x10-4 m2) were etched with HF 6%. The films were grown using a power 

 
 
3 

of 50 watts with a 99.99% purity W target (diameter: 0.038 m). During the deposition, 

the  substrate  is  positioned  directly  over  the  targets  at 

0.055 m.  The  substrate 

temperature  was  modified  from  room  temperature  (RT)  to  673  K.  The  base  pressure 
was  »   6.7x10-5  Pa.  The  total  pressure  during  the  deposition  of  the  films  was  kept 

∼

constant in 0.67 Pa. The N2 partial pressure was modified from 3% to 50%. Ultra-high 

purity Ar (99.999%) and N2 (99.999%) were used as gas sources. The deposition rate 
is  »     23  nm/min  for  N2  concentrations  between  3  and  10  %  and  decreases 
systematically to »  20 nm/min for gas mixtures with 50 % of N2. Thermal annealing was 
performed  in  a  vacuum  atmosphere  (» 1.33x10-4  Pa)  at  973  K.  Wherever  used,  the 

notation [dWX-T], indicates a tungsten film with a thickness of d [nm], and X nitrogen 

[%] mixture and T the growth temperature [K], respectively.  

X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  was  used  to  characterize  the  crystal  structure  of  the  films 
(Panalytical Empyrean equipment). The structural analysis was performed based on Q
2Q

  scans  under  Cu  Kα  radiation  operated  at  40 kV  and  30 mA  using  an  angular 

-

resolution  of  0.02°.  The  film  thickness  was  calibrated  by  low-angle  X-ray  reflectivity 

(XRR). Profile fitting was done using the Parratt32 code [14]. The electrical transport 

measurements were performed on 1 mm (length) x 0.02 mm (width) bridges using the 

standard four-terminal transport technique (see sketch in Fig. 1).   

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. Influence of the N2/Ar mixture on the crystalline structure and electrical transport of 

W thin films 

Figure 2a shows the XRD pattern for W films growth using different N2:Ar mixtures. The 

results  show  that  for  N2  mixtures  up  10  %,  the  XRD  patterns  display  the  (200)  and 
(210)  reflections  of  the  b

  phase.  For  N2  mixtures  between  20%  and  40%,  the  (200) 
reflection is not observed and the (210) is at 2q  ~ 38.5°.  The shift in the angle may be 

related to a long lattice parameter due to higher disorder produced by a large amount 
of  interstitial  nitrogen.  The  XRD  pattern  for  [138W50-RT]  displays  a  peak  at  2q   ~ 

36.45°,  which  could  be  related  to  the (111) reflection  of  nanocrystalline  W2N  [9].  The 

grain size average (D), extracted from the analysis of the peak width using the Scherrer 

formula,  decreases  as  the  N2  in  the  mixture  (the  exception  is  [138W50-RT]).  The 

estimated  D  values  are  9  nm  for  [160W8-RT],  6.7  nm  for  [160W10-RT],  2.1  nm  for 

[155W20-RT], 1.8 nm for [145W30-RT] and 7.9 nm for [138W50-RT]. It is important 

to note that sputtering  usually produces columnar structures, which implies that the 

 
 
 
4 

grains  could  be  elongated  at  the  growth  direction.  To analyze  in  detail  the  origin  of 

the  peaks  in  the  XRD  patterns,  the  films  were  annealed  at  973  K  for  1  hour  in 

vacuum.  Figure  2b  shows  the  results  for  [160W8-RT],  [155W20-RT],  [145W30-RT] 

and  [138W50-RT].  Thin  films  growth  with  N2  concentration  up  10%  display  phase 
coexistence  between  a -W  and  W2N  (minority  phase),  which  suggests  that  the 
nitrogen in the films growth at RT is an interstitial impurity. The D value for a -W is »

17 nm. Thin films with mixtures between 20 % and 30 % display coexistence of W2N 
(D  »   40  nm  and  70  nm,  respectively)  and  metallic  W  (minority  phase).  Finally,  the 

XRD  pattern  for  [138W50-RT]  displays  the  (111)  and  (200)  reflections  of  the  W2N 

phase  [9].  The  shift  to  lower  angles  of  both  reflections  respect  to  tabulated  values 
can be related to interstitial nitrogen [15]. The D value is »  12 nm.   

Figure  3a  shows  a  summary  of  the  electrical  transport  for  thin  films  growth  using 

different N2 mixtures. The criteria used to determine the Tc is indicated in [138W50-RT]. 

Most of the films display superconductivity with Tc between 3 K and 4.9 K (see Fig. 3a). 

The exception is [155W20-RT]. The Tc values are in the range of amorphous W [5,6]. 

Moreover,  for  N2  mixtures  lower  than  10%,  the  fluctuations  in  Tc  are  similar  to  that 

reported in ref. [8]. We attribute the presence of superconductivity for N2 mixtures richer 

than  20%  to  the  coexistence  of  amorphous  W  and  nitrides.  The  disorder  at  the 

nanoscale for all the films is evident from the low value of the residual resistivity ratio 
(RRR =R300K/R10K) »  0.9-0.97 (not shown). Following the analysis of the structural and 

superconducting  properties  will  be  focused  on  thin  films  growth  using  an  8  %  N2 
mixture, which according to XRD data produces mainly nanocrystalline b -W.   

3.2.  Influence  of  the  deposition  temperature  on  structural  and  superconducting 
properties of nanocrystalline b -W thin films 

To  analyze  the  influence  of  deposition  temperature  on  the  microstructure  and  the 

electrical  transport,  160  nm  thick  W  thin  films  were  grown  at  different  temperatures 

using  an  8%  N2  mixture.  Figure  4a  shows  the  XRD  for  [160W8-RT],  [160W8-473], 

[160W8-573] and [160W8-673]. All the samples display a peak that can be attributed to 

the  (210)b   reflection.  The  peak  is  systematically  narrow  and  shifted  to  higher  angles 

when the deposition temperature is increased. The reduction in the peak width can be 

related with an increment in the grain size average. The shift in the peak position and 
the asymmetry to higher angles can be related with crystallization a -W and overlapping 

of  the  (210)b   and  (200)a   reflections  (see  for  example  [160W8-673]).  It  is  important  to 

 
 
 
5 

  reflection  is  lesser  evidenced  at 
note  that  the  asymmetry  corresponding  to  the  (200)a
673 K than 473 K. The differences may be related to an increment in the grain size and 

a  better  overlapping  due  to  a  reduction  of  the  peak  width.  Figure  4b  shows  the 
temperature  dependence  of  the  normalized  resistance  (R/R10K)  for  [160W8-RT], 

[160W8-473]  and [160W8-573].  The  results  show  that  Tc  decreases  systematically  as 

the  deposition  temperature  increases.  The  drop  in  Tc  could  be  related  to  the 
coexistence  of b -W  and  a -W  phases (evidenced  by  XRD).    As  we  will  discuss  in  the 

section 3.3, the reduction in the dimension of the superconducting paths decreases the 

Tc value. 

To  understand  the  influence  of  the  thermal  annealing  on  the  superconducting 

properties, we measure the upper critical fields (Hc2) in [160W8-RT] and [160W8-473]. 

For  polycrystalline  films,  the  anisotropy  g =

[160W8-RT]  are  8.5  nm  and  7.2  nm,  respectively.    We  now  turn  to  the  comparison 

between

2cH   is  »   1.7  for  [160W8-RT]  and  »   2.6  for  [160W8-473].  The

agreement with for [160W8-RT] [16]. On the other hand, g  = 2.6 is in agreement with

[160W8-473]  implies  the  presence  of  superconducting  paths thinner than  the  nominal

thickness  (reduction  of  the  superconductor  volume  due  to  crystallization  of  a -W). We 

discuss the features of the 2D behavior later when we analyze the Hc2(T) dependences 

for films with different thickness. 

3.3.  Thickness  dependence  of  the  structural  and  superconducting  properties  of 
nanocrystalline b -W thin films 

To  understand  the  influence  of  the  dimension  on  the  superconducting  properties  of 
nanocrystalline b -W thin films, we growth samples at room temperature using an 8% N2 

mixture  with  a  thickness  between  3  and  160  nm.  The  thicknesses  were  determined 

from  the  fits.  Figure  5a  shows  the  data  for  11.8  nm  and  22.8  nm  thick  W  films.  It  is 

important  to  note  that  the  best  fits  were  obtained  adding  an  interfacial  layer  of 

approximately  1  nm.  This  layer  was  not  considered  in  the  nominal  thickness  value. 

Figure 5b shows a summary of the thickness obtained from fits versus deposition time. 

The resulting growth rate average is of 21.0 (0.5) nm/min.   

Figure  6  shows  the XRD  pattern for  [11W8-RT], [23W8-RT], [70W8-RT]  and [160W8-
RT]. The results show reflections of the b

 phase. The peaks are wider as the thickness 

reduces,  which  can  be  related  to  size  and microstructural  effects.  The  thicknesses of 

the layers affect the reflections in the XRD (the peak width increases as the thickness 

reduces).  Moreover, higher disorder for the thinner films may be expected due to lower 

growth temperature average due to self-heating during the sputtering process (shorter 

growth times).  

Figure  7a  shows  the  normalized  resistance  of  W  films  with  different  thickness.  The 

results show that films thicker than 17 nm show a Tc = 4.7 K. Below this thickness, the 

Tc  value  decreases  systematically,  being  3.1  K  for  a  3.8  nm  thick  W  film.  The 
superconducting  transition  width  is  D Tc  =  Tc-Rzero  »   0.1  K  in  most  films.  A  slight 

broadening of the superconducting transition is observed in the thinner films, which can 

be  attributed  to  enhanced  thermal  fluctuations  when  the  thickness  falls  below  the 
coherence length x  [16]. The films display residual resistivity ratio (RRR = R300K/R10K) »  

0.93  –  1.04,  which  is  indicative  of  high  disorder  with  very  short  mean  free  path  (not 
shown).  The  resistivity  of  the  films  is  independent  of  the  thickness  r   (300  K)  »   1.5

2  (T) dependences, the Hc2 (0) values for [8W8-RT] and [17W8-RT] are »  9 T (x  
(0) = 6.0 nm) and 8 T (x  (0) = 6.4 nm), respectively. The comparison with [160W8-RT] 

$%(cid:10)

(see  Fig.  4c)  indicates  that  the  Hc2  (0)  increases  as  the  thickness  decreases.  This 

change could be attributed to the reduction in the grain size  with thickness discussed 

above.  The  increment  in  the  Hc2  (0)  values  in  nanocrystalline  systems  reducing  the 

grain size is also evidenced in other systems such as Mo2N thin films [19,20].   

The  temperature  dependence  of

2cH in  the  thin  films  with  thickness  lower  than 

approximately 4.4x  can be analyzed in the 2D limits:

limit).  The  equation  consider  that  in  the  dirty  limit  x (T)  =  0.855x (0)  (1-(T/Tc))-1/2  [16]. 

Although  the  predicted  temperature  dependences  of  superconducting  parameters  are 
for Tﬁ

 Tc, they usually are valid over a much wider temperature range. The fits using 

eq. 2 for

2cH [8W8-RT] with  x  (0) = 6.0 nm and [17W8-RT] with x  (0) = 6.4 nm are in 

good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data. It  is  important  to  note  that for [8W8-RT], 

||

2cH (2.8K) = 16 T and the extrapolation to zero is above 26 T. These values are above 

to the Pauli paramagnetic limit Hp ≈ 1.84 Tc (in Tesla for Tc in Kelvin) for isotropic BCS 

superconductors  [21].  Above  Hp,  it  is  expected  that  the  Zeeman  splitting  energy 

matches  the  superconducting  energy  gap  or  binding  energy  of  a  Copper  pair.  The 

presence  of  very  huge  Hc2  values  in  the  vortex-free  configuration  suggests  that  the 

same tolerance to the magnetic field should be observed in nanocrystalline nanowires. 

4. Summary 

The  superconducting  and  microstructural  properties  of  W  thin  films  fabricated  by 

sputtering in N2:Ar mixtures were studied. The microstructure and phases are strongly 

affected  by 

the  gas  mixture.  Nanocrystalline 

b -W  phase 

is  obtained 

for  N2 

concentration between 3% and 10 %.  Thin films growth at RT using  N2 concentration 
between 20 % and 40 % display coexistence of b -W and W2N phases.  It is important 
to note that for N2 concentration up 10 %, the nitrogen stabilizes the b -W phase. This 

 
 
 
8 

behavior is different to other metals such as tantalum [11] and molybdenum [19] where 

reactive mixtures of Ar/N2 produce nitrides.  
The study of the superconducting properties is focused in nanocrystalline b -W thin films 
growth  at  RT  using  8%  N2  mixtures.  Coexistence  of  b -W  and  a -W  phases  can  be 

induced  by  both  thermal  annealing  and  increment  in  the  deposition  temperature.  The 

phase  coexistence  reduces  the  superconductor  volume.  The  superconducting  critical 

temperature (Tc = 4.7 K) is thickness independent for films thicker than ~ 17 nm. The 

2   (T)  dependences  are  well  described  by  the  WHH  model  for  single  band 

$%(cid:10)
superconductors  in  the  dirty  limit.  The  extrapolated  Hc2  (0)  values  increase  as  the 

thickness reduces, which can be related to changes in the microstructure (small grain 

sizes  for  thinner  films).  On  the  other  hand,  the 

||

2cH (T)  dependences,  depending  on 

thickness, are well described considering surface superconductivity and the 2D model. 
Our  study  provides  a  simple  method  for  the  fabrication  of  nanocrystalline  b -W  with 

potential applications in superconducting devices.

Figure 8. a-b) Temperature dependence of the upper critical field (Hc2) with H parallel 
(||)  and  perpendicular  (^ )  to  the  surface  for  [8W8-RT]  and  [17W8-17],  respectively. 
Inset a) shows typical curves of normalized resistance (R/R10K) versus temperature for 
[8W8-RT] with H ||  surface (from right to left m 0H = 0, 8 T, 10 T, 12 T and 16 T).
