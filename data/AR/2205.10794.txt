ABSTRACT

Recent observations have shown that besides the characteristic multi-million degree component the
corona also contains a large amount of cool material called coronal rain, whose clumps are 10 − 100
times cooler and denser than the surroundings and are often organised in larger events termed showers.
Thermal instability (TI) within a coronal loop in a state of thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) is the
leading mechanism behind the formation of coronal rain but no investigation on showers exists to date.
In this study, we conduct a morphological and thermodynamic multi-wavelength study of coronal rain
showers observed in an active region (AR) oﬀ-limb with IRIS and SDO, spanning chromospheric to
transition region and coronal temperatures. Rain showers were found to be widespread across the
AR over the 5.45-hour observing time, with average length, width and duration of 27.37±11.95 Mm,
2.14±0.74 Mm, and 35.22±20.35 min, respectively. We ﬁnd a good correspondence between showers
and the cooling coronal structures consistent with the TNE-TI scenario, thereby properly identifying
coronal loops in the ‘coronal veil’, including the strong expansion at low heights and an almost zero
expansion in the corona. This agrees with previous work suggesting that the observed zero expansion
in the EUV is due to speciﬁc cross-ﬁeld temperature distribution. We estimate the total number of
showers to be 155 ± 40, leading to a TNE volume of 4.56 ± [3.71] × 1028 cm3, i.e. on the same order
of the AR volume. This suggests a prevalence of TNE over the AR indicating strongly stratiﬁed and
high-frequency heating on average.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal rain is one of the most mesmerizing features in the solar atmosphere, commonly found in quiescent (Schrijver
2001; Antolin & Rouppe van der Voort 2012) and ﬂaring active regions (Scullion et al. 2016; Jing et al. 2016), and also
over quiet Sun regions in hybrid prominence/coronal rain complexes (Li et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2022). It is a cooling
phenomenon believed to originate due to thermal instability within a coronal loop in a state of thermal non-equilibrium
(TNE) (Antolin 2020; Antolin & Froment 2022, and references therein). TNE describes a speciﬁc behaviour of the
plasma within a magnetic ﬂux tube that is unable to reach thermal equilibrium. The plasma undergoes a non-linear
cyclic behaviour (limit cycles), where each cycle is characterised by a (short) heating and a (long) cooling phase, also
called evaporation and condensation phases, respectively. Numerical simulations show that the most eﬃcient way of
achieving a TNE state is through strongly stratiﬁed and high-frequency heating (i.e., with heating events repeating
on a time scale shorter than the cooling timescale of the structure; M¨uller et al. 2003; Li et al. 2022). During the
heating, chromospheric evaporation occurs, and the loop gets dense and starts to radiate strongly. During the cooling,
catastrophic cooling can occur, leading to thermal instability (TI) locally in the corona (Claes & Keppens 2021). TI is
thought to generate cool and dense condensations called rain clumps, which subsequently fall as coronal rain towards
the surface under the action of various forces (Oliver et al. 2014; Fang et al. 2015). Periodic coronal rain is therefore
expected and is observed at the end of each TNE cycle (Auch`ere et al. 2018; Froment et al. 2020). On the other hand,
there are cases predicted by numerical simulations of TNE cycles with incomplete condensations or no condensations

at all for which the temperature of the plasma does not go down to chromospheric or transition region temperatures
(Froment et al. 2018).

Coronal rain shows a clumpy (∼300 km width) and elongated (∼700 km length) (Antolin & Rouppe van der Voort
2012) multi-thermal (< 103− > 105 K) structure along the magnetic ﬁeld lines and densities varying between 2× 1010
and 2.5× 1011 cm−3 (Antolin et al. 2015; Froment et al. 2020). A major characteristic of coronal rain is that it often
occurs at similar times over a signiﬁcantly wide structure (relative to the clump width), with a cross-ﬁeld length scale
of a few Mm, thereby deﬁning a ‘shower’, observed both in observations (Antolin & Rouppe van der Voort 2012) and
simulations (Fang et al. 2013). It has been suggested that the shower’s evolution and morphology reﬂect a coherent
heating function in neighboring ﬁeld lines, thus deﬁning a coronal volume with a similar thermodynamic evolution
that we may associate with the concept of coronal loop. Furthermore, the cross-ﬁeld quasi-simultaneous occurrence
seen in numerical simulations calls for a syncing mechanism acting across the ﬁeld, which has been explained through
the mechanism of sympathetic cooling. With 2.5D MHD simulations, Fang et al. (2013) showed that this mechanism
can come from fast mode perturbations. However, there is no observational study to date that properly quantiﬁes the
properties of showers, nor the spatial and temporal scales over which the sympathetic cooling occurs. Quantifying
showers is important since it provides a measure of the coronal volume involved in TNE and subject to TI over an
active region.

Because of the optically thin nature of the solar corona, the observational identiﬁcation of a coronal loop is strongly
ambiguous. The loop concept is further ill-deﬁned because of the fuzzy boundaries of what constitutes a coherent
structure in terms of its thermodynamic evolution. This is best exempliﬁed in 3D MHD modelling, where continuous
magnetic connectivity changes are obtained (Gudiksen & Nordlund 2005; Malanushenko et al. 2022). Yet, coherent
evolution on a global scale clearly exists, and a clear example of this is the long-period intensity pulsation (Auch`ere
et al. 2014; Froment et al. 2015). Debate also exists on the apparent lack of expansion of loop structures in the EUV
(Watko & Klimchuk 2000; Klimchuk 2000; DeForest 2007; L´opez Fuentes et al. 2008a), which may be explained by
non-trivial density and coronal temperature cross-ﬁeld distribution in expanding ﬂux tubes (Peter & Bingert 2012).

In this study, we provide a statistical investigation of showers over an active region. We present their morphological
properties in Section 3.1 and investigate the cooling behaviour of the plasma to understand the relation with TNE-TI
in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 3.3, we estimate the TNE volume in the active region. A discussion and conclusion
are given in Section 3.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND METHODS

The active region chosen for this study, shown in Figure 1a, is NOAA 12661 and was observed on 2 June 2017
between 07:28:00 UT and 12:54:39 UT at the East limb by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De
Pontieu et al. 2014) slit-jaw imager (SJI) in 1400 ˚A and 2796 ˚A. We also study the observations of this region in
seven channels (304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 335 ˚A, 94 ˚A, and 131 ˚A) by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). The IRIS/SJI ﬁeld of view
(FOV) for this region is 232(cid:48)(cid:48) × 182(cid:48)(cid:48). The co-alignment routine between the AIA and the SJI channels was achieved by
matching the solar limb and on-disk features at similar times between AIA 1600 and SJI 2832, which form in similar
low chromospheric conditions.

We applied an automatic detection routine to trace coronal rain based on the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT)
following the procedure of Schad (2017). The RHT code provides the spatial mean angle, which denotes the spatial
inclination in the FOV of the rain’s trajectory, and the time occurrence for each rain pixel. A pair of showers may
have very similar trajectories but occur at diﬀerent times. Similarly, they may occur at similar times and overlap each
other but have diﬀerent trajectories. Hence, to identify the shower events we used a semi-automatic algorithm that
uses both the spatial mean angle and the time occurrence outputs. This is achieved by creating a new array obtained
by the multiplication of the spatial mean angle and the time occurrence data and a shower is deﬁned by a range of
values in this trajectory-time domain. This procedure eﬀectively diﬀerentiates the cases of spatial or temporal overlap
highlighted above. To identify a shower we applied the ‘region grow’ routine of the Interactive Data Language (IDL)
(common in Medicine science) to this new trajectory-time array. This routine is a space ﬁlling algorithm that allows to
select a group of pixels within a speciﬁc range of values in the domain deﬁned by a standard deviation. The algorithm
uses an initial pixel belonging to a shower (as seed) and given a standard deviation (which determines the range of
values to look for in the trajectory-time domain) all the pixels belonging to a shower are identiﬁed. The standard
deviation is carefully selected by visually determining the possible trajectory and time range values. We repeat this
process for each shower by selecting 50 starting positions all over the FOV and across the time sequence. The selection
is also based on the shower’s visibility in the FOV. Preference was given to signiﬁcantly isolated events, thus reducing
any possible remaining errors due to overlaps. Since most of the rain clumps are visible across all channels, most (if
not all) showers can be seen in each channel. Considering this, we manually chose 50 shower events. We then analysed
their properties in each channel (see panels a, b and c in Figure 2).

To calculate the shower width, for each pixel within a shower deﬁned by the region grow algorithm we draw a
perpendicular line to the rain trajectory. The width of the shower at that pixel is then given by the number of
adjacent shower pixels. By repeating this process along the length of the shower we can deﬁne the spine of the shower,
and piece-wise sum the pixels along the spine to recover the shower length. The shower duration is simply determined
by the ﬁrst and last snapshots in which the shower (or a part of it) is seen in the FOV.

The AIA 304 channel is dominated by He II 303.8 ˚A plasma emission at log T ≈ 5. However, the channel also
includes hotter emission at log T ≈ 6.17, mainly from Si XI 303.32 ˚A. The morphology of both emitting structures is
strongly diﬀerent, the former being clumpy since it is emitted by the rain while the latter is diﬀuse since it is emitted
mainly by the surrounding corona. To maximise the rain detection in AIA 304 (and to minimise possible errors) we
removed the diﬀuse emission from the AIA 304 images using the Blind Source Separation technique, following the
procedure of Dudok de Wit et al. (2013).

We also use the Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM) algorithm of Cheung et al. (2015) based on the Basis Pursuit
method to estimate the temperature variation of the loops hosting the showers. Observations taken from six EUV
channels of SDO/AIA (94 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, and 335 ˚A) were used to calculate the emission measure
distribution for each pixel.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Morphology of Showers

Figure 1a shows the active region under study combining SJI 2796, SJI 1400, and AIA 171. The panels b to i in
the ﬁgure show 8 examples of showers with their corresponding length, width and time duration, determined with the
methods outlined in section 2. These showers have been selected based on their relatively isolated and clean coronal
emission (in blue). Note that the dotted lines, based on SJI 2796 contours, match well the coronal structure, which
suggests that the loops and showers are very similar in width. Furthermore, we note that the showers occur mostly
in one of the two loop legs, and only for some the shower encompasses the full loop structure, including the apex.

distribution of shower lengths (d), widths (e), and time durations (f), with the corresponding average and standard deviation
in the inner caption. Average shower width and standard deviation with height (g).

For the few cases in which showers occur along both loop legs we take the average of both in the respective measured
quantity (width, length and duration). Based on visual inspection, we estimate showers to occupy a third of the loop
length on average.

The top three panels in Figure 2 show all the traced 50 shower events in SJI 2796, SJI 1400, and AIA 304, and the
colors indicate their time occurrence. Some relatively minor diﬀerences are seen between the channels, which are due
to diﬀerences in intensity (opacity of the line) and contrast with the background, the amount of noise (instrument
sensitivity), the spatial resolution of the instrument and also diﬀerences in the occurrence with height. In any case,
the showers can be clearly distinguished and appear ubiquitous over the active region. Panels d and e of Figure 2 show
1D histogram distributions of the lengths and widths of showers, respectively. We obtain a very similar average shower
length and width across the channels. Namely, average lengths of 28.24±11.81 Mm for SJI 2796, 27.36±11.11 Mm
for SJI 1400, and 26.50±12.92 Mm for AIA 304, and average shower widths of 2.27±0.74 Mm, 1.98±0.75 Mm, and
2.16±0.72 Mm, respectively. Due to the higher noise, lower sensitivity and lower opacity in SJI 1400 and AIA 304
compared to SJI 2796, the lengths and widths appear slightly shorter. A detailed analysis of these diﬀerences between
the channels is given in Sahin et al. (in preparation).

Showers are relatively long-lived. They have similar time duration distributions across the channels (35.29±19.80 Mm
for SJI 2796, 34.61±21.69 Mm for SJI 1400, and 35.75±19.55 Mm for AIA 304, see Figure 2f) and can last as long as
80 minutes. The average width variations with height are shown on panel g in Figure 2, where zero height denotes the
solar limb. There is almost no expansion in the upper corona up to 40 Mm height. On the other hand, very strong
expansion also be seen below 12 Mm. The rain at the apex of loops is not traced very well by the RHT routine due to
the low velocities (particularly when the angle between the loop planes and the line-of-sight is small). This gives rise
to strong variations in the measured widths that can be seen above a height of 40 Mm in Figure 2.

Many loop structures hosting the showers become bright in the EUV at their apex, prior or during the catastrophic
cooling and appearance of coronal rain. An example of this is shown in Figure 3 and Animation 3, where Shower

19+20 is displayed (see also panels d and e in Figure 1). In order to study the thermodynamic evolution more closely,
we focus on shower events that are relatively isolated, thus minimising loop overlapping (Shower 19+20 and Shower
32 in Figure 2 on panels d and e, respectively).

Figure 4 (and the corresponding animation) presents the DEM results for various temperature bins corresponding
to Shower 19+20 (marked in Figure 1). The apex of the loop hosting this shower can be identiﬁed in almost all EM
maps inside the solid-white contour area. The shower event starts at 08:54:29 UT and lasted 48 minutes. However,
we investigated the DEM from one hour before the start of the shower. While widespread cooling from coronal
temperatures across the FOV can be seen, the cooling is particularly clear in this loop. In the region that is determined
by solid white contour (apex of the loop), we have an increase in the DEM in the cooler temperature bins, which
constitutes evidence of loop cooling.

To see the cooling trend more clearly, we show in Figure 5 the scaled total DEM over the loop apex (solid white-
contour line in Figure 3 and Figure 4) with respect to time. We compare the evolution of the emission at hot
temperatures with that at cool temperatures, seen in the histograms corresponding to coronal rain pixels for these
showers, not only at the apex but also along the legs. A steady decrease of the EM at hot temperatures (log T =
6.3−6.5) can be observed for both events (Shower 19+20 and Shower 32) up to 20 min prior (case 19+20) or right until
the start of the shower (case 32), while at cool coronal temperatures (log T = 6 − 6.1) we see an increasing trend. For
the case of Shower 19+20, the log T = 5.8 − 5.9 curves show a decrease prior to the shower event followed by a broad
peak over the time the shower appears at the apex. The emission at transition region temperatures (log T = 5.6 − 5.7)
is more variable, but also increases at the time of shower appearance. The AIA 304 emission, dominated by He II with
formation temperatures of ≈ log T = 5, exhibits a small peak 5 min prior to the rain appearance in the SJI channels
(log T = 4 − 4.8), and a larger peak that coincides with the SJI peaks. The former peak corresponds to a small rain
clump in the loop that can actually be seen in all channels but is not detected by the RHT routine due to its low
emission.

The EUV emission variation is interpreted as the cooling of plasma, with strong variations prior to the shower
appearance probably due to continuous cooling passing through temperature ranges and also moving out of the apex.
The EUV variations seen during the shower appearance are probably due to the Condensation Corona Transition Region
(CCTR), as expected from numerical modelling (Antolin et al. 2022). The Shower 32 behaves slightly diﬀerently than
Shower 19+20. The rain is seen to stay longer at the apex (40 min, almost as twice the time for shower 19+20) before
falling towards the surface of the Sun. The cooling trend can also be clearly seen in the DEM-weighted temperature
plots (Figure 5, bottom). Here, as expected, the hot temperature emission dominates, so the average temperature is
still coronal.

3.3. TNE Volume

Here we aim at estimating the volume aﬀected by TNE over the active region. Given the very good match found
between the shower widths and coronal loop widths, as well as the signiﬁcant loop portion occupied by showers, we
use the properties of the rain clumps and showers for the TNE volume calculation. We divide this calculation into
the following steps, which we perform for each channel. Since rain is dynamic and falling on average, two successive
snapshots may have an overlap of rain pixels in the FOV area, depending on the clump length, velocity and instrument
cadence. The length and area of this overlap is:

< length overlap > = < lclump > −cadence× < vclump >
< area overlap > = < length overlap > × < wclump >,

where < lclump >, < wclump > and < vclump > denote, respectively, the average clump’s length, width and speed.

We approximate the area in the FOV occupied by a single clump as:

Then, the fraction of rain overlapping between 2 consecutive images is:

< area clump >=< lclump > × < wclump >

< f raction >=

< area overlap >
< area clump >

The number of pixels in the non-overlapping area is then given by:

Nno overlap = Nθxy × (1− < f raction >),

where f denotes the average fraction of the loop occupied by a shower (we take f = 1/3) and we approximate a shower
as a cylinder.

To estimate the number of expected showers (in Equation 6) we used the average clump’s width < wclumps >
(1.36 ± 0.35, 0.88 ± 0.27, and 0.97 ± 0.27 Mm for the AIA 304, SJI 1400, and SJI 2796, respectively) and length
< lclumps > (11.53 ± 7.04, 6.84 ± 4.77, and 8.99 ± 6.48 Mm for the AIA 304, SJI 1400, and SJI 2796, respectively)
(Sahin et al. in preparation). The number of expected shower events found are 185 ± 39, 208 ± 77, and 71 ± 4 for the

9

SJI 2796, SJI 1400, and AIA 304, respectively. The TNE volume is found to be 6.34 ± 4.91 × 1028 cm3 for SJI 2796,
5.26 ± 4.52 × 1028 cm3 for SJI 1400, and 2.07 ± 1.71 × 1028 cm3 for AIA 304. We expect the estimated TNE volume
to be a lower estimate since the coronal rain detection conditions used for the RHT routine are strict to avoid any
inﬂuence from noise, while the rain intensity can sometimes be on the same order of the noise (see Schad 2017; Sahin
et al. in preparation, for detailed information).

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The ﬁrst major question we address is whether the coronal volume occupied by a shower can provide a proper
deﬁnition or help identify what we loosely observationally attribute as a coronal loop. This question is relevant
since the coronal magnetic ﬁeld cannot be directly observed and the optically thin coronal emission can easily lead
to misleading loop-like structure, best exempliﬁed by the concept of ‘coronal veil’ introduced by Malanushenko et al.
(2022). Furthermore, a debate exists on whether a coronal loop can be well-deﬁned at all, since global MHD simulations
suggest continuous magnetic connectivity changes and fuzzy boundaries between diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld structures
(Gudiksen & Nordlund 2005). On the other hand, the occurrence of a coronal rain shower points to the TNE-TI
scenario (Antolin 2020), and therefore a speciﬁc thermodynamic evolution that is coherent over a speciﬁc bundle of
magnetic ﬁeld lines. Furthermore, showers can have a signiﬁcant optical thickness in chromospheric and transition
region lines (given the high coronal rain densities and abundance of rain clumps within a shower), thereby reducing
the projection eﬀect.

To answer this question we conducted the ﬁrst statistical investigation on the morphological and thermodynamic
properties of coronal rain showers using IRIS and SDO/AIA spanning chromospheric and transition region temper-
atures. We found showers to be ubiquitous over an active region observed at the East limb over 5.45 hours. We
manually identiﬁed 50 shower events and found their average lengths and widths on the order of 27±11.95 Mm and
2±0.74 Mm, respectively, with little variation across the spanned temperature range. The obtained widths are similar
to the ﬁrst estimates made in Antolin & Rouppe van der Voort (2012) and Antolin et al. (2015) for individual events.
We morphologically compared the showers with the observed coronal loops that host them, seen in the EUV bands,
and found good agreement regarding the widths. The obtained widths are also in agreement with previous EUV and
X-ray observations of loops (Aschwanden & Boerner 2011; Peter et al. 2013) and from 3D MHD simulations (Peter &
Bingert 2012; Chen et al. 2014). The signiﬁcant lengths of showers (estimated to be a third of the entire loop length)
and their ubiquity suggest that these structures can be used to identify coronal loop structures reliably in observations,
and at least those in a TNE state.

The morphological compatibility of our shower analysis with the studied loops in the literature also sheds light on
another puzzle about loops, linked to the observed constant cross-section along their lengths. In agreement with EUV
observations (Aschwanden & Nightingale 2005; L´opez Fuentes et al. 2008a), little average expansion of the shower
cross-section with height was found, further supporting that this eﬀect is not apparent (L´opez Fuentes et al. 2008b).
Although the cross-section of the ﬂux tube may further expand over a wider volume, only a part of it (2 Mm in width)
is subject to TNE, corresponding to a dense cross-section over which the temperature is homogeneous. This is in
agreement with Peter & Bingert (2012) in the sense that it is speciﬁc thermodynamic cross-ﬁeld distribution behind
this eﬀect. On the other hand, we observe strong expansion at low coronal heights. Between 8 and 12 Mm above the
surface the width increases from 1 to 2.4 Mm, leading to an area expansion factor of 5.7, in agreement with previous
individual results Antolin et al. (2015).

We further analysed the thermodynamic evolution of a few coronal structures hosting the showers (selected based on
their relative isolation in the FOV). Using DEM analysis we found global averaged cooling, in agreement with previous
results (Viall & Klimchuk 2012), but particularly evident in these coronal structures. Steady cooling and heating was
found in the hot (log T = 6.3 − 6.5) and cool coronal temperatures (log T = 6 − 6.1), respectively, one hour prior
to the shower events. This timescale matches the expected radiative cooling time for loops at the beginning of the
TNE cycle with average temperature of 3 × 106 K and density of 109 cm−3 (e.g. Eq. 18 in Antolin & Froment 2022).
Stronger variation, particularly at transition region temperatures (log T = 5.6 − 5.9) was found throughout this time,
and also during the shower events. Such increased dynamics are commonly seen in active regions (Ugarte-Urra et al.
2009; Reale 2014) and match well the radiation-dominated coronal loop evolution followed by catastrophic cooling at
the end of the TNE-TI cycles (Antolin et al. 2022).

We have also addressed how much of the coronal volume in an active region is in a state of TNE. The importance
of this question is based on the fact that TNE occurrence is linked to strongly stratiﬁed and high-frequency heating

10

(Klimchuk & Luna 2019), which constitute strong constraints for any heating mechanism. To answer this question
we estimated the total number of showers, ﬁnding an average of 155±40 over all channels. Assumming that a shower
occupies on average 1/3 of a coronal loop, we obtained an estimate for the average TNE volume of 4.56±3.71 ×1028
cm3. Taking the IRIS FOV as a rough estimate of the total AR volume (assuming the same length along the line-
of-sight as the width of the FOV), we obtain a AR volume of 8.7 ×1028 cm3, by approximating the shape of the
AR to a trapezoidal shape covering the observed coronal loops. Our TNE volume estimate is roughly half the AR
volume. This is very likely a lower estimate of the TNE volume because we are not able to detect with IRIS the
loops with TNE cycles without catastrophic cooling (incomplete condensations) for which the temperatures do not
go down to transition region values or lower. Similarly, the probability of detecting loops with TNE cycle periods
longer than the duration of our observing time sequence decreases with the period, and according to Auch`ere et al.
(2014) and Froment (2016), their occurrence frequency remains roughly the same for periods between 6 and 16 hrs
in active regions. Furthermore, we have used strict conditions for coronal rain detection, which ignores all rain with
low emissivity. These results therefore suggest a prevalence of TNE in this AR, indicating strongly stratiﬁed and
high-frequency heating on average.
