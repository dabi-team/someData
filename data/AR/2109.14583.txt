ABSTRACT

This paper studies the magnetic topology of successively erupting active regions (ARs) 11429
and 12371. Employing vector magnetic ﬁeld observations from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager,
the pre-eruptive magnetic structure is reconstructed by a model of non-linear force-free ﬁeld
(NLFFF). For all the ﬁve CMEs from these ARs, the pre-eruptive magnetic structure identiﬁes
an inverse-S sigmoid consistent with the coronal plasma tracers in EUV observations. In all the
eruption cases, the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) of Large Q values are continuously enclosing
core ﬁeld bipolar regions in which inverse-S shaped ﬂare ribbons are observed. These QSLs
essentially represent the large connectivity gradients between the domains of twisted core ﬂux
within the inner bipolar region and the surrounding potential like arcade. It is consistent with the
observed ﬁeld structure largely with the sheared arcade. The QSL maps in the chromosphere
are compared with the ﬂare-ribbons observed at the peak time of the ﬂares. The ﬂare ribbons are
largely inverse-S shape morphology with their continuity of visibility is missing in the observations.
For the CMEs in the AR 12371, the QSLs outline the ﬂare ribbons as a combination of two
inverse J-shape sections with their straight parts being separated. These QSLs are typical with
the weakly twisted ﬂux rope. Similarly, for the CMEs in the AR 11429, the QSLs are co-spatial
with the ﬂare ribbons both in the middle of the PIL and in the hook sections. In the frame work of
standard model of eruptions, the observed ﬂare ribbons are the characteristic of the pre-eruptive
magnetic structure being sigmoid which is reproduced by the NLFFF model with a weakly twisted
ﬂux rope at the core.

1 INTRODUCTION
Most often the coronal mass ejections are seen to launch from magnetically concentrated regions called
active regions (ARs). In soft X-rays or in EUV images, the ARs that precede CMEs are seen with the
observational features of S- and J-shaped loops situated over along the polarity inversion line (PIL). Owing
to this speciﬁc S- or inverted S-shape, Rust and Kumar (1996) termed these regions as sigmoids and are
considered to be one of the most important precursor structures for the solar eruptions (Hudson et al., 1998;
Canﬁeld et al., 1999, 2007).

Magnetic Structure in Successively Erupting Active Regions

The shape of the sigmoid indicates the loops composed of non-potential magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration
characterised by sheared and/or twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines. As a reason, the magnetic structure of
the sigmoids are described by two competing conﬁgurations that are sheared arcade and magnetic ﬂux
rope (MFR). In the sheared arcade model, the two magnetic elbows sheared past each other are situated
at the opposite ends of the PIL with a central sheared core at the middle section of the PIL (Moore
et al., 2001; Moore and Sterling, 2006). And in the MFR scenario, a magnetic MFR is embedded in a
stabilizing potential envelope ﬁeld (Moore and Roumeliotis, 1992; Hood and Priest, 1979; Rust and Kumar,
1996). Because of the non-potential nature of the magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic structure in the sigmoid
is approximated with a non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) which allows different twist parameter for
individual ﬁeld lines. The force-free modeling is justiﬁed by the low-β corona with a slowly evolving ﬁeld
compared to the Alfven crossing time.

To understand the eruptive nature of sigmoidal regions, it is important to study their magnetic structure
and evolution both theoretically and observationally. Observations showed that the magnetic ﬂux ropes
have frequently been associated with sigmoidal regions (Rust and Kumar, 1996; Gibson et al., 2006;
Green et al., 2007; SONG et al., 2015; Vemareddy and Mishra, 2015; Song et al., 2018) and the modelled
NLFFF magnetic conﬁguration that describes the observed shape of sigmoids is a weakly twisted ﬂux rope
embedded in potential arcade (Savcheva et al., 2012b; Zhao et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2013; Vemareddy et al.,
2016; Vemareddy and Dem´oulin, 2018). The ﬂux rope structure constructed from analytical conﬁgurations

(D´emoulin, 2006, 2007) exhibits current sheets in the magnetic interface layers called quasi-separatrix
layers (QSLs) where the connectivity of the ﬁeld lines changes drastically just like separatrix layers. In the
process of emerging, such a MFR develops a separatrix surface touching the photosphere along the PIL
section (Titov and D´emoulin, 1999; Titov et al., 2002). These sections of the PIL are called bald-patches
(BPs) and the separatrix surface at the BP appears as an S-shape from top view similar to sigmoid shape.
After the emergence phase, the S-shaped bald-patch separatrix surface (BPSS) bifurcates into a double
J-shaped QSL with the main body of the MFR lifted off. From this BPSS topology, the QSL structure
underneath the rising ﬂux rope develops an X-line conﬁguration referred to as hyperbolic ﬂux tube (HFT),
where the reconnection sets in for the onset of the eruption. Therefore, the HFT topology is the predicted

site for ﬂare reconnection and CME eruption (Savcheva et al., 2012c). Further, the topological analysis of
the MFR conﬁgurations, both models and observations, recommends the extension of the standard CHSHK
ﬂare model (Carmichael, 1964; Sturrock, 1966; Hirayama, 1974; Kopp and Pneuman, 1976) to 3D. In the
2D ﬂare model two ﬂare ribbons are observed on either side of the PIL, whereas MFR eruptions found
co-spatial ﬂare ribbons with hook-shaped QSLs (Pariat and D´emoulin, 2012; Janvier et al., 2013; Janvier
et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016). Figure 1 displays the schematic of the 3D standard model for eruptive ﬂares
as interpreted from simulations of eruptive MFRs (Titov and D´emoulin, 1999; Pariat and D´emoulin, 2012;
Chen et al., 2012). In the left panel, the hook-shape inverse-S shaped QSLs in the photosphere are shown
in thick black curves. The HFT underneath the uplifting MFR is depicted in the right panel as seen from
perspective view. The photospheric QSL footpoints are co-spatial with ﬂare ribbons in the 3D-eruptive
ﬂare models which is a signature of the MFR topology.

Motivated by the above topological studies of the erupting regions, in this paper, we study the pre-eruptive
magnetic structure of ﬁve CMEs from two successively erupting ARs. The coronal ﬁeld is constructed
by NLFFF (Wiegelmann, 2004), then we computed the chromospheric QSLs to compare their spatial
locations with the geometry of the observed ﬂare ribbons. By this comparison, one can ascertain the
model predictions of the topological features with the observations, and then also validate the extent of
the invoked NLFFF model to reproduce the actual coronal ﬁeld. The paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, an overview of the CME events with a brief description of results presented in the previous reports.
Reconstruction of the magnetic structure by NLFFF modeling is presented in Section 3. Comparison of the
QSLs with the ﬂare-ribbons is made in Section 4 and concluded with a summarized discussion in Section 5.

2 OVERVIEW OF THE OBSERVATIONS
Observations of the successive eruptions from the ARs 11429 and 12371 are obtained from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012)
on board NASA’s space-based Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The AIA instrument captures the full
disc images of the solar corona in 10 wavelengths at 0.6 arcsec pixel−1 resolution. The HMI provides
photospheric line of sight and vector magnetic ﬁeld observations at 0.5 arcsec pixel−1 resolution in Fe I
6173 ˚A wavelength. The pipeline procedures of deriving the vector magnetic ﬁelds from the Stokes ﬁlter
images are documented in Bobra et al. (2014) and Hoeksema et al. (2014). We used vector magnetic ﬁeld
data product hmi.sharp cea 720s at a cadence of 720s. Additional information of the CME eruptions
is obtained from web portals like CME catalog1, and solar monitor2.

The AR 11429 was a pre-emerged one probably on far-side of the sun. Figure 2 demonstrates the eruption
scenario in this AR 11429. In panel 2a. the full disk image of AIA 131 ˚A shows the structured coronal
emission from the AR 11429 (yellow rectangular box) located in the north (N17◦) hemisphere. HMI
observations of the photospheric vector magnetograms at the pre-eruption time on two different days are
displayed in panels 2(b-c). The AR presents a large interface opposite polarities known as polarity inversion
line (PIL). These magnetic polarities evolve with persistent shearing and converging motions which led to
continuous ﬂux cancellation as observed with the decay of the magnetic ﬂux regions. Such regions are
favorable to form stored energy conﬁgurations of sheared magnetic ﬁelds along the PIL. As a result, the
AR evolved to a much more complex magnetic conﬁguration (β/γ/δ) producing severe ﬂare/CME activity
during its disk transit. In Panel 2(c), GOES X-ray ﬂux (1-8 ˚A band) displays the peaks of one X and two
M-class ﬂares associated with the CME eruptions from the AR 11429. Because of recurrent eruptions

from the same region under a continuous physical process, these eruptions are referred to as homologous
eruptions (Nitta and Hudson, 2001; Zhang and Wang, 2002). Study of this AR by Dhakal et al. (2020)
suggests that the shearing motion and magnetic ﬂux cancellation by converging ﬂuxes were key processes
to recurrently form the erupting structure and then its eruption. Details of the CME eruptions from this AR
are listed in Table 1.

Another recurrent CME producing AR was NOAA 12371, which was also a pre-emerged region that
passes the visible solar disk 12◦N on June 16, 2015. Figure 3 presents the eruption scenario of this

AR. A representative AIA 131 ˚A full disk image is displayed in panel 3a, which shows the sigmoidal
morphology of AR corona (yellow rectangular box). Panels 3(b-c) display the HMI vector magnetograms
at the pre-eruption time on June 21 and 22. The AR essentially consists of a leading negative ﬂux region
with the following interacting opposite polarity regions. From these magnetic ﬁeld observations, the AR’s
disk passage reveals that the following bipolar region was seen with large shear and converging motion
as a result the ﬂux distribution becomes diffused and disintegrated in successive days. As in the earlier
AR, such an evolution of magnetic polarities leads to formation of the twisted ﬂux along the PIL, which
indeed is revealed by the sigmoidal loop structure in the EUV images. Four major CME eruptions occurred
associated with M-class ﬂares from this AR as shown by the peaks in the GOES X-ray ﬂux plot of panel 3c.
A detailed study of this AR by Vemareddy (2017) interprets the successive eruptions by the cyclic process
of energy and helicity storage over a time scale of a day or two and then its release by the CME eruptions.
Table 1 lists the CME eruptions and associated ﬂares from this AR.

3 MODELLED MAGNETIC STRUCTURE: NON-LINEAR FORCE-FREE FIELD
The AR magnetic structure in 3D is modelled by applying the NLFFF extrapolation (Wheatland et al.,
2000; Wiegelmann, 2004; Wiegelmann and Inhester, 2010). The NLFFF algorithm involves minimization
of the functional

In the above equation, the ﬁrst integral includes quadratic forms of the force-free and solenoidal conditions
and w is a weighting function toward the lateral and top boundaries. Second term is surface integral to
take into account measurement errors and allows a slow injection of the boundary data controlled by the
Lagrangian multiplier ν (see, Wiegelmann and Inhester 2010 for more details). W (x, y) is a diagonal
matrix, which is chosen inversely proportional to the transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength.

The observed photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld from the HMI is used as the lower boundary condition,
for which the ﬁeld has to satisfy ﬂux balance, force-free conditions. When the vector magnetic ﬁeld has
full coverage of the AR, the ﬂux balance condition is normally satisﬁed within 10% deviation. To keep
this value as small as possible, we multiply the positive polarity region with a relative ﬂux factor deﬁned

observations are inserted in an extended ﬁeld of view and then rebinned to 1 arcsec pixel−1. With the
normal ﬁeld component of magnetic ﬁeld, we reconstructed the 3D potential ﬁeld (PF) which is then used
as the initial condition and also to prescribe the top and side boundaries for the NLFFF algorithm.

In Figure 4, we show the NLFFF magnetic structure of AR 11429 just before the CME events on March 6,
9 and 10. The NLFFF is constructed on a grid of of 450 × 450 × 201 representing the physical dimensions
of 328 × 328 × 146 Mm3 AR corona. Similarly in Figures 5, we show the NLFFF magnetic structure of
AR 12371 just before the CME events on June 21 and 22. In this case, the NLFFF ﬁeld is constructed on a
grid of of 512 × 512 × 256 representing the physical dimensions of 373 × 373 × 186 Mm3 AR corona. For
all of the cases, the NLFFF relaxation converges to an average ﬁeld divergence of the order 10−4 and an
average ﬁeld-aligned current deﬁned by θJ to an extent 9-12◦.

To capture the most sheared structure, the ﬁeld lines are rendered according to total current density
(|J|) and horizontal ﬁeld component (Bh) at the bottom boundary. The ﬁeld line rendering is shown in
perspective and top views in 1st and 2nd rows respectively of Figures 4 and 5. In these panels, the bottom
plane is an observed Bz map. The ﬁeld rendering in these panels comprise two inverse J-shaped ﬁeld lines
sheared past each other about the main PIL, which together reveal the shape of the inverse S-sigmoid.
Owing to shearing motions of the foot points, the ﬁeld lines near PIL are strongly stressed, manifesting
low lying twisted core of the sigmoid, which is regarded as ﬂux rope with helical ﬁeld lines. During the
onset of the eruption, this ﬂux rope builds up further by the reconnection of oppositely sheared ﬁeld, and
therefore is the central structure of the solar eruptions (Moore et al., 2001; Duan et al., 2019).

In order to judge the NLFFF model to the coronal magnetic ﬁeld, the modeled magnetic structure is
compared to EUV coronal observations. To this end, we ensure that the EUV images are co-aligned to
the magnetic ﬁeld with the same ﬁeld-of-view. The same ﬁeld line rendering is over-plotted on EUV
observations of corona captured in AIA 171 ˚A images(second row panels) which delineates a good global
resemblance of the ﬁeld lines with the plasma tracers. Because of the strong volume currents, the intense
hot emission in AIA 94 ˚A images is mostly co-spatial with the NLFFF twisted core along the PIL.

4 QUASI-SEPARATRIX LAYERS AND FLARE RIBBONS
QSLs are the regions of the magnetic volume where the ﬁeld line connectivity experiences dramatic but
continuous variations, including possible discontinuities in the mapping, so are the generalized features to
the separatrices (Demoulin et al., 1996). From the constructed 3D coronal ﬁelds, the change in magnetic
ﬁeld line linkage in the volume is measured by the strength of QSLs which is deﬁned by squashing factor
Q (Titov et al., 2002; Titov, 2007). Q describes the gradients in the ﬁeld line mapping whose larger values
correspond to the cross section of QSLs in any plane. It is computed by tracing two consecutive ﬁeld lines
with foot points at an extremely small distance and then measuring the distance between the respective
conjugate foot points as given by the following mathematical expression

1 < Log(Q) < 7. QSLs of large Q-values separate the sheared/twisted core ﬁeld from the surrounding
less sheared ﬁeld in the following bipolar region. Also higher Q-values in quiet regions are due to noisy
transverse ﬁeld and have no relevance to the magnetic structure of interest. Second and third rows: Co-

the ﬂare ribbons including the hooked shape.

The complexity in the QSL maps of the NLFFF model is intrinsic to the large amount of fragmentation in
the observed photospheric magnetic-ﬁeld distribution. It has been shown that the complexity of QSL maps
decreases with the height (Savcheva et al., 2012b,c). This is a consequence of the magnetic ﬁeld being
progressively smoother with height. Therefore, to determine important QSLs, Q maps are computed at 1.5
Mm height above the photosphere, which we refer chromospheric QSLs in this manuscript discussion.

In the ﬁrst row panels of Figures 6 and 7, we plot log Q maps at z = 1.5 M m with inverse sign, so the
darker parts correspond to higher Q values. For a reference, Bz contours of ±120G are over-plotted. Due
to noisy transverse ﬁeld, the Q maps of NLFFF are more fragmented in weak ﬁeld regions. The relevant
QSLs are having large Q values (> 107) located in the stronger magnetic polarities related to the sigmoid

QSLs of large Q-values separate the sheared/twisted core ﬁeld from the surrounding less sheared ﬁeld

of Q, this overall QSL is continuous and encloses an inverse S-shaped region ﬁlled with lower Q-values.
Essentially, these QSL highlights the difference between the twisted core ﬂux within the region and the
surrounding potential like arcade outside.

This picture is even clearer in the vertical cross-section map of Q obtained across the sigmoid. These
are shown in Figures 8 and 9. Bz-contours (±80G, red for positive, blue for negative), obtained in the
same cut-plane, are over-plotted. Different from horizontal maps, the vertical Q maps are smooth with an
obvious relevance with the magnetic polarities about the PIL. In these maps, the QSLs of large Q values
well distinguish two closed domains belonging to largely sheared sections on either side of the PIL and the
surrounding potential like arcade. Importantly the QSLs intersect the magnetic polarities at the middle in
the NLFFF, whereas they cover the entire polarity region in the PF. This is clearly an indication of a sheared
core being surrounded by less-sheared/potential arcade in the AR. Given the twisted ﬂux (ﬂux rope) at the
core, the QSLs in its cross section mimics a inverse tear-drop shape as predicted by the theoretical models
quoted in the Introduction. Depending on the degree of the twist, the identiﬁcation of such QSLs varies due
to observational and modeling difﬁculties (see for example Figure 8 in Vemareddy 2019 and Figure 4 in
Zhao et al. 2016). In our NLFFF structures of the ﬁve CMEs, it is mildly visible as shown in Figure 8 and
9.

For a comparison with ﬂare ribbons, the corresponding AIA 304 ˚A 1600 ˚Aobservations are displayed
in the second and third row panels of Figures 6 and 7 respectively. On these maps, contours of Q for
the corresponding event at 105, 106 levels are over-plotted in cyan-color. Note that we are comparing
pre-eruptive Q-maps with the ribbons at around peak time of the ﬂare of each eruption. Owing to noisy
transverse ﬁeld, and the discontinuous ﬁeld distribution, the Q maps have patchy structure and we further
apply a small threshold |Bz| < 15 G to remove non-relevant QSLs. In addition, irrelevant QSLs are
removed by applying a mask on the computed Q-maps.

The correspondence between the photospheric QSLs and ﬂare ribbons has been shown in several studies.
Theoretical studies predict that the ﬂare ribbons are the photospheric foot prints of QSLs that encloses a
twisted MFR (Demoulin et al., 1996; Janvier et al., 2015). The extremities of the ribbons are hook shaped
for weakly twisted MFRs and are spiral shaped for highly twisted MFRs, as depicted in the cartoon of
the 3D-model for eruptive ﬂares in Figure 1. Moreover, the characteristic 3D shape of QSLs associated
with a twisted MFR depends on the height of the horizontal cut plane (Titov, 2007; Savcheva et al., 2012c;
Savcheva et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016). The QSL is S-shaped if the horizontal cut plane is at HFT and the
cut planes lies below HFT, the QSL will appear as 2 (inverse) J-shaped with straight parts of J parallel to
each other along the PIL. From this point of view of the MFR topology, the panels in Figure 6 for the CME
events from AR 11429, the QSLs are broadly spread over the ﬂare ribbons especially the hook sections of
the QSLs are in good morphological agreement. Such a remarkable match is an indication of the NLFFF
models being capable of capturing hooked shape QSLs co-spatial with the observed ﬂare ribbons, and was
ﬁrst reported by Zhao et al. (2016) in the topological analysis of AR 12158 employing the Grad-Rubin
based NLFFF model.

From the above described MFR topology, the QSLs in the AR 12371 are also qualitatively match with the
observed ﬂare ribbons. The inverse-S ribbon exactly falls in the region outlined by QSLs of large Q-values.
In fact, these QSLs can be regarded as a combination of 2 inverse-J shaped with a signiﬁcant separation
distance between the straight parts along PIL. We interpret the observed shape of the QSLs in the AR 12371
due to large part of sheared arcade surrounding the PIL, embedding the small-scale MFR. The sheared
arcade becomes a large-scale twisted MFR only during onset of eruption by tether-cutting reconnection.
The process of sheared arcade becoming large scale MFR is a dynamic process and may not be captured in

vector magnetograms. Therefore, the static extrapolation results in a conﬁguration with QSLs outlining
the sheared arcade. Then the QSLs represents the boundaries of two connectivity domains separating the
sheared arcade and the surrounding potential arcade.

Another factor that could also contribute to capture the observed shape of QSL is the amount of twist in
the magnetic conﬁguration (Pariat and D´emoulin, 2012; Savcheva et al., 2012b). A more twisted MFR will
present a more pronounced hook such that the it appears as spiral in shape. In our cases, the separation
distance between the straight parts of QSL J-sections and their hook shape are very likely due to insufﬁcient
or weak twist. Moreover, the twist of these ﬁeld lines increases as a consequence of the eruption. Meeting
this twist criteria, in particular during the dynamic phase of the eruption, the QSL foot prints would be
co-spatial precisely with the observed ﬂare ribbons.

Magnetic Structure in Successively Erupting Active Regions

5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Topological study of magnetic connectivity gradients provides more insights on the relation of magnetic
structure of the sigmoid and ﬂare ribbons in the frame work of standard model of eruptions. We studied the
pre-eruptive magnetic structure of ﬁve CMEs launched from two successively erupting ARs. The modelled
magnetic structure is largely resembles an inverse-S sigmoid in good agreement with the coronal plasma
tracers in EUV observations. In all the eruption cases, the QSLs of large Q values are continuous enclosing
core ﬁeld bipolar region in which inverse-S shaped ﬂare ribbon is observed. These QSLs essentially
represent the large connectivity gradients between the domains of twisted core ﬂux within the inner bipolar
region and the surrounding potential like arcade outside. It is consistent with the observed ﬁeld structure
largely with the sheared arcade.

The QSL maps in the chromosphere are compared with the ﬂare ribbons observed at the peak time of the
ﬂares. The ﬂare ribbons are largely with inverse-S shape morphology with their continuity of visibility
is missing in the observations. For the CMEs in the AR 12371, the QSLs outline the ﬂare ribbons as a
combination of two inverse J-shape sections but their straight sections being separated at the middle of the
PIL. These QSLs are typically associated with the weakly twisted ﬂux rope topology. Similarly, for the
CMEs in the AR 11429, the QSLs are co-spatial with the ﬂare ribbons both in the middle of the PIL and
in the hook sections. This overall match of the observed ﬂare ribbons with the photospheric QSLs is an
indication that the NLFFF model of optimization approach reproduces the pre-eruptive magnetic structure
to a very good extent. Earlier Grad-Rubin implementation of NLFFF model was reported to capture the
hook shaped QSLs co-spatial with the ﬂare ribbons (Zhao et al., 2016).

However, we can notice that the co-spatiality is not precise to the predicted extent in the theoretical models
of the MFRs. In the tether-cutting scenario, the MFR forms only during eruption dynamically at which time
we expect hook shaped, two inverse-J sections of QSLs that are co-spatial with the observed ﬂare ribbons
(Savcheva et al., 2012a; Janvier et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016). As per the view that the sheared arcades are
weakly twisted MFRs in the sense that the magnetic ﬁeld is dominated by the axial component (Mackay
et al., 2010), we can regard the observed QSL shape in the AR 12371 as the combination of two inverse-J
sections with signiﬁcant separation distance between the straight parts along the PIL. Therefore, the QSLs
outlining the ﬂare ribbons in the AR 12371 and less compact QSL hooks in the AR 11429 are likely due to
the weakly twisted ﬂux rope system. Additionally, difﬁculties related to input observations, construction
of actual magnetic structure with the NLFFF modeling could also contribute to this discrepancy in the
expected inverse-S (or two J-shaped ones) QSLs exactly co-spatial with the observed ﬂare ribbons.
