Spin-orbit splitting is an essential ingredient for our understanding of the shell structure in nuclei.
One of the most important advantages of relativistic mean-ﬁeld (RMF) models in nuclear physics
is the fact that the large spin-orbit (SO) potential emerges automatically from the inclusion of
Lorentz-scalar and -vector potentials in the Dirac equation. It is therefore of great importance to
compare the results of such models with experimental data. We investigate the size of 2p- and 1f
splittings for the isotone chain 40Ca, 38Ar, 36S, and 34Si in the framework of various relativistic and
nonrelativistic density functionals. They are compared with the results of nonrelativistic models
and with recent experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

Self-consistent mean-ﬁeld models in the framework of
nuclear density functional theory provide a very success-
ful way to study nuclear structure phenomena through-
out the entire nuclear chart. The nucleons are treated
as independent particles moving inside the nucleus un-
der the inﬂuence of various potentials, derived from such
functionals [1]. These methods are similar to those used
in electronic systems where the form of the density func-
tionals can be deduced ab initio from the well-known
Coulomb force between the electrons [2, 3]. Contrary
to that, at present, the nuclear density functionals are
constructed phenomenologically. The form of those func-
tionals is motivated by the symmetries of the underlying
basic theories. The parameters of the model, however,
are adjusted to experimental data in ﬁnite nuclei.

Within the concept of density functional theory, the
full quantum-mechanical nuclear many-body problem is
mapped onto a single-particle problem, assuming that
the exact ground-state of the A-body system is deter-
mined by a Slater determinant and the corresponding
single-particle density matrix generated from the prod-
ucts of A single-particle states. By imposing a variation
principle on the energy functional with respect to this
density one derives the equations of motion of the in-
dependently moving nucleons. The speciﬁc form of the
phenomenological density functional leads to a certain
form of the mean-ﬁeld.

There are two general versions of this theory. The
standard since almost ﬁfty years ago, are nonrelativis-
tic functionals. The most widely known forms are the
Skyrme-type functionals, based on zero-range interac-
tions [4] and the Gogny-type functionals of ﬁnite-range

∗kokaraka@auth.gr

interactions [5]. Later on, covariant density functionals
were introduced. Their relativistic form is based on the
simple model of Walecka [6, 7] and its density dependence
was introduced by nonlinear meson couplings by Boguta
and Bodmer [8].

Both relativistic and nonrelativistic models have been
very successful in describing bulk and structure proper-
ties of nuclei all along the beta stability line giving very
similar results. However, going to nuclei close to the
drip line with high isospin values there were signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in measuring special quantities. A character-
istic case has been the failure of the standard Skyrme
functionals used at the time, to reproduce the observed
kink in the radii diﬀerence of the chain of Pb isotopes,
whereas relativistic functionals were very successful at
reproducing it [9]. It was afterwards recognised that this
qualitatively distinct result was due to the diﬀerent way
the two methods treat the spin-orbit interaction. In the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) models the large spin-orbit
in nuclei, which is known since the early days of the
shell model [10, 11], is included phenomenologically in
the form of the functional with an additional parameter
that has to be adjusted to the experimental data.
In
contrast the covariant treatment gives rise to the very
large spin-orbit coupling in a natural way. It has its ori-
gin in the fact, that the nuclear Dirac equation contains
a very large attractive scalar ﬁeld and a very large re-
pulsive vector ﬁeld. For the normal potential these two
ﬁelds compensate to a large extent, but their eﬀects add
up in the spin-orbit term [12, 13].

In all the conventional nonrelativistic models the spin-
orbit term is derived from a two-body spin-orbit interac-
tion of zero range [4, 5, 14]. The corresponding Fock term
leads to a strong isospin dependence of the spin-orbit
splitting. This is the origin of the failure to reproduce the
kink in the isotopic shifts mentioned above. In covariant
models the spin-orbit splitting is a single-particle eﬀect,
derived directly from the Dirac equation. Its isospin de-

 
 
 
 
 
 
pendence is given by the ρ meson. Its strength is deter-
mined by the symmetry energy and it leads usually only
to a weak isospin dependence [6, 12]. The use of an addi-
tional scalar isovector δ meson does not change very much
this situation, because the contributions of the isovector
mesons to the spin-orbit term are small as compared with
the contributions of the isoscalar mesons [15].

Of course the strong isospin dependence of the spin-
orbit term in conventional nonrelativistic density func-
tionals introduced by the Fock term can be avoided, if
the assumption is given up that the density functional is
derived as the expectation value of an eﬀective Hamilto-
nian which leads inevitably to exchange terms. There-
fore, subsequent eﬀorts to correct for this result have
led to modiﬁed Skyrme schemes where the strength of
the Fock term in the functional is used as a ﬁt param-
eter [16, 17].
In this way an extension of the Skyrme
functional was proposed [17], reproducing also the evo-
lution of the nuclear radius with neutron number N for
the isotope series of Pb and Ca. The resulting functionals
were able to correct for the initial failure by changing the
density dependence of the neutron spin-orbit potential.
Another example for the diﬀerences of the models in
the spin-orbit part was observed in Ref. [18]. It was found
out, that in the framework of relativistic mean-ﬁeld the-
ory, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the spin-orbit
potential in light drip line nuclei that have a large isospin
value. This had an eﬀect on the energy splittings of the
same spin-orbit partners which were reduced for isotopes
of Ne and Mg with the increase of neutron number. Again
it was shown that a modiﬁcation of the spin-orbit term in
Skyrme has results similar with those of the relativistic
mean-ﬁeld.

There has been lately a renewed interest in experimen-
tal studies concerning the spin-orbit part of the nuclear
force. In particular, two speciﬁc experiments [19, 20] were
recently published, where the structure of the N = 20 nu-
cleus 34Si nucleus is investigated. The reason why this
particular nucleus was chosen is its unique bubble struc-
ture, unveiled in earlier theoretical calculations [21] using
both relativistic and nonrelativistic models. This bubble
structure implies that there is a large central depletion
in the proton density, which is due to the fact that the
2s1/2 proton state is essentially empty. This is exactly
what it was shown this time experimentally in the very
recent study by Mutschler et al.
[20], where they used
the one proton removal (
1p) method, to probe the in-
terior of the 34Si nucleus and to show that the 2s1/2 is
indeed empty.

−

Following, therefore, the identiﬁcation of 34Si as a bub-
ble nucleus [21] a very speciﬁc experiment by Burgunder
et al. [19] was conducted to attempt to set an additional
constraint on the strength of the spin-orbit force. Com-
paring these results with earlier experiments on nuclei
within the N = 20 isotone chain, such as in Refs. [22, 23],
2p1/2
one was able to evaluate a reduction in the 2p3/2 −
splitting. This eﬀect has been attributed to the occur-
rence of a bubble in the central proton density as one

advances from 36S to 34Si. This is analogous to the
case discussed in Ref.
[18] where the addition of neu-
trons in Ni and Sn isotopes, leads to the weakening of
the spin-orbit potential and to a subsequent reduction of
the size of the spin-orbit splitting of the neutron subsys-
tem. Therefore, it has been suggested, that this kind of
speciﬁc measurement could work complementary to the
aforementioned theoretical studies, in order to investigate
further the spin-orbit force in various mean-ﬁeld models.
There has already been a study within the nonrela-
tivistic mean-ﬁeld approach [24] where the 2p and 1f
neutron spin-orbit splittings in the N = 20 isotones 40Ca,
36S and 34Si have been analyzed for various Skyrme and
Gogny functionals. Inspired by this work, we carried out
an investigation within self-consistent covariant density
functional theory describing the same nuclei as well as
38Ar. Concentrating on the ﬁrst 1f7/2, 2p3/2, 2p1/2, and
1f5/2 neutron states, we calculated the SO splittings of
the 2p and 1f orbitals and compared them with the cor-
responding nonrelativistic and experimental results. Our
goal is to examine whether the diﬀerent treatments of the
spin-orbit force in relativistic and nonrelativistic mean-
ﬁeld models gives rise to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results,
as it has been the case for the investigations mentioned
above [9, 17, 18]

We ﬁrst neglect pairing correlations, as it has been
done in the earlier nonrelativistic work of Ref. [24] and
calculate the single-particle energies in the relativistic
Hartree model (RH) based on several modern nonlin-
ear and density-dependent covariant density functionals.
Afterwards we go beyond these investigations in vari-
ous aspects: we study the inﬂuence of pairing correla-
tions within the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (RHB)
scheme, we include tensor forces in relativistic Hartree-
Fock (RHF) theory, and ﬁnally we go beyond mean-ﬁeld
and include particle-vibration coupling (PVC).

Our article is organized in the following way: In Sec. II
we present the theoretical methods and in Sec. III we
introduce speciﬁc extensions. Section IV is devoted to
numerical details of the calculations and in Sec. V we
discuss the results of our investigations. Section VI con-
tains conclusions and an outlook for future work.

II. THEORY

As described in Ref. [25] in the relativistic case nu-
cleons are treated as four-component Dirac spinors and
the interaction is mediated by the exchange of virtual
mesons. The minimal set of meson ﬁelds required to de-
scribe bulk and single-particle nuclear properties have the
following quantum numbers and properties:

(i) σ meson: J π, T = 0+, 0, medium range attraction

(ii) ω meson: J π, T = 1−, 0, short range repulsion

(iii) ρ meson: J π, T = 1−, 1, isospin channel.

Inspired by ab initio calculations [26] one has introduced
in some models in addition an isovector scalar meson, the
δ meson [15]:

(iv) δ meson: J π, T = 0+, 1, isospin channel.

Later on one has also introduced nonlinear couplings in
the ω- and ρ-sector. As examples for such functionals
we use in this investigation the parameter set NL3 [27],
NL3∗ [28], and FSUGold [29].

Through the classical variation of the Lagrangian with
respect to the diﬀerent ﬁelds we ﬁnd the equations of
motion, the Dirac equation for the spinors and Klein-
Gordon equations for the mesons. In the static case with
time-reversal invariance have

(α · p + β(M + S) + V )ψi = εiψi,

where the relativistic scalar and vector ﬁelds S and V are
given by

and in a similar way we have the density for protons and
neutrons ρn and ρp. The summation runs always over the
occupied states in the Fermi sea (no-sea approximation).
More modern functionals describe the density depen-
dence not by nonlinear meson couplings, but rather by
density-dependent coupling constants: gi(ρ) (for i =
σ, δ, ω, ρ).
Instead of following the approach with non-
linear terms, an idea to use density-dependent couplings
was ﬁrst proposed by Brockman and Toki [30], who de-
rived the density dependence from relativistic Brueckner-
Hartree-Fock calculations in nuclear matter at various
densities. Modern high precision functionals use various
phenomenological forms for the density dependence, such
as, for instance, the so-called Typel-Wolter ansatz [31]:

gi(ρ) = gi(ρsat)fi(x)
gi(ρ) = gi(ρsat) exp[

for i = σ, ω, (15)
for i = δ, ρ, (16)

with

fi(x) = ai

1 + bi(x + di)2
1 + ci(x + di)2

(17)

being a function of x = ρ/ρsat, where ρsat is the density
at saturation of symmetric nuclear matter. The Typel-
Wolter ansatz is used for the density functionals DD-
ME2 [32] and DD-MEδ [15].

Meson exchange forces with ﬁnite meson masses are
relatively complicated,
in particular for triaxially de-
formed nuclei or for applications of time-dependent den-
sity functional theory for the description of excited states.

Therefore, in analogy with the nonrelativistic Skyrme
functional, one has introduced forces with zero range,
the so-called point-coupling models [33]. These are gen-
eralizations of the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model [34] in-
cluding derivative terms and density-dependent coupling
constants. In this investigation we use the point-coupling
functionals PC-F1 [35] with a polynomial density depen-
dence and the point-coupling functional DD-PC1 [36, 37]
with an exponential ansatz for the density dependence.

A.

Isospin dependence of the spin-orbit force

As noted in Refs.

[12, 13], the spin-orbit coupling
arises naturally in the relativistic formalism from the ad-
dition of the two large ﬁelds, the vector ﬁeld V produced
mainly by the short-range repulsion of the ω meson, and
the scalar ﬁeld S produced mainly by the attractive σ
mesons. The isovector mesons δ and ρ contribute to the
isovector dependence of the spin-orbit splitting [15].

In the nonrelativistic expansion of the Dirac equa-

tion [38] the spin-orbit term obtains the form

To have a rough estimate for the isospin dependence we
make the following approximations: (i) we neglect non-
linear meson couplings as well as the density dependence
of the coupling constants, (ii) we neglect the diﬀerence
between scalar and vector density, and (iii) we solve the
Klein-Gordon equations in the local density approxima-
tion, i.e., we neglect the Laplacians.

We thus obtain for the meson-coupling models with

ρn), (22)

Wτ = W1∇ρτ + W2∇ρτ ′6=τ ,

(23)

with W1 very close to W2:

Of course, there is also a small isospin-dependence in
the eﬀective mass ˜M and, because of the density depen-
dence, these parameters depend on r. However, in the
relevant region, for all the models, the isovector coupling
constants Cρ + Cδ reach only 10%-20% of the isoscalar
values.

In principle the ﬁt to experimental data in ﬁnite nuclei
Cδ and not Cρ and Cδ
only allows us to determine Cρ −
independently [15]. Therefore the δ meson is neglected
in most of the successful parameter sets (Cδ = 0).
In
principle Cρ + Cδ could have a large value, as it happens
in the isoscalar case with the extremely large scalar and
vector potentials S and V , which cancel in the normal
mean ﬁeld, but add up in the spin-orbit term. There
are, however, strong indications from ab initio calcula-
tions that this is not the case. In fact, in the parameter
set DD-MEδ [15] the coupling gδ(ρ) was adjusted to the
splitting of the eﬀective Dirac mass between protons and
neutrons, as has been calculated in relativistic Brueckner-
Hartree-Fock calculations in nuclear matter by the Tue-
bingen group [26].

In the nonrelativistic density functionals of Skyrme
and Gogny type the spin-orbit term is derived from a
zero-range two-body spin-orbit interaction of the form

parameter W0, together with the remaining parameters,
is determined phenomenologically through a ﬁt to ﬁnite
nuclei. Since these are Hartree-Fock calculations, the
exchange term leads to a very speciﬁc isospin dependence
and the spin-orbit term has the form of Eq. (18) with
Wτ (r) = W1∇ρτ + W2∇ρτ ′6=τ .

As we see in this standard formulation of nonrelativistic
forces, there is no explicit isospin or density dependence
in the spin-orbit term, but the exchange part of the force
introduces a strong isospin dependence because of the
isospin exchange operator ˆP τ = 1
ˆτ2) . It has
been found that this particular property of the SO term
leads to considerable problems in reproducing the iso-
tope shifts in nuclear charge radii in the Pb region (see
Refs. [9, 17]), which is not the case for the relativistic
models. Of course, density functional theory does not
necessarily have to start with a Hamiltonian treated in
In principle one can
the Hartree-Fock approximation.
also use general density functionals, where the exchange
contribution contains a free parameter xW. In this case
the density functional, i.e., the expectation value of the
energy, is determined in the Hartree-approximation from
a slightly modiﬁed spin-orbit term [17, 39]

When the single-particle ﬁeld is derived from this func-
tional we end up with a spin-orbit potential of the form
(26) with W1 = W0(1 + xw)/2, W2 = W0/2. Using
the modiﬁed Skyrme ansatz there is the ability to allow
for change in the isospin-dependence of Skyrme forces
through the parameter xw [17, 39]. With this kind of
modiﬁcation one was able to reproduce the kink isotopic
shifts of Pb nuclei.

B. Pairing correlations

The theory we have presented above remains in the
relativistic mean-ﬁeld level and since we neglect any ex-
change terms we have a relativistic Hartree approxima-
tion to describe the long-range particle-hole correlations
in a nucleus. However, in open-shell nuclei we know
that particle-particle correlations are important and one
should have to take them into account explicitly. In the
nonrelativistic functionals this is done in the Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory [40, 41] that provides a
uniﬁed picture for the mean-ﬁeld and pairing correla-
tions. The relativistic version of the transformation is
a hybrid where the long-range interaction is given by the
Lorenz-covariant Lagrangians, we have given above, and
the short-range interaction is produced by eﬀective non-
relativistic forces. Pairing correlations can be easily in-
cluded in the framework of density functional theory, by
of the Hartree-
using a generalized Slater determinant
Bogoliubov type. The ground state of a nucleus
is
represented as the vacuum with respect to independent
quasiparticle operators

The chemical potential λ is determined by the particle
number subsidiary condition in order that the expecta-
tion value of the particle number operator in the ground
state equals the number of nucleons. The column vec-
tors denote the quasiparticle wave functions, and Ek are
the quasiparticle energies. The dimension of the RHB
matrix equation is two times the dimension of the corre-
sponding Dirac equation. For each eigenvector (Uk, Vk)
with positive quasiparticle energy Ek > 0, there exists
an eigenvector (V ∗

Since the baryon quasiparticle operators satisfy fermion
commutation relations, the levels Ek and

be occupied simultaneously. For the solution that corre-
sponds to a ground state of a nucleus with even particle
number, one usually chooses the eigenvectors with posi-
tive eigenvalues Ek.

If the pairing ﬁeld ˆ∆ is diagonal and constant, HFB
reduces to the BCS-approximation. The lower and up-
per components Uk(r) and Vk(r) are equivalent, with the

BCS-occupation amplitudes uk and vk as proportionality
constants. In that case we use the odd-even mass diﬀer-
ence to obtain the value of experimental gap parameter

∆ =

(38)

and the occupation probabilities are given by the BCS
formula (37).

The problem with this simpliﬁed method is the ultra-
violet divergence of the pairing ﬁeld for high momenta.
This means that it is necessary to have a ﬁxed pairing
window or an energy cut-oﬀ, which adds an extra param-
eter in the model that cannot be ﬁxed experimentally.

This can be avoided for ﬁnite range eﬀective pairing
forces. One way suggested in Ref. [43] is using a nonrel-
ativistic pairing interaction based on the pairing part of
the well known and very successful Gogny force [44],

V pp(1, 2) =

e−((r1−r2)/µi

with the set D1S [44] for the parameters µi, Wi, Bi, Hi,
and Mi (i = 1, 2). This force has been very carefully
adjusted to the pairing properties of ﬁnite nuclei all over
the periodic table. In particular, the basic advantage of
the Gogny force is the ﬁnite range, which automatically
guarantees a proper cut-oﬀ in momentum space.

This method has been very successful but it requires
great computational eﬀort. So an alternative was devel-
oped in Ref. [45] by Tian et al. (TMR), that has been for-
mulated as a separable force in momentum space. There-
fore it can be determined by two parameters adjusted to
reproduce the pairing gap of the Gogny force in symmet-
ric nuclear matter. In the 1S0 channel the gap equation

The two parameters determining the force are, the pair-

p(k) = e−α
. Their value has been adjusted to G = 728
MeV fm3 and α = 0.644 fm in order to reproduce the
density dependence of the gap at the Fermi surface,
calculated with the D1S parametrization of the Gogny
force [46].

III. SPECIFIC EXTENSIONS

A. Tensor forces

It is generally acknowledged that the tensor part of the
nuclear force plays an essential role in the description of

6

the several nuclear properties. The standard formulation
of covariant density functionals is based on the Relativis-
tic Hartree approximation, i.e., exchange terms are not
taken into account explicitly. This is in most cases a
good approximation, because the coupling constants in
the various spin-isospin channels are adjusted to exper-
imental data. For zero-range forces the Fierz theorem
shows, that exchange terms can be expanded over direct
terms with new eﬀective coupling constants being linear
combinations of the old coupling constants in the dif-
ferent spin-isospin channels. For meson-exchange forces
with heavy meson masses, such as the σ-, ω-, δ- and ρ
mesons, the corresponding ranges are short and therefore
this is still a reasonable approximation.

Following this arguments,

in conventional covariant
density functional theory the contributions of the ex-
change terms are taken into account eﬀectively through
the adjustment of the parameters to experimental data.
As already mentioned, this model has been extremely
successful in describing a vast range of nuclear bulk prop-
erties, such as binding energies, radii, deformation pa-
rameters, giant resonances, etc. [47].

Of course, the pion mass is small and, therefore, its
exchange term should be taken into account explicitly.
There have been also recent studies, which found that
the inclusion of a tensor force has an eﬀect on very spe-
ciﬁc single-particle observables. It has been shown, for
instance, in Ref. [48], that tensor forces are responsible
for the shift of eﬀective single-particle levels in shell-
model calculations for exotic nuclei. Furthermore, the
spin-orbit alignment is crucial to the strongly repulsive
or attractive character of the tensor force between proton
or neutrons. So, in our case, where we want to study the
spin-orbit coupling, the eﬀect of tensor forces may prove
to have some quantitative importance, as this has also
been investigated in the nonrelativistic study in Ref. [24].
In the relativistic scheme tensor terms usually show
up, if one takes into account exchange terms. Relativistic
Hartree-Fock (RHF) theory including tensor terms has a
long history [49–51], but such calculations require a con-
siderable computational eﬀort. Therefore, for a long time
computer power was too limited to determine in a con-
sistent and successful way the parameters of a relativistic
density functional containing tensor terms. In the mean
time two groups have overcome these problems. Long et
al. developed a spherical RHF-code [52–54] in r-space
containing all the exchange terms for the σ-, ω-, and ρ
mesons and for the π meson with density-dependent cou-
pling constants. By adjusting the corresponding param-
eters to the usual data of binding energies and radii in
ﬁnite nuclei they determined several successful parameter
sets for the RHF description of nuclei all over the peri-
odic table. Serra et al. [55, 56] developed an RHF-code
in oscillator space taking into account only the exchange
term of the π meson because the other mesons σ, ω,
and ρ are relatively heavy and the corresponding force
is of short range. Therefore, as discussed before, the ex-
change terms of these mesons can be represented in the

static case to a good approximation by direct terms with
eﬀective coupling constants.

In this work we follow this method to take into account
tensor terms in the relativistic scheme. Basically two
terms are added in the Lagrangian of the system, the
ﬁrst is the term of the free pion ﬁeld included in
Lm as
given in Eq. (3),

is the strength of the one-pion-exchange

is the experimental
value of pion-nucleon coupling in free space. A factor √λ
is used as a multiplier to vary the coupling constant of the
pion from zero (λ=0) to its free value f f ree
(λ=1). This
comprises now a Relativistic Hartree-Fock model and its
parameters have been readjusted for diﬀerent values of
λ. This has been done following the same procedure that
was used to adjust the parameters of NL3 [27].

π

Concentrating in this ﬁt only to binding energies and
radii of ﬁnite nuclei, it was shown that the optimal ﬁt
was achieved for λ = 0, i.e., for vanishing pion-nucleon
interaction. However, a parameter set NL3RHF0.5 with
half the strength of the free pion (λ=0.5) describes in
addition to the other data the evolution of single-particle
structure in the tin isotopes measured by the Argonne
group [57] in (α,t) transfer reactions .

B. Particle-Vibrational Coupling

So far we discussed only mean-ﬁeld methods to de-
scribe single-particle energies. In this description of the
nuclear many-body system the nucleons move indepen-
dently.
In the next step we go beyond the mean-ﬁeld
description and include correlations by the method of
particle-vibration coupling (PVC). This is important for
our investigation of single-particle excitations, since the
coupling of the single-particle motion to the low-lying
phonons leads to a fragmentation of the single-particle
spectrum, a feature most prominent in spherical nu-
clei [58]. Even though conventional DFT reproduce fairly
well the gross structure of the SO splitting, the inclusion
of particle-vibration coupling produces a denser spectrum
near the Fermi surface which is in better agreement with
experimental observations.

In fact,

it is well known from Landau-Migdal the-
ory [59, 60] that particles in the many-body system can
interact with low-lying surface phonons and form Landau
quasiparticles surrounded by a cloud of excitons. Such

7

phenomena lead to a fragmentation of the single-particle
energies. In DFT such eﬀects can be taken into account
in the framework of time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT) [61]. In contrast to static DFT, which
depends only on the exact static density ρ0(r), its ba-
sis is the exact time-dependent density ρ(r,t), which de-
In static Kohn-Sham theory
pends on four variables.
the static density ρ0(r) is mapped onto a static single-
particle potential, the Kohn Sham potential or the static
self-energy ΣKS, which is easy to diagonalize and whose
local single-particle density is identical to the exact lo-
cal ground-state density ρ0(r).
In full analogy to the
static DFT, in the time-dependent case there exists a
time-dependent single-particle ﬁeld, the time-dependent
self-energy Σ(r, t) with a time-dependent density identi-
cal to the exact local single-particle density ρ(r,t) of the
time-dependent many-body problem. This is the Runge-
Gross theorem [62]. The problem is, that we know very
little about this time-dependent self-energy.
It is very
complicated because it contains all the memory eﬀects of
the system.

In the case, where the time-dependent motion is of a
small-amplitude character, one can apply linear-response
theory and determine the time-dependent self-energy in a
perturbative approach. In Fourier space one ends up with
a self-energy depending on the energy ω. Green’s func-
tion techniques and diagrammatic expansions are used
to provide a model for the energy-dependent self-energy
Σ(r, ω).

In a ﬁrst step one starts with the ground state of the
even system determined by static DFT and allows for
small amplitude vibrations around this static solution.
In the adiabatic approximation one assumes that, at each
time, the self-energy is identical to the static self-energy
calculated with the density ρ(r,t). This leads to time-
dependent mean-ﬁeld theory and in the limit of small
amplitudes to the well-known random-phase approxima-
tion (RPA), in the relativistic case to relativistic RPA
(RRPA), and in the case of pairing to quasiparticle RPA
(QRPA). In this way one calculates collective excitations
such as, for instance, the surface phonons, which are lin-
ear superpositions of ph excitations, by the diagonaliza-
tion of the RPA-matrix. The interaction between these
ph-pairs is given as the second derivative of the energy
density functional with respect to the density

In the next step one goes back to the description of
single-particle motion in the presence of the collective
vibrations. Starting from the static mean ﬁeld in the
self-energy, one adds terms which describe the coupling
of single-particle motion to the vibrations. These terms
are energy-dependent. The coupling is provided by the

where a virtual phonon with the frequency Ωµ is emitted,
moving the particle from level 1 to level k. More details
can be found in Refs. [63, 64] as well as an extension of
the approach to superﬂuid systems in Refs. [65, 66].

Combining this energy-dependent part of the self-
energy with the static part we obtain the full self-energy
Σ. It contains all the forces that act on a single nucleon.
It is non-local in space and time coordinates which gives
rise to an energy dependence of its Fourier transform:

Σ(r, r′; ω) = ˜Σ(r)δ(r

r′) + Σ(e)(r, r′; ω),

−
where the static part ˜Σ of the self-energy, i.e. the Dirac
Hamiltonian of the ground state reads:

(47)

ˆh = αp + β(m + S) + V = αp + βm + ˜Σ.

(48)

This leads to the Dyson equation describing the motion
of the quasiparticles in the presence of the vibrating mean
ﬁeld. It can be written in terms of Green’s function as

ˆh

(51)

For each quantum number k, there exist several solu-
tions ε(λ)
k , which are characterized by the index λ. So
the inclusion of a coupling between the single-particle
states and the vibrations leads to the fragmentation of
each single-particle state k. Taking into account the pole
structure of the self-energy (46), we get as an outcome an
eﬀective spectroscopic factor S(λ)
k which determines the
occupation probability for each fragment λ of the state
k.

Throughout this work, the Dirac equation (7) and the
Klein-Gordon equations (9)-(13) are solved by an ex-
pansion of the large and small components of the Dirac
spinors and of the meson ﬁelds in a spherical oscillator
basis (see Ref. [67]) with the frequency ℏω = 41A−1/3.
Since these eigenfunctions form an inﬁnite set it is nec-
essary to truncate this basis to NF = NB = 20 major
oscillator shells for the fermion and the meson ﬁelds re-
spectively. As explained in the following, in order to
study states that belong to the continuum, we have been
changing the number NF to vary from NF = 14
20
shells.

−

In the case of tensor forces (see Sec. III A) the Dirac-
Hartree-Fock equations are solved in the same spherical
oscillator basis with NF = 20 major oscillator shells and,
as discussed in Refs. [55, 56], the matrix elements of the
exchange term are evaluated in this basis.

For the calculations with particle-vibration coupling a
seniority zero pairing force was used.
In this case the
pairing potential is a multiple of the unity matrix and
the RHB-equations are identical to the RMF+BCS equa-
tions. The strength of the coupling constant of the pair-
ing force is adjusted in such a way, that the resulting gap
parameter is ∆ = 2 MeV which is close to its empirical
value. Further details of the particle-vibration coupling
are given in Refs. [63, 65, 66]. Non-spin-ﬂip phonons
6, and
µ with natural parities, angular momenta Lµ ≤
frequencies Ωµ
20 MeV have been included into the
self-energy (46) if their reduced transition probabilities
exceed 5% of the maximal ones for each Lµ. This has
been established as a standard truncation scheme for the
relativistic PVC calculations.

V. RESULTS

As mentioned in the introduction we concentrate our
study to the series of N = 20 isotones. We start with the
nucleus 40Ca with Z = 20 protons, where the last four
protons ﬁll the 1d3/2 orbit. By removing two protons
we go to 38Ar and by removing two more we reach 36S
which has its last two protons in the 2s1/2 orbit. The
density distribution of this state is peaked in the center
of the nucleus. and the removal of the two protons, as
we go to 34Si, leads to an occupation probability close to
zero. Therefore we have a central depletion in the proton
density and the formation of a dimple around the center
of the nuclear charge density. This is shown in Fig. 1,
where we plot the proton densities with respect to the
nuclear radius. For the ﬁrst three nuclei in this chain we
can see clearly a peak of the proton density at the center
of the nucleus whereas for 34Si there is a dimple, (see also
Ref. [21]).

Experimental evidence of the existence of this bubble
structure has been given very recently by Mutschler et
al.
in Ref. [20], where the one-proton removal reaction

1p) 33Al has been studied. Even though the occu-
34Si(
pancy of a single-particle orbit is not a direct observable,
its value can be calculated by using experimental data,
as it is explained in the methods section of that reference.
Therefore, an occupancy of 0.17(3) has been deduced for
the 2s1/2 proton state in 34Si, which is only 10% of the
1.7(4) occupancy of the same state in 36S, resulting in an
occupancy change of ∆(2s1/2) = 1.53.

This result came in addition to the ﬁndings of the ear-
lier experiment by Burgunder et. al. [19], where the en-
ergies and spectroscopic factors of the ﬁrst 1f7/2, 2p3/2,
2p1/2, and 1f5/2 neutron states in the nucleus 35Si were
measured through a (d, p) transfer reaction. Together
with the results of Refs. [22, 23], it was discovered that
2p3/2 spin-orbit splitting was consider-
the 2p = 2p1/2 −
ably reduced as one goes from 36S to 34Si.

An important aspect of the spin-orbit force is its den-
sity and isospin dependence.
It is clearly stated in
Refs. [19, 20] that the results of these two experiments
are ideal for a further theoretical investigation of the SO
force deduced from the various nuclear density function-
als. In particular, the extreme neutron-to-proton density
asymmetry in the case of 34Si and the subsequent large
and abrupt reduction in the size of the p spitting, can
provide a better constraint of the SO force, since these
results isolate the contributions coming mostly from its
density and its isospin dependence.

As discussed in the Sec. II A, the way the spin-orbit
force is included in relativistic density functional theory is
substantially diﬀerent from the nonrelativistic case. The
ratio W1/W2 plays an important role. In the ﬁrst case
this ratio is density-dependent and has a value close to
one, whereas for the latter case it has a ﬁxed value equal
to two. As we have already noted, this is the main reason
why we get such diﬀerent results in the calculations of the
spin-orbit splitting.

Nonrelativistic investigations have been carried out in
Ref. [24] for the Skyrme SLy5 [68] and Gogny D1S [46]

functionals and certain tensor extensions of those func-
tionals. The neutron f and p splittings for the nuclei
40Ca, 36S, and 34Si, were studied for the pure mean-ﬁeld
Hartree-Fock level. The corresponding results are shown
in Table I.

Following the above experimental and theoretical stud-
ies we calculate the energies of the same neutron states
and also the occupation probabilities of the 2s1/2 pro-
ton state in 36S and in 34Si for several covariant density
functionals.

As in the nonrelativistic case [24] the state 1f 5/2 in
the nuclei 40Ca, 38Ar, and 36S and the states 1f5/2 and
2p1/2 in 34Si are unbound for all forces we have used. In
contrast to Ref. [24] where the Schr¨odinger equation was
diagonalized in a box with ﬁnite radius, we expand the
single-particle solutions in an oscillator basis. So instead
of increasing the box radius, we change the number of os-
cillator shells. To determine the energies of the unbound
states we follow the same criteria mentioned in Ref. [24].
More speciﬁcally the energies of the single-particle res-
onant states should not change within their width by
changing the number of oscillator shells. Also the radial
proﬁle of those states is similar to that of bound states.
As an example we shown in Fig. 2 the radial proﬁles of
the wave-functions of the states 1f5/2 and 2p1/2 calcu-
lated with DD-ME2. For 40Ca they are bound and for
34Si they are unbound.

A. Pure mean-ﬁeld eﬀects

We begin our investigations with simple mean-ﬁeld
calculations without pairing: we solve the Relativistic
Hartree equations and investigate the behavior of the
single-neutron energies in the N = 20 isotone chain. In
this case the single-particle orbits are either fully occu-
pied or completely empty. Thus the occupancy of the
2s1/2 proton state is two for the nuclei 40Ca, 38Ar, and
36S and zero for 34Si. This will give us the pure relativis-
tic mean-ﬁeld eﬀect on the spin-orbit splittings.

The results for this case are given in Table II. In the

TABLE II: Spin-orbit splittings in MeV (Upper part) and
their relative reductions (Lower part) for f and p neutron
states in the case of no pairing.

1f5/2 and p = 2p3/2 −
upper part we show the f = 1f7/2 −
2p1/2 energy splittings for each speciﬁc functional and
for each of the nuclei 40Ca, 38Ar, 36S, and 34Si. In the
lower part we present the relative reduction of the f and
p splittings again for every functional, ﬁrst as we move
from 40Ca to 36S and then as we go from 36S to 34Si. We

also show in the last row the experimental values of the
splittings and the reductions for 40Ca [22], 36S [23], and
34Si [19].

For 40Ca we use the values of the centroids for the dis-
tribution of the respective fragments. These data can
be compared directly with our theoretical results.
In
the other two cases this is not possible, because the ex-
perimental centroids are not known. Therefore for the
2p1/2 in both 36S and 34Si we use the major frag-
2p3/2 −
ment of each state. For the 1f5/2 state in 36S we use the
major contribution that comes from three states centered
at 5.61 MeV with a total spectroscopic factor SF = 0.36,
and in 34Si the broad structure around 5.5 MeV with a
calculated SF = 0.32. Even though this is not directly
comparable with our results, we use it as an indication
of the size of the reduction we should expect.

A schematic representation of our results together with
the results for the nonrelativistic SLy5 and D1S models,
is given in Fig. 3. For all the models we plot the evolution
of the p and the f spin-orbit splittings as a function of
the mass number A.

In this ﬁrst approach we observe a gradual reduction
in the f splittings of about 0.3-0.4 MeV at each step as we
move down the chain of isotones. This is also apparent
from the fact that the curves that show the evolution of
the f -splitting in Fig. 3 have a similar slope for the diﬀer-
ent functionals. The total relative reduction is between
15%-19% and around 5%-7% at each step.

In contrast to the f-splittings, the p splittings change
only slightly for the three ﬁrst nuclei, the only exception
being the functional DD-MEδ. Only when we move from
36S to 34Si we ﬁnd a large reduction for the p splittings of
the order of 40% to 60%. Qualitatively this picture is in
line with the experiment. However, the absolute size of
the p-splitting in 34Si for most of our models is smaller
than the respective experimental value. This leads in
certain cases to an even larger relative reduction than
what we should expect.

 
 
 
 
The results of the nonrelativistic pure mean-ﬁeld cal-
culations shown in Table I provide a similar qualitative
picture. From 40Ca to 36S the f - and p- splittings are
only slightly decreasing with relative reductions 6% and
8% to 8% and 13%. In the transition from 36S to 34Si
there is also the sudden and relatively large reduction in
the size of the p-splitting of about 43%, but also a bigger
reduction of the size of the f -splittings.

When we compare relativistic and nonrelativistic re-
sults, we observe the following diﬀerences.
In general,
the sizes of the splittings in all the relativistic models are
smaller than the respective splittings in nonrelativistic
SLy5 and D1S models. More speciﬁcally in the nuclei
40Ca and 36S, where the proton density has the normal
proﬁle, i.e., no central depletion, the diﬀerence in the size
of f -splittings is in the order of 1-2 MeV and the size of
the p-splittings is around 0.5 MeV

In the interesting case of the bubble nucleus 34Si, the
f -splittings are of the same size because of the bigger rel-
ative reduction that appears in the nonrelativistic case.
This is not present in the relativistic models. However
there is a diﬀerence in the p-splittings which are rela-
tively small in size for all the relativistic functionals. This
is translated into a relative reduction of the p-splitting
when we go from 36S to 34Si, which is larger for most
of the relativistic models as compared woth the relative
reduction for nonrelativistic models (see tables I and II).
To understand all these results we have to investigate
explicitly the spin-orbit force and especially its isospin
dependence which is very important in the case of 34Si
with a large neutron-to-proton asymmetry. As we dis-
cussed in Sec. II A, in both relativistic and nonrelativis-
tic models this force can be approximately written as in
Eq. (18)

Here W is given by the expression

Wτ = W1∇ρτ + W2∇ρτ ′6=τ .

(52)

(53)

In most of the nuclei the properties of the nuclear force
lead to an almost constant density in the interior of the
nucleus. The spin-orbit force is mostly determined by the
gradient of the densities and, therefore, by the surface
diﬀuseness. This creates an attractive potential peaked
at the surface. States with large ℓ-values have larger ℓs
values. In addition, they are peaked near the surface and,
therefore, they are inﬂuenced more by this force. This
produces the large f -splittings and the much smaller p-
splittings in 40Ca, 38Ar, and 36S.

On the other hand, bubble nuclei like 34Si have a cen-
tral density depletion, which provides an additional com-
ponent to the spin-orbit force in the interior of the nu-
cleus with the opposite sign, since the derivative of the
density is positive at the origin. So, together with the
attractive well around the surface we also have a re-
pulsive peak close to the center of the nucleus; see also
Refs. [69, 70]. Neutron states with low angular momen-
tum have larger amplitudes near the center, as one can

11

see in Fig. 4. This implies that they feel a much weaker
spin-orbit force and it explains the sudden reduction of
the p-splittings when we go from 36S to 34Si as shown
in the left panel of Fig. 3. This eﬀect is not seen for
the f -splittings in the relativistic models (right panel of
Fig. 3).

To understand the aforementioned diﬀerences between
relativistic and nonrelativistic models, we concentrate on
the isospin dependence of the SO term W , which is de-
termined by the ratio between the two parameters W1
and W2. In the relativistic models the value of this ratio
depends on the density and can take diﬀerent values for
various nuclei, especially for functionals where the cou-
pling constants are also density-dependent, as explained
in Ref. [71].
In that reference there is a calculation of
this ratio for several nuclei, including 34Si, as a function
of the nuclear radius. For the functionals DD-ME2 and
DD-PC1 at the nuclear center one has W 1/W 2
1.07.
We also give in Table II a rough estimate of this ratio for
the non- linear models, using Eq. (24) and neglecting its
density dependence. In general, for the relativistic den-
sity functionals, the value of this ratio is close to unity
and the isospin dependence is very weak. On the other
hand, for the standard Skyrme and Gogny models one
has W 1/W 2 = 2 and a stronger isospin dependence. As
it was concluded in Ref. [17], the additional isospin de-
pendence in the nonrelativistic models creates a stronger
spin-orbit force around the surface and produces larger
splittings for states with large angular momentum.

≈

This picture is reversed in the case of a bubble nucleus,
where the size of the repulsive peak is bigger for the rel-
ativistic models, as very clearly shown in Ref. [70]. As a
result the SO force will be even weaker and the size of
the splitting of the p-states is more dramatically reduced
than in the standard nonrelativistic forces. Our results
lead to the same conclusion.

B. The eﬀect of pairing correlations

Pairing correlations and the related pairing gap can af-
fect the size of the SO splittings. Already in Ref. [21] it
was shown within the framework of relativistic Hartree-
Bogoliubov calculations that pairing correlations reduce
the size of the bubble in 34Si. According to this result and
based on the previous discussion we expect to see a weak-
ening of the bubble eﬀect and therefore larger absolute
sizes and smaller relative reductions of the p-splitting,
as compared with the pure Hartree-calculations without
pairing.

As discussed in Sec. II B, in superﬂuid nuclei we deal
with quasiparticles. The occupancy of each state is cal-
culated self-consistently. It is determined by the strength
of the pairing force. Obviously, for cases with zero pair-
ing the occupation probability is one for occupied states
below the Fermi surface and zero for unoccupied states
above the Fermi surface. Subsequently, in the present
work, we introduce pairing correlations in the proton sub-

system and evaluate again the single-particle energies of
the same neutron states as before. This is done for each
nucleus, except from the case of 40Ca which is a doubly
magic nucleus. We also calculate the occupation proba-
bilities of the proton 2s1/2 state for 36S and 34Si, since
the bubble structure in 34Si is created because of this
state being almost empty.

In this context we use the TMR separable pairing force
of Ref. [45] for the short range correlations. As we men-
tioned in Sec. II B, this kind of separable pairing force has
been adjusted to reproduce the pairing gap of the Gogny
force D1S in symmetric nuclear matter [45]. Both forces
are of ﬁnite range and therefore they show no ultraviolet
divergence and do not depend on a pairing cut- oﬀ. They
provide a very reasonable description of pairing correla-
tions all over the periodic table with a ﬁxed set of param-
eters. However, careful investigations of the size of these
pairing correlations by comparing theoretical results with
experimental odd-even mass diﬀerences and experimen-
tal rotational moments of inertia [72] have shown that the
pairing correlations produced by these forces are slightly
too strong for heavy nuclei and slightly too week for light
nuclei. To avoid such problems in details of the descrip-
tion of pairing correlations in our relatively light isotonic
chain and following the prescription of Ref. [72] we have
introduced a scaling factor for the strength of the TMR-
force. To adjust this factor in the proton channel we have
used the version of the three-point odd-even staggering
(OES) formula proposed in Ref. [73]:

This is actually equivalent to the original three-point gap
formula (38) but given for odd nuclei ∆3(N
1) (see
Ref. [74]). The binding energies were taken from the
atomic mass evaluation in Ref. [75] and the resulting gaps
are shown in Table III.

−

The SO splittings and the respective reductions found
in these calculations are shown in Table IV. In Fig. 4 we
present again a schematic representation of the evolution
of SO splittings for all the forces with respect to the mass
number.

Comparing the results of the calculations including
pairing with the previous pure mean-ﬁeld results we get
the same qualitative picture. The f -splittings show again
a gradual reduction as we go down the chain of isotones.
The p-splittings stay roughly in the same size between
the ﬁrst three nuclei and are reduced dramatically for
the last nucleus where there is the bubble structure. The
inclusion of pairing correlation increases the f - splittings

This change is very small for 38Ar and slightly bigger for
36S for the p-states and the other way around for the f -
splittings, where in the case of 36S they are practically un-
changed. For the last nucleus 34Si this picture is reversed

and one gets smaller f -splittings and larger p-splittings
again in the same order of magnitude of 0.1MeV. This
last eﬀect corrects for the enhanced eﬀect of the bubble
structure and the sudden reduction of the p-splitting as
one goes from 36S to 34Si.

For a better understanding how pairing correlations
lead to this diﬀerences we present in Table V the occu-
pation factors of the 2s1/2 proton state in 36S and 34Si.
In addition we compare in Fig. 5 the radial proﬁles of the
total and proton densities of 38Ar, 36S, and 34Si with and
without pairing for the parameter set NL3.

For 38Ar, pairing aﬀects mostly the 1d proton orbit
with its two last two protons in the 1d3/2 state. Here
the surface density becomes more diﬀused and the spin-
orbit force has a greater overlap with the f neutron states
making the corresponding splittings slightly bigger. In
the 36S pairing inﬂuences the central densities reducing
the size of the peak with a tendency to ﬂatten it out.
This can also be seen by the reduced occupancy of the
2s1/2 proton state which is now smaller than two. This
creates a less attractive SO force around the center and
so the splittings of the neutron p states appear somewhat
smaller.

For the case of 34Si pairing reduces the dip at the cen-
ter of the bubble as it has been noted already in Ref. [21].
This is caused by the increasing occupancy of the previ-
ously empty 2s1/2 proton state, as shown in Table V. As
we have seen, this reduction of the bubble leads to an
increase of the p-splittings by almost 0.1 MeV. Together
with the previous discussion about 36S the relative re-
duction of this splitting comes closer to the experimental
value deduced from the major fragments.

The above analysis shows that there is a direct relation
between the size of p-splittings and the occupancy of the
2s1/2 proton state.
In order to elaborate this eﬀect in
more detail we carry out RHB-calculations with varying
pairing strength by gradually increasing the scaling factor
in the TMR-force. As discussed this leads on one side
to a reduction of the corresponding occupancy change
∆(2s1/2) between 36S and 34Si and on the other side to
a reduction of the relative change in the SO-splitting for

As the pairing force increases the bubble structure
becomes less dramatic. Therefore, by studying the
corresponding change in the relative reduction of the
2p1/2 neutron spin-orbit splitting we get an ad-
2p3/2 −
ditional method to further investigate the isospin depen-
dence of the eﬀective spin-orbit interaction for the diﬀer-
ent covariant density functionals. This has been done in
the case of the TMR paring force and for all the relativis-
tic models we have used in our previous calculations and
the results are shown in Fig. 6. The empty symbols de-
pict the results we got using the three-point gap formula
to adjust the pairing force. For comparison we show the
combined results from the experiments in Refs. [19, 20].
This helps to distinguish between the various models. We
ﬁnd that DD-ME2, DD-PC1, and PC-PF1 are the most
successful in reproducing the experimental results.

C. Extensions: tensor forces and particle-vibration
coupling

In this last part we extend the standard formulation
of the covariant density functional models in two ways.
First we include explicitly a tensor term as discussed
in Sec. III A. This extension remains on the mean-ﬁeld
level. In the second case we go beyond mean-ﬁeld by tak-
ing into consideration the coupling of the single-particle
states to the low-lying surface modes, as discussed in
Sec. III B.

1. The eﬀect of the tensor force

As we have already stated the tensor part of the nu-
clear force plays an essential role in the description of

the single-particle structure [48, 56, 76]. As discussed
in Sec. III A in covariant density functional theory ex-
change terms are usually not taken into account, because
the Fierz theorem shows that, for zero range forces, they
can be expanded over the direct terms by reshuﬄing the
coupling constants of the various spin-isospin channels.
Since the coupling constants are adjusted to experimen-
tal data anyhow, this seems to be a reasonable approx-
imation for the heavy mesons σ, ω, and ρ, which lead
to forces of relatively short range. The direct term of
the pion does not contribute because of parity conserva-
tion, but its mass is small and, therefore, its exchange

to a tensor term in the functional. In the following we
show results of relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations as
discussed in Sec. III A and in Ref. [56].

In particular, we investigate in the speciﬁc case of the
bubble nucleus 34Si and the corresponding dramatic re-
duction in the p-splitting as compared with 36S, whether
the explicit inclusion of the tensor force changes the size
of the splitting and the amount of the reduction.

±

The eﬀect of the tensor force between neutrons and
protons has been investigated in great detail in conﬁgu-
ration interaction (CI) calculations [48] and in mean-ﬁeld
calculations [76]. The spin-orbit alignment is very crucial
for the attractive or repulsive character of this interac-
tion. Nucleons occupying, for instance, a proton orbit j>
1/2) can change the eﬀective single-
(where j>;< = ℓ
particle energies of neutrons occupying the orbit j′
> or
the orbit j′
< through the monopole eﬀect of the tensor
force. If the spins of the two states are antiparallel, the
force is attractive and, if they are parallel, the force is re-
pulsive. In the particular case of the one-pion-exchange
this speciﬁc eﬀect has been also identiﬁed in the RHF
calculations of Ref. [56]. The eﬀect of the tensor force is
mostly important between neutrons and protons, it in-
creases with the orbital angular momentum ℓ and also
with the radial overlap between the orbits.

In Fig. 7 we show in a schematic way the positions of
the neutron states 2p1/2, 2p3/2, and 1f5/2 using 1f7/2 as
a reference state, calculated with the relativistic interac-
tion NL3RHF0.5 which includes the one-pion-exchange
tensor force with half the strength of the free one-pion-
exchange force, as discussed in Sec. III A. These calcula-
tions have been carried out within the frozen gap approx-
imation for the pairing channel and with the values of the
proton gap parameters given in Table III. In Table VI we

(upper part) and relative reductions (bottom part), for the
case of tensor forces. For comparison we also show the results
from Ref. [24].

tensor terms have been included and were adjusted to-
gether with the spin-orbit parameters. Details are given
in Ref. [24]. We have to emphasize, however, that the
tensor force used in the nonrelativistic calculations in
Ref. [24] is of zero range, whereas the tensor force in these
relativistic calculations is of ﬁnite range because of the
low mass of the pion. We show in Fig. 8 the correspond-
ing single-particle energies as a function of A. Finally,
in Fig. 9 we have plotted the evolution of the spin-orbit
splittings as it is done in Figs. 3 and 4, but now just for
the NL3 force in order to compare between pure mean-
ﬁeld, pairing, and tensor eﬀects.

We observe that the inclusion of the tensor force has
a more pronounced eﬀect in the transition from 40Ca to
36S than in the transition from 36S to 34Si. Following
the rule that we described in the beginning of the cur-
rent section, we recognize that as we move from 40Ca to
36S and remove the four protons from the j< proton state
π1d3/2, the attractive eﬀect of the tensor interaction on
the j′
> neutron state ν1f7/2 is reduced and, thus, this
state is shifted upwards, from its starting point in 40Ca.
On the other side the j′
<; ν1f5/2 state, which in 40Ca
is repelled by the protons of the π1d3/2 state, is shifted
downwards as we go to 36S. The combination of all these
eﬀects leads to an enhanced quenching of the f -splitting
as we go from 40Ca to 36S. This is also seen by the much
steeper blue line that corresponds to NL3RHF0.5 case
in the right panel in Fig. 9. The same behavior can be
observed also for the j′
<; ν2p1/2 neu-
tron states, although the eﬀect on the absolute size of the
splitting is smaller in those cases.

FIG. 9: Evolution of the p and f SO splittings for NL3

nucleus 34Si we see in Fig. 8 that both the f and p states
stay at the same distance relative to the NL3 calculations.
This shows that the large reduction of the p-splitting is
a pure spin-orbit eﬀect, a picture that also agrees with
the nonrelativistic results.

Finally, we have measured an occupancy of the 2s1/2
proton state of 0.18 with the NL3RHF0.5, which is larger
than the 0.10 value in the case of NL3 on the RH level
for the same pairing scheme. This indicates that the ten-
sor force counteracts to some extent the eﬀect of pairing
that we described in the previous section, and leads to a
smaller size, from 0.74 MeV to 0.66 MeV and a slightly
larger reduction, from 56% to 60%, for the particular p-
splitting.

 
 
2. The eﬀect of particle-vibration coupling

As we mentioned in Sec. III B, the coupling of the
single-particle states to low-lying phonons leads to a
fragmentation of the single-particle levels and, therefore,
sometimes to considerable shifts of the major compo-
nents, i.e. of the components with the largest spectro-
scopic factor. This is, in particular, important for states
close to the Fermi surface. For our calculations we used
the density functional NL3∗ [28] and a constant pairing
gap of ∆ = 2 MeV, which is consistent with its empirical
value of 12.0/√A for the considered mass region.

TABLE VII: Comparison for the spin-orbit splittings (Upper
part) and their relative reductions (Lower part) of the major
fragments between the relativistic PVC model and the corre-
sponding experimental results.

After the solution of the Dyson equation (51) we have
the ability to isolate the major contributions to each sin-
gle particle state and compare its energy directly with
the experimental results from Ref. [19], as shown in table
VII. This is also done schematically in Fig. 10 where we
compare the results of the PVC calculations for the nu-
clei 36S and 34Si with the experimental values of Ref. [19].
More speciﬁcally, we show the positions of the major frag-
ments and the splittings between the f and p states as
well as their spectroscopic factors. The experimentally
observed reduction of the spin-orbit splitting is 43% for
the p states.
It is in rather good agreement with the
results obtained from the theoretical PVC calculations,
which show a reduction of 39%. In both cases these are
the splittings for the major fragments. Notice, that in
the PVC calculations we have not included isospin-ﬂip
phonons as it is done, for instance, in Ref. [77]. It has
been observed that the inclusion of such phonons causes
an additional fragmentation and shifts of the dominant
fragments, bringing the results to a better agreement
with data. However, the latter approach is, so far, not
yet adopted to the case of open-shell nuclei. It will be
considered in the future.

In Fig. 10 we show in analogy to Fig. 7 the positions
of the neutron states 2p1/2, 2p3/2 and 1f5/2 using the
1f7/2 as reference state for the nuclei 37S [Figs. 10(a)-
10(c)] and 35Si [Figs. 10(d)-10(f)]. The experimental

using the same density functional.

with results of PVC-calculations with the density func-
tional NL3∗ in Figs. 10(b) and 10(e). In this ﬁgure the
experimental energies as well as the energies of the PVC-
calculations correspond to the major components of the
corresponding fragmented level. Only for the 1f5/2 or-
bits we show in Fig. 10(a) the experimental fragmen-
tation and in Fig. 10(d) the area of the experimental
fragmentation. In order to study the eﬀect of particle-
vibration coupling we show in Figs. 10(c) and 10(f) calcu-
lations with the same density functional without particle-
vibration coupling.

We ﬁnd that in both nuclei the SO-splitting of the 1f
orbitals is reproduced relatively well. Particle vibrational
coupling has only a small inﬂuence on this splitting. On
the other side, all 2p orbits are shifted downwards closer
to the 1f7/2 orbit as it is also observed in the experiment.
It is well known, that this eﬀect is in particular large
for levels close to the Fermi surface, i.e., larger for the
2p3/2 orbit than for the 2p1/2 orbit. As a result, the
SO-splitting of the 2p orbits is increased considerably by
particle-vibration coupling. As compared with the much
too small SO-splitting for the 2p orbits without PVC, it

is now much closer to the experimental value.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this study we have calculated the single-particle en-
ergies of the spin-orbit doublets 1f7/2-1f5/2 and 2p3/2-
2p1/2 in order to investigate the spin-orbit splittings and
their evolution as we move along the chain of isotones
with N = 20: 40Ca, 38Ar, 36S, and 34Si. We used several
relativistic functionals of three diﬀerent types: nonlin-
ear meson-coupling, density-dependent meson coupling
and density-dependent point-coupling models. Further-
more, we used the separable TMR pairing force of ﬁ-
nite range, which is essentially equivalent to the pairing
part of the Gogny force D1S, to determine the eﬀect of
pairing on the size and on the reduction of the SO split-
tings. Finally, we considered speciﬁc extensions that go
beyond the simple Hartree case; namely, the inclusion
of one-pion exchange which induces a tensor force and
particle-vibration coupling that takes into account cor-
relations between single-particle states going beyond the
mean-ﬁeld approximation.

In general, we observe a signiﬁcant reduction of the
2p1/2 splitting for neutron states when we go
2p3/2 −
from 36S to 34Si as it is observed in the experiment. On
the pure mean-ﬁeld level most of the forces show a rel-
atively large reduction. When we include pairing, this
reduction becomes less and less dramatic with increasing
pairing correlations, because the occupation of the 2s1/2
proton-orbit changes less rapidly between 36S and 34Si.
The isospin dependence of the eﬀective spin-orbit force
is weaker in the relativistic models and, therefore, the
reduction is also less pronounced in these models than in
the nonrelativistic ones.

Finally, we went beyond the conventional Hartree level
and included two eﬀects, which have a strong inﬂuence
on the single-particle structure, the tensor term and
particle-vibration coupling.

Here we found that the tensor term induced by the
one-pion-exchange force has a relatively small eﬀect. It
acts to some extent in the opposite direction of pairing.
It increases the quenching of the spin-orbit distinctly for

17

the f and to a smaller extent for the p states when going
from 40Ca to 36S, showing the tensor character of those
reductions. On the other hand, for the transition from
36S to 34Si the sizes of the splittings are only slightly re-
duced for both nuclei and, thus, the relative reductions
remain practically unchanged, indicating that they come
purely from the spin-orbit interaction. Such an eﬀect is
also observed in the nonrelativistic case [24] as seen in Ta-
bles I and VI. However, particle-vibration coupling acts
in the same direction as pairing. We ﬁnd that the relative
reduction of the splitting between 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 neu-
tron states decreases. This is consistent with the general
eﬀect of PVC to produce a more dense spectrum near the
Fermi surface. Finally, PVC leads to a reasonable agree-
ment with the experimental data in the isotone chain
with N = 20.

Of course, there are many open questions: Nearly all
of the functionals used here have been adjusted to ex-
perimental bulk properties, such as binding energies and
radii. Only the strength of the relativistic tensor force
in the functional NL3RHF0.5 has been optimized at the
same time by comparing with the single-particle struc-
ture of tin isotopes. In principle, the parameters of all
these functionals should be adjusted only after including
the additional eﬀects of tensor correlations and particle-
vibration coupling. This is a very ambitious task for
the future, but we have shown in this investigation at
least the inﬂuence and the relative importance of several
corrections beyond the conventional Hartree level for a
successful description of the spin-orbit splitting and its
isospin dependence.
