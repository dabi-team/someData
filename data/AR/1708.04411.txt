ABSTRACT

The physical conditions that determine whether or not solar active regions (ARs) produce strong ﬂares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are not yet well understood. Here we investigate the association between
electric-current neutralization, magnetic shear along polarity inversion lines (PILs), and eruptive activity in four
ARs; two emerging and two well-developed ones. We ﬁnd that the CME-producing ARs are characterized by
a strongly non-neutralized total current, while the total current in the ARs that did not produce CMEs is almost
perfectly neutralized. The difference in the PIL-shear between these two groups is much less pronounced,
which suggests that the degree of current-neutralization may serve as a better proxy for assessing the ability of
ARs to produce CMEs.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is well established that solar ﬂares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) are powered by the free magnetic energy
stored in volumetric electric currents in the corona, predom-
inantly in active regions (ARs). However, it remains unclear
how well these currents are neutralized. Full neutralization
requires the “direct” coronal currents that connect the AR po-
larity centers to be surrounded by “return” currents of equal
total strength and opposite direction, i.e., the total current has
to be zero not only for the whole AR (which is always ap-
proximately the case for well-isolated ARs), but also for each
polarity individually. Parker (1996) suggested that ARs are
comprised of small, magnetically isolated ﬂux tubes which
are individually current-neutralized, so that a whole AR must
be neutralized as well. Melrose (1991, 1995), however, ar-
gued that net (non-neutralized) currents can emerge from the
solar interior with the emergence of magnetic ﬂux. Longcope
& Welsch (2000) devised a simpliﬁed model of ﬂux-tube
emergence that suggests that most return currents are trapped
below or at the photosphere, and Wheatland et al. (2000)
found most of the 21 ARs he studied to be non-neutralized;
both works support Melrose’s scenario. However, even un-
der the assumption that the total current in an AR is organized
essentially in the form of a single coronal ﬂux rope, it is still
often hypothesized that the current has to be neutralized since
it is formed by localized ﬂows and/or the emergence of a neu-
tralized sub-photospheric ﬂux rope (see T¨or¨ok et al. 2014).

The distribution of direct and return currents in ARs
may be relevant for their ability to produce CMEs (Forbes

2010). The existence of non-potential magnetic ﬁelds prior to
CMEs, indicated for instance by magnetic shear along PILs
(e.g., Mackay et al. 2010), implies the presence of an electric
current that is likely concentrated in a relatively narrow chan-
nel above the PIL, presumably in form of a ﬂux rope, em-
bedded into an approximately potential magnetic ﬁeld. The
equilibrium and stability properties of such a ﬂux rope de-
pend largely on the “hoop force”, referred to a unit length of
the rope. The hoop force is a “self-force” that solely origi-
nates from the interaction of the current elements in the rope
with one another.
In equilibrium, this force is counterbal-
anced by the additional interaction of the current elements
with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, which in this case plays the
role of a “strapping” ﬁeld. A ﬁrst-order term of expansion
in a/Rc, where a is the cross-sectional radius and Rc the
axis-curvature radius of the rope, shows that the hoop force
is proportional to the square of the total current (Zakharov &
Shafranov 1986), which, in turn, is an algebraic sum of direct
and return currents. Thus, at least in this approximation, the
hoop force vanishes for current-neutralized ﬂux ropes. Un-
der the assumption that ARs have to be current-neutralized,
it is therefore sometimes argued that mechanisms that invoke
the hoop force, such as the torus instability (Kliem & T¨or¨ok
2006), cannot play a role in the development of CMEs.

However, in order to alter the hoop force to a point that
deviations from equilibrium are inhibited, the return current
likely has to be organized in a coherent and compact manner
around the direct-current channel (Forbes 2010). As we shall
see, this does not seem to be the case for real ARs. Moreover,
MHD simulations of coronal ﬂux-rope formation by photo-

spheric vortex ﬂows showed that current-neutralization only
occurs if the vortices are relatively far away from the PIL. If
they are close enough to produce magnetic shear along the
PIL, the direct and return currents become imbalanced, and
net-currents develop around the PIL (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2003;
Dalmasse et al. 2015). Simulations of the emergence of a
current-neutralized ﬂux rope into the corona show a simi-
lar effect: signiﬁcant PIL-shear develops, and the ﬂux-rope-
current becomes non-neutralized (T¨or¨ok et al. 2014). In both
cases, the hoop force in the coronal ﬂux rope does not vanish
and unstable deviations from equilibrium leading to CMEs
become possible.

These theoretical considerations suggest a relationship be-
tween the degree of current-neutralization, the amount of
PIL-shear, and the eruptive activity of ARs, which has not
yet been explored systematically using real data. Observa-
tionally, the distribution of direct and return currents can be
inferred from photospheric vector magnetograms by calcu-
lating the vertical current density. Venkatakrishnan & Ti-
wari (2009) and Gosain et al. (2014) considered isolated
sunspots, which were found to be well-neutralized in most

quiet region (NOAA AR 10940: Georgoulis et al. 2012),
and strong net-currents in two highly-eruptive regions (ARs
10930 and 11158: Ravindra et al. 2011; Georgoulis et al.
2012; Petrie 2013; Janvier et al. 2014; Vemareddy et al.
2015), which supports the aforementioned simulation results.
Here we carry out a pilot study to explore the aforemen-
tioned relationship. We investigate four ARs, two of which
produced CMEs. In order to make our small sample as rep-
resentative as possible, we consider two emerging and two
well-developed ARs. We describe our data processing and
the computation of the relevant quantities in Section 2. In
Section 3 we present our results, which are summarized and
discussed in Section 4.

2. DATA AND CALCULATIONS

2.1. Data

We consider a representative sample of two emerging and
two well-developed ARs, two of which produced CMEs. The
emerging regions are AR 11158 and AR 11072; the devel-
oped ones AR 11429 and AR 12192. AR 11072 is a simple
bipolar region that did not produce ﬂares larger than C-class
In contrast,
during its disk passage (Liu & Schuck 2012).
the complex ARs 11158, 11429, and 12192 were very active
(e.g., Sun et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Aschwanden et al.
2014; Liu et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2015; Thalmann et al. 2015).
AR 11158 produced three M3 ﬂares or larger, including one
X2.2 ﬂare. AR 11429 produced seven M3 ﬂares or larger, in-
cluding three X-class ﬂares. All these ﬂares were associated
with CMEs. On the other hand, AR 12192 produced seven-
teen M3 ﬂares or larger during its disk passage, including six

X-class ﬂares, but no CMEs were detected to originate from
the ﬂare-productive core-region of the AR.

We use the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s (SDO; Pesnell
et al. 2012) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scher-
rer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) vector magnetic ﬁeld data
(Hoeksema et al. 2014) to calculate the electric-current dis-
tribution and the PIL magnetic shear for our ARs.

2.2. Calculation of Current-Neutralization

∂x − ∂Bx

For each AR, the vertical electric-current density, Jz =
0 ( ∂By
µ−1
∂y ), is derived from the processed HMI vector
magnetic ﬁeld data. The direct, DC, and return, RC, cur-
rents are computed for each polarity by integrating Jz values
of different sign separately. In order to associate the correct
sign of Jz to the DC (and hence to the RC), we search for
the dominant sign of Jz/Bz in the polarity centers and in the
vicinity of the PIL, above which the direct-current channel
is assumed to reside. For ARs 11158 and 11429 the asso-
ciation is very clear, while for ARs 11072 and 12192 it is
not. However, as we will show, the quantity relevant for our
investigation, |DC/RC|, is close to unity for the two latter
ARs, making the choice of the sign of Jz interchangeable.

Complex ARs typically contain signiﬁcant non-eruptive
ﬂux that is irrelevant for our investigation. Such ﬂux may
connect to other polarities of the region, to neighboring ARs,
or to remote areas on the Sun. Thus, to select the integra-
tion area for complex ARs, we employ a combination of
non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolations (Wiegel-
mann 2004) and photospheric maps of the squashing factor
Q (Titov 2007; Titov et al. 2011).

As an example, Figure 1 shows the obtained integration
area for AR 11158. Only the inner polarity pair of this
quadrupolar AR is shown, as the outer polarities were not
involved in the region’s eruptive activity (Sun et al. 2012).
We ﬁrst calculate Q at the lower boundary using an NLFFF
model. While the pattern of Q is complicated, one can iden-
tify an elongated patch encircled by high-Q contours. By
tracing ﬁeld lines along this contour, we see that it outlines
the boundary of closed ﬂux connecting the polarities. We
then manually extract a slightly larger region and trace ﬁeld
lines from each pixel; those with end points outside of the re-
gion are eliminated. Therefore all remaining ﬁeld lines close
within the region. To obtain the ﬁnal integration area, we
apply two common morphology operators, dilation and ero-
sion, to the input image, in order to remove noise, isolate
individual elements, and join disparate elements. The ﬁnal
integration area covers most of the polarities, yet excludes
signiﬁcant ﬂux, especially in the positive polarity. The re-
sulting |DC/RC| ratios are |DC/RC|+ = 2.376 ± 0.045
and |DC/RC|− = 3.475 ± 0.099, respectively. The er-
rors are estimated from the uncertainties of the vector mag-
netic ﬁeld data (Hoeksema et al. 2014). For comparison, the
ratios obtained from the whole area shown in Figure 1 are
|DC/RC|+ = 1.997 ± 0.030 and |DC/RC|− = 2.339 ±

CURRENT-NEUTRALIZATION, SHEAR, AND ERUPTIVE ACTIVITY

0.046, which demonstrates that |DC/RC| can signiﬁcantly
increase if irrelevant ﬂux is excluded.

2.3. Calculation of PIL Magnetic Shear

In order to estimate the magnetic shear along the main PIL
of an AR, we calculate the average magnetic shear angle, Φ,
at and around the PIL. To this end, we ﬁrst locate the PIL in
the integration area for each vector magnetogram. The pix-
els on the PIL are set to be 1; remaining pixels are set to 0.
The PIL is then expanded by dilating a 3×3 element. The
resulting image includes non-zero pixels at and around the
PIL, and zero pixels everywhere else. We then use this mask
to compute Φ, by averaging the shear over all non-zero pix-
els where the ﬁeld strength is larger than 300 G, which is
3σ of the vector magnetic ﬁeld data noise (Hoeksema et al.
2014). The shear for each pixel is calculated following pre-
vious studies (Hagyard et al. 1984; Wang et al. 1994), which
deﬁned it by the angle between the horizontal components of
the observed ﬁeld and a potential ﬁeld that is computed from
the observed vertical ﬁeld using Fourier transforms (Alissan-
drakis 1981; Gary 1989).

3. RESULTS

3.1. Two Emerging ARs

We ﬁrst analyze the two emerging ARs for a time period
of six days, which covers the entire emerging process and
some evolution afterwards. Figure 2 shows the ARs, together
with a ﬂux-emergence simulation (Leake et al. 2013) that in-
cludes an existing, arcade-like coronal magnetic ﬁeld, for
comparison. AR 11072 is a simple bipolar region, which
emerges quickly within two days and evolves slowly after-
|DC/RC| remains close to unity during the evo-
wards.
lution,
the currents remain almost perfectly neutral-
i.e.,
ized. No clear large-scale, coherent current pattern devel-
ops. Rather, the direct and return currents are mostly dis-
tributed in small, alternating patches (see also Cheng & Ding
2016).
In contrast, AR 11158 has a complex quadrupolar
magnetic conﬁguration. The region is still emerging at the
end of our 6-day observation period. As mentioned above,
only the inner polarity pair is relevant here. After the onset
of ﬂux emergence, |DC/RC| becomes signiﬁcantly larger
than unity, i.e., the AR becomes strongly non-neutralized
(cf. Janvier et al. 2014). As for AR 11072, patches of al-
ternating direct and return current develop. However, now
also an organized, double-J-shaped pattern of strong direct
currents forms around the PIL, in very good agreement with
the MHD simulation. Analyzing this simulation, T¨or¨ok et al.
(2014) found that, as the rising ﬂux temporarily halts be-
fore it breaches the photosphere, most of the return current
is pushed aside by the subjacent direct current and remains
trapped below the surface.

We use two datasets per day, 12 hours apart, to calculate
the magnetic shear for a 5-day time period after the ARs be-
gan to emerge. The daily averages are listed in Table 1, to-

gether with the daily averages of |DC/RC|. The PIL-shear
is much stronger in AR 11158 than in AR 11072. The aver-
age shear-angle is Φ = 63.6◦±6.9◦ for AR 11158, compared
to only Φ = 25.1◦ ± 6.4◦ for AR 11072.

3.2. Two Well-Developed ARs

Figure 3 shows the two developed ARs. As before, we
analyze the evolution for a 5-day period, but use only one
dataset per day because, unlike emerging ARs, developed
ARs evolve much more slowly and one dataset per day is suf-
ﬁcient for the purpose of this study. Both ARs were near the
central meridian on the third day of this period (N 17S03 at
00:00 UT on 9 March 2012 and S12W 01 at 16:00 UT on 23
October 2014 for ARs 11429 and 12192, respectively), and
within 35◦ from the central meridian on all other days. The
yellow (black) dashed line contours show the integration ar-
eas within which DC/RC is calculated. Although both ARs
have complex magnetic conﬁgurations, |DC/RC| is signiﬁ-
cantly larger than unity for 11429 during the whole time pe-
riod, while it remains close to unity for AR 12192 at all times.
As for the emerging ARs described in § 3.1, the current-
distribution is characterized by small alternating patches of
direct and return currents, and the current-neutralized region
(AR 12192) does not show a coherent, large-scale pattern of
direct current around its PIL, while the non-neutralized re-
gion (AR 11429) does (albeit not as pronounced as in AR
11158).

Our measurements of the PIL-shear and |DC/RC| are
shown in Table 1. The average shear angle of AR 11429 is
Φ = 67.4◦ ± 8.5◦, almost identical to the value obtained for
the likewise CME-producing AR 11158. For AR 12192, we
ﬁnd an average shear angle of Φ = 41.2◦ ± 11.3◦, which is
signiﬁcantly larger than for the likewise current-neutralized
AR 11072. The 5-day-averaged values of |DC/RC| for the
two regions are 2.17 ± 0.01 and 1.06 ± 0.01, respectively.

4. DISCUSSION

We investigated the possible existence of a relationship
between electric-current neutralization, PIL magnetic shear,
and the eruptive activity of solar ARs. To this end, we con-
sidered a sample of four ARs, including emerging and well-
developed ones, as well as quiet and eruptive ones. Using
HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld data, we obtained the electric-
current distribution, measured the magnetic shear along the
main PIL, and tracked eruptive activity over a time period of
5–6 days for each AR. Table 2 shows an overview of the AR
properties relevant for our investigation. Our results can be
summarized as follows.

(1) No AR showed signatures of a coherent pattern of re-
turn current that would surround a central direct current, as
often assumed in theoretical considerations (see the Introduc-
tion). Rather, the return currents were distributed in small
patches, alternating with neighboring patches of direct cur-
rent. On the other hand, two ARs had an organized pattern of

4

direct current, which manifests itself as an elongated, double-
J-shaped structure bracketing the PIL.

(2) The most striking differences can be found between
the ARs that produce CMEs and those that do not. The
two CME-producing ARs (one emerging, one developed)
are characterized by |DC/RC| values clearly exceeding
unity1,
the presence of a double-J-shaped direct-current
channel around the PIL, and an almost identical PIL-shear
of about 65◦.
In contrast, the ARs that did not produce
CMEs (one emerging, one developed) were characterized by
|DC/RC| ≈ 1, i.e., almost perfect current-neutralization,
the absence of a direct-current channel around the PIL, and
signiﬁcantly smaller PIL-shear. Out of the quantities we
considered, these two ARs differed only in their PIL-shear,
which was about 25◦ for the AR that produced no signiﬁcant
ﬂares, and about 40◦ for the one that did.

Our results support the association between strong PIL-
shear and substantial net-currents found in simulations (Sec-
tion 1). This association is seemingly not simple, though,
as considerable shear was present also in our current-
neutralized ARs. Furthermore, they suggest that return cur-
rents are not relevant for an AR’s ability to produce CMEs,
as those currents do not form coherent structures that could
substantially alter the hoop force in a direct-current channel
above the AR’s eruptive PIL. The reason why the current-
neutralized ARs in our sample do not produce CMEs rather
seems to be the absence of such a channel. This supports
CME-models that invoke net currents and the hoop force (see
the discussion in T¨or¨ok et al. 2014).

Finally, our results indicate that |DC/RC| may constitute
a better quantity for assessing an AR’s ability to produce
CMEs than the PIL-shear, as the differences in the former

quantity appear more pronounced. Equivalently, the presence
or absence of a double-J pattern of direct currents around the
PIL may indicate whether or not an AR will produce CMEs.
On the other hand, it appears that current-neutralized ARs
without such a pattern can still produce strong ﬂares, as AR
12192 demonstrates. Those ﬂares may be merely conﬁned,
though, and their occurrence may require a certain amount of
PIL-shear (the shear in AR 12192 was almost twice as large
as in the quiet AR 11072). It has to be kept in mind, though,
that very strong ﬂares without CMEs are quite rare, and that
AR 12192 was exceptional in this respect (e.g., Sun et al.
2015).

Our conclusions are quite speculative, of course, since
our AR-sample is very small. Similar investigations using
larger samples are required before more deﬁnite conclusions
regarding the potential relationship between the amount of
current-neutralization, PIL magnetic shear, and eruptive ac-
tivity of solar active regions can be drawn. Furthermore,
more numerical investigations are required, to gain a deeper
physical understanding of the factors that determine the
electric-current distribution in ARs and its role for eruptive
activity. The very good agreement of the MHD simulation
by Leake et al. (2013) with the observations of AR 11158
(Figure 2) demonstrates that such simulations, despite vari-
ous idealizations, are well suited for this task.

Figure 1. Top: Maps of Bz (left) and Jz (right) for AR 11158 shortly before the X2.2 ﬂare, with the Jz-integration area shown as contours.
Bz is scaled to ± 1000 G; Jz to ±44 mA cm−2. Green (purple) colors show positive (negative) values of Jz. Bottom: Identiﬁcation of
the integration area. Left: Q-map at the lower boundary based on an NLFFF model. Dark lanes are high-Q contours. Pairs of stars indicate
magnetic-connectivity boundaries. Pink (green) stars are ﬁeld-line foot-points that close within the core region (connect to the outer AR
polarities or remote areas). Right: The yellow region shows the ﬁnal area; cyan regions show pixels that were removed from the initially
extracted region. Selected ﬁeld lines are shown to illustrate the connectivities.

Figure 2. Left, middle: Bz and Jz in quiet AR 11072 on 23 May 2010 and in the ﬂare-productive center of AR 11158 on 15 February 2011.
No core-region mask was used for the well-isolated, bipolar AR 11072. Bottom panels show the evolution of the unsigned magnetic ﬂux (gray
line) and the direct/return current ratio, |DC/RC|. Red (blue) curves show |DC/RC|+ (|DC/RC|−). Error bars are 3σ, estimated from the
inversion-uncertainty of the vector magnetic ﬁeld data (errors smaller than circles are omitted). Right: Corresponding quantities for the MHD
simulation by Leake et al. (2013). |DC/RC| is equal for both polarities; only |DC/RC|+ is plotted. Times and ﬂux are in code units.

aComputed quantities. Φ is the average magnetic shear angle at and around the PIL; |DC/RC| the ratio of total direct and return
current, where |DC/RC| = (|DC/RC|+ + |DC/RC|−)/2. For the two emerging ARs, the daily values are averaged over two data
sets per day.
b Day of a 5-day period when the ARs were visible on the solar disk. The time periods are 21–25 May 2010, 13–17 February 2011,
7–11 March 2012, and 21–25 October 2014 for ARs 11072, 11158, 11429, and 12192, respectively.
c Values averaged over the 5-day period.

Table 2. Relevant AR properties. (cid:104) |DC/RC| (cid:105) and (cid:104) Φ (cid:105) are 5-day average
values; “J-pattern” refers to a coherent direct-current channel around the PIL
(see text); “Flares” refers to strong ﬂares of at least M-class.
