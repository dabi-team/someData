Abstract 

Artificial  atomic  systems  in  solids  are  becoming  increasingly  important  building  blocks  in 

quantum information processing and scalable quantum nanophotonic networks. Yet, synthesis 

of color centers that act as single photon emitters which are suitable for on-chip applications 

is still beyond reach. Here, we report a number of plasma and thermal annealing methods for 

the fabrication of emitters in tape-exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals. A two-

step process comprised of Ar plasma etching and subsequent annealing in Ar is highly robust, 

and yields a seven-fold increase in the concentration of emitters in hBN. The initial plasma 

etching step generates emitters that suffer from blinking and bleaching, whereas the two-step 

process yields emitters that are photostable at room temperature and have an emission energy 

distribution  that  is  red-shifted  relative  to  that  of  pristine  hBN.  An  analysis  of  emitters 

fabricated  by  a  range  of  plasma  and  annealing  treatments,  combined  with  a  theoretical 

investigation of point defects in hBN indicates that single photon emitters characterized by a 

high degree of photostability and emission wavelengths greater than ~700 nm are associated 

with  defect  complexes  that  contain  oxygen.  This  is  further  confirmed  by  generating  the 

emitters  by  annealing  hBN  in  an  oxidative  atmosphere.  Our  findings  advance  present 

understanding  of  the  structure  of  quantum  emitter  in  hBN  and  enhance  the  nanofabrication 

toolkit that is needed to realize integrated quantum nanophotonics based on 2D materials.

Introduction 

Two-dimensional  (2D)  materials  such  as  graphene,  hexagonal  boron  nitride  (hBN)  and 

transition  metal  chalcogenides  are  of  great  interest  in  photonics  and  optoelectronics  due  to 

their unique optoelectronic, layer-dependent properties.1-5 In particular, hBN is a layered wide 

band  gap  semiconductor6  with  covalently  bonded  boron  and  nitrogen  atoms  arranged  in  a 

honeycomb structure.7 Due to its hyperbolic properties, hBN  crystals are frequently used  as 

substrates to enhance electronic and optical properties of other 2D materials.8 Recently, hBN 

has  been  shown  to  host  ultra-bright,  room  temperature,  polarized  emitters  of  non-classical 

light,  attributed  to  localized  point  defects.7,  9-11  12  The  defects  exhibit  a  broad  range  of 

emission energies and their structural origin is a matter of debate. While several methods have 

recently  been  explored,  including  laser  ablation12,  ion/electron  irradiation9  and  chemical 

etching13,  they  have  so  far  had  marginal  success  and  low  emitter  fabrication  yields. 

Consequently,  new  fabrication  techniques  of  photostable  quantum  emitters  are  needed  to 

enable  useful  on-chip  devices14.  Here,  we  elucidate  the  role  of  oxygen  in  fluorescent 

properties  of  hBN  and  show  that  a  two-step  Ar  plasma  etching  and  annealing  process  is  a 

robust,  scalable  method  for  the  fabrication  of  photostable  single  photon  emitters  (SPEs)  in 

hBN. The ability to engineer the emitters deterministically in specific hBN crystals opens new 

pathways to integrate them in quantum nanophotonic devices.15 

Results and Discussions 

We  start  by  demonstrating  controlled  fabrication  of  single  photon  emitters  in  hBN  by  Ar 

plasma etching. Figures 1a and 1b show an optical microscope image of tape-exfoliated hBN 

crystals on a silicon substrate, and a schematic illustration of the plasma etch process. Figures 

1c  and  1d  show  normalized,  panchromatic  confocal  PL  maps  acquired  at  room  temperature 

from the same crystal before and after Ar plasma etching. Unless noted otherwise, all samples 

were annealed in Ar at 850 ¬∫C before and after plasma processing using the procedure detailed 

3 

 
   
 
 
 
in Methods. The first annealing step is used to show that plasma processing is the dominant 

step  responsible  for  emitter  generation,  while  the  subsequent  annealing  step  stabilizes  the 

emitters, as is discussed later. Red circles show the locations of emitters found in the crystals 

by  a  pixel-by-pixel  analysis  of  spectra  acquired  from  the  PL  maps.  The  plasma  treatment 

elevates PL intensity preferentially at crystal edges and grain boundaries, which is where most 

of the SPEs discussed below are located in both as-prepared and plasma-processed samples. 

The  preferential  decoration  of  edges  and  extended  defects  by  emitters  is  consistent  with 

previous studies of hBN.9  The as-prepared crystals contain very few emitters prior to etching, 

and they are all located at bright edge site regions, as is seen in  Figure 1c. Plasma processing 

increased the number of emitters by a factor of three in this particular field of view, and some 

of the new emitters are present away from the edges of the flakes shown in Figure 1d.  

Emitters  in  hBN  are  known  to  possess  a  broad  range  of  zero  phonon  lines  (ZPLs), 

attributed  tentatively  to  variations  in  the  structural  compositions  and  charge  states  of  color 

centers, local dielectric environments and strain.9, 13, 16 Figure 1e therefore shows histograms 

of  ZPL  wavelengths  for  all  emitters  found  in  5  different  fields  of  view,  the  total  area  of 

crystals in each field is smaller than ~ 40 √ó 40 ¬µm2, before (8 emitters) and after (66 emitters) 

the  Ar  plasma  treatment.  Both  histograms  peak  around  600  nm,  but  the  plasma  treatment 

yields  emitters  with  a  broader  range  of  ZPL  wavelengths  and,  notably,  some  emitters  with 

wavelengths  longer  than  750  nm.  A  number  of  representative  normalized  spectra  from 

emitters generated by the plasma treatment are shown in Figure 1f.  

We  proceed  to  characterize  quantum  optical  properties  of  the  emitters.  Figure  2a 

shows the ZPLs of a representative emitter produced by the Ar plasma etch process obtained 

at  room  temperature  and  11K,  the  spectra  were  fitted  with  a  Lorentz  function.  The  ZPLs 

maximum are located at ~ 711 nm and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is ~ 16 nm at 

room  temperature  and  ~  2.8nm  at  11K,  respectively.  In  all  our  experiments,  we  did  not 

observe  a  spectrometer  limited  FWHM  of  the  emitters.  The  associated  broadening  at  room 

4 

 
   
 
 
temperature  is  likely  caused  by  spectral  diffusion  or  low  energy  phonon  coupling.17  To 

evaluate the excited state lifetime of the emitter, the PL decay time was measured using a 512 

nm pulsed laser (Figure 2b) at room temperature, yielding an excited state lifetime of 2.4 ns 

after fit the curve with double-exponential. The lifetime is consistent with previous reports on 

single  photon  sources  in  hBN  crystals.7  The  inset  of  figure  2b  shows  is  the  second  order 

autocorrelation  function  (g(2)(œÑ))  obtained  from  this  emitter.  The  dip  at  zero  delay  is  well 

below 0.5 (g(2)(0) ~ 0.1), confirming that the defect is a true single photon emitter.7 The curve 

was  fit  with  a  three-level  model,  where  t1  and  t2 are  excited  and  metastable  state  lifetimes, 

respectively.

Overall, 10 out of the 66 emitters prepared with this method are single photon emitters. The 

rest  showed  very  shallow  dip  indicating  they  are  ensembles.  Figure  2c  depicts  the 

fluorescence intensity as a function of excitation power. A standard three level system that has 

a ground, excited and a long lived metastable state was used to fit the data using the following

where I‚àû and Pmax are the emission rate and the excitation power at saturation, respectively. 

The saturation emission rate for this emitter is 5.4 √ó104 at a saturation power of 910 ¬µW. The 

brightness  is  comparable  to  previous  reports  of  emitters  in  tape  exfoliated  hBN  crystals.13 

Most  emitters  found  after  the  Ar  plasma  etching  were  not  stable  and  bleach  in  seconds.  A 

post-etching  annealing  treatment  was  therefore  performed  to  stabilize  the  emitters.  This  is 

demonstrated in Figure 2f which compares the stability of emitters measured before and after 

annealing  (additional  stability  curves  are  shown  in  Figure  S1).  The  same  technique  can  be 

effectively  used  to  pattern  hBN  flakes  using  selective  masking  to  form  emitter  arrays.  An 

example of such an array is shown in Figure S2.

To  study  the  effects  of  plasma  etching  on  hBN  crystals,  part  of  a  hBN  crystal  was 

covered  with  photo-resist  to  protect  the  flake  during  plasma  processing.  Atomic  force 

microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy and X-Ray photoemission were then used to study 

the samples. Figure 3a shows an optical image of the hBN crystal obtained after etching. Red 

dashed  lines  indicate  the  boundary  between  the  etched/protected  areas,  and  the  height 

difference is easily observed as a change in contrast in the image18. Figure 3b shows a height 

image of the sample surface obtained using AFM. The surface of the protected hBN remains 

very  smooth  (RMS  roughness  ~  0.65  nm)  which  suggests  it  was  not  damaged  during  the 

etching  process.  By  contrast,  the  etched  area  contains  randomly  distributed  nano-islands 

(RMS  roughness  ~  0.91  nm).19-20  Furthermore,  Ar  plasma  etching  produces  a  ~  2  nm  step 

(Figure 3b and c) at the etched-protected interface, suggesting that the fabricated new emitters 

are  located  in  the  top  four  layers  of  the  exfoliated  hBN  flake.  The  maximum  penetration 

ranges  of  Ar+  and  O+  ions  and  the  corresponding  vacancy  generation  depth  profiles  were 

simulated using the Monte Carlo code SRIM (stopping range of ions in matter).21 The results 

are  shown  in  figure  3d  for  an  accelerating  voltage  of  400V  (the  self-biased  voltage  of  the 

plasma system under the conditions used in this work, see Methods for details). Most of the 

ions penetrate 2 - 3nm below the hBN crystal surface, confirming that the plasma process is 

very  shallow,  and  the  emitters  are  fabricated  within  the  top  few  nanometers  of  the  surface. 

Argon  and  oxygen  plasma  treatments  are  both  known  to  remove  organic  surface  adsorbates 

and etch 2D layered materials with controlled etching rates.22-28 The accelerated ions are also 

capable of breaking N-B bonds and creating N vacancies in the hBN lattice. As revealed by 

previous  research19-20,  22,  N  vacancies  generated  by  Ar  plasma  etching  are  expected  to  be 

decorated with O atoms once exposed to air.  

Figure  3e  shows  Raman  spectra  from  the  pristine  and  etched  hBN  regions  of  the 

crystal. A characteristic peak corresponding to the E2g phonon mode occurs at ~1395 cm-1

, in 

etched samples, the Raman peak is slightly shifted, typically to 1393 cm-1. On the other hand, 
6 

 
   
 
 
the FWHMs in the etched samples is smaller than in the pristine ones.18 The red-shifted and 

sharpened  Raman  peaks  and  the  rougher  surface  on  the  etched  flake  suggest  that  covalent 

bonds and strain in the crystals were altered, especially at the edge/grain boundaries.18-20, 22, 29 

To  confirm  the  presence  of  the  oxygen  atoms  in  the  hBN  lattice,  X-ray  photoemission 

spectrum was performed on the Ar plasma treated samples as shown in figure 3f. The binding 

energy profile of B1s consists of 5 peaks located at 189.4, 190.5, 191.6, 192.6, 193.3eV. The 

peaks at 192.6 and 193.3eV suggests the formation of the B-N-O complex.19-20 30-31  Thus, we 

propose that the emitters generated by the Ar plasma treatment may be attributed to an oxygen 

related vacancy complex. Note that the emitters generated by an oxygen plasma (Figure S3) 

are  different  from  the  Ar  plasma  as  the  defects  are  oxidized  simultaneously  during  the  etch 

process.23 Consequently,  the emission from oxygen plasma treated hBN would originate from 

boron oxides, which are known to be bleach in seconds.32 

To further confirm our hypothesis, we annealed hBN crystals in oxidative atmosphere 

under ambient pressure at 750¬∞C for 30 minutes. At this temperature, pristine hBN crystals, 

even  monolayers,  are  unlikely  to  be  oxidized33,  regardless  of  thickness,  but  defects  at  grain 

boundaries  may  potentially  be  modified  in  the  oxidizing  atmosphere.  Figure  4a  shows  a 

normalized  PL  intensity  map  obtained  from  a  hBN  crystal  that  was  annealed  in  air.  The 

positions of emitters found in this crystal are indicated by red circles, all of which are located 

at grain boundaries.  AFM was used to study the morphology of this flake, as shown in figure 

4b, adjacent flakes crumpled to form ridges at the grain boundary with a height of around 300 

nm. We found that the emitters were mostly likely located at the ridges after correlate the PL 

mapping  and  the  AFM  image.  The  pristine  defects  in  hBN  are  located  at  the  edges  of  the 

flakes  and  the  ZPLs  range  from  550nm  to  650  nm,  which  is  in  consistent  with  previous 

reports.9-12  In  comparison,  the  new  emitters  are  preferentially  located  at  the  ridges,  or  grain 

boundaries, with longer emission wavelength, which would be resulted from oxygen doping. 

7 

 
   
 
 
Figure 4c shows the PL spectra from a native defect and oxygen related defect on this crystal. 

The polar graph in figure 4d shows the emission from the new emitters are linearly polarized. 

To confirm that oxygen indeed plays a role in generating the quantum emitters, first-

principles  calculations  are  performed  on  intrinsic  vacancy  defects  and  vacancies  decorated 

with  oxygen  atoms  using  the  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  method  (See  Figure  S4-S6  in 

Supporting  Information).  Several  defects,  i.e.  the  anti-site  vacancy,  N-vacancy,  B-vacancy 

and interlayer bonding, have previously been proposed to be responsible for the broad range 

of  ZPL  energies  in  hBN  and  evaluated  using  the  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof  (PBE)  functional 

(See Methods).7, 13 However, as it is widely accepted that PBE functional underestimates the 

electronic band gaps of semiconductors, we used hybrid functional (HSE06) to obtain more 

accurate  electronic  band  structures  (See  details  in  Methods),  and  to  evaluate  a  number  of 

oxygen-related defects in hBN. Due to the presence of dangling bonds in the vacancies, the 

adsorption of O atoms is energetically favorable, resulting in a range of impurity states within 

the wide band gap of h-BN. Assuming that only spin-preserving transitions are allowed, we 

find that the B-vacancy defect saturated with two oxygen atoms (VBO2), as shown in Figure 

5a,  is  the  most  likely  candidate  for  color  centers  with  longer  wavelength  emission.  The 

calculated  energy  levels  in  Figure  5b  show  that  there  is  a  single  transition  from  a  potential 

ground state at 0.98 eV to a potential excited state located at 2.83 eV, resulting in a transition 

with an energy of 1.85 eV, which is very close to the experimental results. Note that quasi-

particle approximation is not considered here due to extremely large amount of calculations in 

this system and thus this value is slightly larger than the measured values (a ZPL centered on 

718  nm,  corresponding  to  ~1.73  eV).  Since  this  transition  is  optically  polarized  and  occur 

between highly localized HOMO-LUMO states, therefore this defect is most likely to be the 

source of clean emission seen in experiment. All the other oxygen related defects do not have 

such  atomic  like  states  and  defect  levels  are  somehow  mixed  with  the  bulk  bands  therefore 

they are less likely to be responsible for the seen single photon emission.

Conclusion 

In conclusion, we were able to engineer single emitters in hBN flakes by employing an argon 

plasma treatment. We showed that post-etching annealing process is required to stabilize the 

emitters,  and  the  overall  number  of  emitters  increases  by  a  factor  of  seven.  AFM 

measurements confirmed that the new emitters are localized within the top few layers of hBN 

and X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy confirms the presence of oxygen atoms after plasma 

etching.  Density  functional  theory  elucidates  on  the  possibility  of  oxygen  related  defects  in 

hBN  crystal  matches  well  with  our  experimental  results.  While  further  measurements  are 

needed  to  understand  the  origin  of  the  emission,  our  results  provide  a  compelling  first 

evidence towards scalable engineering and patterning of room temperature quantum emitters 

in layered materials.  

Methods 

Sample fabrication: The hBN crystals were produced at atmospheric pressure using a molten 

mixture of nickel and chromium (weight ratio, 1:1) as the solvent, and isotopically enriched 

boron-10 metal as the boron source.  The mixture was heated to and held at 1550 ¬∞C for 24 

hours  under  flowing  nitrogen.    Slow  (4¬∞C/hour)  cooling  of  this  solution  caused  the  hBN 

crystals to precipitate on the metal alloy surface.34-35 

High quality hBN single crystals were mechanically exfoliated with scotch tape onto a 

Si substrate with a 300nm thermal oxide capping layer. The crystals were annealed at 850¬∞C 

in  Ar  for  30  min  after  a  cleaning  process  comprised  of  a  450¬∞C  anneal  in  air  and  a  benign 

oxygen  plasma  treatment.  These  ‚Äúas-prepared  samples‚Äù  were  pre-characterised,  and  loaded 

into a vacuum chamber for Ar or O2 plasma etching using a system equipped with a 13MHz 

radio-frequency  (RF)  plasma  generator.  The  crystals  were  etched  with  a  power  of  200  W 

9 

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
under a pressure of 180 moor for 2 mins at room temperature. Under these conditions the ions 

were  accelerated  by  a  DC  self-bias  of  ~  400V.  The  crystals  were  subsequently  annealed  at 

850¬∞C in Ar for 30mins to stabilize the emitters after plasma processing. The exfoliated hBN 

were also annealed at 750¬∞C in air for 30mins, knowns as annealed in oxidative environment. 

Optical Characterization: A home-built confocal setup was used for optical characterization 

of the crystals. Samples were excited with a 532 nm continuous wave (CW) laser (Gem 532‚Ñ¢, 

Laser  Quantum  Ltd.)  directed  through  a  Glan-Taylor  polarizer  (Thorlabs  Inc.)  and  a  half 

waveplate, and focused onto the sample using a high numerical aperture (NA = 0.9, Nikon) 

objective  lens.    An  X-Y  piezo  scanning  mirror  (FSM-300‚Ñ¢)  was  used  to  perform  confocal 

scanning. The excitation laser light was blocked with a 532 nm dichroic mirror (532 nm laser 

BrightLine‚Ñ¢, Semrock) and a tilted 580nm long pass filter (Semrock) at the collection end. 

The PL at cryogenic temperature were collected by placing the hBN crystals in a home-built 

open-loop  cryostat  with  flown  liquid  helium.  The  sample  was  excited  with  a  computer-

controlled  continuous-wave  (CW)  Ti:Sap  laser  (SolsTis,  M2  Inc.)  The  signal  was  then 

coupled  into  a  graded  index  fiber  and  a  fiber  splitter  was  used  to  direct  the  light  to  a 

spectrometer  (Acton  SpectraPro‚Ñ¢,  Princeton  Instrument  Inc.)  or  to  two  avalanche 

photodiodes  (Excelitas  Technologies‚Ñ¢)  to  collect  spectra  or  autocorrelation  data.  PL 

mappings were gernerated using the photons collected from one of the APDs. Autocorrelation 

measurements were performed in a Hunbury Brown-Twiss configuration where the emission 

was  equally  separated  and  directed  into  two  APDs.  Lifetime  measurements  were  performed 

using a 512 nm pulsed laser excitation source (PiL051X‚Ñ¢, Advanced Laser Diode Systems 

GmbH) with a 100 ps pulse width and a 10 MHz repetition rate. 

Simulations:  All  calculations  are  performed  by  using  DFT  method  as  implemented  in  the 

Vienna  Ab  initio  Simulation  Package  (VASP).36  The  interaction  between  valence  electrons 

and ions is described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, and (PBE) functional 

is chosen for the exchange and correlation interactions in geometric optimiztion.37 Bearing in 
10 

 
   
 
 
mind, the PBE always underestimates the energy band gaps of extended systems due to the 

delocalized description of electrons, the screened hybrid HSE06 functional is used to obtain 

more  accurate  electronic  band  structures  by  mixing  semi-local  and  Hartree-Fock  exchange, 

which has been widely tested in previous calculations.38 A plane-wave basis set with a kinetic 

energy  cutoff  of  500  eV  is  used  for  all  calculations.  Pristine  single-layer  hBN  was  first 

geometry-optimized using the conventional cell and a 18 √ó 18 √ó 1 Monkhurst‚ÄìPack reciprocal 

space grid to an energy tolerance of 0.01 eV. A supercell containing 6 √ó 6 unit cells of h-BN 

and  the  vacuum  thickness  of  15  √Ö  is  adopted  to  avoid  the  interaction  between  two 

neighboring defects.
